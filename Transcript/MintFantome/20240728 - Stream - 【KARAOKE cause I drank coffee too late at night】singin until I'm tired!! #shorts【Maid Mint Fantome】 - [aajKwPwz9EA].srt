1
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,710
It's still 360p!

2
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,350
It's still 360p!

3
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,530
It's still 360p!

4
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,210
It is!

5
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,720
But I did the output!

6
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,940
Oh no...

7
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,440
But

8
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,100
I did the output!

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,940
Big Mac!

10
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,420
No!

11
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,780
What do I do?

12
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,300
360p stream and sing old songs.

13
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,320
Now I'm tired.

14
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,560
Because I'm tired of this bullshit!

15
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,420
What the hell?

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,790
Does it sound okay at least?

17
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,890
People who watch the Vaan are going to be so confused.

18
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,430
I can say buddy on Bandwidth.

19
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,490
It sounds okay?

20
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,930
You sound fine?

21
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,050
Let's do a test song and see how it sounds then.

22
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:25,730
Maybe.

23
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,330
What would be...

24
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,750
I think I know a good song for this...

25
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,610
For this...

26
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,470
For this...

27
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,210
For this...

28
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,530
Hold on.

29
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,310
Let's see if I can find it.

30
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,050
Oh!

31
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,110
I found it!

32
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,470
Okay, I'm gonna sing this song.

33
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,390
Oh!

34
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,310
I forgot to turn on the...

35
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:58,490
Okay.

36
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,410
I'm gonna make sure...

37
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:00,570
Okay.

38
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,790
This is a test to see if the audio gets all wacky too.

39
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,720
It just jumped?

40
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:14,400
Oh!

41
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,380
Wait!

42
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,680
I don't wanna sing this then!

43
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,000
Ai-yai-yai!

44
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,720
Ai-yai-yai!

45
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,820
Ai-yai-yai!

46
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,440
Where's my samurai?

47
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:51,620
I'm a search for a man All across Japan Just to find, to find my samurai Someone who is strong But still a little shy Yes, I need, I need my samurai Ai-yai!

48
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:59,040
I'm your little bunch of fly Green, black, and blue Make the colors in the sky Ai-yai-yai!

49
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,440
I'm your little bunch of...

50
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:27,390
I've been searching through the woods And high up on the hills Just to find, to find my samurai Someone who won't regret To keep me in his net Yes, I need, I need my samurai Ai-yai-yai!

51
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:34,530
I'm your little bunch of fly Green, black, and blue Make the colors in the sky Ai-yai-yai!

52
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:42,310
I'm your little bunch of fly Green, black, and blue Make the colors in the sky Ai-yai-yai!

53
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,050
Ai-yai-yai!

54
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,670
Ai-yai-yai!

55
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,690
Where's my samurai?

56
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,370
Ai-yai-yai!

57
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,150
Ai-yai-yai!

58
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,730
Ai-yai-yai!

59
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,790
Where's my samurai?

60
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,850
Oh, I don't know this part.

61
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,220
Butterfly.

62
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,700
Smile, DK.

63
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,240
Ai-yai-yai!

64
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:17,300
I'm your little bunch of fly Green, black, and blue Make the colors in the sky Ai-yai-yai!

65
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:24,480
I'm your little bunch of fly Green, black, and blue Make the colors in the sky Ai-yai-yai!

66
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,920
I'm your little bunch of fly Green, black, and blue Make the colors in the sky Ai-yai

67
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,080
-yai!

68
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,180
Make the colors in the sky Ai-yai-yai!

69
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,340
Ai-yai

70
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,600
-yai!

71
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,760
Where's my samurai?

72
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,550
Song for 360p!

73
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,550
But now I'm in 1080p!

74
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,550
The effect is ruined.

75
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,070
Ai-yai-yai!

76
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:05,190
I'm your little butterfly Green, black, and blue Make the colors in the sky

77
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,280
Am I actually...

78
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,700
Oh, gosh.

79
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,460
Okay, well...

80
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,440
Welcome, everybody!

81
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,620
Ai...

82
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,700
It's awkward now.

83
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,240
Because the start of the stream is weird.

84
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,120
Now...

85
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,960
I'm watching in 360p.

86
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,480
Okay, good.

87
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,960
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

88
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,360
Welcome.

89
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,580
I manually set you to 140p.

90
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,060
144p.

91
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,880
I just can't see more than 480p.

92
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,700
I don't believe that.

93
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,100
The start of all your streams are weird.

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,240
Shut up.

95
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,240
Shut up.

96
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,660
Yeah.

97
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,680
I drank some coffee.

98
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,640
And I was like...

99
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,060
Because I just did a meet and greet at a convention.

100
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,920
And now I'm like...

101
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,240
Well...

102
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,380
What do I do to burn all this energy off?

103
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,720
Why not do a crazy karaoke?

104
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,880
So...

105
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,340
I'm just gonna sing whatever I want.

106
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,220
And...

107
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,860
Burn the Zoomy energy.

108
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,580
Yeah!

109
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,600
I'll do it until I'm tired.

110
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,300
And...

111
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,040
Isn't it like 10pm?

112
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,560
It's like 11pm.

113
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,240
And I had coffee.

114
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,400
For the...

115
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,480
For the meet and greet.

116
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,840
Because I had to be...

117
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,460
I had to be energetic and excited to see people.

118
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,100
Of course.

119
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,840
So...

120
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,300
So...

121
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,980
Sing and dance.

122
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,200
I don't know.

123
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,440
What to do.

124
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,860
What's another one?

125
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,920
What's another song?

126
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,180
Oh my gosh.

127
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,260
Now I did Butterfly.

128
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,860
That was Butterfly from Smile DK.

129
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,420
That's...

130
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,020
From DDR.

131
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,000
DDR.

132
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,120
But now I'm like...

133
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,040
Should I do like...

134
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,320
I don't know.

135
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,460
I saw some people being like...

136
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:56,500
Oh.

137
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,040
Guess I won't go to sleep now.

138
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,040
Crazy Frog!

139
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,140
Okay.

140
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,840
I'll do all the...

141
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll do all the crazy songs.

142
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,060
And then we'll do...

143
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,300
Is that even SuperBallet?

144
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:06,620
See!

145
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh my gosh.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,940
I hope you're having fun.

147
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:09,880
Wait.

148
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,520
Who does a Crazy Frog?

149
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,500
Wait.

150
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,140
Crazy Frog.

151
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,960
Jingle Bells?

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,400
Wait.

153
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,360
DDR songs only.

154
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,540
Axel F?

155
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:23,820
Okay.

156
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,320
I don't know.

157
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:24,700
I don't know.

158
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:24,920
I don't know.

159
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,260
Who's going to pull this off?

160
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,540
Okay.

161
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,600
I'll do all the crazy songs.

162
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,900
And then I'll do the slow songs to wind us down, right?

163
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,140
Oh.

164
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,220
How does this go?

165
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,500
Ding.

166
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:35,720
Ding.

167
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,520
Ding.

168
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,900
This is the Crazy Frog!

169
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:01,990
Ding.

170
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,370
Ding.

171
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,160
Ding.

172
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,480
Ding.

173
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,440
Ding.

174
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:11,800
Ding.

175
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:11,920
Ding.

176
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,540
Ding.

177
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,120
This is the crazy frog!

178
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,620
This is the crazy frog!

179
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,220
I never knew Axl Phantom...

180
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,220
I never knew that this song had...

181
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,420
Wait, I kind of want to hear what the person sounds like.

182
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,880
In KaraFunk, you can hear what the person...

183
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,480
Okay, here.

184
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,140
Let's see.

185
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,200
Let's listen to the lead person real quick.

186
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,120
Okay.

187
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,300
There we go!

188
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,260
That was fun.

189
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,020
That was good.

190
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,480
Good suggestion, everybody.

191
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,460
I feel crazy right now.

192
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,900
It sounded perfect.

193
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,460
Thank you.

194
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,540
Somebody scream!

195
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,100
Somebody scream!

196
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,600
It's like my favorite sample ever.

197
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,680
Scatman!

198
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,370
I think it's just the 20 gifted.

199
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:49,030
I'm the Scatman!

200
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,260
It's actually worse than the song.

201
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,400
Everybody's saying it's the Scatman stutters, but he doesn't ever stutter when he sings.

202
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,180
But when you don't know what I'm going to tell you now, that the stutter and the scat is the same thing.

203
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,100
Yo, I'm the Scatman!

204
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,580
Where's the Scatman?

205
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,800
I'm the Scatman!

206
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,260
Why should we be lazy and unapologetically heathen?

207
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,820
And who would change you with a season if they could?

208
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,400
The state of the condition insults my intuitions and it only makes me crazy in the heart like the wood.

209
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,940
Everybody stutters one way or the other.

210
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,500
So check out my message to you.

211
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
As a matter of fact, don't let nothing hold you back.

212
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,400
If the Scatman can do it, bother who can you?

213
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,280
Oh brother, say that man.

214
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,220
I'm the Scatman!

215
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,300
Everybody stutters one way or the other.

216
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,520
So check out my message to you.

217
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,740
As a matter of fact, don't let nothing hold you back.

218
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,440
If the Scatman can do it, bother who can you?

219
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,460
I hear a little ask of the many of Scat...

220
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:38,880
Whoa.

221
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,800
Sleeping the saints and we weeping cause things are gone dead.

222
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,060
Haven't had the chance to be bored.

223
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,120
I'm the Scatman!

224
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,360
Ba da lap.

225
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,760
Wee ba ba ba da bum.

226
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,560
Ba ba ba da bum.

227
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,340
Wee ba ba ba da bum.

228
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,940
Ba ba ba da bum.

229
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,820
Wee ba ba ba da bum.

230
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,880
Ski-bee dee dib-a-dee dum-dum dum.

231
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,520
Yum dum dum dum.

232
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:20,700
Ski-bee dee dib-a-dee yum-dum-dum-dum.

233
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,380
That was the scat man.

234
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,260
With the scat plan.

235
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,820
Wait... maybe not.

236
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,960
Any openings from Full Metal Panic?

237
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,880
I appreciate you.

238
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,660
I think I only know one...

239
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,120
One Full Metal Panic song.

240
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,840
Mambo No.

241
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,520
5!

242
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,980
Oh my god.

243
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,640
Why is multiple people requesting?

244
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,680
I can do it.

245
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,980
Mambo No.

246
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,480
5.

247
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,780
I don't plan on doing...

248
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,800
Here, let me write the Full Metal Panic.

249
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,440
For later.

250
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,080
I don't plan on only just doing Japanese songs or English songs.

251
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,000
So, you know...

252
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,080
Um...

253
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,000
This is certainly nailing the caffeine high vibe.

254
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,440
Oh my gosh.

255
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,200
I'm so excited.

256
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,760
Mambo No.

257
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,360
5!

258
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,560
Oh, ladies and gentlemen.

259
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,140
This is Mambo No.

260
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:19,620
5.

261
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,940
One, two, three, four, five.

262
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,500
Everybody in the car.

263
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,700
So come on, let's ride.

264
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,980
To the liquor store around the corner.

265
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,000
The boys say they want some gin and juice.

266
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,860
But I really don't wanna...

267
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,780
Be a buzz.

268
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,520
Like I had last week, I must stay deep.

269
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,780
Cause talk is cheap.

270
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,680
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita.

271
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,480
And as I continue, you know you're getting sweeter.

272
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,800
What can I do?

273
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,860
I really beg you, my lord.

274
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,980
To me, flirting is just like a sport.

275
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,980
Anything's fly, it's all good.

276
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,860
Let me jump in and send in the trumpet.

277
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,440
A little bit of Monica in my life.

278
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,160
A little bit of Erica by my side.

279
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,940
A little bit of Rita's all I need.

280
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,480
A little bit of Tina.

281
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,600
She knows what I see.

282
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,520
A little bit of Sandra in the sun.

283
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,240
A little bit of Mary all night long.

284
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,020
A little bit of Jessica, here I am.

285
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,680
A little bit of you makes me your man.

286
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,040
Jump up and down.

287
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,280
Move it all around.

288
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,740
Shake your head to the sound.

289
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,080
Put your hands on the ground.

290
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,880
Take one step left and one step right.

291
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,640
One to the front and one to the side.

292
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,020
Clap your hands once.

293
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,360
Clap your hands twice.

294
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,960
And if you look like this, then you're doing it right.

295
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,100
A little bit of Monica in my life.

296
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,840
A little bit of Erica by my side.

297
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,580
A little bit of Rita's all I need.

298
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,280
A little bit of Tina's what I see.

299
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,140
A little bit of Sandra in the sun.

300
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,840
A little bit of Mary all night long.

301
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,660
A little bit of Jessica, here I am.

302
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,320
A little bit of you makes me your man.

303
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,580
A little bit of Monica in my life.

304
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,280
A little bit of Erica by my side.

305
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,960
A little bit of Rita's all I need.

306
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,680
A little bit of Tina's what I see.

307
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,560
A little bit of Sandra in the sun.

308
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,260
A little bit of Mary all night long.

309
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,040
A little bit of Jessica, here I am.

310
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,760
A little bit of you makes me your man.

311
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:23,040
I do all to fall in love with a girl like you.

312
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,840
Cause you can't run and you can't hide.

313
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,500
You and me gonna touch the sky.

314
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:30,880
Cause

315
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,670
I'm haunting you guys, you know.

316
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,330
Mambo No.

317
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,290
5.

318
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,710
The lyrics to that are a little...

319
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,460
That's like every Vtuber.

320
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,260
You know, it's just like...

321
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,520
I was scrolling and I didn't expect to come by Yubito.

322
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,020
Hello!

323
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,260
Hello, hello.

324
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,500
She's still doing meme songs throwing in my hat for...

325
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:10,800
Hey...

326
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,080
Hey...

327
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,160
Hey...

328
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,400
Like...

329
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,800
Hey...

330
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,480
What?

331
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,480
Oh, Numa Numa!

332
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,300
I don't know how to sing it though.

333
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:20,820
Okay.

334
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,420
What language is that song in?

335
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,160
Because...

336
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,360
I feel...

337
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,080
I feel...

338
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,780
Like I'm gonna butcher it.

339
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,200
Romanian.

340
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,540
Romanian.

341
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,880
I'm so sorry.

342
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,580
I'll do the Disney version.

343
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:38,940
What?

344
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,000
There's a Disney version?

345
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,900
No way.

346
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,940
Wait, what's it called?

347
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,520
Hold on.

348
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,840
Also, what song did you mean, Nano?

349
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,140
Like...

350
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,860
Yeah, yeah.

351
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

352
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

353
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,180
I said hey.

354
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,720
What's going on?

355
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,520
He-Man song!

356
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,660
What is that song called?

357
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,280
My he.

358
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,920
My ya-hoo.

359
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,000
My ya-ha.

360
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,180
My ya-ha-ha.

361
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,520
My ya-hee.

362
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,600
My ya-hoo.

363
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,360
My ya-ha.

364
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,540
My ya-ha-ha.

365
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,960
My ya-hee.

366
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,020
My ya-hoo.

367
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,720
My ya-ha.

368
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,220
My ya-hee.

369
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,380
My ya-hoo.

370
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,100
My ya-ha.

371
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,260
My ya-ha-ha.

372
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:34,540
My ya-hee.

373
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,020
I'm so sorry.

374
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,680
I'm so sorry.

375
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:16,680
I want to play, but it's just me, just me, just me, just me, just me, just me, what can I do, my love, to meet you?

376
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,860
I'm afraid of your eyes.

377
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:31,720
I want to play, but it's just me, just me, just me, just me, what can I do, my love, to meet you?

378
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,320
I'm afraid of your eyes.

379
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,900
I'm calling you.

380
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,360
I'm waiting.

381
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,280
I'm saying.

382
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,240
I'm sorry.

383
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,080
Now.

384
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,000
Hello.

385
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,220
A little pause.

386
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,380
Hello.

387
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:52,960
Hello.

388
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,220
I'm here.

389
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,440
I'm Picasso, I'm David.

390
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,740
And I'm floating.

391
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,860
But I don't know anything.

392
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:15,740
I want to play, but it's just me, just me, just me, just me, just me, what can I do, my love, to meet you?

393
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,320
I'm afraid of your eyes.

394
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,400
I'm afraid of the search.

395
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,780
I want to play.

396
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:30,400
But it's just me, just me, just me, just me, just me, just me I'm afraid of your eyes.

397
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:47,660
My youth, My joy, My beauty, My ability, My passion, My a hundred۔ I'm scared of your eyes.

398
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,260
I'm calling you.

399
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,300
Just me, just me, just me, just me, just me, just me, just me, just me, just me, just me, just me I'm asking for your love.

400
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:54,060
Maya ha ha, maya hi, maya hu, maya ha

401
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:35,760
Vresa vresa, numa numa ye, numa numa ye Numa numa numa ye, ti putausi, drago sam di te Me omitaste o kitai ye Vresa vresa, numa numa ye, numa numa ye Numa numa numa ye, ti putausi, drago sam di te Me omitaste o kitai ye Oh, I forgot to put the setlist.

402
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,960
Sorry, that was...

403
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,880
Oh, drago...

404
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,620
I think I spelled that right.

405
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,960
The music video for that is crazy.

406
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,820
Oh my god, because it's saying aqua!

407
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,340
Oh my god, what if they have erotic on here too?

408
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,440
That was amazing!

409
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,320
I'm so sorry, you guys.

410
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,480
I think I really butchered that.

411
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,680
Am I in the 2000s?

412
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,100
I'm sure Romanians are happy.

413
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,280
I'm sure Romanians are asleep.

414
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,060
What was the song?

415
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,340
What was the...

416
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,340
Can you do tequila?

417
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,920
Spanish song...

418
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,080
Brujeria?

419
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,320
One of the songs Iron Mouse sings.

420
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,980
Oh my gosh, I don't even know it though.

421
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,240
What's the...

422
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,220
What is that one?

423
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,820
What's it called?

424
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,660
The Parent Trap song.

425
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,820
Wait, I don't know that one either.

426
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,040
They have a wonderful energy.

427
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,060
Thank you!

428
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,140
Oh, what's going on?

429
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,120
Is that what it's called?

430
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,100
What's going on?

431
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:45,940
I actually don't...

432
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,540
You know what?

433
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,460
I think I don't know what that song is.

434
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,440
Is this it?

435
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:51,880
I wonder.

436
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,060
Four non-blondes.

437
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,040
Oh wait.

438
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,260
I don't think this is it.

439
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,960
Four blondes?

440
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,680
I don't think that's it.

441
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,740
Wait, four blondes.

442
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:10,980
Wait, that's it?

443
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,700
Oh gosh, I don't know this song at all.

444
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,440
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait.

445
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,600
I think...

446
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,860
Why is there four...

447
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,100
Oh.

448
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,720
Wait, let me try this one.

449
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,700
Four non-blondes.

450
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,180
Why are they not blonde?

451
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,820
Yeah, this is more like it.

452
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,660
This is more like it.

453
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,140
Yeah, yeah.

454
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,700
Years ago my life...

455
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,400
Trying to get out that...

456
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,760
Big hill of hope.

457
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,100
For a destination.

458
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,120
Am I singing it right?

459
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,060
Who cares?

460
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,300
I quickly realized quickly when I knew I should.

461
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,840
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man.

462
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,560
For whatever that means.

463
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,420
I don't know.

464
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,600
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed.

465
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,280
Just to get all out what's in my head.

466
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,100
And I'm...

467
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,820
I'm feeling...

468
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,900
A little peculiar.

469
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,240
It's got a weird phasing, it does.

470
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,760
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside.

471
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,660
And I take a deep breath and I get real high.

472
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,500
And I scream...

473
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,300
Oh, I scream from the top of my lungs.

474
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,160
What's going on?

475
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,380
And I say...

476
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,620
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

477
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,980
Hey, yeah, yeah.

478
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,700
I said hey.

479
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,520
What's going on?

480
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
And I say...

481
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,020
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,120
Hey, yeah, yeah.

483
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,860
I said hey.

484
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,540
What's going on?

485
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,500
And

486
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,670
I try.

487
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,250
Oh my god do I try.

488
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,410
I try all the time.

489
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:07,530
And I pray, oh my God, do I pray.

490
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:14,510
I pray every single day for a revolution.

491
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:24,350
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed just to get it all, what's in my head.

492
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:28,970
And I'm feeling a little peculiar.

493
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,690
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside.

494
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,450
And I take a deep breath and I get real high.

495
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,850
And I scream from the top of my lungs, what's going on?

496
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:51,610
And I say, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

497
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,550
I say, hey.

498
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,210
What's going on?

499
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:05,170
And I say, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

500
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,510
I say, hey.

501
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,090
What's going on?

502
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:19,730
And I say, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

503
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,550
I say, hey.

504
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:21,930
Hey!

505
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,450
What's going on?

506
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:33,970
And I say, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah.

507
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,790
I said, hey!

508
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,370
What's going on?

509
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:05,340
Twenty-five years and my life is still trying to get off that great big hill.

510
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,360
Of hope for a destination.

511
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,420
Guys,

512
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,790
Joy Tom Tom, thank you for the double 50 gifted dick.

513
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,970
Did I say that right?

514
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,470
Oh my gosh.

515
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,130
You're the greatest ever do it.

516
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,330
Fast Car by Tracy Chapman.

517
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,270
What's that one?

518
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,270
Fast Car.

519
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,090
I don't know if I know it.

520
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:35,950
Let me hear it.

521
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,850
Duvet by Duvet.

522
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,050
Let me add it.

523
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:40,650
Duvet.

524
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,650
It's such a beautiful voice.

525
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:46,110
Oh, I think I know this one.

526
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,550
We need some Cascada, too.

527
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,650
Mahjong tunes.

528
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,530
Wait, do I know this one?

529
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,530
You've got a fast car.

530
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,030
I wanna take it to anywhere.

531
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,890
Maybe we can make a deal.

532
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,270
Maybe.

533
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,550
Oh my god, look at this.

534
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,670
I don't know if I know it well enough, though.

535
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,490
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose.

536
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,810
Maybe we'll make a deal.

537
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,270
I don't know it well enough.

538
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:18,590
I'm sorry.

539
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,130
I think I know maybe the...

540
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,350
Fast Car.

541
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,810
I don't know it, though.

542
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,370
Maybe I know the chorus.

543
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,650
You've got a fast car.

544
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,090
I've got a plan to get us out of here.

545
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,910
You've been working at a convenience store.

546
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:35,490
I don't know.

547
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:35,950
I'm so sorry.

548
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,150
I know the song, but I don't know the pacing well enough.

549
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,250
I'm so sorry.

550
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,390
I tried.

551
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:41,890
I tried!

552
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,470
I tried.

553
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,810
Okay, back to...

554
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,690
2000 eras.

555
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,610
And I'll do BoA next.

556
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:03,610
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me.

557
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:09,330
I still feel your touch in my dreams.

558
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:17,130
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why.

559
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,350
Without you, it's hard to survive.

560
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:27,250
Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling.

561
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:30,350
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.

562
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:32,930
Can't you feel my heartbeat fast?

563
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,730
I want this to last.

564
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,150
Need you by my side.

565
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,630
Cause every time we touch, I feel the static.

566
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,870
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky.

567
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,510
Can't you hear my heartbeat so?

568
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,230
I can't let you go.

569
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,870
Want you in my life.

570
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,370
Oh

571
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,570
gosh, I'm eating.

572
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,950
Your arms are my castle.

573
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,870
Your heart is my sky.

574
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:45,390
May wipe away tears that I cry.

575
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:53,470
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all.

576
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,830
You make me rise when I fall.

577
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,650
Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling.

578
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,730
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.

579
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,470
Can't you hear my heartbeat fast?

580
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,150
I want this to last.

581
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,530
Need you by my side.

582
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:17,050
Cause every time we touch, I feel the static.

583
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,230
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky.

584
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,830
Can't you hear my heartbeat so?

585
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,530
I can't let you go.

586
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,190
Want you in my life.

587
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:29,790
I

588
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,560
was like half chewing my food while singing that.

589
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,500
Every

590
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,760
time we kiss, I swear I could fly.

591
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,020
Yeah!

592
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,440
That was every time we touch.

593
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,280
Oh my gosh, I wonder if there's any erotic on here.

594
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,140
No, there's not.

595
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,460
How sad.

596
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,880
Anything, anything by Dramarama, onegai shimasu.

597
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,960
Anything, anything.

598
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,660
Mamma mia.

599
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,460
Mamma mia.

600
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,820
Hold on, let me do... Captain Jack!

601
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:40,720
Yo!

602
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,940
I wonder if that's on here.

603
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,880
Hold on, I'll write it down.

604
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,280
Captain Jack.

605
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,880
What was that?

606
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,200
Anything, anything.

607
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,650
Okay, let me check Captain Jack.

608
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,210
I will do Boa, don't worry.

609
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,430
I will.

610
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,850
Ayo, Captain Jack!

611
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,450
Ayo, Captain Jack!

612
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,750
What was the song?

613
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:13,470
There was one song in DDR by Captain Jack I used to do all the time.

614
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,670
I wonder... what's this one?

615
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,350
Oh, thank you for... thank you, Cheliax.

616
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,310
Ayo, Captain Jack!

617
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,810
Ayo, Captain Jack!

618
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,430
Bring me back to the railroad track!

619
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,050
Bring me back to the railroad track!

620
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,290
Into the railroad track!

621
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,850
Run along with Captain Jack!

622
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,570
I don't remember this song at all.

623
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,030
Oh, shit.

624
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,870
Run... Yes!

625
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:38,650
Dream a dream!

626
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,090
Oh my gosh, how'd you know?

627
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,710
Oh my god, that's the song I used to do all the time!

628
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,710
Left, right, right, left.

629
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,690
Run along with Captain Jack.

630
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,450
I don't know this song at all.

631
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,130
I wonder if they have dream a dream.

632
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,210
Dream a dream.

633
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,480
Ayo, Captain Jack!

634
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:10,480
Ayo, Captain Jack!

635
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,280
Ayo, Captain Jack!

636
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,900
Bring me back to the railroad track!

Give me a gun in my hand!

640
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,300
I wanna be a shooting man!

641
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,860
I wanna be a shooting man!

642
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,080
Left, right, left.

643
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
Left, right, left.

644
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,260
The military step.

645
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,820
The military step.

646
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,520
The Air Force rep.

647
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,140
The Air Force rep.

648
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,820
The 17 is the best.

649
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,140

650
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,500

654
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,300
We are running to the railroad...

655
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,200
What is this song?

656
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,440
Company attention!

657
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,420

658
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,150

00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,570
Right, right, left.

697
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,670
I never knew that it cussed in that song.

698
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,630
I never even knew!

699
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,410
I like the other one.

700
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,130
What was it?

701
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:47,410
Anything?

00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,590
Men Phantom Reel.

703
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,110
Let's see.

704
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,930
Someone was watching the panel today.

705
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:58,810
Thank you.

706
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:00,530
Let's see.

707
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,910
I don't know if they have it.

708
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:04,810
Let's see.

709
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,350
What's the Mamma Mia song they have?

710
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,130
Mamma Mia.

711
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:09,930
Cotton Eye Joe?

712
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,210
What is this?

713
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,990
What is this theme all of a sudden?

714
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,530
Please Cotton Eye Joe.

715
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:19,810
Okay.

00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:20,610
Cotton Eye Joe.

717
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,110
Why?

718
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,790
This is the worst karaoke ever.

719
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,190
And then I'll do good songs later.

720
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,170
Well, these are good songs.

721
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:27,510
Wait.

722
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,730

724
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:30,750
No way.

725
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,610
No way that's the name of the group.

726
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:35,050
Rednecks.

727
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:37,650
With an X.

728
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:41,570
If I am being for Cotton Eye Joe, I've been married a long time ago.

729

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,780
If I am being for Cotton Eye Joe.

739
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,240
If

740
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:36,340
I am being for Cotton Eye Joe.

741
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,460
There's more to this song?

742
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:47,210
I've been married a long time ago.

743
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,350
This is the only part of the song I know.

744
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,290
Where did you come from?

745
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:50,930
Cotton Eye Joe.

746
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,850
If I am being for Cotton Eye Joe, I

747
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,060
am.

748
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,120
Where did you come from?

749
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:32,720
Where did you go?

750
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,840
Where did you come from?

751
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,560
Cotton Eye Joe.

752
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:38,760
I was Cotton Eye Joe.

753
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,960
Maybe I should focus on myself.

754
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,780
Maybe I have a bad personality.

755
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,040
Hey!

756
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:43,480
Hey!

757
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,550
Hey!

758
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:33,510
Hey!

759
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:33,910
Hey!

760
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,230
Hey!

761
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:34,330
Hey!

762
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,330
Even I've been for Cotton Eye Joe, I've been married a long time ago.

763
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,440
Bobbi girl!

764
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,280
This one is for you M.O.D.

765
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,820
Thanks for the gift that you guys!

766
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,280
Thank-You!

767
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,240
Wait!

768
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,300
Here we go.

769
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,320
Hi Bobbi.

770
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,060
Hi Ken.

771
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,620
You wanna go for a ride?

772
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,400
Sure Ken.

773
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,480
Jump in.

774
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,620
I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world.

775
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,900
Life in plastic, it's fantastic.

776
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,460
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere.

777
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,460
Imagination, life is your creation.

778
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,700
Come on Barbie, let's go party!

779
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,100

Imagination, life is your creation.

783
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,280
I'm a blonde bimbo girl, in a fantasy world.

784
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,560
Dress me up, make it tight, I'm your dolly.

785
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,840
You're my doll, rock and roll, feel the glamour and bing.

786
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,940
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky.

787
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,860
You can touch, you can play, if you say, I'm always yours.

788
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,720
I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world.

789
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,740

792
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,600
It's fantastic.

793
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,260
It's fantastic.

794
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,920
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere.

795
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,900
Imagination, life is your creation.

796
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,300
Come on Barbie, let's go potty.

797
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,740
Ah, ah, ah, yeah.

798
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,980

Make me walk, make me talk, do whatever you please.

805
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,580
I can act like a star, I can beg on my knees.

806
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,060
Come jump in, bimbo friend, let us do it again.

807
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,360
Hit the town, fool around, let's go potty.

808
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:15,500
You can touch, you can play, if you say it's yours.

809
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:22,800
You can touch, you can play, if you say I'm always yours.

810
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,480

816
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,500
Come on Barbie, let's go potty.

00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,760
Ooh, ooh.

818
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,140
In

819
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,970

820
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,590

Ooh, ooh.

834
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:26,110
Oh, I'm having so much fun, Ken.

835
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:26,270
Come on Barbie, let's go potty.

836
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:26,270
Oh, I'm having so much fun, Ken.

837
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:28,870
Well, Barbie, we're just getting started.

838
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:29,450
Well, Barbie, we're just getting started.

839
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,530
Oh, I love you, Ken.

840
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:31,730
Oh, I love you, Ken.

841
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,870
Sorry to any Kens in the chat.

842
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,050
That song makes me want to act.

843
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:41,650
That song makes me want to be Barbie.

844
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:47,670
Yay!

845
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,530
Superstar Misa.

846
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:50,650
She's my wife.

847
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:51,150
She's my wife.

848
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:51,810
Wait, did it have that?

849
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,190
Oh my God, thank you for the Aka-Soufa.

850
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,090
Love Fool by the Thug.

851
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:56,650
The cardigans.

852
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,290
Love it, you're singing too.

853
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:58,910
Love fool.

854
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,130
Let me look it up.

855
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:05,290
Also, whoever requested anything earlier, I couldn't find it.

856
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:05,670
I'm sorry.

857
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,610
She's my wife.

858
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:13,170
She is my wife.

859
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,710
This is the acapella version.

860
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:21,730
No boa duvet.

861
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:24,190
I'm saving some of the slower songs for later.

862
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:25,370
Later.

863
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:27,890
Right now it's kind of like all the funky fun songs.

864
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:30,650
And then we'll do like the slower like...

865
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:34,170
So if you have a slower song... I have it written down.

866
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,470
I'm gonna... dancing queen!

867
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:37,030
Yeah.

868
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:38,710
Let me look up love fool real quick.

869
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:39,710
See if I know it or not.

870
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:41,090
Love fool.

871
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,330
No, I don't even see it on here.

872
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:46,310
Oh, wait.

873
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:55,470
Let me see if I can find a karaoke on YouTube.

874
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:58,670
I don't even know if she's my wife would have a karaoke.

875
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,710
If you search up Dazuhiro on your art tag, there's a microphone for your first anniversary.

876
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:08,030
Really?

877
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:09,390
Thank you!

878
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:10,350
Oh my gosh.

879
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:11,510
Wait, I'll use it.

880
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:12,470
I'll use it next time.

881
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:14,590
Let me write it down though.

882
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:15,710
Dazuhiro.

883
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:16,750
Thanks Dazuhiro!

884
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:22,210
I like how you're like, if you search up Dazuhiro as if I don't know your name.

885
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:23,130
Mike.

886
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:24,250
On Twitter.

887
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:26,530
I know you.

888
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:30,910
Hercules tsundere song.

889
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:31,390
Okay.

890
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:33,130
You know me.

891
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:33,830
I'll always do.

892
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:34,690
I'll always do.

893
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:39,630
I'll always do some nice... some Disney.

894
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:43,030
7192!

895
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,730
Thank you so much for the ride!

896
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:45,930
Thank you, thank you!

897
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,930
Thank you so much!

898
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:49,210
Thank you, thank you!

899
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,490
Hope you had a fun stream.

900
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:52,770
Dreams by Fleetwood Mac.

901
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,570
Don't stop me now!

902
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:55,810
Oh my gosh.

903
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:56,750
I can't sing that song.

904
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:58,910
Elizabeth sang that song way too well.

905
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,510
She sang that song like she was the queen!

906
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,550
I can't stop listening to her singing that.

907
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,650
It's so good!

908
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:11,090
It's so good!

909
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:13,370
Oh my gosh.

910
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:13,970
She...

911
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,450
I can listen.

912
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:18,430
I love how she had like her karaoke like...

913
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:21,030
It was going on for like 10 hours today.

914
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:21,610
It was crazy.

915
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:23,830
Like all her unarchived stuff.

916
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:25,250
I was watching it earlier.

917
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,550
What was I searching?

918
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:28,570
Oh, Love Fool.

919
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,050
By Cardigans.

920
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:34,300
Karaoke?

921
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,080
Let me see.

922
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,080
Hold on.

923
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,160
Let me see if I know this first.

924
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,930
Mmm-mmm.

925
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:46,150
Oh!

926
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:52,670
I fear we're facing a problem.

927
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,390
You love me.

928
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,110
No longer I know it.

929
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:05,770
Maybe there is nothing that I can do to make you do all I can.

930
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:12,550
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother that I ought just to stay.

931
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:22,350
I don't know this song very well.

932
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:26,710
So I cry and I pray and I beg.

933
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,970
Love me, love me.

934
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,370
Say that you love me.

935
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,270
Fool me, fool me.

936
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:35,670
Go on and fool me.

937
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:37,510
Love me, love me.

938
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:39,850
Pretend that you love me.

939
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,810
Leave me, leave me.

940
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:44,210
Just say that you need me.

941
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:54,710
So I cry and I beg for you to love me, love me.

942
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:57,050
Say that you love me.

943
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,950
Leave me, leave me.

944
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,370
Just say that you need me.

945
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:06,390
I can't care about anything but you.

946
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:14,330
I have desperately pondered.

947
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:25,470
Spent my nights awake and I wonder what I could have done in another way to make you stay.

948
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:30,790
Reason will not lead to solution.

949
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:35,110
I will end up lost in confusion.

950
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,550
I don't care...

951
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:40,070
Oh my gosh, I've been forgetting to update the setlist for so long.

952
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:40,910
I'm so sorry.

953
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:42,350
Haha.

954
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:42,950
Go.

955
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:48,030
So I cry and I pray and I beg.

956
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:50,390
Love me, love me.

957
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:52,790
Say that you love me.

958
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:54,710
Fool me, fool me.

959
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:57,110
Go on and fool me.

960
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,990
Love me, love me.

961
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:01,350
Pretend that you love me.

962
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,250
Leave me, leave me.

963
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,670
Just say that you need me.

964
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:11,290
So I cry and I beg for you to love me, love me.

965
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,550
Say that you love me.

966
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,390
Leave me, leave me.

967
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:22,770
Just say that you need me.

968
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:27,830
I can't care about anything but you.

969
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:32,270
Anything but you.

970
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:37,530
Love me, love me.

971
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,990
Say that you love me.

972
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:41,270
Fool me, fool me.

973
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:44,250
Go on and fool me.

974
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,090
Love me, love me.

975
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:48,710
I know that you need me.

976
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:53,610
I can't care about anything but you.

977
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:57,050
Sorry, Oimo.

978
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,590
I think I butchered your song.

979
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:05,030
Okay, I will remember to update the setlist now.

980
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,830
Or not setlist, but the now playing.

981
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:12,470
I think on a vertical format, having a setlist is hard.

982
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:13,510
Oh, sorry, my bad.

983
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:17,130
Go to bed when you need to.

984
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:18,690
Asian Kung Fu Generation rewrite.

985
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:21,450
I love that song.

986
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,190
I'm parasocial.

987
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:27,530
Dreams, dreams from nights.

988
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:29,370
I don't know that one.

989
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,150
I believe in a thing called love by the darkness.

990
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,470
Wait, do I know that one?

991
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:38,110
Oh my gosh.

992
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,130
You guys suggest so many songs.

993
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:41,530
I'm sorry if I can't get to everything.

994
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:42,870
Tattoo!

995
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:44,070
Okay.

996
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:48,910
I think I can sing Tattoo.

997
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,710
They're not gonna get us.

998
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,690
Wait, I don't know if I remember this song.

999
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:55,370
I'll try it.

1000
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:11,010
Get us.

1001
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,690
They're not gonna get us.

1002
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,410
Not gonna get us.

1003
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,210
They're not gonna get us.

1004
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,850
Not gonna get us.

1005
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,450
Starting from here.

1006
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:27,350
Let's make a promise.

1007
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,010
You and me.

1008
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,030
Let's just be honest.

1009
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:32,770
We're gonna run.

1010
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,870
Nothing can stop us.

1011
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:38,730
Even the night that falls all around us.

1012
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:42,030
Soon there will be laughter and voices.

1013
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:44,030
Beyond the clouds.

1014
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:45,770
Over the mountains.

1015
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,890
I don't know if I'm getting the keys right at all.

1016
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:49,430
That are empty.

1017
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:51,470
Lights from the airfield.

1018
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:53,350
Shining above you.

1019
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:55,330
Nothing can stop us.

1020
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:56,910
No, no, I love you.

1021
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:58,890
They're not gonna get us.

1022
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:01,820
They're not gonna get us.

1023
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,420
Nothing can stop us.

1024
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,340
No, no, I love you.

1025
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,300
They're not gonna get us.

1026
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,120
They're not gonna get us.

1027
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,620
They're not gonna get us.

1028
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,800
Get

1029
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,460
us!

1030
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:42,420
Uh oh!

1031
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,300
I think I'm getting the rides wrong.

1032
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,900
Not gonna haunt us!

1033
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:50,680
We

1034
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,220
rush ahead.

1035
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,240
The crossroads are empty.

1036
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,040
Our spirits rise.

1037
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,160
They're not gonna get us.

1038
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,340
Always forever.

1039
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,360
Just you and me.

1040
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,320
All else is nothing.

1041
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,100
Not going back.

1042
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,140
Not going back there.

1043
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,680
They don't understand.

1044
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,460
They don't understand us.

1045
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,340
Not gonna get us.

1046
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,620
Not gonna get us.

1047
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,120
Not gonna get us.

1048
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,320
Nothing can stop us.

1049
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,120
No, no, I love you.

1050
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,760
They're not gonna get us.

1051
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,880
They're not gonna get us.

1052
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,700
Nothing can stop us.

1053
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,440
No, no, I love you.

1054
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,360
They're not gonna get us.

1055
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,220
They're not gonna get us.

1056
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,740
They're not gonna get us.

1057
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,940
They're not gonna get us.

1058
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,900
Not gonna get us.

1059
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:17,680
Not gonna get us.

1060
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,260
They're not gonna get us.

1061
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,160
They're not gonna get us.

1062
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,000
Not gonna get us.

1063
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:33,680
Not gonna get us.

1064
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:33,840
Not gonna get us.

1065
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:34,760
Not gonna get us.

1066
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:38,020
Wow, I haven't heard that song in probably like 10 years.

1067
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:38,620
That's crazy.

1068
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:45,200
I don't know if I got the keys or the verses right at all.

1069
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,860
Why does the background vocals sound like Spongebob singing?

1070
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,440
Someone suggested this earlier.

1071
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,500
I'll do my best with it, but...

1072
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:59,980
Don't compare me to a certain...

1073
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,540
You know... singer.

1074
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,660
I'm not a singer.

1075
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,740
I'll take lessons.

1076
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:12,820
I'll take lessons someday.

1077
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,060
I'm inside out.

1078
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:39,040
I'm floating around in ecstasy.

1079
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,000
So don't stop me now.

1080
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,120
Don't stop me cause I'm having a good time.

1081
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,820
I'm shooting a star leaping through the sky.

1082
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,700
Like a tiger, defying the laws of gravity.

1083
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,340
I'm racing a car passing by.

1084
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:01,920
It's a good time.

1085
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:04,220
Gotta go, go, go.

1086
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,260
There's no stopping me.

1087
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,680
I'm burning through the sky.

1088
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:13,560
200 degrees, that's why I call me Mr. Fahrenheit.

1089
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:17,240
I'm traveling at the speed of light.

1090
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,080
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you.

1091
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,200
Don't stop me now.

1092
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,520
I'm having such a good time.

1093
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,100
I'm having a ball.

1094
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,560
Don't stop me now.

1095
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,520
If you don't wanna have a good time.

1096
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,920
Wait, wait, if you don't wanna have a good time.

1097
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,360
Don't stop me now.

1098
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,760
Cause I'm having a good time.

1099
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,320
Don't stop me now.

1100
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,700
Yes, I'm having a good time.

1101
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,880
Don't wanna stop at all.

1102
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:45,460
I'm a rocket ship.

1103
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:46,620
I'm with my boys.

1104
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,400
On a collision course.

1105
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,700
I'm a satellite.

1106
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,560
I'm out of control.

1107
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:52,960
I'm a sex machine.

1108
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,080
Ready to reload.

1109
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,040
Like an atom bomb.

1110
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,520
Bout to oh, oh, oh, oh.

1111
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,040
I'll explode.

1112
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:00,280
I'll explode.

1113
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,140
I'm burning through the sky.

1114
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:03,820
Oh yeah.

1115
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,400
200 degrees.

1116
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,480
It's all my cousin.

1117
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,080
I wanna make a supersonic woman out of you.

1118
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,100
Oh, why did I even attempt this song?

1119
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,400
Don't stop me.

1120
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:18,220
Don't stop me.

1121
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:18,980
Don't stop me.

1122
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:19,600
No, stop this song.

1123
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,540
Don't stop me.

1124
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:21,320
Don't stop me.

1125
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,120
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1126
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,600
Don't stop me.

1127
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:24,420
Don't stop me.

1128
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,300
Don't stop me.

1129
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,220
Good times.

1130
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:26,720
Don't stop me.

1131
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,740
I don't even know how to stop.

1132
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:28,560
No

1133
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:33,930
stopping.

1134
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:34,230
Don't stop me.

1135
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,450
Don't stop

1136
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:48,270
me.

1137
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:48,790
Don't stop me.

1138
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:48,850
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1139
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:50,050
200 degrees.

1140
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:52,090
That's why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit.

1141
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,710
I'm travelling at the speed of light.

1142
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:58,530
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you.

1143
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,710
Don't stop me now.

1144
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,870
I'm having such a good time.

1145
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:05,550
I'm having a ball.

1146
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:08,010
Don't stop me now.

1147
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:10,010
I'm gonna have a good time.

1148
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:11,750
Just give me a call.

1149
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:13,830
Don't stop me now.

1150
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,090
Let's have a good time.

1151
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:16,650
Don't stop me.

1152
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:17,790
Yes, I'm having a goo...

1153
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:24,160
Tararino.

1154
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:39,350
Oh, that's the rest?

1155
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:40,990
Wait, I thought it went to the rest.

1156
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:47,450
Oh my god.

1157
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,630
Sorry, I've totally butchered that.

1158
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:51,110
It's fine.

1159
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:53,890
The coffee is starting to weigh down actually.

1160
01:05:54,210 --> 01:06:01,070
That's why I'm like trying to eat because I was like, oh gosh, the caffeine is like passing through me and now I need food because I'm starting to shake.

1161
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:03,730
Mamma mia time.

1162
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:04,550
Okay.

1163
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:06,890
You're a pretty good singer.

1164
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:08,290
I'm not, but thank you.

1165
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:12,150
I'm not, but thanks.

1166
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:13,130
I appreciate it.

1167
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:14,730
Mamma mia.

1168
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,810
What's a song from Mamma Mia?

1169
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:17,170
Oh my gosh.

1170
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,530
Thank you for the 50 gift.

1171
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:21,490
And I think I, oh sorry.

1172
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,230
I think I saw Paco right in me.

1173
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:24,490
I think it was you, Paco.

1174
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:25,110
Thank you.

1175
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:26,710
If you're still here.

1176
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:28,210
Hello, I'm in Phantom.

1177
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:29,410
Anybody who doesn't know.

1178
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:31,970
Let's do Abba.

1179
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:33,070
Abba Abba.

1180
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:36,150
It'll be in my heart.

1181
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:36,570
Oh my god.

1182
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:36,750
None.

1183
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:39,370
It's like the one Disney song.

1184
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:40,090
I don't know.

1185
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:51,780
Holy moly.

1186
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:52,500
That scared me.

1187
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,960
You can dance.

1188
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:12,500
You can jive.

1189
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:13,920
Have you

1190
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,360
seen that girl?

1191
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,600
Watch that scene.

1192
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:23,980
Dig in the dancing queen.

1193
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,580
Friday night and the lights are low.

1194
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,200
Looking out for a place to go.

1195
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,620
Where they play the right music.

1196
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,380
Getting in swing.

1197
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,100
You gotta look for a king.

1198
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,820
Anybody could be that guy.

1199
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,740
The night is young and the music solved.

1200
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:04,500
Hi, with a bit of rock music, everything is fine.

1201
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:07,720
You're in the mood for a dance.

1202
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:16,440
And when you get the chance, you are the dancing queen.

1203
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,600
Young and sweet, forever 19.

1204
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:32,200
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah.

1205
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:39,260
You can dance, you can jive, and

1206
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:49,830
we'll see that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen.

1207
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:54,710
Watch

1208
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:01,770
that stream.

1209
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:05,370
You're a teaser, you turn him on.

1210
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:10,370
Leave him burning and then you're gone.

1211
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:18,370
You're in the mood for a dance.

1212
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:27,860
And when you get the chance, you are the dancing queen.

1213
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:32,100
Young and sweet, forever 19.

1214
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:43,560
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah.

1215
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:50,520
You can dance, you can jive, and

1216
01:09:54,190 --> 01:10:01,110
we'll see that girl, watch that scene, dig in the freaky queen.

1217
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:39,810
Nice.

1218
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:42,710
Nice, nice, nice.

1219
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:44,990
That was the dancing queen.

1220
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:47,690
Young and sweet.

1221
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,030
Hopefully that suffices for Mamma Mia.

1222
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:55,210
Because I don't know, actually I only know, Mamma Mia, here I go again.

1223
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:57,950
A bunch of us are at Anime Fest learning what to get to the stream.

1224
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:00,430
Is Kenjo teaching you guys?

1225
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:05,350
Nice.

1226
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:09,750
Thanks for watching, even at Anime Fest.

1227
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:11,590
Take on me!

1228
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:18,950
Sometimes I only recommend songs that I know, and it's hard to tell which songs you're familiar with.

1229
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:19,930
No, it's okay!

1230
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:23,130
Always feel free, like you can suggest a song.

1231
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:28,910
Just because I don't know it, doesn't mean I won't be able to sing it in the future.

1232
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:30,390
Sung Bohemian Rhapsody?

1233
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:30,970
I haven't.

1234
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:31,870
Should I sing it?

1235
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,470
I'll do it after this one.

1236
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:34,530
Take on me.

1237
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:38,330
Bohemian Rhapsody.

1238
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:38,590
Bohemian Rhapsody.

1239
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:41,370
Gosh, I need to warm up my voice.

1240
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,970
I mean, I have, like, been singing, but it's like...

1241
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,710
And I never do, like, vocal warm-ups.

1242
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:50,310
I just kind of was like, I'm just gonna go in for this, baby.

1243
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,100
We're talking away.

1244
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,120
I don't know what I'm to say.

1245
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,700
I'll say it anyway.

1246
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:38,160
Today's another day to find you.

1247
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,640
Shying away.

1248
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,420
I'll be coming for you, love, okay.

1249
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,960
Take on me.

1250
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,500
Take me on.

1251
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:53,180
So

1252
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,880
needless to say.

1253
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,860
I'm at odds and ends.

1254
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,600
But I'll be stumbling away.

1255
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,700
Slowly learning that life is okay.

1256
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,400
Say after me.

1257
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,800
It's either too low or too high.

1258
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,360
It's no better to be safe than sorry.

1259
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:26,660
Take on me.

1260
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:28,360
How do I do this part?

1261
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,320
Take on me.

1262
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,260
Take me on.

1263
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:34,860
Take on me.

1264
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,900
Help me God.

1265
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,160
In a day or two.

1266
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:42,980
My

1267
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,700
warm -ups.

1268
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,160
For

1269
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,360
me.

1270
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:21,350
I was practicing the higher one.

1271
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:21,570
They were boring.

1272
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:22,790
I don't even know the notes.

1273
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:23,990
This is Piquan approaching.

1274
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,490
All the things that you say.

1275
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:32,910
Is it life or just to play my worries away?

1276
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:36,830
You're all the things I've got to remember.

1277
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:38,750
You shying away.

1278
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:41,990
I'll be coming for you anyway.

1279
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:46,090
Take on me.

1280
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:48,550
Take on me.

1281
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:49,530
Take me.

1282
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:50,950
Take me on.

1283
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:57,540
I'll be gone.

1284
01:14:58,220 --> 01:14:59,840
In a day or.

1285
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,720
Take me on.

1286
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:14,300
I'll be gone.

1287
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,060
In a day.

1288
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,000
Take me on.

1289
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,600
Take on me.

1290
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,000
Where's the two?

1291
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:28,200
Take on me.

1292
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,380
Take me on.

1293
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,860
Take on me.

1294
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,960
Take on me.

1295
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,620
Take on me.

1296
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,500
Ha!

1297
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,580
That part confused the hell out of me.

1298
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,380
Oh, that was take on me.

1299
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:47,660
My god.

1300
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,460
You guys, why do I even sing?

1301
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,520
Why do I even sing?

1302
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:57,060
Why are you guys even listening to me?

1303
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,460
Got another suggestion.

1304
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:02,900
Scatman?

1305
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:03,760
Oh my gosh, wait!

1306
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,100
I did Scatman earlier!

1307
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,640
I did, I did, I did, I did Scatman.

1308
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,480
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it.

1309
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:12,620
Okay, I'm gonna do a song.

1310
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:14,200
Maybe that actually... Okay, hold on.

1311
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:14,720
Okay.

1312
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,480
Serious time.

1313
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,960
This song goes through my entire rage.

1314
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,460
Kenji's freaking out.

1315
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,520
What's the song in Yota G2?

1316
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,080
Heavens divide.

1317
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:35,860
Living la vida loca?

1318
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:36,360
Okay.

1319
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,740
How do you know that song?

1320
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:43,940
My god, Ricky Martin.

1321
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,520
I used to have such a crush on that guy.

1322
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,060
So did my grandma.

1323
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:49,720
I think I...

1324
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:57,460
Oh, it's a trick!

1325
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,160
That's right!

1326
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,860
She's into superstitions.

1327
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:05,340
Black cats and voodoo dolls.

1328
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:08,160
I feel a premonition.

1329
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,760
That girl's gonna make me fall.

1330
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,260
She's into sensations.

1331
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:21,460
New kicks in the candlelight.

1332
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,200
She's got a new addiction.

1333
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,940
For every day and night.

1334
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,240
She'll make you take your clothes off.

1335
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,500
And go dancing in the rain.

1336
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:34,900
She'll make you live her crazy life.

1337
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,020
But she'll take away your pain.

1338
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,700
Like a bullet to your brain.

1339
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:40,360
Come on!

1340
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,160
Upside, inside, out.

1341
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:45,140
Living la vida loca.

1342
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,490
She'll push and pull you down.

1343
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,620
Living la vida loca.

1344
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:54,020
Her lips are devil rings.

1345
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:56,120
And her skin is the color of mocha.

1346
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:59,420
She will wear you out.

1347
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,400
Living la vida loca.

1348
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,080
Living la vida loca.

1349
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,840
She's living la vida loca.

1350
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,820
Woke up in New York City.

1351
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,320
In a funky cheap hotel.

1352
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,260
She took my heart.

1353
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,380
She took my money.

1354
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,920
She must have slipped me a sleeping pill.

1355
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:29,280
What?

1356
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:31,200
She never drinks the water.

1357
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,520
Makes you order French champagne.

1358
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,980
Once you've had a taste of her.

1359
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,160
You'll never be the same.

1360
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:41,700
Yeah, she'll make you go insane.

1361
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:42,500
Come on!

1362
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,340
Upside, inside, out.

1363
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,280
She's living la vida loca.

1364
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:50,720
She'll push and pull you down.

1365
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,780
Living la vida loca.

1366
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,960
Her lips are devil rings.

1367
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,220
And her skin is the color of mocha.

1368
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:01,580
She will wear you out.

1369
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:03,540
Living la vida loca.

1370
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:06,220
Living la vida loca.

1371
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,960
She's living la vida loca.

1372
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:14,920
She'll

1373
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,640
make you take your clothes off.

1374
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,960
And go dancing in the rain.

1375
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:28,360
She'll make you live her crazy life.

1376
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,420
But she'll take away your pain.

1377
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,160
Like a bullet to your brain.

1378
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:33,920
Come on!

1379
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,660
Upside, inside, out.

1380
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,440
Vida loca.

1381
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:42,140
She'll push and pull you down.

1382
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:43,940
Living la vida loca.

1383
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:47,400
Her lips are devil red.

1384
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,500
And her skin's the color of mocha.

1385
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:52,940
She will wear you out.

1386
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,780
Living la vida loca.

1387
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:58,280
Upside, inside, out.

1388
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,200
She's living la vida loca.

1389
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,800
What is this part?

1390
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:25,260
Come on!

1391
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:26,920
Come on!

1392
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:27,700
What is this part?

1393
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:54,490
I never knew what the lyrics of that song were.

1394
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:58,030
Oh my god.

1395
01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:05,870
He literally was just like, she made me... or she drugged me in the night and she took my money.

1396
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:12,510
She gave me a sleeping pill and she took my money.

1397
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:15,190
I'll never financially recover.

1398
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:16,870
Oh my god.

1399
01:21:16,890 --> 01:21:17,450
Oh my god.

1400
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:20,250
I'm kinda into it.

1401
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:21,370
You're freaky.

1402
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:24,050
Shadowcross, thank you for the tiny gift then.

1403
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:25,210
Popipo.

1404
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:27,130
You're a stupid.

1405
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:32,510
Tiny princess, thank you.

1406
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:35,430
Bro got scammed.

1407
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:37,890
Okay,

1408
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:52,720
it might be time to start chilling out.

1409
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,600
It's starting to get late in the night.

1410
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,400
Bohemian Rhapsody.

1411
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:05,610
I can do Bohemian Rhapsody.

1412
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,460
What is the edit?

1413
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:15,140
Holden... what's that?

1414
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,660
Is that the... Holden out for... wait.

1415
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:17,720
Holden out for a hero.

1416
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:19,820
I don't know that.

1417
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:20,040
Wait.

1418
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,520
I know that one but I don't know that one.

1419
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:26,080
Is this the real life?

1420
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,060
Is this just fantasy?

1421
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:33,120
Caught in a landslide.

1422
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,160
No escape from reality.

1423
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:40,140
Open your eyes.

1424
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:45,060
Look up to the skies and see.

1425
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,960
I'm just a poor ghost.

1426
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:54,000
I need no sympathy.

1427
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:57,940
Cause I'm easy come, easy go.

1428
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:01,400
Little high, little low.

1429
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:04,700
Any way the wind blows.

1430
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,860
Doesn't really matter to me.

1431
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,140
To me.

1432
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,200
Mama.

1433
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,260
Just killed a man.

1434
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:27,420
Put a gun against his head.

1435
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,500
Pulled my trigger.

1436
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,980
Now he's dead.

1437
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:32,720
Mama.

1438
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:36,900
Life had just begun.

1439
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:43,380
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.

1440
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,360
Mama.

1441
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,780
Didn't mean to make you cry.

1442
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:59,600
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow.

1443
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,780
Carry on.

1444
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:03,320
Carry on.

1445
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,400
As if nothing really matters.

1446
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:18,760
Too late.

1447
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:22,720
My time has come.

1448
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:26,700
Sent shivers down my spine.

1449
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:30,120
Body's aching all the time.

1450
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:33,500
Goodbye everybody.

1451
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,220
I've got to go.

1452
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:40,240
Gotta leave you all behind.

1453
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,700
And face the truth.

1454
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:45,660
Mama.

1455
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:53,780
I don't wanna die.

1456
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,020
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

1457
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:03,920
Today.

1458
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:14,320
Oh seven.

1459
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:31,830
I see a little silhetto of man.

1460
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:35,630
Scaramouche, Scaramouche will you do the fantastico.

1461
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:39,210
Thunderbolts of lightning very, very frightening me.

1462
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:40,350
Galileo.

1463
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:44,870
Galileo, Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnificao.

1464
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:49,030
I'm just a poor ghost, nobody loves me.

1465
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:51,990
He's just a poor boy from a poor family.

1466
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:54,850
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.

1467
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:59,950
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?

1468
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:00,750
Bismillah!

1469
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:01,390
No!

1470
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:03,010
We will not let you go!

1471
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:03,610
Let him go!

1472
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:04,870
Bismillah!

1473
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:06,270
We will not let you go!

1474
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:07,910
Bismillah!

1475
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:09,490
We will not let you go!

1476
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:11,090
We will not let you go!

1477
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:12,550
Never let you go!

1478
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:13,430
Never let me go!

1479
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:14,650
No!

1480
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:15,270
No!

1481
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:15,790
No!

1482
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:16,210
No!

1483
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:16,590
No!

1484
01:26:16,590 --> 01:26:16,990
No!

1485
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:17,230
No!

1486
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:18,130
Mamma mia!

1487
01:26:18,230 --> 01:26:18,930
Mamma mia!

1488
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:19,750
Mamma mia!

1489
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:20,410
Let me go!

1490
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:24,490
Me as a pup, as a devil put aside for me!

1491
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:26,430
For me!

1492
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:27,890
For me!

1493
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:30,750
Yeah!

1494
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:33,370
So

1495
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:42,000
you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?

1496
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:47,200
So you think you can love me and leave me?

1497
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,220
To die?

1498
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:51,660
Oh baby!

1499
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:55,040
Can't do this to me baby!

1500
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,480
Just gotta get out!

1501
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,080
Just gotta get right outta here!

1502
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:37,010
Nothing really matters.

1503
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:40,590
Anyone can see.

1504
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:43,710
Nothing really matters.

1505
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:50,430
Nothing really matters to me.

1506
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,370
Except Metal Gear.

1507
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:09,320
Anyway the wind blows.

1508
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:16,720
Bohemian Rhapsody.

1509
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:21,520
Maybe that was a good one to end in the craziness, right?

1510
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:23,920
I don't know.

1511
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:24,780
I might go back to crazy.

1512
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,240
Can we get Mamma Mia?

1513
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:26,720
I don't know!

1514
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:27,360
Mamma Mia!

1515
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:27,880
I'm sorry!

1516
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,040
That's why I sang Dancing Queen.

1517
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:33,060
That's why I sang Viva La Vida.

1518
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:34,560
Oh yeah, that's a good one.

1519
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:39,300
I might have to turn it up though.

1520
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,240
Let me up the pitch.

1521
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:43,560
Elton John.

1522
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,620
I'll put...

1523
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:45,520
Let me do Elton John.

1524
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,680
Actually, I wonder if I can just sing this one.

1525
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:51,220
Okay.

1526
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:52,300
Okay.

1527
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:53,240
Okay.

1528
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:12,020
Let's see if I can do this one.

1529
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:13,900
I don't know.

1530
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,020
I don't think so.

1531
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:15,860
I think it's too high.

1532
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:17,560
I think it's too high.

1533
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:17,980
Hold on.

1534
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:18,700
Let me start over.

1535
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:19,480
I'm gonna...

1536
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:22,140
Do this.

1537
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:22,880
Let me try that.

1538
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:23,620
Let me try one more time.

1539
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:24,880
Okay.

1540
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:48,280
Okay,

1541
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:59,230
I'm gonna do it one more time.

1542
01:29:59,370 --> 01:29:59,550
Okay.

1543
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:01,030
I know it.

1544
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:01,430
I know it now.

1545
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:01,590
Okay.

1546
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:05,210
Are you guys sick of this opening yet?

1547
01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:05,870
Okay, there we go.

1548
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:17,610
I used to rule the world.

1549
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:20,810
Seas would rise when I gave the word.

1550
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:24,190
Now in the morning I sleep alone.

1551
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:28,250
Sweep the streets I used to own.

1552
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:40,060
Again!

1553
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:40,860
I'm back!

1554
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:41,040
Haha!

1555
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:45,460
I used to roll the dice.

1556
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:48,680
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes.

1557
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:52,140
Listen as the crowd would sing.

1558
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:54,680
Now the old king is dead.

1559
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:55,960
Long live the king.

1560
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:59,040
One minute I held the key.

1561
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,440
Next the walls were closed on me.

1562
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:09,900
And I discovered that my castles stand upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand.

1563
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:14,000
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing.

1564
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:17,360
Roman cavalry choirs are singing.

1565
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,860
Be my mirror, my sword, my shield.

1566
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:24,260
My missionaries in a foreign field.

1567
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:27,560
For some reason I can't explain.

1568
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:33,860
Once you go there was never, never an honest word.

1569
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:37,600
That was when I ruled the world.

1570
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,240
What's the meme lyrics?

1571
01:31:50,730 --> 01:32:19,290
It was the wicked and wild wind Blew the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People could not believe what I'd become Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh, who would ever want to be king?

1572
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:47,350
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword, my shield My missionaries in the foreign field For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I Ruled the world

1573
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,600
Saint Mito!

1574
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:56,180
Video

1575
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:45,460
of the king reminiscing That's destroyed Minecraft I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword, my shield My missionaries in the foreign field For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world What's the lyrics?

1576
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,120
What's the Minecraft lyrics?

1577
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:52,940
Minecraft...

1578
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:10,680
Chunks would load when I gave the word Hide the mobs I used to slay No block choirs

1579
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:20,600
It was the creepers and the skeletons Blew down the doors and boxed us in What is this?

1580
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:35,900
This is so stupid I gaze off at the boundless skyline No block choirs playing in the sunshine This is awful Oh my god, it's art Do one verse...

1581
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:42,600
Okay, okay, I'll do it, I'll do it Hold on Minecraft...

1582
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:49,520
Wait, uh, uh, oh, oh Oh wait, no, no, no It's gonna sound really funky Wait for a second Wait

1583
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:56,680
Oh wait, I lost the lyrics Where did they go?

1584
01:34:57,260 --> 01:35:06,380
Oh I love my baby I boobie bop Oh my god Oh hold on, hold on I exited out of the lyrics I'm an idiot Wait, oh

1585
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,280
Oh, okay, hold on Oh, okay, hold on

1586
01:35:15,070 --> 01:35:17,530
Okay, I love BGM while I search for stuff

1587
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:42,880
I used to rule the world Chunks would load when I gave the word Now every night I go stow away Hide from the mobs I used to slay

1588
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:49,280
Yeah, this is so stupid

1589
01:35:55,500 --> 01:36:33,420
They once were terrified Every time I looked into their eyes Villagers would cheer my way For a hero I was That's what they'd say One minute we had it all Next our world began to fall Away from it that it once become They all cried for my help But I stood there numb I'd gaze off into the boundless skyline No block choirs playing in the sunshine Turn around,

1590
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:52,000
pick up my sword and wield The blade that once feared evil Bombs to yield And hope one day that this chaos and Destruction turns for the better Never a bow in hand That was when I ruled the land

1591
01:36:56,280 --> 01:37:31,420
It was the creepers and skeletons Blew down doors and boxed us in Arrows whizzing by like streaks of light I tried all that I could to stay and fight As the undead roamed the street Family's broken at my feet Life itself's just suspended by a thread Oh,

1592
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:33,960
why was it that I wasn't dead?

1593
01:37:34,610 --> 01:38:05,460
I gaze off into the boundless skyline No block wires playing in the sunshine Turn around, pick up my sword and wield The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield If this battle should leave me slain I know Herobrine will call my name Better to take a stand That was when I ruled the land I

1594
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:17,820
gaze off

1595
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:36,220
into the boundless skyline No block wires playing in the sunshine

1596
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:04,880
My crooked glasses just... just bring it all together now, doesn't it?

1597
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:09,040
Oh, there we go.

1598
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,020
Good job, everybody.

1599
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:35,720
Oh, okay, I'm starting to get tired, I'm starting to get tired.

1600
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:38,960
Starting to get tired, I'm starting to get tired.

1601
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:41,160
Let's see what else can... oh no, okay.

1602
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:43,620
Oops.

1603
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:51,940
Now I still have a little bit in me, don't worry.

1604
01:39:56,280 --> 01:40:21,120
And you don't seem to understand A shame you seemed an honest man And all the fears you hold so dear Will turn to whisper in your ear And you know what they say might hurt you And you know that it means so much

1605
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:45,720
I am falling, I am fading, I have lost it all, and you don't seem the lying kind, a shame that I can read your mind.

1606
01:40:47,100 --> 01:41:06,420
And all the things I read, that I read there, candlelit smile that we both share, and you know I don't mean to hurt you, but you know that it means so much, and you don't even feel a thing.

1607
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:15,020
I am falling, I am fading, I am drowning.

1608
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:27,960
Help me to breathe, I am hurting, I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1609
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:38,300
Present day, present time, ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1610
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,520
Help

1611
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:23,640
me to breathe, I am hurting, I am hurting, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1612
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:29,880
I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1613
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:39,980
Help me to

1614
01:43:00,170 --> 01:43:11,010
breathe, I am hurting, I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1615
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:24,650
I have lost it all, I am hurting, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1616
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:27,510
I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1617
01:43:28,650 --> 01:43:28,750
I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1618
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:31,530
I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1619
01:43:31,530 --> 01:43:32,570
I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1620
01:43:32,570 --> 01:43:34,410
I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1621
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:34,470
I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1622
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:34,750
I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1623
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:38,190
I have lost

1624
01:43:41,570 --> 01:43:42,870
it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1625
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:45,070
I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1626
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:47,330
I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1627
01:43:47,970 --> 01:43:49,250
I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe.

1628
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,670
I'm not good at singing karaoke in this style, but you know.

1629
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:04,780
Hold on, I'm looking it up.

1630
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,260
Oh, I remember, I remember.

1631
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:07,820
I remember, I remember.

1632
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:19,880
Karaoke.

1633
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:23,740
Let me check if this is good.

1634
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,040
This song.

1635
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:27,940
I have to use a YouTube one.

1636
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:30,160
It's uploaded 16 years ago.

1637
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,720
You know what, who cares if the quality is bad.

1638
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,020
This was supposed to be a bad quality stream anyway, right?

1639
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:38,320
You're not here to hear me sing well.

1640
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:58,450
Oh, I forgot to look up lyrics.

1641
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:25,910
I'm sorry.

1642
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:44,170
I'm sorry.

1643
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:02,650
I'm sorry.

1644
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:20,330
Yeah.

1645
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1646
01:49:57,380 --> 01:50:00,340
I'm not gonna lie, I started to disassociate during the song.

1647
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:04,660
I started to be like...

1648
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:07,560
I felt like an out of body experience.

1649
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:08,620
I was like, am I...

1650
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:10,140
Am I singing this right now?

1651
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:17,140
Actually, it's so funny because I know that song is from Full Metal Panic.

1652
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:18,300
But...

1653
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:22,700
I actually know that song so well.

1654
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:26,580
I only watched a few episodes of Full Metal Panic because...

1655
01:50:27,380 --> 01:50:29,560
When I was a kid, I owned some of the DVDs.

1656
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:29,700
Right?

1657
01:50:30,980 --> 01:50:32,440
Thank you for the 20 gift!

1658
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:33,100
Thank you!

1659
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:34,500
Panda!

1660
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:35,600
Thank you for the 20 gift!

1661
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:36,220
Thank you!

1662
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:39,880
And...

1663
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:42,660
But actually, I know the song so well.

1664
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:47,180
Because there was a Petite Princesse Uchiha AMV to it.

1665
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:48,760
That was made so well.

1666
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,260
And I fell so much in love with the song.

1667
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:53,620
That I always watched the music.

1668
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:54,440
The AMV.

1669
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:55,980
And also...

1670
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,000
Listen to the song.

1671
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:04,040
Does anybody remember Petite Princesse Uchiha?

1672
01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:05,100
Anyway, I have no idea.

1673
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:10,580
I don't actually remember the songs from that.

1674
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:14,200
I don't remember.

1675
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:15,400
Actually, there was an AMV.

1676
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:16,160
I watched that too.

1677
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:16,740
That was...

1678
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:28,490
Oh my gosh.

1679
01:51:28,970 --> 01:51:29,590
Let's see.

1680
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:32,250
Somebody requested Hercules.

1681
01:51:33,390 --> 01:51:35,070
There was something else I just saw.

1682
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:36,910
And I was like...

1683
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:38,110
Oh, this would be good.

1684
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:39,270
I don't remember.

1685
01:51:39,510 --> 01:51:39,730
Sorry.

1686
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:41,890
Somewhere over the rainbow.

1687
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:43,110
You know what?

1688
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:44,290
Oh!

1689
01:51:44,450 --> 01:51:45,050
I remember.

1690
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:49,520
I wonder...

1691
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,280
Sorry, this is a...

1692
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:53,280
This is a loud song.

1693
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,240
And then I'll go back to the quiet songs.

1694
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:58,880
Kimi ga nozomu eien.

1695
01:51:59,020 --> 01:51:59,280
Sorry!

1696
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:00,040
But...

1697
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:06,460
Ano anime no kyoku wo oboite nai.

1698
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:09,040
Ano anime no kyoku wo oboite nai.

1699
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:12,460
Kimi ga nozomu eien no kyoku ga oboite nai.

1700
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:12,920
Kimi ga nozomu eien no kyoku ga oboite nai.

1701
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:14,520
Opening to ending no kyoku.

1702
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,800
Creep by Radiohead.

1703
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:17,080
Oh!

1704
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,540
I might be able to...

1705
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:20,160
Oh, I don't know.

1706
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:21,160
Can I sing that song?

1707
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,360
Can I try that one next time?

1708
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,240
I actually don't remember it at all.

1709
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:25,920
Well, I do remember it.

1710
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:29,300
But I wanna do it justice.

1711
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:31,040
But I wanna do it justice.

1712
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:31,300
I like that song.

1713
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:35,500
Okay, this one is like from my childhood.

1714
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:37,380
I used to listen to this song all the time.

1715
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:39,380
All the time.

1716
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:41,220
All the time.

1717
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:43,960
I don't even think I'll be able to sing it very well.

1718
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:45,540
But I just kinda wanna sing it.

1719
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:48,060
But I just kinda wanna sing it.

1720
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:49,040
I just kinda wanna sing it.

1721
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:00,340
Broken this fragile thing now.

1722
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:01,020
Broken this fragile thing now.

1723
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:06,360
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces.

1724
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:09,360
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces.

1725
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:12,080
And I've thrown my words all around.

1726
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:13,280
And I've thrown my words all around.

1727
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:14,280
And I've thrown my words all around.

1728
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:18,160
But I can't, I can't give you a reason.

1729
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:21,620
I feel so broken up.

1730
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,600
And I give up.

1731
01:53:24,940 --> 01:53:25,060
And I give up.

1732
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:29,800
I just want to tell you so you know.

1733
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:30,740
I just want to tell you so you know.

1734
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:32,600
Here I go.

1735
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:38,500
Scream my lungs out and try to get to you.

1736
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:42,680
You are my only one.

1737
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:44,480
I let go.

1738
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:50,280
But there's no one who gets me like you do.

1739
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:55,940
You are my only, my only one.

1740
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,580
Oh my gosh, I used to scream this as a kid.

1741
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:05,720
Made my mistakes let you down.

1742
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:11,580
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long.

1743
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:17,420
Ran my whole life in the ground.

1744
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:23,400
And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone.

1745
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:26,740
Somethings breaking up.

1746
01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:29,560
I feel like giving up.

1747
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:34,660
I won't walk out until you know.

1748
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,700
Here I go.

1749
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:43,420
Scream my lungs out and try to get to you.

1750
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:47,720
You are my only one.

1751
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:49,500
I let go.

1752
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,380
There's just no one who gets me like you do.

1753
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:53,380
You are my only one.

1754
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:33,840
I

1755
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:43,100
clearly don't remember this song well enough.

1756
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:07,840
I could have sworn there was a quiet part.

1757
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:09,300
It's a song.

1758
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:10,760
Am I

1759
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:15,840
crazy?

1760
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:18,860
Am I crazy?

1761
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:21,620
I could have sworn there was a part where he was like, here I go.

1762
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:23,720
Maybe they cut the solo out.

1763
01:56:23,860 --> 01:56:24,080
Really?

1764
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:27,180
That's what messed me up so much.

1765
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,640
Anyway, that was yellow card, only one.

1766
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:30,840
Okay, let's sing some Disney.

1767
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:34,500
Disney, Disney, Disney, Disney, Disney, Disney.

1768
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:36,340
What Disney song should I sing?

1769
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:40,380
Disney, Disney.

1770
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:41,400
Oh my gosh, it's easy!

1771
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:43,200
Thank you for the $50 gift and thank you!

1772
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:45,340
Thank you, thank you so much!

1773
01:56:55,800 --> 01:57:02,320
When she loved me... Oh, I sang that in a membership one, I think.

1774
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:07,160
Oh yeah, it's... Okay.

1775
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:08,600
It's quiet, I think.

1776
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:09,140
Quiet hours, everybody.

1777
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:10,500
Quiet hours.

1778
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:13,180
Quiet hours.

1779
01:57:14,940 --> 01:57:15,680
It's late.

1780
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:17,660
It's time for quiet songs.

1781
01:57:25,030 --> 01:57:26,270
Wait, is this the right one?

1782
01:57:26,670 --> 01:57:27,150
No.

1783
01:57:27,950 --> 01:57:28,990
I think it's this one.

1784
01:57:29,090 --> 01:57:29,670
Sorry, my bad.

1785
01:57:31,130 --> 01:57:31,830
My bad.

1786
01:57:32,030 --> 01:57:35,410
We got some dramatic piano for no reason.

1787
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:57,830
When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful.

1788
01:57:58,730 --> 01:58:05,230
Every hour spent together lives within my heart.

1789
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:12,890
And when she was sad, I was there to dry her tears.

1790
01:58:13,230 --> 01:58:18,250
And when she was happy, so was I.

1791
01:58:19,550 --> 01:58:34,570
When she loved me... Through the summer and the fall, we had each other, that was all.

1792
01:58:34,870 --> 01:58:41,430
Just she and I together, like it was meant to be.

1793
01:58:42,890 --> 01:58:49,150
And when she was lonely, I was there to comfort her.

1794
01:58:49,150 --> 01:58:57,790
And I knew that she loved me.

1795
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:11,000
So the years went by, I stayed the same.

1796
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:14,700
But she began to drift away.

1797
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:18,080
I was left alone.

1798
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:32,340
Still I waited for the day, when she'd say I will always love you.

1799
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:41,100
Lonely and forgotten, never thought she'd look my way.

1800
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:48,160
And she smiled at me and held me, just like she used to do.

1801
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:56,520
Like she loved me, when she loved me.

1802
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:04,720
When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful.

1803
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:13,220
Every hour we spent together lives within my heart.

1804
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:20,060
When she loved me...

1805
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:27,680
Oh, sorry, I forgot to change it.

1806
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:34,360
Yay.

1807
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:37,160
I have another one I want to sing, I hope it's okay.

1808
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:41,780
I haven't sung this one in a really long time, so I hope I remember how to sing it.

1809
02:00:53,650 --> 02:00:54,010
Good.

1810
02:00:54,450 --> 02:00:54,810
Good.

1811
02:00:58,810 --> 02:01:01,770
So Jamie, thank you.

1812
02:01:02,970 --> 02:01:05,430
Look at me.

1813
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:13,950
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree.

1814
02:01:15,590 --> 02:01:19,930
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud.

1815
02:01:20,490 --> 02:01:23,510
I can't understand.

1816
02:01:23,510 --> 02:01:26,370
I get misty.

1817
02:01:26,750 --> 02:01:31,070
Just holding your hand.

1818
02:01:33,190 --> 02:01:34,070
My

1819
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:38,160
way.

1820
02:01:39,220 --> 02:01:46,500
And a thousand violins begin to play.

1821
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:52,340
Or it might be the sound of your hello.

1822
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:56,680
That music I hear.

1823
02:01:56,680 --> 02:01:59,200
I get minty.

1824
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:03,000
The moment you're near.

1825
02:02:06,660 --> 02:02:12,960
Can't you see that you're leading me on?

1826
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:20,860
And it's just what I want you to do.

1827
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:25,280
Don't you notice?

1828
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:29,500
How hopelessly I'm lost.

1829
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:37,660
That's why I'm following you on

1830
02:02:42,770 --> 02:02:44,570
my own.

1831
02:02:46,070 --> 02:02:52,630
Would I wander through this wonderland alone?

1832
02:02:54,230 --> 02:02:59,250
Never knowing my right foot from my left.

1833
02:02:59,250 --> 02:03:02,910
My hand from my glove.

1834
02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:05,790
I'm too minty.

1835
02:03:06,810 --> 02:03:11,530
And too much in love.

1836
02:03:17,770 --> 02:03:20,570
Too misty.

1837
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:25,450
And too...

1838
02:03:32,380 --> 02:03:33,260
In love.

1839
02:03:43,810 --> 02:03:44,250
Yay.

1840
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:47,270
That was misty.

1841
02:03:47,390 --> 02:03:49,090
But you could say minty.

1842
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:50,930
Yay.

1843
02:03:51,250 --> 02:03:52,270
Thanks for the claps.

1844
02:03:52,810 --> 02:03:53,950
Clap, clap, clap, clap.

1845
02:03:54,210 --> 02:03:55,670
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

1846
02:03:55,950 --> 02:03:57,170
Clap, clap, clap, clap.

1847
02:03:58,970 --> 02:03:59,850
Thank you.

1848
02:04:00,230 --> 02:04:00,890
Thank you.

1849
02:04:01,250 --> 02:04:01,690
Skyfall.

1850
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:02,490
Oh gosh.

1851
02:04:02,770 --> 02:04:03,850
I don't know if I could sing it tonight.

1852
02:04:03,850 --> 02:04:04,550
Micmac.

1853
02:04:04,650 --> 02:04:05,490
Thanks for the five gifted.

1854
02:04:06,290 --> 02:04:07,310
Making that borderline.

1855
02:04:07,370 --> 02:04:08,170
Maybe another night.

1856
02:04:08,290 --> 02:04:08,870
Maybe another night.

1857
02:04:13,490 --> 02:04:15,890
Fine, fine line from Avenue Q.

1858
02:04:18,230 --> 02:04:20,750
Have I ever sung this on stream before?

1859
02:04:21,070 --> 02:04:21,610
Hey I'm dragon.

1860
02:04:21,710 --> 02:04:22,430
Thanks for the ten gifted.

1861
02:04:22,890 --> 02:04:24,710
I used to audition with this song.

1862
02:04:25,870 --> 02:04:26,310
Um...

1863
02:04:29,670 --> 02:04:33,390
I used to audition for musicals with this song.

1864
02:04:35,890 --> 02:04:37,470
Good evening, Minto.

1865
02:04:37,590 --> 02:04:38,090
Good evening.

1866
02:04:47,630 --> 02:05:05,870
There's a fine fine line Between a lover and a friend There's a fine fine line Between reality and pretend And you never know till you reach the top

1867
02:05:18,350 --> 02:05:20,730
No, I never got in.

1868
02:05:20,910 --> 02:05:27,250
There's a fine, fine line between a fairy tale and a lie.

1869
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:34,510
And there's a fine, fine line between your wonderful and goodbye.

1870
02:05:34,510 --> 02:05:42,170
I guess if someone doesn't love you back, it isn't such a crime.

1871
02:05:42,690 --> 02:05:52,430
But there's a fine, fine line between love and a waste of your time.

1872
02:05:54,370 --> 02:05:59,450
And I don't have the time to waste on you anymore.

1873
02:06:01,770 --> 02:06:06,830
I don't think that you even know what you're looking for.

1874
02:06:09,050 --> 02:06:17,230
For my own sanity, I've got to close the door and walk away.

1875
02:06:19,910 --> 02:06:20,990
Oh.

1876
02:06:23,210 --> 02:06:29,430
There's a fine, fine line between together and you.

1877
02:06:29,450 --> 02:06:37,710
And there's a fine, fine line between what you wanted and what you got.

1878
02:06:39,890 --> 02:06:46,970
You gotta go after the things you want while you're still in your prime.

1879
02:06:51,310 --> 02:06:59,430
There's a fine, fine line between love and a waste of your time.

1880
02:07:07,730 --> 02:07:14,090
I was about to say something really mean.

1881
02:07:18,020 --> 02:07:19,140
Oh, man.

1882
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:27,740
Yeah, I never... I would... Maybe I should have changed what song I auditioned with because I never got into anything using that song, so... Oh, well.

1883
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:29,040
I just really liked it, though.

1884
02:07:30,220 --> 02:07:30,960
Say it!

1885
02:07:35,570 --> 02:07:39,890
Oh, no, I don't... She hates us?

1886
02:07:40,030 --> 02:07:40,510
No, no.

1887
02:07:41,290 --> 02:07:42,250
Not about you.

1888
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:47,390
It's... It's about where I used to work.

1889
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:52,540
Oh, man.

1890
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:53,500
Anyway.

1891
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:55,240
Let's see.

1892
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:57,880
I don't think I did any Disney, did I?

1893
02:07:58,640 --> 02:07:59,040
No.

1894
02:08:03,860 --> 02:08:04,600
Let's see.

1895
02:08:05,880 --> 02:08:06,880
Someone... Oh, Hercules.

1896
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:07,400
That's right.

1897
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:08,820
What's that song?

1898
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:09,040
Gwant?

1899
02:08:21,830 --> 02:08:22,650
Just a box.

1900
02:08:24,530 --> 02:08:32,450
If there's a prize for rotten judgment, I guess I already won that.

1901
02:08:33,290 --> 02:08:36,410
No man is worth the aggravation.

1902
02:08:37,770 --> 02:08:39,210
That's ancient history.

1903
02:08:39,270 --> 02:08:41,490
Been there, done that.

1904
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:43,010
Who do you think you're kidding?

1905
02:08:43,010 --> 02:08:45,650
He's the earth and heaven to you.

1906
02:08:45,710 --> 02:08:47,150
Try to keep it hidden.

1907
02:08:47,510 --> 02:08:49,570
Honey, we can see right through you.

1908
02:08:49,570 --> 02:08:51,130
Girl, you can't conceal it.

1909
02:08:51,230 --> 02:08:55,870
We know how you feel and who you're thinking of.

1910
02:08:56,130 --> 02:09:01,710
Oh, no chance, no way, I won't say no, no.

1911
02:09:01,990 --> 02:09:05,170
You swoon, you sigh, why deny it?

1912
02:09:05,170 --> 02:09:07,270
Oh, it's too cliche.

1913
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:10,110
I won't say I won't in love.

1914
02:09:10,170 --> 02:09:10,390
Sorry.

1915
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:12,570
You swoon, you sigh, why deny it?

1916
02:09:12,570 --> 02:09:12,570
Oh, it's too cliche.

1917
02:09:12,570 --> 02:09:12,570
I won't say I won't in love.

1918
02:09:12,570 --> 02:09:12,570
Sorry.

1919
02:09:12,570 --> 02:09:12,990
You swoon, you sigh, why deny it?

1920
02:09:12,990 --> 02:09:12,990
Oh, it's too cliche.

1921
02:09:12,990 --> 02:09:12,990
I won't say I won't in love.

1922
02:09:12,990 --> 02:09:12,990
Sorry.

1923
02:09:12,990 --> 02:09:13,950
Sometimes it just isn't fair, to miss that cause I really, really believe it.

1924
02:09:13,950 --> 02:09:16,270
I thought my heart had learned its lesson.

1925
02:09:17,230 --> 02:09:20,550
It feels so good when you start out.

1926
02:09:20,990 --> 02:09:21,590
Oh.

1927
02:09:21,590 --> 02:09:24,370
My head is screaming, get a grip, girl!

1928
02:09:25,110 --> 02:09:28,810
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out.

1929
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:31,610
Oh, oh anyway...

1930
02:09:35,690 --> 02:09:36,890
Oh no!

1931
02:09:40,190 --> 02:09:42,090
Sorry, my throat is so bad today.

1932
02:09:44,390 --> 02:09:49,150
Oh, no chance, no way, I won't say it, no, no.

1933
02:09:49,530 --> 02:09:51,290
I blame crazy frog.

1934
02:09:53,050 --> 02:09:57,290
This scene won't play, I won't say I'm in love.

1935
02:10:00,910 --> 02:10:04,310
Your way, oh god, I won't say it.

1936
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:08,630
Get out my case, I won't say it.

1937
02:10:09,190 --> 02:10:10,450
Need more water.

1938
02:10:11,530 --> 02:10:12,110
At

1939
02:10:17,700 --> 02:10:19,440
least I'm loud.

1940
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:24,720
I won't say I'm in love.

1941
02:10:29,580 --> 02:10:30,160
I

1942
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:35,300
like hearing your throat sounds.

1943
02:10:37,140 --> 02:10:38,160
What the hell?

1944
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:42,360
I might unarchive this since I sound so bad tonight.

1945
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:44,200
Sorry, I thought I'd be fine.

1946
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:47,300
I'm so out of water though.

1947
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:53,000
It's okay, I'm having fun.

1948
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:58,820
What's another Disney song I like?

1949
02:11:10,060 --> 02:11:11,260
Golden Hour?

1950
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:14,720
Sound great, can it, nerd?

1951
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:16,700
Takes one to know one.

1952
02:11:17,980 --> 02:11:18,580
Geez.

1953
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:20,160
Wait.

1954
02:11:23,740 --> 02:11:25,600
Beauty and the Beast.

1955
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:27,420
Wait.

1956
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:29,880
Which version do I want to sing?

1957
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:33,240
Wait,

1958
02:11:40,550 --> 02:11:41,530
wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no.

1959
02:11:41,550 --> 02:11:42,070
Not this one.

1960
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:45,170
Wait, do I have to turn this one up?

1961
02:11:45,310 --> 02:11:45,670
Do I have to...

1962
02:11:45,670 --> 02:11:48,550
I don't remember if I have to up this one or not.

1963
02:11:53,790 --> 02:11:54,870
I'll see you in a second.

1964
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:00,960
Sally Song!

1965
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:03,100
Oh, I can try.

1966
02:12:03,580 --> 02:12:04,760
It goes really high though.

1967
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:13,160
Hold on.

1968
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:14,060
This is a test.

1969
02:12:14,180 --> 02:12:15,820
I have to see if I need to pitch it up or not.

1970
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:19,140
I was the one who had it all.

1971
02:12:21,580 --> 02:12:24,340
I was the master of my fate.

1972
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:30,080
I never needed anybody in my life.

1973
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:33,660
I learned the truth too late.

1974
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:38,280
I'll never shake away the pain.

1975
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:43,240
I close my eyes but she's still there.

1976
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:49,060
I let her steal into my melancholy heart.

1977
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:52,780
It's more than I can bear.

1978
02:12:55,800 --> 02:13:04,520
Now I know she'll never leave me, even as she runs away.

1979
02:13:05,540 --> 02:13:14,020
She will still torment me, calm me, hurt me, move me, come what may.

1980
02:13:15,380 --> 02:13:23,380
Wasting in my lonely tower, waiting by an open door.

1981
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:28,200
I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in.

1982
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:33,500
And be with me forevermore.

1983
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:40,260
I rage against the trials of love.

1984
02:13:41,540 --> 02:13:44,580
I curse the fading of the light.

1985
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:50,600
Though she's already flown so far beyond my reach.

1986
02:13:51,020 --> 02:13:53,360
She's never out of my reach.

1987
02:13:56,120 --> 02:14:05,460
Now I know she'll never leave me, even as she fades from view.

1988
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:14,340
She will still inspire me, be a part of everything I do.

1989
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:23,360
Wasting in my lonely tower, waiting by an open door.

1990
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:28,600
I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in.

1991
02:14:30,160 --> 02:14:32,540
And as the long, long nights begin.

1992
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:36,980
I'll think of all that might have been.

1993
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:44,480
Waiting here forevermore.

1994
02:14:52,990 --> 02:14:54,310
Oh, I couldn't hold it.

1995
02:14:58,990 --> 02:15:02,230
Waiting here forevermore.

1996
02:15:02,230 --> 02:15:03,750
Waiting here forevermore.

1997
02:15:03,750 --> 02:15:04,450
Waiting here forevermore.

1998
02:15:04,750 --> 02:15:06,750
Waiting here forevermore.

1999
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:07,030
Waiting here forevermore.

2000
02:15:07,250 --> 02:15:07,710
Waiting here forevermore.

2001
02:15:08,270 --> 02:15:08,970
Waiting here forevermore.

2002
02:15:09,510 --> 02:15:10,650
Waiting here forevermore.

2003
02:15:10,750 --> 02:15:12,010
Waiting here forevermore.

2004
02:15:12,070 --> 02:15:13,410
Waiting here forevermore.

2005
02:15:13,430 --> 02:15:13,930
Waiting here forevermore.

2006
02:15:13,950 --> 02:15:14,030
Waiting here forevermore.

2007
02:15:14,030 --> 02:15:14,490
Waiting here forevermore.

2008
02:15:14,510 --> 02:15:15,630
Waiting here forevermore.

2009
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:16,430
Waiting here forevermore.

2010
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:19,290
Waiting here forevermore.

2011
02:15:20,410 --> 02:15:21,470
Waiting here forevermore.

2012
02:15:21,470 --> 02:15:23,330
Waiting here forevermore.

2013
02:15:23,330 --> 02:15:25,830
For Papa, I will stay.

2014
02:15:26,350 --> 02:15:30,690
But I don't deserve to lose my freedom in this way.

2015
02:15:30,910 --> 02:15:32,690
You monster.

2016
02:15:35,630 --> 02:15:44,870
If you think that what you've done is right, well then, you're a fool.

2017
02:15:48,030 --> 02:15:49,710
Think again.

2018
02:15:51,470 --> 02:15:54,290
I always wanted to be Belle on Broadway.

2019
02:15:54,610 --> 02:15:56,470
It's always my dream role.

2020
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:58,950
My dreamest, dreamest role.

2021
02:15:59,210 --> 02:16:00,670
Is this home?

2022
02:16:01,670 --> 02:16:05,810
Is this where I should learn to be happy?

2023
02:16:08,810 --> 02:16:14,850
Never dreamed that a home could be dark and blue.

2024
02:16:14,870 --> 02:16:15,570
And cold.

2025
02:16:17,030 --> 02:16:19,570
I was told.

2026
02:16:20,210 --> 02:16:26,750
Every day in my childhood, even when we grow old.

2027
02:16:28,490 --> 02:16:31,870
Home will be where the heart is.

2028
02:16:32,450 --> 02:16:35,650
Never were words so true.

2029
02:16:36,770 --> 02:16:40,190
My heart's far, far away.

2030
02:16:40,870 --> 02:16:42,890
Home is too.

2031
02:16:44,870 --> 02:16:47,170
Is this home?

2032
02:16:47,530 --> 02:16:52,370
Is this what I must learn to believe in?

2033
02:16:53,550 --> 02:17:00,470
Try to find something good in this tragic place.

2034
02:17:02,450 --> 02:17:04,790
Just in case.

2035
02:17:04,870 --> 02:17:07,830
I should stay here forever.

2036
02:17:08,130 --> 02:17:11,110
Held in this empty space.

2037
02:17:12,510 --> 02:17:14,110
Hold up.

2038
02:17:14,110 --> 02:17:14,850
But that won't do.

2039
02:17:14,870 --> 02:17:16,010
It won't be easy.

2040
02:17:16,410 --> 02:17:20,150
I know the reason why.

2041
02:17:20,630 --> 02:17:24,850
My heart's far, far away.

2042
02:17:25,570 --> 02:17:27,430
Home's a lie.

2043
02:17:29,130 --> 02:17:38,090
What I'd give to return to the life that I knew lately.

2044
02:17:38,710 --> 02:17:44,690
But I know that I can't solve my problems.

2045
02:17:44,690 --> 02:17:46,930
Going back.

2046
02:17:48,830 --> 02:17:51,270
Is this home?

2047
02:17:51,510 --> 02:17:55,870
Am I here for a day or forever?

2048
02:17:58,230 --> 02:17:59,890
Shot away.

2049
02:18:00,170 --> 02:18:04,910
From the world until who knows when.

2050
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:11,980
As my life has been altered.

2051
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:14,840
Once it can change again.

2052
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:19,840
Build higher walls around me.

2053
02:18:20,060 --> 02:18:23,580
Change every lock and key.

2054
02:18:24,510 --> 02:18:25,900
Nothing lasts.

2055
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:28,400
Nothing holds.

2056
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:30,780
All of me.

2057
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:39,220
My heart's far, far away.

2058
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:41,820
Home...

2059
02:18:55,580 --> 02:18:56,680
It's only from the musical.

2060
02:18:56,900 --> 02:18:57,620
Beauty and the Beast.

2061
02:18:57,780 --> 02:18:58,200
Oh, sorry.

2062
02:18:58,320 --> 02:18:58,880
You can't read it.

2063
02:18:58,900 --> 02:18:59,760
Beauty and...

2064
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:01,680
Beauty and the Beast.

2065
02:19:03,560 --> 02:19:04,100
Thank you.

2066
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:04,520
Thank you.

2067
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:04,920
Thank you.

2068
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:05,260
Thank you.

2069
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:05,660
Thank you.

2070
02:19:06,220 --> 02:19:06,940
Someone requested.

2071
02:19:07,060 --> 02:19:07,640
Almost there.

2072
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:09,640
Oh, hold on.

2073
02:19:09,700 --> 02:19:11,620
I know Gold... People have been screaming about Golden Hour.

2074
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:11,980
Okay.

2075
02:19:12,020 --> 02:19:12,440
I'll get it.

2076
02:19:12,500 --> 02:19:13,400
I'll do it.

2077
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:13,920
I'll do it.

2078
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:14,980
I'll do it.

2079
02:19:15,020 --> 02:19:15,400
I'll do it.

2080
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:15,960
Newsies?

2081
02:19:16,020 --> 02:19:16,600
I'm sorry.

2082
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:18,040
I actually don't know Newsies.

2083
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:37,090
It was just two lovers sitting in the car.

2084
02:19:37,090 --> 02:19:38,010
Listening to Blonde.

2085
02:19:38,050 --> 02:19:39,070
Falling for each other.

2086
02:19:39,550 --> 02:19:40,830
Pink and orange skies.

2087
02:19:40,970 --> 02:19:41,770
Feeling super child.

2088
02:19:41,990 --> 02:19:42,870
There's no Donald Glover.

2089
02:19:43,350 --> 02:19:44,710
Miss Glover, my mother.

2090
02:19:45,310 --> 02:19:46,430
Like you were yet tonight.

2091
02:19:46,610 --> 02:19:47,370
Got no alibi.

2092
02:19:47,610 --> 02:19:48,770
All I was all alone.

2093
02:19:48,930 --> 02:19:52,150
With the love of my life.

2094
02:19:52,410 --> 02:19:54,430
She's got glitter for skin.

2095
02:19:54,750 --> 02:19:57,590
My radiant beam in the night.

2096
02:19:58,430 --> 02:19:58,990
My radiant beam in the night.

2097
02:19:59,190 --> 02:19:59,750
My radiant beam in the night.

2098
02:19:59,750 --> 02:20:01,310
I don't need no light.

2099
02:20:01,530 --> 02:20:05,090
To see you shine.

2100
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:06,190
To see you shine.

2101
02:20:09,210 --> 02:20:12,930
It's your Golden Hour.

2102
02:20:17,470 --> 02:20:20,550
You slowed down time.

2103
02:20:24,350 --> 02:20:28,310
In your Golden Hour.

2104
02:20:34,980 --> 02:20:35,500
You slowed down time.

2105
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:35,560
In your Golden Hour.

2106
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:36,400
We were just two lovers.

2107
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:38,220
Feet up on the dash.

2108
02:20:38,380 --> 02:20:39,200
Driving over fast.

2109
02:20:39,300 --> 02:20:40,180
Burning through the summer.

2110
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:42,000
Radio on blast.

2111
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:42,960
Make the moment last.

2112
02:20:43,140 --> 02:20:43,860
She got solar power.

2113
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:45,940
Minutes feel like hours.

2114
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:47,920
She knew she was the baddest.

2115
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:48,660
Can you even imagine?

2116
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:49,900
Falling like I did.

2117
02:20:50,020 --> 02:20:53,180
For the love of my life.

2118
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:53,900
For the love of my life.

2119
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:55,860
She's got glow on her face.

2120
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:58,500
A glorious look in her eyes.

2121
02:20:59,560 --> 02:21:00,180
A glorious look in her eyes.

2122
02:21:00,320 --> 02:21:02,500
My angel of light.

2123
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:03,340
My angel of light.

2124
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:05,180
I was all alone.

2125
02:21:05,340 --> 02:21:08,440
With the love of my life.

2126
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:10,860
She's got glitter for skin.

2127
02:21:11,180 --> 02:21:14,000
My radiant beam in the night.

2128
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:14,280
My radiant beam in the night.

2129
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:15,400
She's got the light of her life.

2130
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:18,730
I don't need no light.

2131
02:21:18,730 --> 02:21:21,490
To see you shine.

2132
02:21:23,370 --> 02:21:24,650
To see you shine.

2133
02:21:24,730 --> 02:21:28,310
It's your golden hour.

2134
02:21:33,090 --> 02:21:33,710
It's your golden hour.

2135
02:21:33,710 --> 02:21:36,750
You slow down time.

2136
02:21:37,190 --> 02:21:38,470
You slow down time.

2137
02:21:39,230 --> 02:21:44,610
In your golden hour.

2138
02:21:57,560 --> 02:21:58,180
In your golden hour.

2139
02:21:58,180 --> 02:22:01,200
Oh, so

2140
02:22:24,650 --> 02:22:24,730
is that girl.

2141
02:22:24,730 --> 02:22:26,010
Oh, so is that girl.

2142
02:22:42,150 --> 02:22:46,930
I'm the longest outro ever.

2143
02:22:48,790 --> 02:22:50,050
Auto-caffeine?

2144
02:22:50,210 --> 02:22:50,850
I think so.

2145
02:22:59,540 --> 02:23:02,200
Mama, I don't have time for dancing.

2146
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:05,560
That's just gonna have to wait a while.

2147
02:23:06,940 --> 02:23:10,340
Ain't got time for messing around.

2148
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:13,260
And it's not my style.

2149
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:18,360
This whole town can slow you down.

2150
02:23:18,480 --> 02:23:21,260
People taking the easy way.

2151
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:25,540
But I know exactly where I'm going.

2152
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:28,500
Getting closer and closer every day.

2153
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:30,760
And I'm almost there.

2154
02:23:31,860 --> 02:23:33,840
I'm almost there.

2155
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:37,220
People down here think I'm crazy.

2156
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:39,760
But I don't care.

2157
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:43,440
Trials and tribulations.

2158
02:23:44,300 --> 02:23:45,860
I've had my share.

2159
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:49,600
There ain't nothing gonna stop me now.

2160
02:23:49,780 --> 02:23:51,880
Cause I'm almost there.

2161
02:23:56,720 --> 02:23:59,780
I remember daddy told me.

2162
02:24:00,400 --> 02:24:02,500
Fairy tales can come true.

2163
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:06,540
You gotta make them happen.

2164
02:24:06,620 --> 02:24:08,620
It all depends on you.

2165
02:24:08,860 --> 02:24:12,480
So I work real hard each and every day.

2166
02:24:12,700 --> 02:24:15,600
Now things for sure are going my way.

2167
02:24:16,360 --> 02:24:18,560
Just doing what I do.

2168
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:21,660
Look out boys, I'm coming through.

2169
02:24:21,780 --> 02:24:24,000
And I'm almost there.

2170
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:27,140
I'm almost there.

2171
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:30,740
People gonna come here from everywhere.

2172
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:33,100
And I'm almost there.

2173
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:35,180
I'm almost

2174
02:24:48,070 --> 02:24:48,510
there.

2175
02:24:48,510 --> 02:24:51,750
There's been trials and tribulations.

2176
02:24:52,370 --> 02:24:54,510
You know I've had my share.

2177
02:24:55,510 --> 02:24:57,270
But I've climbed the mountain.

2178
02:24:57,290 --> 02:24:58,710
I've crossed the river.

2179
02:24:58,810 --> 02:25:00,850
And I'm almost there.

2180
02:25:01,470 --> 02:25:03,950
I'm almost there.

2181
02:25:04,450 --> 02:25:08,650
I'm almost there.

2182
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:24,640
Almost there.

2183
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:26,180
You're there?

2184
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:27,540
I don't think so.

2185
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:28,120
But that's okay.

2186
02:25:32,120 --> 02:25:34,040
I wonder if this song is on here.

2187
02:25:35,780 --> 02:25:36,980
I don't see it.

2188
02:25:39,400 --> 02:25:39,980
Oh well.

2189
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:49,820
Shadow cross.

2190
02:25:49,940 --> 02:25:50,940
Six of the five gifted.

2191
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:52,660
I never know when to stop.

2192
02:25:54,740 --> 02:25:56,620
I always just want to keep going.

2193
02:25:59,780 --> 02:26:00,180
Hmm.

2194
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:02,160
Trying to think.

2195
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:03,380
Oh someone requested this.

2196
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:06,620
And I do kind of want to sing it.

2197
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:08,840
It'll help us go to sleep.

2198
02:26:09,700 --> 02:26:12,420
Actually it's a song that my mom used to sing to me to sleep.

2199
02:26:12,660 --> 02:26:13,360
Every night.

2200
02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:15,360
So.

2201
02:26:16,060 --> 02:26:16,980
I might cry.

2202
02:26:18,860 --> 02:26:19,860
I might cry.

2203
02:26:22,900 --> 02:26:25,540
It's probably not a song you hear very much in Vtuber karaoke.

2204
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:26,260
But that's okay.

2205
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:47,860
This should be a song that you guys listen to if you read the song.

2206
02:26:47,860 --> 02:26:48,060
But honestly, It's okay.

2207
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:52,680
Every time I lie down, especially if I'm not able to sleep.

2208
02:26:52,980 --> 02:26:53,040
I看 the radio in my head or something like that.

2209
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:53,220
geme

2210
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:06,280
I was right.

2211
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:07,380
I was artwork -able.

2212
02:27:09,240 --> 02:28:06,020
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby Somewhere over the rainbow, the skies are blue And the dreams that you dare to dream Really do come true Someday I'll wish upon a star And wake up where the clouds are far behind me Where troubles melt like lemon drops Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me,

2213
02:28:08,550 --> 02:28:26,210
somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly, birds fly over the rainbow.

2214
02:28:27,970 --> 02:28:35,590
Why, oh why, can't... I

2215
02:28:42,040 --> 02:28:43,180
don't know this version at all.

2216
02:28:44,200 --> 02:28:47,360
It says it's the Judy Garland version, but...

2217
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:57,520
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow, why, oh why...

2218
02:29:13,770 --> 02:29:14,630
Yay!

2219
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:16,350
Oh, I'm not gonna lie, I was tearing up.

2220
02:29:17,350 --> 02:29:19,050
I was tearing up.

2221
02:29:24,870 --> 02:29:27,310
Oh, I'm not gonna lie, I was tearing up.

2222
02:29:27,310 --> 02:29:27,310
I was tearing up.

2223
02:29:27,310 --> 02:29:28,770
Any other lullaby songs?

2224
02:29:29,170 --> 02:29:30,490
What's another lullaby song?

2225
02:29:30,690 --> 02:29:32,410
What's another really quiet, soft song?

2226
02:29:34,790 --> 02:29:36,430
What's a song to sleep to?

2227
02:29:38,470 --> 02:29:40,390
Sad song when you think about it.

2228
02:29:40,450 --> 02:29:42,030
When you think about her, Judy Garland?

2229
02:29:42,210 --> 02:29:42,770
I know, right?

2230
02:29:43,270 --> 02:29:44,350
Gosh, so sad.

2231
02:29:45,550 --> 02:29:47,350
Where's her whole thing?

2232
02:29:47,730 --> 02:29:48,290
Letter?

2233
02:29:50,950 --> 02:29:51,910
Break stuff, yeah.

2234
02:29:55,290 --> 02:29:56,410
Have a good sleep, Minto.

2235
02:29:56,570 --> 02:29:57,190
Thank you.

2236
02:29:57,210 --> 02:29:57,870
I'll do one more.

2237
02:29:59,030 --> 02:30:02,810
Moon River, oh my gosh, I did that song in a recital once.

2238
02:30:03,150 --> 02:30:04,590
I'm truly gobsmacked.

2239
02:30:04,850 --> 02:30:05,430
What's that mean?

2240
02:30:08,170 --> 02:30:10,150
Here's to you, Nicola and Bart.

2241
02:30:10,570 --> 02:30:11,850
That's so sad.

2242
02:30:12,210 --> 02:30:12,690
Okay.

2243
02:30:15,510 --> 02:30:16,230
You know what?

2244
02:30:16,250 --> 02:30:19,770
End on a Metal Gear song.

2245
02:30:22,710 --> 02:30:23,470
Oh, technically.

2246
02:30:28,470 --> 02:30:31,030
Actually, is there a slow version or is it only the fast version?

2247
02:30:31,690 --> 02:30:33,590
I think there's only the fast version, right?

2248
02:30:34,930 --> 02:30:35,570
Let me see.

2249
02:30:37,990 --> 02:30:39,510
I think it's only the fast version.

2250
02:30:44,170 --> 02:30:44,550
Oh.

2251
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:45,670
Oh, it's the slow version.

2252
02:30:45,810 --> 02:30:46,230
Okay, good.

2253
02:30:47,810 --> 02:30:49,430
Oh my god, it's buzzing in my right ear.

2254
02:30:51,970 --> 02:30:53,630
Wait, I think it picks up, actually.

2255
02:31:22,480 --> 02:31:23,440
07, 07.

2256
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:25,560
07, 07.

2257
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:29,680
I think it's gonna get louder in a second.

2258
02:31:32,740 --> 02:31:35,760
Here's to you, Nicola and Bart.

2259
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:40,500
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2260
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:44,440
The last and final moment is yours.

2261
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:48,720
That agony is your triumph.

2262
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:52,840
Here's to you, Nicola and Bart.

2263
02:31:53,480 --> 02:31:57,500
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2264
02:31:57,640 --> 02:32:01,440
The last and final moment is yours.

2265
02:32:01,780 --> 02:32:05,640
That agony is your triumph.

2266
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:09,960
Here's to you, Nicola and Bart.

2267
02:32:10,060 --> 02:32:10,480
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2268
02:32:10,480 --> 02:32:14,520
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2269
02:32:14,680 --> 02:32:18,560
The last and final moment is yours.

2270
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:22,720
That agony is your triumph.

2271
02:32:23,380 --> 02:32:26,900
Here's to you, Nicola and Bart.

2272
02:32:27,540 --> 02:32:31,460
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2273
02:32:31,740 --> 02:32:35,600
The last and final moment is yours.

2274
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:39,740
That agony is your triumph.

2275
02:32:39,740 --> 02:32:43,920
Here's to you, Nicola and Bart.

2276
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:48,700
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2277
02:32:48,840 --> 02:32:52,560
The last and final moment is yours.

2278
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:56,880
That agony is your triumph.

2279
02:32:57,580 --> 02:33:01,160
Here's to you, Nicola and Bart.

2280
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:04,140
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2281
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:09,780
The last and final moment is yours.

2282
02:33:10,060 --> 02:33:13,980
That agony is your triumph.

2283
02:33:14,600 --> 02:33:18,080
Here's to you, Nicola and Bart.

2284
02:33:18,760 --> 02:33:22,420
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2285
02:33:22,860 --> 02:33:26,740
The last and final moment is yours.

2286
02:33:26,840 --> 02:33:30,880
That agony is your triumph.

2287
02:33:31,940 --> 02:33:35,060
Here's to you, Nicola and Bart.

2288
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,620
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2289
02:33:39,860 --> 02:33:43,760
The last and final moment is yours.

2290
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:47,880
That agony is your triumph.

2291
02:33:48,860 --> 02:33:50,220
Here's- oh, oh, that's it.

2292
02:33:50,320 --> 02:33:51,320
Sorry, I wasn't looking.

2293
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:55,740
Oh, is it- I wonder if there's a- I wonder if there's a slow version.

2294
02:33:56,460 --> 02:33:57,880
Like MGS4 version.

2295
02:33:58,140 --> 02:33:59,120
Hold on, I'm checking.

2296
02:33:59,120 --> 02:33:59,760
Sorry.

2297
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:02,740
Sorry, I'm checking.

2298
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:04,080
Hold on, let me see if this works.

2299
02:34:05,220 --> 02:34:11,700
It'll actually be a real... a real bedtime song then, maybe.

2300
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:16,860
The slow version is from 4.

2301
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:21,200
Yeah, this one, the faster one is... I think it's the original one is the fastest one, but it's also...

2302
02:34:25,700 --> 02:34:26,460
It's also...

2303
02:34:28,700 --> 02:34:30,020
It's also... what's the word?

2304
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:30,440
Oh my gosh.

2305
02:34:31,160 --> 02:34:34,260
It's also... the one in the end of 4 is I think what I was going to say.

2306
02:34:35,420 --> 02:34:35,740
Yeah.

2307
02:34:36,080 --> 02:34:36,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2308
02:34:41,420 --> 02:34:41,740
Sorry,

2309
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:45,340
I'm checking.

2310
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:50,080
I want to make sure I get the ad-libs right, but you know what?

2311
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:51,400
It's fine, I guess.

2312
02:34:57,460 --> 02:34:57,780
Okay.

2313
02:35:00,380 --> 02:35:01,160
That should be it.

2314
02:35:10,790 --> 02:35:12,270
MGS4 version is so emotional.

2315
02:35:12,970 --> 02:35:13,750
It is.

2316
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:24,440
I might not get the timing right when it starts, but...

2317
02:35:30,610 --> 02:35:31,610
I'm feeling it.

2318
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:32,370
I'm feeling it.

2319
02:35:41,060 --> 02:35:42,000
It's so sad.

2320
02:35:47,990 --> 02:35:49,090
I think it's now.

2321
02:35:49,970 --> 02:35:51,350
Here's to you.

2322
02:35:51,350 --> 02:35:54,650
Nicola Embart.

2323
02:35:54,910 --> 02:36:02,010
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2324
02:36:02,290 --> 02:36:07,970
The last and final moment is yours.

2325
02:36:08,050 --> 02:36:14,510
That agony is your triumph.

2326
02:36:18,860 --> 02:36:21,060
Here's to you.

2327
02:36:21,060 --> 02:36:24,400
Nicola Embart.

2328
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:31,360
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2329
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:37,400
The last and final moment is yours.

2330
02:36:37,460 --> 02:36:43,560
That agony is your triumph.

2331
02:36:44,980 --> 02:36:47,120
Here's to you.

2332
02:36:47,660 --> 02:36:50,280
Nicola Embart.

2333
02:36:50,280 --> 02:36:51,040
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2334
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:57,280
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2335
02:36:57,320 --> 02:37:03,300
The last and final moment is yours.

2336
02:37:03,700 --> 02:37:09,500
That agony is your triumph.

2337
02:37:11,340 --> 02:37:13,600
Here's to you.

2338
02:37:14,780 --> 02:37:16,820
Here's to you.

2339
02:37:20,760 --> 02:37:22,600
Here's to you.

2340
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:29,260
The last and final moment is yours.

2341
02:37:29,740 --> 02:37:35,180
That agony is your triumph.

2342
02:37:36,760 --> 02:37:38,840
Here's to you.

2343
02:38:02,700 --> 02:38:04,820
Here's to you.

2344
02:38:04,820 --> 02:38:07,980
Nikola and Bart.

2345
02:38:08,740 --> 02:38:14,840
Rest forever here in our hearts.

2346
02:38:15,140 --> 02:38:21,040
The last and final moment is yours.

2347
02:38:21,260 --> 02:38:27,200
That agony is your triumph.
