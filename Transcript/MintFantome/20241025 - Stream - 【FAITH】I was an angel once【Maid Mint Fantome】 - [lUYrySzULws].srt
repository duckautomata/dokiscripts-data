1
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,620
My children, I have one question to ask of you.

2
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,640
Can nuns have coffee?

3
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,560
Down the hedge!

4
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,260
Coffee isn't restricted.

5
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,240
Let's go!

6
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,750
Amen!

7
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,750
Welcome to church, everybody.

8
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,810
Today, in my church, we talk about...

9
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,730
We worship more in this church.

10
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,310
Why is my tongue coming out?

11
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,670
I think I got the devil in me.

12
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,930
Begone, beast!

13
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,950
Begone!

14
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:15,970
Begone!

15
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:16,450
Begone!

16
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:23,050
The power of this plastic cross compels you!

17
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,880
Deliver us from this freakness.

18
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,520
Amen.

19
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,060
Can I get an amen?

20
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,660
Can I get an amen?

21
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,380
Amen.

22
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,560
No!

23
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,060
Welcome back, master and princess!

24
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,780
Thank you for the gifted!

25
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,880
Welcome, everybody, to faith!

26
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,400
The unholy trinity.

27
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:12,680
Except, well, it is a trinity, but we're gonna be playing one or two games today.

28
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,040
We'll see how I'm feeling.

29
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,260
Oh my goodness, so many people!

30
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:19,880
Thank you!

31
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,480
Why does my tongue keep coming out?

32
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,540
I can't keep it in!

33
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,300
I need to be baptized.

34
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,400
In the fluids of a lovely scent.

35
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,960
Like

36
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,670
a bath bomb.

37
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,830
Fun!

38
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,750
Thanks for the tag, gifted!

39
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:56,870
Hallelujah!

40
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,670
Cooper Black, thanks for the tag, gifted!

41
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,810
Thank you, Exit Mint!

42
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,010
Happy birthday!

43
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,170
Happy birthday to you!

44
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,070
Happy birthday to you!

45
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,130
Happy birthday, Exit Mint!

46
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,370
That's me, but it's also you!

47
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,450
Happy birthday to you!

48
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,190
Yeah, I don't know.

49
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,430
This morning, well, last night I went to bed with a headache and I woke up with the same headache.

50
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:28,970
Icky.

51
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,490
Yeah, we hate that.

52
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,830
But...

53
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,810
I'm feeling okay now, but just in case.

54
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:47,690
I might feel better later and we can do games 1 and 2.

55
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,570
So, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see.

56
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,510
But other than that, I'm feeling so good.

57
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,250
Yeah, I'm feeling...

58
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:03,870
My debut is in one week and I still need two things for it.

59
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,090
They're pretty big things, but they're getting worked on.

60
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,130
Hopefully, they're done in time.

61
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,470
My profile picture terrifies me.

62
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:15,890
Why?

63
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,050
It's just a silhouette.

64
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,150
It's just a silhouette.

65
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,250
What?

66
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,850
Is it like a shadow ghost is what you're thinking of, maybe?

67
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,430
Rest well, Sister Mint.

68
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,490
Thank you.

69
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,930
Sister, I've always wanted a brother.

70
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,930
I've always wanted a brother.

71
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,430
Oh, gosh.

72
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,810
Does anyone know if the VIP tickets for the concert sold out?

73
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,650
Carl, that's a great question!

74
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,610
That's a great question.

75
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,190
There was like some issue with the ticket website.

76
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,230
It's not on, apparently, OshieSpark's end.

77
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,230
And OshieSpark double checked with them to make sure everything was good.

78
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,230
Boo!

79
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,670
We hate ticket websites!

80
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,890
They're always so bad.

81
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,250
So, I'm so sorry if you could not get a VIP ticket.

82
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,910
I'm so, so sorry.

83
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,630
But there will be some more releasing tomorrow.

84
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,330
I believe tomorrow morning.

85
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,890
So, they're not entirely gone.

86
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,050
I think that's... I don't know the time.

87
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,550
I'm so sorry, but...

88
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,950
Check OshieSpark on Twitter for the time.

89
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:01,970
Yeah, yeah.

90
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,310
Can't wait to watch you perform in Atlanta.

91
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,710
Also, one week until 3.0.

92
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,370
Thanks for Atlanta!

93
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,870
Oh, my gosh, congrats on getting the VIP!

94
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,910
So, 10 AM EST?

95
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,290
Okay.

96
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,430
So, it is 10 AM EST, same time as today.

97
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:20,970
So, hopefully...

98
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,710
Hopefully, if you did not get one today, you can get one tomorrow.

99
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,210
Wow!

100
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,290
GooseDefend!

101
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,470
Thanks for the perk!

102
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,850
Not sure if you'll be streaming this weekend, but if you do, I'll do a bust-in in advance.

103
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,110
Time to take a rest from your migraine I'm spending this weekend in Vermont.

104
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,410
First time in America outside of Florida.

105
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,370
And before everyone chants, USA!

106
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,370
USA!

107
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,450
USA!

108
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,470
USA!

109
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,270
I hope you... Oh, my gosh, Vermont is so beautiful.

110
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,470
I hope you love it.

111
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,410
Mandy!

112
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,710
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

113
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,170
I should be streaming this weekend.

114
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,510
Wait...

115
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:05,870
Like...

116
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,010
Like 26, 27?

117
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,310
Yeah, I'm streaming.

118
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,010
I have a schedule.

119
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,310
I have a schedule.

120
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,170
According to the schedule, you are...

121
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,530
Yeah, on Saturday, I'm finishing Devil May Cry.

122
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,430
Sunday, I'm doing a karaoke relay.

123
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,330
And I'm also playing Astro Bot.

124
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,230
So, I'm very excited.

125
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,550
Oh, my gosh, I'm out this weekend.

126
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,750
Yippee!

127
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,790
I'm so excited.

128
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,430
Oh, my gosh.

129
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,190
Joey!

130
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,430
Welcome to Mambo Shabang!

131
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,930
Do you know any Latin or Romance language at all, Minto?

132
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,170
Why is my tongue coming out?

133
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,410
That's my Romance language.

134
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,930
Hold on, give me a second.

135
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,070
Maybe I need to reset my pace.

136
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:57,810
I...

137
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,650
I need to... It's like...

138
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,890
What's those things where it's like...

139
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,100
I have to write on the chalkboard.

140
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
I will not be freaky.

141
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,640
I will not be freaky.

142
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,220
Freak is my Romance language.

143
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,740
How's the music, by the way?

144
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,400
I've been talking over it.

145
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,340
But let me know if it's been too loud or not.

146
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,660
I forgot.

147
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,580
Yeah, the Bart Simpson's meme.

148
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there we go.

149
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,000
Sorry, I could not remember his name for a second.

150
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,340
It's a bit loud.

151
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,020
Look at this.

152
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,500
It's at 50%.

153
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,220
Maybe that's better.

154
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,040
I had to turn it down so much.

155
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,600
Loud game.

156
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:02,660
But yeah, so...

157
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,960
Yeah.

158
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,120
I hope you guys are doing well.

159
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,800
What's today?

160
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
Thursday.

161
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240
It's Thursday, my dudes.

162
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,100
And we are playing Faze!

163
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,260
Yippee!

164
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,220
Let's get started.

165
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,120
Chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3.

166
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,260
Marathon.

167
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,060
All three chapters in one session.

168
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,060
See if I were endurance.

169
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,540
Hang on.

170
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,900
Get your mortises ready.

171
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,180
No, I'm gonna game.

172
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,540
Joy!

173
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,100
Thanks for the 50!

174
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
You'll get... what's this?

175
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,020
Oh, notes.

176
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,440
Thank you for singing.

177
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,120
Happy birthday to me.

178
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,340
You made me really happy.

179
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,900
Really love this game series.

180
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,940
I hope you like it.

181
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,620
Thank you!

182
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,920
I have played it once before.

183
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,180
Wow, there's so many different modes.

184
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,480
Flashlight mode, lantern mode, turbo...

185
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,050
It's so quiet now.

186
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,060
How do I flash?

187
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,980
Flash, flash, flash.

188
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,520
Have you forgotten already?

189
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,200
This forest has a mind of its own.

190
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,380
If you get lost, you could always try remembering where you've been.

191
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,260
I've been chatting with A.I.

192
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:30,620
Minto.

193
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,940
But like...

194
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,860
She...

195
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,020
She doesn't get you like I do.

196
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:42,780
Right?

197
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,160
You're just like, oh yeah, A.I.

198
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,540
Minto, but...

199
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,460
Repent.

200
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,940
Hey, I got nothing on real Minto.

201
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,440
Yeah?

202
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,490
What is this parasocialness?

203
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,350
Okay, Anthony, that's rich coming from you.

204
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,030
You...

205
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,450
You're just like, oh, I'm gonna crawl in there and die.

206
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,810
Yeah, well, you know, just because I'm not as boobielicious as Matara, okay?

207
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,070
I mean...

208
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,050
If you crawled in where I am, you would have more room.

209
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,190
Probably.

210
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,850
If everybody crawled in, everybody would be able to have their own like...

211
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,150
Plot of land, probably.

212
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,350
You know, doesn't that sound nice too?

213
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,710
You're not on top of each other.

214
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,450
Right?

215
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:58,610
Instead of being all cramped and smushed and on top of everybody.

216
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,670
Yeah, everybody would have space to own their own real estate, basically.

217
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,430
There's enough space in there for everybody, probably.

218
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:11,630
You know?

219
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,820
I blocked Matara-Kan until the end of the month, so I don't have to see her profile picture anymore.

220
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,160
When I haven't told her, so I don't know if she'll ever notice.

221
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,870
Anyway, she hates Mata.

222
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,970
I have to block her.

223
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,190
I have to block her.

224
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,750
It's for the bit.

225
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,670
I don't know what she's yapping about.

226
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,870
I just want to show my love for Min.

227
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,590
Thank you.

228
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,630
I've joined the club of wisps in their 30s today.

229
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,810
May I get a birthday song as well?

230
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:09,510
Noah!

231
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,970
Happy birthday to you.

232
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,590
You are kind of old.

233
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,490
But welcome to the old club.

234
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,410
Happy birthday, Noah.

235
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,130
Happy birthday.

236
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,770
It's been a while since I've been able to properly watch one of your streams since I moved to Japan.

237
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,010
Inspired by me.

238
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,610
I'm glad I can catch one before I go to work today.

239
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,430
Thank you for being so awesome.

240
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,110
Good luck with work, Doki.

241
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,570
Alright, let's keep playing game, guys.

242
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,430
Let's keep playing game.

243
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,490
Min is far from small.

244
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,390
I mean, I would like to say that I am the medium premium.

245
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,470
Right?

246
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,490
I believe in...

247
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,250
Well, I mean, any size is a prize, I will always say.

248
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,590
But uh...

249
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,610
Um...

250
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,890
You know...

251
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,670
You haven't seen 3.0 yet.

252
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,610
And um...

253
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,260
So...

254
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,640
I might have had to fight my mama.

255
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,360
They were like...

256
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,040
But...

257
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,200
I love drawing boobs.

258
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,680
I was like, you can!

259
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:57,120
And if you draw with the big boobs, it's like an isekai version.

260
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,140
Maybe.

261
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,200
So...

262
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,240
You know...

263
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:18,290
So, you know, everybody who draws me always draws me with such big boobs, but that's never been the case ever.

264
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,390
I don't understand how it happened.

265
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,330
Anyway...

266
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:29,860
Anyway...

267
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,680
Where was I?

268
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh, I'm reading this note, you guys.

269
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,120
Come on, stop talking.

270
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,400
Why are you guys being such freaks?

271
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,340
Talking about my chest, it's so weird.

272
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,560
We're...

273
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,740
We are...

274
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,840
We are reading.

275
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,980
It's good for your brain to read.

276
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,890
We saw your Lilith post.

277
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,390
If you think about it...

278
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,110
Amatara would be Morrigan and I would be Lilith.

279
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,890
It's like the same...

280
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,590
Body type, I would think.

281
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,570
Where was I?

282
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,690
Oh, I'm gonna start over.

283
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:15,970
Okay.

284
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,670
Oh gosh, maybe the coffee was a bad idea.

285
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,810
I'm feeling it.

286
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,750
I thought we were supposed to talk about your butt normally.

287
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,290
Yeah!

288
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,130
Well, not right now.

289
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,970
We're playing a game.

290
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,510
Have you forgotten already?

291
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:33,370
See?

292
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,290
Even the game is calling us out.

293
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,230
Have you forgotten already that you're playing a game?

294
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,310
Please.

295
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,670
Please remember.

296
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,610
You're playing a game.

297
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,010
This forest has a mind of its own.

298
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,310
If you get lost, you could always try remembering where you've been.

299
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,010
Pressing the escape key or start button is a good place to start.

300
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,410
If you're in a hurry, hold spacebar or the action button.

301
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,270
If you're in a hurry, hold spacebar or the action button.

302
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,750
To skip cutscenes.

303
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,810
This was...

304
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,730
Not as...

305
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,710
Like...

306
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,370
Lory than I thought.

307
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:07,990
Here we go.

308
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,730
Oh my gosh, I didn't think the demons came out so fast.

309
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,030
Do you remember?

310
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,350
Get out of here.

311
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,070
Yeah, yeah, get out of here.

312
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,330
Oh.

313
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,150
A well.

314
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,150
Hello?

315
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,550
Oh gosh!

316
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,770
Hey, I was busy here.

317
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,290
We're closer to your heart.

318
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,250
Come celebrate Nate and Jason's 6th birthday.

319
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,230
Saturday, May 3rd.

320
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,750
12PM to 4PM.

321
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,770
Turn right at 1338...

322
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,070
Snakeman.

323
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,050
I will be freaky.

324
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,830
I will be freaky.

325
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,590
I will be freaky.

326
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,870
Had to spam refresh the page, but I was lucky enough to get VIP tickets.

327
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,310
Yippee!

328
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,570
I was so happy.

329
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,310
Congrats!

330
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,130
Go straight past the well.

331
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,730
Oh, we can go straight past the well.

332
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:16,150
Perfect.

333
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,410
Oh gosh.

334
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,190
Straight past the well.

335
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,630
Straight past the well.

336
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,330
Straight past the well.

337
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,210
It's locked.

338
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,230
How do I get in?

339
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:42,730
Excuse me.

340
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:43,930
Is there a back door?

341
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,670
Luckily, this cross doubles as a lockpick.

342
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,390
Okay.

343
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,770
Nevermind.

344
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,630
Is there a key under this rock?

345
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,770
I thought about getting lockpicked.

346
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,090
Lockpick certified.

347
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,010
So I can do lockpicking streams.

348
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:15,210
Hey!

349
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,290
Give me the key!

350
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,150
What did he say?

351
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,770
That's...

352
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,590
What did he say?

353
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,830
Maybe the key is here.

354
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,750
Lockpicking streams.

355
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:34,970
Yeah, why not?

356
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,530
Oh, this one.

357
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,110
Oh my goodness.

358
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,470
Mr. Martin.

359
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:51,230
It has taken longer than expected registering the markers on your property as a historical cemetery.

360
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,410
Our office had difficulty identifying who was buried there.

361
00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:00,410
The inscriptions on the gravestones are written in a language that we cannot identify.

362
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:06,750
I've sent the gravestone rubbings to some of my peers at the University of Connecticut.

363
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,570
I will reach out to you when I get a response from there.

364
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,570
All the best.

365
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,370
Daryl Henderson, State of Connecticut Historical Society

366
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,590
Yeah.

367
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,630
I will become a lockpicking master and then you better watch out.

368
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,050
Daryl sucks at his job.

369
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,210
Just Google it.

370
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,890
Just Google the name.

371
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,170
Ok, hold on.

372
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,250
It's a little loud.

373
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,440
Map!

374
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,380
That's so cute.

375
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,920
Barabash!

376
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,180
Thanks for the superchat!

377
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,200
Thank you!

378
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,640
Haunted rubble.

379
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,480
Public lecture.

380
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,460
By Carl James Osborne.

381
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,100
Connecticut's historical connections to witchcraft, satanism, and the beast system.

382
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,480
Wednesday 8pm.

383
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,020
But where?

384
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,460
Where, Carl?

385
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
You forgot the most important part!

386
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,980
Carl's like, At your mom's house.

387
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,830
The beast system.

388
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,440
My favorite OS.

389
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,040
He's like, I'll tell you how to be a beast.

390
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,860
With your mom.

391
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,520
Gary loves you.

392
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,540
Are you still coming after me?

393
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,080
Haunted puddle!

394
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:49,860
Real.

395
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
Haunted puddle real.

396
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,620
I caught some people walking through the woods around the house last week.

397
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,540
Not kids.

398
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,900
Just regular adults.

399
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,980
I don't think they're regular then.

400
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,280
They told me they got lost while hiking.

401
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,180
I pointed them back towards the road.

402
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,060
The whole thing just didn't feel right.

403
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,880
I think I should go dig up Bob's rifle out of storage.

404
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,860
Where am I?

405
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,800
Oh, the puddle is not important.

406
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,680
It's important enough to be put on the map, I guess.

407
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,080
Gary loves you.

408
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,140
Another house.

409
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,480
Oh my goodness.

410
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,100
The Martin's house lies about 100 yards off of Snake Meadow Hill Road.

411
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,940
There is almost no driveway.

412
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,860
Trees jut out in the middle of a gravel path that is mostly covered in grass.

413
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,920
It was difficult to find the house, especially since it was already dark when we arrived.

414
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,180
Father Allred seemed to know where he was going.

415
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,600
He simply drove straight ahead until we arrived at the house.

416
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,020
In the headlights, I saw an old shed off to the right of the path.

417
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,000
Father Allred explained that he would rather perform the exorcism away from the house.

418
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,900
But the Martin's had insisted that Amy remain inside.

419
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:19,320
He complained that having the family present makes it difficult to proceed with elements of the rite that may seem harsh to the layperson.

420
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,700
Lockpicking stream would be interesting to see as I am a locksmith.

421
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,320
Really?

422
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,620
Well, I'd want to get... Like I said, I'd want to get certified first.

423
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,480
Certify...

424
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,400
Freak.

425
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,700
7 days a week.

426
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,040
Spoopy Atari game.

427
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,440
Can't wait for the 31st.

428
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,480
Me too!

429
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,380
Thanks Chucky!

430
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,120
That was a close one, wasn't it?

431
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,880
Now how do I get back?

432
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,580
Quickdraw.

433
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,580
Deer.

434
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,300
I bet the wells...

435
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,900
I hope it's not that way.

436
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,780
What is this?

437
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,720
You can get transparent locks to practice with at home.

438
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,680
They're really fun to play with.

439
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,400
Really?

440
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,560
Bob, the kids and I miss you more every day.

441
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,600
The twins and Amy have started their next school year here at home.

442
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,280
Amy keeps asking when she's going to be allowed to go to real school.

443
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,920
Real school.

444
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,320
I think she's getting cabin fever.

445
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,520
The twins are having no problems occupying their time.

446
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,440
Yesterday they came in with their hands covered in blood.

447
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,140
Oh my god!

448
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,620
Oh my god!

449
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,660
Oh those silly twins.

450
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,620
Oh David and Eli.

451
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,720
They're just running around covering their hands in blood.

452
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,320
Silly silliness.

453
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,380
Yeah, you know how kids are.

454
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,340
Gosh.

455
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,120
Have I ever told you guys?

456
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,660
One time I was at a store.

457
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,980
And I was just browsing.

458
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,720
This was quite recent actually.

459
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,360
Like a couple months ago.

460
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,860
I was just browsing.

461
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,480
There was like a dad and his two kids that were nearby.

462
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,320
And they were like looking at stuff near me.

463
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,860
And then I hear the dad say...

464
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,640
Come on, let's go Dave and Eli.

465
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,040
And I was...

466
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,400
It was like a fight or flight reaction.

467
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,880
It wasn't David.

468
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,640
It was Dave.

469
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,620
But I was like no.

470
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,460
There's no way.

471
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:07,600
There's actually no way that these two kids next to me were named Dave and Eli.

472
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,120
They're right.

473
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,820
But like what are the chances?

474
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,000
What are the chances?

475
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,220
Right?

476
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,620
It took me a minute.

477
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,140
My brain immediately activated.

478
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,460
I just asked that dad.

479
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:30,800
No.

480
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,120
I couldn't imagine just like...

481
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
Are your children Metal Gear children?

482
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,550
Do you think they're younger than MGSV?

483
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,710
When did that come out?

484
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,610
When did that come out?

485
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,430
They were probably like 7.

486
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,830
Does that make the dad a big boss?

487
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,670
I think so.

488
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,910
It's been 9 years?

489
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,000
Insane.

490
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,100
Should've asked if the children were terrible.

491
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,140
The twins are having no problems occupying their time.

492
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,720
Yesterday they came in with their hands covered in blood.

493
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,220
I guess they found a dead deer and thought it would be a good idea to touch it.

494
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,340
I think we might have a coyote problem because...

495
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:35,860
When I went out with them to look at the dead deer, it was a pretty gruesome sight.

496
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,220
All this just a day after the twins' birthday party.

497
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,300
Can't wait till you come home.

498
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,700
Oh, I thought he was dead.

499
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,040
Did you know your kids are a Metal Gear reference?

500
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,160
Don't come this way.

501
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,440
Hey deer, can you lead me to the well, please?

502
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,340
This way?

503
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,060
OK.

504
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,880
Where is the well?

505
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:11,840
Deer?

506
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,060
Where is the well?

507
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:18,760
Won't you be a deer and take me to the well, please?

508
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,280
Be a deer.

509
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,780
Oh gosh!

510
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,040
Hey!

511
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,800
Oh, this is... OK.

512
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,160
So we need to go up.

513
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,060
OK.

514
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,240
Thanks, deer.

515
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:54,750
Dead tree.

516
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:55,970
Oh, we found something new though.

517
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,610
This is good.

518
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,410
Ghost tree.

519
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,930
Today I noticed Amy's favorite tree looks like it's dying.

520
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,590
All the needles are falling off of it.

521
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,370
Off it and the bark is peeling.

522
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:20,650
I saw a clip from a reality TV show of some guy who wanted to name his kids after Elden Ring bosses.

523
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,930
I mean, there's children named Sephiroth out there.

524
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,430
Just think about that.

525
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,610
I guess I'm more upset about it than Amy is.

526
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,310
She's totally absorbed in her volunteer work at the clinic.

527
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,490
I guess it's good that she found something she's passionate about.

528
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:43,010
But I've gotten really... I've gotten ugly looks from some of the women at book club.

529
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:43,750
What?

530
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:48,210
Cathy and her religious friends won't even talk to me anymore.

531
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,530
She's volunteering at a clinic!

532
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,350
What is the issue?

533
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,210
Father Sephiroth.

534
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,820
What's wrong with it?

535
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,440
She's at a clinic!

536
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,720
Haunted blood.

537
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,220
Just kidding.

538
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,200
It talks.

539
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,920
I understand now.

540
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,060
Chaos reigns.

541
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,160
I'm lost again you guys.

542
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:32,740
Oh no.

543
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,780
I think I need to go over one.

544
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,400
I think he went after... We found it!

545
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,720
Let's go.

546
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,040
He keeps trying to get me, but I'm too fast.

547
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,180
I'm a speedy guy.

548
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:01,080
Too fast for you.

549
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,320
Let's go.

550
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,640
Enter the house.

551
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
It's an achievement I got.

552
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,800
Mr. and Mrs. Martin greeted us at the front porch.

553
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:31,580
Mr. Martin led us downstairs to the basement, explaining that Amy was down there in restraint.

554
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,260
I felt for him.

555
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,900
There was guilt and shame in his voice.

556
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,780
Amy was in the very back of the attic in a...

557
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,240
Wait, huh?

558
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,300
I thought Amy was in the basement.

559
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:54,380
Amy was in the very back of the attic in a chair, perfectly calm, staring at us.

560
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,700
It is hard to describe the look on her face.

561
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,980
It was not the kind of look a child gives you.

562
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,680
Freaky kid.

563
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,660
Such a sweet family.

564
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,700
Where are your twins though?

565
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,260
They hate the twins.

566
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,100
David and Eli...

567
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,000
They suck.

568
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,460
It's really quiet in here guys.

569
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,120
It's a sunny day.

570
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,820
It's a beautiful day.

571
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,580
Whatever this is, we don't care about it.

572
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,240
Cute.

573
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,380
I want a nice picture.

574
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,400
We can't go outside.

575
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,520
It's really quiet.

576
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,660
Haunted plant!

577
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,380
It's been a long time since I've played this game, so I can't quite remember all the stuff.

578
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,340
So...

579
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,920
I'll do my best.

580
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,360
Haunted mirror!

581
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,220
Oh my gosh, there is something behind me!

582
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,540
Haunted bed!

583
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,540
This bed needs to be christened.

584
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,480
Haunted dresser.

585
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,120
Okay, let's go upstairs.

586
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:27,480
Wait.

587
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,000
I have to have faith.

588
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,660
I know, gosh, the atmosphere in this is too good.

589
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,660
It freaks me out.

590
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,880
It's too good, because it's just...

591
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,540
The lack of atmosphere is everything, you know what I mean?

592
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,320
You don't need the atmosphere.

593
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,460
You don't need all the scary music.

594
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,120
Freaky toys!

595
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,980
This one is haunted.

596
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,520
No.

597
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,120
Okay.

598
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,740
We're fine.

599
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,580
Everything is good.

600
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,420
Oh, that freaky ghost.

601
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:17,280
Bob must be stationed somewhere in the Middle East, because he sent over this weird looking doll for Amy's birthday.

602
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,060
I'll ask Anisha about it next time we have book club.

603
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,760
She looks like she could be from over there.

604
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,000
Okay, we're assuming.

605
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,860
Amy didn't seem excited to see the doll.

606
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,340
I think she would rather have a phone instead.

607
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,820
Or maybe seeing a baby doll makes her feel self-conscious about working at the clinic.

608
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,840
I guess I was the only one who thought to check in the attic.

609
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,840
When I got up there, it was freezing cold.

610
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,720
First sign of a ghost!

611
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,320
First sign of a ghost.

612
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,560
I found Amy standing in the back, looking straight at me, like when I first met her downstairs.

613
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,960
Beware the temptation.

614
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
What temptation?

615
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,690
The serpent?

616
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,220
And it's venom will send you an inescapable curse of brain rot?

617
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,980
I have too much brain rot.

618
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,200
Too much brain rot.

619
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,080
First ghost, bottom right.

620
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,140
Pazuzu doll!

621
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,540
Oh my gosh, my icon!

622
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,940
Pazuzu.

623
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,020
Well, we spoke briefly, although it was frustrating to talk to her.

624
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,100
Or it.

625
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,260
I experienced a bit of deception from the demon.

626
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:54,640
During our conversation, she uttered my mother's first name and in other instances, spoke perfect Latin.

627
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,200
I called for help from the others, but nobody came.

628
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,700
So I raised my crucifix and began the rite again.

629
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,180
That's the rite.

630
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,370
Haunted Ducky!

631
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,530
Good luck with the busting.

632
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:28,330
Thank you!

633
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,290
I don't feel safe in my own home anymore.

634
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,890
I hear voices outside around the house at night.

635
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:39,090
I don't let the twins go out in the woods to play because I'm afraid of what's out there.

636
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,870
The house itself feels stressed, distorted, slanted somehow.

637
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,510
It's like I'm walking through a carnival funhouse.

638
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,890
Amy's condition has only gotten worse.

639
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:54,270
I can't stand to be around her and I don't know why.

640
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,670
She just doesn't seem like herself anymore.

641
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,890
I want to take her to the doctor, but I can't leave the boys here.

642
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,370
I find that the phone stops working throughout the day.

643
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,550
And now I can't seem to find my car keys!

644
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,870
Thank god Bob comes home tomorrow.

645
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,230
The power of Minto compels you!

646
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,590
OK, we had this door over here.

647
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,410
Oh, I don't think... OK, we gotta go into the basement first.

648
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,030
Alrighty, righty!

649
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,830
DORIME!

650
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:33,130
Does anybody remember DORIME?

651
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,770
I don't remember how.

652
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,670
I just remember the DORIME part.

653
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:39,990
Sorry.

654
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,470
Into the basement!

655
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,330
Don't like that.

656
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,890
D-d-d-dum!

657
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,750
D-d-d-dum!

658
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:58,970
With my cross I'm all powerful!

659
00:41:59,690 --> 00:41:59,830
Oh.

660
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:00,530
Oh!

661
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,330
Haunted...

662
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,670
Haunted bench.

663
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,110
Dear Amy, thanks for writing!

664
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,170
It really brightened my day hearing from you.

665
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:12,590
In your letter you asked, what's the weirdest thing I've seen as a missionary.

666
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,870
The area we are working in has a lot of folks who practice...

667
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,670
Quim-bamba.

668
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,550
It's what you might call a pagan religion.

669
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,030
It's kind of a mix of Catholic and African religions.

670
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,350
One of the saints they worship is San La Muerte.

671
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,630
Or Saint Death.

672
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:32,650
Hi ghost lady.

673
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,210
Hello!

674
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,270
Yesterday we talked to a boy about 15.

675
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:46,670
When we asked him if he had ever prayed, he said, No, but I have prayed to San La Muerte.

676
00:42:47,970 --> 00:43:00,370
He told us about a time when he stayed over at his cousin's house and according to him, they prayed to some figures of San La Muerte and the figures made things in the house move around!

677
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,650
He got real quiet and scared looking after that.

678
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:12,270
We told him he could pray to God and that God wouldn't make him feel scared like that.

679
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:16,570
We invited him to church, but he hasn't come yet.

680
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,090
I need to wrap this letter up and get back to work.

681
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:24,690
He prayed.

682
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,650
He never prayed, but he prayed.

683
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,890
He's busy.

684
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:35,810
Yeah, this is a busy guy.

685
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,050
I gotta get back to work now.

686
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:37,410
Girl!

687
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,170
See you in 4 months!

688
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:39,950
Layton.

689
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,470
Of the Professor variety or Haunted Laundry.

690
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:45,670
Haunted Puddle.

691
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:46,670
No Haunted Puddle.

692
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,890
Making my way.

693
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,430
Oh, I don't like those.

694
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,930
I don't like those at all.

695
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,590
Making my way through the basement.

696
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,250
Freaked out by all the mannequins.

697
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,170
Oh, let's get this first.

698
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:10,030
Amy's parents could not endure witnessing the proceedings of the rite for long.

699
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:16,150
Mrs. Martin was hysterical, and the thing that was inside Amy was feeding off of the fear.

700
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:19,950
Father Allred asked me to take the Martins upstairs.

701
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,350
I was physically worn out, but managed to get them back up the stairs.

702
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:25,590
Into the kitchen.

703
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,390
Amy was screaming, Mother!

704
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:27,810
Mother!

705
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:29,130
The whole time.

706
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:32,590
Finally, I got them to sit down with me at the kitchen table.

707
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:38,490
After a few minutes, we couldn't hear much of anything down in the basement, so I went down to check on things.

708
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:44,730
I found Father Allred lying on his back, unconscious, with his arms spread out wide.

709
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:48,110
Amy was not in the chair.

710
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,580
That can't be good.

711
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,500
I don't think so.

712
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,640
Oh boy.

713
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,580
Good morning meantime!

714
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:02,820
No!

715
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,680
Oh my gosh.

716
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,940
No, I didn't mean to skip it.

717
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,700
No!

718
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,700
I was holding up my cross.

719
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:11,520
No!

720
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,000
I'm so sorry you guys.

721
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,580
I'm so sorry.

722
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,160
I forgot that skip is now space.

723
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,560
Apparently that's a new thing.

724
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,180
She is here!

725
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:28,260
Ah!

726
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,740
Ah!

727
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,260
Oh, I got her immediately.

728
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:34,860
Nice.

729
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,860
Okay, so we need to go back.

730
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,480
We need to somehow find the...

731
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,800
Can we go in here yet?

732
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:49,820
No.

733
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,940
We need to find the key.

734
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,220
Exercise the cutscene.

735
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,940
I was just trying to hold up my...

736
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,920
my cross.

737
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,280
Die for the first time?

738
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,990
Big Pazuzu, come in.

739
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,010
Kazuhiro Miller.

740
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:23,750
How did I die?

741
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:24,470
Oh, here we go.

742
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,590
We get to see her for real now.

743
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:27,770
Mortis.

744
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,490
She is here!

745
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,810
Do I go grab the gun?

746
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,030
I'm trying to remember what to do here.

747
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,150
I'm too fast for you.

748
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:49,570
I'm too fast for you.

749
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,080
How did she catch me though?

750
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,340
That was so close.

751
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,500
I saw her little prints on the carpet.

752
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,050
It's hard to see though.

753
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:11,150
Maybe that's what I missed before and she got on top of me.

754
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:15,650
Run, run, run!

755
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:20,230
Run, run.

756
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:20,570
Oh!

757
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:25,850
Got her.

758
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:28,030
Got her.

759
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:28,690
Can I...

760
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:32,630
Ok, I can't change direction when I have the cross on.

761
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:34,430
Oh, I see her.

762
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:37,070
I see her coming.

763
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:38,550
Do I need to be down here?

764
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:40,630
Or am I crazy?

765
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,830
I don't think I need to be down here.

766
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:44,590
Ma'am!

767
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:44,810
Ma'am!

768
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:47,810
Ma'am!

769
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,770
You gotta commit.

770
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:53,550
I gotta commit to whatever.

771
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,110
Can I get to that sewing machine?

772
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,810
Oh my god!

773
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,370
That was so close!

774
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:03,290
Holy moly!

775
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,450
Oh no, there is nothing here.

776
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:06,730
Ok.

777
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:09,890
That was so close.

778
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:12,990
We got this.

779
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:15,990
Um, though...

780
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:16,730
I'm running.

781
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,230
I didn't even know she was there.

782
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:25,830
I just thought it was the manne...

783
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,710
I was like that mannequin is looking awfully sus.

784
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,450
It's my sixth sense!

785
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,310
She can't fool a ghost.

786
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:33,570
Mammy!

787
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:35,230
Do I leave now?

788
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:39,030
No!

789
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:40,550
Mortis!

790
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:44,890
Dang it.

791
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:47,410
Mortis.

792
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:48,690
The carpet is murder.

793
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,030
For real, actually!

794
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,770
If I get too close to the door, will she kill me?

795
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,420
She is here.

796
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,060
Well, I need to poop.

797
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,120
Oh, so does she apparently.

798
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,100
Holy cow!

799
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,590
You failed me?

800
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:28,610
She is here.

801
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:37,450
Forsaken!

802
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:37,790
Forsaken?

803
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:42,050
I don't remember this part, you guys.

804
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,670
Goodness gracious.

805
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:49,490
Sometimes she is so close.

806
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:53,650
Mammy!

807
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,470
Is it in here?

808
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,140
Look at me.

809
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,640
We got it!

810
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,060
We got it!

811
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:12,600
We got it!

812
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,340
I think I need to exorcise her in like a bunch of the rooms.

813
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,100
OK, nice.

814
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,740
Does that mean she is gone?

815
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,200
There is no music anymore.

816
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,100
Am I safe?

817
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,140
Am I safe?

818
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,780
Door-tis.

819
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,260
OK.

820
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:30,560
Alright.

821
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:33,860
Alright.

822
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,140
Alright.

823
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,720
To the attic we go.

824
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,740
Oh my gosh.

825
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,240
I love this episode of Mad Libs.

826
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,480
It's literally like Clue.

827
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,400
Where is she?

828
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,180
In the candlestick?

829
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,360
In the kitchen?

830
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,580
When I confronted her, she...

831
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,500
Managed to cut the power to the house and...

832
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,320
Her own parents.

833
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,360
With their own...

834
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,760
Oh my goodness.

835
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,720
I have to go back to that house.

836
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,680
The nightmares I'm having are real.

837
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,660
She is still there waiting for me.

838
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,260
I can still help her.

839
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,060
If I don't come back, know that I love you and I'm sorry.

840
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,240
John.

841
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,080
Safe.

842
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,100
Save.

843
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,120
What happened to you?

844
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,140
Do you think my face is pretty?

845
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,120
I have to finish what I started.

846
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,640
She's been alone?

847
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,980
Possessed by a demon?

848
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,460
For a year?

849
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,260
What do you mean what happened to your face?

850
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,980
What's wrong with your face?

851
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,480
What's that guy?

852
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,340
Oh don't skip.

853
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,120
What's wrong with your face?

854
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:41,980
Time...

855
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,300
Got her.

856
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:53,880
Mortis.

857
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,940
The rotoscope parts are just too cool.

858
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,140
Why was I facing the wrong way?

859
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,820
Do I have to dodge?

860
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,820
Do I dodge instead?

861
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,930
And I'll getcha!

862
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,560
And I'll getcha!

863
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:41,430
And I'll getcha!

864
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:45,390
Oh nice.

865
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,210
And I'll getcha!

866
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,610
Oh, where is she?

867
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:56,890
And I'll getcha!

868
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:04,450
And I'll getcha!

869
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:08,110
Wait a...

870
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:09,650
Round 2!

871
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:11,330
Oh my gosh.

872
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,110
I don't remember how to do this part.

873
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:16,010
Oh my goodness.

874
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:21,610
Mortis.

875
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:25,230
Oopsie.

876
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:30,470
At least they are nice enough to give you this checkpoint.

877
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:32,310
You know?

878
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,670
I don't think she is able to be touched here.

879
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:42,920
Oh my goodness.

880
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,660
Oh, she can be touched.

881
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,020
Nevermind.

882
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:47,920
Dang it.

883
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,240
OK.

884
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,640
We got this.

885
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,160
We got this.

886
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,180
No worries.

887
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,320
Don't touch me.

888
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,080
Don't touch me.

889
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,100
Don't touch me.

890
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:56,840
Oh.

891
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:02,960
More.

892
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,800
I can't dodge.

893
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,900
Wait, can she touch me here?

894
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:12,360
Hold on.

895
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,200
I'm going to experiment.

896
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,440
Oh.

897
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:15,580
OK.

898
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,140
Well, that's not exactly what I was trying to see.

899
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:18,860
More.

900
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,700
Hurt me mortis.

901
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,320
Like, this is what I want to see.

902
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:23,680
OK.

903
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:23,920
OK.

904
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,700
I got it now.

905
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:28,900
Acquired a ticket.

906
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:32,040
Help me get some time to do some 3AM Waffle House.

907
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,060
Oh boy.

908
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,680
I'm going to get beat up at the Waffle House.

909
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,960
Or see some of Atlanta's scenic tumbleweaves.

910
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:41,960
Like the desert?

911
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,250
Isn't that a tumble wave?

912
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:51,870
I'm scared.

913
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:53,130
I'm going to...

914
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,890
I'm scared of when she starts coming at me.

915
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:59,990
She goes in the same way every time, but...

916
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:00,450
Oh my gosh.

917
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:09,790
Sorry guys, I'm not very good at this part.

918
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:11,890
I'm not very good at this.

919
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:14,090
I think I'm struggling a little bit.

920
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:16,110
I don't know how to draw a star apparently.

921
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:21,270
Oh gosh.

922
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,170
I don't know how to draw a star.

923
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,760
And I'm kind of slow.

924
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,580
And she is really fast.

925
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:37,150
More.

926
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:40,930
OK.

927
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:41,910
OK.

928
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:44,150
We got to the third point.

929
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,170
So maybe we will be alright.

930
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:48,690
OK.

931
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:50,310
Then she starts going.

932
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:51,190
Oh no.

933
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:52,210
Oh my gosh.

934
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:52,810
I was so close.

935
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,910
Guys, I was so close.

936
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:57,570
And I can't be... Oh, in the circle.

937
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:57,630
Circle.

938
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,110
That she creates.

939
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:03,530
She is bleeding.

940
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:04,270
She is bleeding.

941
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,640
I give up.

942
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,220
I got run over by a man.

943
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,240
This part is scary.

944
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,280
Where did that guy come from?

945
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,660
The pattern is the pentagram.

946
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,660
I know, but I can't... I don't know how to draw a star.

947
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,860
And it's upside down.

948
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,500
So it's kind of like...

949
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:54,620
Freaky.

950
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,080
And then she goes down in the middle.

951
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,600
And then she goes over.

952
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,680
And I can attack.

953
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,160
I don't know.

954
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,140
From here I'm lost.

955
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:13,960
And then she goes up.

956
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:15,440
And then I can attack.

957
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:18,680
Oh goodness.

958
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:19,660
Oh goodness.

959
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,060
Oh goodness.

960
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:21,860
Is it here?

961
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,100
Oh god.

962
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:27,970
OK.

963
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:29,170
OK.

964
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:34,390
Mortis.

965
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,620
Who just gifted?

966
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:44,620
Jobless?

967
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,220
Don't gift if you are jobless.

968
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,940
Thanks for the five gifted though.

969
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,260
But don't do it if you are jobless.

970
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,740
Take care of yourself.

971
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:54,780
Thank goodness.

972
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,360
Oh my goodness.

973
00:58:59,140 --> 00:58:59,860
Oh my god.

974
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,680
I wasn't aligned.

975
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,460
Guys, I'm so sorry.

976
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,540
I'm really bad at this part.

977
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,420
Can I just like chill here?

978
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,160
Oh OK.

979
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:15,600
I'm not...

980
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,040
I'm too far away.

981
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:17,780
Dang it!

982
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:19,420
No!

983
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,140
Where is she coming down?

984
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:25,470
OK.

985
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,650
This is not going so high, but that's OK.

986
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:29,410
And then she's going to go over here.

987
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,010
OK.

988
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:42,270
Shoot.

989
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:44,310
And then over here.

990
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,240
Where did she stop?

991
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:02,340
Oh.

992
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,480
She was waiting for me.

993
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:13,170
Did she go in the middle?

994
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:15,350
OK.

995
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,330
Now she's just repeating.

996
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:24,130
Oh my gosh.

997
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:24,430
Please.

998
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:25,750
I wasn't aligned.

999
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:28,650
Which means now she'll go up here.

1000
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:48,930
That guy's got a little face on him now.

1001
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:51,210
The crosses are back to normal.

1002
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:52,790
OK.

1003
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:58,010
She ran outside, so we're safe.

1004
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,110
Nice fight, Mito.

1005
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:05,630
Thank you.

1006
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,690
Kill her.

1007
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:13,930
Thank you.

1008
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:15,250
What do you mean thank you?

1009
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,730
Lembas takes you three months.

1010
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:22,970
Lick.

1011
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,020
Shoot the mirror.

1012
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,880
I've never seen that ending.

1013
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,240
Does it actually shoot?

1014
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,600
Does it actually work?

1015
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,360
One shot.

1016
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,460
It does.

1017
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,920
The mirror works.

1018
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,620
I don't think I remember...

1019
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:03,840
Wait.

1020
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:04,980
Can I go back inside?

1021
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,020
OK.

1022
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:06,220
Good.

1023
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,040
Shrimp!

1024
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,340
Thanks for the five gifted.

1025
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,840
Was it upstairs or downstairs?

1026
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:15,940
It's a secret.

1027
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:16,960
Shoot the mirror.

1028
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,900
I don't think I've ever seen it before.

1029
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,180
There was a thing behind me.

1030
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,080
Wait,

1031
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,100
it gives me another gun.

1032
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,060
Eating Mike Tyson's...

1033
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,040
Thanks for the five gifted.

1034
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,960
Do it again?

1035
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:41,460
OK.

1036
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:45,330
Thanks guys.

1037
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,770
I had no idea about this.

1038
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,230
Thanks for the five gifted.

1039
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:53,570
OK, let's try it again.

1040
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:54,130
Let's try it again.

1041
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:56,390
A gun with one bullet.

1042
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:57,310
Bullet.

1043
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:59,630
A gun with one bullet.

1044
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:00,750
OK.

1045
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,880
I don't like this.

1046
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,760
Why did you...What's wrong with you guys?

1047
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,440
Wait, why did you send me here?

1048
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:55,310
I'm not lined up.

1049
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,980
I hate when I'm not facing the right direction.

1050
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:10,840
Come!

1051
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,320
I did...

1052
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:21,080
Find and defeat the secret boss of chapter one.

1053
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,680
Oh my god, scary!

1054
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:27,640
Scary!

1055
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:30,100
You guys should have warned me!

1056
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,280
Oh my gosh!

1057
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,180
October 23rd.

1058
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:39,660
That was yesterday!

1059
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,280
1986.

1060
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:46,340
Dear Dr. Mcglashon.

1061
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,340
It has been 30 days since the beginning of my treatment here at Yale Psychiatric Institute.

1062
01:04:53,160 --> 01:05:03,960
Dr. Spinell, who has been so patient with me, has helped me understand my afflictions and has helped me find a way to move forward and accept the truth.

1063
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:17,040
With Dr. Spinell's help, I have come to accept what really happened in September at the Martin family residence.

1064
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:32,940
I accept that what happened was not the result of any supernatural phenomenon, but rather the desperate actions of a young girl driven to violence by her dogmatic parents and old church rituals that are thought to drive out evil.

1065
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:43,560
I am happy to report that since accepting the truth, my nightmares have ceased and I now enjoy peace of mind that I have not felt since the incident.

1066
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:56,360
Given my progress since first coming here, I respectfully request my release from Yale Psychiatric Institute, contingent upon follow-up appointments with Dr. Spinell in the future.

1067
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:01,180
Sincerely, John Ward I think he's a liar!

1068
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,340
You liar!

1069
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,820
Can we go back in there?

1070
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,480
Excuse me.

1071
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,440
There's no reflection.

1072
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,680
John Faith!

1073
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:23,300
A gun with one bullet.

1074
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,520
What should I kill?

1075
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,360
Her?

1076
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,460
I guess I have to.

1077
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:44,260
At this point she's probably just like a rotting corpse, right?

1078
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:48,880
Hello?

1079
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:49,700
Hello?

1080
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:50,620
Hello?

1081
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,120
Hello?

1082
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,040
Is anybody...

1083
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,400
I was going to say alive, but...

1084
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:57,960
I'm so scared.

1085
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:58,760
Don't be scared!

1086
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:01,080
Happy six months.

1087
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,400
Thanks for the six months!

1088
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:03,820
Hunt the deer?

1089
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:05,400
Hello?

1090
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:05,860
Hello?

1091
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:06,340
Hello?

1092
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:06,740
Hello?

1093
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,960
Is any...

1094
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,620
Who is that?

1095
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,680
I always shoot first.

1096
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,180
Ask questions later.

1097
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,520
Get off my property.

1098
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,420
Who is that?

1099
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,140
I think I can get another gun.

1100
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,400
I'll hunt down every damn thing in this forest.

1101
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:52,640
Even if it's the last thing I do.

1102
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,740
Wait, this looks like a trail.

1103
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:12,080
I think I...

1104
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:15,120
I commit to my actions.

1105
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,100
I commit to my actions!

1106
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,020
I commit to my actions!

1107
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,120
I commit to my actions!

1108
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:33,310
We're fine.

1109
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:34,170
Probably.

1110
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,290
Yeah, it's time to get out of here.

1111
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:37,190
Let's go back home.

1112
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,510
John Faith waddles off into the sunset.

1113
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,250
Who is that guy?

1114
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:47,750
Probably the bad guy.

1115
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:50,550
Probably.

1116
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:07,310
Oopsie.

1117
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:08,610
I shall not be afraid.

1118
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:12,230
Two of five.

1119
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:14,290
Father and son.

1120
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:45,090
I fight against the enemy at such a critical time.

1121
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:51,970
There is another reason why I dare not return Michael to his family, nor let them see him.

1122
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:58,590
The darkness inside him afflicts his soul, but it also causes a terrible strain on his body.

1123
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:07,210
So that there may be no mistaking what I mean, I have enclosed a photograph of young Michael during one of our sessions.

1124
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:09,490
The photograph is missing.

1125
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,160
New background, new effect and new play mode.

1126
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,720
What did I do?

1127
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,160
I didn't do anything.

1128
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,520
Welcome to membership.

1129
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,180
Thank you!

1130
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,660
Should we try for... I don't have to play the whole game again to get the other endings, right?

1131
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,300
Welcome back!

1132
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:48,720
Thank you!

1133
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,300
It's saved at the end?

1134
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:53,760
OK, cool.

1135
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:59,320
What I started...

1136
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:04,740
Has not been approved by the Vatican!

1137
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:06,740
I said the thing!

1138
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,560
The 21st of September?

1139
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:41,130
21st of September Do you remember?

1140
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:58,190
21st of September Do you remember the 21st?

1141
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:05,190
Alright, so...

1142
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:07,270
I have begin, but I don't have a continue.

1143
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:08,950
Maybe if I click begin.

1144
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:09,990
What's the extras though?

1145
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:11,630
It said I got a new play mode.

1146
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:12,770
Oh, replay intro.

1147
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:17,730
Conjuration mode, coming soon.

1148
01:12:19,390 --> 01:12:20,350
Survival mode.

1149
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:27,610
Chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3.

1150
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:29,170
Who's this one?

1151
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:30,670
Chapter 3?

1152
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:38,730
Just saying it like that, 119 more times.

1153
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:40,090
Oh,

1154
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:44,310
chapter...

1155
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:45,190
Oh, that's right!

1156
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:48,550
I was thinking, like, when it saves.

1157
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:49,410
You're so right.

1158
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:54,470
I don't have the backgrounds enabled, but I want to see what the other background is that we got.

1159
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:56,230
Oh, it's this one!

1160
01:12:57,610 --> 01:13:00,110
I'm kind of covering it, it's kind of moved over.

1161
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:02,210
I feel like the backgrounds...

1162
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:06,570
I don't want to say ruin the vibes, but...

1163
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:12,210
Like, I don't want to see anime priests...

1164
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:16,790
While I'm... You know?

1165
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:19,210
Like, it's just kind of...

1166
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,180
This is so funny.

1167
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,100
Chapter 1.

1168
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,600
We got 8 out of 20?

1169
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,860
There's so many notes!

1170
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,880
Oh no, sorry, 18 out of 20.

1171
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,180
I was going to say, wowie.

1172
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:33,980
Okay.

1173
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:39,140
When can we expect to play HuniePop?

1174
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,260
I don't know, I've played HuniePop before.

1175
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,440
A gun with one bullet.

1176
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:49,180
Seriously, Salvo, welcome to...

1177
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,060
Mambo Ship.

1178
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:01,870
Wait, all these trees, where did they come from?

1179
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:02,470
I just noticed.

1180
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:08,010
I'm so happy my first in-person concert gets to be you and Doki.

1181
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:11,750
The venue is only a 5-hour drive from me, so I pulled the trigger this morning and committed.

1182
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:13,230
Wow, Pac-Man!

1183
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:14,330
Thank you!

1184
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:16,050
Oh my gosh, see you there!

1185
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:20,810
Just curious, do you do the goofy scream intentionally or does it come out naturally?

1186
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:24,870
What's goofy about my scream?

1187
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:25,670
What do you mean?

1188
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:33,550
I think I found her.

1189
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:36,470
My scream isn't that goofy!

1190
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:38,810
Is it?

1191
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:48,770
That's a weird tree.

1192
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:52,150
Isn't there a deer that I can shoot?

1193
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:56,110
What if I get really close to her?

1194
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:56,870
Ma'am?

1195
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:00,810
Put your hands up.

1196
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,350
Why are her arms like that?

1197
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:06,170
Oh

1198
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:12,850
my gosh.

1199
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:23,790
We love Goofy Minto screams.

1200
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:36,270
I mean Disney Goofy.

1201
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:41,610
Disney Goofy scream.

1202
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:43,610
Where he goes like...

1203
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:47,450
How does a Goofy scream sound like?

1204
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:51,450
That one?

1205
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:11,130
Every time I think of Goofy screams, sometimes my brain inputs the...

1206
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:15,890
The Wilhelm scream instead.

1207
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:29,210
It's this guy!

1208
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:30,410
What if we go talk to him?

1209
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:31,910
Ok, who are you?

1210
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:33,890
Hey, who are you mister?

1211
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:42,070
Oh my god, I didn't actually expect him to respond.

1212
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:48,730
Greetings from Hakone!

1213
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:55,630
There is a great juxtaposition with this stream and my Ryokan playing calming piano music in the dining hall.

1214
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:57,690
Are you forcing everybody to listen?

1215
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:03,050
Oh,

1216
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:08,030
I found the deer.

1217
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:09,610
Ok, don't run, don't run.

1218
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:12,570
If I get close to it, it will run, right?

1219
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:15,090
If I get close to it, it will run.

1220
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:23,030
You got scared of a guy with a shotgun, fair.

1221
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:23,650
True.

1222
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:30,190
Ok, I gotta line this up.

1223
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:32,430
Don't look up, deer.

1224
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,360
Ok, you go that way, I'll go this way.

1225
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,060
3 steps, turn around.

1226
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,120
It's gonna feel bad.

1227
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:51,340
It was right on top of him.

1228
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,320
You're a ghost and an exorcist?

1229
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:06,780
It's complicated.

1230
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,960
Is the deer gonna attack me this time?

1231
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:42,430
Oh my god, this is so brutal.

1232
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:45,150
Wait, we actually hit a tree, not the deer at all.

1233
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:52,720
4 of 5.

1234
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,000
The Hunter.

1235
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,080
Over the Hedge remake is getting pretty metal.

1236
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,880
Unidentified body discovered near wrecked car.

1237
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:08,520
The site of a deadly car accident was discovered along a road near Sterling this morning.

1238
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,560
Along with the body of a person who has not yet been identified.

1239
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:17,740
At 6am this morning, a resident called to report an accident along Snake Meadow Hill Road.

1240
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:22,080
The driver of a silver sedan has swerved off the road and struck a tree.

1241
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:33,480
A spokesman for the police commented that the body appeared to have been dragged several yards away from the car deeper into the woods after having been ejected from the front windshield.

1242
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,760
It was noted that the body had been mangled beyond recognition.

1243
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,480
Investigators suspect this was probably the work of coyotes.

1244
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:52,440
Police also noted that parts of a cleaned white-tailed deer were found in the trunk of the car.

1245
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:59,060
From a white-tailed deer, a hunter typically gets 75 pounds of meat.

1246
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:05,320
However, it appears that the victim of the accident was only able to carry 25 pounds back to the car.

1247
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,740
Oh, is it Oregon Trail reference?

1248
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:11,660
Mortis.

1249
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:12,800
Bambi's Revenge.

1250
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:13,320
Real.

1251
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:15,800
Oh, that's so funny.

1252
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,360
Okay, let's get the other endings.

1253
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:29,830
Dysentery.

1254
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,750
A gun with one bullet.

1255
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:39,590
Okay, what are the other two endings though?

1256
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:43,550
We got the one with the guy, we got the one with the deer, and I know where she is.

1257
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:46,890
What other endings could there be?

1258
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:50,070
Except if there's five.

1259
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:53,290
American emphasis on coyote.

1260
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:54,650
A coyote.

1261
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:08,940
Find the squirrel?

1262
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,160
There's a squirrel.

1263
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,780
We love rain of spiders.

1264
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:14,540
Rain of spiders!

1265
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,760
Okay, I can just leave.

1266
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,660
It looks like from top down, it looks like a really long cigarette.

1267
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:23,340
Well, nevermind.

1268
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,920
I just shot the deer.

1269
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,580
I guess I can just leave since we are here.

1270
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:39,920
Let's try that one.

1271
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:51,480
Did he say...aww bummer.

1272
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,740
Oh father!

1273
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:53,860
Father!

1274
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:02,900
I thought he went...aww bummer!

1275
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:17,080
That's the guy that attacked me in the backseat.

1276
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:26,640
He's able to finish his little monologue.

1277
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,520
This is the canon ending.

1278
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,800
Ending 5 of 5, when faith endures.

1279
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:58,560
Alright.

1280
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,400
Oh, police.

1281
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:05,200
Animal experts investigate chupacabra remains found near Sterling.

1282
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:14,560
Sterling PD is enlisting the help of local animal experts from the University of Connecticut after the remains of an unidentified animal were found near Sterling.

1283
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:24,960
The remains of an animal, which some residents are calling a chupacabra, were discovered on Snake Meadow Hill Road by a motorist yesterday.

1284
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:30,540
The animal had apparently been struck by a vehicle and parts of its carcass were scattered across the road.

1285
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:38,880
Police say they initially investigated the gruesome scene because the motorist who discovered the remains had told them they appeared to be of a person.

1286
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,980
After arriving at the scene, the police concluded that the remains were of some kind of an animal.

1287
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:51,360
As a matter of public safety, we want to be sure about what exactly we're dealing with here, said a Sterling police spokesman.

1288
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:54,140
This is clearly not a deer or a coyote.

1289
01:23:54,500 --> 01:24:02,360
If it's a mountain lion or exotic pet that escapes from its owners or an animal with rabies, we need to know about it.

1290
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,220
Oh my gosh.

1291
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,020
Oh my gosh.

1292
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:10,660
You know what scares me so much is our like animal diseases.

1293
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:16,520
Okay, so like, have you guys seen like the neurological diseases that happen in like animals sometimes?

1294
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:23,640
Like, you'll see like deer that will like fall on their back and like just start like kicking in the air and things like that.

1295
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:26,640
And like...

1296
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:28,140
But they're so scary.

1297
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:29,800
They're so scary.

1298
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,480
Oh my gosh, rabies is so scary.

1299
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:33,600
Yeah, like the zombie deer.

1300
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1301
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,600
Oh my gosh, it's so sad.

1302
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:37,300
Prions!

1303
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:38,680
Yes!

1304
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:39,580
The prions!

1305
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:40,720
Oh my gosh.

1306
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,060
It's so scary.

1307
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:45,360
It's so scary.

1308
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,320
Oh my gosh, and then you have to kill them.

1309
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,580
You have to put them out of their misery and it's just so sad.

1310
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,080
It's so sad.

1311
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,880
Rabies though, if you get it, you like...

1312
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,980
I think once you know you have it, it's like too late or something, right?

1313
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,080
Humans, be careful, okay?

1314
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,520
Don't get rabies.

1315
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:15,500
Be careful.

1316
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:18,320
Be careful, okay?

1317
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,340
Stop petting squirrels and raccoons.

1318
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:23,980
Even if they're very fluffy and cute.

1319
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,120
I won't stop though.

1320
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,660
I think it was a kid?

1321
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:53,500
They literally described me.

1322
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:58,120
Hairless, anemic and suffering from a lack of vitamin D.

1323
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:02,100
Okay.

1324
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:03,440
Rude.

1325
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:12,600
Alright.

1326
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:14,460
Let's...

1327
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:15,820
I want to find the squirrel.

1328
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:23,380
Oh, it's only been an hour and a half.

1329
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:25,040
Okay, I think we can do episode 2 then.

1330
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:26,480
One bullet.

1331
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,820
Are you an otaku too?

1332
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:33,480
So what?

1333
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,680
It's an actual squirrel?

1334
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,360
Here in the woods that we have to find?

1335
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:39,740
Actual squirrel?

1336
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:47,020
What if one of the things you had to kill was actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf?

1337
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:50,440
Hairless where?

1338
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:51,700
What do you mean?

1339
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,180
Why are you asking that?

1340
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:57,540
I've seen him before.

1341
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:58,180
I have?

1342
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,500
The squirrel?

1343
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,260
I thought... or Shia LaBeouf.

1344
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:10,920
Excuse me.

1345
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,200
You're looking cute as always.

1346
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:17,740
Love the thumbnail.

1347
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:19,000
Thank you, Rodrigo.

1348
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,340
I love the thumbnail too.

1349
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:27,280
I remember when I first saw that picture I was like, I got to use that for Faith whenever I play it.

1350
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,240
Actual cannibal.

1351
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:31,440
Shia LaBeouf.

1352
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:33,680
You're lost in the woods.

1353
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,840
Whoa, Barry!

1354
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,120
Did it hurt when you fell from here?

1355
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,460
Oh no, I missed.

1356
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:41,080
Just shut up.

1357
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,340
Get out of here, Barry.

1358
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:44,940
What the hell?

1359
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,120
What are you doing here?

1360
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:51,600
Is this the squirrel?

1361
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,960
It looks kind of like a cat.

1362
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:55,660
This is the thing I shoot?

1363
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:06,170
It's a fox, but yes.

1364
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,320
I'm so sorry.

1365
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:22,360
His soul will be saved now.

1366
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,360
OK, I'm scared though.

1367
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:26,700
I've never seen this before.

1368
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:26,760
Yonder.

1369
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,020
Oh, that's grass.

1370
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:37,580
Oh, we're at the road.

1371
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,700
My car is...

1372
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,400
Over yonder.

1373
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:44,300
Yonder.

1374
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:52,800
Oh, here we go.

1375
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,520
Co-op, thanks for membership.

1376
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:55,580
You're welcome.

1377
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:58,280
Let's go.

1378
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:05,630
I have nothing to say this time?

1379
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:11,490
Oh my god!

1380
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:14,430
The cult?

1381
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:20,250
They're like you.

1382
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:22,330
The offering.

1383
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:23,970
I took their sacrifice.

1384
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:25,870
I took their sacrifice.

1385
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:26,950
Oh my gosh.

1386
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:29,330
Did I do that?

1387
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:30,550
Oh no!

1388
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:09,610
If there...

1389
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:13,250
Gary.

1390
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:15,350
I still consider you a part of the team.

1391
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:18,190
Even if your mom and dad do not.

1392
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:20,330
We hope to see you there.

1393
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:22,590
Gary.

1394
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:25,790
Gary.

1395
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:37,060
Rabies has a 99.9% survival rate.

1396
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,360
Non-survival rate.

1397
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:42,020
Do you hear them?

1398
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,180
Ah!

1399
01:30:55,010 --> 01:30:57,370
I think they're speaking Latin.

1400
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:19,780
Spooky!

1401
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:31,290
But...Paragon?

1402
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:33,150
I wish.

1403
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:38,510
Alright, last ending baby!

1404
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:47,780
Alright, we know where she's at.

1405
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,660
We know where she's at.

1406
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:50,740
Paragon.

1407
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:53,880
Paragon gun.

1408
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,100
Sorry.

1409
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:04,940
Does it come back?

1410
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:06,100
Yeah, ok.

1411
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:12,400
Paragon gun.

1412
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:13,520
Paragon bullet.

1413
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:14,920
Paragon shoot.

1414
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:16,040
Paragon demon.

1415
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,280
Alright, let's go kill a little girl.

1416
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:27,380
There we go.

1417
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:34,320
Thank goodness it respawns, right?

1418
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,960
Hey girl!

1419
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:45,480
Take

1420
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:50,870
that demon!

1421
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:52,170
Stupid demon!

1422
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:53,530
You have no vessel anymore!

1423
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,030
Idiot demon!

1424
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:57,410
Dummy dummy demon.

1425
01:32:58,050 --> 01:32:59,710
My car is...

1426
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:02,370
Yeah, we cured her.

1427
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:03,570
We cured her everybody.

1428
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,800
The fox is not here.

1429
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,380
That's kind of crazy.

1430
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:19,360
Boss, you killed a child.

1431
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:20,440
Amazing.

1432
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:21,360
Mission complete.

1433
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,820
Ok, I think it's over.

1434
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:26,120
One more.

1435
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:30,500
And then down.

1436
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:37,810
No, this way.

1437
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:43,350
Ok, that was weird.

1438
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,420
Ending 1 of 5.

1439
01:33:58,580 --> 01:33:59,040
Murderer!

1440
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:00,680
No way!

1441
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,760
The police, they found me so fast!

1442
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:04,640
How?

1443
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,380
I should have killed that other guy in the woods.

1444
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,380
Find all endings of chapter 1.

1445
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,700
Gone too far is what it's called.

1446
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:15,680
Police arrest man accused of murdering missing girl.

1447
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:17,880
That person!

1448
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:19,000
Thanks for the time gifted!

1449
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:27,700
A New York man is in custody after he confessed to the murder of a sterling girl who had been missing.

1450
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:28,880
Sorry.

1451
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:38,340
John Ward of Palmyra was pulled over on Snake Meadow Hill Road last night after a state trooper reported hearing a gunshot.

1452
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,800
The officer thought it might be poachers.

1453
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:42,920
I mean, have you seen?

1454
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,380
There's a chupacabra running around the woods!

1455
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:47,160
I was just doing my job!

1456
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:54,820
The officer said Ward was acting nervous and suspicious after being pulled over.

1457
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:58,140
When questioned, Ward reportedly said, I've killed her.

1458
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,680
John, John, please!

1459
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:12,280
According to the police report, the officer called for backup after Ward became increasingly upset, saying repeatedly that there was a demon inside her.

1460
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:18,280
Ward was taken to Sterling Police Headquarters for further questioning.

1461
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:28,100
Ward then confessed to authorities that he shot and killed Amy Martin, a 17-year-old girl who had been missing for 9 days after escaping from a mental institution.

1462
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:37,640
Well, it's you guys' fault for, you know, not finding her soon enough.

1463
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:40,200
Finders keepers, I guess.

1464
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:45,720
After a brief search, police located Amy's body in the woods near the now abandoned Martin home.

1465
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:55,340
In addition to receiving a gunshot wound to the stomach, Amy showed injuries suggesting that she had been thrown out of the second story window of the house.

1466
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:56,820
Oh, yeah, she did that herself.

1467
01:35:56,820 --> 01:36:04,140
An officer who helped recover the body told reporters that Amy's face had been mutilated in a very brutal manner.

1468
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:08,720
Ward was found dressed as a priest when he was pulled over.

1469
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:11,720
It's his Halloween costume.

1470
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:21,780
It is suspected that he impersonated a priest to gain his victim's trust after Catholic authorities in Rome confirmed that Ward was not an ordained minister.

1471
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,700
The rest of the article is missing.

1472
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:33,260
What he was about to do was not approved by the Vatican.

1473
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,620
New play mode?

1474
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:40,520
Oh, that's it?

1475
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,060
Why is it show 3 then?

1476
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:45,040
Welcome to membership, thank you!

1477
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:50,680
Yay!

1478
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:51,960
We got all three.

1479
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,740
On to chapter 2?

1480
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:58,820
Or should I call it here?

1481
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:00,320
No...

1482
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,060
How long would chapter 2 and 3 be?

1483
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,080
Because they're the longest.

1484
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:16,520
They're much longer, right?

1485
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:20,160
Chapter 2 is also short?

1486
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:21,660
Chapter 3 is very long.

1487
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:23,240
Chapter 2 is about an hour and a half.

1488
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:24,620
I think we can do that.

1489
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:25,460
Let's do it!

1490
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:27,400
Chapter 2!

1491
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:30,440
New game.

1492
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:32,760
Confirm.

1493
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,320
Let me undo my pin message then.

1494
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,120
Let's go baby.

1495
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:54,480
Father Garcia, you are hereby instructed to release Michael Davies from your custody and return him to his home immediately.

1496
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,300
Mr. and Mrs. Davies have already been contacted by our office.

1497
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:04,700
A representative of the church is currently en route to their home to discuss compensation and return for their discretion.

1498
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:09,900
You will meet our representative there and accompany him back to Rome.

1499
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:11,260
Cardinal?

1500
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:12,340
I thought that said girlfriend.

1501
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:16,620
Wow, Cardinal Girlfriend!

1502
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:19,580
Davies.

1503
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:20,360
Davies.

1504
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:20,600
Wait.

1505
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:25,260
Oh it's Davie Jones Locker, not Davies Jones.

1506
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:32,380
Why are you a pirate?

1507
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:36,080
Because I thought it was Davies Jones.

1508
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:46,500
You know, I'm testing you.

1509
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:47,640
Wow.

1510
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:51,320
Our cross is old and orange.

1511
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:54,620
And our toilet is in the same room.

1512
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:55,840
Is this a studio apartment?

1513
01:38:56,460 --> 01:39:01,180
Shouldn't there at least be like a door for the bathroom?

1514
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,280
In case guests come over?

1515
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:05,640
One day.

1516
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,620
One day on VTubers.

1517
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:17,460
Two weeks on VTubers.

1518
01:39:33,530 --> 01:39:39,630
Three months on VTubers.

1519
01:39:45,970 --> 01:39:47,650
It's like looking in the mirror.

1520
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:49,770
I'm so sorry.

1521
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:51,150
I can't stop yawning you guys.

1522
01:39:52,370 --> 01:39:55,350
The coffee is not coffee-ing I guess.

1523
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:58,110
But I'm not so tired.

1524
01:39:58,230 --> 01:39:59,230
I just can't stop yawning.

1525
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:01,250
Oh my gosh.

1526
01:40:07,930 --> 01:40:09,210
Oh my gosh.

1527
01:40:15,110 --> 01:40:19,010
I need to make you better first.

1528
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:26,930
Leave you silent to the demon.

1529
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:33,450
Mikey bad.

1530
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:35,210
Bad, bad, bad.

1531
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:37,070
Mikey...

1532
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:39,150
Mikey...

1533
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:40,290
Bad, bad.

1534
01:40:40,490 --> 01:40:41,030
Take that.

1535
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:43,190
You were washing your mouth out with some soap.

1536
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:44,430
Mikey bad.

1537
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:50,190
That's a bad word Mikey.

1538
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:54,430
Do you think... Do you think I should do it?

1539
01:40:54,530 --> 01:40:55,490
Do I have to kill him?

1540
01:40:57,010 --> 01:40:59,090
I feel like this is gonna...

1541
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:03,610
Oh my gosh.

1542
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:04,790
Is that blood all over him?

1543
01:41:11,330 --> 01:41:12,530
Oh, he's free.

1544
01:41:14,050 --> 01:41:16,270
I think we are in trouble.

1545
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:20,670
Mikey?

1546
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:23,090
Oh Mikey?

1547
01:41:24,770 --> 01:41:26,010
Can I leave?

1548
01:41:30,980 --> 01:41:34,940
Oh man, you made a mess of my apartment and everything.

1549
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:36,680
He took his picture!

1550
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:39,760
He's embarrassed.

1551
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:43,720
It's an embarrassing photo from the Christmas party.

1552
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:45,880
Chill!

1553
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:48,280
What's that?

1554
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:49,620
What's that you got there?

1555
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,260
Who is that?

1556
01:41:56,380 --> 01:42:01,560
I have the body of a pig?

1557
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,120
Who is this?

1558
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:11,860
We are scampering out.

1559
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:14,880
Discover Father Garcia's backstory.

1560
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:16,080
3 months of hell.

1561
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:18,140
It's 2 AM.

1562
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:22,560
Cool.

1563
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:27,720
Have you forgotten already?

1564
01:42:27,860 --> 01:42:30,820
The notes people leave behind seem to exist on the edges of memory.

1565
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:36,220
Pressing the escape key or the start button is a good way to remember what you don't realize you have forgotten.

1566
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:38,000
Wait, huh?

1567
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:42,840
If you are in a hurry, hold spacebar or the action button to skip cutscenes.

1568
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:44,560
Andregos!

1569
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:46,200
Today is my birthday!

1570
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:49,060
Glad to spend it here with you and the Wisps.

1571
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:51,360
May I ask you to sing the birthday song from MGSV?

1572
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,820
It would make my day.

1573
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:56,720
Of course!

1574
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:59,780
Happy birthday!

1575
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:00,880
Congratulations!

1576
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:06,360
Happy birthday with salutations!

1577
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:08,300
Happy birthday!

1578
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:11,820
May your scars stay blue!

1579
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:16,780
Happy birthday to you!

1580
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,000
Andregos!

1581
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:18,740
Happy birthday!

1582
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,180
Yay!

1583
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:22,360
Thank you!

1584
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:26,340
Happy birthday!

1585
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,580
And Zen, thanks for the superchat!

1586
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:35,560
Spooky tree!

1587
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:39,020
Our cross is white now.

1588
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:41,600
Sorry.

1589
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,520
Spookier tree.

1590
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:49,960
It's not Christmas yet.

1591
01:43:54,690 --> 01:43:55,410
Notice.

1592
01:43:56,510 --> 01:44:00,270
The current investigation being conducted at Gallop Cele...

1593
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:04,590
Gallop Cele...

1594
01:44:05,690 --> 01:44:07,750
Gallop Cele...

1595
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:20,730
Gallop Cemetery by the State of Connecticut Historical Society has been postponed until further notice.

1596
01:44:20,730 --> 01:44:30,210
In the interim, we ask the public to avoid the cemetery grounds, the surrounding woods, any wildlife, and any unidentified persons roaming the area.

1597
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:31,510
Thank you for your patience.

1598
01:44:32,370 --> 01:44:33,910
I'm not listening to that.

1599
01:44:34,450 --> 01:44:35,510
You're reading so well.

1600
01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:38,430
Don't sass me.

1601
01:44:41,370 --> 01:44:44,290
Why are you RIP YF Onion?

1602
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:46,270
To Onion Fairy, thank you!

1603
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:48,390
Why did you die?

1604
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:54,510
We're in the cemetery.

1605
01:44:55,470 --> 01:44:57,150
Maybe I should have looked around first.

1606
01:44:58,190 --> 01:44:58,770
Can I leave?

1607
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:04,150
Thank you!

1608
01:45:06,690 --> 01:45:08,690
The ghost is so polite.

1609
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:12,470
I'm just gonna take a little look around here.

1610
01:45:14,070 --> 01:45:19,110
Just gonna, you know, have a view of the area.

1611
01:45:19,110 --> 01:45:20,790
Are the trees all the same?

1612
01:45:21,090 --> 01:45:21,770
Oh, oh.

1613
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:24,630
Okay, I don't think there's much to explore.

1614
01:45:25,490 --> 01:45:25,890
Maybe.

1615
01:45:28,590 --> 01:45:32,170
Maybe we have nothing to explore.

1616
01:45:32,730 --> 01:45:33,150
Oh wait!

1617
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:34,850
Oh no, that's the first tree.

1618
01:45:34,970 --> 01:45:35,850
Oh, this is where I came from.

1619
01:45:35,890 --> 01:45:37,810
What if I go down from where I came from?

1620
01:45:39,430 --> 01:45:40,810
Just a stroll in the woods.

1621
01:45:40,870 --> 01:45:42,050
We don't know what's around here.

1622
01:45:43,910 --> 01:45:46,670
If I go to the left, am I at the cemetery?

1623
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:48,710
Oh, no?

1624
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:50,670
Okay, I think...

1625
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:54,210
There's not even a map.

1626
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:59,230
Yeah, we're gonna mosey on over.

1627
01:45:59,690 --> 01:46:01,330
Okay, okay, I don't think there's anything here.

1628
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:07,610
I think we can continue onward into the cemetery.

1629
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:12,650
The screens wrap around in the weirdest ways.

1630
01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:13,930
Sometimes.

1631
01:46:13,930 --> 01:46:14,030
Sometimes.

1632
01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:16,670
Okay.

1633
01:46:17,530 --> 01:46:18,030
Let's go!

1634
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:22,790
Let's go!

1635
01:46:24,570 --> 01:46:25,830
Who's this?

1636
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:28,150
Mint Phantom.

1637
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:32,750
And Mint Phantom's big ass.

1638
01:46:33,790 --> 01:46:34,870
I needed two plots.

1639
01:46:36,750 --> 01:46:37,650
Oh, what was that?

1640
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:38,470
Oh!

1641
01:46:44,550 --> 01:46:46,470
I shook hands with the devil.

1642
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:48,010
I looked him in the eye.

1643
01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:50,430
He looked like a long lost friend.

1644
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:53,410
Okay.

1645
01:46:56,820 --> 01:47:01,280
Writing your little poetry... your lyrics.

1646
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:12,560
I'll inherit his kingdom.

1647
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:15,380
You must first conjure his demon.

1648
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:18,060
You must then serve his demon.

1649
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:22,380
You must then walk among... among... among us?

1650
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,500
The children of men as his demon.

1651
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:31,500
Thus shall you receive the blessing of the unspeakable!

1652
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:41,140
Return...

1653
01:47:41,140 --> 01:47:43,080
In need of rest, Gary.

1654
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:50,470
Unspeakable!

1655
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:55,010
So this is save.

1656
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:59,630
Enter the spirit house.

1657
01:48:02,470 --> 01:48:03,390
Hello?

1658
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:04,590
Who are you?

1659
01:48:06,610 --> 01:48:07,190
Okay.

1660
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:09,710
Okay.

1661
01:48:10,350 --> 01:48:11,910
They are watching stream right now.

1662
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:15,630
They are locked in on stream.

1663
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:18,830
What is this?

1664
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:20,870
Me!

1665
01:48:23,050 --> 01:48:24,310
I've got the key!

1666
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:41,370
Are they dead or...

1667
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:43,570
I can't tell if it's like blood around their necks, you know?

1668
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:45,630
Maybe they are fine.

1669
01:48:46,170 --> 01:48:46,570
Stop!

1670
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:47,410
I'm fine.

1671
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:47,870
I'm good.

1672
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:51,550
All the doors are open!

1673
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:55,130
I don't like that.

1674
01:48:58,670 --> 01:49:00,030
Which one should we go in first?

1675
01:49:00,190 --> 01:49:03,570
I remember one of these giving me a bit of a trouble before.

1676
01:49:09,650 --> 01:49:10,730
Let's go up first.

1677
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:13,490
Oh, I think that's the key that I needed.

1678
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:16,090
Okay, let's go to the left.

1679
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:26,190
The happiest gravestone ever.

1680
01:49:27,870 --> 01:49:30,790
Wait, one of them is pointing right.

1681
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:32,550
This guy is pointing up.

1682
01:49:33,110 --> 01:49:34,790
This guy is pointing left.

1683
01:49:38,270 --> 01:49:39,890
Is it a clue?

1684
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:45,290
Is this the maze part?

1685
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:46,310
Oh gosh.

1686
01:49:50,330 --> 01:49:51,270
What is this?

1687
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:56,610
Okay, but which way?

1688
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:58,370
Hold on.

1689
01:49:59,570 --> 01:50:03,210
Do I read from right to left or left to right?

1690
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:04,650
Let me hold on.

1691
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:05,570
Let's go down real quick.

1692
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:08,770
Whoa.

1693
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:10,510
A bee!

1694
01:50:10,930 --> 01:50:11,890
Oh my gosh, thank you for the...

1695
01:50:11,890 --> 01:50:15,230
Oh my gosh, I can't see.

1696
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:16,330
I can't see this kid.

1697
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:18,530
Oh, thank you so much for the petting!

1698
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:21,410
Oopsie, I died.

1699
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:31,270
Did we get the key though?

1700
01:50:31,770 --> 01:50:32,470
In here.

1701
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:35,710
Oh no.

1702
01:50:37,090 --> 01:50:39,290
Okay, so we gotta do our little creepy smile.

1703
01:50:40,970 --> 01:50:42,070
I got the key.

1704
01:50:42,790 --> 01:50:45,250
Okay, and those guys glow red.

1705
01:50:48,210 --> 01:50:50,170
And then I'm gonna go back in and save.

1706
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:51,570
There we go, perfect.

1707
01:50:52,050 --> 01:50:52,050
Okay.

1708
01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:57,250
Oh, this kid looks like he's gonna be a little dookie head.

1709
01:50:57,550 --> 01:50:58,330
Oh gosh, okay.

1710
01:50:58,730 --> 01:51:01,710
Maybe it's up, left...

1711
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:04,750
Up, right?

1712
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:06,990
If we're going right to left?

1713
01:51:07,130 --> 01:51:10,390
Or, you know, up, left, up, right.

1714
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:13,690
Or is it right, up, left, up?

1715
01:51:16,110 --> 01:51:16,630
Right?

1716
01:51:16,930 --> 01:51:18,690
Let's try right, up.

1717
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:20,830
Right.

1718
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:26,660
Right.

1719
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:31,260
Why would you read this right to left?

1720
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:32,620
Because I came in from the right!

1721
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:37,680
I thought it was from the way I was facing like this, you know?

1722
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,360
Wait, so right...

1723
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:43,940
Up...

1724
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:49,260
Left... Nothing's changing though.

1725
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:54,040
Left...

1726
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:00,200
Up...

1727
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:01,900
Sorry,

1728
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:06,430
that scared me really bad.

1729
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:08,490
No!

1730
01:52:09,030 --> 01:52:09,830
Oh gosh!

1731
01:52:13,470 --> 01:52:14,070
I

1732
01:52:18,990 --> 01:52:21,170
can't get a good angle on this guy.

1733
01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:25,210
I'll see you again?

1734
01:52:25,330 --> 01:52:25,890
Creepy.

1735
01:52:27,390 --> 01:52:28,490
Creepy, creepy.

1736
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:31,630
I've been freed!

1737
01:52:32,110 --> 01:52:34,790
No more overbearing father turned violent alcoholic.

1738
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:37,390
No more hiding my bruises and cuts.

1739
01:52:37,670 --> 01:52:38,790
No more pills and needles.

1740
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:39,430
Oh my goodness.

1741
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:41,590
No more getting laughed at and kicked around.

1742
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:43,450
They'll never laugh at me again.

1743
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:45,770
By day my body withers away.

1744
01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:50,210
But by night my mind explores forbidden worlds of power and knowledge.

1745
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:52,630
Guided by beings of pure darkness.

1746
01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:57,410
I have been trusted with secret knowledge of the demon's seal.

1747
01:52:57,970 --> 01:53:00,310
I have learned the correct conjuring sign.

1748
01:53:00,450 --> 01:53:04,110
Drawing the inverted star along the rocks arranged in five.

1749
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:06,410
First at the top left point.

1750
01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:08,650
And then down.

1751
01:53:10,410 --> 01:53:12,610
I will lure them into the woods.

1752
01:53:13,070 --> 01:53:15,290
Then I will show them my power.

1753
01:53:18,430 --> 01:53:21,750
So can I just leave here?

1754
01:53:23,010 --> 01:53:23,650
Am I good now?

1755
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:26,230
See ya!

1756
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:30,710
Top left down?

1757
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:31,190
Wait.

1758
01:53:32,770 --> 01:53:34,930
Wait, do I have to do more?

1759
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:40,800
Ah, I think I can just leave.

1760
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:43,200
I think I am finished with that, right?

1761
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:46,980
Let's save.

1762
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:51,040
Save.

1763
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:56,080
Who is next?

1764
01:53:57,100 --> 01:53:58,260
Are you the child?

1765
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:00,760
Are you the little guy that's gonna torment me?

1766
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:03,000
Oh my gosh.

1767
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,640
Wait, are there four or are there three?

1768
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:08,640
Because there are four guys here.

1769
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:10,840
Curious.

1770
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,300
Curious, curious, curious.

1771
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:19,020
What's the eyes then for?

1772
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:23,740
I guess let's attempt this.

1773
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:27,940
I don't like this one.

1774
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:28,060
I don't like this one.

1775
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,560
I can't see him.

1776
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:34,960
Oh my gosh.

1777
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:38,580
No!

1778
01:54:42,670 --> 01:54:44,840
I can't see this kid.

1779
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:46,760
I can't see this kid.

1780
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:50,680
Stinking baby!

1781
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,940
He needs to stop farting.

1782
01:54:57,940 --> 01:55:00,160
Oh, I wasn't lined up properly.

1783
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:00,880
Oh my gosh.

1784
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:08,920
Is he going in a... Oh, I see him blinking a little bit.

1785
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:10,200
Sometimes.

1786
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:10,940
Oh, maybe...

1787
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:13,400
Wait, where the hell was he?

1788
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:14,120
I don't even know.

1789
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:15,900
Oh, there he is.

1790
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:16,300
Oh my gosh.

1791
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:16,720
Kid!

1792
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:17,600
Hey kid!

1793
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:21,760
Wow, this is...

1794
01:55:26,450 --> 01:55:28,830
Let's go check out the other area first.

1795
01:55:33,130 --> 01:55:35,050
What's over here instead?

1796
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:37,150
Spooky tree?

1797
01:55:39,590 --> 01:55:42,610
Let's check out this one first.

1798
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:46,150
Oh, I like this guy.

1799
01:55:46,430 --> 01:55:48,290
He's carrying the big old cross.

1800
01:55:49,270 --> 01:55:49,830
I like that.

1801
01:55:51,990 --> 01:55:52,550
Okay.

1802
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:56,670
Can you hide in a corner?

1803
01:55:56,810 --> 01:55:58,450
I think that's where he comes from though, right?

1804
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:06,500
Let's open the gate.

1805
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:11,380
Alright.

1806
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:13,900
Onwards.

1807
01:56:18,130 --> 01:56:19,390
I just got a game.

1808
01:56:19,610 --> 01:56:22,110
Oh my gosh.

1809
01:56:25,570 --> 01:56:26,890
Spooky.

1810
01:56:30,730 --> 01:56:32,370
Spooky, spooky, spooky.

1811
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:32,430
Spooky.

1812
01:56:38,110 --> 01:56:38,990
What's in here?

1813
01:56:39,570 --> 01:56:40,090
Oh gosh.

1814
01:56:40,570 --> 01:56:42,810
I'm a what?

1815
01:56:42,930 --> 01:56:43,310
An angel?

1816
01:56:44,570 --> 01:56:45,650
You look like a lizard.

1817
01:56:47,130 --> 01:56:48,330
Little lizard person.

1818
01:56:48,810 --> 01:56:49,410
Oh my gosh.

1819
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:50,770
I think I'm going to die.

1820
01:56:55,170 --> 01:56:57,410
It looks like a lizard person for real.

1821
01:56:58,510 --> 01:57:00,430
Interesting that it puts us back here.

1822
01:57:01,230 --> 01:57:03,430
Okay, I'll take it.

1823
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:14,930
If I face the correct direction...

1824
01:57:14,930 --> 01:57:16,950
I think it would help.

1825
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:21,010
I'm an angel.

1826
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:22,650
Yeah, that kind of looks like a frog bird.

1827
01:57:26,110 --> 01:57:27,310
Get him.

1828
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:32,500
Oh shoot.

1829
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:34,080
Oh shoot.

1830
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:35,260
Oh there he goes.

1831
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:35,820
See ya.

1832
01:57:37,940 --> 01:57:38,580
Oh gosh.

1833
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:41,560
Yeah, back away.

1834
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:45,780
Oh gosh.

1835
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:49,500
Sometimes I get them.

1836
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:54,100
My...

1837
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:56,320
Mine will answer?

1838
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:57,120
Who will answer?

1839
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:01,640
Violator?

1840
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:03,280
Oh, violator.

1841
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:07,200
Nobody was thrilled when I got pregnant.

1842
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:13,560
Not even a little happy.

1843
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:18,420
Something came out of my mouth.

1844
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:24,080
Even my doctor seemed to be judging me.

1845
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:29,460
Each time I'd leave the doctor's office, I'd see this strange woman across the street.

1846
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:32,080
All she'd do is stare at me and smile.

1847
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:36,400
No words.

1848
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:38,920
Just a big, warm smile.

1849
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:42,380
Somehow it made those visits a little more bearable.

1850
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:49,460
After I lost the baby, I saw her again across the street from the doctor's.

1851
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:54,640
Her smile was as big as ever, but somehow not as warm and friendly as I remember.

1852
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:59,940
Yesterday I was walking and was shocked to see the woman standing in the middle of the path.

1853
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:01,980
Now she was pregnant.

1854
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:04,340
She beckoned towards me.

1855
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:06,820
I followed her off the path into the woods.

1856
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:08,860
That's when I met Gary.

1857
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:20,750
Spooky.

1858
01:59:21,310 --> 01:59:23,530
Oh, it was that lady.

1859
01:59:23,690 --> 01:59:24,530
Alright, child.

1860
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:27,970
Alright, let's go kick this kid's ass.

1861
01:59:29,150 --> 01:59:31,010
But he's such a little jerk.

1862
01:59:36,350 --> 01:59:37,310
Alright, ready?

1863
01:59:39,490 --> 01:59:40,330
Gun bear.

1864
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:48,270
Oh my gosh, where did he come from?

1865
01:59:48,610 --> 01:59:50,550
Is he in the smoke or is he...

1866
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:51,850
I think he's in the smoke.

1867
01:59:54,290 --> 01:59:55,170
Maybe he's...

1868
01:59:55,170 --> 01:59:57,130
Because he came out so fast.

1869
01:59:57,350 --> 01:59:59,510
Oh my gosh, that was... He's in the clouds.

1870
01:59:59,710 --> 02:00:00,270
Okay, okay.

1871
02:00:01,010 --> 02:00:05,230
So I have to watch which... Okay, this is gonna take me maybe a couple more times.

1872
02:00:05,390 --> 02:00:05,830
Sorry, guys.

1873
02:00:12,130 --> 02:00:12,810
Oh my gosh.

1874
02:00:15,570 --> 02:00:16,770
How do I tell...

1875
02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:20,390
I see... I don't see.

1876
02:00:20,610 --> 02:00:21,370
Oh, he's in this one.

1877
02:00:26,130 --> 02:00:27,130
Oh dang it!

1878
02:00:28,150 --> 02:00:29,970
I thought he would maybe...

1879
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:33,330
Okay, okay, but I had it.

1880
02:00:33,390 --> 02:00:33,810
I had it.

1881
02:00:33,870 --> 02:00:34,570
I could see him.

1882
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:35,250
I could see him.

1883
02:00:36,110 --> 02:00:37,370
I just needed to move.

1884
02:00:38,470 --> 02:00:39,910
Yeah, you can barely...

1885
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:40,710
Very...

1886
02:00:42,050 --> 02:00:42,450
Very...

1887
02:00:43,190 --> 02:00:44,230
Barely see him.

1888
02:00:45,850 --> 02:00:47,490
Don't stand between the clouds, silly.

1889
02:00:57,270 --> 02:00:58,770
This kid sucks!

1890
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:07,630
I think I can only stand between the clouds.

1891
02:01:14,930 --> 02:01:15,650
Mintus.

1892
02:01:18,070 --> 02:01:18,790
Okay.

1893
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:20,450
Oh my goodness.

1894
02:01:20,990 --> 02:01:21,250
Okay.

1895
02:01:21,990 --> 02:01:23,230
Gosh, where is he gonna go next?

1896
02:01:23,570 --> 02:01:23,850
Okay.

1897
02:01:24,750 --> 02:01:25,290
No.

1898
02:01:29,390 --> 02:01:29,810
Dang it.

1899
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:33,170
Okay, maybe I can get him from here.

1900
02:01:34,950 --> 02:01:35,510
Oh shoot!

1901
02:01:35,650 --> 02:01:36,510
Oh my gosh, that was close.

1902
02:01:39,010 --> 02:01:40,730
I don't know which way he's gonna go from here.

1903
02:01:40,970 --> 02:01:41,670
Wait, where did he go?

1904
02:01:41,930 --> 02:01:42,270
Oh, okay.

1905
02:01:55,740 --> 02:01:56,720
ViviCorne, thanks for the 5!

1906
02:01:57,220 --> 02:01:57,500
Gifted!

1907
02:01:57,820 --> 02:01:59,360
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

1908
02:01:59,360 --> 02:01:59,400
5!

1909
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:04,260
See ya, baby.

1910
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:08,700
Losing grandpa was the hardest thing I ever experienced.

1911
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:10,460
These games are so depressing.

1912
02:02:12,180 --> 02:02:14,000
We were really close.

1913
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:16,020
I cried about it for weeks.

1914
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:19,040
Then my stepmom introduced me to some of her friends.

1915
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:22,340
They asked me, would you like to see your grandfather again?

1916
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:25,740
I missed him so much I was willing to try anything.

1917
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:29,740
That night, my stepmom drove me to one of her friends' house.

1918
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:31,880
They took me down to the basement.

1919
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:33,680
I saw my grandfather in there.

1920
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,380
Only it wasn't actually him.

1921
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:38,980
When I tried to run, they closed the basement door and locked me in!

1922
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:41,020
I can't remember much else from that night.

1923
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:45,700
My stepmom's friends are always coming by the house now.

1924
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:47,680
They tell me I have a debt to pay.

1925
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:50,540
They say...

1926
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:52,740
They have work for me to do.

1927
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:54,780
Oh my gosh.

1928
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:57,800
They are headless now.

1929
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:03,280
I watch only the freshest of herbs.

1930
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:04,660
Wait, this thing has changed too.

1931
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:08,500
I'm at the end though.

1932
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,740
Do I have to...

1933
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:16,540
Oh my gosh.

1934
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:17,740
I'm bleeding out.

1935
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:21,080
Wait, what's that thing in the corner?

1936
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:22,300
That's not me, right?

1937
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:22,940
No.

1938
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:26,660
What should I draw with my blood?

1939
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:35,900
M...

1940
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:39,200
I...

1941
02:03:42,940 --> 02:03:43,980
T...

1942
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:47,440
Minto.

1943
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:54,640
And among us...

1944
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:55,260
Okay, hold on.

1945
02:04:07,230 --> 02:04:10,670
It kind of has a big dumpy, but you can see...

1946
02:04:15,670 --> 02:04:17,010
I'll draw you guys too.

1947
02:04:18,190 --> 02:04:20,350
Oh wait, I forgot to draw your wispy self.

1948
02:04:25,470 --> 02:04:26,430
And then...

1949
02:04:28,450 --> 02:04:29,410
And then...

1950
02:04:30,670 --> 02:04:31,630
And then...

1951
02:04:31,630 --> 02:04:32,470
Your eyes.

1952
02:04:32,930 --> 02:04:34,510
Hold on, I'm just gonna extra bleed there.

1953
02:04:34,690 --> 02:04:36,450
Okay, now extra bleed here.

1954
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,610
Okay, perfect.

1955
02:04:40,130 --> 02:04:41,230
And a big ol' smile.

1956
02:04:44,350 --> 02:04:45,550
And then...

1957
02:04:45,550 --> 02:04:46,930
The details.

1958
02:04:47,610 --> 02:04:48,090
It's you!

1959
02:04:56,070 --> 02:04:58,050
Solve the riddle of Gallop's ce...

1960
02:04:58,050 --> 02:05:00,330
Why do I keep saying ce...

1961
02:05:01,030 --> 02:05:01,630
Cemetery?

1962
02:05:02,510 --> 02:05:03,470
I can't.

1963
02:05:05,630 --> 02:05:07,110
I keep saying...

1964
02:05:11,130 --> 02:05:12,510
Oh, we can save.

1965
02:05:14,070 --> 02:05:16,250
Are we dead or...

1966
02:05:16,990 --> 02:05:18,590
It's like I'm saying celery.

1967
02:05:19,550 --> 02:05:20,930
Oh, we can save again.

1968
02:05:21,070 --> 02:05:21,510
Okay, cool.

1969
02:05:21,790 --> 02:05:23,730
Wait, I don't have to do all these things again, right?

1970
02:05:26,710 --> 02:05:27,590
Oh, they're headless.

1971
02:05:27,650 --> 02:05:27,830
Okay.

1972
02:05:28,510 --> 02:05:29,350
Let's go up.

1973
02:05:33,490 --> 02:05:34,350
Celery.

1974
02:05:35,950 --> 02:05:36,810
Cellophane.

1975
02:05:36,970 --> 02:05:39,010
Mr. Cellophane.

1976
02:05:39,350 --> 02:05:41,570
Should I change my name?

1977
02:05:42,190 --> 02:05:43,520
Mr. Cellophane.

1978
02:05:44,110 --> 02:05:46,610
Cause they can look right through me.

1979
02:05:47,110 --> 02:05:49,070
Walk right by me.

1980
02:05:49,810 --> 02:05:51,950
They'll never know I'm there.

1981
02:05:52,090 --> 02:05:55,750
I never knew that guy was there either.

1982
02:05:56,110 --> 02:05:57,230
Damn tree!

1983
02:06:02,350 --> 02:06:03,070
Okay.

1984
02:06:04,490 --> 02:06:05,090
Oh, you!

1985
02:06:05,650 --> 02:06:06,850
Which tree is it?

1986
02:06:14,850 --> 02:06:16,090
Which tree is it?

1987
02:06:17,010 --> 02:06:17,190
You.

1988
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:19,110
You.

1989
02:06:20,590 --> 02:06:20,950
You.

1990
02:06:21,910 --> 02:06:22,590
You.

1991
02:06:24,270 --> 02:06:26,430
I guess, actually, maybe, okay.

1992
02:06:27,170 --> 02:06:29,470
Love seeing Mortis' phantom play Faith.

1993
02:06:29,470 --> 02:06:30,290
Ah!

1994
02:06:45,950 --> 02:06:47,630
Fish want her.

1995
02:06:49,810 --> 02:06:52,210
Confess thy sins.

1996
02:06:55,770 --> 02:06:59,150
I remember the trick to the candles.

1997
02:07:00,650 --> 02:07:01,170
Vaguely.

1998
02:07:01,710 --> 02:07:08,250
It's like where... The candles show where something is... In what room something is in.

1999
02:07:08,510 --> 02:07:09,010
I remember.

2000
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:10,450
I remember.

2001
02:07:11,010 --> 02:07:11,890
Very vaguely.

2002
02:07:13,470 --> 02:07:17,770
Day one of our paranormal investigation into the Old Snake Meadow Hill Church.

2003
02:07:18,110 --> 02:07:20,590
We've got three cameras, a box of tapes... Oh my god, wait.

2004
02:07:20,690 --> 02:07:20,950
Hold on.

2005
02:07:21,670 --> 02:07:23,050
Are you ghost hunters?

2006
02:07:26,750 --> 02:07:30,290
When I was a kid, I experienced the paranormal.

2007
02:07:31,010 --> 02:07:32,870
And now, I hunt the paranormal.

2008
02:07:33,670 --> 02:07:35,390
And it follows me in my everyday life.

2009
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:42,850
I'm joined by my other investigators, Aaron and the other guy who nobody knows his name.

2010
02:07:44,110 --> 02:07:48,110
My name is Zack Baggins.

2011
02:07:48,610 --> 02:07:51,270
And these are our ghost adventures.

2012
02:07:52,570 --> 02:07:57,450
Day one of our paranormal investigation into the Old Snake Meadow Hill Church.

2013
02:07:57,750 --> 02:08:04,410
We've got three cameras, a box of tapes, and enough beer and beef jerky to last us a week.

2014
02:08:04,730 --> 02:08:07,990
On our way in, we asked some of the locals about the church.

2015
02:08:08,370 --> 02:08:10,930
It was mostly the stories we had heard before.

2016
02:08:11,470 --> 02:08:16,490
Evil spirits dragging children into the cornfield and secret tunnels under the chapel.

2017
02:08:17,130 --> 02:08:20,790
But there was this spindly lady game that we hadn't heard yet.

2018
02:08:21,530 --> 02:08:28,790
Apparently, it has to do with summoning the spirit of a woman who used to take care of the orphans back in the 50s.

2019
02:08:29,130 --> 02:08:31,510
There was even an old rhyme they told us.

2020
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:39,130
Walk the church from room to room, and maybe you will see her.

2021
02:08:40,610 --> 02:08:45,950
But she will move when you do, but never try to trick her.

2022
02:08:46,110 --> 02:08:48,610
Okay, you can't rhyme her with her.

2023
02:08:50,750 --> 02:08:52,530
That's the same word.

2024
02:08:53,410 --> 02:08:54,830
Who came up with this rhyme?

2025
02:08:54,870 --> 02:08:55,830
It's not a rhyme.

2026
02:08:56,510 --> 02:09:00,650
You can't rhyme the same word next to each other.

2027
02:09:05,950 --> 02:09:09,350
It's not... It doesn't work like that.

2028
02:09:16,830 --> 02:09:18,170
Ghosts can't be critics.

2029
02:09:18,410 --> 02:09:19,110
Why not?

2030
02:09:20,650 --> 02:09:21,110
Awesome.

2031
02:09:21,590 --> 02:09:24,830
We are going to try the game tonight as soon as we get settled in.

2032
02:09:25,330 --> 02:09:28,010
So she is in this room somewhere?

2033
02:09:30,630 --> 02:09:32,330
Or... What room are we in?

2034
02:09:32,410 --> 02:09:33,630
We are in this one, right?

2035
02:09:34,090 --> 02:09:34,950
This one right here?

2036
02:09:36,850 --> 02:09:37,850
Why did the music stop?

2037
02:09:40,590 --> 02:09:41,150
Okay.

2038
02:09:43,330 --> 02:09:46,010
So now she is in... Oh no, I see.

2039
02:09:46,170 --> 02:09:48,530
We are... Okay, that's where we are.

2040
02:09:49,410 --> 02:09:51,030
We are that one.

2041
02:09:51,150 --> 02:09:52,330
Okay, I got it.

2042
02:09:53,930 --> 02:09:54,710
Night 3.

2043
02:09:55,190 --> 02:09:56,190
Shouldn't have come here.

2044
02:09:56,470 --> 02:09:57,230
Tapes missing.

2045
02:09:57,850 --> 02:09:59,470
Lars stuck behind basement door.

2046
02:09:59,810 --> 02:10:00,910
Henry hasn't come back yet.

2047
02:10:01,150 --> 02:10:02,110
Can't leave anyway.

2048
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:05,630
Isn't there something in here?

2049
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:16,260
Pray for me father, for I have sinned.

2050
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:18,540
Let's see if you can do it like this.

2051
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:19,280
I've sinned.

2052
02:10:19,340 --> 02:10:24,660
I tried to save a girl from evil, but my fears overcame me.

2053
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:30,800
I turned my back on the ministry, and broke my vows to God.

2054
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:34,920
A year later, the girl reached out to me again.

2055
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:37,600
But in the end, I couldn't save her.

2056
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:38,320
Couldn't save her.

2057
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:39,680
I left her to die.

2058
02:10:39,680 --> 02:10:44,000
I am sorry for me and my past sins.

2059
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:56,880
I don't like that.

2060
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:05,700
Why is Palpatine in there?

2061
02:11:17,130 --> 02:11:18,610
Where are we?

2062
02:11:23,150 --> 02:11:25,990
Be gone evil Mona Lisa.

2063
02:11:27,830 --> 02:11:28,770
Night 1.

2064
02:11:29,190 --> 02:11:33,110
We still haven't found a way into the basement, but we found something just as cool.

2065
02:11:33,510 --> 02:11:37,030
A secret passage in the old confession booth leading to this hallway.

2066
02:11:37,030 --> 02:11:41,850
Henry is going into town to buy a crowbar.

2067
02:11:42,110 --> 02:11:46,510
We'll see if we can get these boards off of some of these doors.

2068
02:11:47,350 --> 02:11:48,890
But that's not even the best part.

2069
02:11:49,170 --> 02:11:51,070
We caught an EVP.

2070
02:11:51,610 --> 02:11:53,930
An electronic voice phenomenon.

2071
02:11:54,950 --> 02:11:56,330
That's what EVP is.

2072
02:11:57,870 --> 02:12:02,510
You can't hear it on tape very well, but to us it kind of sounded like laughing.

2073
02:12:03,570 --> 02:12:06,310
Thank God we brought the nice mic.

2074
02:12:06,310 --> 02:12:10,130
No, everybody knows you bring the really terrible mics.

2075
02:12:10,330 --> 02:12:12,210
They all bring the same mics.

2076
02:12:12,330 --> 02:12:17,050
Did you guys know that they all bring the same mics from like the mid 2000s?

2077
02:12:17,170 --> 02:12:19,890
That like everything is so static-y.

2078
02:12:20,210 --> 02:12:22,210
So even if you hear like a...

2079
02:12:22,210 --> 02:12:24,030
It sounds on the tape.

2080
02:12:24,330 --> 02:12:26,990
It sounds like a ghost being like, I will kill you.

2081
02:12:27,170 --> 02:12:27,470
You know?

2082
02:12:28,450 --> 02:12:29,850
And then they'll be like, whoa.

2083
02:12:30,330 --> 02:12:33,110
Did that ghost just say spaghetti?

2084
02:12:34,210 --> 02:12:35,310
They all do that.

2085
02:12:36,930 --> 02:12:40,210
We'll review it on the sound gear once we get back into town.

2086
02:12:41,170 --> 02:12:44,150
Okay, so we're in this room.

2087
02:12:44,370 --> 02:12:45,330
The secret room.

2088
02:12:48,330 --> 02:12:49,490
What about this one?

2089
02:12:49,730 --> 02:12:50,990
Is this a death?

2090
02:12:52,050 --> 02:12:52,430
Nope.

2091
02:12:53,850 --> 02:12:55,070
Can't go in for some reason.

2092
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:56,210
Nevermind.

2093
02:12:57,070 --> 02:12:58,170
Is someone gonna come out though?

2094
02:12:59,790 --> 02:13:01,050
Is someone gonna come out?

2095
02:13:01,730 --> 02:13:02,770
Okay, nevermind.

2096
02:13:02,770 --> 02:13:04,850
Oh, we might be able to meet with her.

2097
02:13:04,990 --> 02:13:05,730
In the middle right here.

2098
02:13:07,070 --> 02:13:07,870
Oh lady.

2099
02:13:09,030 --> 02:13:10,510
So are we hearing men through EVP?

2100
02:13:12,270 --> 02:13:13,070
Basically, but...

2101
02:13:13,070 --> 02:13:14,430
I sound nice and crisp, don't I?

2102
02:13:16,610 --> 02:13:18,090
Oh dang it, she's in this room.

2103
02:13:18,750 --> 02:13:19,530
Do you think she'll move?

2104
02:13:21,790 --> 02:13:22,390
Something's here.

2105
02:13:23,550 --> 02:13:24,030
Oh gosh.

2106
02:13:25,710 --> 02:13:26,150
Boo.

2107
02:13:27,770 --> 02:13:28,210
Boo.

2108
02:13:29,710 --> 02:13:32,390
Do you talk about weird ghost hunters with other ghosts?

2109
02:13:33,390 --> 02:13:34,610
Sometimes, yeah, actually.

2110
02:13:36,890 --> 02:13:38,030
Lady, where are you?

2111
02:13:38,470 --> 02:13:39,630
Spin, spindly lady.

2112
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:41,150
Something's here.

2113
02:13:41,230 --> 02:13:42,290
I know, I know, I know.

2114
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:42,710
Where?

2115
02:13:45,620 --> 02:13:45,940
Where?

2116
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:48,560
Oh my gosh, she scared the heck out of me.

2117
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:49,640
Oh my gosh.

2118
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:57,460
Oh gosh.

2119
02:13:57,660 --> 02:13:58,380
I'm gonna die.

2120
02:13:58,840 --> 02:13:59,420
Oh my god.

2121
02:13:59,660 --> 02:14:00,720
I didn't get to kill her.

2122
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:02,720
Oh shoot.

2123
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:03,980
I'm gonna...

2124
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:06,260
Oh my god.

2125
02:14:07,340 --> 02:14:09,160
Lady, give me a good angle please.

2126
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:09,960
Give me a good angle.

2127
02:14:10,180 --> 02:14:10,520
Here we go.

2128
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:12,720
I got a little bit in at least.

2129
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:13,020
Okay.

2130
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:14,340
Oh my god.

2131
02:14:18,780 --> 02:14:20,180
Lady, you're too spindly.

2132
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:22,100
Oh, I was looking the wrong direction.

2133
02:14:26,540 --> 02:14:27,100
Oh.

2134
02:14:33,270 --> 02:14:34,230
Drive by.

2135
02:14:34,530 --> 02:14:35,750
Drive by cross.

2136
02:14:38,090 --> 02:14:39,350
Drive by cross.

2137
02:14:40,150 --> 02:14:41,030
Oh my gosh.

2138
02:14:41,290 --> 02:14:41,870
No, no, no.

2139
02:14:41,930 --> 02:14:42,790
She's gonna kill me for real.

2140
02:14:47,370 --> 02:14:47,930
Nice.

2141
02:14:50,230 --> 02:14:51,090
Did she say heretic?

2142
02:14:53,330 --> 02:14:53,890
Yay!

2143
02:14:53,890 --> 02:14:54,470
Yay!

2144
02:14:56,210 --> 02:14:57,750
Drive by crossing.

2145
02:15:01,350 --> 02:15:02,830
What's this?

2146
02:15:03,330 --> 02:15:04,810
Big cross.

2147
02:15:05,290 --> 02:15:06,510
Watch the candles.

2148
02:15:07,290 --> 02:15:07,970
You're too late.

2149
02:15:08,850 --> 02:15:13,630
Oh my gosh.

2150
02:15:15,210 --> 02:15:16,490
You're too late.

2151
02:15:16,550 --> 02:15:17,830
I already figured out the puzzle.

2152
02:15:18,230 --> 02:15:18,770
Gosh.

2153
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:23,380
I already knew.

2154
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:29,000
I'm smarter than these stupid ghosts.

2155
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:30,440
Watch the candies?

2156
02:15:30,760 --> 02:15:31,020
Wait.

2157
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:32,340
Candies?

2158
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:33,460
I thought it said candles.

2159
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:42,920
Oh, they won't come back down.

2160
02:15:43,060 --> 02:15:44,280
It says candles, you guys.

2161
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:44,900
I can't read.

2162
02:15:48,340 --> 02:15:49,300
Same thing.

2163
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:52,640
Candies.

2164
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:59,500
Well, we haven't looked around the other rooms, so let's do that real quick.

2165
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:02,660
Oh.

2166
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:08,040
Night 2.

2167
02:16:08,380 --> 02:16:09,520
We're gonna be rich.

2168
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:12,560
We've caught supernatural stuff on Chaos.

2169
02:16:13,020 --> 02:16:14,580
Sorry, I thought they were saying they caught it.

2170
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:23,680
The design of the Spiggly Lady was selected as the winner for the developer's open character design contest announced before the full version of Chapter 2 was released back in 2018.

2171
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:25,500
Oh, really?

2172
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:29,780
Guys, candy, because it's almost Halloween.

2173
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:34,520
We've caught supernatural stuff on camera before, sure.

2174
02:16:34,820 --> 02:16:39,740
Doors opening on their own, things falling off of shelves, but nothing like this.

2175
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:49,640
Tonight, while we were trying the Spiggly Lady game again, one of the candles on the floor lit up by itself as soon as Lars walked into the room.

2176
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:54,160
It was nuts, and we got it all on film.

2177
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:57,460
We're gonna make a fortune selling this to the TV stations.

2178
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:00,880
Aw, man.

2179
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:03,360
Silly ghost hunters.

2180
02:17:05,380 --> 02:17:10,460
Usually, though, for ghost hunters and stuff...

2181
02:17:12,620 --> 02:17:15,540
Like, we just don't want to be bossed around, you know?

2182
02:17:15,580 --> 02:17:17,540
And they're just like, show yourself.

2183
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:20,540
No, it makes me not want to show myself.

2184
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:21,440
You know?

2185
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:23,860
Like, I'm quietly dead.

2186
02:17:24,260 --> 02:17:29,340
Living, or not really living, but like, you know, enjoying my quiet, dead afterlife.

2187
02:17:29,820 --> 02:17:33,540
And you come into my cafe, and you're just like...

2188
02:17:34,380 --> 02:17:35,420
Say something.

2189
02:17:37,520 --> 02:17:39,040
You say something.

2190
02:17:41,480 --> 02:17:42,540
You tellin' me to?

2191
02:17:42,740 --> 02:17:44,540
Yeah, that's what I'm sayin'.

2192
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:49,020
So, you know...

2193
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,700
Darkness surrounds thee.

2194
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:58,740
Oh, reach the basement of Snake Meadow Hill Church.

2195
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:01,140
Who's watching me now?

2196
02:18:03,560 --> 02:18:05,760
But sometimes it is fun to mess with them, you know?

2197
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:08,420
To mess with the ghost hunters.

2198
02:18:10,340 --> 02:18:11,260
And do something silly.

2199
02:18:12,300 --> 02:18:13,360
New ghost hunter trick.

2200
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:14,860
Ask the ghost about metal gear.

2201
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:16,380
But that only works for me.

2202
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:19,640
That only works for me.

2203
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:22,140
I wonder if there's any other ghosts that like metal gear.

2204
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:25,620
I would like to be their friend.

2205
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:32,420
This is my final memoir.

2206
02:18:33,540 --> 02:18:36,060
Hastily scribbled on a page of the good book.

2207
02:18:36,580 --> 02:18:40,500
I now descend the staircase knowing full well that she waits for me ahead.

2208
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:45,660
Checking my old watch has revealed something quite astonishing.

2209
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:49,240
Time doesn't change down here as we know it on the surface.

2210
02:18:49,700 --> 02:18:52,080
Even now, the hands don't move past two.

2211
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:55,360
Give us a sign, Minto.

2212
02:18:58,520 --> 02:19:00,500
Ghost hunters sound like a pain to deal with.

2213
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:04,600
How much could ghost pelts and ghost meat possibly sell for?

2214
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:06,840
Like, is it a lot?

2215
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:08,540
Could you live off of it?

2216
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:10,260
Ghost pelts?

2217
02:19:11,360 --> 02:19:12,320
Ghost meat?

2218
02:19:17,380 --> 02:19:18,540
The good book?

2219
02:19:18,780 --> 02:19:19,480
Lord of the Rings?

2220
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:20,180
No, no.

2221
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:23,940
They mean my doujin collection.

2222
02:19:28,020 --> 02:19:30,180
God's work be done.

2223
02:19:30,840 --> 02:19:37,500
I have been to where only the faintest light shine to protect from things unspeakable.

2224
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:42,680
God help me, Father Clark, a foolish old man going mad in this dark prison.

2225
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:45,360
Ears bleeding from the screams of the demon.

2226
02:19:46,580 --> 02:19:48,380
I don't know what any of that means.

2227
02:19:55,440 --> 02:19:57,500
Am I gonna have to remember this?

2228
02:19:57,620 --> 02:19:58,660
Gosh, I don't remember.

2229
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:01,420
Any ghost bones?

2230
02:20:01,820 --> 02:20:03,360
Any haunted bones here?

2231
02:20:04,900 --> 02:20:08,580
I think my chat is screwed up again, you guys.

2232
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:09,360
I'm really sorry.

2233
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:10,880
Oh gosh, I can't leave here.

2234
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:12,540
Wait, hold on.

2235
02:20:12,540 --> 02:20:15,460
My chat... YouTube is so bad recently.

2236
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:17,220
I don't know why.

2237
02:20:23,560 --> 02:20:25,660
Like, it just keeps freezing on me.

2238
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:27,220
Basically, every stream.

2239
02:20:27,380 --> 02:20:28,540
I don't get it.

2240
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:30,740
It's actually so frustrating.

2241
02:20:32,060 --> 02:20:36,460
It freezes on me and then when I go to the YouTube site, it doesn't load anything.

2242
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:38,700
So it's just... Oh, it's the worst.

2243
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:39,260
It's terrible.

2244
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:39,420
It's terrible.

2245
02:20:50,060 --> 02:20:53,420
Okay, we're back, baby.

2246
02:20:54,900 --> 02:20:55,360
We're back.

2247
02:20:56,420 --> 02:20:57,760
Can I read that again?

2248
02:20:57,940 --> 02:20:58,300
No.

2249
02:20:58,500 --> 02:20:58,780
Okay.

2250
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:01,460
Oh shoot.

2251
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:03,360
Guys, I...

2252
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:07,440
I think I'm gonna die.

2253
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:15,160
Mortis.

2254
02:21:19,560 --> 02:21:20,580
Let's see.

2255
02:21:23,660 --> 02:21:25,180
YouTube has been kind of terrible recently.

2256
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:25,680
I know.

2257
02:21:26,500 --> 02:21:27,720
Okay, so...

2258
02:21:28,260 --> 02:21:29,280
Oh gosh.

2259
02:21:30,640 --> 02:21:31,400
So...

2260
02:21:33,860 --> 02:21:36,000
This is a lot.

2261
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:40,660
Um...

2262
02:21:40,660 --> 02:21:42,060
Think clock.

2263
02:21:44,460 --> 02:21:46,100
I'd screenshot it.

2264
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:48,680
Remember the note.

2265
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:51,780
Wait, I just got rid of the note.

2266
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:53,620
Notes.

2267
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:57,920
Davies.

2268
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:03,680
Oh, this note is missing?

2269
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:04,080
Okay.

2270
02:22:06,140 --> 02:22:08,040
Note 9-3.

2271
02:22:09,340 --> 02:22:10,540
Paranormal investigation.

2272
02:22:11,540 --> 02:22:12,680
Why isn't it in order?

2273
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:14,020
Why isn't it in order?

2274
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:14,980
No!

2275
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:18,840
Father Garcia.

2276
02:22:20,720 --> 02:22:21,820
Wait, no.

2277
02:22:22,060 --> 02:22:22,320
No.

2278
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:29,040
Wait, it is in order.

2279
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:29,180
It is in order.

2280
02:22:31,860 --> 02:22:32,480
Ah!

2281
02:22:32,740 --> 02:22:33,380
Here we go.

2282
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:38,680
This is my final memoir hastily scribbled on the page of the good book.

2283
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:43,220
Checking my old watch has revealed something quite astonishing.

2284
02:22:43,580 --> 02:22:45,230
Time doesn't change down here as if...

2285
02:22:45,620 --> 02:22:47,440
Oh, it doesn't move past 2.

2286
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:53,520
So maybe I need to go to the one that is like 2 PM.

2287
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:57,280
Which would be...

2288
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:02,040
That kanji radical.

2289
02:23:03,980 --> 02:23:05,480
Yeah, the H.

2290
02:23:06,580 --> 02:23:07,380
The H.

2291
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:09,620
Maybe 3?

2292
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:12,280
Would it be the X or the H?

2293
02:23:12,460 --> 02:23:14,060
I guess we'll figure it out.

2294
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:17,200
This one.

2295
02:23:35,370 --> 02:23:37,550
Then there was this one.

2296
02:23:40,270 --> 02:23:41,890
This was 3.

2297
02:23:46,290 --> 02:23:47,870
Keep following the clock.

2298
02:23:47,990 --> 02:23:49,490
Oh gosh, I don't remember what was after.

2299
02:23:51,090 --> 02:23:53,170
I think you have to look at the patterns after H.

2300
02:23:55,630 --> 02:24:01,790
Is it upside down dirt?

2301
02:24:03,030 --> 02:24:03,910
Or Uzumaki?

2302
02:24:07,230 --> 02:24:08,390
Let's go to this one.

2303
02:24:09,370 --> 02:24:10,390
Oh, I did it.

2304
02:24:10,550 --> 02:24:11,470
I was correct.

2305
02:24:12,150 --> 02:24:15,230
Is it clock?

2306
02:24:15,910 --> 02:24:17,490
Or is it deadpool?

2307
02:24:21,700 --> 02:24:23,640
If you get it wrong, just go back to the entrance of the room.

2308
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:25,000
Arrows.

2309
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:30,200
Thank you.

2310
02:24:30,660 --> 02:24:31,440
Oh my gosh, heretic.

2311
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:33,860
Thank you.

2312
02:24:36,320 --> 02:24:38,980
Is it funny dancey forks?

2313
02:24:40,420 --> 02:24:41,640
Or tiny house?

2314
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:47,840
Oh, is it Uzumaki now?

2315
02:24:50,610 --> 02:24:52,050
Then we go to flower?

2316
02:24:54,490 --> 02:24:55,950
Do I just go this way?

2317
02:25:00,990 --> 02:25:04,310
Mother of demons!

2318
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:09,530
I like these guys.

2319
02:25:19,180 --> 02:25:22,620
They are so fun.

2320
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:27,260
Oh my gosh, we made it outside!

2321
02:25:32,300 --> 02:25:34,600
We came from a porta potty!

2322
02:25:40,520 --> 02:25:43,040
I almost got trampled by a deer for real.

2323
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:47,260
Thanks for the help with the clock puzzle guys.

2324
02:25:48,860 --> 02:25:53,360
Three murdered in latest wave of ritualistic killings.

2325
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:54,900
Sterling, Connecticut.

2326
02:25:55,900 --> 02:26:00,280
The bodies of three young people were discovered in the woods outside of Sterling last night.

2327
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:04,180
And what authorities are calling a ritualistic murder!

2328
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:13,660
Sandra Atwood, Angel Nogales, and Troy Inglis.

2329
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:22,840
Are the names of the unfortunate victims who were apparently stabbed multiple times and beheaded before being killed in a paganistic ritual.

2330
02:26:23,140 --> 02:26:26,980
Do you think those are the three people that I fought in the cemetery?

2331
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:36,060
Pandemonium Regnet.

2332
02:26:36,060 --> 02:26:36,640
Nat.

2333
02:26:39,860 --> 02:26:47,940
Two of the victims' bodies were also partially burned, although authorities would not specify who.

2334
02:26:52,160 --> 02:27:00,480
The bodies were found several miles from Gallop Cemetery, where residents reported a tomb had been desecrated.

2335
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:03,100
Yeah, so maybe...

2336
02:27:04,360 --> 02:27:05,580
How do I say your name?

2337
02:27:07,400 --> 02:27:09,060
Thank you for three bars!

2338
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:10,500
Thank you, thank you!

2339
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:14,300
Chaos Reigns.

2340
02:27:15,800 --> 02:27:19,220
They also found trails of blood leading off into the woods.

2341
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:23,700
Investigators would not comment on whether or not these two incidents could be related.

2342
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:35,280
The arrangement of the bodies in the ritualistic pattern, as well as the writing of certain symbols and blood, matches the style of several murders that have occurred in the Sterling area since 1986.

2343
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:39,580
I think we have... I think... I think there's...

2344
02:27:42,100 --> 02:27:43,220
I don't... What is that?

2345
02:27:43,300 --> 02:27:44,680
I don't know how to say that word.

2346
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:48,340
You're looking hauntingly bootiful tonight.

2347
02:27:48,860 --> 02:27:49,980
Thank you, Brian!

2348
02:27:50,260 --> 02:27:52,640
Just seeing you raises my spirits!

2349
02:27:57,160 --> 02:27:57,680
What is this?

2350
02:27:57,680 --> 02:28:02,260
The killings may have connected to last week's brutal slaying of Amy Martin.

2351
02:28:02,860 --> 02:28:03,880
Wait, slaying?

2352
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:04,900
We didn't kill her though.

2353
02:28:06,360 --> 02:28:07,840
Thank you, thank you!

2354
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:08,620
I'm gifted!

2355
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:12,200
A 17-year-old girl by John Ward.

2356
02:28:12,620 --> 02:28:17,460
Ward had impersonated a priest to gain Amy's trust before luring her into the woods and killing her.

2357
02:28:17,780 --> 02:28:18,240
No!

2358
02:28:18,420 --> 02:28:19,780
We didn't do that!

2359
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:21,460
We didn't do... I mean...

2360
02:28:21,460 --> 02:28:24,460
It was like the last ending we did, but...

2361
02:28:25,420 --> 02:28:26,780
But we did the...

2362
02:28:26,780 --> 02:28:32,350
We did the...

2363
02:28:32,350 --> 02:28:36,750
Investigators are asking residents to report any suspicious activity to the police.

2364
02:28:37,150 --> 02:28:43,930
Authorities are urging the people of Sterling to not mourn the loss of Atwood, Nogales, and Inglis...

2365
02:28:44,750 --> 02:28:54,450
...Inglis, because after all, they were degenerate devil-worshipping thugs who were hooked on crack cocaine and hated their parents.

2366
02:28:54,690 --> 02:28:59,110
Why even conduct an investigation at all?

2367
02:29:00,430 --> 02:29:03,330
That's what you would like them to think, wouldn't you, John?

2368
02:29:03,770 --> 02:29:05,410
Oh my gosh!

2369
02:29:05,950 --> 02:29:09,950
They were just three pathetic outcasts who got what they deserved.

2370
02:29:10,930 --> 02:29:18,030
You actually did the community a favor when you found them getting high in... that tomb.

2371
02:29:18,610 --> 02:29:21,910
Sorry, I'm a demon, but I have, like, a bit of a stutter.

2372
02:29:22,770 --> 02:29:23,290
Sorry!

2373
02:29:23,690 --> 02:29:25,230
Oh my god, how embarrassing.

2374
02:29:25,830 --> 02:29:27,030
Um, okay, back to scary.

2375
02:29:27,510 --> 02:29:31,430
You stalked them through the graves and killed them one by one.

2376
02:29:31,710 --> 02:29:35,650
You ignored their cries for help, their pleas for mercy.

2377
02:29:36,490 --> 02:29:40,550
You put holes in their ruined, drug-addict bodies.

2378
02:29:40,910 --> 02:29:47,590
And then you chopped off their heads because everybody knows that removing the head is the only way to kill a snake.

2379
02:29:48,330 --> 02:29:48,830
Whoa!

2380
02:29:49,970 --> 02:29:51,790
And guess what?

2381
02:29:51,990 --> 02:29:53,770
You didn't kill the snake, John.

2382
02:29:53,870 --> 02:29:56,490
You cannot kill what you cannot be killed.

2383
02:29:56,910 --> 02:29:59,830
Thou shalt not raise up what thou shalt...

2384
02:29:59,830 --> 02:30:00,790
Wait, hold on.

2385
02:30:03,170 --> 02:30:04,150
One more time.

2386
02:30:05,750 --> 02:30:10,410
Thou shalt not raise up what thou canst not put down again.

2387
02:30:10,890 --> 02:30:14,550
Thou couldst not... couldnst not kill Amy.

2388
02:30:14,770 --> 02:30:19,050
Thou shalt not destroy my works, for they are the works of the eternal dragon.

2389
02:30:19,870 --> 02:30:21,850
Even now she is at thy door.

2390
02:30:22,170 --> 02:30:23,850
Her hand is at thy throat.

2391
02:30:24,110 --> 02:30:25,290
Yet you see her not.

2392
02:30:25,290 --> 02:30:31,370
I will have thy soul, for I am the god of this world.

2393
02:30:34,350 --> 02:30:35,830
This is kind of doing it for me.

2394
02:30:37,570 --> 02:30:38,990
Brother, please.

2395
02:30:40,230 --> 02:30:42,010
Get some help.

2396
02:30:42,130 --> 02:30:43,230
Oh my god.

2397
02:30:45,010 --> 02:30:46,190
Oh, there's more.

2398
02:30:48,630 --> 02:30:49,050
PANDEMONIUM.

2399
02:30:49,050 --> 02:30:50,490
REGNOT SATANI.

2400
02:30:50,730 --> 02:30:52,010
RETIRE PANDEMONIUM.

2401
02:30:52,170 --> 02:30:53,130
REGNOT SATANI.

2402
02:30:53,170 --> 02:30:54,090
RETIRE PANDEMONIUM.

2403
02:30:54,150 --> 02:30:54,910
REGNOT SATANI.

2404
02:30:54,950 --> 02:30:55,650
RETIRE PANDEMONIUM.

2405
02:30:55,810 --> 02:30:58,230
Oh, there's more.

2406
02:31:00,910 --> 02:31:02,910
It kind of looks like it says pregnant.

2407
02:31:10,870 --> 02:31:11,290
PARGON.

2408
02:31:11,410 --> 02:31:11,810
PARGON.

2409
02:31:11,950 --> 02:31:12,210
SICK.

2410
02:31:12,310 --> 02:31:12,370
SICK.

2411
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:12,750
SICK.

2412
02:31:12,830 --> 02:31:12,970
SICK.

2413
02:31:13,070 --> 02:31:13,070
SICK.

2414
02:31:13,750 --> 02:31:14,170
SICK.

2415
02:31:14,170 --> 02:31:14,250
SICK.

2416
02:31:14,410 --> 02:31:14,410
SICK.

2417
02:31:14,570 --> 02:31:14,690
SICK.

2418
02:31:14,690 --> 02:31:14,770
SICK.

2419
02:31:14,770 --> 02:31:17,230
Yeah, the devil's number.

2420
02:31:20,110 --> 02:31:21,370
I am here, John.

2421
02:31:32,910 --> 02:31:34,930
I'm a little spider guy now!

2422
02:31:35,810 --> 02:31:36,050
Woo!

2423
02:31:36,230 --> 02:31:36,790
Party, party!

2424
02:31:37,970 --> 02:31:38,210
Woo!

2425
02:31:38,370 --> 02:31:38,970
Party, party!

2426
02:31:47,330 --> 02:31:49,550
If I were a spider, where would I go?

2427
02:31:50,110 --> 02:31:50,890
I'd go this way.

2428
02:31:50,890 --> 02:31:52,250
Okay.

2429
02:31:57,610 --> 02:31:59,470
Up the water spout?

2430
02:31:59,690 --> 02:31:59,750
Oh!

2431
02:32:00,890 --> 02:32:02,230
You were right!

2432
02:32:02,510 --> 02:32:04,150
Up the water spout.

2433
02:32:07,450 --> 02:32:11,790
Down came the rain and washed the spider out.

2434
02:32:12,170 --> 02:32:13,250
Hey, fellows!

2435
02:32:14,290 --> 02:32:16,890
Wait, why is there an arrow that points down?

2436
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:22,860
I don't want to be a spider again.

2437
02:32:24,700 --> 02:32:25,680
Try left?

2438
02:32:26,020 --> 02:32:26,680
Wait, can I actually?

2439
02:32:27,380 --> 02:32:28,000
Like, from here?

2440
02:32:30,460 --> 02:32:31,340
Go on left?

2441
02:32:33,260 --> 02:32:33,820
No,

2442
02:32:36,840 --> 02:32:37,640
nothing happens.

2443
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:43,400
So, let's go down.

2444
02:32:43,580 --> 02:32:45,120
I guess because it's pointing that way.

2445
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:47,860
Oh no, their car is broken down.

2446
02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:49,000
That sucks so much.

2447
02:32:55,700 --> 02:32:57,340
I can go help him out.

2448
02:32:58,060 --> 02:32:59,880
Hey guys, I'm a good mechanic.

2449
02:33:00,300 --> 02:33:02,020
Okay, I'm really slow up this hill though.

2450
02:33:02,320 --> 02:33:05,380
Okay, I'm a person who needs to work out a bit more.

2451
02:33:06,660 --> 02:33:07,080
John?

2452
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:10,200
I can't even get up the hill.

2453
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:10,880
Nevermind.

2454
02:33:13,140 --> 02:33:14,020
Okay, nevermind.

2455
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:19,760
It's a bad ending thing.

2456
02:33:20,500 --> 02:33:21,380
So you'll be good.

2457
02:33:21,980 --> 02:33:23,680
Wait, going up there is a bad ending?

2458
02:33:26,200 --> 02:33:29,540
Oh, I should have been a little spider.

2459
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:32,100
And then I could have been like...

2460
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:36,760
I see.

2461
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:38,360
I should have never...

2462
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:39,740
Candy Tunnel!

2463
02:33:39,820 --> 02:33:41,100
You guys were right about the candy!

2464
02:33:43,740 --> 02:33:44,980
What did it say?

2465
02:33:45,080 --> 02:33:45,980
Watch the candy?

2466
02:33:47,100 --> 02:33:48,020
Death awaits.

2467
02:33:50,440 --> 02:33:52,060
Oh, enter Candy Tunnel.

2468
02:33:55,580 --> 02:33:57,460
This looks like...

2469
02:33:57,460 --> 02:34:02,160
It's not... No, from here it looks like... Okay, do you guys know the club Mogra?

2470
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:04,860
From here it looks like the Mogra symbol.

2471
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:08,220
Here it's an eyeball.

2472
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:10,400
Okay, hold on.

2473
02:34:10,900 --> 02:34:12,100
Okay, can't do that.

2474
02:34:16,060 --> 02:34:17,440
Yeah, the Mogra logo.

2475
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:22,700
Oh, scary.

2476
02:34:23,940 --> 02:34:25,020
Does that say snake?

2477
02:34:25,400 --> 02:34:28,240
Oh god, is something coming after me or is it just ambiance?

2478
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:30,240
Okay, so...

2479
02:34:33,220 --> 02:34:35,260
Hey now, you're an ale star.

2480
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:38,000
Oh my gosh, this is a man!

2481
02:34:42,300 --> 02:34:44,000
Multiple officers wounded.

2482
02:34:44,180 --> 02:34:46,480
One dead in sewer tunnel shootout.

2483
02:34:48,220 --> 02:35:01,200
Law enforcement officials are reporting multiple officers down, including one deputy who was fatally wounded after an exchange of gunfire in the sewer tunnels near Snake Meadow Hill Road, also known as the Candy Tunnel.

2484
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:03,040
Why do we call it the Candy Tunnel?

2485
02:35:04,140 --> 02:35:06,200
It has such a cheerful name.

2486
02:35:06,580 --> 02:35:09,840
Give it a new tunnel... Give it a new name...

2487
02:35:10,500 --> 02:35:13,240
All the kids are going to be heading to Candy Tunnel otherwise.

2488
02:35:15,940 --> 02:35:28,840
Witnesses say they heard the shots approximately 10 minutes after police raided the tunnels, where suspected murderers Joe Bauman, aka the Candy Store Killer, was alleged to be hiding.

2489
02:35:29,300 --> 02:35:32,560
At this time, it is not known how many officers have been wounded.

2490
02:35:33,820 --> 02:35:36,420
Although it has been confirmed that one officer has been killed.

2491
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:42,720
Officials are not saying if Bauman was wounded in the exchange, and efforts are being made to recover the casualties from the tunnels.

2492
02:35:43,460 --> 02:35:44,360
Have a nice night, Minto!

2493
02:35:44,480 --> 02:35:45,320
Early morning tomorrow here.

2494
02:35:45,660 --> 02:35:47,620
Have a good night, Senshi!

2495
02:35:48,700 --> 02:35:54,900
I hope that you don't have to wake up... Well, you have to wake up early, but hopefully you don't feel tired about it, you know?

2496
02:35:55,140 --> 02:35:57,020
Hey, what's that little red thing over there?

2497
02:35:58,220 --> 02:35:58,520
Hello?

2498
02:36:02,900 --> 02:36:04,420
Are you going to run at me?

2499
02:36:11,530 --> 02:36:13,410
S-Satin lives.

2500
02:36:18,010 --> 02:36:19,770
I spelled Satan wrong.

2501
02:36:20,610 --> 02:36:22,390
No, they just really love to sew.

2502
02:36:25,390 --> 02:36:30,030
They're just like, yeah, satin is like the best fabric, baby!

2503
02:36:34,790 --> 02:36:35,390
Akui?

2504
02:36:35,690 --> 02:36:36,490
What does Akui mean?

2505
02:36:36,490 --> 02:36:39,430
Let's go to Candy Tunnel, Charlie!

2506
02:36:39,730 --> 02:36:40,010
No!

2507
02:36:40,990 --> 02:36:41,530
No!

2508
02:36:42,950 --> 02:36:46,270
Two more dead discovered outside Candy Tunnel near Sterling.

2509
02:36:46,430 --> 02:36:51,990
Two more bodies have been recovered from the drainage ditch under Snake Meadow Hill Road outside Sterling.

2510
02:36:55,970 --> 02:36:56,610
Sorry.

2511
02:36:57,770 --> 02:37:07,770
The notorious Candy Tunnel, known in the area to be home to addicts, gangs, runaways, and the indigent...

2512
02:37:07,770 --> 02:37:12,490
...has been the site of several grisly discoveries over the past three months.

2513
02:37:12,910 --> 02:37:17,150
Since May, five bodies have been recovered from the drainage ditch leading to the tunnels.

2514
02:37:17,250 --> 02:37:18,610
I think we just need to, like...

2515
02:37:18,610 --> 02:37:24,030
Okay, I think we just need to, like, silent hill this city and then forget it ever exists, you know?

2516
02:37:24,910 --> 02:37:29,030
Let's just, like, remove it from the map and...

2517
02:37:29,870 --> 02:37:32,390
Let's just, you know...

2518
02:37:32,390 --> 02:37:32,950
Oh my gosh.

2519
02:37:34,550 --> 02:37:36,030
Let's just, like...

2520
02:37:38,250 --> 02:37:39,510
What's another thing?

2521
02:37:39,630 --> 02:37:44,690
Let's discover something under the ground that will poison the city and force everybody to move.

2522
02:37:46,010 --> 02:37:46,890
Easy peasy.

2523
02:37:48,430 --> 02:37:50,070
Silent hill the entire Connecticut?

2524
02:37:50,070 --> 02:37:55,570
No, it's just this snake meadow hill area, I think.

2525
02:37:58,370 --> 02:37:59,850
Casual villain talk.

2526
02:37:59,930 --> 02:38:02,410
No, this town is the villain.

2527
02:38:03,430 --> 02:38:04,470
It's the whole town.

2528
02:38:05,350 --> 02:38:09,370
Authorities are being pressured by concerned citizens to search the tunnels.

2529
02:38:10,570 --> 02:38:18,070
Amid fears of a possible connection to Joe Bauman, aka the candy store killer, who has claimed eight victims in Connecticut and Rhode Island...

2530
02:38:18,070 --> 02:38:20,910
Oh, time to get rid of Rhode Island too.

2531
02:38:21,450 --> 02:38:22,430
Over the past year.

2532
02:38:23,530 --> 02:38:24,510
What does Akui mean?

2533
02:38:26,710 --> 02:38:28,370
Oh, wait, how did I...

2534
02:38:30,830 --> 02:38:31,190
Huh?

2535
02:38:32,550 --> 02:38:34,850
The game wraps around so weird.

2536
02:38:35,430 --> 02:38:36,290
It means here.

2537
02:38:36,290 --> 02:38:36,630
Oh.

2538
02:38:38,490 --> 02:38:39,290
So here.

2539
02:38:44,780 --> 02:38:45,180
Nothing.

2540
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:47,460
Nothing, eh?

2541
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:52,000
Can't tell what the other doodles are.

2542
02:38:56,620 --> 02:38:57,940
It's pronounced Aki.

2543
02:38:58,280 --> 02:38:58,860
Oh, thank you.

2544
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:01,180
Wait, oh my gosh, how am I getting so lost now?

2545
02:39:01,740 --> 02:39:03,320
This is so strange.

2546
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:04,360
Oh my gosh, you guys.

2547
02:39:05,020 --> 02:39:06,760
Now that I... I can't go back to the beginning.

2548
02:39:06,760 --> 02:39:07,980
Maybe I can here?

2549
02:39:08,280 --> 02:39:10,080
No, I can't go back to the beginning anymore.

2550
02:39:10,860 --> 02:39:12,520
Oh my gosh, this is so weird.

2551
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:13,600
I'm lost.

2552
02:39:13,720 --> 02:39:15,660
Yeah, it's looping in a really weird way.

2553
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:19,600
There they go.

2554
02:39:22,600 --> 02:39:24,900
I don't have a way to get through there yet.

2555
02:39:26,540 --> 02:39:27,020
Nope.

2556
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:32,460
It's pretty spooky down... Read.

2557
02:39:33,380 --> 02:39:33,860
Okay.

2558
02:39:33,860 --> 02:39:34,040
Okay.

2559
02:39:37,470 --> 02:39:38,550
Read what?

2560
02:39:41,030 --> 02:39:42,850
Read the signs?

2561
02:39:43,230 --> 02:39:43,430
Oh.

2562
02:39:43,990 --> 02:39:45,430
When see.

2563
02:39:48,730 --> 02:39:50,350
Don't... I'm scared.

2564
02:39:51,350 --> 02:39:55,090
Hey now, you're an L star, get your game on, go play.

2565
02:39:56,330 --> 02:40:00,530
When you see it, don't move.

2566
02:40:01,710 --> 02:40:02,050
It

2567
02:40:09,940 --> 02:40:10,700
told me to move.

2568
02:40:13,220 --> 02:40:13,880
Oh gosh.

2569
02:40:15,020 --> 02:40:16,600
Does that say snake up there?

2570
02:40:16,960 --> 02:40:18,100
It's my type of graffiti.

2571
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:24,280
Oh my gosh.

2572
02:40:25,300 --> 02:40:26,040
Oh god.

2573
02:40:35,650 --> 02:40:36,250
Mother.

2574
02:40:46,830 --> 02:40:47,830
Oh my gosh.

2575
02:40:49,890 --> 02:40:51,750
Oh, we can go through here though.

2576
02:40:52,570 --> 02:40:52,750
Where?

2577
02:40:52,830 --> 02:40:52,990
How?

2578
02:40:53,170 --> 02:40:53,530
How?

2579
02:40:53,690 --> 02:40:54,590
Which direction?

2580
02:40:59,550 --> 02:41:01,450
Can I go this way?

2581
02:41:02,250 --> 02:41:02,550
No.

2582
02:41:03,290 --> 02:41:03,790
Interesting.

2583
02:41:04,590 --> 02:41:06,010
Just came from the walls.

2584
02:41:06,690 --> 02:41:07,870
Oh, I can go this way.

2585
02:41:11,210 --> 02:41:11,370
Pero?

2586
02:41:13,470 --> 02:41:14,730
Here we go.

2587
02:41:15,530 --> 02:41:16,410
Up the tunnel.

2588
02:41:17,850 --> 02:41:19,490
What does pelo mean?

2589
02:41:25,290 --> 02:41:26,730
I'm scared.

2590
02:41:28,170 --> 02:41:29,830
Yeah, I clipped through the wall.

2591
02:41:31,170 --> 02:41:31,530
Hair?

2592
02:41:32,870 --> 02:41:36,670
I mean, the ghosts have been very, like, hairy.

2593
02:41:37,910 --> 02:41:39,070
Oh, it's saved.

2594
02:41:40,970 --> 02:41:42,630
Is there anything over here?

2595
02:41:44,870 --> 02:41:45,610
Maybe not.

2596
02:41:52,770 --> 02:41:54,210
Oh goodness.

2597
02:41:56,070 --> 02:41:57,570
What does this say?

2598
02:41:57,570 --> 02:41:59,150
Oh, I'm sorry.

2599
02:41:59,250 --> 02:42:00,470
God, please save me.

2600
02:42:01,530 --> 02:42:02,650
There is no saving you.

2601
02:42:05,070 --> 02:42:06,550
This place looks friendly.

2602
02:42:08,010 --> 02:42:09,730
Mostly body hair.

2603
02:42:10,790 --> 02:42:12,690
Head hair is cabelo.

2604
02:42:14,350 --> 02:42:16,670
Okay, so we got this mouth.

2605
02:42:17,430 --> 02:42:18,950
Looks really friendly.

2606
02:42:22,370 --> 02:42:22,730
Okay.

2607
02:42:23,970 --> 02:42:25,170
Let's go this way.

2608
02:42:26,770 --> 02:42:28,070
Check out this area.

2609
02:42:28,650 --> 02:42:29,750
Let's follow the blood.

2610
02:42:30,170 --> 02:42:31,170
Always a good idea.

2611
02:42:32,190 --> 02:42:34,690
Every horror movie protagonist does this.

2612
02:42:35,790 --> 02:42:35,990
Oh.

2613
02:42:39,410 --> 02:42:41,270
Do I have to?

2614
02:42:42,310 --> 02:42:43,250
Oh, cabelo.

2615
02:42:43,490 --> 02:42:43,810
Sorry.

2616
02:42:44,190 --> 02:42:46,330
I'm so sorry.

2617
02:42:46,810 --> 02:42:48,990
You guys are like, no Mint, please.

2618
02:42:57,270 --> 02:42:58,490
What is that anyway?

2619
02:43:01,190 --> 02:43:02,370
Oh, it's a flashlight.

2620
02:43:02,850 --> 02:43:03,790
Oh god.

2621
02:43:05,750 --> 02:43:07,070
Oh my god, no.

2622
02:43:20,140 --> 02:43:21,820
Oh god, I think I'm dead.

2623
02:43:26,180 --> 02:43:27,120
Where are you?

2624
02:43:28,540 --> 02:43:29,480
There are children!

2625
02:43:31,080 --> 02:43:31,780
Where are you?

2626
02:43:35,700 --> 02:43:36,720
I can't...

2627
02:43:38,080 --> 02:43:38,620
Shit!

2628
02:43:43,090 --> 02:43:43,690
Oh my god.

2629
02:43:47,190 --> 02:43:48,750
You can't catch me?

2630
02:43:51,350 --> 02:43:51,890
Party!

2631
02:43:58,230 --> 02:43:58,990
Oh my god.

2632
02:43:59,390 --> 02:44:00,150
Suffer with my...

2633
02:44:00,150 --> 02:44:01,370
Oh my god!

2634
02:44:01,450 --> 02:44:01,990
Oh my god!

2635
02:44:02,150 --> 02:44:02,750
Oh my god!

2636
02:44:02,750 --> 02:44:03,450
Oh my god.

2637
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:05,550
Oh shit, he's gone.

2638
02:44:05,790 --> 02:44:06,250
Oh shoot.

2639
02:44:06,710 --> 02:44:07,790
Oh shoot, he's gone.

2640
02:44:08,870 --> 02:44:09,490
Where?

2641
02:44:18,090 --> 02:44:19,610
I did it!

2642
02:44:21,330 --> 02:44:22,570
Holy moly!

2643
02:44:23,590 --> 02:44:24,470
I did it!

2644
02:44:24,550 --> 02:44:25,190
I did it!

2645
02:44:27,430 --> 02:44:27,990
Yippee!

2646
02:44:29,630 --> 02:44:30,190
Yippee!

2647
02:44:31,770 --> 02:44:35,150
Maybe just a little more speed, John boy, for real.

2648
02:44:38,830 --> 02:44:41,210
John is so casual about this.

2649
02:44:41,210 --> 02:44:42,570
He's just like...

2650
02:44:42,570 --> 02:44:44,850
I'll mosey along, I suppose.

2651
02:44:51,510 --> 02:44:53,290
The party is up here, baby.

2652
02:44:54,470 --> 02:44:56,650
Can we get like a save after that, please?

2653
02:44:56,730 --> 02:44:57,130
Thank you.

2654
02:44:58,190 --> 02:44:58,550
Game.

2655
02:45:00,930 --> 02:45:01,950
Oh gosh.

2656
02:45:04,490 --> 02:45:06,530
I don't...I don't like this.

2657
02:45:07,650 --> 02:45:09,630
I wish I had not just flashlight.

2658
02:45:09,730 --> 02:45:10,810
Why is it so dark?

2659
02:45:12,910 --> 02:45:13,590
Teehee?

2660
02:45:13,590 --> 02:45:16,130
Oh I think he said he is here, actually.

2661
02:45:17,130 --> 02:45:17,650
Teehee!

2662
02:45:19,330 --> 02:45:20,010
Teehee!

2663
02:45:22,110 --> 02:45:23,930
He is here.

2664
02:45:23,930 --> 02:45:24,250
Oh!

2665
02:45:26,990 --> 02:45:28,770
Crash your party.

2666
02:45:28,970 --> 02:45:30,570
Enter the hidden sanctum.

2667
02:45:35,630 --> 02:45:37,330
Oh my gosh.

2668
02:45:37,510 --> 02:45:38,690
I don't like this at all.

2669
02:45:39,010 --> 02:45:41,050
They hate the light.

2670
02:45:41,530 --> 02:45:42,130
Got it.

2671
02:45:47,670 --> 02:45:50,430
I hate this whole concept.

2672
02:45:51,410 --> 02:45:53,590
I really don't like it.

2673
02:45:54,930 --> 02:45:55,970
Oh gosh.

2674
02:45:59,630 --> 02:46:00,110
Ok.

2675
02:46:06,860 --> 02:46:08,820
Let's...Oh, oh, oh.

2676
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:10,120
Oh shoot.

2677
02:46:10,460 --> 02:46:11,000
Oh god.

2678
02:46:11,140 --> 02:46:11,940
Oh they are everywhere.

2679
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:12,760
Oh they are everywhere.

2680
02:46:13,540 --> 02:46:15,540
Hey, back off, back off, back off ladies.

2681
02:46:15,860 --> 02:46:17,020
Back off ladies, please.

2682
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:18,080
I'm busy.

2683
02:46:20,920 --> 02:46:21,640
Oh god.

2684
02:46:22,320 --> 02:46:23,180
Back off ladies!

2685
02:46:27,020 --> 02:46:28,120
Oh my god.

2686
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:28,820
I'm almost dead.

2687
02:46:28,820 --> 02:46:29,740
Ok.

2688
02:46:33,460 --> 02:46:34,860
Is anybody in here?

2689
02:46:36,060 --> 02:46:38,020
There is children running everywhere.

2690
02:46:38,680 --> 02:46:39,740
Why can't I grab the key?

2691
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:41,460
Oh I got it.

2692
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:41,640
Ok.

2693
02:46:46,300 --> 02:46:47,400
Oh my goodness.

2694
02:46:48,600 --> 02:46:49,620
The ladies love you.

2695
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:49,940
I know.

2696
02:46:50,040 --> 02:46:52,160
They can't keep their hands off of me, apparently.

2697
02:46:53,100 --> 02:46:54,720
I don't want to have to redo this.

2698
02:46:56,220 --> 02:46:57,140
Oh.

2699
02:46:58,760 --> 02:46:59,900
What's this?

2700
02:47:00,700 --> 02:47:02,120
I can't get to it yet.

2701
02:47:02,860 --> 02:47:04,620
I have to...

2702
02:47:04,620 --> 02:47:05,080
Ok.

2703
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:06,820
Purple child.

2704
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:08,800
Oh my gosh.

2705
02:47:12,300 --> 02:47:14,660
The three things for the bad end.

2706
02:47:15,760 --> 02:47:18,360
I see the spider.

2707
02:47:19,780 --> 02:47:21,420
And then...

2708
02:47:21,880 --> 02:47:24,060
Not sure what the child is.

2709
02:47:25,480 --> 02:47:27,080
And then something to do.

2710
02:47:27,160 --> 02:47:27,360
Ok.

2711
02:47:28,820 --> 02:47:30,500
I see, I see, I see.

2712
02:47:30,560 --> 02:47:32,040
I have to find three secrets to open that.

2713
02:47:32,480 --> 02:47:32,920
Interesting.

2714
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:34,240
Oh gosh!

2715
02:47:34,640 --> 02:47:36,180
Oh my god, this kid.

2716
02:47:36,600 --> 02:47:37,620
Leave me alone.

2717
02:47:38,760 --> 02:47:39,200
Please.

2718
02:47:39,480 --> 02:47:42,860
Ok, I have to go back through here, which is going to be really annoying, but...

2719
02:47:42,860 --> 02:47:44,020
Please, leave me.

2720
02:47:44,780 --> 02:47:46,000
I'm just going to run for it.

2721
02:47:49,580 --> 02:47:50,360
And go.

2722
02:47:51,360 --> 02:47:52,260
Back, back.

2723
02:47:52,920 --> 02:47:53,480
Be gone.

2724
02:47:54,600 --> 02:47:55,880
I did it!

2725
02:48:03,910 --> 02:48:05,770
Anything, anything here?

2726
02:48:10,090 --> 02:48:11,210
Oh my god!

2727
02:48:11,290 --> 02:48:12,170
There they are!

2728
02:48:19,340 --> 02:48:20,470
Oh my god!

2729
02:48:26,110 --> 02:48:27,650
Father Garcia!

2730
02:48:35,850 --> 02:48:37,530
I'm really...

2731
02:48:37,530 --> 02:48:39,390
It's like...

2732
02:48:39,390 --> 02:48:41,550
It's like basically like...

2733
02:48:43,330 --> 02:48:45,070
One of those quests, you know?

2734
02:48:45,490 --> 02:48:46,530
One of those missions.

2735
02:48:46,670 --> 02:48:47,370
Escort missions.

2736
02:48:48,930 --> 02:48:50,070
Ok, Father Garcia.

2737
02:48:50,850 --> 02:48:51,690
You speak.

2738
02:48:52,230 --> 02:48:53,250
I'll do the work.

2739
02:48:55,790 --> 02:48:56,190
Maybe.

2740
02:48:56,530 --> 02:48:57,790
I'll do my best at least.

2741
02:48:57,910 --> 02:48:59,450
Ok, you can't really...

2742
02:48:59,450 --> 02:48:59,990
Ok, hold on.

2743
02:49:00,130 --> 02:49:01,590
Can I trust you?

2744
02:49:04,590 --> 02:49:05,730
Ok, I think you're safe.

2745
02:49:12,510 --> 02:49:15,730
Yeah, I know.

2746
02:49:15,730 --> 02:49:20,370
Let us go.

2747
02:49:21,550 --> 02:49:22,350
Thanks father.

2748
02:49:23,810 --> 02:49:25,010
Amen to that.

2749
02:49:26,590 --> 02:49:27,250
Oh boy.

2750
02:49:27,450 --> 02:49:28,090
Ok, it's saved.

2751
02:49:33,760 --> 02:49:36,320
Cool rotoscoping cutscene.

2752
02:49:38,360 --> 02:49:39,120
Oh goodness.

2753
02:49:47,220 --> 02:49:47,780
Yeah!

2754
02:49:52,400 --> 02:49:52,960
Hey,

2755
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:02,100
back off!

2756
02:50:02,360 --> 02:50:02,800
Back off!

2757
02:50:02,900 --> 02:50:05,080
This is like paparazzi training.

2758
02:50:06,300 --> 02:50:09,100
I know Father Garcia is really sought after.

2759
02:50:09,700 --> 02:50:10,140
Oh my goodness.

2760
02:50:10,900 --> 02:50:13,060
Don't move around Father Garcia, please!

2761
02:50:21,260 --> 02:50:23,240
Yeah, two birds with one stone, baby!

2762
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:25,060
Back off!

2763
02:50:25,340 --> 02:50:25,860
Back off!

2764
02:50:25,900 --> 02:50:26,660
I'm the bodyguard!

2765
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:28,220
I'm the bodyguard!

2766
02:50:28,740 --> 02:50:29,780
Back off everybody!

2767
02:50:31,280 --> 02:50:31,760
Yeah, yeah!

2768
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:39,040
Back off!

2769
02:50:42,440 --> 02:50:43,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2770
02:50:44,320 --> 02:50:45,960
I know you want to touch his hand.

2771
02:50:46,020 --> 02:50:46,720
You want to get his autograph.

2772
02:50:46,880 --> 02:50:47,320
He's busy.

2773
02:50:50,300 --> 02:50:52,240
He's reciting something.

2774
02:50:53,140 --> 02:50:54,500
He's got a lot of words, ok?

2775
02:50:54,940 --> 02:50:56,360
Let him finish his speech everybody.

2776
02:50:58,440 --> 02:50:59,560
His little monologue...

2777
02:50:59,560 --> 02:51:00,820
Oh shoot.

2778
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:03,400
Oh no, I don't like this.

2779
02:51:04,500 --> 02:51:04,940
Father?

2780
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:05,720
Father!

2781
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:07,800
Father, I'm scared.

2782
02:51:08,260 --> 02:51:09,000
Father, where did you go?

2783
02:51:09,640 --> 02:51:10,020
Father!

2784
02:51:18,530 --> 02:51:20,170
Father, I am scared.

2785
02:51:20,570 --> 02:51:22,070
Father, I am scared.

2786
02:51:23,010 --> 02:51:24,130
Father, help me.

2787
02:51:24,510 --> 02:51:25,170
Father, where did you go?

2788
02:51:27,230 --> 02:51:29,010
I don't like the music.

2789
02:51:37,660 --> 02:51:39,340
Oh my gosh.

2790
02:51:40,500 --> 02:51:41,900
That was so close guys.

2791
02:51:42,380 --> 02:51:43,600
Holy moly, that was so close.

2792
02:51:52,210 --> 02:51:56,850
Sorry I can't really reach out right now guys, but I'm fighting for my afterlife here.

2793
02:51:56,850 --> 02:51:58,690
Well, really John's life.

2794
02:52:01,930 --> 02:52:04,030
Oh my gosh.

2795
02:52:04,150 --> 02:52:04,890
Oh my gosh.

2796
02:52:04,990 --> 02:52:05,530
Oh my gosh.

2797
02:52:05,710 --> 02:52:07,450
Ok, yep, we're doing it John.

2798
02:52:14,630 --> 02:52:15,830
We got her?

2799
02:52:16,470 --> 02:52:17,090
Oh shoot.

2800
02:52:17,230 --> 02:52:17,490
Run!

2801
02:52:17,790 --> 02:52:17,790
Run!

2802
02:52:18,090 --> 02:52:18,450
Run!

2803
02:52:18,650 --> 02:52:18,650
Run!

2804
02:52:18,770 --> 02:52:18,910
Run!

2805
02:52:21,650 --> 02:52:22,170
Nice!

2806
02:52:25,330 --> 02:52:25,850
Nice!

2807
02:52:26,170 --> 02:52:27,610
Oh, I don't know what this means.

2808
02:52:27,610 --> 02:52:28,210
Oh my gosh.

2809
02:52:28,310 --> 02:52:29,350
Get out of the way father!

2810
02:52:30,030 --> 02:52:30,530
Father!

2811
02:52:30,710 --> 02:52:31,970
Father, get out of the way!

2812
02:52:32,350 --> 02:52:33,310
Father, she's coming.

2813
02:52:33,870 --> 02:52:34,990
Father, she's doing something.

2814
02:52:37,110 --> 02:52:37,730
Oh my god.

2815
02:52:38,010 --> 02:52:38,310
Father.

2816
02:52:39,030 --> 02:52:41,590
Father, you need to get out of the way please.

2817
02:52:48,420 --> 02:52:49,680
Father is daring.

2818
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:50,620
Yeah, for real.

2819
02:52:51,980 --> 02:52:52,920
We got her?

2820
02:52:53,580 --> 02:52:54,380
Oh gosh.

2821
02:52:56,660 --> 02:52:57,160
Exploding!

2822
02:52:57,500 --> 02:52:57,940
Thank you!

2823
02:52:58,360 --> 02:52:59,460
Welcome to Mambo Ship!

2824
02:52:59,460 --> 02:53:00,160
Oh god.

2825
02:53:00,260 --> 02:53:00,700
Out of the way!

2826
02:53:00,780 --> 02:53:01,100
Out of the way!

2827
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:01,980
Father, please!

2828
02:53:02,440 --> 02:53:03,420
You're scaring me!

2829
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:04,680
How are you living?

2830
02:53:08,280 --> 02:53:09,080
Phase 2?

2831
02:53:15,480 --> 02:53:16,760
The morning breaks.

2832
02:53:16,840 --> 02:53:17,640
Oh we did it?

2833
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:18,480
First try!

2834
02:53:20,400 --> 02:53:20,920
Yahoo!

2835
02:53:21,540 --> 02:53:22,860
We gamed!

2836
02:53:25,300 --> 02:53:26,980
John, I can't do this anymore.

2837
02:53:27,220 --> 02:53:27,720
I'm sorry.

2838
02:53:27,980 --> 02:53:29,120
I will always love you back.

2839
02:53:29,620 --> 02:53:29,940
Molly.

2840
02:53:31,160 --> 02:53:33,120
Let's just tuck that away in there.

2841
02:53:33,760 --> 02:53:34,620
Oh Molly.

2842
02:53:35,800 --> 02:53:36,980
I keep your pillow.

2843
02:53:37,480 --> 02:53:38,360
Just smell it.

2844
02:53:38,660 --> 02:53:39,760
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly.

2845
02:53:40,980 --> 02:53:44,040
I'm just a simple priest with a boy in my basement.

2846
02:53:46,100 --> 02:53:47,980
Or in this room I guess.

2847
02:53:49,320 --> 02:53:50,520
Holy moly.

2848
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:53,260
First try baby.

2849
02:53:55,960 --> 02:53:59,160
John, we don't have much time.

2850
02:53:59,480 --> 02:54:02,280
The profane Sabbath is almost upon us.

2851
02:54:02,660 --> 02:54:08,440
If they find Nate and Jason, they will perform a ritual on them to call forth a demon of unspeakable power.

2852
02:54:09,420 --> 02:54:12,360
The name of the demon is...

2853
02:54:13,180 --> 02:54:13,760
Malphas.

2854
02:54:15,480 --> 02:54:18,920
I am in the process of discovering their whereabouts.

2855
02:54:19,120 --> 02:54:20,760
I will contact you again soon.

2856
02:54:20,760 --> 02:54:25,200
We must not let them do what the boys... Wait.

2857
02:54:25,380 --> 02:54:26,920
Do to the boys what they did to Amy.

2858
02:54:27,320 --> 02:54:28,180
Father Garcia.

2859
02:54:34,440 --> 02:54:37,960
Make that a habit.

2860
02:54:38,180 --> 02:54:38,740
Wait, wait.

2861
02:54:40,900 --> 02:54:43,120
I don't know this demon.

2862
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:47,480
The boys!

2863
02:54:52,380 --> 02:54:52,880
Stopped.

2864
02:55:01,440 --> 02:55:01,940
Faith!

2865
02:55:07,900 --> 02:55:10,260
Wait, where is the rain of spiders?

2866
02:55:10,360 --> 02:55:11,220
Is it in the third part?

2867
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:13,280
Yeah, it's in the third part.

2868
02:55:13,920 --> 02:55:15,140
I'm sorry David.

2869
02:55:15,960 --> 02:55:16,800
Survive the nightmare.

2870
02:55:16,900 --> 02:55:18,340
Oh my gosh, we got the ending one.

2871
02:55:18,460 --> 02:55:20,040
Go forth with faith.

2872
02:55:20,820 --> 02:55:23,000
How many endings are in this one?

2873
02:55:24,100 --> 02:55:26,100
Yeah, rain of spiders are in the third chapter.

2874
02:55:28,720 --> 02:55:30,220
It's on the last boss.

2875
02:55:34,820 --> 02:55:38,780
New backgrounds, new effect unlocked, new play mode unlocked.

2876
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:40,020
Nice.

2877
02:55:41,860 --> 02:55:46,560
And guys, that was Faith chapters 1 and 2.

2878
02:55:48,900 --> 02:55:49,260
Nice.

2879
02:55:53,180 --> 02:55:54,820
I went for the last chapters.

2880
02:55:56,340 --> 02:56:00,900
Or rather, I went for... Sorry, I went for all endings of chapter 1 because they were pretty easy to get.

2881
02:56:01,340 --> 02:56:06,200
But, how easy is it to get the other... I mean, I feel like I have to go way back in chapter 2.

2882
02:56:07,400 --> 02:56:09,000
And like, do stuff, you know.

2883
02:56:10,380 --> 02:56:12,040
When ending is more complicated.

2884
02:56:14,040 --> 02:56:15,020
It's a lot harder, yeah.

2885
02:56:15,560 --> 02:56:19,920
It's like a little bit more effort than I'm willing to put in, today at least.

2886
02:56:21,740 --> 02:56:23,440
Ending 2, you can let Garcia die.

2887
02:56:24,100 --> 02:56:26,800
Yeah, but then I have to do the final boss all over again, and I gamed!

2888
02:56:29,400 --> 02:56:31,620
Chapter 3 of True Ending is very worth getting.

2889
02:56:33,400 --> 02:56:35,620
Basically play the whole chapter, seriously.

2890
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:41,520
But, we gamed.

2891
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:43,240
We gamed in that final boss fight.

2892
02:56:44,560 --> 02:56:45,940
I don't know how he lived.

2893
02:56:46,560 --> 02:56:48,380
He was like, just standing in the middle of it.

2894
02:56:48,820 --> 02:56:50,180
He was just like...

2895
02:56:50,180 --> 02:56:56,680
He was like, yeah, I guess I'll stand in this pentagram.

2896
02:56:58,780 --> 02:57:00,940
He was probably like Matrix dodging.

2897
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:03,080
He was going so fast, we couldn't even tell though.

2898
02:57:03,920 --> 02:57:05,400
His faith is strong.

2899
02:57:05,980 --> 02:57:07,360
Gosh, we all need to be more like him.

2900
02:57:07,360 --> 02:57:08,320
Like Father Garcia.

2901
02:57:16,200 --> 02:57:17,500
That was fun.

2902
02:57:18,180 --> 02:57:18,960
That was fun.

2903
02:57:19,860 --> 02:57:23,140
I can't remember how long it took me the first time I played these.

2904
02:57:23,740 --> 02:57:24,940
For the first two chapters.

2905
02:57:26,940 --> 02:57:30,020
But, I think I went faster than I did before.

2906
02:57:30,180 --> 02:57:31,200
I don't know, actually I can't tell.

2907
02:57:31,720 --> 02:57:32,760
Maybe I was about the same.

2908
02:57:32,760 --> 02:57:33,660
I like to walk around.

2909
02:57:33,660 --> 02:57:36,640
Well, I did talk a lot at the very beginning of the stream.

2910
02:57:37,580 --> 02:57:38,520
I talked a lot.

2911
02:57:38,820 --> 02:57:40,800
I was like on the first note of the game.

2912
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,920
I was literally on the instructions and just yapping away.

2913
02:57:44,420 --> 02:57:45,380
Excited for 3.0.

2914
02:57:45,560 --> 02:57:46,780
Thank you, Kasha.

2915
02:57:47,160 --> 02:57:48,800
Bro, thank you.

2916
02:57:52,400 --> 02:57:53,700
Definitely feels faster.

2917
02:57:55,700 --> 02:57:57,160
Tri-princess, thank you.

2918
02:57:57,380 --> 02:57:58,460
Ducky, thanks for the bomb gifter.

2919
02:57:59,060 --> 02:58:03,140
I offer a prayer that your 3.0 debut goes well for you.

2920
02:58:03,260 --> 02:58:04,020
Thank you.

2921
02:58:04,660 --> 02:58:06,300
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited.

2922
02:58:06,920 --> 02:58:07,940
So excited.

2923
02:58:08,780 --> 02:58:11,480
I'm like, I wanted to obviously come so much quicker.

2924
02:58:11,600 --> 02:58:14,700
But, obviously I have so much that needs to be finished too.

2925
02:58:16,520 --> 02:58:18,260
So, not too fast.

2926
02:58:18,680 --> 02:58:19,540
Not too fast.

2927
02:58:19,840 --> 02:58:22,600
I did tell the people, my team.

2928
02:58:23,420 --> 02:58:25,680
I have two teams that I'm working with on stuff.

2929
02:58:27,140 --> 02:58:33,940
And for one of them, I was like, if you guys need me to delay the debut, I will.

2930
02:58:34,220 --> 02:58:36,520
But, you know, it's kind of sad because I chose Halloween.

2931
02:58:39,880 --> 02:58:41,880
But, if I have to, I would.

2932
02:58:42,240 --> 02:58:42,680
It's just...

2933
02:58:43,560 --> 02:58:44,520
Hopefully, I don't have to.

2934
02:58:44,700 --> 02:58:49,680
But, I would much rather have their health over a date.

2935
02:58:50,320 --> 02:58:54,660
You know, that I want for my debut.

2936
02:58:54,660 --> 02:58:55,560
You know what I mean?

2937
02:58:59,820 --> 02:59:02,840
So, I think I talked about this before on stream.

2938
02:59:03,500 --> 02:59:04,860
Maybe it was a member's stream.

2939
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:05,540
I can't remember.

2940
02:59:06,340 --> 02:59:07,940
No, I think it was just a normal stream.

2941
02:59:08,020 --> 02:59:08,820
But, I was like, you know.

2942
02:59:11,620 --> 02:59:14,730
Because one of the artists had some health issues.

2943
02:59:15,840 --> 02:59:18,340
I was like, girl, just tell me.

2944
02:59:18,420 --> 02:59:19,360
I will delay it.

2945
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:24,140
I will just pretend it's Halloween.

2946
02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:27,260
Like, two days later or something.

2947
02:59:27,380 --> 02:59:27,820
I don't know.

2948
02:59:31,460 --> 02:59:32,020
So...

2949
02:59:32,020 --> 02:59:32,420
Yeah.

2950
02:59:32,980 --> 02:59:34,360
Minto is anti-crunch.

2951
02:59:35,080 --> 02:59:35,660
I just...

2952
02:59:37,040 --> 02:59:38,160
It's just...

2953
02:59:38,160 --> 02:59:38,940
I don't know.

2954
02:59:39,040 --> 02:59:40,140
It's just not...

2955
02:59:40,140 --> 02:59:41,160
It wouldn't be worth it.

2956
02:59:41,300 --> 02:59:42,300
I would feel so bad.

2957
02:59:43,100 --> 02:59:46,140
We'll see what they say closer to the date, so...

2958
02:59:46,140 --> 02:59:49,420
But, I will have some special guests.

2959
02:59:51,260 --> 02:59:52,380
During my...

2960
02:59:52,380 --> 02:59:53,980
During the debut.

2961
02:59:55,380 --> 02:59:57,840
Some special people recorded things for me.

2962
02:59:59,040 --> 02:59:59,600
So...

2963
02:59:59,600 --> 03:00:02,760
I'm still waiting on three recordings.

2964
03:00:03,740 --> 03:00:05,520
But, if they happen and they happen.

2965
03:00:05,640 --> 03:00:06,600
If they don't, that's okay too.

2966
03:00:07,200 --> 03:00:07,920
Everybody's busy.

2967
03:00:09,020 --> 03:00:09,800
But, I'll announce...

2968
03:00:11,520 --> 03:00:13,100
Who the guests are...

2969
03:00:13,100 --> 03:00:14,080
Closer to the date.

2970
03:00:16,740 --> 03:00:18,760
There was one guest I really wanted.

2971
03:00:22,480 --> 03:00:23,040
But...

2972
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:23,880
I...

2973
03:00:23,880 --> 03:00:25,320
Don't think there's enough time.

2974
03:00:26,360 --> 03:00:29,060
I will try for a future thing.

2975
03:00:38,110 --> 03:00:38,590
But...

2976
03:00:39,210 --> 03:00:39,690
Kiwawa.

2977
03:00:40,550 --> 03:00:41,030
Lilac.

2978
03:00:41,270 --> 03:00:41,790
Oh my god.

2979
03:00:41,950 --> 03:00:42,790
David Hayter.

2980
03:00:44,050 --> 03:00:46,790
You'll have to come to the debut to find out.

2981
03:00:48,690 --> 03:00:49,350
Thank you!

2982
03:00:50,430 --> 03:00:51,130
Chapter 2.

2983
03:00:51,170 --> 03:00:51,470
Awesome.

2984
03:00:51,610 --> 03:00:52,510
First try was impressive.

2985
03:00:52,670 --> 03:00:53,410
Nice gaming, Minto.

2986
03:00:53,550 --> 03:00:54,570
And thanks for the laughs today.

2987
03:00:54,690 --> 03:00:55,870
3.01 week to go.

2988
03:00:56,070 --> 03:00:56,370
Hype!

2989
03:00:56,370 --> 03:00:57,490
Hype!

2990
03:00:57,710 --> 03:00:58,310
Thank you!

2991
03:00:59,670 --> 03:01:00,910
Thank you, thank you.

2992
03:01:01,970 --> 03:01:02,530
Kojima.

2993
03:01:02,930 --> 03:01:03,270
Yeah.

2994
03:01:04,390 --> 03:01:05,730
You'll have to see it.

2995
03:01:08,550 --> 03:01:12,110
I heard of people hanging Christmas decorations weeks ago.

2996
03:01:12,270 --> 03:01:14,730
I think it's fair that you can extend Halloween if you need to.

2997
03:01:15,210 --> 03:01:18,490
I went to the store and there was already a Christmas section.

2998
03:01:18,630 --> 03:01:19,390
I was so angry.

2999
03:01:20,170 --> 03:01:22,050
I was like, excuse me?

3000
03:01:22,250 --> 03:01:24,690
They had advent calendars and stuff.

3001
03:01:24,690 --> 03:01:26,410
I was like, no, no, no.

3002
03:01:26,890 --> 03:01:27,730
Not yet.

3003
03:01:28,590 --> 03:01:29,550
Not yet.

3004
03:01:30,390 --> 03:01:33,310
They can't even wait for Halloween day to pass.

3005
03:01:33,390 --> 03:01:34,310
It's so frustrating.

3006
03:01:35,870 --> 03:01:37,570
It's so frustrating.

3007
03:01:41,630 --> 03:01:42,910
It's not over yet.

3008
03:01:43,090 --> 03:01:43,450
Christmas.

3009
03:01:45,710 --> 03:01:47,690
I saw Christmas stuff in September.

3010
03:01:48,590 --> 03:01:49,390
That's insane.

3011
03:01:49,530 --> 03:01:52,370
And then Spirit Halloween will turn into Spirit Christmas.

3012
03:01:54,350 --> 03:01:55,330
It's not going to be...

3013
03:01:56,370 --> 03:01:57,950
It's not going to feel the same.

3014
03:01:58,550 --> 03:01:59,390
Spirit Christmas.

3015
03:02:01,270 --> 03:02:01,990
I love...

3016
03:02:01,990 --> 03:02:03,810
I went to a Spirit Halloween the other day.

3017
03:02:04,450 --> 03:02:06,710
Because I was just like, I want to feel like it's Halloween.

3018
03:02:07,310 --> 03:02:08,550
So I just went inside.

3019
03:02:09,250 --> 03:02:10,370
And like saw the...

3020
03:02:11,870 --> 03:02:12,590
Oh my gosh.

3021
03:02:12,650 --> 03:02:13,610
They had...

3022
03:02:13,610 --> 03:02:14,370
What's that new...

3023
03:02:16,190 --> 03:02:17,030
That new...

3024
03:02:17,030 --> 03:02:19,730
The third movie of it just came out.

3025
03:02:21,250 --> 03:02:23,650
Mariah Carey is coming to thaw out your new model.

3026
03:02:24,870 --> 03:02:25,450
That's me.

3027
03:02:25,970 --> 03:02:26,970
I'm Mariah Carey.

3028
03:02:27,190 --> 03:02:27,950
Oh, Terrifier.

3029
03:02:28,170 --> 03:02:29,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3030
03:02:30,630 --> 03:02:31,130
Terrifier.

3031
03:02:32,010 --> 03:02:32,710
Art the Clown.

3032
03:02:32,790 --> 03:02:33,310
Is that his name?

3033
03:02:34,030 --> 03:02:36,850
I too saw giant Christmas displays in September in Costco.

3034
03:02:37,250 --> 03:02:37,750
Infuriating.

3035
03:02:37,850 --> 03:02:38,650
That's the worst.

3036
03:02:40,970 --> 03:02:42,230
Can I hit the high notes?

3037
03:02:43,070 --> 03:02:44,630
Oh, Mariah Carey's high notes?

3038
03:02:45,850 --> 03:02:47,610
If I warmed up maybe.

3039
03:02:49,290 --> 03:02:50,650
If I warmed up maybe.

3040
03:02:52,790 --> 03:02:53,150
I...

3041
03:02:54,130 --> 03:02:56,290
Will have to do a Christmas karaoke then.

3042
03:02:57,290 --> 03:03:00,210
I work at a grocery store and corporate already put up Christmas decor.

3043
03:03:00,390 --> 03:03:01,410
It's so sad.

3044
03:03:04,430 --> 03:03:05,570
Thanks for spooky time intel.

3045
03:03:05,670 --> 03:03:09,770
By the way, I asked David Kaye to sing you the MGS5 version of Happy Birthday.

3046
03:03:09,890 --> 03:03:11,050
But I don't think he knew what it was.

3047
03:03:11,150 --> 03:03:11,510
Where's the shot?

3048
03:03:11,710 --> 03:03:12,070
Oh!

3049
03:03:12,490 --> 03:03:13,710
I want to watch that.

3050
03:03:13,830 --> 03:03:14,390
Wait, hold on.

3051
03:03:18,130 --> 03:03:18,610
Sorry.

3052
03:03:19,110 --> 03:03:20,610
I actually didn't finish.

3053
03:03:20,750 --> 03:03:22,550
I watched just a tiny bit of it.

3054
03:03:22,850 --> 03:03:23,350
Okay, barn.

3055
03:03:23,750 --> 03:03:26,630
And then I was like, oh, I want to watch the rest of it on stream.

3056
03:03:27,610 --> 03:03:29,850
So you can get my real reaction.

3057
03:03:30,270 --> 03:03:31,870
Hold on, let me...

3058
03:03:31,870 --> 03:03:32,610
Let me...

3059
03:03:35,050 --> 03:03:36,010
Let me...

3060
03:03:36,010 --> 03:03:37,790
Let me...

3061
03:03:37,790 --> 03:03:38,270
Find it.

3062
03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:48,200
Oh my gosh.

3063
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:51,380
You guys, I know you like lilac.

3064
03:03:51,460 --> 03:03:54,080
But try not to be so mean about it.

3065
03:03:54,760 --> 03:03:56,600
When you do stuff like this.

3066
03:03:56,640 --> 03:03:57,420
Hold on.

3067
03:03:57,580 --> 03:03:59,080
This is so mean.

3068
03:04:00,200 --> 03:04:02,360
I just went to my tag.

3069
03:04:02,520 --> 03:04:04,060
My art tag.

3070
03:04:04,260 --> 03:04:05,940
I see stuff like this.

3071
03:04:07,300 --> 03:04:09,040
Like this is just mean.

3072
03:04:09,160 --> 03:04:10,780
This is just mean.

3073
03:04:12,040 --> 03:04:13,200
Don't be rude.

3074
03:04:13,560 --> 03:04:14,200
Don't be like...

3075
03:04:16,220 --> 03:04:18,980
Oh, lilac is so much better than mint.

3076
03:04:19,180 --> 03:04:20,060
Don't be rude.

3077
03:04:20,140 --> 03:04:20,900
Okay, about it.

3078
03:04:20,960 --> 03:04:23,380
I know that you guys like...

3079
03:04:23,380 --> 03:04:26,920
It makes me feel like you don't like how I look.

3080
03:04:26,940 --> 03:04:28,280
It makes me so sad.

3081
03:04:32,400 --> 03:04:35,080
It makes me feel like you guys think I'm ugly.

3082
03:04:42,540 --> 03:04:44,380
Don't be so rude about it.

3083
03:04:44,480 --> 03:04:44,660
Okay.

3084
03:04:44,660 --> 03:04:46,180
Don't be so mean.

3085
03:04:46,240 --> 03:04:46,860
My feelings.

3086
03:04:47,080 --> 03:04:49,080
I'm a sensitive...

3087
03:04:49,080 --> 03:04:50,700
I'm a sensitive ghost.

3088
03:04:50,820 --> 03:04:51,020
Okay.

3089
03:04:55,260 --> 03:04:56,060
One second.

3090
03:04:56,580 --> 03:04:57,360
Hold on.

3091
03:04:57,400 --> 03:04:58,580
Let me change this.

3092
03:05:01,480 --> 03:05:03,480
Wait, how do I change?

3093
03:05:03,680 --> 03:05:04,600
Hold on.

3094
03:05:06,640 --> 03:05:07,240
Wait.

3095
03:05:07,740 --> 03:05:09,100
Why is...

3096
03:05:09,660 --> 03:05:11,560
Why is Twitter the way that it is?

3097
03:05:11,720 --> 03:05:12,860
It's just so...

3098
03:05:12,860 --> 03:05:13,940
It's so bad.

3099
03:05:15,680 --> 03:05:16,540
Oh, here we go.

3100
03:05:16,800 --> 03:05:17,040
Okay.

3101
03:05:20,820 --> 03:05:21,300
Okay.

3102
03:05:21,940 --> 03:05:23,200
Let me pull it up.

3103
03:05:24,120 --> 03:05:25,120
Mint is my favorite.

3104
03:05:25,460 --> 03:05:26,020
Thank you.

3105
03:05:30,820 --> 03:05:33,660
I think it's just getting to me because it's so...

3106
03:05:34,280 --> 03:05:36,300
You know, at first I was just like...

3107
03:05:36,300 --> 03:05:39,500
And then it became so many things where it's like...

3108
03:05:39,500 --> 03:05:40,840
Lilac is cuter than mint.

3109
03:05:41,180 --> 03:05:42,760
Oh, lilac is better than mint.

3110
03:05:42,820 --> 03:05:43,420
And I'm like...

3111
03:05:43,420 --> 03:05:44,780
But I'm mint!

3112
03:05:45,060 --> 03:05:46,620
But I'm mint!

3113
03:05:50,680 --> 03:05:52,840
What about valley girl demon?

3114
03:05:57,330 --> 03:05:58,330
Oh my god.

3115
03:05:59,150 --> 03:06:01,410
Are you like obsessed with me?

3116
03:06:01,670 --> 03:06:02,910
That's like so crazy.

3117
03:06:03,690 --> 03:06:05,010
You can't be obsessed with a demon.

3118
03:06:05,450 --> 03:06:07,210
Do you want to like make a contract with me?

3119
03:06:07,450 --> 03:06:07,990
Oh my god.

3120
03:06:09,330 --> 03:06:10,070
Oh my god.

3121
03:06:10,170 --> 03:06:10,330
Okay.

3122
03:06:10,950 --> 03:06:14,230
So, you just got to sign your name on the line.

3123
03:06:14,230 --> 03:06:16,150
And then I can make like a wish come true.

3124
03:06:16,270 --> 03:06:17,710
But then I get your soul.

3125
03:06:18,210 --> 03:06:18,650
Whoa.

3126
03:06:19,410 --> 03:06:21,190
Okay, but that's not like until you die.

3127
03:06:21,430 --> 03:06:22,350
Which could be tomorrow.

3128
03:06:22,350 --> 03:06:23,170
But you don't know.

3129
03:06:23,370 --> 03:06:25,530
You have to live your life to the fullest.

3130
03:06:25,810 --> 03:06:26,550
Like while you can.

3131
03:06:26,750 --> 03:06:26,950
Okay?

3132
03:06:27,310 --> 03:06:28,330
Live every life.

3133
03:06:28,810 --> 03:06:29,670
Every day.

3134
03:06:30,050 --> 03:06:33,190
Like you signed over your soul to a demon.

3135
03:06:33,550 --> 03:06:35,710
And you have to live it to the fullest.

3136
03:06:35,750 --> 03:06:38,150
Because once you die, I will get your soul.

3137
03:06:38,290 --> 03:06:39,230
And then like...

3138
03:06:40,550 --> 03:06:41,930
It'll be miserable.

3139
03:06:41,930 --> 03:06:44,250
And you'll be burning in hell for all of eternity.

3140
03:06:45,910 --> 03:06:46,410
Crazy.

3141
03:06:50,390 --> 03:06:51,990
But like, for real.

3142
03:06:52,590 --> 03:06:53,750
Do you want to make a contract with me?

3143
03:06:54,090 --> 03:06:54,390
Okay.

3144
03:06:54,750 --> 03:06:55,690
Where do I sign?

3145
03:06:55,890 --> 03:06:56,750
You're so crazy.

3146
03:06:57,330 --> 03:06:58,030
Oh my gosh.

3147
03:06:58,090 --> 03:06:59,710
Josh, you're so wacky.

3148
03:06:59,970 --> 03:07:00,750
Oh my gosh.

3149
03:07:00,750 --> 03:07:02,610
It's Josh's era right now.

3150
03:07:05,290 --> 03:07:07,930
Do you need this in blood or...

3151
03:07:09,250 --> 03:07:09,750
Whatever.

3152
03:07:10,190 --> 03:07:11,590
Yeah, probably in blood.

3153
03:07:11,970 --> 03:07:12,590
Is what they want.

3154
03:07:12,750 --> 03:07:12,950
Yeah.

3155
03:07:13,770 --> 03:07:14,130
Cool.

3156
03:07:15,410 --> 03:07:16,130
Yeah, probably.

3157
03:07:16,790 --> 03:07:16,990
Yeah.

3158
03:07:17,090 --> 03:07:17,490
Is that okay?

3159
03:07:18,370 --> 03:07:19,410
Just a little finger prick.

3160
03:07:20,330 --> 03:07:21,030
Just like that.

3161
03:07:21,190 --> 03:07:21,410
You know?

3162
03:07:21,590 --> 03:07:22,290
Just a little...

3163
03:07:22,290 --> 03:07:24,130
It like barely hurts.

3164
03:07:24,190 --> 03:07:26,330
But for me, I'm going to pass out if I look at it.

3165
03:07:26,370 --> 03:07:27,930
So like, don't do it in front of me.

3166
03:07:28,410 --> 03:07:29,650
I'll like turn around and close my eyes.

3167
03:07:29,710 --> 03:07:30,350
You tell me when you're done.

3168
03:07:30,410 --> 03:07:30,550
Okay?

3169
03:07:31,770 --> 03:07:32,750
I wish for a hold...

3170
03:07:33,290 --> 03:07:33,530
Wait.

3171
03:07:33,950 --> 03:07:34,190
Hat?

3172
03:07:34,330 --> 03:07:35,070
Oh my gosh.

3173
03:07:35,190 --> 03:07:36,490
I can't believe I messed that up.

3174
03:07:37,330 --> 03:07:38,130
I can't like...

3175
03:07:38,130 --> 03:07:39,350
I can't like even read.

3176
03:07:39,350 --> 03:07:42,110
I wish for hand holding with Minto.

3177
03:07:42,190 --> 03:07:44,750
That's like so lewd, Brian.

3178
03:07:44,990 --> 03:07:45,250
Wow.

3179
03:07:45,310 --> 03:07:46,490
You belong in hell.

3180
03:07:47,050 --> 03:07:47,530
Wow.

3181
03:07:47,950 --> 03:07:48,570
Oh my God.

3182
03:07:48,730 --> 03:07:50,310
You're going there for sure.

3183
03:07:50,810 --> 03:07:51,450
What a degenerate.

3184
03:07:52,270 --> 03:07:52,990
Oh my gosh.

3185
03:07:53,010 --> 03:07:54,530
I can't believe you typed that on the internet.

3186
03:07:55,550 --> 03:07:56,030
Wow.

3187
03:07:56,550 --> 03:07:57,550
Why are you so good at this?

3188
03:07:57,610 --> 03:07:58,650
Because it's like...

3189
03:07:58,650 --> 03:07:59,370
Me.

3190
03:07:59,690 --> 03:07:59,830
Okay.

3191
03:08:02,190 --> 03:08:04,110
This is like who I am.

3192
03:08:04,250 --> 03:08:04,430
Okay.

3193
03:08:07,170 --> 03:08:07,650
So...

3194
03:08:07,650 --> 03:08:08,790
It's suspiciously good.

3195
03:08:08,790 --> 03:08:10,610
I've only like made like...

3196
03:08:10,610 --> 03:08:10,970
I don't know.

3197
03:08:11,330 --> 03:08:15,450
Like three, four hundred contracts or something.

3198
03:08:15,610 --> 03:08:15,790
You know?

3199
03:08:15,890 --> 03:08:16,230
Like whatever.

3200
03:08:16,570 --> 03:08:18,770
People are just so willing to like...

3201
03:08:18,770 --> 03:08:19,070
I don't know.

3202
03:08:19,130 --> 03:08:20,470
I think I'm just charismatic.

3203
03:08:21,050 --> 03:08:21,670
It's like...

3204
03:08:21,670 --> 03:08:22,790
I go up to people and I'm like...

3205
03:08:22,790 --> 03:08:23,610
You want to make a contract?

3206
03:08:23,790 --> 03:08:24,470
And they're like...

3207
03:08:24,470 --> 03:08:25,690
Oh, she seems nice.

3208
03:08:25,810 --> 03:08:26,130
And I'm like...

3209
03:08:26,130 --> 03:08:26,490
I know.

3210
03:08:27,010 --> 03:08:28,390
I am so nice.

3211
03:08:28,530 --> 03:08:30,170
I'm like the nicest demon they'll ever meet.

3212
03:08:30,430 --> 03:08:32,330
And then they just sign their name.

3213
03:08:32,530 --> 03:08:32,810
They're like...

3214
03:08:32,810 --> 03:08:33,890
I didn't read the fine print.

3215
03:08:34,010 --> 03:08:34,250
And I'm like...

3216
03:08:34,250 --> 03:08:34,870
It's fine.

3217
03:08:35,210 --> 03:08:35,710
You know?

3218
03:08:35,950 --> 03:08:36,850
Eternity in hell.

3219
03:08:36,850 --> 03:08:37,190
Whatever.

3220
03:08:37,450 --> 03:08:37,750
Blah blah blah.

3221
03:08:37,830 --> 03:08:38,230
Fire.

3222
03:08:38,730 --> 03:08:39,250
Whatever.

3223
03:08:39,730 --> 03:08:40,210
You're like...

3224
03:08:40,210 --> 03:08:41,850
Hanging from your toenails.

3225
03:08:42,090 --> 03:08:43,830
All that fun stuff in hell.

3226
03:08:44,430 --> 03:08:44,950
Crazy!

3227
03:08:46,070 --> 03:08:48,630
It's kind of exciting though if you've never tried it before.

3228
03:08:48,990 --> 03:08:49,510
But...

3229
03:08:49,510 --> 03:08:50,630
You know.

3230
03:08:50,750 --> 03:08:51,270
It's like...

3231
03:08:51,610 --> 03:08:52,870
Just kind of one of those things.

3232
03:08:53,370 --> 03:08:53,650
Anyway.

3233
03:08:53,810 --> 03:08:53,970
Right?

3234
03:08:54,110 --> 03:08:54,450
Crazy!

3235
03:08:54,850 --> 03:08:55,410
So crazy.

3236
03:08:55,650 --> 03:08:56,830
Father Garcia is shaking.

3237
03:08:57,030 --> 03:08:57,930
That's because he like...

3238
03:08:57,930 --> 03:08:58,970
Knows how real I am.

3239
03:08:59,470 --> 03:09:00,190
I'm like...

3240
03:09:00,750 --> 03:09:04,330
In my realist era of demonhood.

3241
03:09:04,830 --> 03:09:05,950
Demon girls!

3242
03:09:06,870 --> 03:09:07,830
We're crazy!

3243
03:09:08,250 --> 03:09:09,290
We're like...

3244
03:09:09,290 --> 03:09:10,130
Oh my gosh.

3245
03:09:10,250 --> 03:09:11,970
I got a pumpkin spice latte.

3246
03:09:12,470 --> 03:09:13,110
And I went...

3247
03:09:13,110 --> 03:09:13,610
Wow!

3248
03:09:14,770 --> 03:09:15,250
Spicy!

3249
03:09:16,630 --> 03:09:17,910
For the season!

3250
03:09:19,090 --> 03:09:20,130
What's your insta?

3251
03:09:20,610 --> 03:09:21,370
Oh my gosh.

3252
03:09:21,410 --> 03:09:22,590
You're trying to get my gram?

3253
03:09:22,790 --> 03:09:23,130
I don't know.

3254
03:09:23,230 --> 03:09:23,950
I don't really like...

3255
03:09:24,550 --> 03:09:25,330
I feel like...

3256
03:09:25,330 --> 03:09:25,670
You know.

3257
03:09:25,710 --> 03:09:26,890
When I go on hikes.

3258
03:09:27,210 --> 03:09:29,310
And when I eat babies sometimes.

3259
03:09:29,870 --> 03:09:30,350
Like...

3260
03:09:30,350 --> 03:09:32,110
Just the normal demon things.

3261
03:09:32,190 --> 03:09:33,630
It's all boring.

3262
03:09:34,110 --> 03:09:34,650
You don't want it.

3263
03:09:34,650 --> 03:09:36,550
You don't want my instagram?

3264
03:09:37,890 --> 03:09:38,410
Wow.

3265
03:09:39,070 --> 03:09:39,530
Wow.

3266
03:09:39,950 --> 03:09:41,330
What's an infernal patron?

3267
03:09:41,910 --> 03:09:42,130
Wait.

3268
03:09:42,470 --> 03:09:42,730
With...

3269
03:09:42,730 --> 03:09:44,010
I can't even read.

3270
03:09:44,170 --> 03:09:44,530
Gosh.

3271
03:09:44,650 --> 03:09:45,130
Sorry guys.

3272
03:09:45,170 --> 03:09:45,790
I'm so kooky.

3273
03:09:46,090 --> 03:09:48,290
With an infernal patron this kooky.

3274
03:09:48,450 --> 03:09:49,430
How could I not sign?

3275
03:09:49,590 --> 03:09:50,790
That's what I'm saying.

3276
03:09:50,850 --> 03:09:51,270
Like I said.

3277
03:09:51,450 --> 03:09:52,670
Just to think of it as like...

3278
03:09:53,610 --> 03:09:54,830
Like a vacation.

3279
03:09:55,210 --> 03:09:56,230
That lasts forever.

3280
03:09:56,910 --> 03:09:58,170
It's like really hot.

3281
03:09:58,430 --> 03:09:59,870
But just think of it like...

3282
03:09:59,870 --> 03:10:00,590
Florida.

3283
03:10:01,250 --> 03:10:01,750
Wow.

3284
03:10:04,430 --> 03:10:04,910
Disney.

3285
03:10:06,730 --> 03:10:07,210
Miami.

3286
03:10:09,390 --> 03:10:10,890
I always wanted to go to Miami.

3287
03:10:11,170 --> 03:10:12,970
Because of CSI.

3288
03:10:14,670 --> 03:10:20,170
Valley girl de momento I am most enamored with thee and have come to ask her hand in marriage.

3289
03:10:20,330 --> 03:10:21,710
I offer thee this green soup.

3290
03:10:21,950 --> 03:10:22,850
Green like the highlands.

3291
03:10:23,090 --> 03:10:24,690
Okay but like...

3292
03:10:24,690 --> 03:10:26,730
I can't really do anything with marriage.

3293
03:10:27,170 --> 03:10:28,850
It's like not really my thing.

3294
03:10:29,850 --> 03:10:31,730
Unless it's like an unholy marriage.

3295
03:10:31,730 --> 03:10:36,550
the whole holy thing is kind of a drag.

3296
03:10:36,730 --> 03:10:37,990
I can't really do that.

3297
03:10:38,730 --> 03:10:39,290
You know what I mean?

3298
03:10:39,350 --> 03:10:40,230
Because I'm a demon.

3299
03:10:40,870 --> 03:10:43,110
It's just kind of...

3300
03:10:44,290 --> 03:10:44,850
Yeah.

3301
03:10:46,730 --> 03:10:47,290
Yeah.

3302
03:10:48,070 --> 03:10:48,870
You know.

3303
03:10:51,390 --> 03:10:54,290
But if you like sign this contract with your blood.

3304
03:10:54,810 --> 03:10:55,930
It could be like a thing.

3305
03:10:56,030 --> 03:10:56,970
It's just not marriage.

3306
03:10:56,970 --> 03:10:58,770
It's just a contract.

3307
03:10:59,310 --> 03:11:00,730
Basically the same thing.

3308
03:11:00,830 --> 03:11:01,150
You know?

3309
03:11:04,930 --> 03:11:06,410
What's with the salt?

3310
03:11:06,590 --> 03:11:07,090
Tasty.

3311
03:11:07,330 --> 03:11:07,950
Om nom nom nom.

3312
03:11:08,310 --> 03:11:10,550
I'm actually trying to watch my salt intake.

3313
03:11:10,870 --> 03:11:13,370
I went to like the demonologist the other day.

3314
03:11:13,430 --> 03:11:14,950
And they were like, Whoa girly.

3315
03:11:15,230 --> 03:11:19,670
You are having way too many fries lately.

3316
03:11:19,670 --> 03:11:21,750
And I'm like, Okay doctor.

3317
03:11:22,010 --> 03:11:22,890
Like I know.

3318
03:11:23,030 --> 03:11:24,070
I need to watch my figure.

3319
03:11:24,950 --> 03:11:26,310
I need to watch my salt intake.

3320
03:11:26,810 --> 03:11:30,010
I'm like not a carb girl right now.

3321
03:11:30,130 --> 03:11:30,430
Okay.

3322
03:11:30,630 --> 03:11:31,110
So.

3323
03:11:31,910 --> 03:11:32,430
Yeah.

3324
03:11:32,430 --> 03:11:36,010
I have to not eat all the salt.

3325
03:11:36,330 --> 03:11:36,810
Sorry.

3326
03:11:37,270 --> 03:11:39,210
Thanks for offering though.

3327
03:11:40,730 --> 03:11:42,250
Gonna slide into your DMs.

3328
03:11:42,270 --> 03:11:43,730
AKA demon messages.

3329
03:11:44,610 --> 03:11:46,590
Oh my gosh.

3330
03:11:47,650 --> 03:11:49,030
Oh my gosh.

3331
03:11:49,190 --> 03:11:49,570
Wow.

3332
03:11:52,390 --> 03:11:53,530
Turns off my DMs.

3333
03:11:54,110 --> 03:11:54,930
Thank you.

3334
03:11:55,930 --> 03:11:56,230
Okay.

3335
03:11:56,290 --> 03:11:57,650
I think I'm done with this bit.

3336
03:11:57,790 --> 03:11:58,230
Is that okay?

3337
03:11:58,510 --> 03:12:00,830
Is it alright if I like end this bit and watch the thing?

3338
03:12:00,930 --> 03:12:01,110
Oh.

3339
03:12:01,110 --> 03:12:02,090
I was gonna watch this.

3340
03:12:02,150 --> 03:12:03,110
Hold on.

3341
03:12:06,050 --> 03:12:06,970
Window.

3342
03:12:08,470 --> 03:12:09,390
Capture.

3343
03:12:25,930 --> 03:12:28,110
There we go.

3344
03:12:30,390 --> 03:12:30,630
Wait.

3345
03:12:30,890 --> 03:12:33,030
Let's crop more.

3346
03:12:33,650 --> 03:12:34,450
Make bigger.

3347
03:12:35,110 --> 03:12:35,830
There we go.

3348
03:12:36,510 --> 03:12:36,810
Okay.

3349
03:12:36,810 --> 03:12:37,150
Yay!

3350
03:12:37,330 --> 03:12:42,790
Kvarn got this cameo for me for my birthday.

3351
03:12:43,150 --> 03:12:45,810
But I never saw it until today.

3352
03:12:46,430 --> 03:12:47,890
And so we're gonna watch it.

3353
03:12:48,250 --> 03:12:49,970
And I didn't watch the whole thing.

3354
03:12:50,150 --> 03:12:51,010
So I'm very excited.

3355
03:12:51,010 --> 03:12:53,230
I watched like a couple seconds of it.

3356
03:12:53,290 --> 03:12:53,810
So I'm excited.

3357
03:12:53,990 --> 03:12:54,110
Okay.

3358
03:12:54,290 --> 03:12:54,950
Here we go!

3359
03:12:55,930 --> 03:12:57,530
Mint, David K.

3360
03:12:58,170 --> 03:12:58,410
Wars.

3361
03:12:58,850 --> 03:13:03,770
Maybe you might better recognize this character.

3362
03:13:04,430 --> 03:13:06,010
Beast Wars Megatron.

3363
03:13:06,070 --> 03:13:07,370
Okay, this is where I watched up to.

3364
03:13:07,790 --> 03:13:09,430
So without further ado...

3365
03:13:09,810 --> 03:13:10,710
It's your birthday.

3366
03:13:10,910 --> 03:13:11,710
It was!

3367
03:13:11,870 --> 03:13:13,610
From the Wisps and myself.

3368
03:13:14,990 --> 03:13:16,510
Happy birthday to you.

3369
03:13:16,750 --> 03:13:18,950
Happy birthday to you.

3370
03:13:18,990 --> 03:13:19,430
Yes!

3371
03:13:19,510 --> 03:13:22,070
Happy birthday dear Mint.

3372
03:13:22,830 --> 03:13:24,630
A good Predacon name.

3373
03:13:25,370 --> 03:13:27,290
Happy birthday to you.

3374
03:13:29,210 --> 03:13:30,230
Have a great one.

3375
03:13:30,570 --> 03:13:31,850
It doesn't say how old you are.

3376
03:13:32,150 --> 03:13:34,390
I imagine you're 21.

3377
03:13:34,730 --> 03:13:35,090
21!

3378
03:13:35,710 --> 03:13:36,030
But anyway.

3379
03:13:36,190 --> 03:13:36,410
Cool.

3380
03:13:37,190 --> 03:13:39,610
Have a great day on your birthday.

3381
03:13:39,670 --> 03:13:40,090
Thank you!

3382
03:13:40,170 --> 03:13:43,430
And thank you the Wisps for allowing me to do this.

3383
03:13:43,750 --> 03:13:45,590
And this is just a peek into the studio.

3384
03:13:45,950 --> 03:13:47,070
I'm gonna do my work this morning.

3385
03:13:47,070 --> 03:13:51,390
It looks like I have to do some work right now.

3386
03:13:51,390 --> 03:13:51,890
Some work.

3387
03:13:51,910 --> 03:13:52,930
So I gotta get back to it.

3388
03:13:52,970 --> 03:13:54,210
Anyway, thank you again.

3389
03:13:54,450 --> 03:13:56,230
Have a great birthday.

3390
03:13:56,390 --> 03:13:57,030
Thank you!

3391
03:13:57,230 --> 03:13:57,670
Excellent.

3392
03:13:58,190 --> 03:13:58,770
Yes.

3393
03:14:00,150 --> 03:14:01,650
Thanks David Kaye!

3394
03:14:01,710 --> 03:14:02,250
Wait, hold on.

3395
03:14:02,730 --> 03:14:03,770
I have to hear it again.

3396
03:14:04,390 --> 03:14:05,870
Happy birthday to you.

3397
03:14:06,410 --> 03:14:08,270
Happy birthday to you.

3398
03:14:08,490 --> 03:14:11,370
Happy birthday dear Mint.

3399
03:14:12,470 --> 03:14:14,030
A good Predacon name.

3400
03:14:14,770 --> 03:14:16,770
Happy birthday to you.

3401
03:14:17,130 --> 03:14:17,770
Yes.

3402
03:14:18,370 --> 03:14:19,490
Have a great one.

3403
03:14:19,490 --> 03:14:20,750
It doesn't say how old.

3404
03:14:20,830 --> 03:14:21,750
Predacon name.

3405
03:14:22,410 --> 03:14:24,470
Happy birthday to you.

3406
03:14:24,890 --> 03:14:25,410
Yes.

3407
03:14:26,430 --> 03:14:27,470
To you.

3408
03:14:28,130 --> 03:14:28,650
Yes.

3409
03:14:29,290 --> 03:14:30,430
Have a great one.

3410
03:14:35,750 --> 03:14:37,350
Thank you Kaye-boy!

3411
03:14:38,930 --> 03:14:39,450
Yes.

3412
03:14:39,470 --> 03:14:40,310
Oh my gosh.

3413
03:14:40,830 --> 03:14:43,010
I wanna watch Beast Wars so bad right now.

3414
03:14:43,650 --> 03:14:44,290
Thank you!

3415
03:14:44,890 --> 03:14:46,330
OK, I'm gonna go now guys.

3416
03:14:46,690 --> 03:14:49,190
Thank you for hanging out with me today for Faze.

3417
03:14:49,190 --> 03:14:49,830
We'll finish.

3418
03:14:50,010 --> 03:14:51,930
We'll do the third game next week.

3419
03:14:52,330 --> 03:14:53,250
Before Halloween.

3420
03:14:57,030 --> 03:14:58,770
Beast Wars watch-along?

3421
03:14:59,030 --> 03:14:59,890
Should we?

3422
03:15:01,950 --> 03:15:03,570
It's hard to find though.

3423
03:15:05,210 --> 03:15:06,330
I don't...

3424
03:15:06,330 --> 03:15:08,510
I think I first watched it on Netflix.

3425
03:15:10,730 --> 03:15:11,470
Titles misleading?

3426
03:15:11,550 --> 03:15:12,650
Minto is still an angel?

3427
03:15:12,770 --> 03:15:15,330
No, I went to heaven and then I left.

3428
03:15:18,110 --> 03:15:18,830
Thank you!

3429
03:15:19,270 --> 03:15:21,590
Thanks for the fun streams of these great games.

3430
03:15:21,690 --> 03:15:24,450
Next week is Raid of Spiders with those cuties.

3431
03:15:24,570 --> 03:15:25,390
Thank you!

3432
03:15:26,250 --> 03:15:26,790
Beasties!

3433
03:15:30,590 --> 03:15:33,050
Oh my gosh, we should do a Beast Wars watch-along.

3434
03:15:33,750 --> 03:15:35,530
It's kinda long though, isn't it?

3435
03:15:37,370 --> 03:15:38,930
We're in outer heaven now.

3436
03:15:42,010 --> 03:15:43,590
Thank you guys!

3437
03:15:43,590 --> 03:15:45,050
Thank you!

3438
03:15:45,210 --> 03:15:46,570
I had so much fun!

3439
03:15:46,630 --> 03:15:48,050
And I'll see you tomorrow.

3440
03:15:48,830 --> 03:15:49,130
Maybe?

3441
03:15:49,890 --> 03:15:51,150
Watch-along I'm begging you.

3442
03:15:52,590 --> 03:15:53,710
Tomorrow is...

3443
03:15:53,710 --> 03:15:53,910
Oh!

3444
03:15:55,230 --> 03:15:58,590
The DLC of Spooky's Mansion.

3445
03:16:01,550 --> 03:16:03,070
Spooky's...Spooky's...Pop-up...Spooky's...Spooky Mansion.

3446
03:16:04,310 --> 03:16:08,870
I finally am getting around to the DLC after I played the game so, so long ago.

3447
03:16:08,870 --> 03:16:13,470
I said that I would play it during Spooky Month and I'm upholding my end of the deal, baby.

3448
03:16:14,750 --> 03:16:16,650
Can we get a little spoiler on the time slot?

3449
03:16:16,770 --> 03:16:17,910
We need to save that day.

3450
03:16:19,550 --> 03:16:20,430
I'm excited.

3451
03:16:20,610 --> 03:16:21,890
Literally can't wait to see your new form.

3452
03:16:22,050 --> 03:16:22,590
Time slot?

3453
03:16:25,110 --> 03:16:25,830
Time slot?

3454
03:16:27,110 --> 03:16:27,990
Time slot.

3455
03:16:30,270 --> 03:16:30,910
Time slot?

3456
03:16:33,250 --> 03:16:34,850
For my 3.0?

3457
03:16:35,350 --> 03:16:36,770
There's a waiting room.

3458
03:16:37,810 --> 03:16:39,490
Yeah, Gliss, there's a waiting room.

3459
03:16:40,370 --> 03:16:41,530
That is already up.

3460
03:16:42,990 --> 03:16:43,390
So...

3461
03:16:43,390 --> 03:16:43,810
Yeah.

3462
03:16:44,430 --> 03:16:45,330
Yeah, for the debut.

3463
03:16:45,450 --> 03:16:45,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3464
03:16:45,990 --> 03:16:47,250
There's a waiting room already up.

3465
03:16:47,370 --> 03:16:48,810
So you can already go see the time.

3466
03:16:49,130 --> 03:16:50,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3467
03:16:52,670 --> 03:16:53,470
Oh, right.

3468
03:16:56,230 --> 03:16:58,550
Yeah, it's not gonna be so long probably.

3469
03:17:01,150 --> 03:17:07,850
So, maybe like two hours because I have the reveal and then some other stuff after.

3470
03:17:08,490 --> 03:17:08,810
Yeah.

3471
03:17:09,170 --> 03:17:13,970
So, you know, it's not gonna be like a whole day event or anything like that.

3472
03:17:16,270 --> 03:17:16,890
Yeah.

3473
03:17:22,830 --> 03:17:24,850
Thank you guys.

3474
03:17:25,110 --> 03:17:27,870
See you tomorrow or when I see you next.

3475
03:17:27,870 --> 03:17:29,110
Itterasshai!

3476
03:17:29,690 --> 03:17:30,530
Bye-bye!

3477
03:17:31,010 --> 03:17:32,070
Bye-bye!

3478
03:17:35,610 --> 03:17:37,670
Take care of yourselves, OK?

3479
03:17:39,910 --> 03:17:40,870
Mortis.
