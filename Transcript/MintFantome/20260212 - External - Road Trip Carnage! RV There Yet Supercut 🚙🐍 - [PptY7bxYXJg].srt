1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
What?

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,980
You gonna pick me up?

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,340
Wait, how do you do that?

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,060
Wait, that was your name, right?

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

6
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:07,820
Whoa!

7
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,160
Whoa!

8
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,000
We're like cheerleaders, I just...

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,880
How do you... Oh my gosh, how do you do that?

10
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,080
Yo!

11
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:16,920
Wow!

12
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,300
Wow!

13
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,340
We all have different glasses!

14
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,660
Yeah!

15
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,200
Nice glasses.

16
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,860
Thank you, nice hat.

17
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,460
You look like Cartman from...

18
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:27,860
You look like Simon.

19
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,220
We should go on a whole camping trip like this sometimes.

20
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:34,920
It's nice.

21
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,020
Yeah!

22
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
Beach ball!

23
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, wait, there's something here.

24
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,020
There's a to-do list.

25
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,120
You guys, our camping trip is over!

26
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,620
Are you okay?

27
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,420
Oh, you're dead.

28
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:53,920
Oh, you're dead.

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:54,600
Oh, you're dead.

30
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,340
Oh, what happened?

31
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,180
What happened?

32
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,380
Hey, roll me.

33
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,180
Oh, oh!

34
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,370
You try now, Phoebe.

35
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,280
You eat the meat.

36
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,090
I try?

37
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,810
Okay, meat tag.

38
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,530
Oh.

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,680
Oh, I'm dizzy.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,930
Do not eat babies.

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,040
Hey, how do we wake you up, Phoebe?

42
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,440
Wake up.

43
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,780
Wake up.

44
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm trying to revive you.

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,940
Wait, Vicky, can you revive her?

46
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,280
Uh-oh.

47
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,860
Press clutch.

48
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,400
What's that mean?

49
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,120
Oh, Phoebe!

50
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,180
It is manual!

51
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,720
I'm lying to!

52
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,100
Can you drive Vanyulmento?

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,060
No!

54
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,330
I've attempted...

55
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,090
Park.

56
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,830
Okay!

57
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,090
Um...

58
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,090
Toggle engine, oh.

59
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:06,860
Oh!

60
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,260
Oh!

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,160
Go home!

62
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,940
Maybe you gotta come in!

63
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,320
Oh, well I'm still wet, I'm still attacked.

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,000
Let me understand.

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,200
Hold on, let's see.

66
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,960
What happens if we drive on while you're attacked?

67
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,020
I'm kind of...

68
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,280
Me too, I'm kind of curious too.

69
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,340
Okay.

70
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,340
All right, run, run far that way.

71
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:33,880
Okay.

72
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm pulling you

73
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,130
away.

74
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,460
All right, you really are stuck.

75
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,340
Oh my god, I'm stuck, stuck.

76
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,540
Here, you can go to the winch.

77
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,820
Okay, I'll sit right where you sit.

78
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,920
I'll reset the winch.

79
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,180
Vicky?

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,580
What?

81
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,160
Oh, oh, oh, jeez.

82
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,640
I'm all over this.

83
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,200
I'm all over now.

84
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,100
Wait.

85
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,460
Our grill!

86
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,020
I did my best.

87
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,620
Oh, my God.

88
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,480
What happened?

89
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,160
What the heck?

90
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,500
What did you guys do?

91
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,140
You guys, I was not here for this.

92
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,540
Okay, yeah, you're right.

93
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,180
You were with me.

94
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,620
Vicky, what did you do?

95
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,640
Oh, our grill.

96
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,980
Are the wind...

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,960
Are the windows smashed?

98
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:52,880
No.

99
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,340
I've never seen the world so trashed.

100
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,980
Oh, oopsie.

101
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,120
Okay, hold up.

102
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,080
Oh, my God.

103
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,180
That's not going to cause it to set on fire, is it?

104
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:03,860
Oh, really?

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,260
Oh, yeah.

106
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,480
Wait, I'm pushing the car.

107
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,320
I'm pushing it.

108
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,100
I think I'm superhuman.

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,860
Let's go.

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,400
This is Densetsu Power.

111
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,640
Wait, how do you push?

112
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:16,960
F.

113
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,060
F.

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,260
Oh, nice, nice.

115
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,640
Hey!

116
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,780
Hey, hey, up!

117
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,320
Hey, hey, up!

118
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,960
It's okay, Vicky.

119
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,800
It was your first time driving manual.

120
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,060
I think I did pretty good for my first time driving.

121
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Yeah.

122
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,900
I wasn't there to see how this happened, but I'm sure you
were just fine.

123
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,060
Wait.

124
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,900
This is not your fault at all.

125
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,240
There was a goblin on the road and you tried to avoid
hitting him.

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,220
Okay, good.

127
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,480
Okay.

128
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,280
Nice.

129
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,140
We're going into one, baby.

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,520
Okay,

131
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,270
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

132
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:06,990
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

133
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,570
Okay, I'm reversing?

134
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,290
You can't straighten out again.

135
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:20,530
All I saw was Vicky get hit by the car and go flying and
then the game was over.

136
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,010
She was the vehicle this whole time.

137
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,590
manual now, everybody.

138
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,270
Oh, we got music?

139
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,410
Is it okay to play the music?

140
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:35,150
Oh.

141
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,170
I know how to do this now.

142
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:48,810
Nice.

143
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,710
This is a bomb.

144
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,850
Uh, uh, uh.

145
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:53,570
Uh.

146
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,530
Hey.

147
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,310
I'm in control.

148
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:58,790
Uh.

149
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,690
I know how to drive me.

150
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,170
Manual.

151
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,450
Watch out for falling, Rock!

152
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,350
We're falling!

153
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,050
Don't worry about it!

154
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,230
Yes, Mr. You're doing great, you're doing amazing!

155
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:18,730
Yes!

156
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,030
Oh, my God.

157
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,550
Oh, my bad.

158
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,190
What the heck?

159
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,610
That

160
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,360
I just...

161
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,840
Okay, you guys, I just up our vehicles value by like
$200,000.

162
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,440
Okay, like...

163
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,840
Yeah, to be fair, probably true.

164
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,820
It's for stargazing and smelling the fresh air.

165
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,540
Yeah!

166
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,600
We don't need to go anywhere.

167
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,480
Oh, what?

168
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,480
Let's go burgle them.

169
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,300
What?

170
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:02,760
I mean...

171
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,860
Yeah, I'm stealing their scrap.

172
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,340
Whoa!

173
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:05,820
Ah!

174
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:06,620
Ah!

175
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,120
That's not a stick!

176
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,620
Oh my god!

177
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,760
Wait, can we eat it?

178
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,980
Can we eat it?

179
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,600
Oh!

180
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,480
Ow!

181
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,820
What the hell?

182
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,360
Is she dead?

183
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,040
Oh, I got the antidote!

184
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
I got the antidote!

185
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,640
Thanks, guys.

186
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,920
Wait, can you take...

187
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,880
Oh, I'm... I don't... Wait.

188
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,660
Let's see if there's a weapon around here.

189
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,080
I got some bear spray.

190
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,020
Maybe that'll work.

191
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,480
Oh, maybe.

192
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,020
Oh my god, that's shaking!

193
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,280
That's

194
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,320
everyone!

195
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,960
Why don't they move though?

196
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,520
Like once they, oh they do kind of, they switch a little
bit.

197
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,320
Wait, I want to see the burger.

198
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,780
Wait, Phoebe became a burger?

199
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,660
Yeah, you just take a, take one of the meat patties and then
you put it on the grill.

200
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,140
Here, watch this.

201
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,700
It's like popcorn.

202
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,060
Oh, wait, wait.

203
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,720
Oh,

204
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,860
hold on.

205
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,180
Try it.

206
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,140
All right.

207
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,320
Fry me up.

208
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:17,960
Baby?

209
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,380
Uh...

210
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:19,940
Oh, man.

211
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,560
The cheek version.

212
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:24,960
Yeah.

213
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:25,980
Yeah.

214
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,070
My butts.

215
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,030
My

216
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,330
butts.

217
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,350
My butts valley has a huge ass.

218
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,070
Let's go!

219
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:48,970
Let's go!

220
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,470
Let's go!

221
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,790
We found some bear spray.

222
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,230
Here, let me shower you, Phoebe.

223
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,250
Ooh.

224
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,910
Oh, I just...

225
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,730
Oh, can I have some bear spray as well, please?

226
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,090
Oh.

227
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,850
I think it was a one-time use.

228
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,210
Cool.

229
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,930
Okay, so the bears come for me then.

230
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,670
Thank you guys.

231
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,610
Are you okay?

232
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:09,430
Did it work?

233
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,730
Maybe the bear spray makes the bears like you more.

234
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:13,650
I don't know.

235
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,290
It doesn't feel like...

236
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,170
Do I smell nice?

237
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:16,950
Do I...

238
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,990
Hmm, smells like beer and cigarettes.

239
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,150
Where are you going?

240
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,250
Okay,

241
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,170

242
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,390
Okay, cool.

243
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,450
We're gonna watch some stuff.

244
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:32,950
What's happening?

245
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:33,630
What?

246
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,070
What?

247
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:34,710
What?

248
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,800
What's happening?

249
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,500
What's happening?

250
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,260
What's happening?

251
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,040
Oh, it's a bear!

252
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,400
The bear is here!

253
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:48,680
It's a bear!

254
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,420
It's a bear!

255
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,980
On that

256
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,660
note!

257
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Alright, how about whoever loses rock paper scissors has to
drive?

258
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,240
Okay!

259
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,520
Wait, how do you do it?

260
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,500
Oh, there it is.

261
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,640
Okay, I got it.

262
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,040
Press eggs and then you choose Okay.

263
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,600
Three, two, one.

264
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,660
Oh, we all did different things.

265
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,340
What does that mean?

266
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:20,980
We all chose different things.

267
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:21,780
Wait.

268
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,640
Whoa.

269
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,440
Whoa.

270
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,940
If there's that stuff like that for us now, Tiz, I'm the
paper.

271
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:28,660
Wait.

272
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,180
What does that mean?

273
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,920
Wait, we all did a different choice.

274
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,720
It's a three-way.

275
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,900
Yeah, I did scissors.

276
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,660
Well, I don't know what that means, guys.

277
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,720
So, um, okay.

278
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,700
That is a bit scary.

279
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,060
Yeah, I'm going to floor it.

280
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,820
I'm going to floor it.

281
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,660

Just lay down in the bed to get some nice rest, you know?

It's an addiction, and it's very serious.

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,000
It's very serious.

316
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,600
I didn't even have to go to rehab.

317
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,580
Guys, I don't think I should drive anymore.

318
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,680

Taking the six back.

332
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,600
Taking the six back.

333
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,100
Sorry.

Yeah, you can do this.

336
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,700
Would you like to?

337
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,260
You want to try?

338
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,800
You should try.

339
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,720
I think you should try.

340
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,280
Yeah.

341
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:52,780
Okay.

342
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,480
Who's having the best right here?

343
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,280
We believe in you.

344
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,760
Okay, I didn't understand how you switch gears or anything.

345
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,440
It's Q.

346
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,680
You hold it.

347
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,600
And then you go to number one.

348
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,720
Ah, so you go to number one.

349
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:07,880
Got it.

350
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,760
Am I sitting?

351
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,920
I should be sitting.

352
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,180
When the car is straining to keep up the speed, then you can
go to...

353
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,540
Hold it.

354
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,040

Oh!

358
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:30,860
Oh!

359
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:32,840
When

360
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,390

361
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,290

Guys, I told you I shouldn't have been driving!

368
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,140

I think I think that's for the best.

I think that should have probably been the case from the
beginning I'm just gonna have a beer and sit down We're

We might have to winch up.

00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,620
Winch might just have to drive up this thing.

479
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,280

Oh!

493
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,410
Maybe just floor it.

494
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,750
Oh, there's like a tiny little ram.

495
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,610
Wait, hold on, I'll get out and I'll direct you.

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:21,950
Whoa!

499
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,090
What is it?

500
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,590
What is it?

501
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,970
It might be a bear.

502
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,390
Um, do we have any more spray?

503
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,130
Run over.

504
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:29,510
Run over.

505
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:30,890
We floor it.

506
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,850
We floor it.

507
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:32,490
We floor it.

508
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:33,990
Oh.

509
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,600
That's a mood.

510
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,840
Wait, why did he jump?

511
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,040
You guys.

512
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,800
All right, now.

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,520
One.

514
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,660
Two.

515
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,100
Okay.

516
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,020
Now four.

517
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,880
I think you can't.

518
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:13,620
Four.

519
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,160
Four.

520
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,040
Now back to one, back to one, back to one.

521
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,340
Yeah!

522
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,460
Oh my god!

523
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,960
Oh my god!

524
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,160
I think we should drink one last cold one together,
everybody.

525
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,020
Come on.

526
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,880
Yeah, I think so.

527
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,380
Come on.

528
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,280
Yeah, grab one.

529
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,560
Whatever you have.

530
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,640
chug it.

531
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,700
Woo-hoo!

532
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,080
Chug it!

533
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,460
Kampai, everybody!

534
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,020
Kampai!

535
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,520
Yes!

536
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,060
Kampai!

537
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,580
Woo-hoo-hoo!

538
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:55,980

539
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,360
Kampai!

540
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,440
Kampai!

541
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,760
Thank you, everyone!

542
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,260
It is I, your Yurka-i princess, Victoria Roman.

543
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,780
I hope you guys enjoyed our RV adventures.

544
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,360
I will never touch a steering wheel again.

545
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:16,980
Ugh.

546
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,140
As for why I'm here by myself, well, this month is special.

547
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,540
For our Patreon channel, fan club artist this month is ARQ!

548
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,440
Who's ARQ?

549
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,120
What?

550
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,780
You don't know ARQ?

551
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,840
Impossible!

552
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,580
ARQ is an official artist for the IDW, publishers of Sonic's
comic series.

553
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,840
He's done all sorts of lovely covers for them, and so to
have him draw us is a dream come true.

554
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,940
He's drawn up a beautiful postcard of the three of us,
complete with a sausage roll, Obaka, very British indeed.

555
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,780
He also created three super cute grandma stickers of the
three of us.

556
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,800
Minto's classic.

557
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,580
It's pink.

558
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,220
Phoebe's never give up.

559
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,020
And my wife, Michael, put that down.

560
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,020
That's part of my private collection.

561
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,680
Ahem.

562
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,460
Anyway, depending on your tier, you get different merch
