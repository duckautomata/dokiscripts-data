1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,020
Oh,

2
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,280
hello, everybody.

3
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,980
Hi, hi, hi.

4
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,080
Oh, hi, hi.

5
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,800
Hi, hi, hi.

6
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,840
Hi, hi.

7
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,180
We return to the island, baby.

8
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,200
Hello, hello, again.

9
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,100
Hello, hello, hello.

10
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,680
Welcome to Jurassic Park.

11
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,640
Sorry, I didn't know that was going to happen.

12
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,850
I was about to start singing the song.

13
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,040
Is this game scary?

14
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,940
No, maybe.

15
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,740
Did you think original Jurassic Park was scary?

16
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,980
Well, actually, no.

17
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,700
The book is, like, an actual horror novel.

18
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,160
They've action-fied Jurassic Park, but the book?

19
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,980
The book is, like, actual horror.

20
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,240
Look at the little thing in the amber, and then you take the DNA.

21
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,420
Hey.

22
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:29,740
Whoa!

23
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,400
Yeah!

24
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,480
Clone, clone, clone!

25
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,620
Yeah!

26
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,960
I was a small child, so yes.

27
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,740
My niece told me to tell you your cue.

28
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,800
That's... it's actual size compared to a quarter.

29
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,320
No!

30
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,480
I... Also, there will be sound.

31
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,320
There will be.

32
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,840
I just gotta put the credits in.

33
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,780
I gotta... I got my quarters ready.

34
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,380
I got my quarters ready!

35
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,780
Um, what was I saying?

36
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,720
Uh...

37
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm gonna lower myself a little bit.

38
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,640
You know, I...

39
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,560
So, I'm... my...

40
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,640
So, here, bring my quarter down, too.

41
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,300
Okay, there we go.

42
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,660
Sorry, the game, like, pauses when I...

43
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,140
Okay, look at the raptors!

44
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,780
Um...

45
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,400
Yeah.

46
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,580
I was like, you know what?

47
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,640
I kinda wanna play...

48
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,640
Jurassic Park arcade game.

49
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,420
I don't know why.

50
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,540
I don't know why.

51
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,900
I just thought about it, you know?

52
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,100
And, um...

53
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,640
I got...

54
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,080
I'm being...

55
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,320
I'm...

56
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,520
Oh!

57
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,460
I'm playing with my...

58
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,300
With my trusty...

59
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,860
Uh...

60
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,720
Controller here.

61
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,320
So...

62
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,180
Um...

63
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,480
Yeah!

64
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,260
And...

65
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,380
Oh, I forgot to say...

66
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:39,840
Your niece!

67
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,440
Thank you.

68
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,040
I'm...

69
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,280
I'm...

70
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,760
I'm fluttering my eyelashes.

71
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:47,880
Yeah!

72
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,440
No light gun.

73
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,500
I actually...

74
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,660
In my research, learned that this game did not have a light gun.

75
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,200
This game...

76
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,800
I used a...

77
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,440
Uh...

78
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,700
Oh, gosh.

79
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,320
My brain.

80
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:01,720
Sorry.

81
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,740
I have a...

82
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,460
I have such a bad headache today.

83
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,300
Um...

84
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,180
A joystick!

85
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,220
Yeah, it was a joystick!

86
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,920
So, I was thinking...

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,340
And I was like, oh, I really wanna use, like, my 3D model.

88
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,560
For, like, some sort of arcade game in the future.

89
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,780
I was thinking maybe...

90
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,780
Um...

91
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,960
Maybe, like, Time Crisis.

92
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,160
Or something like that.

93
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:19,580
You know?

94
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:20,980
Hmm.

95
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,280
Hmm.

96
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
How was New York?

97
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,640
Oh, my gosh!

98
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,360
Thanks for asking!

99
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,420
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

100
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,300
I went to New York City.

101
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,860
For one day.

102
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,700
I went to New York City for one day.

103
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,760
I literally...

104
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,340
I woke up at 4 a.m.

105
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,860
I went to the airport.

106
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,300
Possessed a person.

107
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,320
Boarded the aircraft.

108
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,050
I...

109
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,420
Got there.

110
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,320
And why was I there?

111
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,240
You might ask.

112
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,440
I was there for the Metal Gear Solid Delta pop-up!

113
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:53,640
Yeah!

114
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,760
Yeah, I went and...

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,080
I met up with some friends there.

116
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,120
So, at first, I was like, I don't think I will go because I'm scared of New York.

117
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,120
And then all my friends were like, I'll be there.

118
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,120
I'll be there.

119
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,040
And I was like, okay, I'll go, I'll go.

120
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,980
And so, I went and...

121
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

122
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,240
It was so...

123
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,640
So, it was like a little pop-up where they were selling some merch.

124
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,080
And then also, you could play a demo of the game if you...

125
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,240
If you...

126
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,800
Got a ticket for that.

127
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
But also, they were like, letting anybody...

128
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,720
If there was space, they were letting anybody play the game.

129
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,940
So, you really didn't even need to get a ticket.

130
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,960
Thank you, guys, for all this.

131
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,780
Thank you.

132
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,060
Happy birthday.

133
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,160
Happy, happy birthday.

134
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,660
Did you show up and kept your wording, huh?

135
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,900
It was...

136
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,700
Did you get a chance?

137
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,420
Yeah, I did.

138
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,700
I...

139
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,860
They let me play walking in off the street.

140
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,440
No, si, si.

141
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,800
And so, I have already played it.

142
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,240
I had already played it at Tokyo Game Show last year.

143
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,680
But the demo went a little bit longer this time.

144
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,040
And before it went up to Sokolov.

145
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,620
But then this one was Virtuous Mission.

146
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,180
Which they did not tell me.

147
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:18,800
I actually...

148
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,540
I sped through everything.

149
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,300
I did...

150
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,460
Everybody else is like, Hmm, I'm going to see how shooting feels.

151
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,290
And how the guard's AI acts.

152
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,300
Hmm, I'm going to be all technical, me.

153
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,100
I was like, show me that ocelot.

154
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,420
I was like, I was like, let me get to ocelot.

155
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,380
Let me...

156
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,840
Let me get to ocelot.

157
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,420
And so, I zoomed everything.

158
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,720
I went pow, pow, pow to each guard.

159
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,200
I went boom, boom, boom.

160
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,340
Run, run, run.

161
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,220
I got to...

162
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,140
And the ocelot scene was the only cutscene.

163
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,360
I was...

164
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,220
Oh my gosh.

165
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:55,700
I was...

166
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,720
I was literally shaking.

167
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,180
My legs would not...

168
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,140
I could not control myself.

169
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,080
But I was by myself when I was doing the...

170
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,340
So I had to control my...

171
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:04,740
Oh my god.

172
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,580
Oh my god.

173
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,700
I'm getting excited again.

174
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,460
Okay.

175
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,440
I had...

176
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,180
I had tears in my eyes.

177
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,120
You guys don't understand.

178
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,720
I was...

179
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,200
Oh my god.

180
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,640
I pulled that.

181
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,060
I gotta stop thinking about it.

182
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,680
And...

183
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,280
And then I got through it.

184
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,420
And I was like, okay, well...

185
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
This was fun.

186
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,180
I'll just keep going.

187
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,820
And I get to...

188
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,900
I get through Snake...

189
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,840
I start Snake Eater.

190
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,840
And I'm like, la la la.

191
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,840
Okay, now I'll actually like...

192
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,240
Play the game.

193
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,200
And like, look around.

194
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,100
And do things.

195
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:45,760
And...

196
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,700
And some...

197
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,440
Someone came up to me and like...

198
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,340
Tapped me on the shoulder.

199
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,320
And they were like...

200
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,900
Okay, you're done.

201
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,740
And I was like...

202
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,440
Wait, what do you mean?

203
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:55,980
Well...

204
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,260
Huh?

205
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:57,980
They...

206
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,200
I...

207
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,860
At first I thought she said like...

208
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,500
Oh, sorry.

209
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,100
Like...

210
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,660
Something...

211
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,220
She said...

212
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,000
I couldn't understand.

213
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,560
I was like...

214
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,020
Oh, sorry.

215
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,300
She said something.

216
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,160
And I was like...

217
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,560
Oh.

218
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,120
No, I just got to this part.

219
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,840
And she was like...

220
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,560
No, no.

221
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,420
We have to kick you out.

222
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,320
It's only...

223
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,140
Well, she didn't say that.

224
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:16,620
But...

225
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,120
She was like...

226
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,860
It's only...

227
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,700
It's only Virtuous Mission.

228
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,840
You can play up to.

229
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,140
You can't...

230
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,060
You can't start snake-eating him.

231
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,620
I was like...

232
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:29,960
Oh...

233
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,770
So...

234
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:36,890
Yeah...

235
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,830
Join us here today.

236
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,570
The world record holder of Delta Demo Masala.

237
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,170
Percent.

238
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:42,950
Yeah...

239
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,110
Yeah...

240
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,890
So I got kicked out...

241
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,030
A little early...

242
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,610
I was like...

243
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,250
Oh man...

244
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,090
I just want to like...

245
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,130
Now actually...

246
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,130
Do the controls and stuff.

247
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:55,630
Hmm.

248
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,650
But...

249
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,190
It was good.

250
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,170
It was good, good.

251
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,030
Yes, yes.

252
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,010
Virtual Mission.

253
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,070
But the pop-up itself was like...

254
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,370
Oh my gosh.

255
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:09,870
Like I said...

256
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,710
It was so beautiful.

257
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,290
The venue was so...

258
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:14,990
Oh my gosh.

259
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,270
They did such an incredible job with the decorating and everything.

260
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:19,370
And...

261
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,470
Um...

262
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,290
My friend Maddie...

263
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,010
Oh, that's Raspberry.

264
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:23,810
She was there.

265
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,990
I got to hang out with her.

266
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,310
And I really love her.

267
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,270
So I'm really happy.

268
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,030
And...

269
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:44,970
Um...

270
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,250
Me and my friend...

271
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,770
We were being really obnoxious.

272
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,550
We were like...

273
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,990
Oh my god.

274
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:49,910
It's stag.

275
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:50,490
Oh my god.

276
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,310
And I brought so many little toys and trinkets...

277
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,090
Because I wanted to get a million pictures.

278
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,390
Which I did.

279
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,410
Uh...

280
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,530
Yeah, my Oshikots.

281
00:11:59,690 --> 00:11:59,850
Yeah.

282
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,290
And I was like...

283
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:01,590
Stag!

284
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,190
On the wall.

285
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,010
And...

286
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,730
I look to my...

287
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,170
I look...

288
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,010
I look over and...

289
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,770
Uh...

290
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,070
Uh...

291
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:12,670
There was...

292
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,790
Sea Dog Connor.

293
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,210
Watching my friend and I.

294
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,490
And I was like...

295
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:19,890
Oh no.

296
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:22,910
And...

297
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,150
And I was like...

298
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,990
Oh...

299
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,670
Hello.

300
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,050
I'm...

301
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,030
I'm Mint Phantom.

302
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,650
And he was like...

303
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,690
Yeah, I know.

304
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,290
Oops.

305
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,930
Whoopsie.

306
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,270
Oops.

307
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,390
I made a fool of...

308
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,350
In front of that guy.

309
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,530
And also in front of the creative director of Delta.

310
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,170
So...

311
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:53,810
Yeah.

312
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,410
I hope they...

313
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,730
I hope the director felt my passion.

314
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,130
But he gave me a free t-shirt.

315
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,630
That was really nice of him.

316
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,830
So...

317
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,210
Yeah.

318
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,860
He's like one of the...

319
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,360
He was a guy that like...

320
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,920
Helped make the pop-up happen.

321
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:16,880
So...

322
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,720
Yeah, I got a free shirt.

323
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,380
Yippee.

324
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,800
It was really, really nice.

325
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,180
And...

326
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,920
Oh my gosh.

327
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,600
I don't know if you guys saw the pictures from the pop-up.

328
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,660
But I definitely posted on...

329
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,440
And don't worry.

330
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,300
We're gonna get to the game.

331
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,080
Like really soon.

332
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,440
Sorry.

333
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:30,880
I'm yapping.

334
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,800
I posted pictures.

335
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,440
And you can see the room has like...

336
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,280
The projection on all the walls.

337
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,600
And then also...

338
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,640
There's the flowers.

339
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,240
There's the flowers in the room.

340
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,620
I learned that those flowers...

341
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,240
Those...

342
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,960
Those were custom made.

343
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,100
They...

344
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,600
They went out of their way to get the exact flower made for the event.

345
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,220
So that it wouldn't just be like white flowers.

346
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,380
Like it was...

347
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
It was...

348
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:00,940
The actual...

349
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,660
I was like...

350
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,820
Holy moly.

351
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,860
Like that's...

352
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,920
That's some incredible...

353
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,400
Oh my gosh.

354
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,580
I'm still so...

355
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,500
I'm not over it.

356
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,680
I'm so not over it.

357
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,220
Yeah.

358
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,300
The detail was just really, really impressive to me.

359
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,660
So...

360
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,440
Bill, thank you so much for the...

361
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,180
Thank you.

362
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,800
Thank you.

363
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,640
Got caught being herself again.

364
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,260
My friend, she went in first for the playthrough.

365
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,760
And I saw her afterwards.

366
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,140
And that's when she told me.

367
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,000
She was like...

368
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,300
You...

369
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,320
You can get to the ocelot part.

370
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,440
And I was like...

371
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,540
So that's what motivated me.

372
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,260
Because I thought it was going to be the same as like with TGS.

373
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:43,860
But no.

374
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,200
It was apparently the whole...

375
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,480
The whole entire game.

376
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,900
The whole game at my fingertips.

377
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,340
And I couldn't play it.

378
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,800
And it's killing me.

379
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,360
It's killing me.

380
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,760
Mintosaurus Rex.

381
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,820
Sounds like MGS Nerd Heaven.

382
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,140
It really was.

383
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,880
And it was so great.

384
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,380
Nier fans.

385
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,160
MGS fans.

386
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,220
Crying over a field of white flowers.

387
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,500
Thank you for the vibe gifted.

388
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,660
It was really nice.

389
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,960
Everybody was like wearing Metal Gear shirts.

390
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,100
And...

391
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,280
And...

392
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,680
There were some cosplayers.

393
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,940
There were official cosplayers.

394
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,340
Like I saw a cosplayer.

395
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,600
Paramedic even.

396
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,140
I was like...

397
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,800
Oh my gosh.

398
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,380
I saw a cosplayer of the boss.

399
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,620
There was like a snake cosplayer.

400
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,480
He looked really good.

401
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,660
I did not get to meet him.

402
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,200
Thank God.

403
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,100
Because...

404
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,740
I would be...

405
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,060
I would be acting like a fool.

406
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,660
And...

407
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,160
Um...

408
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh my gosh.

409
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,380
And then afterwards...

410
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:43,840
Uh...

411
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,700
I went to Federal Hall.

412
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,100
I got to do a little bit of Oshikats.

413
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,660
MGS2 Oshikats.

414
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,860
And I went to Federal Hall.

415
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,520
And it was so smelly.

416
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:54,900
Gosh.

417
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,400
New York is such a stinky city.

418
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,640
Um...

419
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,000
I woke up this morning.

420
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,900
And I was like...

421
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,680
Oh my throat.

422
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,700
Did I get sick?

423
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,060
No.

424
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,820
I think it was just the air there.

425
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
It was gross.

426
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,140
Those weren't cosplayers.

427
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,140
They were New Yorkers.

428
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
What are you talking about?

429
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,540
Your love for MGS has caused me to buy the Master Collection via two copies of four.

430
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,280
Oh my gosh.

431
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:20,860
Yeah.

432
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,160
It was really stinky.

433
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,320
But...

434
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,200
I was like...

435
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,900
Oh my gosh.

436
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,020
That's where Solidus died.

437
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,640
And oh my gosh.

438
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,020
That's where...

439
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,420
That's where Snake was standing.

440
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,540
Oh, this is where all the people walked in Slough Motion.

441
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,360
My president died up there.

442
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,700
Oh my...

443
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,280
And Raiden.

444
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,440
And that's where Raiden threw his dog tag away.

445
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,140
I was...

446
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,720
I was...

447
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,700
I was just being a silly goofball.

448
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,900
I also got to see the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building.

449
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,720
And I was like...

450
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,020
I was like...

451
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,680
I pointed to the Chrysler Building and I was like, that's what King Kong climbed.

452
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,020
And I was just waiting for some nerd to come up and be like, um...

453
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,340
Actually, it was the Empire State Building.

454
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,840
And I could prove it.

455
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,820
And then King Kong all night.

456
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,320
Woo!

457
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,720
So, it was a lot of fun.

458
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,000
And...

459
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,160
And then I went home.

460
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,560
And I just was there for one day.

461
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,620
And that was it.

462
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,880
I went just for that.

463
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,880
And then I...

464
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,700
Then I was...

465
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,980
Then I'm back and I'm here.

466
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:37,920
Yeah.

467
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,740
So...

468
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,620
Jane, happy birthday!

469
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,800
Sorry, I missed it.

470
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,600
Even though it was yesterday.

471
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,200
I'm sorry.

472
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,320
I was in New York.

473
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,800
Hot dog!

474
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,820
Hot dog.

475
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah, I've never done that before.

476
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,280
Where it was like a...

477
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,940
A day trip kind of thing.

478
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,820
Like where I get in and then leave.

479
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,160
I've never done anything like that before.

480
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,480
It was...

481
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,060
It was very...

482
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,620
I think that's why I have a headache today.

483
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
In fact, I might actually go get some medicine.

484
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,420
If you guys will let me.

485
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,160
Minto cosplaying as Rose.

486
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,980
Gonna cry about empty rooms.

487
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,060
I wanted to be like...

488
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,440
I wanted to be that...

489
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,080
The tourist.

490
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,280
That's just like...

491
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,160
Um, excuse me.

492
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:24,980
Which...

493
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,560
Which one of those buildings did King Kong climb?

494
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,940
And then some...

495
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,460
Some cute lady goes...

496
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,200
Oh, it's the Chrysler building, I think.

497
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,580
And then I wanted to watch it happen.

498
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,100
I wanted to watch the meet cute.

499
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,040
I wanted to watch them be like...

500
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,440
Um, no, actually.

501
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,160
It was epic.

502
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,080
And then I'm just sitting there like...

503
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,900
It's happening.

504
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,140
It's happening.

505
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,980
It's happening right now in my head.

506
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:47,800
Whew.

507
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,300
Okay.

508
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,420
I'm gonna go get some...

509
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,860
A headache medicine.

510
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,080
Um, do you guys wanna listen to the song?

511
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,260
Actually, it's really annoying.

512
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,220
Okay, hold on.

513
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,580
Let me put on some music at least.

514
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,300
Wah!

515
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,820
Raptor attack.

516
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,060
Raptor attack.

517
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,500
Raptor attack.

518
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,260
Uh, uh, uh.

519
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,040
Na-na-na.

520
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,400
Na-na-na-na.

521
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,040
Na-na.

522
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,380
Sorry, guys.

523
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,360
I'm gonna be like...

524
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:11,680
One second.

525
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,870
The special April 30th tour.

526
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,250
It was so cool, too.

527
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,250
Though, walking around...

528
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,310
I felt like I was in Metal Gear.

529
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,870
And then I saw the bridge.

530
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:23,990
And I was like...

531
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,970
Hudson River.

532
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:26,890
Sorry.

533
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:27,810
Okay, sorry.

534
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,190
Okay.

535
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,010
Okay.

536
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:31,370
Okay.

537
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,850
Give me one second to go get some medicine.

538
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:33,330
Okay.

539
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,530
Uh, you can keep watching.

540
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:36,530
BRB!

541
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:16,980
Ugh.

542
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,540
Oh my gosh.

543
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:17,860
I'm back.

544
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,240
Sorry.

545
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:18,800
Ugh.

546
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,440
It's...

547
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,100
Ugh.

548
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:21,980
Ugh.

549
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,520
Sorry.

550
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:22,960
Ugh.

551
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,960
Migraines suck.

552
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,100
I even just talked about how I don't get migraines very much anymore.

553
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,420
Damn!

554
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:27,900
It's it.

555
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,080
Thank you so much for the 50-50.

556
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,020
Thank you.

557
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,380
Thank you.

558
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:30,760
Thank you.

559
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,200
Ah.

560
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:43,960
Okay.

561
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,320
Ooh.

562
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:47,760
Ooh.

563
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,300
Rev up that Botox.

564
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,780
I did jinx it, huh?

565
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,880
I did.

566
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,260
I did.

567
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,680
Anyways.

568
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,480
I saw someone say...

569
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,820
Natsukashii BGM, right?

570
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:01,680
Whoa.

571
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,220
Zach, thank you so much for the 50.

572
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,380
Thank you, guys.

573
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:04,800
Thank you.

574
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,200
Thank you.

575
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,300
Holy cow.

576
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:06,760
Why?

577
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,780
Why so many you gifted today?

578
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,560
All right.

579
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
I have to warn you guys.

580
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,900
I didn't adjust the volume yet.

581
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,060
So I don't know if it's too loud or not.

582
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,040
Seeing you gush about Metal Gear has made me decide to replay the Pagetor.

583
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,420
Whoa.

584
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,380
Nice.

585
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,500
Whoa.

586
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,020
Yeah.

587
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:26,840
Oh, my God.

588
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:27,620
Really?

589
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,060
Yesterday just reignited everything that I love about the series.

590
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,680
For real.

591
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,080
Very loving this retro Mito video game arc.

592
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:35,460
I know.

593
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,720
Recently, I've just been only doing retro games, huh?

594
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,340
Yeah.

595
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,580
And here we have the Ghost VTuber at its natural environment.

596
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,860
A Konami promotional event for Metal Gear game.

597
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,380
Thank you for the super test.

598
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,160
Thank you.

599
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,840
King Kong Riot.

600
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:50,640
That's me.

601
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,820
I'm causing the riot.

602
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,460
Look at the paused image.

603
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,080
Sorry.

604
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,260
I'm a little hyper today because I'm so excited about yesterday still.

605
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,560
But also, today will be a lot of fun.

606
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,220
And this game...

607
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,180
Oh, sorry.

608
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,520
Hold on.

609
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,780
Oh, hold on.

610
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,460
If I get too excited, it hurts so bad.

611
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,080
But I can't stop getting excited.

612
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,820
I think I...

613
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,680
Oh, okay.

614
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,240
Okay.

615
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,260
The title's music for this is really, really obnoxious.

616
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,260
But we're gonna make it.

617
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,140
I believe.

618
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,240
Even if I need a million quarters, we'll make it.

619
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,900
I believe.

620
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,120
I'm gonna start with five quarters.

621
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,900
And then we'll go from there.

622
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,940
But I'm confident.

623
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,780
If I have to get more quarters, I will.

624
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:44,700
Okay?

625
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,540
If I have to get more quarters, I'll just go get more quarters.

626
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:50,900
Alright.

627
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,920
Oh.

628
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,960
Did my...

629
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,900
Did my...

630
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,020
Did my...

631
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,860
Thing disconnect?

632
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,320
There it is.

633
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,940
Good luck.

634
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,220
Good luck.

635
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,960
Good luck.

636
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,820
Good luck.

637
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,360
Good luck.

638
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,640
Maybe we'll start with three.

639
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,480
This is so annoying.

640
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,740
It is like the dandaran.

641
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,160
Okay.

642
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,360
Ikimasu!

643
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,740
And then...

644
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,400
Jurassic Park!

645
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,180
Sorry, player two.

646
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,740
You don't get to play.

647
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
Area one, baby.

648
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,540
Area one.

649
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,620
When's the T-Rex come out?

650
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,220
Ah!

651
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,900
Right there!

652
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,100
Oh, he's shaking!

653
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,500
Ah!

654
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,580
Shoot the head!

655
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,640
I'm shooting.

656
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,320
Oh my gosh.

657
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
I'm actually so stable.

658
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:57,820
Oh.

659
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,180
Oh.

660
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:58,460
Oh.

661
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,020
Only...

662
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,540
Oh my god.

663
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,200
Oh my god.

664
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,120
Oh my god.

665
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,100
Yeah, yeah.

666
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,640
Oh gosh.

667
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,580
She's getting real close to me.

668
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,220
Oh gosh.

669
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,260
She's getting real close to me.

670
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,560
One dino...

671
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:12,860
Nevermind.

672
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,180
I was gonna say one dino down.

673
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,520
Is this the head?

674
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,640
I'm already at half health.

675
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,560
Yeah!

676
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:26,920
Uh-oh.

677
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,540
Oh, shoot.

678
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,420
Uh, shoot.

679
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:28,840
Oh, shoot.

680
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,220
Shoot.

681
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,660
I got some health.

682
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,360
There's-there's-there's raptors everywhere and rocks!

683
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,300
Oh my god!

684
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,680
I can't see anything!

685
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:42,740
Why?

686
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,600
Why is the music like... What's

687
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,450
the sensitivity?

688
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,050
Crazy.

689
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,170
It automatically, like, goes... Oh gosh!

690
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,550
Goes back to the middle like that, you see?

691
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,170
So it's a little tough.

692
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:07,450
Oh!

693
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,330
Out of the way!

694
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,530
Out of the... Guys.

695
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,990
Not the Triceratops!

696
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,170
I think we made them angry!

697
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,230
I think we made them mad!

698
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:17,570
Oh my god.

699
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,130
Oh my god.

700
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:18,730
Where?

701
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,530
This is insane.

702
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,670
Oh gosh!

703
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:22,930
Oh god!

704
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,530
Oh no!

705
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,150
I'm gonna die!

706
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:25,790
Oh my god!

707
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,430
I'm gonna die!

708
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:26,930
No, no, no!

709
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:27,590
Please, no!

710
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,070
Please, no!

711
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,470
Please, no!

712
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:28,810
Please, no!

713
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,230
Please, no!

714
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:29,830
Oh my gosh!

715
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,530
I'm in danger!

716
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,370
Uh-oh.

717
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,170
I'm in danger.

718
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,060
Guys... I have to go ask for another corridor.

719
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,220
I have to go ask for another corridor.

720
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:44,960
Oh my god!

721
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,380
Wait!

722
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,660
I forgot something.

Wait!

822
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,420
So I asked my mom for more money and she said you gotta do chores.

823
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,200
For more money.

824
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,300
So I can't... I can't... I can't do anything until I wash the dishes.

825
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,020
Because my mom will give you a quarter.

826
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,260
No!

827
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,780
Okay, okay.

828
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,560
Alright.

829
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,380
This is easy peasy.

830
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,600
Oh.

831
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,300
I'm washing.

832
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,860
Go away.

833
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,320
It's clean enough.

834
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,180
Okay.

835
00:26:59,460 --> 00:26:59,760
Next.

836
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,320
The Covenant Corner!

837
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,740
Thanks, Mom!

838
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,760
Oh.

839
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,420
Uh.

840
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,600
Wait, where am I?

841
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,280
Oh.

842
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:39,720
The

843
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:45,940
Covenant Corner.

844
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:46,480
Okay.

845
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,200
Are you guys ready?

846
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,020
Let's keep going.

847
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,540
Oh.

848
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,520
Oh shoot.

849
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,160
How do I shoot?

850
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,480
Shoot.

851
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,040
I didn't miss a spot.

852
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,480
Ah!

853
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,420
I thought that we were done here!

854
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,360
Oh my gosh.

855
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,040
Oh my gosh.

856
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,940
Oh my gosh.

857
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,400
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

858
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,880
Oh god, no!

859
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,760
Oh my god.

860
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,600
I don't want to shoot the triceratops though.

861
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,080
They're so cute.

862
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,000
Why did they attack me?

863
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,280
Aren't you guys so...

864
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,640
I'll give you... I'll give you a start...

865
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,560
One of those leaves.

866
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,820
That's really popular.

867
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,600
Oh, did we make it?

868
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,280
Oh, there's some health.

869
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,020
Let's go.

870
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,340
Oh, maybe I should grab...

871
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:23,600
Oh!

872
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:23,980
Oh!

873
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:24,340
Oh!

874
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:24,720
Ah!

875
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,240
Ah!

876
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,140
Oh my gosh.

877
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,380
Wait.

878
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,380
Since when?

879
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,820
Guys, I'm in danger.

880
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,220
Guys, I'm in danger.

881
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,800
Guys!

882
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,720
Guys!

883
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,100
Guys, I have to go ask for another quarter.

884
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,200
Guys, I have to go ask for another quarter.

885
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,250
Guys,

886
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,060
so I asked my mom for another quarter and she said, get a job.

887
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,900
So, today, I sell lemonade.

888
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,000
Lemonade here!

889
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,440
Lemonade!

890
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,740
25 cents, one quarter.

891
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,580
Get your lemonade!

892
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,400
Lemonade!

893
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:12,960
Lemonade!

894
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:13,920
Get your lemonade!

895
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,380
Get your lemonade!

896
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,080
Just 25 cents for your lemonade!

897
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,200
La-da-da-da!

898
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:29,940
Oh!

899
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,340
Hello, sir!

900
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:37,360
Would you like a nice, cold, tall glass of lemonade?

901
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:38,700
Oh!

902
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,420
Yeah.

903
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,720
I'll take it.

904
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:45,900
Okay.

905
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,400
Oh, hold on.

906
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,060
Yes sir, that'll be 25 cents.

907
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,530
There you are.

908
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,830
Thanks a lot.

909
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,930
It looks delicious.

910
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:25,290
Okay.

911
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,050
Okay guys, we got our quarter.

912
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,110
Let's go back to the arcade.

913
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,160
I got another quarter.

914
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,000
Okay!

915
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,320
We can do this!

916
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,120
I believe!

917
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:55,930
I forgot the quarter.

918
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,230
No, it's right here on my head.

919
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,030
Don't worry.

920
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:58,930
Don't worry about it.

921
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:00,650
Oh my gosh.

922
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,710
Oh my gosh, this part is... How am I supposed to avoid this?

923
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,350
Oh my god.

924
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,610
Wait, I'm doing it.

925
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,070
I'm killing him.

926
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:06,550
I'm killing him.

927
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,770
Wait, how am I supposed to do this?

928
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,970
Oh my god, it's too difficult.

929
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,700
The island of lemonade.

930
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,340
So I only sold...

931
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,180
Oh please!

932
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,920
Please!

933
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,040
Guys...

934
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,060
We have to go ask for another quarter.

935
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,700
I

936
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,600
think we have to go ask for another quarter.

937
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,000
Your mom is being kind of stingy.

938
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,220
Oh no, no, don't worry about it.

939
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,000
Okay.

940
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,000
Okay, let's go ask for another quarter.

941
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,080
Okay.

942
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,800
Ah, yes.

943
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,580
New York City.

944
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,980
I just... I just... I was just here, Times Square.

945
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,340
Actually, I didn't go to Times Square.

946
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,740
Well, but you know what you learn from Times Square?

947
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,260
It's that...

948
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,480
It's that anybody can be scammed at Times Square.

949
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,600
All you have to do is have the right act.

950
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,200
And me, I know exactly what to do.

951
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,500
I'm Elmo.

952
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,820
And today, I'm going to sing on the street for cash money.

953
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:11,120
If you see me, if you look me in the eyes, you have to give me a quarter.

954
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,260
It's the rules.

955
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,660
It's the rules.

956
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,940
It's the rules of... of Times Square.

957
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,200
Okay.

958
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,140
I will sing... I will sing now.

959
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,260
Is it going to play?

960
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:17,700
I will sing now.

961
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,960
Here's a room.

962
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,680
Dram!

963
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,740

I

1152
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:13,210
think we're all good.

1153
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,570
Oh my goodness gracious.

1154
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:19,850
Oh wait, I forgot to come back.

1155
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,790
Oh my gosh, I'm all hot and sweaty now.

1156
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,810
Okay, let's beat this game, right?

1157
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,690
Yeah, thanks for the quarter, Mom, and everybody else.

1158
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,050
Thanks for the quarters.

1159
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,470
I think I got sunburned even, look at me.

1160
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:44,230
Oh my gosh, I didn't expect that I would be mowing the lawn today.

1161
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,470
Alright, let's keep going.

1162
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,080
Okay, I gotta get the trees though, no?

1163
00:43:59,260 --> 00:43:59,700
Oh, no?

1164
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,340
We're good?

1165
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,320
What is this?

1166
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,560
Oh, we're blowing up cars now.

1167
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,500
These could be a means of escape, no?

1168
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,000
Wait, why is it caution?

1169
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,160
Oh my gosh.

1170
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,360
These guys, again.

1171
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,760
Please, please wear some health.

1172
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,780
Please wear some health, no!

1173
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,540
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1174
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,540
This is so hard.

1175
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,080
Why is this game so hard?

1176
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,500
Guys...

1177
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,860
Um... I... I'm... Okay, hold on.

1178
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,140
Let me... Hold on, one moment.

1179
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,160
I'm

1180
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:39,600
gonna look under the, uh... The machine to see if, um...

1181
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,040
If anybody... If anybody's dropped any quarters, you know?

1182
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,920
Oh, no!

1183
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,520
Found one!

1184
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,720
I found one under the machine!

1185
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,280
How lucky is that?

1186
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:54,640
Yippee!

1187
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,160
Okay, we continue.

1188
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,480
Oh my gosh, please, please, please!

1189
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,020
Ow!

1190
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:03,860
God!

1191
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:04,860
This game!

1192
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:13,260
I'm getting the... I'm getting the... The vines and the... The cautions and everything!

1193
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,340
Oh my gosh!

1194
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,800
We're only on area two?

1195
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,420
Oh shoot.

1196
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,620
Oh no!

1197
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,540
Oh no!

1198
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:28,410
Ouch!

1199
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:29,170
Ouch, ouch.

1200
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:30,450
Please go away!

1201
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,150
Guys,

1202
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,700
I'm totally out of my bit, actually.

1203
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,520
I thought we were on area two.

1204
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,580
Um... I miscalculated... A little bit.

1205
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,920
Oh my god, there's feet!

1206
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,460
Ah!

1207
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,100
Oh!

1208
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:54,560
Oh!

1209
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,360
Please move!

1210
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,360
My bit is over.

1211
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,380
We can go back to Elmo.

1212
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,580
Oh my gosh, I'm shooting, but it's not doing anything!

1213
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,960
I'm in danger!

1214
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,220
Now there's... Dinosaur fish?

1215
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,080
Dolphins?

1216
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,100
Oh, we're going in.

1217
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,060
No, we're not.

1218
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:26,880
Yes, we are.

1219
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,280
Ah!

1220
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,920
Please, please, please!

1221
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:30,720
Continue!

1222
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,320
Dino dolphins, even.

1223
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,420
There's everything you could imagine in this... Oh my gosh.

1224
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,060
Please, please, please, please.

1225
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,460
Please, please.

1226
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,140
This game is so hard.

1227
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,200
I wish it were a light gun, honestly.

1228
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,700
It would be so much easier.

1229
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,660
Oh, I got him, I got him.

1230
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,040
Ah!

1231
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,500
Oh, I got his ass.

1232
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,320
Health!

1233
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:54,700
Health!

1234
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,060
Health!

1235
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,340
Shoots everywhere but the health!

1236
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,320
Okay, nice.

1237
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,340
Yeah, I'm using a controller for this, guys.

1238
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:06,960
There's nothing else.

1239
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,300
What else could you use?

1240
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,280
I guess a joystick, but...

1241
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,040
I don't have one.

1242
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,100
Ow!

1243
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:12,600
Ow!

1244
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,040
Ow!

1245
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,440
The birds.

1246
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,660
The birds, the birds, the birds.

1247
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,840
Pterodactyls, pterodactyls everywhere!

1248
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:19,880
Pterodactyls!

1249
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,200
Ow!

1250
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,180
Oh my gosh!

1251
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,520
This game is brutal.

1252
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,660
I mean, it's definitely the sensitivity too, but...

1253
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:29,880
Um...

1254
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,140
Hello?

1255
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,820
Please, destroy.

1256
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,360
Thank you.

1257
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,600
DDR pad?

1258
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,080
That would be kinda sick, not gonna lie.

1259
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:38,480
Okay.

1260
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:39,540
Ew!

1261
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,940
Oh, he sneezed on me!

1262
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,260
Oh, how cute!

1263
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,280
It's a corner.

1264
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:45,920
Yeah.

1265
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:46,800
Again?

1266
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,940
Oh my gosh.

1267
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:51,240
Okay.

1268
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,160
Shoot his head!

1269
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,400
Jump up on the hydra's back!

1270
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:55,720
Oh!

1271
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:56,980
Please!

1272
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:57,460
Please!

1273
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,300
Oh, please!

1274
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,440
Thank you for the super chat!

1275
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,140
I'm gonna do like five quarters.

1276
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,480
Oh, shoot.

1277
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:04,920
Hold on.

1278
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:05,260
Wait.

1279
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,480
I was scratching my face.

1280
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,680
Oh my god.

1281
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,060
How am I supposed to get him to duck back?

1282
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,120
Oh my god!

1283
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:14,940
Oh my god!

1284
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,160
Oh my god!

1285
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:16,840
Oh my god!

1286
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,980
The way he freaks out!

1287
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:20,920
Oh, please.

1288
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,900
Please aim.

1289
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,920
Please, Watashi!

1290
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:25,900
Aim!

1291
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,420
Aim, Watashi!

1292
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,580
I'm still shooting, even when he like, comes up like that.

1293
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,780
When he comes up like this, but it doesn't do anything.

1294
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,400
Are those healths in the...

1295
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,080
In the signs up here or something?

1296
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,900
Wait, he's almost dead!

1297
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:46,860
He's almost down!

1298
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,000
Yay!

1299
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:55,810
I don't think you're supposed to be able to.

1300
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:57,590
We're over to Area 3!

1301
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,830
That's so much faster when you like, aren't...

1302
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,390
Having to beg for quarters from people.

1303
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:03,190
Oh!

1304
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,330
I can't...

1305
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,270
Oh!

1306
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,290
Somehow we're alive!

1307
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:13,030
I'm alive!

1308
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:18,570
Raptors, raptors, raptors, raptors!

1309
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,500
They're so funny.

1310
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:25,420
Actually...

1311
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,640
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

1312
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,100
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

1313
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,200
I can't see anything!

1314
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:29,640
Ah!

1315
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,540
Everything is just...

1316
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:31,760
Oh god!

1317
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,760
The way they pop up is so funny.

1318
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,430
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

1319
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,450
I don't remember this part of the movie.

1320
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:55,990
You guys...

1321
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,330
The lava levels?

1322
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:59,830
Oh my gosh, oh my god!

1323
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,170
Go away!

1324
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:01,910
Oh, there was help!

1325
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,810
Yes, yes.

1326
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:07,890
Are we still in the car?

1327
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:08,330
Yeah!

1328
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,930
We are somehow still in the car!

1329
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:13,010
Explode!

1330
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:14,850
Oh my gosh, they're still angry at me?

1331
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:15,550
You guys hold a...

1332
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:15,890
Wait!

1333
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,770
Is this the end of the world, or...

1334
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:18,490
Am I crazy?

1335
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:22,670
I don't think there was a volcano in Jurassic Park.

1336
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,010
This game is so anxiety-inducing.

1337
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,050
Oh, oh!

1338
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:33,970
I'm supposed to shoot these.

1339
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:34,630
Please, please!

1340
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:35,170
Ah!

1341
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:36,390
I can't even see them!

1342
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,550
There's so much to keep track of!

1343
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:42,590
Oh my god!

1344
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:43,850
The end of the world is here!

1345
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:45,310
Oh my god!

1346
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,730
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

1347
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,790
I'm the worst driver ever.

1348
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:50,110
Just driving...

1349
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,730
Oh, he's showing ass!

1350
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:52,610
No!

1351
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,610
I'm missing everything.

1352
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:59,610
You miss 100% of the shots that you do and don't take.

1353
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:00,510
Apparently.

1354
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:03,570
Oh my gosh!

1355
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,450
I can't see anything!

1356
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:09,790
Indiana Jones!

1357
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,020
Okay, we got two more credits before we have to go back to Elmo.

1358
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,580
Everybody tell Elmo what you wanna sing!

1359
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,220
What song you wanna hear!

1360
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,160
Tell Elmo!

1361
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,820
Oh my gosh!

1362
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:28,560
Oh my god!

1363
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,080
Oh!

1364
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:29,140
Whoa!

1365
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,320
The most dangerous dinosaur rock.

1366
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,160
Oh!

1367
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,440
Oh, it's...

1368
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,040
I was thinking we were playing...

1369
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,340
Bowling.

1370
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,180
That guy just came up in the middle of the screen.

1371
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,360
Oh my gosh!

1372
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:48,760
Die!

1373
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:49,280
Die!

1374
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:49,840
Die!

1375
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:50,160
Die!

1376
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:50,680
Die!

1377
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,120
Die!

1378
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:51,560
Die!

1379
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:51,960
Die!

1380
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,160
Die!

1381
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:52,640
Die!

1382
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:52,700
Die!

1383
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:55,480
Die!

1384
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,180
Die!

1385
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:02,510
Die!

1386
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,210
Give him one raw... Oh, gosh.

1387
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:04,970
Oh my gosh.

1388
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:05,970
Just dodge!

1389
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,570
Just dodge, please!

1390
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:15,710
Sometimes I don't even move my... thing, because I'm like, it's not even... It's not worth it.

1391
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:17,410
Oh, there's so much health!

1392
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:18,210
I missed it!

1393
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,830
Oh, this game is insane.

1394
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:21,190
What the hell?

1395
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:22,350
Oh my god!

1396
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:24,510
Please!

1397
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,530
We tank those!

1398
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,110
This is the last area!

1399
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:35,050
Oh my gosh, we're inside.

1400
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:36,710
Open up.

1401
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:41,450
Oh, ouch.

1402
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:43,150
1HP to dream?

1403
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,940
They're like, hi!

1404
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,040
The way they come out is so cute.

1405
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,100
Oh, they're even upside down!

1406
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,360
Clever girl.

1407
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,440
No dream.

1408
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,120
Now it's just a dream.

1409
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,540
Oh my god!

1410
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,880
Everybody's inside!

1411
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,640
Oh my god!

1412
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,760
Literally, everybody's here!

1413
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,680
The smash of Jurassic...

1414
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,140
I can't...

1415
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,760
Guys, where is this?

1416
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,120
Close, close, close, close, close.

1417
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:18,900
I got a couple.

1418
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,400
Oh my god.

1419
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,360
Are you guys feeling the pressure?

1420
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,210
What a thrill.

1421
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:10,610
What a thrill...

1422
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:14,030
With darkness and silence through the night.

1423
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:20,250
What a thrill...

1424
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:20,470
What a thrill...

1425
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:26,250
I'm searching and I'll melt into you...

1426
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:34,330
What I fear in my heart, but you're so supreme.

1427
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:45,130
I give my life, not for water, but for you.

1428
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:59,050
Elmo, in my time, there'll be no one else.

1429
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:06,710
Crime, it's the way I find to you.

1430
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:13,750
Elmo, I'm still in a dream.

1431
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:16,370
Elmo.

1432
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:24,670
Someday, you go through the rain.

1433
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:30,350
Someday, you feed on a tree frog.

1434
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:35,190
This ordeal, the trial to survive.

1435
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:40,730
For the day, we see new light.

1436
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:50,070
I give my life, not for honor, but for you.

1437
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:02,340
In my time, there'll be no one else.

1438
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:12,000
It's the way I fly to you.

1439
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:19,800
I'm still in a dream.

1440
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,740
Elmo.

1441
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,380
I'm still in a dream.

1442
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,840
Elmo.

1443
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,860
All

1444
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:00,600
right!

1445
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,200
We got another quarter!

1446
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,200
Let's keep going!

1447
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,760
I'm scared.

1448
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,100
I'm scared.

1449
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,340
Plus two.

1450
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:14,420
Oh,

1451
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,180
please, please, please, please, please!

1452
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,240
I wanna live!

1453
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:30,900
I wanna live!

1454
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,480
Wait, are we done?

1455
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,760
No.

1456
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,920
Oh my gosh, this is just like Metal Gear.

1457
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,660
Now... Yeah, this is just... This is Metal Gear.

1458
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,280
We're escaping.

1459
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,060
And Liquid is chasing after us.

1460
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:42,320
Oh!

1461
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:44,540
Liquid!

1462
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,780
There's two of them?

1463
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,660
There's two of them?

1464
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,660
I'm getting his butt.

1465
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,420
I'm getting his butt.

1466
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,180
I'm getting his butt.

1467
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,840
Second guy got his butt.

1468
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:58,720
Got his butt.

1469
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,240
Got his butt.

1470
00:57:59,360 --> 00:57:59,780
Got his butt!

1471
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,340
Got his butt!

1472
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,820
Which one's the real one?

1473
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,220
Which one am I supposed to be shooting?

1474
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,140
Ah!

1475
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,020
Either one!

1476
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,360
Two Rexes.

1477
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,160
Oh my gosh, you guys, we did that.

1478
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,080
We did that, we did that.

1479
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,040
Ouch.

1480
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,380
Oh, ouch, ouch.

1481
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,700
Wait, but I was definitely shooting.

1482
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,540
He was not taking any damage.

1483
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,080
Good luck.

1484
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:35,800
I

1485
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,860
want to mow the lawn again, please.

1486
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,640
Let me live, let me live.

1487
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:47,600
Ouch.

1488
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,140
Oh my gosh.

1489
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,040
Where is he?

1490
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,280
Where is he?

1491
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,920
Step on it!

1492
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,860
Who's driving this thing, actually?

1493
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,080
Oh, I am!

1494
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:00,520
Okay.

1495
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,420
It's all me, baby!

1496
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:16,480
Oh, he secretly goes back into the forest.

1497
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,260
Oh my god.

1498
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,580
Oh my god, he's so close though.

1499
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,320
He's taking a lot of damage.

1500
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,840
There he goes, there he goes, there he goes, there he goes, there he goes, there he goes!

1501
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,960
Wait, why isn't he taking any damage?

1502
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:33,840
His health bar is not going down.

1503
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,680
Oh, okay, there it is.

1504
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,400
Now it's going.

1505
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,180
Come on, come on, come on!

1506
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,340
Come on, come on, come on!

1507
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:46,700
It's quicksand!

1508
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:47,480
I think!

1509
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,360
Oh, he's taking a... a nap.

1510
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,110
He's... oh, he's smiling!

1511
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:03,370
What did they give him?

1512
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:04,130
What did they give him?

1513
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:08,110
Awww...

1514
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,250
Awww...

1515
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,000
Awww...

1516
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,200
This might be the biggest quarter, but how could you beat this?

1517
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,640
I don't, right?

1518
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:24,740
I don't, right?

1519
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:24,880
How?

1520
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,100
With many quarters.

1521
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,380
The end.

1522
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,580
There was never any sequels made for Jurassic Park.

1523
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:36,760
Yahoo!

1524
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,040
I pop in and she beats the game.

1525
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:40,940
I'm just too good.

1526
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:41,820
I'm just too...

1527
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:50,570
Not a thought behind those eyes.

1528
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:51,730
He's...

1529
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:54,250
Golly...

1530
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,070
Rex looks so derby at the end.

1531
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,800
And they say modern gaming is pay to win.

1532
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:04,740
Right!

1533
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:07,520
Golly...

1534
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,460
By the way, guys, I have an announcement.

1535
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,160
Um...

1536
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,200
But...

1537
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,260
Thank you, SEGA!

1538
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,620
I have an announcement.

1539
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,600
But I think I should let Elmo tell this one.

1540
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:25,500
I

1541
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:37,330
have an announcement to make.

1542
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:38,590
I

1543
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:44,930
would make the announcement after one song.

1544
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:47,410
What should I sing?

1545
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:49,430
Tell me how's Elmo's song to sing.

1546
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:49,870
Wait.

1547
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:51,130
Oh.

1548
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:53,210
Um...

1549
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,710
What's Elmo's song?

1550
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,980
It's just one of those days where you don't wanna wake up.

1551
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,280
Everything is fucked.

1552
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,340
Everybody sucks.

1553
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,800
You don't really know why.

1554
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,120
What you wanna justify.

1555
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,780
Ripping someone's head off.

1556
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,140
No human contact.

1557
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,980
And if you interact, your life is on contract.

1558
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,500
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker.

1559
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,420
It's just one of those days.

1560
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:36,240
It's all about that he says, she says bullshit.

1561
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,360
I think you better quit.

1562
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,460
Let shit slip.

1563
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,320
Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip.

1564
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,060
It's all about that he says, she says bullshit.

1565
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,140
I think you better quit.

1566
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,600
Fuckin' that shit, fuck.

1567
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,460
It's just one of those days.

1568
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,760
Feelin' like a freight train.

1569
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:53,800
First one to come.

1570
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,520
And if you're stuck up, you're just locked up.

1571
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:04,220
Next in line to get fucked up.

1572
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:06,620
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker.

1573
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,340
It's all about that he says, she says bullshit.

1574
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,360
I didn't have the backing vocals on.

1575
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,640
I didn't have the backing vocals on.

1576
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,020
I didn't have the backing vocals on.

1577
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:18,940
It's all about that he says.

1578
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,960
Why isn't he saying anything?

1579
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,960
I feel like shit.

1580
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,860
My suggestion is to keep your distance.

1581
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,820
Cause right now I'm dangerous.

1582
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,500
We've all felt like shit.

1583
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,200
I've been treated like shit.

1584
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:42,740
All those motherfuckers, I wanna step up.

1585
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:52,580
And if my day keeps going this way, I just might break something tonight.

1586
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:53,480
And if my day keeps going this way, I just might break something tonight.

1587
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:53,900
I broke a chainsaw.

1588
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,520
I'll skin your ass wrong.

1589
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,460
And if my day keeps going this way, I just might break something tonight.

1590
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,240
I broke a chainsaw.

1591
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,360
I'll skin your ass wrong.

1592
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:10,820
And if my day keeps going this way, I just might break your fucking face tonight.

1593
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:17,530
Give me somethin' to break.

1594
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:22,110
Give me somethin' to break.

1595
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,800
About your fuckin' face.

1596
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,360
A chainsaw.

1597
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,760
A motherfuckin' chainsaw.

1598
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,440
So come and get it.

1599
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,260
It's all about the he-says-she-says bullshit.

1600
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,340
I think you better quit like Chisnip or you'll be leaving with a fat lip.

1601
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,120
It's all about the he-says-she-says bullshit.

1602
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,620
I think you better quit talking that shit, huh?

1603
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,320
So come and get it.

1604
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:57,820
Yay!

1605
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,720
Elmo says new outfit day.

1606
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:05,690
Come see it.

1607
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:06,650
Woof woof.

1608
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:18,600
Yay!

1609
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,160
Yeah.

1610
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,120
Um, I guess it's kind of a short stream today.

1611
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,240
I still have my migraine, actually.

1612
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,700
So I think I'm gonna... Um, I knew it would be kind of short today.

1613
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,760
I wanted to take it a bit easy after...

1614
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,880
after yesterday.

1615
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,140
Since yesterday was such a busy day for me!

1616
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:40,520
But, um, yes!

1617
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,340
Uh, uh, new outfit!

1618
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,000
Next Saturday.

1619
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:44,800
Hmm.

1620
01:05:49,370 --> 01:06:00,010
I hope you guys had fun with my- with me collecting my, um, it was my, uh, uh, my fetch quest and- and- and- and Jurassic Park Arcade!

1621
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:00,850
Wimsy!

1622
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:02,050
Thank you so much for the five gift, dude!

1623
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:03,150
Thanks for the silly stream!

1624
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:03,810
New outfit hype!

1625
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:04,370
Yeah!

1626
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:05,090
Yeah!

1627
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:06,290
Oh, gosh.

1628
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:12,210
My throat is still- like I said, I woke up this morning, my throat was so bad because of the- the air!

1629
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,330
And- maybe also flying, too.

1630
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:18,790
Like, the air in- in- on the planes is also so dry.

1631
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:23,190
And I flew twice in one day, so... Thanks for the fun stream of funny bits!

1632
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:23,810
Thank you!

1633
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:24,630
Thank you!

1634
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:25,090
Thank you!

1635
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:25,310
Thank you!

1636
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:27,250
Otsubito, everybody!

1637
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:27,950
Thank you!

1638
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:29,610
I'll see you guys- well, tomorrow.

1639
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:32,290
And if I don't see you tomorrow, I'll definitely- I will see you!

1640
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:35,290
I- I will make the- the- the- the waiting room for the new outfit.

1641
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:38,530
Well, actually, I have to wait for- I've made this- I made it kind of ugly.

1642
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:42,390
I have to wait for the artist to make a nice version that says the actual date.

1643
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:46,900
Thank you, guys!

1644
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:47,640
Thank you, thank you!

1645
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,360
Otsubito!

1646
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:51,270
Thank you!

1647
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:55,350
Having done that sort of Elmo voice myself, I know it's a stray and- oh!

1648
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:57,070
It's not- it wasn't at all!

1649
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:01,840
Did I shine?

1650
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:02,720
Thank you, guys!

1651
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:03,740
Thank you- oh!

1652
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:04,740
I forgot.

1653
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:08,640
Everybody...

1654
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,240
Your quarter...

1655
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,520
From me...

1656
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:13,780
To you...

1657
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,120
Church...

1658
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:17,620
Cherish it.

1659
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:21,920
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

1660
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:22,960
Ha ha ha ha ha!
