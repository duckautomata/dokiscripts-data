1
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,110
Welcome back.

2
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,930
My children.

3
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,640
My brothers and my sisters.

4
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,480
Wait, that would not make you my children.

5
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,140
Wait, are they brothers and sisters or are they children?

6
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,960
It's children.

7
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,400
No.

8
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,390
It's...

9
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,050
I'm the sister.

10
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,780
I have blood on my forehead.

11
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,560
It's from all that sweet, sweet exercising I've been doing.

12
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,700
Don't worry about it.

13
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,960
When you were brushing your teeth, did you miss?

14
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,060
I had spaghetti right before this.

15
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,840
I was like, oh my gosh.

16
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,260
You know when you have something and you're like, all I can taste is that thing?

17
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,720
I was like, okay, spaghetti is great and all, but I just don't want to taste any more spaghetti.

18
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,460
Can I get a...

19
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,560
Let's go, Dodgers!

20
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,840
Let's go, Dodgers!

21
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,190
It's the sauce.

22
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,330
It's the spaghetti sauce on my forehead.

23
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,670
Garlic bread.

24
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,130
Garlic bread!

25
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,090
Oh my gosh!

26
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,890
You reminded me I had a garlic bread and I forgot.

27
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:58,970
No!

28
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,370
I made garlic bread.

29
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,610
I forgot to have it.

30
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,130
Oh my gosh, it's still in the oven.

31
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:08,790
Oops.

32
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:09,990
It's off.

33
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:10,750
Don't worry.

34
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,470
It's probably not burnt, I think.

35
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,350
I think it's okay.

36
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,040
Look at your bread.

37
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,500
No, I don't want to eat it now.

38
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,020
I'm full.

39
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,060
I ate all the spaghetti.

40
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,600
She hates garlic bread?

41
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:31,940
No.

42
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,800
What am I, a vampire?

43
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,140
No, I'm a ghost.

44
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,100
I've been a zombie.

45
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,580
I'm a ghost.

46
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,500
I was an angel.

47
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,200
I'm ticking off all the supernatural creature boxes.

48
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,140
Did you hear the Vatican just revealed a cute anime girl mascot?

49
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,820
No way.

50
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,900
Actually?

51
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,610
Yes?

52
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,730
Hold on, I'm looking this up right now.

53
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,570
No way.

54
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,690
Four hours ago.

55
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,410
Wait, why are her... Wait, is this the right girl?

56
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,010
Oh!

57
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,770
Oh my god.

58
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,050
She's so cute!

59
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,050
Wait, Lucy?

60
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,470
Is that how you say it?

61
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,630
How do you say her name?

62
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,930
Luce.

63
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:40,910
Oh, Luce.

64
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,210
Luce.

65
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,450
Which is it?

66
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,730
Luce.

67
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,390
Hold on.

68
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,210
Uh...

69
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,710
Into Italian.

70
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,290
Italiano.

71
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,810
What?

72
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,190
It says here that it's Italian for light.

73
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,850
I put in light into Google Translate and it does not give me that.

74
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:08,870
It gives me this.

75
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:09,770
Leggera.

76
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,990
Yahweh.

77
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:15,870
Yahweh.

78
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,790
Oh, it's Latin?

79
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,850
Okay, well, this article is wrong.

80
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,290
Luce.

81
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,110
That's not right either.

82
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,090
Google Translate, what's wrong with you?

83
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,050
It's not Latin.

84
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,090
Wait.

85
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,290
I don't know what's correct anymore.

86
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,590
I don't know anything anymore.

87
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,770
Oh my gosh, it's so cute, the little character.

88
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,290
Oh my gosh.

89
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:58,770
Why though?

90
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,270
Okay, is this a YouTube video?

91
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,950
Hold on, I'm muting it just in case.

92
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,810
Why does she have like blood on her shoes?

93
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,150
Why does she have blood on her shoes though?

94
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,380
Hold on, let me screenshot it.

95
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,320
Look at that, she's got blood on her...

96
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,540
Don't mess with the Vatican.

97
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,840
What is thine favorite passage?

98
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,180
Mine is Ezekiel 2320.

99
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,860
It speaks to me personally.

100
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,180
What's that one?

101
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,320
Mayah!

102
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,180
Welcome to my bishop.

103
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,060
Thank you!

104
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,380
Oh, is it mud?

105
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,120
Oh, is it mud?

106
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,100
I don't know.

107
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,400
It's kind of terrifying.

108
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,000
Looks like a smile that would absolutely destroy you.

109
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,500
Why has she got mud on her shoes anyway?

110
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,060
The valley of death.

111
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,440
Hope you're feeling okay, Mayah.

112
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,160
I recently bought a 90's anime series on DVD and didn't realize until today that David Hader voice is the main guy.

113
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,560
Is it Fushigi Yugi?

114
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,740
Because if it is, I know.

115
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,400
You have blood on your forehead.

116
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,000
I know.

117
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,160
Sorry for getting you banned in Matara's chat, but it was really funny.

118
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,460
Road, it was you!

119
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,340
She's a shepherd, so she has mud on her boots.

120
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,120
I think they need to recolor it.

121
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,060
I think the brown... If it's brown...

122
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,160
I think against the green just makes it look very red.

123
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,880
Or is it just me?

124
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,540
Is it just me?

125
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,040
It looks red.

126
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,820
I think they need to...

127
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,400
It's kind of scary.

128
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,140
Oh, goodness.

129
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,040
How excited... I just want to say how excited all the wists are for 3.0.

130
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,100
Everyone is very, very hyped.

131
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,220
You deserve the shiny new Korone voice.

132
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,200
Have confidence.

133
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,480
Thank you!

134
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,760
Could be clay.

135
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,560
Possibly, yeah.

136
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,900
There's red clay.

137
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,620
As for how I'm feeling, yeah, I'm feeling so much better.

138
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,100
I'm not 100%.

139
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,680
But I think I'm good enough to stream at least.

140
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
At the very least.

141
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,480
I'm not in so much pain anymore.

142
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,300
Zen, welcome to membership!

143
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,260
Thank you!

144
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,170
So...

145
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,710
Pain be gone.

146
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,850
Basically, I had some sort of reaction on my face.

147
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,270
And like...

148
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,150
I basically...

149
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,210
Okay, this is gonna sound so horrible.

150
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,970
Sorry, I'm really embarrassed.

151
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,270
Talking about it.

152
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,550
Oh my gosh.

153
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,090
I basically...

154
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,850
I looked like the Joker in the Dark Knight for a couple days.

155
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,230
It was kind of horrible.

156
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,630
And so I couldn't move my mouth.

157
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,290
Without...

158
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,070
You know what I say?

159
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,870
I'm gonna become the Joker sometimes.

160
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,870
I actually did.

161
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,770
And I like...

162
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,610
It was just so bad.

163
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,990
I guess it was some kind of allergy.

164
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,790
I don't know.

165
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,150
I have no idea.

166
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,270
But it's nearly gone.

167
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,690
Luckily, it doesn't show up on camera.

168
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,770
So you guys can't tell.

169
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,050
It's all the makeup and stuff I'm wearing.

170
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,770
Joker cosplay this Halloween.

171
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,030
Honestly, if I had gone to a...

172
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,290
I could have gone to any haunted house.

173
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,110
And they would have hired...

174
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,350
I mean, they should hire me anyway.

175
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,050
I'm a ghost.

176
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,910
They would be like, whoa, scary ghost.

177
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,310
But then also...

178
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,610
Oh my gosh, they could have put me in Phasmophobia.

179
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,590
And I would have fit right in.

180
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,470
I'm the Joker, baby.

181
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,410
Yesterday.

182
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,170
I laugh about it now that I'm not in pain.

183
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,070
And that I'm feeling better.

184
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,690
But I was like...

185
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,330
Oh my gosh.

186
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,210
I was like just...

187
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,930
I was sobbing from all the...

188
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,010
From how much it hurt.

189
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,890
And then...

190
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,490
The tears would...

191
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,450
Touch my face.

192
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,230
And I would...

193
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,890
The saltiness would burn even more.

194
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:05,850
And I'm just like...

195
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,150
It was a rough couple of days.

196
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,590
But I'm better now.

197
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,670
Possessing Freddy Fazbear.

198
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,210
I don't...

199
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,910
Freddy Fazboar.

200
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,320
But I'm okay.

201
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,500
I'm so sorry I had to cancel streams.

202
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
I'm really sorry.

203
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,360
And I had to move some stuff around.

204
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,060
I had to...

205
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,920
Move DMC to tomorrow.

206
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,260
And...

207
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,980
Astrobot to Saturday.

208
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,920
Oh my gosh.

209
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,660
Being a ghost is just...

210
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,960
As bad as being alive, I think.

211
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,220
You can't win in life and you can't win in afterlife.

212
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,980
It's so messed up.

213
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,580
Moving your mouth is important too.

214
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,040
I know.

215
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,460
I couldn't speak.

216
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,780
And I couldn't eat either.

217
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,340
I couldn't open my mouth to eat a lot.

218
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,400
So I would just...

219
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,740
I got smoothies and stuff.

220
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,420
I forgot to tell you how great you did on the karaoke relay.

221
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,240
You were so much fun despite everything going on.

222
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,400
Thank you!

223
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,480
Last night I was...

224
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,440
Mostly feeling better to stream, I'll be honest.

225
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,840
But I wanted to give it a little bit extra time to...

226
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,760
Fully...

227
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,440
Calm down.

228
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,380
I think we're there.

229
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,860
Take care, big day coming up.

230
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,540
I know, I was so worried.

231
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,800
But I'm glad I could at least do the karaoke.

232
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,760
I had a lot of fun.

233
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,940
Even though...

234
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,500
Some people...

235
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,840
Didn't seem to appreciate...

236
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,580
Some of my songs.

237
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,520
You need to answer for that monster mash.

238
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,160
My right ear left out.

239
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,540
I don't know what happened.

240
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,660
I'm so angry.

241
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,160
If you guys don't know the context.

242
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,800
I did a karaoke relay.

243
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,000
That was a crime.

244
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,500
I'm gonna say something that's gonna probably piss you guys off even more.

245
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
You can thank TikTok.

246
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,960
I saw someone sing that version on TikTok.

247
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,640
And I was like...

248
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,220
But then, they didn't do the whole song.

249
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,240
So I was like...

250
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,060
I wonder if there's anything else.

251
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,880
And then I found a...

252
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,800
Another site that had like...

253
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,620
Finished lyrics.

254
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,460
So I...

255
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,180
I just kind of mashed them together.

256
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,860
So sorry, these heathens have no taste.

257
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,460
Monstua mash.

258
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,260
Hey chat, make sure to vote for Mint in the best vtuber in the streamer awards.

259
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,200
Because she's the very best.

260
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,340
Thank you, GoldenFoxy.

261
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,040
Actually, I voted for Doki.

262
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,540
Since she tweeted about it.

263
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,680
I don't really care about the...

264
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,660
Streamer type award.

265
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,540
Things like that.

266
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,580
Like vtuber awards or streamer awards.

267
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,600
Or anything like that.

268
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,600
You know, I really appreciate it.

269
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,640
But, you know.

270
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,840
That's not something I'm like...

271
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,160
Oh my gosh, I wanna win.

272
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,160
But if someone does wanna win, then I'll be like...

273
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,500
Okay, I'll put my vote to you.

274
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,180
Saw the Dragoon Rally called to vote.

275
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,180
Yeah, so...

276
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,760
I think...

277
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,720
I think she has a good chance.

278
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,000
You are my streamer of the year, Minto.

279
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,780
Wow, thank you.

280
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,880
If you think that...

281
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,020
That honestly is all that matters to me.

282
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,460
You know.

283
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,140
And if I do ever win something or like...

284
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,260
I'm nominated for anything like that.

285
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,160
Of course, I'm not gonna be like...

286
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,540
Ew, what the heck.

287
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,080
But...

288
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,460
You know, I would of course appreciate it.

289
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,340
You did not sing the...

290
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,620
Jedward version?

291
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,500
What's that?

292
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,220
Who's that?

293
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,360
Squidward?

294
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,820
Heard of Doobie?

295
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,300
Yeah.

296
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,360
I have.

297
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,220
Yeah, I watched her debut.

298
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,320
Oh my gosh, she's so cute.

299
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,360
She's so cute.

300
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,480
I love trains.

301
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,800
I was like...

302
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,480
Train conductor.

303
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,540
She Doobie making a name for...

304
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,100
Oh my gosh, it's like the perfect name ever.

305
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,580
Sometimes I'm like...

306
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,940
I wish I could change my name.

307
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,540
Because I feel like names that are two syllables are perfect.

308
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,520
You know?

309
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,120
That's why I'm really happy when people call me Minto.

310
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
They just end up being more catchy.

311
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,380
I was like...

312
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,300
Mint is good, but...

313
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,760
I wish I could change my name sometimes.

314
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,140
So thank you for calling me Minto.

315
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,780
Rolls off the tongue.

316
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,800
Yeah, exactly.

317
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,340
And Doobie is just such a good name.

318
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,280
Very fun to say too.

319
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,720
I feel like names that are two syllables are fun to say.

320
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,760
You know what I mean?

321
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,180
Minto, Minto, Minto.

322
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,500
Minto, Minto, Minto.

323
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,860
Minto, Minto.

324
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,480
Bonion.

325
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,020
Bonion.

326
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,200
Three syllables in shambles.

327
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,780
No.

328
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,780
It's just my opinion.

329
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,860
It's just my opinion.

330
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,660
Minto.

331
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,960
Minto is a really good name.

332
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,040
Yippee.

333
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,640
Onion.

334
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,540
Tony, Toto.

335
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,120
Tonto.

336
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,480
Tito.

337
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,500
Good thing I don't have a Y.

338
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:45,800
Toot.

339
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,320
Anyway.

340
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,180
I've been talking for long enough.

341
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,700
Welcome everybody back to Faith.

342
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,740
The Unholy Trinity.

343
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,880
Today we'll be playing...

344
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,960
Chapter...

345
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,140
I almost said Chapter 4.

346
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,260
Chapter 3.

347
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,000
And...

348
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,800
That's the last chapter.

349
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,280
Are they making any more?

350
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,340
I don't think so.

351
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,360
It's the Unholy Trinity.

352
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,120
No, they're not going to make any more.

353
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,800
Rain of bees?

354
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,320
Not bees.

355
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,860
A singular bee!

356
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,740
Oh my god!

357
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,440
Happy birthday!

358
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,560
Chapter 4 is in development?

359
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,580
But it's the Unholy Trinity.

360
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,860
Unholy Quadrinity.

361
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,100
Happy birthday to you.

362
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,720
Happy birthday to you.

363
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,440
Happy birthday, singular bee.

364
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,860
Happy birthday to you.

365
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,080
So yeah.

366
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,220
I think this chapter is a little bit longer.

367
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,620
If I remember correctly.

368
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,480
So let's get into it, bae.

369
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,420
Bae.

370
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,420
Oh, I like the different colors.

371
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,880
Yellow.

372
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,200
White.

373
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,960
Orange.

374
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,540
New game.

375
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,520
Show needles?

376
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,300
Oh no.

377
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,460
Sorry guys.

378
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,680
I'm really not good with needles.

379
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,920
So I'm sorry.

380
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,460
I will not show needles.

381
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,540
I'm really really bad with needles.

382
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,200
So...

383
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,660
Birthday song, Dax.

384
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,800
Are you saying it's your birthday?

385
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,860
Are you saying it's your birthday?

386
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,800
Happy birthday to you.

387
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,140
Happy birthday to you.

388
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,520
Happy birthday to yourself.

389
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Happy birthday to you.

390
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,700
Never seen the censored version?

391
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,800
Well, let's see how it is today.

392
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,620
Grayscale.

393
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,620
September 21st, 1986.

394
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,760
I can't hear you.

395
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:40,900
Yeah, sure.

396
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,400
Based on what I saw during my previous visits.

397
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,520
We could be in for a very long night.

398
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,120
Is this your first exorcism?

399
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,160
Why are they in water?

400
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,340
Are you afraid?

401
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,660
I don't know, sir.

402
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,360
Yes, sir.

403
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,500
I'll give you a word of advice.

404
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,840
Follow my instructions with exactness.

405
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,120
Don't trust what you may see or hear.

406
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:21,760
Yes.

407
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,900
Oh, it's the house.

408
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:25,760
Oh my god.

409
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,300
I can also move.

410
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,240
Excuse me.

411
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,310
Oh my gosh.

412
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,730
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Martin.

413
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,310
This is my assistant, Father Ward.

414
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,210
That's me.

415
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,870
I'm part of this family now.

416
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,830
Shall we begin?

417
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:49,850
Hello, wife.

418
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,570
She's in the back.

419
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,230
I had to tie her up.

420
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,750
I understand.

421
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,110
I'm narrating it because...

422
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,650
It's hard to hear them.

423
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,370
The Lord's servants are here.

424
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,190
If you say so.

425
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:16,890
There I go.

426
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,290
I'm going before you guys.

427
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,670
What's that sound?

428
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,790
This is the attic?

429
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,240
I don't think I'm supposed to be here.

430
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,500
Oh gosh.

431
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,720
She orple.

432
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,220
Oh my god.

433
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,260
They did say that they tied her up, but when they went to go see her...

434
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,300
She was in the attic.

435
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,380
She was missing.

436
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:54,220
Why don't you lead the way?

437
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,960
This is my first ever exorcism.

438
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,720
Why don't you take me there?

439
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,040
Oh, but she's there!

440
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,280
Interesting.

441
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,120
Oh my god.

442
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,020
Hello, Amy?

443
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,100
Konichiwa?

444
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,000
Can you hear me, Amy?

445
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,780
I love the vibes of this game.

446
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,380
I know, right?

447
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,200
She's talking to me!

448
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,300
My nightmares.

449
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,820
October 28th, 1987.

450
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,060
Three days until the profane Sabbath.

451
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,640
And welcome to chapter three!

452
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,080
Oh my gosh.

453
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,960
That's so hard to read.

454
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,320
John.

455
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,980
We don't have much time.

456
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,420
The profane Sabbath is almost upon us.

457
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,940
If they find Nate and Jason, they will perform a ritual on them to call forth a demon of unspeakable power.

458
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,060
The name of the demon is Malthus.

459
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,900
I am in the process of discovering their whereabouts.

460
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,700
I will contact you again soon.

461
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,000
We must not let them do to the boys what they did to Amy.

462
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,420
Father Garcia.

463
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,320
If you...

464
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,480
It would be interesting if Father Garcia doesn't live.

465
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,660
And it kind of carried over into this game.

466
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,920
That save, if you had it, you know?

467
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,000
Wait, October 28th?

468
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,640
That's today!

469
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,660
Lilacs may bloom, but evergreen stays mint.

470
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,020
Through seasons change and warmth to gloom.

471
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,000
Forgive me for I am a simp.

472
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,100
No, I didn't!

473
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,360
Yeah, I'm not going in there.

474
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,040
No, I didn't plan that at all!

475
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,860
Don't say the demon's name.

476
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,860
It gives him power.

477
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,060
John.

478
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,860
I can't find Nate or Jason Martin in the state foster care system.

479
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,700
It's possible that after what happened last year they went to live with relatives.

480
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,900
I will try to find out what I can.

481
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,680
Meanwhile, go investigate the clinic where Amy worked.

482
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,580
Oh no!

483
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,380
How do you keep syncing with dates and games?

484
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,340
I don't know!

485
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,400
Wait, does that mean my 3.0 is on the profane Sabbath?

486
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,720
Crazy!

487
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,660
We must find the place where they intend to summon Malthus and disrupt their plans.

488
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,400
Vea con Dios, Father Garcia.

489
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,460
Wait, I don't want to leave yet.

490
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,960
Oh my god, my family photos!

491
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,540
Except my wife left me.

492
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,380
It's really sad.

493
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,680
What's downstairs?

494
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,620
Our basement is like way different.

495
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,420
Renovated even.

496
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,640
I think we need to watch out for this leaking problem though.

497
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,420
Our water bill is gonna be insane.

498
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,320
Oh my god.

499
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,860
There's gonna be so much mold!

500
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,860
I think these are just pillars.

501
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,240
Yeah, it's gonna get really moldy.

502
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,480
Wait, how is our basement so different from before though?

503
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Alright, let's check out this note.

504
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,380
Stinky mold demon.

505
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,160
Nasty!

506
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,080
Get out of here, mold!

507
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,440
I'm the mold priest!

508
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,680
Oh my god, that would be a sick business.

509
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,640
You come in dressed as a priest, but you're really here to take care of the mold?

510
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,880
You've got a mold problem!

511
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,360
I don't know why it sounds like Mickey Mouse though.

512
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,100
I'm gonna walk there.

513
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,760
Hup hup hup hup!

514
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,120
Hello?

515
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,360
Neighbor?

516
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,580
Oh my god!

517
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,020
I think I vaguely remember this.

518
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,620
What are they watching?

519
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,320
Oh my god, they're watching anime.

520
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,140
Are you an otaku too?

521
00:29:59,180 --> 00:29:59,960
Knock knock!

522
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,600
Hmm...

523
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,580
Is this the Rick rule?

524
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,640
No, it's not.

525
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,540
Is it actually?

526
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,800
Notorious PSG!

527
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,200
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

528
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,820
Mold-sersis?

529
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,200
Come on, it's time to find the door to darkness.

530
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,660
Can I keep walking?

531
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,260
Na na na na na...

532
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,160
I recognize 2loveru anywhere.

533
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
That's concerning.

534
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,740
That's concerning.

535
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,260
Is it really a Rick rule?

536
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,220
Oh, I think I see it.

537
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,880
Wait, this part I don't see though.

538
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,000
Never gonna give, never gonna give, give you up!

539
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,960
Alright, it.

540
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,540
Okay, don't stand in the middle of the road, priest.

541
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,800
What about the other side?

542
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,200
I'm the creepiest.

543
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,180
Everybody is just like, watch out for that priest in the neighborhood.

544
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,060
That guy is so weird.

545
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,740
He goes around and looks in your windows.

546
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,680
Oh my god!

547
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,940
This is the most popular show ever!

548
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,640
Everybody is watching it.

549
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,280
It must be...

550
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,520
Naruto!

551
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,520
Alright, let's go.

552
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,440
Leave?

553
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,040
Yes?

554
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,860
Bing bing bong...

555
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,340
Bing bing bong...

556
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,760
Bing bing bing bong...

557
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,420
We are fighting a dream...

558
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:48,260
Does it say Amy and graffiti on the wall?

559
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,360
Hello?

560
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,780
Boy golly.

561
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,280
Oh my god!

562
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,060
I could have gotten run over just then.

563
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,900
Why did you park on the wrong side?

564
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,240
You turn around.

565
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,460
Oh my god.

566
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,240
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running!

567
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,420
Y'all got any Jesus in your house?

568
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,020
Can I get run over actually?

569
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,010
Test it?

570
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,140
Police officer!

571
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,060
Police officer!

572
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,320
We got isekai'd.

573
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,180
Oh my gosh!

574
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,240
I should have known that that was...

575
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,960
Real.

576
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,680
I caught up on...

577
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,380
Re Zero yesterday.

578
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:58,360
Father Garcia told me to stop watching this scary vtuber ghost girl or a demon will take my soul.

579
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,360
Spicy!

580
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,600
I think I have to find another entrance.

581
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,400
Here we go.

582
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,680
Ko...

583
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,880
Wa...

584
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,240
Ran...

585
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,400
Beelzefest!

586
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,620
Ah yeah!

587
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,120
Calling all Metal fans!

588
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,000
Beelzefest 1987 rocks the hell out of Hartford.

589
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,240
Friday night 10pm to 2am.

590
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,060
Featuring appearances by...

591
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,200
When all is said and done.

592
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,700
Trust no corpse.

593
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,400
The horror is dead.

594
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,660
Basement 2.

595
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,580
What does that mean?

596
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,180
Everybody doesn't care about Basement 1.

597
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,060
Basement 2?

598
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,460
Tsk.

599
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,780
Return to bondage.

600
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,340
Among the bloodied.

601
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,940
Lying still in silence.

602
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,140
Mother of Shadow.

603
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,020
The door to Afterbirth.

604
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,720
The sequel to Basement...

605
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,140
Advance sale tickets.

606
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:04,800
$3.

607
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,480
Admission at door $5.

608
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:08,680
Yo!

609
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,160
So cheap.

610
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,200
Shadow the Hedgehog's mom.

611
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,300
Huh?

612
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,480
You feel watched.

613
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,400
So creepy.

614
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,300
Oh my goodness.

615
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,760
The music sounds very...

616
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,860
Just a little bit like the Exorcism music.

617
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,480
Facts!

618
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,180
To Rhonda Erickson from...

619
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,120
Gary Miller!

620
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,940
Hi Rhonda.

621
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,460
Just a couple of reminders after last week's visit.

622
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,540
Please keep your desk tidy.

623
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,480
Our patients need to feel at ease with their healthcare experience.

624
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,560
Remember our sales points.

625
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,300
Clean.

626
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,080
Quick.

627
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,180
Courteous.

628
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:06,120
Do not return any calls from the Department of Health before notifying me first or leaving a message with Tiffany.

629
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,140
We cannot afford another surprise inspection.

630
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,580
Oof.

631
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:18,400
Please do call me on my direct personnel line if you happen to hear back from Ms. Martin.

632
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,040
One more thing.

633
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,000
Keep Jeffrey out of sight.

634
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:24,920
Remember.

635
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,380
Gary loves you.

636
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,500
And facts.

637
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,140
Finally, somebody loves me.

638
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,140
Why'd the music stop?

639
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,260
Oh gosh.

640
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,620
It makes me so uneasy.

641
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,260
Note to self.

642
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,860
Pills do not dissolve in IV drip well.

643
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,820
Too weak.

644
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,640
Patients waking up before process is complete.

645
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:59,900
Sooner or later they will realize they are having the same hallucinations.

646
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,380
Suggest concentrated injectable version.

647
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,270
What is this?

648
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,130
Baby.

649
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,450
Baby.

650
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:16,570
Baby.

651
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,350
Snail?

652
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:26,710
Baby!

653
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,470
Oh my god, the baby scared me.

654
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,830
Yeah, I know.

655
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,530
Oh my god, that scared me so much.

656
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,530
I didn't even try to go up to it.

657
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,730
Oh, we can get our...

658
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,870
This chair looks haunted.

659
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,230
Ok, nevermind.

660
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,950
Oh, it's just in the...

661
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,810
It's the...what's it called?

662
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,490
Corner for bad children.

663
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,250
Oh guys, I'm so scared.

664
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,170
I'm scared.

665
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,130
It's so quiet.

666
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,330
I feel like I'm going to get chased in any second right now.

667
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,130
Baby, baby, baby jump scare.

668
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,850
I

669
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,530
think I died.

670
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,010
Oh my gosh, that scared the heck out of me.

671
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,950
This is one way to move.

672
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,350
Oh my god.

673
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,990
I need to hide.

674
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:53,910
I'm hiding?

675
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,200
I'm hiding?

676
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,140
Oh my god.

677
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,960
Oh my god.

678
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,100
Ok, but the one in the top right kind of looks...

679
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,720
I don't know.

680
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,960
Is this loss?

681
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,260
No, it's not.

682
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,380
Oh, I see it!

683
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,240
It's...Oh my god, there's loss on the...

684
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,900
What's...

685
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,240
That's so messed up.

686
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,770
Not...No way!

687
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,080
He doesn't see me, right?

688
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,460
Oh, can I go now?

689
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,580
I think this is my chance.

690
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,600
Go.

691
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,560
Don't say I need to hide again though.

692
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,740
I'll be too scared.

693
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,680
I think if I...

694
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:54,880
Where?

695
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,520
Wait, where?

696
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,280
Oh my god, I'm going to die.

697
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,800
Where do I hide?

698
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,880
There's nowhere to hide!

699
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:02,920
Up the stairs!

700
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,260
Ok.

701
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,200
I think he noticed me.

702
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,280
I think maybe with the bodies...

703
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,720
Understandable.

704
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,160
Ok, let's hide.

705
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,940
I need to hide.

706
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,820
That rotoscope scene is a reference to an old horror movie that influenced the Silent Hill theme.

707
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,900
Jacob's Ladder.

708
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,260
Really?

709
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,520
I don't think I've ever seen it.

710
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,060
I've heard of it, but I've never seen it.

711
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,500
He's going to look at that guy.

712
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,380
He's just like...

713
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,730
He's going to look at this guy.

714
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,040
He's like...

715
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,100
He's going to look at the other guy.

716
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,440
He's like...

717
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:00,960
Woo!

718
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,860
I think I'm moving, yeah.

719
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,060
Wiggle!

720
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,400
Wiggle, priest, wiggle!

721
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,460
Ok, wiggle.

722
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,440
Alright, I'm spamming down.

723
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,480
Spamming, spam, spam, spam, spam.

724
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,080
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

725
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,760
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying!

726
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,780
Maybe like right in here.

727
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,740
Tetris.

728
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,800
Tetris, Tetris.

729
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,600
I'm amongst the bodies.

730
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,410
He's going to go upstairs.

731
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,240
Is he leaving?

732
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,380
Ok.

733
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,320
Priest, how are you going to get yourself out of this one, man?

734
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,300
Do I go through this door?

735
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,680
Bust it down.

736
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,060
Ok.

737
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,100
Ok.

738
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:18,200
Up the stairs.

739
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,220
I guess.

740
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,360
Oh my god, the police!

741
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,760
I didn't do anything!

742
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,420
Jacob's ladder is extremely good.

743
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,760
Ok, let's leave then.

744
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,140
Wait, hold on.

745
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,640
Before we go, what's behind this door?

746
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:42,640
Police?

747
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,600
You're going to protect me, ok?

748
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,440
I guess nothing that we can tell.

749
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,880
What if I go back up?

750
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,060
I don't think he thinks I did this.

751
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,460
The door is later.

752
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,400
Oh, he's gone.

753
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,620
He was afraid of the police.

754
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,960
Probably because he's a criminal.

755
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,240
Criminal demon!

756
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,620
You're under arrest for being...

757
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,440
too hot.

758
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,080
Because you're from hell.

759
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,000
Ok.

760
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,920
The boss is...

761
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,500
Pure, pure, pure, pure, pure, pure!

762
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,760
I like how he sometimes just turns around.

763
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,100
He doesn't always have his gun out, just sometimes.

764
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,460
Ok, don't leave too far.

765
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,860
We're going up together.

766
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,700
Is there something in the window or am I crazy?

767
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,420
Baby...

768
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,860
I swear!

769
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,820
There was something here!

770
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,720
You're under arrest for being over the cute limit.

771
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,680
Sorry.

772
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,340
These baby jumpscares are freaking me out.

773
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,120
Officer, there is a thing here.

774
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,380
Officer, don't let me go ahead of you.

775
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,680
You are the one with the weapon.

776
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,440
Please, officer.

777
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,900
Don't draw it on me like that so fast.

778
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,640
Oh, we just got a save?

779
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,320
How did you get inside?

780
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,000
Ok, you can have it.

781
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,540
How did you know I had a crowbar?

782
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,580
Mortis...

783
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,000
I got you!

784
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,440
I got you!

785
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,110
I think I'm dead.

786
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,530
Bye bye.

787
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,590
I thought he would die.

788
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,030
I thought I was stronger than that.

789
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,030
My faith is not strong enough, you guys.

790
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,270
My faith is not strong enough.

791
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,210
Yeah, yeah.

792
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:13,690
Wait, when does he jump in?

793
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,430
I'm ready.

794
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:34,530
Ok, here he comes.

795
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:35,730
Other guy.

796
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:42,930
Shoot it!

797
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:45,690
Shoot him!

798
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,090
Oh my God, why are you running towards him?

799
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:49,810
What are you doing?

800
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,750
What about the crowbar?

801
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:53,430
Oh my God.

802
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:54,350
Run!

803
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:54,770
Freeze!

804
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:55,570
I mean cop!

805
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:56,330
Cop!

806
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,330
Run away!

807
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,100
Our faith is strong.

808
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:04,760
Oh my God.

809
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,400
Why don't you shoot it?

810
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,200
Oh good job.

811
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,520
A cop with one bullet.

812
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,440
For real.

813
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,440
Why didn't you shoot it?

814
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,760
Oh my God!

815
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:26,640
What's that?

816
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,370
Who was that driving by?

817
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,490
Do you think the door is open?

818
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:44,870
Wait, the windows are fixed.

819
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:46,350
Interesting.

820
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,150
The rat.

821
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:50,750
We gotta get the rat.

822
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:52,770
Little rat.

823
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,910
Is there anything else in here?

824
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:56,550
I'm scared.

825
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,090
Secrets?

826
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,010
Is there secrets in here?

827
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:08,410
Oh there is.

828
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:11,990
Is it the door?

829
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:12,790
Is it open now?

830
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:13,770
The one down here?

831
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:17,770
Oh my God, it's so scary.

832
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,410
Wait, it's not open I don't think.

833
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:22,710
Oh gosh, I can see their feet.

834
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:23,630
Wait, join...

835
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,530
It says join us at the bottom!

836
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:27,970
Oh my God.

837
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:28,730
Wow!

838
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,930
That didn't say that before.

839
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,630
Get in the bed.

840
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,860
Can I actually go there?

841
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,220
Is it a secret boss?

842
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,400
I think I saw someone say.

843
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,140
Oh gosh.

844
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:51,820
Yes?

845
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,600
Am I gonna be so sad?

846
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,560
Am I prepared for this?

847
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,040
I don't know.

848
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,340
I'm here!

849
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,600
I've joined you!

850
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:01,740
Hello?

851
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:01,860
Hello?

852
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:10,240
Stay there.

853
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:10,780
Oh ok.

854
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,640
Stay still.

855
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,460
Oh gosh.

856
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,120
I can't look.

857
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,600
I think the preacher just likes it.

858
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,460
I think he just wants to...

859
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,200
I think he was just like this seems kinda neat.

860
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,600
Oh I don't like that.

861
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,240
Oh my God!

862
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,420
Maybe... Why did you strap yourself in?

863
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,800
Why did you do this?

864
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,920
I've never seen this before you guys.

865
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,600
Oh I thought it was a crane game for a second.

866
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,420
Osmosis.

867
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:06,920
Oh I saw his peepee.

868
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,620
Is that a baby?

869
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:17,700
Oh God.

870
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,080
At least it's saved.

871
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,560
Is it a boss baby?

872
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,240
I think so.

873
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,300
Boss baby be gone!

874
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,490
Oh she's got the baby.

875
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,900
I don't think she's the one to ask.

876
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:55,780
Gary.

877
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,020
You know who Gary is.

878
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,080
Oh my God!

879
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,840
That's the realest thing he's ever said.

880
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,080
Guys is this boss hard?

881
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:20,720
I'm scared.

882
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,740
Oh my God!

883
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,120
Little baby.

884
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,820
Oh no.

885
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:28,520
Oh no.

886
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,120
Oh no there's so many babies.

887
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,160
Oh my God.

888
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,120
Too many babies already.

889
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,880
Oh no, no, no.

890
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,580
Too many babies.

891
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,640
You can do this?

892
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,900
I'm scared.

893
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:40,980
It's the babies.

894
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:41,940
Ok,

895
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:51,020
good, good.

896
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,260
Baby.

897
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,220
Oh gosh, so many babies.

898
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,280
So many babies.

899
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,100
Oh my God, way too many babies.

900
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:00,860
Too many babies.

901
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,200
I went the wrong way.

902
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:02,880
Oh my God.

903
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,560
Oh shit, I'm gonna die by baby.

904
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,220
Oh my God.

905
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,960
There's so many babies.

906
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,660
Oh God.

907
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,260
Oh my God.

908
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,480
Oh my God, there's too many babies.

909
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,760
Let them all congregate.

910
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,760
Congregate the babies.

911
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,560
And then take out the babies.

912
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

913
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,020
Ok.

914
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,740
I'm running away from the babies.

915
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,880
Ok, don't get too close to the walls.

916
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,120
Or the windows.

917
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,380
From the window to the wall.

918
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,100
Babies.

919
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:32,920
Babies inbound.

920
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,620
Babies inbound.

921
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,400
Oh my God.

922
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:34,900
Oh my God.

923
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,340
Congregate the babies.

924
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,140
Oh gosh.

925
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:38,580
No, no, no.

926
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,040
I'm gonna die.

927
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,380
Death by baby.

928
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,000
Oh my God.

929
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:41,540
No, no, no.

930
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:41,880
Please.

931
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,840
There's too many babies you guys.

932
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,800
I'm not fast enough.

933
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,220
The babies are faster.

934
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,600
How are they so fast?

935
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,900
They are little crawling babies.

936
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:50,360
Oh my God.

937
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:50,980
Do you hear that?

938
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:51,500
Oh my God.

939
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:51,820
Oh my God.

940
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,120
Oh my God.

941
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,160
Baby.

942
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,140
Baby sounds.

943
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,180
Baby sounds.

944
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,520
Oh stop.

945
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:00,980
Please.

946
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:01,740
How many babies?

947
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,140
Oh my God.

948
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,280
This is literally Metal Gear.

949
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,840
There's so many babies and they just don't stop coming.

950
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,320
Please.

951
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,040
Little babies.

952
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,580
Oh my God.

953
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,420
This is the Metal Gear Ray fight actually.

954
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,300
Go for the mom.

955
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,740
Wait, actually...

956
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,060
Is she the real horror?

957
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,340
No.

958
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:21,940
Hold on.

959
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:22,800
I'm getting baby.

960
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,120
I try to fight and I get baby.

961
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,260
Oh my God.

962
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,880
Yes, I have to get the mom.

963
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,540
Oh shit.

964
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,960
But there's too many babies.

965
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:30,960
You guys.

966
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,760
I'm surrounded by babies.

967
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:35,900
Oh my God.

968
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,640
They don't kill you yet?

969
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,760
They don't?

970
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,080
Oh, I see.

971
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,380
I see.

972
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,580
Oh my gosh.

973
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,480
There's too many babies.

974
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,560
What if I just did this?

975
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:04,940
Okay, hold on.

976
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,140
I'm letting them touch me a little bit.

977
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,920
Oh, they're crawling on me.

978
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,600
Oh, they're crawling on me real bad.

979
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,160
Oh my gosh.

980
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,400
Oh, this is not good.

981
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,160
I don't think this is good, you guys.

982
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:26,920
This is not good.

983
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,100
Now do they kill me?

984
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:29,500
Uh-oh.

985
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,260
Baby armor?

986
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,780
What are you talking about baby armor?

987
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,520
Do they kill me now?

988
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,960
Oh, I think they're weaker though.

989
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:40,960
Oh my God.

990
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:41,860
What the hell is that?

991
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,560
She's a lot... She's...

992
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,320
She's free.

993
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,260
She's got less baby.

994
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,320
Oh gosh.

995
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,560
The evil eye baby.

996
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:58,900
Oh gosh.

997
00:52:59,540 --> 00:52:59,960
Okay.

998
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:01,720
Oh my God.

999
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,140
The baby armor is getting damaged.

1000
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:10,580
There's just... There's fewer babies now than there used to be.

1001
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,220
I think... Oh my God!

1002
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,600
Wait, now are they going to kill me?

1003
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,500
Ah, they're so loud.

1004
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,440
These loud ass babies.

1005
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,840
Uh-oh, they're making a new baby creature.

1006
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,360
Okay, I killed it.

1007
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,340
So many babies.

1008
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,320
Oh my God.

1009
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,560
Giant baby ghost.

1010
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,620
Okay, I killed them both.

1011
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,860
Get off of me babies.

1012
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,100
Make me slow.

1013
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:46,000
Okay, so they just make me really slow.

1014
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,160
But as long as I can do this, it's fine.

1015
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,180
I'm still exercising.

1016
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:53,900
No!

1017
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:54,680
No!

1018
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,680
Don't go to your mom!

1019
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,360
Oh my God.

1020
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,660
I can still get her though.

1021
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,600
I'm getting the babies.

1022
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,640
Oh the babies!

1023
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,860
Oh, I think they're gone.

1024
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,300
Did I do it?

1025
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:15,000
This is what the pre-chat wisps sound like when you're late for stream.

1026
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,720
Bottom right giant baby ghost.

1027
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,360
Shut up.

1028
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,220
We did it!

1029
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,940
Oh, what's this?

1030
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,760
Smooth moves, priest.

1031
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,800
Get well soon.

1032
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,820
Oh, thank you!

1033
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:35,700
Thanks Jif.

1034
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:36,560
Oh, sorry.

1035
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,180
Thanks Nan.

1036
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,360
Oh my gosh, Nan.

1037
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,360
I thought about you yesterday because I was looking up...

1038
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:47,060
The joysticks for the official Ace Combat joysticks.

1039
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,380
I was just like... I was wondering if you had them.

1040
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,100
Because I was thinking of getting...

1041
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,320
Them for stream.

1042
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,880
They have the Ace Combat 7 one and then the older one.

1043
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,000
I can't remember what it's for.

1044
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:02,820
Sean!

1045
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:03,960
Welcome to membership!

1046
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:04,560
Thank you!

1047
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,920
But the twins are not here.

1048
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,020
Carry out the works of your god while it is yet day.

1049
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,360
For the night cometh.

1050
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,740
Remember, Gary loves you.

1051
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,440
Lmao!

1052
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,660
Welcome to membership!

1053
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:21,640
Thank you!

1054
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,000
Ding ding!

1055
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,040
We did it!

1056
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,520
We did it, guys!

1057
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,040
Bing bing bong!

1058
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,960
Bing bing bing bing bing bong!

1059
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,300
So wait, so that guarantees us the true slash good end?

1060
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,800
That little fight?

1061
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,560
Oh, no.

1062
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,300
Not yet.

1063
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:49,760
Oh, okay.

1064
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,600
It's part of the true end.

1065
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,260
It's one part.

1066
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:53,540
Okay.

1067
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,360
One of three.

1068
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,360
Okay, there's two more.

1069
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,160
Just let me know when and I'll do it.

1070
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,860
Because I want to see the true end also.

1071
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:01,700
Thanks, lady!

1072
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:02,800
For the five gifted!

1073
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,180
I kind of want to buy them too, but I heard it's hard to do post all manure.

1074
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,520
I hope it's not too expensive.

1075
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,980
I was just looking at them.

1076
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:10,600
I think...

1077
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,620
I can't remember.

1078
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,260
I didn't buy them yet.

1079
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,380
But interesting that it makes it more difficult.

1080
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:24,940
One per sub-chapter.

1081
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:25,980
Ah, I see.

1082
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,720
Was that Gary who went by?

1083
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,700
What if you die by Gary?

1084
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,380
That would be crazy.

1085
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:34,950
Am I good to leave?

1086
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:37,490
Am I good to leave?

1087
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:41,190
Yeah?

1088
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:43,050
Okay.

1089
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:45,850
There's a little more?

1090
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:48,070
Check the cob.

1091
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:49,070
Wait, where is he?

1092
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:51,690
Over here?

1093
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:54,410
Oh!

1094
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:57,970
I didn't know this area was...

1095
00:56:58,690 --> 00:56:59,910
Oh my god, Uboa!

1096
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:04,090
Oh my god.

1097
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,930
We have nothing to say about that.

1098
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:09,070
I don't think we should even be over here.

1099
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:11,710
Villain, thanks for the super chat!

1100
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:12,490
Person!

1101
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,510
Oh my gosh, thank you for the 50 gifted!

1102
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:15,250
Thank you!

1103
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:17,670
Holy moly.

1104
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,010
His gun?

1105
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:22,330
I'm trying to take it, but it won't let me have his gun.

1106
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:25,230
It's okay, I have my faith.

1107
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,810
I keep reading the top as spaghetti.

1108
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,790
Wait, there's even more.

1109
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:33,410
Oh my god, it's the cool S.

1110
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:36,130
A dog in the balls.

1111
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:38,750
No, sorry, there's not a dog in the balls.

1112
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:39,910
I'm just reading it.

1113
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:40,590
That's what it said.

1114
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,420
Oh, okay.

1115
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,580
I think it just loop-de-doops.

1116
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,420
I can't believe Uboa is up there.

1117
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,120
And that our cop... Oh no, I'm so sad about him.

1118
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,280
He protected us.

1119
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,180
Is there anything else over here?

1120
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,500
Airdorf.

1121
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,540
Oh, okay, it's the same loop.

1122
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,660
What is this about, dog?

1123
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:23,280
Nothing.

1124
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,980
Nothing at all.

1125
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,040
Alright, I'm waiting for... Can I get the rat?

1126
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,900
The rat has no faith.

1127
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,160
I think there's something with the rat.

1128
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:38,760
Is there actually?

1129
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:45,830
Rat.

1130
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,210
I can't get him though.

1131
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,750
Oh, cross on here?

1132
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:58,410
No, it doesn't work.

1133
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:02,450
I think because it's an actual... thing.

1134
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,810
Show yourself, thy rat!

1135
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:08,330
Oh.

1136
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:13,840
I can't tell if I'm getting...

1137
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,440
I think I'm getting one guide.

1138
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,680
Guys, I don't think there's anything with the rat.

1139
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,400
You are.

1140
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:34,800
That was close.

1141
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,140
Alright, let's leave now.

1142
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,560
Investigate the clinic.

1143
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:45,320
Once you have time to play Ace Combat again, I will recommend you some video tutorials that will help you catch up to any Ace Combat for now.

1144
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,100
I patiently wait.

1145
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:46,600
Thank you.

1146
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:47,960
Nico!

1147
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:49,460
Welcome to Battleship Deku!

1148
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,400
Was that because of the first boss?

1149
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,800
Don't just stand there, fatherboard!

1150
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,760
Get the book and recite the prayer of exorcism!

1151
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,120
OK!

1152
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,060
Exorcise-o-te-creature-a-salis...

1153
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,820
Let me record.

1154
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:26,540
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

1155
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,140
Oh, there's more to it.

1156
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,600
Adhurote serpens...

1157
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,500
Shit, I'm not fast enough.

1158
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,220
Sorry to get in the way of your...OK.

1159
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,960
Exorcise-o-tabor-dium vivium phantasma!

1160
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:48,540
Why are we leaving these books all over the place?

1161
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,720
Clean up!

1162
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,360
I can't read all that.

1163
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,780
Just paragon like you never before.

1164
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:57,960
Oh my god!

1165
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:00,840
Mother, mother!

1166
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,100
Get them out of here.

1167
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,260
It will use the girl to afflict them.

1168
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,100
Yeah, why are you guys in here?

1169
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:06,500
Come on.

1170
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,600
Come on guys.

1171
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,340
Spooky, they moved!

1172
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,000
Come on parents, what are you doing down here?

1173
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,100
Parents, you're not allowed...this is...no.

1174
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,180
This is an exorcism...you have to have your exorcism clothes on.

1175
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,260
You don't...

1176
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,480
You guys like chill in here.

1177
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,980
It's best that you stay here.

1178
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:32,000
That thing down there, that's not my daughter.

1179
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:34,240
Synchron mixes.

1180
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,500
I don't know what to tell you.

1181
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,260
We need to go assist father Alren.

1182
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,040
Stay here and pray for Amy.

1183
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:54,760
Alright guys, exorcism.

1184
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,140
I wiped off my feet.

1185
01:01:59,140 --> 01:01:59,140
What?

1186
01:01:59,640 --> 01:01:59,980
Oh.

1187
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,160
They're back to normal.

1188
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:03,980
Wait, is that how they were before?

1189
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,180
Take it and save her?

1190
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,320
Are you alive?

1191
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,120
You died?

1192
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:19,480
Don't worry Amy, I'm coming.

1193
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:20,280
Wait!

1194
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,660
Oh my god, he literally said it's dangerous to go alone.

1195
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,540
Take this.

1196
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:32,380
October 29th, 1987.

1197
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,740
Two days until the profane Sabbath.

1198
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:38,580
Good, it's not today anymore you guys.

1199
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,340
It's today, maybe for you.

1200
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,260
It's tomorrow for me.

1201
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,180
Oh my goodness, we got a lot of mail.

1202
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:55,700
John.

1203
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,840
For now, this is the only way I can contact you.

1204
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,320
I think they're watching me.

1205
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,380
I need you to come over as soon as you can.

1206
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,200
The situation has gotten much worse.

1207
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:10,520
My address is 665 Orange Street, Apartment 5A, New Haven, Connecticut, 06511.

1208
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,200
Thank you, Lisa.

1209
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:13,280
P.S.

1210
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:17,940
If for some reason I don't answer the door, get the spare key from my friend Tiffany.

1211
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:20,980
Tiffany.

1212
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,880
Like the one from the clinic?

1213
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:28,820
Yeah, sorry I just doxed Lisa you guys.

1214
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,380
It's for the plot.

1215
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,520
We doxed for the plot, okay?

1216
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,280
We have to.

1217
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:41,840
Doxed.

1218
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,280
I said it so cat.

1219
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:44,480
I was like...

1220
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,320
I didn't even think about it.

1221
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,860
I didn't even think that I was saying some person's address.

1222
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,800
I was just like, la la la.

1223
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,800
Lisa's address.

1224
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,740
I hope nobody goes there.

1225
01:03:59,160 --> 01:03:59,680
John.

1226
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:04,140
There's an apartment building in New Haven where they might be attempting to summon...

1227
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,700
I'm not able to go there myself.

1228
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,260
It's up to you to stop their rituals.

1229
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:12,300
Father Garcia.

1230
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,100
I was on Koa's birthday stream today.

1231
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,780
She did like a call-in thing.

1232
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,240
And I joined.

1233
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:24,960
She's from Idol ES.

1234
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:28,920
And she said... Oh wait, I wonder if we can do this.

1235
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,260
She said my Spanish sounded good.

1236
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,160
Oh.

1237
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,320
She said my Spanish sounded good.

1238
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,580
Sorry if I yawn a lot.

1239
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,500
I had coffee earlier, but I had it like kind of midday.

1240
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:48,020
And so it's like wearing off, but I don't want to drink more coffee.

1241
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,040
I don't want to have so much caffeine, you know?

1242
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,180
Be proud, Mint.

1243
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:01,660
Ha ha ha.

1244
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:07,220
John, I don't know if you're getting my letters or not, but I hope you'll be here soon.

1245
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,460
I really need your help.

1246
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,340
They're in the apartment.

1247
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,040
I see them all the time now.

1248
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,280
I can hear them in the darkness.

1249
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,800
I haven't slept in days.

1250
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,860
When you get here, just come straight to my place.

1251
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,260
Tiffany can't be trusted.

1252
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,700
Don't talk to my neighbors either.

1253
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,360
They won't let me leave.

1254
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:26,160
Lisa.

1255
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,240
Oh my god!

1256
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:28,700
Lisa!

1257
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,420
Let's see how my neighbors are doing.

1258
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,000
Are they still watching the same channel?

1259
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,160
If so, they might be possessed.

1260
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,460
Okay, they're good.

1261
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:42,960
They're watching.

1262
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,020
What the hell is this?

1263
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:44,400
Oh.

1264
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,440
This doesn't look very family friendly.

1265
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,080
Darkwing, welcome to membership.

1266
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:52,740
Thank you.

1267
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:56,440
Mint is a normal ghost being like you or me.

1268
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,660
I don't know.

1269
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:03,920
Your Spanish sounds good.

1270
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,060
You said...

1271
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:08,600
And now the babies are trying to eat you.

1272
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:09,500
What's wrong?

1273
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,940
I eat babies.

1274
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,040
Alright, let's go.

1275
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,220
I also eat babies.

1276
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:38,060
There was a clean parking there.

1277
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,220
Whose purple truck is this?

1278
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,740
It's possessed, maybe.

1279
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:50,060
Oh, can I walk down this street?

1280
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,180
Thanos truck?

1281
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,100
No?

1282
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:55,600
Okay.

1283
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,100
William Aftons?

1284
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:04,200
Among the damned.

1285
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,440
Gosh, the music in this is so freaky.

1286
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:12,860
I say music, but ambiance?

1287
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,740
So scary.

1288
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,440
Who's just leaving their mail out?

1289
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,720
Oh my god, Lisa!

1290
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,820
Hello, Mr. Ward.

1291
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:25,540
I am sorry to have worried you.

1292
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,360
I am perfectly fine.

1293
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:30,100
I have not been feeling like myself lately.

1294
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,300
However, I am much better now.

1295
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,960
Please do not trouble yourself with coming to visit.

1296
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,400
I have decided to take an extended vacation in the country, so you...

1297
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,480
In the country!

1298
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,940
So you will not find me at home.

1299
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,420
Sincerely, Lisa Pearson.

1300
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:49,280
I shall take my other notes from Lisa.

1301
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,300
Okay, see you, Lisa.

1302
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:03,600
For the younger chatters, this is what the world actually looked like before Megaman invented HD reality.

1303
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:04,680
It's true.

1304
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:09,590
Bye, Lisa.

1305
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:10,870
See ya.

1306
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:12,510
Lisa?

1307
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,910
Oh my gosh, I can actually leave!

1308
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:21,830
That's crazy.

1309
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:25,210
Wait, if I leave, do I get an ending or something?

1310
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:28,930
Hot single cultist near you in New Haven.

1311
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:32,630
What apartment is she?

1312
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:33,390
Ping pong.

1313
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:34,510
Lisa?

1314
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:45,470
Wait, does this go upstairs?

1315
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:54,980
5A.

1316
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:55,780
Oh, thank you.

1317
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,720
I think I remember vaguely...

1318
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:05,040
A boss, something, in like a room.

1319
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:05,940
Oh gosh.

1320
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,820
Excuse me.

1321
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,140
A sword.

1322
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:14,400
Oh my god.

1323
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:15,800
Let's go.

1324
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,820
I'll take that.

1325
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,880
Hi from Sapporo.

1326
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,440
Oh my gosh, Seymour.

1327
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:28,180
I've been seeing all your pictures.

1328
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,920
If I had a nickel for every different location within Japan, I'd call it a faith livestream.

1329
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,300
Okay, I'll just wait for that.

1330
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:44,280
Are you going to be at Anime Atlanta by any chance or is it remote?

1331
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,200
I believe... I mean for the concert.

1332
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,620
I'll be there.

1333
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,060
But it's not like a thing with the convention.

1334
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,820
It's just happening at the same weekend as the convention.

1335
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:06,860
And for those curious, it does not overlap with the Hololive concert.

1336
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:10,360
So, you can get your fill of all the concerts.

1337
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,480
Everything initiated... Oh sorry.

1338
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:23,220
Every initiated follower knows that in order to bring about the second death...

1339
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:26,440
One must sacrifice seven...

1340
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,000
Seven...

1341
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,020
Anuses.

1342
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,520
Is that like a little star butt?

1343
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:41,580
I wasn't planning on going to AWA until they announced the Hololive concert taking place the day after yours.

1344
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,160
Yeah, yeah.

1345
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:51,860
You know how like when there's like a little plushie of a character and they have a little star for their butt?

1346
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,940
That's what I think about that.

1347
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:02,360
By passing them through the star carved out of the impure...

1348
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,360
Just think of that as a butt instead.

1349
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,300
Of the impure vessel's face.

1350
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,100
Oh god.

1351
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:15,120
Then shall the unspeakable reward the butt with the second death.

1352
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,880
Such was the fate of that whore, Amy.

1353
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:20,460
Oh my gosh.

1354
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:24,060
My beloved Gary has set his sights far too low.

1355
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:25,740
I will surpass her.

1356
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:27,480
Oh my gosh.

1357
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,460
There's a secret...

1358
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:33,020
There's a secret tunnel here.

1359
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,020
I was hoping you see Dolphy Dream Mint Phantom.

1360
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,340
Have you posted it?

1361
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,220
I have not seen it yet.

1362
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,120
Sometimes...

1363
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,120
Oh this is up.

1364
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:44,900
Hold on.

1365
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,700
Oh yeah, I think I explored everything downstairs.

1366
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:53,820
Sometimes, if you post things on like tags on Twitter, I don't always see them.

1367
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:57,460
I need a color to describe you to my friends.

1368
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,420
Whenever I say green woman, they think of someone else.

1369
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,720
Is there a shade of green you are so I can narrow it down?

1370
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:03,980
A preference of green.

1371
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:06,800
Mint?

1372
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:11,980
Mint?

1373
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:14,000
Mint green?

1374
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:29,110
Mint?

1375
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,280
Mint?

1376
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,940
Wait, do I need to go into the elevator?

1377
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,620
Isn't there something in here as well?

1378
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:46,560
Actually, I'm just gonna take the stairs.

1379
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:55,860
Who's smoking behind the bush?

1380
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:02,280
Yo, this apartment complex is...

1381
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:02,960
Oh gosh.

1382
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,560
I think they have some troubles.

1383
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:06,620
Can I turn this off?

1384
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:09,400
Please?

1385
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:10,580
I don't like it.

1386
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,280
I don't like it.

1387
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:14,920
Oh god.

1388
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:17,780
What is that?

1389
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:21,780
Oh 5A!

1390
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,560
I got it.

1391
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,460
What is clevis?

1392
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:29,080
Oh my god.

1393
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,720
Oh my god, it's starting to...

1394
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:37,250
Oh gosh, this game is so scary.

1395
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:41,570
Why did it just save?

1396
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:44,870
Why did it just save?

1397
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:49,280
Hi, Amy.

1398
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,460
Is that thunder?

1399
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:04,490
Oh gosh.

1400
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,460
This is the worst apartment complex ever.

1401
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:23,040
Imagine having to go all the way down a hallway just to go up.

1402
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,600
It's so obnoxious.

1403
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:28,800
Oh my god.

1404
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,140
Oh 5A.

1405
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,240
I think this is the one.

1406
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:37,400
What's this?

1407
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,680
Well, what are the rules?

1408
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,860
Wait, what's the rules?

1409
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:57,860
Did I miss the rules?

1410
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:00,360
Did I miss the rules?

1411
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:04,700
No.

1412
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,160
Oh my god.

1413
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,740
I almost just quit the game.

1414
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:10,920
I'm so sorry.

1415
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,180
I didn't mean to.

1416
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,980
I thought like exit the menu.

1417
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,660
I haven't found the rules yet.

1418
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,700
Maybe we gotta... Do I have to go all the way to the first floor?

1419
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,640
Whoa.

1420
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:32,380
They have a mold problem.

1421
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:35,880
And I'm just the guy to fix it.

1422
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:37,740
My nephew came into the room.

1423
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:38,840
Do you have anything to say to him?

1424
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:39,680
Hi.

1425
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,100
Don't look.

1426
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:43,920
It's a scary game.

1427
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:52,460
And also, don't follow Timmy's examples because that kid can't spell.

1428
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,420
Elevator friend.

1429
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,700
1, 4, 2, 5.

1430
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,500
1, 4, 2, 5.

1431
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:07,170
1, 4, 2, 5.

1432
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:10,310
6?

1433
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:11,390
Oh, 6.

1434
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:13,170
1, 4, 2, 6.

1435
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:15,830
What's this?

1436
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:18,590
There is no 7th floor.

1437
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:20,030
Okay.

1438
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:24,210
I believe you.

1439
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:29,090
Is the elevator friend the other boss?

1440
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,200
1, 4, 2, 6.

1441
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,480
No, he's a friend.

1442
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:50,230
So if I... Oh my gosh, do I have to go all the way back down to the first floor though to play it?

1443
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:52,790
I actually don't know the rules either though.

1444
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:01,580
No, what I mean is, is he the guy that I need for the true ending.

1445
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,140
Okay, we go inside.

1446
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,200
No, he's unrelated.

1447
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,140
Oh, it's saved.

1448
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:16,780
Oh boy.

1449
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:17,980
Oh boy golly.

1450
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:18,380
Lisa?

1451
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,400
Lisa, are you in there?

1452
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,680
What the heck is that?

1453
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:28,580
Oh, the dagger.

1454
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:33,670
What's that sound?

1455
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:37,090
I got a key.

1456
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:46,410
If you wish to break the seal of Alu, your answer lies in the bloodstained knife in the face hiding in the deep dark.

1457
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:52,430
But only those who have ascended to the highest point can descend to the lowest depths.

1458
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:56,050
Remember, Gary loves you.

1459
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:04,950
Oh my gosh, the salt.

1460
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:06,630
The salt's been disturbed.

1461
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,050
And there's salt at the door even too.

1462
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:11,490
I wouldn't be able to come in here.

1463
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:14,850
You guys wouldn't do that though, right?

1464
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:20,670
You guys wouldn't put salt in front of your door to stop me from coming in, right?

1465
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:26,330
That would be so mean.

1466
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:32,710
You guys are probably like, I mean, I want...

1467
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:34,110
Oh, where did the candles come from?

1468
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:36,250
I wasn't meant to haunt me.

1469
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:38,630
All the time.

1470
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,220
Stop with the salt!

1471
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:52,030
What room was the dagger in?

1472
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:54,330
I guess we'll find it.

1473
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:56,690
Poor boy.

1474
01:18:57,970 --> 01:18:59,190
She's stinky.

1475
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:03,650
Where are the candles?

1476
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:10,390
Was it three, boy?

1477
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:13,850
Three, boy.

1478
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:15,510
Ah, nope, nope, nope.

1479
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:19,690
No, it was not.

1480
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:26,410
Mint is your sleep paralysis demon.

1481
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,570
I put salt at the door so you can't leave.

1482
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:35,170
That would be a salt.

1483
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:36,470
You mean a waste of salt.

1484
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:37,450
Totally.

1485
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:42,270
It's this one.

1486
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,140
The dagger is bloodied.

1487
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:53,920
These guys are so fast and efficient.

1488
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,400
I got it.

1489
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,420
One seal.

1490
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:10,440
Now we have to duel the guy in the darkness.

1491
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,180
Whatever that means.

1492
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:16,480
Why won't you let me... Just push!

1493
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,820
Push, father, push!

1494
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,080
He's just like, I'm so weak.

1495
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,480
I can only hold up my little crucifix.

1496
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:27,900
My arms are spaghetti.

1497
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:31,320
Oh my goodness.

1498
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,800
Is it telling me to go in the elevator?

1499
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,020
But I'm not on the first floor.

1500
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,120
I don't know the rules.

1501
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,660
I don't know the rules with my buddy.

1502
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:43,720
Mint is welcome, as long as she brings Omiyage.

1503
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:55,120
Oh my gosh, this thunder is wild.

1504
01:20:58,180 --> 01:20:59,380
Oh, just the numbers?

1505
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,120
I want to start on the first floor.

1506
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,520
Or do you guys consider this the ground floor?

1507
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,080
I didn't... I realized... Or did I look over here?

1508
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,040
I realized to look in this one, but...

1509
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:18,600
There's a basement.

1510
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:25,310
Oh, I don't like this.

1511
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:28,810
Uh...

1512
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:30,490
Nope, nope.

1513
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:31,450
No.

1514
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:45,250
I don't have a flashlight, you guys.

1515
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:47,070
That would be crazy to go down there.

1516
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:52,050
Let's do our little friend... Wait, what was that?

1517
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:53,370
Hold on, I gotta check my notes.

1518
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,040
Scary picture.

1519
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,040
One, four, two, six.

1520
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:05,860
Okay.

1521
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,680
One...

1522
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:26,760
Four...

1523
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:29,000
Two...

1524
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,540
Six.

1525
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:51,620
Wait a second, what do the numbers say?

1526
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:51,760
Okay.

1527
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:55,900
Friend!

1528
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:00,840
Friend?

1529
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:15,780
Spam floor seven.

1530
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:19,220
Wait, it's eight, nine, ten!

1531
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:29,890
Am I gonna die?

1532
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:32,290
When's the last time I saved?

1533
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:37,350
Oh, flashing lights!

1534
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:40,970
Hello!

1535
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:59,190
Oh, I'm playing.

1536
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:02,770
One...

1537
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:22,730
Let's check out eight, nine and ten.

1538
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:49,770
Eight A.

1539
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:55,790
Oh, what the hell is that?

1540
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:00,690
What did it say?

1541
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:02,170
Follow me tonight?

1542
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:06,630
Oh, that's our friend!

1543
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:11,930
Our sister Tiffany has gone against the will of the Unspeakable.

1544
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:15,170
I thought I could trust her, but I was wrong.

1545
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:17,170
Proceed with the original plan.

1546
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:19,750
The woman in 5A will be our vessel.

1547
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:22,990
Let her pious friend come to rescue her.

1548
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:25,890
The Unspeakable shall crush them both.

1549
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:29,730
Oh my gosh.

1550
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:33,630
Okay.

1551
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:40,370
Friend!

1552
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:47,480
I don't know if he is a real friend.

1553
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:48,780
I don't think so.

1554
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:50,360
It's a scary game.

1555
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:51,380
Scary!

1556
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:57,800
Those who keep knocking on forbidden doors will be visited by the one who guards them.

1557
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,080
What did that mean?

1558
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:04,920
There is a seventh floor.

1559
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:14,250
What?

1560
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:29,710
That was so close.

1561
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:30,670
Holy moly.

1562
01:26:30,730 --> 01:26:31,810
Does he die eventually?

1563
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:32,970
Why?

1564
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:38,350
Oh my god.

1565
01:26:38,530 --> 01:26:39,870
That was so close.

1566
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:42,990
You guys, that was terrifying.

1567
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:45,410
Is he in here too?

1568
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:50,090
These are stairs.

1569
01:26:50,190 --> 01:26:51,070
You can't be in here.

1570
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:53,510
Or else I'll get scared.

1571
01:26:56,610 --> 01:26:57,810
Where is he gonna come from?

1572
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:00,610
Okay.

1573
01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:04,270
Taco!

1574
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:06,650
Welcome to Mambu Ship.

1575
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:07,350
Thank you!

1576
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:11,170
In here?

1577
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:12,290
Where are you?

1578
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:13,390
Friend?

1579
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:15,110
Friend!

1580
01:27:17,490 --> 01:27:18,110
Friend.

1581
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:24,250
There is like this one haunted house...

1582
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:26,250
at Fuji-Q Highlands.

1583
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:30,290
It's like an hour... They say it's an hour long and they are not kidding.

1584
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:33,150
It's an actual hour long haunted house.

1585
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:34,870
Oh my gosh!

1586
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:35,350
Pumpkin!

1587
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:38,510
And you have to go...

1588
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:41,550
Oh, haunted pumpkin.

1589
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:44,530
You have to go up and down stairs and stuff.

1590
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:53,410
When I went, I went with some friends and we were just like...

1591
01:27:53,410 --> 01:27:57,470
The staircase is the safe point because they can't scare you...

1592
01:27:57,470 --> 01:28:01,070
when you are going up or down the stairs because that's just dangerous.

1593
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:03,750
So...

1594
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:05,190
Really?

1595
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:05,890
A full hour long?

1596
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:06,790
Yes, actually!

1597
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:08,550
It's very long.

1598
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:11,150
It's very fun.

1599
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:20,680
Williams Family Newsletter, October 1987.

1600
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:27,860
If you are reading this, it means you have been invited to the Williams Family Annual Halloween Block Party!

1601
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:32,860
It will be held on Halloween starting at 5PM in Apartment 9B.

1602
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,860
Activities will start promptly, so please do not be late.

1603
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:41,340
If you plan on bringing a plus one, please let me know in advance.

1604
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:45,820
Only friends and family, aka those who received this newsletter, are invited.

1605
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:48,860
Selective.

1606
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:56,260
Also, just a reminder that this is a family friendly event, so please leave all overly scary costumes and masks at home.

1607
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:59,600
Timmy is still traumatized after last year's incident.

1608
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:01,940
We can tell.

1609
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:08,060
Also, I respectfully ask that you keep alcohol and cigarettes out of the apartment.

1610
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:16,560
Also, oh my goodness, we do not want a repeat of last year with the power going out, so please bring treats, but no tricks.

1611
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:24,060
And just another friendly reminder that anti-religious or satanic imagery will not be allowed in the apartment.

1612
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:29,080
Also, please be aware of Timmy's diet and food allergies.

1613
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:36,200
And please be aware he suffers from asthma, so please do not sneak up on him or try to scare him.

1614
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:40,240
Again, he still has trouble after what happened last year.

1615
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:41,900
There's so much to this.

1616
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,400
Oh my gosh.

1617
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,760
You will also notice he has a new imaginary friend.

1618
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,160
When you see him, please just roll with it.

1619
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,040
Timmy's therapist says it's healthy for him to have such a coping mechanism.

1620
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:55,600
God damn, Debbie!

1621
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:57,600
See you all at the party!

1622
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:04,080
Can't wait for you all to meet Mr. Miller, who has taken to Timmy so well and has become like a part of the family.

1623
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:04,700
Debbie.

1624
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:10,570
Is my friend not gonna show up?

1625
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:14,130
Friend?

1626
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:15,950
Not on the stairs, please.

1627
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:17,490
Not on the stairs, please.

1628
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:21,720
Friend?

1629
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:25,360
Oh, these ones don't have numbers.

1630
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:28,880
Master Miller.

1631
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:35,670
I can't understand.

1632
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:38,330
Follow me to... I can't understand what he's saying.

1633
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:41,530
What is this?

1634
01:30:41,890 --> 01:30:43,070
M for Master Miller.

1635
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:46,510
What's that sound?

1636
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,240
Sacrifice what you claim to.

1637
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:55,660
Oh my god!

1638
01:30:58,540 --> 01:30:59,580
Oh, why is it save?

1639
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:03,340
Basement dumbwaiter.

1640
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,200
How to use.

1641
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,540
Pull up on handle to open hatch.

1642
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:12,280
Place item or being to be sacrificed inside the container.

1643
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,380
Pull down on handle to close hatch.

1644
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,020
Press button to send dumbwaiter to basement.

1645
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,520
Light will blink red if done successfully.

1646
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:24,460
Please make sure your sacrifice does not jostle around inside the container.

1647
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:29,060
Do I have to send my cross down?

1648
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:30,720
No, no, no.

1649
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:31,760
It says what I cling to.

1650
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,100
I cling to my cross.

1651
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:37,020
Do not open hatch once dumbwaiter has reached the basement.

1652
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:40,980
I do not have enough earplugs and I am tired of people losing them.

1653
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:44,160
Please wait for the green light to come on before using.

1654
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:48,300
But how am I supposed to then kill my friend?

1655
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:51,220
Oh my god.

1656
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,000
Five Nights at Freddy's.

1657
01:31:59,060 --> 01:31:59,860
What do I do?

1658
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:02,560
Kill him first.

1659
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:05,720
Maybe I can.

1660
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:10,540
Maybe.

1661
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,780
He is really fast.

1662
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:16,260
I don't think I will be able to outrun him.

1663
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,060
We know he is...

1664
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,360
Oh gosh.

1665
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:23,380
Oh gosh.

1666
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:32,920
Maybe I can just use the elevator and go all the way to the first floor.

1667
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:36,100
Oh wait.

1668
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:36,600
Hello?

1669
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:38,860
Wait.

1670
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:39,920
Oh my god.

1671
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,840
That was so close.

1672
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,380
I got him.

1673
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:46,340
Oh my gosh.

1674
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,980
Time to play elevator game.

1675
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:49,540
Wait.

1676
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:50,080
Oh no.

1677
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,000
That's why I couldn't go inside.

1678
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:01,160
2, 10, 5, 1.

1679
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:06,720
Timmy?

1680
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:09,680
Is that what I put in?

1681
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:10,860
2, 10, 5, 1?

1682
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:17,910
Save Lisa before doing this.

1683
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:21,490
Wait.

1684
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:22,370
Do what first?

1685
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:24,770
What should I do first?

1686
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:26,810
The elevator game or the...

1687
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:31,430
Or the...

1688
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:35,310
The cross thing.

1689
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:38,810
Main first then elevator.

1690
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:39,070
Ok.

1691
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:45,530
I don't want to give up my prize.

1692
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:50,940
I don't want to give it up.

1693
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:53,660
Oh gosh.

1694
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,280
Goodbye cross.

1695
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:07,880
What did it say?

1696
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:09,600
I have to wait until the green light, right?

1697
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:11,520
What is that?

1698
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:12,700
Why is it bloody?

1699
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:17,000
Why is it bloody?

1700
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:21,040
Oh gosh.

1701
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:23,800
Ok.

1702
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:25,680
Hold on.

1703
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:26,640
I'm reading the note.

1704
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:27,560
What does it say again?

1705
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,260
Do not open hatch.

1706
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,660
How do I go?

1707
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,200
I guess I go.

1708
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,220
Oh gosh.

1709
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,320
Party, party!

1710
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,640
I don't have...

1711
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:59,620
First floor I guess.

1712
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:05,640
No, not the funky music.

1713
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,600
Play that funky music elevator.

1714
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:13,280
Oh no!

1715
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:14,560
Who are you?

1716
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:18,600
Oh shoot.

1717
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:26,030
Oh you just gonna...

1718
01:35:27,070 --> 01:35:28,570
Gary lied to us.

1719
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:32,650
When you see it, run.

1720
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,300
Which way do I go?

1721
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,160
Camera!

1722
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,860
Oh my god, no.

1723
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:56,420
I'm gonna...

1724
01:35:57,660 --> 01:36:00,080
I'm gonna lose my marbles in here.

1725
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,080
Too scary!

1726
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:12,730
I hate segments like this man.

1727
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:18,130
3B?

1728
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:22,290
I think I go in here instead.

1729
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,420
Oh gosh, I can't see in here at all.

1730
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:30,560
I didn't see anything.

1731
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,180
What is this?

1732
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:36,220
Oh, over here.

1733
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:40,460
Oh, I'm stuck by a wall.

1734
01:36:44,430 --> 01:36:45,970
I didn't see anything.

1735
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,680
I died.

1736
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,080
Think they were...

1737
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:02,780
Think they were faster than I do, than I am.

1738
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,280
Don't take photos there.

1739
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:07,360
I learned that part.

1740
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,120
Oh, it takes us right back to here though.

1741
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:11,180
Ok.

1742
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:15,400
I wish it recharged a little.

1743
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:18,280
Those symbols were not there before I think.

1744
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,360
Oh my gosh.

1745
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,680
Oh gosh, run, run, run, run, run.

1746
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:37,040
We were in the attic.

1747
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:42,300
Oh my gosh.

1748
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:43,800
I don't know where... Oh my god.

1749
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:46,660
Was that a person down there?

1750
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:49,820
I'm gonna die.

1751
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:50,800
I'm about to die.

1752
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:51,960
Oh, maybe not.

1753
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:53,860
Ok, we are out.

1754
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:01,830
I'm so sorry for anybody with flash issues.

1755
01:38:04,690 --> 01:38:06,610
Ok, I go into another room.

1756
01:38:07,850 --> 01:38:09,970
I love... Oh no, no, no, no.

1757
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:13,410
Wait, I didn't see...

1758
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:16,970
Wait, do I grab the dagger?

1759
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:19,470
No?

1760
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:21,190
Oh, probably the table.

1761
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:22,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1762
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:24,330
Ok.

1763
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:26,150
Ok.

1764
01:38:29,410 --> 01:38:31,430
We are going, we are going.

1765
01:38:32,930 --> 01:38:34,290
Oh gosh!

1766
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:41,540
She is naked!

1767
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,780
You guys, I'm trying to go...

1768
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:45,520
Mother.

1769
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,520
I'm going!

1770
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:52,540
Oh my god, where is she going?

1771
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:56,140
No!

1772
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:00,120
This is evil!

1773
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:07,030
Oh my god, I went too far.

1774
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:09,290
Shoot.

1775
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:11,670
I can't see anything.

1776
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:12,850
Oh, this way.

1777
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:15,190
Butter.

1778
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:15,370
Butter.

1779
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:19,710
Alright, down the stairs.

1780
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:23,510
Oh my gosh, I'm bleeding, why?

1781
01:39:26,270 --> 01:39:27,550
Or I stepped in blood?

1782
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:30,050
Ok, keep going.

1783
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:32,490
Gosh, this is a really long segment.

1784
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:35,230
For like this kind of... What's the word?

1785
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:37,410
Oh no!

1786
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:40,190
For this type of...

1787
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:44,010
Thing you have to do, you know.

1788
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:49,010
Yeah, gimmick, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1789
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:53,270
Mechanic, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1790
01:39:53,390 --> 01:39:54,430
It's a very long section.

1791
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:57,370
Ok.

1792
01:40:00,010 --> 01:40:02,110
I didn't remember how long it was before.

1793
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:03,790
Oh my god, oh my god!

1794
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:19,260
Oh, it saved!

1795
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:20,420
Oh, thank goodness.

1796
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:21,860
What is this?

1797
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:26,880
Why couldn't I see with all these candles lit, huh?

1798
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:29,240
Oh my goodness.

1799
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:36,720
Why was my cross all the way over there anyway?

1800
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:39,980
Go right?

1801
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:41,180
Right here?

1802
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:43,380
Fake candles.

1803
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:44,520
Oh, I can go to the right.

1804
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:50,760
What happens if we sprinkle salt on you?

1805
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:52,920
It's like a snail, you know.

1806
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:55,680
Hold on, let me get the note first.

1807
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:56,580
Oh wait, what is this?

1808
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:57,800
Hold on, let's get this first.

1809
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:06,800
The seal!

1810
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:11,300
Ok, saved.

1811
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:12,080
Very good.

1812
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:14,600
My beloved Gary.

1813
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:18,060
Alas, the mask is already stained with blood.

1814
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:19,460
My blood.

1815
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:21,160
The ritual is complete.

1816
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:25,400
You will not find me on this mortal plane, for I am beyond!

1817
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:32,040
Look for me in the unseen world if you dare.

1818
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:32,980
Tiffany.

1819
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:35,140
Tiffany is... Tiffany is...

1820
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:38,240
She just kind of took her own route with this, huh?

1821
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:41,740
She was like, Tiffany, you're a little freaky.

1822
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,200
Not seven.

1823
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:47,480
Wait, what does that mean?

1824
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:53,180
Seventy times seven.

1825
01:42:04,850 --> 01:42:06,250
Seventy times seven?

1826
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:10,410
490.

1827
01:42:12,230 --> 01:42:15,370
Oh, Sister Minto, I must confess a most grievous sin.

1828
01:42:15,510 --> 01:42:18,850
I hath been watching other girls by the name of Maid Lilac and Maid Turquoise.

1829
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:19,850
Can I be saved?

1830
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:25,870
You are very brave for admitting that.

1831
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:29,930
Oh god.

1832
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:34,690
I know your secret.

1833
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:37,590
Where are you?

1834
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:41,670
Can I still get you Arthur?

1835
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:49,830
You can't hide anymore.

1836
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:51,290
Betrayer!

1837
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:53,330
Thanks for the five guten!

1838
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:55,110
Oh my gosh.

1839
01:42:56,990 --> 01:42:58,150
You sneaky.

1840
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:08,900
Thank you so much for the five guten!

1841
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:11,900
You belong to her.

1842
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:14,980
Uh oh, leaky.

1843
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:17,620
I can fix it.

1844
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:19,460
I am the fix it priest.

1845
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,780
I can fix anything.

1846
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:27,510
Harbing Mint.

1847
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:33,870
You belong to me.

1848
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:35,710
You belong...

1849
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:36,630
To me!

1850
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:47,220
Oh, I didn't mean to skip that.

1851
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:48,140
Hopefully I didn't.

1852
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,200
Wood.

1853
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:57,900
Oh my god.

1854
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:59,440
I'm a little zombie man.

1855
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:00,820
Don't fall down the stairs.

1856
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:02,500
Be careful.

1857
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:03,080
Oh my god.

1858
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:05,380
I think I'm possessed.

1859
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:10,740
Oh, I'm saved.

1860
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:15,720
I think I'm possessed.

1861
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:17,660
And I saved the game.

1862
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:19,220
I should leave.

1863
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:34,820
We gotta save Lisa.

1864
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:37,700
What floor was she on again?

1865
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:39,040
The door?

1866
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:40,060
Oh, five, right?

1867
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:46,660
Oops.

1868
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:54,800
Well, we save Lisa and then we do the elevator, right?

1869
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:57,320
What happened to...

1870
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:59,680
This happened to my buddy Dave the other day.

1871
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:00,480
Is Dave okay?

1872
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:02,900
Try to save Lisa for the best ending.

1873
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:03,540
Okay.

1874
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,000
I can go downstairs.

1875
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:09,240
Downstairs is this way.

1876
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:15,680
You're tearing me apart, Lisa.

1877
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:21,300
Oh, just kidding.

1878
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:21,880
Other way.

1879
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:26,920
Probably would have been faster to take the elevator.

1880
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:31,990
You're tearing me... You know what?

1881
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:32,410
I'm here.

1882
01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:33,410
Let's just take the elevator.

1883
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:36,090
I've gotten enough exercise.

1884
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:40,030
These demons have made me work for it for real, you know?

1885
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:44,190
They have made me work for it.

1886
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:48,850
Do you dislike elevators?

1887
01:45:48,970 --> 01:45:50,690
I've gotten stuck in an elevator before.

1888
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:51,370
Have you not?

1889
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:55,590
I still remember the longest I got stuck in one, though.

1890
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:00,440
Oh no, it's open.

1891
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:00,640
It's open.

1892
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:06,360
If you fail to save Lisa, just click quit to the menu and try again.

1893
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:06,680
Okay.

1894
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:15,720
Kept you waiting, huh?

1895
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:24,040
I really didn't, actually.

1896
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,440
I took quite a...

1897
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,120
I took quite a few detours.

1898
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:31,040
Oh god.

1899
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:33,460
Lisa!

1900
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:35,740
Lisa, no!

1901
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:39,880
I'm not Lisa.

1902
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:41,220
Lisa!

1903
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:42,940
I don't want to hurt you, Lisa.

1904
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:44,900
Look at her go.

1905
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:47,420
See that girl?

1906
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:49,680
Watch that queen!

1907
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,740
Digging the dancing queen!

1908
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:52,340
Queen!

1909
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:56,940
I think I got him.

1910
01:46:57,640 --> 01:46:58,400
Oh my god.

1911
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:00,020
He's back in Lisa.

1912
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,160
See that girl?

1913
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,600
Watch that queen.

1914
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,160
Digging the dancing queen!

1915
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,540
Oh my goodness.

1916
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:12,380
Which one is it?

1917
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:14,680
You?

1918
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:15,340
Oh my god.

1919
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:18,960
I can save you, Lisa!

1920
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:19,660
Oh my god.

1921
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:20,380
Oh my gosh.

1922
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:25,000
I don't know if I'm doing this correctly.

1923
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:27,220
Hold on, Lisa.

1924
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:28,280
Get away from me.

1925
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:30,480
Luckily she's a little slow.

1926
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:33,740
Lisa also takes the elevator.

1927
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:37,980
Oh my goodness.

1928
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:39,580
Is it?

1929
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:48,150
You're doing it right?

1930
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:48,650
Okay, cool.

1931
01:47:48,850 --> 01:47:49,210
Thank you.

1932
01:47:51,650 --> 01:47:54,450
She's really going now.

1933
01:47:55,310 --> 01:47:56,990
It's so funny watching her.

1934
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:59,510
Oh, I've been...

1935
01:48:07,870 --> 01:48:09,550
Fight it, John!

1936
01:48:27,550 --> 01:48:28,710
Restart.

1937
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:32,570
That's so scary though!

1938
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:38,230
I was doing so well!

1939
01:48:45,290 --> 01:48:49,010
I can't believe I got so lucky on the first couple ones.

1940
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:50,770
Can she touch me?

1941
01:48:54,210 --> 01:48:54,890
No,

1942
01:48:59,210 --> 01:49:00,330
I actually...

1943
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:03,590
I was just guessing.

1944
01:49:03,710 --> 01:49:05,270
I was just guessing for all of them.

1945
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:08,270
I didn't know that he was going into a specific one.

1946
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:09,510
To be honest.

1947
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:14,840
Oh goodness, Lisa.

1948
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:15,440
Okay.

1949
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,340
She's got that spicy touch.

1950
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:20,140
There's a way to tell?

1951
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:21,960
Wait, how is it?

1952
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:24,400
How do you tell?

1953
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:27,780
Oh my goodness!

1954
01:49:38,450 --> 01:49:39,550
Watch the eyes.

1955
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:43,030
I'm sorry guys.

1956
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:45,050
I'm sorry.

1957
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:51,890
When I get possessed, I guess I have... I tried pressing space, but I guess that didn't work.

1958
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:53,210
Unless I didn't do it enough.

1959
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:54,530
Begin.

1960
01:50:00,830 --> 01:50:01,350
Lisa.

1961
01:50:02,690 --> 01:50:03,990
Okay, so the eyes.

1962
01:50:04,610 --> 01:50:05,130
Okay.

1963
01:50:06,150 --> 01:50:06,970
Good to know.

1964
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:09,930
The way he sounds is so disingenuous.

1965
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:10,390
Lisa.

1966
01:50:13,270 --> 01:50:14,730
I'm so sorry.

1967
01:50:16,930 --> 01:50:18,390
I can't believe I got so lucky.

1968
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:21,530
Wait, these don't have eyes.

1969
01:50:22,530 --> 01:50:23,050
Oh shoot.

1970
01:50:23,930 --> 01:50:27,350
Oh, hold space.

1971
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:30,190
I'm fighting it!

1972
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:33,710
I'm fighting it!

1973
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:34,510
Okay.

1974
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:41,290
The demon's eyes, not the little mothman's eyes.

1975
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:44,490
I thought they grew eyes.

1976
01:50:45,690 --> 01:50:46,370
Oh goodness.

1977
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:47,510
It's okay.

1978
01:50:47,610 --> 01:50:50,710
Dang, I got so far and then...

1979
01:50:51,450 --> 01:50:52,730
Oh, I think it's the top one.

1980
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:54,430
What?

1981
01:50:56,050 --> 01:50:56,650
What?

1982
01:51:06,020 --> 01:51:07,520
I'm not very good at this.

1983
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:13,420
I wish I hadn't died the first round.

1984
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,420
Because I did so well.

1985
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:20,680
Oh, this one.

1986
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,680
How did I get so lucky before?

1987
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:33,380
I think I'm a secret genius.

1988
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:40,240
Oh, I couldn't tell.

1989
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:41,260
I couldn't tell!

1990
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:42,000
Oh gosh, this one?

1991
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:43,500
No, this one?

1992
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:45,220
Oh shoot!

1993
01:51:58,240 --> 01:51:59,700
I'm sick of this.

1994
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,380
I'm sick of this.

1995
01:52:05,690 --> 01:52:07,410
Oh no, Lisa.

1996
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:10,810
I'm not Lisa!

1997
01:52:12,590 --> 01:52:13,710
Shut up!

1998
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:22,690
The devil made me do it.

1999
01:52:24,290 --> 01:52:24,890
Okay.

2000
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:27,750
Oh, that one was obvious.

2001
01:52:32,410 --> 01:52:33,430
Oh my goodness!

2002
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:34,270
Okay.

2003
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:36,850
He was getting awfully close to me.

2004
01:52:38,110 --> 01:52:39,490
Alright Lisa, we'll save you.

2005
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:41,710
We'll save you.

2006
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:43,590
We'll save you.

2007
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:44,310
Okay.

2008
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:48,410
Top one?

2009
01:52:49,190 --> 01:52:50,630
No, bottom right?

2010
01:53:00,990 --> 01:53:03,610
When it splits one of them goes faster.

2011
01:53:04,450 --> 01:53:05,570
I see.

2012
01:53:06,430 --> 01:53:11,590
I can't get over how much is really just going crazy.

2013
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:13,270
The bottom right.

2014
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:16,870
Oh my goodness.

2015
01:53:17,450 --> 01:53:18,410
I didn't give enough space.

2016
01:53:18,410 --> 01:53:20,690
Uh-oh.

2017
01:53:22,950 --> 01:53:24,110
What the...what?

2018
01:53:24,570 --> 01:53:25,610
This is so unfair!

2019
01:53:29,170 --> 01:53:30,950
This is so unfair!

2020
01:53:36,710 --> 01:53:45,570
I'd rather her kill me than me killing her and then having to start all over and go to the main menu and everything.

2021
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:52,000
This one.

2022
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:04,680
Okay.

2023
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:08,240
Back into there.

2024
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:08,600
Okay.

2025
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:12,460
Oh my God!

2026
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:13,400
Don't get close to me Lisa!

2027
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:14,180
Lisa!

2028
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:14,840
Lisa!

2029
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:15,480
Stay away from me!

2030
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:16,780
Lisa!

2031
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:19,100
Stay away from me Lisa!

2032
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:20,440
Lisa!

2033
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:25,360
I'm not Lisa!

2034
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:29,620
Oh shoot!

2035
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:30,260
I don't know.

2036
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:31,700
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

2037
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:32,000
This one?

2038
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:33,000
No!

2039
01:54:33,180 --> 01:54:33,400
Shoot!

2040
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:34,300
I don't know.

2041
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:35,320
No!

2042
01:54:48,650 --> 01:54:49,210
Man,

2043
01:54:53,710 --> 01:54:55,690
this is so frustrating!

2044
01:54:58,150 --> 01:54:59,650
Did you hit the wrong button?

2045
01:54:59,790 --> 01:55:01,530
No, I was holding down space!

2046
01:55:01,990 --> 01:55:03,090
I was!

2047
01:55:03,530 --> 01:55:04,950
He didn't fight at all!

2048
01:55:05,410 --> 01:55:07,070
This guy is so weak!

2049
01:55:07,870 --> 01:55:08,890
John sucks!

2050
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:12,290
John Faith, I hate you!

2051
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:17,710
You got to mash it.

2052
01:55:20,770 --> 01:55:23,530
I'm tearing you apart Lisa.

2053
01:55:23,530 --> 01:55:29,250
And then sometimes I can't tell which guy goes the fastest or whatever, whatever.

2054
01:55:29,710 --> 01:55:30,350
Goodness.

2055
01:55:32,450 --> 01:55:34,010
I think he's in the top.

2056
01:55:35,490 --> 01:55:35,650
No!

2057
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:39,730
Come on!

2058
01:55:43,570 --> 01:55:44,590
I'm button mashing!

2059
01:55:44,910 --> 01:55:45,970
I'm button mashing!

2060
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:48,710
It's not working!

2061
01:55:49,190 --> 01:55:49,670
Oh my God.

2062
01:55:55,470 --> 01:55:57,250
We're going to be here forever you guys.

2063
01:55:58,250 --> 01:55:59,490
We're going to be here forever.

2064
01:56:02,770 --> 01:56:04,070
Shut up please!

2065
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:06,110
I don't want to hear it anymore!

2066
01:56:07,630 --> 01:56:09,990
I don't want to hear it anymore Lisa!

2067
01:56:10,110 --> 01:56:12,270
You're tearing me apart Lisa!

2068
01:56:13,650 --> 01:56:15,930
You're tearing me apart Lisa!

2069
01:56:17,470 --> 01:56:19,290
Oh my gosh, get her.

2070
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:21,430
Thank you for the five gifted.

2071
01:56:21,670 --> 01:56:22,210
I see it.

2072
01:56:27,890 --> 01:56:28,690
Oh my God.

2073
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:34,110
Hold on, I got to get a good distance away from her.

2074
01:56:35,010 --> 01:56:35,590
If I can.

2075
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:37,830
Oh my goodness.

2076
01:56:52,730 --> 01:56:56,270
Alright, Lisa!

2077
01:56:57,470 --> 01:56:57,890
Lisa!

2078
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:02,890
Was it the bottom left?

2079
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:08,850
He's getting faster.

2080
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:24,520
Lisa, stay away from me!

2081
01:57:32,530 --> 01:57:33,670
Oh, she's good.

2082
01:57:35,190 --> 01:57:40,830
John's crucifix changes from gold to silver to bronze to symbolize his declining faith during the chapters.

2083
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:41,990
You did great, I have faith in you.

2084
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:42,590
Thanks villain!

2085
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:45,090
No, that is not Lisa.

2086
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:46,790
Lisa!

2087
01:57:49,650 --> 01:57:51,130
Oh my gosh, she's hot!

2088
01:57:51,130 --> 01:57:56,390
Thanks John, I'm not like how you told me off.

2089
01:57:56,930 --> 01:58:00,490
Listen, John, the bad man, Gary Miller.

2090
01:58:00,990 --> 01:58:01,910
Gary Miller?

2091
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:06,230
Nor the granny.

2092
01:58:08,890 --> 01:58:12,070
Do you need a place to stay?

2093
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:15,030
I'll be fine.

2094
01:58:15,390 --> 01:58:16,370
You can go in.

2095
01:58:16,450 --> 01:58:17,570
I don't think you will.

2096
01:58:17,570 --> 01:58:20,510
Your door is...

2097
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:21,550
I don't think you will.

2098
01:58:21,930 --> 01:58:23,390
You have blood everywhere.

2099
01:58:26,170 --> 01:58:27,090
Oh my gosh.

2100
01:58:27,670 --> 01:58:30,330
We tried to have Riz and she rejected us.

2101
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:32,050
Smooth one, John.

2102
01:58:32,950 --> 01:58:35,670
You want to come to my place, Lisa?

2103
01:58:37,630 --> 01:58:41,250
I sense another demonic seal was broken somewhere beyond.

2104
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:42,310
Wait!

2105
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:42,590
Wait!

2106
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:46,010
Is that the one that...

2107
01:58:46,010 --> 01:58:48,390
Is that the one that we're working on?

2108
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:54,460
1, 4, 2, 6... Wait.

2109
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:56,480
Hold on, I need to look at the notes.

2110
01:58:57,700 --> 01:58:58,180
Ok.

2111
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,120
Alright guys, let's remember.

2112
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:01,940
It's...

2113
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:02,620
This one first.

2114
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:04,200
1, 4, 2, 6...

2115
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:06,160
1, 4, 2, 6...

2116
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:09,260
2...

2117
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:11,540
10, 5, 1... I can't remember.

2118
01:59:11,540 --> 01:59:13,380
Hold on, let me write it down.

2119
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,020
1, 4, 2, 6...

2120
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:21,540
2, 10, 5, 1...

2121
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:25,120
Ok, I wrote it down.

2122
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:28,180
I wrote it down, I wrote it down.

2123
01:59:37,540 --> 01:59:38,000
1...

2124
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,060
This is going to take forever.

2125
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:40,860
Ignore the granny.

2126
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:41,780
Who's the granny?

2127
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:46,360
Stop putting random numbers in the chat!

2128
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:49,740
Memoirai.

2129
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:52,820
4...

2130
01:59:52,820 --> 01:59:57,820
I mostly write it so that people who write the wrong thing can't confuse me.

2131
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:09,620
2...

2132
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,720
The granny insta-kills you.

2133
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:16,080
Wait, what are you guys talking about?

2134
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:18,800
6...

2135
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:21,440
I need scissors.

2136
02:00:21,580 --> 02:00:22,060
61.

2137
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:25,400
6...

2138
02:00:30,510 --> 02:00:32,690
It's based on Korean urban legend.

2139
02:00:33,290 --> 02:00:39,270
It said that an old lady might get on with you on the first floor and that you should not acknowledge it.

2140
02:00:43,730 --> 02:00:44,250
2...

2141
02:00:44,250 --> 02:00:46,350
The Riz wouldn't work because Lisa is his sister.

2142
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:47,110
What?

2143
02:00:47,110 --> 02:00:47,310
What?

2144
02:00:52,090 --> 02:00:54,070
We're in Connecticut, not Alabama.

2145
02:00:55,370 --> 02:00:55,990
10.

2146
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:57,770
Oh my gosh, from 2 to 10?

2147
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:10,220
That is removed lore.

2148
02:01:18,150 --> 02:01:18,770
5...

2149
02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:35,030
5...

2150
02:01:43,230 --> 02:01:43,730
5...

2151
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:45,550
1...

2152
02:02:01,130 --> 02:02:02,500
Do I just stand here?

2153
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:18,300
Wait, no.

2154
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:20,100
No, I want to get out of this.

2155
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:23,160
Wait, we're on 10.

2156
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:25,660
How do we get to 10?

2157
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:26,580
10...

2158
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:35,020
Wait, I'm confused.

2159
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:39,460
Wait, I thought we were on 1.

2160
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:46,780
No, how did I mess up?

2161
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:50,140
How did I mess up?

2162
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:56,200
I tried to walk out, but literally I was too close to this and it triggered it.

2163
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:59,320
And then you can't... I didn't see what floor I was on.

2164
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:01,400
That's why...

2165
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:03,940
That's why... Okay, I'll try it again.

2166
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:04,660
I'll try it again.

2167
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:05,160
Sorry.

2168
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:19,120
2...

2169
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:22,660
Sorry, guys.

2170
02:03:28,340 --> 02:03:29,140
2... 6...

2171
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:31,800
6...

2172
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:33,420
I do want to see it, though.

2173
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:36,160
Just gotta...

2174
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:39,060
6...

2175
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:48,100
2...

2176
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:49,340
No, not 7.

2177
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:50,000
5.

2178
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:52,480
MacCabbage, you're wrong!

2179
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:57,400
MacCabbage, it's... I mean, it's not 5!

2180
02:03:57,520 --> 02:03:58,240
No, it's 7!

2181
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:03,000
10...

2182
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:05,500
5 and then 1.

2183
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:08,900
I have ketchup.

2184
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:11,300
Not on my forehead.

2185
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:12,160
That'd be silly.

2186
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:18,540
It's 7.

2187
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:19,160
You said it.

2188
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:20,060
No, I didn't!

2189
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:23,900
It's 10... 5...

2190
02:04:28,010 --> 02:04:29,810
And then the lady will show up here, right?

2191
02:04:32,650 --> 02:04:34,150
Or does she show up at 1?

2192
02:04:38,950 --> 02:04:39,670
1...

2193
02:04:39,670 --> 02:04:40,730
She shows up here.

2194
02:04:41,490 --> 02:04:41,950
Okay.

2195
02:04:43,290 --> 02:04:45,150
So now I go to...

2196
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:50,800
1.

2197
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:53,180
Definitely 1.

2198
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:00,800
Did I accidentally press 10 before?

2199
02:05:03,980 --> 02:05:05,940
I think you hit 1.

2200
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:06,300
See?

2201
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:07,620
I hit 1!

2202
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:10,400
But it went...

2203
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:11,700
Yes I did!

2204
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:14,700
Oh, she said where are you going.

2205
02:05:15,380 --> 02:05:16,640
I'm leaving grandma.

2206
02:05:23,910 --> 02:05:25,590
Do I just have to ignore her?

2207
02:05:28,990 --> 02:05:29,550
Timmy!

2208
02:05:30,070 --> 02:05:31,110
Oh my god, Timmy.

2209
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:36,730
Timmy and his friend.

2210
02:05:37,570 --> 02:05:38,490
But I killed the friend.

2211
02:05:41,890 --> 02:05:42,450
Timmy?

2212
02:05:46,110 --> 02:05:47,230
Are they in here?

2213
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:52,160
Timmy?

2214
02:05:52,340 --> 02:05:53,340
Oh my gosh, it just saved.

2215
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:54,560
Actually, good.

2216
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:55,680
Timmy?

2217
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:58,240
Timmy!

2218
02:05:59,340 --> 02:05:59,980
Timmy!

2219
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:00,820
Timmy?

2220
02:06:02,620 --> 02:06:03,260
Hot!

2221
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:04,460
Damn!

2222
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:07,860
Oh my gosh, I love a dolly hand.

2223
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:09,760
Finally!

2224
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:11,500
For me?

2225
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:12,660
Oh my gosh!

2226
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:21,620
Tiffany.

2227
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:29,660
How do you not know who Gary is yet?

2228
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:42,960
She's threatening me with a good time.

2229
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:52,180
Get you a girl like Tiffany.

2230
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:54,440
Now?

2231
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:21,800
Oh shoot!

2232
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:22,980
Oh my god.

2233
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:28,480
How big is this room?

2234
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:30,380
Oh, it's actually quite massive.

2235
02:07:34,180 --> 02:07:36,340
I don't think I can get touched by those.

2236
02:07:47,940 --> 02:07:49,760
I wouldn't let you go, girl.

2237
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:52,180
Oh my gosh.

2238
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:54,760
Thank goodness you moved away from me.

2239
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,440
Another silent hill call out boss there.

2240
02:07:59,220 --> 02:07:59,660
Oh my gosh.

2241
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:06,840
I think we are OK.

2242
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:07,340
Nice.

2243
02:08:09,900 --> 02:08:11,480
Are you gonna start working?

2244
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:13,900
Why is the cross so weak?

2245
02:08:16,540 --> 02:08:20,100
Cross only works within certain inches.

2246
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:22,800
Oh my god.

2247
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:24,360
Please get away from me.

2248
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:25,840
Yeah, thank you.

2249
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:28,340
Oh my gosh.

2250
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:30,340
There we go.

2251
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:32,940
If I can just get a little bit in, please.

2252
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:33,640
Oh my god.

2253
02:08:37,060 --> 02:08:37,820
I'm gonna die.

2254
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:38,380
Oh my gosh.

2255
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:47,960
So close.

2256
02:08:48,060 --> 02:08:48,740
I know, right?

2257
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:49,660
Holy cow.

2258
02:08:58,750 --> 02:08:59,430
Oh my god.

2259
02:08:59,570 --> 02:08:59,950
Please.

2260
02:09:09,210 --> 02:09:11,030
Stop moving around so much, Tiffany.

2261
02:09:13,390 --> 02:09:14,190
Oh my god.

2262
02:09:14,270 --> 02:09:14,690
I'm gonna die.

2263
02:09:23,110 --> 02:09:25,330
The movement was unpredictable.

2264
02:09:26,290 --> 02:09:27,550
Dang, that was so close.

2265
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:36,300
DVD screensaver of demons.

2266
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:46,000
OK.

2267
02:09:46,840 --> 02:09:47,440
Yeah, yeah.

2268
02:09:47,540 --> 02:09:48,320
We get it, Tiffany.

2269
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:50,280
You're high, OK?

2270
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:52,660
Quit showing off.

2271
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:55,240
Oh my god.

2272
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:57,080
Can I please get a hit in?

2273
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:04,200
So I think it's if Tiffany touches me, not the...

2274
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:04,740
Oh my god.

2275
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:05,500
Oh my god.

2276
02:10:12,430 --> 02:10:15,430
Not the little spaghetti arms.

2277
02:10:16,310 --> 02:10:16,890
Oh my gosh.

2278
02:10:16,950 --> 02:10:17,210
Tiffany.

2279
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:17,570
Tiffany!

2280
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:24,880
Tiffany, Minto loves you.

2281
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:37,920
No, no, no, no.

2282
02:10:38,420 --> 02:10:39,240
Oh my god.

2283
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:42,820
I was facing the wrong direction.

2284
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:45,020
OK.

2285
02:10:45,180 --> 02:10:45,600
Oh my god.

2286
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:48,380
Run, run, run.

2287
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:53,700
She's tough.

2288
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:54,480
She's a toughie.

2289
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:55,640
She's a baddie.

2290
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:57,320
She's a badbie.

2291
02:10:57,480 --> 02:11:00,580
I mean she literally like beheaded herself for a man.

2292
02:11:00,580 --> 02:11:03,200
Tiffany, for a man?

2293
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:07,120
Tiffany, have higher standards.

2294
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:10,300
Carrie loves everybody, I guess.

2295
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:15,960
Tiffany, love yourself more.

2296
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:19,340
Tiffany.

2297
02:11:21,620 --> 02:11:22,400
Oh my god.

2298
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:23,800
Oh my god.

2299
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:24,640
Oh my god.

2300
02:11:24,740 --> 02:11:25,320
Oh my god.

2301
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:28,080
This is such a... This is the battle.

2302
02:11:28,260 --> 02:11:29,620
This is the...

2303
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:30,280
Oh my god.

2304
02:11:30,740 --> 02:11:31,820
Oh my god.

2305
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:32,800
Oh my god, please.

2306
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:35,140
Oh my god, I can't even get a hit in.

2307
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:39,960
Oh my god.

2308
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:41,000
Oh my god.

2309
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:41,240
What?

2310
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:44,320
No!

2311
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:54,400
We were so close.

2312
02:11:58,460 --> 02:12:00,280
Hold on, I was drinking my tea.

2313
02:12:00,280 --> 02:12:00,340
I was drinking my tea.

2314
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:14,200
I didn't... I thought it was like literally if like Tiffany's body...

2315
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:16,260
Got me, you know.

2316
02:12:17,780 --> 02:12:20,140
Not his little scrangly self.

2317
02:12:21,860 --> 02:12:25,020
But the hitbox is a little weird, I think.

2318
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:27,940
Oh my god, please.

2319
02:12:27,940 --> 02:12:28,280
No!

2320
02:12:31,240 --> 02:12:35,040
Because his body is also... So it's like really tall.

2321
02:12:36,340 --> 02:12:37,900
The top of her head got your foot.

2322
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:39,100
Oh my gosh.

2323
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:41,340
It's a bit bigger.

2324
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:44,360
Yeah, it's a bit bigger than just Tiffany, unfortunately.

2325
02:12:45,880 --> 02:12:49,380
I have to watch for like the middle of the scrangle man.

2326
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:51,900
That guy is dangerous.

2327
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:52,100
Yes.

2328
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:55,980
Oh my gosh.

2329
02:12:56,140 --> 02:12:56,880
Oh my gosh.

2330
02:12:57,060 --> 02:12:57,840
Oh my gosh, please.

2331
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:02,080
Please Tiffany.

2332
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:02,980
Oh my god.

2333
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:03,180
Ok.

2334
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:05,960
Tiffany.

2335
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:06,960
Tiffany.

2336
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:07,620
Tiffany.

2337
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:10,520
I don't like this boss.

2338
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:11,340
It's hard.

2339
02:13:12,660 --> 02:13:14,400
I'm not fast enough.

2340
02:13:15,780 --> 02:13:18,040
I'm not fast enough for Tiffany.

2341
02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:28,560
The music is kind of awesome though.

2342
02:13:31,420 --> 02:13:32,820
The music is awesome though.

2343
02:13:36,620 --> 02:13:37,420
Holy moly.

2344
02:13:44,830 --> 02:13:46,550
She is so hard.

2345
02:13:49,150 --> 02:13:49,770
Oh my god.

2346
02:13:49,870 --> 02:13:50,430
Oh my god.

2347
02:13:50,470 --> 02:13:50,790
Oh my god.

2348
02:13:50,830 --> 02:13:51,210
Oh my god.

2349
02:13:51,230 --> 02:13:51,670
Oh my god.

2350
02:13:51,750 --> 02:13:52,190
No, no, no!

2351
02:13:55,450 --> 02:13:56,210
Holy shit.

2352
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:02,320
Just gotta get in a little bit.

2353
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:03,700
Little bit.

2354
02:14:04,060 --> 02:14:04,880
If I can.

2355
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:10,640
Oh my god.

2356
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:11,160
Oh my god.

2357
02:14:20,780 --> 02:14:22,420
I don't like this boss.

2358
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:23,520
I don't like this boss.

2359
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:25,260
She is so tough.

2360
02:14:25,580 --> 02:14:26,700
She is so unpredictable.

2361
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:28,740
I don't... I like girls.

2362
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:29,340
Please.

2363
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:30,120
Tiffany.

2364
02:14:30,760 --> 02:14:31,120
Tiffany.

2365
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:33,100
Tiffany, you're not my type.

2366
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:36,560
I need a little more structure in my afterlife.

2367
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:36,840
Ok?

2368
02:14:37,460 --> 02:14:38,100
Please.

2369
02:14:44,920 --> 02:14:46,700
She didn't like hearing that.

2370
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:58,960
Take that Tiffany!

2371
02:15:02,700 --> 02:15:03,420
Thank you.

2372
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:11,940
I didn't even flinch that much.

2373
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:16,300
Well done priest.

2374
02:15:16,660 --> 02:15:20,700
You wasted another day aiding a worthless soul and you got rid of Tiffany for me.

2375
02:15:21,200 --> 02:15:23,060
Are you sure you know who's side you're on?

2376
02:15:23,420 --> 02:15:24,760
We'll find out soon enough.

2377
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:27,060
Remember, Gary loves you.

2378
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:32,440
She lets out 490 souls during the fight when she bounces around.

2379
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:33,340
Divided by 7.

2380
02:15:40,270 --> 02:15:43,110
Have we done everything?

2381
02:15:45,930 --> 02:15:47,110
Have we done everything?

2382
02:15:49,850 --> 02:15:50,950
Can I leave?

2383
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:53,890
Bum bum bum.

2384
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:57,400
Timmy.

2385
02:15:57,560 --> 02:15:58,340
Oh, Timmy.

2386
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:00,960
Oh my god, find Timmy.

2387
02:16:02,020 --> 02:16:02,280
Wait.

2388
02:16:02,660 --> 02:16:05,800
Did it just loop me?

2389
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:09,120
Why am I looping?

2390
02:16:09,180 --> 02:16:10,140
Whoa, what's happening?

2391
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:12,800
Why am I looping?

2392
02:16:14,440 --> 02:16:15,560
Go on the elevator?

2393
02:16:21,680 --> 02:16:22,920
Damnatio memory.

2394
02:16:28,700 --> 02:16:29,300
Huh?

2395
02:16:43,950 --> 02:16:45,950
I'm just gonna keep on going.

2396
02:17:00,130 --> 02:17:01,830
Oh, we're still in...

2397
02:17:01,830 --> 02:17:04,450
Why did it save again?

2398
02:17:09,640 --> 02:17:10,760
Seventh floor.

2399
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,540
We made it, finally.

2400
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:16,000
Oh, is this where Timmy's at?

2401
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:17,040
Timmy!

2402
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:19,280
Timmy!

2403
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:22,040
Timmy!

2404
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:32,300
You look like...

2405
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,060
You look like you need some help there, Timmy.

2406
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:35,600
Oh no!

2407
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:37,480
No, Timmy.

2408
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:41,340
He promised me so much.

2409
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:43,220
I just want to see my little boy again.

2410
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:45,680
The replacement is almost fully formed.

2411
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:47,780
Just a few more bodies.

2412
02:17:48,940 --> 02:17:52,200
I don't think Timmy's been around for a minute, you guys.

2413
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,960
I think Timmy has been gone.

2414
02:18:00,890 --> 02:18:03,970
I'm not gonna stick around to be one of the bodies.

2415
02:18:06,550 --> 02:18:09,150
Wait, do you think the elevator friend was Timmy?

2416
02:18:10,210 --> 02:18:11,070
Oh no!

2417
02:18:12,990 --> 02:18:14,850
Do you think maybe...

2418
02:18:19,700 --> 02:18:21,500
Do you think it was him?

2419
02:18:21,820 --> 02:18:22,860
That was elevator friend.

2420
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,500
Okay, my bad.

2421
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:26,920
Nah, that's a demon.

2422
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:34,540
Poor Timmy.

2423
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:38,600
Okay, well...

2424
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:43,240
I thought like maybe his imaginary friend manifested to become him, you know what I mean?

2425
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:48,260
Alright.

2426
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:53,180
Time to go home, I think.

2427
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:56,320
I think it's time to leave.

2428
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:58,580
Investigate the apartments.

2429
02:19:04,330 --> 02:19:05,390
Good job, Minto.

2430
02:19:05,590 --> 02:19:06,430
Thank you!

2431
02:19:12,640 --> 02:19:14,820
Okay, we just have one more!

2432
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:16,200
We just have one more!

2433
02:19:20,930 --> 02:19:22,630
Take it and save her.

2434
02:19:24,330 --> 02:19:25,710
Oh my gosh.

2435
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:28,070
Father, I don't remember your name.

2436
02:19:30,230 --> 02:19:30,830
Father...

2437
02:19:30,830 --> 02:19:32,730
Who the hell is that?

2438
02:19:33,730 --> 02:19:34,650
Excuse me?

2439
02:19:35,550 --> 02:19:36,090
Spooky?

2440
02:19:42,190 --> 02:19:42,730
Freaky!

2441
02:19:43,710 --> 02:19:44,770
Who are you?

2442
02:19:46,090 --> 02:19:46,950
In the corner.

2443
02:19:59,180 --> 02:20:00,560
I don't like her.

2444
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:01,360
I don't like her.

2445
02:20:01,420 --> 02:20:02,000
I don't like her.

2446
02:20:03,060 --> 02:20:04,240
I don't like her.

2447
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:04,960
I don't like her.

2448
02:20:09,900 --> 02:20:11,780
Mr. and Mrs. Martin!

2449
02:20:14,180 --> 02:20:14,960
What's that?

2450
02:20:17,060 --> 02:20:18,140
What was blinking?

2451
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:21,060
Amy Martin.

2452
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:22,240
It's the church.

2453
02:20:22,820 --> 02:20:24,080
Oh, it's the thunder, okay.

2454
02:20:24,660 --> 02:20:25,620
Or the lightning, I mean.

2455
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:28,700
Any spooky ladies?

2456
02:20:32,660 --> 02:20:33,500
What's this?

2457
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:34,300
Glasses.

2458
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:35,440
Bob's glasses.

2459
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:38,260
Stay back!

2460
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:39,280
Stay back!

2461
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:41,700
In the mirror it's gold though.

2462
02:20:44,260 --> 02:20:46,140
Okay, we gotta go upstairs, right?

2463
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:48,940
Stay back!

2464
02:20:55,130 --> 02:20:55,990
I see her!

2465
02:20:56,110 --> 02:20:56,410
I see her!

2466
02:20:56,750 --> 02:20:57,250
Hey, lady!

2467
02:20:59,650 --> 02:21:01,110
Is she in every room?

2468
02:21:02,410 --> 02:21:03,450
Not there.

2469
02:21:05,210 --> 02:21:06,510
How's the family photo?

2470
02:21:06,650 --> 02:21:07,590
Yeah, let's check it out.

2471
02:21:08,630 --> 02:21:10,790
I don't see her in this room either.

2472
02:21:13,870 --> 02:21:14,810
Or this room.

2473
02:21:14,870 --> 02:21:18,870
I always think the thing up here looks like a little ball with a face though.

2474
02:21:23,610 --> 02:21:24,910
How's our family photo?

2475
02:21:25,090 --> 02:21:25,950
Oh no!

2476
02:21:26,850 --> 02:21:28,530
That doesn't look very good.

2477
02:21:29,410 --> 02:21:30,030
Oh no!

2478
02:21:35,130 --> 02:21:37,230
I don't see a spooky lady in here.

2479
02:21:37,230 --> 02:21:37,750
Hello!

2480
02:21:41,890 --> 02:21:43,210
I don't remember anything further.

2481
02:21:43,590 --> 02:21:44,870
Oh, we didn't go in there.

2482
02:21:45,010 --> 02:21:46,290
What about into the toilet?

2483
02:21:48,330 --> 02:21:50,010
Any spooky ladies in the bathroom?

2484
02:21:50,230 --> 02:21:50,490
No?

2485
02:21:51,470 --> 02:21:52,190
The bedroom?

2486
02:21:53,930 --> 02:21:54,330
No?

2487
02:21:56,990 --> 02:21:58,630
Amy, are you in here?

2488
02:22:00,290 --> 02:22:02,450
Okay, so why don't we go into the kids room?

2489
02:22:03,530 --> 02:22:04,310
Amy, are you okay?

2490
02:22:04,730 --> 02:22:05,750
Are you okay, Amy?

2491
02:22:05,750 --> 02:22:07,350
Amy, are you okay?

2492
02:22:07,850 --> 02:22:08,410
Are you okay?

2493
02:22:08,590 --> 02:22:09,810
Are you okay, Amy?

2494
02:22:11,270 --> 02:22:11,830
Watch out, Minto!

2495
02:22:12,070 --> 02:22:12,410
Where?

2496
02:22:14,130 --> 02:22:17,090
I don't see a spooky lady.

2497
02:22:23,620 --> 02:22:26,440
Okay, up to the attic we go.

2498
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:27,720
There she is!

2499
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:34,460
Head outside and try to leave.

2500
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:36,060
I guess I could.

2501
02:22:38,320 --> 02:22:39,620
What if I do?

2502
02:22:40,480 --> 02:22:42,260
What if I do try to leave?

2503
02:22:51,190 --> 02:22:52,750
What if I'm like, you know what?

2504
02:22:53,730 --> 02:22:54,350
Amy...Oh!

2505
02:22:54,570 --> 02:22:55,190
Spooky lady.

2506
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:04,040
Oh my gosh!

2507
02:23:09,170 --> 02:23:10,690
I've never seen that before.

2508
02:23:12,330 --> 02:23:13,810
Oh my gosh!

2509
02:23:16,450 --> 02:23:17,950
That's so awesome!

2510
02:23:18,650 --> 02:23:19,090
Wow!

2511
02:23:19,330 --> 02:23:20,230
I've never seen that!

2512
02:23:22,610 --> 02:23:26,050
He's like, I must finish what I started.

2513
02:23:29,470 --> 02:23:30,170
Sadako.

2514
02:23:33,130 --> 02:23:35,170
Very Sadako-like, yes.

2515
02:23:38,030 --> 02:23:39,930
What is that lady?

2516
02:23:40,810 --> 02:23:41,510
Hello!

2517
02:23:42,870 --> 02:23:45,210
I'm here to save you.

2518
02:23:45,670 --> 02:23:47,430
You're here at last, priest.

2519
02:23:47,430 --> 02:23:51,210
Why are we going back to the basement?

2520
02:23:52,930 --> 02:23:53,510
Possum!

2521
02:23:56,890 --> 02:23:57,890
It's so quiet.

2522
02:23:58,030 --> 02:23:58,770
Sorry, you need to get better.

2523
02:23:59,330 --> 02:24:00,550
What about Meredith?

2524
02:24:00,970 --> 02:24:02,410
Did she get better?

2525
02:24:02,730 --> 02:24:03,330
Who is Meredith?

2526
02:24:04,150 --> 02:24:08,470
You couldn't save her, could you?

2527
02:24:09,150 --> 02:24:09,510
Ah!

2528
02:24:14,630 --> 02:24:15,350
Yeah!

2529
02:24:15,890 --> 02:24:17,810
Airdorf really cooked with this episode.

2530
02:24:18,170 --> 02:24:18,470
Right?

2531
02:24:20,670 --> 02:24:22,030
My little stick!

2532
02:24:23,310 --> 02:24:24,030
OK!

2533
02:24:27,330 --> 02:24:28,450
What do you mean Father Allred?

2534
02:24:28,490 --> 02:24:29,230
That guy is dead.

2535
02:24:38,470 --> 02:24:39,270
Oh my gosh!

2536
02:24:40,110 --> 02:24:46,780
More like Father Alldead.

2537
02:24:47,660 --> 02:24:49,680
October 30th, 1987.

2538
02:24:50,180 --> 02:24:52,440
One day until the profane Sabbath.

2539
02:25:04,140 --> 02:25:05,480
Spy on the neighbors.

2540
02:25:06,860 --> 02:25:08,220
Oh I do every time.

2541
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:11,120
I'm what they call the peeping priest.

2542
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:13,320
I look in through all the windows.

2543
02:25:15,920 --> 02:25:17,480
They're just like he's there again.

2544
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:18,860
Put on his shows.

2545
02:25:18,860 --> 02:25:19,940
LOL

2546
02:25:40,930 --> 02:25:44,530
May I call you Father Garcia?

2547
02:25:46,070 --> 02:25:48,610
OK What's my neighbors up to?

2548
02:25:50,330 --> 02:25:51,690
Vaya con Dios.

2549
02:25:55,850 --> 02:25:57,010
I'm here!

2550
02:25:57,750 --> 02:25:59,330
Oh no!

2551
02:26:00,810 --> 02:26:02,490
Are you just watching horror movies guys?

2552
02:26:03,150 --> 02:26:08,990
Thank you!

2553
02:26:11,470 --> 02:26:12,210
Sorry!

2554
02:26:14,090 --> 02:26:14,230
Oh!

2555
02:26:14,390 --> 02:26:15,270
Gary loves you!

2556
02:26:15,950 --> 02:26:16,190
Oh!

2557
02:26:16,390 --> 02:26:16,790
Bird!

2558
02:26:20,190 --> 02:26:22,250
This is like a sick music video.

2559
02:26:24,610 --> 02:26:25,070
LOL

2560
02:26:28,820 --> 02:26:30,220
Harvey thanks for the 10 gift card!

2561
02:26:32,520 --> 02:26:32,980
Oh!

2562
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:36,260
What the heck is that?

2563
02:26:37,800 --> 02:26:38,580
Loves you Gary!

2564
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:39,740
Loves you Gary!

2565
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:47,780
Loves

2566
02:27:01,620 --> 02:27:01,800
you!

2567
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:02,620
Gary loves you!

2568
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:03,520
Gary loves you!

2569
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:04,300
LOL

2570
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:09,980
Sick channel!

2571
02:27:12,260 --> 02:27:12,900
Oh!

2572
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,240
Thanks for the gifts you guys!

2573
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:15,220
Thank you!

2574
02:27:15,300 --> 02:27:16,960
Sorry I was too into my music video.

2575
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:19,320
Sirstreak!

2576
02:27:19,780 --> 02:27:20,420
Alvin!

2577
02:27:21,180 --> 02:27:21,560
Ducky!

2578
02:27:22,060 --> 02:27:23,060
Thank you guys!

2579
02:27:24,380 --> 02:27:25,340
Let's go!

2580
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:29,320
Leave ya!

2581
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:36,620
Ah!

2582
02:27:37,660 --> 02:27:38,860
Which mix was that?

2583
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:41,980
It was the Gary mix.

2584
02:27:43,880 --> 02:27:44,860
Oh my gosh!

2585
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:47,260
Police officer!

2586
02:27:48,560 --> 02:27:51,040
You almost ran me over!

2587
02:27:51,800 --> 02:27:52,740
Holy moly!

2588
02:27:53,580 --> 02:27:53,920
Oh!

2589
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:55,600
There is a standoff?

2590
02:27:56,740 --> 02:27:58,800
I think I'm at the wrong place.

2591
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:05,320
Oh!

2592
02:28:07,820 --> 02:28:08,020
Oh!

2593
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:08,120
Ok!

2594
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:09,120
I'm at the right place.

2595
02:28:10,460 --> 02:28:12,360
What if I go to the other side of the street?

2596
02:28:14,540 --> 02:28:14,740
Oh!

2597
02:28:14,820 --> 02:28:14,940
No!

2598
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:15,320
Ok!

2599
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:18,360
Yeah!

2600
02:28:18,420 --> 02:28:19,260
They can handle it.

2601
02:28:19,420 --> 02:28:19,660
Yeah!

2602
02:28:23,360 --> 02:28:24,160
Excuse me!

2603
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:26,300
Oh!

2604
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:26,960
Just a second.

2605
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:27,700
I'm a priest.

2606
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:29,340
You shouldn't let me in.

2607
02:28:30,180 --> 02:28:30,860
Excuse me!

2608
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:34,540
I'm just walking in the middle of this active road.

2609
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:37,860
I'm just like...

2610
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:43,540
Excuse me!

2611
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:44,340
What's going on?

2612
02:28:44,980 --> 02:28:45,960
Hello officer!

2613
02:28:48,180 --> 02:28:49,920
I'm going to speak in through the back.

2614
02:28:50,200 --> 02:28:50,900
Excuse me!

2615
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:53,520
Can anybody tell me what's going on here?

2616
02:28:54,280 --> 02:28:54,860
Ok bye!

2617
02:28:56,040 --> 02:28:57,540
No one will ever notice.

2618
02:28:58,960 --> 02:28:59,440
Oh!

2619
02:28:59,640 --> 02:29:03,720
Even the bad guy, whoever they are trying to get, could just sneak out through the back.

2620
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:06,560
They are so preoccupied with the front.

2621
02:29:07,800 --> 02:29:09,620
The guy is probably already gone.

2622
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:12,940
I'm so sneaky.

2623
02:29:14,020 --> 02:29:14,840
A riddle priest.

2624
02:29:15,340 --> 02:29:17,020
How do you make a portal to hell?

2625
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:19,700
Come see me and I'll show you.

2626
02:29:22,980 --> 02:29:24,240
The tunnels... Wait!

2627
02:29:24,620 --> 02:29:27,240
The tunnels await, but I wanted to check... Hold on.

2628
02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:29,280
I didn't get to go down.

2629
02:29:35,980 --> 02:29:37,060
Hey guys!

2630
02:29:37,540 --> 02:29:38,560
I'm not the killer.

2631
02:29:39,460 --> 02:29:40,520
Don't mind me.

2632
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:41,440
I'm just a priest.

2633
02:29:43,980 --> 02:29:45,700
Wait, are these the tunnels?

2634
02:29:46,480 --> 02:29:47,680
I'll crawl through them.

2635
02:29:54,100 --> 02:29:56,240
Save and go see the police.

2636
02:29:56,540 --> 02:29:58,440
Wait, how do I go see the police?

2637
02:30:02,320 --> 02:30:03,000
Ben!

2638
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:09,320
Ben has... Ben likes throwing people into the air.

2639
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:11,620
What's this?

2640
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:12,080
Hangman?

2641
02:30:12,840 --> 02:30:16,860
Oh, just leave through the front door?

2642
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:17,180
Ok.

2643
02:30:18,740 --> 02:30:21,840
It's just save so I'll just... Oh Gary loves you.

2644
02:30:24,340 --> 02:30:25,380
Front door.

2645
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:26,280
I'm on my way.

2646
02:30:26,380 --> 02:30:27,160
I'll go check it out.

2647
02:30:27,640 --> 02:30:29,220
Then we'll explore a little bit through here.

2648
02:30:29,460 --> 02:30:30,200
Welcome children!

2649
02:30:33,080 --> 02:30:33,700
Here we go!

2650
02:30:35,380 --> 02:30:36,560
Oh my god!

2651
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:38,800
Oh my god!

2652
02:30:39,220 --> 02:30:40,280
Oh my god!

2653
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:41,360
Oh my god!

2654
02:30:46,080 --> 02:30:53,090
That was like the craziest bullet hell ever.

2655
02:30:57,510 --> 02:30:59,870
They were hitting the other guys.

2656
02:31:01,010 --> 02:31:04,390
A, B, C, D, E, F, G...

2657
02:31:04,390 --> 02:31:11,250
H, I, J, K, L Gary loves you.

2658
02:31:11,790 --> 02:31:12,750
Gary loves us.

2659
02:31:13,450 --> 02:31:16,910
Mother moon watcheth her little ones behind a door of sleep.

2660
02:31:17,350 --> 02:31:18,870
Daughter chalice is filled.

2661
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:21,210
Daughter chalice is filled.

2662
02:31:21,470 --> 02:31:25,090
An offering to the Master in the unseen world.

2663
02:31:25,670 --> 02:31:29,130
Spirit bird arriveth from afar and cometh back to roost.

2664
02:31:29,790 --> 02:31:32,190
These vessels are the unholy trinity.

2665
02:31:32,190 --> 02:31:34,370
The fallen star shall guide them.

2666
02:31:34,610 --> 02:31:36,010
What colors can you see?

2667
02:31:36,530 --> 02:31:38,530
Look to the children if you are lost.

2668
02:31:39,730 --> 02:31:41,650
I don't know what any of that means.

2669
02:31:42,050 --> 02:31:45,970
Oh, there's the chalice and the star and the bird.

2670
02:31:46,170 --> 02:31:46,490
Okay.

2671
02:31:48,750 --> 02:31:50,590
Hold on, there's other pictures though.

2672
02:31:55,630 --> 02:31:58,730
Oh, there's little bugs in the flowers.

2673
02:31:59,490 --> 02:32:00,990
That's where they belong.

2674
02:32:01,270 --> 02:32:02,530
Not in my maid cafe.

2675
02:32:05,490 --> 02:32:07,170
Mason, age six.

2676
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:09,570
I don't like that.

2677
02:32:09,930 --> 02:32:12,810
He's eating the mushrooms, just like in Mario.

2678
02:32:17,150 --> 02:32:23,070
Kaylee likes cats and she's crying about... Oh, even the cat is crying!

2679
02:32:23,130 --> 02:32:23,710
My dream!

2680
02:32:24,130 --> 02:32:24,770
No!

2681
02:32:25,470 --> 02:32:27,250
Kaylee, that's not a dream, that's a nightmare!

2682
02:32:27,730 --> 02:32:28,470
Kaylee, no!

2683
02:32:30,770 --> 02:32:32,390
Tyler, age seven.

2684
02:32:32,570 --> 02:32:33,450
Uncle Earl.

2685
02:32:34,630 --> 02:32:36,730
She has blastless phobia.

2686
02:32:38,720 --> 02:32:39,750
What about this one?

2687
02:32:41,510 --> 02:32:43,190
Max, age five.

2688
02:32:44,010 --> 02:32:46,730
Okay, these children are so cursed.

2689
02:32:47,830 --> 02:32:49,030
I didn't mean to say children.

2690
02:32:49,790 --> 02:32:50,930
Our family!

2691
02:32:54,170 --> 02:32:57,050
The cat is so cute though!

2692
02:32:59,950 --> 02:33:03,290
A... A... A... Amar?

2693
02:33:04,810 --> 02:33:07,370
Just Blair Witch Project, you know?

2694
02:33:08,550 --> 02:33:10,410
Whoa, Arcee!

2695
02:33:10,510 --> 02:33:12,070
Yeah, he's normal!

2696
02:33:13,430 --> 02:33:14,830
Omar, oh...

2697
02:33:17,290 --> 02:33:18,250
And then Sarah.

2698
02:33:18,570 --> 02:33:20,730
Oh, Sarah, age four.

2699
02:33:21,570 --> 02:33:24,050
Sarah has such an imagination, such a way with...

2700
02:33:24,050 --> 02:33:27,990
She's real... She just really likes... What the hell is that?

2701
02:33:28,090 --> 02:33:28,730
She really likes...

2702
02:33:35,230 --> 02:33:36,370
Thanks, Satin!

2703
02:33:36,590 --> 02:33:37,510
Oh, Ultra Kill!

2704
02:33:37,670 --> 02:33:38,530
It's the Ultra Kill guy.

2705
02:33:40,830 --> 02:33:42,050
Yay, Satin!

2706
02:33:47,030 --> 02:33:49,050
Satin gives us money, baby.

2707
02:33:49,050 --> 02:33:53,750
What is that thing in the other room, though?

2708
02:33:55,290 --> 02:33:56,830
A little bit of concern.

2709
02:33:58,310 --> 02:33:59,650
Cash money, baby!

2710
02:33:59,850 --> 02:34:00,870
Satin makes you a millionaire!

2711
02:34:04,010 --> 02:34:05,290
L, age four.

2712
02:34:05,570 --> 02:34:05,770
Ew!

2713
02:34:06,290 --> 02:34:06,650
Oh!

2714
02:34:08,150 --> 02:34:09,490
That's not in the other room.

2715
02:34:09,670 --> 02:34:10,190
Interesting.

2716
02:34:11,070 --> 02:34:11,350
Okay.

2717
02:34:13,470 --> 02:34:14,510
It's Satin.

2718
02:34:18,310 --> 02:34:20,330
All right, so we go on in.

2719
02:34:20,450 --> 02:34:22,110
What was the note about again?

2720
02:34:22,250 --> 02:34:22,590
Hold on.

2721
02:34:24,470 --> 02:34:26,550
Is this a Petscop reference?

2722
02:34:27,510 --> 02:34:28,310
I don't know.

2723
02:34:30,730 --> 02:34:32,950
I hate that I have to scroll all the way through.

2724
02:34:33,070 --> 02:34:33,770
It's kind of annoying.

2725
02:34:36,390 --> 02:34:38,230
Oh, I missed a couple notes!

2726
02:34:38,310 --> 02:34:38,650
Oh, no!

2727
02:34:41,730 --> 02:34:43,310
Oh, no, I missed a couple.

2728
02:34:43,610 --> 02:34:45,430
No, that's so sad.

2729
02:34:49,090 --> 02:34:50,010
Uh, okay.

2730
02:34:51,350 --> 02:34:52,790
The daughter chalice is filled.

2731
02:34:53,650 --> 02:34:54,510
Spirit bird.

2732
02:34:54,690 --> 02:34:55,510
Chalice bird.

2733
02:34:56,050 --> 02:34:56,330
Oh, wait.

2734
02:34:56,470 --> 02:34:58,490
Oh, moon, chalice, bird.

2735
02:34:59,090 --> 02:35:00,410
Moon, chalice, bird.

2736
02:35:04,970 --> 02:35:06,610
And then it leads to the star.

2737
02:35:09,270 --> 02:35:12,890
Pretty sure one of the walls in the candy tunnel in part two said hail satin.

2738
02:35:12,890 --> 02:35:13,270
It did!

2739
02:35:13,370 --> 02:35:13,670
It did!

2740
02:35:13,770 --> 02:35:14,250
It did!

2741
02:35:14,830 --> 02:35:18,130
Are the children writing the... Who was teaching them how to spell?

2742
02:35:20,070 --> 02:35:21,490
Wait, I thought this was a hole.

2743
02:35:22,830 --> 02:35:24,310
Okay, hold on.

2744
02:35:26,990 --> 02:35:28,710
Oh, oops, I messed up, you guys.

2745
02:35:36,270 --> 02:35:37,030
Moon.

2746
02:35:40,390 --> 02:35:41,150
Chalice.

2747
02:35:46,730 --> 02:35:47,490
Bird.

2748
02:35:47,490 --> 02:35:48,250
Star.

2749
02:35:56,980 --> 02:35:58,540
They changed colors.

2750
02:35:58,680 --> 02:36:00,160
Do I have to make the color correct?

2751
02:36:00,320 --> 02:36:00,960
Oh, shoot.

2752
02:36:02,120 --> 02:36:02,960
Oh, hold on.

2753
02:36:03,620 --> 02:36:07,020
Moon watcheth behind a door of sleep.

2754
02:36:10,220 --> 02:36:11,820
Chalice is filled.

2755
02:36:16,740 --> 02:36:18,940
What if they were all pink?

2756
02:36:27,080 --> 02:36:27,560
Pink.

2757
02:36:27,860 --> 02:36:29,200
Uh, read the last line.

2758
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:29,920
Oh, oh.

2759
02:36:34,400 --> 02:36:35,500
Um, yeah.

2760
02:36:37,080 --> 02:36:38,520
What colors can you see?

2761
02:36:38,680 --> 02:36:39,460
Look to the children.

2762
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:43,200
Oh, the drawings.

2763
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:44,340
Wait, the bird was green.

2764
02:36:44,420 --> 02:36:45,180
I remember that.

2765
02:36:50,740 --> 02:36:52,440
It was like that, but I'll...

2766
02:36:53,460 --> 02:36:54,220
Okay, okay.

2767
02:36:56,120 --> 02:36:57,460
What was this one?

2768
02:36:58,400 --> 02:36:59,120
Was it anything?

2769
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:00,980
Red star.

2770
02:37:01,220 --> 02:37:01,960
Red star.

2771
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:03,240
Okay, we got that.

2772
02:37:03,580 --> 02:37:03,700
Oh.

2773
02:37:07,460 --> 02:37:08,680
Red star.

2774
02:37:11,160 --> 02:37:11,740
Um.

2775
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:14,920
Nothing.

2776
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:22,700
Uh, orange moon.

2777
02:37:23,400 --> 02:37:24,380
Orange moon.

2778
02:37:25,300 --> 02:37:26,440
Does the... Do the colors stay?

2779
02:37:28,020 --> 02:37:29,660
No, they don't.

2780
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:31,120
Okay, star red.

2781
02:37:32,260 --> 02:37:34,000
Moon orange.

2782
02:37:36,700 --> 02:37:38,580
Okay, we'll come back.

2783
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:39,180
We'll come back.

2784
02:37:43,100 --> 02:37:44,180
Nothing.

2785
02:37:46,980 --> 02:37:48,060
Nothing.

2786
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:50,720
Pink chalice.

2787
02:37:54,580 --> 02:37:57,260
My dumb ass is like, what if I made them all pink?

2788
02:38:03,620 --> 02:38:06,040
I'm double checking the birds since I'm here.

2789
02:38:10,160 --> 02:38:11,680
Oh, it was a blue bird.

2790
02:38:12,740 --> 02:38:13,700
Blue bird.

2791
02:38:15,980 --> 02:38:16,840
That one was green.

2792
02:38:16,980 --> 02:38:18,440
Oh, the money was green.

2793
02:38:20,720 --> 02:38:23,440
I was thinking of the green money thanks to satin.

2794
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:26,800
Twitter.

2795
02:38:28,520 --> 02:38:30,300
Okay, bird.

2796
02:38:33,060 --> 02:38:35,080
It's a dark blue, that one.

2797
02:38:35,340 --> 02:38:37,260
Okay, star is red.

2798
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:39,380
Chalice is pink.

2799
02:38:42,540 --> 02:38:44,320
Pink, pink, pink.

2800
02:38:45,540 --> 02:38:47,440
And the moon is orange.

2801
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:53,280
There we go.

2802
02:38:53,380 --> 02:38:53,700
Yay!

2803
02:38:55,940 --> 02:38:57,820
This is where it lives.

2804
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:02,060
Um.

2805
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:11,240
Okay.

2806
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:15,980
Oh boy.

2807
02:39:17,400 --> 02:39:18,760
Oh, this part.

2808
02:39:18,840 --> 02:39:19,640
What does that mean?

2809
02:39:20,120 --> 02:39:21,000
Oh gosh.

2810
02:39:25,930 --> 02:39:27,530
Oh my god, no.

2811
02:39:27,890 --> 02:39:27,990
Oh.

2812
02:39:30,030 --> 02:39:33,090
If you are reading this, then congratulations!

2813
02:39:33,090 --> 02:39:39,430
You are on your way to experiencing the wonders of our unspeakable future under the guidance of Gary.

2814
02:39:39,930 --> 02:39:40,990
Gary, our brother.

2815
02:39:41,890 --> 02:39:43,070
Gary, our friend.

2816
02:39:43,590 --> 02:39:46,690
Gary, a normal human being, just like you and me.

2817
02:39:46,750 --> 02:39:49,830
The more they say it, the less convincing it becomes.

2818
02:39:51,690 --> 02:40:08,030
As a tier one acolyte, you are just beginning your unspeakable journey to eventually see what Gary sees and prove yourself worthy to be a vessel fit to experience the second death reserved for only the most worthy.

2819
02:40:08,930 --> 02:40:09,450
Tiffany?

2820
02:40:09,830 --> 02:40:11,310
That girl was not worthy.

2821
02:40:12,870 --> 02:40:19,050
To find out if you are a vessel, remember to attend meetings of the eternal order of the second death twice a week.

2822
02:40:21,010 --> 02:40:23,070
Come to the group meetings.

2823
02:40:24,150 --> 02:40:25,170
Follow Gary's instructions.

2824
02:40:30,590 --> 02:40:30,970
Oh my god, exactly.

2825
02:40:32,090 --> 02:40:34,330
Be honest with him in all that you do.

2826
02:40:34,590 --> 02:40:38,510
Do not ever ask what has been behind the door in the basement of the clinic.

2827
02:40:40,810 --> 02:40:42,390
The one we went to.

2828
02:40:46,230 --> 02:40:49,070
The one we went to.

2829
02:40:49,210 --> 02:40:50,890
A normal wisp, just like you and me.

2830
02:40:51,130 --> 02:40:52,430
With all the babies.

2831
02:40:53,330 --> 02:40:55,450
Sorry if I'm making you yawn too, guys.

2832
02:40:59,260 --> 02:41:00,600
I'm just a little sleepy.

2833
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,480
She consumed six little twigs.

2834
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,580
Only two were left to walk as husks.

2835
02:41:10,780 --> 02:41:11,680
Go ahead, priest.

2836
02:41:12,020 --> 02:41:14,160
Stare into the eyes of my mother.

2837
02:41:16,100 --> 02:41:17,320
I'm mommy?

2838
02:41:23,440 --> 02:41:27,380
Oh, what beautiful eyes you have.

2839
02:41:30,940 --> 02:41:32,580
Uh, okay.

2840
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:35,580
Oh, I can't get around her?

2841
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:37,460
I just have to keep looking at her?

2842
02:41:40,140 --> 02:41:43,560
Um, looks very Mona Lisa-esque.

2843
02:41:44,900 --> 02:41:45,140
Oh!

2844
02:41:47,260 --> 02:41:51,860
Um, Mona Lisa, five days on vtubers.

2845
02:41:54,190 --> 02:41:55,500
Two weeks on vtubers.

2846
02:41:59,900 --> 02:42:01,440
Oh, I'm still staring.

2847
02:42:01,720 --> 02:42:04,320
Oh gosh, three months on vtubers.

2848
02:42:10,420 --> 02:42:12,600
Oh, one year on vtubers.

2849
02:42:15,960 --> 02:42:16,600
Yeah,

2850
02:42:26,550 --> 02:42:28,110
I guess it's time to go.

2851
02:42:32,390 --> 02:42:35,570
Gosh, this guy loves walking through tunnels, I swear.

2852
02:42:37,470 --> 02:42:39,970
What's up with these cultists in tunnels?

2853
02:42:40,490 --> 02:42:41,570
I don't understand.

2854
02:42:42,530 --> 02:42:58,090
Gaze upon the magnificence of La Pieta Corotta.

2855
02:43:01,250 --> 02:43:09,970
This beautiful statue depicts a faithful member of the order receiving the second death in the loving embrace of Et Mater.

2856
02:43:11,890 --> 02:43:18,370
Two such statues were commissioned thanks to the generous patronage of the Save Family.

2857
02:43:19,530 --> 02:43:20,890
Sorry, it's really funny.

2858
02:43:21,410 --> 02:43:28,670
You never think about how cult people get their things, like their little statues, but they're talking like such vtubers.

2859
02:43:28,810 --> 02:43:30,650
They're like, we commissioned this artwork.

2860
02:43:33,450 --> 02:43:37,250
Just, just, just, just like a normal vtuber.

2861
02:43:39,450 --> 02:43:44,690
Um, we invite everyone to reverently approach the statue whenever they are in need of rest.

2862
02:43:45,570 --> 02:43:46,970
So is this a save point?

2863
02:43:51,790 --> 02:43:54,130
If you are reading this, congratulations!

2864
02:43:54,530 --> 02:44:01,370
You have officially been granted tier two status in the eternal order of the second death.

2865
02:44:01,430 --> 02:44:02,190
Oh my gosh.

2866
02:44:03,650 --> 02:44:07,770
So like, oh my gosh, what if this is like a sorority?

2867
02:44:08,810 --> 02:44:15,750
Upon crossing the threshold from tier one to tier two, your life as an acolyte will change dramatically.

2868
02:44:16,490 --> 02:44:25,430
You may start noticing shadowy figures in the corner of rooms or experience feelings of lost time when holding sharp objects.

2869
02:44:25,910 --> 02:44:31,150
Ancient symbols written in blood will materialize on the floor and walls of your home.

2870
02:44:31,990 --> 02:44:34,470
Animals will no longer trust you.

2871
02:44:34,810 --> 02:44:40,010
You may emit a foul odor that will cause your former loved ones to avoid you.

2872
02:44:41,390 --> 02:44:48,370
These are just a few of the marvelous blessings that await you in this new stage of life.

2873
02:44:49,170 --> 02:44:59,530
If you remain loyal to Gary, your journey towards becoming a vessel for the second death will progress to new levels of knowledge and power.

2874
02:45:00,210 --> 02:45:02,010
Oh my god.

2875
02:45:02,470 --> 02:45:13,550
Remember, if you neglect your weekly meetings or do not pay your pay your dues to the order, your fingers will be forcibly bent backwards.

2876
02:45:14,230 --> 02:45:15,170
Gary loves you.

2877
02:45:22,010 --> 02:45:23,110
Oh my god.

2878
02:45:25,390 --> 02:45:27,470
Uh, sneaking mission, I think?

2879
02:45:27,550 --> 02:45:27,710
Maybe?

2880
02:45:30,930 --> 02:45:34,550
Anyway, uh, I'm just a priest.

2881
02:45:45,820 --> 02:45:46,340
Okay.

2882
02:45:46,340 --> 02:45:47,180
Oh my god.

2883
02:45:56,180 --> 02:45:56,960
Toxic what?

2884
02:45:57,220 --> 02:45:57,220
What?

2885
02:45:57,480 --> 02:45:58,820
Toxic dog breath?

2886
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:00,200
What are you saying to me?

2887
02:46:01,240 --> 02:46:02,000
Gary loves you.

2888
02:46:02,060 --> 02:46:02,380
I know.

2889
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:03,300
I know.

2890
02:46:11,530 --> 02:46:12,690
Nekozuki, welcome to membership!

2891
02:46:13,370 --> 02:46:14,890
Oh, the second death.

2892
02:46:20,930 --> 02:46:21,930
Toxic dog breath.

2893
02:46:22,170 --> 02:46:23,270
I can't suck it.

2894
02:46:23,630 --> 02:46:24,130
Not here.

2895
02:46:24,250 --> 02:46:25,410
Toxic dog breath.

2896
02:46:30,180 --> 02:46:30,920
Wait, was there?

2897
02:46:31,080 --> 02:46:31,540
Hold on.

2898
02:46:31,960 --> 02:46:32,500
Oh, my bad.

2899
02:46:36,220 --> 02:46:37,660
Sorry to go through all my notes.

2900
02:46:37,860 --> 02:46:40,620
Gosh, I wish there was an easier way to go through the notes.

2901
02:46:40,620 --> 02:46:45,500
Uh, there were only two left to walk as husks.

2902
02:46:45,900 --> 02:46:47,560
Oh, stare into my eyes.

2903
02:46:47,800 --> 02:46:48,560
Pond crossing.

2904
02:46:49,860 --> 02:46:50,280
Oh, wait.

2905
02:46:51,220 --> 02:46:52,240
Is it the statues?

2906
02:46:54,160 --> 02:46:54,560
No.

2907
02:46:55,100 --> 02:46:56,260
Minto loves you.

2908
02:47:00,300 --> 02:47:02,180
Is Minto getting the true ending?

2909
02:47:02,260 --> 02:47:02,860
I'm trying.

2910
02:47:02,860 --> 02:47:05,240
There you are, you toxic dog death.

2911
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:06,520
Toxic dog breath.

2912
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:07,280
Toxic dog.

2913
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:07,500
Oh.

Ghost priest going up against cultists and exercising demons.

2917
02:47:19,440 --> 02:47:20,400
Indeed a work of hearsay.

2918
02:47:20,680 --> 02:47:21,720
What do you mean?

2919
02:47:24,480 --> 02:47:27,240
Or dog stirreth his pot full of sinners.

2920
02:47:27,520 --> 02:47:28,740
The seats revolve.

2921
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:30,580
Oh gosh, you guys.

2922
02:47:30,620 --> 02:47:31,860
I don't know how to play checkers.

2923
02:47:32,860 --> 02:47:33,900
Toxic dog breath.

2924
02:47:34,340 --> 02:47:35,300
Toxic dog breath.

Bale giveth favor.

2926
02:47:40,940 --> 02:47:42,680
The low seats are made high.

2927
02:47:46,770 --> 02:47:49,050
Five seats in the north facing west.

2928
02:47:49,870 --> 02:47:51,550
Five in the south face.

2929
02:47:54,430 --> 02:47:55,030
Bales.

2930
02:47:59,230 --> 02:48:00,890
Solve it for real this time, Mint.

2931
02:48:00,910 --> 02:48:01,690
You can get it.

2932
02:48:04,610 --> 02:48:06,470
What am I supposed to do, though?

2933
02:48:09,150 --> 02:48:10,090
Okay, hold on.

2934
02:48:10,110 --> 02:48:11,030
Let me go up and see.

2935
02:48:13,790 --> 02:48:14,430
Oh.

2936
02:48:15,970 --> 02:48:18,990
Uh, okay, hold on.

2937
02:48:23,550 --> 02:48:24,450
It's connected?

2938
02:48:27,010 --> 02:48:28,050
Toxic dog breath.

2939
02:48:29,230 --> 02:48:29,870
Okay.

2940
02:48:30,510 --> 02:48:31,850
Toxic dog breath.

2941
02:48:32,830 --> 02:48:33,430
Okay.

2942
02:48:34,290 --> 02:48:34,810
Oh.

2943
02:48:36,550 --> 02:48:37,070
What?

2944
02:48:37,450 --> 02:48:39,210
Five seats in the north facing west.

2945
02:48:40,030 --> 02:48:44,310
Five seats in the south facing... oh gosh, this is...

2946
02:48:44,310 --> 02:48:46,730

02:49:06,810 --> 02:49:07,830
Bale giveth favor.

2953
02:49:07,950 --> 02:49:09,250
The low seats are made high.

2954
02:49:10,290 --> 02:49:10,850
Huh?

2955
02:49:11,930 --> 02:49:13,830
Okay, I'm just gonna go talk to somebody.

2956
02:49:14,790 --> 02:49:16,030
Let's talk to the owl.

2957
02:49:16,330 --> 02:49:17,210
Mr. Owl.

2958
02:49:18,130 --> 02:49:19,570
Um, what do I do?

2959
02:49:26,370 --> 02:49:27,490
He is...

2960
02:49:27,490 --> 02:49:28,970
Did any change happen?

2961
02:49:32,370 --> 02:49:33,410
Actually can't tell.

2962
02:49:33,410 --> 02:49:33,790
Huh?

2963
02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:40,460
What happened?

2964
02:49:40,540 --> 02:49:41,140
What changed?

2965
02:49:44,320 --> 02:49:45,580
Did they change?

2966
02:49:46,320 --> 02:49:47,940
Change places!

2967
02:49:49,640 --> 02:49:51,060
The run killer.

2968
02:49:55,410 --> 02:49:56,890
Okay, let's talk to the chef.

2969
02:49:58,870 --> 02:50:01,330
Chef, what have you say?

2970
02:50:02,730 --> 02:50:05,210
Oh, they moved again.

2971
02:50:08,820 --> 02:50:10,920
Who would have thunk that would happen?

2972
02:50:15,820 --> 02:50:18,580
So, uh, there was one guy here.

2973
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:21,600
Oh, I think they flipped, right?

2974
02:50:21,780 --> 02:50:28,360
This is the one that said... hold on, he... so the chef is, uh, is Bale.

2975
02:50:31,660 --> 02:50:32,260
Right?

2976
02:50:34,220 --> 02:50:35,440
What do you mean almost?

2977
02:50:45,220 --> 02:50:46,840
And then the owl...

2978
02:50:48,780 --> 02:50:51,460
I think... I don't know.

2979
02:50:53,640 --> 02:50:54,880
I don't know.

2980
02:51:05,780 --> 02:51:07,640
You got this, we won't backseat.

2981
02:51:07,860 --> 02:51:10,020
I don't even know what I'm supposed to do though.

2982
02:51:12,220 --> 02:51:14,620
All right, let's try the old man.

2983
02:51:20,480 --> 02:51:21,000
What?

2984
02:51:23,820 --> 02:51:25,720
I don't know.

2985
02:51:29,640 --> 02:51:30,840
Oh, I think I did it.

2986
02:51:31,320 --> 02:51:32,700
Oh no, that's ambiance.

2987
02:51:41,520 --> 02:51:44,040
Um... or I did something correct.

2988
02:51:50,620 --> 02:51:51,500
Okay, uh...

2989
02:51:56,380 --> 02:52:03,940
But, like, five seats in the north... five facing... okay, so this is what I'm... okay, five seats in the north...

2990
02:52:05,240 --> 02:52:05,880
...west.

2991
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:08,320
One, two, three... oh, okay, okay.

2992
02:52:08,760 --> 02:52:10,660
Oh, I just need this one.

2993
02:52:11,280 --> 02:52:13,820
It's a face... faith... faith...

2994
02:52:14,640 --> 02:52:16,680
Sorry, face west.

2995
02:52:17,240 --> 02:52:21,260
Oh, but all of them are... these ones are correct.

2996
02:52:22,120 --> 02:52:24,420
The five facing east.

2997
02:52:25,520 --> 02:52:26,160
No!

2998
02:52:33,370 --> 02:52:34,010
Um...

2999
02:52:34,010 --> 02:52:35,330
Uh, we don't want that one.

3000
02:52:38,010 --> 02:52:40,630
So, uh... the seats revolve.

3001
02:52:45,300 --> 02:52:47,220
The low seats are made high.

3002
02:52:47,560 --> 02:52:49,140
Does that mean they all switch?

3003
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:51,700
Like it goes... like it does like a flipperoo?

3004
02:52:52,460 --> 02:52:53,740
How do I turn you over?

3005
02:52:53,780 --> 02:52:55,700
Just use your hands, priest.

3006
02:52:55,860 --> 02:52:58,440
Oh, sorry, I remember he's got them spaghetti arms, you guys.

3007
02:52:58,980 --> 02:52:59,570
So do I...

3008
02:53:02,380 --> 02:53:04,140
I mixed up east and west.

3009
02:53:05,120 --> 02:53:07,200
Oh, weest.

3010
02:53:07,400 --> 02:53:07,760
Yeah.

3011
02:53:08,920 --> 02:53:14,720
So, okay, we gotta... hold on, which one was Andrus?

3012
02:53:21,030 --> 02:53:22,810
Um... was it you?

3013
02:53:24,430 --> 02:53:28,210
This guy made them go up and down, so he's that one.

3014
02:53:28,570 --> 02:53:29,470
Maybe it's this one.

3015
02:53:33,710 --> 02:53:34,790
Are you Mr. Owl?

3016
02:53:37,790 --> 02:53:38,410
Yes.

3017
02:53:43,580 --> 02:53:44,880
Talk to dog breath.

3018
02:53:49,800 --> 02:53:50,900
Wait a second.

3019
02:53:51,100 --> 02:53:52,740
No, they're all jumbled around.

3020
02:53:54,140 --> 02:53:55,100
Wait, they're jumbled.

3021
02:53:55,880 --> 02:53:56,600
Uh-oh, wait.

3022
02:54:00,670 --> 02:54:02,130
So, oh, no, no, just kidding.

3023
02:54:02,330 --> 02:54:05,590
Five seats in the north facing west.

3024
02:54:08,430 --> 02:54:10,550
Five in the south facing east.

3025
02:54:12,390 --> 02:54:13,810
I messed up.

3026
02:54:17,980 --> 02:54:21,320
It's backwards, but which one is Andrus?

3027
02:54:21,620 --> 02:54:22,540
You can undo them.

3028
02:54:36,520 --> 02:54:37,560
They shuffle.

3029
02:54:41,470 --> 02:54:43,190
They just shuffle around.

3030
02:54:45,910 --> 02:54:47,110
So, it's not him.

3031
02:54:47,190 --> 02:54:47,910
It's gotta be this one.

3032
02:55:00,330 --> 02:55:01,350
What's happening?

3033
02:55:01,350 --> 02:55:01,350
What's happening?

3034
02:55:03,530 --> 02:55:04,710
I took too long.

3035
02:55:05,290 --> 02:55:06,490
I took too long.

3036
02:55:11,110 --> 02:55:11,890
The children.

3037
02:55:12,690 --> 02:55:14,010
Oh, there's someone in every window.

3038
02:55:14,870 --> 02:55:15,530
What is going on?

3039
02:55:15,610 --> 02:55:17,650
What the hell is this ring-ass video?

3040
02:55:21,470 --> 02:55:23,630
Oh my gosh, I feel like we're getting cursed for real.

3041
02:55:30,370 --> 02:55:32,930
Oh, yeah, I love the party people.

3042
02:55:34,650 --> 02:55:35,750
Is that a whale?

3043
02:55:35,890 --> 02:55:39,230
No, I don't like the beached whales.

3044
02:55:40,870 --> 02:55:42,110
Oh, Ria Jewel, Bakuhatsu.

3045
02:55:42,770 --> 02:55:44,830
Oh, is that me?

3046
02:55:46,310 --> 02:55:49,470
Oh, no, that looks like a grandpa.

3047
02:55:51,270 --> 02:55:52,790
It was like a Warhammer reference.

3048
02:55:56,870 --> 02:55:58,330
Don't do it.

3049
02:56:05,610 --> 02:56:08,190
Is this death stranding?

3050
02:56:08,850 --> 02:56:10,370
I think this is the ring.

3051
02:56:10,610 --> 02:56:11,610
Oh my god.

3052
02:56:12,250 --> 02:56:13,270
Oh god.

3053
02:56:14,350 --> 02:56:14,850
Bird.

3054
02:56:16,730 --> 02:56:18,550
Now you are ready.

3055
02:56:21,600 --> 02:56:23,220
Wait, did I solve it?

3056
02:56:27,600 --> 02:56:31,160
Um, there's no way in hell I'm going back in there.

3057
02:56:32,260 --> 02:56:33,160
I did.

3058
02:56:33,440 --> 02:56:36,400
Oh, I'm a secret genius, I think.

3059
02:56:37,820 --> 02:56:40,380
Is there any sneaky ladies around here?

3060
02:56:43,400 --> 02:56:44,500
Hey, sneaky.

3061
02:56:46,320 --> 02:56:48,920
Oh my god, that's not a sneaky lady.

3062
02:56:49,300 --> 02:56:50,680
That's a dead lady.

3063
02:56:50,840 --> 02:56:51,980
Oh my god.

3064
02:56:52,740 --> 02:56:56,480
Um, uh, my bad.

3065
02:56:57,140 --> 02:57:00,000
Go see

3066
02:57:03,190 --> 02:57:04,190
Father Allred.

3067
02:57:04,770 --> 02:57:07,770
Yeah, Father Allmight.

3068
02:57:10,130 --> 02:57:12,470
God, the music in this game is too good.

3069
02:57:13,370 --> 02:57:17,170
Like the ambiance mix of music stuff like that, you know.

3070
02:57:18,730 --> 02:57:22,330
Oh, spooky.

3071
02:57:23,410 --> 02:57:25,590
Are you guys feeling the Halloween spirit?

3072
02:57:27,050 --> 02:57:29,170
Uh, do you guys ever feel like...

3073
02:57:35,560 --> 02:57:36,700
What is he saying?

3074
02:57:45,260 --> 02:57:46,480
She's calling me.

3075
02:57:57,600 --> 02:57:59,180
Oh my god, why are you calling...

3076
02:58:04,860 --> 02:58:07,040
God, I wish that were me.

3077
02:58:21,990 --> 02:58:23,450
Oh my god, scary.

3078
02:58:25,010 --> 02:58:26,450
This game is making me go insane.

3079
02:58:27,130 --> 02:58:27,730
Seriously.

3080
02:58:28,370 --> 02:58:29,910
Oh my gosh.

3081
02:58:30,150 --> 02:58:32,590
Oh my gosh, a little person crawling away.

3082
02:58:36,030 --> 02:58:37,510
Not on my watch.

3083
02:58:42,050 --> 02:58:43,610
Please what?

3084
02:58:44,730 --> 02:58:45,050
No?

3085
02:58:47,890 --> 02:58:48,800
Well, I was...

3086
02:58:50,910 --> 02:58:52,270
I'm going mad.

3087
02:58:54,830 --> 02:59:01,470
Um, I was saying though, I always feel like more in the spirit of the holiday.

3088
02:59:01,970 --> 02:59:05,570
Like the days leading up to the holiday and never on the holiday itself.

3089
02:59:05,950 --> 02:59:06,830
Isn't that kind of weird though?

3090
02:59:06,910 --> 02:59:11,790
Like I always feel so Halloween-y and then like on Halloween, I'm like, cool.

3091
02:59:12,390 --> 02:59:15,950
And then I don't, but I don't feel the same.

3092
02:59:16,770 --> 02:59:17,930
Maybe Halloween, I don't know.

3093
02:59:18,070 --> 02:59:19,710
Like I feel that very much with Christmas.

3094
02:59:20,270 --> 02:59:22,490
Like I feel that so much with Christmas.

3095
02:59:23,050 --> 02:59:26,210
Like I feel like I'm like, oh my gosh, it's Christmas time.

3096
02:59:26,790 --> 02:59:37,870
Maybe because like I'm going out and I'm like enjoying the Christmas decorations and I'm like going to the stores and they're playing the Christmas music and then on Christmas day, I'm just home.

3097
02:59:40,850 --> 02:59:44,910
During your acid trip, you went nuts and ripped through the cultists like you were Doomguy.

3098
02:59:45,350 --> 02:59:45,890
Pretty metal.

3099
02:59:45,970 --> 02:59:48,090
I'm Gray Fox, I think, probably.

3100
02:59:48,850 --> 02:59:49,970
This is, Gray Fox was here.

3101
02:59:50,090 --> 02:59:51,630
This is actually a Metal Gear reference.

3102
02:59:52,330 --> 02:59:55,470
When it comes time for the real scares, you're just a regular weenie.

3103
02:59:55,610 --> 02:59:56,410
No, I'm not.

3104
02:59:56,570 --> 02:59:58,630
I've been so brave this whole streak.

3105
03:00:01,370 --> 03:00:02,070
I think.

3106
03:00:04,830 --> 03:00:05,630
Up the middle.

3107
03:00:09,190 --> 03:00:11,950
Celebrations wise, it's the eve, that's the bulk of the celebration.

3108
03:00:12,070 --> 03:00:13,810
True, yeah, even that, right?

3109
03:00:14,550 --> 03:00:15,550
What do I put in here?

3110
03:00:17,890 --> 03:00:18,390
Okay.

3111
03:00:19,590 --> 03:00:20,510
Very cool.

3112
03:00:23,990 --> 03:00:24,870
Oh, save.

3113
03:00:26,930 --> 03:00:27,430
Yippee.

3114
03:00:28,150 --> 03:00:28,930
Oh my god.

3115
03:00:29,890 --> 03:00:31,530
Guys, is it time?

3116
03:00:33,470 --> 03:00:34,470
Filthier Acolyte.

3117
03:00:34,470 --> 03:00:39,330
The substance of Gary's influence flows through your veins.

3118
03:00:39,610 --> 03:00:42,890
You are corrupted beyond repair.

3119
03:00:43,890 --> 03:00:46,670
Your family and friends have forsaken you.

3120
03:00:47,570 --> 03:00:51,390
There is no returning from the path you have chosen.

3121
03:00:52,050 --> 03:00:52,350
Woo!

3122
03:00:53,090 --> 03:00:55,530
Oh my gosh, you're just with your sisters.

3123
03:00:55,750 --> 03:00:56,170
Oh my gosh.

3124
03:00:56,730 --> 03:00:59,030
Only Gary can save you now.

3125
03:00:59,430 --> 03:01:02,450
Give up and fully let him into your heart and mind.

3126
03:01:02,830 --> 03:01:08,750
And if you do so, he will make you into a vessel worthy of the unspeakable.

3127
03:01:09,410 --> 03:01:12,670
Resist and your soul will be, like, lost forever or something.

3128
03:01:13,090 --> 03:01:14,350
Welcome to Tier 3.

3129
03:01:14,950 --> 03:01:16,530
Gary loves you.

3130
03:01:21,890 --> 03:01:24,590
Oh, is this the mom painting?

3131
03:01:25,150 --> 03:01:25,490
Oh gosh.

3132
03:01:27,950 --> 03:01:29,630
Just keep going.

3133
03:01:32,430 --> 03:01:34,050
Oh, okay.

3134
03:01:34,330 --> 03:01:37,390
We're in, like, a real maze now.

3135
03:01:38,730 --> 03:01:39,410
Okay.

3136
03:01:40,250 --> 03:01:42,050
Oh, that's kind of icky.

3137
03:01:43,090 --> 03:01:44,950
All right, let's just keep walking.

3138
03:01:46,670 --> 03:01:48,290
Let's just keep exploring.

3139
03:01:48,950 --> 03:01:50,390
What is that?

3140
03:01:51,270 --> 03:01:52,770
It's a bull.

3141
03:01:55,270 --> 03:01:56,690
What did I grab?

3142
03:01:57,370 --> 03:01:58,630
Clavis-el?

3143
03:01:58,790 --> 03:01:59,670
What does that mean?

3144
03:02:00,850 --> 03:02:02,410
What did I touch?

3145
03:02:03,090 --> 03:02:04,390
What did I grab?

3146
03:02:04,850 --> 03:02:06,290
I don't know.

3147
03:02:08,790 --> 03:02:10,070
I'm just taking...

3148
03:02:15,690 --> 03:02:18,350
Uh, how'd you do that?

3149
03:02:20,050 --> 03:02:22,830
Why am I questioning what's anything in this anymore?

3150
03:02:25,050 --> 03:02:28,110
Oh, uh-oh.

3151
03:02:28,330 --> 03:02:29,150
It's a loopy room.

3152
03:02:32,860 --> 03:02:34,100
Is it gonna happen again?

3153
03:02:34,600 --> 03:02:34,900
Yeah.

3154
03:02:42,100 --> 03:02:44,860
Try and check the painting multiple times for the good ending.

3155
03:02:45,040 --> 03:02:45,740
Oh, thank you.

3156
03:02:48,520 --> 03:02:49,080
Okay.

3157
03:02:53,020 --> 03:02:53,980
All right.

3158
03:02:56,740 --> 03:02:57,200
Take it.

3159
03:02:57,200 --> 03:02:57,340
Take it.

3160
03:02:57,980 --> 03:02:58,400
Okay.

3161
03:03:05,360 --> 03:03:06,920
What are you guys doing?

3162
03:03:08,360 --> 03:03:09,760
What are you guys doing?

3163
03:03:09,960 --> 03:03:12,540
Okay, if I just stare at the wall, will you do something else?

3164
03:03:28,560 --> 03:03:29,360
Yeah.

3165
03:03:30,740 --> 03:03:32,360
Just gonna keep going.

3166
03:03:33,840 --> 03:03:35,340
Oh god, there's a child!

3167
03:03:53,940 --> 03:03:54,840
I got him.

3168
03:03:55,460 --> 03:03:56,320
I killed the child.

3169
03:04:04,260 --> 03:04:05,060
Cool.

3170
03:04:05,380 --> 03:04:05,600
Anything?

3171
03:04:06,100 --> 03:04:06,400
Okay.

3172
03:04:07,980 --> 03:04:09,460
Child slain.

3173
03:04:10,160 --> 03:04:11,560
So check the painting.

3174
03:04:25,270 --> 03:04:26,910
Oh wait, let's go save real quick.

3175
03:04:27,650 --> 03:04:28,430
You need to go save.

3176
03:04:28,550 --> 03:04:29,890
Yeah, I was about to go.

3177
03:04:34,490 --> 03:04:35,370
Oh goodness.

3178
03:04:37,370 --> 03:04:38,590
Hold on, guys.

3179
03:04:38,670 --> 03:04:40,230
I gotta save first before the painting.

3180
03:04:42,710 --> 03:04:44,790
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3181
03:04:45,390 --> 03:04:46,890
Boss, you killed a child.

3182
03:04:46,890 --> 03:04:47,190
Oh no.

3183
03:05:01,440 --> 03:05:02,460
He'll appear.

3184
03:05:04,400 --> 03:05:05,820
Oh, who's him?

3185
03:05:09,390 --> 03:05:10,510
Who's him?

3186
03:05:20,200 --> 03:05:21,780
Say his name and he appears.

3187
03:05:24,660 --> 03:05:25,540
Gordon Ramsay.

3188
03:05:27,840 --> 03:05:30,100
You can move?

3189
03:05:30,200 --> 03:05:30,440
Okay.

3190
03:05:31,840 --> 03:05:32,720
I'm leaving.

3191
03:05:33,360 --> 03:05:34,680
I'm out of here.

3192
03:05:36,400 --> 03:05:38,820
Oh, is this who you're talking about?

3193
03:05:47,380 --> 03:05:48,020
Rebel.

3194
03:05:48,240 --> 03:05:48,900
Oh goodness.

3195
03:05:54,890 --> 03:05:56,530
Oh my god, he's fast.

3196
03:05:57,510 --> 03:05:58,510
He's really fast.

3197
03:06:00,890 --> 03:06:03,230
Can I even save like in this kind of area?

3198
03:06:05,570 --> 03:06:06,570
Oh my god.

3199
03:06:07,210 --> 03:06:08,890
Oh my god, Mr. Meat.

3200
03:06:09,910 --> 03:06:10,830
Oh, Mr. Meat.

3201
03:06:20,870 --> 03:06:22,110
Mr. Meat!

3202
03:06:23,470 --> 03:06:24,590
Mr. Meat!

3203
03:06:27,070 --> 03:06:28,350
Where does he come from?

3204
03:06:29,350 --> 03:06:30,510
Mr. Meat!

3205
03:06:31,590 --> 03:06:32,950
He has a lot of health?

3206
03:06:33,010 --> 03:06:33,290
Okay.

3207
03:06:34,650 --> 03:06:36,330
We'll just keep chipping away at it.

3208
03:06:37,510 --> 03:06:39,890
We'll just keep on chipping, chipping.

3209
03:06:41,310 --> 03:06:42,270
Oh my god.

3210
03:06:45,690 --> 03:06:46,970
Whatever I can get.

3211
03:06:48,270 --> 03:06:52,930
This room seems pretty not bad to get him in.

3212
03:06:55,190 --> 03:06:56,310
Oh my god.

3213
03:07:00,970 --> 03:07:02,410
Mr. Meat!

3214
03:07:02,410 --> 03:07:02,630
Mr. Meat!

3215
03:07:07,310 --> 03:07:07,990
Oh my god.

3216
03:07:08,690 --> 03:07:10,070
Oh, I got greedy.

3217
03:07:10,210 --> 03:07:10,650
I got greedy.

3218
03:07:20,800 --> 03:07:21,780
We got him?

3219
03:07:26,520 --> 03:07:27,680
Oh my god!

3220
03:07:30,030 --> 03:07:31,510
You guys, we did it!

3221
03:07:31,550 --> 03:07:31,930
We did it!

3222
03:07:31,950 --> 03:07:32,350
We did it!

3223
03:07:32,370 --> 03:07:32,910
We did it!

3224
03:07:33,930 --> 03:07:34,330
We did it!

3225
03:07:37,530 --> 03:07:38,330
Let's go!

3226
03:07:40,390 --> 03:07:42,450
Now we can get the good end.

3227
03:07:43,370 --> 03:07:45,030
What else is over here anyway?

3228
03:07:48,840 --> 03:07:49,540
Good job, Minto!

3229
03:07:49,720 --> 03:07:50,200
Thank you!

3230
03:07:50,960 --> 03:07:52,340
That'll be my first time ever seeing.

3231
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:54,600
Congrats on beating the Unholy Spirit.

3232
03:07:54,700 --> 03:07:56,360
Definitely the weirdest of the three hidden bosses.

3233
03:07:57,020 --> 03:07:58,700
At least you can now finish what you started.

3234
03:08:00,260 --> 03:08:00,620
Yeah.

3235
03:08:01,460 --> 03:08:02,160
Thank you!

3236
03:08:02,860 --> 03:08:03,500
Thanks, villain.

3237
03:08:03,740 --> 03:08:04,540
Thanks for the super chat.

3238
03:08:10,740 --> 03:08:11,100
Okay.

3239
03:08:21,220 --> 03:08:22,500
God, this area is huge.

3240
03:08:25,460 --> 03:08:28,180
I think you just don't go into that hole and waste all the effort.

3241
03:08:28,400 --> 03:08:29,360
You put it... Wait, what hole?

3242
03:08:32,560 --> 03:08:33,620
Wait, where the heck am I?

3243
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:38,900
Oh, this is... Okay, it's a big old circle.

3244
03:08:40,820 --> 03:08:42,960
Does anything happen with this painting too?

3245
03:08:45,400 --> 03:08:46,000
Oh,

3246
03:08:56,920 --> 03:09:00,800
not this guy again.

3247
03:09:06,220 --> 03:09:06,860
Oopsie.

3248
03:09:08,460 --> 03:09:15,400
He didn't give me enough time, enough space to get away from him.

3249
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:16,760
Oh, there we go.

3250
03:09:23,480 --> 03:09:24,560
Die, baby!

3251
03:09:24,900 --> 03:09:25,860
Die, little baby!

3252
03:09:30,440 --> 03:09:33,120
I tried to move away from him.

3253
03:09:33,380 --> 03:09:33,960
I'm silly.

3254
03:09:38,980 --> 03:09:40,180
He's eating on me.

3255
03:09:53,440 --> 03:09:54,160
Oh my god.

3256
03:10:00,520 --> 03:10:02,160
Can I just avoid this?

3257
03:10:02,220 --> 03:10:03,480
Can I just walk around this guy?

3258
03:10:13,900 --> 03:10:15,260
I think I can kill him though.

3259
03:10:16,440 --> 03:10:17,040
There we go.

3260
03:10:20,180 --> 03:10:23,600
Splat, splat, splat, splat, splat, splat, splat, splat, splat, splat, splat.

3261
03:10:27,100 --> 03:10:29,080
Let's play red light, green light.

3262
03:10:29,080 --> 03:10:29,480
Oh.

3263
03:10:48,520 --> 03:10:49,520
I'm scared.

3264
03:10:50,580 --> 03:10:52,280
Ah, squid game, yeah.

3265
03:10:57,740 --> 03:11:00,960
Oh, this is messed up.

3266
03:11:07,520 --> 03:11:09,880
That's so messed up!

3267
03:11:10,320 --> 03:11:11,140
Okay, okay.

3268
03:11:11,400 --> 03:11:13,760
I thought I could like kill that guy.

3269
03:11:13,920 --> 03:11:14,420
I guess not.

3270
03:11:15,640 --> 03:11:17,960
Okay, oh I'm all the way back here.

3271
03:11:18,460 --> 03:11:20,120
Okay, I'm just gonna avoid this guy.

3272
03:11:22,820 --> 03:11:23,680
See ya, baby.

3273
03:11:37,140 --> 03:11:38,060
What if I...

3274
03:11:41,120 --> 03:11:44,380
Okay, go back to your hidey hole, lady.

3275
03:11:44,500 --> 03:11:44,940
Come on.

3276
03:11:47,020 --> 03:11:47,660
Green light.

3277
03:11:55,570 --> 03:11:57,230
Fine, fine.

3278
03:11:58,250 --> 03:11:59,130
Green light.

3279
03:12:03,270 --> 03:12:03,990
Green light.

3280
03:12:10,510 --> 03:12:11,350
Green light.

3281
03:12:12,010 --> 03:12:13,050
Wait, is this thing already coming in?

3282
03:12:13,250 --> 03:12:13,470
No.

3283
03:12:26,680 --> 03:12:28,120
There's two of them now.

3284
03:12:37,820 --> 03:12:38,700
I just...

3285
03:12:43,670 --> 03:12:44,190
Uh...

3286
03:12:51,970 --> 03:12:54,870
It puts me all the way back here.

3287
03:12:55,010 --> 03:13:01,410
Oh gosh, I wonder if I can try fighting one at a time.

3288
03:13:06,170 --> 03:13:09,310
I can kind of take it easy with the first part.

3289
03:13:12,110 --> 03:13:13,610
Oh, that was close.

3290
03:13:26,990 --> 03:13:27,990
Okay,

3291
03:13:31,820 --> 03:13:33,520
hopefully they trigger separately.

3292
03:13:41,710 --> 03:13:44,270
Oh my gosh, it's gonna come after me!

3293
03:13:44,770 --> 03:13:47,190
Oh my gosh, I almost didn't get away.

3294
03:13:47,770 --> 03:13:49,250
I almost didn't get away.

3295
03:13:50,910 --> 03:13:52,510
Die, die, die!

3296
03:13:53,530 --> 03:13:55,410
Okay, we got him.

3297
03:13:55,630 --> 03:13:56,790
Little splatty man.

3298
03:13:57,070 --> 03:13:58,590
Okay, now we can escape.

3299
03:14:00,770 --> 03:14:02,490
Now we can go save.

3300
03:14:03,350 --> 03:14:04,270
Easy peasy.

3301
03:14:04,850 --> 03:14:06,170
Easy peasy.

3302
03:14:07,250 --> 03:14:08,790
What's gonna happen here?

3303
03:14:09,130 --> 03:14:10,610
Oh, it looks the same actually.

3304
03:14:10,790 --> 03:14:11,190
Never mind.

3305
03:14:12,350 --> 03:14:14,750
Not nearly as interesting as the last painting.

3306
03:14:16,350 --> 03:14:16,950
Okay.

3307
03:14:18,330 --> 03:14:22,430
All right, we grabbed Clavis R.

3308
03:14:23,330 --> 03:14:24,230
Wait a second.

3309
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:32,320
Is it this?

3310
03:14:38,320 --> 03:14:38,920
What

3311
03:14:42,020 --> 03:14:43,440
about the other room?

3312
03:14:44,360 --> 03:14:45,700
You never explored all the way north.

3313
03:14:45,800 --> 03:14:46,460
I didn't.

3314
03:14:46,460 --> 03:14:48,000
Do I have to go all the way north?

3315
03:14:51,540 --> 03:14:52,840
Or do I need a key?

3316
03:14:53,980 --> 03:14:59,860
Oh, deliver two into Moloch's hands before opening his navel.

3317
03:15:00,600 --> 03:15:01,580
I did that.

3318
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:05,120
I did that.

3319
03:15:08,680 --> 03:15:09,840
Open up, navel.

3320
03:15:11,640 --> 03:15:12,500
What do you need?

3321
03:15:12,520 --> 03:15:15,280
Like a little key that goes into your tum-tum?

3322
03:15:15,380 --> 03:15:16,320
What do you want from me?

3323
03:15:16,920 --> 03:15:18,080
Still gotta go north.

3324
03:15:18,140 --> 03:15:22,720
Okay, I'm trying to speed run.

3325
03:15:22,940 --> 03:15:24,560
I'm trying to speed run here.

3326
03:15:25,760 --> 03:15:26,620
Touch stummy.

3327
03:15:29,020 --> 03:15:30,500
Touch fluffy tail.

3328
03:15:33,580 --> 03:15:34,820
Okay, all right.

3329
03:15:35,400 --> 03:15:36,980
These guys in their cages.

3330
03:15:40,480 --> 03:15:42,540
Oh, let's just go north.

3331
03:15:43,840 --> 03:15:44,780
Let's go.

3332
03:15:47,580 --> 03:15:48,980
Oh, I don't know.

3333
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:51,540
What the hell is this?

3334
03:15:52,440 --> 03:15:53,360
Oh, it's a mirror.

3335
03:16:00,140 --> 03:16:01,260
Oh, don't like that.

3336
03:16:01,480 --> 03:16:02,380
Oh, don't like that.

3337
03:16:02,540 --> 03:16:03,100
Don't like that.

3338
03:16:03,200 --> 03:16:03,640
Don't like that.

3339
03:16:03,740 --> 03:16:04,200
Don't like that.

3340
03:16:11,910 --> 03:16:13,390
Oh, I just...

3341
03:16:16,730 --> 03:16:19,070
Mental monster girl quest enjoyer.

3342
03:16:19,170 --> 03:16:22,230
Yeah, of course.

3343
03:16:24,350 --> 03:16:26,190
Though, I haven't played the third one.

3344
03:16:26,310 --> 03:16:27,090
I'm a fake fan.

3345
03:16:27,250 --> 03:16:30,070
But, okay, to be fair, the third one was not out when I played.

3346
03:16:30,370 --> 03:16:30,590
Okay.

3347
03:16:35,520 --> 03:16:36,680
Oh my goodness.

3348
03:16:47,280 --> 03:16:49,120
Hmm, I don't like this part.

3349
03:16:50,380 --> 03:16:51,180
Oh my gosh.

3350
03:16:52,700 --> 03:16:53,820
Oh, he's really ugly.

3351
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:54,460
Oh my gosh.

3352
03:16:54,520 --> 03:16:56,100
Wait, it's confusing the hell out of me.

3353
03:17:00,040 --> 03:17:01,780
I don't like this part.

3354
03:17:02,260 --> 03:17:03,580
I don't like this part.

3355
03:17:03,860 --> 03:17:05,280
I don't like this part.

3356
03:17:13,030 --> 03:17:17,190
Okay, uh, this part confuses me.

3357
03:17:19,770 --> 03:17:21,850
Okay, so he's like right there.

3358
03:17:22,150 --> 03:17:23,930
He's like, oh my gosh, where are you?

3359
03:17:24,890 --> 03:17:25,910
Wait, where are you?

3360
03:17:26,030 --> 03:17:26,730
Where are you?

3361
03:17:26,870 --> 03:17:27,650
I can't tell.

3362
03:17:27,810 --> 03:17:28,610
I can't tell.

3363
03:17:28,930 --> 03:17:29,410
You guys.

3364
03:17:31,170 --> 03:17:32,070
Oh my gosh.

3365
03:17:47,340 --> 03:17:49,100
Part three is the best one.

3366
03:17:49,200 --> 03:17:50,340
I know I gotta play it.

3367
03:17:50,640 --> 03:17:52,000
I've been saying that for years though.

3368
03:17:53,880 --> 03:17:55,840
Guys, I can't do this.

3369
03:17:56,440 --> 03:17:58,900
This is like actually the final boss for me.

3370
03:18:02,100 --> 03:18:03,140
More tits.

3371
03:18:03,400 --> 03:18:04,680
What the hell does that mean?

3372
03:18:07,380 --> 03:18:08,360
Oh my gosh.

3373
03:18:08,920 --> 03:18:11,940
Okay, so he's like right in front of me.

3374
03:18:12,320 --> 03:18:12,800
Oh my gosh.

3375
03:18:19,010 --> 03:18:20,950
Oh my gosh, he teleports.

3376
03:18:21,130 --> 03:18:22,310
Please don't do that.

3377
03:18:22,530 --> 03:18:22,910
Please.

3378
03:18:23,130 --> 03:18:24,890
I can't tell where you are at all.

3379
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:30,440
I can't tell where you are.

3380
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:32,580
Oh my god, he's coming.

3381
03:18:32,900 --> 03:18:34,940
Ah, wait, oh, okay.

3382
03:18:49,060 --> 03:18:50,460
He's right in front of me.

3383
03:18:50,700 --> 03:18:51,180
Where isn't he?

3384
03:18:52,020 --> 03:18:53,060
Oh my gosh.

3385
03:18:55,080 --> 03:18:58,340
I don't understand what the mirror does either.

3386
03:18:58,600 --> 03:19:02,320
I guess, I guess, oh, it can't be covered or else I can't see him.

3387
03:19:02,520 --> 03:19:03,380
Okay, never mind.

3388
03:19:04,340 --> 03:19:05,040
I get it.

3389
03:19:05,120 --> 03:19:05,880
I get it.

3390
03:19:05,980 --> 03:19:09,300
It can't be covered or else I can't see him.

3391
03:19:09,700 --> 03:19:11,800
If I can't see him, I can't attack him.

3392
03:19:12,220 --> 03:19:14,480
Oh my gosh, he's like right on me.

3393
03:19:21,040 --> 03:19:22,060
Oh my god, wait.

3394
03:19:22,060 --> 03:19:23,060
Uh, uh.

3395
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:31,180
Should I cross the mask?

3396
03:19:31,680 --> 03:19:32,500
Wait, what is that?

3397
03:19:34,060 --> 03:19:34,900
Oh,

3398
03:19:42,060 --> 03:19:43,920
I hate this one.

3399
03:19:45,360 --> 03:19:48,120
How do I get the dang mask?

3400
03:19:50,780 --> 03:19:52,680
Okay, he's like right there.

3401
03:19:53,220 --> 03:19:55,460
So, I should be able to attack him or not.

3402
03:19:55,640 --> 03:19:57,260
Why am I not attacking him?

3403
03:20:00,500 --> 03:20:01,820
And he teleports.

3404
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:02,900
Oh, this is so hot.

3405
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:04,800
This is, you guys, oh my gosh.

3406
03:20:05,860 --> 03:20:06,700
Please, please.

3407
03:20:09,700 --> 03:20:10,940
I'm so confused.

3408
03:20:12,120 --> 03:20:13,120
He's gonna kill me.

3409
03:20:13,300 --> 03:20:14,260
Oh no, I'm good.

3410
03:20:14,960 --> 03:20:16,460
I don't get it at all.

3411
03:20:17,040 --> 03:20:18,360
What do you mean you get it?

3412
03:20:18,420 --> 03:20:19,340
I don't get it.

3413
03:20:27,100 --> 03:20:28,740
Please don't kill me, mister.

3414
03:20:34,950 --> 03:20:36,250
I don't know which way to go.

3415
03:20:36,510 --> 03:20:37,070
Oh, okay, okay.

3416
03:20:39,950 --> 03:20:40,350
Please.

3417
03:20:41,090 --> 03:20:41,970
Death, death, death.

3418
03:20:42,490 --> 03:20:43,170
Die, die, die.

3419
03:20:47,140 --> 03:20:48,620
Oh my gosh, I finally did it.

3420
03:20:50,460 --> 03:20:52,480
Oh my gosh, I finally did it.

3421
03:20:53,560 --> 03:20:53,960
Yippee!

3422
03:20:54,160 --> 03:20:55,200
Okay, let's get out of here.

3423
03:21:00,420 --> 03:21:01,620
Don't open up.

3424
03:21:02,020 --> 03:21:03,580
Just let me leave in peace, please.

3425
03:21:04,960 --> 03:21:06,880
I got the thing for the navel.

3426
03:21:07,580 --> 03:21:08,720
The navel face.

3427
03:21:09,180 --> 03:21:09,900
What is this even called?

3428
03:21:10,040 --> 03:21:11,600
It's called the navel.

3429
03:21:14,580 --> 03:21:17,580
I was just kidding, but it actually is.

3430
03:21:20,380 --> 03:21:20,900
Okay.

3431
03:21:22,960 --> 03:21:25,320
I don't even know how close we are to beating the game.

3432
03:21:29,460 --> 03:21:31,140
Congrats on beating your personal demon.

3433
03:21:32,920 --> 03:21:35,020
I don't need a mirror, you guys.

3434
03:21:35,540 --> 03:21:36,240
I'm a ghost.

3435
03:21:37,900 --> 03:21:38,860
Very close.

3436
03:21:39,020 --> 03:21:39,520
Yippee!

3437
03:21:40,840 --> 03:21:42,380
All right, navel time.

3438
03:21:44,560 --> 03:21:45,300
Oh.

3439
03:21:50,320 --> 03:21:52,420
Go into the belly of the beast.

3440
03:21:53,660 --> 03:21:55,100
Diving in too deep.

3441
03:21:56,780 --> 03:21:57,520
Master.

3442
03:21:57,900 --> 03:21:58,960
Hold on.

3443
03:21:59,700 --> 03:22:07,140
Master of spirits, the body of the mother stayeth suspended beneath the crucible of the profane Sabbath.

3444
03:22:07,780 --> 03:22:12,200
If thou can't unlock the final secret of the crucible, know ye this.

3445
03:22:12,700 --> 03:22:21,700
The cross hath the power to weaken the mother, but only someone who is ablaze with purifying fire can't truly destroy her.

3446
03:22:22,140 --> 03:22:27,120
If thou can't understand these words, thou shalt know the true cost of thy faith.

3447
03:22:28,540 --> 03:22:28,800
Okay.

3448
03:22:30,940 --> 03:22:31,660
Sorority.

3449
03:22:31,800 --> 03:22:33,380
Sorority cult is my favorite.

3450
03:22:34,740 --> 03:22:37,200
Oh, do you like the spooky face?

3451
03:22:38,420 --> 03:22:39,600
Or the happy face?

3452
03:22:42,340 --> 03:22:46,720
You are now a tier 4 acolyte.

3453
03:22:46,860 --> 03:22:47,440
Oh my gosh.

3454
03:22:47,840 --> 03:22:49,160
Congratulations, girlfriend!

3455
03:22:50,180 --> 03:22:54,820
You have descended beyond everything that could possibly save you.

3456
03:22:55,260 --> 03:22:55,920
Crazy.

3457
03:22:56,380 --> 03:23:00,560
Your words are not your own, and your actions are not your own.

3458
03:23:00,680 --> 03:23:05,040
You belong, body and spirit, to Gary.

3459
03:23:05,880 --> 03:23:06,660
Oh my god.

3460
03:23:08,100 --> 03:23:12,700
Your face itches for the warm embrace of the ritual mask.

3461
03:23:13,100 --> 03:23:16,320
You long for the blinding pain of the knife.

3462
03:23:16,960 --> 03:23:18,740
You truly are Gary's chosen vessel.

3463
03:23:20,400 --> 03:23:21,460
Fear not.

3464
03:23:21,760 --> 03:23:25,460
Only a little longer and you will experience the second death.

3465
03:23:25,840 --> 03:23:27,740
Adios, alma perdita.

3466
03:23:28,380 --> 03:23:29,400
Gary loves you.

3467
03:23:34,240 --> 03:23:35,940
Partake of the dark.

3468
03:23:38,740 --> 03:23:40,040
Oh, what's this way?

3469
03:23:43,060 --> 03:23:46,060
Oh, uh, wait.

3470
03:23:47,280 --> 03:23:47,560
Huh?

3471
03:23:49,480 --> 03:23:51,620
Wait, what if I actually go up?

3472
03:23:54,870 --> 03:23:56,570
What if I go into the dark?

3473
03:23:59,690 --> 03:24:00,210
Okay.

3474
03:24:09,090 --> 03:24:11,830
I partook... wait, is there a way to avoid that?

3475
03:24:11,990 --> 03:24:13,590
Okay, let's just go on then.

3476
03:24:14,210 --> 03:24:15,290
There's your answer.

3477
03:24:17,030 --> 03:24:18,230
Just death, death,

3478
03:24:22,220 --> 03:24:22,740
death.

3479
03:24:22,740 --> 03:24:23,840
Everywhere we look.

3480
03:24:23,980 --> 03:24:26,140
Death, death, death, death, death.

3481
03:24:26,160 --> 03:24:27,440
Oh my goodness.

3482
03:24:27,540 --> 03:24:31,020
Okay, I think I need to keep going or else the darkness will consume me.

3483
03:24:33,140 --> 03:24:35,380
I think I need to go further.

3484
03:24:35,580 --> 03:24:36,940
Oh no, no.

3485
03:24:37,980 --> 03:24:39,380
The darkness, the darkness.

3486
03:24:42,760 --> 03:24:47,860
Okay, oh, oh, oh, the darkness.

3487
03:24:50,560 --> 03:24:51,480
The darkness.

3488
03:24:52,680 --> 03:24:55,400
Oh gosh, eternal darkness.

3489
03:24:56,100 --> 03:24:58,680
Oh, oh, oh gosh, I don't like this.

3490
03:25:02,120 --> 03:25:04,100
I think I made it to the bottom.

3491
03:25:05,200 --> 03:25:05,820
Oh, okay, good.

3492
03:25:08,360 --> 03:25:09,860
Oh, I don't like this.

3493
03:25:11,700 --> 03:25:14,600
Oh, now I can go back up through the tunnel.

3494
03:25:15,080 --> 03:25:15,360
Okay.

3495
03:25:17,860 --> 03:25:19,240
What is, what is there?

3496
03:25:19,900 --> 03:25:20,880
What is that sound?

3497
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:24,780
What is, oh my gosh.

3498
03:25:26,540 --> 03:25:28,780
Gary, not Gary?

3499
03:25:39,410 --> 03:25:41,830
Oh my gosh, it's purple guy.

3500
03:25:43,110 --> 03:25:44,430
Purple guy real.

3501
03:25:45,410 --> 03:25:48,010
Um, which direction was the correct way?

3502
03:25:48,010 --> 03:25:51,650
Uh, do I, I guess I go, oh, I go up?

3503
03:25:55,170 --> 03:25:57,570
Literally, oh my gosh, again.

3504
03:25:58,070 --> 03:25:59,570
You can't get me with the same thing.

3505
03:26:01,630 --> 03:26:02,550
Purple guy.

3506
03:26:04,350 --> 03:26:06,910
Oh gosh, William Afton, that's his name.

3507
03:26:07,770 --> 03:26:08,750
I'm gonna go around.

3508
03:26:09,570 --> 03:26:16,970
Oh my gosh, Matara's stinking twitch, I mean, uh, steam notification spooked me.

3509
03:26:18,450 --> 03:26:20,530
Why are there so many birds in here?

3510
03:26:20,690 --> 03:26:21,470
Aren't we underground?

3511
03:26:24,570 --> 03:26:25,890
I don't like that.

3512
03:26:27,610 --> 03:26:29,370
I don't like that at all.

3513
03:26:31,410 --> 03:26:37,370
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh golly gosh.

3514
03:26:37,590 --> 03:26:38,850
Oh, oh, we're outside.

3515
03:26:40,470 --> 03:26:42,070
When did we get out here?

3516
03:26:42,650 --> 03:26:44,610
Okay, I'm gonna follow the little lines.

3517
03:26:45,510 --> 03:26:49,390
Oh wow, wait, isn't this the thing I undid?

3518
03:26:50,770 --> 03:26:53,630
Isn't this the seal that I got rid of?

3519
03:26:58,900 --> 03:26:59,780
Different one?

3520
03:26:59,900 --> 03:27:00,940
Oh, they all look the same.

3521
03:27:01,620 --> 03:27:03,660
Oh my god, oh, that was so close.

3522
03:27:05,080 --> 03:27:06,740
They all look the same to me.

3523
03:27:10,840 --> 03:27:12,240
Um, I think I'm lost.

3524
03:27:12,540 --> 03:27:14,080
Okay, uh, oh, there we go.

3525
03:27:14,980 --> 03:27:22,420
Follow the little things to the holy light.

3526
03:27:23,720 --> 03:27:32,360
Except it's kind of unholy since this game is not about being, well, it's actually all about being holy.

3527
03:27:33,820 --> 03:27:37,480
But sometimes it's a little unholy.

3528
03:27:37,680 --> 03:27:41,760
Oh god, oh shoot, oh my god.

3529
03:27:43,560 --> 03:27:48,600
No, girl, I don't want to join your sorority today.

3530
03:27:50,180 --> 03:27:51,140
Oh.

3531
03:27:52,880 --> 03:27:54,660
Oh, I found one.

3532
03:27:58,640 --> 03:27:59,740
Oh, oh, okay.

3533
03:28:00,920 --> 03:28:02,440
Gotta go back.

3534
03:28:04,760 --> 03:28:07,700
To the... oh gosh, I'm lost.

3535
03:28:07,700 --> 03:28:11,860
Um, I'm really lost.

3536
03:28:11,980 --> 03:28:16,040
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot the person.

3537
03:28:16,380 --> 03:28:19,280
Oh, father, why didn't you bring a gun?

3538
03:28:21,840 --> 03:28:26,040
Con Gary, Con Gary, virtual demon Gary-desu.

3539
03:28:26,480 --> 03:28:28,000
Remember, Gary loves you.

3540
03:28:31,060 --> 03:28:34,500
Gary, kimi no koto suki.

3541
03:28:39,670 --> 03:28:41,450
Okay, we found one girl.

3542
03:28:42,050 --> 03:28:44,770
I don't know which direction she was from.

3543
03:28:45,890 --> 03:28:47,890
The one direction, maybe.

3544
03:28:48,910 --> 03:28:54,230
Oh god, how am I supposed to know which direction I found?

3545
03:28:58,030 --> 03:28:59,990
She was left, okay.

3546
03:29:00,950 --> 03:29:04,270
But I like went, oh my gosh, I went like everywhere though.

3547
03:29:05,110 --> 03:29:07,450
Summer, we're so glad you're finally here.

3548
03:29:07,590 --> 03:29:08,310
Thank you.

3549
03:29:10,070 --> 03:29:12,590
Oh, oh, the sorority girlies.

3550
03:29:13,350 --> 03:29:15,650
We've been waiting all summer.

3551
03:29:17,470 --> 03:29:21,010
Oh, oh, I think I found it.

3552
03:29:21,330 --> 03:29:23,870
Wait, I found a house.

3553
03:29:24,810 --> 03:29:25,470
What does it say?

3554
03:29:28,990 --> 03:29:31,070
This requires a demon voice.

3555
03:29:33,410 --> 03:29:35,570
My dearest colleague, Jacob.

3556
03:29:35,930 --> 03:29:37,210
Thank you for the letter.

3557
03:29:37,670 --> 03:29:41,470
I am delighted to hear of the success of your venture in Pennsylvania.

3558
03:29:42,450 --> 03:29:46,130
However, it was not enough to persuade me to join your cause.

3559
03:29:46,470 --> 03:29:56,750
I have no interest in crumbling ghost towns, nor government experiments, nor the gibbering behemoths that lurk shamefully in the darkness between worlds.

3560
03:29:57,190 --> 03:29:59,570
Such matters are not worthy of my expertise.

3561
03:30:01,070 --> 03:30:08,430
My methods may be more delicate than yours, but I assure you they were given to me straight from the source.

3562
03:30:09,390 --> 03:30:12,430
The Antichrist will step forth very soon.

3563
03:30:12,930 --> 03:30:15,810
The second death will consume this world.

3564
03:30:17,790 --> 03:30:26,990
This pitiful fleshy sphere will, still in its infancy yet, everlastingly too late to redeem.

3565
03:30:26,990 --> 03:30:35,550
When the time comes, I hope we may reunite as cohorts, albeit not as equals.

3566
03:30:36,070 --> 03:30:37,070
Nope, always!

3567
03:30:37,690 --> 03:30:38,090
Gary!

3568
03:30:38,830 --> 03:30:39,370
P.S.

3569
03:30:39,510 --> 03:30:41,730
I almost forgot to thank you for the pet.

3570
03:30:41,970 --> 03:30:45,750
I will keep it outside my private quarters as a guard against intruders.

3571
03:30:46,970 --> 03:30:47,970
Oh my god, Gary!

3572
03:30:48,570 --> 03:30:49,590
Where was your pet?

3573
03:30:50,970 --> 03:30:51,530
Oh!

3574
03:30:51,710 --> 03:30:52,810
Oh my god, Breaking Bad!

3575
03:30:54,770 --> 03:30:56,110
It's the squad!

3576
03:30:58,130 --> 03:30:59,290
Gary and crew!

3577
03:31:05,500 --> 03:31:06,780
Oh, which one was that?

3578
03:31:07,300 --> 03:31:08,800
Oh god, is that the pet?

3579
03:31:13,620 --> 03:31:14,780
It's kinda weak.

3580
03:31:22,040 --> 03:31:23,600
No girl around here.

3581
03:31:23,780 --> 03:31:25,080
Dang it, I went the wrong way.

3582
03:31:25,560 --> 03:31:27,560
I don't like this part, you guys.

3583
03:31:27,660 --> 03:31:28,740
I don't like this part.

3584
03:31:28,820 --> 03:31:29,600
It's too long.

3585
03:31:34,780 --> 03:31:37,280
It's too long and I don't know where to go.

3586
03:31:37,960 --> 03:31:40,860
I've been following these things and they took me to the wrong place.

3587
03:31:40,940 --> 03:31:42,460
Oh wait, maybe...

3588
03:31:43,820 --> 03:31:44,260
No...

3589
03:31:45,800 --> 03:31:48,300
Maybe I was supposed to go there first.

3590
03:31:50,680 --> 03:31:51,560
Oh gosh.

3591
03:31:52,500 --> 03:31:53,980
They're really close by.

3592
03:31:54,220 --> 03:31:56,140
Okay, it is leading me somewhere else.

3593
03:31:58,120 --> 03:31:58,860
Oh my god!

3594
03:31:58,960 --> 03:31:59,180
Ah!

3595
03:32:02,340 --> 03:32:02,780
Okay...

3596
03:32:03,560 --> 03:32:04,640
I'm following.

3597
03:32:06,140 --> 03:32:07,420
I'm following.

3598
03:32:09,720 --> 03:32:10,260
Okay.

3599
03:32:10,880 --> 03:32:11,700
Too late, sucker.

3600
03:32:17,680 --> 03:32:19,620
Oh gosh.

3601
03:32:20,240 --> 03:32:21,460
Golly, golly, golly.

3602
03:32:22,200 --> 03:32:22,740
Please.

3603
03:32:24,240 --> 03:32:25,580
Oh, we found it!

3604
03:32:26,500 --> 03:32:28,680
Oh, oops.

3605
03:32:32,990 --> 03:32:33,550
Okay.

3606
03:32:34,630 --> 03:32:36,190
Oh, it's gone.

3607
03:32:37,050 --> 03:32:37,610
Nice.

3608
03:32:41,010 --> 03:32:42,690
How do I get home?

3609
03:32:44,590 --> 03:32:45,710
Maybe if I...

3610
03:32:45,710 --> 03:32:46,170
Oh my gosh.

3611
03:32:47,070 --> 03:32:47,630
Golly.

3612
03:32:48,730 --> 03:32:50,990
I don't wanna have to do this part all over again.

3613
03:32:53,390 --> 03:32:54,530
Just go south?

3614
03:32:54,810 --> 03:32:56,130
Oh yeah, because I went north, right?

3615
03:33:05,240 --> 03:33:07,060
I'm going south.

3616
03:33:07,360 --> 03:33:08,220
I'm going south.

3617
03:33:09,380 --> 03:33:10,540
For winter...

3618
03:33:11,170 --> 03:33:12,660
I went too far south!

3619
03:33:15,000 --> 03:33:15,580
Guys...

3620
03:33:15,580 --> 03:33:16,520
Oh shoot.

3621
03:33:17,520 --> 03:33:18,900
No, no way, no way.

3622
03:33:18,940 --> 03:33:20,060
I found it on accident!

3623
03:33:26,990 --> 03:33:27,940
Is she still there?

3624
03:33:28,260 --> 03:33:28,640
You think?

3625
03:33:41,320 --> 03:33:41,900
Nice.

3626
03:33:42,220 --> 03:33:43,620
Now let's go east.

3627
03:33:43,940 --> 03:33:44,700
I mean west.

3628
03:33:44,940 --> 03:33:45,160
Shoot.

3629
03:33:45,400 --> 03:33:46,460
I can't remember.

3630
03:33:47,500 --> 03:33:49,720
East, west, west...

3631
03:33:53,290 --> 03:33:53,790
Okay.

3632
03:33:56,030 --> 03:33:56,530
West.

3633
03:33:58,490 --> 03:34:00,010
Just keep heading west.

3634
03:34:00,770 --> 03:34:01,270
Probably.

3635
03:34:02,110 --> 03:34:03,470
Probably is correct.

3636
03:34:05,030 --> 03:34:07,770
I don't know how we found her on accident, but we did.

3637
03:34:09,550 --> 03:34:10,090
Oh shoot.

3638
03:34:10,770 --> 03:34:12,030
Oh, that's a girl I killed.

3639
03:34:12,130 --> 03:34:13,210
Wait, where the hell am I?

3640
03:34:16,410 --> 03:34:18,330
Guys, I'm really lost.

3641
03:34:22,690 --> 03:34:24,570
I wanna go back north a bit.

3642
03:34:27,510 --> 03:34:28,750
Follow the symbols?

3643
03:34:30,550 --> 03:34:32,050
Will they lead me home?

3644
03:34:33,250 --> 03:34:36,090
Take me home...

3645
03:34:36,090 --> 03:34:37,650
Demon symbol...

3646
03:34:39,250 --> 03:34:41,650
To the place...

3647
03:34:43,670 --> 03:34:44,950
I will...

3648
03:34:49,060 --> 03:34:49,380
Purify...

3649
03:34:49,840 --> 03:34:51,320
Oh my gosh, we found it!

3650
03:34:51,320 --> 03:34:55,140
What does a ghost owl say at the theater?

3651
03:34:57,340 --> 03:34:59,800
Do you really want to open this door?

3652
03:35:00,320 --> 03:35:00,680
Yes.

3653
03:35:01,680 --> 03:35:02,920
Oh, maybe not.

3654
03:35:05,240 --> 03:35:06,580
Maybe a bad idea.

3655
03:35:06,880 --> 03:35:08,600
I feel a little out of my element here.

3656
03:35:08,600 --> 03:35:10,760
A little priest.

3657
03:35:11,680 --> 03:35:13,980
How do you make a portal?

3658
03:35:23,300 --> 03:35:29,240
Is that like, how many monkeys does it take to change a lightbulb?

3659
03:35:30,160 --> 03:35:35,980
Sometimes it waits for someone who has already walked through it.

3660
03:35:36,720 --> 03:35:37,260
Oh no.

3661
03:35:37,880 --> 03:35:40,680
I'm the one who created the portal.

3662
03:35:40,680 --> 03:35:43,820
Oh no, you used me!

3663
03:35:53,380 --> 03:35:57,320
Woo, hell party!

3664
03:35:57,720 --> 03:36:01,040
Ah, you silly kids.

3665
03:36:02,400 --> 03:36:03,920
Alright, I'll leave you alone.

3666
03:36:06,100 --> 03:36:07,340
Sometimes...

3667
03:36:09,740 --> 03:36:10,980
Oh!

3668
03:36:16,560 --> 03:36:18,100
The kids!

3669
03:36:19,540 --> 03:36:21,200
Twins that we were looking for!

3670
03:36:22,740 --> 03:36:24,240
Are they the portal to hell?

3671
03:36:29,920 --> 03:36:31,020
Hi Gary!

3672
03:36:34,540 --> 03:36:36,400
Oh gosh...

3673
03:36:39,500 --> 03:36:40,020
Competent.

3674
03:36:40,660 --> 03:36:41,940
Yeah for real.

3675
03:36:43,220 --> 03:36:44,780
Help me!

3676
03:36:48,580 --> 03:36:50,660
A mummy, I hear thee.

3677
03:36:52,580 --> 03:36:55,480
John, son of man, what dost thou wish?

3678
03:36:57,660 --> 03:36:58,660
Kill Gary.

3679
03:36:59,160 --> 03:37:00,740
This is too much for me.

3680
03:37:01,520 --> 03:37:03,160
I'm so afraid.

3681
03:37:03,620 --> 03:37:06,020
Please let me escape this place.

3682
03:37:06,760 --> 03:37:09,240
And the girl?

3683
03:37:10,260 --> 03:37:11,980
I've done a lot, haven't I?

3684
03:37:12,220 --> 03:37:12,800
Come on!

3685
03:37:13,180 --> 03:37:15,260
I just want to go home.

3686
03:37:17,180 --> 03:37:20,980
If I leadest thou to safety...

3687
03:37:22,200 --> 03:37:25,280
Her fate shall be sealed upon thine head.

3688
03:37:25,420 --> 03:37:26,940
You're putting this on me!

3689
03:37:27,680 --> 03:37:28,740
Come on!

3690
03:37:29,360 --> 03:37:30,440
I'm just a guy!

3691
03:37:30,460 --> 03:37:31,660
I'll do whatever you want.

3692
03:37:32,020 --> 03:37:34,060
Just take me away from here.

3693
03:37:35,220 --> 03:37:36,820
He's done enough.

3694
03:37:37,040 --> 03:37:38,300
Swear it.

3695
03:37:39,380 --> 03:37:40,900
Why is this his fault?

3696
03:37:41,960 --> 03:37:43,160
Why is this his fault?

3697
03:37:54,200 --> 03:37:55,500
Time to go to jail.

3698
03:38:04,170 --> 03:38:06,570
October 31st, 1987.

3699
03:38:07,570 --> 03:38:08,850
The profane Sabbath.

3700
03:38:11,270 --> 03:38:11,610
Gary!

3701
03:38:12,370 --> 03:38:14,670
My name is Gary Miller.

3702
03:38:14,910 --> 03:38:15,770
Oh wait, no.

3703
03:38:16,290 --> 03:38:18,690
So you're the one behind all this.

3704
03:38:18,690 --> 03:38:24,210
In the name of the Lord, I demand to know what the hell is going on here.

3705
03:38:24,510 --> 03:38:26,190
Yeah, what the hell is going on here?

3706
03:38:28,630 --> 03:38:30,090
Yo, break it bad!

3707
03:38:31,070 --> 03:38:33,890
Well, you have come this far.

3708
03:38:34,050 --> 03:38:35,090
Yeah, I'm kind of crazy.

3709
03:38:35,230 --> 03:38:37,630
I suppose you deserve some answers.

3710
03:38:39,150 --> 03:38:41,630
Fine, you get three questions.

3711
03:38:42,070 --> 03:38:42,470
Questions.

3712
03:38:44,690 --> 03:38:45,130
Oh!

3713
03:38:48,250 --> 03:38:48,690
Injection?

3714
03:38:50,030 --> 03:38:51,430
I didn't see...

3715
03:38:53,490 --> 03:38:54,930
We never saw the needles.

3716
03:38:59,940 --> 03:39:02,320
We never saw the needles, so...

3717
03:39:02,320 --> 03:39:03,120
Let's ask about Gary.

3718
03:39:08,380 --> 03:39:11,460
Yeah, because I turned it off, but I thought it would censor it or something.

3719
03:39:19,820 --> 03:39:21,680
I thought it would...

3720
03:39:23,060 --> 03:39:24,880
I thought it would censor it, that's all.

3721
03:39:25,220 --> 03:39:25,620
That's why.

3722
03:39:27,220 --> 03:39:28,100
It did get censored.

3723
03:39:28,240 --> 03:39:29,340
Oh, I just didn't notice it.

3724
03:39:32,640 --> 03:39:33,520
The boys.

3725
03:39:41,310 --> 03:39:41,750
Huh?

3726
03:39:49,610 --> 03:39:50,090
What?

3727
03:39:52,190 --> 03:39:53,170
Wait, what do you mean by that?

3728
03:40:01,370 --> 03:40:05,130
So we were truly like going crazy in the midst of all this.

3729
03:40:13,250 --> 03:40:14,750
I'm curious about this one.

3730
03:40:17,750 --> 03:40:19,750
Oh it says victim I think.

3731
03:40:29,750 --> 03:40:30,910
A response?

3732
03:40:36,550 --> 03:40:40,350
Oh, he's fine though.

3733
03:40:41,750 --> 03:40:42,250
Huh?

3734
03:40:45,510 --> 03:40:46,030
Oh.

3735
03:40:49,010 --> 03:40:51,290
Oh no, is this the final battle?

3736
03:40:53,530 --> 03:40:54,050
Kneel.

3737
03:40:54,610 --> 03:40:55,390
Say decay.

3738
03:40:59,470 --> 03:41:01,210
Wait, how do I get the good ending though?

3739
03:41:01,290 --> 03:41:02,190
Unlock the thing.

3740
03:41:02,310 --> 03:41:02,830
Unlock.

3741
03:41:07,710 --> 03:41:08,870
Oh my gosh.

3742
03:41:09,510 --> 03:41:11,170
My cross, I forgot about it.

3743
03:41:21,980 --> 03:41:23,740
He's like...

3744
03:41:29,060 --> 03:41:33,210
Oh gosh, creature.

3745
03:41:44,870 --> 03:41:46,190
Oh gosh.

3746
03:41:47,030 --> 03:41:48,450
I'm so slow when this happens.

3747
03:41:53,150 --> 03:41:53,730
Da -da-da-da.

3748
03:41:59,450 --> 03:41:59,930
No!

3749
03:42:00,670 --> 03:42:02,150
No, Rain of Spiders!

3750
03:42:06,150 --> 03:42:07,410
I can't do this.

3751
03:42:08,570 --> 03:42:10,370
Oh shit, I'm gonna lose my cross.

3752
03:42:10,430 --> 03:42:11,110
Oh, I didn't lose it.

3753
03:42:11,550 --> 03:42:11,970
Amazing.

3754
03:42:14,250 --> 03:42:15,210
I can't.

3755
03:42:15,430 --> 03:42:16,310
Don't do it again.

3756
03:42:16,590 --> 03:42:17,410
Don't do it again.

3757
03:42:17,870 --> 03:42:18,350
Oh gosh.

3758
03:42:21,090 --> 03:42:22,670
That was close.

3759
03:42:26,670 --> 03:42:28,110
Don't do Rain of Spiders.

3760
03:42:28,630 --> 03:42:29,530
What the hell is that?

3761
03:42:30,590 --> 03:42:31,050
Oh shoot.

3762
03:42:31,890 --> 03:42:33,090
I avoided it somehow.

3763
03:42:34,670 --> 03:42:35,970
Rain of Spiders!

3764
03:42:40,630 --> 03:42:41,610
Don't do it.

3765
03:42:49,440 --> 03:42:50,480
Can you...

3766
03:42:50,480 --> 03:42:50,800
Okay.

3767
03:42:52,260 --> 03:42:53,060
Oh my god.

3768
03:42:54,460 --> 03:42:54,740
Okay.

3769
03:42:55,040 --> 03:42:57,480
He's just gonna keep throwing his little trident.

3770
03:42:59,700 --> 03:43:00,640
Oh shoot.

3771
03:43:02,020 --> 03:43:02,700
Okay.

3772
03:43:05,660 --> 03:43:06,980
Oh, big skelly.

3773
03:43:09,180 --> 03:43:11,060
Somehow he always runs into me.

3774
03:43:12,600 --> 03:43:13,880
Rain of Spiders.

3775
03:43:21,420 --> 03:43:22,420
Oh shoot.

3776
03:43:23,680 --> 03:43:24,880
Little baby!

3777
03:43:33,530 --> 03:43:34,490
Oh god!

3778
03:43:34,570 --> 03:43:35,870
There are so many spiders!

3779
03:43:42,690 --> 03:43:45,630
There are so many spiders, you guys.

3780
03:43:45,930 --> 03:43:47,190
I couldn't avoid them.

3781
03:43:47,870 --> 03:43:49,530
There are so many spiders.

3782
03:43:51,270 --> 03:43:52,130
Oh no, no.

3783
03:43:53,230 --> 03:43:54,290
He's gonna run into me.

3784
03:43:55,050 --> 03:43:55,690
Oh gosh.

3785
03:43:55,810 --> 03:43:57,030
Get my thing, get my thing, get my thing!

3786
03:43:59,210 --> 03:44:01,310
There are so many...

3787
03:44:13,140 --> 03:44:13,940
Father Garcia!

3788
03:44:25,540 --> 03:44:26,380
Yeah!

3789
03:44:28,540 --> 03:44:31,060
This is what we should've brought.

3790
03:44:31,180 --> 03:44:32,500
A fucking shotgun.

3791
03:44:32,840 --> 03:44:37,340
Oh my gosh.

3792
03:44:51,860 --> 03:44:52,260
Ah!

3793
03:44:56,980 --> 03:44:58,160
Wait, maybe me alone?

3794
03:45:01,460 --> 03:45:03,000
Wait, I have to go in by...

3795
03:45:07,580 --> 03:45:09,060
Wait, I go in by myself?

3796
03:45:13,060 --> 03:45:13,800
Oh my god.

3797
03:45:18,650 --> 03:45:19,270
Oh god.

3798
03:45:19,390 --> 03:45:20,350
I go in by myself?

3799
03:45:20,470 --> 03:45:20,730
OK!

3800
03:45:23,890 --> 03:45:25,310
Rain of Spiders.

3801
03:45:25,390 --> 03:45:26,210
The Crucible.

3802
03:45:26,590 --> 03:45:28,410
Wait, I'm scared of this.

3803
03:45:28,830 --> 03:45:30,530
Oh my gosh, I've never seen this before.

3804
03:45:31,530 --> 03:45:33,210
Oh god, is this really hard?

3805
03:45:34,650 --> 03:45:36,490
March 18th, 1934.

3806
03:45:36,910 --> 03:45:37,730
Mariam is ready.

3807
03:45:40,370 --> 03:45:44,230
We will perform the ritual according to her instructions tonight.

3808
03:45:45,470 --> 03:45:47,410
It's really hard, yeah?

3809
03:45:49,270 --> 03:45:50,630
Oh gosh.

3810
03:45:52,790 --> 03:45:54,130
It's pretty hard.

3811
03:45:54,250 --> 03:45:55,090
It may take a while.

3812
03:45:55,290 --> 03:45:58,650
Oh no, I should've just gotten some padding.

3813
03:46:01,110 --> 03:46:03,590
It used to be even harder before it was nerfed.

3814
03:46:03,690 --> 03:46:04,490
No way!

3815
03:46:05,570 --> 03:46:05,870
OK.

3816
03:46:07,330 --> 03:46:08,950
March 19th, 1934.

3817
03:46:10,990 --> 03:46:13,310
I've already been playing for almost 4 hours.

3818
03:46:14,230 --> 03:46:15,650
It's late and I'm tired.

3819
03:46:15,830 --> 03:46:18,390
I hope I can do it.

3820
03:46:18,390 --> 03:46:21,430
We successfully gave the second death to Mariam.

3821
03:46:22,170 --> 03:46:29,610
We have been passing living newborns through the newly made portal as quickly as we can get them.

3822
03:46:31,610 --> 03:46:33,150
Another baby!

3823
03:46:33,650 --> 03:46:34,730
Another baby!

3824
03:46:36,670 --> 03:46:40,350
So far there has been no response from the other side.

3825
03:46:41,830 --> 03:46:44,310
March 23rd, 1934.

3826
03:46:44,310 --> 03:46:48,850
After several days of sacrifices, we finally got a response.

3827
03:46:48,930 --> 03:46:50,930
A tiny hand reached out from the portal.

3828
03:46:51,330 --> 03:46:53,270
We took the hand and pulled out a baby boy.

3829
03:46:53,590 --> 03:46:56,650
It appears to be a normal human baby, just like you and me.

3830
03:46:57,030 --> 03:46:57,910
We named it Gary!

3831
03:46:58,030 --> 03:46:59,130
Oh my gosh, I was about to say!

3832
03:46:59,370 --> 03:47:00,590
Is this Gary?

3833
03:47:01,130 --> 03:47:02,710
Gary came from the portal!

3834
03:47:07,140 --> 03:47:08,620
Where the hell are we?

3835
03:47:14,430 --> 03:47:15,470
Gary loves you.

3836
03:47:15,570 --> 03:47:17,870
Gary is a normal human being, just like you and me.

3837
03:47:19,350 --> 03:47:21,570
Oh my gosh, I just realized we're in the house.

3838
03:47:25,870 --> 03:47:27,230
That was so loud.

3839
03:47:27,750 --> 03:47:28,110
I think?

3840
03:47:29,210 --> 03:47:29,650
Or...

3841
03:47:29,650 --> 03:47:30,890
Yeah, right?

3842
03:47:30,990 --> 03:47:31,930
This is the house, I think.

3843
03:47:33,050 --> 03:47:34,410
And this would be the bathroom.

3844
03:47:35,630 --> 03:47:36,070
Nevermind.

3845
03:47:36,730 --> 03:47:37,090
Wait.

3846
03:47:37,790 --> 03:47:38,170
No.

3847
03:47:38,430 --> 03:47:38,650
Wait.

3848
03:47:38,830 --> 03:47:38,990
No.

3849
03:47:39,110 --> 03:47:40,230
It's a different house, I think.

3850
03:47:41,150 --> 03:47:42,290
A ruined version.

3851
03:47:42,290 --> 03:47:42,890
No.

3852
03:47:46,810 --> 03:47:47,650
Gary loves you.

3853
03:47:47,690 --> 03:47:49,490
Gary is a normal human being, just like you and me.

3854
03:47:53,530 --> 03:47:54,350
Gary loves you.

3855
03:47:54,410 --> 03:47:56,610
Gary is a normal human being, just like you and me.

3856
03:48:00,200 --> 03:48:01,440
Oh, we're downstairs.

3857
03:48:02,280 --> 03:48:03,060
This is the kitchen.

3858
03:48:05,240 --> 03:48:05,920
Oh no!

3859
03:48:06,080 --> 03:48:07,220
Our coconut's gone!

3860
03:48:13,060 --> 03:48:14,820
So the family portrait would be there.

3861
03:48:16,380 --> 03:48:18,520
And I guess I got the note in this room.

3862
03:48:18,660 --> 03:48:19,820
Okay, let's go upstairs.

3863
03:48:33,360 --> 03:48:33,720
Okay.

3864
03:48:34,080 --> 03:48:35,460
Well, we can go to the attic.

3865
03:48:36,320 --> 03:48:37,120
Gary loves you.

3866
03:48:37,180 --> 03:48:39,100
Gary is a normal human being, just like you and me.

3867
03:48:40,680 --> 03:48:43,040
Why do I feel like I'm...

3868
03:48:43,040 --> 03:48:49,100
I feel like I got the notes in wrong order or something.

3869
03:48:49,100 --> 03:48:52,960
Because the first one had a bunch of lore and these are all just the same.

3870
03:48:53,640 --> 03:48:54,560
Gary loves you.

3871
03:48:54,620 --> 03:48:57,560
Gary is a normal human being, just like you and me.

3872
03:48:59,820 --> 03:49:01,380
Gary loves you.

3873
03:49:02,260 --> 03:49:03,940
Gary loves you.

3874
03:49:04,500 --> 03:49:08,160
Is a normal human being, just like you and me.

3875
03:49:08,360 --> 03:49:09,760
Gary loves you.

3876
03:49:10,240 --> 03:49:11,700
Gary loves you.

3877
03:49:12,280 --> 03:49:15,500
Is a normal human being, just like you and me.

3878
03:49:15,500 --> 03:49:22,260
In the day and in the night, Gary would never give you a fright.

3879
03:49:22,660 --> 03:49:28,380
It's just Gary, they all say, and then they all go about their day.

3880
03:49:28,460 --> 03:49:30,080
It's Gary... Wait.

3881
03:49:33,500 --> 03:49:36,060
This is a puzzle, isn't it?

3882
03:49:36,160 --> 03:49:37,020
Dang it!

3883
03:49:39,380 --> 03:49:41,840
Okay, so we start...

3884
03:49:42,500 --> 03:49:44,000
We start here.

3885
03:49:47,440 --> 03:49:49,260
I'm really worried if Gary loves me.

3886
03:49:49,360 --> 03:49:50,240
How would I know?

3887
03:49:56,100 --> 03:49:56,880
It's not?

3888
03:49:57,040 --> 03:49:57,260
Really?

3889
03:49:57,640 --> 03:49:59,200
Wait, did I not get the other one?

3890
03:50:05,360 --> 03:50:06,940
Am I just silly?

3891
03:50:08,780 --> 03:50:10,680
The mannequins toppled over.

3892
03:50:12,700 --> 03:50:13,860
Gary loves you.

3893
03:50:14,120 --> 03:50:16,520
Gary is a normal human being just like you and me.

3894
03:50:16,520 --> 03:50:19,260
Come on Gary!

3895
03:50:21,250 --> 03:50:22,240
Oh my gosh.

3896
03:50:22,700 --> 03:50:23,580
It's Gary-chan.

3897
03:50:25,060 --> 03:50:28,180
We got a real water problem here.

3898
03:50:30,160 --> 03:50:33,080
What about all the mannequins over here?

3899
03:50:36,480 --> 03:50:37,440
Gary loves you.

3900
03:50:40,880 --> 03:50:42,160
All the mannequins.

3901
03:50:52,760 --> 03:50:54,760
Gary loves you.

3902
03:50:57,740 --> 03:50:59,260
Gary loves you.

3903
03:51:00,140 --> 03:51:03,620
Oh god, it sounds so close.

3904
03:51:03,620 --> 03:51:04,160
What?

3905
03:51:10,650 --> 03:51:11,370
Okay.

3906
03:51:17,900 --> 03:51:19,840
Go to the basement, they said.

3907
03:51:29,880 --> 03:51:33,960
If it's not a puzzle, why do they respawn?

3908
03:51:38,840 --> 03:51:39,640
Oh wait.

3909
03:51:40,500 --> 03:51:41,360
Yeah, they are here.

3910
03:51:48,200 --> 03:51:50,080
I'm gonna try the attic instead.

3911
03:51:54,750 --> 03:51:56,090
Just to be obnoxious?

3912
03:51:56,210 --> 03:51:56,550
Okay.

3913
03:52:01,910 --> 03:52:02,950
Let's go to the attic.

3914
03:52:03,150 --> 03:52:03,790
The twins room?

3915
03:52:03,830 --> 03:52:04,830
It wouldn't let me in.

3916
03:52:05,170 --> 03:52:09,550
Well actually, it wouldn't let me in through one door.

3917
03:52:09,710 --> 03:52:10,710
So let's try another one.

3918
03:52:11,610 --> 03:52:13,770
Like, one of the ways it wouldn't let me in.

3919
03:52:16,290 --> 03:52:16,950
See?

3920
03:52:17,570 --> 03:52:18,730
It won't let me in.

3921
03:52:23,250 --> 03:52:24,670
Let's try the attic instead.

3922
03:52:27,770 --> 03:52:29,110
Gary loves you!

3923
03:52:31,430 --> 03:52:32,590
Oh, it saved.

3924
03:52:32,730 --> 03:52:33,370
Oh goodness.

3925
03:52:34,750 --> 03:52:35,350
Who the hell?

3926
03:52:39,810 --> 03:52:40,470
Tag.

3927
03:52:53,270 --> 03:52:54,110
Who?

3928
03:52:57,190 --> 03:52:58,350
With Tiffany?

3929
03:53:05,930 --> 03:53:07,410
Oh god.

3930
03:53:11,910 --> 03:53:12,890
Oh god.

3931
03:53:12,990 --> 03:53:13,490
Oh, Amy.

3932
03:53:14,890 --> 03:53:17,010
But Amy wasn't by choice.

3933
03:53:20,750 --> 03:53:22,050
Oh my gosh.

3934
03:53:27,900 --> 03:53:30,020
You wouldn't say that!

3935
03:53:30,260 --> 03:53:34,160
Oh my gosh, Gary looks like the Sink Baby.

3936
03:53:37,120 --> 03:53:39,000
From... Oh my god.

3937
03:53:39,580 --> 03:53:40,640
Oh god!

3938
03:53:45,160 --> 03:53:46,300
From PT.

3939
03:53:47,200 --> 03:53:48,480
Sink Baby Gary.

3940
03:53:49,920 --> 03:53:50,660
Oh my god.

3941
03:53:51,860 --> 03:53:52,300
Shoot.

3942
03:53:54,400 --> 03:53:55,560
I thought he was gonna...

3943
03:53:58,920 --> 03:54:00,800
I thought he was gonna do that.

3944
03:54:00,940 --> 03:54:01,460
I didn't know.

3945
03:54:02,080 --> 03:54:04,340
Oh yeah, I guess Tiffany actually was rejected.

3946
03:54:05,240 --> 03:54:07,440
Uh oh, my YouTube froze.

3947
03:54:08,860 --> 03:54:09,800
My YouTube froze.

3948
03:54:09,860 --> 03:54:10,340
Guys, hold on.

3949
03:54:10,360 --> 03:54:12,740
Give me one second before I...

3950
03:54:12,740 --> 03:54:15,980
Continue this happens every stream now.

3951
03:54:16,760 --> 03:54:18,080
I love it.

3952
03:54:18,220 --> 03:54:18,760
Yeah baby.

3953
03:54:19,580 --> 03:54:22,080
We love when the stream freezes.

3954
03:54:25,620 --> 03:54:27,080
There we go.

3955
03:54:27,980 --> 03:54:28,520
Okey dokey.

3956
03:54:28,660 --> 03:54:28,800
Alright.

3957
03:54:29,720 --> 03:54:30,300
Mortis.

3958
03:54:31,080 --> 03:54:34,040
I love you.

3959
03:54:35,060 --> 03:54:38,100
Oh gosh, how many times am I gonna hear this over and over again?

3960
03:54:40,180 --> 03:54:42,300
How many times am I gonna hear this?

3961
03:54:45,120 --> 03:54:46,260
Can I get rid of these?

3962
03:54:46,420 --> 03:54:46,600
No.

3963
03:54:47,320 --> 03:54:48,120
What about the mom?

3964
03:54:48,260 --> 03:54:49,280
Oh, he's gonna charge?

3965
03:54:51,120 --> 03:54:51,920
Oh god!

3966
03:54:53,440 --> 03:54:55,680
Why does he charge sometimes more than once?

3967
03:54:55,820 --> 03:54:57,560
The first time it was only the one time.

3968
03:55:07,890 --> 03:55:09,130
He's laughing this time.

3969
03:55:09,230 --> 03:55:10,010
I didn't hear that before.

3970
03:55:11,210 --> 03:55:13,150
Gary hates us, you guys.

3971
03:55:13,270 --> 03:55:14,650
Gary hates us.

3972
03:55:16,470 --> 03:55:17,630
Oh, he's gonna charge.

3973
03:55:25,270 --> 03:55:27,990
Why is it a triple now?

3974
03:55:30,110 --> 03:55:30,730
What?

3975
03:55:30,730 --> 03:55:30,910
What?

3976
03:55:37,650 --> 03:55:39,810
Yeah, I literally walked right into it.

3977
03:55:39,870 --> 03:55:42,970
But I don't understand how the first time he only did it once.

3978
03:55:43,390 --> 03:55:47,630
He only dashed once the first time.

3979
03:55:50,290 --> 03:55:50,890
See?

3980
03:55:51,350 --> 03:55:51,710
See?

3981
03:55:52,470 --> 03:55:54,590
He only dashes once there.

3982
03:55:55,350 --> 03:55:56,510
I'm so confused.

3983
03:56:06,420 --> 03:56:07,340
Stop it, Gary.

3984
03:56:07,540 --> 03:56:08,500
Gary, stop it.

3985
03:56:08,500 --> 03:56:10,960
Gary, you're freaking me out.

3986
03:56:13,640 --> 03:56:17,500
Gary, you're making it really... This is too much pepperoni, Gary.

3987
03:56:18,020 --> 03:56:18,460
Gary.

3988
03:56:19,340 --> 03:56:20,740
Oh my god, he's gonna dash.

3989
03:56:26,720 --> 03:56:27,320
Gary!

3990
03:56:27,620 --> 03:56:29,120
Gary, got the zoomies.

3991
03:56:29,760 --> 03:56:30,680
Zoomies, Gary.

3992
03:56:32,060 --> 03:56:33,820
Too much of pepperoni!

3993
03:56:34,940 --> 03:56:36,620
Too much of pepperoni!

3994
03:56:37,440 --> 03:56:38,300
Oh shoot.

3995
03:56:38,900 --> 03:56:40,120
Oh my god, no way.

3996
03:56:40,880 --> 03:56:42,020
Oh no, no, no.

3997
03:56:42,120 --> 03:56:43,180
No, this is so rude.

3998
03:56:43,300 --> 03:56:45,540
This is the meanest thing I've actually ever seen, ever.

3999
03:56:45,880 --> 03:56:46,820
Oh my gosh.

4000
03:56:47,520 --> 03:56:49,020
Oh my god, how did I live?

4001
03:57:01,850 --> 03:57:03,110
Oh my god!

4002
03:57:03,470 --> 03:57:04,390
Oh my god!

4003
03:57:08,380 --> 03:57:09,360
Wait, what the hell is that?

4004
03:57:11,220 --> 03:57:12,780
There's a chicken on the screen.

4005
03:57:13,460 --> 03:57:14,880
Oh my god, what?

4006
03:57:16,760 --> 03:57:17,940
There's two of them!

4007
03:57:17,940 --> 03:57:20,480
Oh my god.

4008
03:57:20,840 --> 03:57:21,300
No.

4009
03:57:21,740 --> 03:57:22,920
No way.

4010
03:57:24,640 --> 03:57:25,360
Don't dash.

4011
03:57:33,290 --> 03:57:34,090
I

4012
03:57:39,680 --> 03:57:42,640
think this might be impossible.

4013
03:57:44,040 --> 03:57:45,060
Hold on.

4014
03:57:58,910 --> 03:58:01,590
I had something I needed to do tonight and...

4015
03:58:03,130 --> 03:58:06,410
I didn't expect the stream to go on for this long.

4016
03:58:06,510 --> 03:58:08,610
I thought I would be done around this time.

4017
03:58:20,400 --> 03:58:22,440
I told them...

4018
03:58:23,180 --> 03:58:28,800
I said I was on the final boss and it's more difficult than I expected.

4019
03:58:31,020 --> 03:58:33,140
Why can't I go back to Reign of Spiders?

4020
03:58:35,400 --> 03:58:37,300
Why can't I go back to Reign of Spiders?

4021
03:58:37,380 --> 03:58:39,660
So he stops when he nearly grabs me.

4022
03:58:39,760 --> 03:58:40,300
Oh my gosh.

4023
03:58:41,000 --> 03:58:41,820
Stay away from me, Gary.

4024
03:58:42,100 --> 03:58:43,660
You're stinking fork hands.

4025
03:58:45,060 --> 03:58:48,880
This is why your mom didn't love you, because you have little forks for hands.

4026
03:58:53,580 --> 03:58:55,320
Malthus and Gary share a health bar.

4027
03:58:55,440 --> 03:58:56,180
Oh, thank you.

4028
03:58:57,040 --> 03:58:58,100
Okay, that's good to know.

4029
03:58:58,100 --> 03:59:03,360
That makes things maybe feel a little bit more doable, I suppose.

4030
03:59:04,900 --> 03:59:06,060
Oh my god, he's gonna charge.

4031
03:59:15,610 --> 03:59:16,310
Oh my god.

4032
03:59:16,370 --> 03:59:16,950
Oh my god.

4033
03:59:16,990 --> 03:59:17,890
Oh my gosh.

4034
03:59:21,820 --> 03:59:22,220
Gary.

4035
03:59:24,000 --> 03:59:24,400
Gary.

4036
03:59:25,380 --> 03:59:27,180
No, no, I'm gonna die here for real.

4037
03:59:27,540 --> 03:59:27,900
Oh my god.

4038
03:59:30,260 --> 03:59:31,940
I knew when he dashed.

4039
03:59:31,960 --> 03:59:32,880
I knew when he dashed.

4040
03:59:32,940 --> 03:59:36,920
I thought he would come for me, but I didn't know he would go up instead.

4041
03:59:46,190 --> 03:59:48,950
Guys, why did you tell me to get this fucking ending?

4042
03:59:49,810 --> 03:59:51,090
This is your fault!

4043
03:59:51,610 --> 03:59:54,690
Oh my god, I want to go back to Reign of Spiders.

4044
03:59:56,010 --> 03:59:57,330
This fight sucks.

4045
04:00:05,940 --> 04:00:06,380
Malthus.

4046
04:00:16,180 --> 04:00:18,460
I don't love Gary either.

4047
04:00:21,580 --> 04:00:24,180
I feel like I'm gonna be here literally all night.

4048
04:00:24,400 --> 04:00:25,240
Oh my gosh.

4049
04:00:31,960 --> 04:00:35,380
Oh my gosh, I wish there was a way to predict which way he was gonna...

4050
04:00:35,380 --> 04:00:36,200
Malthus.

4051
04:00:36,640 --> 04:00:38,280
He doesn't give you any hint.

4052
04:00:39,160 --> 04:00:39,600
Gary.

4053
04:00:43,860 --> 04:00:47,980
I can't believe you guys suggested this when I literally was just like... Oh my gosh.

4054
04:00:48,060 --> 04:00:49,840
Guys, I'm not 100% still.

4055
04:00:50,380 --> 04:00:51,300
I'm still, you know.

4056
04:00:52,560 --> 04:00:54,760
I'm still, you know, in a little bit of pain.

4057
04:00:55,380 --> 04:00:57,360
You're just like, we can fix that.

4058
04:00:57,920 --> 04:00:58,740
Just play.

4059
04:00:59,740 --> 04:01:02,360
Let's just get the true ending of...

4060
04:01:02,360 --> 04:01:03,060
Oh my gosh.

4061
04:01:03,700 --> 04:01:10,040
The true ending of faith and then you'll forget all about your pain because you'll be in mental anguish.

4062
04:01:11,780 --> 04:01:13,800
It's literally what you guys were thinking.

4063
04:01:14,560 --> 04:01:17,480
Oh my gosh, he gives no hint where he's going.

4064
04:01:17,680 --> 04:01:18,260
Oh my gosh.

4065
04:01:18,680 --> 04:01:27,000
Oh my...

4066
04:01:35,470 --> 04:01:37,270
I hate Father Garcia.

4067
04:01:37,990 --> 04:01:39,590
I hate Father Garcia.

4068
04:01:40,110 --> 04:01:41,930
Why didn't you come in here with me?

4069
04:01:41,930 --> 04:01:43,330
Father Garcia.

4070
04:01:45,150 --> 04:01:47,470
Father Garcia, you have an actual shotgun.

4071
04:01:48,690 --> 04:01:50,810
Why didn't you come in here with me?

4072
04:01:52,650 --> 04:01:57,190
At least when the other guy, when Malthus shows... Why is it already dark?

4073
04:01:57,410 --> 04:01:58,390
Are you serious right now?

4074
04:01:59,490 --> 04:02:00,890
Are you serious right now?

4075
04:02:03,130 --> 04:02:04,010
Evil game.

4076
04:02:04,150 --> 04:02:04,670
Evil game.

4077
04:02:04,770 --> 04:02:05,190
Evil game.

4078
04:02:05,770 --> 04:02:10,050
When Malthus shows up, I feel like Father Garcia should also show up with a shotgun.

4079
04:02:10,050 --> 04:02:10,910
I'm just saying.

4080
04:02:14,490 --> 04:02:15,950
I think I'm gonna die here.

4081
04:02:16,810 --> 04:02:17,730
What if I stand by the mom?

4082
04:02:22,770 --> 04:02:25,110
Actually, what if I just hide behind her the whole time?

4083
04:02:26,770 --> 04:02:27,950
Maybe that's an idea.

4084
04:02:31,510 --> 04:02:32,130
Oh shoot.

4085
04:02:32,510 --> 04:02:33,050
Go to the mom.

4086
04:02:33,490 --> 04:02:34,030
Go to the mom.

4087
04:02:34,750 --> 04:02:35,210
Go to mom.

4088
04:02:35,210 --> 04:02:35,410
Mom.

4089
04:02:44,710 --> 04:02:47,150
At least for this part I can do that.

4090
04:02:47,390 --> 04:02:48,190
I think.

4091
04:02:51,830 --> 04:02:52,430
Oh my god.

4092
04:02:52,590 --> 04:02:53,090
Oh my god!

4093
04:02:54,790 --> 04:02:56,710
I got stuck.

4094
04:03:06,340 --> 04:03:07,440
Mom's stuck.

4095
04:03:08,320 --> 04:03:09,700
No way.

4096
04:03:10,740 --> 04:03:11,880
Oh my god.

4097
04:03:11,940 --> 04:03:13,320
The dang pepperoni.

4098
04:03:14,180 --> 04:03:15,420
I ate too much pepperoni.

4099
04:03:16,620 --> 04:03:17,580
Holy moly.

4100
04:03:18,560 --> 04:03:21,440
I wish I had any holy moly here.

4101
04:03:22,480 --> 04:03:23,700
Oy the pepperoni.

4102
04:03:24,940 --> 04:03:25,360
Oh my god.

4103
04:03:27,980 --> 04:03:30,300
Okay, so he can crawl up to mommy.

4104
04:03:31,640 --> 04:03:35,180
My plan is a little flawed.

4105
04:03:35,600 --> 04:03:37,460
But it's not terrible I think.

4106
04:03:37,540 --> 04:03:37,860
Oh my god.

4107
04:03:37,980 --> 04:03:38,160
Wait.

4108
04:03:38,160 --> 04:03:39,100
Oh my god.

4109
04:03:39,360 --> 04:03:44,000
Why are you doing this creepy run at me instead of doing your sprints?

4110
04:03:44,300 --> 04:03:45,640
What is happening, Gary?

4111
04:03:46,720 --> 04:03:49,100
You're going against the...

4112
04:03:50,560 --> 04:03:52,160
You're going against the pattern!

4113
04:03:52,460 --> 04:03:53,700
You're going against the pattern!

4114
04:03:54,600 --> 04:03:57,520
Gary, you're supposed to have a pattern, Gary.

4115
04:04:12,650 --> 04:04:14,030
It's when you're close to him?

4116
04:04:14,130 --> 04:04:14,370
Okay.

4117
04:04:15,450 --> 04:04:17,090
I don't want to be close to him.

4118
04:04:19,410 --> 04:04:21,370
In fact, I want to be quite far away.

4119
04:04:23,710 --> 04:04:24,130
Oh my gosh.

4120
04:04:25,370 --> 04:04:25,750
Gary!

4121
04:04:26,190 --> 04:04:26,970
Oh Gary!

4122
04:04:27,730 --> 04:04:28,090
No!

4123
04:04:35,830 --> 04:04:38,290
Okay, if they share a health bar though...

4124
04:04:38,290 --> 04:04:41,650
All I have to do is avoid one of them, I guess.

4125
04:04:42,030 --> 04:04:42,590
Oh my gosh.

4126
04:04:42,650 --> 04:04:43,010
Oh my gosh.

4127
04:04:43,050 --> 04:04:43,470
Oh my gosh.

4128
04:04:43,510 --> 04:04:43,950
Oh my gosh.

4129
04:05:19,180 --> 04:05:20,060
I'm telling...

4130
04:05:28,720 --> 04:05:31,200
Is there like a way to cheese this, you guys?

4131
04:05:32,740 --> 04:05:33,620
Real question.

4132
04:05:34,140 --> 04:05:37,220
And if you don't tell me, I will go to YouTube.

4133
04:05:37,820 --> 04:05:38,400
Oh my god.

4134
04:05:38,580 --> 04:05:38,940
Oh my god.

4135
04:05:55,280 --> 04:05:57,540
If you don't tell me, YouTube couldn't well...

4136
04:06:01,020 --> 04:06:02,000
Faith?

4137
04:06:02,060 --> 04:06:03,400
I have no faith!

4138
04:06:04,000 --> 04:06:06,100
Oh my god.

4139
04:06:12,940 --> 04:06:14,030
No cheese?

4140
04:06:14,090 --> 04:06:14,430
Really?

4141
04:06:15,650 --> 04:06:17,490
I just have to...

4142
04:06:17,490 --> 04:06:18,250
do it?

4143
04:06:19,650 --> 04:06:20,550
Oh gosh.

4144
04:06:24,850 --> 04:06:25,830
Fine.

4145
04:06:40,900 --> 04:06:43,920
Why are you on this side now?

4146
04:06:44,660 --> 04:06:45,420
What do you mean?

4147
04:06:45,840 --> 04:06:47,180
Why are you on this side?

4148
04:06:48,240 --> 04:06:48,720
Malfus.

4149
04:06:49,060 --> 04:06:49,700
Oh my gosh.

4150
04:06:50,100 --> 04:06:50,700
Oh my gosh.

4151
04:06:51,200 --> 04:06:51,880
Malfus, no!

4152
04:06:53,080 --> 04:06:54,560
Oh my god, he's about to chase me!

4153
04:07:06,080 --> 04:07:09,300
I thought he did his little quick scuttle.

4154
04:07:09,460 --> 04:07:10,060
Not the...

4155
04:07:12,920 --> 04:07:13,880
Not the...

4156
04:07:13,880 --> 04:07:15,320
Oh my god, I'm on fire!

4157
04:07:15,920 --> 04:07:16,880
Oh my god!

4158
04:07:31,110 --> 04:07:32,930
You can even...

4159
04:07:32,930 --> 04:07:35,470
Wait, can I set him on fire?

4160
04:07:35,850 --> 04:07:36,830
Is this the cheese?

4161
04:07:40,250 --> 04:07:41,570
Is that a... Oh, no.

4162
04:07:47,810 --> 04:07:49,910
How many phases is this?

4163
04:07:49,930 --> 04:07:50,650
You guys know?

4164
04:07:52,670 --> 04:07:53,890
After...

4165
04:07:53,890 --> 04:07:54,650
After...

4166
04:07:55,390 --> 04:07:58,890
When Morpheus shows up, how much more?

4167
04:07:59,090 --> 04:08:00,090
Three phases!

4168
04:08:00,570 --> 04:08:01,610
Oh my god!

4169
04:08:08,630 --> 04:08:11,070
Three phases!

4170
04:08:13,630 --> 04:08:15,160
No way!

4171
04:08:19,560 --> 04:08:21,390
No way!

4172
04:08:22,150 --> 04:08:22,870
Three...

4173
04:08:24,030 --> 04:08:29,250
See, that's what I thought he was doing in the previous run...

4174
04:08:29,250 --> 04:08:31,390
When I got caught during...

4175
04:08:32,270 --> 04:08:33,770
The Morpheus...

4176
04:08:33,770 --> 04:08:34,310
Oh my gosh.

4177
04:08:34,950 --> 04:08:35,930
Of the stream.

4178
04:08:36,090 --> 04:08:36,450
Really?

4179
04:08:41,470 --> 04:08:42,190
Really?

4180
04:08:43,370 --> 04:08:44,910
And this whole fight's RNG.

4181
04:08:46,610 --> 04:08:48,110
It's too cruel!

4182
04:08:49,170 --> 04:08:50,610
It's too cruel!

4183
04:08:50,610 --> 04:08:50,670
It's too cruel!

4184
04:08:52,750 --> 04:08:54,730
To get the true end for what?

4185
04:08:56,190 --> 04:08:57,270
I could just...

4186
04:08:57,270 --> 04:08:59,110
I could just YouTube the true end.

4187
04:08:59,930 --> 04:09:02,110
I could just...

4188
04:09:12,050 --> 04:09:13,250
Bragging rights?

4189
04:09:14,510 --> 04:09:15,650
Oh my gosh.

4190
04:09:20,270 --> 04:09:23,810
Oh my gosh.

4191
04:09:23,810 --> 04:09:26,490
Maybe I need to stick closer to him.

4192
04:09:27,290 --> 04:09:30,950
So he does just do his little tiny scuttle instead of the long charges.

4193
04:09:32,390 --> 04:09:33,370
Oh my god, I'm blocked.

4194
04:09:35,710 --> 04:09:37,450
It's a pepperoni!

4195
04:09:39,030 --> 04:09:41,090
It's a pepperoni!

4196
04:09:45,670 --> 04:09:46,070
Ah!

4197
04:09:55,780 --> 04:09:57,700
Sorry, super chat went too fast.

4198
04:09:57,760 --> 04:09:58,640
I couldn't read it.

4199
04:09:58,720 --> 04:10:00,020
We were trying to help me out.

4200
04:10:04,040 --> 04:10:05,040
Thank you for the...

4201
04:10:05,040 --> 04:10:06,880
No, no, thanks for the super chat.

4202
04:10:08,940 --> 04:10:10,440
Oh, it's a pepperoni.

4203
04:10:15,300 --> 04:10:17,100
Is this a charge or is this a scuttle?

4204
04:10:17,180 --> 04:10:17,840
It's a charge!

4205
04:10:20,460 --> 04:10:20,860
No.

4206
04:10:34,870 --> 04:10:35,430
No.

4207
04:10:35,850 --> 04:10:36,270
Oh god.

4208
04:10:38,970 --> 04:10:40,410
Oh my god.

4209
04:10:43,090 --> 04:10:43,650
What

4210
04:10:50,690 --> 04:10:53,130
do you mean useful cheese and she misses it?

4211
04:10:53,190 --> 04:10:57,470
Well if you guys stopped chatting for so much, you pushed it away!

4212
04:10:57,590 --> 04:10:58,750
You pushed it off the screen!

4213
04:10:59,290 --> 04:11:00,110
How can I...

4214
04:11:00,110 --> 04:11:02,050
It's not my fault, I missed it!

4215
04:11:03,170 --> 04:11:05,230
Because you pushed it off the screen!

4216
04:11:07,430 --> 04:11:08,750
Because of the chat!

4217
04:11:11,970 --> 04:11:13,150
It's not me!

4218
04:11:14,270 --> 04:11:15,590
See you guys, what are you doing?

4219
04:11:15,830 --> 04:11:17,070
Oh my gosh, oh my god.

4220
04:11:17,670 --> 04:11:18,310
What the hell?

4221
04:11:20,470 --> 04:11:22,010
What the hell is this?

4222
04:11:24,230 --> 04:11:27,650
Oh my god, he's dancing on the playing field now.

4223
04:11:28,130 --> 04:11:30,290
Now you wanna join us, Morbius?

4224
04:11:30,630 --> 04:11:31,910
Oh my god, he's gonna charge.

4225
04:11:32,950 --> 04:11:34,110
It's charging time.

4226
04:11:34,690 --> 04:11:36,030
Oh my god, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4227
04:11:36,590 --> 04:11:37,070
No!

4228
04:11:37,190 --> 04:11:37,830
Oh my god.

4229
04:11:37,830 --> 04:11:39,990
Oh my god, I lived.

4230
04:11:44,210 --> 04:11:46,150
Oh my god.

4231
04:11:49,770 --> 04:11:51,310
A little scuttle.

4232
04:11:51,890 --> 04:11:53,210
A little scuttle time.

4233
04:11:53,330 --> 04:11:54,750
Oh my gosh, please, please, please, please.

4234
04:11:54,830 --> 04:11:56,230
Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs.

4235
04:12:00,790 --> 04:12:04,050
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

4236
04:12:05,230 --> 04:12:05,770
Phase 3.

4237
04:12:06,850 --> 04:12:07,410
Mom?

4238
04:12:14,980 --> 04:12:15,880
Oh no.

4239
04:12:16,680 --> 04:12:17,880
What is this?

4240
04:12:18,840 --> 04:12:19,760
Touhou Reel.

4241
04:12:28,100 --> 04:12:29,580
What the hell is that?

4242
04:12:31,880 --> 04:12:32,920
Oh my gosh.

4243
04:12:33,340 --> 04:12:35,440
No, please, don't come swooping down.

4244
04:12:37,380 --> 04:12:38,960
I don't wanna do this again.

4245
04:12:39,840 --> 04:12:41,820
I don't wanna go through it again, please.

4246
04:12:42,260 --> 04:12:43,680
Oh my god, poison apple.

4247
04:12:46,140 --> 04:12:48,020
My god, take this cup from me.

4248
04:12:48,020 --> 04:12:49,140
What the hell does that mean?

4249
04:12:50,000 --> 04:12:52,300
Oh my god, do I have lives now?

4250
04:12:52,820 --> 04:12:53,740
What is happening?

4251
04:12:54,160 --> 04:12:55,940
My god, please, god, please.

4252
04:12:56,200 --> 04:12:57,980
This abomination's power is too great.

4253
04:13:00,380 --> 04:13:02,620
No, and yet, it is not the end.

4254
04:13:04,340 --> 04:13:06,020
Oh my god, oh my god, I have...

4255
04:13:07,360 --> 04:13:08,800
How many lives do I have?

4256
04:13:08,980 --> 04:13:10,600
I don't even know, I'm scared.

4257
04:13:11,460 --> 04:13:13,020
Oh my god, the...

4258
04:13:13,940 --> 04:13:15,420
The music's kind of awesome though.

4259
04:13:18,020 --> 04:13:19,460
Uh oh, am I gonna die in here?

4260
04:13:23,070 --> 04:13:25,110
Oh no, poison apple, poison apple.

4261
04:13:25,570 --> 04:13:27,110
Poison apple, poison apple.

4262
04:13:27,270 --> 04:13:28,450
I can't, I can't bite you.

4263
04:13:28,830 --> 04:13:30,170
And poison apple at the same time.

4264
04:13:30,490 --> 04:13:31,630
Please, please.

4265
04:13:33,530 --> 04:13:34,310
Oh my god.

4266
04:13:38,990 --> 04:13:39,470
Touhou!

4267
04:13:45,110 --> 04:13:47,130
What the hell are these danmaku?

4268
04:13:47,810 --> 04:13:49,930
I can't attack you if you're doing this.

4269
04:13:49,930 --> 04:13:50,750
No!

4270
04:13:51,050 --> 04:13:52,970
Perhaps some divine intervention at last.

4271
04:13:55,450 --> 04:13:57,870
Perhaps some divine intervention at last!

4272
04:14:01,110 --> 04:14:02,270
Oh my god.

4273
04:14:03,050 --> 04:14:05,090
Yes lord, I feel thou art with me.

4274
04:14:05,650 --> 04:14:06,830
I think I'm gonna die, you guys.

4275
04:14:07,330 --> 04:14:08,210
I think I'm gonna die.

4276
04:14:08,610 --> 04:14:09,210
Oh no, no, no.

4277
04:14:09,450 --> 04:14:10,030
OK, we're out.

4278
04:14:12,630 --> 04:14:13,410
Let's get closer.

4279
04:14:13,690 --> 04:14:14,070
There we go.

4280
04:14:14,610 --> 04:14:14,970
Damn it.

4281
04:14:17,370 --> 04:14:17,890
Um...

4282
04:14:17,890 --> 04:14:18,890
Five hits left?

4283
04:14:18,990 --> 04:14:19,430
Oh god.

4284
04:14:29,520 --> 04:14:30,040
Please.

4285
04:14:31,260 --> 04:14:33,700
I don't know how much more I can do this though.

4286
04:14:43,410 --> 04:14:45,670
Thy saving grace transfigures me.

4287
04:14:46,510 --> 04:14:47,710
Oh no, no.

4288
04:14:48,410 --> 04:14:49,150
No, no, no, no.

4289
04:14:51,210 --> 04:14:52,890
No, please, please.

4290
04:14:54,310 --> 04:14:56,510
How much life do you have left, lady?

4291
04:14:57,290 --> 04:14:57,810
Please...

4292
04:14:59,890 --> 04:15:00,470
Oh my god.

4293
04:15:01,250 --> 04:15:04,370
Oh shit!

4294
04:15:04,730 --> 04:15:06,750
The power to save myself and those I love!

4295
04:15:09,190 --> 04:15:10,810
I'm not fast enough for these.

4296
04:15:10,890 --> 04:15:12,510
I'm not fast enough to avoid these.

4297
04:15:13,230 --> 04:15:14,770
That's how scared I am.

4298
04:15:18,570 --> 04:15:19,750
Please die!

4299
04:15:20,350 --> 04:15:21,370
Please die!

4300
04:15:22,090 --> 04:15:22,430
Die!

4301
04:15:24,190 --> 04:15:27,410
OK, this one I think is the maybe easiest quote-unquote.

4302
04:15:28,530 --> 04:15:31,830
I just have to dance around in it, inside it.

4303
04:15:31,890 --> 04:15:33,270
But then she throws the poison apples!

4304
04:15:39,330 --> 04:15:39,970
Oh my god.

4305
04:15:42,230 --> 04:15:43,890
Oh my god, I made it, I made it.

4306
04:15:44,130 --> 04:15:44,470
Somehow.

4307
04:15:44,750 --> 04:15:45,810
No, no more poison apples.

4308
04:15:45,910 --> 04:15:46,770
I hate this one, please.

4309
04:15:47,510 --> 04:15:48,170
Please, lady.

4310
04:15:48,670 --> 04:15:49,870
Please, lady, let me live.

4311
04:15:50,530 --> 04:15:51,750
Please, lady, let me live.

4312
04:15:52,270 --> 04:15:53,710
Please, lady, let me live.

4313
04:15:53,710 --> 04:15:56,990
I cannot go on like this forever.

4314
04:15:59,630 --> 04:16:00,750
Please, please!

4315
04:16:10,770 --> 04:16:12,550
No, no, no, no, no.

4316
04:16:12,750 --> 04:16:13,390
The cross...

4317
04:16:13,390 --> 04:16:15,830
The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

4318
04:16:16,470 --> 04:16:17,030
Please!

4319
04:16:18,210 --> 04:16:20,850
Guys, guys, I don't know about this, guys.

4320
04:16:23,210 --> 04:16:23,770
Please.

4321
04:16:37,150 --> 04:16:38,650
What do you mean go to the fire?

4322
04:16:45,300 --> 04:16:46,160
No, too late?

4323
04:16:46,300 --> 04:16:46,860
Oh, OK.

4324
04:16:48,580 --> 04:16:50,640
How often we forget faith with our words.

4325
04:16:51,160 --> 04:16:53,240
No, you guys...

4326
04:16:54,140 --> 04:16:55,720
What do you mean it was too late?

4327
04:16:56,040 --> 04:16:58,800
What the...what?

4328
04:16:59,180 --> 04:17:00,420
I'm so confused.

4329
04:17:01,240 --> 04:17:02,640
What do you mean wasting my chance?

4330
04:17:02,760 --> 04:17:04,600
I have no fucking idea what this is!

4331
04:17:05,320 --> 04:17:07,320
What do you mean wasting your chance?

4332
04:17:07,440 --> 04:17:09,380
As if I fucking know what I'm doing!

4333
04:17:09,680 --> 04:17:10,240
What do you mean?

4334
04:17:10,340 --> 04:17:11,960
This is the first fucking time I'm playing this!

4335
04:17:11,960 --> 04:17:12,740
You bitch!

4336
04:17:12,940 --> 04:17:14,320
What do you mean wasting my chance?

4337
04:17:14,520 --> 04:17:15,200
You motherfucker!

4338
04:17:15,940 --> 04:17:19,000
Like I'm supposed to know every fucking thing about this game!

4339
04:18:26,700 --> 04:18:30,380
OK, when he splits I'll run to the fire.

4340
04:18:30,940 --> 04:18:31,580
Thank you.

4341
04:18:58,270 --> 04:18:59,930
Oh gosh!

4342
04:19:00,450 --> 04:19:02,030
I was right there!

4343
04:19:42,350 --> 04:19:44,790
How are you supposed to know to even do that though?

4344
04:19:45,630 --> 04:19:47,950
How are you supposed to even know to do that part?

4345
04:19:54,380 --> 04:19:58,860
At least they give you multiple lives in that part.

4346
04:19:59,660 --> 04:20:00,700
They're not so cruel.

4347
04:20:01,560 --> 04:20:03,140
I just feel like I wasted them.

4348
04:20:03,260 --> 04:20:04,760
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

4349
04:20:08,260 --> 04:20:08,980
Holy shit!

4350
04:20:08,980 --> 04:20:09,240
No!

4351
04:20:13,200 --> 04:20:17,380
Get out of the way.

4352
04:20:22,390 --> 04:20:23,510
Oh shit!

4353
04:20:24,870 --> 04:20:26,090
I didn't notice.

4354
04:20:28,710 --> 04:20:29,330
Hold

4355
04:20:34,640 --> 04:20:36,540
on, my tears are going down my neck.

4356
04:20:36,560 --> 04:20:37,220
It's uncomfortable.

4357
04:20:39,180 --> 04:20:41,340
There was a note that told you?

4358
04:20:41,720 --> 04:20:43,920
They expect you to remember that?

4359
04:20:44,680 --> 04:20:45,960
What was the note?

4360
04:20:47,100 --> 04:20:48,400
What was the note?

4361
04:20:54,910 --> 04:20:55,470
What?

4362
04:21:01,380 --> 04:21:03,880
This is about the human baby.

4363
04:21:04,540 --> 04:21:05,820
The most recent note.

4364
04:21:07,440 --> 04:21:08,640
The last note.

4365
04:21:08,720 --> 04:21:09,980
This is the last one.

4366
04:21:11,560 --> 04:21:12,660
Back one more.

4367
04:21:13,360 --> 04:21:14,020
This one?

4368
04:21:18,080 --> 04:21:19,380
Thank you for my pet.

4369
04:21:19,480 --> 04:21:20,280
No, that's the pet.

4370
04:21:23,300 --> 04:21:23,940
What?

4371
04:21:25,340 --> 04:21:25,560
What?

4372
04:21:25,560 --> 04:21:26,660
When you descend the navel.

4373
04:21:29,140 --> 04:21:30,480
Oh, this one maybe?

4374
04:21:31,800 --> 04:21:39,460
The cross hath the power to weaken the mother, but only someone who is ablaze with purifying fire can truly destroy her.

4375
04:21:39,900 --> 04:21:41,340
Oh my god.

4376
04:21:43,880 --> 04:21:46,020
Ok, wow, ok.

4377
04:21:46,020 --> 04:21:46,180
Ok.

4378
04:21:48,560 --> 04:21:50,020
That is such...

4379
04:21:51,040 --> 04:21:52,360
Oh shit, he's right there.

4380
04:21:54,060 --> 04:21:55,820
That is actual such bullshit.

4381
04:21:59,360 --> 04:22:01,560
It's like, by the way, did you read my note?

4382
04:22:02,200 --> 04:22:04,100
Did you read my note, VTuber?

4383
04:22:04,580 --> 04:22:10,940
By the way, while you're in mid-battle after having gone through three phases, did you remember my note?

4384
04:22:12,320 --> 04:22:15,520
Did you remember what I said to you?

4385
04:22:17,120 --> 04:22:18,220
Oh my god.

4386
04:22:20,060 --> 04:22:30,700
By the way, when you were freaking out because of the little poison skulls that were flying around your face, did you remember to set yourself on fire because it said so in one teeny little sentence?

4387
04:22:31,380 --> 04:22:31,940
On a note?

4388
04:22:32,580 --> 04:22:33,480
Did you do that?

4389
04:22:33,720 --> 04:22:35,040
Did you do that, VTuber?

4390
04:22:35,040 --> 04:22:35,160
VTuber?

4391
04:22:35,640 --> 04:22:36,140
VTuber?

4392
04:22:37,460 --> 04:22:38,920
VTuber, I figured it out.

4393
04:22:39,020 --> 04:22:44,260
VTuber, why didn't you remember that singular sentence that you read like 50 minutes ago?

4394
04:22:44,420 --> 04:22:44,800
VTuber?

4395
04:22:45,280 --> 04:22:47,820
I think you need to pay better attention to the game, VTuber.

4396
04:22:48,120 --> 04:22:49,860
VTuber literally laid it out for you.

4397
04:23:02,560 --> 04:23:04,860
Is the VTuber even playing this game?

4398
04:23:05,780 --> 04:23:08,000
Are we playing the same game, VTuber?

4399
04:23:08,180 --> 04:23:15,160
Because you also ran into the fire earlier and it basically explained the whole thing to you.

4400
04:23:16,380 --> 04:23:17,180
Oh my god.

4401
04:23:23,640 --> 04:23:24,520
Are we safe?

4402
04:23:24,620 --> 04:23:24,800
Okay.

4403
04:23:26,100 --> 04:23:27,720
I say safe, but you know.

4404
04:23:29,660 --> 04:23:30,340
Oh god.

4405
04:23:34,000 --> 04:23:35,040
My little bullets.

4406
04:23:35,200 --> 04:23:35,660
Oh my gosh.

4407
04:23:36,680 --> 04:23:37,680
He's gonna charge!

4408
04:23:38,620 --> 04:23:39,040
No!

4409
04:23:39,220 --> 04:23:41,020
Please, I might be trapped.

4410
04:23:41,120 --> 04:23:43,700
Oh my god, I barely made that.

4411
04:23:48,480 --> 04:23:51,300
I don't know which one would be easier to get, to be honest.

4412
04:23:53,560 --> 04:23:54,020
Oh my god.

4413
04:23:55,420 --> 04:23:56,820
I don't

4414
04:24:00,400 --> 04:24:01,040
know exactly.

4415
04:24:01,280 --> 04:24:01,920
Oh, nice!

4416
04:24:03,060 --> 04:24:03,400
Okay.

4417
04:24:04,500 --> 04:24:04,940
Mommy?

4418
04:24:07,240 --> 04:24:08,420
There they go.

4419
04:24:09,240 --> 04:24:10,500
Okay, mommy time!

4420
04:24:11,800 --> 04:24:14,120
Phase 3, let's go!

4421
04:24:14,920 --> 04:24:16,280
Alright, how many lives?

4422
04:24:19,180 --> 04:24:21,000
This part is so cruel.

4423
04:24:21,460 --> 04:24:22,520
It's so cruel.

4424
04:24:23,800 --> 04:24:25,920
I love the final boss music though.

4425
04:24:25,920 --> 04:24:27,460
It's so awesome.

4426
04:24:29,300 --> 04:24:29,860
Oh

4427
04:24:36,220 --> 04:24:37,980
my god, I hate the skulls.

4428
04:24:39,100 --> 04:24:41,980
Oh gosh, the skulls.

4429
04:24:42,520 --> 04:24:43,440
Oh my god.

4430
04:24:46,860 --> 04:24:47,420
Lady?

4431
04:24:48,100 --> 04:24:48,500
Lady?

4432
04:24:48,720 --> 04:24:49,940
I just walked over there.

4433
04:24:50,200 --> 04:24:51,300
Please, I'm really slow.

4434
04:24:51,980 --> 04:24:54,700
You'd think he would, like, run, you know?

4435
04:24:55,020 --> 04:24:56,820
Have any sort of urgency.

4436
04:24:57,940 --> 04:24:59,100
Mr. Priest.

4437
04:24:59,620 --> 04:25:00,720
John Priest.

4438
04:25:01,480 --> 04:25:02,580
Any sort of urgency.

4439
04:25:13,430 --> 04:25:15,130
Yeah, yeah, I like this one.

4440
04:25:16,570 --> 04:25:17,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this one's not so bad.

4441
04:25:21,350 --> 04:25:23,750
Nice and cozy with mommy!

4442
04:25:24,910 --> 04:25:26,990
And some little poisoned apples.

4443
04:25:27,990 --> 04:25:28,890
Oh my gosh.

4444
04:25:29,130 --> 04:25:29,910
Oh no, no, no.

4445
04:25:35,590 --> 04:25:37,190
Oh god.

4446
04:25:38,410 --> 04:25:40,630
This part is actually cruel.

4447
04:25:41,130 --> 04:25:43,950
This part is so... What the hell is this?

4448
04:25:44,970 --> 04:25:46,410
What is this?

4449
04:25:47,210 --> 04:25:48,930
Little Don Muckle... No!

4450
04:25:49,530 --> 04:25:49,850
No!

4451
04:25:51,170 --> 04:25:51,810
No!

4452
04:25:56,990 --> 04:25:58,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4453
04:26:04,570 --> 04:26:06,010
Flames and...

4454
04:26:06,010 --> 04:26:10,690
Alright, I avoided.

4455
04:26:11,570 --> 04:26:12,290
Alright, lady.

4456
04:26:13,550 --> 04:26:14,790
I'm taking you down.

4457
04:26:15,370 --> 04:26:17,030
He's walking as fast as he can.

4458
04:26:18,390 --> 04:26:18,690
Hello?

4459
04:26:19,830 --> 04:26:22,270
Oh my god, I forgot about that part.

4460
04:26:23,990 --> 04:26:24,190
Hello?

4461
04:26:26,610 --> 04:26:27,330
Dodge!

4462
04:26:27,330 --> 04:26:29,370
Yeah, we did it!

4463
04:26:33,120 --> 04:26:35,520
The music is so awesome!

4464
04:26:40,310 --> 04:26:42,610
Oh gosh, the poisoned apples!

4465
04:26:45,290 --> 04:26:46,770
Oh gosh...

4466
04:26:46,770 --> 04:26:51,790
It scares me so much.

4467
04:26:58,630 --> 04:26:59,870
Oh, this part.

4468
04:27:15,240 --> 04:27:16,740
Don't come towards me.

4469
04:27:17,240 --> 04:27:18,240
What are you doing?

4470
04:27:18,960 --> 04:27:19,720
Fire!

4471
04:27:20,080 --> 04:27:20,080
Fire!

4472
04:27:20,220 --> 04:27:20,420
Fire!

4473
04:27:54,010 --> 04:27:55,910
That was so easy.

4474
04:28:01,810 --> 04:28:02,970
Don't skip it.

4475
04:28:12,720 --> 04:28:13,600
Oh yeah!

4476
04:28:13,840 --> 04:28:14,720
Get his ass!

4477
04:28:17,560 --> 04:28:18,600
Oh yeah!

4478
04:28:19,400 --> 04:28:20,280
Eat Gary!

4479
04:28:21,340 --> 04:28:22,180
Oh my god!

4480
04:28:22,260 --> 04:28:24,580
I didn't think she would actually do it.

4481
04:28:25,200 --> 04:28:26,860
Nano, thanks for the...

4482
04:28:26,860 --> 04:28:28,620
Oh my god, Murphy, thank you!

4483
04:28:28,760 --> 04:28:29,740
Nano, thanks for the tech gifted!

4484
04:28:43,660 --> 04:28:44,700
So nice.

4485
04:28:47,540 --> 04:28:50,180
At least Toho shows you where your hitbox is.

4486
04:28:51,080 --> 04:28:53,360
Thanks for the tech gifted!

4487
04:28:54,840 --> 04:28:56,540
Oh my gosh, we did it!

4488
04:28:57,020 --> 04:28:58,740
I've been so brave, yeah!

4489
04:28:59,240 --> 04:29:00,120
Can I rest?

4490
04:29:02,980 --> 04:29:05,100
It's time to finish what I started.

4491
04:29:06,000 --> 04:29:07,400
Hey Mac, thanks for the tech gifted!

4492
04:29:17,540 --> 04:29:18,880
Zile, thanks for the tech gifted!

4493
04:29:20,780 --> 04:29:21,980
Her balls!

4494
04:29:23,400 --> 04:29:24,520
Oh my god!

4495
04:29:25,440 --> 04:29:25,880
Amen!

4496
04:29:29,000 --> 04:29:32,740
Oh my god, it's like the ending of an action film.

4497
04:29:34,760 --> 04:29:35,840
Oh my god!

4498
04:29:36,360 --> 04:29:37,600
All the cops are dead.

4499
04:29:39,100 --> 04:29:41,440
I hope our fingerprints aren't at the scene.

4500
04:29:50,280 --> 04:29:51,560
Oh my god.

4501
04:29:57,160 --> 04:29:57,880
Yes.

4502
04:30:05,600 --> 04:30:06,320
Yes.

4503
04:30:07,220 --> 04:30:08,820
How long did that boss fight take me?

4504
04:30:12,060 --> 04:30:13,120
Half hour?

4505
04:30:17,440 --> 04:30:18,520
8 hours.

4506
04:30:18,520 --> 04:30:18,780
Nice.

4507
04:30:22,520 --> 04:30:24,640
Ah man, thanks for the locker so far.

4508
04:30:26,260 --> 04:30:26,920
Have crowns too.

4509
04:30:31,200 --> 04:30:31,780
John!

4510
04:30:39,810 --> 04:30:46,410
Oh my god, the Lisa Riz!

4511
04:30:51,030 --> 04:30:53,270
I'll never be able to rest.

4512
04:30:57,310 --> 04:31:00,850
Oh my gosh, why didn't you want to stay at my house Lisa?

4513
04:31:03,870 --> 04:31:06,110
Oh wait, I get to choose?

4514
04:31:09,590 --> 04:31:12,050
I think I kind of want to stay with Father Garcia.

4515
04:31:12,310 --> 04:31:14,530
I'm sorry Lisa, but he has a gun.

4516
04:31:17,350 --> 04:31:19,150
Bros before hoes.

4517
04:31:21,710 --> 04:31:24,010
Let's go fight some demons!

4518
04:31:34,910 --> 04:31:37,210
Amen to that brother!

4519
04:31:40,930 --> 04:31:43,110
Let's go fight some demons!

4520
04:31:44,010 --> 04:31:45,290
Oh my gosh, you know what?

4521
04:31:45,650 --> 04:31:46,990
That was so worth it.

4522
04:31:47,330 --> 04:31:49,730
That cleansed everything from me.

4523
04:31:52,310 --> 04:31:53,530
Oh my gosh!

4524
04:31:54,250 --> 04:31:55,410
Guys, am I a gamer?

4525
04:31:56,710 --> 04:32:01,910
Oh my gosh, I did like the hardest boss in the game.

4526
04:32:01,970 --> 04:32:02,670
That's kind of crazy.

4527
04:32:03,270 --> 04:32:04,250
Oh my god, I'm a gamer.

4528
04:32:06,270 --> 04:32:07,150
Winto Gaming.

4529
04:32:10,790 --> 04:32:11,230
Yippee!

4530
04:32:11,590 --> 04:32:12,790
Amen, brother.

4531
04:32:17,430 --> 04:32:21,810
Once I got a little bit more used to the mechanics, it was fine.

4532
04:32:24,150 --> 04:32:26,590
It was definitely tough at first.

4533
04:32:27,310 --> 04:32:29,110
But then it was like, not bad.

4534
04:32:29,770 --> 04:32:31,830
In the last run I was just like, oh okay.

4535
04:32:32,370 --> 04:32:34,330
This is pretty... not so bad.

4536
04:32:36,750 --> 04:32:39,850
Mint will go through hell to see two mentioned games.

4537
04:32:43,690 --> 04:32:46,370
Oh Murphy, thank you earlier for the hackadono.

4538
04:32:46,490 --> 04:32:47,350
Thank you so much!

4539
04:32:48,450 --> 04:32:49,870
The greatest rewards are born.

4540
04:32:50,430 --> 04:32:52,250
Oh, finish the unholy trinity.

4541
04:32:53,590 --> 04:32:55,750
Ending to a new journey.

4542
04:32:57,510 --> 04:32:59,910
The greatest rewards are born of the hardest trials.

4543
04:33:00,030 --> 04:33:03,110
Only sweat, tears, and grit with a little faith can get you to the end.

4544
04:33:03,230 --> 04:33:03,770
And your reward?

4545
04:33:03,910 --> 04:33:05,430
Peace, bragging rights, and an aka.

4546
04:33:06,570 --> 04:33:07,390
Thank you, villain.

4547
04:33:10,370 --> 04:33:11,170
Wow, Johnny!

4548
04:33:11,950 --> 04:33:14,530
Thank you for the...

4549
04:33:15,910 --> 04:33:17,210
Wait, what the hell is this?

4550
04:33:17,770 --> 04:33:19,470
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted!

4551
04:33:19,570 --> 04:33:19,950
Thank you!

4552
04:33:20,090 --> 04:33:22,350
And lost in the story, thank you so much for the 20 gifted!

4553
04:33:22,950 --> 04:33:24,330
Thanks for the perk!

4554
04:33:26,050 --> 04:33:27,250
Congratulations on the true ending.

4555
04:33:27,350 --> 04:33:28,050
Thanks, Kyle!

4556
04:33:28,610 --> 04:33:29,290
She gave it to us.

4557
04:33:29,350 --> 04:33:30,030
Thanks, Dawn!

4558
04:33:30,610 --> 04:33:32,510
This thing just popped up on my YouTube.

4559
04:33:32,730 --> 04:33:33,470
It says goal.

4560
04:33:34,330 --> 04:33:36,530
Make Super Chat more fun with a goal.

4561
04:33:36,730 --> 04:33:37,310
What the hell is this?

4562
04:33:37,390 --> 04:33:40,510
Set a goal to engage your audience in a new way.

4563
04:33:41,710 --> 04:33:44,150
Once you reach your goal, celebrate with your community.

4564
04:33:44,770 --> 04:33:48,770
Okay, if I get one Super Chat of $2...

4565
04:33:48,770 --> 04:33:50,690
In 15 minutes.

4566
04:33:50,930 --> 04:33:52,350
Share how you'll celebrate.

4567
04:34:00,640 --> 04:34:03,920
What is... Hold on, you guys have to tell me what this looks like.

4568
04:34:04,480 --> 04:34:05,500
What is this?

4569
04:34:05,780 --> 04:34:06,720
Do you guys see this?

4570
04:34:14,200 --> 04:34:16,800
It's not telling me if we made the goal or not.

4571
04:34:21,030 --> 04:34:24,050
Why isn't it telling me if we made the goal or not?

4572
04:34:24,110 --> 04:34:25,430
You guys are Super Chatting.

4573
04:34:25,450 --> 04:34:26,250
I think it's broken.

4574
04:34:27,710 --> 04:34:28,850
We did it!

4575
04:34:50,960 --> 04:34:52,820
What a stupid feature.

4576
04:34:53,200 --> 04:34:57,160
It literally just popped up as I was looking at the stream.

4577
04:34:58,400 --> 04:34:59,420
Best stream ever!

4578
04:35:01,960 --> 04:35:04,980
You guys are all just Super Chatting.

4579
04:35:08,230 --> 04:35:10,890
Yeah, it feels like a Twitch feature, doesn't it?

4580
04:35:11,170 --> 04:35:12,530
It's a not-hype stream.

4581
04:35:12,670 --> 04:35:13,870
These are kind of crazy though.

4582
04:35:13,870 --> 04:35:15,930
Because if I set another goal...

4583
04:35:15,930 --> 04:35:19,650
I can pick a goal of 50 Super Chats.

4584
04:35:20,310 --> 04:35:22,130
And I can pick red and higher.

4585
04:35:22,490 --> 04:35:24,010
What do you mean and higher?

4586
04:35:25,210 --> 04:35:29,270
And then I can set a timer of 15 minutes to 3 hours.

4587
04:35:29,490 --> 04:35:30,910
And then I share how... Oh, let's see.

4588
04:35:31,030 --> 04:35:32,430
Get inspired with examples.

4589
04:35:33,610 --> 04:35:35,010
Here are some ideas for you.

4590
04:35:35,350 --> 04:35:39,710
If we reach 10 Super Chats, I'll react to hilarious animal videos.

4591
04:35:40,730 --> 04:35:41,690
YouTube, no!

4592
04:35:41,890 --> 04:35:44,670
Last time I did that, I got a strike on my channel.

4593
04:35:45,170 --> 04:35:46,630
What are you talking about?

4594
04:35:47,870 --> 04:35:51,730
If we reach 10 Super Chats, I'll play the next game blindfolded.

4595
04:35:51,890 --> 04:35:53,090
No, I won't.

4596
04:35:53,450 --> 04:35:56,310
If we reach 10 Super Chats, I'll spill a secret.

4597
04:35:57,230 --> 04:35:58,630
Oh my gosh.

4598
04:35:59,630 --> 04:36:01,530
Thank you, I feel very inspired.

4599
04:36:04,510 --> 04:36:06,030
This is so funny.

4600
04:36:06,030 --> 04:36:06,090
This is so funny.

4601
04:36:10,560 --> 04:36:12,940
We know Zoo Camp scares you, Minto.

4602
04:36:13,040 --> 04:36:13,520
It's okay.

4603
04:36:14,300 --> 04:36:16,140
No, it's the spy animals.

4604
04:36:17,580 --> 04:36:19,640
YouTube is turning more into Twitch every day.

4605
04:36:19,920 --> 04:36:23,760
I don't mind some of the Twitch features as long as...

4606
04:36:23,760 --> 04:36:28,700
As long as the Twitch culture doesn't show up, I think.

4607
04:36:31,340 --> 04:36:33,860
You know, some of them are good, I think.

4608
04:36:34,000 --> 04:36:35,940
I think, you know...

4609
04:36:37,440 --> 04:36:37,920
But...

4610
04:36:37,920 --> 04:36:40,600
I think this one just encourages you to donate.

4611
04:36:42,340 --> 04:36:44,940
I usually have to tell you guys to not do that.

4612
04:36:46,700 --> 04:36:47,660
Animated emotes.

4613
04:36:47,720 --> 04:36:48,540
Yeah, see?

4614
04:36:48,760 --> 04:36:50,160
That's great on Twitch.

4615
04:36:50,320 --> 04:36:51,880
And the animated emotes.

4616
04:36:53,820 --> 04:36:55,860
I know, I haven't ever even commissioned any.

4617
04:36:55,960 --> 04:36:57,520
Because I'm like, what's the point?

4618
04:36:58,300 --> 04:36:59,400
Minto's secret funds.

4619
04:37:00,660 --> 04:37:02,440
Rest in Aura, welcome to membership.

4620
04:37:02,640 --> 04:37:03,160
Thank you.

4621
04:37:03,160 --> 04:37:06,160
Oh my god, bone removal expert.

4622
04:37:08,680 --> 04:37:15,060
I wish they'd fix chat using 18 gigs of RAM instead of adding more features.

4623
04:37:16,000 --> 04:37:16,980
So true.

4624
04:37:19,160 --> 04:37:21,500
But don't worry guys, I don't plan on going to Twitch.

4625
04:37:23,620 --> 04:37:24,140
So...

4626
04:37:24,900 --> 04:37:25,780
What was that?

4627
04:37:25,900 --> 04:37:26,240
Donate?

4628
04:37:26,320 --> 04:37:27,060
Yes, my lord.

4629
04:37:27,060 --> 04:37:27,360
No!

4630
04:37:27,980 --> 04:37:28,480
Get Aura!

4631
04:37:30,940 --> 04:37:34,080
I actually was talking about it with someone recently.

4632
04:37:34,400 --> 04:37:36,560
And they were like, you know...

4633
04:37:37,740 --> 04:37:40,440
They were like, you know...

4634
04:37:41,500 --> 04:37:45,620
If you had to choose, would you go from Twitch or YouTube?

4635
04:37:45,960 --> 04:37:46,900
Or which would you pick?

4636
04:37:46,940 --> 04:37:49,300
And I was like, no, I think I'm gonna...

4637
04:37:49,900 --> 04:37:52,280
I think I'm gonna...

4638
04:37:52,820 --> 04:37:54,280
Stay on YouTube.

4639
04:37:57,060 --> 04:37:58,300
I think like, if I...

4640
04:37:58,960 --> 04:37:59,880
Hold on.

4641
04:38:00,800 --> 04:38:03,340
I think if I were...

4642
04:38:03,340 --> 04:38:05,060
I think rather... Hold on, let me...

4643
04:38:05,820 --> 04:38:06,380
If...

4644
04:38:06,380 --> 04:38:10,580
For smaller VTubers, I'm pretty sure Twitch is better to start out on.

4645
04:38:13,960 --> 04:38:15,700
I hate the ads on Twitch.

4646
04:38:15,780 --> 04:38:16,380
I know!

4647
04:38:16,660 --> 04:38:18,080
They're so bad!

4648
04:38:18,280 --> 04:38:24,720
And then every other day I see something about another VTuber getting banned for some arbitrary reason.

4649
04:38:24,860 --> 04:38:25,580
It's crazy.

4650
04:38:27,460 --> 04:38:27,960
And...

4651
04:38:27,960 --> 04:38:33,060
But I think Twitch is better for visibility on...

4652
04:38:34,080 --> 04:38:35,340
For newer VTubers.

4653
04:38:35,540 --> 04:38:37,080
But, you know, I started on YouTube.

4654
04:38:38,740 --> 04:38:39,740
Even though...

4655
04:38:39,740 --> 04:38:43,220
No one else really that I knew at the time was on YouTube.

4656
04:38:43,360 --> 04:38:44,460
I was like the only one.

4657
04:38:44,520 --> 04:38:45,860
All my friends were on Twitch.

4658
04:38:47,000 --> 04:38:48,420
So it was a little weird.

4659
04:38:52,720 --> 04:38:53,220
But...

4660
04:38:54,180 --> 04:38:55,180
You know...

4661
04:38:55,180 --> 04:38:57,180
I think, obviously, I'm way more...

4662
04:38:57,720 --> 04:39:01,640
In a privileged position than most, you know, indie VTubers.

4663
04:39:03,460 --> 04:39:04,080
Because...

4664
04:39:04,080 --> 04:39:05,180
You know...

4665
04:39:06,240 --> 04:39:06,860
I...

4666
04:39:07,560 --> 04:39:08,760
Came from heaven.

4667
04:39:09,640 --> 04:39:10,260
So...

4668
04:39:10,260 --> 04:39:15,120
I have more reason to stay on YouTube than other people, maybe.

4669
04:39:15,680 --> 04:39:18,020
I don't think I would've still started on Twitch though.

4670
04:39:18,120 --> 04:39:19,190
I don't know, it just doesn't...

4671
04:39:19,940 --> 04:39:21,190
Feels different than...

4672
04:39:23,100 --> 04:39:23,410
Than...

4673
04:39:24,510 --> 04:39:25,430
I don't know.

4674
04:39:25,550 --> 04:39:27,710
I just don't understand the Twitch culture.

4675
04:39:27,830 --> 04:39:29,850
But I do watch some Twitch streamers.

4676
04:39:30,670 --> 04:39:32,750
I also really enjoy having VODs.

4677
04:39:33,090 --> 04:39:34,430
I love that so much.

4678
04:39:34,690 --> 04:39:36,670
Twitch VODs are just not the same.

4679
04:39:39,330 --> 04:39:41,330
I enjoy having VODs so much.

4680
04:39:42,970 --> 04:39:43,490
But...

4681
04:39:43,490 --> 04:39:45,530
I watch some Twitch streamers.

4682
04:39:45,750 --> 04:39:47,470
And then I watch like, you know, some other V...

4683
04:39:47,470 --> 04:39:48,470
Like VT...

4684
04:39:48,470 --> 04:39:50,230
I say streamers.

4685
04:39:50,290 --> 04:39:52,070
I watch one Twitch streamer and then...

4686
04:39:53,410 --> 04:39:55,430
But they also simulcast to YouTube.

4687
04:39:55,710 --> 04:39:57,110
So it's like, why not even?

4688
04:39:59,490 --> 04:40:00,610
Raichi, thank you!

4689
04:40:00,770 --> 04:40:01,490
Great gaming, Minto!

4690
04:40:01,590 --> 04:40:02,150
You're so brave!

4691
04:40:02,390 --> 04:40:02,670
Amen!

4692
04:40:02,990 --> 04:40:03,790
Thank you, Raichi!

4693
04:40:04,330 --> 04:40:05,710
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4694
04:40:07,710 --> 04:40:09,750
And thank you for the...

4695
04:40:10,610 --> 04:40:11,130
Akadono...

4696
04:40:11,130 --> 04:40:11,410
Offstream...

4697
04:40:11,930 --> 04:40:12,270
Yesterday!

4698
04:40:12,510 --> 04:40:13,350
I really appreciate it!

4699
04:40:13,350 --> 04:40:14,610
I'm glad you enjoyed the karaoke!

4700
04:40:15,050 --> 04:40:15,710
Thank you!

4701
04:40:17,430 --> 04:40:18,390
Mm-hmm.

4702
04:40:22,390 --> 04:40:24,410
I mean the roaches on Twitch.

4703
04:40:24,530 --> 04:40:25,410
Yeah, that's...

4704
04:40:25,410 --> 04:40:25,890
I...

4705
04:40:25,890 --> 04:40:27,110
That's her preference, you know?

4706
04:40:27,610 --> 04:40:29,170
Praise be for beating faith, my lord.

4707
04:40:29,270 --> 04:40:30,830
I'll start going to church just for you.

4708
04:40:31,330 --> 04:40:32,690
This must be the sign!

4709
04:40:35,650 --> 04:40:36,910
Only one Twitch streamer?

4710
04:40:36,990 --> 04:40:37,250
Sorry!

4711
04:40:37,470 --> 04:40:39,710
The streamer is a flesh streamer.

4712
04:40:40,530 --> 04:40:41,050
Oh my god.

4713
04:40:41,570 --> 04:40:44,210
But I watch a couple VTubers on...

4714
04:40:44,210 --> 04:40:44,950
On Twitch.

4715
04:40:44,950 --> 04:40:47,050
Whoever is kind of like streaming and stuff.

4716
04:40:51,840 --> 04:40:54,640
Should a person switch from...

4717
04:40:55,010 --> 04:40:56,260
From Twitch to YouTube?

4718
04:40:57,140 --> 04:40:58,400
I don't know.

4719
04:40:59,260 --> 04:41:02,580
I always was on YouTube, so I stayed on YouTube.

4720
04:41:04,010 --> 04:41:06,280
I think it would be hard to switch...

4721
04:41:06,940 --> 04:41:07,980
One way or the other.

4722
04:41:08,420 --> 04:41:09,280
I think like...

4723
04:41:09,800 --> 04:41:12,600
All your audience won't follow, you know?

4724
04:41:13,920 --> 04:41:14,620
Like...

4725
04:41:15,480 --> 04:41:16,180
Flesh.

4726
04:41:16,840 --> 04:41:18,940
Is it Phasmofleshman also on YouTube now?

4727
04:41:19,040 --> 04:41:19,320
Yeah!

4728
04:41:19,660 --> 04:41:20,300
That's the streamer!

4729
04:41:20,820 --> 04:41:21,960
His name is Insim.

4730
04:41:24,020 --> 04:41:24,540
I really...

4731
04:41:24,540 --> 04:41:26,620
I fall asleep to his videos all the time.

4732
04:41:26,680 --> 04:41:28,380
And he streams in the middle of the day.

4733
04:41:28,480 --> 04:41:31,040
So I watch him while I'm like working on stuff too.

4734
04:41:33,300 --> 04:41:35,120
Thank you for pushing through the final boss.

4735
04:41:35,160 --> 04:41:35,780
You did so good.

4736
04:41:35,840 --> 04:41:36,560
Thank you!

4737
04:41:37,060 --> 04:41:37,460
Speedpandy!

4738
04:41:37,680 --> 04:41:40,200
Sorry for getting dramatic in the middle, you guys.

4739
04:41:40,780 --> 04:41:41,440
I'm so sorry.

4740
04:41:41,520 --> 04:41:42,820
I don't know why I got so frustrated.

4741
04:41:44,720 --> 04:41:45,920
I think it's...

4742
04:41:46,180 --> 04:41:47,000
I'm tired.

4743
04:41:51,180 --> 04:41:52,600
I think I'm just sleepy.

4744
04:41:57,150 --> 04:41:58,790
I'm so sorry for getting dramatic.

4745
04:41:59,850 --> 04:42:01,010
I got really dramatic.

4746
04:42:01,230 --> 04:42:03,630
I got so frustrated I cried.

4747
04:42:04,170 --> 04:42:05,030
But it even wasn't...

4748
04:42:05,030 --> 04:42:05,770
I didn't even...

4749
04:42:05,770 --> 04:42:07,330
I was only at it for a half hour.

4750
04:42:09,630 --> 04:42:11,450
I wasn't even at it for that long.

4751
04:42:11,510 --> 04:42:13,990
It took me like 35-40 minutes to...

4752
04:42:13,990 --> 04:42:14,990
Because I remember...

4753
04:42:15,510 --> 04:42:17,370
Right before the fight, it said...

4754
04:42:17,370 --> 04:42:20,110
I was like, oh my gosh, I've almost been streaming for 4 hours.

4755
04:42:20,550 --> 04:42:23,930
And then, I beat it in like 30 minutes.

4756
04:42:24,290 --> 04:42:25,370
I'm so dramatic.

4757
04:42:25,770 --> 04:42:26,730
I'm so sorry.

4758
04:42:32,830 --> 04:42:34,810
A long ass half hour.

4759
04:42:35,030 --> 04:42:36,470
I know, right?

4760
04:42:36,870 --> 04:42:37,390
Gosh.

4761
04:42:37,630 --> 04:42:39,570
Yeah, I was tired of all of Gary's shit.

4762
04:42:39,830 --> 04:42:42,090
I was tired of taking it from him.

4763
04:42:42,310 --> 04:42:43,450
I did everything.

4764
04:42:43,770 --> 04:42:45,930
I did everything to get to that guy.

4765
04:42:45,930 --> 04:42:46,930
And then, he's just like...

4766
04:42:46,930 --> 04:42:48,250
I'm gonna split into two.

4767
04:42:48,430 --> 04:42:49,870
And one of them is gonna shoot arrows.

4768
04:42:50,410 --> 04:42:52,610
And I'm gonna chase after you sometimes.

4769
04:42:53,270 --> 04:42:55,310
And sometimes, I'm gonna creep at you.

4770
04:42:56,670 --> 04:42:58,210
And then, the lady...

4771
04:42:58,210 --> 04:42:58,630
Oh my gosh.

4772
04:42:58,790 --> 04:43:00,050
The fact that the note...

4773
04:43:01,750 --> 04:43:03,070
The fact that the note...

4774
04:43:04,130 --> 04:43:07,830
Is the only way to know that you need to set yourself on fire during that part...

4775
04:43:07,830 --> 04:43:10,810
And run at her is so...

4776
04:43:12,550 --> 04:43:14,370
Oh my gosh.

4777
04:43:14,370 --> 04:43:16,990
It was a long stream and a hard boss, but you came through.

4778
04:43:17,450 --> 04:43:17,630
Yeah.

4779
04:43:18,410 --> 04:43:19,610
Gary does not love you.

4780
04:43:19,690 --> 04:43:20,550
Really rubbed it in.

4781
04:43:20,670 --> 04:43:21,210
Oh, right.

4782
04:43:23,830 --> 04:43:26,170
And then, I'm taking you to get so killed for a bit.

4783
04:43:30,050 --> 04:43:32,290
I don't think I ever would've remembered.

4784
04:43:33,730 --> 04:43:35,190
Oh, thank you guys for telling me.

4785
04:43:35,470 --> 04:43:36,510
I would've never remembered.

4786
04:43:36,870 --> 04:43:38,490
I thought this game was awesome.

4787
04:43:38,690 --> 04:43:39,010
Good job.

4788
04:43:39,090 --> 04:43:40,130
My birthday is on Halloween.

4789
04:43:40,530 --> 04:43:42,090
But I don't want to interrupt your re-debut.

4790
04:43:42,230 --> 04:43:43,190
Can I get a happy birthday today?

4791
04:43:43,190 --> 04:43:44,670
Of course, Senpai!

4792
04:43:45,430 --> 04:43:46,750
Oh, I'm sorry.

4793
04:43:47,470 --> 04:43:48,300
That I won't...

4794
04:43:49,090 --> 04:43:51,520
I will say though, on Halloween...

4795
04:43:51,910 --> 04:43:54,440
I'll give a generalized happy birthday...

4796
04:43:55,840 --> 04:43:58,790
To all of the Halloween babies.

4797
04:43:59,730 --> 04:44:02,290
Happy birthday to you.

4798
04:44:02,610 --> 04:44:04,870
Happy birthday to you.

4799
04:44:05,330 --> 04:44:07,410
Happy birthday, Senpai.

4800
04:44:09,250 --> 04:44:11,670
Happy birthday to you.

4801
04:44:13,530 --> 04:44:14,910
And happy Halloween.

4802
04:44:18,740 --> 04:44:19,420
Thanks for the streams.

4803
04:44:19,560 --> 04:44:20,960
Been having a blast being a part of them.

4804
04:44:21,060 --> 04:44:21,780
Proud to be a new Wisp.

4805
04:44:22,500 --> 04:44:22,940
Nevermore!

4806
04:44:23,080 --> 04:44:23,740
Thank you!

4807
04:44:24,680 --> 04:44:25,980
Happy to have you here.

4808
04:44:26,560 --> 04:44:28,820
Everybody, be nice to the new Wisps, okay?

4809
04:44:31,260 --> 04:44:32,140
Be nice.

4810
04:44:32,400 --> 04:44:35,500
You guys, you know how difficult it is to not...

4811
04:44:36,200 --> 04:44:36,800
Oh my gosh.

4812
04:44:36,920 --> 04:44:38,740
To not just be like, screw the debut.

4813
04:44:38,740 --> 04:44:41,580
I'm gonna stream with my new form now!

4814
04:44:41,880 --> 04:44:43,340
Do you know how difficult it is?

4815
04:44:44,220 --> 04:44:45,780
I just have to wait a couple days.

4816
04:44:46,120 --> 04:44:46,520
What's today?

4817
04:44:46,820 --> 04:44:48,340
Okay, it's almost Tuesday.

4818
04:44:48,720 --> 04:44:51,060
Tuesday, Wednesday, and then Thursday!

4819
04:44:52,680 --> 04:44:53,340
Oh my gosh.

4820
04:44:53,780 --> 04:44:54,580
Huggy night!

4821
04:44:55,060 --> 04:44:56,040
Welcome to membership!

4822
04:44:57,620 --> 04:44:59,080
Yeah, it's all done.

4823
04:44:59,460 --> 04:45:00,120
The new model.

4824
04:45:00,260 --> 04:45:01,300
Yeah, it's all done.

4825
04:45:01,720 --> 04:45:03,260
My new form.

4826
04:45:03,820 --> 04:45:07,980
But, I'm still waiting on two pretty big things.

4827
04:45:08,740 --> 04:45:10,220
I think they'll be done in time.

4828
04:45:10,960 --> 04:45:12,320
I think they'll be done in time.

4829
04:45:13,740 --> 04:45:15,480
I finished up something today.

4830
04:45:15,880 --> 04:45:17,560
That I was able to work on...

4831
04:45:17,560 --> 04:45:19,860
That I was going to work on...

4832
04:45:20,580 --> 04:45:20,980
Tuesday.

4833
04:45:21,600 --> 04:45:27,720
I was gonna work on it Tuesday, but since I got sick, I was able to work on it during the weekend, so I was able to finish it up.

4834
04:45:29,420 --> 04:45:33,040
What if you streamed with just the silhouette of the new model for the last few minutes?

4835
04:45:36,040 --> 04:45:37,540
But, like, you can't see anything.

4836
04:45:40,040 --> 04:45:42,580
It's just real bad though, because it's not a new outfit.

4837
04:45:44,300 --> 04:45:46,860
So, it's not like a new outfit or anything.

4838
04:45:49,380 --> 04:45:50,260
Too risky.

4839
04:45:51,600 --> 04:45:52,980
Nah, we'll wait.

4840
04:45:53,680 --> 04:45:54,960
We'll wait, it's just a couple days.

4841
04:45:57,160 --> 04:45:58,820
It could be a trap.

4842
04:46:02,590 --> 04:46:06,010
It's not a new outfit, it's not maybe the most exciting, but...

4843
04:46:06,010 --> 04:46:08,230
I feel like I've been...

4844
04:46:08,230 --> 04:46:10,590
I've looked like this for so many years now.

4845
04:46:10,970 --> 04:46:12,330
Well, I guess...

4846
04:46:13,090 --> 04:46:15,210
It's been like...

4847
04:46:15,210 --> 04:46:17,090
It's been like...

4848
04:46:17,090 --> 04:46:19,630
Not years, but like years.

4849
04:46:19,770 --> 04:46:20,250
You know what I mean?

4850
04:46:20,510 --> 04:46:23,270
Because I was gone, but I came back.

4851
04:46:23,470 --> 04:46:27,030
I actually didn't even get to stream this much with Mint 2.0...

4852
04:46:27,810 --> 04:46:29,550
Before I left, so...

4853
04:46:29,550 --> 04:46:32,030
Honestly, it's been nice to be able to use it.

4854
04:46:33,110 --> 04:46:33,610
But...

4855
04:46:33,610 --> 04:46:36,990
I did see someone kind of mention something.

4856
04:46:37,310 --> 04:46:38,850
That was like...

4857
04:46:38,850 --> 04:46:40,810
They commented on one of my posts.

4858
04:46:42,270 --> 04:46:45,050
When I was like, oh yeah, my...

4859
04:46:45,050 --> 04:46:46,130
Redebut is happening.

4860
04:46:46,790 --> 04:46:49,030
And they were like, please don't retire...

4861
04:46:49,650 --> 04:46:51,230
Mint 2.0...

4862
04:46:51,230 --> 04:46:52,550
Because, you know...

4863
04:46:52,550 --> 04:46:55,430
KGRmama worked really hard on it and...

4864
04:46:55,430 --> 04:46:58,530
Matara, you know, the rigging was a gift from Matara.

4865
04:46:59,390 --> 04:46:59,890
And...

4866
04:46:59,890 --> 04:47:02,310
You know...

4867
04:47:02,670 --> 04:47:04,290
I talked to KGRmama.

4868
04:47:04,650 --> 04:47:06,350
I actually...

4869
04:47:06,350 --> 04:47:08,890
Before the announcement and everything, I said...

4870
04:47:10,950 --> 04:47:14,310
You know, I let her know that...

4871
04:47:14,850 --> 04:47:16,510
I would be getting a new mama.

4872
04:47:18,810 --> 04:47:22,030
And she was very okay with it.

4873
04:47:22,090 --> 04:47:24,970
I think the thing with KGRmama was that...

4874
04:47:24,970 --> 04:47:27,290
And it happened with this model as well.

4875
04:47:27,290 --> 04:47:31,870
Sometimes, I think her condition is kind of bad.

4876
04:47:32,590 --> 04:47:33,810
And she gets a lot of commissions.

4877
04:47:34,110 --> 04:47:36,650
And she was very busy and stuff, so...

4878
04:47:36,650 --> 04:47:39,510
It would be hard, I think, to continue...

4879
04:47:40,470 --> 04:47:40,910
With...

4880
04:47:40,910 --> 04:47:44,070
You know, KGRmama's art is so cute and so great.

4881
04:47:45,590 --> 04:47:48,370
It would be hard to continue, I think...

4882
04:47:49,790 --> 04:47:50,230
Having...

4883
04:47:50,230 --> 04:47:51,550
Being with KGRmama.

4884
04:47:51,790 --> 04:47:54,470
But of course, you know, I'm always going to appreciate her.

4885
04:47:54,470 --> 04:47:54,910
And...

4886
04:47:56,370 --> 04:47:58,570
You know, thank her for birthing me...

4887
04:47:59,390 --> 04:48:00,730
In my original form.

4888
04:48:01,710 --> 04:48:02,870
She was sick recently too.

4889
04:48:03,030 --> 04:48:04,950
Yeah, I know, so...

4890
04:48:04,950 --> 04:48:06,850
I don't want to obviously be like...

4891
04:48:06,850 --> 04:48:07,610
Please, new outfit!

4892
04:48:07,710 --> 04:48:08,290
Please, new outfit!

4893
04:48:08,390 --> 04:48:08,930
Please, new outfit!

4894
04:48:09,090 --> 04:48:11,550
And then, you know, it wouldn't be fair for her...

4895
04:48:12,310 --> 04:48:14,510
For me to kind of push that kind of stuff.

4896
04:48:14,630 --> 04:48:18,290
And if I were to say I decided a date that I wanted to debut on...

4897
04:48:18,290 --> 04:48:21,410
It wouldn't be fair to you guys to be like...

4898
04:48:21,410 --> 04:48:23,990
Okay, I announced it and then I have to push it back.

4899
04:48:23,990 --> 04:48:25,990
Or things like that, you know, so...

4900
04:48:26,510 --> 04:48:28,450
And that's one reason I made this decision.

4901
04:48:28,750 --> 04:48:31,730
And then as for the gift from Matara...

4902
04:48:33,570 --> 04:48:34,010
Actually...

4903
04:48:35,010 --> 04:48:36,910
For, you know...

4904
04:48:37,890 --> 04:48:40,050
Having Kevin do the rigging...

4905
04:48:40,050 --> 04:48:42,870
It was mostly because it was like a time thing.

4906
04:48:44,070 --> 04:48:46,690
I was totally okay with coming back...

4907
04:48:46,690 --> 04:48:48,590
With my original rigging.

4908
04:48:48,690 --> 04:48:52,590
And Matara was like, no, no, no, you should be like new and shiny and don't worry about it.

4909
04:48:53,270 --> 04:48:55,330
But it was kind of like a...

4910
04:48:55,330 --> 04:48:57,790
It was like almost a last minute decision.

4911
04:48:58,050 --> 04:48:58,610
Like, we were...

4912
04:48:58,610 --> 04:49:01,170
Like, Kevin was able to do it in like a month.

4913
04:49:02,410 --> 04:49:02,890
So...

4914
04:49:03,950 --> 04:49:06,550
We just needed someone to kind of do it quickly.

4915
04:49:07,110 --> 04:49:09,470
And Matara, of course, is totally okay.

4916
04:49:09,730 --> 04:49:11,530
She loves the new model.

4917
04:49:12,070 --> 04:49:12,550
She...

4918
04:49:14,310 --> 04:49:16,430
She is really excited for me.

4919
04:49:16,670 --> 04:49:18,790
And so, you know...

4920
04:49:18,790 --> 04:49:21,350
She's not at all offended, you know.

4921
04:49:21,350 --> 04:49:26,810
That I decided to not use the rigging that she got for me.

4922
04:49:26,970 --> 04:49:29,570
Like, she did it because she wanted to.

4923
04:49:30,050 --> 04:49:33,650
It wasn't like me being like, oh, I wish I had new rigging.

4924
04:49:33,970 --> 04:49:35,630
You know, it was like...

4925
04:49:37,830 --> 04:49:38,270
Her...

4926
04:49:39,550 --> 04:49:41,390
Yeah, it was like her...

4927
04:49:41,390 --> 04:49:43,390
Just kind of being like, oh...

4928
04:49:43,390 --> 04:49:46,950
I want you to have this so that, you know, you feel like you are updated.

4929
04:49:49,310 --> 04:49:49,750
So...

4930
04:49:49,750 --> 04:49:50,350
Yeah.

4931
04:49:52,130 --> 04:49:52,770
So...

4932
04:49:52,770 --> 04:49:54,750
You know, don't think that...

4933
04:49:54,750 --> 04:49:57,550
And even though I won't use this form anymore.

4934
04:49:58,810 --> 04:50:00,790
Don't think that I am like...

4935
04:50:01,770 --> 04:50:03,470
Throwing away my past.

4936
04:50:04,210 --> 04:50:05,750
Don't think I'm like...

4937
04:50:07,410 --> 04:50:08,050
Not...

4938
04:50:08,790 --> 04:50:13,770
Appreciating, of course, what I was given and the people I worked with.

4939
04:50:18,770 --> 04:50:19,410
So...

4940
04:50:19,410 --> 04:50:22,770
Have you considered doing Vinny's community game, ChoicerVoicer?

4941
04:50:23,430 --> 04:50:26,990
It has Metal Gear, Troll 2, and I think Neil Breen packs.

4942
04:50:27,630 --> 04:50:28,530
What the hell is that?

4943
04:50:29,870 --> 04:50:30,890
Well, check it out.

4944
04:50:31,010 --> 04:50:31,650
Thank you.

4945
04:50:33,210 --> 04:50:37,070
Vinny's community game, ChoicerVoicer.

4946
04:50:38,630 --> 04:50:39,950
We're not forgetting KGR.

4947
04:50:40,150 --> 04:50:41,510
We can grow and still love her work.

4948
04:50:41,630 --> 04:50:44,650
And I just know Mataro wants to see you develop your channel further.

4949
04:50:45,510 --> 04:50:46,310
Thank you.

4950
04:50:49,940 --> 04:50:51,040
Oh, it's okay.

4951
04:50:51,120 --> 04:50:52,340
I love the current outfit anyway.

4952
04:50:53,140 --> 04:50:54,240
It's the same outfit.

4953
04:50:55,760 --> 04:50:58,700
Just a little different.

4954
04:50:59,280 --> 04:51:01,800
I saw a cosplayer that was just like...

4955
04:51:01,800 --> 04:51:03,060
Here is my cosplay before...

4956
04:51:03,860 --> 04:51:04,740
It's outdated.

4957
04:51:05,600 --> 04:51:07,320
And honestly, I was just like...

4958
04:51:07,320 --> 04:51:09,060
The only thing you have to change is like...

4959
04:51:09,800 --> 04:51:10,740
Not a lot.

4960
04:51:12,220 --> 04:51:13,860
It's basically the same outfit.

4961
04:51:16,540 --> 04:51:17,880
No leotard though.

4962
04:51:18,480 --> 04:51:20,860
Instead, there is...

4963
04:51:25,240 --> 04:51:29,900
Can we get a goofy smile meant one last time before re-debut?

4964
04:51:30,080 --> 04:51:31,260
What do you mean by that?

4965
04:51:31,640 --> 04:51:32,820
What is a goofy smile?

4966
04:51:33,000 --> 04:51:34,860
Oh, like the wide smile?

4967
04:51:36,760 --> 04:51:37,300
5.

4968
04:51:39,060 --> 04:51:39,360
Oh my gosh.

4969
04:51:39,380 --> 04:51:40,000
Thank you for the gifted.

4970
04:51:40,220 --> 04:51:40,900
Oh my gosh, sorry.

4971
04:51:41,320 --> 04:51:42,160
I can't read.

4972
04:51:42,660 --> 04:51:43,540
Thank you.

4973
04:51:44,640 --> 04:51:46,160
My wide smile.

4974
04:51:46,260 --> 04:51:48,260
Hold on, I think actually...

4975
04:51:48,260 --> 04:51:49,560
I think there is... Oh wait.

4976
04:51:50,560 --> 04:51:51,240
Hold on.

4977
04:51:55,200 --> 04:51:56,160
I think...

4978
04:51:57,600 --> 04:51:58,560
I think...

4979
04:51:59,140 --> 04:52:03,240
There is so many things that Kevin allowed me to do.

4980
04:52:03,560 --> 04:52:05,680
So many things that I was like...

4981
04:52:05,680 --> 04:52:07,120
I feel like...

4982
04:52:07,120 --> 04:52:11,320
For 3.0, I kind of really dialed it back with a lot of expressions.

4983
04:52:11,320 --> 04:52:15,400
Because I was like, I want to stick to the ones that I use the most.

4984
04:52:17,920 --> 04:52:20,320
But this one, he gave me...

4985
04:52:21,900 --> 04:52:23,200
Oh, that's kind of freaky.

4986
04:52:25,800 --> 04:52:28,320
I'm floating, I'm a floaty girl.

4987
04:52:32,580 --> 04:52:34,560
Let's see, what else did he give me?

4988
04:52:34,680 --> 04:52:37,320
Hold on, I have a way to make my...

4989
04:52:38,780 --> 04:52:40,320
To make my...

4990
04:52:42,000 --> 04:52:42,480
Mouth...

4991
04:52:42,480 --> 04:52:43,040
Big.

4992
04:52:43,640 --> 04:52:45,040
Like, I can even do this.

4993
04:52:46,140 --> 04:52:47,000
Oh, wait.

4994
04:52:47,240 --> 04:52:48,200
That's not what I meant to do.

4995
04:52:49,980 --> 04:52:52,020
But I never do this.

4996
04:52:54,860 --> 04:52:56,120
Oh, why am I big?

4997
04:52:56,460 --> 04:52:56,980
What happened?

4998
04:53:00,660 --> 04:53:01,140
And...

4999
04:53:01,900 --> 04:53:02,180
And...

5000
04:53:04,940 --> 04:53:06,640
Oh, like this?

5001
04:53:08,140 --> 04:53:09,560
Wait, that didn't work.

5002
04:53:09,820 --> 04:53:11,140
Nevermind, it didn't work.

5003
04:53:12,320 --> 04:53:14,100
I think my keyboard is not right.

5004
04:53:14,780 --> 04:53:15,260
Oh, whoops.

5005
04:53:20,120 --> 04:53:22,620
Have I ever showed you guys that I can sit?

5006
04:53:24,560 --> 04:53:25,320
Hold on.

5007
04:53:26,160 --> 04:53:27,540
I can even sit.

5008
04:53:33,470 --> 04:53:34,610
I can sit.

5009
04:53:34,610 --> 04:53:37,090
I can just like...

5010
04:53:37,090 --> 04:53:37,970
Chill here.

5011
04:53:38,650 --> 04:53:39,170
And sit.

5012
04:53:40,630 --> 04:53:41,730
I can just sit.

5013
04:53:42,410 --> 04:53:43,230
I'm a sitting duck.

5014
04:53:48,350 --> 04:53:49,950
I can just sit.

5015
04:53:53,190 --> 04:53:53,950
I'm just chilling.

5016
04:53:54,610 --> 04:53:55,490
What else can I do?

5017
04:53:58,230 --> 04:54:00,730
I can lean, but I think it's kind of freaky looking.

5018
04:54:00,730 --> 04:54:01,030
Goodness.

5019
04:54:03,670 --> 04:54:05,470
I think it's kind of freaky looking.

5020
04:54:06,750 --> 04:54:07,750
When I do the lean.

5021
04:54:08,550 --> 04:54:09,730
Wait, how do I do it?

5022
04:54:10,290 --> 04:54:10,710
Oh, here.

5023
04:54:13,150 --> 04:54:13,590
God!

5024
04:54:14,570 --> 04:54:15,010
Help!

5025
04:54:15,250 --> 04:54:16,290
Wait, how do I stop?

5026
04:54:34,930 --> 04:54:36,310
Oh my gosh.

5027
04:54:36,810 --> 04:54:38,550
I don't think it looks good with me.

5028
04:54:41,050 --> 04:54:42,310
So I never...

5029
04:54:42,310 --> 04:54:44,090
And then of course I can be a chibi.

5030
04:54:44,090 --> 04:54:44,970
Oh my god!

5031
04:55:03,120 --> 04:55:05,040
Wait, what if I lean like this?

5032
04:55:05,620 --> 04:55:07,260
Oh god!

5033
04:55:07,560 --> 04:55:08,980
It's so freaky.

5034
04:55:19,610 --> 04:55:20,610
I'm dying.

5035
04:55:21,110 --> 04:55:22,010
I'm already dead.

5036
04:55:22,090 --> 04:55:22,730
Oh here we go.

5037
04:55:22,930 --> 04:55:25,230
Oh my god, it's like an atrocity.

5038
04:55:26,830 --> 04:55:27,870
It's so...

5039
04:55:29,490 --> 04:55:30,910
It's like a monster.

5040
04:55:31,630 --> 04:55:32,790
Oh my gosh.

5041
04:55:33,070 --> 04:55:34,010
Oh this one though?

5042
04:55:34,070 --> 04:55:36,490
I never even asked for this, but...

5043
04:55:36,490 --> 04:55:37,610
This one is always cool.

5044
04:55:38,290 --> 04:55:40,750
That he just gave me this.

5045
04:55:44,190 --> 04:55:45,550
Thank you Kevin.

5046
04:55:48,490 --> 04:55:50,070
Wait, there was a way though.

5047
04:55:56,430 --> 04:55:57,950
I can't remember.

5048
04:56:09,690 --> 04:56:10,210
Oh...

5049
04:56:15,840 --> 04:56:16,360
Sleep?

5050
04:56:18,420 --> 04:56:18,940
What's this one?

5051
04:56:19,400 --> 04:56:20,200
Oh god!

5052
04:56:21,600 --> 04:56:22,400
Oh my god!

5053
04:56:22,680 --> 04:56:22,940
Wait!

5054
04:56:23,360 --> 04:56:24,780
That's not me you guys!

5055
04:56:25,200 --> 04:56:26,460
How do I wake up?

5056
04:56:37,190 --> 04:56:38,490
Oh my god!

5057
04:56:41,110 --> 04:56:41,630
I

5058
04:56:46,930 --> 04:56:50,290
thought there was a way guys, but maybe there wasn't.

5059
04:56:57,860 --> 04:56:58,540
Wait.

5060
04:56:58,900 --> 04:57:00,220
Oh my god, my mouth.

5061
04:57:00,360 --> 04:57:00,580
Wait.

5062
04:57:01,000 --> 04:57:01,720
Oh my god.

5063
04:57:03,060 --> 04:57:04,320
Is this what you wanted?

5064
04:57:05,600 --> 04:57:06,940
Is this...

5065
04:57:09,080 --> 04:57:11,140
Is this what you...

5066
04:57:17,200 --> 04:57:18,760
Is this what you wanted?

5067
04:57:21,760 --> 04:57:23,240
My mouth is...

5068
04:57:23,240 --> 04:57:24,400
Oh my god!

5069
04:57:25,060 --> 04:57:26,380
Oh my god!

5070
04:57:26,500 --> 04:57:27,420
You can see my...

5071
04:57:27,420 --> 04:57:29,780
Oh my god, it's disturbing.

5072
04:57:33,040 --> 04:57:35,960
Maybe I should have used this for my Halloween costume.

5073
04:57:44,870 --> 04:57:46,990
I think though...

5074
04:57:46,990 --> 04:57:48,590
It wasn't even this that...

5075
04:57:48,590 --> 04:57:51,750
This was not the reason that my mouth was so wide.

5076
04:57:52,310 --> 04:57:54,490
It was because I was using Gidi's computer.

5077
04:57:55,730 --> 04:57:57,730
I think Gidi enhances her mouth.

5078
04:57:57,850 --> 04:57:58,270
Onigiri.

5079
04:58:00,090 --> 04:58:01,810
This in the lean scares me so much.

5080
04:58:01,870 --> 04:58:02,510
Oh my gosh, wait.

5081
04:58:02,570 --> 04:58:03,770
What if I do this while I lean?

5082
04:58:03,990 --> 04:58:05,330
Ok, hold on.

5083
04:58:13,780 --> 04:58:14,580
Hey guys.

5084
04:58:15,340 --> 04:58:15,960
It's me.

5085
04:58:17,120 --> 04:58:17,520
Minto.

5086
04:58:19,220 --> 04:58:20,500
Hey, you gonna let me in?

5087
04:58:22,080 --> 04:58:23,240
You gonna let me...

5088
04:58:23,240 --> 04:58:23,940
Oh god!

5089
04:58:31,960 --> 04:58:32,360
Wow.

5090
04:58:32,360 --> 04:58:32,520
Wow.

5091
04:58:33,600 --> 04:58:36,840
Ok guys, well thank you for faith.

5092
04:58:37,880 --> 04:58:40,460
It's midnight for me, so I'm gonna go to sleep.

5093
04:58:41,120 --> 04:58:42,800
We got the good end.

5094
04:58:43,500 --> 04:58:44,640
We did it.

5095
04:58:48,040 --> 04:58:49,340
Did I just hop?

5096
04:58:50,640 --> 04:58:52,060
Oh my god.

5097
04:59:01,410 --> 04:59:02,410
She's bouncing.

5098
04:59:04,190 --> 04:59:05,010
I'm hopping.

5099
04:59:05,530 --> 04:59:06,070
I'm bouncing.

5100
04:59:10,150 --> 04:59:13,630
Sorry, I can't bounce in my 3.0.

5101
04:59:15,510 --> 04:59:19,690
But I have some other cute expressions I think you guys will enjoy.

5102
04:59:20,870 --> 04:59:23,010
I hope you guys enjoy the overall look.

5103
04:59:24,070 --> 04:59:25,290
I'm much more baby.

5104
04:59:26,030 --> 04:59:27,130
It's kind of crazy.

5105
04:59:27,690 --> 04:59:29,570
It's kind of crazy how baby I became.

5106
04:59:30,090 --> 04:59:30,710
I will become.

5107
04:59:32,930 --> 04:59:35,750
If you guys are just like, oh Minto cute now.

5108
04:59:36,450 --> 04:59:37,550
You don't even know.

5109
04:59:39,510 --> 04:59:41,230
You don't even know.

5110
04:59:47,710 --> 04:59:48,910
Omg Mint Phantom.

5111
04:59:49,110 --> 04:59:49,750
Omg Kuro.

5112
04:59:50,690 --> 04:59:51,610
Thanks for 2 months.

5113
04:59:54,490 --> 04:59:56,910
It will be a lot of fun.

5114
05:00:01,450 --> 05:00:03,310
Thanks for the stream and for showing off.

5115
05:00:04,370 --> 05:00:05,530
I love Spooky Mint.

5116
05:00:05,610 --> 05:00:06,330
Please do it again.

5117
05:00:07,710 --> 05:00:08,450
Hold on.

5118
05:00:13,870 --> 05:00:16,010
It's really good with this music.

5119
05:00:18,270 --> 05:00:21,070
Happy Halloween.

5120
05:00:24,850 --> 05:00:27,490
Sweet dreams.

5121
05:00:28,210 --> 05:00:29,930
Thanks for watching.

5122
05:00:31,710 --> 05:00:33,850
