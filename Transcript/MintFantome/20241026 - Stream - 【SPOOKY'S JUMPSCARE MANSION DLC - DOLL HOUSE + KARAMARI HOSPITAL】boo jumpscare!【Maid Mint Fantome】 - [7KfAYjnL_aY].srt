1
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,090
Hahahaha.

2
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,460
Screen's off center.

3
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,930
Oops.

4
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,310
My bad.

5
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:55,870
What?

6
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,390
Professional Vtuber, what are you talking about?

7
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,250
I'm Indie.

8
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,310
Duh.

9
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,730
Welcome home, Master.

10
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,750
Welcome.

11
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,750
Still get paid.

12
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,370
You get paid, don't you?

13
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,870
What if I...

14
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,790
Spend all the money I make?

15
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,930
What if I make money, but then I spend it all?

16
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,090
What if it's a net profit of zero?

17
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,180
She's cute again today.

18
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,820
What are you talking about?

19
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,300
I'm not cute.

20
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,760
But this is how I sound.

21
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,000
Orochi is irresponsible with her income.

22
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,280
Sounds like a doki situation.

23
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,680
I mean...

24
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,360
That's just way too much fun.

25
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,540
Spending money.

26
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,020
Oh my gosh, I was thinking about that today.

27
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,360
I was just like...

28
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,980
You know...

29
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,440
What would they do about my taxes?

30
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,480
If I made a bunch of money, but then I invested all the money back...

31
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,240
Into my streams.

32
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,800
Because I was like, oh gosh.

33
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,420
Okay, I had to...

34
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:34,740
Okay.

35
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,220
What if you spend all your money, just like me for real?

36
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,560
No!

37
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,300
Nexie!

38
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,160
Nexie, you literally... I saw you.

39
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,500
You literally sent an akasupa to doki last night.

40
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,680
Your money, please.

41
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,440
Hi, ghost lady.

42
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,420
Hi, Squidward.

43
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,760
Chat does reflect streamer.

44
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,040
Yeah, it's a business expense, Mr. Irisman.

45
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,600
I...

46
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,500
I was thinking about it because...

47
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:04,680
Okay.

48
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,360
I still have things to pay for.

49
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,140
Not everything is done for my debut.

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,060
I still have to pay two whole teams of people.

51
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,920
I paid...

52
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,580
You guys, I think my...

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,080
I think the rigging might be done today.

54
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,520
Oh...

55
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,340
Beast Wars Megatron was one of my first toys as a kid.

56
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,480
It's cool, but thoughts about...

57
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,100
No, sorry.

58
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,140
Beast Wars Megatron is my favorite.

59
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,640
But I also like to say Waspinator.

60
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,020
But it was worth it.

61
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,540
But your wallet!

62
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,600
Hayden, thank you for the 5 gifted!

63
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,600
You'll be next!

64
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,240
Welcome back for 6 months.

65
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,840
Thank you and Prince of Belka.

66
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,020
Welcome back!

67
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,040
Oh my gosh.

68
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:51,920
Belka.

69
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,640
The phantom income.

70
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,180
So I was like...

71
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,020
So I was like...

72
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,020
I was like, if I just like spend all my money...

73
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,020
On other things...

74
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,620
Then...

75
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,940
What would they do if they're just like...

76
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,760
If I'm like, hey, tax people, I have no money.

77
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,460
To give you money.

78
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,320
Because I spent it all on my business.

79
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,980
It's basically like a net profit of zero.

80
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:23,940
You know?

81
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,180
I'm not making any money.

82
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,600
It all goes back.

83
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,000
Consult an accountant.

84
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:32,820
No!

85
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,820
I have an accountant, don't worry.

86
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,360
Spoopy time.

87
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Spoopy time!

88
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,340
It's like recycling.

89
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,040
Yeah!

90
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,000
It's like recycling!

91
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,680
Look, my money is going to a cute ghost now.

92
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,000
Oops.

93
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,660
No!

94
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,260
Guys, I got like a new moisturizer.

95
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,320
For my ectoplasm.

96
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,340
And I don't think it works well with my...

97
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,300
With my... With me.

98
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,480
Actually, my face is burning.

99
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,260
And it has been all day.

100
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,780
Are you moist?

101
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,440
No!

102
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,440
I think maybe I'm having an allergic reaction.

103
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,620
I don't know.

104
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,040
I don't know.

105
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,820
Isn't that spooky?

106
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,240
Akira!

107
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,340
I went... I did like a face treatment recently.

108
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,020
They were like, you should use this moisturizer after it.

109
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,700
And I was like, okay.

110
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,980
I don't like the moisturizer.

111
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,120
It's not good.

112
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,380
Your honor, I assure you this $3000 spent on Metal Gear Merch is instrumental to my business.

113
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,800
If I show it on stream, it's a business expense.

114
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:08,920
Akira!

115
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,460
Welcome to the membership.

116
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,100
Thank you!

117
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,140
Anyways guys, welcome to...

118
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,520
Or welcome back, if you watched the first part.

119
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,940
Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion.

120
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,420
We played the main game.

121
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,260
We played the mansion some time ago.

122
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,460
So we should spend our money to get a net profit of 0 too.

123
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,140
Um...

124
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,840
Did you hear about the Over the Garden Wall concert on the 29th?

125
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,580
Yeah, I did.

126
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,420
I did hear about it.

127
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,920
Do you know why I trust trumpet players despite them always betraying me?

128
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,280
I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doot.

129
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,030
6 out of 10.

130
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,850
Dang, tough crowd.

131
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,170
Tough crowd.

132
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,790
Like a Jolly Rancher.

133
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,430
That don't impress me much.

134
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,210
Or rather the audience.

135
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,850
Anyway, like I said, we did the mansion.

136
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,410
So today we'll be doing Calamari Hospital and the Spooky's Dollhouse.

137
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,590
I think I did it the wrong order in the title.

138
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,210
My bad.

139
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,670
We will do it.

140
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:39,330
I like originally thought for some reason that these were like the longest ever.

141
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,650
I had blocked out like a ton of time initially.

142
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,850
I was like, oh, I think these are like 6 hours or something.

143
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,670
And then I was like, I tried to look it up on... I usually look up games on like...

144
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,430
What's it called?

145
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,610
How long to beat?

146
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,390
And then I add... I take the average and then I add like 2 or 3 hours to them.

147
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:05,010
And so I was just like... But the how long to beat only showed the full game.

148
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,250
So I was like...

149
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,790
I can't tell.

150
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,390
So then I looked it up on YouTube.

151
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,710
Because I was like, like I said, I was going to play this on Saturday and block out like...

152
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,730
I was like, oh my gosh, I'm going to do this and Devil May Cry, like 2 endurance streams.

153
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,670
I'm so spooky crazy.

154
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,970
But I looked it up and it was like 45 minutes.

155
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,890
I don't know how long the dollhouse one is.

156
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,730
But we finally get to know the story of the Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion.

157
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,330
So that's kind of cool.

158
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,230
Take Minto Paisen account.

159
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,190
Yeah, the times that I go to the bathroom.

160
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,930
The times that I talk.

161
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,190
And the times that I lose.

162
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,690
Dollhouse is longer, but it's still less than 2 hours.

163
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,310
So 45 minutes plus 2 hours, yeah.

164
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,370
We should be good.

165
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,570
Sorry again also, if you're watching the VOD, this probably doesn't mean much to you.

166
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,730
Unless you couldn't make it because I had to change the time.

167
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,950
I'm so sorry, something came up tonight that I was like...

168
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,470
I've got to make time for this.

169
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,170
So I apologize that I had to move it back.

170
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,810
I'm so sorry.

171
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,310
VOD watcher here.

172
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,990
I'm watching the VOD right now.

173
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,790
It's okay.

174
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,930
What do you mean okay?

175
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,570
Write to your streamer driver.

176
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,930
Your struber driver.

177
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,850
5 stars, please.

178
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,110
If I were an Uber driver, I would have nice...

179
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,850
Well, my car is not very nice.

180
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,130
But I would have the nice amenities.

181
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,310
I would have the charging cables.

182
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,750
And I would have the snacks.

183
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,050
Or little bottles of water.

184
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,890
I would have all of that.

185
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,030
Then you would rate me 5 stars.

186
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,050
3 out of 5, she hates us.

187
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,370
3 stars, talk during the trip.

188
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,100
Is that why...

189
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,420
Oh my gosh, there's probably people that actually are just like...

190
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,640
Gosh, I can't stand watching VTubers play games because they just talk through it.

191
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,480
Or their big heads take up a whole chunk of the screen.

192
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,860
VOD watchers, rewind 3 hours.

193
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,580
Thanks for the perk!

194
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,800
2016, the developer received a cease and desist letter from the company Spooky House Studios...

195
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,400
...who claimed the title Spooky's House of Jumpscares infringed on their trademark.

196
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,820
The game was renamed to Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion.

197
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,580
What?

198
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,160
That's so stinky.

199
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,940
Spooky House... What?

200
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,480
That's so stinky.

201
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,820
And of course you're gonna change it because a small indie dev is not gonna be able to afford a big lawyer...

202
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,540
...against a big company.

203
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,720
Stinky, stinky, stinky, stinky, stinky.

204
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,340
Really stinky.

205
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,640
Monster Energy tried suing a bunch of games that use the word monster.

206
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,240
Oh my gosh!

207
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,480
Yeah, PU.

208
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,320
We hate that.

209
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,460
That's why they changed the name.

210
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,460
I thought it was because it came out as 1.0.

211
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,040
I don't know.

212
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,040
Did you know this game was originally going to be Resident Evil 5?

213
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,860
Crazy!

214
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,680
Anyway, so I guess we start with Calamari Hospital.

215
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,840
Unlock the secrets of this strange abandoned hospital.

216
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,300
Let's get started!

217
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,820
Oh my gosh, this feels so familiar.

218
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,820
Every day is Wednesday.

219
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,860
We're on room...

220
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,440
...995.

221
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,120
Oh.

222
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,020
Flashing lights warning maybe?

223
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,660
Oh my goodness.

224
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,620
Is this guy gonna come?

225
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,340
Oh my goodness.

226
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,120
I guess I'll turn the audio up a little bit.

227
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,820
I think last time I played this people said that the audio was too low.

228
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,060
They were like, I can't hear anything.

229
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,680
So you guys get all the jump scares too.

230
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,320
Here we go.

231
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,580
We're in the hospital.

232
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,440
Surely in a place.

233
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,420
I wouldn't say hospital.

234
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,620
Oh my gosh.

235
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,760
I still have my axe.

236
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,060
I wouldn't say hospital, but...

237
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,220
I've got the stream muted.

238
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,180
No hiding in the comments VOD watchers.

239
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,220
I see you scrolling down there trying to avoid...

240
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,220
Also, this doesn't have any rooms written.

241
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,440
You're just like, scary game.

242
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,680
I better hide in the comments so nothing sees me.

243
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,240
I forgot I have stamina.

244
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,100
Alright.

245
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,840
Spooky!

246
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,340
Thanks!

247
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,970
She is really... Hold on.

248
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,150
I'm gonna actually try turning up the...

249
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,070
I have the volume low, that's why.

250
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,230
Maybe like that.

251
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,210
That should be better.

252
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,290
Apply.

253
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,350
I love the Chilby Jam.

254
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,270
That should be better, I think.

255
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,010
Let me know if it's still too low though.

256
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,950
So is this just exactly like the original?

257
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,870
Like Spooky is just in a hospital this time.

258
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,990
Welcome to Karamari Hospital.

259
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,450
Oh no, it's way different.

260
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,090
Drinking fountain.

261
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,210
Oh, it's a save!

262
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,810
How?

263
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,350
Like Silent Hill of them.

264
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,750
We can go in there.

265
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,150
We can go in here.

266
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,110
Why is it so foggy?

267
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,850
It really is Silent Hill.

268
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,650
Let's go to the bathroom.

269
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,930
Wow, it's really big.

270
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,830
This is discrimination!

271
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,370
We can only go to the men's bathroom.

272
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,030
Guys?

273
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,430
That doesn't seem so good.

274
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,850
This one is out of order.

275
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,650
Wow, the urinals are pink!

276
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,270
Wow, it's so cute!

277
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,390
Oh my gosh, I didn't know the men's bathroom was so cute.

278
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,270
It's broken.

279
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:52,590
I'm not gonna be like the guy in Silent Hill who sticks his hand down there.

280
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,130
Gosh, what's his name?

281
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:54,730
I can't remember.

282
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,030
That's why I died.

283
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,470
It all happened the day you became world wife.

284
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,130
I wanted to rebrand but YouTube won't let me add the sparkle of Hiroshi Mark.

285
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,690
Why are we rebranding?

286
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,210
But thank you.

287
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,930
Oh James!

288
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,750
I keep wanting to say something else.

289
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,370
Like Jack.

290
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,050
I knew it started with a J.

291
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,330
So this one we can't go in.

292
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,790
It looks like there might be something in there though.

293
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:23,930
You see?

294
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,710
Oh, it's a little bloody.

295
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:27,890
And also pink.

296
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,710
Oh my god, everything is pink.

297
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,470
It's too cute.

298
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,830
I'm a big fan.

299
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,850
James... James...

300
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,970
Stop peeking.

301
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:48,630
If anybody is living outside of the United States, this is like so real.

302
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:54,670
You know how I could literally just peek in to this and see the whole toilet seat?

303
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,730
This is it.

304
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,970
This is real.

305
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,650
This is how like actual... sometimes the holes are even bigger.

306
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,710
This is the horror.

307
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,170
I could be like hey, anybody in there?

308
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,410
It's so awful.

309
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,840
Horrible, horrible, horrible.

310
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,340
Oh this is locked.

311
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,120
So this is already way different.

312
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,740
Oh my goodness.

313
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:25,960
Oh my goodness.

314
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,900
Okay, it's spooky now.

315
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,260
I was gonna say I really like the music.

316
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,660
Is that a safe area perhaps?

317
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,260
The words never forget.

318
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,820
Oh, the woods never forget.

319
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,740
Neither should you.

320
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,730
Broken?

321
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,960
Okay.

322
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,220
Joint pain?

323
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,120
I can't read.

324
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,580
How can anybody see from that tiny TV from all the way over there?

325
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,360
Hello.

326
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,900
Broken.

327
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,660
Broken.

328
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,820
Okay.

329
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,380
Oh.

330
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,300
Dr. Hamada, Oncologist.

331
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,340
The patient has displayed increased depression after being informed of their terminal disease.

332
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,220
Yeah, I would think so.

333
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,380
I prescribed an antidepressant to regulate this, but was later told that I had cancelled the prescription.

334
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,800
I have no memory of cancelling the meds, nor can I find any evidence that my orders were tampered with.

335
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,480
Hall.

336
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,240
Rat room.

337
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,200
Stairs up.

338
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,540
Lots of patient rooms.

339
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,640
Oh, what is this?

340
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,740
Don't bother the doctors.

341
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,580
They've got enough blood on their hands.

342
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,880
Deal with it yourself.

343
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,340
Alright.

344
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:22,320
I can't tell like what is our goal here right now.

345
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,060
You guys know that back rooms game?

346
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,080
Oh, wait.

347
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,100
No, sorry.

348
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,800
That's incorrect.

349
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,340
It's like a...

350
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,560
It's like...

351
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,000
One of many... Which one?

352
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,640
I know, that's why I was like, wait a second.

353
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,780
No, it's like...

354
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,040
It's a... I can't remember the name of it.

355
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,260
It's giving me this vibe though.

356
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,380
Oh, we can go upstairs.

357
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,240
Oh, or downstairs?

358
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,060
Content warning?

359
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,440
It's electronically sealed.

360
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,960
OK, so we gotta come back here.

361
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,720
I can't remember, but it starts here.

362
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:18,640
It starts in a school and then you go to like a library and then you go to...

363
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,960
I think the latest chapter was like...

364
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,640
Then you go to like an underground sewer.

365
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,880
The classrooms!

366
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,540
The classrooms.

368
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,920
The classrooms.

369
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,360
My fiancé is a huge fan and a shy wisp.

370
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,360
His birthday was last week.

371
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,960
Wanted to know if you wish him a happy belated...

372
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,100
Happy belated in honor of Spooky Month.

373
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,500
Of course!

374
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,040
Wait, he didn't say his name though.

375
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,380
I'll just say Hime's fiancé.

376
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,680
Oh, I wasn't there.

377
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,500
Happy birthday to you.

378
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,260
Happy birthday to you.

379
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,700
Happy birthday Hime's fiancé.

380
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,820
Happy birthday to you.

381
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,320
Happy birthday!

382
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,840
Alright, let's go downstairs.

383
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,020
Downstairs.

384
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,500
Definitely a different atmosphere here.

385
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,140
Are we gonna get jumpscared?

386
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,720
Maintenance room?

387
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,660
Broken, broken.

388
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,320
Break room.

389
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,240
If I grab this...

390
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,980
Take the key.

391
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,100
What will happen if I take the key?

392
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,100
Anybody wanna fizz?

393
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,600
Because spooky...

394
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,380
What am I reading?

395
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,160
Nurse Tanaka, report number 404.

396
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,460
It seems we are losing patients due to surgical complications much more often than normal.

397
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,660
What have the doctors been doing?

398
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,200
Half of these procedures seem completely unnecessary.

399
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,360
I know the doctors and surgeons are above me and probably know many things I don't.

400
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,540
But this is getting strange.

401
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,510
Guys, it's getting really spooky right now.

402
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,810
Office key.

403
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,350
I don't think we saw an office.

404
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,650
We saw a maintenance room.

405
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,530
Locked.

406
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,190
All of these were locked too.

407
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:26,910
Yeah, broken.

408
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:27,990
Broken.

409
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,350
Broken.

410
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:30,970
OK?

411
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,150
OK?

412
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,330
Living core, thanks for the gift.

413
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:39,750
Dead.

414
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:47,980
Are you sleeping?

415
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,940
Can I crawl under you?

416
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,620
Wait, the music stopped.

417
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,410
Safe area.

418
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,390
We are fine.

419
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,250
Oops, we nicked an artery.

420
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,430
So, to an office.

421
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,310
There was one key over here that maybe...

422
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,330
Safe room.

423
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,410
Masashi, welcome back.

424
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,070
Angel, thanks for the gifted.

425
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:39,230
I unironically wish that there was an IRL place that was fogged out like Silent Hill 24-7.

426
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,130
I mean, to each their own.

427
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:44,270
Right.

428
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,250
Oh wait, read?

429
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,310
No?

430
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,190
Oh, read.

431
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,310
Dr. Hamada, Oncologist.

432
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:56,610
Seems the other me has been giving him large doses of hallucinogenics.

433
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,150
What?

434
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,690
It's called London.

435
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:05,870
London.

436
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,370
Yeah, just go there.

437
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:22,290
They have worsened the depression and he is now constantly screaming and expressing terror at seemingly random intervals.

438
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,610
I've tried using a dialysis machine to remove some of the drugs, but it seems futile.

439
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,710
Can we go on the computer?

440
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,550
I love this decor.

441
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,190
Very interesting.

442
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:36,950
Broken.

443
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,690
Broken.

444
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,790
Oh my gosh!

445
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,510
A little baby.

446
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,110
It looks just like you guys right before stream.

447
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,570
What's this?

448
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,770
It looks like something goes here.

449
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,510
Broken.

450
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,050
Broken.

451
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,090
Remember, wash your hands.

452
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,170
Work hard and have a nice day.

453
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,750
Wow, this could be my desk someday you guys.

454
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,070
Oh, sorry.

455
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,450
I wonder if I can.

456
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,270
Maintenance key.

457
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,930
Oh, I wonder if I could have chopped that guy up now that I think about it.

458
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,770
Dr. Tochigi.

459
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,250
Hepatologist.

460
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,090
What's hepatologist?

461
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,410
Is that dealing with blood?

462
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,930
I was just informed that the procedure to extract the patient's liver became fatal.

463
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,650
Doctor, my bobble mint is missing its spring.

464
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,290
Liver.

465
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:05,770
Oh.

466
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,150
I don't know why.

467
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,470
Why did we take his liver?

468
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,110
There are no donation requests and he was showing signs of improvement.

469
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,210
Oh my god.

470
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,370
The surgical staff told me I personally demanded the liver be removed for an emergency transplant.

471
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,850
And the worst thing is I found it.

472
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,350
I found his liver.

473
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,130
His entire liver.

474
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,830
Just sitting on my desk.

475
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,070
Well, where is it?

476
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:38,910
Uh oh.

477
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,630
Exit?

478
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,010
Deformity wing.

479
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,730
Electronically sealed.

480
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,590
Do you think we can just leave or is that just giving us false hope?

481
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,750
It looks fake.

482
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,610
The door?

483
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,250
Locked.

484
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,650
Alright, well let's go to the maintenance room.

485
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,290
Bye chill area.

486
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,970
It's been nice knowing you.

487
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,850
Time to go back into the horror basement.

488
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,350
Do you think I can chop that guy?

489
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,630
Here, I'm gonna try it real quick.

490
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,880
It's not killing me.

491
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,740
Dang.

492
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,760
He's tough.

493
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,820
Maintenance right here.

494
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,290
What am I doing this for?

495
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,430
Why am I doing this though?

496
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:15,770
Today is my birthday so I was wondering if I can get a happy birthday from my favorite freaky mint ghost.

497
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,470
I'm also celebrating by going to a Chicago otake meetup and the round one hololive collab.

498
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,310
Oh my gosh Sora Ichi!

499
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,850
That sounds so fun!

500
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,430
Happy birthday!

501
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,090
Happy birthday to you.

502
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,550
Happy birthday to you.

503
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,790
Happy birthday Sora Ichi.

504
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,410
Happy birthday to you.

505
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,550
Ok guys, it's time to be brave.

506
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,470
I'm gonna press it and I'm gonna be scared probably.

507
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,750
I think we need to go.

508
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,350
Why is it red?

509
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:58,950
Why is it red?

510
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,080
Why did we do that?

511
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,080
I think we're stupid.

512
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,100
Broken.

513
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,580
Oh no!

514
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,860
Oh no!

515
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,560
We're in the...oh no.

516
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,420
We're in like the fatal frame part of the...oh my god!

517
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,260
How is this on?

518
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,380
Who's we?

519
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,600
This is a collective effort.

520
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,640
What are you talking about?

521
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,660
Everything I do, you guys do too.

522
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,580
The scoliosis.

523
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,390
That doesn't look very...

524
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,950
What big hands you have.

525
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,210
Is he gonna hug me?

526
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,570
Abandoned hospital is a little too relaxing.

527
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,990
Let's sabotage the power.

528
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,040
If I attack him first...

529
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:11,780
Aiya!

530
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,700
Aiya!

531
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,310
Stairs.

532
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,990
Upwards or downwards?

533
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:22,650
Who knows?

534
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,530
If I walk in front of him...

535
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,510
Oh gosh.

536
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,650
I don't think this is a good place to be in.

537
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:38,510
Let's...

538
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,910
Wow, even the decor matches everything.

539
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,790
They're like, what about a tree?

540
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,010
But make it red.

541
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,510
And then a chair that stares at the door.

542
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,450
Isn't that sca...

543
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:54,870
Sit!

544
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,570
I can sit?

545
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,540
What do you guys see when you see this?

546
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,100
This is one of those blot tests.

547
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,880
What do you see?

548
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,580
What do you see?

549
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,930
A bat?

550
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,630
A butterfly?

551
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,650
A fairy?

552
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,110
I see.

553
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,670
A brain?

554
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:25,630
No.

555
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,510
See, you're seeing what you wish you had.

556
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,250
This is a test of your truest desires.

557
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,390
A luchador.

558
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,230
Did you want to be a luchador when you were a kid?

559
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,070
I want to be a wrestler?

560
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,230
I guess so.

561
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:47,870
I didn't save.

562
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,010
Let's...

563
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,490
Go save real quick.

564
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,910
Oh my god.

565
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,710
That guy is so scary.

566
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,010
Is this area bad now too?

567
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,410
What about the safe room?

568
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,490
That had, you know...

569
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,250
The lights on and everything.

570
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,830
Even our happy room.

571
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,070
I wonder if anything changed in the bathroom.

572
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,090
Oh gosh.

573
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,540
Oh, ok.

574
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,300
Nope.

575
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,500
Still pink.

576
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,310
That wasn't on before.

577
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,430
Oh my god.

578
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,410
Wait, I seriously walked right past here and that wasn't on.

579
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,890
Ishmael says keep your head down.

580
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,790
Thanks for keeping me company on my lunch break.

581
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:03,490
It wasn't on though, right?

582
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,730
Back to this spooky area.

583
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,130
Nevermind.

584
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,090
I think...

585
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,520
Why

586
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,520
was he there?

587
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,700
Oh, he's gone.

588
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,960
Oh, he's actually gone.

589
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,720
I don't know if I want to go down this way instead.

590
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,580
Let's just go into some other rooms and...

591
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,200
Oh my god.

592
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,740
I hear him though.

593
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,240
He doesn't walk in the rooms, right?

594
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,920
Why is he down?

595
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,220
Is it because I saved?

596
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh gosh.

597
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,160
This DLC is too spooky you guys.

598
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:45,720
It's broken.

599
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,860
Oh, this is the sitting room.

600
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,220
Ok, let's try it.

601
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,640
Oh, sit.

602
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,020
Uh oh.

603
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:55,900
What's going to happen?

604
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,180
I

605
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,120
can just chill in here.

606
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,580
My vision is getting a little hazy.

607
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,400
My head can do a 360.

608
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,220
Woah, is this mess... I don't think this would mess up the bit, right?

609
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,140
Woah, it's getting a little snowy.

610
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,110
What's going on?

611
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,030
Is this supposed to do anything?

612
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,210
It's kind of relaxing actually.

613
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,230
It's kind of nice.

614
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,170
It's kind of putting me to sleep.

615
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,930
It's kind of great.

616
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,490
Ok, count the pixels.

617
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:09,810
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

618
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,310
Actually, it's not getting any darker.

619
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,840
That's a new development.

620
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,310
Anything else new?

621
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,850
This guy is still outside the door.

622
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,790
It's a really clean bloodline.

623
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,750
What was that?

624
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,050
Should I get up?

625
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,320
What if I turn around?

626
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,000
Are you still there?

627
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,300
You saved, it's fine.

628
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,820
I can't see you if you're all the way up there.

629
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,920
Are you going to do anything, mister?

630
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,640
Are you going to do anything?

631
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,120
Oh, he's showing up more often now.

632
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,020
This is my nice relaxing...oh, he's really close.

633
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,920
Oh, it's getting darker.

634
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,420
Guys, it's getting dark.

635
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,200
No way, the fuzz.

636
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,160
I'm looking

637
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,090
around, but I see nothing.

638
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:39,830
Darkness.

639
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:44,310
Hmm.

640
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,170
Death by JPEG?

641
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,150
Are we about to die?

642
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:51,970
No.

643
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,630
What if I stood up right now?

644
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,590
I can still hear the guy outside the door.

645
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,640
That guy is really throwing off our vibes.

646
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,180
I'm literally falling asleep right now.

647
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,460
Out of body experience?

648
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,270
We made a copy?

649
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,730
Astral projection?

650
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:41,970
Am I a ghost?

651
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:42,730
I can't tell.

652
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,090
It's me.

653
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,510
Damn, I'm hot.

654
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,920
No, these aren't any different.

655
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,120
I don't think anything else changed except this.

656
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,720
So, I guess...

657
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,940
I don't hear that guy.

658
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,760
I think we're ok.

659
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,710
Oh, note.

660
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,450
Dr. Kanagawa Hematologist.

661
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,550
The patient did not recover from the blood loss.

662
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:29,410
I feel like there is a monster inside my head and it's pushing me away while it works on something.

663
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:36,950
I wake up in the patient's room standing over him while an arterial catheter was in the patient.

664
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,610
Letting him just bleed out onto the floor.

665
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:43,730
Oh, so hematologist.

666
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:44,810
What was the other one?

667
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,070
Hepatologist, right?

668
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:48,650
Ah, ok.

669
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,810
Because I was thinking hemoglobin.

670
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,250
I was getting it wrong.

671
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,050
You know, they're similar.

672
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,070
I'm not a doctor.

673
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,370
I don't need to know.

674
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,830
Oh my gosh, but what if I went to a hepatologist and I was like...

675
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:11,450
Excuse me, I need help with my blood.

676
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,530
They're like, I got you.

677
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,970
I think he's right outside the door.

678
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,440
Where else did I need to go?

679
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,960
Oh, this is the bathroom.

680
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,400
Ok, don't go in there.

681
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,020
We could go downstairs.

682
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,700
We could...

683
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,700
Since we made that astral projection, I'm going to save because...

684
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,120
I really don't want to sit in the chair again.

685
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,140
Since it took a second.

686
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,160
There was one door at the very end and then there was downstairs.

687
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,820
So maybe we go downstairs, perhaps.

688
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,540
We'll see where the guy is.

689
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,800
He is down there.

690
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,400
Oh gosh.

691
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,560
Oh gosh.

692
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,620
I don't like it.

693
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,720
Oh, we're on the other side.

694
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,800
We're on the other side.

695
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,480
The morgue.

696
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,080
I'm just gonna...Oh, the morgue is really big.

697
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,220
Oh, the morgue is very big.

698
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,480
Isolation room?

699
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,060
Dang it.

700
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,060
So one place I want to go.

701
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,200
Oops, all morgue.

702
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,640
Oh, this is way scarier than I thought it was going to be.

703
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,800
Oh guys, it's DLC.

704
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,740
After I read this they are all going to lift up, aren't they?

705
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,680
Nurse Tanaka, report number 406.

706
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,720
Something sinister is beating on the wall of my subconscious.

707
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,360
Beating like a war drum, motioning me to march down into hell.

708
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,040
OK, we're fine.

709
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,220
Something is laughing.

710
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,190
I don't like this.

711
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,070
I don't like this.

712
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:38,810
OK, so it's one big room.

713
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:43,970
I got acid?

714
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,350
Metal gear?

715
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:50,910
I don't think there was anything else.

716
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,210
I'm checking.

717
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,150
OK.

718
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:56,390
Alright.

719
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:09,250
OK.

720
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:11,970
What do you mean?

721
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:13,170
Oh, it's this part.

722
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:14,370
What does that mean?

723
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,850
I'm scared.

724
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,430
What do you mean by that?

725
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,310
OK, we only have one door here.

726
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,690
Oh shoot.

727
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:27,390
The medallion.

728
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:28,710
I know where this goes.

729
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:38,970
OK, once I get it I think we're going to have to sprint to the other door.

730
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:40,150
Oh shoot.

731
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,610
Nevermind, the door doesn't open.

732
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:49,810
OK.

733
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:58,990
Hello.

734
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:01,070
Gosh!

735
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:01,430
Oh no.

736
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:06,850
Oh my god, I'm stuck.

737
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:07,630
I'm stuck.

738
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:08,690
Do I have to kill you?

739
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:10,290
I'm dead.

740
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,120
Your soul wanders an endless maze.

741
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,120
No!

742
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,790
Well now I know what's down here.

743
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,450
OK, hopefully this guy is not here.

744
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:44,350
No!

745
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,450
OK, let's give him like one minute.

746
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:51,790
A three, a two.

747
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:58,610
Perfect.

748
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:05,290
Alright, let's go into this room first.

749
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:09,150
I don't know if I have to pick up the notes each time.

750
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,470
Alright, we got some acid.

751
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,270
Oh, OK, OK.

752
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,130
Oh gosh, what do I do with this guy though?

753
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:24,170
Do I just attack him?

754
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:25,610
Do I axe him?

755
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,030
Do I axe him a question?

756
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:28,110
A question?

757
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:34,730
Just run?

758
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:36,610
It wouldn't let me run though.

759
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:43,450
Like I got stuck on...I think I got stuck on a wall.

760
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:44,390
Maybe I didn't though.

761
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,410
Oh my gosh.

762
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,420
You can run past, but you got stuck on a body.

763
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,380
OK.

764
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,100
No, see?

765
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,320
It's not letting me go.

766
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,700
You guys, it's not letting me go.

767
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,720
Oh, I have unlimited stamina here, which is kinda nice.

768
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:17,900
OK.

769
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:20,840
Oh my gosh.

770
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,360
Door!

771
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,370
We made it!

772
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:31,870
We made it.

773
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,110
Yippee!

774
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:39,850
They wouldn't do a jump scare in the stairs, because that's where you could fall and die.

775
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,360
Save time.

776
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,360
Sorry, gonna save scum a little wee bit.

777
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,640
Can you acid the meat wall?

778
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,220
Oh, that's a good...

779
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,020
Oh!

780
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:03,760
Yeah.

781
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:07,940
Recruit?

782
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,080
OK.

783
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,240
Thanks Spooky.

784
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,580
She's so...

785
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,100
She's so optimistic.

786
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,740
It was this one, right?

787
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,320
Yeah.

788
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,040
Medallion!

789
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,540
You think Spooky knows people are legit dying?

790
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,600
Yeah, I think she does, actually.

791
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,820
Let's not do that real quick.

792
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:58,920
Let's...

793
00:49:59,340 --> 00:49:59,960
Wait a second.

794
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,580
Since all these doors are... I'm assuming all these doors are open?

795
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,260
Like... Well, this one was locked.

796
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,260
This one was fake.

797
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,020
But this one was...

798
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,320
Yeah.

799
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,880
We are in here now.

800
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,820
But what is here?

801
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,900
We are in area.

802
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,100
We are...

803
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,520
Oh, I hear him again.

804
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,500
Broken.

805
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,680
Are we just on the other side?

806
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:43,360
Maybe?

807
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:43,880
I wonder.

808
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,540
Is the fog getting thicker?

809
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,580
It might be.

810
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,960
I want to try putting the acid on that monster thing and see if it works.

811
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,560
I think it's a loop.

812
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,120
Quite possibly.

813
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,680
You're correct.

814
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,740
It might be that we've done everything we can right now.

815
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,040
Acid!

816
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:14,400
Oh!

817
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,460
It did work!

818
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,400
So now...

819
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,400
Besides that one room...

820
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,780
That...

821
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,400
Yeah, we got a shortcut.

822
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,400
Besides the one room that seemed pretty evil...

823
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,640
And that, like, as soon as I walk in, it seems pretty evil.

824
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,340
I think...

825
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,900
I think we're good to continue.

826
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,720
I think.

827
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,600
Am I hearing more TVs?

828
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:01,980
I feel like...

829
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:04,860
Alright.

830
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,060
Let's go back.

831
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,300
Let's go into...

832
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,740
Let's go into the secret tunnel!

833
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,100
I'm so scared you guys.

834
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,660
I feel like I'm not talking much because I'm just so scared.

835
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:31,740
I'm scared.

836
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:41,990
What's that?

837
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,110
That's not a noise that I really like.

838
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:53,530
Oh my god.

839
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:54,890
Oh my god.

840
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:55,710
Oh no.

841
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:56,630
Oh my god.

842
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,810
There's just body... There's just little parts.

843
00:52:59,130 --> 00:52:59,850
Little pieces.

844
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:01,010
Oh my god.

845
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:03,730
This sounds very...

846
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,010
Like PT.

847
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:09,030
Oh gosh.

848
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:11,150
Free organs!

849
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:11,670
Yippee!

850
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:12,970
Oh what's that?

851
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:13,690
Oh my gosh.

852
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,590
Who needs a new pair of lungs?

853
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,490
And what about this?

854
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:21,370
Oh this one is wriggling.

855
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:23,790
This one is fresh everybody!

856
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,570
Oh I really don't like this at all.

857
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,630
Guys, I really don't like this.

858
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,010
Oh my gosh.

859
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:34,950
I really don't like this.

860
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,190
I want this to end so bad right now.

861
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:38,830
Oh gosh.

862
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:40,170
Oh stinky.

863
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,160
I want this to end so bad right now.

864
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,500
I'm so scared.

865
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:48,880
Touch?

866
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:00,700
Ok hold on.

867
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,260
This seems a little bit big.

868
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,620
I wonder if you think these are a loop.

869
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,470
Oh baby!

870
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:14,850
Oh it's a baby!

871
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:18,430
Ok.

872
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,730
I guess we better touch it.

873
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,310
It feels cold.

874
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,210
What is it though?

875
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,610
I feel like I haven't learned anything.

876
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:37,230
You know?

877
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:45,890
I feel like I'm supposed to be learning stuff about what's going on in this jumpscare mansion everything and...

878
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:48,690
learning about lore and why this is all happening.

879
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:53,010
Place Sunshine Academy.

880
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:57,170
Here at Sunshine Academy, love is in the air.

881
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:04,610
You have transferred from your high school in the States and cannot wait to take your new classes here at school.

882
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:09,770
Who knows, maybe your true dreams will come to fruition within these red halls.

883
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,650
Your mother has packed you a lunch.

884
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,090
Day 1.

885
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,210
Oh ok, that's part of the game.

886
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,710
I thought somebody was behind me.

887
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,040
Oh god, Shine!

888
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:36,760
Hello there, you must be the new transfer student from America.

889
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,560
How do you like it here so far?

890
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,380
It's ok, I guess.

891
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,100
Oh my gosh.

892
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,640
There's a lot of cute girls here.

893
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,500
I miss my home.

894
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,940
Yeah, she's very cute.

895
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,060
I'll say there's a lot of cute girls here.

896
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,660
Oh please, well don't worry, it's sure to get better.

897
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,000
We have the illusion of choice everybody.

898
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,040
Oh her name is...

899
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,720
Oh by the way, my name is Ume.

900
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,460
Ume.

901
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,420
I can't read this font at all.

902
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:20,680
What?

903
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:21,520
Ito?

904
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,400
Ume Ito?

905
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:25,680
School bell.

906
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:37,810
Oh that's the bell.

907
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:39,330
I gotta talk to you later.

908
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,550
Oh hi, have you started liking this school yet?

909
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,050
A horror game and a dating sim?

910
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,690
It'll never work.

911
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:50,690
What do you mean?

912
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:53,890
I wanted to see the rest.

913
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,390
Class was interesting.

914
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:58,570
This place is starting to grow...to grow me.

915
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:00,430
It's starting to grow me!

916
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,230
Glad to hear it.

917
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:08,810
To tell the truth, I had doubts when I first came here too.

918
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:15,950
My dad lost his job and we had to move here and stay with my grandparents.

919
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:19,530
I'm sorry.

920
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:23,670
At least you see...oh that's a sad story.

921
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,670
At least you see your grandparents a lot.

922
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,710
Glad to hear it.

923
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,200
It wasn't all bad.

924
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,600
And after a while I learned how to enjoy myself here.

925
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,100
Well, see you tomorrow.

926
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,160
Day 2.

927
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,880
I don't like the sound it makes.

928
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,740
So how was your second day?

929
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,940
If you're wondering, I turned the volume down quite a bit.

930
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:08,680
So hopefully it's not...if you're just like the BGM got really low, that's why.

931
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,440
Have things gotten better yet?

932
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,680
Everything is disgusting here.

933
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,540
I think it's going to be fun.

934
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,740
What are these options?

935
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,380
Are we...no see...

936
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,420
We should have played it cool from day 1.

937
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,500
Cool and mysterious.

938
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,940
You know, we talked to her.

939
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,600
We can't just ignore her now.

940
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,220
Oh sorry, it's heart, heart, heart.

941
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,980
Let's do heart, heart, heart.

942
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,380
Well, OK.

943
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,560
Anyway, today is a new day and full of new experiences.

944
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,640
Oh she's sad!

945
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,840
You guys!

946
00:58:59,320 --> 00:58:59,720
Elris!

947
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,120
Elris!

948
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,520
The flies are...

949
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,380
Can't fit anymore.

950
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,000
I can't wait.

951
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:11,920
Dot, dot, dot.

952
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,510
I'm a terrible boyfriend.

953
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:24,650
What are you talking about?

954
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,690
We met this girl yesterday!

955
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,990
The flies...

956
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,900
The class was at least interesting today.

957
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,660
I had no idea how many perfect spirals existed in nature.

958
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,980
Uzumaki, Uzumaki, Uzumaki.

959
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,980
You're a perfect flirt!

960
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,560
I thought it was boring.

961
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,600
I've known a lot...You guys, we have to flirt.

962
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,160
Why didn't she respond?

963
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,330
Why didn't she respond?

964
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,830
Oh hey, do you live down this road too?

965
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:19,370
Do you live down this road?

966
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:21,830
No, I'm just...

967
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,170
I do indeed.

968
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:30,390
I'm going to close my eyes and pick whichever one I land on.

969
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,110
Oh, I guess I do.

970
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:39,930
Why does she look so sad though?

971
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:43,130
Well, I live right down there at the second house on the left.

972
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:46,710
Why does she look so sad about that?

973
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:51,590
It's an old house, but it's the place I call home.

974
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:56,490
My home is inside you.

975
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:04,070
Wait, it's like my whole body is trying to peel apart on the inside.

976
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:08,070
Wait, it's two different sentences, but...

977
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:09,610
My

978
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:18,610
home is inside you.

979
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:22,550
Wait, this is like...I just...Wait.

980
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:24,950
He means her heart, right?

981
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:31,170
He means like inside your heart, right?

982
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,800
No response again.

983
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:44,220
She is turning down all my flirting, all my advances.

984
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,780
Oh my god, my girlfriend is a little shy.

985
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,340
Hey, what's the matter?

986
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,580
So slippery, drippy, splashy.

987
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,060
Are you feeling alright?

988
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:06,520
This is day three of Metal Gear Brain rot.

989
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:08,660
What?

990
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,980
So slippery, drippy, splashy.

991
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:17,900
I like how well your skin pulls across your skull.

992
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:18,940
Flirts?

993
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,460
What if this isn't a dream?

994
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:25,560
A fog, a lost memory of a something.

995
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,500
I can't read it.

996
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,500
Guys, everybody should be using this line.

997
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,180
I like how well your skin pulls across your skull.

998
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,260
Flirt!

999
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,440
I'm just going to flirt.

1000
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,820
Don't be like that, baby.

1001
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:41,780
What's wrong?

1002
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,940
All your water is leaking.

1003
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,700
Those eyes shine like a house fire.

1004
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:46,440
Flirt.

1005
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,020
I can still look around the room, I just realized.

1006
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,960
I was so into the game, I completely forgot I was in the BO area.

1007
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,320
Don't be like that, baby.

1008
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:15,650
You are in hell.

1009
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,180
I mean, I did leave heaven.

1010
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,240
I am yours now.

1011
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,500
Our flirting worked, guys!

1012
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,620
I am yours now.

1013
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,520
Are you happy now?

1014
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,840
You wanted me to talk, didn't you?

1015
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:38,120
She's disappearing.

1016
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:38,980
Wait, our meds!

1017
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,140
This is just a dream.

1018
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,440
No, Ume!

1019
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,020
Ume, no!

1020
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,640
You wanted me to talk, didn't you?

1021
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,200
I am yours now.

1022
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:52,520
You are in hell.

1023
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:53,760
I am yours now.

1024
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,000
This is what you wanted?

1025
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,620
You are marked?

1026
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:58,800
I am yours now.

1027
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,400
That place isn't for you.

1028
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,060
You are in hell.

1029
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:04,640
No!

1030
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,900
You guys, stop!

1031
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,800
We have to stop taking our meds!

1032
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,780
Are you happy now?

1033
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:10,820
Now I'm yours.

1034
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,300
You wanted me to talk, didn't you?

1035
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,620
I'll always love you.

1036
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,740
Is this what you wanted?

1037
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,620
Are you happy now?

1038
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,460
Don't you know?

1039
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,480
Now I'm yours.

1040
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,900
Is this what you wanted?

1041
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,500
Don't you know?

1042
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,900
I think she's choking.

1043
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,900
You are in hell.

1044
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:43,640
Sick beat.

1045
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,500
She's turning into a ghost.

1046
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,740
We're into that here.

1047
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:49,920
This is just a dream.

1048
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:50,960
Murderer!

1049
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:53,180
I didn't do that!

1050
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,180
You are marked.

1051
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,120
I am yours now.

1052
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,080
What is wrong?

1053
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:57,360
This place isn't for you.

1054
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,700
How long do I go until it's over?

1055
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,840
Your blood is soaking through your eyes.

1056
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:12,690
OK, get out of here, Ume.

1057
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:15,390
Is this all you are going to talk about?

1058
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:16,890
Don't you know?

1059
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:23,210
Yeah, she's almost gone.

1060
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:27,390
She's quite the yapper, isn't she?

1061
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:29,270
Why?

1062
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:29,690
Oh.

1063
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:31,290
I'll always love you.

1064
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:35,230
This is like one of those Magic 8 Balls.

1065
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:36,490
You ask it a question.

1066
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:41,410
Let's see.

1067
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:43,710
What should we ask?

1068
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:52,710
Ume-chan, will I find love?

1069
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:54,730
You are marked.

1070
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:56,270
Ume-chan.

1071
01:05:58,190 --> 01:05:58,590
Ah...

1072
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,150
Oh, what...

1073
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:02,790
It has to be a yes or no question.

1074
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:05,230
Are you OK?

1075
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:07,510
I am yours now.

1076
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:10,990
It's so...

1077
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:13,450
The sound effect is so small.

1078
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:17,130
Can I get out of this?

1079
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:17,870
I don't even know.

1080
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:20,070
I feel like I have to go until the end.

1081
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,350
Just kind of like with the chair.

1082
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:26,390
I can barely hear it.

1083
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:27,970
She's almost gone.

1084
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:30,470
Do you really think this is real?

1085
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:34,850
Sometimes she says something a little bit different.

1086
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:36,930
So I'm trying not to rush through it too fast.

1087
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,150
I can't even see her anymore.

1088
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,100
Do you really think this is real?

1089
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:48,120
What is wrong?

1090
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,560
This is just a dream?

1091
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:51,400
Now I'm yours.

1092
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,320
Oh my god, no.

1093
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:53,200
Please, no more choke.

1094
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,120
It takes so long.

1095
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,700
I can still hear it.

1096
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,180
Can you guys...

1097
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:01,880
I don't know.

1098
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:02,620
Do you guys hear it?

1099
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,340
This is just a dream.

1100
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,060
Please, no more choke.

1101
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,140
Why?

1102
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:12,880
What is wrong?

1103
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:13,780
Murderer.

1104
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:14,600
You are in hell.

1105
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,540
I can still barely, barely hear it.

1106
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,900
Now I can't hear it anymore.

1107
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:28,860
Oh my god, the choke.

1108
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:34,150
What do I do?

1109
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,180
It's like actually gone.

1110
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,520
You can hear it?

1111
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,220
I'm scared to look around.

1112
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,380
Yeah, very faint.

1113
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:03,100
Really.

1114
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,560
I'm going to look around.

1115
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:08,200
Oh god.

1116
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:24,980
I feel like I missed out on something.

1117
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:27,840
Second playthrough.

1118
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:31,800
God,

1119
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,660
how annoying she is.

1120
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:44,920
Isabelle, talk to you later.

1121
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,240
I wanted to see the rest.

1122
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,220
What does that mean?

1123
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,680
Class was interesting.

1124
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:57,880
Glad to hear it.

1125
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,480
I feel like I know you.

1126
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,520
I've had this feeling we've met before.

1127
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:04,260
Oh my gosh, wait, second round is different.

1128
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:07,580
I feel the same way.

1129
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:09,560
Yep, I'm certain.

1130
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,020
We've met somewhere.

1131
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,140
Either in this life or another.

1132
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,680
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

1133
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,500
She remembers, she remembers.

1134
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,380
Day 2.

1135
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,380
How was your second day?

1136
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:23,740
Is everything as you dream about?

1137
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,900
Or as you dreamt about?

1138
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,040
You are as I... Wait, you are as I dream you.

1139
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,360
Nothing seems real.

1140
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,440
I'll see you tomorrow.

1141
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:39,140
I'm not feeling so well.

1142
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,020
Oh no, our girlfriend.

1143
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,440
Austin, welcome to membership.

1144
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,100
Thank you.

1145
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,740
Hey, do you live down this road too?

1146
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,680
No, I'm just following.

1147
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,400
I know you do.

1148
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,500
Yes, the second house on the left.

1149
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,460
Wait, isn't that her house?

1150
01:09:58,980 --> 01:09:59,820
What if I say that?

1151
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:01,620
What?

1152
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,300
What do you mean?

1153
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,240
I want to live inside you.

1154
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:12,450
What's the matter?

1155
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:14,230
I'm scaring her.

1156
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,560
Day 3.

1157
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:23,640
Come on, talk to me.

1158
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,920
How can you be like this?

1159
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,080
What's wrong with you?

1160
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:27,080
Talk to me.

1161
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,280
Talk to me.

1162
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,500
I thought we were having fun.

1163
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,240
Are you sleeping?

1164
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,080
Are you listening?

1165
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:34,460
Can you hear me?

1166
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,800
You are so beautiful, Flirt.

1167
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,220
Now we can be together.

1168
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,140
Talk to me, Goose.

1169
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,360
Do you really think this is real?

1170
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:46,840
Oh no.

1171
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,980
Guys, we are back at this.

1172
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,260
I turned it down a little bit.

1173
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,840
Do you think I can...

1174
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,720
Do you think if I left now, it would be fine?

1175
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,300
Let's see.

1176
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,480
I think I have to...

1177
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,300
Okay.

1178
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,820
Alright, let's try it one more time.

1179
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:29,620
Day 1.

1180
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,140
You must be the new trailhead.

1181
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,400
Gosh Ume, your voice is just grating.

1182
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,600
There are a lot of cute girls here.

1183
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,880
Don't worry, it's sure to get better.

1184
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,760
My name is Ume Ito.

1185
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,480
Okay, talk to you later.

1186
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,420
Alright, let's see.

1187
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,720
Have you started liking school?

1188
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:53,660
I wanted to see the rest.

1189
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,440
What does that mean?

1190
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:55,620
Go back to Europe?

1191
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:56,500
What does that mean?

1192
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,460
Do you want to know how to get the different ending?

1193
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:01,280
It's kind of specific.

1194
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,380
Yeah, actually if you don't mind.

1195
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,460
I sort of feel like I know you.

1196
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:12,120
Do I have to like not be evil and weird?

1197
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,200
Oh, like you wanted to see more of the school.

1198
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:25,660
Do I have to not be a freaky guy?

1199
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,500
Do not follow her home this time.

1200
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,400
Get the default ending a few times.

1201
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:37,540
When the strange dialogues pop up, be creepy to the max.

1202
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,440
You need to decline walking her to the street.

1203
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:45,380
Walking her street on this playthrough.

1204
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,060
Oh, okay.

1205
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:49,940
I don't know.

1206
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:51,520
Yep, I'm certain.

1207
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:52,500
We met somewhere.

1208
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,200
Okay, so we are not walking her home.

1209
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,800
How was your second day?

1210
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,180
Is everything you dreamt about?

1211
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,660
Everything is a dream.

1212
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,320
Hey, would you like to walk to my street with me?

1213
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,740
It's not very far.

1214
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:12,260
No, I'm tired.

1215
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:12,940
There we go.

1216
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,440
Okay, maybe another time then.

1217
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:17,060
I did it!

1218
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:17,460
I did it!

1219
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:17,900
I did it!

1220
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:19,800
Day three.

1221
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,200
It's such a pretty day today.

1222
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:23,460
Don't you think?

1223
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,560
It surely is.

1224
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,160
It's a good day to be alive.

1225
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,480
It's strange.

1226
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,080
Okay, so now do I be a freak?

1227
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:39,420
Wait, on your third playthrough you can't walk with her and then the next playthrough you go full freak phantom.

1228
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,740
Oh, not until loop four.

1229
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,020
Okay, so I act normal.

1230
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,560
I just feel like today will be a good day.

1231
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:49,640
The flies.

1232
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:50,300
Oh no.

1233
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:51,660
I can't wait.

1234
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:53,300
Yes, I will.

1235
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:55,840
Alright, talk to you after class.

1236
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:56,760
Alright, we are normal.

1237
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:57,320
We are normal.

1238
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,820
Class is kind of strange today.

1239
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:04,160
The teacher seems really focused on germs and gas pressure.

1240
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,100
How have you been?

1241
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,800
Are you still feeling tired?

1242
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,680
I feel incomplete.

1243
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,000
I feel longing.

1244
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,740
I feel worms in my skin.

1245
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,120
I can never escape the worms, man.

1246
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,740
First Eternal Darkness.

1247
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:20,180
Now this game.

1248
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,520
Everything is worms.

1249
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,040
Real Higurashi moment.

1250
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:28,260
I feel longing.

1251
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,860
Oh well, I'll see you tomorrow.

1252
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:33,760
I'm not feeling well.

1253
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:35,980
Day four.

1254
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,200
Oh no, she's not normal.

1255
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,520
Hey, are you feeling alright?

1256
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,640
What if this isn't a dream?

1257
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,740
What's wrong?

1258
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,760
Don't...I'm being a freak!

1259
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:57,540
Your eyes!

1260
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:03,740
OK Alright guys, I think we can...

1261
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,100
I'm seeing if she says anything different.

1262
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,000
OK, now I'm a freak, right?

1263
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,080
I think you picked the wrong option.

1264
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,840
Wait, I didn't mean to let the freak take over.

1265
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,360
Oh no!

1266
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,480
Wait, how was I supposed to know?

1267
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:27,160
All of them were freaky!

1268
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,020
All of them were freaky.

1269
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:30,900
Oh I did it right?

1270
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,140
OK.

1271
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,220
Thank you guys.

1272
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,080
Alright, last time we play.

1273
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,180
Day one.

1274
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:41,580
Alright, now I'm a full freak.

1275
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,820
I'm a new kid.

1276
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:51,820
Slipping.

1277
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:52,940
Dripping.

1278
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,620
Don't worry, it's going to get better.

1279
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:57,980
Liar?

1280
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,760
Instead of the school bell it says liar.

1281
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,160
That's the bell.

1282
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:03,960
I gotta go.

1283
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,660
How do you start liking the school?

1284
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,260
My eyes are dissolving.

1285
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:13,380
Glad to hear it.

1286
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,580
I just kept dying over and over.

1287
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,400
I will consume you.

1288
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,200
It wasn't all bad.

1289
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,560
After a while I learned how to enjoy myself here.

1290
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:28,240
See you tomorrow.

1291
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:28,720
OK.

1292
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,700
Day two.

1293
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:34,020
How was your second day?

1294
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,220
Have things gotten better yet?

1295
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,280
Everything is disgusting here.

1296
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,800
Well, OK.

1297
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,720
Anyway, today is a new day.

1298
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,200
Full of new experiences.

1299
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,840
The flies can't fit anymore.

1300
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:48,420
What does that mean?

1301
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,200
Death bell?

1302
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,840
Oh no.

1303
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,020
Oh gosh.

1304
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:00,560
Scariest stories.

1305
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,020
Try not to be scared.

1306
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,440
I was at school and the bell rung.

1307
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:08,400
But what I didn't realize was...

1308
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,340
It was the death bell.

1309
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,780
Class was at least interesting today.

1310
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:19,120
I had no idea how many perfect spirals existed in nature.

1311
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,200
I've no... Wait, what do I do here?

1312
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,600
Which one is the most freaky?

1313
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,300
Maybe it's the flirting.

1314
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:34,930
The flirt?

1315
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,130
I feel like it's the flirt or the last one.

1316
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:43,250
I can't tell.

1317
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,230
Flirting is pretty weird.

1318
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:46,130
True.

1319
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:50,110
Number three.

1320
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:50,510
OK.

1321
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:53,350
I'll see you tomorrow.

1322
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:54,830
Oh, why is she blushing?

1323
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:57,030
I'm not feeling so well.

1324
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,170
Was she like that the whole time or am I crazy?

1325
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:00,270
Oh!

1326
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:04,470
Classmate Ume Ito has reported you for your behavior.

1327
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:08,570
You have been transferred from Sunshine Academy and Ume has escaped.

1328
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:10,090
Game over.

1329
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:13,410
Love failed.

1330
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:14,570
I got an achievement.

1331
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:16,490
Love is over.

1332
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:19,590
Oh my god!

1333
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:20,790
Elris.

1334
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:21,570
Elris.

1335
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:33,490
A game.

1336
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:37,050
Is that it?

1337
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:40,210
Sorry, I got really caught up in that, you guys.

1338
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:46,280
Is there nothing else in here though?

1339
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,280
Oh, no.

1340
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:48,180
Play Sunshine Academy.

1341
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:50,900
OK.

1342
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,100
So we have to watch out for a baby in here.

1343
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:57,960
We can escape from there.

1344
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:00,000
Oh, wait.

1345
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:01,040
This isn't a loop.

1346
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,880
Oh, it's just a little bit maze-y.

1347
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,060
Oh, there is something in there.

1348
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:09,620
Never mind.

1349
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:10,780
How about this way?

1350
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,920
Yeah, Tokimeki Memorial is different.

1351
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:19,580
Shiori Fujisaki, my beloved.

1352
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:21,880
OK.

1353
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:25,020
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1354
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:26,700
I'm gonna get lost in here, actually.

1355
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,320
I'm gonna...huh?

1356
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:46,250
Oh, we made it to the beginning, but...

1357
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:48,490
Uh...

1358
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:52,730
Uh...

1359
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:53,890
It's the matter, baby.

1360
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:55,390
What's the matter, baby?

1361
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:05,670
I think he comes from these parts of the walls, right?

1362
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:08,750
Oh my god.

1363
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:14,170
The shade upon my heart has been exercised.

1364
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:18,230
Such a spectacular evening.

1365
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:20,650
I've never seen a vision as heart-stopping as yourself.

1366
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:22,250
Oh my gosh, Brian.

1367
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:24,710
The Riz.

1368
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:27,790
OK.

1369
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:30,570
So let's try again the same way that I did before.

1370
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:33,650
I went this way.

1371
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:37,290
And this was where the baby was, I think.

1372
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:41,230
Let's run past the baby.

1373
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:43,550
Oh, great.

1374
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:44,970
Love that.

1375
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:49,610
The baby is stuck in the wall, so we can run this way.

1376
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,620
Something is glowing down there.

1377
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,220
Guys, what is that?

1378
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,620
What's glowing down there?

1379
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:12,550
What is it?

1380
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:18,910
I'm just walking.

1381
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:22,790
OK.

1382
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:28,590
I don't think I'm...

1383
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:29,950
I don't think it's getting closer.

1384
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:35,880
OK.

1385
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:38,440
Oh, wait.

1386
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:41,160
I think it is getting closer.

1387
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,420
I actually can't tell.

1388
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,080
It's not a dead pixel.

1389
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,400
It moves.

1390
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,300
It moves.

1391
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,300
No, it's definitely getting bigger.

1392
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,760
It's definitely getting bigger.

1393
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:00,740
It's definitely getting bigger because it's bigger on my OBS.

1394
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:04,660
Undead pixel.

1395
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:07,120
Is it a ghost?

1396
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:09,740
Oh, wait.

1397
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,300
I think it has arms.

1398
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,240
It looks like arms that are outstretched.

1399
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:15,320
Wait a second.

1400
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,580
Maybe I shouldn't be...

1401
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,580
Oh, I think I'm making...

1402
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,220
Don't

1403
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,880
get up before Saturday!

1404
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,780
But it's Friday.

1405
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:51,330
Oh, man.

1406
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:56,430
Oh, man.

1407
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:01,910
So...

1408
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:05,170
In that hallway we don't...

1409
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:08,190
go...

1410
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:09,370
there.

1411
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:13,610
I guess.

1412
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:15,130
I don't know what to do down here.

1413
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:22,880
At least I got the achievement for the...

1414
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:31,320
I zoomed in on my iPad to see and gave myself a heart attack.

1415
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,380
I'm sorry.

1416
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,560
It came zooming as soon as I realized it was coming close to us.

1417
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:45,570
It's a trap.

1418
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:47,270
Oh, this is baby.

1419
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:47,810
That's right.

1420
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:49,470
Alright.

1421
01:23:51,950 --> 01:23:55,070
Okay, so we're just gonna have to not get lost in here.

1422
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:01,330
I thought this was supposed to be way faster.

1423
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:02,690
This DLC.

1424
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:04,950
How much more do I have to go?

1425
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:08,850
Hmm.

1426
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:12,590
To the left.

1427
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:15,050
Take it back now, y'all.

1428
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:17,710
Oh, shoot.

1429
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:18,310
It's the baby.

1430
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:22,210
Oh!

1431
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:23,470
Oh my gosh!

1432
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:25,730
Finally, the isolation ward!

1433
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:30,870
That's why I just couldn't find the tank.

1434
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:31,970
Oh gosh.

1435
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:35,850
Oh!

1436
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:36,350
Oh!

1437
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:39,110
I think we need to get out of here somehow.

1438
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:43,390
I think we need to find our way out.

1439
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:45,050
Oh gosh.

1440
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:45,490
I'm scared.

1441
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:47,890
Ouch!

1442
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:48,190
Ouch!

1443
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:48,330
Ouch!

1444
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:53,020
Oh gosh.

1445
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:53,960
I can't run anymore.

1446
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:57,280
Go!

1447
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:57,480
Go!

1448
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:57,600
Go!

1449
01:24:58,420 --> 01:24:59,260
I made it.

1450
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,300
Holy moly, I made it.

1451
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:05,940
Oh my goodness.

1452
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:08,160
Holy moly.

1453
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,900
Oh, my health recovered too.

1454
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:12,720
Perfect.

1455
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:21,380
Alright, to the isolation ward which was where that guy was.

1456
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,000
Okay.

1457
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:26,980
Wait, where was the isolation ward?

1458
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,560
Oh no, it was in the basement, right?

1459
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:31,160
In the morgue?

1460
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,440
There was the morgue and then there was the isolation.

1461
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:36,920
It was in the basement, I remember.

1462
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:40,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1463
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:42,600
What a thrill.

1464
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,080
I also...

1465
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:56,180
I thought I had to like click on that instead of just walk to it.

1466
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:58,080
You know, kind of like how these doors say open.

1467
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:01,960
Save!

1468
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,600
We did it.

1469
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:08,180
To the basement.

1470
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,420
Oh gosh.

1471
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,860
I wonder what the dollhouse is going to be like in the next DLC.

1472
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:26,120
Okay.

1473
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:27,760
Do you want an honest answer?

1474
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:28,480
Maybe.

1475
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,920
I don't want to rush it either though.

1476
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:39,940
I have fun exploring and stuff too.

1477
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,300
Nurse Tanaka, report number 407.

1478
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:44,520
It wasn't me.

1479
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:45,480
I swear it wasn't.

1480
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:49,380
It may have been my body and my hands, but I know it wasn't me.

1481
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:53,480
Oh, sorry.

1482
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:53,840
Hold on.

1483
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,960
What's this music?

1484
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:03,060
Is it another guy or is it ambiance?

1485
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:03,660
I can't tell.

1486
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:05,340
Locked.

1487
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:12,880
Okay.

1488
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:19,240
Like I can't tell if it's another demon or monster roaming the hallways, you know.

1489
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,180
That's a lot of blood.

1490
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,980
Nurse Tanaka, number 408.

1491
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,860
I found out how to stop them.

1492
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:31,780
You can see... Oh, you see they are in my head and can control me for a time.

1493
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:32,820
Good night, Mint.

1494
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:34,740
I'll catch the rest in the VOD.

1495
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:36,140
Good night, Cryo-sai!

1496
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,140
Thanks for hanging out.

1497
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:44,880
But if I keep using the radiology machine to douse my head with radiation, they go away for a while.

1498
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,120
Radiation machine.

1499
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,520
What happened in here?

1500
01:27:58,120 --> 01:27:59,260
Nothing good.

1501
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:03,180
Everybody's got the same scoliosis problem.

1502
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:07,900
Wait.

1503
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:12,160
Which way did I come from?

1504
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:13,520
This way?

1505
01:28:19,610 --> 01:28:21,070
What's wrong with this room?

1506
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:22,170
Why did the music stop?

1507
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,210
OK, this room is special.

1508
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:34,110
Wait, I'm getting lost, you guys.

1509
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:34,670
Oh gosh.

1510
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:38,450
OK, I think I'm going this way.

1511
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:41,430
Oh, a note.

1512
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:42,990
No!

1513
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:44,050
I went the wrong way!

1514
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:44,650
Oh my god.

1515
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:45,810
Wait.

1516
01:28:47,050 --> 01:28:48,970
I went the wrong way!

1517
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:56,910
It was litera...

1518
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:57,110
Oh.

1519
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:01,170
It was just a single door.

1520
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:05,050
Oh, is this a maze?

1521
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:06,870
No!

1522
01:29:10,610 --> 01:29:13,170
Read the first letters?

1523
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:18,600
OK.

1524
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,580
Spooky maze.

1525
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:23,080
This is so...It feels very...

1526
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:26,440
Like now it feels very Silent Hill 3.

1527
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:30,380
Oh shit!

1528
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:34,520
No!

1529
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:37,640
Not the eyeball monster.

1530
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:47,320
Oh gosh.

1531
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:51,360
Is this a dead end?

1532
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:51,620
No.

1533
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,340
This is a dead end.

1534
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:54,700
Shoot.

1535
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,220
Oh, a door!

1536
01:29:59,260 --> 01:29:59,940
We did it.

1537
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:03,240
Thank goodness.

1538
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:04,420
It's a new place.

1539
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:06,800
Oh, we got the exit key!

1540
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:08,640
This place should be shut down.

1541
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:11,100
You should go now is what this achievement is called.

1542
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:12,720
It's broken.

1543
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:16,020
What's this?

1544
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,440
I'm so sorry my little angel.

1545
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:26,480
I tried hating the man that took you from us, but in the end the only person I can hate is myself.

1546
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,140
You always like to scare people, especially when they didn't understand something.

1547
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,500
I was confounded.

1548
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:33,420
No one understood your costume.

1549
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:36,320
But I guess people don't read Poe anymore.

1550
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:39,220
Even with the new Price film.

1551
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,580
That man clearly overreacted to your fireworks.

1552
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:47,580
But we can only blame a PTSD sufferer so much.

1553
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:56,190
So she goes to the glass?

1554
01:30:57,530 --> 01:30:59,930
I've been here so long, I've forgotten so much.

1555
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:02,690
Wait, what's in there?

1556
01:31:04,090 --> 01:31:05,290
There's someone in there.

1557
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:10,680
This place needs to be shut down.

1558
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:11,420
She's saying that.

1559
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:21,640
I'll do my best.

1560
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:24,540
I'll do my best to shut it down.

1561
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:28,700
Exit was...

1562
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:30,760
By the save.

1563
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:45,150
I hear that.

1564
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:49,010
There's definitely something here.

1565
01:31:49,790 --> 01:31:54,370
There's definitely a monster, I think, making that music box noise.

1566
01:31:57,990 --> 01:32:00,330
I think it was the end of...

1567
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:02,750
Yeah, the maze is gone.

1568
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:03,650
Thank goodness, right?

1569
01:32:06,650 --> 01:32:09,570
Okay, so it was the end of this hallway.

1570
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:12,170
I think.

1571
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:15,670
Yeah!

1572
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:18,650
I think the...

1573
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:22,430
I think the smoke has definitely gotten worse.

1574
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:24,530
We made it!

1575
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:28,090
Spooky, I did it!

1576
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:33,690
Why are you so quiet?

1577
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:39,470
Yeah!

1578
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,720
Her voice is so quiet.

1579
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:55,590
I can't run anymore.

1580
01:32:58,110 --> 01:32:58,950
That's it.

1581
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:00,550
You win!

1582
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:08,740
Was that the calamari hospital?

1583
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:14,290
Yeah!

1584
01:33:33,450 --> 01:33:35,090
Alright guys.

1585
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:37,250
New game.

1586
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:39,250
Spooky's Dollhouse.

1587
01:33:39,710 --> 01:33:41,150
Let's go!

1588
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:45,090
Let's just go right into it, baby.

1589
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:50,230
I wonder if it's going to be similar to this one.

1590
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:55,150
It was just kind of like more exploration than going through...

1591
01:33:57,050 --> 01:33:58,470
the hallways, you know?

1592
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:09,960
The air here is heavy with must and mold.

1593
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,760
Oh wait, you are on Steve's struggle.

1594
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,220
What the hell?

1595
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:14,900
I have a hand.

1596
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,320
Wait, what did it say?

1597
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:19,900
What?

1598
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:23,740
Your spirit has been recorded.

1599
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:25,400
I

1600
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:30,020
didn't get to finish reading it.

1601
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:36,260
The wallpaper is a choice.

1602
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,080
It looks like angry... wait.

1603
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:39,820
Oh those are eyeballs.

1604
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:42,860
I thought it was a mouth.

1605
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:45,500
Oh my gosh, actually it's kind of awesome.

1606
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:52,260
I too wish cats and owls would comfort me when I cry.

1607
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:56,920
You can't heal in this one?

1608
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:57,920
Is that what you guys are saying?

1609
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,460
You picked up a map.

1610
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,200
To use it, look down and interact.

1611
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:07,580
Ok, we are in the...

1612
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:09,640
What the hell is that?

1613
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,680
What about Pies?

1614
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,340
Pies is so...

1615
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:21,620
Today I got to, not cuddle with her, but I got to pet her a lot.

1616
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,920
She's not like a skittish cat where she runs away when you pet her.

1617
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,680
But she's very much like, I want to be pet on my own terms.

1618
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,380
The creator made another game called Lunacid.

1619
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,740
If you want to check it out, it's like a dungeon crawler.

1620
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:35,520
Very good game.

1621
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:36,960
Thank you.

1622
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,940
Congratulations, GL Labs Associate.

1623
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:43,580
You have been volunteered for our Proud Parent Program.

1624
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:47,660
You have been given a doll and your duty is to train the soul entrapped within.

1625
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:54,200
To confine it to the doll, you must keep it in good spirits and give it attention.

1626
01:35:54,720 --> 01:36:03,520
Many of the beta candidates were children when they died and will likely attach themselves to you without problems.

1627
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:07,780
But there may be times when punishment or extraction of spirit energy is necessary.

1628
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:15,280
The energy can feel quite replenishing, but please refrain from abuse as it negatively affects the ghost.

1629
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:23,180
In the event of husk rejection or injury, GL Labs is not responsible under any circumstance.

1630
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:24,520
Is this my doll?

1631
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,200
Something about this doll draws you to it.

1632
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:31,100
Not yet.

1633
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:39,330
But what about this doll?

1634
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,150
I see.

1635
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:44,230
Oops, my bad.

1636
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:47,150
It's locked.

1637
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:49,630
I could tell, but...

1638
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:51,570
Wait, so I can only save once?

1639
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:54,890
That doesn't seem great.

1640
01:36:56,410 --> 01:36:57,310
Doll acquired.

1641
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:58,390
I guess we get the doll.

1642
01:36:58,710 --> 01:36:59,030
Wow!

1643
01:36:59,610 --> 01:37:01,490
Any spirits want this doll?

1644
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:10,100
Why is there a timer?

1645
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,820
Where am I?

1646
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,080
I can't see.

1647
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,240
The doll is in the way.

1648
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,020
What was that?

1649
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,980
Lots of noises happening.

1650
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:40,090
Okay,

1651
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:43,920
any...

1652
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:46,800
Any ghosts?

1653
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:49,200
It's locked, okay.

1654
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,640
Any ghosts wanting a doll to inhabit?

1655
01:37:54,820 --> 01:38:00,020
I'm not really quite sure what this entails, I'll be honest.

1656
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,200
I'm a little confused.

1657
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,760
Can you rotate and crop so the doll has your head?

1658
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:08,540
No!

1659
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,240
That's weird.

1660
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:15,320
Everything here is a choice.

1661
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:19,620
Oh, so we're in this long hallway.

1662
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:22,760
I think we're about to go into a mystery room.

1663
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:27,080
Okay.

1664
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:33,050
There's a ghost on screen right now!

1665
01:38:35,550 --> 01:38:37,070
Oh, protect the doll.

1666
01:38:39,690 --> 01:38:41,710
Geolab ID 1863.

1667
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:43,010
Log 23.

1668
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:46,730
We've made progress, but none of it has been ideal.

1669
01:38:47,150 --> 01:38:51,710
You guys hear the footsteps?

1670
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:53,290
Norco!

1671
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:54,130
Welcome to the membership!

1672
01:38:54,230 --> 01:38:54,650
Thank you!

1673
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:59,650
We developed a system to summon and contain these spirits.

1674
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:02,030
However, we've yet to find a suitable container.

1675
01:39:02,030 --> 01:39:07,570
When the director first summoned his daughter back from the dead, we were astonished, but she didn't stay here long.

1676
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:13,150
Without something proper to tether the spirits back to the earth, they simply fade away.

1677
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:17,770
We tried simple jars.

1678
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:27,510
See, guys?

1679
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:29,850
Jars don't work for ghosts.

1680
01:39:29,850 --> 01:39:30,970
See?

1681
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:37,850
We tried simple jars, vases, and the like at first, but...

1682
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:41,550
Sorry.

1683
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:44,270
These containers limited the functions of the spirits.

1684
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:52,330
We've had minor success using humanoid vessels, but the spirits are still tied to the physical damage of the containers and are thus too fragile.

1685
01:39:55,450 --> 01:39:56,050
Okay.

1686
01:39:56,710 --> 01:39:57,530
Oh, gosh.

1687
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:58,850
My hand scared me.

1688
01:40:04,230 --> 01:40:05,310
Little doll.

1689
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:07,690
What do you think of that?

1690
01:40:08,570 --> 01:40:09,470
Oh, my gosh.

1691
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:11,230
Croaky.

1692
01:40:13,850 --> 01:40:14,750
What do you like?

1693
01:40:14,830 --> 01:40:15,150
Music?

1694
01:40:17,210 --> 01:40:18,910
It sounds out of tune.

1695
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:22,370
I picked up the West Wing Key.

1696
01:40:23,070 --> 01:40:23,610
Let's go.

1697
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:29,650
Where is that?

1698
01:40:31,090 --> 01:40:34,310
I wish I could tell, but my doll is just...

1699
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:36,630
She literally takes up the whole space.

1700
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:39,030
Are these spaces in the carpet?

1701
01:40:39,710 --> 01:40:40,390
Oh, God.

1702
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:47,150
This one right here looks like a dog.

1703
01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:53,290
You know when people are like muffin or dog?

1704
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:54,930
Muffin or chihuahua?

1705
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:00,240
That's what I see.

1706
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:02,220
Okay, wait.

1707
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:06,600
I don't know where the West Wing is.

1708
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:07,660
We are still exploring.

1709
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:08,380
Oh, God.

1710
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:08,980
Oh, God!

1711
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:11,340
What the hell are you?

1712
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:12,940
Oh, my God.

1713
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:19,180
I'm running away from whatever the hell that was.

1714
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:26,840
Can I put my doll down?

1715
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,080
I can't do anything with her.

1716
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:35,740
What was that?

1717
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,140
What is that?

1718
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:42,140
I was a good girl all day long.

1719
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:45,840
But when dad got home, he was all wrong.

1720
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:49,020
So I hid in my room until he was gone.

1721
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:52,680
And then I shot him in the face at 545.

1722
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,400
His gun was so...

1723
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:55,980
Oh, my gosh.

1724
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:58,120
It's 544 right now for me.

1725
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:00,700
That's insane.

1726
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:04,420
His gun was so shiny, sparkly and neat.

1727
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:08,340
And his face was so mushy, gushy, squishy.

1728
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:12,380
I wanted to shoot more people, but my mom made me sleepy.

1729
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:19,420
Now I'm in this weird house with all these weird white coat people and they won't give me a gun.

1730
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:27,470
What is that sound?

1731
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:33,760
Is she gonna shoot me?

1732
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:35,740
Because it's 545?

1733
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:39,380
Wait, do you think it changes in the note?

1734
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:41,180
Depending on what time it is.

1735
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,020
Look up.

1736
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:44,040
Oh,

1737
01:42:47,490 --> 01:42:47,990
my God.

1738
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:56,430
It's a little freaky.

1739
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:01,600
You don't want the bear?

1740
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:04,800
See, it's 545.

1741
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,440
I guess I could put her back down.

1742
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:10,200
Look at her.

1743
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:12,400
She sits so politely.

1744
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:16,860
It's locked from the other side.

1745
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:20,400
Now I can see what my map is.

1746
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:25,000
Okay, what is S?

1747
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,180
We went to the piano room.

1748
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:31,960
We didn't make it to the garden because of...

1749
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:35,060
Because of the babies.

1750
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:39,640
Oh, save, you think?

1751
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:51,480
I unlocked it.

1752
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:56,440
I don't want to leave my doll for too long.

1753
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:57,640
Okay, hold on.

1754
01:43:57,680 --> 01:43:59,640
I'm trying to get a feel of the place real quick.

1755
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:01,320
So we went down through there.

1756
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:04,340
I wish I could... I'm using my eye.

1757
01:44:04,420 --> 01:44:05,420
I wish I could use my cursor.

1758
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:11,740
Okay, so that goes into the west.

1759
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:16,120
The root cellar is circled for some reason.

1760
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:20,480
Down there was the office, and then we went to the piano room.

1761
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:23,880
Did we go into the clock room?

1762
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:27,620
I don't think so.

1763
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:37,780
I don't know why I need to carry you, but...

1764
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:38,680
Okay, so what was in here?

1765
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:41,800
Never mind.

1766
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:43,260
This is the clicky girl room.

1767
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,540
Okay, so we don't need to go in there.

1768
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:50,240
Okay, this was the clock room.

1769
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,140
Aha!

1770
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:53,300
Yes, we did go.

1771
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,280
It's just... It's locked.

1772
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:57,640
We can't get the...

1773
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:00,660
The... What are the...

1774
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:03,960
The garden sheet or the nail pliers, whatever.

1775
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:09,180
Okay, those are where the babies are.

1776
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:12,220
I want to go see the garden though.

1777
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:14,480
Bull... Wire cutters!

1778
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:15,400
Yeah, bolt cutters.

1779
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:17,320
Can I kill the babies?

1780
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,880
Oh my gosh, it's reading my real time.

1781
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:23,560
I just noticed.

1782
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:25,200
Oh yeah, I guess...

1783
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:29,220
If I had stayed in there with the doll, I wonder if she would have killed me.

1784
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:30,240
She would have shot me.

1785
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:35,140
Little babies!

1786
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:41,860
Yeah, take that!

1787
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:46,270
Take that!

1788
01:45:46,510 --> 01:45:47,590
Oh, they melt.

1789
01:45:50,370 --> 01:45:51,090
Nasty.

1790
01:45:51,450 --> 01:45:52,570
Nasty little creatures.

1791
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:57,370
Okay!

1792
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:00,870
Come on doll.

1793
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:02,890
I protected you.

1794
01:46:05,490 --> 01:46:07,370
It's reading my actual time.

1795
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:08,450
That's so freaky!

1796
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:17,240
Come on!

1797
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:23,540
I killed you.

1798
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:25,460
I unlocked it.

1799
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,500
I don't know what's in here.

1800
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:29,220
Oh, now we have a shortcut.

1801
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:30,400
Nice.

1802
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:33,620
And this is the garden?

1803
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:35,240
This door is wrapped tightly.

1804
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:36,100
Try to open it.

1805
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:37,100
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

1806
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:41,460
I should have known that was going to happen.

1807
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:48,300
I think we need the bolt cutters.

1808
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:52,480
You should try again.

1809
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,040
Hey, get out of here!

1810
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:00,860
Ganging up on me.

1811
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:04,000
Doll, I think we need to go to the west wing.

1812
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,140
Screw these little guys.

1813
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:07,140
I don't care about them.

1814
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:08,960
We are going this way.

1815
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:11,120
The west wing.

1816
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:17,140
Bed?

1817
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,660
Can you guys hear the music okay?

1818
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:23,900
I feel like it's kind of quiet.

1819
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:29,160
Let me know.

1820
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,680
I think you can shake the doll to heal.

1821
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,660
Oh my gosh!

1822
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:39,540
Oh my gosh, shaking it baby!

1823
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:49,860
Let's turn it up to like 50.

1824
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:06,100
Oh god!

1825
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:14,300
Shake, shake, shake your baby!

1826
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:21,110
Remember the note said not to do that.

1827
01:48:21,190 --> 01:48:21,310
What?

1828
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:22,010
Shake my baby?

1829
01:48:25,090 --> 01:48:25,950
Are you sure?

1830
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:32,570
Good spirits, give it attention.

1831
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:34,050
Many of the...

1832
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:36,610
How do you feel?

1833
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:38,650
Please refrain from abuse.

1834
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:41,130
This is abuse!

1835
01:48:42,650 --> 01:48:43,850
Sorry ghost.

1836
01:48:45,490 --> 01:48:46,350
Sorry.

1837
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:48,590
I'm so sorry.

1838
01:48:49,150 --> 01:48:50,770
I'm so sorry little ghost.

1839
01:48:52,510 --> 01:48:53,330
I'm sorry.

1840
01:48:53,690 --> 01:48:54,250
I'm sorry!

1841
01:48:57,570 --> 01:48:58,850
I'm sorry!

1842
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:01,330
I pressed the wrong button.

1843
01:49:05,530 --> 01:49:08,390
Okay, so try not to get hurt.

1844
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:14,630
Oh my gosh, they are everywhere!

1845
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:17,790
Ouch!

1846
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:24,800
Please, I'm just trying to explore!

1847
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:27,440
What the?

1848
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:30,200
GL labs.

1849
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:31,940
Emergency containment door.

1850
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:35,620
Set her down.

1851
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:40,620
They can't come in.

1852
01:49:43,580 --> 01:49:44,960
I'll be back for you.

1853
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:50,360
I don't fit in this.

1854
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,580
I can't stretch or else I break.

1855
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:54,540
They did this to me.

1856
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:07,900
Uh oh.

1857
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:14,340
But if you stretch you break.

1858
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,280
Or husks.

1859
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:19,800
These are all filled with husks.

1860
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:21,900
Doll 3.0.

1861
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:24,000
Husks, husks, husks.

1862
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:29,040
What is it?

1863
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:41,370
Holy moly!

1864
01:50:41,450 --> 01:50:42,050
I think we are okay.

1865
01:50:42,690 --> 01:50:44,010
I don't even know what I picked up.

1866
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:46,830
I kind of want to see it though.

1867
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:49,230
Let's just chill in there.

1868
01:50:52,690 --> 01:50:53,610
Hey baby!

1869
01:50:59,430 --> 01:51:01,050
Oh clock winding key.

1870
01:51:01,170 --> 01:51:01,590
Thank you.

1871
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:03,150
Stupid!

1872
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:08,210
It looks like he's giving me the finger as he walks away.

1873
01:51:08,810 --> 01:51:11,030
Hey, don't be so rude you know.

1874
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:14,090
Yeah, you just flipped me off for real.

1875
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:20,070
It's not my fault that they made you ugly.

1876
01:51:20,690 --> 01:51:23,290
Don't need to be rude about it.

1877
01:51:23,930 --> 01:51:25,890
Oh come on, come on.

1878
01:51:26,630 --> 01:51:28,190
Don't be so rude.

1879
01:51:30,510 --> 01:51:31,770
This guy is camping.

1880
01:51:32,470 --> 01:51:33,630
I can hear him right there.

1881
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:34,810
Happy Spooktober!

1882
01:51:35,030 --> 01:51:35,930
Happy Spooktober!

1883
01:51:35,930 --> 01:51:36,170
Spooktober!

1884
01:51:40,050 --> 01:51:42,650
I knew immediately to just leave.

1885
01:51:46,410 --> 01:51:48,650
So I think we can go.

1886
01:51:50,190 --> 01:51:52,170
I mean you were mocking him.

1887
01:51:52,610 --> 01:51:57,680
Oh there is a hole here.

1888
01:52:01,310 --> 01:52:02,290
What is that?

1889
01:52:03,770 --> 01:52:05,010
What is that sound?

1890
01:52:05,870 --> 01:52:06,710
What's that?

1891
01:52:09,530 --> 01:52:11,110
I don't see anything in there.

1892
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:14,670
It sounds like the guy I locked up though.

1893
01:52:15,030 --> 01:52:15,610
Oh gosh.

1894
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:19,530
There is a hole.

1895
01:52:19,730 --> 01:52:20,350
Reach inside?

1896
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:24,130
Something grasped my hand.

1897
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:27,310
Uh oh.

1898
01:52:27,530 --> 01:52:28,010
Guys?

1899
01:52:33,270 --> 01:52:34,430
Gosh dang it.

1900
01:52:35,650 --> 01:52:37,110
Access card required.

1901
01:52:40,870 --> 01:52:41,930
Oh my god!

1902
01:52:43,170 --> 01:52:47,220
And now this guy is around!

1903
01:52:54,170 --> 01:52:55,310
Okay, I'm so sorry.

1904
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:56,650
I have to shake you a little baby.

1905
01:53:01,630 --> 01:53:04,550
Remember to heal, but my baby will get mad.

1906
01:53:08,010 --> 01:53:09,330
I thought we were fine.

1907
01:53:09,430 --> 01:53:10,750
We locked him in there.

1908
01:53:12,830 --> 01:53:14,310
Gotta get to the tea room.

1909
01:53:15,690 --> 01:53:17,670
Oh yeah, I see it.

1910
01:53:18,990 --> 01:53:21,070
Okay, so that's the root cellar.

1911
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:25,890
The garden has two extra doors that lead to nowhere.

1912
01:53:26,050 --> 01:53:26,830
That's kind of interesting.

1913
01:53:28,410 --> 01:53:30,770
Okay, he's kind of camping.

1914
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:33,430
He kind of like is really scary.

1915
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:34,670
But, oh my gosh.

1916
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:39,070
Nice!

1917
01:53:39,070 --> 01:53:40,350
Nice, we gamed.

1918
01:53:42,790 --> 01:53:43,710
Oh, what's this?

1919
01:53:44,530 --> 01:53:45,530
Let's have some tea!

1920
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:49,150
Let's have some tea!

1921
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:51,470
Let's get to know your doll!

1922
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:54,310
No.

1923
01:53:58,050 --> 01:53:58,950
What are we doing?

1924
01:53:59,890 --> 01:54:00,890
Wait, maybe get up.

1925
01:54:00,970 --> 01:54:01,610
Hold on.

1926
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:02,570
I'm going to read this note.

1927
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:05,630
The tea room for proud parent volunteers.

1928
01:54:05,970 --> 01:54:06,670
Instructions manual.

1929
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:08,170
Okay, maybe we should have read this first.

1930
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:14,170
Can everybody outside please stop interrupting me and my baby's time?

1931
01:54:14,850 --> 01:54:16,450
This is our bonding time.

1932
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:22,670
This room functions to relieve stress and replenish spirit energy in the event that the doll has lost potency.

1933
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:27,390
You may use this function by placing the doll upon the pedestal and sitting across from it.

1934
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:32,890
In the event of husk rejection or injury, GL Labs is not responsible under any circumstance.

1935
01:54:33,290 --> 01:54:34,630
Good luck, proud parent!

1936
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:36,570
Guys, I'm a parent!

1937
01:54:38,170 --> 01:54:39,150
Oh, my bad.

1938
01:54:40,990 --> 01:54:42,350
Are you feeling better, baby?

1939
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:45,830
I think he's feeling better.

1940
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:52,590
We're replenishing the baby.

1941
01:54:54,110 --> 01:54:57,430
Everything is calm and nice, except the guy outside the door.

1942
01:54:57,870 --> 01:54:59,550
He sounds horrible, but you know.

1943
01:55:01,990 --> 01:55:03,930
It's so quiet in here.

1944
01:55:04,710 --> 01:55:07,850
Oh my gosh, it's so relaxing in here.

1945
01:55:13,190 --> 01:55:16,110
Okay, the guy is actually starting to leave, so...

1946
01:55:16,110 --> 01:55:16,710
Good job, baby!

1947
01:55:18,150 --> 01:55:19,070
Wait, is he?

1948
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:21,730
No!

1949
01:55:22,430 --> 01:55:23,990
I need to go that way, please!

1950
01:55:24,090 --> 01:55:25,050
Head over this way!

1951
01:55:26,350 --> 01:55:27,930
Go to the other...

1952
01:55:27,930 --> 01:55:30,210
Go to the other part of the hallway, please!

1953
01:55:33,930 --> 01:55:35,290
I thought he was leaving.

1954
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:43,180
Oh, there he is.

1955
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,620
He's right in front of the door?

1956
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:53,640
I think he's camping.

1957
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:55,760
Oh, my God.

1958
01:55:56,740 --> 01:55:58,500
Is this what Batara does for you?

1959
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:01,800
Oh, shit.

1960
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:02,560
Wrong place.

1961
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:08,770
Actually, that ended up working out.

1962
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:10,570
Nice.

1963
01:56:10,810 --> 01:56:13,270
The west wing is... Oh, hi Spooky!

1964
01:56:16,450 --> 01:56:17,410
Yeah, I'm here!

1965
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:34,320
Nice save.

1966
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:39,820
Okay, so I think I'm going to have to leave her here.

1967
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:43,520
While I go get the thing.

1968
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:45,780
Perhaps.

1969
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:50,360
I don't know if I can hold her and this at the same time.

1970
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:55,680
Oh, uh... Unlocked it.

1971
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:57,880
Oh.

1972
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:00,180
Oh, oh!

1973
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:02,220
Uh... Wait.

1974
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:10,540
Was it... It's not the 5.45 time, right?

1975
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:17,620
Oh, it was!

1976
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:20,520
Picked up the bolt cutters.

1977
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:22,120
Okay, let's go get our baby.

1978
01:57:28,890 --> 01:57:29,570
Hey, baby.

1979
01:57:31,190 --> 01:57:31,670
Okay.

1980
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:35,570
That was over here.

1981
01:57:41,250 --> 01:57:42,290
Use the bolt cutters?

1982
01:57:42,410 --> 01:57:42,810
Yes!

1983
01:57:44,550 --> 01:57:47,610
And welcome to the... Oh, the garden is...

1984
01:57:50,010 --> 01:57:52,010
Not quite what I expected.

1985
01:57:53,670 --> 01:57:55,850
Batara sits with you at the table to recharge.

1986
01:57:55,850 --> 01:57:57,310
Oh, no.

1987
01:57:57,530 --> 01:57:58,970
Batara takes my energy.

1988
01:57:59,110 --> 01:58:00,550
She does not recharge my energy.

1989
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:03,130
Monika.

1990
01:58:03,890 --> 01:58:05,650
1929-1968.

1991
01:58:06,190 --> 01:58:07,530
Beloved by all.

1992
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:10,110
My dear Monika.

1993
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:14,270
Although it was difficult, I respected your wishes and let you rest.

1994
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:15,570
I miss you every day.

1995
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:18,070
I miss you so much.

1996
01:58:19,090 --> 01:58:21,450
I'm still going to try to save our daughter.

1997
01:58:21,930 --> 01:58:24,910
I know it's not what you wanted, but I've already gone too far.

1998
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:26,310
I'm so close.

1999
01:58:26,510 --> 01:58:28,250
I just have to find a way to keep her here.

2000
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:29,390
I love you.

2001
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:40,640
I hear something crawling about.

2002
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:45,260
Something crawling about in here.

2003
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:48,420
Locked.

2004
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:53,040
Let's try this door.

2005
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:56,060
Great hall.

2006
01:58:57,240 --> 01:58:58,580
Oh, my bad.

2007
01:59:04,410 --> 01:59:06,110
Where the heck are we?

2008
01:59:08,890 --> 01:59:10,490
Did the doll's face change?

2009
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:11,670
I don't think so.

2010
01:59:13,290 --> 01:59:14,870
Oh, what is that?

2011
01:59:15,850 --> 01:59:16,490
Oh, sorry.

2012
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:18,830
I'm kind of blocking the doll's face, huh?

2013
01:59:21,090 --> 01:59:22,390
We can put me on.

2014
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:25,190
I'll make myself like right here, maybe.

2015
01:59:27,210 --> 01:59:28,050
There you go.

2016
01:59:28,630 --> 01:59:34,430
Sorry, the game is not like full screen or anything either, but...

2017
01:59:34,430 --> 01:59:35,490
Chill music.

2018
01:59:36,410 --> 01:59:37,110
There you go.

2019
01:59:37,150 --> 01:59:39,170
Now you can see a little bit more, but what the heck is this?

2020
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:49,660
Because I know you guys are probably like dying to see what this doll looks like.

2021
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:55,520
Why do you do that?

2022
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:09,630
Electric barrier.

2023
02:00:12,850 --> 02:00:13,290
Yeah.

2024
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:13,570
Yeah.

2025
02:00:16,870 --> 02:00:18,470
It feels like a set up.

2026
02:00:18,670 --> 02:00:19,110
Cloud?

2027
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:20,010
Wait, what?

2028
02:00:23,590 --> 02:00:25,370
What do you mean by that?

2029
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:35,080
I don't like the looks of those.

2030
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:36,860
Wait, where is this anyway?

2031
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:40,940
Sorry, I keep trying to look at the map, but instead I'm opening the door.

2032
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:43,700
I don't want it to activate.

2033
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:45,860
Oh, we are in this bottom hallway.

2034
02:00:45,860 --> 02:00:49,340
Okay, so there's two rooms down here.

2035
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:54,680
I guess we should try and check them out, I guess.

2036
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:58,860
Is this like a... These look like hiding spots, don't they?

2037
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:02,320
Go to Mint's bedroom.

2038
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:17,360
What was that?

2039
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:19,320
Oh, I think that just fell.

2040
02:01:25,610 --> 02:01:26,690
There's footsteps.

2041
02:01:28,910 --> 02:01:31,230
A doll is a timeless thing.

2042
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:35,210
In shape of a human, but created perfect.

2043
02:01:35,730 --> 02:01:39,610
Immortal and unmoving, yet hollow, devoid of soul.

2044
02:01:40,950 --> 02:01:44,930
A fitting symbol and possibly a usable device for our goals here.

2045
02:01:45,710 --> 02:01:51,490
Soon I will have you back, my dear, but first I must make sure it won't constrict you.

2046
02:01:57,930 --> 02:01:59,270
They're kinda cute.

2047
02:02:01,990 --> 02:02:04,150
Yeah, they're pretty cute, I think.

2048
02:02:04,590 --> 02:02:05,530
The little dolls here.

2049
02:02:06,990 --> 02:02:08,250
Yeah, they're pretty cute.

2050
02:02:10,910 --> 02:02:13,350
Did this thing move or... No, it didn't.

2051
02:02:13,490 --> 02:02:13,670
Okay.

2052
02:02:14,190 --> 02:02:14,950
Next room.

2053
02:02:16,230 --> 02:02:19,090
Oh boy, as soon as I grab that... What is this?

2054
02:02:20,710 --> 02:02:27,650
Oh, there are several broken doll parts and a pair of plastic clasped hands that appear to be holding something.

2055
02:02:28,950 --> 02:02:30,510
They are slightly melted together.

2056
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:31,570
Pick it up.

2057
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:34,270
If I have to.

2058
02:02:35,970 --> 02:02:37,430
Picked up some doll hands.

2059
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:45,050
Yeah.

2060
02:02:51,090 --> 02:02:52,830
I don't know what that was.

2061
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:53,710
Look at this.

2062
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:00,540
What is it holding?

2063
02:03:00,860 --> 02:03:01,480
Wait, okay.

2064
02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:05,880
How would we open these hands up though?

2065
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:06,320
Hmm.

2066
02:03:11,550 --> 02:03:14,310
How would we open these hands up?

2067
02:03:15,270 --> 02:03:17,010
The hands go somewhere, yeah.

2068
02:03:18,490 --> 02:03:20,630
We haven't gone down this way yet.

2069
02:03:21,250 --> 02:03:23,890
I think that's the clown room, if I remember.

2070
02:03:24,650 --> 02:03:25,350
Oh my god.

2071
02:03:26,550 --> 02:03:27,990
Feralit, you scared me.

2072
02:03:28,230 --> 02:03:31,990
I heard... I heard the voice and it sounded like...

2073
02:03:31,990 --> 02:03:35,110
It sounded like... Like a whisper.

2074
02:03:37,050 --> 02:03:37,590
Raiders!

2075
02:03:37,970 --> 02:03:39,230
Oh, thanks for the raid!

2076
02:03:40,590 --> 02:03:41,470
Who raided me?

2077
02:03:41,550 --> 02:03:42,110
I didn't see.

2078
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:42,650
Sorry.

2079
02:03:43,730 --> 02:03:44,450
Oh, Chiyo!

2080
02:03:46,430 --> 02:03:48,210
Chiyo, thanks for the raid!

2081
02:03:49,650 --> 02:03:50,390
Hello everybody.

2082
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:51,510
Welcome back.

2083
02:03:51,910 --> 02:03:52,490
Good morning, master.

2084
02:03:54,290 --> 02:03:56,130
My name is Midfrantum.

2085
02:03:56,410 --> 02:04:00,110
I'm playing the DLC for Spooky Jobscare Mansion.

2086
02:04:02,670 --> 02:04:04,050
And... It's fun!

2087
02:04:04,490 --> 02:04:06,670
This is quite spooky though.

2088
02:04:07,230 --> 02:04:07,830
Quite spooky.

2089
02:04:07,990 --> 02:04:09,290
Oh, we're almost to a furnace.

2090
02:04:11,490 --> 02:04:12,170
Oh my gosh.

2091
02:04:12,230 --> 02:04:13,190
Murphy, thanks for the 20!

2092
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:15,630
Wait, someone else gifted.

2093
02:04:16,650 --> 02:04:17,970
Paperbacks, thanks for the 5!

2094
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:26,860
Caseraptor, thanks for the 5 gifted!

2095
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:28,100
Thank you guys.

2096
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:28,800
Welcome, welcome.

2097
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:29,360
Oh no.

2098
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:33,040
No!

2099
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:33,500
No!

2100
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:34,860
No!

2101
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:38,700
Ok, let's go to the clown room first.

2102
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:41,420
I don't know if I want to deal with this yet.

2103
02:04:41,740 --> 02:04:42,680
Oh, wrong forever.

2104
02:04:42,860 --> 02:04:43,680
Thank you for the 5 gifted.

2105
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:46,460
Wait, what's this one first?

2106
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:53,520
There's just children everywhere.

2107
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:55,300
Little babies and stuff everywhere.

2108
02:05:00,830 --> 02:05:02,750
We can't place anything there.

2109
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:07,950
I don't like the idea of the clown room.

2110
02:05:08,030 --> 02:05:10,450
You think I like the idea of the clown room?

2111
02:05:12,110 --> 02:05:13,850
GL Labs ID 54.

2112
02:05:13,990 --> 02:05:14,730
Log 67.

2113
02:05:15,510 --> 02:05:18,070
I haven't told anyone yet, but I think this place is haunted.

2114
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:23,950
There are like these strange...

2115
02:05:26,030 --> 02:05:27,650
Moaning or woaming?

2116
02:05:29,950 --> 02:05:31,750
Not the strange woaming.

2117
02:05:34,010 --> 02:05:35,670
Oh, they really meant woaming.

2118
02:05:36,250 --> 02:05:37,330
Sounds at all times.

2119
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:40,130
Like a moan, but also like woah, you know?

2120
02:05:40,570 --> 02:05:41,370
So, woaming.

2121
02:05:42,010 --> 02:05:45,450
And there was this painting that I kept staring at, but I think it was changing.

2122
02:05:46,850 --> 02:05:47,870
Is this it?

2123
02:05:49,010 --> 02:05:49,970
The baby?

2124
02:05:49,970 --> 02:05:50,110
Baby?

2125
02:05:55,970 --> 02:05:58,490
I'm also keeping this girl in my sights.

2126
02:05:59,490 --> 02:06:00,510
The woaming.

2127
02:06:01,690 --> 02:06:04,330
So it's like a moan, but a woah.

2128
02:06:08,070 --> 02:06:10,670
Alright, clown room time everybody.

2129
02:06:12,110 --> 02:06:14,210
Oh, get your face paint out.

2130
02:06:14,890 --> 02:06:17,030
Hold on, before I do this...

2131
02:06:20,690 --> 02:06:22,830
Before I do this...

2132
02:06:25,970 --> 02:06:27,310
I would like to go save.

2133
02:06:32,020 --> 02:06:33,600
I would like to save.

2134
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:39,220
Actually, will it let me?

2135
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:39,640
I wonder.

2136
02:06:40,900 --> 02:06:41,300
Okay, good.

2137
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:43,900
Alright.

2138
02:06:47,420 --> 02:06:48,440
Oh, the bolt cutters.

2139
02:06:53,390 --> 02:06:54,550
It's just a clown.

2140
02:06:55,130 --> 02:06:57,050
I'm not really afraid of clowns.

2141
02:06:59,910 --> 02:07:05,050
So, you know, this room will probably be the least scary ever.

2142
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:06,510
Oh god!

2143
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:24,900
Geolabs ID...

2144
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:26,260
1863.

2145
02:07:27,620 --> 02:07:28,480
Yeah, he's just chilling.

2146
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:30,900
Log 34.

2147
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:33,900
To keep the dolls happy we created this party room.

2148
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:36,260
We even summoned a spirit to entertain them.

2149
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:38,740
But this experiment has failed miserably.

2150
02:07:39,300 --> 02:07:40,620
The dolls hate it here.

2151
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:44,060
And seemed totally freaked out around the clown.

2152
02:07:45,260 --> 02:07:47,340
I requested the document on how it was found.

2153
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:49,900
And apparently they tried to summon a happy human ghost.

2154
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:52,200
But instead got something else.

2155
02:07:52,860 --> 02:07:54,020
Oh my doll!

2156
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:54,960
Oh my god!

2157
02:07:55,580 --> 02:07:55,920
No!

2158
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:57,820
She's scared!

2159
02:07:58,320 --> 02:07:59,960
It looks human, it acts human.

2160
02:08:00,060 --> 02:08:02,160
But just to be safe we installed a cage.

2161
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:03,800
What did they summon?

2162
02:08:09,930 --> 02:08:12,490
Oh my god, he's kinda got a booty though.

2163
02:08:12,590 --> 02:08:13,990
Okay doll, I know you're scared.

2164
02:08:14,150 --> 02:08:14,950
We'll get out of here.

2165
02:08:21,340 --> 02:08:22,720
He said it back!

2166
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:25,220
He's laughing!

2167
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:31,520
He's laughing in there!

2168
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:34,020
Oh my god!

2169
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:36,720
Uh...

2170
02:08:37,820 --> 02:08:40,480
Okay, we were going to the furnace area.

2171
02:08:44,580 --> 02:08:45,500
Go back?

2172
02:08:45,620 --> 02:08:46,220
Go back in?

2173
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:54,860
Why were you talking to me?

2174
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:58,240
Oh, it's kinda freaky in there.

2175
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:01,020
Okay.

2176
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:05,400
Okay.

2177
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:05,540
Okay.

2178
02:09:08,420 --> 02:09:10,160
Oh, he's still laughing!

2179
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:14,240
Oh, it's later, okay.

2180
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:16,260
Alright.

2181
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:18,880
Alright doll, be a good doll, okay?

2182
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:20,360
I'll try not to get killed.

2183
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:24,920
What is in here?

2184
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:29,720
A mystery.

2185
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:36,860
I hear like some scuttling.

2186
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:38,960
Oh gosh.

2187
02:09:40,340 --> 02:09:41,460
The furnace should be great.

2188
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:43,120
We can burn everything, you know?

2189
02:09:43,860 --> 02:09:44,660
Here we go!

2190
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:51,630
Open the furnace?

2191
02:09:51,930 --> 02:09:53,030
Oh, my bad.

2192
02:09:53,810 --> 02:09:55,410
I think I'm stupid, you guys.

2193
02:09:57,870 --> 02:09:59,810
Put the plastic doll hands in.

2194
02:09:59,850 --> 02:10:00,270
Oh yeah!

2195
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:03,190
Close the furnace.

2196
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:08,950
Okay.

2197
02:10:10,150 --> 02:10:11,230
Open the furnace.

2198
02:10:11,710 --> 02:10:14,390
The doll hands have melted away revealing a small key.

2199
02:10:18,900 --> 02:10:19,700
Time to go.

2200
02:10:23,420 --> 02:10:24,760
I don't know what was out.

2201
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:26,860
I don't know what was in there.

2202
02:10:28,740 --> 02:10:31,900
I don't know what was in there, but...

2203
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:33,840
We got a key.

2204
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:34,640
Doll, I'm sorry.

2205
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:37,260
Okay.

2206
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:37,380
Okay.

2207
02:10:41,740 --> 02:10:43,440
You think he's still laughing in there?

2208
02:10:44,820 --> 02:10:45,920
Wait, it gave me two keys?

2209
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:56,260
The key might go to the cage?

2210
02:10:57,520 --> 02:10:59,240
No, I was thinking...

2211
02:11:11,680 --> 02:11:12,480
What doll?

2212
02:11:12,660 --> 02:11:13,500
Wait, what are you talking about?

2213
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:36,650
I thought it would electric shock them.

2214
02:11:41,390 --> 02:11:42,450
Thanks, Spooky!

2215
02:11:48,430 --> 02:11:51,310
I was trying to get...I thought it was to the other...

2216
02:11:51,310 --> 02:11:51,830
Okay, hold on.

2217
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:55,910
No.

2218
02:11:57,770 --> 02:11:58,890
No, sir.

2219
02:12:01,430 --> 02:12:02,410
No, sir.

2220
02:12:02,710 --> 02:12:04,270
Wait, she's not closing her eyes anymore.

2221
02:12:05,770 --> 02:12:07,950
His eyes are really mesmerizing.

2222
02:12:12,190 --> 02:12:13,770
I was thinking it was to this.

2223
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:16,890
I hear him laughing!

2224
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:19,930
See?

2225
02:12:20,110 --> 02:12:20,810
I knew it.

2226
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:23,630
I knew it, I knew it.

2227
02:12:23,950 --> 02:12:26,030
Thanks for the super chat, Mike...

2228
02:12:26,030 --> 02:12:26,910
Sorry, hold on.

2229
02:12:27,010 --> 02:12:28,810
You're not Mike Tyson's ass.

2230
02:12:29,090 --> 02:12:30,870
But you're eating it for sure.

2231
02:12:33,010 --> 02:12:35,730
Now we have a weeping angel clown.

2232
02:12:35,830 --> 02:12:36,550
This sucks.

2233
02:12:37,510 --> 02:12:39,070
This sucks, this sucks.

2234
02:12:39,390 --> 02:12:41,850
So all the dolls...

2235
02:12:42,570 --> 02:12:46,750
I didn't realize all the dolls turned into those little piles, but why?

2236
02:12:53,100 --> 02:12:55,680
I was wondering what these were.

2237
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:02,260
What else haven't we done?

2238
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,500
I can't see anything.

2239
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:06,860
I think we've done everything in this area.

2240
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:10,240
Besides, once we get to the root cellar.

2241
02:13:14,290 --> 02:13:15,630
Let's go in here.

2242
02:13:16,230 --> 02:13:17,790
We're in the labs!

2243
02:13:19,390 --> 02:13:21,110
Generic lab labs.

2244
02:13:21,490 --> 02:13:23,670
That's what the GL stands for?

2245
02:13:24,250 --> 02:13:25,590
It's generic lab?

2246
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:27,730
What the hell?

2247
02:13:31,510 --> 02:13:33,310
Just another Thursday.

2248
02:13:35,110 --> 02:13:36,710
This is messed up.

2249
02:13:39,290 --> 02:13:40,050
Doug.

2250
02:13:40,570 --> 02:13:43,970
So Doug was an associate.

2251
02:13:45,330 --> 02:13:47,450
And then they turned him into a video game.

2252
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:51,530
Let's play Doug.

2253
02:14:05,910 --> 02:14:07,110
Good luck.

2254
02:14:08,470 --> 02:14:09,370
I'm Doug.

2255
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:16,880
There's ghosts chasing after me.

2256
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:19,380
What am I supposed to find?

2257
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:24,020
That's a rock.

2258
02:14:25,700 --> 02:14:28,920
Doug, I'm not quite sure what the point...

2259
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:30,240
Am I supposed to shoot the ghosts?

2260
02:14:38,970 --> 02:14:40,530
Get ready man.

2261
02:14:41,410 --> 02:14:42,330
Go Doug!

2262
02:14:43,370 --> 02:14:44,410
I killed it.

2263
02:14:44,470 --> 02:14:44,630
OK.

2264
02:14:45,110 --> 02:14:47,850
I guess you can shoot the ghosts in this game.

2265
02:14:48,370 --> 02:14:49,130
It's kind of fun.

2266
02:14:53,730 --> 02:14:54,250
Down!

2267
02:14:56,820 --> 02:14:58,080
Did it say get ready stinky?

2268
02:15:00,160 --> 02:15:02,660
I just released this ghost, but that's OK.

2269
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:06,720
Yay!

2270
02:15:10,390 --> 02:15:11,650
Get ready victim.

2271
02:15:16,450 --> 02:15:20,170
Sometimes I press down and it goes...

2272
02:15:20,170 --> 02:15:22,450
And instead it goes...

2273
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:26,650
It goes like to the right.

2274
02:15:28,010 --> 02:15:28,550
Oh my gosh.

2275
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:34,540
That was a close one you guys.

2276
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:41,200
What if GL Labs made Yuri instead of Haunted Dolls?

2277
02:15:41,780 --> 02:15:43,720
Missed opportunity reel.

2278
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:49,600
I think these rocks can kill me if I dig into them on accident.

2279
02:15:55,740 --> 02:15:57,880
Alright, come after me.

2280
02:16:00,100 --> 02:16:01,260
Stupid ghost.

2281
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:04,240
No!

2282
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:08,460
Mortis.

2283
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:09,900
Rip in piece.

2284
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:11,640
The memory of Doug.

2285
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:14,280
Sorry Doug.

2286
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:17,960
I failed you.

2287
02:16:21,320 --> 02:16:22,340
Mortis.

2288
02:16:28,540 --> 02:16:29,560
OK.

2289
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:32,340
Based on a true story Doug.

2290
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:34,220
What's in here?

2291
02:16:37,220 --> 02:16:37,720
Oh no.

2292
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:40,620
Is it bad when I'm...

2293
02:16:42,620 --> 02:16:45,640
Is it bad when I'm more afraid of the...

2294
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:52,460
Of the big room than the blood stain?

2295
02:16:53,660 --> 02:16:55,400
Green ghost jumpscare in the bottom right.

2296
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:01,620
GL Labs ID 54 log 809.

2297
02:17:01,800 --> 02:17:05,740
Hopefully now that the doll project is over I'll get transferred back to the surface facility soon.

2298
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:09,280
It's been very interesting, but I generally fear for my life every day.

2299
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:11,620
That's not ideal job security.

2300
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:14,300
Wait, is there more to this?

2301
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:18,580
I don't want to die, please.

2302
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:21,580
OK, I'm just...

2303
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:25,940
Where are we?

2304
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,120
Escape tram.

2305
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:33,440
Oh no.

2306
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:41,700
Actually, I can't see because of my doll.

2307
02:17:43,860 --> 02:17:45,620
Live, laugh, love.

2308
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:51,920
I can't read these.

2309
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:53,840
They're stuck in the table.

2310
02:17:55,880 --> 02:17:56,740
There we go.

2311
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:00,600
GL Labs ID 1863 log 32.

2312
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:07,660
We abandoned the doll idea of tethering the subject to a physical object and instead we sealed her spirit within the mansion itself.

2313
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:10,820
Her abilities within the facility should be incredible.

2314
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:14,100
The director would be pleased with the outcome of his sacrifice.

2315
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:19,660
They sacrificed... Wait, is that the guy who was trying to bring...

2316
02:18:20,820 --> 02:18:23,940
His daughter back and then they sacrificed him?

2317
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:27,540
Why does this look like it can become an electric field?

2318
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:28,500
Did you see this?

2319
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I just noticed.

2320
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:34,660
This looks like it can turn on an electric...

2321
02:18:41,810 --> 02:18:42,990
This looks important.

2322
02:18:43,610 --> 02:18:45,510
Let's go to the non-important one first.

2323
02:18:48,130 --> 02:18:50,470
Are they talking about Spooky?

2324
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:52,390
Probably, right?

2325
02:18:53,710 --> 02:18:54,050
Because...

2326
02:18:54,670 --> 02:18:58,330
She seems young and she's controlling all of this.

2327
02:18:59,830 --> 02:19:01,550
Access card required.

2328
02:19:02,550 --> 02:19:05,050
There was another thing that needed an access card.

2329
02:19:05,690 --> 02:19:08,170
I think it was...

2330
02:19:10,490 --> 02:19:12,510
Oh, this is the escape tram!

2331
02:19:18,930 --> 02:19:20,410
Is it train?

2332
02:19:20,910 --> 02:19:22,770
No, it says tram for sure.

2333
02:19:28,700 --> 02:19:29,740
Oh, come on.

2334
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:30,300
Ok, hold on.

2335
02:19:30,360 --> 02:19:31,280
Actually, yes.

2336
02:19:32,560 --> 02:19:34,040
And then, I look.

2337
02:19:34,500 --> 02:19:35,760
Spirit seal.

2338
02:19:36,540 --> 02:19:38,360
Hell gate source?

2339
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:45,640
Cool.

2340
02:19:47,780 --> 02:19:49,720
There are three doors here.

2341
02:19:55,840 --> 02:20:00,200
Someone farted down there and probably smells bad.

2342
02:20:01,080 --> 02:20:04,960
Ok, we came from this direction, so...

2343
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:06,340
Let's try over here.

2344
02:20:10,540 --> 02:20:11,940
Why did I set you down?

2345
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:17,220
Oh, this is the hell gate source, I think.

2346
02:20:17,780 --> 02:20:19,420
Yeah, it might be scary in there.

2347
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:19,900
Never mind.

2348
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:22,840
Ok.

2349
02:20:29,530 --> 02:20:30,130
Oh, whoops.

2350
02:20:30,270 --> 02:20:30,570
Sorry.

2351
02:20:30,770 --> 02:20:33,490
Guys, I get so turned around sometimes in this game.

2352
02:20:34,030 --> 02:20:35,110
I don't know why.

2353
02:20:35,990 --> 02:20:38,410
Alright, let's go to the spirit seal.

2354
02:20:40,990 --> 02:20:42,890
Whatever that could be...

2355
02:20:47,880 --> 02:20:49,300
Oh, come on!

2356
02:20:51,780 --> 02:20:53,920
Ok, we have to go to the area.

2357
02:20:58,080 --> 02:20:59,800
We have to go to here.

2358
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:04,160
Goodbye my beloved doll.

2359
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:06,440
I'll see you when I come back.

2360
02:21:13,770 --> 02:21:14,930
I'm in the cellar.

2361
02:21:18,030 --> 02:21:19,650
Oh, I'm in the cellar.

2362
02:21:19,650 --> 02:21:21,530
No map of this area.

2363
02:21:24,950 --> 02:21:26,510
Oh, it's really hard to see.

2364
02:21:26,910 --> 02:21:28,190
Oh, it's really foggy.

2365
02:21:28,770 --> 02:21:29,170
What's this?

2366
02:21:29,970 --> 02:21:31,030
It's a black candle.

2367
02:21:31,490 --> 02:21:31,730
Ok.

2368
02:21:34,450 --> 02:21:35,550
Oh, what's this?

2369
02:21:38,010 --> 02:21:39,010
A way out?

2370
02:21:40,790 --> 02:21:41,970
Ok, I'll take that.

2371
02:21:44,010 --> 02:21:45,050
Never mind.

2372
02:21:50,470 --> 02:21:51,490
Oh, come on!

2373
02:21:52,550 --> 02:21:54,650
Need an access card for everything.

2374
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:00,180
Door is broken.

2375
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:05,300
I don't want to get so lost in there.

2376
02:22:06,300 --> 02:22:06,900
My doll!

2377
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:11,440
My doll!

2378
02:22:17,820 --> 02:22:19,560
What do you think that is?

2379
02:22:23,900 --> 02:22:26,660
It's some sort of strange...that's a sculpture?

2380
02:22:27,740 --> 02:22:28,700
Oh, I see it.

2381
02:22:33,390 --> 02:22:37,870
So if the girl is haunting the mansion, she came up with that.

2382
02:22:39,430 --> 02:22:40,750
She's a little freaky.

2383
02:22:46,260 --> 02:22:48,180
It needs a...

2384
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:50,440
It needs a lollipop.

2385
02:22:54,020 --> 02:22:55,900
I can't see anything.

2386
02:22:55,900 --> 02:22:59,640
I don't even know where I came from.

2387
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:00,820
Here?

2388
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:03,700
No...

2389
02:23:06,540 --> 02:23:14,320
Log 187 ID 1210 These spirits get so temperamental.

2390
02:23:17,080 --> 02:23:20,200
We keep having to perform rituals to keep them in check.

2391
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:25,180
When they act out, it's necessary to inflict pressure on the husk inhibited by the spirit.

2392
02:23:25,560 --> 02:23:29,200
Don't forget that these dolls are not real people, but that's...

2393
02:23:30,420 --> 02:23:32,360
But they're real people's spirits.

2394
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:33,720
Is that not the case?

2395
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:39,140
That's like saying I'm not a real person.

2396
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:42,900
I mean, I'm not a person.

2397
02:23:44,140 --> 02:23:45,440
But I'm real.

2398
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:49,500
I think we didn't go this way before.

2399
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:49,980
Oh.

2400
02:23:57,510 --> 02:24:00,470
What a waste of paper.

2401
02:24:01,070 --> 02:24:02,450
ID 1210

2402
02:24:10,580 --> 02:24:12,300
Waste of paper.

2403
02:24:12,680 --> 02:24:13,460
Oh gosh.

2404
02:24:15,320 --> 02:24:16,160
Oh golly.

2405
02:24:16,360 --> 02:24:16,900
What is this?

2406
02:24:18,020 --> 02:24:18,720
That's weird.

2407
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:19,980
Okay.

2408
02:24:19,980 --> 02:24:20,020
Okay.

2409
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:23,960
I came from this way.

2410
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:26,920
I don't like this guys.

2411
02:24:28,940 --> 02:24:30,040
I don't like this.

2412
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:36,500
I don't like this!

2413
02:24:37,940 --> 02:24:39,240
I don't like this!

2414
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:41,460
What are these?

2415
02:24:51,980 --> 02:24:53,440
Another black candle.

2416
02:24:57,410 --> 02:24:57,850
Okay.

2417
02:24:58,770 --> 02:25:01,590
Am I gonna have to find all of these and light them or something?

2418
02:25:01,770 --> 02:25:03,190
Because that would be torturous.

2419
02:25:06,150 --> 02:25:06,590
What?

2420
02:25:11,050 --> 02:25:14,450
A life-sized doll hangs here by severed silver hooks.

2421
02:25:14,810 --> 02:25:15,290
Oh sorry.

2422
02:25:15,570 --> 02:25:17,010
Several silver hooks.

2423
02:25:17,450 --> 02:25:19,390
There is a metal pinwheel piece glued to them.

2424
02:25:19,650 --> 02:25:20,510
The pinwheel!

2425
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:26,030
I don't know how to get out of here.

2426
02:25:35,690 --> 02:25:37,230
I think it was this way.

2427
02:25:38,690 --> 02:25:39,950
I think I see a light.

2428
02:25:42,050 --> 02:25:43,110
Get me out of here.

2429
02:25:45,130 --> 02:25:45,930
Wrong way.

2430
02:25:46,930 --> 02:25:47,650
This way?

2431
02:25:51,390 --> 02:25:52,350
Was it this way?

2432
02:25:54,210 --> 02:25:56,370
I can't remember where that one door was.

2433
02:25:56,810 --> 02:25:57,290
Oh gosh.

2434
02:25:57,390 --> 02:25:57,410
It was this way.

2435
02:25:57,410 --> 02:25:57,770
Oh gosh.

2436
02:25:59,470 --> 02:26:01,030
The lollipop door.

2437
02:26:01,150 --> 02:26:01,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2438
02:26:04,490 --> 02:26:06,850
It was down here.

2439
02:26:11,380 --> 02:26:12,680
Insert the lollipop.

2440
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:14,100
Oh it's different.

2441
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:23,200
Yeah, the map doesn't work so...

2442
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:25,560
Okay.

2443
02:26:27,400 --> 02:26:31,980
It doesn't even look like it will work if we combine it with something.

2444
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:38,380
It looks completely different.

2445
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:43,480
Okay.

2446
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:48,220
You can look at the shape of it guys.

2447
02:26:48,600 --> 02:26:50,500
They even face different directions.

2448
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:53,780
But like, this has like little pokies in the middle of it.

2449
02:26:53,800 --> 02:26:56,040
And this one is like smooth in the middle.

2450
02:26:56,820 --> 02:26:57,800
It's completely different.

2451
02:27:10,050 --> 02:27:11,990
Do I have to go back in there?

2452
02:27:12,410 --> 02:27:13,970
There was also another hallway.

2453
02:27:14,750 --> 02:27:16,910
Sorry, I'm so lost in here.

2454
02:27:18,970 --> 02:27:21,990
I wish I could just turn the brightness, the fog down.

2455
02:27:22,390 --> 02:27:24,030
Just a tiny bit.

2456
02:27:24,770 --> 02:27:25,810
Wait, this way maybe.

2457
02:27:26,790 --> 02:27:27,130
No?

2458
02:27:29,310 --> 02:27:30,870
I'm so lost.

2459
02:27:32,290 --> 02:27:33,190
It won't move.

2460
02:27:33,650 --> 02:27:34,230
Broken.

2461
02:27:38,590 --> 02:27:39,770
Was it this one?

2462
02:27:41,730 --> 02:27:43,590
This is where we came from.

2463
02:27:44,230 --> 02:27:45,250
I'm almost positive.

2464
02:27:47,370 --> 02:27:47,870
Yeah.

2465
02:27:49,030 --> 02:27:52,490
We didn't really look around anywhere else in this room.

2466
02:27:54,030 --> 02:27:56,090
I just kind of booked it.

2467
02:27:56,390 --> 02:27:57,310
I was scared.

2468
02:27:58,270 --> 02:28:00,170
Okay, there is nothing else in here though.

2469
02:28:02,530 --> 02:28:04,410
I think we...

2470
02:28:04,410 --> 02:28:07,030
need to go back to...

2471
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:09,190
where the girl is, maybe.

2472
02:28:10,590 --> 02:28:12,950
This is the access card, yeah.

2473
02:28:14,350 --> 02:28:17,050
This looks like it's taken so much inspo.

2474
02:28:17,150 --> 02:28:21,110
This one, the two DLCs look like they take so much inspo from...

2475
02:28:24,250 --> 02:28:25,890
Okay, this is where the girl is.

2476
02:28:26,190 --> 02:28:27,430
So I want to go in this one.

2477
02:28:27,910 --> 02:28:30,030
But from Silent Hill...

2478
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:37,820
Okay, then what's this door lead to?

2479
02:28:41,160 --> 02:28:43,360
Gosh guys, this is so confusing.

2480
02:28:43,800 --> 02:28:44,960
Okay, we're here.

2481
02:28:51,740 --> 02:28:54,260
This is not the room with the freaky...

2482
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:56,980
No, this is the temperamental ghost.

2483
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:06,040
Let's go back to...

2484
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:08,500
If I can find it.

2485
02:29:09,220 --> 02:29:10,300
Oh here, okay.

2486
02:29:10,980 --> 02:29:12,700
Let's go back to where the ghost...

2487
02:29:12,700 --> 02:29:14,140
I say the ghost, the girl.

2488
02:29:16,820 --> 02:29:17,340
Okay.

2489
02:29:19,460 --> 02:29:22,200
I don't think we really finished walking around in here.

2490
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:24,320
Because I found that and then I ran away.

2491
02:29:25,540 --> 02:29:28,060
This was another box thing, yeah.

2492
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:35,380
Okay.

2493
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:37,460
Oh, maybe I did.

2494
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:50,440
I'll get you down from there, queen.

2495
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:54,380
Her hair is glitching a little bit.

2496
02:29:55,460 --> 02:29:56,340
It's breezy.

2497
02:30:04,740 --> 02:30:06,460
Guys, does anyone know a hint?

2498
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:11,080
Does anyone have any hints to spare?

2499
02:30:12,360 --> 02:30:13,320
I'm so lost.

2500
02:30:13,620 --> 02:30:18,000
It doesn't help that I'm lost last, but I'm also lost in the brain.

2501
02:30:25,480 --> 02:30:27,660
Maybe I haven't been down here.

2502
02:30:32,630 --> 02:30:35,330
There are some spooky sounds coming from here.

2503
02:30:37,950 --> 02:30:40,270
A heavy metal plate over a narrow hole.

2504
02:30:40,410 --> 02:30:41,750
It looks like it can slide shut.

2505
02:30:43,010 --> 02:30:43,570
Okay.

2506
02:30:50,360 --> 02:30:50,920
Metal...

2507
02:30:53,360 --> 02:30:55,440
We got the pinwheel piece.

2508
02:30:56,400 --> 02:30:57,340
Okay, nice.

2509
02:30:57,800 --> 02:31:01,060
So now it looks way more like the...

2510
02:31:01,920 --> 02:31:03,940
Like the actual thing that we need.

2511
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:05,300
But do we need a stick?

2512
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:12,640
Do we need a stick?

2513
02:31:14,300 --> 02:31:15,440
Get me out of here.

2514
02:31:16,620 --> 02:31:17,860
This way.

2515
02:31:23,910 --> 02:31:24,910
No.

2516
02:31:30,890 --> 02:31:33,250
I guess we'll go try anyway.

2517
02:31:35,570 --> 02:31:35,750
Okay.

2518
02:31:40,870 --> 02:31:42,550
We need a stick.

2519
02:31:42,550 --> 02:31:44,910
What other...Besides the candles?

2520
02:31:47,090 --> 02:31:48,570
Besides the candles?

2521
02:31:51,550 --> 02:31:53,710
I'm not quite sure what we can do.

2522
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:11,520
I wish I could save the game.

2523
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:15,120
Is this a lighter?

2524
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:15,260
Lighter?

2525
02:32:19,900 --> 02:32:21,420
The keycard.

2526
02:32:25,670 --> 02:32:26,510
Yeah.

2527
02:32:29,470 --> 02:32:31,450
Black candle.

2528
02:32:32,790 --> 02:32:34,050
There is no note.

2529
02:32:41,140 --> 02:32:42,920
I think it was through here.

2530
02:32:46,180 --> 02:32:50,640
And then...here.

2531
02:32:55,880 --> 02:32:56,760
Okay.

2532
02:32:58,380 --> 02:32:59,260
Okay.

2533
02:33:02,620 --> 02:33:03,380
Okay.

2534
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:08,320
Did we maybe...get out?

2535
02:33:08,580 --> 02:33:10,260
And then I can maybe go save.

2536
02:33:12,220 --> 02:33:13,380
Oh my gosh.

2537
02:33:17,020 --> 02:33:18,300
I think it's the little children.

2538
02:33:18,780 --> 02:33:19,580
The little babies.

2539
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:23,220
Little babies!

2540
02:33:24,140 --> 02:33:25,780
No more little babies please.

2541
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:30,540
Save.

2542
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:30,960
SAVE!

2543
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:37,380
Oh my gosh, we gotta go get my baby.

2544
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:38,800
She's probably so angry.

2545
02:33:40,780 --> 02:33:42,340
Wait, how do I get my baby?

2546
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:45,560
Baby, where...

2547
02:33:46,420 --> 02:33:47,520
Baby, where are you?

2548
02:33:49,640 --> 02:33:51,160
Baby is in the garden.

2549
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:52,180
Okay, we can go this way.

2550
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:55,260
Oh!

2551
02:33:55,990 --> 02:33:59,260
The door is being held shut by little hands.

2552
02:34:05,910 --> 02:34:07,190
Who was holding it?

2553
02:34:10,650 --> 02:34:11,710
My baby!

2554
02:34:13,550 --> 02:34:14,170
Baby?

2555
02:34:14,730 --> 02:34:15,610
Wrong door, baby.

2556
02:34:16,030 --> 02:34:17,090
Baby, you can hear me!

2557
02:34:17,150 --> 02:34:18,190
I'm right here for you!

2558
02:34:19,690 --> 02:34:20,530
What's that?

2559
02:34:22,370 --> 02:34:23,390
My baby!

2560
02:34:24,850 --> 02:34:25,770
What's in here?

2561
02:34:27,690 --> 02:34:29,470
Why are you covering your eyes, baby?

2562
02:34:29,530 --> 02:34:30,070
Are you scared?

2563
02:34:32,690 --> 02:34:33,130
Baby!

2564
02:34:33,130 --> 02:34:34,490
Let's go relax, baby.

2565
02:34:34,570 --> 02:34:35,450
Let's go relax.

2566
02:34:37,670 --> 02:34:38,970
I think she's scared.

2567
02:34:39,430 --> 02:34:42,890
I think we need to go to the tea room.

2568
02:34:45,910 --> 02:34:48,890
I think we need to...Oh, goodness, baby.

2569
02:34:49,350 --> 02:34:51,350
I think we need to go to the tea room and relax.

2570
02:34:51,350 --> 02:34:51,470
Relax.

2571
02:34:54,770 --> 02:34:55,510
Don't worry, baby.

2572
02:34:55,630 --> 02:34:56,590
Oh, no, baby.

2573
02:34:57,030 --> 02:34:57,570
Uh, baby?

2574
02:34:58,670 --> 02:34:59,290
Okay, baby.

2575
02:34:59,390 --> 02:35:03,330
I said don't worry, baby, but actually, worry, baby.

2576
02:35:06,750 --> 02:35:08,030
That's the matter, baby.

2577
02:35:12,450 --> 02:35:15,530
I think if we just bolt past it, maybe we'll be okay.

2578
02:35:22,910 --> 02:35:23,490
Oh, my God.

2579
02:35:25,970 --> 02:35:26,850
We juked!

2580
02:35:32,370 --> 02:35:33,630
Are you better, baby?

2581
02:35:35,690 --> 02:35:38,090
It was red, this little meter.

2582
02:35:38,270 --> 02:35:40,390
Oh, it's going to go back to 100.

2583
02:35:41,450 --> 02:35:43,170
Oh, my baby is so sad.

2584
02:35:43,250 --> 02:35:44,290
My baby was at 0!

2585
02:35:52,010 --> 02:35:54,990
Actually, baby, I might shake you so I can have full HP.

2586
02:35:55,130 --> 02:35:55,490
Is that okay?

2587
02:35:57,730 --> 02:35:59,510
I didn't abandon her.

2588
02:35:59,810 --> 02:36:01,430
I almost died, okay?

2589
02:36:02,670 --> 02:36:07,150
I think I'm more traumatized than...Actually, how did baby get into that other room anyway?

2590
02:36:08,810 --> 02:36:10,690
Did baby go search for me?

2591
02:36:11,870 --> 02:36:16,390
This room would be way more relaxing if we didn't have a horrible slithering in our ear.

2592
02:36:17,790 --> 02:36:18,730
Oh, baby.

2593
02:36:19,070 --> 02:36:20,550
Okay, you're okay though, right?

2594
02:36:20,550 --> 02:36:21,770
Yeah, sit down.

2595
02:36:21,870 --> 02:36:22,710
And I sit down.

2596
02:36:23,710 --> 02:36:24,730
Your meter's at 100.

2597
02:36:25,070 --> 02:36:25,710
Yeah, we're good.

2598
02:36:29,870 --> 02:36:30,610
Alright.

2599
02:36:31,790 --> 02:36:34,110
The root cellar we were able to go into.

2600
02:36:34,630 --> 02:36:36,550
I don't think...

2601
02:36:38,210 --> 02:36:45,870
there were any other rooms in this area that required card keys.

2602
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:48,870
If I...

2603
02:36:49,970 --> 02:36:51,450
remember correctly.

2604
02:36:54,690 --> 02:36:57,690
This is what ASMR sounds like to people who don't like ASMR.

2605
02:36:58,130 --> 02:36:58,370
True.

2606
02:37:06,670 --> 02:37:07,810
Oh, my goodness.

2607
02:37:07,930 --> 02:37:09,290
I was so close.

2608
02:37:09,970 --> 02:37:11,310
Holy moly.

2609
02:37:13,950 --> 02:37:14,690
Okay.

2610
02:37:15,530 --> 02:37:17,410
This baby is not our baby.

2611
02:37:17,830 --> 02:37:18,650
This baby sucks.

2612
02:37:19,290 --> 02:37:20,810
Have we ever tried just leaving?

2613
02:37:21,070 --> 02:37:21,910
Oh, I can't go back.

2614
02:37:21,970 --> 02:37:22,150
Okay.

2615
02:37:25,130 --> 02:37:27,830
Alright, let's go back to the labs.

2616
02:37:30,850 --> 02:37:32,450
Let's go back to the lab.

2617
02:37:32,550 --> 02:37:34,130
There was nothing else, right?

2618
02:37:35,230 --> 02:37:36,450
Uh-oh, my chat disconnected.

2619
02:37:39,870 --> 02:37:40,390
Hmm.

2620
02:37:44,150 --> 02:37:48,950
Oh wait, this area had the clown room.

2621
02:37:50,830 --> 02:37:52,250
We can go to the tram now.

2622
02:37:52,370 --> 02:37:53,910
Yeah, we can go to the tram.

2623
02:37:55,030 --> 02:37:55,790
True, true.

2624
02:37:58,650 --> 02:38:01,230
You guys said to go to the clown room again, right?

2625
02:38:02,310 --> 02:38:02,950
Hmm.

2626
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:06,910
What were in those two bottom rooms?

2627
02:38:07,050 --> 02:38:10,090
Ah, no doors that needed a...

2628
02:38:11,430 --> 02:38:13,530
that needed an access code.

2629
02:38:18,930 --> 02:38:20,130
Maybe we're fine.

2630
02:38:21,290 --> 02:38:21,990
Alright, baby.

2631
02:38:25,730 --> 02:38:27,010
But before...

2632
02:38:27,010 --> 02:38:27,370
Oh.

2633
02:38:28,090 --> 02:38:29,990
I keep going to the wrong one.

2634
02:38:34,020 --> 02:38:35,500
Okay, this is the girl.

2635
02:38:35,780 --> 02:38:37,080
We don't need to be back in here.

2636
02:38:37,240 --> 02:38:38,460
This one needed an access.

2637
02:38:40,860 --> 02:38:41,580
Or no.

2638
02:38:45,740 --> 02:38:47,060
We are... somewhere.

2639
02:38:47,540 --> 02:38:48,920
I can't tell anymore.

2640
02:38:54,300 --> 02:38:55,660
Oh, you saw I skipped.

2641
02:38:55,720 --> 02:38:56,960
Kind of pointless to go back.

2642
02:38:58,560 --> 02:39:03,120
Oh, was I supposed to go back in and he was going to be escaped and be like, woah, scary.

2643
02:39:04,140 --> 02:39:06,820
Wait, where is the room that...

2644
02:39:06,820 --> 02:39:07,600
Huh?

2645
02:39:07,940 --> 02:39:08,960
Am I...

2646
02:39:11,560 --> 02:39:13,580
Where is the room that I fell down into?

2647
02:39:16,020 --> 02:39:17,120
This is the doll.

2648
02:39:17,940 --> 02:39:18,240
Huh?

2649
02:39:22,420 --> 02:39:22,840
What?

2650
02:39:23,180 --> 02:39:23,340
What?

2651
02:39:25,020 --> 02:39:27,320
Oh, wait, it was in here, wasn't it?

2652
02:39:27,380 --> 02:39:28,380
Oh, that's right, that's right.

2653
02:39:28,660 --> 02:39:29,980
It was like this one, I think.

2654
02:39:34,950 --> 02:39:35,670
I think.

2655
02:39:36,110 --> 02:39:37,350
Hold on, let's check this out.

2656
02:39:39,650 --> 02:39:40,150
Beep beep.

2657
02:39:41,550 --> 02:39:43,470
Can we actually just leave?

2658
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,420
Can we like just get out of here?

2659
02:39:54,100 --> 02:39:56,360
This train looks like it goes all the way back to the surface.

2660
02:39:59,810 --> 02:40:01,030
Start the train?

2661
02:40:01,570 --> 02:40:04,930
Not yet, I think.

2662
02:40:08,990 --> 02:40:10,050
You sure?

2663
02:40:11,370 --> 02:40:13,990
I didn't complete in here.

2664
02:40:17,230 --> 02:40:20,430
Ok, this is the area that was wigging me out.

2665
02:40:21,870 --> 02:40:25,510
I couldn't figure out where I was at.

2666
02:40:26,030 --> 02:40:26,930
Ok, ok, ok.

2667
02:40:29,650 --> 02:40:30,030
No!

2668
02:40:31,250 --> 02:40:32,970
Oh, I can't go back.

2669
02:40:33,890 --> 02:40:35,870
What's in those rooms then?

2670
02:40:38,430 --> 02:40:40,670
You already saved, so start it.

2671
02:40:41,330 --> 02:40:42,650
I guess that's true.

2672
02:40:44,810 --> 02:40:47,710
If I set her down here, does it still open up?

2673
02:40:49,870 --> 02:40:50,590
Nope.

2674
02:40:51,590 --> 02:40:52,750
Hmm.

2675
02:40:54,770 --> 02:40:57,730
This was the...

2676
02:40:57,730 --> 02:40:59,350
Hell gate source.

2677
02:40:59,790 --> 02:41:00,690
Exciting!

2678
02:41:01,290 --> 02:41:02,590
Oh my gosh.

2679
02:41:03,270 --> 02:41:03,810
No.

2680
02:41:05,550 --> 02:41:06,590
Are you kidding me?

2681
02:41:06,950 --> 02:41:08,670
No, no!

2682
02:41:09,710 --> 02:41:10,130
No!

2683
02:41:11,550 --> 02:41:12,030
No!

2684
02:41:16,260 --> 02:41:17,700
Kira Genesis.

2685
02:41:18,320 --> 02:41:20,880
Not enough ritual materials in the room.

2686
02:41:22,020 --> 02:41:25,080
You mean this whole thing is run off of a Sega Genesis?

2687
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:32,420
I have to go back and get the candles.

2688
02:41:37,900 --> 02:41:40,560
Baby, I'm so angry baby.

2689
02:41:41,180 --> 02:41:43,660
But I'm not gonna take my anger out on you baby.

2690
02:41:46,300 --> 02:41:47,580
I'm so angry.

2691
02:41:48,360 --> 02:41:49,840
I'm so mad!

2692
02:41:50,920 --> 02:41:51,540
No!

2693
02:41:55,100 --> 02:41:56,180
What was this one?

2694
02:41:56,260 --> 02:41:57,720
Oh, this was the spirit seal.

2695
02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:00,960
Seal chamber.

2696
02:42:19,540 --> 02:42:21,460
The seal can be turned off.

2697
02:42:22,060 --> 02:42:24,740
But if I do this, I'll have to let the dottled spirit go.

2698
02:42:25,060 --> 02:42:26,520
There's no going back after this.

2699
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:27,900
End the nightmare.

2700
02:42:34,440 --> 02:42:35,760
Wait, I can just...

2701
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:36,820
Wait, what does this say first?

2702
02:42:37,960 --> 02:42:39,200
The seal is almost complete.

2703
02:42:39,620 --> 02:42:40,800
And then you can return to me.

2704
02:42:41,060 --> 02:42:44,340
It requires a nightmare to work, so I will surrender mine.

2705
02:42:44,800 --> 02:42:47,620
The same nightmare that took you from us will now bring you back.

2706
02:42:52,960 --> 02:42:55,120
Do I need all the candles before I do this?

2707
02:42:56,020 --> 02:42:56,700
I wonder.

2708
02:42:58,680 --> 02:42:59,560
Oh baby.

2709
02:43:00,360 --> 02:43:02,480
Okay, so we can...

2710
02:43:02,480 --> 02:43:04,080
I did save.

2711
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:08,540
I don't know... Okay, so once I...

2712
02:43:08,540 --> 02:43:14,840
Do I have to go into the hell source room to see the candles before I can go back and pick them up?

2713
02:43:16,100 --> 02:43:18,840
Because if I can just run back and pick them up now...

2714
02:43:18,840 --> 02:43:21,560
Or like, you know, once I die...

2715
02:43:24,500 --> 02:43:27,340
Yeah, we're at an ending crossroad for real.

2716
02:43:32,940 --> 02:43:40,640
I guess we have to go into the basement again.

2717
02:43:48,670 --> 02:43:49,190
Alright.

2718
02:43:58,040 --> 02:43:58,560
Alright.

2719
02:43:59,660 --> 02:44:00,700
Alright guys.

2720
02:44:03,300 --> 02:44:07,720
But I can just end the nightmare and all these little assholes will shut the hell up.

2721
02:44:09,560 --> 02:44:11,040
All of them will shut up.

2722
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:14,640
You got this, Minto?

2723
02:44:14,780 --> 02:44:15,340
Thank you!

2724
02:44:17,360 --> 02:44:17,960
Alright.

2725
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:20,140
I don't like it down there.

2726
02:44:20,660 --> 02:44:24,040
Okay, we know one was where we fell into the place.

2727
02:44:24,920 --> 02:44:29,180
We know one was by the spooky girl's body.

2728
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:35,400
I don't remember where the third... Oh, the third one is...

2729
02:44:35,400 --> 02:44:40,360
In through that door that we unlocked to get the...

2730
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:44,940
To get the keycard.

2731
02:44:46,700 --> 02:44:47,760
We're going in, Mint.

2732
02:44:47,800 --> 02:44:49,260
I feel like we have to.

2733
02:44:53,490 --> 02:44:55,130
I feel like we have to.

2734
02:44:55,590 --> 02:44:56,010
Right?

2735
02:44:57,070 --> 02:44:58,270
To get the good ending?

2736
02:45:03,650 --> 02:45:04,950
We must brace ourselves.

2737
02:45:05,110 --> 02:45:06,990
Is this like, no choo-choo ending?

2738
02:45:09,610 --> 02:45:12,150
Guys, I feel like I'm gonna die so many times.

2739
02:45:12,410 --> 02:45:13,990
Is it really difficult down there?

2740
02:45:14,050 --> 02:45:15,590
If you've played this before, do you know?

2741
02:45:15,590 --> 02:45:18,010
If it's really difficult down there with her?

2742
02:45:24,790 --> 02:45:30,030
So we could take the tram and leave, use the seal and end the nightmare, or play Sonic 3 and Knuckles.

2743
02:45:31,510 --> 02:45:31,950
Decisions.

2744
02:45:36,750 --> 02:45:40,930
If this ends up being the wrong answer, at least we can save to...

2745
02:45:40,930 --> 02:45:42,990
You can save to go back to the right one.

2746
02:45:43,090 --> 02:45:43,370
True.

2747
02:45:48,610 --> 02:45:49,550
It's spooky.

2748
02:45:50,450 --> 02:45:52,510
I could tell you, but that would not be fun.

2749
02:45:52,710 --> 02:45:55,870
Why don't you guys ever... What happened to backseaters?

2750
02:45:58,150 --> 02:46:02,170
Back in my day... Look at them, trailing along the walls.

2751
02:46:03,310 --> 02:46:06,790
Back in my day, backseaters always wanted a backseat.

2752
02:46:08,930 --> 02:46:12,210
Back in my day, backseaters would tell you everything about a game.

2753
02:46:12,670 --> 02:46:14,150
Now they're like, no help.

2754
02:46:14,150 --> 02:46:14,910
Why?

2755
02:46:15,130 --> 02:46:17,870
Even if I ask for a hint, that's not help.

2756
02:46:17,930 --> 02:46:19,110
That's just a hint.

2757
02:46:23,650 --> 02:46:26,550
It's just a little... It's just a...

2758
02:46:27,730 --> 02:46:30,630
It's just a little...

2759
02:46:30,630 --> 02:46:32,150
Oh it's...

2760
02:46:34,910 --> 02:46:35,950
Oh gosh...

2761
02:46:38,710 --> 02:46:41,750
I have to go to the little ghosties room.

2762
02:46:44,330 --> 02:46:47,050
We didn't give help unless you explicitly ask.

2763
02:46:47,270 --> 02:46:48,950
What are you talking about?

2764
02:46:50,990 --> 02:46:53,690
I say, can I please have a hint, please?

2765
02:46:53,750 --> 02:46:55,310
And people say, no help.

2766
02:46:57,130 --> 02:46:59,090
I think that's you not helping.

2767
02:47:02,730 --> 02:47:06,310
Actually, before we go in, I'm going to go to the little ghosties room.

2768
02:47:08,490 --> 02:47:09,010
BRB.

2769
02:47:09,110 --> 02:47:09,690
I'll be fast.

2770
02:47:09,790 --> 02:47:10,290
I'll be fast.

2771
02:47:10,470 --> 02:47:11,470
BRB, BRB.

2772
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:27,920
BRB.

2773
02:49:27,960 --> 02:49:29,180
Did anything spooky happen?

2774
02:49:34,160 --> 02:49:36,540
Chat, do we help Mint use the little ghosties room?

2775
02:49:36,940 --> 02:49:37,620
No.

2776
02:49:38,500 --> 02:49:40,220
I can do that all on my own.

2777
02:49:43,240 --> 02:49:44,380
Nothing spooky.

2778
02:49:47,180 --> 02:49:48,540
Nothing spooky.

2779
02:49:49,300 --> 02:49:49,980
OK.

2780
02:49:50,720 --> 02:49:52,700
Let's do this!

2781
02:49:54,400 --> 02:49:56,280
Put on your game face!

2782
02:49:57,780 --> 02:49:58,300
Alright.

2783
02:49:58,820 --> 02:50:00,200
I know where they are.

2784
02:50:00,320 --> 02:50:01,220
I know where they are.

2785
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:02,960
It's just a matter of getting them.

2786
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:18,800
OK.

2787
02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:21,440
OK.

2788
02:50:21,920 --> 02:50:23,280
Oh gosh.

2789
02:50:24,140 --> 02:50:24,660
Golly.

2790
02:50:24,900 --> 02:50:27,020
It's just a matter of getting there.

2791
02:50:28,100 --> 02:50:30,900
What if we get one, come back, save.

2792
02:50:31,200 --> 02:50:31,720
Get two...

2793
02:50:31,720 --> 02:50:35,040
I can hear her outside the door.

2794
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:42,940
I can hear her out there.

2795
02:50:44,180 --> 02:50:48,600
What if we... What if we get one, come back here, save.

2796
02:50:55,140 --> 02:50:56,320
Oh man.

2797
02:51:06,610 --> 02:51:07,990
Oh, she's scared.

2798
02:51:09,090 --> 02:51:09,630
I am too.

2799
02:51:16,180 --> 02:51:18,340
Oh, she's not scared anymore.

2800
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:21,120
Alright, one candle, get two.

2801
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:23,680
I can get all three probably.

2802
02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:29,900
But I feel safer grabbing one, saving, coming back.

2803
02:51:30,040 --> 02:51:31,540
It's gonna take so long.

2804
02:51:33,640 --> 02:51:35,680
It's gonna take so...Coward!

2805
02:51:37,180 --> 02:51:38,380
Have confidence?

2806
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:39,960
OK.

2807
02:51:39,960 --> 02:51:40,160
OK.

2808
02:51:42,220 --> 02:51:44,540
She doesn't do that much damage, doesn't it?

2809
02:51:44,600 --> 02:51:44,720
OK.

2810
02:51:45,180 --> 02:51:47,860
I just don't know where the other two are.

2811
02:51:47,940 --> 02:51:49,200
You guys, I get lost.

2812
02:51:50,320 --> 02:51:51,440
I get lost.

2813
02:51:51,820 --> 02:51:53,240
That's my biggest issue.

2814
02:51:57,900 --> 02:52:00,220
That one was the easiest one.

2815
02:52:06,420 --> 02:52:07,500
I don't know.

2816
02:52:07,500 --> 02:52:08,480
Just remember the right path.

2817
02:52:08,620 --> 02:52:12,380
I remember once I find the room how to get to the other candle.

2818
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:15,560
Oh gosh.

2819
02:52:23,540 --> 02:52:24,080
OK.

2820
02:52:32,820 --> 02:52:34,760
Hey, that wasn't there before.

2821
02:52:36,500 --> 02:52:38,200
Did I go to the wrong place?

2822
02:52:38,480 --> 02:52:38,700
No.

2823
02:52:39,300 --> 02:52:40,520
Yes, I did.

2824
02:52:41,800 --> 02:52:42,500
Yeah, I did.

2825
02:52:43,420 --> 02:52:44,080
Wait, no.

2826
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:46,180
Wait, yeah.

2827
02:52:46,480 --> 02:52:46,900
Yeah, I did.

2828
02:52:47,180 --> 02:52:47,920
Wait, no.

2829
02:52:48,120 --> 02:52:48,620
Wait, yeah.

2830
02:52:48,720 --> 02:52:49,100
Yeah, I did.

2831
02:52:51,800 --> 02:52:53,440
Refusal to help is a big compliment.

2832
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:55,340
Backstabbing often arises from frustration.

2833
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:56,860
Oh my god, she's scared.

2834
02:52:57,120 --> 02:52:57,580
So am I.

2835
02:52:58,340 --> 02:52:59,460
She's scared and so...

2836
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:00,580
Oh shit.

2837
02:53:00,920 --> 02:53:02,540
I didn't know she'll come through the walls!

2838
02:53:04,720 --> 02:53:06,900
Guys, my stamina...

2839
02:53:25,340 --> 02:53:25,940
Oh my god.

2840
02:53:26,120 --> 02:53:27,240
Dodge and run.

2841
02:53:27,940 --> 02:53:28,880
Oh shit, wrong way.

2842
02:53:34,940 --> 02:53:35,580
Oh my god.

2843
02:53:36,680 --> 02:53:37,480
That's a locked door.

2844
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:38,860
OK, how do I get home?

2845
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:42,020
I went the wrong way.

2846
02:53:44,640 --> 02:53:45,440
I need a break!

2847
02:53:45,980 --> 02:53:46,920
I need a break!

2848
02:53:48,640 --> 02:53:49,740
I need a break!

2849
02:53:49,820 --> 02:53:50,380
I need a break!

2850
02:53:50,440 --> 02:53:51,100
I need a break!

2851
02:53:51,100 --> 02:53:54,040
OK, I just have to find the...

2852
02:53:56,220 --> 02:53:56,900
Shake baby.

2853
02:53:57,420 --> 02:53:59,100
OK, I just need to find the...

2854
02:54:00,960 --> 02:54:02,040
The pinwheel door.

2855
02:54:02,720 --> 02:54:02,860
OK.

2856
02:54:04,240 --> 02:54:04,980
2 out of 3.

2857
02:54:05,740 --> 02:54:06,340
2 out of 3.

2858
02:54:06,460 --> 02:54:06,880
2 out of 3.

2859
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:07,600
OK.

2860
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:11,600
Is it?

2861
02:54:11,780 --> 02:54:12,000
OK.

2862
02:54:12,560 --> 02:54:14,100
When I go in here...

2863
02:54:15,580 --> 02:54:17,520
Am I seeing a model clip through the door?

2864
02:54:17,720 --> 02:54:18,360
I don't think so.

2865
02:54:18,420 --> 02:54:20,400
I think that's like a blue filter.

2866
02:54:20,400 --> 02:54:22,060
A blue foggy filter.

2867
02:54:22,660 --> 02:54:22,960
Is it?

2868
02:54:25,020 --> 02:54:26,500
Oh my gosh.

2869
02:54:27,240 --> 02:54:27,380
Boo!

2870
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:30,180
Mazoku!

2871
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:31,400
Thanks for 3 bonds!

2872
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:32,160
OK.

2873
02:54:37,140 --> 02:54:38,140
I must...

2874
02:54:38,140 --> 02:54:39,700
I don't know if I go in.

2875
02:54:39,800 --> 02:54:42,240
If I go to the left or go straight or go where?

2876
02:54:48,810 --> 02:54:50,850
All I know is I must go!

2877
02:54:52,530 --> 02:54:53,770
I must go somewhere!

2878
02:54:54,090 --> 02:54:55,190
I think it's this one.

2879
02:54:56,430 --> 02:54:57,510
Oh my God.

2880
02:54:57,930 --> 02:54:58,350
Lady.

2881
02:54:59,290 --> 02:55:00,230
I found it!

2882
02:55:12,740 --> 02:55:14,300
She's scared and so am I.

2883
02:55:14,740 --> 02:55:15,200
I know.

2884
02:55:15,380 --> 02:55:16,040
My little baby.

2885
02:55:16,380 --> 02:55:16,920
Don't worry.

2886
02:55:18,260 --> 02:55:19,460
I'll get us out of here baby!

2887
02:55:20,820 --> 02:55:21,560
I'm running!

2888
02:55:25,080 --> 02:55:25,840
What the?

2889
02:55:26,540 --> 02:55:27,000
Wait!

2890
02:55:27,380 --> 02:55:27,740
Wait!

2891
02:55:28,120 --> 02:55:29,140
What are you talking about?

2892
02:55:47,140 --> 02:55:48,940
This game is horrid!

2893
02:55:49,100 --> 02:55:49,940
Oh my God.

2894
02:55:51,140 --> 02:55:51,820
Oh,

2895
02:55:55,620 --> 02:55:56,600
it's just the little babies.

2896
02:55:56,800 --> 02:55:56,940
OK.

2897
02:55:57,680 --> 02:55:58,880
Nevermind, I can handle these.

2898
02:56:00,880 --> 02:56:02,640
This game is so horrid.

2899
02:56:03,300 --> 02:56:04,460
I swear to God.

2900
02:56:07,920 --> 02:56:08,600
OK.

2901
02:56:09,780 --> 02:56:10,900
Oh my gosh.

2902
02:56:12,480 --> 02:56:13,120
My

2903
02:56:17,660 --> 02:56:18,160
baby!

2904
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:19,500
My baby is smiling.

2905
02:56:19,880 --> 02:56:20,780
She's really happy.

2906
02:56:28,410 --> 02:56:30,970
Did I just hear a piano go boop?

2907
02:56:31,590 --> 02:56:34,410
Did I just hear one piano little boop?

2908
02:56:36,270 --> 02:56:36,910
OK.

2909
02:56:38,630 --> 02:56:42,690
I feel like I should put down the candles first.

2910
02:56:43,690 --> 02:56:45,230
I'm gonna set you down right there baby.

2911
02:56:45,610 --> 02:56:46,210
He's scared.

2912
02:56:54,390 --> 02:56:55,190
OK.

2913
02:57:01,380 --> 02:57:05,560
Any further spirit returns will result in system collapse.

2914
02:57:06,580 --> 02:57:07,240
What does that mean?

2915
02:57:11,020 --> 02:57:11,260
What?

2916
02:57:17,500 --> 02:57:19,500
Choose a monster.

2917
02:57:22,020 --> 02:57:22,680
What do you want?

2918
02:57:22,820 --> 02:57:23,340
String bean?

2919
02:57:25,600 --> 02:57:26,400
Broccoli?

2920
02:57:27,300 --> 02:57:31,760
Or act like the most stereotypical demon you've ever seen.

2921
02:57:35,160 --> 02:57:35,960
Wait.

2922
02:57:36,240 --> 02:57:36,680
Puppet.

2923
02:57:38,720 --> 02:57:39,980
Oh no!

2924
02:57:41,120 --> 02:57:42,640
Oh no!

2925
02:57:50,860 --> 02:57:56,260
I remember these guys, but the puppet I think was the easiest to deal with.

2926
02:58:01,080 --> 02:58:03,120
Wait, so am I summoning him?

2927
02:58:06,040 --> 02:58:07,280
Which do you want?

2928
02:58:07,420 --> 02:58:08,200
None of them.

2929
02:58:16,050 --> 02:58:17,770
The beep is the most annoying.

2930
02:58:18,730 --> 02:58:20,330
Wait, so why am I doing this?

2931
02:58:22,870 --> 02:58:26,590
Why am I summoning a guy and then just unsummon him?

2932
02:58:30,050 --> 02:58:32,450
The dear spoopy mansion would I miss?

2933
02:58:32,690 --> 02:58:33,210
Meep!

2934
02:58:33,250 --> 02:58:34,090
Thanks for the ping!

2935
02:58:42,390 --> 02:58:49,690
Oh, because if I summon this guy it will be a system overload so they won't be able to summon anything else.

2936
02:58:52,550 --> 02:58:55,310
I don't remember what was the deer's issue.

2937
02:58:56,370 --> 02:58:58,370
I just remember I got the axe from him.

2938
02:59:03,290 --> 02:59:05,430
If anything, let's summon this guy.

2939
02:59:06,190 --> 02:59:08,350
And if I hate it, I can always reload.

2940
02:59:11,330 --> 02:59:12,730
Spirit already active.

2941
02:59:13,470 --> 02:59:14,530
Lead back to hell gate.

2942
02:59:14,690 --> 02:59:15,950
Sourced to return.

2943
02:59:20,210 --> 02:59:22,390
This door is sealed during the ritual.

2944
02:59:23,730 --> 02:59:25,730
What do you mean it's sealed during the ritual?

2945
02:59:26,550 --> 02:59:27,470
Turn off the ritual!

2946
02:59:29,450 --> 02:59:30,610
Turn off the ritual!

2947
02:59:30,610 --> 02:59:30,830
No!

2948
02:59:37,190 --> 02:59:38,590
Just turn it off!

2949
02:59:39,110 --> 02:59:39,930
He's so loud.

2950
02:59:39,990 --> 02:59:40,910
I know I'm turning it down.

2951
02:59:42,210 --> 02:59:43,650
Just turn it off!

2952
02:59:45,310 --> 02:59:46,830
Oh, I think I have to kill him.

2953
02:59:51,940 --> 02:59:52,960
He got me though.

2954
02:59:57,980 --> 02:59:58,380
Ouch!

2955
03:00:22,610 --> 03:00:23,010
Hello?

2956
03:00:23,470 --> 03:00:24,270
Get him in the circle?

2957
03:00:25,630 --> 03:00:26,030
Ouch!

2958
03:00:26,130 --> 03:00:26,250
Ouch!

2959
03:00:26,350 --> 03:00:26,370
Ouch!

2960
03:00:30,820 --> 03:00:32,560
How do I just get him in the circle?

2961
03:00:32,740 --> 03:00:34,680
Oh gosh guys, I think I'm going to die here for real.

2962
03:00:41,370 --> 03:00:42,210
He's in the circle?

2963
03:00:44,590 --> 03:00:45,530
Oh, this way!

2964
03:00:49,210 --> 03:00:50,690
Oh my gosh, what was that?

2965
03:00:51,710 --> 03:00:52,110
Ouch!

2966
03:00:52,170 --> 03:00:52,330
Ouch!

2967
03:00:52,470 --> 03:00:52,550
Ouch!

2968
03:00:52,710 --> 03:00:53,670
Oh shoot!

2969
03:00:54,150 --> 03:00:55,590
Oh my gosh guys, this is not good.

2970
03:00:56,070 --> 03:00:57,770
I wasted too much time in that one room.

2971
03:00:58,730 --> 03:01:00,610
I wasted too much time in that one room.

2972
03:01:05,920 --> 03:01:06,880
This is not good.

2973
03:01:08,640 --> 03:01:09,400
This is not good.

2974
03:01:09,460 --> 03:01:10,240
I wasted too much time.

2975
03:01:17,380 --> 03:01:18,360
Remember the strat?

2976
03:01:18,460 --> 03:01:19,120
What's the strat?

2977
03:01:33,590 --> 03:01:35,830
Oh gosh guys, I'm going to die.

2978
03:01:36,150 --> 03:01:36,630
I

2979
03:01:50,290 --> 03:01:51,350
wasted too much time.

2980
03:01:51,490 --> 03:01:51,890
I'm an idiot.

2981
03:01:52,050 --> 03:01:52,470
I'm an idiot.

2982
03:01:52,570 --> 03:01:53,030
I'm an idiot.

2983
03:02:34,220 --> 03:02:35,900
Oh my gosh.

2984
03:02:48,930 --> 03:02:49,750
Not yet.

2985
03:02:49,890 --> 03:02:50,770
It's not over yet.

2986
03:02:51,730 --> 03:02:55,510
What am I even doing with this whole plot?

2987
03:02:56,870 --> 03:02:57,390
Oh wait.

2988
03:02:58,550 --> 03:02:59,790
Sorry, I went the wrong way.

2989
03:03:14,260 --> 03:03:16,560
Guys, I have to survive this guy.

2990
03:03:17,200 --> 03:03:18,360
He's kind of cracked.

2991
03:03:19,240 --> 03:03:20,540
He's kind of insane.

2992
03:03:21,520 --> 03:03:21,800
Can I?

2993
03:03:21,940 --> 03:03:23,660
So I can't bring her though, I'm guessing.

2994
03:03:27,610 --> 03:03:31,050
It doesn't seem like... Oh I can't because I need the axe.

2995
03:03:32,630 --> 03:03:34,710
Oh, I don't need the axe.

2996
03:03:35,990 --> 03:03:37,430
I don't know actually.

2997
03:03:39,930 --> 03:03:41,990
Before we try again, how about trying the tram first?

2998
03:03:42,110 --> 03:03:42,490
Oh ok.

2999
03:03:50,220 --> 03:03:52,580
I guess I don't need the axe.

3000
03:03:53,500 --> 03:03:55,160
Alright doll, let's just leave.

3001
03:03:55,380 --> 03:03:56,600
Let's just get the hell out of here.

3002
03:03:58,220 --> 03:03:59,020
Bye everybody!

3003
03:04:02,980 --> 03:04:05,180
Oh my gosh, it's just like a Disney ride.

3004
03:04:10,960 --> 03:04:12,500
Where do you want to sit doll?

3005
03:04:13,120 --> 03:04:15,400
My little baby, let's sit right here.

3006
03:04:19,730 --> 03:04:20,250
Relaxing.

3007
03:04:22,790 --> 03:04:24,270
Are we going to see a skelly?

3008
03:04:24,990 --> 03:04:26,310
I sure hope not.

3009
03:04:27,950 --> 03:04:30,070
I don't want to stand too close to the glass.

3010
03:04:37,930 --> 03:04:38,570
What happened?

3011
03:04:39,610 --> 03:04:41,190
This is supposed to go to the surface.

3012
03:04:42,430 --> 03:04:43,630
What could have happened?

3013
03:04:45,350 --> 03:04:46,270
It's locked.

3014
03:04:52,370 --> 03:04:53,510
I'm scared!

3015
03:04:53,970 --> 03:04:54,710
I'm scared!

3016
03:05:02,110 --> 03:05:03,530
Ashes to ashes.

3017
03:05:03,730 --> 03:05:04,910
Bones to squeeze.

3018
03:05:05,190 --> 03:05:07,890
Your corpse will slowly turn to cheese.

3019
03:05:11,510 --> 03:05:14,210
That was... anticlimactic.

3020
03:05:15,090 --> 03:05:16,950
You missed the red skeleton.

3021
03:05:17,110 --> 03:05:17,650
Oh well.

3022
03:05:23,210 --> 03:05:24,850
That was kind of lame.

3023
03:05:27,730 --> 03:05:28,750
Oh well.

3024
03:05:30,290 --> 03:05:32,770
It ain't easy being cheesy.

3025
03:05:33,230 --> 03:05:34,730
Yeah, so true.

3026
03:05:37,450 --> 03:05:39,110
Oh gosh guys.

3027
03:05:39,870 --> 03:05:42,570
I guess I don't need my axe.

3028
03:05:43,430 --> 03:05:45,470
I feel comfortable with it.

3029
03:05:47,090 --> 03:05:47,990
You know?

3030
03:05:47,990 --> 03:05:49,990
And my axe.

3031
03:06:12,140 --> 03:06:13,860
Which one is the deer?

3032
03:06:14,700 --> 03:06:16,260
What does the deer one do again?

3033
03:06:28,970 --> 03:06:31,010
Makes the screen all staticky.

3034
03:06:31,710 --> 03:06:32,170
That's it?

3035
03:06:32,390 --> 03:06:33,230
I just have to run?

3036
03:06:34,410 --> 03:06:35,230
Wait, what was that?

3037
03:06:36,570 --> 03:06:37,270
What did it say?

3038
03:06:40,270 --> 03:06:42,110
Doll's spirit interference.

3039
03:06:42,210 --> 03:06:43,270
Place outside room.

3040
03:06:43,550 --> 03:06:44,370
No!

3041
03:06:49,920 --> 03:06:51,240
That's why.

3042
03:06:51,960 --> 03:06:53,220
I'm sorry.

3043
03:06:53,560 --> 03:06:55,140
I'm sorry my little baby.

3044
03:06:55,260 --> 03:06:55,840
I'll be back.

3045
03:06:56,240 --> 03:06:57,620
I'm going to hell!

3046
03:07:01,080 --> 03:07:01,500
OK.

3047
03:07:04,420 --> 03:07:05,740
Akira Genesis.

3048
03:07:18,870 --> 03:07:21,490
So, I just run with the deer?

3049
03:07:25,060 --> 03:07:26,400
I can't remember.

3050
03:07:35,350 --> 03:07:37,450
I can't remember how it was at all.

3051
03:07:38,590 --> 03:07:40,770
Make sure they don't go through walls.

3052
03:07:43,790 --> 03:07:45,410
It's a bit different this time.

3053
03:07:45,770 --> 03:07:47,490
Move super fast through the walls.

3054
03:07:48,910 --> 03:07:49,710
Oh, wait.

3055
03:07:50,170 --> 03:07:50,410
Wait.

3056
03:07:51,650 --> 03:07:53,730
Is he the one that I just kind of like inch back?

3057
03:07:53,870 --> 03:07:54,090
No.

3058
03:07:55,270 --> 03:07:59,870
There was one that was just like I had to like... No, that one was like an eyeball kind of thing.

3059
03:08:00,390 --> 03:08:05,310
I don't know which one would be easiest.

3060
03:08:12,090 --> 03:08:13,630
Yeah, he would talk to me.

3061
03:08:13,790 --> 03:08:14,350
Yeah, yeah.

3062
03:08:14,490 --> 03:08:16,030
I'm not picking the beef.

3063
03:08:17,130 --> 03:08:18,970
That one would hide doors.

3064
03:08:19,070 --> 03:08:20,970
You guys, that would make this thing impossible.

3065
03:08:21,190 --> 03:08:22,230
I can't have that.

3066
03:08:23,650 --> 03:08:24,190
I can't.

3067
03:08:24,250 --> 03:08:25,630
He will hide the doors.

3068
03:08:25,750 --> 03:08:26,810
It will make it impossible.

3069
03:08:28,990 --> 03:08:30,830
You guys only remember the beef.

3070
03:08:30,890 --> 03:08:34,530
You don't remember the frustration of him making the doors disappear!

3071
03:08:38,350 --> 03:08:40,170
Yeah, I do have beef with him.

3072
03:08:44,010 --> 03:08:45,710
I guess I'll try the deer.

3073
03:08:47,910 --> 03:08:49,330
Lead back to hell gate.

3074
03:08:49,410 --> 03:08:50,270
Source to return.

3075
03:08:51,170 --> 03:09:00,330
Oh my

3076
03:09:03,420 --> 03:09:07,640
god.

3077
03:09:15,660 --> 03:09:16,480
Oh my god.

3078
03:09:16,560 --> 03:09:19,620
I just found a dead end and the deer are coming after me.

3079
03:09:19,800 --> 03:09:21,180
Oh my god.

3080
03:09:21,360 --> 03:09:23,280
The flashing lights are so bad.

3081
03:09:25,480 --> 03:09:28,040
I think the puppet was easier.

3082
03:09:34,410 --> 03:09:35,990
Is this a dead end?

3083
03:09:36,110 --> 03:09:37,090
Oh my god.

3084
03:09:37,290 --> 03:09:38,010
Just kill me.

3085
03:09:42,730 --> 03:09:43,510
Oh my god.

3086
03:09:43,550 --> 03:09:44,110
And the deer.

3087
03:09:44,110 --> 03:09:46,210
Where is the door?

3088
03:09:54,890 --> 03:09:56,170
Join us.

3089
03:09:58,050 --> 03:09:59,650
Please let the door be over here.

3090
03:10:01,950 --> 03:10:03,650
Please let there be a door here.

3091
03:10:07,170 --> 03:10:09,230
Oh my gosh guys.

3092
03:10:13,530 --> 03:10:14,850
My children.

3093
03:10:26,150 --> 03:10:27,910
Where is the door?

3094
03:10:28,130 --> 03:10:28,530
Oh here.

3095
03:10:32,410 --> 03:10:33,690
Oh my gosh.

3096
03:10:33,910 --> 03:10:35,490
One HP and a dream.

3097
03:10:40,830 --> 03:10:41,950
Join us.

3098
03:10:43,710 --> 03:10:45,830
Is this a loop?

3099
03:10:46,710 --> 03:10:48,950
Or is it actually going to end?

3100
03:10:58,520 --> 03:11:01,540
Your submission is inevitable.

3101
03:11:01,800 --> 03:11:04,860
I think I have to not run so much because then it will go through the walls.

3102
03:11:05,020 --> 03:11:07,280
Why do you run, child?

3103
03:11:07,400 --> 03:11:07,960
Please!

3104
03:11:10,960 --> 03:11:11,480
Please!

3105
03:11:18,910 --> 03:11:20,470
Ok, let's go this way.

3106
03:11:20,770 --> 03:11:21,710
I found a door.

3107
03:11:22,590 --> 03:11:23,310
Come, come, come.

3108
03:11:31,530 --> 03:11:34,170
I'm going through the same doors over and over again.

3109
03:11:34,610 --> 03:11:36,790
I can't tell if...

3110
03:11:36,790 --> 03:11:37,330
Oh my gosh.

3111
03:11:40,030 --> 03:11:41,010
Come back!

3112
03:11:41,070 --> 03:11:41,510
Come back!

3113
03:11:45,410 --> 03:11:47,810
By a freaking deer!

3114
03:11:47,910 --> 03:11:49,470
I couldn't avoid him!

3115
03:11:49,570 --> 03:11:50,730
There is no way!

3116
03:11:50,970 --> 03:11:52,370
That was so...

3117
03:11:52,370 --> 03:11:54,050
That was so cheap.

3118
03:11:58,460 --> 03:12:00,400
That was so cheap.

3119
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:05,760
But I think maybe he...

3120
03:12:06,360 --> 03:12:08,380
When I got the hang of it...

3121
03:12:08,380 --> 03:12:09,560
I think it was ok.

3122
03:12:10,700 --> 03:12:12,820
Revenge for shooting the deer in faith.

3123
03:12:12,960 --> 03:12:14,000
Didn't I have my revenge?

3124
03:12:14,120 --> 03:12:15,800
The revenge was had.

3125
03:12:17,920 --> 03:12:19,480
You can axe the deers.

3126
03:12:20,280 --> 03:12:21,960
We'll axe the deers.

3127
03:12:24,080 --> 03:12:25,360
No, no beef.

3128
03:12:25,680 --> 03:12:28,440
You guys, I can't even find the doors normally.

3129
03:12:29,800 --> 03:12:32,180
I can't even find the doors normally.

3130
03:12:33,520 --> 03:12:36,780
Finding the doors with the beef will be impossible.

3131
03:12:36,780 --> 03:12:39,180
You guys are really trying to kill me.

3132
03:12:39,320 --> 03:12:40,600
I'm not listening to you.

3133
03:12:46,430 --> 03:12:47,450
Let's go.

3134
03:12:52,630 --> 03:12:53,750
Well, I...

3135
03:12:53,750 --> 03:12:55,410
Oh, it didn't kill me.

3136
03:12:59,830 --> 03:13:01,150
It's kind of fast.

3137
03:13:02,670 --> 03:13:04,810
I feel like I was so close too.

3138
03:13:08,270 --> 03:13:10,230
I feel like I was so close.

3139
03:13:11,290 --> 03:13:11,870
Oh,

3140
03:13:15,910 --> 03:13:16,610
I'm getting hit.

3141
03:13:16,850 --> 03:13:17,430
I'm getting hurt.

3142
03:13:25,270 --> 03:13:25,850
Oucha!

3143
03:13:46,200 --> 03:13:47,240
Join us.

3144
03:13:48,580 --> 03:13:51,280
I know I can axe the deer, but I gotta get close.

3145
03:13:52,940 --> 03:13:54,680
See, it still hurt me in the end.

3146
03:13:56,060 --> 03:13:56,740
Kind of lame.

3147
03:14:04,140 --> 03:14:05,180
My children.

3148
03:14:05,860 --> 03:14:07,600
What about my baby?

3149
03:14:08,060 --> 03:14:09,880
What about my child?

3150
03:14:11,200 --> 03:14:12,480
I'm also a parent.

3151
03:14:13,580 --> 03:14:15,760
Please don't let this be a dead end.

3152
03:14:15,840 --> 03:14:16,280
Please.

3153
03:14:16,640 --> 03:14:17,460
Please, God.

3154
03:14:18,100 --> 03:14:18,840
Where's the door?

3155
03:14:21,880 --> 03:14:22,180
Okay.

3156
03:14:38,420 --> 03:14:39,700
Oh, shoot!

3157
03:14:40,180 --> 03:14:40,620
No!

3158
03:14:43,500 --> 03:14:44,300
Oh my God.

3159
03:14:44,340 --> 03:14:46,200
Now it's actually 1 HP and a drink.

3160
03:14:52,710 --> 03:14:53,830
This is the worst.

3161
03:14:54,830 --> 03:14:56,390
This is actually the worst.

3162
03:14:56,870 --> 03:14:58,010
This is actually the worst.

3163
03:15:01,170 --> 03:15:02,510
Oh, this is it.

3164
03:15:02,690 --> 03:15:03,510
Guys, this is it.

3165
03:15:11,690 --> 03:15:14,610
Wait, what's happening?

3166
03:15:20,060 --> 03:15:21,380
What's happening?

3167
03:15:26,990 --> 03:15:28,930
I've never seen this before.

3168
03:15:30,050 --> 03:15:31,410
Oh, hello!

3169
03:15:52,170 --> 03:15:52,690
Ah!

3170
03:16:11,400 --> 03:16:13,440
Deer is the hardest one?

3171
03:16:13,520 --> 03:16:13,800
Really?

3172
03:16:14,140 --> 03:16:16,200
Everyone said that the beef was the hardest.

3173
03:16:28,510 --> 03:16:29,090
Beef?

3174
03:16:29,190 --> 03:16:29,410
Okay.

3175
03:16:32,880 --> 03:16:35,300
So the beef is gonna...

3176
03:16:35,940 --> 03:16:38,180
The beef is gonna...

3177
03:16:38,180 --> 03:16:40,560
Make the doors disappear, right?

3178
03:16:41,200 --> 03:16:42,600
What else does he do?

3179
03:16:44,340 --> 03:16:46,040
He just runs at me, right?

3180
03:16:46,940 --> 03:16:49,940
He doesn't go through walls at least, but...

3181
03:17:02,240 --> 03:17:03,640
Just makes doors invisible.

3182
03:17:04,240 --> 03:17:07,280
How will I find the doors though, you guys?

3183
03:17:08,360 --> 03:17:10,440
I'm never gonna make it out of here.

3184
03:17:13,700 --> 03:17:15,600
He does go through walls?

3185
03:17:16,600 --> 03:17:19,300
He can still go through the walls, what's the point?

3186
03:17:31,120 --> 03:17:32,980
Maybe the puppet would be easiest.

3187
03:17:32,980 --> 03:17:37,920
But there were all these other little ghosties that were showing up with the puppet.

3188
03:17:38,160 --> 03:17:39,000
It was scaring me.

3189
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:42,260
Oh gosh.

3190
03:17:42,740 --> 03:17:43,620
Might as well try.

3191
03:17:43,820 --> 03:17:45,200
What if I first try it?

3192
03:17:45,420 --> 03:17:46,480
That would be crazy.

3193
03:17:50,760 --> 03:17:51,860
Oh shit.

3194
03:17:53,040 --> 03:17:55,240
Oh my god, no way.

3195
03:17:57,600 --> 03:18:00,060
I'm back in the... Goddamn!

3196
03:18:01,500 --> 03:18:02,600
No way.

3197
03:18:02,600 --> 03:18:02,820
No way.

3198
03:18:03,300 --> 03:18:06,100
I'm back in the goddamn pizzeria.

3199
03:18:10,420 --> 03:18:11,180
Oh gosh.

3200
03:18:18,880 --> 03:18:19,400
Beef!

3201
03:18:24,510 --> 03:18:27,550
Wait, this might be...

3202
03:18:27,550 --> 03:18:28,330
Oh my gosh.

3203
03:18:28,790 --> 03:18:29,290
Where is he?

3204
03:18:38,580 --> 03:18:39,460
OK.

3205
03:18:39,460 --> 03:18:39,660
OK.

3206
03:18:43,400 --> 03:18:46,440
If the hallways aren't so complicated, it might be OK.

3207
03:18:46,540 --> 03:18:47,380
Like this, you know?

3208
03:18:48,100 --> 03:18:49,960
Like I can tell, obviously.

3209
03:18:52,340 --> 03:18:54,900
But the other hallways would have been impossible.

3210
03:18:55,120 --> 03:18:56,480
Oh my gosh, all the beef everywhere.

3211
03:18:57,620 --> 03:18:58,560
You think it's here?

3212
03:19:00,020 --> 03:19:00,900
Oh my gosh.

3213
03:19:04,820 --> 03:19:05,780
The beef.

3214
03:19:07,240 --> 03:19:07,940
I hear him.

3215
03:19:12,960 --> 03:19:14,300
Oh my gosh, please.

3216
03:19:26,200 --> 03:19:26,680
Please.

3217
03:19:36,090 --> 03:19:36,970
I hear him.

3218
03:19:37,790 --> 03:19:38,370
Oh my god.

3219
03:19:43,550 --> 03:19:45,270
I love when it appears back.

3220
03:19:46,290 --> 03:19:48,930
Like, oh, by the way...

3221
03:19:50,770 --> 03:19:52,550
Oh my god, he's right behind me, isn't he?

3222
03:20:03,420 --> 03:20:04,080
OK.

3223
03:20:04,680 --> 03:20:06,100
How much more, you guys?

3224
03:20:06,220 --> 03:20:07,180
How much more?

3225
03:20:08,380 --> 03:20:10,260
How much more of this hell?

3226
03:20:14,720 --> 03:20:15,380
Please!

3227
03:20:16,420 --> 03:20:16,980
Please!

3228
03:20:19,600 --> 03:20:20,220
Oh my god.

3229
03:20:21,960 --> 03:20:23,460
Is it here?

3230
03:20:23,680 --> 03:20:23,940
Yes!

3231
03:20:33,240 --> 03:20:34,300
Oh my god.

3232
03:20:34,780 --> 03:20:35,220
Game!

3233
03:20:35,220 --> 03:20:37,460
Game, please!

3234
03:20:38,720 --> 03:20:39,200
Oh my god.

3235
03:20:44,640 --> 03:20:45,680
Please be it.

3236
03:20:54,220 --> 03:20:55,720
I found it.

3237
03:21:02,530 --> 03:21:03,650
One hit though.

3238
03:21:04,310 --> 03:21:04,630
Whatever.

3239
03:21:05,350 --> 03:21:05,810
Whatever.

3240
03:21:06,110 --> 03:21:06,590
One hit.

3241
03:21:10,450 --> 03:21:11,330
This is it.

3242
03:21:11,870 --> 03:21:16,420
Oh my god.

3243
03:21:17,020 --> 03:21:18,060
Please be the end.

3244
03:21:19,480 --> 03:21:21,200
Please be the end.

3245
03:21:27,280 --> 03:21:28,160
Upstairs?

3246
03:21:30,820 --> 03:21:31,300
Oh my god.

3247
03:21:34,220 --> 03:21:35,700
And then downstairs.

3248
03:21:41,330 --> 03:21:41,830
What?

3249
03:21:44,150 --> 03:21:45,470
No way.

3250
03:21:46,090 --> 03:21:46,950
No way!

3251
03:21:47,070 --> 03:21:47,730
No, please!

3252
03:21:48,890 --> 03:21:49,590
I can't!

3253
03:21:49,630 --> 03:21:50,250
I can't!

3254
03:21:50,350 --> 03:21:50,650
Exit!

3255
03:21:52,070 --> 03:21:53,110
Oh my god.

3256
03:21:53,290 --> 03:21:53,670
No!

3257
03:21:56,590 --> 03:21:58,230
Oh my god.

3258
03:22:00,010 --> 03:22:01,410
What the hell is this?

3259
03:22:15,920 --> 03:22:17,960
Near death experience.

3260
03:22:18,300 --> 03:22:19,860
Almost got you.

3261
03:22:20,320 --> 03:22:23,440
Oh my god, I actually did first try the beef!

3262
03:22:27,990 --> 03:22:29,990
I first tried the beef.

3263
03:22:36,320 --> 03:22:36,840
Save?

3264
03:22:37,080 --> 03:22:37,920
Oh yeah, true.

3265
03:22:39,020 --> 03:22:39,800
Wait, no.

3266
03:22:39,920 --> 03:22:41,600
We are just about to end the game, right?

3267
03:22:42,680 --> 03:22:44,320
I guess I should save though.

3268
03:22:44,960 --> 03:22:45,700
I'll save.

3269
03:22:48,460 --> 03:22:50,020
Oh my gosh.

3270
03:22:55,880 --> 03:22:56,400
Guys...

3271
03:22:57,340 --> 03:22:57,860
We...

3272
03:22:58,480 --> 03:22:59,000
Game...

3273
03:23:11,060 --> 03:23:14,220
Ok, let's go put this to rest.

3274
03:23:14,860 --> 03:23:15,820
Maybe, I guess.

3275
03:23:16,440 --> 03:23:17,340
And then we can leave.

3276
03:23:18,340 --> 03:23:19,320
So we seal?

3277
03:23:23,940 --> 03:23:25,060
We seal?

3278
03:23:29,560 --> 03:23:31,280
I survived the beef.

3279
03:23:31,460 --> 03:23:34,800
That crawling area was absolute hellish.

3280
03:23:35,100 --> 03:23:40,120
You can't run through there, so you are just crawling and he is just kicking your ass while you do it.

3281
03:23:42,240 --> 03:23:43,860
Should have checked the other ending first.

3282
03:23:43,900 --> 03:23:44,060
What?

3283
03:23:44,160 --> 03:23:46,060
I don't know what other ending there is.

3284
03:23:46,480 --> 03:23:47,920
Wait, I don't understand.

3285
03:23:48,720 --> 03:23:50,260
Wait, what do you mean the other ending?

3286
03:23:51,780 --> 03:23:52,960
One guide to save.

3287
03:23:53,120 --> 03:23:53,320
What?

3288
03:23:53,400 --> 03:23:55,500
There was multiple people saying to save.

3289
03:23:55,680 --> 03:23:57,200
You know guys, it's fine.

3290
03:23:57,760 --> 03:24:00,000
It's ok if we don't get every ending.

3291
03:24:00,240 --> 03:24:01,040
Don't worry.

3292
03:24:01,620 --> 03:24:02,480
It's ok.

3293
03:24:04,080 --> 03:24:07,180
The other ending was releasing the nightmare without closing the hell gate.

3294
03:24:07,180 --> 03:24:10,680
Oh well, I'm way too late of that.

3295
03:24:12,080 --> 03:24:13,960
I already did the hell gate.

3296
03:24:17,500 --> 03:24:18,100
Whatever.

3297
03:24:19,460 --> 03:24:20,200
Goodbye baby.

3298
03:24:21,080 --> 03:24:22,060
My baby.

3299
03:24:24,080 --> 03:24:27,820
Oh my god, probably the bitrate is going insane right now.

3300
03:24:27,920 --> 03:24:28,800
Goodbye baby!

3301
03:24:33,240 --> 03:24:34,680
It was a nightmare.

3302
03:24:35,420 --> 03:24:36,540
Oh my gosh, my eyes.

3303
03:24:37,460 --> 03:24:39,260
The night I saw the devil.

3304
03:24:41,320 --> 03:24:42,020
Oh.

3305
03:24:54,600 --> 03:24:56,420
What the hell is that?

3306
03:24:56,880 --> 03:24:57,420
What's yelling?

3307
03:24:58,980 --> 03:25:00,740
Oh my god.

3308
03:25:07,680 --> 03:25:09,300
What the heck is this?

3309
03:25:12,000 --> 03:25:12,920
Oh ok.

3310
03:25:13,400 --> 03:25:14,620
Can I get more bullets?

3311
03:25:14,620 --> 03:25:14,700
Bullets.

3312
03:25:21,100 --> 03:25:23,240
Oh ok, I reload.

3313
03:25:23,880 --> 03:25:24,340
Nice.

3314
03:25:26,380 --> 03:25:26,760
Where?

3315
03:25:28,840 --> 03:25:30,720
These flashing lights are kind of crazy.

3316
03:25:30,900 --> 03:25:31,940
I'm so sorry guys.

3317
03:25:39,240 --> 03:25:40,060
The ping?

3318
03:25:40,220 --> 03:25:41,100
What do you mean the ping?

3319
03:25:56,430 --> 03:25:57,790
I can't believe there's more.

3320
03:26:01,010 --> 03:26:01,570
Ok.

3321
03:26:03,310 --> 03:26:05,670
Follow where the ghost guys come from I guess.

3322
03:26:06,790 --> 03:26:07,550
Oh my gosh!

3323
03:26:19,320 --> 03:26:21,380
Why do you guys keep saying ping?

3324
03:26:24,340 --> 03:26:26,100
It really is doom now, huh?

3325
03:26:26,240 --> 03:26:26,980
Oh no!

3326
03:26:29,580 --> 03:26:30,920
Am I ok?

3327
03:26:31,620 --> 03:26:33,080
I can't see anything game!

3328
03:26:33,080 --> 03:26:34,980
Everything is red!

3329
03:26:35,860 --> 03:26:36,200
Oh ok.

3330
03:26:36,540 --> 03:26:37,060
We recover.

3331
03:26:37,280 --> 03:26:37,820
We recover.

3332
03:26:41,820 --> 03:26:43,040
We recover.

3333
03:26:43,200 --> 03:26:43,680
We recover.

3334
03:26:52,310 --> 03:26:53,070
Perfect.

3335
03:26:55,530 --> 03:26:56,290
Ok.

3336
03:26:58,650 --> 03:27:00,090
Funny ping gun.

3337
03:27:00,990 --> 03:27:02,330
Oh it makes a ping noise.

3338
03:27:02,730 --> 03:27:05,030
I guess it dies.

3339
03:27:08,730 --> 03:27:11,390
1, 2, 3, 4.

3340
03:27:15,750 --> 03:27:17,190
1, 2.

3341
03:27:17,590 --> 03:27:18,130
Hold on.

3342
03:27:19,910 --> 03:27:20,530
There we go.

3343
03:27:22,150 --> 03:27:23,950
Tactical reload.

3344
03:27:24,290 --> 03:27:28,050
And that's why we tactical reload everybody.

3345
03:27:31,990 --> 03:27:34,230
What is this?

3346
03:27:42,300 --> 03:27:44,300
Is this the new...

3347
03:27:44,840 --> 03:27:47,680
Gosh, you can do so much in Jeezy Doom, huh?

3348
03:27:52,840 --> 03:27:54,840
Is this the hallway to go down?

3349
03:27:55,000 --> 03:27:56,900
Seems like it could be.

3350
03:28:00,180 --> 03:28:00,700
Spooky?

3351
03:28:03,400 --> 03:28:04,300
Oh spooky!

3352
03:28:04,540 --> 03:28:05,620
Oh no!

3353
03:28:05,740 --> 03:28:06,400
I shot her!

3354
03:28:06,940 --> 03:28:09,940
I mean not me, but spooky!

3355
03:28:11,380 --> 03:28:14,400
The PTSD is what they were talking about.

3356
03:28:15,460 --> 03:28:16,900
I didn't shoot her!

3357
03:28:17,280 --> 03:28:18,440
I didn't do it!

3358
03:28:23,980 --> 03:28:26,980
And so then they put spooky into the building.

3359
03:28:27,340 --> 03:28:28,660
They had her possess it.

3360
03:28:39,920 --> 03:28:41,300
Someone is sleeping here.

3361
03:28:41,460 --> 03:28:42,540
Plant the gun on them.

3362
03:28:44,020 --> 03:28:46,040
I just framed some guy?

3363
03:28:46,420 --> 03:28:47,620
I can't lose you.

3364
03:28:47,780 --> 03:28:48,920
Oh my gosh!

3365
03:28:48,920 --> 03:28:51,360
I will bring you back.

3366
03:28:51,880 --> 03:28:53,240
This is so FNAF.

3367
03:29:10,220 --> 03:29:11,260
JPEG DOCTOR!

3368
03:29:16,580 --> 03:29:17,100
Amazing.

3369
03:29:17,300 --> 03:29:18,020
Mission complete.

3370
03:29:18,640 --> 03:29:21,660
I always wanted to tell you how that night really ended.

3371
03:29:22,600 --> 03:29:23,400
But I couldn't.

3372
03:29:23,580 --> 03:29:24,560
Because you were gone.

3373
03:29:25,060 --> 03:29:25,980
I need your forgiveness.

3374
03:29:26,440 --> 03:29:28,480
That's why I wanted you back at any cost.

3375
03:29:28,900 --> 03:29:31,940
But in the end I robbed you of both life and un-life.

3376
03:29:32,500 --> 03:29:34,240
Please go on and be with Monika.

3377
03:29:34,780 --> 03:29:35,500
I'm sorry.

3378
03:29:40,080 --> 03:29:43,000
So if we run around now there is no ghost and stuff?

3379
03:29:47,140 --> 03:29:47,740
Nevermind.

3380
03:29:47,740 --> 03:29:48,340
No...

3381
03:29:48,340 --> 03:29:52,540
Oh gosh!

3382
03:29:52,680 --> 03:29:53,540
OK, nevermind!

3383
03:29:57,240 --> 03:29:58,500
Time to leave!

3384
03:30:01,100 --> 03:30:02,320
What the hell are you?

3385
03:30:02,780 --> 03:30:03,520
Oh gosh!

3386
03:30:07,740 --> 03:30:08,560
Time to go!

3387
03:30:08,860 --> 03:30:09,560
Time to go!

3388
03:30:15,500 --> 03:30:16,580
What was that?

3389
03:30:22,040 --> 03:30:23,740
Are we going to make it out in time?

3390
03:30:24,400 --> 03:30:25,480
Are we going to make it out in time?

3391
03:30:31,540 --> 03:30:32,720
Everything is turning white.

3392
03:30:33,160 --> 03:30:33,660
Did we do it?

3393
03:30:52,120 --> 03:30:54,060
We got rid of the mansion!

3394
03:30:59,840 --> 03:31:00,840
Bye Spirits!

3395
03:31:00,920 --> 03:31:01,960
Wait, does that include me?

3396
03:31:18,920 --> 03:31:19,920
Good ending!

3397
03:31:20,320 --> 03:31:21,240
I couldn't read the rest.

3398
03:31:21,900 --> 03:31:22,400
Sorry.

3399
03:31:24,440 --> 03:31:25,400
Yay!

3400
03:31:29,420 --> 03:31:31,660
The nightmare is finally over.

3401
03:31:32,260 --> 03:31:32,740
Yay!

3402
03:31:39,920 --> 03:31:41,900
We did it!

3403
03:31:42,500 --> 03:31:46,300
I completed Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion.

3404
03:31:50,260 --> 03:31:52,480
Look at the art, so cute.

3405
03:31:52,680 --> 03:31:54,120
Oh Spooky, happy birthday!

3406
03:31:55,380 --> 03:31:58,180
Spooky eating sushi, I think.

3407
03:31:58,420 --> 03:31:59,940
There is definitely a bottle of soy sauce.

3408
03:32:01,340 --> 03:32:04,080
Oh my gosh, Nurse Spooky.

3409
03:32:04,780 --> 03:32:05,180
Cute.

3410
03:32:06,520 --> 03:32:07,960
Little baby Spooky.

3411
03:32:08,440 --> 03:32:09,580
Nice Spooky!

3412
03:32:11,440 --> 03:32:13,560
Spooky with a machine gun!

3413
03:32:15,360 --> 03:32:16,540
Fix it Spooky.

3414
03:32:17,620 --> 03:32:18,620
Oh no!

3415
03:32:19,120 --> 03:32:20,520
Spooky with Kyubey!

3416
03:32:20,520 --> 03:32:20,980
What?

3417
03:32:22,660 --> 03:32:24,800
Everything on fire Spooky!

3418
03:32:26,220 --> 03:32:28,140
I got a knife Spooky.

3419
03:32:28,520 --> 03:32:29,540
Sketchy Spooky.

3420
03:32:34,820 --> 03:32:36,240
Sketchy Spooky.

3421
03:32:42,920 --> 03:32:45,000
We did it guys!

3422
03:32:45,120 --> 03:32:46,720
We did it!

3423
03:32:46,880 --> 03:32:47,840
Let's go!

3424
03:32:49,440 --> 03:32:51,020
Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion.

3425
03:32:52,880 --> 03:32:53,360
Finish!

3426
03:32:54,920 --> 03:33:00,720
Sorry I couldn't get the other ending where I did it without closing the hell gate.

3427
03:33:02,520 --> 03:33:03,380
But, whatever.

3428
03:33:03,760 --> 03:33:05,420
You can always... I'll YouTube it.

3429
03:33:06,820 --> 03:33:09,220
And you can too, if you want to see that ending.

3430
03:33:10,680 --> 03:33:11,660
Yeah, just YouTube.

3431
03:33:11,760 --> 03:33:12,820
There is two other endings?

3432
03:33:13,660 --> 03:33:15,660
Wait, what's the other ending?

3433
03:33:15,820 --> 03:33:17,100
What do you do for the other ending?

3434
03:33:21,560 --> 03:33:23,300
I'm already YouTubing it.

3435
03:33:26,860 --> 03:33:28,420
Endless has new specimen.

3436
03:33:29,080 --> 03:33:32,980
I did see that they like... I guess... What was the last update?

3437
03:33:33,180 --> 03:33:34,760
2023 sometime.

3438
03:33:36,940 --> 03:33:41,000
I saw that they added some little guys to Endless.

3439
03:33:42,140 --> 03:33:44,240
The first ending is not doing the nightmare.

3440
03:33:44,600 --> 03:33:46,760
The second ending is leaving without sealing.

3441
03:33:48,000 --> 03:33:49,000
Not doing the nightmare.

3442
03:33:59,390 --> 03:34:03,550
There is one more ending in the new game plus of Katamari.

3443
03:34:04,830 --> 03:34:06,910
Hospital if you kill your own ghost in the sea.

3444
03:34:06,990 --> 03:34:07,910
You can do that!

3445
03:34:08,370 --> 03:34:10,330
Wait, did I have an axe?

3446
03:34:10,370 --> 03:34:10,970
I guess I did.

3447
03:34:10,970 --> 03:34:13,910
Great job with those spooky DLC.

3448
03:34:14,090 --> 03:34:14,770
You were brave today.

3449
03:34:15,010 --> 03:34:16,510
I was brave!

3450
03:34:18,590 --> 03:34:20,950
And now I'm hungry!

3451
03:34:22,110 --> 03:34:23,770
I'm going to go have dinner.

3452
03:34:24,310 --> 03:34:25,510
Who do I possess today?

3453
03:34:26,670 --> 03:34:27,770
I don't know.

3454
03:34:28,310 --> 03:34:33,690
Who's having a delicious scrumptious dinner tonight that I can possess?

3455
03:34:34,410 --> 03:34:35,910
And eat your food.

3456
03:34:39,570 --> 03:34:43,270
Who's hungry for Minto to eat it?

3457
03:34:45,790 --> 03:34:47,350
My dinner sucked tonight.

3458
03:34:47,470 --> 03:34:48,950
You already ate it.

3459
03:34:49,550 --> 03:34:53,110
Come on guys, think of Minto before you eat.

3460
03:34:54,990 --> 03:34:58,230
If you ever think...

3461
03:34:58,230 --> 03:35:00,390
I think this is going to be a delicious meal.

3462
03:35:00,690 --> 03:35:02,230
I don't mind if I don't have it.

3463
03:35:02,230 --> 03:35:04,150
I don't mind if I don't taste it.

3464
03:35:04,250 --> 03:35:06,190
But Minto would probably love this.

3465
03:35:06,710 --> 03:35:08,810
And you should just let me possess your body.

3466
03:35:09,450 --> 03:35:11,750
Eat your food and be on my merry way.

3467
03:35:13,050 --> 03:35:14,490
Okay, beef for dinner.

3468
03:35:16,390 --> 03:35:18,950
Actually, maybe I will get a burger.

3469
03:35:20,290 --> 03:35:22,090
Chai Princess, thank you!

3470
03:35:24,850 --> 03:35:25,830
Thank you, thank you.

3471
03:35:26,470 --> 03:35:30,150
I can't believe I beefed in my first try.

3472
03:35:30,150 --> 03:35:32,670
I was like, I was so against the beef.

3473
03:35:35,390 --> 03:35:36,510
Thanks for the stream.

3474
03:35:36,730 --> 03:35:37,590
Thanks Salty!

3475
03:35:39,930 --> 03:35:41,990
I can't believe I beefed in my first try.

3476
03:35:42,570 --> 03:35:44,710
Hold on, I can't stand this song.

3477
03:35:44,930 --> 03:35:46,290
Wait, there was another song.

3478
03:35:46,390 --> 03:35:46,810
Well, whatever.

3479
03:35:48,630 --> 03:35:49,390
I'm here now.

3480
03:35:50,970 --> 03:35:52,170
I'm here now.

3481
03:35:55,050 --> 03:35:56,690
The deer is more stylish.

3482
03:35:56,690 --> 03:36:00,610
I think the deer is probably the most difficult one.

3483
03:36:00,730 --> 03:36:05,290
Since you have all of the deer as enemies as well.

3484
03:36:06,230 --> 03:36:07,530
Oh my god!

3485
03:36:07,650 --> 03:36:08,470
Thank you!

3486
03:36:08,530 --> 03:36:09,630
It's okay, it was my birthday yesterday.

3487
03:36:09,770 --> 03:36:10,650
Congrats on good ending.

3488
03:36:11,950 --> 03:36:13,730
Happy late birthday, I'm sorry!

3489
03:36:14,590 --> 03:36:17,190
Happy birthday to you!

3490
03:36:17,630 --> 03:36:19,990
Happy birthday to you!

3491
03:36:20,490 --> 03:36:23,330
Happy birthday, dear Abed!

3492
03:36:25,030 --> 03:36:28,670
Happy birthday to you!

3493
03:36:30,530 --> 03:36:31,430
Happy birthday!

3494
03:36:32,650 --> 03:36:34,290
Thanks for the spooky stream.

3495
03:36:34,430 --> 03:36:39,930
By the way, SlayThePrincess just got a big update yesterday with new endings and 3 new princesses!

3496
03:36:43,700 --> 03:36:45,400
Might have to try it.

3497
03:36:45,580 --> 03:36:47,240
I really like SlayThePrincess.

3498
03:36:50,060 --> 03:36:51,020
More girls.

3499
03:36:52,080 --> 03:36:53,040
More princess.

3500
03:36:54,360 --> 03:36:55,360
That was a good game.

3501
03:36:55,560 --> 03:36:58,140
You know what I was also... I was thinking about playing it next week.

3502
03:36:59,440 --> 03:37:01,720
But I was also like... I don't know, I've played it before.

3503
03:37:02,920 --> 03:37:05,600
But I kind of just wanted to play it for me.

3504
03:37:06,580 --> 03:37:10,000
But I was thinking of next week maybe doing Little Misfortune.

3505
03:37:10,000 --> 03:37:13,040
Do you guys know that game, Little Misfortune?

3506
03:37:14,220 --> 03:37:15,560
Have you guys ever seen it?

3507
03:37:16,080 --> 03:37:19,320
I wanted to maybe try and get the...

3508
03:37:19,320 --> 03:37:21,180
There's like a good, good ending.

3509
03:37:23,000 --> 03:37:24,000
Yes, little lady?

3510
03:37:27,820 --> 03:37:28,700
Yikes forever.

3511
03:37:29,940 --> 03:37:31,160
I feel like I've heard of it.

3512
03:37:31,220 --> 03:37:32,580
It's so good.

3513
03:37:35,520 --> 03:37:37,000
Think it's okay to replay it?

3514
03:37:37,100 --> 03:37:38,280
Would it be okay, I wonder?

3515
03:37:38,280 --> 03:37:40,980
It's kind of... It's Halloween.

3516
03:37:41,980 --> 03:37:42,840
It's a little spooky.

3517
03:37:44,680 --> 03:37:46,400
Never seen it, wow gee.

3518
03:37:46,660 --> 03:37:47,120
Really?

3519
03:37:50,700 --> 03:37:51,220
Fancy.

3520
03:37:54,780 --> 03:37:57,600
It is a goofy but depressing game, it's true.

3521
03:37:59,400 --> 03:38:00,640
I'll think about it.

3522
03:38:01,220 --> 03:38:04,300
I think I have it on my schedule currently, but if I think of another game...

3523
03:38:04,300 --> 03:38:09,420
Because it's technically currently my last spooky game that I have.

3524
03:38:10,560 --> 03:38:13,840
I think for our spooky month.

3525
03:38:14,460 --> 03:38:17,320
Next week I want to do like all spooky games.

3526
03:38:17,900 --> 03:38:19,300
Since we're...

3527
03:38:20,020 --> 03:38:22,300
Oh yeah, because I have...

3528
03:38:23,180 --> 03:38:23,820
Maybe...

3529
03:38:23,820 --> 03:38:26,960
So I have Monday I was going to do Faith.

3530
03:38:27,580 --> 03:38:29,440
And then Tuesday I wasn't going to stream.

3531
03:38:29,900 --> 03:38:32,020
Then Wednesday I was going to do Little Misfortune.

3532
03:38:32,020 --> 03:38:34,800
Then Thursday is my re-debut.

3533
03:38:36,020 --> 03:38:38,580
But then by then October is over.

3534
03:38:40,040 --> 03:38:41,460
So, yeah.

3535
03:38:44,260 --> 03:38:46,880
I mean I guess I could still stream on Tuesday.

3536
03:38:50,860 --> 03:38:54,500
But I think I need that day to prep for my re-debut.

3537
03:38:55,000 --> 03:38:56,460
Just one last prep day.

3538
03:38:57,200 --> 03:38:57,740
I think.

3539
03:38:59,980 --> 03:39:03,740
Not that I won't do spooky games obviously after...

3540
03:39:05,120 --> 03:39:06,520
Halloween, but...

3541
03:39:06,520 --> 03:39:07,900
Just a little bit of a break.

3542
03:39:09,260 --> 03:39:09,960
Yeah.

3543
03:39:12,480 --> 03:39:12,940
We'll see.

3544
03:39:13,980 --> 03:39:15,440
Will you play the Silent Hill 2 remake?

3545
03:39:16,000 --> 03:39:18,280
I'm not sure yet.

3546
03:39:19,400 --> 03:39:21,260
I like Silent Hill.

3547
03:39:22,520 --> 03:39:24,740
I played Silent Hill 2.

3548
03:39:27,740 --> 03:39:28,220
Um...

3549
03:39:28,220 --> 03:39:30,000
But it was a long time ago.

3550
03:39:30,080 --> 03:39:33,300
I remember Silent Hill 3 more than I remember Silent Hill 2.

3551
03:39:34,800 --> 03:39:35,280
So...

3552
03:39:36,260 --> 03:39:37,300
I don't know.

3553
03:39:37,620 --> 03:39:40,580
I've seen all the great reviews about it and everything.

3554
03:39:40,980 --> 03:39:42,500
So I do still want to play it.

3555
03:39:42,520 --> 03:39:43,960
But I don't know if I want to stream it.

3556
03:39:45,120 --> 03:39:47,820
I did hear one criticism about it.

3557
03:39:49,100 --> 03:39:50,840
That it was like...

3558
03:39:50,840 --> 03:39:55,240
A little bit more action-y than...

3559
03:39:55,840 --> 03:39:58,740
Than the previous game or the original was.

3560
03:39:59,220 --> 03:40:00,840
And that like...

3561
03:40:03,720 --> 03:40:05,760
And that like...

3562
03:40:05,760 --> 03:40:08,600
There's more mannequins kind of everywhere.

3563
03:40:09,820 --> 03:40:11,580
And that just...

3564
03:40:11,580 --> 03:40:12,880
It feels like...

3565
03:40:12,880 --> 03:40:13,600
Oh my gosh.

3566
03:40:13,760 --> 03:40:15,900
IGN released this like...

3567
03:40:16,740 --> 03:40:19,860
Best 10 horror games of all time.

3568
03:40:19,860 --> 03:40:21,000
And obviously it's IGN.

3569
03:40:21,460 --> 03:40:22,220
So it's like...

3570
03:40:22,220 --> 03:40:23,320
Take it with a grain of salt.

3571
03:40:23,840 --> 03:40:25,620
Part of it is probably Rage Bait.

3572
03:40:26,480 --> 03:40:26,880
But...

3573
03:40:27,660 --> 03:40:28,280
Oh my gosh.

3574
03:40:28,380 --> 03:40:29,360
One thing they put on there.

3575
03:40:29,500 --> 03:40:32,940
Before I even was finished going through it.

3576
03:40:33,040 --> 03:40:35,600
I was like Silent Hill 2 is going to be at the top of the list.

3577
03:40:35,660 --> 03:40:36,960
I know it's going to be number one.

3578
03:40:38,240 --> 03:40:39,440
Is it all Resident Evil?

3579
03:40:39,880 --> 03:40:40,280
Almost.

3580
03:40:40,520 --> 03:40:41,200
Oh my gosh.

3581
03:40:41,340 --> 03:40:41,700
Almost.

3582
03:40:41,940 --> 03:40:44,340
Well actually they did like a fan version.

3583
03:40:44,700 --> 03:40:47,800
That was like fans get to vote for their favorite horror games.

3584
03:40:47,800 --> 03:40:50,480
And it was like top 50 fan rated horror games.

3585
03:40:50,620 --> 03:40:55,260
And probably like 25 out of 50 of them were Resident Evil games.

3586
03:40:55,300 --> 03:40:55,910
And I'm like guys...

3587
03:40:56,760 --> 03:41:01,020
Have you ever played another horror game before ever in your life?

3588
03:41:01,220 --> 03:41:01,400
Please.

3589
03:41:03,980 --> 03:41:04,560
But...

3590
03:41:04,560 --> 03:41:07,520
Alien Isolation was on the list for the most part.

3591
03:41:07,760 --> 03:41:09,940
The list wasn't so bad actually.

3592
03:41:11,340 --> 03:41:12,720
I know some people...

3593
03:41:12,720 --> 03:41:13,660
I think it was Leah...

3594
03:41:13,660 --> 03:41:14,580
No, Ashton.

3595
03:41:14,580 --> 03:41:21,620
I think Ashton was like clouding on the fact that they put Five Nights at Freddy's over Resident Evil 1.

3596
03:41:24,380 --> 03:41:24,900
But...

3597
03:41:25,580 --> 03:41:26,340
I don't know.

3598
03:41:26,560 --> 03:41:28,580
I mean Resident Evil 1...

3599
03:41:32,560 --> 03:41:36,520
But one thing I totally disagree with is having Outlast on the list.

3600
03:41:37,720 --> 03:41:40,420
Outlast is scary for the first 30 minutes.

3601
03:41:40,580 --> 03:41:43,900
And then it becomes a repetitive nothingness.

3602
03:41:44,060 --> 03:41:45,120
You just run around.

3603
03:41:45,120 --> 03:41:46,720
Oh, guys chasing after you.

3604
03:41:46,800 --> 03:41:47,440
Run, hide.

3605
03:41:47,620 --> 03:41:47,800
Okay.

3606
03:41:48,260 --> 03:41:49,040
Run, run.

3607
03:41:49,180 --> 03:41:50,200
Oh, run, shut a door.

3608
03:41:50,360 --> 03:41:51,060
Okay, you're safe.

3609
03:41:55,360 --> 03:41:55,880
So...

3610
03:41:55,880 --> 03:41:57,660
Two, thank you.

3611
03:41:58,560 --> 03:42:02,740
A wild red fox just tried to follow me into my apartment because it wanted my pizza.

3612
03:42:04,040 --> 03:42:05,420
Are you Little Misfortune?

3613
03:42:09,460 --> 03:42:11,320
What's the best horror game, Minto?

3614
03:42:12,700 --> 03:42:14,020
I'm biased though.

3615
03:42:14,580 --> 03:42:15,680
I'm actually biased.

3616
03:42:15,680 --> 03:42:18,120
Because there was also no Fatal Frame on there.

3617
03:42:18,560 --> 03:42:19,780
And I'm like, Fatal Frame is...

3618
03:42:21,000 --> 03:42:22,040
So scary.

3619
03:42:25,520 --> 03:42:26,040
Benjamin...

3620
03:42:26,560 --> 03:42:28,020
You personally hate Freddy's?

3621
03:42:28,700 --> 03:42:29,220
I...

3622
03:42:29,220 --> 03:42:31,720
I actually... I do like Five Nights at Freddy's.

3623
03:42:31,840 --> 03:42:33,620
I hate what the series has become.

3624
03:42:33,740 --> 03:42:36,680
But I think the first Five Nights at Freddy's game...

3625
03:42:37,240 --> 03:42:38,960
Is a really great horror game.

3626
03:42:39,500 --> 03:42:40,440
I stand by that.

3627
03:42:40,880 --> 03:42:41,900
I think it has...

3628
03:42:41,900 --> 03:42:46,440
You know, I love the way that they build the mystery.

3629
03:42:46,700 --> 03:42:48,440
And that it's kind of...

3630
03:42:48,440 --> 03:42:50,740
You know, not thrown in your face.

3631
03:42:50,840 --> 03:42:52,580
You're not going around reading little notes.

3632
03:42:52,580 --> 03:42:53,900
Like, it's all very subtle.

3633
03:42:55,760 --> 03:42:56,800
And I...

3634
03:42:56,800 --> 03:42:57,900
You know, you can't doubt...

3635
03:42:57,900 --> 03:42:59,020
You can't...

3636
03:43:00,300 --> 03:43:03,280
You can't ignore how influential it's been.

3637
03:43:06,460 --> 03:43:08,060
It's mostly audio logs.

3638
03:43:08,140 --> 03:43:08,520
No, no.

3639
03:43:09,340 --> 03:43:09,900
No, no.

3640
03:43:09,900 --> 03:43:13,300
It's actually, like, little posters on the back.

3641
03:43:14,020 --> 03:43:15,280
And, like, in the...

3642
03:43:15,280 --> 03:43:16,700
When you're looking at the monitors.

3643
03:43:16,920 --> 03:43:17,640
Like, you'll see...

3644
03:43:17,640 --> 03:43:19,200
You'll be, like, looking at the monitors.

3645
03:43:19,800 --> 03:43:21,740
Trying to wonder where Freddy is.

3646
03:43:21,780 --> 03:43:23,720
And you'll see a poster that's like...

3647
03:43:23,720 --> 03:43:24,740
Missing children.

3648
03:43:25,820 --> 03:43:26,580
Stuff like that.

3649
03:43:28,980 --> 03:43:29,940
It's actually...

3650
03:43:29,940 --> 03:43:30,900
It's actually...

3651
03:43:31,580 --> 03:43:33,700
I just love subtle horror like that.

3652
03:43:33,780 --> 03:43:35,000
It's like some of my favorite stuff.

3653
03:43:36,820 --> 03:43:37,300
But...

3654
03:43:37,300 --> 03:43:38,980
Another thing that was on there.

3655
03:43:39,120 --> 03:43:40,500
On the list was...

3656
03:43:40,500 --> 03:43:42,000
Slender, the eight pages.

3657
03:43:42,260 --> 03:43:43,420
Which also is like...

3658
03:43:46,460 --> 03:43:48,280
I guess I would put it on there.

3659
03:43:49,020 --> 03:43:50,820
Not as, like, a great horror game.

3660
03:43:50,900 --> 03:43:53,920
But as, again, as influential as it was.

3661
03:43:54,140 --> 03:43:54,840
I don't know.

3662
03:43:55,400 --> 03:43:57,060
I guess you kind of have to wonder...

3663
03:43:57,060 --> 03:43:58,980
It's, like, hard to, you know...

3664
03:43:58,980 --> 03:44:02,580
Do you rank them by how good of a scary game they are?

3665
03:44:02,640 --> 03:44:04,720
Or do you rank them by how, you know...

3666
03:44:04,720 --> 03:44:08,000
How much they influence the horror genre.

3667
03:44:08,560 --> 03:44:09,740
Cultural milestone.

3668
03:44:10,200 --> 03:44:11,280
Yeah, it is a classic.

3669
03:44:12,040 --> 03:44:15,360
And back then, everybody was losing their minds over it.

3670
03:44:15,460 --> 03:44:16,000
They were like...

3671
03:44:16,360 --> 03:44:18,140
Yeah, a product of it's time.

3672
03:44:18,240 --> 03:44:20,660
It's like the perfect way to describe it.

3673
03:44:21,740 --> 03:44:22,340
Yeah.

3674
03:44:22,820 --> 03:44:24,280
A product of it's time.

3675
03:44:24,400 --> 03:44:26,580
It was like, oh my gosh.

3676
03:44:26,720 --> 03:44:27,800
The horror game.

3677
03:44:28,300 --> 03:44:28,760
It was...

3678
03:44:29,420 --> 03:44:31,060
I don't want to say it was revolutionary.

3679
03:44:31,440 --> 03:44:32,340
But it was like...

3680
03:44:34,720 --> 03:44:36,260
The gameplay kind of sucks.

3681
03:44:37,060 --> 03:44:38,420
I don't want to say it sucks.

3682
03:44:38,520 --> 03:44:39,340
It's simple.

3683
03:44:40,400 --> 03:44:42,620
It's, you run around and you grab eight pages.

3684
03:44:42,880 --> 03:44:44,360
And Slenderman is chasing after you.

3685
03:44:44,620 --> 03:44:45,800
That's about it.

3686
03:44:51,410 --> 03:44:52,290
Stepping stone.

3687
03:44:52,610 --> 03:44:54,410
Another thing that was on the list was PT.

3688
03:44:54,710 --> 03:44:55,290
And I'm just like...

3689
03:44:55,290 --> 03:44:57,490
Can you really put a...

3690
03:44:58,030 --> 03:44:59,050
A non-game.

3691
03:44:59,530 --> 03:45:01,010
I mean, of course it's a game.

3692
03:45:01,110 --> 03:45:03,050
But can you put a thing that...

3693
03:45:03,810 --> 03:45:04,290
Wasn't...

3694
03:45:07,050 --> 03:45:08,370
It was just a teaser.

3695
03:45:08,690 --> 03:45:09,410
It was a demo.

3696
03:45:10,670 --> 03:45:11,790
But again.

3697
03:45:12,490 --> 03:45:18,650
It like influenced so many horror games to follow.

3698
03:45:20,330 --> 03:45:21,110
Everything...

3699
03:45:21,110 --> 03:45:24,370
For like a good solid two years after.

3700
03:45:24,930 --> 03:45:27,030
Was just hallway simulators.

3701
03:45:27,750 --> 03:45:29,070
Repeating hallways.

3702
03:45:29,570 --> 03:45:33,690
Hallways after hallways after hallways after hallways.

3703
03:45:33,990 --> 03:45:36,310
But I also, I love PT.

3704
03:45:36,310 --> 03:45:38,130
So again, I'm biased.

3705
03:45:39,170 --> 03:45:39,990
I don't know.

3706
03:45:41,670 --> 03:45:42,910
I love PT.

3707
03:45:43,810 --> 03:45:44,750
I love the talk.

3708
03:45:44,810 --> 03:45:45,170
Oh my gosh.

3709
03:45:45,170 --> 03:45:46,470
I got a TikTok yesterday.

3710
03:45:46,590 --> 03:45:50,090
That was like someone covered a sock in barbecue sauce.

3711
03:45:50,270 --> 03:45:53,170
And like put it on their hand and put it in a sink.

3712
03:45:53,390 --> 03:45:57,010
And they were like, this is the talking baby in PT.

3713
03:45:58,470 --> 03:45:59,310
This is what...

3714
03:46:04,780 --> 03:46:05,620
Good stuff.

3715
03:46:05,720 --> 03:46:06,420
Oh my gosh.

3716
03:46:06,420 --> 03:46:08,240
Sherry, thanks for the 20 gifted.

3717
03:46:09,260 --> 03:46:11,720
And Quacky, welcome to Mabu Sherry.

3718
03:46:13,380 --> 03:46:14,900
I try to...

3719
03:46:14,900 --> 03:46:17,360
As much as I dislike IGN.

3720
03:46:17,800 --> 03:46:21,300
The list, I could for the most part...

3721
03:46:22,060 --> 03:46:26,180
For the most part give them benefit of the doubt on some of the answers.

3722
03:46:26,680 --> 03:46:30,100
But obviously people are gonna disagree on some things and be like, no.

3723
03:46:30,800 --> 03:46:35,360
Resident Evil 7 was the best horror game ever made.

3724
03:46:35,360 --> 03:46:37,620
And nothing will change my mind.

3725
03:46:38,680 --> 03:46:39,780
Or whatever.

3726
03:46:41,680 --> 03:46:42,660
Game reporters.

3727
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:43,640
Am I right?

3728
03:46:46,200 --> 03:46:48,180
It's all subjective after all.

3729
03:46:48,260 --> 03:46:49,260
Yeah, pretty much.

3730
03:46:50,140 --> 03:46:52,720
They also put Dead by Daylight and Left 4 Dead on there.

3731
03:46:53,440 --> 03:46:54,000
Yeah.

3732
03:46:55,280 --> 03:46:58,040
I was very much questioning Left 4 Dead.

3733
03:46:58,320 --> 03:46:59,720
I was like...

3734
03:46:59,720 --> 03:47:02,260
Zombies does not equal a horror game.

3735
03:47:02,260 --> 03:47:05,740
But there are some spooky parts in Left 4 Dead.

3736
03:47:05,860 --> 03:47:07,300
But does spooky parts mean...

3737
03:47:07,820 --> 03:47:09,680
It's a spooky game, right?

3738
03:47:14,060 --> 03:47:16,760
Like this is action, action, action.

3739
03:47:17,160 --> 03:47:19,320
It's not horror at all.

3740
03:47:19,360 --> 03:47:21,260
Except when you anger the witch, I guess.

3741
03:47:24,620 --> 03:47:26,240
Minecraft is horror now.

3742
03:47:26,360 --> 03:47:28,580
Oh my gosh, there was a new update, wasn't it?

3743
03:47:28,600 --> 03:47:30,460
Or there's going to be a new update with like...

3744
03:47:31,330 --> 03:47:34,420
Another scary thing in the mines or something?

3745
03:47:34,540 --> 03:47:35,280
Why?

3746
03:47:35,760 --> 03:47:38,060
Why do they keep putting the scariest shit in Minecraft?

3747
03:47:39,680 --> 03:47:41,440
Less spooky zombie game.

3748
03:47:42,340 --> 03:47:43,830
Yeah, they're like...

3749
03:47:44,940 --> 03:47:50,100
Zombies, obviously that means it's of the horror variety.

3750
03:47:55,240 --> 03:47:56,020
Amnesia?

3751
03:47:56,060 --> 03:47:57,480
Amnesia was on the list.

3752
03:48:01,020 --> 03:48:04,400
And I think Soma was also on the list.

3753
03:48:06,460 --> 03:48:08,680
Was Dead Space... Dead Space was on the list.

3754
03:48:08,800 --> 03:48:09,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3755
03:48:09,700 --> 03:48:10,640
Dead Space was on the list.

3756
03:48:10,680 --> 03:48:12,220
So for the most part, that's what I'm saying.

3757
03:48:16,100 --> 03:48:17,720
I can understand it.

3758
03:48:17,900 --> 03:48:19,220
I don't agree with all of it.

3759
03:48:19,720 --> 03:48:20,880
But I understand it.

3760
03:48:23,520 --> 03:48:24,260
Soma is good.

3761
03:48:24,300 --> 03:48:25,980
I actually was going to play it this month.

3762
03:48:27,720 --> 03:48:28,520
But I...

3763
03:48:30,460 --> 03:48:31,680
I don't know why I didn't.

3764
03:48:32,580 --> 03:48:36,780
It's... I think it's because it's like more not my type of horror.

3765
03:48:38,420 --> 03:48:40,040
Like it's... Isn't it?

3766
03:48:40,080 --> 03:48:40,500
It's like...

3767
03:48:41,260 --> 03:48:42,400
How do I describe it?

3768
03:48:45,000 --> 03:48:46,900
Action but horror-y.

3769
03:48:48,400 --> 03:48:50,400
When is Minto's spooky game topless?

3770
03:48:52,120 --> 03:48:53,920
Nobody... Everybody would get mad at me.

3771
03:48:56,080 --> 03:48:57,620
Everybody would get mad at me.

3772
03:48:58,600 --> 03:48:59,720
Was Fear on the list?

3773
03:48:59,720 --> 03:49:01,720
No, it wasn't.

3774
03:49:02,580 --> 03:49:05,460
The greatest sheer terror is when you're in Minecraft.

3775
03:49:06,060 --> 03:49:08,420
Hours deep in a build and you hear a creeper noise.

3776
03:49:08,600 --> 03:49:09,140
So true.

3777
03:49:11,840 --> 03:49:15,520
You get chased a few times but the real horror is the existential dread.

3778
03:49:22,480 --> 03:49:23,260
I don't know.

3779
03:49:23,560 --> 03:49:23,980
I don't know.

3780
03:49:24,800 --> 03:49:26,360
I can get mad at you for not sharing.

3781
03:49:26,560 --> 03:49:27,180
If that helps.

3782
03:49:33,420 --> 03:49:34,340
Yeah, so...

3783
03:49:34,340 --> 03:49:37,460
I don't... I have never played Amnesia before either.

3784
03:49:37,660 --> 03:49:39,920
But it's also really not my type of game.

3785
03:49:41,600 --> 03:49:45,120
I think of the water level and I just wanna throw up.

3786
03:49:45,580 --> 03:49:46,960
I watched a friend play it.

3787
03:49:48,220 --> 03:49:49,720
I remember going to a friend's house.

3788
03:49:50,540 --> 03:49:52,640
And they owned it and they played it.

3789
03:49:52,740 --> 03:49:53,800
And I'd be like...

3790
03:49:53,800 --> 03:49:55,680
Wow, I don't wanna play this ever.

3791
03:49:57,060 --> 03:49:58,240
Thanks for the fun stream.

3792
03:49:58,380 --> 03:50:00,840
Hope we can see some Minto Fatal Frame in the future.

3793
03:50:01,000 --> 03:50:01,400
Otsumita.

3794
03:50:01,640 --> 03:50:02,320
Thanks, Rikki.

3795
03:50:02,320 --> 03:50:04,660
Yeah, I would love to do Fatal Frame.

3796
03:50:05,460 --> 03:50:06,760
Maybe Fatal Frame 2.

3797
03:50:07,900 --> 03:50:10,320
Fatal Frame 2 with maybe like...

3798
03:50:12,640 --> 03:50:15,000
It's not a CRT game.

3799
03:50:15,460 --> 03:50:19,140
But it's a game that definitely looks best when it's not in HD.

3800
03:50:19,320 --> 03:50:19,940
You know what I mean?

3801
03:50:21,120 --> 03:50:23,680
When the ghosts have that fuzz about them.

3802
03:50:24,160 --> 03:50:26,320
That like make them super duper...

3803
03:50:28,120 --> 03:50:29,400
Super duper...

3804
03:50:30,400 --> 03:50:33,000
Almost like this could be real spirit photography.

3805
03:50:37,660 --> 03:50:38,700
Run it through a filter.

3806
03:50:38,920 --> 03:50:39,760
Yeah, I think I will.

3807
03:50:39,940 --> 03:50:41,220
I have some filters I could use.

3808
03:50:42,060 --> 03:50:42,940
Some Nautica.

3809
03:50:43,240 --> 03:50:44,340
Oh my god, some Nautica.

3810
03:50:45,020 --> 03:50:46,640
If you're afraid of fish, yeah.

3811
03:50:49,900 --> 03:50:51,660
Alright guys, I'm gonna get going.

3812
03:50:51,980 --> 03:50:54,400
Thank you so much for hanging out with me.

3813
03:50:55,000 --> 03:50:56,740
And have a good night.

3814
03:50:57,220 --> 03:50:58,880
And I'm gonna go get...

3815
03:50:58,880 --> 03:50:59,820
Oh shoot, oh my gosh.

3816
03:50:59,820 --> 03:51:02,020
I just realized the time it was.

3817
03:51:02,100 --> 03:51:02,840
Oh my god!

3818
03:51:02,940 --> 03:51:03,880
Okay, I got stuff to do.

3819
03:51:04,440 --> 03:51:06,260
So, actually...

3820
03:51:06,260 --> 03:51:07,080
Hold on.

3821
03:51:07,220 --> 03:51:07,820
I wonder...

3822
03:51:09,320 --> 03:51:10,980
One second, real quick.

3823
03:51:19,190 --> 03:51:21,170
One second, real quick.

3824
03:51:24,630 --> 03:51:26,150
Oh, here we go.

3825
03:51:35,460 --> 03:51:36,300
Oh yeah.

3826
03:51:41,920 --> 03:51:46,000
Okay, nevermind.

3827
03:51:46,200 --> 03:51:47,300
Okay, anyways.

3828
03:51:48,440 --> 03:51:49,100
Hikamio!

3829
03:51:49,660 --> 03:51:50,400
Welcome to my membership.

3830
03:51:50,760 --> 03:51:51,060
Thank you!

3831
03:51:51,780 --> 03:51:52,040
Alright.

3832
03:51:52,480 --> 03:51:53,560
Otsumita everybody!

3833
03:51:54,400 --> 03:51:54,940
