And then I was like, you know, okay, one day I want to apply
to be one of the ghosts of Christmas.

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,920
What do you guys think suits me?

55
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,200
Past, present, or future?

56
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh.

57
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,360
I feel like...

58
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,740
I'm scared.

59
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,360
I think my chat would say past because they're like, you're
old.

60
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,560
But they aren't all ghosts old technically.

61
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,240
Like they all are like of the past.

62
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,480
I'm forever 19.

63
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,400
Like I don't stop.

64
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,700
I'm stuck like this.

65
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,580
Ghost of Christmas.

66
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,680
I think you're ghost of Christmas.

67
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,080
Freaky.

68
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,240
They need to add another ghost.

69
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,640
I was going to say present because your present.

70
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,520
is a present, but I mean, I think goes to Christmas Freaky.

71
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,220
I think Vicky's on to sleep.

72
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,720
Well, I can't argue that.

73
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,120
Yeah, we were also at home that, too, right?

74
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,800

We got to meet a lot of you sweet people.

76
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,020
It was the first time I've done one of those, like, wheeling
me around.

77
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,160
It was really fun.

78
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,400
Got to meet Shroud of the Hedgehog's eyes after cut.

88
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,170
Yeah, and then he said my favorite shadow line as well.

89
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,150
Yeah, it was amazing.

90
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:25,930

91
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,650
Also, I had a great time meeting you guys.

92
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,870
Try to imitate it.

93
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,410
The line.

94
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,970
Yeah, yeah.

95
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,650
Oh, no.

96
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,530
Did you record it?

97
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,490
If the world becomes my enemy, I will fight like I always
have.

98
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,610
I can't be edgy.

99
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,910
I can't be edgy.

100
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,010
I love Latinos.

101
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,810
I mean, I could have asked for that line.

102
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,550
Oh, it was so great.

103
00:10:52,850 --> 00:11:02,090
enjoyed it very much and then yeah i've been i i i've either
created the best or the worst thing ever by combining a very

104
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:09,890
typical british dish which is like this the cremas the
cremas leftovers it's called bubble and squeak you guys have

105
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:17,490
ever heard of bubble bubble and squeak yeah bubble and
squeak it's like that's so cute you mash up all of the roast

106
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:25,410
potatoes the vegetables and stuff and then you make a
pancake out of it Anyway, I made the pancake and I was like

107
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,170
frying the pancake and I was like, this looks like
something.

108
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,730
This looks like Okonomiyaki.

109
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,290
And I was like, what if I put Okonomiyaki sauce and Kupi
mayonnaise on it?

110
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:43,810
And it was one of those moments I was like, big brain, all
the equations, the meme.

111
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,270
And I was like, wow, I've created something truly innovative
here.

112
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,150
So I'll have to make it.

113
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,810
It was so peem.

114
00:11:52,110 --> 00:12:01,510
so oh my god wait that reminds me vicky when i i went to
disney after holiday matzari oh yeah i was i was at epcot

115
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:09,330
and um our group of friends we were really hungry and like
all the restaurants were booked for a long time except the

116
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:16,650
british food and so we went to epcot to eat british food

117
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,290
But everyone else got the bangers and mash.

118
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,370
Bangers and mash.

119
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,370
Oh.

120
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,910
I love what that says about British cuisine, though.

121
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,090
Cues for everything apart from the British restaurant.

122
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,190
Yeah, but it's awesome because we were able to eat.

123
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,510
I mean, what did you think of it?

124
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,570
Did you think it was nice or were you just happy to eat
something?

125
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,310
Yeah.

126
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,090
Yeah.

127
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,570
Actually, everybody who got the bangers and mash, we're
like, this is really good.

128
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,350
Oh, wait, what is a banger?

129
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:58,610
A banger?

130
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,350
Something mashed is mashed potatoes?

131
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,410
Yeah.

132
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,950
Yeah.

133
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:02,990
A banger is a sausage.

134
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:03,810
Yeah.

135
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,490
So it's like sausage mash and a ton of gravy.

136
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,890
Hopefully they had a ton of gravy.

137
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,870
I hardly even know her.

138
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,910
Oh, that actually worked.

139
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,250
It worked.

140
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,310
Do you guys say a bang as a slang?

141
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:21,750
No?

142
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,910
You don't?

143
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,270
Maybe that's why?

144
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,250
Is that kind of why?

145
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,690
Is that kind of why?

146
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,270

I'm ready.

176
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:31,960
Okay.

177
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,920
Here we go.

178
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,640
You ready?

179
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,080
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

180
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,820
Number one.

181
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,780
Group question.

182
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,100
From each of you regarding the other two.

183
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,600
What is a song you'd like to hear them perform?

184
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,900
This could be individually or as a duet.

185
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,100
Ooh.

186
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,460
Oh, like each person, not as a group.

187
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:03,220
i think it's like each person like what do you want to hear
them sing oh that's hard

188
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:19,930
okay i think i can go okay so i was thinking with i want to

190
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:32,050
kiari tunes i think now really cute and you could do the
dance as well.

191
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,150
What's a favorite Kiari tune?

192
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,310
Yeah, what is your favorite?

193
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,390
Oh, that's so hard.

194
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,850
I like that one.

195
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,850
I think it would sound cute.

196
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:57,130
And for Minto, I want to hear you sing some like some James
Bond, some the world is not enough.

197
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,410
Like some very like jazzy like Like, mmm, damn, kind of bond
tunes.

198
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,310
I think that would be pretty cool.

199
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,750
Try it.

200
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,870
I'll try it.

201
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,910
What about you guys?

202
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,690
I'm, like, digging into my brain of music.

203
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,750
Because, like, my...

204
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,430
Go ahead.

205
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,290
I'm too Macross-pilled.

206
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,950
I'm trying to think of things that aren't Macross right now.

207
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,890
I was literally...

208
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,330
Oh, my gosh.

209
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,270
I was like, I want to hear Phoebe sing Macross.

210
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,550
I was like, but that's because you already sing it.

211
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,490
And so I'm like, I said, I'm like, oh, yeah, we're macros.

212
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,390
I mean, there's a lot of macros songs, though.

213
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:44,810
So, specifically, you could say a specific song for macros.

214
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,890
I will sing it, probably.

215
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,430
Wait, oh, oh, gosh, what's that?

216
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,190
Digging into the internal jukebox, like, oh, what was that?

217
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:53,850
What was that song?

218
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,270
I think Phoebe's voice would suit Okazan.

219
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,210
Okazaki Ritzko's like songs really well like fruits basket.

220
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,030
Okazaki Ritzko stuff.

221
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:12,330
Yeah, I think your voice suits that, you know, like, oh my
gosh, the Princess Tutu opening and stuff like that.

222
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,010
Oh my gosh, I love, I love that.

223
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,730
There's an ending, there's an ending song to Princess Tutu
that's by Okazaki Ritzko.

224
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,410
And I do a strange dance to it whenever I hear it.

225
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,490
I get on the ground.

226
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,090
I want to see this.

227
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,350
Oh.

228
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:28,770
Yeah.

229
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,690
And I worm on the ground.

230
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,370
I don't know why.

231
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,990
But my...

232
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,790
Can you imagine it?

233
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,850
Just imagine a shrimp on the ground.

234
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,550
Like you're doing the worm or you're kind of squirming.

235
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,910
You're squirming.

236
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,890
Just on its side.

237
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,430
Imagine a shrimp on its side on the ground.

238
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,590
And then it's just kind of like contracting and
uncontracting.

239
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,010
Do you know just like...

240
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,050
I don't know.

241
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:58,730
Yeah.

242
00:18:59,390 --> 00:18:59,830
Yeah.

243
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,610
Is this the dance movie you bring out at the Christmas
parties?

244
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,110
Specifically only for the ending song The Princess Tutu.

245
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,830
So this is something you've been doing.

246
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,890
Is this like...

247
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:11,830
Like...

248
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,430
It is!

249
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:17,690
I started listening, I started watching Princess Tutu
finally because I read the manga as a kid.

250
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,150
And then I was like, ooh, I'm feeling, I'm feeling on the
beat for this.

251
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,210
It's just a little, it's a slight little bossa nova kind of
beat.

252
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,890
It's really sweet, it's really cute.

253
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,550
I started shrimping on the ground.

254
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:35,570
like squirming on the ground and I was like this is my dance
for this specific song now it's like a it's like a physical

255
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:50,570
stimming like it is a fascinating party trick I want to see
it imagine it in 3d like 3d concert so you say you do this

256
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:56,030
regularly like how many times a week would you say how many
episodes of

257
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,730
Look at penis position, yeah, yeah.

258
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,670
Okay, wait, so this is a new recent, like, kind of, because
you said you just, like, started.

259
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:15,570
No, no, when I watched Princess Tutu, like, maybe, like,
three, two, three years ago for the first time, I don't skip

260
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,310
the opening or the ending song for anime when I watch it.

261
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:18,930
I don't.

262
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:26,590
So every time I got to the ending of an episode, and the
song came on, I started really feeling it, and so I just

263
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,570
shrimped on the ground.

264
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,510
She could get unlocked.

265
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,990
Phoebe, does anyone know this?

266
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,830
Is this, like, the first time you're explaining this to
anybody?

267
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,730
This is the first time I'm ever telling this story.

268
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,330
I'm sure.

269
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,930
So every 23 minutes or so, if you're binging, yeah, exactly.

270
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:45,730
I was binging.

271
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:56,230
Phoebe, can you make a promise to us when, when, if in the
future we ever get to do something in 3D, can you teach us?

272
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,650
Oh, yeah.

273
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,330
I can.

274
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,510
I can.

275
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,450
You know what it reminds me of in terms of Chica Gay and
stuff?

276
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,190
Is it like Gundam Epion?

277
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,630
Just a little bit.

278
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,130
It's like, it's a little bit like that.

279
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,430
Okay, I think I get it.

280
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,490
Yeah, you kind of get, but like, but like on your side, on
the floor.

281
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,770
Okay, I get it, I get it.

282
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,710
I don't, the thing is, is I don't remember the ending.

283
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,410
I remember the opening song, but I don't remember the ending
song at all.

284
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,590
So I can't imagine the song at all for YouTube.

285
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,610
That's a...

286
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,650
Yeah, I mean...

287
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,630
I'll link it so you guys can listen to it later on.

288
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,770
It's not the kind of song that...

289
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,550
You're gonna be like, what?

290
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,210
You were shrimpin' on the ground to this song?

291
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,990
I'm listening to it right now.

292
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,350
I'm gonna listen to it right now.

293
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,210
I'm very intrigued to listen to it after this.

294
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,070
Yes.

295
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,650
Well, okay, Walla!

296
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:01,130
Anyway, the songs I think you guys should sing?

297
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,650
Or Vince didn't get to say what song she thinks Vicky should
sing.

298
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:05,870
Oh, sorry.

299
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:14,570
For Vicky, I want to hear either The Beatles because I think
it would be really cute because you're both British.

300
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,170
But also, Evanescence.

301
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,910
I love Evanescence!

302
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,270
Wait, Minko, will you do, though?

303
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,350
Wake me up!

304
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:32,930
for me oh yeah i'll do i'll do it for you i'll do it wake me
up wake me up you could you could both do that wake me up

305
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:43,010
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so good i'm excited i love the
beatles my my dad my dad would always play the beatles so i

306
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:52,090
grew up on the beatles yeah so i can i can sing any beatles
for you yeah oh that'd be wonderful You know what, that's a,

307
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,210
that's a, I can hear Vicky's voice singing the Beatles.

308
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,430
Yeah, yeah, right, right.

309
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,230
Ah, thanks, guys.

310
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,010
What about you, Febe?

311
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:11,170
I think, okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna think duets this time,
because there are so many songs that I've been wanting to

312
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,850
sing with you guys, trills and duets.

313
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:20,250
But like, with Vicky, I would really like to duet a, like,
Takarazuka-style song together.

314
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,570
I'm so down.

315
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,810
Because I know we both really like the Takoratsuka Theater.

316
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:37,450
And also, like, the way that we split songs already between
the three of us is, like, Vicky does the alto part.

317
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,190
And then I do the first soprano part.

318
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,830
So it feels very, like...

319
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,230
Yeah!

320
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,970
Like we could do a lot of, like, high-low duets together.

321
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:45,370
Yeah!

322
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:49,650
So, like, kind of, like, review Starlight stuff.

323
00:23:51,610 --> 00:24:00,170
yeah that'd be so good or any any of the takorazuka songs
when it's like the the main male and female parts do the

324
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:12,010
duet together you know romantic duet we could definitely do
those yeah i would love to that sounds so nice and then with

325
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:20,930
uh with mint oh god there's also a lot of songs that i
wanted to do together as well but um i i feel like Because

326
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,090
we both, like, grew up liking Macross Frontier a lot.

327
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:31,530
So, definitely some Macross songs together, I think.

328
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,210
I mean, with both of you, too.

329
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:37,210
Because I ended up going to a Macross concert with Vicky
earlier this year as well.

330
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:43,070
And I feel like there's a lot of Macross duets and group
songs that we could do together.

331
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,590
But also, like, jazz stuff.

332
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,930
We really like jazz.

333
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,670
I'm trying to think of...

334
00:24:50,690 --> 00:25:00,570
trying to think of like jazzy duets or we could just do
class like classic things like a magnet or something not the

335
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:06,410
magnet i would still do harmonies yeah pull out pull out the
magnet i don't think i've heard a serious magnet cover in a

336
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:14,290
very very very long time yeah it's kind of got a reputation
now wait vicky how'd you get my i don't know why do i have

337
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:20,390
your can i is this something i can fix wait wait hold on let

338
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,510

Oh, it's got sticky.

341
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,530
I'm so sorry.

342
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,250
Why is it floating?

343
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,850
What is it floating?

344
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,650
Now you're eating it.

345
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:35,890
I took it.

346
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:38,990
All right.

347
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:39,910
Anyway, carry on.

348
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,530
I got distracted.

349
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:42,250
Okay.

350
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,990
Well, that's nice.

351
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,750
Maybe it's cold outside.

352
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,010
We got a...

353
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,850
Baby, it's cold outside.

354
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,570
Oh, you ready for question two?

355
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,210
Yeah.

356
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,730
Day two of the Advent.

357
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,290
Minto question.

358
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:05,530
If you had a collab meal with McDonald's, what would it
have?

359
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,590
Collab meal with McDonald's.

360
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,910
Well, I would think.

361
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,390
I think I would make it my...

362
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,450
The only thing that I order at McDonald's if I ever go

363
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:31,210
with ketchup and pickle and that's that's what it would be I
mean that sounds good only has ketchup and pickle on top of

364
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:44,530
the meat only ketchup and pickle wait that's your normal
order yep not even the free smile there's a free smile yeah

365
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:55,170
you can order a smile that's still a thing at least you used
to be able to order a smile yeah what yeah be like i demand

366
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:06,110
that you smile at me right now i can give i imagine them
like browning and then giving you a little like a yes like a

367
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:18,770

368
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,950
guys only Oh, they're on there.

369
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,390
That's where I heard it from.

370
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,370
Okay, my collab would be only smiles.

371
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,790
Only smiles.

372
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,040
And it's not free.

373
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,720
Oh, I like that.

374
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,660
Yeah.

375
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,280
I mean, I'd still order it.

376
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,120
Hopefully you're not hungry though.

377
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:53,200
If it came with some like, I don't know, Minto toy, I'd
still, I'd still pay for all smiles.

378
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:07,600
why not yeah a little squeezy toy or so yeah all right
question three group if nvp ended up on stranded on a

379
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,660
deserted island who would resort to cannibalism first

380
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:26,500
i don't want to alarm you guys i've been playing a lot of
games with cannibalism in it lately so really my brain i'm

381
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,500
not i'm not opposed to the idea because i'm desensitized

382
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:55,460
oh defining as cannibalism like a cheeky finger a cheeky
finger what about a cheeky cheek a cheeky i bet the rough is

383
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:05,560
really delicious no i mean there's meat on my rump for days
if we need I will give up my rump if you have just a little

384
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:13,120
bit of it it'll grow back surely you know it'll scab over
and grow back I'm sure it'd be fine I think that would be

385
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:26,360
fine if it's for you guys to survive I will give up my cake
for you guys oh I will have a flat cake for the rest of my

386
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:36,420
life to feed you guys okay so we will always survive three
cakes isn't that crazy three cakes wait you can have your

387
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:47,880
cake and eat it too yeah that didn't answer the question
though who would resort to it first oh who would actually

388
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:55,860
eat the said thing i feel like i feel like we would all want
okay correct me if i'm wrong if it was me i would want us

389
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:02,360
all to survive so i'd be willing to share some fingers or a
cheeky cheek with you guys.

390
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,640
I definitely think fingers should be like the last to go.

391
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,240
Oh, really?

392
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,340
Because they're important.

393
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,340
Yeah, you need them for gripping.

394
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,460
Oh, yeah, it's true.

395
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,240
What kind of need you don't use?

396
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,600
It's probably fine.

397
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,460
Do you need toes?

398
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,200
We need those for gripping too.

399
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,540
Do you do?

400
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:23,680
Do you?

401
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,260
I grip with my toes.

402
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:32,220
Oh, yeah, we had this call conversation before the show yeah
we talked about this before

403
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:46,170
all right i think maybe your your i don't know maybe the
cake is the least important part maybe i mean what what are

404
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:53,230
you using it for other than to twerk i mean it would be sad
not to twerk anymore but i think i could deal with it you

405
00:30:53,230 --> 00:31:01,370
know that's that's her favorite activity vicky roman i don't
know how to out of the club, twerking it away.

406
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:12,550
Anyway, I think, who would add, right, I think based on what
Minto said, maybe Minto would do it first.

407
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,490
I think so.

408
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:13,990
Probably.

409
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,990
I think it would be a great opportunity for me to have an
excuse to try.

410
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:18,970
Okay!

411
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,950
I guess you're, like, bacon.

412
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,310
Anyway, go ahead.

413
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,730
Question four.

414
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:26,830
Four.

415
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,610
What have we got?

416
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,550
Phoebe.

417
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,310
All right.

418
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:34,150
Right, now that she's next to you, how do you feel about
mint-flavored foods?

419
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,270
Now that she's next to me...

420
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,450
Oh, cannibalism...

421
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,450
Wait, maybe Phoebe's the first one to cannibalize.

422
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,230
Yeah, maybe!

423
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:42,930
Maybe!

424
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,770
Oh, look, think about this, though.

425
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,230
Your hands were in front of my face earlier, and I went for
the candy cane instead.

426
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,750
Oh, that's so rude.

427
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,870
That's true, that's true.

428
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,790
I could have...

429
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,990
I could have done a little bit of finger-sucking, but I did
not.

430
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,310
I... I... You know, I just ate the candy cane.

431
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:02,270
candy can like a normal, non-cannibal human being.

432
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,690
Baby, baby, not on stream.

433
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,030
Yeah.

434
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,470
I can't know.

435
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:05,830
You can't do that.

436
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,250
I can't know.

437
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:06,990
No, no, no.

438
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:07,830
No, no.

439
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,390
Yeah, right.

440
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,850
Okay.

441
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:13,590
Oh, oh, oh.

442
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,170
Mint flavored foods.

443
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,270
Oh, good.

444
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:23,170
Oh, we had a, we had a whole incident earlier today where my
housemate made chocolate cookies but didn't tell anybody she

445
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,390
put peppermint in it.

446
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,110
Oh, and, uh, what happened?

447
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,750
Well, people complained, and then I ended up eating all the
cookies.

448
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:39,970
So, I guess I'm, you know what, I, I'm almost more inclined
to eat mint flavored foods because then I miss her.

449
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,830
And then it feels like she's, you know, it feels like she's,
she's with me.

450
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:45,890
You're part of me?

451
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,670
I don't know which, but you eat me, I'm gone.

452
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,930
And then this like absence makes the heart grow fonder.

453
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,010
Exactly.

454
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,110
Yeah.

455
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,350
And then eat mint foods again.

456
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,070
And then it's a endless cycle.

457
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:02,790
Yeah.

458
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:03,810
And the cycle.

459
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,550
And it makes you feel like your breath is fresh even when
it's not, you know?

460
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:12,130
I'm in your heart as me and as the cholesterol.

461
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,550
And as the cholesterol.

462
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:15,750
How romantic.

463
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,010
So, yes, I almost like them more now because of her.

464
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:20,850
Ah.

465
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,370
So that means you didn't like it originally.

466
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,970
Is that what you're saying?

467
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,570
Stir in the pot.

468
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,430
I so like.

469
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,790
I also...

470
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,330
So, when it came to...

471
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,550
No, I didn't like a lot of mint-flavored food, actually.

472
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:42,270
But when it came to mint chocolate chip ice cream, I like
the burn of the mint with the crunchiness of the chocolate

473
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:42,510
chip.

474
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,710
You know, it's the perfect flavor for it.

475
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,510
You just want to feel something.

476
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,310
Yeah, no, you just want to feel something.

477
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:50,450
So true.

478
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:50,950
Oh, my gosh.

479
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,030
People make fun of me, but I like to have a...

480
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,430
When I have a mask on, I like to eat a cough drop.

481
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:00,030
And then I like to have the burn of the cough drop go into
my eyes.

482
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,210
you really feel something.

483
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,310
Wait, that's not a big brain.

484
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,950
I'm going to try that next time.

485
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:06,590
Really?

486
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,450
Yeah, yeah.

487
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,750
It's like just really feels like something.

488
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,590
Sometimes you just want to feel something.

489
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,670
Is it like extra effective as well?

490
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,570
Because it's entering via your throat and via your eyes at
the same time.

491
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:18,210
Maybe.

492
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,950
Maybe that's why it feels good.

493
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:20,370
Maybe.

494
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,690
I'm going to have to try it, I think.

495
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:24,910
Question 5.

496
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,230
My suggestion for everybody.

497
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:26,890
5.

498
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:27,410
Do it.

499
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,190
Five.

500
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,530
Here we go.

501
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:30,710
Question 5.

502
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,910
of the advent.

503
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,330
Hi Densetsu, for the ultimate vibe test.

504
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,110
I was wondering, what's your boba orders?

505
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:40,490
Oh.

506
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,010
Okay, first question.

507
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,710
Do you guys actually drink boba on a regular basis?

508
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,010
I do.

509
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:46,710
Okay.

510
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:47,510
Yes.

511
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:48,730
Do you?

512
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,770
Very occasionally, I'll be honest.

513
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,950
Not super often.

514
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:57,490
I'm actually not that big on tapioca.

515
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,770
I know a lot of people like that.

516
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:10,550
though yeah i love them balls that's okay though did i fail
vibe check chat now for me i like i like the fruity popping

517
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:16,670
things like fruity popping light yeah i don't know any of
that kind of thing yeah it does count it counts yeah and

518
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:26,630
some black tea lovely what about you guys so i have like a
local place yeah i have a local place so i can't they have

519
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:35,130
like a special order that i get so i can't say but but if i
go it depends i have two orders if i'm in a fruity mood i

520
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:42,090
like anything like a raspberry kind of tea or something i'll
get that and if i'm in a milky mood i'll get anything that's

521
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:46,030
like an oreo oh that sounds so good

522
00:35:49,990 --> 00:36:00,110
i uh i'm very basic i like brown sugar boba milk tea like
honestly kind of like vicky i don't I don't care too much

523
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,770
for Boba.

524
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,450
Like, Boba pearls themselves.

525
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,750
Like, I'll have them if they're there.

526
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,790
But what I really like is a good tea.

527
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,650
So if the tea is yummy, then that's what matters to me.

528
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,090
And then if they have, like, a cream.

529
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:15,270
Because, like, in California, we have, like, a chain called
Happy Lemon.

530
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,510
And they have, like, a puff cream.

531
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,690
It's just, like, a super-y-y cream kind of thing.

532
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,010
I like getting cream on that.

533
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,390
Just sugar and cream.

534
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,770
I'm, like, it's, like, a child's order.

535
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,390
But that's what I like, basically.

536
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:35,810
the boba in it usually because it's like slightly sweetened
and so i'll get my tea zero percent or 25 percent sugar and

537
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:43,210
then the boba sweetens the rest so it's pretty nice oh
you're so adult you're so grown up about it am i like you

538
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:49,270
want reduced they're like we recommend the reduced 80
percent sugar and i'm like give me the full sugar give it to

539
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:56,730
me no i'm with mint though in this one i don't i don't like
tea that's too sugary well it's like with regular tea as

540
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,530
well i don't put sugar in Me too, yeah.

541
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,890
And a bit of milk, that's all you need, you know what I'm
saying?

542
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,330
I agree.

543
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,610
Do you have sugar in normal tea, Phoebe, like, in a black
tea, hot black tea?

544
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,670
Do you have sugar in there?

545
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,170
I put, well, I have a lot of honey in my teas just because
it's good for your guilt.

546
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,090
No, honey.

547
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:25,050
But yeah, I will, during my barista arc, I did put lots of
cream and sugar in my hot drinks.

548
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,670
Oh.

549
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,350
A long drink.

550
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:33,110
You don't need any more sweetness because you're already
plenty sweet.

551
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:34,610
Yeah.

552
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:35,450
Mew.

553
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,450
Question six.

554
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:49,350
Vicky, you are so productive and on that grind set
constantly, what are your top tips to stay focused and...

555
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,450
What are you saying?

556
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,770
Okay, this is something very specific to me, and I know you
guys might have an opinion.

557
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,790
I cannot stand the word EP.

558
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,350
Oh, yeah.

559
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,310
Listen, just say sleepy.

560
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:10,790
Why do you need to take the letters of the word?

561
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,190
I thought you were complimenting me, whoever sent this in.

562
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,910
Clearly, you're trying to get me to say the word that I
hate.

563
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,550
She got rage-bidden, Phoebe.

564
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:21,490

565
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,670

566
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:23,890
Oh, she got one guy.

567
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,090
Oh, one guy.

568
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:25,990

passionate hatred no vicky has given me the ep pass before

570
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:45,230

577
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:21,410
If Santa came down my chimney, took his cookie and said, I'm
Eepie, then I'd kick his butt straight back out of the

578
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:21,770
chimney.

00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,060
Okay.

673
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:48,000
I think we just, if we spend too long thinking about it,
we'll be here ages because I'm sure there's lots of things

674
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,420
that we want to say to each other.

675
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,360
But I'm just gonna go ahead and do it.

676
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,360
Okay, Minto.

677
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,420
I'm just gonna say what comes to my head.

678
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:05,540
Minto, I love how you're so passionate about your hobbies
and that you will do anything and go anywhere for the things

679
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,580
that you love.

680
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,380
I love that about you.

681
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,120
Yeah, I love that about you.

682
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:20,060
Phoebe, I love that you're genuinely so kind to everyone and
just such a pure, beautiful soul.

683
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,180
I think that's very sweet.

684
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,140
Yeah, all right, you guys say some things.

685
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,440
Well, I think some more.

686
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:26,800
Thank you.

687
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,800
Thank you.

688
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,320
Yeah.

689
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,280
You, you work so hard.

690
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:40,840
this applies to like this group in general but you work so
hard and you've never ever given up on your dreams you've

691
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:48,300
always found a way forward and i think that despite all
everything you've managed to still not just give up on your

692
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:55,560
dreams but you haven't given up on being a good person too
all the while oh that's something truly beautiful about you

693
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:02,880
i think that's the thing about like all of us really i think
that's the basis of gen zetsu right yeah i think so i think

694
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,540
so It's kind of the uniting thing.

695
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,640
Yeah, I think so.

696
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,480
And also that we're big fat nerds.

697
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,380
I love that you guys are nerds.

698
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,560
No, but I love that.

699
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,520
I do like that.

700
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:25,760
I do love that we all have our very specific interests and
we're all like very fun together.

701

We all like to joke and we have good humor together.

702
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,960
I love that about us.

703
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:38,600
so i feel like we're all like different flavors of nerd you
know what i mean yeah like how we come together in this

704
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:54,840
beautiful casserole of nerdiness okay oh yeah another thing
okay so this is phoebe and then i'll say another minto one i

much fun just like sitting there with a cuppa listening to i

713
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:09,810

like not storytelling because it's stuff that actually

714
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:15,730
happened but like you know i mean the way you tell stuff is
like so intriguing it just makes me want to watch you

723
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,170
Yes!

724
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:29,790
I know what I mean, right Vicky?

725
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:30,570
I am free!

726
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:38,550
No, it's like, I want to, I want to live like that because I
think that is the most, like, that is the most satisfying

727
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:47,410
and happy and like human way of living is just to have such
a free spirit and to just let your, let your love and your

728
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:49,650
passion and your feelings run wild.

729
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:55,210
And that's how you're able to do stuff like, like your, like
your lore video during your debut recently with the, with

730
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:55,650
the freaking.

731
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:56,750
Kiku on.

732
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:02,870
And it's all these creative ideas that spawn in your brain.

733
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,530
And all of the silly little moments, too.

734
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:06,410
Like, it's pain.

735
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:07,530
You know?

736
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:11,370
Spawns from your spirit being free.

737
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,430
I don't know if that's what that was.

738
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:14,970
I think it is.

739
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:15,390
No, it is.

740
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:16,410
I think I'm just stupid.

741
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:18,410
No, no, no, no.

742
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:19,910
I know exactly what Phoebe means.

743
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:27,490
It's hard to explain in words, but you have that kind of,
yeah, Like, that's just, that's Minto, you know?

744
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,710
You've got that beautiful shining spirit.

745
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:31,390
Unapologetically you.

746
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:31,850
Yeah.

747
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,870
I don't know how to be anybody else.

748
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:35,770
I love it.

749
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:36,710
I love that.

750
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:37,810
Oh, you guys.

751
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:39,250
I love you guys.

752
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,490
I love you guys.

753
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:45,850
I think we had a shared thing as well, so that's probably
around three.

754
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:50,690
I feel like we all feel warm and fuzzy inside, so.

755
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:54,250
There's more we could say, but we would yet forever on one
question.

756
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:54,710
Yeah.

757
00:51:54,990 --> 00:52:03,150
And we're on the question 10 Over the calendar, guys
Do-do-do-do-do Do-do-do-do Group.

758
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:04,770
Who's the mommy?

759
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,910
Who's the dad?

760
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,390
Very different energy This question.

761
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:08,110
Who's the mommy?

762
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:08,970
Who's the daddy?

763
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:09,910
Who's the baby?

764
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,690
Well, I think we know who the baby is

765
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,810
Who pray tell?

766
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:17,930
Who pray tell?

767
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:18,710
No, Phoebe baby.

768
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:20,670
Phoebe baby.

769
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:21,750
Phoebe baby.

770
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,050
I don't know.

771
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,270
I have a beard on, so I think maybe Maybe you're the daddy.

772
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:26,990
I'm the mommy.

773
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,650
Actually, I think mental...

774
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:29,850
I think this is pretty accurate.

775
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,130
I think mental is daddy.

776
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,170
Yeah, I think...

777
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:35,010
To be honest, I think probably that is true.

778
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,730
And then I'm the... I'm the mom, I guess.

779
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:38,150
Yeah.

780
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:41,450
You have very nurturing vibes.

781
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:43,330
Yeah, you do, yeah.

782
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:44,910
And the one who's, like...

783
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:49,070
The one who's actually, like, on top of doing all, like, the
taxes and the, like, account...

784
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,050
The bookkeeping and stuff behind the scenes.

785
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:52,170
And then there's daddy.

786
00:52:52,170 --> 00:53:05,790
Daddy goes and it goes to work and I do actually file my own
taxes LaMau no way I file them too but I don't know if I do

787
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:13,110
them the right way or not no you do Phoebe say you do I'm
sure you do Phoebe you do I do I do them correctly I do I do

788
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:23,850
them correctly I do baby baby baby no you do it just fine
don't worry baby it's okay baby no tax those taxes for sure

789
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:37,890
yeah that was surprisingly easy to i think so actually yeah
i think so all right then straight to question 11.

790
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:41,910
11.

791
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:49,270
phoebe this question for phoebe i just wanted to say i'm so
so excited for you i've been following your journey as an

792
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:55,550
idol and to see you blossom in this group with two amazing
partners in crime is truly beautiful sorry that's not a

793
00:53:55,550 --> 00:54:06,030
question i wanted to ask what you're most excited to do with
mint and vicky oh very sweet most excited well first of all

794
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:12,870
that's very very sweet thank you i want to blossom more and
make everyone proud you guys and also mint and vicky i want

795
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:20,070
to make everyone proud but also what i'm most excited i mean
there's That's hard because there's a lot of things to be

796
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:20,990
excited about.

797
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:27,630
But I think I've personally always really, really enjoyed
making original music.

798
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:33,430
That's like one of my favorite parts of doing music stuff
and idol stuff.

799
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:38,630
And I feel like there's a lot of things that I've always
wanted to say personally via my music.

800
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:42,210
But what about the things that the three of us can say
together?

801
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:47,090
The experiences that we have shared, the experiences that we
all relate to.

802
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:50,090
and the things that we want to convey to you guys.

803
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,030
So I'm excited to see what kind of music is born from it.

804
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:55,410
I mean, like, Densetsu MVPs was really awesome.

805
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:57,450
We also made that in, like, two weeks.

806
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:59,850
So, like, what are we going to also be made?

807
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:01,470
Anita's not crazy, bro.

808
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:02,530
Oh, my God.

809
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:03,490
I know.

810
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:05,230
Absolutely.

811
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:06,990
So amazing.

812
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:08,730
Yeah.

813
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:14,830
Given more time to cook in the kitchen, though, I wonder
what kinds of, like, crazy stuff we'll come up with and what

814
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:17,170
kinds of feelings we'll want to put into our music.

815
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:20,210
So that probably is what I'm most excited for.

816
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:23,630
I'm so excited for that too!

817
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:24,630
Me too!

818
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,990
I'm excited to do the shrimp.

819
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:30,170
I'm excited to be taught the shrimp dance by Phoebe in 3D.

820
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:30,970
I gotta learn.

821
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:31,470
In 3D.

822
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:35,090
We're gonna have to get a top down camera.

823
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:38,890
The camera's not the pan to the top and it's gonna show us
wiggling on the grass.

824
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:43,810
You know how like sometimes like people with like when they
do 3D streams, when they're like transitioning, they have

825
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:46,010
like an eye catch or something that's like loading.

826
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:55,230
all of us like kind of in a circle like on the ground doing
the shrimp it's gonna be some kind it's gonna look like some

827
00:55:55,230 --> 00:56:10,870
kind of demonic ritual but I promise it's very fun and cute
yes it's gonna be so good yes all right question 12 do do do

828
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:20,550
do do do group did you know each other before the dead and
said to project if not how did you react to vicky being

829
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:32,370

huh what do you mean honestly it was like kind of a crazy

830
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:40,650
shock it was like i've never met a british person before and
so i i just didn't expect her to be british i just i thought

831
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:50,330
i thought there were only myths and fairy tales and so on
Well, for me, I had Steiner as a manager for a long while.

832
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:54,510
But then when I met Vicky, I was like, Oh my God, there's
more of this.

833
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:56,490
Right.

834
00:56:58,810 --> 00:56:59,410
Yep.

835
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:00,190
Yeah.

836
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,810
And then she just started saying things like Kappa.

837
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:04,290
And...

838
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:06,970
And...

839
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:14,850
I feel really honored that the Queen's people is...

840
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:15,630
Sorry.

841
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:18,030
Yeah.

842
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:18,490
Yeah.

843
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:20,330
We have royalty.

844
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,890
We're learning so much like cultural exchange.

845
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:24,990
Yeah, royalty in our group.

846
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:25,410
Yeah.

847
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:26,390
Exactly.

848
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:27,530
What a queen.

849
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:28,230
Thanks.

850
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:29,390
Thanks, guys.

851
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:33,950
Well, I mean, the good thing about the answers is that they
were positive.

852
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,950
They didn't say anything negative.

853
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,850
So that's good, right, chat?

854
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:38,690
Yeah.

855
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:41,030
You know, thinking British people are myths.

856
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:44,130
There's only like, I don't know, five of them or something.

857
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,850
I mean, like unicorns are like that too, right?

858
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:47,790
I love cryptids.

859
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:48,930
Yeah.

860
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:49,950
Yeah.

861
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:50,310
Yeah.

862
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:51,290
British people.

863
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:52,330
The, yeah.

864
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:53,530
Yeah.

865
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:53,850
Yeah.

866
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:54,050
Okay.

867
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:54,850
Cool.

868
00:57:56,190 --> 00:58:01,810
We're just, we're just made up myths that don't exist.

869
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:04,210
That's what people think of me.

870
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,110
I've seen this in Harry Potter before.

871
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:06,850
Isn't that creepy?

872
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,210
Oh yeah.

873
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:08,190
Oh my gosh.

874
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:09,130
Whoa.

875
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:09,990
They're real.

876
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:17,010
I thought it was just Hollywood special effects that they
put a filter on their voice.

877
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:24,650
Yeah, guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to turn the filter off now.

878
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:28,290
To the true Vicky Roman, this is the real one.

879
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:31,590
I'm going to have some sweet tea on the sweet Christmas.

880
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:32,050
Oh, my dream.

881
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:33,930
My dream's crushed.

882
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:34,730
Oh, no.

883
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:36,110
I'm so sorry.

884
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:39,250
I've been using a voice filler up until now.

885
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:40,390
I'm so sorry.

886
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:41,370
Oh, my gosh.

887
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:42,970
I had my suspicions.

888
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:43,950
Oh, yeah.

889
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:45,610
Oh, my gosh.

890
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,010
Yeah, you know, we've got to guess.

891
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:50,230
some barbecue now that I've got my true voice back.

892
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:50,510
Barbecue.

893
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:54,770
Wait, what accent are you trying to...

894
00:58:54,770 --> 00:59:01,690
Right, anyway, let's expeliamus into the next question,
shall we?

895
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:03,370
13!

896
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,890
Vicky, if...

897
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:07,870
Oh my...

898
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:09,810
What are all these cursed questions for me?

899
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:18,150
If Vicky and Mint were dangling over a lava-filled volcano,
and the villain who captured them said, a durian and i'll

900
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:31,470
free them what would you do what right can i give some
context okay can i give some context genuinely okay i i've

901
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:38,890
had fresh durian okay i had some fresh stuff recently in
thailand i literally thought i was gonna vomit in the middle

902
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:50,030
of the in the middle of the food market guys okay like i
cannot stand the stuff However, however, okay, I would first

903
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:51,790
try and make a deal with the villain.

904
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:54,450
You know, there's got to be some movement here.

905
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,110
There's got to be something else.

906
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,170
Can I point out a flaw in this plan?

907
00:59:58,550 --> 00:59:58,930
What?

908
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:02,310
I would like to say, I'm, well, I'm already dead.

909
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:04,150
So, you know, I'm a lost cause.

910
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:04,750
Oh, yeah.

911
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,810
Phoebe has wings.

912
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:08,950
She's a very strong.

913
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,030
Get played, villain.

914
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:13,650
Get played.

915
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:15,350
Yeah, that's so true.

916
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,970
It's like in Sonic Adventure.

917
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:27,070
too where like rouge is falling towards the lava and it's
like bro you're a bat it's that's like with vicky exactly so

918
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:33,610
i don't even need to eat the durian oh big brain minter
thank you for saving me you saved my life you saved my life

919
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:44,330
right vicky was the one who got saved instead it was my life
you can't fly right um i mean i i oh okay we won't know till

920
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:48,590
we try the wings are there I think...

921
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:50,430
It's like throwing a baby in a pool, right?

922
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,490
That's how they learn to swim.

923
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:54,770
Yeah, yeah, it's like the baby's naturally know how to swim,
right?

924
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:55,570
It'll be the same.

925
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:59,750
Yeah, you're dropping towards my death, towards lava.

926
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:00,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

927
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:04,970
And surely my wings will start to flap and fly, fly, fly,
you know.

928
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:10,230
You know, what kind of parents are me and Minto if we don't
let our baby have these experiences?

929
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:11,270
I vote a bet.

930
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:13,290
Let's push you from the nest into the lava.

931
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:21,890
I'm so glad that my mother and father care about my
education so much.

932
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,510
I'm so glad.

933
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:25,910
It's decided then.

934
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:27,130
I'm not eating the derby.

935
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:31,720
Question 14.

936
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:32,700
Oof.

937
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,360
Would you rather fight?

938
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,560
Okay, I guess chat can answer as well for this one.

939
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:42,420
Would you rather fight a hundred mint-sized Phoebe's or one
Phoebe-sized mint?

940
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,680
It's the question.

941
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,860
We're almost the same height.

942
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:47,400
Yeah.

943
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,340
We're the same height.

944
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:55,880
I guess the person who sent this in must think that Min is
much more threatening, I suppose.

945
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:00,020
Which staff San sent this in?

946
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,080
This is a staff question?

947
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:11,420
Yeah!

948
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,160
Um...

949
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,860
What are you implying, staff San?

950
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:15,340
Yeah!

951
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:17,220
What are you saying, staff San?

952
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:23,620
Um, I feel like this would have made more sense with, like,
me and you guys, because...

953
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,160
Yeah, I don't know.

954
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,980
I mean, I would...

955
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,360
I think I could...

956
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:35,840
I think I could take either of you come at me, so I would
rather fight one of you.

957
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:39,240
So I'll go for the Phoebe-sized min-tho, I guess.

958
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,340
And that means I have to fight!

959
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:45,180
I'm sorry, Santa.

960
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:46,320
Put him up, Santa.

961
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:49,460
I think Santa's ripped, though.

962
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,740
He probably has, like, super arms carrying all of his...

963
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:52,420
Yeah, probably.

964
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,300
Actually, yeah.

965
01:02:54,660 --> 01:03:02,780
taller than you so you just grow and you grow a centimeter
so you're actually getting buffed you're getting one

966
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:14,780
centimeter by one centimeter one centimeter buff yeah makes
all the difference the surreal deep question is it all right

967
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:21,660
well chat what would you do i feel like a lot of chat
They're saying a hundred, a hundred Phoebe's.

968
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:23,020
What?

969
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:24,660
You scared, Jack.

970
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,900
You scared her.

971
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,360
The Phoebe size mint.

972
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,960
You scared of ripped Santa.

973
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:33,240
Okay.

974
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,340
Ho, ho, ho.

975
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,120
Oh, I'm scared of ripped Santa.

976
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:39,820
All right.

977
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:41,140
Fifteen.

978
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,700
Do, do, do, do, do.

979
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,920
Mint, if you had to wear either Vicky or Phoebe's outfit,
which would you like?

980
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:50,860
What would you choose and why?

981
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,580
Ooh, interesting.

982
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:53,320
What?

983
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,340
Wait, oh my gosh, that's so difficult.

984
01:03:57,140 --> 01:04:04,540
Um, on the one hand, um, I think, like, Vicky, I would want
to wear yours because I'm used to wearing a uniform.

985
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,060
Like, I'm in my main outfit all the time.

986
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,180
Makes sense, makes sense.

987
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:10,580
It, I feel like it would be, like, uncomfortable for me.

988
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,780
Maybe the chest area would be a little, I would need to...

989
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,660
It probably is a little...

990
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,920
Saggy was what I was getting.

991
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,120
Is that what I was going to say?

992
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:32,740
But at the same time, Phoebe, your outfit is so breezy and
I'm also used to my pits being out all the time.

993
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:33,760
So...

994
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:33,880
Yeah.

995
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,840
I think I would be comfortable in that one too.

996
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:37,960
Yeah.

997
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,620
We're on different reasons.

998
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,300
What are you guys saying?

999
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,540
I think you would fit, Minto, just fine.

1000
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,780
Stop that.

1001
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:52,360
No, it would be it would fit just fine.

1002
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:53,240
What are you saying?

1003
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:54,440
They're honest.

1004
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,200
They're honest.

1005
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:57,800
Chat, please.

1006
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,880
You can fit more things.

1007
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:02,100
You can fit things in there, you know, store stuff.

1008
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:03,160
Oh!

1009
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,040
Yeah!

1010
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,840
You go win some plushies at the arcade and you shove them in
there.

1011
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,580
There's more carrying space.

1012
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,580
I've seen people do that.

1013
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:18,440
They'll like, they'll carry a little plushie and then
they'll pull it out when they're trying to diffuse the

1014
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:18,840
argument.

1015
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,200
What?

1016
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:20,720
What?

1017
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:21,380
What?

1018
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:24,720
Because they're like, you gotta talk like that to him?

1019
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,140
Oh, that is so real.

1020
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,060
I'm gonna keep that in mind.

1021
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,040
That's the best kind of defense.

1022
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,300
Yeah, two eye blues could fit in there.

1023
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,380
I could just, I could be like a little, uh, a double-decker
bus, you know?

1024
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:40,660
Is that how we stop ourselves from, um, what?

1025
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,280
Shove me in there and then pull me out and be like, you're
gonna say that to him?

1026
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,500
You're gonna say that to this guy?

1027
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:58,660
Whenever there is a Phoebe and Vicky plushies, then you guys
get, everybody here can get them and then do that.

1028
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:00,380
Carry everybody around.

1029
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,800
You get into an argument with somebody, pull little Phoebe.

1030
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,400
I'd be like, you're going to say that to her.

1031
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:11,560
Yeah.

1032
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,580
Okay, yeah, that could work.

1033
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,120
You got to make marketable plushies, yep.

1034
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:22,740
I was going to say that we could use that technique, you
know, Mommy and daddy, Mint and Mint and Vicky so we don't

1035
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:26,340
fight in front of the baby, you know, so we don't fight in
front of baby Phoebe.

1036
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:27,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1037
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:34,380
You guys both have PB plushies in your chest and you both
have them both out at the same time.

1038
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,820
You're going to say that to me.

1039
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,480
You're going to say that to our baby.

1040
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:44,730
Oh my god.

1041
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:46,830
Good, good, good.

1042
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:49,490
And with that, question 16.

The twin snakes, have you guys ever heard of those?

1059
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:03,920
They're so good.

1060
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:04,500
Wait, what?

1061
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:08,180
Yeah, that sounds like an intense...

1062
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,140
Dummy worm twins?

1063
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:13,320
And it's also a Metal Gear reference, so they're even
better.

1064
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:14,440
Really?

1065
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,460
Oh!

1066
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,200
Yes.

1067
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,440
Oh my gosh.

1068
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,040
I see it.

1069
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:20,000
Yeah.

1070
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,240
Oh, they're sweet and sour.

1071
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,820
Not the pole.

1072
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,020
The power being lost.

1073
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,820
into the main account.

1074
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,680
I'm gonna say, heck yeah.

1075
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,280
I'm gonna say, heck yeah.

01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,020
What do you say, chat?

1077
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:42,000
With that, let's go to question 17.

1078
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,620
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1079
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:51,380
Phoebe, pineapple pizza.

1080
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:52,920
Yes or no?

1081
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,900
Follow up the question.

1082
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,920
What pizza topping would you order?

1083
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:12,480
the other girls dozo oh well um actually i do like pineapple
pizza i am you know what i'm yippee i'm not i'm not budging

1084
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:19,640

and and this is what i am right now is a a filthy pineapple

1085
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:26,420
pizza enjoyer that's me wait i think we've just realized
something important we're all pineapple pizza people are we

1086
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,320
yeah Yeah!

1087
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,820
You have to love us for who we are.

1088
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:33,780
Honestly, I'm going to be, I'm going to say something maybe
controversial.

1089
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,080
I think most people are pineapple pizza enjoyers, but
they're afraid of the stigma.

1090
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,060
You know what?

1091
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,740
I think they want to be, some people just want to be haters
too.

1092
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:43,880
I think so.

1093
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:47,760
They just want to be, they want to, they think they're too
cool to like pineapple pizza.

1094
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,680
Yeah, they want to be different.

1095
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:55,620
I was hanging out with some friends and we got pineapple
pizza and, and most people ate the pineapple pizza and not

1096
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,820
the cheese or the, or the other one.

1097
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:58,760
I don't remember what this is.

1098
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:00,120
Yeah.

1099
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:00,900
Oh.

1100
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:01,580
Oh, yeah.

1101
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,360
Mm-hmm.

1102
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,440
I bet they, some people snuck it.

1103
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,220
They were like, they're looking around like, is anybody,
anybody watching?

1104
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,020
Yeah.

1105
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,660
My reputation.

1106
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:13,000
I must be sneaky about this.

1107
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:18,520
Yeah, they probably just, they probably just want to be
edgy, like, no, I can't be seen eating pineapple pizza.

1108
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,400
No.

1109
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,460
I'm so cool.

1110
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:24,280
My friends will reject me.

1111
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:25,240
My family.

1112
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:26,680
My family.

1113
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:27,300
They think.

1114
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:37,820
Well, you know, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be even more
sacrilegious and say that the pizza topping I would order

1115
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:40,400
for you guys is honey drizzled on top.

1116
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,560
Wait, I love honey pizza!

1117
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,460
Vicky?

1118
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:48,420
Oh, Vicky?

1119
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,460
I prefer, I prefer my pizza more savory.

1120
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:52,900
I'm sorry.

1121
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,400
I'm a bit funny about like, savory things that taste sweet.

1122
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,540
Like, I don't like brioche.

1123
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:58,020
Like, if...

1124
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,400
If something is savory, I want it to be savory.

1125
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,300
If something is sweet, I want it to be sweet.

1126
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:03,000
I'm sorry.

1127
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:06,640
So honey on pizza is a bit of a, like, gray zone.

1128
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:11,900
I would eat it, but I would prefer, like, I'd prefer a nice
pepperoni.

1129
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:12,820
I'll be honest with you.

1130
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:13,860
Okay.

1131
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,200
I mean, I love my pepperoni.

1132
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,320
But you get a little pepperoni pizza and you drizzle some
honey on top.

1133
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,860
I would just put honey on it.

1134
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:25,940
I love honey.

1135
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,880
Well, actually, there's like...

1136
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,740
Honey loves you too.

1137
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,280
Honey loves Vicky even if Honey...

1138
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,860
Honey loves Vicky as well.

1139
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,740
Even if Vicky does not love Honey.

1140
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,300
I mean, I love Honey, but I just like it with sweet.

1141
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,960
Like, okay, the best combo.

1142
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,400
The best combo ever.

1143
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,820
Chat, there's something about it.

1144
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,300
Rosemary's and Honey.

1145
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,180
Don't hate it till you try it.

1146
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,980
It's the best combination ever.

1147
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:49,980
Yeah, it's so good.

1148
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:50,480
It's so good.

1149
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:55,260
You have told us before that that's your favorite, favorite,
like, honey combination.

1150
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,400
Wow.

1151
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,020

1152
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:04,940

tomatoes Whole umeboshi Whole umeboshi on the pizza And then

1158
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:53,280

they call it the Japanese margarita Death penalty I mean

1159
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:59,800
Genuinely it was the worst thing I've ever eaten in my life
So let's move on Yeah That gives me trauma, honestly.

1160
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,060
Alright, here we go.

1161
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:03,900
18!

1162
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,180
What are your favorite robots?

1163
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:13,660
Mecha was the original intention, but R2D2 or Jenny from My
Life as a Teenage Robot type answers are totally valid as

1164
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,100
well.

1165
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,180
I know mine.

1166
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,800
Say, say.

1167
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,560

Fireball.

01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:27,320
Yeah.

1194
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:28,020

Sorry.

1199
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:39,380
It's Disney.

1200
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,160
Please continue.

1201
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:40,820
Oh, they do that.

1202
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:41,240
They do that.

1203
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,000
Sorry, please continue.

1204
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,640
Phoebe, what is your favorite robot?

1205
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,780
Phoebe, what's your favorite about it?

1206
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:49,260
Was it like, is it like robots in general or like robot
characters?

1207
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,580
Oh, I think it could be, Eva.

1208
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:52,160
Yeah.

1209
01:15:53,380 --> 01:16:05,700
There are these pet robots in Japan that, like, can get
called uh lovots oh my gosh yeah they're very cute and and

1210
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:11,660
there are also little ones called mothlings or something
that's a different oh i've seen these but they have yeah so

1211
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:19,180
they have all these like pet robots that are smart like the
smart ai pet robots in japan and so if i were to ever move

1212
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:25,280
to japan i would want to get them they have personalities
that they can develop you can dress them up and they're like

1213
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:32,060
little babies but if we're talking characters that I think
Talburn from Freakin' Star Driver is the hottest like,

1214
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:32,560
magazine.

1215
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:36,500
The Switch Up!

1216
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,240
Oh my gosh, what the love hot!

1217
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:46,240
I once went to, I was like at a department store and they
had a pop-up and I was like looking at them and it felt like

1218
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:51,280
Build-A-Bear because you're right, they have like clothes
and stuff and like it was all like a bunch of accessories

1219
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,500
for them and I was like, what the heck is this thing?

1220
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,000
Oh, I learned.

1221
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,060
Oh, really, very cute.

1222
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:08,680
So any Densetsu fans that live in Japan, I recommend getting
a little baby Lovat for yourself.

1223
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:13,540
Yes, Star Drive, oh, based Densetsu fans, I'm so glad.

1224
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,220
I don't know, have you two watched Star Driver?

1225
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:18,460
I didn't.

1226
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:20,980
Star, I thought you said Star Trek.

1227
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:23,900
Also, Star Driver.

1228
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:25,380
No, I...

1229
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:27,920
The main guy's neck.

1230
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:39,940

yeah it's so stylish super stylish mech they're everyone in

1231
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:48,620
the show is attractive including the mechs the mechs are
attractive Phoebe I didn't know you rolled like this okay

1232
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:58,300
not usually but Star Driver is a little a little different
I'll have to date your recommendation Talbot Talbot towel

1233
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,040
burn.

1234
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,000
Towel burn.

1235
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:01,300
Nice.

1236
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:03,080
Yeah.

1237
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:03,280
Towel?

1238
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,140
It's got like a feather.

1239
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:04,880
No.

1240
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:06,040
Yeah, towel.

1241
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,440
T-A-U-B-U-R-N.

1242
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:08,780
Towel burn.

1243
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:09,180
For real though.

1244
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:09,780
I don't like it.

1245
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,200
I don't like it when you get towel burn.

1246
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:16,220
You know when you like, you do the thing, you know when you
do the thing where you've got your big towel and then you

1247
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:17,120
like dry yourself off.

1248
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:20,440
You're like drying off your butt and you like, you like
wiggle from side to side.

1249
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:23,740
Then occasionally it's like a paper cup and you can get a
towel burn.

1250
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,580
Has anyone ever got one before?

1251
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,940
You can get a towel burn?

1252
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:27,380
Yeah!

1253
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:33,360
From aggressively, like, I don't know, rubbing yourself with
a towel too much.

1254
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,120
Why do you need to rub it so hard?

1255
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,240
My eyes deliberately.

1256
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,120
You know when you're boogeying.

1257
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,900
Yeah, I just pat myself down.

1258
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,500
You know when you put yourself down.

1259
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:45,720
No, you gotta get your, you know, you gotta get your ass
dry.

1260
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:47,440
But I don't think I've ever...

1261
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,020
With my ass?

1262
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:50,020
Yeah, I just boogey naked.

1263
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:50,640
You like boogey.

1264
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:51,660
Oh, no, no.

1265
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:52,580
Okay.

1266
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:53,180
Yeah.

1267
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,800
Well, you learned a lot about Densetsu today, guys.

1268
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:01,720
Some boogie with their back, some boogie with their bum, and
some boogie with nothing on.

1269
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:02,300
Boogie.

1270
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:04,200
Boogie, boogie.

1271
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,140
Question 19.

1272
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:12,680
Vicky, I hear in Britain they dip meat pies into tea for
second breakfast.

1273
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:13,780
Is that real?

1274
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:15,100
Is that true?

1275
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,520
I'm scared.

1276
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:19,160
Where on earth have you heard this?

1277
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:22,520
The myths, the myths, the myths.

1278
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,660
Why is this filled with British myths?

1279
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,020
You guys need to get some education.

1280
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:29,960
on British people.

1281
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:31,460
I've never heard of this.

1282
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,040
What do you mean, dip a meat pie into tea?

1283
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,300
We would never dip something like that into our cup.

1284
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:42,020
We would never, in the good name of tea, what?

1285
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,340
I feel like they might.

1286
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:44,720
I feel like they might, right?

1287
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,100
I feel like if someone told me I would believe it, right?

1288
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:48,580
Yeah, I would believe it.

1289
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:49,300
I can imagine it.

1290
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:50,160
I can visualize it.

1291
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:51,880
I know I can visualize it too, yeah, right?

1292
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:55,980
Or maybe it's, maybe I'm just imagining Steiner doing that.

1293
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,640
I don't know if Vicky would.

1294
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:04,040
would oh yeah Steiner I think would probably do that but
yeah I feel like you know I feel like something probably

1295
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:08,620
takes over and she just doesn't realize she does it oh yeah
maybe she doesn't remember unless she like it wipes her

1296
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:14,020
memory off yeah yeah it's like I think it's like programmed
yeah yeah it's a good job it's the middle of the night in

1297
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:23,960
the UK right now because I'm sure Steiner would be
incredibly offended by this comment we dip sweet things into

1298
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:31,340
our tea so like tea rich tea biscuits they specifically have
these biscuits well what you call them cookies in the u.s

1299
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:37,700
they have these cookies that are specifically for you know
soaking up the flavor of tea rich tea biscuits so we do do

1300
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:47,020
stuff like that but it's always sweet stuff you never dip a
meat pie into your tea absolutely ridiculous next question

1301
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:54,980
just drink some good tea get some education whoever sent
this question in okay question 20

1302
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:58,960
Steiner here.

1303
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,380
Oh, is that him?

1304
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:02,980
Oh, dude.

1305
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:04,500
I'm sorry, Steiner.

1306
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:05,580
I'm sorry.

1307
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:06,900
I'm not.

1308
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:11,780
Steiner, is it true?

1309
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:13,440
Do you do this?

1310
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:17,300
Hope you're having fun dipping the meat pie into the tea
right now.

1311
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:22,700
He's going to say something crazy, like, oh, yeah, sometimes
it'll slip from my hand and it becomes like a meat soup.

1312
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,080
He would.

1313
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:26,760
No, no.

1314
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:37,960
okay dipping it in beer though that's kind of different like
dipping it in tea seems like sacrilege to me but dipping a

1315
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:45,220
meat pie in a bit of beer that actually sounds kind of nice
anyway what do you think is the biggest charm point of your

1316
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:52,000
model oh so like our designs i guess and that kind of
question how we look yeah yeah

1332
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:44,300
So for me, I think...

1333
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:50,880
See, I would have said, like, ooh, the whole collarbone area
with, like, the little mole and the collarbone area.

1334
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,420
But I think...

1335
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:55,480
I think, like, I'm...

1336
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:59,720
The face in general makes me happy, because I feel like I
can do a lot of...

1337
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,260
It just feels like it's got a lot of personality.

1338
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:04,240
Yeah!

1339
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:07,440
I like the way that it looks when I'm chewing food.

1340
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:10,240
It reminds me of my bunny.

1341
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:13,480
I love that one clip.

1342
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,100
And then the eyebrows.

1343
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,100
Yeah.

1344
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:18,240
The one where we were streaming all...

1345
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,740
Chained together together.

1346
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,240
Oh, that was...

1347
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:23,940
That was cute.

1348
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:25,260
It was so cute.

1349
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:27,160
It was very silly.

1350
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,940
He was literally eating like a little bunny.

1351
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:30,720
Little bunny.

1352
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:34,220
Yeah, your mouth like does the trunk.

1353
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:46,580
triangle it's so cute oh yeah so sweet oh for you as well I
really like your like uh sheer lace gloves Phoebe I think

1354
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:59,860
that's what I was gonna say yeah it's really cute I do like
that they don't go all the way down to the fingertips as

1355
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:09,200
well they look more like arm bands yeah it's a kind of a I
like my um my mama a psyche a hero like touched up the

1356
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:14,300
original design a little bit and like decided to change a
few things and The the fact that they're transparent.

1357
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,920
I think like the way that they're styled is her

1358
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:33,440
My both of both of you is so so beautiful Thank you question
three of us twenty one By the way, do you do you like these

1359
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:34,220
little advent things?

1360
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,000
bought them somewhere for $20.

1361
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,500
Yeah, they're cute.

1362
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,440
They're really cute.

1363
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:46,720
If you all compete against each other in a bake-off, what
would, oh God, I can't really bake.

1364
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:50,360
So what would be your masterpiece and who do you think would
win?

1365
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:52,500
Congrats on the debut.

1366
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:54,240
Thank you.

1367
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:56,640
Bake-off.

1368
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:59,040
So like the great pretty baby would win.

1369
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:00,560
Yeah, Phoebe's the only one that bakes.

1370
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:04,100
Am I the only one out of the three of us?

1371
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:10,020
I think the thing that made me realize this as well is like
this isn't even baking like when Phoebe put up Did you pop a

1372
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:14,920
picture of like some amazing charcuterie board that
literally looked like the most beautiful thing I've ever

1373
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,920
seen in my life when was that?

1374
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:18,360
I'm happy you liked it.

1375
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,000
Yeah, I did.

1376
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:22,520
I like to make little roses It was so beautiful and I was
like wow.

1377
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:31,780
I think Phoebe might be so I think the baby's gonna have to
cook for the mom and dad Sorry I'm crazy Sometimes you're

1378
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:34,860
forced to grow up That's so fair.

1379
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:35,520
You know.

1380
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,840
But okay, then if by default I win, then between the two of
you.

1381
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,180
I don't count.

1382
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,820
So let me give you my sort of history in baking.

1383
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,860
So I've definitely tried to make some things.

1384
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:59,160
I made a slanting two tiered cake where the top tier fell
off the bottom tier and slide it off.

1385
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:01,380
Trying to think what else?

1386
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:03,980
Not gray basically.

1387
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:05,100
What about you, Minto?

1388
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:11,040
Um, I once made a pre-made gingerbread house.

1389
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:12,200
Oh, okay.

1390
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:23,500
Yeah, and I made pizza with, like, Kiwi and Duryan and candy
corn and corn.

1391
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:25,220
Duryan?

1392
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:25,520
Yeah.

1393
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:26,220
Duryan.

1394
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,060
Oh, I've got... I almost threw up to...

1395
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:30,460
I imagine you did.

1396
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:31,860
Oh, I've got another thing.

1397
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,580
Yeah, it was a pizza.

1398
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:35,580
Did you guys ever have to do, like, cooking stuff for
school.

1399
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,680
Like, in the UK, we had food tech.

1400
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,860
And you had to make stuff.

1401
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:46,800
And then, like, your parents or something had to review it
and, like, be like, it's got sweetness, three, and

1402
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,340
tastiness, four or something.

1403
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:50,960
My parents refused to eat anything I made.

1404
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:52,340
They knew.

1405
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,020
I made some awful stuff.

1406
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:59,200
No, they refused, flat out, to eat anything that I made.

1407
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:03,460
So that also gives you an idea of my skills.

1408
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:18,380
yeah oh maybe i'd come in the middle then yeah i think
probably i'd come last i reckon i'm still the breadwinner i

1409
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:26,580
love this the baby's cooking for both parents and then the
mother takes care of everything in the house except except

1410
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:35,400
the cooking and then and the minto's like you know like a
little bit of a We're good at everything.

1411
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:35,860
Yeah.

1412
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:36,460
Oh, yeah.

1413
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:37,700
Give me a wrench.

1414
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,100
Thanks, thanks, Dad.

1415
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:40,260
Thanks, baby.

1416
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I got you.

1417
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,520
Very nice, very nice.

1418
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:50,620
Question, we've got three more questions left of the
marshmallow advent.

1419
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:52,000
Then you guys get a surprise.

1420
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:52,960
Question 22.

1421
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:54,040
Oh, surprise.

1422
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,540
On the 22nd day of advent.

1423
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:59,760
On the 22nd day of advent, mine.

1424
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:01,860
Did you watch any dub?

1425
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:03,520
It's my mother gave to me.

1426
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:07,080
A really awful meal.

1427
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:11,440
Did you watch any dubbed anime on TV as a kid?

1428
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:12,940
What was your favorite?

1429
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:14,600
Did you guys watch dubbed anime?

1430
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,560
I did.

1431
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:19,700
Four Kids TV.

1432
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:23,920
You see, I don't really have that as much.

1433
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,980
I feel like I didn't have the channels that had anime on it.

1434
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:33,400
I had to wait till I went to a friend's house and be like,
Oh yeah, Dexter's Laboratory.

1435
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,160
That was me with Disney.

1436
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:39,100
Oh, yeah.

1437
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,300
No, I didn't.

1438
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:44,380
No, I had the basic channels.

1439
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:46,500
Bit of CBBC, that was it.

1440
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:49,460
You guys don't even know what that is.

1441
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:50,600
But yeah, yeah.

1442
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,560
I had the basic channels.

1443
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:56,200
But I did, they did show, they did show Pokemon.

1444
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,340
So I did watch Pokemon when I was a kid.

1445
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,900
But I think that was maybe the only thing.

1446
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,020
Yeah, because there just wasn't many options.

1447
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:04,060
But you guys.

1448
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:07,780
I think Pokemon is a solid choice though.

1449
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:11,340
I think that's a lot of our first like dog anime.

1450
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:12,000
Yeah.

1451
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,180
I also really like the Sailor Moon dub.

1452
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:18,360
Like I think the way they're like Serena.

1453
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:19,900
Yeah.

1454
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:23,600
And she would be like, oh my goodness I'm so sorry.

1455
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,940
I hit the end and I just feel like it.

1456
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:29,860
It was fun.

1457
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:30,760
It was fun.

1458
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,220
I don't think I've ever seen it, but I want to see it.

1459
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:50,780
after that serena yeah it's like iconic serena serena these
donuts are great she was serena yeah name changes the name

1460
01:30:50,780 --> 01:31:00,220
changes what about you fevers there's a lot of like a lot of
stuff that was on like 4Kids and all that so like yeah Sonic

1461
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:04,920
X had the anime with the dogs There's like Yu-Gi-Oh!

1462
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,120
Oh, yeah!

1463
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:11,820
Uh, Yu-Gi-Oh, and oh wait, there was like, there was some
magical girl stuff too, like, Ojama Joe Doremi, or magic,

1464
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:13,020
sorry, magical Doremi.

1465
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,880
Not Tokyo Mew-Mew, but Mew-Mew Power.

1466
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:16,660
Mew-Mew-Mew Power.

1467
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:20,460
Oh my god, I watched a lot of Duel Masters.

1468
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,320
I've loved that show too.

1469
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:24,160
It's like the one- Duel Masters!

1470
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:29,660
Yeah, it's like the one, like, card game that, like, I don't
know, I don't think it's took off so much.

1471
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:31,300
I don't know if it's so popular with the kids.

1472
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,500
Such a long...

1473
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:36,200
Wait, it's not Yu-Gi-Oh, it's something else?

1474
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:37,940
Yeah, it's Duel Masters.

1475
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:39,180
Oh, I've never heard of it.

1476
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:42,240
I wonder if it's still a franchise at all.

1477
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,340
I have no idea.

1478
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:44,720
Oh, do, do.

01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,140
Oh, man, you guys have Sonic X.

Like, you got...

1484
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:57,860
With Disney Channel, you also got the channel that had Sonic
X on it, and I never had that.

1485
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:01,060
Oh, lucky.

1486
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,300

01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:40,480
Sometimes when I go to performances, somebody will have
their Bayblade stuff.

1492
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,160
Actually, a recent check-y I got to take at U.S.

1493
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:47,380
Idol Fest was somebody just pulled out their entire Bayblade
arena thing.

They took the check-y as soon as we, like, let it rip.

1497
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:54,600
It was great.

1498
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,840
I lost, I think.

1499
01:32:57,980 --> 01:33:00,080
Is that what you say with Bayblades?

1500
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:00,820
Let it rip.

1501
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:02,160
Let it rip.

1502
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:13,000
yeah yeah makes me think of something else but anyway that's
a tagline makes me think of a little don't think about it

1503
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:23,040
don't think about it uh i'm currently buying a pack of
peanut m&ms as i type this i can't think of anything better

1504
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:29,900
so if you had to choose one snack to have for the rest of
your life or afterlife what would it be i'm a ride or die

1505
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:33,760
for peanut m&ms geez do you think peanut M&Ms.

1506
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:38,340
I think I think maybe they do.

1507
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:42,000
You want some more peanut M&Ms?

1508
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,020
You didn't get enough, clearly.

1509
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:44,680
Yeah.

1510
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,180
Peanut M&Ms on the brain.

1511
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:49,340
Do you guys have an answer to this one?

1512
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,100
I think I do have a quite quick answer, actually.

1513
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:53,200
Yeah.

1514
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:54,100
Olives.

1515
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,760
I love olives.

1516
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:57,640
I'm sorry.

1517
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:58,060
I'm sorry.

1518
01:33:58,140 --> 01:33:58,880
I love olives.

1519
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,600
I think the thing with olives is I never get tired of them.

1520
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:06,620
Like, I could just have a bowl of them all the time and i
never get tired of them i have them with my lunch on my

1521
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:13,980
salad every day love them i could have them forever and
never get bored sorry mento now i know i feel like i've

1522
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:24,940
offended mento i'll give all the olives to you yeah yeah
yeah wait neither of you like olives yeah yeah yeah what

1523
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:35,220
about you guys what about you mento do you have one i think
mine would be The Manan Life Konyak Jelly Packets that you

1524
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:36,020
can get at Konbini.

1525
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,220
I think I would eat that for the rest of my life.

1526
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:41,760
No.

1527
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:43,280
Yeah.

1528
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:45,360
I love...

1529
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,180
I just love jelly.

1530
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,940
Jellies are good.

1531
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,340
Do they flavor the Konyak?

1532
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:52,600
Yeah.

1533
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,940
I specifically like the grape one.

1534
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,180
So it's like...

1535
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:58,060
Oh, it's so yummy.

1536
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,320
And it's like healthy.

1537
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:02,020
Yeah, it's better for you.

1538
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:02,580
Yeah.

1539
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:05,520
Olives and cognac jellies.

1540
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,340
Both reasonably healthy options, to be fair.

1541
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:14,280
Yeah, well, if I were to choose a, like, a savor, more
savory option, it would be, like, the super cheesy

1542
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:14,990
cheez-its.

1543
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:16,540
Oh.

1544
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,000
Like the cheddar blast cheez-its.

1545
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,600
Oh, those are good.

1546
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:20,380
Oh.

1547
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:24,240
I don't, I've never had those, but I guess an equivalent.

1548
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:26,320
In the UK, I would go for quavers.

1549
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:28,060
Do you know what, do you know, quavers?

1550
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:34,200
They're, like, really, like, curly cheesy crisp i think
you'd like them i think you'd like them if you like cheese

1551
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:42,900
it's yeah i'll bring you some cheese it's next time i'll
bring you some quaver's when i go back okay heck yeah i'll

1552
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:55,600
bring the cheese puffs cheese balls the cheese balls i saw
all of y'all trying to see how many cheese ball tubs hi i am

1553
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:08,280
i was how how many did you get for you I'm well so I did end
up like We measured it We measured it at Anime Week in

1554
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:17,040
Atlanta We stacked it We used someone's credit card to make
sure that we were putting the Putting the The tub down in

1555
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:30,180
the right place I'm like about four About four Cheeseball
tubs I guess So people's calculations were correct Yeah You

1556
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:36,920
know, I was once given, I was also once given, gifted a
cheeseball tub of the same sort.

1557
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,780
And I ate through that cheeseball tub.

1558
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:46,220
And I have not had a cheeseball ever since because I said, I
am good for the rest of my afterlife.

1559
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:50,800
I will never need another cheeseball.

1560
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:56,500
And so I felt a little trauma through your cheeseball
journey.

1561
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,840
Do you think that's really the aim?

1562
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:10,720
back traumatizing memories oh no yes are the people giving
you these cheeseballs oh oh no go ahead i was just gonna ask

1563
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:16,480
if they're cheeseball lovers or cheeseball haters for giving
you these you know maybe they maybe they're like yeah if we

1564
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:22,720
give them this they'll never want cheeseballs ever again
yeah yeah it's a very good question you'll never want it

1565
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:32,280
again I promise maybe maybe I need to finish the tub first
and exactly how I feel But maybe I'll just be sad.

1566
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:33,920
Maybe I'll miss it.

1567
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:36,440
And in which case that would be the answer to this question.

1568
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:39,920
If not, probably like, I don't know, cookies.

1569
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,960
I can always go for a good chocolate chip cookie.

1570
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,740
Maybe you can keep a diary about how you're feeling about
cheeseballs.

1571
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:48,300
Every cheeseball you take from the tub.

1572
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:49,120
Maybe.

1573
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:50,640
It's day 300.

1574
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:54,740
There is still half the tub of cheeseballs.

1575
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:58,860
How am I feeling about it?

1576
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:00,040
I have to rate it on a scale.

1577
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:03,660
of one to five every day, how I'm feeling about the
cheeseballs.

1578
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:08,360
Oh my gosh, you know how there's like diaries where you do
like kind of like say, like it says like, what's your mood

1579
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:09,480
today and things like that?

1580
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:13,820
You can get one specifically made for cheeseball like
documentation.

1581
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:21,000
That's been my new mission in 2026 is to document my
experience with its cheeseballs.

1582
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:23,600
And you could sell it as goods as a memoir.

1583
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,360
The cheeseball memoir.

1584
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,160
I need to be honest though.

1585
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:31,980
I now have Two tubs of cheese balls.

1586
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,920
So, let me just say.

1587
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:35,100
You're not going to make it.

1588
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:39,680
Someone ordered a surprise gift for me on a throne.

1589
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:42,300
And it was the cheese balls.

1590
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:53,520
And then at Anime Week in Atlanta, another fan gifted me a
tub of cheese balls.

1591
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:55,740
The same tub of cheese balls.

1592
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:00,040
So, I now have two.

1593
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:02,980
whole tubs of Oots cheese balls.

1594
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:05,420
Thank you everybody that's half my size.

1595
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:06,340
Yippee!

1596
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:08,920
Wow.

1597
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:11,180
Well good luck with that.

1598
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:14,900
In the meantime it's our last advent guys.

1599
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:15,640

1600
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:17,980

01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,060
Oh my god we're here.

1602
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:24,440
Would you punch one of your fans for one million dollars?

1603
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:28,640
That's a great question to finish off.

1604
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:30,040
That's a great question.

1605
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:37,520
in my question for this is are they into it right right
that's what i'm thinking there would probably be so many

1606
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:45,580
that that would be like yes please please please pick me my
lord because if it's gonna make them sad or hurt them then

1607
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:52,300
like no i don't i would not for a billion dollars but if
they're if it makes them happy even makes them smile yeah

1608
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:58,720
there's got to be at least one right in each of our fan
bases that like wants that to happen really bad and then we

1609
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:07,400
all get a million bish bash bush everyone's happy yeah yeah
yeah me me there seems to be a lot of people saying me me me

And you've got to say what the lyrics are.

1622
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:54,740
Let's first decide what you want for your buzzer noises.

So you guys can decide on a little buzzer noise for each of
you.

What are you guys going to do?

1625
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:02,280
Oh, should we, like, open our soundboard?

Oh, if you have some, that'd be great.

1627
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:07,260

01:43:28,230 --> 01:43:41,370

case in that case we are ready we are ready to go so the

1658
01:43:41,370 --> 01:43:49,190

1659
01:43:49,190 --> 01:44:00,930
along as well but do not give them the answers okay question
wait chat said they can't hear it It was while I was

1660
01:44:00,930 --> 01:44:01,310
testing.

1661
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:02,990
They will be able to hear it now.

1662
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:03,430
Okay, okay, okay.

1663
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:04,790
They will be able to hear it.

1664
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:05,470
Ah, okay.

1665
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:06,470
Okay.

1666
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:09,030
Question one.

1667
01:44:09,330 --> 01:44:11,490
Question one coming in now.

1668
01:44:11,610 --> 01:44:15,630
Remember, it's the first to buzz in with the correct lyric.

1669
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:20,310
Santa cutie and fill my stocking.

1670
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:21,790
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1671
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:26,680
Bend?

1672
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:27,960
Yes, Pikmin?

1673
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,480
With the duplex and checks.

1674
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:39,380
That means we have one point of...

1675
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:41,540
I realize I should probably keep track of the points
somehow.

1676
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:42,200
Give me a second, Chad.

1677
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:46,360
Let me just add a quick little point system.

1678
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:47,840
Yubi!

1679
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:50,020
Okay, well done, Phoebe.

1680
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:53,980
That gives Phoebe one point already.

1681
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:55,740
She's evolving like a Pokemon.

1682
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:57,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1683
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:00,140
One point to Phoebe.

1684
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:03,960
Minto, you need to, you know, you need to...

1685
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:07,720
Step up your game to be able to get some points in this
round.

1686
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:09,500
1.2, Phoebe.

1687
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:10,860
Alright, are we ready?

1688
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:13,960
Are we ready for the next part?

1689
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:15,760
Here we go.

1690
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:21,980
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

1691
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:25,560
Santa baby.

1692
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:36,500
So, it's the bit specifically after that.

1693
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:37,700
Maybe this is too hot.

1694
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:43,360
It's the bit specifically after the...

1695
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:44,460
Maybe no Googling.

1696
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:45,480
No Googling.

1697
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,200
No Googling, okay?

1698
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,180
No Googling.

1699
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:52,440
Okay, you ready to go again?

1700
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:55,000
Ready to go again, you guys?

1701
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:55,860
Wait, is the stream alive?

1702
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:56,880
Wait, is the stream?

1703
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:57,780
Oh, one second.

1704
01:45:58,280 --> 01:45:58,740
What's happening?

1705
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:04,820
Is the snowy background maybe making the stream like five
frames per second possible?

1706
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:05,780
Yeah, it's really...

1707
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:06,460
Possibly.

1708
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:07,600
What's happening?

1709
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,160
The stream is lagging.

1710
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:12,400
The stream is at least it's choppy.

1711
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:13,260
The video itself.

1712
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:14,280
Oh, yes.

1713
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:18,060
Okay, it's not choppy in my OBS, but I can see that it's
choppy.

1714
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:19,480
Okay, interesting.

1715
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:20,420
Be glad.

1716
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,740
Is it maybe the animated background?

1717
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:27,240
Hmm, interesting.

1718
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,520
I know, it's interesting because it's not like it's very
different than what it was earlier.

1719
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:36,580
Yeah, it's no problem on my end, interesting.

1720
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:46,560
uh obs doesn't have an issue either is it youtube it started
once you started the audio do you think it's that for some

1721
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:58,480
reason but it's it i feel like then obs would be lagging obs
is not lagging at all i feel like it might be i feel like it

1722
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:07,180
might be youtube oh okay it started only after the music the
music Oh.

1723
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:10,880
How do I do that?

1724
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:13,080
Audio is good, though, they said.

1725
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:14,620
Oh, audio is good?

1726
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:16,300
That's very odd.

1727
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:20,980
Okay, let me go to loading screen and see if there's
anything I can do.

1728
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:21,980
Okay.

1729
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:24,520
Otherwise, it's nice that the audio is...

1730
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:25,980
Oh, it suddenly got okay for me.

1731
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:27,340
Oh, yeah, me too.

1732
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:27,760
Me too.

1733
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:28,560
Oh, me too.

1734
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:28,860
What?

1735
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:29,400
Okay.

1736
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:30,220
What happened?

1737
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,180
Did anything change?

1738
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:34,740
Maybe YouTube had a bit of an issue for some reason.

1739
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:35,660
Because nothing...

1740
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:36,580
I think YouTube...

1741
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:47,360
change yeah i think it might have been youtube can you guys
hear now okay all right very odd yeah i haven't had any

1742
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:55,900
change on obs side so i think it might just be a temporary
youtube issue okay i think it was a youtube day can you guys

1743
01:47:55,900 --> 01:48:05,700
see now is it all good okay not sure what happened frames

1746
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:30,740

might have been a short problem with the YouTube.

1747
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:31,760
Sorry about that.

1748
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:32,620

We are back and ready to go.

1753
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:36,980
Okay.

1754
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:38,700
And the lyrics are chicken.

1755
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:39,380
Yes.

1756
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:40,300
The lyrics are chicken.

1757
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:41,920
Okay.

1758
01:48:42,380 --> 01:48:43,080
Here we go.

1759
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,580
Are you ready guys?

1760
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:48,800
Let's see if you guys can get a point.

1761
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:49,220
Okay.

1762
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:50,460
Maybe that one was too hard.

1763
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,780
Let's try a slightly easier one.

1764
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:53,080
Okay.

1765
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:53,580
Okay.

1766
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:56,880
Let's try this one.

1767
01:48:57,200 --> 01:49:01,840
Think of all The fun I've missed

1768
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:19,220
Yes, yes, to-through To-through Think of all the fellas that
I haven't kissed Zika Well done, Minto That brings Minto up

1769
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:30,660

going One point for Minto Mint, Mint Point Which brings us

1770
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:33,160
to one point each so far.

1771
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:34,220
How are we feeling?

1772
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:36,840
Level pegging right now, chat.

01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:39,100
Who do we think is going to win?

1774
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:43,240
Well, there are many more questions to come, so we will have
to see.

1775
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:44,440
All right.

1776
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:45,760
All right.

1777
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:46,300
All right.

1778
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:47,220
Here we go.

1779
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:50,420
Question two for the chicken.

1780
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:51,420
Are you guys ready?

1781
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:52,380

Here we go.

1784
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,840
On the third day of Christmas, my true love sent to me.

1785
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:13,860
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree On the third
day of Christmas my true love sent to me Two turtle doves

1786
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:21,200
and a partridge in a pear tree Any ideas?

1787
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:26,080
Take a guess, take a guess Okay, tuturu, yes

Dorians, two turtle doves, and a partridge And a partridge

1789
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:43,800

I'll play a tree.

1792
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:02,460
Zika!

1793
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:10,320
Yes, Phoebe has three French hens, which means Phoebe gets
another point.

1794
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:15,240
And then you said two turtle dubs, and I was like, oh, I
thought it was turtle dubs, too.

1795
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:16,040
Yeah.

1796
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:23,340
I realize every time I press a number, it's changing my
reindeer hood, so please, please, please just ignore that.

1797
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:25,960
You're, like, evolving like a Pokemon.

1798
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:27,640
It's so funny.

1799
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:32,560
Question to, along a similar line, I will say.

1800
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:37,020
On the sixth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me.

1801
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:42,000
Five gold rings.

1802
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:44,620
Should I play it again?

1803
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:48,160
See if anything, see if anything jogs your memory.

1804
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:50,280
Anyone in chat, anyone in chat got it.

1805
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:52,740
Anyone in chat got it yet, I wonder.

1806
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:54,120
I keep thinking turtle doves.

1807
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:56,860
I never think the turtle doves.

1808
01:51:57,200 --> 01:51:59,040
I was like, four turtle doves.

1809
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:14,220
Three turtle doves Two turtle doves And a turtle doves
Alright let's play it again Six, six What do we think?

1810
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:27,960
Okay On the sixth day of Christmas My true love sent to me
Five gold rings Oh, Pikmin, Pikmin Oh, yes, Phoebe Is it

1811
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:28,420
six?

1812
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:30,800
Six eggs are laying.

1813
01:52:31,820 --> 01:52:33,320
Six eggs are laying.

1814
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:34,920
Oh, yes, yes.

1815
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:37,120
No, you're so close, but that is wrong.

1816
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:39,940
Mint, do you want to take a guess along a similar line?

1817
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:42,700
Six maidens dancing.

1818
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:44,840
No.

1819
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,400
Phoebe is so close.

1820
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:49,080
There's a maiden dancing, though, right?

1821
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:50,420
Phoebe was so close.

1822
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:51,240
Am I close?

1823
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:52,780
You're so close, Phoebe.

1824
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:53,200
It's not six eggs are laying.

1825
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:55,160
Six turtle dogs.

1826
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:55,900
Final answer.

1827
01:52:56,980 --> 01:52:58,820
Who could be laying the eggs?

1828
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:01,200
Who's laying the eggs?

1829
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:02,580
Oh, oh, the geese!

1833
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:08,240
Six Phoebe's are laying.

1834
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:09,460
Wait, no.

1835
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:10,480
No!

1836
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:13,680
No!

1837
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:14,540
No!

1838
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,080
Six, six geese are laying.

01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:21,080
Six geese are laying!

1840
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:21,740

1841
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:25,600
Well done, that means Phoebe.

1842
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:27,440
Yeah, sorry, eggs don't lay their eggs.

1843
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:28,960
Yeah, eggs don't lay themselves.

1844
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:41,220
at least they don't at the moment maybe in the future what
mind blown mind blown okay one last one on this question

1845
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:52,420

1847
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:02,020
Not quite.

1848
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:03,180
It's not maidens.

1849
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:05,740
Oh, cows milking.

1850
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,200
You're so close.

01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:11,140
You're so close.

1852
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:13,080
With eight maidens milking.

1853
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:16,040
It's eight maidens milking, right?

1854
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:20,120
Okay, right.

1855
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:21,480
What do you get?

1856
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:24,440
What's like maiden but not maiden?

1857
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:26,520
If you take off some letters from maiden.

1858
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:28,400
Oh.

1859
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:42,340

nearly to even points i think nearly nearly but not quite

1861
01:54:54,520 --> 01:55:01,600
all right the last question of the chicken round how many
people in chat are getting yeah people people are saying

1862
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:17,180

question chat will you get it quicker than phoebe and minto

1863
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:25,040
let's find out here we go let's see rocking around the
christmas tree at the christmas party hub

1864
01:55:31,290 --> 01:55:33,050
I thought of the wrong part.

1865
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:34,170
Shall I play it again?

1866
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:35,250
See if it jogs your memory.

1867
01:55:35,410 --> 01:55:35,990
Here we go.

1868
01:55:36,450 --> 01:55:41,410
Rocking around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party
hop.

1869
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:47,600
Yes, toototot, yes.

1870
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,720
Everyone's shouting and kicking to the beat.

1871
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,120
Merrily.

1872
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:59,560
Christmas party rock.

1873
01:56:04,280 --> 01:56:14,080
no no that is not correct rocking around the Christmas tree
mint sounding kind of like how you know you get this really

1874
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:24,840
awful like AI recreations of Christmas songs I think it's
something like this rockin dancing right okay let's play it

1875
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:33,960
again rocking around the Christmas tree at the Christmas
party hub I can't remember.

1876
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:36,760
My brain is going to the wrong part of the song.

1877
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:37,700
I know it's wrong.

1878
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:40,820
Because everyone's dancing merrily is not the right...

1879
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:42,500
Oh, wait, is that not it?

1880
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,000
Oh, Phoebe, yep, yep.

1881
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:47,380
Oh, um, Mesutohang, where you can't see.

1882
01:56:47,900 --> 01:56:48,140
Sing!

1883
01:56:50,580 --> 01:56:52,760
Mesutohang, where you can't see.

1884
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:54,700
Well done, Phoebe, that's another point.

1885
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:56,340
I don't remember the line after.

1886
01:56:56,540 --> 01:56:57,200
That's another point to you.

1887
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:58,900
Thank God I didn't have to do the part afterwards.

1888
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:02,060
Well, lucky for you, there's more.

1889
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:15,360
another question from this song here we go you will get a
sentimental feeling when you hear voices singing let's be

1890
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:32,700
jolly yes yes yes oh no wait hold on take the halls with
brows of holly yeah well done well done mean tall that

1891
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:41,640
brings it up to three four this is a close game guys it
really is anyone's it really is anyone's game you don't know

1892
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:49,620
what rounds you don't know what rounds are coming yet
rocking around the christmas tree have a happy holiday

1893
01:57:49,620 --> 01:58:03,940
everyone dancing merrily okay yes pickman yes in the new
old-fashioned way Hi, well done, Phoebe.

1894
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:12,480
And that brings us at the end of the lyrics a chicken round,
the current victor is Phoebe.

1895
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:18,060
But we have two rounds to go, so it could really be anyone's
game.

1896
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:21,340
All right, let's put up a quick cheeky poll.

1897
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:24,280
Who will win?

1898
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:26,540
Who will win?

1899
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,520
I was going to vote for Phoebe.

1900
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:28,560
Minto.

1901
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:30,180
I don't know about that, dude.

1902
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:31,100
I don't know about that.

1903
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:34,140
You don't know what rounds are coming, guys.

1904
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:36,140
It could really be anyone's...

1905
01:58:36,140 --> 01:58:37,440
We're not going to be chicken anymore.

1906
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:37,980
No.

1907
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:43,460
It's time for the next round, which is...

1908
01:58:53,820 --> 01:58:56,880
Why is it so British?

1909
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:09,580
So for this round, everyone, I'm going to be reading the
lyrics of some popular Christmas songs.

1910
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:16,080
You are going to have to guess which song these are from,
but I will not be singing the lyrics.

1911
01:59:16,220 --> 01:59:24,540
I will simply be reading them in this voice, and you will
have to guess which song this is from.

1912
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:25,540
Okay.

1913
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:29,620
Are you ready, Mint and Phoebe, and chat?

1914
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:32,340
We?

1915
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:34,340
Yes,

1916
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:39,120
yes, I'm ready.

1917
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:41,000
I think I'm feeling quite ready.

1918
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:44,560
Are you as ready as you are going to be?

1919
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:46,620
As we are going to be.

1920
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:47,040
Yes.

1921
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:50,160
Here we go then.

1922
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:52,640
Please forgive me.

1923
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:55,800
The British iPad is being very slow.

1924
01:59:56,500 --> 02:00:00,120
Please bear with me.

1925
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:11,760
the british experience yes this is also part of the whole
experience absolutely um oh my gosh why is it being so slow

Yeah.

1932
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:41,560
I don't think it would taste that good.

1933
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:42,920
On the barbie.

1934
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:46,460

Are you ready?

1937
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:51,120
So we're just guessing the song, right?

1938
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:51,600
Yes.

1939
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:52,480
Okay.

1940
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:53,160
Okay.

1941
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:59,100
And when I'm feeling alone, you remind me of home.

1942
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,580
Oh, baby, baby.

1943

Phoebe otherwise we will go to a slightly more recognizable

1945
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:34,640
part of the song.

1946
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:37,380
I mean, Rudolph.

1947
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:38,980
The red nose.

1948
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:39,660
Incorrect.

1949
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:40,820
Incorrect.

1950
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:45,260
So we will go to a different pie.

1951
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:51,940
Sweet dreams of Holly and Ribbon.

1952
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,980
Mistakes are forgiven.

1953
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:59,880
And everything is icy and blue.

1954
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:13,620
And you would be there too sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
I don't mistakes are forgiven and everything is icy and blue

1956
02:02:25,820 --> 02:02:32,400
incorrect any more guesses from Phoebe before we move on.

1957
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:35,840
Is this a Michael Boublaze song at least?

1958
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:36,480
Maybe.

1959
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:38,460
No, it's not.

1960
02:02:40,660 --> 02:02:41,140
Okay.

1961
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:42,320
I know this one.

1962
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:43,760
Oh, some people in chat have got it.

1963
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:44,540
Some people have got it.

1964
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:44,900
Okay.

1965
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:46,940
This is much harder than I thought it would be.

1966
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:48,700
Yeah, that's the way this corner works.

1967
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,460
Then you hear the song and you're like, oh!

1968
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:51,620
Okay.

1969
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:55,640
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm.

1970
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:58,060
There's a light in the barn.

1971
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:01,480
We'd Run inside, out from the cold.

1972
02:03:02,220 --> 02:03:05,240
In the town, kids are dreaming of slays.

1973
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:07,960
And they're warm, and they're safe.

1974
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:11,440
They wake to see a blanket of snow.

1975
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:14,240
I don't think you guys are good.

1976
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:15,980
If you can't get it from that, I don't think you're going to
get it.

1977
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:17,900
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

1978
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:19,560
I have no freaking clue.

1979
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:23,400
It was Christmas Tree Farm by Taylor Swift.

1980
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:27,120
Oh, no wonder I didn't.

1981
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:28,160
I'm sorry.

1982
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:41,120

02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:11,960
We are currently on the why is it so British corner where
Phoebe and Minto have to guess the song where I simply speak

1987
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:13,860
the lyrics in this voice.

1988
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:17,360
Okay.

1989
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:22,060
Gone away is the bluebird.

Here to stay.

1991
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,060

1992
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:27,260
Oh, the pigmen!

1993
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:28,460
Yes.

1994
02:04:28,860 --> 02:04:31,620
I forgot my alarm sound for a second.

1995
02:04:31,740 --> 02:04:34,580
Um, walking in a winter wonderland.

1996
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:34,880
Ah!

1997
02:04:35,380 --> 02:04:36,840
I could remember the name of the song.

1998
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:40,580
Yes, it's winter wonderland.

1999
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,020
Well done, Phoebe.

2000
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:47,280
That gives you a point to bring you up to six.

2001
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:48,500
Well done.

2002
02:04:48,860 --> 02:04:52,040
Okay, we're going to do one more in this round.

2003
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:53,080
Okay.

2004
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:56,660
Let's do this.

2005
02:04:56,820 --> 02:04:58,840
I don't know if you guys are going to know this one either,
but...

2006
02:04:58,860 --> 02:04:59,420
It'll be funny.

2007
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:01,780
Okay.

2008
02:05:02,260 --> 02:05:03,180
She's already mad at me.

2009
02:05:04,140 --> 02:05:04,320
Right.

2010
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:05,070
Here we go.

2011
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:10,140
Everyone's gathering around the fire.

2012
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:13,680
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July.

2013
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:16,880
I should be chilling with my folks.

2014
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:17,720
I know.

2015
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:21,020
But I'ma be under the mistletoe.

2016
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:24,060
With you, Shorty.

2017
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:24,820
With you.

2018
02:05:25,180 --> 02:05:27,200
With you, Shorty.

2019
02:05:27,340 --> 02:05:27,500
What?

2020
02:05:27,820 --> 02:05:28,120
With you.

2021
02:05:28,120 --> 02:05:28,560

2025
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:00,080

02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:00,700
Oh, keep going.

2027
02:06:00,980 --> 02:06:01,200
Keep going.

2028
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:02,180
Is it shorty with you?

2029
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:04,360
It's not called shorty with you.

2030
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:05,580
Stop it!

2031
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:07,920
Okay.

2032
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:11,000
For the buzzer, for the buzzer.

2033
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:13,300
Remember guys, buzz in if you know the answer.

2034
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:14,220
Okay.

2035
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:16,160
Word on the street.

2036
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:17,920
Santa's coming tonight.

2037
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:21,480
Ranges flying through the sky so high.

2038
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:23,640
I should be making a list.

2039
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:24,440
I know.

2040
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:27,220
But I'm going to be under the mistletoe.

2041
02:06:28,860 --> 02:06:29,060
Yes.

2042
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:30,820
Under the mistletoe?

2043
02:06:31,980 --> 02:06:34,780
So close, but unfortunately no.

2044
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:35,300
Pickman?

2045
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:36,260
Yes.

2046
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:38,760
Mistletoe?

2047
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:41,120
Mistletoe?

2048
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:45,880
Simply mistletoe by Justin Bieber.

2049
02:06:46,300 --> 02:06:47,260
Well done.

2050
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:49,820
Man, it's not called Shoddy with you.

2051
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:51,600
Shoddy with you.

2052
02:06:51,860 --> 02:06:52,860
Shoddy with you.

2053
02:06:57,180 --> 02:06:58,020
So.

2054
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:02,380
At the end of round two, that brings us to 7-3.

2055
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:08,040
It's going to take quite a lot for Minto to be able to bring
this back, but there is still a chance.

2056
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:11,480
And because of that, I'm going to make the last round.

2057
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:14,300
Double points!

2058
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:16,440
Double points!

2059
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:24,260
So if Minto is able to get some of these, then Minto could
take it at the end.

2060
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:28,840
In fact, why not we do triple points?

2061
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:33,100
All on nothing.

2062
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:35,060
Let's put it all out on the line.

2063
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:36,600
All right, guys.

2064
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:37,160
This is huge.

2065
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:37,940
This is huge.

2066
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:39,040
Triple points.

2067
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:44,380
The last corner today is called.

2068
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:48,880
Can you speak chipmunk?

2069
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:52,820
Can you speak chipmunk?

2070
02:07:53,460 --> 02:07:53,820
Okay.

2071
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:55,560
Can you speak chipmunk?

2072
02:07:55,660 --> 02:08:03,080
So what we're going to be doing is you guys are going to
hear So this is back to the audio thing, so if you guys

2073
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:04,100
could prepare that.

2074
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:10,140
This is going to be various different songs, but very fast.

2075
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:17,540
So there's going to be a hard mode, which will give you
three points, a medium mode, which will give you two points,

2076
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,260
and an easy mode, which will give you one point.

2077
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:24,860
You have to guess what the song is from these.

2078
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,740
We're going to start with the hard mode for the first song.

2079
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:28,500
Are you guys ready?

2080
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:34,420

02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:39,480
Never met someone who thinks much like me.

2089
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:42,120

It's just a bit...

2092
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:45,580
Yeah, it's so weird.

2093
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:49,500
It's fine on my OBS, so I think it might be that YouTube's
having some issues.

2094
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:52,800
I think YouTube may be having some issues.

2095
02:09:54,180 --> 02:09:54,720
Hello.

2096
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:56,960

Oh, yeah.

2109
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:22,320
Is it the Ariana Grande Santa Baby or is there?

2110
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:23,620
Oh gosh, what's her last?

2111
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:24,980
That's just not called.

2112
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:27,240
Santa something.

2113
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:28,720
It is not.

2114
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:31,300
It's not sad to tell me by Ariana Grande.

2115
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:31,720
Oh, okay.

2116
02:11:32,140 --> 02:11:33,760
It's not sad to tell me.

2117
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:38,120
Phoebe, any guesses before we move on to the next one?

2118
02:11:38,160 --> 02:11:40,060
Oh, um...

2119
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:44,000
Oh, maybe it's not Jingle Bells.

2120
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:45,120
Is it Jingle Bells?

2121
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:47,380
It is not Jingle Bells.

2122
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:52,260
So what we're gonna do is we're going to play the medium
version.

2123
02:11:52,540 --> 02:11:52,540
Anyone?

2124
02:11:52,660 --> 02:11:54,020
Some people in chat have got it.

2125
02:11:54,060 --> 02:11:55,060
Some people in chat have got it.

2126
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:55,980
Do not look at chat.

2127
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:56,820
Chat are cheating.

2128
02:11:57,220 --> 02:11:57,240
Okay.

2129
02:11:57,320 --> 02:11:58,360
Okay, here we go.

2130
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:06,980
It's last Christmas!

2131
02:12:07,380 --> 02:12:09,180
It is last Christmas!

2132
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:12,700
So that's two points.

2133
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:13,980
That's two points.

2134
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:18,060
And because it's triple points, you're on nine!

2135
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:23,580
Oh my god!

2136
02:12:24,600 --> 02:12:28,820
Because you got triple points there and you came in at the
medium.

2137
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:36,500
one which is two points already so you get six points which
puts you on nine the tables have turned the tables have

2165
02:17:33,770 --> 02:17:34,330
Hmm...

2166
02:17:34,330 --> 02:17:34,750
Hmm...

2167
02:17:34,750 --> 02:17:35,070
Hmm...

2168
02:17:35,070 --> 02:17:35,490
Hmm...

2169
02:17:36,470 --> 02:17:36,750
Hmm...

2170
02:17:37,030 --> 02:17:38,210
Audio is still cutting.

2171
02:17:38,350 --> 02:17:39,790
It's definitely not getting better.

2172
02:17:40,590 --> 02:17:40,730
Oof.

2173
02:17:41,650 --> 02:17:42,210
Okay.

2174
02:17:43,170 --> 02:17:43,390
Why?

2175
02:17:45,330 --> 02:17:46,830
Can you guys hear us?

2176
02:17:47,930 --> 02:17:50,410
Well, apparently even the loading screen was laggy too.

2177
02:17:50,670 --> 02:17:51,830
Yeah, it looks like it.

2178
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:52,790
It is.

2179
02:17:54,850 --> 02:17:57,530
Not sure why it would do that.

2180
02:17:57,690 --> 02:17:58,530
This is...

2181
02:17:58,530 --> 02:17:59,390
It's not like we're doing...

2182
02:17:59,390 --> 02:18:01,010
Yeah, I'm not sure.

2183
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:14,260
Trying to think of anything.

2184
02:18:17,660 --> 02:18:18,240
Maybe...

2185
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:20,000
Audio jumped, right?

2186
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:24,460
Yeah, the problem is if I refresh, then it'll start a new
thing.

2187
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:26,800
Audio should be better now.

2188
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,920
Well, the audio is better than...

2189
02:18:29,580 --> 02:18:31,080
then... then that's good.

2190
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:37,780
Okay, audio is still cutting out, but music clear.

2191
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:40,640
That is interesting.

2192
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:41,200
Audio is fine.

2193
02:18:41,420 --> 02:18:42,140
Oh, we can hear you.

2194
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:43,060
Audio is clear.

2195
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:43,460
Cool.

2196
02:18:44,140 --> 02:18:44,620
Okay.

2197
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:46,060
Okay, audio is good.

2198
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:48,500
Okay, then let's just finish the quiz part.

2199
02:18:48,620 --> 02:18:50,680
I'm so sorry, guys, for the...

2200
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:52,340
For the issues.

2201
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:55,160
But we'll quickly finish the quiz.

2202
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:56,080
All right.

2203
02:18:56,200 --> 02:18:57,400
It's still been so fun.

2204
02:18:57,520 --> 02:18:59,800
I'm glad you guys are enjoying it.

2205
02:18:59,940 --> 02:19:02,460

2208
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:34,540

2209
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:35,520
Oh, there it is.

2210
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:39,320
So, like, I know I guessed this last time.

2211
02:19:39,580 --> 02:19:40,580
Maybe I'm just...

2212
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:42,440
Hit the jingle bells this time.

2213
02:19:43,380 --> 02:19:43,940

2214
02:19:47,670 --> 02:19:48,410

02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:57,280
Okay, let's just hear the easy...

2216
02:19:57,280 --> 02:19:59,040
Let's hear the easy one.

2217
02:20:00,940 --> 02:20:02,800
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell.

2218
02:20:03,440 --> 02:20:03,460
Oh my god!

2219
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:05,160
Dancing, dancing in jingle bell square.

2220
02:20:05,480 --> 02:20:06,220
In forest, yeah.

2221
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:07,920
But right time, it's right time.

02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:08,680
Rock the night.

2223
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:09,520
Which means...

2224
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:22,640
3 at triple points which means 9 points which means their
favorite is on 16 oh my gosh this is so intense it could go

2225
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:29,600
either way these triple points are crazy man these triple
points are crazy depending on this last the last question

2226
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:36,960

No, what's the clue for?

2230
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:08,620

That's nine whole points for Minto, which means Minto is on
18, which means the winner is, in a shock turn of events,

2235
02:21:55,700 --> 02:21:58,040
Minto!

Oh, by two points.

2237
02:22:02,340 --> 02:22:07,580

the end there.
