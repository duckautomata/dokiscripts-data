00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,470
Welcome back!

2
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,090
Hello!

3
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:24,580
I feel like I'm on a beach vacation with this music.

4
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,600
Is this a chill game?

5
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,260
Is this a chill game?

6
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,370
Guys...

7
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,490
Small Minto.

8
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,370
Today, I'm small.

9
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,510
It's been a while since we've had chibi Minto, so...

10
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,790
Do I have to do the tutorial?

11
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,750
Or will it let me still join?

12
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,450
Do I have to do the tutorial?

13
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,570
What do you mean today in quotes?

14
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,050
What do you mean by that?

15
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,530
Chibi Minto.

16
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,610
What do you mean by that?

17
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,310
Could be useful.

18
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,250
Let me ask.

19
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,470
Should I do the tutorial first?

20
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,490
I'll ask them.

21
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,530
How long is it?

22
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,950
It's optional, but probably useful.

23
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,030
Tutorial speedrun.

24
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,710
The girls will explain?

25
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,510
You think so?

26
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,570
I'm not graduating!

27
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,370
Stop it!

28
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:41,990
Stop!

29
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,610
Small and cute.

30
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,110
Thank you so much for 3-5.

31
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,390
Thank you!

32
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,550
They're not responding to me.

33
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,730
I was actually wondering.

34
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,850
I was like, did I get the time right?

35
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,850
Streaming with...

36
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,330
Collabing with Twitch people is scary.

37
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,810
Because they just like...

38
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,510
Are so...

39
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,130
Relaxed about everything.

40
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,850
They're like...

41
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,370
Oh, Matara said no need.

42
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,350
Limes will explain.

43
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,830
She's very kind like that.

44
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:12,590
Okay.

45
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,290
I love Lime.

46
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,830
She's so nice.

47
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,470
Unlike Matara-kun.

48
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,150
But...

49
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,070
Yeah, it's like...

50
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,070
So strange.

51
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,310
Because they'll be like, oh yeah.

52
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,650
They'll just collab.

53
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,170
And they're already streaming.

54
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,190
And I just started streaming.

55
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,450
But people on Twitch are like, I've been streaming for 5 hours.

56
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,690
And I'm just gonna do a collab.

57
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,930
That's just so strange to me.

58
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,710
That's so strange to me.

59
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,010
I'll give you the rundown, don't worry.

60
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,630
It's my first time also collabing with Cinder.

61
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,550
So I'm a little nervous.

62
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,370
Because she's really pretty.

63
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,570
But she actually...

64
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,250
She...

65
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,410
Asked me.

66
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,270
I was like...

67
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,130
You wanna...

68
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,890
You wanna collab with me?

69
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,770
You wanna...

70
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,230
You wanna...

71
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,890
You wanna collab with me?

72
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,530
That's how I felt.

73
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,650
I was like...

74
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,870
Co...

75
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,510
Co...

76
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,430
Collab...

77
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:26,810
With...

78
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:27,970
Bito?

79
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,330
Or...

80
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:29,830
Soda?

81
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,530
I'm...

82
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,130
I'm...

83
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,350
I'm just a small ghost maid.

84
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,530
Why do I talk like that?

85
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,430
That's how I feel in my soul.

86
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,210
Thank you so much for the gifted!

87
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,110
Wait.

88
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:42,890
Oh my gosh, wait.

89
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,070
I feel like I've missed so many.

90
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,070
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

91
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,430
I'm looking at them at the top.

92
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,010
I heard you're not graduating.

93
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,190
Yeah, I'm not graduating.

94
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,550
I did not pass my classes.

95
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,290
I didn't pass my classes, you guys.

96
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,130
I'm not graduating.

97
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,310
You know how they said C's get degrees?

98
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,770
Well, they lied!

99
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,970
They lied!

100
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,610
Wait, did you see Matara's joke about you in her going live post?

101
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,690
Comedy gold.

102
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,690
Wait, what did she say?

103
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,250
Matara Khan.

104
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,250
What did she say?

105
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,230
In my post?

106
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,830
You guys, I hit 200k on Twitter.

107
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,430
That's craziness.

108
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,850
I replied to it.

109
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,730
Oh, that post.

110
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,190
Tuna, I'm gonna murder you.

111
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,170
No, I'm not gonna murder you.

112
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,290
I'm gonna turn you into sushi.

113
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,030
And then I'm gonna consume you.

114
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,150
And get mercury poison.

115
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,470
I thought you meant on my...

116
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,870
I took a break from social media and now I hear you're graduating.

117
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,190
No!

118
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,570
I'm not graduating, please!

119
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,450
Can we get 200k big booms for the 200k followers on Twitter?

120
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,050
Ok, this might take a while.

121
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,350
Pretty!

122
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,810
Thank you so much for the 50 gifts.

123
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,450
Don't threaten him with a good time.

124
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,890
You're right, you're right, you're right.

125
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:30,750
Ok.

126
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,270
Whoever wants to call first.

127
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:35,710
I'm shy.

128
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,570
I'm shy.

129
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:47,750
Limelight.

130
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,610
Ok, I'm gonna join the call everybody.

131
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,470
I'm gonna join the call.

132
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,110
Oh, everybody is already in but me.

133
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,210
Ok, I'm joining the call.

134
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:56,970
Hi!

135
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,830
Cinder, you're so low for me.

136
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,150
Why?

137
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:06,970
Oh, am I?

138
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,890
Oh, it was... Discord put you at 67%.

139
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,970
How would it do that?

140
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:17,470
Oh no!

141
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,610
Wow, she's got me...

142
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,290
No!

143
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,030
You just met and she already hates you.

144
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,530
I know!

145
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,950
Why did they put you at such an arbitrary number?

146
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,350
I don't get it.

147
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,250
Wait, I don't hear Lime.

148
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,510
Wait, Lime is muted.

149
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,390
Oh my gosh.

150
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,970
Oh, she's got me muted too!

151
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,630
I hate Lime!

152
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,450
Mint, I had you muted and I was sitting there like, why is Mint muted?

153
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,650
And then you had me muted too.

154
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,190
Lime just hates all of us.

155
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,170
No, I've got everybody else unmuted.

156
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:50,990
It's just Mint.

157
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,630
Damn.

158
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,730
It's nice to meet you, Mint.

159
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,770
Nice to meet you.

160
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,870
I'm so excited for today.

161
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,470
I've never played this game.

162
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,590
Nice to meet you too, Mint.

163
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,010
It's been a while.

164
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,470
Yeah, it's been a while.

165
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,910
You're a stranger to me now.

166
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,990
I told them that we had like a nice long talk on Friday?

167
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,470
Or Thursday, I forgot.

168
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,170
When did we have a catch up call?

169
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:20,970
I don't remember.

170
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,790
It was several hours.

171
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:23,490
Yeah.

172
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,310
It was...

173
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,810
Oh, it lasted three hours.

174
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,030
That's short for us.

175
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,490
Damn!

176
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,370
Sometimes you just need some girl talk.

177
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,410
We also haven't really had the chance to talk in a bit.

178
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,890
So, nice to meet you, Mint.

179
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,850
Nice to meet you.

180
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,650
Nice to eat you.

181
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,830
That's my Lime.

182
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,490
I know.

183
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,970
You stole my Lime earlier!

184
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,090
Okay, you just...

185
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,890
Your Lime was calling me not cute.

186
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,250
Like, that's not original.

187
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,850
And you're not original, okay?

188
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,110
You've never been original!

189
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,850
Sorry, Cinder.

190
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,590
For this very embarrassing display.

191
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,110
She can't be professional.

192
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,850
I'm so sorry.

193
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,170
I've never seen the side of her before.

194
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,630
I can be professional.

195
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,270
You started it!

196
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,930
She started it.

197
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,450
She tweeted.

198
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,710
Cinder Lime.

199
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,410
She tweeted instead of collaborating with you girls and Matara.

200
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,230
She started it.

201
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,450
I'm just continuing it.

202
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,550
Drama!

203
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,910
She broke my house in Minecraft.

204
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,850
What?

205
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,770
No, I would never.

206
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,470
She hurt me emotionally.

207
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,970
It's an all out war now.

208
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:37,410
Yeah.

209
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,750
War.

210
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,930
No, war.

211
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,570
Give war a chance.

212
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,230
Give war a chance.

213
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,090
Yeah, so...

214
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,570
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

215
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,670
You'll see repo mint.

216
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,790
I think it'd be easier than lethal.

217
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,070
Yeah, you said that.

218
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,830
I feel like it's easier because the...

219
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,010
I feel like the monsters are less sort of like...

220
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,210
Oh, you got this guy?

221
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:57,690
You die.

222
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,990
There's less of that going on.

223
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,370
There's also very...

224
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,650
There's a lot of opportunities to revive each other.

225
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,190
Which is good.

226
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,490
Oh, okay.

227
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,330
And eventually too...

228
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,530
Yeah, like you said with the monsters.

229
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,750
You can kill a lot of the monsters and you can hide and still escape a lot of the monsters.

230
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:15,950
So...

231
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,390
That was so crazy.

232
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:26,670
Every night before bed I scroll through TikTok and I've been getting repo videos recommended to me that's like tips and tricks on how to defeat this monster.

233
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,950
So you're a pro now.

234
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,550
You're a pro.

235
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,190
We'll see if I can execute any of them.

236
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,910
But yeah.

237
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,150
Okay, I can't wait to watch.

238
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,050
Okay, who's gonna host by the way?

239
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,390
Who's like in the middle?

240
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,210
Is it Manta again?

241
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,430
I think it's, yeah, me or Cinder maybe.

242
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,690
Whatever is easiest.

243
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,190
Let me open repo.

244
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,510
Cinder, do you want to host?

245
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,850
Since you're the one who organized.

246
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,450
Sure.

247
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,390
I'm just launching my game.

248
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,930
Oh, and it's just really silly.

249
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,890
The way the characters look in game it gives you so much serotonin.

250
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,310
Oh, you're gonna love it.

251
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,070
You guys remember the old android mascot?

252
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,550
Like the foes?

253
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,190
Yes, the little green guy!

254
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,830
Yeah, it reminded me of that.

255
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,790
I never had an android.

256
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:17,510
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,250
I had a blackberry into an iPhone.

258
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,970
That's so VTuber USA, Manta.

259
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,090
Wait, wait, wait.

260
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,530
Are we talking about non-iPhones?

261
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,110
That's awesome.

262
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,650
I love that.

263
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,970
Yeah, non-iPhones.

264
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,910
I had an android.

265
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,650
You know what I had?

266
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:40,130
I had this phone called an HTC ChaCha and it had like a physical keyboard and a Facebook button.

267
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,890
And a fucking dedicated Facebook button.

268
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,710
Just in case you really want to go on Facebook.

269
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,170
Who doesn't?

270
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,250
I love seeing AI generated anything on there.

271
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,250
It's really depressing.

272
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,650
The only thing I follow...

273
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,350
I've had a long day.

274
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:04,150
The only thing I follow on Facebook is pet breeders, so specifically the lady I got my ferrets from and then a couple of Pomeranian breeders.

275
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:11,390
Half of the things now recommended to me are Pomeranian or ferret related accounts that just post AI.

276
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:20,710
Some of them even have Pomeranians and ferrets and instead of posting pictures of the actual animals they're posting AI.

277
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:21,570
No!

278
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:21,890
No!

279
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,670
Do they just not realize?

280
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,590
Is it one of those like they don't realize it's AI or?

281
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,950
Oh no, it's like they specifically generated it because they wanted to be like...

282
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,590
They'll do one where it's like, Merry Christmas everybody!

283
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,490
Oh no, this is my favorite.

284
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:42,450
They went, Merry Christmas everybody and then they had like an AI generated image of a Pomeranian with ice skates on an ice rink.

285
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,510
And a few people in the replies were like, So talented!

286
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,070
How did you get it to do this?

287
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,610
I don't want to interrupt but it looks like you're not online on Steam live.

288
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,950
Am I not online or are we not officially friends?

289
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,110
Mint, can you do me a favor?

290
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,530
We've done like 18 million things how are we not friends?

291
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,870
I don't see you!

292
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,050
Oh my god!

293
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,310
I just said my friend code in the chat!

294
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,770
I'm editing you!

295
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,950
Don't listen, we're great friends!

296
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,290
Oh no, we usually play Switch stuff.

297
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,810
Yes, that's why I've sent you an invite.

298
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,850
Mint, can you go...

299
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,410
Am I not getting 18 million friend requests because you just showed it on stream?

300
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,390
Wait, did I?

301
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,670
I don't know, you said nobody saw this.

302
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,590
Oh, are you talking about the fact that...

303
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,950
Okay, for a minute I was like on top of everything else, you just linked my code.

304
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:46,950
Okay...

305
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,550
Huge drama.

306
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,130
Okay, I'll mute in here.

307
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,050
What the?

308
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,170
I think you have to press T.

309
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,810
What was that?

310
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,470
There's text-to-speech.

311
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,930
Press T, Mint.

312
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:09,890
T.

313
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:15,650
T.

314
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,930
T.

315
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,130
T.

316
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:17,730
T.

317
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:34,330
Just for the record, if you die and you guys are together dead, you can also do the text-to-speech chat while you are dead.

318
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,890
Is it also T when you're dead, or...

319
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,390
You sound like little ghosts, it's like little whispers.

320
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,170
Yeah, it is still T to open the chat.

321
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,190
We're laughing a little hard at this.

322
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,490
How's the audio, everybody?

323
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:56,610
How's the audio, everybody?

324
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,450
Soundcheck, soundcheck.

325
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,330
Soundcheck.

326
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,230
Start with Cinder.

327
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,550
Stop laughing at me!

328
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,430
Sorry.

329
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,850
He's making fun of me.

330
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,970
I'm so sorry.

331
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,290
If you could not laugh at Cinder's brand, that would be great.

332
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,870
You're so cute.

333
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,370
Okay, what does the Mataracan say?

334
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,190
I'm gonna eat you.

335
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,050
Mint, you're next.

336
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,590
I'm gonna eat you.

337
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,150
I'm gonna eat you.

338
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,470
What did you say?

339
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,290
I don't know, I guess my thing is like thank you, thank you.

340
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,530
That's my thing.

341
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,150
We'll just combine everybody.

342
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:16,450
Yeah, so thank you, thank you, is what we got so far, I think.

343
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:16,990
I'm gonna eat you.

344
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,510
I'm gonna eat you.

345
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,250
I'm gonna eat you.

346
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:28,130
I also like on these things how the mouth goes more depending on how loud you are.

347
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:38,070
Well, if you ladies are done screaming, we can start our game.

348
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,490
Cinder, I'm sorry.

349
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,930
We lose brain cells being next to one another.

350
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,310
Girl, literally me.

351
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,930
Anytime I'm doing anything.

352
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:51,690
I'm scared.

353
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,890
I volunteered Limes to explain the game to Mint.

354
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,590
That's fine.

355
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,130
I like explaining things.

356
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,450
Okay, here we go.

357
00:18:59,570 --> 00:18:59,770
Hello.

358
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:00,690
Hello.

359
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,610
Okay, Mint.

360
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:11,470
The big things to know are shift to run, the energy refund, or sorry, regen is fucking awful though, so only use it in an emergency.

361
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:20,970
Control to crouch, and you can get under objects if you sprint towards an object and crouch you will slide under the object which is important when running away from things.

362
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,510
Q to go really, really tiny.

363
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,230
In this form you can fit into lots of tiny things and people can also pick you up which is very cute.

364
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,990
You can also...

365
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,010
You have to press Q.

366
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,530
There she goes.

367
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:38,550
Woooo!

368
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,170
Woooo!

369
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,310
It's like she's a ghost!

370
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,050
You can see what it looks like.

371
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,210
Get me out of here.

372
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,330
Okay, there we go.

373
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,970
If you want to pick me up, you can see what it looks like.

374
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:54,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

375
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,710
Hold left click.

376
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,610
Can I throw it?

377
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,030
Minty, did you ever play Half-Life with the gravity gun?

378
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,610
Oh, no I didn't.

379
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,430
Okay, well that's basically what you have.

380
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,470
It's physics based.

381
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,250
You can launch things and move things around.

382
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,430
When you pick stuff up you can use your mouse wheel to move them closer and further away like this.

383
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,910
And then if you right click you can rotate them.

384
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,030
Like this.

385
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,210
Other important things to know...

386
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:37,730
Oh, if you're a Zentraya you need to know if you run and then jump and then press Q, you like tumble into your friends and hurt them.

387
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,370
Also there is...

388
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,870
There is...

389
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,750
It doesn't actually hurt them, but it knocks them.

390
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,890
Nice job.

391
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,490
So you first then jump or what?

392
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,190
Wait, so I run...

393
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,930
Run, jump, Q.

394
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,570
Run, jump, Q.

395
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,010
Do it!

396
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:54,470
Hit me!

397
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,170
First try.

398
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:57,250
Yay!

399
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,190
Yay!

400
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,690
First try.

401
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,170
Other important things to know...

402
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:09,530
I think if you fold down and then use text to speech and then move your cursor around the pitch of the text to speech changes, which is very important.

403
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,650
Oh.

404
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,350
What's the objective?

405
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,270
We're just getting money?

406
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,970
You can also touch her by the way.

407
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:22,150
Yeah, so if you see in the upper right corner we've got zero heads down.

408
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:26,950
Okay.

409
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,170
Sorry.

410
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,110
Okay, so yeah, it's like lethal.

411
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:36,530
We need to get a certain amount of salvage in order to get out.

412
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,450
This is our little cart.

413
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,970
We're going to be taking this around.

414
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,990
It's for holding things.

415
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,630
We need to take our salvage over here.

416
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:52,790
It's a good idea if you can to overstock the salvage, but you don't want to put it all on until you're ready because as soon as you get past the threshold, it will crunch down and take everything.

417
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

418
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:02,110
The big issue is all the items we collect are breakable, so if you damage them, it loses value.

419
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:07,370
Yeah, that's where the physics thing is in, so you have to be careful not to hit each other and objects with stuff.

420
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,030
Some stuff is more delicate than others.

421
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,510
Can I take anything?

422
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,450
If you hold tab, you can see your map.

423
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,890
If you hold tab, you can see your map.

424
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,450
On the map, they come up as little yellow dots.

425
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,870
Try opening the door, Minty.

426
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,110
Try opening the door.

427
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,970
That's not how you open a door, but...

428
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,090
Sorry, I don't know my own strength.

429
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,430
What is that?

430
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,450
That's really unfortunate.

431
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,810
That's one of the hardest enemies in the game.

432
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,410
Well,

433
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,240
I hope Mint enjoyed her first time in the game.

434
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,800
That was fun.

435
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,400
I think he's laughing at us.

436
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,520
Did Cinder survive?

437
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,780
I don't know, but we need to find her next item.

438
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,860
Why did she sound like that?

439
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,660
Cinder, the clone is here.

440
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,200
Be careful.

441
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,700
The clone's coming.

442
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,360
I got him.

443
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,280
I got him.

444
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,220
Why

445
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,680
did I die so fast?

446
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,830
Are they like noise activated?

447
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,570
This is so unfortunate, Mint.

448
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,990
Don't laugh at my body.

449
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,830
Stop it!

450
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,350
Stop it!

451
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,290
Stop laughing at me!

452
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:54,810
That's me.

453
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,590
The crying emoji is me.

454
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,510
It's actually really unlucky.

455
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,150
We got the hardest boss in the game as the first guy.

456
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,370
I'm so sorry.

457
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:03,950
That's okay.

458
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,890
We're going to try to revive you, Aesop.

459
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,910
Aesop, don't hide.

460
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,370
Revive me!

461
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,290
Don't just laugh.

462
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:32,970
What?

463
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,590
What is it?

464
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,850
These are the special items.

465
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,550
Hey guys, while I let the clown away, were you being super productive and getting lots of loot?

466
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,430
Let's try to revive her, Aesop, and get out of here because clown guy.

467
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,130
I'm scared.

468
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,610
Let's grab some more things really quick.

469
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,870
Poor Mint.

470
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,230
Ball!

471
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:04,530
Ball!

472
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,910
There's a text-to-speech system.

473
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,230
I know, I used it.

474
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,250
Hello.

475
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,130
Hello.

476
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,750
Tara is doing her job.

477
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,390
Take you to the supermarket or something?

478
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,730
And you would sit in the cart?

479
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,230
Come sit in my cart, Cinder.

480
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,790
Okay, I will take you on a shopping trip.

481
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:38,410
You have to be careful because the clown will...

482
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,370
The clown will...

483
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,490
You don't want to put that in the cart, Tara?

484
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,010
No, I want to go bring it back because I'm scared he's going to mess it up.

485
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,270
He's going to mess it up.

486
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,650
Right?

487
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,490
Like the clown can just mess things up.

488
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,710
Poor Mint, I want her to play.

489
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,590
Poor Mint.

490
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,790
Can you type yours in?

491
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,470
Why is this so scary sounding?

492
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,330
Wow,

493
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,810
she's missing superchats, you guys.

494
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,490
So am I, though.

495
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,790
Sorry.

496
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,570
I'm not even playing the game.

497
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:19,650
I'm here.

498
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,330
Sad.

499
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:23,810
I'm here.

500
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,350
I didn't even get to play the game for two seconds.

501
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,170
I didn't even get to play for even a second.

502
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:43,070
We only have one area this time around.

503
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,070
What if I...

504
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:50,810
Wait, is it like Little Company where I revive...

505
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,730
After each round?

506
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,030
Hello, Mintle.

507
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,790
Hello.

508
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,690
How's the repo experience?

509
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,950
I'm a passenger princess right now.

510
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,810
I'm so...

511
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,740
Take it.

512
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,280
Oh, they're laughing at us.

513
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,120
Wait, why is my head there?

514
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,720
Yeah, I'm pampered.

515
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,140
You can revive every time, too.

516
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,040
I'm back!

517
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,180
I'm back!

518
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,760
What happened?

519
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,080
Is he?

520
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,180
How do you know he's coming back?

521
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,580
I see him.

522
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,300
He's right here.

523
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,740
Because he's right there!

524
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,240
Hi!

525
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,180
Duck, duck, duck!

526
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,150
I died.

527
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,210
I got to watch you guys play though, so that was fun.

528
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:12,030
In future rounds, Mint, you get to bring the card in several times.

529
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,510
So if you die, we can revive you and then you can still play.

530
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:14,950
Okay.

531
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:16,610
So it's really, really fun.

532
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:21,070
If we meet him again, he can only do his laser beam at one height.

533
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:24,150
So if he starts at an average height because we're standing, just immediately...

534
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,230
Yeah, immediately go down.

535
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,430
If he starts low, jump.

536
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,050
Or get on a box or some shit.

537
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,410
26.

538
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,270
I'm gonna take this strength upgrade.

539
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,590
This is mine, I wanna be strong.

540
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:36,210
Sure.

541
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,190
I don't need it.

542
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:39,970
I don't need it.

543
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,850
Who would hurt me?

544
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,730
I think, okay, so if she gets a health upgrade, she'll have 120 health.

545
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,270
And that will give her 20 more.

546
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,050
So she actually could take this one, it's just as good.

547
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,550
Yeah, cause that way she'll get like 20 bonus to everything.

548
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,230
And she'll need the extra health.

549
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,730
Cinder, would you like a little stamina upgrade, my love?

550
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,590
Sure.

551
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,390
And I will take one too.

552
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,430
I feel like we could always use more stamina.

553
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,370
It's been so long to regen.

554
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,730
You wanna press the button?

555
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,830
We have enough, nice, nice, nice.

556
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,030
Yeah, yeah, you wanna press the button, Mint?

557
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,390
Come here, come here, come here, girl.

558
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,190
I'm pressing.

559
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,610
Push the button, push it, push that button.

560
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,030
Nice.

561
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,350
Oh, what's happening?

562
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,470
Yippee, they're gonna be on the ship.

563
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:25,450
Oh, finally.

564
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,210
Those are our purchases.

565
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:26,810
Hurry!

566
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:27,850
Yay!

567
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,590
You'll see, you'll get the hang of the game pretty quickly.

568
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,710
Okay, I will.

569
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,930
Cause if you stand in the box, it's gonna kill you.

570
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,370
It will?

571
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:35,950
Yup.

572
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,050
Yeah.

573
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,170
You guys have...

574
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,930
They're so nice.

575
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,450
You guys didn't tell me to like do it.

576
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:43,870
You didn't haze me.

577
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,150
It's got a bunch of enzymes.

578
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,610
Oh, we'll haze you, don't worry.

579
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,870
We'll worry, don't worry.

580
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,830
Okay, Mint, take the green box and then press E when you're holding it.

581
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:51,170
Okay.

582
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,710
Yippee!

583
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,910
Yippee!

584
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:58,450
Yippee!

585
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,850
Where are we going now?

586
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,370
Are y'all ready?

587
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,350
We're going to a new place.

588
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:04,410
Taxman.

589
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,810
Oh, Latara Khan.

590
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,050
She's texting.

591
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,450
What are those emojis mean, huh?

592
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,290
Me?

593
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:16,130
Can you send like one of those like thirst emoji sentences to the...

594
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,510
Eggplant.

595
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:17,870
Yeah.

596
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:19,370
Sweaty.

597
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:19,890
Water.

598
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,490
Tongue sticking out.

599
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:22,450
Yeah.

600
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,610
So, very quickly also, Mint.

601
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,630
If you saw on the thingy, I was bringing stuff back here.

602
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,670
Usually we try to bring the big stuff or the stuff that breaks in one hit.

603
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,610
Cause once like enemy, for example, the clown when he used his laser.

604
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,530
If that had hit the cart, the stuff that breaks in one hit would've broke him.

605
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,090
Wow!

606
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:39,770
What?

607
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:41,850
Alex Malico.

608
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,850
Let me grab your neck.

609
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,050
Maybe I should put that on the extraction point because once we...

610
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,070
If we have to pick this up, it's going to break everything.

611
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,390
How do you know what's grabable?

612
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,010
Ok, so I will show you.

613
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:53,410
Come with me.

614
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:53,730
Come with me.

615
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,490
So first of all, click on this door.

616
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:55,690
Yeah.

617
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,910
And I'll open it fully.

618
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:58,510
Yeah.

619
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:58,630
Yeah.

620
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:58,790
Yeah.

621
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:58,910
Yeah.

622
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:58,990
Yeah.

623
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,610
Always try to open the doors to like their fullest.

624
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:01,810
I'm opening.

625
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,190
I'm opening.

626
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,810
Then it's easier to come in and out.

627
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,050
Yep.

628
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,250
Oh, candlelit dinner.

629
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,090
Ok.

630
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:07,790
Oh, Mint.

631
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,010
Mint.

632
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:08,150
Mint.

633
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,290
This diamond will break in one hit.

634
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,330
Oh, ok.

635
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:11,830
Good luck.

636
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:12,730
Careful.

637
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:13,750
I'm careful.

638
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,350
Mint!

639
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,270
Don't drop it.

640
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:18,530
Yeah.

641
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,410
Put it in the cart.

642
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,370
In the cart.

643
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,810
How do I drop it nicely?

644
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,130
Yeah, just put it down a bit and then just let go.

645
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:30,870
Good girl!

646
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,430
Yay!

647
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,990
So if you come here, Mint, you'll see the cart.

648
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,270
It says 3,400.

649
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,010
Oh, yeah.

650
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,310
There's another object on this shelf.

651
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,110
And you can also like carry the cart too.

652
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,530
If you want to try that.

653
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,390
Just get like used to it.

654
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:44,990
It hovers.

655
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:45,930
Nice.

656
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:46,290
Easy.

657
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,030
Another thing here is the lockers.

658
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,930
Like always try to open the lockers.

659
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,890
And also like try to look above.

660
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:52,590
Metal gear.

661
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,050
They might have posters.

662
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,270
They might have posters, yeah.

663
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,350
But always try to open them and jump to see sexy women.

664
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,150
Wives.

665
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,150
Okay.

666
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,110
But yeah, right now it's like fairly easy because it's the early levels.

667
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,670
There's a lot of watches here.

668
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,550
Gotta be careful.

669
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,370
Go pick up some stuff.

670
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,090
Go pick up some stuff.

671
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:10,550
I am.

672
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:10,910
I'm going.

673
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,170
Is there anything else in here?

674
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:13,650
You're doing great.

675
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:14,990
Thanks!

676
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,130
How do you know when to pick something up?

677
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,860
Yeah, there could be men.

678
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,280
What is this thing?

679
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,060
This might be the sexy women in the lockers.

680
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,040
Looks kind of like a chicken.

681
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:29,840
Not gonna lie.

682
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:32,880
Hello?

683
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,180
Math?

684
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,760
Game is horror.

685
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,440
What's that sound?

686
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,620
Why do I hear music?

687
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,040
Hi.

688
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,640
Why do I hear music?

689
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,860
I'm sure it's nothing.

690
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,560
Oh, okay.

691
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Oh, plate.

692
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,180
Oh, oh.

693
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,040
Um...

694
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,500
Sorry.

695
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:01,920
My bad.

696
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,300
My bad.

697
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,520
There's more stuff here.

698
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,200
Oh, guys!

699
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:06,880
Doll!

700
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:06,880
Doll!

701
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,160
Doll!

702
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,460
Doll!

703
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:07,800
Doll!

704
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:07,960
Doll!

705
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,040
Doll!

706
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,240
Doll!

707
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,560
Okay, so do you see the minuses?

708
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,920
That's because she's breaking...

709
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,680
Move the card back.

710
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,220
Move the card back.

711
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:14,500
The doll.

712
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:14,820
The doll.

713
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,080
Backpack back the other way.

714
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:16,420
Oh!

715
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

716
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,680
We'll be back home?

717
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,140
Yeah, as most...

718
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,760
Because if she attacks us...

719
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,080
Actually...

720
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,540
Under the table.

721
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,900
Under the table.

722
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,980
Oh, under the table.

723
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,600
I'm here.

724
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,140
I'm grabbing her, but I don't think I can like...

725
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,380
Oh, can we go back and get that saw blade?

726
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,680
Oh, she's hitting me!

727
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,080
Oh, no!

728
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:33,620
I'm gonna...

729
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,680
Oh, she can reach us under the table.

730
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,320
Oh, she can?

731
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,300
Oh, uh...

732
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,660
I'm gonna take this stuff back.

733
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,580
I'm gonna take this stuff back.

734
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,040
Let's sneak.

735
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:39,920
Let's sneak.

736
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,420
She's screaming.

737
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,380
I got it.

738
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:43,900
I got it.

739
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,200
You got the card?

740
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,490
Okay, I'll be on the lookout...

741
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,340
for anything in our way.

742
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:48,840
Okay.

743
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,840
I got the card.

744
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,220
I'm doing my part.

745
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,120
Alright.

746
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,460
I love how we're whispering.

747
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,520
There are some enemies that are triggered by sound.

748
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,320
I don't know if...

749
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,020
Oh, okay.

750
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,620
And then we'll go back and see if they're alive...

751
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,560
and then we can revive them.

752
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:04,940
Yeah!

753
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,800
They're probably dead.

754
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,920
Of course I'm alive.

755
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,120
What the heck?

756
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,500
Just kidding.

757
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,660
Of course they're alive.

758
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,460
Okay, and then...

759
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,020
I cannot say the same for Matara.

760
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,260
I don't know where Matara is.

761
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:14,620
No.

762
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,060
She better die.

763
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,180
I thought that was her head.

764
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,440
No, I don't know where she is.

765
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,100
I'll go look for her.

766
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,720
Let's go...

767
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:22,900
Yeah.

768
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,240
Matara Khan!

769
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,860
She can't stop talking...

770
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,220
so we'll know if she's alive immediately.

771
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,360
Oh, wait.

772
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,020
You're so right.

773
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,440
Oh, Mata!

774
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,040
Just follow the screams of terror.

775
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,640
No problem.

776
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,300
Mata!

777
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,480
Are you still alive?

778
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,420
Matara Khan!

779
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,700
Guys, I don't hear her.

780
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,480
I don't either.

781
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,640
I hit something behind the whiteboard over here.

782
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,380
Is it still there?

783
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,280
Oh, no!

784
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:53,780
She died?

785
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,220
Oh, really?

786
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,500
She's beheaded.

787
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,110
I'll take you back, Matara.

788
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,350
I'll take you back.

789
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,110
Could you grab these gems?

790
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,190
She's gonna lose a few brain cells on the way home, though.

791
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,190
Wait, I still have her?

792
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:22,530
Oh, yeah.

793
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,410
Come on, Matara.

794
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:23,710
Don't lag.

795
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,690
I want to get enough strength to be able to bludgeon that knife doll to death.

796
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,530
Can I do it with her head?

797
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,950
I don't think she's... I don't think it's a strong enough object, unfortunately.

798
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,690
That would be funny, though.

799
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,330
Like a newborn baby.

800
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:44,130
I want to buy, like, seven upgrades in strength and, like, rip a door off the frame and beat something to death with it.

801
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,730
I feel like a one-shot anatomy.

802
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,570
Should I put her head inside?

803
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,430
Yeah.

804
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,790
We have another extraction point, so we can just do this one now.

805
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,270
Okay.

806
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:01,770
Get her back.

807
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,090
Why is it so liquidy sounding?

808
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:06,570
I don't like it.

809
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,270
It's smooshy.

810
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,030
How do you rip the door off the frame?

811
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:11,370
Strong.

812
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,430
I'm trying.

813
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,550
More strength.

814
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,990
I need more strength.

815
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,730
All of us together can do it!

816
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,290
What's this?

817
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,290
Our money?

818
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,690
It's our excess cash.

819
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,810
Can you grab my neck, blinds, please, deductively?

820
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,630
Can you touch me?

821
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,130
Oh.

822
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,090
A little bit.

823
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,030
Yay!

824
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:35,470
I've been touched.

825
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,110
Thank you.

826
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,270
For once in your life.

827
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,870
Just because I've... Listen, you know what, bitch?

828
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,970
This might be the year I find the love of my life, okay?

829
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,310
I know he's out there.

830
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,630
I know he exists.

831
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,070
Someone wants to get eaten.

832
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,150
Someone wants to get eaten.

833
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,570
Surely that's not just hardcore coping.

834
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,030
No.

835
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,010
Yeah, surely.

836
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,630
Surely not.

837
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,090
Surely.

838
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,250
How would we have killed the Reaper, by the way?

839
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,030
Some folks are saying to throw chairs at them, but you can't pick up the chairs.

840
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,950
So I'm kind of curious how that could have happened.

841
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,470
Wait, we killed it?

842
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,270
No, no, no, no, no.

843
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,850
It's just because they move around the map.

844
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,110
Oh, okay, okay.

845
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,570
But you'll see, like, it's fairly easy to avoid a lot of monsters.

846
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,530
Says the person who died.

847
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,290
I died to the gnomes, okay?

848
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,550
There were little people like me there, and they hurt me.

849
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:30,450
The gnomes!

850
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:35,590
So the gnomes, what they're gonna do is they're gonna run at our treasure, and they're gonna try to break it.

851
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,970
So we need to, like, just take them and throw them at the wall.

852
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:38,850
Little assholes, okay.

853
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,950
Oh, you can grab them, okay.

854
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:41,190
Yeah.

855
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,350
Just like me.

856
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,410
I found a thing!

857
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,510
Extraction point.

858
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,670
It's the door to the left.

859
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,010
Okay.

860
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,010
Door to the left.

861
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:53,190
Oh.

862
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,570
I'll let you in.

863
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,510
I'll hold it up high.

864
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,510
I won't drop it on you.

865
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,090
Don't worry.

866
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,850
You can actually use that to kill the big lady if she shows back up.

867
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:05,990
Watch out.

868
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:06,950
Everybody.

869
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,710
I got a chainsaw.

870
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:14,370
Nice.

871
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,010
Ew, why is it in the bathroom?

872
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,630
Give me something to break!

873
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,530
Give me something to break!

874
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,770
How about your fucking face?

875
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,150
Oh, the toilets can also have stuff in them.

876
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,390
I'm trying to get in.

877
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:34,970
Nothing.

878
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,150
I don't believe her.

879
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,410
Okay, we'll have to come back for this if we find another enemy.

880
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,490
Because this could be useful.

881
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:48,490
Oh my god.

882
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,110
Wait, wait, careful.

883
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:49,690
I have a diamond.

884
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,750
Can I drown?

885
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,190
Or is that not possible?

886
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,710
Are you crouching in the toilet, Mint?

887
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,870
I don't know if this one has a flush.

888
00:38:58,910 --> 00:38:59,250
Hold on.

889
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,670
Oh, it does.

890
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,250
Alright, bye.

891
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,490
Almost died, I think.

892
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,270
Hey buddy, you're fine.

893
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,470
I'm just a little stinkier than before.

894
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,030
What are you doing behind there?

895
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,950
I'm hiding from the... I'm reading also...

896
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,470
Chat is telling me how to kill the clown.

897
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,010
I saw something on the left there.

898
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,290
Be careful.

899
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,630
So I'm just learning how to kill the clown.

900
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,410
I didn't know you could actually open the toilets.

901
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,810
Here, flush me, flush me.

902
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,550
Flush me, flush me.

903
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,610
One second, one second, one second.

904
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,970
I want to make sure she's not coming in here.

905
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,450
Where are you?

906
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,390
I'm in the toilet.

907
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,170
Oh, I hear some issues.

908
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,370
What's going on?

909
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:46,970
How are you in the toilet?

910
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,250
Oh, you're in this toilet.

911
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:49,730
Yeah.

912
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,810
Okay, sorry, you look like you were Limes' color.

913
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,050
Get small, press Q.

914
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:57,870
Okay, hold on.

915
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,030
I'm going to get in the toilet.

916
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,330
No, you can just press Q.

917
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,310
I am.

918
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:03,930
I'm going to haze you.

919
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,330
Oh.

920
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,570
You little bitch.

921
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:06,510
Hold on.

922
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,130
That's what you get for going to Japan without me.

923
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:08,610
What?

924
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,630
Oh, you're going to throw me in?

925
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,790
No, you're going to give me a swirly.

926
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,270
That's what you get.

927
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,630
Why didn't you call me a cute girl?

928
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,290
Okay, okay.

929
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,290
Why didn't you call me a cute girl today, huh?

930
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,090
I can only tell truths.

931
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,230
Okay, okay.

932
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,510
Fine, fine.

933
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,030
You know what?

934
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,210
If you're not going to lie, you're going back into the toilet.

935
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,410
Please, Matoro.

936
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,590
Please, Matoro, please.

937
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:46,470
Oh, gosh.

938
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,510
You kicked me out of the toilet.

939
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,210
Did you get a swirly?

940
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,130
Where's the money, Lebowski?

941
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,190
Where's the money, Leminski?

942
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,850
Where's the money, Leminski?

943
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,750
I feel like I'm going to be...

944
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:00,890
Where's the money, Leminski?

945
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:01,870
This is my home now.

946
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:02,310
Oh, my gosh.

947
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:02,990
Did we break the toilet?

948
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,130
Yeah.

949
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:04,710
Damn.

950
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,210
Where's the money, Leminski?

951
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:07,810
Ouch.

952
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,470
Where's the money?

953
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,330
Can we get five gifted for Cinder right now?

954
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,510
Can we get five gifted for Cinder?

955
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,550
Suddenly, the game is muted.

956
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,590
This is so weird.

957
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,690
That's so crazy.

958
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,790
I don't know what's wrong.

959
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,850
Sorry, chat.

960
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,670
Sorry, chat.

961
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,690
Wait, what can I pick up?

962
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,110
Oh, I can open the door.

963
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:36,330
Where are we going?

964
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,330
Oh, you can open the...

965
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,710
You can also open the...

966
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,290
I'm trying to get in.

967
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:43,630
The doors.

968
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,430
Yeah, I'm in.

969
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,690
Is that a blade?

970
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:50,890
What's that sound?

971
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,270
The monsters can't stop us.

972
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,530
That's the girl, I think.

973
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:53,970
Right?

974
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:54,710
The girl?

975
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,310
Hello.

976
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,030
Hello, little girl.

977
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:58,990
The girl.

978
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,810
Oh, there's a bunch of lockers here.

979
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:02,390
Two to open.

980
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,110
Where are you guys?

981
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,970
Oh, my God.

982
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:04,830
I looked through all those.

983
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,610
You already looked through them?

984
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,050
I think we got everything on the map.

985
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,450
Yeah, I think we got everything.

986
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,870
If you look through them, try to keep at least one door open.

987
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,910
So that way, it tells the other player that you looked through it.

988
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,470
I think they automatically close.

989
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:15,930
Oh, they do?

990
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:16,270
Really?

991
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,210
My monkey!

992
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,590
Can you grab my monkey?

993
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,170
Yeah.

994
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:21,690
Thank you.

995
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:22,450
You're welcome.

996
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,050
Mint, why are you touching me?

997
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,330
My little monkey.

998
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,030
Dance for me, monkey!

999
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,970
Dance for me!

1000
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:37,950
Okay, now Mint, all the monsters respawned, so it's a great idea to run back to the ship.

1001
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,150
If you press tab, it's going to show you where the ship is.

1002
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,990
Oh, I think I remember.

1003
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:47,350
But just in case, once this goes in, you're going to see where the ship is.

1004
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:47,810
Oh, okay.

1005
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,050
So, good luck.

1006
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:49,970
Oh, we're running?

1007
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,030
Oh, see these little gnomes?

1008
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,910
They're going to hit you, so if you got one, just throw it at the wall.

1009
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,350
Oh my god!

1010
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,030
They do damage.

1011
00:42:59,190 --> 00:42:59,910
Thank you.

1012
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:00,290
Sorry.

1013
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,990
Kill gnome, kill gnome.

1014
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,230
Kill Mint, kill Mint.

1015
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,450
That's not me!

1016
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:09,990
Oh, another one.

1017
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,090
Wow, they're aggressive.

1018
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,470
I'm out of stamina.

1019
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,190
I don't think she can get through here.

1020
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:22,650
Oh shit.

1021
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,270
I think I'm dead.

1022
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,160
She was so young!

1023
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,160
I'm getting used to the controls still guys, sorry.

1024
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,820
I'm starting to get used to the controls.

1025
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,520
I think I was holding Q instead of just pressing it.

1026
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,420
I gotta go get Mint's head.

1027
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,120
Get Mint's head.

1028
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,320
Maybe, can you lure the knife lady away?

1029
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:53,800
Do I have what?

1030
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,280
I have a gnome in my hand.

1031
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,860
A gnome in my hand.

1032
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,260
There's like a million of them.

1033
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,160
Million little gnomes.

1034
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,620
Why do they keep populating?

1035
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,180
You're doing your best.

1036
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,920
She's coming after me.

1037
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,820
Oh, nice.

1038
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,100
Distract her.

1039
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,320
Oh fuck, the little gnome.

1040
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,180
Oh wow.

1041
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:21,940
Damn, she ganked.

1042
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,420
She ganked, she ganked.

1043
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,700
Looper, looper, looper.

1044
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,080
Looper around the table.

1045
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,240
Oh there she goes, she's aggro on it.

1046
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,000
Uh-oh.

1047
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,420
Uh-oh, she's...

1048
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,500
They have me.

1049
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,480
Oh my God!

1050
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,480
Oh my God!

1051
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,200
I'm alive!

1052
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,500
She went up my butt.

1053
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,800
She did go up your butt.

1054
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,360
I was hoping she wouldn't chase me that far.

1055
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,000
If they give her time to leave, it'll be alright.

1056
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,880
Unfortunately, I was being chased by gnomes and her.

1057
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,520
Do you see it?

1058
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,940
Oh fuck, I ran back the wrong way.

1059
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,100
Yep.

1060
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,450
There are so many gnomes.

1061
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:25,510
Just run, just run to the ship.

1062
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:26,910
Don't start it, I'm coming.

1063
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,210
I think you can bash him with the head.

1064
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,330
I think you can bash him with the head.

1065
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:32,770
I'm back!

1066
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,810
Wait, I'm alive!

1067
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:34,990
How am I alive?

1068
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,090
Because we brought her back.

1069
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,730
She chased me so far.

1070
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,150
We did it!

1071
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,470
So then you press the envelope.

1072
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:51,450
Guys, apparently we can dive into her when she stops swinging.

1073
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:57,750
How are you enjoying it so far, Mint?

1074
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,130
I like it.

1075
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:00,870
I'm getting used to it.

1076
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,510
You'll see it gets easier and easier.

1077
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:05,910
You'll pick it up so quick.

1078
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:07,990
Taxman.

1079
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,010
Look at all our money!

1080
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:14,990
Alright, we need to kind of save a little bit of money for a gun.

1081
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:16,990
But before that...

1082
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:26,390
I was trained by the blue.

1083
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:30,710
I wish to become even stronger.

1084
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,210
Look at me swinging that thing.

1085
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,790
I think we can do both of us health upgrades if you want.

1086
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,310
Yeah, I'm at 40.

1087
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:44,830
Yeah, because that way this gives you 20 health.

1088
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,030
Don't pay any attention to what I'm doing right now.

1089
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:47,530
Grab the other one.

1090
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:51,410
And Mint, you're going to eat the yellow one.

1091
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,510
Okay, I'll eat the yellow.

1092
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,350
Let's save money for the rest.

1093
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,810
How much health are you guys at, LimesMint?

1094
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:02,350
56.

1095
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:03,670
16.

1096
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:08,630
I think LimesMint would be AFK.

1097
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,010
No, I'm here.

1098
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:11,410
I'm here.

1099
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:11,730
Hello.

1100
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:13,790
What was I doing?

1101
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:14,350
What was I doing?

1102
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:14,810
What am I doing?

1103
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,690
No, I'm just asking how much health you had.

1104
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:19,930
I'm going to do something very illegal.

1105
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:20,770
Don't let Mint look.

1106
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,050
Are you doing the hack?

1107
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:23,430
Yep.

1108
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:24,150
No.

1109
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,430
Are you stealing?

1110
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,450
She steal?

1111
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:33,810
She stole from the store.

1112
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,890
I stole fizzy lifting drinks.

1113
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:40,090
You get nothing.

1114
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,470
Stinder, take the green one.

1115
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:42,470
Mint, take the yellow one.

1116
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:43,290
I'm taking the yellow.

1117
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:47,470
Hold on, but I'm donating some of it to Mint which makes it morally okay.

1118
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,590
It's okay to steal as long as you give to others.

1119
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:55,890
I got stuck donating health to her so now it's all Mint's.

1120
00:47:58,430 --> 00:47:59,630
You gave me some too.

1121
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:00,410
Here, let me give you some back.

1122
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,070
Thank you.

1123
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:01,770
Thank you.

1124
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:03,910
It got sticky for some reason.

1125
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,390
Thank you very much.

1126
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:06,670
Oh yeah, I can give you some.

1127
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:07,110
Hold on.

1128
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:08,450
Crime doesn't pay.

1129
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,090
How do I... Oh, I have to grab your neck.

1130
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,250
Sorry, I started it.

1131
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,910
Yeah, it's like Robin Hood.

1132
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:17,850
It's like a Robin Hood.

1133
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:18,370
Don't worry.

1134
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,430
This one is really fun with the wizards.

1135
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,050
Wizards.

1136
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,150
We love casting spells.

1137
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,330
You can have some spells.

1138
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:29,930
You said it was a money game.

1139
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:31,870
Hello.

1140
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:34,570
No!

1141
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:35,650
No!

1142
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:35,950
Help!

1143
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:36,890
Help!

1144
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:41,230
Again!

1145
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:41,790
Again!

1146
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:44,170
Oh, sorry.

1147
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,310
You have to like keep her there when she's small or she'll get out.

1148
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,990
If she'll get out, you have to like keep her in.

1149
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,630
Why did you say run here?

1150
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:56,050
Zombies.

1151
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:57,010
Oh, shadow play.

1152
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,490
Don't run into her.

1153
00:48:58,650 --> 00:48:59,730
Oh, I'm on.

1154
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:00,350
I'm on.

1155
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,150
Thank you Mint.

1156
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,010
I leave room for my lady.

1157
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,890
We can break these locks with a sledgehammer eventually.

1158
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,470
Oh yeah, I saw some in the first map.

1159
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:14,050
No, the padlocks.

1160
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,970
It's the headmaster.

1161
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:18,790
This looks spooky.

1162
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,870
I don't think I like it in here.

1163
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,230
It's kind of scary in here.

1164
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,850
It's kind of spooky in here.

1165
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,230
It's kind of spooky scary in here.

1166
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:31,750
Hello.

1167
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,830
Jump into the cart and then go small.

1168
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,570
It's like being at a supermarket with your parents.

1169
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:40,270
Yeah, there you go.

1170
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,850
Try slotting medium loot into monsters.

1171
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,250
Interesting.

1172
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:45,550
Thank you.

1173
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:47,150
I'll have to try it out.

1174
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,550
I'm also gonna go hide the...

1175
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:50,830
Woah, there's a giant thing!

1176
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:52,210
Yeah.

1177
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:53,550
Will this break?

1178
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:57,730
It's fragile, just gently lower it into there.

1179
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,650
I'm very nervous.

1180
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:03,670
Very good.

1181
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:08,050
I don't know why I didn't do that because I have the strength upgrade, but you did a great job.

1182
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:11,110
Careful guys, alcohol.

1183
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,430
I can also bring the ball back to base if you have more space.

1184
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:15,690
Why is this...

1185
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,730
Yeah, you take the ball.

1186
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:19,230
I got a shiny cup.

1187
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,030
You're my shiny cup.

1188
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,230
Spell I cup.

1189
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,430
That's very breakable by the way, be careful with it.

1190
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:27,510
Yeah.

1191
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:28,850
Hold on.

1192
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:30,030
Oh god, this is heavy.

1193
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:31,670
I'm gonna drop it.

1194
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:32,650
I can take it, Mata.

1195
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:33,330
I can take it.

1196
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,030
Yeah, if you don't mind.

1197
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:37,710
Okay.

1198
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:44,930
I might take like one strength upgrade after.

1199
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:46,130
What was that?

1200
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:48,590
Oh, what is that?

1201
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:51,610
What is it?

1202
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:52,070
Where are we running?

1203
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:53,010
Who is it?

1204
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:53,330
It's the head.

1205
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,430
Why can't I go inside?

1206
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,830
If he looks at you...

1207
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:01,770
I'm trying to hide!

1208
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:05,570
What did I do wrong?

1209
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:06,790
Oh no!

1210
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:07,710
What happened?

1211
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,230
I was...I was...I got small but then what happened?

1212
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:13,150
I was trying to get under the...

1213
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,610
I was trying to get...I pressed Q.

1214
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:19,310
I pressed Q but it would make me big again.

1215
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:24,370
He jump-scared me.

1216
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,810
He jump-scared you for real?

1217
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:27,930
He came right behind me.

1218
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:28,870
He's coming back, Mata.

1219
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:32,750
I pressed Q but my game kept making me big again.

1220
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:36,330
It's hard.

1221
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:39,990
It's hard to get used to the tackling mechanics.

1222
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,530
You gotta run and then you also jump and then you also press Q.

1223
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,470
It's much fun to spectate.

1224
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,770
You can use the scroll wheel to zoom in.

1225
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:50,750
You can?

1226
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,750
Yeah, you can zoom in on their faces.

1227
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:55,830
Oh, Tara.

1228
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:01,890
Oh my gosh, it's like dynamic camera angles.

1229
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:03,170
Does he have good hearing?

1230
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,710
Her character is a little dirty.

1231
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:06,450
Or is he an old man?

1232
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:06,870
Yeah.

1233
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:08,610
Stinky Matara.

1234
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,510
Is he an old man?

1235
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:14,710
Let's hope they can carry us now.

1236
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,050
Well, I've got you.

1237
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,150
I think she's getting me.

1238
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,090
You're like, oh boy.

1239
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:23,990
Here we go again.

1240
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,570
Oh, Q is ragdoll.

1241
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:29,670
Control is crouch.

1242
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:33,090
There's a lot of stuff still here but we should make another trip maybe.

1243
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:34,870
Yeah, we should just move on.

1244
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,770
Yeah, I'll get used to it eventually.

1245
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:43,930
Be careful because the face kind of went in that direction.

1246
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:48,990
I thought Q was the tiniest and then there's crouch and then there's tiny, tiny.

1247
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:53,730
Yeah, so when you go tiny, I think you kind of fall over.

1248
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,730
The donkey is also around.

1249
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:58,870
So it's hard to move around after that.

1250
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,230
Shit, sorry you stopped.

1251
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:03,530
It's fine, it's fine.

1252
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:04,190
My bad, my bad.

1253
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:07,470
This thing is such a pain in the butt, this giant.

1254
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:10,710
I always want to be close to you, Matara.

1255
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:13,530
That's my girl.

1256
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:14,270
You put it in?

1257
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,550
Yeah.

1258
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:16,050
We're coming down.

1259
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:16,830
Wait, you can't tell?

1260
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,670
Sorry, I'm just nervous.

1261
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:23,670
I'm having a...

1262
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:25,950
What is happening?

1263
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:28,930
I definitely could tell you put it in.

1264
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:30,810
I just...wrong phrase.

1265
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:40,410
Hi Mint.

1266
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:41,310
Hi.

1267
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:42,490
Wait.

1268
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,690
OK, you hang out in the crate with your giant sack of money.

1269
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:46,370
There you go.

1270
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:50,050
OK, I'm still learning the controls.

1271
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:51,390
So I think I get it.

1272
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:53,350
You're doing great, baby.

1273
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,390
Joe Biden, Joe Biden, Joe Biden.

1274
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,310
Back it up, back it up, back it up.

1275
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,170
This is Skull.

1276
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:00,370
Hide under the bench here, if you need to.

1277
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,570
I will see what he's doing.

1278
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:04,030
OK.

1279
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,220
Yeah, for some reason Mata calls him Joe Biden.

1280
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,740
I have one HP.

1281
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,900
Joe Biden, Joe Biden, Joe Biden.

1282
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,520
Joe Mama, Joe Mama, Joe Mama.

1283
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,440
Oh, thanks.

1284
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,160
You're welcome.

1285
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,400
I'm gonna sit here and try and get used to stuff, guys.

1286
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,740
So now I'm ragdolled.

1287
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,660
And then if I press Q again...OK.

1288
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:34,320
Why though?

1289
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,460
I press Q right now and it makes me ragdolled.

1290
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,960
Oh, but it...OK, that's what it is.

1291
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,860
Oh, I get it, I get it, I get it.

1292
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,040
OK.

1293
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,240
OK, you should be good.

1294
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:48,400
Yeah, if you see him, sprint around the corner and slide under something like low, like a desk or something.

1295
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:48,900
OK, OK.

1296
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,280
And then you're usually OK.

1297
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,340
I'm following you, Laimo.

1298
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:54,760
OK.

1299
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,180
Wait, I hear music.

1300
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,400
I hear spooky music.

1301
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,820
It's probably no big deal.

1302
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:00,360
OK.

1303
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,500
I believe you.

1304
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,820
There might be items like up there, but none of us have double jump, though.

1305
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,820
Oh, I'll use this magic wand.

1306
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,240
OK, there's a delicate cup and a big vase.

1307
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,520
I can take the vase.

1308
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:15,580
I'm delicate.

1309
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:16,580
There's a...

1310
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,100
A little lady.

1311
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,760
There's also this if you would prefer not to take the delicate cup.

1312
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,600
What is this?

1313
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:23,760
Oh.

1314
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:24,640
What?

1315
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,360
This potion?

1316
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,920
Oh, I didn't bring it with me?

1317
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:36,800
OK.

1318
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,440
Yeah, we can make a stash of things.

1319
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,260
Sorry.

1320
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,300
Oh!

1321
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,560
It's OK.

1322
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,360
Oh, good.

1323
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,820
It's very, very delicate.

1324
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,200
I break like most of those.

1325
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:01,940
Don't worry about it.

1326
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,880
OK, I'm gonna take the ocarina.

1327
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,420
You can leave it there until we find the cart, maybe.

1328
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:08,880
OK.

1329
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,840
For the extraction.

1330
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,060
Gentle.

1331
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:12,520
Yeah.

1332
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,660
Talking all over everyone's streams, right?

1333
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,020
No, you're good.

1334
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,240
I'm sorry.

1335
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,240
It was an accident.

1336
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:26,860
OK.

1337
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,220
I believe you.

1338
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,980
Sorry, it was an accident.

1339
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,980
OK, let's double team grandma's ashes.

1340
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,960
Grandma's ashes?

1341
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:38,820
Lift it.

1342
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,380
It's heavy.

1343
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:39,760
I'm lifting.

1344
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,360
I'm lifting.

1345
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,140
It will break.

1346
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,640
If it breaks, it's your fault.

1347
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,000
OK, I'm already grandma.

1348
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,460
How can it be my fault?

1349
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,700
You're the ashes?

1350
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,420
Yay, good job.

1351
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,420
You got this.

1352
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,640
We can try to lift the ball in, but...

1353
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,040
Mint, you should touch this.

1354
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,120
Yeah, you should touch it.

1355
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,220
Oh.

1356
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:15,200
Oh my gosh, we're flirting with each other.

1357
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,340
Just a little bit.

1358
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,540
Text-to-speech flirting.

1359
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,120
It's fire here!

1360
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:21,660
Fire!

1361
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:28,200
I love that it's not saying anything about Matara.

1362
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,840
You would've been so alive if the skull was right behind us just then.

1363
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:39,640
That would've been so good.

1364
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,420
Oh, that would've been silly.

1365
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:41,560
Should I put this in here?

1366
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,920
Yeah, it's very delicate.

1367
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:44,740
Be careful with it.

1368
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,980
I almost... I tried to grab it.

1369
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,680
I almost got it.

1370
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,560
Should we start taking it back?

1371
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,640
We have to find the next point.

1372
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,280
OK.

1373
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,820
I don't think this thing is gonna fit in here.

1374
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:09,240
Yeah, let's... I think we should leave the cart here and try to find the next zone.

1375
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,180
Oh, they found it!

1376
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:11,740
They found it!

1377
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,660
Wow, easy peasy.

1378
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,900
Alright, where are you guys?

1379
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:18,400
Hello?

1380
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,840
OK, it's this way.

1381
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,580
I'm following you.

1382
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,260
I'm looking at the map.

1383
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,060
OK, I'm moving very delicately.

1384
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:32,920
I'm moving.

1385
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,380
It didn't make it like a little hard to see.

1386
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,860
Alright, I'm not gonna run into you.

1387
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,740
I might run into you.

1388
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,780
It will be on accident obviously.

1389
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,720
It's like when you... Go hide!

1390
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,140
Go hide!

1391
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:56,380
Go hide!

1392
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,020
Cinder?

1393
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,620
Cinder?

1394
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,580
You just balled up right?

1395
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,140
You're just a little ball right now, right?

1396
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:20,720
Cinder?

1397
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:22,640
Cinder?

1398
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:24,260
Cinder?

1399
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:34,830
Tora?

1400
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:49,120
Joe Biden was here and killed Cinder!

1401
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,360
There's a ducky!

1402
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,080
There's a ducky!

1403
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,960
I touched...

1404
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,360
We should have warned you about the duck.

1405
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,020
Nobody warned me about the duck.

1406
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,140
Yeah, don't touch the duck.

1407
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,540
I don't... OK.

1408
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:17,690
Limes, can you hear me?

1409
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:21,310
I think the big ball died.

1410
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:23,670
The duck, if you're listening, don't touch him.

1411
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:27,470
Even sometimes if you accidentally touch him, you will die.

1412
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:29,690
Because he turns into angry duck.

1413
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:31,770
I'm gonna put your heads back in.

1414
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:33,990
And I'm gonna see what Limes is up to.

1415
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:38,750
From what I can tell, the duck kind of follows where your cursor is pointing.

1416
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:40,290
And he'll try to jump in front of you.

1417
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:42,110
That's so messed up!

1418
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:46,990
Yeah, that's why it's really hard to resist the urge to pet the duck.

1419
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,450
I was trying to yeet him.

1420
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:51,770
I think we can get him killed by the thingy.

1421
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:53,670
Limes, they're both dead.

1422
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,450
And I think we looted the place.

1423
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:57,870
Yeah, they got killed by the duck.

1424
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:00,270
Woohoo!

1425
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:00,890
We're the best!

1426
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:02,270
Let me just...

1427
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:05,310
Oh, they found the ball!

1428
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:06,130
Oh, they saved it!

1429
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,370
Wait, didn't we find another one?

1430
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,350
No, you're right.

1431
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:10,490
That was from the previous thing.

1432
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:10,970
You're right!

1433
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:11,730
They saved it!

1434
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,070
How would we do that?

1435
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:14,590
I know.

1436
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:16,150
Dang.

1437
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,930
Matara said this game is easy.

1438
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,050
Yeah, once you get the hang of it.

1439
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:26,350
Yeah, they're saying that I can bait him to jump...

1440
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,450
Oh fuck, there's the alien tree.

1441
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,830
To be fair, we both had one health.

1442
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:30,970
Oh, so true!

1443
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,150
That's not a bad idea.

1444
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:36,350
Did she just shut the door on him?

1445
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:37,750
Wait, wait, wait.

1446
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:38,530
I wanna kill the duck.

1447
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:40,030
With the way that they told me.

1448
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:42,970
Can I equip myself somewhere that's not...

1449
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:44,010
I think they can bait the duck.

1450
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,210
I'm gonna move the duck.

1451
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:48,610
They said I can try to bait him into a cauldron.

1452
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:49,430
Let me just try.

1453
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:50,730
A cauldron!

1454
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,390
Is he following you?

1455
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:55,330
Did he start following you?

1456
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:57,250
Yeah, yeah.

1457
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:00,270
He is so cute though.

1458
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:01,610
I want him to follow me.

1459
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:03,530
So they said to bait him to jump in with me.

1460
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:05,590
Little nice ducky bath.

1461
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:11,270
Let go.

1462
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,190
He's like, I know what they're up to.

1463
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,010
He knew what you were about.

1464
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,470
I'm gonna start walking back because I am a coward.

1465
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:26,910
Tax return.

1466
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:27,790
Nice!

1467
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:30,330
Hot dog.

1468
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:33,810
Hanging.

1469
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,470
We're gonna be able to buy so much stuff.

1470
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:38,930
I know!

1471
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,830
I'm alive!

1472
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:42,850
Hey girls!

1473
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:45,470
Welcome back.

1474
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:47,050
Now we must run.

1475
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,910
1 HP and a dream.

1476
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:53,730
I hope there's no old men around here.

1477
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:00,130
Oh great.

1478
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:07,290
I forgot about that entire upper section with the bunk bed.

1479
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:08,710
Oh there's a ducky.

1480
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:11,950
What's an alien?

1481
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:18,290
I'm

1482
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:28,820
alive!

1483
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,520
I'm just far away.

1484
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,060
But I'm alive.

1485
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:35,940
Oh, hello.

1486
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:39,740
What's that sound?

1487
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:40,820
What?

1488
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:43,500
I...what?

1489
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,560
How did it get me?

1490
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,360
I didn't touch him!

1491
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:48,800
That was weird.

1492
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:51,940
I pulled you out of his gravity field and he still exploded you.

1493
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,480
What bullshit.

1494
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,080
No way.

1495
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,680
Matara you got this.

1496
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,560
She so got this.

1497
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:02,940
She's got this.

1498
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,000
Sometimes at random attacks?

1499
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:06,800
No way.

1500
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:07,820
Die.

1501
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:08,720
Sit there.

1502
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,980
She gon' die.

1503
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,080
Oh, all of our heads.

1504
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:30,660
Yeah, Matara just needs to get back to the ship.

1505
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:34,120
Will we all be revived if she doesn't get all the heads?

1506
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,200
We don't get the bonus 25 health, but we get revived with one.

1507
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,020
Okay, okay.

1508
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,540
I think she should just go.

1509
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,120
Oh, there it is.

1510
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,540
Yeah, she should be able to get at least one.

1511
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:45,960
At least one person.

1512
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,480
Stay here, I'm gonna go save the others.

1513
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,500
Unless you wanna come with me.

1514
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:51,860
Up to you.

1515
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,400
They're not very far.

1516
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,280
Whatever you prefer.

1517
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:54,860
Okay, I'll help you.

1518
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,560
Do not put their head into the duct.

1519
01:04:59,160 --> 01:04:59,640
If you can.

1520
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,040
I'll go for the...oh fuck.

1521
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,080
So when the alien just...

1522
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,300
Go under the table.

1523
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,240
What table?

1524
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,220
There's no table.

1525
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,320
The table in front where I'm looking.

1526
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:12,940
Oh, I'm leaving.

1527
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,520
I didn't see a table.

1528
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:19,520
I'm blind.

1529
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,040
He can't come in here, right?

1530
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,300
I'm boxing, I'm boxing.

1531
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:30,840
Start the ship!

1532
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:34,300
Wait!

1533
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:45,640
I didn't do it.

1534
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,500
That was so good!

1535
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,320
Oh my god.

1536
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,660
Yeah, I almost killed you.

1537
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:58,440
Start the ship!

1538
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,160
I yelled...

1539
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:05,360
I got so screwed over.

1540
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,960
Like, I rescued Cinder from the alien...

1541
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,380
And then it blew her up anyway.

1542
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,180
I was like, okay, whatever.

1543
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,380
I go strength.

1544
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,120
Okay.

1545
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:16,620
What do I buy?

1546
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:24,140
How much is a gun?

1547
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,260
But what if we get a sword?

1548
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,060
I have one health.

1549
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,180
We have a pan.

1550
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:39,520
Recharge.

1551
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:45,540
And then, once we let the ship go, you just spam E.

1552
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:49,760
I'm gonna let you guys handle all the buying stuff, since I don't know what to do.

1553
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,300
I'm just, I'm observing everybody, I'm observing.

1554
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:58,480
If I get a sword, I'm gonna do this with it.

1555
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,760
Oh my god, Gray Fox, he's really alive.

1556
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,140
Just like you said.

1557
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,020
Just like I said, he truly is alive.

1558
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,420
Mint, get your butt back in the ship.

1559
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:13,880
Mint, press the envelope.

1560
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:19,300
As the ship is taking off, Cinder just keep spamming E into the loading screen until...

1561
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:20,940
I'm pressing it?

1562
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:21,660
Oh there it is.

1563
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,900
I'm spamming, I'm spamming.

1564
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,180
Mint, how much health do you have?

1565
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,120
26.

1566
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,160
Okay, eat this green thing.

1567
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,840
And Limes, I think you also have very little stamina, right?

1568
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:45,240
Pick it.

1569
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:46,180
40.

1570
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:50,480
Listen, I may not be able to go for very long, but I'm big.

1571
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,740
Don't worry about it.

1572
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,260
You're strong and muscular and sexy.

1573
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,460
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1574
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:56,980
Look at those muscles.

1575
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,800
What's wrong with E?

1576
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:05,620
So, Limes, people are saying with strength upgrades, you can toss enemies into pits or smash them around.

1577
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,220
What enemies could she do that with just two?

1578
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,220
What are the enemies that it works with?

1579
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,960
Okay, I'm just warning you, Mint.

1580
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:17,940
If you see a grandpa that is blind, he will shoot everything that he hears.

1581
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:18,620
So just duck.

1582
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:19,840
He won't be able to see you.

1583
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:20,240
Okay.

1584
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:22,640
And don't use your mic.

1585
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:24,860
I found an eyeball.

1586
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:25,940
Oh shit, sorry.

1587
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:29,620
Is there a grandpa here?

1588
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:32,580
He just tends to be, I don't know, but he tends to be in this house.

1589
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,560
Grandpa's house.

1590
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,800
We're looting grandpa's house, so yeah.

1591
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,600
It's kind of dank and musty in here.

1592
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,980
Yeah, I get that a lot.

1593
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:42,760
There's Minecraft in here.

1594
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:43,900
Girl!

1595
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,840
I wanted to be able to pick that up, but it didn't let me.

1596
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,480
You're so powerful.

1597
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,900
Musty and crusty.

1598
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,540
Yeah, I say that to her all the time.

1599
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:57,400
According to Mint.

1600
01:08:58,980 --> 01:08:59,940
According to Mint.

1601
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:02,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1602
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1603
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:05,660
Dusty.

1604
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,440
That's the Matara con.

1605
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:12,420
Dusty, crusty, musty.

1606
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,200
I got a thing.

1607
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:22,190
Oh shit.

1608
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:22,650
Sorry.

1609
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:23,410
Hello.

1610
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:25,310
Did you just drop your thing?

1611
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:26,690
No, I'm okay.

1612
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:27,210
I've got it.

1613
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:27,690
I've got it.

1614
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:28,090
Okay.

1615
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:28,650
Okay.

1616
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:38,390
What Matara didn't tell you is if the shotgun guy does show up, you can't move quickly and you can't use your mic.

1617
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:39,790
He's very sound sensitive.

1618
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:40,410
Okay, okay.

1619
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:41,170
You can't move.

1620
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:41,370
Okay.

1621
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:42,390
She was like, just duh.

1622
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:43,550
Okay, so that's not the only thing.

1623
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:45,010
I know.

1624
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:46,170
I have a cup.

1625
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:48,550
Radioactive.

1626
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:49,250
Hey, Mata.

1627
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:53,710
Mint, your laughter sounds like those children laughing in horror movies to freak people out.

1628
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:55,030
Yeah, yeah.

1629
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:56,110
I was hearing it.

1630
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:57,370
I'm like, oh my God.

1631
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,990
I am a ghost after all.

1632
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:07,450
I have to sound a little creepy.

1633
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:08,950
I am spooky scary.

1634
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:11,610
I'm like what people say about me.

1635
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:13,550
Right, guys.

1636
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:14,450
Perfect ghost.

1637
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:16,790
She's scary.

1638
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:17,650
Scary.

1639
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:19,250
What is this?

1640
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:22,630
Is this a fridge?

1641
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:23,830
Uh-oh.

1642
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:28,250
I don't like the music.

1643
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,770
I don't like the music.

1644
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,150
What do I do?

1645
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,150
What do we have?

1646
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:43,530
Okay, Mint.

1647
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:51,750
If you see a creepy like black shadowy figure with a baby face mask, try not to look at it and try to get underneath something.

1648
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:52,410
Okay.

1649
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:54,450
The baby, there's like two of them.

1650
01:10:54,510 --> 01:11:00,250
There's a big one who I think is about getting away from him and then there's like a little baby one who's definitely like don't look at it.

1651
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:01,930
Yeah, there's a tall one.

1652
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,350
So don't look at the baby.

1653
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:05,350
Get under the table and don't look at the baby.

1654
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:08,410
How

1655
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:24,170
the fuck did you not die?

1656
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:25,970
How did you die?

1657
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:26,330
Oh, yeah.

1658
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:28,790
And I stole that health upgrade.

1659
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:30,590
It was for a hundred health.

1660
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:33,050
And he shoot for a hundred health.

1661
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,310
And now I just have one.

1662
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:38,630
You can only...

1663
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:44,770
You can only play this game on one HP, Cinder.

1664
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,030
You're playing on hard mode.

1665
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,540
She's gonna get shot.

1666
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:11,210
Are we safe?

1667
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:14,070
We're never really safe, are we?

1668
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:17,930
I don't know how we're gonna get that clock out with grandpa patrolling.

1669
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:23,090
I'll tank one bullet, you think I can tank another one?

1670
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:24,830
I don't think so.

1671
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:25,650
I think yeah.

1672
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:35,060
I like how you just stand there.

1673
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,560
Cinder's so brave.

1674
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:43,390
Alright, let's go.

1675
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,800
He went down the hallway straight down there.

1676
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:55,100
So I think we might be able to grab the clock.

1677
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,400
Easy, careful.

1678
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:04,780
Easy does it.

1679
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,140
Easy does it.

1680
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:06,880
Careful.

1681
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,440
Oh my god.

1682
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,200
Are you kidding me?

1683
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,020
I'm the old man, guys.

1684
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:28,950
How'd they do that?

1685
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:36,270
Oh, that was you.

1686
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:37,710
I thought the grandpa killed me.

1687
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:41,850
Well, it did feel like I was getting shot.

1688
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:46,110
Okay, we haven't gone in here.

1689
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,150
Spooky attic.

1690
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:50,350
I think he's upstairs.

1691
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:52,410
I don't think he went up there.

1692
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:55,150
Hold on, there's something here.

1693
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:56,950
Cash money?

1694
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:58,210
Oh, it's only $600.

1695
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:00,610
Look at her.

1696
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:02,310
She thinks she's better than $600.

1697
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:07,490
I mean, I grabbed two balls worth thousands of dollars.

1698
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:11,890
Yeah, my breasts.

1699
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:21,150
Sorry, that was not my greatest joke I've ever made.

1700
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:22,590
No.

1701
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:27,610
But it will be funny if I ever do get my breasts.

1702
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,090
At least you feel, oh, I missed the ball.

1703
01:14:30,330 --> 01:14:31,610
Oh my gosh, how did I miss that?

1704
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:32,770
Yeah, you gotta like go up.

1705
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:34,610
Always try to like go up and look around.

1706
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,770
Oh, you gotta go up where?

1707
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:38,730
Like, for example, look here.

1708
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:39,930
See, there's also like here.

1709
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:41,650
You gotta open every door.

1710
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:42,410
I missed that.

1711
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:43,530
Oh, I didn't see this.

1712
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:44,150
Oh my gosh.

1713
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:45,010
It's because you're small.

1714
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:45,910
You didn't think to jump.

1715
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:47,470
You're not used to looking up at things.

1716
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:48,890
That's actually true.

1717
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:52,790
Gamers don't look up.

1718
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:55,950
I felt very cute when you were like, can you get me that cup?

1719
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:58,070
I'm like, yeah, I got you, poopy.

1720
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:00,850
I got you, baby.

1721
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:02,250
Let's leave the car here.

1722
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:05,470
And then let's explore because that way we'll have an easier exploration.

1723
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:07,590
He normally goes down this hallway.

1724
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:09,730
How do you know?

1725
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:11,210
Because I've watched his movements.

1726
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:12,450
I'm a grandpa observer.

1727
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:18,320
Hello.

1728
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:19,440
Goodbye.

1729
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:27,520
It was nice knowing you.

1730
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:28,880
Yeah, see you later.

1731
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,600
When you say goodbye and then you end up going in the same direction.

1732
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,120
Well, the door just shut.

1733
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:38,980
I don't know why.

1734
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:41,100
I found the next extract point.

1735
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,700
Oh, nice.

1736
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:44,880
She's gaming.

1737
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:46,440
Also the fridge, you can open it.

1738
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,980
Yeah, I did it earlier.

1739
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,300
And the freezer.

1740
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,620
I know you're short, but yeah.

1741
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,020
I got it, I got it.

1742
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:55,340
I know...

1743
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:56,160
Everything.

1744
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:56,840
Big item.

1745
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:58,820
Yeah, you do.

1746
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,440
What?

1747
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:05,040
What's rough?

1748
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:06,660
What's wrong?

1749
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:08,860
What's wrong?

1750
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:11,520
What's wrong?

1751
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,620
What's wrong?

1752
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,680
Oh, we got this.

1753
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,360
I'm searching everywhere, guys.

1754
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:25,300
There's like nothing here.

1755
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:27,160
There's nothing there.

1756
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,160
Does this go to the bathroom?

1757
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,360
Is this a looping point?

1758
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,020
Yes, it is.

1759
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:33,400
Yeah.

1760
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:37,640
I'm here.

1761
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:40,580
So, Steve, for example, there's this item, right?

1762
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:43,140
There's no point bringing it all the way back to the cart.

1763
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:45,500
But we can just bring it to the next extraction point.

1764
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:46,120
Right.

1765
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:47,220
Which is very close.

1766
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,920
And then once we get the next...

1767
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,060
So, come here, come here.

1768
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:51,560
It's gonna be down these stairs.

1769
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:53,800
I'm moving.

1770
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:55,620
She's moving.

1771
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:56,900
So, it's gonna be down these stairs.

1772
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,760
And then as soon as we do...

1773
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:02,100
If you look up top right, it says 7500 on 15000.

1774
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:02,680
Yeah.

1775
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:05,920
And then as soon as we finish one extraction point, we press this one.

1776
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:06,600
Okay.

1777
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:12,580
With the harder levels, it's sometimes nice to leave one of the points that's sort of next to the exit.

1778
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,780
So that we have an easier time running back.

1779
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,200
Because all the monsters respawn.

1780
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:20,320
I didn't realize you could choose which extraction point to start with.

1781
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:20,720
Oh.

1782
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:25,740
So, for example, there's something to be said about not picking the third one as our last lap.

1783
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,020
Ah, yeah.

1784
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,820
You've got a game here.

1785
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:31,560
Ah!

1786
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,050
Yeah, I'm alive.

1787
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:43,150
I'm alive, but...

1788
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,310
I think we can grab him.

1789
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:51,490
Try pressing him to see if we can grab him.

1790
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:51,850
Okay, wait.

1791
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:54,010
I don't think we can grab him just the two of us.

1792
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:54,810
Maybe we can.

1793
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:58,750
That's them doing one of the thingies.

1794
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:00,690
Let's wait for them.

1795
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:01,370
Yeah.

1796
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:02,750
We're trapped here!

1797
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:07,110
I think for the spider, we need to be both of us.

1798
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:11,030
Let me talk to Lime about...

1799
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:13,310
Leaving this one maybe for the last extraction.

1800
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:14,430
Otherwise, we will die.

1801
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:15,950
We will die.

1802
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:17,830
We will die.

1803
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:20,030
What the heck?

1804
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:20,570
Where did that come from?

1805
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,210
There's also the no face.

1806
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:22,030
Right?

1807
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:22,670
It was on top.

1808
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:24,250
That's why you gotta look on top of the shelf, Spooky.

1809
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:25,730
What the...

1810
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:26,250
Okay.

1811
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:28,150
I wish there was like a scanner.

1812
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:45,440
She just dodged.

1813
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:50,040
I wish I could jinx her.

1814
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,280
I wish I could sabotage her.

1815
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,940
That guy came out of nowhere!

1816
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,100
He came out of nowhere!

1817
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:06,080
I think I will probably die every single round of this game.

1818
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,400
Where is Lime hiding from?

1819
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,660
Where is everybody hiding from?

1820
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,880
Everybody is hiding from something!

1821
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,420
Everybody is around the grandpa.

1822
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:26,200
A body is up there.

1823
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:29,820
She said dumb?

1824
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:43,220
The speeder!

1825
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,240
My head is stuck.

1826
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,140
Wait, my head is actually stuck.

1827
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:58,240
Guys, you can't help it.

1828
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,540
I'm just too big brained.

1829
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:01,860
Big head.

1830
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:02,620
Big head.

1831
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,720
Everybody make fun of Minko with a huge head.

1832
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:07,900
You'll get the hang of it.

1833
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,280
Yeah, this is my first time playing ever, ever, ever.

1834
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:13,680
Sorry guys, if I'm a little stinky.

1835
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:16,880
Big noggin.

1836
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,980
Are you guys having fun?

1837
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,300
Are you guys...

1838
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:22,660
Lime!

1839
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:24,480
Oh, hi!

1840
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:26,920
So Lime, there's an extraction point down here.

1841
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,780
But I think we should keep it until the end.

1842
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:32,460
Because there's grandpa, there's no face, there's spider, there's so many people.

1843
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,500
Let's keep that one then.

1844
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:38,580
Yeah, but I mean, let's try to keep this closer point for the last point.

1845
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:39,940
That way we have an easier way back.

1846
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:41,660
I'll try to find it.

1847
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,760
I'll try to find the other one right now.

1848
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:50,100
What do you want me to say in the chat?

1849
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:52,040
What do you want me to say?

1850
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,420
Okay, good, good, good.

1851
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,440
Don't press this button.

1852
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,160
But we can grab Minko's head because we're going to bring her to the next extraction.

1853
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:58,780
I know, right?

1854
01:20:58,820 --> 01:20:59,280
They're Tokyo.

1855
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:00,640
I was worried about you.

1856
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:02,520
She's so cute.

1857
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:04,500
There's also a really big heart.

1858
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,500
Limes, since you have strength...

1859
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:13,100
Since you have strength Limes, you can try bringing the heart while I look for the next extraction point.

1860
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:15,500
The heart is right here.

1861
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,900
Was that grandpa?

1862
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,160
Something else just appeared.

1863
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:26,580
Oh, that was Matara.

1864
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:29,000
It was the grandma, not the grandpa.

1865
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,640
This guy is so silent.

1866
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:37,380
Oh my gosh.

1867
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:44,280
She's hiding in the fridge.

1868
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:45,340
What does she think she is?

1869
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:45,780
A snack?

1870
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:50,740
What was this?

1871
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:57,300
No,

1872
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:01,420
she's a whole meal.

1873
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,480
She's the appetizer.

1874
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,380
She's the main course.

1875
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,580
She's the dessert.

1876
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:11,280
She's the palate cleanser.

1877
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,700
I feel so old when I hear that.

1878
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:22,120
I don't even know what that is.

1879
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,180
What is that?

1880
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:26,440
I know what a roflcopter is.

1881
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:29,980
Everyone is so quiet.

1882
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,100
It's easy for me to talk.

1883
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:35,240
Look at my eyeballs.

1884
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:36,960
They look like boba.

1885
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:37,820
Yummy.

1886
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:37,920
Yummy.

1887
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,200
Microsoft Sam.

1888
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,080
You get the real, true POV here, guys.

1889
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:51,920
You get every POV from Mito.

1890
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,340
She uses her map so much.

1891
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,480
She holds it so close to her face.

1892
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,680
Can't read.

1893
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:09,300
Nice.

1894
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:15,120
Real ghost POV.

1895
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,100
I'm haunting everybody.

1896
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,400
I gotta look up more.

1897
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:19,620
I really don't look up much.

1898
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:20,820
And that's actually true.

1899
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:29,260
If I'm hanging out with friends, I just don't look up.

1900
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:34,560
Maybe that's rude when I'm talking to them.

1901
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:35,840
I don't wanna hurt my neck.

1902
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,860
Gamers never look up.

1903
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:38,440
It's true.

1904
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:41,840
Real gamers don't look up.

1905
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:42,720
That's what I'm saying.

1906
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:45,460
I'm a gamer.

1907
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:49,080
So you stare at her.

1908
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:51,820
I'm in hell.

1909
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,240
I'm in hell.

1910
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:55,740
Source?

1911
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,440
I would know.

1912
01:23:59,120 --> 01:23:59,720
Source?

1913
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:01,820
Look at him.

1914
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:02,660
Little guy.

1915
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:09,460
Looks just like you, Matara.

1916
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,340
You know what they say about big boobs.

1917
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,620
Big nose.

1918
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,680
And big feet.

1919
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,860
Why is she still talking about me?

1920
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,180
Why are you so obsessed with me?

1921
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:41,500
Why are you so obsessed with me?

1922
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:42,620
Do we have fart time?

1923
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:43,920
Wait, I wonder what it says.

1924
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:51,200
Wait, why is she...what's there?

1925
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:54,880
Oh my shit.

1926
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:55,300
Sorry.

1927
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:02,220
I thought...I think I just saw Matara getting killed.

1928
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,240
We might have done that a little too soon.

1929
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:12,000
It should be fine.

1930
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,920
The cart has another 10k or 7k in it or something.

1931
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,120
We put this in the cart.

1932
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,600
We wheel the cart to the other extraction point and we're good.

1933
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,420
The spider just ran past.

1934
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:22,680
If he comes in here...

1935
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:26,020
If the big spider thing comes in here, we're all gonna want to hold him.

1936
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,460
No, we grab him.

1937
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,500
Grab him, lift him up and down.

1938
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:30,600
I'll try and count for timing.

1939
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,180
And if we do it right, we slam him and he dies.

1940
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:37,320
Motherfucker.

1941
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,640
I don't know where we are, so I'll trust in her.

1942
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:48,160
I need the cart, because there is...

1943
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,620
She's alive!

1944
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:54,270
Spider's here.

1945
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:55,490
The extraction point's done.

1946
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:56,370
We need the other one now.

1947
01:25:59,970 --> 01:26:00,330
Spider?

1948
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:00,690
Sorry.

1949
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:03,090
There's also a little wad of money.

1950
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:04,990
And there's the doll earning.

1951
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:07,230
But I don't think we should do it, because she makes a sound.

1952
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:09,110
Unless we have the cart right here.

1953
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:11,550
No, I need to go... I can go get the cart.

1954
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,350
Where are we?

1955
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:48,990
Okay, that was BS.

1956
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:50,170
That was BS.

1957
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:50,870
That was so bull.

1958
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:52,890
How did Lime live?

1959
01:26:58,260 --> 01:26:59,340
He came in real.

1960
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:00,140
I'm dead.

1961
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:00,540
I'm dead.

1962
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:01,540
There's no coming around.

1963
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,880
We probably would've been fine if we didn't...

1964
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:06,100
That's so unfortunate.

1965
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,060
You got this, Matoro!

1966
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:11,720
Oh, she's being sneaky.

1967
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:13,120
Lime.

1968
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:14,760
Lime is both being sneaky.

1969
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,240
A man and his dog spider.

1970
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:25,340
Get him, boy!

1971
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,700
We need to old yeller this spider.

1972
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,400
I was so ready to grab him too.

1973
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,500
Yeah, I tried.

1974
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,260
I was like, oh, I'm gonna grab him and I died immediately.

1975
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:40,960
I was like, okay, Lime, one, two.

1976
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:47,950
They're whispering.

1977
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,040
They got this.

1978
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,080
They just have to do one more.

1979
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,700
Yeah, and then get back.

1980
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,320
Yeah, oh yeah, I forgot about that part.

1981
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:03,020
I've never seen this many monsters in one level.

1982
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:03,680
Really?

1983
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,340
I don't think I ever got this far.

1984
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:13,620
Dang, there's three extraction points instead of just two this time?

1985
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:14,540
We're getting fancy.

1986
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:15,120
I know.

1987
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:16,720
Wait, there's only two monsters, right?

1988
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,240
There's the old guy and the spider, but then there's also...

1989
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:23,700
It's like a baby.

1990
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:24,620
It sounds like a baby.

1991
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,380
It's like a kid laughing.

1992
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:28,000
I didn't see the baby.

1993
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,440
It's like a tall, shadowy figure.

1994
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,520
And if you look at it, it'll get you.

1995
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,320
Oh, that's right.

1996
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:39,380
I think there's usually two of them that spawn together, so...

1997
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:42,020
It's like, you count them all up and it's a lot.

1998
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:45,900
It is a lot.

1999
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:49,920
Martha almost got blasted again.

2000
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:51,740
Did she?

2001
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:55,180
Yeah, the bookcase was in the way.

2002
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:56,620
Lucky.

2003
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:58,200
Lucky ducky.

2004
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,000
Where's the last extraction point?

2005
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:07,560
The guy is coming up the stairs behind her.

2006
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:11,600
I just saw him walk up the stairs.

2007
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,040
He's in the hallway behind her!

2008
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:15,540
Oh my god.

2009
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:17,100
It's her!

2010
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:17,820
It's her!

2011
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:18,340
It's her!

2012
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:19,020
Oh no!

2013
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:19,740
Oh no!

2014
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:20,180
Oh no!

2015
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:27,840
It's a good thing he swore.

2016
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:28,960
I know, right?

2017
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:30,860
She doesn't know.

2018
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:31,740
She doesn't know.

2019
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:40,160
Do you want to be greedy with it?

2020
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:41,200
Greedy!

2021
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:41,980
There's two dead people!

2022
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:42,900
We should get their heads.

2023
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:44,040
We should get their heads.

2024
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:46,080
He fell down the stairs!

2025
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:47,880
Grandpa fell down the stairs!

2026
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:57,460
Grandpa!

2027
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,280
That's why you need to use your cave instead of the gun!

2028
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:05,340
He just walked back up though.

2029
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:05,800
Wow.

2030
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:09,080
They got so lucky!

2031
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:10,100
Right?

2032
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:15,420
I mean in theory we could keep luring him down here and he'd keep falling down those flushing stairs.

2033
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:21,340
And what do you want to do?

2034
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,940
Do you want to just load this in and finish it up?

2035
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,820
They just need to keep talking and he'll keep falling down the stairs.

2036
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:43,660
Holy shit, we need to repeatedly bait him into falling down the stairs.

2037
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:59,080
It's like those video compilations where people are just like...

2038
01:30:59,080 --> 01:30:59,520
It is!

2039
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:09,120
He's going to fall down again.

2040
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:11,380
Well that was my point.

2041
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:15,320
Do we want to just go back to the ship and just deal with them being at one health?

2042
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:19,240
Because getting their heads and coming back with him camping that whole way is going to be hard.

2043
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,660
You can start going to the ship if you want and I'll wait like five minutes.

2044
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:26,340
I'll wait like two minutes and I'll put it in.

2045
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:26,620
Okay?

2046
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:28,540
Goodness me.

2047
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,940
You have two minutes girl, get excited!

2048
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:34,620
Okay.

2049
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:39,100
Oh gosh.

2050
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:42,080
She's still laughing down there.

2051
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,120
I don't know how I stayed quiet throughout that.

2052
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:49,080
Oh my goodness.

2053
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:49,360
I know.

2054
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,020
I would mute my mic.

2055
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,340
I would have to mute my mic.

2056
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:57,080
That was so good.

2057
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:57,800
Grandpa.

2058
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,200
Come on grandpa, let's get you to bed.

2059
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,360
Oops, fell down again.

2060
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,620
Oops, fell down again.

2061
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,120
My hip!

2062
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,740
My other hip!

2063
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:16,040
Where did these stairs get here?

2064
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:23,240
I bet he didn't see that one coming.

2065
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,460
Oh yeah, take him down!

2066
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:27,860
Dad!

2067
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:33,140
I love how Matz is just standing in the corner.

2068
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:34,520
Is that what she's doing?

2069
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:36,240
Oh my god.

2070
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,040
Matar...

2071
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:41,880
She's counting.

2072
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,080
It's really hard for her.

2073
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:44,160
She's got to concentrate.

2074
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:46,000
She's got to focus.

2075
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:47,980
Yeah, she's really got to focus.

2076
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:51,460
What comes after...

2077
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:55,500
Can only count...

2078
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,640
Where is Limel hiding from?

2079
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:05,660
How how?

2080
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:06,680
I

2081
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:11,060
can't see.

2082
01:33:21,650 --> 01:33:23,870
I can't tell where she's hiding from.

2083
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:25,330
Maybe just to be safe.

2084
01:33:28,890 --> 01:33:29,910
What's the plan?

2085
01:33:29,990 --> 01:33:31,290
I actually don't know what's going on.

2086
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:33,750
So, I'm sent up to the ship.

2087
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:35,770
And...

2088
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:38,430
Matara is getting the last...

2089
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:38,870
What's that sound?

2090
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:39,970
Because when...

2091
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:40,350
Oh!

2092
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:42,010
That was the extraction.

2093
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:42,850
Oh, okay, okay.

2094
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:45,490
Yeah, when you get the last one, the monster is kind of...

2095
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:46,370
They aggro, right?

2096
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:47,150
A little more aggressive.

2097
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:51,410
Okay, I'm so scared.

2098
01:33:51,490 --> 01:33:52,650
I'm sorry I was being quiet.

2099
01:33:58,330 --> 01:33:58,730
Valid.

2100
01:33:59,610 --> 01:34:00,010
Valid.

2101
01:34:02,630 --> 01:34:03,990
It's so dark.

2102
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:08,910
It's funny how she's like almost always yapping and now she just...

2103
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:09,210
I know.

2104
01:34:09,230 --> 01:34:10,870
Her character model looks so scary.

2105
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:16,290
Pardon my language.

2106
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:24,670
Oh my gosh, how are you supposed to see?

2107
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:25,670
Oh my god, he's right there.

2108
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:31,810
The way he uses his gun as a cane is crazy.

2109
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:32,630
Right?

2110
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:35,350
I'm taking notes.

2111
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:37,590
Like a metal grandpa.

2112
01:34:38,150 --> 01:34:41,550
Alright, you got this, Matara.

2113
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:46,070
Oh no!

2114
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:48,330
She dodged the bullet!

2115
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:51,390
She literally dodged the bullet!

2116
01:34:51,390 --> 01:34:51,450
What?

2117
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:56,380
Oh my god.

2118
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:57,340
She...

2119
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:58,600
Oh my god, the moves.

2120
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,580
Okay, she's popping off.

2121
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:02,040
Yeah.

2122
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:08,800
Where's the baby?

2123
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,420
What's it hearing?

2124
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:16,320
Probably the little spider guy.

2125
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:23,960
Matara, choose the rest of the monsters for me.

2126
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,060
Friendly fire?

2127
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,220
Come on.

2128
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:33,220
Limes is leaving!

2129
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:33,940
No way!

2130
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:35,420
She probably thinks Mata is dead by now.

2131
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:38,200
I should've stayed on the ship!

2132
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:41,720
Wait, I'm right here!

2133
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:57,280
Oh my god, I had the grandpa and then the spider ran in.

2134
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:59,140
We saw you juke that thing!

2135
01:35:59,200 --> 01:35:59,820
That was crazy!

2136
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:01,700
You gave!

2137
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:02,380
You gave!

2138
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:05,660
64,000 money!

2139
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:07,080
Money!

2140
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:13,460
The spider chased me back to the ship and I kind of had to throw him into a corner and continue running.

2141
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:14,660
What's the dice?

2142
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:16,600
I opt for strength.

2143
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:20,400
I think with one more strength I can actually toss him up and down by myself, so I want that.

2144
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:20,900
Yeah!

2145
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:21,440
Grab it!

2146
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:21,800
Grab it!

2147
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:22,240
Grab it!

2148
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,820
I'm gonna spin him around.

2149
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:28,120
You spin me right round.

2150
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:29,560
Right round.

2151
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,180
The noise cancellation.

2152
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,820
Do you want to cheat?

2153
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:35,520
Do you want to cheat?

2154
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:36,160
Do you want to steal?

2155
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:36,920
How do I cheat?

2156
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:41,700
Okay, grab this to the ship and then Sam E when the ship leaves.

2157
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:42,100
Okay.

2158
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,380
I hit you so hard I hit myself.

2159
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:49,020
Let's turn this trusty frying pan...

2160
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:53,160
into a drying pan!

2161
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:58,720
Did you girls see us continuously make grandpa fall down the stairs?

2162
01:36:58,720 --> 01:36:59,120
Yes!

2163
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,260
It was so good!

2164
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:05,720
I didn't even know he would go down those ones.

2165
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:07,620
I just heard like, who's happy?

2166
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:11,440
Do you think they'll patch this cheat out?

2167
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:12,840
Oh yeah, for sure.

2168
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:13,340
Oh.

2169
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:15,460
We stealing.

2170
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:16,480
We stealing.

2171
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:18,260
Alright, we good.

2172
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:19,200
So, E?

2173
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,480
E, E, E, E, yep.

2174
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,080
Limes, are you also stealing health?

2175
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,200
I can E if you want.

2176
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,080
I wasn't going to because I'm fairly healthy.

2177
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:26,800
Okay.

2178
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:28,680
Get it.

2179
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,380
I'm spamming, I'm spamming.

2180
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:34,360
Spamming, spamming, spamming, spamming, spamming, spamming, spamming.

2181
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,440
When do I stop?

2182
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:41,500
Keep going, keep going.

2183
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:41,720
Okay.

2184
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:43,860
You should be good.

2185
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,760
Stinder, Mint, you guys have a health and a stamina.

2186
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:50,860
Pick one, which one do you want?

2187
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,200
How much stamina do you have?

2188
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:57,420
Fifty.

2189
01:37:58,240 --> 01:37:59,220
Can it take forever?

2190
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,260
I love it.

2191
01:38:00,260 --> 01:38:00,940
So do I.

2192
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:02,960
How much health do you have?

2193
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:04,080
Like your max health.

2194
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,000
One forty.

2195
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:07,280
I've got one.

2196
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:08,180
Holy moly.

2197
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:08,540
Okay.

2198
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:09,420
I have a hundred.

2199
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:10,920
You guys are so healthy.

2200
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:12,300
Wait, wait, Mint, Mint, Mint, hold on.

2201
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:12,560
Okay.

2202
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:13,280
Too late.

2203
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:14,260
It's okay, it's okay, don't worry about it.

2204
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:15,600
No, no, it's fine.

2205
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:16,620
I'll do a health upgrade next time.

2206
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:18,120
I've just been so strong.

2207
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:19,260
My bad.

2208
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,180
No, no, don't worry about it.

2209
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:22,860
I'm a speedy, I'm a speed demon.

2210
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:24,900
Yeah.

2211
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,100
So when's the gun show start?

2212
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:28,580
We haven't got it.

2213
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:32,400
So, unfortunately with this game, you kind of have to like also get like the guns and items.

2214
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,460
For you girl, anytime.

2215
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:35,500
No, I meant, I meant...

2216
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:36,040
You have to get what?

2217
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:37,300
All her sexy guns.

2218
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:37,820
Oh, what was that?

2219
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:40,340
That's the extraction.

2220
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,780
Anytime, anytime you want it, I'm here.

2221
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,440
Man, I'm pretty.

2222
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:50,620
Look, Mint, it's your trophy.

2223
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:52,380
It says number one loser.

2224
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:55,600
Haha.

2225
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:57,440
You're dumb, you're dumb.

2226
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:01,680
I think, I think it's yours because you read it first.

2227
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:03,540
Who smelled it dealt it.

2228
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:05,940
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, loser, loser, loser.

2229
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:07,800
L, L, L, L, stinky.

2230
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:08,800
L, L, L.

2231
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:09,520
Stupid cockroach.

2232
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:10,980
L, L, L, cockroach, cockroach.

2233
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:13,580
Everybody is like, oh my god, she's going to heaven.

2234
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,480
I'm like, have you guys met your Oshi?

2235
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,180
She is, the fact that she is here proves we are in purgatory.

2236
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,320
I think that's true.

2237
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:21,860
Yeah, I don't think they...

2238
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:22,480
Oh, hello.

2239
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:24,620
There's also something right there.

2240
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:26,840
Pardon.

2241
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:29,080
What are these?

2242
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:30,380
Oh, there's also grandma's ashes.

2243
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:31,920
What is this?

2244
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:34,680
A doll.

2245
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,620
Oh, it is a doll.

2246
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:37,960
Oh, it's cute.

2247
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:38,900
Creepy doll.

2248
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:40,680
Oh, yeah, creepy doll.

2249
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:46,260
Hello.

2250
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:52,430
A vase.

2251
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:53,210
A vase.

2252
01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:55,490
Yeah, grandma's ashes and big cube.

2253
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:57,090
Oh, there's stuff here too.

2254
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,050
Actually, you might...

2255
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:03,090
Oh my god, is there a strong sexy 4'11 woman?

2256
01:40:05,230 --> 01:40:05,810
Me?

2257
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:09,010
Strong sexy 4'11 woman.

2258
01:40:09,110 --> 01:40:11,050
Stop, why are you so obsessed with me?

2259
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:13,770
You're not sexy or strong.

2260
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17,230
I'll carry this right back to spawn.

2261
01:40:17,470 --> 01:40:18,270
I got a diamond.

2262
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:19,410
Oh!

2263
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:20,930
Me!

2264
01:40:24,510 --> 01:40:26,250
She was targeted!

2265
01:40:26,570 --> 01:40:27,410
I saw that!

2266
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:27,890
You saw!

2267
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:30,710
You're my witness in court, Cinder!

2268
01:40:30,830 --> 01:40:32,050
You're my witness in court!

2269
01:40:36,110 --> 01:40:39,030
Oh my god, so you're saying I'm smart and I have a big head?

2270
01:40:39,210 --> 01:40:40,690
Uh-oh, there's something in here.

2271
01:40:42,130 --> 01:40:43,990
I can carry the card, by the way.

2272
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:45,810
It's purple.

2273
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:53,350
Careful.

2274
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:54,630
Careful.

2275
01:41:01,110 --> 01:41:05,070
It makes me sound like I'm actually having an asthma attack when I say your name.

2276
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:12,250
Something just took her away, finally.

2277
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:16,450
Yeah, I don't know what just happened.

2278
01:41:18,150 --> 01:41:19,870
Something like dragged her into the darkness.

2279
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:27,640
She's probably fine.

2280
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:30,640
There was one more room back here that I wanted to pick up.

2281
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,100
And then we can bring stuff back.

2282
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:42,420
I like the locations.

2283
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,180
Oh my god.

2284
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:48,640
Lagooner's here.

2285
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:49,740
Lagooner's here.

2286
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:52,740
There's an invisible Gooner.

2287
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:57,960
He runs along invisible going plop, plop, plop and then he grabs you and takes you to a different part of the map.

2288
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,300
That's what he did to Matara!

2289
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:00,220
She got gooned!

2290
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:04,860
Lagooner got her.

2291
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,880
I like the crackhead wizard here.

2292
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,320
I know, I like this guy.

2293
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:15,880
You think that's a dev or...?

2294
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:18,000
I think so.

2295
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:19,660
Sorry for calling you a crackhead, devs.

2296
01:42:22,740 --> 01:42:24,740
So is she alive or...?

2297
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:28,020
She'll have been like dragged off to some other part of the castle.

2298
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:31,300
Lagooner didn't kill me the last time he kidnapped me, so maybe she's fine.

2299
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:33,260
She's fine.

2300
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:34,440
Yeah, just like I said.

2301
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:35,820
Yeah, exactly.

2302
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:38,420
How would you do to avoid him?

2303
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:42,360
I guess run away yelling Gooner because it worked for me.

2304
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:45,260
You just shame him dude.

2305
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:45,860
Easy.

2306
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:48,380
Bro's like, that ain't me.

2307
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:48,780
I...

2308
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:53,260
I ain't no tier 3 sub.

2309
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,640
What's that sound?

2310
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,380
I thought that thud was the...

2311
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:06,140
Cast some spell!

2312
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,620
Make me taller!

2313
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:10,440
Make me taller!

2314
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,160
Ok, so I can't make you taller, but I can make you much, much shorter.

2315
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,380
I'm gonna take this back to the thing.

2316
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:26,200
Why don't we use this again?

2317
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:29,580
Oh, something just...

2318
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:31,120
Something's around here.

2319
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,780
It's a new one in the box!

2320
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:36,320
This is a collector's item!

2321
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:39,040
This is fancy.

2322
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:40,660
Oh, this looks like a broomstick.

2323
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,020
It's the speed demon!

2324
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:47,020
We should...

2325
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:47,620
Yeah, let's take it.

2326
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:48,460
Ten thousand!

2327
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:49,420
Oh, it's heavy.

2328
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:53,580
Oh, we should find the next point to bring it to actually.

2329
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:53,920
Yeah.

2330
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:57,620
Or, or we could take it to the one we just found.

2331
01:43:57,740 --> 01:43:58,480
Yeah, I think so too.

2332
01:43:58,580 --> 01:43:59,340
I think we could take it there.

2333
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:00,380
And then we could save it earlier.

2334
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:00,680
It's close.

2335
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:01,000
Yeah.

2336
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:02,660
Ten thousand.

2337
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:05,520
Oh, you got it?

2338
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:06,260
Ok, we got it?

2339
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:06,600
We're good.

2340
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:08,280
Yeah, we're good, we're good.

2341
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:09,280
We got this.

2342
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,160
Nice and easy.

2343
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:14,400
Yeah, yeah.

2344
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:16,260
It's this way and then to the right.

2345
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:18,320
Oh yeah, that's right.

2346
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:20,840
I am so bad with directions.

2347
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:22,940
I got you.

2348
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:24,440
I got you.

2349
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:25,800
Oh, there we go.

2350
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:26,640
You were right.

2351
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:26,980
Yeah.

2352
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,080
Oh, this way.

2353
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:30,460
Whichever.

2354
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:33,560
It's like there's two sides.

2355
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:35,800
We're both going up different ways.

2356
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:37,920
I'm lifted.

2357
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:38,860
I'm lifted.

2358
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:39,140
Up the stairs.

2359
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:39,660
Up the stairs.

2360
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:40,400
Ok.

2361
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:41,780
We're so close.

2362
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:42,900
And...

2363
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:43,500
On the ground?

2364
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,040
Yeah, we could just put it...

2365
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,020
Oh, oh, me on the ground.

2366
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:46,500
Just kidding.

2367
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:55,540
That was so good.

2368
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,480
I thought we might have at least bonked it a little bit on the way up here.

2369
01:44:58,500 --> 01:44:58,500
No.

2370
01:44:58,520 --> 01:44:59,020
Oh, hello.

2371
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:01,860
We found a really giant room.

2372
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:04,160
Oh, that's cool.

2373
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:05,300
It's $10,000.

2374
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:07,920
That's a lot of dollars.

2375
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:08,900
Did we want to leave?

2376
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:10,240
Oh, that's a plant.

2377
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:15,280
We need to find Matara and pop like her head with all the loot that we got.

2378
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:17,080
Because we have like loads back at the base.

2379
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:17,880
You think she's dead?

2380
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:19,960
Ok, guys.

2381
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,300
No, she's right here.

2382
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:23,440
I got snatched!

2383
01:45:23,820 --> 01:45:28,600
And then he brought me in a room with this theater guy and there's the big, the big one-eyed guy that like...

2384
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:30,060
But there's so much treasure.

2385
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:31,540
I'm just gonna call it the first extraction point.

2386
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:33,660
There's a one-eyed what?

2387
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:34,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2388
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:35,200
Lime, lime, lime, lime, lime.

2389
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:35,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2390
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:36,280
Lime!

2391
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,500
The way she zoomed into frame was so funny.

2392
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:49,040
No one...

2393
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:50,240
saw that.

2394
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:51,980
Ok, never mind.

2395
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:53,660
No one saw that.

2396
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:54,640
No one saw that.

2397
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:55,320
No one saw that.

2398
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:55,900
No one saw that.

2399
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:57,160
No one saw that.

2400
01:45:58,260 --> 01:45:58,660
Yeah.

2401
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:04,940
You literally just got dragged away.

2402
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:05,980
It was so funny.

2403
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:14,260
Really?

2404
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:18,220
Like a new experience for you?

2405
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:20,080
Can I jump on top of this?

2406
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:26,000
I don't think that's... Oops.

2407
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:27,260
I don't think that's true.

2408
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:30,940
Okay.

2409
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:36,480
So you want the gooner.

2410
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:40,860
Yeah, she wants the gooner.

2411
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:42,980
Oh, you do?

2412
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:44,500
Okay.

2413
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,720
There's another thing up there too.

2414
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:50,360
What was that sound?

2415
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:55,810
Oh!

2416
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:57,920
Selling stuff.

2417
01:46:58,140 --> 01:46:58,300
Yeah!

2418
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:01,160
Selling stuff.

2419
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:02,480
Oh, they are selling stuff.

2420
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:08,470
What's happening?

2421
01:47:09,190 --> 01:47:13,190
Oh, this is the thing that slows you down.

2422
01:47:14,210 --> 01:47:17,250
I'm going really slowly.

2423
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:21,170
Blah, blah, blah.

2424
01:47:23,050 --> 01:47:25,350
Mataracon stinks!

2425
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:28,790
What just happened?

2426
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:36,930
I'm coming!

2427
01:47:38,770 --> 01:47:41,650
There we go.

2428
01:47:41,710 --> 01:47:43,850
Nice and easy.

2429
01:47:44,830 --> 01:47:45,270
Yep.

2430
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:46,290
Okay.

2431
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:47,230
What did I say?

2432
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:54,150
I'm good!

2433
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:58,130
Something is chasing after me too.

2434
01:48:00,630 --> 01:48:02,110
There's like a million things in here.

2435
01:48:02,330 --> 01:48:03,090
What is going on?

2436
01:48:03,490 --> 01:48:05,510
There's like a million things...

2437
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,380
I can use this to attack too maybe.

2438
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:51,840
What is that?

2439
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:52,980
Oops.

2440
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:54,720
That's fine.

2441
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:56,380
It's still worth money.

2442
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:02,380
Again?

2443
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:17,540
Again?

2444
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:18,560
Hello!

2445
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:19,660
I'm back!

2446
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:20,520
Hi!

2447
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:22,000
Bye-bye!

2448
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:25,600
I'm alive!

2449
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:26,900
I'm getting goons again!

2450
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:27,940
Help me!

2451
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:31,600
Thank you!

2452
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:34,640
Oh, gross!

2453
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,160
Wait, what is that thing?

2454
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:40,420
Is that not it?

2455
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:41,440
Oh, it's gone.

2456
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:47,560
Actually, now I have... I knew where I was before and now I have no idea!

2457
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:51,220
Is this where the ship is?

2458
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,620
I knew where I was before!

2459
01:50:58,320 --> 01:50:59,720
Now I have no idea.

2460
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:01,840
It's time for the map.

2461
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:03,980
Oh, is that what the ship looks like?

2462
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:07,480
I think this is the ship, no?

2463
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:10,120
Yeah!

2464
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:23,980
Just a little sip for the road.

2465
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:28,160
Wait, sorry, I just turned around.

2466
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:35,640
He just drags you wherever he pleases.

2467
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:37,900
He kind of saved me from that guy.

2468
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:38,700
I'm not going to lie.

2469
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:44,800
OK Hello!

2470
01:51:49,650 --> 01:51:50,170
Hello!

2471
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:51,230
Hello!

2472
01:51:51,570 --> 01:51:51,750
Hello!

2473
01:51:52,370 --> 01:51:53,730
A weird tour guide.

2474
01:51:55,670 --> 01:51:56,190
Hello!

2475
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:05,100
I thought you were saying hi to me.

2476
01:52:17,410 --> 01:52:18,790
He can't hear me, right?

2477
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:21,430
Babe!

2478
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:24,270
Hey, stupid!

2479
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:25,150
Stupid!

2480
01:52:27,530 --> 01:52:28,910
He's an ogre.

2481
01:52:30,970 --> 01:52:36,010
Yeah, that guy is really, really strong and he will definitely do some serious damage.

2482
01:52:36,030 --> 01:52:38,590
Hey, can a couple of people come and help me lift the box up the stairs?

2483
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:39,970
I cannot do that one by myself.

2484
01:52:41,770 --> 01:52:43,490
At least he's slow, right?

2485
01:52:45,910 --> 01:52:50,890
OK We cannot let this one tip over, otherwise it starts taking tons of damage.

2486
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:51,730
So we gotta be careful.

2487
01:52:52,350 --> 01:52:53,730
I wouldn't know that.

2488
01:52:56,830 --> 01:52:57,610
Oh, sorry.

2489
01:52:58,770 --> 01:52:59,610
I'm coming back!

2490
01:53:00,630 --> 01:53:02,390
Oh, you got it, you got it, you got it.

2491
01:53:02,670 --> 01:53:04,990
OK Oh no, the money bag!

2492
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:08,130
We're fine, we're fine.

2493
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:10,490
I think we pop this extraction point now.

2494
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:12,110
Because, like, that's a lot.

2495
01:53:12,110 --> 01:53:14,150
OK Box first, maybe, and then broom.

2496
01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:15,510
Box, then broom, then bag.

2497
01:53:15,630 --> 01:53:17,090
OK I'll move this out of the way.

2498
01:53:18,150 --> 01:53:19,010
Oh, thank you.

2499
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:25,700
Shall we... Oh, so box first, then broom, then bag.

2500
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:26,000
OK.

2501
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:28,240
You got it, you got it.

2502
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:30,380
You got it.

2503
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:31,560
Easy.

2504
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:33,140
Hell yeah.

2505
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:34,180
Bag.

2506
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:39,280
Alright.

2507
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:41,860
Oh, watch out!

2508
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:42,880
Get out of there!

2509
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:46,340
Oh, I was worried about it.

2510
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:46,900
That sucks.

2511
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:48,180
Wait, what happened?

2512
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:51,000
The box broke, but we still got the broom.

2513
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,480
Yeah, the box broke.

2514
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,580
I was trying to pull out the broom brick.

2515
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:55,820
Oh, that sucks.

2516
01:53:56,060 --> 01:53:57,820
Wait, we still got the money for it?

2517
01:53:57,860 --> 01:53:58,780
Wait, we have...

2518
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:00,940
We got... We got some of it.

2519
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:04,000
Eww!

2520
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:06,740
Give me a hug!

2521
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:07,360
Eww!

2522
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:09,160
No, no, don't get near her!

2523
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:10,400
Give me a hug!

2524
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:11,460
Give me a hug!

2525
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:13,520
Eww!

2526
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:19,840
Eww!

2527
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:21,280
Get away from me, you freak!

2528
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:27,280
Stop throwing up on me, please!

2529
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,440
It's not funny.

2530
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:33,720
I don't love you out there.

2531
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,220
Wait, what is that thing?

2532
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:37,360
Is that not the gooner?

2533
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:37,940
Avoid him.

2534
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:39,020
It is.

2535
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:40,060
Avoid him, avoid him, avoid him.

2536
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:40,660
That's not the gooner.

2537
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:42,420
The gooner is...

2538
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:44,140
Grab something small, we can smack him.

2539
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:45,880
Oh, uh...

2540
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:48,120
We've sold everything.

2541
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:49,520
No, no, no.

2542
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:51,020
I smacked him with the door before.

2543
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:51,880
Oh, okay.

2544
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:52,560
He's behind you!

2545
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,000
He's behind you!

2546
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:53,500
He's behind you!

2547
01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:58,400
Okay, you're good.

2548
01:54:58,480 --> 01:54:58,800
You're good.

2549
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:02,500
I could've slobbered all over you.

2550
01:55:05,020 --> 01:55:06,560
It just makes your tummy hurt.

2551
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:09,600
An apology for fucking that up.

2552
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:11,040
I'm bringing the rest of the stuff.

2553
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:15,900
Ah...

2554
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:17,380
Oh, I see.

2555
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:18,580
It didn't go through all the way.

2556
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:19,220
That sucks.

2557
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:23,940
No, the box got smooshed because the broom was out.

2558
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:25,460
And I was worried that the broom wouldn't count.

2559
01:55:25,580 --> 01:55:27,740
And then trying to move the broom in, the box went out.

2560
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,780
It's okay.

2561
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,400
Oh, Matara's Parasite is free.

2562
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:37,760
What are we careful about?

2563
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:41,420
Matara's Parasite is flying around in there now.

2564
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:42,180
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

2565
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:44,120
If I smack him with the door...

2566
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:48,240
If I smack him with the door, we can grab him and then kill him.

2567
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:48,880
Hold on, I'm...

2568
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:49,660
That's a weird looking door.

2569
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,820
When the Parasite gives you silly girl syndrome.

2570
01:55:52,580 --> 01:55:53,480
Make your tummy hurt.

2571
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:54,600
I wanna be a silly girl.

2572
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:57,720
Get him!

2573
01:55:59,340 --> 01:55:59,740
No!

2574
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:03,400
No!

2575
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:04,000
No!

2576
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:07,880
Oh, you can already grab him.

2577
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,200
It's because you're so strong.

2578
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:13,320
Yeah, you got him.

2579
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,420
Woah, what's the eyeball do?

2580
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:18,420
It's loot.

2581
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:21,620
Question though, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2582
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:23,640
Why did we keep this one for last?

2583
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,240
Because it's close to the base.

2584
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:26,720
No, it's already popped.

2585
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:31,060
Have we found the third one?

2586
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:36,920
I'm following.

2587
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:37,840
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

2588
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:39,240
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

2589
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:45,840
You know.

2590
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:47,460
What?

2591
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,120
You wouldn't know.

2592
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:50,360
You're not a maid.

2593
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,300
It's very special.

2594
01:56:52,540 --> 01:56:53,640
I have to preserve it.

2595
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:57,080
I have to preserve it for really intense cases.

2596
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:58,100
For real troubles.

2597
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:00,720
She can't hear me.

2598
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:05,080
I have to save it for you guys.

2599
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:08,540
Hehehe.

2600
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:12,740
Not gonna waste it on her.

2601
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:16,360
Find the next extraction point.

2602
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:17,600
Maybe I went past it.

2603
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:19,220
There's like, oh.

2604
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:20,420
Wait, who is that?

2605
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:20,740
Oh.

2606
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:20,940
Me.

2607
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:25,320
It's cuffing season.

2608
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:26,540
What?

2609
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:28,220
Mind careful, there's a big boy here.

2610
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:29,820
Oh, the walking man?

2611
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:31,680
Yeah, the slow walking man.

2612
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:32,120
Yeah.

2613
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:35,380
He's scary.

2614
01:57:36,980 --> 01:57:38,160
Does he get fast?

2615
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:39,400
When he sees you?

2616
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:40,100
No.

2617
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:41,440
But he can pull you aside.

2618
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:42,420
Oh, okay.

2619
01:57:42,820 --> 01:57:42,920
Oh!

2620
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:44,300
Oh!

2621
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:51,500
What?

2622
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:52,460
Matara?

2623
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:02,300
We need to pop the button when we see it.

2624
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:03,180
Yeah, I was...

2625
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:04,800
I got dragged into here earlier.

2626
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:06,660
Yeah, me too, me too.

2627
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:08,020
There's grandma's ashes.

2628
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:13,160
Oh, is that what that is?

2629
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:14,400
Oh, yeah.

2630
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:17,020
So now if you have items here, you can just put them there.

2631
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:17,680
Oh, okay.

2632
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:19,400
You can already put this item into...

2633
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:21,880
Oh, we can get grandma's ashes.

2634
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:24,240
Just try to put them all in like one side.

2635
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:25,080
Careful.

2636
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:26,980
Careful, behind you, behind you, behind you.

2637
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:27,540
Oh, oh, oh.

2638
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:31,120
Try to put them all in like one side, so that way we can put the garden to the other side.

2639
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:32,040
Okay, okay, okay.

2640
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:35,160
Strategic strategy.

2641
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:37,960
And always try to open doors through their forest.

2642
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:38,660
Okay.

2643
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:42,880
Careful.

2644
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:44,900
You wanna help me?

2645
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:47,640
I need your help with grandma!

2646
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,120
We're both going down.

2647
01:58:53,540 --> 01:58:54,420
No, there can only be one.

2648
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:54,780
No!

2649
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:56,500
My grandma is better.

2650
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:58,240
Wait, I just saw you lose a bunch of money.

2651
01:58:58,280 --> 01:58:58,720
What did you do?

2652
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:00,400
Oh, shit.

2653
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:02,740
Did you dump her all over the ground?

2654
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:03,920
Maybe.

2655
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:05,020
Yeah.

2656
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:07,560
So don't dump...

2657
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:07,780
Oh!

2658
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:09,300
I just saw you...

2659
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:11,500
My grandma is still worth more.

2660
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:12,240
Your grandma is pretty cool.

2661
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:13,280
She's worth more.

2662
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:13,760
Okay, well...

2663
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:15,200
Okay, well...

2664
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,240
That's a little...

2665
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:17,600
Racist, I guess?

2666
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:17,980
How?

2667
01:59:18,180 --> 01:59:19,000
Excuse me?

2668
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:27,840
How dare you say your elderly female relative is worth a lot?

2669
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:30,380
She is worth a lot, you know?

2670
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:31,540
Is there something here too?

2671
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:32,120
Wanna grab this?

2672
01:59:32,180 --> 01:59:33,820
I'll bring the cube and the other stuff.

2673
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:35,700
Yeah, I'm grabbing this thingy.

2674
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:36,660
I saw it earlier.

2675
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:39,020
Sometimes it like flags things randomly.

2676
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:40,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2677
01:59:41,820 --> 01:59:43,240
Yeah, we really lost a lot.

2678
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:46,260
Yeah, unfortunately we lost a lot.

2679
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:49,200
So sometimes, when you lose too much money...

2680
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:51,540
You basically then have to start killing the monsters.

2681
01:59:51,740 --> 01:59:52,940
Otherwise, you just won't make it.

2682
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:54,740
There's also something up here if you wanna grab it.

2683
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:56,320
I thought I saw something light up here.

2684
01:59:57,300 --> 01:59:58,040
Yeah, up there.

2685
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:02,100
If you ever look at your tab, it's gonna tell you roughly where it is.

2686
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:04,040
You can always find it again.

2687
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,240
Oh, I see.

2688
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:09,820
How do I get the thing up there?

2689
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:12,100
You jump up a little bit.

2690
02:00:12,980 --> 02:00:13,980
Is it that thing right there?

2691
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:15,720
Wait, which one?

2692
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:17,200
It's like a little clock up there.

2693
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:19,180
Oh, oh, oops.

2694
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:19,700
Do you see it?

2695
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:20,160
This thing?

2696
02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:21,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2697
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:22,920
You get better at recognizing things.

2698
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:26,400
I know right now it's kind of like, wow, how do I know that?

2699
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:28,280
But don't you just like check everything?

2700
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:29,160
You said it's a clock.

2701
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:29,960
It's an ocarina.

2702
02:00:31,540 --> 02:00:32,100
Oh, is it?

2703
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:32,820
It looked like a clock.

2704
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:37,000
Yellow dots.

2705
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:38,160
It looked like a clock.

2706
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:39,020
Oh, someone's coming.

2707
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:41,320
Who's that someone?

2708
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:41,940
I don't know.

2709
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:43,300
Is it the girls or is it a bad someone?

2710
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:44,060
They're blue.

2711
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:46,180
They're blue.

2712
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:48,420
Oh, blue is our cart.

2713
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:49,200
Oh.

2714
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:52,440
Yellow is the other players.

2715
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:53,260
Blue is a cart.

2716
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:55,080
And then sometimes you'll see red.

2717
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:56,180
Oh, there they are.

2718
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:57,600
Hello.

2719
02:00:58,700 --> 02:00:58,860
Hi.

2720
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:00,780
I think yellow is loot.

2721
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:02,260
Yeah, yellow is loot.

2722
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:05,280
And red is like their face.

2723
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:07,700
So you can see if somebody's alive if they move their face.

2724
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:08,860
So you can be like, oh, they're alive.

2725
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:10,280
All right, can one of you grab this?

2726
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:11,800
I cannot jump onto this bed.

2727
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:12,500
Hold on.

2728
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:14,420
This picture is awesome.

2729
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:16,680
You good?

2730
02:01:17,660 --> 02:01:18,900
Oh, you guys scared me.

2731
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:21,000
I see it.

2732
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:22,900
There's a trap door here.

2733
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:23,680
Oh my gosh.

2734
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:27,040
Is there anything in here?

2735
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:28,460
Now I know that...

2736
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:33,080
Okay, you do the bed.

2737
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:35,100
Where's the bed?

2738
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:35,860
What am I doing?

2739
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:39,040
Can you climb up there?

2740
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:42,300
I gotta get used to it.

2741
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:43,620
You're back!

2742
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:45,040
I was so scared for you.

2743
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:48,100
He brought me back right to where I was.

2744
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:50,880
Oh, I see, I see.

2745
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:52,580
Oh, oh, oh!

2746
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:53,460
I almost had it.

2747
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:53,660
Wait.

2748
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:56,600
Everybody's alive!

2749
02:01:58,440 --> 02:01:59,960
All right, there's a hourglass.

2750
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:00,240
Hold on.

2751
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:01,240
If you want to grab it.

2752
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:01,860
Hold on.

2753
02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:05,340
I'll give it to you to grab.

2754
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:05,900
Oh, never mind.

2755
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:06,840
You can try doing it.

2756
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:07,580
Right there.

2757
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:08,020
I can grab it?

2758
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:08,280
Yeah.

2759
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:09,100
Yeah.

2760
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:09,380
Yeah.

2761
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:09,660
Wait.

2762
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:11,420
I got it.

2763
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:12,560
Move back a little bit.

2764
02:02:12,620 --> 02:02:12,900
Yeah, yeah.

2765
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:14,480
I got it.

2766
02:02:17,020 --> 02:02:17,420
Wait.

2767
02:02:17,700 --> 02:02:18,400
She got it.

2768
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:20,280
I'm trying to slowly...

2769
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:21,820
All right, there we go.

2770
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,080
If you jump off, will you fall in slow motion too?

2771
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:26,240
Oh, let's try it.

2772
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:27,080
Let's try it.

2773
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:29,940
But make sure you keep the hourglass up.

2774
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:30,900
Keep it up.

2775
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:31,360
Keep it up.

2776
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:32,020
Higher than you.

2777
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:32,340
Okay.

2778
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:33,940
Oh, don't hit the ceiling!

2779
02:02:34,820 --> 02:02:36,000
Here I go!

2780
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:36,500
All right.

2781
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:38,360
Yay!

2782
02:02:41,740 --> 02:02:42,140
Amazing.

2783
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:43,240
Where are you guys?

2784
02:02:43,540 --> 02:02:44,660
She descended like a spirit.

2785
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:45,920
Behind you, behind you, behind you.

2786
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:46,140
Okay, I'm turning.

2787
02:02:46,140 --> 02:02:47,220
Wait, wait, bring the cart to her.

2788
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:48,260
Oh, yeah, she's...

2789
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:49,460
I'm turning slowly.

2790
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:51,980
The mint on the hourglass sounds really stoned.

2791
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:55,300
I mean, look at her eyes.

2792
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:56,320
I'm...

2793
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:56,940
I...

2794
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:58,280
I eat cookies.

2795
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:03,580
Wait, where's the cart?

2796
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:05,280
She got into the silly brownies.

2797
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:06,800
Where's the cart?

2798
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:07,740
You're doing amazing, sweetie.

2799
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,160
Where's the cart?

2800
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:09,720
Just keep going straight.

2801
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:10,280
Oh, okay.

2802
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:11,120
Keep going straight.

2803
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,560
Keep going straight, girl.

2804
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:13,200
You got it.

2805
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:13,700
Okay.

2806
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:15,720
I'm going.

2807
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:19,220
Mint, who's your favorite viewer?

2808
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:20,220
Try it.

2809
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:21,160
Viewer?

2810
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,220
I don't have one.

2811
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:28,860
I love everyone equally.

2812
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:32,580
I think she's trying to get you to say Mataracon.

2813
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,600
No, I don't watch her.

2814
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:35,480
I don't watch her.

2815
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:36,960
Hello, Mito.

2816
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:38,520
Live.

2817
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:47,120
You sound like Freddy Fazbear when you laugh.

2818
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:52,860
Hey, everybody, and welcome to the YouTube channel.

2819
02:03:53,620 --> 02:03:56,660
Mataracon Double D's Soul Threat.

2820
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:58,680
What?

2821
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:03,100
You've never heard of Dave Albor, you bitch?

2822
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:04,520
I think we have.

2823
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:05,400
What?

2824
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:08,100
Oh no, the QBA app.

2825
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:09,440
I think the Q is fine.

2826
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:10,260
There we go.

2827
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:10,960
It's good, it's good, it's good.

2828
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:13,440
Matara!

2829
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:18,220
You're alive!

2830
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:19,100
Welcome back.

2831
02:04:19,140 --> 02:04:20,020
How did you live?

2832
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:21,320
Oh, run?

2833
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:23,180
Yeah, we're going.

2834
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:25,360
Save your energy until you see someone.

2835
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:26,100
Because then...

2836
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:27,000
Look out for the big daddy.

2837
02:04:27,060 --> 02:04:28,420
I mean like run in spirit.

2838
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:29,240
Don't actually run.

2839
02:04:29,260 --> 02:04:29,580
Oh yeah, yeah.

2840
02:04:30,820 --> 02:04:31,680
Running in spirit.

2841
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:32,260
Running in spirit.

2842
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:32,600
Go in her!

2843
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:33,180
Go in her!

2844
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:34,540
Go in her!

2845
02:04:36,460 --> 02:04:38,260
I'm getting dragged towards the entrance.

2846
02:04:38,420 --> 02:04:39,220
Let's go!

2847
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:43,680
I'm getting dragged towards the entrance.

2848
02:04:43,820 --> 02:04:44,300
Let's go!

2849
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:46,560
Thanks Gooner.

2850
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:48,220
Oh my gosh, wait.

2851
02:04:48,260 --> 02:04:49,520
I'm actually getting dragged towards the entrance.

2852
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:51,080
I'm cheating.

2853
02:04:54,180 --> 02:04:55,020
Thank you.

2854
02:05:22,350 --> 02:05:25,550
I heard him huffing and puffing, but I didn't let him get me.

2855
02:05:26,410 --> 02:05:27,710
Now leave them.

2856
02:05:29,710 --> 02:05:33,210
They have 30 seconds before I start the countdown.

2857
02:05:35,450 --> 02:05:36,950
It was a wisp.

2858
02:05:38,110 --> 02:05:39,090
Thank you guys.

2859
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:46,560
What do I do?

2860
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:48,080
Gosh, I had the easy way, huh?

2861
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:50,540
They have to get past the big guy.

2862
02:05:52,340 --> 02:05:53,920
I had it so easy.

2863
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:57,020
My guy literally ran right past me.

2864
02:05:57,480 --> 02:05:59,060
Made me run right past him.

2865
02:05:59,100 --> 02:05:59,760
It was awesome.

2866
02:06:00,700 --> 02:06:02,680
I didn't have to do anything.

2867
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:04,600
Mito wins by doing nothing!

2868
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:06,880
I should hide still just in case.

2869
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:08,980
Imagine if he comes and grabs me again.

2870
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:10,580
That would suck so bad.

2871
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:12,540
Can you check the map?

2872
02:06:14,860 --> 02:06:15,900
Can I zoom out?

2873
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
I can't.

2874
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:20,500
What's the red thing?

2875
02:06:21,820 --> 02:06:22,960
Is that the extractor?

2876
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:23,960
Wait, what's the red thing?

2877
02:06:26,660 --> 02:06:27,480
What is that?

2878
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:32,500
Oh, it is an extraction.

2879
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:35,960
They're slow.

2880
02:06:36,100 --> 02:06:38,340
No, I ran past the giant guy.

2881
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,840
They have to be careful around him or they'll die.

2882
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:47,780
That's where you extract stuff.

2883
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:50,640
I don't remember that one.

2884
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:54,760
I only remember...

2885
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:57,160
The one up the stairs.

2886
02:06:57,160 --> 02:06:59,240
Actually, I guess this was the first one.

2887
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:01,700
Maybe they're dead?

2888
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:03,720
No, they're not dead.

2889
02:07:04,120 --> 02:07:05,020
They're alive.

2890
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:10,620
They're alive, I believe, I believe, I believe.

2891
02:07:11,820 --> 02:07:13,940
I can't see anything about them though.

2892
02:07:17,460 --> 02:07:19,320
I'm wiggling so I can...

2893
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:22,800
Wishful thinking?

2894
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:23,900
No, they're alive.

2895
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:24,800
They're alive for sure.

2896
02:07:27,160 --> 02:07:28,800
How long should I wait though?

2897
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:31,520
How long?

2898
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,940
Maybe they'll get got by the gooner and they'll also run all the way here.

2899
02:07:39,620 --> 02:07:42,420
He'll be a kind, gentle soul to them as well.

2900
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:47,220
Five more minutes, okay.

2901
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:51,080
I wonder if I should go to the bathroom.

2902
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:51,200
Bathroom.

2903
02:07:57,680 --> 02:08:00,300
Hurry up guys, hurry up.

2904
02:08:01,620 --> 02:08:03,020
Hurry up everybody.

2905
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:05,740
It's so hard being me, I'm bored.

2906
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:25,980
Nothing yet?

2907
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:33,950
I want to have faith that they'll make it.

2908
02:08:35,270 --> 02:08:39,310
Watch they're all dead right now talking in the chat.

2909
02:08:39,830 --> 02:08:41,650
Being like, Minto, please press the button.

2910
02:08:43,470 --> 02:08:44,810
Nah, they're alive.

2911
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:03,180
What's that sound?

2912
02:09:06,120 --> 02:09:07,580
I think I'm going to press the button.

2913
02:09:11,290 --> 02:09:12,890
What was that sound?

2914
02:09:18,090 --> 02:09:19,490
Oh, I'm here!

2915
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:35,630
I got gooned, but he dragged me all the way here.

2916
02:09:35,950 --> 02:09:37,550
That was nice of him.

2917
02:09:37,610 --> 02:09:38,910
I know, I think he's a fan.

2918
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:42,490
Wait, I didn't see you on the map, that's so weird.

2919
02:09:43,070 --> 02:09:47,010
You can't actually see your friends on the map, because otherwise it would spoil whether or not they're alive.

2920
02:09:48,730 --> 02:09:51,470
Yeah, the yellow dots there are like loot.

2921
02:09:52,210 --> 02:09:53,690
Are we just going to wait for Matara then?

2922
02:09:54,730 --> 02:10:00,510
She said go without me, I didn't hear if she said I'm not going to run back or if she said I'll run back.

2923
02:10:01,030 --> 02:10:05,290
That's like two very mixed messages, we could give her a couple of minutes and if she doesn't show up...

2924
02:10:05,290 --> 02:10:05,910
What about Cinder?

2925
02:10:07,350 --> 02:10:09,430
Cinder we lost like right at the start.

2926
02:10:09,430 --> 02:10:13,910
Apparently someone spoiled it for Matara what happened to her, so that person got timed out.

2927
02:10:14,130 --> 02:10:15,730
I don't know what happened to her.

2928
02:10:17,350 --> 02:10:19,430
Cinder, if you can hear us...

2929
02:10:20,110 --> 02:10:21,210
Hey girl, hey.

2930
02:10:23,290 --> 02:10:25,890
I miss my Nations of the World soulmate.

2931
02:10:26,330 --> 02:10:27,770
We sang together, it was beautiful.

2932
02:10:30,510 --> 02:10:31,530
Sounds lovely.

2933
02:10:32,630 --> 02:10:33,750
It was.

2934
02:10:35,070 --> 02:10:35,470
Alright.

2935
02:10:36,110 --> 02:10:39,490
I mean the thing is if she gets stuck behind the big guy again, it's going to be forever.

2936
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:43,690
And if the gooner runs in, one of us is getting dragged out.

2937
02:10:45,450 --> 02:10:51,030
Let's do a pact, if the gooner comes in and drags one of us out, the other person just takes off in the ship.

2938
02:10:51,170 --> 02:10:52,030
Because that's bullshit.

2939
02:10:52,690 --> 02:10:52,890
Yeah.

2940
02:10:53,910 --> 02:10:54,250
Okay.

2941
02:11:02,860 --> 02:11:04,280
I sure hope he doesn't get me.

2942
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:07,080
Have you got gooned yet?

2943
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:11,080
No, I keep sliding under furniture every time he tries.

2944
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:13,220
Then it's your turn, honestly.

2945
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:16,120
I don't wanna.

2946
02:11:17,860 --> 02:11:20,280
I think, you know, Matara is...

2947
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:21,860
She's a bit slow.

2948
02:11:22,220 --> 02:11:23,460
I think we could just go, no?

2949
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:29,920
We can go as long as you tell her it was your fault.

2950
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:31,560
Oh yeah, I'm totally fine with that.

2951
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:34,520
No, she was alive!

2952
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:35,360
She was alive!

2953
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:38,080
Oh god, Matara!

2954
02:11:38,620 --> 02:11:39,220
Matara!

2955
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:44,240
Bye Matara!

2956
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:47,320
She'll make it, she'll make it.

2957
02:11:47,340 --> 02:11:48,220
I didn't want for this.

2958
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:49,660
She'll totally have that.

2959
02:11:49,700 --> 02:11:50,340
Wait, I think I just heard her.

2960
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:52,460
Did I just hear her yell?

2961
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:54,540
No.

2962
02:11:57,860 --> 02:11:59,440
She's got 10 seconds.

2963
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:00,740
10...

2964
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:02,120
Oh, 9...

2965
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:04,440
8...

2966
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:05,980
She's so needy.

2967
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:07,120
She's sending us all these texts.

2968
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,760
Remember like the AOL notification sound?

2969
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:14,800
Just that over and over again.

2970
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:16,840
OK, we're breaking it up.

2971
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:19,560
Bye Matara!

2972
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:21,360
Bye Matara!

2973
02:12:24,020 --> 02:12:25,440
Jake, please don't.

2974
02:12:30,950 --> 02:12:33,410
Matara was like monologuing.

2975
02:12:37,150 --> 02:12:38,210
Like three times.

2976
02:12:39,690 --> 02:12:40,970
Wait, are you serious?

2977
02:12:41,070 --> 02:12:42,330
He kept dragging you back?

2978
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:46,490
While I was in the little hallway to the ship, he kept dragging me back.

2979
02:12:46,670 --> 02:12:50,630
At one point I was like, please mom, you can hear me telepathically, end it all.

2980
02:12:51,170 --> 02:12:52,210
And she was self-destructive.

2981
02:12:53,290 --> 02:12:54,250
She was self-destructive.

2982
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:56,070
I put you out of your misery.

2983
02:12:56,750 --> 02:13:01,310
I saw like a lower level and I was like, oh what's down here?

2984
02:13:01,410 --> 02:13:03,730
So I jumped down and it was a spike pit.

2985
02:13:04,530 --> 02:13:07,630
You honestly had a fucking horror movie death then.

2986
02:13:07,890 --> 02:13:10,610
You legitimately, like you were right behind us.

2987
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:12,430
We turned around and we were like, where's Dender?

2988
02:13:12,590 --> 02:13:15,150
You just vanished like it was a horror movie.

2989
02:13:16,010 --> 02:13:18,130
Should we get any weapons?

2990
02:13:18,230 --> 02:13:18,810
What do you think?

2991
02:13:19,210 --> 02:13:19,870
There's the sledgehammer.

2992
02:13:19,870 --> 02:13:20,610
I just don't know.

2993
02:13:20,910 --> 02:13:21,790
Sledgehammer would be good.

2994
02:13:21,790 --> 02:13:22,510
Oh, the sledgehammer!

2995
02:13:23,630 --> 02:13:27,510
Sledgehammer is more for breaking locks though rather than actual assault.

2996
02:13:27,670 --> 02:13:30,570
Yeah, I wanna get more money though.

2997
02:13:30,570 --> 02:13:34,890
I bought a health upgrade and a strength upgrade and I got a strength upgrade for someone else too.

2998
02:13:34,970 --> 02:13:36,070
I won't eat both, I promise.

2999
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:37,510
I definitely want one of them.

3000
02:13:38,090 --> 02:13:38,490
Please.

3001
02:13:38,790 --> 02:13:39,150
Okay.

3002
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:41,830
I'm stealing health, I'm sorry.

3003
02:13:43,030 --> 02:13:43,930
Me too.

3004
02:13:44,690 --> 02:13:47,890
It went from 120 health to 1 and I'm kinda salty about it.

3005
02:13:49,290 --> 02:13:51,350
We're playing this for people.

3006
02:13:51,630 --> 02:13:53,030
We're teaching how to play.

3007
02:13:54,530 --> 02:13:57,350
There are many shit boost items in here.

3008
02:14:02,030 --> 02:14:05,050
I think this would be great for attacking.

3009
02:14:14,150 --> 02:14:15,690
You don't have to bring it back, but yeah.

3010
02:14:15,710 --> 02:14:15,990
Who got me?

3011
02:14:17,650 --> 02:14:18,590
You got you.

3012
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:19,630
I got myself?

3013
02:14:19,790 --> 02:14:20,570
The Booner thing was BS.

3014
02:14:20,850 --> 02:14:23,350
I don't think it was BS, it's just that I didn't understand how it works.

3015
02:14:23,770 --> 02:14:27,650
I thought that if I just stayed quiet he wouldn't snatch me, but I was supposed to hide.

3016
02:14:27,650 --> 02:14:31,430
As soon as you see him, I just dart for cover and it seems to work quite well.

3017
02:14:31,450 --> 02:14:32,630
He dragged me to the entrance.

3018
02:14:32,750 --> 02:14:33,810
I don't know why he hates you.

3019
02:14:36,870 --> 02:14:40,710
I think he just drags you to the complete opposite end of where you are.

3020
02:14:41,850 --> 02:14:44,390
So in your case, he caught you early.

3021
02:14:44,890 --> 02:14:45,510
Alright, did it work?

3022
02:14:46,650 --> 02:14:48,110
We forgot to buy!

3023
02:14:52,530 --> 02:14:53,670
Nobody hit the button.

3024
02:14:59,110 --> 02:15:00,210
It's not my responsibility.

3025
02:15:02,110 --> 02:15:03,670
I thought we liked shopping.

3026
02:15:03,870 --> 02:15:05,130
I thought we were women who shop.

3027
02:15:05,270 --> 02:15:05,730
What happened?

3028
02:15:06,170 --> 02:15:08,910
I think I started scanning E a little too late.

3029
02:15:10,770 --> 02:15:12,330
We can just...

3030
02:15:12,330 --> 02:15:12,990
What a bust.

3031
02:15:13,510 --> 02:15:15,110
Let me hold you by the neck next time.

3032
02:15:15,230 --> 02:15:19,090
I wanna hold her neck.

3033
02:15:19,350 --> 02:15:20,030
Stop holding her neck.

3034
02:15:20,130 --> 02:15:21,870
Hold on, can we also hold Cinder's neck?

3035
02:15:22,070 --> 02:15:22,590
Wait, how do I do it?

3036
02:15:23,390 --> 02:15:24,350
I wanna hold her neck.

3037
02:15:25,910 --> 02:15:26,970
I've got 70!

3038
02:15:27,070 --> 02:15:27,510
I've got 90!

3039
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:29,190
Is that okay on health?

3040
02:15:29,470 --> 02:15:29,730
Yeah!

3041
02:15:30,530 --> 02:15:31,390
Yeah, I'm good.

3042
02:15:31,810 --> 02:15:34,170
I have 69 health now, so I'm okay with this.

3043
02:15:34,390 --> 02:15:35,630
I have 90 cynics!

3044
02:15:35,770 --> 02:15:37,450
Oh my gosh, we're opposites.

3045
02:15:38,950 --> 02:15:39,950
Hold on, y'all.

3046
02:15:40,090 --> 02:15:41,530
I gotta thank our Ray.

3047
02:15:42,790 --> 02:15:43,450
Hi, Ray!

3048
02:15:44,990 --> 02:15:45,390
Hello!

3049
02:15:47,010 --> 02:15:47,410
Hiya!

3050
02:15:50,650 --> 02:15:52,170
What the fuck is that?

3051
02:15:52,990 --> 02:15:54,170
Oh, there's a block.

3052
02:15:54,270 --> 02:15:54,970
I don't like that.

3053
02:15:55,290 --> 02:15:55,850
Do you see that?

3054
02:15:55,890 --> 02:15:56,810
I've not seen that before.

3055
02:15:56,810 --> 02:15:58,250
Is that a blob of meat?

3056
02:15:59,650 --> 02:15:59,890
Oh!

3057
02:16:01,110 --> 02:16:01,230
Hello!

3058
02:16:04,570 --> 02:16:05,610
Blob of meat?

3059
02:16:07,670 --> 02:16:08,610
It's breathing.

3060
02:16:08,810 --> 02:16:09,330
It's breathing.

3061
02:16:10,630 --> 02:16:11,650
I think it's like a cat.

3062
02:16:16,370 --> 02:16:19,750
What if I touch it?

3063
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:23,750
Matara, shut up!

3064
02:16:27,010 --> 02:16:27,410
Hello!

3065
02:16:30,930 --> 02:16:32,190
Have you messed with it yet?

3066
02:16:32,770 --> 02:16:34,430
I'm trying to touch it, but it's not touching.

3067
02:16:34,610 --> 02:16:36,250
I think it's just a giant pomegranate.

3068
02:16:37,990 --> 02:16:39,070
It's pulsating, though.

3069
02:16:39,130 --> 02:16:39,770
I don't like that.

3070
02:16:40,390 --> 02:16:42,170
Have you, like, actually touched it?

3071
02:16:43,090 --> 02:16:44,190
Yeah, I'm trying to touch it.

3072
02:16:44,570 --> 02:16:45,350
I'm on top of it.

3073
02:16:46,330 --> 02:16:47,190
Oh, that's weird.

3074
02:16:48,070 --> 02:16:48,550
The fuck?

3075
02:16:48,810 --> 02:16:51,630
I think we'll hate this thing later, probably.

3076
02:16:52,810 --> 02:16:53,190
Yeah.

3077
02:16:54,010 --> 02:16:57,990
I kinda wanted to, like, throw Matara into it, but I didn't manage to grab her before she got up.

3078
02:16:59,670 --> 02:17:01,050
Oh, here's the extraction point!

3079
02:17:01,170 --> 02:17:02,150
That's gonna be really annoying.

3080
02:17:02,370 --> 02:17:04,870
Oh, is it supposed to annoy the shit out of us when we're trying to get stuff here?

3081
02:17:05,410 --> 02:17:05,810
Probably.

3082
02:17:07,410 --> 02:17:08,730
I really hate that.

3083
02:17:08,810 --> 02:17:10,050
Oh, that's so evil!

3084
02:17:12,910 --> 02:17:14,550
A breathing pomegranate.

3085
02:17:14,890 --> 02:17:16,010
There's a first for everything.

3086
02:17:21,190 --> 02:17:21,970
What's that sound?

3087
02:17:22,510 --> 02:17:23,110
What's here?

3088
02:17:23,210 --> 02:17:23,650
I'm scared.

3089
02:17:26,930 --> 02:17:28,430
Matara found something.

3090
02:17:35,710 --> 02:17:37,330
Oh, you destroyed it?

3091
02:17:39,550 --> 02:17:40,910
You're so strong.

3092
02:17:43,450 --> 02:17:47,310
Wait, Matara's dead?

3093
02:17:47,310 --> 02:17:48,250
I'm screaming.

3094
02:17:48,750 --> 02:17:49,630
Oh no, you're fine.

3095
02:17:49,950 --> 02:17:50,450
We have to be careful.

3096
02:17:50,630 --> 02:17:53,990
There's an eye and a frog chef and a bunch of, like, the little exploding skull.

3097
02:17:54,630 --> 02:17:56,970
But the eye grabbed me and then I saw the frog chef.

3098
02:17:57,510 --> 02:17:59,010
Throw the exploding skulls at them.

3099
02:17:59,150 --> 02:17:59,750
It will be funny.

3100
02:17:59,870 --> 02:18:01,030
What do all those things do?

3101
02:18:02,470 --> 02:18:03,810
The exploding skulls explode.

3102
02:18:04,950 --> 02:18:08,530
But once they start exploding, I think you can throw them back and, like, run back.

3103
02:18:08,930 --> 02:18:09,250
Again?

3104
02:18:09,250 --> 02:18:13,630
The eye, if it catches you... So, if it catches you, you have to, like, break down and throw it behind a door.

3105
02:18:14,950 --> 02:18:15,590
And, um...

3106
02:18:15,590 --> 02:18:17,610
The frog chef will run at you with knives.

3107
02:18:17,710 --> 02:18:18,130
So, wait, wait, wait.

3108
02:18:18,150 --> 02:18:19,310
Cinder, can you help me put this in the car?

3109
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:25,700
Oh, what's that?

3110
02:18:31,450 --> 02:18:33,010
Oh, I can't get under the...

3111
02:18:33,510 --> 02:18:34,230
Oh, I think I'm dead.

3112
02:18:39,740 --> 02:18:40,160
What's up?

3113
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:42,780
Do you want to put the TV in?

3114
02:18:42,900 --> 02:18:43,360
Oh, fuck.

3115
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:46,900
Not if you slap me with a, like, a gramophone or whatever.

3116
02:18:47,460 --> 02:18:47,780
Sorry.

3117
02:18:49,300 --> 02:18:49,740
What?

3118
02:18:50,340 --> 02:18:52,080
Oh, that was one of the things exploding.

3119
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:54,500
It set me on fire.

3120
02:18:58,900 --> 02:19:00,900
There's a lot of stuff over there, Lime.

3121
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:01,500
Be careful.

3122
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:02,840
OK.

3123
02:19:28,540 --> 02:19:29,800
That wasn't for me.

3124
02:19:32,180 --> 02:19:32,620
Right?

3125
02:19:51,910 --> 02:19:54,750
I kind of ran to, like, a dead end.

3126
02:19:57,890 --> 02:19:58,250
Hmm.

3127
02:19:59,350 --> 02:20:01,370
So, um, I can't go pretty much anywhere.

3128
02:20:28,210 --> 02:20:29,390
Is anyone alive?

3129
02:20:30,970 --> 02:20:31,470
I don't know.

3130
02:20:31,590 --> 02:20:33,130
I think I heard Godzilla outside.

3131
02:20:33,270 --> 02:20:33,890
Yeah, me too.

3132
02:20:35,230 --> 02:20:35,590
Oh, shit.

3133
02:20:45,830 --> 02:20:47,690
That one's the break line of sight, right?

3134
02:20:48,930 --> 02:20:49,290
Yeah.

3135
02:20:50,970 --> 02:20:51,990
What was screaming?

3136
02:20:53,110 --> 02:20:53,770
I don't know.

3137
02:20:53,830 --> 02:20:54,190
Did you hear that?

3138
02:20:54,210 --> 02:20:55,070
Yeah, it sounded like Godzilla.

3139
02:20:55,530 --> 02:20:55,530
Yeah.

3140
02:20:56,190 --> 02:20:58,230
It was, like, screaming over and over again.

3141
02:20:58,910 --> 02:20:59,290
Yeah.

3142
02:21:00,650 --> 02:21:04,210
So, a little bit further ahead, there's, like, a scary...

3143
02:21:05,330 --> 02:21:05,790
A what?

3144
02:21:06,970 --> 02:21:09,010
It's, like, a... There's, like, a tombstone.

3145
02:21:09,250 --> 02:21:09,970
Oh, fun.

3146
02:21:11,170 --> 02:21:11,570
Yeah.

3147
02:21:12,690 --> 02:21:13,790
It was, like, freaking scary.

3148
02:21:14,350 --> 02:21:15,190
Oh, they're selling their stuff.

3149
02:21:15,190 --> 02:21:17,870
That's why I was out there when I was hearing, like, the screams.

3150
02:21:18,330 --> 02:21:19,010
I know.

3151
02:21:19,110 --> 02:21:19,790
I was just chilling.

3152
02:21:19,990 --> 02:21:21,030
I thought I was being haunted.

3153
02:21:22,470 --> 02:21:23,150
Not me.

3154
02:21:23,150 --> 02:21:24,650
Maybe I am right now.

3155
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:33,060
Lime, Mata, are you guys okay?

3156
02:21:33,800 --> 02:21:34,760
Mata's dead.

3157
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:42,400
Oopsie.

3158
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:49,520
We were hiding on the same shelf and it kind of, like, started walking past us and she panicked and jumped down and just got chased and died.

3159
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:49,960
What?

3160
02:21:50,420 --> 02:21:51,900
Why did she... Why...

3161
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:54,140
It's kind of scary.

3162
02:21:54,140 --> 02:21:56,720
Yeah, we broke some stuff trying to run away.

3163
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:57,400
It's okay.

3164
02:21:57,560 --> 02:21:58,780
Yeah, he actually...

3165
02:21:58,780 --> 02:22:02,940
He... He stood by the cart and broke a bunch of shit by charging into it over and over again.

3166
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,480
There's a lot of good stuff or... There's some stuff in here.

3167
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:06,720
I don't think we've been in...

3168
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:06,940
Okay.

3169
02:22:07,220 --> 02:22:08,040
Oh, there's something back here.

3170
02:22:08,980 --> 02:22:09,740
Behind the door.

3171
02:22:11,160 --> 02:22:14,280
Careful, careful, careful, careful, careful.

3172
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:15,540
Yay.

3173
02:22:16,660 --> 02:22:19,100
I kind of remember if you're not supposed to look at that one.

3174
02:22:19,180 --> 02:22:20,420
I never look at him just in case.

3175
02:22:21,020 --> 02:22:23,140
I know the other one you definitely can't look at.

3176
02:22:23,140 --> 02:22:23,840
Whoa.

3177
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:24,460
Okay.

3178
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:25,280
Ritual.

3179
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:27,080
Oh, I'm outside.

3180
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:29,600
Monkey.

3181
02:22:31,180 --> 02:22:33,040
It's so spooky out here.

3182
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:34,160
Yeah.

3183
02:22:35,460 --> 02:22:37,040
Oh, there's more over here.

3184
02:22:37,780 --> 02:22:38,300
Tombstone.

3185
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:38,720
Oh, wait.

3186
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:39,320
This looks like...

3187
02:22:40,300 --> 02:22:42,260
The thing that chased... That looks like grandpa.

3188
02:22:43,360 --> 02:22:44,300
There's more over here?

3189
02:22:44,620 --> 02:22:45,240
Oh, nice.

3190
02:22:46,540 --> 02:22:48,340
It's actually kind of peaceful.

3191
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:49,100
It is.

3192
02:22:49,140 --> 02:22:50,100
It feels nice out here.

3193
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:52,200
Like, I'll never get hurt.

3194
02:22:53,740 --> 02:22:54,300
Whoa.

3195
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:55,640
Yeah.

3196
02:23:00,370 --> 02:23:01,750
Traveling into the unknown.

3197
02:23:03,510 --> 02:23:04,330
By myself.

3198
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:09,610
And there's a whole...

3199
02:23:10,230 --> 02:23:11,050
Lot of nothing.

3200
02:23:12,390 --> 02:23:12,670
Maybe?

3201
02:23:13,550 --> 02:23:14,830
There's a whole lot of nothing.

3202
02:23:15,590 --> 02:23:17,610
I traveled here and it's literally...

3203
02:23:18,450 --> 02:23:19,070
A dead end.

3204
02:23:20,750 --> 02:23:22,290
You guys didn't see anything, right?

3205
02:23:24,550 --> 02:23:27,190
Grandpa died from falling down the stairs.

3206
02:23:27,390 --> 02:23:27,810
Well, good.

3207
02:23:27,910 --> 02:23:31,350
He murdered grandma by running over her with a reindeer.

3208
02:23:37,970 --> 02:23:39,210
Didn't see anything?

3209
02:23:39,550 --> 02:23:40,050
No.

3210
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:45,100
Okay, now I think I'm lost.

3211
02:23:47,620 --> 02:23:48,220
I

3212
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:56,520
found another extraction point.

3213
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:00,040
I found an extraction.

3214
02:24:00,520 --> 02:24:01,600
Oh, motherfuck.

3215
02:24:01,720 --> 02:24:02,520
Oh, that's good.

3216
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:04,080
If you go hit the button...

3217
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:06,120
No, you can't hit the button yet.

3218
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:06,820
I lied.

3219
02:24:07,380 --> 02:24:09,400
There's four of them in here.

3220
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,400
I'm just gonna spin and then...

3221
02:24:12,400 --> 02:24:14,500
Oh, I missed.

3222
02:24:15,020 --> 02:24:16,080
Spinning and then...

3223
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:18,280
There's a frog!

3224
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:20,720
You need some help?

3225
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:23,040
Oh, now I'm spinning.

3226
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:25,700
There we go.

3227
02:24:27,320 --> 02:24:27,840
Bullshit!

3228
02:24:28,260 --> 02:24:29,960
Move the cart out of the way!

3229
02:25:08,090 --> 02:25:09,990
So I think there's two of the fucking screaming guys.

3230
02:25:10,530 --> 02:25:11,770
What's the screaming guy?

3231
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:17,940
Once he falls over we might be able to lift him.

3232
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:18,940
Okay, okay.

3233
02:25:23,260 --> 02:25:24,840
He gotta fall over though.

3234
02:25:29,710 --> 02:25:30,530
Oh, you got him!

3235
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:32,230
Be careful, be careful.

3236
02:25:32,330 --> 02:25:33,350
I think I need help with it though.

3237
02:25:33,490 --> 02:25:33,950
Okay, okay.

3238
02:25:34,270 --> 02:25:34,410
Alright.

3239
02:25:35,330 --> 02:25:36,570
But it's very dangerous.

3240
02:25:36,710 --> 02:25:37,470
This is very dangerous.

3241
02:25:37,830 --> 02:25:38,850
We got this, we got this.

3242
02:25:39,190 --> 02:25:40,150
Oh, we might die though.

3243
02:25:40,590 --> 02:25:40,970
It's okay.

3244
02:25:40,970 --> 02:25:41,910
We got this.

3245
02:25:41,950 --> 02:25:43,690
It might be safer not to do that, honestly.

3246
02:25:44,510 --> 02:25:45,990
Wait for him to get bored and leave.

3247
02:25:46,190 --> 02:25:46,370
Okay.

3248
02:25:46,910 --> 02:25:48,030
I don't think he's gonna...

3249
02:25:48,030 --> 02:25:49,690
He keeps aggroing on me.

3250
02:25:51,130 --> 02:25:53,310
If you crouch, does he, like, lose interest?

3251
02:25:56,930 --> 02:25:57,650
He does!

3252
02:25:58,950 --> 02:25:59,350
Hell yeah.

3253
02:25:59,530 --> 02:26:01,130
Also, I think there's two big dudes.

3254
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:03,990
Because a big dude went sliding or gliding past me over there.

3255
02:26:04,290 --> 02:26:05,590
And then another one came in.

3256
02:26:06,150 --> 02:26:09,450
So unless you manage to go in a really quick loop-de-loop, there's two of them.

3257
02:26:09,450 --> 02:26:10,330
Oh no!

3258
02:26:11,250 --> 02:26:12,070
Motherfucker's back!

3259
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:14,650
I'm getting underneath the thing.

3260
02:26:15,110 --> 02:26:15,690
I'm up top.

3261
02:26:19,660 --> 02:26:20,700
Her head!

3262
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:26,120
Okay, he's definitely aggroed by the light, it seems.

3263
02:26:27,060 --> 02:26:27,300
Yeah.

3264
02:26:33,940 --> 02:26:34,460
Ouch!

3265
02:26:37,340 --> 02:26:37,580
Ouch!

3266
02:26:37,660 --> 02:26:37,880
Ouch!

3267
02:26:38,040 --> 02:26:38,160
Ouch!

3268
02:26:38,160 --> 02:26:38,260
Ouch!

3269
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:41,560
Are

3270
02:26:47,340 --> 02:26:48,340
you alive?

3271
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:50,860
Okay.

3272
02:27:02,210 --> 02:27:03,890
I'm coming to you.

3273
02:27:04,330 --> 02:27:04,870
Oh, nevermind.

3274
02:27:05,410 --> 02:27:06,190
We can lift him!

3275
02:27:06,430 --> 02:27:06,790
Lift him!

3276
02:27:07,090 --> 02:27:07,430
Lift him!

3277
02:27:07,710 --> 02:27:08,310
I

3278
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:15,340
can't see anything!

3279
02:27:26,990 --> 02:27:28,270
How did my safe...

3280
02:27:31,470 --> 02:27:32,470
What was that?

3281
02:27:39,660 --> 02:27:42,180
I saw a hand around the door!

3282
02:27:44,140 --> 02:27:45,080
Is that the...

3283
02:27:51,430 --> 02:27:52,530
I have 6 health.

3284
02:27:52,750 --> 02:27:54,250
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Limel.

3285
02:27:57,090 --> 02:27:58,170
I see him.

3286
02:28:02,890 --> 02:28:04,390
Did you grab Cinder's head?

3287
02:28:07,910 --> 02:28:09,210
Where the hell am I?

3288
02:28:12,830 --> 02:28:14,090
Limel, I'm lost.

3289
02:28:16,790 --> 02:28:17,410
Limel.

3290
02:28:18,990 --> 02:28:20,390
Oh, grandma's ashes.

3291
02:28:20,950 --> 02:28:22,710
Soon to be my ashes.

3292
02:28:23,650 --> 02:28:25,730
More like my asses.

3293
02:28:27,190 --> 02:28:28,270
Am I right?

3294
02:28:28,630 --> 02:28:30,730
Because my ass is grass.

3295
02:28:35,850 --> 02:28:39,190
Oh, where are you?

3296
02:28:39,510 --> 02:28:40,190
Oh, there you are.

3297
02:28:40,450 --> 02:28:40,770
I hear you.

3298
02:28:40,870 --> 02:28:41,230
I hear you.

3299
02:28:41,670 --> 02:28:42,710
I got lost for a second.

3300
02:28:43,810 --> 02:28:44,430
Okay.

3301
02:28:46,410 --> 02:28:46,930
Watch it.

3302
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:47,190
Watch it.

3303
02:28:47,210 --> 02:28:47,750
They're coming.

3304
02:28:51,190 --> 02:28:52,030
Throw him away.

3305
02:28:52,430 --> 02:28:53,030
Oh my God.

3306
02:28:53,050 --> 02:28:54,070
Is the frog here?

3307
02:28:59,070 --> 02:29:00,790
Is that all of our stuff?

3308
02:29:05,190 --> 02:29:06,070
Oh, it's D.

3309
02:29:07,170 --> 02:29:07,850
It's okay.

3310
02:29:08,650 --> 02:29:09,390
It's fine.

3311
02:29:09,490 --> 02:29:10,610
There's only like a thousand-ish.

3312
02:29:11,730 --> 02:29:12,690
This is still enough.

3313
02:29:12,790 --> 02:29:13,250
We need to find...

3314
02:29:14,170 --> 02:29:16,750
Mata's head was back at the beginning, right?

3315
02:29:17,130 --> 02:29:18,870
I don't know where she died, actually.

3316
02:29:19,790 --> 02:29:20,510
Oh, you don't know?

3317
02:29:20,550 --> 02:29:21,170
She died ages ago.

3318
02:29:21,250 --> 02:29:22,270
I put her body there.

3319
02:29:22,410 --> 02:29:22,710
We're fine.

3320
02:29:23,170 --> 02:29:23,590
We're fine.

3321
02:29:23,770 --> 02:29:24,630
Okay, okay, okay.

3322
02:29:24,850 --> 02:29:25,730
Everything's great.

3323
02:29:26,050 --> 02:29:27,370
I'm keeping watch out.

3324
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:36,540
And you guys, Cinder's head, okay.

3325
02:29:36,700 --> 02:29:37,840
We can still do this.

3326
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:40,000
Easy peasy.

3327
02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:42,100
I don't know about that, but...

3328
02:29:43,060 --> 02:29:44,260
Yeah, guys.

3329
02:29:44,600 --> 02:29:44,640
Yeah.

3330
02:29:46,140 --> 02:29:47,340
No problem.

3331
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:50,640
We only just make it here.

3332
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:53,560
Oh my gosh.

3333
02:29:54,140 --> 02:29:55,800
Oh my gosh.

3334
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:56,440
Like $200.

3335
02:29:57,160 --> 02:29:57,660
Barely.

3336
02:29:57,760 --> 02:29:58,040
Oh my gosh.

3337
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:00,360
$300.

3338
02:30:00,660 --> 02:30:01,080
Wow.

3339
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:05,920
It was less close and then it blew up half the loot.

3340
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:06,620
Yeah.

3341
02:30:07,560 --> 02:30:08,080
Welcome back.

3342
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:08,180
Welcome back.

3343
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,320
Look at this tiny little stack.

3344
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:13,280
It's so small.

3345
02:30:13,360 --> 02:30:13,960
It's so small.

3346
02:30:15,260 --> 02:30:16,840
Don't say those things about men.

3347
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:20,740
The effort.

3348
02:30:21,600 --> 02:30:22,160
Alright.

3349
02:30:22,480 --> 02:30:22,920
Let's go.

3350
02:30:24,040 --> 02:30:24,600
Sorry.

3351
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:27,440
Let's just...

3352
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:28,380
Wow.

3353
02:30:28,720 --> 02:30:29,280
Okay.

3354
02:30:31,020 --> 02:30:31,020
Let's go.

3355
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:31,960
Oh, I guess not.

3356
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:36,580
It's a how to paint a target on your back from three other people.

3357
02:30:36,580 --> 02:30:37,180
Yeah.

3358
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:37,700
What?

3359
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:38,240
No.

3360
02:30:38,820 --> 02:30:39,280
I remember...

3361
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:40,140
You guys love me.

3362
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:41,060
There's one...

3363
02:30:41,060 --> 02:30:43,200
Where was the other... Oh, did you find it?

3364
02:30:43,240 --> 02:30:44,040
You found it, right?

3365
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:47,080
Yeah, there was one kind of in the back that might be good to do.

3366
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:48,240
Okay.

3367
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:49,240
This way.

3368
02:30:57,720 --> 02:30:58,200
Hello?

3369
02:30:59,640 --> 02:31:00,760
I'll go press enter.

3370
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:04,980
I think if I remember how to get there.

3371
02:31:05,700 --> 02:31:06,780
I think I remember.

3372
02:31:08,460 --> 02:31:09,840
But, will I survive?

3373
02:31:10,320 --> 02:31:12,100
That's a better question.

3374
02:31:13,140 --> 02:31:13,700
Hi.

3375
02:31:13,940 --> 02:31:14,260
Hi.

3376
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:17,380
The tombstone area was where?

3377
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:18,100
Oh, maybe here?

3378
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:19,560
Yeah.

3379
02:31:19,800 --> 02:31:20,500
Oh yeah, I see it on the map.

3380
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:23,680
Yeah, right here.

3381
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:24,140
Right here.

3382
02:31:27,880 --> 02:31:28,240
Oh.

3383
02:31:30,700 --> 02:31:32,160
Why did she do that?

3384
02:31:34,700 --> 02:31:35,260
Matarikon!

3385
02:31:36,780 --> 02:31:37,560
Matarikon, why?

3386
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:42,340
She knew that we were going that way.

3387
02:31:43,220 --> 02:31:45,700
It's like years away too, okay?

3388
02:31:52,050 --> 02:31:52,350
This way?

3389
02:31:55,230 --> 02:31:56,930
That pinky is starting to hurt.

3390
02:31:57,130 --> 02:31:57,250
Hello.

3391
02:31:57,930 --> 02:32:00,890
I activated the one next to the base, like a dummy.

3392
02:32:01,790 --> 02:32:03,150
Yeah, why'd you do that?

3393
02:32:03,210 --> 02:32:04,350
Why did you do that?

3394
02:32:05,190 --> 02:32:07,050
Yep, I'm sorry.

3395
02:32:07,510 --> 02:32:09,370
It was a brain empty moment.

3396
02:32:09,690 --> 02:32:11,350
She's throwing, guys.

3397
02:32:11,470 --> 02:32:12,810
Did anybody take double jumps?

3398
02:32:13,010 --> 02:32:13,910
I bet you guys were okay.

3399
02:32:13,910 --> 02:32:16,110
No, I can try to get something.

3400
02:32:19,650 --> 02:32:20,810
Double jump.

3401
02:32:22,070 --> 02:32:24,290
Oh, there's a little skull guy.

3402
02:32:24,890 --> 02:32:25,850
Oh, they're on fire.

3403
02:32:27,030 --> 02:32:29,910
Frog is coming behind you, Cinder.

3404
02:32:31,050 --> 02:32:32,150
Careful, careful.

3405
02:32:32,710 --> 02:32:33,350
I won't.

3406
02:32:33,890 --> 02:32:34,770
I won't explode.

3407
02:32:40,030 --> 02:32:41,870
Who dropped your crown?

3408
02:32:45,050 --> 02:32:45,690
Queen.

3409
02:32:46,090 --> 02:32:48,690
Careful, the frog will break that stuff.

3410
02:32:49,010 --> 02:32:49,290
Yeah.

3411
02:32:52,930 --> 02:32:53,770
Let's see.

3412
02:32:54,570 --> 02:32:55,550
Oh, there's more in here.

3413
02:32:58,450 --> 02:32:59,090
Okay.

3414
02:33:03,450 --> 02:33:04,770
Where am I taking it?

3415
02:33:07,170 --> 02:33:09,030
You wanna bring the cart into where?

3416
02:33:11,090 --> 02:33:11,730
Here?

3417
02:33:12,110 --> 02:33:12,490
There?

3418
02:33:13,050 --> 02:33:13,570
Here?

3419
02:33:15,990 --> 02:33:16,270
Here?

3420
02:33:17,230 --> 02:33:18,390
I need you to do...

3421
02:33:18,390 --> 02:33:19,370
I need you to do...

3422
02:33:19,370 --> 02:33:20,350
I have one health.

3423
02:33:20,930 --> 02:33:21,830
Where is it?

3424
02:33:26,800 --> 02:33:28,020
Is there anything up here?

3425
02:33:33,020 --> 02:33:33,380
Nothing.

3426
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:40,790
Grab him.

3427
02:33:41,870 --> 02:33:42,350
Grab him.

3428
02:33:42,510 --> 02:33:42,930
Oh, fuck.

3429
02:33:43,210 --> 02:33:44,170
Oh, it's kind of fading.

3430
02:33:44,530 --> 02:33:45,710
It's okay, I think you can grab him.

3431
02:33:45,830 --> 02:33:46,850
Go, go, go, grab him.

3432
02:33:46,850 --> 02:33:48,330
Up, down.

3433
02:33:48,490 --> 02:33:49,130
I don't think it's...

3434
02:33:49,130 --> 02:33:50,090
Up, up, down.

3435
02:33:50,210 --> 02:33:50,570
Down.

3436
02:33:50,750 --> 02:33:51,930
Up, up, down.

3437
02:33:52,070 --> 02:33:52,410
Down.

3438
02:33:52,590 --> 02:33:53,790
Up, up, down.

3439
02:33:53,930 --> 02:33:54,270
Down.

3440
02:33:54,430 --> 02:33:55,570
I can't grab him.

3441
02:33:55,810 --> 02:33:56,110
Down.

3442
02:33:56,690 --> 02:33:57,010
Up.

3443
02:33:57,530 --> 02:33:57,970
Up.

3444
02:33:58,310 --> 02:33:58,710
Up.

3445
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:07,600
Down.

3446
02:34:07,980 --> 02:34:08,500
Up.

3447
02:34:08,820 --> 02:34:09,000
Up.

3448
02:34:09,220 --> 02:34:09,780
Down.

3449
02:34:11,560 --> 02:34:14,900
Mint, it will break in one hit.

3450
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:16,100
Okay, okay, okay.

3451
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:18,340
Oh my God.

3452
02:34:18,620 --> 02:34:20,000
Place it gently in the cart.

3453
02:34:20,280 --> 02:34:20,520
Gently.

3454
02:34:21,880 --> 02:34:23,000
Up, down.

3455
02:34:24,660 --> 02:34:24,980
Down.

3456
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:25,820
Okay.

3457
02:34:26,160 --> 02:34:26,440
Three.

3458
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:29,240
Sorry, Cinder.

3459
02:34:29,960 --> 02:34:31,660
But there is loot up there.

3460
02:34:31,720 --> 02:34:32,780
I don't know if you can get it though.

3461
02:34:32,940 --> 02:34:33,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3462
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:34,500
I can use...

3463
02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:35,380
Throw me, throw me limes.

3464
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:36,360
Okay.

3465
02:34:36,420 --> 02:34:37,640
Throw me to the wolves.

3466
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:39,800
As Bao would say and she would come back pregnant.

3467
02:34:42,340 --> 02:34:42,860
She won.

3468
02:34:43,480 --> 02:34:44,640
Hold on, let me use a bed.

3469
02:34:44,660 --> 02:34:45,300
Yeah, get on the bed.

3470
02:34:45,340 --> 02:34:46,280
I'm finding all these tiny things.

3471
02:34:47,320 --> 02:34:47,940
Oh, ouch.

3472
02:34:48,180 --> 02:34:48,620
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3473
02:34:50,380 --> 02:34:51,420
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3474
02:34:51,560 --> 02:34:52,420
Release me, release me.

3475
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:53,840
Let me go, let me go.

3476
02:34:54,260 --> 02:34:54,540
Yeah.

3477
02:34:55,480 --> 02:34:56,760
She doesn't want to let you go.

3478
02:34:56,860 --> 02:34:57,620
Oh, fuck.

3479
02:34:58,280 --> 02:34:59,400
Can you put me back up?

3480
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:01,660
Oh, this is where I was hiding before.

3481
02:35:03,180 --> 02:35:04,280
Come on, Matara.

3482
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:05,820
Concentrate.

3483
02:35:05,940 --> 02:35:07,820
This is serious business here.

3484
02:35:07,860 --> 02:35:08,720
Let me go, let me go, let me go.

3485
02:35:10,420 --> 02:35:10,800
Nice.

3486
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:17,480
Oh, basement.

3487
02:35:18,440 --> 02:35:22,340
Oh, there is another extraction in the basement.

3488
02:35:26,780 --> 02:35:27,160
Okay.

3489
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:29,800
Limes, do you mind putting me up to this, to the right side?

3490
02:35:29,940 --> 02:35:32,040
Like, to the other side that you put me in initially.

3491
02:35:32,100 --> 02:35:34,240
Is there grandma's ashes up there or...

3492
02:35:36,060 --> 02:35:37,220
Yeah, yeah, put me up here.

3493
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:40,880
Oh, it's this room then, I think.

3494
02:35:46,630 --> 02:35:47,270
This one.

3495
02:35:48,210 --> 02:35:49,490
Do you think I can do it on my own?

3496
02:35:57,900 --> 02:35:58,540
We'll wait.

3497
02:36:03,980 --> 02:36:06,320
Don't worry about it.

3498
02:36:08,420 --> 02:36:10,020
Wait, I can open this, though.

3499
02:36:12,420 --> 02:36:13,640
Tiny item.

3500
02:36:15,500 --> 02:36:16,640
Monkey item.

3501
02:36:17,900 --> 02:36:18,740
Oops, Minky.

3502
02:36:21,540 --> 02:36:23,120
Minky, Minky.

3503
02:36:23,900 --> 02:36:24,800
Minky, Minky.

3504
02:36:25,180 --> 02:36:26,000
Hello?

3505
02:36:45,750 --> 02:36:46,170
Hello?

3506
02:36:47,670 --> 02:36:48,770
Okay, could you...

3507
02:36:48,770 --> 02:36:51,830
Limes, could you throw Mint to the level where I was at so I can...

3508
02:36:52,590 --> 02:36:56,230
Okay, be careful because the two creepy guys are still around.

3509
02:36:57,070 --> 02:36:58,910
One of them almost died to the bombs.

3510
02:36:59,010 --> 02:37:00,330
He was on the floor crying, it was great.

3511
02:37:00,550 --> 02:37:01,850
Mint, fold yourself down.

3512
02:37:02,530 --> 02:37:02,790
Rescue.

3513
02:37:03,910 --> 02:37:05,050
Okay, which side do you want her?

3514
02:37:05,970 --> 02:37:07,200
The side where I...

3515
02:37:07,710 --> 02:37:08,250
Oh, fuck!

3516
02:37:09,190 --> 02:37:09,870
Oh no.

3517
02:37:10,370 --> 02:37:10,410
Sorry.

3518
02:37:10,970 --> 02:37:11,690
Yeah, I'm sorry.

3519
02:37:12,930 --> 02:37:14,490
I'll put Mint up to go get that.

3520
02:37:15,370 --> 02:37:16,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3521
02:37:16,390 --> 02:37:17,070
What am I getting?

3522
02:37:18,170 --> 02:37:19,750
There's like an item...

3523
02:37:19,750 --> 02:37:20,670
Oh, I see him, I see him, I see him.

3524
02:37:20,790 --> 02:37:21,550
There's a million...

3525
02:37:21,550 --> 02:37:22,690
Can you lift me up, too?

3526
02:37:22,710 --> 02:37:24,410
Because we'll need two people up top.

3527
02:37:25,350 --> 02:37:26,270
This is fun.

3528
02:37:26,510 --> 02:37:28,750
I'm throwing up a little clown.

3529
02:37:29,570 --> 02:37:30,570
Yeah, careful, careful.

3530
02:37:30,690 --> 02:37:31,570
Let me put Montauk first.

3531
02:37:31,730 --> 02:37:31,990
Okay.

3532
02:37:33,630 --> 02:37:35,290
I think you have to go through the side.

3533
02:37:35,310 --> 02:37:35,930
It's gonna be easier.

3534
02:37:36,090 --> 02:37:37,770
Which one is Montauk on?

3535
02:37:38,470 --> 02:37:39,370
Which one is Montauk on?

3536
02:37:39,370 --> 02:37:42,050
Which one is Montauk on?

3537
02:37:42,090 --> 02:37:43,370
Can you guys tell the difference?

3538
02:37:43,670 --> 02:37:44,470
Give me the clown.

3539
02:37:45,050 --> 02:37:45,890
Which one?

3540
02:37:47,550 --> 02:37:48,610
It's gonna poop its nose.

3541
02:37:48,810 --> 02:37:49,070
There you go.

3542
02:37:49,170 --> 02:37:50,530
Okay, so Minty, stay there.

3543
02:37:50,610 --> 02:37:50,850
Okay.

3544
02:37:51,110 --> 02:37:52,330
And then I will...

3545
02:37:52,330 --> 02:37:53,590
Sorry, nevermind.

3546
02:37:53,810 --> 02:37:53,950
No!

3547
02:37:54,890 --> 02:37:55,310
Montauk!

3548
02:37:56,790 --> 02:37:57,210
Sorry.

3549
02:37:57,870 --> 02:38:01,430
How did the explosion not break the soul of the monster?

3550
02:38:01,670 --> 02:38:02,170
That's weird.

3551
02:38:02,590 --> 02:38:06,130
I'm gonna move this cart over here as well just in case they decide to come running in again.

3552
02:38:06,130 --> 02:38:10,570
I'm gonna try and jump to the third... Wait, can you climb up it or no?

3553
02:38:10,870 --> 02:38:11,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can't climb.

3554
02:38:11,830 --> 02:38:14,290
Well, if I put Matara up there, she can lift you.

3555
02:38:14,670 --> 02:38:14,930
Oh.

3556
02:38:15,250 --> 02:38:15,470
Yeah.

3557
02:38:15,610 --> 02:38:16,530
I think I just fell.

3558
02:38:16,970 --> 02:38:17,830
Wait, where am I?

3559
02:38:18,410 --> 02:38:20,450
Somebody said maybe I should let Limes do it.

3560
02:38:21,910 --> 02:38:23,970
Wait, hold on, hold on.

3561
02:38:24,210 --> 02:38:24,970
I'm going back up.

3562
02:38:27,690 --> 02:38:29,010
You have to do it through this side, yeah.

3563
02:38:29,330 --> 02:38:30,010
What the heck?

3564
02:38:30,670 --> 02:38:31,770
A little bit higher?

3565
02:38:32,070 --> 02:38:32,710
Yeah, you're amazing.

3566
02:38:32,730 --> 02:38:33,770
Okay, I'm at the top.

3567
02:38:33,910 --> 02:38:34,270
Thank you.

3568
02:38:34,690 --> 02:38:35,170
Oh, I just...

3569
02:38:35,170 --> 02:38:35,650
Hooray!

3570
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:38,050
Okay, do it like to me to you.

3571
02:38:38,090 --> 02:38:38,430
So Mint...

3572
02:38:38,430 --> 02:38:39,250
This is expensive.

3573
02:38:39,310 --> 02:38:40,970
Yeah, so... I know, I know.

3574
02:38:41,030 --> 02:38:42,290
That's why I wanted some help.

3575
02:38:43,190 --> 02:38:43,830
Grab it.

3576
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:46,470
Okay.

3577
02:38:47,030 --> 02:38:50,170
I don't know how we're gonna do this, but...

3578
02:38:52,890 --> 02:38:53,430
Okay, it's okay.

3579
02:38:54,290 --> 02:38:55,370
Mint, Mint, Mint, put it with me.

3580
02:38:55,510 --> 02:38:55,990
Grab it with me.

3581
02:38:56,190 --> 02:38:57,050
Just like this way.

3582
02:38:57,170 --> 02:38:57,610
I got it.

3583
02:38:59,070 --> 02:38:59,930
It's not moving.

3584
02:39:00,850 --> 02:39:01,810
Yeah, it's not moving.

3585
02:39:01,810 --> 02:39:02,630
It's not moving.

3586
02:39:02,850 --> 02:39:03,370
Put it up a little.

3587
02:39:03,530 --> 02:39:04,290
Put it up a bit.

3588
02:39:06,370 --> 02:39:08,730
It's like one point just... Yeah, okay.

3589
02:39:09,950 --> 02:39:12,150
Can we slide it down the thing?

3590
02:39:12,570 --> 02:39:13,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3591
02:39:13,410 --> 02:39:13,830
Let me...

3592
02:39:13,830 --> 02:39:13,930
Okay.

3593
02:39:14,090 --> 02:39:14,750
Okay, yeah.

3594
02:39:15,010 --> 02:39:15,450
There you go.

3595
02:39:15,930 --> 02:39:15,950
Yeah.

3596
02:39:15,950 --> 02:39:16,150
Yeah.

3597
02:39:20,030 --> 02:39:22,030
Think about every move you've ever done.

3598
02:39:22,130 --> 02:39:23,050
Hold on, I gotta...

3599
02:39:23,050 --> 02:39:23,790
I might be dead.

3600
02:39:24,310 --> 02:39:24,550
What?

3601
02:39:24,770 --> 02:39:25,210
What do you mean?

3602
02:39:26,250 --> 02:39:31,330
There's a lot of explosive skulls about to explode underneath me and I can't jump down to deal with them because they'll explode.

3603
02:39:32,730 --> 02:39:34,370
Oh my god, did they get the fucking cart?

3604
02:39:34,830 --> 02:39:36,130
No, no, no, no, no.

3605
02:39:36,130 --> 02:39:36,670
No, they didn't.

3606
02:39:36,730 --> 02:39:36,910
Okay.

3607
02:39:37,170 --> 02:39:38,210
They wouldn't do that.

3608
02:39:38,230 --> 02:39:38,750
It was forced.

3609
02:39:39,230 --> 02:39:39,450
I would've been so mad.

3610
02:39:39,450 --> 02:39:43,590
I need to throw you up there because there's a pink and a mint.

3611
02:39:44,170 --> 02:39:45,730
Like a mint...

3612
02:39:45,730 --> 02:39:45,890
I'm weak.

3613
02:39:46,030 --> 02:39:47,310
I have spaghetti arms.

3614
02:39:47,610 --> 02:39:49,950
We need a sexy, sexy strong girl.

3615
02:39:50,270 --> 02:39:54,230
Wait, why don't you both go up because I don't have any strength enhancements.

3616
02:39:54,310 --> 02:39:54,890
Both of you do.

3617
02:39:55,110 --> 02:39:57,270
Mata doesn't either because we forgot to buy it.

3618
02:39:57,390 --> 02:39:58,130
Oh, that's right.

3619
02:40:00,030 --> 02:40:01,730
I can bring the cart back out.

3620
02:40:01,730 --> 02:40:04,090
I'm sorry, is Cinder just watching us do this whole thing?

3621
02:40:04,450 --> 02:40:05,350
Sorry, Cinder.

3622
02:40:05,670 --> 02:40:07,070
She's probably screaming like...

3623
02:40:07,070 --> 02:40:08,530
Move it this way.

3624
02:40:09,070 --> 02:40:10,650
Oh, I see.

3625
02:40:10,670 --> 02:40:12,110
I didn't realize that was the painting.

3626
02:40:12,290 --> 02:40:12,670
Yeah.

3627
02:40:12,950 --> 02:40:13,950
This is gonna be fucked.

3628
02:40:15,290 --> 02:40:16,590
We gotta Tetris it.

3629
02:40:16,610 --> 02:40:17,010
Let's see.

3630
02:40:17,870 --> 02:40:19,730
What if we just drop the painting on the floor?

3631
02:40:20,090 --> 02:40:22,190
We're gonna lose a lot, but...

3632
02:40:22,190 --> 02:40:22,650
No, hold on.

3633
02:40:22,730 --> 02:40:24,050
It's kind of... You wedged it.

3634
02:40:24,210 --> 02:40:25,330
I just dropped on the floor.

3635
02:40:25,450 --> 02:40:30,110
If you show me where the painting is, I can bring the cart sort of under it.

3636
02:40:31,210 --> 02:40:33,510
It's like right here, though.

3637
02:40:35,990 --> 02:40:38,190
It's kind of difficult, I think.

3638
02:40:39,350 --> 02:40:42,210
I think it's a... You gotta drag... It's not a... I don't think it's a cart.

3639
02:40:42,250 --> 02:40:42,490
Yeah, I see.

3640
02:40:42,630 --> 02:40:42,910
I see.

3641
02:40:43,010 --> 02:40:43,350
I see.

3642
02:40:44,250 --> 02:40:45,330
The scary man.

3643
02:40:45,550 --> 02:40:46,170
The scary man.

3644
02:40:46,810 --> 02:40:47,330
Look away.

3645
02:40:53,240 --> 02:40:54,300
The Ooga Booga Man.

3646
02:40:54,320 --> 02:40:55,380
Are you guys both okay?

3647
02:40:56,560 --> 02:40:58,000
Yeah, he just Ooga Booga'd a little.

3648
02:40:59,460 --> 02:41:00,440
He's like screaming.

3649
02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:00,900
You hear him?

3650
02:41:02,580 --> 02:41:02,980
Yep.

3651
02:41:03,360 --> 02:41:04,880
I'm not gonna drop down until he leaves.

3652
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:06,260
Yeah, do not.

3653
02:41:06,360 --> 02:41:06,680
Do not.

3654
02:41:06,800 --> 02:41:07,140
Do not.

3655
02:41:09,160 --> 02:41:09,940
Is he still there?

3656
02:41:12,420 --> 02:41:13,660
I don't see him.

3657
02:41:14,580 --> 02:41:14,860
Do you?

3658
02:41:15,700 --> 02:41:16,780
What just lost money?

3659
02:41:18,500 --> 02:41:19,200
It's just her.

3660
02:41:19,320 --> 02:41:19,460
It's her.

3661
02:41:19,560 --> 02:41:19,740
It's her.

3662
02:41:19,840 --> 02:41:20,220
Okay, good.

3663
02:41:20,300 --> 02:41:20,380
Good.

3664
02:41:20,420 --> 02:41:20,520
Good.

3665
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:20,680
Good.

3666
02:41:20,780 --> 02:41:21,940
Oh, it's just her.

3667
02:41:22,520 --> 02:41:23,360
There you go.

3668
02:41:24,100 --> 02:41:24,500
Nice!

3669
02:41:24,600 --> 02:41:24,800
Okay.

3670
02:41:26,500 --> 02:41:30,220
Okay, Cinder's head is a good resting point.

3671
02:41:30,220 --> 02:41:32,000
We should get to the extraction point with this, please.

3672
02:41:32,200 --> 02:41:32,200
Yeah.

3673
02:41:32,360 --> 02:41:32,720
Yeah.

3674
02:41:32,720 --> 02:41:33,020
Yeah.

3675
02:41:33,020 --> 02:41:33,200
Yeah.

3676
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:33,480
Yeah.

3677
02:41:34,100 --> 02:41:34,800
Yeah, we do.

3678
02:41:35,780 --> 02:41:37,220
This does not count as in the cart.

3679
02:41:37,300 --> 02:41:38,000
This is kind of fucked.

3680
02:41:38,140 --> 02:41:39,160
I'm gonna have to carry this separately.

3681
02:41:39,500 --> 02:41:39,900
Yeah, I'll carry it.

3682
02:41:39,980 --> 02:41:40,440
I'll carry it.

3683
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:40,860
Yeah, yeah.

3684
02:41:41,040 --> 02:41:41,940
It's kind of heavy.

3685
02:41:42,680 --> 02:41:44,140
I'll actually... how much cart do you have?

3686
02:41:44,300 --> 02:41:45,560
I'll put it right next to us.

3687
02:41:46,060 --> 02:41:47,540
So there's an extraction point here after.

3688
02:41:47,960 --> 02:41:48,980
Yeah, it's the one in the basement.

3689
02:41:49,260 --> 02:41:51,440
Wait, there's no... I wouldn't do this one.

3690
02:41:51,520 --> 02:41:52,520
I wouldn't do this one, Matara.

3691
02:41:53,180 --> 02:41:54,200
There's a further one away.

3692
02:41:54,320 --> 02:41:55,140
There's a further one away.

3693
02:41:55,840 --> 02:41:57,900
So just leave it... just leave it here for now.

3694
02:41:58,840 --> 02:42:00,080
We need something else then?

3695
02:42:00,460 --> 02:42:03,000
I can't believe you just stared at me while...

3696
02:42:04,040 --> 02:42:05,920
Yeah, um, bring...

3697
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:07,060
Sorry, I stared at who?

3698
02:42:07,180 --> 02:42:07,340
What?

3699
02:42:09,260 --> 02:42:09,660
Nevermind.

3700
02:42:11,540 --> 02:42:13,440
We need to leave the painting here then.

3701
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:16,800
But we need to get something else to have enough for the extraction point.

3702
02:42:16,820 --> 02:42:18,540
If you throw me back up, there's a few more things.

3703
02:42:19,280 --> 02:42:19,960
Small things.

3704
02:42:20,580 --> 02:42:22,860
You can also... I actually parkoured up here earlier.

3705
02:42:23,440 --> 02:42:23,960
Oh, really?

3706
02:42:23,960 --> 02:42:24,100
Really?

3707
02:42:25,460 --> 02:42:28,140
Yeah, I jumped like from there onto it.

3708
02:42:29,680 --> 02:42:31,160
I really think... hold on, Limes.

3709
02:42:31,240 --> 02:42:31,840
Get small.

3710
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:32,640
I'll just bring you up.

3711
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:33,320
It's so much easier.

3712
02:42:34,100 --> 02:42:34,860
Put Mint up.

3713
02:42:34,900 --> 02:42:35,720
I want to try it again.

3714
02:42:36,440 --> 02:42:37,580
Okay, Mint, get Q.

3715
02:42:37,980 --> 02:42:38,700
Hold on.

3716
02:42:39,580 --> 02:42:40,100
Um, Q.

3717
02:42:42,640 --> 02:42:43,240
Hold on.

3718
02:42:44,120 --> 02:42:44,920
Don't move.

3719
02:42:45,080 --> 02:42:45,400
Don't move.

3720
02:42:46,140 --> 02:42:47,900
Okay, don't move.

3721
02:42:48,460 --> 02:42:49,220
Don't hurt me.

3722
02:42:50,320 --> 02:42:52,440
I already emotionally have done it.

3723
02:42:52,440 --> 02:42:53,580
Oh my god, you're the best.

3724
02:42:55,860 --> 02:42:57,900
Although it's kind of funky to get onto a bed.

3725
02:42:57,960 --> 02:42:59,500
Why did you put me on this side?

3726
02:42:59,820 --> 02:43:00,600
Is there anything over here?

3727
02:43:00,840 --> 02:43:01,560
Get back up.

3728
02:43:01,660 --> 02:43:02,340
Get back down then.

3729
02:43:02,440 --> 02:43:02,860
Wait, hold on.

3730
02:43:02,900 --> 02:43:03,900
I think I can parkour.

3731
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:04,800
Just kidding.

3732
02:43:06,520 --> 02:43:06,880
Rescue.

3733
02:43:12,610 --> 02:43:13,510
Isn't this fun?

3734
02:43:13,610 --> 02:43:14,190
These adventures?

3735
02:43:15,810 --> 02:43:16,970
Oh my god, look at her.

3736
02:43:18,070 --> 02:43:19,410
Put me on the bed.

3737
02:43:19,570 --> 02:43:21,530
She put me on the bed, girl.

3738
02:43:21,990 --> 02:43:22,430
Oh.

3739
02:43:23,910 --> 02:43:25,610
She's throwing me around, girl.

3740
02:43:25,750 --> 02:43:27,530
Like I'm a little ragdoll, girl.

3741
02:43:27,790 --> 02:43:28,810
Ragdoll, ragdoll.

3742
02:43:31,130 --> 02:43:32,510
Stop, you're making me laugh.

3743
02:43:32,750 --> 02:43:32,990
Stop.

3744
02:43:33,310 --> 02:43:34,870
Come on, put it in.

3745
02:43:34,930 --> 02:43:35,570
I mean, wait.

3746
02:43:40,190 --> 02:43:41,070
Come on.

3747
02:43:41,430 --> 02:43:41,790
The bed.

3748
02:43:43,090 --> 02:43:43,490
The bed.

3749
02:43:43,930 --> 02:43:44,230
The bed.

3750
02:43:44,870 --> 02:43:47,050
You put me in the worst spot.

3751
02:43:48,150 --> 02:43:48,910
Was there really anything?

3752
02:43:48,910 --> 02:43:49,090
Yeah.

3753
02:43:49,550 --> 02:43:51,450
Open the cupboards.

3754
02:43:52,590 --> 02:43:53,330
What cupboards?

3755
02:44:02,420 --> 02:44:03,780
She's already half dead again.

3756
02:44:04,100 --> 02:44:05,200
I half killed her.

3757
02:44:10,310 --> 02:44:10,950
Parkour.

3758
02:44:13,090 --> 02:44:16,350
My grandma died long before I decided to be a streamer.

3759
02:44:16,410 --> 02:44:17,130
She doesn't care.

3760
02:44:17,930 --> 02:44:18,970
She died because you...

3761
02:44:20,370 --> 02:44:21,270
It's fine.

3762
02:44:21,270 --> 02:44:23,030
She died because you didn't learn your native tongue.

3763
02:44:23,390 --> 02:44:25,530
I need...

3764
02:44:28,790 --> 02:44:31,090
I'm not going down.

3765
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:36,400
Are you okay?

3766
02:44:38,620 --> 02:44:39,620
Did Lime die?

3767
02:44:40,460 --> 02:44:41,520
No way!

3768
02:44:45,080 --> 02:44:47,240
Your mic is cutting out, Matara.

3769
02:44:47,940 --> 02:44:49,520
Oh, it's because I scream so loud.

3770
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:50,900
Come on.

3771
02:44:51,980 --> 02:44:52,480
It's okay.

3772
02:44:53,740 --> 02:44:54,300
Mint?

3773
02:44:55,280 --> 02:44:57,360
We could bring this...

3774
02:44:57,360 --> 02:44:59,020
I guess we now need to...

3775
02:44:59,020 --> 02:44:59,940
Oh, fuck, and the frog.

3776
02:45:00,200 --> 02:45:00,440
Bitch.

3777
02:45:03,080 --> 02:45:04,360
I have an idea.

3778
02:45:04,520 --> 02:45:05,220
Press escape.

3779
02:45:05,820 --> 02:45:06,300
Escape?

3780
02:45:07,380 --> 02:45:08,760
Yeah, and go into self-destruct.

3781
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:09,580
Why?

3782
02:45:10,220 --> 02:45:11,420
Just do it.

3783
02:45:11,780 --> 02:45:12,120
Why?

3784
02:45:12,760 --> 02:45:13,480
Do it.

3785
02:45:14,840 --> 02:45:16,640
I promise you.

3786
02:45:16,640 --> 02:45:18,960
Wait, something is looking at me.

3787
02:45:20,080 --> 02:45:21,780
Wait, why are we self-destructing?

3788
02:45:22,400 --> 02:45:22,760
Do it, Mint.

3789
02:45:22,820 --> 02:45:23,140
Do it, Mint.

3790
02:45:23,860 --> 02:45:24,340
No!

3791
02:45:25,300 --> 02:45:25,940
Do it!

3792
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:27,480
Okay.

3793
02:45:27,820 --> 02:45:28,360
Do it, Mint!

3794
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:29,380
Kill yourself!

3795
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:30,100
Okay!

3796
02:45:35,890 --> 02:45:37,150
What does she mean perfect?

3797
02:45:39,710 --> 02:45:40,950
You're the worst.

3798
02:45:41,310 --> 02:45:42,450
I'm sorry!

3799
02:45:43,750 --> 02:45:46,890
Wow, not even the urge to try to come and clutch.

3800
02:45:46,890 --> 02:45:48,130
Wait, you didn't wait.

3801
02:45:48,230 --> 02:45:49,050
What was this?

3802
02:45:49,290 --> 02:45:50,690
I thought you had a plan!

3803
02:45:51,330 --> 02:45:53,370
I thought you had a plan!

3804
02:45:58,550 --> 02:46:00,890
Every android for themselves.

3805
02:46:01,210 --> 02:46:01,810
What is this?

3806
02:46:01,870 --> 02:46:03,050
Everyone attack Matara!

3807
02:46:04,150 --> 02:46:05,290
Get Matara!

3808
02:46:05,450 --> 02:46:06,630
Get Matara!

3809
02:46:09,810 --> 02:46:11,190
She's just laughing.

3810
02:46:13,750 --> 02:46:15,450
She's just laughing.

3811
02:46:15,450 --> 02:46:18,010
She's just...this is insane.

3812
02:46:18,350 --> 02:46:19,730
She's just laughing.

3813
02:46:32,840 --> 02:46:33,600
I've

3814
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:48,920
got the sword that's maybe useless.

3815
02:46:52,100 --> 02:46:53,240
I got

3816
02:47:10,830 --> 02:47:10,930
it!

3817
02:47:15,910 --> 02:47:17,790
Cinder is the biggest loser!

3818
02:47:18,110 --> 02:47:19,150
Cinder is the biggest loser!

3819
02:47:22,370 --> 02:47:23,850
I was so close!

3820
02:47:24,690 --> 02:47:25,550
That was crazy.

3821
02:47:30,630 --> 02:47:32,750
I wanted to be the biggest loser.

3822
02:47:33,850 --> 02:47:34,570
Oh, hello?

3823
02:47:35,330 --> 02:47:37,510
All things considered, we got pretty far.

3824
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:39,290
Yeah, actually.

3825
02:47:41,610 --> 02:47:42,130
Hello?

3826
02:47:42,650 --> 02:47:43,630
Can everybody load back in?

3827
02:47:44,690 --> 02:47:45,370
Hey, I'm back.

3828
02:47:45,470 --> 02:47:46,650
Sorry, Matara went to get water.

3829
02:47:47,010 --> 02:47:47,370
Okay.

3830
02:47:47,790 --> 02:47:48,670
Oh, okay.

3831
02:47:49,590 --> 02:47:50,470
Sounds good.

3832
02:47:50,470 --> 02:47:51,870
Yeah, we got pretty far, no?

3833
02:47:52,470 --> 02:47:53,050
We did.

3834
02:47:53,410 --> 02:47:56,510
I can go for another 40 minutes if we want to do another...

3835
02:47:56,510 --> 02:47:58,010
Sorry, I went like super British for that one.

3836
02:47:58,050 --> 02:47:58,390
That was weird.

3837
02:47:58,910 --> 02:48:03,530
I can go for another 40 minutes if we want to do that.

3838
02:48:04,390 --> 02:48:05,910
We can do another one.

3839
02:48:06,410 --> 02:48:07,570
Yeah, sounds good to me.

3840
02:48:07,570 --> 02:48:08,230
Up to you guys.

3841
02:48:08,430 --> 02:48:08,710
Yeah.

3842
02:48:09,410 --> 02:48:09,810
Okay.

3843
02:48:11,290 --> 02:48:15,890
You know, I think this is the farthest I've gotten, like, most rounds without dying.

3844
02:48:15,950 --> 02:48:16,890
We're so competent.

3845
02:48:17,910 --> 02:48:18,810
We did a good job.

3846
02:48:18,810 --> 02:48:20,710
This is like the dream team, you guys.

3847
02:48:20,750 --> 02:48:21,170
I know.

3848
02:48:21,410 --> 02:48:21,810
Oh my god.

3849
02:48:21,850 --> 02:48:24,870
We could've gone further, but Matara decided to just end it all, I guess.

3850
02:48:24,890 --> 02:48:27,010
I didn't... I feel such a fool.

3851
02:48:27,250 --> 02:48:28,230
I thought she had a plan.

3852
02:48:28,390 --> 02:48:31,910
Like, okay, I'm going to put the heads in and then if I'm by myself, I can do this.

3853
02:48:31,930 --> 02:48:33,650
I can't believe you trusted her.

3854
02:48:35,830 --> 02:48:36,150
Yeah.

3855
02:48:36,590 --> 02:48:38,530
I think she just wanted to get some water.

3856
02:48:49,110 --> 02:48:50,550
Yeah, never trust her.

3857
02:48:50,830 --> 02:48:52,050
Actually, I'm going to get some water too.

3858
02:48:52,110 --> 02:48:52,690
I'll be right back.

3859
02:48:53,510 --> 02:48:53,810
Yeah.

3860
02:48:53,910 --> 02:48:56,090
Okay, I will stretch.

3861
02:48:56,410 --> 02:48:57,470
Okay, everybody stretch.

3862
02:48:58,430 --> 02:49:01,290
Oh yeah, stretching is a good idea.

3863
02:49:08,790 --> 02:49:09,610
You're back already?

3864
02:49:12,940 --> 02:49:14,420
I thought you already came back.

3865
02:49:23,970 --> 02:49:27,170
Man, stretching is something that I gotta remember to do more often.

3866
02:49:29,170 --> 02:49:30,830
Yeah, that good old pause.

3867
02:49:30,950 --> 02:49:31,570
You're a chick.

3868
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:42,020
I heard that.

3869
02:49:44,640 --> 02:49:45,820
Oh, I don't think she can hear.

3870
02:49:50,080 --> 02:49:51,140
Thank you, chat.

3871
02:49:53,720 --> 02:49:54,680
Thank you.

3872
02:49:59,300 --> 02:50:00,600
Windows hanging out.

3873
02:50:04,050 --> 02:50:05,550
Oh wait, hold on.

3874
02:50:05,990 --> 02:50:07,350
I'm trying to get my back to crack.

3875
02:50:13,750 --> 02:50:14,990
I'm back, baby.

3876
02:50:16,230 --> 02:50:17,590
Welcome back.

3877
02:50:18,190 --> 02:50:18,870
Thanks.

3878
02:50:21,930 --> 02:50:23,290
Hell yeah.

3879
02:50:24,330 --> 02:50:25,710
Hello, I'm back.

3880
02:50:26,950 --> 02:50:28,090
What did I miss?

3881
02:50:31,030 --> 02:50:32,770
Welcome back, everybody.

3882
02:50:33,610 --> 02:50:34,190
Welcome back.

3883
02:50:34,670 --> 02:50:35,230
You, baby.

3884
02:50:35,250 --> 02:50:37,450
We're just stretching, getting some water.

3885
02:50:37,530 --> 02:50:38,790
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

3886
02:50:38,790 --> 02:50:40,910
You girls wanna play another?

3887
02:50:42,150 --> 02:50:47,790
I was saying I have... I have 40... 40 minutes.

3888
02:50:47,930 --> 02:50:49,410
I have 40 minutes that we can do another.

3889
02:50:49,490 --> 02:50:50,390
Oh, let's do just a few rounds.

3890
02:50:50,790 --> 02:50:51,770
40 minutes?

3891
02:50:52,350 --> 02:50:53,410
Yeah, 40 minutes.

3892
02:50:53,750 --> 02:50:55,010
Please, sir, I'd like more.

3893
02:50:55,230 --> 02:50:55,970
Please, sir.

3894
02:50:58,030 --> 02:50:59,030
Let's get it.

3895
02:50:59,050 --> 02:51:00,090
Let's get this bag.

3896
02:51:00,230 --> 02:51:00,550
Yeah!

3897
02:51:01,570 --> 02:51:04,690
Oh my god, Limes, your Twitch bots are spamming me today.

3898
02:51:05,850 --> 02:51:07,150
The Miami ones?

3899
02:51:09,210 --> 02:51:10,010
Miami bots?

3900
02:51:10,510 --> 02:51:12,090
I'm getting Miami bots.

3901
02:51:12,250 --> 02:51:14,130
You guys haven't heard of the Miami bots?

3902
02:51:14,230 --> 02:51:17,690
I don't know why, but I specifically have bots that come to my channel.

3903
02:51:18,110 --> 02:51:25,850
And they say... they, like, say something that's, like, tangentially related to the subject in the chat, but then start talking about Miami.

3904
02:51:26,090 --> 02:51:31,790
So, like, because I have a plushie out and people talk about the plush, they'll come in and be like, Hey, super cute plushie.

3905
02:51:31,850 --> 02:51:32,810
It's really cute.

3906
02:51:32,930 --> 02:51:38,670
Speaking of plushies, have you heard about the unique Manatee plushie that's out in Miami, Florida right now?

3907
02:51:39,010 --> 02:51:40,650
It's so fucking weird.

3908
02:51:40,810 --> 02:51:41,990
I don't know why they do it.

3909
02:51:44,050 --> 02:51:46,610
Limes, can you please stop viewbotting, okay?

3910
02:51:46,990 --> 02:51:48,010
Okay, my bad.

3911
02:51:49,070 --> 02:51:49,710
My bad.

3912
02:51:50,410 --> 02:51:51,050
Oh, look at mine.

3913
02:51:51,170 --> 02:51:51,430
Wait, wait, wait.

3914
02:51:52,550 --> 02:51:53,290
Yo, nice.

3915
02:51:53,430 --> 02:51:55,130
Sounds like some cool merch drops happening.

3916
02:51:55,270 --> 02:51:58,270
Speaking of new stuff, did you know Miami just got a new art installation downtown?

3917
02:51:58,270 --> 02:51:59,150
It's now.

3918
02:52:00,210 --> 02:52:02,390
I don't understand the Miami bots.

3919
02:52:02,590 --> 02:52:03,370
I inspected you.

3920
02:52:03,490 --> 02:52:03,890
I'm sorry.

3921
02:52:04,030 --> 02:52:05,230
You guys are gonna start getting it soon.

3922
02:52:05,310 --> 02:52:06,130
I should stop talking about them.

3923
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:08,050
They're a desperate for tourism, I guess.

3924
02:52:08,390 --> 02:52:10,450
What if it's actually Miami that did this?

3925
02:52:10,570 --> 02:52:13,590
What if Miami paid these bots to do this?

3926
02:52:13,890 --> 02:52:14,850
Who else would it be?

3927
02:52:15,050 --> 02:52:15,790
Who else would it be?

3928
02:52:18,610 --> 02:52:20,730
I'm really sorry if you get Miami bots.

3929
02:52:21,990 --> 02:52:22,830
Okay, wait, wait.

3930
02:52:23,030 --> 02:52:23,570
Yeah, keep going.

3931
02:52:23,710 --> 02:52:23,830
Wait.

3932
02:52:23,990 --> 02:52:24,270
I'm going.

3933
02:52:25,170 --> 02:52:25,850
No, no, no.

3934
02:52:25,850 --> 02:52:27,210
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

3935
02:52:27,210 --> 02:52:27,770
Yay!

3936
02:52:28,290 --> 02:52:28,770
Oh, oh.

3937
02:52:29,270 --> 02:52:30,750
Hold on, I have a very delicate voice.

3938
02:52:31,010 --> 02:52:31,750
Can I put that in here?

3939
02:52:32,390 --> 02:52:32,650
Yes.

3940
02:52:33,850 --> 02:52:35,890
Uh-oh, the music got creepy.

3941
02:52:36,690 --> 02:52:38,890
I think that might be a sting for something funny.

3942
02:52:40,150 --> 02:52:40,590
Yay!

3943
02:52:42,550 --> 02:52:44,090
Let me get this out of the way.

3944
02:52:44,110 --> 02:52:44,710
I'm eating popcorn.

3945
02:52:46,910 --> 02:52:47,770
You're eating popcorn?

3946
02:52:47,930 --> 02:52:49,290
I have sweet potato fries.

3947
02:52:49,790 --> 02:52:50,230
Yummy!

3948
02:52:50,930 --> 02:52:52,170
That's so good.

3949
02:52:52,370 --> 02:52:53,450
I love the potato fries.

3950
02:52:54,210 --> 02:52:55,450
I'm eating popcorn.

3951
02:52:55,890 --> 02:52:59,250
What kind of popcorn?

3952
02:53:02,350 --> 02:53:03,630
Cattle corn.

3953
02:53:04,050 --> 02:53:05,030
Wait, what kind of popcorn?

3954
02:53:05,670 --> 02:53:06,430
Cattle corn.

3955
02:53:06,970 --> 02:53:07,190
Careful.

3956
02:53:07,610 --> 02:53:08,230
Oh, yummy.

3957
02:53:08,770 --> 02:53:12,910
Nothing up here.

3958
02:53:15,450 --> 02:53:16,730
Up here.

3959
02:53:17,870 --> 02:53:18,410
Here, mom.

3960
02:53:18,530 --> 02:53:18,850
I'll bring it.

3961
02:53:23,810 --> 02:53:25,290
Why is the music so creepy?

3962
02:53:25,630 --> 02:53:26,290
Oh, there's a monkey.

3963
02:53:26,890 --> 02:53:27,330
Because...

3964
02:53:27,870 --> 02:53:28,730
You're my monkey.

3965
02:53:30,730 --> 02:53:31,630
Hello, monkey.

3966
02:53:32,070 --> 02:53:32,170
Hello.

3967
02:53:32,870 --> 02:53:34,670
Literally the monster into the bed.

3968
02:53:34,790 --> 02:53:34,870
What?

3969
02:53:39,850 --> 02:53:40,530
That's crazy.

3970
02:53:43,330 --> 02:53:44,470
How do you know it's a man?

3971
02:53:48,050 --> 02:53:49,150
Oh, yeah, you're right.

3972
02:53:49,250 --> 02:53:49,590
My bad.

3973
02:53:49,810 --> 02:53:50,210
My bad.

3974
02:53:50,430 --> 02:53:50,890
I misheard.

3975
02:53:50,890 --> 02:53:54,910
I heard grandpa's wife.

3976
02:53:57,830 --> 02:54:00,030
Laser clown, laser clown time.

3977
02:54:00,450 --> 02:54:01,150
Nope, nope, nope.

3978
02:54:02,170 --> 02:54:03,170
No way, again?

3979
02:54:05,570 --> 02:54:06,390
Okay, hide.

3980
02:54:09,190 --> 02:54:10,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3981
02:54:10,790 --> 02:54:11,950
Do not aggro and then later...

3982
02:54:13,250 --> 02:54:14,550
I'll move the cart out instantly.

3983
02:54:14,730 --> 02:54:16,170
No, no, no, no, no, please.

3984
02:54:16,590 --> 02:54:17,830
No, sir, please.

3985
02:54:19,510 --> 02:54:20,170
I beg you.

3986
02:54:22,470 --> 02:54:23,050
Grandpa's wife.

3987
02:54:23,050 --> 02:54:24,030
Don't get too close to his feet.

3988
02:54:24,310 --> 02:54:25,750
Are you fucking kidding me?

3989
02:54:26,410 --> 02:54:27,650
I'm gonna aggro my way.

3990
02:54:28,110 --> 02:54:29,090
I'm gonna aggro my way.

3991
02:54:29,410 --> 02:54:30,430
I'm gonna aggro my way.

3992
02:54:30,510 --> 02:54:31,330
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move.

3993
02:54:32,250 --> 02:54:33,730
He got everything.

3994
02:54:35,970 --> 02:54:36,370
Everything?

3995
02:54:37,830 --> 02:54:38,630
Almost everything.

3996
02:54:39,050 --> 02:54:40,230
He's back, he's back, he's back.

3997
02:54:40,230 --> 02:54:41,110
No, no, no, he's back, he's back.

3998
02:54:41,130 --> 02:54:42,650
I'm gonna try to get him to shoot me.

3999
02:54:47,220 --> 02:54:48,860
There's gnomes, there's gnomes.

4000
02:54:48,900 --> 02:54:49,600
Oh, shit.

4001
02:54:49,740 --> 02:54:49,920
Okay.

4002
02:54:50,340 --> 02:54:50,940
Oh, wait.

4003
02:54:50,940 --> 02:54:51,620
I can't believe.

4004
02:55:02,130 --> 02:55:04,730
I'm gonna disguise myself right here.

4005
02:55:07,730 --> 02:55:09,090
I'll leave him there for now.

4006
02:55:10,270 --> 02:55:11,690
Why is the clown so hard?

4007
02:55:14,470 --> 02:55:15,950
You've been gnomed.

4008
02:55:17,350 --> 02:55:18,450
Let's just keep going.

4009
02:55:25,400 --> 02:55:27,300
Such a scary place.

4010
02:55:27,300 --> 02:55:30,220
Oh, I thought that was a thing.

4011
02:55:30,760 --> 02:55:30,920
No?

4012
02:55:36,840 --> 02:55:38,180
They're putting in money, baby.

4013
02:55:38,420 --> 02:55:42,120
Oh, this is heavy and expensive.

4014
02:55:44,100 --> 02:55:45,580
I should not touch it.

4015
02:55:49,180 --> 02:55:50,700
I shouldn't touch it.

4016
02:55:51,020 --> 02:55:51,720
I need help.

4017
02:55:55,100 --> 02:55:56,860
Is he camping in here or something?

4018
02:56:01,710 --> 02:56:03,650
Maybe he'll like it because it's his brethren.

4019
02:56:06,530 --> 02:56:06,970
Clown?

4020
02:56:09,690 --> 02:56:10,930
Ew, that painting's scary.

4021
02:56:12,810 --> 02:56:13,690
No touchy.

4022
02:56:17,290 --> 02:56:18,750
I don't... Actually, I got lost.

4023
02:56:19,770 --> 02:56:21,830
He scared me so much, I lost directions.

4024
02:56:22,750 --> 02:56:22,930
Oops.

4025
02:56:27,280 --> 02:56:28,900
Oh, I need to go down that hallway.

4026
02:56:38,340 --> 02:56:39,160
Oh, hi.

4027
02:56:39,360 --> 02:56:39,560
Hey.

4028
02:56:40,240 --> 02:56:41,060
There's a...

4029
02:56:41,060 --> 02:56:42,020
Is it going good?

4030
02:56:42,260 --> 02:56:43,480
Oh, the clown went down that way.

4031
02:56:44,520 --> 02:56:44,920
Okay.

4032
02:56:45,400 --> 02:56:46,780
We kind of need the cart.

4033
02:56:47,560 --> 02:56:49,380
Where is... I don't know where anybody is.

4034
02:56:50,520 --> 02:56:53,220
I'm hoping they went off in that direction with the cart.

4035
02:56:53,900 --> 02:56:54,300
Oh, sorry.

4036
02:56:54,580 --> 02:56:55,200
Oh, shit, sorry.

4037
02:56:55,700 --> 02:56:58,420
I'm going to go bring one item back, but everything over there is really delicate.

4038
02:56:59,480 --> 02:57:01,980
Yeah, I saw an expensive box.

4039
02:57:08,950 --> 02:57:11,970
I was trying to hopefully find the other extraction point.

4040
02:57:13,470 --> 02:57:15,230
There isn't one on this one because it's the first map.

4041
02:57:15,230 --> 02:57:15,910
Oh, you're right.

4042
02:57:16,070 --> 02:57:17,010
There's only just one.

4043
02:57:17,930 --> 02:57:18,330
Yeah.

4044
02:57:19,630 --> 02:57:21,030
The box.

4045
02:57:21,750 --> 02:57:22,990
Oh my gosh.

4046
02:57:23,830 --> 02:57:26,730
I'm going to make this clown worthless at this rate.

4047
02:57:27,250 --> 02:57:29,340
Oh no, speaking of...

4048
02:57:30,490 --> 02:57:30,890
Okay.

4049
02:57:38,380 --> 02:57:38,720
You okay?

4050
02:57:39,200 --> 02:57:39,440
Yep.

4051
02:57:40,480 --> 02:57:41,060
Okay.

4052
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:43,780
Yeah, I can't... He's leaving.

4053
02:57:44,460 --> 02:57:44,880
Nevermind.

4054
02:57:45,980 --> 02:57:47,140
He's being a real dick.

4055
02:57:50,640 --> 02:57:51,820
He left?

4056
02:57:57,040 --> 02:57:57,720
I'm okay.

4057
02:57:57,840 --> 02:57:58,440
Let's go.

4058
02:57:58,860 --> 02:57:59,160
Gnomes!

4059
02:58:00,740 --> 02:58:01,180
Fuckers.

4060
02:58:03,880 --> 02:58:05,120
The clown's following us.

4061
02:58:05,140 --> 02:58:05,560
Be careful.

4062
02:58:07,820 --> 02:58:09,740
Yeah, we're getting really, really unlucky.

4063
02:58:10,060 --> 02:58:10,260
Yeah.

4064
02:58:11,340 --> 02:58:13,280
Mint, you have... Oh, gnomes, gnomes, gnomes.

4065
02:58:13,320 --> 02:58:14,000
Try to break... Yeah.

4066
02:58:14,900 --> 02:58:15,440
Break him.

4067
02:58:16,120 --> 02:58:16,780
Break his ass.

4068
02:58:17,580 --> 02:58:17,860
Yeah.

4069
02:58:20,100 --> 02:58:21,900
What do you guys think we should do?

4070
02:58:22,660 --> 02:58:22,960
Die?

4071
02:58:23,160 --> 02:58:23,960
I mean, there's still loot.

4072
02:58:24,160 --> 02:58:25,280
We just need to go grab it.

4073
02:58:25,280 --> 02:58:25,560
There's a lot.

4074
02:58:25,660 --> 02:58:27,080
I can juke the clown.

4075
02:58:27,620 --> 02:58:28,740
She died, I think.

4076
02:58:28,960 --> 02:58:29,780
Yeah, she died.

4077
02:58:29,800 --> 02:58:29,880
Oh, I see her head.

4078
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:30,500
I see her head.

4079
02:58:30,740 --> 02:58:30,920
Ow.

4080
02:58:33,240 --> 02:58:33,820
Come here.

4081
02:58:34,220 --> 02:58:34,900
What are you doing to me?

4082
02:58:36,280 --> 02:58:38,240
I'm putting you in the cart like a baby.

4083
02:58:43,320 --> 02:58:44,580
Come on, baby.

4084
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:45,820
Come on, Minto.

4085
02:58:46,240 --> 02:58:47,120
Come here.

4086
02:58:48,120 --> 02:58:49,460
I got you a crown, Mint.

4087
02:58:49,920 --> 02:58:51,080
My little dumb baby.

4088
02:58:51,840 --> 02:58:54,180
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

4089
02:58:57,800 --> 02:58:58,540
Shut up.

4090
02:58:58,620 --> 02:58:59,460
Shut the fuck up.

4091
02:58:59,700 --> 02:59:00,960
Shut the fuck up.

4092
02:59:03,700 --> 02:59:05,160
Oh, I think I'm doomed.

4093
02:59:08,220 --> 02:59:09,780
Did you get me, stupid baby?

4094
02:59:10,520 --> 02:59:11,940
Did you deserve me, stupid baby?

4095
02:59:12,020 --> 02:59:12,760
I'm stuck.

4096
02:59:13,540 --> 02:59:15,140
I told you to shut up.

4097
02:59:15,380 --> 02:59:16,960
I told you to shut up.

4098
02:59:17,100 --> 02:59:17,900
It's fine, he left.

4099
02:59:21,540 --> 02:59:22,020
Ouch.

4100
02:59:28,680 --> 02:59:29,920
It's fine, he left.

4101
02:59:30,020 --> 02:59:31,480
Meanwhile, he comes back around the corner.

4102
02:59:34,220 --> 02:59:35,780
That was so funny.

4103
02:59:36,720 --> 02:59:37,380
He got me too.

4104
02:59:37,640 --> 02:59:38,240
I'm not strong anymore.

4105
02:59:38,420 --> 02:59:38,920
This sucks.

4106
02:59:39,140 --> 02:59:39,500
No get.

4107
02:59:39,700 --> 02:59:40,000
No get.

4108
02:59:42,140 --> 02:59:43,100
What happened?

4109
02:59:45,760 --> 02:59:51,480
Mint, it has been so unlucky to get the clown on the first every...

4110
02:59:51,480 --> 02:59:52,740
Like, it has been so unlucky.

4111
02:59:52,940 --> 02:59:53,680
You are bad luck.

4112
02:59:54,260 --> 02:59:54,980
I'm bad luck now.

4113
02:59:54,980 --> 02:59:55,300
Hey.

4114
02:59:55,720 --> 02:59:56,020
Sorry.

4115
02:59:56,460 --> 02:59:58,800
We got super far the last time, alright?

4116
02:59:58,860 --> 02:59:59,400
We really did.

4117
02:59:59,620 --> 03:00:00,740
We passed the clown the first time.

4118
03:00:00,740 --> 03:00:04,520
Honestly, with four players, we're doing so good.

4119
03:00:04,760 --> 03:00:06,300
Look at Limelight doing it all by herself.

4120
03:00:07,440 --> 03:00:10,040
No, I'm telling you, so many lobbies...

4121
03:00:10,040 --> 03:00:13,000
Her and Giga, you can trust them to...

4122
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:13,380
Oh my gosh.

4123
03:00:13,400 --> 03:00:13,660
Me?

4124
03:00:14,240 --> 03:00:16,700
When I'm alone, I'm like, alright guys, watch me kill myself.

4125
03:00:17,820 --> 03:00:19,520
Just leave it to the pro gamers.

4126
03:00:23,320 --> 03:00:26,160
I feel like there shouldn't be two enemies on one map.

4127
03:00:26,280 --> 03:00:27,380
Especially if you get the clown.

4128
03:00:27,680 --> 03:00:28,720
Or on the first map, I mean.

4129
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:31,400
We just got really bad RNG.

4130
03:00:31,800 --> 03:00:32,180
Yeah.

4131
03:00:32,940 --> 03:00:34,380
You think we'll have enough?

4132
03:00:35,840 --> 03:00:37,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4133
03:00:37,800 --> 03:00:38,620
Let's find out.

4134
03:00:40,220 --> 03:00:42,460
I don't know if she knows that you guys are...

4135
03:00:42,460 --> 03:00:43,520
Oh no, she found me.

4136
03:00:43,580 --> 03:00:43,740
Nevermind.

4137
03:00:44,360 --> 03:00:45,140
She found us.

4138
03:00:46,740 --> 03:00:48,200
Yay, she loves me more.

4139
03:00:48,320 --> 03:00:49,260
She found me first.

4140
03:00:49,360 --> 03:00:51,540
I don't think she found... I don't think she's gonna find me.

4141
03:00:52,460 --> 03:00:53,380
No, she will, she will.

4142
03:00:53,980 --> 03:00:54,780
She can see you in the cart.

4143
03:00:55,520 --> 03:00:56,920
Oh, and there's stuff in the cart.

4144
03:00:56,940 --> 03:00:57,380
That's right.

4145
03:00:58,220 --> 03:00:59,020
No, no, no.

4146
03:00:59,580 --> 03:01:00,840
No, there's the crown too.

4147
03:01:02,220 --> 03:01:03,680
Oh, that's my girl.

4148
03:01:04,480 --> 03:01:05,300
She's so good.

4149
03:01:06,060 --> 03:01:07,740
She's my favorite small green woman.

4150
03:01:10,600 --> 03:01:11,320
I know.

4151
03:01:11,720 --> 03:01:12,100
It's okay.

4152
03:01:16,220 --> 03:01:17,920
Mint, you make it very hard to love you, okay?

4153
03:01:18,300 --> 03:01:18,660
I know.

4154
03:01:19,040 --> 03:01:19,660
You the same.

4155
03:01:20,620 --> 03:01:21,280
Yeah, I know.

4156
03:01:21,500 --> 03:01:22,160
I do it on purpose.

4157
03:01:22,480 --> 03:01:24,220
I see the color pink now and I throw up.

4158
03:01:25,460 --> 03:01:27,700
I feel like I'm in the middle of a lover's quarrel.

4159
03:01:27,700 --> 03:01:28,400
It's not a lover.

4160
03:01:28,520 --> 03:01:29,220
No, no, no.

4161
03:01:29,280 --> 03:01:29,840
A lover, no.

4162
03:01:31,320 --> 03:01:33,160
Yeah, my stinky girlfriend and I.

4163
03:01:33,920 --> 03:01:35,840
Oh my gosh, she still needs a little bit more.

4164
03:01:36,100 --> 03:01:37,840
Oh, she just barely didn't make it.

4165
03:01:40,200 --> 03:01:42,700
It would be so funny if she self-destructed.

4166
03:01:44,440 --> 03:01:45,400
It might actually.

4167
03:01:45,400 --> 03:01:46,680
It'd be funny if the clown got her.

4168
03:01:48,500 --> 03:01:49,520
Look at her, she's destroying these things.

4169
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:50,520
Or like a new mob.

4170
03:01:51,260 --> 03:01:51,780
She is.

4171
03:01:53,240 --> 03:01:57,380
Yeah, it is a lover's quarrel, but luckily we make up all the time.

4172
03:01:57,700 --> 03:01:58,600
She got a fat stack.

4173
03:01:58,600 --> 03:01:59,340
She did it.

4174
03:02:00,420 --> 03:02:00,960
She did it.

4175
03:02:01,540 --> 03:02:04,060
Oh my God, can we have five gifted for Limealicious please?

4176
03:02:06,440 --> 03:02:08,820
I can't believe she brought the Miami spam bots.

4177
03:02:09,600 --> 03:02:10,360
That's so funny.

4178
03:02:13,540 --> 03:02:15,020
We're coming back!

4179
03:02:18,280 --> 03:02:20,500
3, 2, 1.

4180
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:22,040
Happy New Year!

4181
03:02:28,240 --> 03:02:31,980
Yo, you soloed that like crazy.

4182
03:02:32,640 --> 03:02:34,900
She's the best.

4183
03:02:35,720 --> 03:02:37,020
I couldn't let you down.

4184
03:02:40,180 --> 03:02:40,860
Gnomes!

4185
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:43,500
Oh my God, we almost got gnomed.

4186
03:02:44,640 --> 03:02:45,920
Last minute gnoming.

4187
03:02:47,500 --> 03:02:49,140
You got gnomed!

4188
03:02:50,960 --> 03:02:52,720
You've been gnomed.

4189
03:02:58,340 --> 03:03:00,420
We can do a strength and a stamina.

4190
03:03:02,640 --> 03:03:04,120
Give Lime a move back for strength.

4191
03:03:06,640 --> 03:03:07,420
There's a gun.

4192
03:03:07,620 --> 03:03:08,880
Oh, we don't have enough money though.

4193
03:03:09,660 --> 03:03:13,740
No, that's so shady of the game to give us a gun early on when we can't afford it.

4194
03:03:13,880 --> 03:03:14,320
I know, right?

4195
03:03:14,960 --> 03:03:16,540
I think that's a tranq one though, right?

4196
03:03:16,640 --> 03:03:18,140
Oh my God, there's someone sitting in this seat.

4197
03:03:18,560 --> 03:03:19,280
That's crazy.

4198
03:03:21,620 --> 03:03:22,020
Ash, catch him.

4199
03:03:23,620 --> 03:03:24,520
Ash, catch him.

4200
03:03:26,780 --> 03:03:28,980
Actually, we have enough for more stamina for everybody.

4201
03:03:29,260 --> 03:03:30,680
I love your little crown, sweetheart.

4202
03:03:30,820 --> 03:03:31,140
It's so good.

4203
03:03:31,140 --> 03:03:32,040
That's it, that's it.

4204
03:03:32,040 --> 03:03:32,960
It's so good on you.

4205
03:03:33,260 --> 03:03:34,260
Sorry, I was misreading.

4206
03:03:36,200 --> 03:03:37,460
You've got to stay on.

4207
03:03:37,600 --> 03:03:38,100
I know.

4208
03:03:41,420 --> 03:03:42,500
Oh, water closet.

4209
03:03:42,660 --> 03:03:43,420
Wait, I can go in here?

4210
03:03:52,560 --> 03:03:53,680
Sorry, I'm coming.

4211
03:03:55,780 --> 03:03:57,260
Come on, to the boat.

4212
03:03:57,500 --> 03:03:58,180
I'm coming, I'm coming.

4213
03:04:00,720 --> 03:04:01,440
I'm out of stamina.

4214
03:04:01,860 --> 03:04:02,820
I had to go potty real quick.

4215
03:04:02,880 --> 03:04:03,960
Go, go, go.

4216
03:04:05,140 --> 03:04:06,260
Yeah, yeah.

4217
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:12,040
I like how your dumb character is just looking with their dumb little eyes.

4218
03:04:13,340 --> 03:04:15,820
And so you're so pretty in her crown.

4219
03:04:15,960 --> 03:04:16,560
My queen.

4220
03:04:16,880 --> 03:04:17,500
My queen.

4221
03:04:17,800 --> 03:04:18,920
Oh, my queen.

4222
03:04:19,220 --> 03:04:19,680
My queen.

4223
03:04:20,120 --> 03:04:20,620
My queen.

4224
03:04:20,880 --> 03:04:21,400
My queen.

4225
03:04:21,640 --> 03:04:22,200
My queen.

4226
03:04:22,640 --> 03:04:23,200
My queen.

4227
03:04:23,480 --> 03:04:23,900
My queen.

4228
03:04:23,960 --> 03:04:24,620
My queen.

4229
03:04:24,920 --> 03:04:25,060
My queen.

4230
03:04:25,980 --> 03:04:26,520
My queen.

4231
03:04:26,920 --> 03:04:27,480
My queen.

4232
03:04:27,820 --> 03:04:28,020
My queen.

4233
03:04:28,140 --> 03:04:28,940
My queen.

4234
03:04:29,080 --> 03:04:29,440
My queen.

4235
03:04:29,520 --> 03:04:30,040
My queen.

4236
03:04:30,040 --> 03:04:30,280
My queen.

4237
03:04:30,480 --> 03:04:31,500
My queen.

4238
03:04:31,700 --> 03:04:32,480
My queen.

4239
03:04:33,200 --> 03:04:34,880
What's going on in here?

4240
03:04:34,900 --> 03:04:35,400
My queen.

4241
03:04:35,680 --> 03:04:35,980
My queen.

4242
03:04:36,620 --> 03:04:37,040
My queen.

4243
03:04:37,040 --> 03:04:37,580
My queen.

4244
03:04:37,720 --> 03:04:39,340
Do you want me to start the ship?

4245
03:04:39,860 --> 03:04:40,240
Yeah.

4246
03:04:40,680 --> 03:04:41,220
Okay.

4247
03:04:41,720 --> 03:04:43,660
It sounds like we're saying Michael Ween.

4248
03:04:44,080 --> 03:04:44,640
Yes.

4249
03:04:44,860 --> 03:04:45,180
Okay.

4250
03:04:45,640 --> 03:04:46,400
Yes, thank you.

4251
03:04:46,500 --> 03:04:47,500
Have a nice day.

4252
03:04:50,680 --> 03:04:51,700
My key.

4253
03:04:53,680 --> 03:04:54,240
Nice.

4254
03:04:54,380 --> 03:04:55,460
Oh, hell yeah.

4255
03:04:55,760 --> 03:04:56,880
One of you get the stamina.

4256
03:04:56,880 --> 03:04:57,240
Staminaur.

4257
03:04:59,480 --> 03:04:59,960
Staminaur.

4258
03:05:00,980 --> 03:05:02,760
Cinder should have it because she's our queen.

4259
03:05:05,020 --> 03:05:06,340
All hail Queen Cinder.

4260
03:05:06,860 --> 03:05:08,220
All hail Queen Cinder.

4261
03:05:08,840 --> 03:05:09,800
I'm running around the house.

4262
03:05:11,180 --> 03:05:12,040
My queen.

4263
03:05:15,440 --> 03:05:18,060
Someone said, do you remember the time the queen visited Miami?

4264
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:23,140
Oh, God, no.

4265
03:05:24,240 --> 03:05:25,480
Yeah, I don't need a health kit.

4266
03:05:25,520 --> 03:05:25,800
It's fine.

4267
03:05:27,160 --> 03:05:29,260
Can't tell if you're bot or not.

4268
03:05:32,080 --> 03:05:33,080
Wait, what the hell?

4269
03:05:34,540 --> 03:05:35,420
Oh, sorry.

4270
03:05:35,600 --> 03:05:36,760
I just went a little too crazy.

4271
03:05:37,420 --> 03:05:38,440
You are crazy.

4272
03:05:41,140 --> 03:05:42,020
Items galore.

4273
03:05:43,060 --> 03:05:43,500
Bonsai.

4274
03:05:43,980 --> 03:05:44,420
Bonsai.

4275
03:05:44,940 --> 03:05:45,380
Chainsaw.

4276
03:05:47,020 --> 03:05:47,460
Konnichiwa.

4277
03:05:47,800 --> 03:05:48,580
This is my bonsai plant.

4278
03:05:53,080 --> 03:05:54,720
Oh wait, there's two now here.

4279
03:05:55,340 --> 03:05:56,220
There we go.

4280
03:05:56,220 --> 03:05:57,400
Where's the cart?

4281
03:05:59,020 --> 03:06:00,160
Sorry, apologies.

4282
03:06:00,900 --> 03:06:01,820
There we go.

4283
03:06:02,760 --> 03:06:03,940
We're just putting it in here?

4284
03:06:04,260 --> 03:06:04,460
Ok.

4285
03:06:04,900 --> 03:06:06,040
Yeah, just for safety.

4286
03:06:06,640 --> 03:06:07,460
That one...

4287
03:06:07,460 --> 03:06:09,000
Ok, we can't put anything else on for now.

4288
03:06:09,180 --> 03:06:09,660
But that's good.

4289
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:11,520
Hello.

4290
03:06:12,320 --> 03:06:13,440
Nice crown, queen.

4291
03:06:13,720 --> 03:06:15,880
Every queen needs a princess.

4292
03:06:22,100 --> 03:06:24,020
It's because I'm a little transparent.

4293
03:06:24,180 --> 03:06:24,900
That's fine.

4294
03:06:27,400 --> 03:06:27,800
Yay.

4295
03:06:30,320 --> 03:06:30,920
Oh, ducky.

4296
03:06:31,140 --> 03:06:31,860
Oh, ducky.

4297
03:06:32,280 --> 03:06:32,960
Careful with the duck.

4298
03:06:33,120 --> 03:06:34,180
It's ok, it's ok.

4299
03:06:34,240 --> 03:06:35,620
Just don't touch him and you'll be alright.

4300
03:06:37,240 --> 03:06:38,580
Can we sell him?

4301
03:06:38,880 --> 03:06:40,740
I can bring it back, hold on.

4302
03:06:41,340 --> 03:06:43,780
Oh, we got a frog situation.

4303
03:06:44,420 --> 03:06:45,680
Yeah, if you have a chainsaw.

4304
03:06:49,980 --> 03:06:51,660
Oh my god, you heard the duck.

4305
03:06:52,820 --> 03:06:54,900
You need to warn me if the duck is coming though.

4306
03:06:54,900 --> 03:06:56,600
Because he'll deliberately run into the chainsaw.

4307
03:06:56,720 --> 03:06:57,480
I don't know where the duck is.

4308
03:06:57,500 --> 03:06:58,100
Oh shit, really?

4309
03:07:01,560 --> 03:07:03,160
Oh, I think he ran into the duck.

4310
03:07:03,540 --> 03:07:04,560
I can hear it.

4311
03:07:05,840 --> 03:07:06,900
Who pissed it off?

4312
03:07:07,380 --> 03:07:08,860
The frog pissed it off.

4313
03:07:08,900 --> 03:07:09,060
The frog did.

4314
03:07:09,340 --> 03:07:09,580
Yeah.

4315
03:07:15,920 --> 03:07:16,720
How curious.

4316
03:07:17,060 --> 03:07:18,300
Maybe I killed the frog.

4317
03:07:22,070 --> 03:07:23,370
Can we kill the duck?

4318
03:07:23,870 --> 03:07:23,970
Duck versus frog.

4319
03:07:24,790 --> 03:07:25,850
I want the...

4320
03:07:25,850 --> 03:07:26,450
Kill the beast.

4321
03:07:26,890 --> 03:07:27,970
Kill the beast.

4322
03:07:29,270 --> 03:07:30,310
Oh no!

4323
03:07:31,890 --> 03:07:34,430
Are you Beauty and the Beast-ing right now?

4324
03:07:34,530 --> 03:07:35,430
A little bit, yeah.

4325
03:07:35,950 --> 03:07:37,110
Don't think I didn't hear that.

4326
03:07:37,210 --> 03:07:37,630
The frog is back, the frog is back.

4327
03:07:38,350 --> 03:07:38,590
Ok.

4328
03:07:39,430 --> 03:07:41,370
I'll get the saw, I'll get the saw.

4329
03:07:44,210 --> 03:07:44,730
Ok.

4330
03:07:45,510 --> 03:07:48,170
I'm confident in your abilities to operate heavy machinery, Mint.

4331
03:07:48,390 --> 03:07:49,850
I have a license.

4332
03:07:50,810 --> 03:07:51,330
Ok.

4333
03:07:51,930 --> 03:07:53,370
A driver's license.

4334
03:07:55,130 --> 03:07:56,610
I don't even have one of those.

4335
03:07:56,790 --> 03:07:58,330
So you're probably more qualified than me.

4336
03:07:59,230 --> 03:08:02,530
Move it out further in front of you if you can, so you're not in risk range.

4337
03:08:04,590 --> 03:08:05,710
Oh, there's two frogs!

4338
03:08:05,850 --> 03:08:06,870
There's three frogs!

4339
03:08:06,950 --> 03:08:07,510
There's three frogs!

4340
03:08:07,510 --> 03:08:08,450
There's three frogs!

4341
03:08:08,830 --> 03:08:09,970
The duck just took damage.

4342
03:08:14,590 --> 03:08:16,050
This place sucks.

4343
03:08:17,250 --> 03:08:19,090
Why are there three frogs?

4344
03:08:19,750 --> 03:08:20,910
I don't know.

4345
03:08:20,910 --> 03:08:24,090
Hopefully they piss the duck off and they all kill each other.

4346
03:08:28,610 --> 03:08:33,070
Mint, you have no idea how unlucky it is to have three frogs and a duck.

4347
03:08:33,290 --> 03:08:35,190
I've never seen this unluckiness.

4348
03:08:36,370 --> 03:08:37,230
It's you.

4349
03:08:37,470 --> 03:08:37,830
It's me!

4350
03:08:37,830 --> 03:08:38,650
You're the first one.

4351
03:08:38,850 --> 03:08:39,290
I am.

4352
03:08:39,350 --> 03:08:40,190
I know I am.

4353
03:08:41,550 --> 03:08:43,950
Tell your mom to please bring the sand back.

4354
03:08:44,430 --> 03:08:45,590
She threw it away.

4355
03:08:48,090 --> 03:08:49,170
Your stupid mother.

4356
03:08:50,410 --> 03:08:52,750
Did the frogs murder Mint?

4357
03:08:52,970 --> 03:08:53,610
Oh no.

4358
03:08:56,650 --> 03:08:57,490
How's your grandma?

4359
03:08:58,830 --> 03:08:59,490
My what?

4360
03:09:00,390 --> 03:09:01,510
I guess I should bring the carpet.

4361
03:09:01,790 --> 03:09:02,370
Oh, she died.

4362
03:09:02,510 --> 03:09:02,910
You didn't hear?

4363
03:09:03,370 --> 03:09:04,470
Shut up.

4364
03:09:04,550 --> 03:09:05,190
I don't believe you.

4365
03:09:05,530 --> 03:09:06,370
No, I'm serious.

4366
03:09:06,790 --> 03:09:07,550
My grandma died.

4367
03:09:07,770 --> 03:09:08,390
No, wait.

4368
03:09:10,030 --> 03:09:10,990
After Thanksgiving?

4369
03:09:11,250 --> 03:09:12,030
After I visited?

4370
03:09:12,670 --> 03:09:14,230
Are you kidding me, Mint?

4371
03:09:14,370 --> 03:09:16,110
She died like two weeks ago.

4372
03:09:16,850 --> 03:09:19,070
What the fuck, Mint?

4373
03:09:20,210 --> 03:09:22,930
You just dropped a bomb on me like that.

4374
03:09:27,830 --> 03:09:29,870
Mint, I'm going to cry.

4375
03:09:30,570 --> 03:09:31,590
I'm actually going to cry.

4376
03:09:31,850 --> 03:09:33,190
It's my grandma.

4377
03:09:33,430 --> 03:09:34,690
Why are you crying over mine?

4378
03:09:35,110 --> 03:09:37,050
She invited me for Christmas.

4379
03:09:38,670 --> 03:09:41,270
She invited me for next year's cake.

4380
03:09:41,270 --> 03:09:42,750
I guess you just gave them time to leave.

4381
03:09:46,810 --> 03:09:48,490
She invited me.

4382
03:09:49,990 --> 03:09:51,150
Stop laughing.

4383
03:09:51,910 --> 03:09:53,570
I have tears in my eyes.

4384
03:09:56,990 --> 03:09:59,550
Mint, what the fuck?

4385
03:10:01,840 --> 03:10:07,110
I was like joking that we have to go see your grandmother for Thanksgiving before she dies, but...

4386
03:10:07,650 --> 03:10:09,330
You brought this up and now I'm scared.

4387
03:10:09,650 --> 03:10:10,910
Did I just blow you out of the window?

4388
03:10:13,790 --> 03:10:14,950
My condolences.

4389
03:10:16,590 --> 03:10:17,890
She's too cool.

4390
03:10:18,070 --> 03:10:24,650
She seemed like, again, like, obviously, you know, she's old, but she like had her wits somewhat about her.

4391
03:10:24,910 --> 03:10:27,730
Yeah, the brain tumor came back.

4392
03:10:28,750 --> 03:10:29,670
But she, it was fine.

4393
03:10:29,770 --> 03:10:31,990
She died in her sleep and it was peaceful.

4394
03:10:32,690 --> 03:10:35,470
Mint, I didn't even give her a kiss when she asked for one.

4395
03:10:35,990 --> 03:10:37,310
Oh, you said you were sick.

4396
03:10:38,330 --> 03:10:39,130
I was.

4397
03:10:39,470 --> 03:10:40,730
Just a little bit more.

4398
03:10:41,170 --> 03:10:43,370
Fuck, she asked me for a kiss and I said no.

4399
03:10:43,870 --> 03:10:44,590
Yes, that's fine.

4400
03:10:45,710 --> 03:10:47,250
Oh yeah, we're so done.

4401
03:10:47,250 --> 03:10:48,170
You'll see her in hell.

4402
03:10:49,170 --> 03:10:50,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4403
03:10:50,470 --> 03:10:53,170
I mean, obviously, all jokes aside, my condolences.

4404
03:10:53,410 --> 03:10:55,430
I had no idea or I wouldn't have asked.

4405
03:10:56,110 --> 03:10:56,930
I know.

4406
03:10:57,570 --> 03:10:58,810
It's so funny.

4407
03:10:59,710 --> 03:11:01,410
I should have just been like, oh yeah, she's fine.

4408
03:11:03,990 --> 03:11:07,490
I had no idea, fuck.

4409
03:11:09,130 --> 03:11:10,510
Oh my god.

4410
03:11:11,590 --> 03:11:16,790
People kept saying and he kept saying grandma's ashes, but everybody keeps calling them grandma's ashes in the game.

4411
03:11:18,270 --> 03:11:20,190
It's just a very normal thing to say.

4412
03:11:20,550 --> 03:11:21,090
I know.

4413
03:11:21,410 --> 03:11:22,570
I didn't think it was anything.

4414
03:11:25,130 --> 03:11:26,670
Here we go!

4415
03:11:32,150 --> 03:11:34,330
I am traumatized.

4416
03:11:39,530 --> 03:11:40,870
I need a minute.

4417
03:11:41,110 --> 03:11:42,050
I'm so sorry.

4418
03:11:42,130 --> 03:11:42,390
No.

4419
03:11:44,670 --> 03:11:46,670
Do you want to tell them?

4420
03:11:47,250 --> 03:11:49,450
I mean, I'm listening.

4421
03:11:50,170 --> 03:11:54,910
I went to Thanksgiving dinner at Min's house and I was like, so by the way, how's it been?

4422
03:11:55,010 --> 03:11:55,690
How's your grandma?

4423
03:11:56,110 --> 03:11:58,850
But she's like, well, she died two weeks ago.

4424
03:11:59,330 --> 03:12:01,550
And I was like, no, for real.

4425
03:12:04,510 --> 03:12:07,010
Guys, I'm still traumatized.

4426
03:12:07,030 --> 03:12:09,790
I can't believe this is happening in this fucking game.

4427
03:12:10,110 --> 03:12:12,390
Like you as a little robot being like...

4428
03:12:12,390 --> 03:12:13,370
It's okay, Mata.

4429
03:12:13,750 --> 03:12:18,230
I ended up, I had breakfast with my family and my great grandmother was there.

4430
03:12:18,490 --> 03:12:20,530
And she's like, when are you getting married?

4431
03:12:20,730 --> 03:12:22,770
And I'm like, I don't know.

4432
03:12:22,970 --> 03:12:26,050
But I was making a joke and I said, don't worry, you'll be invited.

4433
03:12:26,250 --> 03:12:28,250
And she says, I want to be alive.

4434
03:12:28,790 --> 03:12:29,150
No!

4435
03:12:34,570 --> 03:12:35,290
Oh no.

4436
03:12:35,690 --> 03:12:37,250
I am experiencing loss.

4437
03:12:38,090 --> 03:12:38,450
Loss?

4438
03:12:38,610 --> 03:12:39,730
It's my grandma!

4439
03:12:40,510 --> 03:12:41,350
She invited me.

4440
03:12:41,430 --> 03:12:47,070
She asked me for a kiss and I said no because I was getting a little sick and I didn't want her to get sick.

4441
03:12:47,990 --> 03:12:51,310
I was giving everybody kisses and she was like, would I get a kiss?

4442
03:12:51,350 --> 03:12:52,050
And I said no.

4443
03:12:52,230 --> 03:12:54,410
She was in her little wheelchair and I said no.

4444
03:12:57,570 --> 03:12:59,350
I'm actually gonna cry.

4445
03:13:02,090 --> 03:13:04,330
Her grandma was so nice.

4446
03:13:04,830 --> 03:13:06,730
Stop talking about my grandma.

4447
03:13:07,310 --> 03:13:09,570
You smooch a picture of her.

4448
03:13:09,690 --> 03:13:11,670
Yeah, you can smooch a picture of her.

4449
03:13:12,170 --> 03:13:15,850
She invited me to Thanksgiving next year, but now I can't come.

4450
03:13:15,930 --> 03:13:16,910
She won't be there.

4451
03:13:17,590 --> 03:13:18,330
That's so sweet.

4452
03:13:18,510 --> 03:13:19,490
Oh, there's more frog.

4453
03:13:19,650 --> 03:13:20,210
More frog.

4454
03:13:21,550 --> 03:13:23,270
Oh, I also got this thing.

4455
03:13:24,390 --> 03:13:26,310
Cinder, it like caught me off guard, right?

4456
03:13:26,410 --> 03:13:27,990
Because she was like, oh, she died two weeks.

4457
03:13:28,090 --> 03:13:28,770
I thought she was kidding.

4458
03:13:29,090 --> 03:13:30,650
I was like, there's no way, like...

4459
03:13:30,650 --> 03:13:32,170
Why would I joke about that?

4460
03:13:32,730 --> 03:13:33,730
Wait, where'd the cart go?

4461
03:13:33,850 --> 03:13:34,590
Where'd the cart go?

4462
03:13:35,150 --> 03:13:36,290
It's back at the base.

4463
03:13:36,430 --> 03:13:36,690
Okay.

4464
03:13:37,870 --> 03:13:38,970
Oh God, that got me.

4465
03:13:39,110 --> 03:13:39,750
That got me.

4466
03:13:45,630 --> 03:13:46,430
I can't.

4467
03:13:46,610 --> 03:13:47,610
I can't help.

4468
03:13:47,970 --> 03:13:49,530
I can't believe this is happening.

4469
03:13:49,530 --> 03:13:51,190
In this game.

4470
03:13:53,330 --> 03:13:55,610
I can't believe we're having this conversation.

4471
03:13:56,650 --> 03:13:57,910
It's not at base.

4472
03:13:58,910 --> 03:13:59,950
Matara Kanyu, liar.

4473
03:14:04,290 --> 03:14:07,590
I can't believe we're having this conversation in this way.

4474
03:14:07,750 --> 03:14:09,290
It's too funny.

4475
03:14:11,130 --> 03:14:12,050
I'm evil?

4476
03:14:12,430 --> 03:14:13,290
I should have said nothing.

4477
03:14:13,530 --> 03:14:15,510
I should have just said she was fine.

4478
03:14:17,110 --> 03:14:19,510
I should have just said she was fine.

4479
03:14:20,290 --> 03:14:21,170
Where's the cart?

4480
03:14:24,750 --> 03:14:26,710
Maybe, maybe it went this way.

4481
03:14:33,930 --> 03:14:35,010
Lie malicious.

4482
03:14:44,170 --> 03:14:46,450
The frogs just hopped past me.

4483
03:14:50,230 --> 03:14:51,070
There's the cart.

4484
03:14:51,930 --> 03:14:52,930
I found the cart.

4485
03:14:53,090 --> 03:14:53,650
Oh my God.

4486
03:14:53,990 --> 03:14:55,070
You did find the cart.

4487
03:14:56,150 --> 03:14:58,610
Sorry, I was moving it out of the way of frogs.

4488
03:14:58,810 --> 03:15:00,870
The frogs hopped right past me.

4489
03:15:00,990 --> 03:15:01,950
Oh my God, they hopped right past me.

4490
03:15:02,430 --> 03:15:03,670
They're hurting each other.

4491
03:15:04,370 --> 03:15:04,930
Oh, that's cool.

4492
03:15:05,650 --> 03:15:05,990
Good.

4493
03:15:10,070 --> 03:15:11,110
Uh-oh.

4494
03:15:11,610 --> 03:15:11,930
You good?

4495
03:15:17,700 --> 03:15:18,200
Diamond.

4496
03:15:22,340 --> 03:15:23,580
And the cart's gone.

4497
03:15:24,300 --> 03:15:25,580
I think it went this way.

4498
03:15:27,720 --> 03:15:28,180
Cart.

4499
03:15:30,240 --> 03:15:30,700
Cart.

4500
03:15:31,060 --> 03:15:31,480
There it is.

4501
03:15:31,880 --> 03:15:32,800
I found a diamond too.

4502
03:15:34,100 --> 03:15:34,560
Wow.

4503
03:15:37,360 --> 03:15:41,600
I'm sure glad there's so much delicate loot on this level with like 18 billion frogs in it.

4504
03:15:41,860 --> 03:15:43,600
There's a thing up here.

4505
03:15:49,120 --> 03:15:50,760
I don't know what to tell you man.

4506
03:15:50,760 --> 03:15:51,840
I don't know what to tell you.

4507
03:15:56,300 --> 03:15:57,880
Oh my God, there's a frog coming.

4508
03:15:58,140 --> 03:15:58,180
No!

4509
03:16:01,360 --> 03:16:02,340
To the cart!

4510
03:16:03,600 --> 03:16:04,560
Save the loot!

4511
03:16:05,120 --> 03:16:06,000
Save the loot!

4512
03:16:06,240 --> 03:16:06,680
I saved it.

4513
03:16:06,760 --> 03:16:06,960
We're good.

4514
03:16:07,740 --> 03:16:09,220
Let me go lead the frog out, ok?

4515
03:16:09,440 --> 03:16:10,080
But keep looking.

4516
03:16:10,240 --> 03:16:11,540
There's a bunch of loot around still.

4517
03:16:15,920 --> 03:16:17,060
He's right next to the loot!

4518
03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:18,460
Don't bring it here!

4519
03:16:18,460 --> 03:16:20,020
He's right next to the loot!

4520
03:16:21,140 --> 03:16:21,840
I'm leading him away.

4521
03:16:21,920 --> 03:16:22,500
I'm leading him away.

4522
03:16:31,500 --> 03:16:33,860
Do we know where the next extraction point is?

4523
03:16:33,960 --> 03:16:34,220
Grab.

4524
03:16:34,660 --> 03:16:35,780
We gotta find it.

4525
03:16:36,300 --> 03:16:37,160
We can actually keep...

4526
03:16:37,160 --> 03:16:38,140
I think we have enough people.

4527
03:16:39,620 --> 03:16:40,300
To grab him?

4528
03:16:40,580 --> 03:16:40,980
People?

4529
03:16:41,400 --> 03:16:41,920
Oh yeah.

4530
03:16:42,740 --> 03:16:43,100
Do we?

4531
03:16:43,420 --> 03:16:44,080
Oh fudge, sorry.

4532
03:16:44,220 --> 03:16:45,420
We got like four of us.

4533
03:16:45,520 --> 03:16:46,120
We should be alright.

4534
03:16:46,300 --> 03:16:46,880
We can try.

4535
03:16:48,720 --> 03:16:49,240
Where'd he go?

4536
03:16:49,660 --> 03:16:50,700
There's two more though.

4537
03:16:51,200 --> 03:16:51,820
Grab him!

4538
03:16:52,280 --> 03:16:52,900
Grab him!

4539
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:55,440
Up!

4540
03:16:55,700 --> 03:16:55,980
Up!

4541
03:16:56,160 --> 03:16:56,540
Down!

4542
03:16:56,980 --> 03:16:57,420
Up!

4543
03:16:57,420 --> 03:16:57,860
Up!

4544
03:16:58,360 --> 03:16:58,800
Down!

4545
03:16:59,940 --> 03:17:00,380
Up!

4546
03:17:00,380 --> 03:17:00,820
Up!

4547
03:17:00,820 --> 03:17:01,060
Down!

4548
03:17:01,700 --> 03:17:01,900
Up!

4549
03:17:02,640 --> 03:17:02,880
Up!

4550
03:17:02,880 --> 03:17:03,000
Down!

4551
03:17:03,960 --> 03:17:04,400
Up!

4552
03:17:04,400 --> 03:17:04,620
Up!

4553
03:17:04,720 --> 03:17:05,340
Ok, but watch out!

4554
03:17:05,880 --> 03:17:08,760
Ok, grab him again!

4555
03:17:08,900 --> 03:17:09,160
Grab him again!

4556
03:17:09,760 --> 03:17:10,280
Grab him!

4557
03:17:10,360 --> 03:17:10,660
Grab him!

4558
03:17:11,020 --> 03:17:11,360
Grab him!

4559
03:17:11,880 --> 03:17:12,400
In the wall!

4560
03:17:12,460 --> 03:17:12,840
In the wall!

4561
03:17:17,360 --> 03:17:19,340
Oh yeah, easy game.

4562
03:17:21,220 --> 03:17:22,820
Let me get this out of the way.

4563
03:17:22,820 --> 03:17:23,720
Grab him!

4564
03:17:25,320 --> 03:17:25,840
Grabbing.

4565
03:17:26,540 --> 03:17:27,060
Up!

4566
03:17:28,640 --> 03:17:29,540
We need all four.

4567
03:17:33,320 --> 03:17:35,380
I think we need five minimum.

4568
03:17:35,720 --> 03:17:36,300
Or like four.

4569
03:17:36,500 --> 03:17:37,220
No, no, we need four.

4570
03:17:38,940 --> 03:17:40,080
It's because she has plus two.

4571
03:17:41,160 --> 03:17:42,020
Ok, move him.

4572
03:17:48,030 --> 03:17:49,770
I got strength plus.

4573
03:17:50,490 --> 03:17:51,650
I grabbed him.

4574
03:17:51,650 --> 03:17:52,670
I grabbed him.

4575
03:17:53,460 --> 03:17:53,850
Up!

4576
03:17:54,930 --> 03:17:55,710
Down!

4577
03:17:56,250 --> 03:17:56,610
Up!

4578
03:17:57,270 --> 03:17:57,790
Down!

4579
03:17:58,570 --> 03:17:59,310
Nice!

4580
03:17:59,970 --> 03:18:01,730
Easy, easy, easy.

4581
03:18:02,370 --> 03:18:03,570
Grab Cinder's head.

4582
03:18:04,290 --> 03:18:05,310
No, it was Matara.

4583
03:18:09,890 --> 03:18:12,510
I'm no longer alive.

4584
03:18:12,990 --> 03:18:14,150
I'm sorry Cinder.

4585
03:18:14,470 --> 03:18:15,390
Where is it?

4586
03:18:16,150 --> 03:18:17,970
I'm sorry you had to find out this way.

4587
03:18:19,810 --> 03:18:21,270
I'm looking around.

4588
03:18:22,810 --> 03:18:24,770
We must be able to find it.

4589
03:18:25,050 --> 03:18:26,450
I will find it.

4590
03:18:26,610 --> 03:18:27,810
With my own hands.

4591
03:18:28,470 --> 03:18:29,430
Maybe down here?

4592
03:18:32,870 --> 03:18:34,510
Though it looks like we've been all through here.

4593
03:18:35,890 --> 03:18:36,170
Oh wait.

4594
03:18:37,190 --> 03:18:37,710
Oh wait.

4595
03:18:40,370 --> 03:18:41,210
Found it!

4596
03:18:43,910 --> 03:18:44,510
Aha!

4597
03:18:49,640 --> 03:18:51,100
Who does it?

4598
03:18:58,590 --> 03:19:02,290
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

4599
03:19:07,100 --> 03:19:08,280
I'll go get them.

4600
03:19:08,940 --> 03:19:09,440
In a moment.

4601
03:19:10,280 --> 03:19:10,380
Hello!

4602
03:19:14,700 --> 03:19:15,680
She's alive.

4603
03:19:22,940 --> 03:19:23,540
There we go.

4604
03:19:27,900 --> 03:19:30,100
Can I put this diamond in here?

4605
03:19:30,860 --> 03:19:31,780
So that...

4606
03:19:35,480 --> 03:19:37,700
There we go.

4607
03:19:42,420 --> 03:19:43,740
I got it, I got it.

4608
03:19:43,740 --> 03:19:43,980
We're good.

4609
03:19:44,420 --> 03:19:44,900
Nice!

4610
03:19:46,940 --> 03:19:48,200
That doesn't look like it carries at all.

4611
03:19:51,780 --> 03:19:52,260
Yay!

4612
03:19:57,820 --> 03:19:58,060
Be careful.

4613
03:19:59,380 --> 03:20:01,080
It's just some frogs.

4614
03:20:01,580 --> 03:20:02,700
It's just some...

4615
03:20:04,180 --> 03:20:06,700
Holy shit they're back for revenge!

4616
03:20:09,920 --> 03:20:10,600
Cinder!

4617
03:20:10,940 --> 03:20:11,320
Run!

4618
03:20:11,840 --> 03:20:12,140
I'm OK.

4619
03:20:13,800 --> 03:20:14,700
Oh yeah, I'm dead.

4620
03:20:14,780 --> 03:20:15,820
Just let me...

4621
03:20:40,530 --> 03:20:41,750
Is anyone alive?

4622
03:20:43,770 --> 03:20:44,450
No,

4623
03:20:49,380 --> 03:20:49,540
please.

4624
03:20:50,680 --> 03:20:51,440
OK!

4625
03:20:54,020 --> 03:20:54,780
Wait, Lime!

4626
03:20:55,580 --> 03:20:56,000
Lime!

4627
03:20:59,320 --> 03:21:00,620
He's so cute.

4628
03:21:04,440 --> 03:21:05,640
I had to Lime.

4629
03:21:05,740 --> 03:21:06,160
I'm sorry.

4630
03:21:15,210 --> 03:21:16,290
Let's go!

4631
03:21:20,210 --> 03:21:21,670
Oh my God!

4632
03:21:21,670 --> 03:21:23,550
I thought you guys were dead.

4633
03:21:25,850 --> 03:21:27,550
I thought you guys...

4634
03:21:27,550 --> 03:21:28,010
Hello!

4635
03:21:28,870 --> 03:21:30,970
That was crazy.

4636
03:21:33,090 --> 03:21:36,010
Every single frog came down there like, remember us?

4637
03:21:36,210 --> 03:21:36,750
I know!

4638
03:21:37,110 --> 03:21:41,430
How are you on time Lime?

4639
03:21:42,370 --> 03:21:42,850
Yeah.

4640
03:21:43,990 --> 03:21:45,170
Got time for one more.

4641
03:21:45,390 --> 03:21:47,290
One more round and then I had to go.

4642
03:21:48,070 --> 03:21:48,490
That's OK.

4643
03:21:49,110 --> 03:21:51,870
We should get a double jump for someone...

4644
03:21:51,870 --> 03:21:53,550
so that they can get to those higher places.

4645
03:21:53,830 --> 03:21:54,890
You should get double jump.

4646
03:21:55,170 --> 03:21:56,370
For no reason other than it would be funny.

4647
03:21:57,390 --> 03:21:58,270
Extra jump.

4648
03:22:00,030 --> 03:22:00,910
And stamina.

4649
03:22:01,810 --> 03:22:03,690
Well, we should like spend all our money, right?

4650
03:22:05,330 --> 03:22:05,770
Because...

4651
03:22:05,770 --> 03:22:09,630
Who wants a tumble launch?

4652
03:22:11,850 --> 03:22:13,130
A tumble launch?

4653
03:22:13,350 --> 03:22:15,070
Me, launching you into the sky.

4654
03:22:15,150 --> 03:22:16,190
What's a feather drone?

4655
03:22:17,530 --> 03:22:19,810
Oh, it makes items much lighter.

4656
03:22:22,350 --> 03:22:25,070
I guess it's unnecessary if you're packing strength.

4657
03:22:25,370 --> 03:22:25,570
Yeah.

4658
03:22:27,290 --> 03:22:28,650
She's got them guns.

4659
03:22:29,310 --> 03:22:31,010
She's got them guns.

4660
03:22:33,870 --> 03:22:35,670
Oh, can I also steal?

4661
03:22:36,610 --> 03:22:38,010
How do I rotate by the way?

4662
03:22:38,290 --> 03:22:39,350
Somebody asked me to rotate.

4663
03:22:39,610 --> 03:22:40,510
Hold right click.

4664
03:22:40,510 --> 03:22:40,630
Hold right click.

4665
03:22:45,290 --> 03:22:47,210
Wait, medium.

4666
03:22:47,570 --> 03:22:48,210
Is there a large?

4667
03:22:51,250 --> 03:22:51,710
Medium.

4668
03:23:00,170 --> 03:23:01,250
She did!

4669
03:23:01,390 --> 03:23:01,910
She did!

4670
03:23:02,270 --> 03:23:02,830
She did!

4671
03:23:06,590 --> 03:23:08,230
Alright, start the boat.

4672
03:23:08,230 --> 03:23:09,390
Wait, who's starting the boat?

4673
03:23:10,270 --> 03:23:11,270
I can start the boat.

4674
03:23:12,190 --> 03:23:14,170
You're busy stealing, so I'll do it.

4675
03:23:21,110 --> 03:23:22,570
I'm not going to heaven, baby!

4676
03:23:23,170 --> 03:23:24,210
I'm the thief!

4677
03:23:26,990 --> 03:23:30,090
Wait, which one is the jump?

4678
03:23:30,750 --> 03:23:31,190
Blue.

4679
03:23:32,030 --> 03:23:32,570
Oh, thank you.

4680
03:23:32,570 --> 03:23:34,270
Make sure you have at least 50 stamina.

4681
03:23:36,030 --> 03:23:37,250
I got 50 stamina.

4682
03:23:40,610 --> 03:23:41,810
We're so back.

4683
03:23:42,190 --> 03:23:45,430
We never left.

4684
03:23:45,730 --> 03:23:46,650
Let's go stealing!

4685
03:23:47,950 --> 03:23:49,090
They'll patch it out.

4686
03:23:51,370 --> 03:23:55,450
Somebody said it would be funny if when they patch it out, it just makes you explode.

4687
03:23:57,250 --> 03:23:59,230
Do they penalize you?

4688
03:23:59,290 --> 03:24:00,010
Yeah, that would be good.

4689
03:24:04,320 --> 03:24:06,360
That's better than fixing it.

4690
03:24:06,540 --> 03:24:06,860
Wait, what?

4691
03:24:07,360 --> 03:24:08,520
Oh, there's the other door.

4692
03:24:09,780 --> 03:24:10,780
Oh yeah, this is...

4693
03:24:15,060 --> 03:24:17,920
This is just a long hallway.

4694
03:24:19,040 --> 03:24:20,420
Such a crowded house.

4695
03:24:22,180 --> 03:24:22,980
What's that?

4696
03:24:28,960 --> 03:24:30,200
Buffalicious, oh yeah!

4697
03:24:31,540 --> 03:24:32,720
Put it in.

4698
03:24:33,000 --> 03:24:33,960
I got something else here too.

4699
03:24:37,240 --> 03:24:39,100
Oh, look at you with the little jumpies.

4700
03:24:39,380 --> 03:24:39,520
I know.

4701
03:24:41,020 --> 03:24:43,700
I'm putting my thing to use.

4702
03:24:45,200 --> 03:24:48,100
My thing to use.

4703
03:24:48,360 --> 03:24:48,640
Well,

4704
03:24:52,280 --> 03:24:54,320
they probably would if you didn't eat them.

4705
03:25:03,050 --> 03:25:04,630
I found another TV!

4706
03:25:17,440 --> 03:25:18,720
Where is...this way?

4707
03:25:19,020 --> 03:25:20,580
I don't know where the cart is.

4708
03:25:25,260 --> 03:25:27,600
I'll take that TV back to spawn.

4709
03:25:27,700 --> 03:25:28,180
Don't worry.

4710
03:25:28,700 --> 03:25:29,040
I got you.

4711
03:25:29,580 --> 03:25:30,800
Yeah, take it back.

4712
03:25:34,080 --> 03:25:36,160
Take it boy, thank you sir.

4713
03:25:36,420 --> 03:25:38,080
Yeah, take it real good.

4714
03:25:42,920 --> 03:25:43,740
What's around?

4715
03:25:45,540 --> 03:25:46,920
Actually, I think I'm lost.

4716
03:25:48,220 --> 03:25:49,180
Guys, I'm lost.

4717
03:25:52,970 --> 03:25:54,110
Is this to spawn?

4718
03:25:58,180 --> 03:25:59,160
I think so.

4719
03:25:59,900 --> 03:26:01,820
Yep, I knew it.

4720
03:26:02,280 --> 03:26:04,460
Silent Hill fucking music out here.

4721
03:26:04,600 --> 03:26:05,020
I know!

4722
03:26:06,300 --> 03:26:07,360
What could it be?

4723
03:26:07,500 --> 03:26:09,140
What could our creature of the week be?

4724
03:26:10,540 --> 03:26:11,540
I hope it's a gooner.

4725
03:26:12,640 --> 03:26:13,520
You won.

4726
03:26:18,560 --> 03:26:21,420
Oh that's why I didn't know, because I didn't go this way.

4727
03:26:30,790 --> 03:26:31,870
Another television?

4728
03:26:32,790 --> 03:26:35,850
That scared me.

4729
03:26:38,290 --> 03:26:38,650
Grandma!

4730
03:26:44,270 --> 03:26:46,750
There is a big snowy man in there.

4731
03:26:59,400 --> 03:27:03,580
I forget how you like... I think he's just very slow and like...

4732
03:27:03,580 --> 03:27:04,840
I don't know what he...

4733
03:27:05,340 --> 03:27:06,280
He didn't hurt me.

4734
03:27:07,920 --> 03:27:09,700
How do we... how do we...

4735
03:27:09,700 --> 03:27:10,900
How do we fight him everybody?

4736
03:27:11,700 --> 03:27:13,320
What the fuck was that noise?

4737
03:27:16,060 --> 03:27:16,900
What was that?

4738
03:27:17,860 --> 03:27:18,680
What was that sound?

4739
03:27:19,340 --> 03:27:20,020
Oh, it was the fireplace?

4740
03:27:20,080 --> 03:27:21,440
What was that noise?

4741
03:27:21,720 --> 03:27:22,800
It's a big snowy man.

4742
03:27:23,760 --> 03:27:25,520
Oh, the marshmallow man?

4743
03:27:25,520 --> 03:27:26,800
I don't know.

4744
03:27:29,560 --> 03:27:31,020
Is Martha alive?

4745
03:27:37,060 --> 03:27:39,300
I wanna see the baby!

4746
03:27:39,760 --> 03:27:40,900
Yeah, the don't look baby.

4747
03:27:41,420 --> 03:27:43,240
I wanna see the don't look baby.

4748
03:27:43,920 --> 03:27:47,120
You can look for like half a second, but then you better look away.

4749
03:27:47,840 --> 03:27:48,220
Baby.

4750
03:27:50,220 --> 03:27:51,180
I don't hear him.

4751
03:27:53,280 --> 03:27:53,840
Oh!

4752
03:27:54,440 --> 03:27:56,060
Is it the giant head?

4753
03:27:58,940 --> 03:28:01,780
Wait, was it the guy at the top of the stairs?

4754
03:28:11,880 --> 03:28:13,320
Is that a baby?

4755
03:28:13,800 --> 03:28:15,120
I thought that was grandpa.

4756
03:28:29,850 --> 03:28:31,070
That's not the baby.

4757
03:28:31,070 --> 03:28:33,250
Can I have someone carry the other end of this statue?

4758
03:28:33,570 --> 03:28:34,310
This is rough.

4759
03:28:40,580 --> 03:28:42,660
Oh, that's... that's Joe Biden.

4760
03:28:44,300 --> 03:28:45,520
Not this way.

4761
03:28:45,780 --> 03:28:46,460
It's not this way.

4762
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:50,240
I've been dead the whole time you guys.

4763
03:28:52,500 --> 03:28:53,480
I'm having more popcorn.

4764
03:28:54,620 --> 03:28:56,660
We're watching a TV show everybody.

4765
03:29:01,180 --> 03:29:02,460
To me, to you.

4766
03:29:02,640 --> 03:29:03,240
Wait, Mint's head?

4767
03:29:12,320 --> 03:29:13,460
Did they find me?

4768
03:29:14,540 --> 03:29:15,340
Don't you girl me.

4769
03:29:15,400 --> 03:29:16,400
That was a joint effort.

4770
03:29:18,680 --> 03:29:19,900
Lift it up a little bit.

4771
03:29:19,940 --> 03:29:20,340
It's sliding.

4772
03:29:20,640 --> 03:29:21,480
They found the head.

4773
03:29:22,440 --> 03:29:23,520
Okay, you wanna swing right.

4774
03:29:24,540 --> 03:29:25,100
Swing right.

4775
03:29:26,080 --> 03:29:28,420
Oh my gosh, this is the worst part.

4776
03:29:28,420 --> 03:29:29,120
Careful, careful, careful.

4777
03:29:30,480 --> 03:29:33,580
We're trying to Tetris your furniture in.

4778
03:29:35,980 --> 03:29:36,960
Thread the needle.

4779
03:29:37,800 --> 03:29:38,660
Thread the needle.

4780
03:29:39,880 --> 03:29:42,800
Beautiful, beautiful.

4781
03:29:44,840 --> 03:29:48,740
To my side, to my side.

4782
03:29:50,180 --> 03:29:52,860
Okay, it's just 10k worth of value we've managed to knock off.

4783
03:29:54,240 --> 03:29:55,100
Who's we?

4784
03:29:55,860 --> 03:29:57,660
What do you mean who's we?

4785
03:29:58,280 --> 03:29:59,400
Who's carrying the other...

4786
03:29:59,400 --> 03:29:59,820
Wait, wait, wait.

4787
03:29:59,820 --> 03:30:00,200
Don't do that.

4788
03:30:00,380 --> 03:30:01,000
We'll cap.

4789
03:30:02,840 --> 03:30:03,520
That's cap.

4790
03:30:04,760 --> 03:30:05,160
Motherfucker.

4791
03:30:06,720 --> 03:30:08,000
Okay, I'm gonna...

4792
03:30:08,500 --> 03:30:09,680
Let's put everything on...

4793
03:30:10,100 --> 03:30:10,880
Is Mint dead?

4794
03:30:12,520 --> 03:30:14,940
Just in case, let's go try to find her to make sure.

4795
03:30:15,400 --> 03:30:16,980
Let's keep this card with us.

4796
03:30:17,160 --> 03:30:18,520
Because we're gonna take it to the next point.

4797
03:30:21,520 --> 03:30:23,100
One second, don't...

4798
03:30:23,100 --> 03:30:26,240
I can't really tell some of the monsters apart.

4799
03:30:26,780 --> 03:30:28,300
Well, I've never seen the baby.

4800
03:30:28,900 --> 03:30:29,860
I hope I see the baby.

4801
03:30:34,660 --> 03:30:35,940
The head.

4802
03:30:44,780 --> 03:30:47,660
Where is my little stinky girl?

4803
03:30:47,660 --> 03:30:53,120
It'd be so crazy if a scary ghost came out of the walls.

4804
03:30:54,140 --> 03:30:55,240
I mean, popcorn.

4805
03:30:59,180 --> 03:31:05,080
If only there was a ghost that could jump out and go BOO!

4806
03:31:08,080 --> 03:31:09,760
I don't know where the fuck she is.

4807
03:31:11,700 --> 03:31:12,820
I fear...

4808
03:31:12,820 --> 03:31:15,160
There's a lot more loot here as well, but Matara took the card.

4809
03:31:16,000 --> 03:31:16,520
Yeah.

4810
03:31:17,440 --> 03:31:17,980
Mint, baby!

4811
03:31:19,180 --> 03:31:20,760
Where's my little stinky girl?

4812
03:31:22,560 --> 03:31:25,580
That scared the bejeebies out of me.

4813
03:31:25,720 --> 03:31:26,300
What is she doing?

4814
03:31:26,480 --> 03:31:29,620
How are they not going down the hallway that I died in?

4815
03:31:29,920 --> 03:31:30,960
Oh wait, I died right here!

4816
03:31:31,600 --> 03:31:32,420
I think she's dead.

4817
03:31:32,800 --> 03:31:34,240
Wait, I died in there!

4818
03:31:35,600 --> 03:31:37,080
They just didn't notice.

4819
03:31:37,740 --> 03:31:38,960
That's where I died!

4820
03:31:40,060 --> 03:31:41,520
They didn't notice my head!

4821
03:31:41,760 --> 03:31:43,240
I'm extremely bad at driving this car.

4822
03:31:44,400 --> 03:31:46,440
You're extremely bad at everything, MataraCon.

4823
03:31:49,270 --> 03:31:50,890
And my head was in the closet!

4824
03:31:51,890 --> 03:31:53,450
I died in the closet!

4825
03:32:02,590 --> 03:32:03,890
Where's all the monsters?

4826
03:32:05,550 --> 03:32:07,690
It's like they gave up after they killed me.

4827
03:32:11,050 --> 03:32:12,110
I saw it all.

4828
03:32:12,110 --> 03:32:13,870
And it's all on my stream.

4829
03:32:14,050 --> 03:32:15,890
Where's my stinky little girl?

4830
03:32:16,130 --> 03:32:16,530
Mint!

4831
03:32:17,670 --> 03:32:19,970
If only there was a stinky little girl!

4832
03:32:20,990 --> 03:32:22,310
She's so obsessed with me!

4833
03:32:22,490 --> 03:32:22,990
I can't!

4834
03:32:27,970 --> 03:32:29,110
She's definitely dead.

4835
03:32:29,270 --> 03:32:30,270
They're not going to find my head.

4836
03:32:32,490 --> 03:32:34,550
And then I won't be able to play the rest of the game.

4837
03:32:38,580 --> 03:32:39,360
Oh, hello!

4838
03:32:40,200 --> 03:32:40,940
Not up there either?

4839
03:32:41,440 --> 03:32:44,060
The other extraction point is right ahead down there.

4840
03:32:44,440 --> 03:32:44,900
Okay.

4841
03:32:45,500 --> 03:32:46,940
There's that at least, but...

4842
03:32:46,940 --> 03:32:49,300
I appear to have lost the cart, and Mata, and Mint.

4843
03:32:52,540 --> 03:32:54,160
I can't even see it on the map.

4844
03:32:54,660 --> 03:32:56,180
No, that's it ahead, right?

4845
03:32:56,700 --> 03:32:58,140
I think I just found Mint.

4846
03:32:58,660 --> 03:32:58,980
Yeah!

4847
03:33:00,760 --> 03:33:02,980
Wait, are you kidding me?

4848
03:33:03,020 --> 03:33:04,820
I went in there and I didn't see her!

4849
03:33:05,860 --> 03:33:07,900
She's probably laughing at you.

4850
03:33:08,100 --> 03:33:09,360
She's laughing at you.

4851
03:33:09,360 --> 03:33:11,440
I'm not even here, so...

4852
03:33:13,400 --> 03:33:17,560
Okay, I'm going to do the first extraction point though and get Mint back.

4853
03:33:18,300 --> 03:33:19,140
She did it on purpose.

4854
03:33:19,760 --> 03:33:19,920
Okay.

4855
03:33:22,740 --> 03:33:24,300
I should eat real dinner.

4856
03:33:24,920 --> 03:33:25,500
Girl dinner!

4857
03:33:28,100 --> 03:33:28,940
Girl dinner!

4858
03:33:35,750 --> 03:33:36,550
Marshmallow man.

4859
03:33:49,450 --> 03:33:50,250
What is he...

4860
03:33:51,330 --> 03:33:52,490
What is he aggroed on?

4861
03:33:53,070 --> 03:33:54,390
Wait, there's something else in there.

4862
03:33:55,590 --> 03:33:55,950
What?

4863
03:33:56,150 --> 03:33:56,910
What was that?

4864
03:34:00,040 --> 03:34:01,020
Share some for us?

4865
03:34:01,400 --> 03:34:03,200
You wouldn't want it, it's stale popcorn.

4866
03:34:05,960 --> 03:34:07,080
Unless you like that.

4867
03:34:09,380 --> 03:34:10,620
What about babies?

4868
03:34:12,900 --> 03:34:14,880
I think he can see you, I'm not sure.

4869
03:34:15,640 --> 03:34:15,980
It's okay.

4870
03:34:23,000 --> 03:34:23,860
Ding dong!

4871
03:34:28,390 --> 03:34:29,550
Lost so much money.

4872
03:34:29,730 --> 03:34:30,310
Oh my god!

4873
03:34:35,350 --> 03:34:35,970
I'm...

4874
03:34:37,350 --> 03:34:38,590
I'm alive!

4875
03:34:40,450 --> 03:34:40,990
Hi!

4876
03:34:41,210 --> 03:34:44,490
I'm so glad you found my body because Matarou...

4877
03:34:44,490 --> 03:34:51,470
Did you see the marshmallow fighting the baby?

4878
03:34:51,590 --> 03:34:52,230
That was weird.

4879
03:34:52,230 --> 03:34:52,470
What was that?

4880
03:34:53,270 --> 03:34:54,750
Oh shit, shit, shit.

4881
03:34:56,770 --> 03:34:57,610
That's the marshmallow.

4882
03:34:58,010 --> 03:34:59,110
Is he fighting the baby, you think?

4883
03:35:00,030 --> 03:35:00,410
Maybe.

4884
03:35:02,070 --> 03:35:02,450
Shit.

4885
03:35:05,350 --> 03:35:06,410
Oh, he's coming, I think.

4886
03:35:07,690 --> 03:35:08,150
No, he's not.

4887
03:35:09,410 --> 03:35:10,270
I'm gonna check.

4888
03:35:16,430 --> 03:35:17,430
We're okay for now.

4889
03:35:18,990 --> 03:35:20,350
I'm gonna grab the money.

4890
03:35:23,430 --> 03:35:24,910
I don't think I'll ever see the baby.

4891
03:35:24,910 --> 03:35:26,950
Oh, let me heal you a little bit as well, hold on.

4892
03:35:26,970 --> 03:35:27,470
Oh, thank you.

4893
03:35:33,100 --> 03:35:33,780
There you go.

4894
03:35:35,060 --> 03:35:35,420
Alright.

4895
03:35:36,340 --> 03:35:39,360
Oh, I can't get used to the sounds yet.

4896
03:35:42,300 --> 03:35:44,500
I'll let you lead since I'm not sure where to go.

4897
03:35:45,660 --> 03:35:45,840
Okay.

4898
03:35:46,220 --> 03:35:49,040
If you open your map, you can actually see the white box...

4899
03:35:49,040 --> 03:35:49,300
Oh, that's right!

4900
03:35:49,860 --> 03:35:50,920
Yeah, thank you.

4901
03:35:54,000 --> 03:35:54,840
Marshmallow's in here, careful.

4902
03:35:59,640 --> 03:36:00,080
Okay.

4903
03:36:12,640 --> 03:36:13,600
Can he hear me?

4904
03:36:15,200 --> 03:36:15,920
Did he just turn around?

4905
03:36:16,080 --> 03:36:16,160
No.

4906
03:36:16,740 --> 03:36:17,340
Okay, we're good.

4907
03:36:20,720 --> 03:36:21,900
Okay, come this way.

4908
03:36:23,560 --> 03:36:24,200
I'm coming.

4909
03:36:34,000 --> 03:36:34,440
Okay.

4910
03:36:39,820 --> 03:36:43,000
Matara Khan, you blind old roach, what the hell?

4911
03:36:47,560 --> 03:36:49,680
I think we just escaped with what we got.

4912
03:36:50,120 --> 03:36:51,600
We got a lot of money.

4913
03:36:52,080 --> 03:36:54,020
I need help, I need help, this is heavy.

4914
03:36:55,360 --> 03:36:57,580
Our sack of cash is too heavy.

4915
03:37:01,080 --> 03:37:02,340
Put it deeper, put it deeper.

4916
03:37:03,460 --> 03:37:05,360
Okay, step back.

4917
03:37:06,160 --> 03:37:06,560
Oh gosh.

4918
03:37:11,160 --> 03:37:12,060
Money, money!

4919
03:37:13,040 --> 03:37:13,880
Money, money!

4920
03:37:17,900 --> 03:37:19,220
That was a close one.

4921
03:37:19,320 --> 03:37:20,580
That was really close.

4922
03:37:22,720 --> 03:37:23,600
Let's go.

4923
03:37:26,460 --> 03:37:28,340
I'll never see the baby.

4924
03:37:30,320 --> 03:37:31,340
I wanna see the baby.

4925
03:37:31,440 --> 03:37:33,820
It got vacuumed a few times, it might honestly have died.

4926
03:37:34,280 --> 03:37:35,800
Oh, that's true, yeah.

4927
03:37:38,060 --> 03:37:40,600
It's in there, the marshmallow man and the baby were fighting.

4928
03:37:40,820 --> 03:37:42,120
Yeah, I was like...

4929
03:37:42,120 --> 03:37:42,280
Oh!

4930
03:38:00,800 --> 03:38:01,200
Motherfuck!

4931
03:38:01,420 --> 03:38:02,360
How did it get me?

4932
03:38:03,300 --> 03:38:05,580
I don't know, I'm sorry, I was flailing around there.

4933
03:38:05,660 --> 03:38:07,740
That was fucked up, I didn't even know he was here.

4934
03:38:07,920 --> 03:38:08,320
I know!

4935
03:38:09,060 --> 03:38:10,920
That's what got me before, but yeah.

4936
03:38:12,660 --> 03:38:14,260
It would have been nice to know.

4937
03:38:14,880 --> 03:38:15,760
Oh, sorry.

4938
03:38:17,480 --> 03:38:18,280
It's fine.

4939
03:38:18,580 --> 03:38:18,940
I was dead.

4940
03:38:20,900 --> 03:38:23,440
You know, that guy sucks, he's so aggressive.

4941
03:38:23,640 --> 03:38:26,140
I didn't know he was here, the marshmallow man blew me into him.

4942
03:38:26,140 --> 03:38:26,700
No!

4943
03:38:31,610 --> 03:38:33,650
Cinder's got this, Cinder's got this.

4944
03:38:33,710 --> 03:38:35,710
Matara is singing.

4945
03:38:37,950 --> 03:38:41,490
Oh well, Matara at least can leave if we all die.

4946
03:38:46,220 --> 03:38:49,840
I'm glad this game doesn't really punish you for losing your other teammates.

4947
03:38:53,100 --> 03:38:54,540
Does she know the way?

4948
03:38:56,920 --> 03:38:59,640
She should know the way because it's marked.

4949
03:38:59,640 --> 03:39:01,640
Yeah, they're good, they're great.

4950
03:39:03,520 --> 03:39:05,480
I heard a baby.

4951
03:39:06,180 --> 03:39:07,300
Yeah, the baby's around.

4952
03:39:16,280 --> 03:39:18,240
No, I don't!

4953
03:39:23,660 --> 03:39:26,380
I wish there were mimics in this game.

4954
03:39:29,640 --> 03:39:31,760
That would be awful, but funny.

4955
03:39:33,600 --> 03:39:38,980
I feel like with how much stuff you pick up, they'd have to have a tell.

4956
03:39:39,400 --> 03:39:40,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4957
03:39:44,560 --> 03:39:48,440
I don't know if they saw.

4958
03:39:49,040 --> 03:39:50,680
I don't know if they saw.

4959
03:39:56,720 --> 03:40:00,360
We were dead, we were dead.

4960
03:40:00,880 --> 03:40:01,680
How'd you die?

4961
03:40:01,800 --> 03:40:02,240
How'd you die?

4962
03:40:02,500 --> 03:40:03,360
The big head.

4963
03:40:04,400 --> 03:40:05,500
How did he...

4964
03:40:05,500 --> 03:40:09,520
The marshmallow man blew me into Joe Biden and then Joe Biden ate me.

4965
03:40:12,080 --> 03:40:13,000
That was fun!

4966
03:40:13,760 --> 03:40:14,780
It was!

4967
03:40:14,820 --> 03:40:16,340
Thank you so much everybody!

4968
03:40:17,360 --> 03:40:19,480
Thank you guys for organizing!

4969
03:40:20,660 --> 03:40:21,740
Yeah, thank you!

4970
03:40:21,760 --> 03:40:23,680
I'm glad we didn't end on a loss.

4971
03:40:24,460 --> 03:40:25,660
No, of course not.

4972
03:40:33,440 --> 03:40:34,360
No way!

4973
03:40:34,780 --> 03:40:36,740
Are you kidding me?!

4974
03:40:40,000 --> 03:40:42,300
I didn't think we could actually die in there.

4975
03:40:42,400 --> 03:40:43,240
I didn't think so either.

4976
03:40:44,220 --> 03:40:46,820
We could, we could, but they need to say goodbye.

4977
03:40:46,960 --> 03:40:48,100
I guess we could say goodbye on Discord.

4978
03:40:49,300 --> 03:40:50,960
Get it closer to you, get it closer.

4979
03:40:51,660 --> 03:40:52,540
There we go.

4980
03:40:53,140 --> 03:40:54,020
See you later, everybody.

4981
03:41:03,260 --> 03:41:04,320
Kill yourself wise.

4982
03:41:05,680 --> 03:41:06,320
Yay!

4983
03:41:12,980 --> 03:41:15,540
Thank you for organizing, Stender!

4984
03:41:15,940 --> 03:41:18,280
Thank you very much everybody!

4985
03:41:18,940 --> 03:41:21,500
We were able to have fun and hang out!

4986
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:23,060
Thank you!

4987
03:41:23,900 --> 03:41:26,200
And maybe we can all do something again another time.

4988
03:41:28,760 --> 03:41:30,220
Let's do this again soon.

4989
03:41:30,680 --> 03:41:32,260
Is anybody still streaming for a bit?

4990
03:41:34,540 --> 03:41:35,280
Stender, are you?

4991
03:41:36,000 --> 03:41:37,220
Okay, me too, darn it.

4992
03:41:38,800 --> 03:41:40,760
I'm all stoked because I have to pack.

4993
03:41:40,980 --> 03:41:42,180
Okay, well, it was awesome.

4994
03:41:47,900 --> 03:41:54,140
You got so big for your box!

4995
03:41:57,300 --> 03:41:58,380
Alright, bye girls!

4996
03:41:58,480 --> 03:41:59,040
Have a good one!

4997
03:41:59,040 --> 03:41:59,960
Bye-bye!

4998
03:42:00,680 --> 03:42:01,460
Thank you!

4999
03:42:02,140 --> 03:42:02,920
Bye-bye!

5000
03:42:03,100 --> 03:42:06,080
I only got the kiss, Stender.

5001
03:42:11,880 --> 03:42:14,420
Get out, Catboy!

5002
03:42:23,880 --> 03:42:25,960
Bye-bye!

5003
03:42:25,960 --> 03:42:26,860
Bye-bye!

5004
03:42:29,840 --> 03:42:30,110
Yay!

5005
03:42:36,100 --> 03:42:37,480
I died a lot.

5006
03:42:39,660 --> 03:42:41,680
I died so many times!

5007
03:42:42,160 --> 03:42:43,180
That was a lot of fun.

5008
03:42:43,560 --> 03:42:44,340
I like that game.

5009
03:42:44,860 --> 03:42:46,160
There are so many different monsters.

5010
03:42:46,940 --> 03:42:48,140
I never got to see the baby.

5011
03:43:04,640 --> 03:43:06,160
Try checking the mirror?

5012
03:43:14,830 --> 03:43:15,630
Solo run?

5013
03:43:15,950 --> 03:43:16,670
Nah, I think I'm done.

5014
03:43:16,810 --> 03:43:19,890
Actually, DMC has to get moved tomorrow.

5015
03:43:20,510 --> 03:43:21,690
To a little bit earlier.

5016
03:43:22,770 --> 03:43:24,770
So it's gonna be a midday stream for me.

5017
03:43:24,910 --> 03:43:27,570
So I'm gonna be heading out!

5018
03:43:28,730 --> 03:43:31,290
Thank you for all the gifted memberships, you guys!

5019
03:43:31,330 --> 03:43:32,610
Thank you for all the donos!

5020
03:43:35,010 --> 03:43:37,070
Sorry, it's hard to read.

5021
03:43:37,630 --> 03:43:39,810
Especially in a game like this where you're like...

5022
03:43:40,810 --> 03:43:43,070
Paying attention the mostest, you know?

5023
03:43:43,990 --> 03:43:46,610
I was like... My brain was like trying to figure out...

5024
03:43:46,610 --> 03:43:48,710
But I think by the end I really understood it.

5025
03:43:49,270 --> 03:43:50,750
Except all the different monsters.

5026
03:43:51,950 --> 03:43:54,470
Does the tutorial tell you what all the monsters do?

5027
03:43:54,610 --> 03:43:55,110
I don't know.

5028
03:43:56,190 --> 03:43:56,710
It's okay.

5029
03:43:58,190 --> 03:43:58,870
It's okay.

5030
03:44:00,610 --> 03:44:02,270
It's expected of during a collab.

5031
03:44:04,950 --> 03:44:06,050
But I had a lot of fun.

5032
03:44:06,130 --> 03:44:07,770
Hopefully I can play this game again.

5033
03:44:07,770 --> 03:44:09,910
Since it's the hot stuff right now.

5034
03:44:10,450 --> 03:44:12,810
I wanna play it again sometime.

5035
03:44:14,050 --> 03:44:16,110
Maybe with this group or another group.

5036
03:44:16,250 --> 03:44:17,090
Or whatever, whatever, whatever.

5037
03:44:17,950 --> 03:44:18,190
Yeah!

5038
03:44:19,970 --> 03:44:20,890
Otsumito, everybody!

5039
03:44:21,730 --> 03:44:25,050
Wow, my chat froze at the very last second.

5040
03:44:25,190 --> 03:44:25,690
Oh, there it goes.

5041
03:44:28,070 --> 03:44:28,530
Yay!

5042
03:44:29,790 --> 03:44:31,050
Gomintou, thank you!

5043
03:44:31,110 --> 03:44:32,330
Otsumito, Otsumito, everybody!

5044
03:44:32,790 --> 03:44:34,010
Have a great day, have a good night.

5045
03:44:34,230 --> 03:44:36,370
And I'll see you when I see you!

5046
03:44:39,230 --> 03:44:40,630
Next!
