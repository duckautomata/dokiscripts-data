1
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,120
I just started.

2
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,420
Oh my gosh, you guys are paying.

3
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,040
Whoa.

4
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:14,980
OK.

5
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,220
Let me fix the volume.

6
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,820
Hello, testing, testing.

7
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,520
Testing, testing.

8
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,700
Alright.

9
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,920
Guys, the audio...

10
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,480
Oh wait, there's more audio options!

11
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,220
There's more audio options.

12
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,020
Oh wait, there are now?

13
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,280
Oh, nice!

15
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,340
OK.

16
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,680
Why wasn't that on the menu?

17
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,160
Blah, blah.

18
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,020
That's so crazy.

19
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,060
The menu was like three options.

20
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,880
It was.

21
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,880
It honestly was.

22
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,240
Audio, yes, no.

23
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,920
And also, do you want to mute the main menu music?

24
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,180
You could still do that.

25
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,820
The main menu music was really loud.

26
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,840
You could still mute the main menu music.

27
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,860
By the way, for those who don't know, Naima and I are both very sick.

28
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:56,880
We are.

29
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,840
I'm going away from the sickies.

30
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,480
Ew, no!

31
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,020
Get away from me!

32
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,520
No, get away from me!

33
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,960
No, get away from me!

34
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,460
We're just dedicated to our work.

35
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,100
We're going to get photos of Spiderman!

36
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,400
I'm going to kiss you, man.

37
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,080
What is happening?

38
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,980
We just gave you my germs.

39
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,500
What is...

40
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,200
Wait, I can edit?

41
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,660
Oh shit.

42
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,420
I was going to say, let's edit it because I can't tell who's who.

43
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,000
Oh no, I can be this girl.

44
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,320
I know exactly who I want to be.

45
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,540
I know who I...

46
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,220
Here, I'll switch.

47
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,820
Ladies, ladies.

48
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,240
I'll switch.

49
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,340
Get me photos of Spiderman.

50
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,100
You look like a cop.

51
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:38,900
No.

52
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,160
I look like a cop.

53
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,360
You look like a fucking...

54
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,840
Those undercover cops, but they're definitely not undercover.

55
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,940
This one actually looks like, you know when people are like, look, it's Vi, but with Jinx's hair color.

56
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,640
Oh yeah.

57
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,560
The game, is it like laggy?

58
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,380
Not laggy, but like...

59
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,020
It's just unresponsive, which I kind of expected.

60
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,920
Oh, are we conspiracy theorists?

61
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,640
Oh, are we?

62
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,820
What is this?

63
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,380
I mean...

64
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,740
But it's real.

65
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,220
We're going to figure out who shot JFK.

66
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,920
Oh, I can hear a vague echo, do you hear that?

67
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,720
That looks like JFK right there.

68
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,200
I don't think so.

69
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,720
Oh, I do hear it.

70
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,280
We're going to figure it out.

71
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,120
Okay, you're echoing.

72
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,580
Oh, am I echoing?

73
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,640
Yeah, just mildly.

74
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,700
I think I know why.

75
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,240
Okay, it should be better now.

76
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,780
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

77
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,260
Blah, blah, blah.

78
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,800
Yeah, that's better.

79
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,580
Thank you!

80
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,640
Oh my god, it was um...

81
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,180
Wait, is that...

82
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,920
Oh my god, there's planes and everything.

83
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,440
Alright, we need...

84
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,280
Okay, wait, let me check this first.

85
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,740
I like the YouTube red circle.

86
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,600
Plane!

87
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,640
Do you see it?

88
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,900
The city lights.

89
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,340
Do you see it?

90
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,960
Okay, guys, it looks like I'm lagging in and out because I'm tabbing out and in because I'm trying to find Snuffy.

91
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,300
Snuffy has yet to un-private her stream.

92
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,700
Snuffy...

93
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,420
Do you see her?

94
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,700
Wait, no, I do...

95
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,780
No, she's invisible, right?

96
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,480
I don't even see her.

97
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,400
I feel like Ron does that.

98
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,460
Oh, she's called Snum.

99
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:13,660
Snum?

100
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,680
Oh, she's called Snum?

101
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,840
I'll invite her.

102
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:19,860
Snum.

103
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,360
I was like, where is she?

104
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,680
Yeah, I don't know.

105
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,120
I typed S-N-U and I was like, oh, there she is.

106
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,120
And then, like, compulsively hit the F key and then she went.

107
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,840
And I was like, what?

108
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,520
Oh yeah, now she's invisible.

109
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,380
No!

110
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,020
I invited her anyway, maybe I had to let her come in.

111
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,400
Alright, we'll see.

112
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,340
Alright, let me get some cough drops.

113
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,540
Current session is Sloppy Sister Session.

114
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,260
Only take one per day.

115
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,940
Did you really name this the Sloppy Sister Session?

116
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,360
Yeah, I did.

117
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,000
Sloppy Station?

118
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,000
Sloppy Station?

119
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,520
We are from...

120
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,120
We are reporters.

121
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,280
Yeah.

122
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,800
Alright, let's see.

123
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,180
I'll just up everybody.

124
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,180
My audio guy was like, does this game have individual volume sliders for people?

125
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,840
Oh, Snuffy says the game bluescreened her.

126
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,320
What?

127
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,400
That's a good start to the day.

128
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,520
Hey guys, join our Discord here.

129
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,860
Tell them that it bluescreened us.

130
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,360
Hey, you bluescreened us.

131
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,460
Yeah, you bluescreened...

132
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,980
No, actually, don't do that, don't do that.

133
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,000
I think that's, like, a hate rate.

134
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,500
I think that's, like, actually...

135
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,600
I thought you were just telling us, not your chats.

136
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,040
Yeah, no, don't do that, don't do that.

137
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,640
Okay, if you do not say that line, we'll send you.

138
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,900
Dreamer abuses her power.

139
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
What else we got in here?

140
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,940
Wait, there's a store here.

141
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,200
Okay, that means we gotta make big money.

142
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,500
We need a pro camera trap.

143
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,920
God, why is there always a flashlight and a pro flashlight?

144
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,140
It means the flashlight standard is gonna be fucking bad.

145
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,020
There's a window here, but it leads to the locker room.

146
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:06,020
Wait, is this just a higher budget version of that free game that came out after Lethal Company, where you went down into this creepy place and recorded things and then watched it back afterwards?

147
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,400
Content warning, content warning.

148
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,400
Content warning, yeah.

149
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I thought, too.

150
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,780
It looked really, like...

151
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,060
Yeah, it reminds me of that.

152
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,180
I didn't play that.

153
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,900
Darwin Awards.

154
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,060
What's Darwin?

155
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,280
Returns to flirt with death for life.

156
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,800
Oh, multipliers, that's cool.

157
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,180
I'm ready to flirt with anything, alive or dead.

158
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,300
Oh my god, what the fuck is that?

159
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,000
Those are some of the monsters.

160
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,360
Oh, I think that's why it's weird, is...

161
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,820
The run is not hold shift, it's like tap.

162
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,520
Your run looks really stupid, look at the run.

163
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,800
Oh, so... okay.

164
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,420
Says you.

165
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,700
I think there's like stamina.

166
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,040
Wait, what are the other controls?

167
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,880
There's jump.

168
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,100
Oh, there's crouch.

169
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:53,640
What's crouch?

170
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,160
Oh, the crouch is so laggy.

171
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,060
I think... yeah, it's really laggy, yeah.

172
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,020
I think it's not... I think it's toggled, not like... hold down.

173
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,100
Yeah, it is, it's toggled.

174
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,420
Yeah.

175
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,400
Oh, look at it go.

176
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,480
Oh, the press.

177
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,820
Oh yeah.

178
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,200
Oh, wait, wait, these are equipment.

179
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,980
We only have ten pictures.

180
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:16,980
How do you use it?

181
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:18,960
Wait, wait, wait.

182
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,940
Wait a minute, get over here.

183
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,680
Okay.

184
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,200
Get over here.

185
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:22,940
No, no, no.

186
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,400
I'm here, I'm here.

187
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,820
Next to me, next to me.

188
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,660
Oh, next to you.

189
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,820
What's it look like?

190
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,280
It's beautiful.

191
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,500
Oh, you can do...

192
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,860
Oh, wow!

193
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,740
That's what I look like?

194
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,400
Oh my god!

195
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,660
I look like an actual...

196
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,140
I'm sorry, I'm giving Snuffy tech support.

197
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,000
Oh, okay.

198
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,400
Apparently, she bluescreened and now it like crashes every time she boots.

199
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,100
Oh, what?

200
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,900
The game like killed her, so I'm giving my tech support.

201
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,420
This game?

202
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,580
This game?

203
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,420
Alright, guys, here are some pro tips when taking photos.

204
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,620
The higher the angle, the more flattering you look, guys, right here.

205
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,340
Oh, yeah.

206
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,780
Hey, guys, welcome back to my channel.

207
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,340
Hey,

208
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,480
guys, welcome back to my channel.

209
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,240
Today, we're going to be going on some epic, crazy adventures.

210
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,560
My name is PD, Peter Peterson.

211
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,940
This is a private session.

212
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:50,880
This is a collab.

213
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,440
This is a collab party.

214
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,040
What do you mean?

215
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,680
I don't collab with other YouTubers.

216
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,780
Oh, you're solo?

217
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,840
You're flying solo?

218
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,280
Yeah.

219
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,560
Today, we're going to do a crazy challenge.

220
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:10,760
See if I can get a monster to do 20 squats or every squat it does, I'll lose $10,000.

221
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,200
Okay, guys.

222
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,200
Remember to hit that like button.

223
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,060
Yeah, subscribe, subscribe, subscribe.

224
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,820
And get that notification.

225
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,540
Oh, the bell, the bell, the bell.

226
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,180
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

227
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,740
Go jump around while you're in selfie mode.

228
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,320
How am I holding the camera?

229
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,280
I'm just that good.

230
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,060
Hello, everybody.

231
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,000
My name is Doki Bird.

232
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,640
And today, we're going to go see some monsters today.

233
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,140
Oh, I see one right in front of me.

234
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
Whoa, me too.

235
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,820
Oh, my God.

236
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,840
Say cheese.

237
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,960
Oh, there she is.

238
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,600
Right here is what we call...

239
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,680
She's outside her natural habitat right now.

240
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:06,580
Whoa.

241
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,260
Said, I got this, then immediately regrets it.

242
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,460
These are the last known photos of our journalist.

243
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,620
Wait, are these actual people?

244
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,140
Wait, these are actual ads.

245
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:17,940
These are actual photos?

246
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,020
Oh, my God, it is.

247
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,600
Oh, my God, we need to be in this.

248
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,760
Look, this one has them kissing in front of the monster.

249
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,080
Oh, my God.

250
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,940
Wow, Johnny Boy.

251
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,200
Oh, my God, Johnny Boy.

252
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,900
Johnny Boy got some at the end.

253
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,680
Yeah, that could be you, everybody.

254
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,060
The last photo before she died.

255
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,140
These are awesome.

256
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,180
How did he die here?

257
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,340
How did Captain Peter die?

258
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,680
I don't think he died.

259
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,600
I think he's just...

260
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,640
These are all, like, last photos before they died, though.

261
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,020
Oh.

262
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,820
I like this guy's photo here.

263
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,880
This one's good.

264
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,320
He looks so, like, unafraid.

265
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,400
He's ready... He's facing death and he's facing it head on.

266
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,400
With his back.

267
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,100
I think this one is funny, too.

268
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,820
This one...

269
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,700
Like, you know someone else took that photo right here?

270
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,080
Yeah.

271
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,160
He's like, he's not behind us, right?

272
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,600
Wow, is this, like, a spoiler of things?

273
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,260
Oh, my gosh, there's a giant lady.

274
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:19,860
Wait!

275
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,940
Wait, Prissy!

276
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,280
Wait?

277
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,460
What am I doing?

278
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,540
Get in the camera!

279
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,240
Get in the camera!

280
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,580
Yeah, buddy!

281
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,020
Yeah, let's go!

282
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,720
Press 7!

283
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,300
Press 7!

284
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,740
7?

285
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,720
Oh, that's me!

286
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,880
Oh, yeah!

287
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,700
Oh, yeah, that's me!

288
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,640
Wait, what's this one?

289
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,920
Oh, it's like... Oh, wait, what number was that?

290
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,740
What number did you press?

291
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,320
6.

292
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,480
6.

293
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,820
Hey there, buddy.

294
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,000
Wait, wait, do it live.

295
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,700
Do it live.

296
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,880
No, no, no, no.

297
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,380
Your other hand is going up.

298
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,780
What's the other... What's... I think it's 6, right?

299
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,860
This one?

300
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,980
Oh, no, the wrong way.

301
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,940
You gotta be on the other side.

302
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,340
Okay.

303
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,780
Nope.

304
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,740
Doki is a perpetual hover hander.

305
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,960
No, Riz!

306
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,860
No, Riz!

307
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,340
I'm really scared.

308
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,760
Oh, my God.

309
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,620
I'm so close to another woman.

310
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,800
You get points for, like, doing emotes.

311
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,660
In the picture.

312
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,360
Oh, yeah.

313
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,080
What's number 5 for me?

314
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,560
If I download this, is it gonna expose my computer?

315
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,480
Yeah, it's pointing.

316
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,020
Okay, downloaded to desktop folder.

317
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,400
Cool.

318
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,260
She's downloading the photos from the game.

319
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,700
Am I doing... What am I doing?

320
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,280
You could actually download the footage.

321
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,840
Am I doing Gognum's...

322
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,600
Gognum's style.

323
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,720
Like this, like this.

324
00:22:59,720 --> 00:22:59,980
Yeah.

325
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,740
What the... What the hell?

326
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,300
We need a chair.

327
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,740
We need a chair for this.

328
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,420
You're, like, opposite of it.

329
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,720
You're looking at the chair.

330
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,720
You're not sitting in the chair.

331
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,020
Oh, it's like sitting backwards in a chair.

332
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,680
Except it doesn't actually work.

333
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,540
I thought it was Gognum's style.

334
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,740
What's number 2?

335
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,500
You're jiving.

336
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,460
It looks like we're doing the twist.

337
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,180
Let's do the twist.

338
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,740
Hello, I'm Paul.

339
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,980
Hello.

340
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,680
Is that your name?

341
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,880
Hi, I'm Paul.

342
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,940
Hey, Paul.

343
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,020
Hey, everybody.

344
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,580
What's...

345
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,900
What's this one?

346
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,040
Is there one for 9?

347
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,240
She's, like, trying to...

348
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,460
Kill the resolution and stuff on it right now.

349
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,480
I'm going to go and investigate and see how it's going for her if she's live.

350
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:09,940
Okay.

351
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,380
How would she still be live if she blue screened?

352
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,840
Well, she's not blue screened right now.

353
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,600
Oh, okay, okay.

354
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,580
Oh, gosh.

355
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,540
Oh.

356
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,660
Should we put it back?

357
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,520
Drop.

358
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,140
I know.

359
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,960
I'm excited for that one.

360
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,240
Can we, like...

361
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
Get that.

362
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,340
If we're getting spoilers for the things we're going to see, but...

363
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,140
We could go right now.

364
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,220
Nah, we'll wait.

365
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,100
Snap great pictures, then get the F out.

366
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,240
Wait, they put too many...

367
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,020
They put too many stars.

368
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,480
Get the F-U-C-K.

369
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,460
No, F-U-C-K.

370
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,740
Yeah, there's another one.

371
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:03,880
Oh, wait.

372
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,500
Oh, it's the freak out.

373
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,200
Yeah.

374
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,700
Get the freak out.

375
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,340
Oh, no.

376
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,480
Does your thing start lagging when you start running?

377
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,900
Like it starts going...

378
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,820
Like the camera.

379
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,560
No, it's fine for me.

380
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
I mean, I might have the tankier PC.

381
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,600
Said the one...

382
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,100
Said the person who needed to get replaced.

383
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,080
Yeah, but now it's okay.

384
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,780
It crashed like two days ago, but now it's okay.

385
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,440
Okay.

386
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,220
Oh, we have no money.

387
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,620
We can get a trap.

388
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,020
We can get a big backpack.

389
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,580
Okay.

390
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,560
What are you going to do with a helmet?

391
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,520
Are they like...

392
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,020
What are you going to throw rocks at me?

393
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,240
Like...

394
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,220
Are they going to throw rocks at us?

395
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,460
They could.

396
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,080
Or bullets.

397
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,000
I mean, it doesn't look too dangerous.

398
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,800
No, it looks so clean.

399
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:54,900
Wait, is that...

400
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,220
Yeah.

401
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,040
It's like a...

402
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,860
There's like shooting stars.

403
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,600
In the night sky.

404
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,920
Shooting stars.

405
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:02,760
Shooting stars.

406
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,720
I can't believe it.

407
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,460
No.

408
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,960
I don't think...

409
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,120
They're not bullets, right?

410
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,320
No, right?

411
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,760
No.

412
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,800
That's not gunfire.

413
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,120
I do hear an ambulance.

414
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,620
I mean, to be fair, there is no one walking outside.

415
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,660
But it's like...

416
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,040
You know, after a curfew.

417
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,960
Ever since the government instated a nationwide curfew.

418
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,260
You know, this is how it's going to look like now.

419
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,000
I think it's a nice warm ambiance.

420
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:34,980
I like it.

421
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,280
It's kind of smoggy.

422
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,960
It's like, you know...

423
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,860
It's just New York City.

424
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,240
Yeah.

425
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,240
Regular New York City night.

426
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,080
Regular New York City night.

427
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,100
Wasn't...

428
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,500
Wasn't like New York City like red at one point?

429
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,820
Because of like the fires?

430
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,380
Yeah, actually.

431
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,060
That's actually what I was thinking of.

432
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,840
I was like, damn, this kind of reminds me of that.

433
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,680
Oh no, we threw away the newspaper.

434
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,200
We're failures at journalism.

435
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,780
Nobody wants to read our paper.

436
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,600
No, it's because we're starting our career now.

437
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,440
We're going to make it big.

438
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,340
We're going to get the front page news, guys.

439
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,500
Oh yeah, front page news.

440
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,460
Because I decided to go into journalism in 2025.

441
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,460
Oh, why does my thing do that when I run?

442
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,560
Why does it do this?

443
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,300
Oh my God.

444
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,960
Nuffy is still having problems.

445
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,320
I'm trying to help fix it.

446
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:26,760
No!

447
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,860
What's going on?

448
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,380
It might be...

449
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,120
You know the whole thing where Intel CPUs are...

450
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,340
We're like getting really unstable.

451
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

452
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,560
Oh, she stopped Intel?

453
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,160
I'm like...

454
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,280
Yeah, I'm kind of like scanning her chat.

455
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,100
And it's like, oh, oh no.

456
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,340
Oh no.

457
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,240
Oh no.

458
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,120
I think it might be like the degraded CPU thingy.

459
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,740
No.

460
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,440
Oh, she might need to turn it like...

461
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,640
Yeah.

462
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,440
To play headliners?

463
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,980
That's crazy.

464
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,160
Yeah, the headliner is too powerful.

465
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,160
Oh no.

466
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,660
The only time I've ever had to underclock my PC was for Marvel Rivals.

467
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,020
That's crazy.

468
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,630
Why is it so...

469
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,760
Marvel Rivals runs so weird.

470
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,140
Like, no matter what I change, it runs at basically the same frame rate.

471
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,620
Yeah, it's just incredibly tanky in general.

472
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,660
Yeah.

473
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:16,980
Woo!

474
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,560
Is there batteries?

475
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,460
Oh, there's batteries for flashlight, by the way.

476
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,440
I put my phone away.

477
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,880
I mean, my camera away.

478
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,560
Your phone away?

479
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,080
My camera.

480
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,260
Oh, I see it, I see it.

481
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,120
Wait, I wonder if I could take your phone.

482
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,980
Now you're calling it a phone.

483
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,300
Oh, I can!

484
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,500
If I could take your camera, I could take your... Like, I could see your photos.

485
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,920
Wait, do you see it?

486
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,720
Wait, let me see.

487
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,260
Yeah, yeah.

488
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,000
Why is Snuffy Leclerc in this photo?

489
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,380
Head bobbing.

490
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,140
Maybe it's that.

491
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,350
OK, let me try it.

492
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,080
Oh, there's head bobbing?

493
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,640
Apparently.

494
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,300
I think maybe that's what's...

495
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,620
Bless you!

496
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,860
Oh, bless you!

497
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,220
Where's the head bobbing part?

498
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,180
I don't see it.

499
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,000
I don't know, that's what somebody told me.

500
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,260
There's no head bobbing.

501
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,300
I think I got one guide.

502
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,720
I got one guide.

503
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,880
You got one guide.

504
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,460
Yeah, maybe.

505
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,480
Glitch or network lag.

506
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,820
That might be it, I think.

507
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,820
Because everything else is running fine.

508
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,060
Hey there, lady.

509
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,520
Maybe I should have hosted because I'm the most central.

510
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,940
Yeah, you didn't host, everyone.

511
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:38,480
That's not a bad idea.

512
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,780
Honestly, yeah, why am I hosting?

513
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,620
I'm West Coast.

514
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,440
Yeah, you want me to host?

515
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,200
We have plenty of time to switch it up while Snuffy tries to figure this out, so if I would switch it up...

516
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,900
OK, OK.

517
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,080
Get out of my room right now.

518
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,460
OK.

519
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,780
Goodbye, everybody.

520
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,080
Goodbye, everybody.

521
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,640
Thanks for the stream.

522
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,780
This was a lot of fun.

523
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,920
Yeah, everyone.

524
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,160
That was so fun.

525
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,780
Bye, guys.

526
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,180
Alright, guys.

527
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,160
Anyway, I didn't get to say hello.

528
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,280
Welcome to the headliners.

529
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,140
We'll be playing with Doki, Snuffy, hopefully, and Limu.

530
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,320
I'm kind of worried for Snuffy's computer.

531
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,400
This is exactly why I switched from Intel.

532
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,800
OK, so I play and then I...

533
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,200
Oh, let me hide.

534
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:26,580
Hold on.

535
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,240
Let me make sure that...

536
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,700
Actually, let me change one other thing.

537
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:30,700
You know what?

538
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,480
I am gonna go.

539
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,800
I don't see anything about...

540
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,060
Head bobbing.

541
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,680
OK, play, create session just in case so that you guys can't see.

542
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,460
Oh, friends only.

543
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,060
Just kidding.

544
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
You guys can see now.

545
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,600
Session name.

546
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,980
Snuffy sisters.

547
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,560
Welcome back.

548
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,120
Got some jobs for you.

549
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,060
OK, let me tell them that I made it.

550
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,340
Oh, gosh.

551
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,280
Poor Snuffy.

552
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:21,960
No.

553
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,940
Thank you guys for all the superchats and the donos and the gifteds too.

554
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,120
Thank you.

555
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,280
Thank you, thank you.

556
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,560
Sorry, it's hard to say.

557
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,520
In collab.

558
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,600
Want to join from me.

559
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,620
Oh, wait.

560
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,540
Can they join from me?

561
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:58,900
Hello.

562
00:31:59,340 --> 00:31:59,800
Hello.

563
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,380
Oh, you have like three lives too.

564
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,320
What is?

565
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,700
I have three what?

566
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,660
You have three lives.

567
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,480
That's like the little passes, right?

568
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,040
Yeah, I think that's what the passes are, yeah.

569
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,840
Or press pass.

570
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,800
Oh, my God.

571
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,120
Oh, this is already looking so much better.

572
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,860
Oh, it must have been the ping then.

573
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,360
Maybe.

574
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,180
I'm fine though.

575
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,380
On your server.

576
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:26,860
Okay.

577
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,700
I don't know what it was.

578
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,380
Maybe it was like...

579
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,000
Also with Limu connecting.

580
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,660
I don't know.

581
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,540
Maybe.

582
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,760
I don't know actually.

583
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,480
Hello.

584
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,180
Because like for me...

585
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,860
Hello.

586
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Apparently, VTube Studio... What the fuck?

587
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,820
Press, press, press.

588
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,160
What?

589
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,360
I've got like the press badges showing up.

590
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,380
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

591
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,120
I think those are lives.

592
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah, that's why I thought earlier the game was starting.

593
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,000
I was like, oh, my God.

594
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,080
Yeah.

595
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,980
So apparently, it was VTube Studio.

596
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,580
Oh, it was VTube Studios?

597
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,560
I think it was like...

598
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,300
I think it's like her CPU is dying so hard that having both running kind of broke everything.

599
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,160
Oh, my God.

600
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,900
So today was the day she found out her PC is dying.

601
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:14,600
That's...

602
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,180
I think they already did the thing where they under-vaulted it.

603
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,240
It's just not enough anymore or something.

604
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:19,940
I don't know.

605
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,480
No, if you under-vaulted... If you under-clock your PC too much, you start breaking your PC.

606
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,460
Yeah.

607
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,980
So, like, I think she just needs to get a new PC at this point.

608
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,740
I mean, the PC...

609
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,780
Well, I think the X-Series comes out.

610
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,660
That'd be sad.

611
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,920
Rest in peace.

612
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:43,840
Bye.

613
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,260
What was that?

614
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,060
And she got a blue screen.

615
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,500
And her CPU... No, her PC died trying to play Headliners and her CPU fried.

616
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,120
Lyrical genius!

617
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,440
Wait, Lime, do you want to change back to your old outfit?

618
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,100
Oh, right, right, right.

619
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,420
Hold on a second.

620
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,420
The way you run is so funny.

621
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,100
Because I have green hair.

622
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:13,820
Yeah.

623
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,020
Don't be the token woman in the group.

624
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:16,640
I know.

625
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,820
Actually, oh, I'm gonna be this guy.

626
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,180
You're bald.

627
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,880
That's it?

628
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,940
He's like, mhm.

629
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,760
Don't I look like I belong in New York?

630
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,160
Like, I look like Seinfeld.

631
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,040
You look like...

632
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,320
Well, the one thing that's missing is that Seinfeld has a head of hair.

633
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,580
No, his friend.

634
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,200
George.

635
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,540
George Costanza.

636
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,640
Yeah, but he doesn't have glasses.

637
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,080
I've never watched Seinfeld, by the way.

638
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,180
I don't know who George is.

639
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,160
I just know Seinfeld.

640
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,240
Oh my god, I've watched all of Seinfeld.

641
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,020
Damn, what a hag.

642
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,180
I literally watched it like two years ago.

643
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,800
Don't even.

644
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,680
Two years ago.

645
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,740
Is it because you watched the Seinfeld AI shit?

646
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,740
Is that why?

647
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,620
No, I watched Seinfeld before the AI.

648
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,720
And then I watched the AI and was like, whoa, this is so accurate.

649
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,840
Nothing's happening.

650
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

651
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,600
Two years ago.

652
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,460
What's the deal with VTubers?

653
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,540
What's the deal with Snuffy's computer?

654
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,840
I think we've gotten there.

655
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,960
She switched models to a less intensive one on VTube Studio and it might not be alright.

656
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,280
I feel so bad for her.

657
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,400
It's so frustrating when your computer's not working the way it should.

658
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,700
Yeah, I can't believe Death by Headliners.

659
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,780
What a way to go.

660
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,560
Death by Kuso game.

661
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,800
Of all the things to take you out, right?

662
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,440
Of all the things, it has to be a Kuso game.

663
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,720
Oh my god, you found a music player.

664
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,360
Holy shit.

665
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,280
That's right.

666
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,940
Wait, how do you dance again?

667
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,260
It's two.

668
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:10,700
Two.

669
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:10,760
Two.

670
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:17,380
I actually have this whole thing with Path of Exile 2 where that thing will, like, break my computer.

671
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,320
And that sucks.

672
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,540
Nice dancing.

673
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,520
What is your mouth doing when you dance?

674
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,080
Holy shit.

675
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,580
What's your mouth doing?

676
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,620
Oh no.

677
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,500
I keep dancing.

678
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,740
Okay, look at the photo.

679
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,700
Look at the photo.

680
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,660
I'm looking.

681
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,120
I look like I'm creeping on her.

682
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,580
Look at him go.

683
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,860
Look at him go.

684
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,120
No!

685
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,980
Hold on, here you go.

686
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,600
Here you go.

687
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,420
Live, if you want to see the picture.

688
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,660
Yeah, I do.

689
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,040
Out of a gallery.

690
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,780
Oh man, freaky.

691
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,420
There you go.

692
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,840
Man, what a freak.

693
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,840
That's what they call me at the club.

694
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,800
At the club.

695
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,860
Let's go.

696
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,260
Whose jacket?

697
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,680
Whose scarf?

698
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,100
Whoa, whose scarf is that?

699
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,600
Wait, I wonder if there's new photos.

700
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,280
I'm gonna check.

701
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,120
Oh yeah, see if they've changed.

702
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,120
No, they're the same ones.

703
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,500
Maybe it's just, like, a standard set then.

704
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,060
Yeah.

705
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,440
Yeah, maybe it's, like, submitted.

706
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,340
Like, Twitter users submit it and then they change it every so often.

707
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,480
We gotta get on here.

708
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,940
We gotta get on here.

709
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,680
Alright, we gotta get some good photos in.

710
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,040
Yeah, and if we post these, you guys gotta like it so that they notice.

711
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,580
Yeah, yeah, so the devs will add us into the photos.

712
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,220
Yeah.

713
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,270
I wonder if you can change the channels.

714
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,450
Oh, there was a different one earlier.

715
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,450
Maybe...

716
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,070
Oh, see?

717
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,810
Stop laughing at me!

718
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,830
Is it Girls Just Wanna Have Fun?

719
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:20,430
It really is Walmart Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.

720
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:26,290
The phone rings in the middle of the night.

721
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:31,710
My mayor of the town said, I'm fighting for my life.

722
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:36,570
I need someone to take a picture of the kaiju.

723
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,110
The press just wanna have fun.

724
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,350
Oh, the press just wanna have fun.

725
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:53,070
Apparently, taking my invite to this session caused OBS to crash.

726
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:53,590
No!

727
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,120
It's the whole thing that's so cursed for her.

728
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,680
This is so cursed.

729
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,650
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

730
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,850
Oh, no, that's the wrong one.

731
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,690
Which one was it?

732
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,470
Oh, god damn it.

733
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,210
It's one, it's one, it's one.

734
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,230
Oh, it's one?

735
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:21,570
Okay.

736
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,350
Is it working?

737
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:25,610
No.

738
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:26,950
Wait, hold on.

739
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:27,790
Let me see this.

740
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:28,550
Does it... Wait.

741
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:29,830
Which one is it?

742
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,530
Which one is the hover hand?

743
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:32,670
No.

744
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,270
Oh, it's six, I think.

745
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:34,510
Six?

746
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,750
Yeah, yeah, six.

747
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,850
Does it look like I'm cool against the wall?

748
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,650
It does, actually.

749
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,470
I think that's what it's supposed to be, rather than putting your arm around someone.

750
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:44,710
Snub joined!

751
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:46,830
Snub!

752
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,690
Wait, wait, wait.

753
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,430
Oh, my god!

754
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:49,330
Snuffy!

755
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,310
Snuffy!

756
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:51,870
Hello?

757
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,150
Hi, you're here!

758
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:54,990
You're with us!

759
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,570
Oh, my god, it's using the good... Okay, wait, hold on.

760
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,410
We missed you.

761
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,930
I feel... This is wrong.

762
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,370
Are you okay?

763
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,990
What did you have to do to get it working?

764
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,250
What did you do?

765
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:06,290
Naked!

766
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,490
I'm completely naked!

767
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,750
I'm like a flesh streamer!

768
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,250
I'm nothing!

769
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,250
It's just the game!

770
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,450
I can't play with any sort of, like, VTube studio!

771
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,020
I'm like...

772
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,670
Where's my... Where's my beautiful face and, like, quirky traits?

773
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:24,670
You can, like, put your own foogie on the reactive thing on the bottom, so at least you can include yourself there.

774
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,230
Oh, yeah, true.

775
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,450
Now that it finally works.

776
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:26,850
You have to be a YouTuber.

777
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,350
I'm too afraid!

778
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,310
Anything else, like, if I tap it, it's like...

779
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,810
If you tap out, it'll probably break everything.

780
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:31,570
It's like Jenga!

781
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,650
If I move one thing, it's gonna shatter!

782
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,370
You know what's gonna happen?

783
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,310
We're all gonna be, like, super excited.

784
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,550
It's gonna finally be working.

785
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,410
We go into the mission, and you instantly crash.

786
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,030
I'm calling it now.

787
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,070
I'm calling it.

788
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,350
No, no, no, no!

789
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,830
No, no, no!

790
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,350
I believe!

791
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,050
I'm a believer!

792
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,150
I'm a believer!

793
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,850
I'm, like, super, super sorry for, like, all of that.

794
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:54,190
You're fine.

795
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:54,710
No!

796
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,890
I did not expect for it to, like, crash.

797
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,770
It's okay!

798
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,090
Look at us dance!

799
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,730
Look at us dance!

800
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,050
I'm patting your head.

801
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,690
We figured out how to dance, and then we found the copy of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun At Home.

802
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,230
So we're having a really good time.

803
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,570
So there's emotes.

804
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,710
You know, number keys are emotes, by the way.

805
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:11,610
Yeah, one through eight.

806
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,350
Okay, okay, hold on.

807
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,970
Let me get my CD up really quick.

808
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:17,630
Also, there's a girl with blue hair that you can be if you want over here.

809
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,750
Oh, I thought you guys just made your characters.

810
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,910
No, no.

811
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,130
You can introduce yourself over here.

812
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,750
You think I would've made this?

813
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,390
Yes!

814
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:31,410
So that was my first pick, was that was instantly, you made that.

815
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,730
Thank you!

816
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:38,990
Wait, wait, wait.

817
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,730
Lean against the wall so I can take that picture.

818
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,650
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

819
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,150
Wait, uh...

820
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,770
It should be the brick wall, the brick wall.

821
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,530
Yeah, brick wall.

822
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,270
That's where the aesthetic is.

823
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,810
Check me out, check me out.

824
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,350
I'm, like, wistfully looking out the window.

825
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:57,250
Uh, tonight, we're gonna be catching some real monsters.

826
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,770
Wait, don't talk, don't talk when you do it.

827
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:00,050
Okay.

828
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:02,930
Did you get it?

829
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:04,890
I get it.

830
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,370
Your expression.

831
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,460
He's just a chill guy.

832
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,040
This looks like a real...

833
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,540
With a smile.

834
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:22,840
Oh!

835
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,160
Look at this photo.

836
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,840
That took a minute.

837
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,040
It looks too...

838
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,880
It looks too chill.

839
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,480
I can't...

840
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,480
Oh, I gotta drop my camera.

841
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,440
Oh, wait, no, that's my flash.

842
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,520
I'll just drop everything, whatever.

843
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,660
What do you got in there?

844
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,560
Nothing.

845
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:40,980
Okay.

846
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,540
How the fuck do I...

847
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,140
Oh, there you go.

848
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,000
There you go.

849
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,620
My camera has all the real photos.

850
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,780
We can actually toggle music by doing this.

851
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,200
Yeah.

852
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,540
That's all the real photos.

853
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:52,900
Mm.

854
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,500
Mm.

855
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,100
Mm.

856
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:54,640
Mm.

857
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,440
Mm.

858
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:55,800
Mm.

859
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,500
Oh, yeah, I like that one.

860
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,740
I learned it.

861
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,940
Okay, I think I'm good now.

862
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,760
What did we learn?

863
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,280
What did we learn?

864
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:05,740
Teach me.

865
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,600
We've learned...

866
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,700
Over here are the lockers if you wanna change your appearance.

867
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:08,860
You wanna change your appearance?

868
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,540
Yeah, we learned about...

869
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,340
Whoa, whoa.

870
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:11,780
Locker.

871
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:14,980
Oh, yeah.

872
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,220
Oh, oh.

873
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,460
I like your girl hair.

874
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,520
Thank you.

875
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,400
I like yours as well.

876
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,300
I think that's the best one we gotta remember.

877
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,780
I'm just basically like, screw the rules.

878
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,420
I have green hair.

879
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:23,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

880
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,480
For the photos.

881
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:24,880
All right.

882
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:25,800
Woo!

883
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,240
All right, you guys all ready?

884
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:27,760
Oh, yeah.

885
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,300
Step in, Snuffy.

886
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,200
Go get your camera.

887
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,260
Yeah, we gotta get it.

888
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:30,440
Oh, okay.

889
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,580
Did you ever play Content Warning, Snuffy?

890
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,340
Because I feel like this is, like, just modern...

891
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,400
Or, you know, day...

892
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,120
Modern.

893
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,000
This setting is...

894
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,760
Yeah, modern.

895
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,580
Day-to-day content warning.

896
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:41,640
Or, no, no.

897
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,140
Cloverfield content warning.

898
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:43,780
That's what it is.

899
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

900
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,920
That's Cloverfield content warning.

901
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:45,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

902
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,800
I mean, that looks like...

903
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,240
This really looks like Cloverfield.

904
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,660
It's a movie where, like, a big old Godzilla-type thing invades New York.

905
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,160
Snuffy, Snuffy, this looks like...

906
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:53,200
Yeah.

907
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,460
This is basically Cloverfield.

908
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,760
Yeah, it was, like...

909
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,420
Yeah, no, it is.

910
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,260
That's Cloverfield.

911
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,400
Wait, the guy's car or the thing?

912
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,380
The monster.

913
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,220
No, the monster.

914
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,160
The monster.

915
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,860
The monster is Cloverfield.

916
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,680
It had, like, crazy ARG marketing when it first came out.

917
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,100
It was...

918
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,960
What was the name of the drink that was, like, responsible?

919
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,880
Like, there was a drinks company, and they were drilling for the secret ingredient for the drink, and that's how they discovered the monster.

920
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:15,900
What?

921
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,360
What?

922
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,140
The Cloverfield had a drink.

923
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:19,780
I swear to God.

924
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:20,510
Oh, Slusho.

925
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:21,980
Slusho.

926
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,620
Slusho.

927
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:23,700
Slusho.

928
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,880
Yeah, Slusho drinks.

929
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,560
Chat, we're in the natural habitat of hags right now, I think.

930
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,440
As we discuss our favorite movie.

931
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,220
And ARGs.

932
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,000
Fuck you.

933
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:35,820
It was cool.

934
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:36,980
It was cool.

935
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,580
Yeah, let's go get some pictures.

936
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,380
Green doors equals get in.

937
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:45,840
Okay.

938
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,200
Oh, Pequod!

939
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,400
The Slusho ARG.

940
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,180
I just don't like that voice.

941
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:55,920
It fucking hurts.

942
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:56,540
No!

943
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,700
I'm gonna shine a fucking flashlight in your face the whole time.

944
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,460
I swear to God.

945
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,040
Okay.

946
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,960
You guys were alive during the ARG of Cloverfield?

947
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:12,660
Right?

948
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,860
Who's flying?

949
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,460
Pequod.

950
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,280
Oh, where is she?

951
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,200
I found the anomaly.

952
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,940
What do we do?

953
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,460
Hello?

954
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,220
No!

955
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,440
Somebody can't hear me.

956
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,140
I can hear you, I can hear you.

957
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,060
That sucks.

958
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:45,960
I knew it would happen.

959
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,340
We literally looked at each other and I was like, is Snoopy still here?

960
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,360
And then there were only three people in the helicopter.

961
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,700
I was like...

962
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,900
Oh, Snoopy!

963
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,460
I'm so sorry.

964
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,740
I should've like triple-double-extra checked that this was an unplayable game for me.

965
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,700
I'm so sorry.

966
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,280
You wouldn't have thought.

967
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,200
This game looks so casual.

968
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,220
Yeah, it really does.

969
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,260
I've never had a game give me as much trouble as this has.

970
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,780
It's because you're a raccoon.

971
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,400
So Marvel Rivals has hurt us all, I see.

972
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,600
Wait, it shows you're still in the game though.

973
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,960
That's weird.

974
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,720
Can you join mid-session?

975
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,920
Yeah, I'll try that.

976
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:28,980
Why the hell not?

977
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,240
Hell yeah.

978
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,380
Yeah, it shows current session, your name's in there.

979
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:32,820
Snub!

980
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,040
I see you, Snub!

981
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,140
No, Snub!

982
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,760
Where are you, Snub?

983
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,680
Okay, so I tried to join.

984
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,680
It took me to the homepage.

985
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:43,000
The first lobby is Midwest Marijuana Enthusiasts.

986
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,260
Yeah, obviously that is us.

987
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,100
Maybe you invite her back in.

988
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,380
I've been inviting her.

989
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,920
Okay, okay, let me see.

990
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,320
Maybe it manually kicks her or something.

991
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,000
Okay, yeah, let me kick you.

992
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,340
Joining from Limu's invite.

993
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,660
No, it crashes.

994
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,500
Out of memory.

995
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,440
It doesn't let me kick you, you're stuck in the game.

996
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,080
You've been Sword Art Online'd into headliners.

997
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,320
I'm stealing your identity, Mint, and I'm fucking haunting this collab.

998
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:23,080
Oh, I see Snub there.

999
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:34,000
So the options, I guess, are either you bow out, which will make us very sad, or you stop streaming and you play with us and see if it doesn't crash.

1000
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,400
I guess those are the options.

1001
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,300
There's people crying outside, Gus.

1002
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,560
What do you mean people crying?

1003
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,520
If OBS was running, it would still boot up.

1004
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:49,420
This is a persistent issue I've had with my Intel for a while, so I think it's just my computer is at its peak right now.

1005
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,880
Do I need to start a GoFundMe for you to switch to AMD?

1006
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:04,920
I've been working with Ironside, because they're the ones who made this computer, and I've been trying to have them help me fix it, but they need me to flash BIOS and basically restart the entire PC.

1007
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,520
It's just been a long process of, like, I also need to stream.

1008
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,920
That's so frustrating.

1009
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,720
I'm sorry, Snobby.

1010
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,680
No, that's okay.

1011
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,360
I am so sorry, you guys.

1012
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,720
If you want to do it, you guys should live it up.

1013
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,760
I hope you have a great game and everything.

1014
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,560
I'm super sorry.

1015
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,140
We'll play this again together when we're all four again.

1016
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,620
Your head keeps twisting.

1017
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,880
Yeah, you keep doing this.

1018
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,520
You know, we did bring you guys on the next one.

1019
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,740
Look at Snobby, they can do some Bond Hunters.

1020
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:44,420
Yeah!

1021
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,860
Back into the fray.

1022
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,380
Bye, Snobby!

1023
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,380
Bye, Snobby!

1024
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,240
Okay, I'm gonna go back into the game.

1025
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,180
Why on earth can we 360 our heads?

1026
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,940
Alright, we also have a time limit.

1027
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,260
We have six minutes left.

1028
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,040
We have six minutes to capture footage.

1029
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,620
Guys, there was a lot of sounds around me.

1030
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:11,880
I'm really scared.

1031
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,900
There was a guy in his underwear that ran past us at the very start.

1032
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,720
I didn't want to disrupt the heartfelt conversation with Snobby, but he fucking sprinted past us in his undies.

1033
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,720
Yo, maybe that was the monster.

1034
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,860
Oh, I hear something.

1035
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,160
Where?

1036
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,280
No, I don't think we gotta take a picture.

1037
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,740
Hello, survivor.

1038
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,300
You have a witness account?

1039
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,260
She's not interested in your shit.

1040
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,200
Did she just scream at me?

1041
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,020
What did you see over there?

1042
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,160
What did you see?

1043
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,600
Please, please.

1044
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,280
Hey, hey sir.

1045
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,080
Sir, can I get just one sentence?

1046
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,900
How do you feel about this whole situation?

1047
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,340
Did you have monster insurance on your car?

1048
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,720
What was that?

1049
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,580
Oh yeah!

1050
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:06,700
What?

1051
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:07,740
Oh my god.

1052
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,580
Pose in front of him.

1053
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,900
Here, I'll pose in front.

1054
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:14,760
Where is he?

1055
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,080
Oh, there he is.

1056
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,240
Hey buddy.

1057
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,060
Oh, I was still alive!

1058
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,740
I didn't think I was still alive after that.

1059
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,380
I hope they got a good picture.

1060
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,960
Dude, she's in fucking pieces on the floor.

1061
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,780
Go down there, you coward!

1062
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,160
Get closer, Doki!

1063
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,240
Get closer.

1064
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,120
What is this?

1065
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,620
What is this?

1066
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,760
Wait, get my camera!

1067
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,420
Oh, that's me.

1068
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,020
I should have selfied in front of him.

1069
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:09,700
Aw man.

1070
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,600
She got absolutely murdered in 0.2 seconds.

1071
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,040
Get the camera, get my camera!

1072
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,120
There's another dog monster.

1073
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,220
Oh, there's a dude in his underwear.

1074
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,380
There he is!

1075
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,220
There's a stripper.

1076
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,100
Ok, we need to get her camera because she had photos too.

1077
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,300
What the hell was that?

1078
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,660
Why is there a leg flying?

1079
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:32,920
I threw that.

1080
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,180
Oh damn, she's taking my body.

1081
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,280
I got the real deal.

1082
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,240
The guy with his underwear is just running around by the cars now.

1083
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,620
Wait, wait, we need to take a picture of that.

1084
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,660
He's below us.

1085
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,480
Here he is.

1086
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:45,660
Ok.

1087
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,580
She just knocked that car over.

1088
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,840
She's got superhuman strength.

1089
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,060
Streaking at this hour.

1090
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,340
This is the best time to streak.

1091
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,880
If it's the apocalypse, I'd streak too.

1092
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:01,680
Scared?

1093
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:05,800
Go to the dog.

1094
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,940
How do we get out of here?

1095
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,160
I think we just go back to the helicopter.

1096
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,560
You know what, I feel like we did a good job.

1097
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:12,900
What?

1098
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,700
Yeah, I got some cool pictures.

1099
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,440
And she's like here with us.

1100
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,580
Do you think we get a reward for bringing back her torso?

1101
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,460
Probably.

1102
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,940
Oh my god, there I am.

1103
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,480
Let's go.

1104
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,180
Everyone's here.

1105
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:29,480
Ok.

1106
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,940
I only have three...

1107
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,500
I still have three press cards.

1108
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,300
Hello,

1109
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,360
I'm back.

1110
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,720
I told you.

1111
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,380
We made it.

1112
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,160
We can rebuild here.

1113
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,880
We're checking the results on the TV.

1114
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,420
Check the results.

1115
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,520
Let's see.

1116
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:57,800
Results.

1117
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:58,900
Here we go.

1118
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,220
Yeah, that's me.

1119
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,520
Why is it just me?

1120
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,600
I got every good photo.

1121
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,940
Where am I?

1122
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,120
I was just used for your content.

1123
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:26,440
What do you mean?

1124
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,220
There you are.

1125
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,240
I literally see you.

1126
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:28,680
You're right.

1127
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,820
Very good.

1128
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,800
Good job, everybody.

1129
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:34,780
It's too good.

1130
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,620
I'm downloading my favorite photos.

1131
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,860
Did we just take the top photo, I guess?

1132
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,640
From everything, which would be this one.

1133
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,260
Oh no, we can just look at them.

1134
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,340
Yeah, you just look at them.

1135
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,820
Dog alien and then you dying.

1136
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,440
You get money for blood.

1137
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,480
We can buy more stuff now, like a pro camera so we can take more photos.

1138
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,520
You can do that, I have no money.

1139
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,480
Ma 'am, what are you doing?

1140
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,800
And there's me dancing next to your body part.

1141
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,200
We need to convert the points into photos.

1142
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,780
I'm sorry, into money, which I guess we can only do at the end.

1143
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:17,360
Okay, so we have two more press badges, so we can do this two more times.

1144
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,980
Got you.

1145
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,460
So we need to reach 1500 by...

1146
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,020
Okay, got you.

1147
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,820
Makes sense.

1148
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,420
Green doors equal get in.

1149
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,800
Ma'am, why didn't you emote next to the dog?

1150
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,840
We could have gotten more points.

1151
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,200
He came at me!

1152
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,320
I'm sorry!

1153
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,180
He came at me and then I was just like...

1154
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:38,680
Oh, I'm dead.

1155
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,580
I don't even think you have a degree in journalism.

1156
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:45,180
Well, then he attacked me again, so he can get you twice, I think.

1157
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,300
Wait, how do we get the plane to start?

1158
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:51,820
I think it won't because Snuffy is still technically in the...

1159
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,580
Oh no, she's gone.

1160
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,660
Okay.

1161
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:55,480
Hey!

1162
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,440
Oh, I need to equip a camera.

1163
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,160
Oh, you have a camera.

1164
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:01,880
It's you.

1165
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,280
Wait, there's no cameras here.

1166
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:04,640
Oh.

1167
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,420
How do you...

1168
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,740
You have to buy a camera.

1169
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,700
I don't have any money!

1170
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,920
Oh, it's free.

1171
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,640
I don't get my flashlight back, though.

1172
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,900
Thanks for grabbing that instead of, you know...

1173
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,300
my body.

1174
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,580
Oh, that's the thanks I get after rebuilding you?

1175
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,740
Alright, I see.

1176
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,700
I literally rebuilt you from nothing.

1177
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,740
From just a torso.

1178
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,200
Okay, let's go!

1179
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,060
We're off to see...

1180
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,820
Everything in the city!

1181
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:43,500
Yeah!

1182
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,620
Danger level one?

1183
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,500
Oh my gosh, this is gonna be a piece of cake.

1184
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,900
I died on a danger level one.

1185
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,730
No, that was probably a danger level like...

1186
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,260
What?!

1187
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:03,840
I got you all those photos because I went in!

1188
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:08,080
I went in and got those photos for you!

1189
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,780
Oh, money is shared, by the way.

1190
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,400
What are we looking for?

1191
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,260
Is he still there?

1192
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,020
No, there's no dog.

1193
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,100
Dog creature is not here this time.

1194
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,600
Alright, YOLO, let's go in.

1195
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,160
Then we're free to go down.

1196
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,460
Oh, you're going this way?

1197
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:23,720
Okay.

1198
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,040
Gotta find something exciting!

1199
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,700
That's a beautiful door!

1200
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,140
Green doors mean we can go in!

1201
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,680
Green doors!

1202
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,800
Let's go in.

1203
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,140
It's that blue light over there.

1204
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:40,600
Hold on.

1205
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,760
What is that?

1206
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,480
I hear something.

1207
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,760
Green doors, go in!

1208
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,440
Green doors, go in.

1209
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,060
I'm opening.

1210
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:57,500
Oh.

1211
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:58,940
Hello?

1212
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:00,960
Hi!

1213
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:04,900
Okay.

1214
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,760
There's a little...

1215
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,080
What was that?

1216
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:13,720
What was that?

1217
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,660
Look at the ground!

1218
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,500
Hello?

1219
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,360
What was that?

1220
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,940
Did you not see the thing running towards us?

1221
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,700
There was a little...

1222
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,220
No!

1223
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,580
There was a little thing that ran towards us!

1224
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,080
Everybody saw it!

1225
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,200
Are you sure?

1226
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,940
Alright, let's go in then.

1227
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,240
I'm in.

1228
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,300
There's pizza!

1229
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,500
Possibly.

1230
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,700
Do you see that?

1231
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,040
The ghostly essence?

1232
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:51,680
Yeah.

1233
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,520
What the hell was that?

1234
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:57,880
Did you see that?

1235
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,440
Are you hiding?

1236
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,560
Wait, can we all be in here?

1237
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,360
Hello?

1238
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,360
Someone is going to get fucking eaten.

1239
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,520
Okay, we're good.

1240
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,560
I have a feeling this stalker isn't good.

1241
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,180
Yeah, I feel like he's going to come back.

1242
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,220
No, I'm fine in here.

1243
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,740
Be brave then!

1244
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,560
I got a picture of him!

1245
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,240
Hold on, I'm going to emote on him.

1246
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,440
Is he coming back?

1247
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,200
I don't know.

1248
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:35,940
He's not here.

1249
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,040
Alright, come on Doki!

1250
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,320
Be brave!

1251
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,620
Alright, I got it.

1252
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,360
I'm going to go by myself.

1253
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:41,940
We're going.

1254
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,660
What the hell?

1255
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,940
What just happened?

1256
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,100
He's a hiding survivor.

1257
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,260
Let's go follow him.

1258
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,640
Why is this game so scary?

1259
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,500
Because it's a horror game.

1260
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:58,820
Oh, hey buddy.

1261
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,820
What do you have to say?

1262
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,280
Can you move?

1263
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,200
He's actually blocking us from moving.

1264
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,880
Wait, I'm actually stuck.

1265
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:08,720
Oh, there we go.

1266
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,000
Who is this?

1267
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,220
He's a hiding survivor.

1268
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,360
He's here to hide.

1269
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,020
Every time I talk in game discord, I can see on my second monitor.

1270
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,420
It's like, you're currently muted.

1271
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,960
Oh, I hate that.

1272
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,480
Oh my god, look at him, look at him.

1273
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:25,880
Oh, look, look, look!

1274
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,540
Doki, there's like a trap here.

1275
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,460
Oh, shit!

1276
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,920
It's a constant warning trap!

1277
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:33,900
Yeah!

1278
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,300
You don't have good photos, right?

1279
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,060
Hold on.

1280
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,220
Wow, look at this mom!

1281
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:49,620
What the hell?

1282
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,680
Is this guy actually following us?

1283
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,220
What do you want?

1284
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,280
I mean, he's probably shit scared.

1285
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,540
We should trick him into the trap so we can take a picture of him eating.

1286
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,360
Oh, true, true, true.

1287
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,760
Poor awful people.

1288
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:03,740
Hey, hey!

1289
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,120
Hey, hey!

1290
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,240
I think he's fixated on you.

1291
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:14,100
Hey, kid, come on.

1292
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,760
Let's go somewhere safe.

1293
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,940
Over here.

1294
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,360
Oh, here he comes, here he comes!

1295
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:21,500
Get your cameras ready!

1296
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,700
Come on, come on!

1297
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:24,700
Come on, come on!

1298
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,360
Yeah!

1299
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,300
Good job!

1300
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,820
It's going all Technicolor outside.

1301
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:36,860
That's probably bad.

1302
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:37,860
Technicolor?

1303
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,480
It kind of went all purple out there.

1304
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,940
It's just acid rain.

1305
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,260
Oh, no, it's the lighting system in here.

1306
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,000
Okay, we're fine.

1307
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,660
I think we should go back.

1308
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,440
We have a lot of good photos now, right?

1309
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,140
Oh, I see it, I see it.

1310
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,640
What is it?

1311
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,540
It's in the other room.

1312
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,040
I saw red eyes running around.

1313
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,580
Oh, it's a soccer.

1314
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,640
Wait, how did we get back?

1315
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,940
I don't remember where we came from.

1316
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:03,660
Uh, this way.

1317
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,060
Up the stairs?

1318
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,540
We're actually leaving?

1319
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,480
I think so.

1320
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,240
No, it's not up the stairs.

1321
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,660
I don't think so.

1322
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,920
It was through here.

1323
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,500
Oh, I can't see anything.

1324
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,060
Wait, I don't have a...

1325
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:21,020
Here, here, here.

1326
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:21,400
I got you.

1327
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,300
Oh, yeah, it was here, because there's the locker.

1328
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,540
And that's where the photo is.

1329
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,160
Yeah, and it's straight through here.

1330
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,760
I think we should go back.

1331
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,160
I think we have all the photos we need.

1332
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,620
I still have six photos I can take.

1333
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:37,680
I'm about halfway through mine, so it depends on whether or not we want to risk dying.

1334
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,020
I have two.

1335
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,400
Yeah, I don't want to risk dying.

1336
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,920
We have some sick-ass photos.

1337
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,660
There might be some shit in the square as well.

1338
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:43,680
Oh, okay, okay.

1339
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,220
Alright, let's get these first.

1340
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:51,290
Team safe.

1341
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:52,250
There's no dogs here.

1342
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:54,510
Oh, yes, there's something in the square.

1343
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,030
Oh, there's two dogs.

1344
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:57,530
Is that a not-dog?

1345
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:00,230
That's three enemies right there.

1346
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:01,610
Can you zoom?

1347
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:03,370
Look at them go.

1348
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:04,450
Wait, is this like...

1349
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:10,110
Is this like Lethal Company, where the longer you're out, the more things spawn?

1350
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:13,090
I think this is RNG, I'm pretty sure.

1351
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:16,070
Oh god, can you actually make that?

1352
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:18,150
How to tell?

1353
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,390
I can't get up there.

1354
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,450
Guys, don't come over here, you'll get stuck, JK.

1355
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,270
Oh, okay.

1356
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,090
Well, what do we do?

1357
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:28,410
Oh, just crouch jump it, Mint.

1358
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:28,970
Oh.

1359
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:31,510
It's just kind of finicky because it's laggy.

1360
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,290
How do you crouch jump?

1361
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:36,270
Jump and then hit control as you're in the air.

1362
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,050
It lifts your legs up.

1363
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,430
Yeah, but then how am I stuck here?

1364
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:44,030
Oh, it might just be fiddly.

1365
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,230
I think Toki might be dying also.

1366
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:48,630
Oh, yeah, no, they're chasing her.

1367
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,050
Great, great, great.

1368
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:50,930
Take a photo, take a photo.

1369
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:57,550
I don't like that sound.

1370
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:01,070
Hey, what's up?

1371
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,150
I'm coming.

1372
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:08,650
I'm making my way.

1373
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:09,750
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1374
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:11,630
There's a monster below us.

1375
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:13,150
To our right.

1376
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:13,970
What is it?

1377
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,390
So we gotta book it, we gotta book it.

1378
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:16,390
He's like right to the right.

1379
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:17,650
Okay, where?

1380
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:20,450
I should've taken a picture of the guy.

1381
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:20,830
Where?

1382
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:21,650
We're gonna go.

1383
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,750
Alright, three, two, one.

1384
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:26,030
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1385
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:30,550
I'm booking him, I'm running as fast as I can.

1386
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,730
Did you send her down there to die?

1387
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:34,350
Nah, she made it.

1388
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:34,910
Where is it?

1389
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:35,830
I don't even know what she's seeing.

1390
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:38,370
I don't see what she saw.

1391
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:40,470
Yeah, she's hallucinating for real.

1392
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:42,930
We only have two minutes.

1393
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:44,290
What the?

1394
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:46,190
What was that?

1395
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:46,770
Oh, I see him.

1396
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:48,230
Do you see him by the post there?

1397
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:49,310
Oh yeah!

1398
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:50,750
He's coming back.

1399
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:51,190
Uh-oh.

1400
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:55,450
Doki says, guys, there's a monster right in front of me.

1401
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:56,730
That sounds bad.

1402
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:00,410
I can hear her shouting for help.

1403
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:01,730
Should we stop ignoring her maybe?

1404
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:03,190
I don't know if we'll make it.

1405
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:04,930
Oh, he just left.

1406
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,210
Okay, I think we can go.

1407
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:06,870
I can hear her screaming.

1408
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:08,710
We should get into the helicopter.

1409
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:12,890
Go, go, go!

1410
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:14,990
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

1411
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:17,450
Oh my God, he's right there.

1412
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,750
Turn around, turn around, take a photo, take a photo of him!

1413
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:20,430
Turn around, take a photo!

1414
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:22,670
He's far away!

1415
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:23,510
Yeah!

1416
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:29,450
I could just hear you in the distance like, guys...

1417
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:30,910
This is not a game for Doki.

1418
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:32,690
She's too much of a coward.

1419
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:32,870
She's too much of a coward.

1420
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,740
This is not a game for you, Doki.

1421
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,220
Yeah, I was getting photos.

1422
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,600
I was taking photos, what are you talking about?

1423
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,580
I got a great photo while you were running.

1424
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,220
I'm gonna have the best photo today.

1425
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:54,660
Number one!

1426
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,920
Wait, what the hell is that?

1427
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,420
Oh no, that's number five!

1428
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,960
He was in front of me as I was taking a photo, it was really funny.

1429
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:02,780
Number four!

1430
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,020
Number three!

1431
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,820
Yes, my photo!

1432
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:08,260
Number two!

1433
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,320
What is that?

1434
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,580
Why did I get a single one?

1435
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,120
Get in the locker!

1436
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:18,580
That's right.

1437
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,940
That's right, it was me.

1438
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:22,380
Objective complete.

1439
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,400
I even baited that guy into the trap.

1440
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,560
Wait, you didn't get a single photo at all?

1441
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:31,140
What?

1442
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,840
We can afford exactly one thing.

1443
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,400
Do you want a pro camera?

1444
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,360
Or do you want...

1445
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,920
Maybe a helmet?

1446
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,940
What is a helmet for?

1447
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:48,820
I guess we can give a helmet to Mint.

1448
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,740
And then use her as bait warrior.

1449
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,760
Hold on, it's plus 25% health.

1450
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,480
Then the trap will block monsters.

1451
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,220
We can buy Mint a flashlight.

1452
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,300
Give me one.

1453
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,800
Yeah, you have a flashlight, it's okay.

1454
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,760
There's a zoom camera too.

1455
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,420
For Doki, because she doesn't like to get close to anything.

1456
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:15,140
True, but there's also a camera that lets you take 15 pictures.

1457
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:17,520
I got the best photo in that game.

1458
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,540
And I was very close to you guys.

1459
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:21,800
Do you want the 15 pictures camera?

1460
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:22,820
Or the zoom camera?

1461
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,680
Or the flash camera?

1462
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,720
I feel like the zoom camera would be better, right?

1463
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:27,800
Oh...

1464
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,420
You get less score for it.

1465
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,620
Or the flashy camera?

1466
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,260
Might be good, because we don't have to rely on the flashlight.

1467
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:35,060
True, true.

1468
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,100
The pro camera has the best pictures.

1469
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,160
For what it's worth, so you get more score.

1470
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,980
So we should get the pro camera then.

1471
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,540
I think they add the pro camera then, so we can get more money.

1472
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,120
Added to your stock, apparently.

1473
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:48,080
I'll use the bathroom.

1474
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,000
Do you want the pro camera?

1475
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,180
No, you can have it.

1476
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,340
You're gonna get the best shot of all of us now.

1477
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,040
That's the plan.

1478
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,680
You guys are so close to me right now.

1479
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,220
Do you want the pro camera?

1480
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:08,300
While basically licking my nose?

1481
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,560
You want the pro camera?

1482
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,820
I really like your eyeliner.

1483
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:15,600
How it goes around your pores.

1484
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,380
It goes around your whole eyes.

1485
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:29,560
I haven't had the use of both of my nostrils since, I don't know, Friday.

1486
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,620
You're like the color of your hair for real.

1487
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,600
We're not the sloppy sisters today.

1488
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,960
You guys are the snotty sisters.

1489
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,840
It's true, it's true.

1490
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:47,820
Welcome back.

1491
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,760
Did you wash your hands?

1492
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,120
Yeah, I did.

1493
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,600
Who has it?

1494
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:57,680
Mint has it because Mint has clearly got a great track record for taking good pictures.

1495
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,360
Let's see again.

1496
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,440
I'm sorry, this is the front line news?

1497
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,580
I'm sorry, this is the front news?

1498
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,080
What is this photo?

1499
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:09,360
There's nothing in there!

1500
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:16,120
It looks like you're in a compromising picture with that fucking monster, if I'm gonna be honest.

1501
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:22,380
Breaking news, I've uncovered a secret relationship.

1502
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:27,160
Oh wait, the monster is in that picture, I see him barely.

1503
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,400
Yeah, he's literally right there next to you.

1504
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,780
I am in a really compromising...

1505
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:36,740
I have a scandal right there.

1506
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:39,640
Extra, extra, read all about it.

1507
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,980
Mint got all of her pants down.

1508
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,140
It's not a scandal if I welcome it.

1509
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:51,400
Oh yeah, I had relations with that monster and I'd have them again.

1510
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:55,820
Let's go!

1511
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:01,600
Do you think we'll get the scarier map now because we completed it?

1512
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,580
Oh yeah, probably.

1513
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:04,600
We have a higher thing now too.

1514
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,140
Yeah, all we have in the world is a hundred dollars.

1515
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,920
Mint's definitely not gonna die with the pro camera.

1516
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,000
We have to sacrifice ourselves.

1517
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,620
I won't die with the pro camera.

1518
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,340
Oh, it's two now!

1519
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:16,660
Bless you!

1520
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:20,360
I didn't know if that would come through on the loading screen.

1521
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,780
Alright, team.

1522
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:26,680
Alright, team.

1523
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,640
What are we looking for?

1524
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:29,160
Don't die.

1525
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:31,660
Who are you saying that to?

1526
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:32,320
Mint or me?

1527
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:33,920
I'll try...

1528
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,260
Mostly Mint, but also you because I care.

1529
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:39,040
But if I get a great photo in death, isn't that the best thing?

1530
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,960
If you get a great photo in death, we have to get your camera back.

1531
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,520
Yeah, take the camera, take the camera.

1532
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:44,780
Look, look, look!

1533
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,300
There's another way up to the rooftops here.

1534
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:52,260
Oh my god, your legs!

1535
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:56,920
My eyes are up here.

1536
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:59,400
Ladder, ladder, ladder.

1537
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:03,320
You gotta say ladder, ladder, ladder when you climb, it's the rule.

1538
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:05,380
Oh, the buildings are collapsing.

1539
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,180
Oh, do we have to parkour here?

1540
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:07,940
Oh god.

1541
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:09,700
I'm gonna do it.

1542
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:10,220
Parkour!

1543
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:12,900
Made it.

1544
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:14,580
Watch this.

1545
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:15,920
Made it.

1546
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:18,860
Parkour.

1547
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:21,440
We're the best journalists ever?

1548
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:22,140
Wow.

1549
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,920
Oh, there's a ladder over here too, so...

1550
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,120
Oh, there's a light!

1551
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:28,660
There's a green light!

1552
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,860
Maybe there's doors below us.

1553
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:33,420
Can we... Is there damage?

1554
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,280
Fall damage?

1555
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,320
Yeah, do a flip.

1556
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,080
Do a flip, Mint.

1557
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:38,980
How do you safely use these fucking ladders?

1558
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,460
Mint, how do I go down the ladder?

1559
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:49,720
You just press down!

1560
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,640
I'm kinda stuck on the ladder.

1561
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:56,860
No, you're not.

1562
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,420
This is very dangerous.

1563
01:10:58,660 --> 01:10:59,340
Holy shit.

1564
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,900
I'm taking your flashlight, Doki.

1565
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:01,800
Thank you.

1566
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,120
I'll miss her.

1567
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,480
I won't.

1568
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,600
Do you wanna go into the deli and grocery or whatever this building is?

1569
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,700
Yeah, I was gonna say there's a second one.

1570
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,620
Yeah, let's go into the grocery.

1571
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,320
Ooh, that dog sounds real close.

1572
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,200
Okay, let's go.

1573
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:24,520
Okay, you have the pro camera, so if it gets dark, I will light the scene up for you.

1574
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:24,780
Alright.

1575
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,360
That elevator is smoking.

1576
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:29,480
Yeah?

1577
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:31,200
Yeah, it is.

1578
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:32,940
There's also a room here.

1579
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:34,740
Was that you opening it?

1580
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:35,360
Oh my god!

1581
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,060
Ooh, this one!

1582
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:36,620
This one's it, Eddy!

1583
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:37,580
Huh?

1584
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,500
Careful, look behind you!

1585
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,400
There's some annihilation shit going on.

1586
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:41,800
Oh, wow!

1587
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:45,140
Alien tentacles?

1588
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,420
Hold on, I'm gonna get a selfie with that.

1589
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,160
Do you want me to pose for it?

1590
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:53,380
If you want, yeah.

1591
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,220
I can hear a monster.

1592
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:56,760
Me too.

1593
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:03,780
This guy is plus two skulls dangerous, so...

1594
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,900
Ooh, what was that?

1595
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:07,360
Hello?

1596
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,040
Evil.

1597
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:09,480
Hello?

1598
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,680
Ooh, this place is pretty spooky.

1599
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:16,660
A little.

1600
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:17,340
A little.

1601
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:17,960
Doki, you good?

1602
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:18,900
I like the echoing.

1603
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:19,980
I know, me too.

1604
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:20,560
The ambiance is good.

1605
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,860
Wait, Doki, you're good.

1606
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,420
You saw her torso outside.

1607
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:24,480
I'm asking her.

1608
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,780
I know she's watching right now.

1609
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,160
I'm being haunted by the spirit of Doki.

1610
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,120
I can hear her.

1611
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,900
Stop taking my shtick, man.

1612
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,240
Is there nothing in here?

1613
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,520
No, there's nothing in here.

1614
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,200
Let me go the other way.

1615
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,640
I guess we can check the security cameras.

1616
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,060
Hold on.

1617
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:45,880
Do you hear him?

1618
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,640
What did you let him do?

1619
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,980
I took a picture!

1620
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,160
Where's your camera?

1621
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:55,860
I took a picture.

1622
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,360
You're alive.

1623
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,140
You have no leg.

1624
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:58,560
Let's go.

1625
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,400
You are missing a leg.

1626
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,260
Let's go.

1627
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,220
I'm 50% health.

1628
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,020
The camera!

1629
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,080
The camera!

1630
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,100
I got some great footage.

1631
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:22,420
This thing ate my legs.

1632
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:22,940
It came out.

1633
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,580
There was no way I could go anywhere.

1634
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,560
What do you mean?

1635
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:31,940
Slap the table.

1636
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:35,520
You can do that?

1637
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:43,820
Wait, what do you mean slap the table?

1638
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,080
What are you talking about?

1639
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,700
You made a loud thump noise.

1640
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,620
I don't know.

1641
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,840
You thought it was the game, but it was me.

1642
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:55,260
It was me, Dio!

1643
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,540
It was me, Tokiola!

1644
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:04,020
Did she get the camera?

1645
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:04,980
Look at that, Mit.

1646
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,500
You died with the pro camera.

1647
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,080
Yeah, but I didn't die immediately, so...

1648
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,640
You got the theory out.

1649
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,400
Nobody was willing to take the risk but me.

1650
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,180
I got some great footage.

1651
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,040
What cause?

1652
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:22,900
There was no...

1653
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,180
I'm gonna die going down the ladder.

1654
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,380
It's gonna be so fucking embarrassing.

1655
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:31,060
No, it's not.

1656
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,580
It's gonna be my little alien photo.

1657
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:36,560
She made it.

1658
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:37,860
I know.

1659
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,540
I was scared for a second.

1660
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:46,600
There's still a lot of time, but I guess because we're all dead, you know...

1661
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,620
Uh-oh, what's that sound?

1662
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,580
Is there something down there?

1663
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:56,560
Crawling?

1664
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,860
Oh, there's a guy over there.

1665
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,120
No, she needs to take a picture.

1666
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:04,440
Turn around, live!

1667
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,860
There's a big guy.

1668
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:10,520
It's true.

1669
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,540
Who's reading this paper anyway?

1670
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,180
She got the camera, right?

1671
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:21,680
Yeah, we got the camera.

1672
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:22,280
It's good, guys.

1673
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:22,680
We're good.

1674
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,760
Wait, that still counts as my photo, right?

1675
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:35,280
I mean, it's like... it's an important thing.

1676
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:36,240
I took the photo.

1677
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:42,400
Let's see if it counts.

1678
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:51,480
I got his little feet.

1679
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,140
Oh, that's me!

1680
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,640
Oh, that's you, don't you?

1681
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,440
That's you before you died.

1682
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,840
Yeah, I actually took that.

1683
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,980
Thank you, thank you.

1684
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,720
Oh, that's crazy.

1685
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,640
Yeah, level 2?

1686
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,380
I wanna know where the big monster is.

1687
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,740
You saw the big monster photos?

1688
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:35,820
He was persistent, though.

1689
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:37,160
That was scary.

1690
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:43,300
Okay, now that I know how hard it is to take photos, these photos are actually really, really good.

1691
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:44,440
I know, right?

1692
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:45,400
Oh my god.

1693
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,780
Like, this one is so epic.

1694
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,060
The one in front of the crotch.

1695
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,720
Like, these are really good.

1696
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:55,840
Yeah, these are actually really good.

1697
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:57,800
This one looks like he's running away.

1698
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,120
Yeah, the selfie ones are really hard.

1699
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:04,180
Wait, someone said you should be able to pick up all dropped cameras.

1700
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:04,740
Oh, really?

1701
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,120
Oh, really?

1702
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,740
Okay, I threw mine for you.

1703
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,400
But I didn't know if I could actually not.

1704
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:10,740
But it's free.

1705
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,200
It's free to get another one.

1706
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:13,340
Scandal.

1707
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,300
You can cover the scandal between a drugless and alien.

1708
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,980
You're obsessed with this photo.

1709
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,920
Stop being jealous of my love life, huh?

1710
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:25,220
Okay?

1711
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:28,780
It's a pretty good photo, I'm not gonna lie.

1712
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:30,220
Are you guys ready?

1713
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:31,980
On my way.

1714
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:32,620
I'm ready.

1715
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,480
Apparently, the big monsters appear in the last minute.

1716
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,100
So we should just chill?

1717
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,820
So if we chill by the helicopter, we should be good.

1718
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,160
Zinky zoogle.

1719
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:46,960
What the hell?

1720
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,660
We just stay until the last minute, then.

1721
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:54,080
Yeah, if we chill by the helicopter, we should be good.

1722
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,160
Live life on the edge.

1723
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,220
Oh, you hear that?

1724
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:02,280
I hear something going...

1725
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:04,420
I didn't hear it.

1726
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,220
Oh, I see a green light.

1727
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,460
Have we been there before?

1728
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:10,360
That green light?

1729
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,180
We got a different way because we didn't go up to the roof immediately.

1730
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,080
Oh, true.

1731
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:17,740
Wait, no, this is the same way to the same place.

1732
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,360
Oh, we never went forward.

1733
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,360
Oh my god, lady.

1734
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,960
She's just like on a casual jog.

1735
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,680
We could go this way and go into that main building.

1736
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:28,660
We didn't go there last time.

1737
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:29,480
We didn't go into the main building.

1738
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:31,820
What could go wrong?

1739
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:32,600
Exactly, guys.

1740
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,400
What could go wrong?

1741
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,320
Helicopter on the right there is where you turned into a pancake.

1742
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:37,640
That's me.

1743
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:38,500
That's where I was.

1744
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,440
That's where you were.

1745
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,900
Oh, so there's a whole different section over there that we could go up eventually.

1746
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:43,620
That's cool.

1747
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,040
Yeah, we go to the side, right?

1748
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:46,600
Right here?

1749
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,100
Oh, no, we went in that one last time.

1750
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:51,260
Yeah, well, you guys went there last time.

1751
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:51,720
I was dead.

1752
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:52,880
Well, you know, some of us.

1753
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,460
Oh, no, it's the same building.

1754
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:56,660
What?

1755
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:57,720
It is the same building.

1756
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,600
Two doors, same building.

1757
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,380
That's weird.

1758
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,140
Oh, wait, no, the benches are different.

1759
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:03,900
The fuck?

1760
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,140
No, different building.

1761
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:08,240
Oh, there's some monster bloody and stuff in here.

1762
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:09,920
Oh, goopy.

1763
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,740
Wait, pose next to her, pose next to her.

1764
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:15,700
Emo over you.

1765
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:21,460
Oh, there's something in here.

1766
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,280
There's something in here.

1767
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,100
Did something just open the door?

1768
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:26,020
Hello?

1769
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,340
Oh, I saw it.

1770
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,600
A little thing just ran by.

1771
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:29,360
Hello?

1772
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,500
Is it that fucking bat creature again?

1773
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:32,020
I swear to God.

1774
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:32,980
I swear to God.

1775
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:33,920
It's a little baby.

1776
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,140
It's a little cat with a baby thing.

1777
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:37,100
It just ran through that doorway.

1778
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:38,540
A little baby?

1779
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:40,140
A little baby?

1780
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:40,920
Can we kick the baby?

1781
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,260
Go kick the baby, Doki, see what happens.

1782
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,320
Yeah, do it.

1783
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:45,160
Where'd he go?

1784
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,220
I'm scared of a little baby.

1785
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:48,960
Why is a baby two skulls?

1786
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,740
I couldn't possibly imagine why.

1787
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,420
You should definitely go find out.

1788
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:55,240
Where is he?

1789
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,540
Guys, where's the little baby, guys?

1790
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,560
It's right behind me.

1791
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:02,960
Oh, I see what you did there.

1792
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:05,240
Little baby.

1793
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,340
She didn't notice.

1794
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,440
No, I know she didn't.

1795
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,340
She lacks critical information.

1796
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:14,340
I'm not a baby.

1797
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:17,620
What's this?

1798
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,780
What is that?

1799
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:19,380
Nothing.

1800
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:20,460
Is it a breaker box?

1801
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,220
Doesn't do nothing.

1802
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,740
Is this going to be one of those games like Lethal Company kind of where if you find a monster, you're basically just dead?

1803
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,680
I know.

1804
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,360
I think that's what the traps are for.

1805
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,380
Oh, bloody!

1806
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:33,720
Jesus Christ.

1807
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,400
Alright, guys, do a pose.

1808
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:37,700
I'm not letting you get the best photo.

1809
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,480
You do a pose.

1810
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,000
Okay, fine.

1811
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:41,700
Hello.

1812
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:42,360
Whoa!

1813
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,220
We got it, we got it.

1814
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:47,160
There's a...

1815
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:49,620
This looks like a pool next to it.

1816
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,240
Wait, wait, wait.

1817
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:53,060
Oh.

1818
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:55,580
Wait, do it again, do it again.

1819
01:20:58,660 --> 01:20:59,600
It's too good.

1820
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,260
I'm trying not to waste my stamina.

1821
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:09,580
I'm like, trying to keep the doors closed behind us so that we hear if something's coming up behind us.

1822
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,080
Oh, that's a good idea.

1823
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:11,660
You're so smart.

1824
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,860
That's why she lived and we died.

1825
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:14,420
I know.

1826
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:18,240
I mean, you died because you jumped off a fucking building, but yeah, okay.

1827
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,540
I mean, that's exactly why I'm not smart enough.

1828
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,640
This room is huge.

1829
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:25,580
Wait, there's more.

1830
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,300
There's more Annihilation stuff over there.

1831
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:27,820
Where?

1832
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:29,940
I thought it looked like Annihilation.

1833
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:31,240
Annihilation?

1834
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,100
It's in our life.

1835
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,100
It's a movie.

1836
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:37,940
It's a movie where you go into this world and then you get absorbed into it.

1837
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:38,140
Ew!

1838
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:44,220
It's about a prism that instead of refracting light, it refracts DNA.

1839
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:45,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1840
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,380
You look like you're kind of pissing on it, not gonna lie.

1841
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:53,820
Where is a little baby?

1842
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:54,300
Is that weird?

1843
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:57,440
What was that?

1844
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,460
It's the radio.

1845
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:00,240
It's a radio broadcast.

1846
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:03,860
That's freaky.

1847
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,540
Oh wow, we're at the news station.

1848
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:12,560
We should see if there's a way out of this building, but not like having to go all the way back.

1849
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
It's gonna take forever.

1850
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,420
It's a little spooky, not gonna lie.

1851
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:18,580
It is a little spooky.

1852
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,700
What happens if you stand on it?

1853
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:21,660
Don't try it.

1854
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:22,660
Probably nothing good.

1855
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,980
Alright guys, are you ready?

1856
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,180
Are you doing that again?

1857
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,800
Wait, we can be the news now.

1858
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,420
Oh my god, you're right!

1859
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:31,500
Wait.

1860
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,440
My fellow American.

1861
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:36,840
What?

1862
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,080
What?

1863
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:38,560
Oh!

1864
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:48,670
Ran so fast!

1865
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:50,450
I got a cool photo though!

1866
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:51,570
And you kept your leg!

1867
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:52,670
Yeah.

1868
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:55,010
I hear it.

1869
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:56,250
I hear it.

1870
01:22:57,390 --> 01:23:00,110
I'm out of battery on my flashlight, just a heads up.

1871
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:01,130
You're out of battery?

1872
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:01,570
Uh oh.

1873
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:03,370
Yeah, uh oh.

1874
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:05,690
Wait, that's not good.

1875
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:06,550
The baby's back.

1876
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:08,370
Where's the baby?

1877
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,230
I don't know, but I can hear him.

1878
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:12,050
New York is under attack.

1879
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,170
We should probably get away.

1880
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:15,450
I think so too.

1881
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:18,510
Yeah, I don't think a steady is a good idea.

1882
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:20,210
No, it's probably not.

1883
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,730
Alright, let's leave it.

1884
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:24,570
I'm watching your back, I'm watching your back.

1885
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:26,190
Thanks very much.

1886
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:27,750
Oh, I'm so fucking dead, it's so dark.

1887
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:29,650
Oh gosh.

1888
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:32,930
We used the camera for the night vision.

1889
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:35,690
There's goop on the floor.

1890
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,230
Wait, that's a trap, isn't it?

1891
01:23:37,650 --> 01:23:38,130
It could be.

1892
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:40,450
We don't have a survivor though to test it.

1893
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:44,170
I mean, we have three survivors right here.

1894
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:46,590
Excuse me, I'm a journalist.

1895
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:47,710
Oh wait, this is a dead end.

1896
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:50,890
Lethal company ass looking fucking car.

1897
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:51,070
I know!

1898
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:52,950
I wonder if these are randomly...

1899
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:53,910
Wait, this is also a dead end.

1900
01:23:54,770 --> 01:23:55,930
This place sucks.

1901
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:59,230
We could try and book it out the way we came.

1902
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:00,190
What about the left side?

1903
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:01,750
Oh, there's a bed over here.

1904
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:06,290
These doors are open.

1905
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:08,610
Oh, what's this?

1906
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:12,190
Oh wait, this is I think where we came from.

1907
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:20,340
I'm coming.

1908
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:22,220
Oh, hello.

1909
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,340
I'm literally right here.

1910
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:27,600
Goodbye.

1911
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:29,140
Alright.

1912
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:30,680
There's gonna be doggies.

1913
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:38,460
I hate when I leave a room, I spawn inside someone's fucking head and it scares me because I see your eyeballs.

1914
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:41,240
Is that a dude with a gun?

1915
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:42,320
That's a dude with a gun.

1916
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:43,860
There's a man with a bazooka.

1917
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:45,640
Big monster!

1918
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:47,460
He's here!

1919
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:55,330
How do we get the shot?

1920
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:56,050
Oh my god.

1921
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:00,590
Should we go?

1922
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,220
Look at that guy!

1923
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,700
Come on military man, do your job!

1924
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,580
There's like a small guy at his feet too.

1925
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,120
We

1926
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,850
gotta get her...

1927
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:35,250
We need to get her camera, yeah.

1928
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:36,410
Oh my god, it's so loud.

1929
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:39,430
Alright, I'm going for it.

1930
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:40,790
I'm running for it.

1931
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:41,450
Oh you got it?

1932
01:25:41,490 --> 01:25:41,790
Ok nice.

1933
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:43,450
Run, run, run.

1934
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:53,450
Oh god, I'm out of stamina!

1935
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:58,010
Are you alive?

1936
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:05,510
I like how the helicopter pilot is totally fine here with the doors open and everything.

1937
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:07,190
Oh we're fine too.

1938
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:08,070
It's fine.

1939
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:10,750
That wasn't the last minute.

1940
01:26:13,650 --> 01:26:14,330
Yeah!

1941
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:20,210
Ok, ok.

1942
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:25,830
I have a pro camera, I'm like, you know...

1943
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:30,090
I was out of footage!

1944
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:35,010
Look at him, he's so cute.

1945
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:37,570
Wow, he's so cute.

1946
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:39,790
Oh yeah, miss pro camera.

1947
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:42,190
You got his ass.

1948
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:44,310
The picture of the ass got more points.

1949
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:45,670
That one's still good.

1950
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:56,120
That guy was a lot of...

1951
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:56,680
Nice!

1952
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,320
Should we even like wait for the small guys?

1953
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,120
All the pictures of the big...

1954
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,160
Like all the best photos were of the big guys.

1955
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,080
Yeah, I feel like we should just wait for the Darwin award.

1956
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,440
Wait for the helicopter until they show up.

1957
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,900
Here, someone else can use the pro camera if you want.

1958
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:12,940
Oh, we can actually buy another one if you want to.

1959
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:16,000
I can get a pro flashlight instead, maybe.

1960
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:17,000
Oh yeah, maybe.

1961
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:18,420
Oh, there we go.

1962
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:19,200
Scared me.

1963
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:21,640
I will get a pro flashlight this time then.

1964
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:22,180
Nice.

1965
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:23,140
Is this the pro camera?

1966
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:24,600
That's me.

1967
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:27,260
Guys, look, there I am, next to the dinosaur.

1968
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,120
Do we need another flashlight?

1969
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:30,560
We can take another flashlight.

1970
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:31,940
No, I don't think you're in this one.

1971
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:36,960
Yeah, I'm in... No, not in the one that won, but I was second place.

1972
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:39,720
There you go, pro flashlight obtained.

1973
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,460
I was in this one, look.

1974
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:43,560
Oh yeah, that's you.

1975
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:44,420
Flashlighter.

1976
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:46,040
Flashlighter!

1977
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:47,980
Yeah, he has got the picture!

1978
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:51,420
Okay.

1979
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,480
There's some more flashlights there so we can all have one.

1980
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:54,760
Yeah!

1981
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,660
Noki, did you get a flashlight?

1982
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:58,760
Oh yeah, I got it.

1983
01:27:58,920 --> 01:27:59,340
Hell yeah.

1984
01:27:59,500 --> 01:27:59,860
Alright.

1985
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:01,060
Alright, let's go.

1986
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,660
Let's go get some big guys.

1987
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:04,960
Let's get some good photos.

1988
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,600
Alright, so we just gotta live until one minute or something.

1989
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:09,000
Or two minutes?

1990
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:10,060
He showed up in the two minute mark.

1991
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,960
Yeah, it wasn't one minute left.

1992
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,260
It was more time than that.

1993
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:17,000
The monster's stomach.

1994
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,480
The more photos we get though, the better we do.

1995
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,440
So it's still worth getting the others because we got 5000 points which included all the other photos.

1996
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:23,660
Oh, true.

1997
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,420
I feel like the big monsters show up like here.

1998
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:28,140
So we can't be in this area.

1999
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:29,440
You've come so far.

2000
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:33,000
If we just stand here waiting for the monster, it will just obliterate us.

2001
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:33,560
That's true.

2002
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:35,100
We shouldn't be like, that's what's gonna happen.

2003
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:35,880
That's true.

2004
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:38,320
Cool.

2005
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:40,700
Spooky.

2006
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:41,680
Spooky music.

2007
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:44,160
I like the lanterns.

2008
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,260
I feel like peeking through other people's windows.

2009
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:48,760
Don't take photos in there.

2010
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,740
Dude, did you take a picture?

2011
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,280
Is someone changing?

2012
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:56,440
Wow.

2013
01:28:56,780 --> 01:29:01,340
I bet you when the monster shows up, you could use this ladder to get a really good shot.

2014
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:04,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2015
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,740
We'll get pose in front of it.

2016
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:09,140
That's how they get the poses, like staring at the monster all epic.

2017
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,080
It's like a movie poster.

2018
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:12,220
What am I stuck on?

2019
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:13,660
Oh, there's a panorama.

2020
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:14,620
Oh, it's a mall.

2021
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:16,020
I wanna go to the mall.

2022
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:19,240
Let's all go to the mall tonight.

2023
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,040
Alright, let's go.

2024
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:25,360
I'll provide flashlight services first and so you guys don't waste yours.

2025
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:26,420
Okay, are you sure?

2026
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:27,000
Alright.

2027
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:27,760
Wait, what's this?

2028
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,440
You can do flashlight after.

2029
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:32,200
What is that?

2030
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,460
I think those are just lights going in the dark.

2031
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:35,020
Did you hear that?

2032
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,020
Oh, there's a big thing above us on the left part there.

2033
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:41,320
I hear him.

2034
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:42,680
Think you're a monster.

2035
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:44,700
I hear him.

2036
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,120
Where did he go, lad?

2037
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,000
You're like the senior reporter.

2038
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:52,420
Ew, I hear him again.

2039
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:53,680
The one with the biggest flashlight.

2040
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:54,280
You guys not hear him?

2041
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,480
I think he's behind us.

2042
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:56,680
He's like right in here.

2043
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:57,100
Is he?

2044
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:57,340
No.

2045
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:58,680
No.

2046
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:59,780
He's like...

2047
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:01,860
No, I think we're hearing our own footsteps.

2048
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,220
No, I'm hearing...

2049
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:03,720
No, no, no.

2050
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:04,800
I'm definitely hearing him.

2051
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:08,240
I think he's underneath us.

2052
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,580
Oh, maybe under...

2053
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:11,480
Under where?

2054
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:14,680
Hello?

2055
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:17,840
Hello?

2056
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:18,700
Are you a monster?

2057
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:21,920
He is a monster.

2058
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:25,980
This photo is art.

2059
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,380
Oh, I thought...

2060
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:30,140
He looks like he's sucking on his fingers.

2061
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,720
The text is just literally pineapple?

2062
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,220
There's nothing in there.

2063
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:37,180
That is a dead end.

2064
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:39,440
I think it's like...

2065
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,140
Yeah, is it procedurally generated?

2066
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:42,720
Because there's lots of stupid dead ends.

2067
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:43,620
I think that's it.

2068
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:47,160
I was thinking that earlier in the last one.

2069
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:48,680
I mean, that's for replayability.

2070
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:50,720
There, he's down there!

2071
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,060
Oh, there, across.

2072
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:52,700
Do you see it?

2073
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:53,560
What the heck was that?

2074
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,080
It just vibrated out of existence.

2075
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,400
Yeah, I just saw that too.

2076
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:57,040
Yeah, I saw that.

2077
01:30:57,140 --> 01:30:58,040
I couldn't even take a photo.

2078
01:30:58,220 --> 01:30:58,780
I was like, what?

2079
01:30:58,940 --> 01:30:59,760
And then it disappeared.

2080
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:03,240
Oh, there's something in that room over there too.

2081
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,360
Something just went past the camera.

2082
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:06,860
Oh, I hear him.

2083
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:08,520
That's fucking loud.

2084
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,080
Simple.

2085
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:12,620
No, I didn't get a picture.

2086
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:14,080
Any points for that?

2087
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,180
You go as a gerbil, gerbil.

2088
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,480
There's a door here if you wanna go in.

2089
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:21,780
Oh, there's a little baby thing as well.

2090
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:22,520
It's like a rat.

2091
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:23,460
I saw a rat.

2092
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:24,140
Baby rat.

2093
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,380
How do you see all these babies?

2094
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:27,800
I've never seen the babies.

2095
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:29,700
You don't wanna go in the place where the rat is?

2096
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,360
We're going this way?

2097
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:30,600
Alright.

2098
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,460
Oh, you wanna go in there?

2099
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:34,360
I'm fine with that.

2100
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,020
You can go in there.

2101
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,860
There was another place though where there was a little baby rat thing.

2102
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,540
Oh, I thought I heard growling.

2103
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,180
I think this is the same place.

2104
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:42,040
Oh, there's a survivor.

2105
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,720
Oh my god, he scared the heck out of...

2106
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,700
Oh, I think he just died.

2107
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:45,560
Nevermind, he tripped.

2108
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:46,440
No, he's spinning.

2109
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:46,940
He's spinning.

2110
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:48,560
You good, buddy?

2111
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:49,520
He's doing a little spin.

2112
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:51,720
You good up, my guy?

2113
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,160
What's this?

2114
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:54,060
Oh, wanna get rich?

2115
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:54,920
You don't wanna follow us.

2116
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:56,020
We won't take you to die.

2117
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:57,900
It says we can get rich going this way.

2118
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:59,820
I think this just goes around in a circle.

2119
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:00,420
Oh, does it?

2120
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:01,380
No, pizza.

2121
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:03,140
Pizza?

2122
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:04,880
There's another door here.

2123
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:07,020
Maybe it does go in a circle.

2124
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:09,040
Oh, he is following us.

2125
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,180
Oh, break room.

2126
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,380
Wait, oh, what's going on in here?

2127
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:14,100
Nevermind.

2128
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:16,280
This goes back around to the start.

2129
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,420
Yeah, we're at the start again.

2130
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,720
This is where the monster was earlier.

2131
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:20,500
I hear him.

2132
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:21,800
Oh, he's right here.

2133
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:22,960
He's right there behind the door.

2134
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:24,520
I'm gonna open it.

2135
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:25,400
Does anybody want...

2136
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,260
Oh, here, I'll pose.

2137
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,680
Isn't that the creature that took your leg out?

2138
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:30,580
It might be.

2139
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,820
Oh, the spinny Cthulhu thing is out here.

2140
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:35,460
Did you get the photo?

2141
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:36,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2142
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:37,320
I got it, I got it.

2143
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:37,740
Nice, nice, nice.

2144
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,560
It looks like a D&D beholder.

2145
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,100
He's really right there.

2146
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,400
He's gonna take your leg out.

2147
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,100
Open the door.

2148
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:46,520
I take the photo and then we close the door.

2149
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:47,420
Okay.

2150
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:48,960
Okay.

2151
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:50,020
I'll put the light on.

2152
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:51,240
Here, tell me...

2153
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,180
Oh, open the door.

2154
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:52,500
Okay.

2155
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:54,400
Alright.

2156
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:57,140
3, 2, 1.

2157
01:32:58,700 --> 01:32:59,920
Oh, shit.

2158
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:01,700
Ouch, ouch.

2159
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:03,940
Am I okay?

2160
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:04,560
I'm okay.

2161
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:06,760
Where is he?

2162
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:08,600
Where'd he go?

2163
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:09,240
I don't know where he went.

2164
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:10,500
Yeah, just shut the door.

2165
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:13,580
This guy doesn't trust us anymore.

2166
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:18,020
I'm good.

2167
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:18,880
Don't worry about it.

2168
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:20,180
The baby right?

2169
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,020
Don't worry about it.

2170
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:21,640
Holy shit.

2171
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:22,620
Don't worry about him.

2172
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:23,700
Don't worry about him.

2173
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:25,760
Don't worry about him.

2174
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:26,520
Don't worry about him.

2175
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:27,520
It's okay.

2176
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:28,220
Are we leaving?

2177
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:29,840
The lawnmower.

2178
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,740
Holy moly.

2179
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,500
What do I look like?

2180
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:35,680
Oh, you're missing most of your...

2181
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:36,360
Oh, the big guy is here.

2182
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:37,200
The big guy is here.

2183
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,140
I'm almost...

2184
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:43,160
I'm already dead, guys.

2185
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:43,980
I'm already dead.

2186
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,020
Get a picture of me with him.

2187
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:57,070
I'm here.

2188
01:33:58,490 --> 01:33:59,590
Wait, is Doki dead?

2189
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:01,210
There's actually a doorway here inside.

2190
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:02,510
Like a cafe or something.

2191
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:02,990
Oh, wow.

2192
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:06,690
Is Doki dead?

2193
01:34:07,010 --> 01:34:08,550
I don't know where she went, actually.

2194
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:10,650
I don't see her, like...

2195
01:34:10,650 --> 01:34:12,590
Oh, he pissed.

2196
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:13,190
I'm leaving.

2197
01:34:13,830 --> 01:34:15,130
We should go inside or something.

2198
01:34:17,790 --> 01:34:19,050
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

2199
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:24,650
Oh, wait, this is the same building again.

2200
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:25,770
This feels very...

2201
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:26,530
Oh, there's something on the left.

2202
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:27,570
There's something on the left.

2203
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:30,950
This feels very Lethal Company, like in the...

2204
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:31,450
generation.

2205
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:32,450
Oh, God.

2206
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:34,230
We may need to leave.

2207
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:34,730
I think so.

2208
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:35,230
Let's go.

2209
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:38,610
Let's go through the back streets and get away from the big guy.

2210
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:40,630
Oh, God.

2211
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:41,970
Like, turn right here, I guess?

2212
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:43,470
He...

2213
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:44,270
Yeah.

2214
01:34:46,410 --> 01:34:47,390
There should be...

2215
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:48,770
I wonder if Doki's okay.

2216
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:50,250
I'm okay.

2217
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:51,050
Oh, there's...

2218
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:52,110
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

2219
01:34:58,820 --> 01:34:59,720
You're alright.

2220
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:01,280
Oh, God.

2221
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:04,200
Run, run, run, run, run, run!

2222
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:10,520
Get

2223
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:20,220
my camera, please!

2224
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:20,820
Live!

2225
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:22,900
Live!

2226
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:24,860
Get my camera, please!

2227
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:26,380
I got some good shots!

2228
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:32,780
I never even got to see what I look like.

2229
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,760
I think Doki's still alive.

2230
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:38,220
Yeah.

2231
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:42,400
Oh, maybe not for long.

2232
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,420
Oh, my God.

2233
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:46,520
Get my camera!

2234
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,060
It's right there!

2235
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:50,760
Get my camera, please!

2236
01:35:58,790 --> 01:36:00,470
Of course she wouldn't.

2237
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:02,470
It's under the car!

2238
01:36:03,490 --> 01:36:05,030
It's under the car!

2239
01:36:06,030 --> 01:36:06,430
It's under the car!

2240
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:08,350
That sucks.

2241
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:08,830
No!

2242
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:09,870
Hold on.

2243
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:13,610
It's under the car.

2244
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:16,730
Oh, thank you, Ghost of Mint.

2245
01:36:18,990 --> 01:36:19,950
Oh, I see it.

2246
01:36:20,170 --> 01:36:21,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2247
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:22,750
This sucks for me.

2248
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:23,550
This sucks for me.

2249
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:24,110
She's got it.

2250
01:36:24,110 --> 01:36:24,650
Oh, motherfucker!

2251
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:25,690
I'm good.

2252
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:26,610
She's got this.

2253
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:27,910
She's got this.

2254
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:32,410
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

2255
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:32,910
Don't die!

2256
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:33,470
Don't die!

2257
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:34,090
Go, go,

2258
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:40,910
go!

2259
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:41,910
Ghost of Mint!

2260
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:43,650
Hey, what's up?

2261
01:36:44,450 --> 01:36:44,950
Oh, my God.

2262
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:45,670
That was...

2263
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:46,310
You're crazy.

2264
01:36:47,370 --> 01:36:48,650
You don't have an arm.

2265
01:36:49,390 --> 01:36:49,750
No!

2266
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:52,050
What happened to you?

2267
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:53,710
That's just how the game is.

2268
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:55,930
Sometimes you lose an arm.

2269
01:36:56,570 --> 01:36:57,910
Sometimes you lose it all.

2270
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:00,010
That's just the name of the game.

2271
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:03,850
Dang it!

2272
01:37:03,910 --> 01:37:05,310
That guy got me on the ladder.

2273
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:06,150
I was like...

2274
01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:07,670
Oh, I wonder if he'll be able to attack you.

2275
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:09,570
I was wondering because you were right behind me.

2276
01:37:09,630 --> 01:37:10,510
Yeah, he did get...

2277
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:11,390
I was climbing up.

2278
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:11,710
How did you die?

2279
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:12,750
What?

2280
01:37:13,690 --> 01:37:14,590
How did you die?

2281
01:37:14,830 --> 01:37:15,710
Mint got eaten by a dog.

2282
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:16,470
No, the big guy.

2283
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:17,410
Oh, you got eaten by the dog.

2284
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:18,470
No, the big guy.

2285
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:19,350
The big guy got me.

2286
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:20,790
Oh, the big guy got you on the ladder?

2287
01:37:20,890 --> 01:37:21,370
That sucks.

2288
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:21,750
Oh, whoops.

2289
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:22,090
Don't skip.

2290
01:37:23,870 --> 01:37:25,110
Oh, there's your photo.

2291
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:26,090
Look at his little dog.

2292
01:37:27,370 --> 01:37:28,170
Oh, that's good!

2293
01:37:28,210 --> 01:37:28,690
Oh, my God!

2294
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:30,690
That was the dog eating my ass.

2295
01:37:30,810 --> 01:37:31,750
That's so good!

2296
01:37:31,890 --> 01:37:32,290
What the hell?

2297
01:37:32,290 --> 01:37:32,910
Oh, my God!

2298
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:34,730
What the fuck?

2299
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:37,130
Damn, that one's so scary.

2300
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:38,810
That's like a true apocalyptic photo.

2301
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:44,990
When he chomped you.

2302
01:37:45,370 --> 01:37:46,350
I went over.

2303
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:48,390
Yeah, baby.

2304
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:50,530
Oh, yeah.

2305
01:37:50,610 --> 01:37:51,450
I still survived.

2306
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:54,250
I survived that guy twice and I survived the baby.

2307
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:57,110
I like this one, too.

2308
01:37:57,150 --> 01:38:00,610
The rat just like ran towards you and didn't even stop.

2309
01:38:00,730 --> 01:38:02,530
He just took your leg out as he went.

2310
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:04,290
He smelled my blood.

2311
01:38:04,530 --> 01:38:05,530
He smelled my blood.

2312
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:06,770
Oh, my...

2313
01:38:06,770 --> 01:38:09,510
I wish I could have shown you guys.

2314
01:38:09,830 --> 01:38:11,430
I wish it caught on camera.

2315
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:14,370
You got a selfie with the big guy!

2316
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:15,650
Oh, my God.

2317
01:38:15,650 --> 01:38:16,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2318
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:17,930
Wait, did it even count?

2319
01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:19,710
Unfortunately, it didn't register as being with him.

2320
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:20,770
No, but it sucked.

2321
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:22,030
No, you got robbed.

2322
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:23,350
I did.

2323
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:24,050
Oh, my God.

2324
01:38:24,230 --> 01:38:27,530
This was supposed to be a photo with a rat right through you.

2325
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:30,110
Yo, this was the rat mowing you down.

2326
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:33,710
It was so fast, I didn't capture the moment.

2327
01:38:35,790 --> 01:38:38,190
Look at... I look like I'm really angry at you.

2328
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:39,390
I'm like side-eyeing.

2329
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:41,910
Are you sure I should do that?

2330
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:43,790
I love this.

2331
01:38:45,770 --> 01:38:46,210
Alright.

2332
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:48,490
We don't have money yet, so...

2333
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:49,650
This is when I was peeping into people's houses.

2334
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:51,750
Oh, you really did take a photo.

2335
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:52,130
Okay.

2336
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:54,790
Alright, your turn with the pro camera.

2337
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:55,810
Oh, God.

2338
01:38:55,890 --> 01:38:57,330
I don't know if I can handle this responsibility.

2339
01:38:57,690 --> 01:38:59,190
It can be the flashlight if you want.

2340
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:00,370
Yeah, take the flashlight.

2341
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:00,770
Okay.

2342
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:03,310
Alright.

2343
01:39:03,950 --> 01:39:04,110
Okay.

2344
01:39:04,330 --> 01:39:04,650
Alright.

2345
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:06,810
Another day on the job.

2346
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:08,230
Days.

2347
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:10,390
Oh, do we have a standard flashlight?

2348
01:39:10,510 --> 01:39:11,210
Oh, no, you guys.

2349
01:39:11,330 --> 01:39:11,870
I do, I do.

2350
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:12,650
I have one.

2351
01:39:12,850 --> 01:39:13,650
Alright, let's go.

2352
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:14,650
Yeah, I got...

2353
01:39:14,650 --> 01:39:15,530
Oh, I didn't have one before.

2354
01:39:15,610 --> 01:39:16,210
Oh, no, I did.

2355
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:16,970
Yeah, I got eaten.

2356
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:17,690
You did.

2357
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:18,490
I didn't get it though.

2358
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:19,550
I was too busy getting your camera.

2359
01:39:19,670 --> 01:39:21,610
No, that's more important, I'd say.

2360
01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:25,890
There's a duplicate mechanic.

2361
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:27,890
So, the same-ish object.

2362
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:28,910
We're all professionals here.

2363
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:30,590
We are.

2364
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:30,630
We are.

2365
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:31,650
Professionals.

2366
01:39:32,330 --> 01:39:36,310
I knew my journalism degree would come in handy.

2367
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:39,370
I don't have a journalism degree.

2368
01:39:40,330 --> 01:39:40,630
I know.

2369
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:42,190
As soon as we're here.

2370
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:45,230
Who is reading this newspaper?

2371
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:47,190
Who's still alive to be reading this?

2372
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:49,090
I wonder what the blue light means.

2373
01:39:49,210 --> 01:39:51,910
I feel like it has to be important, but it hasn't told us anything about it yet.

2374
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:55,750
Well, I feel like now that the internet is down and everything, you know, this is like literally...

2375
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:59,690
literally like the only thing to read now.

2376
01:39:59,690 --> 01:40:00,650
Oh, true.

2377
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:06,890
I feel like, yeah, I'm pretty sure these monsters have taken down all of the internet.

2378
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:09,250
The 5G's.

2379
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:10,610
5G's.

2380
01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:13,230
The 5G rays that's turning the front.

2381
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:16,190
Even if the world ends, we got you covered.

2382
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:17,510
BS insurance.

2383
01:40:19,090 --> 01:40:20,490
We are professionals.

2384
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:23,410
Which way do you want to go?

2385
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:25,070
There's a building behind us and a building in front.

2386
01:40:25,070 --> 01:40:25,970
Oh, we didn't go to that building.

2387
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:26,910
We didn't go to that building.

2388
01:40:26,910 --> 01:40:29,870
Very briefly, but not long enough, so we can go look.

2389
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:31,790
I don't think there's really a difference.

2390
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:33,010
I'm gonna be honest.

2391
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:35,510
No, I think it's all like randomly generated.

2392
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:38,010
Don't go crypto.

2393
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:41,490
Well, this is different.

2394
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:42,870
Oh, okay, a little bit, yeah.

2395
01:40:43,050 --> 01:40:43,770
Wanna get rich?

2396
01:40:45,070 --> 01:40:45,310
Sure.

2397
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:46,930
Hello.

2398
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:48,070
Hello.

2399
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:49,890
No growls yet.

2400
01:40:49,890 --> 01:40:50,890
We're here to get rich.

2401
01:40:52,370 --> 01:40:55,870
I forgot I had the pro camera, so one of my photos is just some dude running down the street.

2402
01:40:56,910 --> 01:40:56,990
Stop!

2403
01:40:59,850 --> 01:41:00,710
I am scared.

2404
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:02,410
Oh my god, that scared me.

2405
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:03,190
Oh, it's the news station.

2406
01:41:03,210 --> 01:41:04,250
It's the news station.

2407
01:41:05,690 --> 01:41:06,050
God.

2408
01:41:06,830 --> 01:41:07,130
Okay.

2409
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:08,330
I am scared.

2410
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:09,870
It's really dark in here.

2411
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:11,330
Oh, hey, there's his TV.

2412
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:13,350
Security.

2413
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:16,510
I wonder if it ever actually shows anything useful.

2414
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:18,530
It hasn't so far.

2415
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:19,130
Hello, intercom.

2416
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:19,730
Hello.

2417
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:23,690
It's scary not having a flashlight, actually.

2418
01:41:23,850 --> 01:41:24,570
I know, it is.

2419
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:25,950
I don't think there's anything else in here.

2420
01:41:26,910 --> 01:41:28,470
There are no more doors here?

2421
01:41:28,610 --> 01:41:30,150
There's a door across from us over here.

2422
01:41:30,190 --> 01:41:31,290
Oh, let's go over there, yeah.

2423
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:37,460
Ooh, blue light.

2424
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:38,000
Hello?

2425
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:42,300
Oh, we're in the news station room now.

2426
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:45,320
China 5 News here to report on these alien sightings.

2427
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:48,740
Hmm.

2428
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,340
I guess this is another news station.

2429
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:52,340
Oh, oh, what's that?

2430
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:54,140
Uh-oh.

2431
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:55,460
Wait, what's that sound?

2432
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:56,640
What's that sound?

2433
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:57,280
What?

2434
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:58,300
Oh, oh!

2435
01:41:58,300 --> 01:41:59,080
It's the baby!

2436
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:00,000
It's the baby!

2437
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:02,880
I got a picture of the baby.

2438
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,380
I got him, I got him, I got the baby, I got the baby!

2439
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:06,100
Let me fucking squeeble.

2440
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:08,000
I got a squeeble.

2441
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:11,440
Where'd he go?

2442
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,440
He's apparently chasing us, so we might wanna be...

2443
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:17,900
Oh god, oh god.

2444
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:19,020
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

2445
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:20,560
I do not wanna give you my legs!

2446
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:23,960
He's coming!

2447
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:24,700
He's...

2448
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:25,200
Ah, baby!

2449
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:26,260
Ah, baby!

2450
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:27,280
There's a baby!

2451
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:30,430
I'm jumping.

2452
01:42:30,630 --> 01:42:31,390
I'm jumping down.

2453
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:33,810
Hello.

2454
01:42:35,870 --> 01:42:36,910
Hey, you guys good?

2455
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:37,630
Yeah!

2456
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:39,770
I don't think this guy can get us from here.

2457
01:42:40,770 --> 01:42:41,790
I too am good.

2458
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:42,870
Where are you?

2459
01:42:43,110 --> 01:42:44,030
Yeah, he can't get me.

2460
01:42:44,090 --> 01:42:45,590
I'm on the high ground now.

2461
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:46,090
Oh, okay.

2462
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:48,990
I'm like on the ceiling of the news station bit.

2463
01:42:49,070 --> 01:42:49,690
Oh, nice!

2464
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:51,410
We got the baby.

2465
01:42:51,930 --> 01:42:54,590
We got lots of good stuff going on here.

2466
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:56,770
Yeah, we have all the good photos.

2467
01:42:57,110 --> 01:42:57,250
Yeah.

2468
01:42:57,910 --> 01:42:59,030
Wait, there's something over there.

2469
01:42:59,050 --> 01:42:59,710
Do you see that?

2470
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:00,710
What?

2471
01:43:00,930 --> 01:43:01,370
Oh, that.

2472
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:03,010
That's probably some alien matter.

2473
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:03,850
You wanna go post by it?

2474
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:04,670
Yeah, I'll take a picture of that.

2475
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:05,130
Yeah, yeah.

2476
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:05,870
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2477
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:06,890
I'll post next to it.

2478
01:43:07,870 --> 01:43:08,650
I'll come with you.

2479
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:12,650
Which way are you guys going?

2480
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:14,270
I'm still just hiding on the rooftop bit.

2481
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:19,070
We're on the table.

2482
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:21,530
Yeah, we're just chilling.

2483
01:43:22,130 --> 01:43:23,230
We're just chill, guys.

2484
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:24,650
Oh my god, there's something behind you!

2485
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:25,550
It's me.

2486
01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:28,410
Oh!

2487
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:30,450
Wait, there's something on the other side of the...

2488
01:43:30,450 --> 01:43:32,870
No, no, literally, there's something that just went over there.

2489
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:33,230
Hold on.

2490
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:34,030
Oh.

2491
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:34,410
Who's that?

2492
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:36,010
Was it not...

2493
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:36,510
Who's that?

2494
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:37,030
Was it the baby?

2495
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:39,370
It looked like it was the baby.

2496
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:40,790
You scared me.

2497
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:42,070
I don't think it was the squeaker.

2498
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:43,490
Oh, shit!

2499
01:43:43,970 --> 01:43:44,650
When did that show up?

2500
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:45,350
We opened the door.

2501
01:43:45,370 --> 01:43:46,150
Oh, yeah, we got that.

2502
01:43:46,830 --> 01:43:48,110
Oh, there's a dead guy there, too.

2503
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:49,110
Uh-oh.

2504
01:43:49,410 --> 01:43:49,910
I hear him.

2505
01:43:49,970 --> 01:43:50,370
I hear him.

2506
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:50,850
I hear it.

2507
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:53,030
I hear him growling.

2508
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:53,950
I hear him walking.

2509
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:56,010
There's enough room for three people up here, Lime.

2510
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:58,570
Oh, there's something on the stairwell up there.

2511
01:43:58,570 --> 01:43:59,290
Oh, there is?

2512
01:43:59,690 --> 01:44:00,630
Oh, they're all up here.

2513
01:44:00,730 --> 01:44:01,830
Through that door over there, yeah.

2514
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:03,330
They're camping us!

2515
01:44:03,390 --> 01:44:04,410
What is this, New York?

2516
01:44:04,650 --> 01:44:04,890
Look, this is New York.

2517
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:05,850
We should skedaddle.

2518
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:06,550
Yeah.

2519
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:07,530
We should really leave.

2520
01:44:07,770 --> 01:44:08,670
I think we should leave.

2521
01:44:08,690 --> 01:44:09,410
How do we get out?

2522
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:11,050
Oh, let's go up the stairway here.

2523
01:44:11,290 --> 01:44:12,510
Didn't you say it's on the stairwell?

2524
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:13,270
Are they camping?

2525
01:44:13,350 --> 01:44:13,590
Yeah.

2526
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:14,510
No, through the door.

2527
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:15,370
Let's through the door.

2528
01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:15,790
Okay.

2529
01:44:17,530 --> 01:44:20,070
Uh, I think to get out, we go back this way?

2530
01:44:21,230 --> 01:44:21,590
Uh...

2531
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:22,230
Can we come through here?

2532
01:44:22,230 --> 01:44:22,970
This looks right.

2533
01:44:23,150 --> 01:44:25,130
Yeah, because we closed all the doors.

2534
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:27,610
And there was a lantern.

2535
01:44:27,850 --> 01:44:28,150
Yeah, yeah.

2536
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:28,810
And then up here?

2537
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:29,970
Uh-huh.

2538
01:44:32,370 --> 01:44:32,690
See?

2539
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:33,250
Oh, yeah.

2540
01:44:33,630 --> 01:44:36,450
I would never lead you astray with my horrific sense of direction.

2541
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:36,810
Uh -huh.

2542
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:37,930
Wait, what's...

2543
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:39,010
This is the exit over here.

2544
01:44:39,130 --> 01:44:39,530
Yeah, okay.

2545
01:44:40,010 --> 01:44:40,670
This way, yeah.

2546
01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:41,410
Yeah, yeah.

2547
01:44:41,470 --> 01:44:42,310
I mean, that's the exit.

2548
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:43,250
Do we want to leave or...

2549
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:43,430
Oh!

2550
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:43,810
Oh!

2551
01:44:44,130 --> 01:44:44,970
I think we might...

2552
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:45,370
What?

2553
01:44:46,770 --> 01:44:47,430
What is that?

2554
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:48,130
I don't know.

2555
01:44:48,510 --> 01:44:48,910
I don't know.

2556
01:44:48,930 --> 01:44:50,190
Do you want a photo of it before we go?

2557
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:50,750
Yeah, sure.

2558
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:50,850
Okay.

2559
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:52,450
Last photo before we go.

2560
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:53,550
It's kind of stompy.

2561
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:54,650
Yeah, I was going to say it's big.

2562
01:44:54,730 --> 01:44:55,270
It's a big boy.

2563
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:56,790
Oh, there it is!

2564
01:44:57,470 --> 01:44:58,130
It's a stalker!

2565
01:44:58,230 --> 01:44:59,090
Stalker, no stalking!

2566
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:00,290
Oh, we are going to shamble.

2567
01:45:00,810 --> 01:45:01,450
Come here.

2568
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:02,050
We shamble.

2569
01:45:02,230 --> 01:45:03,530
Oh, I missed it.

2570
01:45:03,690 --> 01:45:03,970
Wait.

2571
01:45:04,230 --> 01:45:04,670
Oh, don't pause!

2572
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:05,350
Don't pause next time!

2573
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:07,290
I'm out of photos.

2574
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:09,370
Running!

2575
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:11,870
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

2576
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:34,440
There is a dog right next to you.

2577
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:35,620
You are going to die.

2578
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:41,740
Damn,

2579
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:47,510
she lived!

2580
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:49,670
How did she live?

2581
01:45:53,470 --> 01:45:54,550
How did she live?

2582
01:45:58,250 --> 01:45:59,090
My camera!

2583
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:00,950
You guys, I got that epic shot!

2584
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:01,870
No!

2585
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:03,930
Nobody will see it!

2586
01:46:05,230 --> 01:46:07,210
I don't even know where my camera is.

2587
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:08,190
It's actually missing.

2588
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:09,810
Oh, wait.

2589
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:10,930
No, it's right there.

2590
01:46:20,710 --> 01:46:22,690
She had her pro flashlight.

2591
01:46:25,330 --> 01:46:26,690
She's right here.

2592
01:46:30,810 --> 01:46:32,750
No, I'm over there!

2593
01:46:34,230 --> 01:46:37,130
To be fair, what was I supposed to do?

2594
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:41,450
What else was I supposed to do?

2595
01:46:41,730 --> 01:46:42,650
I got the best shot!

2596
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:44,850
I got the best shot!

2597
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:46,770
Nobody will ever know it.

2598
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:51,890
I died for the journalism.

2599
01:46:52,730 --> 01:46:55,530
Someday somebody will see my camera!

2600
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:57,770
And we'll go!

2601
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:01,710
Oh, hi Lime!

2602
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:02,210
You died!

2603
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:02,690
Oh no!

2604
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,240
No, Doki!

2605
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:12,520
Doki, don't be a coward!

2606
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:16,380
Oh my god, typical Doki...

2607
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,880
Doki coward bird.

2608
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,480
How did you die, Lime?

2609
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:26,820
I guess we'll never know.

2610
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:32,760
How did you die?

2611
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:39,120
Did you know that that big guy can actually snatch you off of the rooftops if he's not distracted?

2612
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:39,780
Because he did.

2613
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:45,420
I got such a good photo of him.

2614
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:48,760
And now we'll never see because Doki decided to leave.

2615
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:51,120
She doesn't care about the journalism!

2616
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:52,980
She doesn't care about the journalism!

2617
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:55,000
Let's get the plane first and wait for it.

2618
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:56,960
There's my photo.

2619
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:57,940
There's a photo of you.

2620
01:47:58,060 --> 01:48:01,020
These are going to be the only photos of him before he died.

2621
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:03,880
There's the beautiful cab.

2622
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:06,720
And then there's the stalker.

2623
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,200
Oh wow, what's that one?

2624
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:13,700
You couldn't even get his face!

2625
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:16,380
A picture of the big guy's dick.

2626
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:17,060
Fantastic.

2627
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:17,920
Good job, everybody.

2628
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:20,240
And I took us to the next level!

2629
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:22,080
You're welcome, everybody.

2630
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:24,360
Look at that.

2631
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,840
My beautiful photo.

2632
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:28,200
Coward bird over here.

2633
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:29,220
Coward bird.

2634
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:34,140
My beautiful photo in the front page yet again.

2635
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:37,040
What do you want to spend our money on?

2636
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:39,100
MVP.

2637
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:42,000
We need a pro camera.

2638
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:47,440
We could each have pro cameras.

2639
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:48,980
We could.

2640
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:49,360
That's true.

2641
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:53,120
But that does lower the amount of total photos we can take because it can only hold 7.

2642
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:54,140
Oh true.

2643
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,720
Yeah, that's like the disadvantage I guess.

2644
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:57,840
The trade -off.

2645
01:48:57,980 --> 01:48:59,700
We could get like, sports shoes.

2646
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:01,320
So we can run faster.

2647
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:03,020
We could get more health too.

2648
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:04,900
We could get a pair of sports shoes.

2649
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,340
And then we could also maybe get a flashy camera.

2650
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:09,040
Because that's like a good middle ground.

2651
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:10,340
Oh, that's true.

2652
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:11,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2653
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:14,300
Okay, so let's do sports shoes.

2654
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:16,600
And a flashy camera.

2655
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:19,040
I can't believe I lived there.

2656
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:21,480
That monster killed all the military men and I lived.

2657
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:24,060
I watched that and I was like, oh she's dead for sure.

2658
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:24,700
How the hell?

2659
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:25,740
Yeah, I thought I was dead.

2660
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,420
I wasn't looking at my screen anymore.

2661
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:28,440
I was like, goodbye.

2662
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:29,260
Don't let Doki...

2663
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:29,860
Who wants the shoes?

2664
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:30,540
Who wants the camera?

2665
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,360
Don't let Doki take the... Okay, never mind.

2666
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:37,340
She's just going to use it to run away and not do anything.

2667
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:42,020
I think Lime should do it because she's been the camera picker up here.

2668
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:45,020
Sick kicks, we're going.

2669
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,660
Okay, I'll get it.

2670
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:55,000
We don't have a flashlight because I mismanaged our money.

2671
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:56,780
That's fine.

2672
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:58,060
Oh, you have a flashlight?

2673
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:58,720
Fantastic.

2674
01:49:58,920 --> 01:49:59,900
Someone else use it.

2675
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:01,200
I got it, I got it.

2676
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:01,960
We're good, we're good.

2677
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,240
It's because Doki hasn't died.

2678
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:08,920
Yeah, we're in crime level three now, I'm pretty sure.

2679
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:10,160
Crime level?

2680
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:11,360
Monster crime.

2681
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:15,030
Real alien crimes here.

2682
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:18,400
Those monsters.

2683
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:19,880
God dammit.

2684
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Alien crime.

2685
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:27,840
Ever since that monster became mayor, crime levels have risen.

2686
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:30,220
What's special about this camera?

2687
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:31,220
It's just a flash?

2688
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:36,400
Yeah, it's got an inbuilt flash.

2689
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:36,780
Okay.

2690
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:39,110
10% extra points on photos.

2691
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:40,160
Oh, okay.

2692
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:42,000
Racist, that darn monster!

2693
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:48,860
I can't believe streamers are being monstrous right now.

2694
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:51,600
Isn't like people in Townsville hate monsters?

2695
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:52,920
Oh look, we're so close.

2696
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:54,320
To the helicopter.

2697
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:55,940
The city of Townsville.

2698
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:00,460
That's right, they don't deserve to work in our city.

2699
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:01,540
Nice.

2700
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,400
Oh, there's a building over to the right here.

2701
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:04,580
Wait, there's one right here too.

2702
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:08,220
Do you want to go to the city mall or whatever that building is?

2703
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:09,280
Whichever.

2704
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:09,960
I don't think it matters.

2705
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:12,300
I feel like this one's closer, just a little bit.

2706
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:14,160
Okay, what's up?

2707
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:16,540
It's the same, we've been here before.

2708
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:17,560
Have we?

2709
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:20,380
Oh, it's the place with the helicopter.

2710
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:21,160
Yeah.

2711
01:51:22,820 --> 01:51:24,580
I hear growling already.

2712
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:25,760
Oh, he's right!

2713
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:26,860
Nevermind, that's a man.

2714
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:29,580
Help!

2715
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:31,960
Oh God!

2716
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:32,920
There's a baby!

2717
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:34,000
Someone, someone!

2718
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:34,940
I got you.

2719
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:35,780
What the fuck?

2720
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:36,920
I got a photo, don't worry.

2721
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,520
I got the photo.

2722
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:38,940
Oh, it's the fucking baby.

2723
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:40,120
It's the fucking baby!

2724
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:41,660
What's he doing?

2725
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:46,600
Hey, get out of my shot, man.

2726
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:48,580
Where's the baby?

2727
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:49,420
Oh, he can see points.

2728
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:53,220
Alright, don't worry, I'm okay, guys, if you were wondering.

2729
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,060
Yeah, we're all great.

2730
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:55,720
Yeah, we're fine.

2731
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:57,060
Was that the baby that got me?

2732
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:57,940
I didn't even see him.

2733
01:51:57,960 --> 01:51:58,600
No, it was a trap.

2734
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:00,060
No, no, it was a trap.

2735
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:01,520
He got dangled from the trap.

2736
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,660
Oh my God, he just ran.

2737
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:07,760
How is there so many monsters right off the bat?

2738
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:08,220
I know.

2739
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:09,760
Kids are on three stars.

2740
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:10,520
Oh, he's right there.

2741
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:11,220
Hello, baby.

2742
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:13,620
We're both next to the baby.

2743
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:15,420
Oh, never mind, he left.

2744
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:16,060
Goodbye, baby.

2745
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:17,860
Bye, baby.

2746
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:18,780
Goodbye, little man.

2747
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:20,140
Oh, I hear him.

2748
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:21,840
I hope we don't just chase the baby.

2749
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,640
Nah, well, I mean...

2750
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:24,620
Oh, shit!

2751
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:26,420
What is it?

2752
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:27,140
Stalker.

2753
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:27,600
Baby!

2754
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:28,480
Baby!

2755
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:31,340
Where?

2756
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:32,280
What did you see?

2757
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:34,460
It was the stalker.

2758
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:35,840
Remember the stalker that came out?

2759
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:37,370
Yeah, you have to like...

2760
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:45,020
I think he might be like that guy in Lethal Company where you have to see him in order for him not to murder you.

2761
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:45,940
The bracken or whatever?

2762
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:47,080
Yeah.

2763
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:49,240
What the hell was that?

2764
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:51,960
It was the stalker again.

2765
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:53,720
What's going on in there?

2766
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:55,500
Squishy noises.

2767
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:56,720
It's really squishy.

2768
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:58,200
We should photograph the squishy noises.

2769
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,420
I'm gonna...

2770
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:03,320
If you feel close to the thing, always emote.

2771
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:03,940
Just press it.

2772
01:53:04,660 --> 01:53:04,960
Uh-oh.

2773
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:06,280
I hear...

2774
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:08,720
Oh, the baby killed him!

2775
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:09,700
What the fuck?

2776
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:10,700
Oh my god!

2777
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:12,160
The baby killed him!

2778
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:14,020
Hold on.

2779
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:17,860
He's afraid of light.

2780
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,080
The baby is afraid of light, I think.

2781
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:23,700
Hold on.

2782
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:26,160
How did the baby kill the fucking stalker though?

2783
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,060
Wait, wait.

2784
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:33,860
The baby is awesome!

2785
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:34,800
Thanks, baby!

2786
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:37,220
We appreciate you, baby.

2787
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:38,340
He's standing there.

2788
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:42,400
Oh, I can move this.

2789
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:43,700
Oh damn, we can take it.

2790
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:46,420
We can take it for a better photo.

2791
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:49,080
Oh, he's so...

2792
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:52,360
Okay, he doesn't stop like squishing once you pick him up.

2793
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,440
Oh, there's a goop here.

2794
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:58,020
I don't wanna step on that.

2795
01:53:58,080 --> 01:53:58,540
I don't either.

2796
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:00,840
Put him on it, put him on it.

2797
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:02,620
Nope.

2798
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,940
Why are you following us, dude?

2799
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:09,560
You have like no self-preservation instincts whatsoever.

2800
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:10,840
Wait, maybe he can step through it.

2801
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:12,080
We just parkour here?

2802
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:13,140
Oh, true.

2803
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:14,520
YOLO.

2804
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:16,980
It's fine.

2805
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,740
I think it's actually okay.

2806
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:19,920
Are you gonna come?

2807
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:23,220
So, I think the baby might get real scary if you don't have any light.

2808
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:23,740
Yeah.

2809
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:27,800
Cause the baby just fucking brutalized that thing.

2810
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:29,640
Yeah, that...

2811
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:30,240
Good for us.

2812
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:33,440
That baby was just a little man, but like, he was a big boy.

2813
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:37,240
Oh, a holder.

2814
01:54:38,020 --> 01:54:38,780
Uh-oh, what was that?

2815
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:41,460
It's him right there.

2816
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:43,100
Hey there.

2817
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:44,080
Shiny.

2818
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:44,840
You just chilling?

2819
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:45,600
He's just chilling.

2820
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:46,920
Yeah, he does the thing and he's screaming.

2821
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:47,240
Oh, he's gonna vibrate?

2822
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:48,600
See ya.

2823
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:49,800
Bye.

2824
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:51,580
I don't get what he does.

2825
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:51,920
Maybe...

2826
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:53,160
He's like, peace out.

2827
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:54,980
He does a spin.

2828
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:55,860
That's what he does.

2829
01:54:56,300 --> 01:54:57,660
He just is there for the vibe.

2830
01:54:58,620 --> 01:54:59,620
He doesn't really need to do anything.

2831
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:00,980
Where are we going now after this?

2832
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:02,360
That guy is still following us.

2833
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:03,060
I know.

2834
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:04,020
Are you okay, man?

2835
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:09,240
I think he's gonna follow us until we like get out of the house.

2836
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:11,340
The house?

2837
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:13,460
I'd hate for this to be my house.

2838
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:13,960
I know.

2839
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:16,200
Yeah, my big ass house right here.

2840
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:18,320
Uh-oh, what was that?

2841
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:18,980
Oh, Jesus.

2842
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:19,760
Hello again.

2843
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:21,600
What was that?

2844
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:21,640
What was that?

2845
01:55:22,260 --> 01:55:23,700
It was the cthulhu.

2846
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:25,020
Oh, it's him again.

2847
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:26,560
Yeah, he's just chilling.

2848
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:28,800
I don't really understand his bit.

2849
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:30,140
Oh!

2850
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:31,560
What is that?

2851
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:33,520
It's him again.

2852
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:34,340
Isn't that the same guy?

2853
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:35,420
It sounds like him, yeah.

2854
01:55:39,670 --> 01:55:40,070
Maybe.

2855
01:55:41,230 --> 01:55:41,490
Meow.

2856
01:55:43,070 --> 01:55:43,470
Meow.

2857
01:55:43,830 --> 01:55:44,890
Moe goes minting.

2858
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:46,430
Where do you get your photos printed?

2859
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:48,630
Oh, this leads to the main entrance.

2860
01:55:49,870 --> 01:55:50,330
Oh, does it?

2861
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:50,630
Yeah.

2862
01:55:50,630 --> 01:55:51,170
Oh, we should go back.

2863
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:51,770
I think...

2864
01:55:51,770 --> 01:55:54,350
I think it should be enough time for a big guy.

2865
01:55:55,010 --> 01:55:55,330
Probably.

2866
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:02,040
Yeah, we're right here.

2867
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:03,640
Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2868
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:04,080
Hello.

2869
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:06,160
Hello.

2870
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:07,400
Hello.

2871
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:08,060
Hello.

2872
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,460
We didn't go this way.

2873
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:11,720
But there's only like...

2874
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:14,060
It seems like he killed the other...

2875
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:16,120
thing, so...

2876
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:17,560
Yeah, there's not a whole lot in here anymore.

2877
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:18,080
Yeah.

2878
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:19,500
Yeah, I feel like all...

2879
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:20,620
It's just a baby now.

2880
01:56:20,740 --> 01:56:21,460
Yeah, it's just a baby.

2881
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:22,740
Just one...

2882
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:23,420
whole baby.

2883
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:25,620
Oh, and he is out.

2884
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:26,340
He's here.

2885
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:27,740
Oh my god, I'm stuck.

2886
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:28,920
Oh, wait, what?

2887
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:32,020
Oh, sexy lady!

2888
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:33,400
Wait, I'll jump over.

2889
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:35,200
Oh, there's a mini-man.

2890
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:35,980
There's a mini-man.

2891
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:37,680
Oh, what did I get killed by?

2892
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:42,390
What did I get killed by?

2893
01:56:42,750 --> 01:56:43,750
What was there?

2894
01:56:44,290 --> 01:56:45,470
There was nothing there!

2895
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:50,700
What did I get killed by?

2896
01:56:51,620 --> 01:56:52,820
I got you, I got you.

2897
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:54,540
Manhole worm?

2898
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:54,980
What?

2899
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:01,120
I got killed by the manhole worm!

2900
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:02,420
Oh my god, Doki.

2901
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:06,200
Why do I always die?

2902
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:08,420
I hate these fucking types of games, man!

2903
01:57:16,790 --> 01:57:18,770
Sexy lady, save me!

2904
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:27,740
Oh my god.

2905
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,400
You guys didn't get my camera.

2906
01:57:30,220 --> 01:57:31,300
No, I got your camera.

2907
01:57:31,460 --> 01:57:32,160
Oh, you did?

2908
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:32,560
Okay.

2909
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:33,520
I did, yes.

2910
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:35,340
That's what her shoes are for.

2911
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:36,140
That was amazing.

2912
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:40,120
I saw that manhole cover moving and I was like, oh, that's weird.

2913
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:41,640
Then you went over there and got...

2914
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:42,920
I didn't even see!

2915
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:44,360
I was like, what killed me?

2916
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:45,360
That thing was around!

2917
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:47,100
I took a picture of it.

2918
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:48,180
You'll see it in a second.

2919
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:48,940
Okay.

2920
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:50,900
I know exactly what you're talking about.

2921
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:52,500
I saw it pop up, too.

2922
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:56,480
And that's the photo.

2923
01:57:58,500 --> 01:57:59,540
I hate that.

2924
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:00,020
Ugh.

2925
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:07,600
Sexy lady.

2926
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:08,240
What on earth?

2927
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:09,540
I didn't even see that guy.

2928
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:10,440
That's me!

2929
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:12,700
You didn't see the sexy lady?

2930
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,740
I was busy trying to save this camera.

2931
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,760
Your camera should be back on the desk.

2932
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:26,980
My favorite photo has to be this one.

2933
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:27,860
Oh, is it permanent?

2934
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:30,740
No, it's because I picked it up for you.

2935
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:31,540
Oh, that's right.

2936
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:38,680
Oh yeah, here's when you were getting trapped, by the way.

2937
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:40,620
Oh yeah, that's what it looked like.

2938
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:42,780
You were like, what's going on?

2939
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:46,780
I like how you got six shoes on as well.

2940
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:50,600
It looks like that Fortnite thing where you can change your shoes no matter who you are now.

2941
01:58:51,020 --> 01:58:51,780
It looks like that.

2942
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:55,000
Ugh.

2943
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:57,280
There's the baby.

2944
01:58:57,680 --> 01:59:01,580
I thought that thing was going to pop back out of the manhole and eat me when I tried to get your camera.

2945
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:07,160
Oh my god, I didn't realize there were like fucking traps too in the manhole.

2946
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:07,580
That's crazy.

2947
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:08,520
I didn't either.

2948
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,080
That's so evil.

2949
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:11,880
That's where you died.

2950
01:59:12,380 --> 01:59:12,900
I know.

2951
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:17,720
Man, I thought it was the military guy shot me or something.

2952
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:18,840
I was like, what the hell?

2953
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:19,400
Oh no, no.

2954
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:21,120
The bullets go through you.

2955
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:21,700
They do?

2956
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:23,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2957
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:26,220
I got shot like they shot me, but I guess I lived.

2958
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:29,960
It would be kind of harsh if you got friendly fired by those dudes on top of everything.

2959
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:31,160
I know, actually.

2960
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:32,260
Yeah, yeah.

2961
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:34,340
I'll just say I'm pretty fucking rough.

2962
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:37,880
Wait, you didn't see that giant tree monster?

2963
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:41,920
No, I was legitimately like trying to deal with the thumper that was throwing cars.

2964
01:59:42,260 --> 01:59:44,660
Oh yeah, that guy was around too.

2965
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:50,580
We're at two and a half.

2966
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:52,000
We just gotta run.

2967
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:54,200
I like the baby.

2968
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:59,880
I wanna go to a different house.

2969
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,280
I feel like we've explored that a lot already.

2970
02:00:02,640 --> 02:00:05,700
There was one on the right, but it seems as though the insides are just randomized.

2971
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:07,640
I think so.

2972
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:08,880
Wait, is there anything over here?

2973
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:12,240
There's like a back street down here.

2974
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:13,720
Yeah, we could try it.

2975
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:17,400
You could also go up, but I don't think you can get onto the building.

2976
02:00:17,660 --> 02:00:18,360
I'm not sure.

2977
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:21,560
I feel like it's just the Roothof perspective POV.

2978
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:22,860
Yeah, can we get inside?

2979
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,860
I assume not, but...

2980
02:00:24,860 --> 02:00:26,820
This feels like it's lit up for me to go in.

2981
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:27,180
I know!

2982
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,560
There's like weird lighting everywhere too.

2983
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:32,740
Like this yellow light here.

2984
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:35,800
Game design rules tell me I should be able to get inside that hut, but they...

2985
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:37,420
On the pink light.

2986
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:40,000
Wait, I think we just went in a circle a little bit.

2987
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:40,660
We did.

2988
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:42,360
We went to the alleyway.

2989
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:44,000
At least we know there's another way.

2990
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:46,260
We're back to Sushi Kyoto!

2991
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:48,600
Why can't we go there?

2992
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:50,040
Oh, there's somebody in there.

2993
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:51,680
I don't think we want to.

2994
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,200
He's like, no, this is my Sushi Kyoto.

2995
02:00:55,220 --> 02:00:57,780
There's another house over there we haven't gone to.

2996
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:00,320
What, this one right here?

2997
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:03,740
We might actually make it to level 5.

2998
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:05,300
We're gamers.

2999
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:12,700
Oh, it's this area again.

3000
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:14,180
Yeah, I think we're randomized.

3001
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:15,280
There's a little rat.

3002
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,140
A rat?

3003
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:17,500
Oh, the stalker!

3004
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:19,320
Fuck off, stalker!

3005
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:20,760
Stalker, no stalking!

3006
02:01:21,780 --> 02:01:22,820
Look at him go!

3007
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:27,200
Wait, there's a trap.

3008
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:28,720
There's a string trap nearby.

3009
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:29,640
How do you know?

3010
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:31,640
Because it went off on the camera.

3011
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:34,800
Oh, look on the ceiling, I think, is where you'll see.

3012
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:36,860
Yeah, I don't see it though.

3013
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:39,800
Just knock me down if it gets me, I guess.

3014
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:42,440
Oh, there's a weird humpback tick thing!

3015
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:43,120
Ew!

3016
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:43,840
What?

3017
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:44,360
It was on here.

3018
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:45,900
Humpback feature.

3019
02:01:46,900 --> 02:01:47,240
Stalker?

3020
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:48,220
Stalker 5!

3021
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:48,900
Stalker 5!

3022
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:49,940
I got him.

3023
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:51,680
Oh, there he is!

3024
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:53,360
What the hell is that?

3025
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:55,340
I told you, it's a weird humpback tick!

3026
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:02,280
I'm gonna point at him.

3027
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:05,480
Look at him go!

3028
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:07,560
Shamble chasing.

3029
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:09,340
What the heck?

3030
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:10,940
Oh, I caught a selfie of that.

3031
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,200
Ew, I hear something on the left.

3032
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:16,620
There's a lot of stuff down here.

3033
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:17,340
There's a lot going on.

3034
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:18,060
I can ride again.

3035
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:21,680
I feel like we don't even need to leave this front room.

3036
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,800
I think we can just stay in here and things will come to us.

3037
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:24,700
Stalker, no stalking!

3038
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:27,360
Stalker, no stalking!

3039
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:30,520
I like the stalker.

3040
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:32,380
The rat's in here.

3041
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:34,280
Oh, wait, no, this is a headcrab.

3042
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:35,360
There's a headcrab in here.

3043
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:36,000
Oh!

3044
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:38,980
Oh, what was that?

3045
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:39,940
Oh, okay, nevermind.

3046
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:42,760
You cannot take a picture of it through the glass, so you need to go in there.

3047
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:43,540
There's the rat!

3048
02:02:43,620 --> 02:02:44,440
Rat, rat, rat, rat!

3049
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:45,980
Little rat!

3050
02:02:46,620 --> 02:02:47,440
Oh, he's diseased.

3051
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:48,780
Oh my god, where is he trying to go?

3052
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:49,720
He's diseased.

3053
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:51,760
Rattler.

3054
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:52,860
We gotta try and get the headcrab.

3055
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:55,020
I have a feeling as soon as that door opens, we're gonna be in trouble.

3056
02:02:55,780 --> 02:02:56,840
Okay, we're just letting him in.

3057
02:02:58,300 --> 02:02:58,940
Oh, someone's...

3058
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:00,300
Not me, please!

3059
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:03,620
I got it.

3060
02:03:03,980 --> 02:03:04,720
I got the photo.

3061
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:07,500
It's okay, guys.

3062
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:08,320
I got the photo.

3063
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:09,480
Oh, I didn't even die.

3064
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:10,320
Oh, I'm out of...

3065
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:11,300
I'm out of film, though.

3066
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:12,000
Dang it.

3067
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:13,440
Weird tick creature's back.

3068
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:15,300
He's gone.

3069
02:03:15,580 --> 02:03:15,700
Where?

3070
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:17,960
He went off to the left.

3071
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:20,700
I feel like we definitely...

3072
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:22,840
Oh, oh, something just died, I think.

3073
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:26,680
Stalker, no stalking!

3074
02:03:27,220 --> 02:03:28,540
There's something else in here?

3075
02:03:28,660 --> 02:03:29,700
It's like a big guy.

3076
02:03:29,860 --> 02:03:30,480
Rat's coming back.

3077
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:31,440
Watch your feet, watch your feet!

3078
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:32,500
Where is he?

3079
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:32,900
Where is he?

3080
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:35,820
He just ran to the end of the room you guys went into.

3081
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:36,320
Oh.

3082
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:38,840
The hunchback thing is in here, too.

3083
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:39,600
Oh, there's so many monsters here.

3084
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:41,060
Hunchback tick creature thing.

3085
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,000
Oh, he's coming up.

3086
02:03:42,020 --> 02:03:42,580
He's just chilling.

3087
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:44,140
Can you take a photo with him?

3088
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:44,920
Oh, god.

3089
02:03:45,180 --> 02:03:45,560
I'm running.

3090
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:47,440
He's coming after me.

3091
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:50,660
In a really slow kind of way.

3092
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,120
What the...

3093
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:54,660
Hey, booba.

3094
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:56,500
I'm a journalist!

3095
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:58,920
I have a journalist pass!

3096
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:00,880
I'm journalist immunity!

3097
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:05,720
There's no point in me staying.

3098
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:06,980
I have no...

3099
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:07,980
I have no film left.

3100
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:10,020
Wait, where is...

3101
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:11,480
Oh, at four I left.

3102
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:12,920
Then go get some pictures.

3103
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:13,460
Then this guy will show up.

3104
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:14,480
I feel like...

3105
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:16,260
Yeah, big guy is probably already outside.

3106
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:17,880
I don't know.

3107
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:19,440
We didn't spend that long in here.

3108
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:20,140
Yeah, we're kidding.

3109
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:20,260
Let's see.

3110
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:22,680
Oh, yes, he is!

3111
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:24,280
Oh, no, he's up!

3112
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:24,680
He's here!

3113
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:25,340
He's here!

3114
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:25,700
He's here!

3115
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:26,100
He's here!

3116
02:04:26,180 --> 02:04:26,400
He's here!

3117
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:26,740
He's here!

3118
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:27,240
He's here!

3119
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:29,080
Here, get a picture of me in front of him!

3120
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:36,820
No, take a picture of me!

3121
02:04:36,820 --> 02:04:38,180
He's taking a good perspective picture.

3122
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:40,660
Got one.

3123
02:04:42,620 --> 02:04:43,580
He's crazy looking.

3124
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:46,500
Guys, our plane is on the other side.

3125
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:47,720
No, it's not.

3126
02:04:47,740 --> 02:04:49,960
Oh, uh...

3127
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:50,480
You're right.

3128
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:53,040
Guys, we locked ourselves in.

3129
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:55,140
Oh, no, he lost interest.

3130
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:55,800
He lost interest.

3131
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:56,420
We're so tiny.

3132
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:57,040
We're fine.

3133
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:57,560
Yeah.

3134
02:04:58,060 --> 02:04:59,740
Okay, I think we can head back, right?

3135
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:00,680
Yeah.

3136
02:05:00,980 --> 02:05:02,720
I feel like we want to get, like, oh.

3137
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:04,620
Circling around.

3138
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:06,380
Oh, oh, just kidding.

3139
02:05:06,860 --> 02:05:07,260
He's coming.

3140
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:10,380
Oh, lord.

3141
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:12,140
Oh.

3142
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:13,460
Oh.

3143
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:14,060
Oh.

3144
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:36,880
Wait, did all of us just fall through the fucking world?

3145
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:38,120
Yes, yes.

3146
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:42,160
Except Doki.

3147
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:45,220
Are you dead?

3148
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:46,240
Yeah.

3149
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:48,880
Did you fall through the planet?

3150
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:50,160
Yes, I did.

3151
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:52,000
Okay, me too.

3152
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:53,500
I think, did Doki...

3153
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:55,960
I think, did Doki kill us?

3154
02:05:56,040 --> 02:05:57,200
How did this happen?

3155
02:05:57,660 --> 02:05:58,220
No.

3156
02:05:58,220 --> 02:06:00,660
I don't think she did.

3157
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:08,180
She's gotta grab our stuff.

3158
02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:09,180
She's not going to.

3159
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:14,440
No, Doki would totally pay attention to the blue highlighted cameras on the floor.

3160
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:14,940
Yeah.

3161
02:06:17,660 --> 02:06:18,900
She's got this, bro.

3162
02:06:26,450 --> 02:06:27,970
Just go, Doki.

3163
02:06:28,250 --> 02:06:28,690
Where do you think she is?

3164
02:06:30,630 --> 02:06:31,590
Let's go have a look.

3165
02:06:31,590 --> 02:06:33,930
Wait, why is she just standing inside?

3166
02:06:34,210 --> 02:06:37,310
Oh, we dropped our bodies in the front of the chopper, so we can...

3167
02:06:37,310 --> 02:06:40,730
Yeah, yeah, no, they're right by the front of the chopper, so it should be really easy for her to get the stuff...

3168
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:43,190
Yeah, she just has to go.

3169
02:06:45,010 --> 02:06:46,470
There's only three minutes left.

3170
02:06:47,070 --> 02:06:47,690
She's gotta go.

3171
02:06:48,030 --> 02:06:48,910
Oh, she's got this.

3172
02:06:49,590 --> 02:06:51,770
As long as she doesn't get... Oh, there's like a stalker, right?

3173
02:06:52,090 --> 02:06:52,310
Oh, god.

3174
02:06:52,770 --> 02:06:55,890
Like, sometimes I can actually hear you guys when you're dead.

3175
02:06:56,510 --> 02:06:58,710
There's so many, there's so many monsters.

3176
02:06:58,710 --> 02:07:00,370
There's so many monsters.

3177
02:07:00,530 --> 02:07:01,690
I don't like this, girl.

3178
02:07:02,630 --> 02:07:03,710
Yeah, it'll go great.

3179
02:07:04,910 --> 02:07:06,410
Okay, I can make it.

3180
02:07:06,790 --> 02:07:07,550
I can make it.

3181
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:08,770
I can make it.

3182
02:07:09,050 --> 02:07:10,670
Come on, Dookie coward.

3183
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:11,430
Let's go.

3184
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:16,430
She just keeps going in and out.

3185
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:19,130
Oh, she's just hiding.

3186
02:07:22,570 --> 02:07:23,390
Doki, please.

3187
02:07:23,850 --> 02:07:24,790
Doki, come on.

3188
02:07:26,150 --> 02:07:26,750
Come on.

3189
02:07:26,750 --> 02:07:29,310
Okay, I can make it.

3190
02:07:29,530 --> 02:07:30,630
I can make it.

3191
02:07:30,770 --> 02:07:31,290
Come on.

3192
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:32,850
I can make it.

3193
02:07:33,870 --> 02:07:35,390
I believe in Dookie bravery.

3194
02:07:36,730 --> 02:07:37,410
The bravery?

3195
02:07:37,690 --> 02:07:38,010
I don't know.

3196
02:07:38,150 --> 02:07:38,430
Luck?

3197
02:07:38,570 --> 02:07:41,130
I think she has that stat more against her.

3198
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:42,070
Or like, for her.

3199
02:07:46,110 --> 02:07:47,190
There she goes.

3200
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:48,010
Oh, she's stuck.

3201
02:07:48,690 --> 02:07:48,950
Maybe?

3202
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:50,550
Oh, my god.

3203
02:07:53,510 --> 02:07:54,310
Dookie, Dookie.

3204
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:11,580
It's everywhere.

3205
02:08:14,060 --> 02:08:14,680
Hi.

3206
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:18,300
Mint and I got pressed through the world.

3207
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:21,540
Yeah, we actually no-clipped through the map and fell over.

3208
02:08:23,120 --> 02:08:28,380
There's a photo in Discord where I'm just looking up at the floor from below.

3209
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:34,760
We got no-clipped into oblivion.

3210
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:37,720
Yeah, I was like, oh, I'm doing well.

3211
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:40,940
I hesitated.

3212
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:44,120
There were so many monsters everywhere.

3213
02:08:45,780 --> 02:08:47,300
It's okay, it's okay.

3214
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:50,720
We're totally gonna get all 3,000 points that we need in this one run.

3215
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:52,640
Whoever said... we have two runs.

3216
02:08:52,860 --> 02:08:53,940
Oh, never mind, we have one run.

3217
02:08:54,180 --> 02:08:55,440
No, this is our last run.

3218
02:08:55,940 --> 02:08:59,120
Whoever said we were gonna get to level 5, they cursed us.

3219
02:08:59,700 --> 02:09:00,560
They cursed us.

3220
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:01,560
It's totally their fault.

3221
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:03,460
We had such a good run, too.

3222
02:09:04,460 --> 02:09:04,860
Dang.

3223
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:07,300
We all have to use all our photos.

3224
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,880
We have to use... we have to take as much as we can.

3225
02:09:10,020 --> 02:09:11,520
Yeah, don't waste on anything.

3226
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:12,860
And make sure we don't get doubles, too.

3227
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:16,700
Alright, we got this.

3228
02:09:18,820 --> 02:09:19,220
No.

3229
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:21,620
I don't think we've got this.

3230
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:25,160
I don't think we've got this.

3231
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:28,260
There was like 5 fucking monsters outside my door.

3232
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:30,680
Like, how the fuck was I gonna get out of there?

3233
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:36,060
It's such a shame because we no-clipped through the planet, it dumped our bodies by the helicopter and our cameras.

3234
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:39,260
Yeah, everything was... everything was right there.

3235
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:40,860
Yeah, everything was right there.

3236
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:41,600
Oh my god.

3237
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:48,080
The big red guy didn't block the only way across I would've ran.

3238
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:52,860
I feel like we should go to the door to the right side.

3239
02:09:53,200 --> 02:09:54,840
That had so many monsters.

3240
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,460
Okay, this one right here.

3241
02:09:58,060 --> 02:09:59,280
Yeah, the right side.

3242
02:10:01,900 --> 02:10:04,940
Oh wow, the truck is already overturned.

3243
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:07,400
It's okay, I can move it with my head, apparently.

3244
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,240
It gives us a little bit of a covering, you know?

3245
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:12,340
Yeah, that's true.

3246
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:15,400
Alright, let's go.

3247
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:18,900
Oh, we don't have a single flashlight anymore.

3248
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,940
And there's something zip-zooming around at the top.

3249
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:22,040
Oh, I see him, too.

3250
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:23,580
There's something at the top, do you see it?

3251
02:10:23,780 --> 02:10:24,460
Yeah, I see it.

3252
02:10:24,660 --> 02:10:25,940
I'm posing, I'm posing.

3253
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:27,540
Uh-oh, what's that?

3254
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:28,540
What the fuck is that?

3255
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:29,820
I don't like that.

3256
02:10:29,820 --> 02:10:31,640
Um, everything's wobbling.

3257
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:34,980
It's like a spider's man, it's called a polpo, apparently.

3258
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:35,900
Polpo!

3259
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:36,800
Hey, polpo.

3260
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:38,520
Yo, polpo.

3261
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:40,640
I cannot see anything so fucking dark.

3262
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:44,480
You can see a little bit better through your camera lens, but then you're gonna waste the battery.

3263
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:49,100
Oh, you don't waste battery, the thing is just the camera film.

3264
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:50,540
Oh, it is?

3265
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:51,440
No.

3266
02:10:51,460 --> 02:10:52,500
Yeah, it's not battery.

3267
02:10:52,900 --> 02:10:53,480
Oh, what was that?

3268
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:55,080
Oh god, it's a little vent gremlin.

3269
02:10:55,420 --> 02:10:55,640
Great.

3270
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:56,920
And a stalker.

3271
02:10:57,480 --> 02:10:58,180
Yeah, I saw that.

3272
02:10:58,180 --> 02:10:58,840
Another vent gremlin.

3273
02:10:59,320 --> 02:10:59,900
Leave me alone.

3274
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:00,500
Oh my god.

3275
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:01,840
What's he gonna do, huh?

3276
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:02,460
This guy's a dick.

3277
02:11:02,860 --> 02:11:03,880
Oh, he'll take your leg out.

3278
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:05,380
Yeah, he will actually take your leg out.

3279
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:05,820
Yeah, but I have a high ground.

3280
02:11:05,820 --> 02:11:07,800
He fucking murdered me and it was really funny.

3281
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:09,640
Yay.

3282
02:11:09,940 --> 02:11:10,740
Oh, there's something in there.

3283
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:12,340
Oh, it's another, it's the vent crawler again.

3284
02:11:12,580 --> 02:11:13,060
Hey, buddy.

3285
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:14,940
Oh, vent crawler.

3286
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:16,060
Those guys suck.

3287
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:16,760
Wait, let me in.

3288
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:17,680
Where'd the spider go?

3289
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:21,080
I had so many good photos too last time.

3290
02:11:21,700 --> 02:11:22,080
He's coming.

3291
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:23,040
Oh, there he is.

3292
02:11:23,660 --> 02:11:23,900
Ah!

3293
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:24,320
Ah!

3294
02:11:24,540 --> 02:11:25,340
What the hell?

3295
02:11:25,780 --> 02:11:26,140
Ugh.

3296
02:11:27,620 --> 02:11:28,340
I'm fine.

3297
02:11:28,740 --> 02:11:29,400
I'm fine.

3298
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:29,800
You good?

3299
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:30,680
Yeah.

3300
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:31,700
Glad to hear it.

3301
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:33,900
I'm leaving.

3302
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:36,100
I don't know.

3303
02:11:36,300 --> 02:11:39,900
Should we try and take, like, wait for the big guys to show up and take photos outside or something?

3304
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:41,340
Because I can't see anything.

3305
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:42,040
Do I still have my leg?

3306
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:42,920
No.

3307
02:11:43,200 --> 02:11:43,960
Well, you do.

3308
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:44,720
He does not.

3309
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:45,480
I don't, yeah.

3310
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:46,400
I lost a leg.

3311
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:47,700
Oh, okay.

3312
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:48,480
I'm okay too.

3313
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:50,540
Oh, so annoying.

3314
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:52,020
I'd like to get a picture of the stalker.

3315
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:55,640
Oh, there's another fucking beholder in here too.

3316
02:11:55,640 --> 02:11:56,340
A what?

3317
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:57,860
Go away, vent crawler.

3318
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:01,960
Okay, at like six minutes we have to get out because that's when the big guy spawns in, I feel.

3319
02:12:02,140 --> 02:12:02,520
Okay.

3320
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:05,840
Where's the military when we need them?

3321
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:09,240
What's the point of funding the military when they don't show up when we want them to?

3322
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:10,900
Hello?

3323
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:12,520
Is anybody coming out?

3324
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:13,200
Come on.

3325
02:12:13,460 --> 02:12:14,300
I think we're safe now.

3326
02:12:15,060 --> 02:12:16,400
I didn't realize there was a zoom in.

3327
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:17,000
Never mind.

3328
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:17,420
You're such an idiot.

3329
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:18,220
Is that a real guy?

3330
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:19,920
Wait, you haven't been zooming in?

3331
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:20,400
No.

3332
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:22,540
Oh.

3333
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:23,920
What was that?

3334
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:24,280
Hello?

3335
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:25,920
Are you guys...

3336
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:27,860
good now?

3337
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:28,620
Hello?

3338
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:30,820
There's so many things.

3339
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:30,980
There he is!

3340
02:12:30,980 --> 02:12:31,100
There he is!

3341
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:31,780
Oh, there's the stalker.

3342
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:33,180
I got him.

3343
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:33,520
Woo!

3344
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:34,040
He's so fast.

3345
02:12:34,060 --> 02:12:34,240
I didn't get him.

3346
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:36,700
We have to pretend we can't see him so he gets closer.

3347
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:37,100
Yeah.

3348
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:43,580
Gotta be like, I sure hope no big stalker comes and sneaks up behind me.

3349
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:44,920
I don't notice him.

3350
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:51,840
It's a shame if someone just shows up behind me.

3351
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:53,700
I'd sure hate it if a vent crawler...

3352
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:55,460
ate my ass right now.

3353
02:12:55,500 --> 02:12:56,920
I actually would hate that.

3354
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:00,700
Oh, you're up here.

3355
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:01,340
That's a good idea.

3356
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:15,000
I think we should split up and go in different directions.

3357
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:15,860
Oh, yeah.

3358
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:16,840
That's a great idea.

3359
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:17,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3360
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:18,480
Okay.

3361
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:19,760
Let's split up and look for clues.

3362
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:21,020
I've already split...

3363
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:23,280
Oh, there's a little zoomer guy in there.

3364
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:24,420
Zoomer, zoomer, zoomer, zoomer.

3365
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:25,280
Oh, I forgot to...

3366
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:28,380
The pompa thing is still at the top there.

3367
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:30,480
Yeah, we're not gonna...

3368
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:31,320
Oh, there's another zoomer.

3369
02:13:32,260 --> 02:13:32,620
Yeah.

3370
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:34,780
I don't really know what this guy does.

3371
02:13:34,860 --> 02:13:35,160
I don't know.

3372
02:13:35,180 --> 02:13:36,460
He also seems to be not...

3373
02:13:36,460 --> 02:13:37,280
Oh, stalker!

3374
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:38,160
Dang it, stalker!

3375
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:38,940
Oh, stalker, no stalking!

3376
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:40,300
No!

3377
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:42,400
I got quite a few points from him.

3378
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:43,020
I missed...

3379
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:43,600
Oh, what's that?

3380
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:46,980
I'm not getting any of these.

3381
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:47,680
What the hell?

3382
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:49,200
You see that on the other side?

3383
02:13:50,820 --> 02:13:51,180
No.

3384
02:13:51,980 --> 02:13:52,300
Yeah.

3385
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:52,400
What's that?

3386
02:13:52,780 --> 02:13:54,480
Although the pompa is still over there.

3387
02:13:54,500 --> 02:13:54,660
Oh, there's the pompa.

3388
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:55,620
There he is.

3389
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:57,400
Hey, pompa, come say hi.

3390
02:13:58,660 --> 02:13:58,920
Don't be shy.

3391
02:13:58,920 --> 02:13:59,440
Alright, we should go out.

3392
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:00,180
It's five-minute mark.

3393
02:14:00,280 --> 02:14:00,760
It's five-minute mark.

3394
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:01,480
Don't be shy, pompa.

3395
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:02,020
Okay.

3396
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:03,960
It's a five-minute mark.

3397
02:14:04,020 --> 02:14:04,820
You should be outside.

3398
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:07,220
I wasted all my photos.

3399
02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:10,620
Oh!

3400
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:20,620
Oh, there's soldiers!

3401
02:14:25,380 --> 02:14:26,380
There's a big guy.

3402
02:14:28,220 --> 02:14:31,380
We should try to take photos outside the helicopter or something.

3403
02:14:31,700 --> 02:14:32,320
I can't run!

3404
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:33,060
I can't run!

3405
02:14:33,060 --> 02:14:34,060
My health is too low!

3406
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:35,480
I can't run!

3407
02:14:35,580 --> 02:14:36,540
My health is too low!

3408
02:14:46,290 --> 02:14:47,550
I can't run!

3409
02:14:47,870 --> 02:14:48,310
I'm going!

3410
02:14:48,670 --> 02:14:49,370
I'm trying!

3411
02:14:50,010 --> 02:14:50,690
I'm trying!

3412
02:14:50,950 --> 02:14:51,590
She's still here!

3413
02:14:51,690 --> 02:14:52,210
She's still here!

3414
02:14:52,390 --> 02:14:53,430
I can't run!

3415
02:14:57,510 --> 02:14:58,190
I'm coming.

3416
02:14:58,790 --> 02:14:59,430
I'm this lady.

3417
02:14:59,630 --> 02:15:01,010
This lady is faster than me.

3418
02:15:02,070 --> 02:15:03,310
Because you've not got a leg.

3419
02:15:11,590 --> 02:15:12,970
We made it.

3420
02:15:14,070 --> 02:15:14,810
To this.

3421
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:17,310
It all comes down to this.

3422
02:15:17,890 --> 02:15:18,850
We made it up.

3423
02:15:19,330 --> 02:15:20,990
We made it up, honey.

3424
02:15:21,370 --> 02:15:21,870
No, you didn't!

3425
02:15:23,530 --> 02:15:27,190
It all comes down to our 30 photos.

3426
02:15:27,350 --> 02:15:28,410
Our 30 photos.

3427
02:15:28,570 --> 02:15:29,090
Let's go.

3428
02:15:29,710 --> 02:15:30,310
Come on.

3429
02:15:30,590 --> 02:15:31,010
Alright.

3430
02:15:31,430 --> 02:15:31,890
I believe.

3431
02:15:31,990 --> 02:15:32,590
I believe.

3432
02:15:32,590 --> 02:15:33,610
The drama.

3433
02:15:38,170 --> 02:15:39,030
It worked!

3434
02:15:39,730 --> 02:15:41,170
That's a really good one.

3435
02:15:41,710 --> 02:15:42,430
Thank you.

3436
02:15:43,770 --> 02:15:44,890
That's a nice one.

3437
02:15:45,130 --> 02:15:45,950
OK, that's good.

3438
02:15:46,130 --> 02:15:46,990
That's a good one.

3439
02:15:50,930 --> 02:15:51,450
What?

3440
02:15:52,110 --> 02:15:53,270
Is that not a double?

3441
02:15:54,770 --> 02:15:56,570
That should be enough, I think.

3442
02:15:57,150 --> 02:15:58,310
Hell yeah, we made it.

3443
02:15:58,430 --> 02:15:59,430
We made it!

3444
02:16:01,770 --> 02:16:04,490
Oh my god, we made it.

3445
02:16:04,610 --> 02:16:05,490
Both selfies.

3446
02:16:05,650 --> 02:16:06,390
God, look at that.

3447
02:16:06,690 --> 02:16:10,630
Guys, three out of four are headliners.

3448
02:16:10,650 --> 02:16:13,010
I personally like this one better than this one.

3449
02:16:15,450 --> 02:16:17,210
Yeah, I actually like that one.

3450
02:16:17,310 --> 02:16:18,310
Yeah, that one was good.

3451
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:22,210
Do you want to do a flashy camera?

3452
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:25,030
There's also an SD camera that gives you 15 pictures.

3453
02:16:25,650 --> 02:16:26,530
Which is pretty hot.

3454
02:16:26,530 --> 02:16:28,250
I feel like more photos is good.

3455
02:16:28,250 --> 02:16:29,490
Sure, OK.

3456
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:31,530
We have $200.

3457
02:16:31,970 --> 02:16:32,810
What do you want to spend it on?

3458
02:16:33,230 --> 02:16:37,010
Another camera or some normal flashlights?

3459
02:16:38,210 --> 02:16:39,490
Oh, bravery.

3460
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:41,170
We could give each other helmets.

3461
02:16:41,430 --> 02:16:43,250
We could spend two helmets for health.

3462
02:16:43,890 --> 02:16:44,970
How do you see what the points are?

3463
02:16:45,530 --> 02:16:46,210
Oh, I see it.

3464
02:16:46,990 --> 02:16:48,590
You know what, I'm going to order some helmets.

3465
02:16:48,850 --> 02:16:51,470
Because you know when you get attacked by a bad creature that eats your leg?

3466
02:16:51,550 --> 02:16:53,630
I think having a helmet on will save your life.

3467
02:16:54,070 --> 02:16:55,470
Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

3468
02:16:55,690 --> 02:16:57,150
It's basically the same body part.

3469
02:16:58,650 --> 02:17:00,270
Wait, you want me to wear the helmet?

3470
02:17:00,910 --> 02:17:01,630
We got the helmet.

3471
02:17:02,430 --> 02:17:05,190
Wait, you don't just wear the helmet.

3472
02:17:06,330 --> 02:17:07,030
Oh no, you do.

3473
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:10,370
I think it's because it's an item that you have to hold to get the benefit.

3474
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:11,590
Oh, there it is.

3475
02:17:11,950 --> 02:17:12,670
Oh, it's on?

3476
02:17:13,050 --> 02:17:14,730
It's my special helmet.

3477
02:17:15,390 --> 02:17:16,450
Wait, you don't have it on.

3478
02:17:17,550 --> 02:17:18,510
Is mine on?

3479
02:17:18,630 --> 02:17:19,270
Yeah, yours is.

3480
02:17:19,310 --> 02:17:19,810
There's only two.

3481
02:17:20,050 --> 02:17:20,450
Oh, OK.

3482
02:17:20,630 --> 02:17:22,110
Well, you guys need the most.

3483
02:17:23,270 --> 02:17:23,670
Me?

3484
02:17:23,970 --> 02:17:24,230
Really?

3485
02:17:25,830 --> 02:17:29,330
Yeah, Lime is the most responsible here.

3486
02:17:29,710 --> 02:17:32,110
So, we are the ones with the helmets.

3487
02:17:35,570 --> 02:17:38,090
OK, does someone have the camera that takes tons of pictures?

3488
02:17:38,610 --> 02:17:39,290
Wait, how do you...

3489
02:17:39,290 --> 02:17:39,650
Yeah, here.

3490
02:17:40,290 --> 02:17:40,790
You got it?

3491
02:17:40,890 --> 02:17:41,490
OK, that's fine.

3492
02:17:41,530 --> 02:17:41,930
You take it.

3493
02:17:42,210 --> 02:17:45,450
Just having it causes it to be yours.

3494
02:17:46,550 --> 02:17:47,870
Oh, is it on my head now?

3495
02:17:48,350 --> 02:17:48,710
No.

3496
02:17:48,950 --> 02:17:50,150
When you scroll off of it, it will be.

3497
02:17:51,250 --> 02:17:52,030
Yeah, there you go.

3498
02:17:52,110 --> 02:17:52,490
You're good.

3499
02:17:52,990 --> 02:17:53,770
Hey, guys.

3500
02:17:54,830 --> 02:17:56,850
My mom bought this helmet for me for the bus.

3501
02:17:58,050 --> 02:18:00,210
Wait, before we go, I need to use the bathroom.

3502
02:18:00,730 --> 02:18:01,830
I've been hydrating.

3503
02:18:02,190 --> 02:18:02,490
OK.

3504
02:18:03,110 --> 02:18:03,950
I'll be right back.

3505
02:18:04,130 --> 02:18:04,390
OK.

3506
02:18:07,110 --> 02:18:07,950
Push her in.

3507
02:18:08,850 --> 02:18:09,670
Is it Thursday?

3508
02:18:09,790 --> 02:18:11,270
No, it's Wednesday today, isn't it?

3509
02:18:11,290 --> 02:18:11,870
It's Wednesday, yeah.

3510
02:18:13,010 --> 02:18:17,530
My sense of time is all messed up because I've been sick, I've not been streaming on my normal day.

3511
02:18:17,590 --> 02:18:18,770
So, I'm like, what day is it?

3512
02:18:19,270 --> 02:18:21,070
Are you getting proper rest?

3513
02:18:22,550 --> 02:18:27,690
No, I spend most of the time trying to sleep and then not being able to sleep because I can't breathe.

3514
02:18:28,070 --> 02:18:31,570
And then falling asleep because I'm so tired, so it's like all over the place.

3515
02:18:31,810 --> 02:18:33,430
Yeah, it's the worst.

3516
02:18:35,790 --> 02:18:42,810
I have like no concept of time anymore because I'll try and go to bed and then I'll lie there from like 2am to 9am.

3517
02:18:43,230 --> 02:18:45,170
And I'm so tired and I didn't get any sleep.

3518
02:18:45,270 --> 02:18:50,830
And then I'll get up and I'll go and sit down in a chair and I'll fall asleep in the chair instead for three hours.

3519
02:18:50,830 --> 02:18:53,970
And then I wake up and it's 6pm and I'm like, what the fuck?

3520
02:18:54,070 --> 02:18:58,010
But if you're in the chair, you're like sitting up, maybe that helps your nose not be so...

3521
02:18:58,010 --> 02:19:02,470
Yeah, no, when I'm sitting up, I'm less clogged, so it's nicer, I think.

3522
02:19:04,390 --> 02:19:05,790
You sound terrible.

3523
02:19:07,030 --> 02:19:07,430
Thanks.

3524
02:19:09,210 --> 02:19:11,910
Yeah, I was sick not too long ago, I get it.

3525
02:19:12,650 --> 02:19:13,450
It was rough.

3526
02:19:13,470 --> 02:19:14,390
Hello, I'm back.

3527
02:19:14,490 --> 02:19:15,150
Welcome back.

3528
02:19:15,350 --> 02:19:16,390
Did you wash your hands?

3529
02:19:16,690 --> 02:19:17,930
Yeah, I washed my hands.

3530
02:19:18,110 --> 02:19:18,490
Thanks, mom.

3531
02:19:18,490 --> 02:19:19,390
I'm so proud of you.

3532
02:19:19,390 --> 02:19:22,850
There are the two daughters that needs the helmet.

3533
02:19:28,690 --> 02:19:30,130
Times Square-ish.

3534
02:19:30,250 --> 02:19:31,250
Wait, is this a new location?

3535
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:34,570
It's back to Times Square, but it's more dangerous.

3536
02:19:35,670 --> 02:19:37,370
God, you look like my...

3537
02:19:37,370 --> 02:19:41,390
My two kids where I don't trust you enough to have your safety helmets on.

3538
02:19:41,770 --> 02:19:43,590
Yeah, we have the leashes on too.

3539
02:19:44,310 --> 02:19:45,950
The harnesses and everything.

3540
02:19:46,950 --> 02:19:49,230
Oh my God, mom, there's...

3541
02:19:50,170 --> 02:19:50,750
What?

3542
02:19:52,470 --> 02:19:53,290
He died already!

3543
02:19:53,910 --> 02:19:54,330
How?

3544
02:19:56,870 --> 02:19:58,210
Did you just...

3545
02:19:58,210 --> 02:19:58,710
How?

3546
02:19:59,150 --> 02:20:01,510
You were alive for three seconds.

3547
02:20:01,510 --> 02:20:03,530
Well, kid helmet is mine now.

3548
02:20:04,170 --> 02:20:06,010
I ran into a car.

3549
02:20:06,010 --> 02:20:07,170
I saw...

3550
02:20:14,310 --> 02:20:16,250
Was the car moving?

3551
02:20:18,770 --> 02:20:21,910
I got run over by a parked car.

3552
02:20:22,430 --> 02:20:25,110
I wonder if something is like underneath the cars.

3553
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:27,150
I don't think there was.

3554
02:20:27,230 --> 02:20:29,690
I think she literally just got physics to death.

3555
02:20:29,770 --> 02:20:33,390
You know like Source games where something is like vibrating and it causes...

3556
02:20:33,390 --> 02:20:34,590
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3557
02:20:34,590 --> 02:20:36,030
Velocity collision damage.

3558
02:20:36,150 --> 02:20:37,470
I think she did that with a car.

3559
02:20:37,810 --> 02:20:38,170
Oopsie.

3560
02:20:40,850 --> 02:20:42,390
Well, that's not great for us.

3561
02:20:42,450 --> 02:20:43,070
Let's go in here.

3562
02:20:43,210 --> 02:20:43,890
It'll be funny.

3563
02:20:45,110 --> 02:20:45,570
That's a horrible sound.

3564
02:20:45,570 --> 02:20:46,650
Why is it making creepy noises?

3565
02:20:46,650 --> 02:20:47,010
I don't know.

3566
02:20:47,070 --> 02:20:48,810
I was gonna say it's a horrible noise.

3567
02:20:50,270 --> 02:20:51,970
Oh God, every time.

3568
02:20:52,430 --> 02:20:54,290
Mint, do you want the special camera Doki had?

3569
02:20:54,410 --> 02:20:56,250
Because I've got the flashlight, so here you go.

3570
02:20:56,310 --> 02:20:57,490
OK, if you trust me with that.

3571
02:20:57,490 --> 02:20:58,090
I take more photos.

3572
02:20:58,590 --> 02:20:59,850
I trust you with it.

3573
02:20:59,930 --> 02:21:00,450
It'll be great.

3574
02:21:00,550 --> 02:21:01,610
Oh, we're in the same room as...

3575
02:21:01,610 --> 02:21:03,770
What the fuck?

3576
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:04,990
Oh, hey, Cthulhu.

3577
02:21:05,470 --> 02:21:06,130
Oh, sorry, Beholder.

3578
02:21:06,270 --> 02:21:07,310
I get them mixed up sometimes.

3579
02:21:08,430 --> 02:21:09,050
That guy.

3580
02:21:10,510 --> 02:21:11,890
Who else is in here?

3581
02:21:13,630 --> 02:21:14,030
Hello?

3582
02:21:15,370 --> 02:21:16,030
Oh, look.

3583
02:21:16,750 --> 02:21:17,770
Wait, I hear something.

3584
02:21:17,770 --> 02:21:17,810
Goop.

3585
02:21:19,050 --> 02:21:19,450
Where?

3586
02:21:19,890 --> 02:21:20,290
Goop.

3587
02:21:21,410 --> 02:21:21,710
Where?

3588
02:21:21,970 --> 02:21:22,570
Oh, right there.

3589
02:21:23,070 --> 02:21:23,890
You wanna pose in front of it?

3590
02:21:25,030 --> 02:21:27,430
Sure, I'm just trying to figure out what that weird bleeping noise is.

3591
02:21:27,490 --> 02:21:28,550
I know, that's what I'm wondering.

3592
02:21:31,210 --> 02:21:32,430
OK, anyway, hold on.

3593
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:36,470
Oh, that's not terrifying at all.

3594
02:21:38,650 --> 02:21:40,110
Oh my god.

3595
02:21:41,830 --> 02:21:42,430
Holy...

3596
02:21:42,430 --> 02:21:44,110
Oh my god.

3597
02:21:45,970 --> 02:21:47,490
What the hell?

3598
02:21:50,110 --> 02:21:50,710
Cool.

3599
02:21:52,610 --> 02:21:54,510
I'll follow wherever you wanna go.

3600
02:21:56,310 --> 02:21:58,190
Wait, is it... I think it's that.

3601
02:21:58,290 --> 02:21:59,250
Oh my gosh, it's a mine.

3602
02:21:59,950 --> 02:22:01,250
Oh, there are mines.

3603
02:22:01,250 --> 02:22:03,570
Because we're truly the most lethal of companies right now.

3604
02:22:03,690 --> 02:22:03,710
Yeah.

3605
02:22:05,190 --> 02:22:06,210
OK, interesting.

3606
02:22:06,590 --> 02:22:08,070
So there's a couple in here.

3607
02:22:10,630 --> 02:22:11,070
Oh,

3608
02:22:18,950 --> 02:22:20,990
I wanna sneeze like constantly.

3609
02:22:21,190 --> 02:22:21,970
It's fucking awful.

3610
02:22:22,370 --> 02:22:22,710
Sneeze.

3611
02:22:22,730 --> 02:22:24,170
Oh, there's a dude being eaten.

3612
02:22:24,350 --> 02:22:25,230
Oh yeah, there is.

3613
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:30,230
I think we're gonna stick pose in front of it because of the height.

3614
02:22:31,170 --> 02:22:32,870
Yeah, let's get us both in there.

3615
02:22:34,810 --> 02:22:36,230
Oh, there's a guy in here for sure.

3616
02:22:37,770 --> 02:22:38,090
Oh.

3617
02:22:38,370 --> 02:22:39,830
It's just a boulder.

3618
02:22:40,790 --> 02:22:41,470
Did you get a good picture?

3619
02:22:41,830 --> 02:22:42,570
Oh, he's coming up!

3620
02:22:42,670 --> 02:22:43,130
He's coming up!

3621
02:22:44,390 --> 02:22:45,450
Hey, what's up?

3622
02:22:46,470 --> 02:22:47,290
I got you both.

3623
02:22:48,090 --> 02:22:49,350
I don't know what he got.

3624
02:22:51,310 --> 02:22:56,890
No, I mean, I get weird music when he looks at me, so maybe if you let him stare at you too long, bad stuff happens.

3625
02:22:57,090 --> 02:22:57,350
Oh, maybe.

3626
02:22:58,390 --> 02:23:04,370
I think, I kinda remember boulders, if you look at them, you go nuts, so maybe just, I don't know, don't stare at him.

3627
02:23:04,390 --> 02:23:05,250
Oh, he's up there too.

3628
02:23:05,810 --> 02:23:08,490
Oh, yeah, I'm starting to get the weird music or something weird.

3629
02:23:10,010 --> 02:23:11,430
My vision's starting to go funky.

3630
02:23:13,510 --> 02:23:14,350
What a dick.

3631
02:23:15,470 --> 02:23:16,430
Yeah, go away.

3632
02:23:16,890 --> 02:23:19,030
Oh, there's some goop I will overhear.

3633
02:23:19,550 --> 02:23:20,950
And that's a trap right there?

3634
02:23:21,410 --> 02:23:21,830
Or was?

3635
02:23:22,030 --> 02:23:22,670
I can't tell.

3636
02:23:22,730 --> 02:23:23,890
There's a goopy thing there too.

3637
02:23:25,550 --> 02:23:26,230
Sick, sick, sick.

3638
02:23:26,690 --> 02:23:27,530
I hear something.

3639
02:23:28,350 --> 02:23:28,670
Yeah.

3640
02:23:29,550 --> 02:23:32,250
I hear something mouth-breathing.

3641
02:23:35,050 --> 02:23:36,070
Oh, there's a mine in here.

3642
02:23:37,570 --> 02:23:39,630
Oh, wait, no, this is where we, I think this is where we started?

3643
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:42,270
Is this back where we started?

3644
02:23:43,470 --> 02:23:44,790
I can't see anything.

3645
02:23:45,930 --> 02:23:46,770
I don't know.

3646
02:23:47,330 --> 02:23:47,810
Oh, wow.

3647
02:23:47,810 --> 02:23:49,070
Wait, what the fuck?

3648
02:23:49,430 --> 02:23:50,110
This is a door to...

3649
02:23:50,110 --> 02:23:52,190
Turn around, look, impossible geometry.

3650
02:23:53,230 --> 02:23:54,930
It's a literal suicide door.

3651
02:23:55,490 --> 02:23:57,730
Okay, that's perfect for this moment.

3652
02:23:58,410 --> 02:24:01,330
How many pictures did you get?

3653
02:24:01,450 --> 02:24:04,270
Do you think we should just go outside and take some pictures of the carnage outside?

3654
02:24:04,490 --> 02:24:06,070
I have 8 out of 15 left.

3655
02:24:07,470 --> 02:24:07,910
So...

3656
02:24:07,910 --> 02:24:08,470
Pretty nice.

3657
02:24:08,690 --> 02:24:10,110
I know, I got, we got...

3658
02:24:10,110 --> 02:24:12,470
I got tons of camera things to do.

3659
02:24:12,570 --> 02:24:12,570
Is there anything in here?

3660
02:24:12,610 --> 02:24:14,150
Let me see if the mine does anything.

3661
02:24:15,790 --> 02:24:19,150
Oh, yeah, you do get points for the mine, not a lot, but...

3662
02:24:21,190 --> 02:24:22,930
Is there anything in here?

3663
02:24:25,010 --> 02:24:25,510
Besides...

3664
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:27,050
Mines and the beholding?

3665
02:24:27,410 --> 02:24:30,350
Oh, there's another headcrab thingy.

3666
02:24:30,450 --> 02:24:31,390
Oh, great.

3667
02:24:31,690 --> 02:24:33,590
Or, you know, like a head muncher.

3668
02:24:36,750 --> 02:24:38,610
Do you hear an air raid siren?

3669
02:24:38,870 --> 02:24:39,250
Yes.

3670
02:24:40,190 --> 02:24:40,790
Okay, then.

3671
02:24:41,230 --> 02:24:42,690
That doesn't sound very good.

3672
02:24:44,810 --> 02:24:45,370
Hello?

3673
02:24:46,470 --> 02:24:47,390
Is it coming from the...

3674
02:24:47,390 --> 02:24:49,850
Do you think there's something sweet outside as a result?

3675
02:24:50,530 --> 02:24:52,170
Oh, could be.

3676
02:24:53,090 --> 02:24:54,310
I'm gonna go look.

3677
02:24:54,330 --> 02:24:55,130
Yeah, let's go look.

3678
02:24:57,270 --> 02:24:59,610
That's our sign to be real journalists.

3679
02:24:59,850 --> 02:25:00,710
Holy shit!

3680
02:25:01,490 --> 02:25:02,950
Oh, what the hell is that?

3681
02:25:10,010 --> 02:25:11,410
Oh, where's the...

3682
02:25:11,990 --> 02:25:13,190
Which way is the...

3683
02:25:13,190 --> 02:25:13,710
Oh, that way.

3684
02:25:13,810 --> 02:25:16,030
My fucking god is staring at me.

3685
02:25:17,130 --> 02:25:18,190
Oh, he's staring at...

3686
02:25:19,610 --> 02:25:20,390
Oh, wow.

3687
02:25:21,010 --> 02:25:22,810
He's tossing shit at us, what a dick.

3688
02:25:22,890 --> 02:25:23,210
Yeah.

3689
02:25:23,510 --> 02:25:25,890
Oh, that's nice.

3690
02:25:27,130 --> 02:25:27,770
There's a car.

3691
02:25:29,310 --> 02:25:30,150
That's good.

3692
02:25:30,710 --> 02:25:35,110
We could just hang out here and take some pictures and then whoever dies first, you pick up their camera and just leave.

3693
02:25:35,470 --> 02:25:35,870
True.

3694
02:25:36,930 --> 02:25:39,070
There's like... Is there anything else around here?

3695
02:25:39,250 --> 02:25:39,450
No?

3696
02:25:40,010 --> 02:25:44,690
No, there's a dude running towards the tornado which is like an interesting battle strategy.

3697
02:25:44,810 --> 02:25:46,190
I don't know how that's gonna work out for him.

3698
02:25:46,390 --> 02:25:47,530
Great survival instincts.

3699
02:25:50,530 --> 02:25:52,330
I'm gonna get closer to it.

3700
02:25:53,610 --> 02:25:56,410
Ok, maybe you could pose or something and I'll take a picture of you.

3701
02:25:57,570 --> 02:25:58,050
I'm posing.

3702
02:25:58,670 --> 02:25:59,390
I'm posing.

3703
02:25:59,930 --> 02:26:00,370
I'm posing.

3704
02:26:00,910 --> 02:26:01,810
Turn back towards me.

3705
02:26:01,950 --> 02:26:02,390
There we go.

3706
02:26:02,790 --> 02:26:03,510
Sick picture.

3707
02:26:05,630 --> 02:26:06,050
Alright.

3708
02:26:09,450 --> 02:26:10,370
There's a monster.

3709
02:26:10,530 --> 02:26:12,330
There's like a selfie monster over there.

3710
02:26:12,390 --> 02:26:13,310
Oh, there's a couple actually.

3711
02:26:14,710 --> 02:26:15,570
His name is Clubby.

3712
02:26:16,210 --> 02:26:16,530
Clubby.

3713
02:26:17,750 --> 02:26:19,030
Cause he's got a club.

3714
02:26:21,830 --> 02:26:22,930
Oh, he ran away.

3715
02:26:23,090 --> 02:26:23,410
What a bitch.

3716
02:26:23,730 --> 02:26:25,230
Oh, I got a lot of stuff in that picture.

3717
02:26:25,390 --> 02:26:25,890
Ok, nice.

3718
02:26:26,030 --> 02:26:27,210
I just wanted to selfie with him.

3719
02:26:30,330 --> 02:26:33,450
Well, I have two more so I guess I'll just take some...

3720
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:36,610
Yeah, I mean we can wait a couple more minutes.

3721
02:26:36,750 --> 02:26:38,650
See if anything cool shows up in the last minute or two.

3722
02:26:38,730 --> 02:26:39,610
This guy isn't very threatening.

3723
02:26:39,890 --> 02:26:40,250
No.

3724
02:26:41,090 --> 02:26:43,870
He's actively moving away from us while staring us down.

3725
02:26:44,190 --> 02:26:44,590
He's like...

3726
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:48,370
He looks like he should be so intimidating but nothing's happening.

3727
02:26:48,750 --> 02:26:51,430
Yeah, I mean it was really scary when we spawned right next to him.

3728
02:26:51,450 --> 02:26:52,930
And then he was like, oh, I'm sorry.

3729
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:54,090
I'll move for you.

3730
02:26:54,650 --> 02:26:56,190
Just get a vacuum, guys.

3731
02:26:56,310 --> 02:26:56,990
Come on.

3732
02:26:57,670 --> 02:26:58,490
Suck him up.

3733
02:26:58,930 --> 02:27:00,250
There's nobody here either.

3734
02:27:00,350 --> 02:27:01,110
It's just kinda chill.

3735
02:27:01,110 --> 02:27:03,490
Just be careful of the car that killed Doki, I guess.

3736
02:27:03,630 --> 02:27:04,250
Oh yeah, true.

3737
02:27:04,310 --> 02:27:05,850
Let me take a picture of her corpse.

3738
02:27:06,250 --> 02:27:07,750
The car casualty.

3739
02:27:09,490 --> 02:27:10,370
Hi Doki.

3740
02:27:10,630 --> 02:27:12,990
Are you still inhabiting your dead body over here?

3741
02:27:13,130 --> 02:27:13,450
Nice.

3742
02:27:15,570 --> 02:27:16,470
I'm out of photos.

3743
02:27:19,610 --> 02:27:21,510
I'm getting in because I'm out of photos.

3744
02:27:23,590 --> 02:27:24,470
Bye Doki.

3745
02:27:25,130 --> 02:27:26,090
We'll remember you.

3746
02:27:26,510 --> 02:27:30,010
I can take your corpse with us, actually.

3747
02:27:32,830 --> 02:27:34,850
Pequod, take us home.

3748
02:27:36,850 --> 02:27:38,490
I brought Doki with us.

3749
02:27:41,390 --> 02:27:42,910
Throw her into the tornado.

3750
02:27:45,990 --> 02:27:47,490
I don't... I didn't get Doki...

3751
02:27:49,410 --> 02:27:55,450
It was so fucking funny that we were like, man, you know, we gotta protect you with your safety helmet.

3752
02:27:55,710 --> 02:27:59,250
And then you walk into a stationary car and fucking die.

3753
02:27:59,730 --> 02:28:01,310
Use your helmet back, Doki.

3754
02:28:01,430 --> 02:28:01,750
Oh yeah.

3755
02:28:02,070 --> 02:28:03,910
I thought it was fun.

3756
02:28:07,350 --> 02:28:07,790
Nice.

3757
02:28:10,230 --> 02:28:11,770
That's a good photo.

3758
02:28:13,950 --> 02:28:14,810
Oh god.

3759
02:28:16,370 --> 02:28:17,930
Oh, look how cute I am.

3760
02:28:18,090 --> 02:28:20,730
Pequod's just selfies of you as a big guy.

3761
02:28:21,510 --> 02:28:23,010
I mean, he was really considerate.

3762
02:28:23,070 --> 02:28:24,630
He just chilled and let us do anything.

3763
02:28:24,830 --> 02:28:25,630
Yeah, he was really chill.

3764
02:28:25,750 --> 02:28:26,230
That's a good one.

3765
02:28:26,390 --> 02:28:26,870
That photo's good.

3766
02:28:26,870 --> 02:28:27,910
That's a really cool one.

3767
02:28:30,550 --> 02:28:31,510
Woo woo!

3768
02:28:32,610 --> 02:28:33,870
Oh, 4,000.

3769
02:28:34,150 --> 02:28:34,370
Wow.

3770
02:28:34,570 --> 02:28:36,390
50% of it on the first run.

3771
02:28:36,490 --> 02:28:36,730
Yeah.

3772
02:28:37,170 --> 02:28:38,930
Your helmet's back by the desk, Doki.

3773
02:28:40,110 --> 02:28:42,570
Okay, this helmet's made out of plastic.

3774
02:28:42,690 --> 02:28:43,350
There's no way.

3775
02:28:44,790 --> 02:28:45,890
There's no way.

3776
02:28:46,710 --> 02:28:47,270
I don't know.

3777
02:28:47,530 --> 02:28:49,390
You're made out of plastic, maybe.

3778
02:28:49,930 --> 02:28:51,270
Wait, who has the blue camera?

3779
02:28:52,030 --> 02:28:53,310
Oh, it's right here.

3780
02:28:53,550 --> 02:28:54,130
It's right there.

3781
02:28:54,470 --> 02:28:55,110
It respawned.

3782
02:28:55,890 --> 02:28:57,470
Oh yeah, it respawned.

3783
02:28:57,530 --> 02:28:57,890
There you go.

3784
02:28:58,790 --> 02:29:00,410
Alright, I'll use it then.

3785
02:29:00,530 --> 02:29:00,750
Yeah.

3786
02:29:02,050 --> 02:29:03,210
Alright, let's go.

3787
02:29:03,930 --> 02:29:06,550
Now I know cars are dangerous no matter what.

3788
02:29:07,350 --> 02:29:09,150
Never get in a car, guys.

3789
02:29:09,250 --> 02:29:10,570
Never get on top of a car.

3790
02:29:10,790 --> 02:29:12,230
Cars, not even ones.

3791
02:29:12,670 --> 02:29:13,450
Don't do it.

3792
02:29:13,790 --> 02:29:14,270
Cars.

3793
02:29:15,830 --> 02:29:16,630
Square-ish.

3794
02:29:16,750 --> 02:29:17,510
I like that guy.

3795
02:29:17,570 --> 02:29:18,290
He was easy, though.

3796
02:29:22,730 --> 02:29:23,570
Stop coughing.

3797
02:29:23,810 --> 02:29:26,090
I'm pretty sure you bought this helmet from a kid's section.

3798
02:29:28,190 --> 02:29:29,730
Oh, I hear something already.

3799
02:29:30,650 --> 02:29:31,090
Yeah.

3800
02:29:32,750 --> 02:29:33,810
Raki the raccoon!

3801
02:29:36,170 --> 02:29:40,030
Hey mister, did you know if you chat with me, you can get a good deal on your vehicle insurance?

3802
02:29:40,710 --> 02:29:43,050
Don't say I didn't do nothing for you.

3803
02:29:43,070 --> 02:29:44,070
Is there something over here?

3804
02:29:44,850 --> 02:29:48,630
I'm curious if we just stay outside the whole time, how things start appearing.

3805
02:29:48,990 --> 02:29:49,850
If they do, at least.

3806
02:29:49,930 --> 02:29:50,390
Like, you know?

3807
02:29:51,050 --> 02:29:51,970
Oh, that's true.

3808
02:29:52,150 --> 02:29:52,550
I wonder.

3809
02:29:52,550 --> 02:29:52,950
That's good.

3810
02:29:55,870 --> 02:29:57,010
There's a building.

3811
02:29:57,410 --> 02:29:57,610
Do you see?

3812
02:29:57,990 --> 02:30:01,050
Someone should go and camp that building and take really cool aerial shots.

3813
02:30:01,170 --> 02:30:02,190
Do you see that ladder over there?

3814
02:30:02,310 --> 02:30:02,650
Oh yeah!

3815
02:30:03,170 --> 02:30:04,230
Yeah, I can do that.

3816
02:30:04,250 --> 02:30:05,910
Wait, there's also a door over here.

3817
02:30:06,450 --> 02:30:07,250
Yeah, there is.

3818
02:30:07,450 --> 02:30:07,630
Best to be used.

3819
02:30:07,630 --> 02:30:14,450
So someone stay outside and the other people get photos just in case, like, something terrible happens when you just camp outside and we lose the run.

3820
02:30:17,330 --> 02:30:17,730
Explosion!

3821
02:30:19,350 --> 02:30:20,430
I'll stay outside.

3822
02:30:20,750 --> 02:30:21,590
Of course you will.

3823
02:30:24,090 --> 02:30:25,250
Come on, mid.

3824
02:30:25,310 --> 02:30:26,410
Let's go be brave.

3825
02:30:26,690 --> 02:30:28,350
Yeah, let's go do actual jobs.

3826
02:30:31,110 --> 02:30:32,190
She's screaming out.

3827
02:30:32,190 --> 02:30:33,230
She's yelling at us.

3828
02:30:33,370 --> 02:30:34,050
Yeah, she is.

3829
02:30:34,810 --> 02:30:36,630
Alright, let's see what we got in here.

3830
02:30:37,710 --> 02:30:38,750
Death, probably.

3831
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:39,550
Probably.

3832
02:30:40,630 --> 02:30:40,910
Hello!

3833
02:30:42,270 --> 02:30:42,710
Hello!

3834
02:30:43,070 --> 02:30:45,350
This is the first layout we ever had, I think.

3835
02:30:45,490 --> 02:30:47,390
I remember that head on the stairs.

3836
02:30:47,690 --> 02:30:48,810
Oh yeah, I think you're right.

3837
02:30:49,710 --> 02:30:50,590
It's like...

3838
02:30:50,590 --> 02:30:51,230
Oh, hey.

3839
02:30:51,230 --> 02:30:51,650
Oh.

3840
02:30:51,870 --> 02:30:52,430
What's going on?

3841
02:30:54,110 --> 02:30:55,310
Oh, there's something behind us?

3842
02:30:58,050 --> 02:30:59,770
Yeah, it sounds like there's a lot of stuff in here.

3843
02:30:59,850 --> 02:31:01,110
Yeah, it sounds creepy.

3844
02:31:01,110 --> 02:31:02,250
I don't really understand the beholder.

3845
02:31:02,410 --> 02:31:03,950
You get, like, fuck all points for him, too.

3846
02:31:04,070 --> 02:31:04,510
Where'd you go?

3847
02:31:04,670 --> 02:31:05,130
Oh, there you are.

3848
02:31:05,430 --> 02:31:06,070
I'm here, I'm here.

3849
02:31:06,370 --> 02:31:08,050
There's a creepy-crawly at the end of the card.

3850
02:31:08,190 --> 02:31:09,530
There's something around here.

3851
02:31:10,210 --> 02:31:11,490
Oh, that's the beholder again.

3852
02:31:11,510 --> 02:31:11,830
Oh, damn it.

3853
02:31:11,930 --> 02:31:12,830
Oh, it's a headcrab.

3854
02:31:12,950 --> 02:31:13,970
I'm gonna try and get a picture.

3855
02:31:14,590 --> 02:31:15,310
Oh, and the baby.

3856
02:31:15,630 --> 02:31:16,670
The baby here, too?

3857
02:31:17,090 --> 02:31:18,450
The baby, you need the flashlight.

3858
02:31:19,370 --> 02:31:20,170
Oh, I see him.

3859
02:31:22,510 --> 02:31:24,890
If I get hit by the headcrab, you need to knock it off of me.

3860
02:31:24,970 --> 02:31:25,850
You just walk up and press E.

3861
02:31:25,990 --> 02:31:26,190
Okay.

3862
02:31:29,890 --> 02:31:33,010
If you wanna get in, like, between them and emo...

3863
02:31:36,490 --> 02:31:37,030
It's me!

3864
02:31:38,490 --> 02:31:39,010
I got you.

3865
02:31:39,250 --> 02:31:40,810
I got a picture of him jumping on me.

3866
02:31:41,150 --> 02:31:41,670
Oh, watch out.

3867
02:31:42,130 --> 02:31:42,970
This guy's being aggressive.

3868
02:31:44,450 --> 02:31:44,990
Oh, God!

3869
02:31:45,170 --> 02:31:45,950
It's the leg biting!

3870
02:31:46,470 --> 02:31:46,930
What's happening?

3871
02:31:47,190 --> 02:31:47,350
Oh!

3872
02:31:47,810 --> 02:31:48,470
What the shit?

3873
02:31:51,770 --> 02:31:52,370
Um...

3874
02:31:55,670 --> 02:31:56,270
Uh...

3875
02:31:56,270 --> 02:31:58,610
Maybe we don't mess with that guy.

3876
02:31:59,910 --> 02:32:00,690
Holy shit.

3877
02:32:03,570 --> 02:32:07,510
Oh, my God!

3878
02:32:07,670 --> 02:32:09,590
My body won't stop splatting.

3879
02:32:09,690 --> 02:32:10,690
This is so annoying.

3880
02:32:15,690 --> 02:32:16,290
No.

3881
02:32:16,670 --> 02:32:17,530
100% not.

3882
02:32:17,690 --> 02:32:19,470
Goodbye, what?

3883
02:32:22,930 --> 02:32:24,330
Oh, Doki doesn't know.

3884
02:32:24,410 --> 02:32:25,390
What do you mean by that?

3885
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:27,170
We're so safe.

3886
02:32:28,850 --> 02:32:30,050
Doki doesn't know.

3887
02:32:30,290 --> 02:32:30,850
Hold six minutes.

3888
02:32:30,890 --> 02:32:31,830
Doki doesn't know.

3889
02:32:31,830 --> 02:32:32,990
She lacks critical information.

3890
02:32:33,010 --> 02:32:33,730
Look at all your peers, though.

3891
02:32:35,390 --> 02:32:36,990
There's, like, gunshots here.

3892
02:32:38,150 --> 02:32:39,110
There's, like...

3893
02:32:39,110 --> 02:32:41,310
She's got the easiest job in the world right now.

3894
02:32:42,490 --> 02:32:43,310
Oh, my God.

3895
02:32:43,410 --> 02:32:44,950
I can't even be by my body.

3896
02:32:45,030 --> 02:32:46,070
It's so annoying sounding.

3897
02:32:46,770 --> 02:32:48,750
That's when you know I got the experience.

3898
02:32:48,750 --> 02:32:52,110
I left the room because it was doing, like, source physics glitch noises.

3899
02:32:52,210 --> 02:32:53,830
I was like, no, I'm gonna go hang out with Doki.

3900
02:32:54,510 --> 02:32:54,870
I know.

3901
02:32:55,170 --> 02:32:57,350
I'm gonna tell her to go get our cameras.

3902
02:32:59,130 --> 02:33:01,770
I don't know if she can hear us if she's not by our dead bodies.

3903
02:33:03,130 --> 02:33:04,830
Hey, go get our cameras.

3904
02:33:07,130 --> 02:33:08,850
I feel like I hear a ghost right now.

3905
02:33:09,070 --> 02:33:09,410
Oh, my God.

3906
02:33:09,870 --> 02:33:13,150
For some reason, when I jumped back in here, it blew up again.

3907
02:33:13,770 --> 02:33:13,990
What?

3908
02:33:15,170 --> 02:33:15,530
Oh.

3909
02:33:15,650 --> 02:33:16,030
I don't know.

3910
02:33:18,190 --> 02:33:19,070
I still...

3911
02:33:19,070 --> 02:33:21,230
I can see under the world map.

3912
02:33:21,290 --> 02:33:21,770
Oh, my God.

3913
02:33:22,270 --> 02:33:24,030
I think as I'm colliding with the floor...

3914
02:33:24,830 --> 02:33:26,110
I don't know what's going on.

3915
02:33:29,650 --> 02:33:30,710
Oh, my God.

3916
02:33:30,810 --> 02:33:32,230
The fuck is that?

3917
02:33:32,890 --> 02:33:34,270
Oh, is that the alien dog?

3918
02:33:34,770 --> 02:33:35,750
Oh, it's fast.

3919
02:33:36,730 --> 02:33:37,430
Oh, what is that?

3920
02:33:37,710 --> 02:33:37,750
Oh, shit.

3921
02:33:39,410 --> 02:33:40,710
Okay, but where's the tornado?

3922
02:33:41,370 --> 02:33:42,710
Doki, go get our cameras.

3923
02:33:42,710 --> 02:33:42,930
Guys.

3924
02:33:45,590 --> 02:33:49,270
I got such a good shot of the crab jumping at me.

3925
02:33:49,830 --> 02:33:51,350
She's never gonna get those cameras.

3926
02:33:53,270 --> 02:33:56,230
It's one of those special as well, I think, or at least a helmet or something.

3927
02:33:58,070 --> 02:33:58,770
Something's happening.

3928
02:33:59,570 --> 02:34:00,430
That's the tornado.

3929
02:34:00,670 --> 02:34:01,610
That's the air raid siren.

3930
02:34:02,150 --> 02:34:02,570
Oh, yeah.

3931
02:34:02,690 --> 02:34:03,090
You're right.

3932
02:34:04,190 --> 02:34:07,790
Or alternatively, it's meteors from the sky and Doki's about to fucking die.

3933
02:34:07,990 --> 02:34:09,130
Oh, he spawned.

3934
02:34:12,710 --> 02:34:13,230
He's watching.

3935
02:34:13,250 --> 02:34:14,030
There he is.

3936
02:34:14,590 --> 02:34:15,430
It's time to go.

3937
02:34:17,090 --> 02:34:18,050
Don't drop.

3938
02:34:18,050 --> 02:34:19,290
Doki, get our cameras, you coward.

3939
02:34:19,570 --> 02:34:20,430
Get our cameras.

3940
02:34:21,590 --> 02:34:23,190
Get our cameras, Doki.

3941
02:34:23,810 --> 02:34:24,290
Doki.

3942
02:34:24,290 --> 02:34:25,130
Don't be scared.

3943
02:34:27,350 --> 02:34:28,250
Don't be scared.

3944
02:34:30,170 --> 02:34:30,930
Come on.

3945
02:34:32,430 --> 02:34:33,170
Oh, there's the other.

3946
02:34:35,030 --> 02:34:35,790
Come on.

3947
02:34:35,990 --> 02:34:36,510
Don't worry.

3948
02:34:36,590 --> 02:34:37,690
I'm gonna be the hero.

3949
02:34:38,150 --> 02:34:39,170
And get our cameras, right?

3950
02:34:39,810 --> 02:34:42,190
As soon as I figure out how to get down from here.

3951
02:34:42,790 --> 02:34:43,730
Yeah, you got this.

3952
02:34:44,990 --> 02:34:46,090
She's not gonna do it.

3953
02:34:46,150 --> 02:34:46,730
I don't think so.

3954
02:34:46,830 --> 02:34:47,330
It's OK.

3955
02:34:48,070 --> 02:34:49,410
Oh, she's running away from it.

3956
02:34:49,430 --> 02:34:51,550
I'm gonna be the last one alive.

3957
02:34:51,670 --> 02:34:52,490
She's running away.

3958
02:34:52,750 --> 02:34:53,330
That's right.

3959
02:34:53,490 --> 02:34:55,210
It's your turn to watch me.

3960
02:34:55,390 --> 02:34:55,810
No!

3961
02:34:57,590 --> 02:34:58,450
I can't.

3962
02:34:58,450 --> 02:35:00,290
My picture of the headcrab.

3963
02:35:01,710 --> 02:35:03,630
He was launching at me.

3964
02:35:05,450 --> 02:35:05,750
Cool.

3965
02:35:06,470 --> 02:35:06,890
Alright.

3966
02:35:07,050 --> 02:35:07,350
Don't worry.

3967
02:35:07,350 --> 02:35:08,870
I got three more of these.

3968
02:35:12,560 --> 02:35:13,380
Don't worry.

3969
02:35:14,240 --> 02:35:15,880
I'm doing it for you guys.

3970
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:16,960
Wait for an explosion.

3971
02:35:20,080 --> 02:35:21,540
That would have been good.

3972
02:35:22,040 --> 02:35:22,800
That's good.

3973
02:35:23,080 --> 02:35:23,200
Alright.

3974
02:35:24,300 --> 02:35:26,280
It's so hard being me sometimes.

3975
02:35:26,700 --> 02:35:27,600
I did it.

3976
02:35:28,660 --> 02:35:30,680
It's so hard being me.

3977
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:44,200
I did it, guys.

3978
02:35:45,440 --> 02:35:45,960
Yeah.

3979
02:35:45,980 --> 02:35:47,760
What happened?

3980
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:51,300
We found out what the beholder does.

3981
02:35:51,380 --> 02:35:54,400
If he manages to get close enough to you when he spins, he explodes.

3982
02:35:54,700 --> 02:35:55,020
Yeah.

3983
02:35:55,340 --> 02:35:55,860
Oh!

3984
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:56,860
It's actually pretty great.

3985
02:35:56,860 --> 02:35:57,840
Wait, did you guys all explode?

3986
02:35:58,160 --> 02:35:59,720
Yeah, we both exploded together.

3987
02:36:00,200 --> 02:36:01,260
But you died!

3988
02:36:01,980 --> 02:36:03,640
Our cameras don't work.

3989
02:36:03,660 --> 02:36:03,920
Our cameras!

3990
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:06,040
Why did you get the cameras?

3991
02:36:09,560 --> 02:36:10,700
What a hero.

3992
02:36:11,800 --> 02:36:13,000
Don't worry, guys.

3993
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:14,960
I got us the photos we needed.

3994
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:16,620
Uh-huh.

3995
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:17,500
Oh, wow.

3996
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:18,260
Look at that.

3997
02:36:19,100 --> 02:36:19,700
277.

3998
02:36:19,880 --> 02:36:20,320
Oh, man.

3999
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:22,120
We're making numbers.

4000
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:22,640
Oh, man.

4001
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:23,380
Look at that.

4002
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:23,960
Yeah.

4003
02:36:24,140 --> 02:36:25,720
And then...

4004
02:36:25,720 --> 02:36:28,720
I like the ads in the background.

4005
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:29,280
I know.

4006
02:36:30,120 --> 02:36:32,340
It really adds to the dystopian levels.

4007
02:36:32,700 --> 02:36:33,980
They're all the same photo!

4008
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:36,100
They're all the same photo!

4009
02:36:37,160 --> 02:36:40,320
Turned fucking burst mode on and went AFK.

4010
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:44,100
Yeah, but I got us 3000 points, though.

4011
02:36:45,720 --> 02:36:47,120
Don't worry, everybody.

4012
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:49,460
We only need 500 points on the next one, I guess.

4013
02:36:49,560 --> 02:36:50,220
I think we'll get it.

4014
02:36:50,220 --> 02:36:51,700
No need to thank me, guys.

4015
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:52,460
Unless we all die.

4016
02:36:52,560 --> 02:36:55,060
I'm just being a hero that we deserve.

4017
02:36:57,640 --> 02:36:59,100
My pro flashlight!

4018
02:37:04,680 --> 02:37:05,400
Hey, guys.

4019
02:37:05,640 --> 02:37:06,900
We still have our SD camera.

4020
02:37:06,900 --> 02:37:08,180
I will remember this, Doki.

4021
02:37:08,380 --> 02:37:09,420
I will remember this.

4022
02:37:16,420 --> 02:37:19,260
I don't care how many points my headcrab picture was.

4023
02:37:19,300 --> 02:37:19,920
It was cool!

4024
02:37:20,260 --> 02:37:21,560
I wanted to see it!

4025
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,340
I had some cool photos, too, but I died.

4026
02:37:27,240 --> 02:37:29,580
We all died when we had some really cool photos.

4027
02:37:29,740 --> 02:37:31,020
You died to a car.

4028
02:37:31,140 --> 02:37:31,860
I don't want to hear it.

4029
02:37:31,880 --> 02:37:32,580
We are not the same.

4030
02:37:37,800 --> 02:37:38,680
Where should we go?

4031
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:40,820
It was a very scary car.

4032
02:37:43,120 --> 02:37:44,440
We can go back into the same place.

4033
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:45,140
Hold on.

4034
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:46,620
Can it just happen at any time?

4035
02:37:47,500 --> 02:37:48,060
No, but...

4036
02:37:48,060 --> 02:37:48,760
You did something special.

4037
02:37:48,840 --> 02:37:50,720
I just ran straight into that car and nothing happened.

4038
02:37:51,500 --> 02:37:52,380
Her body...

4039
02:37:52,380 --> 02:37:55,920
Her skin is made of paper and her bones are made of glass.

4040
02:37:57,540 --> 02:37:59,840
Yeah, my bones are very fragile.

4041
02:38:06,660 --> 02:38:09,440
That was like a scary car, right there.

4042
02:38:09,440 --> 02:38:09,840
Okay, okay.

4043
02:38:14,080 --> 02:38:15,060
It's so pretty!

4044
02:38:15,380 --> 02:38:16,140
Look at this!

4045
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:17,640
This is so awesome!

4046
02:38:18,860 --> 02:38:20,260
Wait, could we see the...

4047
02:38:20,260 --> 02:38:23,940
Could we see the guy spawn from inside here, I wonder?

4048
02:38:24,200 --> 02:38:25,160
I don't think so.

4049
02:38:25,700 --> 02:38:26,800
Can we just pull up in here?

4050
02:38:27,640 --> 02:38:30,060
Yeah, the siren basically says he spawns.

4051
02:38:30,080 --> 02:38:30,600
Suggie.

4052
02:38:30,960 --> 02:38:33,640
Everything makes me think of her.

4053
02:38:33,960 --> 02:38:34,480
Suggie.

4054
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:38,400
I like this layout.

4055
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:41,160
Yeah, I like it too.

4056
02:38:42,260 --> 02:38:42,720
Snow!

4057
02:38:46,620 --> 02:38:47,580
Which way do we go?

4058
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:49,580
We have no flashlight, so...

4059
02:38:50,520 --> 02:38:52,040
We have to look through our camera.

4060
02:38:54,220 --> 02:38:59,780
I'm gonna follow Mint because clearly she knows what she's doing and hasn't died multiple times.

4061
02:39:01,140 --> 02:39:02,460
I go in for...

4062
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:04,380
You know, I'm here for the scoop.

4063
02:39:04,620 --> 02:39:04,640
The thrill.

4064
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:06,140
The scoop of it all.

4065
02:39:07,320 --> 02:39:08,700
It might be chocolate.

4066
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:09,860
That's why she has a purple heart in journalism.

4067
02:39:10,620 --> 02:39:12,000
Purple heart in journalism.

4068
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:14,620
It's not chocolate, it's not vanilla.

4069
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:16,380
It's mint chocolate chip, baby.

4070
02:39:17,220 --> 02:39:18,320
That's the scoop.

4071
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:20,600
Oh, we just went in a big circle.

4072
02:39:22,760 --> 02:39:24,400
Oh yeah, it was really good.

4073
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:25,480
Great journalism, everybody.

4074
02:39:27,060 --> 02:39:27,620
Are we here?

4075
02:39:28,180 --> 02:39:29,760
I keep thinking that's an Enderman.

4076
02:39:32,620 --> 02:39:34,280
Oh wait, there's so much blood over here.

4077
02:39:37,260 --> 02:39:38,420
You hear the music?

4078
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:39,520
Yeah, I do too.

4079
02:39:39,700 --> 02:39:41,480
I don't hear music.

4080
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:42,140
It's like a...

4081
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:45,620
Wait, there's body parts here.

4082
02:39:46,540 --> 02:39:47,420
I don't hear music.

4083
02:39:47,560 --> 02:39:49,620
Are you guys having a mass hallucination right now?

4084
02:39:50,340 --> 02:39:51,340
Where do you see body parts?

4085
02:39:53,560 --> 02:39:54,920
Listen to the coffee.

4086
02:39:56,740 --> 02:39:58,860
Did you just say listen to the coffee?

4087
02:39:58,960 --> 02:40:00,060
That's what this says here.

4088
02:40:00,580 --> 02:40:02,060
Oh my god, the pizza!

4089
02:40:02,580 --> 02:40:04,800
You're advancing madness or some shit.

4090
02:40:04,820 --> 02:40:05,520
Pizza, pizza!

4091
02:40:05,540 --> 02:40:07,000
Listen to the coffee, do you hear the music?

4092
02:40:11,380 --> 02:40:11,780
Alright.

4093
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:12,920
Nothing here yet.

4094
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:14,740
I can't wait to get you fucking nothing though.

4095
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:17,360
Oh, there's a beholder in that room.

4096
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:18,540
Do not let him get close.

4097
02:40:18,660 --> 02:40:19,240
That guy's a dick.

4098
02:40:20,580 --> 02:40:21,380
Go away.

4099
02:40:22,400 --> 02:40:24,300
He might start chasing after us though.

4100
02:40:25,160 --> 02:40:26,460
Wait, is that what he does?

4101
02:40:26,580 --> 02:40:26,920
He chases?

4102
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:28,400
Yeah, he does come after you.

4103
02:40:29,060 --> 02:40:31,380
Oh god, I'm starting to go a little bit cuckoo.

4104
02:40:31,380 --> 02:40:32,060
Okay.

4105
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:34,120
I think you can't stare at him.

4106
02:40:34,220 --> 02:40:35,040
I think that's actually it.

4107
02:40:37,780 --> 02:40:39,400
Oh, it's a CCTV room.

4108
02:40:39,940 --> 02:40:40,700
Nothing in here.

4109
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:41,380
Nothing happens.

4110
02:40:41,760 --> 02:40:42,220
There's nothing.

4111
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:43,720
There's no exit here.

4112
02:40:43,900 --> 02:40:47,380
I keep feeling like you can find loot in these places, but...

4113
02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:50,680
Oh, dead end.

4114
02:40:51,080 --> 02:40:52,280
Oh, we have to go out soon.

4115
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:53,460
It's almost five minutes.

4116
02:40:54,420 --> 02:40:54,640
Oh.

4117
02:40:55,460 --> 02:40:56,160
What was that?

4118
02:40:57,680 --> 02:40:58,300
That's a mine.

4119
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:01,300
Oh, I want to take a picture of the mine.

4120
02:41:01,860 --> 02:41:03,320
Yeah, you can take a picture of it.

4121
02:41:03,800 --> 02:41:05,200
But it's not a lot of points.

4122
02:41:06,800 --> 02:41:07,940
Oh, it's just 29.

4123
02:41:08,760 --> 02:41:09,040
Oh.

4124
02:41:09,400 --> 02:41:10,560
Okay, we should go now.

4125
02:41:11,080 --> 02:41:12,620
Yeah, let's go get the big guy.

4126
02:41:12,740 --> 02:41:13,500
The big guy shows up here.

4127
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:18,140
Wait, how do we go back?

4128
02:41:18,160 --> 02:41:19,640
Is there really a point of going inside?

4129
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:20,220
I wonder.

4130
02:41:21,540 --> 02:41:25,400
This area was very tame for a three-star.

4131
02:41:25,640 --> 02:41:26,000
Yeah.

4132
02:41:27,480 --> 02:41:28,980
Maybe everything is upstairs.

4133
02:41:29,760 --> 02:41:30,060
Maybe.

4134
02:41:30,620 --> 02:41:31,620
Oh no, it's a dead end.

4135
02:41:31,860 --> 02:41:32,720
Oh, seriously?

4136
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:36,280
That sounds like something is spawning.

4137
02:41:36,660 --> 02:41:37,980
Oh, you can see explosions!

4138
02:41:38,240 --> 02:41:38,900
Oh no, you can't.

4139
02:41:40,580 --> 02:41:41,220
Let's go!

4140
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:42,980
Let's get the big stuff!

4141
02:41:43,100 --> 02:41:44,360
Don't hear any fucking left.

4142
02:41:44,620 --> 02:41:45,000
I know.

4143
02:41:53,470 --> 02:41:54,090
Where's the spawn?

4144
02:41:54,090 --> 02:41:55,430
We should spawn up soon, right?

4145
02:41:55,670 --> 02:41:55,990
Yeah.

4146
02:41:56,170 --> 02:41:58,530
There's a big guy over here if you want a picture in the meantime.

4147
02:41:59,430 --> 02:42:00,370
Oh, there is.

4148
02:42:02,430 --> 02:42:04,150
He's prowling around the cars.

4149
02:42:04,950 --> 02:42:05,790
Where is he?

4150
02:42:05,830 --> 02:42:07,190
There's some dogs too, actually.

4151
02:42:09,130 --> 02:42:10,090
Oh, I can't get up there.

4152
02:42:11,090 --> 02:42:12,790
Oh, they're savaging some dudes.

4153
02:42:13,350 --> 02:42:14,290
Rest in peace.

4154
02:42:15,110 --> 02:42:16,470
Oh yeah, there's a big guy over there.

4155
02:42:18,110 --> 02:42:18,730
Where's the door?

4156
02:42:21,350 --> 02:42:22,230
Oh no.

4157
02:42:22,710 --> 02:42:23,550
Oh hey, you're alive.

4158
02:42:23,610 --> 02:42:24,110
What's up?

4159
02:42:24,410 --> 02:42:25,210
What happened?

4160
02:42:25,290 --> 02:42:25,770
What killed you?

4161
02:42:25,790 --> 02:42:27,170
It was the manhole thing.

4162
02:42:27,510 --> 02:42:28,590
It was over there.

4163
02:42:28,790 --> 02:42:30,150
Did you get some pictures, man?

4164
02:42:30,150 --> 02:42:30,810
No.

4165
02:42:31,110 --> 02:42:32,310
Well, I saw something fly.

4166
02:42:32,430 --> 02:42:33,890
I think I took a picture of something flying.

4167
02:42:34,730 --> 02:42:36,010
Zoki got eaten by a manhole.

4168
02:42:36,310 --> 02:42:37,090
Wait, did she die-die?

4169
02:42:37,750 --> 02:42:38,110
No.

4170
02:42:38,430 --> 02:42:38,830
Oh, ok.

4171
02:42:38,950 --> 02:42:39,210
Almost.

4172
02:42:40,430 --> 02:42:41,570
There's a guy right in front of me.

4173
02:42:41,650 --> 02:42:42,890
Oh, and there's another guy right here.

4174
02:42:42,930 --> 02:42:43,110
Wait!

4175
02:42:43,110 --> 02:42:43,530
We should leave.

4176
02:42:44,450 --> 02:42:49,050
I think it spawned right next to where the helicopter is, no?

4177
02:42:49,190 --> 02:42:50,430
I can run past it.

4178
02:42:51,310 --> 02:42:53,070
Oh, he's right next to the helicopter.

4179
02:42:53,310 --> 02:42:54,290
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

4180
02:42:57,650 --> 02:42:58,010
Um...

4181
02:42:58,010 --> 02:43:02,250
If we go around heavily to the left, I think he can't go that way and he'll go past us.

4182
02:43:02,650 --> 02:43:03,510
I'm gonna go right side.

4183
02:43:03,730 --> 02:43:05,290
Ok, I go right, you go left.

4184
02:43:06,130 --> 02:43:06,830
Ok, Zoki.

4185
02:43:15,610 --> 02:43:16,630
I'm following you.

4186
02:43:19,390 --> 02:43:20,110
I was.

4187
02:43:20,250 --> 02:43:20,810
How the hell?

4188
02:43:21,370 --> 02:43:22,330
Oh, there's an alien dog.

4189
02:43:22,470 --> 02:43:23,770
I can't get up!

4190
02:43:28,260 --> 02:43:30,340
Jump and hit control as you're at the top of your jump.

4191
02:43:30,500 --> 02:43:31,340
I did- Oh, there we go.

4192
02:43:31,340 --> 02:43:31,800
There you go.

4193
02:43:59,160 --> 02:44:01,460
Oh jeez, that almost hit me.

4194
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:04,620
How do I leave?

4195
02:44:05,800 --> 02:44:07,660
Guys, how do I get out of here?

4196
02:44:09,320 --> 02:44:14,180
I'm being spawned- I'm being camp spawned by- Oh, this thing is so close to me.

4197
02:44:17,080 --> 02:44:18,860
Can you kill the dog?

4198
02:44:19,700 --> 02:44:21,140
Can you kill the dog?

4199
02:44:22,120 --> 02:44:22,640
Please?

4200
02:44:23,020 --> 02:44:23,600
Oh my god.

4201
02:44:54,520 --> 02:44:55,480
I lived!

4202
02:44:56,940 --> 02:44:57,960
I lived!

4203
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:00,480
Yeah, I got her camera.

4204
02:45:01,080 --> 02:45:01,900
Oh shoot!

4205
02:45:01,980 --> 02:45:03,220
She had more photos!

4206
02:45:03,340 --> 02:45:03,560
No!

4207
02:45:05,140 --> 02:45:07,260
I didn't realize she had a good one.

4208
02:45:08,060 --> 02:45:08,740
I lived!

4209
02:45:13,060 --> 02:45:14,360
I got some good photos.

4210
02:45:20,860 --> 02:45:24,080
You did not believe in the power of the right side.

4211
02:45:24,320 --> 02:45:26,260
That was scary.

4212
02:45:27,660 --> 02:45:30,200
You guys didn't believe in my right side.

4213
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:31,320
That was scary.

4214
02:45:32,200 --> 02:45:33,020
Oh, look at me!

4215
02:45:33,420 --> 02:45:35,820
The guy fucking sniped me with a car.

4216
02:45:36,200 --> 02:45:37,180
Oh, look at my guy!

4217
02:45:37,500 --> 02:45:38,480
Oh, that's your guy.

4218
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:39,960
I got hit by a car.

4219
02:45:40,100 --> 02:45:40,660
Yeah, you did.

4220
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:41,840
I saw it happen.

4221
02:45:46,440 --> 02:45:48,340
What is that photo even?

4222
02:45:48,920 --> 02:45:50,820
What's even going on in this photo?

4223
02:45:52,140 --> 02:45:53,740
Oh my god.

4224
02:45:53,800 --> 02:45:54,980
I hate this game.

4225
02:45:55,180 --> 02:45:57,580
I don't want to play this game with you anymore!

4226
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,300
I hate this fucking game!

4227
02:46:03,260 --> 02:46:07,240
Yeah, and everyone gets to see your fucking helmet that you have to wear.

4228
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:12,360
Everybody gets to see Doki Bird with her stupid helmet.

4229
02:46:19,320 --> 02:46:21,460
I'm just really good at the news.

4230
02:46:21,560 --> 02:46:22,420
What can I say?

4231
02:46:23,960 --> 02:46:24,680
There you go.

4232
02:46:24,780 --> 02:46:26,320
Now we can all have helmets.

4233
02:46:34,320 --> 02:46:36,140
Blue camera is for everybody too.

4234
02:46:36,360 --> 02:46:37,800
Oh wow, I have one too.

4235
02:46:43,640 --> 02:46:44,600
Repeated photo.

4236
02:46:53,660 --> 02:46:57,380
Did you see they gave us something cool and new on the next difficulty level?

4237
02:46:57,520 --> 02:46:58,840
That's because... yeah, I see.

4238
02:47:00,060 --> 02:47:03,600
I think like every time we beat a level, we get to see a new monster.

4239
02:47:04,120 --> 02:47:05,460
Yeah, it seems to be the case.

4240
02:47:07,800 --> 02:47:11,360
Oh yeah, we are all special now.

4241
02:47:11,500 --> 02:47:12,820
We all have the special helmet.

4242
02:47:12,920 --> 02:47:14,160
Lime, you lost your hair.

4243
02:47:14,950 --> 02:47:19,180
Oh wait, we'll never get to see that funny photo of Lime.

4244
02:47:19,980 --> 02:47:23,180
Because Doki didn't get the camera because she's a coward, stupid baby.

4245
02:47:26,540 --> 02:47:29,100
The photo of you dancing in front of the thing.

4246
02:47:34,040 --> 02:47:34,580
Yeah!

4247
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:38,100
Oh nice.

4248
02:47:38,100 --> 02:47:39,620
I'm scared of going near cars now.

4249
02:47:40,060 --> 02:47:41,960
The PTSD.

4250
02:47:42,800 --> 02:47:43,500
I hear music.

4251
02:47:43,880 --> 02:47:44,800
Cars and ladders.

4252
02:47:46,880 --> 02:47:48,420
Yeah, pretty much everything.

4253
02:47:49,400 --> 02:47:50,660
I mean, there's nothing in front of us.

4254
02:47:50,660 --> 02:47:51,880
This is a horrible map.

4255
02:47:51,980 --> 02:47:54,560
This is like a really difficult map to start people on.

4256
02:47:55,400 --> 02:47:57,440
Because like it's so far away.

4257
02:47:58,100 --> 02:48:00,200
There's a building actually right across here.

4258
02:48:00,800 --> 02:48:01,260
Oh yeah.

4259
02:48:02,360 --> 02:48:03,760
It's cool to go to that building.

4260
02:48:04,240 --> 02:48:06,320
I wanna go to Sarota Bank.

4261
02:48:06,320 --> 02:48:12,160
I feel like we should all stay outside and like camp somewhere and then get the big monster when he comes.

4262
02:48:12,420 --> 02:48:12,860
Cowards.

4263
02:48:14,060 --> 02:48:14,360
What?

4264
02:48:14,600 --> 02:48:15,380
It's for the money!

4265
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:17,640
It's for the money!

4266
02:48:20,940 --> 02:48:22,700
Call me in the hotel lobby.

4267
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:24,300
This building looks cool.

4268
02:48:24,580 --> 02:48:26,080
I like it.

4269
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:31,220
You wanna stay outside and not see this amazing place.

4270
02:48:32,520 --> 02:48:34,600
I mean, amazing is subjective.

4271
02:48:34,600 --> 02:48:35,920
Amazingly fucked up hotel.

4272
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:40,180
That means there's vacancy, guys.

4273
02:48:41,800 --> 02:48:43,800
We can get a suite for a discount.

4274
02:48:43,900 --> 02:48:45,660
Oh my god, we can get a suite!

4275
02:48:45,660 --> 02:48:47,260
A suite discount, get it?

4276
02:48:49,940 --> 02:48:54,100
Okay, this just looks like an office now.

4277
02:48:54,460 --> 02:48:54,560
Oh yeah.

4278
02:48:55,240 --> 02:48:56,480
Now we're back in the studio.

4279
02:48:58,520 --> 02:48:59,700
How do you feel about that?

4280
02:48:59,860 --> 02:49:00,580
Oh, it's the pupil.

4281
02:49:00,580 --> 02:49:00,700
Pupil.

4282
02:49:02,420 --> 02:49:02,980
Pupil.

4283
02:49:03,720 --> 02:49:04,020
Pupil.

4284
02:49:06,500 --> 02:49:06,900
Where?

4285
02:49:11,020 --> 02:49:12,080
He's right there.

4286
02:49:13,220 --> 02:49:14,260
Oh yeah, I see him.

4287
02:49:17,960 --> 02:49:19,020
What is it doing?

4288
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:21,260
I wish it's closer.

4289
02:49:21,780 --> 02:49:22,800
So I can get a better photo.

4290
02:49:23,740 --> 02:49:24,240
Oh.

4291
02:49:29,660 --> 02:49:30,160
Ew.

4292
02:49:32,400 --> 02:49:34,180
He's like a little tarantula.

4293
02:49:34,680 --> 02:49:35,680
I don't even see him.

4294
02:49:36,080 --> 02:49:37,300
He just went out of sight.

4295
02:49:37,880 --> 02:49:39,400
Oh, I see him.

4296
02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:42,960
Oh, he's gross.

4297
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:46,580
He's like a little octopus.

4298
02:49:47,080 --> 02:49:47,900
Yeah, he's kinda cute.

4299
02:49:48,620 --> 02:49:50,060
Uh oh, he's going upstairs now.

4300
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:52,020
Yeah, but he can't do anything.

4301
02:49:52,220 --> 02:49:53,120
He's just a...

4302
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:53,960
You think that?

4303
02:49:55,520 --> 02:49:56,500
I'm pretty sure.

4304
02:49:56,720 --> 02:49:57,260
Oh, he's leaving.

4305
02:49:59,700 --> 02:50:01,020
Oh, he just walked away.

4306
02:50:01,240 --> 02:50:02,460
See, I told you he wouldn't do anything.

4307
02:50:03,140 --> 02:50:04,300
Going through our exit.

4308
02:50:04,820 --> 02:50:06,040
The way we needed to go.

4309
02:50:07,220 --> 02:50:09,320
I'm sure we won't have a problem when we need to leave.

4310
02:50:12,020 --> 02:50:16,000
Oh, there's like the skin masks here.

4311
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:16,840
The stalagmites.

4312
02:50:16,840 --> 02:50:21,200
I feel like the building layouts in this game are a little bit better than Lethal Company.

4313
02:50:21,460 --> 02:50:27,500
And that if you go like more than 10 feet from the entrance, you don't get endlessly lost inside an infinite labyrinth and never get out again.

4314
02:50:27,520 --> 02:50:27,920
Oh yeah, yeah.

4315
02:50:28,240 --> 02:50:30,460
I think this leads back to the opening room.

4316
02:50:31,740 --> 02:50:32,760
Yeah, we just...

4317
02:50:32,760 --> 02:50:33,280
What?

4318
02:50:38,400 --> 02:50:39,880
I got a cool photo though.

4319
02:50:39,940 --> 02:50:40,320
Me too.

4320
02:50:40,600 --> 02:50:43,720
I got a 700 score photo because he was flying at my face.

4321
02:50:44,620 --> 02:50:45,020
Nice.

4322
02:50:50,380 --> 02:50:52,940
I got a 900 photo.

4323
02:50:53,180 --> 02:50:53,620
Nice.

4324
02:50:54,060 --> 02:50:55,520
Me too, I got one too.

4325
02:50:57,180 --> 02:50:58,020
Let's go.

4326
02:50:58,760 --> 02:50:58,900
Oh.

4327
02:51:00,680 --> 02:51:02,800
That is a modified dog.

4328
02:51:06,410 --> 02:51:07,730
Can you pose for me?

4329
02:51:11,750 --> 02:51:12,630
Thank you.

4330
02:51:12,790 --> 02:51:13,110
You're welcome.

4331
02:51:15,530 --> 02:51:18,870
I like how the immediate pose is just like the fucking hands in the air.

4332
02:51:18,870 --> 02:51:20,090
Pose number 8, baby!

4333
02:51:20,430 --> 02:51:21,210
Never fail!

4334
02:51:22,070 --> 02:51:25,210
Oh, hello.

4335
02:51:25,970 --> 02:51:26,770
Can you pose for me?

4336
02:51:30,010 --> 02:51:30,470
Nice.

4337
02:51:31,170 --> 02:51:32,150
Oh, nice, nice.

4338
02:51:35,550 --> 02:51:36,490
Beautiful, beautiful.

4339
02:51:39,150 --> 02:51:40,150
Work it, baby, work it.

4340
02:51:40,170 --> 02:51:42,290
This was the way to do the shortcut, right?

4341
02:51:44,070 --> 02:51:45,250
It's not there anymore.

4342
02:51:45,250 --> 02:51:45,410
It's not there anymore.

4343
02:51:47,890 --> 02:51:48,410
Wait.

4344
02:51:48,650 --> 02:51:50,570
There used to be a box there, I think.

4345
02:51:51,090 --> 02:51:51,470
Nope.

4346
02:51:51,770 --> 02:51:52,330
Still works.

4347
02:51:52,690 --> 02:51:54,370
Still works.

4348
02:51:54,630 --> 02:51:57,430
Oh, he's here.

4349
02:52:08,130 --> 02:52:09,610
Oh, it's the military men.

4350
02:52:12,890 --> 02:52:14,090
I don't know.

4351
02:52:14,910 --> 02:52:15,910
Are they going to kill him?

4352
02:52:17,150 --> 02:52:18,850
I don't know if they actually can.

4353
02:52:23,390 --> 02:52:24,690
I don't think so.

4354
02:52:24,690 --> 02:52:25,030
I don't think they can.

4355
02:52:25,310 --> 02:52:26,090
I don't think so either.

4356
02:52:27,190 --> 02:52:28,230
Where are they?

4357
02:52:28,370 --> 02:52:29,050
I don't even see them.

4358
02:52:29,770 --> 02:52:30,790
They're in the bushes.

4359
02:52:31,530 --> 02:52:32,830
Oh, I see them.

4360
02:52:33,550 --> 02:52:36,030
Oh, damn, I missed it.

4361
02:52:36,610 --> 02:52:37,190
I got it.

4362
02:52:37,550 --> 02:52:39,670
There's a...

4363
02:52:41,330 --> 02:52:43,610
Big dude with a fist behind his...

4364
02:52:43,610 --> 02:52:44,210
Oh, shit!

4365
02:52:44,690 --> 02:52:46,030
It's the big man again.

4366
02:52:47,270 --> 02:52:47,670
Oh!

4367
02:52:54,430 --> 02:52:55,710
Is he going to slap me?

4368
02:52:57,890 --> 02:52:58,530
He's going to slap!

4369
02:52:58,670 --> 02:52:59,170
He's going to slap!

4370
02:53:00,010 --> 02:53:01,270
How can he slap?

4371
02:53:05,270 --> 02:53:06,090
Is he slapping?

4372
02:53:09,870 --> 02:53:12,290
Oh my god, what are you doing right now?

4373
02:53:12,710 --> 02:53:13,630
What are you doing?

4374
02:53:14,050 --> 02:53:15,130
You're the one on the screen.

4375
02:53:17,410 --> 02:53:19,110
Ok, I think we got the photos, right?

4376
02:53:19,110 --> 02:53:20,410
I still have seven.

4377
02:53:21,130 --> 02:53:22,950
I still have six left, yeah.

4378
02:53:24,350 --> 02:53:26,350
Oh, shit.

4379
02:53:43,780 --> 02:53:44,340
No!

4380
02:53:45,260 --> 02:53:45,840
We're good.

4381
02:53:45,980 --> 02:53:46,380
We're good.

4382
02:53:50,760 --> 02:53:51,780
That's what I'm saying.

4383
02:53:54,200 --> 02:53:55,200
Oh, dang it.

4384
02:53:55,280 --> 02:53:56,200
I got it's ass though.

4385
02:53:56,600 --> 02:53:57,620
I have one more.

4386
02:53:57,960 --> 02:53:58,900
Ok, do something cool.

4387
02:54:00,080 --> 02:54:00,280
Oh!

4388
02:54:01,280 --> 02:54:03,800
Oh, wait, did she die?

4389
02:54:03,940 --> 02:54:04,260
Yes.

4390
02:54:05,540 --> 02:54:07,500
I don't know what...

4391
02:54:07,500 --> 02:54:08,520
Her helmet though!

4392
02:54:11,300 --> 02:54:12,460
She's got three photos.

4393
02:54:16,280 --> 02:54:16,760
Alright.

4394
02:54:44,490 --> 02:54:45,690
We made it.

4395
02:54:45,770 --> 02:54:46,170
It's fine.

4396
02:54:46,570 --> 02:54:49,310
A car flew over your head.

4397
02:54:49,370 --> 02:54:49,810
I know.

4398
02:54:52,230 --> 02:54:56,210
I got killed because I decided to take a selfie as a bus flew at me.

4399
02:54:56,210 --> 02:54:56,430
No!

4400
02:54:57,930 --> 02:54:59,150
Wait, did it show up?

4401
02:54:59,210 --> 02:55:00,270
Did that photo show up?

4402
02:55:00,290 --> 02:55:00,950
I hope so.

4403
02:55:02,010 --> 02:55:02,950
I wanna see.

4404
02:55:03,050 --> 02:55:06,150
I hope we get that photo of the bus.

4405
02:55:07,650 --> 02:55:08,490
Very nice.

4406
02:55:12,270 --> 02:55:14,950
I think that was the bus that flew at me.

4407
02:55:18,990 --> 02:55:19,910
Oh, yeah!

4408
02:55:19,910 --> 02:55:20,950
Very nice.

4409
02:55:27,660 --> 02:55:29,900
Damn, we almost got it in one.

4410
02:55:29,920 --> 02:55:30,620
Oh my god!

4411
02:55:31,320 --> 02:55:32,520
Yeah, we just need one more.

4412
02:55:33,260 --> 02:55:35,040
Wait, how many points do we need?

4413
02:55:36,060 --> 02:55:36,540
600.

4414
02:55:37,560 --> 02:55:38,800
600 points, yeah.

4415
02:55:39,020 --> 02:55:39,340
That's good.

4416
02:55:41,920 --> 02:55:44,080
I'm gonna download that.

4417
02:55:44,400 --> 02:55:45,820
And save to my desktop.

4418
02:55:46,280 --> 02:55:48,420
I like how we have two POV of this.

4419
02:55:48,620 --> 02:55:49,860
And we can watch everything.

4420
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:55,240
Mine only counted more because you were in the picture too, I think.

4421
02:55:55,300 --> 02:55:57,180
Yeah, I was also in the photo.

4422
02:56:01,620 --> 02:56:02,140
Yeah.

4423
02:56:02,660 --> 02:56:03,640
Oh my god!

4424
02:56:04,480 --> 02:56:05,740
It's so cursed!

4425
02:56:06,600 --> 02:56:07,580
It looks like a...

4426
02:56:07,580 --> 02:56:08,360
Which one of us got hit?

4427
02:56:08,780 --> 02:56:10,040
I don't know.

4428
02:56:10,220 --> 02:56:12,320
Maybe it didn't go up before I fucking ate shit.

4429
02:56:13,440 --> 02:56:15,240
This one is so stupid.

4430
02:56:15,820 --> 02:56:17,220
Yeah, I like this one.

4431
02:56:19,860 --> 02:56:21,080
This one got the most points though.

4432
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:26,640
Because it was a repeated photo.

4433
02:56:26,740 --> 02:56:27,960
This was the second photo you took.

4434
02:56:28,120 --> 02:56:31,260
If this was your first photo, you would have got more.

4435
02:56:31,420 --> 02:56:32,200
Yeah, I think so.

4436
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:33,760
Dang.

4437
02:56:34,900 --> 02:56:37,080
I mean, that photo alone got you a thousand.

4438
02:56:38,220 --> 02:56:39,000
Hell yeah.

4439
02:56:39,420 --> 02:56:40,240
Hell yeah.

4440
02:56:40,480 --> 02:56:43,600
This game is easier, I think, than Lethal Company.

4441
02:56:43,940 --> 02:56:44,620
I feel like.

4442
02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:45,240
Much easier.

4443
02:56:45,240 --> 02:56:46,980
I mean, because we decide when to go.

4444
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:48,220
We know when to go.

4445
02:56:48,780 --> 02:56:50,500
Oh, okay.

4446
02:56:51,180 --> 02:56:51,580
Apocalyptic.

4447
02:56:52,220 --> 02:56:54,640
That is so like...

4448
02:56:54,640 --> 02:56:55,600
What does that mean?

4449
02:56:57,360 --> 02:56:59,380
Explosions and monsters and corpses.

4450
02:57:00,700 --> 02:57:03,220
Yeah, but how is that worse than Darwin Awards?

4451
02:57:04,260 --> 02:57:06,840
Because you have to put yourself in danger for Darwin Awards.

4452
02:57:07,360 --> 02:57:08,460
Oh, do you want that flashlight?

4453
02:57:08,600 --> 02:57:08,880
Here you go.

4454
02:57:09,400 --> 02:57:10,040
I grabbed it for you.

4455
02:57:10,140 --> 02:57:12,920
Sorry, I couldn't get your helmet because I had...

4456
02:57:12,920 --> 02:57:14,260
Yeah, no, no, you're good.

4457
02:57:14,360 --> 02:57:16,780
I can probably do like one more.

4458
02:57:18,580 --> 02:57:20,340
Let's finish this, guys.

4459
02:57:21,360 --> 02:57:24,200
As long as someone gets out with like two photos, we win.

4460
02:57:24,340 --> 02:57:26,620
Yeah, we don't have to be super risky here.

4461
02:57:27,480 --> 02:57:28,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4462
02:57:28,420 --> 02:57:30,820
I mean, we can find the...

4463
02:57:30,820 --> 02:57:32,160
Or risk it all.

4464
02:57:34,140 --> 02:57:35,900
Or risk it all.

4465
02:57:36,840 --> 02:57:37,840
Risk everything.

4466
02:57:38,680 --> 02:57:41,280
We're one day off of retirement, guys.

4467
02:57:41,280 --> 02:57:42,800
Oh, yeah, we're one day off of retirement.

4468
02:57:43,860 --> 02:57:45,080
Oh, and then we can like do...

4469
02:57:45,080 --> 02:57:47,480
If we pass this, we can do the later levels with Snuffy.

4470
02:57:48,080 --> 02:57:48,740
The final level.

4471
02:57:49,860 --> 02:57:51,220
Yeah, let's save progress, I think.

4472
02:57:51,800 --> 02:57:52,360
Oh, true, true.

4473
02:57:52,400 --> 02:57:57,460
Man, I sure can't wait to finish my job as a journalist and go spend the rest of my days with my family.

4474
02:57:58,100 --> 02:57:59,360
In and out, super safe.

4475
02:57:59,420 --> 02:58:00,160
There'll be no problems.

4476
02:58:00,320 --> 02:58:03,500
There'll never be a better thing than to go...

4477
02:58:04,760 --> 02:58:06,520
...retire in the Bahamas.

4478
02:58:08,540 --> 02:58:09,500
The Bahamas.

4479
02:58:09,800 --> 02:58:10,600
The Bahamas.

4480
02:58:11,880 --> 02:58:12,360
The Bahamas.

4481
02:58:12,360 --> 02:58:14,020
Do you want to go to this building over here this time?

4482
02:58:14,200 --> 02:58:15,120
Yeah, let's go to that building.

4483
02:58:15,920 --> 02:58:18,560
It's closer to the jump skip, too.

4484
02:58:18,680 --> 02:58:19,020
True.

4485
02:58:20,200 --> 02:58:22,600
Those growls are always...

4486
02:58:22,600 --> 02:58:25,300
They're always really close, but I don't think they're actually anywhere.

4487
02:58:25,960 --> 02:58:26,160
I call this the doki skip.

4488
02:58:26,160 --> 02:58:27,480
The doki skip.

4489
02:58:28,200 --> 02:58:29,780
Shortcut, I call it the doki skip.

4490
02:58:31,700 --> 02:58:34,340
The basic fucking crouch jump, Ari.

4491
02:58:34,340 --> 02:58:36,460
Aw man, we're in this building again.

4492
02:58:37,240 --> 02:58:38,300
Oh, there's a trap here?

4493
02:58:38,660 --> 02:58:40,520
Oh, and a stalker.

4494
02:58:40,600 --> 02:58:42,340
I invented it, though.

4495
02:58:42,500 --> 02:58:43,860
You invented crouch jumping?

4496
02:58:43,960 --> 02:58:44,420
That's crazy.

4497
02:58:44,440 --> 02:58:45,560
Alright, I'm gonna do the...

4498
02:58:45,560 --> 02:58:47,740
I'm gonna do the trap if anyone wants to...

4499
02:58:48,180 --> 02:58:48,840
...let me go.

4500
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:51,020
Before you do...

4501
02:58:52,440 --> 02:58:53,860
Doki, take a pose in front.

4502
02:58:54,780 --> 02:58:55,720
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

4503
02:58:57,120 --> 02:58:58,500
I'm dying, I'm dying.

4504
02:58:58,600 --> 02:58:58,960
Oh, thank you.

4505
02:59:00,400 --> 02:59:01,140
Oh, shoot.

4506
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:13,480
I am.

4507
02:59:14,340 --> 02:59:15,700
And there's something coming after me!

4508
02:59:23,380 --> 02:59:24,800
I gamed, I gamed.

4509
02:59:27,020 --> 02:59:27,900
Holy shit!

4510
02:59:28,600 --> 02:59:30,600
Yeah, we did it, we did it, we did it.

4511
02:59:31,580 --> 02:59:33,380
I gamed, I gamed.

4512
02:59:35,100 --> 02:59:37,040
My favorite of the year right there.

4513
02:59:37,080 --> 02:59:37,920
Holy shit.

4514
02:59:39,560 --> 02:59:40,620
Watch out, watch out!

4515
02:59:40,880 --> 02:59:42,120
There's a guy right next to the shortcut.

4516
02:59:42,820 --> 02:59:44,240
Tiny man, tiny man.

4517
02:59:45,480 --> 02:59:46,360
What do we do?

4518
02:59:46,460 --> 02:59:47,780
Oh no, not the Doki skip.

4519
02:59:48,660 --> 02:59:50,800
He's guarding the Doki skip, what a dick.

4520
02:59:53,900 --> 02:59:56,000
If I die, you have to get my camera.

4521
02:59:56,180 --> 02:59:57,960
This is a very, very...

4522
02:59:57,960 --> 03:00:00,120
I got the apocalypse scenario in it.

4523
03:00:01,700 --> 03:00:03,300
I got apocalypse, yeah.

4524
03:00:05,500 --> 03:00:06,980
Okay, see if I can make this.

4525
03:00:07,060 --> 03:00:08,420
I did it last time, first try.

4526
03:00:09,300 --> 03:00:10,560
First try, I did it.

4527
03:00:11,220 --> 03:00:11,600
Alright,

4528
03:00:16,630 --> 03:00:17,430
it's time to go.

4529
03:00:18,770 --> 03:00:21,130
But what if we waited for the giant monster?

4530
03:00:22,050 --> 03:00:24,110
We could just wait up here, nothing gets us here.

4531
03:00:25,610 --> 03:00:26,370
I guess.

4532
03:00:26,930 --> 03:00:28,470
Or we just wait by the helicopter.

4533
03:00:29,670 --> 03:00:32,270
Yeah, that's true, we can wait by it and exit it when he shows up.

4534
03:00:32,830 --> 03:00:34,430
But one of us has to stay outside.

4535
03:00:35,890 --> 03:00:37,590
Not you, apparently.

4536
03:00:37,990 --> 03:00:38,430
Not me.

4537
03:00:40,790 --> 03:00:43,090
Okay, but if I die, get my camera.

4538
03:00:44,710 --> 03:00:46,450
Oh, there's a guy over there.

4539
03:00:52,170 --> 03:00:55,590
There he is, there's a little guy over there.

4540
03:00:56,690 --> 03:00:58,030
You heard that too, right?

4541
03:00:58,770 --> 03:01:00,430
He's coming over.

4542
03:01:00,950 --> 03:01:01,950
He won't get us.

4543
03:01:02,630 --> 03:01:05,730
We might have to leave if he doesn't stop walking towards us.

4544
03:01:05,730 --> 03:01:07,450
He's like hobbling over towards us.

4545
03:01:07,810 --> 03:01:09,570
Oh, he doesn't see you, he's blind.

4546
03:01:09,930 --> 03:01:10,490
He's nearsighted.

4547
03:01:10,490 --> 03:01:13,150
I know, stuff to our right, right?

4548
03:01:13,210 --> 03:01:15,350
I'm being Jurassic Park noises.

4549
03:01:16,270 --> 03:01:18,170
Oh, you're right, I hear that too.

4550
03:01:18,870 --> 03:01:19,910
That's spooky.

4551
03:01:21,670 --> 03:01:23,950
It's cause they're all around us, we're just...

4552
03:01:25,770 --> 03:01:26,690
Come on.

4553
03:01:27,370 --> 03:01:29,670
Hey, big guy.

4554
03:01:29,670 --> 03:01:31,870
There's no one behind us.

4555
03:01:32,550 --> 03:01:33,930
Oh my god.

4556
03:01:34,150 --> 03:01:36,290
It really is super Jurassic Park.

4557
03:01:40,710 --> 03:01:44,170
Oh, here it comes.

4558
03:01:44,830 --> 03:01:45,670
Camera's ready.

4559
03:01:59,670 --> 03:02:01,670
What the hell?

4560
03:02:06,570 --> 03:02:08,490
Oh, you're welcome.

4561
03:02:08,930 --> 03:02:09,630
I'll emote.

4562
03:02:11,190 --> 03:02:14,150
Once the guy comes in, you can use me.

4563
03:02:17,570 --> 03:02:18,390
You're welcome.

4564
03:02:19,030 --> 03:02:21,670
It's my pleasure to be your...

4565
03:02:26,130 --> 03:02:28,110
I'm ready for Slenderman.

4566
03:02:34,590 --> 03:02:36,810
I'm trying to find the best one that I can do.

4567
03:02:38,970 --> 03:02:42,550
Okay, I'll wave.

4568
03:02:43,710 --> 03:02:44,330
Number three.

4569
03:02:45,250 --> 03:02:45,490
Hello!

4570
03:02:49,370 --> 03:02:54,150
Oh, there he is!

4571
03:02:58,570 --> 03:03:01,650
It's the...

4572
03:03:02,250 --> 03:03:03,130
How lame.

4573
03:03:03,410 --> 03:03:04,590
Can you strike a pose for me?

4574
03:03:05,270 --> 03:03:06,030
Thank you.

4575
03:03:06,950 --> 03:03:07,390
Okay.

4576
03:03:08,990 --> 03:03:11,730
Oh wow, you're trying to maximize your min-maxing.

4577
03:03:16,210 --> 03:03:17,850
We already got it.

4578
03:03:20,290 --> 03:03:21,030
There we go.

4579
03:03:21,410 --> 03:03:24,630
I'm hoping that he explodes something, cause it'll probably give us extra points.

4580
03:03:24,850 --> 03:03:26,250
It is kind of right now.

4581
03:03:27,770 --> 03:03:29,730
Oh, there's a club there too.

4582
03:03:30,310 --> 03:03:31,070
He's coming.

4583
03:03:31,470 --> 03:03:32,290
The club.

4584
03:03:34,850 --> 03:03:38,510
I turned around.

4585
03:03:44,650 --> 03:03:48,430
I kind of want to see what happens if he gets sucked into the tornado.

4586
03:03:49,890 --> 03:03:51,610
Give this journalist a medal of bravery.

4587
03:03:51,930 --> 03:03:52,430
I know.

4588
03:03:56,350 --> 03:03:57,930
That's why I'm the only survivor.

4589
03:03:57,930 --> 03:03:59,430
We all survived.

4590
03:03:59,490 --> 03:04:00,110
What are you talking about?

4591
03:04:02,590 --> 03:04:03,550
Alright, let's see.

4592
03:04:03,550 --> 03:04:05,030
I'm pretty sure Lime got the best photo.

4593
03:04:05,450 --> 03:04:07,210
Yeah, Lime's award winning photo.

4594
03:04:07,790 --> 03:04:10,370
Yeah, the award winning photo right there.

4595
03:04:10,790 --> 03:04:14,050
Oh yeah, that one.

4596
03:04:16,510 --> 03:04:18,570
Mine was apparently just that much cooler.

4597
03:04:18,950 --> 03:04:20,370
I can't believe I...

4598
03:04:20,370 --> 03:04:21,430
Oh wow, I look awesome.

4599
03:04:21,830 --> 03:04:22,710
That was cool.

4600
03:04:22,810 --> 03:04:23,910
That one was cool.

4601
03:04:24,210 --> 03:04:25,970
Oh, I look awesome!

4602
03:04:25,970 --> 03:04:29,730
Lime's gonna be firing it though, so...

4603
03:04:29,730 --> 03:04:30,730
Better photo.

4604
03:04:31,770 --> 03:04:31,990
Yay!

4605
03:04:32,710 --> 03:04:34,210
We did it!

4606
03:04:35,510 --> 03:04:36,970
Alright, guys.

4607
03:04:37,210 --> 03:04:38,610
Look at my headliner here.

4608
03:04:38,930 --> 03:04:40,970
That is actually a really cool photo.

4609
03:04:41,370 --> 03:04:42,850
That is a really cool photo.

4610
03:04:43,610 --> 03:04:46,260
It's not a fucking cell that we burned once.

4611
03:04:46,830 --> 03:04:47,010
I know.

4612
03:04:48,890 --> 03:04:51,970
So our photos went...

4613
03:04:51,970 --> 03:04:54,290
Mid doing something real sus with a monster.

4614
03:04:54,290 --> 03:04:55,890
Actually cool photo.

4615
03:04:56,130 --> 03:04:57,190
Actually cool photo.

4616
03:05:00,430 --> 03:05:02,250
Hey, and I'm in two of them, baby.

4617
03:05:03,990 --> 03:05:06,690
That actually looks like something I can see in a newspaper.

4618
03:05:07,590 --> 03:05:10,390
It actually has some form of composition going on.

4619
03:05:10,410 --> 03:05:11,590
Yeah, save it, save it.

4620
03:05:13,810 --> 03:05:15,350
Oh yeah, how do I save this shit?

4621
03:05:15,670 --> 03:05:18,130
I can submit this at the start of my journalism career.

4622
03:05:18,510 --> 03:05:18,850
Oh, here we go.

4623
03:05:19,510 --> 03:05:20,590
Rule of thirds, baby!

4624
03:05:21,890 --> 03:05:22,910
Oh my god.

4625
03:05:23,210 --> 03:05:24,270
I can't believe it.

4626
03:05:24,370 --> 03:05:25,030
We did it.

4627
03:05:25,110 --> 03:05:26,590
We learned how to be real journalists.

4628
03:05:27,930 --> 03:05:28,330
Yeah!

4629
03:05:29,670 --> 03:05:32,130
I can't wait to show Snuffy when she gets a new CPU.

4630
03:05:32,530 --> 03:05:32,830
I know.

4631
03:05:34,230 --> 03:05:37,070
We'll continue our run and get to level 5 with Snuffy.

4632
03:05:37,510 --> 03:05:37,990
Oh my god.

4633
03:05:38,890 --> 03:05:40,770
God, that's a trial by fucking fire.

4634
03:05:40,890 --> 03:05:44,890
It's like, hey Snuffy, go into this building and she just instantly gets monged by a headcrab or something.

4635
03:05:45,550 --> 03:05:47,130
You mean this isn't the best photo?

4636
03:05:47,230 --> 03:05:49,030
We all come back for one last time.

4637
03:05:49,030 --> 03:05:50,570
This isn't the best one.

4638
03:05:51,490 --> 03:05:53,130
Nobody likes this one.

4639
03:05:58,110 --> 03:05:58,710
Nice.

4640
03:06:00,250 --> 03:06:01,790
Oh yeah, there's you hanging.

4641
03:06:02,070 --> 03:06:02,530
Oh yeah.

4642
03:06:02,970 --> 03:06:03,610
Oh wow.

4643
03:06:04,230 --> 03:06:05,090
God damn.

4644
03:06:05,850 --> 03:06:06,810
YouTube don't look...

4645
03:06:07,710 --> 03:06:09,410
It does look pretty dark.

4646
03:06:10,010 --> 03:06:12,310
What is this photo?

4647
03:06:12,450 --> 03:06:13,510
This is such ass.

4648
03:06:14,190 --> 03:06:15,970
I'm not even in it.

4649
03:06:15,970 --> 03:06:17,490
You're like, hey, whoa, whoa.

4650
03:06:17,590 --> 03:06:19,270
You look like you're not a journalist.

4651
03:06:19,450 --> 03:06:22,470
You're actually going at the paparazzi after they found my...

4652
03:06:23,490 --> 03:06:25,750
They found my dangling body.

4653
03:06:29,970 --> 03:06:30,410
Oh,

4654
03:06:38,650 --> 03:06:40,010
this is where we did the explosions.

4655
03:06:40,950 --> 03:06:41,770
The fuck is that?

4656
03:06:42,110 --> 03:06:44,030
Oh, it's the guy that comes out.

4657
03:06:44,030 --> 03:06:44,450
It's the guy.

4658
03:06:44,590 --> 03:06:46,050
I saw him in there.

4659
03:06:46,210 --> 03:06:47,090
Me taking a selfie.

4660
03:06:51,630 --> 03:06:52,450
GG's guys.

4661
03:06:52,510 --> 03:06:55,830
It was a great pleasure being a journalist with all of you.

4662
03:06:55,930 --> 03:06:56,690
I think we were pretty good.

4663
03:06:56,830 --> 03:06:57,730
Yeah, I had a great time.

4664
03:06:59,530 --> 03:07:00,810
Look at that shit.

4665
03:07:01,270 --> 03:07:02,290
Let's take a selfie together.

4666
03:07:02,630 --> 03:07:04,050
One last selfie.

4667
03:07:05,390 --> 03:07:07,210
We should all do a selfie together.

4668
03:07:07,210 --> 03:07:07,590
Okay.

4669
03:07:09,410 --> 03:07:10,150
Oh, uh...

4670
03:07:10,150 --> 03:07:12,890
Wait, how does this work?

4671
03:07:13,030 --> 03:07:13,950
How do we get together?

4672
03:07:15,590 --> 03:07:16,170
Oh, there we go.

4673
03:07:16,350 --> 03:07:17,690
Oh my god, wait.

4674
03:07:21,890 --> 03:07:22,590
I'm trying to...

4675
03:07:22,590 --> 03:07:23,410
I'm trying to A.

4676
03:07:23,770 --> 03:07:25,530
Oh, I'm trying to A too.

4677
03:07:34,210 --> 03:07:36,650
One last photo for the ride.

4678
03:07:39,850 --> 03:07:42,430
I love that you guys still have your safety helmets on.

4679
03:07:44,030 --> 03:07:44,890
Yeah, baby.

4680
03:07:46,590 --> 03:07:47,630
Yeah, we're special.

4681
03:07:48,370 --> 03:07:49,050
Oh yeah.

4682
03:07:50,110 --> 03:07:51,070
GG's everyone.

4683
03:07:51,790 --> 03:07:53,810
Thanks for playing Headliners.

4684
03:07:54,010 --> 03:07:54,850
It was fun.

4685
03:07:55,850 --> 03:07:58,130
Let's hope we can get Snuffy in next time.

4686
03:07:58,570 --> 03:07:59,030
Hell yeah.

4687
03:07:59,590 --> 03:08:00,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4688
03:08:00,750 --> 03:08:03,390
Let's hope...

4689
03:08:04,690 --> 03:08:05,370
Snuffy's PC will be okay.

4690
03:08:05,370 --> 03:08:08,330
Yeah, I'm gonna rest my voice right after this.

4691
03:08:08,490 --> 03:08:09,390
But GG's guys.

4692
03:08:10,230 --> 03:08:12,530
Let's hope Snuffy's PC will be okay.

4693
03:08:12,890 --> 03:08:13,070
I know.

4694
03:08:14,130 --> 03:08:15,210
Alright, bye bye.

4695
03:08:16,850 --> 03:08:16,910
Bye bye.

4696
03:08:18,970 --> 03:08:19,650
Bye.

4697
03:08:21,770 --> 03:08:21,790
Bye.

4698
03:08:21,790 --> 03:08:22,170
See ya.

4699
03:08:22,210 --> 03:08:22,530
Bye.

4700
03:08:23,850 --> 03:08:24,290
Bye.

4701
03:08:26,070 --> 03:08:26,750
Yay,

4702
03:08:31,040 --> 03:08:31,960
that was so silly.

4703
03:08:32,820 --> 03:08:33,960
That was so fun.

4704
03:08:33,960 --> 03:08:36,960
I hope you guys enjoyed our silliness.

4705
03:08:37,280 --> 03:08:39,140
Our being silly journalists.

4706
03:08:39,940 --> 03:08:45,560
I feel like the game actually becomes a little bit like a strategy.

4707
03:08:47,840 --> 03:08:51,660
It's like, okay, how can I maximize my...

4708
03:08:51,660 --> 03:08:52,260
Everything.

4709
03:08:54,440 --> 03:08:55,660
Silly and deadly.

4710
03:08:56,220 --> 03:08:59,480
I can't believe Lime and I noclip through the world.

4711
03:09:00,620 --> 03:09:03,940
And then Doki exploded from a parked car.

4712
03:09:04,920 --> 03:09:05,460
Truly, I wonder...

4713
03:09:05,460 --> 03:09:06,020
I don't know.

4714
03:09:06,560 --> 03:09:10,060
Truly, we are the ones to do it.

4715
03:09:14,080 --> 03:09:16,900
Yeah, it was much easier than I Feel Lethal Company.

4716
03:09:17,100 --> 03:09:19,580
Because we were able to get much more.

4717
03:09:19,700 --> 03:09:23,100
We were able to see quite a few different maps inside.

4718
03:09:23,200 --> 03:09:24,240
So that was fun as well.

4719
03:09:24,560 --> 03:09:26,240
And I downloaded a lot of...

4720
03:09:26,240 --> 03:09:29,460
Wait, did it save my photos from...

4721
03:09:29,460 --> 03:09:29,980
Hold on.

4722
03:09:31,320 --> 03:09:31,820
Victory!

4723
03:09:35,160 --> 03:09:36,000
Thank you guys!

4724
03:09:36,120 --> 03:09:38,460
Sorry I couldn't read super chats or everything.

4725
03:09:38,920 --> 03:09:40,140
It was so much...

4726
03:09:41,080 --> 03:09:47,280
It's one of those games where you can't really look at chat much because I'm like, constantly like, where's the stalker?

4727
03:09:47,520 --> 03:09:48,620
Where's the headcrab?

4728
03:09:48,920 --> 03:09:49,440
Where's this?

4729
03:09:49,520 --> 03:09:50,120
Where's that?

4730
03:09:50,480 --> 03:09:52,720
The kaiju parts were actually super hyped thanks to the collab.

4731
03:09:52,960 --> 03:09:53,380
Yeah!

4732
03:09:53,600 --> 03:09:54,260
Thank you!

4733
03:09:56,020 --> 03:09:56,980
It was fun though.

4734
03:09:56,980 --> 03:09:59,620
It was fun, fun, fun.

4735
03:10:00,080 --> 03:10:01,580
Anyway, I'm hungry.

4736
03:10:01,760 --> 03:10:03,160
I'm gonna go eat some dinner.

4737
03:10:05,180 --> 03:10:06,220
So, um...

4738
03:10:06,220 --> 03:10:07,720
I hope you guys enjoy the rest of your day.

4739
03:10:07,800 --> 03:10:09,420
The rest of your night.

4740
03:10:11,060 --> 03:10:12,800
Happy Chocolate Minday Mindo!

4741
03:10:13,020 --> 03:10:14,920
Thanks for the silly, fun silly game.

4742
03:10:15,220 --> 03:10:16,940
Happy Chocolate Minday!

4743
03:10:22,500 --> 03:10:23,020
Burger.

4744
03:10:24,100 --> 03:10:25,500
Maybe that's what I'll have.

4745
03:10:25,500 --> 03:10:27,060
I don't know what to have yet.

4746
03:10:28,940 --> 03:10:30,280
Maybe a sandwich.

4747
03:10:30,760 --> 03:10:31,220
I don't know.

4748
03:10:32,680 --> 03:10:33,320
Otsumito!

4749
03:10:35,460 --> 03:10:36,280
Thank you guys!

4750
03:10:36,580 --> 03:10:37,760
See you later!

4751
03:10:38,380 --> 03:10:39,180
Bye bye!
