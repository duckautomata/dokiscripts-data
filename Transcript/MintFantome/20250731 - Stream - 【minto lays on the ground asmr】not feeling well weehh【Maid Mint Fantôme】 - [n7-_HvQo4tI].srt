1
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,220
Hello, everybody from the floor...

2
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,140
Actually, wait, let me put my phone... I'm reading chat from my phone.

3
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,540
You can barely hear me, I don't know.

4
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:38,640
Wait.

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,100
Is it louder?

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,180
Is it better?

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,480
It's quiet.

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,520
Slightly.

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,140
What if I put it here?

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,820
What if I put it here?

11
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,260
Is that better?

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,180
And I don't know if I was before.

13
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,190
Is it okay?

14
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,050
I can't have floor time.

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,200
Do I need to... turn it up, maybe?

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,240
Hold on, let me get up.

17
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,440
Eww.

18
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,360
I can't see my computer, so I don't know if it's...

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:03,140
I don't know if it's... if it's... if it's... good.

20
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,940
Oh, it's good now.

21
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,740
Hello, everybody.

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,640
Welcome to me.

23
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,120
I'm on the floor.

24
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,740
And you might be wondering why... what's happening.

25
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,560
It's because...

26
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,560
Take it easy.

27
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,420
Thank you, Mimi.

28
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:30,440
It's because... I... I got... I was all dizzy, shaky... earlier.

29
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,440
Uh... and so I've just been laying on the floor for like...

30
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,560
Um...

31
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
Um...

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,420
Like...

33
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,080
Um...

34
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,200
Um...

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,520
Um...

36
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,460
Maybe, like, the past...

37
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,220
Two hours.

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,800
I've just been on the floor.

39
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,660
I'm feeling a bit better now.

40
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,520
Luckily.

41
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,860
I...

42
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,060
I...

43
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,460
Had some... fruit.

44
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,360
Yummy!

45
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,420
Oh, she sounds so...

46
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,740
Small and pathetic.

47
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,500
Thank you.

48
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,540
Thanks.

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,320
Yeah.

50
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,620
But I'm feeling a bit better.

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,320
I just thought I would be...

52
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,540
Still pretty low energy...

53
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,380
For...

54
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,140
The game.

55
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,820
If I did a normal stream.

56
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,440
But I did not want to stream.

57
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,400
So here I am on the floor.

58
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,320
And I would encourage you to also join me...

59
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,340
On the floor.

60
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,700
You know...

61
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,320
You ever just lay on the floor.

62
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,540
Oh my gosh.

63
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,100
Game control.

64
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,340
Thank you for the pink.

65
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,720
Thank you.

66
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,880
I say ASMR.

67
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,500
It's only because...

68
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,540
I'm just gonna be chillin'.

69
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,420
It's...

70
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,740
It's not like a...

71
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,520
It's not...

72
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,180
There's no excitement here.

73
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,100
I'm on the floor.

74
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,680
The floor is comfy.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,240
Extract my electrolytes.

76
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,840
Oh, I have been drinking.

77
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,600
Many electrolytes I have.

78
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,180
Don't worry.

79
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,680
I don't know.

80
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,140
Usually once I...

81
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,300
Once I eat...

82
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,380
I feel better.

83
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,140
But I...

84
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,020
It took a really long time.

85
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,560
It took like...

86
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,220
A really long...

87
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,820
Like two hours after I ate.

88
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,780
For me to...

89
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,220
Start feeling.

90
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,020
Actually...

91
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,340
It really wasn't until the fruit.

92
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,460
Yeah.

93
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,040
You gotta mop before you lay on the floor.

94
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,340
Luckily...

95
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,060
You know...

96
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,180
I keep my floor...

97
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,280
Well...

98
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,380
The maid cafe...

99
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,900
It's a little dusty.

100
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,600
Roses are red.

101
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,500
It's hot today.

102
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,220
Make me in those pain.

103
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,300
Go away.

104
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,040
The best way to cure any illness is laying on...

105
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,980
Nice cold bathroom floor.

106
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,860
That's so true.

107
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,980
One of those standing desks that descends all the way to the floor.

108
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,040
That's a good idea.

109
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,540
Give a minute.

110
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,140
Thank you.

111
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,580
I'm okay.

112
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,820
Thank you guys.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,760
I really appreciate it.

114
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,260
I'm okay.

115
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,540
I just...

116
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,620
I didn't...

117
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,260
I still...

118
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,280
I still...

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,020
I still...

120
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,720
I still wanted to talk to you guys.

121
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,960
I still wanted to talk to you guys.

122
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,400
It's not so much to ask.

123
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,460
And so I decided I'll lay on the floor and do it.

124
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,160
Do the cats visit you on the floor?

125
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,960
Nobody has visited me yet, unfortunately.

126
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,720
Can we join you on the floor?

127
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,360
Yes!

128
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,460
Yes!

129
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,500
I encourage...

130
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,420
I encourage floor activity.

131
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,620
Parafloral activity.

132
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,260
How do you thank you so much for the vibe gifted?

133
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,540
That was pretty good.

134
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,180
You have to...

135
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,500
You have to admit.

136
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,640
Sagrada Familia Cathedral in Barcelona.

137
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
And the English audio guide sound exactly like...

138
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,900
Donna Burke.

139
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,360
It might be her.

140
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,960
It might be.

141
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,920
Even though she melts on the floor, she thinks of us.

142
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,580
Yeah.

143
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,360
I'm thinking of you.

144
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,640
On the floor.

145
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:19,640
On the floor.

146
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,100
What of it?

147
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:20,700
Hmm?

148
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:22,920
Hmm?

149
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,600
Laying on the floor, too.

150
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,820
Nice.

151
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,240
Parafloral.

152
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,280
Can we get much higher?

153
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,540
Parasocial?

154
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,480
No, I'm paranormal.

155
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,460
I'm paranormal.

156
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:50,980
Supernatural.

157
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,200
I was not familiar with your cake game.

158
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,580
Oh!

159
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,240
Oh, yeah.

160
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,560
Oh, yeah.

161
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,280
It's like the one thing I do have.

162
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,880
Is my fat booty.

163
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, my gosh.

164
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,740
I could go for...

165
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,180
Do you guys know that snack?

166
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,180
Pirate's booty?

167
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,660
I could go for that right now.

168
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,840
That sounds pretty yummy.

169
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:15,860
That sounds pretty yummy.

170
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,100
Do you guys know it?

171
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,840
It's like...

172
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,540
It's like...

173
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,540
It's like...

174
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,780
White...

175
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,720
Cheddar...

176
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,900
Is it cheddar?

177
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,680
White...

178
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,560
It's like a cheese.

179
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,540
But...

180
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,620
Like a white cheese.

181
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,900
It's like Cheetos.

182
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,020
Hi, paranormal.

183
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,380
Hi, paranormal.

184
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,500
I'm abby-normal.

185
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,530
Never heard of it till now?

186
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,250
Oh, my gosh.

187
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,310
I recommend.

188
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,110
It's like more of a subtle flavor.

189
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,310
And it doesn't make you feel like you're eating...

190
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,230
You know...

191
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:56,930
Radioactive...

192
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,610
Like...

193
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,270
Cheetos.

194
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,270
I'm at work so I can't join the floor gang.

195
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,550
Well, you could...

196
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,950
Re-listen to this and be on the floor with me.

197
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,150
When you get home.

198
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,010
I'm readjusting.

199
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,350
Sorry.

200
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:12,970
Is it crunchy?

201
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,030
Yeah, it's crunchy.

202
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,310
Yeah.

203
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,160
Work on the floor.

204
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,920
Mm-hmm.

205
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Laying in Beth.

206
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,580
In Beth.

207
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,780
Laying in my Beth.

208
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,120
I'm laying in my Beth.

209
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,620
No, I'm laying on the floor.

210
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,080
Freaky ghost Beth.

211
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,400
Now...

212
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,320
This is a good time to go to sleep, maybe.

213
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,380
Unless it's morning for you.

214
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:57,880
I don't know.

215
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,160
I could go back to sleep.

216
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,160
Second sleep.

217
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,780
What's my favorite jelly?

218
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,880
I'm at the Japanese Mart looking at the shelf.

219
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,600
I don't think they...

220
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,560
What is it?

221
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,540
In Japan?

222
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,520
I don't think they sell it in the States, unfortunately.

223
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,320
But it's...

224
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,000
The...

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,740
What's it called?

226
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,560
Manmaru?

227
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,940
Minmaru?

228
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,860
Manmaru Life.

229
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,540
Grape Cognac Jelly.

230
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,040
Grape Cognac Jelly.

231
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,020
It's my favorite one.

232
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,280
Aye!

233
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,660
My Nan Life.

234
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,500
Sasuga Murphy.

235
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,140
How do you remember?

236
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,720
My Nan Life.

237
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,300
What are my symptoms?

238
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,220
I feel silly.

239
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,500
I feel a little silly.

240
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:46,580
I feel a little silly.

241
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,420
But yeah, Grape Cognac Jelly is my favorite.

242
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,780
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

243
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
That's contagious.

244
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:55,640
Yes.

245
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,040
Uh oh.

246
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,600
You're gonna catch the silly.

247
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,020
It's terminal.

248
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,100
How do you think I died?

249
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,860
Shady and Octus, thank you.

250
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,220
Folding clothes...

251
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,120
Laying on the floor.

252
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,920
Folding clothes.

253
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,050
I hate folding clothes.

254
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,800
Yeah, me too.

255
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,220
You two return my new name.

256
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,580
What is your new name?

257
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,340
What is that?

258
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,820
Died of Silly.

259
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,240
Sorry if it's quiet, that's probably me.

260
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,940
Cause I'm not talking very loud, I'm on the floor.

261
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,860
Great minto of the floor, what is your wisdom?

262
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,460
I think everybody should lay on the floor for a couple of minutes a day.

263
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,140
Yeah.

264
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,180
Silly's got a hold of us all now.

265
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,080
Yeah, you can get a doctor's note for that.

266
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,380
You can say like, hey.

267
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,800
Hey.

268
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,000
Can't come in.

269
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,480
Hey.

270
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,460
Hey.

271
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,100
Hey.

272
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,100
I caught the Silly.

273
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,160
Hey.

274
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,940
Everybody would just think you're...

275
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:29,540
Being...

276
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:30,600
Very...

277
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,440
Being so...

278
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,440
Kind.

279
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,270
Being so...

280
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,320
Thoughtful that you're...

281
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,520
Looking out for everybody else's well-being.

282
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,770
Are you a tea drinker whilst ill?

283
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:56,380
I'm a tea drinker 24, 7, 365 days a year.

284
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,880
There isn't a moment I'm not drinking tea.

285
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,080
My gamer sups with your code came in the mail today.

286
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,440
What'd you get?

287
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,000
Assembling a wardrobe that took...

288
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,120
Oh my god.

289
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,760
I just heard the stream labs.

290
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,380
Mateo, thank you!

291
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,740
Floor gang.

292
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,580
I heard Spongebob come...

293
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,860
I don't have my headphones in.

294
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,900
I don't...

295
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,360
You guys probably couldn't hear it.

296
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,780
Wait, I'm scared to drink tea?

297
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,840
Kidney stone.

298
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,220
What?

299
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,520
Wait, what?

300
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:37,940
Wait.

301
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,220
Oh, donos are muted?

302
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,140
Oh, that's okay.

303
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,220
I can hear it.

304
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,720
Wait.

305
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,580
Kid...

306
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,940
What do you mean kidney stones?

307
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,800
From...

308
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,960
From tea.

309
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,820
Huh?

310
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,040
Huh?

311
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,500
I guess if you're dehydrated.

312
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,820
Oh.

313
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,800
Oh.

314
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,600
Sugar tea will give you kidney stones.

315
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,600
If you have kidney stones, go to Disney World.

316
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,740
Go ride Big Thunder Mountain.

317
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,160
Sit on the seat very last of the roller coaster.

318
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,420
And it will...

319
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,660
It will dislodge.

320
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,160
This is a real thing.

321
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,800
It's real.

322
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,620
It's real.

323
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,100
I learned it from TikTok.

324
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,460
I learned it from TikTok.

325
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,240
But...

326
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,940
But actually, apparently, that is a real thing that some people do.

327
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,460
Is they...

328
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,220
They go to...

329
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,520
They go to...

330
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,420
Thundermount in a Disney World and...

331
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,180
Or Disneyland.

332
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,260
I don't actually know which one it is.

333
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,500
And then they...

334
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,200
And then they...

335
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:07,940
Uh...

336
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,520
It will help the kidney...

337
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,600
Kidney stone...

338
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,840
Dislodge.

339
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,060
The Florida one specifically.

340
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,740
Really?

341
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,680
I don't know.

342
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,940
Actually, how do you...

343
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,640
How do you get rid of a kidney stone usually?

344
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,520
Jeffrey, happy birthday!

345
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,640
Happy, happy birthday!

346
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,780
Sorry, I missed it.

347
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,660
Dr. Minky is not a medical doctor.

348
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,620
Yes, I am.

349
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,400
American healthcare movie.

350
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,160
Hehehehe.

351
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,520
Hehehehe.

352
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,660
I don't know though.

353
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,700
Prices to Disney are so expensive.

354
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,580
You'll probably...

355
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,160
Spend so much there.

356
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,780
As much as a doctor, right?

357
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,200
Logan, also thank you so much for the 10 gifted...

358
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,080
Thank you!

359
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,020
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

360
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,160
Getting on every ride at Disney and going...

361
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,300
Is this the kidney stone removal ride?

362
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,180
Yeah!

363
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,860
Oh, there's this thing at Disney.

364
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,600
It's called...

365
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,200
Pixie dusting.

366
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,220
Like...

367
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,500
And it's when...

368
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,620
It's when, like...

369
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,860
I guess a staff member does something kind to you.

370
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,200
Like, uh...

371
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,120
Maybe they'll let you have a fast pass for free.

372
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,700
Or...

373
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,000
They'll let you...

374
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,820
Meet a certain, like, character or something.

375
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,040
So people will be like...

376
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,280
Oh my god, I went to Disney and...

377
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,200
I got pixie dusted.

378
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,780
Oh my gosh, it was so...

379
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,940
It was like a dream.

380
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,320
It's supposed to be like a magical moment, you know?

381
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,260
But you could go...

382
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,940
And you could say...

383
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,060
Oh my god, I got pixie dusted.

384
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,520
My kidney stone...

385
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,880
Dis...

386
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,220
Dis...

387
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:58,660
Dis...

388
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:58,700
Dis...

389
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,020
Thank you, Walt!

390
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,520
What

391
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,070
a...

392
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,950
What a magical moment!

393
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,150
Kidney dusted.

394
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,250
How magical!

395
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,350
Thank you!

396
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,330
Thank you, Walt!

397
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,350
Thank you so much!

398
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,030
Does Disney World accept most health insurance for the ride?

399
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,350
Maybe.

400
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:33,990
Probably.

401
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,630
Disneyland traumatized me.

402
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,050
Uh-oh.

403
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,290
Nine, did you go on...

404
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,310
Mr. Toad's wild ride?

405
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,370
Do you guys know that ride?

406
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,610
Mr. Toad's wild ride?

407
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:43,930
Okay.

408
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,470
I've never seen the movie.

409
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,030
I've never seen the movie, but...

410
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,730
It's about a guy, Mr. Toad.

411
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,030
And...

412
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,590
He...

413
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:54,990
Um...

414
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,110
He...

415
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,930
Gets into some crazy antics, and then he gets sentenced to jail.

416
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,970
No, sorry, not jail.

417
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,170
Death penalty.

418
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:03,870
No.

419
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,010
Maybe jail.

420
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:05,930
I don't remember.

421
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:13,030
But he breaks out of the prison, and he gets hit by a train, and then he goes to hell.

422
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,990
And that's the end of the ride.

423
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,390
If it was painless, then it was actually magical.

424
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:28,630
I probably would be more painless, because you're riding the coaster, you don't even notice it, probably.

425
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,250
I'm not a doctor.

426
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,610
Have you seen all the custom voice-back request messages?

427
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:36,530
Uh...

428
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,710
He has sent them to me.

429
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,850
I have not had a chance to start on them yet.

430
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,750
I was going to start tomorrow.

431
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,230
Mm-hmm.

432
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,990
Does Mr. Toad help with kidney stones?

433
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:51,550
No.

434
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:53,550
No.

435
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:53,610
No.

436
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,590
The adrenaline suppresses the pain.

437
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,330
Probably.

438
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,330
Yeah.

439
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

440
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,590
Yeah.

441
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,350
I get a lot of...

442
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,450
I'm on TikTok.

443
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,830
I get a lot of theme park TikToks.

444
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,650
I get a lot...

445
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,170
Oh my gosh.

446
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:19,970
You guys.

447
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,030
The new epic universe has opened.

448
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,750
The park...

449
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,030
It's an extension of Universal in Florida.

450
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,170
And...

451
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,270
And...

452
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,970
All I'm getting though...

453
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,050
I was excited to see the rides.

454
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,550
The roller coasters especially.

455
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,450
There's a one...

456
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,810
It's like a dueling star racer.

457
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,210
I can't remember if that's the name.

458
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:48,850
But...

459
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,850
Mm-mm.

460
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:51,990
Death...

461
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,990
Death of Rock.

462
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,030
A.K.A.

463
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,710
Koban.

464
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,590
Happy birthday!

465
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,670
Thank you so much.

466
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,650
Happy, happy birthday!

467
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,570
The original idea of Disneyland was that you were the main character in the movie when you ride.

468
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,550
So actually you die and go to hell with Mr. Toad.

469
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,630
Oh...

470
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,810
That makes more sense.

471
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,730
Sorry your body has betrayed you again, Minto.

472
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,170
Also having a stone dislodge isn't necessarily a blessing.

473
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,510
That's when the real pain begins.

474
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,610
I don't want to think about it.

475
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,570
I'm sorry.

476
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,910
But...

477
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,890
Epic Universe.

478
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,470
I was excited to see all the roller coasters.

479
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,010
And instead, I keep getting thirst traps.

480
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,150
I keep seeing the invisible man.

481
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,190
And he is literally lusting over every lady.

482
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,590
This man has so much charisma.

483
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,310
I...

484
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,630
And I can't...

485
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,080
I can't stop seeing all the girlies fawning over this guy.

486
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,300
Just being like...

487
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,840
It's the invisible man.

488
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,560
And he like...

489
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,920
He'll like come up and he'll like take the back of his hand and like stroke the person's face.

490
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,260
You know?

491
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,920
Stuff like that.

492
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,040
What?

493
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,200
Listening while drowning.

494
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,360
Don't drown.

495
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,480
Don't drown.

496
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:17,940
No.

497
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:18,520
No.

498
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,000
Kidney stones get peed out.

499
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,240
Or the roller coaster.

500
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:26,560
Yeah.

501
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,040
Procedure or roller coaster.

502
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,560
Those are your only options.

503
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,480
Not very invisible if you keep seeing him.

504
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,720
The only invisible man I know is Duran Duran.

505
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:51,720
Is not bad.

506
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,550
You can't always leave...

507
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:21,590
Yeah, 100% from the Metal Gear Solid 5 soundtrack.

508
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,010
Yes.

509
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:26,830
Encore!

510
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,190
That's exactly as I remembered.

511
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,450
Why aren't you feeling well?

512
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,870
My Bukos levels are low, I think.

513
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,690
I'm a little... I'm a little woozy.

514
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,290
I kinda wanna go to the Godzilla rides...

515
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,410
Say, in the amusement park.

516
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,050
It is a combat orchestra.

517
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,030
It is a combat orchestra?

518
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,390
What is that, touring?

519
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,420
Boob levels down.

520
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,540
Never.

521
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,140
You can eat.

522
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,160
I did eat.

523
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:08,860
I did.

524
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,440
That's why I was so like, I'll be fine.

525
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,780
And then, I was not fine.

526
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,260
Did you ever heard of you took a kid?

527
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,620
It was the James Bond theme Durandera.

528
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:20,980
Wait.

529
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,060
The only...

530
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,040
Okay, I'm gonna be honest.

531
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,470
The only James Bond theme that I remember is...

532
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,750
I'll die.

533
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,050
Another day.

534
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,570
Guess I'll die.

535
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,130
Another day.

536
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,070
Marco, thank you.

537
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,270
My gamer subs merch got delivered today.

538
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,090
The cup is super cute.

539
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,630
Can't wait to use the mousepad as a playmat next time I play magic.

540
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,130
Thank you.

541
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,330
Thanks for ordering.

542
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,790
Mint on the floor.

543
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,610
I hope you're well and you feel more minky soon.

544
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,810
Next stream, I will 100% be okay.

545
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,050
But, I will probably have to push...

546
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,630
Load Runner to next week.

547
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,610
I'm sorry, guys.

548
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,710
I'm sorry.

549
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,650
I'm sorry.

550
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,270
I'm sorry.

551
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,250
It's funny.

552
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,590
I didn't even notice that I was doing multiple Runner games in a row.

553
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,850
Blade Runner.

554
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:13,930
Load Runner.

555
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,150
That's it.

556
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,130
That's it.

557
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,750
Mint is stinky.

558
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,710
Maybe...

559
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,030
Booty Runner.

560
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,150
Dang.

561
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,510
Booty Runner.

562
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:38,870
Hold on.

563
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,410
I'm gonna...

564
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,650
I'm gonna move.

565
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:41,770
Yeah.

566
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,530
Wait.

567
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,670
Oh, I can't reach out if I look this way.

568
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,550
Okay, hold on.

569
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,330
I'm moving you guys too.

570
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,250
Mint of the floor.

571
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,450
What is your wisdom?

572
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,330
Um...

573
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,010
More wisdom?

574
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,490
Temple Runner next.

575
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,270
Temple Run.

576
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,390
Cookie Run.

577
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,650
Give me all your running games.

578
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,650
I'm now a...

579
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,790
I'm a run tuber.

580
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,130
We're running.

581
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,050
Can you watch my dog?

582
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,370
Can you watch my dog?

583
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,730
I can't even watch chat.

584
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,140
I'm so sorry.

585
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,540
I'm sorry.

586
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,700
Load Runner was from 1994.

587
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,800
I think we'll be okay to wait one more week.

588
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,460
Are you sure?

589
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,320
Oh, wait.

590
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,120
Let me...

591
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,900
Let me take off this.

592
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,220
It might help with the sound.

593
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,820
Is that better?

594
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,880
I realize I'm probably a little...

595
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,380
Oh?

596
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,360
What am I hearing?

597
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,540
Am I hearing myself?

598
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:43,940
Oh?

599
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:44,840
Oh?

600
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,140
Oh?

601
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,520
Maybe?

602
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,160
It's about the same.

603
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,340
Can't tell.

604
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:57,610
Echo?

605
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:58,610
Echo Echo.

606
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:58,690
Oh?

607
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,130
I hate anime.

608
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,850
And don't like VTubers.

609
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:12,730
Wait...

610
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,890
But you are my exception because...

611
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,010
Both because of my love for Metal Gear.

612
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:21,890
Yeah.

613
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,370
Watching you slowly descend to and continue across two lifetimes.

614
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,830
Also, what the hell is an...

615
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,410
Oshii.

616
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,950
Oshii.

617
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,750
Oshii.

618
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,830
Oshii.

619
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:34,970
Oshii.

620
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,630
Oshii.

621
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:35,970
Oshii.

622
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,830
Oshii just means...

623
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,290
Like...

624
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,830
Okay, so...

625
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,770
Thank you!

626
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,410
Thank you, pirate.

627
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,430
Runner game.

628
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,890
Uma Musume Pretty Derby running game, yeah.

629
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,130
Oshii means like...

630
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,770
Push.

631
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,650
For everybody.

632
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,830
Actually wondering.

633
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,070
My dog's name is Maggie.

634
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,090
So it's like a...

635
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,830
You know...

636
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,190
You're right, grass, but it's also a different kanji.

637
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,410
Different kanji.

638
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,790
But it means like the person...

639
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,950
It's your favorite member because you're wanting to push them to...

640
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:22,690
The top.

641
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,390
Poop.

642
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,730
Poop to the top.

643
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,570
Poop to the top.

644
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,950
Poop to the top.

645
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,630
Ghostrunner 1 and 2.

646
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,250
I got my gamer subs recently and the design is certainly interesting.

647
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:36,510
Interesting.

648
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,830
What do you mean?

649
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,570
Push, push.

650
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,330
Push, push.

651
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,390
Me, when I push, push my Ushi's butt to the top.

652
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,370
Yeah, it's like the one time I give you permission.

653
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:52,810
You may push.

654
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,550
You may push.

655
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,750
Yeah, yeah, that's the kanji.

656
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,550
Right there.

657
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:02,950
Yay!

658
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,290
Heave ho!

659
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:08,250
Why?

660
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,470
It's not that heavy, I think.

661
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,250
I don't know.

662
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,210
What are you going to do with all that junk?

663
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,210
All that junk inside that junk?

664
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,630
I'm going to get you to the top.

665
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,950
Get my Ushi up, up, up.

666
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,550
That's my Ushi's humps.

667
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,510
My Ushi's lady lumps.

668
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,530
Check them out.

669
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:34,610
Because she is my Ushi, I want you... Wait, what was I saying?

670
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,410
Oh, no.

671
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,310
Hold on.

672
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,430
Sorry.

673
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,390
Sorry.

674
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,570
Let's go.

675
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,050
Sorry if my karaoke song request yesterday was rude.

676
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,050
No, no.

677
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:58,370
I think... I think Matthew more so is like... What's the word?

678
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,330
It wasn't rude.

679
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,650
It's just...

680
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,730
And this, I think, goes for, like, a lot of streamers.

681
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:16,490
Like, I feel really bad if I'm in a collab with people and someone says it's their birthday and it's kind of hard for me to, you know, either see it or wish them a happy birthday in the moment.

682
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:22,810
Um... I think if you're ever requesting something like that, it would be better for, like, this kind of stream.

683
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,490
Like, a talking stream or, um...

684
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,030
You know, even karaoke.

685
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:34,210
So that... When I do karaoke streams, if someone requests a song and I'm...

686
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:39,510
I will usually write it down when I have the moment, you know?

687
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,730
But at the time, I didn't have the moment, you know?

688
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,870
So I think that... Oh, sorry.

689
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,110
I almost just dropped my phone.

690
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,190
I think that goes for...

691
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,290
For...

692
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,670
Pretty much any streamer, you know?

693
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:52,970
Mm.

694
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,650
Yeah, yeah.

695
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,850
But don't worry.

696
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,390
You're all good.

697
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,670
It's hard to remember sometimes, you know?

698
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,330
When you're watching and you just kind of want to...

699
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,230
I feel the most bad, especially because it's like...

700
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:14,690
If someone sends it as a super chat, like, I feel bad because...

701
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,670
Like, example, again, like a birthday.

702
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,250
If I do it during a collab, it's...

703
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,670
I feel... I feel more bad, you know?

704
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:24,850
Nah.

705
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,090
Yeah.

706
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,070
Yeah.

707
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,230
That's it.

708
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:37,050
My Oshi brings all the wisps to the yard, and they're like...

709
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:37,730
Oh.

710
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,170
My Oshi's got bars.

711
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,970
That's my Kami Oshidi, y'all.

712
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,350
Y'all.

713
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,970
Don't drop me.

714
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,990
I can't afford to lose brain cells.

715
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,460
She do got bars.

716
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,240
Any VTubers you'd like to collab with.

717
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,190
I...

718
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,150
Would love to collab more with Henya.

719
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:18,830
Yeah.

720
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,610
I'd like to collab more with Henya.

721
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,890
I like her.

722
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:39,110
She's my VTuber Kami Oshi.

723
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,550
Collab with JPEG dog.

724
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,110
Oh yeah, he's the best VTuber.

725
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,870
Fun fact, you're bald underneath all your hair.

726
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,650
If only you knew.

727
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,350
If only you knew.

728
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,530
Bouncing her DMs, Dayo.

729
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,710
I'm shy.

730
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,210
Usually I'm not good with...

731
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,930
Going to people.

732
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,890
Just help push...

733
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:07,950
You're on your way, boss.

734
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,930
Manto, could you...

735
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,570
Could you do your best, Dayo?

736
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,070
I'm always doing my best, Dayo.

737
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,470
Oh, wait.

738
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,470
I thought you meant like...

739
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,770
Wait.

740
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,410
I thought you meant like, do your best, Dayo.

741
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,910
Instead of like, do your best, Dayo.

742
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,330
Uh...

743
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,410
Dayo.

744
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,450
Yeah.

745
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,870
I'm listening while donating plasma.

746
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,790
I can't donate plasma.

747
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,870
Because they don't...

748
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,770
Accept ectoplasma.

749
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,070
I guess I could for ghosts.

750
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,870
But I'm so scared of needles.

751
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,170
I pass out.

752
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,590
I pass out.

753
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,270
I took my minto plushie to see Ado yesterday.

754
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,250
And the guy next to me recognized you.

755
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,130
What?

756
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,850
Oh my gosh.

757
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,410
Oh my gosh.

758
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,910
Skiblippers, Dayo.

759
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,530
Wait, that's crazy.

760
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,270
Did you guys become friends?

761
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,490
Did you guys kiss?

762
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,730
What if we kiss during Usewa?

763
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,950
Mwase, mwase, mwasewa.

764
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,690
Mwase, mwase, mwase, mwase.

765
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,970
Mwase, mwase, mwase.

766
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:35,230
Mwase, mwase, mwase.

767
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,470
I got the timing for you.

768
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,530
Just follow along, okay?

769
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,910
Mwase, mwase, mwase.

770
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,370
That's even better.

771
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,570
Okay, that's for people that don't want to...

772
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,070
That don't want to kiss a lot.

773
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,030
But then you can say...

774
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,290
Mwase, mwase, mwase.

775
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,890
There's two different versions.

776
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,750
They're both...

777
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,470
They're both good.

778
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,390
They're both valid.

779
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,250
Mwase, mwase.

780
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,210
That was so funny.

781
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,500
Wink, winky.

782
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,960
Got my Minto G-sharp's cup today.

783
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,200
Thank you.

784
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,900
Thank you, Artemis, for ordering.

785
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,740
And thank you.

786
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,380
Thank you.

787
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,960
Romance option.

788
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,960
You have to get a higher social link for romance at the auto concert, I guess.

789
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,820
Are wisps required to kiss when we meet in the wild?

790
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,720
I just think it's a little exciting, though.

791
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,860
When you get so excited.

792
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,480
When you're just like, oh my gosh.

793
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,900
You're a wisp.

794
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,240
I'm a wisp.

795
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,660
You know?

796
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,740
Any updates on the second wave of plushies?

797
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,480
They should be shipping out now.

798
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,800
I've seen people starting to get them.

799
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:31,420
If you are curious, if you are not sure, you can email MossoBox.

800
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,640
Yes, yes.

801
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:39,180
I unfortunately do not handle any of the shipping, so I cannot help you.

802
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,760
Does your cafe serve miso soup?

803
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,920
Could you cook me miso soup every morning?

804
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,160
Hey.

805
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,840
Hey now.

806
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,480
I know what that is.

807
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,440
Do you guys know what that is?

808
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,800
If someone asks you, could you make...

809
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,580
Or, oh no.

810
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,340
They say, I...

811
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:05,980
Uh, wait.

812
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,280
They ask you...

813
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,720
Wait.

814
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,900
They say, can you serve me...

815
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,140
No.

816
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:12,760
No, no.

817
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,120
They say, I want...

818
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,180
They say, I want to eat your miso soup every day.

819
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,680
And that is, apparently, a marriage proposal.

820
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,860
Keep trying, queen.

821
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,010
It's as, like...

822
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,820
It's up there with...

823
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,160
It's up there.

824
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,060
Marriage.

825
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,070
When you...

826
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,000
When...

827
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,070
When you...

828
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,340
I couldn't remember if it was, like...

829
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,220
Ask...

830
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,140
You to...

831
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,960
Uh...

832
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,860
Make it?

833
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,120
Or, if I...

834
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,320
If they say, I want to eat it.

835
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,260
I don't remember.

836
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,100
I don't know.

837
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:56,500
I don't know.

838
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,780
I guess it's the same thing, though.

839
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,800
Old-timey Japanese proposal.

840
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,840
Taking notes for my next minto meat ingredient.

841
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,980
I have miso soup.

842
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,300
It's called...

843
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,620
I can get it from the sewer.

844
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,900
Kissing causes pregnancy.

845
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,000
Don't do it.

846
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,220
The real question is, do you accept it?

847
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,620
Uh...

848
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,280
Oh...

849
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,600
Well, you know, I'm a cafe.

850
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,460
I'm a cafe, so, like...

851
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,700
You...

852
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,200
You would pay me to make it every morning.

853
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,080
You know?

854
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,960
I'm a mid-cafe, yeah.

855
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,480
So...

856
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,340
If you...

857
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,260
Pay the...

858
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,960
The price of the soup?

859
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,220
Yeah, I'll make it every morning.

860
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:50,960
You just come in.

861
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,020
That's illegal.

862
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,740
What do you mean?

863
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,080
This is an establishment.

864
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,700
Is this the Krusty Krab?

865
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,600
Is this the Krusty Krab?

866
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,420
The soup toe.

867
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,080
How much?

868
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,640
I don't know.

869
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,120
How much is, like, a bowl of miso?

870
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,420
100 yen?

871
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,620
200 yen?

872
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,060
Fancy miso.

873
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,100
300 yen.

874
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,940
10 dollars?

875
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,040
Holy moly.

876
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,640
What am I putting in there?

877
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,140
Gold?

878
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,920
Complimentary.

879
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,800
At least 350.

880
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,340
I'm gonna put...

881
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,400
What do you want in it?

882
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,680
I like my miso soup with spranch.

883
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,940
I like some spranch in there.

884
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,280
Soup is legal.

885
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,300
They can't take that away from us.

886
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,300
For now.

887
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,700
For now.

888
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,500
I hope you feel better soon.

889
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,300
Thank you, Ellie.

890
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,080
Thank you so much.

891
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,220
Spranch.

892
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,630
Spranch.

893
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:01,850
Spranch.

894
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,350
Miso corn soup?

895
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,550
Does that even exist?

896
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,850
Would it taste any good?

897
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,230
Probably not.

898
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,970
Probably would be bad.

899
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,850
How long have I been streaming?

900
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:17,210
Okay.

901
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,910
Is it illegal to say gyoza?

902
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:21,990
Yes.

903
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,890
Now you're going downtown.

904
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,590
Wait, I said gyoza too.

905
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,970
I said it again.

906
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,190
I'm going downtown.

907
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:31,090
Okay.

908
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:31,950
I arrest you.

909
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:32,770
You arrest me.

910
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:34,790
Okay?

911
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,090
Okay.

912
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:37,750
Wait.

913
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,350
I arrest you first.

914
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,070
Alright.

915
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:40,650
Turn around.

916
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,090
Handcuffs.

917
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:43,130
Ka-chang!

918
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:44,130
Alright.

919
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,050
Now I turn around.

920
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,370
Handcuff me.

921
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,330
I would like to order a Krabby Patty with Diet Kelp.

922
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,370
Who was driving?

923
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:54,830
Who was driving?

924
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:58,850
Uh...

925
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,770
Mmm...

926
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:02,390
Uh...

927
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:10,510
If I'm here, and you're there, then who was fun?

928
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,450
Where we could share handcuffs?

929
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,750
What are you trying to say?

930
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,990
That you have itty bitty tiny wrists?

931
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:19,930
Oh my god.

932
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,670
My wrists are so small.

933
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:26,110
I could like share handcuffs with you.

934
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,910
Because my wrists are so skinny.

935
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,330
Oh my god.

936
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:33,990
I have like the tiniest wrists ever.

937
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,270
Sharing handcuffs.

938
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,230
Scandalous.

939
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,570
Play Umamu.

940
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,630
I mean Ace Combat.

941
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:42,670
Good night!

942
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,540
That wasn't what he meant.

943
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,360
Oh, what do you mean?

944
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:53,860
Wait.

945
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,780
Now I don't know.

946
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,700
Everybody, time to do your...

947
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,980
Floor stretches.

948
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,240
Oh my...

949
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,900
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

950
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,780
Thank you, thank you.

951
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,070
Big stretch.

952
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,530
I wonder if I could eat this mic.

953
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,370
Good stretch.

954
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:43,650
Sorry.

955
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:44,790
Sorry.

956
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,030
Sorry.

957
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,050
Sorry, sorry.

958
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:00,940
Sorry.

959
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,170
Thank you.

960
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:05,430
Thank you.

961
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,310
Thank you for the five gifted.

962
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,890
Bite the mic.

963
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,570
Please no Minto E2 ASMR.

964
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,890
Oh yeah, that's what's supposed to be ASMR.

965
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,610
It's laying on the floor ASMR.

966
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,370
Do you feel it?

967
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,790
Do you feel like I'm...

968
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:25,750
On the...

969
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:25,910
Wait.

970
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:26,570
Hold on.

971
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:27,330
Let me get up.

972
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,470
I'll make it ASMR.

973
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:28,990
Hold on.

974
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:29,970
Hold on.

975
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:30,350
Hold on.

976
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,870
Oh my gosh, you guys.

977
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:42,990
I realized something.

978
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,430
I know why the mic is so weird.

979
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,410
Give me a second, actually.

980
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,350
Hold on.

981
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:49,970
Oh.

982
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:51,630
Hold on.

983
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,050
Test, test, test.

984
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,390
Test, test, test, test, test, test.

985
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,050
Test, test.

986
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,590
I realized...

987
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:15,310
I realized it was settings for my other mic.

988
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,050
Sorry.

989
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,030
Is it too loud?

990
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,150
How about this?

991
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:20,930
Is it okay?

992
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,160
It was on the setting for my other mic.

993
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:31,940
Sorry.

994
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,110
Okay, hold on.

995
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,070
That's why it sounded probably weird.

996
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,150
Um.

997
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:48,510
Hello.

998
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,870
It sounded really low.

999
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,800
Minto.

1000
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,240
I'm in your left ear.

1001
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,440
Now it's like I'm really laying on the ground.

1002
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,460
And I'm inside your left ear.

1003
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,720
Ugh.

1004
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,080
Sorry.

1005
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,360
My nose is really runny.

1006
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,040
I think it's...

1007
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,240
I think it's all my ectoplasm...

1008
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,240
From my brain...

1009
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,900
Going down.

1010
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,480
Yeah.

1011
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,280
Now I'm haunting your left ear.

1012
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,720
On the ground.

1013
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,860
The left ear says...

1014
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:48,820
Wait.

1015
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,860
The left side of the brain is...

1016
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,440
The mathy side.

1017
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,400
And the right side is the creative side.

1018
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,440
Actually, I don't remember.

1019
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:58,980
Which is which?

1020
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,780
I only have my right earphone in.

1021
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,380
Uh-oh.

1022
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,270
My nose is so stuffy.

1023
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:19,510
Why?

1024
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,790
Probably because I'm laying on the floor.

1025
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,570
And I'm probably...

1026
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,650
Inhaling all my cat...

1027
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:26,290
Hair.

1028
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:27,030
You know.

1029
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,910
I just vacuumed.

1030
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,710
I think I'm allergic to my cats.

1031
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,670
I think...

1032
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:36,650
I think I'm...

1033
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,130
Allergic to my cats.

1034
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,730
So I...

1035
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:41,010
Uh...

1036
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:44,030
I have stuffy nose.

1037
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:45,570
Naiminto.

1038
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:46,210
Good night.

1039
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:47,010
Thank you.

1040
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,470
Thank you.

1041
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:48,770
Thank you.

1042
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:48,910
Thank you.

1043
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,590
Worst fear is a pet owner.

1044
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,310
I know.

1045
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:56,750
I know.

1046
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,130
But I don't think it's like...

1047
00:44:59,130 --> 00:44:59,990
Super serious.

1048
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:01,170
Wait.

1049
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,430
Thank you so much for the gift.

1050
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:03,010
Thank you.

1051
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,390
Do your eyes get itchy?

1052
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,130
Sometimes.

1053
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:09,750
If I like...

1054
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:10,450
You know...

1055
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:10,750
Okay.

1056
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,350
You only know this if you have a cat.

1057
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,470
But sometimes you just want to like...

1058
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,150
Just sniff their head.

1059
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:17,050
You know?

1060
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,510
I never...

1061
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,390
My sister when she had a baby...

1062
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:21,170
She was like...

1063
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,670
I just want to sniff their head.

1064
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:23,730
I was like...

1065
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,790
What are you talking about?

1066
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,290
But I just want to do that to my cat.

1067
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,730
Why are you sniffing a human baby?

1068
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:34,190
She's like...

1069
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,530
It has baby smell.

1070
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:38,450
But with cat...

1071
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:39,990
Sometimes I don't even go for the head.

1072
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,550
Sometimes I go for the back.

1073
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,130
And I'm like...

1074
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,130
Yeah.

1075
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,050
That's the stuff.

1076
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:48,090
There's this...

1077
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:48,430
What is it?

1078
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:49,310
The tox...

1079
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,050
Toxoplasmosis.

1080
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,250
I don't remember.

1081
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,670
I don't know what it is.

1082
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:57,350
But it's like...

1083
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,410
Something you get from your cats.

1084
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:01,410
That makes you...

1085
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,390
Toxoplasmosis.

1086
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:07,290
It makes it that you are...

1087
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,850
Sick in the head for your cat.

1088
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,410
I'm sick in the head for my cat.

1089
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,630
I'm sick in the head.

1090
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:17,330
Okay.

1091
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:18,630
I'm going to go to the right side now.

1092
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,180
Okay.

1093
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,140
Then we'll come.

1094
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:43,940
Ectoplasmosis.

1095
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,260
Sick in the head for me, though.

1096
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:47,700
Yeah.

1097
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,140
You get ectoplasmosis.

1098
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,760
You get ectoplasmosis.

1099
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,540
Get ectoplasmosis right now.

1100
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:54,760
Ectoplasmosis.

1101
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,660
I'm injecting it into your brain.

1102
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,600
Into your bloodstream.

1103
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,600
Into your DNA.

1104
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,040
Ectoplasmosis.

1105
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,540
For generations and generations and generations.

1106
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,240
Sick in the head.

1107
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,560
Sick in the head.

1108
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:08,860
Sick in the head.

1109
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,260
True.

1110
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,560
And real.

1111
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,760
True and real.

1112
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:18,580
Fox.

1113
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,160
Ecto.

1114
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,780
Ecto die.

1115
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:31,270
I can't keep getting up, you guys.

1116
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:33,490
I got up this last time and...

1117
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:34,650
I got...

1118
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:35,850
I got really dizzy.

1119
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:37,070
So...

1120
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:38,750
I'm stuck on the ground.

1121
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:41,690
I'm stuck on the ground.

1122
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,170
Yeah, we're on the floor still.

1123
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,430
Is this how wisps are made?

1124
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,150
Yeah, probably.

1125
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,010
Yeah, probably.

1126
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:58,630
Hmm.

1127
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,110
I might be sleeping here.

1128
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,630
I might be sleeping here.

1129
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:07,510
Right side minto.

1130
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:10,110
What's your opinion on left side minto?

1131
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,430
Left side minto is a bitch.

1132
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,690
She can't even open a pickle jar.

1133
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,390
But me, I got all the muscle.

1134
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,270
I'm brains and prime.

1135
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,090
She's a little weenie.

1136
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,250
Don't trust left side minto.

1137
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:33,510
She's a weenie.

1138
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:37,390
Do you have water and snacks on the floor?

1139
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,470
I do have...

1140
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:39,030
Oh my gosh.

1141
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,630
I have some liquid IV.

1142
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,890
That stuff is ass.

1143
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:45,870
Liquid IV tastes so bad.

1144
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,510
I hate it.

1145
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:51,870
It's so gross.

1146
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:53,930
It's...

1147
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,130
It's...

1148
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:58,170
It's like the worst flavor ever.

1149
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,610
The flavor of peach.

1150
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:04,470
I have peach flavor and you'd think it would be good.

1151
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,110
But it's so gross.

1152
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,170
It's so nasty.

1153
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:10,470
Most...

1154
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:12,350
Just most flavors suck.

1155
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:13,490
What do you guys recommend?

1156
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:16,910
What do you recommend for the...

1157
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:17,650
For...

1158
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:18,610
For...

1159
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,210
For liquid IV.

1160
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,010
It's supposed to rehydrate, not taste good.

1161
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,010
They could do both.

1162
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,950
Real gang wars.

1163
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:30,690
Right side minto versus left side minky.

1164
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:32,410
Minky.

1165
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:32,470
Minky.

1166
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,210
Lemon lime.

1167
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,810
I don't think you could go wrong with that.

1168
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:42,450
Pedialyte.

1169
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,350
Oh yeah.

1170
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:44,410
Blackberry peach.

1171
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,610
It also has caffeine.

1172
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:46,010
Wait.

1173
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,890
Do all liquid IV have caffeine?

1174
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:50,810
Uh-oh.

1175
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:51,970
I've heard...

1176
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,350
I've heard good things about the Pedialyte.

1177
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:56,950
But I always thought it was for babies.

1178
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:58,570
Because of the name.

1179
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,430
Did you ever get that minto drink from Off-Kai?

1180
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:04,270
No.

1181
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:08,710
But I was told that it had like crazy levels of alcohol in it.

1182
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,390
I would probably...

1183
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:12,910
I would be...

1184
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,350
I think I would still be drunk if I...

1185
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:16,910
If I...

1186
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:19,130
If I drank it...

1187
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,450
I would be drunk to this very day.

1188
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,670
There's a Pedialyte for adults.

1189
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:26,030
Wait.

1190
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:26,570
Is it...

1191
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:27,530
So it is for babies.

1192
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:33,790
Coconut milk or Pedialyte.

1193
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:34,410
Both are good.

1194
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:35,430
Coconut milk?

1195
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:36,870
Yummy.

1196
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:40,390
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

1197
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,790
Made of the floor.

1198
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:43,650
What is your wisdom?

1199
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,410
Don't drink liquid IV.

1200
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:47,470
It tastes like...

1201
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,250
Butt.

1202
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:49,610
It's so bad.

1203
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,570
I don't know why it's so bad.

1204
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:55,790
I don't know.

1205
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,990
It's more for kids than babies.

1206
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,120
Okay.

1207
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,420
I was...

1208
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:13,660
I...

1209
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,780
I will...

1210
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,340
I have some power...

1211
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,620
Powerade too.

1212
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,560
But I was like...

1213
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,060
Oh, well I have this liquid IV.

1214
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,900
I know it's so bad.

1215
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,360
But I should just get through it.

1216
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,040
I can't do it.

1217
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,980
Bro, I can't do it.

1218
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,880
It's so bad.

1219
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,480
Bro, I can't...

1220
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,080
I can't drink the liquid IV.

1221
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,640
It's so...

1222
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,080
Damn, bro.

1223
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,560
Bro.

1224
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,720
Bro, I can't...

1225
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,440
I'm too weak for liquid IV.

1226
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,460
No.

1227
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,100
No.

1228
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,880
How do you put it in my...

1229
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,220
I even put it in the...

1230
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:00,660
In the giant Gamersupps bottles.

1231
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,240
I do it with that.

1232
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,300
So it's a lot of water.

1233
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,800
And still...

1234
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,080
Still...

1235
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,720
Still...

1236
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,760
Have you tried Pocari Sweat?

1237
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:14,720
Yeah.

1238
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,100
I like Pocari.

1239
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:17,740
I like Pocari Sweat.

1240
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:18,800
I like Aquarius.

1241
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:23,000
They don't sell Aquarius in the States though, do they?

1242
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,400
But I do like Pocari.

1243
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,300
Mmm, yeah, yeah.

1244
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,160
Those are tasty, yeah.

1245
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:39,990
And you can get Pocari...

1246
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,390
Like, mixture too.

1247
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:43,430
I think.

1248
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:46,030
Ah.

1249
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,440
Don't know so you can buy a better drink.

1250
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,840
I just didn't wanna...

1251
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,640
I'm not...

1252
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,780
I don't wanna be wasteful.

1253
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,780
I bought the liquid IV.

1254
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,000
The liquid ID.

1255
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,400
Brother.

1256
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,240
I became liquid.

1257
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,020
I stole his social security number.

1258
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,440
Actually, that guy probably doesn't have a social security number.

1259
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,320
But, um...

1260
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,740
I don't wanna wait.

1261
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,500
I bought it.

1262
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,220
The liquid IV.

1263
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,540
I only have, I think, one more packet of it.

1264
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,680
So I just gotta...

1265
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,380
I just gotta do it.

1266
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,660
Maybe I'll give it to some sap.

1267
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,380
Maybe I'll give it to some sucker.

1268
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,560
I'll be like, yeah.

1269
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,960
Try this liquid IV.

1270
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,760
Oh, it's really good.

1271
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,740
Drink taxes paid.

1272
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,720
Thank you.

1273
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:47,560
Nice.

1274
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,380
We'll try it.

1275
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:48,740
Yeah.

1276
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,420
Send it to Matara.

1277
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,020
I'll send it to Mataracon.

1278
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,920
Here, Matara.

1279
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,560
This will make you feel really hydrated and good.

1280
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,820
Slightly used liquid IV.

1281
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,100
That's diabolical.

1282
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,120
You guys are evil.

1283
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,240
You guys are...

1284
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,650
You guys are so evil.

1285
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:28,110
I'm gonna get arrested for shipping powder and through the mail.

1286
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:33,290
They're gonna be like, what is this, anthrax?

1287
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,010
Oh, liquid IV.

1288
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:35,810
That's worse.

1289
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:46,150
FBI.

1290
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:47,910
I'm gonna get swatted.

1291
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,210
Help you feel better soon.

1292
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:55,910
Thank you.

1293
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,810
Suckers born every minute.

1294
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:02,470
True.

1295
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,350
Even when dying on the floor.

1296
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:06,510
I mean, they're so cute.

1297
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:07,050
Really?

1298
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:09,550
Thanks.

1299
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:12,590
I'm like... I'm serious.

1300
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:15,030
I look exactly like my thumbnail right now.

1301
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:19,070
That's exactly how I'm laying.

1302
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,230
Just like my thumbnail.

1303
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:27,950
Oh, yeah.

1304
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:32,570
Cake and all.

1305
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,770
You know it, baby.

1306
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,400
You hear that?

1307
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:39,700
Did you hear that?

1308
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,800
Booty up.

1309
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:55,840
If your allergies are kicking in, it can be the swelling of your inner ear and make you dizzy.

1310
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,320
I... Oh my gosh.

1311
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:03,240
I can't have the antihistamines because it makes me pass out.

1312
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,760
But I will take some tonight.

1313
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:05,700
That's a good idea.

1314
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:06,320
Thank you.

1315
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,580
Good.

1316
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,940
Good idea, Jester.

1317
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:10,740
Thank you.

1318
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:16,500
Okay, you want more... more drum power?

1319
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,060
Wait, what should I... what should I play?

1320
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,880
This is karaoke now.

1321
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,580
What song should I play?

1322
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,180
Oh wait, I know.

1323
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,400
Well...

1324
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,030
Oh wait, how's it going?

1325
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:09,770
Oh.

1326
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:14,350
Nothing will ever take me away from you.

1327
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:20,350
This is kind of a workout.

1328
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,430
This is kind of a workout.

1329
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:26,210
I'll bless the rains down in Africa.

1330
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:51,680
Okay, now you have to change the thumbnail to make them red.

1331
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,840
Rickroll us next, please.

1332
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,220
Oh.

1333
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,480
We're no strangers to love.

1334
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,640
You know no rules, and so do I.

1335
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,180
This is definitely the beat.

1336
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,840
That's definitely...

1337
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,140
That's definitely the beat of...

1338
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,080
That we're gonna give...

1339
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,360
That's exactly what the drum man's doing.

1340
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:43,590
He's just going...

1341
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,630
On the drums.

1342
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:48,610
No.

1343
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,550
Sage, thank you so much for the five gifted.

1344
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:55,210
Thank you!

1345
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,150
I'mma play umo musume.

1346
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:58,710
Have fun!

1347
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:06,530
I'll take cake every morning instead of soup.

1348
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,710
Hold on, I'm gonna move a bit again.

1349
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:11,590
Hold on, sorry.

1350
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:13,930
Wait...

1351
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:15,650
Wait...

1352
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:16,150
Wait, hold on.

1353
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:17,670
Hold on.

1354
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:26,290
Hold on.

1355
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,900
I think it might be time for me to...

1356
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:37,960
To...

1357
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,200
To leave.

1358
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:43,230
I think so.

1359
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:46,630
I think so.

1360
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,390
Yeah.

1361
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:49,710
Okay.

1362
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:51,950
Well I'm glad that we could have this talk.

1363
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,870
On the floor.

1364
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:55,350
And...

1365
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,030
You guys...

1366
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:01,810
Sorry I've been in your right ear for a while.

1367
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:02,330
Sorry.

1368
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:05,750
This was a good chat.

1369
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:06,790
You know.

1370
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:08,650
You guys take care.

1371
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:10,030
Um...

1372
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:12,050
Roll on the floor a little bit if you want.

1373
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:13,850
And...

1374
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,650
I'll see you guys when I see you next!

1375
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:16,950

I have to get up though.

1379
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,630
I have to get up!

1380
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:27,250
I don't want to get up.

1381
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:28,590
Okay, okay.

1382
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:30,650
Okay.

1383
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:33,170
Okay.

1384
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,600

1386
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:47,620
Thank you everybody.

1387
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:49,580
Oh...

1388
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,680
Every time I get up...

1389
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,480
The world...

1390
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,900
Goes black.

1391
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:54,560
Hold on.

1392
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,340
Oh...

1393
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,700
I am so sorry you guys.

1394
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,880
I really didn't expect to feel this bad today.

1395
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:06,960
I didn't expect to feel this bad today.

1396
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:08,420
Oh...

1397
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:08,680
Okay.

1398
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,020
I'm okay though.

1399
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,300
I had a lot of fun.

1400
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,180
Thanks you guys.

1401
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,040
For making me...

1402
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,480
Feel better.

1403
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,300
Okay.

1404
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,580
See you later.

1405
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,200

1406
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,080
Out!

1407
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,600
That's me digging back into the dirt.

1408
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:28,460
Okay.

1409
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:28,800
Bye-bye.

1410
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,200
Bye-bye.

1411
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:29,300
Okay?
