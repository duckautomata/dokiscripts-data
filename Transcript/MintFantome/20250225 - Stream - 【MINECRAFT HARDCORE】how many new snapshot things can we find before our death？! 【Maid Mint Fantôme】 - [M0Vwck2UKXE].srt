00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,300
Welcome back, master and princess!

2
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,840
Hello!

3
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,540
Hello, howdy.

4
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,540
Howdy doody.

5
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:28,740
Hello!

6
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,300
We're here.

7
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,040
Here we go again.

8
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,480
But...

9
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,560
Not really.

10
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,860
I think.

11
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,260
It's like...

12
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,240
I just wanna explore.

13
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,300
And...

14
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,820
And...

15
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,240
What's the word?

16
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,930
Have some stakes in it.

17
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,130
You know?

18
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,030
I wanna explore in hardcore.

19
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,590
That's what I'm saying.

20
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,650
I wanna have some stakes.

21
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:05,750
You know?

22
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,230
If I die, I'll never know.

23
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,090
But I wanna see this thing.

24
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,270
See the spooky woods.

25
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,190
The pale woods.

26
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,550
And I wanna see the fireflies.

27
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,190
And I wanna see the new cows and the new pigs and the new chickens.

28
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,850
Stakes are yummy.

29
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,410
Stake.

30
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,250
That title screen is a good omen if I've ever seen one.

31
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,430
What is it?

32
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,630
I thought it was supposed to be like a reference to...

33
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,210
What's the word?

34
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,530
Lord of the Rings?

35
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,510
Where he's like, run, you fool.

36
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,010
But I actually don't understand the reference.

37
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,470
My daughter Kasumi is sick and you wish her well.

38
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,470
Get better, Kasumi!

39
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,910
Help me feel better.

40
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,470
Energy beam!

41
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,520
Oh, fly, you fools.

42
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,720
Oops, sorry.

43
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,220
I'm not... I'm a fake Lord of the Rings fan.

44
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,340
Don't let Mike distract him.

45
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:12,840
Stop.

46
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,460
February 24th is my birthday, so please sing me a birthday song, Mito-chan.

47
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,820
I love you today, too, Kouyuu-chan!

48
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,220
Thank you so much!

49
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,520
Happy birthday!

50
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,400
Happy birthday to you.

51
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,520
Happy birthday to you.

52
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,420
Happy birthday, dear Kouyuu-chan.

53
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,180
Happy birthday to you.

54
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,880
Happy birthday!

55
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,580
Happy birthday!

56
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,940
It's a very, very old game called Sinistar.

57
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,760
Oh, I see, I see.

58
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,040
I see, I see, I see, I see.

59
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,680
Yesterday was my 30th birthday, the 23rd.

60
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,680
Fast food, happy belated birthday!

61
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,700
One more time!

62
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,380
Happy birthday to you.

63
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,580
Happy birthday to you.

64
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,520
Happy birthday, dear Vasude.

65
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,460
Happy birthday to you.

66
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,580
Happy birthday!

67
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,500
Spank, thank you so much for the 20 gifts.

68
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,440
So, guys, let's ignore this.

69
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,100
I just was, like, exploring.

70
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,920
I was just exploring, but today we're going to make a new world.

71
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,440
The new world will be called Newer World.

72
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,960
Just exploring, just exploring.

73
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,920
And I was also trying to...

74
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,320
I saw some videos of, like, things to make in Minecraft, so I wanted to test it out.

75
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,580
What's experiments?

76
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,400
The music is so strange.

77
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,220
Yeah, newer means better.

78
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:18,940
Always.

79
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,960
What's experiments?

80
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,660
Like, human?

81
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,860
Wacky world settings.

82
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,180
Experiments are potential new features.

83
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,420
Be careful, as things might break.

84
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,620
Experiments can't be turned off after world creation.

85
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,880
Oh, updated trades for villagers.

86
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,700
Improved movement for minecarts.

87
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,180
I don't think I'll ever use these, but I guess we can try it.

88
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,660
Oh, Newer World.

89
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,820
We've already upgraded.

90
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,600
Yeah, I just felt like playing some Minecraft, but I don't have, like, a server or anything that I...

91
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,900
that I can explore in, so...

92
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,160
Oh!

93
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,760
Are you kidding me right now?

94
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,830
I was about to say, oh, wow, we're in a dark wood.

95
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,250
Oh!

96
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,030
Guys, if this ain't some streamer luck nonsense going on here...

97
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,750
Look, even the sky becomes gray.

98
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,170
If this isn't some streamer luck nonsense...

99
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,470
Give us the seed.

100
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,170
How do I give the seed?

101
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,330
I hear an eerie noise.

102
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,210
Darn, she's good.

103
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,730
Oh, I hear eerie noises.

104
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,610
It's so creepy.

105
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,150
I forgot about music because I was listening to Minecraft music.

106
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,930
What do I do now?

107
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,350
Oh, slash seed.

108
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,990
There you guys go.

109
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,590
There you go, everybody.

110
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:41,410
If you would like to spawn into your own world immediately with the pale world right next to you...

111
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:42,790
Dozo.

112
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,290
Punch wood.

113
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,130
Yeah.

114
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,110
What is this biome called again?

115
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,610
Pale garden.

116
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,330
Well, I gotta get some, like...

117
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,170
I have a question, if anybody knows.

118
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:07,910
Do monsters still spawn in here besides the creaking?

119
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:15,570
Or, like, is it one of those kinds of biomes where nothing else can spawn except him?

120
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:16,350
Yes?

121
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,870
Oh, golly.

122
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,330
Okay, we gotta get some...

123
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,450
I can't believe it.

124
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:23,690
I was ready.

125
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,170
I was so ready for our epic adventure.

126
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,270
Imagine I'm also beating this.

127
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:35,990
And we get the heart of the little guy, the creaking man, too.

128
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,910
I can't believe it right now.

129
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,170
And it's huge.

130
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,490
It's ginormous.

131
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,570
I hear stuff.

132
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,070
Oh, I hear stuff.

133
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,550
And there's a second part even.

134
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,490
How am I supposed to tell when it's night?

135
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,770
Or turning to night, everything's so gray.

136
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,270
I can't, I'm so, I'm stun-locked right now.

137
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,790
I'm stun-locked.

138
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,290
Just like London.

139
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,290
So true.

140
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,720
So nice of them to make...

141
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,030
Not to turn, you know, the UK into a biome.

142
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,910
And look, here's the other one.

143
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,350
I saw like a little, what's it called?

144
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,890
Oh wow, there's even a thing underneath.

145
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,110
Oh,

146
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,670
this scene is amazing!

147
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,070
What?

148
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,150
Oh my gosh.

149
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,030
I, I kind of want to start over.

150
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,550
Like, I, I feel like...

151
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,960
I feel like I should die and start over.

152
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,640
Because it was too easy!

153
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,800
What the heck?

154
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,220
Oh my gosh, I need to get food.

155
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,380
But there's no animals anywhere in sight.

156
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,700
We got some logs.

157
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,800
Let's go find some food.

158
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,580
And, oh, food!

159
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,140
Sorry, sorry, your food.

160
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,100
Oh wait, hold on, let me make a sword.

161
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,660
Or something.

162
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm so, I'm so shocked.

163
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,700
I'm shooketh, literally.

164
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,980
So, oh, stick.

165
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,600
Sword.

166
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,640
Alright, here we go.

167
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,500
Come here and dinner.

168
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,900
He's not even an interesting color, uh, chicken.

169
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,860
Like, I thought they changed the colors of the chickens.

170
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,900
Let's do... you.

171
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,640
I, wow, wow, and it's like surrounded!

172
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,380
Oh my gosh, all this green in the midst of the, the gray.

173
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,400
Wow, oh no, it's burning.

174
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,720
It's burning up!

175
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,920
Okay.

176
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,540
Great landscape.

177
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,140
Yeah, for real.

178
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,200
Uh.

179
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,040
Oh wait, actually, hold on, I'm gonna make a shovel too.

180
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,700
Oh wait, I need more stick.

181
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,300
And shovel.

182
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,140
And we'll make a pickaxe too.

183
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,640
Yeah, we'll make, we'll make everything.

184
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,400
We'll make everything.

185
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,280
I was about to say, oh, there's a lush cave too.

186
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,900
And then we came into the, the whole area of it.

187
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,760
Because I saw the tree.

188
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,580
The little green tree.

189
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,660
Let's try and go around to the other side.

190
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,260
It's so quiet.

191
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,320
Should I put on music?

192
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,540
Oh, the flowers!

193
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,800
These light up at night!

194
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,740
Wait, I'm taking one.

195
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,900
I've been sick!

196
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,960
Why are you sick?

197
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,900
Since I got back from Japan, I've been vodgaing for the past week.

198
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,420
But I want to tell you I love you, have a safe trip to Japan.

199
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,820
Thank you!

200
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,220
Feel better, Ashes!

201
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,840
Pirate pop quiz?

202
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,700
Oh no, okay.

203
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,060
What be a pirate's favorite letter?

204
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,620
I know this one!

205
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,740
Arr!

206
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,080
Uh, hold on.

207
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,740
Ooh, I hear the creaking!

208
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,600
I hear the creepy noise!

209
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,600
Oh my god, there's an axolotl!

210
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,780
Oh, there's some iron.

211
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,240
Let's grab it.

212
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,300
Let's grab it.

213
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,300
Some good, good, good.

214
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,880
No, it's E?

215
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,420
Oh.

216
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:10,980
Matey.

217
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,440
Wait, can I...

218
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,900
Do I need a...

219
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,160
Wait.

220
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,030
Do I need a...

221
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,100
Do I need a thing?

222
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,500
Hello Minto, can I get a happy birthday?

223
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,840
Happy birthday!

224
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,820
How do I say your name?

225
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,940
Dekotob?

226
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,160
Wait.

227
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,000
Happy birthday to you.

228
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,660
Happy birthday to you.

229
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,800
Happy birthday, dear Dekotob.

230
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,500
Happy birthday to you.

231
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,960
Happy birthday!

232
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,120
Time to walk the plank.

233
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,020
Everyone knows that a pirate's favorite letter is the C!

234
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,780
Well, um, I guess...

235
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,760
I guess I gotta walk the plank.

236
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
How many do...

237
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,200
Oh, I need more stick.

238
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,900
Stick.

239
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,640
Stick.

240
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,500
Wait, how do you do stick?

241
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,400
Stick.

242
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,200
All right, U.

243
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:13,720
All right.

244
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,360
And so far, we look like we're good on time.

245
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,240
Nice.

246
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,060
Iron this early is so good.

247
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,160
Let's go.

248
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,780
Did you guys see the axolotl over there?

249
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,060
And there's...

250
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,680
We can probably go down and get some of the coal that's out around there too.

251
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,260
Oh, I'm gonna put on BGM.

252
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,640
I thought the BGM would...

253
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,880
I don't know what's wrong with me.

254
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,700
I think I played once and the BGM was like almost consistent.

255
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:49,420
So I was like, oh, I think they adjusted the BGM to be more all the time.

256
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,400
And so I was like, oh, okay, we're just gonna have...

257
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,620
I'll just play a BGM.

258
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,280
I don't know.

259
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,520
We'll do this.

260
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,160
Okay.

261
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,660
Cool.

262
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,140
He's down there!

263
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,060
He's down there.

264
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:19,940
All right.

265
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,180
I'm going through.

266
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:22,920
I'm going in.

267
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,400
We'll make...

268
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,640
What's it called eventually?

269
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,520
A...

270
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,000
I mean, I gotta make a house.

271
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,320
I gotta make a bucket.

272
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,400
I gotta get more iron.

273
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,520
I see coal.

274
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,820
We gotta get coal.

275
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,940
I could just jump into the water, but...

276
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,800
All right.

277
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,660
What if I make this my home?

278
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,160
The home of the creaking.

279
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,000
There's a little fish in here.

280
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,040
Ah!

281
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,340
And me.

282
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,260
Oh, gosh.

283
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,300
There he is!

284
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,100
He's so cute.

285
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,160
All right.

286
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,120
I saw coal over here.

287
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,080
Let's go grab this.

288
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,280
I gotta make my food.

289
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,200
True mountain home.

290
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:15,640
Yeah.

291
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,300
Hopefully there's nothing in here.

292
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760
I'm scared.

293
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,820
Nothing spawn, please.

294
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,020
Nothing spawn, please.

295
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,720
Wait.

296
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,600
Torch.

297
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,340
We'll just make some immediately.

298
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,460
All right.

299
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,780
All right.

300
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,600
All right, we're good.

301
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:36,900
Okay.

302
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,760
What do I do now, you guys?

303
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,400
We were supposed to go on an epic adventure and now we're just...

304
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,400
We're here.

305
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,580
What do we do?

306
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,800
Thank you so much.

307
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,020
Thank you.

308
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,380
If you find a cute animal, can I ask you to name it something funny?

309
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,660
I suppose we can.

310
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,960
We already found an axolotl.

311
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,480
Beat the ender dragon.

312
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:05,920
Okay.

313
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,000
Okay, you guys...

314
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,760
I'm no Minecraft veteran anymore.

315
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,410
Wow, this is a huge...

316
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,520
vein.

317
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,980
This is perfect.

318
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,440
How did we get so lucky?

319
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,440
How did we get so lucky?

320
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,800
Uh-oh, it's starting to get dark though.

321
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,560
And I don't have a bed or anything.

322
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,700
What do I do?

323
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,900
Where do we go?

324
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,500
I'm so scared.

325
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,340
I only have one food.

326
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,100
Let's see.

327
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,080
Let's make a...

328
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,190
Let's make...

329
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,010
What's a furnace?

330
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,110
Now, welcome...

331
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,410
to our abode.

332
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,630
The great...

333
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,950
Minto...

334
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,390
place.

335
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,350
Hopefully nothing spawns.

336
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,630
And...

337
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,670
It's our...

338
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,330
It's the hole.

339
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,910
Yeah, it's our little...

340
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,090
It's our little hidey hole.

341
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,730
And we're fine, probably.

342
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,710
Look, I can set these up and they'll be lit.

343
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,970
Or I...

344
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,190
Oh!

345
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:35,810
Awaken!

346
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,690
It's nighttime.

347
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,390
Nevermind.

348
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,230
I'm gonna put this right here.

349
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,090
We're just gonna...

350
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,770
Put this here on top of it.

351
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,650
Wow, very trendy.

352
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,090
Everybody's doing this now.

353
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,430
And...

354
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,610
I don't need tropical fish.

355
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,490
We'll cook our iron and we'll cook our food after.

356
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,290
And we'll start digging.

357
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,670
We're just gonna start digging out our new home.

358
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,670
More iron!

359
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,430
Oh my gosh.

360
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,470
How did we get so lucky?

361
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,690
I was so ready to traverse the world.

362
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,550
Now I don't know what to do.

363
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,530
I was like, okay, I'll find the creaking and then I'll...

364
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,610
I mean, technically, I haven't found the creaking guy.

365
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,590
He's out there though.

366
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,170
He's above me literally at this very moment.

367
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,510
Is this seed blessed?

368
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,190
Maybe.

369
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,250
He's out there creaking.

370
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,430
That's so mean.

371
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,510
You can't just call...

372
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,290
You can't just call, you know, 30 year olds the creaking.

373
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,490
Thought I should ask an expert going to a concert in Japan next week and heard of...

374
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,570
Concert earplugs.

375
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,110
Are these normal for lives in Japan?

376
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,330
Oh, that's a great question.

377
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,210
Honestly, they are not.

378
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,010
At least for idol shows.

379
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,430
I never see anybody wearing them.

380
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,850
But I would...

381
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,010
Especially if you go to a small show.

382
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,750
100% recommend them.

383
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,870
I always wear them at small shows.

384
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,990
Actually, thank you for reminding me because I'll need to...

385
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,910
I need to...

386
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,410
What's a word?

387
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,030
I need to...

388
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,410
I need to pack mine.

389
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:43,790
But...

390
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,490
But...

391
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,730
Yeah, I would definitely recommend wearing them.

392
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:49,990
Bigger shows too.

393
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,790
But I feel those ones aren't usually as bad as like the small venue places.

394
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,530
Because at the small venue ones, they just...

395
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,990
They just crack that music so loud.

396
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,690
It's so, so bad.

397
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,510
But usually at bigger venues, it's not so bad.

398
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:08,570
Dort!

399
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,100
Let's make our food.

400
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,320
Oh, not quite yet.

401
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,860
Dort.

402
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,660
Have fun!

403
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,380
Yeah, it's really...

404
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:38,020
I regret having never used more like the earplugs...

405
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,280
Uh, long ago.

406
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,450
All right, we got...

407
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,530
We got one food.

408
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,090
Our only...

409
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:51,990
Our only snack.

410
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:52,770
Our only meal.

411
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,170
Is there anyone out there?

412
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,830
I mean, the creakings out there, we know for sure.

413
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,710
That guy.

414
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,470
How many of them are there, you think?

415
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,610
Just got back from a trip and have to catch up on vibes.

416
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,150
But want to know something odd that was happening because of Minecraft movie.

417
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,630
Warner Bros started to copyright a bunch of videos using Minecraft music.

418
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,310
But it's fine now, I think.

419
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:12,690
What?

420
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,290
No way.

421
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,790
Oh wait, um...

422
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,150
Take this back.

423
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,970
Make more torch.

424
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,990
I'm so...

425
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,610
I'm kind of salty about my flowers not blooming.

426
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,450
Oh, there's more axolotls.

427
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,170
Wait, so there's axolotls out there, but there's no...

428
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,470
Like, creepers and things?

429
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,450
I don't want to accidentally destroy the ecosystem at the moment.

430
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,770
Maybe later.

431
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,410
But at the moment, I don't want to, you know.

432
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,250
But we're...

433
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,090
I mean, we're really high up anyway, so...

434
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,630
There was like a new...

435
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,970
What's it called?

436
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,630
Trailers of the Minecraft movie.

437
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,950
It's just...

438
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,830
What's...

439
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,970
What is it about?

440
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,290
It's finally my birthday!

441
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,210
Blue's Clueless.

442
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,110
May pretty please get a mother base happy birthday.

443
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,110
Of course!

444
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,370
Happy birthday, congratulations.

445
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,790
Happy birthday, with salutations.

446
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:33,450
Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue.

447
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,650
Happy birthday to you.

448
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,210
Happy birthday, Blue's Clueless!

449
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,010
The Midcraft movie.

450
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,610
Yeah, they probably...

451
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,110
The flowers probably don't work in...

452
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:53,650
In caves.

453
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:54,690
You're probably right.

454
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,130
I'm still gonna be...

455
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,190
Sad about it, though.

456
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,110
We'll just have to hold...

457
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,550
We'll just...

458
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,950
We're in this tiny hole.

459
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,770
We're in our hidey hole until daylight.

460
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,030
Until we can get a few more resources.

461
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,530
Maybe I can even make armor.

462
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,250
Well, I gotta make tools first.

463
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:12,750
Like iron...

464
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,230
Axe and...

465
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,870
I'm getting ahead of myself.

466
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,670
Oh, there it is.

467
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,250
There it goes.

468
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,990
J'mon G3.

469
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,980
I think there's anything out there.

470
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,950
The creaking is out there somewhere.

471
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:37,930
Lurking.

472
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,690
She's out there.

473
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,070
No one's in my cave yet, though.

474
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,950
Well, this area is actually...

475
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,710
Oh, there's a creeper.

476
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,010
I just saw him go down the water slide.

477
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,350
I was gonna say this area is pretty empty, actually.

478
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,330
All things considered.

479
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,010
Surprising.

480
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:00,970
Hot dog.

481
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:01,470
Hot dog, indeed.

482
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,550
Logan, thank you so much for the tank gift!

483
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,210
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

484
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,530
Have you seen the Minecraft movie Steve Figure?

485
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,870
It's literally just a Jack Black figure.

486
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,650
Which makes sense, but it's still funny.

487
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,630
Oops, I forgot to make a new pickaxe.

488
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,210
That's so lazy.

489
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,450
That's so bad.

490
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,270
It's awesome.

491
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,710
Do you think...

492
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,190
Okay, let's see.

493
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:32,950
We have 11.

494
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,470
This takes two, so we'll make a sword.

495
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,490
Oh, no!

496
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,790
I do feel like we need some iron...

497
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,210
Some...

498
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,350
Some armor, though.

499
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,870
The sun is rising!

500
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,230
Nice.

501
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,330
Default Jack.

502
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,150
Default Jack Black.

503
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,970
I'm just...

504
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,930
So curious what the movie will be like.

505
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,010
Will I go see it?

506
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,430
Most likely not.

507
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,970
Maybe it will be...

508
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,290
Maybe it will exceed all of our expectations, which are currently none.

509
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,390
Seeing it for the FOMO?

510
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,810
I don't think I would have...

511
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,150
I mean...

512
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,910
I don't think I have a FOMO.

513
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,050
I even hate watch.

514
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:30,990
I'm still watching it.

515
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,830
If it's accidentally good...

516
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,290
See, part of me is just like...

517
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,390
I love Jack Black so much.

518
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,730
I don't want to believe that anything he's in could be bad, but...

519
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,450
This just doesn't...

520
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,190
It's just not hitting.

521
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,430
There it is.

522
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:51,770
Okay.

523
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,410
Yearn for the minds.

524
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,710
Okay, it's probably daylight now.

525
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,890
We could probably leave.

526
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,170
I remember not being too excited about the LEGO movie.

527
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:06,610
See?

528
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:06,690
See?

529
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:07,830
Exactly.

530
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,070
It could be very similar.

531
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,250
Like I said, we just need to see it exceed our expectations.

532
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,010
Just a little bit.

533
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:17,850
Ouch!

534
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,350
Okay, let's go find some food.

535
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,290
And light up this area a little bit.

536
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,170
Is that creeper gone?

537
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,090
Please say yes.

538
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,370
Also, I'm gonna put...

539
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,630
I'm gonna put these out here too.

540
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,810
Gosh, this area is so difficult.

541
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:41,690
Oh, can I not?

542
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,550
Okay, we can put it on the moss.

543
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,030
Maybe it'll work.

544
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:47,610
We'll see.

545
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,830
It's our little pathway back home.

546
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,130
I think he's gone.

547
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,530
Also, there was one other thing I really wanted to see.

548
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,970
And that was the firefly bushes, you guys.

549
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,610
We have to find the firefly bushes.

550
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,790
That's important to me too.

551
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,430
Mario movie?

552
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

553
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,070
Everyone said...

554
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,990
Everyone booed the Mario movie too.

555
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,030
So true.

556
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,050
So true.

557
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,970
Oh, this would have been an even better...

558
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,650
Okay, everybody, we're relocating.

559
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,470
We're relocating.

560
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,390
This is an even better hidey hole.

561
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,580
Okay, let me go get my stuff.

562
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,140
Gosh, it's so hard living in the best...

563
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,400
Generated seed ever.

564
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,540
Too many options.

565
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,860
The real estate is going insane.

566
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,420
Location...

567
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,920
Wait, but what about my little...

568
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,440
Okay, this is our garden.

569
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,760
Because we're living the true high fancy life.

570
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,450
Luckily, I don't have much that I own.

571
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,170
Luckily, I'm pretty broke.

572
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,330
All right.

573
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:18,530
Ouch!

574
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,650
Oh gosh, I keep forgetting we need to get food.

575
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,170
And you can't eat any of these fish.

576
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,250
Can't eat that fish.

577
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,170
You can't eat axolotls.

578
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,570
They keep just...

579
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,530
They keep leaving the fish out to taunt me.

580
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,910
They're like, aren't you hungry?

581
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,190
Okay, wow!

582
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,870
This is a home.

583
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,550
Lots of greenery.

584
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,900
Mhm.

585
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,320
What's that saying?

586
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,020
If you have a crafting table, it's a home.

587
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,300
Wow!

588
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,140
It's so gray today.

589
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,180
Fancy people eat...

590
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,800
I don't think you can eat axolotls.

591
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,800
I think they're actually, like, endangered.

592
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,840
Actually, I think they're quite endangered now.

593
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,140
Just like London.

594
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,640
Anybody feeling at home right now?

595
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,620
All right, we really gotta go get food.

596
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,400
We might have to venture out a little bit.

597
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,300
Because I also need to find a way to make a bed.

598
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,280
I don't want to dig if I have no food or anything, but...

599
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,060
Oh gosh!

600
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,940
It's calling to me to go down there.

601
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,860
I'm not gonna lie.

602
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,960
It's pretty tempting.

603
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,640
The British biome.

604
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,180
I know!

605
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,920
How nice of them.

606
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,000
They really wanted...

607
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,440
Anybody in Britain playing this to feel at home.

608
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,520
Nice.

609
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,930
Stop trying to raise Koyu!

610
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,370
She's mine!

611
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,090
Stop trying...

612
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:21,410
No!

613
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,570
Stop it!

614
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,470
In my chat!

615
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,850
I don't know if anybody saw that.

616
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,080
Never stop trying.

617
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,500
Time and place!

618
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,420
Oh gosh, we gotta be really careful, you guys.

619
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,040
Okay, how do I get up?

620
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,440
We'll dig our way up.

621
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,460
This is Minecraft!

622
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,300
Wait, why did I do that?

623
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,500
Dig our way up!

624
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,180
Koyu cute though?

625
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,320
Yeah, Koyu very cute.

626
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,680
No!

627
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,160
Okay, hold on.

628
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,840
I'm trying to get this.

629
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,940
I'm being greedy.

630
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,760
Okay, all right.

631
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:14,960
We're almost out.

632
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:15,860
No, we're not.

633
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,920
I mistook the stone for trees.

634
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,600
Minecraft?

635
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,240
By what?

636
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:25,880
Cruft?

637
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,420
Minecraft.

638
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,620
Use your PTSD for what?

639
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,860
Thank you for the pink joy.

640
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,260
Thank you.

641
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,300
All right.

642
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
Oh, what a lovely day today.

643
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,120
A lovely gray day.

644
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,920
Ouch!

645
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,540
Oh god.

646
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,940
Oh, we need food, you guys.

647
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,340
I'm gonna die.

648
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,640
I'm gonna die for real.

649
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,940
I need precious animals.

650
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,020
I need precious animals around.

651
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,240
Wait, I think I saw...

652
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,120
Nope, that's a flower.

653
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,340
Shoot.

654
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,440
Um, I can't...

655
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,840
I can't die this fast.

656
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,260
It's only been 30 minutes.

657
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,460
I'm starving.

658
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,080
Animals do spawn in here, right?

659
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,080
Mushroom soup?

660
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,140
Oh, mushroom soup.

661
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,540
Wait.

662
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,680
Oh my god, it's a goat.

663
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,080
Can I eat this?

664
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,940
Does that...

665
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,180
Can you eat that one?

666
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,780
It's so empty in here.

667
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,540
I can't run any further.

668
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,780
I can't run anymore.

669
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,720
I'm too slow.

670
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,020
No, please.

671
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,930
Okay, I think we got it.

672
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,270
I'm afraid of the powdered snow.

673
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,930
Gosh, this biome is ginormous.

674
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,910
Guys, if I die from powdered snow, it's really over.

675
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,170
Oh gosh.

676
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,390
I think I see a chicken.

677
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:26,870
Okay.

678
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,810
All right, all right, all right.

679
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,790
Yeah, that's a chicken.

680
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,330
Oh yeah, we got food.

681
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,190
Oh yeah, we got food.

682
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,570
What did I just grab?

683
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,590
Oh, pale oak sapling?

684
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,070
From where?

685
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,050
From homest...

686
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,550
Oh, more chicken.

687
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,450
More chicken, more chicken, more chicken.

688
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,530
Yes.

689
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,470
We'll take their eggs too.

690
00:36:59,210 --> 00:36:59,810
Nice.

691
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,530
The ground.

692
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:04,810
Interesting.

693
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,630
I didn't know you could pick up a...

694
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:09,010
So how do I make a mushroom soup?

695
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,560
How do I make that?

696
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,340
Oyako don time.

697
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:15,960
No.

698
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,560
I only got six here.

699
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,920
I don't think I've ever...

700
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,840
You need a bowl.

701
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:29,900
Oh yeah.

702
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,540
Soup store.

703
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,340
Red and brown mushroom.

704
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,540
I only have red!

705
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,660
All right, I hear more chicken.

706
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,120
Yes.

707
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,300
Nice.

708
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,940
Nice, nice, nice.

709
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,360
Oh, wait.

710
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,540
I saw a brown.

711
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,100
Did I know?

712
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,220
No?

713
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,040
I thought I saw a brown.

714
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,960
Oh wait, there's one all the way over there.

715
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,710
You can hear the...

716
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,890
It sounds different when you walk on the leaves.

717
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,390
Kind of cute.

718
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,470
It's kind of nice.

719
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,650
There it is, there it is, there it is.

720
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:14,430
Pig!

721
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:17,810
Okay, nice.

722
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:18,370
More food.

723
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,970
What we need...

724
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:22,450
Oh, sheep!

725
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,390
Big, big news, big news.

726
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,390
We need the wool.

727
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,170
Oh, I hear a skelly!

728
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,550
They're like right below me.

729
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,330
Oh, I hear them.

730
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,170
This is why I didn't want to...

731
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:42,330
Wait.

732
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,750
I didn't want to go into the...

733
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,810
Into these woods because...

734
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,550
It's kind of spooky.

735
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,040
Okay, I'm leaving.

736
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,900
I'm scared.

737
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,640
Are we gonna make it back in time?

738
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,820
It's starting to get dark.

739
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,140
Guys?

740
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,040
Oh, guys.

741
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,390
I'm scared.

742
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:22,550
I'm scared!

743
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:27,780
Sorry.

744
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:36,990
I'm scared.

745
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,740
Um, we found him!

746
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,920
Can I kill him?

747
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,650
Can I kill him?

748
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,370
Oh my god.

749
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:06,990
Sorry!

750
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,130
Holy mo...

751
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,210
You guys, I'm gonna die here.

752
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,170
I just have to...

753
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:10,870
I can't move.

754
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:11,730
I have to...

755
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,290
I have to just try the axe.

756
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,290
I have no axe!

757
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,710
Uh, would you like a brown mushroom?

758
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,330
Okay, I'm gonna eat some raw chicken.

759
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,410
That was a bad idea.

760
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:29,610
Uh, hmm.

761
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:30,990
Build a wall.

762
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,170
True, true, true.

763
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,320
Hey, hey!

764
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,600
This is mine!

765
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:42,760
Uhum.

766
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:47,610
Now...

767
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,350
Now I'm...

768
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:49,330
...safe.

769
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,450
Can we get up here?

770
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,090
No, it doesn't seem to be the case.

771
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,550
We just gotta keep building up, because I don't want a skelly to knock me off.

772
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:11,730
Okay.

773
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,330
Alright, no skelly is gonna get us up here.

774
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,350
This is so stupid!

775
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,030
No!

776
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,750
Oh, he's gone.

777
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,490
I saw his heart though.

778
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,830
It was like somewhere in this tree, I think.

779
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,720
I wish I had a...

780
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,920
I wish I had a...

781
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,460
What's it called?

782
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,900
An arrow, bow and arrow, so I could like shoot him?

783
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,380
Make food?

784
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,560
I could...

785
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,440
Let's see.

786
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,320
Alright, we gotta make a... Did I get it?

787
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,760
Okay, yeah.

788
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,520
Let's make... Alright, new house everybody!

789
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,100
A furnace?

790
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,420
Alright.

791
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,320
What a beautiful night it is.

792
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,480
Oh, that's a really deep hole.

793
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,540
And there's an Enderman around!

794
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:23,380
Okay.

795
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,420
I'm also gonna make a new axe.

796
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,520
Once I make more wood.

797
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,840
A shield!

798
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:40,820
Ah, so true.

799
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,720
We'll make a shield.

800
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:42,900
That's big.

801
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,700
That's important.

802
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,700
Big importance.

803
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,640
Big importance.

804
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:46,940
Okay.

805
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,080
Don't blink, blink and you're dead.

806
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,060
They're fast, faster than you can believe.

807
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,000
Scary, scary, scary.

808
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,880
Do you think it's in here?

809
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,660
The heart.

810
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,280
We're gonna dig for it.

811
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:02,940
We're gonna see.

812
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:10,110
I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna risk it too much though.

813
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,770
Gosh, these are really thick trees.

814
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:15,570
Please eat.

815
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,210
Bye!

816
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:24,450
I think it was this tree.

817
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:33,190
You can see the flowers are lit up.

818
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,910
Wait, what just...

819
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,550
What just happened?

820
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,760
Oh, my furnace.

821
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:47,980
Furnace.

822
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,400
Alright.

823
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,680
I got one wool.

824
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,340
Let's do some more iron too.

825
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,560
Iron.

826
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,100
Maybe it wasn't this tree.

827
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,560
It's hard to tell though.

828
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,100
I'm gonna keep...

829
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,980
I'm gonna keep digging in here though.

830
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,720
Is that him?

831
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,340
No.

832
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:26,710
Nice shield.

833
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:27,350
Thanks.

834
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:28,350
I got it.

835
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:30,910
Thanks.

836
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:35,150
This is so scary, you guys.

837
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,630
I wasn't prepared for this.

838
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:39,710
What was I thinking?

839
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:44,070
Let's have a relaxing little...

840
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:44,750
Is that Skelly?

841
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,610
Where is that Enderman?

842
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,310
I can hear him.

843
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:50,030
Wait, I see it.

844
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,870
It's right there.

845
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:52,570
It's right there.

846
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,610
You guys see all that...

847
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,670
All that stuff in there.

848
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,790
That's what will make the heart.

849
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,130
That's surrounding the heart.

850
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,830
There's a couple Endies in here.

851
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:16,470
Oh my god.

852
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,140
Wasn't it just such a nice night though?

853
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,300
Right?

854
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,420
Some annoying neighbors.

855
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,160
Truly.

856
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:29,840
OK.

857
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:30,580
Nice.

858
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,420
Let's grab my cobblestone.

859
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,900
Let's grab my stuff.

860
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:37,740
Creeper.

861
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,740
I saw a creeper.

862
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,260
I didn't see anyone.

863
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,810
I hear him, but I don't see him.

864
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:58,470
Let's see.

865
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,890
What else do I have?

866
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,890
Just six...

867
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:03,290
There he is!

868
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:05,110
Hi!

869
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,270
You wish you could get up here.

870
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,550
I don't have enough wool for a bed.

871
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,210
We are kind of stuck at the moment.

872
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,930
We are kind of stuck at the moment.

873
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:31,090
Creeper top right.

874
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:32,510
You guys?

875
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:35,930
Oh my gosh.

876
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:36,930
Creeper real.

877
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:38,590
You were actually right.

878
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:40,270
Wait, there's two of them.

879
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:41,450
There's two creepers down there.

880
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,850
The night is long.

881
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:52,270
It's long.

882
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,570
What's that over there?

883
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:56,710
It's like glinting.

884
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:57,250
You see that?

885
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:01,450
Something shiny all the way over there.

886
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,270
You think it's fire?

887
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,950
We'll go check it out in the morning.

888
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,350
What is that?

889
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:11,430
Fire?

890
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:12,390
Oh, it's getting bigger.

891
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:13,070
A little bit.

892
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,090
Maybe it's a fire from some lava.

893
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,370
Or just lava.

894
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,970
I think that's definitely a fire.

895
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:29,190
Creeper bottom right.

896
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,000
The zombie completely left us alone.

897
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,240
That guy is so lame.

898
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,600
Creeper bottom right of screen.

899
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,180
Wait!

900
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,120
The sun.

901
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,680
The sun is rising!

902
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,700
Wait!

903
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,080
No, I can still see the shiny.

904
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,460
The sun is rising!

905
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,680
Yippee!

906
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,820
We made it!

907
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,160
Being a coward pays.

908
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:10,980
Guys...

909
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,100
If someone says, wow, she's totally...

910
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,300
She's totally cheating.

911
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,400
We lived.

912
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,200
Sunlight!

913
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,240
Alright, when does everything start to burn?

914
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,980
Alright, good night!

915
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,660
Good night!

916
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,300
Good night!

917
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,480
Creaking crumbles.

918
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:45,380
Yeah!

919
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,520
Zombie hurt!

920
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,500
Zombie hurt!

921
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,620
Zombie hurt!

922
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,000
Alright.

923
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,720
We're about good to go down, I think, again.

924
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,000
Things will start to...

925
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,540
Oh yeah, let's get my... I guess I can take this back home.

926
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,780
Doesn't hurt to have an extra, right?

927
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,920
I was just gonna leave it here in case.

928
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:07,960
Oh wait!

929
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,100
Did you guys see that?

930
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,460
I hear skellies.

931
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,580
I hear... Oh my gosh.

932
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,320
There he is.

933
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,080
Alright.

934
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,800
Alright guys, we're gonna take a strategic...

935
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,780
It's not strategic.

936
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:30,720
We're gonna take a beautiful above the tree tour of the area.

937
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:37,340
Have you ever wondered what it's like to live in the trees?

938
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,300
Well, on this tour, I can tell you.

939
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,660
Why didn't I do this before?

940
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,600
Why didn't I just leave like this?

941
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:52,860
I think I messed up.

942
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,200
This is how I could've gotten home.

943
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,620
Alright guys, we do need to leave here though.

944
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:08,040
We found the creaking, we saw him.

945
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,980
He was very, absolutely spooky.

946
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,480
I hear a more eerie noise.

947
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,140
Now look at this house!

948
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,720
Now that's a livable cave.

949
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,620
That's a livable cave.

950
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,560
The fireflies, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe you can only find them in a swamp biome.

951
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,280
Is that true?

952
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,300
Minky the cave diver.

953
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,000
Near rivers too.

954
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:57,980
This

955
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,500
is such a beautiful home.

956
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,600
We got a lot of iron and...

957
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,580
What's it called?

958
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,520
Coal out of it.

959
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,380
Hello, I'm home!

960
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,240
We have a pink axolotl now too!

961
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,120
The family is growing.

962
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,360
We must traverse outside too.

963
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,040
Hold on, I'm going to go grab this coal.

964
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,500
We're going to grab a little bit more supplies from this area.

965
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,180
Welcome home, thank you.

966
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,680
Thank you, thank you.

967
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,820
Alright, anything in here?

968
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,040
Some more supplies, perfect.

969
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,040
Nice, nice.

970
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,880
Nice...

971
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,860
Wow, nice.

972
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:23,420
Nice, nice.

973
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,980
Nice, nice.

974
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,140
Nice.

975
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:30,660
Nice.

976
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,560
Okay, and then there was some coal here.

977
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:38,020
We'll go cook this up, we'll give ourselves some armor.

978
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,740
And we shall be good to go.

979
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:44,800
Gosh, this is such a terrifying place to...

980
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,220
This is such a great and such a terrifying place to start.

981
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,800
What a seed, wow.

982
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,940
I'll have to show you guys the other one that I was looking at.

983
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,960
Because it was also something...

984
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,940
Like, I feel that maybe the Pale Gardens...

985
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:08,180
I know that they spawn by dark oak places, you know?

986
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:12,100
But I feel like maybe they are often by lush caves too.

987
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:16,420
I've only had experience with two of them, and both of them were in this type of area.

988
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,880
Can you share the seed?

989
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,600
I did earlier.

990
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,260
There it is.

991
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

992
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,000
There you go.

993
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,120
Hopefully you had time to grab it.

994
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,200
Hello!

995
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,260
Oh my gosh, so cute.

996
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:40,260
Any study advice on Japanese 1001 first test?

997
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,500
Um...

998
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:55,330
Any... Any... Any advice?

999
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,770
Um...

1000
00:53:58,330 --> 00:53:59,830
Uh...

1001
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:01,070
Uh...

1002
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,570
Uh...

1003
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,390
Uh...

1004
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:10,310
Uh...

1005
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:10,730
Uh...

1006
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,510
Remember...

1007
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,770
Um...

1008
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:15,450
Yabai.

1009
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:18,890
And you'll sound so native.

1010
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,950
Just anything?

1011
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:25,510
Yabai.

1012
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:30,290
It's so funny when I listen to, like...

1013
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,870
Young girls speak in Japanese.

1014
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,210
Like, you know, if I'm shopping or something and I hear the girlies talking.

1015
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,330
The way they talk is so specific.

1016
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,310
And it's always like this.

1017
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:49,270
How do I... I'm just trying to...

1018
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:52,290
Um, today...

1019
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:54,390
Um...

1020
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:55,630
I don't know how to say it.

1021
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:58,650
Maybe...

1022
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,350
Yuta-senpai...

1023
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:04,090
They always...

1024
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:07,810
They always...

1025
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,130
I'm like...

1026
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:14,210
I'm like, how do you get to...

1027
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:18,770
It's like the girls who say like after every... Where is my home?

1028
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:21,490
Who say like after every word.

1029
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,700
So like... I was like...

1030
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,400
Oh my gosh, like...

1031
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,820
It's literally the same thing.

1032
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,260
Just in a different language.

1033
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,780
Japanese valley girl.

1034
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,740
But all the girlies sound like that now.

1035
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:42,420
It's so funny.

1036
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:44,700
Where's my house?

1037
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,280
Oh, there it is.

1038
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,120
Dirt.

1039
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,520
I need to put a...

1040
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,300
My house is not safe anymore.

1041
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,400
Oh no.

1042
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,600
Oh my gosh, 28 pieces.

1043
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,540
We're killing it.

1044
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,620
Japanese zoomers.

1045
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:05,080
Exactly.

1046
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,940
It's hiragana, katakana, grammar and some vocabulary.

1047
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,960
I think for katakana, always be careful of tsu and shi.

1048
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,120
You know?

1049
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,340
They look so similar.

1050
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,840
To the untrained eye.

1051
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,820
Like mint, that's like so funny of you to like say.

1052
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,680
Japan or Florida.

1053
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,840
You know how from Ore ga iru?

1054
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,140
Is a good character.

1055
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,480
What does she do that?

1056
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:43,670
Sushi?

1057
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:46,070
No, tsu and shi.

1058
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,310
Not sushi.

1059
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:50,910
How did I get these saplings?

1060
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,350
I was literally wondering earlier.

1061
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:55,030
I was like, how do you get saplings of these trees?

1062
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,170
Oh, it's so gray.

1063
00:56:58,370 --> 00:56:59,210
Another gray day.

1064
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,910
Alright, well let's go gather some more supplies while that cooks.

1065
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:24,550
Sushi.

1066
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:27,090
No sushi.

1067
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:28,390
I mean, yes sushi.

1068
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,850
Stop, you guys are gonna make me hungry.

1069
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:34,890
You guys are gonna make me hungry.

1070
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:44,730
Where do you think the source is?

1071
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:45,710
Not here.

1072
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,030
Okay, wait, we can get it from here.

1073
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:49,090
Nice.

1074
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:50,750
Nice.

1075
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:52,030
Okay.

1076
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:55,650
Let's go down.

1077
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,500
I'm gonna perform the bucket.

1078
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,100
For my first trick, I will perform the bucket saving life trick.

1079
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,140
How will I get back up?

1080
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,180
Okay, never mind.

1081
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,540
I will perform it another day.

1082
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,220
Okay, here we go.

1083
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,870
Wait, there's more creaking trees down here?

1084
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,830
Oh, that's not good in there.

1085
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:42,750
Oh gosh, we're already this low?

1086
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:45,710
We're already at 15 degrees.

1087
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:05,510
Is the creaking in here too?

1088
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:05,990
Oh, hello.

1089
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:09,790
I'm such a baby.

1090
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,510
Gosh, okay, we gotta get this...

1091
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:17,270
Is it starting to get nighttime or is it just, you know, the area?

1092
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:18,310
I can't tell.

1093
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:19,910
I can't tell.

1094
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:20,790
Okay, nice.

1095
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:21,750
Here we go.

1096
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:23,750
More iron.

1097
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,800
Guys, I think I messed up.

1098
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,610
We're gonna have to wait out the night again.

1099
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:46,630
This sucks.

1100
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:50,430
Look all down there.

1101
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,790
There's so much going on in this little area.

1102
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:58,290
You can make wool from spider string.

1103
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:01,690
Maybe a spider will come and grace us with its presence.

1104
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:05,050
I did think about that, but it's a little...

1105
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:10,930
A little less reliable than just finding some sheep.

1106
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,820
Maybe some spiders will come and...

1107
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:17,550
Grace us.

1108
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:26,710
Well, I don't wanna light up the area then.

1109
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:27,630
I don't want my area...

1110
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:32,130
I don't want this place to explode because of a dang creeper, you know?

1111
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:35,250
What do we do?

1112
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:39,690
I don't have a...

1113
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:42,230
I don't have a bed or a door.

1114
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:42,850
I have nothing.

1115
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:51,170
I only have a little bit of food.

1116
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:55,230
We're not doing so hot, huh, guys?

1117
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:58,210
Okay, one of these will give us a chicken.

1118
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:01,310
One, two...

1119
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:01,970
Dang it.

1120
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:05,850
There's a creeper over there.

1121
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:08,030
Right there.

1122
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:12,530
That's not a spider.

1123
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,630
I don't wanna go into the creaking!

1124
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:20,090
Let's go gambling?

1125
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,560
Okay, nothing can get in here, right?

1126
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,680
Alright, time to dig.

1127
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,740
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel.

1128
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,080
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel.

1129
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,320
I hear axolotls.

1130
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,280
Maybe not this way.

1131
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,160
Okay, we're gonna change direction.

1132
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:48,460
This way.

1133
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:02,110
Okay.

1134
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:04,370
Alright.

1135
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:10,090
You guys, some of you guys will be like foaming at the mouth for this seed.

1136
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,110
You'll be like, oh my gosh, this is the best seed ever.

1137
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:16,150
Here I am, fighting for my life.

1138
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,150
Oh.

1139
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:30,390
It's like the luckiest seed.

1140
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:35,370
I just can't believe that we got to the area first try.

1141
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:38,450
My afterlife?

1142
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:43,570
Well, it's technically my life in Minecraft, so...

1143
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:47,950
You're trying to um actually my terminology?

1144
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:55,030
You're just like, uh, Minto is actually your afterlife.

1145
01:02:58,590 --> 01:02:59,870
Nemi Nightmare!

1146
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,310
Thank you for the raid!

1147
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:05,690
Raining?

1148
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:10,570
Nemi, have you ever... Oh my gosh.

1149
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:12,970
Whoa, this rain is coming down hard.

1150
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,530
Have you ever seen a creaking Nemi?

1151
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:18,270
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

1152
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:19,530
Murphy.

1153
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:22,730
Have you ever seen a creaking?

1154
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:24,310
Guys, should we go show her?

1155
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,270
Let me make some more armor.

1156
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:32,930
What a creaking.

1157
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,880
Let me make my armor and then I'll show you.

1158
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,020
I'll be brave.

1159
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:44,920
I will be brave!

1160
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,280
Um, we got our shield.

1161
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,500
We got our sword.

1162
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:55,960
Off we go.

1163
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,240
Okay.

1164
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:01,540
Cabo, thank you for the tag.

1165
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:03,360
Okay.

1166
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,020
Wait, the flowers are bloomed!

1167
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:07,600
Awesome.

1168
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:11,460
Alright, let's find a way to the creaking.

1169
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:13,820
First I must...

1170
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:15,860
But hello!

1171
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,300
I hope you had a good stream!

1172
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:19,680
Hello, Naplings.

1173
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:20,520
Welcome.

1174
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,040
I'm... I'm... Okay.

1175
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:24,820
You know what?

1176
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:25,680
I'm just gonna build up.

1177
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,480
We could die here.

1178
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,060
We could die here.

1179
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:33,840
That's our risk to take.

1180
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:41,200
Snow in there.

1181
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,380
Okay, we're in.

1182
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:42,780
We're in.

1183
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,120
We're in.

1184
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:48,970
We're in.

1185
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:51,970
Creaking!

1186
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:54,790
Creaking!

1187
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:56,650
Does it not rain in here?

1188
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:57,710
It's so scary.

1189
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:00,570
That's a skelly.

1190
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:01,370
Ouch!

1191
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:03,330
Stop!

1192
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:05,550
Stop it.

1193
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:06,530
Stop it.

1194
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:07,030
It's not cute.

1195
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:08,410
Stop it.

1196
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:09,030
Ouch.

1197
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,790
Stop.

1198
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:10,890
It's not cute.

1199
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,250
We're destroying the environment.

1200
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:19,370
That's okay though.

1201
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:21,730
It's just a spider.

1202
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:23,830
We gotta find a creaking.

1203
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,390
Alright, take its wool.

1204
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:31,530
We're fine.

1205
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,360
I'm stuck in a hole.

1206
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,120
We're looking for a creaking.

1207
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,020
Wait, I think I heard one.

1208
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:43,540
Why does it gotta be extra spooky with the rain?

1209
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,140
I can't see anything.

1210
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:48,360
Eat?

1211
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,320
Oh yeah, thank you.

1212
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:53,820
That's all our food.

1213
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,100
That's all we got left.

1214
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:55,600
Wait, hold on.

1215
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,080
That's all we got left, everybody.

1216
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,400
I was gonna make a torch.

1217
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,300
Nevermind, I can't.

1218
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,280
Let's go find a creaking.

1219
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:16,100
Look how beautiful though.

1220
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:17,900
Creaking!

1221
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,740
Is it really this hard to find one?

1222
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:24,940
Maybe we should go back to where we found before.

1223
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,460
Low HP run.

1224
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:32,650
Let's let go.

1225
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:37,890
Creaking!

1226
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:39,390
I'm scared.

1227
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,310
I thought I saw one over there.

1228
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:44,370
I'm scared.

1229
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:47,590
It was over this way, I know.

1230
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:48,150
I remember.

1231
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:51,030
Oh my gosh, baby zombie.

1232
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:56,550
Leave me alone!

1233
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:57,410
Leave me alone!

1234
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:01,730
I forget everything is stronger in hardcore mode.

1235
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:03,510
Another Zombo.

1236
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:05,670
Another Zombo.

1237
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:08,290
Creaking, don't go!

1238
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:11,670
Hello Enderman.

1239
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:14,230
Another Zombo.

1240
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:19,950
Another Zombo?

1241
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:20,450
Where?

1242
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:24,650
Oh my gosh.

1243
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,820
Oh my god, guys?

1244
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:30,880
Sayonara!

1245
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:31,880
Guys!

1246
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:32,560
No!

1247
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:34,180
Creaking!

1248
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:35,340
That's the creaking!

1249
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:36,440
There's two of them!

1250
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,680
There's two... I'm so dead.

1251
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:38,340
I'm so dead.

1252
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:38,960
I'm so dead.

1253
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:39,580
I'm so dead.

1254
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:40,260
I'm so dead.

1255
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:41,420
Sayonara, everybody.

1256
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:42,580
It was a nice life.

1257
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,120
Dug up soda!

1258
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,100
And the sun was coming!

1259
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:22,480
How big is this area anyway?

1260
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,520
My goodness.

1261
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,580
Oh my gosh, it was a nice life.

1262
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:27,160
Was it?

1263
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,160
Nice as...

1264
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:30,780
Look at this.

1265
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,260
This spawn is so crazy though.

1266
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,420
Wow, we should've just gone in here.

1267
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,480
It would've been so beautiful.

1268
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,220
What the?

1269
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,140
Oh yes, this is...

1270
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:46,480
Yeah, this is where the... I was gonna say there's a tree all the way in here.

1271
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,100
Yeah, this is the tree.

1272
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,300
Respectable attempt.

1273
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,480
Gosh, I really tried to...

1274
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:55,380
To build up.

1275
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,420
Only too late.

1276
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:02,120
The tree, the tree got me.

1277
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,640
Oh, that's right.

1278
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:07,040
We can't fly too far.

1279
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,440
Oh no.

1280
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:09,420
Wait.

1281
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:10,880
Oh, it's loading in slowly.

1282
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:12,940
No, load!

1283
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:13,740
We were here!

1284
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,200
My first home, I promise.

1285
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,080
Misadventure from trying to show off to a girl.

1286
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,360
I was able to show the creaking.

1287
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,740
There was two of them, they were coming after me.

1288
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:31,960
This seed is so... Wait.

1289
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:39,120
I don't know if I've ever... I've never put in a... Like a...

1290
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:42,500
A biome...

1291
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:50,380
You guys, if we had dug far enough...

1292
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,440
If we had dug far enough, we would...

1293
01:09:54,940 --> 01:10:01,260
If we had dug far enough, we would've been in even more trouble.

1294
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:07,040
We would've been in the biggest trouble.

1295
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,320
How does this always happen to me?

1296
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,800
How does this always happen to me?

1297
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:21,360
Oh my goodness.

1298
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:28,280
But yeah, I kind of want to go back into this world, but like fly around a little bit.

1299
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,620
I just want to see... You know, since it doesn't load all the way.

1300
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,900
This is so... I love when the...

1301
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,700
The mossy biome grows into a mine shaft.

1302
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,500
So pretty.

1303
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,220
So pretty.

1304
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,320
Yeah, I tried showing off to a girl.

1305
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:54,700
Yeah, and what?

1306
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,840
Yeah, I tried...

1307
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:01,000
I still got the mission accomplished.

1308
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:03,700
I found the creaking.

1309
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:04,840
He was coming after me.

1310
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:06,960
Maybe.

1311
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:10,100
Hold on.

1312
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:10,940
What was the scene?

1313
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:13,260
Okay.

1314
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,860
Can I... Can I copy this?

1315
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,420
Click to copy.

1316
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:20,340
Paste.

1317
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:24,840
I'll paste it in chat for you guys too, in case anybody wants to...

1318
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,700
Wants to see also.

1319
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,040
Hold on.

1320
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:30,320
Now we save and quit.

1321
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:31,340
If I...

1322
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:32,200
Single player.

1323
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,360
Create new world.

1324
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:35,800
World.

1325
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,580
Seed.

1326
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:40,900
Create.

1327
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:45,560
So let's just do... Create a new world.

1328
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:54,750
I just want to see the size of the...

1329
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:56,390
The biome.

1330
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:57,410
You know?

1331
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:00,530
Cause it's... I think this is like...

1332
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:04,270
It's so expansive.

1333
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:06,270
And this is where we were.

1334
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:10,370
And this is where I died.

1335
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:12,950
Like right over here.

1336
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:17,470
Yeah, I was like right about here when I died.

1337
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:19,970
Oh my god.

1338
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:24,510
That's so much.

1339
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:27,330
Look, it continues all the way over here.

1340
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,280
All the way over here.

1341
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:40,780
But we must try again, because we... This time for sure we'll go find the...

1342
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:41,720
Fireflies.

1343
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,250
This time for sure.

1344
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:51,130
Oh, it was a lava pit.

1345
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:57,190
Wow, there's more on the other side.

1346
01:12:58,630 --> 01:12:59,970
All the mushrooms.

1347
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:06,370
What an insane spawn point.

1348
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:07,990
Good.

1349
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:16,980
Next world.

1350
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,900
Shall we travel to the next adventure?

1351
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,760
As much as I want.

1352
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:23,680
I love... Look at these.

1353
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:25,940
Look at the flowers on the ground.

1354
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:28,740
It's too cute.

1355
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,000
It's so cute.

1356
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,460
I hope they do the same, but with a...

1357
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:34,880
Hold on, I'll show you guys something.

1358
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,480
With the leaf litter.

1359
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,400
Look at this.

1360
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,380
I wonder actually if there's a good way to show this off.

1361
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,480
Hold on.

1362
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,170
Oh yeah, you can see it here.

1363
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:50,230
Look at the gradient.

1364
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:55,450
It like... It goes like more monochrome.

1365
01:13:58,950 --> 01:13:59,990
And then...

1366
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:04,510
It goes from monochrome and then it goes into the brown.

1367
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:04,690
Hold on.

1368
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:08,230
Isn't that so cool?

1369
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:14,760
Depending on the biome.

1370
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,400
Isn't that so neat?

1371
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,440
The gray to the brown to the brown.

1372
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,370
I like the leaf litter a lot.

1373
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:26,110
I think it's so pretty.

1374
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:28,890
Oh, whoops.

1375
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:30,670
You can really see it here though.

1376
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:37,290
Here, let's do... Let's do... Yeah, you can see it.

1377
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:39,850
Actually, let's do...

1378
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:41,490
Like that.

1379
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:42,090
There we go.

1380
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:45,790
There you go.

1381
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:47,650
Science.

1382
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:52,230
Alright.

1383
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:54,490
Create new world.

1384
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:56,790
Newest.

1385
01:14:57,490 --> 01:15:01,230
This is Firefly...

1386
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,250
World.

1387
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:05,030
I can't type today.

1388
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:07,030
Hardcore.

1389
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:09,890
On experiments.

1390
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:11,390
On experiments.

1391
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:15,150
The real world.

1392
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:27,160
We have found the fireflies.

1393
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,020
We have found...

1394
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:39,340
Why does this keep happening to me?

1395
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,580
We have Minecraft music.

1396
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:54,990
OK, we'll take these for later.

1397
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:56,950
Maybe there are some other ones.

1398
01:15:57,890 --> 01:15:58,350
Or something.

1399
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:02,650
Where...Minecraft, where is your sense of adventure?

1400
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:14,360
Kiwawa!

1401
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,780
Wait, where is the Wawa?

1402
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:20,180
Hi Kiwawa, I miss you.

1403
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:21,880
Wait, WTF.

1404
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:29,940
Kiwawa, I saw that you also were looking for the creaking in your new holo server.

1405
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,180
My last game literally spawned right in the bio.

1406
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,420
Right in it.

1407
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,360
I didn't have to do anything.

1408
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,340
But I want to do something.

1409
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,980
I want to search and explore.

1410
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:56,400
I want to be an explorer.

1411
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,400
I want there to be stakes.

1412
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:04,220
High stakes.

1413
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:06,940
Hacker girl.

1414
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:07,980
I'm not.

1415
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,120
I'm not.

1416
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,340
The music disappeared.

1417
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,000
I'm just gaming I suppose.

1418
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:20,660
There is more of them.

1419
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:26,930
I guess maybe these are easier to find.

1420
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:30,710
I mean before we were in the mountains so...

1421
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:32,570
Oh my gosh!

1422
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:37,150
Do you see what I see?

1423
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:40,810
Fuzzy cow!

1424
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:42,630
Look how cute.

1425
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:44,530
How am I supposed to kill this for food?

1426
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:49,630
How am I supposed to kill this guy for food?

1427
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:51,210
He is so fuzzy and cute.

1428
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:52,530
Oh my gosh.

1429
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:56,110
He is so cute.

1430
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:58,330
Amazing.

1431
01:17:58,430 --> 01:17:59,050
Mission complete.

1432
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:00,870
That right there is why he is the best boss.

1433
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:04,370
No violence.

1434
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:09,970
Let's see.

1435
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:16,790
Let's start making some...

1436
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:19,010
Sticks and stuff.

1437
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,070
I don't know.

1438
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:27,460
I don't know.

1439
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,140
Stop trying to risk people in my chat.

1440
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,860
Master Gandalf.

1441
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,280
Goodbye.

1442
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:38,660
Goodbye.

1443
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,360
You said you wanted some high stakes.

1444
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,460
Are the chickens here also cute?

1445
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,080
Let's see.

1446
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,380
Let's find some chickens.

1447
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,880
Oh my gosh.

1448
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,900
I'm gonna have to kill this cow for food.

1449
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:00,280
Sorry.

1450
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:01,020
Sorry.

1451
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:01,680
Sorry.

1452
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,380
I know you are so cute and fuzzy.

1453
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:05,720
I'm really sorry.

1454
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:08,500
Dog!

1455
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,780
Wait, I heard a chicken.

1456
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:12,900
Chicken?

1457
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:16,140
Oh my god!

1458
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:17,880
Look at him!

1459
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:20,960
Look at that guy.

1460
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,520
No rizzing allowed in chat.

1461
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,160
Not in front of my salad.

1462
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:28,960
Oh my god!

1463
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:30,080
There is another one over here.

1464
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,960
Wait, they added... That's right too.

1465
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,820
They added the dog personalities.

1466
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:39,000
Like the dogs have different barks where they go.

1467
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,540
They have different barks and stuff now too.

1468
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:43,660
Hello dog.

1469
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:45,220
Dog?

1470
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,100
Okay.

1471
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:52,740
It's feisty.

1472
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:00,020
I need to test different kinds of cinnamon.

1473
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,340
Anything you recommend I bake.

1474
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:02,940
Oh my gosh.

1475
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:09,520
I don't know why my first instinct was to tell you to do the cinnamon challenge.

1476
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:13,580
You know where you take the cinnamon and you put it in your mouth on a spoon?

1477
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,180
You could do that.

1478
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:22,570
We gotta go find some coal.

1479
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:28,370
Chat, get pregnant.

1480
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:29,050
Stop!

1481
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:33,170
What are you trying to take over?

1482
01:20:33,290 --> 01:20:33,870
Oh, nice.

1483
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:37,130
Trying to take over the stream.

1484
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:39,630
It's not your place.

1485
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:42,910
Yeah.

1486
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:44,650
Yes?

1487
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:46,110
Oh, good.

1488
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:46,910
Okay, nice.

1489
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,230
Oh, nice.

1490
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:52,750
Oh, nice!

1491
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:56,530
Yay, hole.

1492
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:04,640
Chat, I will always advocate for you guys to use protection.

1493
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:04,700
Protection.

1494
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:08,840
Every time.

1495
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,220
Protect yourself.

1496
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,080
The world is scary.

1497
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,340
Like helmets?

1498
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:22,280
Yeah, exactly.

1499
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,380
You don't want to get into an accident.

1500
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,980
That involves another human being.

1501
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:35,220
If you get into an accident...

1502
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:39,140
You know, it should be from your own...

1503
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:42,220
Your own...

1504
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,240
Stupid self.

1505
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:48,790
Oh, yeah.

1506
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,130
Some more chicken.

1507
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:52,050
Oh, yeah.

1508
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:53,510
This chicken better taste different.

1509
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:57,690
This chicken has better insulated feathers.

1510
01:21:58,530 --> 01:21:59,970
So it's gonna taste good.

1511
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:00,870
Nice and juicy.

1512
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:03,050
Nice and juicy.

1513
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:10,550
Get out of here.

1514
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:13,270
Any iron?

1515
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:14,550
Iron.

1516
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:22,250
You guys, you wanna know one of my favorite things about Takanashi Kiara.

1517
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:23,190
Hopefully she's gone.

1518
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:26,550
But I love the way she says Bayomi.

1519
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:26,650
Bayomi.

1520
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:30,230
Iron.

1521
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:33,710
She says, we gotta go find that Bayomi.

1522
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:37,870
It's so cute.

1523
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:41,430
Are there Chihuahua dogs?

1524
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:43,390
I don't think so.

1525
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:45,290
I hear lava too.

1526
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,310
Lava is somewhere.

1527
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:50,790
Maybe underneath us.

1528
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:53,910
It's the better pronunciation.

1529
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:54,570
I agree.

1530
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:57,870
Can I ask when you'll give us wave 3?

1531
01:22:58,810 --> 01:22:59,570
In patience.

1532
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:01,870
In due time.

1533
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:05,310
Wave 3 will happen.

1534
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,960
Actually, I was hoping it would happen sooner.

1535
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:20,700
But...

1536
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,460
There have been some delays.

1537
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:27,860
Alright, we gotta... Okay, I'm gonna go get that coal.

1538
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,540
And then we're gonna...

1539
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,360
What do I do now, you guys?

1540
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:34,120
I have no purpose.

1541
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:40,050
I have no purpose now.

1542
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:46,030
Everything that I wanted to do in this stream has been completed literally as soon as I logged in.

1543
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:50,230
Try to find fossils?

1544
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:50,630
What?

1545
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:51,650
This is a wrong game.

1546
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:54,390
I think you don't... I don't think you know what...

1547
01:23:58,370 --> 01:23:58,830
Desert.

1548
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:00,790
Okay, true.

1549
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:01,950
True, true, true.

1550
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:04,230
They added also some stuff to the desert.

1551
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:06,610
Like, some ambiance.

1552
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,970
And...

1553
01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:10,910
And other things.

1554
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:13,750
We'll find a desert!

1555
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,000
Is there copium in the desert?

1556
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:27,940
I don't cope ever.

1557
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,600
Finding fossils is no biggie.

1558
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:32,920
Wait.

1559
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:35,960
There's actually fossils?

1560
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:36,120
Fossils?

1561
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,560
Fossils have been a thing in Minecraft for years... Wait, what?

1562
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,740
There's fossils in the game?

1563
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:50,790
Yeah?

1564
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:54,430
Wait, what?

1565
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:56,690
I've never... What do you mean?

1566
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:58,610
For years though.

1567
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:04,770
There are bone block structures you can find underground.

1568
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:04,790
Underground?

1569
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:11,150
I've never found one.

1570
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:11,950
Ever.

1571
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:15,250
That's real?

1572
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:16,930
It's starting to get dark.

1573
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:18,750
I found one the other day.

1574
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:20,770
What?

1575
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:22,370
I've never found one ever.

1576
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:25,090
Let's build a small home up here.

1577
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:38,360
And by home, I mean we're going mining.

1578
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,200
Heck yeah.

1579
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:42,860
More coal.

1580
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,490
In fact...

1581
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:48,200
Torch?

1582
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,780
Torch this place up?

1583
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,620
Why can't I make a torch?

1584
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:57,740
Why can't I make a torch?

1585
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:11,370
You need coal?

1586
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:12,130
You guys.

1587
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:14,290
I have 40 coal!

1588
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:16,770
And I have sticks right here!

1589
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:18,950
Stick and coal.

1590
01:26:21,070 --> 01:26:23,170
Why wasn't it showing up in my inventory?

1591
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:24,070
Oh gosh.

1592
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,490
That's strange.

1593
01:26:32,610 --> 01:26:37,910
Or like, not inventory, but in my recipes is what I meant to say.

1594
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:41,350
Money!

1595
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:42,970
More food.

1596
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:44,570
Come back.

1597
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:45,750
Come back dinner.

1598
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:47,050
And dinner too.

1599
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:52,320
What are those?

1600
01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:57,730
Uh oh, things are starting to appear.

1601
01:26:58,770 --> 01:26:59,610
What is that?

1602
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:02,570
I thought it was a pillager at first.

1603
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:05,630
We're probably safe over here.

1604
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:07,490
Dinner and supper.

1605
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:12,990
They won't come all the way over here.

1606
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:14,730
Right?

1607
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:18,070
We're probably fine.

1608
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:25,110
I'm making a stone sword.

1609
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:28,210
And I'm making a...

1610
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:31,990
Good thing I made a stone sword.

1611
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:35,750
Yeah, that's right.

1612
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:37,190
He gave me iron!

1613
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:39,290
Lucky guy.

1614
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:41,730
Alright, we're making a furnace.

1615
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,040
For a chicken.

1616
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:54,460
Phew.

1617
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:56,880
Can I make a shield?

1618
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:58,240
I think it's two, right?

1619
01:27:58,340 --> 01:27:58,680
Oh no!

1620
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,280
I need more wood.

1621
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:01,540
Alright, we'll make a shield.

1622
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:03,140
Eventually.

1623
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:07,640
Oh,

1624
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:11,980
whoops.

1625
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,120
I just realized that.

1626
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:18,830
I'm looking around.

1627
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:19,670
I'm searching the premises.

1628
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:22,810
So far...

1629
01:28:22,810 --> 01:28:23,790
Not so bad.

1630
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:25,310
More iron.

1631
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:29,990
Back in my day, we didn't have the recipe book.

1632
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:32,830
Okay.

1633
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:34,650
Okay, grandpa.

1634
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:38,810
Back in my day, kids just learned.

1635
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:40,250
You

1636
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,640
guys, I didn't get the shi...

1637
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:56,960
Oh, my precious...

1638
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,500
What is this?

1639
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,000
These piggies look so silly!

1640
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:02,840
They look diseased, actually.

1641
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:05,520
Wait, I didn't get to show you!

1642
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:09,860
I didn't get to show you the fireflies!

1643
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,880
I didn't get to show you.

1644
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:20,340
I didn't get to... They were right here where we spawned!

1645
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,140
Maybe Cortex is a five gifted.

1646
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:30,580
We didn't explore at all.

1647
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,700
I got creeper on manned!

1648
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,100
Oh, man.

1649
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:40,930
No!

1650
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:45,890
Oh, man.

1651
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:47,970
Oh, man!

1652
01:29:50,410 --> 01:29:52,870
Yeah, next spawn will be a desert for sure!

1653
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:56,990
Desert world!

1654
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:01,070
You guys, this is real.

1655
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:03,030
This is actual manifesting.

1656
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:05,350
This is actual real manifestation.

1657
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,870
Here we go!

1658
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:08,990
I'm closing my eyes!

1659
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:11,750
3, 2, 1!

1660
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:36,630
I...

1661
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:48,010
I don't...

1662
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:52,450
I don't understand.

1663
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:08,660
I don't understand.

1664
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:10,440
I don't understand.

1665
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,280
How 3 for 3?

1666
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:16,860
How this is possible?

1667
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:20,400
What is that over here?

1668
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,740
Is this an ocelot?

1669
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:29,050
It's a panda!

1670
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:31,870
Oh my gosh!

1671
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:35,230
I don't understand.

1672
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:38,910
Is it actually the name?

1673
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:40,530
That can't be true.

1674
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,520
I need to try something.

1675
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:52,440
I need to...

1676
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,900
Think of another biome!

1677
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:58,800
Wait, swamp!

1678
01:32:59,280 --> 01:32:59,940
Swamp?

1679
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:01,900
Swamp?

1680
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:04,920
I don't know!

1681
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:09,280
Can I spawn a world called my dad came back from getting milk?

1682
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,960
I can't believe it!

1683
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,160
I'm still... I'm still shooketh.

1684
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:16,920
I'm not gonna make a new world.

1685
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:17,920
I don't wanna...

1686
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,840
This is my... I don't...

1687
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:22,480
My luck will surely run out.

1688
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:26,960
I can't even punch trees.

1689
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:27,820
I can't do anything.

1690
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:31,280
I'm too... I'm too stunned to speak.

1691
01:33:39,770 --> 01:33:41,050
You want the seed?

1692
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:44,670
Just like... Oh no!

1693
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:46,670
The world's on fire!

1694
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:50,070
That's the way I'm gonna... I'm gonna be born.

1695
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:51,110
I know!

1696
01:33:51,530 --> 01:33:52,430
You're a rockstar!

1697
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:55,790
I'm too...

1698
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:56,850
Oh, there we go.

1699
01:33:56,890 --> 01:33:57,050
Ok.

1700
01:33:58,470 --> 01:34:00,130
I'm too stunned to speak!

1701
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:03,430
Oh my gosh.

1702
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:04,050
Oh, the seed.

1703
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:08,870
There you go.

1704
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:12,290
Jump?

1705
01:34:12,590 --> 01:34:12,870
Ok!

1706
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:17,210
Ok.

1707
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:23,210
Cute!

1708
01:34:26,450 --> 01:34:29,310
I feel like I should have made some torches.

1709
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:34,690
Oh gosh.

1710
01:34:35,070 --> 01:34:35,410
Oh gosh.

1711
01:34:35,630 --> 01:34:36,090
I'm gonna die.

1712
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:37,510
Tiny zombie.

1713
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:38,950
I'm gonna die by tiny zombie.

1714
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:40,350
I'm gonna die by tiny zombie.

1715
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:42,130
I'm gonna die by tiny zombie.

1716
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:47,530
We made it.

1717
01:34:48,970 --> 01:34:49,870
Sweep!

1718
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:52,690
Where is that guy?

1719
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:57,650
Stupid tiny zombie.

1720
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,200
Oh my gosh.

1721
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,740
Manifestation is real.

1722
01:35:11,310 --> 01:35:12,950
Hot dog.

1723
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:15,150
Hot dog.

1724
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:22,920
This is the universe's way of making it up to you for the Ender Dragon collab with Doki.

1725
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:25,720
But this is the one time I wanted to explore!

1726
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:31,080
This is the one time I was like, ok guys...

1727
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:33,000
We're gonna explore.

1728
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:34,240
It's gonna be whatever.

1729
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,160
It's gonna be just chill exploration.

1730
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:41,340
It doesn't matter.

1731
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,600
There's no end goal except finding the things.

1732
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:48,300
Maybe we'll find a village at least so I can get some food.

1733
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:58,260
Let's go try and find a village I guess.

1734
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:05,030
I have literally nothing.

1735
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:06,750
I'm too... wait!

1736
01:36:08,530 --> 01:36:10,990
I think I see a well at least.

1737
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:11,870
Let's see.

1738
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:13,970
Maybe there's a village over here.

1739
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:19,710
Why not try creative?

1740
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:22,810
Because I wanted to explore and find the biomes.

1741
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:28,950
I wanted to explore and find them, but...

1742
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:34,850
We're here I guess.

1743
01:36:35,610 --> 01:36:38,050
Wow, the... what's it called?

1744
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:41,190
The lush biome is really huge here.

1745
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:47,690
Yeah, Camel is desert only.

1746
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:52,560
Dang it.

1747
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:57,200
I was hoping it was the top of an actual...

1748
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,420
house.

1749
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:03,320
The windy sounds kind of sound like a...

1750
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:05,300
like a creeper coming up.

1751
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:12,910
I have no brush.

1752
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:17,310
I have no food.

1753
01:37:18,450 --> 01:37:21,090
I have... I have no words.

1754
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:24,250
I have nothing.

1755
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:26,070
Oh here, maybe we can get some food.

1756
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:29,690
Come here.

1757
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:30,830
Come here, bunny.

1758
01:37:31,050 --> 01:37:31,390
I'm sorry.

1759
01:37:31,570 --> 01:37:31,890
I'm sorry.

1760
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:32,590
I'm sorry.

1761
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:33,290
Thank you.

1762
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:39,580
You... you didn't say anything.

1763
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:42,480
Everything's fine.

1764
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:45,860
Come here.

1765
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,420
You're my only hope!

1766
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:49,340
Obi-Wan!

1767
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:51,940
Thank you.

1768
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:56,440
What do you mean no guys?

1769
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,360
I can't... I have no other option.

1770
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,880
Unless you want me to never run again.

1771
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:11,030
Alright.

1772
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:14,490
Gosh, why is Minecraft have to be so realistic?

1773
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:18,070
You need food for...

1774
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:20,510
for doing things.

1775
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:22,570
So lame, this baby.

1776
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:24,090
Babies give nothing.

1777
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:27,050
Come here.

1778
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:27,470
Come here.

1779
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:28,510
Come here.

1780
01:38:30,170 --> 01:38:31,870
Got a lucky foot.

1781
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:36,850
Let's see if we can find a village.

1782
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:38,990
And I'll go punch these trees.

1783
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:44,590
At least we have these trees to punch, I suppose.

1784
01:38:45,230 --> 01:38:46,050
Oh, I hear a spider.

1785
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:48,610
Maybe there's a... what's it called?

1786
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:50,050
Underneath the...

1787
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:56,120
Probably a...

1788
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,280
Not a cave.

1789
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:58,800
Mineshaft.

1790
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:04,390
Dinogon!

1791
01:39:04,630 --> 01:39:05,110
Welcome to membership.

1792
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:05,870
Thank you.

1793
01:39:07,570 --> 01:39:09,350
You really needed a lucky foot.

1794
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:10,690
Is streamer luck real?

1795
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:15,390
Okay, I'm finally playing the game again.

1796
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:17,470
I'm finally done being stunlocked.

1797
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:21,450
I'm playing the game.

1798
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:23,910
I'm punching trees.

1799
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:26,090
I'm done being stunlocked.

1800
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:32,010
I love the little leaves.

1801
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:34,810
The dropping leaves that they added.

1802
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:35,870
It's so cute.

1803
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:41,610
Okay, what else can we find around here?

1804
01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:43,810
And the flowers that they added to the cactus?

1805
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:45,590
Also very cute.

1806
01:39:46,410 --> 01:39:47,450
Big fan, big fan.

1807
01:39:47,530 --> 01:39:49,390
Wow, the lush biome is huge.

1808
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:51,430
Look at all these azaleas.

1809
01:39:53,330 --> 01:39:54,710
There's a cave biome below you.

1810
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:55,250
I know.

1811
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:57,550
Turtle!

1812
01:39:57,710 --> 01:39:58,250
Welcome to membership!

1813
01:39:59,630 --> 01:40:00,650
Aventurine, welcome to membership!

1814
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:01,990
Thank you guys.

1815
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:07,490
Is this a new Minecraft song?

1816
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:09,790
No, it's my own original song.

1817
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:11,110
Actually.

1818
01:40:12,370 --> 01:40:15,490
It's my own original BGM, if you like it.

1819
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:19,590
You can listen to it anytime... Oh gosh, it's starting to get dark.

1820
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:23,510
Village?

1821
01:40:26,470 --> 01:40:28,410
Come here, bunny.

1822
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:29,450
Come here, bunny.

1823
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:34,610
Me too.

1824
01:40:37,190 --> 01:40:37,870
Sorry.

1825
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:45,590
I was hoping we'd find...

1826
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:49,490
I feel like you get so much better luck with spawning...

1827
01:40:49,490 --> 01:40:51,610
When you're running kind of close-ish to a...

1828
01:40:51,610 --> 01:40:56,530
To a village over all three things that we...

1829
01:40:56,530 --> 01:41:00,490
Well, I guess the firefly one isn't so difficult, but...

1830
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:10,130
Alright, we are...

1831
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:10,790
So dead.

1832
01:41:13,230 --> 01:41:14,310
I'll just keep running.

1833
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:16,210
I'll just run and I won't stop running.

1834
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:20,250
Oh wow, that's like the smallest ruined portal I've ever seen.

1835
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:22,690
There's literally nothing here.

1836
01:41:24,130 --> 01:41:25,750
Maybe there's some stuff though.

1837
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:29,050
Oh, they're all below me.

1838
01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:30,410
A lodestone.

1839
01:41:31,370 --> 01:41:32,370
We got some food.

1840
01:41:32,770 --> 01:41:33,910
We got some stuff.

1841
01:41:35,730 --> 01:41:36,730
I'll take the armor.

1842
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:37,350
I'll take everything.

1843
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:38,190
I'll take the clock.

1844
01:41:38,910 --> 01:41:39,830
That's good, actually.

1845
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:45,470
Let's rearrange some things a little bit.

1846
01:41:48,590 --> 01:41:51,550
Whatever is below me is so close below me.

1847
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:56,250
Like I can hear everything creeping and crawling around.

1848
01:41:56,990 --> 01:41:57,550
Alright.

1849
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:04,960
I'm not gonna waste my sword on... Okay, let's just keep running.

1850
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:11,480
Wait, can you not eat the melon slice?

1851
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:12,840
Oh my God.

1852
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:15,660
You can't eat the melon?

1853
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:18,180
Just kidding, we're so dead.

1854
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,520
They're for potions.

1855
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:23,900
We're so dead.

1856
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:45,830
It's got metal in it.

1857
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:47,250
Never stopped me before.

1858
01:42:48,210 --> 01:42:49,170
What can I say?

1859
01:42:49,210 --> 01:42:49,750
I'm a ghost.

1860
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:52,230
Ah, let's see.

1861
01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:00,810
Isn't life just so funny?

1862
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:05,230
You know, we get some of the luckiest...

1863
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:07,250
Some of the...

1864
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:09,230
Some of the luckiest...

1865
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:13,710
Spawns.

1866
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:14,910
And yet, here I am.

1867
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:17,230
Just...

1868
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:19,890
You're cracking up?

1869
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:22,150
I'm really looking forward to cracking up.

1870
01:43:22,550 --> 01:43:24,090
I haven't cracked up in a while.

1871
01:43:24,710 --> 01:43:26,310
I was really looking forward to cracking up.

1872
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:31,450
Can you stop being creepy at my feet, please?

1873
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:39,820
I don't have enough food to, like, book it, you know?

1874
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:43,280
Better hope a spider doesn't spot you.

1875
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:44,440
Oh, it won't.

1876
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:48,460
That would be, like, too unlucky, you know?

1877
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,840
We can always build up.

1878
01:43:59,170 --> 01:44:00,370
There's always up.

1879
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:01,410
Watch.

1880
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:02,710
Right over there.

1881
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:03,830
I predict.

1882
01:44:04,450 --> 01:44:05,690
Right over there.

1883
01:44:06,530 --> 01:44:08,410
Right on the other side of that hill.

1884
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:10,310
Is a village.

1885
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:12,670
I bet on it.

1886
01:44:12,790 --> 01:44:14,070
I bet on it.

1887
01:44:14,650 --> 01:44:15,630
Bet on it.

1888
01:44:15,670 --> 01:44:16,430
Bet on it.

1889
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:17,210
I bet you.

1890
01:44:19,930 --> 01:44:20,950
What should we bet?

1891
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:21,690
What should we bet?

1892
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:26,660
What are we betting?

1893
01:44:36,530 --> 01:44:38,070
Look, it's already halfway through the night.

1894
01:44:38,190 --> 01:44:40,370
We now know, because we have a clock.

1895
01:44:44,110 --> 01:44:45,030
We're betting...

1896
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:48,670
One snake figurine.

1897
01:44:48,670 --> 01:44:50,110
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

1898
01:44:51,630 --> 01:44:54,110
Isn't this the type of zombie that doesn't die in sunlight?

1899
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:54,430
No.

1900
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:57,230
I'm betting you in my bed.

1901
01:44:58,670 --> 01:44:59,770
Oh my gosh.

1902
01:45:00,410 --> 01:45:01,530
Chiara, ruse.

1903
01:45:02,970 --> 01:45:04,370
Chiara, you're gonna have to fight.

1904
01:45:04,750 --> 01:45:08,250
Look, I'm a sought after commodity right now.

1905
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:11,110
You're gonna have to do better than that.

1906
01:45:11,710 --> 01:45:13,570
Look how popular I am.

1907
01:45:16,270 --> 01:45:17,310
Freaky Wawa.

1908
01:45:20,050 --> 01:45:22,410
Freaky Wawa is actually so perfect.

1909
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:29,960
You know how I have freak phantom glasses?

1910
01:45:30,140 --> 01:45:34,340
Someone needs to make ones for Chiara that say freak on one side and then Wawa.

1911
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:38,740
Or freaky on one side and then Wawa on the other side.

1912
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:39,920
Freaky Wawa.

1913
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:45,090
Oh, there's another guy.

1914
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:46,850
Gosh, I'm too popular.

1915
01:45:47,470 --> 01:45:49,190
All the husks want me.

1916
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:51,250
Look, they're groaning trying to get to me.

1917
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:55,640
Freaky Wawa.

1918
01:46:00,810 --> 01:46:02,710
Hashtag freaky Wawa.

1919
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:03,390
No!

1920
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:12,370
Another player has joined the team.

1921
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:17,970
I don't even think this creeper knows what he's...

1922
01:46:17,970 --> 01:46:19,330
Does he even know I'm up here?

1923
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:22,590
Does this guy even know?

1924
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:28,410
Or he's just here to join in on the party, yeah?

1925
01:46:28,770 --> 01:46:29,190
You think?

1926
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:31,070
He doesn't even... Oh gosh.

1927
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:32,010
Oh no, no, no.

1928
01:46:32,650 --> 01:46:33,850
There's a witch over there.

1929
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:34,550
Oh my gosh.

1930
01:46:35,470 --> 01:46:36,090
Oh no, no.

1931
01:46:37,110 --> 01:46:38,350
Do you guys enjoy this ASMR?

1932
01:46:39,690 --> 01:46:41,110
He just wants to mosh.

1933
01:46:49,370 --> 01:46:50,430
We're so fine.

1934
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:53,710
New girl at work?

1935
01:46:54,350 --> 01:46:56,290
Just quit after one week on the job?

1936
01:46:56,530 --> 01:46:57,230
No way.

1937
01:46:58,630 --> 01:47:00,290
I'd creep on you any day.

1938
01:47:02,050 --> 01:47:02,950
Tag yourself.

1939
01:47:03,070 --> 01:47:03,350
Oh wait.

1940
01:47:04,270 --> 01:47:04,690
Oh no.

1941
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:06,350
Oh wait, there's two creepers now!

1942
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:10,170
Uh, guys?

1943
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:12,630
Tag yourself.

1944
01:47:13,270 --> 01:47:14,270
Which one are you?

1945
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:25,680
All of them.

1946
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:28,080
Left one, that's you.

1947
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:30,460
Creeper on the left.

1948
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:31,620
I'm the spider.

1949
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,320
You're keeping a safe, respectable distance and we all...

1950
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:38,520
We all really appreciate that in these trying times.

1951
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:43,740
Look at their moshing!

1952
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:50,440
Give me something to break!

1953
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:54,180
About your fucking face!

1954
01:47:55,480 --> 01:48:00,220
If the zombies are set on fire later, shouldn't it logically set the creepers off?

1955
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:07,080
No...

1956
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:14,670
Why is there a normal zombie over there?

1957
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:16,870
How curious.

1958
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:19,690
It's almost sunlight!

1959
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:23,310
The sun will be rising!

1960
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:25,630
And then we'll go over there and we'll bet.

1961
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:29,270
You're standing on wood.

1962
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:31,530
Skelly?

1963
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:32,590
There's no Skelly around.

1964
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:33,930
We're OK.

1965
01:48:35,290 --> 01:48:36,310
Oh, here comes another guy.

1966
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:38,930
Are you kidding me?

1967
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:48,340
How is she going to escape?

1968
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:49,680
Very carefully.

1969
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:51,920
We're going to be fine.

1970
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,100
Look, this creeper doesn't care.

1971
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:54,620
Oh, nevermind.

1972
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:59,000
This menu is popping off.

1973
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:05,820
Why am I doing so well in my Minecraft era?

1974
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,680
I think I might have to build up more.

1975
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:16,280
Then they'll lose interest.

1976
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:20,960
And then we'll run.

1977
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:23,320
They're not losing interest.

1978
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,980
They're not losing interest, actually.

1979
01:49:33,650 --> 01:49:35,790
What a beautiful sunrise.

1980
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:39,310
Guys, are you enjoying all the new Minecraft features?

1981
01:49:40,570 --> 01:49:44,230
That I'm so easily able to show off to you guys.

1982
01:49:45,790 --> 01:49:46,770
Are you entertained?

1983
01:49:51,690 --> 01:49:52,370
Sunlight.

1984
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:00,580
Soon, things will catch on fire.

1985
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:02,660
Fire.

1986
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:06,380
Why aren't they catching on fire?

1987
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:15,020
See?

1988
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:16,960
Wait.

1989
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:23,680
Husks don't burn?

1990
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:02,350
Come here.

1991
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:04,130
I need food.

1992
01:51:15,170 --> 01:51:16,210
I

1993
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:21,280
just wanted a snack.

1994
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:22,880
Oh, they lost interest.

1995
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:24,200
They lost interest.

1996
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:30,260
Village incoming.

1997
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:31,760
3, 2, 1.

1998
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:32,580
Village!

1999
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,460
Oh my gosh, Lottie!

2000
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:06,380
Thank you for the rain.

2001
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:07,640
Thank you.

2002
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:11,880
Is this ever going to be the last Lottie rain?

2003
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:12,300
No.

2004
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:16,280
Please, why am I so bad?

2005
01:52:19,140 --> 01:52:20,400
Please, this is the worst.

2006
01:52:21,020 --> 01:52:23,320
At that point, I don't think I deserved to kill him.

2007
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:25,360
He was too good.

2008
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:29,020
Thank you for the gift.

2009
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:31,260
Thank you for the rain, Lottie.

2010
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:35,260
No.

2011
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:43,480
I'm currently having my luckiest and unluckiest ever Minecraft ever of my career.

2012
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:49,460
Oh my gosh, finally, we can play the game.

2013
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,660
Here we go, guys.

2014
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,280
Wait, were there more?

2015
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:58,480
Andrickos, thanks for the 10 gifted.

2016
01:52:58,740 --> 01:52:59,660
Pyrobug, thanks for the 5 gifted.

2017
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,420
Teeqoven, yanyan, thank you for the gifted.

2018
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:02,860
Spank, thanks for the 10 gifted.

2019
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:04,480
Thank you guys.

2020
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:05,820
Ikeastif2, thanks for the gifted.

2021
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:06,940
Bankido, thanks for the 5 gifted.

2022
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:08,000
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

2023
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:09,680
RugboyRabbit, thanks for the 5 gifted.

2024
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:10,900
Raymac, thanks for the gifted.

2025
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:14,480
Thank you guys.

2026
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:16,040
Thank you, thank you.

2027
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:18,380
Really appreciate it.

2028
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:19,940
Okay.

2029
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:20,020
Okay.

2030
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:22,900
Alright.

2031
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:25,580
We're playing Minecraft now.

2032
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:30,340
Holy moly.

2033
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:34,980
So, to give raiders any kind of...

2034
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:38,180
So I came in being like, I'm going to play in hardcore mode.

2035
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:43,540
And I'm going to play until I can find the Creaking, which was the first thing that I wanted to find.

2036
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:45,520
It's a new biome called the Pale Garden.

2037
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:52,940
I was like, we're going to find that, we're going to go find that guy, and we're going to be spooked, and it's going to be fun adventure times.

2038
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:59,400
And then my first world, I spawned right into it.

2039
01:54:00,940 --> 01:54:01,660
And then...

2040
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:03,400
Speedyfire, thanks for the 5 gifted.

2041
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:06,140
Thank you guys so much for all the gifted memberships.

2042
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:12,520
And then, I was like, okay, I died in that world because I was trying to show off.

2043
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:15,120
I was like, hey, check it out.

2044
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:22,000
But in world 2, I was just like, all right, we're going to go find fireflies, which you can only find, I guess...

2045
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,940
You can find them in swamps, but also in rivers, next to rivers.

2046
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:29,220
And so I was like, okay, we're going to...

2047
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:30,540
We're going to go find that.

2048
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:33,500
And then I spawned right next to some fireflies.

2049
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:40,780
And then in the third world, I was like, okay, we're going to go find a desert, because they added some things in the desert.

2050
01:54:46,190 --> 01:54:48,450
And wouldn't you know...

2051
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:52,850
Wouldn't you know...

2052
01:54:52,850 --> 01:54:54,210
Where am I right now?

2053
01:54:58,210 --> 01:54:59,650
It's so...

2054
01:54:59,650 --> 01:55:00,490
Curious.

2055
01:55:02,650 --> 01:55:04,090
Isn't it...

2056
01:55:04,090 --> 01:55:06,550
Isn't it just too curious how this is happening?

2057
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:08,950
I might be cheating.

2058
01:55:09,370 --> 01:55:10,030
I don't know.

2059
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:13,190
Manifested.

2060
01:55:16,030 --> 01:55:17,830
Hold on, double BGM.

2061
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:26,030
All right.

2062
01:55:29,110 --> 01:55:30,070
Onwards.

2063
01:55:32,250 --> 01:55:34,070
We're trying to find a village.

2064
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:36,870
Oh, and dinner.

2065
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:40,210
Nice.

2066
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:42,670
Yeah, baby.

2067
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:45,970
Will we find a village?

2068
01:55:46,250 --> 01:55:47,510
Actually, I don't think so.

2069
01:55:47,950 --> 01:55:49,350
This is looking pretty desolate.

2070
01:55:52,630 --> 01:55:55,130
What did I say I was going to go find now?

2071
01:55:55,630 --> 01:55:56,670
I can't remember.

2072
01:55:57,430 --> 01:55:58,710
I can't remember anymore.

2073
01:56:02,590 --> 01:56:03,990
They're too small for meat.

2074
01:56:05,990 --> 01:56:06,430
Fossil?

2075
01:56:06,490 --> 01:56:07,110
I didn't say that.

2076
01:56:07,190 --> 01:56:08,090
You guys said that.

2077
01:56:08,130 --> 01:56:09,470
You were like, go find a fossil.

2078
01:56:09,470 --> 01:56:09,650
Fossil.

2079
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:14,820
He's too good.

2080
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:15,340
He's juking.

2081
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:16,460
He's too good.

2082
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:18,080
Oh my gosh.

2083
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:19,500
How am I so bad actually?

2084
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,280
There we go.

2085
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:24,140
How am I so bad?

2086
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:33,300
I feel like I have no purpose.

2087
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:38,040
At least we can cook these bunnies now.

2088
01:56:47,710 --> 01:56:49,630
Here we're going to go defeat the wither.

2089
01:56:49,630 --> 01:56:50,490
I was?

2090
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:52,550
Okay.

2091
01:56:55,490 --> 01:56:57,350
Gotta go defeat the wither.

2092
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:08,120
I love these big coal veins.

2093
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:09,780
Oh yeah, baby.

2094
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:12,060
We all have a purpose.

2095
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:14,680
Well...

2096
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:15,320
What's mine?

2097
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:16,620
To hunt?

2098
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:20,660
To make spooky noises?

2099
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:21,700
To open your cabinets?

2100
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:25,780
To...

2101
01:57:25,780 --> 01:57:26,700
To possess your body?

2102
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:33,140
I demand fossil.

2103
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:36,200
But it's like so difficult, no?

2104
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,680
How does one find a fossil?

2105
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:43,720
Explain, everybody.

2106
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:45,140
Everybody explain.

2107
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:46,660
How does one find a fossil?

2108
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:49,860
I've never found one ever before.

2109
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:53,180
You just have to dig.

2110
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:54,380
Really, that's it?

2111
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,580
Look in the mirror.

2112
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:03,580
Fossil world.

2113
01:58:08,810 --> 01:58:10,610
I've never found one before.

2114
01:58:11,110 --> 01:58:11,570
Truly.

2115
01:58:12,010 --> 01:58:13,910
We would need a whole lot more coal.

2116
01:58:14,210 --> 01:58:15,210
And how deep are they?

2117
01:58:16,210 --> 01:58:16,850
Am fossil.

2118
01:58:20,090 --> 01:58:22,530
Kiara, crazy idea for your next video.

2119
01:58:23,230 --> 01:58:24,510
For your next am video.

2120
01:58:25,070 --> 01:58:25,670
Am fossil.

2121
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:34,100
You should do that next time you have...

2122
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:35,840
New debuts.

2123
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:37,040
Am fossil.

2124
01:58:45,390 --> 01:58:46,730
I guess we'll go digging.

2125
01:58:50,820 --> 01:58:52,320
A cosplay is you!

2126
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:58,240
Oh my gosh, you would look so cute.

2127
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:00,720
Good.

2128
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:02,580
Guys, we got Kiara in a maid outfit.

2129
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:04,080
Mission accomplished.

2130
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:05,860
Sunken ship?

2131
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:06,620
You saw one.

2132
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,780
Oh my gosh, it's like so intact.

2133
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:13,200
Wow.

2134
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:14,660
Okay, we'll go get it.

2135
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:16,160
Give me a second.

2136
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:21,060
I feel I must make some proper food.

2137
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:22,660
So while... Let's see.

2138
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:29,580
While this is cooking...

2139
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:33,820
While this is cooking, we'll keep digging.

2140
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:37,900
Your purpose is to be the ultimate ghost maid idol.

2141
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:42,780
One of those is optional, I suppose.

2142
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:45,520
But not the ghost and not the maid.

2143
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:52,680
Okay, and over here are some more.

2144
01:59:58,240 --> 01:59:59,080
Some more.

2145
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:01,100
Camel!

2146
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:03,560
Can I put the...

2147
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:04,760
Hold on.

2148
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:07,800
Can we put the horse... I mean, no, he's not a horse.

2149
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:09,940
Oh no, we need just a normal saddle, right?

2150
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,700
Dang, I was about to drip...

2151
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:18,580
Guys, do you see the sun at the moment?

2152
02:00:23,580 --> 02:00:24,440
That's not good.

2153
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:28,800
We're so cooked.

2154
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:29,220
Nah.

2155
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:32,060
We can do this.

2156
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:33,300
Make a bunch of torches.

2157
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:34,780
Or eight of them.

2158
02:00:35,740 --> 02:00:36,340
Hold on.

2159
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:38,000
I'm getting lost in the sauce.

2160
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:38,380
There we go.

2161
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:40,340
Okay.

2162
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:40,740
Torch.

2163
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:41,620
Tons of them.

2164
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:44,840
Fill this little island with torches.

2165
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:45,820
This is our safe zone.

2166
02:00:46,580 --> 02:00:48,000
It's not an island, but you get it.

2167
02:00:48,020 --> 02:00:48,540
You get what I mean.

2168
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:52,080
This is a safe... This is a safe zone.

2169
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:54,060
This is where nothing will spawn.

2170
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:56,920
I come back here...

2171
02:00:58,140 --> 02:00:59,600
It's totally good.

2172
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:06,540
Maybe.

2173
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:08,280
Totally is... Okay.

2174
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:11,100
It might be a bit like, you know...

2175
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:11,920
No, please come back.

2176
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:13,140
Please come back!

2177
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:14,640
I need dinner.

2178
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,500
I need dinner!

2179
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:17,220
Are you big?

2180
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:18,840
He looked kinda small.

2181
02:01:24,090 --> 02:01:26,090
I wasn't fast enough.

2182
02:01:29,010 --> 02:01:29,690
Okay.

2183
02:01:30,090 --> 02:01:30,590
We're fine.

2184
02:01:31,110 --> 02:01:32,290
Maybe a tiny house?

2185
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:35,770
Houses are for losers.

2186
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:38,250
I mean, you're totally right.

2187
02:01:38,530 --> 02:01:41,290
I probably should have a tiny house, but...

2188
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:45,870
If that camel is fine, I'm fine.

2189
02:01:46,270 --> 02:01:48,370
Camel is our indicator.

2190
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:54,240
Okay!

2191
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:56,780
This is pretty...

2192
02:01:56,780 --> 02:01:58,760
This feels spawn-proof, right?

2193
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:01,340
Alright, let's go yo-ho.

2194
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:04,980
Yo-ho, yo-ho!

2195
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:06,480
Powers live for me!

2196
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:07,900
I can't see anything!

2197
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:12,580
Alright, it's nice and lit.

2198
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:14,800
Craft a boat.

2199
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:16,660
You're so much smarter than me.

2200
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:20,360
Doors!

2201
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:24,440
Guys, can you tell it's been a long time since I've played Minecraft?

2202
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:28,520
Can you tell?

2203
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:29,700
It's been a while.

2204
02:02:29,700 --> 02:02:31,580
It's been a while.

2205
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:36,820
Since I've played a Minecraft game.

2206
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:38,580
It's been a while.

2207
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:41,180
Yes.

2208
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:46,880
It's because I don't have a server to play with anybody on.

2209
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:51,560
It's fine playing by myself too, but it's not the same, you know?

2210
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:56,300
I thought about maybe making like an indie...

2211
02:02:56,300 --> 02:03:00,140
Or like, yeah, some sort of indie VTuber server.

2212
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:04,840
Or just like, you know...

2213
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:07,980
I say indie, but like a server that anybody can join in.

2214
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,080
Okay, set the door down.

2215
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:19,280
Uh, shoot.

2216
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:22,560
Go, go, go, go, go...

2217
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:27,760
Why couldn't I set it down?

2218
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:29,620
Were those slabs or something?

2219
02:03:30,740 --> 02:03:31,240
Oh gosh.

2220
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:37,470
Please, let me in.

2221
02:03:37,670 --> 02:03:38,050
Let me in.

2222
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:38,670
Let me in.

2223
02:03:39,070 --> 02:03:39,910
I can't see!

2224
02:03:42,610 --> 02:03:43,990
I can't see anything.

2225
02:03:50,070 --> 02:03:50,770
There it is.

2226
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:00,700
Yeah!

2227
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:05,650
Nice find.

2228
02:04:07,470 --> 02:04:08,530
Come on, please.

2229
02:04:08,670 --> 02:04:09,570
I'm stuck!

2230
02:04:10,530 --> 02:04:12,030
Alright, let's go to the top.

2231
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:20,100
Doki SMP player base yearns for Mint Phantom.

2232
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:20,780
What?

2233
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:22,880
Oh, is that Doki's server?

2234
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:25,200
I thought that was for her members or whatever.

2235
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:26,840
No?

2236
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,020
A door.

2237
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:38,020
Potato!

2238
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:39,820
Carrot!

2239
02:04:39,940 --> 02:04:40,940
Oh yeah, baby.

2240
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:42,120
Let's take the paper too.

2241
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:45,540
Alright, nice.

2242
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:46,700
Nice, nice.

2243
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:49,000
That's good for us, I suppose.

2244
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:54,060
I can't see anything, you guys.

2245
02:04:54,080 --> 02:04:54,920
It's so bad.

2246
02:04:56,020 --> 02:04:58,500
I wish I could put something even on like...

2247
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:02,160
Treasure map.

2248
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:04,340
I'm taking everything.

2249
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:08,540
If only you had a light.

2250
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:12,700
I'm literally... It's in my hand.

2251
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:13,560
What?

2252
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:14,520
You think...

2253
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:15,480
If only you had a light.

2254
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:18,120
Yeah, in the total darkness that is night.

2255
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,040
Yeah.

2256
02:05:20,460 --> 02:05:23,460
And underwater where fire totally burns.

2257
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:28,500
Shall we go?

2258
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,400
Hunt for treasure!

2259
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:37,180
South.

2260
02:05:56,090 --> 02:05:57,610
See, pickles emit light.

2261
02:05:57,690 --> 02:05:59,350
Do they... If they are in your hand...

2262
02:05:59,990 --> 02:06:03,110
It's like the one time I... So sad, don't have shaders, you know?

2263
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:07,290
When you are like... Needing...

2264
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:11,370
A light source.

2265
02:06:12,130 --> 02:06:12,530
Oh, whoops.

2266
02:06:12,650 --> 02:06:12,870
My bad.

2267
02:06:14,590 --> 02:06:15,950
How far is this?

2268
02:06:18,530 --> 02:06:20,350
How far down is this?

2269
02:06:24,050 --> 02:06:24,690
Southeast.

2270
02:06:25,010 --> 02:06:26,410
Wait, I'm going south.

2271
02:06:26,910 --> 02:06:28,630
And then this is... So, southeast.

2272
02:06:30,170 --> 02:06:31,910
I'm a little directionally...

2273
02:06:33,290 --> 02:06:33,930
Impaired.

2274
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:36,330
Don't shoot me.

2275
02:06:36,770 --> 02:06:37,350
Don't shoot me.

2276
02:06:37,730 --> 02:06:38,550
Don't shoot me.

2277
02:06:38,930 --> 02:06:39,890
Don't shoot me.

2278
02:06:41,530 --> 02:06:42,650
Don't shoot me.

2279
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:47,460
Mesa biome.

2280
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:48,360
Biome.

2281
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:56,300
I think we are gonna... I think we are on the brink of discovery.

2282
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:57,380
Of a village.

2283
02:06:58,040 --> 02:06:58,800
I believe.

2284
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:00,400
It's like right there.

2285
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:02,180
I can taste it.

2286
02:07:02,620 --> 02:07:03,680
I can taste it.

2287
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:07,500
I can hear the villagers, their cries to be pillaged.

2288
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:09,280
Wait, the fireflies!

2289
02:07:09,980 --> 02:07:11,140
Do you guys see that right there?

2290
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:12,860
The little glowing light?

2291
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:15,540
Those are fireflies!

2292
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:18,620
Kojima-san, watch Captain America...

2293
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:20,700
What just hit me?

2294
02:07:24,810 --> 02:07:25,670
What just hit me?

2295
02:07:26,450 --> 02:07:28,150
Oh, I think it's drowned.

2296
02:07:29,390 --> 02:07:30,090
Look at them!

2297
02:07:30,150 --> 02:07:31,430
They are so cute!

2298
02:07:35,960 --> 02:07:37,340
They are so pretty!

2299
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:40,400
You can hear them buzzing.

2300
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:54,320
Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up...

2301
02:07:55,860 --> 02:07:57,220
They are mine now.

2302
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:03,580
Ok, now they are ours.

2303
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:06,580
Anyway, what was I saying?

2304
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:08,360
Oh, there was a super chat.

2305
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:08,740
Hold on.

2306
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:10,640
Oh, I passed it!

2307
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:13,560
One second.

2308
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:17,880
Let me read it, let me read it.

2309
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:23,500
I did see his tweet about watching Captain America and said he was confused.

2310
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:26,460
I'm so... Ok.

2311
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:29,720
I know it's not Kingdom Hearts' fault.

2312
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:31,860
But I still blame Kingdom Hearts.

2313
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:33,960
Ok, it's just like a personal thing.

2314
02:08:37,140 --> 02:08:38,260
But having...

2315
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:39,880
The fact that...

2316
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:45,920
To follow a mainline story, you have to literally...

2317
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:47,920
And I blame Kingdom Hearts because...

2318
02:08:49,420 --> 02:08:55,860
They had the mobile game that you had to play to also understand the story, you know?

2319
02:08:57,320 --> 02:09:00,980
And that's basically what it is here now with Marvel.

2320
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:03,820
You have to watch every single show.

2321
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:09,040
You have to just dedicate your life, your afterlife...

2322
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:10,700
Any of your time...

2323
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:12,180
Oh wow, skelly party.

2324
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:13,400
To...

2325
02:09:13,900 --> 02:09:16,180
To the single...

2326
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:17,320
Content.

2327
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:18,660
Sorry.

2328
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:20,480
The music scared me.

2329
02:09:22,340 --> 02:09:24,080
I just watched recaps on YouTube?

2330
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:25,180
That's so smart.

2331
02:09:30,630 --> 02:09:35,830
But yeah, I only blame Kingdom Hearts because, you know, it's just a personal thing.

2332
02:09:36,410 --> 02:09:38,130
This music with the...

2333
02:09:39,630 --> 02:09:41,090
With the fireflies.

2334
02:09:41,510 --> 02:09:42,110
It's so beautiful.

2335
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:44,110
There, there, there, there.

2336
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:49,500
Oh my gosh, look at all the fireflies!

2337
02:10:01,130 --> 02:10:02,630
It sounds like summer.

2338
02:10:31,330 --> 02:10:33,830
We can watch the fireflies while the sky is on fire.

2339
02:10:36,830 --> 02:10:37,270
Fireflies!

2340
02:10:38,910 --> 02:10:39,350
Dummy.

2341
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:48,600
I think they only come out at night though, obviously.

2342
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:53,280
You would not believe your eyes.

2343
02:10:58,030 --> 02:10:59,450
Let's take these ones too.

2344
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:00,690
Next time it's night.

2345
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,280
This song is so pretty, what the heck?

2346
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:14,400
I love Minecraft music.

2347
02:11:20,130 --> 02:11:22,770
You would not believe your eyes.

2348
02:11:23,370 --> 02:11:25,590
You would not believe your eyes.

2349
02:11:25,890 --> 02:11:28,810
You would not believe your eyes.

2350
02:11:28,830 --> 02:11:30,490
Look at the piggies!

2351
02:11:30,490 --> 02:11:32,610
Oh, their curly tail!

2352
02:11:32,770 --> 02:11:33,550
Let me see your butt.

2353
02:11:36,390 --> 02:11:38,270
You're gonna be on my plate tonight.

2354
02:11:41,450 --> 02:11:42,250
Come here.

2355
02:11:42,750 --> 02:11:43,190
Come here.

2356
02:11:43,830 --> 02:11:44,530
Dinner time.

2357
02:11:44,990 --> 02:11:45,530
Dinner time.

2358
02:11:50,610 --> 02:11:51,210
Nice.

2359
02:11:52,330 --> 02:11:53,770
I wonder if we can find a...

2360
02:11:55,490 --> 02:11:56,430
What's it called?

2361
02:11:57,030 --> 02:12:01,370
I've always wanted to... I think I've only found one like ever naturally once.

2362
02:12:01,370 --> 02:12:03,370
But the...

2363
02:12:04,790 --> 02:12:06,730
The jungle ruins?

2364
02:12:07,090 --> 02:12:07,850
They're so cool.

2365
02:12:07,930 --> 02:12:10,450
I wish there were more structures like that, you know?

2366
02:12:11,310 --> 02:12:12,430
They're so fun.

2367
02:12:12,890 --> 02:12:13,950
They're so neat.

2368
02:12:16,450 --> 02:12:17,430
Coco beans?

2369
02:12:17,590 --> 02:12:17,950
Nice.

2370
02:12:19,790 --> 02:12:21,610
Look at these guys!

2371
02:12:21,790 --> 02:12:25,370
They have the horns, but they're not so fuzzy as the...

2372
02:12:27,910 --> 02:12:29,190
As the...

2373
02:12:31,370 --> 02:12:32,150
The treasure.

2374
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:33,350
What treasure?

2375
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:41,740
Oh, my treasure from the boat.

2376
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:42,300
You're right.

2377
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:45,840
Let's go find treasure.

2378
02:12:46,620 --> 02:12:47,360
Where are we?

2379
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:51,620
I passed over it, so all I have to do is go backwards.

2380
02:12:54,140 --> 02:12:55,060
Don't worry.

2381
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:56,500
Where's my boat?

2382
02:13:00,190 --> 02:13:02,550
My boat is...

2383
02:13:02,550 --> 02:13:03,490
Over here?

2384
02:13:08,450 --> 02:13:10,570
I thought you meant treasure from...

2385
02:13:12,510 --> 02:13:12,990
The...

2386
02:13:14,130 --> 02:13:16,330
From the ruins.

2387
02:13:18,450 --> 02:13:19,230
There's my boat.

2388
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:20,710
Okay, we just gotta go backwards.

2389
02:13:32,230 --> 02:13:34,450
Yeah, Chiara is the only one allowed to backseat.

2390
02:13:35,170 --> 02:13:38,370
And it's not really backseating, it's her just, you know...

2391
02:13:40,330 --> 02:13:43,370
I mean, is an Oshi ever wrong?

2392
02:13:43,370 --> 02:13:44,090
No.

2393
02:13:45,870 --> 02:13:48,370
That's just a fact.

2394
02:13:49,390 --> 02:13:51,030
Your Oshi is never incorrect.

2395
02:13:56,010 --> 02:13:58,710
Wait, uh...

2396
02:13:58,710 --> 02:14:00,810
Yeah, that's where the skelly party was.

2397
02:14:03,470 --> 02:14:04,650
Warm cows.

2398
02:14:08,190 --> 02:14:10,570
Remember when your Oshi told you to play Sisyphus?

2399
02:14:10,570 --> 02:14:13,190
And you know what?

2400
02:14:13,210 --> 02:14:14,430
I learned a lesson.

2401
02:14:17,590 --> 02:14:19,070
About, wait...

2402
02:14:19,070 --> 02:14:20,780
Myself, and...

2403
02:14:25,930 --> 02:14:26,670
About...

2404
02:14:26,670 --> 02:14:28,890
You know, a lot of things.

2405
02:14:30,830 --> 02:14:32,570
I think it's right...

2406
02:14:34,390 --> 02:14:36,700
It shows on the map, but...

2407
02:14:42,990 --> 02:14:44,570
We might have to...

2408
02:14:44,570 --> 02:14:46,130
We might have to walk.

2409
02:14:50,510 --> 02:14:51,510
Alright.

2410
02:14:53,670 --> 02:14:55,230
For dinner!

2411
02:14:57,790 --> 02:14:59,630
I hate catching the rabbits.

2412
02:15:00,970 --> 02:15:03,810
Good enough.

2413
02:15:04,150 --> 02:15:04,350
Alright.

2414
02:15:05,230 --> 02:15:05,730
Onwards.

2415
02:15:07,270 --> 02:15:08,990
So it's like...

2416
02:15:10,430 --> 02:15:12,270
North, east, right?

2417
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:21,600
This is like the food run.

2418
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:23,980
I'm finally getting a lot of food.

2419
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:26,640
East, and this is north?

2420
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:30,280
Northeast, yeah.

2421
02:15:30,620 --> 02:15:31,380
I'm going the right way.

2422
02:15:34,860 --> 02:15:35,600
Thank you.

2423
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:38,840
Finally getting food, I've been starving.

2424
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:42,100
I've been starving in all my other playthroughs!

2425
02:15:52,490 --> 02:15:54,570
Guys, remember that village I talked about?

2426
02:15:54,730 --> 02:15:55,490
It's gonna happen.

2427
02:15:58,230 --> 02:16:00,330
These biomes always have a village.

2428
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:05,320
I love the curly ones.

2429
02:16:09,290 --> 02:16:11,890
I love the curly... Do they all have curly butts?

2430
02:16:11,990 --> 02:16:12,810
I just never noticed.

2431
02:16:14,590 --> 02:16:16,950
They look like they have flatter ears too.

2432
02:16:17,610 --> 02:16:19,910
These don't look like pigs anymore, they look like dogs.

2433
02:16:22,610 --> 02:16:25,790
I thought my heart couldn't fit anymore VTubers, but Mint is a ghost.

2434
02:16:27,470 --> 02:16:29,850
Also, I'm glad you enjoyed the Fireball animation.

2435
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:31,030
Thanks Fireball!

2436
02:16:31,770 --> 02:16:33,490
I love that show.

2437
02:16:33,790 --> 02:16:35,670
It's so witty, it's so cute, it's so fun.

2438
02:16:38,130 --> 02:16:38,650
No!

2439
02:16:44,410 --> 02:16:45,410
Don't be greedy.

2440
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:52,940
They are more boar-like, you think?

2441
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:55,020
Is that an armadillo?

2442
02:16:59,420 --> 02:17:00,620
Armadillo!

2443
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:07,860
He's so cute.

2444
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:20,920
The loot?

2445
02:17:21,320 --> 02:17:22,200
We're getting there.

2446
02:17:24,020 --> 02:17:25,140
We're getting there.

2447
02:17:28,060 --> 02:17:29,260
Armadillo.

2448
02:17:36,560 --> 02:17:37,080
Uh...

2449
02:17:38,780 --> 02:17:40,640
It's like right...

2450
02:17:48,620 --> 02:17:49,660
Over there!

2451
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:00,220
Oh, come on.

2452
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:05,300
I mean, I could tell from the map that I'd be in the sea, but...

2453
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:12,480
What?

2454
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:17,480
It's like...

2455
02:18:21,980 --> 02:18:24,400
Do you think there's a chance it could be exposed?

2456
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:28,240
You got a door, I got a single door.

2457
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:33,600
Let's see, am I on...

2458
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:35,600
I'm like basically on it.

2459
02:18:47,810 --> 02:18:48,910
I didn't make one.

2460
02:18:48,990 --> 02:18:49,450
It's fine though.

2461
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:49,970
Oh!

2462
02:18:50,110 --> 02:18:50,590
It's right there!

2463
02:18:50,630 --> 02:18:51,090
We got it!

2464
02:18:51,710 --> 02:18:52,070
Yippee!

2465
02:18:55,010 --> 02:18:55,890
Water breathing!

2466
02:18:56,070 --> 02:18:57,710
Ok, let's get rid of some stuff that we don't need.

2467
02:18:58,830 --> 02:19:00,490
This and this.

2468
02:19:00,990 --> 02:19:02,030
Oh my gold!

2469
02:19:02,090 --> 02:19:03,270
My cooked salmon!

2470
02:19:04,670 --> 02:19:05,390
Heart of the sea.

2471
02:19:05,490 --> 02:19:08,470
We don't really need the Heart of the Sea, I don't think, right?

2472
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:13,780
I'm not trying to build a...

2473
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:16,160
A thingy.

2474
02:19:20,580 --> 02:19:21,460
My door?

2475
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:23,100
I can always make a new door.

2476
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:25,460
Brown sheep!

2477
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:30,640
Come on, you're gonna make me a bed.

2478
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:32,260
You're gonna make me a bed.

2479
02:19:33,540 --> 02:19:34,240
Alright, hold on.

2480
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:35,800
Let's set up some stuff here.

2481
02:19:37,460 --> 02:19:39,220
Where did I put my crafting table?

2482
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:47,370
Didn't I just make a crafting table?

2483
02:19:52,020 --> 02:19:52,900
Inventory chaos.

2484
02:19:52,980 --> 02:19:53,760
Don't worry about it.

2485
02:19:54,620 --> 02:19:55,760
Don't worry about it.

2486
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:04,240
Where...

2487
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:05,380
What?

2488
02:20:09,670 --> 02:20:10,110
Twig!

2489
02:20:10,170 --> 02:20:11,250
Thank you so much for the raid!

2490
02:20:12,430 --> 02:20:13,450
Did I not make the table?

2491
02:20:13,450 --> 02:20:14,010
What?

2492
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:27,370
I literally...

2493
02:20:27,370 --> 02:20:28,970
I don't know.

2494
02:20:30,090 --> 02:20:30,410
OK

2495
02:20:33,550 --> 02:20:35,610
I don't think I have enough for a furnace.

2496
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:36,670
I don't.

2497
02:20:37,610 --> 02:20:38,470
That's OK.

2498
02:20:40,130 --> 02:20:40,770
Bread.

2499
02:20:47,630 --> 02:20:49,230
I don't need you.

2500
02:20:50,190 --> 02:20:51,470
Let's go...

2501
02:20:51,470 --> 02:20:52,150
Bed.

2502
02:20:52,450 --> 02:20:52,990
Bed!

2503
02:20:53,310 --> 02:20:53,970
Bed, bread!

2504
02:21:00,660 --> 02:21:02,560
We finally have a bed, everybody.

2505
02:21:03,180 --> 02:21:05,180
We finally have a bed!

2506
02:21:18,870 --> 02:21:21,770
Now you can respawn, except I can't.

2507
02:21:21,790 --> 02:21:22,310
We're in hardcore.

2508
02:21:24,030 --> 02:21:24,890
I can't.

2509
02:21:24,930 --> 02:21:25,950
There's no respawning.

2510
02:21:26,310 --> 02:21:27,830
Hot dog, indeed.

2511
02:21:28,910 --> 02:21:29,930
Alright, what are we doing?

2512
02:21:31,370 --> 02:21:32,090
The bed?

2513
02:21:32,290 --> 02:21:32,650
OK.

2514
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:44,550
So we got a bed.

2515
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:46,990
Let's go mine some...

2516
02:21:49,710 --> 02:21:50,910
I don't need that.

2517
02:21:53,230 --> 02:21:55,110
Where was the treasure chest?

2518
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:56,090
It was like over here, right?

2519
02:21:56,630 --> 02:21:58,610
I think I left my table down there.

2520
02:21:58,730 --> 02:21:59,130
Yeah, I did.

2521
02:21:59,310 --> 02:22:00,410
Or my... table.

2522
02:22:01,150 --> 02:22:02,130
My... door.

2523
02:22:02,650 --> 02:22:03,970
I'm just gonna put the...

2524
02:22:05,970 --> 02:22:08,170
I'm just gonna put the treasure map back in there.

2525
02:22:08,410 --> 02:22:10,310
I'm gonna put some other stuff in there that we don't need.

2526
02:22:11,010 --> 02:22:11,210
OK.

2527
02:22:12,710 --> 02:22:13,590
Make some chests.

2528
02:22:13,830 --> 02:22:15,950
How do you make a bundle?

2529
02:22:17,190 --> 02:22:18,910
How do you make the bundles?

2530
02:22:19,790 --> 02:22:21,670
The things that you can actually carry with you.

2531
02:22:21,870 --> 02:22:23,190
Chests are so...

2532
02:22:23,190 --> 02:22:27,910
Chests are useless to make unless you are settled down, you know?

2533
02:22:28,010 --> 02:22:28,710
But we're not.

2534
02:22:29,090 --> 02:22:30,050
We're adventurers.

2535
02:22:31,010 --> 02:22:32,110
Leather and string.

2536
02:22:32,710 --> 02:22:34,170
I have rabbit hide.

2537
02:22:34,170 --> 02:22:36,270
It's basically some leather.

2538
02:22:37,190 --> 02:22:39,170
Alright, let's just go...

2539
02:22:39,170 --> 02:22:40,510
Dig some stone.

2540
02:22:41,630 --> 02:22:42,310
Real quick.

2541
02:22:45,970 --> 02:22:47,270
Right there.

2542
02:22:48,890 --> 02:22:49,850
Right there.

2543
02:22:51,310 --> 02:22:52,190
Excuse me.

2544
02:22:52,670 --> 02:22:53,030
Excuse me.

2545
02:22:53,430 --> 02:22:53,890
Excuse me.

2546
02:22:54,090 --> 02:22:54,510
Excuse me.

2547
02:22:54,850 --> 02:22:55,250
Excuse me.

2548
02:22:55,590 --> 02:22:56,270
Yeah, OK.

2549
02:23:02,260 --> 02:23:04,440
That was a single stone.

2550
02:23:06,220 --> 02:23:06,660
Latte!

2551
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:08,320
Welcome to my mushroom patch.

2552
02:23:10,460 --> 02:23:10,900
Cool.

2553
02:23:16,340 --> 02:23:16,780
Anymore?

2554
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:18,540
I don't wanna dig up...

2555
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:20,440
I don't have any... I don't have a shovel, so...

2556
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,140
Too lazy to make one.

2557
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:26,360
Too lazy to make one, not too lazy to run all over a map, though.

2558
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:27,800
In search of stone.

2559
02:23:31,690 --> 02:23:32,650
Congrats on your stone.

2560
02:23:32,730 --> 02:23:33,190
Thank you.

2561
02:23:36,090 --> 02:23:36,270
Run!

2562
02:23:44,490 --> 02:23:46,690
Alright, we shall dig for stone.

2563
02:23:48,430 --> 02:23:51,050
Just like the ancestors did.

2564
02:23:55,890 --> 02:23:57,850
Oh, I just noticed I have this azalea.

2565
02:23:57,930 --> 02:23:58,790
Where did this come from?

2566
02:24:00,970 --> 02:24:02,950
Can I put the flower on top?

2567
02:24:06,950 --> 02:24:08,910
Oh my gosh!

2568
02:24:10,390 --> 02:24:11,670
It's too cute!

2569
02:24:11,670 --> 02:24:15,350
Wait, imagine you have the one that has the flowers on it.

2570
02:24:17,830 --> 02:24:18,430
Imagine.

2571
02:24:21,410 --> 02:24:23,510
This guy is out here searching for his family.

2572
02:24:24,230 --> 02:24:24,810
Don't worry.

2573
02:24:25,790 --> 02:24:26,450
You'll go back.

2574
02:24:26,650 --> 02:24:27,870
You'll join them.

2575
02:24:30,110 --> 02:24:31,050
Fucking stone.

2576
02:24:32,030 --> 02:24:35,250
We're gonna waste our stone to make a stone shovel.

2577
02:24:35,690 --> 02:24:36,590
Our single stone.

2578
02:24:36,590 --> 02:24:36,710
Dude.

2579
02:24:57,510 --> 02:24:58,970
Now we can make a furnace.

2580
02:25:01,050 --> 02:25:02,050
Good stuff.

2581
02:25:03,610 --> 02:25:05,150
We'll grab some extra, even.

2582
02:25:09,350 --> 02:25:10,510
Putting that stone to good use.

2583
02:25:11,950 --> 02:25:12,510
Absolutely.

2584
02:25:13,810 --> 02:25:15,490
All stone is good stone.

2585
02:25:16,750 --> 02:25:18,130
Spend money to make money.

2586
02:25:18,530 --> 02:25:19,090
Exactly!

2587
02:25:20,690 --> 02:25:21,250
Exactly.

2588
02:25:27,580 --> 02:25:29,700
I don't think anything will spawn in there.

2589
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:31,980
Seems too light still.

2590
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:40,000
Okay.

2591
02:25:40,540 --> 02:25:41,620
Furnace time.

2592
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:43,980
For.

2593
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:46,120
Furnish.

2594
02:25:47,420 --> 02:25:47,720
Okay.

2595
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:50,940
Lode stone is for when you die, right?

2596
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:56,540
Doesn't it also act as a...

2597
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:58,260
As a...

2598
02:25:58,260 --> 02:25:59,620
Like a spawn point?

2599
02:26:00,260 --> 02:26:03,100
I've never made one because they only recently...

2600
02:26:03,540 --> 02:26:05,720
Made it easier to be able to get one.

2601
02:26:06,340 --> 02:26:07,480
Oh, it's for the compass.

2602
02:26:08,840 --> 02:26:09,680
Just kidding.

2603
02:26:19,870 --> 02:26:21,370
Where did all my coal go?

2604
02:26:26,010 --> 02:26:27,590
All the coal I mined.

2605
02:26:28,790 --> 02:26:30,450
Did I spend it all on torches?

2606
02:26:36,210 --> 02:26:37,730
You left it in the other...

2607
02:26:37,730 --> 02:26:39,350
I left it in the other furnace.

2608
02:26:39,350 --> 02:26:39,530
Furnace.

2609
02:26:50,370 --> 02:26:51,830
We can go back.

2610
02:26:54,430 --> 02:26:56,170
We know the direction.

2611
02:26:57,550 --> 02:26:58,030
We know.

2612
02:26:59,150 --> 02:27:01,570
We are adventurers and we have the adventure sense.

2613
02:27:10,900 --> 02:27:11,650
Can we though?

2614
02:27:11,970 --> 02:27:12,930
Yeah, we can.

2615
02:27:14,030 --> 02:27:15,170
We can.

2616
02:27:15,970 --> 02:27:18,830
And it will be so easy to find.

2617
02:27:19,630 --> 02:27:21,790
I love all the coral.

2618
02:27:22,310 --> 02:27:24,130
It's so pretty and cute.

2619
02:27:25,090 --> 02:27:26,710
I love it very much.

2620
02:27:26,850 --> 02:27:28,730
It was like right around the corner.

2621
02:27:29,390 --> 02:27:30,590
It's like right over here.

2622
02:27:31,630 --> 02:27:33,950
It's like right there.

2623
02:27:34,590 --> 02:27:35,270
Right there.

2624
02:27:35,910 --> 02:27:38,030
Right there.

2625
02:27:38,450 --> 02:27:38,990
Right there.

2626
02:27:39,870 --> 02:27:41,030
Right down there.

2627
02:27:42,370 --> 02:27:43,970
Right there?

2628
02:27:44,810 --> 02:27:45,350
Wait.

2629
02:27:46,670 --> 02:27:49,210
I think we are okay.

2630
02:27:54,050 --> 02:27:55,130
Right...

2631
02:27:55,130 --> 02:27:57,070
No, it was a little more...

2632
02:27:57,790 --> 02:27:59,750
Is that the sun going down?

2633
02:27:59,990 --> 02:28:01,310
No, it's midday.

2634
02:28:04,570 --> 02:28:05,510
Right...

2635
02:28:05,510 --> 02:28:07,570
Right there!

2636
02:28:08,430 --> 02:28:09,290
See?

2637
02:28:09,290 --> 02:28:09,570
See?

2638
02:28:12,010 --> 02:28:12,570
See?

2639
02:28:15,230 --> 02:28:16,970
A pirate's favorite leather.

2640
02:28:19,150 --> 02:28:20,050
Remember to eat.

2641
02:28:20,190 --> 02:28:22,770
I know that's why we needed the furnace.

2642
02:28:25,730 --> 02:28:27,750
We got a little lost in the sauce.

2643
02:28:28,870 --> 02:28:30,750
But we are back to our safe base.

2644
02:28:31,210 --> 02:28:31,770
See?

2645
02:28:32,690 --> 02:28:33,910
Now we can eat.

2646
02:28:38,490 --> 02:28:39,830
I thought it was R.

2647
02:28:39,970 --> 02:28:40,690
Apparently not.

2648
02:28:41,030 --> 02:28:42,450
And I had to walk the plank earlier.

2649
02:28:43,090 --> 02:28:43,790
And you should too.

2650
02:28:48,170 --> 02:28:51,650
Guys, I'm sorry that I'm not doing anything.

2651
02:28:52,450 --> 02:28:55,330
I'm sorry that this Minecraft stream has...

2652
02:28:55,910 --> 02:28:56,730
Zero direction.

2653
02:28:57,830 --> 02:28:58,170
You know?

2654
02:29:00,290 --> 02:29:01,450
It's just...

2655
02:29:01,450 --> 02:29:03,090
Maybe we are finding our purpose.

2656
02:29:04,070 --> 02:29:04,650
Somehow.

2657
02:29:04,930 --> 02:29:05,410
Someway.

2658
02:29:05,410 --> 02:29:06,230
You know?

2659
02:29:06,850 --> 02:29:09,530
Everybody finds their purpose at their own pace.

2660
02:29:11,630 --> 02:29:14,550
Sometimes life hands you exactly what you need.

2661
02:29:14,690 --> 02:29:15,650
But you say, I know.

2662
02:29:16,150 --> 02:29:18,130
It wasn't about getting it the easy way.

2663
02:29:18,190 --> 02:29:19,110
It was about the journey.

2664
02:29:19,910 --> 02:29:22,070
But when you don't have the journey, what do you do?

2665
02:29:24,430 --> 02:29:28,030
What do you do when you've been deprived of the journey?

2666
02:29:40,650 --> 02:29:41,930
Wander with friends.

2667
02:29:43,050 --> 02:29:44,670
I'm alone on this boat.

2668
02:29:46,830 --> 02:29:48,890
This is a solo mission.

2669
02:29:52,650 --> 02:29:54,330
I'm gonna take all these back.

2670
02:29:54,650 --> 02:29:56,150
And we're gonna abandon this place.

2671
02:30:10,050 --> 02:30:13,050
Let's cook while we take all of our torches back.

2672
02:30:14,790 --> 02:30:16,450
Did you think they were for keepsakes?

2673
02:30:16,790 --> 02:30:17,110
No.

2674
02:30:18,010 --> 02:30:19,110
Absolutely not.

2675
02:30:21,750 --> 02:30:23,670
What's something we should try and find?

2676
02:30:24,510 --> 02:30:25,570
Not... Don't say fossil.

2677
02:30:28,230 --> 02:30:29,930
I guess we could just dig.

2678
02:30:31,470 --> 02:30:33,070
And dig and dig.

2679
02:30:34,130 --> 02:30:35,610
And dig and never stop digging.

2680
02:30:36,030 --> 02:30:36,650
Just in a hole.

2681
02:30:37,450 --> 02:30:38,750
One line all the way.

2682
02:30:40,670 --> 02:30:41,890
We could just go forever.

2683
02:30:42,070 --> 02:30:44,410
I mean, that's the mine part of Minecraft, is it not?

2684
02:30:46,770 --> 02:30:47,250
Diamonds?

2685
02:30:48,410 --> 02:30:49,630
We could find diamonds.

2686
02:30:53,980 --> 02:30:56,780
I thought that was a little baby...

2687
02:30:56,780 --> 02:31:00,160
I thought that was a baby dolphin for a second.

2688
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:01,340
A village?

2689
02:31:03,960 --> 02:31:06,140
The village is in our hearts.

2690
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:09,840
Clearly my sense was completely wrong.

2691
02:31:15,710 --> 02:31:18,610
I could have sworn I smelled a village around the corner.

2692
02:31:19,850 --> 02:31:20,850
I really did.

2693
02:31:21,950 --> 02:31:23,450
Maybe I just need a shower.

2694
02:31:24,290 --> 02:31:24,670
I don't know.

2695
02:31:28,350 --> 02:31:29,550
Cherry forest?

2696
02:31:29,790 --> 02:31:30,730
That would be fun.

2697
02:31:34,530 --> 02:31:35,650
Okay, we'll try for cherry.

2698
02:31:36,510 --> 02:31:38,790
Let's just go on the ocean blue and see where it takes us.

2699
02:31:42,440 --> 02:31:43,840
I think that's all of them.

2700
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:50,840
Yep.

2701
02:31:51,660 --> 02:31:52,060
Nice.

2702
02:31:55,270 --> 02:31:57,630
Okay, I'm gonna need you to speed this up a little bit now.

2703
02:32:02,390 --> 02:32:04,610
I'm gonna need you to be a little bit faster.

2704
02:32:06,030 --> 02:32:06,550
Um...

2705
02:32:07,450 --> 02:32:07,970
Uh...

2706
02:32:08,590 --> 02:32:10,190
You know...

2707
02:32:10,190 --> 02:32:14,510
I'm gonna need you to be like 10 times faster than what you are right now.

2708
02:32:15,110 --> 02:32:16,750
I'm gonna need you to really pick up the pace.

2709
02:32:19,950 --> 02:32:20,470
Uh...

2710
02:32:20,470 --> 02:32:21,750
We'll take this.

2711
02:32:24,610 --> 02:32:25,130
Uh...

2712
02:32:26,130 --> 02:32:26,650
Yep.

2713
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:31,600
I could sleep, but...

2714
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:32,500
What's the fun in that?

2715
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:33,840
It's okay.

2716
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:35,480
We're armed and we're dangerous.

2717
02:32:35,960 --> 02:32:37,900
Wait, I missed one.

2718
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:39,600
Haha.

2719
02:32:43,490 --> 02:32:45,210
We're armed and we're dangerous.

2720
02:32:46,170 --> 02:32:47,550
Nothing would mess with us, probably.

2721
02:32:48,230 --> 02:32:48,570
Oh!

2722
02:32:49,130 --> 02:32:49,830
Yes, let's go.

2723
02:32:54,890 --> 02:32:57,270
See ya, suckers!

2724
02:33:04,870 --> 02:33:05,470
Again?

2725
02:33:05,830 --> 02:33:06,550
What do you mean again?

2726
02:33:09,150 --> 02:33:10,350
What are you guys saying?

2727
02:33:10,350 --> 02:33:11,970
Why are you guys saying again again?

2728
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:22,960
What?

2729
02:33:23,260 --> 02:33:24,420
I'm confused.

2730
02:33:30,550 --> 02:33:32,270
It's from Marvel Rivals?

2731
02:33:32,370 --> 02:33:33,810
Why would you bring that into my chat?

2732
02:33:35,430 --> 02:33:36,050
What?

2733
02:33:36,490 --> 02:33:38,530
Why would you even...

2734
02:33:38,530 --> 02:33:38,770
What?

2735
02:33:40,370 --> 02:33:42,490
Don't bring your brain right here.

2736
02:33:44,070 --> 02:33:44,510
Nasty.

2737
02:33:46,030 --> 02:33:48,030
You are not welcome in this space.

2738
02:33:48,030 --> 02:33:48,490
Haha.

2739
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:55,780
You are not welcome here.

2740
02:33:58,280 --> 02:34:01,340
Not Marvel Rivals, brain right!

2741
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:06,220
I don't even know...

2742
02:34:06,220 --> 02:34:09,140
I don't even know anything about Marvel, you guys.

2743
02:34:09,220 --> 02:34:10,300
Is Iron Man Marvel?

2744
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:17,300
Wait, is this one of those underground...

2745
02:34:18,620 --> 02:34:19,340
Temples?

2746
02:34:19,340 --> 02:34:21,580
Do you think there will be...

2747
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:23,160
Sea zombies here?

2748
02:34:28,800 --> 02:34:30,480
If only I had a duster.

2749
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:35,320
I don't see any, guys.

2750
02:34:37,560 --> 02:34:39,500
Oh, I don't see anything, actually.

2751
02:34:46,460 --> 02:34:48,820
I don't have a...

2752
02:34:48,820 --> 02:34:50,100
No, I didn't...

2753
02:34:50,100 --> 02:34:51,440
Why did I come down here?

2754
02:34:51,560 --> 02:34:52,200
I don't have anything.

2755
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:53,660
I thought there might be...

2756
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:57,240
Ok, that guy has a trident.

2757
02:34:57,340 --> 02:34:57,860
We need to leave.

2758
02:34:58,280 --> 02:34:58,740
I see him.

2759
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:00,320
There is a guy over there with a trident.

2760
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:02,260
But there is the thing.

2761
02:35:03,140 --> 02:35:03,780
The movie?

2762
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:05,880
Wait, is he... No, that guy?

2763
02:35:06,040 --> 02:35:09,380
Wait, from the movie, the thing...

2764
02:35:09,380 --> 02:35:10,820
Is in Marvel Rivals?

2765
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:12,780
One does not simply say...

2766
02:35:12,780 --> 02:35:14,220
Marvel Rivals...

2767
02:35:14,220 --> 02:35:15,700
And not expect a...

2768
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:16,280
A who?

2769
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:21,880
Oh, from Fantastic Four.

2770
02:35:24,980 --> 02:35:25,540
Uh...

2771
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:26,620
I got my hopes up.

2772
02:35:27,100 --> 02:35:27,840
I thought there was actually...

2773
02:35:28,620 --> 02:35:30,200
I thought there was actually...

2774
02:35:30,200 --> 02:35:31,540
Something good in...

2775
02:35:31,540 --> 02:35:35,360
I thought...

2776
02:35:35,360 --> 02:35:37,680
I thought there was actually...

2777
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:38,060
Peak.

2778
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:39,460
Nevermind.

2779
02:35:42,180 --> 02:35:43,900
John Carpenter is the thing?

2780
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:44,640
Yeah.

2781
02:35:45,940 --> 02:35:47,520
Oh, there is some...

2782
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:48,460
Glow squids down there.

2783
02:35:48,540 --> 02:35:50,760
Wow, this is like the most vast ocean ever.

2784
02:35:50,760 --> 02:35:50,940
We are...

2785
02:35:52,040 --> 02:35:54,520
We are so lost.

2786
02:35:57,020 --> 02:35:58,240
Such a hater.

2787
02:35:59,180 --> 02:36:01,840
No, I just really don't know anything about Marvel.

2788
02:36:03,360 --> 02:36:04,040
Or...

2789
02:36:04,040 --> 02:36:05,600
Comic book stuff in general.

2790
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:09,620
I'm an anime nerd.

2791
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:12,180
It's like, you know...

2792
02:36:12,180 --> 02:36:14,080
The comic book nerds...

2793
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:16,520
Would always look down on the anime nerds.

2794
02:36:16,900 --> 02:36:18,940
So it's just instilled in my...

2795
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:20,940
You know, in my soul to be like...

2796
02:36:24,600 --> 02:36:26,460
Comic books suck.

2797
02:36:30,540 --> 02:36:32,520
We are still in the desert, baby!

2798
02:36:33,160 --> 02:36:34,880
Wait, did I...

2799
02:36:35,820 --> 02:36:37,740
Wait, did I accidentally turn around?

2800
02:36:40,600 --> 02:36:42,200
When I circled around?

2801
02:36:44,540 --> 02:36:46,640
Did I accidentally turn around?

2802
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:46,760
No?

2803
02:36:51,020 --> 02:36:51,720
Wait...

2804
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:54,000
Hold on, let's go see if our...

2805
02:36:54,410 --> 02:36:56,520
If our safety island is still there.

2806
02:36:59,810 --> 02:37:00,470
Wait!

2807
02:37:02,410 --> 02:37:03,850
Look, a ruined portal!

2808
02:37:04,530 --> 02:37:05,850
I don't think that was there before.

2809
02:37:11,150 --> 02:37:11,850
No!

2810
02:37:12,410 --> 02:37:13,730
You are...

2811
02:37:13,730 --> 02:37:15,610
You are... You suck.

2812
02:37:15,610 --> 02:37:16,870
I don't need the lodestone.

2813
02:37:17,250 --> 02:37:18,070
Golden apple!

2814
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:29,600
Okay.

2815
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:32,800
No,

2816
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:38,200
this looks different.

2817
02:37:49,450 --> 02:37:52,190
I just bought a comic book while listening to you.

2818
02:37:58,600 --> 02:38:01,140
It was the opposite when I was in school.

2819
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:08,140
The anime and manga kids thought comic books and western graphic novels weren't sophisticated enough for their ultra-culture taste.

2820
02:38:09,500 --> 02:38:10,760
Nerds are so funny.

2821
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:14,500
I'm a better nerd than you.

2822
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:19,000
My nerd tastes are better than your nerd tastes.

2823
02:38:19,120 --> 02:38:21,760
You know who doesn't care and just...

2824
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:24,300
Is so chill and like, you know...

2825
02:38:25,220 --> 02:38:27,380
I need to make a feather duster.

2826
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:30,580
Anyway, you know who doesn't care about anything like that?

2827
02:38:30,580 --> 02:38:32,120
Train otaku.

2828
02:38:34,140 --> 02:38:36,580
People who just like trains...

2829
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:39,120
Are so joyous.

2830
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:42,100
And so...

2831
02:38:42,100 --> 02:38:43,800
They just...

2832
02:38:43,800 --> 02:38:46,540
They're so...

2833
02:38:46,540 --> 02:38:47,660
They just...

2834
02:38:47,660 --> 02:38:48,920
They stay in their lane.

2835
02:38:49,720 --> 02:38:51,020
They stay in their train.

2836
02:38:52,340 --> 02:38:53,740
They stay on their track.

2837
02:38:56,120 --> 02:38:58,680
Made me Damon in the Odyssey.

2838
02:39:01,780 --> 02:39:03,080
They are wholesome.

2839
02:39:03,340 --> 02:39:04,320
Yeah, they're wholesome.

2840
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:06,220
And they're like, I just...

2841
02:39:06,220 --> 02:39:07,160
I like trains.

2842
02:39:07,980 --> 02:39:09,960
If you want to know about trains...

2843
02:39:09,960 --> 02:39:10,760
I'll tell you.

2844
02:39:11,020 --> 02:39:11,400
See?

2845
02:39:11,640 --> 02:39:12,880
I didn't turn around again.

2846
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:14,640
I think the biome is just this huge.

2847
02:39:16,340 --> 02:39:17,640
Hazel, welcome to membership.

2848
02:39:17,820 --> 02:39:18,660
Thank you.

2849
02:39:19,380 --> 02:39:21,220
Wait, so did I turn around this time?

2850
02:39:23,860 --> 02:39:24,380
No.

2851
02:39:25,180 --> 02:39:26,720
We're continuing onward.

2852
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:27,820
I think.

2853
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,300
The train and plane otaku are at war?

2854
02:39:32,420 --> 02:39:33,160
Girl, what?

2855
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:35,320
No, they're not.

2856
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:38,200
Don't tell me that.

2857
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:39,660
They're not at war.

2858
02:39:41,440 --> 02:39:42,580
Why can't we coexist?

2859
02:39:45,020 --> 02:39:47,420
I don't know, humans gotta make everything a competition.

2860
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:49,640
Everything's a peepee contest.

2861
02:39:51,360 --> 02:39:53,380
Speaking of manga, have you read Strike It Rich?

2862
02:39:53,460 --> 02:39:54,280
I haven't.

2863
02:39:58,660 --> 02:40:01,920
I saw a video the other day...

2864
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:02,800
of a...

2865
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:07,400
I think I saved it.

2866
02:40:07,460 --> 02:40:08,260
I sure hope I did.

2867
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:10,100
Now I'm trying to think if I saved it or not.

2868
02:40:10,460 --> 02:40:14,440
But it's a place where you can go on little tiny trains.

2869
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:16,040
And like...

2870
02:40:16,040 --> 02:40:18,380
On the inside, they look like real trains.

2871
02:40:18,540 --> 02:40:19,700
And you can drive them.

2872
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:22,880
And I was like, maybe...

2873
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:24,700
when I go back...

2874
02:40:24,700 --> 02:40:26,140
to Japan, I can try that.

2875
02:40:30,990 --> 02:40:31,810
Here comes the sun.

2876
02:40:32,650 --> 02:40:34,850
Here comes the sun.

2877
02:40:34,990 --> 02:40:35,770
Wait.

2878
02:40:36,790 --> 02:40:37,810
Wait, I forgot.

2879
02:40:38,270 --> 02:40:39,290
The firefly bush.

2880
02:40:40,370 --> 02:40:42,390
Here comes the sun.

2881
02:40:42,570 --> 02:40:44,550
And I say...

2882
02:40:44,550 --> 02:40:45,610
It's alright.

2883
02:40:58,450 --> 02:41:00,270
So cute.

2884
02:41:01,110 --> 02:41:02,210
So pretty.

2885
02:41:03,670 --> 02:41:05,890
What I really wanna do...

2886
02:41:05,890 --> 02:41:07,990
is whenever I...

2887
02:41:07,990 --> 02:41:08,870
Whenever...

2888
02:41:13,910 --> 02:41:14,550
Bozo.

2889
02:41:14,970 --> 02:41:23,930
Whenever I can play on a server again with other people and feel motivation to build and, you know, actually play and have fun with friends...

2890
02:41:25,190 --> 02:41:26,010
I want to...

2891
02:41:26,930 --> 02:41:27,930
I want to...

2892
02:41:28,850 --> 02:41:38,030
have like a firefly lined path and then if you cover the area with like moss or something other things won't spawn.

2893
02:41:38,950 --> 02:41:42,770
I saw a video recently of a love hotel that had a train themed room.

2894
02:41:42,990 --> 02:41:44,470
I think that's kinda similar.

2895
02:41:45,190 --> 02:41:46,230
I don't think so.

2896
02:41:47,750 --> 02:41:53,330
Is it true that you can't go to a love hotel unless you... Like, what if I wanted to go to a love hotel by myself?

2897
02:41:55,050 --> 02:41:57,230
Would they not let me get my own room?

2898
02:41:58,450 --> 02:41:59,430
I'm just trying to sleep.

2899
02:42:03,630 --> 02:42:04,350
You can?

2900
02:42:04,570 --> 02:42:05,370
No way, really?

2901
02:42:05,370 --> 02:42:08,610
I thought I read once that you couldn't.

2902
02:42:09,990 --> 02:42:12,390
That you had to be like a couple.

2903
02:42:14,330 --> 02:42:15,050
You can!

2904
02:42:16,690 --> 02:42:17,590
Is it clean?

2905
02:42:19,050 --> 02:42:20,210
Depends on the hotel.

2906
02:42:21,850 --> 02:42:26,430
I guess they probably get a bunch of people for like the fun...

2907
02:42:27,250 --> 02:42:28,910
For the fun rooms, right?

2908
02:42:29,170 --> 02:42:31,450
Well, I mean, they're all supposed to be fun.

2909
02:42:31,750 --> 02:42:33,670
But you know, like the themed rooms.

2910
02:42:45,370 --> 02:42:48,570
I probably wouldn't lay under the sheet.

2911
02:42:59,340 --> 02:43:01,020
An escape room?

2912
02:43:01,480 --> 02:43:03,420
Oh my gosh, an escape room love hotel?

2913
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:05,180
Would be awesome.

2914
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:09,040
But I've never done an escape room before.

2915
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:10,180
Actually, I might panic.

2916
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:14,480
I might bring a tent.

2917
02:43:19,300 --> 02:43:20,920
Sounds like a doujin plot.

2918
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:21,640
It does.

2919
02:43:22,140 --> 02:43:23,560
I'm gonna tell Ayami mama.

2920
02:43:24,240 --> 02:43:24,840
Mama!

2921
02:43:25,860 --> 02:43:28,060
I have inspiration for you.

2922
02:43:31,360 --> 02:43:33,760
Are we gonna find another creaking?

2923
02:43:51,230 --> 02:43:52,230
Village doko?

2924
02:43:52,350 --> 02:43:55,590
I think this is the longest I've been without ever finding a village.

2925
02:43:56,870 --> 02:43:57,750
Like in a game.

2926
02:43:58,110 --> 02:44:00,890
We've found every biome that I've been looking for.

2927
02:44:01,650 --> 02:44:02,970
And never found the village.

2928
02:44:04,670 --> 02:44:06,470
Wow, this is a tiny island.

2929
02:44:09,150 --> 02:44:11,770
How much you wanna bet something epic is under here?

2930
02:44:12,530 --> 02:44:13,590
Something huge.

2931
02:44:14,010 --> 02:44:16,590
How much you wanna bet the stronghold is under this island?

2932
02:44:19,350 --> 02:44:21,130
Under this tiny island.

2933
02:44:23,450 --> 02:44:24,890
There's a stronghold or something.

2934
02:44:26,410 --> 02:44:27,350
Shall we dig here?

2935
02:44:29,450 --> 02:44:30,510
Shall we dig?

2936
02:44:30,710 --> 02:44:31,290
One dollar.

2937
02:44:34,930 --> 02:44:36,290
Just found Sicily.

2938
02:44:36,290 --> 02:44:39,170
If you see a giant cyclops, say your name is nobody.

2939
02:44:40,770 --> 02:44:42,250
Let's dig straight down.

2940
02:44:42,990 --> 02:44:45,310
Let's dig straight down, baby.

2941
02:44:46,230 --> 02:44:46,670
Hold on.

2942
02:44:46,750 --> 02:44:48,570
Before we do that though, let's collect some wood.

2943
02:44:52,560 --> 02:44:53,440
Two dollar.

2944
02:44:54,180 --> 02:44:54,900
Tree fruity.

2945
02:44:57,800 --> 02:45:01,960
This is such a small little biome.

2946
02:45:03,340 --> 02:45:03,820
Biome.

2947
02:45:03,820 --> 02:45:03,880
Biome.

2948
02:45:05,480 --> 02:45:07,440
I guess if you wanted...

2949
02:45:08,300 --> 02:45:09,820
I guess if you wanted some...

2950
02:45:12,300 --> 02:45:13,160
What's the word?

2951
02:45:14,960 --> 02:45:16,100
Is that a creeper?

2952
02:45:16,740 --> 02:45:17,240
Right there?

2953
02:45:21,010 --> 02:45:25,530
I've been watching a lot of Minecraft creepypasta videos.

2954
02:45:26,230 --> 02:45:27,070
It is!

2955
02:45:27,150 --> 02:45:28,230
Oh my gosh, it's a creeper.

2956
02:45:31,530 --> 02:45:33,290
And they'll be like...

2957
02:45:33,290 --> 02:45:38,930
They'll be like, if you see this in your world, delete it right now.

2958
02:45:40,450 --> 02:45:42,410
I watch them when I go to sleep.

2959
02:45:43,870 --> 02:45:45,290
It'll be like...

2960
02:45:45,890 --> 02:45:47,450
If you...

2961
02:45:47,450 --> 02:45:49,290
If you...

2962
02:45:50,310 --> 02:45:52,970
see this, delete your world.

2963
02:45:53,730 --> 02:45:55,090
And it'll be like a...

2964
02:45:55,090 --> 02:46:00,010
It'll be like a really obscure mob or something stupid.

2965
02:46:00,010 --> 02:46:02,510
If you see this.

2966
02:46:03,610 --> 02:46:04,990
Turns out it was Larry.

2967
02:46:08,670 --> 02:46:09,790
Evil Larry.

2968
02:46:19,770 --> 02:46:20,330
Okay.

2969
02:46:21,870 --> 02:46:24,270
I think we should even dig right here, actually.

2970
02:46:28,590 --> 02:46:30,130
Do we need horse armor?

2971
02:46:30,770 --> 02:46:33,950
I thought maybe we might find a horse eventually, but I don't think we do.

2972
02:46:34,910 --> 02:46:36,110
We don't need books.

2973
02:46:36,310 --> 02:46:37,370
I'm not reading today.

2974
02:46:37,370 --> 02:46:40,370
We don't need a glistening melon slice.

2975
02:46:40,770 --> 02:46:42,210
I'll bring the potion of water.

2976
02:46:44,090 --> 02:46:45,610
I don't have a ton of food.

2977
02:46:46,310 --> 02:46:47,870
Oh wait, I never cooked my potato.

2978
02:46:50,070 --> 02:46:53,090
But honestly, this isn't for...

2979
02:46:53,090 --> 02:46:54,350
We're not living here, you know.

2980
02:46:56,570 --> 02:46:58,330
We'll probably die in here.

2981
02:46:59,470 --> 02:47:00,070
Truthfully.

2982
02:47:00,890 --> 02:47:01,910
Quite honestly.

2983
02:47:02,490 --> 02:47:04,010
We'll probably die in here.

2984
02:47:04,010 --> 02:47:05,250
And that's okay.

2985
02:47:06,030 --> 02:47:08,190
What am I keep picking up?

2986
02:47:09,910 --> 02:47:10,090
Oh.

2987
02:47:10,670 --> 02:47:11,570
Okay.

2988
02:47:14,210 --> 02:47:15,110
Yep.

2989
02:47:17,030 --> 02:47:17,930
Let's...

2990
02:47:18,970 --> 02:47:19,870
Let's...

2991
02:47:21,070 --> 02:47:23,150
You can build a diamond sword.

2992
02:47:23,710 --> 02:47:24,310
I could.

2993
02:47:27,590 --> 02:47:31,510
Let's actually make an iron sword for now.

2994
02:47:32,490 --> 02:47:34,230
I got two furnaces.

2995
02:47:35,450 --> 02:47:36,890
Do I have any armor?

2996
02:47:37,150 --> 02:47:38,690
I'm mixing my worlds up.

2997
02:47:39,950 --> 02:47:43,190
I'm getting everything all mixed up from before.

2998
02:47:46,370 --> 02:47:47,790
We got a stone shovel.

2999
02:47:47,930 --> 02:47:49,150
We'll just go with that for now.

3000
02:47:50,230 --> 02:47:50,690
Here we go.

3001
02:47:56,090 --> 02:47:57,270
We're digging down.

3002
02:47:57,410 --> 02:47:58,190
Straight down.

3003
02:48:08,120 --> 02:48:09,460
I can't see anything.

3004
02:48:13,860 --> 02:48:14,440
Fearless.

3005
02:48:15,220 --> 02:48:16,280
That's not true.

3006
02:48:17,020 --> 02:48:18,140
I have a lot of fears.

3007
02:48:18,820 --> 02:48:20,200
But today...

3008
02:48:20,200 --> 02:48:23,660
I'm gonna face, gonna face, gonna face my fears.

3009
02:48:25,280 --> 02:48:27,040
Gonna face, gonna face.

3010
02:48:27,560 --> 02:48:29,560
I bet the stronghold is right under here.

3011
02:48:34,070 --> 02:48:36,750
We're gonna make a new pickaxe?

3012
02:48:38,950 --> 02:48:40,730
We're gonna make a new pickaxe?

3013
02:48:41,450 --> 02:48:42,330
Where is it?

3014
02:48:45,210 --> 02:48:45,710
Hmm?

3015
02:48:46,310 --> 02:48:47,110
Oh, there.

3016
02:48:49,410 --> 02:48:49,910
Nice.

3017
02:48:52,710 --> 02:48:53,530
Stay safe.

3018
02:48:53,570 --> 02:48:54,330
Have a great trip in Japan.

3019
02:48:54,610 --> 02:48:55,090
Thanks, Nan!

3020
02:48:56,690 --> 02:48:57,530
Thank you.

3021
02:49:00,330 --> 02:49:01,310
This is scary.

3022
02:49:01,450 --> 02:49:02,050
Don't be scared.

3023
02:49:04,030 --> 02:49:05,130
This is adventure.

3024
02:49:05,990 --> 02:49:07,830
This is what the game is all about.

3025
02:49:07,830 --> 02:49:07,890
Oh!

3026
02:49:11,010 --> 02:49:12,790
This is what it's all about, baby.

3027
02:49:14,770 --> 02:49:15,910
Did you know that?

3028
02:49:16,790 --> 02:49:17,470
I did.

3029
02:49:19,070 --> 02:49:20,130
I did know.

3030
02:49:21,750 --> 02:49:23,230
I don't even have a shield.

3031
02:49:23,610 --> 02:49:24,730
I just realized.

3032
02:49:26,490 --> 02:49:27,750
Maybe I should make one.

3033
02:49:30,810 --> 02:49:31,690
Hmm.

3034
02:49:37,430 --> 02:49:38,310
Flashba...

3035
02:49:38,310 --> 02:49:39,370
Biome.

3036
02:49:46,370 --> 02:49:47,830
It's so lit.

3037
02:49:48,730 --> 02:49:51,410
It's like, not lit, but you know, it's so bright.

3038
02:49:54,590 --> 02:49:56,370
And I fell in water.

3039
02:49:57,850 --> 02:49:58,850
Lucky us.

3040
02:49:59,950 --> 02:50:01,710
Any axolotls?

3041
02:50:02,670 --> 02:50:03,170
About?

3042
02:50:03,170 --> 02:50:04,830
Hot dog.

3043
02:50:04,850 --> 02:50:05,810
Hot dog, indeed.

3044
02:50:09,330 --> 02:50:10,770
It looks just like gold.

3045
02:50:14,450 --> 02:50:15,930
Try princess.

3046
02:50:16,150 --> 02:50:16,710
Thank you.

3047
02:50:17,630 --> 02:50:19,170
Should we keep going down?

3048
02:50:22,810 --> 02:50:23,550
Or...

3049
02:50:25,270 --> 02:50:26,890
That's kind of far down.

3050
02:50:29,610 --> 02:50:30,630
Oh boy.

3051
02:50:30,630 --> 02:50:30,730
Okay.

3052
02:50:32,450 --> 02:50:32,810
Oh.

3053
02:50:33,730 --> 02:50:35,330
That guy has an enchanted bow.

3054
02:50:36,130 --> 02:50:37,230
What do you need that for?

3055
02:50:38,270 --> 02:50:39,710
What do you need that for, huh?

3056
02:50:42,750 --> 02:50:43,150
Lava.

3057
02:50:45,710 --> 02:50:47,770
Guys, I don't think the stronghold is down here.

3058
02:50:51,690 --> 02:50:52,790
But we'll keep going.

3059
02:50:53,190 --> 02:50:54,050
Right through here.

3060
02:50:54,270 --> 02:50:54,950
How far are we?

3061
02:50:54,950 --> 02:50:56,130
Negative 15?

3062
02:50:57,070 --> 02:50:58,590
We're at like nothingness.

3063
02:51:01,510 --> 02:51:02,990
We're like at nothing.

3064
02:51:07,010 --> 02:51:09,490
She's never gonna come out of this cave anymore.

3065
02:51:11,350 --> 02:51:12,850
I'm gonna find a fossil!

3066
02:51:14,130 --> 02:51:14,770
I'm

3067
02:51:20,850 --> 02:51:22,250
finding a fossil, Chiara!

3068
02:51:35,230 --> 02:51:37,150
Gonna find lava at this rate?

3069
02:51:38,250 --> 02:51:38,630
Maybe.

3070
02:51:42,470 --> 02:51:43,930
Fine, I'll dig sideways.

3071
02:51:43,930 --> 02:51:46,890
Wait, not that way.

3072
02:51:46,970 --> 02:51:47,270
This way.

3073
02:51:54,470 --> 02:51:55,390
Here we go.

3074
02:52:02,070 --> 02:52:02,690
This is it.

3075
02:52:05,930 --> 02:52:06,850
This is it.

3076
02:52:07,770 --> 02:52:10,010
This is the adventure we yearned for.

3077
02:52:12,690 --> 02:52:13,630
We're at negative 42.

3078
02:52:13,730 --> 02:52:14,830
We'll definitely find diamonds.

3079
02:52:16,150 --> 02:52:16,710
Gold!

3080
02:52:17,230 --> 02:52:18,490
We struck gold!

3081
02:52:19,090 --> 02:52:23,830
If this were the gold rush, I would be a hot commodity.

3082
02:52:30,520 --> 02:52:31,600
We're rich!

3083
02:52:32,840 --> 02:52:34,360
Have you ever done one of those?

3084
02:52:36,340 --> 02:52:41,520
So, for those, I guess maybe it's kind of like... I don't know if it's an American thing or not.

3085
02:52:43,700 --> 02:52:48,320
There's places where you can get bags of dirt and sift for gold.

3086
02:52:50,600 --> 02:52:54,140
And, you know, you just do exactly that.

3087
02:52:54,280 --> 02:52:57,480
You just hope that you get gold.

3088
02:53:04,020 --> 02:53:04,900
Gold panning!

3089
02:53:04,980 --> 02:53:05,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3090
02:53:09,540 --> 02:53:12,940
They're usually... I don't think they're legit usually, but they're still fun.

3091
02:53:13,500 --> 02:53:14,280
The adventure...

3092
02:53:15,100 --> 02:53:15,620
Stop!

3093
02:53:17,260 --> 02:53:18,540
You're so on brand.

3094
02:53:18,640 --> 02:53:19,280
I love it.

3095
02:53:26,150 --> 02:53:29,850
Actually, I feel bad for telling her to find the fossil.

3096
02:53:30,010 --> 02:53:31,390
She'll be digging for years!

3097
02:53:32,430 --> 02:53:33,470
No, we'll get lucky!

3098
02:53:33,930 --> 02:53:35,050
We're going to strike it rich!

3099
02:53:38,570 --> 02:53:39,690
We're going to...

3100
02:53:40,230 --> 02:53:41,990
We're going to strike rich, right guys?

3101
02:53:42,950 --> 02:53:46,150
We're still alive in this hardcore world.

3102
02:53:47,010 --> 02:53:54,170
We lived through creepers and husks and drownings and everything.

3103
02:53:58,650 --> 02:54:02,510
And now we're going to find a diamond and...

3104
02:54:04,230 --> 02:54:05,990
Actually, I think we're about to find an exit.

3105
02:54:07,150 --> 02:54:07,950
Oh, there it is.

3106
02:54:12,110 --> 02:54:12,750
Shoot.

3107
02:54:12,750 --> 02:54:12,830
Shoot.

3108
02:54:15,530 --> 02:54:16,970
I don't...

3109
02:54:17,450 --> 02:54:19,110
I feel better in my hole.

3110
02:54:20,410 --> 02:54:21,750
Don't mine at night.

3111
02:54:22,170 --> 02:54:23,370
What is this creepypasta?

3112
02:54:27,940 --> 02:54:29,360
Is this a lush cave?

3113
02:54:29,400 --> 02:54:30,120
It is!

3114
02:54:30,760 --> 02:54:32,080
Yeah, it actually is.

3115
02:54:35,380 --> 02:54:36,240
Change direction?

3116
02:54:36,500 --> 02:54:36,720
OK.

3117
02:54:45,550 --> 02:54:48,290
I think it's mostly safe because...

3118
02:54:49,510 --> 02:54:51,390
Luckily this biome makes it...

3119
02:54:53,210 --> 02:54:54,490
safe to...

3120
02:54:54,490 --> 02:54:55,270
You know, safer.

3121
02:54:56,730 --> 02:54:57,790
What are we at?

3122
02:54:58,430 --> 02:54:59,190
Negative 51.

3123
02:55:00,030 --> 02:55:01,110
We're going to find diamond.

3124
02:55:01,810 --> 02:55:02,470
This way.

3125
02:55:08,370 --> 02:55:11,350
Yeah, the little branches make it...

3126
02:55:12,650 --> 02:55:13,910
lit up, you know?

3127
02:55:15,950 --> 02:55:18,910
Oh no, not a year long Minecraft series!

3128
02:55:20,370 --> 02:55:23,590
I'm going to mine out the entire world.

3129
02:55:25,270 --> 02:55:28,390
I'm going to make sure there's not even a single block left of Minecraft.

3130
02:55:31,970 --> 02:55:33,490
Time to dig diagonally.

3131
02:55:35,070 --> 02:55:35,550
Shall we?

3132
02:55:39,990 --> 02:55:42,710
I literally dug for a year and only found five.

3133
02:55:43,810 --> 02:55:45,770
I've... I mean, I've played...

3134
02:55:46,890 --> 02:55:48,030
Wait, they're a little loud.

3135
02:55:48,110 --> 02:55:49,870
I've played so much Minecraft!

3136
02:55:50,730 --> 02:55:53,830
I never knew you could find a fossil.

3137
02:55:54,730 --> 02:55:56,510
Wait, did I leave my stuff up there?

3138
02:56:00,050 --> 02:56:01,590
It's OK, I have more.

3139
02:56:02,290 --> 02:56:03,150
I have another furnace.

3140
02:56:03,890 --> 02:56:04,130
Wait!

3141
02:56:05,630 --> 02:56:06,810
My coal!

3142
02:56:10,550 --> 02:56:11,890
Wait, I messed up!

3143
02:56:29,500 --> 02:56:30,140
Safe.

3144
02:56:34,140 --> 02:56:34,780
Safe.

3145
02:56:36,700 --> 02:56:37,340
Safe.

3146
02:56:37,340 --> 02:56:37,780
Safe.

3147
02:56:39,340 --> 02:56:40,340
Saved, yeah.

3148
02:56:41,280 --> 02:56:42,740
All five of them.

3149
02:56:42,920 --> 02:56:47,960
Are you saying that even five coal isn't important?

3150
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:49,800
Everybody is important.

3151
02:56:51,440 --> 02:56:51,600
OK.

3152
02:56:52,160 --> 02:56:52,360
Oops.

3153
02:56:52,620 --> 02:56:52,760
OK.

3154
02:56:52,980 --> 02:56:53,280
We're good.

3155
02:56:54,500 --> 02:56:55,480
Diagonal time.

3156
02:56:58,160 --> 02:57:02,080
I wish this block though wasn't so difficult to cut through.

3157
02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:08,380
Every five coal is important.

3158
02:57:10,700 --> 02:57:13,040
Coal is quite rare in this game.

3159
02:57:13,640 --> 02:57:15,380
You're being sarcastic, huh?

3160
02:57:15,960 --> 02:57:18,200
But it is actually kind of rare at this level.

3161
02:57:19,400 --> 02:57:21,260
You can't... You can't doubt that.

3162
02:57:23,020 --> 02:57:23,300
OK.

3163
02:57:25,560 --> 02:57:30,280
It is actually quite rare at this depth.

3164
02:57:30,840 --> 02:57:31,460
OK.

3165
02:57:37,210 --> 02:57:42,010
I never even knew about fossils until Kiara found one.

3166
02:57:43,790 --> 02:57:45,570
What was her... What was her...

3167
02:57:46,090 --> 02:57:49,130
What was her Y level when she found it?

3168
02:57:49,710 --> 02:57:50,610
I need to know.

3169
02:57:51,050 --> 02:57:52,310
Am I at the correct depth?

3170
02:57:54,150 --> 02:57:55,430
I mean, if there's no fossils...

3171
02:57:56,010 --> 02:57:57,830
I mean, if there's no coal, how would there be fossils?

3172
02:58:01,600 --> 02:58:05,000
I could be wrong, but don't fossils only spawn in some biomes?

3173
02:58:09,190 --> 02:58:10,950
It's a wide range of Y levels.

3174
02:58:11,090 --> 02:58:11,230
OK.

3175
02:58:19,900 --> 02:58:21,500
Yes, only deserts and swamps.

3176
02:58:29,760 --> 02:58:33,160
You mean the biome that I started at?

3177
02:58:34,080 --> 02:58:38,920
You mean the biome that I was literally trapped in for like two hours?

3178
02:58:39,740 --> 02:58:40,920
You mean that biome?

3179
02:58:41,080 --> 02:58:46,820
You mean the biome I just left before deciding that we were going to go find a fossil?

3180
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:51,660
You mean the biome that I have to turn around...

3181
02:58:51,660 --> 02:58:55,180
You mean the biome that I literally traveled oceans across?

3182
02:59:00,370 --> 02:59:01,710
Oceans away from?

3183
02:59:02,570 --> 02:59:03,570
In fact?

3184
02:59:17,630 --> 02:59:18,610
I see.

3185
02:59:20,290 --> 02:59:21,710
I see, I see.

3186
02:59:22,930 --> 02:59:25,170
I see, I see, I see.

3187
02:59:26,330 --> 02:59:26,930
Yep, yep.

3188
02:59:27,450 --> 02:59:27,750
Cool.

3189
02:59:29,310 --> 02:59:30,490
Very cool.

3190
02:59:32,050 --> 02:59:32,970
Hold on.

3191
02:59:33,710 --> 02:59:34,970
I'm not throwing that away, obviously.

3192
02:59:35,550 --> 02:59:37,230
I'm just eating some rabbit.

3193
02:59:38,330 --> 02:59:40,230
Guys, I think we might actually like...

3194
02:59:41,610 --> 02:59:43,290
die of starvation in here, maybe.

3195
02:59:44,530 --> 02:59:45,750
Just dig to our spawn.

3196
02:59:48,190 --> 02:59:49,570
Imagine I die.

3197
02:59:49,730 --> 02:59:50,270
OK, hold on.

3198
02:59:50,730 --> 02:59:52,050
Go into spectator mode.

3199
02:59:52,650 --> 02:59:57,590
And what if there was a fossil close to where I spawned at?

3200
02:59:57,810 --> 03:00:00,090
Would that not be so incredible?

3201
03:00:00,590 --> 03:00:03,350
I think we're also about to find an exit right here.

3202
03:00:03,430 --> 03:00:05,930
How deep

3203
03:00:21,210 --> 03:00:22,010
is this biome?

3204
03:00:28,730 --> 03:00:31,530
Why have I not found any diamonds yet?

3205
03:00:33,790 --> 03:00:34,870
What is this?

3206
03:00:35,250 --> 03:00:35,930
What is this?

3207
03:00:37,070 --> 03:00:39,890
You guys, diamonds in 3...

3208
03:00:40,990 --> 03:00:41,670
2...

3209
03:00:42,370 --> 03:00:43,050
1...

3210
03:00:43,050 --> 03:00:43,890
And...

3211
03:00:43,890 --> 03:00:44,490
Diamond here!

3212
03:00:45,070 --> 03:00:45,470
Here!

3213
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:50,280
What's the Y level?

3214
03:00:50,380 --> 03:00:51,500
We're at negative 52.

3215
03:00:54,060 --> 03:00:55,180
We're at negative 52.

3216
03:00:59,570 --> 03:01:00,810
Must be a delay.

3217
03:01:00,810 --> 03:01:02,310
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3218
03:01:02,850 --> 03:01:08,810
I said to the person definitely not running this Minecraft server...

3219
03:01:13,190 --> 03:01:13,830
Diamonds...

3220
03:01:15,810 --> 03:01:16,450
in...

3221
03:01:16,450 --> 03:01:18,170
Wait, we're in the tough world.

3222
03:01:19,430 --> 03:01:21,210
Literally, the game just said tough.

3223
03:01:21,810 --> 03:01:25,970
I said, please, please, can I have diamonds, please?

3224
03:01:26,670 --> 03:01:28,650
And the game literally said, tough.

3225
03:01:30,810 --> 03:01:32,830
Oh, we just hit bedrock.

3226
03:01:35,110 --> 03:01:36,510
Yeah, tough luck.

3227
03:01:37,170 --> 03:01:37,710
Oops, sorry.

3228
03:01:50,660 --> 03:01:53,220
Please, please, can I have diamonds, please?

3229
03:01:59,040 --> 03:02:01,080
Can diamonds even spawn...

3230
03:02:01,080 --> 03:02:02,280
Oh, this low.

3231
03:02:06,350 --> 03:02:07,310
I guess so.

3232
03:02:08,610 --> 03:02:08,930
Uh-oh.

3233
03:02:12,730 --> 03:02:13,890
You guys hear that?

3234
03:02:15,350 --> 03:02:16,430
Must be nothing.

3235
03:02:17,270 --> 03:02:18,010
Just the wind.

3236
03:02:19,730 --> 03:02:20,370
Probably.

3237
03:02:28,930 --> 03:02:30,310
But if I...

3238
03:02:31,010 --> 03:02:35,010
If I go upwards, there might be diamonds by the lava.

3239
03:02:38,390 --> 03:02:39,030
Right?

3240
03:02:41,670 --> 03:02:42,630
Probably nothing.

3241
03:02:44,790 --> 03:02:46,270
It's nothing, no biggie.

3242
03:02:48,150 --> 03:02:48,790
Nice.

3243
03:02:49,350 --> 03:02:49,870
How would level...

3244
03:02:49,870 --> 03:02:50,870
I'm only level 10?

3245
03:02:59,630 --> 03:03:01,570
Don't be stressed.

3246
03:03:02,250 --> 03:03:03,110
Don't be stressed.

3247
03:03:03,210 --> 03:03:04,010
Don't be stressed.

3248
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:10,100
Sounds like a plan.

3249
03:03:11,400 --> 03:03:12,240
Iron.

3250
03:03:14,220 --> 03:03:15,380
It's kind of big, actually.

3251
03:03:18,300 --> 03:03:19,020
No.

3252
03:03:19,720 --> 03:03:19,960
No.

3253
03:03:20,560 --> 03:03:20,780
No.

3254
03:03:23,040 --> 03:03:24,140
My apple.

3255
03:03:24,760 --> 03:03:25,180
There we go.

3256
03:03:26,320 --> 03:03:27,520
Sounds awfully close.

3257
03:03:33,440 --> 03:03:34,120
Okay.

3258
03:03:38,330 --> 03:03:39,170
Alright.

3259
03:03:39,170 --> 03:03:40,870
Lava pops.

3260
03:03:41,910 --> 03:03:45,650
You're worth more than any diamond I mine.

3261
03:03:48,330 --> 03:03:50,530
What, are you gonna sell me off or something?

3262
03:04:21,390 --> 03:04:22,970
We found the lava pit.

3263
03:04:23,070 --> 03:04:23,970
Indeed we did.

3264
03:04:27,510 --> 03:04:29,750
And we found a mineshaft.

3265
03:04:32,090 --> 03:04:33,370
Did we find diamonds?

3266
03:04:45,730 --> 03:04:46,330
Oh god.

3267
03:04:46,610 --> 03:04:47,350
No, no, no.

3268
03:04:47,470 --> 03:04:47,750
Please.

3269
03:04:48,010 --> 03:04:49,090
I don't have a water bucket.

3270
03:04:49,670 --> 03:04:50,090
Oh my god.

3271
03:04:50,190 --> 03:04:51,090
Wait, there's water right here.

3272
03:04:52,130 --> 03:04:53,690
Water, water, water, water!

3273
03:05:07,950 --> 03:05:10,890
As long as the skelly doesn't come out from behind that...

3274
03:05:10,890 --> 03:05:12,570
From behind that area.

3275
03:05:13,270 --> 03:05:14,010
We'll be safe.

3276
03:05:14,130 --> 03:05:14,330
Okay.

3277
03:05:16,170 --> 03:05:16,930
No.

3278
03:05:21,450 --> 03:05:25,250
I thought there was diamond up there, but it's...

3279
03:05:25,250 --> 03:05:26,110
Lapis.

3280
03:05:35,420 --> 03:05:36,680
We're okay.

3281
03:05:37,320 --> 03:05:38,120
We're okay.

3282
03:05:38,360 --> 03:05:38,840
We're okay.

3283
03:05:43,910 --> 03:05:45,330
We're okay.

3284
03:05:45,630 --> 03:05:46,250
We're okay.

3285
03:05:47,230 --> 03:05:49,910
In fact, I'm gonna do a little bit of...

3286
03:05:50,530 --> 03:05:51,290
This.

3287
03:05:52,390 --> 03:05:52,750
That.

3288
03:05:54,310 --> 03:05:54,750
Goodbye.

3289
03:05:55,750 --> 03:05:57,490
There we go.

3290
03:05:58,270 --> 03:05:59,670
There we go, yeah.

3291
03:06:00,470 --> 03:06:01,070
Safety.

3292
03:06:01,690 --> 03:06:02,350
Safety.

3293
03:06:05,920 --> 03:06:07,680
Oh, I hear a spitter.

3294
03:06:09,140 --> 03:06:11,640
I don't really wanna go into the mineshaft.

3295
03:06:12,270 --> 03:06:13,760
Oh my god!

3296
03:06:31,110 --> 03:06:33,360
She survived and she gets diamonds.

3297
03:06:33,500 --> 03:06:35,480
I think I earned that!

3298
03:06:35,980 --> 03:06:41,250
I earned those diamonds.

3299
03:06:41,250 --> 03:06:43,990
I earned that, baby!

3300
03:06:52,280 --> 03:06:54,480
Oh my goodness.

3301
03:07:01,360 --> 03:07:02,000
Yurian!

3302
03:07:02,580 --> 03:07:03,460
Thank you for the diamond.

3303
03:07:04,200 --> 03:07:05,340
Alright, now let's go die.

3304
03:07:09,230 --> 03:07:10,670
We're gonna die, everybody.

3305
03:07:10,930 --> 03:07:11,190
Okay?

3306
03:07:12,790 --> 03:07:13,870
We're gonna die.

3307
03:07:13,930 --> 03:07:14,890
I'm done with this world.

3308
03:07:17,070 --> 03:07:18,190
It's time to die.

3309
03:07:23,670 --> 03:07:27,690
It's not a respectable death, but...

3310
03:07:27,690 --> 03:07:30,430
Can we walk into the lava like Terminator?

3311
03:07:34,130 --> 03:07:39,530
I guess we can do that instead.

3312
03:07:45,460 --> 03:07:47,340
Well, actually, I don't know where we are.

3313
03:07:50,900 --> 03:07:51,500
Live!

3314
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:54,840
I'm alive somehow.

3315
03:07:57,020 --> 03:07:58,600
Another death cheated.

3316
03:07:58,780 --> 03:08:00,020
How do we get out of here though?

3317
03:08:00,680 --> 03:08:02,280
I don't even know where the lava is.

3318
03:08:02,340 --> 03:08:03,460
Oh, the lava...

3319
03:08:03,460 --> 03:08:04,580
Lava pops.

3320
03:08:04,900 --> 03:08:05,420
This side.

3321
03:08:07,940 --> 03:08:09,020
Wawa said live.

3322
03:08:09,900 --> 03:08:11,700
I think she said live.

3323
03:08:12,060 --> 03:08:13,020
Like, I'm alive!

3324
03:08:13,020 --> 03:08:13,280
Live!

3325
03:08:14,120 --> 03:08:14,680
Or...

3326
03:08:14,680 --> 03:08:16,740
The live stream is live, right?

3327
03:08:18,600 --> 03:08:19,420
Oh, I do have a shovel.

3328
03:08:19,520 --> 03:08:20,040
You're so right.

3329
03:08:24,680 --> 03:08:27,540
Oh my gosh, I almost really got...

3330
03:08:29,520 --> 03:08:30,640
Like, mega...

3331
03:08:30,640 --> 03:08:32,680
How do we get out of here?

3332
03:08:35,500 --> 03:08:36,940
No, don't die!

3333
03:08:38,140 --> 03:08:40,180
Kiwawa, I'm done with this world.

3334
03:08:41,160 --> 03:08:42,000
I'm done.

3335
03:08:42,880 --> 03:08:43,580
It's okay.

3336
03:08:43,580 --> 03:08:45,580
I can always make another...

3337
03:08:46,920 --> 03:08:47,520
Another...

3338
03:08:47,520 --> 03:08:49,920
Another hardcore world.

3339
03:08:50,620 --> 03:08:51,800
Actually, I wanted to...

3340
03:08:51,800 --> 03:08:52,960
Oh, I found it.

3341
03:08:54,320 --> 03:08:56,360
Oh my gosh, I finally found our way out.

3342
03:09:02,150 --> 03:09:03,510
It's okay, Kiwawa.

3343
03:09:04,270 --> 03:09:05,310
I'll be back.

3344
03:09:19,870 --> 03:09:21,350
Da-dun-dun-da-dun.

3345
03:09:21,970 --> 03:09:22,610
Oh!

3346
03:09:23,410 --> 03:09:28,530
My stuff even...

3347
03:09:28,530 --> 03:09:29,210
Yay!

3348
03:09:29,690 --> 03:09:30,990
Where it all began.

3349
03:09:31,690 --> 03:09:32,350
Wait, hold on.

3350
03:09:34,650 --> 03:09:35,510
Copy.

3351
03:09:38,430 --> 03:09:39,290
Paste.

3352
03:09:40,850 --> 03:09:42,570
Da-dun-dun-da-dun.

3353
03:09:45,230 --> 03:09:46,090
Paste.

3354
03:09:49,770 --> 03:09:50,510
Oh, wait.

3355
03:09:50,850 --> 03:09:51,710
Single...

3356
03:09:51,710 --> 03:09:52,730
No, default.

3357
03:09:54,730 --> 03:09:55,190
Creative.

3358
03:09:56,630 --> 03:09:57,090
Create.

3359
03:09:58,430 --> 03:09:59,490
And then, hold on.

3360
03:10:01,470 --> 03:10:01,930
AppData.

3361
03:10:02,330 --> 03:10:03,910
I wanted to see...

3362
03:10:03,910 --> 03:10:05,390
Remember how I was just like...

3363
03:10:05,390 --> 03:10:05,670
Oh, wait.

3364
03:10:05,870 --> 03:10:06,610
What is it?

3365
03:10:08,290 --> 03:10:08,750
AppData.

3366
03:10:09,670 --> 03:10:12,890
Remember how I was just like, oh, I want to see what's around.

3367
03:10:14,070 --> 03:10:16,010
I'm looking at my screenshots.

3368
03:10:16,010 --> 03:10:16,270
Screenshots.

3369
03:10:20,630 --> 03:10:21,710
Teleport.

3370
03:10:24,010 --> 03:10:25,530
Teleport me.

3371
03:10:26,630 --> 03:10:27,210
Two.

3372
03:10:30,970 --> 03:10:32,030
Minus 44.

3373
03:10:33,510 --> 03:10:34,070
240.

3374
03:10:35,690 --> 03:10:36,770
Alright.

3375
03:10:41,810 --> 03:10:44,750
I was like, there's going to be something big down here.

3376
03:10:45,650 --> 03:10:47,250
There's going to be something big.

3377
03:10:49,010 --> 03:10:49,270
Remember?

3378
03:11:03,740 --> 03:11:04,220
Wait.

3379
03:11:16,050 --> 03:11:16,970
No, wait.

3380
03:11:17,070 --> 03:11:17,430
Hold on.

3381
03:11:17,590 --> 03:11:19,330
Let's see if we can find the...

3382
03:11:19,330 --> 03:11:20,370
The island!

3383
03:11:35,430 --> 03:11:38,670
If I had dug... I dug, I think, this way.

3384
03:11:38,910 --> 03:11:40,370
If I had dug that way.

3385
03:11:42,210 --> 03:11:43,830
I fell through here, remember?

3386
03:11:44,090 --> 03:11:44,850
I fell through here.

3387
03:11:44,930 --> 03:11:46,150
We saw these gold blocks.

3388
03:11:46,150 --> 03:11:48,250
And then I went this way.

3389
03:11:49,450 --> 03:11:54,150
If I had... If I had gone this way...

3390
03:11:55,510 --> 03:11:57,470
Actually, I would have been stuck in water.

3391
03:11:58,430 --> 03:11:59,210
Oh, actually, ok.

3392
03:11:59,550 --> 03:12:00,750
No, it was kind of diagonal.

3393
03:12:02,130 --> 03:12:04,310
It still would have been a bit of a trek to get to.

3394
03:12:05,250 --> 03:12:06,410
I was close though.

3395
03:12:06,850 --> 03:12:07,810
I knew.

3396
03:12:08,630 --> 03:12:11,890
I knew there was something big down here.

3397
03:12:12,870 --> 03:12:13,910
I knew.

3398
03:12:14,580 --> 03:12:16,330
The diagonal guy was right!

3399
03:12:20,620 --> 03:12:21,360
VTuber!

3400
03:12:22,540 --> 03:12:24,360
Dig diagonally, VTuber!

3401
03:12:27,390 --> 03:12:29,120
I was a fool for not listening.

3402
03:12:29,760 --> 03:12:30,540
And I apologize.

3403
03:12:31,480 --> 03:12:33,940
I deeply regret my words and my actions.

3404
03:12:37,680 --> 03:12:38,780
Dang it.

3405
03:12:39,360 --> 03:12:42,400
I mean, I probably would have been freaking...

3406
03:12:42,400 --> 03:12:43,960
But look at this!

3407
03:12:44,500 --> 03:12:46,800
It's a trial with the...

3408
03:12:46,800 --> 03:12:54,340
The lush branches and stuff.

3409
03:12:54,420 --> 03:12:55,280
It's so pretty.

3410
03:12:57,160 --> 03:12:58,340
It's so pretty.

3411
03:12:59,500 --> 03:13:00,740
Well guys, this was fun.

3412
03:13:01,500 --> 03:13:05,580
Thank you for allowing me to play some Minecraft.

3413
03:13:06,020 --> 03:13:08,580
I was just in a Minecraft mood.

3414
03:13:08,580 --> 03:13:10,880
And somehow...

3415
03:13:12,500 --> 03:13:17,300
Somehow we saw everything that I wanted to show off.

3416
03:13:17,800 --> 03:13:18,480
Somehow.

3417
03:13:20,160 --> 03:13:23,560
Literally, so easily, in fact.

3418
03:13:24,400 --> 03:13:28,060
Too easily that I just kind of wandered around.

3419
03:13:28,920 --> 03:13:29,600
Doing nothing.

3420
03:13:30,740 --> 03:13:32,640
For some time.

3421
03:13:34,340 --> 03:13:37,220
Because I didn't know what to do.

3422
03:13:41,220 --> 03:13:42,700
Thanks for the stream, Minto!

3423
03:13:43,380 --> 03:13:44,800
Cool to see the new stuff in Minecraft.

3424
03:13:45,320 --> 03:13:48,680
Also, thanks for all the neuron activations you gave me whenever you mentioned Firefly.

3425
03:13:49,340 --> 03:13:50,660
Oh yeah, that's your girl, right?

3426
03:13:55,840 --> 03:13:57,180
What's... Is it Honkai?

3427
03:13:59,760 --> 03:14:00,160
Blonkai.

3428
03:14:00,160 --> 03:14:00,240
Okay,

3429
03:14:11,270 --> 03:14:13,790
I have another objective before we end the stream.

3430
03:14:14,390 --> 03:14:16,390
So basically, I'm going to set this place ablaze.

3431
03:14:17,450 --> 03:14:17,970
Right?

3432
03:14:19,310 --> 03:14:21,090
Basically, I'm flattening this land.

3433
03:14:22,050 --> 03:14:26,070
And then, I'm going to cover it in Firefly's bushes.

3434
03:14:26,390 --> 03:14:27,470
Yeah, hot dog.

3435
03:14:27,890 --> 03:14:35,110
And then, we're going to have a beautiful Firefly display when it comes to night time.

3436
03:14:35,150 --> 03:14:35,990
And I'll see you guys off.

3437
03:14:39,090 --> 03:14:41,690
I cannot set the mushrooms ablaze.

3438
03:14:42,170 --> 03:14:42,710
Unfortunately.

3439
03:14:49,780 --> 03:14:52,360
This is just the easiest way to flatten it, you know what I mean?

3440
03:14:55,850 --> 03:14:57,450
It's just the easiest way.

3441
03:14:57,830 --> 03:15:03,250
You know, if there was another easy way, I wouldn't have resorted to such violent measures.

3442
03:15:03,450 --> 03:15:05,110
But I just had to.

3443
03:15:09,990 --> 03:15:13,150
I just have to resort to such violent measures.

3444
03:15:14,210 --> 03:15:15,370
It's not my fault.

3445
03:15:15,470 --> 03:15:16,350
I don't want to do this.

3446
03:15:17,230 --> 03:15:21,570
It's not like I enjoy the pretty lights and everything.

3447
03:15:21,630 --> 03:15:22,270
What's not on fire?

3448
03:15:25,410 --> 03:15:26,610
Oh my gosh.

3449
03:15:28,130 --> 03:15:29,570
Burn it down, Minky.

3450
03:15:36,460 --> 03:15:38,080
I'm on fire myself.

3451
03:15:42,440 --> 03:15:43,660
No tree is spared.

3452
03:16:04,220 --> 03:16:06,160
Not enough spread yet.

3453
03:16:06,380 --> 03:16:06,900
Come on.

3454
03:16:07,740 --> 03:16:08,740
Come on, fire.

3455
03:16:09,500 --> 03:16:11,880
Aren't you supposed to be so fast and dangerous?

3456
03:16:12,520 --> 03:16:13,460
Oh my gosh, look at that.

3457
03:16:14,080 --> 03:16:15,160
It's really coming down now.

3458
03:16:15,220 --> 03:16:15,560
Okay, good.

3459
03:16:19,540 --> 03:16:20,700
Burn everything, baby.

3460
03:16:24,610 --> 03:16:25,390
Look at this.

3461
03:16:27,490 --> 03:16:29,850
Wow, it's kind of beautiful in its own way.

3462
03:16:33,730 --> 03:16:34,990
Stop her from cooking.

3463
03:16:34,990 --> 03:16:35,230
No!

3464
03:16:41,310 --> 03:16:44,470
If only we had a mushroom biome.

3465
03:17:33,080 --> 03:17:37,040
And look, the sun is going to be going down soonish.

3466
03:17:37,480 --> 03:17:40,040
The fires should be done by then.

3467
03:17:41,020 --> 03:17:42,820
And no more trees blocking the view.

3468
03:17:43,820 --> 03:17:44,400
Exactly.

3469
03:17:48,040 --> 03:17:48,880
Exactly.

3470
03:17:52,640 --> 03:17:55,100
I can't believe my luck today.

3471
03:17:56,920 --> 03:17:58,280
The universe is so funny.

3472
03:17:59,940 --> 03:18:06,140
The universe really likes to make me out to be a real clown.

3473
03:18:08,480 --> 03:18:14,580
We will have pure, unobstructed views of the fireflies.

3474
03:18:15,440 --> 03:18:17,680
Alright, now I can assist a little bit.

3475
03:18:18,240 --> 03:18:18,740
There we go.

3476
03:18:26,250 --> 03:18:28,270
Joker mint arc.

3477
03:18:30,790 --> 03:18:32,870
I've always been...

3478
03:18:32,870 --> 03:18:36,130
I've always been the Joker.

3479
03:18:36,950 --> 03:18:37,770
The Jonkler.

3480
03:18:44,350 --> 03:18:44,730
Okay.

3481
03:18:52,410 --> 03:18:56,310
Look at the fires desperately start trying to hold on.

3482
03:18:58,450 --> 03:19:00,850
Everything, everything will burn.

3483
03:19:02,550 --> 03:19:03,290
Okay.

3484
03:19:04,670 --> 03:19:07,450
It should be good.

3485
03:19:08,150 --> 03:19:09,350
I think.

3486
03:19:09,830 --> 03:19:12,030
Maybe I... I don't think I overdid it.

3487
03:19:12,950 --> 03:19:17,510
I was going to say maybe I overdid it a little bit, but no, it's okay.

3488
03:19:20,410 --> 03:19:23,310
It's fine, probably.

3489
03:19:25,050 --> 03:19:26,010
It's like...

3490
03:19:28,610 --> 03:19:30,010
It's like whatever.

3491
03:19:32,230 --> 03:19:32,970
Hi, Mint.

3492
03:19:33,070 --> 03:19:33,390
Hello.

3493
03:19:35,010 --> 03:19:35,990
Thanks for the superchat.

3494
03:19:36,050 --> 03:19:37,050
Thank you so much.

3495
03:19:37,770 --> 03:19:38,010
Thank you.

3496
03:19:38,050 --> 03:19:40,630
Are you planning on doing a real cover of Snake Eater at some point?

3497
03:19:43,610 --> 03:19:46,130
I just don't think I'm doing justice.

3498
03:19:48,710 --> 03:19:49,430
You know?

3499
03:19:57,050 --> 03:19:58,990
I like how the fire stacks.

3500
03:20:00,350 --> 03:20:01,070
Where's the sun?

3501
03:20:01,190 --> 03:20:02,570
Oh no, it's about to go down.

3502
03:20:03,450 --> 03:20:05,450
It's all about to go down.

3503
03:20:21,690 --> 03:20:22,470
Uh-oh, wait.

3504
03:20:22,690 --> 03:20:24,190
No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

3505
03:20:25,410 --> 03:20:26,670
My plan is backfiring.

3506
03:20:42,920 --> 03:20:44,260
I need more time.

3507
03:20:44,680 --> 03:20:45,660
Go away, fireflies.

3508
03:20:45,720 --> 03:20:46,120
Not yet.

3509
03:20:52,940 --> 03:20:54,940
I don't think I needed to do the whole...

3510
03:20:56,320 --> 03:21:00,120
You know, I'm starting to think I might have overreacted.

3511
03:21:03,500 --> 03:21:04,220
Backfiring.

3512
03:21:09,420 --> 03:21:10,820
Starting to think maybe...

3513
03:21:14,740 --> 03:21:18,660
Starting to think maybe I overreacted a little bit.

3514
03:21:28,260 --> 03:21:30,060
That, this was a bit excessive.

3515
03:21:30,300 --> 03:21:32,880
No, no, no, no.

3516
03:21:34,080 --> 03:21:34,360
No.

3517
03:21:37,240 --> 03:21:41,260
What is a life of luxury if not a bit of excess?

3518
03:21:42,160 --> 03:21:42,480
Right?

3519
03:21:50,480 --> 03:21:53,420
Just don't look in the direction of the burnt trees.

3520
03:22:02,300 --> 03:22:03,420
Thank you for stealing my condiments.

3521
03:22:03,620 --> 03:22:05,460
I love me some comfy block game stream.

3522
03:22:05,960 --> 03:22:06,840
Thank you.

3523
03:22:07,510 --> 03:22:10,040
I'm glad you liked it.

3524
03:22:15,740 --> 03:22:19,740
Again, I apologize for directionless gaming.

3525
03:22:21,160 --> 03:22:23,700
But somehow we really gamed today.

3526
03:22:24,040 --> 03:22:24,460
Somehow.

3527
03:22:25,700 --> 03:22:29,420
Somehow things ended up becoming really goofy.

3528
03:22:30,810 --> 03:22:35,380
In terms of how the game just was so goofy to me.

3529
03:22:41,180 --> 03:22:43,360
Maybe I should have come up with a backup plan.

3530
03:22:45,300 --> 03:22:53,340
Like, haha, this will be a Minecraft world that I will continue on with and try to actually play and see through it to the end.

3531
03:22:55,060 --> 03:22:56,880
Hot dog, hot dog.

3532
03:22:57,540 --> 03:22:58,620
Alright, this should be good.

3533
03:22:59,840 --> 03:23:00,680
Just don't turn around.

3534
03:23:02,180 --> 03:23:06,060
We have our nice little plot of firefly land.

3535
03:23:10,040 --> 03:23:12,220
More directionless Minecraft streams.

3536
03:23:12,560 --> 03:23:13,040
Oh, wait.

3537
03:23:13,640 --> 03:23:16,900
More directionless Minecraft streams into my blood, please.

3538
03:23:17,480 --> 03:23:17,800
Okay.

3539
03:23:18,240 --> 03:23:19,200
Let's do time.

3540
03:23:19,640 --> 03:23:20,280
Set.

3541
03:23:23,580 --> 03:23:24,300
No.

3542
03:23:27,900 --> 03:23:29,560
I don't know how to do this.

3543
03:23:29,620 --> 03:23:29,900
Set.

3544
03:23:30,360 --> 03:23:30,940
Noon.

3545
03:23:33,360 --> 03:23:34,080
Time.

3546
03:23:34,260 --> 03:23:34,620
Set.

3547
03:23:35,600 --> 03:23:36,320
Night.

3548
03:24:07,230 --> 03:24:07,890
Wow.

3549
03:24:09,230 --> 03:24:09,890
Wow.

3550
03:24:11,670 --> 03:24:12,210
Wow.

3551
03:24:13,610 --> 03:24:15,710
I can't wait for this with the shaders.

3552
03:24:20,200 --> 03:24:22,660
This with the shaders will be so pretty.

3553
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:28,960
I'm a pro composer making a snake eater cover.

3554
03:24:29,560 --> 03:24:30,040
You are?

3555
03:24:30,980 --> 03:24:31,960
Good luck.

3556
03:24:38,290 --> 03:24:39,530
It's like being in space.

3557
03:24:39,690 --> 03:24:40,070
Yeah.

3558
03:24:47,110 --> 03:24:48,850
This sounds so nice.

3559
03:24:54,370 --> 03:24:55,290
It's like...

3560
03:24:58,170 --> 03:25:01,490
There's like little red dots blinking around.

3561
03:25:01,610 --> 03:25:02,350
Do you guys see that?

3562
03:25:03,770 --> 03:25:04,260
Or is it...

3563
03:25:04,730 --> 03:25:05,470
Like blinking...

3564
03:25:05,470 --> 03:25:06,710
Yeah, I see it on OBS too.

3565
03:25:07,930 --> 03:25:08,990
They're like blinking...

3566
03:25:08,990 --> 03:25:11,350
I think they have like a little bit of a graphical error.

3567
03:25:12,190 --> 03:25:13,050
You guys don't see it?

3568
03:25:14,310 --> 03:25:17,530
The little red dots blinking around the...

3569
03:25:17,530 --> 03:25:18,150
Like in...

3570
03:25:18,590 --> 03:25:19,470
You don't see it?

3571
03:25:22,790 --> 03:25:25,310
Thank you for taking us to this grave of the fireflies.

3572
03:25:25,990 --> 03:25:26,430
Hold on.

3573
03:25:26,490 --> 03:25:28,310
I'm going to see if I can screenshot it.

3574
03:25:31,770 --> 03:25:32,410
Hold on.

3575
03:25:39,800 --> 03:25:41,100
Oh, it's not in the screenshot.

3576
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:42,860
Oh, yes it is.

3577
03:25:43,480 --> 03:25:44,120
Yes, it is.

3578
03:25:44,380 --> 03:25:44,880
Yes, it is.

3579
03:25:44,900 --> 03:25:45,260
Yes, it is.

3580
03:25:45,280 --> 03:25:45,760
Yes, it is.

3581
03:25:46,360 --> 03:25:46,780
Yes, it is.

3582
03:25:47,200 --> 03:25:47,560
Hold on.

3583
03:25:47,880 --> 03:25:48,460
I'll show you guys.

3584
03:25:48,520 --> 03:25:48,900
Look at this.

3585
03:25:53,910 --> 03:25:54,550
You see...

3586
03:25:55,290 --> 03:25:55,930
You see...

3587
03:25:57,910 --> 03:25:59,490
You see those two red dots?

3588
03:25:59,650 --> 03:26:00,370
Or red lines?

3589
03:26:02,030 --> 03:26:02,950
You see them?

3590
03:26:03,670 --> 03:26:05,390
Yeah, they kind of flicker.

3591
03:26:05,890 --> 03:26:07,710
They flicker around the...

3592
03:26:07,710 --> 03:26:09,390
Around the...

3593
03:26:10,290 --> 03:26:11,110
Fireflies a bit.

3594
03:26:12,290 --> 03:26:13,310
I knew I wasn't crazy.

3595
03:26:14,970 --> 03:26:16,490
I knew I wasn't crazy.

3596
03:26:17,910 --> 03:26:19,010
You'll see it now.

3597
03:26:22,940 --> 03:26:23,420
Probably.

3598
03:26:23,600 --> 03:26:25,080
Sorry if I just ruined this for you.

3599
03:26:27,680 --> 03:26:28,780
X-Files theme.

3600
03:26:29,760 --> 03:26:30,240
Boom.

3601
03:26:39,630 --> 03:26:41,830
Oh, you kind of lose it with the bitrate.

3602
03:26:42,010 --> 03:26:42,410
Oh no.

3603
03:26:47,730 --> 03:26:49,570
Even from far away!

3604
03:26:52,890 --> 03:26:54,650
Even from far away it's so awesome.

3605
03:26:54,750 --> 03:26:56,450
Wait, why was there so many and then I...

3606
03:26:58,210 --> 03:26:59,490
It's still on fire.

3607
03:27:01,130 --> 03:27:01,610
Hey!

3608
03:27:02,590 --> 03:27:03,710
Get out of here!

3609
03:27:05,550 --> 03:27:06,110
Okay.

3610
03:27:06,490 --> 03:27:07,670
Lots of fireflies.

3611
03:27:13,530 --> 03:27:14,090
Okay.

3612
03:27:15,090 --> 03:27:16,110
Thank you guys!

3613
03:27:17,250 --> 03:27:17,530
Otsuminto.

3614
03:27:17,910 --> 03:27:19,790
Is there a way to toggle music in this game?

3615
03:27:23,480 --> 03:27:24,980
Is there a way to toggle music?

3616
03:27:32,740 --> 03:27:33,580
I wish.

3617
03:27:33,580 --> 03:27:33,620
I wish.

3618
03:27:35,980 --> 03:27:36,620
Otsuminto!

3619
03:27:36,760 --> 03:27:37,080
Otsuminto!

3620
03:27:37,180 --> 03:27:37,700
Otsuminto!

3621
03:27:38,080 --> 03:27:38,720
Otsuminto!

3622
03:27:38,960 --> 03:27:39,400
Otsuminto!

3623
03:27:39,720 --> 03:27:39,980
Otsuminto!

3624
03:27:40,700 --> 03:27:41,340
Otsuminto!

3625
03:27:53,050 --> 03:27:53,690
Otsuminto!

3626
03:28:02,710 --> 03:28:03,350
Otsu...

3627
03:28:04,470 --> 03:28:05,650
Such a fun stream.

3628
03:28:05,750 --> 03:28:06,530
You're the best cosplayer ever.

3629
03:28:06,630 --> 03:28:08,030
Thank you daily dayo!

3630
03:28:10,230 --> 03:28:11,350
Thank you!

3631
03:28:12,150 --> 03:28:12,750
Otsuminto.

3632
03:28:13,610 --> 03:28:14,550
Have a good day.

3633
03:28:15,250 --> 03:28:16,270
Have a good night.

3634
03:28:17,210 --> 03:28:17,570
And...

3635
03:28:17,930 --> 03:28:19,230
I'll see you guys...

3636
03:28:20,410 --> 03:28:21,550
When I see you next!

3637
03:28:22,950 --> 03:28:23,650
Bye bye!

3638
03:28:39,610 --> 03:28:41,990
This will be our exit music today.

3639
03:28:43,610 --> 03:28:45,990
We'll use this as our exit music today.

3640
03:28:59,020 --> 03:29:00,100
Bye bye!

3641
03:29:00,970 --> 03:29:01,920
Moi moi.

3642
03:29:08,910 --> 03:29:09,980
He can stay.

3643
03:29:11,920 --> 03:29:13,340
Thanks for making me!

3644
03:29:13,600 --> 03:29:14,280
Thank you!

3645
03:29:15,180 --> 03:29:16,140
Bye bye!

3646
03:29:24,660 --> 03:29:25,600
I

3647
03:29:33,690 --> 03:29:36,190
can't stop singing the little...

3648
03:29:37,790 --> 03:29:39,050
Red lines though.

3649
03:29:39,670 --> 03:29:41,150
Maybe I overloaded it.

3650
03:29:55,150 --> 03:29:57,390
There's so many guys over there and then a chicken.

3651
03:30:11,470 --> 03:30:14,590
Okay, actually I'm gonna go to my ending screen or else I'll never leave!

3652
03:30:14,950 --> 03:30:15,350
Bye!
