1
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,240
Hello, everybody.

2
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,600
Hold on.

3
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,200
I rearranged my desk a little bit.

4
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,460
Now I'm confused.

5
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,340
Wait a second.

6
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,020
My... drink... should be over here.

7
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,540
Careful.

8
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,780
Careful.

9
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,860
What did I just do?

10
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,500
Nothing.

11
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,480
Nothing?

12
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,320
Okay.

13
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,120
Okay.

14
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,040
I think I'm okay.

15
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,780
Hi, Minto.

16
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,820
Hello.

17
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,420
Hello, hello, hello.

18
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,000
Hello.

19
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,240
Someone said, almost binted.

20
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,380
Totally didn't miss the vortex tree.

21
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,300
No, it's okay.

22
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,160
The learning curve is steep.

23
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,540
Learning curve?

24
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,200
I have to think in this game.

25
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,180
Have you pulled for pajama Yuka yet?

26
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,940
I did.

27
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,040
I didn't get her.

28
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,020
She's not a unique, so... I only tried a couple times.

29
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,040
And I also wasted a mini trying to get...

30
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,200
Tracksuit Yuka, which I also didn't get.

31
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,860
I got... This is about Blue Archive.

32
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,180
Sorry.

33
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,760
I never spark for...

34
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,720
For regular characters, though.

35
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,180
Koharu Nendo.

36
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,080
Yeah!

37
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,880
Koharu!

38
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,920
My favorite Blue Archive character is getting a Nendoroid.

39
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,300
And she doesn't ever get any merch.

40
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,800
And I'm so happy.

41
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,220
I'm so happy.

42
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,060
She's getting a Nendoroid.

43
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,080
I don't even collect Nendoroids, but I will.

44
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,080
Actually, I recently got two Nendoroids.

45
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,840
I got...

46
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,220
Snake Nendoroid.

47
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,800
And I got Ryden Nendoroid.

48
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,760
And I'm looking at...

49
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,000
Naked Ry...

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,800
I have...

51
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,540
I have Snake smoking the cigarette.

52
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,760
And Ryden naked.

53
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,280
Oh, sorry.

54
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,880
I forgot to turn on the streamer mode.

55
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:42,980
Han!

56
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,540
Stop it.

57
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,340
Stop it, Doki.

58
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,020
I think that's Doki.

59
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,460
Wait, how do I turn on?

60
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,040
Oh, streamer mode.

61
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,320
On.

62
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,360
Oh, no.

63
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,100
It's Laimu.

64
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,260
We have a...

65
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,120
We have a...

66
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,600
We have our...

67
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Sloppy Sisters...

68
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,220
Group chat.

69
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,960
So...

70
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,120
Hello, Laimu.

71
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:13,860
Laimu!

72
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,520
Laimu!

73
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,800
Yeah.

74
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,760
Yeah.

75
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,340
But anyway...

76
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,720
Glad to catch my Kamiyoshi stream live.

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,160
I missed the last few since we were back.

78
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,800
You missed...

79
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,380
You missed them?

80
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,860
No, I'm just kidding.

81
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,360
And you're back for 12 months!

82
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,100
Thank you!

83
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,020
I ate a Mike Tyson's ass.

84
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,380
Hi, Doki.

85
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,280
No!

86
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,100
No Doki here.

87
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,900
Hope you enjoy Voices of the Void.

88
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,300
Yeah!

89
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,440
Oh my gosh, there's so many...

90
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,280
Thank you guys for all this.

91
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,840
Thank you guys for all the returning Puffer Ships.

92
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,460
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

93
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,220
Jesse, thank you so much for the five gifted.

94
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,840
Vivicor, thank you.

95
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,220
Sura, thank you.

96
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,600
Sandro, thank you.

97
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,960
Aibu, daibu.

98
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,360
Lollipop-lop-lop-lop-lop-lop-lop-lop-lop-lop-lop-lop.

99
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,420
Welcome to Puffer Ships.

100
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,300
Thank you guys.

101
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:14,880
Oh my god.

102
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,260
Ow!

103
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,080
Thank you guys!

104
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:19,860
Thank you!

105
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,420
This is my first time ever playing Voices of the Void.

106
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,220
Actually, I know really nothing about this game.

107
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,540
So, um, it's very...

108
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,080
I don't know.

109
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,340
Actually, maybe anything about this game.

110
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Maybe that it's a horror game.

111
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,360
Yes?

112
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,840
I'm not quite sure.

113
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,780
But I like this intro music.

114
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,580
It's really...

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,580
I was kind of vibing to it.

116
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,680
And Aliens!

117
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,560
I like Aliens.

118
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,270
Totally

119
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,380
normal job sim.

120
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,720
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

121
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,840
So, no spoilers.

122
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,300
No...

123
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,140
Here, let me write it in a pin chat.

124
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,460
No, please...

125
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,180
This is my first time playing.

126
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,340
So, please no spoilers.

127
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,980
Spoilers.

128
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,600
Spoilers.

129
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,320
Or backseating.

130
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,540
Unless...

131
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,240
Requested.

132
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,440
Thank you.

133
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,200
Waving me to...

134
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,180
Sent.

135
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,010
Did I spell right?

136
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,350
Spoilers, yeah.

137
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,450
Ha ha ha ha.

138
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,450
It's not made on the steam engine, but it's designed to look and sound like it is.

139
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,270
Locomotive?

140
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,070
Locomotive?

141
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,290
Okay.

142
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,570
Anyway.

143
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,530
I guess we'll...

144
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,990
He means source.

145
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:11,530
Oh.

146
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,660
Oh.

147
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:16,720
Ha ha ha.

148
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,000
Ha ha ha.

149
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,000
Ha ha ha.

150
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,980
Ha ha ha.

151
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,260
Ha ha ha.

152
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:20,860
I was like...

153
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,740
Let's just start the game and...

154
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,600
I saw some people in pre-chat, but I'm like, we should be able to get past the tutorial.

155
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,040
I don't know what that means.

156
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,400
That makes me really scared.

157
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,220
Oh!

158
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,020
I forgot to also say...

159
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,920
My throat is being a little funky...

160
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,220
Today, so...

161
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,100
Might be a bit...

162
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,240
Shorter of a stream.

163
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,580
We shall see.

164
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,380
Be sure to enable the funny settings.

165
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,140
For the full experience.

166
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,280
It's disabled by default due to people who wanted a serious experience.

167
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,940
Funny?

168
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,440
Should I...

169
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,960
Wait.

170
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,040
Should I...

171
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,400
For people who...

172
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,980
For people who have played this...

173
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,220
And...

174
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,300
For me, a first timer...

175
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,200
Would you recommend...

176
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,680
That?

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,580
Yeah, is it a one guy?

178
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,920
I can't tell.

179
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,840
Yes, turn it on.

180
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,540
Funny setting is better.

181
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:36,780
Yes.

182
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,400
Straight up good.

183
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,200
Funny good, funny as worth.

184
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,220
Okay.

185
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,030
These were...

186
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,010
These were...

187
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,370
There was so much here.

188
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,370
Like, what?

189
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,490
There's so many settings.

190
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,610
I was like, this...

191
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,150
This...

192
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,910
Oh my god.

193
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:56,830
My brain.

194
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:57,690
Where is it?

195
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,550
What's it under, game?

196
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,590
Like, look at all this.

197
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,690
Oh, funny setting.

198
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,110
Right here?

199
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,990
Look at all this.

200
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:06,370
I...

201
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,350
I barely...

202
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,810
I like, very...

203
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,110
Very minimally glossed over it.

204
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,030
Because I was like, what?

205
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,410
I don't know what any of...

206
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,590
Like, Max Roach is.

207
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,470
Funny setting?

208
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:19,910
Apply?

209
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:21,810
Okay.

210
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:23,950
Okay.

211
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,450
Oh, we're good.

212
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,330
Okay.

213
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,430
Did this change, or...

214
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,530
Also, I think it's...

215
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,150
Why is the hints and tips...

216
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,570
So desperate to be clicked?

217
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,110
Okay.

218
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,490
Let's start.

219
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,590
I'm kind of scared.

220
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,150
Not because of the horror aspect.

221
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,270
Because of...

222
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,570
I don't know what to expect.

223
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,310
Expect the unexpected.

224
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,870
My dog is sick.

225
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,570
He's watching the stream too for healing mid-energy.

226
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,330
Boogie failed.

227
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,530
I hope you and your pup feel...

228
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,270
Well, I...

229
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:07,570
I'm...

230
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:08,510
I'm...

231
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,250
I hope your pup feels better.

232
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,710
Oh, baby.

233
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,270
Okay.

234
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,410
Start.

235
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:19,610
Oh.

236
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,290
Cover the cursor over the button to see the description of the game.

237
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:22,570
Oh.

238
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,450
I think I should do the tutorial.

239
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,250
Sandbox.

240
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,210
Let's try...

241
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:28,330
Oh.

242
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:28,770
Oh.

243
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,350
Oh.

244
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:29,870
Oh.

245
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:30,850
Uh-oh.

246
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,530
Uh-oh.

247
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,250
Uh-oh.

248
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,150
Uh-oh.

249
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,810
Uh-oh.

250
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,350
Uh-oh.

251
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:35,730
Uh-oh.

252
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,390
Uh-oh.

253
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,490
Uh-oh.

254
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:39,850
Uh-oh.

255
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:40,150
Uh-oh.

256
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,550
Why did it do that?

257
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,400
Oh, shoot.

258
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,320
Oh my god, it just ruined everything on my...

259
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,860
Oh

260
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,110
gosh, okay.

261
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,250
What the hell?

262
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,550
Hold on.

263
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,450
My entire... it just broke my entire computer.

264
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,590
Hold on.

265
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,870
Wait, why does it look like that?

266
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:14,930
Oh my god.

267
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,150
Oh no, no!

268
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,090
It just broke everything!

269
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:23,250
Oh my gosh, it did that thing where it resizes all your windows.

270
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,030
Oh my god, why did it do that?

271
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,010
Why?

272
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,870
Why, why, why?

273
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,150
Oh, I'm... I'm cut in half!

274
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,740
Oh man, it ruined all my settings!

275
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,300
One moment, please.

276
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:50,920
Oh.

277
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,740
One moment, please.

278
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,260
Oh, it's so annoying.

279
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,790
Okay, maybe if I do this...

280
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,580
But then I have to resize the game.

281
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,600
Oh.

282
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,690
And then...

283
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,640
Oh.

284
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,760
Oh.

285
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,940
Oh.

286
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,020
Oh.

287
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,780
Oh.

288
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:24,800
Oh.

289
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:24,820
Oh.

290
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,840
Okay, I'll move that there.

291
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:25,960
Okay, I'll move that there.

292
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,400
Did the game's resolution change?

293
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,100
I guess so.

294
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,420
It...

295
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,060
It's currently like a tiny window in the corner of my screen, even though I minimized it.

296
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,640
Okay.

297
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,620
Where did I go?

298
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,060
Oh god.

299
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,380
Every...

300
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh my god!

301
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,490
Every time I try to click out, it breaks my computer.

302
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,770
Okay, hold on.

303
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,510
Hold

304
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,310
on.

305
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,110
Oh gosh.

306
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:14,950
Hold on.

307
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,000
I am the voice from the void.

308
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,420
I have to...

309
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,620
Vtube studio is so messed up right now.

310
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,580
Oh, where am I?

311
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:42,780
How...

312
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,260
How did it get like this?

313
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:44,540
Wait.

314
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,560
Am I bigger?

315
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,220
Am I bigger?

316
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,820
Yes.

317
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,140
Wait.

318
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:53,610
Let's...

319
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,820
Try this.

320
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:55,920
Oh gosh.

321
00:15:59,500 --> 00:15:59,890
Okay.

322
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,070
Let me...

323
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,330
Let me move here.

324
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,890
Maybe this will not break it.

325
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,840
If I just click to...

326
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,550
To...

327
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,490
If I just click out the window...

328
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,790
This is the game, you guys.

329
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,370
If I click out of the window, it breaks.

330
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:21,590
Okay.

331
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,190
I'm gonna click back into the game now.

332
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,250
Okay.

333
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:24,750
Here we go.

334
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,560
The game is trying to give me a free lobotomy.

335
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,090
I...

336
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,150
I had it in window mode, you guys.

337
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,090
On the main menu.

338
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,910
And then...

339
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,370
When I got out of window...

340
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,690
When I started the game...

341
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,630
It turned it into full screen.

342
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,950
And now it's doing this.

343
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,730
Under video settings.

344
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,690
Uncheck automatic screen res.

345
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,850
I didn't see that.

346
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,310
Where?

347
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,350
Also, JB.

348
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,330
Thank you so much for that.

349
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,390
Check under video settings.

350
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:19,910
Game?

351
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,610
There is no video settings.

352
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,160
Render?

353
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,590
Uh...

354
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:55,940
Effects?

355
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,520
Oh, oh.

356
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,240
Okay, okay, okay.

357
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,600
Okay, now let me...

358
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,200
Okay, apply.

359
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,180
Okay, back.

360
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,060
Okay, F11.

361
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:06,980
Oh!

362
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:07,540
Oh!

363
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,880
Oh!

364
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:08,940
Oh!

365
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,900
Now it's so small!

366
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,130
Okay, hold on.

367
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:14,250
Man.

368
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,060
Why would they put it under effects?

369
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,460
Right?

370
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,860
Is this part of the game?

371
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,060
Yeah, this is the tutorial.

372
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,260
This is the tutorial of the game, obviously.

373
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,980
I'm learning how to play the game.

374
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,340
Okay, you know what?

375
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,620
We'll just play it like this.

376
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,240
Okay, if I click out...

377
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,500
Oh!

378
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,740
We're saved!

379
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,380
We're saved!

380
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,000
We're saved!

381
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Okay, I have to fix me again.

382
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,660
Okay!

383
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,200
Awesome!

384
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,460
I think...

385
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,900
I think we're okay.

386
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:57,900
Yeah.

387
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,640
I think...

388
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,420
I think we're...

389
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,100
Why am I so far...

390
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,440
Hold on.

391
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,200
I have to fix real quick.

392
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,900
I have to fix real quick.

393
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,500
Why is it like this?

394
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,220
What?

395
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,820
Oh, maybe if I do this.

396
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,840
Oh, I'm cut off again.

397
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,260
Hold on.

398
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,080
Hold on.

399
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,780
I'm troubleshooting.

400
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,740
Give me a second.

401
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,140
Give me a second!

402
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,380
Maybe...

403
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,150
JB, thank you!

404
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,450
For telling me about that setting.

405
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,030
I'll fix all my other windows later, I suppose.

406
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,430
We're doing it live!

407
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,490
We're doing it live!

408
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,590
That's how you know...

409
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,590
It's not pre-recorded.

410
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,650
Did I say that I was live on... Twitter?

411
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,110
Hold on.

412
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,510
I didn't.

413
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,330
I forgot.

414
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:10,350
Hold on.

415
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,010
Um... Haunting... Now.

416
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,170
A long while ago.

417
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,270
Nano, don't screenshot that.

418
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,750
Why is that the first thing that shows up in my timeline?

419
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,730
Me cut in half.

420
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,670
Why?

421
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,050
Is chat pre-recorded?

422
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,530
Yeah...

423
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,650
That's the only thing I have to pre-record.

424
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,770
To make it look like people are watching me.

425
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,230
You know?

426
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,310
To make me feel a little less lonely.

427
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,190
Hmm... Raise your hand if you're getting purred!

428
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,350
Nobody's hands should be up.

429
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,970
You're an unpaid actor.

430
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,930
Me, me, me!

431
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,090
She doesn't pay us.

432
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,710
You guys are getting paid.

433
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,350
You're not.

434
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,960
Pre-recorded super chat.

435
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,180
Thank you!

436
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,160
And this is a pre-recorded...

437
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,180
Uh... This is... This is me.

438
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,320
Uh... Uh... Oh!

439
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:28,860
Hold on.

440
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,060
Wait.

441
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,540
Wait.

442
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,120
Hold on.

443
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,480
Hold on.

444
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,500
I'm gonna commit to this bit.

445
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,720
Hold on.

446
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:39,520
Hold on.

447
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:39,540
Hold on.

448
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,980
Did you guys see that the...

449
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,780
Alarmo, the Nintendo Alarmo got an update?

450
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,260
I thought it included Animal Crossing music to begin with.

451
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,860
But apparently it didn't.

452
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,920
But I feel like Animal Crossing music...

453
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,700
Is the perfect...

454
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,160
Wait.

455
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,440
Hold on.

456
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,300
I gotta commit to this bit.

457
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,610
I feel like Animal Crossing music is the perfect thing to wake up to.

458
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,830
Why wouldn't they have it?

459
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,950
At the very beginning.

460
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,250
But what's also so funny...

461
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,650
Is that...

462
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,210
It includes...

463
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,450
The...

464
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,250
The talking.

465
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:20,430
The talking.

466
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,550
And so...

467
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,130
It includes the...

468
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,830
Like the little Animal Crossing chatter.

469
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,250
So like...

470
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,310
You are hearing the alarm go off and the music playing.

471
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,390
But you also hear like...

472
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,350
Like...

473
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,170
A KK Slider being like...

474
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,370
And it's just kind of funny.

475
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,250
Wait.

476
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:43,830
Can you hear that?

477
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,830
Can you hear that?

478
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,630
I turned the music all the way up.

479
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:47,990
Wait.

480
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:48,530
Can you hear that?

481
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,190
Play louder.

482
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,570
Play louder.

483
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,490
Play louder.

484
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,400
Oh!

485
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,460
That was my cue.

486
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,140
That was my alarm cue.

487
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,240
To...

488
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,940
Thank the super...

489
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,400
The pre-recorded super chat.

490
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,350
My bit flopped.

491
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,510
Good bit?

492
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:21,950
Really?

493
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,210
That was the bit?

494
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:25,770
Mm-hmm.

495
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,310
Yeah.

496
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,900
It did not.

497
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,620
I'm cracking up.

498
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,620
I was really looking forward to cracking up.

499
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,100
I haven't cracked up in...

500
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,200
Plus two!

501
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,840
Okay.

502
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,700
I'm a little traumatized to play this game now.

503
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,340
But...

504
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,460
I will play it.

505
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,520
I will play it.

506
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,220
Welcome to Voices of the Void.

507
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,860
In this tutorial, you will learn basic knowledge about the game and its mechanics.

508
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,680
Divided in three stages.

509
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,980
Controls, interactions, game...

510
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,720
Play...

511
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:08,920
Loop?

512
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,420
Is this out or what?

513
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,800
Did I trick myself?

514
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:12,900
Oh love.

515
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,060
Boom, boom, boom.

516
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Boom, boom, wow, boom, wow, wow, boom, boom, bah, wow.

517
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,520
Boom, bam, bam, bam,

518
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,070
bam.

519
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,910
I'll walk through the floating icons for instructions.

520
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:40,350
Instructions on controls, mechanics, using equipment, and other important information.

521
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,770
Proceed through the door to stage one controls.

522
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,710
Or you can skip the tutorial by going back to the venue.

523
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,610
Wow!

524
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,310
That's... Can I drown?

525
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,410
What's in there?

526
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,290
What's the point of this room?

527
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,230
I see... no health.

528
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,430
I can't die in this game.

529
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,000
Basic controls.

530
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,600
Walk.

531
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,420
Jump.

532
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,180
Sprint.

533
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,820
Crouch.

534
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,320
Toss.

535
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,700
While holding an object.

536
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,580
Okay, so E to hold the object.

537
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:36,820
Rotate.

538
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,220
Oh.

539
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,620
Flashlight.

540
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,540
Zoom.

541
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,440
Select action.

542
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,440
Wait, what is this?

543
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,980
What did I just do?

544
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,940
What just happened to me?

545
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,600
Wait.

546
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,580
I think I pressed C.

547
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,060
What did I just do?

548
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,430
I pressed C instead of...

549
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,520
C to ragdoll.

550
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,560
Can I just lay here?

551
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,120
Do I need to play dead sometimes?

552
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,340
Because the alien?

553
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,120
Tab is in the inventory.

554
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,440
What's this?

555
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,520
A compass.

556
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,700
Oh, everything in...

557
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,560
Wait, what's this?

558
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,740
I got glasses!

559
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,920
Nerd.

560
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,660
These...

561
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,160
These...

562
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,620
Oh my gosh.

563
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,440
Total volume?

564
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,640
What?

565
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,810
Discharge...

566
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,510
Fluid?

567
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,010
Flashlight is not equipped.

568
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:49,690
Oh!

569
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,110
How do I get out of my inventory?

570
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,830
Okay, here we go.

571
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:56,650
Okay.

572
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,410
I have no...

573
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,850
Oh wait, I do have actions now.

574
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,310
Select action.

575
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,750
Compass.

576
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,270
Oh my god, this sound effect.

577
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,730
It looked like a fluid.

578
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,010
FL should mean fluid, no?

579
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,560
No?

580
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,780
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

581
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,620
I feel like it is.

582
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,820
A standard battery used in flashlights.

583
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:26,720
Oh no!

584
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,860
Does my flashlight run out of battery?

585
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,280
Oh, it's the worst mechanic ever.

586
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,060
I hate realism in my video game!

587
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,460
Hot key combo keys.

588
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,180
Alt E.

589
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,520
Quick use action.

590
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:44,800
E...

591
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,760
Alt?

592
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,360
What's the difference?

593
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,560
I guess you're E and then you're Alt, or you're Alt and then you're E?

594
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,760
E-R?

595
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,580
I'm not sick, am I?

596
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:57,860
Throw...

597
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,820
Okay, I'm not gonna remember these, probably.

598
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:00,880
Oh wait!

599
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,560
I thought this was Tabasco.

600
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,780
Grab.

601
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,430
How do I get up there?

602
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,400
What just happened?

603
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,490
What just happened?

604
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,830
I can hold the whole table?

605
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,310
Object is too heavy.

606
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,750
Wait, no it's not.

607
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,790
Too heavy my butt!

608
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,500
Push!

609
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,040
Push!

610
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,180
Push!

611
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,740
I'm gonna drown it.

612
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,620
How do I throw it?

613
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,940
Come on!

614
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,980
Come on!

615
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,800
Is it stuck?

616
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,040
What are these?

617
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,920
Gas cans!

618
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,260
Whoa!

619
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,440
Big splash.

620
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,020
MRE!

621
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,440
Eee!

622
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:27,600
Oops!

623
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,100
I got it in my head.

624
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,260
Can we eat it?

625
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,380
Food box.

626
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,180
Oh wait, use.

627
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:34,800
Hold on.

628
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,740
Oh, you can!

629
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,140
Ow!

630
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,400
Oh, I'm not hungry.

631
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,540
How do I know if I'm hungry or not?

632
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,180
Oh, clearly I am.

633
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,580
I keep eating.

634
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,100
More batteries.

635
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,520
Collect.

636
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,540
Okay.

637
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,920
Oh, I could collect anything I want.

638
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:54,920
Wait.

639
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,200
Okay.

640
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,000
Oh, this is the combo.

641
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,440
Play around with some props.

642
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,320
Alternatively, use mouse wheel or number keys while looking at an object to select action.

643
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,500
Then press E.

644
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,080
For heavier objects, use E to grab or shift E to...

645
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,400
Shift E!

646
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,400
Oh.

647
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,680
I can't jump very high.

648
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,580
Maybe I should have used that...

649
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,640
Um, here.

650
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,600
Nice soup.

651
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,000
Wait, hold on.

652
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,260
We can save this.

653
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:38,980
Yeah?

654
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,600
We can save this.

655
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,830
There's a burger on the floor.

656
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,550
I collected some food with me while I did that.

657
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,590
Um, here's the quick select bar located at the top of the screen.

658
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,190
Oh, sorry.

659
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,910
To use the quick select bar...

660
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,790
Press the 0 to 9 key.

661
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:07,810
Okay.

662
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,290
So, like...

663
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,170
5...

664
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:12,650
Uh, 4.

665
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,010
There's a battery.

666
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:15,550
Okay.

667
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,310
What's over here?

668
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,650
Precision placement.

669
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,170
Hold the object in your hand.

670
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,430
Hold left shift.

671
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,690
And left alt.

672
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:23,790
Look at any surface.

673
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,070
Use mouse wheel to turn the object.

674
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,890
Press R to place an object precisely.

675
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,390
Oh, God.

676
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,580
What, do we go down or up?

677
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,420
Curious.

678
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,240
So curious.

679
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,080
I can't jump at all.

680
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,340
Wait, maybe if I shift...

681
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:41,940
Oh.

682
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,420
Oh, it's the Gamer Crouch Jump!

683
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:44,600
Ah.

684
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,740
This really is Half-Life.

685
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:48,760
Ah.

686
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,780
I see.

687
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,460
My food.

688
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,060
Wait, what's the S stand for though?

689
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,780
Food is a hundred.

690
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,340
I'm a little...

691
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,480
I'm a little tubby.

692
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,620
Well, collect.

693
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,820
Take the burger.

694
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,440
Oh, sleep stamina.

695
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,020
Oh.

696
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,120
Whoa.

697
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,760
So hold on, okay.

698
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,440
I failed successfully, I think.

699
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,600
Is there a fall damage?

700
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,060
Let's try.

701
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,840
Oh, maybe not.

702
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:23,820
Whoa.

703
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,540
Whoa.

704
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,660
Oh, my eyes.

705
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,300
There is, but it's generous.

706
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,300
You will learn how to use your inventory and object actions.

707
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,900
Show me the aliens.

708
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:44,740
Oh, my God.

709
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,540
There's so many things to remember.

710
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:47,380
Okay.

711
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,400
Tab opens your inventory.

712
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,060
Yeah, we know that.

713
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,260
Look at desired item and select the collect option.

714
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,200
Then press E.

715
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:53,860
Alternately.

716
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,200
Select grab and use the alt hot key.

717
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,080
Use items from your inventory by selecting action key.

718
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,220
Tin foil hat.

719
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:05,300
What?

720
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,100
Is there a way I can see myself?

721
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,820
I want to see my little hat.

722
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,940
I probably look like a Hershey's kiss.

723
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,700
Lean mirrors.

724
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:27,800
I mean.

725
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,280
Crouch down and look up.

726
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,000
Sometimes you can.

727
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,730
I feel like I probably look like the guys in Phasmophobia right now.

728
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,120
Okay.

729
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,440
Put stores the item in the selected container from your inventory.

730
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,960
Drops the item from your inventory.

731
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,220
Place the deposit item on the surface.

732
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,560
Info gives information.

733
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,700
Wait.

734
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:02,900
Okay.

735
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,220
Hold the clips in your hand.

736
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:06,640
Equip.

737
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,940
Certain items can be equipped.

738
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:08,380
Yeah.

739
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,680
To unequip, select the equipment button on the top left of the inventory.

740
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,700
And select the objects icon.

741
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,020
Okay.

742
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,580
Use the mouse wheel to select the use action and then use the item.

743
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,780
When using the battery to swap out.

744
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,900
Oh, my flashlight's not equipped.

745
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,280
But it is.

746
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,900
Well, it's in my...

747
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,460
Wait, hold on.

748
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,720
How do I use it though?

749
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,680
Oh.

750
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,400
Wait.

751
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,580
Can I drag it?

752
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:36,880
No.

753
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:37,480
Equip.

754
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,140
There we go.

755
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:38,480
Okay.

756
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,780
So then...

757
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:42,640
Use.

758
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,600
Aha!

759
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,440
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

760
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,640
To use an item on an object, hold the item, target the object, and press LUMB.

761
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,100
Refueling the ATV with the fuel can, look at the fuel can in front and use LUMB.

762
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,760
Wait, in front of where?

763
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,320
LUMB.

764
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,600
Are these the aliens?

765
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,340
Maybe.

766
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,030
Fuel tank.

767
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,970
None of these seem to be a fuel tank.

768
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,350
Unless...

769
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,550
I'm crazy.

770
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,390
Wait, what's this?

771
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,090
A crowbar.

772
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:34,450
Oh.

773
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:38,060
When wielding certain objects such as tools, they can be used...

774
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,190
Uh oh.

775
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:43,490
Pressing LUMB while holding the crowbar allows it to be swung as a weapon?

776
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,010
Or a fire extinguisher?

777
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,550
What sense does that make?

778
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,170
What about that flesh in a toilet?

779
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,130
Half-Life for real, for real.

780
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,550
Did I get tricked?

781
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,290
Into playing Half-Life?

782
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,750
Did I get tricked?

783
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,010
Maybe.

784
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,450
I was just thinking the other day.

785
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,530
I was just like...

786
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:11,970
Oh yeah.

787
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,710
I gotta get around to playing Half-Life 2.

788
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,100
I wanna get up here though.

789
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,080
It looks like we continue from there.

790
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,900
How do I...

791
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,040
Okay, hold on.

792
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:26,840
Oop.

793
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,300
Oop.

794
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:28,580
Wait.

795
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:29,980
There we go.

796
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,280
Okay.

797
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,390
What's that up there?

798
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,310
Hmm.

799
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,470
Mysterious.

800
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:39,550
Let's see.

801
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,350
Maybe if I get on top of...

802
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,880
Oh.

803
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,460
Dang it.

804
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,160
Double space to climb?

805
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,540
I don't think so.

806
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,650
Perhaps a ghost trick.

807
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,860
Alt F4 to climb.

808
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,830
You know...

809
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,330
Jack Sweeney...

810
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,230
For like...

811
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,350
Because of how complicated this game is...

812
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,730
For a second, I really believed you.

813
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,690
For a second...

814
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,370
I was like...

815
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:41,510
Oh.

816
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,010
Okay.

817
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,920
I really believed you for a second.

818
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,520
I was just like...

819
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:49,740
Oh yeah.

820
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,220
This game uses a bunch of controllers.

821
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,040
I believed you.

822
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,660
Crouch C.

823
00:37:59,340 --> 00:37:59,440
Oh.

824
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,760
Oh.

825
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,080
Oh.

826
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:02,840
Oh.

827
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:02,900
Oh.

828
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:11,610
Oh.

829
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,330
I'm sorry?

830
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:12,930
No.

831
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,770
Don't be sorry.

832
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,070
Wait.

833
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:20,350
Okay.

834
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:20,710
Hold on.

835
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,030
It was a...

836
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,190
Shift E to push.

837
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:24,490
Right?

838
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

839
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,850
Oh.

840
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,250
I'm causing all sorts of troubles here.

841
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,690
Okay, come on.

842
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,030
Please.

843
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:34,750
Metal table.

844
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,610
I need you to cooperate with me.

845
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,130
Here.

846
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,750
I'm shifting.

847
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,010
And I'm pressing E.

848
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,150
Okay, here we go.

849
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,470
Okay, okay, okay.

850
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:44,550
Wait.

851
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,150
Jump.

852
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,270
There we go.

853
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:46,670
Okay.

854
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,310
I did it!

855
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,390
Oh!

856
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,420
Right?

857
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,080
What is this?

858
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,560
Used to make satellite reports and name tags.

859
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,280
Like what?

860
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,430
Used to read.

861
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:27,910
Oh!

862
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,050
Where'd I...

863
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,830
Where'd I put it?

864
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:31,630
Wait.

865
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:33,650
Oh.

866
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:34,350
Wait.

867
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,010
Right click when holding.

868
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:39,690
Huh!

869
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:40,970
Oh.

870
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,150
Uh...

871
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:51,900
In here?

872
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,610
Does this game have jump scares?

873
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,950
There's a brick wall.

874
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,460
Who is that?

875
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,340
Is there really something in there?

876
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,440
Spooky, freaky.

877
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,780
Um...

878
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,980
How do I drop the note?

879
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,780
How do I get rid of it?

880
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:41,900
Drop...

881
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,420
Oh.

882
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,640
Uh...

883
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,180
Crumple.

884
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:44,680
Wait.

885
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,740
I can make it into a tag.

886
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,300
It's mine now.

887
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,980
My name tag.

888
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,620
A name tag can be set...

889
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,840
Can set a name for an item.

890
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,220
It will display the name...

891
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:04,740
Oh my gosh.

892
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,600
It's just like Minecraft.

893
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:06,380
Okay.

894
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,040
Okay.

895
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:12,980
Let's see.

896
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,260
What do we want to...

897
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,940
Let's give it to...

898
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,060
The table.

899
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,200
How do I...

900
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,440
Uh...

901
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:23,680
Eat?

902
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,560
No.

903
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,160
There we go.

904
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:28,840
There we go.

905
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:32,840
Uh...

906
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,300
Uh...

907
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:35,940
No.

908
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,460
Hold on.

909
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,020
Oh gosh.

910
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,340
This is part of the tutorial, obviously.

911
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:40,660
Okay.

912
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,080
Hold.

913
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,520
And then...

914
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,280
Wait.

915
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,620
Where'd it go?

916
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,680
Oh wait.

917
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,500
It's in my inventory.

918
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,960
Uh...

919
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,680
How do I use it?

920
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,460
Hold.

921
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:03,790
What?

922
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,640
Oh.

923
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,260
It's gone.

924
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,560
That's it.

925
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,060
It's kind of freaky.

926
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,000
It's actually even more scary.

927
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,880
Because it's just there.

928
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,680
It's a ghostly reminder.

929
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:43,780
Behind you.

930
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,720
There's nothing.

931
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,980
There's nothing.

932
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:52,640
Wait.

933
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,640
Okay.

934
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,820
Let's see what else we got down here.

935
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,000
Oh.

936
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,540
This is a drive box.

937
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,440
Used to sell drives and collect points.

938
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,140
Open the lid.

939
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,140
Place the drives inside.

940
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:04,700
Close the lid.

941
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,180
Place the box on the delivery zone.

942
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,140
And call the drone.

943
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,840
Is this a strand game?

944
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,840
Are these the drives?

945
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,100
Yes.

946
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:12,760
Oh.

947
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,300
You can practice by putting drives in the drive box.

948
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:16,880
Open the drives.

949
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:17,860
Open the box.

950
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,140
Hold the drive in your hand.

951
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,620
Oh my god.

952
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,040
What?

953
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,290
Okay.

954
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,990
Hold the drive in your hand.

955
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:36,730
Press.

956
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,310
And put the drive in the box.

957
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:39,510
Okay.

958
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:39,850
Hold on.

959
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:40,650
First.

960
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,050
How do I open it?

961
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,380
Uh.

962
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:00,760
Uh.

963
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,280
Uh.

964
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:05,720
Alt R.

965
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,720
Nope.

966
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,720
Oh gosh.

967
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,100
Nope.

968
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:10,880
That's...

969
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:10,980
Oh.

970
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:11,620
Where?

971
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,000
Ah.

972
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,260
It opened up like...

973
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:15,800
What's it called?

974
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,220
It opened up...

975
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,420
It opened up like...

976
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:21,640
My...

977
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,340
My...

978
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,420
Graphics card...

979
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:23,840
Stuff.

980
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,500
Wait a second.

981
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,860
You guys, I have to show you what it's telling me.

982
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,380
That I'm playing.

983
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,420
What is this?

984
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,560
Hold on.

985
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,540
I think it's incorrect.

986
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,140
I think my graphics card's a little confused.

987
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,360
Look at this.

988
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,700
This is what it says I'm playing right now.

989
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,940
I'm playing Devil May Cry 5.

990
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,400
But also with the logo for...

991
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,340
VTube Studio.

992
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,840
Yeah.

993
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,940
That's kind of silly.

994
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,460
Hmm.

995
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,960
Oops, hold on.

996
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,000
Wait.

997
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,220
Alt R.

998
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:24,880
It disappeared.

999
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:25,420
Wait.

1000
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,240
Alt R.

1001
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,840
It opened it up again.

1002
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,420
Also, my average FPS...

1003
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,100
Is 5,000 frames per second.

1004
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,940
Holy cow!

1005
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,340
Oh, I have an update for my driver.

1006
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,400
Actually, this was so useful to open up.

1007
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,120
Thank you guys.

1008
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,940
Um, but how do I drop the lid if that doesn't work?

1009
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,540
If Alt R doesn't work...

1010
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,780
What do I do?

1011
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,380
Left click?

1012
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:05,780
No.

1013
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:05,860
No.

1014
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,240
My leggies.

1015
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,340
Uh, left click doesn't work.

1016
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:13,560
Unless...

1017
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,780
Uh, doesn't...

1018
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:22,840
Alt...

1019
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,580
Left button.

1020
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,420
I'll get that when I need it again.

1021
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,080
Okay, let's see.

1022
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:32,820
Uh...

1023
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,540
Press...

1024
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,600
To put the...

1025
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,360
Press left mouse button to put the drive in the box.

1026
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:37,600
Okay.

1027
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:39,820
Grab.

1028
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,900
Oh, okay.

1029
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,460
Oh!

1030
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,640
It worked so easily.

1031
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:46,960
Okay.

1032
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,080
Okay, nice.

1033
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,780
Okay, awesome.

1034
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,300
Easy peasy.

1035
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:55,900
Okay.

1036
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,760
I thought we were gonna have to do the precision.

1037
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,940
I'm sure there's a mode where you have to do the precision...

1038
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:01,480
Precision?

1039
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,400
Wait a second.

1040
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:03,880
What's this?

1041
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:08,450
Okay.

1042
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:11,550
Don't need it.

1043
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:16,570
Free run.

1044
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,110
Uh...

1045
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,350
Thank you for the gifted.

1046
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,360
Oh, I need that.

1047
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,760
Can I uncrumple it?

1048
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,440
It's pretty heavy for some paper.

1049
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:34,740
Wait, hold on.

1050
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,040
Uh, hold.

1051
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:37,740
Uncrumple.

1052
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:39,740
And...

1053
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,060
Wait, hold on.

1054
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,080
Kobe!

1055
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,190
Wow, I made it!

1056
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,290
Oh, where is it?

1057
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:51,770
Okay, here we go.

1058
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:52,090
Hold on.

1059
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:52,630
Collect.

1060
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,590
There's gotta be a way to uncrumple the paper.

1061
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:57,950
Hmm...

1062
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,030
A crumpled scrap of paper.

1063
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,030
Hmm...

1064
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:05,870
Hmm...

1065
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:06,750
Hmm...

1066
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,950
Hmm...

1067
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:08,110
Hmm...

1068
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:08,870
Hmm...

1069
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:10,210
Holy three point!

1070
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,970
I was once on a basketball team.

1071
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:25,850
Um...

1072
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:26,510
I didn't play.

1073
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,410
I was benched the whole time.

1074
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:30,570
Yeah.

1075
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:44,900
Um...

1076
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,320
Guys?

1077
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,200
What's behind me?

1078
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,200
I...

1079
00:48:59,200 --> 00:48:59,820
What was that?

1080
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,780
I hear footsteps...

1081
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,280
I feel...

1082
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,520
I hear...

1083
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,680
I hear foot...

1084
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,280
I hear...

1085
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:11,620
I hear foot...

1086
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,300
foot...

1087
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,520
I hear tip-taps!

1088
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:20,710
And then you...

1089
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:21,530
Heard the water.

1090
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,010
Get the crowb...

1091
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,170
I'm too scared to move!

1092
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,390
I thought the tutorial was safe!

1093
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,080
I'm so scared.

1094
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,880
You only heard the water.

1095
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,760
There was definitely...

1096
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,760
Tippy-taps.

1097
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,520
Dude, did you hear that?

1098
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,940
That was someone going up the stairs.

1099
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:10,560
Or down!

1100
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,320
Wait, is the sound...

1101
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,340
That low for you guys?

1102
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,940
Should I turn it up?

1103
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,380
I hear a very faint ambiance.

1104
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:37,410
I'll turn it up for you guys.

1105
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,020
Oh, it should...

1106
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,260
Should've said something sooner!

1107
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,600
I don't wanna get jump-scared.

1108
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,800
Wait, I'm scared.

1109
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,540
I'm actually scared!

1110
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,080
Wait!

1111
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,180
Okay, I'm gonna start moving again.

1112
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,120
Oh!

1113
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,620
Wait, that wasn't there before, was it?

1114
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,660
In the water?

1115
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,440
Um, hold?

1116
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:32,130
Oh!

1117
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,090
Oh!

1118
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:33,470
Oh!

1119
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,510
I thought it was in the water!

1120
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,190
It's above...

1121
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:39,150
It's right here!

1122
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:39,770
Oh!

1123
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:41,250
Okay.

1124
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:44,530
Okay.

1125
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:45,910
Okay.

1126
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,890
I feel better with my crowbar.

1127
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,890
But I don't feel good at all, actually.

1128
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:57,450
What fell in the water, you think?

1129
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,810
What was walking around?

1130
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:02,370
The drone!

1131
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,390
I'm so scared.

1132
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:05,510
This is an item box.

1133
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,030
Use to sell unwanted items.

1134
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,330
Store the items inside the box.

1135
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,790
Place on the delivery zone and call the drone.

1136
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,550
This is the drone control panel.

1137
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,350
Use this control to call the drone.

1138
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,010
It will arrive shortly.

1139
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:18,190
Okay.

1140
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,030
And these are...

1141
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:23,710
Your food and stamina are shown in the bottom left.

1142
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:24,090
Yeah.

1143
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:25,870
Wait, I'm at a hundred.

1144
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:26,470
How?

1145
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:27,090
I didn't eat.

1146
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,530
He will drain over time.

1147
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,810
Food can be refilled by consuming food items.

1148
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:32,950
While stamina can be ref...

1149
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,010
Restored by sleeping.

1150
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:37,630
Certain food items also restore stamina as well.

1151
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:40,970
There's a scary ghost in the corner.

1152
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:44,750
There.

1153
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:46,370
Um...

1154
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:47,050
Food info.

1155
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,450
A varied diet is necess...

1156
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:55,990
A varied diet is necessary to prevent boredom and maximize food gain.

1157
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:00,230
They're like, you will not live like a damn cat.

1158
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:03,090
You are going to get a different...

1159
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:03,910
You...

1160
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:04,830
Okay.

1161
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:05,350
I...

1162
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:06,090
I don't know.

1163
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:06,950
I've like...

1164
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,970
I don't know how some people can eat the same thing every single day.

1165
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,450
I'm definitely not one of those types of people.

1166
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:14,850
That's why I have to possess so many different kinds of people.

1167
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,290
Because I'm just like, I always want to eat something different every day.

1168
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,340
There's just some people that are...

1169
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,080
There's certain foods I could eat every day.

1170
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,500
Probably rice.

1171
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,580
I could eat rice every day.

1172
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,400
But...

1173
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,920
I couldn't eat...

1174
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,440
If I'm just like, oh, I had spaghetti yesterday, I don't want spaghetti today.

1175
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,420
Even though I love spaghetti.

1176
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,460
And then sometimes I want to get pizza, but the pizzas are too big.

1177
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,380
And then I have to eat them for multiple days.

1178
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,620
And then I'm like...

1179
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,960
Food is best kept fresh in the fridge to prevent spoiling.

1180
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,340
And more nutritious when heated up.

1181
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:03,700
Okay.

1182
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:06,780
Alright.

1183
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,640
Okay, I gotta get the...

1184
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,520
Keypad locks the door behind the password.

1185
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:19,040
You can enter the code using two ways.

1186
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,780
Use physical buttons on the keypad or simply use keyboard...

1187
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,300
No...

1188
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,600
Keyboard number keys.

1189
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,020
I'll try to enter the correct password.

1190
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,740
Press E on the body of the keypad or click the green button.

1191
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,220
Okay.

1192
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,820
Was there anything else I needed to do?

1193
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,360
Hold the paper with reports.

1194
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,260
The one I crumpled.

1195
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:36,760
The one I crumpled.

1196
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:36,920
Uh-oh.

1197
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:40,920
Hmm.

1198
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,500
Press LMB to put it on top.

1199
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,580
You don't need to for this tutorial.

1200
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,200
Okay.

1201
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:00,920
Destroy the crates.

1202
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:01,460
Okay.

1203
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:01,580
Okay.

1204
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,960
Oh, it's out of battery.

1205
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,540
That scared me.

1206
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,280
I'm turning it down.

1207
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,600
Holy moly.

1208
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,460
That was so stinking loud.

1209
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,540
Oh wait.

1210
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:35,960
Oh, the battery.

1211
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:36,420
Use.

1212
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,260
Oh, the battery lasts a long time though.

1213
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:46,560
Gra...

1214
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,040
Uh...

1215
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:47,360
C...

1216
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:47,880
Hold.

1217
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,530
What is going on?

1218
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,630
How do I...

1219
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:01,490
Hold the drive box lid.

1220
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,630
Press LMB.

1221
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:04,410
Ah, okay.

1222
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,770
Where's my crowbo...

1223
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:09,090
Oh, here.

1224
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,010
Hold.

1225
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:20,830
There we go.

1226
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,340
What's the password?

1227
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,540
Ah.

1228
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,640
No password.

1229
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,260
Watch this game is so loud.

1230
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:45,900
I was like...

1231
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,080
I'm gonna turn it down a little bit.

1232
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,700
Um...

1233
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,060
Does it matter?

1234
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,460
Does it matter?

1235
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:05,780
Choose.

1236
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,020
I'm green.

1237
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,060
So...

1238
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:09,940
I'm gonna go green.

1239
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:11,820
Whee!

1240
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:15,600
Oh.

1241
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,260
It really didn't matter.

1242
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,600
I just talked about pizza.

1243
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,040
The game...

1244
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:22,100
Oh.

1245
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:23,560
Somehow...

1246
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,240
I'm so good at this.

1247
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,180
Somehow I got directly inside the floaty tube.

1248
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,980
Why does this feel like the back rooms for real?

1249
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,160
When did this game come out?

1250
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,000
This is your computer table.

1251
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,180
It has four main...

1252
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,180
Terminals.

1253
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,000
You will...

1254
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,540
Use to gather, download, process, and listen to signals.

1255
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,780
Try to get a signal by following the directions given by the hint nodes.

1256
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,200
They are marked...

1257
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,540
Sequentially, step by step.

1258
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:01,740
Okay.

1259
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,080
Sorry, I thought I was about to sneeze.

1260
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:04,740
Okay.

1261
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:06,740
Whoa.

1262
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:07,220
Whoa.

1263
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:07,800
Whoa.

1264
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,060
Whoa.

1265
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,300
Whoa.

1266
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:10,480
Whoa.

1267
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,600
Wait, hold on.

1268
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,220
Nothing in the water.

1269
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,920
Little hot tub.

1270
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,720
Wait, I can take the floaty.

1271
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:21,800
It's kind of fun.

1272
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:23,740
Okay.

1273
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,280
Oh.

1274
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,720
Okay, where's step one?

1275
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,840
Okay, here we go.

1276
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:32,820
Floor!

1277
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,380
Happy birthday!

1278
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,080
Happy, happy birthday!

1279
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,260
Hope your week has been great.

1280
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:39,820
You too!

1281
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,980
You too, you too!

1282
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,980
We have Mint trying to reach out to Wife Maturicon.

1283
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:51,300
Wife!

1284
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,960
Okay, use the WASTA keys to move the cursor.

1285
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,160
Shift runs a scan and gives directions to various signals.

1286
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,620
Press enter on a found signal to ping.

1287
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,500
If successful, proceed to the downloads panel.

1288
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:09,820
I'm watching.

1289
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:09,920
I'm watching.

1290
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:10,660
Oh.

1291
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:17,810
How do I know?

1292
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,260
How do I know?

1293
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:27,140
Oh.

1294
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,040
Oh, here we go.

1295
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:28,520
The shift.

1296
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,580
Let's go this way.

1297
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:33,880
Oh!

1298
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:34,240
Oh!

1299
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:35,660
I found it!

1300
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,040
Now, then I go to the download?

1301
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:40,960
Wait, what does this say?

1302
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:41,660
Ignore?

1303
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:43,400
Hmm.

1304
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,820
Doesn't do anything.

1305
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,440
Yes, we can ignore it.

1306
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:47,220
Oh, enter key!

1307
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:49,420
Oh.

1308
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:51,380
Weak or no signal.

1309
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,340
Thank you guys for helping me out.

1310
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,220
I really appreciate it.

1311
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,200
Hugo!

1312
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1313
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,280
Don't apologize.

1314
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,520
Thank you though.

1315
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,400
Gotta try again.

1316
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,640
But that's what a signal looks like, no?

1317
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:22,400
Oh!

1318
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,900
Oh, there's two, there's two.

1319
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,200
And done.

1320
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:28,700
Oh!

1321
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,800
We got it, we got it, we got it.

1322
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:31,180
Okay.

1323
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,100
So then...

1324
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,480
I go to the down...

1325
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,120
Okay, step two.

1326
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,820
Oh my god!

1327
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,520
Wait, it says no signal.

1328
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,000
Adjust the polarity and frequency.

1329
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:45,780
Look at the bottom part of the panel.

1330
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,260
Turn on the toggles first.

1331
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,880
Change the polarity from the mouse room.

1332
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,000
Polarity and the local discursion value is changing.

1333
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,300
I touch the polarity in order to get out to the left.

1334
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:00,820
Whoa!

1335
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1336
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,180
Something's happening.

1337
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:10,720
A planet.

1338
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,960
Do I need to do anything?

1339
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,020
Wait, look at the bottom of the panel.

1340
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,760
Oh, wow.

1341
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:26,620
Wait, okay.

1342
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,600
Turn the toggles.

1343
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,540
Oh, did we get raiden?

1344
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,460
Thank you!

1345
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:41,980
Sorry, I didn't see.

1346
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,280
Thank you for the redirect.

1347
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,360
Thank you, thank you.

1348
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,320
I'm in the tutorial of this game.

1349
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,680
It's been over an hour.

1350
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,120
To be fair, I talked for some.

1351
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,140
A little bit.

1352
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:55,860
Wait, hold on.

1353
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,940
I can't get out of the game.

1354
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,400
I can't get out of the game.

1355
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,020
Quiet to see your message.

1356
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:02,780
Hold on.

1357
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,320
Okay, hold on.

1358
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,740
Let me do this and then I'll read it.

1359
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:08,560
I'm so sorry.

1360
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:10,640
Yeah.

1361
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,220
You just discovered a planet.

1362
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,580
Torgal, thank you for the pop content.

1363
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:18,540
Turn the toggles.

1364
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,360
Change the polarity filter by holding E.

1365
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,880
How do I know what it will look like?

1366
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,140
See, the value is changing.

1367
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:29,820
Yeah?

1368
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,300
But what do I change it to?

1369
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,660
Wait for the signal to be downloaded and detected abroad.

1370
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:35,500
Huh?

1371
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:36,840
What do I change it to?

1372
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:38,840
What do I do?

1373
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,840
What do I know what to change it to?

1374
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:40,860
What do I know what to change it to?

1375
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:52,870
Oh.

1376
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:55,090
Oh, it was changing.

1377
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,300
I was doing it.

1378
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,760
I thought these numbers were supposed to change.

1379
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:15,770
Um...

1380
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:17,590
Okay, it's right about...

1381
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:18,610
Right about there.

1382
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:20,130
That you know.

1383
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:25,490
This is actually a foolproof plan.

1384
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:27,350
To figure out.

1385
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:28,030
You just...

1386
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:28,550
You just...

1387
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:29,670
You just...

1388
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:30,270
Woohoo!

1389
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:31,630
And then, you know...

1390
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,150
As long as you keep holding E, you can look up at the screen.

1391
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:37,330
Okay, hold on.

1392
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:41,490
E!

1393
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,350
Wait, how do I stop it now?

1394
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:46,910
Wait.

1395
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,210
Actually, I don't know what's happening.

1396
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:54,030
Oh, wait.

1397
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:55,310
Oh.

1398
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:56,090
Huh?

1399
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,060
I see.

1400
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:06,140
Let's see.

1401
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,320
Let's write about...

1402
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,480
Write about...

1403
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:16,380
Ooh...

1404
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:19,560
Bee-bee.

1405
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:19,980
Oh.

1406
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:20,760
Beep.

1407
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,300
Aw, I missed it.

1408
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:26,220
Oh, no.

1409
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,120
Okay, hold on.

1410
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,800
I understand now.

1411
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:33,360
I understand, I understand.

1412
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,140
Bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee.

1413
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:36,780
Oh.

1414
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,320
Oh, I can go backwards.

1415
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,660
Okay, good to go.

1416
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,240
No, don't go backwards.

1417
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:43,880
Stop it.

1418
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,160
One.

1419
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,440
One polarity.

1420
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:57,400
It's going the slowest it's ever gone.

1421
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,300
No, I missed it again.

1422
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,520
Something just made a noise.

1423
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,180
Okay.

1424
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,060
Now we need the frequency.

1425
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,040
Oh.

1426
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,920
Oh, it's the same thing.

1427
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:34,480
Okay.

1428
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:36,340
Wait.

1429
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,940
It's a little different.

1430
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,140
It's a little different.

1431
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,700
Okay, okay, okay.

1432
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,940
Yeah, frequency doesn't loop.

1433
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:55,430
Okay, we're almost there.

1434
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:58,790
We're almost there.

1435
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:04,750
Incoming impact.

1436
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:05,990
In...

1437
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:13,070
So close.

1438
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:14,110
Oh.

1439
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:15,430
Yes.

1440
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:21,820
Okay, sorry.

1441
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,700
I accidentally just realized I'm muted on accent.

1442
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:28,570
Um...

1443
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:29,750
Mito, you are a treasure.

1444
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:32,850
Yohane, you are a nestle berry.

1445
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:35,090
Since tomorrow, we'll be streaming.

1446
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,070
Can I get a happy early...

1447
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:36,730
Early...

1448
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:37,410
Happy birthday.

1449
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:38,870
Golden Foxy!

1450
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:39,490
Happy birthday!

1451
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:43,590
My only wish is that volume 2 of MGS collection to be announced sooner.

1452
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:44,850
Maybe tomorrow.

1453
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,510
Wouldn't that be a great birthday wish?

1454
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:55,420
Gently, thank you so much for the...

1455
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,820
Super chat...

1456
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,040
Wait, I'm trying to read...

1457
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:58,800
From earlier.

1458
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,840
Small token of appreciation.

1459
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:02,540
Quiet Knight.

1460
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:03,320
Thank you!

1461
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,480
Thank you so much for the Akazuma.

1462
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:06,860
Thank you.

1463
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:07,880
I really appreciate it.

1464
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:09,920
Hold on.

1465
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,120
I'm gonna take a little cough drop.

1466
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:14,730
Da-ding.

1467
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:15,710
Oh.

1468
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:18,150
Okay.

1469
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:20,330
Now we continue.

1470
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:22,870
Oh.

1471
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,130
Uh, hello?

1472
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:25,590
Wait.

1473
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:28,110
There we go.

1474
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:29,690
I was like, I can't look around for some reason.

1475
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:30,590
Okay.

1476
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:35,350
Press the save button on the right of the filters.

1477
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,270
It will save the signal to the next panel.

1478
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:40,750
Save.

1479
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:44,430
Oh.

1480
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:48,410
That's today.

1481
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:51,110
Alright.

1482
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:54,610
Um.

1483
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:56,570
Playback panel.

1484
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:58,450
Saved signals are listed here.

1485
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:02,170
Use the play button on the very bottom left to listen to a signal.

1486
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:03,830
And adjust volume using the knobs.

1487
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:05,350
To the right.

1488
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:06,810
From the play button.

1489
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:10,370
MGS Volume 2.

1490
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:12,010
MGS4 on PC.

1491
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:12,870
I know.

1492
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:15,070
Me too.

1493
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:16,510
Alright.

1494
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:18,090
Uh.

1495
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:18,670
Okay.

1496
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:19,450
Let's play it.

1497
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,300
Raunchy.

1498
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,260
Um.

1499
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:47,260
We have to adjust the volume, I think.

1500
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,480
Where's the volume?

1501
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:51,560
Oh, here we go.

1502
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,440
Um.

1503
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:56,540
Um.

1504
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,460
What does that mean?

1505
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:00,380
Um.

1506
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:03,300
Um.

1507
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:04,640
The most...

1508
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,500
The bottom right button saves the signal to your computer.

1509
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:08,800
Hmm.

1510
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,120
Xbox mic.

1511
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:13,080
Yeah, the aliens.

1512
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:16,160
With their advanced technology.

1513
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:23,120
Even they can't escape having to get the Xbox mic from GameStop.

1514
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:30,330
A button to the right from the volume knob is the scroll.

1515
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,170
It allows you to scroll through the signal list.

1516
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:32,590
Okay.

1517
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:35,690
Visualization toggle.

1518
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:36,210
Okay.

1519
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:37,510
Um.

1520
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:45,030
When finished, insert a drive into the drive slot and press the orange export button.

1521
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,850
Do I have a drive?

1522
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:49,350
Canada!

1523
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,470
Oh, I do.

1524
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:00,420
Oops.

1525
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:01,800
There we go.

1526
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,360
Do you want fries with them?

1527
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:08,360
Um.

1528
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:11,420
Am I doing this right?

1529
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:13,860
Okay.

1530
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,020
Drives?

1531
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:21,060
Can then either be sold or processed further at the processing panel.

1532
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,360
Hold the drive over your hand, press L...

1533
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,400
L...

1534
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:24,440
L...

1535
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,820
My birthday was two weeks ago!

1536
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,040
Maple!

1537
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,460
Your birthday was two weeks ago and you didn't say anything to me?

1538
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,640
Why am I just hearing...

1539
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,240
Why did you...

1540
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,540
Why did you not say anything sooner?

1541
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:49,320
Go on the break!

1542
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,240
You were on break!

1543
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,800
You were gone!

1544
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:13,290
I was!

1545
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:14,190
Hahaha!

1546
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:22,710
Yeah, I was!

1547
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:25,530
Okay, let's rewind!

1548
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:30,330
Let's- Oh, but I got a new chair!

1549
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:31,590
It's really hard to get out of it.

1550
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:32,830
Oh, gosh.

1551
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:33,330
I'm gonna fall.

1552
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:38,290
Let's rewind.

1553
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:39,730
Two weeks ago.

1554
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:05,990
It's two weeks ago.

1555
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:15,320
What was I doing?

1556
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:15,880
Oh.

1557
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:21,280
Mabel, happy birthday!

1558
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,420
Today's your birthday!

1559
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:27,880
Oh, my gosh.

1560
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,880
It's such a good thing that I'm here.

1561
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,980
Yeah, it's your birthday today!

1562
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:35,500
It's such a good thing that I'm here.

1563
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,180
Hold on, Toma.

1564
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,060
We'll go back to the present in a second.

1565
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:44,380
I'm here to wish a happy birthday.

1566
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,420
Everybody else's birthday who also happened...

1567
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:50,860
The two weeks ago.

1568
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:53,800
And you know what?

1569
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:55,240
You know what?

1570
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,520
You know what, Mabel?

1571
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,360
I'm just gonna say this...

1572
01:12:59,240 --> 01:12:59,960
Out of...

1573
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,100
My own...

1574
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:01,600
Heart.

1575
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,580
Not because...

1576
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:06,040
A voice of the void told me.

1577
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,980
I don't need no alien.

1578
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:09,700
Oh, my gosh.

1579
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,540
Why is this starting to sound like a...

1580
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:12,920
Like a Hallmark card?

1581
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,820
I don't need no alien.

1582
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:15,800
I don't need no alien.

1583
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,460
To tell me.

1584
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,020
You're doing okay.

1585
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,860
You're out of this world.

1586
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,700
I don't need no alien.

1587
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,020
To tell me.

1588
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:37,860
You're...

1589
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:38,780
You're extraterrestrial.

1590
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:38,980
You're extraterrestrial.

1591
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,620
Now we have to go back...

1592
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:45,860
To the present.

1593
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:47,960
We do it.

1594
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:48,820
We do it.

1595
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:49,780
We do it.

1596
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:50,100
We do it.

1597
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:50,840
We do it.

1598
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:52,680
We do it.

1599
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:53,660
Oh.

1600
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,660
It's modern day.

1601
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,860
And I am tired.

1602
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,660
I am worn from the war.

1603
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,580
But, Toma, it was your birthday yesterday!

1604
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:03,980
Happy birthday!

1605
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,760
So much has happened in two weeks.

1606
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,200
So much has happened in two weeks.

1607
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:22,290
I'm not the same ghost I was two weeks ago.

1608
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,460
I'm not the same.

1609
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:41,730
Anyway.

1610
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:42,630
Anyway, okay.

1611
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:43,850
Let's get back to the game.

1612
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:44,950
Thank you, guys.

1613
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:48,130
Okay.

1614
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:56,410
Computer to purchase upgrades and items from the store, as well as other functions such as monitor cameras, check photos and emails, etc.

1615
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:59,310
This is what happens, you guys, when I take breaks from streaming, okay?

1616
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:02,990
I get too chatty, I think.

1617
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:07,250
I get so chatty.

1618
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:11,170
Usually, I'm pretty good about playing the game.

1619
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:14,050
Oh, sorry.

1620
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:14,370
My bad.

1621
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,830
There we go.

1622
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:17,270
Um, upgrades.

1623
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:20,370
Oh.

1624
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:29,680
Download speed.

1625
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:31,560
Whoa, whoa.

1626
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,960
It's my birthday tomorrow!

1627
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:34,780
Oh my gosh.

1628
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:35,940
Let's see American.

1629
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,100
Happy birthday!

1630
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,420
Happy early birthday.

1631
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:43,060
My birthday is the 28th of January.

1632
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:44,420
No!

1633
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,780
No, Phil, you are late.

1634
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,880
Thank you so much for the second time.

1635
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:56,480
So, I would have to sell that first though, no?

1636
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:02,140
Before I can... Why does it feel like it got so much darker?

1637
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,800
Oh, because my flashlight ran out of battery again.

1638
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,720
I need to stop using it, huh?

1639
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:08,460
For just whatever.

1640
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:12,220
Okay, now that I have this...

1641
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:13,700
Uh... Oh!

1642
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:14,260
Oops!

1643
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:15,400
Did I just break it?

1644
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:22,070
No, it's probably fine.

1645
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:24,350
It's probably okay.

1646
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:26,310
Wait, but now that I have...

1647
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:30,470
Oh, I can just go.

1648
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:34,310
It's so dark now though, I'm scared.

1649
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:37,350
Step four?

1650
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:38,510
Was there a step four?

1651
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:43,690
Oh!

1652
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:44,570
Here, here, here!

1653
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:45,090
Thank you!

1654
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:46,190
Oh my gosh, I missed a step.

1655
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:49,650
Come here, you!

1656
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:53,910
Uh, where do I stick you in?

1657
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:54,810
Stick it in!

1658
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:55,410
Nice.

1659
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:59,550
Plug the drive in with signal data and press import to export.

1660
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:01,090
To upload the data.

1661
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:02,690
Nice.

1662
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:06,010
Press the green button to begin the decoding process.

1663
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:06,510
Oh.

1664
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:08,190
Start.

1665
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:13,770
Once finished, press the button again to process another level.

1666
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:14,870
Max three.

1667
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:18,250
Press the red button to terminate the process if necessary.

1668
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:20,090
Why would it be necessary?

1669
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:25,410
When the process is done, press import export button again.

1670
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:25,490
Yeah.

1671
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,650
Okay, so we do it three...

1672
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:28,430
...times?

1673
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:30,130
It seems?

1674
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:35,530
Don't worry about it.

1675
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:36,990
Yeah, it's quite ominous, no?

1676
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:40,490
Terminate if necessary.

1677
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:42,110
Ha ha ha.

1678
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:45,110
I'm one of the devs...

1679
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:49,190
...for Voices of the Void head of Q&A Pure.

1680
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:50,810
Hope you're enjoying the game so far.

1681
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:51,670
Ha ha ha.

1682
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:52,350
Thank you!

1683
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:53,450
Ha ha ha.

1684
01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:56,190
Vesper, thank you for dropping by.

1685
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:58,970
Thank you, thank you!

1686
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:02,110
I'm still in this tutorial, as you can see, but I am...

1687
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:04,450
...quite having fun.

1688
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:07,030
Ha ha ha.

1689
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:10,030
Thank you, thank you!

1690
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:11,230
Ha ha.

1691
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:11,910
Oh.

1692
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:13,390
Okay, finished.

1693
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:14,850
Wait, so do I press it again?

1694
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:17,510
More, more, more.

1695
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,550
Up to three times.

1696
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:20,690
What does it do, though?

1697
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,550
Do you get more money?

1698
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:26,870
Or something?

1699
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:30,950
It cleans up the signal.

1700
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:31,370
Ah!

1701
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:34,550
I missed you.

1702
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:36,590
It's not my birthday.

1703
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:38,710
Could you please not wish me a happy birthday?

1704
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:40,390
I won't.

1705
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:44,950
It makes audio clearer and makes them worth more.

1706
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:45,490
Ha ha.

1707
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:47,230
I see, I see.

1708
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:48,710
Well...

1709
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:49,730
Uh...

1710
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:51,350
There's no reason to...

1711
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:52,590
To...

1712
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:53,910
To...

1713
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:55,430
Terminate it.

1714
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:56,730
I suppose.

1715
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:00,210
Someone's gonna come crashing through the ceiling, maybe.

1716
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:05,980
Money, money, money.

1717
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,560
Though I'm still really suspicious about hearing the...

1718
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,440
The walking around noises earlier.

1719
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,380
That really spooked me.

1720
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,040
Oh, finished.

1721
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:20,300
Okay.

1722
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,240
That really, really spooked me.

1723
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,020
Even clearer.

1724
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:35,630
It was just ambiance?

1725
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:39,990
Yeah.

1726
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:44,330
I feel like one of the guards in Metal Gear.

1727
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:45,610
What was that sound?

1728
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:47,710
Who's...

1729
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:49,010
Who's foot...

1730
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:50,370
Whose footprints are these?

1731
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:52,870
Whose foot steps were those?

1732
01:19:54,510 --> 01:19:56,630
You can play the signal after you process it.

1733
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:57,250
How?

1734
01:19:58,010 --> 01:19:59,430
How do I play it?

1735
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:06,230
Geronimo!

1736
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:07,650
Welcome to membership.

1737
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:08,330
Thank you!

1738
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:09,110
Thank you, thank you!

1739
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:10,810
What was that noise?

1740
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:12,490
That was literally me.

1741
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:15,010
Put it back.

1742
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:17,870
Stick it back in stage three.

1743
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:30,710
The ambiance in this game is scary.

1744
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:35,070
Play.

1745
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:38,390
Play?

1746
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:40,350
Oh, import.

1747
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:42,750
No?

1748
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:45,370
Oh, I didn't export it!

1749
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:46,690
Uh oh.

1750
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:48,050
Did I mess up?

1751
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:49,750
Is it gonna be broken?

1752
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:51,350
Wait.

1753
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:52,970
Stick it back in there.

1754
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:54,150
Oh, there we go.

1755
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:54,690
Export.

1756
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:03,190
No, you're good?

1757
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:03,430
Okay.

1758
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:05,890
How do I know when it's done exporting?

1759
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:06,850
Is that it?

1760
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:09,550
Oh, it does say level three.

1761
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:10,210
Okay, grab.

1762
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:12,970
Isn't it so convenient?

1763
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:14,910
I feel like a game like this...

1764
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:17,210
I feel like a game like this would be like...

1765
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:17,930
You know how...

1766
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:20,210
When you take out a USB on your computer...

1767
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:20,910
It's just like...

1768
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:22,070
Safely remove hardware?

1769
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:24,110
I feel like...

1770
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:25,690
I feel like...

1771
01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:27,970
I feel like they would want you to do something like that in a game like this.

1772
01:21:28,290 --> 01:21:30,210
It's my death day today.

1773
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:32,910
Chovac!

1774
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,350
How did you...

1775
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,290
Did you go to a psychic?

1776
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,190
Those are scams.

1777
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:43,870
Click.

1778
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,240
No text.

1779
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,260
Data.

1780
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:54,800
Detected.

1781
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:00,430
Nice.

1782
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:03,010
Okay.

1783
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:03,790
I finished.

1784
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:10,060
I guess it gives you the option to do the other ones.

1785
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,840
But since we've been here for an hour and a half...

1786
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:13,660
Now we're done?

1787
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:14,200
Cool.

1788
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,880
Does this place look familiar to you?

1789
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:35,260
Is it supposed to?

1790
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:40,010
Um...

1791
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:41,290
Oh no.

1792
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:43,370
Alien runes.

1793
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:45,350
Solve...

1794
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:51,430
Solve the...

1795
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:53,630
Math minigame.

1796
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:07,190
Wait a second.

1797
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:07,590
What?

1798
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:10,250
Solve the math minigame to fix a broken server.

1799
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:13,250
If the answer is more than 10, simply remove the 10th...

1800
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:14,750
10th's column.

1801
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:16,570
Example.

1802
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:17,570
1 plus 1 is 2.

1803
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:20,010
1 minus 2 is minus 1.

1804
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:20,770
A...

1805
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:25,330
A plus A is 16.

1806
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:28,130
Thankfully there's no one here to chase you with an axe.

1807
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:29,750
In case you get it wrong.

1808
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:32,950
I wish there was someone here to chase me with an axe.

1809
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:33,890
I got a crowbar.

1810
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:36,390
I've played Half-Life.

1811
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:37,030
I'm ready.

1812
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,600
That's a...

1813
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,240
What an odd thing to say.

1814
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,740
Wait, how do I do the...

1815
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:51,940
Repair.

1816
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:53,180
Repair.

1817
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:53,940
How do I do the math?

1818
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:55,540
Repair.

1819
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:56,440
Repair?

1820
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:01,300
Eh?

1821
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:08,210
I don't think that's how you repair it.

1822
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:10,950
Oh,

1823
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:18,030
they were working!

1824
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:20,050
Ah!

1825
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:23,960
Uh...

1826
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:24,740
Six...

1827
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:26,500
Four...

1828
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:28,500
Uh...

1829
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:29,720
Five...

1830
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,240
Minus six is minus one.

1831
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:32,540
How do I do the minus?

1832
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:35,200
How do I do the minus?

1833
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:37,220
Uh...

1834
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:38,660
Zero...

1835
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:41,300
Eight...

1836
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,240
Three...

1837
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:44,540
One...

1838
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,320
Six...

1839
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,580
Oh, it's just one.

1840
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:50,660
Zero...

1841
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,240
Wait, so...

1842
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:59,580
If the answer is more than ten, simply remove the tenths column.

1843
01:24:59,840 --> 01:24:59,960
Ah!

1844
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,300
Okay, okay, okay.

1845
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:02,960
I think I get that.

1846
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:05,760
Two...

1847
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:09,100
Nine...

1848
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:11,320
Three...

1849
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:13,640
One...

1850
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,380
Uh...

1851
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:14,560
Oh...

1852
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,560
Wait, so then if it's ten...

1853
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,060
I would just do one...

1854
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,080
I think?

1855
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:22,440
One...

1856
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:23,660
Oh...

1857
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:24,260
Nine...

1858
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:24,540
Ten...

1859
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:25,020
Eleven...

1860
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:25,720
Two...

1861
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:27,300
Oh, zero!

1862
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:29,400
Wait...

1863
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,100
How do I...

1864
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,120
How do I fix it?

1865
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:33,540
No, it's zero.

1866
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:34,440
Uh-oh.

1867
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:36,760
Exit.

1868
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,280
Redo...

1869
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:41,180
Zero...

1870
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:41,760
Seven...

1871
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:44,180
Okay, so if you remove the...

1872
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:46,160
So then it would be eight...

1873
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,760
Cause it's eighteen...

1874
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,760
Yeah, yeah...

1875
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:52,700
Uh...

1876
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,360
Six...

1877
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:57,240
Ten...

1878
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:59,200
One...

1879
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,220
Yes...

1880
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:02,300
One...

1881
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,220
Zero...

1882
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,100
Two...

1883
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,520
Servers will break down over time requiring maintenance.

1884
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:17,120
The two types of servers are...

1885
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:17,580
Base servers.

1886
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,260
These servers affect your signal processing speed.

1887
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:22,520
Satellite servers.

1888
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,460
These servers affect your signal download speed.

1889
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:29,340
Fixing a server will require solving several simple math problems.

1890
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:32,640
Okay, and reward you five points on a successful repair.

1891
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:37,320
This bonus does not apply to helpers fixing the server.

1892
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:38,440
Helpers?

1893
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:42,610
Pull...

1894
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:43,870
Three...

1895
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:46,710
Two...

1896
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:48,270
One...

1897
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:50,390
Zero...

1898
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:52,990
One...

1899
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:55,450
One...

1900
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:58,810
Four...

1901
01:26:58,810 --> 01:26:59,510
Uh...

1902
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:01,390
Three...

1903
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:03,570
One...

1904
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:09,990
Oh...

1905
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:12,210
They're just making silly server noises.

1906
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:14,810
What do they mean?

1907
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:16,430
Does this place look familiar to you?

1908
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:21,050
Wham for the server.

1909
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:22,630
Oh, dedicated wham.

1910
01:27:24,130 --> 01:27:24,530
Yes.

1911
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:27,110
Four...

1912
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:29,490
Four...

1913
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:31,890
Zero...

1914
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:33,470
Two...

1915
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:35,130
One...

1916
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:35,610
Right?

1917
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:36,370
Yeah.

1918
01:27:38,430 --> 01:27:39,110
Six...

1919
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:42,250
Two...

1920
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:44,090
Two...

1921
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:45,810
Why'd it make that sound?

1922
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:50,550
I thought I saw some funny lights.

1923
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:54,550
Okay.

1924
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:57,590
Oh, dual record time!

1925
01:27:59,250 --> 01:27:59,970
Cool.

1926
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:01,970
Just server things.

1927
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:02,610
Okay, what's this?

1928
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:10,390
Using the console, you can perform different commands like pinging antenna servers, checking satellite calibration, compass, targeting, etc.

1929
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:13,370
You can find a list of commands on the right of the console screen.

1930
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:14,370
Oh...

1931
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:16,770
Oh...

1932
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:17,870
Oh...

1933
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:21,810
I didn't know I needed to know how to code for this game.

1934
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:25,610
Um...

1935
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:30,410
Uh...

1936
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:31,770
Oh...

1937
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:32,750
Pink...

1938
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:43,440
Pink...

1939
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:48,100
RDS filter type shows radar entities by type.

1940
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:52,140
S...

1941
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:52,380
S...

1942
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:52,480
S...

1943
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:52,500
S...

1944
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:52,540
S...

1945
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:52,600
S...

1946
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,720
Toggle...邀...

1947
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:11,550
Yeah... S...

1948
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:12,650
Set target coordinates.

1949
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:13,570
Clear screen.

1950
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:17,990
So now... They're...

1951
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:18,550
Oh...

1952
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:20,510
Oh, never mind.

1953
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:21,950
They're actually still pretty noisy.

1954
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:26,290
Breaker box.

1955
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:29,330
The breaker box controls the power of five different components.

1956
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:34,210
Each one consumes a portion of energy and slows down the rest of the component's performance.

1957
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:39,730
If you need to speed up the downloading or processing, turn off the components you don't use.

1958
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:42,630
Breaker components can also be controlled from the PC.

1959
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:44,110
Check components tab.

1960
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:49,790
Components tab?

1961
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:51,990
Or is this the command?

1962
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:53,330
Is this not the PC PC?

1963
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,780
I don't have my flashlight anymore.

1964
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:04,700
It's a little spooky.

1965
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,240
I don't have it equipped?

1966
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:34,040
Oh, I guess you're right, because I have... wait.

1967
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,140
No, but it was working earlier.

1968
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:47,090
Uh... okay.

1969
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:49,770
Oh.

1970
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:52,830
Bright and sunny day!

1971
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:57,510
Transformers keep the base powered.

1972
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:00,450
And you will need to be... and will need to be monitored.

1973
01:31:00,710 --> 01:31:03,470
When one of the transformers reaches zero power will be cut off from the base.

1974
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:05,070
And the transformer will require maintenance.

1975
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:06,690
To fix a transformer...

1976
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,210
Simple press the big red button.

1977
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:13,670
Transformers can be reset even while active.

1978
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:17,890
What's this?

1979
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:19,750
Wait.

1980
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:21,490
What's that?

1981
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:28,080
Can I grab it?

1982
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:29,980
Wait, what is that?

1983
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:45,640
It has to be that way.

1984
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,180
It has to be that way.

1985
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,000
Why?

1986
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:54,100
Oh!

1987
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:00,180
Oopsie.

1988
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,340
I'll press C.

1989
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:05,920
Instead of, uh, control.

1990
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:09,300
But you can't uncrouch here, I guess.

1991
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,580
Because I was trying to jump.

1992
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:21,640
I was trying to jump up so I can go maybe go out of bounds.

1993
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:23,400
Hmm.

1994
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:24,760
Cryptic, huh?

1995
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:27,680
Very cryptic.

1996
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:29,980
Congratulations!

1997
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:33,380
You have completed the Voices of the Void tutorial and are ready to begin your assignment.

1998
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,860
Remember there are many more gameplay elements to discover.

1999
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,840
Far too many to cover in a single tutorial.

2000
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:38,720
Have fun!

2001
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:40,800
Jump into the hole to complete the tutorial.

2002
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,360
That's it?

2003
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:49,950
Si!

2004
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:57,370
Yeah, they didn't go over that mechanic.

2005
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:02,870
Why do I need to play dead?

2006
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:05,910
Okay!

2007
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:06,970
Whee!

2008
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:11,970
Quit.

2009
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:23,990
I got a bone!

2010
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:25,890
I got a bone!

2011
01:33:25,890 --> 01:33:26,750
I got a bone to pick with you!

2012
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:39,020
I want all the bones.

2013
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:43,480
Is that really?

2014
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:44,660
Yeah, I just gotta quit the game.

2015
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:13,440
I think I got them all.

2016
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:16,920
Sneaky!

2017
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:17,240
Thank you!

2018
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:19,940
I think I got them all.

2019
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:26,260
Whoa!

2020
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:30,400
Oh!

2021
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:34,300
If you press C there, it takes you back to the beginning!

2022
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:43,570
Is that what it means by a gameplay loop?

2023
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:48,100
Oh!

2024
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:48,980
Oh!

2025
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:57,140
Oh, oh, oh!

2026
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,120
Turn around, inspect the tiles.

2027
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,820
And this one sells these ones?

2028
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:11,400
What is that?

2029
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:14,640
Dot dot dot.

2030
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:17,660
There's so many little secrets even just in the tutorial.

2031
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,660
Just craziness.

2032
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:22,980
Holy cow.

2033
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:23,560
Oof.

2034
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,040
Alright, anyway.

2035
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:28,800
Menu?

2036
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:57,460
This song is so awesome.

2037
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:07,260
I... I... I'm really big on... Game menu music.

2038
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:10,700
That, like, really set a tone for a game.

2039
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:15,600
Like, title music.

2040
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:17,280
This one?

2041
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:21,380
Like, MGS... MGS2?

2042
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:22,760
Weedy!

2043
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:25,800
Thank you for the gifted...

2044
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,240
Outer Wilds.

2045
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:31,480
You know, they all, like, just totally set, like...

2046
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:32,960
They're just like, wow.

2047
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:35,300
Yeah, it's so awesome.

2048
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,100
It's just so awesome.

2049
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:38,160
Okay.

2050
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:39,700
I guess I'll start.

2051
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,340
I'm scared.

2052
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:45,360
Story.

2053
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,500
I think I know story related.

2054
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:50,040
No, no.

2055
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:50,880
I want the story.

2056
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:53,460
Congrats.

2057
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:57,180
You are now Forklift Space Antenna Certified.

2058
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:58,480
There was a lot of info to learn.

2059
01:36:58,600 --> 01:36:59,240
I will be...

2060
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,840
I will be relying on you guys.

2061
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:03,840
Probably, if that's okay.

2062
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:09,300
Start day one out of seven.

2063
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,720
What in the FNAF is this?

2064
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:17,440
Hello?

2065
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:18,800
Oh.

2066
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:20,600
Me too.

2067
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:27,030
Play the...

2068
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:29,110
Wait.

2069
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:30,030
What's the difference?

2070
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:32,050
What's the matter?

2071
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,360
Just signed to buy my first home.

2072
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:40,380
Oh my gosh, Danavis!

2073
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:40,880
Congratulations!

2074
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:43,820
Oh, whoa.

2075
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:46,520
Okay.

2076
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:48,620
Clean...

2077
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:50,480
Uh, press escape to pause the game.

2078
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:51,960
How to...

2079
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:52,660
Oh gosh.

2080
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:53,400
Pause.

2081
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:54,520
Binds.

2082
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:55,320
Pause.

2083
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:55,700
Save.

2084
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:56,260
Progress.

2085
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:57,200
F5.

2086
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:57,840
Quick save.

2087
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:01,060
F6 to quick save as backup.

2088
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:01,960
Oh, interesting.

2089
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:02,900
Additional game.

2090
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:03,540
Place.

2091
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,200
Difficulty options and settings.

2092
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:08,880
Uh...

2093
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:09,820
Custom content.

2094
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,000
Experience.

2095
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:11,460
Fun stuff.

2096
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,400
Funny setting.

2097
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:12,820
Ah!

2098
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:14,760
Not recommended for the first playthrough.

2099
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:21,340
You guys told me to turn it on.

2100
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,400
Toilet paper...

2101
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:29,660
Marie...

2102
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:30,180
Watery...

2103
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:33,720
Certificate...

2104
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:35,360
Cal Joy plush.

2105
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:44,290
Toy boy!

2106
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:46,330
How do I get in there?

2107
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:48,510
Oh, come on.

2108
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:50,230
Walls don't stop me.

2109
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:51,850
What is that?

2110
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:56,010
Actually, this place is kind of a dump.

2111
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:58,870
Wait...

2112
01:39:00,730 --> 01:39:02,190
But actually, this is...

2113
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:03,610
Um...

2114
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:04,230
Kinda horrible.

2115
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,080
Wow, it's dark.

2116
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:18,480
Oh wait, I was gonna say not the moon in the sky.

2117
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:19,860
But there it is, teeny tiny.

2118
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:21,580
Base.

2119
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:25,600
All your base.

2120
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:29,360
All my base.

2121
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:29,900
Is there...

2122
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:31,080
Oh, there is stamina in this game.

2123
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,060
I was about to say, is there stamina in this game?

2124
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,360
Yeah, it was only in the tutorial.

2125
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,640
That I just played.

2126
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,320
Hour and a half of.

2127
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:43,260
My suitcase.

2128
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:46,760
But I took everything from it.

2129
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:53,920
I don't need it anymore.

2130
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:55,580
I got the stuff out of it.

2131
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:00,140
Oh, it's free storage.

2132
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,280
I guess so, okay.

2133
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,120
Okay, okay.

2134
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,300
Uh, collect.

2135
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:08,720
Not enough space.

2136
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:12,000
I'll hold it.

2137
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:27,220
Why didn't I arrive at daytime?

2138
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:33,320
Is there a way to know how much battery my flashlight has?

2139
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,140
Is it...

2140
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:35,600
In the bottom right?

2141
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:36,960
Am I covering it currently?

2142
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,080
Oh, top right.

2143
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,200
Oh, I see, I see.

2144
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:42,580
Thank you, thank you.

2145
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:44,120
Oh!

2146
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,560
I didn't see who righted, but thank you!

2147
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:48,980
Thank you so much.

2148
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:49,620
Gate.

2149
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:51,540
What's that?

2150
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:53,000
It's a little sticker.

2151
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,300
Is this my base?

2152
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:56,780
Or is this my base?

2153
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:01,380
Or is this my base?

2154
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:01,740
Caution.

2155
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:03,620
Uh...

2156
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:05,060
A lovely lady alone.

2157
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:06,280
Check him out.

2158
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,440
Is this my base?

2159
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:11,560
Or is that my base?

2160
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:20,430
Not the bridge.

2161
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:20,730
Okay.

2162
01:41:20,730 --> 01:41:20,810
Why?

2163
01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:22,050
Tis himself.

2164
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:23,290
Thank you so much for the tag gift.

2165
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:24,130
Thank you!

2166
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:25,590
Thank you so much!

2167
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:30,510
All your base are belong to us.

2168
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:34,590
Classic internet...

2169
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:35,390
Meme.

2170
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:45,300
Classic...

2171
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:50,430
There shouldn't be anything spooky.

2172
01:41:50,590 --> 01:41:50,790
I...

2173
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:52,710
I haven't contacted a single alien.

2174
01:41:58,890 --> 01:41:59,790
Oh, sorry.

2175
01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:01,390
There was so much on the supertot.

2176
01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:02,850
I couldn't tell.

2177
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:03,370
I...

2178
01:42:03,370 --> 01:42:04,550
I only kind of skimmed it.

2179
01:42:04,610 --> 01:42:06,510
Cause I couldn't tell if it was a spoiler or not.

2180
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:07,550
Um...

2181
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:08,090
But thank you!

2182
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:11,770
What's this?

2183
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:13,830
Base...

2184
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:14,650
Gate...

2185
01:42:14,650 --> 01:42:15,410
Whiskey!

2186
01:42:19,130 --> 01:42:19,990
What's this mean?

2187
01:42:26,490 --> 01:42:26,970
Uh...

2188
01:42:26,970 --> 01:42:29,270
Is that a watch out for wildlife sign?

2189
01:42:32,270 --> 01:42:32,750
Wait...

2190
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:34,090
Oh, whiskey is this way.

2191
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:35,130
I got all turned around.

2192
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:36,990
What the heck is this?

2193
01:42:38,910 --> 01:42:40,590
Oh, maybe the aliens are here.

2194
01:42:41,790 --> 01:42:43,050
Can I go to whiskey?

2195
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:46,150
What does a whiskey taste like?

2196
01:42:50,850 --> 01:42:52,110
Go to base first.

2197
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:55,390
I wanna explore...

2198
01:42:57,030 --> 01:42:59,270
But I feel like this is maybe...

2199
01:42:59,270 --> 01:43:00,930
I can't do anything until I go to the base?

2200
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:05,370
I have no space left in my inventory anyway.

2201
01:43:10,170 --> 01:43:10,690
Uh...

2202
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:12,270
I'm just gonna keep going up.

2203
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:16,690
There's so many intel...

2204
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:17,790
This is huge!

2205
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:20,790
This is actually...

2206
01:43:20,790 --> 01:43:22,590
Really large...

2207
01:43:24,050 --> 01:43:24,570
Land.

2208
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:29,500
Base is important.

2209
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:29,840
Okay.

2210
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:35,440
If there wasn't creepy music, this would be so...

2211
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:37,700
Relaxing.

2212
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:40,460
This would be so...

2213
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:42,160
This would be my ideal kind of walk.

2214
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,400
I love taking night walks.

2215
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:46,280
How...

2216
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:49,940
It never fails to impress me how fluid and expressive your bottle is.

2217
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:51,640
It's really cute whenever you dance around.

2218
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:54,520
Thank you!

2219
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:57,740
I'm always wiggling.

2220
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:00,740
Is this my base?

2221
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:01,520
No.

2222
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:08,320
Another pillar.

2223
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,820
How mysterious.

2224
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:11,740
Is it?

2225
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:12,940
It says...

2226
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:13,560
Go to whiskey.

2227
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,160
Go to whiskey!

2228
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:19,740
I take a vitamin every day.

2229
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:22,980
I can't say it normally.

2230
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:28,100
I have no space left in my inventory for you to put all our travel supplies in your pockets.

2231
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,000
Another whiskey!

2232
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:30,980
Whiskey pillar!

2233
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:33,220
But I take this vitamin.

2234
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:34,740
And I can't...

2235
01:44:34,740 --> 01:44:35,240
Even if I...

2236
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:37,700
When I tell you, I won't be able to tell you normally.

2237
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:39,980
I will have to tell you...

2238
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:43,460
Also, sorry if I'm moving around very erratically.

2239
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:46,040
I hope I don't give you emotion sick.

2240
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:47,760
Um...

2241
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:50,520
But basically, it's called go to cola.

2242
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,320
I take that.

2243
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:58,600
And I'm always like, I gotta take my go to cola.

2244
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:03,340
I could take these.

2245
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:08,480
India!

2246
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:09,160
Hotel!

2247
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:10,480
Juliet!

2248
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:11,480
I could...

2249
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:12,760
There's a girl on this...

2250
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:13,260
Base?

2251
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:15,440
Base.

2252
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:17,780
But this is this way though.

2253
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:18,360
It doesn't...

2254
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:19,780
It doesn't point to...

2255
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:21,260
It keeps telling me to go to whiskey.

2256
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:25,620
Wow, wow, thank you!

2257
01:45:37,410 --> 01:45:38,610
This is...

2258
01:45:38,610 --> 01:45:39,770
What is this place?

2259
01:45:42,010 --> 01:45:43,170
A rock.

2260
01:45:44,650 --> 01:45:46,010
Is this my base?

2261
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:51,680
It's my base!

2262
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:54,340
We're home?

2263
01:45:59,950 --> 01:46:01,590
Wine, wine, wine, wine.

2264
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:06,770
There better not be any, like, government secrets here.

2265
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:10,850
I'm gonna store all my...

2266
01:46:10,850 --> 01:46:12,850
All my supplies in the mailbox.

2267
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:18,790
Is this just a bunch of garbage?

2268
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:21,250
This place needs a cleanup.

2269
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:22,230
What's this one?

2270
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:25,530
Aw...

2271
01:46:25,530 --> 01:46:26,330
Oops.

2272
01:46:27,870 --> 01:46:28,690
Clear, clear.

2273
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:29,190
Cancel.

2274
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:32,110
Wine, wine, wine, wine.

2275
01:46:33,730 --> 01:46:34,450
Dang it.

2276
01:46:35,410 --> 01:46:37,370
That's just covered in...

2277
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:38,650
Garbage!

2278
01:46:39,110 --> 01:46:41,010
Oh gosh, this place is gross!

2279
01:46:43,510 --> 01:46:45,550
Why are they allowing me to stay here?

2280
01:46:48,190 --> 01:46:48,950
There...

2281
01:46:50,530 --> 01:46:51,730
Oh no!

2282
01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:54,030
I don't like that.

2283
01:46:58,090 --> 01:46:58,850
Okay.

2284
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:04,920
There wasn't something there, was there?

2285
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:09,120
Or...

2286
01:47:21,090 --> 01:47:22,250
Was that something there?

2287
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:24,190
Or...

2288
01:47:24,910 --> 01:47:25,350
No.

2289
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:30,660
Hang in there.

2290
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:32,200
Classic.

2291
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:34,080
How do I...

2292
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,360
Maybe a breaker somewhere?

2293
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:40,620
Why did it save?

2294
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:44,180
Holy cannoli!

2295
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:49,120
One, two, three, four, pass.

2296
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:53,080
Hi dog!

2297
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:55,860
Headcanon...

2298
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:56,560
Oh no!

2299
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:58,640
Wait, I can't really read?

2300
01:47:58,980 --> 01:47:59,980
This... I thought...

2301
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:02,080
Forget the cyber truck.

2302
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:03,680
We got the cyber bike here.

2303
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:07,500
What was it?

2304
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:08,300
One, two, three, four?

2305
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:11,100
Okay, um...

2306
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:15,920
Break room.

2307
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,540
Oh, not break room!

2308
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:19,740
Not breaker room!

2309
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:20,380
Oh no!

2310
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,380
Wait, there's just drives on the ground!

2311
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:25,400
Why is this place in such disrepair?

2312
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:25,860
What is this place in such disrepair?

2313
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:47,920
There was one...

2314
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,080
There's a few that are down.

2315
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:50,000
I know how to math.

2316
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:53,400
Oh my goodness.

2317
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:55,080
Lights switch by the door.

2318
01:48:55,580 --> 01:48:56,560
Oh wait, it works!

2319
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:59,120
Oh my goodness.

2320
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:02,120
I thought the lights didn't work at all in this place.

2321
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:06,260
340.

2322
01:49:09,870 --> 01:49:10,590
Ugh!

2323
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:16,120
Take?

2324
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:17,080
What am I taking?

2325
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:19,380
Oh!

2326
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:20,500
Oops.

2327
01:49:21,620 --> 01:49:21,980
Uh...

2328
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:23,520
Put it on the wall.

2329
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:26,820
Oopsie.

2330
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:28,820
Uh...

2331
01:49:33,490 --> 01:49:33,950
Uh...

2332
01:49:33,950 --> 01:49:34,990
Put it back.

2333
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:39,050
You flipped on the outside light at the front door.

2334
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:39,870
No...

2335
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:40,430
Kidding?

2336
01:49:40,630 --> 01:49:41,590
Is that what I did?

2337
01:49:48,530 --> 01:49:49,490
Wake up girls!

2338
01:49:52,910 --> 01:49:54,090
And there's a second...

2339
01:49:54,090 --> 01:49:55,320
Oh, this is such a cute mural.

2340
01:49:56,010 --> 01:49:58,610
Wait, this place seems like it was so cute at one point.

2341
01:49:59,490 --> 01:49:59,790
No?

2342
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:03,910
Can we clean it up?

2343
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:19,550
Oh...

2344
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:20,950
Gosh...

2345
01:50:21,390 --> 01:50:27,250
I keep monitoring my flashlight because that really freaked me out when I turned it back on and I saw something moving in here.

2346
01:50:27,570 --> 01:50:28,590
Or thought...

2347
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:29,610
This...

2348
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:31,870
Administration...

2349
01:50:34,450 --> 01:50:36,170
Wait, but where are the lights then?

2350
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:36,790
In here?

2351
01:50:39,710 --> 01:50:41,910
I don't like the mannequins.

2352
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:43,830
Perfect for a maid.

2353
01:50:43,970 --> 01:50:45,010
Did I get...

2354
01:50:45,010 --> 01:50:46,730
Tricked into playing...

2355
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:48,210
Half-Life...

2356
01:50:48,210 --> 01:50:49,010
Cleaning Simulator?

2357
01:50:52,410 --> 01:50:53,530
Did I get tricked?

2358
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,820
Love the garbage clipping through the ceiling.

2359
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:02,380
It really just shows how...

2360
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:04,640
How nasty this place is.

2361
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:10,620
Where...

2362
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:11,800
Where's the light switch?

2363
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:12,740
Am I...

2364
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:13,080
Blind?

2365
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:15,480
You think it's behind some crates?

2366
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:21,860
Slowly?

2367
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:25,240
It's in the admin.

2368
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:29,180
Oh, I think I have to go through the garage.

2369
01:51:35,610 --> 01:51:36,650
Uh...

2370
01:51:36,650 --> 01:51:37,530
One...

2371
01:51:37,530 --> 01:51:38,610
Two...

2372
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:39,510
Three...

2373
01:51:39,510 --> 01:51:40,910
Four...

2374
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:46,070
Uh...

2375
01:51:46,070 --> 01:51:47,330
Oh, there's some MRAs in here too.

2376
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:50,250
Ah...

2377
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:52,430
Let there be light!

2378
01:51:52,630 --> 01:51:53,470
Car keys!

2379
01:51:54,030 --> 01:51:54,550
Oops...

2380
01:51:55,010 --> 01:51:55,530
Uh...

2381
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:56,110
Uh...

2382
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:56,270
Uh...

2383
01:51:56,270 --> 01:51:56,530
Let's collect.

2384
01:52:00,230 --> 01:52:01,790
Baboozle twice in one day?

2385
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:03,350
Oh!

2386
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:05,830
Oh!

2387
01:52:07,030 --> 01:52:08,370
Maybe that's what I saw.

2388
01:52:09,130 --> 01:52:10,630
And it fell over.

2389
01:52:11,450 --> 01:52:13,790
Oh, that did not turn on the lights out there.

2390
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:15,210
Oh, here we go.

2391
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:19,950
Ah...

2392
01:52:21,310 --> 01:52:21,870
Okay.

2393
01:52:22,990 --> 01:52:24,070
Oh, and a battery.

2394
01:52:25,190 --> 01:52:25,750
We'll...

2395
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:26,390
Collect that.

2396
01:52:30,330 --> 01:52:31,450
More batteries!

2397
01:52:31,790 --> 01:52:32,010
Okay.

2398
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:33,470
Very good, very good.

2399
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:34,630
We'll just collect all of them.

2400
01:52:37,990 --> 01:52:39,510
Why do I feel like the...

2401
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:41,650
The power can go out at any moment?

2402
01:52:41,910 --> 01:52:42,290
Ugh...

2403
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:42,710
Scary.

2404
01:52:44,710 --> 01:52:45,690
Med kit?

2405
01:52:47,290 --> 01:52:47,930
Use!

2406
01:52:48,290 --> 01:52:49,230
Heal wounds?

2407
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:49,910
Uh-oh.

2408
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:52,310
I need...

2409
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:53,670
I need...

2410
01:52:53,670 --> 01:52:55,130
A metal pipe!

2411
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:05,650
It'll be interesting to check out the vine later on.

2412
01:53:05,710 --> 01:53:05,990
Take care.

2413
01:53:06,090 --> 01:53:07,490
I also try not to let him in.

2414
01:53:14,620 --> 01:53:15,260
Him?

2415
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:23,100
Him?

2416
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:26,320
Him.

2417
01:53:32,050 --> 01:53:33,870
I don't know why...

2418
01:53:33,870 --> 01:53:38,230
I know it's faceless, but it looked like it was looking at me from down here.

2419
01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:39,910
Is this the delivery?

2420
01:53:40,950 --> 01:53:41,630
Spot?

2421
01:53:42,210 --> 01:53:42,890
Grab.

2422
01:53:43,290 --> 01:53:43,930
Maybe not.

2423
01:53:46,330 --> 01:53:46,670
What?

2424
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:49,570
I think the sun's coming up.

2425
01:53:54,430 --> 01:53:56,770
Delivery drone and then...

2426
01:53:56,770 --> 01:53:57,470
To somewhere.

2427
01:54:00,210 --> 01:54:01,370
It's an elevator?

2428
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:03,990
Oh, maybe.

2429
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:10,730
So I guess we gotta start...

2430
01:54:10,730 --> 01:54:12,130
Deciphering from...

2431
01:54:12,130 --> 01:54:12,850
Some signals.

2432
01:54:13,110 --> 01:54:14,870
But I wanna look around a little bit more first.

2433
01:54:15,630 --> 01:54:17,130
I'm exploring my home.

2434
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:17,870
Oh, wow!

2435
01:54:19,570 --> 01:54:20,090
Wow!

2436
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:22,510
Oh my gosh!

2437
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:23,370
This view!

2438
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:25,690
I like the view.

2439
01:54:25,690 --> 01:54:26,450
What?

2440
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:37,340
Nothing.

2441
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:38,480
Nothing in here.

2442
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:41,900
I covered my eyes.

2443
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:45,940
Wow, that's a lot of fire extinguishers.

2444
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:48,560
Oh my god.

2445
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:53,120
Oh!

2446
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,320
This is where the elevator goes to.

2447
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:58,220
Wow, there's so many drives in here.

2448
01:54:58,340 --> 01:54:58,540
Okay.

2449
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:00,660
We gotta get to work, baby!

2450
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:06,640
Why are there...

2451
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:07,880
Drives in the kitchen?

2452
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:11,800
Oh, they're empty.

2453
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:14,040
Oh, that's right!

2454
01:55:14,060 --> 01:55:17,520
It did say that we, um...

2455
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:21,580
It did say that, uh...

2456
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:26,040
Heating stuff up would make it be more nutritious.

2457
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:27,700
It's just a dummy, dummy.

2458
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:31,920
Is that a ghost?

2459
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:39,980
Organic trash.

2460
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:47,120
I will eat the banana.

2461
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:48,700
Actually...

2462
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:50,660
Shut...

2463
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:51,780
Shut it!

2464
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:52,860
Shut it, please!

2465
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:55,100
Close the door!

2466
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:57,580
Uh...

2467
01:55:57,580 --> 01:55:58,160
Wait, there we go.

2468
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,280
Oh, this is like their beds and everything.

2469
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:03,820
Day one Monday.

2470
01:56:07,870 --> 01:56:08,890
Oh, there it is.

2471
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:11,170
It's...

2472
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:17,680
8...

2473
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:18,640
F...

2474
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:18,700
50.

2475
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:22,300
I...

2476
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:23,940
Believe...

2477
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:27,840
Oh, that must be what the actual spaceships look like...

2478
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:30,160
Paper.

2479
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:32,100
Paper.

2480
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:38,840
Wash your filthy hands!

2481
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:46,340
I'm not gonna lie.

2482
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,900
It looks awfully fresh.

2483
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:54,460
It looks awfully fresh.

2484
01:57:00,370 --> 01:57:01,490
Would you?

2485
01:57:01,650 --> 01:57:03,970
You wouldn't catch me in this place.

2486
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:05,710
Would you?

2487
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:17,640
So pretty!

2488
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:19,280
Wait, there was a basement, too.

2489
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:21,020
Or there was a downstairs, rather.

2490
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,720
My flashlight is... uh... dropping significantly.

2491
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:34,620
Use.

2492
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:44,660
Use the battery.

2493
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:48,060
How do I use?

2494
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:49,320
Gosh, I forgot.

2495
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:51,000
Oh, let's just go back upstairs.

2496
01:57:58,740 --> 01:58:00,720
Is this like the music it plays at dawn?

2497
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:06,060
When the sun is... hold and right click.

2498
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:15,160
Uh...

2499
01:58:15,160 --> 01:58:15,720
Where is it?

2500
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:17,140
Hold...

2501
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:19,460
Right click.

2502
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:20,060
Eh?

2503
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:22,940
Oh, yeah.

2504
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:23,640
My suitcase.

2505
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:25,260
I forgot I was holding it this whole time.

2506
01:58:33,140 --> 01:58:33,620
Whoa...

2507
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:34,400
Freaky.

2508
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:36,260
How do I get onto... this part?

2509
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:50,720
The kitchen.

2510
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:51,280
The kitchen.

2511
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:52,380
Oh, I see, I see.

2512
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:56,040
Um...

2513
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:58,560
I noticed her stamina is at 60.

2514
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:04,220
Okay, time to remember everything that we learned... before.

2515
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:06,280
I guess.

2516
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:09,020
Oh, that's my notepad.

2517
01:59:09,180 --> 01:59:10,420
Okay, there's nothing written in there.

2518
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:14,180
I can't work under these conditions.

2519
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:15,680
I just wanna clean!

2520
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:17,240
What is this?

2521
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:20,140
Drive port.

2522
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:22,280
Oh, we can clear the drive.

2523
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:22,900
Interesting.

2524
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:29,820
Let's...

2525
01:59:31,580 --> 01:59:32,100
Let's...

2526
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:33,760
Ex... Oh, there we... there we go.

2527
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:36,320
There's one right so close.

2528
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:41,260
Binging.

2529
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:43,400
Invalid object.

2530
01:59:52,470 --> 01:59:53,690
Quickscan is on cooldown.

2531
01:59:54,290 --> 01:59:56,250
That didn't exist in the tutorial.

2532
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:00,670
Still?

2533
02:00:01,650 --> 02:00:03,950
Oh, wow, the cooldown is really...

2534
02:00:03,950 --> 02:00:05,010
Okay, we'll just keep going then.

2535
02:00:11,110 --> 02:00:11,850
That was long.

2536
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:13,470
Sorry, my cursor just...

2537
02:00:15,950 --> 02:00:16,630
Cool.

2538
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:30,520
It's okay, I don't need it.

2539
02:00:30,980 --> 02:00:31,780
Ping, ping.

2540
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:37,020
Ping failed.

2541
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:42,380
Is that a dead pixel?

2542
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:43,220
This right here?

2543
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:46,020
I was... I was noticing that too.

2544
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:51,480
Okay.

2545
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:54,060
Alright.

2546
02:00:56,260 --> 02:00:56,940
Ping!

2547
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:57,600
Oh!

2548
02:00:58,840 --> 02:00:59,320
Everywhere.

2549
02:01:04,070 --> 02:01:05,250
Wish I could go faster.

2550
02:01:06,030 --> 02:01:06,270
Oh!

2551
02:01:06,630 --> 02:01:07,130
That's a ping.

2552
02:01:07,330 --> 02:01:07,490
Alright.

2553
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:08,270
That's a scan.

2554
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:30,500
Oh!

2555
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:31,440
How?

2556
02:01:33,580 --> 02:01:34,780
How did I miss it?

2557
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:36,500
Let's just go down and see if we can find...

2558
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:40,120
Whatever's down here.

2559
02:01:46,790 --> 02:01:47,270
Anything?

2560
02:01:48,510 --> 02:01:49,030
Oh!

2561
02:01:49,290 --> 02:01:49,870
I hit the...

2562
02:01:49,870 --> 02:01:50,530
The ground!

2563
02:01:51,890 --> 02:01:53,150
Hit the ground running.

2564
02:01:53,470 --> 02:01:55,170
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-de-bobie-boo.

2565
02:01:55,290 --> 02:01:57,430
Bee-boo-babida-bee-boo-boo.

2566
02:01:58,070 --> 02:01:59,510
Bee-boo-bababdi-bee-boo-boo.

2567
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:02,110
Bee-boob-babibi-ba-ba-ba-Boob-bada-bop-Bee-boo-bee-de-bee-bough.

2568
02:02:03,330 --> 02:02:04,910
How am I missing that?

2569
02:02:14,950 --> 02:02:16,930
I caught the first one so easily.

2570
02:02:19,770 --> 02:02:20,510
Oh!

2571
02:02:20,990 --> 02:02:22,770
I just noticed my food, too.

2572
02:02:23,490 --> 02:02:28,130
Wait, remain behind the blast shield while machine is operating.

2573
02:02:30,870 --> 02:02:38,990
Cosmic gulfs... Cosmic gulfs it throws open before our frenzied eyes.

2574
02:02:39,950 --> 02:02:40,490
What?

2575
02:02:44,410 --> 02:02:45,850
Monotone man, happy birthday!

2576
02:02:47,410 --> 02:02:49,130
We gotta get some MRE.

2577
02:02:49,370 --> 02:02:49,950
Oh, wow!

2578
02:02:50,170 --> 02:02:50,710
Shower!

2579
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:55,190
Emergency shower...

2580
02:02:55,190 --> 02:02:56,990
As opposed to...

2581
02:03:10,410 --> 02:03:12,450
I wish I could put this back up.

2582
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:13,170
Is there a way to?

2583
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:18,480
Radar...

2584
02:03:21,410 --> 02:03:23,830
Is this... Is this me?

2585
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:42,740
Huh?

2586
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:45,280
Huh?

2587
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:49,480
I think I'm gonna turn that off.

2588
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:52,340
Please?

2589
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:54,320
I don't wanna see it anymore.

2590
02:03:58,260 --> 02:04:00,680
There's something... There's... Um...

2591
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:02,600
I don't wanna... I don't wanna...

2592
02:04:04,780 --> 02:04:08,420
I don't wanna shock anybody, but, um...

2593
02:04:08,420 --> 02:04:10,840
There's more than one dot here.

2594
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:26,840
There's... That one's far.

2595
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:47,580
We gotta get some food.

2596
02:04:47,860 --> 02:04:49,400
Wait, I have food on me.

2597
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:51,960
Shoot.

2598
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:54,840
MRE.

2599
02:05:00,970 --> 02:05:02,970
Okay, we're at 70 now.

2600
02:05:08,630 --> 02:05:09,850
Wait, no.

2601
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:13,740
Collect.

2602
02:05:14,360 --> 02:05:17,540
How do I put... Sorry, I keep... I'm gonna keep asking this.

2603
02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:20,440
How do I put away stuff that I have in my bar to recollect?

2604
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:20,660
Ah!

2605
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:22,900
Thank you.

2606
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:25,140
Okay, let's continue searching.

2607
02:05:25,820 --> 02:05:27,560
My stamina is still okay, maybe.

2608
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:28,840
Oh.

2609
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:32,980
Wait, this one's straight down.

2610
02:05:36,620 --> 02:05:37,380
We're here.

2611
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:38,040
I found it.

2612
02:05:40,060 --> 02:05:41,500
Please, please, please.

2613
02:05:46,180 --> 02:05:48,080
Girl, do not look behind you.

2614
02:05:48,220 --> 02:05:49,100
Don't say that.

2615
02:05:52,250 --> 02:05:53,590
Don't say that.

2616
02:06:08,140 --> 02:06:10,640
How much does Mito know about this game?

2617
02:06:11,380 --> 02:06:12,340
Virtually nothing.

2618
02:06:13,620 --> 02:06:15,020
I know very nothing.

2619
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:16,680
I know the tutorial.

2620
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:18,740
Please.

2621
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:22,420
Oh my gosh.

2622
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:22,720
Okay.

2623
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:28,480
I forgot what to do.

2624
02:06:33,940 --> 02:06:34,420
Wait.

2625
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:38,440
Here.

2626
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:39,600
Here, here, here, here.

2627
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:43,660
Here, here, here, here, here.

2628
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:44,800
Okay, I'll remember now.

2629
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:47,200
Why

2630
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:53,820
isn't it moving?

2631
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:01,990
Is it foggy?

2632
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:06,680
Yeah.

2633
02:07:08,060 --> 02:07:09,240
The red button.

2634
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:11,300
Oh.

2635
02:07:13,220 --> 02:07:14,020
What's a button?

2636
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:15,280
Wait.

2637
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:17,100
Red button.

2638
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:32,380
No, not delete signal.

2639
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:40,660
Saved.

2640
02:07:41,540 --> 02:07:42,520
Scares me every time.

2641
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:45,400
The two switches.

2642
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:46,900
This?

2643
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:50,020
That's right.

2644
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:52,300
Okay, I was looking for a red button, you guys.

2645
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:53,220
Oh, wow, it's fast.

2646
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:53,720
Okay, hold on.

2647
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:56,400
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta turn that down.

2648
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:01,240
Uh, let's see.

2649
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:02,400
Okay.

2650
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:03,900
Wait.

2651
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:04,560
No, just kidding.

2652
02:08:14,060 --> 02:08:14,500
Oh, wait.

2653
02:08:14,700 --> 02:08:15,360
Ah, buh, buh, buh, buh.

2654
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:18,140
Go back?

2655
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:21,660
What's a good range to get it in?

2656
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:30,080
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2657
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:30,560
I messed up.

2658
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:31,100
I messed it.

2659
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:37,060
Top two bars?

2660
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:39,920
Wait, I, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

2661
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:41,380
I messed it again.

2662
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:42,840
Okay.

2663
02:08:43,180 --> 02:08:45,180
I don't think it goes any way higher.

2664
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:47,760
Okay.

2665
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:51,890
And then, this guy.

2666
02:08:56,540 --> 02:08:57,560
Oh, oh, oh.

2667
02:08:58,300 --> 02:08:59,340
Okay, we messed it.

2668
02:09:01,020 --> 02:09:02,320
Oh, we messed it again.

2669
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:10,140
Okay, good enough.

2670
02:09:10,420 --> 02:09:11,360
Good, good enough.

2671
02:09:25,690 --> 02:09:26,890
Okay, save.

2672
02:09:29,390 --> 02:09:31,130
I don't like the thunder.

2673
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:36,790
Doesn't work.

2674
02:09:37,450 --> 02:09:39,990
I gotta go get a drive, don't I?

2675
02:09:51,630 --> 02:09:52,230
Paper.

2676
02:09:54,210 --> 02:09:56,910
But it's downloading, right?

2677
02:09:57,090 --> 02:09:59,450
Or what is... downloading, yeah.

2678
02:09:59,590 --> 02:10:00,550
Oh gosh, it's so slow.

2679
02:10:05,250 --> 02:10:06,610
Who's getting closer?

2680
02:10:07,450 --> 02:10:09,050
No, he's still so far.

2681
02:10:09,330 --> 02:10:11,270
He's still the same length away.

2682
02:10:12,890 --> 02:10:13,810
I think.

2683
02:10:20,010 --> 02:10:23,730
They wouldn't have anything too evil happen on the first day, right?

2684
02:10:26,270 --> 02:10:27,990
Where do I sleep at?

2685
02:10:33,250 --> 02:10:34,710
Like, where can I go to sleep?

2686
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:41,970
Kitchen room.

2687
02:10:45,510 --> 02:10:46,410
Upstairs, okay.

2688
02:10:47,870 --> 02:10:48,190
Okay.

2689
02:11:01,330 --> 02:11:03,030
It was, uh, not that room.

2690
02:11:03,390 --> 02:11:03,690
This one.

2691
02:11:05,430 --> 02:11:07,630
Thank you so much for the 20th, thank you!

2692
02:11:08,770 --> 02:11:10,450
Oh, and there's lots of drives here too.

2693
02:11:12,030 --> 02:11:13,990
We'll collect a con- a couple of these.

2694
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:17,830
Don't I need the paper too, to like...

2695
02:11:20,950 --> 02:11:21,370
Um...

2696
02:11:21,370 --> 02:11:23,730
Don't I need paper also, to...

2697
02:11:23,730 --> 02:11:24,590
Do these stack?

2698
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:25,790
I should also check.

2699
02:11:26,470 --> 02:11:27,410
Okay, good, they do.

2700
02:11:29,230 --> 02:11:29,650
Um...

2701
02:11:29,650 --> 02:11:31,590
Because I need it for the drives, right?

2702
02:11:31,590 --> 02:11:32,390
And this too.

2703
02:11:33,590 --> 02:11:34,770
Not enough space.

2704
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:35,390
Dang it.

2705
02:11:35,390 --> 02:11:35,730
Okay.

2706
02:11:36,170 --> 02:11:36,730
Um...

2707
02:11:36,730 --> 02:11:37,790
Oh, here's my bed!

2708
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:39,430
Here's?

2709
02:11:45,490 --> 02:11:46,050
Oh.

2710
02:11:47,730 --> 02:11:49,230
This is...

2711
02:11:49,230 --> 02:11:50,230
Peaceful.

2712
02:11:53,090 --> 02:11:53,650
Hmm.

2713
02:11:56,250 --> 02:11:57,530
Yeah, this is nice!

2714
02:11:58,950 --> 02:11:59,450
Yeah.

2715
02:12:01,690 --> 02:12:03,370
Oh, okay.

2716
02:12:04,670 --> 02:12:07,530
And then the creepy ambiance happens again.

2717
02:12:09,130 --> 02:12:09,710
Save, okay.

2718
02:12:12,510 --> 02:12:13,290
Cool.

2719
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:14,630
What time is it?

2720
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:19,580
1.30.

2721
02:12:26,310 --> 02:12:27,670
Oh, here it is.

2722
02:12:29,330 --> 02:12:30,110
Wow.

2723
02:12:30,110 --> 02:12:30,450
Wow.

2724
02:12:32,070 --> 02:12:33,810
And it stopped raining.

2725
02:12:35,070 --> 02:12:35,630
Lucky.

2726
02:12:36,690 --> 02:12:38,110
What's in here?

2727
02:12:39,690 --> 02:12:40,810
Can't open.

2728
02:12:43,230 --> 02:12:44,690
It's messed up.

2729
02:12:49,350 --> 02:12:50,410
Oh.

2730
02:12:50,890 --> 02:12:51,570
Oh.

2731
02:12:52,630 --> 02:12:53,150
Oh.

2732
02:12:58,010 --> 02:13:00,550
Why is it pointed at the sun?

2733
02:13:01,730 --> 02:13:02,790
Is X to zoom?

2734
02:13:02,850 --> 02:13:03,690
How do I zoom in this?

2735
02:13:04,990 --> 02:13:05,710
Won't let me.

2736
02:13:11,290 --> 02:13:13,950
See, it's so calming and nice right now.

2737
02:13:15,990 --> 02:13:16,410
Okay.

2738
02:13:16,590 --> 02:13:17,710
Maybe things aren't so bad.

2739
02:13:23,540 --> 02:13:24,860
That guy was always in there.

2740
02:13:24,980 --> 02:13:25,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2741
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:25,780
Okay.

2742
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:29,420
Maybe I should shut the door.

2743
02:13:31,780 --> 02:13:32,440
Close the door.

2744
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:33,240
Okay.

2745
02:13:39,700 --> 02:13:41,980
What's the ambiance for?

2746
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:45,700
Why is it so much more ambiance than before?

2747
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:52,840
Okay.

2748
02:13:52,840 --> 02:13:52,960
Okay.

2749
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:56,800
It's still not done downloading.

2750
02:13:59,480 --> 02:14:00,780
No kidding.

2751
02:14:00,820 --> 02:14:02,120
There was a drive right here.

2752
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:08,200
Wow.

2753
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:11,060
It's really slow.

2754
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:13,880
Oh.

2755
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:13,940
Um.

2756
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:16,840
Oh, I just realized there's a computer.

2757
02:14:17,260 --> 02:14:17,600
Turn on.

2758
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:19,300
Activate.

2759
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:20,060
Ah.

2760
02:14:20,380 --> 02:14:20,600
Oh.

2761
02:14:28,580 --> 02:14:30,200
Oh, that's right.

2762
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:31,240
Email.

2763
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:32,940
Hi.

2764
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:34,260
Hello.

2765
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:35,680
I am Dr. Bao.

2766
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:36,360
Oh, no.

2767
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:41,300
They wouldn't let her get a degree, would they?

2768
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:44,900
I will be responsible for your daily tasks.

2769
02:14:46,420 --> 02:14:50,000
In short, I will ask you to do a quick task at the start of every day.

2770
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:50,700
Oh.

2771
02:14:51,060 --> 02:14:53,440
First, I will request a specific amount of drives.

2772
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:58,960
These can range from level zero drives to level three.

2773
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:02,800
I understand your situation.

2774
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:07,900
However, I will not request a drive you can't obtain.

2775
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:11,480
The second task I will ask of you is a simple satellite checkup.

2776
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:12,700
Go to the satellite.

2777
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:17,520
Type in sv.hash into the server and write down the server and number in a note.

2778
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,060
For example, bravo.

2779
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:26,960
Once you've done that, put it inside the drive box and send it off with the drone.

2780
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:29,280
I've left a little notebook on the table.

2781
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:31,020
You can tear some pages out for notes.

2782
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:31,320
You are.

2783
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:35,280
No free, thank you!

2784
02:15:35,660 --> 02:15:37,860
Top or bottom bunk, me though.

2785
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:39,640
Top bunk.

2786
02:15:41,620 --> 02:15:42,260
Top.

2787
02:15:42,700 --> 02:15:43,320
Bunk.

2788
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:46,420
Cause I was always afraid...

2789
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:47,460
I didn't have a bunk bed.

2790
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:49,180
But I was always afraid that...

2791
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:51,700
That...

2792
02:15:51,700 --> 02:15:54,480
What if the top bunk fell on me?

2793
02:15:54,980 --> 02:15:55,520
You know?

2794
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:55,680
Oh!

2795
02:16:00,030 --> 02:16:02,710
But also, it was so cool to just be like...

2796
02:16:02,710 --> 02:16:03,550
High up.

2797
02:16:06,610 --> 02:16:08,990
Once you've done that, put it inside the drive box and send it off.

2798
02:16:09,130 --> 02:16:09,830
I've left a notebook.

2799
02:16:10,110 --> 02:16:13,590
As usual, you will get a nice point bonus if you complete these for me.

2800
02:16:13,790 --> 02:16:16,370
Have a nice day and night wherever you are, Dr. Bao.

2801
02:16:17,450 --> 02:16:18,010
Welcome.

2802
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:20,730
Welcome to your new job, Dr. Kell.

2803
02:16:21,330 --> 02:16:22,170
My name is Leah.

2804
02:16:22,730 --> 02:16:24,170
Your main supervisor.

2805
02:16:24,510 --> 02:16:26,930
You've probably got through the learning period.

2806
02:16:26,970 --> 02:16:30,390
But I'll remind you what your job is and what to do.

2807
02:16:30,810 --> 02:16:34,770
In short, your job is basically scanning the sky for anomalous signals.

2808
02:16:35,590 --> 02:16:37,010
That is your main task.

2809
02:16:37,130 --> 02:16:40,510
Did I get duped into playing an anomaly game?

2810
02:16:44,610 --> 02:16:45,850
That is your main task.

2811
02:16:45,970 --> 02:16:52,030
Another task is to process the data of these signals and send us the data stored on analog drives.

2812
02:16:52,390 --> 02:16:54,730
You will get a reward for each drive.

2813
02:16:54,730 --> 02:16:58,430
And if you process the signal on further levels, you will get more points.

2814
02:16:58,870 --> 02:17:02,790
Next task is to look after these big satellite dishes.

2815
02:17:03,850 --> 02:17:05,630
Hit servers and calibration.

2816
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:10,170
You can recalibrate satellites remotely through the console panel.

2817
02:17:10,350 --> 02:17:14,750
But if the satellite server shuts down, you have to manually fix it.

2818
02:17:14,850 --> 02:17:16,330
The server is inside the satellites.

2819
02:17:16,930 --> 02:17:18,150
Alright, I think that is it.

2820
02:17:18,530 --> 02:17:22,110
The nuclear reactor is not implemented yet.

2821
02:17:22,830 --> 02:17:25,350
So you don't need to worry about that.

2822
02:17:25,830 --> 02:17:29,330
Gather the signals, process them, sell results to us.

2823
02:17:29,530 --> 02:17:31,550
Look after the satellites, that's it.

2824
02:17:31,550 --> 02:17:33,150
Good luck, Professor Leah.

2825
02:17:35,270 --> 02:17:36,510
Okay.

2826
02:17:40,870 --> 02:17:42,110
80%.

2827
02:17:42,110 --> 02:17:44,290
I guess we can, um...

2828
02:17:45,070 --> 02:17:46,590
Fix some of these.

2829
02:17:47,490 --> 02:17:48,330
Right?

2830
02:17:49,190 --> 02:17:49,490
Eight.

2831
02:17:50,570 --> 02:17:51,810
One.

2832
02:17:53,010 --> 02:17:53,870
One.

2833
02:17:54,490 --> 02:17:55,110
Nine.

2834
02:17:55,730 --> 02:17:56,250
Eight.

2835
02:17:56,950 --> 02:17:57,690
Six.

2836
02:17:58,430 --> 02:17:58,890
Eight.

2837
02:17:59,270 --> 02:18:00,130
Zero.

2838
02:18:02,330 --> 02:18:03,250
Sounds...

2839
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:04,290
Perfectly safe.

2840
02:18:04,530 --> 02:18:04,970
Yes.

2841
02:18:06,010 --> 02:18:06,510
Okay.

2842
02:18:07,130 --> 02:18:08,890
Yeah, sounds...

2843
02:18:09,410 --> 02:18:09,870
Perfectly...

2844
02:18:09,870 --> 02:18:11,410
Oh, this is where the console is too.

2845
02:18:11,790 --> 02:18:14,090
Which they wanted me to...

2846
02:18:14,690 --> 02:18:15,530
Type...

2847
02:18:15,530 --> 02:18:16,150
Something.

2848
02:18:17,410 --> 02:18:18,310
Six.

2849
02:18:18,470 --> 02:18:19,010
Oh, six.

2850
02:18:19,530 --> 02:18:20,010
Four.

2851
02:18:20,730 --> 02:18:21,350
Two.

2852
02:18:21,350 --> 02:18:22,250
Oh.

2853
02:18:22,610 --> 02:18:23,430
Five.

2854
02:18:23,810 --> 02:18:24,230
Fifteen.

2855
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:25,630
Uh...

2856
02:18:25,630 --> 02:18:26,070
Two.

2857
02:18:26,550 --> 02:18:27,070
Five.

2858
02:18:29,950 --> 02:18:30,990
Four.

2859
02:18:32,090 --> 02:18:32,770
Six.

2860
02:18:37,290 --> 02:18:37,810
Okay.

2861
02:18:40,930 --> 02:18:42,570
I don't like the sound of them.

2862
02:18:42,570 --> 02:18:42,590
One.

2863
02:18:45,790 --> 02:18:46,890
Thank you for the claps.

2864
02:18:46,990 --> 02:18:47,450
Thank you!

2865
02:18:50,090 --> 02:18:50,490
Um...

2866
02:18:50,490 --> 02:18:51,490
They wanted me to...

2867
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:52,190
Hold on, I'll check.

2868
02:18:54,370 --> 02:18:55,150
What was it?

2869
02:18:57,690 --> 02:18:58,450
One.

2870
02:18:59,110 --> 02:18:59,250
Two.

2871
02:19:00,210 --> 02:19:00,330
Two.

2872
02:19:00,710 --> 02:19:00,850
Two.

2873
02:19:01,130 --> 02:19:01,190
Two.

2874
02:19:01,190 --> 02:19:01,610
Uh...

2875
02:19:01,610 --> 02:19:02,610
S-V dot hush.

2876
02:19:03,290 --> 02:19:03,630
Okay.

2877
02:19:36,180 --> 02:19:37,440
Don't go, Taylor.

2878
02:19:53,980 --> 02:19:54,740
There...

2879
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:56,620
There's a little...

2880
02:20:00,380 --> 02:20:02,060
Are my eyes deceiving me?

2881
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:03,680
Or did I see a tiny red dot?

2882
02:20:03,980 --> 02:20:04,780
Wait, it's gone.

2883
02:20:12,290 --> 02:20:13,510
The dot that was up there.

2884
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:14,230
Wait, it's...

2885
02:20:14,230 --> 02:20:14,970
It's still there.

2886
02:20:15,270 --> 02:20:16,150
Just very...

2887
02:20:16,150 --> 02:20:17,050
Very tiny.

2888
02:20:17,550 --> 02:20:18,130
You see it?

2889
02:20:19,790 --> 02:20:21,030
Why is it so tiny?

2890
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:32,990
It's like very...

2891
02:20:32,990 --> 02:20:33,270
What?

2892
02:20:35,350 --> 02:20:35,870
Huh?

2893
02:20:36,650 --> 02:20:37,890
You guys didn't see it?

2894
02:20:51,790 --> 02:20:53,450
Oh, it was my crosshair!

2895
02:21:03,930 --> 02:21:04,870
What was that?

2896
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:11,340
Something growled.

2897
02:21:14,780 --> 02:21:16,540
Oh, my tummy.

2898
02:21:24,220 --> 02:21:24,740
Hold.

2899
02:21:33,570 --> 02:21:35,550
What happens if I run out of food?

2900
02:21:37,610 --> 02:21:38,130
Curious.

2901
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:44,180
I wanna start getting rid of all...

2902
02:21:44,180 --> 02:21:44,860
Wait, this might...

2903
02:21:44,860 --> 02:21:45,800
It's probably done by now.

2904
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:47,540
Oh, so close!

2905
02:21:47,780 --> 02:21:47,880
Okay.

2906
02:21:51,300 --> 02:21:52,700
It's behind you.

2907
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:53,820
No, it's not!

2908
02:21:55,900 --> 02:21:57,700
With two dots in the center.

2909
02:21:57,940 --> 02:21:59,380
Yeah, that's the most curious part.

2910
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:03,040
McBag, thank you so much for the gift.

2911
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:03,380
Dude!

2912
02:22:04,020 --> 02:22:06,080
You can buy more on the PC...

2913
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:07,600
Store.

2914
02:22:09,880 --> 02:22:11,300
How much do I have?

2915
02:22:11,660 --> 02:22:13,440
I don't even know how much money I've got.

2916
02:22:14,720 --> 02:22:15,880
Camera bad.

2917
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:17,120
Camera bad.

2918
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:17,640
Camera good.

2919
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:19,800
Sleeping bag.

2920
02:22:20,100 --> 02:22:23,000
So I could always sleep here and never have to leave the room?

2921
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:26,280
Top left?

2922
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:27,800
So I have 15 points?

2923
02:22:32,200 --> 02:22:32,540
Glasses.

2924
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:34,480
Crank flashlight.

2925
02:22:34,480 --> 02:22:34,660
Crank flashlight.

2926
02:22:35,300 --> 02:22:35,420
Oh!

2927
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:39,680
Uh...

2928
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:40,620
Decoration!

2929
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:44,720
A vase with feet.

2930
02:22:47,320 --> 02:22:48,920
Well, that's a lot of potted plants.

2931
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:51,140
Why does this look like a slab of meat?

2932
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,720
Cool, funny, Sweden man.

2933
02:22:56,960 --> 02:22:58,300
Real, no fake.

2934
02:22:59,180 --> 02:23:05,220
Thank you for your great streams.

2935
02:23:05,860 --> 02:23:06,560
Who's that?

2936
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:11,800
IDP award plushie, the legend.

2937
02:23:12,460 --> 02:23:14,480
Pushed voices of the void to the masses.

2938
02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:16,160
Cool!

2939
02:23:17,660 --> 02:23:18,460
Whoa!

2940
02:23:18,460 --> 02:23:19,860
We could get glow sticks.

2941
02:23:22,420 --> 02:23:23,260
It's done!

2942
02:23:25,400 --> 02:23:26,240
Wait a second.

2943
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:27,000
Uh...

2944
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:27,400
Save.

2945
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:28,140
There we go.

2946
02:23:29,240 --> 02:23:29,800
Yippee!

2947
02:23:38,380 --> 02:23:39,740
Oh, volume at zero.

2948
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:44,980
There we go.

2949
02:23:55,150 --> 02:23:55,710
Nice.

2950
02:23:55,970 --> 02:23:56,590
Good channel.

2951
02:23:57,570 --> 02:23:59,030
What do I do here again?

2952
02:23:59,030 --> 02:23:59,690
Um...

2953
02:24:02,770 --> 02:24:03,250
Uh...

2954
02:24:03,250 --> 02:24:04,110
Does it keep...

2955
02:24:04,110 --> 02:24:05,450
Does it need to keep going to load?

2956
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:14,080
Import.

2957
02:24:15,480 --> 02:24:16,460
Oh, that's alright.

2958
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:17,280
Thank you.

2959
02:24:17,700 --> 02:24:18,780
Alright, so now...

2960
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:20,400
We take you...

2961
02:24:20,980 --> 02:24:22,180
And we put you in here.

2962
02:24:25,060 --> 02:24:25,540
Wait...

2963
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:27,240
There we go.

2964
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:29,540
And then we...

2965
02:24:30,660 --> 02:24:31,740
And then we...

2966
02:24:37,710 --> 02:24:39,080
And then we...

2967
02:24:41,270 --> 02:24:42,050
Uh...

2968
02:24:42,050 --> 02:24:43,510
Vinto Xbox mic stream.

2969
02:24:44,810 --> 02:24:46,950
I don't have processing yet.

2970
02:24:47,190 --> 02:24:47,790
What do you mean?

2971
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:49,150
It's right here.

2972
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:00,680
I can't do it?

2973
02:25:01,900 --> 02:25:02,340
I can't do it?

2974
02:25:02,340 --> 02:25:03,540
You have to earn it?

2975
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:05,280
So what do I do with this now?

2976
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:07,000
I just put it in the...

2977
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:07,400
In here?

2978
02:25:12,980 --> 02:25:14,360
Sell it as is.

2979
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:14,860
I see.

2980
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:15,400
Okay.

2981
02:25:15,400 --> 02:25:16,000
I...

2982
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:16,700
Rock fighter.

2983
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:17,840
Thank you so much for the...

2984
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:19,240
Tag gift and thank you.

2985
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:22,060
Put drive.

2986
02:25:22,560 --> 02:25:23,020
Yes.

2987
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:25,380
Put drive.

2988
02:25:26,720 --> 02:25:27,400
Uh...

2989
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:28,700
Maybe...

2990
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:29,860
Oops.

2991
02:25:31,580 --> 02:25:33,320
It's probably fine.

2992
02:25:34,580 --> 02:25:35,180
Grab.

2993
02:25:35,900 --> 02:25:36,820
Grab it.

2994
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:37,880
Grab.

2995
02:25:38,660 --> 02:25:40,160
Sun's going down, you guys.

2996
02:25:40,360 --> 02:25:41,160
What time is it?

2997
02:25:41,580 --> 02:25:42,000
Okay.

2998
02:25:42,260 --> 02:25:42,920
We got a time.

2999
02:25:44,420 --> 02:25:45,720
Red is empty.

3000
02:25:45,980 --> 02:25:46,900
Wait, what happened to it?

3001
02:25:55,090 --> 02:25:56,240
It had something though.

3002
02:25:58,010 --> 02:25:59,400
I left it in the processor.

3003
02:25:59,880 --> 02:25:59,900
Oh.

3004
02:26:06,290 --> 02:26:06,990
Ah...

3005
02:26:06,990 --> 02:26:07,250
Okay.

3006
02:26:10,230 --> 02:26:10,930
Yippee!

3007
02:26:16,690 --> 02:26:18,190
We did it.

3008
02:26:27,330 --> 02:26:28,630
Part of vine sauce.

3009
02:26:31,370 --> 02:26:32,070
Oh...

3010
02:26:33,410 --> 02:26:34,390
I see.

3011
02:26:37,230 --> 02:26:38,790
Should we try and find another?

3012
02:26:39,370 --> 02:26:40,010
Ooh.

3013
02:26:41,930 --> 02:26:43,630
Or should I just go to sleep?

3014
02:26:48,740 --> 02:26:49,060
Hmm...

3015
02:26:49,380 --> 02:26:50,440
Friends with Laimu.

3016
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:51,780
Yeah!

3017
02:26:52,780 --> 02:26:54,220
I love Laimu.

3018
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:56,680
Oops.

3019
02:26:56,980 --> 02:26:58,020
I forgot there was a cooldown.

3020
02:27:02,470 --> 02:27:04,950
I could sleep while it's processing.

3021
02:27:05,270 --> 02:27:06,730
I just gotta find a thing first.

3022
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:13,420
I'm just gonna keep going right.

3023
02:27:28,580 --> 02:27:29,640
What's that sound?

3024
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:31,680
You guys hear that?

3025
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:32,380
It's very faint.

3026
02:27:46,060 --> 02:27:47,340
You guys hear that though, right?

3027
02:27:52,500 --> 02:27:53,220
You guys hear that though, right?

3028
02:27:54,980 --> 02:27:55,340
Uh...

3029
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:00,740
Just music?

3030
02:28:01,020 --> 02:28:01,200
Okay.

3031
02:28:01,620 --> 02:28:02,440
Oh, my flashlight.

3032
02:28:02,740 --> 02:28:03,820
Is that 17%?

3033
02:28:09,010 --> 02:28:09,370
Uh...

3034
02:28:09,790 --> 02:28:11,430
Wait, how do I get it over here again?

3035
02:28:11,510 --> 02:28:11,970
Oh, here...

3036
02:28:13,190 --> 02:28:13,930
Oh, there it is.

3037
02:28:14,010 --> 02:28:14,170
Okay.

3038
02:28:14,170 --> 02:28:15,470
It's gotta...

3039
02:28:15,470 --> 02:28:15,810
It's gotta...

3040
02:28:15,810 --> 02:28:16,530
It's gotta take a minute.

3041
02:28:23,640 --> 02:28:26,160
It's not even seven.

3042
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,180
Just the wind.

3043
02:28:31,420 --> 02:28:31,820
Yeah.

3044
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:38,770
Okay.

3045
02:28:41,030 --> 02:28:42,510
What's that music?

3046
02:29:11,220 --> 02:29:11,980
Let's...

3047
02:29:11,980 --> 02:29:12,920
Let's just be jammed.

3048
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:13,780
Okay.

3049
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:16,780
If you say so.

3050
02:29:24,280 --> 02:29:25,620
It's music coming from...

3051
02:29:26,220 --> 02:29:27,220
A creature.

3052
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:29,900
I wonder where that dot went.

3053
02:29:31,380 --> 02:29:34,380
Why is the music so ominous though?

3054
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:36,240
Why is it so horrible?

3055
02:29:37,460 --> 02:29:38,780
Okay, here we go.

3056
02:29:42,140 --> 02:29:42,660
Oh.

3057
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:43,800
Okay.

3058
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:49,300
Ooh...

3059
02:29:55,470 --> 02:29:56,690
Wait, did it go up?

3060
02:29:57,990 --> 02:29:58,970
Did I miss it?

3061
02:30:05,330 --> 02:30:05,850
What?

3062
02:30:08,470 --> 02:30:09,430
Wait, oh.

3063
02:30:18,940 --> 02:30:20,140
Try a different polarity?

3064
02:30:23,860 --> 02:30:25,200
Oh, wait, like this one?

3065
02:30:25,460 --> 02:30:26,060
Ah, okay.

3066
02:30:34,070 --> 02:30:34,590
Oh.

3067
02:30:43,470 --> 02:30:43,710
Oh.

3068
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:53,960
There we go.

3069
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:56,500
I like concentrate.

3070
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:57,560
So much.

3071
02:31:02,340 --> 02:31:02,860
Ah.

3072
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:04,220
It was at a hundred.

3073
02:31:05,060 --> 02:31:05,560
There we go.

3074
02:31:06,320 --> 02:31:06,800
Okay.

3075
02:31:06,900 --> 02:31:08,400
It's fluctuating a little bit, but that's all right.

3076
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:10,560
Okay.

3077
02:31:10,780 --> 02:31:11,080
And you.

3078
02:31:23,110 --> 02:31:23,890
Uh-huh.

3079
02:31:25,970 --> 02:31:26,770
Uh-huh.

3080
02:31:28,970 --> 02:31:29,890
Uh-huh.

3081
02:31:32,350 --> 02:31:33,110
Uh-huh.

3082
02:31:34,370 --> 02:31:35,050
Uh-huh.

3083
02:31:35,050 --> 02:31:35,210
Uh-huh.

3084
02:31:36,550 --> 02:31:36,790
Uh-huh.

3085
02:31:36,790 --> 02:31:37,310
Uh-huh.

3086
02:31:37,310 --> 02:31:38,430
Uh-huh.

3087
02:31:41,350 --> 02:31:41,850
Oh!

3088
02:31:41,850 --> 02:31:42,630
Did you see it?

3089
02:31:43,490 --> 02:31:44,450
Oh, wait.

3090
02:31:44,590 --> 02:31:45,170
I lost it.

3091
02:31:45,250 --> 02:31:45,630
Oh, no.

3092
02:31:45,750 --> 02:31:46,470
I lost it again.

3093
02:31:46,630 --> 02:31:47,430
Oh, it's gone.

3094
02:31:49,090 --> 02:31:49,850
What was that?

3095
02:31:53,260 --> 02:31:54,220
What was that?

3096
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:08,640
Oh, shoot.

3097
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:09,960
Oh, shoot.

3098
02:32:14,610 --> 02:32:15,990
Wait, which way was it?

3099
02:32:17,690 --> 02:32:18,570
I don't know.

3100
02:32:18,810 --> 02:32:20,270
I didn't see what number it was.

3101
02:32:20,490 --> 02:32:22,170
The detector is done detecting.

3102
02:32:22,710 --> 02:32:23,610
Oh, I see.

3103
02:32:24,870 --> 02:32:25,510
Which way?

3104
02:32:28,110 --> 02:32:29,070
950-ish?

3105
02:32:31,750 --> 02:32:32,810
Wrong.

3106
02:32:33,330 --> 02:32:33,670
Wrong.

3107
02:32:34,230 --> 02:32:34,770
Higher?

3108
02:32:35,890 --> 02:32:36,430
Ah!

3109
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:42,980
Okay.

3110
02:32:43,420 --> 02:32:44,660
I think that should be it.

3111
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:45,020
Okay.

3112
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:46,220
Ooh!

3113
02:32:49,130 --> 02:32:49,660
Save.

3114
02:32:51,160 --> 02:32:52,220
Save?

3115
02:32:54,070 --> 02:32:55,260
Why isn't it saving?

3116
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:03,100
Do I need to clear the data here or something?

3117
02:33:03,860 --> 02:33:05,280
I gotta download it.

3118
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:06,240
Oh!

3119
02:33:06,380 --> 02:33:06,860
I forgot.

3120
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:09,660
I forgot that it takes a million years to download.

3121
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:11,920
Shall we go sleep?

3122
02:33:14,600 --> 02:33:14,960
Oops.

3123
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:16,080
Oops.

3124
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:17,280
Oops.

3125
02:33:24,760 --> 02:33:26,580
My stamina's at 42.

3126
02:33:27,800 --> 02:33:29,880
We could probably sleep until...

3127
02:33:31,240 --> 02:33:32,640
The morning?

3128
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:37,180
No.

3129
02:33:44,630 --> 02:33:46,530
What does the red 4 mean?

3130
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:04,780
It used to be 3.

3131
02:34:07,510 --> 02:34:09,020
But it's back down to 3.

3132
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:11,140
So all is good.

3133
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:14,380
All is okay!

3134
02:34:27,450 --> 02:34:29,830
We'll clean in the morning...

3135
02:34:32,650 --> 02:34:33,090
Ahh...

3136
02:34:33,090 --> 02:34:33,230
Hello.

3137
02:34:36,010 --> 02:34:37,830
We're clean in the morning...

3138
02:34:45,160 --> 02:34:45,600
Hahahaha.

3139
02:34:47,060 --> 02:34:49,000
We're clean in the morning...

3140
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:49,160
We're clean in the morning...

3141
02:34:49,160 --> 02:34:50,480
I don't even know where, how to clean!

3142
02:34:51,260 --> 02:34:52,840
Wow, it's getting really dark.

3143
02:34:54,440 --> 02:34:56,000
My stamina's getting high.

3144
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,180
Okay, it's not getting any brighter.

3145
02:35:00,320 --> 02:35:04,840
Oh, it'll get... it'll turn daytime now.

3146
02:35:26,580 --> 02:35:30,040
Oh my god, I'm dreaming about the garbage in my... is this a dream?

3147
02:35:30,420 --> 02:35:32,220
Am I getting... did I get abducted?

3148
02:35:36,210 --> 02:35:39,490
Uh oh, wait, I think I'm gonna drown in the garbage.

3149
02:35:39,690 --> 02:35:41,170
I'm dreaming about the garbage in my place.

3150
02:35:42,070 --> 02:35:43,410
Or I'm abducted.

3151
02:35:44,250 --> 02:35:44,670
Um,

3152
02:35:50,450 --> 02:35:51,650
I'm in the back rooms.

3153
02:36:03,620 --> 02:36:04,820
Hold on, I'm trying to get...

3154
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:14,240
My stamina!

3155
02:36:15,260 --> 02:36:16,500
Um, go back to bed, please.

3156
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:27,080
Whoa!

3157
02:36:31,650 --> 02:36:32,550
What was that?

3158
02:36:33,750 --> 02:36:35,010
Wait, was that the drone?

3159
02:36:38,290 --> 02:36:38,690
Huh?

3160
02:36:45,880 --> 02:36:46,400
Uh oh.

3161
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:47,940
Wait, it's not daytime yet.

3162
02:36:48,060 --> 02:36:49,320
My stamina is about to max.

3163
02:37:10,280 --> 02:37:11,760
That's a spooky time.

3164
02:37:17,210 --> 02:37:17,810
Okay.

3165
02:37:18,870 --> 02:37:20,370
Let's clean up in here.

3166
02:37:22,090 --> 02:37:22,690
Um...

3167
02:37:23,710 --> 02:37:25,130
I don't wanna leave.

3168
02:37:28,230 --> 02:37:28,830
So...

3169
02:37:28,830 --> 02:37:29,850
Is that pizza?

3170
02:37:30,050 --> 02:37:30,890
Oh, it's a metal chunk.

3171
02:37:31,990 --> 02:37:32,870
Um...

3172
02:37:32,870 --> 02:37:33,510
Hmm...

3173
02:37:33,510 --> 02:37:34,290
Let's see.

3174
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:49,400
Let's put everything in a pile.

3175
02:37:52,300 --> 02:37:53,480
For now.

3176
02:37:54,060 --> 02:37:55,580
That looks like an origami.

3177
02:37:58,540 --> 02:38:00,660
I wanna like even...

3178
02:38:00,660 --> 02:38:01,220
Our...

3179
02:38:01,220 --> 02:38:02,600
Everything is horrible.

3180
02:38:02,860 --> 02:38:03,520
Oh...

3181
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:04,360
Can't sit.

3182
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:06,260
I'm just trying to grab it.

3183
02:38:07,260 --> 02:38:08,340
Okay, there we go.

3184
02:38:08,900 --> 02:38:09,220
Gently.

3185
02:38:10,500 --> 02:38:11,520
Oh, don't...

3186
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:12,360
Rotate it.

3187
02:38:12,580 --> 02:38:13,040
There we go.

3188
02:38:14,320 --> 02:38:14,820
Ah...

3189
02:38:14,820 --> 02:38:15,360
Ha ha ha!

3190
02:38:16,680 --> 02:38:17,180
Um...

3191
02:38:17,180 --> 02:38:17,900
Collect this.

3192
02:38:22,020 --> 02:38:23,760
We'll put everything in a pile.

3193
02:38:25,020 --> 02:38:26,720
I'm too scared to leave my room.

3194
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:27,480
I'll be honest.

3195
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:30,400
I don't wanna leave.

3196
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:31,880
I'm scared.

3197
02:38:32,620 --> 02:38:34,140
I'm so scared.

3198
02:38:35,940 --> 02:38:36,580
I'm so scared.

3199
02:38:37,020 --> 02:38:38,260
This is important.

3200
02:38:38,660 --> 02:38:39,540
We'll put it here.

3201
02:38:41,440 --> 02:38:42,080
Okay.

3202
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:45,960
If only I had a trash bin.

3203
02:38:47,260 --> 02:38:48,640
But we, uh...

3204
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:50,440
Not everybody can be so lucky, you know?

3205
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:54,840
I don't even trust sleeping on this thing.

3206
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:02,280
Let's put you...

3207
02:39:05,240 --> 02:39:06,120
Right there!

3208
02:39:10,060 --> 02:39:10,840
Oh, wow.

3209
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:13,580
The trash exploded.

3210
02:39:15,700 --> 02:39:17,460
Like, what am I supposed to do with these?

3211
02:39:18,300 --> 02:39:19,900
They sell trash bags on the computer.

3212
02:39:20,060 --> 02:39:21,600
Yeah, but that requires...

3213
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:22,720
Going downstairs.

3214
02:39:23,500 --> 02:39:26,260
Also, I imagine things don't come immediately, right?

3215
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:31,840
There's a trash bin outside the base to the right.

3216
02:39:32,560 --> 02:39:32,980
Oh, okay.

3217
02:39:33,080 --> 02:39:33,400
Awesome.

3218
02:39:35,220 --> 02:39:37,840
Except it spends 40 minutes piling garbage.

3219
02:39:38,500 --> 02:39:39,280
The aliens...

3220
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:41,280
Will just be like...

3221
02:39:42,020 --> 02:39:43,280
They'll be like...

3222
02:39:43,880 --> 02:39:44,560
We don't...

3223
02:39:44,560 --> 02:39:44,800
This...

3224
02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:47,060
This creature's a nut job.

3225
02:39:49,180 --> 02:39:51,260
Maybe we should ignore this place.

3226
02:39:56,870 --> 02:39:58,590
They do a secret ritual.

3227
02:39:58,870 --> 02:40:00,910
At the bewitching hour of...

3228
02:40:00,910 --> 02:40:01,370
Oh, look!

3229
02:40:01,430 --> 02:40:02,170
I found a battery!

3230
02:40:02,730 --> 02:40:03,150
Nice.

3231
02:40:05,450 --> 02:40:06,050
Uh...

3232
02:40:06,930 --> 02:40:07,230
Collect...

3233
02:40:08,230 --> 02:40:08,830
Oops!

3234
02:40:08,970 --> 02:40:10,150
I just collected that trash.

3235
02:40:10,870 --> 02:40:11,250
Wait...

3236
02:40:13,470 --> 02:40:14,070
Um...

3237
02:40:16,780 --> 02:40:18,400
Wait, what did I...

3238
02:40:18,400 --> 02:40:19,180
This one?

3239
02:40:19,280 --> 02:40:19,600
The paper?

3240
02:40:20,720 --> 02:40:22,700
Is this paper also...

3241
02:40:22,700 --> 02:40:24,760
Maybe I need the notepad and not the paper.

3242
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:25,760
Or...

3243
02:40:27,180 --> 02:40:28,540
I think this is garbage.

3244
02:40:29,460 --> 02:40:30,000
Right?

3245
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:34,300
Yeah...

3246
02:40:34,300 --> 02:40:35,380
That's garbage.

3247
02:40:35,720 --> 02:40:36,760
And then this is also...

3248
02:40:37,340 --> 02:40:38,920
Oh wait, I could just drop it.

3249
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:40,240
But it's more fun to do this.

3250
02:40:41,380 --> 02:40:41,900
There we go.

3251
02:40:43,540 --> 02:40:44,620
Middle mouse...

3252
02:40:44,620 --> 02:40:45,940
Quick select from hot bar.

3253
02:40:47,160 --> 02:40:48,340
What is this anyway?

3254
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:49,100
Oh!

3255
02:40:49,440 --> 02:40:50,480
Look how cute!

3256
02:40:53,140 --> 02:40:53,740
Uh...

3257
02:40:54,440 --> 02:40:55,040
Uh...

3258
02:40:56,140 --> 02:40:57,760
How do I...

3259
02:40:58,760 --> 02:41:00,780
How do I set down...

3260
02:41:03,860 --> 02:41:05,900
When I am holding something?

3261
02:41:06,440 --> 02:41:07,640
Alt R...

3262
02:41:07,640 --> 02:41:08,680
Oh wait...

3263
02:41:08,680 --> 02:41:09,900
That doesn't work.

3264
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:12,240
Not for my game for some reason.

3265
02:41:12,380 --> 02:41:14,320
For some reason it opens up my...

3266
02:41:26,340 --> 02:41:27,000
Uh...

3267
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:27,480
Uh...

3268
02:41:28,380 --> 02:41:29,040
Oh...

3269
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:29,900
Uh...

3270
02:41:29,900 --> 02:41:30,660
Windows did not like that.

3271
02:41:30,860 --> 02:41:31,240
One moment.

3272
02:41:32,200 --> 02:41:33,900
It opens up my driver.

3273
02:41:34,280 --> 02:41:35,200
It's just like...

3274
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:35,620
Hey...

3275
02:41:35,620 --> 02:41:36,500
Here's your...

3276
02:41:36,500 --> 02:41:39,080
Here's how your gaming performance is going.

3277
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:43,040
Alt R is NVIDIA overlay.

3278
02:41:43,040 --> 02:41:43,280
Like...

3279
02:41:43,280 --> 02:41:43,600
Yeah, yeah.

3280
02:41:43,720 --> 02:41:44,440
Similar for me.

3281
02:41:45,980 --> 02:41:46,980
So funny.

3282
02:41:48,760 --> 02:41:49,100
Okay.

3283
02:41:52,040 --> 02:41:53,740
Shift Alt R.

3284
02:41:55,880 --> 02:41:56,240
Oh!

3285
02:41:56,600 --> 02:41:57,180
Well...

3286
02:41:58,320 --> 02:42:00,040
We can grab it now.

3287
02:42:00,760 --> 02:42:01,700
We can...

3288
02:42:01,700 --> 02:42:03,680
Place it as we wish.

3289
02:42:04,980 --> 02:42:05,540
Cute!

3290
02:42:05,540 --> 02:42:05,860
Cute!

3291
02:42:09,980 --> 02:42:11,600
It's starting to feel way...

3292
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:13,700
Oh wait, I grabbed that from my suitcase now, didn't I?

3293
02:42:14,280 --> 02:42:15,980
It's starting to feel so much like home.

3294
02:42:16,400 --> 02:42:17,420
What else we got in here?

3295
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:18,400
Car keys?

3296
02:42:18,900 --> 02:42:19,620
My certificate!

3297
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:21,420
How...

3298
02:42:21,420 --> 02:42:22,000
Place...

3299
02:42:25,300 --> 02:42:25,840
Perfect.

3300
02:42:27,420 --> 02:42:27,960
Use?

3301
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:32,120
Custom content is disabled.

3302
02:42:36,140 --> 02:42:36,580
Perfect.

3303
02:42:40,930 --> 02:42:41,670
Good, good.

3304
02:42:41,790 --> 02:42:42,990
We're clearing out our inventory.

3305
02:42:43,270 --> 02:42:44,590
And the toilet paper roll.

3306
02:42:46,450 --> 02:42:47,150
Oh, no, no.

3307
02:42:47,230 --> 02:42:47,750
Not the battery.

3308
02:42:48,110 --> 02:42:48,570
Wait, no.

3309
02:42:48,890 --> 02:42:49,290
Just kidding.

3310
02:42:51,130 --> 02:42:52,130
Yeah, I placed that.

3311
02:42:52,270 --> 02:42:53,370
Where'd the battery go, though?

3312
02:42:53,690 --> 02:42:53,990
Uh-oh.

3313
02:42:54,470 --> 02:42:55,470
Guys, I lost the battery.

3314
02:42:55,990 --> 02:42:56,430
Uh-oh.

3315
02:42:58,250 --> 02:42:59,410
I lost the battery.

3316
02:43:00,370 --> 02:43:00,810
No!

3317
02:43:01,890 --> 02:43:03,290
I accidentally placed it!

3318
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:05,470
I don't know where I placed it!

3319
02:43:07,110 --> 02:43:08,150
How did that fall?

3320
02:43:09,730 --> 02:43:11,370
Oh my gosh, this scared me.

3321
02:43:12,630 --> 02:43:13,030
Collect.

3322
02:43:17,280 --> 02:43:18,240
How'd you fall?

3323
02:43:18,960 --> 02:43:20,000
Aw, man!

3324
02:43:22,360 --> 02:43:23,360
What was that?

3325
02:43:23,500 --> 02:43:24,060
Where was my tummy?

3326
02:43:24,700 --> 02:43:26,400
Gosh, I'm always so hungry.

3327
02:43:27,540 --> 02:43:27,920
Uh-oh.

3328
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:29,560
Wait.

3329
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:35,740
Eat.

3330
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:36,760
There we go.

3331
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:42,660
A hundred plus.

3332
02:43:42,660 --> 02:43:43,220
All right.

3333
02:43:43,380 --> 02:43:44,780
We'll be good for now.

3334
02:43:49,960 --> 02:43:50,560
We're...

3335
02:43:51,360 --> 02:43:51,960
Yes!

3336
02:43:55,440 --> 02:43:56,040
And...

3337
02:43:56,040 --> 02:43:56,680
Right there.

3338
02:43:57,720 --> 02:44:00,460
I accidentally bumped the table a little bit, I think.

3339
02:44:12,210 --> 02:44:13,010
Grab it.

3340
02:44:13,950 --> 02:44:14,190
Oh.

3341
02:44:14,590 --> 02:44:16,890
Wow, everything is really sensitive, huh?

3342
02:44:18,930 --> 02:44:19,730
Come here.

3343
02:44:22,110 --> 02:44:24,530
We'll take that to the garbage later.

3344
02:44:26,030 --> 02:44:27,210
What time is it now?

3345
02:44:28,270 --> 02:44:29,230
It's 530!

3346
02:44:32,190 --> 02:44:33,850
The sun is starting to come up.

3347
02:44:39,890 --> 02:44:42,050
We should be able to...

3348
02:44:44,130 --> 02:44:46,050
Someone said there's a garbage...

3349
02:44:49,940 --> 02:44:50,780
Somewhere.

3350
02:44:52,920 --> 02:44:55,080
There's heaps of garbage, yeah.

3351
02:44:55,820 --> 02:44:58,380
But I gotta make money to eat?

3352
02:44:58,720 --> 02:44:59,520
I think.

3353
02:45:02,320 --> 02:45:03,760
I wanna...

3354
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:04,820
I'll be honest, guys.

3355
02:45:04,980 --> 02:45:05,680
I'm kinda hungry.

3356
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:07,140
I was thinking of...

3357
02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:08,500
Are those shoes?

3358
02:45:09,460 --> 02:45:09,980
No.

3359
02:45:11,420 --> 02:45:15,340
I was thinking of stopping stream, but I kinda want something freaky to happen before then.

3360
02:45:16,220 --> 02:45:16,940
You know?

3361
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:21,760
I wanna see something freaky happen.

3362
02:45:28,330 --> 02:45:30,370
Our garbage pile.

3363
02:45:30,890 --> 02:45:32,030
Garbage day!

3364
02:45:35,330 --> 02:45:36,410
Go eat.

3365
02:45:36,650 --> 02:45:38,230
I will when something freaky happens.

3366
02:45:41,080 --> 02:45:41,810
What's in here?

3367
02:45:44,010 --> 02:45:44,550
Okay.

3368
02:45:45,590 --> 02:45:46,330
Weren't there...

3369
02:45:46,330 --> 02:45:47,550
Oh yeah, there's MREs in here.

3370
02:45:47,550 --> 02:45:49,030
We'll collect those.

3371
02:45:52,890 --> 02:45:53,530
Um...

3372
02:45:53,530 --> 02:45:54,550
That's not...

3373
02:45:55,490 --> 02:45:56,410
Oh, look!

3374
02:45:56,510 --> 02:45:57,030
A cookbook!

3375
02:45:58,310 --> 02:46:01,330
Dough, buns, burger, steak, hot dog...

3376
02:46:01,330 --> 02:46:02,450
Hot dog!

3377
02:46:02,830 --> 02:46:03,270
Hints!

3378
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:13,860
You can use the knife to slice other food like bread, watermelon, etc.

3379
02:46:14,540 --> 02:46:16,320
Water container is a bucket of water.

3380
02:46:20,160 --> 02:46:21,440
I see.

3381
02:46:22,140 --> 02:46:24,360
Well, I have a lot of garbage here.

3382
02:46:25,180 --> 02:46:26,560
Before I can...

3383
02:46:26,560 --> 02:46:27,240
Oops!

3384
02:46:27,520 --> 02:46:27,880
Oopsie!

3385
02:46:29,300 --> 02:46:29,660
Oh!

3386
02:46:29,820 --> 02:46:30,880
My flashlight just died.

3387
02:46:34,230 --> 02:46:35,270
How do I use it?

3388
02:46:41,500 --> 02:46:42,100
There we go.

3389
02:46:42,760 --> 02:46:43,020
Wait.

3390
02:46:44,380 --> 02:46:45,240
Oh yeah, that worked.

3391
02:46:45,400 --> 02:46:45,940
Okay, good, good, good.

3392
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:50,580
I think the day is beginning.

3393
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:52,160
The dawn is arising.

3394
02:46:56,880 --> 02:46:57,340
Yeah.

3395
02:46:58,640 --> 02:46:59,760
Let's go downstairs.

3396
02:47:00,960 --> 02:47:01,400
Boop!

3397
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:06,000
You can slice water.

3398
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:07,560
Probably.

3399
02:47:10,500 --> 02:47:11,420
Bottle.

3400
02:47:14,570 --> 02:47:16,630
Dawn of the second day.

3401
02:47:18,170 --> 02:47:20,750
Today, we search for a trash can.

3402
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:24,130
That is the goal.

3403
02:47:27,950 --> 02:47:29,630
To find...

3404
02:47:30,170 --> 02:47:31,230
Trash can.

3405
02:47:35,340 --> 02:47:36,180
Somewhere.

3406
02:47:36,180 --> 02:47:36,340
Somewhere.

3407
02:47:38,140 --> 02:47:40,420
Freddy starts moving on day four.

3408
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:45,380
So...

3409
02:47:45,720 --> 02:47:49,240
Does someone come and like pick these up or...

3410
02:47:52,370 --> 02:47:53,690
Metal cans.

3411
02:47:54,090 --> 02:47:55,590
Oh no, I have to separate everything.

3412
02:47:58,980 --> 02:48:00,720
No, it just stores trash.

3413
02:48:00,720 --> 02:48:01,260
No?

3414
02:48:01,720 --> 02:48:02,280
Uh oh.

3415
02:48:10,340 --> 02:48:12,140
Then what do I do with this?

3416
02:48:15,220 --> 02:48:16,740
You can sell trash.

3417
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:19,580
Then I'm sitting on a gold mine.

3418
02:48:27,080 --> 02:48:28,440
We sell...

3419
02:48:30,860 --> 02:48:31,840
In here?

3420
02:48:34,760 --> 02:48:35,840
With the drone?

3421
02:48:37,120 --> 02:48:38,740
Can I sell the mannequins?

3422
02:48:41,960 --> 02:48:43,040
Wait, I...

3423
02:48:47,580 --> 02:48:48,940
Open the garage door.

3424
02:48:49,060 --> 02:48:49,900
Oh, that's a good idea.

3425
02:48:50,980 --> 02:48:51,220
Wait.

3426
02:48:54,020 --> 02:48:54,560
Smoking.

3427
02:48:54,760 --> 02:48:55,280
Okay.

3428
02:48:57,580 --> 02:48:59,680
Wait, I didn't call the drone.

3429
02:49:00,160 --> 02:49:02,860
So why did that thing come in the middle of the night?

3430
02:49:16,400 --> 02:49:17,720
Did it leave anything?

3431
02:49:17,720 --> 02:49:19,420
I don't even know where it would leave.

3432
02:49:21,960 --> 02:49:22,940
Metal scrap.

3433
02:49:23,620 --> 02:49:24,420
Got a hammer.

3434
02:49:24,960 --> 02:49:25,780
A wrench.

3435
02:49:26,220 --> 02:49:26,820
Notepad.

3436
02:49:31,300 --> 02:49:31,680
Oh wait.

3437
02:49:37,180 --> 02:49:38,740
Red button near the door.

3438
02:49:39,460 --> 02:49:40,160
Did I miss it?

3439
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:40,940
Oh, I did.

3440
02:49:41,880 --> 02:49:42,660
Thank you.

3441
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:46,760
Oh!

3442
02:49:48,700 --> 02:49:51,120
They gave me MRE and drive!

3443
02:49:53,480 --> 02:49:54,840
How kind!

3444
02:49:56,580 --> 02:49:58,700
Is it because it was my first day?

3445
02:49:59,660 --> 02:50:00,240
Alright.

3446
02:50:01,280 --> 02:50:02,200
So then...

3447
02:50:02,200 --> 02:50:03,160
Loading bay.

3448
02:50:03,380 --> 02:50:03,880
Keep clear.

3449
02:50:03,880 --> 02:50:06,040
So if I put a bunch of junk here...

3450
02:50:07,140 --> 02:50:08,880
If I put all this garbo...

3451
02:50:09,460 --> 02:50:10,340
That'll collect it?

3452
02:50:23,580 --> 02:50:25,280
It needs to be in a box.

3453
02:50:26,220 --> 02:50:26,740
Oh...

3454
02:50:26,740 --> 02:50:27,840
They said you need a crate.

3455
02:50:29,800 --> 02:50:31,080
This looks like a crate.

3456
02:50:32,560 --> 02:50:33,460
Can't open.

3457
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:33,920
Shoot.

3458
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:43,600
I want these mannequins out of my office.

3459
02:50:49,600 --> 02:50:50,140
Okay.

3460
02:50:50,420 --> 02:50:51,180
Well, hold on.

3461
02:50:52,960 --> 02:50:54,150
What I can do...

3462
02:50:55,210 --> 02:50:57,270
Is check on the thing that was downloading.

3463
02:51:01,910 --> 02:51:02,670
Which is done.

3464
02:51:03,050 --> 02:51:03,310
Perfect.

3465
02:51:04,090 --> 02:51:05,350
And then we can import it.

3466
02:51:07,890 --> 02:51:08,910
Or save.

3467
02:51:09,650 --> 02:51:11,310
And then we can import it.

3468
02:51:11,870 --> 02:51:13,050
And then we can listen.

3469
02:51:15,230 --> 02:51:16,310
No, we can't.

3470
02:51:21,010 --> 02:51:21,570
Yep.

3471
02:51:21,570 --> 02:51:24,530
Sounds like a dwarf planet.

3472
02:51:24,930 --> 02:51:25,610
Number one.

3473
02:51:27,490 --> 02:51:28,630
The basement.

3474
02:51:28,770 --> 02:51:29,870
I'm scared of the basement!

3475
02:51:31,610 --> 02:51:33,610
There's an incinerator down there?

3476
02:51:33,850 --> 02:51:34,770
Oh, shoot.

3477
02:51:35,830 --> 02:51:36,150
Okay.

3478
02:51:36,230 --> 02:51:37,530
Maybe I have to go to the basement.

3479
02:51:38,310 --> 02:51:38,670
Okay.

3480
02:51:39,310 --> 02:51:41,660
Now I don't have the processor.

3481
02:51:42,730 --> 02:51:44,270
So I just...

3482
02:51:44,270 --> 02:51:45,150
Grab it.

3483
02:51:46,210 --> 02:51:47,690
And put it in here.

3484
02:51:50,570 --> 02:51:51,450
Like...

3485
02:51:51,450 --> 02:51:51,470
Like so.

3486
02:51:54,890 --> 02:51:55,330
Takezo!

3487
02:51:55,970 --> 02:51:57,110
Thank you for the gifted!

3488
02:51:58,290 --> 02:51:59,510
Thank you!

3489
02:52:00,310 --> 02:52:01,190
Alright.

3490
02:52:01,490 --> 02:52:01,590
Oh.

3491
02:52:01,870 --> 02:52:02,310
Sorry.

3492
02:52:03,010 --> 02:52:04,730
Freaks me out when it...

3493
02:52:04,730 --> 02:52:05,210
Save.

3494
02:52:10,280 --> 02:52:11,160
Five?

3495
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:12,980
Wait, what is that down there?

3496
02:52:13,560 --> 02:52:14,180
Five?

3497
02:52:16,340 --> 02:52:16,780
Huh?

3498
02:52:17,320 --> 02:52:17,780
Huh?

3499
02:52:20,520 --> 02:52:20,920
Five?

3500
02:52:21,420 --> 02:52:22,300
What do you mean by that?

3501
02:52:29,750 --> 02:52:30,870
I don't want to zoom in.

3502
02:52:30,990 --> 02:52:31,530
Please get me out.

3503
02:52:31,750 --> 02:52:32,050
I...

3504
02:52:32,050 --> 02:52:32,430
Zoom out.

3505
02:52:32,570 --> 02:52:32,890
Zoom out.

3506
02:52:37,010 --> 02:52:38,050
How do I zoom out?

3507
02:52:40,490 --> 02:52:41,690
Wait, I don't...

3508
02:52:41,690 --> 02:52:43,450
I don't wanna...

3509
02:52:46,870 --> 02:52:47,270
Shift?

3510
02:52:48,950 --> 02:52:49,350
No?

3511
02:52:51,270 --> 02:52:52,350
Okay, it's fine.

3512
02:53:04,830 --> 02:53:05,190
Hmm.

3513
02:53:06,490 --> 02:53:06,930
Okay.

3514
02:53:08,010 --> 02:53:09,190
Well, um...

3515
02:53:09,190 --> 02:53:10,530
Let's go to the basement, I guess.

3516
02:53:12,830 --> 02:53:13,370
Hmm.

3517
02:53:18,630 --> 02:53:19,290
Okay.

3518
02:53:45,280 --> 02:53:45,640
Well, um...

3519
02:53:45,640 --> 02:53:46,220
Oh, that's...

3520
02:53:46,220 --> 02:53:47,060
That's that thing.

3521
02:53:47,200 --> 02:53:48,660
I don't remember what it was.

3522
02:53:50,080 --> 02:53:50,740
Is

3523
02:53:56,230 --> 02:53:56,990
that it?

3524
02:53:58,070 --> 02:53:58,650
Wait.

3525
02:53:58,650 --> 02:54:00,410
Why is there no music down here?

3526
02:54:00,590 --> 02:54:01,470
Makes me...

3527
02:54:01,470 --> 02:54:02,110
Pfff.

3528
02:54:09,950 --> 02:54:10,530
Oh.

3529
02:54:16,450 --> 02:54:18,530
Wait, why is there a chair here?

3530
02:54:21,860 --> 02:54:22,440
Oh.

3531
02:54:22,540 --> 02:54:23,380
Oh my gosh.

3532
02:54:25,520 --> 02:54:27,000
Why is there a chair?

3533
02:54:37,780 --> 02:54:39,580
Oh, it still doesn't open though.

3534
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:41,560
Interesting.

3535
02:54:44,540 --> 02:54:45,100
Wait.

3536
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:45,880
Wait.

3537
02:54:48,080 --> 02:54:49,940
It's too heavy for me to push.

3538
02:54:56,580 --> 02:54:57,400
There we go.

3539
02:55:00,180 --> 02:55:01,080
There we go.

3540
02:55:01,600 --> 02:55:02,480
Rubber trash.

3541
02:55:03,520 --> 02:55:03,780
Whoa!

3542
02:55:04,060 --> 02:55:04,220
Whoa!

3543
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:05,280
A cell phone!

3544
02:55:07,940 --> 02:55:08,500
Oh!

3545
02:55:08,660 --> 02:55:09,740
Thank you for the raid!

3546
02:55:10,820 --> 02:55:11,880
Thank you!

3547
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:14,060
I'm a scary part of game!

3548
02:55:15,480 --> 02:55:16,840
Wait, what's in here?

3549
02:55:18,640 --> 02:55:20,500
Okay, let's just cover that back up.

3550
02:55:21,720 --> 02:55:22,460
Good enough.

3551
02:55:23,020 --> 02:55:25,120
I'm guessing this is the incinerator?

3552
02:55:28,200 --> 02:55:28,680
I

3553
02:55:44,640 --> 02:55:46,800
need to figure out a way to move those first, I think.

3554
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:49,480
Maybe.

3555
02:55:50,720 --> 02:55:51,420
It's hot.

3556
02:55:51,740 --> 02:55:52,240
I think.

3557
02:55:52,840 --> 02:55:54,020
I don't know what I did.

3558
02:55:56,780 --> 02:55:57,300
Uh...

3559
02:55:57,300 --> 02:55:58,420
Ducky, thank you for the gifter!

3560
02:55:59,380 --> 02:56:01,060
You can burn the mannequins.

3561
02:56:01,220 --> 02:56:02,460
Yeah, I plan on it.

3562
02:56:04,540 --> 02:56:05,060
Okay.

3563
02:56:07,620 --> 02:56:08,820
Hold on one second.

3564
02:56:09,540 --> 02:56:11,120
Something is like on my...

3565
02:56:11,120 --> 02:56:13,240
Something's acting up on my computer!

3566
02:56:19,410 --> 02:56:20,090
Okay, okay.

3567
02:56:20,910 --> 02:56:21,690
Okie dokie.

3568
02:56:25,970 --> 02:56:27,210
I'm acting up.

3569
02:56:27,370 --> 02:56:28,370
Well, quit it!

3570
02:56:36,950 --> 02:56:39,270
Tools to break the boxes with.

3571
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:10,740
Was that a prank?

3572
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:13,580
Was that a practical joke?

3573
02:57:16,220 --> 02:57:18,020
I think you have to equip it.

3574
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:20,720
Like, hold it?

3575
02:57:44,440 --> 02:57:46,140
I don't wanna waste my flashlight.

3576
02:57:47,860 --> 02:57:48,420
Nice!

3577
02:57:49,440 --> 02:57:50,600
Is there anything in here?

3578
02:57:51,680 --> 02:57:52,240
Nope.

3579
02:57:54,100 --> 02:57:54,860
Go ahead.

3580
02:58:00,280 --> 02:58:02,020
Turn on the lights?

3581
02:58:03,760 --> 02:58:04,240
Oh.

3582
02:58:07,550 --> 02:58:10,310
It's hard to see the light switch.

3583
02:58:11,590 --> 02:58:12,110
Okay.

3584
02:58:12,670 --> 02:58:12,930
Hahaha!

3585
02:59:03,640 --> 02:59:05,560
We will...

3586
02:59:07,340 --> 02:59:08,840
We will...

3587
02:59:08,840 --> 02:59:09,200
We will...

3588
02:59:09,200 --> 02:59:09,560
We will...

3589
02:59:09,560 --> 02:59:09,660
We will...

3590
02:59:09,660 --> 02:59:09,840
We will...

3591
02:59:09,840 --> 02:59:10,080
Rock you!

3592
02:59:12,160 --> 02:59:13,120
Nice!

3593
02:59:20,580 --> 02:59:21,780
There's a bunch of...

3594
02:59:21,780 --> 02:59:22,120
Plastics.

3595
02:59:23,020 --> 02:59:23,860
I could...

3596
02:59:23,860 --> 02:59:25,120
I don't know if I should eat that.

3597
02:59:26,800 --> 02:59:27,320
Mmm...

3598
02:59:27,320 --> 02:59:27,540
Okay.

3599
02:59:28,080 --> 02:59:28,500
Metal scrap.

3600
02:59:28,840 --> 02:59:29,720
Now I can open it.

3601
02:59:31,980 --> 02:59:32,500
Holy...

3602
02:59:32,500 --> 02:59:33,640
It's kind of ominous.

3603
02:59:34,280 --> 02:59:35,540
The door is open.

3604
02:59:47,510 --> 02:59:48,030
Freaky.

3605
02:59:50,710 --> 02:59:52,930
Oh, there's so much wooden debris now!

3606
02:59:52,930 --> 02:59:53,890
Okay.

3607
02:59:55,770 --> 02:59:57,050
Okay, I might need...

3608
03:00:00,510 --> 03:00:01,110
Uh...

3609
03:00:02,850 --> 03:00:03,830
Rubber trash.

3610
03:00:06,490 --> 03:00:08,430
You're gonna force me in here though.

3611
03:00:08,630 --> 03:00:09,970
Clean up all the mess.

3612
03:00:10,430 --> 03:00:12,350
It's so spooky and dark down here.

3613
03:00:13,330 --> 03:00:15,170
I don't wanna be down here.

3614
03:00:15,630 --> 03:00:16,450
It's so...

3615
03:00:16,450 --> 03:00:18,010
It's too quiet, you know?

3616
03:00:18,650 --> 03:00:18,950
Cool!

3617
03:00:20,810 --> 03:00:21,790
What is that?

3618
03:00:21,790 --> 03:00:23,230
Rubber trash.

3619
03:00:23,730 --> 03:00:24,790
What is this?

3620
03:00:26,130 --> 03:00:26,450
Oh.

3621
03:00:32,230 --> 03:00:33,250
My potato!

3622
03:00:33,790 --> 03:00:34,970
Wait, is that the potato?

3623
03:00:35,750 --> 03:00:36,850
How do I get that?

3624
03:00:44,230 --> 03:00:45,150
Uh... I'm stuck.

3625
03:00:46,530 --> 03:00:47,410
There we go.

3626
03:00:50,070 --> 03:00:52,470
I guess that's just a bunch of scrap altogether.

3627
03:00:53,490 --> 03:00:53,650
Oh!

3628
03:00:54,110 --> 03:00:54,770
Okay.

3629
03:00:56,120 --> 03:00:57,050
Something happened.

3630
03:00:57,430 --> 03:00:58,490
Canned peaches!

3631
03:01:00,290 --> 03:01:03,730
Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches...

3632
03:01:09,560 --> 03:01:10,220
Collisions.

3633
03:01:10,620 --> 03:01:12,040
The collisions are having fun.

3634
03:01:12,200 --> 03:01:12,340
Okay.

3635
03:01:12,780 --> 03:01:13,820
What time is it?

3636
03:01:15,140 --> 03:01:17,840
Time is a construct to me now.

3637
03:01:20,300 --> 03:01:21,300
I think it works.

3638
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:23,940
That's it?

3639
03:01:24,280 --> 03:01:24,660
Oh!

3640
03:01:25,420 --> 03:01:26,580
Are you kidding me?

3641
03:01:26,580 --> 03:01:29,580
It left more wooden debris on the floor for me!

3642
03:01:38,990 --> 03:01:39,390
Open.

3643
03:01:42,050 --> 03:01:42,850
Okay.

3644
03:01:46,140 --> 03:01:46,860
Okay.

3645
03:01:50,020 --> 03:01:51,280
It's still daylight?

3646
03:01:51,880 --> 03:01:52,600
Yes.

3647
03:01:54,860 --> 03:01:55,260
Perfect.

3648
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,120
Hello, work... station?

3649
03:02:03,900 --> 03:02:04,780
11am.

3650
03:02:05,220 --> 03:02:06,220
Just in time.

3651
03:02:07,860 --> 03:02:08,740
Still...

3652
03:02:09,260 --> 03:02:10,040
Five...

3653
03:02:11,260 --> 03:02:11,780
Critters.

3654
03:02:20,410 --> 03:02:22,730
Oh my gosh, I thought I saw Bigfoot.

3655
03:02:25,910 --> 03:02:28,910
That's why I jerked my mouse.

3656
03:02:29,970 --> 03:02:32,130
I thought I saw Bigfoot for real.

3657
03:02:35,150 --> 03:02:36,290
Was that a new ping on the...

3658
03:02:36,290 --> 03:02:37,610
Yeah, but don't worry about it.

3659
03:02:37,750 --> 03:02:37,850
Okay.

3660
03:02:38,730 --> 03:02:39,430
Da-dum.

3661
03:02:40,790 --> 03:02:41,310
Let's go out.

3662
03:02:41,570 --> 03:02:44,710
I wish that it could tell you which ones were closer.

3663
03:02:45,050 --> 03:02:47,910
You know, like if it was really far away, it would be a long...

3664
03:02:48,950 --> 03:02:50,390
A long arm.

3665
03:02:50,590 --> 03:02:53,270
And if it was really close, it would be a short arm.

3666
03:02:56,050 --> 03:02:56,850
It does.

3667
03:02:59,650 --> 03:03:01,090
What do you mean it does?

3668
03:03:02,810 --> 03:03:04,430
Depends on the size of the arrow.

3669
03:03:05,230 --> 03:03:06,310
Oh, wait, it's right there.

3670
03:03:09,950 --> 03:03:10,810
So far.

3671
03:03:12,770 --> 03:03:14,590
The smaller the arrow, the closer?

3672
03:03:15,830 --> 03:03:16,290
No...

3673
03:03:17,010 --> 03:03:17,810
No way?

3674
03:03:18,010 --> 03:03:19,510
Jay, thank you so much for the podcast.

3675
03:03:22,050 --> 03:03:23,090
Are you...

3676
03:03:23,090 --> 03:03:23,790
Serious?

3677
03:03:23,790 --> 03:03:25,930
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

3678
03:03:29,680 --> 03:03:30,880
I'm Harley���ge!

3679
03:03:35,820 --> 03:03:37,000
Check emails?

3680
03:03:37,360 --> 03:03:38,880
Oh, do I have a new one?

3681
03:03:39,160 --> 03:03:39,980
Oh, I do.

3682
03:03:40,600 --> 03:03:41,420
Daily task.

3683
03:03:41,680 --> 03:03:42,960
This is a task for today.

3684
03:03:44,440 --> 03:03:46,200
Two signals of level zero.

3685
03:03:46,640 --> 03:03:47,540
Reward 31.

3686
03:03:48,240 --> 03:03:50,020
Check the satellite and make a report.

3687
03:03:50,200 --> 03:03:51,440
Tango Sedera Uniform?

3688
03:03:54,600 --> 03:03:55,080
What?!

3689
03:03:55,080 --> 03:03:58,320
Blue Wolf, thank you so much for the 50th gift!

3690
03:03:58,420 --> 03:03:59,040
Thank you!

3691
03:04:02,720 --> 03:04:03,900
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3692
03:04:05,140 --> 03:04:05,620
Okay.

3693
03:04:07,540 --> 03:04:09,340
Well, we're still waiting for it, right?

3694
03:04:09,540 --> 03:04:10,380
To download here?

3695
03:04:12,220 --> 03:04:13,060
Here it comes.

3696
03:04:13,980 --> 03:04:14,460
Okie dokie.

3697
03:04:15,700 --> 03:04:17,960
Wait, I can do this daily task, though.

3698
03:04:18,260 --> 03:04:19,680
Because I have two signals.

3699
03:04:24,790 --> 03:04:26,350
What'd I do with the lid?

3700
03:04:27,790 --> 03:04:28,430
Oh,

3701
03:04:34,270 --> 03:04:35,190
I have it.

3702
03:04:39,450 --> 03:04:40,450
There we go.

3703
03:04:40,790 --> 03:04:42,930
And then...

3704
03:04:48,930 --> 03:04:51,610
There's something about writing, I don't remember.

3705
03:04:53,470 --> 03:04:56,750
There's a way to get a free upgrade for processing, but you need to type...

3706
03:04:57,510 --> 03:04:57,910
Uh-oh.

3707
03:04:58,630 --> 03:04:58,890
Oh!

3708
03:04:59,330 --> 03:05:01,050
Thank you, Ildaren!

3709
03:05:01,650 --> 03:05:02,290
But...

3710
03:05:04,830 --> 03:05:05,790
I'm just...

3711
03:05:05,790 --> 03:05:06,650
Uh...

3712
03:05:06,650 --> 03:05:07,630
It's okay!

3713
03:05:09,070 --> 03:05:10,790
I wanna get it on my own!

3714
03:05:12,310 --> 03:05:13,410
Jesse, thank you so much!

3715
03:05:13,470 --> 03:05:14,190
Welcome to Bamboo Ship!

3716
03:05:14,630 --> 03:05:15,890
Notebook and click report.

3717
03:05:16,710 --> 03:05:18,290
So if I click use...

3718
03:05:19,130 --> 03:05:19,610
Report!

3719
03:05:23,610 --> 03:05:24,990
How do I get the...

3720
03:05:24,990 --> 03:05:27,110
Wait, I'm confused about the satellite.

3721
03:05:32,400 --> 03:05:34,220
Cause I didn't get the report.

3722
03:05:36,840 --> 03:05:38,620
Consulate the server room.

3723
03:05:52,320 --> 03:05:53,080
Uh...

3724
03:05:54,320 --> 03:05:55,080
Target...

3725
03:05:57,320 --> 03:05:58,080
Uh...

3726
03:06:02,620 --> 03:06:04,180
Wait, I'm getting...

3727
03:06:04,180 --> 03:06:04,680
Mixed...

3728
03:06:07,460 --> 03:06:09,660
I'm getting mixed...

3729
03:06:11,560 --> 03:06:12,120
Uh...

3730
03:06:12,120 --> 03:06:12,460
Things.

3731
03:06:13,560 --> 03:06:18,260
People telling me I have to go there physically, and people telling me I have to type it in.

3732
03:06:18,820 --> 03:06:19,660
I'm confused.

3733
03:06:22,360 --> 03:06:24,180
I don't even know what...

3734
03:06:24,180 --> 03:06:24,880
I'm...

3735
03:06:24,880 --> 03:06:25,700
I'm actually confused.

3736
03:06:26,180 --> 03:06:26,360
Hahaha!

3737
03:06:32,830 --> 03:06:35,050
SV hash for satellite report.

3738
03:06:37,850 --> 03:06:39,370
But it says I can't access.

3739
03:06:39,610 --> 03:06:40,670
So do I have to go to them?

3740
03:06:41,850 --> 03:06:43,710
I have to go there and type it.

3741
03:06:45,590 --> 03:06:46,110
Uh...

3742
03:06:50,930 --> 03:06:51,710
Okay.

3743
03:06:53,970 --> 03:06:55,690
Well, it's still early.

3744
03:06:56,470 --> 03:06:57,710
We need...

3745
03:06:57,710 --> 03:07:00,610
No wonder it's so much money you get for each server.

3746
03:07:01,290 --> 03:07:02,950
Tango Sierra Uniform.

3747
03:07:06,030 --> 03:07:07,570
We'll come back to this.

3748
03:07:12,150 --> 03:07:13,870
How do I know where is where?

3749
03:07:16,310 --> 03:07:16,950
Okay.

3750
03:07:18,210 --> 03:07:18,850
And...

3751
03:07:18,850 --> 03:07:18,970
Drive.

3752
03:07:18,970 --> 03:07:19,050
Drive.

3753
03:07:19,690 --> 03:07:20,370
Oh!

3754
03:07:20,750 --> 03:07:21,590
Oh god.

3755
03:07:22,110 --> 03:07:22,510
Oh!

3756
03:07:22,850 --> 03:07:23,210
Okay.

3757
03:07:23,710 --> 03:07:23,890
Oh!

3758
03:07:24,470 --> 03:07:24,970
Oh!

3759
03:07:26,190 --> 03:07:26,870
Uh...

3760
03:07:32,720 --> 03:07:33,400
Uh...

3761
03:07:33,400 --> 03:07:33,960
Road Troop!

3762
03:07:39,550 --> 03:07:41,030
There's a satellite...

3763
03:07:41,030 --> 03:07:41,370
Right here!

3764
03:07:42,510 --> 03:07:44,410
Let's go see what it's name is.

3765
03:07:46,710 --> 03:07:47,590
Oh gosh.

3766
03:07:48,570 --> 03:07:49,130
Okay.

3767
03:07:49,530 --> 03:07:51,630
I don't think I'll get sick from this.

3768
03:07:51,890 --> 03:07:52,950
How do I get off?

3769
03:07:54,570 --> 03:07:56,010
Get me off this!

3770
03:07:56,010 --> 03:07:57,490
This crazy ride!

3771
03:07:59,370 --> 03:08:00,970
Be careful...

3772
03:08:00,970 --> 03:08:02,510
Falling rock.

3773
03:08:03,190 --> 03:08:03,490
Uh-oh.

3774
03:08:03,730 --> 03:08:04,610
How do I put it in park?

3775
03:08:06,430 --> 03:08:07,230
Um...

3776
03:08:13,700 --> 03:08:14,900
Don't do that.

3777
03:08:15,100 --> 03:08:15,920
Don't do that.

3778
03:08:17,080 --> 03:08:17,440
Why?

3779
03:08:17,880 --> 03:08:18,400
Why?

3780
03:08:28,010 --> 03:08:28,810
Am I okay?

3781
03:08:30,110 --> 03:08:31,350
Walk it off.

3782
03:08:33,170 --> 03:08:34,930
Where'd my ATV go?

3783
03:08:42,530 --> 03:08:43,250
Where'd my ATV go?

3784
03:08:43,670 --> 03:08:44,110
Um...

3785
03:08:44,110 --> 03:08:45,810
Ah!

3786
03:08:47,510 --> 03:08:48,690
That's me!

3787
03:08:50,570 --> 03:08:52,070
I think I have a...

3788
03:08:52,070 --> 03:08:52,550
Uh...

3789
03:08:52,550 --> 03:08:53,290
Brain injury.

3790
03:08:59,790 --> 03:09:00,390
Oh no.

3791
03:09:00,510 --> 03:09:01,250
I stopped bleeding.

3792
03:09:01,950 --> 03:09:02,630
We're fine.

3793
03:09:07,230 --> 03:09:08,810
Where'd my bike go?

3794
03:09:11,890 --> 03:09:12,610
Um...

3795
03:09:13,430 --> 03:09:15,810
Things are not going according to plan.

3796
03:09:20,230 --> 03:09:20,950
Uh...

3797
03:09:20,950 --> 03:09:22,290
Here's a satellite.

3798
03:09:22,710 --> 03:09:23,810
Let's go see this name.

3799
03:09:26,150 --> 03:09:27,190
Gravity stolen.

3800
03:09:30,190 --> 03:09:31,930
Hold the keys and then click right.

3801
03:09:32,150 --> 03:09:32,250
Okay.

3802
03:09:32,470 --> 03:09:34,050
Let's see what this place is first.

3803
03:09:37,190 --> 03:09:39,070
This is gonna be...

3804
03:09:39,610 --> 03:09:40,130
Tango!

3805
03:09:47,440 --> 03:09:48,420
Shut up Murphy.

3806
03:09:48,420 --> 03:09:49,900
This is...

3807
03:09:49,900 --> 03:09:50,740
We're at...

3808
03:09:51,680 --> 03:09:52,560
Uh...

3809
03:09:54,480 --> 03:09:56,220
Where am I?

3810
03:09:59,360 --> 03:10:00,240
Uh...

3811
03:10:01,220 --> 03:10:02,100
Uh...

3812
03:10:02,100 --> 03:10:03,520
How do I know where I am?

3813
03:10:04,160 --> 03:10:04,900
Top right...

3814
03:10:04,900 --> 03:10:05,800
Oh, we're at Echo!

3815
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:08,440
Okay.

3816
03:10:12,640 --> 03:10:13,520
Echo...

3817
03:10:16,220 --> 03:10:17,100
This is...

3818
03:10:17,580 --> 03:10:18,020
S...

3819
03:10:18,020 --> 03:10:18,300
Uh...

3820
03:10:18,300 --> 03:10:20,980
Would you guys ever do, like, a firewatch job?

3821
03:10:22,320 --> 03:10:23,700
Part of me...

3822
03:10:24,240 --> 03:10:28,060
Really just wants to, like, give it all up and do a firewatch job.

3823
03:10:28,840 --> 03:10:29,440
You know?

3824
03:10:31,400 --> 03:10:33,300
I mean, it's not a forever thing.

3825
03:10:33,500 --> 03:10:35,340
Like, people go for a season or...

3826
03:10:35,340 --> 03:10:37,740
You know, whatever, but...

3827
03:10:39,420 --> 03:10:39,860
I've...

3828
03:10:40,360 --> 03:10:41,600
Wanted to try, you know?

3829
03:10:43,700 --> 03:10:45,700
But, recently, I've been...

3830
03:10:45,700 --> 03:10:46,520
I, like, sometimes...

3831
03:10:47,100 --> 03:10:48,740
Get, uh...

3832
03:10:48,740 --> 03:10:49,160
Fire...

3833
03:10:49,160 --> 03:10:49,900
People, like...

3834
03:10:50,310 --> 03:10:51,820
Who work firewatches.

3835
03:10:51,960 --> 03:10:52,980
I get them on TikTok.

3836
03:10:53,360 --> 03:10:55,480
And just, like, them talking about, like...

3837
03:10:55,480 --> 03:10:56,520
A day in the life...

3838
03:10:57,040 --> 03:10:57,760
As a...

3839
03:10:57,760 --> 03:10:58,880
As a...

3840
03:10:59,410 --> 03:11:00,240
Firewatch ranger.

3841
03:11:00,740 --> 03:11:01,400
Things like that.

3842
03:11:02,080 --> 03:11:02,620
Caretaker.

3843
03:11:04,900 --> 03:11:05,980
And, uh...

3844
03:11:06,820 --> 03:11:08,900
Lighthouse caretaker is my firewatch.

3845
03:11:08,980 --> 03:11:09,460
Oh my god.

3846
03:11:09,860 --> 03:11:11,200
I think I would probably...

3847
03:11:11,200 --> 03:11:11,720
Foxtrot!

3848
03:11:11,720 --> 03:11:14,320
I think I would probably prefer a lighthouse too.

3849
03:11:14,520 --> 03:11:15,660
But those are...

3850
03:11:15,660 --> 03:11:16,600
Haunted.

3851
03:11:17,520 --> 03:11:18,980
Perfect place for me, huh?

3852
03:11:19,680 --> 03:11:20,640
But, um...

3853
03:11:20,640 --> 03:11:21,680
I saw one recently.

3854
03:11:21,840 --> 03:11:23,460
I have a lady who was just like...

3855
03:11:23,460 --> 03:11:25,680
I work at a firewatch.

3856
03:11:25,680 --> 03:11:27,780
And it's, like, literally middle of nowhere.

3857
03:11:29,320 --> 03:11:29,800
And...

3858
03:11:30,880 --> 03:11:31,840
A guy...

3859
03:11:31,840 --> 03:11:33,740
Came to my firewatch.

3860
03:11:35,680 --> 03:11:36,280
Like...

3861
03:11:36,280 --> 03:11:36,940
Like, and she was like...

3862
03:11:36,940 --> 03:11:37,500
I don't know.

3863
03:11:37,860 --> 03:11:39,760
Like, it's very hard to...

3864
03:11:40,840 --> 03:11:44,020
Like, just stumble upon my firewatch.

3865
03:11:45,380 --> 03:11:45,980
How?

3866
03:11:47,720 --> 03:11:49,280
How did he find it?

3867
03:11:49,360 --> 03:11:49,940
How did he...

3868
03:11:49,940 --> 03:11:50,240
How?

3869
03:11:56,490 --> 03:11:57,530
I heard you.

3870
03:11:59,430 --> 03:12:00,910
I saw that TikTok too?

3871
03:12:01,170 --> 03:12:01,310
Yeah!

3872
03:12:02,710 --> 03:12:04,710
That's why I wouldn't do firewatch.

3873
03:12:04,930 --> 03:12:06,630
I think it's a very...

3874
03:12:06,630 --> 03:12:07,990
Oh, I see it!

3875
03:12:08,150 --> 03:12:09,890
I think it's a very rare occurrence...

3876
03:12:09,890 --> 03:12:10,750
Considering how...

3877
03:12:11,550 --> 03:12:13,830
Remote firewatch towers are...

3878
03:12:13,830 --> 03:12:15,490
In general, but...

3879
03:12:15,490 --> 03:12:16,670
Wow, that thing...

3880
03:12:16,670 --> 03:12:17,830
Got some air!

3881
03:12:18,950 --> 03:12:19,430
There...

3882
03:12:25,370 --> 03:12:25,850
Yeah!

3883
03:12:29,810 --> 03:12:30,850
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

3884
03:12:31,090 --> 03:12:31,310
I'm...

3885
03:12:31,310 --> 03:12:32,490
I'm sprinting and running.

3886
03:12:36,970 --> 03:12:37,930
But, um...

3887
03:12:38,290 --> 03:12:39,750
Yeah, I don't know...

3888
03:12:40,350 --> 03:12:41,950
Seems like it would be just really nice...

3889
03:12:41,950 --> 03:12:43,470
To wake up, and like...

3890
03:12:44,270 --> 03:12:45,410
But I think I've...

3891
03:12:45,410 --> 03:12:47,950
Maybe I've played also too many horror games...

3892
03:12:47,950 --> 03:12:49,670
About firewatches...

3893
03:12:50,630 --> 03:12:52,130
For me to...

3894
03:12:52,130 --> 03:12:55,130
Be okay about it.

3895
03:13:06,050 --> 03:13:06,850
Is that my tummy?

3896
03:13:18,190 --> 03:13:19,130
Oh, my bad.

3897
03:13:22,710 --> 03:13:26,470
Holy cow, I went through two... Wait, I think I had four MREs.

3898
03:13:26,550 --> 03:13:27,630
No, and I went through two of them?

3899
03:13:29,730 --> 03:13:31,070
Hungry camper over here.

3900
03:13:35,600 --> 03:13:36,460
Where's my TV?

3901
03:13:39,700 --> 03:13:41,860
Okay, this time I'll learn how to park it.

3902
03:13:43,700 --> 03:13:44,760
If I can find it.

3903
03:13:46,240 --> 03:13:46,580
Wait.

3904
03:13:54,630 --> 03:13:55,750
I lost it.

3905
03:13:57,590 --> 03:13:58,150
Wait.

3906
03:14:05,220 --> 03:14:06,460
There it is!

3907
03:14:10,100 --> 03:14:12,280
I forgot it was across the river.

3908
03:14:14,320 --> 03:14:14,980
Okay.

3909
03:14:16,320 --> 03:14:17,240
Let's drive.

3910
03:14:19,590 --> 03:14:21,080
Can't drive while holding an object.

3911
03:14:21,520 --> 03:14:22,880
I'm holding the keys.

3912
03:14:28,220 --> 03:14:28,880
Oh.

3913
03:14:29,720 --> 03:14:30,860
Watch for trees.

3914
03:14:33,190 --> 03:14:35,220
I don't think I can afford another accident.

3915
03:14:35,220 --> 03:14:35,340
I don't think I can afford it.

3916
03:14:46,690 --> 03:14:47,570
We're fine.

3917
03:14:47,950 --> 03:14:48,650
Don't worry about it.

3918
03:14:51,350 --> 03:14:52,230
Okay, well...

3919
03:14:52,230 --> 03:14:54,650
I was gonna go to that one over there, but we'll go to this one.

3920
03:14:54,750 --> 03:14:55,270
Because it's close.

3921
03:14:57,710 --> 03:14:58,330
What's this?

3922
03:14:59,730 --> 03:15:00,610
Charlie Delta...

3923
03:15:00,610 --> 03:15:01,190
Base.

3924
03:15:03,310 --> 03:15:03,750
No.

3925
03:15:04,750 --> 03:15:05,530
What are you?

3926
03:15:05,530 --> 03:15:07,630
You are...

3927
03:15:09,770 --> 03:15:11,170
Whiskey!

3928
03:15:12,710 --> 03:15:14,210
The whiskey...

3929
03:15:14,210 --> 03:15:14,570
Totem.

3930
03:15:23,360 --> 03:15:25,020
Okay, someone said...

3931
03:15:25,500 --> 03:15:26,240
Breaks.

3932
03:15:27,160 --> 03:15:27,820
Thank you!

3933
03:15:28,300 --> 03:15:28,880
Thank you!

3934
03:15:29,240 --> 03:15:29,460
Okay.

3935
03:15:31,040 --> 03:15:32,600
All right...

3936
03:15:32,600 --> 03:15:33,820
Wait, one second...

3937
03:15:33,820 --> 03:15:34,520
Guys...

3938
03:15:34,520 --> 03:15:35,000
These...

3939
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:35,520
Uh...

3940
03:15:36,460 --> 03:15:36,880
Hidoki.

3941
03:15:37,060 --> 03:15:37,180
Okay.

3942
03:15:42,670 --> 03:15:43,510
Does...

3943
03:15:43,510 --> 03:15:44,550
Sprinting...

3944
03:15:44,550 --> 03:15:44,970
Uh...

3945
03:15:44,970 --> 03:15:45,770
Lower my...

3946
03:15:45,770 --> 03:15:46,490
Stamina?

3947
03:15:46,790 --> 03:15:47,570
Because, uh...

3948
03:15:48,430 --> 03:15:49,710
If I...

3949
03:15:49,710 --> 03:15:50,690
Run out of stamina...

3950
03:15:50,910 --> 03:15:51,390
What happens?

3951
03:15:55,630 --> 03:15:56,470
Lima...

3952
03:16:05,220 --> 03:16:06,920
This is not as effective...

3953
03:16:06,920 --> 03:16:09,040
How many satellites are there?

3954
03:16:11,020 --> 03:16:12,260
Holy cow!

3955
03:16:14,260 --> 03:16:15,240
There's so many!

3956
03:16:18,630 --> 03:16:20,130
Is that one over there?

3957
03:16:21,110 --> 03:16:21,490
Uh...

3958
03:16:21,490 --> 03:16:22,050
Oh...

3959
03:16:22,050 --> 03:16:22,950
Oh, here we go.

3960
03:16:27,090 --> 03:16:27,850
24?

3961
03:16:34,260 --> 03:16:35,020
Okay...

3962
03:16:35,020 --> 03:16:36,760
How many letters in the alphabet?

3963
03:16:37,300 --> 03:16:38,380
You're kidding me.

3964
03:16:43,930 --> 03:16:45,350
Is that my base?

3965
03:16:45,550 --> 03:16:45,930
Yeah.

3966
03:16:48,310 --> 03:16:50,590
What if I saw from far away...

3967
03:16:50,590 --> 03:16:52,070
Like someone set it on fire?

3968
03:16:55,410 --> 03:16:56,550
That'd be crazy.

3969
03:17:08,090 --> 03:17:08,550
Kilo...

3970
03:17:09,810 --> 03:17:11,850
Okay, I give up on this daily task.

3971
03:17:12,050 --> 03:17:13,210
I'm gonna go get the drone...

3972
03:17:13,210 --> 03:17:15,050
So we can at least buy some trash bags.

3973
03:17:22,210 --> 03:17:23,690
Server needs fixing here.

3974
03:17:28,410 --> 03:17:29,810
Here.

3975
03:17:29,810 --> 03:17:30,410
That's my job!

3976
03:17:31,010 --> 03:17:32,110
Wait, how do you know?

3977
03:17:32,750 --> 03:17:33,450
Here!

3978
03:17:35,830 --> 03:17:37,230
Three...

3979
03:17:37,230 --> 03:17:37,930
Zero...

3980
03:17:38,810 --> 03:17:39,510
Six...

3981
03:17:44,050 --> 03:17:45,190
Thirteen...

3982
03:17:45,190 --> 03:17:46,230
Three...

3983
03:17:46,230 --> 03:17:46,930
Four...

3984
03:17:47,410 --> 03:17:48,270
Five...

3985
03:17:49,310 --> 03:17:50,770
Four...

3986
03:18:03,180 --> 03:18:11,380
The target command on the console sets the waypoint.

3987
03:18:11,380 --> 03:18:11,560
The target command on the console sets the waypoint.

3988
03:18:15,020 --> 03:18:17,860
You know what my brain just did with what you said?

3989
03:18:26,740 --> 03:18:27,900
Let's go back home.

3990
03:18:28,140 --> 03:18:29,500
I give up on this task.

3991
03:18:37,050 --> 03:18:37,650
Oops.

3992
03:18:37,890 --> 03:18:37,990
Oops.

3993
03:18:38,130 --> 03:18:39,630
I didn't run into it.

3994
03:18:39,830 --> 03:18:40,890
That hard.

3995
03:18:43,270 --> 03:18:43,890
Are we okay?

3996
03:18:46,230 --> 03:18:47,450
Just a little bit of blood.

3997
03:18:51,810 --> 03:18:52,990
LOL, I tried.

3998
03:18:53,250 --> 03:18:53,610
You did.

3999
03:18:54,010 --> 03:18:54,950
You know what?

4000
03:18:55,210 --> 03:18:56,450
You really did.

4001
03:18:56,750 --> 03:18:58,230
I appreciate it.

4002
03:18:58,230 --> 03:19:00,820
I think these whiskey poles are just...

4003
03:19:01,330 --> 03:19:04,090
Testing me if I'll crash and...

4004
03:19:04,090 --> 03:19:04,270
Die.

4005
03:19:05,440 --> 03:19:06,950
I wonder what my health is at.

4006
03:19:08,490 --> 03:19:10,350
Maybe we should use the med kit.

4007
03:19:16,400 --> 03:19:18,160
I'm pulling in hot!

4008
03:19:20,440 --> 03:19:21,840
Actually not so hot.

4009
03:19:22,280 --> 03:19:23,660
It's actually pretty chill.

4010
03:19:25,380 --> 03:19:27,280
Oh, I gotta get that garbage away.

4011
03:19:27,480 --> 03:19:28,780
Okay, we're gonna call for the drone!

4012
03:19:29,420 --> 03:19:30,260
Oh my god.

4013
03:19:30,540 --> 03:19:32,520
I thought that fence was something creepy.

4014
03:19:33,600 --> 03:19:36,080
I thought this was like something crawling out of the bush.

4015
03:19:38,120 --> 03:19:38,780
What's this?

4016
03:19:39,980 --> 03:19:40,460
No...

4017
03:19:40,460 --> 03:19:40,920
Something.

4018
03:19:42,500 --> 03:19:43,680
Did I see a raindrop?

4019
03:19:51,450 --> 03:19:53,130
Yeah, we need a trash bag.

4020
03:19:53,830 --> 03:19:55,010
Oh, it is a raindrop!

4021
03:19:56,890 --> 03:19:57,830
Starting to rain.

4022
03:20:00,110 --> 03:20:00,550
Hmm.

4023
03:20:03,550 --> 03:20:04,550
Does this need gas?

4024
03:20:06,610 --> 03:20:07,470
The ATV?

4025
03:20:08,270 --> 03:20:09,810
I didn't see a gas...

4026
03:20:10,330 --> 03:20:10,770
Indicator.

4027
03:20:16,950 --> 03:20:17,390
Okay.

4028
03:20:18,710 --> 03:20:19,150
There...

4029
03:20:19,150 --> 03:20:21,610
I don't know how to put this back on the wall, first of all.

4030
03:20:21,750 --> 03:20:22,370
Okay, hold it.

4031
03:20:22,590 --> 03:20:23,750
Oh, here we go.

4032
03:20:24,130 --> 03:20:25,810
I figured it out on my own.

4033
03:20:25,810 --> 03:20:26,090
I'm...

4034
03:20:34,410 --> 03:20:36,150
Now, you guys...

4035
03:20:36,150 --> 03:20:38,710
Now, you guys...

4036
03:20:39,030 --> 03:20:40,190
You guys...

4037
03:20:40,190 --> 03:20:41,750
Are gonna fault me.

4038
03:20:44,030 --> 03:20:49,830
For not knowing where things are, when this is the map?

4039
03:20:50,330 --> 03:20:52,030
Excuse me?

4040
03:20:54,250 --> 03:20:55,110
Yes.

4041
03:20:56,330 --> 03:20:58,730
Is A our base?

4042
03:20:59,190 --> 03:21:00,930
Is B base?

4043
03:21:11,140 --> 03:21:16,540
You're gonna fault me, you're gonna be like, well you took down the map, stupid.

4044
03:21:18,280 --> 03:21:20,180
When this...

4045
03:21:21,540 --> 03:21:23,180
Looks like an eye test.

4046
03:21:25,080 --> 03:21:26,040
Whoa.

4047
03:21:28,500 --> 03:21:31,660
Is this from the rain, or...

4048
03:21:32,540 --> 03:21:34,600
Didn't you guys say something about fog?

4049
03:21:43,540 --> 03:21:46,100
Um, it's... hold on.

4050
03:21:46,600 --> 03:21:50,880
It says... it said, save... no.

4051
03:21:54,270 --> 03:21:55,990
It says I can't save.

4052
03:22:02,780 --> 03:22:04,300
Wait, am I not paused?

4053
03:22:15,510 --> 03:22:16,730
What do I do?

4054
03:22:18,350 --> 03:22:19,050
Radar.

4055
03:22:25,700 --> 03:22:26,920
Let's have four.

4056
03:22:32,150 --> 03:22:32,550
Save.

4057
03:22:39,320 --> 03:22:39,840
Uh...

4058
03:22:44,950 --> 03:22:46,630
Wait, I didn't... I didn't press anything.

4059
03:22:46,870 --> 03:22:48,210
I didn't... I didn't press anything.

4060
03:22:48,590 --> 03:22:50,290
I didn't try... I didn't try to save.

4061
03:22:51,030 --> 03:22:52,210
Maybe the game tried to save.

4062
03:22:54,470 --> 03:22:55,290
What's moving?

4063
03:23:07,070 --> 03:23:09,130
I don't wanna go towards my doors!

4064
03:23:12,790 --> 03:23:13,970
Chad is scaring me.

4065
03:23:14,010 --> 03:23:14,730
They're scaring me!

4066
03:23:15,690 --> 03:23:17,530
I don't even know how to lock the door!

4067
03:23:18,590 --> 03:23:19,810
How do I lock the door?

4068
03:23:20,670 --> 03:23:22,070
I think it's time to lock the door.

4069
03:23:22,490 --> 03:23:23,490
How do I lock it?

4070
03:23:23,550 --> 03:23:24,490
It's already inside.

4071
03:23:24,690 --> 03:23:25,230
Wait, what do you mean?

4072
03:23:28,330 --> 03:23:29,230
Lock the door!

4073
03:23:29,930 --> 03:23:30,330
It's...

4074
03:23:40,960 --> 03:23:42,040
Oh gosh, scary.

4075
03:23:43,280 --> 03:23:45,580
Use the panels beside the door.

4076
03:23:47,900 --> 03:23:50,680
Touch the keypad to lock the door.

4077
03:23:57,620 --> 03:24:00,040
I don't think that was, uh...

4078
03:24:00,040 --> 03:24:00,240
Wait!

4079
03:24:01,790 --> 03:24:02,460
Is it gone?

4080
03:24:05,780 --> 03:24:06,880
It's not...

4081
03:24:11,510 --> 03:24:12,520
The fog is gone.

4082
03:24:12,760 --> 03:24:13,200
I think.

4083
03:24:17,260 --> 03:24:17,960
No?

4084
03:24:17,960 --> 03:24:19,760
Still won't let me save.

4085
03:24:27,930 --> 03:24:29,050
Look outside!

4086
03:24:36,520 --> 03:24:37,220
Check!

4087
03:24:39,910 --> 03:24:41,160
Turning down the...

4088
03:24:42,840 --> 03:24:44,700
I'm turning down the volume.

4089
03:24:45,220 --> 03:24:46,300
I don't wanna get jump scared.

4090
03:24:53,570 --> 03:24:55,350
There's a hole under the desk?

4091
03:24:57,730 --> 03:24:58,430
Oh.

4092
03:24:59,470 --> 03:25:00,350
Oh.

4093
03:25:00,450 --> 03:25:01,450
Oh yeah, I can see everything.

4094
03:25:04,150 --> 03:25:05,330
Oh yeah.

4095
03:25:08,430 --> 03:25:09,310
Uh...

4096
03:25:09,310 --> 03:25:10,430
Yeah.

4097
03:25:10,990 --> 03:25:12,170
How do I clean the window?

4098
03:25:17,390 --> 03:25:18,730
He's gone!

4099
03:25:19,610 --> 03:25:21,290
Whatever it was.

4100
03:25:23,290 --> 03:25:24,130
It's gone.

4101
03:25:31,070 --> 03:25:33,750
Oh, maybe nothing was moving after all.

4102
03:25:43,650 --> 03:25:47,510
Oh my gosh, it's so early, but my stamina is running out.

4103
03:25:52,730 --> 03:25:54,570
A sponge in the shower?

4104
03:25:56,250 --> 03:25:56,930
Really?

4105
03:25:59,430 --> 03:26:01,870
He has a sponge after dropping it into water.

4106
03:26:02,030 --> 03:26:02,670
Seriously?

4107
03:26:13,430 --> 03:26:14,110
Uh...

4108
03:26:15,990 --> 03:26:16,970
There's another dot.

4109
03:26:19,430 --> 03:26:20,770
Far, far away.

4110
03:26:27,070 --> 03:26:28,010
Far away.

4111
03:26:30,210 --> 03:26:32,610
This is like the sun setting music though, no?

4112
03:26:32,790 --> 03:26:34,270
This is the sun setting ambiance.

4113
03:26:49,600 --> 03:26:51,180
Okay, let's go get the sponge.

4114
03:26:51,680 --> 03:26:52,560
Even though I'm scared.

4115
03:26:55,100 --> 03:26:55,860
There.

4116
03:26:55,860 --> 03:26:56,000
Right.

4117
03:26:57,240 --> 03:26:59,000
See, I couldn't lock this door.

4118
03:26:59,680 --> 03:27:01,420
But I can lock...

4119
03:27:01,420 --> 03:27:02,780
This door, right?

4120
03:27:09,220 --> 03:27:09,900
Like that?

4121
03:27:23,710 --> 03:27:24,470
Okay.

4122
03:27:27,030 --> 03:27:28,010
Sleep demon?

4123
03:27:33,280 --> 03:27:34,900
There should be no demons.

4124
03:27:35,360 --> 03:27:37,140
Wait, why is my head tilting so much?

4125
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:38,880
You see that?

4126
03:27:46,700 --> 03:27:48,860
There should be no demons in this game.

4127
03:27:49,820 --> 03:27:50,440
Only...

4128
03:27:52,140 --> 03:27:52,760
Only...

4129
03:27:52,760 --> 03:27:53,400
Aliens.

4130
03:27:54,080 --> 03:27:55,100
The concussion?

4131
03:27:57,440 --> 03:27:58,900
Okay, I'll go to sleep.

4132
03:28:10,360 --> 03:28:11,320
Please shut.

4133
03:28:11,780 --> 03:28:12,320
Shut.

4134
03:28:12,720 --> 03:28:13,000
Shut.

4135
03:28:13,480 --> 03:28:13,980
Thank you.

4136
03:28:14,580 --> 03:28:15,760
And then we can get the sponge.

4137
03:28:16,140 --> 03:28:17,960
And we can clean it in the morning.

4138
03:28:19,960 --> 03:28:20,660
Oh.

4139
03:28:25,260 --> 03:28:26,820
I forgot to...

4140
03:28:26,820 --> 03:28:28,630
I forgot to do the...

4141
03:28:29,120 --> 03:28:29,800
Daily task.

4142
03:28:33,500 --> 03:28:34,640
Oh my gosh.

4143
03:28:34,980 --> 03:28:35,800
So much lightning.

4144
03:28:40,800 --> 03:28:41,360
Interesting.

4145
03:28:41,360 --> 03:28:42,160
She locked the doors?

4146
03:28:42,400 --> 03:28:44,040
Yeah, I locked the doors.

4147
03:28:45,220 --> 03:28:46,620
Maybe not all of them.

4148
03:28:49,980 --> 03:28:51,120
Oh, it's dark.

4149
03:28:53,440 --> 03:28:54,700
It's so dark.

4150
03:29:02,880 --> 03:29:04,320
Did you close the garage?

4151
03:29:04,620 --> 03:29:04,820
No.

4152
03:29:05,620 --> 03:29:06,820
Did you turn off the oven?

4153
03:29:08,640 --> 03:29:09,200
Maybe.

4154
03:29:11,860 --> 03:29:13,400
Did I see something just...

4155
03:29:13,400 --> 03:29:14,560
Zoom past...

4156
03:29:14,560 --> 03:29:15,160
On the ground?

4157
03:29:15,640 --> 03:29:17,160
My big head might have blocked it.

4158
03:29:20,540 --> 03:29:21,420
Oh, oh!

4159
03:29:21,560 --> 03:29:22,180
What was that?

4160
03:29:23,460 --> 03:29:24,380
What was that?

4161
03:29:24,640 --> 03:29:25,640
Something in the trees!

4162
03:29:25,760 --> 03:29:25,880
Oh.

4163
03:29:26,120 --> 03:29:26,720
Oh my gosh.

4164
03:29:30,190 --> 03:29:32,050
It freaks me out when I just...

4165
03:29:32,050 --> 03:29:32,950
Wake up like that.

4166
03:29:33,250 --> 03:29:34,250
Who I am!

4167
03:29:36,590 --> 03:29:37,370
Uh oh.

4168
03:29:41,250 --> 03:29:41,970
Oh.

4169
03:29:45,950 --> 03:29:46,670
Oh.

4170
03:29:46,670 --> 03:29:49,430
Real ga- Oh yeah, this is the jet lag simulator.

4171
03:29:52,410 --> 03:29:52,770
Oh.

4172
03:29:54,090 --> 03:29:54,810
Okay.

4173
03:29:57,250 --> 03:29:59,310
There's a mannequin in here, guys.

4174
03:29:59,610 --> 03:30:01,750
I like how the...

4175
03:30:02,590 --> 03:30:03,750
Freezer's called smug.

4176
03:30:03,750 --> 03:30:05,730
We can make shrimp!

4177
03:30:10,290 --> 03:30:12,330
There's a mannequin in here.

4178
03:30:14,590 --> 03:30:16,550
You don't scare me.

4179
03:30:23,450 --> 03:30:24,370
There we go.

4180
03:30:26,710 --> 03:30:27,350
Soap.

4181
03:30:28,430 --> 03:30:29,010
Sponge.

4182
03:30:29,430 --> 03:30:29,890
Collect.

4183
03:30:29,890 --> 03:30:30,710
Okay.

4184
03:30:30,790 --> 03:30:31,530
I got the spot.

4185
03:30:32,210 --> 03:30:32,630
Ew!

4186
03:30:33,970 --> 03:30:34,450
Oh.

4187
03:30:34,630 --> 03:30:34,850
Oh.

4188
03:30:35,410 --> 03:30:35,710
Use.

4189
03:30:36,190 --> 03:30:37,010
What do you mean, use?

4190
03:30:43,740 --> 03:30:44,220
Oh.

4191
03:30:48,180 --> 03:30:49,040
Wait, where'd he go?

4192
03:30:50,440 --> 03:30:51,120
Where'd he go?

4193
03:30:52,000 --> 03:30:52,200
Oh.

4194
03:30:53,140 --> 03:30:53,620
Use.

4195
03:30:53,620 --> 03:30:53,700
Use.

4196
03:30:57,480 --> 03:30:58,160
Oh, whoa.

4197
03:31:00,360 --> 03:31:00,880
Uh.

4198
03:31:01,280 --> 03:31:02,220
What does it mean?

4199
03:31:08,290 --> 03:31:08,610
Boo!

4200
03:31:09,890 --> 03:31:11,810
Even though I put it on the ground.

4201
03:31:12,350 --> 03:31:13,630
Did not scare me.

4202
03:31:13,790 --> 03:31:14,450
It still...

4203
03:31:14,450 --> 03:31:15,730
It scared me even more.

4204
03:31:16,210 --> 03:31:17,290
Eat the soap!

4205
03:31:22,780 --> 03:31:24,900
I would do that if I said a bad word.

4206
03:31:26,240 --> 03:31:27,500
I would eat the soap.

4207
03:31:28,160 --> 03:31:29,680
Did your parents ever make you do that?

4208
03:31:34,760 --> 03:31:37,860
I think my mom made me do it once and then felt bad.

4209
03:31:44,970 --> 03:31:46,590
I did it on my own volition.

4210
03:31:47,310 --> 03:31:47,510
Okay.

4211
03:31:47,990 --> 03:31:49,270
That is...

4212
03:31:54,270 --> 03:31:55,590
I'm not dirty.

4213
03:32:01,550 --> 03:32:02,630
Oh my gosh.

4214
03:32:03,010 --> 03:32:03,510
I...

4215
03:32:03,510 --> 03:32:06,430
When I stay at a new place, I get scared.

4216
03:32:07,450 --> 03:32:10,610
And so I like to shower with the door open.

4217
03:32:10,950 --> 03:32:12,470
But in Japan...

4218
03:32:13,470 --> 03:32:14,110
They...

4219
03:32:21,420 --> 03:32:22,840
They yell at you.

4220
03:32:24,080 --> 03:32:29,040
And they're like, don't shower with the door open because it will make the alarm go off.

4221
03:32:33,210 --> 03:32:35,350
Lights are flickering for no reason.

4222
03:32:37,150 --> 03:32:37,550
Yeah.

4223
03:32:39,370 --> 03:32:40,470
No reason.

4224
03:32:41,210 --> 03:32:41,770
Right?

4225
03:32:43,870 --> 03:32:45,450
Did the alarm go off?

4226
03:32:45,570 --> 03:32:46,110
Well, I...

4227
03:32:46,110 --> 03:32:47,570
I just...

4228
03:32:47,570 --> 03:32:48,970
I just...

4229
03:32:59,090 --> 03:33:01,350
Don't do it, but I'm scared.

4230
03:33:04,330 --> 03:33:05,570
How do I get it wet?

4231
03:33:13,270 --> 03:33:14,390
How do I clean?

4232
03:33:16,890 --> 03:33:18,810
With the sponge using the bucket.

4233
03:33:19,110 --> 03:33:19,710
Bucket.

4234
03:33:20,380 --> 03:33:21,030
The toilet?

4235
03:33:25,520 --> 03:33:25,890
Advancement.

4236
03:33:26,050 --> 03:33:26,270
Burger.

4237
03:33:26,590 --> 03:33:28,230
Oh, I got an achievement for the burger.

4238
03:33:33,870 --> 03:33:35,470
Plus five stamina.

4239
03:33:35,870 --> 03:33:37,170
We're going potty?

4240
03:33:40,430 --> 03:33:41,170
Use.

4241
03:33:42,030 --> 03:33:42,670
Right?

4242
03:33:46,920 --> 03:33:48,030
How resourceful.

4243
03:33:50,130 --> 03:33:51,110
Um...

4244
03:33:52,290 --> 03:33:54,390
Use a bucket of water.

4245
03:33:55,450 --> 03:33:57,550
I don't think I have that.

4246
03:34:04,700 --> 03:34:05,190
Oh.

4247
03:34:06,120 --> 03:34:06,620
Wait.

4248
03:34:08,560 --> 03:34:09,050
Um...

4249
03:34:11,870 --> 03:34:12,910
Will the sink work?

4250
03:34:15,860 --> 03:34:16,350
Wait.

4251
03:34:16,610 --> 03:34:17,430
If I...

4252
03:34:17,740 --> 03:34:18,230
Sponge.

4253
03:34:18,770 --> 03:34:19,490
Hold.

4254
03:34:20,490 --> 03:34:21,490
Oops.

4255
03:34:22,710 --> 03:34:24,110
Uh...

4256
03:34:27,780 --> 03:34:29,220
Like that?

4257
03:34:39,030 --> 03:34:40,070
There we go.

4258
03:34:42,210 --> 03:34:43,770
Become wet.

4259
03:34:46,550 --> 03:34:47,690
Hold and click.

4260
03:34:49,890 --> 03:34:51,070
Oh.

4261
03:34:52,470 --> 03:34:53,850
Did that do it?

4262
03:35:00,610 --> 03:35:01,310
Uh...

4263
03:35:04,830 --> 03:35:05,310
Huh.

4264
03:35:07,030 --> 03:35:09,310
I did try holding it, but...

4265
03:35:09,310 --> 03:35:09,430
Oh!

4266
03:35:09,550 --> 03:35:10,730
I can heal my wounds!

4267
03:35:11,330 --> 03:35:12,670
I don't need it right now.

4268
03:35:12,870 --> 03:35:14,070
I'm totally fine.

4269
03:35:14,530 --> 03:35:14,870
Apparently.

4270
03:35:17,770 --> 03:35:19,070
I'm totally fine.

4271
03:35:20,890 --> 03:35:23,190
Yeah, let's try the shower in the signal room.

4272
03:35:23,210 --> 03:35:24,230
I was thinking that one too.

4273
03:35:26,150 --> 03:35:27,830
Are the lights gonna go out?

4274
03:35:28,710 --> 03:35:29,190
Is...

4275
03:35:29,190 --> 03:35:31,130
Am I using too much power or something?

4276
03:35:31,430 --> 03:35:32,670
Oh, it's already 4am.

4277
03:35:37,660 --> 03:35:38,180
Um...

4278
03:35:38,180 --> 03:35:39,100
Well, the transformers...

4279
03:35:39,760 --> 03:35:40,380
Where are those?

4280
03:35:40,580 --> 03:35:42,260
You have to check the transformers.

4281
03:35:42,940 --> 03:35:43,960
Where are those?

4282
03:35:45,180 --> 03:35:46,600
They will go out.

4283
03:35:49,740 --> 03:35:50,780
I'm scared!

4284
03:35:52,860 --> 03:35:55,500
TR check to check the transformers.

4285
03:35:56,400 --> 03:35:56,920
Okay.

4286
03:35:57,060 --> 03:35:57,940
I'm gonna go back to sleep.

4287
03:35:59,800 --> 03:36:01,360
I do wanna sleep!

4288
03:36:01,360 --> 03:36:02,540
Ha ha ha ha ha.

4289
03:36:03,260 --> 03:36:04,360
Ronnie, welcome to membership.

4290
03:36:04,540 --> 03:36:05,060
Thank you!

4291
03:36:05,680 --> 03:36:07,100
Oh my gosh, you guys.

4292
03:36:07,220 --> 03:36:08,720
I didn't lock this door!

4293
03:36:13,750 --> 03:36:16,050
I didn't lock this door before!

4294
03:36:16,630 --> 03:36:17,030
Oh!

4295
03:36:18,770 --> 03:36:21,170
If the power goes out, the doors will unlock.

4296
03:36:22,190 --> 03:36:22,350
Oh.

4297
03:36:29,660 --> 03:36:31,020
Should I lock the garage door?

4298
03:36:31,560 --> 03:36:32,200
Uh, yeah.

4299
03:36:33,500 --> 03:36:34,100
Yeah.

4300
03:36:35,660 --> 03:36:37,460
Well, I think we're okay right now.

4301
03:36:38,920 --> 03:36:39,360
Mm-hm.

4302
03:36:39,500 --> 03:36:40,740
I guess I'll just go back downstairs.

4303
03:36:44,980 --> 03:36:46,540
We'll try and clean the window.

4304
03:37:00,500 --> 03:37:01,730
So I just...

4305
03:37:04,000 --> 03:37:04,660
Nope.

4306
03:37:07,270 --> 03:37:07,720
Uh-oh.

4307
03:37:14,570 --> 03:37:14,970
Collect?

4308
03:37:15,910 --> 03:37:17,110
Is it wet now?

4309
03:37:18,150 --> 03:37:19,430
Wait, there's a sponge!

4310
03:37:19,610 --> 03:37:20,470
Oh, there really is!

4311
03:37:21,550 --> 03:37:22,590
It's someone's...

4312
03:37:22,590 --> 03:37:23,630
Glass trash!

4313
03:37:24,570 --> 03:37:25,870
Crouch, then left click.

4314
03:37:26,130 --> 03:37:26,570
Okay, okay.

4315
03:37:26,970 --> 03:37:28,150
I need to be holding it.

4316
03:37:35,540 --> 03:37:36,300
It's wet?

4317
03:37:41,410 --> 03:37:42,570
Oh my gosh!

4318
03:37:42,830 --> 03:37:43,470
It works!

4319
03:37:55,380 --> 03:37:58,160
How do people figure out how to do this, you know?

4320
03:37:59,440 --> 03:38:00,400
It's crazy.

4321
03:38:02,440 --> 03:38:03,820
Well, I think my tummy's growing.

4322
03:38:05,020 --> 03:38:05,620
No?

4323
03:38:06,120 --> 03:38:06,280
No?

4324
03:38:06,380 --> 03:38:07,780
Actually, I don't know what that is.

4325
03:38:09,520 --> 03:38:12,120
Power wash simulator all of a sudden.

4326
03:38:16,030 --> 03:38:18,210
Been playing it for two years.

4327
03:38:18,810 --> 03:38:19,090
Jeez.

4328
03:38:20,290 --> 03:38:21,470
And like...

4329
03:38:22,430 --> 03:38:25,050
The full game is not out?

4330
03:38:25,270 --> 03:38:25,750
Question mark?

4331
03:38:30,940 --> 03:38:32,940
I'm doing my job as a maid.

4332
03:38:33,300 --> 03:38:35,060
How long do I have until...

4333
03:38:36,140 --> 03:38:36,920
Oh, sorry.

4334
03:38:37,080 --> 03:38:37,360
I've...

4335
03:38:37,360 --> 03:38:37,700
Oh my gosh.

4336
03:38:37,780 --> 03:38:39,240
I've been using my flashlight this whole time.

4337
03:38:39,540 --> 03:38:41,420
How long until it's not wet anymore?

4338
03:38:43,920 --> 03:38:44,860
Still in alpha.

4339
03:38:45,120 --> 03:38:45,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4340
03:38:49,930 --> 03:38:50,850
Rinse your sponge.

4341
03:38:56,330 --> 03:38:57,630
What do you do in this game?

4342
03:38:57,810 --> 03:38:58,530
Like, everything.

4343
03:39:01,210 --> 03:39:02,950
You do so much in this game.

4344
03:39:05,790 --> 03:39:06,590
Oh yeah.

4345
03:39:07,230 --> 03:39:08,110
Oh yeah.

4346
03:39:09,670 --> 03:39:10,950
Not a speck...

4347
03:39:11,590 --> 03:39:12,110
Left.

4348
03:39:14,490 --> 03:39:15,790
I'm kinda scared now.

4349
03:39:15,930 --> 03:39:17,030
Now I can see out my windows.

4350
03:39:17,810 --> 03:39:19,930
I can see if there's something standing there.

4351
03:39:21,230 --> 03:39:22,910
Well, sometimes they just be standing there.

4352
03:39:24,330 --> 03:39:25,970
Some sort of little evil creature.

4353
03:39:28,610 --> 03:39:29,490
Plushy Minto.

4354
03:39:37,690 --> 03:39:39,460
Whatever is there can see you too.

4355
03:39:40,320 --> 03:39:41,100
Shut up.

4356
03:39:42,900 --> 03:39:43,520
No!

4357
03:39:46,760 --> 03:39:49,140
The creature will be able to see you too.

4358
03:39:57,950 --> 03:39:58,570
No!

4359
03:39:58,850 --> 03:40:00,170
My windows are tinted!

4360
03:40:03,610 --> 03:40:05,630
Don't say that, you guys!

4361
03:40:09,110 --> 03:40:10,530
They're lying.

4362
03:40:21,740 --> 03:40:23,960
Where do you get your windows tinted?

4363
03:40:26,420 --> 03:40:27,960
Vogel's been tinted.

4364
03:40:37,210 --> 03:40:37,670
Okay.

4365
03:40:38,230 --> 03:40:39,730
Oh yeah, thank you.

4366
03:40:40,950 --> 03:40:42,690
The transformers.

4367
03:40:44,870 --> 03:40:46,030
Oh no!

4368
03:40:46,490 --> 03:40:46,730
Uh-oh.

4369
03:40:47,090 --> 03:40:47,930
Uh-oh.

4370
03:40:48,150 --> 03:40:48,350
Wait.

4371
03:40:50,030 --> 03:40:52,750
Okay, so tr.check.

4372
03:40:55,310 --> 03:40:56,230
Active...

4373
03:40:56,230 --> 03:40:56,510
Oh.

4374
03:40:56,830 --> 03:40:57,170
Wait.

4375
03:40:57,270 --> 03:40:57,870
Tr2.

4376
03:40:58,170 --> 03:40:59,930
Only has 18 power left.

4377
03:41:00,970 --> 03:41:01,890
Um...

4378
03:41:02,870 --> 03:41:04,290
What do I do?

4379
03:41:07,230 --> 03:41:07,690
Uh...

4380
03:41:07,690 --> 03:41:07,950
One.

4381
03:41:08,410 --> 03:41:09,090
Zero.

4382
03:41:09,870 --> 03:41:10,410
Five.

4383
03:41:11,870 --> 03:41:12,330
Oh!

4384
03:41:12,650 --> 03:41:13,250
I messed up.

4385
03:41:16,930 --> 03:41:17,850
Uh...

4386
03:41:17,850 --> 03:41:18,250
Five.

4387
03:41:19,510 --> 03:41:20,150
Two.

4388
03:41:21,090 --> 03:41:21,830
Five.

4389
03:41:23,330 --> 03:41:24,130
Five.

4390
03:41:24,130 --> 03:41:24,790
Uh...

4391
03:41:24,790 --> 03:41:25,150
Seven.

4392
03:41:26,390 --> 03:41:27,130
Five.

4393
03:41:28,390 --> 03:41:29,190
Uh...

4394
03:41:29,830 --> 03:41:30,290
Four.

4395
03:41:31,670 --> 03:41:32,470
Nine.

4396
03:41:32,830 --> 03:41:33,570
Uh...

4397
03:41:33,570 --> 03:41:35,070
I'm stressing!

4398
03:41:35,370 --> 03:41:36,190
I'm stressing!

4399
03:41:36,530 --> 03:41:37,810
I'm stressing a little bit.

4400
03:41:38,250 --> 03:41:40,310
Go out and turn TR2 on.

4401
03:41:40,630 --> 03:41:41,630
But it's on.

4402
03:41:41,810 --> 03:41:42,310
Technically.

4403
03:41:44,450 --> 03:41:45,990
You gotta reset it.

4404
03:41:46,110 --> 03:41:46,610
Oh, that's right.

4405
03:41:46,730 --> 03:41:47,430
The big button.

4406
03:41:48,550 --> 03:41:50,170
So one I could probably push.

4407
03:41:50,390 --> 03:41:51,570
And two I could push.

4408
03:41:52,790 --> 03:41:53,870
Three is okay.

4409
03:42:02,170 --> 03:42:02,890
Uh...

4410
03:42:02,890 --> 03:42:03,630
Uh...

4411
03:42:03,630 --> 03:42:04,550
Uh...

4412
03:42:07,130 --> 03:42:07,850
Uh...

4413
03:42:07,850 --> 03:42:08,110
Twelve.

4414
03:42:09,310 --> 03:42:09,910
Eight.

4415
03:42:11,390 --> 03:42:12,110
Three.

4416
03:42:13,270 --> 03:42:13,970
Six.

4417
03:42:13,970 --> 03:42:14,010
Six.

4418
03:42:14,670 --> 03:42:15,290
Two.

4419
03:42:16,270 --> 03:42:16,970
Uh...

4420
03:42:16,970 --> 03:42:17,230
Two.

4421
03:42:18,350 --> 03:42:18,730
Nine.

4422
03:42:20,510 --> 03:42:21,130
Two.

4423
03:42:24,550 --> 03:42:25,410
Oh my gosh.

4424
03:42:25,410 --> 03:42:26,790
There's so many things to check in this game.

4425
03:42:27,490 --> 03:42:28,110
Three.

4426
03:42:29,630 --> 03:42:30,250
Six.

4427
03:42:31,730 --> 03:42:32,350
Uh...

4428
03:42:32,350 --> 03:42:32,590
Three.

4429
03:42:34,730 --> 03:42:35,350
Five.

4430
03:42:40,780 --> 03:42:41,480
Seven.

4431
03:42:41,480 --> 03:42:41,580
Seven.

4432
03:42:59,270 --> 03:42:59,990
Whew!

4433
03:43:03,010 --> 03:43:03,910
It's 6 AM.

4434
03:43:04,330 --> 03:43:05,570
Which means...

4435
03:43:05,570 --> 03:43:07,330
The sun is coming up soon.

4436
03:43:07,450 --> 03:43:08,330
We will go outside.

4437
03:43:10,870 --> 03:43:12,850
Where are the transformers?

4438
03:43:17,290 --> 03:43:18,730
Where are they?

4439
03:43:22,590 --> 03:43:24,710
SV target TR2 will show you.

4440
03:43:24,830 --> 03:43:25,010
Okay.

4441
03:43:25,590 --> 03:43:26,570
This is...

4442
03:43:26,570 --> 03:43:28,110
The voice of the void speaking.

4443
03:43:30,010 --> 03:43:30,570
Here...

4444
03:43:30,570 --> 03:43:30,730
Wait.

4445
03:43:30,990 --> 03:43:31,090
What?

4446
03:43:31,290 --> 03:43:31,950
Drinking water?

4447
03:43:32,070 --> 03:43:33,270
Yes, I'm drinking water.

4448
03:43:33,570 --> 03:43:34,350
Is that what you asked?

4449
03:43:35,270 --> 03:43:35,930
Hold on.

4450
03:43:36,230 --> 03:43:37,290
Actually, I'm gonna drink water.

4451
03:43:42,720 --> 03:43:43,640
What am I doing?

4452
03:43:43,840 --> 03:43:44,340
SV.

4453
03:43:45,160 --> 03:43:47,260
You cannot save in mid-air.

4454
03:43:51,800 --> 03:43:52,360
What?

4455
03:44:01,900 --> 03:44:03,020
Target TR...

4456
03:44:03,020 --> 03:44:03,780
Two.

4457
03:44:04,740 --> 03:44:05,740
Server found.

4458
03:44:05,740 --> 03:44:06,520
Okay.

4459
03:44:08,780 --> 03:44:09,300
Uh...

4460
03:44:11,050 --> 03:44:12,050
Okay.

4461
03:44:12,310 --> 03:44:13,930
Now the compass points to it.

4462
03:44:14,190 --> 03:44:14,430
Okay.

4463
03:44:21,620 --> 03:44:22,140
Why...

4464
03:44:22,140 --> 03:44:23,340
I wasn't in mid-air.

4465
03:44:23,520 --> 03:44:24,100
Was I?

4466
03:44:25,220 --> 03:44:25,740
Alright.

4467
03:44:25,960 --> 03:44:26,660
It's 6 AM.

4468
03:44:26,660 --> 03:44:27,900
I think we can go...

4469
03:44:27,900 --> 03:44:28,620
To it.

4470
03:44:28,680 --> 03:44:30,260
So if I equip the compass...

4471
03:44:31,720 --> 03:44:32,240
Wait.

4472
03:44:32,420 --> 03:44:32,940
What compass?

4473
03:44:34,060 --> 03:44:35,260
The one at the bottom?

4474
03:44:36,820 --> 03:44:38,060
What's it pointed to?

4475
03:44:41,870 --> 03:44:43,990
Which way is pointing to it?

4476
03:44:44,290 --> 03:44:44,730
The red?

4477
03:44:46,850 --> 03:44:48,370
Red arrow points.

4478
03:44:48,810 --> 03:44:49,070
Okay.

4479
03:44:49,170 --> 03:44:49,610
Thank you.

4480
03:44:51,850 --> 03:44:54,450
Think we should go before the power goes out.

4481
03:44:54,630 --> 03:44:54,930
Maybe.

4482
03:44:59,360 --> 03:45:00,000
Okay.

4483
03:45:01,340 --> 03:45:01,980
Oh.

4484
03:45:19,370 --> 03:45:20,010
To...

4485
03:45:20,010 --> 03:45:20,950
That way.

4486
03:45:24,890 --> 03:45:25,450
Ooh.

4487
03:45:25,690 --> 03:45:26,210
It's dark out.

4488
03:45:31,270 --> 03:45:31,830
Okay.

4489
03:45:35,150 --> 03:45:35,710
Oh.

4490
03:45:35,810 --> 03:45:37,370
But I locked the garage door.

4491
03:45:37,550 --> 03:45:37,990
It's fine.

4492
03:45:43,870 --> 03:45:44,430
Okay.

4493
03:45:47,490 --> 03:45:48,710
The sun's coming up.

4494
03:45:48,790 --> 03:45:49,150
We're fine.

4495
03:45:51,890 --> 03:45:52,470
I think.

4496
03:45:54,830 --> 03:45:55,930
I'm off the path.

4497
03:45:56,990 --> 03:45:58,350
I'm following the arrow.

4498
03:45:58,790 --> 03:45:59,910
Maybe I do need a flashlight.

4499
03:46:01,970 --> 03:46:03,170
50 move turn.

4500
03:46:03,450 --> 03:46:04,170
Hey, you try.

4501
03:46:04,930 --> 03:46:06,290
This game is not...

4502
03:46:10,910 --> 03:46:11,570
Oh my god.

4503
03:46:11,810 --> 03:46:12,430
You try.

4504
03:46:18,210 --> 03:46:18,810
I...

4505
03:46:18,810 --> 03:46:19,050
I...

4506
03:46:19,050 --> 03:46:21,690
Was doing the best that the game is...

4507
03:46:21,690 --> 03:46:23,610
Is helping me out with.

4508
03:46:23,770 --> 03:46:24,010
Okay.

4509
03:46:25,170 --> 03:46:26,930
Why is everything so far away?

4510
03:46:30,850 --> 03:46:32,250
Wait, what's that glowy?

4511
03:46:33,110 --> 03:46:34,310
Is that just the sun?

4512
03:46:34,770 --> 03:46:35,750
Or a light?

4513
03:46:36,090 --> 03:46:36,310
Maybe.

4514
03:46:37,310 --> 03:46:37,930
Lamp post.

4515
03:46:42,970 --> 03:46:44,770
You can press shift or boost.

4516
03:46:47,750 --> 03:46:48,450
Oh wait.

4517
03:46:48,530 --> 03:46:50,990
I forgot to check if this needed fuel or not.

4518
03:46:52,110 --> 03:46:52,650
Um.

4519
03:46:52,690 --> 03:46:53,410
I sure hope not.

4520
03:47:00,270 --> 03:47:00,870
Okay.

4521
03:47:06,390 --> 03:47:06,910
The...

4522
03:47:06,910 --> 03:47:08,350
It's a little jumpy.

4523
03:47:11,430 --> 03:47:12,310
Oh my gosh.

4524
03:47:12,310 --> 03:47:13,010
We made it.

4525
03:47:13,790 --> 03:47:15,590
There's trash here too?

4526
03:47:16,290 --> 03:47:17,570
I can't escape.

4527
03:47:20,870 --> 03:47:21,470
Wow.

4528
03:47:25,070 --> 03:47:26,030
Explosive barrel.

4529
03:47:27,150 --> 03:47:27,970
That's exciting.

4530
03:47:29,410 --> 03:47:30,350
Regular barrel.

4531
03:47:30,590 --> 03:47:31,550
What do I use that for?

4532
03:47:31,730 --> 03:47:32,410
Oh, just storage?

4533
03:47:41,750 --> 03:47:42,770
Oh, I'm hungry.

4534
03:47:54,290 --> 03:47:54,770
Oh.

4535
03:47:54,970 --> 03:47:56,010
That's not what I meant to hold.

4536
03:47:57,490 --> 03:47:57,970
Nope.

4537
03:47:58,410 --> 03:47:58,550
Uh.

4538
03:48:00,470 --> 03:48:01,310
Oh my gosh.

4539
03:48:01,450 --> 03:48:02,650
I am so bad at...

4540
03:48:02,650 --> 03:48:03,790
Figuring out...

4541
03:48:03,790 --> 03:48:04,410
How to do this.

4542
03:48:10,890 --> 03:48:11,410
No.

4543
03:48:11,550 --> 03:48:11,730
No.

4544
03:48:11,830 --> 03:48:12,030
Trip, trip.

4545
03:48:15,530 --> 03:48:16,050
Alright.

4546
03:48:22,450 --> 03:48:23,370
Um, oh.

4547
03:48:23,570 --> 03:48:23,870
Oh.

4548
03:48:24,110 --> 03:48:25,210
Let's go home.

4549
03:48:27,450 --> 03:48:28,190
Oh god.

4550
03:48:29,430 --> 03:48:30,310
You guys.

4551
03:48:31,750 --> 03:48:32,910
I don't know how to turn.

4552
03:48:33,590 --> 03:48:34,390
Oh my god.

4553
03:48:34,690 --> 03:48:35,190
Oh my god.

4554
03:48:35,490 --> 03:48:35,870
Okay.

4555
03:48:36,050 --> 03:48:36,430
We're fine.

4556
03:48:36,430 --> 03:48:37,770
Alright, don't crash, don't crash.

4557
03:48:38,190 --> 03:48:40,570
Okay, yeah, all good.

4558
03:48:44,530 --> 03:48:45,310
I'm cruising.

4559
03:48:46,590 --> 03:48:47,690
Cruising downhill.

4560
03:48:49,990 --> 03:48:51,930
Brace for impacts, no, no.

4561
03:48:53,570 --> 03:48:54,790
Oh, never mind.

4562
03:48:58,030 --> 03:49:01,690
They put trees in the pathway for some reason.

4563
03:49:10,870 --> 03:49:12,810
Why would they do that now?

4564
03:49:15,910 --> 03:49:16,830
Look at that!

4565
03:49:21,030 --> 03:49:23,170
Is this making my flashlight go down?

4566
03:49:23,330 --> 03:49:24,090
I can't tell, actually.

4567
03:49:25,870 --> 03:49:27,930
Uh, I think I'd go straight.

4568
03:49:34,590 --> 03:49:36,050
Home sweet home!

4569
03:49:40,810 --> 03:49:41,330
Ah!

4570
03:49:42,070 --> 03:49:42,850
Whoa, whoa.

4571
03:49:44,590 --> 03:49:46,470
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

4572
03:49:46,470 --> 03:49:47,030
Ah, oh.

4573
03:49:47,630 --> 03:49:48,030
Oh.

4574
03:49:53,680 --> 03:49:54,180
Um.

4575
03:49:56,980 --> 03:49:58,460
What did I run into?

4576
03:49:59,780 --> 03:50:01,420
Oh, this may be...

4577
03:50:01,760 --> 03:50:02,400
Oopsie!

4578
03:50:05,680 --> 03:50:06,820
Nailed it, huh?

4579
03:50:08,000 --> 03:50:09,260
Let's see.

4580
03:50:13,730 --> 03:50:14,230
Alright.

4581
03:50:15,790 --> 03:50:17,330
We made it home.

4582
03:50:18,870 --> 03:50:20,150
Let's, um...

4583
03:50:20,150 --> 03:50:21,150
Go through the front door.

4584
03:50:24,070 --> 03:50:24,710
Yeah?

4585
03:50:28,970 --> 03:50:31,170
You can pick up the ATV if it gets stuck.

4586
03:50:32,050 --> 03:50:32,690
True!

4587
03:50:34,770 --> 03:50:36,870
Alright, I'm gonna try and send these...

4588
03:50:37,330 --> 03:50:38,470
Via drone.

4589
03:50:41,930 --> 03:50:42,910
Oh my gosh.

4590
03:50:43,130 --> 03:50:43,590
My...

4591
03:50:44,210 --> 03:50:47,610
My window was so clean, I thought it was a TV screen.

4592
03:50:50,590 --> 03:50:51,350
Uh-oh.

4593
03:50:52,730 --> 03:50:53,490
Two signals.

4594
03:50:53,790 --> 03:50:54,670
Okay, we got this.

4595
03:50:55,010 --> 03:50:55,770
We got this.

4596
03:50:56,410 --> 03:50:57,770
Cannot determine location.

4597
03:51:03,370 --> 03:51:04,470
Wait, what do you mean?

4598
03:51:04,730 --> 03:51:07,110
We cannot triangulate your location, Dr. Kel.

4599
03:51:07,290 --> 03:51:09,490
Please check that all the systems are working properly.

4600
03:51:09,850 --> 03:51:11,430
Servers, consoles, radio tower.

4601
03:51:11,770 --> 03:51:13,410
The drone will be sent out...

4602
03:51:13,410 --> 03:51:14,910
Oh no, we didn't get any food!

4603
03:51:18,050 --> 03:51:20,410
Radio tower needs to be fixed.

4604
03:51:24,360 --> 03:51:25,960
Climb the radio tower?

4605
03:51:25,960 --> 03:51:26,780
Where is that?

4606
03:51:26,780 --> 03:51:27,020
What?

4607
03:51:28,460 --> 03:51:30,200
Wait, so I can't take this?

4608
03:51:31,400 --> 03:51:31,880
And...

4609
03:51:38,090 --> 03:51:39,270
Oh, it's right out front?

4610
03:51:39,590 --> 03:51:40,370
Oh, okay, easy.

4611
03:51:58,870 --> 03:51:59,790
What was...

4612
03:51:59,790 --> 03:52:01,010
This one's 1111?

4613
03:52:02,830 --> 03:52:05,530
Oh, I was thinking of the password for over there.

4614
03:52:10,210 --> 03:52:11,750
For the admin room, yeah.

4615
03:52:15,030 --> 03:52:17,010
Wait, so they won't be able to come now?

4616
03:52:17,010 --> 03:52:17,450
What?

4617
03:52:21,530 --> 03:52:22,850
Status offline.

4618
03:52:23,070 --> 03:52:23,230
Yeah.

4619
03:52:23,530 --> 03:52:24,570
Yeah, we can't.

4620
03:52:25,050 --> 03:52:25,890
Okay.

4621
03:52:26,610 --> 03:52:27,450
Alright, radio time.

4622
03:52:27,870 --> 03:52:28,510
Oh!

4623
03:52:45,020 --> 03:52:46,120
Oh no!

4624
03:53:03,630 --> 03:53:08,190
With darkness and silence through the night.

4625
03:53:10,090 --> 03:53:11,730
What a thrill.

4626
03:53:13,630 --> 03:53:14,690
Oh my gosh.

4627
03:53:15,290 --> 03:53:17,010
That sound like a skelly man.

4628
03:53:17,010 --> 03:53:17,670
Hahaha.

4629
03:53:19,650 --> 03:53:20,790
What's that mean?

4630
03:53:21,370 --> 03:53:21,850
Beep, beep.

4631
03:53:22,090 --> 03:53:22,490
Bop, beep.

4632
03:53:25,950 --> 03:53:27,210
We good now?

4633
03:53:27,510 --> 03:53:29,350
There's even trash up here.

4634
03:53:32,450 --> 03:53:33,390
That's it?

4635
03:53:34,510 --> 03:53:35,250
Fixed?

4636
03:53:37,050 --> 03:53:38,310
Don't look down.

4637
03:53:39,570 --> 03:53:40,690
Free food.

4638
03:53:40,690 --> 03:53:40,910
Food.

4639
03:53:45,830 --> 03:53:48,350
I'm not trying to save mid-air.

4640
03:53:51,830 --> 03:53:52,570
Hot dog.

4641
03:53:56,200 --> 03:53:57,740
That's a lot of food.

4642
03:53:57,940 --> 03:53:58,740
Aw, empty.

4643
03:53:59,760 --> 03:54:00,060
Okay.

4644
03:54:06,030 --> 03:54:06,350
See?

4645
03:54:06,490 --> 03:54:07,550
They go down faster.

4646
03:54:08,410 --> 03:54:09,890
I know what you're trying to make me do.

4647
03:54:10,110 --> 03:54:11,330
You're trying to make me collapse.

4648
03:54:11,830 --> 03:54:14,390
You're trying to make me ragdoll and then fall to my death.

4649
03:54:14,690 --> 03:54:15,030
Huh?

4650
03:54:18,530 --> 03:54:19,910
I know your games.

4651
03:54:33,230 --> 03:54:34,490
I think I hear the drone.

4652
03:54:38,980 --> 03:54:39,680
My food.

4653
03:54:42,240 --> 03:54:42,780
Uh oh.

4654
03:54:43,020 --> 03:54:43,200
Wait.

4655
03:54:43,420 --> 03:54:43,960
Wait, wait, wait.

4656
03:54:44,160 --> 03:54:44,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4657
03:54:45,260 --> 03:54:45,540
Uh.

4658
03:54:46,360 --> 03:54:46,520
Uh.

4659
03:54:47,320 --> 03:54:47,820
There you go.

4660
03:54:49,060 --> 03:54:49,780
There you go.

4661
03:54:54,230 --> 03:54:55,310
Wow, this is big.

4662
03:54:57,810 --> 03:54:59,970
All that for one drive and one MRE?

4663
03:55:01,050 --> 03:55:02,370
What do I do with the rest of this?

4664
03:55:09,750 --> 03:55:10,430
Okay.

4665
03:55:10,890 --> 03:55:11,930
Oh my god.

4666
03:55:12,130 --> 03:55:12,350
Heavy.

4667
03:55:13,450 --> 03:55:14,510
Oh, leave it?

4668
03:55:14,710 --> 03:55:15,030
Oh.

4669
03:55:16,110 --> 03:55:16,910
Ah, whatever.

4670
03:55:17,390 --> 03:55:17,910
Free box.

4671
03:55:20,110 --> 03:55:21,690
Play free box.

4672
03:55:26,350 --> 03:55:27,230
No, no.

4673
03:55:27,970 --> 03:55:29,110
Call for drone.

4674
03:55:32,370 --> 03:55:33,150
How do I use it?

4675
03:55:34,650 --> 03:55:36,330
Oh, you gotta wait for it to return.

4676
03:55:36,610 --> 03:55:36,890
Okay.

4677
03:55:37,950 --> 03:55:38,950
La la la.

4678
03:55:39,770 --> 03:55:40,970
La la la la.

4679
03:55:42,010 --> 03:55:44,270
I just noticed the bars on the window.

4680
03:55:51,390 --> 03:55:52,270
Our box!

4681
03:55:53,110 --> 03:55:53,990
It disappeared.

4682
03:55:59,730 --> 03:56:01,130
How far is he going?

4683
03:56:01,250 --> 03:56:02,390
And then we're gonna have to wait for him to come...

4684
03:56:02,990 --> 03:56:03,430
There.

4685
03:56:03,430 --> 03:56:04,830
That's how far he goes.

4686
03:56:06,350 --> 03:56:08,030
No, come all the way back.

4687
03:56:18,470 --> 03:56:20,770
Yeah, fire watch was this difficult.

4688
03:56:21,090 --> 03:56:23,010
I would not want to do it.

4689
03:56:23,410 --> 03:56:26,030
It seems that you just like record weather and...

4690
03:56:27,750 --> 03:56:28,470
You know.

4691
03:56:29,590 --> 03:56:31,790
How far are you in cleaning up the place?

4692
03:56:31,790 --> 03:56:31,810
Yes.

4693
03:56:32,110 --> 03:56:32,570
I...

4694
03:56:32,570 --> 03:56:34,810
Have made some trash piles.

4695
03:56:36,030 --> 03:56:37,790
And I cleaned my window...

4696
03:56:38,550 --> 03:56:39,190
Halfway.

4697
03:56:46,810 --> 03:56:48,430
We've done a lot of work.

4698
03:56:51,490 --> 03:56:53,670
I'll continue making trash piles.

4699
03:56:53,870 --> 03:56:54,530
Oh my gosh, wait.

4700
03:56:55,250 --> 03:56:56,490
What if instead of...

4701
03:56:56,490 --> 03:56:56,690
Okay.

4702
03:56:56,690 --> 03:56:56,750
Okay.

4703
03:56:57,130 --> 03:56:59,410
I could create a wall with the trash.

4704
03:57:00,270 --> 03:57:01,910
I don't ever have to shut the door.

4705
03:57:06,300 --> 03:57:07,260
I hear him.

4706
03:57:08,920 --> 03:57:09,960
The little drone.

4707
03:57:09,960 --> 03:57:10,700
Where is he?

4708
03:57:12,060 --> 03:57:13,060
I hear him.

4709
03:57:15,240 --> 03:57:16,140
Where is he?

4710
03:57:16,820 --> 03:57:17,700
Oh, there he is!

4711
03:57:23,910 --> 03:57:25,430
Whoa, that's a big drone.

4712
03:57:37,680 --> 03:57:38,840
Guys, it's starting to rain.

4713
03:57:39,180 --> 03:57:39,820
I'm scared.

4714
03:58:00,150 --> 03:58:01,770
I'm scared because...

4715
03:58:01,770 --> 03:58:04,210
That's when the fog man comes, no?

4716
03:58:11,140 --> 03:58:11,660
Okay.

4717
03:58:11,900 --> 03:58:12,520
I locked that.

4718
03:58:13,060 --> 03:58:13,280
Okay.

4719
03:58:16,390 --> 03:58:17,490
It's 11am.

4720
03:58:20,370 --> 03:58:22,210
You can just hit the red button to lock.

4721
03:58:22,330 --> 03:58:22,730
Oh, okay.

4722
03:58:23,510 --> 03:58:24,770
That seems easier.

4723
03:58:33,430 --> 03:58:35,170
What's T2 at?

4724
03:58:37,030 --> 03:58:38,790
I don't know, we should check.

4725
03:58:40,630 --> 03:58:42,310
I'll fix this first!

4726
03:58:43,090 --> 03:58:43,450
Five!

4727
03:58:45,910 --> 03:58:46,830
Uh...

4728
03:58:47,490 --> 03:58:48,030
Two!

4729
03:58:49,690 --> 03:58:50,610
Eight!

4730
03:58:51,390 --> 03:58:52,150
Five!

4731
03:58:52,430 --> 03:58:54,170
It tripped me up, okay?

4732
03:58:56,410 --> 03:58:56,870
Six!

4733
03:58:57,710 --> 03:58:58,190
One!

4734
03:59:01,570 --> 03:59:04,010
All right, all good, all good, all good.

4735
03:59:04,370 --> 03:59:05,150
All good.

4736
03:59:05,330 --> 03:59:06,890
I have barely done my job at all.

4737
03:59:07,650 --> 03:59:08,870
Wait, okay, so...

4738
03:59:08,870 --> 03:59:09,710
TR dot check.

4739
03:59:13,250 --> 03:59:13,530
47.

4740
03:59:14,470 --> 03:59:15,510
It's not great.

4741
03:59:19,170 --> 03:59:20,290
SB target...

4742
03:59:21,010 --> 03:59:21,570
TR...

4743
03:59:21,570 --> 03:59:22,350
What?

4744
03:59:23,090 --> 03:59:23,650
Okay.

4745
03:59:32,570 --> 03:59:34,410
I guess it's just rainy?

4746
03:59:39,230 --> 03:59:41,390
It's 11am, we could go.

4747
03:59:49,490 --> 03:59:50,090
Uh...

4748
04:00:01,670 --> 04:00:03,350
Yeah, what's the worst that could happen?

4749
04:00:06,290 --> 04:00:07,430
Let's be brave.

4750
04:00:12,790 --> 04:00:16,190
As you told, welcome to membership, thank you!

4751
04:00:23,700 --> 04:00:24,300
Beep!

4752
04:00:25,840 --> 04:00:27,360
Oh wait, it's so sunny!

4753
04:00:28,200 --> 04:00:29,180
Ha ha ha ha!

4754
04:00:29,720 --> 04:00:30,900
I got bamboozled.

4755
04:00:33,480 --> 04:00:34,980
Uh, uh, uh...

4756
04:00:34,980 --> 04:00:38,320
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh...

4757
04:00:40,160 --> 04:00:40,760
Um...

4758
04:00:41,340 --> 04:00:41,760
Uh oh.

4759
04:00:45,800 --> 04:00:46,400
Um...

4760
04:00:46,400 --> 04:00:48,180
Let's grab you.

4761
04:00:48,920 --> 04:00:50,360
Oh wow, he's so light.

4762
04:00:50,520 --> 04:00:50,660
Okay.

4763
04:00:55,890 --> 04:00:56,930
Uh, this way.

4764
04:01:01,990 --> 04:01:02,730
Oops.

4765
04:01:10,200 --> 04:01:12,760
Watch out for rocks and trees.

4766
04:01:13,640 --> 04:01:15,080
In the forest.

4767
04:01:17,080 --> 04:01:18,380
Wait, what is this?

4768
04:01:21,640 --> 04:01:23,040
Is this another one?

4769
04:01:27,840 --> 04:01:29,160
Which one is this?

4770
04:01:30,120 --> 04:01:31,440
Is this the first one?

4771
04:01:31,620 --> 04:01:32,980
It's so close to home!

4772
04:01:34,020 --> 04:01:35,520
It's the substation.

4773
04:01:36,980 --> 04:01:37,540
Oh...

4774
04:01:37,960 --> 04:01:38,920
I see, I see.

4775
04:01:43,660 --> 04:01:44,220
Heya!

4776
04:01:48,070 --> 04:01:49,510
Maybe we'll take this road.

4777
04:01:52,610 --> 04:01:54,850
Oh, this is the first road I took!

4778
04:01:55,410 --> 04:01:56,870
When looking for the...

4779
04:01:57,030 --> 04:01:57,550
What the?

4780
04:02:04,230 --> 04:02:05,750
This is...

4781
04:02:05,750 --> 04:02:07,410
Not here before?

4782
04:02:14,650 --> 04:02:15,410
Huh.

4783
04:02:19,610 --> 04:02:21,590
Happens from time to time.

4784
04:02:21,930 --> 04:02:22,370
Oh, okay.

4785
04:02:23,850 --> 04:02:24,390
Yeah.

4786
04:02:25,270 --> 04:02:25,690
Uh...

4787
04:02:25,690 --> 04:02:26,510
Oh, wait.

4788
04:02:26,690 --> 04:02:26,970
Uh oh.

4789
04:02:27,570 --> 04:02:28,590
Oh no, dead end!

4790
04:02:30,710 --> 04:02:31,130
Ah...

4791
04:02:36,230 --> 04:02:36,650
Quantum.

4792
04:02:42,500 --> 04:02:43,380
It's still there.

4793
04:02:45,360 --> 04:02:46,020
Oh my god.

4794
04:02:46,200 --> 04:02:46,800
Wait, I'm gonna...

4795
04:02:46,800 --> 04:02:47,480
I'm gonna crash!

4796
04:02:47,920 --> 04:02:48,340
I'm not.

4797
04:02:48,660 --> 04:02:49,360
Haha, just kidding.

4798
04:02:54,710 --> 04:02:55,130
Uh...

4799
04:02:55,130 --> 04:02:56,010
Which way do I go?

4800
04:02:58,370 --> 04:02:59,770
Uh...

4801
04:02:59,770 --> 04:03:00,530
Uh...

4802
04:03:05,260 --> 04:03:06,660
Uh...

4803
04:03:07,280 --> 04:03:07,980
Bass?

4804
04:03:13,380 --> 04:03:14,360
What was that?

4805
04:03:15,220 --> 04:03:16,760
I didn't hit anything.

4806
04:03:17,200 --> 04:03:17,940
I don't think.

4807
04:03:21,500 --> 04:03:23,780
Okay, I'll try...

4808
04:03:23,780 --> 04:03:24,880
This way.

4809
04:03:25,720 --> 04:03:26,580
It's just...

4810
04:03:26,580 --> 04:03:29,860
I know I'm supposed to follow the red part, but it's all...

4811
04:03:29,860 --> 04:03:30,900
Rocky terrain.

4812
04:03:31,640 --> 04:03:32,500
You see?

4813
04:03:33,760 --> 04:03:35,600
When I try to follow it.

4814
04:03:36,120 --> 04:03:36,360
Okay.

4815
04:03:40,520 --> 04:03:41,340
Uh oh.

4816
04:03:44,260 --> 04:03:44,940
Um...

4817
04:03:51,350 --> 04:03:52,330
We're fine.

4818
04:03:55,850 --> 04:03:56,370
Again?

4819
04:03:56,370 --> 04:03:56,690
Oh!

4820
04:03:56,930 --> 04:03:57,190
Oh!

4821
04:03:57,430 --> 04:03:57,570
Oh!

4822
04:03:57,790 --> 04:03:57,930
Oh!

4823
04:04:01,180 --> 04:04:02,280
How did we live?

4824
04:04:04,240 --> 04:04:05,920
Wait, why is it trying to save?

4825
04:04:06,880 --> 04:04:07,720
Uh, the game...

4826
04:04:07,720 --> 04:04:09,020
Oh, I think it's just autosaving.

4827
04:04:12,440 --> 04:04:12,700
Oh!

4828
04:04:13,660 --> 04:04:14,520
Oh yeah!

4829
04:04:18,480 --> 04:04:20,420
Oh yeah, baby!

4830
04:04:25,480 --> 04:04:26,000
Nice.

4831
04:04:28,940 --> 04:04:30,360
Nice, nice, nice!

4832
04:04:31,620 --> 04:04:34,180
It's kind of unfair though that...

4833
04:04:35,100 --> 04:04:37,120
It's taking me so off the road.

4834
04:04:43,230 --> 04:04:44,470
I think I see it.

4835
04:04:46,790 --> 04:04:47,370
Yes!

4836
04:04:51,610 --> 04:04:53,130
We'll take the path back.

4837
04:04:53,430 --> 04:04:54,450
See where it...

4838
04:04:54,450 --> 04:04:54,630
Which...

4839
04:04:54,630 --> 04:04:57,050
Which way we were supposed to go.

4840
04:04:58,830 --> 04:05:00,970
Victor Papa.

4841
04:05:01,710 --> 04:05:04,050
Oh, here's...

4842
04:05:10,020 --> 04:05:12,600
Oh, here's...

4843
04:05:12,600 --> 04:05:13,340
Oh, it's still at 41.

4844
04:05:18,780 --> 04:05:19,860
Toolbox.

4845
04:05:21,240 --> 04:05:22,120
MRE.

4846
04:05:23,060 --> 04:05:24,080
Take that.

4847
04:05:25,480 --> 04:05:26,960
Take all that.

4848
04:05:35,590 --> 04:05:37,270
This plant has worked.

4849
04:05:37,730 --> 04:05:38,390
Smiley days.

4850
04:05:43,030 --> 04:05:44,910
Refill your...

4851
04:05:47,240 --> 04:05:49,660
How do I fill it up?

4852
04:05:50,860 --> 04:05:51,980
My AT...

4853
04:05:51,980 --> 04:05:52,100
Oh.

4854
04:05:52,540 --> 04:05:52,880
Oops.

4855
04:05:53,480 --> 04:05:53,600
Oh.

4856
04:05:57,630 --> 04:05:58,570
Smiley.

4857
04:06:00,260 --> 04:06:00,730
Ooh!

4858
04:06:05,800 --> 04:06:07,550
Just put the canteen on top of it.

4859
04:06:11,870 --> 04:06:12,810
Cool!

4860
04:06:17,450 --> 04:06:19,870
Hold the gas can and click ATV.

4861
04:06:21,110 --> 04:06:22,990
Oh, it's that little hole in the front, huh?

4862
04:06:25,690 --> 04:06:26,170
Oh.

4863
04:06:27,270 --> 04:06:28,670
Don't cause any sparks.

4864
04:06:40,910 --> 04:06:41,910
We'll get it someday.

4865
04:06:42,590 --> 04:06:43,610
I hurt...

4866
04:06:43,610 --> 04:06:44,110
I hurt...

4867
04:06:44,110 --> 04:06:44,710
I hurt it a little bit.

4868
04:06:44,890 --> 04:06:45,650
Unless it's empty.

4869
04:06:56,550 --> 04:06:57,610
Let's try another.

4870
04:07:05,750 --> 04:07:06,350
Alright.

4871
04:07:07,630 --> 04:07:09,850
Maybe this is how the trash accumulated.

4872
04:07:13,610 --> 04:07:14,210
Careful.

4873
04:07:17,210 --> 04:07:17,810
Nice!

4874
04:07:18,730 --> 04:07:20,930
How do I know how full it is though?

4875
04:07:21,810 --> 04:07:23,150
I don't see anything.

4876
04:07:25,330 --> 04:07:27,070
Is it the 77?

4877
04:07:30,840 --> 04:07:32,860
You can look at the cap.

4878
04:07:33,940 --> 04:07:34,440
Oh.

4879
04:07:37,840 --> 04:07:39,340
Look at the handlebars.

4880
04:07:40,860 --> 04:07:41,540
Oh!

4881
04:07:43,060 --> 04:07:43,840
I see.

4882
04:07:47,080 --> 04:07:48,860
Let's go home.

4883
04:07:49,740 --> 04:07:50,240
Oops.

4884
04:07:56,240 --> 04:07:57,520
Everything's fine.

4885
04:08:03,580 --> 04:08:04,800
We're just gliding.

4886
04:08:09,760 --> 04:08:10,940
We're just...

4887
04:08:10,940 --> 04:08:12,700
Sliding along.

4888
04:08:13,860 --> 04:08:15,500
Gliding along.

4889
04:08:17,860 --> 04:08:19,200
I don't know what that said.

4890
04:08:20,240 --> 04:08:21,520
How do I get home?

4891
04:08:23,360 --> 04:08:23,920
Um.

4892
04:08:25,680 --> 04:08:26,800
Wait.

4893
04:08:27,380 --> 04:08:29,720
How do I get home?

4894
04:08:43,280 --> 04:08:44,820
I can just...

4895
04:08:46,800 --> 04:08:47,400
Yeah.

4896
04:08:47,840 --> 04:08:49,680
I think I'm following the right way.

4897
04:08:53,180 --> 04:08:53,780
Oh.

4898
04:08:53,960 --> 04:08:54,260
Oh.

4899
04:08:54,580 --> 04:08:54,720
Oh.

4900
04:08:54,720 --> 04:08:54,800
Oh.

4901
04:08:54,980 --> 04:08:55,060
Oh.

4902
04:08:55,060 --> 04:08:55,460
Oh.

4903
04:08:55,460 --> 04:08:56,020
I'm a good driver.

4904
04:08:56,740 --> 04:08:57,800
Just hold on.

4905
04:08:58,560 --> 04:08:58,960
Oh.

4906
04:08:59,180 --> 04:08:59,580
Yeah, yeah.

4907
04:08:59,720 --> 04:09:00,260
We're almost here.

4908
04:09:01,220 --> 04:09:02,840
Cause that's the mysterious pole.

4909
04:09:13,400 --> 04:09:14,200
Okay, guys.

4910
04:09:14,260 --> 04:09:15,660
I wanna see a creature.

4911
04:09:17,440 --> 04:09:18,660
I'm gonna stay up.

4912
04:09:18,900 --> 04:09:20,200
Cause I'm also getting tired.

4913
04:09:20,380 --> 04:09:22,200
My voice is starting to get a little...

4914
04:09:24,100 --> 04:09:26,540
I don't even know how long I've been streaming for.

4915
04:09:29,020 --> 04:09:30,340
I wanna see a creature.

4916
04:09:32,020 --> 04:09:33,660
So we're gonna do our best.

4917
04:09:33,860 --> 04:09:35,480
To see a dang creature.

4918
04:09:37,300 --> 04:09:38,300
Four hours?

4919
04:09:38,680 --> 04:09:39,400
Oh wow.

4920
04:09:40,460 --> 04:09:42,460
I said that today might be a short stream.

4921
04:09:42,820 --> 04:09:43,720
But I'm having fun.

4922
04:09:44,040 --> 04:09:44,440
So...

4923
04:09:44,440 --> 04:09:46,300
I can activate this camera.

4924
04:09:50,280 --> 04:09:51,320
How do I see it?

4925
04:09:52,100 --> 04:09:54,020
Wait, where do I go to see the camera?

4926
04:10:06,850 --> 04:10:08,790
Got your package, Dr. Kel.

4927
04:10:08,910 --> 04:10:10,530
But the hash codes are not complete.

4928
04:10:10,670 --> 04:10:11,690
Please complete the task.

4929
04:10:12,830 --> 04:10:14,910
I forgot to do the paper.

4930
04:10:15,250 --> 04:10:15,690
I'd rather not.

4931
04:10:15,790 --> 04:10:16,970
Thank you so much for the ticket, dude.

4932
04:10:19,310 --> 04:10:20,630
Please redo the full rep...

4933
04:10:20,630 --> 04:10:20,910
Oh!

4934
04:10:21,290 --> 04:10:22,010
Oh, wait.

4935
04:10:22,230 --> 04:10:23,450
No, I forgot about that.

4936
04:10:24,470 --> 04:10:26,890
10 points have been successfully...

4937
04:10:26,890 --> 04:10:29,590
Or has been sent to your account balance.

4938
04:10:32,510 --> 04:10:35,970
These are okay, but our systems can't recognize anything useful.

4939
04:10:36,190 --> 04:10:38,330
Try to find something more interesting than that.

4940
04:10:38,450 --> 04:10:39,230
What are you talking about?

4941
04:10:43,490 --> 04:10:44,930
What is she talking about?

4942
04:10:49,170 --> 04:10:50,850
Camera is in the top of PC?

4943
04:10:53,930 --> 04:10:55,850
Oh yeah, I haven't checked the radar in a bit.

4944
04:10:56,310 --> 04:10:57,010
Oh, we're at four?

4945
04:11:00,430 --> 04:11:01,650
What is that up there?

4946
04:11:03,690 --> 04:11:05,070
I want to go check.

4947
04:11:07,890 --> 04:11:10,490
I want to go see...

4948
04:11:14,330 --> 04:11:15,790
My download stopped.

4949
04:11:16,430 --> 04:11:17,050
I don't think...

4950
04:11:17,870 --> 04:11:18,910
I wasn't...

4951
04:11:18,910 --> 04:11:19,890
I haven't done this yet.

4952
04:11:20,890 --> 04:11:21,410
For...

4953
04:11:21,410 --> 04:11:23,290
Whatever we found, actually.

4954
04:11:24,730 --> 04:11:26,670
So I guess I can do that right now.

4955
04:11:34,240 --> 04:11:35,220
Oh, okay, good.

4956
04:11:50,620 --> 04:11:51,980
Tab on the PC.

4957
04:11:52,180 --> 04:11:52,540
Tab on the PC.

4958
04:11:52,540 --> 04:11:53,060
Okay, thank you.

4959
04:11:55,960 --> 04:11:56,640
Oh.

4960
04:11:57,040 --> 04:11:57,640
Oh.

4961
04:11:57,920 --> 04:11:58,000
Oh.

4962
04:12:03,800 --> 04:12:04,480
Oh.

4963
04:12:04,680 --> 04:12:05,900
Oh, so close.

4964
04:12:07,160 --> 04:12:08,040
Oh, whoops.

4965
04:12:08,140 --> 04:12:08,380
My bad.

4966
04:12:10,240 --> 04:12:10,920
Camera.

4967
04:12:12,960 --> 04:12:14,160
It's not though.

4968
04:12:18,080 --> 04:12:22,700
Oh my god!

4969
04:12:23,100 --> 04:12:23,880
That's outside!

4970
04:12:23,880 --> 04:12:27,160
Remote keyboard control module is missing.

4971
04:12:28,980 --> 04:12:29,500
Whoa!

4972
04:12:30,160 --> 04:12:30,780
That's freaky.

4973
04:12:31,880 --> 04:12:32,420
Whoa!

4974
04:12:34,220 --> 04:12:35,900
That's so freaky!

4975
04:12:37,660 --> 04:12:39,680
That's a good angle, I'd say.

4976
04:12:43,150 --> 04:12:43,850
Like that.

4977
04:12:45,030 --> 04:12:48,750
Not even Solid Snake could crawl under that.

4978
04:12:56,760 --> 04:12:59,360
Yeah, it's analog horror, pretty much.

4979
04:13:00,560 --> 04:13:01,040
And...

4980
04:13:01,040 --> 04:13:01,740
Yeel.

4981
04:13:04,020 --> 04:13:04,660
Oh, wait.

4982
04:13:04,900 --> 04:13:06,140
It was actually so close already.

4983
04:13:06,480 --> 04:13:07,200
That's so funny.

4984
04:13:11,710 --> 04:13:12,190
How?

4985
04:13:17,570 --> 04:13:18,050
Perfect!

4986
04:13:20,130 --> 04:13:21,390
I'm a bit of a genius.

4987
04:13:21,970 --> 04:13:23,470
Alright, now our download is going.

4988
04:13:29,070 --> 04:13:30,850
What if he uses a chaff grenade?

4989
04:13:32,590 --> 04:13:33,030
Impossible.

4990
04:13:35,110 --> 04:13:35,550
Impossible.

4991
04:13:38,750 --> 04:13:40,150
You think that thing is still there?

4992
04:13:43,520 --> 04:13:44,820
I can't tell if it moved.

4993
04:13:45,020 --> 04:13:45,780
I don't think so.

4994
04:13:46,460 --> 04:13:47,320
I don't think so.

4995
04:13:48,300 --> 04:13:48,640
Oh.

4996
04:13:48,900 --> 04:13:50,180
But I wanna go see it.

4997
04:13:53,600 --> 04:13:54,240
Wait, it did?

4998
04:13:56,040 --> 04:13:57,220
It got closer?

4999
04:13:58,680 --> 04:13:59,880
No, it didn't.

5000
04:14:05,450 --> 04:14:06,690
No, it didn't.

5001
04:14:11,380 --> 04:14:12,520
You swear.

5002
04:14:12,520 --> 04:14:12,580
There.

5003
04:14:23,760 --> 04:14:24,210
Hold on.

5004
04:14:24,390 --> 04:14:25,270
I can zoom in, no?

5005
04:14:28,870 --> 04:14:30,790
Uh, how did I zoom in before?

5006
04:14:34,330 --> 04:14:34,990
Oh!

5007
04:14:35,890 --> 04:14:37,210
Wait, that...

5008
04:14:37,210 --> 04:14:38,070
Looks closer.

5009
04:14:39,350 --> 04:14:40,010
Oh.

5010
04:14:40,510 --> 04:14:41,870
That, um...

5011
04:14:41,870 --> 04:14:42,450
Wait.

5012
04:14:43,970 --> 04:14:44,630
Oh.

5013
04:14:44,630 --> 04:14:44,690
Oh.

5014
04:14:44,850 --> 04:14:46,210
I think that is moving.

5015
04:14:48,490 --> 04:14:49,170
Oh.

5016
04:14:50,530 --> 04:14:51,710
Oh, I think...

5017
04:14:51,710 --> 04:14:53,170
Whatever that is, it's approaching.

5018
04:14:53,690 --> 04:14:53,930
Oh.

5019
04:14:54,270 --> 04:14:55,190
It's a...

5020
04:14:55,190 --> 04:14:56,110
It's a moving.

5021
04:14:56,450 --> 04:14:56,930
Oh!

5022
04:14:57,870 --> 04:14:58,550
Um...

5023
04:14:58,550 --> 04:14:59,630
It's coming close!

5024
04:15:00,190 --> 04:15:00,870
Um...

5025
04:15:02,150 --> 04:15:02,830
Uh...

5026
04:15:03,770 --> 04:15:04,950
I think...

5027
04:15:04,950 --> 04:15:06,010
Maybe we should lock the door.

5028
04:15:43,550 --> 04:15:44,450
Wait a second.

5029
04:15:44,450 --> 04:15:45,150
I think it's...

5030
04:15:45,150 --> 04:15:46,150
Leaving now, no?

5031
04:15:49,890 --> 04:15:50,430
Oh.

5032
04:15:50,570 --> 04:15:51,030
I'm hungry.

5033
04:15:53,730 --> 04:15:55,050
Ah, it's not coming...

5034
04:15:55,050 --> 04:15:55,610
It's not...

5035
04:15:55,610 --> 04:15:56,510
Coming away any...

5036
04:15:56,510 --> 04:15:56,850
Or...

5037
04:15:56,850 --> 04:15:57,810
It's going away now.

5038
04:15:58,010 --> 04:15:58,890
It's not coming...

5039
04:15:58,890 --> 04:15:59,450
Towards...

5040
04:15:59,450 --> 04:16:00,050
It's like stopped.

5041
04:16:01,090 --> 04:16:03,270
Maybe you sensed that the doors were unlocked.

5042
04:16:04,570 --> 04:16:05,470
Aw, man.

5043
04:16:05,810 --> 04:16:06,070
No!

5044
04:16:08,290 --> 04:16:10,250
I was so ready to see it from the window.

5045
04:16:14,720 --> 04:16:15,960
Aw, man.

5046
04:16:18,280 --> 04:16:20,140
No, I wanted to see it.

5047
04:16:21,520 --> 04:16:22,660
I guess we could...

5048
04:16:22,660 --> 04:16:23,820
What if we went to its coordinates?

5049
04:16:29,740 --> 04:16:31,160
It's probably a deer.

5050
04:16:31,340 --> 04:16:32,840
There's animals in this game?

5051
04:16:40,030 --> 04:16:42,410
I still wonder why there's so many...

5052
04:16:42,410 --> 04:16:42,730
Five.

5053
04:16:42,730 --> 04:16:42,850
Five.

5054
04:16:44,750 --> 04:16:47,630
I still wonder why there's so many dots where I'm at.

5055
04:16:48,150 --> 04:16:48,910
It's kind of freaky.

5056
04:16:54,210 --> 04:16:55,570
I don't have to live.

5057
04:16:56,510 --> 04:16:57,770
If I die, I don't...

5058
04:16:57,770 --> 04:16:58,210
Oh, wait.

5059
04:16:59,750 --> 04:17:00,190
Oh.

5060
04:17:00,370 --> 04:17:01,390
Oh, it totally moved.

5061
04:17:01,630 --> 04:17:02,470
It's getting closer.

5062
04:17:03,810 --> 04:17:06,210
One is you, one is the tower, one is the ATV.

5063
04:17:07,150 --> 04:17:08,030
Ohhhhh.

5064
04:17:09,790 --> 04:17:11,490
Oh, it's getting closer.

5065
04:17:12,310 --> 04:17:12,870
Again.

5066
04:17:27,290 --> 04:17:29,210
Maybe I should eat and sleep.

5067
04:17:50,290 --> 04:17:51,280
Go meet it.

5068
04:17:51,280 --> 04:17:59,240
But... How do I set a point for the, uh... For the... For the dot.

5069
04:17:59,560 --> 04:18:01,440
Oh, wait, it's back where it originally was.

5070
04:18:02,460 --> 04:18:03,200
Enter key?

5071
04:18:18,020 --> 04:18:18,500
Wait.

5072
04:18:19,080 --> 04:18:20,680
I want to do, like, a hard save.

5073
04:18:20,900 --> 04:18:22,120
Oh, there is no hard save.

5074
04:18:48,270 --> 04:18:49,090
Goodbye, home.

5075
04:18:49,910 --> 04:18:50,150
Oh.

5076
04:19:06,390 --> 04:19:08,090
Uh... Can it go in the water?

5077
04:19:09,750 --> 04:19:11,830
We'll just cross the bridge, just in case.

5078
04:19:18,830 --> 04:19:21,230
I don't want it to get too far away from me, you know?

5079
04:19:21,410 --> 04:19:24,010
Since it was moving pretty... quickly, it seems.

5080
04:19:29,330 --> 04:19:30,550
What if it's something freaky?

5081
04:19:35,630 --> 04:19:36,630
I'm kind of scared.

5082
04:19:37,010 --> 04:19:37,950
But I'll be brave.

5083
04:19:42,170 --> 04:19:43,430
I ran over something.

5084
04:19:44,530 --> 04:19:46,110
Okay, we need to get back on the path.

5085
04:19:49,470 --> 04:19:51,710
Um... How do I get up there?

5086
04:19:54,910 --> 04:19:55,750
Speed!

5087
04:20:00,790 --> 04:20:02,990
Wow, I got an achievement.

5088
04:20:10,500 --> 04:20:12,200
We flipped, baby.

5089
04:20:22,710 --> 04:20:23,790
This way.

5090
04:20:26,330 --> 04:20:27,170
Wait.

5091
04:20:28,770 --> 04:20:29,370
Wait.

5092
04:20:29,610 --> 04:20:30,210
Opposite?

5093
04:20:33,980 --> 04:20:34,580
Huh?

5094
04:20:35,360 --> 04:20:36,720
I went past it.

5095
04:20:44,500 --> 04:20:45,680
Maybe I moved?

5096
04:20:49,620 --> 04:20:50,220
Aw...

5097
04:21:01,060 --> 04:21:02,460
There's a lot of rocks here.

5098
04:21:02,940 --> 04:21:03,480
I'll be careful.

5099
04:21:10,470 --> 04:21:11,890
Is it the whiskey pole?

5100
04:21:15,490 --> 04:21:17,810
I didn't see my sick flip and...

5101
04:21:19,190 --> 04:21:20,370
I got intimidated.

5102
04:21:21,050 --> 04:21:22,270
It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5103
04:21:22,770 --> 04:21:24,070
I can't go...

5104
04:21:24,070 --> 04:21:25,050
Over there?

5105
04:21:25,170 --> 04:21:26,330
That guy is way too cool.

5106
04:21:31,460 --> 04:21:32,340
That guy...

5107
04:21:32,340 --> 04:21:33,160
Did you see that?

5108
04:21:33,320 --> 04:21:34,560
That guy...

5109
04:21:34,560 --> 04:21:35,340
Did that thing?

5110
04:21:37,180 --> 04:21:38,620
He's way too cool.

5111
04:21:39,120 --> 04:21:40,040
Wait, how do I get home?

5112
04:21:41,100 --> 04:21:41,780
Okay, home.

5113
04:21:41,780 --> 04:21:42,380
Home, I'm back.

5114
04:21:45,920 --> 04:21:46,260
Um...

5115
04:21:46,600 --> 04:21:48,340
Whatever it was...

5116
04:21:48,340 --> 04:21:49,340
Is...

5117
04:21:49,340 --> 04:21:50,880
Maybe inside my house.

5118
04:21:54,380 --> 04:21:55,720
God, that scared me.

5119
04:22:04,220 --> 04:22:05,780
I think I hit...

5120
04:22:06,940 --> 04:22:07,620
Um...

5121
04:22:07,620 --> 04:22:08,640
I think I hit a rock.

5122
04:22:27,910 --> 04:22:29,310
It's down the floor.

5123
04:22:34,220 --> 04:22:34,840
Huh.

5124
04:22:35,420 --> 04:22:36,260
That's gone.

5125
04:22:38,480 --> 04:22:40,160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

5126
04:22:40,260 --> 04:22:41,500
Mint too scary.

5127
04:22:43,980 --> 04:22:45,120
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

5128
04:22:45,120 --> 04:22:46,480
I want to see something spooky.

5129
04:22:46,680 --> 04:22:49,220
Maybe I'll just let my sanity drain.

5130
04:22:49,900 --> 04:22:51,480
Or my stamina, I mean.

5131
04:22:52,700 --> 04:22:56,200
And then I'll call it, because I'm starting to get...

5132
04:22:56,200 --> 04:22:57,120
Eepy sleepy.

5133
04:23:00,360 --> 04:23:01,420
Eepy eepy.

5134
04:23:02,120 --> 04:23:04,260
I saw you with a c-c-c-ghost.

5135
04:23:08,200 --> 04:23:09,840
Maybe something else will appear.

5136
04:23:16,650 --> 04:23:19,390
Last time you had something scary happen, you hid under your desk.

5137
04:23:19,390 --> 04:23:21,570
I won't hide this time.

5138
04:23:22,970 --> 04:23:24,510
I won't hide.

5139
04:23:24,810 --> 04:23:27,310
I will be brave, and I will...

5140
04:23:28,390 --> 04:23:31,970
I will, it's because this time, I'm not afraid if I die.

5141
04:23:33,690 --> 04:23:34,510
You know?

5142
04:23:45,490 --> 04:23:46,950
If I hide...

5143
04:23:47,990 --> 04:23:50,060
You have permission to call me...

5144
04:23:50,890 --> 04:23:52,290
A chipmunk baby.

5145
04:23:55,530 --> 04:23:56,590
Anything gonna appear?

5146
04:23:57,290 --> 04:23:57,650
Anything...

5147
04:23:57,650 --> 04:23:59,010
You know what, in the meantime...

5148
04:23:59,010 --> 04:24:01,950
Let's clean our windows, so we can see if anything else freaky appears.

5149
04:24:01,950 --> 04:24:02,890
ha,

5150
04:24:12,440 --> 04:24:12,440
ha.

5151
04:24:15,200 --> 04:24:16,680
Eleven monthsate, though.

5152
04:24:16,860 --> 04:24:17,480
Dougie Kuu!

5153
04:24:25,880 --> 04:24:27,120
Dougie Kuuuu!

5154
04:24:28,420 --> 04:24:35,620
Dougie K-RIispos Dougie K-RIipkis Dougie K-RIipkis Uh, everybody is welcome to come over, I'm cleaning my house for you!

5155
04:24:38,540 --> 04:24:38,960
Thank you.

5156
04:24:38,960 --> 04:24:39,860
I'm cleaning my home.

5157
04:24:40,940 --> 04:24:42,440
I thought those were cracks.

5158
04:24:42,980 --> 04:24:44,500
That would be even worse, I think.

5159
04:24:46,020 --> 04:24:47,040
Actually not, I think.

5160
04:24:47,200 --> 04:24:47,480
I know.

5161
04:24:48,760 --> 04:24:50,880
Dear Krabs, thank you so much for the tech gift of the tech-go!

5162
04:25:05,270 --> 04:25:08,190
But this in and of itself is pretty relaxing.

5163
04:25:12,670 --> 04:25:18,130
We had the... I should have... I should have gone out to see the... the fog man.

5164
04:25:23,250 --> 04:25:25,610
I should have gone out to see the fog man.

5165
04:25:26,390 --> 04:25:27,770
I should have been brave then.

5166
04:25:28,290 --> 04:25:29,410
What if he doesn't come back?

5167
04:25:30,010 --> 04:25:31,230
What if... what if...

5168
04:25:31,850 --> 04:25:33,430
Here, I'll go unlock my doors.

5169
04:25:34,030 --> 04:25:36,130
So that my home seems really welcoming.

5170
04:25:44,720 --> 04:25:46,200
Everybody can come in.

5171
04:25:49,120 --> 04:25:50,460
Everybody is welcome.

5172
04:25:51,560 --> 04:25:52,120
Mi casa.

5173
04:25:56,220 --> 04:25:56,900
Uh...

5174
04:25:56,900 --> 04:25:58,200
Eh...

5175
04:25:58,200 --> 04:25:59,160
Tu casa.

5176
04:26:02,800 --> 04:26:03,500
Thoughts on the game?

5177
04:26:03,620 --> 04:26:04,300
Would you stream it again?

5178
04:26:04,660 --> 04:26:06,000
Oh, probably.

5179
04:26:06,940 --> 04:26:08,220
I like it.

5180
04:26:08,440 --> 04:26:10,080
It's... it's definitely a lot.

5181
04:26:10,080 --> 04:26:10,700
But...

5182
04:26:11,500 --> 04:26:11,980
Um...

5183
04:26:11,980 --> 04:26:14,080
I think I haven't had...

5184
04:26:16,100 --> 04:26:19,700
Enough happen yet for me to be, like, totally hooked, you know?

5185
04:26:25,590 --> 04:26:26,070
Um...

5186
04:26:26,670 --> 04:26:29,890
I think mostly, it's a bit... a lot to manage.

5187
04:26:30,210 --> 04:26:32,810
I feel like I can only focus on one thing.

5188
04:26:34,350 --> 04:26:34,830
Like...

5189
04:26:34,830 --> 04:26:38,130
It's like, oh, I can't do my job because I'm going to fix towers.

5190
04:26:38,150 --> 04:26:40,750
Oh, I can't fix towers because I need to make money.

5191
04:26:44,170 --> 04:26:45,670
Yeah, definitely a slow burn.

5192
04:26:45,810 --> 04:26:48,050
The atmosphere, though, is really, really great.

5193
04:26:53,030 --> 04:26:54,650
The atmosphere is...

5194
04:26:55,170 --> 04:26:55,550
Freaky.

5195
04:26:58,090 --> 04:27:00,150
It relies on you getting into a routine.

5196
04:27:00,150 --> 04:27:01,370
I can definitely see that.

5197
04:27:03,250 --> 04:27:05,110
Oh my gosh, I thought those were clouds.

5198
04:27:05,510 --> 04:27:07,450
That's why I didn't clean it at first.

5199
04:27:08,790 --> 04:27:09,790
What time is it?

5200
04:27:09,790 --> 04:27:10,830
It's still bright.

5201
04:27:11,070 --> 04:27:11,550
So maybe six?

5202
04:27:11,930 --> 04:27:12,350
Oh, eight.

5203
04:27:12,630 --> 04:27:12,750
Wow.

5204
04:27:14,450 --> 04:27:16,450
Do things happen freakier at night?

5205
04:27:17,030 --> 04:27:17,590
Or...

5206
04:27:17,590 --> 04:27:18,970
Is that just not the case?

5207
04:27:23,510 --> 04:27:24,890
Welcome to membership.

5208
04:27:25,130 --> 04:27:25,590
Thank you!

5209
04:27:26,270 --> 04:27:27,130
It is freakier?

5210
04:27:27,310 --> 04:27:27,810
Okay, cool.

5211
04:27:29,850 --> 04:27:31,710
You can force things through the...

5212
04:27:32,350 --> 04:27:32,630
Console.

5213
04:27:33,350 --> 04:27:34,450
What can I type?

5214
04:27:34,450 --> 04:27:35,190
Oh wait!

5215
04:27:35,370 --> 04:27:37,210
Some of you guys were telling me to type in Maxwell.

5216
04:27:39,930 --> 04:27:41,230
Oh, where'd the lights go?

5217
04:27:45,290 --> 04:27:46,810
Wow, I'm surprised everything's working.

5218
04:27:48,270 --> 04:27:48,730
Maxwell.

5219
04:27:50,550 --> 04:27:51,470
Find Maxwell!

5220
04:27:55,790 --> 04:27:57,290
What do you mean, find him?

5221
04:28:06,950 --> 04:28:08,430
Maxwell is now active.

5222
04:28:10,030 --> 04:28:11,570
You gotta go find him.

5223
04:28:11,690 --> 04:28:12,330
How do I know?

5224
04:28:13,350 --> 04:28:15,010
He's not even showing up on the thing.

5225
04:28:15,550 --> 04:28:15,730
Did he?

5226
04:28:16,370 --> 04:28:16,750
No?

5227
04:28:23,250 --> 04:28:25,010
He plays his song, you'll hear him.

5228
04:28:25,190 --> 04:28:25,730
Oh, okay.

5229
04:28:28,030 --> 04:28:29,390
He makes a sound.

5230
04:28:47,990 --> 04:28:49,870
The roaches get him?

5231
04:28:55,190 --> 04:28:56,340
Oh yeah, my download.

5232
04:28:56,620 --> 04:28:57,040
Thank you.

5233
04:28:58,200 --> 04:28:59,920
It's still at 57%.

5234
04:29:00,270 --> 04:29:01,380
It's working on it.

5235
04:29:01,560 --> 04:29:02,600
Very slowly.

5236
04:29:10,690 --> 04:29:11,890
My sleep?

5237
04:29:12,150 --> 04:29:13,390
I'm getting pretty sleepy.

5238
04:29:13,590 --> 04:29:14,550
So I think...

5239
04:29:14,930 --> 04:29:17,090
Am I starting to...

5240
04:29:17,090 --> 04:29:18,710
I'm not drifting yet.

5241
04:29:20,470 --> 04:29:22,990
I don't have the Joy-Con drift...

5242
04:29:22,990 --> 04:29:23,990
Just yet.

5243
04:29:27,210 --> 04:29:28,590
Scrub the floors too.

5244
04:29:28,710 --> 04:29:29,610
What am I, a maid?

5245
04:29:32,850 --> 04:29:34,250
Cinderella, Cinderella.

5246
04:29:34,830 --> 04:29:36,310
Scrub the floors, Cinderella.

5247
04:29:40,170 --> 04:29:42,230
It's not coming up.

5248
04:29:45,270 --> 04:29:46,550
Oh, yes it is.

5249
04:29:51,130 --> 04:29:52,570
Cinderella, Cinderella.

5250
04:29:53,050 --> 04:29:54,370
Night and day, it's Cinderella.

5251
04:29:55,010 --> 04:29:56,930
Scrub the floors, type in Maxwell.

5252
04:29:57,670 --> 04:29:59,710
Go outside, lock your doors.

5253
04:30:00,010 --> 04:30:01,390
VTuber, what are you doing?

5254
04:30:02,230 --> 04:30:03,850
The chat is always yelling.

5255
04:30:11,450 --> 04:30:12,670
Nothing yet.

5256
04:30:12,670 --> 04:30:12,790
What?

5257
04:30:16,110 --> 04:30:17,070
I'm like...

5258
04:30:17,070 --> 04:30:20,230
My ATV is like looking at me so...

5259
04:30:20,890 --> 04:30:21,370
So...

5260
04:30:22,050 --> 04:30:22,530
Um...

5261
04:30:22,530 --> 04:30:25,630
Menacingly, I'm half expecting it to like...

5262
04:30:25,630 --> 04:30:27,170
Become a Transformer.

5263
04:30:31,310 --> 04:30:31,790
Like...

5264
04:30:31,790 --> 04:30:34,250
Get up on two legs and come at me.

5265
04:30:37,270 --> 04:30:39,150
Nothing much happens in early game.

5266
04:30:39,270 --> 04:30:40,790
What would you consider early game?

5267
04:30:40,790 --> 04:30:41,810
Well, I guess...

5268
04:30:41,810 --> 04:30:43,050
It said like day...

5269
04:30:43,590 --> 04:30:44,990
Start out of...

5270
04:30:44,990 --> 04:30:46,490
Day one out of seven.

5271
04:30:46,810 --> 04:30:48,010
Is it a type of...

5272
04:30:48,010 --> 04:30:49,890
Is it one of those types of games?

5273
04:30:49,970 --> 04:30:51,130
Where you...

5274
04:30:51,130 --> 04:30:53,230
Only go until day seven?

5275
04:30:53,410 --> 04:30:54,790
I feel like it can't...

5276
04:30:59,580 --> 04:31:01,560
Pre-dive in armor.

5277
04:31:05,140 --> 04:31:07,060
Five days is early.

5278
04:31:07,060 --> 04:31:07,920
Oh...

5279
04:31:07,920 --> 04:31:08,400
Okay, okay.

5280
04:31:11,700 --> 04:31:13,460
Wow, I'm surprised I'm not...

5281
04:31:13,460 --> 04:31:14,960
Collapsed and falling over.

5282
04:31:15,000 --> 04:31:15,760
I'm so sleepy.

5283
04:31:25,650 --> 04:31:27,310
Should we go look for Maxwell?

5284
04:31:29,430 --> 04:31:29,750
Oh!

5285
04:31:30,030 --> 04:31:30,870
There it is.

5286
04:31:34,290 --> 04:31:35,410
There's the drift.

5287
04:31:45,400 --> 04:31:47,140
You won't find him easily.

5288
04:31:47,900 --> 04:31:49,120
Oh, my flashlight.

5289
04:31:49,380 --> 04:31:50,360
Oh my gosh, thank you.

5290
04:31:51,060 --> 04:31:52,500
My flashlight almost is out.

5291
04:31:53,380 --> 04:31:54,740
I completely forgot.

5292
04:32:02,120 --> 04:32:03,110
If I...

5293
04:32:03,440 --> 04:32:04,460
Get to...

5294
04:32:04,460 --> 04:32:06,340
Sleepy Zero...

5295
04:32:06,900 --> 04:32:08,160
What will happen?

5296
04:32:15,870 --> 04:32:16,530
Something.

5297
04:32:17,370 --> 04:32:19,470
We'll let it happen and then I'll...

5298
04:32:19,470 --> 04:32:20,270
Then I'll call it.

5299
04:32:25,310 --> 04:32:26,050
Who knows?

5300
04:32:28,410 --> 04:32:29,450
Something will happen.

5301
04:32:30,170 --> 04:32:32,430
I'm excited to have something happen.

5302
04:32:34,830 --> 04:32:37,530
I don't really don't mind slow burn games like this though.

5303
04:32:37,650 --> 04:32:37,990
It...

5304
04:32:37,990 --> 04:32:39,030
It gives you...

5305
04:32:39,290 --> 04:32:40,590
Quite a lot to do.

5306
04:32:42,230 --> 04:32:42,910
Uh...

5307
04:32:44,150 --> 04:32:45,510
Even when...

5308
04:32:46,690 --> 04:32:47,370
Um...

5309
04:32:48,890 --> 04:32:49,570
When...

5310
04:32:49,570 --> 04:32:49,890
Uh...

5311
04:32:49,890 --> 04:32:52,030
You know, the spooky happenings aren't happening.

5312
04:33:02,200 --> 04:33:04,820
I can't tell if you guys are hyping this up or not.

5313
04:33:06,780 --> 04:33:08,440
Good yap game.

5314
04:33:08,920 --> 04:33:09,440
Yeah.

5315
04:33:14,750 --> 04:33:15,830
Let's see.

5316
04:33:18,520 --> 04:33:19,410
Four still.

5317
04:33:20,650 --> 04:33:22,390
A24 the game.

5318
04:33:26,530 --> 04:33:27,430
I...

5319
04:33:27,430 --> 04:33:29,690
You know...

5320
04:33:29,690 --> 04:33:30,690
Uh...

5321
04:33:32,190 --> 04:33:32,710
Uh...

5322
04:33:32,710 --> 04:33:33,670
Uh...

5323
04:33:33,670 --> 04:33:36,950
Like I said, I'm much more of an atmosphere type of...

5324
04:33:36,950 --> 04:33:38,650
Horror fan than like...

5325
04:33:38,650 --> 04:33:41,390
In your face, jump scare, woo-woah, type of fan.

5326
04:33:42,710 --> 04:33:43,230
So...

5327
04:33:43,230 --> 04:33:45,910
To me, A24 movies typically...

5328
04:33:45,910 --> 04:33:47,930
Hit that on the...

5329
04:33:47,930 --> 04:33:51,010
Head for me and all, but...

5330
04:33:54,640 --> 04:33:55,500
Wait, the...

5331
04:33:55,500 --> 04:33:58,360
The drift is actually kind of good for my...

5332
04:33:58,360 --> 04:33:58,920
Watch.

5333
04:34:00,800 --> 04:34:03,660
I slowly move over and clean the rest.

5334
04:34:07,320 --> 04:34:09,300
Oh, why did it save just then?

5335
04:34:09,840 --> 04:34:11,060
That's kind of evil, no?

5336
04:34:16,660 --> 04:34:19,240
Your download will be slow if it's offline.

5337
04:34:20,280 --> 04:34:20,880
Oh...

5338
04:34:22,480 --> 04:34:24,080
Is that why it's so slow?

5339
04:34:24,840 --> 04:34:25,140
What?

5340
04:34:32,270 --> 04:34:33,110
What?

5341
04:34:33,110 --> 04:34:33,870
He's here.

5342
04:34:34,310 --> 04:34:35,250
The eyes?

5343
04:34:35,410 --> 04:34:35,910
What eyes?

5344
04:34:39,030 --> 04:34:40,490
What do you guys see?

5345
04:34:41,650 --> 04:34:42,370
Eyes?

5346
04:34:44,830 --> 04:34:46,010
Look near the shower.

5347
04:34:57,580 --> 04:34:59,660
There were eyes by the shower.

5348
04:35:00,620 --> 04:35:01,040
Really?

5349
04:35:02,760 --> 04:35:03,960
Oh, I see him!

5350
04:35:04,840 --> 04:35:05,900
I saw them!

5351
04:35:07,280 --> 04:35:08,760
If I look at him...

5352
04:35:08,760 --> 04:35:09,820
They go away.

5353
04:35:11,980 --> 04:35:12,820
You see it?

5354
04:35:12,920 --> 04:35:13,420
You see it?

5355
04:35:22,810 --> 04:35:23,330
Oh!

5356
04:35:26,310 --> 04:35:27,910
He doesn't look so scary.

5357
04:35:29,370 --> 04:35:30,390
He's just kind of like...

5358
04:35:30,390 --> 04:35:30,910
He's just kind of like...

5359
04:35:31,670 --> 04:35:33,070
La la la la la...

5360
04:35:34,910 --> 04:35:37,230
La la la la la...

5361
04:35:39,370 --> 04:35:40,570
Is he on the radar?

5362
04:35:40,770 --> 04:35:41,910
No, I don't think so.

5363
04:35:42,090 --> 04:35:42,250
Oh!

5364
04:35:42,390 --> 04:35:43,230
What's that over there?

5365
04:35:43,370 --> 04:35:43,970
Is that Maxwell?

5366
04:35:48,270 --> 04:35:48,630
Sleep?

5367
04:35:48,870 --> 04:35:49,350
Oh, no, no.

5368
04:35:49,430 --> 04:35:50,350
I'm trying to get this.

5369
04:35:50,570 --> 04:35:51,730
I'm trying to see what happens.

5370
04:35:53,730 --> 04:35:54,410
Don't worry.

5371
04:35:54,530 --> 04:35:54,930
Don't worry.

5372
04:35:55,290 --> 04:35:56,730
I'm trying to see what happens.

5373
04:36:00,130 --> 04:36:01,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5374
04:36:04,930 --> 04:36:06,770
Maxwell doesn't appear on the radar.

5375
04:36:09,190 --> 04:36:10,010
Oh, my God!

5376
04:36:10,030 --> 04:36:12,510
I thought my ATV was the eyeballs!

5377
04:36:14,770 --> 04:36:15,250
Freaky!

5378
04:36:18,170 --> 04:36:20,310
Really, nothing's going on out here, though.

5379
04:36:20,790 --> 04:36:23,710
It's supposed to be raining, but it doesn't look so...

5380
04:36:23,710 --> 04:36:24,630
Bad out.

5381
04:36:26,690 --> 04:36:27,130
Oh.

5382
04:36:27,570 --> 04:36:28,470
Wait, where'd the eyes go?

5383
04:36:30,490 --> 04:36:31,730
Am I gonna get jump scared?

5384
04:36:33,690 --> 04:36:34,950
Wait, I wanna get jump scared.

5385
04:36:35,750 --> 04:36:36,570
Wait, the eyes are gone.

5386
04:36:49,230 --> 04:36:50,270
I don't see them!

5387
04:36:53,920 --> 04:36:56,560
Whatever that is, I think it's also...

5388
04:36:58,020 --> 04:36:59,880
Lower your volume, just in case.

5389
04:37:00,500 --> 04:37:01,740
It's kind of a jump scare.

5390
04:37:01,860 --> 04:37:02,420
Not really, though.

5391
04:37:02,640 --> 04:37:03,720
Okay, thanks for the warning.

5392
04:37:06,020 --> 04:37:06,900
Where'd he go?

5393
04:37:07,520 --> 04:37:09,040
Oh, my...

5394
04:37:09,040 --> 04:37:10,080
My sleep!

5395
04:37:22,430 --> 04:37:23,670
Hungry and tired.

5396
04:37:23,870 --> 04:37:24,830
Worst combination ever.

5397
04:37:28,530 --> 04:37:31,170
I'm not gonna hide under the desk, so you can't...

5398
04:37:31,170 --> 04:37:32,170
Call me a chipmunk baby!

5399
04:37:38,130 --> 04:37:38,690
Oh...

5400
04:37:38,690 --> 04:37:39,090
One?

5401
04:37:40,630 --> 04:37:41,410
Ta-da!

5402
04:37:45,270 --> 04:37:47,030
Nice vantage point, yeah.

5403
04:37:49,710 --> 04:37:52,450
What if he comes from behind me?

5404
04:37:54,370 --> 04:37:55,210
Two?

5405
04:37:57,050 --> 04:37:57,890
Seven.

5406
04:37:59,130 --> 04:37:59,970
Six.

5407
04:38:02,210 --> 04:38:03,770
Is the lightning from him?

5408
04:38:03,970 --> 04:38:06,230
Or is it just a...

5409
04:38:14,660 --> 04:38:16,120
It's just the weather.

5410
04:38:16,520 --> 04:38:16,680
Okay.

5411
04:38:17,520 --> 04:38:17,780
Two!

5412
04:38:19,560 --> 04:38:20,680
Oh, man.

5413
04:38:22,380 --> 04:38:23,480
Uh-oh.

5414
04:38:24,160 --> 04:38:24,580
One!

5415
04:38:24,580 --> 04:38:24,700
One!

5416
04:38:25,080 --> 04:38:25,340
One!

5417
04:38:26,800 --> 04:38:28,080
I'm out of water.

5418
04:38:28,220 --> 04:38:28,500
Zero!

5419
04:38:36,960 --> 04:38:37,720
Uh...

5420
04:38:37,720 --> 04:38:38,180
Happy...

5421
04:38:38,180 --> 04:38:39,280
Happy New Year!

5422
04:38:52,110 --> 04:38:52,490
Uh...

5423
04:38:52,490 --> 04:38:53,870
Wait, I didn't die.

5424
04:38:57,650 --> 04:38:59,350
I passed out.

5425
04:38:59,350 --> 04:38:59,450
What?

5426
04:39:06,830 --> 04:39:08,390
I didn't die.

5427
04:39:15,480 --> 04:39:16,780
He got stuck?

5428
04:39:17,260 --> 04:39:18,320
No kidding?

5429
04:39:22,180 --> 04:39:24,580
The transformers went out?

5430
04:39:32,830 --> 04:39:34,110
No.

5431
04:39:50,690 --> 04:39:52,530
And it's daytime.

5432
04:39:54,810 --> 04:39:55,890
Ha ha ha ha ha.

5433
04:40:03,650 --> 04:40:04,650
My sponge.

5434
04:40:08,490 --> 04:40:09,710
Good morning, Mito.

5435
04:40:14,240 --> 04:40:15,660
Try loading the save.

5436
04:40:16,680 --> 04:40:19,180
I think it... Wait, where?

5437
04:40:19,260 --> 04:40:19,840
How do I load?

5438
04:40:20,080 --> 04:40:27,260
I think it, um... Oh yeah, I was gonna say, I think it say, like, auto-saved.

5439
04:40:43,850 --> 04:40:44,190
Ah!

5440
04:40:48,510 --> 04:40:50,810
I've never felt more blue balled in my life.

5441
04:40:51,170 --> 04:40:51,810
Me too!

5442
04:40:56,030 --> 04:40:58,430
Well... Um, I have no power.

5443
04:40:59,490 --> 04:41:01,010
That's pretty freaky.

5444
04:41:06,690 --> 04:41:07,830
Check the basement.

5445
04:41:08,150 --> 04:41:10,410
Just in case it's those breakers that went out.

5446
04:41:16,950 --> 04:41:17,950
I will try.

5447
04:41:23,360 --> 04:41:23,980
Uh...

5448
04:41:25,640 --> 04:41:26,020
Uh!

5449
04:41:26,500 --> 04:41:28,020
Scared the heck out of me.

5450
04:41:28,420 --> 04:41:28,720
Wait.

5451
04:41:31,740 --> 04:41:33,340
My battery is out!

5452
04:41:37,830 --> 04:41:39,450
What a terrible timing.

5453
04:41:40,050 --> 04:41:40,950
Oh my god.

5454
04:41:42,130 --> 04:41:42,690
Wait.

5455
04:41:43,030 --> 04:41:43,590
Oh my god.

5456
04:41:45,110 --> 04:41:45,670
Wait.

5457
04:41:45,870 --> 04:41:46,210
Flashlight.

5458
04:41:46,470 --> 04:41:46,590
Hold.

5459
04:41:49,230 --> 04:41:49,790
Wait.

5460
04:41:49,850 --> 04:41:50,750
What do you mean it's not equipped?

5461
04:41:55,310 --> 04:41:55,870
Wait.

5462
04:41:56,150 --> 04:41:56,930
It is... Wait.

5463
04:41:56,990 --> 04:41:57,890
What did I do with it?

5464
04:41:58,570 --> 04:41:59,070
Huh?

5465
04:41:59,070 --> 04:41:59,070
Huh?

5466
04:42:02,910 --> 04:42:08,510
What did I... It's in my hand?

5467
04:42:19,420 --> 04:42:22,300
I... I... What

5468
04:42:26,550 --> 04:42:27,310
just happened to me?

5469
04:42:32,180 --> 04:42:33,420
What just happened?

5470
04:42:34,100 --> 04:42:35,380
Oh, because I'm hungry.

5471
04:42:35,580 --> 04:42:36,660
Hungry equals ragdoll.

5472
04:42:36,820 --> 04:42:37,780
Oh, okay.

5473
04:42:38,380 --> 04:42:41,320
How do I... Oh my god.

5474
04:42:41,660 --> 04:42:42,760
I'm trying.

5475
04:42:43,200 --> 04:42:43,660
I'm trying.

5476
04:42:44,560 --> 04:42:45,340
Okay, hold on.

5477
04:42:45,780 --> 04:42:47,280
We gotta eat first.

5478
04:42:47,880 --> 04:42:49,460
We gotta eat first.

5479
04:42:53,140 --> 04:42:55,200
Okay, that should... That should be enough for us.

5480
04:42:55,300 --> 04:42:55,480
Alright.

5481
04:42:56,380 --> 04:42:58,560
How do I know what battery is good and what's not?

5482
04:43:10,150 --> 04:43:11,470
Just keep trying them?

5483
04:43:24,470 --> 04:43:25,810
Oh my god.

5484
04:43:29,990 --> 04:43:34,310
I... I can't tell which... Are all the batteries used up?

5485
04:43:37,490 --> 04:43:39,030
Stacking off, then try them all.

5486
04:43:39,310 --> 04:43:39,770
Okay, okay.

5487
04:43:47,060 --> 04:43:47,420
Drop.

5488
04:43:51,710 --> 04:43:53,470
But it like puts it back in my inventory.

5489
04:43:53,470 --> 04:43:54,750
I don't know which ones I've...

5490
04:44:06,270 --> 04:44:08,390
Um... Okay, so I can drop this one probably.

5491
04:44:08,570 --> 04:44:08,910
Oh my gosh.

5492
04:44:08,910 --> 04:44:09,770
Go, sure.

5493
04:44:10,130 --> 04:44:11,290
Thank you so much for the 15 minutes.

5494
04:44:11,390 --> 04:44:11,930
And thank you.

5495
04:44:14,970 --> 04:44:15,890
Okay, okay, okay.

5496
04:44:15,970 --> 04:44:16,270
Hold on.

5497
04:44:17,810 --> 04:44:18,850
Oh my gosh.

5498
04:44:19,990 --> 04:44:21,450
I'm just gonna try a middle one.

5499
04:44:23,250 --> 04:44:24,010
There we go.

5500
04:44:33,650 --> 04:44:34,590
I made it.

5501
04:44:42,100 --> 04:44:44,040
We made it.

5502
04:44:49,570 --> 04:44:50,030
Yay.

5503
04:44:55,930 --> 04:44:57,550
Okay, I'll eat some more.

5504
04:44:57,750 --> 04:44:58,410
Goodness gracious.

5505
04:45:10,990 --> 04:45:12,050
In the end...

5506
04:45:14,650 --> 04:45:16,010
Nothing happened.

5507
04:45:16,570 --> 04:45:18,070
Wait, we can go to this thing.

5508
04:45:19,470 --> 04:45:20,390
Maybe.

5509
04:45:20,930 --> 04:45:20,950
Maybe.

5510
04:45:22,650 --> 04:45:23,250
Oh.

5511
04:45:23,470 --> 04:45:23,910
Oops.

5512
04:45:30,600 --> 04:45:32,860
It's not moving as fast as the other thing.

5513
04:45:35,720 --> 04:45:36,320
Ah.

5514
04:45:41,110 --> 04:45:42,950
It's moving barely, barely.

5515
04:45:43,710 --> 04:45:44,610
Barely, barely.

5516
04:45:45,130 --> 04:45:45,670
Let's go.

5517
04:45:48,610 --> 04:45:49,210
Hahaha.

5518
04:45:49,870 --> 04:45:51,350
Did you find the...

5519
04:45:51,350 --> 04:45:51,990
Ah...

5520
04:45:51,990 --> 04:45:53,350
The rose yet?

5521
04:45:54,210 --> 04:45:55,670
No, I haven't found anything.

5522
04:46:01,170 --> 04:46:02,570
What do you mean a tree?

5523
04:46:03,030 --> 04:46:04,330
How could it be a tree?

5524
04:46:08,250 --> 04:46:09,770
How could it be a tree?

5525
04:46:33,080 --> 04:46:34,320
Oh, you hear music.

5526
04:46:38,890 --> 04:46:39,570
Maxwell?

5527
04:46:44,420 --> 04:46:45,420
He's close.

5528
04:46:56,750 --> 04:46:57,850
I hear him.

5529
04:47:07,890 --> 04:47:08,550
Cold.

5530
04:47:09,330 --> 04:47:09,990
Oh,

5531
04:47:14,550 --> 04:47:14,870
thank you.

5532
04:47:15,290 --> 04:47:16,010
Whoever made it.

5533
04:47:16,050 --> 04:47:16,490
I'm so sorry.

5534
04:47:16,610 --> 04:47:17,110
I didn't see it.

5535
04:47:17,610 --> 04:47:18,050
Oh.

5536
04:47:19,110 --> 04:47:20,010
I'm okay.

5537
04:47:20,590 --> 04:47:21,920
Who said that this game's...

5538
04:47:22,990 --> 04:47:23,650
Fall?

5539
04:47:24,550 --> 04:47:27,690
Someone said that this game was pretty forgiving on...

5540
04:47:28,490 --> 04:47:29,150
On...

5541
04:47:29,150 --> 04:47:30,150
On...

5542
04:47:30,930 --> 04:47:32,230
With the, uh...

5543
04:47:32,230 --> 04:47:32,950
Fall damage.

5544
04:47:33,390 --> 04:47:33,770
Hahaha.

5545
04:47:37,870 --> 04:47:39,170
We're so close.

5546
04:47:40,150 --> 04:47:41,410
I think he's up there.

5547
04:47:41,630 --> 04:47:42,310
Oh gosh.

5548
04:47:51,780 --> 04:47:53,300
I mean, you're alive.

5549
04:47:53,980 --> 04:47:54,460
Okay, fair.

5550
04:48:01,430 --> 04:48:03,910
I think I have to go up here...

5551
04:48:03,910 --> 04:48:05,510
To get to him.

5552
04:48:18,220 --> 04:48:19,220
I don't know.

5553
04:48:20,360 --> 04:48:21,640
It's so hard to tell.

5554
04:48:24,980 --> 04:48:25,800
He's below?

5555
04:48:30,430 --> 04:48:31,410
But where?

5556
04:48:32,230 --> 04:48:34,190
At least I get a vantage point from here.

5557
04:48:40,410 --> 04:48:41,930
Do not jump.

5558
04:48:42,490 --> 04:48:43,670
I passed him?

5559
04:48:43,830 --> 04:48:44,210
I did?

5560
04:48:56,970 --> 04:48:57,870
Oh gosh.

5561
04:48:58,010 --> 04:49:00,550
That light post scared the heck out of me.

5562
04:49:07,710 --> 04:49:09,130
Just follow the music.

5563
04:49:43,050 --> 04:49:44,570
I don't see it.

5564
04:49:44,750 --> 04:49:44,850
Oh.

5565
04:49:44,950 --> 04:49:45,270
Oh shoot.

5566
04:49:46,310 --> 04:49:47,650
I didn't mean to.

5567
04:49:51,960 --> 04:49:52,520
Sorry.

5568
04:49:52,740 --> 04:49:53,180
I didn't mean to.

5569
04:49:54,880 --> 04:49:56,040
Where is he?

5570
04:50:04,430 --> 04:50:05,350
It's him.

5571
04:50:05,670 --> 04:50:06,910
He's right near the fence.

5572
04:50:20,220 --> 04:50:21,620
Oh, I see him.

5573
04:50:22,740 --> 04:50:23,300
I

5574
04:50:28,700 --> 04:50:30,100
thought he would be...

5575
04:50:30,100 --> 04:50:30,640
Oh yeah.

5576
04:50:30,680 --> 04:50:32,260
I have been saved by...

5577
04:50:32,260 --> 04:50:33,780
By finding Maxwell.

5578
04:50:34,060 --> 04:50:35,660
I thought he would be spinning.

5579
04:50:44,690 --> 04:50:45,650
Can I pet him?

5580
04:50:47,410 --> 04:50:48,430
I can't do anything.

5581
04:50:48,670 --> 04:50:48,870
Oh wait.

5582
04:50:49,070 --> 04:50:49,310
I can.

5583
04:50:50,310 --> 04:50:50,790
Toggle.

5584
04:50:51,890 --> 04:50:52,370
Maxwell.

5585
04:50:53,530 --> 04:50:54,010
Dingus.

5586
04:50:59,460 --> 04:50:59,860
Oh.

5587
04:51:03,280 --> 04:51:04,920
Oh, he's purring.

5588
04:51:06,440 --> 04:51:07,320
Okay, Maxwell.

5589
04:51:07,520 --> 04:51:09,540
I'm going to try and get us down from here without dying.

5590
04:51:14,020 --> 04:51:15,640
He was so close to home.

5591
04:51:25,260 --> 04:51:26,160
I'll just...

5592
04:51:26,160 --> 04:51:26,600
I'll just...

5593
04:51:26,600 --> 04:51:27,700
I'll just, uh...

5594
04:51:27,700 --> 04:51:29,980
Walk him home and put him inside.

5595
04:51:31,500 --> 04:51:32,060
I

5596
04:51:40,050 --> 04:51:40,710
have a cat!

5597
04:51:43,470 --> 04:51:44,790
I have a child.

5598
04:51:56,740 --> 04:51:59,180
Okay, I'm going to leave you here for right now, Maxwell.

5599
04:52:03,690 --> 04:52:04,630
How do I...

5600
04:52:04,630 --> 04:52:05,430
How do I drop him?

5601
04:52:05,650 --> 04:52:06,630
Without throwing him?

5602
04:52:07,130 --> 04:52:07,670
Uh...

5603
04:52:07,670 --> 04:52:08,050
Carefully.

5604
04:52:08,530 --> 04:52:08,830
Oops.

5605
04:52:11,470 --> 04:52:12,330
He's purring.

5606
04:52:12,450 --> 04:52:12,790
He's fine.

5607
04:52:12,790 --> 04:52:13,090
Okay.

5608
04:52:16,350 --> 04:52:16,810
Okay.

5609
04:52:21,800 --> 04:52:22,720
Okay, uh...

5610
04:52:22,720 --> 04:52:23,200
Let's go...

5611
04:52:23,200 --> 04:52:26,680
Actually, I'm going to go check the radar real quick to see if that thing is even still there.

5612
04:52:30,430 --> 04:52:33,010
I really wanted to stop stream like an hour ago.

5613
04:52:34,230 --> 04:52:34,690
So...

5614
04:52:40,030 --> 04:52:42,050
I did not move those mannequins.

5615
04:52:53,650 --> 04:52:54,750
There's a second thing.

5616
04:53:00,670 --> 04:53:01,990
This is even closer.

5617
04:53:06,880 --> 04:53:08,360
Oh, that's just my ATV.

5618
04:53:08,600 --> 04:53:08,900
Oh, okay.

5619
04:53:08,960 --> 04:53:10,020
Then we're actually pretty close.

5620
04:53:14,670 --> 04:53:17,130
I forgot that my bike shows up on the thing.

5621
04:53:27,520 --> 04:53:28,680
Excuse me?

5622
04:53:34,080 --> 04:53:35,360
What just happened?

5623
04:53:45,220 --> 04:53:47,060
Did I just run into the wall?

5624
04:53:47,220 --> 04:53:47,920
Is that what happened?

5625
04:53:50,720 --> 04:53:53,660
I can't believe we found Maxwell so fast.

5626
04:53:53,660 --> 04:53:55,500
Everyone was like, You will never find him.

5627
04:53:58,600 --> 04:54:00,040
Where's my car?

5628
04:54:01,680 --> 04:54:02,240
Wait.

5629
04:54:09,670 --> 04:54:10,270
Uh...

5630
04:54:31,650 --> 04:54:32,250
Okay.

5631
04:54:39,330 --> 04:54:39,930
Okay.

5632
04:54:40,850 --> 04:54:42,430
Let's go after this thing.

5633
04:54:44,430 --> 04:54:47,610
It looked like it was on the road, so...

5634
04:54:47,610 --> 04:54:48,990
Whatever it is.

5635
04:54:48,990 --> 04:54:50,310
I just want to see...

5636
04:54:50,310 --> 04:54:51,190
A creature.

5637
04:54:51,810 --> 04:54:53,370
Even if it's just a deer.

5638
04:54:56,990 --> 04:54:57,870
Where is?

5639
04:54:58,750 --> 04:55:00,250
At least we saw Maxwell.

5640
04:55:02,610 --> 04:55:03,230
Oh.

5641
04:55:03,570 --> 04:55:04,270
I passed it?

5642
04:55:09,870 --> 04:55:10,810
Please don't.

5643
04:55:11,810 --> 04:55:13,070
Uh, please don't.

5644
04:55:14,330 --> 04:55:15,290
Okay, I think it's good.

5645
04:55:20,170 --> 04:55:21,250
Oh, what's that?

5646
04:55:22,290 --> 04:55:23,270
There's a house.

5647
04:55:30,610 --> 04:55:32,230
I mean till I've been here.

5648
04:55:32,410 --> 04:55:34,710
How can you tell blood splatter for the fall damage?

5649
04:55:49,620 --> 04:55:51,500
A little shack in the middle of nowhere.

5650
04:56:00,710 --> 04:56:01,810
How do I get in?

5651
04:56:08,490 --> 04:56:10,070
What the hell is that?

5652
04:56:13,920 --> 04:56:15,500
I think I see a creature!

5653
04:56:17,480 --> 04:56:18,260
Or something.

5654
04:56:27,890 --> 04:56:29,270
What is that?

5655
04:56:37,920 --> 04:56:39,200
Oh my god.

5656
04:56:39,480 --> 04:56:40,640
Does that sound just...

5657
04:56:40,640 --> 04:56:41,780
Pinecoats falling?

5658
04:56:46,150 --> 04:56:47,110
Oh wait.

5659
04:56:47,230 --> 04:56:48,290
I don't think that's a creature.

5660
04:56:49,390 --> 04:56:50,670
That's just...

5661
04:56:50,670 --> 04:56:51,270
A plant.

5662
04:56:55,590 --> 04:56:57,470
I don't think I can get inside.

5663
04:57:00,440 --> 04:57:00,810
Aww.

5664
04:57:02,750 --> 04:57:04,010
That's disappointing.

5665
04:57:08,350 --> 04:57:09,390
You can?

5666
04:57:14,090 --> 04:57:15,150
No, but like...

5667
04:57:16,310 --> 04:57:16,870
How...

5668
04:57:16,870 --> 04:57:17,450
From where?

5669
04:57:17,910 --> 04:57:18,690
Yeah, the hole.

5670
04:57:18,970 --> 04:57:19,090
Yeah.

5671
04:57:19,630 --> 04:57:20,330
Oh my god.

5672
04:57:20,670 --> 04:57:21,910
It scares the heck out of me.

5673
04:57:27,010 --> 04:57:28,910
Why is there a bone here?

5674
04:57:37,970 --> 04:57:38,530
Wait.

5675
04:57:39,830 --> 04:57:41,690
Why are there several bones here?

5676
04:57:44,130 --> 04:57:45,410
That's not a pinecone.

5677
04:57:52,380 --> 04:57:54,360
There's bones coming from this tree.

5678
04:57:59,550 --> 04:58:00,050
Freaky.

5679
04:58:00,690 --> 04:58:01,210
What's this?

5680
04:58:02,010 --> 04:58:02,890
Piece of paper.

5681
04:58:03,210 --> 04:58:04,710
Why is this all the way out here?

5682
04:58:08,420 --> 04:58:09,080
Hold on.

5683
04:58:09,220 --> 04:58:10,260
Where did I put my ATV?

5684
04:58:15,610 --> 04:58:19,070
Some people said to use it for, uh...

5685
04:58:20,750 --> 04:58:22,510
To get on top of the roof.

5686
04:58:22,730 --> 04:58:23,470
Which is a good idea.

5687
04:58:23,670 --> 04:58:24,450
You guys are so smart.

5688
04:58:31,900 --> 04:58:32,380
Okay.

5689
04:58:36,540 --> 04:58:37,900
Maybe here is okay?

5690
04:58:39,580 --> 04:58:39,840
Oh.

5691
04:58:40,340 --> 04:58:40,760
Uh.

5692
04:58:45,310 --> 04:58:45,790
Um.

5693
04:58:45,990 --> 04:58:46,190
Wait.

5694
04:58:46,530 --> 04:58:47,730
A little bit over more.

5695
04:58:49,010 --> 04:58:52,730
We got a bone to pick with those pinecones.

5696
04:58:52,970 --> 04:58:53,450
Okay.

5697
04:59:01,450 --> 04:59:01,970
Uh.

5698
04:59:02,890 --> 04:59:04,650
That sounded kind of...

5699
04:59:05,030 --> 04:59:05,570
Musical.

5700
04:59:12,210 --> 04:59:13,650
But nothing dropped.

5701
04:59:18,370 --> 04:59:19,390
Oh, I got it.

5702
04:59:20,050 --> 04:59:20,450
Lucky.

5703
04:59:23,490 --> 04:59:24,730
I'm scared.

5704
04:59:25,010 --> 04:59:25,530
Ha ha ha.

5705
04:59:35,380 --> 04:59:36,980
How do I get out of here?

5706
04:59:40,140 --> 04:59:40,780
Spooky.

5707
04:59:41,120 --> 04:59:41,840
What do you mean?

5708
04:59:42,220 --> 04:59:43,080
Now it begins.

5709
04:59:43,820 --> 04:59:45,060
What do you mean by that?

5710
04:59:46,000 --> 04:59:47,200
Ha ha ha ha.

5711
04:59:47,820 --> 04:59:49,080
I don't like that.

5712
04:59:53,820 --> 04:59:54,840
Trophy head.

5713
04:59:57,520 --> 04:59:58,500
Aw, man.

5714
04:59:59,220 --> 05:00:00,420
I broke it.

5715
05:00:01,440 --> 05:00:02,000
Boar.

5716
05:00:06,990 --> 05:00:07,630
Paper.

5717
05:00:07,630 --> 05:00:07,730
Boar.

5718
05:00:08,950 --> 05:00:09,550
Oh.

5719
05:00:11,570 --> 05:00:12,170
Bloody.

5720
05:00:13,690 --> 05:00:14,290
Bloody.

5721
05:00:14,750 --> 05:00:14,910
Bloody.

5722
05:00:16,530 --> 05:00:17,130
Hanky.

5723
05:00:19,890 --> 05:00:20,890
I'm sneaking.

5724
05:00:21,790 --> 05:00:22,410
Ha ha ha ha.

5725
05:00:27,520 --> 05:00:28,200
Do you guys hear that?

5726
05:00:29,280 --> 05:00:30,780
Oh, why did it just save?

5727
05:00:31,220 --> 05:00:32,340
Why did it just save?

5728
05:00:33,000 --> 05:00:35,320
The auto save is my worst enemy.

5729
05:00:44,310 --> 05:00:45,230
Organic tr...

5730
05:00:45,230 --> 05:00:45,510
Oh, dang.

5731
05:00:45,510 --> 05:00:46,050
I thought this...

5732
05:00:46,050 --> 05:00:46,290
Oh, wait.

5733
05:00:46,370 --> 05:00:47,070
I can eat it.

5734
05:00:48,230 --> 05:00:49,030
Oh, never mind.

5735
05:00:49,230 --> 05:00:49,890
We don't like that.

5736
05:00:50,390 --> 05:00:51,110
Ha ha ha ha.

5737
05:00:52,850 --> 05:00:53,250
Um.

5738
05:00:53,630 --> 05:00:54,930
I guess we could...

5739
05:00:54,930 --> 05:00:56,150
Grab these to...

5740
05:00:56,150 --> 05:00:56,590
Get out.

5741
05:01:03,660 --> 05:01:05,180
We could just stack it, maybe.

5742
05:01:07,480 --> 05:01:08,280
Eating trash.

5743
05:01:09,520 --> 05:01:10,480
I did that, yeah.

5744
05:01:11,040 --> 05:01:12,240
Ha ha ha ha.

5745
05:01:14,020 --> 05:01:14,540
Shovel?

5746
05:01:17,340 --> 05:01:18,700
Where do you see a shovel at?

5747
05:01:21,360 --> 05:01:22,960
You guys have such good eyes.

5748
05:01:23,300 --> 05:01:24,640
Oh, I see it.

5749
05:01:26,900 --> 05:01:27,420
Oh.

5750
05:01:31,680 --> 05:01:32,560
Let me out.

5751
05:01:33,400 --> 05:01:34,400
Let me out.

5752
05:01:34,540 --> 05:01:35,440
Look inside the tree.

5753
05:01:35,700 --> 05:01:36,080
What, this one?

5754
05:01:37,620 --> 05:01:38,140
Oh.

5755
05:01:49,300 --> 05:01:50,020
More trash.

5756
05:01:55,140 --> 05:01:55,500
Spooky.

5757
05:01:57,200 --> 05:01:57,560
Wait.

5758
05:01:57,780 --> 05:01:58,240
No kidding?

5759
05:01:58,420 --> 05:01:59,420
We're gonna get a Wendigo?

5760
05:02:01,680 --> 05:02:02,040
Oh.

5761
05:02:02,220 --> 05:02:02,800
That's freaky.

5762
05:02:05,400 --> 05:02:05,760
Wait.

5763
05:02:05,820 --> 05:02:07,340
How do I actually get out of here, though?

5764
05:02:07,640 --> 05:02:08,220
Ha ha ha ha.

5765
05:02:11,250 --> 05:02:12,810
How actually do I get out of here?

5766
05:02:20,450 --> 05:02:21,430
Wait, hold on.

5767
05:02:21,650 --> 05:02:21,830
E.

5768
05:02:22,090 --> 05:02:22,530
Push.

5769
05:02:23,010 --> 05:02:23,370
Oops.

5770
05:02:24,850 --> 05:02:25,810
Collect the head first.

5771
05:02:26,450 --> 05:02:26,790
Okay.

5772
05:02:28,250 --> 05:02:28,770
Oh.

5773
05:02:31,680 --> 05:02:32,200
Uh.

5774
05:02:34,860 --> 05:02:35,700
Did it...

5775
05:02:35,700 --> 05:02:36,060
No clip?

5776
05:02:36,740 --> 05:02:37,180
Um.

5777
05:02:38,240 --> 05:02:38,380
Ha.

5778
05:02:41,000 --> 05:02:42,040
Oh, I moved it?

5779
05:02:42,220 --> 05:02:42,580
Did I?

5780
05:02:42,700 --> 05:02:43,140
Oh, okay.

5781
05:02:43,560 --> 05:02:44,620
I was about to...

5782
05:02:46,080 --> 05:02:47,740
I was about to be like...

5783
05:02:47,740 --> 05:02:47,920
Oh.

5784
05:02:47,920 --> 05:02:48,480
Uh...

5785
05:02:48,480 --> 05:02:49,500
I think I...

5786
05:02:49,500 --> 05:02:49,900
Nope.

5787
05:02:50,060 --> 05:02:50,660
I can't collect.

5788
05:02:50,840 --> 05:02:51,100
There we go.

5789
05:02:51,180 --> 05:02:51,400
Crap.

5790
05:03:00,570 --> 05:03:01,390
Oh my god.

5791
05:03:01,610 --> 05:03:02,130
Oh my god.

5792
05:03:10,200 --> 05:03:11,900
Why doesn't it feel like I'm...

5793
05:03:11,900 --> 05:03:13,840
Why does it feel like I'm not any taller at all?

5794
05:03:16,060 --> 05:03:16,500
Hoofprints?

5795
05:03:17,400 --> 05:03:17,840
Where?

5796
05:03:29,100 --> 05:03:29,960
That's freaky.

5797
05:03:31,820 --> 05:03:32,620
That's freaky.

5798
05:03:38,670 --> 05:03:39,790
Um.

5799
05:03:44,180 --> 05:03:44,360
Um.

5800
05:03:47,370 --> 05:03:49,670
You can make the jump from the dresser?

5801
05:03:51,290 --> 05:03:52,410
Wait.

5802
05:03:55,370 --> 05:03:56,450
From here?

5803
05:04:03,030 --> 05:04:03,830
Up.

5804
05:04:06,210 --> 05:04:06,770
Uh.

5805
05:04:08,410 --> 05:04:09,150
Up.

5806
05:04:09,810 --> 05:04:10,930
Oh, I did it.

5807
05:04:11,490 --> 05:04:11,930
Let's go.

5808
05:04:21,480 --> 05:04:22,600
Is he here?

5809
05:04:28,230 --> 05:04:34,330
Yeah, there's a bit of an attic, but I don't know how to... National Park.

5810
05:04:36,470 --> 05:04:37,590
He might be.

5811
05:04:38,490 --> 05:04:40,190
He's just chilling somewhere.

5812
05:04:41,630 --> 05:04:43,330
Make a run for it.

5813
05:04:44,010 --> 05:04:45,950
Okay, but what about my ATV?

5814
05:04:57,850 --> 05:04:58,790
Leave it?

5815
05:04:58,950 --> 05:04:59,130
Okay.

5816
05:05:01,410 --> 05:05:02,030
Oops.

5817
05:05:02,770 --> 05:05:03,710
What was that?

5818
05:05:04,450 --> 05:05:05,250
Was that him?

5819
05:05:05,590 --> 05:05:07,270
It was, like, kind of orange for a second.

5820
05:05:07,550 --> 05:05:10,990
Unless that was my vision going... kind of funky.

5821
05:05:21,360 --> 05:05:23,300
Luckily, we're close to home.

5822
05:05:24,620 --> 05:05:26,660
Oh my gosh, my old blood stains.

5823
05:05:30,920 --> 05:05:32,080
Josh, welcome to membership.

5824
05:05:35,320 --> 05:05:38,320
So we have to put the skull in the microwave.

5825
05:05:39,440 --> 05:05:41,160
That's what we do?

5826
05:05:47,300 --> 05:05:49,380
Set it to 60 seconds.

5827
05:05:54,470 --> 05:05:55,010
Okay.

5828
05:05:57,350 --> 05:05:58,430
Actual.

5829
05:05:59,050 --> 05:06:00,070
Apparently.

5830
05:06:00,350 --> 05:06:01,430
Apparently...

5831
05:06:01,430 --> 05:06:03,510
That's...

5832
05:06:03,510 --> 05:06:06,030
What we have to do.

5833
05:06:06,550 --> 05:06:07,730
Am I confused?

5834
05:06:08,210 --> 05:06:09,090
Yes.

5835
05:06:09,470 --> 05:06:10,250
Am I intrigued?

5836
05:06:11,570 --> 05:06:12,650
Absolutely.

5837
05:06:14,150 --> 05:06:15,590
Manual save.

5838
05:06:27,590 --> 05:06:28,850
How do I put it in there?

5839
05:06:31,210 --> 05:06:31,750
Oops.

5840
05:06:33,950 --> 05:06:34,490
Oopsie.

5841
05:06:38,250 --> 05:06:40,370
Ah, my stomach is growling even.

5842
05:06:46,380 --> 05:06:47,620
How do I use it?

5843
05:06:49,700 --> 05:06:50,720
I'll plug it in.

5844
05:06:52,160 --> 05:06:53,560
What?

5845
05:06:54,440 --> 05:06:55,200
What?

5846
05:06:55,280 --> 05:06:56,140
Almost has no power, yeah.

5847
05:06:58,560 --> 05:07:00,000
How do I plug it in?

5848
05:07:04,640 --> 05:07:05,340
Uh...

5849
05:07:08,320 --> 05:07:09,720
Uh...

5850
05:07:09,720 --> 05:07:11,460
There's a cord?

5851
05:07:15,640 --> 05:07:16,340
This?

5852
05:07:20,380 --> 05:07:21,080
Crap.

5853
05:07:21,080 --> 05:07:26,520
There we go.

5854
05:07:26,520 --> 05:07:26,600
There we go.

5855
05:07:28,880 --> 05:07:30,040
Okay, easy.

5856
05:07:31,800 --> 05:07:32,900
Easy peasy.

5857
05:07:37,620 --> 05:07:38,280
Uh...

5858
05:07:38,280 --> 05:07:38,900
Uh...

5859
05:07:44,130 --> 05:07:45,410
Oh, I got a...

5860
05:07:45,410 --> 05:07:45,950
Oops.

5861
05:07:57,890 --> 05:07:59,910
I got the achievement...

5862
05:07:59,910 --> 05:08:00,530
Unleashed.

5863
05:08:23,910 --> 05:08:25,010
Will we see him?

5864
05:08:27,650 --> 05:08:29,390
Will we see him from the window?

5865
05:08:33,550 --> 05:08:34,810
Hope you locked up.

5866
05:08:35,110 --> 05:08:36,530
Oh, the radar, we can see it on there.

5867
05:08:39,770 --> 05:08:41,970
That's my... my bike.

5868
05:08:43,970 --> 05:08:45,430
And, uh, that's us.

5869
05:08:48,650 --> 05:08:49,970
Wait, you saw him?

5870
05:08:50,330 --> 05:08:50,890
Where?

5871
05:08:52,150 --> 05:08:52,710
Oh!

5872
05:08:59,660 --> 05:09:00,220
Freaky!

5873
05:09:01,260 --> 05:09:02,560
Did you see it?

5874
05:09:06,150 --> 05:09:08,050
He won't get Maxwell, right?

5875
05:09:08,350 --> 05:09:09,570
I think Maxwell is safe.

5876
05:09:22,450 --> 05:09:24,030
Go to where you saw him?

5877
05:09:30,160 --> 05:09:31,420
Will he appear again?

5878
05:09:32,900 --> 05:09:35,180
I wanna know if he'll, like, open the door.

5879
05:09:35,520 --> 05:09:36,280
You know?

5880
05:09:37,060 --> 05:09:39,080
If he'll, like...

5881
05:09:41,860 --> 05:09:44,900
If he'll, if he'll just walk right in.

5882
05:09:45,240 --> 05:09:46,420
Wait, where'd my shovel go?

5883
05:09:47,440 --> 05:09:48,340
Aw, shoot.

5884
05:09:49,280 --> 05:09:50,680
Yeah, Maxwell's right there!

5885
05:09:51,120 --> 05:09:52,020
He'll be fine.

5886
05:09:57,790 --> 05:09:58,870
Is it in my pocket?

5887
05:09:59,730 --> 05:10:00,550
Oh, good.

5888
05:10:01,750 --> 05:10:03,090
Okay, I feel safe now.

5889
05:10:14,630 --> 05:10:16,050
Is it gonna be a jump scare?

5890
05:10:20,050 --> 05:10:21,030
Ready to bonk.

5891
05:10:21,130 --> 05:10:22,350
Is he gonna, like, run in?

5892
05:10:25,830 --> 05:10:26,630
Safe to shovel.

5893
05:10:29,290 --> 05:10:30,230
How will I know?

5894
05:10:30,970 --> 05:10:32,370
Oh gosh, it just saved.

5895
05:10:38,530 --> 05:10:40,710
You can shovel the trash?

5896
05:10:40,930 --> 05:10:41,050
Really?

5897
05:10:41,630 --> 05:10:41,930
Oh.

5898
05:10:43,010 --> 05:10:46,930
That's not exactly the kind of shoveling I thought that would happen.

5899
05:10:53,150 --> 05:10:53,870
Uh...

5900
05:10:53,870 --> 05:10:54,810
Right click.

5901
05:10:58,590 --> 05:10:59,310
Oh...

5902
05:11:01,960 --> 05:11:04,110
It's turning it from...

5903
05:11:04,110 --> 05:11:05,950
Big trash to...

5904
05:11:05,950 --> 05:11:06,990
Little trash.

5905
05:11:09,010 --> 05:11:10,190
Oh...

5906
05:11:10,190 --> 05:11:10,870
Neat.

5907
05:11:15,180 --> 05:11:17,430
I thought this game was about...

5908
05:11:17,430 --> 05:11:17,910
Aliens.

5909
05:11:29,260 --> 05:11:30,190
He's fine.

5910
05:11:31,100 --> 05:11:32,250
He's right there.

5911
05:11:32,570 --> 05:11:33,770
It's about cleaning.

5912
05:11:36,030 --> 05:11:36,630
Ugh.

5913
05:11:36,790 --> 05:11:37,630
I'm so tired.

5914
05:11:37,810 --> 05:11:38,990
I just want something to happen.

5915
05:11:39,390 --> 05:11:39,970
Please!

5916
05:11:40,770 --> 05:11:42,070
Wendigo, come get me!

5917
05:11:46,010 --> 05:11:50,930
Please, please, please, come to my house.

5918
05:11:53,330 --> 05:11:54,530
Please, please...

5919
05:11:54,530 --> 05:11:55,890
Yeah, we'll go outside and find him.

5920
05:11:56,510 --> 05:11:57,870
Unless he's, like, outside the door.

5921
05:12:06,570 --> 05:12:08,310
Maxwell, I don't want you to see this.

5922
05:12:08,410 --> 05:12:09,070
So turn around.

5923
05:12:10,580 --> 05:12:12,290
When mommy dies...

5924
05:12:13,590 --> 05:12:14,930
It won't be pretty.

5925
05:12:15,710 --> 05:12:16,950
He was right here.

5926
05:12:16,950 --> 05:12:17,850
Why did he leave?

5927
05:12:21,590 --> 05:12:22,890
He was right here.

5928
05:12:22,890 --> 05:12:23,790
Where did he go?

5929
05:12:26,390 --> 05:12:27,390
Where did he...

5930
05:12:27,390 --> 05:12:28,270
Wendigo?

5931
05:12:34,510 --> 05:12:35,270
Uh...

5932
05:12:35,270 --> 05:12:37,110
Oh, he left some bones.

5933
05:12:37,910 --> 05:12:39,150
Aw, El.

5934
05:12:46,600 --> 05:12:47,760
I'm hungry.

5935
05:12:51,030 --> 05:12:53,670
He says, El Bozo, summon the demon.

5936
05:12:59,130 --> 05:13:00,870
He was right here.

5937
05:13:03,270 --> 05:13:04,930
He'll come back at night.

5938
05:13:06,950 --> 05:13:07,450
Will he?

5939
05:13:08,990 --> 05:13:10,250
I'll go to sleep.

5940
05:13:40,530 --> 05:13:42,770
I should wake up in the middle of the night, I think.

5941
05:13:47,070 --> 05:13:47,510
Probably?

5942
05:13:55,500 --> 05:13:56,720
Events should wake you.

5943
05:13:57,000 --> 05:13:57,580
Oh, okay, good.

5944
05:13:58,560 --> 05:13:59,340
I saved again.

5945
05:14:00,380 --> 05:14:02,280
The autosave is kinda...

5946
05:14:03,480 --> 05:14:04,340
Kinda evil.

5947
05:14:04,460 --> 05:14:05,260
Whoa, we got a dream!

5948
05:14:06,000 --> 05:14:06,200
Whoa!

5949
05:14:08,060 --> 05:14:08,240
Oh.

5950
05:14:12,590 --> 05:14:14,650
Do I have my...

5951
05:14:14,650 --> 05:14:15,990
My shovel?

5952
05:14:20,800 --> 05:14:22,240
He woke me up.

5953
05:14:23,820 --> 05:14:24,960
Is he in my home?

5954
05:14:37,510 --> 05:14:38,130
Um...

5955
05:14:38,130 --> 05:14:39,330
What was this one?

5956
05:14:48,760 --> 05:14:49,380
Wendigo!

5957
05:14:50,180 --> 05:14:51,900
Oh my gosh, I thought that was him.

5958
05:14:52,540 --> 05:14:53,160
Wendigo!

5959
05:14:54,700 --> 05:14:55,140
Wendigo!

5960
05:14:55,140 --> 05:14:55,920
I summon thee!

5961
05:14:56,960 --> 05:14:57,580
Maxwell's fine.

5962
05:14:57,600 --> 05:14:58,200
He's right there.

5963
05:15:02,480 --> 05:15:02,920
Wendigo!

5964
05:15:03,240 --> 05:15:05,240
Why is my vision, like, kind of slanted?

5965
05:15:05,360 --> 05:15:05,820
Do you see that?

5966
05:15:08,900 --> 05:15:09,740
Do you see that?

5967
05:15:09,940 --> 05:15:11,200
It's kinda like...

5968
05:15:22,080 --> 05:15:22,740
I'm fine.

5969
05:15:27,440 --> 05:15:28,580
Maxwell, don't look.

5970
05:15:29,860 --> 05:15:30,500
Wendigo!

5971
05:15:30,880 --> 05:15:32,220
Wait, it's still like...

5972
05:15:32,220 --> 05:15:32,620
bright out.

5973
05:15:35,020 --> 05:15:36,240
Will I hear him?

5974
05:15:44,670 --> 05:15:45,810
Why did you leave?

5975
05:15:50,270 --> 05:15:51,650
He woke me up.

5976
05:15:52,250 --> 05:15:53,130
First, he...

5977
05:15:53,130 --> 05:15:53,790
came to my home.

5978
05:15:54,290 --> 05:15:55,470
Did not come inside.

5979
05:15:58,290 --> 05:15:58,930
Left...

5980
05:15:58,930 --> 05:16:00,710
Walk me up out of a sleep.

5981
05:16:01,230 --> 05:16:02,050
Left again.

5982
05:16:04,990 --> 05:16:06,370
Oh, it's a random nightmare.

5983
05:16:06,710 --> 05:16:07,050
No...

5984
05:16:07,050 --> 05:16:07,770
No way.

5985
05:16:09,390 --> 05:16:11,170
I don't think that's a random nightmare.

5986
05:16:11,330 --> 05:16:12,090
Looked just like him.

5987
05:16:16,750 --> 05:16:18,590
Maxwell, I'm going for a walk.

5988
05:16:19,310 --> 05:16:19,650
Don't...

5989
05:16:19,650 --> 05:16:20,650
Don't come for...

5990
05:16:20,650 --> 05:16:21,830
Don't come looking for me.

5991
05:16:36,290 --> 05:16:37,850
Go get your ATV.

5992
05:16:38,550 --> 05:16:39,610
So true.

5993
05:16:43,810 --> 05:16:44,590
Please, Wendigo.

5994
05:16:44,750 --> 05:16:45,770
I want to end stream.

5995
05:16:49,090 --> 05:16:50,570
Please, Wendigo.

5996
05:16:50,770 --> 05:16:52,210
I want to Wendigo to bed.

5997
05:17:09,260 --> 05:17:09,940
Wendigo.

5998
05:17:11,840 --> 05:17:12,300
Wendigo.

5999
05:17:12,300 --> 05:17:13,700
Oh, that's my tummy growling.

6000
05:17:13,860 --> 05:17:14,950
Where did you Wendigo?

6001
05:17:16,400 --> 05:17:17,940
As soon as I put away my...

6002
05:17:19,140 --> 05:17:19,600
Um...

6003
05:17:19,600 --> 05:17:20,120
My shovel.

6004
05:17:20,260 --> 05:17:21,920
I know this bastard is going to come out.

6005
05:17:22,020 --> 05:17:23,000
And be like...

6006
05:17:23,000 --> 05:17:24,240
Haha, you are...

6007
05:17:24,840 --> 05:17:25,300
You...

6008
05:17:25,920 --> 05:17:26,380
You...

6009
05:17:29,240 --> 05:17:30,160
You are...

6010
05:17:31,840 --> 05:17:32,300
Uh...

6011
05:17:33,100 --> 05:17:33,560
Unarmed.

6012
05:17:37,500 --> 05:17:39,020
This game is a slow burn...

6013
05:17:39,020 --> 05:17:40,060
Including the spookies.

6014
05:17:40,600 --> 05:17:42,300
Yeah, but I summoned the big baddie.

6015
05:17:43,020 --> 05:17:43,740
And everyone...

6016
05:17:43,740 --> 05:17:44,760
Everyone was just like...

6017
05:17:44,760 --> 05:17:45,760
Oh, she's going to die now.

6018
05:17:45,760 --> 05:17:46,240
For real.

6019
05:17:46,920 --> 05:17:47,580
Oh, yeah.

6020
05:17:47,980 --> 05:17:48,580
It's coming.

6021
05:17:49,100 --> 05:17:50,860
I made it sound like it would happen in two seconds.

6022
05:17:51,660 --> 05:17:52,260
They were like...

6023
05:17:52,260 --> 05:17:52,720
Oh, he's coming.

6024
05:17:54,620 --> 05:17:55,540
Yeah, he is here.

6025
05:17:56,700 --> 05:17:57,480
Where is he?

6026
05:18:04,320 --> 05:18:04,900
Oh, wait.

6027
05:18:05,120 --> 05:18:05,980
Did I go the wrong way?

6028
05:18:06,100 --> 05:18:06,640
I think I did.

6029
05:18:07,520 --> 05:18:08,660
This is my first time seeing this game.

6030
05:18:08,760 --> 05:18:09,760
The amount of details is insane.

6031
05:18:09,860 --> 05:18:10,860
Hope you find your wendigo.

6032
05:18:11,600 --> 05:18:12,800
Oh, he's wendigone.

6033
05:18:13,160 --> 05:18:14,380
He took wendigo...

6034
05:18:14,380 --> 05:18:15,300
Like, literally.

6035
05:18:19,210 --> 05:18:21,170
Aw, this is where we found Maxwell.

6036
05:18:32,830 --> 05:18:33,450
Hey, Builder.

6037
05:18:33,510 --> 05:18:34,950
I know you're trying to help.

6038
05:18:35,090 --> 05:18:36,410
But please stop spamming.

6039
05:18:36,930 --> 05:18:37,970
Please stop spamming.

6040
05:18:42,290 --> 05:18:43,430
Thank you.

6041
05:18:43,430 --> 05:18:43,470
Thank you.

6042
05:18:59,790 --> 05:19:01,850
Why can't this game kill me?

6043
05:19:02,810 --> 05:19:04,930
Maybe I should have stuck to the aliens.

6044
05:19:07,370 --> 05:19:09,410
Maybe I should have stuck to the aliens.

6045
05:19:10,070 --> 05:19:10,230
Maybe I should have stuck to the aliens.

6046
05:19:11,050 --> 05:19:13,170
They wouldn't have done me wrong.

6047
05:19:17,020 --> 05:19:17,660
Probably.

6048
05:19:18,380 --> 05:19:21,340
Rogot summoned, noped, and started a cryptid YouTube channel.

6049
05:19:27,560 --> 05:19:29,480
Guys, I think I'm just gonna call it.

6050
05:19:32,600 --> 05:19:33,620
Wendigone for milk.

6051
05:19:36,020 --> 05:19:38,900
Oh, I thought the place was on fire for a second.

6052
05:19:40,560 --> 05:19:42,140
I was about to be like, yo!

6053
05:19:51,660 --> 05:19:52,760
Oh, I'm stuck.

6054
05:19:53,120 --> 05:19:54,500
Oh, I'm on break mode.

6055
05:19:59,930 --> 05:20:00,370
Oop.

6056
05:20:00,770 --> 05:20:01,850
This is really fun though.

6057
05:20:01,970 --> 05:20:02,910
This game was really fun.

6058
05:20:06,290 --> 05:20:08,190
Like I said, I don't mind a slow burn.

6059
05:20:10,190 --> 05:20:10,830
But...

6060
05:20:13,710 --> 05:20:15,930
But, I wanted to see the Wendigo.

6061
05:20:18,150 --> 05:20:19,770
We kinda saw him.

6062
05:20:20,070 --> 05:20:21,410
We kind of saw him.

6063
05:20:21,750 --> 05:20:22,810
We saw...

6064
05:20:22,810 --> 05:20:25,410
Maybe zero aliens.

6065
05:20:25,770 --> 05:20:27,530
I didn't do my job at all.

6066
05:20:28,630 --> 05:20:30,970
I got paid once.

6067
05:20:31,370 --> 05:20:33,350
And they said it was a bad job.

6068
05:20:33,870 --> 05:20:35,370
And then...

6069
05:20:36,070 --> 05:20:39,530
All I've been eating is like rotten food from around the base.

6070
05:20:44,080 --> 05:20:44,520
I...

6071
05:20:44,520 --> 05:20:45,680
I just haven't done...

6072
05:20:45,680 --> 05:20:47,320
Oh yeah, we cleaned up a little bit.

6073
05:20:47,560 --> 05:20:50,180
I'm too afraid to go into the incinerator room though.

6074
05:20:51,160 --> 05:20:53,820
You found out the books you read and read in fear.

6075
05:20:55,240 --> 05:20:56,940
He's like, that won't happen to me.

6076
05:20:57,120 --> 05:20:58,620
I'm not gonna be part of your...

6077
05:20:58,620 --> 05:21:00,200
Your fan fiction.

6078
05:21:00,660 --> 05:21:01,480
Little lady.

6079
05:21:12,470 --> 05:21:14,250
Oh, I just thought of...

6080
05:21:14,250 --> 05:21:15,010
Ugh, never mind.

6081
05:21:16,190 --> 05:21:17,130
Uh, how about...

6082
05:21:17,130 --> 05:21:17,730
Which way is home?

6083
05:21:18,050 --> 05:21:18,770
Is this home?

6084
05:21:19,930 --> 05:21:20,730
Yes.

6085
05:21:22,890 --> 05:21:24,630
I ran over a rock.

6086
05:21:27,910 --> 05:21:28,310
Okay.

6087
05:21:31,890 --> 05:21:33,510
I'm gonna call it here.

6088
05:21:33,790 --> 05:21:34,570
Folks.

6089
05:21:43,330 --> 05:21:44,610
Get Maxwell.

6090
05:21:44,610 --> 05:21:45,070
Well...

6091
05:21:46,550 --> 05:21:48,030
Yeah, I'll bring him inside.

6092
05:21:49,250 --> 05:21:50,090
Oh, it spooked me.

6093
05:21:50,290 --> 05:21:51,050
Try Princess.

6094
05:21:51,270 --> 05:21:51,670
Thank you.

6095
05:22:01,250 --> 05:22:02,570
We'll put him on my desk.

6096
05:22:20,890 --> 05:22:21,950
There we go!

6097
05:22:24,210 --> 05:22:24,770
Yay!

6098
05:22:24,770 --> 05:22:24,930
Yay!

6099
05:22:26,290 --> 05:22:26,690
Um...

6100
05:22:26,690 --> 05:22:27,150
It kinda...

6101
05:22:27,150 --> 05:22:28,870
Actually, I just noticed the way that I like...

6102
05:22:28,870 --> 05:22:29,230
Cleaned this.

6103
05:22:29,330 --> 05:22:30,930
It looks like the silhouette of a person.

6104
05:22:31,130 --> 05:22:33,110
And it ended up scaring me.

6105
05:22:33,410 --> 05:22:34,950
When I came inside.

6106
05:22:39,010 --> 05:22:40,170
It ended up...

6107
05:22:40,170 --> 05:22:40,910
It ended up freaking me out.

6108
05:22:42,310 --> 05:22:44,550
Yeah, we got Maxwell like crazy fast.

6109
05:22:46,930 --> 05:22:48,270
But that was fun.

6110
05:22:48,330 --> 05:22:50,430
Thank you guys for Voices of the Void.

6111
05:22:50,530 --> 05:22:53,350
Thank you for helping me out with all the confusions...

6112
05:22:53,350 --> 05:22:53,830
Confusing.

6113
05:22:54,030 --> 05:22:55,070
Confusing things.

6114
05:22:55,770 --> 05:22:57,590
Because there was so much stuff.

6115
05:23:01,850 --> 05:23:02,610
That's better.

6116
05:23:02,850 --> 05:23:03,530
That's much better.

6117
05:23:05,690 --> 05:23:06,170
Yeah.

6118
05:23:07,150 --> 05:23:08,050
Thank you guys.

6119
05:23:08,190 --> 05:23:08,930
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6120
05:23:09,230 --> 05:23:10,450
Thanks for the stream.

6121
05:23:12,190 --> 05:23:12,670
Um...

6122
05:23:12,670 --> 05:23:14,870
I'll be playing Oblivion on Saturday.

6123
05:23:16,370 --> 05:23:17,950
And I'm sleepy, sleepy.

6124
05:23:18,230 --> 05:23:18,630
So...

6125
05:23:19,590 --> 05:23:21,210
If I see you, then I'll see you.

6126
05:23:21,230 --> 05:23:22,870
And if I don't, I'll...

6127
05:23:22,870 --> 05:23:23,770
You know.

6128
05:23:24,490 --> 05:23:26,770
If I don't, I'll see you when I see you next.

6129
05:23:27,710 --> 05:23:28,150
Um...

6130
05:23:28,150 --> 05:23:29,030
Do I go take you?

6131
05:23:30,490 --> 05:23:31,590
This is so much fun.

6132
05:23:31,770 --> 05:23:33,830
If anything, it was quite...

6133
05:23:33,830 --> 05:23:37,450
I feel like I was psyching myself out more than anything.

6134
05:23:38,890 --> 05:23:39,330
So...

6135
05:23:40,450 --> 05:23:40,890
Um...

6136
05:23:40,890 --> 05:23:41,190
Yeah.

6137
05:23:41,610 --> 05:23:42,770
But uh...

6138
05:23:43,450 --> 05:23:44,310
Atumito everybody!

6139
05:23:45,170 --> 05:23:46,090
Have a good day.

6140
05:23:46,210 --> 05:23:47,190
Thank you so much for watching.

6141
05:23:47,390 --> 05:23:48,650
Thanks for hanging out.

6142
05:23:49,110 --> 05:23:49,530
Save.

6143
05:23:49,830 --> 05:23:50,870
Oh yeah, we should save.

6144
05:23:53,770 --> 05:23:54,590
There we go.

6145
05:23:57,010 --> 05:23:57,930
Again...

6146
05:23:57,930 --> 05:23:59,530
I think my...

6147
05:23:59,530 --> 05:24:01,950
Generators are about to...

6148
05:24:03,670 --> 05:24:05,110
About to go out.

6149
05:24:06,410 --> 05:24:08,810
That's for future Minto's problem.

6150
05:24:11,610 --> 05:24:12,870
What was that?

6151
05:24:26,240 --> 05:24:27,140
What was that?

6152
05:24:27,780 --> 05:24:29,080
The game is not paused?

6153
05:24:30,060 --> 05:24:31,140
But it said paused.

6154
05:24:31,140 --> 05:24:31,380
But it said paused.

6155
05:24:36,700 --> 05:24:37,800
Save is grayed out.

6156
05:24:37,900 --> 05:24:38,740
Wait, what's going on?

6157
05:24:46,460 --> 05:24:47,580
It was glitching.

6158
05:24:47,760 --> 05:24:48,380
Oh yeah, yeah.

6159
05:24:51,900 --> 05:24:53,300
Future Minto's problem.

6160
05:24:54,480 --> 05:24:54,940
Yeah!

6161
05:24:55,340 --> 05:24:56,080
Wait, what's the radar?

6162
05:25:00,140 --> 05:25:01,100
We are...

6163
05:25:04,640 --> 05:25:05,740
We are...

6164
05:25:05,740 --> 05:25:09,040
We have reached unmatched levels of...

6165
05:25:09,040 --> 05:25:09,740
Creatures.

6166
05:25:15,190 --> 05:25:16,610
Maxwell gives me courage.

6167
05:25:19,050 --> 05:25:22,070
If anything happens to him, I'll become John Wick.

6168
05:25:23,830 --> 05:25:24,790
Okay.

6169
05:25:25,470 --> 05:25:26,270
Oh, it's gone.

6170
05:25:26,450 --> 05:25:27,190
It's all good now.

6171
05:25:27,830 --> 05:25:28,470
Otabito, everybody!

6172
05:25:28,850 --> 05:25:29,650
Thank you, thank you!

6173
05:25:30,230 --> 05:25:31,230
Have a good day, have a good night.

6174
05:25:31,490 --> 05:25:32,110
See you later.

6175
05:25:32,350 --> 05:25:32,910
Bye-bye!

6176
05:25:33,070 --> 05:25:33,710
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

6177
05:25:33,830 --> 05:25:34,790
Thank you so much for the stream.

6178
05:25:35,490 --> 05:25:36,130
Bye-bye!

6179
05:25:36,590 --> 05:25:36,970
Bye-bye!

6180
05:25:36,970 --> 05:25:37,130
Bye-bye!

6181
05:25:37,130 --> 05:25:37,670
Bye-bye!
