1
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,620
Yay!

2
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,130
Oh, and...

3
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,970
Why do you laugh?

4
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:39,710
Why do you laugh?

5
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,530
Why are you laughing?

6
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,350
You're such a larper!

7
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,450
I'm an actual maid, what are you talking about?

8
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,510
Oh wait, oh shit, shit, shit, sorry, I didn't hear you.

9
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,970
I forgot to reroute you in the...

10
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,490
Oh my god.

11
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:01,850
Oh, but I thought I could keep you separate from the game audio, but I won't be able to.

12
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,470
I think, okay, I'm gonna help you with your settings.

13
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,030
Yeah, no, no, no, I know I can do two desktop audios, yeah!

14
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,810
No, you don't need two desktop audios!

15
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,650
Oh, I guess I could do game audio, right?

16
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,250
Maybe.

17
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,090
I did!

18
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:25,270
So I have streaming on 3.4, and then I have Discord voice on 5.6.

19
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,290
What the fuck are you talking about?

20
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,710
What do you mean?

21
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,130
What do you mean?

22
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,550
But what do you mean you have streaming on 3.4?

23
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,830
Streaming is its own channel.

24
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:39,630
I know!

25
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,290
I have it on 3.4 so that they can hear my desktop.

26
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,530
And then I... Oh wait, I forgot to turn that on.

27
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,470
And then I have you on 5.6.

28
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:59,590
Okay, well, I don't know what... The moment I switched scenes my brain turned off.

29
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,730
I used to be smarter.

30
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,350
I used to be taller.

31
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,710
I used to be a baller.

32
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,670
Why are you so obsessed with Erin?

33
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:14,150
I was really just thinking, man, I wish I was taller.

34
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,930
And then I played the song like 20 times.

35
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,230
And listened to it now forever.

36
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,310
What is that song?

37
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,490
Yeah, what is that?

38
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,470
The baller of all balls doesn't know the song?

39
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,430
What is that?

40
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,930
You were quite sophisticated with your knowledge in songs.

41
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,210
I don't...

42
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:36,650
I thought.

43
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,910
Maybe not.

44
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,530
All I know... I'm a weeaboo.

45
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,190
All I know is Japanese songs.

46
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,150
But no!

47
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,570
You know all these songs that are, you know, important and cultural.

48
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,950
Do you know... Okay, so here it goes.

49
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,750
It's a rap song.

50
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,070
It goes like...

51
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,390
I wish I was taller.

52
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,810
I wish I was a baller.

53
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,650
I wish I had a girl that was...

54
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,870
What was she?

55
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,130
Cute?

56
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,590
I don't know.

57
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,110
I wish I had a girl...

58
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,910
It's not in a minute.

59
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,330
No, I wish I had a girl that was, whatever, cute for example.

60
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,650
She's rewriting history, guys.

61
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,150
This is new lyrics.

62
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,810
Ah, there it is.

63
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,310
I wish I was...

64
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,370
I wish I was taller.

65
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,170
I wish I was a baller.

66
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,090
I wish I had a girl who would look good.

67
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,090
I would call her...

68
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,370
I wish I had a rabbit with a hat.

69
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:42,910
No!

70
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,260
I wish I had a rabbit with a hat and...

71
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,210
Someone should put this over the karaoke.

72
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,990
No, it's pretty accurate.

73
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,030
I wish I was... I wish I was a little bit taller.

74
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,250
I wish I was a baller.

75
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,830
I wish I had a girl who looked good.

76
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,750
I would call her...

77
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,270
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat and a six-form baller.

78
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,610
What does that mean?

79
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,470
Doesn't that... That goes hard!

80
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,350
It's good!

81
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,190
It's really... How do you not know?

82
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,090
I don't know.

83
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,450
Wait, it's an old song?

84
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,750
It's from like 1995?

85
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,290
Yeah, so what?

86
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,830
Don't you know any other songs from before you were born?

87
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,030
I mean, you?

88
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,190
I'm just saying, it's pretty old.

89
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,170
Grandma music over here.

90
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,330
Surely, you know...

91
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,210
Like, what about... I don't know.

92
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,850
What else is from 1995?

93
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,450
Like, surely there's Michael Jackson songs that you know that are from that time.

94
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,550
Or Elvis or Beatles.

95
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,230
Elvis from 1995.

96
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,410
Is that unrealistic?

97
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,020
Don't just laugh at me!

98
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,900
Don't just laugh at me!

99
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,040
You guys, she's a phoenix.

100
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,360
She doesn't think about any concept of time.

101
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,800
It's confusing.

102
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,600
Okay, maybe he's from like the 70s or... What?

103
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,240
80s?

104
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,240
I think he died in the 70s.

105
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,840
Well, he was probably in his prime, was he not?

106
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,040
He didn't get very old, did he?

107
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,260
He... I wouldn't say prime.

108
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,020
He was... But I think like the 60s was like his prime, right?

109
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,100
50s?

110
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,180
60s?

111
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,600
What are we talking about?

112
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,680
I'm already feeling hot, girl.

113
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,640
Put on some clothes.

114
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,180
I don't know what you're wearing right now, but...

115
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,540
Says you.

116
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,120
I have a dress on.

117
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,120
You have nothing.

118
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,400
You have a logo on your body.

119
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,020
I have a logo on my body?

120
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,860
In the thumbnail.

121
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,600
It's just the logo.

122
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,620
Oh, I thought my boogie tag had a logo on it.

123
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,400
No, you're sitting in my lap.

124
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,480
The logo on my body is just so people would panic less.

125
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

126
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,840
The picture itself is not that... You know, there's nothing to hide.

127
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,100
Right.

128
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,400
I've got nothing to hide.

129
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:47,340
I'm surprised you weren't... that you didn't like jump on to that art first for your thumbnail.

130
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,120
Did you forget about it already?

131
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,100
I don't think of the spicy thumbnails.

132
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,320
What?!

133
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,680
That's your brain.

134
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,700
No, okay.

135
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,680
Maybe you don't make your thumbnails spicy, but...

136
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,360
M'lady.

137
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,300
No frill, m'lady.

138
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,680
No back of dress, m'lady.

139
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,960
You gave the meaning of a backless dress a new meaning.

140
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,820
A new meaning?

141
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,220
When are we getting the Kiwawa version?

142
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,280
It's difficult.

143
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,760
I think that's a thing only indies can do.

144
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,740
I can't really...

145
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,280
You have your workout outfit.

146
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,840
I think that's...

147
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,900
The KFP don't need... They will have blood loss and they won't be able to work.

148
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:46,820
I mean, I have my... I can get my 3D model pretty naked, but my 2D model I cannot get naked at all.

149
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,560
What do you mean you can get your 3D model pretty naked?

150
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,580
So you could do it in 3D!

151
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,980
Yeah, which would be worse.

152
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,840
Just don't turn around!

153
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,460
Very difficult.

154
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,800
Even for you in 2D it was already risky.

155
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,480
No, I checked.

156
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,120
It was fine.

157
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,480
Well, next time I hope you can upgrade the dress to a...

158
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,540
Or maybe not!

159
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,580
Or... Oh!

160
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,540
How about...

161
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,040
You use the same dress, but you wear it on your back.

162
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,690
So it's... Wait, so I turn around or...

163
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,800
No, no.

164
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,700
You pin it to your back.

165
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,320
You cover your back side, but you don't cover your front side.

166
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:47,480
That's a genius, because then people could just take the front version and then the back version and kind of sandwich them.

167
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,960
And then it looks like I'm wearing a normal dress.

168
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:56,120
Yeah, but then you would first have to provide them with your frontal view.

169
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,150
Are you okay?

170
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:14,270
I'm saying, you're not showing them the back side, because you don't have a real back side.

171
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:14,910
What?

172
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,230
Are you saying I'm a flat ass?

173
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,610
You are...

174
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,770
One-dimensional!

175
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,630
Oh yeah, that's true.

176
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,150
Wait, that is true.

177
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,910
Wait, no, I'm two-dimensional.

178
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,270
But it feels like you're one-dimensional.

179
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:34,850
What?

180
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,930
It's like telling a cat, do you know you're a cat?

181
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,430
What?

182
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,630
What?

183
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,310
What are you saying?

184
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,430
What are you saying?

185
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,230
Meow?

186
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,250
I think cats don't think much.

187
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,150
Can I say a joke?

188
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:50,750
Okay.

189
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,330
That I came up with?

190
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,190
Yeah.

191
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,750
It's a joke only we VTubers can use.

192
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,030
Okay.

193
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,110
And I already used it.

194
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,110
So the other day I had a meet-and-greet.

195
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,630
And at the end of the meet-and-greet, you know, we always take a picture.

196
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,850
And so...

197
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,130
What is this excitement?

198
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,690
So the person was standing right by the monitor, and we were taking a picture.

199
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,050
And I was saying, get my good side!

200
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,870
Oh well, I only have one.

201
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:42,890
I

202
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,790
think I need to switch it to a T-shirt, I'm so sweaty.

203
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,890
You weren't getting that sweaty?

204
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,070
I have tears in my eyes.

205
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,570
Talk more!

206
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:13,230
Okay.

207
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,320
I can't hear you, I think you're being like, Discord cancelled.

208
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,930
Oh, wait, seriously?

209
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,070
I'm laughing at your joke.

210
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,070
Oh my god, oh my god.

211
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,790
Well, actually I was laughing at how hard you were laughing at your joke.

212
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:38,130
When you start laughing so hard, and then you start laughing at your laughing, because you don't understand why you were just endlessly laughing.

213
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:38,790
I know.

214
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,410
I get into that mood too, yeah.

215
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,670
Did you take off your shirt yet?

216
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,070
No, yeah, there's nothing underneath.

217
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,110
Can you introduce yourself to the audience while I go get a shirt?

218
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,490
Okay.

219
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,990
Hello everybody, my name is Midphantom.

220
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,150
I'm a ghost-made VTuber.

221
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,330
Kiara is... she's chatting, she's saying something.

222
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,630
Our comedic genius, Tencho.

223
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,110
Um, yep.

224
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:20,990
For those who didn't understand the backless dress thing, I did a karaoke and I wore a red dress.

225
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,550
And, um, I don't know, people are making a big old deal about it.

226
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,930
Yeah, but, um...

227
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,010
Are you okay?

228
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,950
Are you okay?

229
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,710
Yeah.

230
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,430
Yeah.

231
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,510
I think I am.

232
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,910
Oh, it smells like fresh laundry.

233
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,710
Ooh, nice.

234
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,350
Did you explain to them what we were even talking about?

235
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,770
Yeah, a little bit.

236
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,990
Good, good, good, good.

237
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,890
I just need to calm down.

238
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,930
Deep breaths, deep breaths.

239
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,230
Yeah.

240
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:02,010
Well, well, well, well, my dear child.

241
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:06,130
Today, we are gonna play Age of Empires 2.

242
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:06,750
Woohoo!

243
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,270
Mm-hmm.

244
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,210
And, yeah, so, you know, I had a little bit of an Age of Empires arc.

245
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,470
Was it last year, I think?

246
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,510
Yeah, I heard about this.

247
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,270
Or maybe even before.

248
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,050
Yeah, and I even got a coach, um, and everything.

249
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,750
Really?

250
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,870
And I got like, yeah, I was like on my way to getting good.

251
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,190
It's pretty good, you know.

252
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:28,710
Okay, okay.

253
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:36,830
But, don't worry, I was still like, every time it came to like, starting a battle, initiating a battle, I was crumbling with anxiety.

254
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,930
It's so bad.

255
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,210
The thought of it still makes me nervous.

256
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,070
I just want to forever, like, just build my economy and nothing else.

257
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,090
Oh, you don't want to engage in the battle.

258
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:47,830
You want to just...

259
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,270
Yeah, no.

260
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,330
Become the best of the biggest.

261
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:51,650
Ideally.

262
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,650
But, anyway, so, I was doing that for a while, but it's been a while.

263
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,210
I don't remember much, but I saw you the other day playing.

264
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:11,810
And I normally... I don't really have the time and also, like, the mental space anymore to watch Vtubers for a long amount of time, you know?

265
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,830
Maybe I'll peek into a stream for a few minutes, but that's about it, usually.

266
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,790
But I was watching your stream, like, for hours.

267
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,230
What?

268
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,510
Yeah.

269
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,630
Oh my gosh, do you like me or something?

270
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,350
No!

271
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:28,570
No!

272
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,810
Yeah, maybe.

273
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:40,490
But, like, there's something... I didn't realize this as I was playing it, even though, you know, it's fun playing it too, but...

274
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:46,750
I realized, oh, Age of Empires might be actually extremely chill to watch as a viewer.

275
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,010
Amazing.

276
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,530
But here you are, playing it again.

277
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:58,830
Yeah, so to provide that same joy that I felt watching you once again to others.

278
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,170
She's a woman of the people.

279
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,450
I always am, I always am.

280
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,150
I do what's best for everybody.

281
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,770
So, you know, that's what we're doing today.

282
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:17,110
People shall spectate at our noobness.

283
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,290
Yeah, sorry, we're noobs.

284
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,430
Except you apparently had professional training.

285
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:29,190
No, but, as I said, like, I'm good with maybe building economy, but I already forgot all the key shortcuts, so I do everything with mouse.

286
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,850
Oh, yeah, I did that too.

287
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,430
So don't worry, I won't be that fast.

288
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,430
I feel like we should set the general game speed to slow.

289
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,110
Okay.

290
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,510
So that we have more time.

291
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,330
We gotta get into it, we gotta get warmed up.

292
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,490
Yeah, you know...

293
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,250
Wait, do you remember an important thing?

294
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,150
Yeah, a co-op campaign.

295
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,670
No.

296
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,150
Okay, okay.

297
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:01,910
I've tried Wololoing here and there, but, like, it rarely works out well.

298
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,310
They always, like, get lost and die because they're so small.

299
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:14,110
Is that all you got in terms of Age of Empire memes?

300
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,430
Is that all you got?

301
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:20,330
I have... King of the Losers.

302
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,550
I don't know that.

303
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,070
What?

304
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,850
You don't know the King of the Losers?

305
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,890
I know it's you.

306
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:29,890
Oh, what?

307
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,480
Eleven, eleven.

308
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,560
Eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven.

309
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

310
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,380
Did you try out the cars yet?

311
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,340
Cars?

312
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:48,840
The cars?

313
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,860
Yeah, there's... You can turn on cheat codes for funny...

314
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,940
Oh, no, I didn't.

315
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,300
I forgot last time.

316
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,860
Yeah, you need to play it again.

317
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,500
Go, go, go.

318
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,220
Okay, will do.

319
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:58,880
The cars are funny.

320
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,520
But even the cars didn't bring me to victory that easily.

321
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,680
Anyway, we still haven't started the game.

322
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,460
Wow, surprise.

323
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,020
Because I wanted to ask you guys... Because I want to do a co-op campaign with this girl.

324
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,600
But, guys, do you have a recommended one that's, like, not too difficult that we should play?

325
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,940
Also, I want to switch you back to...

326
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,400
Saladin.

327
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,600
Are you okay?

328
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,560
That was suddenly loud.

329
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,280
Yeah, you were loud.

330
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,660
I was... I was loud?

331
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,400
Yeah.

332
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:36,800
Really?

333
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,140
Did I change volume?

334
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,220
You screamed in my ear.

335
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,380
Oh.

336
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,600
Maybe this game... Against bots?

337
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,520
Yeah, that was the plan.

338
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,240
Against bots.

339
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,060
We might do, like, a versus later.

340
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:52,600
Maybe.

341
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,460
How we're feeling.

342
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:53,820
Maybe.

343
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,380
If you're feeling it.

344
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,200
Atilla... I only saw the first couple, okay?

345
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,780
But they're not sorted like that.

346
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,560
People are saying Atilla is easiest.

347
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,440
Okay, where is... Where is Atilla?

348
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,500
Ah, these ones.

349
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:07,960
Okay.

350
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,260
I wonder if I did any of these already.

351
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,360
Maybe not.

352
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,160
Saladin.

353
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,880
Okay, so we start with the first one.

354
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,880
Scourge of God.

355
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:15,980
Scourge of God.

356
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,280
We're making a room right now.

357
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:17,800
Yeah.

358
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,400
In the lobby.

359
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,320
Yeah.

360
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,060
You got this, girl.

361
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,680
You got this.

362
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,980
You... You have the password.

363
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,880
Oh, yeah, yeah.

364
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,580
I do.

365
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,960
Let me, uh...

366
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,740
Oh, but wait!

367
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,480
Hm?

368
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,900
This is just us.

369
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,800
Let me undo.

370
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,500
Huh?

371
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,560
Wait, what?

372
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,060
I... I need to make a new one.

373
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,200
Because I think in the create lobby screen... Yeah, you can choose how many players.

374
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

375
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,560
And I only had two.

376
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,660
Should we do four or so?

377
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,960
Why would we do more?

378
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,760
If it's just us.

379
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,900
No, because, like, we wanna be together, right?

380
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,880
But there's... There has to be some enemy.

381
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,160
We can't just be friends.

382
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,500
Oh, right, right, right.

383
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,620
Oh, right, right, right.

384
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:02,580
Oh!

385
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:02,800
Yeah.

386
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,260
Is the campaign not a story?

387
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,300
Actually, I'm confused.

388
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,520
I... I don't know.

389
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,880
Do we need... Do we... Do I need to account for an enemy NPC?

390
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,040
Yeah.

391
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:15,960
Wait.

392
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,780
I guess so, because story mode... They have already...

393
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,320
Oh, people are saying not in campaign.

394
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,900
Campaign has AI by default.

395
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,940
In the campaign, you just do co-op.

396
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,620
Okay, so I just choose two players.

397
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,660
Okay, okay, okay.

398
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:32,900
Okay, okay, okay.

400
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,100
Okay, the lobby is open again.

401
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,640
Same password.

402
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,080
But why am I the Huns?

403
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,920
Am I supposed to be the Huns?

404
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,080
How do I find your lobby?

405
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,100
Search lobby.

406
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,660
So now I will show...

407
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:52,780
Oh!

408
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,660
Do you need my game ID?

409
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,120
I think so.

410
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,340
Okay.

411
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,240
So this is super safe.

412
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,700
What the heck is that?

413
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,560
Oh my god.

414
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,860
It's like you're sending me your IP address.

415
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,480
It's after the slash.

416
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,420
The last slash.

417
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,240
That's where it starts.

418
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,860
Okay, okay.

419
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:10,900
Searching.

420
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,740
Send her an invite.

421
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:12,820
Searching.

422
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,000
Searching for games.

423
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:15,940
How do I find it?

424
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,260
Are we friends in Steam?

425
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,580
Oh, I don't know actually.

426
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,380
You went to multiplayer, right?

427
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,760
And then made the lobby.

428
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,740
So find custom game.

429
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,680
Yeah.

430
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,540
Okay, we gotta be Steam friends.

431
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,780
Maybe that will make it easier.

432
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,280
Maybe.

433
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,180
Okay.

434
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,760
Starting from scratch.

435
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,980
But I will give you my friend code.

436
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,340
Too late.

437
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,120
I already sent it.

438
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,420
No!

439
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,320
No!

440
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,180
I don't remember how to add friends.

441
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,140
I don't remember how to add friends.

442
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,200
Guys, look at all these lobbies.

443
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,360
They're full of noobs.

444
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,360
Noob, noob, noob, noob, noob.

445
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,900
They will be joined by more noobs soon.

446
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,280
How do I add friend?

447
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
How do I add friend?

448
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,360
Okay woman, just give me your Steam account.

449
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,360
Where do I find...

450
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:31,640
Go to your name and then friends on Steam.

451
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,180
Yeah, I could probably send you one now.

452
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,080
I sent one.

453
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,860
Okay, add a friend.

454
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,840
Wait, pending invites.

455
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,680
I don't have any.

456
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,720
Who did you...

457
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,820
There are no users to match your search.

458
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,440
What?

459
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,940
You sent me a fake code.

460
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,180
No, it's real!

461
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,680
You don't want to be with me?

462
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,460
It's real, it's real, it's real!

463
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,640
I'll give you mine and this one will be real.

464
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,740
This is like you're giving me a fake phone number.

465
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,160
Aren't you missing one number?

466
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,160
No!

467
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,720
I literally clicked copy and paste.

468
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,500
Add a friend and to friend code paste.

469
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,520
There you go, I sent you one.

470
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,980
Yippee!

471
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,820
You sent me one!

472
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,960
Mint Fantome.

473
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,980
You know, up until today I was like still always calling you Meido Minto.

474
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,640
You can still say that.

475
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,120
Some people just call me maid.

476
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,560
That one is annoying.

477
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,620
But I don't mind it, Meido Minto.

478
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:53,800
But like, then I checked your Twitter and everything and I realized, oh damn, she really doesn't have maid mint written anywhere.

479
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,780
It's just Mint Fantome.

480
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,360
What happened?

481
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,680
Were you ever maid mint?

482
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,300
Yeah, some places.

483
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,020
I think.

484
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,420
Interesting, okay.

485
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,560
Okay, we're friends now.

486
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:05,960
Yippee!

487
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,000
Yippee!

488
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,800
Just from today.

489
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,140
I'm gonna unfriend her after you guys, don't worry.

490
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,100
Don't lie!

491
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,940
That's not even funny because nobody would believe that.

492
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,520
Even for a second.

493
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,740
Okay, let me try to invite you now.

494
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,460
Invite me.

495
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,580
What the?

496
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,440
I just clicked something?

497
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,700
My screen went black.

498
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,680
Oh, I'm in ranks.

499
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,460
Ah, there you are.

500
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,520
Oh, you're naked.

501
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,140
Pretty much everybody has a basic...

502
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,440
Can you change your person?

503
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,100
Picture.

504
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,220
Probably.

505
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,400
Why does Crony have a different one?

506
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,180
Interesting.

507
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,420
Invite.

508
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:52,960
Retract.

509
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,840
My game is really slow all of a sudden.

510
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,200
Restart.

511
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,300
Hold on, I'm gonna restart.

512
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,280
Yeah, I'm gonna restart my game.

513
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,860
Oh, oh gosh.

514
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,160
Don't send... Oh gosh, I'm getting a bunch of error reports.

515
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:08,740
Don't send.

516
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,760
Oh my god, what's happening in Korraka?

517
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,740
Don't send, don't send, don't send.

518
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,760
I got like five error reports.

519
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,560
We're okay.

520
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,100
From where?

521
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:20,960
From Windows?

522
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,380
From the game.

523
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,610
Okay.

524
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:27,150
Sus.

525
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,230
Sus.

526
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,340
I don't have mods, so...

527
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,260
Okay, I'm okay.

528
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,320
Are you gonna invite me?

529
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,320
Yes.

530
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,160
Here, there you go.

531
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,420
Pending invitation.

532
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,660
Wait, it disappeared.

533
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,340
Where did it go?

534
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:57,680
What?

535
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,440
There it is, there it is.

536
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,080
There it is, there it is.

537
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,680
I got it, I got it, I got it.

538
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:06,660
No!

539
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,540
No, no, no.

540
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,540
What happened?

541
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:08,680
What happened?

542
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,400
You're not in, right?

543
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,220
You're not in, right?

544
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,760
No, no.

545
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,840
What is happening?

546
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,740
Are you...

547
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,560
Let me in, let me in, let me in.

548
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,090
Vlad Dracula left.

549
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,330
Accept!

550
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,450
I'm in, I'm in.

551
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,990
You're not.

552
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:44,830
I'm not.

553
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,650
Let me in.

554
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,180
I could do this forever.

555
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:53,760
Accept.

556
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,940
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

557
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,120
I'm so exhausted already.

558
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,080
Too much fun.

559
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,240
Wait, you're like a sexy lady.

560
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,600
I muted your chat.

561
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,080
You can't chat with me now.

562
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,280
What do you mean?

563
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,000
I have too much power.

564
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,860
Fine, I'll mute your chat.

565
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,180
Okay.

566
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:16,520
Fine.

567
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
I'm gonna report you.

568
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,620
No.

569
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,360
No, I'm gonna report you.

570
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,240
I'm gonna report you.

571
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,320
Okay.

572
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,160
Okay.

573
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:24,600
Okay.

574
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,590
So...

575
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,120
What else should we look at?

576
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,720
Standard?

577
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,740
Oh yeah, standard is finally...

578
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,000
Shut up.

579
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,260
Mute.

580
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,540
No!

581
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,320
You can't...

582
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,960
Don't silence me!

583
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,200
There's no way to change the speed of game.

584
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:48,940
It's okay.

585
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,800
I think we got it.

586
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,760
I don't know.

587
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,040
Okay.

588
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,780
We got this.

589
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,200
We got this.

590
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:54,460
We're even.

591
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,860
Am I gonna carry you?

592
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,900
No, I can hold my own.

593
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,060
Okay.

594
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,500
Really?

595
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,560
Yeah.

596
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,580
Together.

597
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,660
I was hoping together we'll be stronger.

598
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,300
Okay.

599
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,320
We're the dream team.

600
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,500
Yeah.

601
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,280
I believe in our combined power.

602
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,040
Okay.

603
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,720
Press I'm ready.

604
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,120
Oh, okay.

605
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,400
I almost left lobby.

606
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,000
The game begins now!

607
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,380
Story time.

608
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:35,400
Why did he keep it?

609
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,920
I'm gonna have that kind of decor.

610
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,700
To be or not to be.

611
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,680
Did I skip?

612
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:45,900
Did you skip?

613
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,960
You're saying something that's not here.

614
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,660
Because he's holding the skull.

615
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,540
Attila the Honey.

616
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,020
Attila the Honey.

617
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,980
Cutie Honey.

618
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,000
Cutie Honey.

619
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:14,880
Please!

620
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,540
Please!

621
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,200
Please!

622
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,140
I hear horses stepping.

623
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,720
They're coming!

624
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,360
I think you're ahead of them.

625
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,180
I hear the barbarians!

626
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,000
What?

627
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,200
You're crazy!

628
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,500
There's no barbarians.

629
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,480
They might be like all over the place.

630
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,040
Can you hear them?

631
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,260
I hear them now.

632
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,660
I stopped taking my meds so I can hear them.

633
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,420
Scary.

634
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,920
Okay, I'm done with the story.

635
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,080
I'm awaiting you on the battlefield.

636
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,660
You just cut off the man!

637
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,500
He was speaking!

638
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,320
Wait, who am I?

639
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,900
I'm purple.

640
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,360
What are you?

641
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,100
No, I'm purple.

642
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,400
No, we're purple.

643
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,920
They're purple!

644
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,280
Wait, then who are we?

645
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,140
For now we're just following them I think.

646
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,000
Or looking at them.

647
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,040
This way Attila!

648
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,280
The deco is kind of ugly.

649
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,220
Are they all our enemies?

650
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,000
Attila must survive.

651
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,200
Kill Bleda and return...

652
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,640
Wait, who are we?

653
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,160
You're orange.

654
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,280
I'm yellow apparently.

655
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,660
I don't see us.

656
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,520
Not yet, not yet.

657
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,880
But are we all against everybody?

658
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,080
No, we are with the... I see it now.

659
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,300
Look at the bottom right.

660
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,640
There are all kinds of different icons.

661
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,800
We are with the Huns and we are with each other because we all have the same...

662
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,380
Wait, we're supposed to do stuff.

663
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,260
Wait, can you control these?

664
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,200
Because I can.

665
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,400
No, I can't do anything.

666
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,240
Oh ok.

667
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,520
We're probably just going through the story right now.

668
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,020
Ok.

669
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,340
I guess I gotta do the story part.

670
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,300
You gotta do the hard work.

671
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,600
Come on!

672
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:32,760
By the time I was just standing around the enemies are already working on their economy.

673
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,260
Where are we going?

674
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,080
Wait, I'm the archers?

675
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,840
Am I the archers?

676
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,200
Wait, why are the purples attacking?

677
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,740
Kiwawa, this is all you?

678
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,760
This is all you?

679
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,780
This is unscripted?

680
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,800
Maybe just run.

681
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,160
Maybe you should...

682
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,040
No, no, no.

683
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,740
I would never run.

684
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,360
I'm not a coward.

685
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,480
I believe in you.

686
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,820
Kill the small guys.

687
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,100
No!

688
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,300
No!

689
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,520
You keep on fighting bro!

690
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,560
Wait, he is also against me.

691
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:15,860
Shit!

692
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,920
Wait, I'm supposed to survive.

693
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,820
Am I already failing?

694
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,420
Kiara, we were supposed to team up.

695
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,880
They said this was easy.

696
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,300
This wasn't easy chat.

697
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,600
This was not easy at all.

698
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,280
You should have run away.

699
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,820
Can we do it again?

700
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,960
Ok, re...

701
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,360
Rematch.

702
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,740
Why is it better?

703
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,480
I went...I left.

704
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,440
Oh, I'm looking at the map.

705
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,240
Where would I be?

706
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,580
Top right and then click on go to menu or whatever.

707
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:10,800
Ok.

708
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,740
Should I have ran?

709
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,440
You had the best military.

710
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,080
I was orange, I had nothing.

711
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,540
Your story arc was about to still unfold.

712
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,820
I didn't even have the chance to live.

713
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,820
I was still in the womb.

714
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,780
Sorry guys, it's difficult to pay attention to the story when I'm trying to also talk to her.

715
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:42,180
But I have to bait the boar and then let it kill Bleda apparently.

716
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,320
Then maybe you can also play after that probably.

717
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,380
Wait, did I...return?

718
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,500
No, what?

719
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,420
Guys, this is...

720
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,400
How to...

721
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,960
New lobby.

722
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,800
New lobby.

723
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,420
New lobby.

724
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,540
Invite me.

725
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,080
Ok.

726
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,620
I'm gonna bait the boar.

727
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,320
That boar is gonna rip that other guy up and then I will crawl out of his dead body.

728
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,120
And that's how I will start the game.

729
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,340
Wait, should I set a password if I can invite you anyway?

730
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,240
Is it necessary?

731
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,240
Nah, just invite me then.

732
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,700
Maybe you should do the beginning.

733
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,380
You got this, you got this.

734
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,600
I believe in you.

735
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,880
And I saw the map.

736
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,020
I know everything now.

737
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,480
Click where?

738
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,260
There's nothing here.

739
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,740
There should be an invite.

740
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,820
No!

741
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,180
Get out of the map!

742
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,720
Get out of the map!

743
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,820
I'm not in the map!

744
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,360
Are you in the main menu?

745
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,000
Yes.

746
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,280
Ok.

747
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:01,690
Invite!

748
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,890
Do you have my invite?

749
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:05,450
No.

750
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,130
Are you trolling me again?

751
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,910
No, I'm really not!

752
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,130
You're trolling me!

753
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:11,990
No, I'm not!

754
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:12,590
No!

755
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,670
This is what you get for crying wolf.

756
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,730
No, no, no!

757
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,510
What are you seeing right now?

758
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,030
Nothing.

759
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,210
Nothing.

760
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,130
Where are you?

761
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:29,830
I'm in the main menu.

762
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,390
Ah, you gotta go to the multiplayer lobby apparently.

763
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,410
Oh, what?

764
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,490
No, I got invited.

765
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,210
Somebody said that.

766
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,130
Ok, I'll try.

767
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,550
Find custom game.

768
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:46,530
Apparently, you just gotta be in the lobby in order to receive the invite in the first place.

769
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:47,690
Here, I invite you again.

770
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,070
Oh, you invite me again.

771
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:58,930
What?

772
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,050
I'm in!

773
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,070
I feel like that's...

774
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,470
Are you in?

775
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,470
Oh, you're in.

776
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:06,870
Ok.

777
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,170
Once again.

778
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,470
So...

779
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,810
I have to bait the boar and let it kill the other person.

780
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,130
Yeah.

781
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:15,970
I understand.

782
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,210
I think I understand.

783
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:17,890
Are you ready?

784
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,350
Yeah, I'm ready.

785
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:19,670
I'm ready.

786
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,030
I'm ready.

787
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,250
I press the button.

788
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:21,930
I'm so ready.

789
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,010
Ok.

790
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,990
Ok, we got this.

791
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:25,950
We're the Huns.

792
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,370
We got... We're the Hunnies.

793
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,390
We're the Hunnies.

794
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,310
You're watching what I'm doing, right?

795
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,090
Yeah, yeah.

796
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,150
I'm judging you.

797
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:33,990
I'm...

798
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,430
No, no, no.

799
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,070
Don't judge me.

800
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,890
Support me.

801
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:36,870
Tell me what to do.

802
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:37,510
Ok, ok.

803
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,890
You wanna skip this?

804
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:39,930
Yes.

805
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,250
Kill Bleda.

806
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,690
Kill that guy.

807
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,550
This guy sucks.

808
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,790
Ok, that guy.

809
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,110
I'm on the white horse.

810
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,330
There.

811
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,510
There she is.

812
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,730
Oh, they were serious about that.

813
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,590
Ok, ok.

814
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,350
Yeah, it's just a pig.

815
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,650
You gotta go, Kiwawa.

816
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:09,430
You gotta go.

817
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:09,890
He's gonna go.

818
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:16,370
Don't we need like some people watching us so they can attest and witness?

819
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,490
I'm watching.

820
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,210
I'm the witness.

821
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,050
Boar, follow me.

822
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:22,050
Ok.

823
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:23,890
There we go.

824
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,790
He's already... I didn't even do anything.

825
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,510
Nice.

826
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:31,970
Go Boar!

827
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,390
Go Boar!

828
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,850
Go Boar!

829
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,830
Go Boar!

830
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:35,650
Go Boar!

831
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,690
But leave the horse alone.

832
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,770
The horse did nothing wrong.

833
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:38,110
Go Boar!

834
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:38,970
Go Boar!

835
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,110
Maybe you should attack him too.

836
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,210
I don't think I can.

837
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:49,190
It would be unrespectful of me.

838
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,890
I don't think that guy should live though.

839
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,110
He attacked us.

840
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,750
See, he's dying anyway.

841
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,570
Oh, and now I get the rest of the Boar.

842
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,550
And I bring back home the meat.

843
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:06,770
Ok, I have to return to the camp.

844
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,650
Yeah, and then I become your people.

845
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,430
Yes, hopefully.

846
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,570
My dream will come true.

847
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,870
Hello everybody!

848
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,190
Hello guys!

849
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:19,430
What?

850
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,250
No!

851
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,270
No!

852
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:26,910
No!

853
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,090
It was the Boar!

854
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,910
I told you I need someone to witness it.

855
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,170
Oh, I think I'm these guys.

856
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,230
Oh, attack!

857
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:37,510
Kill them.

858
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,570
I'm gonna kill them.

859
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,510
Purple!

860
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,910
Purple, go away!

861
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,010
Yeah, kill the purple!

862
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,590
Kill the purple!

863
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:44,990
Yeah!

864
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,930
I'm here.

865
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,070
I'm your people.

866
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:52,990
This is me.

867
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,810
I'm here to follow you.

868
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,110
But I'm the protagonist.

869
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,950
You are the protagonist.

870
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:02,310
Oh wait, I'm a Deku.

871
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:03,550
This guy.

872
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,930
They paid tributes.

873
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:06,450
Nice.

874
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:07,470
And what now?

875
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,210
We gotta...

876
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,830
Zero out of two enemies.

877
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:12,590
Wait!

878
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,330
There is a guy coming!

879
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,470
He is a blue man.

880
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,150
He looks like a scout.

881
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,650
Get him!

882
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:20,170
Go get him!

883
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:20,890
I killed him.

884
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,050
Good.

885
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:23,890
Good job.

886
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:26,030
But that didn't count to...

887
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,410
My bloodlust!

888
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,470
Maybe we gotta go up?

889
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,930
Where the other purples attacked us?

890
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,970
We should free them.

891
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:47,970
Where are they?

892
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,710
They uncleared some of the map for us.

893
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:52,950
Oh yeah, we're going to orange.

894
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,150
Wait, I'm orange.

895
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,670
Is this your home?

896
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,470
Damn girl, you live like this?

897
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,330
I'm gonna start mining.

898
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,010
Can we even reach from here?

899
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,650
I think we gotta go the other way.

900
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,050
Yeah, go around.

901
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,310
Because there is a big cliff.

902
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,030
Oh, there is like rubble over here.

903
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,210
What did you do?

904
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,650
You really took out some people.

905
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,870
I didn't do anything.

906
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,450
I'm just one protagonist.

907
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,190
Hold on, I'm gonna move over.

908
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,270
Why is this guy not working?

909
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,530
Do I need to spawn?

910
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,070
Sorry guys.

911
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,170
Is this necessary?

912
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,070
Wait, hold on.

913
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:40,790
Is that you?

914
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,850
Yeah, hold on.

915
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,710
I'm trying to move over so people can see.

916
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,570
I always forget what the UI is.

917
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:47,390
Where am I?

918
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:49,910
I'm killing him!

919
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,110
I'm killing him!

920
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:52,070
I killed him.

921
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,530
See, there is like rubble here.

922
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,410
Why are we so close to everybody?

923
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:01,570
Oh my God!

924
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:02,930
Kill them!

925
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,190
Blue is evil!

926
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:07,190
Kill!

927
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:09,310
Kill!

928
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:10,090
Kill!

929
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,110
More rubble!

930
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,290
Ok, welcome to my house!

931
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,010
Oh my God, give me a tour!

932
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:22,910
We are in like the stone ages still.

933
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:23,510
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:24,610
It's a little embarrassing.

935
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,090
We are humble.

936
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,190
We are like, you know...

937
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,310
We got...

938
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,210
I can make people.

939
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,830
I'm gonna make more people.

940
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,130
I'm kinda concerned that we are not fast enough.

941
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,850
What are you talking about?

942
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:43,150
Where are those enemies?

943
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,770
I have four...

944
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:52,010
No!

945
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,170
We are not doing anything.

946
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,070
I have ten people that are not doing anything.

947
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,210
Oh wait, I only have one guy.

948
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,770
Get some berries.

949
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:03,770
They are working.

950
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:11,370
I don't know if this is important right now though, because I feel like this first campaign would just make you do whatever is in the objective.

951
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,950
Then why did they give us the option?

952
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,770
But we don't want any idle villagers.

953
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:18,470
No, no.

954
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,970
I don't think there is anything... Oh wait!

955
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:21,670
Horses!

956
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:23,830
Lots of horses.

957
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:24,990
Why was that scary music?

958
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,070
Right?

959
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:27,530
It's very terrifying.

960
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:28,070
Scary.

961
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:29,290
There is nothing here.

962
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,190
There is nothing over here.

963
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:35,950
I wonder if they expect us to breach the walls to the red side.

964
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:36,430
To red?

965
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:36,890
Okay.

966
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,030
Because that's the only place where I saw enemies.

967
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,670
Why can't I make more soldiers?

968
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,090
You can't?

969
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,630
I can't.

970
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:47,810
Oh, then you probably need more houses.

971
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,650
I have an idle one.

972
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:51,550
I don't think so.

973
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,610
Can you make a house?

974
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:54,730
Oh, no.

975
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:59,590
We can't make houses, so I don't think they expect us to like really boom or anything.

976
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,670
Okay, let's go invade.

977
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,810
We're just supposed to kill.

978
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,030
This gate looks weak.

979
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:06,630
Weak.

980
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:07,670
We got this.

981
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:10,810
Maybe they'll just open the door.

982
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,610
I'm gonna...

983
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:12,550
Hunts don't need houses.

984
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:16,050
Wow, this place is really destroyed.

985
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,530
I think it's this place where I'm at.

986
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:21,770
Really?

987
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:23,070
Okay.

988
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,250
Panzer Nomads.

989
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:30,350
We don't live like this because we don't live there at all.

990
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:33,510
Oh my gosh!

991
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,110
I'm getting attacked.

992
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:36,730
Wonderful.

993
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:37,810
Kill!

994
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:38,610
Kill!

995
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:40,390
Kill!

996
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,270
Oh, I think I understand.

997
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:46,350
They don't mean like two singular enemies.

998
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:50,550
They mean two full, like...

999
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,050
Full, yeah.

1000
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:54,250
Folks of people, like all of them.

1001
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:54,810
All of them.

1002
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,130
Kiwama, I think I have just three guys left and they're not doing so hot.

1003
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:00,430
What the heck?

1004
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:01,310
No!

1005
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:05,010
But you didn't start off with so many though, did you?

1006
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,590
I think my guys are a little weak.

1007
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:10,610
Orange guys are still in the Stone Age, you know, it's kind of hard for us.

1008
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,810
I'm also in the Stone Age.

1009
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:14,870
No, you had a better building than me.

1010
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:17,690
Eh?

1011
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,450
No, I'm also in the Stone Age.

1012
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:25,970
Oh, well Takaki-chan is in the Stone Age, but Bleda was in one above.

1013
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:27,770
Do we even need to...

1014
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,950
Don't... Pay no attention to the towers.

1015
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,350
But it's fine... Why do they have so many towers?

1016
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,650
They're not shooting anyway, so...

1017
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,430
Yeah, we can ignore.

1018
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:38,950
I think you can advance now.

1019
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:39,490
What?

1020
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:41,610
Oh, I can.

1021
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:44,850
But what... Am I actually supposed to do something?

1022
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:45,970
How am I supposed to heal?

1023
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,210
There is no healing.

1024
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,110
We just fail.

1025
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:50,950
Okay.

1026
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,850
One guy is really into...

1027
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:57,510
Here we go.

1028
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:58,950
Gosh, there's so many...

1029
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,750
There's so many towers.

1030
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,170
Don't bother with them.

1031
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:05,130
We gotta get the hunt captive too.

1032
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,490
How are we supposed to... We're just like 10 people.

1033
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:12,410
They probably already have like 50.

1034
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:13,150
50.

1035
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,030
Where are they?

1036
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,670
Maybe we should have gone to the red.

1037
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:17,730
I'm here!

1038
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:18,290
We're here.

1039
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,950
I think we should...

1040
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:24,190
No, let's go!

1041
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:24,650
Let's go!

1042
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,520
Where do we even...

1043
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,160
Oh, they are really advanced.

1044
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:37,520
Kill!

1045
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,200
Kill!

1046
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,680
Wait, I'm gonna go get some guys.

1047
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,640
Save them!

1048
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:42,520
Save them!

1049
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:42,820
Kill them!

1050
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,960
Oh, those people!

1051
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,560
Oh, they'll join us!

1052
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,160
Kill them!

1053
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:48,520
Kill!

1054
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,300
I mean, not kill.

1055
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,840
Destroy the gate.

1056
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,160
I saved them.

1057
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:56,520
You?

1058
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,160
Well, at least we're in Funeral Age.

1059
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:04,840
No, we're OK.

1060
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,580
We're OK.

1061
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:12,000
You have to collect them, I think.

1062
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:12,800
They are yellow people.

1063
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,200
OK, OK, OK.

1064
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,780
Collect them and then we'll bring them.

1065
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,820
Oh, there are some orange ones too.

1066
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,420
Oh, there are?

1067
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:20,980
OK, OK.

1068
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,620
OK, time to go home everybody!

1069
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,340
What's with the...what's with this one?

1070
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,420
What's with the green?

1071
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,960
OK, let's go home.

1072
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,580
Free him!

1073
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,120
Free!

1074
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,140
Free him!

1075
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:36,340
Free!

1076
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,440
No, I think this guy is an enemy, right?

1077
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,500
It says free the scythian scout.

1078
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,140
Oh, OK, we gotta free him.

1079
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,040
Nice, good job everybody.

1080
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:51,920
Teamwork.

1081
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,180
Stop bothering me!

1082
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,960
They're hitting me from the side!

1083
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,460
I have auto-heal or something, it seems.

1084
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:58,680
I'm also killing.

1085
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:00,420
Nice.

1086
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,000
Oh gosh, they keep reproducing!

1087
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:03,840
No!

1088
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,540
You are free, my friend.

1089
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,240
OK, let's go home.

1090
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,380
Time to go wherever you please.

1091
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,340
I have just one guy...we both have just one guy left.

1092
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,020
A truce!

1093
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:18,920
Follow green!

1094
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,540
Follow green!

1095
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,600
Oh, OK, OK.

1096
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,780
He went to the left.

1097
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,220
A truce!

1098
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:24,460
A truce!

1099
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,240
But should we send the villagers...

1100
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,920
No, they need to stretch their legs a little bit.

1101
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,300
OK, OK.

1102
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:34,900
Oh gosh, watch out.

1103
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:35,800
How are we doing?

1104
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,300
The Roman Empire!

1105
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,080
Wait, where did green go?

1106
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:40,800
Where did green go?

1107
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,760
He disappeared in the woods!

1108
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,740
Oh my god, he tricked us!

1109
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,840
He sent us over here!

1110
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,280
To get shot at!

1111
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,480
It's OK.

1112
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,060
Come on guys, let's go home.

1113
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:53,620
We'll deliver them.

1114
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,400
We'll find him.

1115
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,340
He should be close by.

1116
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,280
Which way are we going?

1117
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,080
Villager army.

1118
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,740
Yeah, should I just send them?

1119
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,980
Wait, I'll send them to work at home.

1120
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,380
OK.

1121
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,300
I forgot how to do it.

1122
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,980
You go here, and all my other people...

1123
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,040
I think that's everybody.

1124
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,220
OK, hold on, I'm going to send them to work.

1125
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,580
Everybody go to the mines.

1126
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,940
I can't multitask like this.

1127
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:24,480
I can't.

1128
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,240
Where's my character?

1129
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,840
Oh, I saw the green scout on the map.

1130
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,460
Yeah, I saw him.

1131
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,360
He was in my village.

1132
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,800
Now it's just us.

1133
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,280
There they go.

1134
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,740
Let's go towards our village then?

1135
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,680
Or is he just doing his job now, scouting?

1136
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,480
It says bring Attila to the...

1137
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,620
We gotta go to the village.

1138
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,000
OK.

1139
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:46,460
Where...

1140
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:47,800
Our...

1141
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,540
No, his village.

1142
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,600
Yeah, we gotta go to his village.

1143
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,300
We gotta go find him.

1144
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,080
This is so much for my brain.

1145
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:55,640
Oh my god!

1146
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:56,840
We see!

1147
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:58,840
It's huge!

1148
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,620
Wait, you...

1149
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,020
What?

1150
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,360
Wait, we have horses.

1151
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,300
We do have horses.

1152
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,230
Wait, why do they want...

1153
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,580
Why do they want horses when we freed them?

1154
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,340
They should be giving us horses.

1155
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,620
Oh, they can't get out.

1156
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:19,280
Well, I have free horses at home.

1157
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:20,240
At least.

1158
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:21,940
Where do you have horses?

1159
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,220
Over there.

1160
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,900
Do we have to pick them up?

1161
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,380
Oh, these are my horses.

1162
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:28,700
OK.

1163
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,000
I'm bringing horses.

1164
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,860
I got three horses.

1165
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,860
Oh, maybe it can be...

1166
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,520
Ah, there's free random horses.

1167
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,600
Ah, so...

1168
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,680
Right now, on the map, I found like random stray horses.

1169
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,060
Yeah.

1170
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,480
And when you select them, you can tell them to go up.

1171
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1172
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,360
That's what I was doing.

1173
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,420
Alright, come here.

1174
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:49,780
OK, OK, OK.

1175
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,320
Alright, they'll have plenty of horses.

1176
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,680
I have three horses coming in.

1177
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,500
Coming in hot.

1178
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,960
Four horses coming in hot.

1179
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,100
Really?

1180
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:56,460
Really?

1181
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:56,960
Yeah.

1182
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,140
I'm also sending in free right now.

1183
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,420
OK.

1184
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:02,360
Oh, I saw... I see three in your village.

1185
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,540
I see three in your village.

1186
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:04,700
In the yellow village.

1187
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,520
Yeah, but those have to kind of be like... like freed.

1188
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,480
Can my villager open this up for them?

1189
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,360
Wait, they can't get out.

1190
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,960
Yeah, how do you...

1191
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,160
OK, we got six horses.

1192
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,840
Oh, we got seven horses.

1193
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:22,640
Wow.

1194
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:22,820
Wow.

1195
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,840
Any more?

1196
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:30,060
Maybe we can give them a different animal and sell it as a horse.

1197
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,640
Destroy the post.

1198
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,380
Oh, what if we disguise a donkey and say it's a horse?

1199
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,020
I'll send three more.

1200
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,980
I first have to destroy the fence.

1201
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,760
OK, I'm gonna go search for horses.

1202
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,540
Oh wait, you can find three?

1203
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,220
You found three?

1204
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,000
Yeah, well, in the village.

1205
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,860
I'm opening up the fence.

1206
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,080
Am I supposed to actually be trying right now?

1207
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,880
Like, should I be doing stuff like this?

1208
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,580
Oh, I found a wolf.

1209
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,720
He didn't talk to me.

1210
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:05,500
Thank goodness.

1211
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:11,300
Oh, they're chopping wood or something there.

1212
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,180
No, no horse.

1213
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,000
That'll take a while.

1214
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,060
No horse.

1215
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,660
Any horse over here?

1216
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,280
I can't.

1217
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,240
I can't.

1218
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,260
There's a horse.

1219
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,000
Here, maybe?

1220
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,240
What if we send them deer and say it's a horse?

1221
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,440
Yeah, send deer.

1222
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,020
You're not supposed to look a gifted horse in its mouth or something like that.

1223
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:33,760
You know that?

1224
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:34,240
What?

1225
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,020
It's a German saying.

1226
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,540
Oh, what does it mean?

1227
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,460
I'm not sure.

1228
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:47,680
I just saw a green scout getting killed, but there's several, so I guess it was whatever.

1229
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,580
Did you ever get your horses out?

1230
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,820
I'm working on it.

1231
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,120
Guys, what does it mean?

1232
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,220
Don't look a horse in the mouth.

1233
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,640
It's got big teeth.

1234
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,320
It exists in English too, apparently.

1235
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:01,920
Really?

1236
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:06,220
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

1237
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,280
Oh, is it like a Trojan horse?

1238
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,660
Because you'll find people inside.

1239
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,200
Yeah, maybe.

1240
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,140
Gosh, the green empire is huge.

1241
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,440
No, it's more like the meaning is to be grateful of a gift.

1242
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:19,500
Don't nitpick it.

1243
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,580
Don't question it.

1244
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,660
But I guess it does come from the Trojan horse, but for that case, you should question it.

1245
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:30,420
I think, yeah, that makes me want to not trust it.

1246
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,700
Oh, I found two more horses at the edge of the map.

1247
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,500
Okay, I'm sending them.

1248
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:37,840
Where were they?

1249
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,860
But I still need my free, I think.

1250
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,640
We just need one more then, if you have two more.

1251
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:44,860
One!

1252
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,420
Oh, one in total.

1253
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,920
Come on, there's gotta be one more on this map somewhere.

1254
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,040
Are you exploring?

1255
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:53,840
No.

1256
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,140
Well, whatever the green guy explores, I can see actively.

1257
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:06,020
The thing is, I wonder if the blue village still had horses that we could steal.

1258
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,080
Well, I was just looking in there, but I can't see any.

1259
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,140
Like, it's all grayed out.

1260
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,220
This is gonna take forever.

1261
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,560
Destroying the fence.

1262
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,020
We could go to the red...

1263
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,100
Why is the red...

1264
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,200
How do I delete a building?

1265
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,780
Oh, because they're trapped in there.

1266
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,100
I see what you mean now.

1267
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:32,620
Ah!

1268
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:33,360
Okay!

1269
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,280
Okay, well...

1270
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,740
I am delivering... Wait, just one horse.

1271
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,000
We don't need to do more than that.

1272
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:50,080
Oh, you look at a horse's teeth and gums to see how healthy they are, but you shouldn't be judging how good...

1273
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,300
Oh, I see.

1274
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,120
How wise.

1275
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,580
Yeah, where's my guy?

1276
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,240
You're also there.

1277
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,600
Okay, last horse is coming!

1278
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,100
I hope they want them there.

1279
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,180
Yeah, you gotta send them to the flag.

1280
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,440
Okay, this is so chaotic, I'm so...

1281
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,860
It's okay, we're fine!

1282
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,080
We got the horses!

1283
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,260
Specific goals!

1284
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,440
But we still have 0 out of 2 enemies defeated.

1285
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,900
It means probably blue and red.

1286
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,120
Yeah, surely they'll help us with that, right?

1287
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,080
The green ones will help.

1288
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,720
Oh my gosh, I love the videos where they change the...

1289
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:35,620
What's happening?

1290
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,160
Oh!

1291
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,980
We have men!

1292
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:42,880
Oh my gosh!

1293
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:43,480
Look!

1294
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,440
They're coming from the west!

1295
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,580
They joined us!

1296
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,240
The dogs are coming!

1297
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:54,800
Let's go!

1298
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,460
Let's attack...

1299
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,140
Let's attack red?

1300
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,020
It's probably gonna give us an objective.

1301
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:02,700
Oh yeah.

1302
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,880
Blue should already be dead!

1303
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,840
Why aren't they...

1304
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,420
They should abdicate.

1305
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,240
Let's go to blue.

1306
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,260
Okay, let's go kill!

1307
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,360
We already did some basic damage anyway.

1308
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:15,660
Kinda.

1309
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,040
Well, we can...

1310
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,300
Yeah, we did.

1311
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,540
Where's their town center?

1312
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,340
Let's kill these guys.

1313
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,240
Oh, kill, kill, kill.

1314
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,320
Oh, here's some more coming.

1315
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,140
Where are they coming from?

1316
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,280
From where?

1317
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,080
We cannot lose!

1318
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:31,920
We cannot lose this!

1319
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,200
Yeah!

1320
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,860
They gave us all their men!

1321
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,260
Stay away!

1322
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:41,020
Stay away from dangerous arrow buildings.

1323
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:41,360
Okay.

1324
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,660
Oh, there's a town center here!

1325
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,720
Oh, that's a blacksmith.

1326
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,320
Just kidding.

1327
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,360
Is it this?

1328
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,980
Oh no, that's a university.

1329
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,900
Well, once we do enough damage, they will eventually just say, Okay, we're out, I think.

1330
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,680
Yeah, that's true.

1331
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,380
Oh, but come a bit deeper.

1332
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,980
I don't know why they're...

1333
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,260
What's this?

1334
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,120
This looks like a barracks.

1335
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,000
Oh yeah, defeat it so that they can't make more men.

1336
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,660
Actually, I'll do this one.

1337
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,740
I'll do this one so they can't make archers.

1338
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:17,860
It's always hard to tell which building is what you're looking for.

1339
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,580
I'm trying to... Oh my gosh, I'm getting attacked from all angles!

1340
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:23,560
No!

1341
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,880
No, why are you dwindling?

1342
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,020
Your numbers are dwindling!

1343
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:27,860
I know, I know, I know!

1344
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,180
I'm trying to figure out!

1345
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:30,560
Oh my gosh!

1346
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,600
Come here, come here, come here!

1347
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,400
Oh no, I lost a man!

1348
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,280
I lost a man.

1349
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:36,860
Come here, come here!

1350
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,920
I need you, woman!

1351
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:44,500
I'm trying, but they're still attacking me!

1352
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:45,880
I'm supporting you!

1353
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,980
Stay away from the towers!

1354
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,100
I'm trying to defeat the tower!

1355
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,860
Go so that not both towers can shoot you.

1356
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,220
But only...

1357
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,040
Also, if they don't have murder holes...

1358
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:06,400
If you're really close to one, they can't shoot you if you're like one block away.

1359
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,700
There's also guys attacking us, so...

1360
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:11,960
Attack this.

1361
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:12,940
Well, I can't be helped.

1362
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:17,460
Go!

1363
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:18,760
My men!

1364
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,420
Oh, we crumbled, we crumbled, we crumbled!

1365
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,860
I could probably make more...

1366
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:26,860
I'll make a couple more.

1367
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,360
The barracks is falling!

1368
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,320
The barracks is falling!

1369
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,000
What do I make?

1370
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,860
But I don't know if I want...

1371
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,060
Do I want walking people?

1372
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,800
Wait, you can make more people.

1373
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,300
I'll make a couple more people.

1374
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,720
Oh my gosh, they have another barracks.

1375
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,000
How do you make more people?

1376
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,000
Maybe you can't.

1377
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:58,420
I can't.

1378
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,780
I'm too sad.

1379
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,860
I have to multitask so much.

1380
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,780
What's going on?

1381
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:07,660
I can't look right now.

1382
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,140
What's going on over at the blue?

1383
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,220
H2?

1384
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,140
Oh, I can go to H2.

1385
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,720
I can advance to the feudal age.

1386
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,640
You can?

1387
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,220
Yeah!

1388
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:17,780
I'm advancing!

1389
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:18,480
Zing!

1390
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,960
The chat told me.

1391
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,660
Alright, we're gonna kill these guys.

1392
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:27,200
Really?

1393
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,400
Look, they are not even spawning more men.

1394
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,000
They're weak, weak, weak.

1395
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,840
This is not how you play Age of Empires!

1396
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,080
What?

1397
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:37,820
Yes it is!

1398
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,840
We're pillaging!

1399
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,740
Can make boat?

1400
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,680
Wait, where is boat?

1401
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,800
We don't have boat?

1402
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,300
Yeah!

1403
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:46,240
Yeah!

1404
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,280
We're pillaging!

1405
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,280
And we're taking down the city!

1406
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:52,180
Really?

1407
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:52,580
Are we?

1408
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,520
We're gonna take all their money!

1409
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:54,520
Yeah!

1410
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,800
Well, it's a little slow, but you know.

1411
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,840
It's a little slow.

1412
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,320
Alright, looks good.

1413
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,760
Nothing is attacking us, right?

1414
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,020
Why are they not stopping?

1415
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:06,980
I don't know.

1416
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:07,800
Why are they not leaving?

1417
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,060
I have a lot of gold.

1418
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:11,480
Let's see.

1419
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:12,620
I can make more buildings.

1420
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,260
Okay, this is good.

1421
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,880
Wait, I can build a barracks.

1422
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:16,660
Oh my gosh.

1423
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,280
Oh, let's go!

1424
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,260
Make the barracks.

1425
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:26,000
I'll make some skirmishers and some archers.

1426
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:27,480
I need more food.

1427
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,040
Build this.

1428
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,400
I advanced!

1429
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:37,700
I don't remember any key shortcuts anymore.

1430
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,480
Sorry, chat.

1431
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,420
I advanced.

1432
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,880
Okay, we took down two buildings.

1433
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,020
Man, we're wasting all our strong units.

1434
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:53,400
No, we're not getting attacked.

1435
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:53,880
It's okay.

1436
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,840
The blue will give up eventually.

1437
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,140
Why don't they give up earlier?

1438
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,140
Blue is AFKing.

1439
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,100
It's true.

1440
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,080
This is not how you play the game.

1441
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,000
There's no point.

1442
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,420
Guys, chill, chill, chill.

1443
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,620
Maybe I shouldn't...

1444
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:11,380
Why am I so close to red?

1445
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,140
I'm camping at their gate.

1446
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:14,380
I know.

1447
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,060
They are so close.

1448
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:16,840
It's kind of insane.

1449
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,880
Okay, now this.

1450
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,480
Make some boats.

1451
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,280
Fishing.

1452
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,380
Fishing ship.

1453
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:28,020
Okay, this is how you play the game, baby!

1454
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:29,460
Is it?

1455
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,160
Is it?

1456
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,420
Yeah, I think so.

1457
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,200
I'm upgrading.

1458
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,380
I can create men!

1459
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,100
I don't have enough food.

1460
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,120
Can you also create some women?

1461
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,760
I'll think about it.

1462
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,480
Am I ready for Castle Age?

1463
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:47,860
What do I need?

1464
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,880
I need more food for Castle Age.

1465
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,600
Blue is holding the game hostage.

1466
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,020
Report!

1467
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:53,440
Report!

1468
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:54,400
Go become food.

1469
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:55,640
Go become food.

1470
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,200
What the heck, man?

1471
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,120
Give up already!

1472
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,160
What's wrong with him?

1473
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:05,760
They are tough.

1474
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,700
They have nothing...

1475
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:15,600
After we defeat that, they have nothing else to create fighters.

1476
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,080
Yeah, you would hope so.

1477
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,600
But sometimes you think so and then the enemy...

1478
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,700
Like, you leave it because you think you destroyed everything they have.

1479
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,680
And then you leave and go to the next enemy.

1480
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,680
And in the meantime, the enemy that you thought you already completely demolished...

1481
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,240
Comes back five times stronger, rebuilding their economy.

1482
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:34,920
No!

1483
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,560
These guys are baby wimps.

1484
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:36,840
Happens to me.

1485
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,180
I hope so.

1486
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,360
They are baby wimps.

1487
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,780
Little baby wimps.

1488
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,320
We're okay.

1489
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:46,200
Baby wimps?

1490
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:46,640
Yeah.

1491
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,220
We're okay.

1492
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,020
You come to the stone.

1493
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,020
We need more stone.

1494
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,360
Where are my boats?

1495
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:57,660
Where are my boats?

1496
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,420
Oh wait, I can go to Castle H.

1497
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,060
I'm ready for Castle H, baby.

1498
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,880
Then I'll just place the castle right in front of their gate.

1499
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,600
Yeah, I'm trying to... I realized...

1500
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:13,060
If I had known from the beginning that we do have to kind of work on our economy...

1501
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:16,580
And not just go run around and do fun things, then I would have done that from the start.

1502
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:17,320
But okay.

1503
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,120
Here we go.

1504
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,180
We're working hard now.

1505
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:21,760
And hardly working.

1506
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:23,900
Yeah.

1507
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,560
Okay, now we build economy.

1508
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,460
Where are my boats?

1509
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,060
How do I send them to go fishing?

1510
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,560
Are you using boats to go fishing?

1511
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,300
Yeah, but they won't leave.

1512
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:38,680
Alright.

1513
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,000
I'll leave those waters to you.

1514
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:41,540
What?

1515
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:42,560
Click them?

1516
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,760
Oh, I didn't realize I had to click them.

1517
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:46,420
That's so funny.

1518
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:48,380
Funny.

1519
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:49,540
Funny.

1520
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,320
Okay, what else?

1521
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:55,520
Oh my God.

1522
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,060
Do you guys... Chat, do you think we have a chance?

1523
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:58,820
Yeah!

1524
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,720
We are 100%.

1525
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,760
We have a chance.

1526
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,700
We 100% have a chance.

1527
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,320
Okay.

1528
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:06,940
I believe.

1529
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:11,060
Also, Chat, what do you think is going on with Blue?

1530
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,380
What are their intentions?

1531
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:17,320
I can't make sense of it.

1532
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,820
Yes, it's fine.

1533
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:22,220
Yeah, we got a chance.

1534
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:22,980
We got this.

1535
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:24,080
In the bag, baby.

1536
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,200
They are so scared of us.

1537
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,200
They are like...

1538
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,280
They are shivering in their booties right now.

1539
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,580
Chat seems very certain.

1540
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,240
If they are certain, then okay.

1541
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:38,340
I'm gonna be in castle age in two seconds.

1542
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,900
I think they still have a stable.

1543
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:40,660
That's why.

1544
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,080
I need a feudal age building.

1545
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:44,300
What's a feudal age building?

1546
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,560
Oh, market, market.

1547
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,320
Come on, lady.

1548
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,860
I need a blacksmith.

1549
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,580
Everybody is busy.

1550
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:56,280
What?

1551
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,020
Blue is attacking us now.

1552
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,020
No, no, no, lady.

1553
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,540
Oh, this tower.

1554
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,560
This shitty-ass tower.

1555
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,380
Nobody is attacking me.

1556
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,840
Okay, you build...

1557
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,780
Nah, ignore the towers.

1558
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:12,800
Archery.

1559
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:12,920
Archery.

1560
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,900
I don't know what to attack.

1561
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,200
I don't see a stable.

1562
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,660
Oh well, let's do the blacksmith.

1563
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:18,320
The towers?

1564
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:19,360
The towers?

1565
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,900
You think that the towers are the reason why we are still...

1566
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,520
Why they are still alive?

1567
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:25,260
What?

1568
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,000
The towers.

1569
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:28,420
No.

1570
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,800
I'm taking out the...

1571
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,220
What am I taking out?

1572
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:34,820
What is this?

1573
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,060
A stone wall.

1574
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:36,840
No, no.

1575
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,080
Take out the...

1576
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,100
Should I just...

1577
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,200
Should we just go away and ignore them?

1578
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,380
They are not rebuilding, I think.

1579
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:43,800
You said that they are going to rebuild.

1580
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,120
Okay, okay, okay.

1581
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:48,800
Where is the town hall?

1582
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:49,520
Is this it?

1583
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:50,420
It's a market.

1584
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:52,160
This is...

1585
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,400
It's the monastery?

1586
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:54,580
Okay, it's the monastery.

1587
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:55,680
I'm taking it out.

1588
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,580
I'm taking it out.

1589
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,000
I'm joining you.

1590
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,000
Oh, the market...

1591
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,620
You go for the temple...

1592
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:01,580
The market.

1593
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,400
I'll go for the temple.

1594
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:03,980
Okay, okay.

1595
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,720
I can't deal with those fucking towers anymore.

1596
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,580
Just ignore them.

1597
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,160
Just ignore them.

1598
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,020
They don't matter.

1599
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:15,660
Chat, what's the shortcut for, like, selecting all of my fighting men?

1600
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:17,220
Oh, yeah.

1601
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:18,560
I don't want all, actually, though.

1602
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:19,020
Nevermind.

1603
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,320
I don't want all anyway, because some of them are down there.

1604
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,200
I'll just do it like this.

1605
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:26,280
How do I make a group again?

1606
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:29,320
Like, I select them and then I...

1607
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,360
What is it, like, city around and a number or so?

1608
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:32,160
Ah, yeah!

1609
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:32,640
Okay.

1610
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,020
Okay, I just need...

1611
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,340
I just need 800 food.

1612
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,460
I'll go to the castle age.

1613
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:37,840
I'm advancing.

1614
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:38,460
I'm advancing.

1615
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,000
Okay, good luck!

1616
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,200
I'm advancing!

1617
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,340
Do you know how to make enough food?

1618
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,220
Do you know?

1619
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,220
Do you know?

1620
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,720
You're gonna be fine.

1621
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,940
I have no stone.

1622
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:54,620
Do you have a market?

1623
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:59,020
You could buy stone at the market if you have enough of other...

1624
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:00,780
Oh, true, true, true.

1625
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,620
But only if you really think you have plenty of something else that you would trade.

1626
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,120
I'm stingy.

1627
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,100
I don't want to give anybody.

1628
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,580
That's why I take over places.

1629
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:11,100
I don't want to give them any, you know...

1630
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:22,140
I've been making a small little army in my village.

1631
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:22,340
Okay.

1632
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:27,100
I got 19 ready to go in the village.

1633
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,020
Nice.

1634
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:29,800
Nice.

1635
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,260
And we're almost done with blue.

1636
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:31,760
I hope.

1637
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:32,300
I hope!

1638
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,320
Yeah, we are.

1639
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,360
Yes, kill the scout!

1640
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,100
Waste your time by killing the scout!

1641
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:42,940
Run after him!

1642
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:43,780
Exactly, guys!

1643
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:45,680
Wait, we destroyed it.

1644
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:46,960
Why didn't they give up?

1645
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,380
Let's destroy the blacksmith!

1646
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:54,940
Blacksmith!

1647
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,000
Take it down!

1648
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:57,220
Everything!

1649
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:58,040
Everything!

1650
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:58,880
Take it down!

1651
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,420
We can do these two things at the same time.

1652
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:05,780
Take it down!

1653
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,540
Is it also the fishing port we need to take down?

1654
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:17,180
Oh my gosh, the red empire is like a real empire.

1655
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,300
Chiara, we're in trouble.

1656
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,040
Yeah.

1657
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:19,860
They're huge.

1658
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,440
How are...

1659
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,420
They're huge.

1660
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:21,920
They're defeated!

1661
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:22,900
Oh, blue is defeated!

1662
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:23,760
Oh, when did they...

1663
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,920
They recently must have...

1664
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:26,440
Oh, yeah!

1665
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:27,260
Okay, we can leave.

1666
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,180
Okay, we're out.

1667
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:28,840
We're out.

1668
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:29,320
We're out.

1669
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,240
Well, let's not go to red directly.

1670
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:36,140
Let's gather a big army and let's maybe make like trebuchets and stuff like that.

1671
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,160
Yeah, I'm going home.

1672
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,400
I'm gonna become...

1673
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,620
Okay, I'm going into the castle age.

1674
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,720
Okay, I'm already there.

1675
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,080
See you soon in the castles.

1676
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:47,820
Yeah, my people are stupid still.

1677
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:53,040
And once you have a castle, maybe you can also build a castle in front of the gate.

1678
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,880
No, but I don't think there's a point.

1679
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,040
They're actually huge.

1680
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,360
Just building one castle in front of their age... gate is...

1681
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,220
I can't speak!

1682
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:02,380
I'm too stressed out!

1683
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:03,560
Don't be stressed out!

1684
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:04,180
Don't be stressed!

1685
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,020
Oh, wow, you got...

1686
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,080
This is so much for me!

1687
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:06,960
You got a good army.

1688
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,660
Okay, I'll make a better army.

1689
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:10,960
You can't make traps.

1690
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:11,520
What the fuck?

1691
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,360
Battering rams...

1692
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,560
Gather here.

1693
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,140
Gather here.

1694
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:14,900
Yeah, sure.

1695
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:20,100
We need... Once you can, make a siege and then build a few battering rams.

1696
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:20,480
Okay, I...

1697
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,860
My people have...

1698
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,880
Kiara, my people have not even gone to a university.

1699
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,960
They barely know what a wheel is, okay?

1700
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,140
Like, they...

1701
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:27,780
Please!

1702
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,940
A wheel is triangle-shaped.

1703
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:33,980
Just so you know.

1704
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,240
Yeah, maybe I'll also...

1705
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:35,880
Should I build...

1706
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:38,280
University?

1707
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,020
Is it a waste?

1708
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,800
Oh my gosh, I'm almost at the castle age.

1709
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:43,800
I'm almost at the castle age!

1710
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:44,280
I do.

1711
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,100
Exciting, exciting, exciting.

1712
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,880
I have many foragers.

1713
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:50,520
Let's go.

1714
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,780
Do I even have...

1715
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,460
The right camps?

1716
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:53,900
Okay, yeah.

1717
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:55,700
Oh, now they're bored.

1718
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:56,800
Oh, gosh.

1719
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,160
Oh, that's a green guy.

1720
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:01,400
What are you doing over here, huh?

1721
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,660
Why are there green men in my area?

1722
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,080
This is my spot.

1723
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,420
We're allies.

1724
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:11,400
Excuse me.

1725
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:17,520
Yeah, I'm about to build a thing.

1726
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,620
Should I make a university?

1727
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:21,840
Is it worth it?

1728
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,520
Why not?

1729
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,740
Yes, I think it's good because you can destroy...

1730
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:35,480
You can make them study to destroy buildings faster and stuff, you know?

1731
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,060
I guess.

1732
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:38,920
No, that's gold.

1733
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,780
Did you feel that?

1734
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:44,340
I did.

1735
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,240
I did feel that.

1736
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,840
How do I open the chat, everybody?

1737
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:53,560
I have full control over you.

1738
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,180
I have a red in my territory.

1739
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:55,760
I ignore him.

1740
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:56,640
He's just a scout.

1741
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:57,280
No!

1742
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:58,460
No survivors!

1743
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,880
Wait, I need to build a siege.

1744
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,200
Okay, time for me to also build.

1745
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,180
I'm gonna build...

1746
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:11,680
I have no space, man.

1747
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:13,600
I have no space.

1748
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,180
I wanna build it, like...

1749
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,080
Can I build here?

1750
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,240
Will they feel too invaded?

1751
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:27,960
Wololo.

1752
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:36,560
Do you wanna be in charge of eventually having some monks and then...

1753
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,240
Yeah, that's what I'm making.

1754
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,020
...controlling them one by one?

1755
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:39,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1756
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:39,900
That's what I'm doing.

1757
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,680
I'll leave it to you because I hate that.

1758
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:42,500
What?

1759
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:43,480
It's the best part.

1760
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:50,820
Also, it seems like we cannot advance anymore further in this storyline.

1761
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,100
So we are at maximum advancement.

1762
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,780
No way!

1763
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:59,500
I have so much gold.

1764
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:00,120
Let's go.

1765
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,940
Oh my gosh, I can do a husbandry.

1766
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,060
I'm getting married!

1767
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,100
Wow, husband!

1768
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,780
That's also the only thing I can think of when I see husbandry.

1769
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,520
What does this mean?

1770
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:26,400
Oh, ok.

1771
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:26,960
It's just a scout.

1772
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,100
Sorry, you scared me.

1773
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:31,100
I saw multiple guys, different colors.

1774
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,060
They are so scary sometimes.

1775
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,520
Yeah, I get it.

1776
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:37,080
I know.

1777
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:37,660
I know.

1778
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:40,760
This game makes me so anxious when it comes to battle.

1779
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,700
I don't wanna battle.

1780
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:45,220
I can't.

1781
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,040
I can't, man.

1782
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:46,720
It's too much.

1783
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,580
What is this?

1784
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:51,900
Hey, scouty boy!

1785
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,940
Oh, the greens!

1786
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,540
Oh, see, I guess we still got the greens back.

1787
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,100
Yeah, they are helping us out still.

1788
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:58,800
Actually, are they though?

1789
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,260
Are they ever gonna attack with us?

1790
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,980
Or are they just chilling from now on?

1791
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:03,740
Oh, they might be chilling.

1792
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,000
But...

1793
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:05,820
I think they are chilling.

1794
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:07,140
It's ok.

1795
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:07,960
They are just chilling.

1796
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,020
We have a full... I'm getting monks.

1797
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,100
They are coming here.

1798
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,120
Everybody is setting up shop here.

1799
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,420
I forgot.

1800
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:19,380
You forgot?

1801
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:20,080
You forgot?

1802
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:24,920
I should have her do wood.

1803
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,840
We need more wood.

1804
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:31,260
Always keep an eye out that you have everybody on every resource.

1805
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:36,080
Gold might not be as important unless you are spamming knights.

1806
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,500
I think I'm gonna spam a few knights, so...

1807
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,080
I got a lot of gold.

1808
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,980
Are my boats not doing anything?

1809
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:46,840
What are you guys doing?

1810
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:47,740
Are you fishing?

1811
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:48,240
Wood, please.

1812
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:49,180
Enough wood.

1813
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:53,500
Wishing I was fishing.

1814
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:55,780
You could be.

1815
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,540
I could not be.

1816
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,620
Do you know how to fish?

1817
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:00,040
IRL?

1818
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:02,260
No.

1819
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:03,440
No?

1820
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:04,780
I wanna learn.

1821
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,500
Don't you wanna learn?

1822
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,440
Do you wanna go fishing?

1823
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:10,120
Actually, I wanna learn spear fishing.

1824
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,240
What?

1825
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:13,420
That's intense.

1826
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,200
But first I gotta learn diving.

1827
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:18,380
What?

1828
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,520
Yeah, in order to go spear fishing you gotta...

1829
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:26,520
I guess you could do it while snorkeling in theory, but you probably wanna get a diving license.

1830
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,040
Oh, my uncle knows how to dive.

1831
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:33,860
Can your uncle teach us?

1832
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:34,640
He could.

1833
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:37,260
Nah, you need a teaching license, I think.

1834
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:37,900
Oh, nevermind.

1835
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,700
I also don't trust that guy.

1836
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,700
Mark, trade gold for stone.

1837
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:47,800
Trade gold for stone.

1838
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,400
Trade gold for stone.

1839
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:52,980
Wait, do I want gold or stone?

1840
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:53,480
Oh yeah, see?

1841
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,920
Research arson.

1842
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:58,180
I'm researching arson so that we can defeat things better.

1843
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,480
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1844
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,940
Combined forces, baby.

1845
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,140
And then...

1846
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:08,340
We don't have them really invading our village.

1847
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,700
I don't think I need to research that.

1848
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:19,420
Wait, so if the Huns cannot build houses because they are nomads...

1849
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:22,200
Are we capped at 75?

1850
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:25,000
Then I don't want too many villagers.

1851
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,980
Can you kill villagers?

1852
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,280
Just send them into the red base.

1853
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:35,640
Yes?

1854
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,960
Oh, we're capped, so I don't want too many villagers.

1855
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,080
Oh, so it's strategy.

1856
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:39,860
Wow.

1857
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:41,520
I'm just gonna make a big army.

1858
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,100
Yeah.

1859
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,980
They fire with more accuracy.

1860
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:50,840
Oh yeah.

1861
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:52,760
I'm getting all the upgrades.

1862
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,380
I'm getting everything to make my guys crazy.

1863
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,280
Oh, I don't have enough wood.

1864
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,440
Okay, keep chopping.

1865
01:17:58,760 --> 01:17:59,260
Chop, chopping.

1866
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:04,720
What's wrong?

1867
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,520
I'm thinking...

1868
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,100
Oh, a castle.

1869
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:11,380
I need a castle.

1870
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,840
Yeah, me too.

1871
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,320
I'm gathering stone.

1872
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:16,640
Wait, I could be gathering more stone.

1873
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,260
I don't really have much stone.

1874
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,340
A lot of stone.

1875
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,340
You have stone?

1876
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:23,400
It needs 650 stone.

1877
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:29,600
If you have too much food or too much wood or so, you could...

1878
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,560
What are you guys doing?

1879
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:31,820
What are your orange people doing?

1880
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:32,960
They're moving back.

1881
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,340
Oh, I took the horses.

1882
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:35,780
Sorry.

1883
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:39,660
Oh, so you get the horses.

1884
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,340
They're on my land.

1885
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:43,440
I mean, I'm on this side of the river.

1886
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:44,300
I'm just saying.

1887
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:51,820
I was gonna say, if you don't have enough stone around you to gather, then you can just get it through the market.

1888
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:52,840
I will have to buy.

1889
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,540
Sell whatever you have an abundance of.

1890
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:55,460
I will have to buy.

1891
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:56,900
Okay, that should be good though.

1892
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,720
All right, now I need a free person.

1893
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,500
Well, technically, none of them are free.

1894
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,420
Okay, I make my castle.

1895
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,440
Maybe not right at the wall.

1896
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,100
Maybe...

1897
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,360
Maybe here.

1898
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,920
I'm gonna take you.

1899
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:13,480
Take you.

1900
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:13,880
Come here.

1901
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,140
I need two people.

1902
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:17,440
This is a two-person job.

1903
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,380
Make the castle.

1904
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:21,180
Can you take over Blue's resource?

1905
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:27,880
I guess we could, but I don't think we're that urgently in need of their resources.

1906
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:28,580
Are they?

1907
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:29,680
Oh, yeah, they gave up.

1908
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:30,040
That's right.

1909
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:30,360
I forgot.

1910
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:40,040
Yeah, so we could, like, continue to use their headquarters for our purpose, but I don't think we need to do that.

1911
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,840
I'm gonna start trading with you, okay?

1912
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,580
Oh, we're gonna be my little trade partner.

1913
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:48,380
Oh, sure.

1914
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:49,040
All right.

1915
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,200
Go at it.

1916
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:50,920
Have fun.

1917
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:53,480
I'll give you anything you want.

1918
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:59,360
As long as I don't die from giving you too much.

1919
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,800
No, we're gonna be...

1920
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,540
I'll give you all I got.

1921
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:02,980
Okay.

1922
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:06,140
I want you to flourish.

1923
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:08,520
Give me some of your people.

1924
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:10,980
No, make your own.

1925
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:11,420
Okay.

1926
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:12,820
What are you doing?

1927
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:14,500
Why are you not making more villagers?

1928
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:16,220
Actually, never mind.

1929
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,280
Don't make more villagers.

1930
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,000
Where's your market?

1931
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:18,520
Okay.

1932
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:19,860
He's heading over.

1933
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,700
He's gonna come trade with you.

1934
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:22,880
Look at him go.

1935
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,660
Oh my God.

1936
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:27,620
Should I do that too?

1937
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:30,800
Oh my gosh, our castles are gonna almost be touching.

1938
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,100
Wait, do you see this?

1939
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,400
Shut up!

1940
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,700
Oh, you're also building at the bridge.

1941
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,000
What made you think you need to build on the bridge?

1942
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:39,900
We're so insane.

1943
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:41,940
We're so insane, you guys.

1944
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:42,840
This is crazy.

1945
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,680
What are you making?

1946
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,720
What units do you wanna make?

1947
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:50,520
In the castle?

1948
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:53,640
Anything's fine.

1949
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,820
Look at your little army and my little army.

1950
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,640
They're all gonna join forces together.

1951
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:00,940
Oh my gosh, he's running.

1952
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,440
He's so weird.

1953
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:04,940
My horse is running.

1954
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:06,580
He's so fast.

1955
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:07,900
Go, go, go.

1956
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,360
He's on a mission.

1957
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,200
He's ready to trade.

1958
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:14,940
But then...

1959
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:17,600
Actually, maybe we should be stealing everything from green.

1960
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:19,820
Yeah?

1961
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,100
Yeah.

1962
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:25,100
Because if we trade with each other, it's like kinda...

1963
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:27,380
I don't know how that works, honestly.

1964
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,120
I never really thought about it too deeply.

1965
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:30,760
I wish I could build a bridge.

1966
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,840
I've never done that before either.

1967
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,560
Oh my gosh, he can go this way.

1968
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,520
You're a trader?

1969
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:42,440
I'm a trader, yeah.

1970
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,380
He's a trader.

1971
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,220
Did somebody ask what we're playing?

1972
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,200
We're playing Definitive Edition, chat.

1973
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:53,480
Can't you tell?

1974
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:57,860
Why would I build an outpost?

1975
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:58,340
Ah, here.

1976
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,180
Okay, so how does this work?

1977
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,560
We just right click on their market.

1978
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,000
And then we get, like, resources.

1979
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:06,040
Let's go!

1980
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,040
I guess I haven't really built any farms.

1981
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:11,900
Wait, what did I just do?

1982
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:13,640
Oh, not the reseed.

1983
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:14,400
How do I do this?

1984
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:16,100
Which unit is better, chat?

1985
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:18,960
A petard or a tarkhan?

1986
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:19,580
There we go.

1987
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:23,880
Petard is kind of cheaper on gold.

1988
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,100
Or marauders.

1989
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:28,860
Great tarkhans at stables.

1990
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,180
What are you talking about?

1991
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:32,360
Tarkhans.

1992
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,420
They want tarkhans.

1993
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:34,440
Chat wants tarkhans.

1994
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:35,240
Oh, they're on horses.

1995
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:36,880
I want elephants.

1996
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:37,880
They're kind of expensive.

1997
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,000
We need a lot more gold.

1998
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:40,320
You want elephants?

1999
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:40,860
Yeah.

2000
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:41,900
I don't think you can have elephants.

2001
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:42,480
No!

2002
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:43,600
With the hounds?

2003
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,720
Oh yeah, with the hounds.

2004
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:45,220
No!

2005
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:47,520
Keep dreaming.

2006
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:48,700
Guys, look at our castles.

2007
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,440
They're so close.

2008
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:51,480
What if I just ended up attacking Kiara?

2009
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:56,320
Oh, petard is a suicide bomber.

2010
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:56,760
Shit!

2011
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,060
Crazy, mad lad.

2012
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,820
When they attack, they just die also.

2013
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:03,980
We don't want that.

2014
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:10,480
Chat, can you tell us when you think we are ready to go attack?

2015
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:12,360
I think we're ready.

2016
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:13,500
Yeah.

2017
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,220
No, I don't think so.

2018
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:17,360
I think red has elephants.

2019
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,040
Oh, fuck.

2020
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:22,740
That means we need the...

2021
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:23,380
The bombers.

2022
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:25,480
We need the vololo.

2023
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:26,780
I have vololo.

2024
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:28,520
I'll make more.

2025
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:29,180
Skirmishers?

2026
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:31,340
Go now.

2027
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:31,860
More ramps.

2028
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:32,620
Oh, more ramps.

2029
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:35,720
Was that too much?

2030
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:39,840
When you max out, then attack.

2031
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:44,320
When you have 75 out of 75...

2032
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:44,920
Tell me.

2033
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:46,260
75 out of what?

2034
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,840
Total of people.

2035
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:52,640
Pikemen.

2036
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:54,540
We need pikemen mostly.

2037
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:56,860
I'll make more pikemen.

2038
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:58,040
Oh, I don't have enough wood.

2039
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,040
Because they're strong against elephants.

2040
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:03,960
I think you probably said this earlier, but how do I open the chat?

2041
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,000
The chat?

2042
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:06,560
In the game.

2043
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:10,040
No, I don't remember.

2044
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:11,380
Enter.

2045
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:12,160
Enter?

2046
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:14,420
Ok,

2047
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:17,740
ok.

2048
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,120
You're good now.

2049
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,060
By the way, I'm almost at 75.

2050
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,220
Wait, what's the fun part?

2051
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,720
What was that?

2052
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,800
You can resign now.

2053
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,100
Go resign.

2054
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,080
Just resign.

2055
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:46,000
Just go home.

2056
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,220
Oh, wait.

2057
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:49,960
I did the wrong one.

2058
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,500
I can't hear anything you're doing.

2059
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:53,220
Is it because you're muted?

2060
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:55,140
Because I muted you?

2061
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,300
Oh, you muted me!

2062
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,060
I guess I still have you muted as a joke.

2063
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,200
No, I can hear yours.

2064
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:03,620
Oh, really?

2065
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:07,140
So one-sided.

2066
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:07,920
I know.

2067
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:09,540
I'm sorry.

2068
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,940
Well, just say what you want to say to me directly.

2069
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:16,100
I don't want no in-between between us.

2070
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:16,120
Ok.

2071
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,440
All hail, king of the losers!

2072
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:23,900
Oh, wow.

2073
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,500
That just does not have any impact.

2074
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,280
Wololo.

2075
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:30,480
Fine, I won't wololo.

2076
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,920
Guys, I can't tell what my army is.

2077
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,340
We're gonna go now, because I'm full.

2078
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:42,680
How about you?

2079
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:43,560
Oh, we're going?

2080
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,080
Well, soon.

2081
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,880
How many army do you have?

2082
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:47,740
Let me make more.

2083
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,020
I'll make more Tarkin.

2084
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:49,020
Oh, you're looking pretty good.

2085
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,340
I'll make more Pikeman.

2086
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:54,540
It's because I didn't have a lot of wood.

2087
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,760
Oh, I can make more monks.

2088
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:01,520
I wish I could separate my monks.

2089
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,660
Oh, I have random horses in here.

2090
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,560
Go away, random horses.

2091
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:08,640
I think, are we supposed to eat those?

2092
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:09,820
Can you?

2093
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:12,020
Because we can't make them into units.

2094
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,100
Are they there to be eaten?

2095
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,220
That's a great question.

2096
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:22,600
I'm gonna try.

2097
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:24,860
No, you can't eat them.

2098
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:28,740
What do you mean?

2099
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,840
Did you try attacking them?

2100
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,840
Well, with the person, yeah.

2101
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,460
Also, they're stuck in my army.

2102
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:37,460
I think they want to stay.

2103
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,600
Oh wait, I can make them auto scout.

2104
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,160
The horses alone?

2105
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:43,300
With no rider?

2106
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:43,940
Yeah.

2107
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,580
They'll just go back into the wilderness.

2108
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,040
They're like stuck in there.

2109
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,760
My army is too packed.

2110
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,220
Be free, horse!

2111
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:54,040
Okay, there he goes.

2112
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,060
Bring him over to me.

2113
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:57,960
There he goes.

2114
01:26:58,460 --> 01:26:59,480
Off into the world.

2115
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,060
Don't bother, guys.

2116
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:00,720
Don't bother.

2117
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:03,900
I'm trying to get them out of here.

2118
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,980
Three horses stuck in here.

2119
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,060
Go over there.

2120
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:11,000
And you go over there.

2121
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:14,480
Alright.

2122
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:17,460
It was like control one or something, right?

2123
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:20,380
I'm trying to separate my guys real quick.

2124
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,500
Yeah, me too, me too.

2125
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,640
What the hell are you doing?

2126
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:25,760
Oh, he's like...

2127
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:26,440
He's Fortnite.

2128
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,720
We're almost about to go!

2129
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:34,920
We're almost about to go!

2130
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:38,240
Oh my gosh.

2131
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:38,760
Oh my gosh.

2132
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:39,360
Oh my gosh.

2133
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:43,620
Okay.

2134
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:46,940
One, two, three.

2135
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:50,580
I think that's all of the monks that I have.

2136
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:53,700
Okay.

2137
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,000
We got ten monks.

2138
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:56,940
Probably.

2139
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,740
What are you guys doing?

2140
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,660
Okay, I have room for four more.

2141
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:04,240
So I'm gonna make four more pikemen.

2142
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:05,520
Okay.

2143
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:07,220
Wait, you have monks too?

2144
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:08,860
Yeah, I got ten monks.

2145
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,360
Nice.

2146
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:13,780
That's gonna be fun.

2147
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:14,640
Ten monks?

2148
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:16,140
That's kind of a lot.

2149
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:18,680
I like the monks.

2150
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,120
This is amazing.

2151
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,420
Building hit points.

2152
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:21,940
Okay.

2153
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:23,980
Come here.

2154
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:26,600
Maybe the university was useless.

2155
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:27,860
I think...

2156
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:29,260
Okay, control two.

2157
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,380
Okay, you guys all come over here.

2158
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:31,880
Okay.

2159
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,100
Now we have that control.

2160
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:37,820
And we'll have you guys be the third.

2161
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:40,220
Okay.

2162
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,540
Should I man my rams?

2163
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:44,920
Is that how that works?

2164
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:46,640
I'm almost out of gold.

2165
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:47,460
Oh, wait.

2166
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:50,600
You build...

2167
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,280
this here.

2168
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:52,880
And you.

2169
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:54,980
It's okay, you don't need no more gold.

2170
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,500
I guess we are about to destroy everything and win the game.

2171
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:01,580
Yeah, we are about to do that.

2172
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:05,820
I'm coming over here.

2173
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:08,880
There we go.

2174
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:12,580
I'm ready!

2175
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:14,560
No, no upgrades.

2176
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:16,400
Okay, ready?

2177
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,640
Alright, alright, alright.

2178
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,860
My monks are really slow though.

2179
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:24,080
Why am I hearing that?

2180
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:26,420
What is that?

2181
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:30,960
Who's attacking?

2182
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,140
Maybe it was just in our heads.

2183
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:36,960
Maybe it was a preview of what's to come.

2184
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:37,680
Or stuck.

2185
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:43,240
Okay, I'll send my rams first to breach the walls.

2186
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:43,720
Upgrades?

2187
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,780
I did my upgrades.

2188
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:45,680
I did all my upgrades.

2189
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:47,020
Did you do all your upgrades?

2190
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:48,620
Pretty much.

2191
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:52,840
They have a big...

2192
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:54,460
lake in between.

2193
01:29:56,420 --> 01:29:58,680
Maybe we should cross here actually.

2194
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:00,120
Actually, yeah.

2195
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,680
No, I think we have to...

2196
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:04,560
Do you know where I mean with here?

2197
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:05,100
Nope.

2198
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:09,380
How do I point out something again on the map?

2199
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,160
Oh, like where the deer are?

2200
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:12,500
Up north?

2201
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:14,560
No...

2202
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,920
I don't think we can cross there.

2203
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,560
There is a bridge.

2204
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:22,140
I think the bridge is by... we have to go down?

2205
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,220
Oh my gosh, they are attacking!

2206
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:28,440
I see them.

2207
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:31,540
I saw their army for a brief second.

2208
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,340
Are there many?

2209
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:37,880
We should just go down here.

2210
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:42,220
Like kind of at the bottom, there is like a traversable path.

2211
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:43,600
How did you make those things?

2212
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:44,600
The battering rams.

2213
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,000
I make those things.

2214
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,140
Let's go down.

2215
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:54,160
Signal alley.

2216
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,920
Oh, I see, I see, I see, I see.

2217
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,420
I saw it, I saw it, I saw it.

2218
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:00,640
That's where we gonna go.

2219
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:03,820
It seems like, you know, there is a certain path there.

2220
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:04,820
Yeah, yeah, I see it, I see it.

2221
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:05,760
Might take a while though.

2222
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:07,680
I see...

2223
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:09,360
Let's get moving, let's get cooking.

2224
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:11,400
This area is quite tropical.

2225
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,280
We are going to a beach paradise over here.

2226
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:15,800
Are you guys...

2227
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:18,640
Oh, I think I accidentally am sending my gold miner.

2228
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:19,480
Oh, I see him!

2229
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:22,420
There are some ships there.

2230
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:23,700
Oh, they got battleships!

2231
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,060
Oh my god!

2232
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,620
Wait!

2233
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:28,860
Avoid, avoid, avoid!

2234
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,700
Oh, they are looking at the...

2235
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:33,640
Avoid, avoid, avoid.

2236
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:36,080
Should I send the rams for the ships?

2237
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:38,800
No, I don't think so.

2238
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:40,020
I don't think we should worry about them.

2239
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:43,860
But they are right at the path that we are about to traverse.

2240
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:44,920
Oh, you are right.

2241
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:48,900
Good question.

2242
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,040
Oh my god, he is attacking here!

2243
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:52,840
Ah, just that one.

2244
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,080
It's just a scout, right?

2245
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,160
No, he was attacking your battering rams.

2246
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,340
Ok, stop, stop, stop.

2247
01:31:57,620 --> 01:31:58,300
Ignore the ships.

2248
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:03,520
Ok, let's try to, as quickly as possible, get over the water while ignoring everything else.

2249
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,040
Yeah, yeah, just ignore the ships.

2250
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:05,840
Oh gosh.

2251
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:06,600
Oh my gosh.

2252
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,020
Wait, I'm scared!

2253
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,460
There is an elephant!

2254
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:11,020
Elephant!

2255
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,720
Wallow the shit out of him!

2256
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:15,760
Wait, where did he go?

2257
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,300
Wait, I'll let your monks go front.

2258
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,160
Are you monks?

2259
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,000
Your monks are so far!

2260
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:31,940
Convert!

2261
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:32,800
Convert!

2262
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:33,120
Convert!

2263
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,300
Oh, there is a traffic jam!

2264
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:36,400
There is a traffic jam!

2265
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,200
He's ours!

2266
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:39,200
He's ours!

2267
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:40,460
He's ours!

2268
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,760
No, don't let him die!

2269
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:45,000
Keep going!

2270
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,000
Oh my gosh, keep going.

2271
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,020
Good emergency food.

2272
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:50,420
I don't think that worked.

2273
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:53,620
I mean, we could kill those boats.

2274
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,820
We destroyed the ship!

2275
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,200
We are destroying them somehow.

2276
01:32:58,780 --> 01:32:59,780
Oh, you're doing it.

2277
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:02,820
I got an elephant!

2278
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:03,760
I got an elephant!

2279
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:06,620
Ok, I will breach the walls.

2280
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,460
The gates maybe in particular.

2281
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:15,260
Get the elephant!

2282
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:15,880
Get the elephant!

2283
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:15,880
I am!

2284
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,140
I am!

2285
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:22,700
He's ours!

2286
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:23,060
He's ours!

2287
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,360
He's ours!

2288
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:27,780
I don't know everything!

2289
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:28,780
I don't know everything!

2290
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:31,160
I don't know what to do!

2291
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:34,480
My ramps can't get through!

2292
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,580
Another elephant!

2293
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:38,200
Another elephant!

2294
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:38,780
I'm getting him!

2295
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:39,400
I'm getting him!

2296
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,160
Wololo!

2297
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:41,260
Wololo!

2298
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:41,740
Wololo!

2299
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:42,660
Yippee!

2300
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:43,240
Yippee!

2301
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:45,460
Now you get the elephants of your dreams!

2302
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:48,320
Can you move those fat elephant asses and let my ramp through?

2303
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,060
I'm trying!

2304
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,240
Oh gosh, they got big things.

2305
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,420
They are coming for us!

2306
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,020
They are coming for us!

2307
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,080
Wololo!

2308
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:56,400
Wololo!

2309
01:33:57,260 --> 01:33:57,640
Wololo!

2310
01:33:58,680 --> 01:33:59,840
I don't have enough face.

2311
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:08,100
The ramps are so confused!

2312
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:09,760
Ah!

2313
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:10,560
Ah!

2314
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:13,920
Just attack it!

2315
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:14,540
Is this ok?

2316
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:16,140
Is this going well?

2317
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:17,760
I don't know!

2318
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:18,820
More wololo!

2319
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:19,480
More wololo!

2320
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:20,400
I'm trying!

2321
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:23,760
Oh we are in!

2322
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:24,560
We are so in!

2323
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:25,180
Are we?

2324
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,560
I think... Are we dwindling?

2325
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:29,940
Go inside!

2326
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:30,500
Go inside!

2327
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:31,260
Just go inside!

2328
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:32,540
Go inside!

2329
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:33,040
Go in!

2330
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:33,460
Go in!

2331
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,020
Go in!

2332
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:37,520
They are sending more elephants!

2333
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,240
It's hard to get in here!

2334
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,900
I'm gonna kill some of the elephants!

2335
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:46,660
Yummy!

2336
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:46,980
Yummy!

2337
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:47,860
It's really fast!

2338
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:50,800
Oh this is fine!

2339
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:51,880
Alright!

2340
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:52,300
Alright!

2341
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:56,860
My ramps did nothing!

2342
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:58,680
Go team go!

2343
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,480
Let's enter!

2344
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:04,220
Let's enter!

2345
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:07,700
Oh god!

2346
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:09,680
I feel like we are not gonna be enough!

2347
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:12,120
Wait!

2348
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:12,940
Take down that one!

2349
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:14,580
We are gonna be fine!

2350
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:16,140
If that's all they are sending...

2351
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:17,920
They are like... We don't have that much!

2352
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:18,920
We might be ok!

2353
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:19,540
We might be ok!

2354
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,820
I've only lost 5 men apparently!

2355
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,460
So it could be worse!

2356
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:32,540
I think I've lost more!

2357
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:33,640
I'm getting more!

2358
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:34,880
I'm getting more elephants!

2359
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:35,380
Wait!

2360
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:35,700
Stop!

2361
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:35,960
Stop!

2362
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:36,220
Stop!

2363
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:36,840
What are you doing?

2364
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:39,260
Yo!

2365
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:40,020
Get those elephants!

2366
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:40,560
Hell yeah!

2367
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:40,980
Yeah!

2368
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:41,180
Yeah!

2369
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:41,560
Yeah!

2370
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:43,580
I found the town center!

2371
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:44,300
Oh you did?

2372
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:47,600
I'm gonna go get them!

2373
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:49,520
Can you get that elephant?

2374
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:50,360
He's almost dead!

2375
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:51,300
He's almost dead though!

2376
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:51,980
He's almost dead!

2377
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:52,780
He's dead!

2378
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:54,600
Let's kill innocent people!

2379
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,340
I don't think they are innocent!

2380
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:57,320
They are not innocent!

2381
01:35:58,060 --> 01:35:59,120
The villagers are innocent!

2382
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:00,940
No mercy!

2383
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:02,720
No mercy!

2384
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:04,900
No mercy!

2385
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:05,780
Oh my gosh!

2386
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:06,840
Elephant versus elephant!

2387
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:09,980
I'm trying!

2388
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:10,440
I'm trying!

2389
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:11,660
Oh I don't have him!

2390
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:13,960
He's gonna trample all over me!

2391
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,840
He's trampling all over me!

2392
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:17,360
He's ours!

2393
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,020
He's ours!

2394
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:20,340
Stop it!

2395
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,020
I need to make more...

2396
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:24,440
No!

2397
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:26,960
I need more face!

2398
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:28,540
I don't have enough face!

2399
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:29,760
They are building!

2400
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:32,640
They are rebuilding!

2401
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:35,960
Don't let Attila die!

2402
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:36,820
He's fine!

2403
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:37,900
He's very fine!

2404
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:39,680
He's a fine man!

2405
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:41,460
Oh we are fine!

2406
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,380
We are gonna be fine!

2407
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:46,640
But I'm making a few more pikemen while we are at it!

2408
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:47,960
Ok, that's a good idea.

2409
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,620
I'll make some more too.

2410
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:59,080
We are so infiltrating their system.

2411
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:02,680
Research...Oh I must have before convert buildings.

2412
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,000
Oh, I don't have it.

2413
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,920
Elephant, what are you doing?

2414
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:08,680
Burn this down!

2415
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:11,460
Nevermind!

2416
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,480
Burn this down!

2417
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:14,500
Burn down this table!

2418
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,740
Where are they getting more elephants from?

2419
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,020
My elephants are fighting other elephants!

2420
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:25,860
Yeah!

2421
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:27,060
Take them down!

2422
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:30,860
Oh god, I have so many resources.

2423
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:33,540
Keep on making pikemen.

2424
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:34,220
Faster!

2425
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:34,600
Faster!

2426
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:34,980
Faster!

2427
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:37,060
Where is their castle?

2428
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:42,420
What am I destroying right now?

2429
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:43,360
A stable.

2430
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:45,180
I have not seen the castle yet.

2431
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:46,420
Probably deeper inside.

2432
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:48,480
There is no deeper inside.

2433
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,580
I have no more rams, but it's ok.

2434
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,120
Should I go deeper?

2435
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:57,980
I'm going deeper!

2436
01:37:58,100 --> 01:37:58,800
I'm going deeper!

2437
01:37:58,860 --> 01:37:59,520
Me too!

2438
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:00,020
Me too!

2439
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,360
Oh there are still more elephants.

2440
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:04,140
I don't know if it's a bad idea.

2441
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:07,200
Do you have monks still?

2442
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:07,800
Yeah.

2443
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:13,200
You have some random villagers coming in and like...

2444
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:14,280
Kill this guy!

2445
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:15,520
Kill this guy!

2446
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:16,520
Which guy?

2447
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:16,980
Which guy?

2448
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:17,460
I got him.

2449
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,560
He's trying to rebuild, but I won't let him.

2450
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:22,520
Ok, looking good!

2451
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:23,060
Looking good!

2452
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:24,980
Go attack the university.

2453
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:26,300
I should download more ram.

2454
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:28,700
Attack the university!

2455
01:38:29,740 --> 01:38:30,920
No more rams.

2456
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,680
It's a scam!

2457
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:33,180
Rams are scam!

2458
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:38,000
What is this?

2459
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:39,960
Villagers.

2460
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:43,300
You know what?

2461
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,100
I'm taking out...

2462
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:49,100
Something.

2463
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:51,720
Wait, 9 out of 10 horses in the flagged area.

2464
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:52,160
What?

2465
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:53,300
How did we lose a horse?

2466
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:58,700
I thought he was dying apparently.

2467
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,520
Close to dying, but we victoriously...

2468
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:02,380
We are victorious!

2469
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:05,720
Really?

2470
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:08,860
Was he doing so bad?

2471
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:09,680
Wait, where is he?

2472
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:13,800
He... No, he's still...

2473
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,740
He had 164 out of 450 HP.

2474
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:18,060
Where is he?

2475
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:19,060
I don't even see him.

2476
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:20,140
I don't know where you are.

2477
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:23,880
We took them down.

2478
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,840
Oh, it was right at the university.

2479
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:26,320
Wait, no.

2480
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,100
That's another villager.

2481
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:30,460
What happened with our 9 out of 10 horses in the flagged area?

2482
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:31,880
Why was it only 9?

2483
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:32,660
That's what I said.

2484
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:34,220
I don't know why it changed.

2485
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:36,240
They ate one.

2486
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:38,720
They got really desperate.

2487
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:41,160
But we won.

2488
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:42,660
So that's all that matters.

2489
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:45,280
I wololoed those elephants, baby.

2490
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:48,480
Good job!

2491
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:52,740
How many monks did you have left in the end?

2492
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,460
All 10 of them.

2493
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:57,820
Oh shit!

2494
01:39:58,140 --> 01:39:59,780
Wow, you protected them well.

2495
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:01,340
They were just chilling.

2496
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,460
I've lost a lot of guys though.

2497
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,200
Oh wait, I have even more monks.

2498
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:06,180
Because there's two here.

2499
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,460
Where did I get these monks?

2500
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:13,180
Maybe you turned them into your own monks.

2501
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:14,600
And they were someone else's too.

2502
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:15,400
Oh maybe.

2503
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:17,880
Nice!

2504
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:20,260
Oh yeah, baby.

2505
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:22,320
Attila!

2506
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,140
He was the strongest!

2507
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:27,940
I'm gonna miss our little village.

2508
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:30,000
It was nice!

2509
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:31,380
We built something nice!

2510
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,040
Even though it was very chaotic.

2511
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,840
The green place is crazy.

2512
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,200
Yeah.

2513
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,340
Oh look, their castle is so cool.

2514
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:41,480
They had more playtime.

2515
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:44,340
Yeah, I started at the feudal age.

2516
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:45,180
Like crazy.

2517
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:47,260
Now I'm castle age.

2518
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:49,500
Wait, what are they?

2519
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:52,100
There?

2520
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,120
I don't know.

2521
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:57,860
The Huns, they were like...

2522
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:01,440
They were like the USA.

2523
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:03,620
What?

2524
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:06,340
USA?

2525
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:09,980
Is that not a good comparison?

2526
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:16,200
Thank god.

2527
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:17,620
I'm glad we made it.

2528
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:20,540
I was kind of like doubting because we started so late.

2529
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:23,340
With like building our own army and stuff.

2530
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:24,880
No, we were fine.

2531
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,720
Oh, apparently not.

2532
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:30,840
My comparison was wrong.

2533
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:37,780
Well, well.

2534
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,280
So shall we move on to the next chapter?

2535
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:44,480
Or do you want to do like non-story game?

2536
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,380
What do you want to do?

2537
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:49,460
What do you want to do?

2538
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:51,080
What do you want to do?

2539
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:54,420
You...

2540
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:55,940
Oh wait, I forgot.

2541
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:56,800
We have more stories.

2542
01:41:57,900 --> 01:41:58,800
Did you read the story?

2543
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:00,660
Yeah, kind of.

2544
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:01,100
Yeah, yeah.

2545
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:03,560
In the end, so Attila was victorious.

2546
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:05,520
And then many, many people joined him.

2547
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:06,820
Like from other...

2548
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:10,100
Like the Scythians, I think the Persians too.

2549
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:10,700
The Persians?

2550
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:13,980
And even some people from the Roman Empire joined him.

2551
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:15,060
And then, you know.

2552
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,540
He had like a really...

2553
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:20,860
He had much variety in his army.

2554
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:22,580
I guess.

2555
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:27,340
Yeah, I paid attention to 50%.

2556
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:29,380
I was too excited to read, you know.

2557
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:33,260
Oh yeah, our society was great.

2558
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:34,340
Our military.

2559
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:36,000
Look at my military.

2560
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:36,980
Oh yeah, baby.

2561
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:40,480
I took down the military.

2562
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:41,880
Oh yeah, baby.

2563
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:44,900
Oh, let's go.

2564
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,180
Your military...

2565
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:49,080
The military score is like how many people you killed?

2566
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:50,160
I don't know.

2567
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:52,080
What is the military score?

2568
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:54,220
Probably, probably.

2569
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:56,860
How are the Persians so...

2570
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:58,480
The red team is like crazy though.

2571
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:00,540
Well, you know.

2572
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:03,040
This is what they mean by AI taking our jobs.

2573
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,320
Check at the top.

2574
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:07,460
10 ,000 total score.

2575
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,140
But they had way much more time to develop.

2576
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,860
We are nomads, so...

2577
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:15,300
Units created and killed.

2578
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:17,740
You...

2579
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:21,440
You raised 19 buildings.

2580
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:24,080
We both lost 0 buildings.

2581
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:24,740
Beautiful.

2582
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:26,100
Yeah, we are the best.

2583
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:29,820
You got like extra points for converting enemies.

2584
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,140
We got 6.

2585
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,040
We got 6 elephants.

2586
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,000
Ok, you had the largest army in the end.

2587
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:41,080
But I would say partially that is because I was more in the front lines and lost more.

2588
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:43,860
Oh my gosh, the Persians were crazy with their economy.

2589
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:45,980
The Persians...

2590
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:48,100
But you also were really good with your economy.

2591
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:49,400
Oh my gosh.

2592
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:51,700
I'm gonna step up my game, you know.

2593
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:52,060
I know.

2594
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:53,940
You got the economy down.

2595
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:54,180
Oh hell yeah.

2596
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:56,900
Our coin is rising.

2597
01:43:58,060 --> 01:43:58,460
Yippee!

2598
01:43:58,620 --> 01:43:59,500
Stonks, stonks!

2599
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:00,660
Stonks, stonks!

2600
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:04,300
So chat, what do you think since we can't decide?

2601
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,600
Should we do another story chapter or should we do like a skirmish?

2602
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,440
Yeah, what do you guys want?

2603
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,120
Tell me what you want, what you really, really want.

2604
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:14,200
No, tell me what you want, what you really, really want.

2605
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:18,120
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna...

2606
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:23,720
Oh, we all have castles.

2607
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:25,000
Wait, I never saw their castle.

2608
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:26,520
Did you see their castle in the end?

2609
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:29,440
No, I didn't, because it did say we had castles in it.

2610
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:31,040
I didn't see it though.

2611
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:33,120
Maybe it just looks different.

2612
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:34,460
Skirmish, skirmish, skirmish.

2613
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:36,380
1v1?

2614
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:36,840
1v1?

2615
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,700
They want 1v1 skirmish.

2616
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:40,760
You versus me.

2617
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:43,680
Alright.

2618
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:45,640
1v1?

2619
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,580
Are you scared?

2620
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:48,280
Yeah.

2621
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:49,240
Yeah.

2622
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:50,460
Me too though.

2623
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:51,740
It's no...

2624
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:55,140
It's no hard feelings.

2625
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:56,820
It's just, you know...

2626
01:44:56,820 --> 01:44:57,180
Yeah.

2627
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,480
Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, yeah.

2628
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:03,340
Some people are saying 2v2.

2629
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:09,920
Us versus AI or both of us partner up with one AI?

2630
01:45:10,420 --> 01:45:13,340
Yeah, which is it?

2631
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:13,920
2v2?

2632
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:16,520
I think we together should fight the AI.

2633
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:18,060
I think I would prefer that.

2634
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,280
I'm scared.

2635
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:21,900
If I fight you, I'm scared.

2636
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:25,200
Yeah, yeah.

2637
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:29,280
You should be, but I would also be panicking, don't worry.

2638
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:33,180
Okay, okay.

2639
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:34,940
Us versus two AI.

2640
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:35,620
Let's do that.

2641
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:36,820
I'm gonna make a room.

2642
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:42,980
It's gonna be fun.

2643
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:45,060
2v1 hard AI?

2644
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:45,980
Oh my god.

2645
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,100
No, no, no, no, normal, normal, normal.

2646
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:52,940
They said that we could take like, us versus one...

2647
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:54,400
Oh wait, that's what you said.

2648
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:55,500
2v1, right?

2649
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,060
Yeah, that is reasonable apparently, but...

2650
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:00,980
If it's one hard AI...

2651
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:02,840
You wanna try?

2652
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:04,020
Challenge, challenge.

2653
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,480
Yeah, I guess, actually.

2654
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:10,340
And we wouldn't have to divide our focus, we could just...

2655
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:12,420
Yeah, I agree.

2656
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:13,080
Okay.

2657
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:16,060
It's a challenge, it's a challenge, you guys.

2658
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:18,100
Challenging.

2659
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,660
You can help us too, if you want.

2660
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:23,220
Chat, you mean?

2661
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:23,580
Yeah.

2662
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:26,440
They're already always helping us, aren't they?

2663
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:26,920
I know.

2664
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:31,660
Thank you.

2665
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:37,460
So...

2666
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:41,460
Just, chat, would you...

2667
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:45,400
Would you forgive us if we at least put the game speed on casual though?

2668
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,200
Because we're very, very slow thinkers.

2669
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:50,820
Oh, I said game speed on normal.

2670
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:56,880
I'm not sure if it was how we just played.

2671
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:58,260
If the co-op...

2672
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,960
I think the co-op game speed is different, so I can't really compare it to that.

2673
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:02,160
That's fine, that's fine.

2674
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:02,620
Okay.

2675
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:06,560
We're gonna have casual speed...

2676
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:12,340
Hard AI, resources standard... Is the rest fine?

2677
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:19,780
Random map or should we choose one?

2678
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:21,360
Did you hear that?

2679
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:23,120
No.

2680
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:24,180
Oh, I still have you muted.

2681
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:25,600
Okay, I'm unmuting you now.

2682
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:29,140
Shut up!

2683
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,560
What should I play?

2684
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:34,040
I wanna play Portuguese.

2685
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:34,840
It's 30.

2686
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,920
That should be bigger.

2687
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:44,420
Shut up!

2688
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:45,040
I'm gonna mute you!

2689
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:46,140
Okay, sorry.

2690
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:47,480
No, don't mute me!

2691
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,000
I'll be good, I'll be good!

2692
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:51,740
I'll be good, I'll be good.

2693
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:52,820
Small?

2694
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:55,100
Because we're free players.

2695
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:57,900
Okay, I'll unmute you again.

2696
01:47:58,860 --> 01:47:59,740
Don't risk it.

2697
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:00,980
Don't challenge it.

2698
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:02,560
I'm player one.

2699
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:05,560
You really wanna play Random Civilization?

2700
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:06,580
Probably because...

2701
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:07,340
Yeah, I like it.

2702
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:11,580
I like to... I don't know a lot about any of them, so I'm just kind of...

2703
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:14,600
Let's see what you'll get.

2704
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:17,700
I hope it has good synergy with me.

2705
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:24,280
Wait, we're not together in the same team right now.

2706
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:24,920
Now we are, right?

2707
01:48:25,060 --> 01:48:26,520
Oh, I made it to Portuguese?

2708
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:28,240
Oh, wait, I think...

2709
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:28,960
Do you have to be?

2710
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:32,040
No, I think we just have to be... So change your team on the right side.

2711
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:34,040
The team's gotta be the same.

2712
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:34,320
Okay.

2713
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:38,160
Oh, I was player one.

2714
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:39,780
I was player...

2715
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:43,660
Wait, how do I get the invite... How do I invite the AI?

2716
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:44,840
I want green.

2717
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:48,360
Won't it, like, automatically add the AI?

2718
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:52,460
Oh, um... I don't know how to add it.

2719
01:48:58,340 --> 01:49:00,200
I'm not gonna invite AI, right?

2720
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:01,760
Click on open.

2721
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:02,460
Open?

2722
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:04,580
Open, open...

2723
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:04,880
Open.

2724
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:06,740
Oh, here.

2725
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:07,640
See?

2726
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:09,640
Under my name, under my name.

2727
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:20,820
And then I think you have to do for the next... Oh wait, oh yeah, because it's the hard one.

2728
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:23,320
Okay, wait.

2729
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:24,800
What colors are there?

2730
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:25,640
Pink...

2731
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:26,300
Oh, there's orange.

2732
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,440
Okay, I'm orange.

2733
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:28,380
I'm green.

2734
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:29,220
Maybe there's turquoise.

2735
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:33,620
Aren't you more like minty turquoisey?

2736
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:34,020
That's okay.

2737
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:35,240
I can be green.

2738
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:37,860
Oh, okay.

2739
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:43,480
I recently saw you kind of be more blue than mint colored.

2740
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:47,760
Oh, that was a mistake.

2741
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:50,840
Mistakes were made.

2742
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:52,780
But it was refreshing.

2743
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:54,840
I can be purple too.

2744
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:57,220
Oh, you can be anything.

2745
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:58,860
Can you be orange though?

2746
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:01,320
Oh, maybe.

2747
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:03,940
I want you to try.

2748
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:05,660
Okay, I'll be kind of orange.

2749
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:08,020
Wait, my hair...

2750
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:12,260
If I do my hair orange, I already have the mint tips.

2751
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,980
So I would look like cosplaying you.

2752
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,360
No way.

2753
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:18,180
Are you doing it right now?

2754
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:20,020
No, it would take a long time.

2755
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:21,580
Okay, okay, okay.

2756
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:23,100
Alright, alright.

2757
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,800
Let's do this.

2758
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:26,400
Let's do this!

2759
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:30,660
Unless anybody in the chat has one more...

2760
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:35,340
One more idea for what to change in the settings.

2761
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:37,340
Random map.

2762
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,400
I wonder if it's a shitty map.

2763
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:41,880
You should do a bigger map.

2764
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:44,680
Too large.

2765
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:46,400
Ah, location is what I meant.

2766
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,220
The arena, should we do arena?

2767
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:49,240
Large?

2768
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:49,960
What's arena?

2769
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:51,880
I'll do medium arena.

2770
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:54,160
Arena is quite popular.

2771
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:56,680
But I guess arena starts with walls.

2772
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:58,840
I don't really want walls from the get-go.

2773
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:01,440
Although, next one is a bit easier for us beginners.

2774
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,060
We already have walls.

2775
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:05,900
It's okay, it's okay.

2776
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:10,280
Arena starts with walls, yeah.

2777
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:11,820
Allow cheats?

2778
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:15,540
We can give ourselves cars.

2779
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:16,680
You know what?

2780
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:18,840
If we end up kinda like...

2781
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:19,840
Starting to lose...

2782
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,780
Our last resort can be using cheats.

2783
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:23,300
Okay.

2784
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:27,000
Okay, let's do Arabia.

2785
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:30,180
And...

2786
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:33,040
Is medium size really okay?

2787
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:35,460
It says for 4 players.

2788
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:37,720
We're gonna have 3 players though.

2789
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,820
But they're basically like 2 players.

2790
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:43,260
Yeah...

2791
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:45,680
I guess he'll be booming a lot.

2792
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:46,660
More than us maybe.

2793
01:51:47,020 --> 01:51:47,880
We gotta be strong.

2794
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,560
We'll be strong, we'll be strong, yeah.

2795
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:52,660
Wait, I don't think you turned on the cheats though.

2796
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:53,820
Oh!

2797
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:56,940
Is it here?

2798
01:51:58,420 --> 01:51:59,400
Allow cheats, there we go.

2799
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:00,700
Turbo mode.

2800
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:01,800
What is turbo mode?

2801
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:07,700
No, we don't need anything here.

2802
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:10,260
You guys are setting up, stop being impatient.

2803
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,720
Sorry, sorry, sorry, I'm scared.

2804
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:13,740
I'm stalling.

2805
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:14,840
No, don't be scared.

2806
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:17,000
The AI is ready, I'm ready.

2807
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:17,620
What about you?

2808
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:18,580
Oh, I was ready.

2809
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:19,900
I clicked ready earlier.

2810
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:21,600
Now you're really ready.

2811
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:23,300
What you gonna be?

2812
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:23,960
What you gonna be?

2813
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,060
I don't know, it's so exciting.

2814
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:25,920
I love the gacha.

2815
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:27,340
Gacha, gacha.

2816
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:28,300
Hindustanis.

2817
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:29,900
Hindustanis.

2818
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:31,560
Hindustanis.

2819
01:52:31,740 --> 01:52:32,960
Oh, yeah.

2820
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:35,220
And then we have Ethiopians.

2821
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:36,460
Ethiopians.

2822
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:38,020
Alrighty.

2823
01:52:38,220 --> 01:52:38,380
OK.

2824
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:40,480
Let's take them down.

2825
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:41,040
Bring it on.

2826
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:42,380
Let's take them down.

2827
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,080
Wait, I have camels.

2828
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:47,440
Alright, alright.

2829
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:51,800
Hard mode is probably gonna be like they're constantly gonna send small raids.

2830
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:52,740
Wait, what do you mean?

2831
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:58,000
OK, first thing you do, select your scout and then go auto scout.

2832
01:52:58,160 --> 01:52:59,040
Yeah, yeah, I just had him run.

2833
01:52:59,160 --> 01:52:59,680
I just had him run.

2834
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:01,700
Wait, you're so far from me.

2835
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:04,100
It's OK.

2836
01:53:04,420 --> 01:53:06,060
Maybe he'll be sandwiched between us.

2837
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:06,440
It's good.

2838
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,660
We can attack him from both sides.

2839
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:09,400
I hope he attacks you instead of me.

2840
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:10,040
I'm looking for stone.

2841
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:10,640
I found stone.

2842
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:10,880
OK.

2843
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:14,880
Oh, we got turkeys.

2844
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:15,700
I got turkeys.

2845
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:17,660
Yeah, I have turkeys too.

2846
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:24,060
I'm gonna make another villager.

2847
01:53:24,700 --> 01:53:25,620
Guys, I'm scared.

2848
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:27,480
Me too.

2849
01:53:28,060 --> 01:53:29,960
But don't yell at us to do what to do.

2850
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:30,660
Or at least not me.

2851
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:31,920
You can yell at Chiara if she wants.

2852
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:37,160
I'm just gonna play the game.

2853
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:41,080
If I lose because of you, girl.

2854
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:42,500
We're so over.

2855
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,640
No, you won't.

2856
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:44,720
I'm gonna build houses.

2857
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:46,820
Yes, me too, me too.

2858
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:51,000
And then my other guy will start mining gold.

2859
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:53,940
Gold already?

2860
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:55,420
I need more units.

2861
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:56,760
Make sure you got food.

2862
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:57,780
Are you killing the turkeys?

2863
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,260
Yeah, they're killing the turkeys.

2864
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:02,600
I got one person on each thing except gold.

2865
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:03,700
But I'll get gold.

2866
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:05,140
Lucky AI?

2867
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:05,740
Why lucky?

2868
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,080
Because they're being sandwiched or because we're easy targets?

2869
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:09,700
I see your turkey.

2870
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:12,220
Yeah, they're cute.

2871
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:14,440
They have orange tips.

2872
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:22,240
I refuse.

2873
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,060
This is my first time on hard mode.

2874
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:27,000
Crazy.

2875
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,960
Wow, look at her using the CTRL key.

2876
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:33,680
What are you using?

2877
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:35,460
Oh, I need more wood.

2878
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,300
CTRL is what I'm using.

2879
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,360
She's in control.

2880
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:43,660
Is this a tree?

2881
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:44,440
That's a tree.

2882
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:46,300
It's small, right?

2883
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:47,080
It's like a little bush.

2884
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:49,500
I didn't even realize I could get that.

2885
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:50,440
Yeah, it's kinda weird.

2886
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:52,900
Where the hell are the rest of the trees?

2887
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:58,500
My scout is coming straight to you.

2888
01:54:59,240 --> 01:54:59,520
Really?

2889
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,100
Be nice to him.

2890
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,160
I'm gonna give him a rude awakening.

2891
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:11,660
I'm scared.

2892
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:18,300
We're currently leading in... No, we're not.

2893
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:19,980
You're leading in resources.

2894
01:55:20,740 --> 01:55:25,560
But we're not so far from him, so, you know, he's like still... We're on the same level.

2895
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:26,960
OK, we're on the same level.

2896
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,680
Alright, I'm gonna build an outpost out here.

2897
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:33,080
More trees.

2898
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:36,740
I need to mark it to see your ally.

2899
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:41,600
I guess I'll do a little...

2900
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:44,220
Because I see the gold, I'll do a mining camp.

2901
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:48,580
Here's some stone.

2902
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:49,760
I wonder how much.

2903
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:50,440
You know what?

2904
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:52,440
Just build... Give me two more men.

2905
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:57,460
It's OK!

2906
01:55:58,040 --> 01:55:59,600
Don't worry, don't worry.

2907
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:02,080
Alright, this is my dedicated builder man.

2908
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:07,020
More, more, more.

2909
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:08,400
We need more villagers.

2910
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:09,500
Wait, give me some turkeys.

2911
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:11,800
Oh my god, he's already so far!

2912
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:12,580
What do you mean?

2913
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:15,060
We're allies, we're allies, so...

2914
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:16,500
How do you know he's already so far?

2915
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:21,760
Because he got... OK, he's not that much further, but he's leading in resources now.

2916
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,020
On the bottom right, you can see.

2917
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:24,460
On the bottom right?

2918
01:56:25,140 --> 01:56:27,240
It's not that bad, I guess.

2919
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:28,880
How do you... Oh, show score.

2920
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:31,780
Oh, you don't care?

2921
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:32,980
Yakuno!

2922
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:35,400
That guy's scary, Yakuno.

2923
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:38,420
OK, I got men, I got men.

2924
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,580
Alright, you start doing that.

2925
01:56:43,220 --> 01:56:44,420
Alright, let's build a mill.

2926
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:45,500
Wait, no.

2927
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:46,880
I don't need that right now.

2928
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:48,280
Wait, I mean, I will.

2929
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,380
I don't have any... What's it called around by me?

2930
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:56,640
Any water.

2931
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,940
But we're not fishing in this game.

2932
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:03,600
In this map, there's probably no fish at all.

2933
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:11,440
What's another dark age building?

2934
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:15,980
Like mining camp and stuff?

2935
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:16,880
Yeah, I have that.

2936
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:17,560
Did you build that?

2937
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:18,760
I have that.

2938
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:21,040
I guess the mill?

2939
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:23,260
Yeah.

2940
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:24,740
The barracks?

2941
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:25,800
Oh, did you build that?

2942
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:27,060
Oh no.

2943
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:28,740
Oh no, I need more wood.

2944
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:29,220
OK.

2945
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:34,840
Tiny water.

2946
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:36,180
Lumber camp.

2947
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:37,840
Oh, lumber camp!

2948
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:38,460
Thank you, guys.

2949
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:41,880
Let's see.

2950
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:43,120
Actually, you do it here.

2951
01:57:43,540 --> 01:57:44,780
And then you...

2952
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:45,320
Wait, no.

2953
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:45,800
Lumber.

2954
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:47,000
Lumber camp, right here.

2955
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:48,500
Build a house.

2956
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:52,940
OK,

2957
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:57,520
OK.

2958
01:57:57,700 --> 01:57:59,100
Mill, mill, when?

2959
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:00,800
Come on, wood, come on!

2960
01:58:01,180 --> 01:58:02,480
I'll send one more to wood.

2961
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:06,420
OK.

2962
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,220
I need more resources.

2963
01:58:09,580 --> 01:58:09,840
Oh!

2964
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:10,820
Oh my god!

2965
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:11,460
There's your guy!

2966
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:12,680
I see him.

2967
01:58:12,820 --> 01:58:13,660
And he's gone.

2968
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:16,220
Build order.

2969
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:18,820
Oh my god, I haven't thought about that in a long time.

2970
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:20,160
Build order?

2971
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:21,080
There's a build order?

2972
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:25,900
You should aim to already advance into the next age after you have 12 villagers.

2973
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:27,120
I have 13 now.

2974
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:28,620
I'm not ready, bruh.

2975
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:30,620
OK, I'll get two more.

2976
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:35,160
I'll get two more and then I'll...

2977
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:36,400
Oh, I need a lot more food.

2978
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:41,520
I need way more food.

2979
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:42,780
Where are my turkeys at?

2980
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:45,880
Maybe they're already eaten?

2981
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:46,940
Mine are all eaten.

2982
01:58:48,860 --> 01:58:50,880
Mine are almost all eaten, yeah.

2983
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:54,040
OK, time for...

2984
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:55,900
AI will go futile in a few minutes.

2985
01:58:57,460 --> 01:58:59,040
We gotta speed up.

2986
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:00,800
I need more food.

2987
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:02,800
I have an AI scout!

2988
01:59:03,260 --> 01:59:04,500
He's a scout in my area.

2989
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:06,400
Ignore him.

2990
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:06,860
He's fine.

2991
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:07,540
You can do that.

2992
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:09,880
He can't do that.

2993
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:10,820
I won't let him.

2994
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:11,460
He can't.

2995
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:12,460
No, he can't.

2996
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:13,080
No, he can't.

2997
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:13,660
He stopped.

2998
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:15,520
He stopped in front of my guys.

2999
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:19,300
He's taunting you.

3000
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:20,480
Yeah, he really was.

3001
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:22,820
I have all three scouts in my village.

3002
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:23,840
Please, can we...

3003
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:25,840
Can we give me some space here?

3004
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:30,040
I can stay with you.

3005
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:30,680
No!

3006
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:33,320
There's a tent over there.

3007
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:36,060
He was just looking at me.

3008
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:36,960
You guys saw that, right?

3009
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:38,520
Menacingly.

3010
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:41,020
OK, bye scout.

3011
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:41,320
Oh!

3012
01:59:41,580 --> 01:59:43,640
I found a relic.

3013
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:45,140
Oh!

3014
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:47,280
But you can... Just ignore it for now.

3015
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:48,920
But remember its location.

3016
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:50,060
It's right next to me.

3017
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,200
That's your relic.

3018
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:54,120
It's made for you.

3019
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:55,000
It's made for me.

3020
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:55,800
Just for you.

3021
01:59:58,400 --> 01:59:58,920
OK.

3022
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:00,880
I'm...

3023
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:03,640
Getting there to...

3024
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:05,600
I'm like...

3025
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:09,580
Almost halfway to be able to go to feudal.

3026
02:00:10,860 --> 02:00:11,340
Really?

3027
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:11,820
Wow.

3028
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:13,280
Maybe I should...

3029
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:14,300
Is that a panther?

3030
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:17,320
We got panthers in these woods.

3031
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:20,160
He might attack you if you get too close to him.

3032
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:21,500
I'm ignoring him.

3033
02:00:22,820 --> 02:00:23,700
More food.

3034
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:24,420
More food.

3035
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:24,900
OK.

3036
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,220
I'm just gonna make more people.

3037
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:28,720
One more time.

3038
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:30,140
We need more food.

3039
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:32,260
No choice.

3040
02:00:32,380 --> 02:00:32,780
No choice.

3041
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:33,820
Need more food production.

3042
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:34,740
Faster food production.

3043
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:35,420
Faster food.

3044
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:36,220
Faster food.

3045
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:38,020
We need the upgrades.

3046
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:40,460
Are we not doing so badly on resources?

3047
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:42,040
Not so bad.

3048
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:42,960
Not so bad.

3049
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:44,060
I'm lagging.

3050
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:44,720
I'm sorry.

3051
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:45,320
Oh my gosh.

3052
02:00:45,380 --> 02:00:46,020
They're going crazy.

3053
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:48,500
We're doing pretty well.

3054
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:49,940
Oh, but he suddenly...

3055
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:51,380
He's in the feudal.

3056
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:53,060
He's in the feudal woods.

3057
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:55,020
Time to panic.

3058
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:56,360
We're panicking.

3059
02:00:56,540 --> 02:00:57,120
We're panicking.

3060
02:00:57,780 --> 02:00:58,780
Should we make more?

3061
02:00:58,840 --> 02:00:59,980
I want to keep the food.

3062
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:02,400
Oh no.

3063
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:02,880
No.

3064
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:03,380
No.

3065
02:01:03,380 --> 02:01:05,200
I wish I had more turkey.

3066
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:06,460
OK.

3067
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:09,780
I guess the boar will get more.

3068
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:11,880
Come on lady.

3069
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:12,700
Get that turkey.

3070
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:13,880
Get that turkey.

3071
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:19,660
Yeah, actually, let's send him to the turkey...

3072
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:21,240
to help her out.

3073
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:23,480
And then...

3074
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:23,800
OK.

3075
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:25,480
Multiple people on turkey.

3076
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:26,300
Turkey duty.

3077
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:30,200
Kill him.

3078
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:30,580
Kill him.

3079
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:31,060
Go get him.

3080
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:33,620
He can go back to the farms.

3081
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:37,860
Don't let him die.

3082
02:01:39,860 --> 02:01:40,660
He's dying.

3083
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:42,520
So close.

3084
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:43,800
You have people dying already?

3085
02:01:44,580 --> 02:01:46,480
I had a villager die from a boar.

3086
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:47,360
But it's OK.

3087
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:52,040
My scout is not going very far.

3088
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:56,960
What's the ETA of a small army attack?

3089
02:01:57,600 --> 02:01:58,420
Do I want to know?

3090
02:01:58,580 --> 02:01:59,340
Do I want to know?

3091
02:01:59,440 --> 02:01:59,500
No.

3092
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:00,220
Don't say that.

3093
02:02:00,820 --> 02:02:03,460
I need to build... Should I build a barrack?

3094
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:04,360
Now?

3095
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:05,660
You can't, right?

3096
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:07,880
Until we get to feudal?

3097
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:09,380
No, I can't.

3098
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:09,800
I can't.

3099
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:11,200
It only costs wood.

3100
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:14,600
Is he up or down?

3101
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:15,060
I wonder.

3102
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:16,460
I have another turkey.

3103
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:18,220
I'm going to feudal!

3104
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,040
You're going to feudal?

3105
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:25,400
I'm going to feudal!

3106
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:28,760
She's going to feudal.

3107
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:30,800
I'm going to feudal!

3108
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:33,000
I'm going to make another man.

3109
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:34,880
Yeah, we're on to the side door.

3110
02:02:36,540 --> 02:02:37,420
For now.

3111
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:41,620
Where's my scout?

3112
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:44,100
Do I still have a scout?

3113
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:46,600
Yeah, he's got to be around, right?

3114
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:48,840
Mine is just in the corner.

3115
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:51,060
Mine is exploring areas he's explored before.

3116
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:52,060
Wait a second.

3117
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:53,300
Can I get these deer?

3118
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:55,000
I think he's dead.

3119
02:02:56,680 --> 02:02:58,280
What are you guys doing so far?

3120
02:02:58,280 --> 02:02:59,140
Can I get these deer?

3121
02:03:02,220 --> 02:03:02,660
No.

3122
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:03,240
Dang it.

3123
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:04,340
He's fast.

3124
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:05,860
I didn't think he would be so fast.

3125
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:06,280
Oh no.

3126
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:09,900
Did I get my guy yet?

3127
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:13,420
He's still researching.

3128
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:13,840
That's why.

3129
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:16,260
Here we go.

3130
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:18,440
I'm at 70% almost.

3131
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:21,940
I thought it would shoot.

3132
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:23,900
I thought my town center would shoot at him.

3133
02:03:26,680 --> 02:03:27,420
Girl, help!

3134
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:27,720
Help!

3135
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:27,880
Help!

3136
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:29,220
Wait, are you dying?

3137
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:30,720
No, no!

3138
02:03:31,580 --> 02:03:32,880
I'm doing stupid things.

3139
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:37,800
Ok, this will be fine.

3140
02:03:42,020 --> 02:03:43,400
How did that happen?

3141
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:44,860
Oh, feudal age.

3142
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:45,100
Ok.

3143
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:46,620
I'm feudaling.

3144
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:52,460
I just saw... I couldn't see what was going on.

3145
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:55,260
Except I could see that the boar was attacking.

3146
02:03:55,580 --> 02:03:56,700
Wait, can you eat the boar?

3147
02:03:57,460 --> 02:03:57,940
Yeah.

3148
02:03:58,620 --> 02:04:00,480
I think they bring a good amount of meat.

3149
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:02,280
It's more efficient than berries probably.

3150
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:07,620
So you wanna make sure that you've got somebody.

3151
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:09,200
Do you think I should try it, guys?

3152
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:10,140
Should I try it?

3153
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:12,340
At first you should give them loom.

3154
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:13,900
You should upgrade to loom.

3155
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:17,940
Otherwise, you know...

3156
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,000
They will probably die easily from the attacks.

3157
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:26,700
And you could try baiting the boar closer to your town center and stuff like that.

3158
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:30,620
There's all kinds of tactics, but it's probably too complicated for a beginner.

3159
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:33,740
She called me dumb, you guys.

3160
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:36,300
No, no, no, no!

3161
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:37,360
I mean...

3162
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:39,620
You know how it is.

3163
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:46,620
Ok, this will be the outskirts right here.

3164
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:51,640
I still have this one berry bush.

3165
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:53,780
Maybe that wasn't a jaguar.

3166
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:55,260
Maybe that was a bear.

3167
02:04:55,580 --> 02:04:55,900
A boar.

3168
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:58,240
Could be.

3169
02:04:58,640 --> 02:04:59,140
Yeah, right.

3170
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,600
I don't think... Is there a jaguar on this map?

3171
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:04,720
Oh, it looks like a jaguar from the front.

3172
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:05,400
Yeah, you're right.

3173
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:06,520
It's not a jaguar.

3174
02:05:07,720 --> 02:05:13,480
I think jaguars are more, you know, cat-like usually.

3175
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:15,560
True.

3176
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:17,100
Ok.

3177
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:19,540
We have a long tail.

3178
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:23,640
Alright, I'm building buildings.

3179
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:24,500
I'm building buildings.

3180
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:26,180
Getting the buildings in.

3181
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:32,960
Alright, time to start getting some militia.

3182
02:05:33,860 --> 02:05:34,400
Oh yeah!

3183
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:35,820
Yeah?

3184
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:36,440
Yeah.

3185
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:38,460
Should I too?

3186
02:05:38,540 --> 02:05:41,260
I should maybe too, but I'm so lacking food.

3187
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:42,280
Ah, me too now.

3188
02:05:44,140 --> 02:05:47,080
Stop making fun of the way I say jaguar.

3189
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:59,960
You know, last night... Speaking of cats, can I share this little tangent?

3190
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:00,900
I was so excited.

3191
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:05,340
Last night I... Where are these guys going?

3192
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:13,700
Last night, my cat's movie, she's like looking out of, you know, those windows that are like doors.

3193
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:15,100
So tall, tall windows.

3194
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:16,600
So it goes onto the floor.

3195
02:06:16,980 --> 02:06:16,980
Yeah?

3196
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:17,280
Yeah?

3197
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:21,720
And I was like, oh, what is she looking at?

3198
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:23,220
It was late at night, you know?

3199
02:06:24,100 --> 02:06:26,240
I know where the... Wait, I know where the red team is.

3200
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:29,040
Oh, below us.

3201
02:06:29,060 --> 02:06:29,660
Ok, ok.

3202
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:31,280
They're being sandwiched.

3203
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:31,960
Good, good, good.

3204
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:33,300
Anyway, sorry.

3205
02:06:33,580 --> 02:06:33,900
Your cat?

3206
02:06:34,220 --> 02:06:34,360
Yeah.

3207
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:41,060
So, it was late in the night and Smoovie, my cat, was noticing something outside in the dark.

3208
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:47,660
And she was sitting in front of the window door and loafing in front of it and looking outside.

3209
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:52,140
And I saw, because it was so dark, it looked like a silhouette of something.

3210
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:55,140
And I thought it was just a reflection of Smoovie.

3211
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:57,640
But I looked closer and I'm like, eh?

3212
02:06:58,480 --> 02:06:59,480
Maybe a reflection?

3213
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:01,060
I'm getting attacked!

3214
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:02,920
You're panicking again.

3215
02:07:04,740 --> 02:07:05,500
You good?

3216
02:07:06,020 --> 02:07:06,840
I'm getting attacked!

3217
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:08,160
You good?

3218
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:08,740
You good?

3219
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:09,760
Oh my god!

3220
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:13,440
You're getting so muted from Discord because you're screaming.

3221
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:14,960
I'm getting attacked!

3222
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:16,920
Oh my god, there's a lot of them!

3223
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:20,680
I can't see the action!

3224
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:23,740
Did he actually come for you?

3225
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:24,200
Yes!

3226
02:07:24,980 --> 02:07:25,260
No!

3227
02:07:27,020 --> 02:07:28,420
Ok, I need to prepare then.

3228
02:07:28,540 --> 02:07:30,740
I need to prepare because maybe he'll attack me soon too.

3229
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:35,080
But he won't send two teams at once, right?

3230
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:35,860
You're first.

3231
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:37,520
At least you already have...

3232
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:38,060
I'm in my zone!

3233
02:07:38,420 --> 02:07:38,880
You had some?

3234
02:07:39,300 --> 02:07:41,360
No, I didn't finish up making them yet!

3235
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:42,880
Oh my god, there's a lot of them!

3236
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:44,620
There's a whole lot of them!

3237
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:48,040
Get your... maybe your villagers can help.

3238
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:49,440
Or garrison them.

3239
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:52,240
What does your chat say to you?

3240
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:53,600
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing!

3241
02:07:55,540 --> 02:07:56,700
This is the garrison, right?

3242
02:07:56,820 --> 02:07:57,540
What does garrison mean?

3243
02:07:57,620 --> 02:07:59,620
Yeah, I think so.

3244
02:08:00,620 --> 02:08:01,680
I'm here too now.

3245
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:03,640
Oh my gosh, there's a lot of them!

3246
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:05,620
How did chat think we could handle this?

3247
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,460
There's a lot of them, Kyo!

3248
02:08:10,860 --> 02:08:14,340
I'm still making more enemies, but they're very...

3249
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:15,860
Oh, they don't stand a chance.

3250
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:16,540
Oh my god.

3251
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:18,400
Um...

3252
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,740
Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat!

3253
02:08:22,860 --> 02:08:24,440
No, no, no, no!

3254
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:38,300
See, this is the point where I also usually get overwhelmed when the AI rushes at me early.

3255
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:41,960
Oh, they just took out that.

3256
02:08:42,140 --> 02:08:46,240
Because they get me as a... what's it called?

3257
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:50,160
With their archers before I can even reach them.

3258
02:08:50,820 --> 02:08:51,620
My guys are dead.

3259
02:08:52,220 --> 02:08:52,480
No!

3260
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:54,660
Don't attack me, please!

3261
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:59,440
Then garrison even the ones that you're currently making.

3262
02:08:59,540 --> 02:09:00,140
Attack, attack!

3263
02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:01,600
I think you can do that, right?

3264
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:05,440
But the militia that you are creating, keep them inside of the barracks.

3265
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:06,020
Is that a thing?

3266
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:09,360
And just horde them, horde them...

3267
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:10,520
I don't know, actually.

3268
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:11,720
He's in Castle H!

3269
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:13,820
We're so fucked!

3270
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:15,100
No, we're not fucked.

3271
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:16,020
No, we are fucked.

3272
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:18,360
Yeah, I think we're pretty... I think it's over.

3273
02:09:18,900 --> 02:09:21,580
I can't make anything because I have no people making food.

3274
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:22,740
I can't do anything.

3275
02:09:22,980 --> 02:09:23,420
Cheat, cheat!

3276
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:24,800
How do I cheat?

3277
02:09:24,860 --> 02:09:25,440
What's a cheat?

3278
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:26,920
How do we cheat?

3279
02:09:27,020 --> 02:09:28,600
I think you just type in something in the chat.

3280
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:32,480
I think we need to... she needs to cheat a little bit, otherwise it's so over.

3281
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:34,600
What's the car cheat?

3282
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:36,060
Or what's a good one?

3283
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:38,940
The goat is so funny or whatever that was.

3284
02:09:39,900 --> 02:09:41,780
What is how do you...

3285
02:09:41,780 --> 02:09:42,780
What is that?

3286
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:44,520
How do I turn this on?

3287
02:09:44,740 --> 02:09:45,240
What is that?

3288
02:09:46,020 --> 02:09:48,420
How do I turn this on?

3289
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:50,400
That was something, yeah.

3290
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:51,060
What did I do?

3291
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:53,180
Did that spawn something?

3292
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:55,020
I don't think so.

3293
02:09:56,020 --> 02:09:57,660
Goodbye, goodbye.

3294
02:09:58,600 --> 02:09:59,540
What goodbye?

3295
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:00,140
What goodbye?

3296
02:10:00,420 --> 02:10:00,800
What goodbye?

3297
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,660
It's ok, just let it play.

3298
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:04,460
What's playing?

3299
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:05,200
Oh wait, what?

3300
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:06,320
Are you dead?

3301
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:07,040
Don't die!

3302
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:09,460
How do you turn this on?

3303
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:10,000
What?

3304
02:10:10,060 --> 02:10:10,980
Oh, how do...

3305
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:14,360
How do you turn this on?

3306
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:18,800
What did I do?

3307
02:10:19,820 --> 02:10:20,460
With spaces.

3308
02:10:20,620 --> 02:10:21,400
Oh, how do...

3309
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:23,620
Why did you all send it with one word then?

3310
02:10:24,180 --> 02:10:25,200
Turn this on.

3311
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:27,320
Huh?

3312
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:29,480
Oh wait, sorry, you.

3313
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:31,300
How do you...

3314
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:35,160
I have a car!

3315
02:10:39,970 --> 02:10:43,310
They were sending...but they were sending it...

3316
02:10:43,310 --> 02:10:46,010
Everybody was sending it with one word.

3317
02:10:47,150 --> 02:10:47,870
Oh my god!

3318
02:10:50,770 --> 02:10:52,910
Oh my god, they are still coming after me.

3319
02:10:53,610 --> 02:10:54,770
They are so intense.

3320
02:10:55,030 --> 02:10:56,070
Ok, everybody come out.

3321
02:10:56,250 --> 02:10:58,250
Back to work, like nothing ever happened.

3322
02:10:58,250 --> 02:11:01,370
What happened?

3323
02:11:02,130 --> 02:11:03,310
We are ok.

3324
02:11:04,330 --> 02:11:05,930
Type in Alpaca Simulator.

3325
02:11:06,270 --> 02:11:06,450
What?

3326
02:11:07,870 --> 02:11:08,730
Get Ten Guide.

3327
02:11:08,830 --> 02:11:10,770
I seriously got Ten Guide for real.

3328
02:11:11,490 --> 02:11:12,190
Like everybody...

3329
02:11:12,190 --> 02:11:13,910
No, it sounds familiar.

3330
02:11:14,070 --> 02:11:14,650
I think it's real.

3331
02:11:15,770 --> 02:11:18,870
No, no, everybody was sending it to me with no spaces.

3332
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:20,370
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

3333
02:11:23,610 --> 02:11:24,930
Yay, I got a car.

3334
02:11:25,030 --> 02:11:25,830
I'm coming over to you.

3335
02:11:26,590 --> 02:11:28,350
I'm gonna show you my sick ride.

3336
02:11:29,170 --> 02:11:30,310
Oh, you got the car!

3337
02:11:32,370 --> 02:11:35,930
Girl, rebuild your economy.

3338
02:11:36,130 --> 02:11:36,790
They are working on it.

3339
02:11:36,790 --> 02:11:37,310
I need food.

3340
02:11:38,170 --> 02:11:38,350
Ok.

3341
02:11:39,150 --> 02:11:41,590
Don't show off your car if you don't have...

3342
02:11:41,590 --> 02:11:43,470
I'm gonna do wheelies in your fields.

3343
02:11:44,430 --> 02:11:46,590
No, you are ruining my crops.

3344
02:11:47,550 --> 02:11:48,310
Oh my god, stop!

3345
02:11:49,330 --> 02:11:50,730
What even is this?

3346
02:11:50,730 --> 02:11:51,490
I'm doing donuts.

3347
02:11:52,410 --> 02:11:53,110
I'm doing donuts.

3348
02:11:53,430 --> 02:11:53,510
Witchery!

3349
02:11:54,230 --> 02:11:54,710
Sorcery!

3350
02:11:55,930 --> 02:11:56,690
Ok, bye.

3351
02:11:56,730 --> 02:11:57,430
What is this?

3352
02:11:57,510 --> 02:11:58,210
It stinks!

3353
02:11:59,110 --> 02:12:00,230
It moves too fast.

3354
02:12:00,570 --> 02:12:01,930
My wood is gone too.

3355
02:12:02,030 --> 02:12:02,910
Everything is gone.

3356
02:12:04,770 --> 02:12:05,650
Your car!

3357
02:12:05,890 --> 02:12:07,370
You are focusing too much on your car!

3358
02:12:08,130 --> 02:12:10,130
You need to focus.

3359
02:12:12,290 --> 02:12:13,210
Rebuild, rebuild.

3360
02:12:13,290 --> 02:12:13,730
Don't give up.

3361
02:12:13,810 --> 02:12:14,470
I am rebuild.

3362
02:12:16,190 --> 02:12:17,610
Wait, can I take this guy out?

3363
02:12:18,710 --> 02:12:19,930
Oh yeah baby!

3364
02:12:20,450 --> 02:12:21,450
All the boars!

3365
02:12:21,870 --> 02:12:22,810
Oh yeah baby.

3366
02:12:22,810 --> 02:12:25,730
Where is more wood?

3367
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:28,550
This really feels like barely any wood.

3368
02:12:28,810 --> 02:12:29,450
Ok, good, good, good.

3369
02:12:34,570 --> 02:12:35,610
Wait, no, no, no.

3370
02:12:35,690 --> 02:12:36,450
You keep doing your thing.

3371
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:37,450
Keep doing your thing girlfriend.

3372
02:12:37,730 --> 02:12:39,290
I only have women left.

3373
02:12:39,450 --> 02:12:41,410
I'm a society of hot babes.

3374
02:12:42,950 --> 02:12:44,850
I won't use the car much though guys.

3375
02:12:45,050 --> 02:12:46,150
It's only for last resort.

3376
02:12:46,290 --> 02:12:48,130
In fact, I'll take him over here and kill this boar.

3377
02:12:50,670 --> 02:12:51,810
Wait, did I lose the boar?

3378
02:12:51,810 --> 02:12:53,070
Where did the boar go?

3379
02:12:54,810 --> 02:12:55,370
I'm hungry.

3380
02:12:57,850 --> 02:12:59,210
I should try exploring.

3381
02:12:59,310 --> 02:13:01,030
I don't have a scout anymore I think.

3382
02:13:01,690 --> 02:13:03,050
I'm being attacked again.

3383
02:13:03,090 --> 02:13:03,950
Wait, no he's not.

3384
02:13:04,270 --> 02:13:05,290
This is not fair.

3385
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:07,790
I didn't even have time to regenerate.

3386
02:13:11,270 --> 02:13:12,470
Who do you think you are?

3387
02:13:13,210 --> 02:13:14,050
Oh my god!

3388
02:13:14,490 --> 02:13:16,030
They are obsessed with me Chiara.

3389
02:13:17,910 --> 02:13:19,730
I'm obsessed with you too.

3390
02:13:21,030 --> 02:13:21,590
Understandable.

3391
02:13:23,750 --> 02:13:26,230
I wasn't even gonna use this.

3392
02:13:27,110 --> 02:13:29,490
Why am I so out of wood?

3393
02:13:30,790 --> 02:13:32,030
Where are they coming from?

3394
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:33,930
OK, I wanna actually play the game.

3395
02:13:36,830 --> 02:13:38,030
Not enough wood.

3396
02:13:38,230 --> 02:13:39,270
Oh, my farm is exhausted.

3397
02:13:39,830 --> 02:13:42,210
OK, let's have you build...

3398
02:13:42,210 --> 02:13:43,210
Oh, I don't have enough wood.

3399
02:13:44,090 --> 02:13:45,350
No, me neither.

3400
02:13:49,150 --> 02:13:51,110
More wood, more wood.

3401
02:13:53,090 --> 02:13:58,190
I love this lady is like doing the farm but it's like on fire.

3402
02:13:58,870 --> 02:14:03,890
So she's like taking care of the crops while it's on fire.

3403
02:14:07,330 --> 02:14:10,010
Guys, I can't really sell much of anything.

3404
02:14:11,290 --> 02:14:12,470
You have a market already?

3405
02:14:12,470 --> 02:14:13,210
Yeah.

3406
02:14:14,190 --> 02:14:14,790
Damn.

3407
02:14:15,810 --> 02:14:18,510
I need a market too so that I can see you properly.

3408
02:14:19,170 --> 02:14:20,650
I'll send my guy over.

3409
02:14:22,190 --> 02:14:24,070
But I don't have a market yet.

3410
02:14:25,030 --> 02:14:28,110
So no point in sending him over.

3411
02:14:29,090 --> 02:14:32,110
I don't even have enough wood for...

3412
02:14:32,110 --> 02:14:33,650
Oh, because I built that guy.

3413
02:14:34,290 --> 02:14:35,970
I can't make shit either.

3414
02:14:38,530 --> 02:14:41,410
Oh, you do farm please.

3415
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:44,650
I need more wood.

3416
02:14:50,710 --> 02:14:52,790
Oh, did my scout come visit you?

3417
02:14:57,350 --> 02:14:57,830
No?

3418
02:14:58,770 --> 02:14:59,010
No.

3419
02:14:59,310 --> 02:15:00,790
Maybe he did.

3420
02:15:01,970 --> 02:15:04,050
Oh, this guy still has...

3421
02:15:05,130 --> 02:15:06,870
What were you doing over there, mister?

3422
02:15:08,810 --> 02:15:09,830
He's a little confused.

3423
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:10,670
Confused.

3424
02:15:15,090 --> 02:15:16,330
Nice thumbnail, right?

3425
02:15:16,590 --> 02:15:17,330
It's art.

3426
02:15:17,690 --> 02:15:18,330
It is art.

3427
02:15:18,570 --> 02:15:20,330
It's beautiful art.

3428
02:15:22,110 --> 02:15:23,250
We got people on wood.

3429
02:15:23,330 --> 02:15:23,970
It's a little slow.

3430
02:15:24,170 --> 02:15:25,570
We're slow, but it's okay.

3431
02:15:25,690 --> 02:15:26,270
We're doing it.

3432
02:15:26,450 --> 02:15:28,130
We have the same issues, girl.

3433
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:31,290
I feel connected to you.

3434
02:15:31,470 --> 02:15:33,710
This is the real experience.

3435
02:15:35,570 --> 02:15:37,410
Okay, I'm coming to trade with you.

3436
02:15:37,470 --> 02:15:38,210
Wait, do you have a market?

3437
02:15:38,970 --> 02:15:40,290
No, I don't.

3438
02:15:41,530 --> 02:15:43,810
My priorities lie elsewhere.

3439
02:15:47,090 --> 02:15:48,950
Look at my camel.

3440
02:15:49,090 --> 02:15:49,730
He's so cute.

3441
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:53,830
He's such a cutie.

3442
02:15:56,270 --> 02:15:57,070
It's okay.

3443
02:15:57,210 --> 02:15:57,910
Don't worry.

3444
02:15:58,910 --> 02:16:00,230
Are we gonna die?

3445
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:00,850
No.

3446
02:16:02,410 --> 02:16:02,710
Maybe.

3447
02:16:02,830 --> 02:16:04,450
Is this the end of our romance?

3448
02:16:04,870 --> 02:16:07,250
Get a car if you think you're gonna die.

3449
02:16:07,250 --> 02:16:08,070
Okay.

3450
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:12,670
Thank you.

3451
02:16:19,010 --> 02:16:21,810
I think Kiara's thumbnail is superior.

3452
02:16:23,390 --> 02:16:25,050
It's pretty good, yeah.

3453
02:16:25,090 --> 02:16:26,070
Yeah, it is pretty good.

3454
02:16:26,950 --> 02:16:30,790
I mean, but I didn't draw it, so really the thanks goes to the artist.

3455
02:16:31,310 --> 02:16:32,130
Thank you, artists.

3456
02:16:32,350 --> 02:16:32,910
Thank you, artists.

3457
02:16:33,010 --> 02:16:33,930
Okay, you come over here.

3458
02:16:34,050 --> 02:16:34,830
We love you, artists.

3459
02:16:34,830 --> 02:16:37,850
We need you to build this here.

3460
02:16:37,890 --> 02:16:41,830
We need more mint and guava fan art, you know.

3461
02:16:42,130 --> 02:16:42,770
Wait, this here.

3462
02:16:47,870 --> 02:16:55,650
And Lainey, you take your stuff back and then we're gonna have you build the berries.

3463
02:16:56,590 --> 02:16:58,210
Advance to the imperial age!

3464
02:17:00,650 --> 02:17:01,050
Bro!

3465
02:17:06,390 --> 02:17:08,990
Why did anybody think that we could do this?

3466
02:17:09,290 --> 02:17:12,350
Yeah, what were you guys expecting?

3467
02:17:14,490 --> 02:17:15,990
So unrealistic!

3468
02:17:17,590 --> 02:17:18,890
We're not that good!

3469
02:17:19,690 --> 02:17:21,410
This is so funny!

3470
02:17:23,630 --> 02:17:25,830
Oh my gosh!

3471
02:17:26,310 --> 02:17:32,590
So funny, my eyes are tearing from all the fun laughter.

3472
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:38,350
This is how it would be playing with chat, you know.

3473
02:17:39,970 --> 02:17:40,690
What do I need?

3474
02:17:40,790 --> 02:17:42,450
Oh, I just need a few buildings.

3475
02:17:42,750 --> 02:17:43,470
Haha, woods.

3476
02:17:43,590 --> 02:17:44,670
Haha, it fucking takes wood!

3477
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:47,710
Wait, why is my thing all ugly now?

3478
02:17:47,930 --> 02:17:51,770
My lumber, my mill used to be so pretty and now it's ugly.

3479
02:17:52,570 --> 02:17:53,310
What happened?

3480
02:17:56,190 --> 02:17:57,310
Namaste, snake.

3481
02:18:00,230 --> 02:18:01,750
Let's get lumber upgrade.

3482
02:18:01,750 --> 02:18:03,750
Why is my Oshi not min-maxing?

3483
02:18:03,910 --> 02:18:05,390
I know, it's so true.

3484
02:18:05,970 --> 02:18:07,750
We're not, I'm trying my best.

3485
02:18:08,630 --> 02:18:09,670
I'm trying my best.

3486
02:18:11,190 --> 02:18:13,810
You got trained, I've never been trained.

3487
02:18:14,230 --> 02:18:16,330
It's been like a year or so.

3488
02:18:18,970 --> 02:18:20,010
I'm advancing.

3489
02:18:21,290 --> 02:18:22,830
I need house, shit.

3490
02:18:23,890 --> 02:18:24,830
Bro, make house.

3491
02:18:24,890 --> 02:18:26,070
Wait, I have bored people.

3492
02:18:26,650 --> 02:18:27,670
You build this.

3493
02:18:28,510 --> 02:18:30,350
You build mill right here.

3494
02:18:30,350 --> 02:18:32,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3495
02:18:32,930 --> 02:18:35,490
At least I have a watchtower, that should help a little bit.

3496
02:18:36,990 --> 02:18:37,910
Mint-maxing.

3497
02:18:40,450 --> 02:18:42,350
I could use some more wood.

3498
02:18:42,430 --> 02:18:43,510
We need more guys on wood.

3499
02:18:45,690 --> 02:18:46,610
Wait, where is my board?

3500
02:18:46,730 --> 02:18:51,350
Oh, he's bored because he's not trading with anybody because someone...

3501
02:18:53,370 --> 02:18:56,010
Well, well, well, milady.

3502
02:18:57,950 --> 02:19:01,730
Someone was about to die and vanish from this map.

3503
02:19:01,890 --> 02:19:02,970
Yeah, it's very true.

3504
02:19:03,150 --> 02:19:05,090
Maybe she shouldn't have had a market.

3505
02:19:05,510 --> 02:19:07,570
Maybe she should have had more militia.

3506
02:19:07,950 --> 02:19:08,350
What?

3507
02:19:08,610 --> 02:19:11,350
I'm trying to make militia.

3508
02:19:11,950 --> 02:19:13,370
I'm gonna make more archers then.

3509
02:19:13,570 --> 02:19:14,290
They're strong.

3510
02:19:14,430 --> 02:19:14,990
Archers are strong.

3511
02:19:15,430 --> 02:19:16,230
Oh, I don't have enough wood.

3512
02:19:16,450 --> 02:19:16,770
Dang it.

3513
02:19:17,150 --> 02:19:18,710
Why do you need wood for an archer?

3514
02:19:20,050 --> 02:19:24,510
When you click on the lumber camp, do you have any available lumber upgrades?

3515
02:19:26,010 --> 02:19:27,730
How do I click on it?

3516
02:19:27,990 --> 02:19:28,790
Oh, there it is.

3517
02:19:29,190 --> 02:19:31,090
Yeah, I have to wait for more wood.

3518
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:33,870
There we go.

3519
02:19:34,150 --> 02:19:35,450
I know, everything takes wood.

3520
02:19:37,430 --> 02:19:39,030
The infighting has started.

3521
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:40,810
It's the stress, man.

3522
02:19:40,870 --> 02:19:42,310
It's the stress of dying.

3523
02:19:42,990 --> 02:19:44,170
Of impending doom.

3524
02:19:44,770 --> 02:19:46,010
Understandable, wouldn't you say?

3525
02:19:46,130 --> 02:19:46,810
I think so.

3526
02:19:48,310 --> 02:19:50,110
Let's make everybody gather here.

3527
02:19:50,830 --> 02:19:51,490
Let's see.

3528
02:19:51,510 --> 02:19:52,710
You go get some berries.

3529
02:19:54,970 --> 02:19:56,710
Now if I kill this boar...

3530
02:20:07,610 --> 02:20:08,650
Oh no!

3531
02:20:14,050 --> 02:20:14,910
It doesn't work!

3532
02:20:16,510 --> 02:20:17,350
Hit and run!

3533
02:20:17,710 --> 02:20:18,410
Hit and run!

3534
02:20:20,970 --> 02:20:24,310
Okay, that's fine.

3535
02:20:26,030 --> 02:20:27,890
Need more houses.

3536
02:20:28,090 --> 02:20:28,870
Okay, okay.

3537
02:20:30,790 --> 02:20:35,530
And you build another house.

3538
02:20:40,190 --> 02:20:44,370
Can we even win this?

3539
02:20:45,550 --> 02:20:46,270
Yeah, we can.

3540
02:20:46,270 --> 02:20:49,410
I'm feeling optimistic.

3541
02:20:51,470 --> 02:20:54,710
It's also been a while since he attacked any of us.

3542
02:20:54,870 --> 02:20:57,410
So I wonder when is it gonna happen next.

3543
02:20:57,530 --> 02:20:58,810
And it will be me for sure, right?

3544
02:20:59,290 --> 02:21:01,870
No, I think I'm closer, so he keeps going after me.

3545
02:21:03,130 --> 02:21:05,910
Okay, you guys built that.

3546
02:21:11,890 --> 02:21:12,990
Who's my board guy?

3547
02:21:13,130 --> 02:21:15,630
Oh, the guy that once took trade.

3548
02:21:15,790 --> 02:21:17,010
He has no one to trade with.

3549
02:21:17,090 --> 02:21:17,670
So sad.

3550
02:21:20,690 --> 02:21:24,470
I'm not gonna put in cheats, guys, unless it's a desperate situation, okay?

3551
02:21:25,250 --> 02:21:26,090
No cheats.

3552
02:21:26,170 --> 02:21:28,970
We're trying to do this fair and square, unless it's desperate.

3553
02:21:29,350 --> 02:21:30,490
Oh, I'm getting attacked again.

3554
02:21:31,110 --> 02:21:31,510
Car!

3555
02:21:32,270 --> 02:21:32,670
Car!

3556
02:21:33,590 --> 02:21:35,810
Where am I getting attacked?

3557
02:21:36,270 --> 02:21:36,910
Oh, there he is.

3558
02:21:38,110 --> 02:21:39,170
Actually, hold on.

3559
02:21:39,410 --> 02:21:40,190
Maybe he can do it.

3560
02:21:40,470 --> 02:21:41,150
Maybe they can do it.

3561
02:21:41,350 --> 02:21:42,670
It's not that big of an army this time.

3562
02:21:42,990 --> 02:21:43,550
Come on, team!

3563
02:21:46,630 --> 02:21:50,210
It may not be a big army, but he's in castle age.

3564
02:21:51,350 --> 02:21:52,230
I can be castle age.

3565
02:21:52,470 --> 02:21:53,870
No, next age.

3566
02:21:55,550 --> 02:21:57,370
Next aging, whatever it is.

3567
02:21:58,010 --> 02:21:58,570
Are you okay?

3568
02:22:01,770 --> 02:22:04,490
You're dying so hard again that your Discord is muting you.

3569
02:22:05,390 --> 02:22:07,190
They're coming in with the rams!

3570
02:22:08,510 --> 02:22:09,830
With the rams?

3571
02:22:10,050 --> 02:22:12,050
There's nothing to ram over there, is there?

3572
02:22:12,090 --> 02:22:13,130
I have a place.

3573
02:22:13,490 --> 02:22:14,810
Hey, stop attacking my people.

3574
02:22:17,950 --> 02:22:21,270
I'm glad I have the car, but my car might die soon.

3575
02:22:23,310 --> 02:22:24,350
Oh my god!

3576
02:22:24,930 --> 02:22:26,650
They were really saving up.

3577
02:22:26,830 --> 02:22:28,030
Kiara, they were really saving up.

3578
02:22:28,030 --> 02:22:30,030
Kiara, they were really...

3579
02:22:30,770 --> 02:22:32,690
They are obsessed with me!

3580
02:22:32,990 --> 02:22:33,430
Oh my god!

3581
02:22:33,530 --> 02:22:33,590
No!

3582
02:22:33,890 --> 02:22:34,230
Do not!

3583
02:22:34,430 --> 02:22:34,650
Don't!

3584
02:22:35,310 --> 02:22:36,510
Get the car!

3585
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:37,510
Get another car!

3586
02:22:38,650 --> 02:22:39,450
Get another car!

3587
02:22:39,890 --> 02:22:40,870
Get two cars!

3588
02:22:41,730 --> 02:22:43,330
You need them probably.

3589
02:22:44,390 --> 02:22:47,010
Otherwise they're going to destroy everything you have and you have to rebuild again.

3590
02:22:47,310 --> 02:22:47,690
I'm okay.

3591
02:22:47,990 --> 02:22:48,430
I'm okay.

3592
02:22:48,470 --> 02:22:48,870
We're fine.

3593
02:22:49,390 --> 02:22:49,890
We're fine.

3594
02:22:50,510 --> 02:22:50,990
We're okay.

3595
02:22:51,330 --> 02:22:52,270
Yeah, we're okay.

3596
02:22:52,270 --> 02:22:58,030
Actually, oh my gosh, we killed the guy on the farms and it's adding like...

3597
02:22:58,030 --> 02:23:03,190
His decaying body is fertilizing the fields.

3598
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:06,630
Did they kill these guys too?

3599
02:23:07,330 --> 02:23:08,730
Are you close to castling?

3600
02:23:19,290 --> 02:23:20,910
They're still attacking me.

3601
02:23:20,910 --> 02:23:22,650
Oh my gosh, get him!

3602
02:23:23,210 --> 02:23:24,030
Get the wall alone!

3603
02:23:29,660 --> 02:23:31,100
They're still attacking me.

3604
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:31,640
It's okay.

3605
02:23:31,820 --> 02:23:32,940
Oh my gosh, they're still...

3606
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:33,660
Come on, please!

3607
02:23:34,180 --> 02:23:35,360
Leave me alone!

3608
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:37,820
Leave me alone, please!

3609
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:39,400
Leave me alone!

3610
02:23:40,400 --> 02:23:42,220
I'm just one car!

3611
02:23:43,020 --> 02:23:44,320
Why is he targeting you?

3612
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:45,420
I don't know!

3613
02:23:46,900 --> 02:23:48,180
Yeah, we need some towers.

3614
02:23:48,440 --> 02:23:50,060
Yeah, I'm going to go start building some.

3615
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:02,480
I'm about to lose my car.

3616
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:05,000
Get another one!

3617
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:06,140
What's the cheat?

3618
02:24:06,700 --> 02:24:10,980
How do you turn this on?

3619
02:24:11,140 --> 02:24:11,660
This on?

3620
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,500
Yeah, I think so.

3621
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:14,900
Or this thing?

3622
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:15,840
I don't know.

3623
02:24:16,460 --> 02:24:17,020
Did you get it?

3624
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:17,360
Yeah.

3625
02:24:17,700 --> 02:24:18,480
But it exploded.

3626
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:19,920
What?

3627
02:24:20,140 --> 02:24:21,680
It literally exploded.

3628
02:24:23,740 --> 02:24:25,180
Oh, they killed my man!

3629
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:28,460
What's the noisy goat or whatever donkey?

3630
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:29,940
Noisy donkey, was it?

3631
02:24:30,300 --> 02:24:30,940
Noisy donkey?

3632
02:24:31,140 --> 02:24:32,040
That one was funny.

3633
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:35,380
There's just blood...

3634
02:24:36,580 --> 02:24:37,900
That's my stone!

3635
02:24:38,320 --> 02:24:39,580
That's my stone!

3636
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:42,240
I won't stand for this.

3637
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:43,920
I won't stand for this.

3638
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:47,640
You're stealing your stone?

3639
02:24:48,220 --> 02:24:50,920
Yeah, but there's stone right next to my house.

3640
02:24:51,620 --> 02:24:53,320
Next to my village and they're taking it.

3641
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:56,120
Well...

3642
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:57,920
Oh gosh.

3643
02:24:58,100 --> 02:24:59,860
Seems like...

3644
02:24:59,860 --> 02:25:02,860
I think I'm in war.

3645
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:04,120
I think...

3646
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:06,220
I'm chilling.

3647
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:07,500
I'm chilling.

3648
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:08,740
Everything is cool here.

3649
02:25:08,740 --> 02:25:12,340
You get all the resources and I'll take them out, you know?

3650
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:14,640
Oh my god.

3651
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:16,460
Ok, ok, sounds good.

3652
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:18,540
If he's focusing on you, I can be booming.

3653
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:21,220
Yeah, you boom, you boom, you boom, you boom.

3654
02:25:21,220 --> 02:25:22,160
Oh my god.

3655
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:26,920
I'm in castle age and I will try my best to get into imperial age as soon as possible.

3656
02:25:27,060 --> 02:25:28,000
You're in castle age?

3657
02:25:28,580 --> 02:25:29,300
Yeah, yeah.

3658
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:31,360
I'm building a castle right now.

3659
02:25:33,340 --> 02:25:35,280
Ok, I'll stay in the dark ages.

3660
02:25:36,400 --> 02:25:37,380
With my car.

3661
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:40,540
They're so aggressive.

3662
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:41,560
Ok, retreat, retreat.

3663
02:25:42,140 --> 02:25:42,800
Retreat, retreat.

3664
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:44,840
Aim for something better.

3665
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:45,380
Come on.

3666
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:46,420
I have some bored people.

3667
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:47,200
Come on, bored people.

3668
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:49,220
Do you have a market yet?

3669
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:51,700
No, should I make one now?

3670
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:52,100
Yes!

3671
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:52,780
What do you think?

3672
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:55,480
Build a market, ok.

3673
02:25:56,960 --> 02:25:58,220
Build a market.

3674
02:25:58,880 --> 02:25:59,960
After the castle.

3675
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:03,600
Oh my god, they killed all my guys farming wood.

3676
02:26:03,740 --> 02:26:04,100
Please.

3677
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:09,200
Again?

3678
02:26:11,220 --> 02:26:12,860
Stop killing my people.

3679
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:20,620
We need you.

3680
02:26:20,660 --> 02:26:22,200
We need you up front and center.

3681
02:26:22,880 --> 02:26:24,440
We need you up front and center.

3682
02:26:24,580 --> 02:26:25,040
Oh my gosh.

3683
02:26:25,100 --> 02:26:25,460
No, no.

3684
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:27,240
Just go back.

3685
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:30,320
Just go over here lady.

3686
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:31,420
I'm so scared.

3687
02:26:31,480 --> 02:26:33,380
I need you to farm wood.

3688
02:26:33,820 --> 02:26:34,180
Wood!

3689
02:26:34,740 --> 02:26:35,440
I need wood!

3690
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:38,360
Oh my god.

3691
02:26:41,020 --> 02:26:48,330
Wait, I forgot about the market.

3692
02:26:48,330 --> 02:26:50,050
Market ready, market ready.

3693
02:26:50,810 --> 02:26:51,590
Your market ready?

3694
02:26:52,490 --> 02:26:54,530
Yeah, I'm making a trade cart too right now.

3695
02:26:55,370 --> 02:26:57,270
Ok, I'm so glad I have this car.

3696
02:26:57,350 --> 02:26:59,170
I think I would have been dead three times over.

3697
02:27:00,810 --> 02:27:02,830
I would have been dead all the time.

3698
02:27:03,970 --> 02:27:05,730
Cars are amazing man.

3699
02:27:06,870 --> 02:27:09,010
Ok, finish building our watchtower.

3700
02:27:09,870 --> 02:27:11,950
Yeah, yeah.

3701
02:27:16,530 --> 02:27:18,950
I will need another one soon.

3702
02:27:19,810 --> 02:27:22,250
This thing isn't gonna do crap though.

3703
02:27:22,350 --> 02:27:24,370
This tower is not gonna do anything.

3704
02:27:26,250 --> 02:27:27,430
Cart is ready.

3705
02:27:28,270 --> 02:27:30,450
I see your place.

3706
02:27:30,690 --> 02:27:32,190
I will send cart now.

3707
02:27:32,390 --> 02:27:34,030
Go, go, go.

3708
02:27:35,210 --> 02:27:37,730
Now, now, now.

3709
02:27:37,730 --> 02:27:38,550
I just want to upgrade.

3710
02:27:38,810 --> 02:27:42,590
I need 800 gold.

3711
02:27:42,970 --> 02:27:44,130
Oh, I need a lot of gold.

3712
02:27:44,290 --> 02:27:46,150
I guess I could sell those.

3713
02:27:47,090 --> 02:27:48,390
But I don't know.

3714
02:27:48,890 --> 02:27:52,050
This doesn't do anything you guys, but it's ok.

3715
02:27:56,930 --> 02:27:59,030
What does that mean?

3716
02:27:59,250 --> 02:28:01,730
I'm gonna build a wall right here.

3717
02:28:02,970 --> 02:28:05,370
Peace agreement needs so can support trade.

3718
02:28:05,410 --> 02:28:06,670
Oh, relics have been captured!

3719
02:28:06,890 --> 02:28:09,090
He's building a wonder!

3720
02:28:09,630 --> 02:28:11,130
But there is one right here!

3721
02:28:11,510 --> 02:28:12,750
Why is he building a wonder?

3722
02:28:12,890 --> 02:28:13,430
He can...

3723
02:28:13,430 --> 02:28:14,170
No, nevermind.

3724
02:28:14,210 --> 02:28:14,650
It's not a wonder.

3725
02:28:14,810 --> 02:28:15,590
It's a relic timer.

3726
02:28:16,190 --> 02:28:17,690
No, he got all the relics!

3727
02:28:17,870 --> 02:28:18,870
That's what I said!

3728
02:28:20,490 --> 02:28:23,210
He can get a relic win.

3729
02:28:23,970 --> 02:28:26,350
Yeah, we need... Wait, how many years has it been?

3730
02:28:26,510 --> 02:28:28,730
Wait, we only have...

3731
02:28:28,730 --> 02:28:31,630
Wait, we only have 8 years left?

3732
02:28:31,930 --> 02:28:33,430
Oh no, it's counting down.

3733
02:28:33,970 --> 02:28:35,050
That's even worse.

3734
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:36,230
That's not much time.

3735
02:28:36,470 --> 02:28:39,730
We have to attack his monastery, otherwise...

3736
02:28:40,270 --> 02:28:43,370
I haven't even made it to the castle yet!

3737
02:28:45,090 --> 02:28:47,550
Should I go get some rams and just go...

3738
02:28:47,550 --> 02:28:50,550
Wait, can you make some cards and just destroy his fucking monastery?

3739
02:28:51,350 --> 02:28:53,970
How do you turn this on?

3740
02:28:55,370 --> 02:28:57,170
And just the monastery, ok?

3741
02:28:57,490 --> 02:28:58,630
Just the monastery.

3742
02:29:00,030 --> 02:29:00,550
Ok.

3743
02:29:01,250 --> 02:29:04,930
But then all he has to do is build a new monastery and put the relics in there.

3744
02:29:05,090 --> 02:29:06,810
What is he... He's taking my whip too.

3745
02:29:07,150 --> 02:29:10,690
Just the monastery, everybody.

3746
02:29:12,070 --> 02:29:12,790
Just the monastery.

3747
02:29:13,910 --> 02:29:17,990
We do need to take the relics away from him, so I'm gonna...

3748
02:29:17,990 --> 02:29:19,090
Just the monastery.

3749
02:29:19,690 --> 02:29:20,750
Just the monastery.

3750
02:29:21,410 --> 02:29:22,450
Just the monastery.

3751
02:29:22,830 --> 02:29:24,030
Hey, where are you guys going?

3752
02:29:24,490 --> 02:29:28,250
Where are you guys... You were guys gonna come for me and then you decided against it?

3753
02:29:28,270 --> 02:29:29,430
I'll make one for now.

3754
02:29:30,130 --> 02:29:30,690
Here they go.

3755
02:29:38,510 --> 02:29:40,190
Oh, my one car is stuck.

3756
02:29:47,950 --> 02:29:49,310
Control of relics was lost!

3757
02:29:51,710 --> 02:29:52,150
Go!

3758
02:29:52,970 --> 02:29:53,210
Go!

3759
02:29:53,530 --> 02:29:53,710
Go!

3760
02:29:54,310 --> 02:29:54,310
Go!

3761
02:29:55,590 --> 02:29:56,030
Retreat!

3762
02:29:56,350 --> 02:29:56,410
Retreat!

3763
02:29:56,410 --> 02:29:56,470
Retreat!

3764
02:29:56,690 --> 02:29:56,970
Retreat!

3765
02:29:58,950 --> 02:29:59,390
Retreat!

3766
02:29:59,690 --> 02:30:04,090
Oh, this one is stuck though, so I think he should just kind of chill here.

3767
02:30:04,610 --> 02:30:06,090
Do whatever he wants to do, you know?

3768
02:30:06,650 --> 02:30:07,770
He's parked, he's parked.

3769
02:30:07,790 --> 02:30:08,970
Yeah, he's parked, he's parked.

3770
02:30:09,210 --> 02:30:09,490
Ok.

3771
02:30:11,290 --> 02:30:11,730
See?

3772
02:30:11,730 --> 02:30:12,950
We're putting boundaries.

3773
02:30:13,130 --> 02:30:14,750
We're not using the cars to completely...

3774
02:30:14,750 --> 02:30:15,810
Yeah, exactly.

3775
02:30:15,970 --> 02:30:17,450
We just don't want a relic win.

3776
02:30:17,510 --> 02:30:19,950
We need more time to make ourselves stronger.

3777
02:30:20,410 --> 02:30:21,250
Yes, yes, yes.

3778
02:30:21,290 --> 02:30:21,790
Pretty much.

3779
02:30:22,630 --> 02:30:23,910
They will understand.

3780
02:30:24,010 --> 02:30:25,190
You guys understand that, right?

3781
02:30:25,270 --> 02:30:26,330
Look how shitty we are.

3782
02:30:26,450 --> 02:30:27,230
We need more time.

3783
02:30:27,510 --> 02:30:27,930
We need more...

3784
02:30:28,450 --> 02:30:29,730
You know, they need to go easy on us.

3785
02:30:31,470 --> 02:30:32,890
We can't handle this.

3786
02:30:33,630 --> 02:30:34,230
Will this be enough?

3787
02:30:35,210 --> 02:30:36,070
Will that be enough?

3788
02:30:37,290 --> 02:30:38,310
I don't need an entrance.

3789
02:30:40,190 --> 02:30:40,730
I don't wanna go.

3790
02:30:40,910 --> 02:30:41,450
I don't wanna...

3791
02:30:41,910 --> 02:30:42,270
Ok.

3792
02:30:47,090 --> 02:30:48,450
Alright, we're getting a wall.

3793
02:30:51,190 --> 02:30:52,190
We're getting a wall.

3794
02:30:52,450 --> 02:30:54,210
Let's make...

3795
02:30:54,210 --> 02:30:55,710
Some of these things.

3796
02:30:55,750 --> 02:30:56,050
Yeah!

3797
02:30:57,430 --> 02:30:58,590
I know, my cars are so messy.

3798
02:30:58,610 --> 02:31:00,910
Why am I making them when you can just send your cars?

3799
02:31:01,010 --> 02:31:01,930
I don't need to make ramps for them.

3800
02:31:01,930 --> 02:31:02,230
No!

3801
02:31:02,650 --> 02:31:03,650
No, no, no.

3802
02:31:05,230 --> 02:31:06,090
I lost all my cars.

3803
02:31:06,090 --> 02:31:09,070
If we can't do it legitimately, we'll try.

3804
02:31:09,350 --> 02:31:11,490
Yeah, we're going for it.

3805
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:20,000
Oh, there are some waters here and there, but I don't know if they're even worth it.

3806
02:31:21,100 --> 02:31:22,760
No, they're super tiny.

3807
02:31:23,580 --> 02:31:25,700
They'll be all outfished immediately.

3808
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:28,940
I'm actually... Do I wanna take that over?

3809
02:31:34,910 --> 02:31:36,110
Who is this?

3810
02:31:36,950 --> 02:31:38,170
These are just regular people.

3811
02:31:39,970 --> 02:31:40,450
Whomst?

3812
02:31:40,550 --> 02:31:40,890
Whomst?

3813
02:31:40,910 --> 02:31:42,550
We sent regular people to you?

3814
02:31:42,810 --> 02:31:44,830
Yeah, they sent... Wait, they're taking my wood!

3815
02:31:45,650 --> 02:31:46,790
It's just tourists.

3816
02:31:47,270 --> 02:31:48,330
Let them be.

3817
02:31:48,370 --> 02:31:49,010
No, no, no!

3818
02:31:49,010 --> 02:31:55,490
But now he also keeps on sending villagers to me now because he wants to build a farm over at my place.

3819
02:31:55,610 --> 02:31:56,170
It's so annoying.

3820
02:31:56,410 --> 02:31:57,430
They're taking my wood!

3821
02:31:59,930 --> 02:32:02,050
How did they... Where did he get that from?

3822
02:32:04,190 --> 02:32:05,630
He's distracting me.

3823
02:32:06,850 --> 02:32:07,910
Where did they get that?

3824
02:32:08,470 --> 02:32:10,410
Ok, I can go to the castle age.

3825
02:32:11,070 --> 02:32:12,250
Wait, wait!

3826
02:32:12,430 --> 02:32:16,870
He asked me... He wants to join my side if I send him 500 wood, food, gold and stone.

3827
02:32:16,870 --> 02:32:21,090
If thou dost this thing, I shall join thy side.

3828
02:32:21,270 --> 02:32:21,490
What?

3829
02:32:22,270 --> 02:32:22,490
Wait.

3830
02:32:22,950 --> 02:32:23,470
What?

3831
02:32:23,790 --> 02:32:24,210
How many?

3832
02:32:24,390 --> 02:32:24,790
How much?

3833
02:32:25,050 --> 02:32:26,030
No, that's silly.

3834
02:32:26,170 --> 02:32:26,870
That's silly.

3835
02:32:26,990 --> 02:32:28,430
We don't wanna win like that.

3836
02:32:28,550 --> 02:32:29,250
I'm going in.

3837
02:32:29,350 --> 02:32:30,250
I'm going in.

3838
02:32:30,450 --> 02:32:33,130
I cannot believe he has the audacity.

3839
02:32:33,730 --> 02:32:34,270
I'm going in.

3840
02:32:37,960 --> 02:32:39,700
That was too much for you.

3841
02:32:39,740 --> 02:32:40,540
Too much for me.

3842
02:32:40,940 --> 02:32:42,220
That was too much for me.

3843
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:46,000
How dare you try to get Takanashi Kira to...

3844
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:47,140
Betray a little bit, right?

3845
02:32:47,220 --> 02:32:48,820
You're just tickling him, right?

3846
02:32:48,860 --> 02:32:52,360
Yeah, I'm just gonna send a... you know...

3847
02:32:52,360 --> 02:32:52,820
I see.

3848
02:32:52,940 --> 02:32:55,680
It's like your cars are peeing at the townspeople.

3849
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:55,980
I know.

3850
02:32:57,440 --> 02:32:59,280
It's just like a little warning, you know?

3851
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:00,000
Like a little...

3852
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:02,760
Good warning.

3853
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:04,300
Keep on tickling him.

3854
02:33:04,340 --> 02:33:04,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3855
02:33:04,900 --> 02:33:07,020
While I am building my empire.

3856
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:09,440
Actually, I think I can...

3857
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:10,500
Guard duty.

3858
02:33:13,900 --> 02:33:16,780
Yeah, that was a warning for you, fellas.

3859
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:18,740
Big warning.

3860
02:33:25,490 --> 02:33:27,870
Can you show us Kiara's empire?

3861
02:33:29,450 --> 02:33:30,710
It's beautiful, isn't it?

3862
02:33:31,510 --> 02:33:32,970
I'm trying.

3863
02:33:33,510 --> 02:33:34,230
It's not...

3864
02:33:34,230 --> 02:33:35,090
You have so many people.

3865
02:33:35,530 --> 02:33:37,050
How are you doing it so well?

3866
02:33:37,810 --> 02:33:39,410
I could still make more...

3867
02:33:39,410 --> 02:33:41,650
Your scout is just kinda chilling there, by the way.

3868
02:33:42,770 --> 02:33:45,950
Oh, I already see the whole map.

3869
02:33:46,450 --> 02:33:47,470
Oh, that's true.

3870
02:33:47,650 --> 02:33:48,310
Yeah, me too.

3871
02:33:48,690 --> 02:33:49,370
Oh, that's green.

3872
02:33:51,670 --> 02:33:55,850
Your scout is also kinda chilling in the top left corner of the map.

3873
02:33:58,170 --> 02:33:59,270
Middle left.

3874
02:33:59,510 --> 02:34:00,430
You're castling!

3875
02:34:02,090 --> 02:34:04,910
How dare these people!

3876
02:34:08,410 --> 02:34:09,470
How dare!

3877
02:34:09,470 --> 02:34:11,870
You're building walls!

3878
02:34:12,130 --> 02:34:13,070
Yeah, I have to.

3879
02:34:13,490 --> 02:34:19,470
Some of us have people who keep ambushing our society.

3880
02:34:21,510 --> 02:34:22,570
Kill the innocent!

3881
02:34:22,950 --> 02:34:23,630
Kill the innocent!

3882
02:34:24,370 --> 02:34:26,830
They are complicit, so they are not innocent!

3883
02:34:28,810 --> 02:34:29,850
Kill the innocent!

3884
02:34:30,510 --> 02:34:31,090
See?

3885
02:34:34,130 --> 02:34:35,690
They've been stealing your stuff too.

3886
02:34:35,690 --> 02:34:36,570
See?

3887
02:34:37,950 --> 02:34:38,550
See?

3888
02:34:40,010 --> 02:34:41,370
It's like ants.

3889
02:34:41,510 --> 02:34:43,590
It feels like an ant invasion.

3890
02:34:43,630 --> 02:34:44,090
I know!

3891
02:34:44,630 --> 02:34:45,410
It's horrible!

3892
02:34:45,690 --> 02:34:47,450
Get the fuck out of here!

3893
02:34:48,670 --> 02:34:50,370
Can I convert buildings?

3894
02:34:51,230 --> 02:34:52,650
You can with the wooloos.

3895
02:34:55,070 --> 02:34:56,410
They allow cheats?

3896
02:34:56,610 --> 02:35:00,130
Ok, but you have to understand why we allow cheats.

3897
02:35:00,870 --> 02:35:04,650
You have to... Look at how this is going and you will understand.

3898
02:35:04,650 --> 02:35:07,870
Oh wait, I forgot to... No, I said I didn't need a gate.

3899
02:35:08,150 --> 02:35:09,650
I'll do a gate right here.

3900
02:35:13,590 --> 02:35:16,090
Yeah, do you want a support car?

3901
02:35:20,710 --> 02:35:21,770
Oh my god!

3902
02:35:21,830 --> 02:35:23,750
The audacity of these people!

3903
02:35:24,050 --> 02:35:25,150
They are just ridiculous!

3904
02:35:25,910 --> 02:35:29,650
They come into my territory and they build their little...

3905
02:35:30,510 --> 02:35:32,950
They build... Here, actually, I'll kill you.

3906
02:35:35,470 --> 02:35:36,550
He's so funny.

3907
02:35:36,750 --> 02:35:39,230
They build their little camps.

3908
02:35:39,750 --> 02:35:41,210
I can't... They're shameless.

3909
02:35:41,910 --> 02:35:42,690
Absolutely shameless.

3910
02:35:43,230 --> 02:35:44,010
What did I ask?

3911
02:35:44,790 --> 02:35:46,950
I'm being attacked by player MintPantone?

3912
02:35:47,490 --> 02:35:48,550
I'm being attacked?

3913
02:35:49,110 --> 02:35:50,690
No, I'm shooting the red.

3914
02:35:50,910 --> 02:35:51,650
I'm shooting the red.

3915
02:35:52,310 --> 02:35:52,970
Ok, ok.

3916
02:35:53,290 --> 02:35:53,550
See?

3917
02:35:53,790 --> 02:35:54,750
My car is still here.

3918
02:35:54,830 --> 02:35:55,570
He's a support car.

3919
02:35:56,470 --> 02:35:59,010
Actually, it won't even let me attack you, so...

3920
02:35:59,010 --> 02:36:00,390
Oh, that's weird.

3921
02:36:00,570 --> 02:36:00,810
Ok.

3922
02:36:02,650 --> 02:36:03,370
Weird information.

3923
02:36:03,430 --> 02:36:04,770
Ok, so you park your car here.

3924
02:36:04,850 --> 02:36:05,510
It's free parking.

3925
02:36:06,150 --> 02:36:07,710
Yeah, it's a support car for you.

3926
02:36:08,750 --> 02:36:09,450
Thank you.

3927
02:36:09,710 --> 02:36:10,250
You're welcome.

3928
02:36:10,690 --> 02:36:12,170
I'll call you when I'm in trouble.

3929
02:36:12,530 --> 02:36:13,790
No, he does it on his own.

3930
02:36:13,850 --> 02:36:14,490
He's so smart.

3931
02:36:15,970 --> 02:36:16,930
Oh, look at him.

3932
02:36:17,010 --> 02:36:18,830
Yeah, those stupid villagers.

3933
02:36:19,370 --> 02:36:20,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3934
02:36:20,410 --> 02:36:21,010
He'll take them down.

3935
02:36:21,090 --> 02:36:21,670
He'll take them down.

3936
02:36:22,690 --> 02:36:24,330
Oops, I keep doing right click instead.

3937
02:36:25,430 --> 02:36:26,150
Ok, alright.

3938
02:36:26,310 --> 02:36:28,090
Let's get some more villagers up in here.

3939
02:36:32,750 --> 02:36:33,310
Lala!

3940
02:36:33,670 --> 02:36:35,730
You can control attack for friendly fire.

3941
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:37,410
Oh, thank you.

3942
02:36:37,450 --> 02:36:39,890
Oh, I'm going to the last age.

3943
02:36:44,430 --> 02:36:49,270
Oh my god!

3944
02:36:52,860 --> 02:36:55,540
They set up a whole last thing to just attack me.

3945
02:36:56,620 --> 02:36:57,100
Ok, bye.

3946
02:37:01,340 --> 02:37:02,920
Did I lose some cars?

3947
02:37:02,980 --> 02:37:03,680
I think I did.

3948
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:04,340
Sad.

3949
02:37:12,060 --> 02:37:13,440
Line of defense.

3950
02:37:14,200 --> 02:37:16,060
Life is a highway.

3951
02:37:17,940 --> 02:37:20,800
I wanna ride it all night long.

3952
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:23,640
Yeah, they used to sing that in the feudal ages.

3953
02:37:23,940 --> 02:37:24,320
They did.

3954
02:37:25,250 --> 02:37:31,640
The more modern version that people know, that's actually a cover.

3955
02:37:32,780 --> 02:37:38,340
The old life is the old pathway.

3956
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:42,900
Thou like to traverse it.

3957
02:37:43,900 --> 02:37:46,660
You have such a way with words.

3958
02:37:47,380 --> 02:37:48,740
Such a word with word.

3959
02:37:49,800 --> 02:37:50,780
Ok.

3960
02:37:52,620 --> 02:37:54,880
Actually, nevermind.

3961
02:37:57,820 --> 02:38:00,400
I have stuff on fire, but we're ok.

3962
02:38:00,400 --> 02:38:01,720
Oh my god!

3963
02:38:02,020 --> 02:38:03,040
How did they get in?

3964
02:38:03,980 --> 02:38:05,120
How did they get in?

3965
02:38:05,220 --> 02:38:07,060
They traversed my wall!

3966
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:10,140
They used the gate.

3967
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:16,060
They definitely didn't go through the part that is entirely open.

3968
02:38:18,920 --> 02:38:20,240
Why is your tower burning?

3969
02:38:20,860 --> 02:38:21,460
Are you ok?

3970
02:38:21,800 --> 02:38:22,700
Don't worry about it.

3971
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:23,220
We're ok.

3972
02:38:24,480 --> 02:38:26,780
Yeah, don't worry about it.

3973
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:32,960
I'm not doing my best min-maxing performance.

3974
02:38:33,080 --> 02:38:34,020
I'm sorry guys.

3975
02:38:35,260 --> 02:38:36,220
Brain empty.

3976
02:38:36,600 --> 02:38:39,140
I'm doing a lot.

3977
02:38:41,140 --> 02:38:42,380
This guy is almost dead.

3978
02:38:45,820 --> 02:38:50,120
I am in imperial age, baby!

3979
02:38:51,900 --> 02:38:57,360
I'm gonna save you, my princess in...

3980
02:38:57,860 --> 02:38:58,940
What do you call it?

3981
02:38:59,700 --> 02:39:00,580
In distress.

3982
02:39:00,700 --> 02:39:01,720
My distressed princess.

3983
02:39:02,040 --> 02:39:03,700
Have they attacked you at all?

3984
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:05,380
No, no.

3985
02:39:05,560 --> 02:39:06,200
They're only sending...

3986
02:39:06,940 --> 02:39:08,140
Ah, he's doing the relic thing!

3987
02:39:08,660 --> 02:39:08,900
Again!

3988
02:39:09,720 --> 02:39:10,060
Get him!

3989
02:39:10,300 --> 02:39:10,500
Get him!

3990
02:39:11,060 --> 02:39:11,500
Get him!

3991
02:39:11,680 --> 02:39:12,280
Wait, what do you mean?

3992
02:39:12,440 --> 02:39:13,120
Where is the relic?

3993
02:39:14,120 --> 02:39:17,060
If you go to his... Yeah, he's doing it again.

3994
02:39:17,060 --> 02:39:20,860
The audacity.

3995
02:39:21,960 --> 02:39:25,700
I don't think they take me seriously as a civilization.

3996
02:39:25,960 --> 02:39:27,040
That makes me angry.

3997
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:31,220
There's nothing serious about the cars that you're using.

3998
02:39:31,360 --> 02:39:32,940
It seems really silly, but...

3999
02:39:32,940 --> 02:39:36,360
You know, what's interesting?

4000
02:39:36,660 --> 02:39:40,900
The Portuguese that I'm playing, they have a unique building that they can place.

4001
02:39:41,300 --> 02:39:42,240
It's pretty fancy.

4002
02:39:42,780 --> 02:39:50,020
It will automatically, once you build it, without you doing anything, it will automatically create more and more and more of your resources.

4003
02:39:50,420 --> 02:39:52,480
Like it just adds on to it without you doing anything.

4004
02:39:54,860 --> 02:39:57,000
Alright cars, roll out!

4005
02:40:01,240 --> 02:40:04,020
How helpful it really is, but...

4006
02:40:04,020 --> 02:40:05,600
I'm taking it down!

4007
02:40:05,720 --> 02:40:06,540
I'm taking it down!

4008
02:40:12,390 --> 02:40:14,050
Come on cars, you can make it.

4009
02:40:16,610 --> 02:40:18,270
There's a bit of a traffic jam.

4010
02:40:19,770 --> 02:40:21,470
Oh, it costs 20 population.

4011
02:40:23,270 --> 02:40:25,070
Am I getting attacked?

4012
02:40:25,690 --> 02:40:28,310
Is this already like minus 20?

4013
02:40:28,530 --> 02:40:30,170
So I had 120 before?

4014
02:40:32,010 --> 02:40:33,030
No problem.

4015
02:40:35,370 --> 02:40:37,890
Wait, how am I being attacked by myself?

4016
02:40:40,750 --> 02:40:41,390
What?

4017
02:40:41,390 --> 02:40:41,390
What?

4018
02:40:43,810 --> 02:40:44,470
Oh, my cars?

4019
02:40:44,850 --> 02:40:46,130
Maybe I should retreat?

4020
02:40:46,650 --> 02:40:47,530
Retreat cars, retreat!

4021
02:40:48,130 --> 02:40:48,770
My cars!

4022
02:40:49,190 --> 02:40:49,770
Autobots!

4023
02:40:50,170 --> 02:40:51,130
Autobots, roll out!

4024
02:40:53,490 --> 02:40:58,030
It took him a while to rebuild the monastery and put the relics in.

4025
02:40:58,590 --> 02:40:59,310
Yeah, it did.

4026
02:41:00,390 --> 02:41:01,570
I'm being attacked.

4027
02:41:04,550 --> 02:41:07,970
He made trebuchets to get rid of my tower.

4028
02:41:09,610 --> 02:41:12,030
Can you send your car to kill his trebuchet?

4029
02:41:12,670 --> 02:41:13,870
Wait, you still have a car.

4030
02:41:14,030 --> 02:41:15,010
Oh, I see it.

4031
02:41:15,070 --> 02:41:15,350
Can I?

4032
02:41:15,610 --> 02:41:16,490
I can't use it.

4033
02:41:16,590 --> 02:41:16,910
Oh, OK.

4034
02:41:16,970 --> 02:41:17,470
I got it.

4035
02:41:19,970 --> 02:41:22,970
Now he's trying to kill my camp.

4036
02:41:23,170 --> 02:41:23,450
Get him!

4037
02:41:23,610 --> 02:41:23,690
Get him!

4038
02:41:23,910 --> 02:41:24,490
Thank you!

4039
02:41:24,570 --> 02:41:24,990
Thank you!

4040
02:41:25,070 --> 02:41:25,650
I got him!

4041
02:41:25,650 --> 02:41:26,250
Thank you!

4042
02:41:28,590 --> 02:41:29,770
The car patrol.

4043
02:41:30,790 --> 02:41:31,870
He did it again!

4044
02:41:32,190 --> 02:41:33,270
How did he do it again?

4045
02:41:35,450 --> 02:41:36,350
Silly, silly.

4046
02:41:36,450 --> 02:41:38,150
Oh, there's a whole army there!

4047
02:41:39,130 --> 02:41:39,610
OK.

4048
02:41:39,750 --> 02:41:39,970
OK.

4049
02:41:40,130 --> 02:41:40,410
OK.

4050
02:41:40,690 --> 02:41:43,550
Can I send some genuine fighters?

4051
02:41:43,810 --> 02:41:46,270
I mean, you're probably gonna do it on your own, but...

4052
02:41:46,810 --> 02:41:50,430
I haven't made any actual men.

4053
02:41:52,750 --> 02:41:55,510
You're just relying on machines now.

4054
02:41:56,470 --> 02:41:57,650
I see how it is.

4055
02:41:59,270 --> 02:42:00,390
Well, well, why not?

4056
02:42:00,470 --> 02:42:00,830
Why not?

4057
02:42:00,830 --> 02:42:06,290
I mean, I work smarter, not harder.

4058
02:42:06,530 --> 02:42:08,990
Why do I have so many people on...

4059
02:42:09,550 --> 02:42:11,450
Why do I have eleven people?

4060
02:42:11,830 --> 02:42:12,650
Come on, everybody.

4061
02:42:12,910 --> 02:42:13,650
What are we doing?

4062
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:29,180
Oh my god, I have so many mats.

4063
02:42:29,400 --> 02:42:30,480
I have so much stuff.

4064
02:42:30,740 --> 02:42:32,120
I need to build my army!

4065
02:42:32,120 --> 02:42:33,580
Where am I being attacked?

4066
02:42:35,800 --> 02:42:37,280
Oh, I think over here.

4067
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:38,720
It's OK.

4068
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:41,800
What was I doing?

4069
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:43,520
Oh yeah, you take this.

4070
02:42:44,620 --> 02:42:45,800
Wood for years.

4071
02:42:45,900 --> 02:42:46,500
For real!

4072
02:42:46,880 --> 02:42:49,260
I was just building so much wood.

4073
02:42:53,260 --> 02:42:55,300
Organ guns are fun, right?

4074
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:58,040
Let's make some organ guns.

4075
02:42:59,120 --> 02:43:00,420
Let's build a university.

4076
02:43:00,520 --> 02:43:01,900
We're gonna start advancing.

4077
02:43:10,300 --> 02:43:15,260
Are you joining me soon in the Lost Imperial Age?

4078
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:17,380
I need more food.

4079
02:43:19,320 --> 02:43:21,440
I have a lot of food.

4080
02:43:21,660 --> 02:43:21,940
You do?

4081
02:43:22,100 --> 02:43:23,300
Oh wait, I can buy it.

4082
02:43:24,780 --> 02:43:25,820
I guess.

4083
02:43:26,100 --> 02:43:28,240
I could probably also give it to you for free, no?

4084
02:43:28,460 --> 02:43:29,600
Oh, do that instead.

4085
02:43:29,720 --> 02:43:30,800
That sounds a lot better.

4086
02:43:32,840 --> 02:43:33,360
No!

4087
02:43:33,360 --> 02:43:33,880
No!

4088
02:43:34,300 --> 02:43:35,580
You need to learn!

4089
02:43:35,880 --> 02:43:36,100
No!

4090
02:43:36,760 --> 02:43:37,380
I'm learning!

4091
02:43:37,780 --> 02:43:39,280
My cars are parked!

4092
02:43:39,400 --> 02:43:40,000
They're parked!

4093
02:43:42,860 --> 02:43:43,900
Sell wood?

4094
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:44,300
Oh yeah.

4095
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:49,000
Wait, what is this?

4096
02:43:49,780 --> 02:43:51,100
Reduces... Oh, reduces.

4097
02:43:53,300 --> 02:43:54,020
Go faster.

4098
02:43:55,140 --> 02:43:55,900
Now buy.

4099
02:43:56,260 --> 02:43:56,660
Buy.

4100
02:43:56,900 --> 02:43:57,180
Buy.

4101
02:43:57,520 --> 02:43:57,780
Buy.

4102
02:43:59,660 --> 02:44:01,300
OK, soon, soon, soon.

4103
02:44:01,360 --> 02:44:01,820
I'll be there.

4104
02:44:01,880 --> 02:44:02,280
I'll be there.

4105
02:44:04,500 --> 02:44:05,900
Oh my gosh, I have so much wood.

4106
02:44:06,620 --> 02:44:06,900
Sell.

4107
02:44:07,140 --> 02:44:07,320
Sell.

4108
02:44:07,640 --> 02:44:07,840
Sell.

4109
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:08,280
Sell.

4110
02:44:09,640 --> 02:44:11,820
Did I accidentally buy wood instead of sell it?

4111
02:44:13,220 --> 02:44:13,740
No!

4112
02:44:15,460 --> 02:44:18,320
You silly, silly girl.

4113
02:44:18,620 --> 02:44:20,680
I'm going into the Imperial Age!

4114
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:26,640
I think we need to... OK, I'm gonna send my cars in.

4115
02:44:27,740 --> 02:44:28,680
For the relic.

4116
02:44:29,060 --> 02:44:29,620
For the relic.

4117
02:44:30,620 --> 02:44:33,000
Oops, he did it again.

4118
02:44:34,340 --> 02:44:34,740
Cars!

4119
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:36,400
That one has been around for a while.

4120
02:44:36,460 --> 02:44:37,540
It's already 144.

4121
02:44:38,800 --> 02:44:39,180
I know.

4122
02:44:39,540 --> 02:44:41,800
We need to take care of it.

4123
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:47,180
Hey, hey, hey!

4124
02:44:47,380 --> 02:44:47,960
What are you guys... Focus!

4125
02:44:48,100 --> 02:44:48,500
Focus!

4126
02:44:48,680 --> 02:44:48,860
Focus!

4127
02:44:49,560 --> 02:44:49,960
Focus!

4128
02:44:50,180 --> 02:44:50,180
Focus!

4129
02:44:50,180 --> 02:44:50,240
Focus!

4130
02:44:52,780 --> 02:44:53,000
Focus!

4131
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:53,360
Focus!

4132
02:45:05,880 --> 02:45:08,180
They're exploding one by one.

4133
02:45:09,640 --> 02:45:10,480
Attack this!

4134
02:45:12,080 --> 02:45:13,580
Click the meat.

4135
02:45:18,900 --> 02:45:20,100
He's trying.

4136
02:45:20,100 --> 02:45:20,200
Again.

4137
02:45:22,360 --> 02:45:23,900
OK, there we go.

4138
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:27,140
Who's healing?

4139
02:45:27,480 --> 02:45:28,020
No, no, no.

4140
02:45:28,680 --> 02:45:29,280
Kill this guy.

4141
02:45:34,140 --> 02:45:35,980
All my cars are about to be exploded.

4142
02:45:39,720 --> 02:45:43,400
Control, the relic is lost, but they have a building still.

4143
02:45:44,340 --> 02:45:46,180
Sorry guys, I need more cars.

4144
02:45:48,820 --> 02:45:50,280
OK, four more cars.

4145
02:45:51,860 --> 02:45:53,580
Alright, we're going in.

4146
02:45:59,820 --> 02:46:02,920
Guys, we're playing the game fairly, except in this part, OK?

4147
02:46:03,440 --> 02:46:04,640
Yeah, I noticed that.

4148
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:06,320
And a few other parts.

4149
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:07,220
Just small parts.

4150
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:08,920
Just small, small parts.

4151
02:46:09,260 --> 02:46:11,600
OK, it crumbled, it crumbled, it crumbled.

4152
02:46:12,700 --> 02:46:15,240
Otherwise this whole stream would already be over a while ago.

4153
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:16,160
Alright, retreat, retreat.

4154
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:21,640
I can't leave Kiara to, you know, be all by herself.

4155
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:22,940
You guys wouldn't want that.

4156
02:46:23,740 --> 02:46:25,380
That would be so sad.

4157
02:46:26,060 --> 02:46:28,320
I would be so stressed out and then I would die too.

4158
02:46:28,520 --> 02:46:30,060
Welcome to Imperial Age.

4159
02:46:30,120 --> 02:46:31,580
You finally caught up with the times.

4160
02:46:31,620 --> 02:46:32,280
I'm here.

4161
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:34,340
I caught up.

4162
02:46:34,900 --> 02:46:35,860
Fortified blood.

4163
02:46:38,100 --> 02:46:39,060
Oh, masonry.

4164
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:42,860
Girl, I'm making the best army, the biggest army you've ever seen.

4165
02:46:42,860 --> 02:46:46,160
And we're gonna go in there fair and square with maybe...

4166
02:46:46,160 --> 02:46:48,740
Oh, hey, hey, hey, cars, cars, cars.

4167
02:46:48,860 --> 02:46:50,720
Cars, roll out, roll out.

4168
02:46:50,820 --> 02:46:52,620
Tenderly, tenderly.

4169
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:53,520
Oh, he's stuck.

4170
02:46:53,940 --> 02:46:58,600
How did you... Those overpowered cars, how do you even manage to lose them?

4171
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:04,640
Do you have like a free entrance pass or how are they letting you in there anyway?

4172
02:47:05,220 --> 02:47:06,140
I don't know.

4173
02:47:06,800 --> 02:47:08,620
They're just kinda letting it happen.

4174
02:47:09,680 --> 02:47:10,800
Where's my other cars at?

4175
02:47:10,880 --> 02:47:11,440
Did they all die?

4176
02:47:12,860 --> 02:47:14,460
They know that you're so stubborn.

4177
02:47:14,820 --> 02:47:17,980
If they won't let you in, you'll destroy everything that's in front of you.

4178
02:47:18,180 --> 02:47:20,480
I think all my cars died, except one.

4179
02:47:20,620 --> 02:47:22,100
Where did they go?

4180
02:47:26,100 --> 02:47:27,800
It's hard on this map, right?

4181
02:47:27,880 --> 02:47:30,400
Because the cars are green and it's so green.

4182
02:47:32,520 --> 02:47:37,160
Can you... You know that scout that you have in the very corner left side of the map?

4183
02:47:38,020 --> 02:47:38,460
Yeah.

4184
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:40,620
Tell him to kill those villagers.

4185
02:47:40,620 --> 02:47:42,520
I wanna see blood.

4186
02:47:42,920 --> 02:47:43,140
Blood!

4187
02:47:45,260 --> 02:47:48,860
Gosh, they move out far.

4188
02:47:50,340 --> 02:47:52,700
There's a lot more villagers than I thought there would be.

4189
02:47:52,960 --> 02:47:54,340
He can handle it.

4190
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:55,780
They're turning on him.

4191
02:48:02,670 --> 02:48:04,550
It was worth a try.

4192
02:48:04,970 --> 02:48:06,830
I would've known that there's so many more.

4193
02:48:07,190 --> 02:48:07,810
They're still trying.

4194
02:48:07,810 --> 02:48:10,170
Kiara, they just eat everything.

4195
02:48:10,310 --> 02:48:12,530
I make the food and they don't even help.

4196
02:48:12,630 --> 02:48:14,530
They just take everything.

4197
02:48:16,750 --> 02:48:17,950
They're so evil.

4198
02:48:18,730 --> 02:48:19,730
They're so evil.

4199
02:48:21,130 --> 02:48:21,690
It's okay.

4200
02:48:22,490 --> 02:48:23,390
I'm building.

4201
02:48:23,750 --> 02:48:24,830
I'm making.

4202
02:48:27,170 --> 02:48:28,890
Should I make them work faster?

4203
02:48:29,090 --> 02:48:30,190
Because that will...

4204
02:48:30,190 --> 02:48:30,990
Research...

4205
02:48:30,990 --> 02:48:32,790
Does that mean they create them faster?

4206
02:48:33,290 --> 02:48:33,850
Spies?

4207
02:48:35,350 --> 02:48:36,150
I think so, right?

4208
02:48:37,810 --> 02:48:39,110
You wanted blood, you got blood.

4209
02:48:39,150 --> 02:48:39,850
That's true.

4210
02:48:40,190 --> 02:48:41,450
We definitely got blood.

4211
02:48:42,810 --> 02:48:44,710
Blood, blood, more blood.

4212
02:48:46,670 --> 02:48:48,810
We are coming for blood too, soon.

4213
02:48:51,750 --> 02:48:52,670
Kill this guy?

4214
02:48:53,130 --> 02:48:54,130
Kill these guys?

4215
02:48:56,890 --> 02:48:59,450
My wall is working at least, everybody.

4216
02:49:01,570 --> 02:49:03,110
We're almost out of trees.

4217
02:49:04,710 --> 02:49:06,150
Time to move camp.

4218
02:49:06,150 --> 02:49:07,190
Another castle, true.

4219
02:49:07,370 --> 02:49:08,850
Oh my god, I have so many...

4220
02:49:08,850 --> 02:49:10,910
Wait, why do I have so many bored people?

4221
02:49:11,610 --> 02:49:13,010
You go over here, build a lumber.

4222
02:49:14,270 --> 02:49:15,250
Build a lumber camp.

4223
02:49:17,150 --> 02:49:18,090
So many bored people.

4224
02:49:18,370 --> 02:49:19,870
Guys, there's a lot to handle here.

4225
02:49:21,530 --> 02:49:21,930
Right?

4226
02:49:22,690 --> 02:49:27,470
That's why... See, I really like the idea of this game.

4227
02:49:28,330 --> 02:49:31,690
But then there's so many points that stress me out and I wish I was better at it.

4228
02:49:31,870 --> 02:49:35,050
That's why I had myself be trained.

4229
02:49:35,050 --> 02:49:36,830
It comes with practice.

4230
02:49:36,970 --> 02:49:41,010
I think this is good practice though, because I've only played on the easy ones.

4231
02:49:41,210 --> 02:49:46,990
And so now I can actually see how an AI at its strongest would work, you know what I mean?

4232
02:49:47,770 --> 02:49:48,650
It's kind of scary.

4233
02:49:48,830 --> 02:49:49,510
It's really scary.

4234
02:49:49,910 --> 02:49:52,290
It's not its strongest yet though.

4235
02:49:52,570 --> 02:49:52,850
What?

4236
02:49:53,130 --> 02:49:53,710
They're stronger?

4237
02:49:54,590 --> 02:49:56,690
Yeah, extreme I think.

4238
02:49:58,050 --> 02:50:01,530
And then you could still make it more difficult by changing other settings too.

4239
02:50:03,230 --> 02:50:05,530
I'm pretty sure...

4240
02:50:07,470 --> 02:50:08,910
Oh no, I'm out of stone!

4241
02:50:13,900 --> 02:50:15,700
Time to build camp here.

4242
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:17,620
Oh, I hear cars.

4243
02:50:18,600 --> 02:50:21,080
Oh, I hear one car is bullying one villager.

4244
02:50:21,160 --> 02:50:21,900
Nevermind, he's done.

4245
02:50:22,180 --> 02:50:24,380
Yeah, they're trying to build stuff and I'm not letting them.

4246
02:50:26,420 --> 02:50:28,340
Gotta stop them from booming somehow.

4247
02:50:28,560 --> 02:50:29,400
But wait a second!

4248
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:32,200
His resources are so much worse than ours.

4249
02:50:34,920 --> 02:50:35,540
Actually...

4250
02:50:35,540 --> 02:50:37,320
We have a chance now I would say.

4251
02:50:37,460 --> 02:50:38,360
Maybe, maybe.

4252
02:50:38,780 --> 02:50:40,140
Chat, do we have a chance?

4253
02:50:42,020 --> 02:50:43,940
Surely we have a chance.

4254
02:50:46,040 --> 02:50:48,320
Alright, I have these guys.

4255
02:50:48,480 --> 02:50:49,580
You can go.

4256
02:50:50,820 --> 02:50:55,340
We'll need more food probably.

4257
02:51:00,360 --> 02:51:00,840
Alright.

4258
02:51:01,480 --> 02:51:03,060
The cars have made a dent.

4259
02:51:03,160 --> 02:51:05,860
The cars have... Look at them, they're on security duty.

4260
02:51:06,780 --> 02:51:07,880
What the hell is that?

4261
02:51:08,160 --> 02:51:08,880
What is this?

4262
02:51:09,300 --> 02:51:10,200
Oh, siege workshop.

4263
02:51:10,340 --> 02:51:11,880
Gosh, they are relentless.

4264
02:51:12,040 --> 02:51:12,880
They just never stop.

4265
02:51:15,220 --> 02:51:17,040
It's rough out here, man.

4266
02:51:18,120 --> 02:51:21,560
I'm hurting my own villagers because I'm trying to hurt their villagers.

4267
02:51:22,800 --> 02:51:23,280
No!

4268
02:51:23,440 --> 02:51:26,160
I should just make them...

4269
02:51:29,050 --> 02:51:30,450
Oh my gosh.

4270
02:51:32,610 --> 02:51:33,990
They are so annoying.

4271
02:51:34,090 --> 02:51:35,270
It's time to kill them soon.

4272
02:51:36,630 --> 02:51:37,610
Yeah, I agree.

4273
02:51:39,390 --> 02:51:40,770
I'm gonna make more cars.

4274
02:51:43,830 --> 02:51:44,570
No, no.

4275
02:51:44,750 --> 02:51:45,470
I'm doing it fair.

4276
02:51:45,670 --> 02:51:46,250
I'm fair.

4277
02:51:46,890 --> 02:51:51,310
Don't make too many because otherwise the win will be just because of your cars.

4278
02:51:51,830 --> 02:51:52,430
Yeah, I know.

4279
02:51:54,590 --> 02:51:56,510
Wouldn't that be beautiful though, Kiara?

4280
02:51:57,810 --> 02:52:00,850
What if we had just one car on our team?

4281
02:52:02,690 --> 02:52:03,650
One is fine.

4282
02:52:03,710 --> 02:52:04,370
Or two maybe.

4283
02:52:10,750 --> 02:52:11,610
All gold income.

4284
02:52:12,850 --> 02:52:13,710
What's this one?

4285
02:52:13,790 --> 02:52:15,430
Upgrade your gulams.

4286
02:52:16,050 --> 02:52:16,990
Elite gulams.

4287
02:52:17,590 --> 02:52:18,270
I like elite.

4288
02:52:20,830 --> 02:52:22,910
Is that a new cheat code that you're learning?

4289
02:52:23,170 --> 02:52:25,330
No, I researched it in the castle.

4290
02:52:27,130 --> 02:52:29,050
The castle is telling you cheat codes now?

4291
02:52:29,270 --> 02:52:29,270
No!

4292
02:52:29,870 --> 02:52:30,890
What is this?

4293
02:52:31,030 --> 02:52:32,250
Economic building.

4294
02:52:34,410 --> 02:52:36,010
What is this?

4295
02:52:37,650 --> 02:52:42,010
Actually, I think this is my first time getting to the imperial age in any game that I've ever played.

4296
02:52:45,990 --> 02:52:46,930
How is it?

4297
02:52:46,970 --> 02:52:47,590
Do you like it?

4298
02:52:48,410 --> 02:52:50,770
It's close to how we live now, isn't it?

4299
02:52:50,930 --> 02:52:51,610
I'm stressed.

4300
02:52:52,610 --> 02:52:53,650
Yeah, it's pretty close.

4301
02:52:55,750 --> 02:52:57,470
Fucking economy, man.

4302
02:52:57,550 --> 02:52:58,450
It's so bad.

4303
02:52:59,050 --> 02:53:00,010
So stressful.

4304
02:53:00,550 --> 02:53:01,690
We live in a society.

4305
02:53:02,150 --> 02:53:04,210
How do I get more food, Kiara?

4306
02:53:06,210 --> 02:53:07,510
You want more food?

4307
02:53:08,110 --> 02:53:09,190
I have so much.

4308
02:53:09,670 --> 02:53:11,650
I wish I realized how to give it to you.

4309
02:53:11,650 --> 02:53:14,330
They are relentless about this gold.

4310
02:53:14,550 --> 02:53:15,630
I won't let you have it.

4311
02:53:16,750 --> 02:53:18,850
I can lower my tribute fee, I think.

4312
02:53:20,150 --> 02:53:21,790
But you have cars.

4313
02:53:21,850 --> 02:53:22,650
Why do you need food?

4314
02:53:22,650 --> 02:53:23,530
What?

4315
02:53:23,710 --> 02:53:24,910
I need to make people.

4316
02:53:25,870 --> 02:53:26,690
Okay, okay.

4317
02:53:27,070 --> 02:53:28,830
Chat, teach me...

4318
02:53:28,830 --> 02:53:29,410
Pause.

4319
02:53:29,870 --> 02:53:32,190
Teach me, chat... Oh, I can't press it.

4320
02:53:32,530 --> 02:53:33,810
I guess you don't see this window.

4321
02:53:34,090 --> 02:53:35,650
Chat, teach me how to...

4322
02:53:37,630 --> 02:53:40,190
First, let's wait for the tribute fee to lower.

4323
02:53:42,150 --> 02:53:44,430
This guy... So many idols.

4324
02:53:44,850 --> 02:53:45,190
You know what?

4325
02:53:45,250 --> 02:53:47,570
You can make our own mining camp.

4326
02:53:48,610 --> 02:53:51,150
I've been fighting for my life out here.

4327
02:53:51,190 --> 02:53:52,570
I think I deserve...

4328
02:53:54,390 --> 02:53:57,470
I've been fighting for my life out here all day long.

4329
02:53:57,890 --> 02:54:00,250
Against these damn guys.

4330
02:54:00,390 --> 02:54:02,330
They're trying to set up mining camps.

4331
02:54:02,970 --> 02:54:05,430
They attack me every two seconds.

4332
02:54:05,990 --> 02:54:06,750
I can't stand them.

4333
02:54:06,750 --> 02:54:12,530
Honestly, without you, I wouldn't be able to have such a chill time building my economy.

4334
02:54:12,830 --> 02:54:13,790
So, I appreciate that.

4335
02:54:13,910 --> 02:54:14,790
Yeah, you're welcome.

4336
02:54:14,950 --> 02:54:15,790
Wait, what is this guy doing?

4337
02:54:18,150 --> 02:54:22,390
I have 51 of the organ, guys.

4338
02:54:22,650 --> 02:54:25,330
So, soon... A couple more.

4339
02:54:25,830 --> 02:54:26,490
A couple more.

4340
02:54:26,710 --> 02:54:27,530
Okay, I built that.

4341
02:54:27,650 --> 02:54:28,290
I built the building.

4342
02:54:28,930 --> 02:54:31,170
Okay, let's do a wonder.

4343
02:54:31,510 --> 02:54:32,650
I can build a wonder?

4344
02:54:33,950 --> 02:54:35,750
Well, a wonder wind is also kind of lame.

4345
02:54:35,790 --> 02:54:37,810
And before you build a wonder, I'm gonna kill that guy.

4346
02:54:37,910 --> 02:54:38,570
So, don't worry.

4347
02:54:38,830 --> 02:54:41,230
Wait, but what do you mean a wonder wind is kind of lame?

4348
02:54:41,230 --> 02:54:43,770
I'm sending you 1,000 food.

4349
02:54:45,050 --> 02:54:46,490
Oh, thank you.

4350
02:54:53,070 --> 02:54:53,670
Thank you.

4351
02:54:53,670 --> 02:54:55,510
But what if I did a wonder wind?

4352
02:54:55,810 --> 02:54:58,210
You're my wonder wind.

4353
02:55:01,110 --> 02:55:02,470
But a wonder wind...

4354
02:55:02,470 --> 02:55:08,570
While you are constantly sending cars to, you know...

4355
02:55:08,570 --> 02:55:11,250
Save yourself...

4356
02:55:11,250 --> 02:55:12,690
It's not right.

4357
02:55:12,790 --> 02:55:13,170
It's not right.

4358
02:55:13,210 --> 02:55:15,530
We have to attack him with our own hands and punch him in the face.

4359
02:55:15,530 --> 02:55:15,910
Okay.

4360
02:55:17,190 --> 02:55:18,970
We want him to die.

4361
02:55:20,050 --> 02:55:20,790
No mercy.

4362
02:55:21,590 --> 02:55:25,610
Anytime they get close, my car really gives them a run for their money.

4363
02:55:29,730 --> 02:55:31,190
I'm running out of gold now.

4364
02:55:31,370 --> 02:55:31,810
Oh no.

4365
02:55:32,110 --> 02:55:32,790
You need gold?

4366
02:55:33,650 --> 02:55:34,370
No, no, no.

4367
02:55:34,530 --> 02:55:36,490
I'll sell on my market.

4368
02:55:39,310 --> 02:55:44,130
Can't they see that I literally have a mill right here?

4369
02:55:44,130 --> 02:55:46,270
And yet...

4370
02:55:46,270 --> 02:55:50,670
They just don't... I think they just don't stop populating.

4371
02:55:51,450 --> 02:55:53,450
Their people are crazy.

4372
02:55:54,110 --> 02:55:55,690
But, you know, it's a strategy.

4373
02:55:55,950 --> 02:55:57,430
They continue to annoy you.

4374
02:55:57,610 --> 02:55:59,610
They really do continue to annoy me.

4375
02:55:59,790 --> 02:56:00,730
Oh my god.

4376
02:56:00,790 --> 02:56:02,910
It takes their attention from other things.

4377
02:56:03,470 --> 02:56:07,210
Like, real people would probably do that too.

4378
02:56:07,310 --> 02:56:08,070
Real players.

4379
02:56:08,070 --> 02:56:14,310
Just have people of, like, just non-stop population growth?

4380
02:56:15,570 --> 02:56:16,170
Yes.

4381
02:56:16,630 --> 02:56:17,170
Wow.

4382
02:56:19,190 --> 02:56:20,850
What can I take of theirs?

4383
02:56:21,010 --> 02:56:21,590
It's important.

4384
02:56:21,890 --> 02:56:23,250
Never stop your growth.

4385
02:56:23,450 --> 02:56:23,650
Never.

4386
02:56:23,950 --> 02:56:24,870
Never ever.

4387
02:56:25,590 --> 02:56:26,210
Don't stop.

4388
02:56:26,310 --> 02:56:26,770
Don't stop.

4389
02:56:26,990 --> 02:56:29,670
Just grow yourself some more babies.

4390
02:56:30,110 --> 02:56:30,310
Oh.

4391
02:56:31,130 --> 02:56:32,630
I guess I'll upgrade that.

4392
02:56:32,950 --> 02:56:33,990
Let's see, what can we upgrade?

4393
02:56:34,570 --> 02:56:35,770
We got a siege.

4394
02:56:35,770 --> 02:56:37,510
I can do armored elephants!

4395
02:56:41,190 --> 02:56:41,830
Elephants?

4396
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:56,620
I'm gonna make more farms.

4397
02:56:57,560 --> 02:56:59,060
I need more farms.

4398
02:57:02,980 --> 02:57:05,480
You guys think that you're gonna come and ambush me, huh?

4399
02:57:05,480 --> 02:57:06,840
You guys think.

4400
02:57:07,080 --> 02:57:09,080
What are you trying to do coming up here, huh?

4401
02:57:11,060 --> 02:57:13,360
I'm so, so ready.

4402
02:57:13,500 --> 02:57:14,760
I have 60.

4403
02:57:15,340 --> 02:57:16,620
Do you think that's enough chat?

4404
02:57:16,960 --> 02:57:17,440
60?

4405
02:57:19,300 --> 02:57:21,540
60 of one single unit.

4406
02:57:21,840 --> 02:57:22,660
I think you need 80.

4407
02:57:22,840 --> 02:57:23,640
I think you need 80.

4408
02:57:25,060 --> 02:57:26,260
I'm not gonna lie.

4409
02:57:26,740 --> 02:57:27,680
Wait, where am I getting attacked?

4410
02:57:29,260 --> 02:57:31,300
The pikeman wants to know your elephant's location.

4411
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:33,360
They don't have elephants, right?

4412
02:57:33,420 --> 02:57:34,600
Only mint.

4413
02:57:34,600 --> 02:57:37,040
I made quite a few pikeman too.

4414
02:57:37,280 --> 02:57:37,920
They don't have.

4415
02:57:39,020 --> 02:57:39,960
60 is plenty.

4416
02:57:40,220 --> 02:57:43,580
Okay, we're rolling out, girl.

4417
02:57:43,960 --> 02:57:45,700
Mint, let's freaking go.

4418
02:57:47,400 --> 02:57:49,980
What do I contribute to this?

4419
02:57:52,980 --> 02:57:56,220
No need to send the cars just yet.

4420
02:57:56,380 --> 02:57:57,400
We might be fine.

4421
02:57:58,300 --> 02:58:00,340
Okay, I'll watch you, right?

4422
02:58:03,260 --> 02:58:05,520
Oh, but you have nothing but cars?

4423
02:58:08,340 --> 02:58:09,620
Wow, look at you go.

4424
02:58:10,080 --> 02:58:10,940
Oh my god.

4425
02:58:12,300 --> 02:58:12,920
What are these?

4426
02:58:13,500 --> 02:58:14,700
Organ guns?

4427
02:58:15,260 --> 02:58:15,680
Oh my god.

4428
02:58:16,600 --> 02:58:17,940
I guess 60 is max.

4429
02:58:18,280 --> 02:58:20,480
Then I might have more than 60 actually.

4430
02:58:21,520 --> 02:58:23,340
60 is max for like...

4431
02:58:26,780 --> 02:58:28,620
Okay, get over here guys.

4432
02:58:35,510 --> 02:58:36,930
Oh, I'm getting...

4433
02:58:38,030 --> 02:58:39,530
This is difficult.

4434
02:58:40,230 --> 02:58:42,190
Is there just a regular person?

4435
02:58:42,990 --> 02:58:46,430
Are they also infiltrating over here too?

4436
02:58:46,690 --> 02:58:48,750
Where have they not touched my land?

4437
02:58:49,370 --> 02:58:52,670
Don't worry, we don't need to worry about that anymore.

4438
02:58:53,750 --> 02:58:54,330
What is this?

4439
02:58:54,570 --> 02:58:55,550
Siege workshop.

4440
02:58:56,730 --> 02:58:57,530
Oh, there's deer here.

4441
02:58:57,650 --> 02:58:58,630
Oh my god!

4442
02:58:58,630 --> 02:59:00,090
Oh my god!

4443
02:59:00,610 --> 02:59:01,750
Oh my god!

4444
02:59:01,850 --> 02:59:04,110
They've been inside my walls this entire time.

4445
02:59:05,710 --> 02:59:07,090
You could have had them for food.

4446
02:59:07,290 --> 02:59:08,450
They would have given good food.

4447
02:59:08,650 --> 02:59:09,570
They would have, yeah.

4448
02:59:11,770 --> 02:59:13,810
Alright, battle has begun!

4449
02:59:14,310 --> 02:59:14,870
Oh it has?

4450
02:59:15,070 --> 02:59:15,610
Where are you?

4451
02:59:15,970 --> 02:59:16,610
Oh my god!

4452
02:59:16,870 --> 02:59:19,110
Oh my god, I'm coming with the cars.

4453
02:59:19,770 --> 02:59:20,170
Yeah!

4454
02:59:21,050 --> 02:59:23,710
I only have two of them, so you know...

4455
02:59:23,710 --> 02:59:25,630
You'll have to like...

4456
02:59:26,630 --> 02:59:28,210
It might be a little scary.

4457
02:59:30,950 --> 02:59:31,450
Destruction!

4458
02:59:32,330 --> 02:59:33,670
I'm not even using my monks.

4459
02:59:33,770 --> 02:59:34,510
I'm coming here!

4460
02:59:35,530 --> 02:59:36,710
He built the relics.

4461
02:59:36,810 --> 02:59:37,970
We can ignore the relics now.

4462
02:59:39,090 --> 02:59:40,730
Wait, they built relics?

4463
02:59:40,970 --> 02:59:41,170
Where?

4464
02:59:42,270 --> 02:59:43,970
Oh I see it, I see it down there.

4465
02:59:45,030 --> 02:59:46,130
Oh my god.

4466
02:59:48,150 --> 02:59:49,110
Take it down!

4467
02:59:51,310 --> 02:59:52,250
What is this?

4468
02:59:53,230 --> 02:59:54,110
Archery range!

4469
02:59:54,210 --> 02:59:54,950
Take it down!

4470
02:59:55,730 --> 02:59:56,410
All of it!

4471
02:59:56,430 --> 02:59:57,450
All of it must go!

4472
02:59:58,050 --> 02:59:59,190
I'm doing my part.

4473
03:00:01,230 --> 03:00:02,570
We're gonna be fine.

4474
03:00:05,230 --> 03:00:06,870
Oh they are sending one monk.

4475
03:00:07,010 --> 03:00:08,910
What are you gonna do with this one monk?

4476
03:00:08,990 --> 03:00:10,650
What do you think this one monk can do?

4477
03:00:10,750 --> 03:00:11,050
Nothing!

4478
03:00:12,130 --> 03:00:12,990
Or everything.

4479
03:00:13,370 --> 03:00:13,370
No!

4480
03:00:13,370 --> 03:00:14,850
You will not convert anything!

4481
03:00:15,150 --> 03:00:15,550
Where is he?

4482
03:00:23,030 --> 03:00:24,250
Take them down!

4483
03:00:24,850 --> 03:00:29,470
Take them down!

4484
03:00:30,290 --> 03:00:30,890
Take them down!

4485
03:00:31,010 --> 03:00:32,430
Wow, their place is packed.

4486
03:00:33,230 --> 03:00:34,930
Careful now, careful now.

4487
03:00:35,190 --> 03:00:36,330
Take some distance.

4488
03:00:37,130 --> 03:00:37,630
Yeah, distance.

4489
03:00:39,610 --> 03:00:42,430
They are all shooting like bombs and stuff.

4490
03:00:42,970 --> 03:00:44,230
So I wanna shoot my own units.

4491
03:00:45,990 --> 03:00:46,710
No friendly fire...

4492
03:00:48,130 --> 03:00:48,870
We're in!

4493
03:00:48,870 --> 03:00:52,130
He's so in, but he's blocking everything with buildings too.

4494
03:00:52,310 --> 03:00:54,670
I know, their place is dense.

4495
03:00:55,390 --> 03:00:56,690
Is this the strat you guys?

4496
03:00:59,670 --> 03:01:00,910
No, this doesn't feel unfair.

4497
03:01:01,910 --> 03:01:02,370
Look Kiara...

4498
03:01:03,690 --> 03:01:06,350
Kiara worked really hard to get all that.

4499
03:01:06,850 --> 03:01:09,350
And I'm also working hard to stay alive.

4500
03:01:09,970 --> 03:01:12,190
Are they telling you to get more cars or what?

4501
03:01:12,310 --> 03:01:14,450
No, they're saying this feels unfair.

4502
03:01:14,450 --> 03:01:16,310
Oh, no!

4503
03:01:17,530 --> 03:01:20,630
You guys, you saw how I would've been dead meat.

4504
03:01:20,650 --> 03:01:27,450
I would've been dead meat you guys, if not...

4505
03:01:28,250 --> 03:01:28,950
Ok, I'm back.

4506
03:01:30,130 --> 03:01:30,910
Welcome back.

4507
03:01:31,930 --> 03:01:32,770
What is here?

4508
03:01:32,890 --> 03:01:33,970
Oh, there's another car.

4509
03:01:34,670 --> 03:01:36,010
Oh, I think my cars died.

4510
03:01:37,890 --> 03:01:39,830
Actually, go for this one.

4511
03:01:40,990 --> 03:01:42,290
My cars died.

4512
03:01:43,550 --> 03:01:44,610
So sad.

4513
03:01:48,310 --> 03:01:50,530
This is the car I lent to you.

4514
03:01:51,230 --> 03:01:52,410
Make two more!

4515
03:01:52,650 --> 03:01:53,250
Two more!

4516
03:01:54,770 --> 03:01:57,670
Probably getting the AI on hard wasn't the best idea yet.

4517
03:01:57,710 --> 03:01:58,870
I don't know what you guys were thinking.

4518
03:02:00,530 --> 03:02:02,610
You know, we...

4519
03:02:03,490 --> 03:02:06,290
I said a challenge, so...

4520
03:02:07,010 --> 03:02:09,350
Honestly, it's fine.

4521
03:02:12,430 --> 03:02:13,710
No, no, no relic victory.

4522
03:02:13,890 --> 03:02:16,010
I just sent some guys to the monastery.

4523
03:02:16,190 --> 03:02:18,350
He built it like in the very outskirts now.

4524
03:02:19,270 --> 03:02:23,050
You think I'm not gonna get there in time?

4525
03:02:23,530 --> 03:02:25,810
I mean, you could... I don't think there's walls over here.

4526
03:02:25,870 --> 03:02:27,830
I really think you can just like walk around it.

4527
03:02:30,250 --> 03:02:33,450
But there's like a forest where he didn't build walls.

4528
03:02:33,910 --> 03:02:34,430
No, there's not.

4529
03:02:34,550 --> 03:02:36,890
But all the way around it... Yeah, maybe, maybe.

4530
03:02:37,090 --> 03:02:38,430
No, you can just walk over to it.

4531
03:02:38,430 --> 03:02:43,810
I guess so, but we'll have to kill some... Destroy some buildings anyway to make pressure.

4532
03:02:44,410 --> 03:02:46,890
Yeah, see, you have a guy already coming through to it.

4533
03:02:47,170 --> 03:02:47,670
A couple of them.

4534
03:02:48,090 --> 03:02:49,130
Fight the power.

4535
03:02:49,510 --> 03:02:50,310
I'll make some too.

4536
03:02:51,730 --> 03:02:52,050
Yeah?

4537
03:02:52,410 --> 03:02:52,670
Yeah.

4538
03:02:53,050 --> 03:02:53,650
Some what?

4539
03:02:55,170 --> 03:02:56,130
Some, some...

4540
03:02:56,910 --> 03:02:59,530
Regular things, not...

4541
03:02:59,530 --> 03:03:01,150
I have... Oh, elephants, elephants.

4542
03:03:01,450 --> 03:03:02,150
I can make elephants.

4543
03:03:05,310 --> 03:03:06,930
I'm coming to join the fray!

4544
03:03:06,930 --> 03:03:08,410
Yeah, get some elephants!

4545
03:03:09,150 --> 03:03:10,070
I'm joining the fight!

4546
03:03:11,190 --> 03:03:11,410
Yeah!

4547
03:03:11,890 --> 03:03:12,150
Yeah!

4548
03:03:13,030 --> 03:03:15,690
Love to see elephants on the battlefield.

4549
03:03:15,970 --> 03:03:17,750
Totally not traumatic for me.

4550
03:03:17,870 --> 03:03:18,430
No, no, no.

4551
03:03:19,010 --> 03:03:19,510
No, no.

4552
03:03:21,650 --> 03:03:23,210
I don't feel anything.

4553
03:03:23,470 --> 03:03:25,590
Seeing, seeing... Elephants?

4554
03:03:25,770 --> 03:03:26,030
No.

4555
03:03:26,270 --> 03:03:26,510
No.

4556
03:03:27,390 --> 03:03:30,130
Doesn't activate any kind of neurons in me.

4557
03:03:30,290 --> 03:03:30,930
No, it doesn't.

4558
03:03:30,950 --> 03:03:31,410
You're OK.

4559
03:03:34,150 --> 03:03:35,130
I'm fine.

4560
03:03:35,930 --> 03:03:39,480
I love elephants.

4561
03:03:40,060 --> 03:03:40,260
Yeah.

4562
03:03:41,420 --> 03:03:44,100
Alright, we're having everybody join up here.

4563
03:03:45,180 --> 03:03:46,080
Wait, what is this?

4564
03:03:46,140 --> 03:03:46,960
Oh, this is a blacksmith.

4565
03:03:49,840 --> 03:03:52,520
I hear, I hear you guys in battle.

4566
03:03:53,560 --> 03:03:54,740
I hear it.

4567
03:03:55,880 --> 03:03:57,480
I hear it, I hear it.

4568
03:03:57,700 --> 03:03:58,120
Scary.

4569
03:03:59,140 --> 03:03:59,740
Hoardings?

4570
03:03:59,740 --> 03:04:00,340
What's a hoard?

4571
03:04:00,960 --> 03:04:02,180
Battle is scary.

4572
03:04:02,860 --> 03:04:03,780
Very scary.

4573
03:04:04,380 --> 03:04:05,600
Nothing fun about it.

4574
03:04:08,780 --> 03:04:10,980
When, when we...

4575
03:04:13,240 --> 03:04:14,620
Control of relics was lost!

4576
03:04:18,080 --> 03:04:19,280
Attack her!

4577
03:04:22,400 --> 03:04:22,700
OK.

4578
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:24,320
Oh, we should get rid of that.

4579
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:27,460
He's building there.

4580
03:04:32,360 --> 03:04:35,580
How long is it gonna take him to...

4581
03:04:36,460 --> 03:04:37,520
Give up?

4582
03:04:38,700 --> 03:04:39,300
Wait.

4583
03:04:39,740 --> 03:04:40,700
Siege tower.

4584
03:04:42,520 --> 03:04:43,660
Where are my elephants?

4585
03:04:46,500 --> 03:04:47,640
Hurry up, elephants!

4586
03:04:47,700 --> 03:04:49,500
I have seven elephants coming in hot.

4587
03:04:53,500 --> 03:04:57,500
I hope I don't accidentally bomb them.

4588
03:04:59,420 --> 03:05:01,800
Because they're quite thick.

4589
03:05:03,860 --> 03:05:05,980
Oh, I didn't know that was a copy-paste.

4590
03:05:09,320 --> 03:05:10,460
It's OK, guys.

4591
03:05:10,500 --> 03:05:11,240
Don't worry.

4592
03:05:13,060 --> 03:05:14,140
What was the copy-paste?

4593
03:05:15,360 --> 03:05:18,380
Just being like, you cheated and didn't learn anything.

4594
03:05:19,680 --> 03:05:21,300
Were they saying that to you?

4595
03:05:21,600 --> 03:05:22,460
No, but it's OK.

4596
03:05:22,640 --> 03:05:23,160
I think it's...

4597
03:05:23,160 --> 03:05:24,240
They don't mean it like that.

4598
03:05:24,780 --> 03:05:25,900
It's OK, guys.

4599
03:05:28,900 --> 03:05:30,540
He's so done for.

4600
03:05:31,520 --> 03:05:32,940
But I'm gonna get those.

4601
03:05:34,040 --> 03:05:35,520
They have a lot of stuff though.

4602
03:05:35,520 --> 03:05:37,500
Oh, you got the relics down.

4603
03:05:37,540 --> 03:05:37,740
OK.

4604
03:05:38,840 --> 03:05:40,020
What is this thing?

4605
03:05:46,640 --> 03:05:47,920
They're so distracted.

4606
03:05:48,080 --> 03:05:50,280
They don't know that a second army is coming in.

4607
03:05:50,400 --> 03:05:51,820
I wish this... Come on, elephants!

4608
03:05:51,960 --> 03:05:52,560
Come faster!

4609
03:05:54,580 --> 03:05:55,900
Be burst now.

4610
03:05:56,340 --> 03:05:56,480
Wait!

4611
03:06:00,300 --> 03:06:02,140
I just made the elephant.

4612
03:06:02,860 --> 03:06:03,820
Game over!

4613
03:06:06,660 --> 03:06:07,700
I survived,

4614
03:06:12,260 --> 03:06:12,840
everybody.

4615
03:06:13,900 --> 03:06:17,800
I wonder if we had him on one lower difficulty.

4616
03:06:18,240 --> 03:06:19,060
I think so, yeah.

4617
03:06:19,080 --> 03:06:20,520
If we would have been able to do it.

4618
03:06:20,740 --> 03:06:21,960
I think so, too.

4619
03:06:22,040 --> 03:06:23,920
He was just so aggressive to me.

4620
03:06:24,040 --> 03:06:25,020
I couldn't do anything.

4621
03:06:27,720 --> 03:06:29,040
How does this make you feel?

4622
03:06:29,100 --> 03:06:32,020
Does this make you feel like you wanna get better at the game so you can handle...

4623
03:06:32,780 --> 03:06:35,120
Perhaps even a one versus one against the AI?

4624
03:06:40,860 --> 03:06:41,220
No?

4625
03:06:41,640 --> 03:06:41,760
No, yeah.

4626
03:06:41,980 --> 03:06:42,900
No, I think so.

4627
03:06:43,540 --> 03:06:44,760
You just wanna cheat now, huh?

4628
03:06:49,440 --> 03:06:51,180
I do wanna get good again.

4629
03:06:51,280 --> 03:06:51,660
I do.

4630
03:06:52,500 --> 03:06:53,440
You have to train me.

4631
03:06:53,480 --> 03:06:55,000
You have to get good and then you train me.

4632
03:06:55,780 --> 03:06:58,220
But who will train me?

4633
03:06:58,540 --> 03:07:02,340
I once did... It was off stream, but I did like me versus...

4634
03:07:03,160 --> 03:07:04,000
Three... No.

4635
03:07:05,340 --> 03:07:06,800
No, it was 2v2.

4636
03:07:07,760 --> 03:07:10,980
The achievements did not progress this game because cheat codes were used.

4637
03:07:12,200 --> 03:07:13,800
What do you mean progress though?

4638
03:07:13,860 --> 03:07:16,000
I guess it doesn't count to my...

4639
03:07:17,600 --> 03:07:18,680
Overall count?

4640
03:07:18,980 --> 03:07:20,380
You did it, Kiai.

4641
03:07:20,400 --> 03:07:21,560
You did us, actually.

4642
03:07:22,860 --> 03:07:23,420
Wait.

4643
03:07:25,060 --> 03:07:27,700
They're giving you the military star.

4644
03:07:28,740 --> 03:07:30,420
Is it because of the cost?

4645
03:07:32,140 --> 03:07:34,020
You killed 531 units?

4646
03:07:34,820 --> 03:07:36,440
Girl, I had to!

4647
03:07:36,860 --> 03:07:38,140
I had to!

4648
03:07:38,700 --> 03:07:42,840
They were actually just coming after me like nothing else.

4649
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,020
Jeez, but I still have the largest army.

4650
03:07:47,200 --> 03:07:47,920
Wow.

4651
03:07:48,540 --> 03:07:51,400
That's how often they were coming after me.

4652
03:07:51,400 --> 03:07:55,460
He collected so much wood and so much... Secretly!

4653
03:07:55,840 --> 03:07:56,540
That bastard!

4654
03:07:57,460 --> 03:07:58,380
Oh my gosh!

4655
03:07:59,320 --> 03:08:01,500
Yeah, it was our wood and our gold.

4656
03:08:03,600 --> 03:08:06,340
It's still not as important as I thought it was.

4657
03:08:06,900 --> 03:08:11,140
No, it is, especially for building many castles and stuff and walls and everything.

4658
03:08:11,860 --> 03:08:16,520
I think really every map is as important as the other.

4659
03:08:17,140 --> 03:08:19,280
I straggled in everything, guys.

4660
03:08:21,420 --> 03:08:22,000
Beautiful.

4661
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:24,580
Beautiful.

4662
03:08:25,520 --> 03:08:29,320
Oh, he did get quite a bit of gold from just having the relics.

4663
03:08:29,720 --> 03:08:31,060
Oh yeah, that's gonna happen.

4664
03:08:31,360 --> 03:08:32,080
In the monastery.

4665
03:08:35,020 --> 03:08:36,340
I see, I see.

4666
03:08:36,460 --> 03:08:38,140
Oh, look at this beautiful graph.

4667
03:08:42,220 --> 03:08:44,670
Finn, you are...

4668
03:08:44,920 --> 03:08:49,820
Even though you have all these military achievements...

4669
03:08:50,300 --> 03:08:53,100
I was just constantly under attack.

4670
03:08:53,500 --> 03:08:56,420
He would just come every couple minutes and attack me.

4671
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:59,480
Yeah, it's really kind of unfair.

4672
03:08:59,600 --> 03:09:01,140
I don't know why he kept on going to you.

4673
03:09:02,300 --> 03:09:05,860
Maybe the AI kind of knows, although it would be kind of unfair.

4674
03:09:05,980 --> 03:09:09,760
But maybe the AI knew that you were kind of behind a little bit.

4675
03:09:09,800 --> 03:09:11,680
And then chooses the one who's behind.

4676
03:09:12,280 --> 03:09:15,860
But I feel like that would be unfair, because a normal player wouldn't know that either.

4677
03:09:15,980 --> 03:09:18,820
So I don't think they would program him like that.

4678
03:09:18,820 --> 03:09:20,740
I think I was just so close.

4679
03:09:20,780 --> 03:09:22,540
I think I was just super duper close to him.

4680
03:09:23,620 --> 03:09:24,900
He was in the middle.

4681
03:09:25,160 --> 03:09:26,520
I wanna watch him play.

4682
03:09:26,980 --> 03:09:27,740
I wanna see his...

4683
03:09:27,740 --> 03:09:28,620
You wanna watch him play?

4684
03:09:28,640 --> 03:09:29,880
I wanna see his...

4685
03:09:29,880 --> 03:09:31,000
I wanna see his strats.

4686
03:09:31,420 --> 03:09:33,420
If he's a computer, he knows the best strats.

4687
03:09:33,640 --> 03:09:34,060
No, no, no.

4688
03:09:34,400 --> 03:09:38,940
Actually, if you wanna learn, watch actual good AOE players play.

4689
03:09:39,140 --> 03:09:42,660
They're so fast though, you kind of have to slow down...

4690
03:09:42,660 --> 03:09:45,020
Yeah, 25% speed.

4691
03:09:46,800 --> 03:09:50,520
And they know all the hotkeys and everything, and the min-maxing and everything.

4692
03:09:50,600 --> 03:09:53,880
But it's really cool, and some things you can really learn from that, for sure.

4693
03:09:54,960 --> 03:09:55,840
Like the order.

4694
03:09:56,160 --> 03:09:58,100
And you can watch these beginner videos.

4695
03:09:58,460 --> 03:10:01,680
Like, what's the first couple things, the first couple steps that you should do.

4696
03:10:02,240 --> 03:10:04,320
You know, how do you min-max everything.

4697
03:10:04,760 --> 03:10:06,040
You can min-max it so hard.

4698
03:10:06,040 --> 03:10:13,420
When you start off with 3 villagers or so, 2 have to do exactly this, and 1 has to do exactly this.

4699
03:10:13,580 --> 03:10:19,720
And you have to bait the boars in exactly this way, in exactly this amount of time.

4700
03:10:20,480 --> 03:10:22,060
It has to be perfect, but...

4701
03:10:22,060 --> 03:10:28,220
I think what I want from this, or rather, I play this game, and then what it makes me wanna play is like...

4702
03:10:28,220 --> 03:10:31,820
Like a farming simulator, like Stardew Valley.

4703
03:10:32,280 --> 03:10:32,280
Yeah, right?

4704
03:10:32,280 --> 03:10:32,680
You know?

4705
03:10:33,040 --> 03:10:33,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4706
03:10:33,780 --> 03:10:35,160
I was saying that too in the beginning.

4707
03:10:35,160 --> 03:10:40,500
Like, I'm enjoying it up until the point where the battle begins.

4708
03:10:40,920 --> 03:10:42,060
That's when I panic.

4709
03:10:42,180 --> 03:10:45,800
I don't mind the battle, I don't mind the pillaging, but it's like...

4710
03:10:45,800 --> 03:10:51,080
I think I would have to just really learn how to...

4711
03:10:51,080 --> 03:10:54,920
Because obviously, like with this, I just fell behind entirely.

4712
03:10:55,040 --> 03:10:56,720
You just gotta lower the difficulty.

4713
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:58,380
This was way too high for us.

4714
03:10:58,500 --> 03:10:59,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4715
03:11:00,160 --> 03:11:02,940
Is Civ more farming?

4716
03:11:03,420 --> 03:11:04,940
Like more...

4717
03:11:04,940 --> 03:11:06,120
Don't know.

4718
03:11:06,400 --> 03:11:07,780
Because people are recommending it.

4719
03:11:07,900 --> 03:11:10,160
Civilization might be more your thing, is what people are saying.

4720
03:11:10,740 --> 03:11:11,120
Have you played?

4721
03:11:12,300 --> 03:11:14,400
No, but like, I don't know.

4722
03:11:14,580 --> 03:11:17,560
If I were to get good, I would enjoy the battle.

4723
03:11:17,760 --> 03:11:18,920
I just need to get good.

4724
03:11:19,380 --> 03:11:20,240
Oh, I don't like turn-based.

4725
03:11:20,660 --> 03:11:21,020
What?

4726
03:11:21,140 --> 03:11:21,680
Turn-based?

4727
03:11:21,860 --> 03:11:22,660
I don't like turn-based.

4728
03:11:25,860 --> 03:11:28,620
You can both play the same civilization and divide...

4729
03:11:28,620 --> 03:11:29,980
Oh, right.

4730
03:11:30,200 --> 03:11:32,600
We could, but that feels a little bit complicated.

4731
03:11:33,340 --> 03:11:35,440
To be like, oh, you do this, you do that.

4732
03:11:35,800 --> 03:11:36,220
I don't know.

4733
03:11:37,760 --> 03:11:38,840
No, this was fine.

4734
03:11:38,980 --> 03:11:39,440
This was fine.

4735
03:11:39,580 --> 03:11:40,260
This was fun.

4736
03:11:40,300 --> 03:11:40,940
It was fun.

4737
03:11:43,760 --> 03:11:45,860
And we don't need to play too seriously.

4738
03:11:46,300 --> 03:11:48,180
It's like, in the end, it's about fun, right?

4739
03:11:48,300 --> 03:11:51,660
We don't need to be like, oh, no cheating, no cars, because...

4740
03:11:51,660 --> 03:11:52,960
What other cheats are there?

4741
03:11:53,980 --> 03:11:57,640
Oh, there's this one donkey or whatever it is that's so funny.

4742
03:11:58,280 --> 03:11:59,820
I wish you would've seen it.

4743
03:12:00,260 --> 03:12:02,500
You should try if you play again sometime.

4744
03:12:02,920 --> 03:12:03,180
Okay.

4745
03:12:04,140 --> 03:12:04,740
I'll try.

4746
03:12:05,480 --> 03:12:07,640
Why is he funny?

4747
03:12:08,800 --> 03:12:09,340
Spawns a monkey.

4748
03:12:09,340 --> 03:12:11,440
He says so many funny things.

4749
03:12:11,800 --> 03:12:12,420
He speaks?

4750
03:12:12,460 --> 03:12:13,420
The super donkey.

4751
03:12:13,800 --> 03:12:14,560
He's like a king.

4752
03:12:14,680 --> 03:12:15,680
I think he has a crown.

4753
03:12:16,260 --> 03:12:18,280
Wait, I think I remember that.

4754
03:12:19,020 --> 03:12:21,320
Oh, it was an alpaca, not a donkey.

4755
03:12:23,820 --> 03:12:24,260
Yeah.

4756
03:12:25,260 --> 03:12:26,580
There's a naked guy?

4757
03:12:27,780 --> 03:12:28,020
Wait.

4758
03:12:28,500 --> 03:12:29,400
I don't think I saw the naked guy.

4759
03:12:29,400 --> 03:12:33,840
Do you wanna try a map where we can speedrun killing the people with only cheat guys?

4760
03:12:36,260 --> 03:12:37,860
But you wanna do it now or another time?

4761
03:12:39,060 --> 03:12:40,220
Now, if we speedrun.

4762
03:12:40,860 --> 03:12:41,120
Now?

4763
03:12:41,260 --> 03:12:41,480
Okay.

4764
03:12:44,780 --> 03:12:47,420
Okay, speedrun with cheats.

4765
03:12:47,420 --> 03:12:49,260
Yeah, but I wanna see the cheats.

4766
03:12:49,980 --> 03:12:52,260
Yeah, you guys are gonna teach us all the cheats.

4767
03:12:52,520 --> 03:12:53,700
Teach us the cheats.

4768
03:12:56,100 --> 03:12:57,500
Cheat run, cheat run.

4769
03:13:00,680 --> 03:13:03,840
So we'll still... Should we just do the same map and everything?

4770
03:13:04,020 --> 03:13:04,500
Same, same?

4771
03:13:04,540 --> 03:13:05,120
Yeah, why not?

4772
03:13:06,160 --> 03:13:06,800
Difficulty also?

4773
03:13:07,720 --> 03:13:08,080
Sure.

4774
03:13:08,780 --> 03:13:12,420
Yeah, same difficulty and then we'll like, you know, we'll have the cheats and we'll just be...

4775
03:13:13,800 --> 03:13:14,580
It will be over.

4776
03:13:14,960 --> 03:13:15,940
Yeah, it will be over.

4777
03:13:15,940 --> 03:13:18,660
We'll end his suffering as quickly as possible.

4778
03:13:18,780 --> 03:13:19,600
Did you get the invite?

4779
03:13:19,940 --> 03:13:20,440
Yeah, I did.

4780
03:13:20,640 --> 03:13:20,940
I'm in.

4781
03:13:21,420 --> 03:13:21,580
Okay.

4782
03:13:21,900 --> 03:13:25,560
He won't get to like any... He won't get past feudal age.

4783
03:13:25,680 --> 03:13:26,940
He'll be just...

4784
03:13:30,400 --> 03:13:32,040
No advancing in this run.

4785
03:13:32,360 --> 03:13:32,520
None.

4786
03:13:32,860 --> 03:13:34,300
I'm still gonna be random though.

4787
03:13:35,900 --> 03:13:36,280
Okay.

4788
03:13:37,220 --> 03:13:38,160
Who will I be?

4789
03:13:38,700 --> 03:13:39,480
Oh, what color?

4790
03:13:39,840 --> 03:13:40,220
Green?

4791
03:13:40,500 --> 03:13:41,100
Yeah, I'm green.

4792
03:13:41,420 --> 03:13:42,120
And you're orange.

4793
03:13:42,360 --> 03:13:43,800
Oh, I should be orange, yeah.

4794
03:13:44,840 --> 03:13:46,240
Orange it is.

4795
03:13:46,800 --> 03:13:48,800
I think we're ready.

4796
03:13:48,960 --> 03:13:49,100
Okay.

4797
03:13:49,280 --> 03:13:49,460
Okay.

4798
03:13:49,600 --> 03:13:51,460
What cheats are there?

4799
03:13:52,580 --> 03:13:54,880
What's the alpaca?

4800
03:13:58,900 --> 03:13:59,500
Alpaca.

4801
03:13:59,700 --> 03:14:01,240
Is he super strong?

4802
03:14:02,100 --> 03:14:02,780
Is he...

4803
03:14:02,780 --> 03:14:04,440
Yeah, he's pretty alright.

4804
03:14:05,360 --> 03:14:07,180
Oh, I'm the Mayans now.

4805
03:14:10,100 --> 03:14:12,580
I don't think the Mayans are in the desert.

4806
03:14:14,440 --> 03:14:14,960
Okay.

4807
03:14:15,320 --> 03:14:16,260
What do I put in?

4808
03:14:16,980 --> 03:14:17,500
Catzor.

4809
03:14:18,280 --> 03:14:19,280
What does that do?

4810
03:14:21,320 --> 03:14:22,180
Oh my god.

4811
03:14:23,020 --> 03:14:24,080
Oh my god!

4812
03:14:25,940 --> 03:14:26,460
Wait...

4813
03:14:26,460 --> 03:14:28,180
Wait, Kiara, you have to put that in.

4814
03:14:29,100 --> 03:14:29,620
What?

4815
03:14:29,920 --> 03:14:31,180
Put in Catzor.

4816
03:14:32,420 --> 03:14:33,400
I know that one.

4817
03:14:33,640 --> 03:14:34,000
You do?

4818
03:14:34,620 --> 03:14:35,400
It's so cute.

4819
03:14:35,440 --> 03:14:35,920
Wait, but...

4820
03:14:35,920 --> 03:14:37,580
Was it with Zep?

4821
03:14:38,100 --> 03:14:38,500
Yeah.

4822
03:14:38,580 --> 03:14:38,840
Yes.

4823
03:14:39,220 --> 03:14:41,260
You should put in Alpaca Simulator.

4824
03:14:44,220 --> 03:14:45,100
Alpaca Simulator.

4825
03:14:46,260 --> 03:14:47,020
Is it him?

4826
03:14:48,120 --> 03:14:48,500
Yeah!

4827
03:14:51,440 --> 03:14:51,960
Black Death?

4828
03:14:52,080 --> 03:14:52,360
What is that?

4829
03:14:52,420 --> 03:14:53,760
Does it just instantly end the game?

4830
03:14:54,060 --> 03:14:54,340
Move!

4831
03:14:58,260 --> 03:15:00,060
I don't move, you move.

4832
03:15:00,540 --> 03:15:02,000
Oh, there's random elephants here.

4833
03:15:02,780 --> 03:15:03,440
What else, guys?

4834
03:15:03,880 --> 03:15:04,160
What else?

4835
03:15:04,220 --> 03:15:05,020
Yeah, I like him.

4836
03:15:05,400 --> 03:15:06,160
His name is Alfred.

4837
03:15:07,180 --> 03:15:07,640
What else?

4838
03:15:09,380 --> 03:15:09,820
Alfred!

4839
03:15:09,820 --> 03:15:13,080
Oh, Black Death just ends the game, so don't do that one.

4840
03:15:13,080 --> 03:15:14,020
Ok, we don't want that.

4841
03:15:14,200 --> 03:15:14,800
Yeah, yeah.

4842
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:16,040
Oh shit!

4843
03:15:16,160 --> 03:15:17,040
My resources.

4844
03:15:17,940 --> 03:15:18,180
Huh?

4845
03:15:19,400 --> 03:15:23,160
I got like 100,000 resources of everything with a cheat code.

4846
03:15:23,280 --> 03:15:23,860
Wait, how?

4847
03:15:26,240 --> 03:15:28,040
Typing in Ninja Loody.

4848
03:15:28,360 --> 03:15:29,580
Don't exist.

4849
03:15:30,880 --> 03:15:31,520
What's this?

4850
03:15:31,700 --> 03:15:32,300
What did I do?

4851
03:15:33,780 --> 03:15:34,400
Photon Man.

4852
03:15:35,020 --> 03:15:35,540
Ninja...

4853
03:15:35,540 --> 03:15:35,880
What?

4854
03:15:36,060 --> 03:15:36,340
Loody?

4855
03:15:37,160 --> 03:15:37,780
Oh, Louie.

4856
03:15:40,520 --> 03:15:43,600
How many...we don't even need that many, I think.

4857
03:15:44,080 --> 03:15:46,280
Ninja Louie.

4858
03:15:49,980 --> 03:15:51,300
Oh, that doesn't work.

4859
03:15:53,120 --> 03:15:54,160
I have a penguin!

4860
03:15:54,560 --> 03:15:55,840
Oh my god, he's so cute!

4861
03:15:56,440 --> 03:15:57,060
What penguin?

4862
03:15:57,240 --> 03:15:57,460
How?

4863
03:15:57,560 --> 03:15:58,020
What color?

4864
03:15:58,320 --> 03:15:59,360
What was that, guys?

4865
03:15:59,420 --> 03:16:00,100
What was that?

4866
03:16:01,380 --> 03:16:02,480
I don't remember.

4867
03:16:05,800 --> 03:16:06,760
Torpedo 2.

4868
03:16:07,760 --> 03:16:08,700
Torpedo 2.

4869
03:16:09,480 --> 03:16:11,080
We can build anything we want now.

4870
03:16:12,560 --> 03:16:14,160
Oh, it was I don't exist.

4871
03:16:14,280 --> 03:16:15,200
I don't exist.

4872
03:16:16,400 --> 03:16:17,620
Look how cute he is!

4873
03:16:17,800 --> 03:16:19,260
I don't exist.

4874
03:16:19,960 --> 03:16:20,740
Natural wonders?

4875
03:16:21,200 --> 03:16:22,160
Natural wonders.

4876
03:16:22,700 --> 03:16:25,200
He exists now, but he shouldn't be existing in this desert.

4877
03:16:26,380 --> 03:16:27,040
What did it do?

4878
03:16:27,040 --> 03:16:27,660
Is he even strong?

4879
03:16:29,420 --> 03:16:31,780
How many do you want to create until we go?

4880
03:16:33,700 --> 03:16:34,940
What did that do?

4881
03:16:35,800 --> 03:16:36,000
What?

4882
03:16:36,800 --> 03:16:37,620
What did that do?

4883
03:16:37,620 --> 03:16:38,700
Why am I getting something that I'm not seeing?

4884
03:16:40,080 --> 03:16:41,000
Don't torpedo.

4885
03:16:42,040 --> 03:16:43,520
I need more houses.

4886
03:16:43,520 --> 03:16:45,960
I love the monkey head.

4887
03:16:46,020 --> 03:16:46,980
Wait, I need more houses.

4888
03:16:47,740 --> 03:16:49,280
Oh, that's a naked guy!

4889
03:16:50,220 --> 03:16:51,400
It's not a naked guy.

4890
03:16:52,480 --> 03:16:53,400
He's fast!

4891
03:16:54,540 --> 03:16:55,640
What is he?

4892
03:16:56,760 --> 03:16:59,800
I'm gonna send him through the map and make him scout for me.

4893
03:17:00,840 --> 03:17:02,040
He has good voice lines too.

4894
03:17:03,460 --> 03:17:04,540
What the heck is that?

4895
03:17:05,160 --> 03:17:05,960
What is that?

4896
03:17:08,100 --> 03:17:08,440
Marco...

4897
03:17:08,440 --> 03:17:08,780
What is that?

4898
03:17:08,920 --> 03:17:09,840
Did you send that?

4899
03:17:10,080 --> 03:17:10,640
What did I send?

4900
03:17:12,540 --> 03:17:15,180
There is a flying dog.

4901
03:17:18,260 --> 03:17:20,380
But it must have been from a cheat code.

4902
03:17:23,040 --> 03:17:24,240
Guys, I got the Catzor.

4903
03:17:25,060 --> 03:17:26,620
In fact, they are gonna go scouting for me.

4904
03:17:31,140 --> 03:17:31,800
What the hell?

4905
03:17:31,880 --> 03:17:32,780
Oh, I see the dog!

4906
03:17:33,240 --> 03:17:33,960
What is that?

4907
03:17:33,960 --> 03:17:34,240
Yeah!

4908
03:17:35,580 --> 03:17:38,040
And he has a red cape, so...

4909
03:17:38,040 --> 03:17:40,860
Is he on the other guy's side?

4910
03:17:42,260 --> 03:17:42,800
Oh my God!

4911
03:17:49,790 --> 03:17:51,660
What was the car again?

4912
03:17:51,860 --> 03:17:54,300
How do you turn this on?

4913
03:17:55,380 --> 03:17:56,180
Oh yeah.

4914
03:17:56,360 --> 03:18:01,120
Oh, I found red.

4915
03:18:01,820 --> 03:18:02,240
You did?

4916
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:03,720
Where is he?

4917
03:18:03,800 --> 03:18:04,800
Is he close to you?

4918
03:18:04,820 --> 03:18:06,780
He's on the left side of the map.

4919
03:18:06,980 --> 03:18:08,160
Ok, I'm heading over.

4920
03:18:09,240 --> 03:18:11,140
Oh, this guy doesn't seem to fight.

4921
03:18:12,620 --> 03:18:13,900
He's just for scouting.

4922
03:18:14,200 --> 03:18:14,980
I'm heading over.

4923
03:18:16,860 --> 03:18:18,520
He advanced to the castle already!

4924
03:18:19,320 --> 03:18:21,340
Yeah, isn't he faster than before?

4925
03:18:21,480 --> 03:18:21,800
Yeah!

4926
03:18:22,520 --> 03:18:26,060
I mean, I know we are like busy being crooky, but like, come on!

4927
03:18:27,860 --> 03:18:28,840
Left side.

4928
03:18:28,960 --> 03:18:30,460
I kind of made a peepee with the map.

4929
03:18:30,540 --> 03:18:30,920
I'm sorry.

4930
03:18:34,020 --> 03:18:35,160
Don't look at it.

4931
03:18:35,560 --> 03:18:36,740
Don't look at everybody.

4932
03:18:38,700 --> 03:18:42,000
I'll send my small tiny baby army also over.

4933
03:18:42,700 --> 03:18:43,580
Imperial Age!

4934
03:18:44,020 --> 03:18:45,300
Wait, how is this happening?

4935
03:18:50,660 --> 03:18:52,000
Where is he?

4936
03:18:52,000 --> 03:18:53,620
He's already...

4937
03:18:53,620 --> 03:18:57,660
He has...He's using Jeets too!

4938
03:18:58,580 --> 03:19:00,080
This is unfair!

4939
03:19:01,500 --> 03:19:03,980
Because of...Oh, it affects him too?

4940
03:19:05,360 --> 03:19:06,080
No!

4941
03:19:10,360 --> 03:19:11,540
You can't let him!

4942
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:12,960
I'm getting his ass!

4943
03:19:13,020 --> 03:19:14,220
I'm already attacking him!

4944
03:19:15,720 --> 03:19:16,700
I'm coming.

4945
03:19:16,820 --> 03:19:17,180
I'm coming.

4946
03:19:18,880 --> 03:19:19,480
Eh?

4947
03:19:19,680 --> 03:19:23,900
Does that mean maybe the cars that you spawned also affected him in the previous play?

4948
03:19:24,080 --> 03:19:27,160
Or maybe it was specific cheat codes that we used?

4949
03:19:27,660 --> 03:19:28,300
I don't know.

4950
03:19:29,460 --> 03:19:31,060
I'm attacking a castle now.

4951
03:19:31,460 --> 03:19:32,740
He has a castle already?

4952
03:19:33,580 --> 03:19:33,960
Yeah.

4953
03:19:35,540 --> 03:19:36,800
Can I not advance?

4954
03:19:36,900 --> 03:19:39,020
Oh well.

4955
03:19:40,380 --> 03:19:40,860
Oh my god!

4956
03:19:40,880 --> 03:19:41,460
Oh my!

4957
03:19:41,780 --> 03:19:41,980
No!

4958
03:19:43,620 --> 03:19:45,380
He's so fast!

4959
03:19:45,380 --> 03:19:46,020
Why?

4960
03:19:46,620 --> 03:19:47,920
Who told us to do this cheat?

4961
03:19:48,760 --> 03:19:50,320
Who told us to do this cheat?

4962
03:19:50,720 --> 03:19:51,280
Which one?

4963
03:19:51,340 --> 03:19:52,080
Which one though?

4964
03:19:52,120 --> 03:19:53,200
The instant build.

4965
03:19:53,340 --> 03:19:54,460
He has instant build.

4966
03:19:54,700 --> 03:19:56,760
So that's why he's getting so much stuff so fast.

4967
03:19:57,600 --> 03:19:58,920
Was it one that you entered?

4968
03:20:00,260 --> 03:20:02,400
Yeah, but I didn't know it would affect him!

4969
03:20:04,100 --> 03:20:05,500
Type it again to turn it off.

4970
03:20:07,660 --> 03:20:08,320
Oh god!

4971
03:20:08,360 --> 03:20:10,280
It's a fucking insta build.

4972
03:20:10,780 --> 03:20:11,120
It's ok.

4973
03:20:11,200 --> 03:20:11,680
I turned it off.

4974
03:20:11,760 --> 03:20:12,280
I turned it off.

4975
03:20:19,270 --> 03:20:20,630
What's an easy one?

4976
03:20:21,830 --> 03:20:22,670
No, no, no!

4977
03:20:22,690 --> 03:20:22,890
Attack!

4978
03:20:23,030 --> 03:20:23,710
Attack this one!

4979
03:20:24,230 --> 03:20:24,410
You!

4980
03:20:24,570 --> 03:20:24,770
You!

4981
03:20:24,970 --> 03:20:25,830
Stupid right here!

4982
03:20:26,210 --> 03:20:26,670
Turn around.

4983
03:20:26,730 --> 03:20:27,210
There we go.

4984
03:20:30,210 --> 03:20:30,650
Alright.

4985
03:20:30,950 --> 03:20:33,230
Even just my free units are handling it.

4986
03:20:33,270 --> 03:20:34,190
Oh my god!

4987
03:20:34,210 --> 03:20:35,310
They have so many houses!

4988
03:20:36,810 --> 03:20:38,270
I'm leaving them alone for now.

4989
03:20:38,390 --> 03:20:38,970
I'm retreating.

4990
03:20:39,050 --> 03:20:39,630
I'm retreating.

4991
03:20:40,610 --> 03:20:41,090
Retreating?

4992
03:20:41,410 --> 03:20:42,030
For what?

4993
03:20:42,470 --> 03:20:43,970
Because I want you to fight too.

4994
03:20:45,230 --> 03:20:46,210
I'm already fighting.

4995
03:20:46,290 --> 03:20:46,650
It's ok.

4996
03:20:46,650 --> 03:20:47,370
Oh you are?

4997
03:20:47,810 --> 03:20:48,230
Oh my god!

4998
03:20:48,250 --> 03:20:49,730
They have so much!

4999
03:20:50,610 --> 03:20:52,530
How do they have so much already?

5000
03:20:53,890 --> 03:20:55,030
What the hell?

5001
03:20:55,350 --> 03:20:56,790
What's another cheat we can do guys?

5002
03:20:59,030 --> 03:21:00,870
Why can I not advance?

5003
03:21:02,110 --> 03:21:02,710
What the heck?

5004
03:21:02,930 --> 03:21:05,490
I need two Dark Age buildings.

5005
03:21:06,090 --> 03:21:07,030
I don't have them?

5006
03:21:07,850 --> 03:21:09,250
Is this not Dark Age?

5007
03:21:09,370 --> 03:21:09,950
What the heck?

5008
03:21:10,950 --> 03:21:11,490
Oh duh.

5009
03:21:12,470 --> 03:21:13,970
We'll do whatever.

5010
03:21:19,210 --> 03:21:19,650
Marco?

5011
03:21:20,110 --> 03:21:23,810
Wait, you guys are telling me stuff, but I don't know what you guys are...

5012
03:21:23,810 --> 03:21:25,190
I already tried telling you.

5013
03:21:25,250 --> 03:21:25,590
Marco?

5014
03:21:25,950 --> 03:21:26,390
Polo?

5015
03:21:26,550 --> 03:21:28,310
I don't remember that.

5016
03:21:28,630 --> 03:21:30,470
I don't know what it does though.

5017
03:21:32,750 --> 03:21:33,410
Map reveal?

5018
03:21:33,430 --> 03:21:34,110
I tried it though.

5019
03:21:34,930 --> 03:21:36,950
I see the flying jaguar!

5020
03:21:38,010 --> 03:21:38,470
The dog?

5021
03:21:39,430 --> 03:21:39,870
Yeah!

5022
03:21:40,250 --> 03:21:41,810
He went wolf when I clicked on him.

5023
03:21:41,930 --> 03:21:43,590
Do I have to do Marco Polo?

5024
03:21:46,370 --> 03:21:47,330
Marco Polo.

5025
03:21:48,070 --> 03:21:49,070
It doesn't work.

5026
03:21:49,330 --> 03:21:49,830
Is that you?

5027
03:21:49,970 --> 03:21:50,530
Oh that's you!

5028
03:21:50,790 --> 03:21:50,890
Hi!

5029
03:21:52,030 --> 03:21:53,030
It doesn't work you guys.

5030
03:21:54,430 --> 03:21:56,150
You guys can see it, it's not revealing.

5031
03:21:56,530 --> 03:21:59,550
Type it Marco Polo.

5032
03:21:59,670 --> 03:22:00,350
It doesn't work.

5033
03:22:02,350 --> 03:22:04,890
Wait, are you here?

5034
03:22:05,550 --> 03:22:06,770
Maybe you have... yeah.

5035
03:22:07,110 --> 03:22:07,770
I'm here.

5036
03:22:08,850 --> 03:22:09,410
What's up?

5037
03:22:09,830 --> 03:22:10,590
Oh I see you!

5038
03:22:11,170 --> 03:22:12,590
Wait, who is this guy?

5039
03:22:14,290 --> 03:22:14,930
Photon Man!

5040
03:22:18,050 --> 03:22:21,070
The cat is flying or the dog is flying again.

5041
03:22:21,870 --> 03:22:23,010
What is he doing?

5042
03:22:23,010 --> 03:22:24,490
What is he doing?

5043
03:22:24,690 --> 03:22:25,570
Is that a scout?

5044
03:22:25,950 --> 03:22:26,670
Oh he has two!

5045
03:22:27,690 --> 03:22:28,630
We gave him a couple.

5046
03:22:28,650 --> 03:22:29,810
Wait, there is some stuff over here.

5047
03:22:30,110 --> 03:22:31,490
There is like a monastery and stuff.

5048
03:22:32,030 --> 03:22:33,710
Ok, ok, I'm coming, I'm coming.

5049
03:22:35,070 --> 03:22:36,770
How do you do the Photon Man?

5050
03:22:38,870 --> 03:22:40,390
Just type in Photon Man.

5051
03:22:41,390 --> 03:22:42,510
Hold on...

5052
03:22:42,510 --> 03:22:43,650
Space in between.

5053
03:22:50,190 --> 03:22:52,870
There is a Photon Man.

5054
03:22:52,970 --> 03:22:53,790
Look at him go!

5055
03:22:55,410 --> 03:22:56,090
I'm advancing.

5056
03:22:58,970 --> 03:23:00,010
You're advancing!

5057
03:23:00,630 --> 03:23:00,910
Yeah.

5058
03:23:06,480 --> 03:23:07,080
Who is attacking?

5059
03:23:13,390 --> 03:23:15,690
Oh they are making elephants!

5060
03:23:15,690 --> 03:23:16,890
They are making elephants.

5061
03:23:17,010 --> 03:23:17,330
I don't know.

5062
03:23:17,910 --> 03:23:24,390
Playing like partially serious and then partially with cheat codes is funnier than just with cheat codes.

5063
03:23:25,190 --> 03:23:26,170
Yeah, I agree.

5064
03:23:26,910 --> 03:23:30,910
Yeah, because it's kind of just like we are just going in and exploding stuff.

5065
03:23:31,990 --> 03:23:34,550
Maybe as an 11 year old or so this would have been fun.

5066
03:23:34,730 --> 03:23:37,070
But I like seeing what the cheat codes are at least.

5067
03:23:37,230 --> 03:23:38,250
Yeah, that's for sure.

5068
03:23:38,430 --> 03:23:39,110
I got a penguin.

5069
03:23:39,690 --> 03:23:40,310
You wanna see him?

5070
03:23:40,430 --> 03:23:41,230
I'm gonna bring him over.

5071
03:23:41,430 --> 03:23:42,570
I already saw him before!

5072
03:23:43,410 --> 03:23:44,090
He's coming!

5073
03:23:44,170 --> 03:23:44,690
He's so cute!

5074
03:23:44,690 --> 03:23:48,030
But he's not meant to be in the desert.

5075
03:23:48,810 --> 03:23:48,830
Poor guy.

5076
03:23:48,830 --> 03:23:49,010
I know!

5077
03:23:49,210 --> 03:23:49,910
This guy!

5078
03:23:50,210 --> 03:23:51,310
Why do you exist here?

5079
03:23:52,470 --> 03:23:55,430
What kind of mods are in for this game?

5080
03:23:57,150 --> 03:23:58,130
Torpedo 8.

5081
03:23:58,270 --> 03:23:58,890
What is that?

5082
03:24:00,230 --> 03:24:00,750
I'm scared.

5083
03:24:01,330 --> 03:24:02,450
Is that all he has?

5084
03:24:02,510 --> 03:24:03,470
Those few more houses?

5085
03:24:03,650 --> 03:24:04,090
Is that it?

5086
03:24:05,390 --> 03:24:06,350
I don't know.

5087
03:24:06,650 --> 03:24:07,690
Seems like...

5088
03:24:09,030 --> 03:24:10,650
Do not use torpedo.

5089
03:24:11,490 --> 03:24:11,810
Okay.

5090
03:24:14,030 --> 03:24:14,670
What?

5091
03:24:14,890 --> 03:24:15,770
What did you... Did you put it?

5092
03:24:16,170 --> 03:24:17,070
Desert penguin.

5093
03:24:17,510 --> 03:24:18,530
I think I did.

5094
03:24:21,890 --> 03:24:22,670
Let's see.

5095
03:24:24,010 --> 03:24:27,270
Two dark ages smashing one imperial age.

5096
03:24:27,650 --> 03:24:28,870
I'm in the feudal age.

5097
03:24:28,910 --> 03:24:30,750
Excuse you, I'm in the feudal age.

5098
03:24:30,810 --> 03:24:31,410
Thank you very much.

5099
03:24:31,750 --> 03:24:35,210
I literally cannot advance to anything.

5100
03:24:36,070 --> 03:24:36,690
This is weird.

5101
03:24:38,710 --> 03:24:39,950
Star Wars mods?

5102
03:24:41,330 --> 03:24:42,630
Furious the monkey boy.

5103
03:24:46,050 --> 03:24:46,650
Well...

5104
03:24:47,450 --> 03:24:48,830
What did that do?

5105
03:24:53,110 --> 03:24:53,710
Monkey!

5106
03:24:54,130 --> 03:24:54,130
Monkey!

5107
03:24:55,290 --> 03:24:56,050
Bring him over!

5108
03:24:56,170 --> 03:24:56,810
Bring him over!

5109
03:24:57,110 --> 03:25:00,750
Before this guy gives up, because it must be soon.

5110
03:25:00,910 --> 03:25:01,670
Soon, right?

5111
03:25:01,930 --> 03:25:02,370
I feel...

5112
03:25:03,710 --> 03:25:04,750
What's the naked man?

5113
03:25:04,770 --> 03:25:06,150
Why is he not giving up yet?

5114
03:25:06,150 --> 03:25:09,030
Maybe there is somewhere a castle hidden.

5115
03:25:09,570 --> 03:25:10,850
I see a relic.

5116
03:25:11,270 --> 03:25:11,770
Where are you?

5117
03:25:11,870 --> 03:25:12,570
I don't see you.

5118
03:25:13,450 --> 03:25:16,630
I'm looking at the edge of the map to see if he has anything.

5119
03:25:17,290 --> 03:25:18,650
No, I don't see your units anymore.

5120
03:25:18,750 --> 03:25:19,210
Did they die?

5121
03:25:20,330 --> 03:25:23,850
I only got my troopers left, I think.

5122
03:25:24,850 --> 03:25:27,150
Oh, I see you.

5123
03:25:29,810 --> 03:25:30,690
Trooper, trooper.

5124
03:25:32,530 --> 03:25:33,810
I love the monkey.

5125
03:25:33,810 --> 03:25:38,470
Maybe one of our cheat codes made it so that he won't give up.

5126
03:25:39,070 --> 03:25:39,810
There he is!

5127
03:25:40,130 --> 03:25:41,330
Oh my god, he's fast!

5128
03:25:45,070 --> 03:25:47,210
That's a good idea.

5129
03:25:48,490 --> 03:25:50,570
He took it out of his vocabulary.

5130
03:25:54,850 --> 03:25:57,130
Is that my guy or is that your guy?

5131
03:25:57,250 --> 03:25:58,750
It's my guy.

5132
03:25:59,570 --> 03:26:02,610
He can't attack though, so he's like the perfect scouting guy.

5133
03:26:02,610 --> 03:26:05,170
Yeah, I wish there was an auto-scout for him.

5134
03:26:05,850 --> 03:26:06,730
Alright, last building.

5135
03:26:07,610 --> 03:26:07,890
Hello?

5136
03:26:08,330 --> 03:26:08,890
I'm gonna build right here.

5137
03:26:10,610 --> 03:26:12,610
We killed his last building.

5138
03:26:13,890 --> 03:26:15,470
No, there's a little bit more.

5139
03:26:15,730 --> 03:26:16,090
Right here.

5140
03:26:16,590 --> 03:26:16,910
Oh really?

5141
03:26:17,930 --> 03:26:18,770
Right where?

5142
03:26:19,990 --> 03:26:21,210
Maybe he's confused.

5143
03:26:21,490 --> 03:26:23,930
I think the AI is like, what are you...

5144
03:26:24,610 --> 03:26:25,910
How did you do this?

5145
03:26:27,350 --> 03:26:31,250
I'm gonna have Naked Man scout the whole map.

5146
03:26:31,250 --> 03:26:33,550
Yeah, please, find something.

5147
03:26:34,210 --> 03:26:35,370
What are we missing?

5148
03:26:36,630 --> 03:26:37,850
I would really like to see that.

5149
03:26:42,310 --> 03:26:43,790
There he goes.

5150
03:26:46,930 --> 03:26:49,150
Make your man go find it.

5151
03:26:49,270 --> 03:26:49,870
Go, go!

5152
03:26:50,350 --> 03:26:52,710
Oh, the lion was attacking him.

5153
03:26:53,050 --> 03:26:53,990
I'm in your village.

5154
03:26:54,150 --> 03:26:54,730
Oh, goat found.

5155
03:26:55,250 --> 03:26:56,950
It's yours, but it's mine now.

5156
03:26:59,490 --> 03:26:59,930
No!

5157
03:26:59,930 --> 03:27:01,590
Find the enemy, not the goat.

5158
03:27:02,270 --> 03:27:03,730
What the heck is the dog?

5159
03:27:06,990 --> 03:27:08,810
I have no idea where it is.

5160
03:27:08,870 --> 03:27:09,890
Maybe the game is bugged.

5161
03:27:09,910 --> 03:27:11,050
I think the game is bugged.

5162
03:27:12,470 --> 03:27:13,710
Oh wait, there it is!

5163
03:27:13,990 --> 03:27:15,130
Ah, there it is!

5164
03:27:15,190 --> 03:27:16,290
It takes a while.

5165
03:27:18,730 --> 03:27:20,910
OK, OK.

5166
03:27:21,850 --> 03:27:23,270
Look at your scores.

5167
03:27:24,670 --> 03:27:25,550
My score...

5168
03:27:27,130 --> 03:27:29,270
You are such a winner.

5169
03:27:31,450 --> 03:27:35,030
It's because we both cheated to get all the resources.

5170
03:27:36,810 --> 03:27:37,870
We are the best!

5171
03:27:37,870 --> 03:27:40,370
100,000 of everything, please.

5172
03:27:40,730 --> 03:27:41,510
We are the best!

5173
03:27:42,270 --> 03:27:47,550
How did he get 52,000 food so fast?

5174
03:27:47,610 --> 03:27:48,890
So fast.

5175
03:27:51,070 --> 03:27:56,270
In the graph, I think I can see where we gave him the ability to insta-build.

5176
03:27:58,650 --> 03:28:01,050
Oh my gosh, he was just like, hello.

5177
03:28:01,590 --> 03:28:04,790
He probably was just like, how do I have this power?

5178
03:28:07,910 --> 03:28:10,510
Yeah, he was building farms like crazy.

5179
03:28:13,130 --> 03:28:14,230
Good for him.

5180
03:28:14,830 --> 03:28:18,370
We gave him a little bit of joy before we took everything away from him.

5181
03:28:18,370 --> 03:28:19,750
Yeah, look at him.

5182
03:28:19,750 --> 03:28:23,310
He spedrunned the feudal age, the castle age, the imperial age.

5183
03:28:24,630 --> 03:28:25,670
That's insane.

5184
03:28:27,490 --> 03:28:28,530
That's insane.

5185
03:28:28,730 --> 03:28:32,550
Dang, I thought I explored a lot of the map, but that guy was crazy.

5186
03:28:36,810 --> 03:28:37,970
Oh my gosh.

5187
03:28:38,410 --> 03:28:39,510
Good stuff, good stuff.

5188
03:28:39,650 --> 03:28:40,030
GG!

5189
03:28:41,310 --> 03:28:42,910
GG, man.

5190
03:28:45,010 --> 03:28:47,590
I'm glad we are playing stuff together.

5191
03:28:47,590 --> 03:28:49,410
We should do more often.

5192
03:28:49,550 --> 03:28:53,670
It doesn't have to be this game, you know, but I want to play more stuff with you.

5193
03:28:54,250 --> 03:28:54,250
Yeah.

5194
03:28:54,630 --> 03:28:58,410
Wait, there was another game that you wanted to do before we suggested this.

5195
03:29:00,570 --> 03:29:02,930
I don't remember, because you were just like, are you free next week?

5196
03:29:02,950 --> 03:29:03,870
I want to play blah blah blah.

5197
03:29:03,990 --> 03:29:04,690
And I was like, yeah!

5198
03:29:04,790 --> 03:29:07,750
And then we got busy, and then we were like, wait, it's the vampires, yeah!

5199
03:29:10,950 --> 03:29:13,290
I don't remember, what could it have been?

5200
03:29:14,030 --> 03:29:14,990
I don't remember either.

5201
03:29:14,990 --> 03:29:17,790
There was something.

5202
03:29:18,910 --> 03:29:21,430
I'm gonna look at our DMs.

5203
03:29:21,610 --> 03:29:22,330
Chained together.

5204
03:29:22,970 --> 03:29:23,770
Oh god.

5205
03:29:25,590 --> 03:29:27,390
Have you played with someone yet, by now?

5206
03:29:27,590 --> 03:29:27,870
No.

5207
03:29:28,810 --> 03:29:29,750
Still not?

5208
03:29:29,930 --> 03:29:30,250
No.

5209
03:29:30,990 --> 03:29:32,750
I'm also still a chained virgin.

5210
03:29:37,730 --> 03:29:41,550
We can lose that together.

5211
03:29:42,830 --> 03:29:44,010
Maybe we should.

5212
03:29:44,010 --> 03:29:45,030
Maybe we should.

5213
03:29:45,810 --> 03:29:49,110
But you know what would be a requirement?

5214
03:29:49,710 --> 03:29:49,930
What?

5215
03:29:51,270 --> 03:29:55,030
Fan art of us naked chained together.

5216
03:30:01,040 --> 03:30:03,520
Wait, have you played the Sisyphus game?

5217
03:30:06,240 --> 03:30:08,880
The one with the big stone ball?

5218
03:30:09,060 --> 03:30:11,960
Yeah, okay, so play that, and then we can play chained together.

5219
03:30:12,560 --> 03:30:13,020
Why?

5220
03:30:13,560 --> 03:30:13,940
Why?

5221
03:30:14,200 --> 03:30:15,100
Why is that a requirement?

5222
03:30:15,340 --> 03:30:17,000
Why do I need to be tortured?

5223
03:30:17,940 --> 03:30:20,000
Because we're gonna then be tortured together.

5224
03:30:20,320 --> 03:30:24,660
And we'll be on the same level, you know, of our mental state.

5225
03:30:28,680 --> 03:30:32,880
If anything, I should have played it when it was the flavor of the month in holo.

5226
03:30:34,640 --> 03:30:35,660
It's too late.

5227
03:30:35,880 --> 03:30:37,020
No, don't play it.

5228
03:30:37,600 --> 03:30:38,240
Don't do it.

5229
03:30:39,040 --> 03:30:39,540
It's okay.

5230
03:30:39,540 --> 03:30:41,180
My pumpnails are drawing themselves.

5231
03:30:42,220 --> 03:30:44,180
It's like I'm using cheat codes.

5232
03:30:46,080 --> 03:30:48,140
What would the cheat code be?

5233
03:30:48,320 --> 03:30:49,160
What would the name be?

5234
03:30:51,920 --> 03:30:53,400
What's our couple name?

5235
03:30:54,860 --> 03:30:57,500
I see people say Mintory, but...

5236
03:30:57,500 --> 03:30:57,940
Mintory?

5237
03:30:58,360 --> 03:31:00,700
Mintory Spicy Time is the cheat code.

5238
03:31:02,740 --> 03:31:04,140
Mintory Spicy Time.

5239
03:31:06,360 --> 03:31:10,880
Yeah, I wanna play more with you in any game we'll do, you know?

5240
03:31:11,120 --> 03:31:11,780
Yeah, okay.

5241
03:31:12,740 --> 03:31:15,380
It's so nice to be with you.

5242
03:31:15,920 --> 03:31:17,100
I know, I like playing with you.

5243
03:31:23,520 --> 03:31:25,040
Guys, those were for me only.

5244
03:31:25,240 --> 03:31:26,420
No one self-insert.

5245
03:31:27,220 --> 03:31:28,140
Yeah, they're for you.

5246
03:31:31,500 --> 03:31:36,460
Normally, only my cats get these kisses and red superchats, but that's different.

5247
03:31:36,640 --> 03:31:36,840
What?

5248
03:31:37,320 --> 03:31:39,540
How are you giving your cats red superchats?

5249
03:31:40,020 --> 03:31:40,420
No, no, no.

5250
03:31:41,220 --> 03:31:44,200
When I get red superchats, I'm like, thank you for the red superchats.

5251
03:31:48,200 --> 03:31:50,380
KFP getting real fan service.

5252
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:55,880
Yeah, I started doing that like a long time ago and I was like super embarrassed about it in the beginning.

5253
03:31:59,460 --> 03:32:01,380
But nowadays it's just so normal.

5254
03:32:03,260 --> 03:32:03,780
Chicken.

5255
03:32:05,000 --> 03:32:05,520
Chicken?

5256
03:32:06,300 --> 03:32:06,640
Yeah.

5257
03:32:07,600 --> 03:32:08,320
I'm gonna eat you.

5258
03:32:08,400 --> 03:32:08,800
Chicken for dinner.

5259
03:32:09,020 --> 03:32:09,280
Yeah.

5260
03:32:09,520 --> 03:32:10,480
Why not chicken dinner?

5261
03:32:10,740 --> 03:32:12,020
We are the winners!

5262
03:32:13,180 --> 03:32:14,900
We are the winners!

5263
03:32:16,740 --> 03:32:21,840
One day we'll get a legitimate no cheat win, but today is not one of those days.

5264
03:32:21,840 --> 03:32:27,600
I still think though it was still valuable to see how the AI works.

5265
03:32:28,220 --> 03:32:35,300
Yes, and from my POV, it was funny every time you zoomed in with the cars to get the relic thing down.

5266
03:32:39,280 --> 03:32:41,040
We had to do it, we had to do it.

5267
03:32:41,080 --> 03:32:43,440
For the sake of our enjoyment too.

5268
03:32:44,800 --> 03:32:45,940
And we didn't overdo it.

5269
03:32:46,160 --> 03:32:49,600
We could have totally like raided him with those cars completely.

5270
03:32:49,600 --> 03:32:50,560
I know, right?

5271
03:32:50,700 --> 03:32:52,080
I stayed outside.

5272
03:32:52,220 --> 03:32:56,020
In fact, when they started attacking the other buildings, I was like no, no, no, let's go.

5273
03:32:59,500 --> 03:33:02,360
Well, I'll practice a bit more so I can carry you better.

5274
03:33:02,840 --> 03:33:02,920
Okay.

5275
03:33:03,700 --> 03:33:05,400
Carry me, princess carry me.

5276
03:33:05,900 --> 03:33:13,080
No, you gotta play more too, because that was like literally the only stream in the longest time ever that I kind of like...

5277
03:33:13,080 --> 03:33:16,440
And like just was able to chill while watching.

5278
03:33:17,540 --> 03:33:23,640
So please play more Age of Empires, especially because you don't have to wait like a whole week to get perms each time.

5279
03:33:23,720 --> 03:33:24,760
Oh, true.

5280
03:33:25,080 --> 03:33:26,100
Can you play like tomorrow?

5281
03:33:26,540 --> 03:33:29,440
I could play, I already have my schedule, but I mean...

5282
03:33:30,500 --> 03:33:31,280
Fuck it!

5283
03:33:35,360 --> 03:33:37,800
What are you doing for Valentine's Day?

5284
03:33:37,860 --> 03:33:42,440
Are you perhaps turning the dress around so that it's on your backside or...

5285
03:33:43,960 --> 03:33:45,900
No, I have some other things to show off.

5286
03:33:47,160 --> 03:33:47,680
Mmm...

5287
03:33:50,200 --> 03:33:54,600
Well, well, well...

5288
03:33:54,600 --> 03:33:55,460
You know what you should do?

5289
03:33:56,100 --> 03:33:56,360
What?

5290
03:33:57,280 --> 03:33:58,440
You should do a...

5291
03:34:01,600 --> 03:34:02,640
Mint chocolate...

5292
03:34:03,680 --> 03:34:05,220
Making hand cam stream.

5293
03:34:06,480 --> 03:34:06,780
Oh.

5294
03:34:07,700 --> 03:34:14,760
Why didn't you... Why didn't you suggest... I already have... Well, I'm still in the process of making everything, but...

5295
03:34:15,440 --> 03:34:18,860
Why did I not suggest you a Valentine's Day stream idea earlier?

5296
03:34:19,500 --> 03:34:20,200
Yeah, why didn't you give me context now?

5297
03:34:20,200 --> 03:34:21,620
I didn't know you were struggling.

5298
03:34:22,320 --> 03:34:24,080
I didn't know you didn't have an idea.

5299
03:34:24,220 --> 03:34:27,180
You seem like, you know, you come up with ideas quite easily on your own.

5300
03:34:27,400 --> 03:34:27,980
Yeah, I haven't.

5301
03:34:28,040 --> 03:34:36,020
Well, I actually had an idea and I had to scrap it this week, like two days ago, so I quickly scrambled to come up with another idea.

5302
03:34:36,360 --> 03:34:37,780
So I've been making that.

5303
03:34:38,680 --> 03:34:40,180
Oh, I'm curious.

5304
03:34:40,840 --> 03:34:41,840
I'm looking forward to it.

5305
03:34:42,620 --> 03:34:44,920
Whatever you do, but also play AoE, please.

5306
03:34:45,100 --> 03:34:45,320
Okay.

5307
03:34:46,100 --> 03:34:48,120
I can also off-stream, you know.

5308
03:34:49,340 --> 03:34:50,880
Oh, no, I don't care for that.

5309
03:34:51,060 --> 03:34:51,840
Oh, never mind.

5310
03:34:52,400 --> 03:34:54,100
I will never touch it again off-stream.

5311
03:34:54,840 --> 03:34:58,940
No, it's gonna be... It's gonna be a proper stream, because I don't... You wouldn't even, like...

5312
03:34:59,420 --> 03:35:00,620
Oh, you mean... Oh, you would practice.

5313
03:35:00,700 --> 03:35:03,580
I thought you meant you would stream privately to me on Discord.

5314
03:35:03,820 --> 03:35:05,760
Oh, do you want me to do that?

5315
03:35:06,280 --> 03:35:08,200
No, no, no, no, no, this is not the same.

5316
03:35:08,780 --> 03:35:09,520
It's different.

5317
03:35:10,100 --> 03:35:10,320
Okay.

5318
03:35:10,320 --> 03:35:13,720
But yeah, you could play off-stream if you wanna.

5319
03:35:13,960 --> 03:35:14,760
If you feel it.

5320
03:35:14,840 --> 03:35:15,580
If you're feeling it.

5321
03:35:15,620 --> 03:35:16,600
I did a couple times.

5322
03:35:19,480 --> 03:35:23,880
I just feel like, if I'm gonna, like, play a game, I'm gonna stream it.

5323
03:35:23,940 --> 03:35:28,980
But today, I was practicing before the stream, but, you know, normally...

5324
03:35:28,980 --> 03:35:29,840
I know, you're so diligent.

5325
03:35:31,420 --> 03:35:32,020
Just a little.

5326
03:35:32,160 --> 03:35:36,580
I didn't wanna, you know, be absolutely clueless when playing with you.

5327
03:35:37,360 --> 03:35:39,140
Are you... Okay, wait.

5328
03:35:39,340 --> 03:35:40,500
Who trained you before?

5329
03:35:42,020 --> 03:35:48,800
It's somebody who is, like, a caster for, like, professional Age of Empire matches.

5330
03:35:49,260 --> 03:35:56,100
She, like... Before she focused on casting, she was more of a, like, focused professional player herself.

5331
03:35:56,240 --> 03:35:56,960
Her name is Ellie.

5332
03:35:57,700 --> 03:35:58,340
Ellie4k.

5333
03:35:59,400 --> 03:36:06,360
I looked for all of the AoE players that I could find, and I, like, found this cute chick, and I even met her in person.

5334
03:36:07,240 --> 03:36:07,600
What?

5335
03:36:07,600 --> 03:36:08,360
Oh my god.

5336
03:36:10,120 --> 03:36:11,720
Ellie4k, don't watch this stream, okay?

5337
03:36:11,740 --> 03:36:12,760
She would be so disappointed.

5338
03:36:13,560 --> 03:36:15,200
I don't know if she's still active, actually.

5339
03:36:15,300 --> 03:36:18,660
We haven't talked in a long time, and I don't know what she's up to right now.

5340
03:36:19,400 --> 03:36:26,740
But she's really sweet, and she teaches really well, but then she always makes an alarm when I have an idle villager.

5341
03:36:26,840 --> 03:36:29,200
She's like, we will, we won't, we won't, we won't, we won't.

5342
03:36:29,260 --> 03:36:30,140
And I'm like, aah!

5343
03:36:32,420 --> 03:36:33,960
She was, like, hardcore.

5344
03:36:34,400 --> 03:36:35,600
It's like a boot camp.

5345
03:36:35,920 --> 03:36:36,460
Yeah, yeah.

5346
03:36:36,540 --> 03:36:38,660
It sounds pretty intense.

5347
03:36:39,940 --> 03:36:40,920
I should have done that.

5348
03:36:40,980 --> 03:36:42,440
We will, we will, we... Actually, yeah.

5349
03:36:42,600 --> 03:36:42,940
No!

5350
03:36:44,120 --> 03:36:45,120
Don't you dare.

5351
03:36:45,260 --> 03:36:46,620
I can't hear it anymore.

5352
03:36:48,240 --> 03:36:49,800
Recently, she's still streaming?

5353
03:36:49,960 --> 03:36:52,440
Okay, but I think probably not, like, every day, right?

5354
03:36:52,800 --> 03:36:53,300
But, yeah.

5355
03:36:54,520 --> 03:36:55,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5356
03:36:57,060 --> 03:36:58,940
Okay, we're gonna become professionals.

5357
03:37:02,740 --> 03:37:03,560
You and me.

5358
03:37:04,080 --> 03:37:04,520
Not by ourselves.

5359
03:37:04,520 --> 03:37:08,660
That's the dream I had a year ago, and, I mean, you know...

5360
03:37:10,460 --> 03:37:15,160
I feel like I would play it more often, more consistently, if I didn't have to ask what params each freaking time.

5361
03:37:15,160 --> 03:37:15,820
Oh, yeah.

5362
03:37:16,260 --> 03:37:17,280
No, I get that.

5363
03:37:17,880 --> 03:37:21,020
Because having to plan so far in advance is a bit rough.

5364
03:37:23,140 --> 03:37:27,780
I know, we actually... I will schedule a stream for next week, I think I will.

5365
03:37:28,440 --> 03:37:31,100
Oh my gosh, everybody excited for more.

5366
03:37:31,800 --> 03:37:34,440
Whether you join me or not is your choice.

5367
03:37:35,500 --> 03:37:39,700
But maybe it's good to, like, learn a bit more alone again before we do another collab.

5368
03:37:40,280 --> 03:37:40,560
Yeah.

5369
03:37:40,680 --> 03:37:41,280
On this game.

5370
03:37:42,400 --> 03:37:42,960
Yeah.

5371
03:37:43,240 --> 03:37:44,540
Get our individual skills up.

5372
03:37:44,960 --> 03:37:46,460
I still wanna play with Chat, too.

5373
03:37:47,180 --> 03:37:48,920
Even though they'll obliterate me.

5374
03:37:50,460 --> 03:37:51,860
Be easy on her, Chat.

5375
03:37:52,020 --> 03:37:53,820
Otherwise, what's there to learn?

5376
03:37:53,940 --> 03:37:56,480
Like, give her... Don't kill her immediately.

5377
03:37:57,560 --> 03:37:59,420
Give her some time to build up.

5378
03:38:01,320 --> 03:38:02,980
What are they saying?

5379
03:38:04,360 --> 03:38:06,200
They're saying... No mercy.

5380
03:38:06,800 --> 03:38:07,280
No!

5381
03:38:09,840 --> 03:38:12,000
Maybe you should play with my Chat.

5382
03:38:14,340 --> 03:38:16,400
Yeah, KFP, will you be nice to me?

5383
03:38:16,840 --> 03:38:18,040
I think they will.

5384
03:38:18,280 --> 03:38:19,580
They will, they will.

5385
03:38:19,960 --> 03:38:22,860
They learn from me to, like, have restraint.

5386
03:38:25,500 --> 03:38:28,780
I taught them to be nice in these situations.

5387
03:38:29,120 --> 03:38:30,680
I'll turn on cheats only for me.

5388
03:38:31,600 --> 03:38:33,740
If they get too out of line, they get the car.

5389
03:38:37,540 --> 03:38:38,020
Yeah.

5390
03:38:38,980 --> 03:38:40,020
Come on, Chat.

5391
03:38:40,480 --> 03:38:42,740
You gotta be nice, especially to guests.

5392
03:38:44,020 --> 03:38:44,780
Wait, are they not...

5393
03:38:44,780 --> 03:38:45,860
You gotta make a good impression.

5394
03:38:46,000 --> 03:38:47,440
KFP, are you not being very kind?

5395
03:38:48,720 --> 03:38:52,920
Okay, somebody said some mercy, but a lot of them say no mercy.

5396
03:38:53,640 --> 03:38:55,980
But they'll give you mercy, right?

5397
03:38:57,040 --> 03:38:58,600
I didn't ask about that.

5398
03:38:58,660 --> 03:39:00,380
Would you guys give me mercy?

5399
03:39:00,620 --> 03:39:01,280
Yes, you would.

5400
03:39:01,300 --> 03:39:04,780
They might say no mercy, but they don't mean it.

5401
03:39:07,220 --> 03:39:10,020
Oh, they're putting the polite emotes.

5402
03:39:10,640 --> 03:39:11,580
They're so polite.

5403
03:39:12,660 --> 03:39:14,100
They're so considerate.

5404
03:39:14,260 --> 03:39:14,740
Only Wawa.

5405
03:39:14,840 --> 03:39:15,680
Oh, yes?

5406
03:39:17,260 --> 03:39:19,400
Oh, some of them are saying yeah?

5407
03:39:21,620 --> 03:39:23,120
I'm so flattered.

5408
03:39:23,480 --> 03:39:25,040
What's wrong with you guys?

5409
03:39:25,920 --> 03:39:28,100
Hey, Wisps, what's wrong with you?

5410
03:39:28,460 --> 03:39:29,800
Yeah, Wisps, come on.

5411
03:39:29,820 --> 03:39:32,080
At least 50% of you guys gotta say yes.

5412
03:39:32,220 --> 03:39:33,820
We'll be merciful.

5413
03:39:36,980 --> 03:39:38,880
No, but they also don't mean it.

5414
03:39:38,980 --> 03:39:39,640
They're tsundere.

5415
03:39:40,720 --> 03:39:42,700
No, they mean it.

5416
03:39:45,880 --> 03:39:47,920
Because you're so teasable.

5417
03:39:48,960 --> 03:39:49,400
No!

5418
03:39:50,680 --> 03:39:53,360
It's that Toy Story meme.

5419
03:39:53,660 --> 03:39:56,580
I'm dropping the idea of playing with them now.

5420
03:39:56,700 --> 03:39:58,480
I don't wanna play with you anymore.

5421
03:40:00,100 --> 03:40:01,140
There it goes.

5422
03:40:01,240 --> 03:40:03,980
Your chance to play AoE with her.

5423
03:40:03,980 --> 03:40:06,040
That's how easy it is.

5424
03:40:06,960 --> 03:40:07,520
Gone.

5425
03:40:08,040 --> 03:40:08,580
It's gone.

5426
03:40:10,180 --> 03:40:15,400
You should've said yes just to lead her on and then obliterate her.

5427
03:40:17,060 --> 03:40:18,180
That's worse.

5428
03:40:18,360 --> 03:40:19,660
That's a betrayal.

5429
03:40:21,880 --> 03:40:24,680
But then at least they would've gotten to play with you.

5430
03:40:25,200 --> 03:40:26,060
Oh, that's true.

5431
03:40:27,640 --> 03:40:29,300
I'm telling you the strats, chat.

5432
03:40:29,440 --> 03:40:30,140
I'm telling you.

5433
03:40:30,360 --> 03:40:31,280
Lead her on.

5434
03:40:31,680 --> 03:40:32,020
No!

5435
03:40:33,660 --> 03:40:35,400
Don't lead me on!

5436
03:40:37,060 --> 03:40:40,380
Discord cut you out when you're getting squeaky.

5437
03:40:40,600 --> 03:40:41,000
Sorry.

5438
03:40:41,500 --> 03:40:42,720
Don't lead me on!

5439
03:40:46,540 --> 03:40:47,920
Can I lead you on?

5440
03:40:49,500 --> 03:40:51,460
You can lead me anywhere, baby.

5441
03:40:58,100 --> 03:41:00,520
Alright, I'm gonna go cook dinner now.

5442
03:41:00,660 --> 03:41:01,300
What are you gonna do?

5443
03:41:02,020 --> 03:41:06,180
I'm also gonna go... Actually, I'm gonna work on my Valentine's livestream.

5444
03:41:09,900 --> 03:41:13,320
I have to work on some stuff too tomorrow.

5445
03:41:15,820 --> 03:41:16,720
Stay to play.

5446
03:41:19,080 --> 03:41:20,280
Oh yeah, stay to play!

5447
03:41:20,880 --> 03:41:24,860
I saw the announcement and I saw it was apparently pretty long too.

5448
03:41:24,920 --> 03:41:27,580
And I was wondering, maybe I'll squeeze a watch along.

5449
03:41:27,700 --> 03:41:28,080
Long?

5450
03:41:28,420 --> 03:41:30,300
It's usually like an hour, 45 minutes, right?

5451
03:41:31,300 --> 03:41:31,640
Yeah.

5452
03:41:32,800 --> 03:41:36,520
Yeah, so it's like... Maybe good?

5453
03:41:36,880 --> 03:41:37,780
What could there be?

5454
03:41:38,000 --> 03:41:39,040
What could they announce?

5455
03:41:39,800 --> 03:41:41,820
You think so?

5456
03:41:42,000 --> 03:41:42,700
Is that realistic?

5457
03:41:49,920 --> 03:41:53,780
It's not just your innocent heart?

5458
03:41:53,880 --> 03:41:57,220
No, I think it's really actually...

5459
03:41:57,220 --> 03:41:58,960
People are wanting the old Bloodborne too.

5460
03:42:01,640 --> 03:42:03,960
That seems unrealistic apparently.

5461
03:42:04,100 --> 03:42:04,880
That's copium.

5462
03:42:05,000 --> 03:42:07,800
That's been copium for like the past however long.

5463
03:42:09,040 --> 03:42:11,180
Ah, Death Stranding 2 news.

5464
03:42:11,360 --> 03:42:12,520
Yeah, maybe some updates.

5465
03:42:13,280 --> 03:42:15,260
Have you played Death Stranding before?

5466
03:42:15,680 --> 03:42:16,200
I have.

5467
03:42:16,380 --> 03:42:17,960
I didn't finish it, but I have played it.

5468
03:42:18,900 --> 03:42:24,640
I was also... I watched Pekora's full playthrough of it years ago.

5469
03:42:25,180 --> 03:42:27,060
Before I joined Holo.

5470
03:42:27,640 --> 03:42:32,680
It was like my corona therapy.

5471
03:42:35,140 --> 03:42:36,740
So now, I don't know.

5472
03:42:36,820 --> 03:42:39,420
Something about it, I just want to play it.

5473
03:42:39,480 --> 03:42:41,680
So I might play it sometime in 2025.

5474
03:42:42,260 --> 03:42:42,900
You should.

5475
03:42:43,120 --> 03:42:44,520
It's really...

5476
03:42:44,520 --> 03:42:47,660
Well, there's like stressful parts, but part of it's so relaxing too.

5477
03:42:47,880 --> 03:42:49,760
There's just something so nice about this game.

5478
03:42:49,880 --> 03:42:50,700
Walking, yeah.

5479
03:42:51,340 --> 03:42:52,520
Yeah, hell yeah.

5480
03:42:53,200 --> 03:42:56,500
But there's a lot of copyrighted songs in it, so...

5481
03:42:56,500 --> 03:42:57,600
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

5482
03:42:57,660 --> 03:42:58,200
Be careful.

5483
03:42:58,360 --> 03:42:59,840
I'll figure it out.

5484
03:43:02,360 --> 03:43:04,560
Okay, so that's where we're at.

5485
03:43:04,740 --> 03:43:06,640
Thank you for playing with me.

5486
03:43:06,720 --> 03:43:08,340
Thank you for playing with me.

5487
03:43:08,660 --> 03:43:09,900
We'll play again soon.

5488
03:43:10,900 --> 03:43:11,320
Okay.

5489
03:43:11,940 --> 03:43:12,160
Something.

5490
03:43:12,560 --> 03:43:12,840
Whatever.

5491
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:14,340
It doesn't have to be this, but anything.

5492
03:43:16,580 --> 03:43:17,140
Okay.

5493
03:43:17,440 --> 03:43:19,620
Have a good day, milady.

5494
03:43:20,200 --> 03:43:22,480
You have delicious dinner.

5495
03:43:23,200 --> 03:43:23,840
Send me picture.

5496
03:43:24,860 --> 03:43:25,900
Oh, okay.

5497
03:43:26,820 --> 03:43:28,860
Your cooking is so good.

5498
03:43:29,780 --> 03:43:30,860
Oh, thank you.

5499
03:43:30,940 --> 03:43:31,840
You haven't tried it yet.

5500
03:43:31,920 --> 03:43:34,080
Maybe it's just the visuals that are good, not the...

5501
03:43:34,080 --> 03:43:35,560
Not the taste, but...

5502
03:43:35,560 --> 03:43:38,520
I hope the taste is good, so you're eating good food.

5503
03:43:39,380 --> 03:43:40,340
It depends.

5504
03:43:40,540 --> 03:43:42,760
Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's mid, but...

5505
03:43:42,760 --> 03:43:44,880
I will cook the best thing for you.

5506
03:43:45,100 --> 03:43:46,440
If you ever come here.

5507
03:43:47,860 --> 03:43:49,180
Come to Wawa Town.

5508
03:43:50,340 --> 03:43:52,140
Come to Flavor Town.

5509
03:43:53,420 --> 03:43:55,180
KFP Flavor Town!

5510
03:43:56,040 --> 03:43:57,700
Let's go to Flavor Town!

5511
03:43:58,400 --> 03:44:00,280
I'm going to Flavor Town now.

5512
03:44:00,400 --> 03:44:02,380
In German you say Auf Wiedersehen.

5513
03:44:02,460 --> 03:44:03,720
How do you say goodbye in German?

5514
03:44:06,960 --> 03:44:08,320
The LARPer.

5515
03:44:09,020 --> 03:44:10,380
I'm not LARPer!

5516
03:44:12,920 --> 03:44:14,540
Okay, Auf Wiedersehen, Minto.

5517
03:44:16,100 --> 03:44:17,460
Auf Wiedersehen.

5518
03:44:18,320 --> 03:44:19,320
So cute.

5519
03:44:21,900 --> 03:44:22,900
Thank you!

5520
03:44:24,180 --> 03:44:24,680
Goodbye!

5521
03:44:25,940 --> 03:44:28,100
Wait, are you going to talk to each other?

5522
03:44:29,040 --> 03:44:30,080
No, are you?

5523
03:44:30,480 --> 03:44:31,840
I was just going to say bye to them.

5524
03:44:35,260 --> 03:44:36,600
Okay, I'll say one thing.

5525
03:44:36,660 --> 03:44:37,960
I'll give them one small tangent.

5526
03:44:38,340 --> 03:44:38,540
Okay.

5527
03:44:40,040 --> 03:44:44,500
Are we going to see each other again?

5528
03:44:45,180 --> 03:44:46,000
After this?

5529
03:44:46,800 --> 03:44:48,640
Do you want to?

5530
03:44:49,020 --> 03:44:50,440
No, we don't have to.

5531
03:44:50,640 --> 03:44:52,100
I mean...

5532
03:44:52,100 --> 03:44:54,240
We could!

5533
03:44:57,020 --> 03:44:58,300
Wait for me!

5534
03:44:58,900 --> 03:44:59,640
Okay, I'll wait for you.

5535
03:45:00,440 --> 03:45:00,900
Bye bye!

5536
03:45:04,430 --> 03:45:06,650
Okay, we just muted each other.

5537
03:45:08,450 --> 03:45:12,110
Anyways guys, thank you for...

5538
03:45:12,110 --> 03:45:18,030
Oh my gosh, I didn't expect the hard to be so hard.

5539
03:45:18,030 --> 03:45:19,670
That guy was crazy!

5540
03:45:19,850 --> 03:45:20,870
That guy was...

5541
03:45:21,530 --> 03:45:23,830
He kept attacking me every two seconds!

5542
03:45:24,050 --> 03:45:28,810
I feel bad that I kind of just got lost in the sauce after the initial attack.

5543
03:45:28,930 --> 03:45:34,210
And then it was hard for me to feel like I could get back on my feet.

5544
03:45:35,450 --> 03:45:37,850
But he kept killing all my people!

5545
03:45:39,010 --> 03:45:40,470
It's so crazy!

5546
03:45:40,910 --> 03:45:41,910
Steal his strats.

5547
03:45:41,990 --> 03:45:42,650
I know!

5548
03:45:43,750 --> 03:45:44,750
Holy moly!

5549
03:45:44,850 --> 03:45:46,650
And it gets even more difficult!

5550
03:45:46,650 --> 03:45:54,050
Thank you guys for all the donos and all the superchats!

5551
03:45:54,550 --> 03:45:55,570
You two are always so cute together.

5552
03:45:59,390 --> 03:46:01,470
I have to pee so bad.

5553
03:46:01,610 --> 03:46:04,070
So I'm going to say goodbye to you guys tomorrow.

5554
03:46:04,530 --> 03:46:06,510
I'm not streaming, but I will be doing...

5555
03:46:06,510 --> 03:46:07,570
Well, I am streaming now.

5556
03:46:07,770 --> 03:46:08,910
I was not supposed to be streaming.

5557
03:46:09,250 --> 03:46:10,710
Rather, is what I should have said.

5558
03:46:10,970 --> 03:46:12,970
But I will be doing a State of Play watch along.

5559
03:46:13,070 --> 03:46:14,910
Because I must know about Metal Gear.

5560
03:46:14,910 --> 03:46:18,310
Or anything else.

5561
03:46:18,770 --> 03:46:20,550
I'm excited to see.

5562
03:46:21,870 --> 03:46:22,870
Anyway!

5563
03:46:26,170 --> 03:46:29,270
Thank you guys!

5564
03:46:31,910 --> 03:46:33,490
Bye bye!

5565
03:46:34,490 --> 03:46:34,970
Thank you!
