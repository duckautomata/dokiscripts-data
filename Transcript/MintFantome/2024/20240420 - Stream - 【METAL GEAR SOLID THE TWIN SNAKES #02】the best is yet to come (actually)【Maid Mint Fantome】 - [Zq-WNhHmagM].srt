1
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,240
I don't think we watched this before.

2
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,580
I think we only watched the briefings.

3
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,100
I don't think this is the same as...

4
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,580
No, it isn't, right?

5
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,950
That's where snakes don't belong.

6
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,250
How's the audio, by the way, guys?

7
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,610
Let me know.

8
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:52,710
It's always confusing for me because the El Gato says something different than what my mixer says.

9
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,590
It's good?

10
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,150
Look at that guy.

11
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,490
Wow.

12
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,330
Audio good?

13
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,090
Who's that?

14
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,110
It doesn't matter who he is.

15
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,510
Roy Campbell says you don't matter.

16
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,350
I'm in charge of this here mission.

17
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,490
Also, I just realized he has the Fox Town logo on his...

18
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,890
Why does he have the Fox Town logo on his...

19
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,830
on his jacket?

20
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:47,750
Naomi.

21
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,770
Naomi Hunter.

22
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,070
I wonder what Hunter is in German.

23
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,930
It's his old jacket.

24
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,950
Yeah, I know he was Fox Town.

25
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:08,450
You'd think, though, that, like, you wouldn't want to wear something that the terrorists wear, like, are associating themselves with.

26
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,130
You know what I mean?

27
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,090
You'd think that you'd want to be like, hmm, I'm not with them.

28
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,490
Hahaha.

29
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,170
Hahaha.

30
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,830
Wow.

31
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,470
Oh my god, his speed.

32
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,270
Yeah.

33
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,870
Oh, get rid of it.

34
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,050
That's so wasteful.

35
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,690
Sorry, I know it probably feels like we just, like, jumped right into it.

36
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,630
This is just playing the intro, you know?

37
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,070
A little... a little...

38
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,330
refresher, right?

39
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,730
The sushi!

40
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,450
The sushi!

41
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,330
The beautiful and deadly sharpshooter.

42
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,550
The beautiful and deadly sharpshooter.

43
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,250
Decoy octopus.

44
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,850
Master of disguise.

45
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,370
Thanks, sushi.

46
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,710
For the toy to get.

47
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,290
And revolver ocelot.

48
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:07,970
Shaman.

49
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,890
You pronounce it wrong.

50
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,590
Colonel?

51
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,190
Giant and Shaman.

52
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,690
Foxhound's blob leader.

53
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,610
Liquid snake.

54
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,590
Liquid snake.

55
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,830
Giant and Shaman.

56
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,950
Big pumpy welcome to membership.

57
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,770
Thank you!

58
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,610
Mint is in the bandana.

59
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:36,870
Mint is in the bandana.

60
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,470
Sheesh.

61
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,390
Were those always there?

62
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,030
I don't think so, right?

63
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,970
Maybe you should have abandoned it, snake!

64
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,270
Maybe you should have gotten rid of it!

65
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,670
Oh, this is why we're messed up in the mission.

66
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,190
Because we're messed up in the head!

67
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,350
From all the clunks!

68
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,550
We have a concussion!

69
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,230
He covers the whole island.

70
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,190
I'll instruct you by codec after you reach your target.

71
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,350
Anyone going with me?

72
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,590
As always, this is a one-man sneaking mission.

73
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,370
Oh, yeah.

74
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,210
Weapons and equipment OSP.

75
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,730
Yes.

76
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,450
This is a top secret black op.

77
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,750
Don't expect any official support.

78
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,910
I brought my controller.

79
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,850
I'm so clumsy.

80
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,070
Wow!

81
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:26,870
Oh.

82
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,550
Welcome back, master, princess!

83
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,710
Welcome back to Metal Gear Solid!

84
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,290
The twins!

85
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,450
Snakes!

86
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,910
Yippee!

87
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,310
Welcome back!

88
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:50,690
Welcome back!

89
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,890
I'm so glad you're back.

90
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,910
No worries!

91
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:07,230
I'm glad that I could do a little bit to help with whatever you were going through.

92
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,070
Bells a hurry.

93
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,170
And hopefully you enjoy these playthroughs.

94
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,690
Also, talk strength!

95
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,350
Thank you for the pink!

96
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,870
This got moved to Friday.

97
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,890
I told my manager I could not come into the office.

98
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,470
No!

99
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,030
What do you mean?

100
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:22,930
Don't!

101
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,390
No!

102
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,570
Oh my gosh, please.

103
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,710
Don't skip work because there's a VOD, you know?

104
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,490
Thank you so much for the ten gifted!

105
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,590
Thank you for the five!

106
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,770
Johnny, thank you for the five!

107
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,510
This is getting out of hand.

108
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,010
Now there's two.

109
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,090
Welcome to membership!

110
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,950
Thank you guys!

111
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,530
Last time we left off with Meryl getting a little pew-pewed.

112
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,270
She's kind of on the ground.

113
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,870
She's kind of bleeding out.

114
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,170
We kind of got to go get a PSG to save her.

115
00:08:59,270 --> 00:08:59,670
But...

116
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,230
I...

117
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,690
I'm going to turn down the music just a little bit.

118
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,550
I plan on not saving her.

119
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,170
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,750
We are going to be doing the Otacon ending.

121
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,150
So, um...

122
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,070
I think when I play... when I replay the game though...

123
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,650
I'll do the Meryl ending.

124
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,310
But for this one specifically...

125
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,330
There's something that I want to see.

126
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,450
With the Otacon ending.

127
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,290
So we'll be doing that.

128
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,590
Of course!

129
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,270
Thank you for the five gifted!

130
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,690
Thank you for the five gifted!

131
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,610
Thank you for the five gifted!

132
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:33,890
Thank you guys.

133
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,810
The canon ending.

134
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,750
The best ending.

135
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,490
So sorry.

136
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,030
So sorry to Meryl.

137
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,790
To Meryl.

138
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,330
And I'm sorry again that I had to move this.

139
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,650
There was some stuff that came up.

140
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,910
Some things that I...

141
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,850
There was just...

142
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,490
It was a couple things.

143
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,510
Alvin, thank you for the five gifted.

144
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,010
Thank you.

145
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,230
But...

146
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,510
I didn't want to like...

147
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,390
Cancel it obviously.

148
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,690
And I was like...

149
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,410
What I was planning on doing on Friday got moved.

150
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,750
And so I was like...

151
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,610
I'll just shift a couple things around.

152
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,290
Baby.

153
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,630
Brick!

154
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,050
Oh my gosh.

155
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,530
Thank you for the...

156
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,270
Thank you so much.

157
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,670
Meryl?

158
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,070
Meryl, you see?

159
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,390
You heard nothing.

160
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,170
Meryl, you...

161
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,390
Heard nothing.

162
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:28,950
Oh shoot.

163
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,110
Okay.

164
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,430
It has to be this one.

165
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,070
It has to be this one.

166
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,290
Welcome to the membership.

167
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,730
Thank you for the gifted.

168
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,870
Thank you for the five gifted.

169
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,250
Meryl, you're bleeding.

170
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,190
Stop hearing stuff.

171
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,170
She's into...

172
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,810
She's in shock.

173
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:50,970
You know?

174
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,770
Maybe sepsis.

175
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,250
I don't know.

176
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,090
Productivity.

177
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,930
Good luck with work.

178
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,190
Thank you for the five gifted.

179
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:03,670
Thank you.

180
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,750
Meryl can become a membu too.

181
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,790
Right before...

182
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,750
You know what?

183
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,510
It's perfect though.

184
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,230
If she joins membership because...

185
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,590
Actually, I am going to move the notifs.

186
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,830
Because we'll move them like kind of over here.

187
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,830
So it's a little...

188
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,250
A little less invasive on the game.

189
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:23,970
Yeah, yeah.

190
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:24,450
Alright.

191
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,130
Oh, jeez.

192
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:27,390
Okay.

193
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,070
Guys, give me a second to...

194
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,990
To...

195
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,330
Oh, what is this?

196
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,730
Oh, there's a mission log.

197
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,370
I was just pressing yes.

198
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,370
To stop the terrorist's nuclear attack...

199
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,670
Snake must deactivate the detonation code...

200
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,710
Or destroy Metal Gear itself.

201
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,670
Snake and Meryl...

202
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,430
Head for the communications tower.

203
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,650
Communications tower...

204
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,670
The only way to the underground maintenance space.

205
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,630
Foxhound member Sniperwolf...

206
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,350
Fires at them.

207
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,090
And Meryl is badly wounded.

208
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,850
It is a trap to lure out Snake.

209
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,310
Snake must get up here...

210
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,730
Whoa!

211
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,210
Wait, that's Meryl in the back.

212
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,550
What?

213
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:12,870
I've never seen that before.

214
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,530
Oh my god.

215
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,890
Wait, that's so awesome.

216
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:16,850
Sorry.

217
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:17,570
Oh my gosh.

218
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:17,910
What?

219
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,470
That's so awesome.

220
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,150
What?

221
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,990
Oh my god.

222
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,010
Looks like Yoji, Shinkawa are too.

223
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:28,810
So...

224
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,830
That's so cool.

225
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,710
Oh my gosh.

226
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,870
Even when hurt, she's hot.

227
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,210
So true.

228
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,370
Meryl is dying.

229
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:40,890
Let's go.

230
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,790
This is the last time we'll see Meryl, actually.

231
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:46,970
Alive.

232
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,870
This is the last time we'll see Meryl alive.

233
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:55,990
Snake must get a PSG-1 to beat Wolf and save Meryl.

234
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,690
Oh my gosh.

235
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,830
It looks so good.

236
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,870
Okay, I have a question.

237
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,890
When I'm excited about some things like this, do I sound genuine?

238
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,110
Sometimes, like...

239
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:16,070
Sometimes when I'm talking, specifically to Matara, she'll tell me something and I'll be like, Oh my gosh!

240
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,590
That's cool!

241
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:19,670
That's cool!

242
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,470
She kind of makes fun of me.

243
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,290
She's like, you don't sound like you mean it at all.

244
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,170
And I'm like, I do!

245
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,330
And I'm like, I do!

246
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,130
And I'm like, I do!

247
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:34,430
And I'm like...

248
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,870
And I'm like...

249
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,950
I'm excited!

250
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,690
You sound like a freak affectionate.

251
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,170
You know what?

252
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,290
You are a freak, Raymac.

253
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,770
You are a freak!

254
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,530
How about that?

255
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,310
Anyway.

256
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,650
I am excited.

257
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,790
I think... I get very excited, especially seeing new Yoji Shinkawa art.

258
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,210
I recently got the...

259
00:13:59,310 --> 00:13:59,910
The...

260
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,590
The novel version of Peace Walker.

261
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,850
And it has so much art in it that I've never... Oh my gosh.

262
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,530
I was freaking... Oh my gosh.

263
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,890
There's this one beautiful picture of Strangelove like looking up at...

264
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,370
I don't know.

265
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,670
It's kind of hard to tell if it's Zeke or if it's like...

266
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,150
The Peace Walker.

267
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,570
I think it's the Peace Walker.

268
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,670
But you sound like a nerd so I believe it.

269
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,830
Stop liking that!

270
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,010
Stop liking... I can see...

271
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,990
Stop liking that super chat.

272
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,410
You're too much of a nerd not to be genuine about your excitement.

273
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:46,170
But yeah, there's this like gorgeous, gorgeous picture of her like looking up and I was like, I just need these blown up and like on a... like framed.

274
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:46,790
Oh my gosh.

275
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,530
I want them so bad.

276
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,290
Thank you for the summertime!

277
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:51,150
Thank you.

278
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:51,870
Okay.

279
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,810
Let's get going, baby.

280
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:56,650
Okay.

281
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,810
Let me also...

282
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:03,980
Um...

283
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,920
Okay, this is a good little area to remember how to do stuff, right?

284
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,740
Okay, so this is...

285
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,840
to fight.

286
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,960
B is to attack.

287
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,300
This is to crouch.

288
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,840
For those coming in and maybe didn't watch part one, um, this is my first time...

289
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,820
Well, I guess now.

290
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,640
This is my second time ever playing on a GameCube.

291
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,160
So I'm still... What is Y?

292
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,740
Is it nothing?

293
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,300
Oh no, that's the action button.

294
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,040
That's the action button.

295
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,200
If you were isekai to the MGS verse, who would you want to be reborn as?

296
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,220
Oh...

297
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,260
Maybe Sunny.

298
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,300
I feel like she has the least amount of trauma.

299
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,160
Also, it would be so cute to just make them eggs every morning.

300
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,900
And I can see...

301
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,880
I can see all the good Snake Otacon goodness, right?

302
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,160
Mei Ling...

303
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,760
Practice putting away your gut.

304
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,560
We're good.

305
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,300
We're good.

306
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,620
I think I got this.

307
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,580
I say.

308
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,560
Right now.

309
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,240
I say.

310
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,940
Okay, so we have to go back to the armory.

311
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,740
To all...

312
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,260
We have to go all the way back to the armory.

313
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,420
You know, it might be good to just, uh...

314
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,260
Probably, maybe...

315
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,300
Wait, teleport?

316
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,460
Oh!

317
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,140
Wait.

318
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,020
Oh!

319
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,720
No.

320
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,700
We have to go through the nuke building.

321
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,000
We're in the nuke building.

322
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,380
So if we go to the armory and then take this, then maybe we can go back.

323
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,600
There's a PSG on this floor in the remake.

324
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,300
Okay.

325
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,720
For what I understand, that PSG is a...

326
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,340
What's the word?

327
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,260
Is a, uh...

328
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,020
Tranquilizer version.

329
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,600
And...

330
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,960
Yeah, PSG-1T.

331
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,720
And honestly...

332
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,240
The tranq stuff...

333
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,260
Having, like...

334
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,300
Doing fights with the tranq...

335
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,100
Feels like it's, you know, like...

336
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,700
Even though it doesn't matter, it doesn't truly matter...

337
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,740
Like, you know, how am I supposed to do sniper wolf scene if I use the tranq PSG-1?

338
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,280
You know what I mean?

339
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,540
You are true VTuber and true patriot.

340
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,280
Mint boss.

341
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,520
Thanks, Ronin!

342
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,160
I don't know!

343
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,040
You enjoy all the killing.

344
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,620
Only in this game.

345
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,280
Because it makes sense, right?

346
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,300
It's not in the spirit of the original work.

347
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,680
Exactly!

348
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,080
So I feel like I have to go all the way back.

349
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,020
Even though I don't want to.

350
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,820
I don't want to, but I feel like I have to.

351
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,340
We're just gonna hide over here while we wait.

352
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,080
Oh, it's open.

353
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,780
That was fast.

354
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,200
And up to one.

355
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,080
They die from tranq overdose.

356
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:37,800
Maybe.

357
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,420
Oh my gosh.

358
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,780
This area is scary.

359
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,050
This area is so scary.

360
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,510
Recently, I have been feeling so sick.

361
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,450
And I was fine earlier.

362
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,430
Well, I was sick earlier, and then I felt fine, and now I'm starting to feel sick again.

363
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:04,970
Oh no.

364
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,750
I think I'll be okay though.

365
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,290
Maybe it's just nerves.

366
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,950
Maybe it's just me being a little baby.

367
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:14,930
Go!

368
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,190
Nice for you!

369
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,450
Nice for you!

370
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,190
Um...

371
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,650
Does he turn around?

372
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,510
This is our only chance.

373
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,510
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

374
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,410
She doesn't see me, right?

375
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,180
Okay.

376
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,780
This guy's gonna turn?

377
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,340
He doesn't come down though.

378
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,180
Oh, thank god.

379
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,380
Oh, she's We almost started out real crazy.

380
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:51,720
Okay.

381
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,300
Just a box!

382
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,640
Just a box!

383
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,230
I can't see where everybody is.

384
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,770
Where are you guys anyway?

385
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,050
I can't see at all.

386
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,330
I'm just gonna go.

387
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,410
I don't know if we can make it into the...

388
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,070
Why are your footsteps so loud, Snake?

389
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,190
There we go.

390
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:24,470
Oh.

391
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:24,950
Oh.

392
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,750
Oh.

393
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:28,610
Shit.

394
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,090
Oh, shit.

395
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,850
I think, um...

396
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,230
I think I'm doomed.

397
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,490
Um...

398
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,230
Just a box!

399
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,250
Just a box!

400
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,650
Just a box to the heliport!

401
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,650
To the heliport, please!

402
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:46,910
No!

403
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,250
I didn't... Oh, gosh.

404
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:51,870
Um...

405
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,010
Um...

406
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,280
Oh, I can't use...

407
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,860
You guys can't use weapons here either!

408
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,500
You guys can't use weapons here!

409
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,740
You guys can't use weapons here!

410
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,020
Can I have my box back?

411
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,060
Thank you.

412
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,780
Get out of here!

413
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,720
Oh, shoot.

414
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,140
That's why they have their little masks on.

415
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,660
This is messed up.

416
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,560
Come on, Snake!

417
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,940
Wait, why did that happen to you?

418
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,280
Crawl?

419
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,240
Crawl, crawl, crawl.

420
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:21,860
Here?

421
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,360
Okay.

422
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,640
Oh.

423
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,260
Uh...

424
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,240
Something over...

425
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,700
Oh, um...

426
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,580
My dad?

427
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,380
No way.

428
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,230
You can't do this!

429
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:35,990
Me!

430
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,370
Me!

431
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:36,630
Me!

432
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,590
If I get in here and I...

433
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,110
use the box...

434
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,130
Will it work?

435
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:42,610
I wonder.

436
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,940
To the heliport, please!

437
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,600
Okay.

438
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,440
Wow.

439
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,140
That was so...

440
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,240
Great start, everybody.

441
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,680
Great start.

442
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,240
That's okay.

443
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,420
That's so unfair that they can use...

444
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:12,920
weapons here.

445
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,780
No way.

446
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,060
That is so unfair.

447
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,020
I feel...

448
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,880
I feel like...

449
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,840
that they should also...

450
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,460
just, you know...

451
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,060
That is so unfair.

452
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,180
These guys...

453
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,340
These manomachines don't care if uranium leaks...

454
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,260
from shooting the nukes.

455
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,940
They just want to see the world burn.

456
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Their gas masks, I can guarantee you...

457
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,220
I picked up the same gas mask...

458
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,060
that they are wearing...

459
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,520
and it is not any better.

460
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,280
It is not any better than...

461
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,600
You know what?

462
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,260
I probably could knock this guy out.

463
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:50,920
But, whatever.

464
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,240
Get down to this.

465
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,400
Oh, oh.

466
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:58,860
Right here.

467
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,340
Right here.

468
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,600
Snake.

469
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,040
There you go.

470
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,100
Right there.

471
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,420
Okay.

472
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,080
It is not any better than what I'm using.

473
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,780
So, these guys should be down...

474
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,420
just as much as I am.

475
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,320
Ugh.

476
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,700
Maybe the mask doesn't fit right.

477
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,840
What are you saying?

478
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,560
I have a small face or a big face?

479
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,760
You know what?

480
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,560
I'm just going to leave.

481
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,760
I'm not even going to...

482
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,080
I'm not even going to...

483
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,340
take the special way.

484
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,100
We are just going to go the long way.

485
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,260
We are going to...

486
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,960
Let's go.

487
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:38,520
The door.

488
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,300
Okay.

489
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,840
Alrighty.

490
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,960
Is there anything over here?

491
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:48,660
Oh.

492
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,160
Do I need any rations?

493
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,960
Yes.

494
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,560
Nice.

495
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,620
Do I need also...

496
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,960
Mind detectors here.

497
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,560
I can't ever remember.

498
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,460
Oh.

499
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,700
It's just...

500
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:19,820
Wait.

501
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,480
There is actually people?

502
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,910
Wait.

503
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,390
There is people.

504
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:25,730
People?

505
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,990
Oh my god.

506
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,510
There is a person.

507
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,710
Since when?

508
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:30,490
Oh my god.

509
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,070
No.

510
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:31,910
No.

511
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:32,870
No, sir.

512
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,630
You seriously...

513
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,510
didn't see anything.

514
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,150
Where are you?

515
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:39,590
Oh.

516
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,530
Are you coming around this way?

517
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,470
Just your imagination, dummy.

518
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,810
Can I hit him through here?

519
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,550
Can I hit him through here?

520
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,070
That would be crazy.

521
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,830
You can't see me through the...

522
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,050
There we go.

523
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:01,750
Wow.

524
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,970
The cameras are kind of crazy out here.

525
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:05,930
Hello?

526
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,950
He didn't even notice my footsteps.

527
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,070
What?

528
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,070
This guy is totally new at the job.

529
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,510
How do I get around here?

530
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,230
Okay.

531
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,730
It's range is kind of insane.

532
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,770
You know what?

533
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:26,410
Maybe I should...

534
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,670
Why am I making life harder for myself?

535
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:30,990
Oh.

536
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,470
Who saw me?

537
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:31,950
Oh.

538
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,210
Someone saw me.

539
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:33,490
Oh.

540
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,790
There is people here.

541
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,130
Oh my god.

542
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,470
Wait.

543
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,190
Wait.

544
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,570
Ah.

545
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:44,630
Ah.

546
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,430
Warning shots.

547
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,670
Warning shots at you.

548
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,890
I can't see anything.

549
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,490
Where the hell are you?

550
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,350
Oh my god.

551
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,010
Oh my god.

552
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,650
Let's run.

553
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,410
Oh.

554
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,910
That's a person.

555
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,910
Ouch.

556
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,690
I tried attacking you and I don't know what happened.

557
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:03,750
Um.

558
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,390
Let me in.

559
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,670
Let me in.

560
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,320
Why is everything so bad today?

561
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,680
Um.

562
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,420
Ouch.

563
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:18,880
Hello?

564
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:19,560
Oh.

565
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,620
I keep pressing the wrong...

566
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,600
Leave me alone.

567
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,200
Oh.

568
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,000
This is a fight.

569
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:30,980
Oh.

570
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,200
Come on man.

571
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,800
CQC.

572
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,560
Something something.

573
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,840
Basics of CQC.

574
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,680
I thought I would be safe over here.

575
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,820
I thought there was nobody.

576
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,120
I didn't...

577
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,260
I should have just stuck right here.

578
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
I should have just stuck right here.

579
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,820
This sucks you guys.

580
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,520
Oh my god.

581
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,520
This sucks.

582
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,000
What a terrible area.

583
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,120
I thought there were only just cameras out here.

584
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,080
I have to worry about people now too?

585
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,340
I have to worry about people now too?

586
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,180
I have to worry about people now too?

587
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,780
This is the worst.

588
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,140
Oh shoot.

589
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,640
Don't make me go through this again.

590
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,780
Please.

591
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,320
God.

592
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,480
And I can't even hit.

593
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,280
Can't even aim.

594
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,430
Oh.

595
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:40,890
I'm

596
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,580
gonna investigate you.

597
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,400
Does this need to be a backup unit?

598
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:54,960
That's ridiculous.

599
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,880
Why would there need to be a backup unit?

600
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,140
Why would there need to be a...

601
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,700
Oh god.

602
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,640
Why

603
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,110
isn't it aiming?

604
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:15,670
Hello gun?

605
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,030
Oh there it is.

606
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,670
Cause I need to press a button.

607
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,350
Sir.

608
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,570
Just go down.

609
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,270
Oh my gosh.

610
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,930
Why am I going this way?

611
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,930
Should I just go back?

612
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,370
I think I should just...

613
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,550
I hit him right?

614
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:41,790
Maybe it's too far.

615
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,620
Don't kick him.

616
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,900
Looks all clear.

617
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:53,820
It does?

618
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,020
He just fell asleep twice.

619
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,920
Like a big old bozo.

620
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,000
The other way looks easier now.

621
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,680
It actually does.

622
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,460
Oh.

623
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,440
Okay come here.

624
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,480
Go back to sleep and we're gonna go back inside.

625
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,120
Oh shit.

626
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,760
Yep.

627
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,260
Okay.

628
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,910
What a waste of my time.

629
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,130
What a waste of my time.

630
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,930
I almost wanna just get the...

631
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,730
Look at... he's like stomping down.

632
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,290
He's just as mad as I am.

633
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,430
He's like...

634
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,450
There's not supposed to be guys there.

635
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,930
What the heck did they...

636
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,870
Why did they add more security to the...

637
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,470
I'm just so angry.

638
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,990
Where's their men?

639
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,570
I...

640
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,410
I swear.

641
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,170
Those guys.

642
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,990
They shouldn't even realize that he hasn't reported those so quickly.

643
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,310
I just can't with them.

644
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,130
Sometimes they wanna be so dumb.

645
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,450
And other times they actually wanna be 180 IQ.

646
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,450
It's just not fair.

647
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,430
That's literally me.

648
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,270
I can't shoot from...

649
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:11,730
Oh wait.

650
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,610
I can't shoot at all.

651
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,950
I can't shoot at all.

652
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,170
Oh...

653
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,030
Oh...

654
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:19,890
Oh...

655
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,330
God.

656
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,270
Maybe the book would help here.

657
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,470
There's the camera here.

658
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,530
Hey boss, I gotta go.

659
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,910
I promise to watch the VOD later.

660
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,830
Thank you!

661
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,830
Good luck with whatever you're doing or have fun.

662
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:38,870
GLHF.

663
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:39,950
Good luck.

664
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,470
Have fun.

665
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,990
Isn't there a truck here?

666
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,550
There is.

667
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,910
It's just that I got spotted so quickly before that I was like...

668
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,130
You know what?

669
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:46,690
I'm not gonna bother.

670
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,310
But...

671
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,010
Oh.

672
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,670
Here comes this guy.

673
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:52,630
Oh.

674
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,670
You did not see me.

675
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,230
No?

676
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,850
Absolutely not.

677
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,850
Excuse me!

678
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,550
Don't be like that.

679
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,930
That was insane.

680
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,740
Time to crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl.

681
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,360
Crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl.

682
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,900
Box, box.

683
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:20,820
Oh.

684
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,580
I was like...

685
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,340
What do you mean no use?

686
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,480
Don't tell me that.

687
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,560
It's so scary when they say that.

688
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:27,900
Okay.

689
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,600
The camera is right there.

690
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,900
I can probably...

691
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,660
Go in here.

692
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,100
Oh.

693
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,920
We don't see the other guy.

694
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,240
Okay.

695
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,640
Yep, yep, yep.

696
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,320
Hahaha.

697
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,060
Okay.

698
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,540
I think I see them meeting up.

699
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,980
They're doing their kissing.

700
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,030
I think I need to go.

701
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:29,850
Slow and steady.

702
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,690
I don't know where the other guy is.

703
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,030
That's why I'm trying to be so cautious.

704
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,170
I wanna get caught.

705
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:36,710
Wait.

706
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,050
No.

707
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,770
That's the guy up there.

708
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,150
Where?

709
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:38,670
Okay.

710
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,870
So he takes a really long time to get around here.

711
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,130
There he is.

712
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:43,850
Okay.

713
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,790
Surveillance camera.

714
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:47,270
Oh yes.

715
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:47,830
Here they are.

716
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,050
They're meeting up.

717
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:58,910
No.

718
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,330
Get up.

719
00:32:59,350 --> 00:32:59,630
Get up.

720
00:32:59,670 --> 00:32:59,870
Snake.

721
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:00,630
Snake please.

722
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:00,930
God.

723
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:02,990
Okay.

724
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,030
Alright.

725
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,050
Okay.

726
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,050
We're all good.

727
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,010
Notice me.

728
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,050
I'm just a little box.

729
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,590
I'm just a precious innocent little box.

730
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,150
I just wanna go to the heliport.

731
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,950
Is this all there is to load?

732
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,950
To the heliport, huh?

733
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:22,830
Yeah.

734
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,370
To the heliport, huh?

735
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,210
Take me there.

736
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,110
Take me there.

737
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:31,890
Oh my gosh.

738
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,210
I'm just a little box.

739
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,550
I'm just a little box.

740
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,330
You know what?

741
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:42,890
I feel like we haven't heard that line very much this time.

742
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,770
I feel like usually when I play this I always hear Just a box.

743
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,830
But this time I haven't heard it at all.

744
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:51,750
Okay.

745
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,630
I have some magazines here.

746
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:53,930
You know what?

747
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,470
I am gonna set one right there.

748
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,710
And I'm gonna crawl under.

749
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,890
Because I think this guy...

750
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:01,190
Oh.

751
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:02,450
See?

752
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,430
Let him get distracted by that.

753
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,150
And we're gonna take this guy.

754
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,150
We're gonna...

755
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,890
We're gonna get you in the legs.

756
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,710
And he's gonna fall asleep for real.

757
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,710
He was sleeping?

758
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,650
Yeah, but he'll wake up.

759
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,270
Now he'll fall asleep.

760
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,210
Actually.

761
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,830
Now he'll like pass out.

762
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,490
You got it, box.

763
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,010
There we go.

764
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,530
And our other friend is distracted.

765
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,330
So we can...

766
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,100
I can't tell what is the camera.

767
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:54,900
Wait.

768
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,040
What is the camera?

769
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,200
I can't...

770
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,820
Is the camera just fixed?

771
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,140
Okay.

772
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,720
You know what?

773
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,640
In...

774
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,500
In we go.

775
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,680
Snake.

776
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,280
Snake.

777
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,060
Snake.

778
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,740
Please.

779
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,860
Snake, what are you doing?

780
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,300
Snake.

781
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,380
SNAKE!

782
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,040
What are you doing?

783
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,740
Snake, please!

784
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,900
Why is it so difficult?

785
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,160
Oh my goodness.

786
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,860
Snake.

787
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,500
Snake.

788
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,120
I was accidentally teabagging him.

789
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,520
That was not the intent.

790
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,040
Where was it?

791
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,960
He's really grateful probably.

792
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,440
Do you think there's anything over here?

793
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,280
At all?

794
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,400
I think I check every time, but...

795
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,340
Who knows?

796
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,020
Something might appear.

797
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,490
Can I shoot from here?

798
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,510
Scoop back a little.

799
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,390
I could!

800
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,570
I could shoot from here.

801
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,350
Oh, but then they'll be like...

802
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,510
Where are you?

803
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,590
Yeah.

804
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:13,730
This is like class A micromanaging.

805
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:20,610
The fact that he has to send a little status report every two seconds is insane.

806
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,710
Your manager must be so annoying.

807
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,430
Just always...

808
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,070
Nothing here.

809
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,310
Nothing here.

810
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,670
I think I would go insane if someone kept reporting that to me.

811
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,790
Every two seconds.

812
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,510
Nothing here.

813
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,310
Nothing here.

814
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,630
Nothing here.

815
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,570
I'm a little fish.

816
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,670
I'm a little fish in the sea.

817
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,370
I'm a little drowning fish.

818
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,450
Get out of the water.

819
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,190
The RTO is just lonely.

820
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,490
Look at that.

821
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,830
He'd be a little less lonely if there was something here though.

822
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:00,850
Nothing here.

823
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,090
Nothing here.

824
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:06,750
I love the way they say it in MGS2.

825
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,090
Nothing here.

826
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,110
Okay.

827
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,030
Sounds very close.

828
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,350
Where are you?

829
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:22,830
Hello?

830
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,990
You are the true Vtuber.

831
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,750
Thank you.

832
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,850
Thank you so much.

833
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,510
Oh, there he is.

834
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,810
If I get him though...

835
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,170
I think the footsteps I'm hearing are the guy upstairs.

836
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,270
Right?

837
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,710
Okay, he's doing his thing.

838
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:46,250
Going around.

839
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,870
If I get him though, he's gonna... they're gonna do a status report.

840
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,130
But I feel like I have to get him.

841
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,650
Nothing here.

842
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,170
There's no...

843
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,070
Okay, yeah.

844
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:15,650
Where is he?

845
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:17,770
What?

846
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,190
No way.

847
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:20,610
What?

848
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,090
That way?

849
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,570
No way.

850
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,530
Can you just...

851
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,710
Wait, hold on.

852
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,930
I'm just gonna go back and...

853
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:30,290
Shoot.

854
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:31,930
I didn't even see you.

855
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,650
Go away.

856
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,290
Yeah, go away.

857
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,770
How the heck did you see me?

858
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,710
Oh my god, Snake.

859
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,650
Just go back to your hole.

860
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,270
Just go back to the hole, Snake.

861
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:42,570
Where's the hole?

862
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:43,530
There it is.

863
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,490
Crawl, crawl.

864
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:45,690
Crawl on in.

865
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:46,830
No pursuit!

866
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,250
What do you mean?

867
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,850
You're not gonna crawl after me, are you?

868
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,190
That would be ridiculous.

869
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,510
Oh no!

870
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,440
Can you see me?

871
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,810
Oh my gosh.

872
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,770
You and your perfect vision.

873
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,670
Why don't they ever hire guys that need glasses, huh?

874
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,190
Billy, welcome to membership.

875
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:34,890
Thank you.

876
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:41,190
Yeah, I'll hug the walls next time.

877
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:48,450
You know, the CQC jumpkick really sells me on the idea that this is Otacon's retelling of the Shadowmode system.

878
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,010
They hired Otacon.

879
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,030
Yeah, but that guy's like...

880
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,850
He... you know, he's a nerd.

881
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,590
They really just said nothing here.

882
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:05,210
Oh!

883
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,400
Where are they going?

884
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,080
Where do they... oh!

885
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,500
I don't think there's a door in there.

886
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,600
I don't think there's another...

887
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,920
Where do they go to?

888
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,420
Hmm... where?

889
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,080
Where do they go to?

890
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,400
Have you ever watched animated parodies of Metal Gear games like Metal Gear Awesome?

891
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,480
I did watch Crab Battle before, yeah.

892
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,220
I think I watched Metal Gear Awesome as a kid.

893
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,420
Mint is cute today also, but not as cute as Snake.

894
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,020
No one's as cute as Snake.

895
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,840
But thanks for the super chat.

896
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,400
They hired a whole Otaku convention, exactly.

897
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:49,860
Okay.

898
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,100
Nothing here.

899
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,160
Yeah, nothing here.

900
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,560
Oh my gosh.

901
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,220
This guy sucks so much.

902
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,800
Oh, whoops.

903
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,860
That's cause I'm crawling.

904
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,640
It's still taking me a second to get used to which one is...

905
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,380
what is, uh...

906
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,880
what is...

907
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,120
crawl and what is not and all that fun stuff, you know.

908
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,660
No, I don't wanna go in there.

909
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,100
I'm hugging the walls.

910
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,360
I'm hugging the walls.

911
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,000
Where's our friend who comes over here?

912
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,060
Is he gonna come over here?

913
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Actually, I don't know.

914
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,740
I don't know his patrol route.

915
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:32,620
Hmm...

916
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:33,760
Hmm...

917
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,040
Lucky Nag.

918
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,780
Welcome to membership.

919
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,380
Thank you.

920
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,100
Oh.

921
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,460
Oh, he thought he saw me.

922
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,080
Oh my gosh.

923
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,740
Wait, did he just say...

924
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,660
He didn't say just a box or anything, right?

925
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,420
There he is.

926
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:48,700
Okay.

927
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,420
He's reporting.

928
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,500
Nothing here.

929
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,280
Nothing here.

930
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,540
One thing I really wanna learn to get better at is like getting the...

931
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,920
shooting the... what's it called?

932
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,640
You know, the...

933
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:05,620
the...

934
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,500
the remotes.

935
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,780
Trust your instincts as a soldier.

936
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,720
As a gamer!

937
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,480
Yeah, the radio!

938
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,600
What did I call it?

939
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,920
I don't know what I called it.

940
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:25,780
B1?

941
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,760
No, B2.

942
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,720
It's B2.

943
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,840
Yeah, the radios.

944
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,100
Wait, can I actually go in here?

945
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,100
Ah!

946
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,020
Six.

947
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,700
Did I hear something?

948
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:45,980
Hmm.

949
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,660
Oh, it was... I heard the music.

950
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,360
Yeah, get in the radio.

951
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,240
Oh, B2.

952
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,480
I could never get down shooting the radio in any game.

953
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,140
It's really... I mean, it's like the tiniest target, right?

954
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,260
Oh my gosh.

955
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,940
Oh my gosh, that guy was right there.

956
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,960
I think every time I start, he's always right there.

957
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:12,860
Okay.

958
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,340
PSG...

959
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:16,920
is...

960
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:18,900
somewhere.

961
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,000
Um...

962
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,040
Somewhere in here.

963
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,440
Alright, let's just let these guys kind of... Oh!

964
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,280
Rendezvous!

965
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,570
Just gotta go for it.

966
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,390
Oh my god, the trap is still open.

967
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,430
This side.

968
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:48,910
C4.

969
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,070
Akita.

970
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,030
Does he come around here?

971
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:53,030
Oh my god.

972
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:53,470
Ah!

973
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:53,950
No!

974
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:54,750
No!

975
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:55,630
I didn't...

976
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,390
I didn't B2.

977
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:04,500
No.

978
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,100
No, I'm just a box.

979
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:06,780
I'm...

980
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:11,160
This is so messed up.

981
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,260
This is so...

982
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,460
This is so messed up.

983
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,280
I can't believe you can turn on the safety on this thing.

984
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,100
I guess maybe if you're trying to hold up someone and you, uh...

985
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,280
You don't wanna...

986
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,320
You don't wanna kill them for real.

987
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,460
Okay, let's see.

988
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,300
How do I get out of this predicament?

989
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,020
Hmm...

990
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,900
Okay, I'm on rations.

991
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:42,460
Okay.

992
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,400
Slowly standing up.

993
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:45,940
And fire!

994
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,000
Fire!

995
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,720
Fire at whoever is...

996
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:48,880
Oh!

997
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,880
I'm not firing at anyone!

998
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,020
Oh my god.

999
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:51,620
Um...

1000
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,660
I'm... Oh!

1001
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,020
Kill you!

1002
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,040
Hey!

1003
00:44:59,220 --> 00:44:59,580
Hey!

1004
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,220
Oh my gosh.

1005
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,020
You don't think they'll see me right here, right?

1006
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,140
I hate...

1007
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,620
I hate you!

1008
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,320
Why do you have to be...

1009
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:21,840
Oh my god!

1010
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,640
Where did you come from?

1011
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:24,580
Oh.

1012
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,760
I'm so far away from you.

1013
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:26,980
Yeah.

1014
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:27,340
Yeah.

1015
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:29,840
Stop!

1016
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:30,600
Stop!

1017
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,300
Stop it!

1018
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,260
Leave me alone!

1019
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,760
Okay, let's retry that.

1020
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,940
Let's... Maybe there's a ration in here.

1021
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:45,240
I can run.

1022
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:47,660
Oh!

1023
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,100
Oh!

1024
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,680
Oh!

1025
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,400
Oh my god.

1026
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:53,680
Oh!

1027
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,100
We were so close!

1028
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,880
To using that other ration.

1029
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,020
My...

1030
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,540
I panicked.

1031
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,340
And like my...

1032
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,280
And I did a little 360 with my...

1033
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,080
With the stick.

1034
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,880
Okay, let's see.

1035
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,260
There's some stuff in here probably.

1036
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:10,900
Right?

1037
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,380
Yeah!

1038
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,220
There's still some stuff in here.

1039
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,980
Get everything but it.

1040
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,660
Anything in here?

1041
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,560
Probably can unequip this.

1042
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:21,500
Nice.

1043
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,200
Okay.

1044
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,220
Let's just take a little bit of stuff.

1045
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,520
All according to plan, of course, as always.

1046
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:26,900
Yeah.

1047
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,460
It was obviously my intention to just get more...

1048
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,600
More stuff.

1049
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,660
Obviously.

1050
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,620
Duh.

1051
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,320
Nothing under here.

1052
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,220
Meryl, you stingy.

1053
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,960
Just as planned.

1054
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:49,920
Nasty.

1055
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:51,800
More books.

1056
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:52,940
I'll take it.

1057
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,020
Is there anything...

1058
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:55,980
Oh wait.

1059
00:46:58,740 --> 00:46:59,580
I'll take it.

1060
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,720
I can't take it.

1061
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,980
Too many of it.

1062
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,900
And I don't think...

1063
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,380
Was there...

1064
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,500
Hmm.

1065
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:09,740
Hmm.

1066
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,220
I think there's stuff up here.

1067
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,420
Climb.

1068
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:16,760
Oh.

1069
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,960
I can't climb it anymore.

1070
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,040
It won't let me go into the vents.

1071
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,880
I can go into these vents though.

1072
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:25,660
Okay.

1073
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,400
Who would have thought that it would take...

1074
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,820
It would be this difficult.

1075
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:31,980
Yeah!

1076
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,860
I knew it.

1077
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,740
That would be this difficult just to get the dang PSG.

1078
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,060
Well, difficult for me.

1079
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,260
Alright.

1080
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,380
One thing I love though about this game.

1081
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,520
Is when you are down.

1082
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,240
And then you press to stand back up.

1083
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,880
It doesn't put you just into the crouch.

1084
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,140
It actually stands you up.

1085
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,440
Because that would get me so many games where I would be like lying down and I'd be trying to stand up.

1086
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,620
And then I stood up like this, you know.

1087
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,720
Oh yeah, save.

1088
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,480
Good plan.

1089
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:04,880
Wait.

1090
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,120
Um.

1091
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:08,860
With A.

1092
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:09,940
Yes.

1093
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,120
Start and A button.

1094
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:11,500
Okay.

1095
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:13,700
Campbell!

1096
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,440
I wonder if he tells me that there's one.

1097
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,540
What's it called?

1098
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:32,740
One.

1099
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,120
Have you ever seen a sniper rifle anywhere on this base?

1100
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,360
A sniper rifle?

1101
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,640
Meryl's been shot by an extremely good sniper.

1102
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:42,800
Sniper.

1103
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,560
Sniper.

1104
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,680
A high quality sniper rifle is the only way I can fight back.

1105
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,200
I wonder if he tells me about the Tranquiline.

1106
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,600
I saw one in the armory in the second floor basement of the tank hangar.

1107
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,940
The second floor basement of the tank hangar?

1108
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,420
I have to go all the way back there.

1109
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,380
It's literally me.

1110
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,360
Yeah.

1111
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,440
What's wrong with you Otacon?

1112
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:00,620
Nothing.

1113
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,860
He sounds good.

1114
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,320
I'm so...

1115
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:06,980
so shy.

1116
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,480
Nothing.

1117
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,520
You know.

1118
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,520
Don't worry about it.

1119
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,400
He wouldn't get it.

1120
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,720
There's nothing.

1121
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,560
You need to make snap decisions.

1122
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,300
In war, the difference between living and dying is counted in milliseconds.

1123
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:25,160
True.

1124
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,260
I made those decisions.

1125
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:27,960
I made good ones.

1126
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,620
I made good ones, Master.

1127
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,960
Like turning around.

1128
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,000
You cannot win without a sniper rifle.

1129
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,120
You cannot save the girl either.

1130
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,980
Find a sniper rifle.

1131
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,300
It is the only way to save Meryl.

1132
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,700
Only way.

1133
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,480
Meiling.

1134
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,920
I could have used your advice.

1135
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,320
I did.

1136
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,540
Let's save since we're here.

1137
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,780
We're gonna save.

1138
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,120
Yes.

1139
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,880
Whatever you say, Nastasha.

1140
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,100
Alright.

1141
00:49:59,100 --> 00:49:59,420
B.

1142
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,020
B.

1143
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:00,460
B.

1144
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,940
There's a Chinese proverb.

1145
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,440
The mind cannot be in two places at once.

1146
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,800
Make sure you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?

1147
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,420
I'm thinking of you, baby girl.

1148
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,000
I'm thinking of you, baby girl.

1149
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,060
I'm thinking of you, baby girl.

1150
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,660
Okay, turn the sound back down.

1151
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,760
For some reason, the...

1152
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,280
The um...

1153
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,460
The codex are so...

1154
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,100
The audio is so low.

1155
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:30,760
Okay.

1156
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,240
Back to B2.

1157
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,140
I don't even know where the PSG is.

1158
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,160
I was just going...

1159
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,580
I was going the...

1160
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,840
I don't even know if I was going the right way.

1161
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:43,940
I don't even know.

1162
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,120
Wait.

1163
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,680
Those guys are still knocked out.

1164
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,340
No way.

1165
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,080
Wait a second.

1166
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:08,780
No way.

1167
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,530
Yeah, I'm gonna tranq them.

1168
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,050
I have to make sure I do this correctly, though.

1169
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:22,890
You know?

1170
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:23,970
Okay.

1171
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,300
Never mind.

1172
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,460
Never mind.

1173
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,560
Never mind!

1174
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,410
Well, they can't take the elevator.

1175
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:54,370
Because it's occupied.

1176
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:59,850
I wish I could shoot from the box, man.

1177
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,890
It would be so nice to be able to shoot from the box.

1178
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:06,490
It would be so nice to be able to shoot from the box.

1179
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,870
They won't look in here, right?

1180
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:09,970
They won't look in here, right?

1181
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:13,850
They won't look in here, right?

1182
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,390
I just gotta wait it out a little bit.

1183
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:15,870
I just gotta wait it out a little bit.

1184
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:17,750
Too OP?

1185
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,290
Probably, yeah.

1186
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:21,570
Look at this guy.

1187
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,470
What are you doing over there in the corner?

1188
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:24,790
Oh, yeah.

1189
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:26,550
Go look around.

1190
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,710
Do your job.

1191
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:30,610
There's a maniac on the loose.

1192
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:32,470
He's absolutely wild.

1193
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:34,110
Oh, there he goes.

1194
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:36,730
Stay sharp, everybody.

1195
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:38,110
Okay.

1196
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,190
Okay, they have a reset.

1197
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:42,490
Very good.

1198
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:43,150
Very nice.

1199
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:44,010
Okay.

1200
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,850
This guy's gonna come.

1201
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:49,310
He's gonna be like...

1202
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:53,190
The reason I keep going to the right...

1203
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:53,950
Is...

1204
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:55,570
Because...

1205
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:58,230
Well, I guess my left.

1206
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,010
The left...

1207
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:01,450
The...

1208
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:04,050
The right of the...

1209
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:05,810
You know where I'm going.

1210
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:08,530
The reason I keep going that way is because I'm most...

1211
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,150
Familiar with that guy's...

1212
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:11,330
Pattern.

1213
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:12,170
That guy's route.

1214
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,410
So, it's a little easier for me.

1215
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:18,850
The...

1216
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:21,230
The radar...

1217
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:23,750
Right...

1218
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,090
My... Like snakes...

1219
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:26,990
Snakes left.

1220
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:29,050
Yeah.

1221
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:31,770
Who's right?

1222
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,230
Who's on first base?

1223
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:38,310
Okay.

1224
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:39,310
Can I go now?

1225
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,000
I'm so scared.

1226
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,140
I don't want to get caught again.

1227
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,480
Come on, guys.

1228
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,240
Don't even worry about me.

1229
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,420
I'm just a box.

1230
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,100
Just a little box.

1231
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,560
I don't know where the PSG is.

1232
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,240
Please turn away.

1233
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:14,430
I keep thinking this is a hole in the ground.

1234
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:16,050
It scares me so much.

1235
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:18,510
Where am I?

1236
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:20,410
Smoking.

1237
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,020
A little left.

1238
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:33,370
Is he coming down?

1239
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:34,470
Where does he go?

1240
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:35,590
Where are these two guys?

1241
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:36,670
These guys gang up.

1242
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:37,990
That's why I got caught.

1243
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:40,290
Okay, this guy goes down and he comes...

1244
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:41,090
This way.

1245
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:42,570
Yeah.

1246
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,410
And then he goes up?

1247
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,130
He stops there?

1248
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:46,450
Turned around?

1249
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:47,410
Turned around.

1250
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:50,270
Then he goes up.

1251
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:53,330
Yeah.

1252
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,040
Is this it?

1253
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,000
This is the hand grenades.

1254
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:04,720
Dang it.

1255
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:11,230
Nah.

1256
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,870
Every second you wait, Meryl gets close to death?

1257
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:15,010
Good.

1258
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:17,170
Good.

1259
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:22,650
Are they camping it up there?

1260
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,270
It's not that one up there, is it?

1261
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,010
It can't be that one.

1262
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:27,950
The one that the guy is literally standing in front of.

1263
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:29,390
It can't be that one, right?

1264
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,580
How do I get past this guy?

1265
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:06,090
I can't see it.

1266
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:08,770
Just a box.

1267
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:13,450
Just a box.

1268
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,030
I think he's right in front of it.

1269
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,270
I think it's that one.

1270
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,070
Just prank him.

1271
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:19,450
I'm scared.

1272
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:21,490
Hold on.

1273
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:21,930
Okay.

1274
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:23,330
Okay.

1275
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:23,870
Okay.

1276
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,950
Once the bottom guy goes to the top...

1277
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,850
We're gonna run right past him.

1278
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:30,950
When he turns around.

1279
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,250
I think he looks here.

1280
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:34,310
Yeah.

1281
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,170
He looks down here.

1282
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:36,730
And he goes up.

1283
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:38,610
And... Okay.

1284
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,070
Don't notice me.

1285
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:42,370
Please, God.

1286
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,260
Okay.

1287
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,260
We're just gonna have to blast through him...

1288
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:10,880
And then go up.

1289
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,580
We're gonna...

1290
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,680
We're gonna blast through him.

1291
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,480
And then go up.

1292
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:37,990
No.

1293
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,010
I was trying to...

1294
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:39,270
Wait.

1295
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:41,090
Maybe I pressed start B on accident.

1296
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:44,250
Hold on.

1297
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:44,650
I'm busy.

1298
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:45,490
Please.

1299
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:46,930
I'm busy right now.

1300
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:48,750
I'm busy.

1301
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:51,070
Oh my God.

1302
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:51,370
Please.

1303
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:52,310
I'm trying to...

1304
00:57:59,150 --> 00:57:59,730
Oh.

1305
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:01,490
Press the button.

1306
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,070
How are you hitting me?

1307
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:16,710
How are you hitting me?

1308
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:18,030
If I can't hit you, you can't hit me, bitch!

1309
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:19,270
If

1310
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:23,340
I can't hit you, you can't hit me, bitch!

1311
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:23,840
Elevator's here.

1312
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,100
Oh.

1313
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:26,900
It doesn't work.

1314
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:27,640
Oh.

1315
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:28,020
I'm...

1316
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:28,860
Oh.

1317
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:38,470
I think they noticed me.

1318
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:38,910
You think?

1319
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:42,910
We have no more...

1320
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:45,810
We have no more...

1321
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:49,010
Why does the thing have to be there?

1322
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,310
Why does the thing have to be there?

1323
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:52,570
You son of a...

1324
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,610
Bitch.

1325
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,830
You son of a bitch!

1326
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:02,940
Snake, are you okay?

1327
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,300
Snake!

1328
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:06,800
I'm not okay.

1329
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,980
I'm not okay.

1330
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,020
I'm actually molding.

1331
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:12,800
Oh my God.

1332
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,840
Why do I have to have...

1333
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,000
Why do I have to...

1334
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,600
Why?

1335
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:25,400
Why did I have to be like...

1336
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,080
I was gonna say...

1337
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,340
Why did I have to be...

1338
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,240
Why do I have to be so like...

1339
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:48,560
Like...

1340
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:48,700
Oh.

1341
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,200
I don't want the tranquilizer.

1342
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,700
I want the legit thing.

1343
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,600
I want the real deal.

1344
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:53,120
Okay.

1345
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:53,660
Can I get a rock?

1346
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:04,790
Okay.

1347
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:05,350
Okay.

1348
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:05,610
Okay.

1349
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:05,790
Okay.

1350
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:12,550
This side.

1351
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:14,690
Wait.

1352
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:16,170
Wait.

1353
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:16,630
Wait.

1354
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:17,070
I didn't...

1355
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:22,650
They're not gonna notice me.

1356
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:25,670
Okay.

1357
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,370
Just kill me.

1358
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:26,830
Just kill me.

1359
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:27,350
Just kill me.

1360
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:29,350
Just kill me.

1361
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:29,750
Just kill me.

1362
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:30,150
Just kill me.

1363
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:30,910
No.

1364
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:32,110
I won't let you kill me.

1365
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:33,190
Where's the hole?

1366
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:34,490
I'll kill myself!

1367
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,580
I knew the guy was gonna turn around.

1368
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,920
I knew the guy was gonna turn around.

1369
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,300
So I was gonna have to be like...

1370
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:44,580
Oh shoot.

1371
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:45,240
Okay.

1372
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,360
When I go in there...

1373
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:50,680
Once I make my move...

1374
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,320
Once I make my move...

1375
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,500
You're free to go past the guard.

1376
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:54,840
Okay.

1377
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:57,860
Okay.

1378
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:58,760
Now turn around.

1379
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:08,990
Okay.

1380
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:11,390
Okay.

1381
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:11,910
Okay.

1382
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:13,150
Okay.

1383
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,570
Are they gonna come in here or...

1384
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:18,170
You know what?

1385
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:19,450
I'm just gonna wait it out and see.

1386
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,010
I'm just gonna wait it out.

1387
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:25,610
I'm just gonna wait it out.

1388
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:26,750
Are they gonna come in here?

1389
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:31,370
Past me.

1390
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,930
I can't get the tranq PSG one.

1391
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:36,470
Because it's not canon to the game.

1392
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:37,750
Me right now.

1393
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:39,750
I hate past me.

1394
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:41,270
You know what?

1395
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:42,610
Past me sucks.

1396
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:44,010
Past me has bad ideas.

1397
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:45,230
I...

1398
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:46,690
I...

1399
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,050
It's going down.

1400
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,510
I'm too afraid to move.

1401
01:01:57,770 --> 01:01:59,170
Because the door is gonna open.

1402
01:01:59,390 --> 01:01:59,970
Because the door is gonna open.

1403
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,890
Just let all these guys...

1404
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:08,050
Just let all these guys...

1405
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:09,250
Go away.

1406
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:11,150
Go away.

1407
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:14,350
Okay.

1408
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:14,950
Okay.

1409
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,670
Now I know this guy stays here.

1410
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:19,310
But I just wanted less guys around.

1411
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:20,130
But I just wanted less guys around.

1412
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:21,770
Okay.

1413
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,640
Is the door still open?

1414
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,020
I didn't hear it shut.

1415
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:38,480
You know what?

1416
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:38,980
Whatever.

1417
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:39,840
Oh, there it is.

1418
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,000
I can't tell.

1419
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,600
I can't tell.

1420
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,600
I think it reopened again.

1421
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:59,170
If I have to go backwards...

1422
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:00,390
I have to go backwards.

1423
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:07,910
No, please.

1424
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:09,510
Please.

1425
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:11,190
I'm just a worm.

1426
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:12,810
I'm just a worm.

1427
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:14,690
I'm just a worm.

1428
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,250
I'm just a worm.

1429
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:17,330
I'm just a little guy.

1430
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:18,750
I'm just a little wormy guy.

1431
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:21,650
Why did the door have to open?

1432
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:25,890
Why did the door have to open?

1433
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:28,890
Oh, God.

1434
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:32,210
I made it there so...

1435
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:35,610
It was so clean too.

1436
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:42,740
He's gonna turn around.

1437
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,020
Okay.

1438
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:47,480
I'm under attack.

1439
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,200
Okay.

1440
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:51,450
Is it open or not?

1441
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:52,630
I can't tell at all.

1442
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:56,600
Okay.

1443
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:56,980
It's open.

1444
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,400
How am I supposed to...

1445
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,540
I'm under attack.

1446
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,440
Stay alert.

1447
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:04,400
I'm under attack.

1448
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:04,400
Stay alert.

1449
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,900
How am I supposed to get through?

1450
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:06,280
How am I supposed to get through?

1451
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,200
The red line...

1452
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,020
means it's open?

1453
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:16,400
I'm guessing.

1454
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:16,940
I'm guessing.

1455
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,320
You can see in the minimap if it's open.

1456
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,960
I couldn't tell before though.

1457
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:29,900
It's closed.

1458
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:30,780
Are you sure?

1459
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:32,860
Are you sure?

1460
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:34,760
Red line is closed.

1461
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:53,380
Yes!

1462
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:56,760
Cradle!

1463
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,140
You got a sniper rifle?

1464
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,740
You can use that against Sniper Wolf.

1465
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:00,960
After.

1466
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,680
Hurry up and save Meryl.

1467
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:02,780
You can use that against Sniper Wolf.

1468
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:03,040
I'm trying.

1469
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,660
I don't want to save her anymore.

1470
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:06,660
She doesn't deserve it.

1471
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,040
She doesn't deserve my lava.

1472
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:13,420
After everything I've been through, Colonel.

1473
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,540
Oh, I see it!

1474
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,320
I see what you guys mean though.

1475
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:33,640
Okay.

1476
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:36,500
That guy...

1477
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,300
Once he turns around...

1478
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:41,920
Pass this.

1479
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,040
Here.

1480
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,120
Whew.

1481
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:46,840
Okay.

1482
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,190
Oh shoot.

1483
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:51,530
Okay.

1484
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:52,010
We're good.

1485
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:53,390
Okay.

1486
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:55,230
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1487
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:56,650
This guy's gonna come up.

1488
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:05,860
Oh.

1489
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:06,700
Nope.

1490
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,480
Press the button.

1491
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:10,400
Books.

1492
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:14,220
Shoooooo!

1493
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:18,700
Shoooooo!

1494
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,440
Oh.

1495
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:23,720
Metal Gear Gaming.

1496
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:25,320
Okay.

1497
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,740
Give me a break.

1498
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:28,380
Just give me...

1499
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,040
Give me one second in the B1.

1500
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:35,820
Holy moly.

1501
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:39,920
Okay.

1502
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,640
So now...

1503
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,300
Do you think there's that ration back there again?

1504
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:44,060
No wonder.

1505
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:47,960
Wouldn't it be kind of awesome if it respawned?

1506
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:49,640
Okay.

1507
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:54,520
Basha min!

1508
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:56,640
Hello!

1509
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,200
No.

1510
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,040
Imagine if you fell into that hole.

1511
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:04,820
What do you take me as?

1512
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:05,360
A rookie?

1513
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,820
I could not see that first one though.

1514
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:12,220
Okay.

1515
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,220
How do I want to do this?

1516
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:13,460
Let's see.

1517
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:14,660
Um...

1518
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:19,400
I'm gonna go to the Kusa Land concert tomorrow.

1519
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,520
But I've never gone to a concert by myself before.

1520
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:22,580
It's not a concert.

1521
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:24,220
It's like...

1522
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:26,800
It's like...

1523
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,480
It's like...

1524
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,980
It's so casual.

1525
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,520
Just wear whatever you want.

1526
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,140
It's just people playing anime music.

1527
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:36,880
That's all it is.

1528
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:41,060
It's just people playing anime music.

1529
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,280
Yeah.

1530
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:45,920
So...

1531
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:48,360
Don't feel like you have to dress up.

1532
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,040
Or dress up.

1533
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,940
Actually put on your best suit.

1534
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,620
I think it'd be awesome.

1535
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,260
Put on your best suit.

1536
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:00,180
Yeah.

1537
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:01,840
Okay.

1538
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:03,980
Um...

1539
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,320
I'm trying to think.

1540
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:10,180
Yeah.

1541
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,560
Probably going back to the...

1542
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,360
Well, if I go back to the truck...

1543
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,200
Okay.

1544
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:16,480
We'll have to knock that guy out.

1545
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,820
We'll have to shoot his little toes.

1546
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:19,440
That's okay.

1547
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,720
We can shoot his toes.

1548
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:23,640
We'll shoot his toes.

1549
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,420
You're producing an IDEL group made up of MGS characters.

1550
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,700
Name the unit and the center.

1551
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,340
He cannot be SNAKE.

1552
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,080
Center can be KAZ.

1553
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,180
I think he'd be a great.

1554
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:37,360
I think he'd be a great.

1555
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,180
KAZ or OSALOT.

1556
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:44,060
OSALOT could be a great center because he's got that appeal of...

1557
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,360
and I mean this.

1558
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,580
in the most loving way...

1559
01:08:54,880 --> 01:09:07,960
A little pause... and we are back.

1560
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:41,220
Let's see where this guy is.

1561
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,080
Like, who is that over there?

1562
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:44,900
Is that outside?

1563
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:46,800
Like me?

1564
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,440
A little quirky?

1565
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,860
No, I think I'm...

1566
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:52,400
I don't think like me.

1567
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:55,280
Oh, there he is.

1568
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,740
Okay, he's walking up.

1569
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,320
Yeah, exactly.

1570
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:15,890
This guy is not...

1571
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:16,290
No.

1572
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:21,550
I'm not having you come all the way down here to investigate my box.

1573
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:23,990
We are not doing that.

1574
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:24,910
Okay.

1575
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:30,930
Welcome to membership, you guys!

1576
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:31,830
Thank you so much!

1577
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:33,670
Like, okay, sorry.

1578
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:34,930
I was like half...

1579
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,630
being able to talk.

1580
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:40,990
So like, for example, part of like...

1581
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:43,790
For example, part of like...

1582
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:46,070
Ah-Chan from AKB.

1583
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:50,810
She was like the center for AKB for a super duper long time.

1584
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:51,870
And like...

1585
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:52,250
Oh my gosh.

1586
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:53,130
Why?

1587
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:57,390
Why is my O2 go down so fast?

1588
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:03,270
But part of her appeal was just like how uninterested she was.

1589
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:07,230
People are like, yeah, we kinda like that she's...

1590
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:09,310
Wait.

1591
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:11,230
Wait a second.

1592
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:13,030
Am I gonna...

1593
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:14,650
run into this guy?

1594
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:20,940
Okay.

1595
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,640
I was so scared for a second.

1596
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,360
Sorry, I gotta get your...

1597
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:31,940
Gotta get your ankles.

1598
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,460
Let's get you a couple times.

1599
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:36,900
Where's that coming from?

1600
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,940
Got mosquitoes in Alaska?

1601
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,660
That's wild.

1602
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:41,300
I know.

1603
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:42,700
I know, man.

1604
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:44,080
Must be hard.

1605
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,660
Oh, I forgot about his...

1606
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:47,880
Oh, no, no, no!

1607
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,840
Oh, can I...

1608
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,360
They already did the radio.

1609
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,460
Where is his radio?

1610
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,080
Where is his radio?

1611
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,480
Oh, shoot.

1612
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,360
Oh, shoot.

1613
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,460
Oh, shoot.

1614
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,720
But I don't know where to shoot.

1615
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:09,680
But I don't know where to shoot.

1616
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,140
But I

1617
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:18,120
don't know where to shoot.

1618
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,140
Just imagine...

1619
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,380
Freeze.

1620
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,000
Just imagining...

1621
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,440
Just imagining...

1622
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,080
I held him up!

1623
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:35,530
It's him.

1624
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:36,970
Everyone stay on guard.

1625
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:37,630
Freeze.

1626
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:42,860
No!

1627
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:43,280
No way!

1628
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,040
I can't.

1629
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:47,940
This is so funny.

1630
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,220
No way!

1631
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:51,660
Who's that?

1632
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,640
It's the enemy.

1633
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:53,140
Oh.

1634
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,700
There's no way he should have known.

1635
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,160
Do you think if I go back, I'll be fine?

1636
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,220
La la la.

1637
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:11,660
La la la.

1638
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:12,800
La la la.

1639
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,380
Why did he kick the guard?

1640
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:15,280
I don't know.

1641
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,380
La la la.

1642
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,760
La la la la la.

1643
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:24,020
Okay.

1644
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:24,920
Okay.

1645
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,600
When I shoot this guy, I have the most...

1646
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:33,400
short amount of time to run over to the truck.

1647
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:38,540
But I also have to make sure I am not seen going to the truck.

1648
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,480
Which is...

1649
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:41,880
I can't tell...

1650
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,360
This guy doesn't like walk around this way.

1651
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:47,360
Like the guy over there by the truck that will see me.

1652
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:49,360
Shoot guy chaff?

1653
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:52,060
That might work.

1654
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:53,840
That might work.

1655
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:00,960
I do have some stun grenades, but I think that'll make too much of a scene.

1656
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:02,720
Maybe.

1657
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,020
That'll make too much of a scene, right?

1658
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:09,580
Yeah, well the camera is what the chaff grenade would be for.

1659
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:13,320
Throw a magazine to lure him away.

1660
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,220
He'll come back though, right?

1661
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,140
Throw a magazine?

1662
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,840
You mean this magazine, not the...

1663
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:33,500
Let's lure him.

1664
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,600
We're throwing really far.

1665
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,320
All the way!

1666
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:42,000
Can I get between his legs?

1667
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:42,700
There!

1668
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,360
Oh, that did not go far, you guys.

1669
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,360
You guys, that didn't go very far.

1670
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:49,900
Oh!

1671
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:51,400
Okay, hold on.

1672
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,120
Now, I wonder if I can get his...

1673
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:57,840
Oh!

1674
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:58,480
Oh!

1675
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,040
I frozen!

1676
01:14:59,200 --> 01:14:59,800
I've got him!

1677
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:01,700
Um...

1678
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,120
If I hold this...

1679
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:05,980
Uh...

1680
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:07,400
Now...

1681
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,440
Wait, I'm frozen!

1682
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,620
I can't do anything!

1683
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:12,220
Uh...

1684
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,600
Hmm... Uh...

1685
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:14,620
Uh...

1686
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,020
Uh...

1687
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,720
I literally can't move!

1688
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,780
I can't... I can't get out!

1689
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,880
If I unequip, it unfreezes him!

1690
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:25,780
Oh, shoot!

1691
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:27,420
Okay, I'm gonna get you in the foot.

1692
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,080
Sorry, man.

1693
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:29,680
Uh...

1694
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:31,560
Uh... Get up!

1695
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:32,480
I can't!

1696
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,480
I am in...

1697
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,100
I am in the thing!

1698
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,180
Okay, sorry, guy.

1699
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,060
Freeze!

1700
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,220
How are you still standing?

1701
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:52,690
How are you still standing?

1702
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:53,690
How are you still standing?

1703
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:54,630
Uh...

1704
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:56,550
Uh...

1705
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:58,570
Stop aiming and crawl!

1706
01:15:58,590 --> 01:15:58,850
Stop aiming and crawl!

1707
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:02,330
Is he still gonna be frozen?

1708
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:03,550
Is he still gonna be frozen?

1709
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:04,070
Okay.

1710
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:09,830
Sorry, guy.

1711
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:11,450
I'm so sorry.

1712
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:13,970
Wait, actually, where's your radio?

1713
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:17,590
What's that?

1714
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:18,090
Nothing.

1715
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:21,870
It's nothing.

1716
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:27,050
What?

1717
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:27,550
What do you mean?

1718
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:28,810
Um...

1719
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:32,250
Uh-oh.

1720
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:35,650
Uh...

1721
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:36,390
Um...

1722
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:38,050
There doesn't need to be a backup unit.

1723
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:40,370
Uh...

1724
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:42,910
Uh...

1725
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,950
Just a couple guys are down!

1726
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,450
Just a couple guys are down!

1727
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:52,170
We have a man down!

1728
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:53,530
Increase to max...

1729
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,080
I just wanna get in here, please.

1730
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,400
Increase to max...

1731
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,460
The AWOL man!

1732
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:16,970
I even got his little radio.

1733
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:17,270
I even got his little radio.

1734
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:18,030
It was the other radio.

1735
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:20,230
They're so fast with the radios.

1736
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:22,090
Maybe because he died on the camera.

1737
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:25,010
But I had to kill the other guy.

1738
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:25,810
But I had to kill the other guy.

1739
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:26,330
Well, maybe I could've...

1740
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:30,510
No, I think even if I knocked him out, it still would've been bad.

1741
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:31,490
No, I think even if I knocked him out, it still would've been bad.

1742
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:32,310
Hmm...

1743
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:34,910
Yeah!

1744
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:47,090
Guard 2, remain there.

1745
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:49,470
I think this resets their positions, right?

1746
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:49,750
I think this resets their positions, right?

1747
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:50,730
Okay, so...

1748
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:52,470
If I come out...

1749
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:55,170
Quickly stand.

1750
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:56,670
Oh, no, they stopped.

1751
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:57,310
They just took their bodies.

1752
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:01,010
Okay, can anybody take me to the nuke building?

1753
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:07,380
Okay, can anybody take me to the nuke building?

1754
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:07,620
Uh -oh.

1755
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:09,600
Wait a second.

1756
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,680
Did I kill...

1757
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:12,800
Oh!

1758
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,940
I was gonna say...

1759
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:18,020
Is there nobody to take me to the nuke building?

1760
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:19,860
No one's gonna walk up and see me?

1761
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,140
Is this all there is to load?

1762
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:22,960
No one's gonna...

1763
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,040
Nuclear warhead storage, huh?

1764
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,060
Mm-hmm.

1765
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:29,980
That's right, sir.

1766
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,640
Nuclear warhead storage.

1767
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,700
I was so nervous.

1768
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:35,980
I was so worried for a second.

1769
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:40,700
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it's taken me an hour to get this dang PSG one.

1770
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,080
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it's taken me an hour to get this dang PSG one.

1771
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:42,280
Holy cow.

1772
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:43,080
Holy cow.

1773
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:47,300
Okay.

1774
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:50,920
Alright, so this is our guy.

1775
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,960
We have another guy who walks around.

1776
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:54,620
We have another guy who walks around.

1777
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,220
Wherever he might be.

1778
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,220
He's gonna come around.

1779
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:01,780
There he is.

1780
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:03,520
Yes.

1781
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:06,920
And I can't use anything here.

1782
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:08,580
I gotta be, like, all...

1783
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:09,860
skill.

1784
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:11,600
Okay.

1785
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,140
So...

1786
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,360
Once he goes...

1787
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:16,780
Hmm.

1788
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:21,980
Oh, please.

1789
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:22,380
Snake!

1790
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,000
Snake!

1791
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,040
Why aren't you leaving the truck?

1792
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:26,160
Snake!

1793
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:28,740
Oh, I can't jump out in the box.

1794
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:29,780
Okay, never mind.

1795
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:30,420
I think...

1796
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,280
That kind of ruined my plan a little bit.

1797
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,320
Sorry.

1798
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:38,020
I did not mean to scream like that.

1799
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,620
Our friend should be walking up here.

1800
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,620
Just a box for real.

1801
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,700
Just a box.

1802
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:04,620
Real.

1803
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:07,460
Real.

1804
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:07,620
Real.

1805
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:08,060
Real.

1806
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,280
Alright, we're just gonna go down this path.

1807
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:22,220
Um...

1808
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:27,090
Okay, there he is.

1809
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:28,190
There he is.

1810
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:28,650
Nice, nice, nice.

1811
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:30,330
Alright.

1812
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:30,750
Let's go!

1813
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:31,950
Save Mara!

1814
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:34,950
Okay.

1815
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,400
Now where's our friend up here?

1816
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:49,360
Nice.

1817
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,620
I wonder what that is over there.

1818
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:57,460
Okay, that's there.

1819
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,600
He's coming back.

1820
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,140
Oh, no.

1821
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:01,100
That's the guy downstairs.

1822
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:01,760
Oh, wait.

1823
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,560
How can I see what the guy upstairs is doing?

1824
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:04,660
Oh, I can't.

1825
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:05,220
Oh, there he is.

1826
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:05,260
There he is.

1827
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:05,860
There he is.

1828
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,140
Just hopping upstairs.

1829
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:11,420
Yeah.

1830
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:15,020
Okay.

1831
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:15,840
Turn around.

1832
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:24,390
Is he turning around?

1833
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:43,780
Yahoo!

1834
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:50,080
Get the PSG.

1835
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:52,220
Get the other one for completion.

1836
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:52,540
Oh, wait.

1837
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:53,180
I went to... Wait.

1838
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:53,700
Isn't it...

1839
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:54,460
Is it in here, actually?

1840
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,920
Is it the trunk in here?

1841
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,500
Is it... Is it this one?

1842
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:02,520
Uh...

1843
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:02,860
Actually,

1844
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:08,380
I don't know.

1845
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:08,820
Oh, wait.

1846
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:12,200
It might be one of the ones that, uh...

1847
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:14,280
Wait.

1848
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:15,960
Are all these... Oh, I can't go in there.

1849
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,500
All the cameras are still down.

1850
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,540
That's kind of awesome.

1851
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:19,840
Grenades full.

1852
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:22,200
Oh.

1853
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,360
Nikita full.

1854
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:29,900
M9 full.

1855
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,380
Oh, it's the Psycho Mantis area.

1856
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:33,980
Oh, my bad.

1857
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,800
For some reason, I thought it was in here.

1858
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:39,540
Uh...

1859
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,780
Anything in here?

1860
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,700
The Lady Magazine is worth it.

1861
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:46,200
Probably.

1862
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:49,760
I keep pressing the action button for...

1863
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:50,900
Oh, oh, oh.

1864
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,040
I keep pressing the action button for...

1865
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:54,500
trying to...

1866
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:56,300
look...

1867
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:58,980
in first person.

1868
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,940
I think I wasted enough time.

1869
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,600
I think we can just kind of go...

1870
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,400
to Merrill.

1871
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,480
I think I wasted enough time.

1872
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:14,900
When I was playing the Master Collection, I thought of you and I used your box method.

1873
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,040
It's actually very effective.

1874
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:16,880
It is!

1875
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,620
The box is awesome.

1876
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,360
The box is...

1877
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,380
life, you know?

1878
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,900
I only remember this area from MGS4?

1879
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:29,020
Really?

1880
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:35,130
Okay, I was going to say I think Metal Gear...

1881
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:37,830
Solid is the one that I remember the most of.

1882
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:39,370
Actually...

1883
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:42,690
when I do think about it, I think...

1884
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:47,510
Like...

1885
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:49,950
The point between...

1886
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:52,990
getting caught by...

1887
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:53,750
...

1888
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:56,670
Ocelot.

1889
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:58,790
Like, you know...

1890
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:00,570
Getting tortured by Ocelot.

1891
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:01,430
And...

1892
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:04,110
And...

1893
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:07,890
Going down the elevator...

1894
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:09,070
to Vulcan Raven.

1895
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:11,310
I know I fight the Hind D.

1896
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:12,950
But I just...

1897
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:15,030
I think I've erased that whole...

1898
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:16,870
spot out of my brain.

1899
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:18,750
I cannot remember...

1900
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,950
ever what goes on in between there.

1901
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:23,810
I know I have to go up the communications tower, but I'm like...

1902
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:25,350
How do I get there?

1903
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:27,250
And then I have to fight the guys in the elevator.

1904
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:28,090
But I'm like...

1905
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:29,730
When do I do that?

1906
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:32,330
It's just...

1907
01:24:32,330 --> 01:24:33,790
I think it's maybe...

1908
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:35,250
I don't want to say the most...

1909
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:37,390
unmemorable spot.

1910
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:40,130
But it's kind of unmemorable, you know?

1911
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:42,630
In a way.

1912
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:45,990
I think it's torture tower elevator.

1913
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:46,650
Right?

1914
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:49,130
Okay.

1915
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:50,650
Now we're gonna be the P-Box.

1916
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:52,670
See?

1917
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:54,130
Doggies love us.

1918
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:55,830
Oh!

1919
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:57,090
That's the PSG...

1920
01:24:57,830 --> 01:24:58,350
Trang...

1921
01:24:58,350 --> 01:24:59,090
That's so funny.

1922
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:02,050
Doggies, where's the exit?

1923
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:03,490
Oops, sorry.

1924
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:04,470
Did I hit you?

1925
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:05,470
Oh.

1926
01:25:05,490 --> 01:25:06,170
Oh my god!

1927
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:06,930
Little doggy.

1928
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:08,130
Nice.

1929
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:10,910
Okay, let's go fight Sniper Wolf.

1930
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:15,690
Yeah, I'm a P-Box right now.

1931
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:21,150
Oh my god.

1932
01:25:21,230 --> 01:25:22,070
Oh my god, please.

1933
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,440
I'm still P-Box.

1934
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:32,060
Oh!

1935
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:32,480
Oh!

1936
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:33,460
Dang it.

1937
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:35,440
Actually, I think it's fine.

1938
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,720
Because I think we're mostly...

1939
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,360
What's going on?

1940
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,480
I think it's time, you guys.

1941
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,480
They just throw you right in there.

1942
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,980
They're like, are you ready?

1943
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:54,200
Are you ready to fight Sniper Wolf?

1944
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:54,880
Okay.

1945
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:57,920
I have not used the PSG in this game yet before.

1946
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,900
So, let's see how this goes.

1947
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:02,040
Aim in first person view.

1948
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,220
Fire with A.

1949
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,480
Zoom in with B.

1950
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:07,320
Out with X.

1951
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:11,000
Time to take your pills.

1952
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,400
Wait.

1953
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:14,800
Uh...

1954
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,420
Gas mat?

1955
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:15,780
Oh, no.

1956
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,680
Wait, why am I over there?

1957
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,320
Why am I in third person all of a sudden?

1958
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:20,860
Who am I?

1959
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:25,200
Who are you?

1960
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,300
Huh?

1961
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:32,720
Oh, okay.

1962
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,140
Can I lay down with this?

1963
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:36,080
No.

1964
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:42,520
Crouch.

1965
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:43,800
Lay.

1966
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:45,820
Turn.

1967
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:46,340
Equip.

1968
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:54,080
I never can get the best angle for this.

1969
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:56,640
I can never figure it out.

1970
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:59,080
Can I just do it in first person?

1971
01:26:59,260 --> 01:26:59,580
Actually.

1972
01:26:59,720 --> 01:26:59,940
Oh.

1973
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:00,860
Hey, girly.

1974
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:02,840
A B and...

1975
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:03,260
Fire!

1976
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:03,940
Oh.

1977
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:04,260
Ow.

1978
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:10,130
Oh, my meds.

1979
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:11,730
I need my meds.

1980
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:13,270
Oh, I don't even need to lay down?

1981
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:14,270
Wait.

1982
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:16,850
I don't even need to lay down?

1983
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:18,710
It's kind of OP, right?

1984
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:22,690
You're gonna look this way.

1985
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:25,390
You're gonna look this way.

1986
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:27,970
Oh, shoot.

1987
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:28,970
Oh.

1988
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:29,830
I was so close.

1989
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:31,170
I was... Oh my god.

1990
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:31,810
Oh my god!

1991
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:39,300
Yep.

1992
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,080
There she goes.

1993
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:41,280
Okay.

1994
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:41,820
Oh, girl.

1995
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:42,380
Ouchie.

1996
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:44,060
Hi.

1997
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:48,700
Where are you?

1998
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:49,540
Madam?

1999
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:50,700
Hold on.

2000
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:51,700
I can't see anything.

2001
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:53,560
Let's go this way.

2002
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:56,360
Do I need to be crouching at all?

2003
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:58,380
I shot her in the cleavage?

2004
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:00,360
Exactly.

2005
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,940
All according to plan.

2006
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:08,560
Can I just be...

2007
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,800
I literally don't even have to be...

2008
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,380
Oh my gosh.

2009
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:17,220
This is insane.

2010
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:18,360
I don't have to be sitting?

2011
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,420
Is it probably better...

2012
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:20,520
Oh.

2013
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:20,940
Oh.

2014
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:21,400
Oh.

2015
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,920
It might be better...

2016
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:25,420
Run.

2017
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:25,700
Run.

2018
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:25,940
Run.

2019
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:26,180
Run.

2020
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:26,380
Run.

2021
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:26,600
Run.

2022
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:26,760
Run.

2023
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:26,860
Run.

2024
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:30,140
Maybe better...

2025
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:30,880
Like...

2026
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:41,020
Yes!

2027
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:42,400
Your hands tremble less.

2028
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:42,820
That's the word.

2029
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:43,800
Better...

2030
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:44,960
Stability.

2031
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,120
Stability is the word that I was thinking of.

2032
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:47,940
Oh my god.

2033
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:49,320
You guys.

2034
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:51,080
How do you even stand me?

2035
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,920
Good angle for you.

2036
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:58,240
Hello, madam.

2037
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:58,960
Oh.

2038
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,620
I must take my meds.

2039
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,740
I must take my meds, ma'am.

2040
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:05,740
No.

2041
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,120
Got you.

2042
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:09,840
Got you.

2043
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:10,360
Oh.

2044
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:10,920
And you got me.

2045
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:13,100
We did a little...

2046
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:14,400
Where are you?

2047
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:14,600
Oh.

2048
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:15,440
Wait.

2049
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,200
Actually, where are you?

2050
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:26,200
I'm throwing our offer game, you know?

2051
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:26,820
I'm throwing our offer game, you know?

2052
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:26,820
Okay.

2053
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:28,920
Now I zoom in.

2054
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:30,720
And I take my meds.

2055
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,300
I don't know why I cycled through the whole thing.

2056
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,240
Every time.

2057
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:37,340
Oh.

2058
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:44,270
She's gonna... Oh.

2059
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:44,770
Never mind.

2060
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:52,860
So sensitive.

2061
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,020
I got your cleavage.

2062
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,040
I got your cleavage.

2063
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:01,920
So sensitive.

2064
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,720
Kind of shaky.

2065
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:18,660
What did he say?

2066
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,220
There's no cameras here yet.

2067
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:31,640
If I remember correctly.

2068
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:39,800
A heartbeat?

2069
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:45,240
I thought I heard like a little heart...

2070
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:45,580
Oh yeah.

2071
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:49,000
There's like kind of like a really slow heartbeat like sound.

2072
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,140
Oh.

2073
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:53,740
Oh.

2074
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:54,020
Goodness.

2075
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,360
Oh.

2076
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:55,520
Oh.

2077
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:55,580
Goodness.

2078
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:55,800
Oh.

2079
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:55,800
Oh.

2080
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:55,800
Goodness.

2081
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,220
There is a camera there.

2082
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,860
I knew it.

2083
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,120
I knew it.

2084
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:03,520
Hmm.

2085
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:05,400
I want that though.

2086
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:09,750
I can get it.

2087
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:12,550
No.

2088
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:12,870
Snake.

2089
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:13,410
Look this way.

2090
01:31:15,190 --> 01:31:16,010
I can get it.

2091
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:16,850
Run!

2092
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:18,790
It was worth.

2093
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:20,910
Okay.

2094
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:21,230
Let's go.

2095
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:26,230
La la la.

2096
01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:27,590
Picking up the stuff.

2097
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:29,530
Oh.

2098
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:29,930
Oh.

2099
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:30,030
Oh.

2100
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:34,850
This game is way more generous on health items.

2101
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:37,410
But you know what I haven't picked up?

2102
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:40,350
I haven't picked very many chaff grenades.

2103
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:43,830
I have not picked so many chaff...

2104
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:44,250
No.

2105
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:44,410
No.

2106
01:31:44,450 --> 01:31:44,530
No.

2107
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:44,910
Not yet.

2108
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:55,720
Rods.

2109
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:57,120
Look at the rods.

2110
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:01,040
There we go.

2111
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:03,240
Okay.

2112
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,080
Oh.

2113
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:07,480
Codex.

2114
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:08,260
Calls before progress.

2115
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:09,100
You're so right.

2116
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:09,820
I should have done it.

2117
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:10,380
I'm so sorry.

2118
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:12,260
Don't move.

2119
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:13,220
Robin.

2120
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,040
Robin.

2121
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:15,600
It's me.

2122
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:16,800
Starfire.

2123
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:25,310
You do not wish to hurt me, Robin.

2124
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:32,920
Woo.

2125
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:36,020
Woo.

2126
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:44,150
It's hard to miss when you're this close.

2127
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:45,430
Yeah.

2128
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:50,430
It's kind of weird that you're using your sniper on me right here.

2129
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:51,470
Slowly.

2130
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:54,010
Something I would do.

2131
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:58,730
That wasn't slow.

2132
01:32:59,010 --> 01:32:59,230
Whoa.

2133
01:32:59,390 --> 01:33:00,370
The triple kick.

2134
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:03,750
You're a fool to come back here.

2135
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:05,770
Stupid man.

2136
01:33:07,230 --> 01:33:07,870
Sorry.

2137
01:33:07,910 --> 01:33:09,490
A lady sniper, huh?

2138
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:16,290
Don't you know that the majority of the world's great assassins are women?

2139
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:17,210
Yeah.

2140
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:19,330
Do you want to die now?

2141
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:22,090
Or after your female friend?

2142
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:23,790
Which will it be?

2143
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:24,690
Oh my god.

2144
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:27,510
I'll die after I kill you.

2145
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:35,170
What was that yell?

2146
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:37,670
You okay, Robin?

2147
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:38,570
Yeah.

2148
01:33:42,610 --> 01:33:44,930
Sometimes she even falls in love with him.

2149
01:33:50,370 --> 01:33:52,930
Snake's eyes here are like...

2150
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:56,370
His eyes are like bulging out of his head.

2151
01:34:00,150 --> 01:34:01,950
I've left my mark on you.

2152
01:34:02,130 --> 01:34:02,590
Oh my gosh.

2153
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:04,590
I won't forget it.

2154
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:06,750
Wow.

2155
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:11,210
Until I kill you, you're all I'll think about.

2156
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:14,370
Ooh la la.

2157
01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:17,990
What's your haircut?

2158
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:18,990
Ooh.

2159
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:21,910
Oh.

2160
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:24,150
Yeah, that was nothing.

2161
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:25,490
Little baby boy.

2162
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:28,150
Yeah, I'm like twice your size.

2163
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:28,870
Oh, never mind.

2164
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:29,670
It was everything.

2165
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:31,190
Take him away.

2166
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:33,790
What do you mean?

2167
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:34,950
Why did you do that?

2168
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:37,490
Don't kill him yet.

2169
01:34:38,030 --> 01:34:40,090
I won't kill you alive.

2170
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:42,970
Leave it to me.

2171
01:34:44,230 --> 01:34:47,950
I want no more accidents like that DARPA chief.

2172
01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:50,370
Like that DARPA chief.

2173
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:52,030
He's my target.

2174
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:53,650
Mine alone.

2175
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:54,950
It is Robin.

2176
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:55,910
I thought it was a bit.

2177
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:56,190
No!

2178
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:58,750
Also, hi Hana.

2179
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:01,290
On her mind, rent free.

2180
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:01,770
For real.

2181
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:02,250
For real.

2182
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:03,670
Yeah.

2183
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:06,290
Bro is lagging.

2184
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:10,370
Can you hear me, solid snake?

2185
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:11,590
Brother?

2186
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:15,650
Do you know who I am?

2187
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:20,510
I always knew that one day I would meet you.

2188
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:22,570
I like that we can just kind of see the tippy top of each other.

2189
01:35:22,570 --> 01:35:24,730
The man who stole the light from my life.

2190
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:26,410
Because of you!

2191
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:28,650
Forget it.

2192
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:30,690
Your body is strapped down tight.

2193
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:34,010
I salute.

2194
01:35:34,590 --> 01:35:38,510
I'm the man from whom you stole everything good.

2195
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:43,030
And now, after the sacrifice of our brothers.

2196
01:35:43,230 --> 01:35:45,230
After thirty long years.

2197
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:48,230
Finally, the two of us meet.

2198
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:52,770
The brother of light and the brother of dark.

2199
01:35:56,270 --> 01:35:57,550
Let me out of this.

2200
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:59,750
Do you need his genetic information too?

2201
01:36:00,090 --> 01:36:00,890
Yes.

2202
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:03,710
I want a sample while he's still alive.

2203
01:36:04,110 --> 01:36:07,290
We needed to correct the genome soldier's mutations.

2204
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:09,930
Then we'll be able to cure them?

2205
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:11,430
What's wrong with them?

2206
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:14,990
We still have to get our hands on Big Boss's DNA.

2207
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:16,470
They're only 179 IQ.

2208
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:21,210
Have they given in to our demands yet?

2209
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:23,010
Not yet.

2210
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:24,950
They won't give in.

2211
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:27,010
They're all hypocrites.

2212
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:28,870
Every one of them.

2213
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:30,510
Is that your opinion?

2214
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:30,870
Yes.

2215
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:31,590
As occurred.

2216
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:35,230
They always put politics first.

2217
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:37,330
And also, I'm not going to submit immediately.

2218
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:38,570
That's why they want to avoid any leak about their precious new nuclear weapon.

2219
01:36:38,570 --> 01:36:39,450
In case you guys are wondering as well.

2220
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:42,850
about their precious new nuclear weapon.

2221
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:45,930
Boss, it looks like our friend is awake.

2222
01:36:46,410 --> 01:36:47,570
Boss, it looks like our friend is awake.

2223
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:49,290
Who were you talking to before then?

2224
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:50,750
Were you not talking to me?

2225
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:54,590
Did you think I was asleep talking to me like that?

2226
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:56,750
Woah, why are we so red?

2227
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:57,290
Woah, why are we so red?

2228
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:04,610
There definitely is a resemblance.

2229
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:06,110
Don't you think?

2230
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:07,650
Little brother?

2231
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:10,030
Little brother?

2232
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,020
Oh my god.

2233
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:19,880
Woah, woah, woah.

2234
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:20,700
Woah, woah, woah.

2235
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:22,740
Or should I say big brother?

2236
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,660
I'm not sure.

2237
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:27,420
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

2238
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:29,700
You'd like us to be the little brother.

2239
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:30,580
You'd like us to be the little brother.

2240
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:32,900
You'd like us to be the little brother.

2241
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:34,820
What?

2242
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,060
Who's calling?

2243
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:39,060
It's me.

2244
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:39,700
Oh.

2245
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:41,000
Really?

2246
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:41,980
It's me.

2247
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:42,900
Then what?

2248
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,660
I'm the only British person here.

2249
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:45,960
Those idiots.

2250
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:48,260
There's a ninja on the loose.

2251
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:50,060
Alright, Raven.

2252
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:51,180
I'll be right there.

2253
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:54,740
Moshi moshi.

2254
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:56,520
They're not responding to our demands.

2255
01:37:57,060 --> 01:38:00,040
We'll launch the first one in ten hours as planned.

2256
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:00,800
Oh my god.

2257
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:01,620
No!

2258
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:06,040
Looks like you read them wrong.

2259
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:10,940
Don't point that thing at me, Ocelot.

2260
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:11,940
Something's funny.

2261
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:16,540
Normally the Americans are the first ones to the negotiating table.

2262
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:20,200
They must think they've got something up their sleeves.

2263
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:24,420
So it's come down to it, has it?

2264
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:28,340
We're gonna launch that nuke and write it all the way into history.

2265
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:28,780
Stop it.

2266
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:30,880
Oh, remember the Alamo, baby.

2267
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,740
I've got to take care of some launch preparations.

2268
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:34,920
You're in charge here, Ocelot.

2269
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:36,860
What about you?

2270
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,840
Wanna stay for the show?

2271
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:41,720
I'm not interested.

2272
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:45,560
Oh.

2273
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,340
Yeah.

2274
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,020
Take your meds.

2275
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:53,280
Oh, nice.

2276
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:54,060
Nice.

2277
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:57,620
Nice cinematography here.

2278
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:02,520
So, you prefer your wolves to my show, hm?

2279
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:03,320
Hm?

2280
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:07,320
Ocelot, don't screw up like you did with the chief.

2281
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:11,320
Yes, I know.

2282
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:12,980
That was an accident.

2283
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:18,040
I didn't think a pencil pusher like him would be so tough.

2284
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:24,340
Well, his mental defenses were reinforced by hypnotherapy.

2285
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:25,620
Gosh, they love hypnotherapy.

2286
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:29,140
Where can I get me some of that hypnotherapy?

2287
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:29,820
Boss, what about that ninja?

2288
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:32,180
That is regular therapy.

2289
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,540
He's killed twelve men.

2290
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:36,820
Whoever he is, he's some kind of lunatic.

2291
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:37,980
Twelve guys?

2292
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:39,740
Bastard took my hand.

2293
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,820
How could he have gotten in here?

2294
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:47,240
Perhaps there's a spy among us.

2295
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:48,540
Among us!

2296
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:49,880
Ho.

2297
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:51,440
No.

2298
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:53,660
Mantis is dead.

2299
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:57,340
We've also got to find out what killed Baker and Octopus.

2300
01:39:57,700 --> 01:39:58,960
We're short-handed.

2301
01:39:58,960 --> 01:39:59,380
Octopus?

2302
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:03,080
What do you mean?

2303
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:04,240
No, no, no.

2304
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,240
Decoy Octopus is still alive.

2305
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:07,140
We haven't fought him yet.

2306
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:08,740
This is an interrogation.

2307
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:12,920
Oh, my God.

2308
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,460
His nipples were long.

2309
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,680
See you later, brother.

2310
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:18,160
Brother?

2311
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:22,200
Oh, no.

2312
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:23,480
He's still alive.

2313
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:24,360
Decoy Octopus.

2314
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:25,300
We haven't seen him yet.

2315
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:32,110
She's so awesome.

2316
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:34,430
You know what?

2317
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:36,270
I get it.

2318
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:39,570
Oh, sorry.

2319
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:42,090
Your woman is still in this world.

2320
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:44,410
That was really close to comfort.

2321
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:45,730
Meryl.

2322
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,830
He's like...

2323
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:56,670
God, I wish that were...

2324
01:40:56,670 --> 01:40:57,530
What are you laughing at?

2325
01:40:57,710 --> 01:40:58,090
What?

2326
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:02,290
What?

2327
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:04,950
What?

2328
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:06,370
What?

2329
01:41:06,510 --> 01:41:07,650
What is all of this implying?

2330
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:08,990
What?

2331
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:16,630
Catch you later, Ansel.

2332
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:18,130
Woo!

2333
01:41:21,190 --> 01:41:22,910
Oh, he wanted a...

2334
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:23,990
He wanted a kiss.

2335
01:41:24,010 --> 01:41:25,150
He wanted like a little kiss on the cheek.

2336
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:28,150
When she picks a target, she doesn't think about anything else.

2337
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:33,830
Sometimes, she even falls in love with him before she kills them.

2338
01:41:33,830 --> 01:41:34,390
Wow.

2339
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:36,750
Finally.

2340
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:38,990
Just the two of us.

2341
01:41:39,170 --> 01:41:41,350
This bed is too big for just me.

2342
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:42,870
Us a lot.

2343
01:41:43,070 --> 01:41:43,870
How are you feeling?

2344
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:47,330
Not bad.

2345
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:50,310
Caught a nice nap on this revolving bed of yours.

2346
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:52,270
Too bad I was sleeping alone.

2347
01:41:52,490 --> 01:41:52,870
Yeah!

2348
01:41:53,930 --> 01:41:55,170
Glad to hear that.

2349
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:57,310
This is some bed alright.

2350
01:41:58,670 --> 01:42:01,870
I'm about to show you some of its nicer features.

2351
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:02,990
Woo!

2352
01:42:03,890 --> 01:42:05,150
Where are my things?

2353
01:42:05,490 --> 01:42:06,670
Where are my things?

2354
01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:07,550
Oh, don't worry.

2355
01:42:07,970 --> 01:42:09,030
They're all there.

2356
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:10,670
In the floating...

2357
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:12,650
Oh, it's actually just a normal box.

2358
01:42:13,410 --> 01:42:14,270
That's so funny.

2359
01:42:14,570 --> 01:42:16,330
It's not like floating like in the original.

2360
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:18,890
Washington was taking quite a chance sending you here.

2361
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:22,230
Someone must have a lot of faith in your skill.

2362
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:23,550
Carrier boy!

2363
01:42:25,630 --> 01:42:26,110
Huh?

2364
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:31,710
So, Metal Gear is armed with a new type of nuclear warhead, huh?

2365
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:32,090
Huh?

2366
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:34,430
What does that cat mean?

2367
01:42:34,830 --> 01:42:35,230
Huh?

2368
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:38,830
What do you mean?

2369
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:40,130
What do you mean by that?

2370
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:45,090
By the way, you got an optical disc from President Baker, didn't you?

2371
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:47,290
What if I did?

2372
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:47,750
Oh my god.

2373
01:42:47,950 --> 01:42:49,830
Can you show, like, at least a little bit of his pants?

2374
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:50,350
Is that the only disc?

2375
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:51,870
There's no other data.

2376
01:42:52,670 --> 01:42:53,530
What do you mean?

2377
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:56,170
There's no copy?

2378
01:42:56,990 --> 01:42:58,710
If not, that's fine.

2379
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:01,990
I love the kind of woman that will actually just kill me.

2380
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:04,570
So true.

2381
01:43:06,530 --> 01:43:07,210
Is Meryl okay?

2382
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:09,070
Yeah.

2383
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:10,350
She's not dead.

2384
01:43:10,670 --> 01:43:11,190
Yet.

2385
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:13,150
Thanks to Wolf's whim.

2386
01:43:13,550 --> 01:43:16,210
But it's up to you if you want her to stay that way.

2387
01:43:16,510 --> 01:43:17,030
Uh huh.

2388
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:19,250
You were holding one card key.

2389
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:20,930
Where are the other two?

2390
01:43:21,150 --> 01:43:22,850
What's the trick behind that key?

2391
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:24,350
What's the trick behind the key?

2392
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:30,070
That weasel of a president said there's some kind of trick in using the key.

2393
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:30,950
Yeah.

2394
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:33,190
Hell of a...

2395
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:37,230
You want hypnotherapy?

2396
01:43:37,290 --> 01:43:39,830
Just stare into the suspicious app that appeared on my phone.

2397
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:40,810
What does that mean?

2398
01:43:42,710 --> 01:43:43,190
Oh!

2399
01:43:43,190 --> 01:43:43,670
No!

2400
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:45,790
He's not...

2401
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:47,890
You're going to play a game, Solid Snake.

2402
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:49,430
He's not a revolver.

2403
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:51,470
And we'll find out what kind of man you really are.

2404
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:51,930
Enough!

2405
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:54,630
He can't revolve!

2406
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:57,030
Just give up and your suffering will end.

2407
01:43:57,570 --> 01:44:01,210
But if you do, the girl's life is mine.

2408
01:44:03,630 --> 01:44:04,590
But if you do, the girl's life is mine.

2409
01:44:04,590 --> 01:44:04,690
Okay.

2410
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:08,970
They nerfed him.

2411
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:14,730
Press the resist button repeatedly to regain your strength.

2412
01:44:14,830 --> 01:44:15,310
Wait, what's the resist button?

2413
01:44:15,690 --> 01:44:19,250
When you've had enough, press the surrender button to submit.

2414
01:44:19,390 --> 01:44:20,570
Wait, wait, wait, Ocelot, what's the...

2415
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:23,110
When your life reaches zero, the game is over.

2416
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:23,670
Okay.

2417
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:25,070
Should have saved.

2418
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:26,630
There are no continues, my friend.

2419
01:44:26,790 --> 01:44:27,690
Oh gosh, I should have saved.

2420
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:31,270
Don't even think about using auto fire, or I'll know.

2421
01:44:31,270 --> 01:44:33,010
Oh, he's looking at me!

2422
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:36,690
It's been a long time since you saved your game.

2423
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:38,310
Yeah?

2424
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:39,190
So what?

2425
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:43,950
If your body can't survive the torture, it'll be game over.

2426
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:45,250
He even knows.

2427
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:47,690
You really want to travel down that long road again?

2428
01:44:47,970 --> 01:44:48,570
Wait, he knows.

2429
01:44:48,910 --> 01:44:50,790
Come on, I won't tell.

2430
01:44:51,250 --> 01:44:52,750
Why don't you just give up?

2431
01:44:52,770 --> 01:44:53,010
What?

2432
01:44:53,730 --> 01:44:57,390
I'm going to run a high voltage electric current through your body.

2433
01:44:58,530 --> 01:45:00,870
If it's just for a short time, it won't kill you.

2434
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:01,250
Wait, what is this?

2435
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:01,950
Oh, it's the resist button.

2436
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:06,370
Did you know that it was the French who first thought of using electrical shocks as a means of torture?

2437
01:45:06,370 --> 01:45:07,930
Of course it was the French.

2438
01:45:09,070 --> 01:45:11,090
Hey, French films are all right.

2439
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:12,810
But I don't care about that crap.

2440
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:15,550
You're a tough guy, Snake.

2441
01:45:15,670 --> 01:45:16,750
What does that have to do with anything, Snake?

2442
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:17,950
But I've got some bad news for you.

2443
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:19,330
You're no POW.

2444
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:21,050
I'm surprised you didn't talk about French fries.

2445
01:45:21,110 --> 01:45:21,730
You're a hostage.

2446
01:45:22,230 --> 01:45:23,590
There's no Geneva Convention.

2447
01:45:24,270 --> 01:45:26,070
No one is coming to save you.

2448
01:45:26,770 --> 01:45:28,350
Starting to feel a little scared?

2449
01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:29,350
Nah.

2450
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:30,190
Oh.

2451
01:45:31,270 --> 01:45:31,530
Yes.

2452
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:33,730
Okay.

2453
01:45:33,730 --> 01:45:34,810
Let's get started.

2454
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:35,970
What is the resist key?

2455
01:45:36,350 --> 01:45:36,910
Wait.

2456
01:45:37,210 --> 01:45:39,210
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2457
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:45,270
Oh, we're getting straight.

2458
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:52,060
Oh, that was...

2459
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:53,720
so fast.

2460
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:55,200
Shall we go again?

2461
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:56,400
That was so fast.

2462
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:57,360
Okay.

2463
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:04,250
Nice.

2464
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:06,110
Had enough yet?

2465
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:07,870
He's not, like, screaming the whole time.

2466
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:09,610
Oh, I'm not finished yet.

2467
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:12,190
It's so easy.

2468
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:18,690
It's so fast.

2469
01:46:20,710 --> 01:46:22,790
Oh, it's all Snake around your dad.

2470
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:24,130
Don't say that.

2471
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:27,370
Even if it's true.

2472
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:30,190
You're a strong man.

2473
01:46:30,730 --> 01:46:31,430
I know.

2474
01:46:31,870 --> 01:46:34,010
Just like my father, right?

2475
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:39,430
You're the boss's brother, all right.

2476
01:46:40,530 --> 01:46:41,570
Your brother.

2477
01:46:42,370 --> 01:46:43,890
He's an amazing man.

2478
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:47,770
Who else could shoot down two F-16s with a chopper?

2479
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:48,470
Oh, my God.

2480
01:46:48,490 --> 01:46:48,950
The eyebrow.

2481
01:46:49,190 --> 01:46:51,270
The Les Enfants Terribles project was not a total failure.

2482
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:52,490
Les Enfants Terribles project.

2483
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:57,870
He is the one man who could make my dream into a reality.

2484
01:46:58,390 --> 01:46:59,850
What is that project?

2485
01:47:00,530 --> 01:47:01,050
Oh.

2486
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:05,430
Take me home, Robin.

2487
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:12,610
Oh.

2488
01:47:12,650 --> 01:47:21,730
I like how at the start of every, like, change in angle or, like, the cutscenes, like, their hair all, like, kind of resets.

2489
01:47:21,730 --> 01:47:22,290
It's so funny.

2490
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:24,170
Johnny!

2491
01:47:25,850 --> 01:47:26,350
Where?

2492
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:33,090
Looks like I got a roommate.

2493
01:47:34,990 --> 01:47:35,950
Looks like I got a roommate.

2494
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:36,530
Looks so good.

2495
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:42,700
Decoy Octopus.

2496
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:46,800
Decoy Octopus.

2497
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:51,820
Oh, my God!

2498
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:53,820
That's disgust...

2499
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:54,020
Ew!

2500
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:55,120
Oh, my God.

2501
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:56,740
Wait, that is actually disgusting.

2502
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:59,140
Oh, gross!

2503
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,320
What a stench.

2504
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:03,760
You couldn't tell when you first came in?

2505
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:07,700
That is some severe...

2506
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:08,220
Ew.

2507
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:10,620
Lord.

2508
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:12,520
Ding.

2509
01:48:15,710 --> 01:48:17,470
Snake, are you okay?

2510
01:48:17,770 --> 01:48:19,030
I've been better.

2511
01:48:19,390 --> 01:48:20,330
How's Meryl?

2512
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:21,810
They got her.

2513
01:48:22,230 --> 01:48:22,790
Damn.

2514
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:24,030
Colonel.

2515
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:25,450
Okay.

2516
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:26,730
I know.

2517
01:48:28,110 --> 01:48:31,750
Snake, the government has decided not to give in to their demands.

2518
01:48:32,150 --> 01:48:33,890
We're trying to buy some more time.

2519
01:48:34,190 --> 01:48:35,210
Come on, Colonel.

2520
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:37,230
Why don't you stop playing dumb?

2521
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:40,730
I'm sorry about Meryl, but I want the lies to end now.

2522
01:48:40,990 --> 01:48:41,310
Now!

2523
01:48:41,330 --> 01:48:42,170
What are you talking about?

2524
01:48:44,590 --> 01:48:46,070
You were the type of nuclear warhead, wasn't it?

2525
01:48:46,870 --> 01:48:47,350
No.

2526
01:48:47,830 --> 01:48:49,690
You knew it all along, didn't you?

2527
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:50,210
No.

2528
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:53,310
Why did you try to hide it?

2529
01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:53,990
Colonel!

2530
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:54,890
I'm sorry.

2531
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:57,310
Can't tell the grunts, huh?

2532
01:48:58,090 --> 01:48:59,410
You've changed a lot.

2533
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:01,070
Metal gear.

2534
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:03,530
Secret advanced nuclear weapons research.

2535
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:05,730
Does the White House know about this?

2536
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:06,570
Of course it does.

2537
01:49:06,570 --> 01:49:07,210
How deep does it go?

2538
01:49:07,290 --> 01:49:08,150
Of course they do.

2539
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:13,110
As far as I know, as of yesterday, the President had not been briefed about the Rex Project.

2540
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:13,790
Lies!

2541
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:14,910
No basis.

2542
01:49:15,370 --> 01:49:16,370
Is that the idea?

2543
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:18,270
These are sensitive times.

2544
01:49:18,710 --> 01:49:21,970
Even sub-critical nuclear tests are causing quite a stir.

2545
01:49:22,490 --> 01:49:24,270
Plausible deniability, huh?

2546
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:25,110
Yes.

2547
01:49:25,550 --> 01:49:31,230
And tomorrow, the President and his Russian counterpart are scheduled to sign the START III accord.

2548
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:32,510
I get it.

2549
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:34,250
That's the reason for the deadline.

2550
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:35,730
That's right, Snake.

2551
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:39,070
And that's why we can't let this terrorist attack go public.

2552
01:49:39,590 --> 01:49:41,890
We still haven't even ratified START II.

2553
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:44,010
Or dealt with the issue of TMDs.

2554
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:45,850
This is ridiculous.

2555
01:49:45,850 --> 01:49:47,190
This has to do with the President's reputation.

2556
01:49:47,670 --> 01:49:50,810
I don't care about the President's reputation.

2557
01:49:51,230 --> 01:49:51,990
I don't care about the President's reputation.

2558
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:55,030
I don't care about the President's reputation.

2559
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:57,210
Please, Snake, just stop them.

2560
01:49:57,370 --> 01:49:58,830
To serve your interests?

2561
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:01,750
Because we're relying on you.

2562
01:50:02,210 --> 01:50:04,550
I like this picture because Snake looks so mad.

2563
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:05,050
I like this picture because Snake looks so mad.

2564
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:08,070
I told you before.

2565
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:10,130
I don't know the details.

2566
01:50:10,130 --> 01:50:11,750
I don't believe you.

2567
01:50:11,850 --> 01:50:14,010
Yeah, I don't believe you either, Colonel.

2568
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:17,870
If the situation is so serious, why don't you give in to their demands?

2569
01:50:18,170 --> 01:50:19,870
Let them have Big Boss's remains.

2570
01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:20,650
Yeah, who cares?

2571
01:50:21,030 --> 01:50:23,450
Or is there some reason that you can't do that?

2572
01:50:23,930 --> 01:50:25,570
Something you haven't told me about.

2573
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:25,870
No.

2574
01:50:26,010 --> 01:50:30,090
The President has adopted a firm public stance vis-à-vis bioethics.

2575
01:50:30,170 --> 01:50:30,670
Vis-à-vis?

2576
01:50:30,710 --> 01:50:33,850
We don't want the existence of the Genome Army to go public.

2577
01:50:34,330 --> 01:50:37,110
You're just all covering your butts.

2578
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:39,190
For your mistake.

2579
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:39,530
Yeah.

2580
01:50:40,130 --> 01:50:40,930
What the hell with you?

2581
01:50:41,130 --> 01:50:41,330
I'm sorry.

2582
01:50:42,030 --> 01:50:45,490
The corpse of the DARPA chief is lying right here next to me.

2583
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:46,890
Poor man.

2584
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:48,910
But it's strange.

2585
01:50:49,530 --> 01:50:52,890
He looks and smells like he's been dead for days.

2586
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:55,390
All his blood's been drained out too.

2587
01:50:55,830 --> 01:50:56,350
Drained?

2588
01:50:56,730 --> 01:50:58,190
Maybe to slow down decomposition?

2589
01:50:58,830 --> 01:50:59,870
I have no idea.

2590
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:02,690
But the chief only died a few hours ago, right?

2591
01:51:02,930 --> 01:51:03,290
Right.

2592
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:05,990
But he's already started to decompose.

2593
01:51:06,130 --> 01:51:07,490
What could it all be about?

2594
01:51:10,130 --> 01:51:10,370
I doubt it.

2595
01:51:10,450 --> 01:51:12,370
Just the nanomachines and the transmitter.

2596
01:51:12,690 --> 01:51:15,010
Did the chief tell them his detonation code?

2597
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:16,430
I'm afraid so.

2598
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:16,910
Yeah.

2599
01:51:17,110 --> 01:51:20,150
It looks like they've got both codes and are nearly ready to launch.

2600
01:51:20,150 --> 01:51:20,550
Damn.

2601
01:51:20,550 --> 01:51:23,530
Is there any way to prevent it?

2602
01:51:23,730 --> 01:51:28,870
It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can cancel out the detonation code.

2603
01:51:29,110 --> 01:51:29,250
Yeah.

2604
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:31,950
It's a countermeasure that ArmsTech installed secretly.

2605
01:51:32,370 --> 01:51:34,970
You have to unlock it with three special card keys.

2606
01:51:35,110 --> 01:51:35,710
But we only have one.

2607
01:51:35,810 --> 01:51:36,770
And where are those keys?

2608
01:51:36,770 --> 01:51:37,690
We only have the one.

2609
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:38,490
I've got one of them.

2610
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:40,230
I don't know where the other two are.

2611
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:42,770
Besides, I'm locked up here.

2612
01:51:43,290 --> 01:51:44,490
We've got no choice.

2613
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:45,990
Forget about the keys.

2614
01:51:46,310 --> 01:51:49,830
Your top priority now is to destroy Metal Gear itself.

2615
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:52,610
I'm sorry to have to lay it all in your lap.

2616
01:51:52,890 --> 01:51:54,010
But you're all I've got.

2617
01:51:54,710 --> 01:51:55,650
Bust out of there.

2618
01:51:55,790 --> 01:51:57,550
And get to the communications tower.

2619
01:51:58,090 --> 01:51:59,310
I'm busting all right.

2620
01:51:59,570 --> 01:51:59,850
What?

2621
01:52:01,870 --> 01:52:02,510
Meryl, right?

2622
01:52:02,510 --> 01:52:03,410
Yeah.

2623
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:05,570
I'll save her.

2624
01:52:06,530 --> 01:52:07,050
Thanks.

2625
01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:09,230
I won't do that.

2626
01:52:09,330 --> 01:52:10,730
I won't do that.

2627
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:20,360
God damn.

2628
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:21,580
I caught a cold.

2629
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:23,760
That witch.

2630
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:25,300
She took my clothes.

2631
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:26,540
Hey.

2632
01:52:26,980 --> 01:52:28,400
Shut up in there, will ya?

2633
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:32,100
Shut up in there, will ya?

2634
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:35,420
Hey.

2635
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:37,860
Hey.

2636
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:40,040
Shut up in there, will ya?

2637
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:42,340
Hey.

2638
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:43,820
Hey.

2639
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:45,880
Hey.

2640
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:46,400
Hey.

2641
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:46,880
Hey.

2642
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:47,320
Hey.

2643
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:49,580
Shut up in there, will ya?

2644
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:55,580
I don't think I can call Otacon.

2645
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:57,240
I don't know if I can call him that.

2646
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:57,980
Hey.

2647
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,640
Are you okay, Otacon?

2648
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,740
Thanks to the stealth camouflage, that is.

2649
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:04,120
Yeah, I could have used that.

2650
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:05,320
Why don't you just...

2651
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:10,020
Why don't you just hide in a locker and I use the stealth camo?

2652
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:10,560
Why don't you just hide in a locker and I use the stealth camo?

2653
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:11,880
I'm locked up here in this cell.

2654
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:12,700
What cell?

2655
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:15,400
There's a big torture machine nearby.

2656
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:17,100
Okay, I know it.

2657
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:18,000
It's close.

2658
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:19,340
I'll be there right away.

2659
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:20,120
Thanks.

2660
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:23,100
Let's save also.

2661
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:25,260
Melee!

2662
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:28,200
Snake, are you okay?

2663
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:30,260
I feel so scared for you.

2664
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:31,440
It must be horrible.

2665
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:32,580
I'm so scared, Melee.

2666
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:34,340
I've been through a lot worse.

2667
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:35,640
Believe me.

2668
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:36,360
He's so cool.

2669
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:41,580
It's a good thing the codec is connected directly to your inner ear.

2670
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:42,300
It's a good thing the codec is connected directly to your inner ear.

2671
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:43,380
You can contact us anytime.

2672
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:45,880
It's always nice to hear that you're alright.

2673
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:48,280
Why don't you contact the Colonel?

2674
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:50,400
If anyone can think of a way out, it's him.

2675
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:51,900
Contact the Colonel.

2676
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:55,100
Okay, let's see.

2677
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:56,620
Okay, let's see.

2678
01:53:59,400 --> 01:53:59,840
Okay.

2679
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:01,960
When do I get my ketchup?

2680
01:54:02,780 --> 01:54:04,100
Please, Snake, don't give up.

2681
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:05,820
I won't for you, baby girl.

2682
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:08,300
I wonder actually if I call him.

2683
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:15,880
Normally, when a soldier is taken prisoner, he should only give up the big four.

2684
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:17,140
Thank you for the raid!

2685
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:19,880
Serial number and date of birth.

2686
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:22,540
But you're not any old soldier, Snake.

2687
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:23,000
I'm not.

2688
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:23,720
I'm a gamer.

2689
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,260
I don't want you to tell them anything.

2690
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:25,720
Oh, yeah.

2691
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,440
You're strong enough to resist.

2692
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:31,100
Yeah, I won't tell them anything, Master.

2693
01:54:37,790 --> 01:54:39,330
The guard is only human.

2694
01:54:39,610 --> 01:54:42,550
He has to sleep and go to the bathroom like the rest of us.

2695
01:54:42,810 --> 01:54:43,850
That'll be your chance.

2696
01:54:47,310 --> 01:54:48,330
That's so true.

2697
01:54:48,870 --> 01:54:49,890
That's so true.

2698
01:54:50,830 --> 01:54:51,850
Hey there, Johnny.

2699
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:55,390
Thanks for the gift, Ducky.

2700
01:54:56,990 --> 01:54:58,190
Look at him looking at me.

2701
01:54:58,510 --> 01:54:59,690
Looking at him looking at me.

2702
01:55:00,490 --> 01:55:00,630
Oh!

2703
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:04,370
Cover your nose when you do that.

2704
01:55:05,850 --> 01:55:07,610
This guy has no hygiene.

2705
01:55:09,030 --> 01:55:10,410
Oh, my God.

2706
01:55:10,850 --> 01:55:12,490
Go wash your hands, Johnny.

2707
01:55:21,930 --> 01:55:23,130
He's checking me out.

2708
01:55:23,730 --> 01:55:25,890
Oh, what just opened?

2709
01:55:27,730 --> 01:55:29,010
Shut up in there, will ya?

2710
01:55:29,110 --> 01:55:29,810
I won't.

2711
01:55:30,490 --> 01:55:30,810
Let me...

2712
01:55:32,330 --> 01:55:33,530
Shut up in there, will ya?

2713
01:55:34,410 --> 01:55:34,870
What's that?

2714
01:55:35,650 --> 01:55:37,050
Snake, it's showtime.

2715
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:38,870
Ocelot wants you.

2716
01:55:39,150 --> 01:55:41,230
Oh, I know he does.

2717
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:44,350
Yeah, there's snot all in that mask.

2718
01:55:44,450 --> 01:55:44,930
Can you imagine?

2719
01:55:46,570 --> 01:55:47,450
Tascaru sneezed.

2720
01:55:47,450 --> 01:55:48,190
Johnny, 11 years.

2721
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:55,510
I want to do the catch up, so that's why I'm going to keep resisting.

2722
01:55:55,770 --> 01:55:55,990
Wait.

2723
01:55:55,990 --> 01:55:57,730
You repeated me to regain your strength.

2724
01:55:57,890 --> 01:55:58,130
Oh, no.

2725
01:55:58,150 --> 01:55:59,370
I have to give up, though, don't I?

2726
01:55:59,510 --> 01:56:02,550
When you've had enough, press the surrender button to submit.

2727
01:56:03,770 --> 01:56:04,290
I have to surrender.

2728
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:06,510
When your life reaches zero, the game is over.

2729
01:56:06,510 --> 01:56:07,890
I have to surrender, don't I?

2730
01:56:08,350 --> 01:56:10,870
There are no continues, my friend.

2731
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:11,530
I know.

2732
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:14,010
I fought wars in Afghanistan.

2733
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:15,130
Ketchup means escape.

2734
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:16,110
Yeah, exactly.

2735
01:56:16,370 --> 01:56:17,790
Mozambique, Eritrea, and Chad.

2736
01:56:18,410 --> 01:56:18,930
Chad?

2737
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:21,770
Among the Mujahideen guerrillas.

2738
01:56:22,070 --> 01:56:24,150
I was known and feared as...

2739
01:56:24,150 --> 01:56:25,210
Shalashaska.

2740
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:28,770
I was trained by the Russian groom.

2741
01:56:28,910 --> 01:56:31,270
Okay, I don't need your biography to also lie.

2742
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:33,470
I'm not like one of those KGB slugs.

2743
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:34,110
Shalashaska.

2744
01:56:34,330 --> 01:56:35,350
To me, this isn't torture.

2745
01:56:36,070 --> 01:56:37,130
It's a sport.

2746
01:56:37,150 --> 01:56:38,230
It's a fetish.

2747
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:41,210
You're all just a bunch of sadists.

2748
01:56:41,710 --> 01:56:42,630
Yeah, he is.

2749
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:45,590
Don't confuse me with those uniformed fools.

2750
01:56:48,030 --> 01:56:48,570
Shalashaska.

2751
01:56:48,730 --> 01:56:50,590
Lookit, his nipples are kind of long, though, right?

2752
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:51,990
Shall we begin?

2753
01:56:54,150 --> 01:56:55,190
I have to submit, though, don't I?

2754
01:56:56,850 --> 01:56:57,290
Mmm...

2755
01:56:57,290 --> 01:56:59,050
Do we want to go through one more time?

2756
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:02,790
What should I do?

2757
01:57:05,150 --> 01:57:05,870
Oh my gosh.

2758
01:57:05,910 --> 01:57:06,630
It's so easy.

2759
01:57:08,490 --> 01:57:08,930
Submit.

2760
01:57:09,870 --> 01:57:11,610
You can go through two sessions.

2761
01:57:13,770 --> 01:57:14,650
No, guys.

2762
01:57:18,590 --> 01:57:21,190
You're really going to want to see the Otacon ending.

2763
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:21,690
I promise.

2764
01:57:22,870 --> 01:57:23,310
Okay.

2765
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:26,930
There's three sessions total.

2766
01:57:27,210 --> 01:57:27,370
Okay.

2767
01:57:30,770 --> 01:57:32,090
I just kind of want to like...

2768
01:57:34,150 --> 01:57:35,670
I kind of want to just like...

2769
01:57:38,170 --> 01:57:39,750
Hang out with Johnny one more time.

2770
01:57:40,810 --> 01:57:42,310
You're a strong man.

2771
01:57:42,970 --> 01:57:43,670
Yeah, I am.

2772
01:57:43,790 --> 01:57:46,070
Well, that's enough for now, I think.

2773
01:57:46,090 --> 01:57:46,710
For now.

2774
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:49,730
I feel like a loser submitting.

2775
01:57:49,890 --> 01:57:50,650
Even though it's...

2776
01:57:51,610 --> 01:57:52,230
You know?

2777
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:53,570
Imperialism.

2778
01:57:55,250 --> 01:57:55,810
Totalitarianism.

2779
01:57:56,930 --> 01:57:57,490
Perestroika.

2780
01:57:57,730 --> 01:57:58,190
Did you save?

2781
01:57:58,290 --> 01:57:58,610
I did save.

2782
01:57:58,610 --> 01:57:58,930
Yep.

2783
01:57:58,970 --> 01:58:01,030
20th century Russia has had its share of problems.

2784
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:02,910
But at least they had an ideology.

2785
01:58:03,830 --> 01:58:05,830
Russia today has nothing.

2786
01:58:06,110 --> 01:58:06,930
Jan, I'm sleepy.

2787
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:09,610
They're struggling between freedom and order.

2788
01:58:09,790 --> 01:58:13,250
And with that struggle, a new spirit of nationalism has been born.

2789
01:58:13,670 --> 01:58:14,610
And with that struggle, a new spirit of nationalism has been born.

2790
01:58:14,610 --> 01:58:17,510
The boss has a close friend high up in the Russian government.

2791
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:18,090
The boss has a close friend high up in the Russian government.

2792
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:20,650
He's currently the head of Spetsnaz.

2793
01:58:21,650 --> 01:58:22,210
Spetsnaz.

2794
01:58:22,230 --> 01:58:25,470
He's agreed to purchase this new nuclear weapons system.

2795
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:27,930
The hind was just a down payment.

2796
01:58:28,330 --> 01:58:30,090
Oh, this is Gurlukovich?

2797
01:58:30,410 --> 01:58:31,590
You're in this for the money?

2798
01:58:31,770 --> 01:58:32,250
No.

2799
01:58:32,510 --> 01:58:34,030
I don't need money.

2800
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:35,350
Oh, no, Snake.

2801
01:58:35,450 --> 01:58:36,550
I want Russia to be reborn.

2802
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:38,630
To lead a brave new world order.

2803
01:58:38,630 --> 01:58:39,170
Oh, no, Snake.

2804
01:58:39,190 --> 01:58:40,570
If only you knew what he's...

2805
01:58:40,570 --> 01:58:43,150
What Ocelot is in it for?

2806
01:58:43,330 --> 01:58:44,750
If only you knew.

2807
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:46,570
Yeah, Olga's dad?

2808
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:47,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2809
01:58:47,530 --> 01:58:48,730
Colonel Gurlukovich.

2810
01:58:48,730 --> 01:58:48,830
Colonel Gurlukovich.

2811
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:51,810
Watch.

2812
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:54,190
He loves to watch me be dragged away.

2813
01:58:58,410 --> 01:59:01,210
He loves to watch me get dragged away.

2814
01:59:01,710 --> 01:59:01,790
He loves to watch me get dragged away.

2815
01:59:02,030 --> 01:59:02,790
I'm back.

2816
01:59:04,050 --> 01:59:05,410
I'm back, my girlfriend.

2817
01:59:06,950 --> 01:59:08,270
What if I hide under here?

2818
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:09,750
I think he, like, kind of...

2819
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:10,510
He's like...

2820
01:59:11,530 --> 01:59:12,830
He's calling me.

2821
01:59:14,730 --> 01:59:15,350
I'm good.

2822
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:15,430
I'm dead.

2823
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:17,550
Nothing new to report.

2824
01:59:18,730 --> 01:59:20,090
Snake, is there anything I can do?

2825
01:59:20,090 --> 01:59:20,750
Oh, my God, Raffle Chief!

2826
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:22,150
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

2827
01:59:22,190 --> 01:59:22,790
Thank you!

2828
01:59:23,610 --> 01:59:25,130
Oh, I guess I should have...

2829
01:59:25,130 --> 01:59:27,510
I increased the level of painkillers in your blood.

2830
01:59:27,510 --> 01:59:27,790
To the raiders.

2831
01:59:27,910 --> 01:59:29,210
Hi, I'm Mint Phantom.

2832
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:30,650
I'm a ghost maid.

2833
01:59:30,990 --> 01:59:31,430
Please talk to me.

2834
01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:33,670
Say something to take my mind off the pain.

2835
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:35,430
What can I say?

2836
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:36,430
I love Metal Gear Solid.

2837
01:59:36,630 --> 01:59:36,870
Anything.

2838
01:59:36,970 --> 01:59:37,430
Too much.

2839
01:59:37,670 --> 01:59:40,830
I'm not a very good talker.

2840
01:59:40,830 --> 01:59:41,330
Please.

2841
01:59:42,350 --> 01:59:43,550
Tell me about yourself.

2842
01:59:45,330 --> 01:59:45,790
Myself?

2843
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:47,350
That's a tough one.

2844
01:59:47,550 --> 01:59:48,390
Any family?

2845
01:59:48,950 --> 01:59:50,690
That's not a happy topic for me.

2846
01:59:51,750 --> 01:59:53,130
I don't have any family.

2847
01:59:54,010 --> 01:59:54,650
No, wait.

2848
01:59:55,290 --> 01:59:57,830
There was a man who said he was my father.

2849
01:59:58,590 --> 01:59:59,390
Where is he?

2850
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:00,570
Dead.

2851
02:00:01,230 --> 02:00:02,350
By my own hand.

2852
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:03,870
Big Boss.

2853
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:05,930
What?

2854
02:00:05,930 --> 02:00:06,730
Big Boss?

2855
02:00:07,470 --> 02:00:08,990
There was no way you could know.

2856
02:00:08,990 --> 02:00:12,010
It happened in Zanzibar Land six years ago.

2857
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:15,710
Only Snake and I know the real truth of what happened there.

2858
02:00:16,270 --> 02:00:17,650
So, is it true?

2859
02:00:18,730 --> 02:00:20,610
Was Big Boss really your father?

2860
02:00:21,310 --> 02:00:22,350
That's what he said.

2861
02:00:23,130 --> 02:00:24,210
That's all I know.

2862
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:27,510
And you were able to kill him knowing that?

2863
02:00:28,010 --> 02:00:28,570
Yep.

2864
02:00:29,130 --> 02:00:29,690
How?

2865
02:00:29,990 --> 02:00:31,230
It's what we wanted.

2866
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:32,330
Me.

2867
02:00:33,210 --> 02:00:34,110
And him.

2868
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:35,790
That's patricide.

2869
02:00:35,890 --> 02:00:36,250
Yeah.

2870
02:00:36,290 --> 02:00:37,210
After Zanzibar.

2871
02:00:38,990 --> 02:00:39,570
He was the king of my life.

2872
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:41,930
Just like Mantis said.

2873
02:00:42,130 --> 02:00:43,990
Is that why you left Foxhound?

2874
02:00:44,590 --> 02:00:47,270
Let's just say that I needed to be alone for a while.

2875
02:00:47,510 --> 02:00:49,490
And Alaska was the perfect place.

2876
02:00:49,650 --> 02:00:50,650
And your fifty dogs.

2877
02:00:51,170 --> 02:00:51,610
Snake.

2878
02:00:52,630 --> 02:00:53,970
Yeah, I'm troubled too, Naomi.

2879
02:00:54,450 --> 02:00:56,390
We all have our problems, Naomi.

2880
02:00:56,570 --> 02:00:57,730
Just a big brother who put me through school.

2881
02:00:58,630 --> 02:01:00,930
We weren't even blood related and he was much older than me.

2882
02:01:00,930 --> 02:01:02,090
Thank you, Minty, for fixing the soundtrack.

2883
02:01:02,350 --> 02:01:02,650
I got you.

2884
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:02,950
Where is he?

2885
02:01:03,710 --> 02:01:04,390
He's dead.

2886
02:01:05,010 --> 02:01:05,730
I'm sorry.

2887
02:01:06,630 --> 02:01:07,870
His name was...

2888
02:01:08,990 --> 02:01:09,170
Hunter.

2889
02:01:09,170 --> 02:01:10,010
Is there a woman in your life?

2890
02:01:10,030 --> 02:01:10,870
I'm sorry, Frank Yeager.

2891
02:01:11,090 --> 02:01:15,070
After you've been through as many wars as me, it's hard to trust anyone.

2892
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:16,410
Friends?

2893
02:01:16,970 --> 02:01:17,730
Roy Campbell.

2894
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:21,210
You're still calling me friend?

2895
02:01:21,890 --> 02:01:22,750
Is that it?

2896
02:01:22,850 --> 02:01:26,210
Sorry, I love that part because Campbell's actually so cute there.

2897
02:01:26,410 --> 02:01:27,190
Frank Yeager.

2898
02:01:28,790 --> 02:01:30,750
Big Boss' most trusted lieutenant.

2899
02:01:31,190 --> 02:01:34,850
And the only member of Foxhound ever to receive the code name Fox.

2900
02:01:35,790 --> 02:01:36,630
Gray Fox.

2901
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:40,930
I learned a lot from him.

2902
02:01:42,630 --> 02:01:44,630
But... didn't you try to kill each other?

2903
02:01:45,270 --> 02:01:45,910
It's true.

2904
02:01:46,310 --> 02:01:47,030
We did.

2905
02:01:47,470 --> 02:01:48,750
In Zanzibar land.

2906
02:01:49,490 --> 02:01:50,810
But it was nothing personal.

2907
02:01:50,970 --> 02:01:53,230
We were just professionals on opposite sides.

2908
02:01:53,310 --> 02:01:53,870
That's all.

2909
02:01:54,130 --> 02:01:56,310
And you still call yourself friends?

2910
02:01:56,830 --> 02:01:57,690
Hard to believe.

2911
02:01:58,350 --> 02:02:00,430
War is no reason to end a friendship.

2912
02:02:00,890 --> 02:02:01,710
That's insane.

2913
02:02:02,490 --> 02:02:04,170
I first met him on the battlefield.

2914
02:02:05,270 --> 02:02:06,610
He was being held apart.

2915
02:02:06,630 --> 02:02:07,610
He was a prisoner of outer heaven.

2916
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:10,170
But he didn't look like a prisoner to me.

2917
02:02:11,050 --> 02:02:13,990
He was always so cool and precise.

2918
02:02:14,350 --> 02:02:15,070
He's so cool.

2919
02:02:15,070 --> 02:02:15,830
I was still green.

2920
02:02:16,090 --> 02:02:17,490
And he showed me the ropes.

2921
02:02:17,810 --> 02:02:18,850
You knew him well?

2922
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:22,130
We never talked about our personal lives.

2923
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:24,210
Sort of an unwritten rule.

2924
02:02:25,130 --> 02:02:27,090
The next time I saw him on the battlefield.

2925
02:02:28,030 --> 02:02:28,930
We were enemies.

2926
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:32,130
We were fighting barehanded in a minefield.

2927
02:02:32,290 --> 02:02:33,410
Yeah, it was so awesome.

2928
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:34,130
I punched him.

2929
02:02:36,630 --> 02:02:38,290
Two soldiers doing our jobs.

2930
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:39,910
It's like a sport.

2931
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:40,930
I thought there was an actual BGM.

2932
02:02:41,090 --> 02:02:41,850
No, it's just me.

2933
02:02:42,510 --> 02:02:44,690
Just violence, murdering each other.

2934
02:02:45,970 --> 02:02:46,770
It's just me.

2935
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:47,490
I think so too.

2936
02:02:48,050 --> 02:02:52,150
So if you were friends, then how do you explain the ninja's behavior?

2937
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:53,070
I don't know.

2938
02:02:53,110 --> 02:02:54,450
It's your genes.

2939
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:57,370
They make you predisposed toward violence.

2940
02:02:57,930 --> 02:02:59,590
You really like talking about genes.

2941
02:02:59,590 --> 02:03:01,070
I don't even know how to sing the song.

2942
02:03:01,090 --> 02:03:03,830
Naomi, why did you get into genetic research anyway?

2943
02:03:04,290 --> 02:03:05,270
Yeah, why did you?

2944
02:03:06,630 --> 02:03:07,430
I didn't know who my parents were.

2945
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:10,010
Or even what they looked like.

2946
02:03:10,230 --> 02:03:11,110
This is the truth.

2947
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:14,990
I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I am the way I am.

2948
02:03:15,070 --> 02:03:15,770
This is the truth.

2949
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:17,030
So you studied about DNA.

2950
02:03:17,630 --> 02:03:22,010
I thought if I could thoroughly understand DNA, I could get back my identity.

2951
02:03:23,330 --> 02:03:27,570
I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic information, Definitely made the cutscene better.

2952
02:03:27,570 --> 02:03:28,370
Oh, I'll keep going.

2953
02:03:28,430 --> 02:03:29,970
I could retrieve the blank spots in that person's memory.

2954
02:03:30,370 --> 02:03:32,030
Memory is stored in DNA.

2955
02:03:32,610 --> 02:03:33,490
We're not sure.

2956
02:03:33,490 --> 02:03:40,030
But we know that a person's genetic fate is determined just by the sequence of the four bases in their DNA.

2957
02:03:40,270 --> 02:03:41,910
So what about my fate?

2958
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:44,450
You know my DNA sequence, don't you?

2959
02:03:44,590 --> 02:03:45,230
Your fate?

2960
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:46,350
I...

2961
02:03:47,290 --> 02:03:47,990
I'm sorry.

2962
02:03:48,330 --> 02:03:49,570
I have no idea.

2963
02:03:50,010 --> 02:03:51,090
Of course not.

2964
02:03:51,450 --> 02:03:53,750
You're a scientist, not a fortune teller.

2965
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:57,880
Oh, that's gone.

2966
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:03,100
See, part of me is also like, I want to see these...

2967
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:03,680
Oh!

2968
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:07,320
My stomach!

2969
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:08,700
IBS!

2970
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:10,800
IBS real?

2971
02:04:11,620 --> 02:04:12,940
Go, Johnny, go!

2972
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,180
Go, Johnny, go!

2973
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:25,400
You okay in there?

2974
02:04:27,600 --> 02:04:29,840
If only we had the mic...

2975
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:33,740
Oh my god!

2976
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:36,660
Why does he walk like Sasquatch?

2977
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:37,880
Otacon, please!

2978
02:04:38,540 --> 02:04:39,660
Hey, I'm here.

2979
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:40,320
Oh my god.

2980
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:48,520
It's me.

2981
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:50,200
It's Otacon.

2982
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:51,720
Wow.

2983
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:54,040
They even captured you.

2984
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:55,540
I thought he was saying wow.

2985
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,460
Oh my god!

2986
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:00,040
Stop being a high school bully again!

2987
02:05:01,940 --> 02:05:03,100
Don't be mean to him!

2988
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:03,760
Oh my god!

2989
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:06,540
He can't do anything if you...

2990
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:07,900
Is that how you ask a guy a favor?

2991
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:08,900
Let me go!

2992
02:05:13,540 --> 02:05:14,580
What was...

2993
02:05:14,580 --> 02:05:15,120
Oh!

2994
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:17,400
Oh my...

2995
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:19,140
The bones?

2996
02:05:19,660 --> 02:05:20,380
Oh!

2997
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:25,140
It's like an animal's cage.

2998
02:05:25,540 --> 02:05:26,860
What a smell.

2999
02:05:28,260 --> 02:05:29,260
Yeah, cause of him.

3000
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:30,840
It's not me.

3001
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:32,480
Hey!

3002
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:34,800
It's the DARPA chief!

3003
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:36,600
Aye!

3004
02:05:37,060 --> 02:05:38,060
Aye aye!

3005
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:42,880
If you don't hurry up and get me out of here, I'll be laying next to him.

3006
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:45,940
Gamecube Snake has anger issues.

3007
02:05:45,980 --> 02:05:46,480
It's true.

3008
02:05:46,780 --> 02:05:48,840
You're such a high school bully to poor Otacon.

3009
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:52,780
This lock won't open with a security card.

3010
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:53,240
That's...

3011
02:05:53,740 --> 02:05:55,040
That's a ration.

3012
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,340
So what are you doing here then?

3013
02:05:58,760 --> 02:05:59,260
I...

3014
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,340
I thought you might be hungry.

3015
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:04,420
If you need more food, I can bring some more later.

3016
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:12,730
Also, I got you this level 6 card.

3017
02:06:13,030 --> 02:06:14,830
It'll get you out of that torture room.

3018
02:06:15,190 --> 02:06:15,690
Nice.

3019
02:06:15,770 --> 02:06:16,230
Here.

3020
02:06:16,230 --> 02:06:16,610
Take this.

3021
02:06:18,790 --> 02:06:20,110
I gotta submit though.

3022
02:06:20,290 --> 02:06:20,830
Sorry.

3023
02:06:21,390 --> 02:06:22,190
What's this?

3024
02:06:23,510 --> 02:06:24,710
It's a handkerchief.

3025
02:06:24,910 --> 02:06:26,910
I got it from Sniper Wolf.

3026
02:06:28,010 --> 02:06:28,570
Why?

3027
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:29,510
Why?

3028
02:06:29,910 --> 02:06:30,730
I don't know why.

3029
02:06:31,010 --> 02:06:32,890
But she's nice to me.

3030
02:06:33,670 --> 02:06:35,770
Sounds like Stockholm Syndrome to me.

3031
02:06:36,250 --> 02:06:38,650
I was taking care of the dogs here.

3032
02:06:39,050 --> 02:06:42,650
After the terrorists took over, they were planning to shoot all the dogs.

3033
02:06:43,030 --> 02:06:45,410
But Sniper Wolf stopped them.

3034
02:06:46,050 --> 02:06:48,210
She even let me feed them when I asked.

3035
02:06:49,170 --> 02:06:50,750
Then she fed me when I asked.

3036
02:06:50,970 --> 02:06:51,570
She likes dogs.

3037
02:06:52,150 --> 02:06:53,710
She must be a good person.

3038
02:06:54,150 --> 02:06:55,130
She likes dogs.

3039
02:06:55,210 --> 02:06:56,230
Just like me.

3040
02:06:56,370 --> 02:06:57,370
Wake up, you idiot.

3041
02:06:57,670 --> 02:06:59,210
She's the one who shot Meryl.

3042
02:07:00,350 --> 02:07:01,790
Well, that's all I can do.

3043
02:07:03,130 --> 02:07:04,790
They're planning to launch a nuke.

3044
02:07:04,950 --> 02:07:06,170
I've gotta stop them.

3045
02:07:07,110 --> 02:07:08,190
Don't hurt my girlfriend.

3046
02:07:08,410 --> 02:07:10,390
Then you'll have to get past the communications tower.

3047
02:07:10,830 --> 02:07:12,690
First I have to get me out of here.

3048
02:07:12,690 --> 02:07:13,950
Oh my god, Snake.

3049
02:07:14,270 --> 02:07:15,870
Come on, I'm trying my best.

3050
02:07:17,450 --> 02:07:18,810
That guard's got the key.

3051
02:07:19,210 --> 02:07:20,530
You'll have to take him out.

3052
02:07:21,090 --> 02:07:22,190
Give me a break.

3053
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:23,770
I'm no soldier.

3054
02:07:23,870 --> 02:07:25,230
I can't take anybody out.

3055
02:07:25,410 --> 02:07:27,290
Why is he acting like a zombie in a cage?

3056
02:07:27,570 --> 02:07:27,610
You have to.

3057
02:07:27,610 --> 02:07:28,170
I'll be killed.

3058
02:07:28,690 --> 02:07:29,790
Get out of here, Otacon.

3059
02:07:30,230 --> 02:07:30,970
He's coming back.

3060
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:34,230
That's what I just said.

3061
02:07:34,270 --> 02:07:34,710
See you later.

3062
02:07:35,750 --> 02:07:36,170
Bye.

3063
02:07:38,270 --> 02:07:39,110
Bye, Sasquatch.

3064
02:07:40,190 --> 02:07:42,130
Oh, it's because he's got the bad leg.

3065
02:07:42,690 --> 02:07:42,830
Oh my god.

3066
02:07:43,110 --> 02:07:45,630
I forgot that his leg is all messed up.

3067
02:07:51,550 --> 02:07:54,010
Oh, it actually tells me to use it.

3068
02:07:55,490 --> 02:07:56,050
Handkerchiefs.

3069
02:07:56,050 --> 02:07:57,210
Sniper Wolf's handkerchief.

3070
02:07:57,370 --> 02:07:58,710
Smells faintly of her.

3071
02:08:03,650 --> 02:08:05,350
Oh, we got our card.

3072
02:08:05,490 --> 02:08:05,830
Nice.

3073
02:08:05,950 --> 02:08:06,490
That's better.

3074
02:08:07,490 --> 02:08:09,270
Did you wash your hands, Johnny?

3075
02:08:12,930 --> 02:08:14,270
Did you wash your hands?

3076
02:08:15,470 --> 02:08:15,830
Johnny.

3077
02:08:16,510 --> 02:08:18,050
Johnny, you washed your hands, right?

3078
02:08:19,150 --> 02:08:20,670
You washed your hands, right?

3079
02:08:20,890 --> 02:08:21,250
Johnny.

3080
02:08:21,830 --> 02:08:22,190
Johnny.

3081
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:26,700
Shut up in there, will ya?

3082
02:08:28,140 --> 02:08:28,500
Sniffer.

3083
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:29,900
Shut up in there, will ya?

3084
02:08:29,980 --> 02:08:31,340
I actually really gotta go to the bathroom.

3085
02:08:31,580 --> 02:08:31,720
Hey.

3086
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:33,160
What?

3087
02:08:36,220 --> 02:08:36,860
Let me out!

3088
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:38,200
Let me out!

3089
02:08:38,980 --> 02:08:39,340
Hey.

3090
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:39,700
Hey.

3091
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:40,520
Hey.

3092
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:40,740
Hey.

3093
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:41,720
Hey.

3094
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:42,880
Hey.

3095
02:08:46,660 --> 02:08:47,260
CQC.

3096
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:49,220
He fell asleep.

3097
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:53,780
They're giving me every opportunity to use this ketchup.

3098
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:54,480
They're giving me every opportunity to use this ketchup.

3099
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:54,980
They're like, hey.

3100
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:57,560
You wanna use it?

3101
02:08:59,160 --> 02:08:59,760
Oh.

3102
02:08:59,800 --> 02:08:59,940
Oh.

3103
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:01,740
Shoot.

3104
02:09:02,140 --> 02:09:04,220
That cold medicine knocked me out.

3105
02:09:05,340 --> 02:09:07,000
And it doesn't even work.

3106
02:09:07,160 --> 02:09:08,240
It doesn't even work.

3107
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:10,420
I'm so sleepy.

3108
02:09:10,640 --> 02:09:11,080
You know what?

3109
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:11,580
I'm sleepy.

3110
02:09:11,780 --> 02:09:12,860
Maybe if I walk a little.

3111
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:13,860
Yeah, walk around.

3112
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:14,680
Walk it off, buddy.

3113
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:15,200
Walk it off.

3114
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:21,680
The funny part, too, is like, it looks like Johnny.

3115
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:24,560
Like, I can see Johnny with those eyes.

3116
02:09:24,660 --> 02:09:25,040
You know?

3117
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:28,280
Like, that looks like Johnny to me.

3118
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:29,720
Come here.

3119
02:09:29,780 --> 02:09:29,980
Come here.

3120
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:31,340
Come here, Johnny.

3121
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:32,700
Look at me.

3122
02:09:32,980 --> 02:09:33,620
I don't know.

3123
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:34,600
It just looks like him.

3124
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:37,000
Bless you.

3125
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:41,080
I won't.

3126
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:41,520
I won't.

3127
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:42,720
I won't be silenced.

3128
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:44,220
I won't be silenced.

3129
02:09:44,540 --> 02:09:46,300
You can't stop me.

3130
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:47,180
What are you gonna do?

3131
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:47,640
Come in here?

3132
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:49,300
Oh.

3133
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:52,580
Alright, guys.

3134
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:56,400
It's time to submit.

3135
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:02,300
It's time to submit like the little baby that I am.

3136
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:04,280
Remember to give up.

3137
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:06,300
You know, it's really hard not to sometimes.

3138
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:09,080
But also, I wanted to see the cutscenes, too.

3139
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:09,560
So...

3140
02:10:10,660 --> 02:10:11,280
Seeing the...

3141
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:13,920
Seeing the Ocelot one was fun.

3142
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:15,640
Once more.

3143
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:24,980
Submit to you, Ocelot.

3144
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:31,200
Catrice!

3145
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:32,180
Welcome to the membership.

3146
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:32,620
Thank you!

3147
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:35,280
Okay.

3148
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:37,360
Let's get started.

3149
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:39,600
So submissive and torturable.

3150
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:40,940
Stop!

3151
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:43,560
Okay.

3152
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:44,940
So it's start and A.

3153
02:10:45,740 --> 02:10:46,120
Here.

3154
02:10:48,180 --> 02:10:49,140
Go submit!

3155
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:50,960
Victory to the 10 gifted!

3156
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:52,200
What do you mean submit?

3157
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:53,360
Oh, Meryl?

3158
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:54,220
Don't look.

3159
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:54,980
Meryl?

3160
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:57,660
Meryl, shield your eyes.

3161
02:10:57,880 --> 02:10:58,520
Forever.

3162
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:00,460
Had enough?

3163
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:03,420
So, you're human after all.

3164
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:04,580
It does feel wrong, doesn't it?

3165
02:11:04,680 --> 02:11:05,500
It does feel wrong.

3166
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:09,640
But I'll take the woman in return.

3167
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:12,260
I'll have my fun with her.

3168
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:14,600
Before I kill her.

3169
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:17,040
What do you mean by that?

3170
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:18,660
Did he just head pat me?

3171
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:19,380
Meryl!

3172
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:20,740
Meryl!

3173
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:24,860
I hope you can still look at yourself in the mirror, my friend.

3174
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:27,560
No!

3175
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:31,440
No!

3176
02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:32,460
No!

3177
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:32,980
No!

3178
02:11:32,980 --> 02:11:33,220
No!

3179
02:11:37,950 --> 02:11:39,310
Wait, they're taking me away?

3180
02:11:40,610 --> 02:11:42,070
Do I still get to use the catch up then?

3181
02:11:43,950 --> 02:11:44,430
Mero!

3182
02:11:45,310 --> 02:11:46,470
Metal Gear is amazing.

3183
02:11:47,090 --> 02:11:48,110
Man, you can't do that!

3184
02:11:48,170 --> 02:11:49,050
The future will be changed!

3185
02:11:49,470 --> 02:11:51,130
You created a time paradox!

3186
02:11:53,610 --> 02:11:54,230
It's okay.

3187
02:11:54,930 --> 02:11:57,870
That's why this is not the canon game, right?

3188
02:12:02,610 --> 02:12:03,570
Bless you!

3189
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:07,860
Here it comes.

3190
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:10,460
Oh, not again!

3191
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:15,160
Oh, that sounds like you relieved yourself, mister.

3192
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:18,080
That didn't sound like...

3193
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:19,220
There he goes.

3194
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:21,400
That's me.

3195
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:22,880
That's gonna be me in a few minutes.

3196
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:32,840
I pulled an Otacon.

3197
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:40,960
Oh, wait.

3198
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:41,580
No, no, no.

3199
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:41,860
Lay down.

3200
02:12:41,960 --> 02:12:42,460
Lay down, Snake.

3201
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:43,320
There we go.

3202
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:43,640
Okay.

3203
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:44,460
I'm dead.

3204
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:47,880
I'm dead, I'm dead.

3205
02:12:48,060 --> 02:12:49,120
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

3206
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:54,020
Wait!

3207
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:24,400
My stuff.

3208
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:25,380
My stuff.

3209
02:13:27,540 --> 02:13:27,940
Yippee!

3210
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:32,700
Call?

3211
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:34,300
Who should I call?

3212
02:13:35,020 --> 02:13:35,700
Call Campbell?

3213
02:13:39,220 --> 02:13:39,620
Yes!

3214
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:43,760
Okay.

3215
02:13:45,220 --> 02:13:45,700
Um...

3216
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:47,260
Master Miller.

3217
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:48,040
I'm alive.

3218
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:48,760
I'm good.

3219
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:53,080
Right.

3220
02:13:57,740 --> 02:13:58,160
I go.

3221
02:13:58,320 --> 02:13:58,660
I know.

3222
02:13:59,020 --> 02:14:01,320
I know what's in... I know what's in there.

3223
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:03,180
Merrill, you good?

3224
02:14:12,530 --> 02:14:13,630
He doesn't know.

3225
02:14:14,050 --> 02:14:14,050
No.

3226
02:14:14,050 --> 02:14:15,270
I can't believe it actually worked.

3227
02:14:15,390 --> 02:14:15,630
No.

3228
02:14:15,650 --> 02:14:17,310
I can't believe it actually worked.

3229
02:14:17,430 --> 02:14:19,250
Otacon, you genius, you.

3230
02:14:20,090 --> 02:14:20,950
Hey, Nastasha.

3231
02:14:21,010 --> 02:14:23,050
Do you know anything about the bomb that's in my inventory?

3232
02:14:23,290 --> 02:14:23,770
Or...

3233
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:28,970
I guess not.

3234
02:14:29,970 --> 02:14:31,250
She doesn't know anything.

3235
02:14:35,180 --> 02:14:35,470
Yeah.

3236
02:14:36,070 --> 02:14:37,070
Just gonna save.

3237
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:38,410
Bomb?

3238
02:14:38,410 --> 02:14:38,470
Bomb?

3239
02:14:41,290 --> 02:14:45,590
I have to go to the bathroom so bad.

3240
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:47,690
But I'm waiting to...

3241
02:14:47,690 --> 02:14:48,630
Good luck, Snake.

3242
02:14:48,930 --> 02:14:49,470
Thank you.

3243
02:14:50,630 --> 02:14:51,170
Okay.

3244
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:53,530
Start A button to exit.

3245
02:14:55,870 --> 02:14:57,230
Where is that?

3246
02:14:58,810 --> 02:14:59,830
Not the book.

3247
02:15:01,810 --> 02:15:02,610
Is it...

3248
02:15:02,610 --> 02:15:03,430
Is it in...

3249
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:03,770
Wait.

3250
02:15:03,890 --> 02:15:04,670
Is it in here?

3251
02:15:05,390 --> 02:15:05,930
No.

3252
02:15:07,790 --> 02:15:08,690
Where is it?

3253
02:15:13,370 --> 02:15:13,970
Mindy.

3254
02:15:14,390 --> 02:15:14,990
Palky.

3255
02:15:18,830 --> 02:15:19,130
Huh?

3256
02:15:20,210 --> 02:15:20,810
Wait.

3257
02:15:21,450 --> 02:15:23,290
Oh, there's no bomb if you surrender?

3258
02:15:24,870 --> 02:15:25,470
Really?

3259
02:15:28,150 --> 02:15:29,130
That's funny.

3260
02:15:29,750 --> 02:15:30,510
Hold on.

3261
02:15:30,570 --> 02:15:31,030
I wanna...

3262
02:15:31,910 --> 02:15:33,270
I wanna shoot him.

3263
02:15:33,450 --> 02:15:34,070
Not dead.

3264
02:15:34,850 --> 02:15:36,730
He's got a whole life to live.

3265
02:15:41,170 --> 02:15:43,830
But, you know, I wanna make sure he's, like, actually knocked out.

3266
02:15:43,970 --> 02:15:44,210
Oh.

3267
02:15:44,370 --> 02:15:45,650
I guess he's not gonna wake up.

3268
02:15:46,230 --> 02:15:46,650
Okay.

3269
02:15:48,550 --> 02:15:48,970
Really?

3270
02:15:49,130 --> 02:15:52,430
There's no bomb if you...

3271
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:53,110
Huh.

3272
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:54,990
Good to know, I guess.

3273
02:15:56,230 --> 02:15:56,650
Pew.

3274
02:15:56,710 --> 02:15:56,890
Pew.

3275
02:15:57,130 --> 02:15:57,550
Wait.

3276
02:15:59,150 --> 02:16:00,810
Why does this always happen to me?

3277
02:16:02,550 --> 02:16:03,270
Oh, man.

3278
02:16:04,050 --> 02:16:04,470
Okay.

3279
02:16:06,590 --> 02:16:08,890
Johnny without Meryl's kind of a sad future?

3280
02:16:10,190 --> 02:16:11,490
Nah, he'll be fine.

3281
02:16:12,690 --> 02:16:13,510
He'll be fine.

3282
02:16:14,270 --> 02:16:17,010
He'll find someone else who will love his...

3283
02:16:17,950 --> 02:16:21,110
Who will love him for how he...

3284
02:16:21,110 --> 02:16:23,290
Yeah, I don't think it's a good idea to go in there.

3285
02:16:23,370 --> 02:16:24,370
I think it's, like, really gross.

3286
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:31,320
Who just sneezed?

3287
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:36,160
Who just...

3288
02:16:36,660 --> 02:16:38,020
Who just sneezed?

3289
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:41,140
Oh, me?

3290
02:16:42,140 --> 02:16:42,940
I sneezed?

3291
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:47,040
That's so cute.

3292
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:49,880
Bless you, me.

3293
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:51,540
It was me.

3294
02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:51,940
Sorry.

3295
02:16:55,700 --> 02:16:56,900
He's not gonna see me, right?

3296
02:17:07,060 --> 02:17:07,580
What's this?

3297
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:08,760
Oh, that's an elevator?

3298
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:10,400
Oh.

3299
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:12,160
Yes.

3300
02:17:12,360 --> 02:17:13,180
This is where we're at.

3301
02:17:13,300 --> 02:17:13,420
See?

3302
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:16,340
Remember, like, this part is kind of, like, a blur to me.

3303
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:16,920
So...

3304
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:17,100
Oh.

3305
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:18,560
Oh, we're back in here.

3306
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:19,420
Okay.

3307
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:19,760
Okay.

3308
02:17:19,820 --> 02:17:20,020
Okay.

3309
02:17:20,060 --> 02:17:20,240
Okay.

3310
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:22,220
So now...

3311
02:17:22,220 --> 02:17:23,960
Wait, Colonel, where do I go again?

3312
02:17:24,060 --> 02:17:24,600
I'm so sorry.

3313
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:26,500
Kusami taskaru.

3314
02:17:28,220 --> 02:17:28,660
Hakushon!

3315
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:33,720
Um...

3316
02:17:33,720 --> 02:17:34,100
Why?

3317
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:35,980
I feel fine.

3318
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:36,840
Oh.

3319
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:37,500
Oh.

3320
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:38,740
I think I'm catching a cold.

3321
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:39,900
I think I'm catching a cold.

3322
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:40,180
Oh!

3323
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:40,360
Oh!

3324
02:17:42,100 --> 02:17:42,900
He's so cute.

3325
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:46,160
Your body temperature is elevated and your lymph nodes are slightly swollen.

3326
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:47,320
But don't worry.

3327
02:17:47,420 --> 02:17:49,660
It appears to be just a mild rhinovirus.

3328
02:17:49,980 --> 02:17:51,720
I guess I got it from that soldier.

3329
02:17:52,060 --> 02:17:52,260
Ew.

3330
02:17:52,380 --> 02:17:54,880
I've increased your nutrition and elevated your blood sugar level.

3331
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:56,320
You can't cure it.

3332
02:17:56,460 --> 02:17:57,060
Sorry, Snake.

3333
02:17:57,280 --> 02:17:59,040
The nanomachines don't carry antibiotics.

3334
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:01,420
Maybe you could find some garlic.

3335
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:03,840
It contains natural antibiotics, you know.

3336
02:18:03,860 --> 02:18:03,920
Garlic?

3337
02:18:04,020 --> 02:18:05,120
I'm a garlic girl.

3338
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:06,280
Ugh.

3339
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:07,160
Raw garlic.

3340
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:08,720
Give me a break.

3341
02:18:08,980 --> 02:18:09,620
Give me a break.

3342
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:11,660
Um, your dad would have said delicious.

3343
02:18:11,660 --> 02:18:11,680
I want some more.

3344
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:13,660
There must be some cold medicine somewhere on the base.

3345
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:15,420
That would make you feel better.

3346
02:18:15,560 --> 02:18:15,700
Oh.

3347
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:19,900
If not, you'll just have to wait until your body's natural defenses take over.

3348
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:20,700
I'm sorry.

3349
02:18:20,900 --> 02:18:22,280
The nanomachines?

3350
02:18:23,680 --> 02:18:27,100
The nanomachines can't cure a common cold.

3351
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:34,500
But with what we know about nanomachines...

3352
02:18:38,290 --> 02:18:39,030
I'm sorry.

3353
02:18:39,110 --> 02:18:39,410
They had...

3354
02:18:39,410 --> 02:18:40,470
I'm sorry.

3355
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:42,790
Huh?

3356
02:18:42,950 --> 02:18:44,530
They cannot cure a common cold?

3357
02:18:45,910 --> 02:18:46,750
And yet?

3358
02:18:47,490 --> 02:18:48,230
And yet?

3359
02:18:49,530 --> 02:18:50,770
Early nanomachines, son.

3360
02:18:51,610 --> 02:18:52,330
I actually...

3361
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:53,890
I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

3362
02:18:54,470 --> 02:18:55,470
I'm gonna go potty.

3363
02:18:56,310 --> 02:18:56,750
Um...

3364
02:18:57,290 --> 02:18:58,130
And, uh...

3365
02:18:58,130 --> 02:18:59,250
You know, don't clip that.

3366
02:19:00,190 --> 02:19:01,470
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

3367
02:19:01,590 --> 02:19:02,110
I'm gonna go to the little...

3368
02:19:02,110 --> 02:19:03,310
Go to the little ghosties girl...

3369
02:19:03,310 --> 02:19:03,930
Ghosty girl room.

3370
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:05,190
So...

3371
02:19:05,190 --> 02:19:06,490
I will be right back.

3372
02:19:06,550 --> 02:19:08,090
Actually, I'm gonna rewrite this.

3373
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:10,310
Bathroom break.

3374
02:19:12,410 --> 02:19:13,670
And I will be...

3375
02:19:14,430 --> 02:19:15,070
Right back.

3376
02:19:15,310 --> 02:19:15,550
Okay.

3377
02:19:16,290 --> 02:19:16,730
Okay.

3378
02:19:16,750 --> 02:19:17,950
I will be right back.

3379
02:19:18,990 --> 02:19:19,490
BRB.

3380
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:52,460
La la la.

3381
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:53,740
La la la.

3382
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:54,280
I hope.

3383
02:21:54,680 --> 02:21:57,060
I hope that everyone has been good.

3384
02:21:57,180 --> 02:22:01,700
I hope that people haven't been sending, um...

3385
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:02,980
Wasteful donuts.

3386
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:16,840
Bet she forgot to wash her hands.

3387
02:22:16,980 --> 02:22:18,260
I never forget.

3388
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:21,680
Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever forget.

3389
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:25,300
Give me one.

3390
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:25,660
One.

3391
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:26,280
One second though.

3392
02:22:28,380 --> 02:22:28,940
Um...

3393
02:22:28,940 --> 02:22:30,060
Hmm.

3394
02:22:32,750 --> 02:22:33,310
Hmm.

3395
02:22:33,470 --> 02:22:33,490
Hmm.

3396
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:34,090
Hmm.

3397
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:35,750
Okay.

3398
02:22:37,750 --> 02:22:38,310
Okay.

3399
02:22:38,690 --> 02:22:39,650
Now we're good.

3400
02:22:40,410 --> 02:22:41,170
Okie dokie.

3401
02:22:41,270 --> 02:22:42,630
I sent you a pizza.

3402
02:22:43,350 --> 02:22:43,910
Dang!

3403
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:46,750
I was just thinking I was starting to get hungry.

3404
02:22:48,310 --> 02:22:48,870
Alrighty.

3405
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:53,070
Uh, Colonel, where's the communication tower?

3406
02:22:54,690 --> 02:22:55,250
Colonel?

3407
02:22:56,190 --> 02:22:57,150
Where's the tower?

3408
02:22:57,350 --> 02:22:57,890
Okay.

3409
02:22:57,910 --> 02:22:58,270
I don't remember.

3410
02:22:58,730 --> 02:22:59,470
Where do I go?

3411
02:23:02,250 --> 02:23:04,890
There must be some cold medicine somewhere on the base.

3412
02:23:05,150 --> 02:23:06,650
That would make you feel better.

3413
02:23:06,730 --> 02:23:07,010
Yeah.

3414
02:23:07,010 --> 02:23:08,150
It would, but like...

3415
02:23:08,150 --> 02:23:11,130
If not, you'll just have to wait until your body's natural defenses take over.

3416
02:23:11,230 --> 02:23:11,270
Oh!

3417
02:23:11,290 --> 02:23:11,810
Sorry guys.

3418
02:23:12,970 --> 02:23:13,650
Thank you.

3419
02:23:14,770 --> 02:23:15,490
So sorry.

3420
02:23:17,470 --> 02:23:18,290
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

3421
02:23:20,590 --> 02:23:21,250
Okay, okay.

3422
02:23:21,650 --> 02:23:22,190
Okay, okay.

3423
02:23:22,530 --> 02:23:23,270
Bathroom break.

3424
02:23:25,430 --> 02:23:26,950
Forever bathroom break.

3425
02:23:27,270 --> 02:23:27,890
I'm jogging.

3426
02:23:27,890 --> 02:23:28,130
I'm jogging.

3427
02:23:29,410 --> 02:23:31,290
What would you consider wasteful?

3428
02:23:31,910 --> 02:23:32,390
Oh.

3429
02:23:32,490 --> 02:23:32,750
Wow.

3430
02:23:32,870 --> 02:23:33,030
Whoa.

3431
02:23:33,430 --> 02:23:34,910
Um, you know, just, uh...

3432
02:23:35,810 --> 02:23:36,290
Spamming...

3433
02:23:37,410 --> 02:23:37,890
Spamming...

3434
02:23:38,630 --> 02:23:39,110
Uh...

3435
02:23:39,110 --> 02:23:40,290
Ones, you know?

3436
02:23:40,490 --> 02:23:40,970
Yeah.

3437
02:23:42,830 --> 02:23:43,750
You should...

3438
02:23:43,750 --> 02:23:45,610
You could buy a gumball with that.

3439
02:23:48,970 --> 02:23:49,810
So calm.

3440
02:23:53,900 --> 02:23:55,020
My health is good.

3441
02:23:55,220 --> 02:23:56,340
My rations are full.

3442
02:23:57,860 --> 02:23:58,880
I'm a healthy guy.

3443
02:23:59,240 --> 02:24:00,100
How do I get through this?

3444
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:01,160
Where do I go?

3445
02:24:01,940 --> 02:24:02,440
One.

3446
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:02,800
One.

3447
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:03,700
One.

3448
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:05,340
One.

3449
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:06,220
One.

3450
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:06,660
One, one, one.

3451
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:08,640
Oh bless you.

3452
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:10,340
Wait.

3453
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:10,720
Do they...

3454
02:24:10,720 --> 02:24:11,760
Do you think they have some in here?

3455
02:24:12,380 --> 02:24:13,320
Any cold medicine?

3456
02:24:13,700 --> 02:24:14,900
It's a medical room!

3457
02:24:15,320 --> 02:24:16,980
There has to be...

3458
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:20,480
Is Johnny gone?

3459
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:21,800
Watch.

3460
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:23,180
It's probably like...

3461
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:25,900
In the...

3462
02:24:26,820 --> 02:24:27,320
Oh.

3463
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:30,100
Oh.

3464
02:24:32,100 --> 02:24:34,640
It's probably in the locker that I couldn't get into.

3465
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:42,440
It's probably in here.

3466
02:24:47,460 --> 02:24:48,700
Oh shoot.

3467
02:24:49,720 --> 02:24:50,960
One dollar.

3468
02:24:52,780 --> 02:24:53,700
Oh, ew!

3469
02:24:54,360 --> 02:24:56,360
Oh my god, that's nasty!

3470
02:24:57,840 --> 02:24:58,520
Snake!

3471
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:09,200
I think there's probably one in here, but I can't get to it.

3472
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:09,820
What should I do?

3473
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:11,800
What should I do?

3474
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,920
Seems pretty economic to me.

3475
02:25:16,020 --> 02:25:17,220
It's going to a good cause.

3476
02:25:17,420 --> 02:25:17,900
Is it?

3477
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:19,200
Is it?

3478
02:25:19,400 --> 02:25:20,240
He's cold.

3479
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:23,180
If you're cold, he's cold.

3480
02:25:23,460 --> 02:25:24,460
Let him in.

3481
02:25:26,420 --> 02:25:27,460
Oh gosh.

3482
02:25:34,090 --> 02:25:35,590
There's something else here, right?

3483
02:25:36,010 --> 02:25:36,530
No?

3484
02:25:38,450 --> 02:25:40,810
This is the medical room and they don't have anything?

3485
02:25:41,110 --> 02:25:42,650
Medical room my butt.

3486
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:44,150
Oh!

3487
02:25:44,230 --> 02:25:44,650
Bless you.

3488
02:25:45,350 --> 02:25:47,370
He's so cute.

3489
02:25:47,630 --> 02:25:48,610
His little sneezes.

3490
02:25:49,650 --> 02:25:53,550
You have such a bad constitution, Snake, if you got sick that quickly.

3491
02:25:54,190 --> 02:25:55,630
You ran into him one time.

3492
02:25:57,330 --> 02:25:58,570
Rations aren't garlic?

3493
02:25:59,750 --> 02:26:00,950
I don't know, actually.

3494
02:26:02,590 --> 02:26:03,150
Okay.

3495
02:26:09,250 --> 02:26:09,970
Bless you.

3496
02:26:11,310 --> 02:26:12,470
Oh, in the vent!

3497
02:26:12,650 --> 02:26:13,650
Oh, so true, so true.

3498
02:26:14,350 --> 02:26:15,370
The vent over here.

3499
02:26:25,400 --> 02:26:26,360
There's rations.

3500
02:26:27,400 --> 02:26:28,980
There might be medicine down here.

3501
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:30,460
I feel...

3502
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:33,660
I feel like I had some medicine.

3503
02:26:34,180 --> 02:26:36,160
I feel like I at least saw some medicine.

3504
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:36,720
Something.

3505
02:26:40,420 --> 02:26:42,320
Johnny was carrying sneeze die.

3506
02:26:45,820 --> 02:26:47,700
There's medicine in Psycho Mantis's area.

3507
02:26:47,780 --> 02:26:48,440
You have to go there anyway.

3508
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:48,880
Oh!

3509
02:26:49,320 --> 02:26:50,080
Oh, you know what?

3510
02:26:50,220 --> 02:26:52,020
You're so right because...

3511
02:26:52,020 --> 02:26:53,520
You're right, you're right, you're right.

3512
02:26:53,540 --> 02:26:54,500
Because that's...

3513
02:26:54,500 --> 02:26:57,360
We were going to the communications tower and that's when we get stopped.

3514
02:26:58,360 --> 02:26:58,760
Yes!

3515
02:26:58,760 --> 02:27:00,180
It's all coming back to me.

3516
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:00,800
Yes!

3517
02:27:01,720 --> 02:27:02,820
Sneaky Sneezy Snake.

3518
02:27:05,460 --> 02:27:05,860
Oh,

3519
02:27:16,890 --> 02:27:18,910
I have to go all the way back to the third building.

3520
02:27:32,120 --> 02:27:36,400
This game is the first game to ever start my MGS brain rot as a kid.

3521
02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:38,820
Never did play the OG game until years...

3522
02:27:39,300 --> 02:27:40,680
Years later, really?

3523
02:27:42,660 --> 02:27:44,520
Even though this is so much...

3524
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:48,900
So vastly different from the original game, it is still a lot of fun.

3525
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:54,540
It is still a great game to get your start on.

3526
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:56,800
I believe.

3527
02:28:11,210 --> 02:28:12,430
That scared me.

3528
02:28:12,570 --> 02:28:14,190
That scared me more than anything.

3529
02:28:15,990 --> 02:28:17,970
That scared me more than anything.

3530
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:28,360
Nothing to report.

3531
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:30,480
What?

3532
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:33,940
It's no one.

3533
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:35,160
Actually.

3534
02:28:36,680 --> 02:28:37,420
See ya.

3535
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:40,700
It's no one actually.

3536
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:44,240
Actually.

3537
02:28:44,320 --> 02:28:45,200
Actually, how did he see me?

3538
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:47,860
Actually, how did he see me?

3539
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:51,340
How did he see me?

3540
02:28:54,380 --> 02:28:54,860
Actually.

3541
02:28:55,220 --> 02:28:57,700
You don't even know why I'm...

3542
02:29:03,020 --> 02:29:03,980
Stream sniping.

3543
02:29:05,380 --> 02:29:07,480
That guy is actually 180 IQ.

3544
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:15,740
Okay, now we gotta go through this nonsense again.

3545
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:20,420
Oh, oh, I passed it.

3546
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:26,440
Okay.

3547
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:29,320
Honestly?

3548
02:29:30,660 --> 02:29:32,720
Just fake a British accent and pretend you're liquid?

3549
02:29:32,860 --> 02:29:36,480
The smartest thing would have to been to bleach my hair?

3550
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:38,040
And...

3551
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:38,620
Nothing here.

3552
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:39,220
Ooh.

3553
02:29:39,460 --> 02:29:39,980
Ooh.

3554
02:29:40,460 --> 02:29:40,980
Robot?

3555
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:43,760
Was that a robot?

3556
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:50,200
It would have been to bleach my hair and pretend to actually be liquid.

3557
02:29:50,920 --> 02:29:51,580
You know?

3558
02:29:53,220 --> 02:29:54,020
Kind of like...

3559
02:29:54,020 --> 02:29:55,480
Kind of like using the Rykov...

3560
02:29:55,480 --> 02:29:57,080
The Rykov mask.

3561
02:29:59,060 --> 02:30:01,500
I think I should join the team.

3562
02:30:01,820 --> 02:30:03,960
I think I could have given them way better advice.

3563
02:30:06,580 --> 02:30:08,160
This poor guy's ankles.

3564
02:30:10,520 --> 02:30:11,000
Okay.

3565
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:14,440
Let's see.

3566
02:30:14,540 --> 02:30:14,940
Okay.

3567
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:22,060
Now, this is the tricky part because as soon as we take him down, they're gonna be like...

3568
02:30:23,560 --> 02:30:24,440
Something, something, something?

3569
02:30:24,960 --> 02:30:25,540
Someone's here?

3570
02:30:26,660 --> 02:30:28,060
Where's your status report?

3571
02:30:28,360 --> 02:30:29,160
La dee do dee doo?

3572
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:30,040
You know?

3573
02:30:30,300 --> 02:30:31,720
So we got to...

3574
02:30:33,900 --> 02:30:34,780
Figure out...

3575
02:30:34,780 --> 02:30:35,840
Yeah, freeze him again.

3576
02:30:35,960 --> 02:30:36,400
But...

3577
02:30:36,400 --> 02:30:38,540
If I freeze him, I gotta be fast.

3578
02:30:39,340 --> 02:30:40,240
I gotta be so fast.

3579
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:44,420
I'm scared because there's the other guy that...

3580
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:44,920
He doesn't...

3581
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:46,060
He does walk around, I guess, then.

3582
02:30:46,180 --> 02:30:47,920
Because otherwise, he wouldn't have...

3583
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:49,720
I don't know his path at all.

3584
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:51,880
The guy...

3585
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:52,120
Oh, here.

3586
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:52,520
Let's check.

3587
02:30:52,600 --> 02:30:52,880
Let's check.

3588
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:54,620
Let's see where he comes from.

3589
02:30:56,680 --> 02:30:57,180
Let's see.

3590
02:30:57,300 --> 02:30:59,060
Because there's a guy...

3591
02:30:59,060 --> 02:31:01,360
The guy saw me over there, you know?

3592
02:31:02,180 --> 02:31:02,540
Hmm.

3593
02:31:02,740 --> 02:31:03,000
Hmm.

3594
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:03,340
Hmm.

3595
02:31:03,340 --> 02:31:03,620
Hmm.

3596
02:31:04,820 --> 02:31:05,220
Hmm.

3597
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:05,700
Hmm.

3598
02:31:07,990 --> 02:31:08,390
Hmm.

3599
02:31:08,470 --> 02:31:08,750
Hmm.

3600
02:31:08,770 --> 02:31:08,810
Hmm.

3601
02:31:08,810 --> 02:31:09,010
Hmm.

3602
02:31:09,050 --> 02:31:09,090
Hmm.

3603
02:31:09,090 --> 02:31:09,250
Hmm.

3604
02:31:09,410 --> 02:31:09,810
Hmm.

3605
02:31:09,910 --> 02:31:09,970
Hmm.

3606
02:31:10,550 --> 02:31:10,950
Hmm.

3607
02:31:14,350 --> 02:31:14,750
Hmm.

3608
02:31:17,170 --> 02:31:18,650
Okay, here are the other walking.

3609
02:31:25,070 --> 02:31:25,750
Does he...

3610
02:31:25,750 --> 02:31:27,010
Does anyone ever show up?

3611
02:31:29,910 --> 02:31:30,870
He's sleeping.

3612
02:31:34,380 --> 02:31:36,940
Like, there was someone that came and caught me.

3613
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:38,540
How, though?

3614
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:43,580
I don't understand.

3615
02:31:43,700 --> 02:31:44,220
Where did they...

3616
02:31:44,220 --> 02:31:45,840
Where did they come from?

3617
02:31:49,060 --> 02:31:50,620
I hope Snake doesn't sneeze.

3618
02:31:50,980 --> 02:31:52,040
He wouldn't.

3619
02:31:52,180 --> 02:31:53,140
He's better now.

3620
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:54,680
Right, Snake?

3621
02:31:55,740 --> 02:31:56,260
Snake?

3622
02:31:57,060 --> 02:31:57,420
Yeah.

3623
02:31:58,680 --> 02:31:59,500
He's better now.

3624
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:03,000
Probably the guy upstairs heard you.

3625
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:05,420
Oh, you think he came, like, running down?

3626
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:07,000
Hmm.

3627
02:32:07,880 --> 02:32:08,240
Maybe.

3628
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:10,500
Okay, so I freeze him.

3629
02:32:10,540 --> 02:32:11,060
I come out.

3630
02:32:12,100 --> 02:32:13,160
I knock him out.

3631
02:32:13,240 --> 02:32:14,160
And then I get in the box.

3632
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:16,840
Or I get in the truck.

3633
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:17,640
In the box.

3634
02:32:17,960 --> 02:32:18,320
Okay.

3635
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:18,740
Here we go.

3636
02:32:20,900 --> 02:32:21,260
Freeze.

3637
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:27,000
Freeze?

3638
02:32:28,900 --> 02:32:29,260
Freeze.

3639
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:29,480
Freeze!

3640
02:32:30,380 --> 02:32:30,820
Dropping specified info.

3641
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:32,940
Freeze!

3642
02:32:33,340 --> 02:32:33,440
Freeze.

3643
02:32:34,840 --> 02:32:35,280
Freeze.

3644
02:32:35,700 --> 02:32:35,740
Freeze.

3645
02:32:35,740 --> 02:32:35,880
Freeze.

3646
02:32:38,300 --> 02:32:38,740
Freeze.

3647
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:39,100
Freeze.

3648
02:32:39,100 --> 02:32:39,220
Freeze.

3649
02:32:50,550 --> 02:32:51,770
I don't wanna...

3650
02:32:52,770 --> 02:32:53,210
Okay...

3651
02:32:53,210 --> 02:32:54,850
Maybe this is not working.

3652
02:32:55,130 --> 02:32:57,030
So, he's so shivery.

3653
02:32:57,270 --> 02:32:58,610
Hey, cold buddy, you just go inside.

3654
02:32:59,110 --> 02:33:00,230
There's no one here, anyway.

3655
02:33:00,230 --> 02:33:01,470
Anyway, nothing here.

3656
02:33:01,850 --> 02:33:03,330
I can do the report for you.

3657
02:33:03,630 --> 02:33:04,430
Nothing here.

3658
02:33:05,790 --> 02:33:06,190
Freeze!

3659
02:33:06,590 --> 02:33:06,990
Freeze!

3660
02:33:07,250 --> 02:33:07,650
Freeze!

3661
02:33:08,870 --> 02:33:09,270
Freeze!

3662
02:33:11,650 --> 02:33:12,050
Freeze!

3663
02:33:12,310 --> 02:33:12,710
Freeze!

3664
02:33:15,090 --> 02:33:18,070
Snake, if you were a mirror, 149 set of ears tall.

3665
02:33:18,390 --> 02:33:20,570
How small do you think I am?

3666
02:33:22,790 --> 02:33:23,190
Okay.

3667
02:33:23,990 --> 02:33:25,370
I think he's falling asleep.

3668
02:33:25,530 --> 02:33:26,090
I think so too.

3669
02:33:26,550 --> 02:33:28,370
But then how did we get it to work before?

3670
02:33:31,050 --> 02:33:31,490
Weird.

3671
02:33:31,490 --> 02:33:32,310
Okay, hold on.

3672
02:33:34,230 --> 02:33:35,270
You know what?

3673
02:33:35,770 --> 02:33:36,830
I'm gonna... okay.

3674
02:33:37,110 --> 02:33:38,390
This might not work.

3675
02:33:40,050 --> 02:33:41,750
This might not work, but...

3676
02:33:42,550 --> 02:33:43,710
If we die, whatever.

3677
02:33:43,910 --> 02:33:44,630
At least we tried.

3678
02:33:47,590 --> 02:33:48,950
Did he wake up from that noise?

3679
02:34:13,240 --> 02:34:14,480
Why didn't that work?

3680
02:34:14,840 --> 02:34:15,240
It exploded.

3681
02:34:16,940 --> 02:34:17,980
It went off?

3682
02:34:23,940 --> 02:34:25,380
It went off?

3683
02:34:25,640 --> 02:34:26,820
Why didn't it work?

3684
02:34:28,200 --> 02:34:29,640
Yeah, did it stun him at all?

3685
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:31,880
Oh my gosh.

3686
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:35,740
Aren't you 152 centimeters?

3687
02:34:36,380 --> 02:34:36,940
Yeah.

3688
02:34:37,860 --> 02:34:38,420
Duh.

3689
02:34:42,930 --> 02:34:45,110
They nerfed the stun grenade in this game.

3690
02:34:46,150 --> 02:34:47,710
Get closer for the freeze?

3691
02:34:47,950 --> 02:34:48,890
Okay, let's try it.

3692
02:34:53,230 --> 02:34:53,630
Oh.

3693
02:34:53,970 --> 02:34:54,630
Wait, hold on.

3694
02:34:54,910 --> 02:34:55,310
Closer.

3695
02:34:58,070 --> 02:34:59,230
Oh, I got it.

3696
02:34:59,270 --> 02:34:59,630
I got it.

3697
02:34:59,670 --> 02:34:59,870
Okay.

3698
02:35:00,530 --> 02:35:00,930
Okay.

3699
02:35:02,130 --> 02:35:06,410
Then I unequip and crawl out.

3700
02:35:07,130 --> 02:35:09,130
And stand up and equip.

3701
02:35:12,930 --> 02:35:13,770
Gonna get you, buddy.

3702
02:35:13,990 --> 02:35:14,390
Sorry.

3703
02:35:14,930 --> 02:35:15,590
Taking you out.

3704
02:35:16,770 --> 02:35:17,570
Oh, sorry.

3705
02:35:17,710 --> 02:35:18,110
I forgot to...

3706
02:35:20,030 --> 02:35:20,430
Okay.

3707
02:35:20,530 --> 02:35:21,690
Goodnight and...

3708
02:35:21,690 --> 02:35:22,670
Uh...

3709
02:35:22,670 --> 02:35:23,130
Uh...

3710
02:35:23,690 --> 02:35:24,130
Run.

3711
02:35:31,700 --> 02:35:32,220
Clean.

3712
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:37,960
Clean, clean, clean.

3713
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:45,160
Won't anybody take me to the nuke building?

3714
02:35:45,540 --> 02:35:46,060
Please.

3715
02:35:46,580 --> 02:35:49,200
I'm just a small box who wants to go to the nuke building.

3716
02:35:49,660 --> 02:35:51,060
Won't anyone take me there?

3717
02:35:51,220 --> 02:35:51,560
Yeah.

3718
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:53,740
Just a lot...

3719
02:35:53,740 --> 02:35:56,120
Just a hunk of junk.

3720
02:35:56,280 --> 02:35:56,920
That's what it is.

3721
02:36:00,140 --> 02:36:01,340
Yeah, there is a camera!

3722
02:36:02,300 --> 02:36:02,780
But...

3723
02:36:03,660 --> 02:36:06,000
It's easy to avoid, luckily, for that one.

3724
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:07,400
Toha!

3725
02:36:07,580 --> 02:36:08,340
Welcome to membership.

3726
02:36:08,540 --> 02:36:08,920
Thank you!

3727
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:12,580
Simple and clean, if you will.

3728
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:15,700
When you walk away...

3729
02:36:15,700 --> 02:36:18,580
You don't hear me say...

3730
02:36:20,840 --> 02:36:23,140
This might be a mistake, but...

3731
02:36:26,960 --> 02:36:27,360
Please.

3732
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:29,440
Oh, baby.

3733
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:31,220
Don't go.

3734
02:36:32,880 --> 02:36:35,260
Simple and clean is the way.

3735
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:36,240
Oh my gosh.

3736
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:39,100
I don't know if my voice is ever gonna recover, you guys.

3737
02:36:39,160 --> 02:36:39,680
It's so bad.

3738
02:36:40,580 --> 02:36:42,620
I wonder if my throat is ever going to recover.

3739
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:44,840
I think if I keep screaming, it definitely won't.

3740
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:45,320
But, you know.

3741
02:36:47,900 --> 02:36:51,000
If I keep yelling all the time, it won't, for sure.

3742
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:51,600
But, you know.

3743
02:36:53,340 --> 02:36:53,960
Oh my god.

3744
02:36:54,960 --> 02:36:55,360
Phew.

3745
02:37:12,050 --> 02:37:14,150
Give it time and take it easy will help a lot.

3746
02:37:14,410 --> 02:37:16,330
Yeah, I've been like drinking a lot of like...

3747
02:37:16,790 --> 02:37:18,450
Throat... like teas for your throat.

3748
02:37:18,730 --> 02:37:20,290
Actually, I have a different tea.

3749
02:37:20,390 --> 02:37:20,930
A throat tea.

3750
02:37:20,990 --> 02:37:21,530
I just remembered.

3751
02:37:21,850 --> 02:37:23,210
Okay, I'll start drinking that too.

3752
02:37:27,110 --> 02:37:28,770
And just kind of like...

3753
02:37:29,790 --> 02:37:31,530
Having cough drops and stuff.

3754
02:37:32,650 --> 02:37:33,090
Daily.

3755
02:37:34,870 --> 02:37:35,310
There

3756
02:37:39,940 --> 02:37:40,120
we go.

3757
02:37:40,260 --> 02:37:40,620
Nice.

3758
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:42,640
But...

3759
02:37:42,640 --> 02:37:43,720
I fear...

3760
02:37:43,720 --> 02:37:46,040
I actually have a genuine fear because like...

3761
02:37:46,040 --> 02:37:48,100
I can't hit high notes like I did before.

3762
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:49,500
I'm scared.

3763
02:37:52,700 --> 02:37:54,800
Maybe a vocal coach could help as well.

3764
02:37:55,500 --> 02:37:56,220
Maybe, yeah.

3765
02:37:56,220 --> 02:37:56,840
I was thinking...

3766
02:37:56,840 --> 02:37:57,780
I've been trying to like...

3767
02:37:57,780 --> 02:38:01,000
I was thinking or rather I was doing like some light vocal exercises.

3768
02:38:01,300 --> 02:38:03,400
But I don't want to like do so much.

3769
02:38:03,500 --> 02:38:05,960
And then make it worse on accident, you know.

3770
02:38:05,960 --> 02:38:07,280
So I'm kind of like...

3771
02:38:07,900 --> 02:38:08,820
What do I do?

3772
02:38:14,200 --> 02:38:15,100
He's gonna look over.

3773
02:38:34,480 --> 02:38:36,540
It was risky, but I took the risk.

3774
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:44,900
Do some hypnotherapy for your throat.

3775
02:38:49,900 --> 02:38:51,280
Lead singer of a band...

3776
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:51,500
Wait.

3777
02:38:51,700 --> 02:38:52,620
I went to the wrong one.

3778
02:38:52,740 --> 02:38:53,100
Again.

3779
02:38:53,900 --> 02:38:55,840
He broke a blood vessel and sing...

3780
02:38:55,840 --> 02:38:58,120
Wait, I can't tell if you're being serious or not.

3781
02:38:58,260 --> 02:38:58,680
He broke...

3782
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:00,880
Burst a blood vessel in his throat and now sings better than ever.

3783
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:01,640
What does that mean?

3784
02:39:01,820 --> 02:39:02,140
What are you...

3785
02:39:02,140 --> 02:39:02,940
Wait, is that real?

3786
02:39:04,720 --> 02:39:05,240
Oh,

3787
02:39:08,850 --> 02:39:10,150
I do have the level 6 card.

3788
02:39:11,870 --> 02:39:13,010
You're so right.

3789
02:39:13,770 --> 02:39:14,910
Wait, where was...

3790
02:39:14,910 --> 02:39:16,530
What was in...

3791
02:39:17,310 --> 02:39:18,150
What was...

3792
02:39:18,150 --> 02:39:19,950
Was there any level 6 down there?

3793
02:39:20,070 --> 02:39:20,610
I can't remember.

3794
02:39:20,930 --> 02:39:21,610
Let's try it though.

3795
02:39:22,410 --> 02:39:23,610
Is it pretty flimmy?

3796
02:39:24,410 --> 02:39:25,970
No, it's just like...

3797
02:39:27,270 --> 02:39:28,770
Raspier than usual.

3798
02:39:29,530 --> 02:39:30,590
Like if I...

3799
02:39:31,410 --> 02:39:31,930
Oh...

3800
02:39:31,930 --> 02:39:32,210
Oh...

3801
02:39:32,210 --> 02:39:32,350
Oh...

3802
02:39:32,350 --> 02:39:32,550
Oh...

3803
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:32,830
Oh...

3804
02:39:32,830 --> 02:39:32,850
Oh...

3805
02:39:32,850 --> 02:39:33,110
Oh...

3806
02:39:33,110 --> 02:39:33,310
Oh...

3807
02:39:34,990 --> 02:39:35,510
Oh...

3808
02:39:35,510 --> 02:39:35,530
Oh...

3809
02:39:35,530 --> 02:39:38,730
If I sing high, like sometimes I just can't hit the note.

3810
02:39:40,350 --> 02:39:41,770
All of these I can go into.

3811
02:39:42,010 --> 02:39:42,670
Yeah, 4.

3812
02:39:43,970 --> 02:39:45,190
That one I can go into.

3813
02:39:47,890 --> 02:39:48,490
This one.

3814
02:39:49,750 --> 02:39:50,550
This is 2.

3815
02:39:50,990 --> 02:39:51,750
It's this one.

3816
02:39:54,290 --> 02:39:55,410
I can't read.

3817
02:39:55,630 --> 02:39:55,930
6!

3818
02:39:59,350 --> 02:40:00,230
Body armor!

3819
02:40:03,580 --> 02:40:05,140
I think this one I was good to.

3820
02:40:05,660 --> 02:40:06,100
4.

3821
02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:06,400
Yeah.

3822
02:40:06,460 --> 02:40:06,780
Okay.

3823
02:40:07,300 --> 02:40:07,740
Okay.

3824
02:40:08,720 --> 02:40:11,380
Gosh, taking out the cameras and them staying out.

3825
02:40:11,400 --> 02:40:12,520
No one wants to come back here.

3826
02:40:12,580 --> 02:40:14,120
Of course they just keep the cameras dead.

3827
02:40:14,760 --> 02:40:15,540
It's awesome.

3828
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:23,680
Last time I had a bad cough, it took like 2 months to recover.

3829
02:40:23,920 --> 02:40:24,260
Oof.

3830
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:25,600
It was only...

3831
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:26,420
It wasn't a bad cough.

3832
02:40:26,540 --> 02:40:28,580
It was just that I lost my...

3833
02:40:29,060 --> 02:40:32,640
I had lost my voice from getting sick.

3834
02:40:33,180 --> 02:40:34,600
It just hasn't recovered since.

3835
02:40:36,320 --> 02:40:37,460
Oh, we can't see Otacon.

3836
02:40:38,300 --> 02:40:38,860
I mean...

3837
02:40:38,860 --> 02:40:41,100
Well, obviously, but we can't even see that area.

3838
02:40:52,040 --> 02:40:53,500
Sometimes it just takes time.

3839
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:55,180
I'll be patient then.

3840
02:40:58,560 --> 02:40:59,760
I will be patient.

3841
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:07,960
The commander is waiting for you, Mr. Foxhound.

3842
02:41:12,220 --> 02:41:13,260
Gosh, everything...

3843
02:41:14,960 --> 02:41:16,020
Meal ready to eat.

3844
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:17,320
Meal ready to eat.

3845
02:41:18,580 --> 02:41:21,740
Everything is like so, uh...

3846
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:24,660
So quick to respawn.

3847
02:41:25,620 --> 02:41:26,580
It's kind of awesome.

3848
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:29,560
Is there anything else in here?

3849
02:41:30,940 --> 02:41:32,380
My eardrums are rumbling.

3850
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:37,000
My eardrums are rumbling.

3851
02:41:37,740 --> 02:41:38,620
What's on there?

3852
02:41:40,660 --> 02:41:41,180
Nothing.

3853
02:41:43,060 --> 02:41:43,940
What if it was...

3854
02:41:43,940 --> 02:41:44,380
Can you imagine?

3855
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:45,640
What if it was like Newgrounds?

3856
02:41:46,020 --> 02:41:46,540
Something like that.

3857
02:41:47,080 --> 02:41:49,260
Like Psycho Mantis, what are you... what are you... what are you doing?

3858
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:51,040
Okay.

3859
02:41:54,760 --> 02:41:55,440
Doge meet.

3860
02:41:55,800 --> 02:41:56,660
Welcome to membership.

3861
02:41:56,860 --> 02:41:57,440
Thank you!

3862
02:42:06,220 --> 02:42:07,020
Hello, dog.

3863
02:42:08,820 --> 02:42:09,340
Oh, wait.

3864
02:42:14,780 --> 02:42:17,900
Oh, this is the tranquilizer.

3865
02:42:17,980 --> 02:42:18,780
We don't need any of this.

3866
02:42:20,540 --> 02:42:21,400
Oh, up here.

3867
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:23,900
Yes, yes.

3868
02:42:24,400 --> 02:42:25,120
Excuse me.

3869
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:26,100
Excuse me, pup.

3870
02:42:26,700 --> 02:42:27,760
Excuse me, little... oh, wait.

3871
02:42:29,540 --> 02:42:30,620
Oh, it's this one, right?

3872
02:42:31,900 --> 02:42:33,760
Oh, I have all... I have full?

3873
02:42:33,920 --> 02:42:34,180
Okay.

3874
02:42:35,800 --> 02:42:36,880
Is there a dog in here?

3875
02:42:44,090 --> 02:42:45,570
Sound Rouge, welcome to membership.

3876
02:42:46,230 --> 02:42:48,970
Neils, thank you for the 20 gifts and thank you so much.

3877
02:42:50,370 --> 02:42:51,210
Thank you, thank you.

3878
02:42:58,720 --> 02:42:59,980
Oh my god, Meryl's blood.

3879
02:43:08,240 --> 02:43:09,700
Snake, you're still sick?

3880
02:43:13,340 --> 02:43:14,060
Wait,

3881
02:43:19,210 --> 02:43:19,450
what?

3882
02:43:21,850 --> 02:43:23,570
My trauma is happening.

3883
02:43:30,610 --> 02:43:31,850
Oh my god.

3884
02:43:32,210 --> 02:43:33,370
Oh god.

3885
02:43:35,430 --> 02:43:36,210
My trauma.

3886
02:43:41,670 --> 02:43:42,130
I can help you.

3887
02:43:42,530 --> 02:43:43,510
Quiet down.

3888
02:43:43,730 --> 02:43:44,970
Save your strength.

3889
02:43:47,130 --> 02:43:48,990
I was a fool.

3890
02:43:49,950 --> 02:43:51,910
I wanted to be a soldier.

3891
02:43:53,730 --> 02:43:54,410
Meryl.

3892
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:57,710
War is meaningless.

3893
02:43:58,170 --> 02:43:58,850
Meryl.

3894
02:43:58,930 --> 02:44:00,590
Nothing comes out of war.

3895
02:44:02,310 --> 02:44:04,270
You got a husband out of war.

3896
02:44:04,590 --> 02:44:06,270
Please, save yourself.

3897
02:44:07,090 --> 02:44:10,210
Go on living and don't give up on people.

3898
02:44:13,830 --> 02:44:14,850
Don't forget me.

3899
02:44:15,790 --> 02:44:17,970
This doesn't happen if you save her, right?

3900
02:44:29,160 --> 02:44:30,600
Snake, about Meryl.

3901
02:44:31,700 --> 02:44:32,140
Colonel.

3902
02:44:32,320 --> 02:44:33,200
I'm sorry, Colonel.

3903
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:33,700
I'm sorry.

3904
02:44:34,400 --> 02:44:35,180
Listen to me.

3905
02:44:35,240 --> 02:44:35,880
Oh, it does still happen.

3906
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:38,400
I wasn't able to protect her.

3907
02:44:38,400 --> 02:44:39,740
No, I don't think so.

3908
02:44:39,800 --> 02:44:41,300
Snake, it's okay.

3909
02:44:41,940 --> 02:44:43,120
You did what you could.

3910
02:44:43,240 --> 02:44:44,320
Now let it rest.

3911
02:44:44,880 --> 02:44:45,320
Colonel.

3912
02:44:45,580 --> 02:44:47,620
She joined up of her own free will.

3913
02:44:48,140 --> 02:44:49,900
I'm sure she was prepared for this.

3914
02:44:50,200 --> 02:44:51,940
No, you're wrong.

3915
02:44:54,400 --> 02:44:56,360
Meryl thought she had to become a soldier.

3916
02:44:56,620 --> 02:44:57,940
Thought it was the only way.

3917
02:44:58,560 --> 02:45:01,460
She said she thought it would bring her closer to her dead father.

3918
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:03,260
She said that?

3919
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:05,880
She wasn't ready for real combat.

3920
02:45:06,260 --> 02:45:08,040
I shouldn't have pushed her so hard.

3921
02:45:08,220 --> 02:45:08,560
No.

3922
02:45:08,740 --> 02:45:09,620
It's all my fault.

3923
02:45:10,020 --> 02:45:11,320
That's not like you, Snake.

3924
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:11,980
Master.

3925
02:45:12,480 --> 02:45:13,240
What is it?

3926
02:45:13,320 --> 02:45:14,060
Master Miller.

3927
02:45:14,060 --> 02:45:15,000
Sorry for eavesdropping.

3928
02:45:15,320 --> 02:45:15,920
But I couldn't just listen anymore.

3929
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:17,100
Master Miller jumpscare.

3930
02:45:17,100 --> 02:45:17,820
Master.

3931
02:45:18,440 --> 02:45:20,900
Snake, you can have regrets if you want to.

3932
02:45:21,020 --> 02:45:21,940
It's only natural.

3933
02:45:22,220 --> 02:45:25,860
But you can't keep attacking yourself for things that happened in the past.

3934
02:45:26,360 --> 02:45:28,020
Nothing good will come from that.

3935
02:45:28,260 --> 02:45:28,900
He's right.

3936
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:29,860
Don't kick yourself.

3937
02:45:30,140 --> 02:45:32,420
It doesn't suit a legend like you.

3938
02:45:32,820 --> 02:45:35,700
And besides that, for all we know, Meryl's okay, right?

3939
02:45:35,880 --> 02:45:36,300
Oh, right.

3940
02:45:36,340 --> 02:45:36,840
Okay.

3941
02:45:38,140 --> 02:45:40,020
Snake, forget about Meryl.

3942
02:45:40,360 --> 02:45:41,360
Stop Liquid.

3943
02:45:42,320 --> 02:45:44,120
That's what Meryl would want too.

3944
02:45:44,120 --> 02:45:45,060
You're right.

3945
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:46,380
They do talk about her like she's dead, though.

3946
02:45:46,380 --> 02:45:47,080
Meryl would say the same thing.

3947
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:47,940
Snake.

3948
02:45:48,260 --> 02:45:48,700
What?

3949
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:50,440
Meryl.

3950
02:45:50,440 --> 02:45:51,900
She's pretty special to you, huh?

3951
02:45:53,380 --> 02:45:54,260
Well, yeah.

3952
02:45:54,820 --> 02:45:55,260
Special.

3953
02:45:55,540 --> 02:45:56,560
Master is such a good guy.

3954
02:45:56,560 --> 02:45:56,860
Yeah.

3955
02:45:56,860 --> 02:45:58,100
There aren't many tomboys like her.

3956
02:45:58,720 --> 02:45:59,160
Tomboys?

3957
02:45:59,200 --> 02:45:59,840
That's not what I meant.

3958
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:01,840
She's the Colonel's niece.

3959
02:46:02,080 --> 02:46:03,400
And a combat buddy.

3960
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:04,560
Oh my god, combat buddy!

3961
02:46:05,180 --> 02:46:05,700
Come on.

3962
02:46:05,860 --> 02:46:07,800
This is like a police interrogation.

3963
02:46:08,120 --> 02:46:09,200
No, I just...

3964
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:11,100
I guess it's in the genes.

3965
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:12,360
The genes?

3966
02:46:12,360 --> 02:46:12,680
What do you mean?

3967
02:46:12,680 --> 02:46:14,400
What are you talking about, Colonel?

3968
02:46:14,500 --> 02:46:14,800
Tomboy love?

3969
02:46:15,860 --> 02:46:18,780
No, I just remembered about Naomi's grandfather.

3970
02:46:19,460 --> 02:46:25,680
I think Naomi said he rose as high as assistant secretary in the FBI during Edgar Hoover's time.

3971
02:46:26,060 --> 02:46:27,100
Is that right?

3972
02:46:27,700 --> 02:46:28,140
Yes.

3973
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:29,120
Yes.

3974
02:46:29,700 --> 02:46:31,100
He was Japanese.

3975
02:46:31,440 --> 02:46:34,740
And he became a special undercover investigator to nab the mafia.

3976
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:35,220
Uh, lie.

3977
02:46:35,320 --> 02:46:35,820
When was that?

3978
02:46:36,460 --> 02:46:38,400
Master Miller clocking her lies.

3979
02:46:38,660 --> 02:46:39,180
Where?

3980
02:46:39,580 --> 02:46:40,100
Oh!

3981
02:46:40,120 --> 02:46:40,980
New York, I think?

3982
02:46:40,980 --> 02:46:41,180
Yeah!

3983
02:46:41,460 --> 02:46:41,880
Go!

3984
02:46:41,980 --> 02:46:42,840
Go, Master, go!

3985
02:46:43,400 --> 02:46:44,940
I thought that you didn't have any family.

3986
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:45,280
Oh!

3987
02:46:45,720 --> 02:46:47,500
I researched it after I became an adult.

3988
02:46:48,100 --> 02:46:51,100
My grandfather was already dead by the time I learned about him.

3989
02:46:51,660 --> 02:46:53,560
I never even had the chance to meet him.

3990
02:46:53,820 --> 02:46:54,320
Don't...

3991
02:46:54,820 --> 02:46:56,560
She's making an all sob story.

3992
02:46:57,300 --> 02:46:57,640
Good luck.

3993
02:46:57,960 --> 02:46:59,200
Watch your back, Snake.

3994
02:47:02,460 --> 02:47:06,420
Master Miller is like sniffing her out.

3995
02:47:07,160 --> 02:47:08,280
I love that.

3996
02:47:12,730 --> 02:47:13,030
Keep through!

3997
02:47:13,470 --> 02:47:17,230
Just imagine Snake David Hayter trying to do a British accent to infiltrate his liquid.

3998
02:47:19,710 --> 02:47:20,710
I'm telling you, though.

3999
02:47:21,550 --> 02:47:22,470
Oh, bless you.

4000
02:47:22,650 --> 02:47:24,590
He sneezes so much more in this area.

4001
02:47:24,770 --> 02:47:25,290
It's kind of weird.

4002
02:47:25,870 --> 02:47:26,830
K-Barn, thank you!

4003
02:47:27,050 --> 02:47:29,430
Wait, oh, my donos are kind of weird.

4004
02:47:30,070 --> 02:47:30,870
There we go.

4005
02:47:33,270 --> 02:47:39,530
The problem with you being on the team is the second Snake flirted with you, you'd scream, hang up with Kodak, and never call again.

4006
02:47:42,070 --> 02:47:42,510
Oh!

4007
02:47:43,150 --> 02:47:43,830
Bless you.

4008
02:47:45,710 --> 02:47:47,010
Don't say that.

4009
02:47:50,820 --> 02:47:51,380
Ah!

4010
02:47:51,620 --> 02:47:52,580
Oh yeah, blah blah.

4011
02:47:52,860 --> 02:47:54,380
I'm gonna try and shoot this one down.

4012
02:48:04,820 --> 02:48:05,540
There we go.

4013
02:48:06,740 --> 02:48:08,640
Oh wait, my rations are full anyway.

4014
02:48:09,740 --> 02:48:10,720
There's only this one?

4015
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:12,080
Okay.

4016
02:48:13,300 --> 02:48:13,860
Nice.

4017
02:48:15,260 --> 02:48:15,820
Achoo!

4018
02:48:17,300 --> 02:48:17,860
Achoo!

4019
02:48:19,280 --> 02:48:19,840
Achoo!

4020
02:48:20,120 --> 02:48:20,420
Hahaha.

4021
02:48:21,260 --> 02:48:21,820
Achoo!

4022
02:48:24,360 --> 02:48:25,760
I can't wait for the call.

4023
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:29,280
I can't wait for the call where he's just like, that girl is weird.

4024
02:48:29,580 --> 02:48:31,500
That girl is not normal.

4025
02:48:31,720 --> 02:48:32,740
That girl...

4026
02:48:36,710 --> 02:48:37,950
That girl is...

4027
02:48:39,210 --> 02:48:39,950
Telling lies.

4028
02:48:43,450 --> 02:48:44,570
Where's a little rat?

4029
02:48:46,390 --> 02:48:47,510
Where's a little rat?

4030
02:48:47,630 --> 02:48:49,370
I'm gonna take down a little rat.

4031
02:48:50,310 --> 02:48:51,170
Oh, there is one!

4032
02:48:51,270 --> 02:48:51,490
There's one!

4033
02:49:00,250 --> 02:49:00,930
There we go!

4034
02:49:02,890 --> 02:49:03,290
Oh!

4035
02:49:04,130 --> 02:49:04,530
Oh!

4036
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:08,860
I gotta put in the other disc.

4037
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:09,640
Hold on, you guys.

4038
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:12,440
Yippee!

4039
02:49:13,380 --> 02:49:15,020
Time to change the disc, everyone!

4040
02:49:18,360 --> 02:49:19,240
Take it out.

4041
02:49:19,900 --> 02:49:21,280
And let me put it in...

4042
02:49:21,280 --> 02:49:22,220
Let me grab the other one.

4043
02:49:22,400 --> 02:49:22,420
Oh.

4044
02:49:23,220 --> 02:49:23,620
Okay.

4045
02:49:24,080 --> 02:49:24,480
Okay.

4046
02:49:25,360 --> 02:49:25,760
My...

4047
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:27,880
The first disc, unfortunately, has some, like, damage.

4048
02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:29,060
It's kind of, like, cracked a little.

4049
02:49:31,800 --> 02:49:32,200
Okay!

4050
02:49:32,320 --> 02:49:32,360
I got it!

4051
02:49:32,360 --> 02:49:32,480
Okay!

4052
02:49:33,180 --> 02:49:33,580
Disc...

4053
02:49:35,780 --> 02:49:36,180
Wait.

4054
02:49:36,300 --> 02:49:37,000
For some reason...

4055
02:49:38,200 --> 02:49:38,600
Wait.

4056
02:49:38,820 --> 02:49:40,640
I always thought that disc two...

4057
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:41,000
Wait.

4058
02:49:41,180 --> 02:49:43,560
Otacon is supposed to tell you to change the discs, isn't he?

4059
02:49:44,180 --> 02:49:45,820
I thought it was after...

4060
02:49:48,220 --> 02:49:50,440
I could have sworn it was after...

4061
02:49:55,790 --> 02:49:56,590
After Sniperwolf.

4062
02:49:57,850 --> 02:49:58,250
Hmm.

4063
02:50:00,510 --> 02:50:01,710
Oh, it's just in MGS4.

4064
02:50:02,110 --> 02:50:02,510
Wow.

4065
02:50:03,310 --> 02:50:03,950
Wait, hold on.

4066
02:50:04,110 --> 02:50:05,290
I am gonna call people, though.

4067
02:50:05,750 --> 02:50:06,150
Okay.

4068
02:50:06,150 --> 02:50:06,230
Okay.

4069
02:50:06,270 --> 02:50:07,250
Let's see where we're at.

4070
02:50:09,650 --> 02:50:10,130
Snake.

4071
02:50:10,530 --> 02:50:13,810
The launch deadline for the new nuclear warhead is almost here.

4072
02:50:13,850 --> 02:50:14,510
The new nuclear?

4073
02:50:15,030 --> 02:50:17,270
And get to Metal Gear's underground maintenance base.

4074
02:50:17,630 --> 02:50:18,270
I'm getting there.

4075
02:50:18,290 --> 02:50:20,130
The overland route is blocked by a glacier.

4076
02:50:20,670 --> 02:50:23,390
Climb the communications tower so you can go over it.

4077
02:50:23,510 --> 02:50:24,050
Got it.

4078
02:50:24,190 --> 02:50:28,070
The communications towers consist of Tower A and Tower B.

4079
02:50:28,130 --> 02:50:28,310
Wait.

4080
02:50:28,310 --> 02:50:29,970
Do I even need chaff grenades here?

4081
02:50:30,030 --> 02:50:30,050
You're in Tower A now.

4082
02:50:30,210 --> 02:50:33,950
To get to Tower B, you'll have to use the outside walkway.

4083
02:50:34,390 --> 02:50:35,310
Remember, Snake.

4084
02:50:35,630 --> 02:50:36,230
Dark power.

4085
02:50:36,250 --> 02:50:37,670
Dark places are dangerous places.

4086
02:50:37,930 --> 02:50:40,070
You can't see where your enemies are coming from.

4087
02:50:40,310 --> 02:50:43,230
Please use your night vision goggles or your thermal goggles.

4088
02:50:43,710 --> 02:50:44,230
This technically is after Sniperwolf.

4089
02:50:44,230 --> 02:50:46,230
They loaded part one with more cutscenes.

4090
02:50:46,490 --> 02:50:47,850
Ah, I see, see, see.

4091
02:50:48,330 --> 02:50:52,310
Because I was like, you fight, you kill Sniperwolf, and then you change it, right?

4092
02:50:52,450 --> 02:50:52,790
Or...

4093
02:50:56,550 --> 02:50:57,430
No response?

4094
02:50:58,070 --> 02:50:58,590
What?

4095
02:50:58,590 --> 02:50:59,530
Where are you?

4096
02:51:00,650 --> 02:51:02,390
Where are you, Master Miller?

4097
02:51:05,190 --> 02:51:07,850
Snake, it's dark inside the communication tower.

4098
02:51:07,910 --> 02:51:10,830
You should use your night vision or thermal goggles.

4099
02:51:11,090 --> 02:51:14,970
If you want thermal goggles, there's a pair on the same floor as my lab.

4100
02:51:15,210 --> 02:51:16,270
Be careful.

4101
02:51:16,510 --> 02:51:20,030
There are always a lot of soldiers guarding the communication towers.

4102
02:51:20,370 --> 02:51:23,570
The walkway is directly between the communication towers.

4103
02:51:23,810 --> 02:51:24,670
Head for there.

4104
02:51:25,690 --> 02:51:27,910
Don't tell me to use thermal goggles.

4105
02:51:29,670 --> 02:51:31,270
Not you too, Otacon.

4106
02:51:31,290 --> 02:51:31,730
Who is it, Snake?

4107
02:51:33,490 --> 02:51:35,010
Not you too.

4108
02:51:38,330 --> 02:51:40,050
Let's just save, just in case.

4109
02:51:42,890 --> 02:51:45,930
You know I'm the worst, though, at calling Nastasha all the time.

4110
02:51:45,950 --> 02:51:47,990
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.

4111
02:51:48,430 --> 02:51:50,230
Old time is still a-flying.

4112
02:51:50,590 --> 02:51:55,110
And this same flower that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying.

4113
02:51:56,130 --> 02:51:58,090
Snake, laughter is the best medicine.

4114
02:51:58,370 --> 02:52:00,910
You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game.

4115
02:52:01,330 --> 02:52:02,550
Enjoy yourself, okay?

4116
02:52:04,050 --> 02:52:04,990
Thank you.

4117
02:52:05,010 --> 02:52:05,490
Thanks for anything.

4118
02:52:09,930 --> 02:52:10,370
Thanks.

4119
02:52:10,390 --> 02:52:14,470
When you're in a dark place, you should use night vision or thermal goggles.

4120
02:52:14,570 --> 02:52:16,110
Is it really that dark in- Oh, okay.

4121
02:52:16,610 --> 02:52:18,170
Is it really that dark in here?

4122
02:52:18,410 --> 02:52:18,990
Or am I...

4123
02:52:20,650 --> 02:52:22,170
I feel like I'm being...

4124
02:52:22,870 --> 02:52:23,310
Like...

4125
02:52:23,950 --> 02:52:25,150
I feel like I'm being...

4126
02:52:25,150 --> 02:52:26,370
Like, gaslit.

4127
02:52:26,450 --> 02:52:27,690
I can see perfectly fine.

4128
02:52:28,450 --> 02:52:29,430
Is it that dark?

4129
02:52:32,450 --> 02:52:32,950
Eek.

4130
02:52:33,550 --> 02:52:34,050
The

4131
02:52:47,130 --> 02:52:49,010
night vision goggles did not pick that up.

4132
02:52:50,470 --> 02:52:50,970
So...

4133
02:52:55,720 --> 02:52:56,780
Thanks a whole lot.

4134
02:52:58,640 --> 02:52:59,760
Thanks a whole lot.

4135
02:53:01,980 --> 02:53:02,480
Umm...

4136
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:04,360
Oh, my God...

4137
02:53:10,420 --> 02:53:11,720
Oh, this is this part.

4138
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:14,800
Just go, Snake.

4139
02:53:14,920 --> 02:53:15,480
Just go.

4140
02:53:16,380 --> 02:53:17,660
Just run, Snake.

4141
02:53:17,720 --> 02:53:18,340
Just run.

4142
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:18,620
Run!

4143
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:24,640
Just run, Snake!

4144
02:53:25,160 --> 02:53:27,340
Just go, Snake!

4145
02:53:32,940 --> 02:53:34,140
It's kind of...

4146
02:53:34,140 --> 02:53:34,680
Come on!

4147
02:53:34,960 --> 02:53:36,000
Oh my god.

4148
02:53:36,060 --> 02:53:36,340
Ouch!

4149
02:53:37,140 --> 02:53:38,620
Turn this way.

4150
02:53:42,460 --> 02:53:44,220
Look up, Snake!

4151
02:53:45,180 --> 02:53:45,720
There we go.

4152
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:46,200
Go!

4153
02:53:47,400 --> 02:53:48,920
I enjoy all the killing!

4154
02:53:50,040 --> 02:53:50,440
Killing!

4155
02:53:50,560 --> 02:53:50,700
Killing!

4156
02:53:50,740 --> 02:53:51,080
Killing!

4157
02:53:51,080 --> 02:53:51,400
Killing!

4158
02:53:51,460 --> 02:53:51,860
Killing!

4159
02:53:54,500 --> 02:53:54,900
Killing!

4160
02:53:54,940 --> 02:53:55,340
Killing!

4161
02:53:55,340 --> 02:53:55,380
Killing!

4162
02:53:56,640 --> 02:53:58,360
Oh my god.

4163
02:53:58,420 --> 02:53:59,380
They come from behind me too?

4164
02:54:02,380 --> 02:54:02,780
Launch!

4165
02:54:03,560 --> 02:54:04,220
Oh my god.

4166
02:54:04,260 --> 02:54:06,880
He can't throw it because they keep shooting at me.

4167
02:54:08,180 --> 02:54:08,760
Thank you!

4168
02:54:12,740 --> 02:54:14,420
Oh, it did go off.

4169
02:54:15,720 --> 02:54:16,500
Oh my god.

4170
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:17,840
No.

4171
02:54:20,760 --> 02:54:22,700
I'm trying to auto-aim at no one.

4172
02:54:22,900 --> 02:54:23,720
Oh my god.

4173
02:54:25,320 --> 02:54:25,720
Please.

4174
02:54:28,360 --> 02:54:28,860
Hey, dude.

4175
02:54:29,480 --> 02:54:30,040
Uh-oh.

4176
02:54:33,160 --> 02:54:34,220
Oh my gosh.

4177
02:54:36,680 --> 02:54:37,440
Oh my gosh.

4178
02:54:37,600 --> 02:54:38,420
Oh my gosh.

4179
02:54:39,580 --> 02:54:40,380
Oh my gosh!

4180
02:54:40,760 --> 02:54:41,160
Please!

4181
02:54:42,160 --> 02:54:43,100
Right in the crotch!

4182
02:54:43,800 --> 02:54:44,200
Yeah!

4183
02:54:44,220 --> 02:54:44,620
Oh my god.

4184
02:54:44,660 --> 02:54:45,560
Just run, Snake.

4185
02:54:45,840 --> 02:54:46,240
Jeez!

4186
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:47,560
Just go!

4187
02:54:48,340 --> 02:54:48,880
Just run!

4188
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:49,620
Oh my gosh.

4189
02:54:49,720 --> 02:54:50,260
Oh my gosh.

4190
02:54:50,280 --> 02:54:51,160
You were so obnoxious.

4191
02:54:51,420 --> 02:54:52,780
How do you have such good aim?

4192
02:54:54,940 --> 02:54:55,580
Oh my god.

4193
02:54:55,640 --> 02:54:56,160
I'm gonna...

4194
02:54:56,160 --> 02:54:57,760
Oh my gosh!

4195
02:55:00,400 --> 02:55:00,800
What?

4196
02:55:09,070 --> 02:55:09,670
Okay, nice.

4197
02:55:10,190 --> 02:55:10,730
Just kill.

4198
02:55:10,810 --> 02:55:11,150
Go, go, go.

4199
02:55:50,580 --> 02:55:51,320
This is irrational.

4200
02:55:51,560 --> 02:55:51,940
Oh my god.

4201
02:55:51,980 --> 02:55:52,400
It didn't work.

4202
02:55:53,960 --> 02:55:55,020
Oh, I'm stuck!

4203
02:55:55,700 --> 02:55:56,100
Wait.

4204
02:55:56,140 --> 02:55:56,800
I'm actually stuck!

4205
02:55:59,060 --> 02:55:59,720
Oh my god.

4206
02:55:59,740 --> 02:55:59,920
Please.

4207
02:56:02,380 --> 02:56:02,780
Wait.

4208
02:56:02,900 --> 02:56:03,240
Eh?

4209
02:56:03,560 --> 02:56:03,960
Eh?

4210
02:56:04,500 --> 02:56:04,900
Eh?

4211
02:56:04,900 --> 02:56:05,300
Eh?

4212
02:56:05,300 --> 02:56:05,540
Eh?

4213
02:56:18,660 --> 02:56:19,120
Hey, dude.

4214
02:56:19,320 --> 02:56:19,660
Uh-oh.

4215
02:56:19,780 --> 02:56:20,180
Wait.

4216
02:56:20,320 --> 02:56:20,460
Eh?

4217
02:56:20,880 --> 02:56:21,020
Eh?

4218
02:56:21,380 --> 02:56:21,540
Eh?

4219
02:56:31,680 --> 02:56:32,320
There's a ladder?

4220
02:56:42,390 --> 02:56:43,490
Oh, I see it.

4221
02:56:43,590 --> 02:56:43,930
I see it.

4222
02:56:43,970 --> 02:56:44,250
I see it.

4223
02:56:45,150 --> 02:56:46,130
Thank you, guys.

4224
02:56:48,630 --> 02:56:50,550
Let's just regain our health a little bit.

4225
02:56:53,110 --> 02:56:55,670
Because I remember the other door is stuck, right?

4226
02:56:55,750 --> 02:56:57,630
It's frozen shut so you can't get to it.

4227
02:57:01,780 --> 02:57:02,640
What a thrill.

4228
02:57:09,800 --> 02:57:12,320
Yeah, so that's why I remember running just past it.

4229
02:57:12,420 --> 02:57:12,800
I was like...

4230
02:57:13,760 --> 02:57:14,720
It's time.

4231
02:57:17,280 --> 02:57:18,300
It's time.

4232
02:57:18,440 --> 02:57:19,000
It's time.

4233
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:19,380
It's time.

4234
02:57:19,380 --> 02:57:20,240
It's quiet up here.

4235
02:57:23,880 --> 02:57:24,960
I am.

4236
02:57:28,140 --> 02:57:29,180
He's so cool.

4237
02:57:29,480 --> 02:57:30,860
I'm monitoring you closely.

4238
02:57:31,060 --> 02:57:33,460
Your heart rate is elevated and your breathing is shallow.

4239
02:57:34,720 --> 02:57:35,980
What's the matter, Snake?

4240
02:57:35,980 --> 02:57:38,880
Snake, you're out of shape from all that dog mushing?

4241
02:57:39,460 --> 02:57:41,860
Then, climb down and proceed north.

4242
02:57:44,520 --> 02:57:45,680
You're out of shape?

4243
02:57:46,300 --> 02:57:48,040
Now, automated response.

4244
02:57:58,740 --> 02:58:00,260
Why do you say it like that?

4245
02:58:00,320 --> 02:58:00,860
I know, right?

4246
02:58:01,220 --> 02:58:02,400
What are you doing, Master?

4247
02:58:02,580 --> 02:58:03,360
Why won't you pick up?

4248
02:58:05,980 --> 02:58:07,460
Otacon, I'm up on the roof.

4249
02:58:07,680 --> 02:58:09,160
That was a pretty fast climb.

4250
02:58:09,160 --> 02:58:09,680
Yeah.

4251
02:58:09,960 --> 02:58:13,600
I wanted to go slowly, but someone there forced me to move faster.

4252
02:58:13,960 --> 02:58:14,400
Oh, gosh.

4253
02:58:15,420 --> 02:58:18,420
Well, you can relax because there's an elevator in Tower B.

4254
02:58:18,560 --> 02:58:18,880
Good.

4255
02:58:18,920 --> 02:58:21,020
That walkway will take you to Tower B.

4256
02:58:21,220 --> 02:58:21,600
Oh, thank goodness.

4257
02:58:21,820 --> 02:58:25,620
Surely there won't be anything like in the elevator or anything.

4258
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:27,140
We'll just go down.

4259
02:58:27,260 --> 02:58:29,820
We'll just go all the way down and we'll relax while doing it, you know?

4260
02:58:30,420 --> 02:58:31,220
Oh, my gosh.

4261
02:58:31,600 --> 02:58:32,000
Sorry.

4262
02:58:32,100 --> 02:58:34,220
I'm like, it keeps kind of stretching because my...

4263
02:58:35,440 --> 02:58:35,840
So...

4264
02:58:37,800 --> 02:58:38,800
Not last night.

4265
02:58:38,840 --> 02:58:39,700
The night before last.

4266
02:58:41,260 --> 02:58:47,420
When I was sleeping, my cat, he was sleeping next to me and he started to throw up.

4267
02:58:47,600 --> 02:58:50,260
And like you can hear when a cat is about to throw up, they do like the...

4268
02:58:51,020 --> 02:58:51,580
You know?

4269
02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:53,860
And I like woke up and I was like, no!

4270
02:58:54,140 --> 02:58:56,760
Because he was face... he was looking directly at me.

4271
02:58:56,820 --> 02:58:59,700
And if I hadn't woken up, he would have just thrown up all over my face.

4272
02:58:59,860 --> 02:59:05,820
And so I quickly pick him up and I like try to gently get him off of my bed.

4273
02:59:05,820 --> 02:59:06,960
But I slip.

4274
02:59:08,080 --> 02:59:09,600
I slip and I...

4275
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:13,660
Right next to my bed, I have a cat tower for him because he likes to climb it.

4276
02:59:14,500 --> 02:59:16,520
And I slip and I...

4277
02:59:17,140 --> 02:59:21,840
I bash my head into the corner of the... of the cat tower.

4278
02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:25,400
I'm like... I have like a little... like a little... like...

4279
02:59:25,400 --> 02:59:29,220
I have a bump on my head from where I... from where I hit and on my nose.

4280
02:59:29,280 --> 02:59:30,100
You can't really see it.

4281
02:59:30,500 --> 02:59:32,220
Only if I zoom in, you can see it.

4282
02:59:32,320 --> 02:59:34,700
But I have... like I cut my nose.

4283
02:59:34,700 --> 02:59:38,100
And I pulled something in my leg.

4284
02:59:38,240 --> 02:59:40,160
And like I... it was just a huge mess.

4285
02:59:40,360 --> 02:59:41,720
It was like 3 in the morning.

4286
02:59:41,900 --> 02:59:44,760
And I'm like... I had to... I literally like launched him.

4287
02:59:44,800 --> 02:59:46,760
I felt so bad because he was like throwing up.

4288
02:59:46,760 --> 02:59:47,460
He's not feeling well.

4289
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:48,680
And so I like launched him.

4290
02:59:48,800 --> 02:59:51,040
And I like fell out of bed.

4291
02:59:51,260 --> 02:59:53,640
And like so... now I'm so sore because of it.

4292
02:59:55,520 --> 02:59:57,980
Like my neck is so sore.

4293
02:59:58,020 --> 02:59:59,200
You wouldn't think like that.

4294
02:59:59,260 --> 03:00:00,820
Because like... I don't know.

4295
03:00:00,840 --> 03:00:03,080
Maybe I need to like work my ectoplasm a little bit more.

4296
03:00:05,500 --> 03:00:06,760
Luckily, you're already dead.

4297
03:00:06,860 --> 03:00:07,660
I know, right?

4298
03:00:07,940 --> 03:00:08,600
I know.

4299
03:00:09,080 --> 03:00:10,520
Otherwise, I would have been in a big trouble.

4300
03:00:11,120 --> 03:00:12,120
And it was so close.

4301
03:00:12,160 --> 03:00:16,580
It was so close to like hitting the corner of the cat tower into my eye.

4302
03:00:16,740 --> 03:00:18,040
It was... I was like...

4303
03:00:18,040 --> 03:00:18,480
Oh my gosh.

4304
03:00:18,520 --> 03:00:19,140
I'm such a mess.

4305
03:00:19,280 --> 03:00:20,360
It was such a mess.

4306
03:00:20,520 --> 03:00:21,220
I'm such a mess.

4307
03:00:21,880 --> 03:00:23,260
Marilyn, thanks for the five gifted.

4308
03:00:25,240 --> 03:00:25,600
Anyway.

4309
03:00:26,340 --> 03:00:27,340
Who else was I calling?

4310
03:00:27,820 --> 03:00:28,540
Um... Nastasha.

4311
03:00:29,560 --> 03:00:30,880
I wonder how Deep Throat's doing.

4312
03:00:31,160 --> 03:00:32,980
I wonder who that guy is.

4313
03:00:36,060 --> 03:00:36,560
Hmm.

4314
03:00:42,200 --> 03:00:44,060
You were gonna have an eye patch.

4315
03:00:47,060 --> 03:00:48,820
It was my left...

4316
03:00:49,470 --> 03:00:51,760
My left eye, so...

4317
03:00:52,820 --> 03:00:54,620
I would have been... solidus.

4318
03:00:54,780 --> 03:00:55,280
No.

4319
03:00:56,820 --> 03:00:58,280
Yeah, I would have been solidus.

4320
03:00:58,280 --> 03:00:59,000
It was my left eye.

4321
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:08,740
Did I save?

4322
03:01:09,120 --> 03:01:09,880
I don't think I did.

4323
03:01:10,060 --> 03:01:10,920
We'll do it just in case.

4324
03:01:11,020 --> 03:01:11,620
What is it, Snake?

4325
03:01:12,380 --> 03:01:13,400
Talk to you later, Snake.

4326
03:01:13,660 --> 03:01:13,960
Oh, sorry.

4327
03:01:14,200 --> 03:01:14,600
I know.

4328
03:01:17,400 --> 03:01:18,120
Typical politician.

4329
03:01:18,440 --> 03:01:19,120
Of course.

4330
03:01:20,280 --> 03:01:20,860
Of course.

4331
03:01:24,160 --> 03:01:24,700
Beep, beep.

4332
03:01:30,480 --> 03:01:30,840
Okay.

4333
03:01:31,580 --> 03:01:32,240
What do you mean?

4334
03:01:32,400 --> 03:01:34,700
What do you mean, President Mint?

4335
03:01:36,100 --> 03:01:37,840
No, I said I would be solidus.

4336
03:01:37,840 --> 03:01:39,900
George Sears is the president, you guys.

4337
03:01:40,320 --> 03:01:40,680
I'm sorry.

4338
03:01:40,680 --> 03:01:43,520
in paradise lost.

4339
03:01:43,900 --> 03:01:50,880
Milton wrote, solitude sometimes is best society and short retirement urges sweet return sweet return.

4340
03:01:50,920 --> 03:01:51,880
That why you came back, Snake.

4341
03:01:52,120 --> 03:01:54,580
You got tired of your short retirement in Alaska?

4342
03:01:54,780 --> 03:01:55,000
Huh?

4343
03:01:55,040 --> 03:01:59,520
No, I was actually dragged here, Mei Ling.

4344
03:02:00,060 --> 03:02:01,060
Let's not get it.

4345
03:02:01,100 --> 03:02:02,900
Let's not romanticize my kidnapping.

4346
03:02:04,480 --> 03:02:06,480
Let's not romanticize how this happened.

4347
03:02:09,020 --> 03:02:10,060
Just kidding.

4348
03:02:10,060 --> 03:02:10,300
I'm still going to get you a drink.

4349
03:02:16,980 --> 03:02:18,360
It's kind of spooky.

4350
03:02:25,380 --> 03:02:26,980
Oh, there's the door.

4351
03:02:34,040 --> 03:02:35,780
Seems pretty safe.

4352
03:02:41,200 --> 03:02:43,220
Seems pretty safe.

4353
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:46,740
Is there anything in here that I can...

4354
03:02:50,220 --> 03:02:51,360
It's quiet.

4355
03:02:52,140 --> 03:02:52,980
Quiet!

4356
03:02:52,980 --> 03:02:53,000
Quiet!

4357
03:03:01,990 --> 03:03:06,330
Oh my god!

4358
03:03:09,250 --> 03:03:10,130
Run, Snake!

4359
03:03:10,210 --> 03:03:10,670
Run!

4360
03:03:11,510 --> 03:03:12,170
Oh my...

4361
03:03:12,170 --> 03:03:12,990
Snake,

4362
03:03:24,480 --> 03:03:24,900
dodge!

4363
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:25,720
Dodge, Snake!

4364
03:03:26,680 --> 03:03:27,400
No way.

4365
03:03:30,100 --> 03:03:31,260
Throw it, Snake!

4366
03:03:31,520 --> 03:03:32,120
Throw it!

4367
03:03:32,780 --> 03:03:33,580
Oh my god.

4368
03:03:33,720 --> 03:03:34,960
Wait, Snake, you're gonna fall!

4369
03:03:35,400 --> 03:03:36,560
That's not how that works.

4370
03:03:39,260 --> 03:03:40,520
He stopped the momentum.

4371
03:03:40,520 --> 03:03:42,700
He hit the invisible wall and stopped the momentum.

4372
03:03:46,440 --> 03:03:47,360
How did that happen?

4373
03:03:50,640 --> 03:03:51,440
Let's go, Snake.

4374
03:03:52,060 --> 03:03:53,360
Blew that up with a grenade.

4375
03:03:53,920 --> 03:03:54,680
Perfect plan.

4376
03:03:54,800 --> 03:03:56,420
Exactly what I would have thought of too.

4377
03:04:00,080 --> 03:04:01,540
Where did those missiles come from?

4378
03:04:03,160 --> 03:04:04,740
I'm gonna take care of some errands.

4379
03:04:04,740 --> 03:04:07,420
But I'm now ready for a minute to take on Kojimbo's Wild Ride Part 2!

4380
03:04:08,360 --> 03:04:09,780
Time to run from a helicopter!

4381
03:04:10,520 --> 03:04:12,260
Oh my gosh!

4382
03:04:12,700 --> 03:04:13,720
A hindie!

4383
03:04:15,240 --> 03:04:17,540
What's a Russian gunship doing in an area like this?

4384
03:04:19,400 --> 03:04:20,040
Snake!

4385
03:04:21,120 --> 03:04:21,760
Liquid!

4386
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:24,840
I'm afraid I can't let you get past here!

4387
03:04:25,440 --> 03:04:26,080
Liquid!

4388
03:04:26,400 --> 03:04:26,720
Liquid!

4389
03:04:27,180 --> 03:04:29,080
You're not going any farther!

4390
03:04:29,500 --> 03:04:30,060
Die!

4391
03:04:32,340 --> 03:04:32,980
Hahaha!

4392
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:36,300
It's a long way down.

4393
03:04:36,840 --> 03:04:38,160
If only I had a rope.

4394
03:04:39,180 --> 03:04:39,620
Woah!

4395
03:04:40,760 --> 03:04:42,860
I should be able to use that rope I got.

4396
03:04:43,140 --> 03:04:44,480
What are you going to do?

4397
03:04:44,940 --> 03:04:47,460
Take on a hide with your bare hands?

4398
03:04:47,960 --> 03:04:48,400
Take on a hide with your bare hands?

4399
03:04:48,400 --> 03:04:49,360
Uh, yeah, you know it.

4400
03:04:51,480 --> 03:04:51,920
Woah!

4401
03:04:53,600 --> 03:04:54,040
Wait.

4402
03:04:56,500 --> 03:04:57,560
Did I get a rope?

4403
03:04:57,780 --> 03:04:59,720
If I stay here, I'm finished.

4404
03:05:00,060 --> 03:05:02,120
Did I get one while I was running away from the guards?

4405
03:05:02,520 --> 03:05:02,960
Did I get one while I was running away from the guards?

4406
03:05:06,500 --> 03:05:06,940
Uh...

4407
03:05:08,080 --> 03:05:09,500
This isn't where I fight him.

4408
03:05:09,600 --> 03:05:09,940
I go...

4409
03:05:09,940 --> 03:05:12,300
I go down first, right?

4410
03:05:15,580 --> 03:05:16,580
Oh, I did get a rope!

4411
03:05:20,060 --> 03:05:21,140
I did get a rope.

4412
03:05:21,200 --> 03:05:22,100
I didn't even notice it.

4413
03:05:23,840 --> 03:05:24,460
Here we go.

4414
03:05:30,410 --> 03:05:30,850
Whee!

4415
03:05:31,770 --> 03:05:32,210
Woah!

4416
03:05:35,270 --> 03:05:35,990
That's close.

4417
03:05:38,590 --> 03:05:39,230
Okay.

4418
03:05:39,530 --> 03:05:39,870
Okay.

4419
03:05:41,170 --> 03:05:42,510
Time to do this.

4420
03:05:42,770 --> 03:05:43,330
Whatever.

4421
03:05:43,570 --> 03:05:44,510
However this works.

4422
03:05:46,110 --> 03:05:46,750
Okay.

4423
03:05:47,970 --> 03:05:48,870
I'm moving.

4424
03:05:49,530 --> 03:05:50,610
I'm not moving.

4425
03:05:51,390 --> 03:05:53,610
Okay, it's still a cutscene.

4426
03:05:54,450 --> 03:05:55,430
Okay, I'm moving.

4427
03:05:56,030 --> 03:05:57,130
I'm going down.

4428
03:05:57,530 --> 03:05:58,430
Yes, please!

4429
03:06:00,630 --> 03:06:01,670
Thanks, Colonel!

4430
03:06:02,550 --> 03:06:02,870
Hahaha!

4431
03:06:02,930 --> 03:06:03,450
Hahaha!

4432
03:06:07,990 --> 03:06:08,510
Okay.

4433
03:06:08,830 --> 03:06:15,490
If you kick off the wall, while pushing the control stick left or right, you make a large jump in that direction.

4434
03:06:15,490 --> 03:06:16,870
He's so... he's so quiet.

4435
03:06:17,050 --> 03:06:21,230
You can walk slowly across the wall if you press and hold the B button.

4436
03:06:21,470 --> 03:06:22,190
Why would I...

4437
03:06:22,190 --> 03:06:28,130
To move a little at a time in a certain direction, push the control stick while holding the B button.

4438
03:06:28,570 --> 03:06:34,310
If you're careful with the timing, you should be able to dodge the gunfire from behind while you rappel down.

4439
03:06:34,490 --> 03:06:34,750
Okay.

4440
03:06:36,750 --> 03:06:37,410
You can, Snake.

4441
03:06:37,750 --> 03:06:38,150
Okay.

4442
03:06:40,650 --> 03:06:41,170
That's it.

4443
03:06:41,370 --> 03:06:41,690
All right.

4444
03:06:41,730 --> 03:06:42,270
Oh, here we go!

4445
03:06:43,310 --> 03:06:43,710
Ah!

4446
03:06:44,950 --> 03:06:45,350
Gosh.

4447
03:06:45,550 --> 03:06:45,950
Oh my gosh.

4448
03:06:46,810 --> 03:06:47,610
I'm just...

4449
03:06:47,610 --> 03:06:49,650
Oh, there's a... there's a ration.

4450
03:06:51,230 --> 03:06:51,830
Oh, nice!

4451
03:06:52,610 --> 03:06:53,250
Oh my god.

4452
03:06:53,610 --> 03:06:54,650
I somehow got it!

4453
03:06:56,690 --> 03:06:58,390
I don't know how I'm doing this.

4454
03:07:00,810 --> 03:07:01,670
I'm pushing off it.

4455
03:07:01,750 --> 03:07:02,170
Oh my gosh.

4456
03:07:02,450 --> 03:07:02,850
Oh!

4457
03:07:03,710 --> 03:07:04,110
Nice!

4458
03:07:05,350 --> 03:07:06,550
I think I'm cracked at this.

4459
03:07:06,750 --> 03:07:06,830
Oh!

4460
03:07:06,870 --> 03:07:07,630
Was that it?

4461
03:07:07,890 --> 03:07:08,950
Wait, I didn't...

4462
03:07:08,950 --> 03:07:11,790
That was

4463
03:07:20,260 --> 03:07:20,660
not me.

4464
03:07:20,800 --> 03:07:21,780
That was all Snake.

4465
03:07:22,320 --> 03:07:23,580
I didn't get hit once.

4466
03:07:24,760 --> 03:07:26,560
They were so kind with that part.

4467
03:07:26,780 --> 03:07:27,360
For real!

4468
03:07:29,720 --> 03:07:32,340
Twenty dollars for my 20th Super Chat.

4469
03:07:32,480 --> 03:07:32,960
No way.

4470
03:07:34,960 --> 03:07:35,760
Thank you!

4471
03:07:39,300 --> 03:07:40,100
What was that?

4472
03:07:41,100 --> 03:07:42,100
It was breathing.

4473
03:07:42,100 --> 03:07:42,360
Breathing?

4474
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:44,520
Oh...

4475
03:07:46,980 --> 03:07:47,760
Can I...

4476
03:07:47,760 --> 03:07:49,440
Oh, maybe I can C4 this now.

4477
03:07:53,950 --> 03:07:54,470
Uh...

4478
03:07:54,470 --> 03:07:55,510
How do I use it again?

4479
03:07:57,310 --> 03:07:58,370
A button to set.

4480
03:08:29,040 --> 03:08:29,560
Huh?

4481
03:08:30,700 --> 03:08:32,320
What's wrong with the alert though?

4482
03:08:36,690 --> 03:08:37,210
Huh?

4483
03:08:41,400 --> 03:08:41,920
Huh?

4484
03:08:46,380 --> 03:08:48,620
There are people over here though, aren't there?

4485
03:08:51,560 --> 03:08:52,300
Yeah, I see them.

4486
03:08:52,320 --> 03:08:52,620
I see them.

4487
03:08:53,900 --> 03:08:54,220
Um...

4488
03:08:55,540 --> 03:08:56,620
Let's take these guys out.

4489
03:08:59,960 --> 03:09:00,280
Crouch.

4490
03:09:01,100 --> 03:09:01,900
Take my meds.

4491
03:09:05,420 --> 03:09:05,740
Here.

4492
03:09:13,600 --> 03:09:14,980
I have to be really fast though.

4493
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:16,020
I have to be like boom, bam, boom.

4494
03:09:16,580 --> 03:09:17,080
Oh gosh.

4495
03:09:21,180 --> 03:09:22,060
Did I kill him?

4496
03:09:22,520 --> 03:09:23,020
Wait, wait.

4497
03:09:23,040 --> 03:09:23,860
I can't see them at all.

4498
03:09:23,860 --> 03:09:24,400
Oh my gosh.

4499
03:09:24,760 --> 03:09:25,880
I can't see them at all.

4500
03:09:26,900 --> 03:09:27,260
Wait.

4501
03:09:29,780 --> 03:09:31,380
They're not coming down, are they?

4502
03:09:31,800 --> 03:09:32,160
Ah!

4503
03:09:37,660 --> 03:09:38,440
Oh my gosh.

4504
03:09:38,900 --> 03:09:39,400
Scared me.

4505
03:09:41,480 --> 03:09:42,880
You guys could warn me.

4506
03:09:43,860 --> 03:09:44,060
Oh.

4507
03:09:54,920 --> 03:09:56,480
They won't be able to see me like this though.

4508
03:10:04,550 --> 03:10:04,910
Oh!

4509
03:10:04,990 --> 03:10:05,930
They can see me like this.

4510
03:10:06,130 --> 03:10:06,490
Ow!

4511
03:10:18,940 --> 03:10:20,400
Try the Nikita.

4512
03:10:20,820 --> 03:10:21,680
I don't wanna...

4513
03:10:21,680 --> 03:10:23,400
Wait, how many do I have?

4514
03:10:24,720 --> 03:10:25,200
40?

4515
03:10:28,240 --> 03:10:29,020
Hold on.

4516
03:10:29,040 --> 03:10:30,440
Let's see if the guys are still here.

4517
03:10:30,720 --> 03:10:33,640
If they respawned all three of them.

4518
03:10:33,680 --> 03:10:34,080
They did!

4519
03:10:36,120 --> 03:10:38,080
They did respawn all three of them.

4520
03:10:41,580 --> 03:10:43,240
It doesn't feel any easier.

4521
03:10:43,840 --> 03:10:44,460
You know?

4522
03:10:45,060 --> 03:10:46,020
Until I get them.

4523
03:10:47,640 --> 03:10:48,060
Hmm.

4524
03:10:49,940 --> 03:10:51,060
I could Nikita them.

4525
03:10:51,480 --> 03:10:54,120
If I Nikita one of them, will I get all three of them?

4526
03:10:55,140 --> 03:10:55,880
I wonder.

4527
03:10:57,060 --> 03:10:57,640
Wait, okay.

4528
03:10:57,720 --> 03:10:58,360
How do I use this thing?

4529
03:10:59,620 --> 03:11:00,040
Eh...

4530
03:11:00,480 --> 03:11:01,460
Release the fire.

4531
03:11:04,060 --> 03:11:04,480
Okay.

4532
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:10,300
Here we go!

4533
03:11:14,220 --> 03:11:15,640
They're not gonna shoot it down, are they?

4534
03:11:15,720 --> 03:11:16,100
Oh.

4535
03:11:18,380 --> 03:11:19,300
Don't shoot it down.

4536
03:11:19,580 --> 03:11:20,420
Don't shoot it down.

4537
03:11:29,950 --> 03:11:31,050
Are they all dead?

4538
03:11:31,570 --> 03:11:32,710
What do you mean no use?

4539
03:11:33,550 --> 03:11:35,650
This is the perfect time to use a scope.

4540
03:11:36,350 --> 03:11:37,550
What do you mean no use?

4541
03:11:39,530 --> 03:11:41,830
No, the other two guys are still up there, you guys.

4542
03:11:43,330 --> 03:11:44,790
I think it only took out one guy.

4543
03:11:46,250 --> 03:11:46,930
No way.

4544
03:11:50,130 --> 03:11:50,530
What?

4545
03:11:51,610 --> 03:11:52,910
They're all still standing.

4546
03:11:55,430 --> 03:11:56,790
I'm still standing.

4547
03:11:57,250 --> 03:11:59,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4548
03:12:01,210 --> 03:12:01,970
What?

4549
03:12:05,330 --> 03:12:05,710
What?

4550
03:12:07,330 --> 03:12:08,670
That's insane.

4551
03:12:09,670 --> 03:12:11,190
That's insane.

4552
03:12:14,130 --> 03:12:15,430
Oh, dang it.

4553
03:12:15,490 --> 03:12:16,290
Where did they go?

4554
03:12:16,530 --> 03:12:17,570
Where did they run to?

4555
03:12:18,790 --> 03:12:19,590
Oh.

4556
03:12:19,710 --> 03:12:20,250
Uh.

4557
03:12:25,770 --> 03:12:26,410
There we go.

4558
03:12:27,790 --> 03:12:29,670
I think I got all three of them now.

4559
03:12:30,150 --> 03:12:30,610
Uh.

4560
03:12:35,470 --> 03:12:36,270
Easy.

4561
03:12:45,230 --> 03:12:46,030
Pshh.

4562
03:12:46,710 --> 03:12:47,110
Pshh.

4563
03:12:50,270 --> 03:12:51,070
Pshh.

4564
03:12:51,070 --> 03:12:51,370
Ah!

4565
03:12:54,850 --> 03:12:55,290
Oh.

4566
03:12:58,010 --> 03:12:59,130
Stinger missile!

4567
03:13:03,240 --> 03:13:03,840
Die!

4568
03:13:08,540 --> 03:13:10,180
That guy's so dumb.

4569
03:13:10,440 --> 03:13:10,800
Why?

4570
03:13:10,980 --> 03:13:12,560
You can't get me if you're in a helicopter.

4571
03:13:12,900 --> 03:13:13,780
And I can go inside.

4572
03:13:14,100 --> 03:13:14,680
Dummy.

4573
03:13:16,440 --> 03:13:17,040
Idiot.

4574
03:13:18,480 --> 03:13:19,800
What a dummy.

4575
03:13:22,360 --> 03:13:23,880
What an idiot.

4576
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:26,680
You can't go inside the building in your helicopter.

4577
03:13:28,780 --> 03:13:30,560
What a silly goose.

4578
03:13:30,560 --> 03:13:31,040
Ah.

4579
03:13:32,380 --> 03:13:32,900
Ah.

4580
03:13:33,680 --> 03:13:34,200
Ah.

4581
03:13:35,620 --> 03:13:36,140
Uh.

4582
03:13:37,980 --> 03:13:38,960
What am I thinking?

4583
03:13:39,180 --> 03:13:40,420
I gotta go down the elevator.

4584
03:13:43,580 --> 03:13:44,560
Good one, boss.

4585
03:13:45,080 --> 03:13:45,600
Thanks.

4586
03:13:47,960 --> 03:13:48,480
Gosh.

4587
03:13:48,700 --> 03:13:49,920
He just doesn't have a brain.

4588
03:13:50,340 --> 03:13:52,360
He is the lesser...

4589
03:13:53,140 --> 03:13:54,820
He is the lesser...

4590
03:13:55,640 --> 03:13:56,160
clone.

4591
03:13:56,160 --> 03:14:00,700
The way to the top is blocked, huh?

4592
03:14:01,380 --> 03:14:01,780
The way to the top is blocked, huh?

4593
03:14:01,780 --> 03:14:03,180
Well, we can worry about that later.

4594
03:14:03,760 --> 03:14:05,900
Why don't you go and see what's happening below?

4595
03:14:07,100 --> 03:14:07,740
Why don't you go and see what's happening below?

4596
03:14:07,740 --> 03:14:08,220
Why don't I need to go?

4597
03:14:08,240 --> 03:14:09,220
Why do I need to go to the top?

4598
03:14:09,760 --> 03:14:11,220
Master Miller, what do you have to say?

4599
03:14:11,740 --> 03:14:12,740
No response, huh?

4600
03:14:13,620 --> 03:14:14,560
What are you busy doing?

4601
03:14:17,640 --> 03:14:19,220
Snake, I'm heading your way.

4602
03:14:19,400 --> 03:14:19,520
Snake, I'm heading your way.

4603
03:14:19,520 --> 03:14:20,560
What are you talking about?

4604
03:14:21,060 --> 03:14:22,640
There's something I've got to ask you.

4605
03:14:22,780 --> 03:14:23,700
What is it?

4606
03:14:26,160 --> 03:14:28,380
You see, I'll ask you when I see you.

4607
03:14:28,440 --> 03:14:28,860
Bye.

4608
03:14:29,120 --> 03:14:29,260
Wait a minute.

4609
03:14:29,260 --> 03:14:29,940
The death flags.

4610
03:14:32,360 --> 03:14:33,320
He's gonna confess.

4611
03:14:34,340 --> 03:14:35,500
He's gonna confess!

4612
03:14:37,100 --> 03:14:38,140
Hee hee hee hee.

4613
03:14:38,820 --> 03:14:40,140
Hee hee hee hee.

4614
03:14:40,160 --> 03:14:41,580
You have stinger missiles.

4615
03:14:41,900 --> 03:14:44,620
Now you have at least got a chance against the Hind.

4616
03:14:44,960 --> 03:14:46,020
Only a chance?

4617
03:14:46,300 --> 03:14:49,280
Well, you are not exactly evenly armed.

4618
03:14:49,560 --> 03:14:51,180
That Hind is a monster.

4619
03:14:51,480 --> 03:14:54,160
You only have a small chance to win.

4620
03:14:54,440 --> 03:14:56,500
But at least it's better than no chance.

4621
03:14:57,640 --> 03:14:59,420
Analysts are a cold-hearted bunch, huh?

4622
03:14:59,720 --> 03:15:04,020
To shoot around that Hind, you will have to get to a place with good visibility.

4623
03:15:04,600 --> 03:15:06,880
Do not try to fight in that walkway.

4624
03:15:06,980 --> 03:15:07,740
No, no, don't worry.

4625
03:15:07,740 --> 03:15:10,660
Get up on that roof, where you will have a clean shot at him.

4626
03:15:10,740 --> 03:15:11,820
Yeah, Master Miller's in the bathroom.

4627
03:15:12,480 --> 03:15:13,020
It's okay.

4628
03:15:13,360 --> 03:15:14,380
He's human, you know?

4629
03:15:15,960 --> 03:15:17,580
Yeah, it's a good point.

4630
03:15:17,720 --> 03:15:22,020
I didn't even realize or think about that I didn't have the stinger missiles.

4631
03:15:22,140 --> 03:15:26,260
So I was like, Let's go fight Hind with my Nikita missiles.

4632
03:15:26,580 --> 03:15:27,260
What is it, Snake?

4633
03:15:28,500 --> 03:15:30,480
We're just fighting with the Nikita missiles.

4634
03:15:30,680 --> 03:15:31,520
No big deal.

4635
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:35,040
If I go out there, is he still there?

4636
03:15:36,740 --> 03:15:38,600
Because I kind of want the ration.

4637
03:15:39,220 --> 03:15:46,300
The proud man does not eat rotting meat, even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts.

4638
03:15:46,340 --> 03:15:50,200
But on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got.

4639
03:15:50,280 --> 03:15:50,500
Yeah.

4640
03:15:52,640 --> 03:15:53,000
You shouldn't say that.

4641
03:15:53,100 --> 03:15:53,600
You shouldn't.

4642
03:15:53,620 --> 03:15:55,040
It's kind of insensitive.

4643
03:15:55,380 --> 03:15:58,100
Thank you for realizing that.

4644
03:15:59,140 --> 03:15:59,440
What the?

4645
03:16:02,640 --> 03:16:03,360
Huh?

4646
03:16:04,600 --> 03:16:05,620
That's so weird.

4647
03:16:08,280 --> 03:16:09,000
What?

4648
03:16:09,220 --> 03:16:11,020
Why wouldn't the elevator be working?

4649
03:16:12,360 --> 03:16:13,080
Hmm...

4650
03:16:14,800 --> 03:16:15,520
Hmm...

4651
03:16:16,440 --> 03:16:17,160
Fushigi...

4652
03:16:18,440 --> 03:16:18,800
Hmm...

4653
03:16:21,820 --> 03:16:22,540
Fushigi...

4654
03:16:24,020 --> 03:16:24,460
Donee...

4655
03:16:26,760 --> 03:16:28,160
It's kind of sus, not gonna lie.

4656
03:16:28,660 --> 03:16:30,000
It is a little sus, right?

4657
03:16:30,400 --> 03:16:30,840
Like...

4658
03:16:33,940 --> 03:16:40,340
Oh yeah, I should probably be making sure that there's no cameras down each way.

4659
03:16:41,520 --> 03:16:41,960
Okay.

4660
03:16:43,020 --> 03:16:43,460
Oh!

4661
03:16:44,200 --> 03:16:44,640
Damn!

4662
03:16:47,240 --> 03:16:47,680
Uh...

4663
03:16:48,560 --> 03:16:49,680
I didn't notice that.

4664
03:16:49,680 --> 03:16:51,440
I looked...

4665
03:16:51,440 --> 03:16:53,240
I looked at it...

4666
03:16:57,300 --> 03:16:59,220
Liquid is a silly goose!

4667
03:16:59,660 --> 03:17:01,640
Since Snake is no maverick!

4668
03:17:01,880 --> 03:17:07,200
Meanwhile, Otacon is slowly becoming a good wingman by melting Snake's Iceman cold heart!

4669
03:17:07,560 --> 03:17:08,360
Oh my...

4670
03:17:08,360 --> 03:17:09,060
Ah!

4671
03:17:13,340 --> 03:17:14,620
I would've had a...

4672
03:17:14,620 --> 03:17:15,440
moment.

4673
03:17:16,100 --> 03:17:17,880
I forgot that there's grip in this game.

4674
03:17:19,440 --> 03:17:20,300
Good job, Snake.

4675
03:17:22,480 --> 03:17:24,140
Good job, Snake.

4676
03:17:24,240 --> 03:17:25,980
Stop, you're gonna make me wanna watch...

4677
03:17:25,980 --> 03:17:27,060
Top Gun again.

4678
03:17:30,860 --> 03:17:31,900
Wait, is Otacon here?

4679
03:17:34,180 --> 03:17:34,660
Already?

4680
03:17:39,870 --> 03:17:41,410
Our little stealth guy.

4681
03:17:42,170 --> 03:17:42,190
Our little stealth guy.

4682
03:17:43,930 --> 03:17:44,630
Don't shoot!

4683
03:17:46,610 --> 03:17:48,150
Snake, you can put the gun down!

4684
03:17:48,390 --> 03:17:49,850
It's me, don't shoot!

4685
03:17:49,850 --> 03:17:51,590
You don't recognize his voice?

4686
03:17:51,970 --> 03:17:53,070
It's me, Snake.

4687
03:17:54,410 --> 03:17:55,930
Otacon, how'd you get here?

4688
03:17:57,130 --> 03:18:00,050
Well, it wasn't as dramatic as your entrance, believe me.

4689
03:18:00,910 --> 03:18:02,190
I'm afraid of heights.

4690
03:18:03,110 --> 03:18:04,270
You were watching?

4691
03:18:04,890 --> 03:18:06,230
Yeah, I was watching.

4692
03:18:06,270 --> 03:18:07,430
He's watching the whole time.

4693
03:18:07,470 --> 03:18:08,610
I was riding in the back of their truck.

4694
03:18:09,030 --> 03:18:10,830
Thanks to the stealth camouflage.

4695
03:18:11,210 --> 03:18:11,690
Whose truck?

4696
03:18:13,810 --> 03:18:15,170
How did you get up here?

4697
03:18:15,730 --> 03:18:17,530
The elevator, of course.

4698
03:18:18,510 --> 03:18:19,030
Okay.

4699
03:18:19,850 --> 03:18:21,390
Okay, so you're telling me that these guys...

4700
03:18:21,390 --> 03:18:23,710
The first floor of the circular staircase was destroyed.

4701
03:18:23,810 --> 03:18:25,450
...are just chilling in the elevator this whole time?

4702
03:18:25,450 --> 03:18:26,630
That's why I took the elevator.

4703
03:18:28,610 --> 03:18:30,330
The elevator was working.

4704
03:18:31,510 --> 03:18:32,770
Yeah, that's right.

4705
03:18:34,250 --> 03:18:35,530
Yeah, that's right.

4706
03:18:36,570 --> 03:18:37,090
Yeah.

4707
03:18:39,370 --> 03:18:39,890
Yup.

4708
03:18:42,990 --> 03:18:44,490
Just chilling the whole...

4709
03:18:46,710 --> 03:18:47,750
You're incredible.

4710
03:18:48,990 --> 03:18:49,830
You're incredible.

4711
03:18:49,850 --> 03:18:51,130
Like a movie hero or something.

4712
03:18:51,930 --> 03:18:53,390
Like a Japanese anime.

4713
03:18:53,850 --> 03:18:54,290
You're wrong.

4714
03:18:54,890 --> 03:18:58,130
In the movies, the hero always saves the girl.

4715
03:18:58,710 --> 03:19:00,030
You mean Meryl?

4716
03:19:01,090 --> 03:19:01,650
Sorry.

4717
03:19:02,090 --> 03:19:03,390
Forget I said anything.

4718
03:19:05,530 --> 03:19:06,590
It hurts.

4719
03:19:06,730 --> 03:19:07,890
It actually hurts more.

4720
03:19:08,110 --> 03:19:10,270
I feel like such a baby that I submitted.

4721
03:19:10,630 --> 03:19:12,790
There's something I've really gotta ask you.

4722
03:19:15,150 --> 03:19:17,150
It's why I followed you up this far.

4723
03:19:18,170 --> 03:19:18,830
What's that?

4724
03:19:19,850 --> 03:19:20,070
Have you ever...

4725
03:19:21,130 --> 03:19:22,210
loved someone?

4726
03:19:23,790 --> 03:19:25,370
Why is the music so creepy?

4727
03:19:25,370 --> 03:19:26,370
That's what you came to ask.

4728
03:19:26,750 --> 03:19:28,230
No, I mean...

4729
03:19:28,230 --> 03:19:32,710
I was wondering if even soldiers fall in love.

4730
03:19:33,430 --> 03:19:35,110
What are you trying to say?

4731
03:19:35,410 --> 03:19:35,810
What?

4732
03:19:36,010 --> 03:19:40,550
Do you think love can bloom even on a battlefield?

4733
03:19:40,950 --> 03:19:41,350
Yeah!

4734
03:19:43,830 --> 03:19:45,670
Yeah, I do.

4735
03:19:46,410 --> 03:19:48,030
The ending is worth it though.

4736
03:19:48,090 --> 03:19:48,850
You're so right.

4737
03:19:49,850 --> 03:19:51,610
People can fall in love with each other.

4738
03:19:52,670 --> 03:19:56,930
But if you love someone, you have to be able to protect them.

4739
03:19:59,530 --> 03:20:01,010
I think so too.

4740
03:20:04,310 --> 03:20:05,910
I have a favor to ask.

4741
03:20:06,690 --> 03:20:07,230
Uh oh.

4742
03:20:08,050 --> 03:20:09,750
Don't worry, it'll be easy.

4743
03:20:09,930 --> 03:20:10,990
He said the thing!

4744
03:20:11,190 --> 03:20:14,270
I told you before, I won't hurt anyone.

4745
03:20:17,610 --> 03:20:18,890
I don't want you to.

4746
03:20:19,090 --> 03:20:19,730
I'm sorry, I'm hungry.

4747
03:20:19,850 --> 03:20:20,010
Oh!

4748
03:20:20,730 --> 03:20:22,790
Look at that playful shove.

4749
03:20:23,170 --> 03:20:24,770
The elevator has stopped down there.

4750
03:20:24,910 --> 03:20:26,450
I want you to get it to move.

4751
03:20:26,870 --> 03:20:27,970
Wait, what do you mean down there?

4752
03:20:28,790 --> 03:20:29,310
Oh.

4753
03:20:29,530 --> 03:20:29,870
You see?

4754
03:20:30,350 --> 03:20:30,770
You see?

4755
03:20:36,120 --> 03:20:37,060
That's weird.

4756
03:20:37,520 --> 03:20:38,580
That is weird.

4757
03:20:38,960 --> 03:20:41,080
It was working before, but now it isn't.

4758
03:20:42,060 --> 03:20:43,520
Maybe the panel's broken.

4759
03:20:44,720 --> 03:20:45,900
Can you fix it?

4760
03:20:46,340 --> 03:20:47,620
Can you fix it?

4761
03:20:47,660 --> 03:20:48,540
It was working before.

4762
03:20:48,540 --> 03:20:51,680
If it's the mechanism, leave it to me.

4763
03:20:53,440 --> 03:20:53,960
Mateus!

4764
03:20:53,960 --> 03:20:56,020
I've gotta go and swat a noisy fly.

4765
03:20:56,660 --> 03:20:57,180
Okay.

4766
03:20:58,100 --> 03:20:59,900
I'll stay here and hold the fort.

4767
03:21:00,340 --> 03:21:01,120
Good luck.

4768
03:21:01,300 --> 03:21:02,460
You'll definitely do that.

4769
03:21:04,180 --> 03:21:05,740
You really look like hell.

4770
03:21:05,960 --> 03:21:06,700
Are you okay?

4771
03:21:14,160 --> 03:21:14,860
Don't worry.

4772
03:21:15,600 --> 03:21:17,860
If I do this, it doesn't matter.

4773
03:21:18,600 --> 03:21:19,620
Saku, thank you.

4774
03:21:20,600 --> 03:21:21,120
Aww.

4775
03:21:22,020 --> 03:21:23,220
Let's pretend like I'm not here.

4776
03:21:23,980 --> 03:21:25,380
Then I'm not scared.

4777
03:21:26,640 --> 03:21:28,020
Looks like he's got a mustache.

4778
03:21:29,440 --> 03:21:30,540
Strange logic.

4779
03:21:32,000 --> 03:21:33,360
I'm counting on you.

4780
03:21:36,280 --> 03:21:36,880
I'm counting on you.

4781
03:21:36,880 --> 03:21:37,200
I'm counting on you.

4782
03:21:37,200 --> 03:21:38,520
That will become a handshake later.

4783
03:21:38,880 --> 03:21:39,140
That will become a handshake later.

4784
03:21:40,420 --> 03:21:41,360
Here it goes.

4785
03:21:41,680 --> 03:21:42,980
Mysterious Sasquatch.

4786
03:21:45,480 --> 03:21:46,080
Monocon.

4787
03:21:46,560 --> 03:21:50,400
I love Snake's mocap in this.

4788
03:21:50,640 --> 03:21:51,360
Oh, nice!

4789
03:21:52,460 --> 03:21:53,460
I mean, not nice.

4790
03:21:53,520 --> 03:21:55,100
We're about to go fight a hindie.

4791
03:21:58,000 --> 03:21:58,560
It's strange.

4792
03:21:58,560 --> 03:22:00,700
It looks like Liquid really wants to have a showdown with you.

4793
03:22:01,140 --> 03:22:04,520
I'm looking at Madeleine's digitally enhanced satellite images right now.

4794
03:22:04,560 --> 03:22:05,400
He really wants to fight.

4795
03:22:05,580 --> 03:22:07,400
It seems he's waiting for you.

4796
03:22:07,820 --> 03:22:09,620
Like a vulture circling its prey.

4797
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:10,440
Ew.

4798
03:22:12,480 --> 03:22:13,360
Are you?

4799
03:22:13,700 --> 03:22:15,900
I wish I could do something to help.

4800
03:22:16,280 --> 03:22:18,180
Are you guys enjoying the live broadcast?

4801
03:22:18,500 --> 03:22:19,160
Please don't go up on the roof.

4802
03:22:19,160 --> 03:22:20,060
I have to.

4803
03:22:20,620 --> 03:22:22,340
I can't run from this one.

4804
03:22:26,900 --> 03:22:30,580
Sometimes there's like a long pause between the codex.

4805
03:22:31,360 --> 03:22:32,620
Like when they're finishing them.

4806
03:22:33,500 --> 03:22:34,240
Master Miller.

4807
03:22:34,520 --> 03:22:35,200
What about you?

4808
03:22:35,240 --> 03:22:37,300
I'm about to go fight a helicopter, Master Miller.

4809
03:22:37,460 --> 03:22:38,660
I really need your advice.

4810
03:22:39,280 --> 03:22:40,060
I'm scared.

4811
03:22:40,560 --> 03:22:43,180
Actually, maybe Nastasha would be the most helpful here.

4812
03:22:43,620 --> 03:22:45,240
You have stinger missiles.

4813
03:22:45,240 --> 03:22:48,240
Now you have at least got a chance against the hind.

4814
03:22:48,260 --> 03:22:48,480
Oh, wait.

4815
03:22:49,060 --> 03:22:49,940
Oh, okay.

4816
03:22:50,020 --> 03:22:50,880
She said the same thing.

4817
03:22:51,520 --> 03:22:55,340
I think after I beat the hind, we'll get something to eat.

4818
03:22:56,820 --> 03:22:58,520
You're gonna go after that hind now?

4819
03:22:58,820 --> 03:22:59,180
Yep.

4820
03:22:59,600 --> 03:23:00,980
After you're behind.

4821
03:23:01,680 --> 03:23:03,220
It's just circling the tower.

4822
03:23:03,440 --> 03:23:04,900
He must be waiting for you.

4823
03:23:05,140 --> 03:23:07,400
Well, you won't hear it for much longer.

4824
03:23:07,680 --> 03:23:08,160
Good.

4825
03:23:08,440 --> 03:23:11,760
In the meantime, I'll fix the elevator so you can use it later.

4826
03:23:13,160 --> 03:23:13,640
Hindy.

4827
03:23:15,780 --> 03:23:16,800
What about Deep Throat?

4828
03:23:16,940 --> 03:23:18,160
I know he's not gonna say anything.

4829
03:23:18,360 --> 03:23:19,000
That guy's shy.

4830
03:23:20,540 --> 03:23:21,500
No, no, no, no.

4831
03:23:22,240 --> 03:23:23,720
Liquid is still hovering.

4832
03:23:24,580 --> 03:23:25,140
Yeah, yeah.

4833
03:23:25,240 --> 03:23:25,660
Hold on.

4834
03:23:26,180 --> 03:23:26,580
Meiling.

4835
03:23:26,640 --> 03:23:26,940
There we go.

4836
03:23:28,380 --> 03:23:29,120
What's up, Snake?

4837
03:23:29,420 --> 03:23:33,400
You can buy fire department elevator override keys on eBay?

4838
03:23:34,700 --> 03:23:35,100
What?

4839
03:23:36,460 --> 03:23:37,620
What does that do?

4840
03:23:38,240 --> 03:23:39,060
What does that do?

4841
03:23:39,280 --> 03:23:43,060
Does it just make you able to use the elevator however you want?

4842
03:23:45,020 --> 03:23:51,160
In China, they say, once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow.

4843
03:23:51,440 --> 03:23:53,180
That's a perfect description of you.

4844
03:23:53,280 --> 03:23:55,920
You can do it, Snake, but you've got to be flexible.

4845
03:23:56,120 --> 03:23:58,340
Adapt to each situation uniquely.

4846
03:23:59,820 --> 03:24:00,300
Okay.

4847
03:24:01,280 --> 03:24:01,980
All right.

4848
03:24:02,980 --> 03:24:04,540
I'm getting very hungry.

4849
03:24:04,700 --> 03:24:06,100
So, let's see.

4850
03:24:06,220 --> 03:24:07,100
Stinger missiles.

4851
03:24:08,040 --> 03:24:09,220
Aim in first person.

4852
03:24:09,520 --> 03:24:10,480
Fire with A.

4853
03:24:10,940 --> 03:24:11,420
Align.

4854
03:24:11,720 --> 03:24:12,520
Sight on target.

4855
03:24:14,840 --> 03:24:15,640
Wait, what was that?

4856
03:24:16,820 --> 03:24:17,660
Fire with A.

4857
03:24:19,120 --> 03:24:19,640
Okay.

4858
03:24:21,400 --> 03:24:22,140
Let's go.

4859
03:24:23,600 --> 03:24:25,740
Can you see Otacon down here?

4860
03:24:29,270 --> 03:24:32,850
Is he, like, chilling around in here?

4861
03:24:34,510 --> 03:24:36,350
I mean, there's nowhere for him to go.

4862
03:24:37,350 --> 03:24:37,870
Right?

4863
03:24:37,870 --> 03:24:38,390
Like...

4864
03:24:42,890 --> 03:24:44,370
He's using stealth camel.

4865
03:24:45,610 --> 03:24:47,650
But, I mean, it's not, like, the best.

4866
03:24:49,110 --> 03:24:49,770
Thermal goggles?

4867
03:24:50,810 --> 03:24:51,930
I don't have thermal.

4868
03:24:51,930 --> 03:24:52,870
I only have night vision.

4869
03:24:53,610 --> 03:24:54,710
Oh, my eyes.

4870
03:24:55,730 --> 03:24:57,290
Okay, never mind.

4871
03:24:57,830 --> 03:24:58,470
Okay, let's go.

4872
03:25:00,930 --> 03:25:01,590
Let's go!

4873
03:25:01,750 --> 03:25:04,810
Oh, I should have used the body armor for the stairs.

4874
03:25:05,490 --> 03:25:06,230
It's okay, though.

4875
03:25:08,570 --> 03:25:08,970
Ikimashou.

4876
03:25:13,640 --> 03:25:15,460
Yeah, I don't even have the thermal goggles.

4877
03:25:17,940 --> 03:25:18,160
What the...

4878
03:25:18,160 --> 03:25:22,560
Oh, my gosh.

4879
03:25:24,700 --> 03:25:25,820
You jerky!

4880
03:25:37,380 --> 03:25:37,940
Gosh...

4881
03:25:37,940 --> 03:25:40,960
Okay, this is where I have to start looking out for the...

4882
03:25:42,800 --> 03:25:43,880
For the...

4883
03:25:44,680 --> 03:25:45,240
Cameras.

4884
03:25:48,400 --> 03:25:50,100
I didn't know MGS was moved to today.

4885
03:25:50,280 --> 03:25:51,240
I'm sorry!

4886
03:25:51,700 --> 03:25:52,260
Yeah...

4887
03:25:52,820 --> 03:25:53,380
Like...

4888
03:25:53,960 --> 03:25:55,520
Some of my plans...

4889
03:25:56,800 --> 03:25:58,680
Got moved around last minute.

4890
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:01,100
I'm so sorry.

4891
03:26:01,200 --> 03:26:03,160
I tried to announce it in several places.

4892
03:26:03,840 --> 03:26:05,380
I put the waiting room up earlier.

4893
03:26:06,060 --> 03:26:06,800
It's okay, though.

4894
03:26:09,560 --> 03:26:12,960
Honestly, a lot of it was me trying to get the dang PSG so far.

4895
03:26:13,620 --> 03:26:14,200
So far.

4896
03:26:17,300 --> 03:26:17,860
There we go.

4897
03:26:18,020 --> 03:26:22,100
A little too high.

4898
03:26:23,680 --> 03:26:24,040
Hello?

4899
03:26:25,300 --> 03:26:26,640
I feel like that should have hit it.

4900
03:26:26,820 --> 03:26:27,320
There we go.

4901
03:26:27,400 --> 03:26:27,600
Okay.

4902
03:26:29,600 --> 03:26:32,560
My last Oshi blasted off into space on a rocket ship.

4903
03:26:32,720 --> 03:26:32,880
Whoa!

4904
03:26:33,060 --> 03:26:33,900
That sounds awesome!

4905
03:26:34,360 --> 03:26:35,860
She also used to stream MGS.

4906
03:26:35,940 --> 03:26:36,740
Thanks for the stream.

4907
03:26:37,100 --> 03:26:37,840
Of course!

4908
03:26:39,580 --> 03:26:41,900
You know, I could be your new Oshi if you wanted.

4909
03:26:42,140 --> 03:26:43,000
Just saying.

4910
03:26:43,100 --> 03:26:44,800
No pressure or anything.

4911
03:26:45,160 --> 03:26:47,120
I also play MGS.

4912
03:26:48,200 --> 03:26:48,700
And...

4913
03:26:49,780 --> 03:26:51,360
I have no reason to go to space.

4914
03:26:51,820 --> 03:26:52,320
So...

4915
03:26:54,860 --> 03:26:55,800
I'm just saying.

4916
03:26:55,800 --> 03:26:55,880
I am.

4917
03:27:03,300 --> 03:27:04,260
Sneaky snarky.

4918
03:27:13,510 --> 03:27:15,110
I can't ever get this one.

4919
03:27:15,390 --> 03:27:15,870
Properly.

4920
03:27:16,690 --> 03:27:17,670
Here we go.

4921
03:27:20,230 --> 03:27:21,570
You're my new Oshi.

4922
03:27:22,590 --> 03:27:23,070
Wow.

4923
03:27:23,150 --> 03:27:24,170
Where's your sense of loyalty?

4924
03:27:25,730 --> 03:27:26,610
No, I'm just kidding.

4925
03:27:27,630 --> 03:27:29,490
You threw away your old Oshi that fast?

4926
03:27:29,970 --> 03:27:31,370
Where is your sense of loyalty?

4927
03:27:31,990 --> 03:27:32,830
I'm just kidding.

4928
03:27:33,030 --> 03:27:33,530
Hahaha.

4929
03:27:35,430 --> 03:27:37,450
Amazing how much easier this part is.

4930
03:27:37,550 --> 03:27:38,070
I know, right?

4931
03:27:38,210 --> 03:27:40,670
Actually, it feels unfair a little bit.

4932
03:27:43,590 --> 03:27:44,550
Oh my gosh!

4933
03:27:44,750 --> 03:27:46,310
This part is so goofy.

4934
03:27:47,170 --> 03:27:48,270
So funny though.

4935
03:27:59,990 --> 03:28:00,690
Here we go.

4936
03:28:04,320 --> 03:28:04,800
Nice.

4937
03:28:06,440 --> 03:28:07,780
We had to move on.

4938
03:28:08,620 --> 03:28:09,600
Yeah, I get it.

4939
03:28:13,450 --> 03:28:14,550
I do get it.

4940
03:28:14,730 --> 03:28:15,670
But if I found...

4941
03:28:15,770 --> 03:28:17,850
someone very similar to my Oshi...

4942
03:28:17,850 --> 03:28:20,370
Even if it was like a similar voice and everything...

4943
03:28:20,370 --> 03:28:21,050
I'd be like...

4944
03:28:21,050 --> 03:28:22,290
I probably would also be like...

4945
03:28:22,290 --> 03:28:22,790
Okay, you know what?

4946
03:28:25,770 --> 03:28:26,850
I get it.

4947
03:28:27,010 --> 03:28:27,410
Hahaha.

4948
03:28:28,770 --> 03:28:29,330
Okay.

4949
03:28:30,570 --> 03:28:32,210
I'd probably also move on.

4950
03:28:35,090 --> 03:28:35,650
Nice.

4951
03:28:46,360 --> 03:28:47,480
Health is...

4952
03:28:48,200 --> 03:28:49,080
good enough.

4953
03:28:52,020 --> 03:28:53,880
I won't grab that ration.

4954
03:28:54,120 --> 03:28:55,980
Well, actually, I don't think I could come back here.

4955
03:28:56,300 --> 03:28:57,040
So you know what?

4956
03:28:57,060 --> 03:28:58,080
We will just top off.

4957
03:28:58,960 --> 03:28:59,400
Choose!

4958
03:29:00,580 --> 03:29:03,360
Loyalty to your former Oshi or your loyalty to Minto.

4959
03:29:03,740 --> 03:29:04,180
Choose!

4960
03:29:09,590 --> 03:29:10,670
Don't make me choose!

4961
03:29:11,630 --> 03:29:12,390
Where's the door?

4962
03:29:13,250 --> 03:29:13,690
Huh?

4963
03:29:15,650 --> 03:29:16,090
Oh!

4964
03:29:16,250 --> 03:29:16,690
Oh, here it is.

4965
03:29:18,610 --> 03:29:19,690
Here we go!

4966
03:29:20,130 --> 03:29:20,330
Here we go!

4967
03:29:20,330 --> 03:29:22,450
I noticed the ladder this time.

4968
03:29:22,590 --> 03:29:22,990
I noticed.

4969
03:29:36,360 --> 03:29:36,960
Oh.

4970
03:29:37,840 --> 03:29:38,440
Okay.

4971
03:29:39,100 --> 03:29:41,080
Have I told you lately that you're truly awful?

4972
03:29:41,660 --> 03:29:42,260
Really?

4973
03:29:44,300 --> 03:29:44,900
Me?

4974
03:29:45,120 --> 03:29:46,280
I'm the bad one?

4975
03:29:47,740 --> 03:29:48,340
Me?

4976
03:29:49,260 --> 03:29:50,060
Mm-hmm.

4977
03:29:52,440 --> 03:29:53,040
Sorry.

4978
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:53,240
Sorry.

4979
03:29:54,060 --> 03:29:55,540
Only unshowered people are my Oshi.

4980
03:29:55,700 --> 03:29:56,740
Goodbye forever, Minto.

4981
03:29:58,140 --> 03:30:00,220
How do you know I didn't shower today, huh?

4982
03:30:02,180 --> 03:30:03,740
When will we get to see a...

4983
03:30:03,740 --> 03:30:06,340
Made Mint live reaction to Ocelot kissing Snake?

4984
03:30:07,920 --> 03:30:08,640
Made Mint live reaction to Ocelot kissing Snake?

4985
03:30:08,640 --> 03:30:09,100
I don't know.

4986
03:30:09,140 --> 03:30:09,940
Oh, don't forget to save.

4987
03:30:10,020 --> 03:30:11,440
I don't know.

4988
03:30:11,500 --> 03:30:12,840
Maybe sooner than you think.

4989
03:30:12,920 --> 03:30:13,260
Who knows?

4990
03:30:14,940 --> 03:30:16,120
What can I do for you, Snake?

4991
03:30:19,560 --> 03:30:21,980
Yeah, I really don't want to have to go through shooting all those again.

4992
03:30:21,980 --> 03:30:22,540
Yeah, I really don't want to have to go through shooting all those again.

4993
03:30:23,040 --> 03:30:28,260
Though usually it's pretty good about, like, just sending me back, but, you know, what if something happens to the disc?

4994
03:30:28,380 --> 03:30:28,660
Who knows?

4995
03:30:29,200 --> 03:30:32,480
He who is firm in will molds the world to himself.

4996
03:30:33,360 --> 03:30:35,020
Don't forget what you're here to do.

4997
03:30:35,160 --> 03:30:37,980
You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.

4998
03:30:38,400 --> 03:30:41,360
But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?

4999
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:43,700
She's so flirty sounding, you know?

5000
03:30:45,680 --> 03:30:46,120
She's so flirty sounding, you know?

5001
03:30:46,120 --> 03:30:48,700
Liquid is still hovering around the roof of Tower B.

5002
03:30:49,040 --> 03:30:50,260
He's waiting for you.

5003
03:30:50,400 --> 03:30:51,240
He's waiting for me?

5004
03:30:53,040 --> 03:30:53,820
He's waiting for you to take him on.

5005
03:30:53,980 --> 03:30:54,500
Woohoo!

5006
03:30:59,470 --> 03:31:02,190
I'll repair the elevator while you're fighting that hind.

5007
03:31:02,430 --> 03:31:04,590
It might take some time, so don't hurry.

5008
03:31:04,830 --> 03:31:05,110
Okay.

5009
03:31:06,190 --> 03:31:07,550
I'll take my time.

5010
03:31:09,490 --> 03:31:10,130
Oh, wait.

5011
03:31:10,230 --> 03:31:12,030
I should switch to the body armor.

5012
03:31:13,550 --> 03:31:14,670
Seize the moment.

5013
03:31:18,870 --> 03:31:19,390
Brother!

5014
03:31:24,790 --> 03:31:27,970
So, the snake's finally come out of his hole.

5015
03:31:28,370 --> 03:31:31,190
Are you ready now, my brother?

5016
03:31:31,850 --> 03:31:33,410
Why are you calling me brother?

5017
03:31:33,610 --> 03:31:34,890
Who the hell are you?

5018
03:31:34,930 --> 03:31:35,770
He explained it.

5019
03:31:36,330 --> 03:31:37,210
I'm you.

5020
03:31:37,690 --> 03:31:39,210
I'm your shadow.

5021
03:31:40,870 --> 03:31:42,030
I'm the son...

5022
03:31:42,670 --> 03:31:44,750
Ask the father that you killed.

5023
03:31:45,590 --> 03:31:46,190
What?

5024
03:31:46,190 --> 03:31:48,270
I'll send you to Hell to meet him.

5025
03:31:49,590 --> 03:31:50,190
What?

5026
03:31:55,090 --> 03:31:56,990
A cat is so... What?

5027
03:31:57,990 --> 03:31:59,110
Standing man emoji.

5028
03:31:59,310 --> 03:31:59,670
What?

5029
03:32:00,790 --> 03:32:01,250
Okay.

5030
03:32:02,490 --> 03:32:03,250
All right.

5031
03:32:03,350 --> 03:32:04,590
Okay, so we can see him.

5032
03:32:05,390 --> 03:32:05,850
There.

5033
03:32:06,110 --> 03:32:08,330
Where's our stinger?

5034
03:32:15,200 --> 03:32:15,960
What is he?

5035
03:32:16,040 --> 03:32:17,600
Oh, he's fast.

5036
03:32:19,640 --> 03:32:20,100
Hey!

5037
03:32:20,540 --> 03:32:21,620
I don't know if that'll work.

5038
03:32:22,940 --> 03:32:23,960
Oh, I guess it did work.

5039
03:32:25,780 --> 03:32:26,520
Oh my gosh.

5040
03:32:26,540 --> 03:32:27,500
It's so fast.

5041
03:32:28,540 --> 03:32:29,800
How is it so fast?

5042
03:32:30,660 --> 03:32:31,060
Oh.

5043
03:32:43,540 --> 03:32:44,540
He's so fast.

5044
03:32:45,720 --> 03:32:46,960
Maybe he'll come around this way.

5045
03:32:48,180 --> 03:32:48,900
Oh, there he is.

5046
03:32:49,840 --> 03:32:50,240
Ouch.

5047
03:32:51,440 --> 03:32:52,420
Taking a lot of hits.

5048
03:32:53,680 --> 03:32:56,920
Oh my gosh.

5049
03:33:00,990 --> 03:33:02,370
Just posting a bullet is nice.

5050
03:33:05,050 --> 03:33:05,450
Oh.

5051
03:33:06,070 --> 03:33:06,810
Where is he?

5052
03:33:06,890 --> 03:33:07,650
Where'd he go?

5053
03:33:08,510 --> 03:33:12,910
I don't think I got him.

5054
03:33:14,510 --> 03:33:14,970
Ouch!

5055
03:33:20,610 --> 03:33:21,410
Oh my gosh.

5056
03:33:21,730 --> 03:33:23,850
He doesn't hit me as easily though.

5057
03:33:28,950 --> 03:33:30,410
Oh, ouch, ouch.

5058
03:33:48,330 --> 03:33:49,470
I don't know if that'll work.

5059
03:33:51,410 --> 03:33:54,230
Are you telling me I had a bad shot?

5060
03:33:54,810 --> 03:33:55,610
Over here.

5061
03:33:55,850 --> 03:33:56,490
Over here?

5062
03:33:56,810 --> 03:33:56,890
Kai!

5063
03:33:59,990 --> 03:34:00,390
Oh.

5064
03:34:00,510 --> 03:34:00,910
Aah!

5065
03:34:06,340 --> 03:34:07,300
Where am I supposed to go?

5066
03:34:08,560 --> 03:34:08,960
Oh.

5067
03:34:09,920 --> 03:34:10,380
That's it?

5068
03:34:10,600 --> 03:34:11,660
That's all you got?!

5069
03:34:11,660 --> 03:34:13,860
That's all you've got?

5070
03:34:14,340 --> 03:34:14,740
Liquid?

5071
03:34:21,720 --> 03:34:23,460
Oh, is he doing the down, low thing.

5072
03:34:29,640 --> 03:34:30,440
Doh Ouchy.

5073
03:34:30,440 --> 03:34:31,000
Ouchy ouchy ouchy ouchy.

5074
03:34:33,380 --> 03:34:33,780
Liquid?

5075
03:34:44,160 --> 03:34:53,740
You can't tell when he's down looks like Before, the music would get so quiet.

5076
03:34:59,900 --> 03:35:00,420
Yeah,

5077
03:35:07,060 --> 03:35:08,160
I hit you.

5078
03:35:08,300 --> 03:35:09,920
It was a nice shot, actually.

5079
03:35:10,640 --> 03:35:12,460
Gosh, this fight is so much easier.

5080
03:35:26,030 --> 03:35:27,610
Oh my god, you're so loud, please.

5081
03:35:36,360 --> 03:35:37,240
It does

5082
03:35:48,020 --> 03:35:49,320
get a little bit quieter.

5083
03:35:50,580 --> 03:35:51,540
Where the heck is he?

5084
03:35:51,880 --> 03:35:52,500
This side?

5085
03:35:53,080 --> 03:35:53,520
Yeah.

5086
03:36:00,840 --> 03:36:01,880
I lost you.

5087
03:36:02,000 --> 03:36:02,760
Where are you?

5088
03:36:08,440 --> 03:36:10,140
I keep losing you.

5089
03:36:10,300 --> 03:36:14,580
I keep losing you, Liquid.

5090
03:36:14,740 --> 03:36:15,700
You come here first.

5091
03:36:17,220 --> 03:36:18,460
You come here first.

5092
03:36:31,290 --> 03:36:33,250
Um, skill issue, perhaps?

5093
03:36:33,690 --> 03:36:34,410
Liquid?

5094
03:36:34,710 --> 03:36:35,430
Oh my god.

5095
03:36:47,760 --> 03:36:49,720
There's this piece of junk.

5096
03:36:51,840 --> 03:36:53,540
Where the heck are you?

5097
03:36:56,720 --> 03:36:57,820
Oh my gosh.

5098
03:37:00,730 --> 03:37:02,050
That's so loud.

5099
03:37:11,250 --> 03:37:12,610
Maybe he'll come over this.

5100
03:37:22,020 --> 03:37:23,780
How did I avoid that?

5101
03:37:29,260 --> 03:37:30,100
Hey, this!

5102
03:37:53,780 --> 03:37:54,640
Almost there.

5103
03:38:09,460 --> 03:38:11,160
They did this in the original... Oh, never mind.

5104
03:38:16,420 --> 03:38:17,380
Where did you...

5105
03:38:17,380 --> 03:38:18,220
What?

5106
03:38:18,380 --> 03:38:18,880
Oh.

5107
03:38:18,920 --> 03:38:19,220
Oh.

5108
03:38:19,380 --> 03:38:19,740
Oh.

5109
03:38:19,880 --> 03:38:20,100
Oh.

5110
03:38:20,100 --> 03:38:20,200
What?

5111
03:38:24,950 --> 03:38:25,630
Yippee!

5112
03:38:27,510 --> 03:38:28,730
There's the hellfire.

5113
03:38:30,530 --> 03:38:31,310
Eat this!

5114
03:38:31,430 --> 03:38:31,970
Oh, here it is.

5115
03:38:32,070 --> 03:38:33,070
The best part.

5116
03:38:33,450 --> 03:38:34,390
Go, Snake!

5117
03:38:34,470 --> 03:38:34,650
Go!

5118
03:38:44,340 --> 03:38:45,020
Yeah!

5119
03:38:46,700 --> 03:38:47,380
Yeah!

5120
03:38:49,760 --> 03:38:50,440
Yeah!

5121
03:39:03,020 --> 03:39:05,360
Good thing we got that body armor on.

5122
03:39:05,360 --> 03:39:06,160
Come on!

5123
03:39:06,400 --> 03:39:07,000
Fly!

5124
03:39:11,600 --> 03:39:12,400
Liquid!

5125
03:39:22,770 --> 03:39:25,110
See you in hell, Liquid.

5126
03:39:25,410 --> 03:39:26,010
Yeah!

5127
03:39:28,970 --> 03:39:30,270
Absolute cinema.

5128
03:39:31,350 --> 03:39:32,710
Explosions in the background.

5129
03:39:33,090 --> 03:39:33,850
Yeah!

5130
03:39:35,930 --> 03:39:36,730
Yeah!

5131
03:39:36,730 --> 03:39:38,330
That's my action here!

5132
03:39:38,550 --> 03:39:39,150
Yeah!

5133
03:39:47,960 --> 03:39:49,800
Snake, the elevator's working.

5134
03:39:50,020 --> 03:39:51,020
You fixed it?

5135
03:39:51,460 --> 03:39:53,180
No, that's the weird thing.

5136
03:39:53,360 --> 03:39:54,760
It just moved by itself.

5137
03:39:55,500 --> 03:39:56,900
It's headed your way now.

5138
03:39:57,140 --> 03:39:58,060
Is that so?

5139
03:39:58,300 --> 03:39:58,700
Freaky.

5140
03:39:58,700 --> 03:39:59,740
So not at all.

5141
03:40:00,120 --> 03:40:00,260
Okay.

5142
03:40:00,580 --> 03:40:02,900
That explosion before, what was it?

5143
03:40:03,060 --> 03:40:05,300
Oh, I had to take out that helicopter.

5144
03:40:06,820 --> 03:40:07,300
Helicopter?

5145
03:40:08,220 --> 03:40:09,700
That's incredible, Snake.

5146
03:40:09,760 --> 03:40:11,060
You knew I was going up there.

5147
03:40:11,300 --> 03:40:12,560
Listen, I just want to make sure again.

5148
03:40:12,940 --> 03:40:14,240
This is the way to get to where...

5149
03:40:14,240 --> 03:40:14,900
I do not hate this ever.

5150
03:40:14,900 --> 03:40:15,760
Metal Gear is being restored.

5151
03:40:15,900 --> 03:40:16,200
I know.

5152
03:40:16,200 --> 03:40:16,660
It's so awesome.

5153
03:40:16,960 --> 03:40:17,340
Yeah.

5154
03:40:17,340 --> 03:40:21,520
The entrance to the underground maintenance base is towards the back of the snowfield ahead.

5155
03:40:22,260 --> 03:40:22,660
Okay.

5156
03:40:23,120 --> 03:40:25,320
Find a safe place to hide out for a while.

5157
03:40:25,760 --> 03:40:26,660
I'm going underground.

5158
03:40:27,180 --> 03:40:27,900
I know.

5159
03:40:27,960 --> 03:40:28,440
I know.

5160
03:40:28,540 --> 03:40:29,380
You don't have to tell me.

5161
03:40:29,380 --> 03:40:29,780
I'm going offline.

5162
03:40:30,120 --> 03:40:31,440
And stay out of my way.

5163
03:40:31,940 --> 03:40:33,720
Don't try to be a hero or anything.

5164
03:40:34,300 --> 03:40:34,700
Okay.

5165
03:40:35,300 --> 03:40:36,480
Call me if you need to.

5166
03:40:36,620 --> 03:40:36,660
Okay.

5167
03:40:37,480 --> 03:40:38,180
All right.

5168
03:40:39,400 --> 03:40:40,040
Mm-hmm.

5169
03:40:40,640 --> 03:40:41,560
Let's brag to Miller.

5170
03:40:41,680 --> 03:40:41,980
Oh, my God.

5171
03:40:42,000 --> 03:40:43,260
Master Miller's going to be really proud.

5172
03:40:43,260 --> 03:40:44,700
He's going to be like, Sorry.

5173
03:40:45,320 --> 03:40:46,420
I was really...

5174
03:40:46,420 --> 03:40:48,660
I had some, you know, I had some Taco Bell earlier.

5175
03:40:49,020 --> 03:40:50,240
I just couldn't...

5176
03:40:50,240 --> 03:40:51,820
You know, I just didn't want you to hear that.

5177
03:40:53,020 --> 03:40:55,140
Snake jumping off a missile is canon to me.

5178
03:40:55,240 --> 03:40:55,780
Me too.

5179
03:40:58,760 --> 03:41:03,200
Also, are we not going to talk about Snake jumping off that missile like Mario jumped off a Bullet Bill?

5180
03:41:03,360 --> 03:41:04,920
We are going to talk about it.

5181
03:41:04,920 --> 03:41:05,640
It was awesome.

5182
03:41:06,360 --> 03:41:08,260
Oh, he's probably still busy, you know.

5183
03:41:08,460 --> 03:41:08,960
It's okay.

5184
03:41:09,060 --> 03:41:09,500
I get it.

5185
03:41:10,500 --> 03:41:11,600
Did you see that?

5186
03:41:11,720 --> 03:41:12,440
Did you see that, Colonel?

5187
03:41:12,440 --> 03:41:13,060
You did it, Snake.

5188
03:41:13,400 --> 03:41:14,780
You shot down the hind.

5189
03:41:14,940 --> 03:41:15,500
I know.

5190
03:41:15,540 --> 03:41:16,200
I was so worried.

5191
03:41:16,800 --> 03:41:18,420
Liquid couldn't have survived that.

5192
03:41:18,520 --> 03:41:19,380
I wonder.

5193
03:41:20,020 --> 03:41:24,800
But even so, just because we've taken out their leader doesn't mean they're going to give up.

5194
03:41:25,040 --> 03:41:27,240
They're still going to try to launch that nuke.

5195
03:41:27,460 --> 03:41:28,140
You're right.

5196
03:41:28,460 --> 03:41:29,620
Dedication is so real.

5197
03:41:29,800 --> 03:41:30,920
Hope you're doing well today, Mint.

5198
03:41:31,000 --> 03:41:31,560
You too, Nun!

5199
03:41:31,720 --> 03:41:33,740
The underground base is past the communications tower.

5200
03:41:34,180 --> 03:41:36,340
The elevator is working again, isn't it?

5201
03:41:36,860 --> 03:41:42,340
I'm glad that you love ace combat probably as much as I love Metal Gear.

5202
03:41:42,340 --> 03:41:43,400
But be careful.

5203
03:41:43,460 --> 03:41:45,200
Don't waste your whole paycheck, you know.

5204
03:41:45,880 --> 03:41:47,180
Snake, stay on the ground.

5205
03:41:48,660 --> 03:41:53,920
If you stop by a burger place while looking for food, maybe you'll run into why Miller couldn't help with that hindy.

5206
03:41:54,360 --> 03:41:57,140
Oh, he was taking care of his food chain.

5207
03:41:57,300 --> 03:41:57,880
You're so right.

5208
03:41:59,620 --> 03:42:00,140
Oh, wait.

5209
03:42:00,640 --> 03:42:04,000
I don't know why, but the elevator just started working again.

5210
03:42:04,460 --> 03:42:09,780
If you take it all the way to the bottom of Tower B and go outside, you'll be in the snow field.

5211
03:42:10,220 --> 03:42:11,200
The snow field.

5212
03:42:11,200 --> 03:42:14,300
The underground maintenance base is in the north of the snow field.

5213
03:42:14,540 --> 03:42:20,080
I was in the kitchen making a snack and I could hear your cheers from my headphones peeking out from my room.

5214
03:42:20,400 --> 03:42:20,920
Sorry.

5215
03:42:22,140 --> 03:42:23,560
Sorry that I'm loud.

5216
03:42:24,640 --> 03:42:26,560
Sorry that I'm a little loud sometimes.

5217
03:42:27,180 --> 03:42:29,160
But you can't blame me, right?

5218
03:42:29,440 --> 03:42:30,360
For cheering.

5219
03:42:31,580 --> 03:42:32,780
There's nothing else here?

5220
03:42:35,120 --> 03:42:36,560
There really isn't...

5221
03:42:36,560 --> 03:42:39,600
I thought I saw something.

5222
03:42:39,760 --> 03:42:39,960
Oh.

5223
03:42:41,440 --> 03:42:46,120
Oh, I was seeing the stuff landing on my camera.

5224
03:42:48,800 --> 03:42:49,240
Okay.

5225
03:42:50,320 --> 03:42:51,400
Let's go take the elevator.

5226
03:42:56,380 --> 03:42:58,360
Here, I'll turn my mic down just a little bit.

5227
03:43:02,400 --> 03:43:03,400
There we go.

5228
03:43:04,660 --> 03:43:05,780
And down we go.

5229
03:43:09,440 --> 03:43:11,520
I had to go attend to some burgers on the stove.

5230
03:43:14,260 --> 03:43:14,960
That guy.

5231
03:43:17,380 --> 03:43:18,760
He's in Burger Town, real.

5232
03:43:22,300 --> 03:43:24,000
Why would they give us Fem...

5233
03:43:24,000 --> 03:43:25,880
Oh, maybe if you use the Femus on the...

5234
03:43:28,320 --> 03:43:30,000
If you use the Femus on the...

5235
03:43:30,540 --> 03:43:30,940
What's the word?

5236
03:43:32,560 --> 03:43:33,360
Oh my goodness.

5237
03:43:33,940 --> 03:43:34,740
The cameras.

5238
03:43:35,620 --> 03:43:37,100
No, be louder, please.

5239
03:43:41,160 --> 03:43:45,660
I didn't notice that my mic was sounding a little bit weird recently.

5240
03:43:45,940 --> 03:43:46,840
Maybe it's just me.

5241
03:43:47,000 --> 03:43:47,500
I don't know.

5242
03:43:53,300 --> 03:43:55,100
I'll work around...

5243
03:43:55,100 --> 03:43:56,120
I'll work on it.

5244
03:43:56,160 --> 03:43:57,680
I'll see what's going on with it.

5245
03:44:03,420 --> 03:44:04,700
They're all still down, right?

5246
03:44:05,760 --> 03:44:07,100
Yeah, they're not moving or anything.

5247
03:44:07,220 --> 03:44:08,960
I mean, they weren't moving before, but...

5248
03:44:09,920 --> 03:44:11,220
Yeah, they're all pointed...

5249
03:44:11,220 --> 03:44:12,240
Yeah, we're good.

5250
03:44:12,400 --> 03:44:12,800
We're good.

5251
03:44:16,060 --> 03:44:17,480
I'm actually kind of low, really.

5252
03:44:17,840 --> 03:44:18,400
Oh, okay.

5253
03:44:19,600 --> 03:44:21,240
Like, I have my compressor on and everything.

5254
03:44:24,600 --> 03:44:25,260
I'm just...

5255
03:44:25,260 --> 03:44:26,600
I just get so energetic, you guys.

5256
03:44:26,660 --> 03:44:26,980
I'm sorry.

5257
03:44:28,480 --> 03:44:29,900
I haven't noticed, really.

5258
03:44:30,220 --> 03:44:30,800
That's good.

5259
03:44:32,820 --> 03:44:33,600
Sounds good.

5260
03:44:34,320 --> 03:44:34,920
That's good.

5261
03:44:39,400 --> 03:44:39,840
Oh...

5262
03:44:39,840 --> 03:44:40,440
Oh...

5263
03:44:40,440 --> 03:44:41,120
Oh...

5264
03:44:41,120 --> 03:44:42,520
Mic sounds fine.

5265
03:44:44,920 --> 03:44:45,740
That is good.

5266
03:44:48,320 --> 03:44:53,180
I feel with how much you love these action cutscenes, you would love the Devil May Cry games.

5267
03:44:54,220 --> 03:44:55,140
I believe you.

5268
03:44:56,800 --> 03:44:58,880
I do love over-the-top action.

5269
03:45:00,460 --> 03:45:01,460
It's so fun.

5270
03:45:05,620 --> 03:45:06,180
Okay.

5271
03:45:07,560 --> 03:45:08,120
I

5272
03:45:11,600 --> 03:45:13,600
love my communications tower ASMR.

5273
03:45:14,160 --> 03:45:14,680
What's this?

5274
03:45:15,460 --> 03:45:15,980
Grenade.

5275
03:45:16,280 --> 03:45:16,980
Oh, nice.

5276
03:45:17,760 --> 03:45:18,760
Yeah, we'll take those.

5277
03:45:19,680 --> 03:45:21,880
And here, we use the FAMAS.

5278
03:45:23,560 --> 03:45:24,720
We got to get ready.

5279
03:45:26,100 --> 03:45:28,080
Oh, there's a ration right there.

5280
03:45:28,800 --> 03:45:30,620
I never noticed it.

5281
03:45:32,100 --> 03:45:32,620
Wow.

5282
03:45:39,980 --> 03:45:41,140
Push the button.

5283
03:45:43,620 --> 03:45:45,100
That's why we have Metal Gear Rising.

5284
03:45:45,220 --> 03:45:45,860
So true.

5285
03:45:46,860 --> 03:45:47,980
Don't forget food time.

5286
03:45:48,000 --> 03:45:48,120
Okay.

5287
03:45:48,120 --> 03:45:48,460
I don't know.

5288
03:45:59,960 --> 03:46:02,440
I hope I don't run into anyone in here.

5289
03:46:03,720 --> 03:46:04,740
There we go.

5290
03:46:07,380 --> 03:46:08,360
It's working though.

5291
03:46:10,720 --> 03:46:11,420
Oh my gosh.

5292
03:46:11,460 --> 03:46:12,140
This is it.

5293
03:46:12,200 --> 03:46:13,720
This is the codec call.

5294
03:46:14,000 --> 03:46:14,260
Snake.

5295
03:46:14,520 --> 03:46:16,560
There's something I forgot to tell you before.

5296
03:46:16,860 --> 03:46:17,340
What?

5297
03:46:17,580 --> 03:46:19,940
There were five stealth camouflagers.

5298
03:46:19,940 --> 03:46:21,420
There were five camouflage prototypes in my lab.

5299
03:46:21,560 --> 03:46:21,880
Yeah?

5300
03:46:22,120 --> 03:46:22,520
So?

5301
03:46:22,880 --> 03:46:26,000
If you take out the one I'm wearing, that leaves four.

5302
03:46:26,200 --> 03:46:28,800
Hey, this isn't first grade math class.

5303
03:46:29,140 --> 03:46:32,400
I thought I'd get one for you, so I went back to the lab and...

5304
03:46:32,400 --> 03:46:32,820
And?

5305
03:46:33,380 --> 03:46:35,180
The four suits were missing.

5306
03:46:37,520 --> 03:46:41,960
Also, about the elevator that I checked out, it's really strange.

5307
03:46:42,480 --> 03:46:45,540
It was like someone was intentionally holding it.

5308
03:46:45,720 --> 03:46:49,060
When you were riding on it, did the weight limit warning go off?

5309
03:46:49,060 --> 03:46:51,580
That's another thing that bothered me about it.

5310
03:46:51,640 --> 03:46:51,760
Yeah?

5311
03:46:52,040 --> 03:46:55,300
The warning went off, and I know I couldn't be over the limit.

5312
03:46:55,320 --> 03:46:55,860
Are you sure?

5313
03:46:55,920 --> 03:46:56,640
How much do you weigh?

5314
03:46:57,220 --> 03:46:58,060
About 135.

5315
03:46:58,400 --> 03:46:59,620
Whoa, he's tiny.

5316
03:46:59,760 --> 03:47:00,440
Skinny baby.

5317
03:47:00,700 --> 03:47:02,000
But that elevator had a weight limit of 650 pounds.

5318
03:47:02,460 --> 03:47:05,180
It would take at least five people to break that limit.

5319
03:47:05,600 --> 03:47:06,720
Look out, Snake.

5320
03:47:06,980 --> 03:47:10,600
The guys who stole my stealth prototypes are in there with you.

5321
03:47:10,700 --> 03:47:11,640
Oh my god!

5322
03:47:12,900 --> 03:47:13,900
No way!

5323
03:47:14,080 --> 03:47:14,840
Oh my god.

5324
03:47:15,060 --> 03:47:15,760
Snake, now die!

5325
03:47:16,680 --> 03:47:17,200
Ah!

5326
03:47:18,520 --> 03:47:19,040
Snake, now die!

5327
03:47:19,060 --> 03:47:20,640
I can't believe they're in here with us!

5328
03:47:26,380 --> 03:47:27,720
I can also shoot!

5329
03:47:27,820 --> 03:47:28,100
Shoot!

5330
03:47:29,520 --> 03:47:30,000
Shoot!

5331
03:47:30,740 --> 03:47:32,100
Oh my god, the spin!

5332
03:47:43,200 --> 03:47:43,680
Okay.

5333
03:47:51,500 --> 03:47:52,440
So true, Snake.

5334
03:47:56,300 --> 03:47:57,780
They were chumps.

5335
03:47:57,880 --> 03:47:58,440
They were.

5336
03:48:06,800 --> 03:48:07,440
Nice.

5337
03:48:11,620 --> 03:48:12,660
I hear...

5338
03:48:12,660 --> 03:48:13,320
I hear a...

5339
03:48:14,740 --> 03:48:16,120
I hear a camera.

5340
03:48:21,730 --> 03:48:22,850
In here, maybe?

5341
03:48:24,090 --> 03:48:24,730
What

5342
03:48:30,220 --> 03:48:30,960
was that?

5343
03:48:36,400 --> 03:48:37,600
What was that over here?

5344
03:48:38,180 --> 03:48:40,820
I guess I should collect everything first, though.

5345
03:48:46,760 --> 03:48:47,680
Oh, I...

5346
03:48:47,680 --> 03:48:49,940
The PSG tranquilizer version.

5347
03:48:51,180 --> 03:48:52,300
Tranq 1.

5348
03:48:55,860 --> 03:48:56,600
PSG bullet.

5349
03:48:57,460 --> 03:48:59,120
Oh, it's this one right here.

5350
03:48:59,500 --> 03:49:00,140
Okay, hold on.

5351
03:49:00,140 --> 03:49:01,240
Maybe I can get it from here.

5352
03:49:03,120 --> 03:49:03,760
Oh, there it is.

5353
03:49:03,860 --> 03:49:03,980
Yeah.

5354
03:49:08,580 --> 03:49:09,000
That's right.

5355
03:49:10,200 --> 03:49:11,240
That's right, buddy.

5356
03:49:11,360 --> 03:49:11,880
That's right.

5357
03:49:19,530 --> 03:49:20,250
Try again.

5358
03:49:22,030 --> 03:49:22,390
Idiot.

5359
03:49:23,030 --> 03:49:23,690
Actually, don't.

5360
03:49:24,150 --> 03:49:24,690
Let me...

5361
03:49:24,690 --> 03:49:25,090
Let me go.

5362
03:49:25,270 --> 03:49:25,710
I just...

5363
03:49:25,710 --> 03:49:26,350
I just wanna live.

5364
03:49:27,550 --> 03:49:28,270
I just...

5365
03:49:28,270 --> 03:49:28,950
I just wanna go.

5366
03:49:29,490 --> 03:49:29,850
Okay.

5367
03:49:29,850 --> 03:49:30,030
Okay.

5368
03:49:30,150 --> 03:49:30,230
Okay.

5369
03:49:30,230 --> 03:49:30,330
Okay.

5370
03:49:50,740 --> 03:49:51,640
Another one right?

5371
03:49:51,800 --> 03:49:52,260
We're good.

5372
03:49:53,880 --> 03:49:54,860
Too late, fool.

5373
03:49:55,000 --> 03:49:57,280
Oh, I thought it was cold medicine.

5374
03:49:58,740 --> 03:50:00,240
I thought it was cold medicine.

5375
03:50:00,500 --> 03:50:02,040
Okay, when the door opens...

5376
03:50:02,040 --> 03:50:04,500
Okay, one of my biggest issues...

5377
03:50:04,500 --> 03:50:05,600
Not one of my biggest.

5378
03:50:05,760 --> 03:50:06,280
It's not the biggest.

5379
03:50:06,440 --> 03:50:11,280
But it's an issue that I really have with specifically the fight with Sniperwolf and the cutscene afterwards.

5380
03:50:11,580 --> 03:50:15,160
In the original, the sky and everything looks like this.

5381
03:50:15,300 --> 03:50:16,080
It looks cold.

5382
03:50:16,220 --> 03:50:17,140
It looks dark.

5383
03:50:17,220 --> 03:50:17,260
It looks...

5384
03:50:17,280 --> 03:50:19,120
It looks like bleak everything.

5385
03:50:19,340 --> 03:50:27,100
And watching Snake walk into the darkness after the fight is one of the coldest things I've ever seen ever.

5386
03:50:27,260 --> 03:50:28,080
It's so awesome.

5387
03:50:28,820 --> 03:50:32,080
But they make it so much brighter.

5388
03:50:32,240 --> 03:50:34,660
But this looks like how it does in the original.

5389
03:50:34,800 --> 03:50:35,520
It looks so good.

5390
03:50:35,960 --> 03:50:36,940
What game is that?

5391
03:50:37,020 --> 03:50:38,280
The original Metal Gear Solid.

5392
03:50:39,080 --> 03:50:40,280
The original, the original.

5393
03:50:43,140 --> 03:50:45,800
Does anyone have to say anything before we continue?

5394
03:50:47,280 --> 03:50:51,940
The underground maintenance base is somewhere towards the back of the snowfield, north of Tower B.

5395
03:50:52,100 --> 03:50:52,460
Okay.

5396
03:50:52,880 --> 03:50:53,840
Thank you.

5397
03:50:54,860 --> 03:50:56,480
Otacon, I'm alive by the way.

5398
03:50:56,740 --> 03:50:59,540
Otacon, which direction is the underground base?

5399
03:50:59,960 --> 03:51:00,880
It's in the snowfield to the north of Tower B.

5400
03:51:00,880 --> 03:51:01,360
Top Cinema.

5401
03:51:01,480 --> 03:51:02,320
It is!

5402
03:51:02,640 --> 03:51:03,340
So awesome.

5403
03:51:03,340 --> 03:51:05,020
The door is security level 6.

5404
03:51:06,620 --> 03:51:07,900
It's so awesome.

5405
03:51:08,220 --> 03:51:09,100
Like, I don't know.

5406
03:51:09,160 --> 03:51:11,460
It just like, creates the atmosphere so well.

5407
03:51:11,560 --> 03:51:13,980
Especially when Otacon is like yelling out to him.

5408
03:51:14,020 --> 03:51:16,200
He's like, what are you fighting for?

5409
03:51:16,720 --> 03:51:17,260
It's so awesome.

5410
03:51:17,260 --> 03:51:17,260
I don't know.

5411
03:51:17,260 --> 03:51:17,260
It just like, creates the atmosphere so well.

5412
03:51:17,260 --> 03:51:17,260
Especially when Otacon is like yelling out to him.

5413
03:51:17,260 --> 03:51:17,260
He's like, what are you fighting for?

5414
03:51:17,280 --> 03:51:18,940
Oh, it just hits different.

5415
03:51:19,820 --> 03:51:21,420
Nostasha, what do you have to say about that?

5416
03:51:22,160 --> 03:51:28,820
As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.

5417
03:51:29,580 --> 03:51:35,580
If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.

5418
03:51:35,920 --> 03:51:38,160
I used to work in the DIA.

5419
03:51:38,680 --> 03:51:47,260
I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence.

5420
03:51:48,200 --> 03:51:48,900
Deterrence?

5421
03:52:00,680 --> 03:52:03,460
Good question.

5422
03:52:22,460 --> 03:52:23,520
Oh my god.

5423
03:52:30,620 --> 03:52:36,520
What about you?

5424
03:52:42,100 --> 03:52:43,780
Are these real stats?

5425
03:52:47,820 --> 03:52:48,300
Hmm.

5426
03:52:54,820 --> 03:52:56,180
Her accent is gone.

5427
03:52:56,260 --> 03:52:57,740
It's mostly gone.

5428
03:52:57,840 --> 03:53:00,060
It's not as heavy, but it's still there a little bit.

5429
03:53:07,660 --> 03:53:11,180
I like Nastasha.

5430
03:53:11,300 --> 03:53:11,880
She's so cool.

5431
03:53:14,040 --> 03:53:14,520
Hmm.

5432
03:53:14,740 --> 03:53:15,660
Might have been even more.

5433
03:53:15,840 --> 03:53:16,500
So sad.

5434
03:53:17,260 --> 03:53:18,080
You called, Snake?

5435
03:53:26,740 --> 03:53:27,740
Uh, yes.

5436
03:53:27,940 --> 03:53:28,160
Okay.

5437
03:53:30,200 --> 03:53:32,940
Alright, let's go fight another boss.

5438
03:53:36,980 --> 03:53:38,600
Oh, you can't say melon.

5439
03:53:38,760 --> 03:53:40,340
Don't adjust your sandals.

5440
03:53:40,700 --> 03:53:45,280
That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.

5441
03:53:45,620 --> 03:53:47,600
Keep things in the proper perspective.

5442
03:53:48,040 --> 03:53:48,560
Okay?

5443
03:53:54,340 --> 03:53:56,600
I don't think I've ever heard her say that one.

5444
03:53:56,720 --> 03:53:57,760
Okay, Gonzalo.

5445
03:53:59,820 --> 03:54:01,640
Time for you to leave, Mei Ling.

5446
03:54:01,800 --> 03:54:03,400
I can't believe you said that.

5447
03:54:04,880 --> 03:54:05,420
To me.

5448
03:54:06,080 --> 03:54:07,300
I did save, right?

5449
03:54:07,400 --> 03:54:08,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saved.

5450
03:54:10,660 --> 03:54:13,140
Time for another ridiculous action cutscene.

5451
03:54:13,620 --> 03:54:14,060
See?

5452
03:54:14,140 --> 03:54:15,220
It just doesn't look as good.

5453
03:54:15,640 --> 03:54:17,560
Just doesn't look as bleak.

5454
03:54:17,560 --> 03:54:18,260
Bleak.

5455
03:54:19,540 --> 03:54:21,060
I don't want to be able to see the sky.

5456
03:54:21,260 --> 03:54:22,580
I want it to be pure darkness.

5457
03:54:24,020 --> 03:54:25,520
Oh my god, that was so loud.

5458
03:54:25,800 --> 03:54:27,000
Oh, that was so loud.

5459
03:54:28,060 --> 03:54:28,580
Ow!

5460
03:54:28,580 --> 03:54:28,900
Ow!

5461
03:54:29,300 --> 03:54:29,820
Ow!

5462
03:54:30,180 --> 03:54:30,280
Ow!

5463
03:54:34,970 --> 03:54:35,490
Jump!

5464
03:54:37,690 --> 03:54:38,810
Oh no, Otacon.

5465
03:54:42,510 --> 03:54:44,030
Snake, are you okay?

5466
03:54:45,030 --> 03:54:47,710
Otacon, were there any other stealth prototypes?

5467
03:54:48,130 --> 03:54:48,410
No!

5468
03:54:48,770 --> 03:54:50,190
There were only five.

5469
03:54:50,550 --> 03:54:51,070
So...

5470
03:54:51,070 --> 03:54:52,750
Nastasha not returning was one of the big losses.

5471
03:54:52,770 --> 03:54:53,450
This isn't stealth camouflage then.

5472
03:54:53,670 --> 03:54:55,190
What are you talking about?

5473
03:54:55,330 --> 03:54:55,870
Arigato, arigato.

5474
03:54:56,030 --> 03:54:57,130
Someone's shooting at me.

5475
03:54:57,250 --> 03:54:57,610
Chuu!

5476
03:54:57,730 --> 03:54:58,730
Can you hear this blizzard?

5477
03:55:00,190 --> 03:55:00,830
It's her!

5478
03:55:02,550 --> 03:55:03,070
Wolf?

5479
03:55:03,070 --> 03:55:03,870
Sniper Wolf?

5480
03:55:04,250 --> 03:55:05,410
Yes, it's her.

5481
03:55:05,610 --> 03:55:06,990
It's definitely her.

5482
03:55:07,270 --> 03:55:10,150
Otacon, you sound like you're happy.

5483
03:55:10,470 --> 03:55:11,870
No, I'm not.

5484
03:55:12,190 --> 03:55:13,290
So then what is it?

5485
03:55:15,930 --> 03:55:17,910
Snake, please don't kill her.

5486
03:55:18,030 --> 03:55:18,630
His glasses.

5487
03:55:18,770 --> 03:55:19,030
Are you insane?

5488
03:55:19,230 --> 03:55:19,750
Please.

5489
03:55:20,470 --> 03:55:21,790
She's a good person.

5490
03:55:22,190 --> 03:55:24,130
You'd know that if you talked to her.

5491
03:55:24,210 --> 03:55:27,130
That woman isn't as sweet as you think.

5492
03:55:27,490 --> 03:55:29,890
I can see you perfectly for me.

5493
03:55:32,110 --> 03:55:33,290
She's so hot.

5494
03:55:33,510 --> 03:55:36,010
I told you, I'd never quit the hunt.

5495
03:55:36,610 --> 03:55:38,330
Now you're mine.

5496
03:55:38,510 --> 03:55:39,750
Otacon, you're- Wolf!

5497
03:55:39,990 --> 03:55:41,530
No, you can't!

5498
03:55:41,670 --> 03:55:43,910
Don't get between a wolf and its prey.

5499
03:55:44,490 --> 03:55:47,050
You're pretty good if you can hit me in this storm.

5500
03:55:47,330 --> 03:55:48,070
You see?

5501
03:55:48,070 --> 03:55:51,170
Women naturally make better soldiers.

5502
03:55:51,590 --> 03:55:53,330
Wolf, don't do this!

5503
03:55:53,350 --> 03:55:54,210
Emotional damage.

5504
03:55:54,530 --> 03:55:55,810
Snake, I'm near.

5505
03:55:56,690 --> 03:55:58,630
Can't you sense me near you?

5506
03:55:59,070 --> 03:56:01,830
It's a mistake for a sniper to reveal her location.

5507
03:56:02,410 --> 03:56:03,630
You think so?

5508
03:56:03,630 --> 03:56:05,230
The tension here is so iso.

5509
03:56:05,230 --> 03:56:07,470
What a message from me is a message from death.

5510
03:56:07,890 --> 03:56:11,750
If I'm close, you will know death is close.

5511
03:56:12,310 --> 03:56:13,350
Please, Wolf!

5512
03:56:13,490 --> 03:56:14,130
Snake!

5513
03:56:14,410 --> 03:56:14,990
No!

5514
03:56:15,270 --> 03:56:15,910
Quiet!

5515
03:56:16,310 --> 03:56:17,630
Don't get in our way.

5516
03:56:17,630 --> 03:56:18,850
That's a different sniper.

5517
03:56:18,970 --> 03:56:20,090
Now I'll pay you back for Meryl.

5518
03:56:20,370 --> 03:56:23,070
You men are so weak.

5519
03:56:23,390 --> 03:56:26,070
You can never finish what you start.

5520
03:56:29,330 --> 03:56:29,970
I'm weak.

5521
03:56:33,430 --> 03:56:35,330
Now, I don't necessarily want to cheese this.

5522
03:56:35,770 --> 03:56:45,150
I think I will- I probably will use the sniper if I can find her first.

5523
03:56:46,130 --> 03:56:51,770
It's like so bra- Oh, there she- I wonder where she is.

5524
03:56:53,730 --> 03:56:55,310
Oh my gosh, it's funny.

5525
03:56:56,190 --> 03:56:58,270
She also kind of runs like Sasquatch.

5526
03:56:58,810 --> 03:56:59,350
Oh my god.

5527
03:56:59,390 --> 03:56:59,730
Ouch!

5528
03:57:01,650 --> 03:57:02,130
Oh.

5529
03:57:03,670 --> 03:57:04,350
Okay, hold on.

5530
03:57:05,990 --> 03:57:06,950
Let's run this way.

5531
03:57:24,200 --> 03:57:26,380
Actually, where- Where is she?

5532
03:57:26,380 --> 03:57:26,720
Oh, wait.

5533
03:57:27,480 --> 03:57:28,340
I saw her.

5534
03:57:29,040 --> 03:57:30,020
Oh, my medicine!

5535
03:57:31,920 --> 03:57:32,360
Where?

5536
03:57:32,480 --> 03:57:33,160
Oh, there, there, there.

5537
03:57:33,840 --> 03:57:34,280
Okay.

5538
03:57:36,740 --> 03:57:37,180
No!

5539
03:57:37,480 --> 03:57:38,340
How did I miss?

5540
03:57:43,710 --> 03:57:44,750
Is she going over here?

5541
03:57:47,750 --> 03:57:48,190
No!

5542
03:57:48,250 --> 03:57:48,990
She doubled back!

5543
03:57:49,490 --> 03:57:50,370
You sneaky!

5544
03:57:52,210 --> 03:57:52,970
Where did she go?

5545
03:57:53,990 --> 03:57:54,790
Where did she go?

5546
03:57:55,990 --> 03:57:56,870
Where is she hiding?

5547
03:57:59,530 --> 03:58:00,210
There she is!

5548
03:58:10,450 --> 03:58:10,890
Back.

5549
03:58:11,110 --> 03:58:11,290
Oh.

5550
03:58:11,350 --> 03:58:11,750
This is so funny.

5551
03:58:11,810 --> 03:58:12,250
Oh.

5552
03:58:12,250 --> 03:58:13,070
It's so sensitive.

5553
03:58:13,290 --> 03:58:13,870
It's so sensitive.

5554
03:58:14,130 --> 03:58:14,290
Wait.

5555
03:58:14,370 --> 03:58:14,930
I don't know where she went.

5556
03:58:15,310 --> 03:58:15,770
Uh-oh.

5557
03:58:16,310 --> 03:58:16,630
Oh.

5558
03:58:16,710 --> 03:58:16,930
Oh.

5559
03:58:17,030 --> 03:58:17,750
There she is.

5560
03:58:17,810 --> 03:58:18,030
Oh.

5561
03:58:18,050 --> 03:58:18,310
Oh.

5562
03:58:18,330 --> 03:58:18,870
I lost her.

5563
03:58:18,930 --> 03:58:19,370
Oh, no.

5564
03:58:21,370 --> 03:58:21,890
Oh, no.

5565
03:58:22,350 --> 03:58:22,670
Hello.

5566
03:58:23,050 --> 03:58:24,090
Where is she running to?

5567
03:58:25,930 --> 03:58:26,430
Oh, no.

5568
03:58:27,250 --> 03:58:27,570
Ah!

5569
03:58:29,470 --> 03:58:30,330
You can't get me.

5570
03:58:32,890 --> 03:58:33,550
You can't get me.

5571
03:58:35,270 --> 03:58:35,590
Okay.

5572
03:58:35,690 --> 03:58:35,950
Uh.

5573
03:58:37,890 --> 03:58:38,550
Run, run, run.

5574
03:58:45,900 --> 03:58:46,860
I don't know where she went.

5575
03:58:47,220 --> 03:58:47,540
I don't know.

5576
03:58:50,710 --> 03:58:56,730
She could... before I saw like the red of her...

5577
03:58:56,730 --> 03:58:57,490
Oh, there.

5578
03:58:57,610 --> 03:58:57,710
There.

5579
03:58:57,770 --> 03:58:58,190
Oh, shoot.

5580
03:58:58,390 --> 03:58:58,770
Oh, shoot.

5581
03:58:58,850 --> 03:58:59,030
Okay.

5582
03:59:00,130 --> 03:59:00,530
Ah!

5583
03:59:05,660 --> 03:59:07,520
She just stayed behind the tree, right?

5584
03:59:14,430 --> 03:59:15,130
Oh, shoot.

5585
03:59:15,190 --> 03:59:15,670
Oh shoot.

5586
03:59:15,970 --> 03:59:16,550
There we go.

5587
03:59:19,070 --> 03:59:20,030
Oh, no, no, no.

5588
03:59:20,270 --> 03:59:21,010
Oh, no.

5589
03:59:22,790 --> 03:59:23,190
You...

5590
03:59:24,130 --> 03:59:24,710
Sniper wolf.

5591
03:59:25,930 --> 03:59:26,610
Sniper wolf.

5592
03:59:26,810 --> 03:59:27,210
Sniper wolf.

5593
03:59:27,230 --> 03:59:28,810
I'll get you while you're running.

5594
03:59:30,210 --> 03:59:31,350
As soon as you come out.

5595
03:59:38,100 --> 03:59:39,940
My alert sounds are adorable.

5596
03:59:40,320 --> 03:59:40,800
What do you mean?

5597
03:59:41,140 --> 03:59:41,740
What do you mean?

5598
03:59:42,580 --> 03:59:44,800
What do you mean by that?

5599
03:59:45,820 --> 03:59:46,780
Oh, dang.

5600
03:59:50,740 --> 03:59:52,060
Come on, Sniper Wolf!

5601
03:59:53,140 --> 03:59:56,030
This way?

5602
03:59:56,150 --> 03:59:56,630
This way?

5603
03:59:58,250 --> 03:59:59,730
Come on, Sniper Wolf!

5604
04:00:05,730 --> 04:00:07,010
Oh my gosh, my aim.

5605
04:00:07,110 --> 04:00:07,670
My aim!

5606
04:00:11,530 --> 04:00:13,050
Even with the Pizazzamine.

5607
04:00:15,510 --> 04:00:16,470
I'm useless.

5608
04:00:19,250 --> 04:00:20,610
It's so sensitive.

5609
04:00:20,950 --> 04:00:21,770
Oh my gosh, please.

5610
04:00:23,190 --> 04:00:24,130
Oh my god.

5611
04:00:24,230 --> 04:00:25,130
Got her.

5612
04:00:26,830 --> 04:00:27,910
Oh my gosh.

5613
04:00:29,490 --> 04:00:30,990
Even with the Pizazzamine.

5614
04:00:31,290 --> 04:00:32,890
Like one millimeter off.

5615
04:00:35,330 --> 04:00:36,010
So crazy.

5616
04:00:37,130 --> 04:00:38,430
Got her.

5617
04:00:42,900 --> 04:00:43,480
Come on, Wolf.

5618
04:00:46,160 --> 04:00:47,500
This is too easy.

5619
04:00:48,100 --> 04:00:49,660
This is actually too easy.

5620
04:00:54,500 --> 04:00:55,420
That's not me!

5621
04:00:55,580 --> 04:00:57,100
That's the Pizazzamine!

5622
04:01:00,380 --> 04:01:02,720
You're invincibility frames, huh?

5623
04:01:02,880 --> 04:01:03,540
Sniper Wolf!

5624
04:01:03,720 --> 04:01:04,760
You're invincibility frames.

5625
04:01:09,640 --> 04:01:11,940
Come on out, pretty lady.

5626
04:01:15,040 --> 04:01:15,780
Easy.

5627
04:01:18,100 --> 04:01:19,060
Come on, man.

5628
04:01:19,100 --> 04:01:19,800
That's too easy.

5629
04:01:19,940 --> 04:01:20,620
It's so easy.

5630
04:01:20,840 --> 04:01:24,040
Actually, I don't remember struggling much with her original fight either, though.

5631
04:01:30,670 --> 04:01:32,010
That was a lot of blood.

5632
04:01:32,870 --> 04:01:33,350
That was a lot of blood.

5633
04:01:33,350 --> 04:01:34,230
And this is why...

5634
04:01:34,230 --> 04:01:39,050
This exactly is why I did not grab the tranquilizer.

5635
04:01:40,190 --> 04:01:41,150
This exactly is why I did not grab the tranquilizer.

5636
04:01:41,150 --> 04:01:42,230
This is why I went back to the armory.

5637
04:01:42,390 --> 04:01:43,410
Only for this scene.

5638
04:01:44,330 --> 04:01:45,930
Otherwise this scene would be useless.

5639
04:01:46,970 --> 04:01:47,890
I mean, pointless.

5640
04:01:47,890 --> 04:01:48,170
I mean, pointless.

5641
04:01:49,810 --> 04:01:50,470
No!

5642
04:01:53,720 --> 04:01:54,920
She's so awesome.

5643
04:02:01,570 --> 04:02:03,650
Snake, stop standing in...

5644
04:02:03,650 --> 04:02:04,850
Snake, stop standing in...

5645
04:02:04,850 --> 04:02:06,150
Stop standing in places!

5646
04:02:07,070 --> 04:02:08,110
Like, actually!

5647
04:02:09,390 --> 04:02:10,290
Oh my god.

5648
04:02:11,650 --> 04:02:12,310
Yeah!

5649
04:02:14,970 --> 04:02:15,630
Oh!

5650
04:02:17,710 --> 04:02:18,370
Oh!

5651
04:02:18,390 --> 04:02:18,570
Oh!

5652
04:02:23,430 --> 04:02:24,710
No scope!

5653
04:02:25,370 --> 04:02:27,310
360 no scope, literally!

5654
04:02:28,410 --> 04:02:29,470
He flipped!

5655
04:02:32,130 --> 04:02:32,930
He did a flip!

5656
04:02:43,540 --> 04:02:46,300
Oh, because my headshots did nothing, you know?

5657
04:02:49,280 --> 04:02:51,180
Somersault 360 with scope.

5658
04:02:53,680 --> 04:02:54,960
I don't remember that.

5659
04:02:55,020 --> 04:02:56,240
Welcome to the Twin Snakes.

5660
04:03:00,740 --> 04:03:01,180
Oh...

5661
04:03:05,520 --> 04:03:05,960
Oh!

5662
04:03:08,460 --> 04:03:10,060
See if there's anything around here.

5663
04:03:10,240 --> 04:03:12,460
I think I can also loot after the scene, though.

5664
04:03:15,300 --> 04:03:16,180
Oh, Otacon.

5665
04:03:17,180 --> 04:03:17,620
Oh, Otacon.

5666
04:03:17,620 --> 04:03:18,200
Otacon, don't look.

5667
04:03:21,200 --> 04:03:22,080
Otacon, don't look.

5668
04:03:22,160 --> 04:03:23,040
Otacon will remember that.

5669
04:03:23,080 --> 04:03:23,200
No!

5670
04:03:23,400 --> 04:03:23,920
Don't look!

5671
04:03:24,280 --> 04:03:25,220
Don't look, Otacon.

5672
04:03:28,650 --> 04:03:31,590
But this scene without the besties yet to come in the background is...

5673
04:03:31,590 --> 04:03:31,690
But this scene without the besties yet to come in the background is...

5674
04:03:31,710 --> 04:03:31,990
Not.

5675
04:03:33,410 --> 04:03:35,050
But it still makes me so sad.

5676
04:03:35,530 --> 04:03:36,970
I am a sniper.

5677
04:03:37,870 --> 04:03:39,550
Waiting is my job.

5678
04:03:42,110 --> 04:03:43,930
Never moving a muscle.

5679
04:03:45,510 --> 04:03:46,190
Concentrating.

5680
04:03:47,610 --> 04:03:48,710
Oh my god!

5681
04:03:48,890 --> 04:03:52,430
I am lungshot.

5682
04:03:52,710 --> 04:03:54,570
You cannot save me.

5683
04:03:55,530 --> 04:03:56,210
Please.

5684
04:03:56,990 --> 04:03:58,890
Just finish me quick.

5685
04:04:00,050 --> 04:04:01,910
I am a Kurd.

5686
04:04:02,710 --> 04:04:03,570
I am a Kurd.

5687
04:04:03,570 --> 04:04:06,350
I have always dreamed of a peaceful place like this.

5688
04:04:06,850 --> 04:04:07,550
I am a Kurd.

5689
04:04:07,910 --> 04:04:08,950
A Kurd?

5690
04:04:09,630 --> 04:04:11,510
So that's why you're called Wolf.

5691
04:04:12,910 --> 04:04:15,770
I was born on a battlefield.

5692
04:04:17,410 --> 04:04:18,910
Raised on a battlefield.

5693
04:04:21,010 --> 04:04:23,210
Gunfire, sirens, and screams.

5694
04:04:23,710 --> 04:04:23,930
Gunfire, sirens, and screams.

5695
04:04:23,930 --> 04:04:24,050
Gunfire, sirens, and screams.

5696
04:04:24,470 --> 04:04:26,590
They were my lullabies.

5697
04:04:26,670 --> 04:04:26,870
They were my lullabies.

5698
04:04:27,930 --> 04:04:30,530
Hunted like dogs day after day.

5699
04:04:31,590 --> 04:04:33,850
Driven from our ragged shelters.

5700
04:04:35,670 --> 04:04:38,270
That was my life.

5701
04:04:39,190 --> 04:04:46,090
Each morning I'd wake up and find a few more of my family or friends dead beside me.

5702
04:04:46,990 --> 04:04:51,590
I'd stare at the morning sun and pray to make it through the day.

5703
04:04:53,970 --> 04:04:56,850
The governments of the world turned a blind eye to me.

5704
04:04:56,850 --> 04:04:57,890
And I to our misery.

5705
04:04:58,570 --> 04:04:59,930
But then...

5706
04:05:00,750 --> 04:05:01,770
He appeared.

5707
04:05:02,450 --> 04:05:03,690
My hero.

5708
04:05:04,910 --> 04:05:05,750
Saladin.

5709
04:05:06,450 --> 04:05:08,810
He took me away from all that.

5710
04:05:09,510 --> 04:05:10,350
Saladin?

5711
04:05:10,630 --> 04:05:12,250
You mean Big Boss?

5712
04:05:15,190 --> 04:05:17,610
I became a sniper.

5713
04:05:18,410 --> 04:05:19,250
Hidden.

5714
04:05:20,590 --> 04:05:23,090
Watching everything through a rifle scope.

5715
04:05:24,510 --> 04:05:26,570
Now I could see worse.

5716
04:05:26,850 --> 04:05:28,050
Not from the inside.

5717
04:05:28,490 --> 04:05:30,390
But from the outside.

5718
04:05:30,610 --> 04:05:32,150
As an observer.

5719
04:05:34,590 --> 04:05:36,810
I watched the brutality.

5720
04:05:37,570 --> 04:05:42,730
The stupidity of mankind through the scope of my rifle.

5721
04:05:53,190 --> 04:05:59,190
I joined this group of revolutionaries to take my revenge on the world.

5722
04:05:59,530 --> 04:06:00,410
I joined this group of revolutionaries to take my revenge on the world.

5723
04:06:00,430 --> 04:06:01,890
Oh, even this small guy.

5724
04:06:02,370 --> 04:06:05,550
I have shamed myself and my people.

5725
04:06:06,450 --> 04:06:09,570
I am no longer the wolf I was born to be.

5726
04:06:10,670 --> 04:06:15,310
In the name of vengeance, I sold my body and my soul.

5727
04:06:15,770 --> 04:06:20,210
Now, I am nothing more than a dog.

5728
04:06:23,470 --> 04:06:24,910
Wolves are noble animals.

5729
04:06:25,310 --> 04:06:26,610
They're not like dogs.

5730
04:06:27,030 --> 04:06:27,930
So gentle.

5731
04:06:27,930 --> 04:06:30,150
The word for wolf is Keglanek.

5732
04:06:30,310 --> 04:06:32,750
And the Aleuts revere them as honorable cousins.

5733
04:06:33,970 --> 04:06:36,750
They call mercenaries like us dogs of war.

5734
04:06:37,570 --> 04:06:38,350
It's true.

5735
04:06:38,810 --> 04:06:41,170
We're all for sale for some price or another.

5736
04:06:41,550 --> 04:06:44,230
It's when Otacon comes in that makes me really cry.

5737
04:06:45,010 --> 04:06:45,070
It's when Otacon comes in that makes me really cry.

5738
04:06:45,070 --> 04:06:45,250
Untamed.

5739
04:06:45,270 --> 04:06:45,850
Solitary.

5740
04:06:46,690 --> 04:06:47,830
You're no dog.

5741
04:06:48,550 --> 04:06:49,490
You're a wolf.

5742
04:06:49,750 --> 04:06:50,130
No.

5743
04:06:51,730 --> 04:06:52,310
No.

5744
04:06:54,750 --> 04:06:56,250
Who are you?

5745
04:06:56,250 --> 04:06:56,370
Are you...

5746
04:06:57,110 --> 04:06:58,570
Are you Saladin?

5747
04:06:59,470 --> 04:07:00,150
Wolf.

5748
04:07:00,610 --> 04:07:02,750
You spared Meryl's life.

5749
04:07:04,070 --> 04:07:09,910
Even when I'm just an onlooker, I don't like to see women or children get hurt.

5750
04:07:10,630 --> 04:07:11,590
Rest easy.

5751
04:07:12,230 --> 04:07:14,410
You'll die as the proud wolf you are.

5752
04:07:14,410 --> 04:07:15,530
Who are you, wolf?

5753
04:07:16,910 --> 04:07:18,410
I finally understand.

5754
04:07:19,970 --> 04:07:22,270
I wasn't waiting to kill people.

5755
04:07:22,270 --> 04:07:26,770
I was waiting for someone to kill me.

5756
04:07:28,090 --> 04:07:29,810
So fortune-like.

5757
04:07:29,830 --> 04:07:30,510
A man like you.

5758
04:07:32,890 --> 04:07:34,290
You're a hero.

5759
04:07:36,030 --> 04:07:36,430
Please.

5760
04:07:37,270 --> 04:07:38,830
Set me free.

5761
04:07:42,130 --> 04:07:42,830
Oh no.

5762
04:07:49,410 --> 04:07:53,430
Little dummy.

5763
04:07:54,870 --> 04:07:55,390
Why?

5764
04:07:59,090 --> 04:08:00,530
I loved you.

5765
04:08:08,150 --> 04:08:09,070
What is it?

5766
04:08:09,710 --> 04:08:11,110
This part's so sad too.

5767
04:08:12,910 --> 04:08:14,270
Give it to me.

5768
04:08:14,310 --> 04:08:15,730
She's not even reaching out to Otacon.

5769
04:08:16,110 --> 04:08:19,230
She just wants her gun.

5770
04:08:19,390 --> 04:08:20,870
She doesn't care about you, Otacon.

5771
04:08:25,440 --> 04:08:27,200
She is part of me.

5772
04:08:29,880 --> 04:08:30,400
Ah!

5773
04:08:32,700 --> 04:08:33,380
Ah!

5774
04:08:33,760 --> 04:08:35,280
It sounded like the willow scream.

5775
04:08:37,140 --> 04:08:37,820
Oh

5776
04:08:40,920 --> 04:08:41,280
my gosh.

5777
04:08:41,320 --> 04:08:42,740
These dogs look so goofy.

5778
04:08:42,900 --> 04:08:45,120
The tiny dog looks so happy.

5779
04:08:45,200 --> 04:08:45,840
Like a kid.

5780
04:08:46,140 --> 04:08:47,140
Oh gosh.

5781
04:08:50,720 --> 04:08:52,580
Everyone is here now.

5782
04:08:56,880 --> 04:08:58,240
Okay, hero.

5783
04:08:59,900 --> 04:09:01,460
Set me free.

5784
04:09:06,260 --> 04:09:06,940
Goodbye.

5785
04:09:07,640 --> 04:09:08,180
No.

5786
04:09:42,640 --> 04:09:43,200
Snake.

5787
04:09:43,580 --> 04:09:43,920
Snake.

5788
04:09:44,820 --> 04:09:47,620
You said that love could bloom on a battlefield.

5789
04:09:48,200 --> 04:09:48,440
You said that love could bloom on a battlefield.

5790
04:09:55,940 --> 04:09:57,380
I mean, I didn't miss...

5791
04:09:57,380 --> 04:09:59,140
I couldn't save her.

5792
04:10:00,040 --> 04:10:01,800
I didn't say between you two.

5793
04:10:02,240 --> 04:10:02,260
I didn't say between you two.

5794
04:10:03,240 --> 04:10:05,240
No, I was just saying in general.

5795
04:10:11,180 --> 04:10:12,420
Oh, the handkerchief.

5796
04:10:12,420 --> 04:10:13,080
What are you doing?

5797
04:10:16,340 --> 04:10:17,640
Returning it to its owner.

5798
04:10:17,960 --> 04:10:19,400
I don't need a handkerchief.

5799
04:10:19,400 --> 04:10:20,160
Why?

5800
04:10:23,520 --> 04:10:25,900
I don't have any more tears to shed.

5801
04:10:29,440 --> 04:10:30,940
He cries more.

5802
04:10:32,980 --> 04:10:34,780
I'm going to the underground base.

5803
04:10:35,060 --> 04:10:36,200
We're out of time.

5804
04:10:38,080 --> 04:10:38,960
I know.

5805
04:10:40,120 --> 04:10:42,140
You'll have to protect yourself now.

5806
04:10:42,560 --> 04:10:44,120
Don't trust anyone.

5807
04:10:45,340 --> 04:10:46,400
You too, Snake.

5808
04:10:46,400 --> 04:10:46,520
Yeah.

5809
04:10:47,120 --> 04:10:51,060
If I can't stop Metal Gear, this whole place will be bombed to hell.

5810
04:10:54,220 --> 04:10:54,700
Yeah.

5811
04:10:56,660 --> 04:10:58,060
We might not meet again.

5812
04:10:59,940 --> 04:11:01,480
Don't lose the codec.

5813
04:11:01,920 --> 04:11:03,640
I'll be behind you all the way.

5814
04:11:07,080 --> 04:11:08,400
I hope I don't...

5815
04:11:08,400 --> 04:11:10,320
I hope I don't lose the codec.

5816
04:11:10,400 --> 04:11:11,440
It's in my ear.

5817
04:11:11,820 --> 04:11:13,720
A head start on your new life.

5818
04:11:23,960 --> 04:11:24,700
This...

5819
04:11:24,700 --> 04:11:25,240
This...

5820
04:11:30,000 --> 04:11:30,740
Snake!

5821
04:11:35,360 --> 04:11:37,380
What was she fighting for?

5822
04:11:41,640 --> 04:11:42,560
What was she fighting for?

5823
04:11:42,560 --> 04:11:43,620
What am I fighting for?

5824
04:11:46,180 --> 04:11:47,100
What am I fighting for?

5825
04:11:47,100 --> 04:11:48,400
What are you fighting for?

5826
04:11:53,650 --> 04:11:56,990
If we make it through this, I'll tell you.

5827
04:11:59,010 --> 04:11:59,380
Okay.

5828
04:12:00,670 --> 04:12:01,410
Okay.

5829
04:12:02,870 --> 04:12:04,370
Okay.

5830
04:12:05,350 --> 04:12:07,150
I'll be searching too.

5831
04:12:07,570 --> 04:12:08,370
I'll be searching too.

5832
04:12:13,110 --> 04:12:13,910
Okay.

5833
04:12:15,730 --> 04:12:17,110
I love it.

5834
04:12:21,710 --> 04:12:23,070
I love it.

5835
04:12:23,830 --> 04:12:24,230
Okay.

5836
04:12:26,630 --> 04:12:28,850
I love that light so much.

5837
04:12:29,010 --> 04:12:29,090
I love that light so much.

5838
04:12:29,090 --> 04:12:30,390
Oh my gosh.

5839
04:12:31,470 --> 04:12:32,270
Aww.

5840
04:12:32,930 --> 04:12:33,730
Aww.

5841
04:12:35,970 --> 04:12:37,350
Oh, a sniper wolf.

5842
04:12:37,810 --> 04:12:38,950
I'm sorry.

5843
04:12:39,650 --> 04:12:41,210
I'm sorry, Otacon.

5844
04:12:41,530 --> 04:12:41,990
I'm sorry.

5845
04:12:42,370 --> 04:12:43,690
Wait a second.

5846
04:12:46,270 --> 04:12:47,010
Um...

5847
04:12:49,110 --> 04:12:51,090
Wait a second.

5848
04:12:52,910 --> 04:12:55,030
I recognize this place.

5849
04:12:57,970 --> 04:12:58,710
Uh

5850
04:13:09,480 --> 04:13:09,600
-oh.

5851
04:13:09,620 --> 04:13:10,420
Don't stand up, Snake.

5852
04:13:10,620 --> 04:13:11,860
Snake, don't stand up.

5853
04:13:12,840 --> 04:13:13,400
Oh.

5854
04:13:13,780 --> 04:13:14,340
Uh...

5855
04:13:14,340 --> 04:13:15,580
Oh, I'm awful.

5856
04:13:15,840 --> 04:13:16,220
Okay.

5857
04:13:18,280 --> 04:13:19,880
This death trap.

5858
04:13:21,380 --> 04:13:22,740
The VTuber room.

5859
04:13:22,780 --> 04:13:23,900
It actually is though.

5860
04:13:23,960 --> 04:13:25,880
I think everyone who plays this...

5861
04:13:25,880 --> 04:13:27,300
Who's never played it before.

5862
04:13:27,640 --> 04:13:28,860
Get her dog tag.

5863
04:13:28,940 --> 04:13:29,660
How do I get that?

5864
04:13:36,650 --> 04:13:37,210
Oh.

5865
04:13:37,650 --> 04:13:38,210
Hello.

5866
04:13:41,630 --> 04:13:43,210
What am I fighting for?

5867
04:13:43,210 --> 04:13:45,770
Even with the music cinematic change from the PS1.

5868
04:13:46,510 --> 04:13:48,550
This scene still hits all the emotions.

5869
04:13:48,730 --> 04:13:49,090
It does.

5870
04:13:49,870 --> 04:13:50,670
Yeah, actually.

5871
04:13:50,910 --> 04:13:52,570
Wait, I'm stuck on top of her?

5872
04:13:54,050 --> 04:13:54,570
Loot her.

5873
04:13:59,000 --> 04:13:59,400
Aww.

5874
04:13:59,600 --> 04:14:00,480
He's here though.

5875
04:14:00,620 --> 04:14:01,480
I can't loot her.

5876
04:14:01,540 --> 04:14:02,220
I can't pick her up.

5877
04:14:02,420 --> 04:14:03,100
Wait, is it B?

5878
04:14:03,300 --> 04:14:04,400
How do I pick them up again?

5879
04:14:04,620 --> 04:14:04,960
No.

5880
04:14:05,940 --> 04:14:06,340
No.

5881
04:14:06,840 --> 04:14:07,240
A?

5882
04:14:07,420 --> 04:14:08,100
Oh, here we go.

5883
04:14:08,680 --> 04:14:09,360
Oh my god.

5884
04:14:09,400 --> 04:14:10,380
This is so messed up.

5885
04:14:10,840 --> 04:14:11,680
Oh my god.

5886
04:14:11,700 --> 04:14:12,580
This is so messed up.

5887
04:14:13,500 --> 04:14:14,340
Oh my god.

5888
04:14:15,740 --> 04:14:16,460
Sniper Wolf.

5889
04:14:18,600 --> 04:14:20,120
I'm gonna put her back where she belongs.

5890
04:14:20,300 --> 04:14:20,660
Here.

5891
04:14:20,900 --> 04:14:21,600
Let's just...

5892
04:14:22,220 --> 04:14:22,580
Okay.

5893
04:14:22,580 --> 04:14:23,100
Hold on.

5894
04:14:25,380 --> 04:14:26,100
Just uh...

5895
04:14:27,240 --> 04:14:27,600
Okay.

5896
04:14:28,100 --> 04:14:28,620
Hold on.

5897
04:14:28,640 --> 04:14:29,540
Let me match it up.

5898
04:14:29,980 --> 04:14:30,520
Hold on.

5899
04:14:32,600 --> 04:14:32,960
Okay.

5900
04:14:35,260 --> 04:14:35,900
Oh shoot.

5901
04:14:36,000 --> 04:14:36,220
Okay.

5902
04:14:36,280 --> 04:14:36,540
Hold on.

5903
04:14:37,020 --> 04:14:37,960
Just a little bit more.

5904
04:14:41,760 --> 04:14:42,120
Okay.

5905
04:14:42,120 --> 04:14:42,660
Hold on.

5906
04:14:42,720 --> 04:14:43,000
Hold on.

5907
04:14:43,000 --> 04:14:43,160
Hold on.

5908
04:14:43,220 --> 04:14:45,220
I gotta match it up so it doesn't, you know...

5909
04:14:45,960 --> 04:14:46,280
Okay.

5910
04:14:46,380 --> 04:14:46,600
Okay.

5911
04:14:46,660 --> 04:14:46,880
Hold on.

5912
04:14:46,980 --> 04:14:47,900
I gotta just uh...

5913
04:14:49,000 --> 04:14:51,140
Look for the hindy wreckage in first person.

5914
04:14:51,280 --> 04:14:52,120
Oh, you can see that.

5915
04:14:52,500 --> 04:14:52,980
Hold on.

5916
04:14:53,060 --> 04:14:53,420
Hold on.

5917
04:14:53,440 --> 04:14:53,960
I'm gonna get it.

5918
04:14:54,000 --> 04:14:54,560
I'm gonna get it, puppy.

5919
04:14:54,680 --> 04:14:55,120
I'm gonna get it.

5920
04:14:56,480 --> 04:14:56,800
Okay.

5921
04:14:56,800 --> 04:14:57,020
Hold on.

5922
04:14:57,640 --> 04:14:57,960
Okay.

5923
04:14:58,000 --> 04:14:58,240
Hold on.

5924
04:14:58,340 --> 04:14:58,500
Oh.

5925
04:14:58,620 --> 04:14:58,940
Oh.

5926
04:14:59,040 --> 04:14:59,240
Oh.

5927
04:14:59,260 --> 04:14:59,440
Oh.

5928
04:15:00,160 --> 04:15:00,800
And uh...

5929
04:15:00,800 --> 04:15:01,280
Wait.

5930
04:15:01,740 --> 04:15:02,060
Like...

5931
04:15:03,240 --> 04:15:03,560
That.

5932
04:15:10,150 --> 04:15:10,930
Oh, what's that sound?

5933
04:15:13,830 --> 04:15:14,430
I think...

5934
04:15:14,430 --> 04:15:16,630
I think I...

5935
04:15:16,630 --> 04:15:18,830
I think I glitched the game.

5936
04:15:22,550 --> 04:15:25,310
You could still hear the sounds of me pulling her, I think.

5937
04:15:26,190 --> 04:15:26,590
You could still hear the sounds of me pulling her, I think.

5938
04:15:26,590 --> 04:15:27,930
Unless... Unless this is a different sound.

5939
04:15:28,110 --> 04:15:28,710
Unless this is a different sound.

5940
04:15:30,030 --> 04:15:30,770
Thank you!

5941
04:15:31,790 --> 04:15:35,310
Just because you're a ghost, you can't just disrespect a dead like that, Mint?

5942
04:15:35,530 --> 04:15:35,550
Just because you're a ghost, you can't just disrespect a dead like that, Mint?

5943
04:15:35,550 --> 04:15:37,030
Is there no afterlife decency?

5944
04:15:37,450 --> 04:15:39,610
No one treated my body with decency!

5945
04:15:41,210 --> 04:15:42,210
Actually, I don't know what...

5946
04:15:42,210 --> 04:15:44,190
It was so long ago, I don't know what happened to my body.

5947
04:15:45,590 --> 04:15:47,870
I don't see the... Oh, let me try the scope.

5948
04:15:57,500 --> 04:15:59,180
I can't see anything now.

5949
04:16:12,740 --> 04:16:14,000
Where would it be?

5950
04:16:15,860 --> 04:16:16,880
Where would it be at?

5951
04:16:19,280 --> 04:16:20,140
It's so windy.

5952
04:16:24,200 --> 04:16:25,100
Towards the south?

5953
04:16:30,340 --> 04:16:31,760
This isn't where I go.

5954
04:16:51,270 --> 04:16:52,690
Just in case.

5955
04:16:58,030 --> 04:16:59,990
Oh, it's more chaffs.

5956
04:17:01,190 --> 04:17:03,270
Which I didn't use any of, which is crazy.

5957
04:17:03,930 --> 04:17:05,190
More towards the south.

5958
04:17:06,170 --> 04:17:07,090
Like down here?

5959
04:17:07,290 --> 04:17:08,030
Oh, down here?

5960
04:17:14,200 --> 04:17:15,320
This way?

5961
04:17:17,500 --> 04:17:18,620
The paranoia.

5962
04:17:20,420 --> 04:17:22,200
Let's try going up.

5963
04:17:24,710 --> 04:17:26,260
Is that gold medicine?

5964
04:17:27,690 --> 04:17:29,200
Oh, it's a bandage.

5965
04:17:39,510 --> 04:17:40,730
Nothing here.

5966
04:17:41,230 --> 04:17:42,410
To the right side.

5967
04:17:42,770 --> 04:17:43,650
Wait, like...

5968
04:17:43,650 --> 04:17:45,150
Is this right?

5969
04:17:45,410 --> 04:17:45,810
Which right?

5970
04:17:46,050 --> 04:17:46,690
Who's right?

5971
04:17:48,630 --> 04:17:49,770
Who's right?

5972
04:17:52,270 --> 04:17:54,030
Right side beyond the fence.

5973
04:18:03,560 --> 04:18:04,560
Snake is right.

5974
04:18:04,880 --> 04:18:05,180
Huh?

5975
04:18:12,860 --> 04:18:13,660
Look at this.

5976
04:18:14,960 --> 04:18:15,880
Are they gonna see me?

5977
04:18:19,920 --> 04:18:21,560
From the mini-map bottom right.

5978
04:18:21,700 --> 04:18:22,700
Okay, okay, give me a second.

5979
04:18:22,940 --> 04:18:23,920
I'll grab them.

5980
04:18:24,040 --> 04:18:25,180
Or I'll go look in a second.

5981
04:18:26,720 --> 04:18:27,440
There's the other one.

5982
04:18:29,680 --> 04:18:30,620
There you go.

5983
04:18:38,550 --> 04:18:39,390
More bandage.

5984
04:18:40,310 --> 04:18:41,230
Full on rap.

5985
04:18:41,290 --> 04:18:42,670
This game is so generous.

5986
04:18:42,930 --> 04:18:43,870
Holy cow.

5987
04:18:44,810 --> 04:18:45,610
Holy cow.

5988
04:18:45,890 --> 04:18:46,590
Okay, so this way.

5989
04:18:47,930 --> 04:18:50,550
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

5990
04:18:51,210 --> 04:18:52,170
La, la, la.

5991
04:18:52,890 --> 04:18:53,710
La, la, la.

5992
04:18:55,250 --> 04:18:55,730
Here?

5993
04:18:58,470 --> 04:19:01,230
I can't see over the dang fence.

5994
04:19:04,730 --> 04:19:05,570
Maybe up here?

5995
04:19:05,850 --> 04:19:06,470
Oh, wait.

5996
04:19:06,730 --> 04:19:07,910
That was down there.

5997
04:19:08,170 --> 04:19:08,650
Hahaha.

5998
04:19:09,230 --> 04:19:09,890
Over here?

5999
04:19:14,800 --> 04:19:15,280
Hmm.

6000
04:19:18,240 --> 04:19:19,280
I saw it.

6001
04:19:19,640 --> 04:19:20,120
Oh!

6002
04:19:20,560 --> 04:19:21,040
Huh?

6003
04:19:21,300 --> 04:19:22,080
Oh my gosh!

6004
04:19:22,880 --> 04:19:23,360
Hahaha.

6005
04:19:23,780 --> 04:19:24,680
There it was.

6006
04:19:25,160 --> 04:19:26,660
Colonel, listen to me.

6007
04:19:26,820 --> 04:19:29,300
I found a parachute near the wreckage of the hind.

6008
04:19:29,580 --> 04:19:30,540
A parachute?

6009
04:19:31,100 --> 04:19:32,760
You don't think the liquid survived?

6010
04:19:33,640 --> 04:19:34,400
No way.

6011
04:19:34,820 --> 04:19:36,980
He'd be mad to try to escape by parachute.

6012
04:19:37,340 --> 04:19:41,060
As soon as he jumped out of the pilot's seat, he'd be cut to ribbons by the rotor blades.

6013
04:19:41,060 --> 04:19:41,300
Oh!

6014
04:19:41,880 --> 04:19:44,060
So what's that parachute doing there, then?

6015
04:19:44,180 --> 04:19:45,300
I have no idea.

6016
04:19:46,200 --> 04:19:47,520
He's dog food now.

6017
04:19:47,680 --> 04:19:47,800
A trap?

6018
04:19:47,800 --> 04:19:48,720
Either that or a message.

6019
04:19:49,080 --> 04:19:49,700
To me.

6020
04:19:50,860 --> 04:19:53,480
Meaning I'm not dead, I suppose?

6021
04:19:54,160 --> 04:19:54,600
No.

6022
04:19:54,780 --> 04:19:55,080
Maybe.

6023
04:19:55,380 --> 04:19:58,080
But I think it's more like I'll string you up.

6024
04:19:58,200 --> 04:19:58,740
No, I...

6025
04:19:59,760 --> 04:20:00,520
Well, in any case...

6026
04:20:00,520 --> 04:20:01,380
We took care of that guy.

6027
04:20:01,400 --> 04:20:02,380
Don't let your guard down.

6028
04:20:02,580 --> 04:20:02,940
I won't.

6029
04:20:02,940 --> 04:20:03,880
We took care of that guy.

6030
04:20:03,940 --> 04:20:04,580
He's not coming back.

6031
04:20:05,680 --> 04:20:06,980
We took care of Licklin.

6032
04:20:08,360 --> 04:20:09,620
I've never seen that before, though.

6033
04:20:09,640 --> 04:20:10,120
That's so interesting.

6034
04:20:11,620 --> 04:20:12,060
Oh,

6035
04:20:15,080 --> 04:20:16,460
oh, stop snake.

6036
04:20:18,160 --> 04:20:19,200
You're embarrassing me.

6037
04:20:21,940 --> 04:20:22,380
There's...

6038
04:20:22,380 --> 04:20:24,300
Okay, this is the way that we...

6039
04:20:24,300 --> 04:20:25,340
There's also here.

6040
04:20:25,660 --> 04:20:28,680
I know this is all just gathering supplies and a lot of it we...

6041
04:20:28,680 --> 04:20:29,160
Wow!

6042
04:20:29,500 --> 04:20:31,760
I was going to say a lot of it we already have, but...

6043
04:20:32,240 --> 04:20:32,680
Wow!

6044
04:20:38,970 --> 04:20:39,410
Okay.

6045
04:20:45,140 --> 04:20:46,700
Yeah, we're like so full and...

6046
04:20:46,700 --> 04:20:48,340
We got box number three!

6047
04:20:50,940 --> 04:20:51,420
Two!

6048
04:20:52,140 --> 04:20:53,540
The snow field!

6049
04:20:54,340 --> 04:20:56,160
Oh my gosh, there's a little snowflake on it.

6050
04:20:56,160 --> 04:20:56,600
So cute!

6051
04:20:58,220 --> 04:20:59,420
Cold medicine doco.

6052
04:20:59,660 --> 04:21:01,280
I don't think we're sick anymore, are we?

6053
04:21:01,840 --> 04:21:02,900
Can't tell anymore.

6054
04:21:03,520 --> 04:21:05,100
I guess we're fine now.

6055
04:21:05,300 --> 04:21:07,060
We have a good... the nanomachines worked!

6056
04:21:07,300 --> 04:21:09,360
Oh my god, the nanomachines mutated.

6057
04:21:10,160 --> 04:21:10,880
Oh, whoops.

6058
04:21:11,600 --> 04:21:13,860
The nanomachines have mutated into...

6059
04:21:13,860 --> 04:21:16,680
Oh my gosh, they cure all sorts of diseases!

6060
04:21:19,760 --> 04:21:21,260
Naomi, you wouldn't believe it!

6061
04:21:21,660 --> 04:21:22,560
I think...

6062
04:21:23,480 --> 04:21:24,620
I think it's incredible!

6063
04:21:26,280 --> 04:21:29,480
How... how advanced they've become in such a short amount of time!

6064
04:21:30,420 --> 04:21:31,220
Is that it?

6065
04:21:31,260 --> 04:21:31,560
Right there?

6066
04:21:36,320 --> 04:21:37,280
Disc 2!

6067
04:21:40,340 --> 04:21:46,500
It's rumored that Kojima ended Solid Snake's story at MGS4 because he wanted to focus more on Big Boss' story in later games.

6068
04:21:46,920 --> 04:21:48,220
What's your opinion on this?

6069
04:21:49,740 --> 04:21:50,660
I mean...

6070
04:21:52,020 --> 04:21:54,480
I think Snake told his whole story, though.

6071
04:21:55,240 --> 04:21:56,120
To be honest.

6072
04:21:57,940 --> 04:21:59,640
The blast furnace!

6073
04:22:00,440 --> 04:22:02,740
Oh my gosh, how could I forget about this part?

6074
04:22:13,970 --> 04:22:14,970
That was...

6075
04:22:14,970 --> 04:22:15,510
Who's there?

6076
04:22:15,710 --> 04:22:15,970
No one?

6077
04:22:16,550 --> 04:22:17,250
No one.

6078
04:22:17,930 --> 04:22:18,550
Hold on.

6079
04:22:18,650 --> 04:22:20,110
You don't have a...

6080
04:22:29,700 --> 04:22:30,200
Okay.

6081
04:22:30,580 --> 04:22:31,780
It's so loud in here.

6082
04:22:31,780 --> 04:22:32,940
Holy cow.

6083
04:22:37,140 --> 04:22:38,300
What was that sound?

6084
04:22:39,520 --> 04:22:40,420
Oh my gosh.

6085
04:22:40,520 --> 04:22:40,960
Nothing?

6086
04:22:41,360 --> 04:22:41,800
Nothing?

6087
04:22:42,400 --> 04:22:42,840
Nothing?

6088
04:22:43,200 --> 04:22:43,640
Nothing?

6089
04:22:44,740 --> 04:22:45,740
What was that sound?

6090
04:22:46,200 --> 04:22:47,080
What are you doing?

6091
04:22:47,100 --> 04:22:48,620
What are you doing coming all the way over here?

6092
04:22:50,920 --> 04:22:51,500
Hold on.

6093
04:22:51,600 --> 04:22:52,300
I think I can...

6094
04:22:52,300 --> 04:22:52,900
Oh.

6095
04:22:57,760 --> 04:22:58,200
Okay.

6096
04:22:59,480 --> 04:22:59,920
Alright.

6097
04:23:02,640 --> 04:23:03,080
Okay.

6098
04:23:03,080 --> 04:23:03,220
Okay.

6099
04:23:03,440 --> 04:23:05,240
They don't do reports in here, I guess.

6100
04:23:05,480 --> 04:23:06,980
It's too noisy and stuff.

6101
04:23:07,460 --> 04:23:07,860
Huh?

6102
04:23:10,800 --> 04:23:11,200
Alright.

6103
04:23:11,700 --> 04:23:13,300
I should probably save.

6104
04:23:15,680 --> 04:23:16,560
I should probably...

6105
04:23:16,560 --> 04:23:17,480
I should probably save.

6106
04:23:17,740 --> 04:23:21,300
Even though I feel like, you know, if we die, we just start back at the door.

6107
04:23:21,400 --> 04:23:21,860
But it's fine.

6108
04:23:22,080 --> 04:23:23,220
I'll save just in case.

6109
04:23:23,300 --> 04:23:23,440
You know?

6110
04:23:24,780 --> 04:23:25,180
IWSFG.

6111
04:23:25,320 --> 04:23:26,080
Welcome to membership.

6112
04:23:26,260 --> 04:23:26,980
Thank you.

6113
04:23:29,460 --> 04:23:30,120
Who are you?

6114
04:23:30,140 --> 04:23:31,020
Late with your status report.

6115
04:23:32,580 --> 04:23:32,980
Guys.

6116
04:23:32,980 --> 04:23:33,060
Guys.

6117
04:23:33,060 --> 04:23:37,500
Actually, I think also, maybe it doesn't come so quickly if there's no...

6118
04:23:37,500 --> 04:23:40,040
Like, most of the time, I feel like I take out these guys.

6119
04:23:42,900 --> 04:23:44,120
It's in front of a camera.

6120
04:23:44,500 --> 04:23:49,820
It means that if you have confidence that what you're doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.

6121
04:23:50,360 --> 04:23:55,800
I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not, but, Snake, believe in yourself.

6122
04:24:01,780 --> 04:24:03,740
I'll try for you, Mei Ling.

6123
04:24:03,980 --> 04:24:04,380
Okay.

6124
04:24:31,670 --> 04:24:32,390
Nothing?

6125
04:24:34,010 --> 04:24:37,550
If I can save him, I'm a genius and I'll make him.

6126
04:24:37,550 --> 04:24:37,850
Nope.

6127
04:24:38,710 --> 04:24:39,110
Okay.

6128
04:24:42,200 --> 04:24:42,280
See you.

6129
04:24:42,580 --> 04:24:42,900
See you.

6130
04:24:43,200 --> 04:24:43,560
Bye-bye.

6131
04:24:43,560 --> 04:24:43,760
Bye...

6132
04:24:44,540 --> 04:24:44,980
Thanks.

6133
04:24:44,980 --> 04:24:45,620
See you.

6134
04:24:45,740 --> 04:24:46,160
Bye!

6135
04:24:46,240 --> 04:24:46,960
Hi.

6136
04:25:04,460 --> 04:25:05,180
Thanks.

6137
04:25:05,240 --> 04:25:05,640
Oh, wait.

6138
04:25:06,260 --> 04:25:06,700
Não.

6139
04:25:06,700 --> 04:25:07,160
He's up here anyway.

6140
04:25:08,120 --> 04:25:09,100
If I can see him.

6141
04:25:10,620 --> 04:25:11,920
Actually, I don't know if I can see him.

6142
04:25:14,840 --> 04:25:15,500
Where is he?

6143
04:25:16,400 --> 04:25:16,880
Missed... oh!

6144
04:25:23,020 --> 04:25:24,140
Is there another guy?

6145
04:25:26,400 --> 04:25:29,320
Am I just hear... or I'm just... I'm hearing something.

6146
04:25:29,500 --> 04:25:30,660
I think maybe I'm just hearing that thing.

6147
04:25:34,840 --> 04:25:35,560
Stun gun.

6148
04:25:37,700 --> 04:25:38,060
Grenade.

6149
04:25:47,710 --> 04:25:49,270
Oh my god!

6150
04:25:49,310 --> 04:25:49,570
No!

6151
04:25:51,350 --> 04:25:52,390
No!

6152
04:25:52,770 --> 04:25:54,530
I... I... I... Oh my god!

6153
04:25:54,650 --> 04:25:54,830
No!

6154
04:25:56,050 --> 04:25:57,090
No!

6155
04:25:58,090 --> 04:25:59,130
No!

6156
04:26:01,530 --> 04:26:03,590
I... I... I...

6157
04:26:13,720 --> 04:26:16,860
Gosh darn it!

6158
04:26:17,740 --> 04:26:18,920
Get his head.

6159
04:26:28,040 --> 04:26:29,220
Oh dang, that was close.

6160
04:26:36,880 --> 04:26:39,020
I want to take out his radio.

6161
04:26:39,900 --> 04:26:40,680
Just in case.

6162
04:26:40,920 --> 04:26:43,460
I don't think it does anything, but you know, just in case.

6163
04:26:48,040 --> 04:26:49,780
I don't want to shoot you in the butt, buddy.

6164
04:26:50,080 --> 04:26:51,040
Yeah, there we go.

6165
04:26:54,280 --> 04:26:55,420
Okay, here we go.

6166
04:26:56,060 --> 04:26:58,060
And here we...

6167
04:26:59,000 --> 04:26:59,420
Don't go.

6168
04:27:00,520 --> 04:27:01,820
What a way to go.

6169
04:27:02,680 --> 04:27:05,060
Shot in the butt by a VTuber.

6170
04:27:06,220 --> 04:27:06,740
Pathetic.

6171
04:27:08,180 --> 04:27:08,940
Absolutely pathetic.

6172
04:27:13,420 --> 04:27:14,580
I could take him out.

6173
04:27:15,680 --> 04:27:17,140
Might actually be easier.

6174
04:27:18,560 --> 04:27:19,080
Hmm...

6175
04:27:20,540 --> 04:27:21,060
Hmm...

6176
04:27:21,060 --> 04:27:21,800
Um, hello?

6177
04:27:21,960 --> 04:27:22,680
Where is this guy?

6178
04:27:24,220 --> 04:27:25,520
Did he sneak past me?

6179
04:27:28,320 --> 04:27:29,180
Where is he?

6180
04:27:29,300 --> 04:27:29,940
Oh, there he is.

6181
04:27:31,720 --> 04:27:32,300
Come on.

6182
04:27:32,560 --> 04:27:33,920
Pss, pss, pss, pss, pss, pss, pss.

6183
04:27:35,120 --> 04:27:35,440
Oh.

6184
04:27:36,460 --> 04:27:37,780
I gave you a little bit more.

6185
04:27:39,360 --> 04:27:39,820
There we go.

6186
04:27:39,920 --> 04:27:40,120
Okay.

6187
04:27:42,060 --> 04:27:42,780
Okay, controller.

6188
04:27:43,580 --> 04:27:44,220
Was this...

6189
04:27:44,220 --> 04:27:45,040
You know what?

6190
04:27:45,060 --> 04:27:46,500
Maybe this part would be easier with the D-pad.

6191
04:27:48,740 --> 04:27:49,880
I'm not so sure, though.

6192
04:27:51,020 --> 04:27:51,540
Actually, no.

6193
04:27:51,660 --> 04:27:52,440
I don't think it will be.

6194
04:27:52,560 --> 04:27:53,360
Okay, here we go.

6195
04:27:54,160 --> 04:27:54,840
Slow and steady.

6196
04:27:57,740 --> 04:27:59,080
My hand is getting sweaty!

6197
04:27:59,080 --> 04:27:59,320
Steady!

6198
04:28:08,450 --> 04:28:10,230
Stinger the crane, get revenge-en.

6199
04:28:12,810 --> 04:28:14,370
Okay, I'm gonna wipe my hands.

6200
04:28:19,710 --> 04:28:20,070
Okay.

6201
04:28:32,220 --> 04:28:32,580
Oopsie.

6202
04:28:33,740 --> 04:28:34,280
There we go.

6203
04:28:47,030 --> 04:28:48,370
I don't think I got his butt.

6204
04:28:49,590 --> 04:28:50,250
Oh, man.

6205
04:28:50,370 --> 04:28:51,350
I didn't get his butt.

6206
04:28:53,290 --> 04:28:54,410
Oh, it's fine then.

6207
04:28:54,670 --> 04:28:54,810
Oh.

6208
04:28:55,690 --> 04:28:56,190
Oh, shoot.

6209
04:28:56,290 --> 04:28:56,590
Oh, shoot.

6210
04:29:07,370 --> 04:29:07,870
There we go.

6211
04:29:07,970 --> 04:29:08,310
Okay.

6212
04:29:08,310 --> 04:29:08,470
Okay.

6213
04:29:08,650 --> 04:29:09,210
Okay,

6214
04:29:13,410 --> 04:29:16,170
it's coming back.

6215
04:29:18,050 --> 04:29:20,690
Oh, I have to be just a little rat.

6216
04:29:21,190 --> 04:29:22,930
No Terminator thumbs up.

6217
04:29:22,990 --> 04:29:23,990
Zero out of ten.

6218
04:29:24,050 --> 04:29:24,590
Bad game.

6219
04:29:26,850 --> 04:29:29,630
Oh, to be just a little rat who can crawl right under.

6220
04:29:32,010 --> 04:29:32,570
Okay.

6221
04:29:33,270 --> 04:29:34,190
Oh, wow.

6222
04:29:34,310 --> 04:29:35,770
The fake-out was real?

6223
04:29:38,230 --> 04:29:38,790
Okay.

6224
04:29:45,750 --> 04:29:47,250
Let's get him so sweaty.

6225
04:29:47,550 --> 04:29:48,250
Okay.

6226
04:29:48,910 --> 04:29:50,090
Okay, okay, okay.

6227
04:29:55,730 --> 04:29:57,650
Oh, I remember!

6228
04:30:02,350 --> 04:30:03,750
Keep going.

6229
04:30:03,950 --> 04:30:05,170
Please, please, please.

6230
04:30:05,450 --> 04:30:06,010
Okay.

6231
04:30:09,850 --> 04:30:10,970
There we go.

6232
04:30:12,670 --> 04:30:13,370
Oh.

6233
04:30:33,660 --> 04:30:36,660
There's some... some things though.

6234
04:30:37,500 --> 04:30:38,820
Yay, you did it.

6235
04:30:38,960 --> 04:30:40,700
Yay, I did it.

6236
04:30:41,000 --> 04:30:42,180
Where'd those... where'd that...

6237
04:30:42,860 --> 04:30:43,820
Where'd that camera go?

6238
04:30:44,000 --> 04:30:44,780
Oh, there's one.

6239
04:30:53,050 --> 04:30:54,810
Well, we just need to go through there.

6240
04:30:55,370 --> 04:30:56,370
So I think we're good.

6241
04:30:56,910 --> 04:30:58,610
Actually, I can't see anything.

6242
04:30:58,750 --> 04:30:59,930
It's so hard to tell where I'm going.

6243
04:31:00,890 --> 04:31:01,370
Oh!

6244
04:31:06,640 --> 04:31:08,380
It's so easy!

6245
04:31:09,760 --> 04:31:11,720
It's so easy!

6246
04:31:12,720 --> 04:31:14,680
It's so easy!

6247
04:31:15,500 --> 04:31:17,400
No way!

6248
04:31:20,280 --> 04:31:22,200
No way!

6249
04:31:30,430 --> 04:31:30,910
Oh.

6250
04:31:33,370 --> 04:31:34,950
What's going... what is that?

6251
04:31:35,090 --> 04:31:35,330
Oh!

6252
04:31:38,900 --> 04:31:40,020
Oh, wait.

6253
04:31:40,020 --> 04:31:40,760
I have the dog tags.

6254
04:31:41,900 --> 04:31:42,320
That's so cool.

6255
04:31:42,900 --> 04:31:44,440
I didn't know they'd be in my inventory.

6256
04:31:44,860 --> 04:31:45,620
Oh, here we go.

6257
04:31:48,520 --> 04:31:49,040
Hmm.

6258
04:31:50,640 --> 04:31:51,160
Hmm.

6259
04:31:53,980 --> 04:31:56,400
Seems a little suspicious to me.

6260
04:31:59,680 --> 04:32:00,520
Oh, dang.

6261
04:32:03,910 --> 04:32:04,770
Oh, what's this?

6262
04:32:06,210 --> 04:32:07,210
Gotta check everything.

6263
04:32:07,350 --> 04:32:07,610
Yes!

6264
04:32:07,710 --> 04:32:08,510
Very good.

6265
04:32:08,750 --> 04:32:09,090
Very good.

6266
04:32:09,910 --> 04:32:10,430
Okay.

6267
04:32:10,950 --> 04:32:11,670
Here we go.

6268
04:32:12,310 --> 04:32:13,210
Beep boop bop.

6269
04:32:13,210 --> 04:32:14,150
Boop beep boop.

6270
04:32:15,150 --> 04:32:16,010
Ready for Raven?

6271
04:32:16,530 --> 04:32:16,950
Yes.

6272
04:32:20,130 --> 04:32:20,550
Yes!

6273
04:32:20,670 --> 04:32:21,490
Oh, yeah.

6274
04:32:21,610 --> 04:32:21,890
Oh, wait.

6275
04:32:21,930 --> 04:32:23,490
We have to fight some more people on here, don't we?

6276
04:32:24,270 --> 04:32:24,950
Oh, no.

6277
04:32:26,790 --> 04:32:29,130
I think this is my favorite updated cutscene really.

6278
04:32:30,290 --> 04:32:30,710
Wow!

6279
04:32:31,710 --> 04:32:32,130
Oh!

6280
04:32:32,130 --> 04:32:32,350
Whoa!

6281
04:32:33,830 --> 04:32:34,250
Oh!

6282
04:32:35,810 --> 04:32:36,230
Oh!

6283
04:32:42,180 --> 04:32:44,200
Why did it explode in the middle?

6284
04:32:44,800 --> 04:32:45,900
Why did it do that?

6285
04:32:48,060 --> 04:32:48,540
Ooh.

6286
04:32:49,880 --> 04:32:50,360
Whoa!

6287
04:32:52,140 --> 04:32:52,960
Oh, my gosh.

6288
04:32:54,540 --> 04:32:55,200
Look up.

6289
04:32:55,340 --> 04:32:56,260
He's doing the pose.

6290
04:32:56,440 --> 04:32:56,900
Oh, not anymore.

6291
04:33:00,440 --> 04:33:01,900
Why did the hat explode?

6292
04:33:07,130 --> 04:33:07,690
Oh, wait.

6293
04:33:07,730 --> 04:33:08,410
I'm fixing my contact.

6294
04:33:10,770 --> 04:33:11,250
Okay.

6295
04:33:11,450 --> 04:33:12,930
Oh, he's right behind me.

6296
04:33:14,790 --> 04:33:16,270
Are they all just running around?

6297
04:33:17,590 --> 04:33:18,070
Ouch!

6298
04:33:18,070 --> 04:33:18,310
Oh!

6299
04:33:18,370 --> 04:33:18,690
Oh!

6300
04:33:19,570 --> 04:33:19,890
Hi!

6301
04:33:21,010 --> 04:33:21,330
Ouch!

6302
04:33:21,330 --> 04:33:21,470
If this...

6303
04:33:21,470 --> 04:33:21,970
I'll just have to get back in the cake.

6304
04:33:22,130 --> 04:33:22,170
Ouch, okay.

6305
04:33:23,470 --> 04:33:24,410
Yeah, I have the body armor.

6306
04:33:30,180 --> 04:33:30,820
I'm reloading.

6307
04:33:31,080 --> 04:33:31,400
Oh.

6308
04:33:36,780 --> 04:33:37,100
Okay.

6309
04:33:40,160 --> 04:33:41,060
No problems here.

6310
04:33:43,340 --> 04:33:44,360
Thank you for the raid.

6311
04:33:45,160 --> 04:33:45,800
Thank you.

6312
04:33:45,880 --> 04:33:47,540
I didn't see who raided, but thank you so much.

6313
04:33:49,980 --> 04:33:50,400
Thank you.

6314
04:33:50,480 --> 04:33:50,580
Thank you.

6315
04:33:52,680 --> 04:33:53,120
Thank you.

6316
04:33:59,060 --> 04:34:00,040
Are you hurt, Snake?

6317
04:34:00,100 --> 04:34:00,600
Hang in there.

6318
04:34:00,660 --> 04:34:01,440
I know you can do it.

6319
04:34:01,500 --> 04:34:02,820
I'm hanging in there too.

6320
04:34:02,900 --> 04:34:03,640
For you, Snake.

6321
04:34:03,960 --> 04:34:05,920
You keep hanging in there, Merrill.

6322
04:34:07,420 --> 04:34:09,320
You're doing amazing.

6323
04:34:10,580 --> 04:34:11,120
Oh my god.

6324
04:34:14,000 --> 04:34:14,360
Hey!

6325
04:34:14,360 --> 04:34:14,900
Delayed much?

6326
04:34:19,210 --> 04:34:19,890
Oh, there it is.

6327
04:34:22,570 --> 04:34:23,470
Yeah, I got it.

6328
04:34:27,520 --> 04:34:29,840
This also has mines in here though, doesn't it?

6329
04:34:30,680 --> 04:34:31,380
Am I just being...

6330
04:34:32,320 --> 04:34:33,680
I'm not being paranoid, am I?

6331
04:34:34,520 --> 04:34:37,060
I could have sworn there's some mines somewhere around here.

6332
04:34:39,760 --> 04:34:40,200
Whoa!

6333
04:34:40,880 --> 04:34:41,320
Whoa!

6334
04:34:41,600 --> 04:34:43,700
Oh, this... now this is the elevator.

6335
04:34:45,240 --> 04:34:45,680
To...

6336
04:34:47,080 --> 04:34:47,520
To...

6337
04:34:52,730 --> 04:34:53,430
To Raven.

6338
04:34:55,950 --> 04:34:58,930
You guys... did I tell you guys that I'm playing through OBS?

6339
04:34:59,910 --> 04:35:01,710
So, it might be a little delayed sometimes.

6340
04:35:02,090 --> 04:35:04,050
But actually, so far, I think it's been pretty good.

6341
04:35:05,550 --> 04:35:06,710
Beep boop, boop boop, boop boop.

6342
04:35:06,810 --> 04:35:07,910
Boop boop, boop boop, boop boop, boop boop.

6343
04:35:07,950 --> 04:35:08,750
The plot elevator.

6344
04:35:08,910 --> 04:35:09,070
Yes!

6345
04:35:09,250 --> 04:35:11,770
This is my... one of my... this is like my favorite part of the game.

6346
04:35:11,870 --> 04:35:12,210
Oh my gosh.

6347
04:35:12,210 --> 04:35:12,770
I'm so excited.

6348
04:35:13,150 --> 04:35:14,810
Have you ever tried Acid 1 and 2?

6349
04:35:15,410 --> 04:35:17,430
I know... I know what kind of games they are.

6350
04:35:17,550 --> 04:35:18,470
But I have not played them.

6351
04:35:18,750 --> 04:35:19,070
Eww!

6352
04:35:26,560 --> 04:35:27,280
Come here, bird.

6353
04:35:28,020 --> 04:35:28,780
Come here, bird.

6354
04:35:29,420 --> 04:35:30,860
Actually, I'm not going to use...

6355
04:35:31,640 --> 04:35:32,340
Oh, just kidding.

6356
04:35:34,040 --> 04:35:36,460
Snake, I've got something to tell you about Naomi Hunter.

6357
04:35:37,240 --> 04:35:37,660
What's that?

6358
04:35:37,660 --> 04:35:37,660
What's that?

6359
04:35:37,940 --> 04:35:38,460
Yeah, what is it?

6360
04:35:42,500 --> 04:35:43,460
What's up?

6361
04:35:44,200 --> 04:35:44,640
What is it?

6362
04:35:44,740 --> 04:35:46,540
I was in the FBI too, you know.

6363
04:35:46,600 --> 04:35:46,980
Oh, really?

6364
04:35:49,180 --> 04:35:49,960
Don't be rude.

6365
04:35:50,160 --> 04:35:51,720
Dr. Hunter's story about her background.

6366
04:35:51,960 --> 04:35:55,940
About her grandfather being an assistant secretary to Hoover in the FBI.

6367
04:35:56,280 --> 04:35:56,720
Uh-huh.

6368
04:35:57,600 --> 04:36:00,160
And then going undercover to investigate the mafia.

6369
04:36:00,440 --> 04:36:00,880
Yeah, yeah.

6370
04:36:01,140 --> 04:36:02,160
Yeah, what about it?

6371
04:36:02,400 --> 04:36:04,940
It was all a big lie.

6372
04:36:04,940 --> 04:36:06,400
What did you say?

6373
04:36:06,720 --> 04:36:08,640
It was really bothering me.

6374
04:36:08,780 --> 04:36:10,820
Why would she lie about it?

6375
04:36:10,920 --> 04:36:11,980
She lied?

6376
04:36:12,360 --> 04:36:13,840
She might be a spy.

6377
04:36:14,160 --> 04:36:14,460
Ridiculous.

6378
04:36:14,460 --> 04:36:14,800
I believed?

6379
04:36:15,100 --> 04:36:15,940
She lied?

6380
04:36:16,020 --> 04:36:18,900
Even a high school student could see past it.

6381
04:36:19,240 --> 04:36:21,800
Didn't Naomi say that her father was Japanese?

6382
04:36:22,180 --> 04:36:22,520
Uh-huh.

6383
04:36:22,800 --> 04:36:27,980
At the time when Edgar Hoover was head of the FBI, there wasn't a single Asian investigator.

6384
04:36:28,580 --> 04:36:33,680
Also, in the 50s, the undercover mafia sting operations hadn't even started yet.

6385
04:36:33,680 --> 04:36:34,100
Oh my god.

6386
04:36:34,940 --> 04:36:38,280
They started in 1960 in Chicago, not New York.

6387
04:36:38,520 --> 04:36:40,060
You better check it out.

6388
04:36:40,220 --> 04:36:43,420
The chief and the president mysteriously died.

6389
04:36:43,560 --> 04:36:44,380
That ninja.

6390
04:36:44,920 --> 04:36:47,440
Too many strange things are happening.

6391
04:36:47,520 --> 04:36:48,700
Her last name being Hunter?

6392
04:36:49,100 --> 04:36:50,520
Are you saying that Naomi might be behind it?

6393
04:36:51,060 --> 04:36:54,840
And Cyborg Ninja being Frank Yeager?

6394
04:36:55,720 --> 04:36:56,880
Could it be?

6395
04:36:57,440 --> 04:36:58,080
Could it be?

6396
04:36:58,080 --> 04:36:59,760
If I find out anything, I'll call.

6397
04:37:00,000 --> 04:37:02,400
In the meantime, be careful.

6398
04:37:03,060 --> 04:37:04,300
Thanks, Master Miller.

6399
04:37:04,940 --> 04:37:05,980
You're the only one who has my back.

6400
04:37:06,880 --> 04:37:08,420
Gosh, Master Miller, you're so cool.

6401
04:37:09,020 --> 04:37:10,840
You're really the only one that has my back.

6402
04:37:36,620 --> 04:37:37,140
He's asleep.

6403
04:37:38,240 --> 04:37:39,580
Wait, what if I get one in the sky?

6404
04:37:51,060 --> 04:37:51,420
Burn!

6405
04:37:51,740 --> 04:37:52,380
I'm sorry!

6406
04:37:58,570 --> 04:37:59,670
Oh, it's getting cold.

6407
04:38:00,410 --> 04:38:01,330
I'm chilly, I'm chilly.

6408
04:38:04,750 --> 04:38:05,970
I'm chilly, I'm chilly, I'm chilly.

6409
04:38:19,220 --> 04:38:19,740
Nice.

6410
04:38:19,840 --> 04:38:20,160
Okay.

6411
04:38:27,090 --> 04:38:27,970
Ah, let's save.

6412
04:38:28,150 --> 04:38:29,290
Oh, let's call people too.

6413
04:38:33,730 --> 04:38:35,030
Colonel, where's Naomi?

6414
04:38:35,490 --> 04:38:35,890
Me out.

6415
04:38:36,530 --> 04:38:38,830
Naomi, I have some questions for you.

6416
04:38:39,310 --> 04:38:40,470
Actually, not you.

6417
04:38:40,550 --> 04:38:41,330
Just kidding.

6418
04:38:41,830 --> 04:38:44,350
Snake, by now those terrorists...

6419
04:38:44,350 --> 04:38:45,570
I have questions for you, Colonel.

6420
04:38:46,050 --> 04:38:47,270
Stop wasting time.

6421
04:38:47,350 --> 04:38:48,030
I'm not wasting time.

6422
04:38:48,030 --> 04:38:49,390
Metal Gear's base is up ahead.

6423
04:38:50,350 --> 04:38:52,170
Snake, it's over 30 below outside.

6424
04:38:53,490 --> 04:38:53,930
Yeah?

6425
04:38:54,130 --> 04:38:54,690
What's wrong?

6426
04:38:54,790 --> 04:38:55,530
I don't want to talk to you.

6427
04:38:55,530 --> 04:38:55,890
Forget it.

6428
04:38:56,030 --> 04:38:56,470
Thanks.

6429
04:39:00,190 --> 04:39:02,790
Stop lollygagging around and get to Metal Gear's base.

6430
04:39:02,950 --> 04:39:03,270
Sorry.

6431
04:39:03,270 --> 04:39:03,890
There's no time.

6432
04:39:04,270 --> 04:39:04,710
Sorry.

6433
04:39:04,790 --> 04:39:05,690
Sorry, Colonel.

6434
04:39:05,870 --> 04:39:06,310
Oh my gosh.

6435
04:39:08,190 --> 04:39:10,010
Master Miller, I'm so worried about her.

6436
04:39:10,110 --> 04:39:11,390
I want to ask you about Naomi.

6437
04:39:11,770 --> 04:39:11,990
Yeah.

6438
04:39:12,170 --> 04:39:13,990
I'm looking into the details now.

6439
04:39:14,470 --> 04:39:16,070
But it doesn't look good.

6440
04:39:16,890 --> 04:39:20,070
I like how her mouth went, even though nothing came out.

6441
04:39:20,750 --> 04:39:23,270
Snake, keep your guard up.

6442
04:39:23,510 --> 04:39:25,750
You're the only one I can trust, Master Miller.

6443
04:39:25,890 --> 04:39:27,090
You're the only one I can trust.

6444
04:39:28,290 --> 04:39:29,150
Oh my gosh.

6445
04:39:29,970 --> 04:39:30,950
Very subtle, Snake.

6446
04:39:30,950 --> 04:39:32,590
What the hell are all these crows doing around here?

6447
04:39:33,230 --> 04:39:33,710
Crows?

6448
04:39:34,090 --> 04:39:34,990
You got me.

6449
04:39:35,430 --> 04:39:37,370
There were crows around from before.

6450
04:39:37,830 --> 04:39:42,850
But for some reason they started to increase in number about the same time that Foxhound came to the base.

6451
04:39:43,470 --> 04:39:44,510
It's really weird.

6452
04:39:46,070 --> 04:39:46,550
What it could mean.

6453
04:39:48,150 --> 04:39:49,010
I don't know.

6454
04:39:49,610 --> 04:39:50,390
I wonder.

6455
04:39:53,850 --> 04:40:02,450
If we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled nuclear weapons, it's going to become easier and easier for terrorists to get their hands on them.

6456
04:40:02,590 --> 04:40:08,530
Sorry, it's just really funny that everyone's talking about Naomi and she's like, we need to get rid of some of this stuff.

6457
04:40:08,590 --> 04:40:13,510
There was some talk about both sides reducing their nuclear stockpiles to a core deterrent force of less than 500 missiles each.

6458
04:40:13,890 --> 04:40:19,990
And declaring that there would be no nuclear counterstrike in the event of the use of conventional or chemical weapons.

6459
04:40:20,270 --> 04:40:21,590
But talks fell through.

6460
04:40:21,930 --> 04:40:27,830
It seems that America is unwilling to relinquish its position as the most powerful country in the world.

6461
04:40:29,010 --> 04:40:30,050
The pride.

6462
04:40:30,590 --> 04:40:31,110
Pride.

6463
04:40:32,710 --> 04:40:33,750
Then the...

6464
04:40:33,750 --> 04:40:35,830
Mei Ling, how's Naomi?

6465
04:40:37,150 --> 04:40:38,230
She's fine, I guess.

6466
04:40:38,410 --> 04:40:38,890
What's up?

6467
04:40:41,290 --> 04:40:43,910
If you want to talk to Naomi, why don't you call her?

6468
04:40:43,910 --> 04:40:45,290
Yeah.

6469
04:40:45,610 --> 04:40:46,910
I guess so.

6470
04:40:47,250 --> 04:40:48,670
Strange guy.

6471
04:40:49,410 --> 04:40:50,630
Strange guy.

6472
04:40:50,950 --> 04:40:52,270
Shy guy, shy boy.

6473
04:40:52,570 --> 04:40:53,370
Strange boy.

6474
04:40:54,530 --> 04:40:55,650
Boys are weird.

6475
04:40:57,570 --> 04:40:58,610
U.S.A.

6476
04:40:58,610 --> 04:40:59,970
U.S.A.

6477
04:40:59,990 --> 04:41:02,870
Good luck, Snake.

6478
04:41:03,410 --> 04:41:04,130
Thanks.

6479
04:41:04,610 --> 04:41:06,790
About to go fight another person.

6480
04:41:07,430 --> 04:41:08,170
Oh wow.

6481
04:41:08,350 --> 04:41:10,290
It's a good thing we walked through there.

6482
04:41:10,290 --> 04:41:11,110
We would've been crushed.

6483
04:41:11,530 --> 04:41:12,470
Like a little ant.

6484
04:41:15,370 --> 04:41:16,030
Okay.

6485
04:41:22,480 --> 04:41:23,800
What's that?

6486
04:41:25,320 --> 04:41:25,980
Oh

6487
04:41:29,180 --> 04:41:30,160
my god, they're eating her.

6488
04:41:30,460 --> 04:41:31,960
Then they're gonna eat me.

6489
04:41:33,060 --> 04:41:34,700
Oh my god.

6490
04:41:43,220 --> 04:41:44,760
Welcome, Cossack.

6491
04:41:46,060 --> 04:41:47,040
What'd you call me?

6492
04:41:58,460 --> 04:42:01,140
This is the end of the road for you.

6493
04:42:01,540 --> 04:42:03,040
Right, my friends?

6494
04:42:03,720 --> 04:42:04,380
Yeah.

6495
04:42:05,040 --> 04:42:07,160
Caw, caw, caw, caw, yeah.

6496
04:42:07,260 --> 04:42:08,340
They're becoming excited.

6497
04:42:08,880 --> 04:42:09,400
Me too.

6498
04:42:12,140 --> 04:42:15,200
Ravens aren't scavengers like most people think.

6499
04:42:16,500 --> 04:42:17,160
Ravens aren't scavengers like most people think.

6500
04:42:17,160 --> 04:42:17,360
Ravens aren't scavengers like most people think.

6501
04:42:17,360 --> 04:42:21,560
They're simply returning to the natural world, that which is no longer needed.

6502
04:42:21,900 --> 04:42:21,920
They're simply returning to the natural world, that which is no longer needed.

6503
04:42:21,920 --> 04:42:25,360
Sometimes, they even attack wounded foxes.

6504
04:42:25,560 --> 04:42:26,840
Well, I'm a snake.

6505
04:42:26,840 --> 04:42:28,220
You were the one in the M1 tank.

6506
04:42:28,880 --> 04:42:31,400
Must've been a tight fit for a big boy like you.

6507
04:42:33,080 --> 04:42:34,080
I love...

6508
04:42:36,240 --> 04:42:38,640
But that is no true battle.

6509
04:42:43,280 --> 04:42:44,200
Isn't he freezing?

6510
04:42:44,340 --> 04:42:45,080
No, he's a big boy.

6511
04:42:48,460 --> 04:42:50,720
I love that line so much.

6512
04:42:50,860 --> 04:42:52,500
The Ravens and I were testing to see what kind of man you were.

6513
04:42:54,160 --> 04:42:56,340
The judgment is decided.

6514
04:42:56,340 --> 04:42:59,660
The Ravens say you are a true warrior.

6515
04:43:03,140 --> 04:43:03,820
What?

6516
04:43:08,770 --> 04:43:09,970
Snake, you're hallucinating.

6517
04:43:10,110 --> 04:43:10,970
Yes, you are.

6518
04:43:12,770 --> 04:43:13,110
Snake?

6519
04:43:13,890 --> 04:43:15,670
I can't move.

6520
04:43:16,590 --> 04:43:17,270
What?

6521
04:43:18,710 --> 04:43:22,070
The Raven has put the mark of death upon you.

6522
04:43:24,490 --> 04:43:28,230
Blood from the East flows within your veins.

6523
04:43:28,230 --> 04:43:29,190
Ah,

6524
04:43:33,010 --> 04:43:37,510
your ancestors, too, were raised on the barren plains of Mongolia.

6525
04:43:38,790 --> 04:43:39,890
Psycho-Mintus.

6526
04:43:40,130 --> 04:43:43,290
Inuit and Japanese are cousins to each other.

6527
04:43:43,430 --> 04:43:46,750
We share many ancestors, you and I.

6528
04:43:48,090 --> 04:43:50,930
There's no crows in my family tree.

6529
04:43:52,530 --> 04:43:53,710
You ready?

6530
04:43:54,110 --> 04:43:56,210
I am not fond of snakes.

6531
04:43:56,250 --> 04:43:58,910
But you are family, so I cannot complain.

6532
04:43:58,910 --> 04:44:01,470
But there will be no holding back.

6533
04:44:01,470 --> 04:44:01,790
Japanese princess.

6534
04:44:02,550 --> 04:44:03,770
Snake's a Japanese princess.

6535
04:44:04,070 --> 04:44:04,370
Wow!

6536
04:44:05,870 --> 04:44:08,570
Reminds me of Nonomi from Blue Archive.

6537
04:44:09,750 --> 04:44:12,990
I need Vulcan Raven Nonomi art together.

6538
04:44:13,490 --> 04:44:13,730
I need Vulcan Raven Nonomi art together.

6539
04:44:13,730 --> 04:44:15,330
You live in Alaska, too.

6540
04:44:15,550 --> 04:44:18,710
You know of the World Eskimo Indian Olympics.

6541
04:44:19,190 --> 04:44:19,390
You know of the World Eskimo Indian Olympics.

6542
04:44:19,390 --> 04:44:20,270
Now we're talking about the Olympics?

6543
04:44:20,710 --> 04:44:24,910
With that strength, you must have been training in the stick pull and four-man carry.

6544
04:44:25,410 --> 04:44:25,630
With that strength, you must have been training in the stick pull and four-man carry.

6545
04:44:26,370 --> 04:44:28,130
Yes, you are right.

6546
04:44:28,270 --> 04:44:28,310
Yes, you are right.

6547
04:44:28,910 --> 04:44:31,010
There is another event that I excelled at.

6548
04:44:31,030 --> 04:44:32,850
But actually, Snake's mom is Japanese.

6549
04:44:33,450 --> 04:44:35,810
It is called the ear pull.

6550
04:44:36,170 --> 04:44:36,670
Wow.

6551
04:44:37,250 --> 04:44:42,830
It's an event where two opponents pull each other's ears while enduring the harsh cold.

6552
04:44:43,090 --> 04:44:43,250
That sounds awful.

6553
04:44:43,250 --> 04:44:44,270
This is the worst thing ever.

6554
04:44:44,410 --> 04:44:46,910
It tests spiritual as well as physical strength.

6555
04:44:47,330 --> 04:44:49,310
You want to pull each other's ears?

6556
04:44:49,490 --> 04:44:51,170
The form is different.

6557
04:44:51,290 --> 04:44:53,090
But the spirit is the same.

6558
04:44:53,650 --> 04:44:54,690
Rejoice, Snake!

6559
04:44:55,090 --> 04:44:57,330
Ours will be a glorious battle.

6560
04:44:58,910 --> 04:45:01,030
I thought of Kotori for Nonomi because of her hair.

6561
04:45:01,130 --> 04:45:02,150
Oh, I see it!

6562
04:45:02,450 --> 04:45:03,690
It's just plain killing.

6563
04:45:03,790 --> 04:45:04,350
I never thought of it.

6564
04:45:04,390 --> 04:45:11,750
Well, we will see if there is iron in your words.

6565
04:45:12,010 --> 04:45:13,750
Yeah, I take supplements every day.

6566
04:45:18,490 --> 04:45:19,970
What is going on?

6567
04:45:20,430 --> 04:45:22,170
Oh, he's got that iron grip.

6568
04:45:22,510 --> 04:45:22,970
Oh!

6569
04:45:24,290 --> 04:45:24,810
What?

6570
04:45:27,430 --> 04:45:27,950
What?

6571
04:45:34,140 --> 04:45:35,140
Oh my god!

6572
04:45:35,900 --> 04:45:36,440
Oh

6573
04:45:40,880 --> 04:45:41,420
my god!

6574
04:45:41,420 --> 04:45:41,860
Stop!

6575
04:45:43,480 --> 04:45:44,020
Stop!

6576
04:45:44,040 --> 04:45:45,520
He did not just blow it up with...

6577
04:45:45,520 --> 04:45:45,920
No.

6578
04:45:49,040 --> 04:45:50,200
Oh my god.

6579
04:45:52,600 --> 04:45:55,160
He just threw a whole container at him.

6580
04:45:55,280 --> 04:45:58,820
And Snake stopped it once again by blowing it up with missiles.

6581
04:46:01,120 --> 04:46:02,000
Oh no, sorry.

6582
04:46:02,100 --> 04:46:02,960
The first time was a grenade.

6583
04:46:03,600 --> 04:46:04,740
Oh my god.

6584
04:46:05,720 --> 04:46:06,940
Oh my god.

6585
04:46:06,980 --> 04:46:08,480
Blast radius doesn't exist.

6586
04:46:08,720 --> 04:46:10,240
Not for Solid Snake!

6587
04:46:13,480 --> 04:46:14,600
Oh my god.

6588
04:46:14,620 --> 04:46:15,400
That thing is huge!

6589
04:46:15,440 --> 04:46:16,400
Snake, how did...

6590
04:46:16,400 --> 04:46:19,700
Oh, but if I do it...

6591
04:46:20,680 --> 04:46:23,120
If I do it, I get blown up, you know?

6592
04:46:25,420 --> 04:46:27,740
But if there is cutscene buff, then it's fine.

6593
04:46:28,060 --> 04:46:28,920
Hey, get out of here, Crow!

6594
04:46:29,300 --> 04:46:30,520
You're gonna get shot at!

6595
04:46:34,000 --> 04:46:34,400
Oh!

6596
04:46:34,520 --> 04:46:35,740
Oh, he's yelling at him!

6597
04:46:36,020 --> 04:46:36,420
Oh!

6598
04:46:36,480 --> 04:46:36,700
Oh!

6599
04:46:36,760 --> 04:46:37,020
Oh!

6600
04:46:37,060 --> 04:46:38,120
He's yelling at Snake!

6601
04:46:39,340 --> 04:46:39,740
Draw!

6602
04:46:41,440 --> 04:46:42,700
What is going on?

6603
04:46:48,210 --> 04:46:48,610
Okay.

6604
04:46:56,590 --> 04:46:57,210
I missed.

6605
04:46:58,470 --> 04:47:00,990
Okay, so there is a way to like kind of cheese this.

6606
04:47:01,150 --> 04:47:01,410
Okay, so there is a way to like kind of cheese this.

6607
04:47:01,410 --> 04:47:03,430
Where you can just shoot him in the back of the head constantly.

6608
04:47:03,770 --> 04:47:03,810
Where you can just shoot him in the back of the head constantly.

6609
04:47:03,810 --> 04:47:05,050
Oh, well I missed my chance.

6610
04:47:06,370 --> 04:47:07,370
Oh, hold on.

6611
04:47:11,220 --> 04:47:13,000
I unquit my gun, so I'm stupid.

6612
04:47:13,340 --> 04:47:14,020
Oh, I missed my chance.

6613
04:47:14,020 --> 04:47:14,020
Oh, hold on.

6614
04:47:14,020 --> 04:47:14,020
I unquit my gun, so I'm stupid.

6615
04:47:27,570 --> 04:47:27,930
Oh, hold on.

6616
04:47:27,930 --> 04:47:27,930
I unquit my gun, so I'm stupid.

6617
04:47:27,930 --> 04:47:28,630
Let's see.

6618
04:47:29,130 --> 04:47:29,770
You know what?

6619
04:47:29,810 --> 04:47:30,390
Maybe I won't.

6620
04:47:30,430 --> 04:47:31,630
Maybe I'll just do it with the Nikita.

6621
04:47:33,090 --> 04:47:33,550
You know what?

6622
04:47:33,550 --> 04:47:33,550
Maybe I won't.

6623
04:47:33,550 --> 04:47:33,550
Maybe I'll just do it with the Nikita.

6624
04:47:33,550 --> 04:47:34,490
Maybe I will just Nikita it.

6625
04:47:40,120 --> 04:47:40,940
Where is he though?

6626
04:47:41,100 --> 04:47:42,140
Oh, I think he is.

6627
04:47:50,970 --> 04:47:51,330
Pew!

6628
04:47:52,090 --> 04:47:52,650
Oh my god.

6629
04:47:52,870 --> 04:47:53,230
Ouch!

6630
04:48:18,650 --> 04:48:19,610
Oh no, no, no.

6631
04:48:19,730 --> 04:48:19,970
Ah!

6632
04:48:22,030 --> 04:48:22,730
You jerk.

6633
04:48:23,310 --> 04:48:24,210
You son of a gun.

6634
04:48:25,250 --> 04:48:26,150
You have a big gun.

6635
04:48:43,840 --> 04:48:44,980
Actually, I don't know where he is.

6636
04:48:46,240 --> 04:48:46,600
Actually...

6637
04:48:47,100 --> 04:48:47,940
Oh, he's over there.

6638
04:48:50,100 --> 04:48:50,460
Somewhere.

6639
04:48:50,460 --> 04:48:51,060
There he is.

6640
04:48:51,300 --> 04:48:51,440
There he is.

6641
04:48:53,660 --> 04:48:54,320
Did that work?

6642
04:48:55,020 --> 04:48:55,580
Oh my god.

6643
04:48:55,700 --> 04:48:56,060
Wait.

6644
04:48:56,180 --> 04:48:56,760
Oh, he's coming.

6645
04:48:57,060 --> 04:48:57,540
Oh my god.

6646
04:49:03,260 --> 04:49:03,620
Wait.

6647
04:49:04,600 --> 04:49:04,960
Oh, he's coming.

6648
04:49:04,960 --> 04:49:05,920
I just used the stinger.

6649
04:49:06,320 --> 04:49:07,280
I guess that's fair.

6650
04:49:07,460 --> 04:49:08,800
But I think you blow it up, right?

6651
04:49:09,220 --> 04:49:09,580
I guess that's fair.

6652
04:49:09,580 --> 04:49:09,580
But I think you blow it up, right?

6653
04:49:11,040 --> 04:49:13,840
Like there is a way to just like literally shoot him like this.

6654
04:49:15,060 --> 04:49:16,340
Oh, he's running.

6655
04:49:17,240 --> 04:49:18,280
He's so fast.

6656
04:49:18,360 --> 04:49:19,260
He's so furious.

6657
04:49:20,120 --> 04:49:21,540
Oh, he's really fast.

6658
04:49:21,780 --> 04:49:22,440
Hey buddy.

6659
04:49:24,900 --> 04:49:25,820
What are you...

6660
04:49:25,820 --> 04:49:26,840
You're wasting your bullets.

6661
04:49:33,610 --> 04:49:34,970
Pull his ear.

6662
04:49:35,390 --> 04:49:36,430
Pull his ear!

6663
04:49:37,790 --> 04:49:38,830
Let's try the...

6664
04:49:38,830 --> 04:49:39,570
We can try the stinger.

6665
04:49:41,750 --> 04:49:43,170
He's breathing heavy.

6666
04:49:44,590 --> 04:49:45,370
Oh my god.

6667
04:49:45,650 --> 04:49:46,050
Wait, there's...

6668
04:49:46,850 --> 04:49:47,510
Oh my god.

6669
04:49:47,550 --> 04:49:47,790
It's...

6670
04:49:49,190 --> 04:49:51,710
It's like focusing in on all the crows too.

6671
04:49:52,470 --> 04:49:53,190
No way.

6672
04:49:53,370 --> 04:49:54,130
That's so funny.

6673
04:49:59,170 --> 04:50:00,270
Let's just stand right here.

6674
04:50:00,670 --> 04:50:01,390
And um...

6675
04:50:01,390 --> 04:50:01,570
Where

6676
04:50:05,430 --> 04:50:05,670
did he go?

6677
04:50:05,850 --> 04:50:06,550
Oh, there he is.

6678
04:50:06,890 --> 04:50:07,350
Uh oh.

6679
04:50:07,370 --> 04:50:07,890
He's gonna see me.

6680
04:50:13,730 --> 04:50:14,710
I'm gonna use this.

6681
04:50:14,790 --> 04:50:16,090
And then I'm gonna switch the body over.

6682
04:50:18,170 --> 04:50:18,750
Oh my god.

6683
04:50:19,630 --> 04:50:21,390
Why are you heavy breathing so much?

6684
04:50:21,510 --> 04:50:21,730
Stop!

6685
04:50:21,730 --> 04:50:22,430
You're scaring me!

6686
04:50:40,520 --> 04:50:42,700
I heard that this fight was so much easier...

6687
04:50:42,700 --> 04:50:42,840
Oh.

6688
04:50:44,600 --> 04:50:45,140
Oh my god.

6689
04:50:45,540 --> 04:50:47,340
It was so much easier in this one.

6690
04:50:47,520 --> 04:50:49,180
And I mean, all the fights pretty much are.

6691
04:50:50,140 --> 04:50:50,500
But...

6692
04:50:51,980 --> 04:50:53,260
I wanna try and do the cheese.

6693
04:50:53,780 --> 04:50:54,140
Wait.

6694
04:50:54,220 --> 04:50:55,080
Oh, maybe I can do it here.

6695
04:50:59,940 --> 04:51:00,560
Oh shoot.

6696
04:51:00,760 --> 04:51:01,060
Ah!

6697
04:51:01,120 --> 04:51:01,420
Ah!

6698
04:51:01,480 --> 04:51:01,900
Hold on!

6699
04:51:02,000 --> 04:51:02,820
Oh my god.

6700
04:51:02,840 --> 04:51:03,020
Please.

6701
04:51:07,180 --> 04:51:08,260
As long as I don't die.

6702
04:51:08,260 --> 04:51:08,880
Oh my god.

6703
04:51:09,700 --> 04:51:10,820
Maybe I have to get him in the head.

6704
04:51:17,030 --> 04:51:17,970
Stop shooting me!

6705
04:51:22,830 --> 04:51:24,050
I take a couple hits.

6706
04:51:24,330 --> 04:51:25,530
You take a couple hits.

6707
04:51:25,970 --> 04:51:27,070
It works out this way.

6708
04:51:31,590 --> 04:51:32,910
I take a couple hits.

6709
04:51:33,270 --> 04:51:34,470
You take a couple hits.

6710
04:51:35,450 --> 04:51:37,350
I'm just a little tankier than him, you guys.

6711
04:51:43,390 --> 04:51:44,770
Body armor for the win.

6712
04:51:44,870 --> 04:51:45,470
For real.

6713
04:51:47,750 --> 04:51:48,630
For real.

6714
04:51:49,970 --> 04:51:51,990
Just as the boss said.

6715
04:51:52,070 --> 04:51:52,250
Just as the boss said.

6716
04:51:52,250 --> 04:51:52,430
Beep beep beep.

6717
04:51:54,310 --> 04:51:58,290
It is my existence which is no longer needed in this world.

6718
04:51:58,290 --> 04:51:58,310
It is my existence which is no longer needed in this world.

6719
04:51:58,310 --> 04:51:59,750
Oh, our body armor is on.

6720
04:52:00,750 --> 04:52:02,970
It's not very sexy.

6721
04:52:03,230 --> 04:52:05,290
But my body will not remain in this place.

6722
04:52:05,790 --> 04:52:06,110
But my body will not remain in this place.

6723
04:52:06,970 --> 04:52:08,650
The blood looks fake.

6724
04:52:08,870 --> 04:52:13,230
My spirit and my flesh will become one with the Ravens.

6725
04:52:13,250 --> 04:52:13,750
My spirit and my flesh will become one with the Ravens.

6726
04:52:14,510 --> 04:52:16,430
Maybe because like in the other...

6727
04:52:16,430 --> 04:52:18,030
With the other people, they were wearing clothes.

6728
04:52:19,870 --> 04:52:21,210
But with this, he's not.

6729
04:52:21,250 --> 04:52:22,650
It's just his skin, so it doesn't like...

6730
04:52:22,650 --> 04:52:23,410
Snake!

6731
04:52:24,030 --> 04:52:26,150
I will be watching you.

6732
04:52:26,830 --> 04:52:27,390
Understand?

6733
04:52:32,370 --> 04:52:34,050
Should have worn a shirt.

6734
04:52:38,350 --> 04:52:40,990
Snake, take this security card.

6735
04:52:41,190 --> 04:52:43,210
It will open that door.

6736
04:52:44,130 --> 04:52:45,510
Oh, it's so funny.

6737
04:52:45,510 --> 04:52:49,370
Honey, take the card to advance in the game.

6738
04:52:51,710 --> 04:52:52,430
Why?

6739
04:52:54,090 --> 04:52:58,430
You are a snake which was not created by nature.

6740
04:52:59,810 --> 04:53:04,090
You and the boss, you are from another world.

6741
04:53:04,230 --> 04:53:07,190
A world that I do not wish to know.

6742
04:53:09,130 --> 04:53:11,770
Go and do battle with him.

6743
04:53:11,890 --> 04:53:14,410
I will be watching from above.

6744
04:53:15,510 --> 04:53:17,930
First, I'll give you a hint.

6745
04:53:18,250 --> 04:53:22,530
The man you saw die before your eyes.

6746
04:53:25,850 --> 04:53:26,230
Yeah?

6747
04:53:26,450 --> 04:53:27,450
Oh, yeah.

6748
04:53:27,610 --> 04:53:28,730
The Diaper Chief.

6749
04:53:28,990 --> 04:53:30,510
That was not the Diaper Chief.

6750
04:53:30,790 --> 04:53:31,190
What?

6751
04:53:32,730 --> 04:53:33,890
Who was it?

6752
04:53:34,270 --> 04:53:36,430
It was Decoy Octopus.

6753
04:53:36,530 --> 04:53:37,050
No!

6754
04:53:38,130 --> 04:53:39,730
Oh, no!

6755
04:53:40,170 --> 04:53:40,930
No!

6756
04:53:41,370 --> 04:53:41,710
No!

6757
04:53:46,070 --> 04:53:49,030
We never got to fight Decoy Octopus!

6758
04:53:50,150 --> 04:53:50,850
No way.

6759
04:53:50,850 --> 04:53:52,450
He was a master of disguise.

6760
04:53:53,150 --> 04:53:54,310
Wait, did we get to see him?

6761
04:53:54,550 --> 04:53:57,110
He copied his subjects down to the blood.

6762
04:53:57,330 --> 04:53:57,850
Stop!

6763
04:53:57,870 --> 04:54:00,870
So he drained the Chief's blood and took it into himself.

6764
04:54:01,110 --> 04:54:02,670
We actually get to see Decoy Octopus?

6765
04:54:02,930 --> 04:54:06,310
But he wasn't able to deceive the Angel of Death.

6766
04:54:06,470 --> 04:54:07,710
I thought he was about to take off his pants.

6767
04:54:08,510 --> 04:54:09,910
The Angel of Death.

6768
04:54:12,950 --> 04:54:13,670
That's awesome.

6769
04:54:13,750 --> 04:54:14,630
We actually get to see him.

6770
04:54:17,330 --> 04:54:17,930
That's me.

6771
04:54:18,030 --> 04:54:18,910
I'm the Angel of Death.

6772
04:54:20,550 --> 04:54:22,370
But why go to so much trouble?

6773
04:54:22,610 --> 04:54:24,110
Why impersonate the Chief?

6774
04:54:28,070 --> 04:54:30,210
That is the end of my hint.

6775
04:54:30,770 --> 04:54:33,470
You must solve the rest of the riddle yourself.

6776
04:54:34,490 --> 04:54:34,970
Yeah.

6777
04:54:35,070 --> 04:54:37,050
What questions was he asking me?

6778
04:54:39,250 --> 04:54:43,910
He was asking a lot of questions to me, you know, when I met him.

6779
04:54:46,470 --> 04:54:47,290
Voldemort, stop.

6780
04:54:49,750 --> 04:54:52,730
How would the fight be with Decoy since he only knows how to disguise himself?

6781
04:54:53,110 --> 04:54:54,550
He could disguise himself as the wall.

6782
04:54:54,690 --> 04:54:55,810
It's like hide and seek, you know?

6783
04:54:55,810 --> 04:54:56,510
You have to go find him.

6784
04:55:10,140 --> 04:55:11,240
They're eating him!

6785
04:55:13,760 --> 04:55:14,460
Oh god.

6786
04:55:14,620 --> 04:55:15,800
Oh, it's really nasty.

6787
04:55:20,380 --> 04:55:21,140
Oh, gross.

6788
04:55:24,420 --> 04:55:29,080
In the natural world, there is no such thing as boundless slaughter.

6789
04:55:32,210 --> 04:55:34,400
There is always an end to it.

6790
04:55:34,440 --> 04:55:36,160
But you are different.

6791
04:55:37,290 --> 04:55:38,660
What are you trying to say?

6792
04:55:39,580 --> 04:55:43,040
The path you walk on has no end.

6793
04:55:43,980 --> 04:55:50,120
No matter how far you go, or how many corpses you crawl over.

6794
04:55:51,060 --> 04:55:53,520
The killing will never end.

6795
04:55:54,020 --> 04:55:56,600
It's a future without hope.

6796
04:55:59,920 --> 04:56:01,440
I hate how...

6797
04:56:02,120 --> 04:56:02,480
Oh.

6798
04:56:03,380 --> 04:56:04,460
Laughing octopus.

6799
04:56:04,920 --> 04:56:07,760
My spirit will be watching you.

6800
04:56:08,040 --> 04:56:08,360
Wow.

6801
04:56:08,620 --> 04:56:10,700
It was... it was like a balloon.

6802
04:56:10,840 --> 04:56:11,520
There's nothing to him.

6803
04:56:13,940 --> 04:56:19,740
It's really, uh, sad how... kind of true that ends up being.

6804
04:56:23,210 --> 04:56:24,410
Poor Snake.

6805
04:56:25,030 --> 04:56:26,990
Snake has had a hard life.

6806
04:56:28,110 --> 04:56:29,550
No bones.

6807
04:56:31,170 --> 04:56:32,010
No bones.

6808
04:56:33,130 --> 04:56:35,410
Yeah, Raven wasn't wrong, unfortunately.

6809
04:56:37,770 --> 04:56:38,830
The music.

6810
04:56:39,530 --> 04:56:40,250
Oh!

6811
04:56:45,230 --> 04:56:45,950
Colonel!

6812
04:56:46,310 --> 04:56:46,370
Colonel!

6813
04:56:46,610 --> 04:56:47,290
Is Naomi there?

6814
04:56:47,650 --> 04:56:49,030
No, she's away.

6815
04:56:49,310 --> 04:56:50,910
She's taking a short nap.

6816
04:56:50,910 --> 04:56:52,790
Oh, I wish I could take a short nap on the job.

6817
04:56:53,030 --> 04:56:54,270
So what is this about Naomi?

6818
04:56:55,390 --> 04:56:55,830
Okay.

6819
04:56:55,830 --> 04:56:57,970
Maybe we'd better let the Colonel hear this, too.

6820
04:56:58,190 --> 04:56:58,550
Mm-hmm.

6821
04:56:58,570 --> 04:56:58,810
Yeah.

6822
04:56:59,130 --> 04:57:00,110
Go on, Master.

6823
04:57:00,430 --> 04:57:06,190
Well, basically, Dr. Naomi Hunter... is not Dr. Naomi Hunter at all.

6824
04:57:06,330 --> 04:57:06,570
What?

6825
04:57:06,770 --> 04:57:06,950
What?

6826
04:57:07,390 --> 04:57:10,610
I thought her story of her background sounded kind of fishy.

6827
04:57:10,810 --> 04:57:11,070
Yeah.

6828
04:57:11,170 --> 04:57:12,410
I believe you.

6829
04:57:12,590 --> 04:57:12,950
So I checked it out.

6830
04:57:12,950 --> 04:57:12,950
And?

6831
04:57:13,530 --> 04:57:15,930
There is an actual Dr. Naomi Hunter.

6832
04:57:16,530 --> 04:57:18,630
Or I should say, there was one.

6833
04:57:18,690 --> 04:57:19,050
Skinwalker.

6834
04:57:19,170 --> 04:57:20,210
She took her body.

6835
04:57:20,210 --> 04:57:21,270
She's not the woman we know.

6836
04:57:21,690 --> 04:57:24,550
The real Naomi Hunter disappeared somewhere in the Middle East.

6837
04:57:24,610 --> 04:57:25,610
She buried her in the sand.

6838
04:57:26,110 --> 04:57:28,630
Now Naomi must have somehow obtained her identification papers.

6839
04:57:28,670 --> 04:57:29,070
Oh, my gosh.

6840
04:57:29,290 --> 04:57:30,550
So then who is she really?

6841
04:57:30,970 --> 04:57:33,530
She must be some kind of spy.

6842
04:57:33,890 --> 04:57:34,330
Spy?

6843
04:57:34,550 --> 04:57:34,970
A spy.

6844
04:57:35,350 --> 04:57:36,070
Among us?

6845
04:57:36,290 --> 04:57:36,430
Yes.

6846
04:57:36,530 --> 04:57:38,990
Maybe she's been sent to sabotage this operation.

6847
04:57:39,370 --> 04:57:41,210
Are you saying she's with the terrorists?

6848
04:57:41,310 --> 04:57:41,570
Oh, my God.

6849
04:57:41,610 --> 04:57:41,950
Oh, my God.

6850
04:57:42,070 --> 04:57:43,310
I don't want to believe it either.

6851
04:57:43,490 --> 04:57:45,470
But she is working for Foxhound.

6852
04:57:45,770 --> 04:57:49,290
So you think she had a part in the uprising?

6853
04:57:50,210 --> 04:57:53,290
Or she could be working with some different group altogether.

6854
04:57:53,770 --> 04:57:53,810
Sand curse.

6855
04:57:53,810 --> 04:57:55,110
How do you know I have a sand curse?

6856
04:57:55,110 --> 04:57:55,670
A different group.

6857
04:57:56,290 --> 04:57:57,270
It couldn't be.

6858
04:57:58,190 --> 04:57:59,830
Place her under arrest, Colonel.

6859
04:58:00,030 --> 04:58:00,330
Yeah.

6860
04:58:00,730 --> 04:58:01,210
What?

6861
04:58:01,250 --> 04:58:02,650
She's betrayed us, Colonel.

6862
04:58:02,770 --> 04:58:03,030
Yeah.

6863
04:58:03,110 --> 04:58:06,530
She needs to be arrested and interrogated to find out who she's with.

6864
04:58:06,610 --> 04:58:06,950
Yeah.

6865
04:58:07,150 --> 04:58:10,910
If she's one of their spies, then we're in big trouble.

6866
04:58:11,050 --> 04:58:12,090
What do you mean?

6867
04:58:12,310 --> 04:58:13,510
What have you told her, Colonel?

6868
04:58:14,210 --> 04:58:14,690
Nothing.

6869
04:58:15,210 --> 04:58:19,570
Colonel, have you let her in on some kind of vital secret or something?

6870
04:58:19,730 --> 04:58:20,190
Nothing.

6871
04:58:20,190 --> 04:58:20,290
Uh-oh.

6872
04:58:22,030 --> 04:58:27,390
Does this have anything to do with the mysterious deaths of the DARPA chief and the arms tech president?

6873
04:58:27,730 --> 04:58:30,130
I have no idea.

6874
04:58:30,550 --> 04:58:33,750
Colonel, that is the least convincing answer I've ever heard in my life.

6875
04:58:34,070 --> 04:58:35,490
We cannot allow her to participate any further in this mission.

6876
04:58:35,710 --> 04:58:36,030
Wait.

6877
04:58:36,430 --> 04:58:37,250
Wait a minute.

6878
04:58:37,730 --> 04:58:40,550
Without her, we can't complete this mission.

6879
04:58:40,730 --> 04:58:41,210
I knew it.

6880
04:58:41,770 --> 04:58:42,770
You're hiding something.

6881
04:58:43,030 --> 04:58:43,750
Thank you.

6882
04:58:43,750 --> 04:58:44,390
Give me some time.

6883
04:58:44,550 --> 04:58:46,290
Have a good rest of your night, Alan.

6884
04:58:46,490 --> 04:58:46,950
Thank you.

6885
04:58:46,950 --> 04:58:47,630
Hurry, then.

6886
04:58:47,890 --> 04:58:51,450
We've got to figure out who she is and what she's doing here.

6887
04:58:51,610 --> 04:58:52,170
I understand.

6888
04:58:53,410 --> 04:58:55,110
Snake, give me some time.

6889
04:58:55,210 --> 04:58:57,410
I don't have any time left for you.

6890
04:58:57,610 --> 04:58:59,150
Yeah, you tell him, Snake.

6891
04:58:59,210 --> 04:59:00,090
You tell him.

6892
04:59:01,050 --> 04:59:01,890
Oh, my gosh.

6893
04:59:01,990 --> 04:59:02,750
Master Miller.

6894
04:59:05,870 --> 04:59:06,730
What's that sound?

6895
04:59:10,190 --> 04:59:11,030
Are you ready?

6896
04:59:16,520 --> 04:59:18,680
I got his dog tags.

6897
04:59:19,000 --> 04:59:19,860
Vulcan Raven.

6898
04:59:21,760 --> 04:59:22,160
Wait.

6899
04:59:22,340 --> 04:59:25,720
Oh, could I have gotten Psycho Mantis' too, I wonder?

6900
04:59:26,300 --> 04:59:26,900
Oh, no.

6901
04:59:26,960 --> 04:59:27,560
That's a shame.

6902
04:59:28,200 --> 04:59:29,720
I didn't get it because I didn't know.

6903
04:59:32,560 --> 04:59:33,680
It's so chilly in here.

6904
04:59:40,450 --> 04:59:42,270
Let's put the body armor back on.

6905
04:59:51,270 --> 04:59:53,330
I don't see anything else, maybe.

6906
04:59:53,690 --> 04:59:54,930
I think maybe we're okay.

6907
04:59:56,570 --> 04:59:59,310
Have you ever listened to all the Snake Kodak calls from Smash Bros.?

6908
04:59:59,830 --> 05:00:01,270
If not, it would be a very fun watch.

6909
05:00:01,410 --> 05:00:02,430
I have seen...

6910
05:00:03,430 --> 05:00:04,950
A good amount of them.

6911
05:00:04,990 --> 05:00:09,750
I don't remember if I watched like a compilation of all of them or if I finished that compilation if I watched one.

6912
05:00:09,870 --> 05:00:12,770
But I have seen some.

6913
05:00:12,910 --> 05:00:13,410
Yes.

6914
05:00:14,870 --> 05:00:16,770
Miller is the only honest guy in this game.

6915
05:00:16,890 --> 05:00:17,370
Truly.

6916
05:00:22,350 --> 05:00:24,190
I remember you.

6917
05:00:27,750 --> 05:00:29,450
I remember you.

6918
05:00:32,470 --> 05:00:32,970
I...

6919
05:00:33,550 --> 05:00:34,950
I remember you.

6920
05:00:34,950 --> 05:00:35,110
You.

6921
05:00:37,910 --> 05:00:38,350
Check...

6922
05:00:38,350 --> 05:00:39,610
Check your rations.

6923
05:00:39,930 --> 05:00:41,810
Yeah, I do need that, don't I?

6924
05:00:43,490 --> 05:00:44,550
Wait a second.

6925
05:00:44,590 --> 05:00:45,970
Is that a person and not...

6926
05:00:48,070 --> 05:00:48,510
Wait.

6927
05:00:48,610 --> 05:00:49,550
Is there a person here?

6928
05:00:49,690 --> 05:00:50,910
I think I saw it turn around.

6929
05:00:52,090 --> 05:00:53,190
This room never...

6930
05:00:53,670 --> 05:00:55,730
I think there's an actual person in here.

6931
05:00:59,760 --> 05:01:00,700
Oh my god, there is.

6932
05:01:00,820 --> 05:01:01,200
Oh my god.

6933
05:01:01,460 --> 05:01:02,340
You scared me.

6934
05:01:05,100 --> 05:01:06,140
You scared me.

6935
05:01:09,220 --> 05:01:10,800
There's a person in here.

6936
05:01:10,900 --> 05:01:11,180
I got it.

6937
05:01:12,800 --> 05:01:13,320
I got it.

6938
05:01:19,270 --> 05:01:19,830
Now, I also know that no one is in here.

6939
05:01:19,830 --> 05:01:20,850
Oh, oh.

6940
05:01:20,930 --> 05:01:21,310
Oh my god.

6941
05:01:21,790 --> 05:01:22,310
Yes.

6942
05:01:22,890 --> 05:01:23,410
Yes.

6943
05:01:24,310 --> 05:01:24,830
Yes.

6944
05:01:24,830 --> 05:01:24,930
Yes.

6945
05:01:25,210 --> 05:01:25,730
Yes.

6946
05:01:25,730 --> 05:01:25,970
Yes.

6947
05:01:26,090 --> 05:01:26,610
Yes.

6948
05:01:27,410 --> 05:01:27,830
Oh my god.

6949
05:01:27,930 --> 05:01:28,230
Ah.

6950
05:01:30,850 --> 05:01:32,210
Where are you going?

6951
05:01:33,010 --> 05:01:33,710
It's him.

6952
05:01:33,710 --> 05:01:33,810
Robin!

6953
05:01:33,810 --> 05:01:34,690
Give me some backup!

6954
05:01:35,090 --> 05:01:35,730
Robin, no!

6955
05:01:37,290 --> 05:01:37,890
Oh my god.

6956
05:01:38,250 --> 05:01:39,010
Oh, shoot.

6957
05:01:41,350 --> 05:01:46,280
I thought the cameras were the only issue here.

6958
05:01:46,700 --> 05:01:48,260
And suddenly they're adding people?

6959
05:01:52,640 --> 05:01:53,260
Oh my god.

6960
05:01:54,060 --> 05:01:54,720
Oh my god.

6961
05:01:54,720 --> 05:01:55,560
I'm also trying to shoot.

6962
05:01:55,780 --> 05:01:56,940
I'm also trying to shoot.

6963
05:01:58,060 --> 05:01:58,500
Please.

6964
05:02:03,560 --> 05:02:04,000
Oh.

6965
05:02:04,540 --> 05:02:04,980
Hi.

6966
05:02:06,700 --> 05:02:07,140
Ouch.

6967
05:02:09,850 --> 05:02:10,670
Oh my god, please.

6968
05:02:10,770 --> 05:02:11,010
Snake.

6969
05:02:11,470 --> 05:02:12,070
There we go.

6970
05:02:12,070 --> 05:02:12,550
Anyway.

6971
05:02:16,120 --> 05:02:17,560
You trapped his call.

6972
05:02:19,440 --> 05:02:21,600
Oh, that's why he ran into there.

6973
05:02:25,490 --> 05:02:26,070
Zoom.

6974
05:02:28,410 --> 05:02:29,770
Wait, where's the zoom?

6975
05:02:30,190 --> 05:02:30,770
Zoom.

6976
05:02:37,890 --> 05:02:38,470
My

6977
05:02:45,500 --> 05:02:46,000
god.

6978
05:02:46,160 --> 05:02:47,240
What a little baby.

6979
05:02:47,520 --> 05:02:48,360
Baby Rex.

6980
05:02:48,700 --> 05:02:49,480
Oh my gosh, you guys.

6981
05:02:49,840 --> 05:02:53,080
Part of my Metal Gear order that I did the other day.

6982
05:02:53,820 --> 05:02:55,100
I got a...

6983
05:02:55,640 --> 05:02:57,580
A Paper Craft Rex.

6984
05:02:59,880 --> 05:03:00,340
Zoom.

6985
05:03:05,880 --> 05:03:06,760
There's no zoom.

6986
05:03:13,860 --> 05:03:14,900
There's no zoom.

6987
05:03:21,640 --> 05:03:22,580
There's no zoom.

6988
05:03:29,210 --> 05:03:30,670
I wanna cry right now.

6989
05:03:34,720 --> 05:03:35,560
What is that?

6990
05:03:36,100 --> 05:03:36,560
Oh.

6991
05:03:36,640 --> 05:03:37,720
I was like, what is that?

6992
05:03:37,820 --> 05:03:39,740
I think I know who that is actually.

6993
05:03:41,880 --> 05:03:43,800
I was like, what is that?

6994
05:03:49,230 --> 05:03:50,130
That's so funny.

6995
05:03:50,430 --> 05:03:52,050
I can see the camera from here, though.

6996
05:03:54,950 --> 05:03:55,350
Zoom.

6997
05:03:56,470 --> 05:03:57,710
I'll just do it myself, then.

6998
05:03:59,430 --> 05:04:00,190
Lame ass.

6999
05:04:00,730 --> 05:04:01,370
Sound track.

7000
05:04:03,630 --> 05:04:06,390
Worst part of the game is the soundtrack, truly.

7001
05:04:08,630 --> 05:04:10,050
Wait, is there someone actually down there?

7002
05:04:11,210 --> 05:04:12,450
Oh no, he's above me.

7003
05:04:12,510 --> 05:04:12,630
Oh.

7004
05:04:12,630 --> 05:04:13,430
Thank you, thank you.

7005
05:04:15,010 --> 05:04:16,530
Zom... thank you for the zom...

7006
05:04:18,410 --> 05:04:18,830
Zombeenies.

7007
05:04:27,910 --> 05:04:28,330
Zom...

7008
05:04:29,210 --> 05:04:30,050
Oh, hello?

7009
05:04:32,010 --> 05:04:32,990
Supplicatory Metal Gear?

7010
05:04:34,010 --> 05:04:35,490
I had no idea you like Metal Gear.

7011
05:04:35,590 --> 05:04:36,330
I love Metal Gear!

7012
05:04:37,130 --> 05:04:38,910
Oh, I got stuff to do.

7013
05:04:38,930 --> 05:04:39,650
I'll catch you on the rerun.

7014
05:04:40,250 --> 05:04:40,930
Love ya!

7015
05:04:41,090 --> 05:04:41,610
Thanks, AP!

7016
05:04:42,230 --> 05:04:43,390
Good luck with your stuff!

7017
05:04:45,150 --> 05:04:47,730
The music in this version seems very subdued.

7018
05:04:47,730 --> 05:04:49,870
Yeah, it is very absent, yeah.

7019
05:04:50,550 --> 05:04:51,570
There's nobody here.

7020
05:04:51,890 --> 05:04:52,810
No guards.

7021
05:04:52,950 --> 05:04:53,530
No mechanics.

7022
05:04:54,390 --> 05:04:55,530
It's too quiet.

7023
05:04:56,150 --> 05:04:57,170
There's some guards.

7024
05:04:57,470 --> 05:04:58,250
There's some guards.

7025
05:04:58,510 --> 05:05:00,290
They said they even input the PAL codes.

7026
05:05:00,430 --> 05:05:01,690
What should I do?

7027
05:05:01,870 --> 05:05:02,390
Oh my god, no.

7028
05:05:02,450 --> 05:05:05,730
All we can do is use the override system that President Baker told you about.

7029
05:05:05,730 --> 05:05:06,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we gotta override, we gotta override.

7030
05:05:06,910 --> 05:05:08,530
But I've only got one of the three keys.

7031
05:05:08,810 --> 05:05:13,270
And besides that, like Ocelot said, there's some trick to using the keys.

7032
05:05:13,530 --> 05:05:14,370
Leave it to me.

7033
05:05:14,430 --> 05:05:16,630
There's also actually an easier way here, too.

7034
05:05:16,670 --> 05:05:16,870
Well?

7035
05:05:17,730 --> 05:05:18,970
I'm in the computer room right now.

7036
05:05:19,210 --> 05:05:21,850
I'm trying to access Baker's private files.

7037
05:05:22,030 --> 05:05:22,210
Okay.

7038
05:05:22,330 --> 05:05:22,850
Baker's files?

7039
05:05:23,310 --> 05:05:24,510
Don't you need a password?

7040
05:05:24,890 --> 05:05:25,450
Of course.

7041
05:05:25,450 --> 05:05:26,090
Don't you need a password?

7042
05:05:26,390 --> 05:05:27,690
But there are ways.

7043
05:05:28,710 --> 05:05:30,270
Are you a hacker?

7044
05:05:30,790 --> 05:05:31,390
Yep.

7045
05:05:31,550 --> 05:05:33,410
That describes me pretty well.

7046
05:05:33,650 --> 05:05:35,410
Are you a hacker?

7047
05:05:35,950 --> 05:05:36,610
I don't know yet.

7048
05:05:36,810 --> 05:05:37,870
I'll give it a try.

7049
05:05:38,470 --> 05:05:39,730
Hacking to the gate.

7050
05:05:40,990 --> 05:05:45,750
Na na na na na na na na na na na na.

7051
05:05:46,610 --> 05:05:48,290
Where are the guards, you said?

7052
05:05:48,470 --> 05:05:53,930
There's guards literally right above me.

7053
05:06:00,370 --> 05:06:01,050
I think.

7054
05:06:01,310 --> 05:06:01,810
Wait.

7055
05:06:02,110 --> 05:06:03,330
Where are they?

7056
05:06:04,930 --> 05:06:05,450
Huh?

7057
05:06:09,460 --> 05:06:10,700
Actually, where is the guard?

7058
05:06:14,300 --> 05:06:16,340
I heard someone walking, though.

7059
05:06:16,600 --> 05:06:17,480
Are they one above?

7060
05:06:20,180 --> 05:06:20,700
Oh.

7061
05:06:20,720 --> 05:06:21,100
Uh-oh.

7062
05:06:21,100 --> 05:06:22,160
Is there somebody there?

7063
05:06:22,360 --> 05:06:22,640
Oh.

7064
05:06:22,800 --> 05:06:23,200
Oh.

7065
05:06:23,300 --> 05:06:23,740
Ah!

7066
05:06:24,140 --> 05:06:24,460
Ah!

7067
05:06:25,740 --> 05:06:26,760
Oh, my God.

7068
05:06:27,580 --> 05:06:28,440
Oh, gosh.

7069
05:06:28,640 --> 05:06:30,360
I didn't see your stupid ass.

7070
05:06:31,840 --> 05:06:32,700
Oh, my God.

7071
05:06:56,580 --> 05:06:57,860
Snake, it's me again.

7072
05:06:58,020 --> 05:06:58,840
No guards at all.

7073
05:06:58,880 --> 05:06:59,120
Yeah.

7074
05:06:59,200 --> 05:06:59,740
It's so weird.

7075
05:06:59,860 --> 05:07:01,340
There was never guards in this part before.

7076
05:07:02,080 --> 05:07:04,480
I just got past his third security level.

7077
05:07:04,820 --> 05:07:06,340
He was a pretty careful guy.

7078
05:07:06,660 --> 05:07:08,400
Do you think you'll break in soon?

7079
05:07:08,960 --> 05:07:10,920
I've never met a system I couldn't bust into.

7080
05:07:10,920 --> 05:07:11,840
I couldn't even see where he was going.

7081
05:07:11,860 --> 05:07:12,340
Where is he coming from?

7082
05:07:13,060 --> 05:07:13,540
Man.

7083
05:07:14,660 --> 05:07:15,580
Man, this...

7084
05:07:15,580 --> 05:07:15,680
Oh.

7085
05:07:15,760 --> 05:07:15,880
Uh.

7086
05:07:17,200 --> 05:07:17,680
Uh.

7087
05:07:17,980 --> 05:07:18,460
Uh.

7088
05:07:19,600 --> 05:07:20,080
Uh.

7089
05:07:20,080 --> 05:07:21,280
We're both loading at the same time.

7090
05:07:21,420 --> 05:07:22,320
But I'm faster.

7091
05:07:22,740 --> 05:07:23,400
Oh, my God.

7092
05:07:23,500 --> 05:07:23,940
No.

7093
05:07:24,760 --> 05:07:25,500
No, he's not.

7094
05:07:31,780 --> 05:07:33,000
Where's your stupid shield?

7095
05:07:33,640 --> 05:07:34,540
Where's my shield?

7096
05:07:34,680 --> 05:07:35,100
Oh, my God.

7097
05:07:37,380 --> 05:07:37,860
Okay.

7098
05:07:38,000 --> 05:07:41,460
Now, I can run and hide.

7099
05:07:43,440 --> 05:07:44,420
Where's my box?

7100
05:07:44,980 --> 05:07:45,700
Snow box.

7101
05:07:45,860 --> 05:07:46,280
Snow box.

7102
05:07:50,040 --> 05:07:51,560
I saw people running up.

7103
05:07:51,640 --> 05:07:53,040
But they're gonna see me, aren't they?

7104
05:07:53,060 --> 05:07:53,900
Aren't they gonna see me?

7105
05:08:00,690 --> 05:08:01,830
They're gonna see me, aren't they?

7106
05:08:02,950 --> 05:08:03,650
They're gonna see me.

7107
05:08:05,410 --> 05:08:06,350
Do you think I can walk?

7108
05:08:08,850 --> 05:08:09,210
Okay.

7109
05:08:09,650 --> 05:08:10,010
Oh.

7110
05:08:10,370 --> 05:08:10,730
Oh.

7111
05:08:10,850 --> 05:08:11,790
It was a dead end.

7112
05:08:11,870 --> 05:08:12,410
I could've just...

7113
05:08:12,410 --> 05:08:13,470
I should've just stayed here.

7114
05:08:14,850 --> 05:08:15,210
Okay.

7115
05:08:18,210 --> 05:08:19,890
We'll just wait until the caution's over.

7116
05:08:27,680 --> 05:08:28,620
Can I see them in this room?

7117
05:08:30,960 --> 05:08:31,920
I don't see them.

7118
05:08:33,040 --> 05:08:36,120
They're just like... probably being like, What's going on down there?

7119
05:08:37,320 --> 05:08:38,120
Nothing much.

7120
05:08:38,380 --> 05:08:39,380
Don't worry about it.

7121
05:08:41,080 --> 05:08:42,720
Why would you need to worry about it?

7122
05:08:43,680 --> 05:08:44,320
You know?

7123
05:08:47,660 --> 05:08:48,640
Middle of a hallway.

7124
05:08:49,580 --> 05:08:51,280
I didn't know where this lead to.

7125
05:08:54,280 --> 05:08:54,720
Yeah.

7126
05:08:56,040 --> 05:08:56,680
Oh, my God.

7127
05:08:57,360 --> 05:08:58,240
Oh, my God.

7128
05:08:58,320 --> 05:08:58,600
Oh, my God.

7129
05:08:58,600 --> 05:08:59,080
Oh, wait, hold on.

7130
05:08:59,500 --> 05:09:00,940
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

7131
05:09:11,370 --> 05:09:12,850
Oh my god, what?!

7132
05:09:12,850 --> 05:09:13,770
I tried to...

7133
05:09:21,540 --> 05:09:21,980
What?!

7134
05:09:21,980 --> 05:09:23,100
No, I shot your thing!

7135
05:09:23,360 --> 05:09:24,160
I shot your thing!

7136
05:09:34,870 --> 05:09:35,830
This is so unfair.

7137
05:09:37,210 --> 05:09:38,070
It's so unfair.

7138
05:09:38,650 --> 05:09:39,470
It's so unfair.

7139
05:09:40,250 --> 05:09:41,230
This is so unfair.

7140
05:09:42,030 --> 05:09:43,530
I shot the radio!

7141
05:09:49,790 --> 05:09:51,230
No sign of the AWOL man.

7142
05:09:52,350 --> 05:09:53,490
No, no, please.

7143
05:09:54,190 --> 05:09:55,390
No, god, no!

7144
05:10:05,010 --> 05:10:07,190
I shot... I shot your radio.

7145
05:10:07,470 --> 05:10:08,610
I shot your radio.

7146
05:10:09,090 --> 05:10:10,790
Wait, where's my body armor?

7147
05:10:10,910 --> 05:10:11,330
Oh, there it is.

7148
05:10:11,430 --> 05:10:13,130
I always pass it, like a bajillion times.

7149
05:10:13,570 --> 05:10:15,710
I can't believe I got scammed, for real.

7150
05:10:18,450 --> 05:10:19,330
Oh, thanks!

7151
05:10:24,840 --> 05:10:26,620
How am I supposed to get out of this, though?

7152
05:10:28,480 --> 05:10:30,340
How am I supposed... They're just gonna all keep coming.

7153
05:10:30,440 --> 05:10:32,120
They're all just gonna keep running up here and over here.

7154
05:10:35,540 --> 05:10:35,900
Doshio.

7155
05:10:37,100 --> 05:10:37,460
Gonna

7156
05:10:40,750 --> 05:10:41,510
run out of rations.

7157
05:10:42,250 --> 05:10:43,330
I feel like...

7158
05:10:44,910 --> 05:10:45,890
I should just...

7159
05:11:01,700 --> 05:11:04,460
Just gonna have to blast on my way...

7160
05:11:05,440 --> 05:11:06,720
Blast my way through them, I think.

7161
05:11:18,040 --> 05:11:21,400
My grip is not good enough, I think, for hanging over the railing.

7162
05:11:22,100 --> 05:11:24,400
I think my grip is too... too small.

7163
05:11:28,620 --> 05:11:29,260
That's okay.

7164
05:11:32,440 --> 05:11:32,920
But...

7165
05:11:36,840 --> 05:11:37,360
What's that?

7166
05:11:37,360 --> 05:11:38,020
Just as I thought.

7167
05:11:38,160 --> 05:11:42,540
The nuclear warhead is designed to be fired from the railgun like a projectile.

7168
05:11:42,780 --> 05:11:46,240
It doesn't use fuel, so it isn't considered a missile.

7169
05:11:46,400 --> 05:11:49,300
That way it can get around all sorts of international treaties.

7170
05:11:49,420 --> 05:11:49,760
Oh my god.

7171
05:11:50,060 --> 05:11:50,700
Pretty sneaky.

7172
05:11:51,380 --> 05:11:51,940
Sneaky.

7173
05:11:52,300 --> 05:11:52,780
Yes, but effective.

7174
05:11:53,120 --> 05:11:56,020
And that's not even the scariest thing about this weapon.

7175
05:11:56,400 --> 05:11:58,000
I can't wait to hear this.

7176
05:11:58,680 --> 05:12:00,340
It's a stealth weapon.

7177
05:12:00,660 --> 05:12:01,900
So scary.

7178
05:12:02,440 --> 05:12:03,400
It won't show up on radar.

7179
05:12:03,920 --> 05:12:04,480
Yeah.

7180
05:12:05,080 --> 05:12:06,460
The truth is...

7181
05:12:06,460 --> 05:12:09,740
They've been working on a stealth missile since the late 70s.

7182
05:12:09,820 --> 05:12:12,460
Why weren't they able to develop one up until now?

7183
05:12:12,820 --> 05:12:15,400
Because of the missile's rocket propulsion system.

7184
05:12:15,640 --> 05:12:17,720
It would be picked up by enemy satellites.

7185
05:12:18,220 --> 05:12:19,060
Because of that?

7186
05:12:19,700 --> 05:12:23,380
But unlike a missile, the railgun doesn't burn any propellant.

7187
05:12:23,480 --> 05:12:27,320
So it can't be detected by any current ballistic missile detection systems.

7188
05:12:27,420 --> 05:12:27,980
Insanity.

7189
05:12:27,980 --> 05:12:29,820
An invisible nuclear warhead.

7190
05:12:29,840 --> 05:12:30,620
So scary.

7191
05:12:30,800 --> 05:12:32,480
Totally impossible to intercept.

7192
05:12:32,660 --> 05:12:33,300
Oh my god.

7193
05:12:33,580 --> 05:12:36,440
And on top of that, it's got a surface-piercing weapon.

7194
05:12:36,440 --> 05:12:39,420
A warhead designed to penetrate hardened underground bases.

7195
05:12:39,840 --> 05:12:41,340
We learned that less than the Gulf War.

7196
05:12:41,680 --> 05:12:44,400
This thing could mean the end of the world.

7197
05:12:44,680 --> 05:12:46,220
It's the ultimate weapon.

7198
05:12:46,500 --> 05:12:52,120
And from a political point of view, it avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections.

7199
05:12:52,860 --> 05:12:54,540
Colonel, is this true?

7200
05:12:54,780 --> 05:12:55,780
Are you listening?

7201
05:12:56,380 --> 05:12:56,960
I'm listening.

7202
05:12:57,220 --> 05:13:00,320
It would push back the signing of the START III treaty.

7203
05:13:00,640 --> 05:13:04,860
If word gets out about this weapon, it'd cause a whole world of trouble.

7204
05:13:04,980 --> 05:13:05,360
Oh yeah.

7205
05:13:05,500 --> 05:13:05,780
Yeah.

7206
05:13:06,440 --> 05:13:07,100
It would be nasty.

7207
05:13:07,540 --> 05:13:10,080
The United States would be denounced by the UN.

7208
05:13:10,460 --> 05:13:12,520
It could even bring the President down.

7209
05:13:12,740 --> 05:13:13,080
Oh my god.

7210
05:13:13,220 --> 05:13:14,220
Did you know this, Colonel?

7211
05:13:14,520 --> 05:13:15,140
Not the President.

7212
05:13:15,200 --> 05:13:15,680
I'm sorry.

7213
05:13:16,360 --> 05:13:17,760
You've changed, Colonel.

7214
05:13:18,100 --> 05:13:19,480
God, I'm so disappointed.

7215
05:13:19,540 --> 05:13:19,800
I won't make any excuses.

7216
05:13:20,020 --> 05:13:21,340
I'm disappointed in you, Colonel.

7217
05:13:21,680 --> 05:13:22,340
Listen to me.

7218
05:13:22,760 --> 05:13:26,860
This new nuclear weapon, it's never actually been tested.

7219
05:13:27,100 --> 05:13:28,320
Only simulated.

7220
05:13:28,860 --> 05:13:30,220
You mean with VR experiments?

7221
05:13:30,760 --> 05:13:31,220
Yeah.

7222
05:13:31,500 --> 05:13:33,400
That's why they were conducting this exercise.

7223
05:13:33,400 --> 05:13:34,380
Man, they love VR.

7224
05:13:34,380 --> 05:13:37,940
They needed to get actual experimental data to back up the simulation.

7225
05:13:37,960 --> 05:13:38,920
VR is the future.

7226
05:13:39,200 --> 05:13:40,280
What were the results of the exercise?

7227
05:13:40,860 --> 05:13:42,960
It looks like it went better than they hoped for.

7228
05:13:43,200 --> 05:13:46,800
But I can't find the data anywhere on this network.

7229
05:13:47,300 --> 05:13:50,480
You'd think the data as important as that would be carefully recorded.

7230
05:13:50,480 --> 05:13:51,400
Cal built the mech?

7231
05:13:51,440 --> 05:13:51,560
It was.

7232
05:13:51,740 --> 05:13:52,580
Didn't build the railgun?

7233
05:13:52,740 --> 05:13:53,440
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

7234
05:13:53,440 --> 05:13:55,400
The President gave me an optical disc with all of the test data.

7235
05:13:55,680 --> 05:13:56,080
What?

7236
05:13:56,460 --> 05:13:57,600
Do you still have it?

7237
05:13:57,720 --> 05:13:58,120
No.

7238
05:13:58,780 --> 05:14:00,080
Ocelot took it from me.

7239
05:14:00,460 --> 05:14:00,900
Damn.

7240
05:14:01,140 --> 05:14:01,580
Damn.

7241
05:14:01,800 --> 05:14:04,360
The terrorists have replaced the dummy warhead with a weapon.

7242
05:14:04,380 --> 05:14:05,240
A real warhead.

7243
05:14:05,380 --> 05:14:05,920
Oh my god.

7244
05:14:06,020 --> 05:14:09,380
Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready to launch.

7245
05:14:09,680 --> 05:14:11,440
So, you think they can do it?

7246
05:14:11,680 --> 05:14:16,020
Well, the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the real thing.

7247
05:14:16,140 --> 05:14:17,900
So, I think so.

7248
05:14:18,160 --> 05:14:20,480
Did you find out how to override it yet?

7249
05:14:20,860 --> 05:14:21,600
Not yet.

7250
05:14:21,780 --> 05:14:23,420
It must be in a separate file.

7251
05:14:23,860 --> 05:14:26,900
Right now, I'm looking through all of Baker's personal files.

7252
05:14:27,380 --> 05:14:28,740
We're counting on you.

7253
05:14:29,080 --> 05:14:29,960
We're count...

7254
05:14:29,960 --> 05:14:30,400
Oh, shoot.

7255
05:14:30,540 --> 05:14:31,060
Uh, shoot.

7256
05:14:31,160 --> 05:14:31,540
For real.

7257
05:14:34,380 --> 05:14:35,000
Oh, hello?

7258
05:14:35,160 --> 05:14:35,780
Oh, it's empty!

7259
05:14:36,280 --> 05:14:37,160
Oh, no.

7260
05:14:43,540 --> 05:14:44,020
Anyway.

7261
05:14:44,760 --> 05:14:45,240
Uh...

7262
05:14:56,100 --> 05:14:56,580
Snake.

7263
05:14:57,160 --> 05:14:57,640
Yeah?

7264
05:14:57,640 --> 05:14:58,260
Did you find it?

7265
05:14:58,340 --> 05:14:58,720
No.

7266
05:14:58,720 --> 05:14:59,000
That was fast.

7267
05:14:59,100 --> 05:14:59,240
Oh.

7268
05:14:59,240 --> 05:15:01,280
I haven't found out about the override system yet.

7269
05:15:01,400 --> 05:15:03,960
But I found Baker's ulterior motive.

7270
05:15:04,320 --> 05:15:06,100
He's just looking to get rich, isn't he?

7271
05:15:06,480 --> 05:15:07,500
That's part of it.

7272
05:15:07,740 --> 05:15:10,780
Arms tech is in much worse financial trouble than I thought.

7273
05:15:11,280 --> 05:15:14,600
I know they lost their bid to make the next generation fighter jet.

7274
05:15:14,880 --> 05:15:17,180
That, plus the reduction in SDI spending.

7275
05:15:17,580 --> 05:15:18,620
It looks like they were working on it.

7276
05:15:18,620 --> 05:15:20,840
There was even some talk of a hostile takeover.

7277
05:15:21,000 --> 05:15:21,040
Oh.

7278
05:15:21,420 --> 05:15:23,860
Everything was riding on this project, I guess.

7279
05:15:24,140 --> 05:15:27,880
And it looks like they were paying a lot of bribe money to the DARPA chief.

7280
05:15:27,980 --> 05:15:28,460
That guy.

7281
05:15:28,780 --> 05:15:29,320
Bride money, huh?

7282
05:15:29,520 --> 05:15:29,960
Yeah.

7283
05:15:30,060 --> 05:15:30,820
He's the worst.

7284
05:15:30,820 --> 05:15:33,620
And Baker was a big proponent of the nuclear deterrent theory.

7285
05:15:33,620 --> 05:15:34,720
The DARPA chief is the worst!

7286
05:15:35,600 --> 05:15:37,800
So anyway, what about the override?

7287
05:15:38,240 --> 05:15:39,760
Just give me a little bit longer.

7288
05:15:40,500 --> 05:15:40,940
Oogie.

7289
05:15:47,180 --> 05:15:47,960
Are there people?

7290
05:15:48,060 --> 05:15:48,520
Oh, shoot.

7291
05:15:48,580 --> 05:15:48,900
Okay.

7292
05:15:48,980 --> 05:15:49,200
Ah!

7293
05:15:49,280 --> 05:15:49,820
Time to go!

7294
05:15:50,180 --> 05:15:50,800
Cuss in!

7295
05:15:51,040 --> 05:15:51,700
Oh, no!

7296
05:15:52,460 --> 05:15:53,320
Cutscene time!

7297
05:16:01,950 --> 05:16:02,570
Oh!

7298
05:16:02,590 --> 05:16:02,930
Oh!

7299
05:16:03,030 --> 05:16:03,450
Oh!

7300
05:16:04,450 --> 05:16:05,070
Yes!

7301
05:16:05,550 --> 05:16:06,070
Go, Snake!

7302
05:16:06,410 --> 05:16:09,330
I've entered the PAL codes and disengaged the safety device.

7303
05:16:10,330 --> 05:16:12,250
We can launch any time.

7304
05:16:13,310 --> 05:16:15,690
There's still no response from Washington.

7305
05:16:16,070 --> 05:16:19,770
It looks like we'll have to show them that we mean business.

7306
05:16:20,130 --> 05:16:20,450
Yeah.

7307
05:16:21,490 --> 05:16:22,110
Oh.

7308
05:16:23,070 --> 05:16:23,690
Dummy.

7309
05:16:23,830 --> 05:16:24,890
Should I set it for 10 seconds?

7310
05:16:26,510 --> 05:16:27,110
Oh.

7311
05:16:27,550 --> 05:16:28,150
No.

7312
05:16:28,150 --> 05:16:29,410
There's been a change.

7313
05:16:29,930 --> 05:16:30,150
Oh?

7314
05:16:30,250 --> 05:16:33,050
The new target is Lopnor, China.

7315
05:16:34,530 --> 05:16:35,550
Why, boss?

7316
05:16:35,970 --> 05:16:37,050
Why, boss?

7317
05:16:38,650 --> 05:16:39,250
Oh!

7318
05:16:39,870 --> 05:16:41,110
Oh, he's so beautiful.

7319
05:16:41,370 --> 05:16:41,590
Oh!

7320
05:16:41,970 --> 05:16:43,050
Liquid... liquid.

7321
05:16:43,350 --> 05:16:49,430
I'm sure neither you nor Mr. Golukhovich would really like to see a nuclear bomb dropped on your motherland, right?

7322
05:16:49,570 --> 05:16:50,390
Mr. Golukhovich.

7323
05:16:50,390 --> 05:16:50,710
... but why?

7324
05:16:50,970 --> 05:16:52,270
There's nothing there.

7325
05:16:52,670 --> 05:16:53,270
Wrong.

7326
05:16:54,070 --> 05:16:54,890
It's a nuclear bomb.

7327
05:16:56,670 --> 05:16:58,890
A nuclear test site.

7328
05:16:59,250 --> 05:17:03,790
If we nuke a major population center, the game's over.

7329
05:17:04,610 --> 05:17:11,130
But a nuclear explosion at a test site can still be concealed from the public.

7330
05:17:11,530 --> 05:17:16,250
Meanwhile, Washington will be worried about the retaliatory strike from China.

7331
05:17:16,790 --> 05:17:21,130
That'll probably mean top-secret talks between both countries' leaders.

7332
05:17:21,130 --> 05:17:22,370
Top secret.

7333
05:17:23,030 --> 05:17:23,350
Of course.

7334
05:17:24,110 --> 05:17:32,450
And in the process, the president will be forced to divulge the existence of a new and highly destabilizing nuclear weapon to the Chinese.

7335
05:17:33,010 --> 05:17:36,110
What do you think that will do to the U.S.'s reputation?

7336
05:17:36,710 --> 05:17:38,790
Or the president's?

7337
05:17:38,810 --> 05:17:39,190
Oh my god.

7338
05:17:39,670 --> 05:17:43,790
And with the CTBT, that means that China and India...

7339
05:17:45,090 --> 05:17:46,750
I think you missed a letter there.

7340
05:17:47,290 --> 05:17:47,850
Wait.

7341
05:17:49,090 --> 05:17:49,750
Ocelot, what?

7342
05:17:49,850 --> 05:17:50,330
The C...

7343
05:17:51,130 --> 05:17:51,170
Yes.

7344
05:17:51,170 --> 05:17:55,890
When the other countries hear about the new weapon, they'll all want to contact us.

7345
05:17:56,370 --> 05:18:01,650
Washington won't be very happy when we start selling their own system to the highest bidders.

7346
05:18:04,010 --> 05:18:04,670
Yes.

7347
05:18:04,950 --> 05:18:07,230
The president will break.

7348
05:18:07,590 --> 05:18:09,810
He will give in to our demands.

7349
05:18:11,110 --> 05:18:14,710
Big Boss's DNA and one billion dollars.

7350
05:18:14,730 --> 05:18:16,750
One billion dollars!

7351
05:18:17,610 --> 05:18:18,230
All for money?

7352
05:18:18,450 --> 05:18:19,070
No.

7353
05:18:19,070 --> 05:18:22,830
That money will be used to cure our genome soldiers as well.

7354
05:18:23,050 --> 05:18:23,830
Ocelot doesn't care about the money?

7355
05:18:24,010 --> 05:18:27,030
I'm also including the fox dye vaccine in our demands.

7356
05:18:28,110 --> 05:18:29,070
Fox dye.

7357
05:18:29,390 --> 05:18:31,910
It killed Octopus and the arms tech president.

7358
05:18:32,010 --> 05:18:32,650
Fox... dye.

7359
05:18:32,650 --> 05:18:34,870
So it's true that it affects older people first.

7360
05:18:36,110 --> 05:18:39,410
Mantis might not have been affected because he wore a mask.

7361
05:18:41,210 --> 05:18:42,830
Wolf wasn't infected either.

7362
05:18:43,110 --> 05:18:46,330
Perhaps due to those tranquilizers she always took.

7363
05:18:46,330 --> 05:18:47,470
Hmm...

7364
05:18:47,470 --> 05:18:51,610
Something to do with amphetamine and adrenaline levels in the blood.

7365
05:18:51,830 --> 05:18:55,250
They deployed a product still in development into live combat.

7366
05:18:55,690 --> 05:18:58,050
No surprise it was unreliable.

7367
05:18:58,250 --> 05:18:58,870
Ridiculous.

7368
05:18:59,010 --> 05:19:00,150
They must have been desperate.

7369
05:19:01,170 --> 05:19:01,790
Desperate.

7370
05:19:03,490 --> 05:19:09,470
In any case, have you heard from your friend Colonel Sergei Golukovich at Spetsnaz yet?

7371
05:19:11,210 --> 05:19:13,230
He still has doubts about the ability of Metal Gear.

7372
05:19:13,230 --> 05:19:17,090
It's so funny when they're just like, By the way, this person's full name and where they're at.

7373
05:19:18,210 --> 05:19:19,110
Do you...

7374
05:19:19,110 --> 05:19:20,270
Do you...

7375
05:19:20,270 --> 05:19:22,130
You know, I gotta give you some context.

7376
05:19:22,350 --> 05:19:22,890
He's a very prudent man.

7377
05:19:24,310 --> 05:19:25,970
There's nothing to worry about.

7378
05:19:26,270 --> 05:19:29,690
The Colonel wants Metal Gear and the new nuclear weapon so bad he can taste it.

7379
05:19:29,690 --> 05:19:31,330
Will the Pazaza Beam save me from Fox dye?

7380
05:19:31,470 --> 05:19:31,850
Oh, maybe.

7381
05:19:31,870 --> 05:19:34,850
Russia wants to regain its position as a military superpower.

7382
05:19:35,370 --> 05:19:38,070
They need to reinforce their nuclear arsenal.

7383
05:19:38,630 --> 05:19:41,370
They need a nuclear weapon that can't be intercepted.

7384
05:19:41,970 --> 05:19:42,210
Wow.

7385
05:19:42,430 --> 05:19:44,350
Metal Gear will allow them to gain power.

7386
05:19:44,370 --> 05:19:47,530
And first strike capability over the rest of the world.

7387
05:19:48,230 --> 05:19:49,130
Oh my god.

7388
05:19:49,130 --> 05:19:51,250
Their regular army is in shambles.

7389
05:19:51,250 --> 05:19:52,450
In shambles.

7390
05:19:52,450 --> 05:19:56,270
And they think they can restore their country's military power with nuclear weapons?

7391
05:19:58,120 --> 05:20:00,410
That Golukovich, he's no warrior.

7392
05:20:00,610 --> 05:20:02,290
He's a politician.

7393
05:20:03,610 --> 05:20:04,510
Maybe so.

7394
05:20:04,570 --> 05:20:05,690
He's a politician.

7395
05:20:05,910 --> 05:20:09,170
He's the one who gave us the Hind and most of our other heavy firepower.

7396
05:20:09,630 --> 05:20:10,190
Dang it, Golukovich.

7397
05:20:10,190 --> 05:20:12,850
He's got over a thousand soldiers under his command.

7398
05:20:12,870 --> 05:20:13,270
Wait, what just happened?

7399
05:20:14,370 --> 05:20:15,010
He joined forces.

7400
05:20:15,310 --> 05:20:16,210
Did I just accidentally zoom in?

7401
05:20:16,270 --> 05:20:18,270
You could put up quite a resistance here.

7402
05:20:18,290 --> 05:20:19,290
Sorry, I almost dropped my controller.

7403
05:20:19,470 --> 05:20:23,810
Since Mantis died, the genome soldier's brainwashing has started to wear off.

7404
05:20:23,990 --> 05:20:24,810
Can you zoom in and cut scenes?

7405
05:20:24,810 --> 05:20:26,170
I'm worried about the man's morale.

7406
05:20:27,690 --> 05:20:31,130
An alliance with the Russians would boost that as well.

7407
05:20:31,810 --> 05:20:33,290
What are you saying?

7408
05:20:34,770 --> 05:20:35,590
Oh my god.

7409
05:20:35,770 --> 05:20:37,250
We're not going anywhere.

7410
05:20:37,890 --> 05:20:39,730
We're going to dig in here.

7411
05:20:40,070 --> 05:20:40,310
What?

7412
05:20:40,430 --> 05:20:42,970
It's going to be a long war.

7413
05:20:44,370 --> 05:20:45,270
We could still escape.

7414
05:20:45,710 --> 05:20:51,290
We have the new nuclear power and we're going to ally with Golukovich's forces.

7415
05:20:51,950 --> 05:20:54,250
Are you going to fight the whole world?

7416
05:20:55,610 --> 05:20:56,990
What's wrong with that?

7417
05:20:57,170 --> 05:20:58,390
Fighting the whole world?

7418
05:20:59,090 --> 05:21:00,270
But I can't move around.

7419
05:21:01,270 --> 05:21:02,810
I can only just zoom.

7420
05:21:02,830 --> 05:21:05,310
We can launch a nuclear warhead at any target on this planet.

7421
05:21:05,550 --> 05:21:10,990
A nuclear warhead invisible to radar and totally immune to interception.

7422
05:21:11,050 --> 05:21:11,710
I can't move it though.

7423
05:21:11,710 --> 05:21:14,210
And on top of that, this base is full of...

7424
05:21:14,210 --> 05:21:17,570
Oh, I can with the other one.

7425
05:21:17,890 --> 05:21:22,990
Once we get the DNA and the money, the world will be ours.

7426
05:21:24,030 --> 05:21:27,750
But boss, what about your promise to Colonel Golukovich?

7427
05:21:30,830 --> 05:21:34,110
I have no interest in the revival of Mother Russia.

7428
05:21:35,070 --> 05:21:38,030
You're not thinking of reviving Big Boss's dream.

7429
05:21:39,530 --> 05:21:43,010
From today, you can call this place...

7430
05:21:43,010 --> 05:21:44,390
Don't say it.

7431
05:21:44,690 --> 05:21:45,290
Outer Heaven.

7432
05:21:45,530 --> 05:21:45,630
No!

7433
05:21:46,450 --> 05:21:47,650
Big Boss's dream.

7434
05:21:49,470 --> 05:21:50,670
Outer Heaven?

7435
05:21:50,710 --> 05:21:53,990
Boss, you're not worried about the POW being overridden?

7436
05:21:54,250 --> 05:21:57,570
If the code is entered again, it will be deactivated.

7437
05:21:58,190 --> 05:22:00,730
That was the most convincing delivery ever.

7438
05:22:01,070 --> 05:22:03,470
The DARPA chief and the arms tech president are both dead.

7439
05:22:04,170 --> 05:22:07,110
Does Snake know how the override system works?

7440
05:22:07,570 --> 05:22:09,930
Boss, he doesn't know how to over...

7441
05:22:09,930 --> 05:22:10,710
Oh my god, his neck.

7442
05:22:13,470 --> 05:22:14,070
Good.

7443
05:22:14,630 --> 05:22:17,730
Then no one can stop Metal Gear now.

7444
05:22:20,010 --> 05:22:21,330
Oh my god.

7445
05:22:22,230 --> 05:22:26,870
Boss, he doesn't know how to put in the detonate or the...

7446
05:22:26,870 --> 05:22:27,790
What should we do with that woman?

7447
05:22:28,510 --> 05:22:29,990
Want me to kill her?

7448
05:22:30,430 --> 05:22:31,350
Want me to kill her?

7449
05:22:31,350 --> 05:22:31,890
Let her live.

7450
05:22:32,190 --> 05:22:35,250
She's Campbell's niece and Snake cares for her.

7451
05:22:35,610 --> 05:22:39,070
We'll keep her as our ace in the hole.

7452
05:22:40,190 --> 05:22:41,610
Meryl, she's alive.

7453
05:22:41,610 --> 05:22:42,550
Meryl.

7454
05:22:45,670 --> 05:22:46,590
Moshi moshi.

7455
05:22:48,230 --> 05:22:51,750
Snake, I found Baker's top secret files.

7456
05:22:51,970 --> 05:22:52,570
Great job.

7457
05:22:53,070 --> 05:22:54,210
How's it going there?

7458
05:22:54,390 --> 05:22:56,270
They finished inputting the POW codes.

7459
05:22:56,450 --> 05:22:56,830
Oh my god.

7460
05:22:57,090 --> 05:22:58,470
So, how do we deactivate them?

7461
05:22:58,790 --> 05:23:02,310
Okay, you see, the override system that the president was talking about...

7462
05:23:02,310 --> 05:23:04,290
Did he figure out how to deactivate the POW codes?

7463
05:23:04,290 --> 05:23:06,230
It can also be used to input the detonation codes.

7464
05:23:06,870 --> 05:23:10,750
You see, if you insert the keys when the warhead is active...

7465
05:23:10,750 --> 05:23:10,790
Boss, did he figure it out?

7466
05:23:10,790 --> 05:23:12,270
You deactivate it.

7467
05:23:12,330 --> 05:23:15,710
And if you insert them when it's inactive, it becomes activated.

7468
05:23:16,010 --> 05:23:18,190
And you can only use the keys once.

7469
05:23:18,450 --> 05:23:19,490
Only once, huh?

7470
05:23:19,750 --> 05:23:21,690
You need the keys for input.

7471
05:23:22,030 --> 05:23:22,990
Three of them.

7472
05:23:23,090 --> 05:23:23,990
But I only have one.

7473
05:23:24,770 --> 05:23:26,010
Where are the others?

7474
05:23:26,330 --> 05:23:27,370
Hold on a minute.

7475
05:23:27,510 --> 05:23:28,770
You see, that's the trick.

7476
05:23:28,950 --> 05:23:31,690
You already have all three keys.

7477
05:23:32,070 --> 05:23:33,370
What are you talking about?

7478
05:23:33,530 --> 05:23:37,210
The card key is made of a shape memory alloy.

7479
05:23:37,610 --> 05:23:38,910
Shape memory alloy?

7480
05:23:38,910 --> 05:23:39,430
Yes.

7481
05:23:39,950 --> 05:23:43,250
It's a material that changes shape at different temperatures.

7482
05:23:43,530 --> 05:23:45,510
The key is made out of it.

7483
05:23:45,690 --> 05:23:46,650
This card key?

7484
05:23:46,850 --> 05:23:47,430
Yeah.

7485
05:23:47,890 --> 05:23:51,450
The card key changes shape at different temperatures.

7486
05:23:51,830 --> 05:23:55,010
So this key is actually three keys in one.

7487
05:23:55,810 --> 05:23:56,450
Clever.

7488
05:23:56,950 --> 05:23:58,030
So clever.

7489
05:23:58,590 --> 05:23:59,730
So, so clever.

7490
05:24:00,030 --> 05:24:02,910
Can you see the input terminals in the center of the control room?

7491
05:24:03,050 --> 05:24:03,470
I do.

7492
05:24:03,570 --> 05:24:05,090
They're very obviously laid out.

7493
05:24:05,250 --> 05:24:05,490
Yes.

7494
05:24:07,630 --> 05:24:08,730
I see them.

7495
05:24:08,730 --> 05:24:09,650
I think I need a... okay.

7496
05:24:09,890 --> 05:24:12,790
Those three laptop terminals are for the emergency input.

7497
05:24:12,790 --> 05:24:15,530
If you're gonna whip out your binoculars, at least zoom in.

7498
05:24:16,890 --> 05:24:17,750
Okay, thank you.

7499
05:24:18,410 --> 05:24:20,830
There should be a symbol on each screen.

7500
05:24:21,830 --> 05:24:24,770
Each symbol corresponds to a different key.

7501
05:24:24,950 --> 05:24:28,710
You input the keys in order from left to right.

7502
05:24:29,170 --> 05:24:31,670
The left ones for the room temperature key.

7503
05:24:31,950 --> 05:24:32,930
See the symbol?

7504
05:24:33,070 --> 05:24:33,430
Yes.

7505
05:24:33,810 --> 05:24:36,270
Next to that goes the low temperature key.

7506
05:24:36,430 --> 05:24:36,650
Ah.

7507
05:24:36,650 --> 05:24:39,490
The one on the right is the high temperature key.

7508
05:24:39,510 --> 05:24:39,530
Ah.

7509
05:24:40,070 --> 05:24:40,550
Okay.

7510
05:24:40,910 --> 05:24:42,210
Okay, I got it.

7511
05:24:42,270 --> 05:24:42,730
I got it.

7512
05:24:42,730 --> 05:24:46,530
First I change the shape of the card, and then I input them in order, right?

7513
05:24:47,110 --> 05:24:47,790
That's right.

7514
05:24:47,990 --> 05:24:50,530
All you do is insert the card keys.

7515
05:24:51,270 --> 05:24:54,970
After you insert the key into the module, a hard disk...

7516
05:24:54,970 --> 05:24:55,870
They're just standing there.

7517
05:24:56,710 --> 05:24:57,810
They're not even talking.

7518
05:24:57,970 --> 05:25:01,410
Once you've finished with all three terminals, the code input process is complete.

7519
05:25:02,430 --> 05:25:03,590
But here's the thing.

7520
05:25:03,770 --> 05:25:06,390
You can only use the key three times.

7521
05:25:06,850 --> 05:25:09,870
It's an emergency system, and it's only meant to be used once.

7522
05:25:10,770 --> 05:25:13,610
In awkward gatherings, I employ solid snake conversation.

7523
05:25:14,390 --> 05:25:14,730
The world is riding on that key, snake.

7524
05:25:16,270 --> 05:25:18,810
I just say what they said, but ask it in a question.

7525
05:25:20,330 --> 05:25:20,770
Smar.

7526
05:25:23,330 --> 05:25:23,930
Who's that?

7527
05:25:28,530 --> 05:25:29,330
Oh my god!

7528
05:25:29,970 --> 05:25:30,410
Snake!

7529
05:25:30,510 --> 05:25:31,430
Oh, oh, oh.

7530
05:25:31,450 --> 05:25:32,710
He's looking at the bullet.

7531
05:25:35,430 --> 05:25:37,830
Oh no, I forgot about this part.

7532
05:25:38,250 --> 05:25:39,970
Our card key!

7533
05:25:43,520 --> 05:25:44,750
Oh, so clumsy.

7534
05:25:45,150 --> 05:25:47,050
The key fell in the drainage ditch.

7535
05:25:47,370 --> 05:25:49,170
The key fell in the drainage ditch.

7536
05:25:49,510 --> 05:25:50,090
Ouch!

7537
05:25:50,930 --> 05:25:53,190
This is bulletproof glass.

7538
05:25:53,610 --> 05:25:55,350
There's no way in.

7539
05:25:55,990 --> 05:25:57,690
Kyle and Joy watching you die.

7540
05:25:57,690 --> 05:25:59,730
This is bulletproof glass.

7541
05:26:01,050 --> 05:26:01,830
Snake.

7542
05:26:01,830 --> 05:26:04,150
You've got to get that key.

7543
05:26:06,090 --> 05:26:06,690
Snake.

7544
05:26:07,310 --> 05:26:09,630
This is bulletproof glass.

7545
05:26:12,030 --> 05:26:13,730
Okay, I'll go get it.

7546
05:26:17,830 --> 05:26:18,430
So...

7547
05:26:18,430 --> 05:26:21,450
The people I'm seeing walking is them, right?

7548
05:26:22,590 --> 05:26:23,190
Like...

7549
05:26:23,190 --> 05:26:23,890
Oh.

7550
05:26:25,310 --> 05:26:25,910
Wait.

7551
05:26:30,410 --> 05:26:31,890
Yeah, it's them inside.

7552
05:26:32,150 --> 05:26:32,710
That's so funny.

7553
05:26:38,570 --> 05:26:38,970
Okay.

7554
05:26:39,810 --> 05:26:40,210
Alright.

7555
05:26:40,590 --> 05:26:42,030
Let's go get us...

7556
05:26:42,910 --> 05:26:44,290
Let's go get us a card key.

7557
05:26:50,710 --> 05:26:53,830
I could use some more bullets, especially since I ran out.

7558
05:26:54,290 --> 05:26:55,490
Where are my famas?

7559
05:26:56,130 --> 05:26:56,530
25...

7560
05:26:56,530 --> 05:26:56,870
Oh.

7561
05:26:57,190 --> 05:26:57,850
Oh my god.

7562
05:26:57,990 --> 05:26:58,590
No way.

7563
05:26:58,730 --> 05:26:59,070
Who's there?

7564
05:26:59,670 --> 05:27:00,510
Where were you?

7565
05:27:01,390 --> 05:27:01,790
Where?

7566
05:27:02,150 --> 05:27:03,050
Where were you?

7567
05:27:03,590 --> 05:27:04,870
Where were you the whole time?

7568
05:27:05,270 --> 05:27:06,090
Where were you?

7569
05:27:08,250 --> 05:27:09,050
Wait, actually...

7570
05:27:09,050 --> 05:27:09,790
Let's see.

7571
05:27:10,010 --> 05:27:10,410
Let's...

7572
05:27:10,410 --> 05:27:10,910
Maybe we can...

7573
05:27:10,910 --> 05:27:12,150
Oh, but if I...

7574
05:27:15,670 --> 05:27:16,710
I don't know.

7575
05:27:16,790 --> 05:27:18,050
If I put him down...

7576
05:27:18,050 --> 05:27:21,470
If I make him sleepy...

7577
05:27:22,030 --> 05:27:23,170
Where is your status report?

7578
05:27:23,430 --> 05:27:24,010
It's fine.

7579
05:27:28,410 --> 05:27:29,230
Maybe it's fine.

7580
05:27:31,910 --> 05:27:32,650
Maybe it's fine.

7581
05:27:33,670 --> 05:27:34,330
Excuse me.

7582
05:27:35,530 --> 05:27:35,970
Um...

7583
05:27:35,970 --> 05:27:37,610
Are there any other guys?

7584
05:27:38,230 --> 05:27:39,730
They're not showing up if there are.

7585
05:27:40,070 --> 05:27:40,470
Wait.

7586
05:27:40,530 --> 05:27:41,110
Can I go down here?

7587
05:27:41,410 --> 05:27:42,150
What's down here?

7588
05:27:42,870 --> 05:27:43,310
Uh...

7589
05:27:43,310 --> 05:27:43,410
Okay.

7590
05:27:45,560 --> 05:27:47,040
There's a lot of...

7591
05:27:47,040 --> 05:27:47,240
Wait.

7592
05:27:47,420 --> 05:27:48,020
I don't...

7593
05:27:48,500 --> 05:27:49,080
This is...

7594
05:27:49,080 --> 05:27:50,440
This is not used to be here, right?

7595
05:27:53,000 --> 05:27:53,440
Right?

7596
05:27:54,020 --> 05:27:54,660
This is...

7597
05:27:54,660 --> 05:27:55,500
This is new, right?

7598
05:27:57,240 --> 05:27:57,680
Bandage.

7599
05:28:03,660 --> 05:28:04,100
Okay.

7600
05:28:05,040 --> 05:28:07,160
I feel like I hear someone else walking around.

7601
05:28:08,320 --> 05:28:09,420
I don't think it's me.

7602
05:28:10,160 --> 05:28:14,420
But I don't see anyone else on the radar, so it's just...

7603
05:28:14,940 --> 05:28:16,060
This is completely different.

7604
05:28:16,660 --> 05:28:17,100
Okay.

7605
05:28:26,070 --> 05:28:26,510
Sorry.

7606
05:28:26,610 --> 05:28:27,210
I'm gonna shoot your bow.

7607
05:28:27,210 --> 05:28:27,450
But...

7608
05:28:30,900 --> 05:28:31,280
Okay.

7609
05:28:32,260 --> 05:28:32,820
All right.

7610
05:28:33,000 --> 05:28:33,380
Uh...

7611
05:28:33,380 --> 05:28:33,740
Wait.

7612
05:28:33,800 --> 05:28:34,560
I came this way.

7613
05:28:34,800 --> 05:28:35,180
Okay.

7614
05:28:36,780 --> 05:28:37,440
Now I...

7615
05:28:37,440 --> 05:28:38,660
At least I know where they're at.

7616
05:28:38,800 --> 05:28:45,960
Before, I think what the trouble was, was I was like seeing them on the radar, but there's so many tiny little stairs areas in here that I'm like...

7617
05:28:46,580 --> 05:28:48,960
I didn't know where they were walking at, you know?

7618
05:28:49,360 --> 05:28:51,220
But now, we at least know where...

7619
05:28:51,220 --> 05:28:51,680
Wait.

7620
05:28:51,760 --> 05:28:52,340
How do I...

7621
05:28:52,340 --> 05:28:53,540
How do I get down?

7622
05:28:54,120 --> 05:28:54,500
Um...

7623
05:28:54,500 --> 05:28:55,380
I'm lost.

7624
05:28:56,160 --> 05:28:56,540
Wait.

7625
05:28:56,600 --> 05:28:56,820
I'm lost.

7626
05:28:58,600 --> 05:28:58,960
Uh...

7627
05:28:58,960 --> 05:28:59,540
Here.

7628
05:28:59,660 --> 05:28:59,760
Here.

7629
05:28:59,820 --> 05:28:59,920
Here.

7630
05:29:00,520 --> 05:29:01,180
Let's grab this.

7631
05:29:01,500 --> 05:29:01,860
Nope.

7632
05:29:01,880 --> 05:29:02,200
Just kidding.

7633
05:29:02,900 --> 05:29:03,260
Okay.

7634
05:29:09,470 --> 05:29:10,430
I'm hearing something.

7635
05:29:13,710 --> 05:29:14,870
What the heck am I hearing?

7636
05:29:16,850 --> 05:29:17,530
Look at them.

7637
05:29:17,530 --> 05:29:19,110
They're in there talking with each other.

7638
05:29:23,500 --> 05:29:23,860
Okay.

7639
05:29:23,980 --> 05:29:24,340
Nice.

7640
05:29:24,620 --> 05:29:24,820
Nice.

7641
05:29:24,880 --> 05:29:25,000
Nice.

7642
05:29:25,000 --> 05:29:25,140
Nice.

7643
05:29:26,060 --> 05:29:29,020
If I put on the body armor, does it help?

7644
05:29:31,820 --> 05:29:32,300
Ta-da.

7645
05:29:33,400 --> 05:29:34,580
How do I find this thing?

7646
05:29:35,040 --> 05:29:35,400
Oh.

7647
05:29:35,420 --> 05:29:36,660
We got more bullets?

7648
05:29:39,260 --> 05:29:40,220
We got a...

7649
05:29:40,220 --> 05:29:40,920
A time bomb?

7650
05:29:42,000 --> 05:29:42,980
Wait a second.

7651
05:29:45,220 --> 05:29:45,820
Ocelot!

7652
05:29:46,420 --> 05:29:47,340
Where is that?

7653
05:29:47,740 --> 05:29:48,920
Where's the time bomb?

7654
05:29:54,490 --> 05:29:54,890
Oh.

7655
05:29:55,010 --> 05:29:55,610
Oh.

7656
05:29:57,790 --> 05:29:58,390
Wow.

7657
05:30:00,330 --> 05:30:00,930
Gosh.

7658
05:30:04,130 --> 05:30:04,730
Uh.

7659
05:30:04,790 --> 05:30:05,230
Uh.

7660
05:30:05,250 --> 05:30:05,930
Please, Snake.

7661
05:30:07,610 --> 05:30:08,210
Hmm.

7662
05:30:08,470 --> 05:30:08,990
Oh.

7663
05:30:08,990 --> 05:30:09,070
Oh.

7664
05:30:11,110 --> 05:30:12,110
Maybe it's down here.

7665
05:30:12,670 --> 05:30:12,970
Oh.

7666
05:30:13,010 --> 05:30:13,250
Ration.

7667
05:30:13,390 --> 05:30:13,710
Nice.

7668
05:30:14,010 --> 05:30:14,670
Take it.

7669
05:30:18,880 --> 05:30:20,140
Rex's bath water.

7670
05:30:21,320 --> 05:30:24,560
If you drink this, you will literally get super power.

7671
05:30:27,960 --> 05:30:29,440
I hope these guys aren't awake.

7672
05:30:30,700 --> 05:30:31,220
Okay.

7673
05:30:31,760 --> 05:30:32,280
Okay.

7674
05:30:32,700 --> 05:30:33,220
Palky!

7675
05:30:39,330 --> 05:30:39,850
Okay.

7676
05:30:42,810 --> 05:30:43,730
There we go.

7677
05:30:44,990 --> 05:30:45,750
Very nice.

7678
05:30:45,750 --> 05:30:48,430
Gotta go all the way back.

7679
05:30:49,390 --> 05:30:50,390
You will be...

7680
05:30:50,390 --> 05:30:50,850
You will...

7681
05:30:50,850 --> 05:30:55,230
You will become the world's most powerful soldier if you drink this water.

7682
05:31:02,010 --> 05:31:03,910
Any VTuber fan will be honored.

7683
05:31:07,580 --> 05:31:09,440
Hopefully these guys are still...

7684
05:31:11,100 --> 05:31:12,300
Just take you there.

7685
05:31:12,480 --> 05:31:12,980
Yeah.

7686
05:31:13,380 --> 05:31:14,740
Give you a little extra.

7687
05:31:16,340 --> 05:31:17,420
And this guy too.

7688
05:31:18,320 --> 05:31:18,860
Yeah.

7689
05:31:18,860 --> 05:31:20,180
Oh, you only got two.

7690
05:31:20,900 --> 05:31:21,560
There you go.

7691
05:31:21,600 --> 05:31:22,320
Now you got three.

7692
05:31:27,360 --> 05:31:27,720
Okay.

7693
05:31:30,520 --> 05:31:31,700
They do come back here, right?

7694
05:31:31,760 --> 05:31:32,020
Yeah.

7695
05:31:32,100 --> 05:31:32,360
Right?

7696
05:31:34,720 --> 05:31:35,660
Then I go inside.

7697
05:31:38,020 --> 05:31:38,660
Oh, they're gone.

7698
05:31:42,100 --> 05:31:43,100
Where could they have gone?

7699
05:31:51,870 --> 05:31:52,470
Very good.

7700
05:31:53,870 --> 05:31:54,310
Hmm.

7701
05:31:56,790 --> 05:31:57,230
Nicely.

7702
05:31:59,450 --> 05:32:00,290
Do I just...

7703
05:32:00,970 --> 05:32:01,410
Okay.

7704
05:32:01,490 --> 05:32:02,110
So this one...

7705
05:32:02,110 --> 05:32:04,910
First our little Palky.

7706
05:32:06,690 --> 05:32:07,130
Insert!

7707
05:32:09,450 --> 05:32:11,090
Call Otakon now that you found the key?

7708
05:32:11,230 --> 05:32:11,450
Okay.

7709
05:32:11,850 --> 05:32:12,390
Oh yeah.

7710
05:32:12,450 --> 05:32:13,170
I should be calling people.

7711
05:32:16,110 --> 05:32:18,150
Snake, we input the PAL codes.

7712
05:32:19,470 --> 05:32:20,330
Colonel, I'm scared.

7713
05:32:20,950 --> 05:32:21,970
What if it doesn't work?

7714
05:32:22,070 --> 05:32:22,510
I'll get you.

7715
05:32:22,530 --> 05:32:24,850
What if you're... What if you're tricking me?

7716
05:32:31,010 --> 05:32:32,310
Yes, of course, Master.

7717
05:32:32,430 --> 05:32:34,010
He's the only one I can trust, so it's fine.

7718
05:32:39,630 --> 05:32:40,030
Yes.

7719
05:32:42,690 --> 05:32:43,090
Yes.

7720
05:32:45,750 --> 05:32:46,150
Ooh.

7721
05:32:47,290 --> 05:32:47,690
Ooh.

7722
05:32:52,530 --> 05:32:54,050
It's been changed to the correct shape.

7723
05:32:54,230 --> 05:33:00,150
It won't be recognized by the PAL code input terminal in the control room, and the detonation code won't be entered.

7724
05:33:01,610 --> 05:33:02,050
So...

7725
05:33:04,610 --> 05:33:05,730
I could just...

7726
05:33:06,490 --> 05:33:08,890
What if I... What if I mess it up a little?

7727
05:33:09,230 --> 05:33:10,550
What if I just...

7728
05:33:11,070 --> 05:33:11,450
Oh, wait.

7729
05:33:12,350 --> 05:33:13,450
It's not activated.

7730
05:33:13,750 --> 05:33:14,410
Oh, I mean, sorry.

7731
05:33:14,570 --> 05:33:15,910
We're deactivating it.

7732
05:33:16,210 --> 05:33:21,930
But I think I mentioned this earlier, but there's actually an easier way to do some of these...

7733
05:33:22,730 --> 05:33:23,090
Like...

7734
05:33:23,910 --> 05:33:24,610
I think...

7735
05:33:24,610 --> 05:33:25,570
I think it's...

7736
05:33:25,570 --> 05:33:26,170
Well...

7737
05:33:26,170 --> 05:33:33,130
You, like, have to shoot a pipe, and it will allow you to do the hot and the cold, not having to go all the way back.

7738
05:33:33,750 --> 05:33:34,110
So...

7739
05:33:35,030 --> 05:33:35,550
We'll see.

7740
05:33:39,270 --> 05:33:39,630
Anyway.

7741
05:33:39,970 --> 05:33:40,430
Beep, beep!

7742
05:33:41,930 --> 05:33:43,690
Yeah, there's a land with a hot and a cold pipe.

7743
05:33:43,770 --> 05:33:44,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

7744
05:33:45,290 --> 05:33:46,270
So, I'm... I don't know.

7745
05:33:46,310 --> 05:33:49,650
I might do it the quick way, because I think it's kind of cool that it's unique to this game.

7746
05:34:00,040 --> 05:34:00,400
Alright!

7747
05:34:00,620 --> 05:34:03,160
Rex, you're not getting activated today!

7748
05:34:05,200 --> 05:34:05,880
And...

7749
05:34:05,880 --> 05:34:06,020
Oh!

7750
05:34:06,120 --> 05:34:06,840
Gas attacked!

7751
05:34:12,300 --> 05:34:12,980
Nice.

7752
05:34:18,320 --> 05:34:18,660
Nice.

7753
05:34:22,540 --> 05:34:23,220
Oh.

7754
05:34:25,420 --> 05:34:25,760
Wait.

7755
05:34:27,580 --> 05:34:29,940
Do I get gas attacked when I complete them?

7756
05:34:32,300 --> 05:34:32,920
Let's go.

7757
05:34:38,220 --> 05:34:39,560
Oh, I forgot.

7758
05:34:42,180 --> 05:34:43,380
Oh, he's still down.

7759
05:34:44,070 --> 05:34:44,460
Let's go.

7760
05:34:45,070 --> 05:34:45,660
Now, I...

7761
05:34:45,660 --> 05:34:45,980
OK.

7762
05:34:46,160 --> 05:34:47,600
Now, the issue is...

7763
05:34:47,600 --> 05:34:49,800
I don't actually know where these pipes are.

7764
05:34:51,580 --> 05:34:52,820
I think...

7765
05:34:52,820 --> 05:34:53,340
Ah!

7766
05:34:55,000 --> 05:34:56,040
Look at them.

7767
05:34:57,360 --> 05:34:58,100
Slumbering baby.

7768
05:34:59,680 --> 05:35:02,140
I think they're over on...

7769
05:35:02,140 --> 05:35:03,800
this side.

7770
05:35:03,800 --> 05:35:05,100
I missed the zoom.

7771
05:35:05,280 --> 05:35:05,780
Me too.

7772
05:35:06,660 --> 05:35:08,680
This music is kinda creepy.

7773
05:35:09,620 --> 05:35:12,560
But it's just... it's not the vibe, you know?

7774
05:35:17,020 --> 05:35:19,260
I don't know exactly where these are.

7775
05:35:19,700 --> 05:35:22,940
Top floor, right side, hang drop, catch, down.

7776
05:35:24,160 --> 05:35:24,900
Like here?

7777
05:35:25,740 --> 05:35:27,320
Wait, hang drop from where?

7778
05:35:28,480 --> 05:35:30,280
Oh gosh, I have to catch going down?

7779
05:35:30,780 --> 05:35:31,000
Oof.

7780
05:35:33,120 --> 05:35:34,440
We might have a problem.

7781
05:35:35,580 --> 05:35:35,980
Wait.

7782
05:35:39,330 --> 05:35:39,890
Hold on.

7783
05:35:39,990 --> 05:35:40,830
Can I see it?

7784
05:35:41,370 --> 05:35:42,450
Where I need to drop?

7785
05:35:43,270 --> 05:35:45,530
I love that I just walk all over their bodies.

7786
05:35:46,590 --> 05:35:47,110
Let's see.

7787
05:35:47,470 --> 05:35:48,650
Is there one that...

7788
05:35:51,190 --> 05:35:51,590
Maybe.

7789
05:35:56,310 --> 05:35:57,410
Or just take the stairs.

7790
05:35:57,530 --> 05:35:58,470
I'm looking to see... like this!

7791
05:35:58,650 --> 05:35:59,410
There it is!

7792
05:35:59,650 --> 05:36:00,010
Okay.

7793
05:36:00,550 --> 05:36:01,650
Okay, so I... right?

7794
05:36:01,690 --> 05:36:03,270
Okay, so you can't access it.

7795
05:36:03,330 --> 05:36:04,430
That's what I was just checking.

7796
05:36:04,650 --> 05:36:05,830
So you have to hang from here.

7797
05:36:06,990 --> 05:36:07,390
Okay.

7798
05:36:07,490 --> 05:36:07,850
Okay.

7799
05:36:08,110 --> 05:36:08,510
Wait.

7800
05:36:08,710 --> 05:36:09,050
So...

7801
05:36:09,550 --> 05:36:11,650
To drop, down, catch...

7802
05:36:11,650 --> 05:36:12,570
I don't know the controls.

7803
05:36:13,790 --> 05:36:15,850
I don't know the controls actually.

7804
05:36:17,070 --> 05:36:17,710
Hmm...

7805
05:36:19,030 --> 05:36:19,990
Okay, hold on.

7806
05:36:20,450 --> 05:36:21,090
Shoot.

7807
05:36:21,450 --> 05:36:22,770
It's action...

7808
05:36:23,650 --> 05:36:24,290
And...

7809
05:36:28,630 --> 05:36:29,550
Uh...

7810
05:36:29,550 --> 05:36:30,570
Drop...

7811
05:36:32,290 --> 05:36:32,930
Nope.

7812
05:36:33,070 --> 05:36:33,670
Uh...

7813
05:36:33,670 --> 05:36:35,770
Wait, I don't know the controls.

7814
05:36:37,230 --> 05:36:37,870
Uh...

7815
05:36:39,250 --> 05:36:40,210
I did it!

7816
05:36:40,450 --> 05:36:41,610
First try, baby!

7817
05:36:41,610 --> 05:36:42,770
First try!

7818
05:36:43,710 --> 05:36:44,290
Nice!

7819
05:36:44,630 --> 05:36:45,670
Nice, nice, nice!

7820
05:36:47,130 --> 05:36:47,710
Okay.

7821
05:36:47,710 --> 05:36:48,290
Alrighty.

7822
05:36:48,790 --> 05:36:49,070
Uh...

7823
05:36:49,830 --> 05:36:50,990
Liquid nitrogen.

7824
05:36:53,130 --> 05:36:53,710
Ouch!

7825
05:36:53,710 --> 05:36:54,290
Ouch!

7826
05:36:54,430 --> 05:36:55,550
Did that actually hurt me?

7827
05:36:58,310 --> 05:36:58,890
Nice.

7828
05:37:03,170 --> 05:37:03,750
Oh!

7829
05:37:03,890 --> 05:37:04,690
It's already cold!

7830
05:37:04,890 --> 05:37:05,750
That was so fast.

7831
05:37:06,010 --> 05:37:06,550
Alrighty.

7832
05:37:07,110 --> 05:37:07,690
Um...

7833
05:37:08,230 --> 05:37:08,830
Al...

7834
05:37:09,750 --> 05:37:10,330
Ali...

7835
05:37:10,330 --> 05:37:10,910
Ali...

7836
05:37:10,910 --> 05:37:11,070
Oop!

7837
05:37:11,810 --> 05:37:12,950
Where's this gonna drop me?

7838
05:37:12,950 --> 05:37:13,690
Oh, whoops.

7839
05:37:13,890 --> 05:37:14,170
Uh...

7840
05:37:15,190 --> 05:37:15,590
Uh...

7841
05:37:15,590 --> 05:37:15,930
Uh...

7842
05:37:16,690 --> 05:37:17,090
And...

7843
05:37:17,090 --> 05:37:17,570
Drop.

7844
05:37:18,490 --> 05:37:18,890
Oop.

7845
05:37:19,010 --> 05:37:19,530
My bad.

7846
05:37:19,710 --> 05:37:20,270
We're fine.

7847
05:37:20,410 --> 05:37:20,930
Come on, snake.

7848
05:37:21,030 --> 05:37:21,510
Shake it off.

7849
05:37:21,630 --> 05:37:22,070
Shake it off.

7850
05:37:25,430 --> 05:37:26,170
It's actually...

7851
05:37:26,170 --> 05:37:26,310
Okay!

7852
05:37:26,430 --> 05:37:27,190
That's so cool!

7853
05:37:27,470 --> 05:37:28,050
Oh my gosh.

7854
05:37:28,730 --> 05:37:29,490
How nice.

7855
05:37:30,090 --> 05:37:32,450
I'm just gonna keep shooting these guys every time I go past them.

7856
05:37:33,210 --> 05:37:34,790
No use in having them wake up.

7857
05:37:34,990 --> 05:37:36,330
I mean, honestly, I could just kill them.

7858
05:37:36,810 --> 05:37:37,450
Then they...

7859
05:37:37,450 --> 05:37:38,950
Then they'd never be a bother.

7860
05:37:41,470 --> 05:37:42,170
Then they...

7861
05:37:42,170 --> 05:37:42,690
Ne...

7862
05:37:42,690 --> 05:37:44,230
They would never wake up.

7863
05:37:47,150 --> 05:37:47,670
Yeah.

7864
05:37:49,630 --> 05:37:50,970
Is that just for twin snakes?

7865
05:37:51,150 --> 05:37:52,990
Yes, it is just for twin snakes.

7866
05:37:54,530 --> 05:37:55,050
So...

7867
05:37:55,690 --> 05:37:55,970
Um...

7868
05:37:55,970 --> 05:37:56,990
You will not find that.

7869
05:37:57,190 --> 05:37:59,330
Because you can't hang in, um...

7870
05:38:00,290 --> 05:38:01,270
In, uh...

7871
05:38:01,270 --> 05:38:02,750
Regular Metal Gear Solid.

7872
05:38:04,910 --> 05:38:05,650
Number two!

7873
05:38:17,950 --> 05:38:19,950
You've killed so many, why hold back on these two?

7874
05:38:20,610 --> 05:38:21,230
That's true.

7875
05:38:21,270 --> 05:38:22,870
They did give me a really hard time.

7876
05:38:23,310 --> 05:38:23,930
They did.

7877
05:38:25,270 --> 05:38:27,130
I am still annoyed at the fact...

7878
05:38:27,130 --> 05:38:28,050
At the fact that they...

7879
05:38:28,630 --> 05:38:30,310
I'm still annoyed at the fact that they...

7880
05:38:30,310 --> 05:38:32,310
Gave me a hard time because I didn't know where they were.

7881
05:38:33,090 --> 05:38:33,410
Yeah.

7882
05:38:33,790 --> 05:38:35,930
Pal code number two confirmed.

7883
05:38:36,570 --> 05:38:36,970
Yahoo!

7884
05:38:38,170 --> 05:38:39,910
Awaiting pal code number three.

7885
05:38:40,450 --> 05:38:41,970
Mint, this saves you like 15 minutes.

7886
05:38:42,090 --> 05:38:42,350
I know!

7887
05:38:42,450 --> 05:38:42,610
Okay.

7888
05:38:42,610 --> 05:38:42,970
Here goes pal code number two.

7889
05:38:43,590 --> 05:38:44,610
It's kind of awesome.

7890
05:38:44,890 --> 05:38:46,510
Next comes pal number three.

7891
05:38:47,070 --> 05:38:47,890
Warm the key.

7892
05:38:48,030 --> 05:38:49,650
Which is so funny because like...

7893
05:38:49,650 --> 05:38:51,070
I was so...

7894
05:38:51,070 --> 05:38:51,690
Maybe...

7895
05:38:51,690 --> 05:38:54,270
Maybe I feel like I'm more okay with doing this because...

7896
05:38:54,270 --> 05:38:56,650
I was so adamant about the, um...

7897
05:38:57,490 --> 05:38:58,370
About the...

7898
05:38:59,230 --> 05:38:59,670
Sniper...

7899
05:38:59,670 --> 05:39:01,850
About the PSG-1 that like...

7900
05:39:01,850 --> 05:39:04,270
And it took so long for me to get it.

7901
05:39:04,430 --> 05:39:05,370
That I'm like, you know what?

7902
05:39:05,430 --> 05:39:06,270
We can save a couple.

7903
05:39:07,450 --> 05:39:10,310
We can save some minutes because I...

7904
05:39:10,310 --> 05:39:10,870
Um...

7905
05:39:13,460 --> 05:39:14,360
I messed up.

7906
05:39:14,420 --> 05:39:14,640
I messed up.

7907
05:39:14,640 --> 05:39:14,800
I messed up.

7908
05:39:14,820 --> 05:39:16,060
I was so bad at the beginning.

7909
05:39:17,360 --> 05:39:19,800
But it's also funny because I'm trying to like...

7910
05:39:19,800 --> 05:39:22,400
I'm not trying to remain like faithful to the original.

7911
05:39:22,560 --> 05:39:26,080
It's just that I feel like the cutscenes work better when you don't use like...

7912
05:39:27,400 --> 05:39:28,280
A tranquilizer.

7913
05:39:28,680 --> 05:39:29,120
Like...

7914
05:39:29,740 --> 05:39:30,180
Everybody...

7915
05:39:30,180 --> 05:39:31,340
Everybody in this game dies.

7916
05:39:31,460 --> 05:39:32,140
It's not...

7917
05:39:33,160 --> 05:39:34,220
It's not a happy ending.

7918
05:39:34,980 --> 05:39:35,420
Okay.

7919
05:39:35,520 --> 05:39:35,940
Shoot.

7920
05:39:36,000 --> 05:39:36,420
What was it?

7921
05:39:36,880 --> 05:39:37,320
Okay.

7922
05:39:37,480 --> 05:39:37,860
Uh...

7923
05:39:37,860 --> 05:39:38,680
You...

7924
05:39:40,500 --> 05:39:40,940
Nice!

7925
05:39:42,760 --> 05:39:43,620
Hey, yo!

7926
05:39:44,060 --> 05:39:44,500
Hey, yo!

7927
05:39:44,500 --> 05:39:44,800
Hey, yo!

7928
05:39:44,820 --> 05:39:45,420
Hey, yo!

7929
05:39:45,440 --> 05:39:45,900
Hey, yo!

7930
05:39:48,300 --> 05:39:48,800
Ouch!

7931
05:39:49,100 --> 05:39:49,600
Oh...

7932
05:39:49,600 --> 05:39:50,220
Uh...

7933
05:39:51,240 --> 05:39:51,740
Falky...

7934
05:39:52,500 --> 05:39:53,840
And it's hot, baby!

7935
05:39:54,100 --> 05:39:54,460
Oh!

7936
05:39:54,460 --> 05:39:55,220
It's on fire!

7937
05:39:55,440 --> 05:39:55,760
It's...

7938
05:39:55,760 --> 05:39:56,800
It's hot!

7939
05:40:01,920 --> 05:40:03,900
They die in MGS3 too?

7940
05:40:04,040 --> 05:40:04,180
Uh...

7941
05:40:04,180 --> 05:40:05,140
They die from explosion.

7942
05:40:05,580 --> 05:40:06,980
So it doesn't matter...

7943
05:40:07,780 --> 05:40:09,340
It doesn't matter what I do.

7944
05:40:12,180 --> 05:40:12,680
Reek!

7945
05:40:12,680 --> 05:40:12,900
Thank you!

7946
05:40:15,280 --> 05:40:17,180
Hati has her own route and occupants...

7947
05:40:17,180 --> 05:40:17,800
I have...

7948
05:40:18,260 --> 05:40:20,280
Also the Metal Gear...

7949
05:40:20,280 --> 05:40:20,560
Solid...

7950
05:40:20,560 --> 05:40:21,680
Oh, hold on.

7951
05:40:21,900 --> 05:40:22,580
I'll read it.

7952
05:40:22,620 --> 05:40:23,140
Reach in a second.

7953
05:40:23,240 --> 05:40:24,140
I didn't want the Colonel to hear.

7954
05:40:24,740 --> 05:40:25,920
Okay, so what's up?

7955
05:40:26,240 --> 05:40:27,960
I've got a good friend in the Pentagon.

7956
05:40:28,500 --> 05:40:28,740
Yeah.

7957
05:40:28,920 --> 05:40:29,360
Yeah?

7958
05:40:29,680 --> 05:40:31,380
He's the one who told me about it.

7959
05:40:31,420 --> 05:40:31,560
Yeah?

7960
05:40:31,780 --> 05:40:35,980
It looks like the DIA recently developed a new type of assassination weapon.

7961
05:40:36,220 --> 05:40:37,580
An assassination weapon?

7962
05:40:38,240 --> 05:40:38,680
Snake.

7963
05:40:38,920 --> 05:40:41,600
Have you ever heard of something called Foxdye?

7964
05:40:41,840 --> 05:40:42,240
No.

7965
05:40:43,180 --> 05:40:44,380
That's what they mentioned earlier.

7966
05:40:45,040 --> 05:40:45,480
Foxdye?

7967
05:40:45,700 --> 05:40:46,140
Foxdye.

7968
05:40:46,160 --> 05:40:46,380
Yeah.

7969
05:40:46,480 --> 05:40:47,800
Liquid and the others were talking about it.

7970
05:40:47,800 --> 05:40:49,160
Yeah, the others.

7971
05:40:49,480 --> 05:40:50,000
The one other.

7972
05:40:50,000 --> 05:40:52,700
It's some kind of virus that targets specific people.

7973
05:40:52,880 --> 05:40:53,240
Ocelot?

7974
05:40:53,460 --> 05:40:55,060
I don't know all the details, but...

7975
05:40:55,060 --> 05:40:56,600
What are you trying to say?

7976
05:40:56,860 --> 05:40:57,140
Oh, yeah.

7977
05:40:57,200 --> 05:40:57,640
What are you trying...

7978
05:40:57,640 --> 05:40:58,640
It's too similar.

7979
05:40:58,940 --> 05:40:59,560
What is?

7980
05:40:59,960 --> 05:41:01,380
The cause of death.

7981
05:41:01,780 --> 05:41:08,560
Didn't the arms tech president and the DARPA chief, I mean, Decoy Octopus, die of something that looked like a heart attack?

7982
05:41:08,840 --> 05:41:09,180
Yeah.

7983
05:41:09,400 --> 05:41:14,540
Well, apparently, Foxdye kills its victims by simulating a heart attack.

7984
05:41:14,700 --> 05:41:15,000
No!

7985
05:41:16,240 --> 05:41:16,760
No.

7986
05:41:16,760 --> 05:41:17,080
You're right.

7987
05:41:17,420 --> 05:41:17,560
No.

7988
05:41:17,560 --> 05:41:17,580
No.

7989
05:41:17,580 --> 05:41:17,660
No.

7990
05:41:17,800 --> 05:41:19,520
Is he telling me that Naomi was behind it?

7991
05:41:19,780 --> 05:41:21,240
Snake, try to remember.

7992
05:41:21,500 --> 05:41:23,960
Did Naomi give you some kind of injection?

7993
05:41:25,060 --> 05:41:26,100
The nanomachines.

7994
05:41:26,120 --> 05:41:26,900
The nanomachines.

7995
05:41:26,920 --> 05:41:30,760
She was in the best position to have done it, but I don't know what her motive was.

7996
05:41:30,880 --> 05:41:31,440
Oh my God.

7997
05:41:31,600 --> 05:41:32,380
Does the Colonel know?

7998
05:41:32,880 --> 05:41:35,340
I'm not sure, but he still hasn't questioned it.

7999
05:41:35,340 --> 05:41:35,620
Jedi.

8000
05:41:36,340 --> 05:41:36,600
Okay.

8001
05:41:37,540 --> 05:41:38,060
Foxdye.

8002
05:41:38,080 --> 05:41:38,600
Jedi.

8003
05:41:39,200 --> 05:41:41,480
Colonel, what's new with the Naomi situation?

8004
05:41:41,980 --> 05:41:43,940
I just placed Naomi under arrest.

8005
05:41:43,940 --> 05:41:43,960
She's arrested.

8006
05:41:43,960 --> 05:41:43,980
Yeah!

8007
05:41:44,880 --> 05:41:45,400
Arrested.

8008
05:41:45,400 --> 05:41:46,640
Take her butt to jail.

8009
05:41:46,640 --> 05:41:47,640
She was sending coded mails.

8010
05:41:47,640 --> 05:41:47,780
She was sending coded mails.

8011
05:41:50,920 --> 05:41:53,900
Oh my god.

8012
05:41:55,300 --> 05:41:56,340
Oh my god.

8013
05:41:57,780 --> 05:41:59,260
She's working with them.

8014
05:42:00,300 --> 05:42:00,900
Yeah.

8015
05:42:05,940 --> 05:42:07,400
That's the true stuff, right?

8016
05:42:11,520 --> 05:42:12,340
Fox alive.

8017
05:42:13,920 --> 05:42:14,640
I can.

8018
05:42:17,800 --> 05:42:18,940
Is that all you think about?

8019
05:42:19,180 --> 05:42:22,640
But Snake, you might be infected too, you know.

8020
05:42:22,700 --> 05:42:23,040
Uh oh.

8021
05:42:23,080 --> 05:42:24,960
All I can do is leave it up to the Colonel.

8022
05:42:25,960 --> 05:42:26,920
I mean...

8023
05:42:28,600 --> 05:42:29,080
Uh...

8024
05:42:29,600 --> 05:42:30,260
I mean...

8025
05:42:30,260 --> 05:42:32,580
I don't know, I mean...

8026
05:42:32,580 --> 05:42:34,480
I think it's pretty important to think about.

8027
05:42:34,680 --> 05:42:35,620
That's the last one.

8028
05:42:36,020 --> 05:42:37,460
Hurry to the control room.

8029
05:42:37,740 --> 05:42:38,540
I'm on my way!

8030
05:42:39,420 --> 05:42:40,920
I'm on my way!

8031
05:42:40,960 --> 05:42:41,660
Faster, faster!

8032
05:42:41,940 --> 05:42:42,680
I'm doing it!

8033
05:42:43,060 --> 05:42:44,840
So, Naomi is a spy.

8034
05:42:45,120 --> 05:42:46,260
Just like I thought.

8035
05:42:46,260 --> 05:42:48,700
Campbell is hiding something too.

8036
05:42:48,860 --> 05:42:49,380
He is.

8037
05:42:49,660 --> 05:42:50,300
But that's okay.

8038
05:42:51,040 --> 05:42:53,760
Foxdye is a virus, a biological weapon.

8039
05:42:54,020 --> 05:42:55,680
There must be a vaccine.

8040
05:42:56,120 --> 05:42:58,500
We can worry about getting that later, Snake.

8041
05:42:58,740 --> 05:43:03,400
But right now, you've got to focus on re-inputting those detonation codes, okay?

8042
05:43:04,020 --> 05:43:05,920
Yeah, there's gotta be a...

8043
05:43:06,960 --> 05:43:09,280
There's gotta be a... a vaccine.

8044
05:43:12,540 --> 05:43:16,100
Important to note, this was originally an elevator scene for backtracking.

8045
05:43:16,100 --> 05:43:19,500
But because of skipping in Twin Snakes, they put it here.

8046
05:43:20,160 --> 05:43:21,180
Oh, yeah!

8047
05:43:24,020 --> 05:43:24,960
Yes, yes!

8048
05:43:25,860 --> 05:43:29,720
I love going in the elevator and getting all the exposition and everything.

8049
05:43:29,920 --> 05:43:30,340
It's so fun.

8050
05:43:30,760 --> 05:43:31,560
Hey, Otacon.

8051
05:43:35,780 --> 05:43:38,380
You don't even know her, Otacon.

8052
05:43:40,820 --> 05:43:42,420
You don't know her!

8053
05:43:42,760 --> 05:43:46,000
You've got to concentrate on re-inputting that detonation code.

8054
05:43:46,360 --> 05:43:46,680
Yeah.

8055
05:43:46,720 --> 05:43:47,280
You're right.

8056
05:43:47,460 --> 05:43:47,700
Yeah.

8057
05:43:47,820 --> 05:43:50,960
We've got to stop Metal Gear Rex from launching.

8058
05:43:51,200 --> 05:43:51,840
For sure.

8059
05:43:54,260 --> 05:43:54,980
What is it, Snake?

8060
05:43:55,720 --> 05:43:56,440
Good luck, Snake.

8061
05:43:56,700 --> 05:43:57,100
Thank you!

8062
05:43:57,160 --> 05:43:58,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

8063
05:43:58,000 --> 05:43:58,760
You know what?

8064
05:43:58,760 --> 05:43:59,320
We don't need to save.

8065
05:43:59,340 --> 05:43:59,580
We're fine.

8066
05:44:00,560 --> 05:44:00,980
All right.

8067
05:44:01,680 --> 05:44:02,120
Let's go.

8068
05:44:02,500 --> 05:44:04,060
Let's go stop...

8069
05:44:07,220 --> 05:44:07,760
Oh, okay.

8070
05:44:07,880 --> 05:44:07,980
Good.

8071
05:44:08,080 --> 05:44:08,800
I was like, wait a second.

8072
05:44:09,020 --> 05:44:10,180
It's purple!

8073
05:44:10,640 --> 05:44:11,120
But no.

8074
05:44:11,220 --> 05:44:11,720
It's red.

8075
05:44:11,820 --> 05:44:12,200
We're good.

8076
05:44:12,840 --> 05:44:14,580
Let's go stop Metal Gear...

8077
05:44:16,220 --> 05:44:17,100
from launching.

8078
05:44:21,220 --> 05:44:21,820
Let's go.

8079
05:44:22,960 --> 05:44:23,920
Oh, hello?

8080
05:44:25,640 --> 05:44:27,120
Snake, can you hear me?

8081
05:44:27,320 --> 05:44:28,020
It's Naomi.

8082
05:44:28,160 --> 05:44:28,980
How'd you get this number?

8083
05:44:29,000 --> 05:44:29,360
Naomi?

8084
05:44:29,760 --> 05:44:30,660
What the hell?

8085
05:44:30,760 --> 05:44:31,240
What the hell?

8086
05:44:31,240 --> 05:44:32,780
Gamble and the others are busy right now.

8087
05:44:33,100 --> 05:44:34,520
I'm on a different codec.

8088
05:44:35,620 --> 05:44:38,200
Naomi is what the Colonel says true.

8089
05:44:38,700 --> 05:44:41,400
Yes, but not everything I said was a lie.

8090
05:44:41,720 --> 05:44:42,740
Who are you?

8091
05:44:42,780 --> 05:44:43,200
Who are you?

8092
05:44:43,200 --> 05:44:43,660
I don't know anything.

8093
05:44:44,400 --> 05:44:46,320
My parents' face is my name.

8094
05:44:46,960 --> 05:44:49,280
The name and ID I have now I just bought.

8095
05:44:49,680 --> 05:44:52,700
But the reason why I study genetics, that was true.

8096
05:44:53,040 --> 05:44:54,680
Because you want to know yourself, right?

8097
05:44:54,880 --> 05:44:55,620
I want to know myself.

8098
05:44:55,740 --> 05:44:56,020
That's right.

8099
05:44:56,640 --> 05:44:58,440
I want to know where I came from.

8100
05:44:58,740 --> 05:45:00,440
My age, my race, anything.

8101
05:45:01,300 --> 05:45:01,760
Naomi.

8102
05:45:02,520 --> 05:45:02,980
Naomi.

8103
05:45:03,060 --> 05:45:05,500
I was found in Rhodesia sometime in the 80s.

8104
05:45:05,540 --> 05:45:06,920
A dirty little orphan.

8105
05:45:07,920 --> 05:45:08,380
Rhodesia?

8106
05:45:08,940 --> 05:45:10,560
What's now known as Zimbabwe?

8107
05:45:10,940 --> 05:45:11,400
Yes.

8108
05:45:12,480 --> 05:45:13,160
But you were born in Rhodesia?

8109
05:45:13,160 --> 05:45:13,180
But you were born in Rhodesia?

8110
05:45:13,180 --> 05:45:13,260
Yes.

8111
05:45:13,260 --> 05:45:14,060
You were found by who?

8112
05:45:14,900 --> 05:45:16,160
You were found by who?

8113
05:45:16,440 --> 05:45:18,200
There were lots of Indian laborers around.

8114
05:45:19,220 --> 05:45:21,380
That's probably where I got my skin color from.

8115
05:45:22,260 --> 05:45:23,820
But I'm not even sure about that.

8116
05:45:24,680 --> 05:45:27,000
Naomi, you're too worried about the past.

8117
05:45:27,180 --> 05:45:27,440
Yeah.

8118
05:45:27,540 --> 05:45:29,580
Isn't it enough to understand who you are now?

8119
05:45:29,960 --> 05:45:30,400
Yeah.

8120
05:45:30,440 --> 05:45:31,700
Understand who I am now?

8121
05:45:32,240 --> 05:45:33,180
Why should I?

8122
05:45:33,260 --> 05:45:34,980
No one else tries to understand me.

8123
05:45:35,640 --> 05:45:37,420
I was alone for so long.

8124
05:45:38,220 --> 05:45:39,760
Until I met my big brother.

8125
05:45:40,760 --> 05:45:41,500
And him.

8126
05:45:41,720 --> 05:45:42,160
Him?

8127
05:45:42,260 --> 05:45:43,160
Your big brother?

8128
05:45:43,180 --> 05:45:43,740
Yes.

8129
05:45:45,320 --> 05:45:46,360
Frank Yeager.

8130
05:45:46,540 --> 05:45:47,060
What?

8131
05:45:47,600 --> 05:45:48,420
He was...

8132
05:45:48,420 --> 05:45:49,100
He was a young soldier.

8133
05:45:49,220 --> 05:45:51,180
When he picked me up near the Zimbabwe River.

8134
05:45:51,340 --> 05:45:51,400
Yeager.

8135
05:45:51,400 --> 05:45:51,800
What is this music?

8136
05:45:52,480 --> 05:45:54,380
I was half dead from starvation.

8137
05:45:54,380 --> 05:45:55,360
Yeager meets a hunter.

8138
05:45:56,240 --> 05:45:57,120
Oh my god.

8139
05:45:57,780 --> 05:45:58,300
Yes.

8140
05:45:58,300 --> 05:45:58,560
Oh my god.

8141
05:45:58,980 --> 05:45:59,500
Revelation.

8142
05:45:59,980 --> 05:46:00,860
Frank Yeager.

8143
05:46:01,500 --> 05:46:05,400
The man who you destroyed was my brother and my only family.

8144
05:46:06,060 --> 05:46:06,540
No.

8145
05:46:07,300 --> 05:46:07,820
No.

8146
05:46:08,000 --> 05:46:08,460
Gray Fox.

8147
05:46:08,880 --> 05:46:09,700
Gray Fox.

8148
05:46:09,720 --> 05:46:11,680
We survived that hell together, Frank and I.

8149
05:46:12,380 --> 05:46:13,160
He protected us.

8150
05:46:13,180 --> 05:46:13,600
He protected me.

8151
05:46:14,160 --> 05:46:15,980
He is everything to me.

8152
05:46:16,120 --> 05:46:16,720
Oh my god.

8153
05:46:17,060 --> 05:46:19,180
The only proof I have of my existence.

8154
05:46:20,220 --> 05:46:22,200
Of my existence as an individual.

8155
05:46:22,760 --> 05:46:24,520
And he brought you back to America?

8156
05:46:25,020 --> 05:46:25,400
No.

8157
05:46:26,280 --> 05:46:29,000
I was in Mozambique when he came.

8158
05:46:29,240 --> 05:46:29,540
He.

8159
05:46:29,540 --> 05:46:29,960
Who's he?

8160
05:46:30,360 --> 05:46:32,480
No Save Endurance MGS Game Challenge.

8161
05:46:32,800 --> 05:46:33,100
Big Boss.

8162
05:46:33,100 --> 05:46:33,120
Yes.

8163
05:46:33,800 --> 05:46:34,360
Maybe.

8164
05:46:35,080 --> 05:46:37,240
He brought us to this land of freedom.

8165
05:46:37,640 --> 05:46:38,600
This America.

8166
05:46:39,060 --> 05:46:40,020
Big Boss.

8167
05:46:40,380 --> 05:46:42,760
But then he and my brother went back to continue the war.

8168
05:46:42,920 --> 05:46:43,160
Big Boss.

8169
05:46:43,980 --> 05:46:45,520
And that's when it happened.

8170
05:46:45,720 --> 05:46:46,780
When we killed him.

8171
05:46:47,020 --> 05:46:48,560
You killed my benefactor.

8172
05:46:48,900 --> 05:46:51,280
And sent my brother home a cripple.

8173
05:46:52,140 --> 05:46:54,640
I vowed revenge and joined Foxhound.

8174
05:46:54,840 --> 05:46:55,640
Oh my god.

8175
05:46:55,680 --> 05:46:57,220
I knew it was my best chance to meet you.

8176
05:46:57,680 --> 05:46:59,720
And I prayed for the day that I would.

8177
05:47:01,280 --> 05:47:03,260
So, were your prayers answered?

8178
05:47:03,540 --> 05:47:03,820
Yeah.

8179
05:47:03,820 --> 05:47:04,740
How do you feel now, huh?

8180
05:47:04,960 --> 05:47:05,200
Yes.

8181
05:47:05,800 --> 05:47:08,220
I waited two long years.

8182
05:47:08,760 --> 05:47:09,720
To kill me?

8183
05:47:10,020 --> 05:47:11,480
Is that all you cared about?

8184
05:47:11,780 --> 05:47:13,080
I mean, two years is long, but it's a long time.

8185
05:47:13,120 --> 05:47:13,140
I'm a little bit worried.

8186
05:47:13,140 --> 05:47:14,140
But it's like not that long.

8187
05:47:14,560 --> 05:47:15,360
Two years.

8188
05:47:15,780 --> 05:47:18,840
You were all I thought about for two long years.

8189
05:47:19,140 --> 05:47:19,800
Rent free.

8190
05:47:20,060 --> 05:47:20,580
For real for real.

8191
05:47:20,580 --> 05:47:21,780
I sent them twisted obsession.

8192
05:47:22,220 --> 05:47:23,340
Do you still hate me?

8193
05:47:23,540 --> 05:47:23,940
Not exactly.

8194
05:47:23,940 --> 05:47:25,360
Did they re-dub Naomi's lines?

8195
05:47:25,600 --> 05:47:27,000
They re-dubbed everybody's lines.

8196
05:47:27,140 --> 05:47:27,480
I was probably wrong about you.

8197
05:47:27,600 --> 05:47:29,140
What about Liquid and the others?

8198
05:47:30,060 --> 05:47:32,480
I'll have my revenge on them, too.

8199
05:47:32,840 --> 05:47:33,320
Yeah.

8200
05:47:33,420 --> 05:47:33,900
Naomi.

8201
05:47:34,580 --> 05:47:36,860
You didn't kill that doctor, too, did you?

8202
05:47:37,060 --> 05:47:39,660
The one that used Gray Fox for his genome experiments.

8203
05:47:40,620 --> 05:47:41,460
Dr. Clark?

8204
05:47:41,640 --> 05:47:43,120
Yeah, but they got rid of Naomi's lines.

8205
05:47:43,120 --> 05:47:43,260
Naomi's accent.

8206
05:47:43,760 --> 05:47:44,340
That was my brother.

8207
05:47:46,180 --> 05:47:48,080
Afterward, I covered it up and helped him hide out.

8208
05:47:48,080 --> 05:47:48,780
Now he's obsessed with me, Naomi.

8209
05:47:49,640 --> 05:47:52,440
So that ninja, I mean Gray Fox.

8210
05:47:52,760 --> 05:47:53,200
That ninja.

8211
05:47:53,240 --> 05:47:54,460
He's come here to kill me.

8212
05:47:55,360 --> 05:47:56,300
I don't think so.

8213
05:47:57,080 --> 05:47:58,840
I think he just came here to find you.

8214
05:47:58,920 --> 05:47:58,940
He loves you.

8215
05:47:58,940 --> 05:47:59,720
He loves you, Snake.

8216
05:48:00,220 --> 05:48:02,720
I wasn't sure before, but now I think I understand.

8217
05:48:03,940 --> 05:48:05,560
A final battle with you.

8218
05:48:06,460 --> 05:48:07,520
That's all he lives for.

8219
05:48:07,880 --> 05:48:08,920
Soldiers are so weird.

8220
05:48:10,540 --> 05:48:10,940
Fox.

8221
05:48:11,280 --> 05:48:14,400
They're all just like, I need to have, I need to have, I need to have, I need to have, I need to fight one more time.

8222
05:48:14,720 --> 05:48:15,580
Tell me something.

8223
05:48:17,040 --> 05:48:18,140
About FOXDIE.

8224
05:48:19,060 --> 05:48:23,400
FOXDIE is a type of retrovirus that targets and kills only specific people.

8225
05:48:23,680 --> 05:48:24,040
Yeah.

8226
05:48:24,360 --> 05:48:27,300
First, it infects the macrophages in the victim's body.

8227
05:48:27,860 --> 05:48:28,520
What's that?

8228
05:48:28,640 --> 05:48:32,740
FOXDIE contains smart enzymes created through protein engineering.

8229
05:48:33,020 --> 05:48:33,220
Ooh.

8230
05:48:33,460 --> 05:48:36,600
They're programmed to respond to specific genetic patterns in cells.

8231
05:48:36,940 --> 05:48:36,960
I don't...

8232
05:48:36,960 --> 05:48:37,980
I mean, I know that the...

8233
05:48:37,980 --> 05:48:39,760
Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA.

8234
05:48:39,780 --> 05:48:40,000
Right.

8235
05:48:40,000 --> 05:48:41,100
Original recordings were bad.

8236
05:48:41,500 --> 05:48:42,420
They respond by becoming cells.

8237
05:48:42,420 --> 05:48:43,080
But I don't think they stand up for themselves.

8238
05:48:45,220 --> 05:48:46,800
They have soul.

8239
05:48:47,140 --> 05:48:47,760
They have soul.

8240
05:48:47,760 --> 05:48:47,800
Thank you.

8241
05:48:47,880 --> 05:48:48,180
Thank you.

8242
05:48:48,780 --> 05:48:50,080
It's a type of cytokine.

8243
05:48:50,180 --> 05:48:50,720
Do you know Jaeger means hunter?

8244
05:48:50,920 --> 05:48:51,440
Psst.

8245
05:48:51,480 --> 05:48:52,380
No, it doesn't.

8246
05:48:53,220 --> 05:48:54,120
That's a spoiler.

8247
05:48:54,420 --> 05:49:00,780
The TNF epsilon is carried along the bloodstream to the heart, where they attach to the TNF receptors in the heart cells.

8248
05:49:00,820 --> 05:49:01,480
I can fix him.

8249
05:49:01,540 --> 05:49:03,600
And then, they cause a heart attack.

8250
05:49:03,760 --> 05:49:03,980
Yeah.

8251
05:49:04,060 --> 05:49:07,680
The heart cells suffer a shock and undergo an extreme epitosis.

8252
05:49:07,960 --> 05:49:08,820
A-apoptosis.

8253
05:49:09,260 --> 05:49:11,580
Then, the victim dies.

8254
05:49:11,960 --> 05:49:12,480
Scary.

8255
05:49:12,500 --> 05:49:13,060
A-apoptosis.

8256
05:49:17,100 --> 05:49:17,580
Naomi.

8257
05:49:18,440 --> 05:49:22,640
You must have programmed that thing to kill me too, right?

8258
05:49:22,880 --> 05:49:23,440
You did.

8259
05:49:24,960 --> 05:49:25,440
Naomi!

8260
05:49:27,680 --> 05:49:28,160
Naomi!

8261
05:49:29,460 --> 05:49:31,580
I don't blame you for wanting me dead.

8262
05:49:31,960 --> 05:49:32,440
Answer!

8263
05:49:32,620 --> 05:49:32,980
I can't go yet.

8264
05:49:33,200 --> 05:49:34,640
I still have a job to do.

8265
05:49:34,740 --> 05:49:37,080
Why can't you ever give us a clear answer, Naomi?

8266
05:49:37,080 --> 05:49:39,600
I'm not the one who made the decision to use Foxdye.

8267
05:49:39,900 --> 05:49:40,200
Huh?

8268
05:49:40,680 --> 05:49:41,680
You weren't?

8269
05:49:42,420 --> 05:49:42,640
No.

8270
05:49:42,740 --> 05:49:43,040
I'm not.

8271
05:49:43,060 --> 05:49:43,340
No.

8272
05:49:43,920 --> 05:49:46,940
You were injected with Foxdye as a part of this operation.

8273
05:49:47,840 --> 05:49:51,100
I just wanted to let you know that- No.

8274
05:49:52,740 --> 05:49:54,040
That's not the whole truth.

8275
05:49:54,460 --> 05:49:54,780
Huh?

8276
05:49:55,020 --> 05:49:57,680
The real thing I wanted to- Why are you such a pathological liar?

8277
05:49:58,140 --> 05:49:58,420
Snake.

8278
05:49:58,600 --> 05:49:59,120
Hey!

8279
05:49:59,340 --> 05:50:00,360
What are you doing?

8280
05:50:00,960 --> 05:50:01,520
No!

8281
05:50:04,480 --> 05:50:05,520
Live, Snake.

8282
05:50:05,740 --> 05:50:06,900
You must live.

8283
05:50:07,560 --> 05:50:08,120
Naomi?

8284
05:50:08,700 --> 05:50:09,260
Snake.

8285
05:50:09,520 --> 05:50:12,760
I can't allow Naomi to make any more unauthorized transmission of the virus.

8286
05:50:12,760 --> 05:50:13,040
No!

8287
05:50:13,060 --> 05:50:13,720
What?

8288
05:50:14,520 --> 05:50:16,500
Naomi's been removed from this operation.

8289
05:50:16,920 --> 05:50:18,000
What happened to Naomi?

8290
05:50:18,300 --> 05:50:21,860
What did she mean when she said that Foxdye was a part of this operation?

8291
05:50:22,320 --> 05:50:24,220
Colonel, let me talk to her.

8292
05:50:24,460 --> 05:50:25,080
I won't.

8293
05:50:25,100 --> 05:50:26,060
She's under arrest.

8294
05:50:26,060 --> 05:50:26,840
Twist after twist after twist!

8295
05:50:27,440 --> 05:50:27,980
Colonel!

8296
05:50:28,180 --> 05:50:29,260
You double-crossed me.

8297
05:50:29,600 --> 05:50:31,520
Snake, there's no time for that.

8298
05:50:31,520 --> 05:50:31,640
Colonel!

8299
05:50:32,120 --> 05:50:35,000
Right now, your job is to stop Metal Gear.

8300
05:50:35,400 --> 05:50:37,440
You'll die when you die, Naomi.

8301
05:50:38,360 --> 05:50:39,400
That's her, alright.

8302
05:50:40,940 --> 05:50:42,240
Oh my gosh.

8303
05:50:42,240 --> 05:50:42,740
Oh my gosh.

8304
05:50:42,740 --> 05:50:43,040
Oh my gosh.

8305
05:50:43,060 --> 05:50:45,080
What do you mean there's no time?

8306
05:50:45,440 --> 05:50:49,160
When I've been injected with a poison, essentially.

8307
05:50:49,640 --> 05:50:50,080
Oh my gosh.

8308
05:50:50,200 --> 05:50:54,020
The camera angles sometimes get me a little motion sick.

8309
05:50:58,720 --> 05:51:00,780
Naomi yapped a little too much.

8310
05:51:02,620 --> 05:51:03,400
Here we go.

8311
05:51:04,480 --> 05:51:05,540
Final PAL key.

8312
05:51:05,760 --> 05:51:06,840
Nice and steamy.

8313
05:51:08,560 --> 05:51:09,860
Insert we go.

8314
05:51:10,800 --> 05:51:13,040
Yeah, there's no time to talk about my double-crossing.

8315
05:51:13,060 --> 05:51:17,400
Yeah, he's just like, just get your job done before you die.

8316
05:51:17,720 --> 05:51:18,820
Which is also so sad.

8317
05:51:19,000 --> 05:51:21,380
Snake just being like, I have one friend.

8318
05:51:21,460 --> 05:51:22,260
It's the Colonel.

8319
05:51:22,640 --> 05:51:23,140
It's like...

8320
05:51:25,600 --> 05:51:28,080
Snake, you're just a tool to everybody.

8321
05:51:30,460 --> 05:51:33,400
You know, if you rearrange Rat Patrol...

8322
05:51:33,400 --> 05:51:34,440
What's that mean?

8323
05:51:34,640 --> 05:51:35,380
Oh, here we go.

8324
05:51:37,200 --> 05:51:37,980
Here it is.

8325
05:51:41,580 --> 05:51:41,980
What?

8326
05:51:42,380 --> 05:51:42,780
Oh!

8327
05:51:43,060 --> 05:51:44,860
Oh my god!

8328
05:51:45,200 --> 05:51:45,520
No!

8329
05:51:45,760 --> 05:51:46,360
Why?

8330
05:51:46,680 --> 05:51:47,040
Why?

8331
05:51:48,220 --> 05:51:48,820
No!

8332
05:51:49,360 --> 05:51:49,960
No!

8333
05:51:51,480 --> 05:51:52,080
No!

8334
05:51:53,600 --> 05:51:54,200
Welcome

8335
05:51:57,300 --> 05:51:58,040
to Membo Ship!

8336
05:51:58,180 --> 05:51:58,600
Thank you!

8337
05:51:58,900 --> 05:51:59,540
I deactivated.

8338
05:51:59,540 --> 05:52:00,100
I deactivated.

8339
05:52:00,240 --> 05:52:01,440
Oh, here it is.

8340
05:52:02,620 --> 05:52:03,500
Who's calling?

8341
05:52:03,780 --> 05:52:04,380
Master?

8342
05:52:04,680 --> 05:52:05,280
Please!

8343
05:52:05,680 --> 05:52:06,580
Thank you, Snake.

8344
05:52:07,300 --> 05:52:09,720
Now the detonation code is completed.

8345
05:52:09,940 --> 05:52:10,660
Master Miller!

8346
05:52:10,960 --> 05:52:12,860
Nothing can stop Metal Gear now.

8347
05:52:13,140 --> 05:52:13,340
No!

8348
05:52:13,480 --> 05:52:15,100
Master, what's going on?

8349
05:52:15,200 --> 05:52:15,940
Master, please.

8350
05:52:15,960 --> 05:52:16,140
You're the one who's calling.

8351
05:52:16,140 --> 05:52:19,720
You found the key and even activated the warhead for us, too.

8352
05:52:20,000 --> 05:52:22,660
I really must express my gratitude.

8353
05:52:23,260 --> 05:52:23,340
No.

8354
05:52:23,760 --> 05:52:28,140
Sorry to have involved you in that silly shape memory alloy business.

8355
05:52:28,560 --> 05:52:29,680
What are you talking about?

8356
05:52:30,040 --> 05:52:32,680
We weren't able to learn the DARPA chief's code.

8357
05:52:33,080 --> 05:52:36,780
Even with Manta's psychic powers, he couldn't read his mind.

8358
05:52:37,020 --> 05:52:40,400
Then Ocelot accidentally killed him during the interrogation.

8359
05:52:41,220 --> 05:52:41,800
No!

8360
05:52:41,800 --> 05:52:45,100
In other words, we weren't able to launch the nuclear device...

8361
05:52:45,100 --> 05:52:45,300
No!

8362
05:52:45,300 --> 05:52:47,080
...and we were all getting a little worried.

8363
05:52:47,460 --> 05:52:49,760
Without the threat of a nuclear strike...

8364
05:52:49,760 --> 05:52:50,740
We were getting a little worried.

8365
05:52:50,800 --> 05:52:51,660
...our demands would never be met.

8366
05:52:51,800 --> 05:52:52,900
Gotta launch that nuke.

8367
05:52:53,120 --> 05:52:54,400
Without the detonation codes...

8368
05:52:54,400 --> 05:52:55,240
He played us like a fiddle.

8369
05:52:55,300 --> 05:52:57,120
...we had to find some other way.

8370
05:52:57,720 --> 05:53:00,040
That's when I decided you might prove useful, Snake.

8371
05:53:00,040 --> 05:53:00,600
Oh, my God.

8372
05:53:00,700 --> 05:53:02,740
We were just a pawn in everyone's game.

8373
05:53:03,260 --> 05:53:07,940
Well, for starters, I had Decoy Octopus disguise himself as the DARPA chief.

8374
05:53:07,980 --> 05:53:08,640
Oh, my God.

8375
05:53:08,820 --> 05:53:12,160
We thought we'd get the info from you, but there was FOXDIE.

8376
05:53:12,300 --> 05:53:12,700
Yeah.

8377
05:53:13,040 --> 05:53:15,080
You mean you had this plan from the beginning?

8378
05:53:15,080 --> 05:53:17,680
Just to get me to input the detonation code?

8379
05:53:18,000 --> 05:53:18,220
Huh.

8380
05:53:18,620 --> 05:53:21,560
You didn't think you made it this far by yourself, did you?

8381
05:53:21,560 --> 05:53:23,580
Are you telling me he didn't actually regrow that arm?

8382
05:53:24,020 --> 05:53:27,280
In any case, the launch preparations are complete.

8383
05:53:27,820 --> 05:53:30,980
Once the world glimpses the power of this weapon...

8384
05:53:30,980 --> 05:53:32,540
Master, I trusted you!

8385
05:53:32,640 --> 05:53:34,220
...the White House will have no choice but to surrender the FOXDIE vaccine to me.

8386
05:53:34,220 --> 05:53:35,440
I trusted you, Master.

8387
05:53:35,740 --> 05:53:37,160
Their ace in the hole is useless now.

8388
05:53:37,160 --> 05:53:38,500
Doshite Miller-senpai.

8389
05:53:38,800 --> 05:53:40,080
Ace in the hole.

8390
05:53:40,140 --> 05:53:43,480
The Pentagon's plan to use you was already successful.

8391
05:53:44,500 --> 05:53:45,020
Doshite.

8392
05:53:45,680 --> 05:53:46,980
Ha ha ha.

8393
05:53:47,260 --> 05:53:49,760
Snake, you're the only one...

8394
05:53:49,760 --> 05:53:51,000
Master baited you.

8395
05:53:51,900 --> 05:53:53,720
I can't believe he did that.

8396
05:53:53,840 --> 05:53:54,540
Who are you anyway?

8397
05:53:55,160 --> 05:53:57,480
I'll tell you everything you want to know.

8398
05:53:57,760 --> 05:53:58,320
Wait.

8399
05:53:58,320 --> 05:54:00,020
If you come to where I am, that is.

8400
05:54:00,060 --> 05:54:02,020
Is there the little jump scare of...

8401
05:54:02,020 --> 05:54:03,060
Where are you?

8402
05:54:04,620 --> 05:54:06,140
Very close by.

8403
05:54:06,420 --> 05:54:07,920
Very close by.

8404
05:54:07,980 --> 05:54:09,920
Snake, that's not Master Miller.

8405
05:54:10,160 --> 05:54:10,520
What?

8406
05:54:10,640 --> 05:54:12,560
Campbell, you're too late.

8407
05:54:12,940 --> 05:54:13,980
Master Miller's body was just discovered by...

8408
05:54:13,980 --> 05:54:14,640
Say, psych!

8409
05:54:15,020 --> 05:54:15,420
Right now!

8410
05:54:17,560 --> 05:54:18,660
Master Muller!

8411
05:54:20,780 --> 05:54:21,760
Oh my god.

8412
05:54:22,080 --> 05:54:25,820
Why didn't you check this sooner?

8413
05:54:29,520 --> 05:54:30,140
Brother!

8414
05:54:34,820 --> 05:54:35,440
Yeah!

8415
05:54:37,660 --> 05:54:41,880
This is how everyone betrays snakes in these games.

8416
05:54:41,880 --> 05:54:42,740
Glad I never did.

8417
05:54:47,060 --> 05:54:48,720
Dramatic stare off.

8418
05:54:50,030 --> 05:54:50,580
No!

8419
05:54:53,710 --> 05:54:54,460
Oh my god.

8420
05:54:54,500 --> 05:54:54,660
No!

8421
05:54:59,100 --> 05:55:00,200
Call...

8422
05:55:00,200 --> 05:55:02,020
Colonel!

8423
05:55:03,860 --> 05:55:04,960
Snake!

8424
05:55:04,980 --> 05:55:05,540
Gas!

8425
05:55:05,920 --> 05:55:06,840
Do something!

8426
05:55:11,440 --> 05:55:12,020
Snake!

8427
05:55:12,940 --> 05:55:13,020
Call!

8428
05:55:13,890 --> 05:55:14,440
Emerick!

8429
05:55:14,660 --> 05:55:15,460
Snake!

8430
05:55:15,840 --> 05:55:16,480
Do!

8431
05:55:17,140 --> 05:55:17,700
Something!

8432
05:55:18,800 --> 05:55:19,080
Snake!

8433
05:55:29,300 --> 05:55:33,660
I hope we get the little liquid jump scare as he runs by.

8434
05:55:39,720 --> 05:55:40,840
Very close.

8435
05:55:41,000 --> 05:55:44,220
But that's why he didn't pick up when we were fighting the hindee!

8436
05:55:47,060 --> 05:55:47,320
Gas!

8437
05:55:47,860 --> 05:55:50,860
All you can do is wait for Dr. Emerick to open the door.

8438
05:55:51,140 --> 05:55:52,440
Stay alive, Snake.

8439
05:55:52,700 --> 05:55:53,360
Fox alive.

8440
05:55:54,020 --> 05:55:54,840
Fox alive.

8441
05:56:20,580 --> 05:56:22,840
If only Snake would throw up here.

8442
05:56:23,100 --> 05:56:23,600
Oh no.

8443
05:56:23,700 --> 05:56:24,260
Wait, never mind.

8444
05:56:24,320 --> 05:56:25,400
He would throw up in his mask.

8445
05:56:26,700 --> 05:56:28,100
That'd be awful, actually.

8446
05:56:29,000 --> 05:56:29,820
Um, Otacon?

8447
05:56:30,620 --> 05:56:31,480
Uh, Otacon!

8448
05:56:32,580 --> 05:56:33,440
O-Otacon.

8449
05:56:33,800 --> 05:56:34,320
Otacon.

8450
05:56:34,780 --> 05:56:35,380
Wait, Otacon.

8451
05:56:36,600 --> 05:56:37,120
Otacon.

8452
05:56:37,120 --> 05:56:37,680
O-Otacon.

8453
05:56:38,320 --> 05:56:38,960
O-Otacon!

8454
05:56:39,440 --> 05:56:40,340
O-Otacon, this is bad.

8455
05:56:40,460 --> 05:56:40,960
O-Otacon.

8456
05:56:41,020 --> 05:56:42,260
Wait, wait, wait, wait, this is actually bad.

8457
05:56:42,460 --> 05:56:43,200
Otacon, this is bad!

8458
05:56:43,940 --> 05:56:45,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my god.

8459
05:56:45,740 --> 05:56:46,300
Wait, Otacon!

8460
05:57:00,890 --> 05:57:03,590
I know the

8461
05:57:07,360 --> 05:57:09,120
gas mask doesn't do anything anymore, but Otacon!

8462
05:57:10,520 --> 05:57:11,480
Um, Otacon, please!

8463
05:57:12,900 --> 05:57:13,640
Oh, thank god.

8464
05:57:16,900 --> 05:57:17,860
Thank you.

8465
05:57:17,980 --> 05:57:19,200
Took you long enough.

8466
05:57:19,740 --> 05:57:20,260
Gosh!

8467
05:57:21,760 --> 05:57:23,120
I had to use a ration!

8468
05:57:25,200 --> 05:57:26,080
Okay, here we go.

8469
05:57:26,200 --> 05:57:26,980
I love this part.

8470
05:57:27,140 --> 05:57:27,420
Please.

8471
05:57:27,540 --> 05:57:27,880
Please.

8472
05:57:28,200 --> 05:57:28,720
Please.

8473
05:57:28,900 --> 05:57:29,420
Please.

8474
05:57:29,560 --> 05:57:29,820
Please.

8475
05:57:29,900 --> 05:57:31,880
Also, we're in for a really...

8476
05:57:31,880 --> 05:57:34,100
We're in for a treat of a cutscene coming up.

8477
05:57:34,360 --> 05:57:34,620
Okay.

8478
05:57:34,760 --> 05:57:35,280
Please.

8479
05:57:35,360 --> 05:57:35,560
Please.

8480
05:57:52,320 --> 05:57:53,360
It sucked.

8481
05:57:57,100 --> 05:57:59,500
Nick, did you like my sunglasses?

8482
05:58:00,820 --> 05:58:03,860
Oh, you'd point a weapon at your own brother?

8483
05:58:04,820 --> 05:58:06,780
Why did you disguise yourself as master?

8484
05:58:07,500 --> 05:58:10,460
So I could manipulate you more easily.

8485
05:58:10,820 --> 05:58:13,440
You performed quite well, I must say.

8486
05:58:13,660 --> 05:58:14,560
I must say.

8487
05:58:14,960 --> 05:58:19,340
Although the boys at the Pentagon are probably saying the same thing.

8488
05:58:19,760 --> 05:58:21,260
Like my sunglasses?

8489
05:58:21,740 --> 05:58:27,040
Following orders blindly with no questions asked, you've lost your warrior's pride.

8490
05:58:27,100 --> 05:58:29,700
And become nothing more than a pawn, Snake.

8491
05:58:30,040 --> 05:58:30,520
A pawn?

8492
05:58:30,820 --> 05:58:31,040
What?

8493
05:58:32,080 --> 05:58:33,600
Stopping the nuclear launch?

8494
05:58:33,920 --> 05:58:35,320
Rescuing the hostages?

8495
05:58:35,540 --> 05:58:36,900
We managed to avoid choking.

8496
05:58:37,380 --> 05:58:37,640
It was all just a diversion.

8497
05:58:38,200 --> 05:58:39,320
A diversion?

8498
05:58:39,640 --> 05:58:40,000
A diversion?

8499
05:58:40,380 --> 05:58:43,880
The Pentagon only needed you to come into contact with us.

8500
05:58:44,240 --> 05:58:47,720
That's what killed the arms tech president and decoy octopus.

8501
05:58:48,120 --> 05:58:49,780
They wanted to kill them on purpose.

8502
05:58:51,120 --> 05:58:51,920
That's right.

8503
05:58:52,640 --> 05:58:54,900
You were sent here to kill us.

8504
05:58:54,900 --> 05:58:55,020
Did you like my sunglasses?

8505
05:58:55,140 --> 05:59:00,040
So they could retrieve Metal Gear Undamaged, along with bodies of the Genome Soldiers.

8506
05:59:00,340 --> 05:59:00,680
Oh my gosh.

8507
05:59:01,000 --> 05:59:06,880
From the beginning, the Pentagon was just using you as a vector to spread Fox Dye.

8508
05:59:06,980 --> 05:59:07,540
No!

8509
05:59:08,080 --> 05:59:08,680
Fox Dye?

8510
05:59:08,960 --> 05:59:09,560
Fox Dye?

8511
05:59:09,580 --> 05:59:10,040
It can't be.

8512
05:59:10,220 --> 05:59:12,740
Are you telling me Naomi was working with the Pentagon?

8513
05:59:13,040 --> 05:59:13,520
Oh, no, no.

8514
05:59:13,800 --> 05:59:14,860
They thought she was.

8515
05:59:15,040 --> 05:59:18,960
But it seems that Dr. Naomi Hunter couldn't be controlled so easily.

8516
05:59:18,960 --> 05:59:19,620
Thank you for the raid.

8517
05:59:21,180 --> 05:59:22,040
Thank you.

8518
05:59:22,360 --> 05:59:24,420
We've got a spy working in the Pentagon.

8519
05:59:24,420 --> 05:59:30,300
He reported that Dr. Hunter altered Fox Dye's program just before the operation.

8520
05:59:30,660 --> 05:59:33,660
But no one knows how or why.

8521
05:59:34,500 --> 05:59:35,480
I wonder.

8522
05:59:35,980 --> 05:59:38,860
Maybe they arrested her so they could find out the answer to that.

8523
05:59:39,820 --> 05:59:40,780
No doubt.

8524
05:59:41,220 --> 05:59:45,640
But I had no idea she was motivated by such petty revenge.

8525
05:59:46,220 --> 05:59:49,900
We still don't know what changes she made to Fox Dye's program.

8526
05:59:51,880 --> 05:59:52,700
Oh well.

8527
05:59:52,860 --> 05:59:53,680
Doesn't matter.

8528
05:59:54,420 --> 05:59:58,680
I've already added the Fox Dye vaccine to my list of White House demands.

8529
06:00:00,120 --> 06:00:00,760
There's a vaccine?

8530
06:00:02,000 --> 06:00:03,240
There must be.

8531
06:00:03,540 --> 06:00:06,580
But that woman is the only one who really knows.

8532
06:00:06,980 --> 06:00:10,460
It might prove to be unnecessary.

8533
06:00:12,500 --> 06:00:13,780
Oh, yes!

8534
06:00:13,880 --> 06:00:14,480
Here it is!

8535
06:00:16,580 --> 06:00:21,040
You were successful in coming into contact with all of us.

8536
06:00:21,140 --> 06:00:24,180
So we must have all been exposed to the virus.

8537
06:00:24,420 --> 06:00:25,380
You're just young.

8538
06:00:26,000 --> 06:00:31,440
It's true that the arms tech president and decoy octopus were killed by Fox Dye.

8539
06:00:35,220 --> 06:00:41,440
But Ocelot, myself, and you, the carrier, were apparently unaffected.

8540
06:00:42,200 --> 06:00:42,880
Why?

8541
06:00:43,660 --> 06:00:46,000
Why is it so extra?

8542
06:00:46,320 --> 06:00:50,900
In any case, if it doesn't kill you, then I'm not worried either.

8543
06:00:51,180 --> 06:00:54,620
After all, our genetic code is identical.

8544
06:00:55,220 --> 06:00:56,060
It's so awesome!

8545
06:00:56,420 --> 06:00:57,140
So it's true.

8546
06:00:57,820 --> 06:00:59,140
You and I are...

8547
06:00:59,920 --> 06:01:00,320
Clones.

8548
06:01:01,840 --> 06:01:02,640
Oh!

8549
06:01:02,680 --> 06:01:04,220
Oh, he's breakdancing now?

8550
06:01:07,920 --> 06:01:08,720
Yes.

8551
06:01:08,720 --> 06:01:09,520
Twins.

8552
06:01:09,880 --> 06:01:10,280
Twins!

8553
06:01:10,280 --> 06:01:12,000
But we're not ordinary twins.

8554
06:01:12,380 --> 06:01:15,560
We're twins linked by cursed genes.

8555
06:01:15,960 --> 06:01:18,220
Les enfants terribles!

8556
06:01:18,340 --> 06:01:19,460
Les enfants terribles!

8557
06:01:20,080 --> 06:01:21,280
You're fine.

8558
06:01:22,200 --> 06:01:24,380
You got all the old man's dominant genes.

8559
06:01:24,700 --> 06:01:27,620
I got all the flawed, recessive genes.

8560
06:01:27,840 --> 06:01:32,220
Everything was done so that you would be the greatest of his children.

8561
06:01:32,580 --> 06:01:37,040
The only reason I exist is so they could create you.

8562
06:01:37,820 --> 06:01:41,100
So you're saying I'm the dominant one?

8563
06:01:42,260 --> 06:01:42,900
That's right.

8564
06:01:43,320 --> 06:01:47,020
I'm just the leftovers of what they used to make you.

8565
06:01:47,340 --> 06:01:53,280
Can you understand what it's like to know that you're garbage since the day you were born?

8566
06:01:53,800 --> 06:01:55,020
He's freaking out.

8567
06:01:55,520 --> 06:01:58,640
But I'm the one father chose.

8568
06:01:59,820 --> 06:02:02,520
So that's why you're so obsessed with Big Boss.

8569
06:02:02,860 --> 06:02:05,140
Some warped kind of love.

8570
06:02:05,620 --> 06:02:06,340
Ha!

8571
06:02:06,540 --> 06:02:07,180
Love?

8572
06:02:07,800 --> 06:02:08,540
It's hate.

8573
06:02:08,800 --> 06:02:11,200
His choosing me knowingly to be the inferior one.

8574
06:02:11,200 --> 06:02:12,100
Two sides of the same coin.

8575
06:02:12,460 --> 06:02:14,920
For this, I want revenge.

8576
06:02:15,680 --> 06:02:18,380
You don't even understand this.

8577
06:02:18,660 --> 06:02:21,620
You, who could kill your own real father.

8578
06:02:22,460 --> 06:02:24,840
You stole my chance for revenge.

8579
06:02:25,220 --> 06:02:27,900
Now I'll finish the work that father began.

8580
06:02:28,060 --> 06:02:29,600
Hey, that's a skill issue.

8581
06:02:29,740 --> 06:02:30,800
You had two tries.

8582
06:02:31,280 --> 06:02:33,320
You had two tries, Liquid.

8583
06:02:33,460 --> 06:02:34,300
You're just like Naomi.

8584
06:02:35,800 --> 06:02:37,720
Well, I'm not like you.

8585
06:02:42,860 --> 06:02:48,580
Unlike you, I'm proud of the destiny that is encoded into my very genes.

8586
06:02:48,600 --> 06:02:49,580
He's going full monkey.

8587
06:02:50,260 --> 06:02:50,860
Oh!

8588
06:02:50,860 --> 06:02:51,040
Oh!

8589
06:02:53,340 --> 06:02:56,200
You missed your last chance.

8590
06:02:56,380 --> 06:02:58,560
You'll regret that forever.

8591
06:03:00,600 --> 06:03:01,940
Uh-oh.

8592
06:03:03,260 --> 06:03:04,460
Uh-oh.

8593
06:03:04,980 --> 06:03:05,980
Snake!

8594
06:03:06,040 --> 06:03:06,680
Come!

8595
06:03:07,120 --> 06:03:11,610
Kneel down to this historic weapon!

8596
06:03:12,530 --> 06:03:14,970
Consider it an honor!

8597
06:03:15,170 --> 06:03:18,350
A gift from your brother!

8598
06:03:19,550 --> 06:03:24,070
Now, you shall bear witness to the demon weapon!

8599
06:03:24,330 --> 06:03:28,310
It will drag the world into the 21st century!

8600
06:03:30,290 --> 06:03:31,650
Oh, Rex!

8601
06:03:40,070 --> 06:03:41,470
Rex is huge!

8602
06:03:41,650 --> 06:03:42,570
Oh my god!

8603
06:03:45,230 --> 06:03:45,870
Oh!

8604
06:03:46,070 --> 06:03:52,160
The demonic weapon!

8605
06:03:53,520 --> 06:03:54,160
Wait!

8606
06:03:55,640 --> 06:03:57,560
Oh my gosh, I should have killed those guys.

8607
06:03:57,560 --> 06:03:58,560
They're gonna get crushed.

8608
06:04:01,280 --> 06:04:03,020
At least they'll die in their sleep.

8609
06:04:11,320 --> 06:04:13,100
The music's kind of awesome, though.

8610
06:04:18,820 --> 06:04:20,140
Kick its butt, man!

8611
06:04:20,360 --> 06:04:21,820
I'm gonna kick its butt!

8612
06:04:22,400 --> 06:04:24,380
Some kind of Metal Gear revengeance.

8613
06:04:28,220 --> 06:04:29,940
How do I stop it?

8614
06:04:30,020 --> 06:04:30,840
It's huge!

8615
06:04:31,100 --> 06:04:32,900
Oh my god, it's so big!

8616
06:04:36,600 --> 06:04:38,240
After Zanzibar, take one!

8617
06:04:38,400 --> 06:04:38,840
Action!

8618
06:04:49,590 --> 06:04:50,830
Wipe his ass!

8619
06:04:53,390 --> 06:04:54,610
Wipe his butt!

8620
06:05:01,560 --> 06:05:03,620
Oh, he's so cute!

8621
06:05:04,540 --> 06:05:05,560
Oh my god!

8622
06:05:06,710 --> 06:05:07,400
Now, roller!

8623
06:05:09,340 --> 06:05:12,260
Oh my god, it's so cool to see!

8624
06:05:12,520 --> 06:05:13,120
Oh!

8625
06:05:13,120 --> 06:05:14,260
Punch it!

8626
06:05:18,600 --> 06:05:20,140
We're all sub-characters!

8627
06:05:23,780 --> 06:05:25,340
He's so cute!

8628
06:05:27,600 --> 06:05:28,220
Huh?

8629
06:05:31,400 --> 06:05:32,020
Alright.

8630
06:05:32,580 --> 06:05:32,980
Alright.

8631
06:05:32,980 --> 06:05:34,360
Um, anyway...

8632
06:05:35,140 --> 06:05:35,760
Colonel!

8633
06:05:36,540 --> 06:05:40,490
God help us.

8634
06:05:40,670 --> 06:05:42,030
Metal Gear is moving.

8635
06:05:42,050 --> 06:05:42,350
No!

8636
06:05:42,350 --> 06:05:43,230
You help me!

8637
06:05:43,590 --> 06:05:45,790
Snake, it's all riding on you now.

8638
06:05:45,850 --> 06:05:46,510
You help me!

8639
06:05:47,030 --> 06:05:47,830
You've got to stop that thing!

8640
06:05:47,990 --> 06:05:48,770
But how?

8641
06:05:49,590 --> 06:05:52,130
You'll have to ask Dr. Emmerich, the guy who made it.

8642
06:05:52,150 --> 06:05:53,850
Gotta take out the... first the radom, right?

8643
06:05:58,170 --> 06:06:00,390
Snake, Rex's armor is impregnable.

8644
06:06:00,510 --> 06:06:03,070
You can't do any damage with the weapons you've got.

8645
06:06:03,770 --> 06:06:06,530
Rex uses the latest advances in compound armor.

8646
06:06:06,790 --> 06:06:07,730
Can you speak up, Otacon?

8647
06:06:07,790 --> 06:06:08,850
I can't hear you over the music.

8648
06:06:09,150 --> 06:06:10,190
I can't hear you over the music.

8649
06:06:10,950 --> 06:06:11,390
Huh?

8650
06:06:11,750 --> 06:06:13,330
The music!

8651
06:06:13,590 --> 06:06:15,990
Rex's pilot seat operates exactly like a VR system.

8652
06:06:15,990 --> 06:06:16,890
We got the chorus back!

8653
06:06:17,030 --> 06:06:17,310
Finally!

8654
06:06:17,310 --> 06:06:20,710
There are multiple sensors connected to a high-tech interface used for the controls.

8655
06:06:21,010 --> 06:06:24,610
It's completely self-enclosed and shut off from the outside environment.

8656
06:06:24,890 --> 06:06:26,650
He's not using his naked eyes.

8657
06:06:26,850 --> 06:06:30,530
So if you could somehow destroy the sensors...

8658
06:06:30,530 --> 06:06:30,970
The sensors?

8659
06:06:31,270 --> 06:06:33,430
Do you see that round plate on Rex's left arm?

8660
06:06:33,530 --> 06:06:33,910
Yes!

8661
06:06:34,250 --> 06:06:35,990
That thing that looks like a shield...

8662
06:06:35,990 --> 06:06:37,170
That's a radom.

8663
06:06:37,330 --> 06:06:41,430
If you can destroy that thing, it won't be able to use its electronic equipment.

8664
06:06:41,630 --> 06:06:44,210
It's so funny, because when I was putting together...

8665
06:06:44,210 --> 06:06:46,230
Try to hit that radom with a stinger missile.

8666
06:06:46,430 --> 06:06:46,730
Okay.

8667
06:06:47,310 --> 06:06:48,010
Stop it.

8668
06:06:48,090 --> 06:06:48,470
No!

8669
06:06:52,110 --> 06:06:52,590
Um...

8670
06:06:53,370 --> 06:06:53,850
Great.

8671
06:06:54,030 --> 06:06:56,910
The part that looks like a beak is where the pilot seat is.

8672
06:06:57,090 --> 06:06:59,150
In an emergency, it will open up.

8673
06:06:59,190 --> 06:07:03,970
But I knew how to put it together, because I was like, Oh, the radom is on its left shoulder.

8674
06:07:04,290 --> 06:07:06,430
But the interior is a different story.

8675
06:07:06,690 --> 06:07:07,110
Yeah?

8676
06:07:07,110 --> 06:07:07,470
I get it.

8677
06:07:07,790 --> 06:07:09,410
First, I destroy the radom.

8678
06:07:09,610 --> 06:07:11,870
That will force him to open up the pilot seat.

8679
06:07:12,170 --> 06:07:12,630
Right.

8680
06:07:12,950 --> 06:07:17,130
If you can shoot a missile into the cockpit, you'll destroy the computer controller.

8681
06:07:17,310 --> 06:07:20,370
You intentionally designed it with a weak point?

8682
06:07:20,590 --> 06:07:22,010
It's not a weak point.

8683
06:07:22,270 --> 06:07:23,550
More like a weakness.

8684
06:07:23,670 --> 06:07:24,330
A weakness.

8685
06:07:24,570 --> 06:07:27,930
People and weapons just aren't very appealing without a weakness of some kind.

8686
06:07:27,970 --> 06:07:29,350
So true, Otacon.

8687
06:07:29,670 --> 06:07:30,230
I guess so.

8688
06:07:30,690 --> 06:07:31,870
I owe you one, Otacon.

8689
06:07:31,910 --> 06:07:34,710
I mean, you can't make something entirely perfect, right?

8690
06:07:35,090 --> 06:07:36,530
You can't make something perfect.

8691
06:07:38,350 --> 06:07:38,830
Um...

8692
06:07:40,070 --> 06:07:43,590
Any bettakers on how many tries it will take her to beat the Zanzibar Shuffle?

8693
06:07:44,230 --> 06:07:44,710
Stop!

8694
06:07:45,270 --> 06:07:45,750
Stop!

8695
06:07:49,010 --> 06:07:49,370
Stop!

8696
06:07:49,570 --> 06:07:50,450
Okay, let's see.

8697
06:07:51,550 --> 06:07:52,230
Oh my god.

8698
06:07:53,510 --> 06:07:56,050
The music is so awesome, but it is also so loud.

8699
06:07:56,390 --> 06:07:57,370
Alright, stinger missile.

8700
06:07:58,130 --> 06:07:58,850
Oh, uh...

8701
06:07:58,850 --> 06:08:00,350
Turn around and look at him.

8702
06:08:00,650 --> 06:08:02,010
Oh wait, also...

8703
06:08:03,950 --> 06:08:05,970
I think here I can use the chaff grenades.

8704
06:08:08,830 --> 06:08:09,290
Oh god.

8705
06:08:14,220 --> 06:08:16,080
Yeah, you don't know where I am now, dummy.

8706
06:08:17,930 --> 06:08:20,170
So, lock onto that.

8707
06:08:20,410 --> 06:08:20,930
And boom.

8708
06:08:21,910 --> 06:08:22,970
And boom.

8709
06:08:32,100 --> 06:08:33,440
Chaff away!

8710
06:08:34,300 --> 06:08:34,840
And

8711
06:08:41,290 --> 06:08:41,650
uh...

8712
06:08:41,650 --> 06:08:42,110
stinger?

8713
06:08:43,150 --> 06:09:07,760
I didn't have my...

8714
06:09:08,660 --> 06:09:09,860
rations on.

8715
06:09:12,420 --> 06:09:15,120
I didn't have...

8716
06:09:16,960 --> 06:09:19,360
Oh, everything was so right.

8717
06:09:19,540 --> 06:09:20,420
Except...

8718
06:09:21,200 --> 06:09:23,000
Except... oh my god.

8719
06:09:23,940 --> 06:09:25,200
Okay, it's fine.

8720
06:09:31,060 --> 06:09:31,580
Ah!

8721
06:09:33,320 --> 06:09:33,840
Ah!

8722
06:09:34,360 --> 06:09:34,520
Ah!

8723
06:09:35,280 --> 06:09:36,040
Oh my god.

8724
06:09:36,120 --> 06:09:36,480
Uh oh.

8725
06:09:36,560 --> 06:09:37,080
Uh oh.

8726
06:09:51,020 --> 06:09:53,500
I need to throw the chaff as soon as I can.

8727
06:09:55,860 --> 06:09:56,600
Oh my goodness.

8728
06:09:57,380 --> 06:10:01,220
Ah, crunch.

8729
06:10:01,720 --> 06:10:03,080
I got crunched for real.

8730
06:10:04,560 --> 06:10:06,080
Oh, I don't think that hit.

8731
06:10:06,680 --> 06:10:06,840
Oh, I don't think that hit.

8732
06:10:07,340 --> 06:10:09,480
It's not even like...

8733
06:10:10,200 --> 06:10:11,200
It's not even like...

8734
06:10:12,620 --> 06:10:13,140
Oh!

8735
06:10:15,940 --> 06:10:16,360
Chaff!

8736
06:10:21,300 --> 06:10:21,720
Chaff!

8737
06:10:24,900 --> 06:10:26,000
That's not coming for me, right?

8738
06:10:26,520 --> 06:10:27,680
Yeah, you don't know where I am.

8739
06:10:28,400 --> 06:10:28,820
Haha.

8740
06:10:29,260 --> 06:10:30,440
You can't see me, dummy!

8741
06:10:37,400 --> 06:10:38,740
After Xanthabar, take two!

8742
06:10:39,060 --> 06:10:39,640
Hey, hey, hey!

8743
06:10:40,800 --> 06:10:42,980
It is my fault that I forgot the...

8744
06:10:42,980 --> 06:10:44,660
It is my fault I forgot the...

8745
06:10:45,400 --> 06:10:46,460
the rations, yeah.

8746
06:10:48,660 --> 06:10:49,480
It's my fault.

8747
06:10:49,480 --> 06:10:50,100
It's my fault.

8748
06:10:50,180 --> 06:10:50,740
I should have noticed.

8749
06:10:51,460 --> 06:10:52,620
Here he comes.

8750
06:11:00,870 --> 06:11:01,230
Damn!

8751
06:11:01,470 --> 06:11:02,010
Damn!

8752
06:11:06,160 --> 06:11:07,660
Oh, he's so cute!

8753
06:11:08,520 --> 06:11:10,040
Nice try, Snake!

8754
06:11:13,880 --> 06:11:17,300
Snake, stop standing there!

8755
06:11:17,860 --> 06:11:18,580
Oh!

8756
06:11:19,540 --> 06:11:20,220
Oh!

8757
06:11:21,660 --> 06:11:22,340
Oh!

8758
06:11:22,380 --> 06:11:23,460
Oh my god!

8759
06:11:24,340 --> 06:11:24,880
Gray Fox!

8760
06:11:25,680 --> 06:11:26,060
Oh!

8761
06:11:26,240 --> 06:11:26,620
Oh!

8762
06:11:28,300 --> 06:11:30,120
This is so Raiden.

8763
06:11:30,540 --> 06:11:30,660
Hahaha.

8764
06:11:31,240 --> 06:11:33,640
A name from long ago.

8765
06:11:33,900 --> 06:11:35,860
It sounds better than Deep Throat.

8766
06:11:36,260 --> 06:11:37,540
So it is you.

8767
06:11:37,840 --> 06:11:39,640
You look terrible, Snake.

8768
06:11:40,400 --> 06:11:41,860
You haven't aged well.

8769
06:11:42,340 --> 06:11:44,400
It's because I'm a clone.

8770
06:11:44,720 --> 06:11:46,320
And I age fast.

8771
06:11:46,720 --> 06:11:47,640
And I age fast.

8772
06:11:48,580 --> 06:11:52,500
And I age fast.

8773
06:11:52,500 --> 06:11:53,820
Deep Throat was...

8774
06:11:53,820 --> 06:11:55,360
was Gray Fox?

8775
06:11:57,980 --> 06:11:59,100
He was Gray...

8776
06:11:59,100 --> 06:12:00,460
He was Deep Throat the whole time!

8777
06:12:02,000 --> 06:12:03,780
Gray Fox was Deep Throating me!

8778
06:12:04,440 --> 06:12:05,920
Sorry, calling me as Deep Throat!

8779
06:12:10,740 --> 06:12:11,260
Nice.

8780
06:12:19,940 --> 06:12:20,980
Fox, why?

8781
06:12:21,500 --> 06:12:22,840
What do you want from me?

8782
06:12:24,920 --> 06:12:26,140
Fox, why?

8783
06:12:26,140 --> 06:12:26,520
What do you want from me?

8784
06:12:26,520 --> 06:12:28,880
Only you can free me.

8785
06:12:29,020 --> 06:12:29,140
Ninja!

8786
06:12:29,420 --> 06:12:31,140
Fox, stay out of this.

8787
06:12:31,400 --> 06:12:32,380
What about Naomi?

8788
06:12:32,740 --> 06:12:34,860
She's hell-bent on taking revenge for you.

8789
06:12:35,040 --> 06:12:35,860
Oh, my chat just broke.

8790
06:12:37,440 --> 06:12:37,920
Naomi...

8791
06:12:38,440 --> 06:12:38,680
Naomi...

8792
06:12:38,680 --> 06:12:40,320
You're the only one who can stop her.

8793
06:12:42,100 --> 06:12:43,900
No, I can't.

8794
06:12:44,940 --> 06:12:45,420
Why?

8795
06:12:46,840 --> 06:12:49,400
Because I'm the one who killed her parents.

8796
06:12:50,720 --> 06:12:51,680
Because I'm the one who killed her parents.

8797
06:12:51,680 --> 06:12:52,080
Oh my god.

8798
06:12:52,080 --> 06:12:53,320
I was young then.

8799
06:12:53,320 --> 06:12:57,000
And couldn't bring myself to kill her, too.

8800
06:12:57,340 --> 06:12:58,760
Oh, I think you two broke it.

8801
06:12:58,800 --> 06:12:59,400
Uh-oh.

8802
06:12:59,460 --> 06:13:02,460
I felt so bad that I decided to take her with me.

8803
06:13:03,140 --> 06:13:05,740
I raised her like she was my own blood.

8804
06:13:05,880 --> 06:13:07,340
Sorry, I'll have no chat for a minute.

8805
06:13:07,440 --> 06:13:08,640
To soothe my guilty conscience.

8806
06:13:08,740 --> 06:13:09,120
To read.

8807
06:13:09,780 --> 06:13:13,340
Even now, she thinks of me as her brother.

8808
06:13:14,260 --> 06:13:14,760
Aww.

8809
06:13:14,860 --> 06:13:15,340
Fox?

8810
06:13:16,720 --> 06:13:20,440
Outwardly, we may have seemed like contented brother and sister.

8811
06:13:21,200 --> 06:13:21,860
But you...

8812
06:13:21,860 --> 06:13:22,240
But you...

8813
06:13:23,320 --> 06:13:24,540
I looked into her eyes.

8814
06:13:24,640 --> 06:13:26,540
I trembled with fear.

8815
06:13:26,840 --> 06:13:27,100
We're back.

8816
06:13:29,600 --> 06:13:30,940
Tell her for me.

8817
06:13:31,660 --> 06:13:34,340
Tell her that I was the one who did it.

8818
06:13:34,380 --> 06:13:34,620
No!

8819
06:13:36,380 --> 06:13:37,760
There you are!

8820
06:13:38,300 --> 06:13:38,560
No!

8821
06:13:43,180 --> 06:13:44,740
We're just about out of time.

8822
06:13:45,320 --> 06:13:47,600
Here's a final present from Deep Throat.

8823
06:13:48,340 --> 06:13:49,800
I'll stop it from moving.

8824
06:13:52,220 --> 06:13:52,740
Fox!

8825
06:13:55,540 --> 06:13:57,120
What kind of present is this?

8826
06:14:08,720 --> 06:14:09,360
What kind of present is this?

8827
06:14:09,360 --> 06:14:10,220
Oh my god, so awesome.

8828
06:14:10,500 --> 06:14:11,500
Oh yeah!

8829
06:14:11,720 --> 06:14:12,800
You dodged those missiles!

8830
06:14:13,540 --> 06:14:14,180
Yeah!

8831
06:14:16,000 --> 06:14:16,640
Okay.

8832
06:14:17,300 --> 06:14:19,360
This isn't gonna stop it from shooting again.

8833
06:14:21,160 --> 06:14:24,840
Oh my god.

8834
06:14:40,380 --> 06:14:41,020
Fox!

8835
06:14:41,860 --> 06:14:42,500
Ugh.

8836
06:14:46,820 --> 06:14:47,880
Oh my god, Fox.

8837
06:14:47,980 --> 06:14:49,120
He doesn't look so good.

8838
06:14:49,200 --> 06:14:50,480
Oh no, he doesn't look so good.

8839
06:14:54,900 --> 06:14:56,020
Oh my god.

8840
06:14:56,240 --> 06:14:57,080
Oh my god.

8841
06:14:57,360 --> 06:15:00,320
In the Middle East, we don't hunt foxes.

8842
06:15:00,420 --> 06:15:02,060
We hunt jackals.

8843
06:15:02,120 --> 06:15:02,960
Oh, it looks so brutal.

8844
06:15:03,120 --> 06:15:04,100
I mean, it is brutal.

8845
06:15:04,260 --> 06:15:04,920
But oh my god.

8846
06:15:05,080 --> 06:15:06,180
We use royal harriers.

8847
06:15:07,120 --> 06:15:07,560
Fox!

8848
06:15:08,520 --> 06:15:11,800
How strong is that exoskeleton of yours?

8849
06:15:13,180 --> 06:15:13,760
Snake!

8850
06:15:14,240 --> 06:15:17,720
Are you just going to sit by and watch him die?

8851
06:15:18,320 --> 06:15:18,880
Snake!

8852
06:15:22,700 --> 06:15:23,540
He's so awesome.

8853
06:15:23,780 --> 06:15:24,800
He's so awesome.

8854
06:15:31,600 --> 06:15:34,560
Cornered Fox is more dangerous than a jackal!

8855
06:15:34,900 --> 06:15:35,100
Cornered Fox is more dangerous than a jackal!

8856
06:15:35,220 --> 06:15:35,800
Yeah!

8857
06:15:42,890 --> 06:15:45,630
He had that the whole time and just never used it.

8858
06:15:48,130 --> 06:15:49,030
It's our turn.

8859
06:15:49,770 --> 06:15:50,610
Oh god.

8860
06:15:50,610 --> 06:15:51,410
Wait a second.

8861
06:15:54,490 --> 06:15:55,170
Wait.

8862
06:15:55,170 --> 06:15:55,850
Wait.

8863
06:15:56,010 --> 06:15:57,270
He destroyed the ray dome.

8864
06:16:08,880 --> 06:16:09,560
Impressive.

8865
06:16:09,900 --> 06:16:13,220
You are indeed worthy of the code name Fox.

8866
06:16:13,600 --> 06:16:15,820
But now, you're finished!

8867
06:16:18,680 --> 06:16:20,580
Now, fire the stinger!

8868
06:16:20,840 --> 06:16:21,380
Fox!

8869
06:16:22,000 --> 06:16:24,060
Can you really shoot?

8870
06:16:24,060 --> 06:16:25,940
You'll kill him too!

8871
06:16:26,440 --> 06:16:27,860
I can't do it.

8872
06:16:28,240 --> 06:16:29,960
No, I can't do it.

8873
06:16:33,880 --> 06:16:36,020
I can finally die.

8874
06:16:39,360 --> 06:16:40,380
After Zanzibar.

8875
06:16:40,960 --> 06:16:41,700
Zanzibar land?

8876
06:16:41,980 --> 06:16:43,360
Taken from the battle.

8877
06:16:43,760 --> 06:16:45,360
Neither truly alive.

8878
06:16:45,920 --> 06:16:47,640
Nor truly dead.

8879
06:16:48,440 --> 06:16:49,620
It's no good.

8880
06:16:49,860 --> 06:16:50,920
I can't do it.

8881
06:16:51,840 --> 06:16:52,500
It's no good.

8882
06:16:52,760 --> 06:16:54,040
I can't do it.

8883
06:16:54,060 --> 06:16:55,060
It's no good.

8884
06:16:55,380 --> 06:16:56,880
After Zanzibar land.

8885
06:16:58,160 --> 06:16:59,300
They changed it.

8886
06:17:07,380 --> 06:17:09,240
They changed it to Zanzibar land.

8887
06:17:09,660 --> 06:17:10,120
Oh no.

8888
06:17:10,300 --> 06:17:11,760
I don't think I can watch this.

8889
06:17:11,920 --> 06:17:12,240
Oh my god.

8890
06:17:12,640 --> 06:17:13,440
No, no, no.

8891
06:17:13,760 --> 06:17:14,240
Oh!

8892
06:17:16,460 --> 06:17:17,220
Oh my god.

8893
06:17:18,180 --> 06:17:18,660
Huh?

8894
06:17:25,390 --> 06:17:25,870
Snake.

8895
06:17:26,930 --> 06:17:28,790
We're not tools of the government.

8896
06:17:28,930 --> 06:17:30,270
Or anyone else.

8897
06:17:31,970 --> 06:17:33,970
Fighting was the only thing.

8898
06:17:33,970 --> 06:17:37,050
The only thing I was good at.

8899
06:17:37,210 --> 06:17:37,970
The only thing I was good at.

8900
06:17:37,970 --> 06:17:39,010
But at least...

8901
06:17:39,010 --> 06:17:43,570
I always fought for what I believed in.

8902
06:17:44,070 --> 06:17:46,890
I always fought for what I believed in.

8903
06:17:46,890 --> 06:17:47,590
Snake.

8904
06:17:51,230 --> 06:17:51,930
Farewell.

8905
06:17:52,130 --> 06:17:52,550
Farewell.

8906
06:17:56,480 --> 06:17:57,820
Oh god.

8907
06:17:58,440 --> 06:17:59,140
Oh

8908
06:18:03,290 --> 06:18:04,310
god.

8909
06:18:04,450 --> 06:18:04,970
Oh my god.

8910
06:18:05,130 --> 06:18:06,330
When death is entreated.

8911
06:18:07,750 --> 06:18:09,090
He just like...

8912
06:18:09,090 --> 06:18:10,370
Oh my god.

8913
06:18:10,370 --> 06:18:11,010
He just smooshed him.

8914
06:18:11,010 --> 06:18:11,990
The battle is decided.

8915
06:18:14,590 --> 06:18:15,830
Good lord.

8916
06:18:21,840 --> 06:18:23,440
You see?

8917
06:18:23,600 --> 06:18:25,600
You can't protect anyone.

8918
06:18:26,960 --> 06:18:28,520
Not even yourself.

8919
06:18:39,200 --> 06:18:41,320
We changed the teleprompter.

8920
06:18:44,580 --> 06:18:45,820
Just chuck it at him.

8921
06:18:46,160 --> 06:18:47,320
Maybe you'll get lucky.

8922
06:18:51,270 --> 06:18:51,790
Nice.

8923
06:18:57,780 --> 06:18:58,300
Why?

8924
06:18:58,400 --> 06:18:59,800
Why are you running at him?

8925
06:19:00,460 --> 06:19:01,380
Okay, everybody.

8926
06:19:03,180 --> 06:19:04,400
Wait, I cannot...

8927
06:19:05,860 --> 06:19:07,580
I cannot see where you are.

8928
06:19:07,740 --> 06:19:10,780
I do want to see if I can find some more.

8929
06:19:11,820 --> 06:19:12,860
I do want to see if I can find some more.

8930
06:19:12,860 --> 06:19:13,400
Oh my god.

8931
06:19:14,000 --> 06:19:15,480
Did I get hit?

8932
06:19:15,880 --> 06:19:16,920
I think I got hit.

8933
06:19:16,940 --> 06:19:17,280
Okay, good.

8934
06:19:17,340 --> 06:19:18,200
There's a ration right here.

8935
06:19:19,900 --> 06:19:21,420
I do want to find some more.

8936
06:19:23,520 --> 06:19:24,480
That was sneaky.

8937
06:19:24,660 --> 06:19:25,840
It unequipped my...

8938
06:19:25,840 --> 06:19:28,540
It unequipped my rations.

8939
06:19:31,100 --> 06:19:32,180
It unequipped them.

8940
06:19:32,420 --> 06:19:33,540
Oh wait.

8941
06:19:45,100 --> 06:19:46,740
Can I stinger him from here?

8942
06:19:47,500 --> 06:19:47,940
Here?

8943
06:19:48,080 --> 06:19:48,400
There?

8944
06:19:48,460 --> 06:19:48,820
There.

8945
06:20:01,600 --> 06:20:02,820
What are you doing?

8946
06:20:03,340 --> 06:20:04,120
Oh my god.

8947
06:20:08,120 --> 06:20:09,560
Oh my god.

8948
06:20:09,700 --> 06:20:10,180
There?

8949
06:20:13,520 --> 06:20:15,640
Why are you just yelling?

8950
06:20:20,080 --> 06:20:20,440
That

8951
06:20:28,620 --> 06:20:29,580
should be me.

8952
06:20:30,400 --> 06:20:31,440
Right there.

8953
06:20:31,520 --> 06:20:32,700
Right there, please.

8954
06:20:36,240 --> 06:20:36,780
Oh my god.

8955
06:20:37,840 --> 06:20:39,580
Did that hit?

8956
06:20:39,780 --> 06:20:40,520
I don't know actually.

8957
06:20:45,360 --> 06:20:46,680
I don't think it did.

8958
06:20:47,280 --> 06:20:48,320
I don't think it hit.

8959
06:20:48,480 --> 06:20:49,000
That's okay though.

8960
06:20:50,400 --> 06:20:52,980
It's kind of...

8961
06:20:58,580 --> 06:20:59,580
Next one!

8962
06:21:10,900 --> 06:21:12,240
Can I get him again?

8963
06:21:17,270 --> 06:21:18,270
Oh shoot.

8964
06:21:23,020 --> 06:21:23,800
Run, Snake!

8965
06:21:23,860 --> 06:21:24,260
Run!

8966
06:21:25,160 --> 06:21:25,960
Run, Snake!

8967
06:21:25,960 --> 06:21:26,020
Run, Snake!

8968
06:21:26,020 --> 06:21:26,300
Run, Snake!

8969
06:21:40,870 --> 06:21:43,250
I'll crush you into dust!

8970
06:21:50,110 --> 06:21:52,050
To end dusted.

8971
06:21:52,370 --> 06:21:52,510
To end dusted.

8972
06:21:56,090 --> 06:21:58,150
It is truly that this game is easier.

8973
06:21:58,590 --> 06:22:01,470
It is just truly that this game is easier than...

8974
06:22:01,470 --> 06:22:07,930
It is just truly that this game is easier than...

8975
06:22:07,930 --> 06:22:11,650
It is just the fact that this game is easier.

8976
06:22:12,010 --> 06:22:12,610
But...

8977
06:22:16,450 --> 06:22:16,930
Aaaaah!

8978
06:22:17,450 --> 06:22:19,030
Yeah, it's less janky.

8979
06:22:20,290 --> 06:22:21,190
I knew it.

8980
06:22:21,230 --> 06:22:22,230
That was nothing for you.

8981
06:22:23,810 --> 06:22:25,150
It really looked easy.

8982
06:22:25,170 --> 06:22:25,890
It's so much easier.

8983
06:22:26,170 --> 06:22:26,790
It's so...

8984
06:22:28,390 --> 06:22:28,870
It's so much easier.

8985
06:22:28,870 --> 06:22:29,550
It's so much easier.

8986
06:22:32,150 --> 06:22:32,630
Uh...

8987
06:22:32,630 --> 06:22:33,950
What do you mean, as usual?

8988
06:22:36,270 --> 06:22:36,910
Do you know me?

8989
06:22:37,290 --> 06:22:40,990
This guy has nine lives.

8990
06:22:41,290 --> 06:22:41,350
This guy has nine lives.

8991
06:22:42,610 --> 06:22:44,210
Okay, now I think this is the real fight.

8992
06:22:46,790 --> 06:22:49,530
This is the more difficult part, I'd say.

8993
06:22:52,090 --> 06:22:53,090
Keeps people waiting.

8994
06:22:55,550 --> 06:22:58,110
Snake, have you heard of Big Chungus?

8995
06:23:03,190 --> 06:23:05,370
Yeah, Meryl is dead in this one.

8996
06:23:12,610 --> 06:23:14,250
Well-needed men like us.

8997
06:23:16,750 --> 06:23:18,310
We were valued then.

8998
06:23:18,570 --> 06:23:20,370
We were desired.

8999
06:23:20,890 --> 06:23:22,990
You don't have to just be a weapon, though, man.

9000
06:23:23,130 --> 06:23:24,310
You can just live your life.

9001
06:23:24,430 --> 06:23:25,830
Get a hobby.

9002
06:23:26,150 --> 06:23:31,830
With all the liars and hypocrites running the world, war isn't what it used to be.

9003
06:23:33,110 --> 06:23:37,550
We're losing our place in a world that no longer needs us.

9004
06:23:37,810 --> 06:23:39,130
A world that now spurns our very existence.

9005
06:23:39,130 --> 06:23:41,630
Yeah, I wanted to get the ending with Otacon, so...

9006
06:23:41,630 --> 06:23:42,590
You should die.

9007
06:23:43,470 --> 06:23:46,170
There's one specific part that is so funny.

9008
06:23:46,370 --> 06:23:53,850
After I launch this weapon and get our billion dollars, we'll be able to bring chaos and honor back to this world gone soft.

9009
06:23:55,330 --> 06:24:02,870
Conflict shall breed conflict, new hatreds will arise, and our own biosphere shall steadily expand.

9010
06:24:03,410 --> 06:24:07,770
But as long as there are people, there will always be war.

9011
06:24:09,730 --> 06:24:12,430
But the problem is balance.

9012
06:24:12,430 --> 06:24:15,730
Father knew what type of a balance was best.

9013
06:24:15,970 --> 06:24:17,670
Is that the only reason?

9014
06:24:18,710 --> 06:24:22,290
Isn't that reason enough for warriors such as us?

9015
06:24:23,250 --> 06:24:25,230
I don't want that kind of world.

9016
06:24:25,510 --> 06:24:25,930
Ha!

9017
06:24:26,190 --> 06:24:27,430
You lie.

9018
06:24:27,810 --> 06:24:28,550
Is it because I...

9019
06:24:28,550 --> 06:24:29,950
So why are you here, then?

9020
06:24:30,010 --> 06:24:31,110
Is it because I enjoy all the killing?

9021
06:24:31,290 --> 06:24:35,570
Why do you continue to follow your orders while your superiors betray you?

9022
06:24:35,970 --> 06:24:37,790
Why did you come here?

9023
06:24:38,230 --> 06:24:38,750
Why?

9024
06:24:38,850 --> 06:24:40,510
Well, I'll tell you then.

9025
06:24:40,530 --> 06:24:40,730
No.

9026
06:24:41,610 --> 06:24:43,230
Oh, here, I love this part.

9027
06:24:44,630 --> 06:24:47,150
You enjoy all the killing.

9028
06:24:47,350 --> 06:24:48,210
That's why.

9029
06:24:48,790 --> 06:24:49,430
What?

9030
06:24:49,950 --> 06:24:51,890
Are you denying it?

9031
06:24:52,070 --> 06:24:55,010
Haven't you already killed most of my comrades?

9032
06:24:55,430 --> 06:24:58,430
The mocap actor is so great.

9033
06:24:58,850 --> 06:25:00,250
The hand flare.

9034
06:25:00,290 --> 06:25:04,110
I watched your face as you delivered the coup de grace.

9035
06:25:05,330 --> 06:25:05,970
No, you didn't.

9036
06:25:06,090 --> 06:25:08,870
Oh, it reflected such vitality.

9037
06:25:09,350 --> 06:25:09,990
Yes.

9038
06:25:10,730 --> 06:25:10,990
Why did you strip me?

9039
06:25:10,990 --> 06:25:11,270
You're wrong.

9040
06:25:11,750 --> 06:25:14,710
Why did you strip me, Liquid?

9041
06:25:15,110 --> 06:25:15,390
There is a killer inside you.

9042
06:25:15,450 --> 06:25:17,370
You don't have to deny it.

9043
06:25:17,370 --> 06:25:18,470
Why did you take off my shirt?

9044
06:25:18,950 --> 06:25:20,170
We were created to be that way.

9045
06:25:21,670 --> 06:25:22,230
Created...

9046
06:25:22,230 --> 06:25:23,230
Created...

9047
06:25:26,070 --> 06:25:26,850
Terrible children...

9048
06:25:26,850 --> 06:25:28,350
The terrible children.

9049
06:25:30,790 --> 06:25:32,070
The terrible children?

9050
06:25:32,070 --> 06:25:32,690
Terrible children… Terrible children…

9051
06:25:42,330 --> 06:25:46,190
I never understood why... Snake wakes up with his clothes off.

9052
06:25:46,330 --> 06:25:47,550
I know, it's so weird.

9053
06:25:49,110 --> 06:25:50,110
Big boss!

9054
06:25:57,110 --> 06:25:58,050
Let's put that.

9055
06:26:11,470 --> 06:26:14,810
They fertilized an egg with one of father's cells.

9056
06:26:15,390 --> 06:26:19,050
And then, let it divide into eight clone babies.

9057
06:26:19,570 --> 06:26:21,290
I ate the other babies.

9058
06:26:21,290 --> 06:26:23,370
Then they transferred the clones to someone's uterus.

9059
06:26:23,530 --> 06:26:29,850
And later intentionally aborted six of the fetuses to encourage strong fetal growth.

9060
06:26:30,250 --> 06:26:31,030
I don't... that's...

9061
06:26:31,030 --> 06:26:34,350
You and I were originally octuplets.

9062
06:26:35,290 --> 06:26:36,010
Octuplets?

9063
06:26:36,010 --> 06:26:36,930
We could have had more.

9064
06:26:37,330 --> 06:26:40,450
The other six of our brothers were sacrificed.

9065
06:26:40,730 --> 06:26:41,870
To make us.

9066
06:26:41,890 --> 06:26:43,650
We could have had gassy snake.

9067
06:26:44,470 --> 06:26:45,630
Oh, gassy snake.

9068
06:26:46,790 --> 06:26:48,110
Oh my god.

9069
06:26:48,490 --> 06:26:50,810
So, it was you and I.

9070
06:26:51,110 --> 06:26:55,110
Two fertilized eggs with exactly the same DNA.

9071
06:26:55,710 --> 06:26:58,370
But, they weren't finished yet.

9072
06:26:58,870 --> 06:27:01,630
They used me as a guinea pig.

9073
06:27:01,830 --> 06:27:06,410
To create a phenotype in which all of the dominant genes were expressed.

9074
06:27:06,690 --> 06:27:08,610
To create... you.

9075
06:27:09,410 --> 06:27:10,630
I got all the risks.

9076
06:27:12,010 --> 06:27:13,610
You're too obsessed with the genes.

9077
06:27:13,990 --> 06:27:16,010
You took everything from me before I was even born.

9078
06:27:16,150 --> 06:27:17,450
We're too obsessed with the genes.

9079
06:27:18,730 --> 06:27:22,310
But, you and I aren't his only children.

9080
06:27:22,630 --> 06:27:23,290
Oh no.

9081
06:27:23,430 --> 06:27:23,590
What?

9082
06:27:23,970 --> 06:27:25,510
The genome soldiers.

9083
06:27:26,030 --> 06:27:28,270
They too are his progeny.

9084
06:27:28,570 --> 06:27:30,830
Carrying on his genetic legacy.

9085
06:27:31,330 --> 06:27:34,810
But unlike us, they carry it digitally.

9086
06:27:35,790 --> 06:27:36,670
Oh my god.

9087
06:27:36,710 --> 06:27:39,990
With the completion of the human genome project in the last century.

9088
06:27:39,990 --> 06:27:43,450
The mysteries of humanity were laid bare.

9089
06:27:44,590 --> 06:27:46,490
Thanks to father's DNA.

9090
06:27:46,710 --> 06:27:51,150
They were able to identify more than 60 soldier genes.

9091
06:27:51,390 --> 06:27:57,670
Responsible for everything from strategic thinking to the proverbial killer instinct.

9092
06:27:57,930 --> 06:28:02,950
Those soldier genes were transplanted using gene therapy.

9093
06:28:03,150 --> 06:28:06,890
Into the members of the next generation special forces.

9094
06:28:07,290 --> 06:28:09,970
That's how they became the genes.

9095
06:28:09,970 --> 06:28:10,630
The genome soldiers.

9096
06:28:10,670 --> 06:28:13,890
I know a little bit about the story of acid 1 and 2.

9097
06:28:14,030 --> 06:28:14,810
That's right.

9098
06:28:15,490 --> 06:28:19,530
The genome soldiers that you've been killing right and left.

9099
06:28:19,670 --> 06:28:20,170
And it's wild.

9100
06:28:20,170 --> 06:28:23,650
Are our brothers with the same genes as ours.

9101
06:28:23,990 --> 06:28:25,350
The genome soldiers.

9102
06:28:25,890 --> 06:28:26,850
The genome soldiers.

9103
06:28:27,790 --> 06:28:29,890
They are misshapen creatures.

9104
06:28:30,350 --> 06:28:32,870
When he grins or shows teeth he reminds me of Willem Dafoe.

9105
06:28:33,670 --> 06:28:35,870
They are our blood brothers.

9106
06:28:36,150 --> 06:28:38,950
And they were born of many an ultimate sacrifice.

9107
06:28:39,750 --> 06:28:41,470
Good thing Solid Snake doesn't smile.

9108
06:28:48,100 --> 06:28:49,840
Why is he looking at me like that?

9109
06:28:50,840 --> 06:28:51,560
1991.

9110
06:28:52,400 --> 06:28:53,860
The Gulf War.

9111
06:28:54,400 --> 06:28:58,820
The military secretly injected soldiers with the soldier genes.

9112
06:28:59,380 --> 06:29:00,260
Real footage.

9113
06:29:00,280 --> 06:29:00,340
Real footage.

9114
06:29:00,600 --> 06:29:05,160
The Gulf War syndrome that hundreds of thousands of returning soldiers complained about.

9115
06:29:05,220 --> 06:29:05,740
Real people.

9116
06:29:05,740 --> 06:29:07,240
Was a side effect of it.

9117
06:29:07,780 --> 06:29:08,540
Ha.

9118
06:29:09,100 --> 06:29:09,860
Flesh.

9119
06:29:09,860 --> 06:29:10,540
Flesh.

9120
06:29:10,660 --> 06:29:10,760
Flesh being.

9121
06:29:10,760 --> 06:29:13,440
Everyone knows that the Gulf War syndrome was caused by exposure to pesticides.

9122
06:29:13,540 --> 06:29:16,460
And radiation from depleted uranium rounds.

9123
06:29:17,060 --> 06:29:17,820
Ha.

9124
06:29:18,280 --> 06:29:19,040
Idiot.

9125
06:29:19,180 --> 06:29:21,220
That was just a cover story.

9126
06:29:21,580 --> 06:29:23,200
Issued by the Pentagon.

9127
06:29:24,100 --> 06:29:28,280
First they tried to say it was post-traumatic stress disorder.

9128
06:29:28,560 --> 06:29:31,360
Then chemical or biological weapons.

9129
06:29:31,820 --> 06:29:34,400
The poison gas detection units.

9130
06:29:34,400 --> 06:29:36,600
And the anti-serine injections.

9131
06:29:37,040 --> 06:29:40,520
They were all just to cover up the secret genetic experiments.

9132
06:29:40,780 --> 06:29:40,880
Oh.

9133
06:29:40,880 --> 06:29:41,540
They were just crazy.

9134
06:29:41,720 --> 06:29:42,120
They were just.

9135
06:29:42,140 --> 06:29:42,980
They were just.

9136
06:29:43,020 --> 06:29:43,860
Getting the genes.

9137
06:29:44,280 --> 06:29:47,640
The so-called Gulf War babies that have been reported by Gulf War veterans are.

9138
06:29:48,260 --> 06:29:48,900
Yes.

9139
06:29:49,760 --> 06:29:53,360
They too are our brothers and sisters.

9140
06:29:53,760 --> 06:29:54,340
I cut Ken Blossom in the battlefield.

9141
06:29:55,420 --> 06:29:56,060
Absolutely.

9142
06:29:56,080 --> 06:29:59,240
So the genome soldiers mean that the experiments were a success?

9143
06:30:00,280 --> 06:30:00,920
Success?

9144
06:30:01,380 --> 06:30:02,620
Don't be a fool.

9145
06:30:02,960 --> 06:30:04,380
They're a complete failure.

9146
06:30:05,460 --> 06:30:07,520
We're on the verge of extinction.

9147
06:30:07,960 --> 06:30:08,360
What?

9148
06:30:08,600 --> 06:30:11,620
Have you ever heard of the asymmetry theory?

9149
06:30:14,160 --> 06:30:16,960
Nature tends to favor asymmetry.

9150
06:30:17,140 --> 06:30:21,820
Those species which have gone extinct all show signs of symmetry.

9151
06:30:22,260 --> 06:30:25,400
The genome soldiers suffer from the same problem.

9152
06:30:25,540 --> 06:30:25,900
Isn't this not real?

9153
06:30:26,060 --> 06:30:27,000
Signs of symmetry.

9154
06:30:27,400 --> 06:30:28,560
So do I.

9155
06:30:28,740 --> 06:30:29,040
Oh.

9156
06:30:29,220 --> 06:30:30,140
As do you.

9157
06:30:32,220 --> 06:30:33,480
Isn't this not real?

9158
06:30:33,480 --> 06:30:34,060
That's right.

9159
06:30:34,380 --> 06:30:37,800
We are all on the verge of death at the genetic level.

9160
06:30:38,140 --> 06:30:38,840
Oh my god.

9161
06:30:39,080 --> 06:30:42,340
We don't know when or what type of disease will occur.

9162
06:30:43,020 --> 06:30:44,700
A lot of this is outdated there.

9163
06:30:44,700 --> 06:30:46,100
That's why we need the old man's genetic information.

9164
06:30:47,180 --> 06:30:51,500
You want Big Boss's DNA so you can save your family?

9165
06:30:52,140 --> 06:30:53,440
Save your family?

9166
06:30:53,880 --> 06:30:54,380
What?

9167
06:30:54,540 --> 06:30:58,440
In nature, family members don't mate with each other.

9168
06:30:58,560 --> 06:31:00,760
And yet they help each other to survive.

9169
06:31:01,020 --> 06:31:02,180
Do you know why?

9170
06:31:04,560 --> 06:31:05,320
Why?

9171
06:31:05,660 --> 06:31:11,680
Because it increases the chances that shared genes will be transmitted to future generations.

9172
06:31:12,540 --> 06:31:16,820
Altruism among blood relatives is a response to natural selection.

9173
06:31:17,260 --> 06:31:23,140
That we will help our blood relatives is inscribed in our very genes.

9174
06:31:23,460 --> 06:31:24,000
In our genes.

9175
06:31:24,480 --> 06:31:29,480
You're telling me that your genes are ordering you to save the genome soldiers?

9176
06:31:29,800 --> 06:31:30,780
Thanks, Ransom.

9177
06:31:30,880 --> 06:31:31,560
Ransom.

9178
06:31:31,720 --> 06:31:32,460
She can't fight your genes.

9179
06:31:32,900 --> 06:31:34,140
It's fake.

9180
06:31:34,760 --> 06:31:40,200
All living things are born for the sole purpose of passing on their parents' genes.

9181
06:31:40,460 --> 06:31:40,940
Oh my god.

9182
06:31:41,020 --> 06:31:41,220
Whoa, whoa.

9183
06:31:41,220 --> 06:31:44,080
That's why I will follow what my genes tell me.

9184
06:31:45,160 --> 06:31:51,880
And then I'm going to go beyond in order to break the curse of my heritage.

9185
06:31:52,740 --> 06:31:54,880
He doesn't have as much cake as Snake does.

9186
06:31:54,960 --> 06:31:59,580
And to do that, first, I will kill you.

9187
06:31:59,940 --> 06:32:01,260
You had every opportunity.

9188
06:32:01,900 --> 06:32:03,740
You have had every...

9189
06:32:14,960 --> 06:32:16,260
She's on the verge of She looks like...

9190
06:32:16,260 --> 06:32:17,560
Oh there's the bomb!

9191
06:32:18,080 --> 06:32:19,220
Is she alive?

9192
06:32:21,200 --> 06:32:22,080
I'm not sure.

9193
06:32:22,640 --> 06:32:23,700
She was alive.

9194
06:32:24,080 --> 06:32:25,900
A few hours ago.

9195
06:32:26,660 --> 06:32:29,700
Poor girl kept calling your name.

9196
06:32:30,700 --> 06:32:31,460
Synth genes.

9197
06:32:31,460 --> 06:32:31,840
Meryl.

9198
06:32:31,860 --> 06:32:32,620
Meryl.

9199
06:32:32,700 --> 06:32:33,520
Stupid woman.

9200
06:32:33,920 --> 06:32:35,480
Falling in love with a man who looks like a baby.

9201
06:32:36,320 --> 06:32:37,620
I have a name.

9202
06:32:38,240 --> 06:32:38,940
Yeah!

9203
06:32:50,480 --> 06:32:52,080
Let Meryl go.

9204
06:33:02,740 --> 06:33:05,240
Not all dominant genes are good.

9205
06:33:05,500 --> 06:33:06,140
Hmm...

9206
06:33:08,700 --> 06:33:12,480
Yeah, it's just... it's uh...

9207
06:33:13,740 --> 06:33:14,920
Historical fiction.

9208
06:33:16,080 --> 06:33:17,160
Science fiction.

9209
06:33:17,440 --> 06:33:18,360
And historical fiction.

9210
06:33:19,220 --> 06:33:19,980
Which is always fun.

9211
06:33:20,680 --> 06:33:21,460
Uh-oh.

9212
06:33:22,840 --> 06:33:25,460
Uh, Colonel, you have some explaining to do.

9213
06:33:35,500 --> 06:33:36,140
What for?

9214
06:33:36,500 --> 06:33:37,800
To bomb the place.

9215
06:33:37,800 --> 06:33:38,780
Yeah, shut it, Eli.

9216
06:33:39,920 --> 06:33:43,580
B-2 bombers just lifted off from Galena Air Force Base.

9217
06:33:43,740 --> 06:33:43,880
Uh-oh.

9218
06:33:43,880 --> 06:33:44,120
Uh -oh.

9219
06:33:44,120 --> 06:33:48,740
They're carrying B-61-13 surface-piercing tactical nuclear bombs.

9220
06:33:49,000 --> 06:33:49,360
Uh-oh.

9221
06:33:49,380 --> 06:33:49,560
What?

9222
06:33:49,920 --> 06:33:51,580
Metal Gear is destroyed.

9223
06:33:51,940 --> 06:33:53,760
Tell the Secretary of Defense.

9224
06:33:54,240 --> 06:33:54,820
Uh-oh.

9225
06:33:54,820 --> 06:33:59,420
The Secretary of Defense heard that Naomi double-crossed us, and he's worried about Fox die.

9226
06:34:00,260 --> 06:34:07,400
Now that there's no more danger of a nuclear strike from Metal Gear, he's going to do whatever's necessary to cover up the truth of what really happened here.

9227
06:34:08,000 --> 06:34:13,500
He's going to drop a nuclear bomb to vaporize all the evidence, along with anyone who knows anything.

9228
06:34:13,840 --> 06:34:14,280
Ah!

9229
06:34:14,380 --> 06:34:14,920
Don't worry, Snake.

9230
06:34:15,220 --> 06:34:16,560
I'll stop the nuclear strike.

9231
06:34:16,560 --> 06:34:17,060
I don't know anything!

9232
06:34:17,280 --> 06:34:17,860
I promise!

9233
06:34:18,780 --> 06:34:23,120
I may be only a figurehead here, but I'm still officially in command of this mission.

9234
06:34:23,260 --> 06:34:24,080
Uh, for now.

9235
06:34:24,280 --> 06:34:29,040
And if I use you in order to delay the strike, it'll confuse the chain of command and at least buy you some time.

9236
06:34:29,420 --> 06:34:29,860
For now, Colonel.

9237
06:34:29,860 --> 06:34:31,200
It'll give you a chance to escape.

9238
06:34:31,360 --> 06:34:31,640
Yeah.

9239
06:34:31,640 --> 06:34:33,840
But Colonel, if you do that...

9240
06:34:33,840 --> 06:34:35,000
It's okay, Snake.

9241
06:34:35,480 --> 06:34:39,360
The truth is, Foxhound was already the subject of an undercover investigation.

9242
06:34:40,060 --> 06:34:45,080
Meryl was transferred to this base just before the terrorist attack as a way of manipulating me.

9243
06:34:46,000 --> 06:34:47,120
Those bastards!

9244
06:34:47,680 --> 06:34:48,480
Those bastards!

9245
06:34:48,480 --> 06:34:48,840
I'm sorry.

9246
06:34:49,280 --> 06:34:52,080
They forced me to cooperate in exchange for her life.

9247
06:34:53,040 --> 06:34:54,640
He's gonna punch the nukes.

9248
06:34:54,660 --> 06:34:54,680
You'd better get out of there, Snake.

9249
06:34:54,820 --> 06:34:55,920
Are you sure?

9250
06:34:56,680 --> 06:34:58,060
It'll be bad for you.

9251
06:34:58,380 --> 06:34:59,200
Don't worry.

9252
06:34:59,840 --> 06:35:02,280
It's the least I can do for you after all the lies.

9253
06:35:02,760 --> 06:35:03,240
Colonel.

9254
06:35:03,900 --> 06:35:06,020
I'm ordering them to cancel the bombing run.

9255
06:35:06,520 --> 06:35:08,160
After that, there's no turning back.

9256
06:35:08,660 --> 06:35:08,820
Huh?

9257
06:35:09,360 --> 06:35:10,360
What are you doing?

9258
06:35:10,620 --> 06:35:11,420
Uh-oh.

9259
06:35:12,680 --> 06:35:13,160
Snake!

9260
06:35:13,680 --> 06:35:15,780
Mei Ling, what happened to the Colonel?

9261
06:35:16,040 --> 06:35:17,060
I don't believe it!

9262
06:35:17,260 --> 06:35:18,140
What happened?

9263
06:35:18,220 --> 06:35:18,680
What's happening?

9264
06:35:18,900 --> 06:35:19,580
The Colonel!

9265
06:35:20,160 --> 06:35:20,700
Sit, speak!

9266
06:35:20,840 --> 06:35:23,420
Roy Campbell has been relieved of duty.

9267
06:35:23,780 --> 06:35:25,200
I always forget about this guy.

9268
06:35:25,340 --> 06:35:26,780
This is the Secretary of Defense, Jim Housman.

9269
06:35:26,780 --> 06:35:27,780
Jim Housman, yes.

9270
06:35:27,780 --> 06:35:28,740
Bring the Colonel back on.

9271
06:35:29,020 --> 06:35:30,940
He's been placed under arrest.

9272
06:35:31,300 --> 06:35:31,460
Jim Hate.

9273
06:35:31,460 --> 06:35:31,500
Boo!

9274
06:35:31,620 --> 06:35:35,800
For leaking top secret information and for the crime of high treason.

9275
06:35:35,800 --> 06:35:36,520
Boo, Jim!

9276
06:35:36,600 --> 06:35:37,020
Ridiculous.

9277
06:35:37,020 --> 06:35:37,420
Boo!

9278
06:35:37,560 --> 06:35:40,140
This isn't what you promised me, Jim!

9279
06:35:40,340 --> 06:35:40,760
Yes, he is a ridiculous man.

9280
06:35:40,900 --> 06:35:42,280
This is not what you promised me!

9281
06:35:42,780 --> 06:35:44,620
He truly believed that he was in command of this operation.

9282
06:35:44,660 --> 06:35:46,800
You can't see, but I'm like pretending I'm whacking him with my cane.

9283
06:35:47,860 --> 06:35:51,500
There won't be a speck of evidence left.

9284
06:35:52,160 --> 06:35:55,220
I'm sure the President would want the same thing.

9285
06:35:55,540 --> 06:35:57,320
The President ordered this?

9286
06:35:57,380 --> 06:35:57,760
The President ordered this?

9287
06:35:57,780 --> 06:35:59,960
The President is a busy man.

9288
06:36:00,180 --> 06:36:00,480
The President is a busy man.

9289
06:36:00,480 --> 06:36:02,380
I have complete authority here.

9290
06:36:02,840 --> 06:36:07,240
How do you plan on explaining the nuclear attack on Alaska to the media?

9291
06:36:07,540 --> 06:36:08,260
Second favorite character after Bliskin.

9292
06:36:08,260 --> 06:36:08,760
Don't worry.

9293
06:36:09,660 --> 06:36:12,720
We've prepared a convincing cover story.

9294
06:36:13,160 --> 06:36:17,860
We'll simply say that the terrorists exploded a nuclear device.

9295
06:36:18,100 --> 06:36:18,560
Oh my God.

9296
06:36:18,600 --> 06:36:18,900
Damn it.

9297
06:36:19,140 --> 06:36:21,000
You'll be murdering everyone here.

9298
06:36:21,220 --> 06:36:22,220
The scientists.

9299
06:36:22,440 --> 06:36:23,500
The genome army.

9300
06:36:23,700 --> 06:36:24,320
Everyone.

9301
06:36:24,840 --> 06:36:25,560
Donald.

9302
06:36:25,720 --> 06:36:27,420
The DARPA chief.

9303
06:36:27,420 --> 06:36:27,760
Donald.

9304
06:36:27,760 --> 06:36:29,020
And the DARPA chief is already dead.

9305
06:36:29,320 --> 06:36:29,680
Nah.

9306
06:36:29,900 --> 06:36:33,260
So you didn't mean to kill the DARPA chief after all.

9307
06:36:33,440 --> 06:36:33,700
Ahhh.

9308
06:36:33,780 --> 06:36:34,780
He was my friend.

9309
06:36:35,060 --> 06:36:38,300
And you could care less about what happens to everybody else, huh?

9310
06:36:38,620 --> 06:36:41,140
Well, if you give me the optic disc.

9311
06:36:41,140 --> 06:36:43,020
If only, if only the other guy...

9312
06:36:43,020 --> 06:36:44,880
I might consider saving them.

9313
06:36:44,960 --> 06:36:45,420
Had a...

9314
06:36:45,420 --> 06:36:46,340
What are you talking about?

9315
06:36:47,020 --> 06:36:48,680
Metal Gear's test data.

9316
06:36:49,160 --> 06:36:50,680
Donald was supposed to bring it back.

9317
06:36:50,700 --> 06:36:51,220
Had a...

9318
06:36:51,220 --> 06:36:51,860
I don't have it.

9319
06:36:51,860 --> 06:36:53,220
Accidentally got killed by Ocelot.

9320
06:36:53,400 --> 06:36:53,880
I see.

9321
06:36:55,000 --> 06:36:55,880
Oh well.

9322
06:36:56,600 --> 06:36:57,340
That's okay.

9323
06:36:57,460 --> 06:36:57,740
We brought you.

9324
06:36:57,740 --> 06:36:57,900
Baker.

9325
06:36:58,400 --> 06:36:59,280
Oh, wow.

9326
06:37:08,940 --> 06:37:10,360
He's still a person!

9327
06:37:28,360 --> 06:37:32,140
Let's finish this before the airstrike.

9328
06:37:35,350 --> 06:37:38,280
You stole everything from me.

9329
06:37:38,640 --> 06:37:40,580
Got my Naruto gloves on.

9330
06:37:41,820 --> 06:37:44,080
I even have my Naruto headband.

9331
06:37:46,600 --> 06:37:47,900
Sexy no jutsu!

9332
06:37:48,940 --> 06:37:50,620
Oh no!

9333
06:37:52,940 --> 06:37:54,260
Nothing changed!

9334
06:37:54,660 --> 06:37:55,980
I'm already sexy.

9335
06:37:59,760 --> 06:38:01,860
Do you see this?

9336
06:38:03,210 --> 06:38:06,600
This will be the time limit for our final battle.

9337
06:38:07,460 --> 06:38:14,580
When death comes for this girl, this nuclear module shall vanish from this world as well.

9338
06:38:14,840 --> 06:38:17,880
If you win, you might still be able to save her.

9339
06:38:17,880 --> 06:38:19,420
Is he gonna talk over the timer again?

9340
06:38:19,580 --> 06:38:20,280
Like before?

9341
06:38:20,760 --> 06:38:24,320
You could enjoy one brief moment of love.

9342
06:38:24,380 --> 06:38:25,200
Of love!

9343
06:38:29,500 --> 06:38:32,000
Let's get this over with.

9344
06:38:33,340 --> 06:38:33,980
Yeah!

9345
06:38:34,360 --> 06:38:35,580
Oh, wow!

9346
06:38:36,180 --> 06:38:39,660
Here we go, everybody!

9347
06:38:40,180 --> 06:38:43,420
And if you cross this line, you'll fall.

9348
06:38:44,280 --> 06:38:47,080
At this height, it'll kill even you.

9349
06:38:48,160 --> 06:38:49,780
What about you then, huh?

9350
06:38:51,400 --> 06:38:53,400
Oh my god, not him fixing his hair.

9351
06:38:58,300 --> 06:38:59,480
Oh my god, not him fixing his hair.

9352
06:39:00,600 --> 06:39:01,280
Down.

9353
06:39:01,480 --> 06:39:02,500
Have at you, Snake!

9354
06:39:04,020 --> 06:39:04,700
Yeah!

9355
06:39:13,400 --> 06:39:16,640
Oh, he doesn't talk during... Stop running away!

9356
06:39:17,100 --> 06:39:17,560
Oh my god.

9357
06:39:17,560 --> 06:39:18,140
Oh shoot.

9358
06:39:21,180 --> 06:39:21,860
Stop!

9359
06:39:21,860 --> 06:39:24,520
God, you are so annoying!

9360
06:39:25,100 --> 06:39:25,680
Oh my god!

9361
06:39:25,880 --> 06:39:27,500
Uh... uh...

9362
06:39:29,340 --> 06:39:30,160
Oh my god.

9363
06:39:30,340 --> 06:39:30,520
Oh my god.

9364
06:39:31,240 --> 06:39:32,500
I still have the dog tags.

9365
06:39:36,440 --> 06:39:36,960
Um...

9366
06:39:39,480 --> 06:39:40,520
Stop running!

9367
06:39:42,640 --> 06:39:44,200
What's wrong, Snake?

9368
06:39:46,240 --> 06:39:47,180
Better hurry!

9369
06:39:47,380 --> 06:39:48,660
It's going to blow!

9370
06:39:50,100 --> 06:39:51,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9371
06:39:51,360 --> 06:39:52,000
That's right.

9372
06:39:53,220 --> 06:39:54,100
You come here.

9373
06:39:55,060 --> 06:39:56,700
What's wrong, Snake?

9374
06:39:58,260 --> 06:39:58,740
Ah!

9375
06:39:59,500 --> 06:40:00,480
Yeah, that's right.

9376
06:40:03,260 --> 06:40:04,180
Better hurry!

9377
06:40:04,320 --> 06:40:05,640
It's going to blow!

9378
06:40:06,000 --> 06:40:06,840
It's going to blow!

9379
06:40:10,080 --> 06:40:11,480
What's wrong, Snake?

9380
06:40:13,360 --> 06:40:13,960
Come here.

9381
06:40:14,420 --> 06:40:15,260
Better hurry!

9382
06:40:20,450 --> 06:40:21,250
Oh my god.

9383
06:40:21,490 --> 06:40:23,390
I don't think I'm gonna make this.

9384
06:40:23,870 --> 06:40:25,590
I don't think I'm gonna make this at all.

9385
06:40:26,070 --> 06:40:27,630
What's wrong, Snake?

9386
06:40:28,350 --> 06:40:29,290
Stop running!

9387
06:40:30,310 --> 06:40:31,330
Yeah, that's right.

9388
06:40:31,330 --> 06:40:31,430
That's right.

9389
06:40:31,630 --> 06:40:32,210
That's right.

9390
06:40:32,470 --> 06:40:33,730
I'm gonna crush your little hand.

9391
06:40:33,830 --> 06:40:34,370
Oh, nevermind.

9392
06:40:35,890 --> 06:40:37,310
I got his dog tags!

9393
06:40:39,810 --> 06:40:40,290
Ouch!

9394
06:40:46,620 --> 06:40:48,840
Oh my god, he hits so much harder than me!

9395
06:40:55,180 --> 06:40:55,660
Ouch!

9396
06:40:55,980 --> 06:40:56,600
Oh my god.

9397
06:40:56,700 --> 06:40:57,300
Uh oh.

9398
06:41:00,460 --> 06:41:01,400
Better hurry!

9399
06:41:01,640 --> 06:41:02,920
It's going to blow!

9400
06:41:03,300 --> 06:41:03,820
Don't come at me.

9401
06:41:10,710 --> 06:41:11,970
Oh, this is not good.

9402
06:41:13,730 --> 06:41:14,770
This is not good.

9403
06:41:15,470 --> 06:41:16,950
What's wrong, Snake?

9404
06:41:18,170 --> 06:41:19,030
Um, wait.

9405
06:41:19,170 --> 06:41:19,430
Oh.

9406
06:41:21,390 --> 06:41:22,650
The recessive dreams.

9407
06:41:23,490 --> 06:41:25,070
It's the recessive dreams.

9408
06:41:26,970 --> 06:41:27,970
Better hurry!

9409
06:41:28,150 --> 06:41:29,450
It's going to blow!

9410
06:41:35,190 --> 06:41:35,750
Ouch!

9411
06:41:37,650 --> 06:41:38,510
Yeah, that's right.

9412
06:41:40,990 --> 06:41:41,770
Oh, shoot.

9413
06:42:01,020 --> 06:42:01,900
I'm gonna die.

9414
06:42:01,980 --> 06:42:02,300
Better hurry!

9415
06:42:02,420 --> 06:42:03,560
It's going to blow!

9416
06:42:03,560 --> 06:42:04,380
We're so done.

9417
06:42:04,620 --> 06:42:04,780
We're...

9418
06:42:04,780 --> 06:42:05,280
This is...

9419
06:42:05,280 --> 06:42:06,420
It's so over.

9420
06:42:08,140 --> 06:42:09,140
It's so over.

9421
06:42:09,640 --> 06:42:10,580
It's so over.

9422
06:42:21,620 --> 06:42:23,260
Not him laughing at me!

9423
06:42:24,580 --> 06:42:25,840
It's going to blow!

9424
06:42:27,780 --> 06:42:29,180
Hey, you didn't get me either.

9425
06:42:29,360 --> 06:42:30,660
So, uh, you know...

9426
06:42:30,660 --> 06:42:32,080
What's wrong, Snake?

9427
06:42:35,660 --> 06:42:36,300
That's right.

9428
06:42:36,640 --> 06:42:37,320
Did I get...

9429
06:42:37,320 --> 06:42:38,540
Did I get his dog tags again?

9430
06:42:38,580 --> 06:42:38,840
Still?

9431
06:42:38,900 --> 06:42:39,280
Or...

9432
06:42:40,160 --> 06:42:40,680
Yeah.

9433
06:42:40,800 --> 06:42:41,120
Yeah.

9434
06:42:41,120 --> 06:42:41,380
Yeah.

9435
06:42:41,380 --> 06:42:41,820
Yeah.

9436
06:42:43,040 --> 06:42:43,480
I'm going to...

9437
06:42:43,480 --> 06:42:44,680
Gotta be like a little bit more...

9438
06:42:45,640 --> 06:42:46,920
A little bit more aggressive.

9439
06:42:49,560 --> 06:42:50,540
Oh, ah, shoot.

9440
06:42:57,320 --> 06:42:58,420
What's wrong, Snake?

9441
06:42:59,340 --> 06:43:00,220
Better hurry!

9442
06:43:00,340 --> 06:43:00,460
Oh, shoot.

9443
06:43:00,720 --> 06:43:01,160
Oh!

9444
06:43:01,260 --> 06:43:01,600
Oh!

9445
06:43:04,360 --> 06:43:05,420
I counter-kicked.

9446
06:43:08,480 --> 06:43:10,580
I don't know if I still got his dog tags or not.

9447
06:43:11,640 --> 06:43:13,920
The camera change is so confusing.

9448
06:43:13,920 --> 06:43:14,220
I don't know.

9449
06:43:14,220 --> 06:43:15,040
It's just...

9450
06:43:15,040 --> 06:43:16,140
Is that all you've got?

9451
06:43:18,080 --> 06:43:19,320
Oh, oh, oh!

9452
06:43:20,460 --> 06:43:21,220
Oh, oh, oh!

9453
06:43:21,220 --> 06:43:21,380
Oh my god.

9454
06:43:22,740 --> 06:43:24,480
Oh, that was totally on purpose.

9455
06:43:25,500 --> 06:43:26,200
Oh my god.

9456
06:43:27,700 --> 06:43:28,180
Ew!

9457
06:43:29,120 --> 06:43:29,600
Stop!

9458
06:43:33,010 --> 06:43:33,970
Stop being such a...

9459
06:43:34,690 --> 06:43:35,370
Oh my god.

9460
06:43:35,450 --> 06:43:36,150
Oh, oh.

9461
06:43:36,630 --> 06:43:37,110
Ouch!

9462
06:43:37,270 --> 06:43:37,870
Oh, ouch.

9463
06:43:39,490 --> 06:43:40,170
Oh my god.

9464
06:43:40,230 --> 06:43:40,510
Stop.

9465
06:43:43,290 --> 06:43:43,890
Owww-ji!

9466
06:43:44,170 --> 06:43:44,830
Better hurry!

9467
06:43:45,090 --> 06:43:46,410
It's going to blow!

9468
06:43:46,470 --> 06:43:46,510
Oh, oh, oh!

9469
06:43:46,510 --> 06:43:46,530
Oh, oh, oh!

9470
06:43:46,550 --> 06:43:46,950
Oh, shoot.

9471
06:43:49,850 --> 06:43:50,510
Oh my god.

9472
06:43:50,570 --> 06:43:50,910
Stop!

9473
06:43:51,010 --> 06:43:51,230
Out!

9474
06:43:53,940 --> 06:43:55,400
We're like running into each other.

9475
06:44:04,440 --> 06:44:04,880
Nice.

9476
06:44:09,260 --> 06:44:09,700
Nice.

9477
06:44:16,400 --> 06:44:17,580
Oh, no, no, no!

9478
06:44:17,660 --> 06:44:18,480
No, no, no, no, no.

9479
06:44:31,470 --> 06:44:32,970
You get off my butt!

9480
06:44:52,080 --> 06:44:52,800
Oh, shoot.

9481
06:44:52,800 --> 06:44:55,500
I don't know why I tried to... it was like...

9482
06:44:55,500 --> 06:44:56,540
Oh, no, no, no!

9483
06:45:06,670 --> 06:45:07,270
Dang.

9484
06:45:11,230 --> 06:45:12,710
That was so close!

9485
06:45:12,990 --> 06:45:14,210
That was so close!

9486
06:45:21,570 --> 06:45:22,990
Yeah, little... little...

9487
06:45:22,990 --> 06:45:26,430
I hope I still get his...

9488
06:45:26,430 --> 06:45:27,230
Oh my...

9489
06:45:27,790 --> 06:45:29,890
I hope I still got his dog tag, though.

9490
06:45:36,350 --> 06:45:36,790
Oh.

9491
06:45:37,010 --> 06:45:37,690
Oh, nice.

9492
06:45:38,370 --> 06:45:39,870
I still ended up kicking him.

9493
06:45:40,410 --> 06:45:41,290
Oh, no!

9494
06:45:42,290 --> 06:45:43,190
Not the counter!

9495
06:45:51,620 --> 06:45:52,440
Oh my god.

9496
06:45:52,580 --> 06:45:53,580
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

9497
06:45:56,800 --> 06:45:58,020
Stop being so slippery!

9498
06:46:02,580 --> 06:46:03,520
Oh my god.

9499
06:46:03,600 --> 06:46:05,360
Why was I doing so well last time?

9500
06:46:06,240 --> 06:46:08,480
This time, I can't hit... get a single hit in.

9501
06:46:33,270 --> 06:46:34,330
I'm just gonna redo it.

9502
06:46:34,430 --> 06:46:35,210
I'm just gonna redo it.

9503
06:46:35,270 --> 06:46:36,090
I'm just gonna redo it.

9504
06:46:37,550 --> 06:46:38,070
Oh, wait.

9505
06:46:38,090 --> 06:46:38,750
Can he not get me?

9506
06:46:39,010 --> 06:46:39,750
Look at him go.

9507
06:46:42,090 --> 06:46:42,890
Oh, shoot.

9508
06:46:43,370 --> 06:46:44,850
He stepped on me.

9509
06:46:50,370 --> 06:46:51,890
He's spam-charging.

9510
06:46:51,990 --> 06:46:52,910
Yeah, it's not fair!

9511
06:46:54,330 --> 06:46:55,670
It's not fair!

9512
06:46:58,770 --> 06:47:00,010
Oh my gosh.

9513
06:47:00,230 --> 06:47:02,110
That was so funny.

9514
06:47:05,970 --> 06:47:08,310
Okay, but you need to stop running all around.

9515
06:47:08,850 --> 06:47:09,310
You know?

9516
06:47:12,410 --> 06:47:13,870
I gotta kinda like fake him.

9517
06:47:14,610 --> 06:47:15,210
You know?

9518
06:47:15,290 --> 06:47:16,250
Like that and...

9519
06:47:16,250 --> 06:47:16,470
Oh.

9520
06:47:20,730 --> 06:47:21,390
There we go.

9521
06:47:22,330 --> 06:47:23,390
Kinda gotta fake him.

9522
06:47:23,870 --> 06:47:24,990
And then...

9523
06:47:24,990 --> 06:47:25,670
Oh.

9524
06:47:27,490 --> 06:47:29,250
Fake, fake, fake out.

9525
06:47:29,670 --> 06:47:31,250
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

9526
06:47:32,450 --> 06:47:33,370
Uh, sure.

9527
06:47:33,650 --> 06:47:34,110
Yeah.

9528
06:47:34,530 --> 06:47:34,990
And...

9529
06:47:35,890 --> 06:47:36,350
Yeah.

9530
06:47:37,250 --> 06:47:38,430
I'm gonna step on your hands!

9531
06:47:38,910 --> 06:47:39,710
Oh, never mind.

9532
06:47:40,970 --> 06:47:42,690
Okay, I think I do have the dog tags then.

9533
06:47:42,770 --> 06:47:43,550
Because they didn't show up.

9534
06:47:44,790 --> 06:47:45,710
Oh, shoot.

9535
06:47:46,710 --> 06:47:47,170
Fake.

9536
06:47:50,050 --> 06:47:50,410
Okay.

9537
06:47:50,770 --> 06:47:51,130
Okay.

9538
06:47:51,130 --> 06:47:51,550
Get up here!

9539
06:47:56,240 --> 06:47:56,960
Oh, shoot.

9540
06:47:57,160 --> 06:47:57,520
Oh!

9541
06:47:57,800 --> 06:47:58,540
Nice, nice, nice.

9542
06:47:58,700 --> 06:48:00,240
At least I got the kick in.

9543
06:48:04,180 --> 06:48:05,140
I think if you...

9544
06:48:05,140 --> 06:48:06,520
Oh, no.

9545
06:48:07,180 --> 06:48:09,240
I think if you get him into this corner...

9546
06:48:09,240 --> 06:48:09,480
Oh.

9547
06:48:09,940 --> 06:48:13,400
You can like kind of cheese it a little bit, but I'm not good enough with the timing.

9548
06:48:13,720 --> 06:48:14,080
Obviously.

9549
06:48:14,300 --> 06:48:15,160
Oh, nice.

9550
06:48:15,760 --> 06:48:16,480
Shoo, shoo, shoo.

9551
06:48:18,100 --> 06:48:18,940
Don't charge at me.

9552
06:48:21,740 --> 06:48:22,100
Nice.

9553
06:48:26,830 --> 06:48:27,190
Ouch!

9554
06:48:48,440 --> 06:48:51,340
Oh, I can't get the kick in.

9555
06:48:52,820 --> 06:48:53,340
There we go.

9556
06:48:55,120 --> 06:48:55,480
Nice.

9557
06:48:58,800 --> 06:48:59,160
Oh.

9558
06:48:59,700 --> 06:49:02,440
I know he can get me with that move too.

9559
06:49:02,540 --> 06:49:03,620
He'll like get up and kick me.

9560
06:49:04,780 --> 06:49:05,140
Yeah.

9561
06:49:06,020 --> 06:49:06,380
Oh.

9562
06:49:06,460 --> 06:49:06,480
Nice.

9563
06:49:06,480 --> 06:49:07,320
Dang it.

9564
06:49:08,160 --> 06:49:08,600
Ah!

9565
06:49:08,900 --> 06:49:09,260
Dude!

9566
06:49:09,380 --> 06:49:11,120
I knew he was gonna...

9567
06:49:11,120 --> 06:49:11,820
Oh, my God!

9568
06:49:13,760 --> 06:49:14,200
You!

9569
06:49:15,920 --> 06:49:16,780
You're so annoying.

9570
06:49:17,180 --> 06:49:18,160
You're so annoying.

9571
06:49:25,200 --> 06:49:26,240
Oh, my God.

9572
06:49:26,300 --> 06:49:26,900
I'm gonna...

9573
06:49:26,900 --> 06:49:28,060
I'm actually...

9574
06:49:31,020 --> 06:49:31,460
Please.

9575
06:49:35,620 --> 06:49:36,300
So close!

9576
06:49:36,800 --> 06:49:37,040
So close!

9577
06:49:37,120 --> 06:49:37,440
Come on!

9578
06:49:37,500 --> 06:49:37,780
Come on!

9579
06:49:39,260 --> 06:49:39,920
No, please.

9580
06:49:40,160 --> 06:49:40,800
Don't charge.

9581
06:49:40,840 --> 06:49:41,380
Don't charge at me.

9582
06:49:42,220 --> 06:49:42,660
Fuck.

9583
06:49:42,660 --> 06:49:42,840
Oh, no.

9584
06:49:52,540 --> 06:49:53,860
Oh, my God.

9585
06:49:54,120 --> 06:49:54,880
I'm so close.

9586
06:49:57,080 --> 06:49:58,480
I'm sweating so bad.

9587
06:50:02,880 --> 06:50:05,820
We trade a jank X-Fight for an extra jank.

9588
06:50:06,200 --> 06:50:08,440
No, this fight was also really...

9589
06:50:08,440 --> 06:50:12,640
I remember this fight was hard in the first one too, because it's so tight.

9590
06:50:15,000 --> 06:50:15,520
Oh.

9591
06:50:16,220 --> 06:50:16,740
Contacts.

9592
06:50:16,820 --> 06:50:17,920
I need to put in some eye drops.

9593
06:50:18,100 --> 06:50:18,700
Oh, no.

9594
06:50:18,700 --> 06:50:18,720
Oh, no.

9595
06:50:19,680 --> 06:50:20,240
Ah!

9596
06:50:23,550 --> 06:50:23,830
Ugh.

9597
06:50:26,050 --> 06:50:26,610
Okay.

9598
06:50:26,790 --> 06:50:28,270
We still have one last little bit.

9599
06:50:28,710 --> 06:50:30,630
One last little bit and we're done, guys.

9600
06:50:31,470 --> 06:50:32,410
We got this.

9601
06:50:33,570 --> 06:50:34,990
Just like MGS4.

9602
06:50:35,390 --> 06:50:36,150
I know.

9603
06:50:39,550 --> 06:50:42,610
This is so MGS4.

9604
06:50:42,870 --> 06:50:43,650
Oh, my God.

9605
06:50:46,570 --> 06:50:48,930
This part is so MGS4.

9606
06:50:49,230 --> 06:50:49,550
Ah!

9607
06:50:50,030 --> 06:50:50,590
Oh, my God.

9608
06:50:50,590 --> 06:50:50,610
Oh.

9609
06:50:50,610 --> 06:50:51,030
Oh, my God.

9610
06:50:51,970 --> 06:50:52,990
Thank you for the raid!

9611
06:50:53,210 --> 06:50:53,770
Thank you!

9612
06:51:01,050 --> 06:51:05,910
If you just came in, we're at the very end of Metal Gear Solid, so if you don't want spoilers...

9613
06:51:05,910 --> 06:51:10,410
Well, Metal Gear Solid the Twin Snakes, but if you don't want spoilers, maybe head on out.

9614
06:51:11,090 --> 06:51:12,250
Murphy, thanks for the fine gift!

9615
06:51:12,630 --> 06:51:13,590
Thank you!

9616
06:51:22,880 --> 06:51:24,120
Raymak, thanks for the fine gift!

9617
06:51:24,960 --> 06:51:25,700
Thank you!

9618
06:51:30,340 --> 06:51:30,740
Damn!

9619
06:51:30,860 --> 06:51:32,020
She looks really buff here!

9620
06:51:32,260 --> 06:51:33,680
I mean, I know she is, but like...

9621
06:51:35,600 --> 06:51:36,400
That angle...

9622
06:51:36,400 --> 06:51:36,840
Meryl

9623
06:51:41,000 --> 06:51:48,480
Silverberg's ghost!

9624
06:51:51,740 --> 06:51:55,060
Oh, that was guttural!

9625
06:51:55,540 --> 06:51:56,460
Oh my gosh!

9626
06:51:56,980 --> 06:51:58,100
Gabo, thank you for the fine gift!

9627
06:51:58,240 --> 06:51:58,800
Star Creator!

9628
06:51:59,220 --> 06:51:59,940
Thank you for the fine gift!

9629
06:52:03,640 --> 06:52:04,060
Meryl!

9630
06:52:12,400 --> 06:52:14,100
They turned this into a Yakuza game?

9631
06:52:14,300 --> 06:52:14,520
No.

9632
06:52:14,920 --> 06:52:17,900
Yakuza turned itself into a Metal Gear game.

9633
06:52:24,240 --> 06:52:25,780
Pac-Tai, thanks for the fine gift!

9634
06:52:31,660 --> 06:52:32,500
Oh, Meryl...

9635
06:52:36,720 --> 06:52:37,560
Oh, Meryl...

9636
06:52:39,240 --> 06:52:40,540
Jay, thanks for the fine gift!

9637
06:52:41,140 --> 06:52:41,700
Thank you!

9638
06:52:42,660 --> 06:52:44,060
Oh my gosh, you guys, stop!

9639
06:52:45,960 --> 06:52:48,300
I'm trying to watch the scene.

9640
06:52:57,280 --> 06:52:58,080
Tick, tock!

9641
06:53:02,550 --> 06:53:04,030
Oh my gosh, he looks really dead.

9642
06:53:08,020 --> 06:53:08,900
It's okay, Snake.

9643
06:53:09,040 --> 06:53:09,520
It was me.

9644
06:53:09,820 --> 06:53:10,780
I did it.

9645
06:53:10,820 --> 06:53:11,300
Not you.

9646
06:53:11,380 --> 06:53:12,020
Don't take the...

9647
06:53:12,020 --> 06:53:16,740
Oh, I don't like what I... I don't like seeing him, like, putting this on himself when it was me.

9648
06:53:18,680 --> 06:53:19,900
Meryl, I'm sorry.

9649
06:53:20,160 --> 06:53:21,440
Dog Strike, thanks for the tech update.

9650
06:53:21,620 --> 06:53:22,160
Forgive me.

9651
06:53:22,300 --> 06:53:22,880
Thank you.

9652
06:53:24,040 --> 06:53:26,180
Meryl can't forgive anyone anymore.

9653
06:53:26,280 --> 06:53:28,180
Okay, you don't gotta say it like that, Otacon.

9654
06:53:28,320 --> 06:53:29,000
Come on.

9655
06:53:29,620 --> 06:53:30,080
Shh!

9656
06:53:31,880 --> 06:53:33,200
She's gone, Snake.

9657
06:53:35,140 --> 06:53:36,040
Because of me.

9658
06:53:36,500 --> 06:53:37,440
No, because of me.

9659
06:53:37,960 --> 06:53:40,900
I guess blaming yourself makes it easier, huh?

9660
06:53:42,260 --> 06:53:44,880
Focusing on that will keep you from thinking about her death.

9661
06:53:45,120 --> 06:53:46,140
What the hell do you know?

9662
06:53:46,140 --> 06:53:47,420
Meryl's dead.

9663
06:53:47,620 --> 06:53:48,340
I lost.

9664
06:53:49,760 --> 06:53:52,220
So... are you gonna stay here and die?

9665
06:53:52,900 --> 06:53:54,000
Along with her?

9666
06:53:57,360 --> 06:53:59,080
Snake... people die.

9667
06:54:00,340 --> 06:54:02,320
But death is not defeat.

9668
06:54:02,600 --> 06:54:03,940
He... he grew up so fast.

9669
06:54:04,280 --> 06:54:05,260
That's what Hemingway said.

9670
06:54:06,340 --> 06:54:08,640
I lost Wolf, too.

9671
06:54:09,460 --> 06:54:10,920
But that wasn't defeat.

9672
06:54:12,340 --> 06:54:14,440
She and I will be together forever.

9673
06:54:15,100 --> 06:54:15,820
People die when they are killed.

9674
06:54:15,820 --> 06:54:17,000
We didn't lose anything.

9675
06:54:20,400 --> 06:54:21,000
Together.

9676
06:54:21,000 --> 06:54:21,600
Forever.

9677
06:54:29,360 --> 06:54:31,140
It's true that Wolf is dead.

9678
06:54:32,280 --> 06:54:34,680
But our love didn't die with her.

9679
06:54:35,780 --> 06:54:38,800
Life isn't just a game of win or lose.

9680
06:54:40,140 --> 06:54:40,980
Don't you think?

9681
06:54:41,320 --> 06:54:42,580
Yeah, you can start new love.

9682
06:54:43,180 --> 06:54:44,460
Let's live, Snake.

9683
06:54:44,760 --> 06:54:45,220
Together.

9684
06:54:46,520 --> 06:54:48,720
There's a parking garage right next door.

9685
06:54:48,720 --> 06:54:50,440
We can get to the surface from there.

9686
06:54:50,540 --> 06:54:51,740
The way he like dropped down so fast.

9687
06:54:52,280 --> 06:54:52,760
Come on.

9688
06:54:52,760 --> 06:54:54,460
I released all the security locks.

9689
06:54:55,560 --> 06:54:56,560
It'll be okay.

9690
06:54:57,480 --> 06:54:58,600
We can escape.

9691
06:54:59,320 --> 06:55:00,040
Come on, Snake.

9692
06:55:00,040 --> 06:55:01,740
You have my word on it.

9693
06:55:01,780 --> 06:55:02,220
He's gonna...

9694
06:55:03,740 --> 06:55:05,280
Otacon is protecting him.

9695
06:55:06,180 --> 06:55:07,140
Otacon, you've changed.

9696
06:55:09,020 --> 06:55:09,680
You have...

9697
06:55:09,680 --> 06:55:11,240
I'm through regretting the past.

9698
06:55:11,260 --> 06:55:12,980
You have to protect the ones that you love.

9699
06:55:13,000 --> 06:55:14,860
Life isn't all about loss, you know?

9700
06:55:18,320 --> 06:55:19,400
You've changed.

9701
06:55:19,800 --> 06:55:20,820
God, she looks really bad.

9702
06:55:21,820 --> 06:55:22,940
I mean, she's dead.

9703
06:55:23,120 --> 06:55:24,940
So, of course, but like...

9704
06:55:24,940 --> 06:55:25,760
Oh my God.

9705
06:55:26,220 --> 06:55:27,000
It started.

9706
06:55:27,360 --> 06:55:28,400
Otacon falling over.

9707
06:55:28,460 --> 06:55:29,360
Number two.

9708
06:55:29,380 --> 06:55:31,560
Those guys seem like they only hurry when they're destroying things.

9709
06:55:33,060 --> 06:55:34,160
He grew up.

9710
06:55:34,180 --> 06:55:34,400
Good.

9711
06:55:34,620 --> 06:55:36,020
Let him destroy it.

9712
06:55:36,540 --> 06:55:39,000
But they can't destroy the human spirit.

9713
06:55:41,630 --> 06:55:42,820
You should like leave.

9714
06:55:42,980 --> 06:55:43,260
Okay.

9715
06:55:43,260 --> 06:55:43,980
Okay.

9716
06:55:44,420 --> 06:55:45,140
Let's go.

9717
06:55:49,490 --> 06:55:50,210
Bye, Meryl.

9718
06:55:50,450 --> 06:55:51,090
Bye, Meryl.

9719
06:55:51,410 --> 06:55:53,030
I hope you're still watching me.

9720
06:55:55,550 --> 06:55:57,870
You'll see if I'm the legendary man or not.

9721
06:56:01,070 --> 06:56:04,490
The only reason I don't like this, I think, is because it's so sad for Snake.

9722
06:56:09,180 --> 06:56:10,360
So sad for him.

9723
06:56:13,120 --> 06:56:14,740
I love Snake so much.

9724
06:56:16,100 --> 06:56:17,200
I love him...

9725
06:56:17,200 --> 06:56:17,440
Come on.

9726
06:56:17,540 --> 06:56:18,100
Hustle.

9727
06:56:18,200 --> 06:56:19,220
So much.

9728
06:56:19,400 --> 06:56:21,580
Snake, it's cold outside.

9729
06:56:21,700 --> 06:56:23,120
You'll freeze like that.

9730
06:56:23,400 --> 06:56:24,500
Give me my clothes.

9731
06:56:33,360 --> 06:56:34,780
Not because Meryl died.

9732
06:56:35,480 --> 06:56:36,820
I like Meryl too.

9733
06:56:37,100 --> 06:56:40,880
But watching Snake's reaction to it is... makes me the most sad.

9734
06:56:42,840 --> 06:56:44,300
My sneaking suit.

9735
06:56:44,920 --> 06:56:45,480
Eevee!

9736
06:56:45,540 --> 06:56:46,120
You better hurry.

9737
06:56:47,040 --> 06:56:48,920
You just... you just stepped on it.

9738
06:56:48,960 --> 06:56:49,560
Wait a second.

9739
06:56:49,740 --> 06:56:51,040
The abs are fake?

9740
06:56:51,840 --> 06:56:54,000
The abs are drawn onto the suit?

9741
06:56:55,940 --> 06:56:58,420
Looking good, Mr...

9742
06:56:58,420 --> 06:56:58,620
Oh.

9743
06:57:02,020 --> 06:57:02,660
Now

9744
06:57:08,730 --> 06:57:10,410
you look like yourself again.

9745
06:57:10,630 --> 06:57:12,310
Why are you standing there like that?

9746
06:57:23,400 --> 06:57:24,040
Meryl.

9747
06:57:34,330 --> 06:57:38,610
Who put a sniffer over you?

9748
06:57:39,610 --> 06:57:43,670
You don't like this, are you?

9749
06:57:44,410 --> 06:57:46,030
It's cute!

9750
06:57:52,650 --> 06:57:54,530
That história...

9751
06:57:54,530 --> 06:57:54,690
He set the world on fire.

9752
06:57:54,690 --> 06:57:54,910
Plenty of things being said this year.

9753
06:57:54,910 --> 06:57:55,170
It was just supposed to be that vein in that你有.

9754
06:57:55,170 --> 06:57:55,750
preceding the announcement.

9755
06:57:55,790 --> 06:57:57,810
Why are you acting like you're not in danger anymore?

9756
06:57:57,810 --> 06:57:58,250
Amen.

9757
06:58:02,630 --> 06:58:03,030
Oh!

9758
06:58:03,030 --> 06:58:04,830
Why didn't you turn off the cameras?

9759
06:58:05,610 --> 06:58:07,630
When you turned off everything else!

9760
06:58:09,050 --> 06:58:09,450
Wait...

9761
06:58:11,410 --> 06:58:11,810
Uh...

9762
06:58:12,250 --> 06:58:12,950
Okay, hold on.

9763
06:58:13,090 --> 06:58:13,510
Oh gosh.

9764
06:58:14,350 --> 06:58:14,970
Oh my god.

9765
06:58:18,990 --> 06:58:20,510
Yeah, let's go, let's go, let's go!

9766
06:58:21,010 --> 06:58:21,610
Oh my god.

9767
06:58:22,510 --> 06:58:23,830
Uh, hold on, hold on.

9768
06:58:25,110 --> 06:58:25,970
I'm trying to get in!

9769
06:58:29,410 --> 06:58:30,090
I'm trying!

9770
06:58:31,790 --> 06:58:35,410
Uh, how do I use this?

9771
06:58:36,350 --> 06:58:38,470
Oh, shoot, uh...

9772
06:58:40,730 --> 06:58:41,450
Oh my god.

9773
06:58:43,390 --> 06:58:44,070
Can I...

9774
06:58:44,070 --> 06:58:44,930
Can I lower it?

9775
06:58:45,050 --> 06:58:45,470
Wait...

9776
06:58:45,470 --> 06:58:46,470
Can you please?

9777
06:58:46,630 --> 06:58:47,570
How do I lower it?

9778
06:58:48,730 --> 06:58:49,170
Uh...

9779
06:58:49,170 --> 06:58:51,570
Wait, how do... No, seriously, how do I lower it?

9780
06:58:51,610 --> 06:58:52,450
Why isn't it...

9781
06:58:52,450 --> 06:58:53,270
Uh...

9782
06:58:55,970 --> 06:58:57,250
How do I lower it?

9783
06:58:57,290 --> 06:58:57,730
Oh my god!

9784
06:58:58,330 --> 06:58:59,390
I don't know!

9785
06:58:59,870 --> 06:59:01,170
Oh, in first person!

9786
06:59:01,430 --> 06:59:02,450
Oh, great.

9787
06:59:02,750 --> 06:59:03,730
Oh my gosh.

9788
06:59:04,150 --> 06:59:05,130
What a mess.

9789
06:59:12,870 --> 06:59:19,190
I'm just gonna shoot ahead.

9790
06:59:22,650 --> 06:59:24,270
It's unlimited ammo anyway.

9791
06:59:28,320 --> 06:59:29,200
Why did...

9792
06:59:29,380 --> 06:59:29,480
Why did I do that?

9793
06:59:35,440 --> 06:59:36,040
I'm trying!

9794
06:59:38,200 --> 06:59:39,000
I got him.

9795
06:59:39,340 --> 06:59:39,740
Oh!

9796
06:59:41,600 --> 06:59:43,540
I'm in a real, like, adventure...

9797
06:59:43,540 --> 06:59:43,900
Oh, gosh.

9798
06:59:44,020 --> 06:59:45,180
I can't see anything, Otacon.

9799
06:59:45,360 --> 06:59:46,640
Wait, how do I... There we go.

9800
06:59:46,760 --> 06:59:48,880
Oh my god, why do you...

9801
06:59:48,880 --> 06:59:50,360
do that every time, Otacon?

9802
06:59:51,400 --> 06:59:52,380
It's not very helpful.

9803
06:59:54,980 --> 06:59:56,700
Snake, I'm... I mean, Otacon, I'm trying.

9804
06:59:57,180 --> 06:59:58,320
This thing is...

9805
06:59:59,340 --> 06:59:59,740
God,

9806
07:00:11,220 --> 07:00:12,600
I have, like, no life left!

9807
07:00:13,000 --> 07:00:14,200
Otacon, I'm gonna die!

9808
07:00:14,780 --> 07:00:16,060
Otacon, I'm gonna bleed out!

9809
07:00:16,140 --> 07:00:16,280
Okay.

9810
07:00:17,720 --> 07:00:19,200
One HP and a dream.

9811
07:00:24,080 --> 07:00:25,540
Otacon, I'm gonna bleed out!

9812
07:00:28,920 --> 07:00:31,000
Snake, it's not over yet!

9813
07:00:33,100 --> 07:00:33,540
Yeah!

9814
07:00:45,830 --> 07:00:48,550
I won't let you... I won't let you take my one life left.

9815
07:00:48,750 --> 07:00:49,870
I won't let you take it!

9816
07:00:50,130 --> 07:00:51,330
I won't let you take it!

9817
07:00:54,730 --> 07:00:55,510
Oh, dang!

9818
07:00:56,330 --> 07:00:57,130
You took it!

9819
07:01:00,940 --> 07:01:02,120
Hey, I'm shooting this.

9820
07:01:02,360 --> 07:01:03,440
Oh my gosh, ouch!

9821
07:01:04,920 --> 07:01:06,400
Why am I not hitting... There we go.

9822
07:01:09,740 --> 07:01:10,580
Yeah, that's right.

9823
07:01:12,120 --> 07:01:12,800
Oh my gosh.

9824
07:01:12,960 --> 07:01:13,660
Oh, ouch!

9825
07:01:15,680 --> 07:01:16,220
Come on!

9826
07:01:16,880 --> 07:01:17,280
Yeah!

9827
07:01:18,320 --> 07:01:18,720
Yeah!

9828
07:01:19,560 --> 07:01:20,200
I'm shooting!

9829
07:01:20,360 --> 07:01:21,360
I am shooting your butt!

9830
07:01:21,520 --> 07:01:22,500
I am shooting your butt!

9831
07:01:22,740 --> 07:01:23,880
You cannot...

9832
07:01:25,120 --> 07:01:26,180
Yeah, that's right.

9833
07:01:27,340 --> 07:01:28,420
Put it on a shirt!

9834
07:01:29,040 --> 07:01:29,500
Please!

9835
07:01:31,500 --> 07:01:33,860
If I die here, that would be insane.

9836
07:01:49,240 --> 07:01:50,700
The music is awesome.

9837
07:02:08,960 --> 07:02:10,200
Oh, are you okay?

9838
07:02:10,820 --> 07:02:11,980
Are you okay, Otacon?

9839
07:02:12,200 --> 07:02:14,100
I need you to drive the car, Otacon!

9840
07:02:15,760 --> 07:02:17,520
Otacon, I need you to drive the car!

9841
07:02:18,860 --> 07:02:19,780
His glasses!

9842
07:02:20,720 --> 07:02:21,600
Oh my god.

9843
07:02:22,920 --> 07:02:24,100
Shoot, Snake!

9844
07:02:24,220 --> 07:02:24,540
Shoot!

9845
07:02:29,370 --> 07:02:29,990
Oh my god.

9846
07:02:30,370 --> 07:02:31,750
He's gun dancing!

9847
07:02:32,290 --> 07:02:32,970
Yeah!

9848
07:02:38,880 --> 07:02:39,560
Yeah!

9849
07:02:56,540 --> 07:02:57,700
Oh my god!

9850
07:02:57,820 --> 07:02:59,320
Oh no!

9851
07:03:02,260 --> 07:03:02,940
Oh!

9852
07:03:03,940 --> 07:03:05,020
So close!

9853
07:03:05,720 --> 07:03:06,780
Are you okay?

9854
07:03:06,920 --> 07:03:08,000
Are you okay, little baby?

9855
07:03:09,380 --> 07:03:10,920
Is this CQC?

9856
07:03:12,500 --> 07:03:14,000
Otacon, are you okay?

9857
07:03:14,460 --> 07:03:16,400
How many Matrix scenes are there?

9858
07:03:16,600 --> 07:03:18,840
You have to understand, I think the Matrix was like...

9859
07:03:18,840 --> 07:03:19,340
Otacon, can you move?

9860
07:03:19,740 --> 07:03:21,500
...was so popular around this time.

9861
07:03:21,540 --> 07:03:23,100
Oh my god, he's...

9862
07:03:23,680 --> 07:03:25,200
He's all bent backwards!

9863
07:03:28,900 --> 07:03:31,120
It's no use, pulls him out anyway.

9864
07:03:31,880 --> 07:03:32,660
There you go.

9865
07:03:35,520 --> 07:03:36,840
I'm surprised he can stand.

9866
07:03:39,260 --> 07:03:40,200
Don't get his toes.

9867
07:03:40,200 --> 07:03:40,460
Don't get his toes.

9868
07:03:40,460 --> 07:03:40,660
Damn.

9869
07:03:41,000 --> 07:03:42,840
This guy and his nine lives.

9870
07:03:48,760 --> 07:03:49,800
This guy and his nine lives.

9871
07:03:49,800 --> 07:03:49,840
Snake.

9872
07:03:50,580 --> 07:03:51,100
Snake.

9873
07:03:52,620 --> 07:03:54,860
There's less tension here because in the original...

9874
07:03:54,860 --> 07:03:55,320
Snake!

9875
07:03:55,320 --> 07:03:56,460
They're trapped under the car.

9876
07:03:56,820 --> 07:03:58,800
But here he's just standing in front of...

9877
07:03:58,800 --> 07:03:59,700
Do something, Snake!

9878
07:04:00,040 --> 07:04:01,320
You can stop him!

9879
07:04:01,320 --> 07:04:02,620
Oh!

9880
07:04:03,260 --> 07:04:04,240
Oh no!

9881
07:04:06,140 --> 07:04:07,540
Oh!

9882
07:04:07,660 --> 07:04:08,420
Oh!

9883
07:04:08,860 --> 07:04:10,260
Oh!

9884
07:04:10,700 --> 07:04:12,080
Oh, MBS!

9885
07:04:14,160 --> 07:04:15,560
Fox!

9886
07:04:17,520 --> 07:04:18,920
Fox?

9887
07:04:25,100 --> 07:04:26,060
Die!

9888
07:04:26,820 --> 07:04:27,620
Die!

9889
07:04:29,900 --> 07:04:31,300
Yeah!

9890
07:04:31,700 --> 07:04:32,460
Yeah!

9891
07:04:32,460 --> 07:04:32,620
Yeah!

9892
07:04:35,940 --> 07:04:36,960
Oh, that was it?

9893
07:04:41,050 --> 07:04:42,430
Oh, never mind, it wasn't...

9894
07:04:42,430 --> 07:04:43,030
Oh, he's away!

9895
07:04:49,270 --> 07:04:50,510
Give it up.

9896
07:04:51,870 --> 07:04:53,570
Oh, he's standing back up?

9897
07:04:53,810 --> 07:04:54,450
Excuse me?

9898
07:05:06,390 --> 07:05:07,350
Are you...

9899
07:05:07,870 --> 07:05:09,710
Otacon being like, am I third wheeling?

9900
07:05:13,990 --> 07:05:14,470
Oh my god.

9901
07:05:17,270 --> 07:05:21,100
You guys, they're brothers!

9902
07:05:21,300 --> 07:05:21,720
Stop!

9903
07:05:24,220 --> 07:05:25,500
Oh my gosh.

9904
07:05:27,420 --> 07:05:29,180
If he's dead...

9905
07:05:30,140 --> 07:05:31,260
That means...

9906
07:05:31,260 --> 07:05:31,760
No, Snake.

9907
07:05:32,040 --> 07:05:32,740
Don't say it.

9908
07:05:33,760 --> 07:05:35,280
Don't think about it, Snake.

9909
07:05:35,520 --> 07:05:36,100
Don't say it.

9910
07:05:36,140 --> 07:05:36,720
Don't spray it.

9911
07:05:37,160 --> 07:05:37,720
Snake.

9912
07:05:38,700 --> 07:05:39,260
Don't.

9913
07:05:39,300 --> 07:05:40,600
What happened to the air raid?

9914
07:05:41,900 --> 07:05:43,940
No stealth bombers in sight.

9915
07:05:44,820 --> 07:05:45,440
The Colonel.

9916
07:05:50,030 --> 07:05:51,470
Chat is so down bad.

9917
07:05:53,030 --> 07:05:53,630
Colonel!

9918
07:05:54,150 --> 07:05:55,090
Are you okay?

9919
07:05:55,450 --> 07:05:57,050
Colonel, what happened?

9920
07:05:57,350 --> 07:05:59,790
The Secretary of Defense has been arrested.

9921
07:06:00,370 --> 07:06:01,270
Early retirement.

9922
07:06:01,950 --> 07:06:02,550
Arrested.

9923
07:06:02,970 --> 07:06:05,870
I was able to get into contact with the President.

9924
07:06:06,450 --> 07:06:07,390
Metal gear.

9925
07:06:07,690 --> 07:06:08,970
The training exercise.

9926
07:06:09,550 --> 07:06:10,170
All of it.

9927
07:06:10,250 --> 07:06:13,370
It was all the Secretary of Defense acting alone.

9928
07:06:13,510 --> 07:06:14,850
Of course it was.

9929
07:06:14,850 --> 07:06:15,910
Of course it was.

9930
07:06:15,990 --> 07:06:16,970
What happened to the air raid?

9931
07:06:17,050 --> 07:06:18,150
And the nuclear strike?

9932
07:06:18,650 --> 07:06:20,390
The orders were rescinded.

9933
07:06:20,510 --> 07:06:24,470
The F-117s and the B-2 bombers have returned to the base.

9934
07:06:24,650 --> 07:06:28,190
Once again, I have complete authority over this operation.

9935
07:06:28,550 --> 07:06:29,390
I see.

9936
07:06:29,650 --> 07:06:33,030
Your Oshii's graduation is not too late.

9937
07:06:34,150 --> 07:06:36,250
I wonder about that.

9938
07:06:36,610 --> 07:06:39,330
In any case, the danger's over.

9939
07:06:39,850 --> 07:06:40,810
Thanks, Snake.

9940
07:06:42,410 --> 07:06:44,630
Colonel, about Meryl...

9941
07:06:44,630 --> 07:06:47,170
I already know.

9942
07:06:47,410 --> 07:06:47,790
Aww.

9943
07:06:48,690 --> 07:06:49,890
I'm sorry, Colonel.

9944
07:06:51,210 --> 07:06:52,250
Here's where we learn.

9945
07:06:52,430 --> 07:06:54,250
Meryl was... my daughter.

9946
07:06:54,710 --> 07:06:55,210
What?

9947
07:06:56,090 --> 07:06:58,170
I didn't find out until recently.

9948
07:06:58,670 --> 07:07:00,370
I got a letter from her mother.

9949
07:07:00,750 --> 07:07:02,250
My dead brother's wife.

9950
07:07:02,470 --> 07:07:03,450
You should have told her.

9951
07:07:03,450 --> 07:07:05,870
I was going to tell her after this operation was over.

9952
07:07:06,030 --> 07:07:06,670
No, you can't wait.

9953
07:07:07,890 --> 07:07:09,010
It's okay, Snake.

9954
07:07:10,130 --> 07:07:10,930
Thanks anyway.

9955
07:07:11,330 --> 07:07:11,730
What?

9956
07:07:13,010 --> 07:07:15,750
Snake, I'm sorry I kept a lot of things from you.

9957
07:07:16,230 --> 07:07:17,450
It's okay, Colonel.

9958
07:07:18,750 --> 07:07:19,630
Bro, I'm stuck.

9959
07:07:19,790 --> 07:07:20,590
I'm not a Colonel.

9960
07:07:21,490 --> 07:07:22,330
Oh, that's right.

9961
07:07:22,910 --> 07:07:23,310
Colonel.

9962
07:07:23,310 --> 07:07:24,310
I've got a present for you.

9963
07:07:25,010 --> 07:07:26,690
There's a snowmobile close to you.

9964
07:07:27,130 --> 07:07:29,030
Mei Ling saw it on the satellite photos.

9965
07:07:29,970 --> 07:07:32,430
This time of year, the glaciers are pretty calm.

9966
07:07:32,710 --> 07:07:34,670
You should be able to ride right out of there.

9967
07:07:35,070 --> 07:07:35,470
Yippee!

9968
07:07:35,910 --> 07:07:37,490
Oh, but the boys at the D.I.A.

9969
07:07:37,490 --> 07:07:38,330
and the N.S.A.

9970
07:07:38,330 --> 07:07:39,890
never expected you to come home alive.

9971
07:07:40,490 --> 07:07:41,230
Me neither.

9972
07:07:41,770 --> 07:07:43,650
I'd better not show my face right there.

9973
07:07:44,210 --> 07:07:45,350
No danger of that.

9974
07:07:45,350 --> 07:07:49,410
You two officially died after your jeep sank into the ocean.

9975
07:07:50,810 --> 07:07:52,610
It's not too far from the truth.

9976
07:07:52,970 --> 07:07:56,470
There's also a helicopter waiting for you at the Fox Islands.

9977
07:07:56,850 --> 07:07:57,190
There's also a helicopter waiting for you at the Fox Islands.

9978
07:07:57,190 --> 07:07:58,050
Okay, Roy.

9979
07:07:59,150 --> 07:08:00,490
Are you going to be okay?

9980
07:08:01,230 --> 07:08:01,890
Don't worry.

9981
07:08:02,470 --> 07:08:04,050
I've got an insurance policy.

9982
07:08:04,650 --> 07:08:07,350
A hard copy of all of Mei Ling's data.

9983
07:08:07,950 --> 07:08:12,530
As long as I've got that, you, me, and Mei Ling will be fine.

9984
07:08:12,650 --> 07:08:13,070
Oh, yeah.

9985
07:08:13,070 --> 07:08:15,690
The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon.

9986
07:08:16,130 --> 07:08:17,750
They won't be able to follow us.

9987
07:08:17,990 --> 07:08:19,630
I guess we won't meet again.

9988
07:08:20,030 --> 07:08:20,690
Don't worry.

9989
07:08:21,350 --> 07:08:22,870
I'll pay you a visit sometime.

9990
07:08:23,270 --> 07:08:23,750
Really?

9991
07:08:24,230 --> 07:08:25,970
I'll look forward to that.

9992
07:08:26,150 --> 07:08:28,630
Roy, just tell me one thing.

9993
07:08:28,910 --> 07:08:29,930
The save data.

9994
07:08:30,770 --> 07:08:32,990
You guys say it's save scumming, but no.

9995
07:08:33,350 --> 07:08:36,030
It's preserving the evidence.

9996
07:08:36,110 --> 07:08:39,030
Naomi said she wants to talk to you face to face about that.

9997
07:08:39,130 --> 07:08:39,550
Duh.

9998
07:08:39,610 --> 07:08:40,110
How is she?

9999
07:08:40,510 --> 07:08:41,190
Don't worry.

10000
07:08:41,430 --> 07:08:42,910
Mei Ling's with her right now.

10001
07:08:43,070 --> 07:08:44,690
I'm switching over to Naomi.

10002
07:08:45,210 --> 07:08:45,770
Snake.

10003
07:08:46,010 --> 07:08:47,110
Oh, God.

10004
07:08:47,590 --> 07:08:48,150
Sorry.

10005
07:08:49,090 --> 07:08:49,990
I heard.

10006
07:08:50,730 --> 07:08:51,770
About my brother.

10007
07:08:52,810 --> 07:08:52,990
Uh.

10008
07:08:54,230 --> 07:08:54,790
Fox.

10009
07:08:54,930 --> 07:08:55,310
No.

10010
07:08:55,870 --> 07:08:56,430
Frank.

10011
07:08:56,730 --> 07:08:57,990
Wanted to tell you something.

10012
07:08:59,970 --> 07:09:02,990
He told me to tell you to forget about him.

10013
07:09:03,110 --> 07:09:04,970
And to go on with your own life.

10014
07:09:05,470 --> 07:09:07,110
Snake is such a good guy.

10015
07:09:07,390 --> 07:09:08,170
Frankie said that?

10016
07:09:08,430 --> 07:09:08,950
Yeah.

10017
07:09:09,170 --> 07:09:12,150
He also said he'll always love you.

10018
07:09:13,070 --> 07:09:13,570
Snake is such a good guy.

10019
07:09:13,570 --> 07:09:15,310
God, that moment was so ruined by Naomi.

10020
07:09:15,530 --> 07:09:18,930
Your brother just saved you, me, and the whole world.

10021
07:09:19,090 --> 07:09:20,070
Snake is such a good guy.

10022
07:09:20,070 --> 07:09:22,690
He fought on sheer willpower until the very end.

10023
07:09:23,590 --> 07:09:24,070
Maybe.

10024
07:09:25,510 --> 07:09:27,650
Maybe now he's finally found some peace.

10025
07:09:27,930 --> 07:09:29,650
Tell me when I spread false information on the internet.

10026
07:09:29,890 --> 07:09:31,150
My brother was already dying.

10027
07:09:31,370 --> 07:09:31,550
Oh.

10028
07:09:32,630 --> 07:09:34,990
Ever since he fought with you in Zanzibar land.

10029
07:09:35,770 --> 07:09:37,030
He's been like a ghost.

10030
07:09:38,750 --> 07:09:41,230
A ghost looking for a place to die.

10031
07:09:42,170 --> 07:09:43,050
A ghost looking for a place to die.

10032
07:09:45,070 --> 07:09:46,670
He's been looking for a place to die.

10033
07:09:46,670 --> 07:09:46,870
Naomi.

10034
07:09:48,210 --> 07:09:50,390
Liquid died from Fox Die 2.

10035
07:09:51,610 --> 07:09:52,650
What about me?

10036
07:09:52,750 --> 07:09:53,190
Oh boy.

10037
07:09:53,390 --> 07:09:55,870
I can't wait to get some real answers here.

10038
07:09:57,070 --> 07:09:57,930
It's up to you.

10039
07:09:58,230 --> 07:09:59,110
What do you mean?

10040
07:09:59,510 --> 07:10:00,510
What do you mean?

10041
07:10:00,970 --> 07:10:03,190
Everybody dies when their time's up.

10042
07:10:03,670 --> 07:10:04,850
Naomi, that- yeah.

10043
07:10:05,870 --> 07:10:08,370
It's up to you how you use the time left to you.

10044
07:10:08,590 --> 07:10:10,150
You gave me this virus.

10045
07:10:10,150 --> 07:10:10,810
Live snake.

10046
07:10:12,290 --> 07:10:13,290
That's all I can say.

10047
07:10:13,310 --> 07:10:14,690
Naomi, you gave me a virus.

10048
07:10:15,350 --> 07:10:17,050
How long do I have left to live?

10049
07:10:18,650 --> 07:10:22,610
Each person is born with their fate written into their own genetic code.

10050
07:10:23,290 --> 07:10:24,590
Inscribed into their genes.

10051
07:10:25,330 --> 07:10:25,810
Naomi.

10052
07:10:26,010 --> 07:10:27,590
But that's not all there is to life.

10053
07:10:27,830 --> 07:10:29,450
I finally realized that.

10054
07:10:30,790 --> 07:10:31,970
I told you before.

10055
07:10:32,350 --> 07:10:33,790
I killed everybody around me.

10056
07:10:33,790 --> 07:10:34,950
The reason I was interested in genes and DNA.

10057
07:10:35,290 --> 07:10:37,990
Naomi, everybody around me is dead because of this virus.

10058
07:10:38,650 --> 07:10:39,590
Because I wanted to know who I was.

10059
07:10:40,150 --> 07:10:40,710
What do I have left?

10060
07:10:41,370 --> 07:10:43,470
I thought that if I analyzed my DNA.

10061
07:10:43,850 --> 07:10:45,670
I could find out who I was.

10062
07:10:45,790 --> 07:10:47,930
Nobody cares who you are.

10063
07:10:48,610 --> 07:10:50,370
And I thought that if I knew that.

10064
07:10:50,430 --> 07:10:50,930
Oh, God.

10065
07:10:51,210 --> 07:10:53,490
Then I'd know what path I should take in life.

10066
07:10:53,730 --> 07:10:57,090
I secretly wish Snake would princess carry Otacon here.

10067
07:10:57,330 --> 07:10:58,190
It's not a secret.

10068
07:10:58,550 --> 07:10:59,630
I just wish it.

10069
07:10:59,870 --> 07:11:01,050
I didn't learn anything.

10070
07:11:01,450 --> 07:11:03,330
Yeah, you didn't learn anything.

10071
07:11:03,410 --> 07:11:04,690
Just look at the genome soldiers.

10072
07:11:05,710 --> 07:11:07,930
You can input all the genetic information.

10073
07:11:07,930 --> 07:11:08,710
Okay, here it comes.

10074
07:11:10,150 --> 07:11:11,690
Make them into the strongest soldiers.

10075
07:11:11,930 --> 07:11:12,650
Oh, Otacon.

10076
07:11:12,750 --> 07:11:13,770
I love this part so much.

10077
07:11:13,770 --> 07:11:19,310
The most we can say about DNA is that its genetic information houses a person's strengths or destiny.

10078
07:11:19,670 --> 07:11:20,170
And...

10079
07:11:20,170 --> 07:11:20,810
He looks so freaky.

10080
07:11:20,810 --> 07:11:23,170
You mustn't allow yourself to be chained to fate.

10081
07:11:23,570 --> 07:11:25,230
To be ruled by your genes.

10082
07:11:26,650 --> 07:11:29,730
Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.

10083
07:11:29,850 --> 07:11:30,450
Well, you...

10084
07:11:30,450 --> 07:11:32,610
Oh, here he goes!

10085
07:11:32,910 --> 07:11:33,550
Oh, no!

10086
07:11:33,750 --> 07:11:35,890
Whether you've been programmed or not isn't important.

10087
07:11:37,290 --> 07:11:40,450
The important thing is that you choose life.

10088
07:11:40,450 --> 07:11:41,110
Just carry him!

10089
07:11:41,290 --> 07:11:42,210
Just carry him!

10090
07:11:42,470 --> 07:11:43,090
And then...

10091
07:11:43,090 --> 07:11:43,570
Oh, no!

10092
07:11:43,630 --> 07:11:44,110
Here he goes!

10093
07:11:45,950 --> 07:11:46,930
Don't you think, Snake?

10094
07:11:51,420 --> 07:11:52,960
I'm gonna choose life, too.

10095
07:11:54,760 --> 07:11:58,200
Until today, I've always looked for a reason to live.

10096
07:12:03,020 --> 07:12:04,260
I'm going to just live.

10097
07:12:06,620 --> 07:12:08,040
He just doesn't stop!

10098
07:12:08,100 --> 07:12:08,680
He just doesn't stop!

10099
07:12:09,520 --> 07:12:10,040
He just doesn't stop!

10100
07:12:10,700 --> 07:12:15,240
Genes exist to pass down our hopes and dreams for the future for our children.

10101
07:12:17,040 --> 07:12:19,420
Living is a link to what will come.

10102
07:12:19,840 --> 07:12:21,860
All life is tethered to the future.

10103
07:12:22,020 --> 07:12:25,000
That's exactly why I got this ending.

10104
07:12:26,140 --> 07:12:27,900
Because that part is so funny.

10105
07:12:28,780 --> 07:12:30,460
Then the world can change.

10106
07:12:30,820 --> 07:12:33,820
He just keeps going.

10107
07:12:33,820 --> 07:12:34,840
He just keeps sliding.

10108
07:12:35,740 --> 07:12:37,880
I can't even listen to Naomi.

10109
07:12:38,340 --> 07:12:39,240
Oh, gosh.

10110
07:12:40,060 --> 07:12:41,900
Okay, she's finally done.

10111
07:12:42,720 --> 07:12:44,660
This is what Meryl died for.

10112
07:12:46,640 --> 07:12:49,820
Until today, I've only lived for myself.

10113
07:12:50,940 --> 07:12:53,660
Survival has been the only thing I cared about in my life.

10114
07:12:53,840 --> 07:12:54,940
Survival has been the only thing I cared about in my life.

10115
07:12:55,040 --> 07:12:56,360
That's not just you.

10116
07:12:56,880 --> 07:12:58,280
That's how everyone is.

10117
07:12:58,920 --> 07:13:02,820
I only felt truly alive when I was staring death in the face.

10118
07:13:03,180 --> 07:13:03,520
I only felt truly alive when I was staring death in the face.

10119
07:13:03,880 --> 07:13:04,760
I don't know.

10120
07:13:05,300 --> 07:13:07,080
Maybe it's written into my genes.

10121
07:13:07,420 --> 07:13:08,240
Maybe it's written into my genes.

10122
07:13:08,240 --> 07:13:10,220
What about now?

10123
07:13:12,000 --> 07:13:13,440
I want to enjoy life.

10124
07:13:13,800 --> 07:13:14,900
I really do.

10125
07:13:15,320 --> 07:13:15,880
Yeah.

10126
07:13:16,980 --> 07:13:18,200
How about you, Otacon?

10127
07:13:19,060 --> 07:13:19,620
Me?

10128
07:13:22,020 --> 07:13:23,700
I feel like a new man.

10129
07:13:24,940 --> 07:13:27,540
Like how that implied that no one was listening to Naomi.

10130
07:13:27,860 --> 07:13:28,080
So what are you going to do?

10131
07:13:28,080 --> 07:13:28,760
Continue your research?

10132
07:13:29,280 --> 07:13:29,840
No.

10133
07:13:30,940 --> 07:13:33,460
Science and technology are fine, but...

10134
07:13:33,460 --> 07:13:34,520
The music is so whimsical.

10135
07:13:34,520 --> 07:13:35,400
What a whimsical...

10136
07:13:37,340 --> 07:13:38,300
Sounds good.

10137
07:13:39,660 --> 07:13:44,540
The whole reason I got into science in the first place was because I was no good with people.

10138
07:13:44,580 --> 07:13:46,640
I was scared of them.

10139
07:13:47,380 --> 07:13:49,020
I was scared of life.

10140
07:13:50,060 --> 07:13:53,840
I thought that I could never understand them because they're so illogical.

10141
07:13:55,100 --> 07:13:57,260
But I've finally learned how to like people.

10142
07:13:58,340 --> 07:14:00,640
There's no reason for me to be afraid anymore.

10143
07:14:02,280 --> 07:14:04,420
You and I are more alike than I thought.

10144
07:14:04,520 --> 07:14:05,340
Nooo!

10145
07:14:10,680 --> 07:14:12,060
You're so isomotical.

10146
07:14:14,000 --> 07:14:14,500
Yeah.

10147
07:14:23,020 --> 07:14:25,760
Yeah, I've seen this scene quite a few times.

10148
07:14:25,820 --> 07:14:26,300
It's so funny.

10149
07:14:27,840 --> 07:14:31,440
Oh god, I'm tears streaming down my face.

10150
07:14:37,120 --> 07:14:38,760
Oh god, I'm crying.

10151
07:14:38,880 --> 07:14:39,920
I'm laughing so hard.

10152
07:14:41,540 --> 07:14:42,660
Oh, I'm in.

10153
07:14:44,660 --> 07:14:46,020
Our new loves, though.

10154
07:14:46,520 --> 07:14:47,580
I'm in.

10155
07:14:48,700 --> 07:14:50,180
That's why Snake doesn't say anything.

10156
07:14:56,920 --> 07:14:59,160
Yeah, your driving was kind of, you know...

10157
07:15:05,300 --> 07:15:05,740
I'm in.

10158
07:15:07,060 --> 07:15:08,100
I'm Hal, Dave.

10159
07:15:08,840 --> 07:15:09,840
Oh, that's right.

10160
07:15:10,040 --> 07:15:10,380
Hal.

10161
07:15:11,180 --> 07:15:12,100
Hal and Dave.

10162
07:15:12,480 --> 07:15:13,260
That's a good one.

10163
07:15:17,020 --> 07:15:19,000
Maybe we should take a trip to Jupiter.

10164
07:15:20,320 --> 07:15:22,300
So, where are you going, Dave?

10165
07:15:22,420 --> 07:15:22,860
Oh god.

10166
07:15:24,900 --> 07:15:27,700
I think it's time for me to look for a new path in life.

10167
07:15:28,080 --> 07:15:29,020
A new path?

10168
07:15:29,640 --> 07:15:30,740
A new purpose.

10169
07:15:32,440 --> 07:15:33,420
Will you find it?

10170
07:15:34,540 --> 07:15:35,540
I'll find it.

10171
07:15:35,820 --> 07:15:37,180
I've already found it.

10172
07:15:37,660 --> 07:15:38,820
I know I'll find it.

10173
07:15:39,160 --> 07:15:41,480
Sorry, I'm freaking out over my own delusions.

10174
07:15:44,300 --> 07:15:46,380
I don't think I'm okay in the head.

10175
07:15:56,000 --> 07:15:56,980
God, I'm crying.

10176
07:15:59,880 --> 07:16:04,540
In the 1980s, there were more than 60,000 nuclear warheads in the world at all times.

10177
07:16:04,760 --> 07:16:09,240
The total destructive power amounted to one million times that of the Hiroshima A-bomb.

10178
07:16:09,240 --> 07:16:20,500
In January 1993, START II was signed and the United States and Russia agreed to reduce the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 3,000 to 3,500 in each nation by the end of the year 2007.

10179
07:16:20,820 --> 07:16:26,120
However, as of 2003, there still exist more than 20,000 nuclear warheads in the world.

10180
07:16:48,700 --> 07:16:50,460
Time to reveal my favorite theory.

10181
07:16:50,620 --> 07:16:53,520
The Twin Snakes is actually your retelling of the events of MGS.

10182
07:16:55,360 --> 07:16:58,160
Always a real treat to see you playing these games and sharing your passion.

10183
07:17:04,800 --> 07:17:06,880
This song brings back so many memories.

10184
07:17:18,320 --> 07:17:18,840
Yippee!

10185
07:17:21,120 --> 07:17:27,280
It was definitely not as dramatic as maybe the first time I played MGS1.

10186
07:17:28,800 --> 07:17:32,160
But I still had so much fun with this.

10187
07:17:34,180 --> 07:17:35,680
Congrats on finishing Twin Snakes!

10188
07:17:35,940 --> 07:17:37,060
PirateBug thanks for the 10 gifted!

10189
07:17:37,340 --> 07:17:37,780
Thank you!

10190
07:17:38,220 --> 07:17:40,200
It was an absolute riot experiencing it with you.

10191
07:17:40,240 --> 07:17:41,500
I'm so glad we got to see you stream it.

10192
07:17:41,560 --> 07:17:41,740
Yeah!

10193
07:17:41,920 --> 07:17:43,520
I'm so glad that I streamed it.

10194
07:17:58,270 --> 07:17:59,690
Can't hit the high notes right now.

10195
07:17:59,730 --> 07:18:00,690
My throat is still...

10196
07:18:06,910 --> 07:18:09,110
Almost no tension in the boss battles, unfortunately.

10197
07:18:09,510 --> 07:18:10,250
It's so funny.

10198
07:18:10,330 --> 07:18:11,670
The one that I struggled with the most...

10199
07:18:11,670 --> 07:18:12,990
The tank.

10200
07:18:13,930 --> 07:18:15,490
The tank of all things!

10201
07:18:17,750 --> 07:18:20,510
But yeah, in this it makes the boss battle so easy.

10202
07:18:23,870 --> 07:18:24,390
But...

10203
07:18:24,910 --> 07:18:30,470
I think it's also worth just playing because of the redone cutscenes and everything too.

10204
07:18:30,650 --> 07:18:32,830
Even though some of them I don't like as much.

10205
07:18:33,250 --> 07:18:33,730
But...

10206
07:18:33,730 --> 07:18:35,430
Thank you for finishing Twin Snakes, boss!

10207
07:18:35,730 --> 07:18:37,150
This is good, isn't it?

10208
07:18:37,250 --> 07:18:38,790
Don't make me cry anymore!

10209
07:18:41,670 --> 07:18:42,730
I'm gonna choose life too.

10210
07:18:42,870 --> 07:18:43,650
Yeah, sure thing.

10211
07:18:43,710 --> 07:18:45,310
Naomi, see you in MGS4!

10212
07:18:49,420 --> 07:18:50,210
So true!

10213
07:18:51,340 --> 07:18:51,710
Gosh.

10214
07:18:52,290 --> 07:18:53,490
Naomi, you!

10215
07:18:55,440 --> 07:18:56,530
Oh, so cute!

10216
07:18:57,530 --> 07:18:59,930
Oh, little meese.

10217
07:19:00,530 --> 07:19:01,770
Little wolf.

10218
07:19:02,470 --> 07:19:03,650
Oh, sniper wolf.

10219
07:19:04,330 --> 07:19:05,490
Little bears.

10220
07:19:07,710 --> 07:19:10,950
Some say Otacon is still falling to this day.

10221
07:19:14,910 --> 07:19:16,370
This song is so awesome.

10222
07:19:26,190 --> 07:19:27,530
Thank you for the five gifted.

10223
07:19:27,550 --> 07:19:27,970
Thank you!

10224
07:19:28,090 --> 07:19:29,030
Sorry if I said your name wrong.

10225
07:19:34,290 --> 07:19:34,690
I

10226
07:19:43,640 --> 07:19:44,520
don't know the words.

10227
07:19:44,740 --> 07:19:45,380
It's not...

10228
07:19:46,260 --> 07:19:47,260
What's the language again?

10229
07:19:47,300 --> 07:19:47,620
I'm not sure.

10230
07:19:47,760 --> 07:19:49,180
Thank you for the Aqua Sofa!

10231
07:19:51,080 --> 07:19:51,480
No.

10232
07:19:52,240 --> 07:19:55,700
Just found the director of Godzilla Final War and made all the cutscenes for this game.

10233
07:19:55,760 --> 07:19:57,580
No wonder why Snake kept doing the Matrix only.

10234
07:19:57,800 --> 07:19:58,480
Yeah, exactly.

10235
07:19:59,240 --> 07:20:00,460
Thanks for getting another wild ride.

10236
07:20:00,520 --> 07:20:01,320
Congrats on beating the game.

10237
07:20:01,400 --> 07:20:03,100
Thank you for the Aqua Sofa!

10238
07:20:03,860 --> 07:20:04,220
Down!

10239
07:20:04,300 --> 07:20:05,340
Thank you for the 30 gifted.

10240
07:20:05,440 --> 07:20:06,040
Thank you so much.

10241
07:20:06,260 --> 07:20:06,620
Gaelic!

10242
07:20:07,460 --> 07:20:07,960
Gaelic, yeah.

10243
07:20:08,420 --> 07:20:09,140
Or Celtic.

10244
07:20:09,200 --> 07:20:09,620
Which is it?

10245
07:20:10,100 --> 07:20:10,460
Celtic?

10246
07:20:13,040 --> 07:20:16,140
Glad you have joined MGS Matrix Edition.

10247
07:20:16,920 --> 07:20:18,180
Welcome back from Outer Heaven.

10248
07:20:18,400 --> 07:20:19,060
Thank you!

10249
07:20:20,380 --> 07:20:21,320
Thank you.

10250
07:20:22,880 --> 07:20:23,860
Oh, man.

10251
07:20:38,680 --> 07:20:39,160
Shirakuma!

10252
07:20:39,500 --> 07:20:40,560
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

10253
07:20:41,100 --> 07:20:46,180
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

10254
07:20:46,180 --> 07:20:47,400
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

10255
07:20:47,560 --> 07:20:47,900
Thank you.

10256
07:20:48,160 --> 07:20:52,320
Of course we have to wait for the ending.

10257
07:20:52,680 --> 07:20:53,120
Oh!

10258
07:20:53,140 --> 07:20:54,000
Zone of the Enders!

10259
07:20:59,200 --> 07:21:00,160
Thank you.

10260
07:21:01,280 --> 07:21:04,240
It's fun seeing you experience something that was both familiar and different.

10261
07:21:04,500 --> 07:21:04,780
Right?

10262
07:21:05,920 --> 07:21:08,740
Can't wait to see what other Metal Gear shenanigans you might have in the future.

10263
07:21:08,980 --> 07:21:09,420
Replays?

10264
07:21:09,440 --> 07:21:10,200
Delta Acid?

10265
07:21:10,300 --> 07:21:10,820
Monkeys?

10266
07:21:11,080 --> 07:21:11,500
Smash?

10267
07:21:11,560 --> 07:21:12,480
A lot of possibilities.

10268
07:21:13,020 --> 07:21:13,520
Yeah.

10269
07:21:15,660 --> 07:21:16,180
Yeah.

10270
07:21:18,020 --> 07:21:19,000
I gotta...

10271
07:21:19,520 --> 07:21:20,400
I gotta...

10272
07:21:20,400 --> 07:21:21,940
I gotta hold my titles.

10273
07:21:22,320 --> 07:21:23,880
The Metal Gear VTuber.

10274
07:21:24,000 --> 07:21:25,140
Or maybe reclaim it.

10275
07:21:28,940 --> 07:21:29,860
Yanwei, thank you.

10276
07:21:30,100 --> 07:21:31,260
Have you seen Mitchell Hammond's...

10277
07:21:31,260 --> 07:21:32,900
Metal Gear MSX animations?

10278
07:21:36,240 --> 07:21:40,080
As of 2023, there are 12,512 nuclear warheads.

10279
07:21:40,380 --> 07:21:40,940
Okay.

10280
07:21:42,280 --> 07:21:43,620
That could be less.

10281
07:21:45,020 --> 07:21:46,940
They wanted 3,000, but...

10282
07:21:48,020 --> 07:21:49,200
You know.

10283
07:21:49,760 --> 07:21:51,100
Congrats on finishing the...

10284
07:21:51,100 --> 07:21:51,800
Thank you, Maya!

10285
07:21:53,900 --> 07:21:54,540
Yeah.

10286
07:21:56,200 --> 07:21:56,520
Yeah.

10287
07:21:58,100 --> 07:21:58,540
Yeah.

10288
07:21:59,980 --> 07:22:02,240
A VTuber to surpass Metal Gear.

10289
07:22:03,560 --> 07:22:06,220
I'm so glad I could return to MGS1, Twin Snakes.

10290
07:22:06,460 --> 07:22:06,980
But...

10291
07:22:07,520 --> 07:22:09,180
You mustn't allow yourself to be chained to fate.

10292
07:22:09,180 --> 07:22:09,620
God, sorry.

10293
07:22:10,360 --> 07:22:12,080
To be ruled by your genes.

10294
07:22:13,440 --> 07:22:15,740
Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.

10295
07:22:15,740 --> 07:22:17,400
She always has to have the last line.

10296
07:22:17,660 --> 07:22:18,140
Snake.

10297
07:22:18,680 --> 07:22:22,200
She thinks she's the main character when Ocelot is the main character.

10298
07:22:22,900 --> 07:22:24,560
The important thing is that you choose life.

10299
07:22:24,560 --> 07:22:25,260
And then Meryl died.

10300
07:22:25,360 --> 07:22:27,920
Meryl walks in to grab a coffee, side-eyes Otacon.

10301
07:22:27,980 --> 07:22:28,500
And then...

10302
07:22:28,500 --> 07:22:28,520
And then...

10303
07:22:28,520 --> 07:22:31,360
I think we're the pink.

10304
07:22:31,640 --> 07:22:32,360
Just live.

10305
07:22:32,660 --> 07:22:33,480
Yes, sir.

10306
07:22:34,080 --> 07:22:36,680
The entire unit was wiped out.

10307
07:22:38,040 --> 07:22:38,640
Yes.

10308
07:22:39,500 --> 07:22:40,460
Yes, sir.

10309
07:22:41,100 --> 07:22:41,860
Yes, sir.

10310
07:22:41,860 --> 07:22:42,300
Thanks for the vaccine.

10311
07:22:43,000 --> 07:22:44,000
Yes, sir.

10312
07:22:44,120 --> 07:22:44,500
Yes.

10313
07:22:44,720 --> 07:22:46,420
Those two are still alive.

10314
07:22:46,660 --> 07:22:47,620
Yes, sir.

10315
07:22:48,060 --> 07:22:48,560
The vector.

10316
07:22:49,220 --> 07:22:50,120
Yes, sir.

10317
07:22:50,300 --> 07:22:51,180
Yes, sir.

10318
07:22:51,260 --> 07:22:52,440
The bactite should be come activated soon.

10319
07:22:52,840 --> 07:22:54,140
Right on schedule.

10320
07:22:56,340 --> 07:22:57,300
Yes, sir.

10321
07:22:57,440 --> 07:22:58,180
Yes, sir.

10322
07:22:58,260 --> 07:22:58,500
I read a letter.

10323
07:23:02,280 --> 07:23:03,420
Yes, sir.

10324
07:23:03,480 --> 07:23:04,820
No, sir.

10325
07:23:07,520 --> 07:23:09,380
No, sir.

10326
07:23:09,560 --> 07:23:10,080
Yes.

10327
07:23:10,320 --> 07:23:10,840
Oh, no, sir.

10328
07:23:15,500 --> 07:23:16,880
Yes, sir.

10329
07:23:17,240 --> 07:23:17,960
Yes, sir.

10330
07:23:24,200 --> 07:23:24,920
Yes.

10331
07:23:25,040 --> 07:23:25,760
Yes.

10332
07:23:26,560 --> 07:23:27,920
Liquid is dead.

10333
07:23:28,520 --> 07:23:31,220
The inferior one was the winner after all.

10334
07:23:31,540 --> 07:23:32,980
We were the inferior one?

10335
07:23:32,980 --> 07:23:33,280
That's right.

10336
07:23:34,180 --> 07:23:34,700
What?

10337
07:23:35,820 --> 07:23:37,720
He was the inferior one?

10338
07:23:38,200 --> 07:23:40,440
Of course, the other one thinks so, too.

10339
07:23:41,680 --> 07:23:42,660
Yes, sir.

10340
07:23:42,980 --> 07:23:44,080
I agree completely.

10341
07:23:44,480 --> 07:23:49,100
It takes a well-balanced individual such as yourself to rule the world.

10342
07:23:49,680 --> 07:23:50,540
No, sir.

10343
07:23:50,960 --> 07:23:51,280
Yes.

10344
07:23:51,320 --> 07:23:52,380
No, yes, sir.

10345
07:23:52,460 --> 07:23:52,780
Yes, sir.

10346
07:23:54,620 --> 07:23:55,500
No, sir.

10347
07:23:55,560 --> 07:23:56,340
No, sir.

10348
07:23:56,340 --> 07:23:57,120
Dang it, I missed it.

10349
07:23:57,200 --> 07:23:58,180
No one knows that you were the third one.

10350
07:23:59,020 --> 07:23:59,700
Solidus.

10351
07:24:00,240 --> 07:24:00,920
Solidus?

10352
07:24:01,260 --> 07:24:03,040
What should I do about the woman?

10353
07:24:03,500 --> 07:24:03,960
Wait, what?

10354
07:24:06,300 --> 07:24:07,260
Yes, sir.

10355
07:24:07,480 --> 07:24:08,300
Yes, sir.

10356
07:24:08,860 --> 07:24:10,340
The surveillance will continue.

10357
07:24:12,540 --> 07:24:13,220
Yes.

10358
07:24:13,540 --> 07:24:14,260
Yes, sir.

10359
07:24:14,400 --> 07:24:14,800
Yes.

10360
07:24:15,300 --> 07:24:16,240
Thank you.

10361
07:24:16,380 --> 07:24:17,900
Mr. President.

10362
07:24:18,180 --> 07:24:19,420
Goodbye, Mr. President.

10363
07:24:19,860 --> 07:24:21,300
Dun-dun.

10364
07:24:32,760 --> 07:24:33,440
Yippee.

10365
07:24:35,400 --> 07:24:38,440
By the way, Vinny Vinesauce knows that you know about...

10366
07:24:38,440 --> 07:24:40,920
Wait, what do you mean he knows that I know about the Diver Chief?

10367
07:24:42,500 --> 07:24:43,660
What do you mean by that?

10368
07:24:44,360 --> 07:24:45,800
Oh, there's a whole link and everything.

10369
07:24:47,760 --> 07:24:48,520
Yes, sir.

10370
07:24:48,860 --> 07:24:49,640
Clear code.

10371
07:24:50,040 --> 07:24:51,320
My code is hyena.

10372
07:24:51,480 --> 07:24:52,420
What's hyena mean?

10373
07:24:53,420 --> 07:24:54,300
I got stealth.

10374
07:24:56,080 --> 07:24:56,560
Save.

10375
07:24:56,740 --> 07:24:57,560
Yeah, we'll save.

10376
07:24:58,620 --> 07:24:59,380
Yes, sir.

10377
07:25:00,900 --> 07:25:01,800
Yes, sir.

10378
07:25:02,140 --> 07:25:02,920
No, sir.

10379
07:25:02,920 --> 07:25:03,040
No, sir.

10380
07:25:04,940 --> 07:25:07,120
He reacted to a chat message about it.

10381
07:25:07,220 --> 07:25:08,160
Oh, wait, what?

10382
07:25:09,220 --> 07:25:10,120
No way.

10383
07:25:12,520 --> 07:25:13,340
Yes, sir.

10384
07:25:14,360 --> 07:25:15,280
No, sir.

10385
07:25:17,200 --> 07:25:18,040
Yes, sir.

10386
07:25:20,300 --> 07:25:21,900
Oh, that was so fun.

10387
07:25:25,140 --> 07:25:26,240
That was so fun.

10388
07:25:28,080 --> 07:25:29,800
Ocelot doing a mega try-depression.

10389
07:25:29,800 --> 07:25:31,440
Oh, impersonation, yeah.

10390
07:25:37,820 --> 07:25:41,440
I always go on about it, but Game Boy Metal Gear is essentially a Metal Gear 3.

10391
07:25:41,960 --> 07:25:45,540
And Acid 1 is the game that is the closet... closet?

10392
07:25:45,840 --> 07:25:46,220
Closest?

10393
07:25:46,220 --> 07:25:49,800
Oh, closest to an MGS1 sequel vibes-wise.

10394
07:25:52,620 --> 07:25:54,600
I don't know about a sequel.

10395
07:25:56,820 --> 07:25:58,320
It's really weird.

10396
07:25:59,860 --> 07:26:01,840
Code Hyena means pretty good.

10397
07:26:02,000 --> 07:26:03,200
Oh my gosh, Romper Rambit!

10398
07:26:03,260 --> 07:26:04,060
You can sing!

10399
07:26:05,240 --> 07:26:06,620
You can sing!

10400
07:26:06,760 --> 07:26:07,380
Holy cow!

10401
07:26:10,260 --> 07:26:11,660
I was watching your videos.

10402
07:26:13,240 --> 07:26:14,680
You sing so well.

10403
07:26:22,500 --> 07:26:24,400
Hyena is an anagram of Henya.

10404
07:26:24,620 --> 07:26:25,640
It was meant to be.

10405
07:26:28,100 --> 07:26:29,000
Yeah, he can.

10406
07:26:29,100 --> 07:26:29,300
Yeah!

10407
07:26:30,480 --> 07:26:32,260
Congratulations on clearing the game!

10408
07:26:33,320 --> 07:26:34,480
Thank you!

10409
07:26:37,560 --> 07:26:38,520
There we go.

10410
07:26:39,380 --> 07:26:44,240
Okay, I don't want to wear out my CD so much, but...

10411
07:26:44,880 --> 07:26:45,680
Thank you.

10412
07:26:46,080 --> 07:26:47,800
Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes?

10413
07:26:49,520 --> 07:26:51,220
It was an honor?

10414
07:26:53,940 --> 07:26:55,840
Wait, let's see the special real quick.

10415
07:26:56,260 --> 07:26:56,840
Oh!

10416
07:26:57,520 --> 07:26:59,640
I never got a camera.

10417
07:27:01,040 --> 07:27:02,580
How do I get the camera?

10418
07:27:03,000 --> 07:27:03,600
Hmm...

10419
07:27:03,600 --> 07:27:05,200
Boss Survival?

10420
07:27:05,860 --> 07:27:07,320
Oh, cool!

10421
07:27:07,580 --> 07:27:08,520
Previous Operations?

10422
07:27:10,260 --> 07:27:10,940
What?

10423
07:27:14,740 --> 07:27:15,760
Emo Theater?

10424
07:27:16,520 --> 07:27:17,620
Otacon Chapter?

10425
07:27:19,160 --> 07:27:19,500
Wait.

10426
07:27:27,580 --> 07:27:29,740
Wait, does it have the MSX games on here?

10427
07:27:29,820 --> 07:27:30,360
I had no idea.

10428
07:27:39,330 --> 07:27:40,410
They're definitely going to have the MSX games on here.

10429
07:27:40,410 --> 07:27:40,590
That's really weird.

10430
07:27:41,950 --> 07:27:44,070
But the juice is worth the squeeze.

10431
07:27:46,530 --> 07:27:48,190
Oh my god, there's so many that we never got.

10432
07:27:50,690 --> 07:27:52,210
Okay, I have to press manually.

10433
07:27:52,470 --> 07:27:53,110
Go, go.

10434
07:27:53,530 --> 07:27:53,890
Wait.

10435
07:27:53,930 --> 07:27:54,170
Wait.

10436
07:27:56,370 --> 07:27:57,050
Oh, wait.

10437
07:27:57,450 --> 07:27:57,810
Normal?

10438
07:27:58,070 --> 07:27:58,550
There we go.

10439
07:28:01,150 --> 07:28:01,510
Oh!

10440
07:28:01,610 --> 07:28:01,930
Oh!

10441
07:28:01,930 --> 07:28:02,470
There, there, there, there!

10442
07:28:11,180 --> 07:28:11,540
Hmm.

10443
07:28:15,740 --> 07:28:16,580
There's only 28.

10444
07:28:18,880 --> 07:28:19,460
But, if you want to get the MSX, you have to get the MSX.

10445
07:28:19,460 --> 07:28:21,460
Okay, the viewer is literally nothing.

10446
07:28:22,460 --> 07:28:25,480
Maybe because we don't have their date of birth or anything.

10447
07:28:25,940 --> 07:28:26,840
It's kind of lame.

10448
07:28:27,460 --> 07:28:28,340
Okay, never mind.

10449
07:28:31,340 --> 07:28:32,340
That's all it is?

10450
07:28:33,340 --> 07:28:35,060
Okay, I'm going to test this real quick.

10451
07:28:35,940 --> 07:28:36,460
Oh!

10452
07:28:38,680 --> 07:28:40,720
We got baited so hard.

10453
07:28:40,900 --> 07:28:41,820
It's just a summary.

10454
07:28:43,380 --> 07:28:45,420
We got baited so hard.

10455
07:28:48,220 --> 07:28:48,740
Wait.

10456
07:28:49,780 --> 07:28:50,420
Oh my god!

10457
07:28:50,480 --> 07:28:52,640
Look at Young Snake in the back!

10458
07:28:53,980 --> 07:28:54,760
Look at him!

10459
07:28:54,760 --> 07:28:55,540
He's so baby!

10460
07:28:58,120 --> 07:28:58,960
We got baited.

10461
07:28:59,580 --> 07:29:00,500
We got baited.

10462
07:29:00,640 --> 07:29:01,080
We got baited.

10463
07:29:01,560 --> 07:29:02,400
He's a baby!

10464
07:29:16,340 --> 07:29:16,720
Cool.

10465
07:29:18,620 --> 07:29:19,000
Welp.

10466
07:29:19,440 --> 07:29:21,880
Okay, I'm going to turn off my GameCube now.

10467
07:29:24,400 --> 07:29:25,140
Actually, hold on.

10468
07:29:25,160 --> 07:29:25,560
Give me a second.

10469
07:29:25,680 --> 07:29:27,020
We're going to move over to...

10470
07:29:27,420 --> 07:29:28,280
What the heck?

10471
07:29:29,320 --> 07:29:30,240
Oh, never mind.

10472
07:29:31,340 --> 07:29:32,060
Give me a second.

10473
07:29:33,900 --> 07:29:34,720
Here we go.

10474
07:29:34,900 --> 07:29:35,480
There we go.

10475
07:29:38,620 --> 07:29:40,260
Oh, and you can't hear anymore.

10476
07:29:41,220 --> 07:29:42,020
And off!

10477
07:29:42,600 --> 07:29:43,340
There we go.

10478
07:29:43,580 --> 07:29:44,480
Turn it off.

10479
07:29:44,580 --> 07:29:45,060
Turn it off.

10480
07:29:47,980 --> 07:29:49,800
Let me put on some...

10481
07:29:49,800 --> 07:29:51,320
Oh, that's not what I wanted to do.

10482
07:29:51,460 --> 07:29:51,800
Oh wait.

10483
07:29:51,920 --> 07:29:52,700
Did I mess it up?

10484
07:29:54,320 --> 07:29:55,360
It's mostly fine.

10485
07:29:57,580 --> 07:29:58,860
Sometimes if I put it on...

10486
07:29:58,860 --> 07:29:59,840
the wrong way...

10487
07:29:59,840 --> 07:30:01,980
it sticks to my bangs instead...

10488
07:30:01,980 --> 07:30:03,080
and it becomes weird.

10489
07:30:04,940 --> 07:30:05,460
The...

10490
07:30:05,460 --> 07:30:06,080
Oh, wait.

10491
07:30:06,140 --> 07:30:07,000
Stop it!

10492
07:30:15,660 --> 07:30:19,260
There was a Japanese collector's console bundle for this...

10493
07:30:19,260 --> 07:30:21,660
which comes with NES Metal Gear on a separate disc.

10494
07:30:21,760 --> 07:30:21,900
Oh!

10495
07:30:23,440 --> 07:30:24,520
That's so awesome.

10496
07:30:24,720 --> 07:30:24,920
What?

10497
07:30:25,920 --> 07:30:27,840
Let me get some music real quick, you guys.

10498
07:30:27,840 --> 07:30:29,020
Give me a second.

10499
07:30:41,860 --> 07:30:43,400
I feel so...

10500
07:30:44,620 --> 07:30:45,660
so good.

10501
07:30:46,720 --> 07:30:48,540
I feel so good.

10502
07:30:49,740 --> 07:30:51,060
That was so much fun.

10503
07:30:52,240 --> 07:30:54,540
Even if the bosses aren't...

10504
07:30:54,540 --> 07:30:55,200
like...

10505
07:30:56,000 --> 07:30:57,280
super difficult...

10506
07:30:57,280 --> 07:30:58,580
it's still a lot of fun.

10507
07:31:00,000 --> 07:31:02,000
It also makes you feel good...

10508
07:31:02,000 --> 07:31:03,220
when you're just like...

10509
07:31:03,220 --> 07:31:04,280
Yeah, I can beat it easily.

10510
07:31:05,640 --> 07:31:08,520
Any chance of the Zone of the Enders playthrough at some point, boss?

10511
07:31:09,340 --> 07:31:10,620
To the series near and dear to...

10512
07:31:10,620 --> 07:31:11,060
close to...

10513
07:31:11,060 --> 07:31:11,560
near...

10514
07:31:11,560 --> 07:31:12,040
dear...

10515
07:31:12,040 --> 07:31:12,520
and dear...

10516
07:31:12,520 --> 07:31:13,680
to my heart...

10517
07:31:13,680 --> 07:31:15,520
for being my introduction to Kojima-san.

10518
07:31:15,760 --> 07:31:16,240
Um...

10519
07:31:16,240 --> 07:31:17,340
I would like to.

10520
07:31:18,240 --> 07:31:18,720
So...

10521
07:31:20,060 --> 07:31:20,540
Um...

10522
07:31:21,180 --> 07:31:22,140
It's not like a...

10523
07:31:22,780 --> 07:31:23,400
It's a...

10524
07:31:23,400 --> 07:31:23,900
It's a...

10525
07:31:23,900 --> 07:31:24,460
It's an eventually.

10526
07:31:24,840 --> 07:31:25,900
So, yes...

10527
07:31:25,900 --> 07:31:26,960
but I don't know when.

10528
07:31:27,800 --> 07:31:28,740
Just a...

10529
07:31:28,740 --> 07:31:29,980
an eventually.

10530
07:31:30,280 --> 07:31:31,480
The Ocelite fight...

10531
07:31:31,480 --> 07:31:32,880
fight was so much easier.

10532
07:31:32,880 --> 07:31:34,880
Every fight was so much easier.

10533
07:31:35,000 --> 07:31:35,680
It was so funny.

10534
07:31:36,080 --> 07:31:38,000
And I couldn't get the cheese for...

10535
07:31:38,000 --> 07:31:39,300
quite a few of them, but...

10536
07:31:39,300 --> 07:31:40,620
we kind of cheesed...

10537
07:31:41,320 --> 07:31:41,880
Raven.

10538
07:31:42,340 --> 07:31:43,160
Vulcan Raven.

10539
07:31:45,640 --> 07:31:46,200
Yeah.

10540
07:31:47,240 --> 07:31:48,380
So much fun.

10541
07:31:55,060 --> 07:31:56,300
What did you guys think?

10542
07:31:56,760 --> 07:31:57,540
Did you guys like it?

10543
07:32:00,240 --> 07:32:01,560
Try Ghost Babble.

10544
07:32:01,740 --> 07:32:02,120
I...

10545
07:32:02,980 --> 07:32:03,760
want to.

10546
07:32:05,300 --> 07:32:06,120
I do...

10547
07:32:06,120 --> 07:32:06,560
I do...

10548
07:32:07,420 --> 07:32:07,560
Hello?

10549
07:32:07,780 --> 07:32:08,860
Why do I keep breathing?

10550
07:32:09,200 --> 07:32:09,580
Uh-oh.

10551
07:32:09,780 --> 07:32:10,440
Uh-oh.

10552
07:32:11,060 --> 07:32:11,920
Everything okay?

10553
07:32:12,160 --> 07:32:12,720
Might need to...

10554
07:32:12,720 --> 07:32:15,000
Might need to let my computer rest a little bit today.

10555
07:32:15,500 --> 07:32:17,480
I'm just now becoming a fan.

10556
07:32:17,780 --> 07:32:18,380
Hi, Kyle.

10557
07:32:19,300 --> 07:32:23,000
Congratulations for getting this ending between the original MGS and this game.

10558
07:32:23,120 --> 07:32:24,500
Yeah, I'd really choose the former.

10559
07:32:24,800 --> 07:32:27,400
On your time, look up Metal Gear Stereo TV.

10560
07:32:27,680 --> 07:32:28,160
See you then.

10561
07:32:28,300 --> 07:32:28,920
Thanks, Kyle.

10562
07:32:29,160 --> 07:32:30,280
Thank you for the pink.

10563
07:32:31,740 --> 07:32:32,580
Just BEC.

10564
07:32:32,800 --> 07:32:33,820
Oh, look at the membership.

10565
07:32:34,020 --> 07:32:34,620
Thank you.

10566
07:32:37,920 --> 07:32:38,400
Um...

10567
07:32:38,400 --> 07:32:38,940
Oh my gosh.

10568
07:32:38,960 --> 07:32:39,820
Why do I keep freezing?

10569
07:32:40,160 --> 07:32:40,920
What's going on?

10570
07:32:41,340 --> 07:32:41,540
Eh?

10571
07:32:41,760 --> 07:32:42,240
Eh?

10572
07:32:42,400 --> 07:32:42,800
Eh?

10573
07:32:43,020 --> 07:32:43,440
Eh?

10574
07:32:43,600 --> 07:32:44,020
Eh?

10575
07:32:44,220 --> 07:32:44,680
Eh?

10576
07:32:44,920 --> 07:32:45,080
Eh?

10577
07:32:45,080 --> 07:32:45,180
Eh?

10578
07:32:45,400 --> 07:32:45,760
Eh?

10579
07:32:46,440 --> 07:32:46,900
Eh?

10580
07:32:54,340 --> 07:32:54,820
Eh?

10581
07:32:55,160 --> 07:32:55,640
Eh?

10582
07:32:55,940 --> 07:32:56,120
Eh?

10583
07:32:56,240 --> 07:32:56,720
Eh?

10584
07:32:56,840 --> 07:32:56,920
Eh?

10585
07:32:57,040 --> 07:32:57,520
Eh?

10586
07:32:57,700 --> 07:32:57,920
Eh?

10587
07:32:57,920 --> 07:32:58,220
Eh?

10588
07:33:00,020 --> 07:33:00,500
Eh?

10589
07:33:00,500 --> 07:33:00,580
Oh.

10590
07:33:03,890 --> 07:33:04,690
I'm frozen.

10591
07:33:05,430 --> 07:33:06,150
Hold on.

10592
07:33:06,170 --> 07:33:06,650
Give me a second.

10593
07:33:08,250 --> 07:33:09,210
I'm gonna disappear.

10594
07:33:11,350 --> 07:33:12,450
I think maybe...

10595
07:33:14,110 --> 07:33:16,990
my webcam is overheating.

10596
07:33:18,110 --> 07:33:18,670
Okay.

10597
07:33:24,690 --> 07:33:26,250
It might be overheating.

10598
07:33:28,990 --> 07:33:29,550
Uh...

10599
07:33:29,550 --> 07:33:30,590
Oh, wait.

10600
07:33:30,630 --> 07:33:30,910
Hold on.

10601
07:33:40,320 --> 07:33:40,980
I'm here.

10602
07:33:42,280 --> 07:33:42,640
I'm here.

10603
07:33:42,760 --> 07:33:43,240
I'm a ghost.

10604
07:33:43,280 --> 07:33:45,380
I can just poof in and out of existence, you know?

10605
07:33:46,380 --> 07:33:48,760
I can poof in and out of existence.

10606
07:33:51,780 --> 07:33:54,540
I actually got really lucky with this because, um...

10607
07:33:55,320 --> 07:33:56,920
I was like, you know...

10608
07:33:56,920 --> 07:33:57,940
I was like, I'm gonna come back.

10609
07:33:59,640 --> 07:34:00,080
But...

10610
07:34:01,560 --> 07:34:05,180
In the past, I used my giant iPad.

10611
07:34:06,740 --> 07:34:07,820
But I was like...

10612
07:34:07,820 --> 07:34:11,340
I don't really have room for my iPad on my desk.

10613
07:34:11,340 --> 07:34:12,480
I don't know what to do.

10614
07:34:12,860 --> 07:34:15,120
And then, my friend was just like...

10615
07:34:15,120 --> 07:34:16,120
Well, actually, I have a...

10616
07:34:16,120 --> 07:34:18,980
I have an iPhone that I can sell to you.

10617
07:34:21,220 --> 07:34:22,580
Thank you for the five gift.

10618
07:34:22,660 --> 07:34:23,140
Thank you.

10619
07:34:24,960 --> 07:34:25,400
Um...

10620
07:34:25,400 --> 07:34:26,560
And it's an older...

10621
07:34:26,560 --> 07:34:27,620
It's an older iPhone.

10622
07:34:28,060 --> 07:34:30,820
They bought it because they thought that, um...

10623
07:34:31,340 --> 07:34:32,280
Well, not they thought.

10624
07:34:32,440 --> 07:34:32,960
Well, yes.

10625
07:34:33,200 --> 07:34:33,640
They...

10626
07:34:34,180 --> 07:34:35,920
They thought that they had lost their phone.

10627
07:34:36,680 --> 07:34:37,900
And so, they bought it.

10628
07:34:38,320 --> 07:34:40,300
And then, they ended up not needing it.

10629
07:34:40,840 --> 07:34:42,320
So, super-duper lucky.

10630
07:34:44,600 --> 07:34:45,080
Yeah.

10631
07:34:48,780 --> 07:34:49,260
So...

10632
07:34:49,820 --> 07:34:50,680
I was like...

10633
07:34:50,680 --> 07:34:53,060
Otherwise, I would have had to probably buy like a whole new phone.

10634
07:34:54,400 --> 07:34:55,520
How old is old?

10635
07:34:55,660 --> 07:34:57,360
Is it 10X?

10636
07:34:59,640 --> 07:35:04,100
I think it's the first phone that introduced like the...

10637
07:35:05,140 --> 07:35:05,620
The...

10638
07:35:06,300 --> 07:35:08,160
The better stuff for VTubing.

10639
07:35:08,880 --> 07:35:09,360
Hmm.

10640
07:35:12,110 --> 07:35:12,530
Yeah.

10641
07:35:12,610 --> 07:35:13,810
It's the first one with tracking.

10642
07:35:14,070 --> 07:35:14,210
Yeah.

10643
07:35:14,290 --> 07:35:14,490
Yeah.

10644
07:35:14,530 --> 07:35:14,730
Yeah.

10645
07:35:15,550 --> 07:35:15,970
So...

10646
07:35:15,970 --> 07:35:18,250
It ended up working out really well.

10647
07:35:18,690 --> 07:35:19,110
Hmm.

10648
07:35:20,670 --> 07:35:21,090
Yeah.

10649
07:35:21,250 --> 07:35:21,470
Yeah.

10650
07:35:22,570 --> 07:35:22,990
Hmm.

10651
07:35:23,090 --> 07:35:23,430
Hmm.

10652
07:35:23,510 --> 07:35:23,890
Hmm.

10653
07:35:23,890 --> 07:35:24,190
Hmm.

10654
07:35:24,190 --> 07:35:24,390
Hmm.

10655
07:35:24,450 --> 07:35:24,710
Hmm.

10656
07:35:24,710 --> 07:35:24,910
Hmm.

10657
07:35:24,910 --> 07:35:24,990
Hmm.

10658
07:35:24,990 --> 07:35:25,030
Hmm.

10659
07:35:25,030 --> 07:35:25,250
Hmm.

10660
07:35:25,430 --> 07:35:25,610
Hmm.

10661
07:35:25,810 --> 07:35:26,130
Hmm.

10662
07:35:26,130 --> 07:35:26,150
Hmm.

10663
07:35:26,630 --> 07:35:26,730
Yeah.

10664
07:35:26,730 --> 07:35:27,730
I think it's the iPhone X.

10665
07:35:28,890 --> 07:35:29,410
X.

10666
07:35:31,350 --> 07:35:32,630
2017 isn't retro.

10667
07:35:32,810 --> 07:35:33,770
It's still new, right?

10668
07:35:34,130 --> 07:35:34,650
Yeah.

10669
07:35:35,450 --> 07:35:36,330
Still new.

10670
07:35:37,230 --> 07:35:38,830
Thank you for this interesting...

10671
07:35:38,830 --> 07:35:39,710
Oh, sorry.

10672
07:35:39,830 --> 07:35:40,410
In-testing.

10673
07:35:40,510 --> 07:35:41,150
No, I'm just kidding.

10674
07:35:41,530 --> 07:35:44,670
Experience with MGS and teaching me love can bloom on the...

10675
07:35:44,670 --> 07:35:45,350
In the battlefield.

10676
07:35:45,810 --> 07:35:46,530
Mia-chan.

10677
07:35:46,650 --> 07:35:47,310
Thank you.

10678
07:35:49,930 --> 07:35:51,230
100% can bloom.

10679
07:35:51,630 --> 07:35:53,030
We're a sting glitch face.

10680
07:35:53,110 --> 07:35:54,030
Thanks for the five.

10681
07:35:58,350 --> 07:36:06,310
I think... I don't know if maybe now more recent... I don't know.

10682
07:36:07,650 --> 07:36:13,610
If more recent... Android phones can be used.

10683
07:36:14,450 --> 07:36:15,730
I'm not sure to be honest.

10684
07:36:18,470 --> 07:36:20,210
This is all still new to me.

10685
07:36:21,910 --> 07:36:22,350
Paperbacks!

10686
07:36:22,410 --> 07:36:23,210
Thanks for the five gifted.

10687
07:36:23,310 --> 07:36:23,830
Thank you!

10688
07:36:29,250 --> 07:36:31,830
Hey boss, I'm here to remind you to talk to your Kamiyoshi.

10689
07:36:32,150 --> 07:36:33,470
I have!

10690
07:36:35,830 --> 07:36:36,710
In fact...

10691
07:36:37,870 --> 07:36:38,310
Now...

10692
07:36:39,530 --> 07:36:40,530
I'm not gonna say.

10693
07:36:47,660 --> 07:36:48,720
I'm not gonna say.

10694
07:36:54,430 --> 07:36:56,310
But I saw like a clip...

10695
07:36:57,030 --> 07:36:58,230
Where she was like...

10696
07:36:59,910 --> 07:37:01,630
If Mint wants to collab with me...

10697
07:37:01,630 --> 07:37:02,870
She has to suffer.

10698
07:37:05,970 --> 07:37:07,070
What does that mean?

10699
07:37:09,910 --> 07:37:10,250
Awesome!

10700
07:37:12,430 --> 07:37:13,590
Yes sir!

10701
07:37:15,770 --> 07:37:16,430
Yes sir!

10702
07:37:16,770 --> 07:37:18,070
What is that game?

10703
07:37:22,000 --> 07:37:23,360
What is that game?

10704
07:37:24,060 --> 07:37:25,300
And he has an S.

10705
07:37:26,560 --> 07:37:27,540
No sir!

10706
07:37:31,800 --> 07:37:32,640
Sisyphus game?

10707
07:37:33,440 --> 07:37:34,340
What's it called?

10708
07:37:34,600 --> 07:37:35,280
Is it on Steam?

10709
07:37:36,380 --> 07:37:37,520
I'm looking for it.

10710
07:37:40,360 --> 07:37:41,260
What's it called?

10711
07:37:43,580 --> 07:37:44,140
Sisyphus...

10712
07:37:44,140 --> 07:37:45,620
Oh the game of Sisyphus?

10713
07:37:47,400 --> 07:37:49,520
Roll the boulder to the top.

10714
07:37:52,260 --> 07:37:53,700
Oh this looks like...

10715
07:37:55,660 --> 07:37:56,220
Like...

10716
07:37:56,220 --> 07:37:57,360
Real shit game.

10717
07:37:58,740 --> 07:38:00,100
Oh...

10718
07:38:02,100 --> 07:38:02,780
Oh...

10719
07:38:02,780 --> 07:38:05,220
Oh no...

10720
07:38:06,100 --> 07:38:06,780
Um...

10721
07:38:06,780 --> 07:38:09,760
If I have to play it...

10722
07:38:10,900 --> 07:38:12,260
The um...

10723
07:38:15,180 --> 07:38:16,260
If I...

10724
07:38:18,840 --> 07:38:22,680
To collab with her...

10725
07:38:28,640 --> 07:38:29,080
No...

10726
07:38:29,080 --> 07:38:29,100
No...

10727
07:38:32,700 --> 07:38:33,140
Sisyphus...

10728
07:38:33,140 --> 07:38:34,360
The first one is difficult.

10729
07:38:35,060 --> 07:38:35,640
It's difficult!

10730
07:38:37,380 --> 07:38:37,820
Right?

10731
07:38:40,520 --> 07:38:40,960
Sisyphus...

10732
07:38:40,960 --> 07:38:41,780
Sisyphus...

10733
07:38:42,900 --> 07:38:44,120
Maybe she meant to say...

10734
07:38:44,120 --> 07:38:45,160
Why are we still here?

10735
07:38:45,360 --> 07:38:46,320
Just to suffer.

10736
07:38:48,080 --> 07:38:49,880
You can do what Mint believe in you.

10737
07:38:49,980 --> 07:38:50,800
Do for her.

10738
07:38:51,100 --> 07:38:51,540
Why?

10739
07:38:52,520 --> 07:38:54,280
I guess I have to suffer...

10740
07:38:54,280 --> 07:38:55,460
For my Kamiyoshi.

10741
07:38:56,140 --> 07:38:56,960
But it's okay.

10742
07:38:57,040 --> 07:38:58,660
If my Kamiyoshi wants me to suffer...

10743
07:38:59,340 --> 07:39:00,800
Then I don't mind it so much.

10744
07:39:00,980 --> 07:39:02,600
May Kenya play Atlantis no Nazo.

10745
07:39:02,720 --> 07:39:04,640
We gotta play Atlantis no Nazo!

10746
07:39:04,700 --> 07:39:05,200
You guys!

10747
07:39:05,840 --> 07:39:06,580
Well do we?

10748
07:39:07,420 --> 07:39:08,280
Do we actually?

10749
07:39:09,840 --> 07:39:11,460
I say that but now I'm like...

10750
07:39:11,460 --> 07:39:11,840
Wait a minute.

10751
07:39:12,300 --> 07:39:13,800
Do I actually have to play that?

10752
07:39:14,640 --> 07:39:15,080
Hmm...

10753
07:39:17,860 --> 07:39:18,300
Hmm...

10754
07:39:20,000 --> 07:39:20,440
Hmm...

10755
07:39:20,440 --> 07:39:21,180
Hmm...

10756
07:39:22,200 --> 07:39:22,640
Hmm...

10757
07:39:23,140 --> 07:39:23,580
Hmm...

10758
07:39:23,580 --> 07:39:24,060
Hmm...

10759
07:39:24,580 --> 07:39:25,020
Hmm...

10760
07:39:25,020 --> 07:39:25,220
Hmm...

10761
07:39:25,220 --> 07:39:25,440
Hmm...

10762
07:39:27,820 --> 07:39:28,800
Do you want to?

10763
07:39:29,000 --> 07:39:30,920
Yeah, I do want to play it actually.

10764
07:39:31,240 --> 07:39:32,860
I think it's fine to...

10765
07:39:33,440 --> 07:39:34,620
Also play...

10766
07:39:35,280 --> 07:39:36,380
Games like that.

10767
07:39:36,620 --> 07:39:37,580
It's a challenge.

10768
07:39:37,660 --> 07:39:38,160
It's a challenge.

10769
07:39:38,640 --> 07:39:39,980
I'll increase my...

10770
07:39:39,980 --> 07:39:41,520
My gamer...

10771
07:39:41,520 --> 07:39:42,980
My gamer skills.

10772
07:39:44,220 --> 07:39:45,040
Thank you!

10773
07:39:47,220 --> 07:39:47,740
Space...

10774
07:39:47,740 --> 07:39:48,700
Ghost...

10775
07:39:48,700 --> 07:39:49,520
Coast to coast.

10776
07:39:49,900 --> 07:39:51,080
Congrats on beating the game.

10777
07:39:51,260 --> 07:39:52,120
I really love how...

10778
07:39:52,120 --> 07:39:54,840
Over the top all the animations were in this one.

10779
07:39:54,840 --> 07:39:57,340
I was dying over a snake dodging the bullets while in the car...

10780
07:39:57,340 --> 07:39:58,340
In the car chase.

10781
07:39:58,580 --> 07:39:59,780
I know it's so...

10782
07:39:59,780 --> 07:40:00,700
There's so much going on.

10783
07:40:01,340 --> 07:40:01,980
Yes, Minto.

10784
07:40:02,720 --> 07:40:03,520
No, Minto.

10785
07:40:04,360 --> 07:40:05,160
Yes, Minto.

10786
07:40:06,080 --> 07:40:06,880
Of course.

10787
07:40:07,600 --> 07:40:08,400
Madam Ghost.

10788
07:40:10,560 --> 07:40:11,340
I am Dragon.

10789
07:40:11,440 --> 07:40:12,460
Thank you for the 10 gifted!

10790
07:40:14,500 --> 07:40:15,980
Blue Echo, welcome to Mambo Show.

10791
07:40:16,880 --> 07:40:17,820
Seymour, thank you.

10792
07:40:17,900 --> 07:40:18,680
Marilyn, thank you.

10793
07:40:18,760 --> 07:40:21,160
I really like the OG better but this is a really fun alternative take.

10794
07:40:21,280 --> 07:40:21,480
Yeah.

10795
07:40:21,660 --> 07:40:22,440
Of course.

10796
07:40:22,500 --> 07:40:23,200
I agree.

10797
07:40:23,840 --> 07:40:24,740
I like the OG better.

10798
07:40:25,940 --> 07:40:29,320
But this one is also so silly, goofy, fun.

10799
07:40:30,060 --> 07:40:32,040
I think I just love every Metal Gear.

10800
07:40:33,440 --> 07:40:34,680
I think I just...

10801
07:40:35,460 --> 07:40:36,260
I can't...

10802
07:40:38,480 --> 07:40:39,280
I can't...

10803
07:40:40,600 --> 07:40:43,060
Just say that I like one more than the other.

10804
07:40:43,480 --> 07:40:43,940
Well, no.

10805
07:40:44,040 --> 07:40:44,540
I can't say that.

10806
07:40:44,680 --> 07:40:45,320
But you know what I mean.

10807
07:40:45,380 --> 07:40:46,540
I just can't say like...

10808
07:40:47,160 --> 07:40:48,860
This is the bad one.

10809
07:40:53,320 --> 07:40:54,380
They're all really good.

10810
07:40:54,980 --> 07:40:55,860
Play Snatcher.

10811
07:40:55,860 --> 07:40:57,060
I wanna play Snatcher.

10812
07:40:57,180 --> 07:40:58,100
I wanna play Policenauts.

10813
07:40:58,100 --> 07:40:58,740
I wanna play Snatcher.

10814
07:41:00,540 --> 07:41:04,620
I own Policenauts.

10815
07:41:04,620 --> 07:41:05,800
Still looking for Snatcher.

10816
07:41:06,620 --> 07:41:07,140
Unfortunately.

10817
07:41:08,540 --> 07:41:09,060
Unfortunately.

10818
07:41:10,220 --> 07:41:10,800
Prove it.

10819
07:41:10,840 --> 07:41:12,620
Buy a second pachinko machine.

10820
07:41:13,860 --> 07:41:15,700
I'll have them stare at each other.

10821
07:41:15,800 --> 07:41:16,080
Oh my god.

10822
07:41:16,300 --> 07:41:17,280
It's Isla.

10823
07:41:19,480 --> 07:41:20,640
Marilyn, thank you.

10824
07:41:22,300 --> 07:41:22,740
Yeah.

10825
07:41:30,280 --> 07:41:31,780
There's so many games I want to play.

10826
07:41:33,060 --> 07:41:33,500
So...

10827
07:41:33,500 --> 07:41:34,660
Oh, we have time.

10828
07:41:35,300 --> 07:41:36,680
We have time no worries.

10829
07:41:37,620 --> 07:41:38,540
I don't wanna...

10830
07:41:38,540 --> 07:41:42,120
I don't wanna rush through everything so fast, you know?

10831
07:41:42,800 --> 07:41:43,940
And then be like...

10832
07:41:44,660 --> 07:41:46,440
Burned out a little bit or something.

10833
07:41:46,660 --> 07:41:47,040
I don't know.

10834
07:41:50,060 --> 07:41:51,100
Revolver Ocelot.

10835
07:41:51,220 --> 07:41:51,820
Parentheses.

10836
07:41:51,880 --> 07:41:53,020
Revolver Ocelot.

10837
07:41:53,240 --> 07:41:53,840
Parentheses.

10838
07:41:53,920 --> 07:41:55,040
Revolver Ocelot.

10839
07:41:55,320 --> 07:41:56,660
Make them kiss.

10840
07:42:00,100 --> 07:42:01,540
Play what you enjoy.

10841
07:42:01,780 --> 07:42:02,200
Yeah.

10842
07:42:03,500 --> 07:42:04,100
Yeah.

10843
07:42:05,340 --> 07:42:07,040
So far I am, so...

10844
07:42:08,840 --> 07:42:10,700
So far... I mean...

10845
07:42:11,400 --> 07:42:12,440
It's like, whatever.

10846
07:42:12,680 --> 07:42:13,400
You know, I'm just like...

10847
07:42:15,540 --> 07:42:16,700
It's like... whatever.

10848
07:42:20,300 --> 07:42:22,360
It's not like I'm having a blast or anything.

10849
07:42:22,500 --> 07:42:24,440
It's not like I'm having the time of my afterlife or anything.

10850
07:42:24,700 --> 07:42:26,960
It's just like, you know...

10851
07:42:38,450 --> 07:42:39,170
Revolver Patches.

10852
07:42:47,890 --> 07:42:50,350
My time of my afterlife.

10853
07:42:50,350 --> 07:42:52,650
I'm...

10854
07:42:54,330 --> 07:42:55,530
Wink.

10855
07:42:55,550 --> 07:42:55,770
Cute.

10856
07:42:55,970 --> 07:42:56,230
It's not a wink!

10857
07:42:57,830 --> 07:42:58,730
It's just...

10858
07:43:00,030 --> 07:43:00,630
Twinkle.

10859
07:43:00,910 --> 07:43:02,110
Twinkle.

10860
07:43:02,350 --> 07:43:03,990
More twinkle.

10861
07:43:04,750 --> 07:43:06,150
It's not a wink.

10862
07:43:08,170 --> 07:43:08,770
Twinkle.

10863
07:43:10,430 --> 07:43:11,630
Twinkle.

10864
07:43:12,750 --> 07:43:13,830
Twinkle.

10865
07:43:16,230 --> 07:43:16,830
Twinkle.

10866
07:43:19,410 --> 07:43:21,670
Would you consider HeartGold SoulSilver?

10867
07:43:22,110 --> 07:43:22,710
Would you consider HeartGold SoulSilver?

10868
07:43:26,340 --> 07:43:26,940
Maybe.

10869
07:43:29,540 --> 07:43:30,140
Uh...

10870
07:43:30,960 --> 07:43:32,960
I don't think I ever actually played...

10871
07:43:32,960 --> 07:43:34,300
Oh, sorry.

10872
07:43:34,640 --> 07:43:37,460
I don't think I ever actually played HeartGold or SoulSilver.

10873
07:43:39,420 --> 07:43:40,900
I don't think I ever actually played HeartGold or SoulSilver.

10874
07:43:40,900 --> 07:43:41,020
Wrong!

10875
07:43:43,600 --> 07:43:44,200
Wrong.

10876
07:43:44,660 --> 07:43:45,100
Wrong.

10877
07:43:48,860 --> 07:43:49,800
I've never played...

10878
07:43:49,800 --> 07:43:52,440
I've played original Gold and Silver, but I've never played the Remix.

10879
07:43:53,520 --> 07:43:55,600
I've never played...

10880
07:43:55,600 --> 07:43:55,600
I've played original Gold and Silver, but I've never played the Remix.

10881
07:43:55,600 --> 07:43:56,140
I don't...

10882
07:43:56,140 --> 07:43:57,780
I actually don't... So I don't own them either.

10883
07:43:59,340 --> 07:44:00,380
Pokemon games sell...

10884
07:44:00,920 --> 07:44:02,000
They're so expensive.

10885
07:44:02,260 --> 07:44:03,200
Even second hand.

10886
07:44:03,760 --> 07:44:04,440
Like, let's see.

10887
07:44:04,500 --> 07:44:04,720
Hold on.

10888
07:44:04,820 --> 07:44:05,780
If I go to eBay...

10889
07:44:06,440 --> 07:44:09,500
eBay.com HeartGold.

10890
07:44:09,820 --> 07:44:11,180
What's it for, too?

10891
07:44:11,420 --> 07:44:12,400
Oh, it's a DS game!

10892
07:44:12,560 --> 07:44:13,480
So I can play it on my 3DS.

10893
07:44:13,740 --> 07:44:13,840
Oh, it's a DS game!

10894
07:44:13,840 --> 07:44:13,840
So I can play it on my 3DS.

10895
07:44:14,200 --> 07:44:14,800
Oh, wait.

10896
07:44:14,880 --> 07:44:15,540
This isn't so bad.

10897
07:44:15,560 --> 07:44:16,120
It's 40.

10898
07:44:16,380 --> 07:44:18,220
Oh, wait.

10899
07:44:18,220 --> 07:44:18,220
This isn't so bad.

10900
07:44:18,220 --> 07:44:18,220
It's 40.

10901
07:44:18,220 --> 07:44:19,540
It's 40 without the case.

10902
07:44:20,200 --> 07:44:21,280
I don't need the case.

10903
07:44:22,940 --> 07:44:23,520
Let's see.

10904
07:44:23,720 --> 07:44:24,240
SoulSilver.

10905
07:44:24,260 --> 07:44:27,640
I always get SoulSilver... or I've played Silver before because I like Lugia.

10906
07:44:35,850 --> 07:44:36,890
I always get SoulSilver...

10907
07:44:36,890 --> 07:44:36,890
or I've played Silver before because I like Lugia.

10908
07:44:36,890 --> 07:44:36,890
Yeah.

10909
07:44:37,170 --> 07:44:38,130
Oh my god.

10910
07:44:38,770 --> 07:44:39,910
A thousand and one?

10911
07:44:40,090 --> 07:44:40,610
What?

10912
07:44:41,070 --> 07:44:43,170
Pokemon SoulSilver Walmart exclusive.

10913
07:44:43,410 --> 07:44:44,290
Big box rare.

10914
07:44:44,450 --> 07:44:44,930
See notes.

10915
07:44:45,030 --> 07:44:45,690
USA seller.

10916
07:44:45,690 --> 07:44:49,350
A thousand and one dollars with 22 bids.

10917
07:44:49,530 --> 07:44:50,010
A thousand and one dollars with 22 bids.

10918
07:44:50,010 --> 07:44:50,010
Wait.

10919
07:44:50,210 --> 07:44:51,190
What's the notes?

10920
07:44:52,030 --> 07:44:52,630
What?

10921
07:44:53,010 --> 07:44:54,450
Why is it so expensive?

10922
07:44:58,720 --> 07:45:00,220
It comes with...

10923
07:45:00,220 --> 07:45:03,760
Oh, it comes with a Lugia figure and a PokeWalker jacket.

10924
07:45:04,660 --> 07:45:04,780
Oh, it comes with a Lugia figure and a PokeWalker jacket.

10925
07:45:04,780 --> 07:45:06,360
It doesn't even come with the PokeWalker!

10926
07:45:07,700 --> 07:45:08,460
Oh, wait.

10927
07:45:08,540 --> 07:45:09,020
Is it...

10928
07:45:09,020 --> 07:45:10,880
It does.

10929
07:45:11,180 --> 07:45:12,740
It does come with the PokeWalker.

10930
07:45:12,760 --> 07:45:13,360
Just kidding.

10931
07:45:13,360 --> 07:45:13,380
Just kidding.

10932
07:45:17,260 --> 07:45:17,700
Wow.

10933
07:45:17,700 --> 07:45:19,320
That's a lot of money.

10934
07:45:20,240 --> 07:45:23,260
And it comes with all the sleeves and everything that comes inside.

10935
07:45:26,020 --> 07:45:26,460
Sheesh.

10936
07:45:29,180 --> 07:45:30,700
I didn't know there was a walker.

10937
07:45:31,280 --> 07:45:32,700
I had a Digimon...

10938
07:45:32,700 --> 07:45:35,400
I did have a Pikachu one when I was a kid.

10939
07:45:35,620 --> 07:45:37,060
And I had a Digimon one.

10940
07:45:38,980 --> 07:45:41,820
For some reason, I never had a Tamagotchi.

10941
07:45:42,680 --> 07:45:43,340
For some reason, I never had a Tamagotchi.

10942
07:45:43,340 --> 07:45:43,360
Oh my gosh.

10943
07:45:43,420 --> 07:45:44,680
This ends in 22 minutes.

10944
07:45:45,060 --> 07:45:45,420
Wait.

10945
07:45:45,500 --> 07:45:46,980
I kind of want to see how high does it get.

10946
07:45:47,560 --> 07:45:47,920
Okay.

10947
07:45:47,980 --> 07:45:49,020
It's still at a thousand and one.

10948
07:45:49,480 --> 07:45:50,340
When's the last bid?

10949
07:45:51,980 --> 07:45:53,180
Oh, I don't have an eBay account.

10950
07:45:55,460 --> 07:45:57,160
Or I do, but I don't remember the login.

10951
07:46:00,060 --> 07:46:00,780
Debbie Orange!

10952
07:46:01,060 --> 07:46:01,560
Hey, boss.

10953
07:46:01,620 --> 07:46:02,180
Exciting news.

10954
07:46:02,240 --> 07:46:03,240
I got myself a crush.

10955
07:46:05,160 --> 07:46:07,260
But the problem is she's cold and she's cruel.

10956
07:46:07,580 --> 07:46:08,780
But she knows what she's doing.

10957
07:46:08,880 --> 07:46:11,420
She pushed me in the pool at her last school reunion.

10958
07:46:11,600 --> 07:46:11,960
She...

10959
07:46:16,400 --> 07:46:17,820
Thank you, Debbie Orange.

10960
07:46:18,380 --> 07:46:18,820
Thank you, Debbie Orange.

10961
07:46:19,880 --> 07:46:20,600
No surprise.

10962
07:46:20,740 --> 07:46:24,920
I saw someone on eBay sell Final Fantasy 7 OG for 20k.

10963
07:46:25,680 --> 07:46:26,120
What?

10964
07:46:29,820 --> 07:46:31,220
I had a Tamagotchi.

10965
07:46:31,320 --> 07:46:32,160
I never had one.

10966
07:46:33,160 --> 07:46:35,540
But I had the Pikachu one and the Digimon one.

10967
07:46:35,840 --> 07:46:37,100
It's not that I didn't want one.

10968
07:46:37,180 --> 07:46:38,180
I think my mom just...

10969
07:46:38,620 --> 07:46:40,360
It was always my mom that I would ask.

10970
07:46:41,400 --> 07:46:41,840
Wait.

10971
07:46:41,900 --> 07:46:42,480
There's another one.

10972
07:46:42,480 --> 07:46:42,620
This one...

10973
07:46:43,120 --> 07:46:45,220
The heart gold one is even more expensive.

10974
07:46:46,320 --> 07:46:47,520
Ends in 14 minutes.

10975
07:46:47,720 --> 07:46:48,980
With only 17 bids.

10976
07:46:52,080 --> 07:46:52,760
Thank you.

10977
07:46:52,860 --> 07:46:53,220
Thank you.

10978
07:46:55,440 --> 07:47:00,340
If you ever wanted to cover the best is yet to come, Donna Burke did an English lyrics cover.

10979
07:47:00,540 --> 07:47:00,740
Yes!

10980
07:47:00,840 --> 07:47:01,640
I've seen that before.

10981
07:47:05,580 --> 07:47:08,900
Since you own Ace Combat 3, which Ace Combat 3 do you have meant?

10982
07:47:09,120 --> 07:47:10,900
Is it from the global version or the JP version?

10983
07:47:10,900 --> 07:47:12,900
I will check.

10984
07:47:17,660 --> 07:47:18,320
I will check.

10985
07:47:18,320 --> 07:47:20,100
I got it a long while ago so I don't remember.

10986
07:47:20,860 --> 07:47:21,620
I got it a long while ago so I don't remember.

10987
07:47:21,620 --> 07:47:22,220
I don't remember.

10988
07:47:22,700 --> 07:47:23,520
I will check though.

10989
07:47:25,660 --> 07:47:26,420
Tamagotchi is nostalgic.

10990
07:47:26,960 --> 07:47:28,140
It's nostalgic, right?

10991
07:47:32,710 --> 07:47:33,830
I've always wanted one.

10992
07:47:34,630 --> 07:47:36,830
The Tamagotchi now is amazing.

10993
07:47:39,030 --> 07:47:40,310
Tamagotchis now are so different.

10994
07:47:40,430 --> 07:47:40,990
They're so crazy.

10995
07:47:41,750 --> 07:47:42,490
They're like...

10996
07:47:44,890 --> 07:47:45,330
They're like the green and everything.

10997
07:47:46,130 --> 07:47:46,610
Pandal!

10998
07:47:46,610 --> 07:47:47,670
Welcome to my bush.

10999
07:47:47,750 --> 07:47:48,230
Thank you.

11000
07:47:49,270 --> 07:47:55,870
Since you own a gamecube, any interest in other big game made by a studio that co-developed Twin Snakes Eternal Darkness?

11001
07:47:56,230 --> 07:47:58,050
If you guys have any...

11002
07:47:58,050 --> 07:48:00,390
Since I said I've never had a gamecube growing up.

11003
07:48:00,470 --> 07:48:04,110
If you guys have any gamecube recommendations, please let me know.

11004
07:48:04,250 --> 07:48:07,550
I will definitely see if I can find it and I will play it.

11005
07:48:07,970 --> 07:48:09,810
If I'm interested, of course, obviously.

11006
07:48:10,150 --> 07:48:11,750
I'm open to anything.

11007
07:48:12,930 --> 07:48:13,930
I'm in bootcamp.

11008
07:48:14,010 --> 07:48:14,710
I'm so tired.

11009
07:48:14,890 --> 07:48:15,750
Please give me a PON!

11010
07:48:16,410 --> 07:48:17,030
Ganbare!

11011
07:48:20,790 --> 07:48:21,790
Gotcha Force.

11012
07:48:21,930 --> 07:48:23,350
Get out of here, mod.

11013
07:48:26,050 --> 07:48:27,150
Mario Sunshine?

11014
07:48:29,660 --> 07:48:30,470
Mario Sunshine!

11015
07:48:32,590 --> 07:48:33,510
Yay, yay!

11016
07:48:33,690 --> 07:48:34,470
Mario Sunshine!

11017
07:48:35,770 --> 07:48:37,630
I've still been playing Korone.

11018
07:48:37,930 --> 07:48:39,990
The wow, wow, wow Korone box.

11019
07:48:43,030 --> 07:48:44,990
Leave them in the comments though.

11020
07:48:45,450 --> 07:48:48,970
Like, OG Resident Evil 4 is for the GameCube.

11021
07:48:49,110 --> 07:48:49,470
Oh, really?

11022
07:48:52,490 --> 07:48:56,070
But yeah, leave it in the comments because if you put it here, I'll forget.

11023
07:48:57,090 --> 07:48:59,050
So once the VOD is up.

11024
07:49:00,550 --> 07:49:02,790
Comment, like, for engagement.

11025
07:49:05,490 --> 07:49:08,310
That way I can go back through and see.

11026
07:49:09,990 --> 07:49:10,070
Hmm.

11027
07:49:13,250 --> 07:49:16,230
I realize I have not had dinner.

11028
07:49:17,150 --> 07:49:18,610
And it's almost 11pm.

11029
07:49:19,350 --> 07:49:22,250
And as much as I want to keep talking with you guys.

11030
07:49:23,490 --> 07:49:26,610
I'm starting to feel my head get foggy.

11031
07:49:28,190 --> 07:49:33,050
All I had was some Twin Snake Haribo gummies.

11032
07:49:33,730 --> 07:49:36,030
Which I was going to make this into my thumbnail.

11033
07:49:36,130 --> 07:49:37,410
I was going to print out a picture.

11034
07:49:37,690 --> 07:49:39,150
And take a picture of...

11035
07:49:39,750 --> 07:49:41,730
I was going to print out like a fan art.

11036
07:49:42,990 --> 07:49:44,350
And cut it out.

11037
07:49:46,290 --> 07:49:50,630
And paste it onto the Twin Snakes packaging.

11038
07:49:50,750 --> 07:49:52,630
And take a picture and use that as my thumbnail.

11039
07:49:52,870 --> 07:49:56,190
But then I saw the thumbnail art.

11040
07:49:56,330 --> 07:49:57,970
And I was like, this is just so beautiful.

11041
07:49:58,150 --> 07:49:59,270
I have to.

11042
07:49:59,310 --> 07:50:00,790
I have to use this.

11043
07:50:03,010 --> 07:50:03,450
Spank!

11044
07:50:03,770 --> 07:50:05,370
Thank you, Dinner and Bio.

11045
07:50:06,190 --> 07:50:07,090
Yeah, I have to go.

11046
07:50:07,150 --> 07:50:08,390
I'm probably going to go make some.

11047
07:50:08,830 --> 07:50:09,990
Eggs and tomatoes.

11048
07:50:11,770 --> 07:50:13,430
Because I have to finish up my eggs.

11049
07:50:14,370 --> 07:50:14,810
Or.

11050
07:50:15,090 --> 07:50:16,950
If anyone is having a delicious meal.

11051
07:50:17,570 --> 07:50:18,010
Please.

11052
07:50:18,470 --> 07:50:19,270
Let me know.

11053
07:50:19,470 --> 07:50:19,870
One.

11054
07:50:19,990 --> 07:50:22,350
So that I can bless it with my Moi Moi Kyun powers.

11055
07:50:22,690 --> 07:50:23,250
And two.

11056
07:50:23,490 --> 07:50:25,770
So I can possess you and eat it.

11057
07:50:26,890 --> 07:50:27,330
Myself.

11058
07:50:30,590 --> 07:50:31,030
Oh.

11059
07:50:31,170 --> 07:50:33,230
I think the stream labs are a little backed up.

11060
07:50:33,290 --> 07:50:34,770
But I can still read them on my end.

11061
07:50:36,090 --> 07:50:36,530
Yeah.

11062
07:50:37,510 --> 07:50:39,430
I made eggs and tomatoes too today.

11063
07:50:39,570 --> 07:50:40,510
It's so yummy.

11064
07:50:41,810 --> 07:50:43,230
I'm having a burger right now.

11065
07:50:43,690 --> 07:50:44,170
Rogu.

11066
07:50:44,950 --> 07:50:45,870
I'm coming over.

11067
07:50:47,830 --> 07:50:48,310
Hey.

11068
07:50:48,710 --> 07:50:49,610
Don't finish it.

11069
07:50:50,170 --> 07:50:51,090
Right after this.

11070
07:50:51,210 --> 07:50:52,330
I'm possessing your body.

11071
07:50:52,550 --> 07:50:54,290
Leave like the last bite for me.

11072
07:50:54,410 --> 07:50:54,570
Okay?

11073
07:50:56,270 --> 07:50:57,910
Cheese quesadilla a while ago.

11074
07:50:57,970 --> 07:50:58,870
That doesn't help me.

11075
07:50:59,010 --> 07:50:59,770
I need it now.

11076
07:51:01,670 --> 07:51:03,390
Pizza and cinnamon buns.

11077
07:51:04,290 --> 07:51:04,770
Stop.

11078
07:51:04,770 --> 07:51:05,970
You guys are...

11079
07:51:07,050 --> 07:51:07,510
Yummy.

11080
07:51:09,030 --> 07:51:10,730
Having a bacon omelette.

11081
07:51:11,530 --> 07:51:11,990
Yummy.

11082
07:51:14,410 --> 07:51:14,870
Yummy.

11083
07:51:15,050 --> 07:51:15,510
Yummy.

11084
07:51:15,510 --> 07:51:15,790
Yummy.

11085
07:51:15,950 --> 07:51:16,410
No.

11086
07:51:16,530 --> 07:51:17,430
I need my nutrition.

11087
07:51:17,810 --> 07:51:19,170
You're still gonna get it.

11088
07:51:19,310 --> 07:51:20,610
I just get the taste.

11089
07:51:20,850 --> 07:51:21,350
You know?

11090
07:51:27,930 --> 07:51:28,390
Okay.

11091
07:51:33,500 --> 07:51:34,820
Tomorrow I have a pretty long day.

11092
07:51:34,940 --> 07:51:35,100
Oh.

11093
07:51:35,880 --> 07:51:37,290
If you are in...

11094
07:51:37,860 --> 07:51:39,300
If you are close to...

11095
07:51:39,300 --> 07:51:40,280
Wait where is this at again?

11096
07:51:42,780 --> 07:51:45,180
I'm doing an event tomorrow called Kusaland.

11097
07:51:45,840 --> 07:51:48,100
Which is an anime DJ event.

11098
07:51:48,980 --> 07:51:50,140
I will be singing.

11099
07:51:50,400 --> 07:51:51,500
I will be performing.

11100
07:51:51,820 --> 07:51:53,520
Not doing...

11101
07:51:53,520 --> 07:51:54,280
Um...

11102
07:51:55,080 --> 07:51:56,980
Not doing you know...

11103
07:51:58,080 --> 07:51:58,660
Ah...

11104
07:52:01,340 --> 07:52:01,920
The...

11105
07:52:01,920 --> 07:52:03,060
The DJ-ing.

11106
07:52:03,520 --> 07:52:12,380
But if you are in the United States, In... hold on... what... any party... any party...

11107
07:52:13,900 --> 07:52:16,940
Go to at any... wait, account suspended.

11108
07:52:17,380 --> 07:52:17,800
Uh oh.

11109
07:52:18,400 --> 07:52:20,160
Wait, I don't think that's the right one.

11110
07:52:22,320 --> 07:52:23,300
Thank you!

11111
07:52:26,240 --> 07:52:28,460
Wait, I retweeted it.

11112
07:52:31,780 --> 07:52:32,800
Where is it?

11113
07:52:32,800 --> 07:52:33,500
Oh.

11114
07:52:33,720 --> 07:52:36,200
Oh, at any song party.

11115
07:52:36,520 --> 07:52:37,500
Sorry, my bad.

11116
07:52:37,700 --> 07:52:40,260
At any song party on Twitter.

11117
07:52:40,880 --> 07:52:43,960
It's in... if you're close to Virginia.

11118
07:52:45,720 --> 07:52:46,920
Virginia, America.

11119
07:52:48,920 --> 07:52:50,620
Then, I will be there.

11120
07:52:50,900 --> 07:52:51,500
Singing.

11121
07:52:52,020 --> 07:52:53,420
It's pretty short.

11122
07:52:53,660 --> 07:52:55,800
Just a couple songs, but...

11123
07:52:58,080 --> 07:52:59,440
Springfield, Virginia.

11124
07:52:59,920 --> 07:53:01,680
I don't know where that is.

11125
07:53:03,040 --> 07:53:04,220
But, uh...

11126
07:53:04,700 --> 07:53:08,180
If you like things like doing calls and mixes...

11127
07:53:08,800 --> 07:53:09,860
You know...

11128
07:53:09,860 --> 07:53:13,520
If you want to experience that...

11129
07:53:13,520 --> 07:53:18,020
Listen to anime music and meet people that like anime music...

11130
07:53:18,020 --> 07:53:18,700
You should go!

11131
07:53:19,140 --> 07:53:21,600
Part of the DC metropolitan area.

11132
07:53:21,840 --> 07:53:24,680
It's part of the DC metropolitan area!

11133
07:53:26,540 --> 07:53:28,340
That's only 5 hours away!

11134
07:53:30,740 --> 07:53:33,360
About 20 to 30 minutes south of DC.

11135
07:53:33,620 --> 07:53:33,840
Oh!

11136
07:53:35,080 --> 07:53:36,640
But, um...

11137
07:53:36,640 --> 07:53:37,800
If not...

11138
07:53:39,020 --> 07:53:39,580
Maybe...

11139
07:53:39,580 --> 07:53:40,280
Off-Kai?

11140
07:53:40,940 --> 07:53:41,500
Maybe...

11141
07:53:41,500 --> 07:53:42,360
Somewhere else?

11142
07:53:43,440 --> 07:53:44,340
We'll have to see.

11143
07:53:45,300 --> 07:53:46,060
And, uh...

11144
07:53:46,060 --> 07:53:46,660
If anyone...

11145
07:53:46,660 --> 07:53:47,580
If anywhere else...

11146
07:53:47,580 --> 07:53:48,280
Once...

11147
07:53:48,280 --> 07:53:48,980
Or...

11148
07:53:48,980 --> 07:53:54,480
You can recommend me as a guest to your favorite anime convention in your area.

11149
07:53:54,820 --> 07:53:57,040
And then maybe they'll accept me as a guest.

11150
07:53:57,240 --> 07:53:58,320
And then maybe I can say yes.

11151
07:53:58,320 --> 07:53:58,540
I'll tell you that.

11152
07:54:00,580 --> 07:54:01,160
Yeah.

11153
07:54:04,560 --> 07:54:05,440
When is it?

11154
07:54:05,720 --> 07:54:06,300
Tomorrow!

11155
07:54:08,060 --> 07:54:09,420
It's tomorrow night!

11156
07:54:10,100 --> 07:54:10,680
Uh...

11157
07:54:10,680 --> 07:54:11,220
I'll...

11158
07:54:11,220 --> 07:54:13,020
I'll retweet it again on my Twitter.

11159
07:54:13,240 --> 07:54:13,920
But go...

11160
07:54:13,920 --> 07:54:18,440
You can go to any song party on Twitter as well to see the information.

11161
07:54:18,940 --> 07:54:19,640
It's tomorrow!

11162
07:54:20,660 --> 07:54:21,240
Tomorrow!

11163
07:54:23,680 --> 07:54:24,260
Tomorrow.

11164
07:54:27,920 --> 07:54:29,080
Ena intensifies.

11165
07:54:33,160 --> 07:54:33,600
Ena intensifies.

11166
07:54:33,600 --> 07:54:33,760
Ena intensifies.

11167
07:54:35,100 --> 07:54:35,980
Ok guys.

11168
07:54:36,120 --> 07:54:37,260
I'm gonna gooo...

11169
07:54:37,760 --> 07:54:38,980
I'm gonna go eat...

11170
07:54:40,360 --> 07:54:40,800
Ok guys.

11171
07:54:40,800 --> 07:54:42,240
And I'll see you guys...

11172
07:54:42,240 --> 07:54:43,280
Not tomorrow...

11173
07:54:43,280 --> 07:54:44,700
Well, maybe tomorrow if I see you there?

11174
07:54:45,220 --> 07:54:45,660
Um...

11175
07:54:45,660 --> 07:54:46,200
If not...

11176
07:54:46,200 --> 07:54:48,300
I'm going to see you on Sunday.

11177
07:54:50,340 --> 07:54:50,780
Yeah.

11178
07:54:51,620 --> 07:54:52,060
Yeah.

11179
07:54:52,180 --> 07:54:52,620
Yeah.

11180
07:54:52,620 --> 07:54:53,040
Yeah.

11181
07:54:53,620 --> 07:54:54,060
Yeah.

11182
07:54:54,060 --> 07:54:54,260
Uh -huh.

11183
07:54:55,720 --> 07:54:58,760
I checked for Anime NYC and the guests have to apply themselves.

11184
07:54:59,120 --> 07:54:59,760
As much as I want to be an announcer.

11185
07:54:59,760 --> 07:55:01,460
I'm unable to request you.

11186
07:55:02,580 --> 07:55:03,560
Well, we'll see.

11187
07:55:04,440 --> 07:55:05,620
We shall see.

11188
07:55:06,220 --> 07:55:08,220
Became a member today, so this was my first stream.

11189
07:55:08,320 --> 07:55:08,920
No way, really?

11190
07:55:09,480 --> 07:55:11,140
I have to go now, but I had a great time.

11191
07:55:11,180 --> 07:55:12,100
Look forward to the next one.

11192
07:55:12,180 --> 07:55:13,960
Thank you so much, TikTakTiger.

11193
07:55:14,120 --> 07:55:14,640
Thank you.

11194
07:55:15,460 --> 07:55:16,540
Have a good night.

11195
07:55:18,840 --> 07:55:21,460
Thanks for sticking around for so long, too.

11196
07:55:21,700 --> 07:55:22,760
Really appreciate it.

11197
07:55:28,600 --> 07:55:29,660
Thanks for the stream.

11198
07:55:29,880 --> 07:55:30,440
Thank you, guys.

11199
07:55:30,740 --> 07:55:31,540
Thank you, thank you.

11200
07:55:33,760 --> 07:55:35,480
Sunday, I'm still figuring out what I want to do.

11201
07:55:35,580 --> 07:55:36,840
I'll figure it out.

11202
07:55:43,600 --> 07:55:44,760
Please go to AMYC.

11203
07:55:45,880 --> 07:55:48,000
It's not up to me, but I'll do my best.

11204
07:55:48,280 --> 07:55:48,580
I guess.

11205
07:55:50,920 --> 07:55:52,740
Will the KusaLand performances be strong?

11206
07:55:52,760 --> 07:55:53,400
Yes!

11207
07:55:53,760 --> 07:55:55,680
It will be streamed on Twitch.

11208
07:55:55,920 --> 07:55:56,740
They have a Twitch.

11209
07:55:57,540 --> 07:55:59,200
I'm pretty sure it's...

11210
07:56:00,380 --> 07:56:01,120
Wait, hold on.

11211
07:56:01,360 --> 07:56:04,320
I'm pretty sure it's...

11212
07:56:04,320 --> 07:56:06,320
They're on Twitch at the same name.

11213
07:56:07,360 --> 07:56:09,540
At least they told me it would be streamed.

11214
07:56:11,780 --> 07:56:12,260
Yes.

11215
07:56:12,260 --> 07:56:13,980
On Twitch, any song party.

11216
07:56:14,420 --> 07:56:16,100
So it will be... it should be.

11217
07:56:16,480 --> 07:56:18,680
It should be also on there, too.

11218
07:56:21,240 --> 07:56:22,740
Thanks for another fun episode.

11219
07:56:22,760 --> 07:56:23,380
I'm going to stream again.

11220
07:56:23,820 --> 07:56:25,960
Thank you, customer Johnson.

11221
07:56:26,500 --> 07:56:28,300
Hal and Dave, or is it Dave and Hal?

11222
07:56:34,520 --> 07:56:36,600
I think I actually like Hal and Dave better.

11223
07:56:37,820 --> 07:56:38,920
No, Dave and Hal.

11224
07:56:44,000 --> 07:56:47,860
If you ever end up in Salt Lake or Denver, I'll be sure to get a ticket.

11225
07:56:48,660 --> 07:56:49,940
Hope you have a great time tomorrow.

11226
07:56:49,960 --> 07:56:50,660
Thank you.

11227
07:56:51,660 --> 07:56:52,400
Thank you, guys.

11228
07:56:52,400 --> 07:56:53,280
Thank you, thank you.

11229
07:56:54,900 --> 07:56:56,120
Take care of yourself.

11230
07:56:56,240 --> 07:56:57,200
Have a great weekend.

11231
07:56:58,180 --> 07:57:00,320
Since I might not see you on Saturday.

11232
07:57:00,940 --> 07:57:01,200
But...

11233
07:57:01,800 --> 07:57:02,860
Get lots of rest.

11234
07:57:03,220 --> 07:57:05,220
If you're working, do your best.

11235
07:57:06,840 --> 07:57:08,160
Do you know when you show up?

11236
07:57:08,480 --> 07:57:09,540
I think it's like...

11237
07:57:10,340 --> 07:57:10,820
6...

11238
07:57:11,880 --> 07:57:13,800
Around 6.30 p.m.

11239
07:57:13,800 --> 07:57:14,460
or so.

11240
07:57:15,420 --> 07:57:17,580
If everything goes right, I think.

11241
07:57:17,580 --> 07:57:18,020
Haha.

11242
07:57:20,500 --> 07:57:22,340
Series I is on hiatus.

11243
07:57:22,600 --> 07:57:25,440
And I don't have contacts at Anime Revolution anymore.

11244
07:57:25,600 --> 07:57:26,220
But I'll try.

11245
07:57:27,360 --> 07:57:28,180
Thanks, Corin.

11246
07:57:30,200 --> 07:57:30,800
Alrighty.

11247
07:57:31,220 --> 07:57:32,100
I'm going to go eat.

11248
07:57:32,340 --> 07:57:33,080
Lots of Minto!

11249
07:57:34,460 --> 07:57:36,260
Thank you so much.

11250
07:57:36,520 --> 07:57:37,620
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

11251
07:57:38,600 --> 07:57:42,780
And thanks for letting me finish The Twin Snakes.

11252
07:57:43,560 --> 07:57:44,160
Yeah!

11253
07:57:45,160 --> 07:57:46,220
Thank you, guys.

11254
07:57:47,580 --> 07:57:48,300
Thank you so much.

11255
07:57:49,020 --> 07:57:51,980
Otsu, Otsu, Otsu, Otsu, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto.

11256
07:57:52,100 --> 07:57:54,660
Otsu, Minto, Otsu, Minto, Otsu, Otsu, Otsu, Minto.

11257
07:57:55,540 --> 07:57:55,940
Otsu, Otsu, Otsu, Otsu, Minto!

11258
07:57:55,940 --> 07:57:56,620
Take care!

11259
07:57:57,000 --> 07:57:57,780
Bye-bye!

11260
07:57:57,880 --> 07:57:58,660
Thank you, guys!

11261
07:57:58,720 --> 07:57:59,420
Bye-bye, bye-bye!

11262
07:57:59,840 --> 07:58:00,660
See you later!

11263
07:58:00,960 --> 07:58:01,540
Bye-bye!

11264
07:58:04,660 --> 07:58:05,180
Oh!

11265
07:58:05,720 --> 07:58:06,240
Oh!

11266
07:58:07,300 --> 07:58:08,860
Double, double, double.

11267
07:58:10,580 --> 07:58:11,880
This is awkward.

11268
07:58:13,980 --> 07:58:14,500
Ah.

11269
07:58:19,040 --> 07:58:19,500
Ah.

11270
07:58:20,040 --> 07:58:20,640
Ah.

11271
07:58:38,160 --> 07:58:38,760
Wait.

11272
07:58:40,680 --> 07:58:41,280
Bye!

11273
07:58:42,600 --> 07:58:43,200
Wait.

11274
07:58:50,130 --> 07:58:50,730
Oh.

11275
07:58:51,170 --> 07:58:52,810
I was going to say something and I forgot.

11276
07:58:53,110 --> 07:58:53,590
You know what?

11277
07:58:53,690 --> 07:58:53,750
Ah.

11278
07:58:53,970 --> 07:58:54,570
Wah!

11279
07:58:55,670 --> 07:58:56,270
Bye!
