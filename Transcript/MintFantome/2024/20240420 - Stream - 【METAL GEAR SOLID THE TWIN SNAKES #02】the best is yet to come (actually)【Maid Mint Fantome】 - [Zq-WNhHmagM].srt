1
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,460
I don't think we watched this before.

2
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,700
I think we only watched the briefings.

3
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,560
I don't think this is the same as...

4
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,820
No, it didn't, right?

5
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:34,990
Alaska.

6
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,330
That's where snakes don't belong.

7
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,590
That was an audio, by the way, guys.

8
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,790
Let me know.

9
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:52,890
It's always confusing for me because the El Gato says
something different than what my mixer says.

10
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:54,770
It's good?

11
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:03,470
The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island
in Alaska's Fox Archipelago was attacked and captured by

12
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,750
next generation special forces being led by members of
Foxhound.

13
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,530
Look at that guy.

14
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,210
They are demanding that the government turn over the remains
of Big Boss.

15
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,350
And they say that if their demands are not met within 24
hours, audio good?

16
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,110
They'll launch a nuclear weapon.

17
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:32,830
who's that oh it doesn't matter who he is Roy Campbell says
you don't matter I'm in charge of this here mission also I

18
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:39,790
just realized he has the Fox town logo on his first you're
to rescue DARPA chief Donald why does he have the Fox town

19
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:50,330
logo on his jacket secondly you're to investigate whether or
not the terrorists have the ability to make a nuclear strike

20
00:04:50,330 --> 00:05:00,550
and stop them if they do Naomi Hunter I wonder what Hunter
is in Germany by sub it's his old jacket yeah I know he was

21
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,510
Fox Town you'd think though that like you wouldn't want to
wear something that the terrorists are wearing like are

22
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:14,310
associating themselves with you know what I mean you'd think
that you'd want to be like hmm I'm not with them

23
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,170
Wow!

24
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,010
Oh my god, he's speed.

25
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,990
After the SDV gets as close as it can.

26
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,350
Yeah.

27
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,170
Dispose of it.

28
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,390
Oh, get rid of it.

29
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,290
That's so wasteful.

30
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,010
High tech special forces unit Foxhound.

31
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,790
Your former unit.

32
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,130
Sorry, I know it probably feels like we just like jumped
right into it.

33
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,910
So they're still around.

34
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,830
This is just playing the intro, you know?

35
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,610
There are six members of Foxhound involved in this terrorist
activity.

36
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,450
A little, a little refresher, right?

37
00:05:51,910 --> 00:06:03,570
abilities the sushi the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter
decoy octopus master of disguise thanks sushi for the 20

38
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:13,990
good and revolver ocelot shaman specialist and interrogation
and a you pronounce it wrong colonel and finally giant and

39
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:20,910

40
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,910
Giant and shaman.

41
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,190
Big Pompey, welcome to Membush.

42
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,270
Thank you!

43
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,790
Mint is in the bandana.

44
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,670
Sheesh.

45
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,810
Oh, whoa!

46
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,410
There...

47
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,570
Were those always there?

48
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,150
I don't think so, right?

49
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,210
Maybe you should have abandoned it, Snake!

50
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,430
Maybe you should have gotten rid of it!

51
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,870
This is why we're messed up in the mission.

52
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,370
Because we're messed up in the head from all the clunks.

53
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,650
We have a concussion!

54
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,430
He covers the whole island.

55
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,990
I'll instruct you by codec after you reach your target.

56
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,530
Anyone going with me?

57
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,870
As always, this is a one-man sneaking mission.

58
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,470
Oh, yeah.

59
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,370
O-S-P.

60
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,110
Yes.

61
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,610
This is a top-secret black op.

62
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,270
Don't expect any official support.

63
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:18,350
Whoa.

64
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:19,990
Drop my controller.

65
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,830
I'm so clumsy.

66
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,330
Wow.

67
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,010
Welcome back, welcome back,

68
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,710
welcome back.

69
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,350
I'm so glad Found You has stumbled upon you during a
difficult time in my life and your MGS playthroughs really

70
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,730
help take my mind on the things.

71
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:07,430
I'm glad that I could do a little bit to help with whatever
you were going through.

72
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,390
Bell's a hurry.

73
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,310
And hopefully you enjoy these playthroughs.

74
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,930
Also, talk strength is a here with a pink.

75
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,950
This got moved to Friday.

76
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,010
I told my manager I could not come into the office.

77
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:20,650
No!

78
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,330
What do you mean?

79
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:23,930
Don't.

80
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:24,770
No!

81
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,770
Oh my gosh, please.

82
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,630
Don't skip work because of...

83
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,890
There's a VOD, you know?

84
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,750
I'm Jago's.

85
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,650

Johnny, thank you for the 5.

89
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,610
This is getting out of hand.

90
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,310
Now there's two.

91
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,250

Thank you, thank you.

94
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,590
Last time we left off with Merrill getting a little
pew-pewed.

95
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,530
She's kind of on the ground.

96
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,130
She's kind of bleeding out.

97
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,310
We kind of got to go get a PSG to save her.

98
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:09,650
but I I'm gonna turn down the music just a little bit I plan
on not saving her I'm sorry we are going to be doing the

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,390
Kia, welcome to membership.

00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,750
Oh, boy, thank you for the gift.

112
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,610
Did it just give?

00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,330
Thank you.

115
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,450
Meryl, you're bleeding.

116
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,270
Stop hearing stuff.

117
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,310
Yeah, she's into...

118
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,250
She's in shock, you know?

119
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,810
Maybe sepsis.

120
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:54,530
I don't know.

121
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,230
Productivity.

122
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,490
Oh, good luck with work!

123
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:01,890
Yimayu!

124
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,210
Thank you for the final gift and thank you!

125
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,950
Meryl can become a Membu too.

126
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,370
Right before...

127
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:09,910
You know what?

128
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,750
It's perfect though if she joins Membusha because...

129
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,510
Actually, I am gonna move the Notifs because...

130
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,010
We'll move them like kind of over here.

131
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,210
So it's a little...

132
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,470
A little less invasive on the game.

133
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,130
Yeah, yeah.

134
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,630
Alright.

135
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,050
Oh geez.

136
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:27,530
Okay.

137
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,530
Guys, give me a second to, uh...

138
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:33,730
To...

139
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,470
Oh, what is this?

140
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,970
Oh, there's a mission log.

141
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,530
I was just pressing yes.

142
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:45,110
To stop the terrorists' nuclear attack, Snake must
deactivate the detonation code or destroy Metal Gear itself.

143
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,690
Snake and Meryl head for the communications tower.

144
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,450
The communications tower.

145
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,910
The only way to the underground maintenance base.

146
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,430
Foxhound members, sniper wolf fires at them.

147
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:09,530
and maryl is badly wounded it is a trap to lure out snake
snake must get up here whoa wait that's maryl in the back

148

151
00:12:52,230 --> 00:13:01,990
to beat wolf and save save Merrill Oh my gosh, it looks so
good.

152
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,030
Okay, I have a question.

153
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,070
When I'm excited about some things like this, do I sound
genuine?

154
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:17,850
Sometimes when I'm talking specifically to Matara, she'll
tell me something and I'll be like, Oh my gosh, that's cool.

155
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,110
And she's like, that's cool.

156
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,550
She kind of makes fun of me and she's like, you don't sound
like you mean it at all.

157
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,470
And I'm like, I do!

158
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,470
I'm like...

159
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:35,810
I'm...

160
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,470
But I'm actually excited.

161
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,750
You sound like a freak affectionate.

162
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,250
You know what?

163
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,550
You are a freak, Raymec.

164
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,010
You are a freak.

165
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,750
How about that?

166
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,490
Anyway.

167
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,870
I am excited.

168
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,970
I think... I get very excited, especially seeing new Yoji
Shinkawa art.

think it's the peace walker but you sound like a nerd so i

172
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:31,150
believe it stop liking that Stop liking, I can see, stop
liking that super chat.

173
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,110
You're too much of a nerd not to be genuine about your
excitement.

174
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,670
But yeah, there's this, like, gorgeous, gorgeous picture of
her, like, looking up.

175
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,370
And I was like, I just need these blown up and, like, on a,
like, framed.

176
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,650
Oh, my gosh, I want them so bad.

177
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,410
Thank you for the summertime.

178
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:51,370
Thank you.

179
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,970
Okay.

180
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,010
Let's get going, baby.

181
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,120
Okay, this is a good little area to remember how to do
stuff, right?

182
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,980
Okay, so this is to fight.

183
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,200
B is to attack.

184
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,600
This is to crouch.

185
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:26,020
For those coming in, and maybe didn't watch part one, this
is my first time, well, I guess now, this is my second time

186
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,720
ever playing on a GameCube.

187
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,420
So I'm still... What is why?

188
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,960
Is it nothing?

189
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,420
Oh, no, that's the action button.

190
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,300
That's the action button.

191
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,480
If you were Ezekai to the MGS verse, who would you want to
be reborn as?

192
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,360
Oh, maybe Sunny.

193
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,600
I feel like she has the least amount of trauma.

194
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,320
Also, it would be so cute to just make them eggs every
morning.

195
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,860
And I can see...

196
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,040
I can see all the good snake Otacon goodness, right?

197
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,000
Mei Ling?

198
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,040
Practice putting away your gun.

199
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,760
We're good.

200
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,560
We're good.

201
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,940
I think I got this.

202
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,840
I say, right now.

203
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,120
I say, okay, so we have to go back to the armory.

204
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,960
To all...

205
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,400
We have to go all the way back to the armory.

206
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,600
You know, it might be good to just...

207
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,720
Well, probably...

208
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,540
Maybe... Wait, teleport?

209
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:57,900
oh wait oh no we have to go through the nuke building we're
in the nuke building so if we go to the armory and then take

210
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:13,820
this then maybe we can go back hmm there's a psg on this
floor in the remake okay for what I understand that psg is a

211
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:30,600
what's the word is a uh tranquilizer version and yeah psg1t
and honestly the trank stuff having like doing fights with

212
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:39,580
the trank feels like it's you know like even though it
doesn't matter it doesn't truly matter like you know how is

213
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:48,140
how am i supposed to do sniper wolf scene if i use the trank
psg1 you know You are true VTuber and true Patriot Mint

214
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,640
Boss.

215
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,880
Thanks, Ronin!

216
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,500
I don't know.

217
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,300
You enjoy all the killing.

218
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,800
Only in this game.

219
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,460
Because it makes sense, right?

220
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,380
It's not in the spirit of the original work.

221
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:05,980
Exactly.

222
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,380
So I feel like I have to go all the way back.

223
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,200
Even though I don't want to.

224
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,340
I don't.

225
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,040
want to, but I feel like I have to.

226
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,440
We're just gonna hide over here while we wait.

227
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,180
Oh, it's open.

228
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,040
That was fast.

229
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,700
And up to one.

230
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,500
They die from trank overdose.

231
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,000
Maybe.

232
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,080
Oh my gosh, this area is scary.

233
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,290
This area is so scary.

234
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,770
Recently I have been feeling so sick.

235
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,750
And I was fine earlier.

236
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,910
Well, I was sick earlier and then I felt fine.

237
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,590
And now I'm starting to feel sick again.

238
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,150
Oh, no.

239
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,930
Okay, I think I'll be okay though.

240
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,530
Maybe it's just nerves.

241
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,930
Maybe it's just me being a little, like, little baby.

242
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,330
Go!

243
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:14,790
Ooh!

244
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,510
Nice for you!

245
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,770
Does he turn around?

246
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,690
Okay, this is our only chance.

247
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:28,990
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

248
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,570
He doesn't see me, right?

249
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,300
Okay.

250
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,980
This guy's gonna turn?

251
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,540
He doesn't come down, though.

252
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,420
Oh, thank God.

253
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,540
Oh, sheesh, so we almost started out real crazy.

254
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,340
Wait, okay.

255
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,540
So, just a box!

256
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,920
Just a box!

257
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,450
I can't see where everybody is.

258
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,050
Where are you guys anyway?

259
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,210
I can't see it all.

260
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,470
Okay, I'm just gonna go.

261
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,650
I don't know if we can make it into the...

262
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,290
Why are your footsteps so loud, Snake?

263
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,370
There we go.

264
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,390
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

265
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,150
Motion.

266
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,490
I think, um, I think I'm doomed.

267
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,370
Um, just a box!

268
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,490
Just a box!

269
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,750
Just a box to the heliport!

270
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,030
To the heliport, please!

271
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,190
No!

272
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,490
I didn't, oh gosh.

273
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,010
Um,

274
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,060
uh, oh, I can't use- you guys can't use weapons here either!

275
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,720
Um, you guys can't use weapons here!

00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:17,520

279
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,290
Will it work?

280
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:42,790
I wonder.

281
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,260
To the heliport, please!

282
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,140
Okay.

283
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:04,620
Wow.

284
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,460
That was so... Great start, everybody.

285
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,920
Great start.

286
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,440
That's okay.

287
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,140
That's so unfair that they can use weapons here.

288
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,080
No way.

289
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,540
That is so unfair.

290
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,420
I feel... I feel...

291
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:28,480
Like, that they should also just, you know, that is so
unfair.

292
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,380
These guys' manomachines don't care if uranium leaks from
shooting the nukes.

293
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,320
They just want to see the world burn.

294
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,420
They're gas masks, I can guarantee you.

295
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,700
I picked up the same gas mask that they are wearing, and it
is not any better.

296
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:51,040
It is not any better than, you know, I probably could, like,
knock this guy out, but whatever.

297
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:51,660
Okay.

298
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,480
Let me get down to this.

299
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,980
Oh, oh, right here.

300
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,460
Right here.

301
00:22:59,540 --> 00:22:59,680
Snake.

302
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,220
There you go.

303
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,240
Right there.

304
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:01,540
Okay.

305
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,200
It is not any better than what I'm using.

306
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,020
So these guys should be down just as much as I am.

307
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:09,620
Ugh.

308
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,960
Maybe the mask doesn't fit right.

309
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,020
What are you saying?

310
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,740
I'll have a small face or a big face.

311
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,900
Okay, you know what?

312
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,780
I'm just gonna leave.

313
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,060
I'm not even gonna...

314
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,320
I'm not even gonna...

315
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,520
Take this special way.

316
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,260
We're just gonna go the long way.

317
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,880
We're gonna...

318
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,160
Let's go.

319
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,820
Go through the door.

320
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,420
Okay.

321
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,180
Alrighty.

322
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,120
Is there anything over here?

323
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,880
Oh!

324
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,220
Do I need any ration?

325
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,240
Yes.

326
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,660
Nice.

327
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,500
Do I need also mind detectors here again?

328
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,660
Can't ever remember.

329
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,160
Oh, wow.

330
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,660
Let's just...

331
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,620
Wait, there's actually people?

332
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,830
Wait, there's people, people?

333
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,330
Oh!

334
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,710
Oh my god, there's a person!

335
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:29,970
Since when?

336
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:30,650
Oh my god.

337
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,430
Oh no.

338
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,070
No no sir.

339
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,690
You seriously didn't see anything.

340
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,570
Where are you?

341
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,650
Oh, are you coming around this way?

342
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,670
Just your imagination, dummy.

343
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,950
Can I hit him through here?

344
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,270
That'd be crazy.

345
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,430
You can't see me through the...

346
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,190
There we go.

347
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:01,490
Huh.

348
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,310
Wow, the cameras are kind of crazy out here!

349
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,270
Um, hello?

350
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,190
He didn't even notice my footsteps.

351
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,250
What?

352
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,230
Uh, uh, this guy is totally new at the job.

353
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,710
Uh, how do I get around here?

354
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,030
Okay, its range is kind of insane.

355
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,750
You know what, maybe I should...

356
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,870
Why am I making life harder for myself?

357
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,650
Oh, who saw me?

358
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,310
Oh, oh, someone saw me.

359
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,010
Oh, oh, there's people here!

360
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,350
Oh my god!

361
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:42,530
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

362
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,710
Uh, warning shots!

363
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,930
Warning, warning shots at you!

364
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,090
I can't see anything.

365
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,690
Where the hell are you?

366
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,210
Oh my god, oh my god.

367
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:55,830
Uh, let's run.

368
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,110
Oh, that's a person.

369
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,010
Ouch!

370
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,850
I tried attacking you, and I don't know what happened.

371
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,690
Um, let me in!

372
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:06,630
Let me in!

373
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,800
Why is everything so bad today?

374
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,560
Um, ouch.

375
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:18,980
Hello?

376
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:19,680
Oh!

377
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,740
I keep pressing the wrong...

378
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,860
Leave me alone!

379
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,140
Oh, this is a fight.

380
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,500
Oh, come on, man.

381
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,040
Yeah, CQC.

382
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,820
Something, something.

383
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,000
Basics of CQC.

384
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,200
Oh!

385
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,000
I thought I would be safe over here.

386
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,020
I thought there was nobody.

387
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,180
I didn't.

388
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,500
I should have just stuck right here.

389
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,260
Oh, this sucks, you guys.

390
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,800
Oh, my God.

391
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,860
This sucks.

392
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,440
Ah, what a terrible area.

393
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,380
I thought there were only just cameras out here.

394
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,260
I have to worry about people now, too.

395
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,580
I have to worry about people now, too.

396
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,040
This is the worst.

397
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,400
shoot.

398
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,860
Don't make me go through this again.

399
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,600
Please, God.

400
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,660
And I can't even hit.

401
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,840
I can't even aim.

402
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,250
Oh, ah!

403
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,780
Come investigate you!

404
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,160
Oh.

405
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,480
This needs to be a backup unit.

406
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,200
That's ridiculous.

407
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,020
Why would there need to be a backup unit?

408
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,820
Why would there need to be a... Oh, God.

409
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:00,560
Oh, God.

410
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,270
Why isn't it aiming?

411
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,830
Hello, gun.

412
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,130
Oh, there it is.

413
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,790
Because I need to press a button.

414
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,730
Sir, just go down.

415
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,490
Oh my gosh.

416
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,130
Why am I going this way?

417
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,150
Should I just go back?

418
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,970
I think I should just...

419
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,730
I hit him, right?

420
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,050
Maybe it's too far.

421
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,720
Don't kick him.

422
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:53,980
It does?

That was insane.

00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,400
Time to crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl.

437
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,660
Crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl.

438
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,580
Box, box.

00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,520
Oh, I was like, what do you mean, no use?

440
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,680
Don't tell me that.

441
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,720
It's so scary when they say that.

442
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,120
Okay, the camera is right there.

443
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,960
I can probably go in here.

444
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,180
Oh.

445
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,380
We don't see the other guy.

446
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,420
Okay.

447
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,220
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

448
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,020
Yep, yep, yep.

449
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,700
Okay, I think I see them meeting up.

450
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,300
They're doing their kissing.

451
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,210
I think I need to go.

452
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,050
Slow and steady.

453
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,790
I don't know where the other guy is.

454
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,150
That's why I'm trying to be so cautious.

455
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,610
I want to get caught.

456
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,570
Okay.

457
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:35,890
Wait.

458
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:37,950
No, that's the guy up there.

459
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:38,250
Where?

460
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,450
Okay, so he takes a really long time to get around here.

461
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,470
There he is.

462
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:43,990
Okay.

463
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,990
Surveillance camera.

464
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:47,390
Oh, yes.

465
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:47,930
Here they are.

466
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,310
They're meeting up.

467
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,030
Nope.

468
00:32:59,230 --> 00:32:59,430
Get up.

469
00:32:59,490 --> 00:32:59,730
Get up.

470
00:32:59,770 --> 00:32:59,990
Snake.

00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:00,770
Snake, please.

Okay.

474
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,490
All right.

475
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,390
Okay.

476
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,310
We're all good.

477
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,230
Notice me.

478
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,890
I'm just a little far away.

479
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,810
I'm just a precious, innocent little box.

480
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,290
I just want to go to the heliport.

481
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,910
Is this all there is to load?

482
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,210
Mm-hmm.

483
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,790

00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,110

00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,890

00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:27,850
He was sleeping.

Yeah, but he'll wake up.

00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,050
What?

533
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:13,890
This is like class A, like micromanaging.

534
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:20,950
The fact that he has to like send a little status report
every two seconds is insane.

535
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,990
Your manager must be so annoying.

536
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,270
Just always nothing here.

537
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,470
Nothing here.

538
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:30,850
Like, I think I would go insane if someone kept reporting
that to me.

539
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,990
Every two seconds.

540
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,790
Nothing here.

541
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,970
Nothing here.

542
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,050
Nothing here.

543
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,970
I'm a little fish.

544
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,930
I'm a little fish in the sea.

545
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,570
I'm a little drowning fish.

546
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,590
I'm going to get out of the water.

547
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,510
The RTO is just lonely.

548
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:54,770
I get that.

549
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,110
He'd be a little less lonely if there was something here,
though.

550
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,010
Nothing here.

551
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:09,890
I love the way they say it in MGS2 Nothing here

552
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:20,880
Okay Sounds very close Where are you?

553
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,990
You are the true VTuber Thank you!

554
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,010
Thank you so much.

555
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,050
Oh, there he is.

556
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,810
If I get him, though.

557
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,550
I think the footsteps I'm hearing are the guy upstairs.

558
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:43,410
Right?

559
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,610
Okay, he's doing his thing, going around.

560
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,950
If I get him, though, he's gonna...

561
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,270
They're gonna do a status report, but I feel like I have to
get him.

562
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:54,770
There's nothing here.

563
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,650
There's no...

564
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,270
Okay, yeah.

565
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:15,790
Where is he?

566
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,130
What?

567
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:20,650
What?

568
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,490
That way!

569
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:22,930
No way.

570
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,210
Um, can you just... Oh, um, uh...

571
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:26,950
Wait, hold on!

572
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:27,630
Hold on!

573
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,670
I'm just gonna go back and... Oh, shoot.

574
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,110
Uh, I didn't even see you.

575
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:32,790
Go away.

576
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,470
Yeah, go away.

577
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:34,930
Ouch.

578
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,510
Ouch, ouch.

579
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,750
Um... How the heck did you see?

580
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,750
Oh my god, Snake, just go back to your hole.

581
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,470
Just go back to the hole, Snake!

582
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:42,670
Where's the hole?

583
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:43,730
There it is.

584
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,630
Crawl, crawl.

585
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:45,850
Crawl on in.

586
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,070
No pursuit!

587
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:57,130
mean you're not gonna crawl after me are you that would be
ridiculous oh no can

588
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,840
you see me

589
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:34,070
mmm oh my gosh you and your perfect vision why don't they
ever hire guys that need glasses huh Billy welcome the

590
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,190
membership thank you

591
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:39,690
Um...

592
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,750
Yeah, I'll hug the walls next time.

593
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:48,670
You know, the CQC jump kick really sells me on the idea that
this is Otakon's retelling of the Shadow Bros system.

594
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,410
They hired Otakon.

595
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,090
Yeah, but that guy's like, he, you know, he's a nerd.

596
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,790
They really just said nothing here.

597
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,010
Oh!

598
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,710
We're calling you to a team.

599
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:04,690
We're a team.

600
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:05,190
I'm

601
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,320
a...

602
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,060
Oh!

603
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,540
Where are they going?

604
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,740
Where do they... Oh, I don't think there's a door in there.

605
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,480
I don't think there's another...

606
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,280
Where do they go to?

607
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,600
Hmm, where...

608
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,280
Where do they go to?

609
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:32,960
Have you ever watched animated parodies of Metal Gear games
like Metal Gear Awesome or... I did watch Crab Battle

610
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,620
before, yeah.

611
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,400
I think I watched Metal Gear Awesome as a kid.

612
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,620
Mint is cute today also, but not as cute as Snake.

613
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,660
No one's as cute.

614
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,280
is snake.

615
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,980
But thanks for the super chat.

616
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,700
They hired a whole Otaku convention, exactly.

617
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,260
Nothing here.

618
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,340
Yeah, nothing here.

619
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,800
Oh my gosh.

620
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,460
This guy sucks so much.

621
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:58,940
Oh, whoops.

622
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,160
It's because I'm crawling.

623
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:10,660
It's still taking me a second to get used to which one is
what is what is crawl and what is an odd.

624
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,240
and all that fun stuff, you know.

625
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,000
No, I don't want to go in there.

626
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,460
I'm hugging the walls.

627
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,860
I'm hugging the walls.

628
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,500
Where's our friend who comes over here?

629
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,200
Is he going to come over here?

630
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,980
Actually, I don't know.

631
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,880
I don't know his patrol route.

632
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,540
Lucky Nag, welcome to membership, thank you!

633
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,160
Oh.

634
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:40,660
Oh.

635
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,980
He thought he saw me.

636
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,340
Oh my gosh.

637
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,980
Wait, did he just say...

638
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,820
He didn't say just a box or anything, right?

639
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,540
There he is.

640
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,720
Okay, he's reporting.

641
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,720
Nothing here.

642
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,440
Nothing here.

643
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,240
One thing I really want to learn to get better at is, like,
getting the...

644
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,540
Shooting the...

645
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,020
What's it called?

646
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,680
You know, the...

647
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,040
Uh, the...

648
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,420
The remote.

649
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,400
Babe.

650
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:17,600
Okay.

651
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,880
Trust your instincts as a soldier.

652
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,620
Yeah, the radio!

653
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,680
What did I call it?

654
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,140
I don't know what I called it.

655
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,080
Uh, B1?

656
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:27,920
No, B2.

657
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,820
It was B2.

658
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,040
Yeah, the radios.

659
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,560
Wait, can I actually go in here?

660
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,380
Ah, 6.

661
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,900
Did I hear something?

662
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,000
Oh, it was...

663
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,820
I heard the music.

664
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,640
Yeah, get in the radio.

665
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,540
Oh, that B2.

666
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,640
I could never get down shooting the radio in any game.

667
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,280
It's really, I mean, it's like the tiniest target, right?

668
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,380
Oh my god.

669
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,060
Oh my god, that guy was right there.

670
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,180
I think every time I start, he's always right there.

671
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,220
Okay, PSG is somewhere.

672
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,100
Somewhere in here.

673
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,660
Alright, let's just let these guys kind of do...

674
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:26,660
Oh!

675
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,300
Rendezvous!

676
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:40,770
Just gotta go for it.

677
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,650
Oh my god, the trap is still open.

678
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:47,610
This side.

679
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:49,130
Uh, C4.

680
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:50,210
Nikita.

681
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,190
Does he come around here?

682
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,110
Oh my god.

683
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:53,730
Ah!

684
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:54,230
No!

685
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:54,970
No!

686
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:55,790
I didn't!

687
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:56,550
I didn't beat you!

688
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:04,640
No?

689
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,320
No, I'm just a box!

690
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,120
I'm...

691
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,360
Ah!

692
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,340
This is so messed up.

693
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,400
This is so...

694
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,800
This is so...

695
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,700
This is so messed up.

696
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,340
I can't believe you could turn on the safety on this thing.

697
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,360
I guess maybe if you're trying to hold up someone and you,
uh...

698
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,680
You don't want to...

699
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,460
You don't want to kill them for real?

700
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,600
Okay, let's see.

701
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,460
How do I get out of this predicament?

702
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:38,740
Hmm...

703
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,020
Okay, I'm on rations.

704
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,580
I'm slowly standing up.

705
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,140
And fire!

706
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,100
Fire!

707
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:47,660
Fire!

708
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,840
Whoever is...

709
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,060
Oh, I'm not firing at anyone!

710
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,120
Oh my god.

711
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,180
Um...

712
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:53,600
I'm...

713
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:53,700
Oh!

714
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,180
Kill you!

715
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,120
Hey!

716
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,200
Hey!

717
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,320
Oh my gosh.

718
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,100
You don't think they'll see me right here, right?

719
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,080
I hate!

720
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,780
I hurt you!

721
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,600
Why do you have to be...

722
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,920
Oh my god, where did you come from?

723
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,840
Oh, I'm so far away from you.

724
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,740
Yeah, yeah.

725
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:29,940
Stop!

726
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:30,700
Stop!

727
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,600
Stop it!

728
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,540
Leave me alone!

729
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,400
Okay, let's retry that.

730
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,020
Let's... Maybe there's a ration in here.

731
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,460
I can run.

732
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:47,980
Oh!

733
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,240
Oh.

734
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:51,880
Oh.

735
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,500
Oh my god.

736
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:53,960
Oh!

737
00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:07,400
so close to using that other ashen my i panicked and like my
and i like did a little 360 with my with the stick okay

738
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:17,760
let's see there's some stuff in here probably right yeah
there's still some stuff in here oh get everything but it

739
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:24,340
anything in there here probably can unequip this nice okay
Let's just take a little bit of stuff.

740
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,720
All according to plan, of course, as always.

741
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:33,720
It was obviously my intention to just get more stuff.

742
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:35,660
Duh.

743
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,540
Nothing under here.

744
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,540
Meryl, you stingy.

745
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,240
Just as planned.

746
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,100
Nasty.

747
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:51,960
More books.

748
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,200
I'll take it.

749
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,600
Is there anything...

750
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,160
Oh, wait.

751
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,820
I'll take it.

752
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,180
I can't take it.

753
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,260
Too many of it.

754
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,060
And I don't think...

755
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,400
Was there...

756
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:07,720
Hmm.

757
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:08,940
What?

758
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,400
I think there's stuff up here.

759
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,480
Climb.

760
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:16,840
Oh.

761
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,100
I can't climb it anymore.

762
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
It won't let me go into the vents.

763
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,240
I can go into these vents, though.

764
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:25,760
Okay.

765
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,240
Who would have...

766
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:35,380
thunk that it would take it would be this difficult oh yeah
i knew it that would be this difficult just to get the dang

767
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:48,680
psg well difficult for me all right one thing i love though
about this game is when you are down and then you press to

768
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:55,840
stand back up it doesn't put you just into the crouch it
actually stands you up because that would get me so many

769
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:04,020
games where i would be like lying down and I'll be trying to
stand up and then I stood up like this you know oh yeah save

770
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:17,780
good plan wait um with a yes start and a button okay
Campbell stay out of her range and shoot at her with a

771
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:25,480
sniper rifle yeah but where can I find a sniper rifle I
can't ask Merrill what about Dr. Emmerich he's been on the

772
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,420
base for a while he might know I wonder if he tells me that
there's one, that there's the...

773
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,960
The what's it called one?

774
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,020
Otagon.

775
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,280
Have you ever seen a sniper rifle anywhere on this base?

776
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,680
A sniper rifle?

777
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,720
Merrill's been shot by an extremely good sniper.

778
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:42,820
Sniper.

779
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:43,700
Sniper.

780
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,840
A high quality sniper rifle is the only way I can fight
back.

781
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,140
I wonder if he tells me about the Tranquil.

782
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,640
I saw one in the armory in the second floor basement of the
tank hangar.

783
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,040
The second floor basement of the tank hangar.

784
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,620
I have to go all the way back there.

785
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,520
It's literally me.

786
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:57,580
Yeah.

787
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,680
What's wrong with you, Otacon?

788
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,060
Oh, nothing.

789
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,440
He sounds so...

790
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,240
So shy.

791
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,260
So like...

792
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,240
Nothing.

793
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,660
You know...

794
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,100
Don't worry about him.

795
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,040
This...

796
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:14,840
He wouldn't...

797
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,980
He wouldn't get it, you know.

798
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:16,840
There's nothing.

799
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,580
You need to make snap decisions.

800
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,700
In war, the difference between living and dying is counted
in milliseconds.

801
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:25,480
True.

802
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,140
I made good ones.

803
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,800
I made good ones, Master.

804
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,040
Like turning around.

805
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,260
You cannot win without a sniper rifle.

806
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,280
You cannot save the girl either.

807
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,160
Find a sniper rifle.

808
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,380
It is the only way to save Meryl.

809
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,000
Only way.

810
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:43,640
Mealing.

811
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,460
I could have used your advice, you know?

812
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,080
You called Snake?

813
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:46,560
I did.

814
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,960
Let's save since we're here.

815
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,100
We're gonna save.

816
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,320
Yes.

817
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,020
Whatever you say, Nastasha.

818
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:57,820
Yeah.

819
00:49:59,060 --> 00:49:59,340
All right.

820
00:49:59,600 --> 00:49:59,700
B.

821
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,280
There's a Chinese proverb.

822
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:07,680
The mind cannot be in two places at once.

823
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,960
Make sure you're not thinking of something else during the
mission, okay?

824
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,580
I'm thinking of you, baby girl.

825
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:14,300
Sorry.

826
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:16,700
Okay.

827
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:22,800
Okay.

828
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:22,980
Okay.

829
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,440
Okay.

830
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,280
The codex are so, the audio is so low.

831
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,600
Okay, back to B2.

832
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,340
I don't even know where the PSG is.

833
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,560
I was just going...

834
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,660
I was going the...

835
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,020
I don't even know if I was going the right way.

836
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,080
I don't even know.

837
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:55,740
Wait.

838
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,980
Oh, those guys are still knocked out.

839
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,560
No way.

840
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,160
Wait a second.

841
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,020
No way.

842
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,260
No way.

843
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:17,150
Yeah, I'm gonna trank them.

844
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:22,250
I have to make sure I do this correctly, though.

845
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:22,990
You know?

846
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:24,050
Okay.

847
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:29,340
Oh.

848
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:42,560
Never mind.

849
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,500
Never mind.

850
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,880
Never mind.

851
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,750
Well, they can't take the elevator because it's occupied.

852
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:00,090
I wish I could shoot from the box, man.

853
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,250
Oh, nice to be able to shoot from the box.

854
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:09,050
They won't look in here, right?

855
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,550
I just gotta wait it out a little bit.

856
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:17,990
Too OP?

857
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:19,530
Probably, yeah.

858
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:21,730
Look at this guy.

859
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:23,730
What are you doing over there in the corner?

860
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:24,990
Oh, yeah.

861
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:26,890
Go look around.

862
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:27,930
Do your job.

863
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:28,850
Do your job.

864
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,850
There's a maniac on the loose.

865
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:32,790
He's absolutely wild.

866
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:34,230
Oh, there he goes.

867
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,030
Stay sharp, everybody.

868
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:41,790
Okay, they have a reset it.

869
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:42,690
Very good.

870
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:43,670
Very nice.

871
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:44,410
Okay.

872
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:46,290
Okay.

873
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:48,190
This guy's gonna come.

874
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:50,010
He's gonna be like, ooh, ah.

875
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:58,370
The reason I keep going to the right is because, um, well, I
guess my left.

876
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:05,910
The left, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
the, the, the, the, the, the, You know where I'm going.

877
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:11,230
The reason I keep going that way is because I'm most
familiar with that guy's pattern.

878
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:14,650
That guy's his route, so it's a little easier for me.

879
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:20,950
The radar?

880
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:23,670
Right.

881
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:24,770

Yeah.

A little left.

Is he coming down?

These guys gang up.

00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:38,090
That's why I got caught.

899
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:41,390
Okay, this guy goes down and he comes this way.

900
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:42,870
Yeah.

901
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,570
And then he goes up.

902
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:45,310
He stops there.

903
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:46,650
Turned around?

904
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,690
Turned around.

905
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:50,410
Then he goes up.

906
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:53,570
You.

907
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,340
Is this it?

908
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,300
Duh, this is the hand grenades.

909
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:04,880
Dang it.

910
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:14,050
Every second you wait, Meryl gets close to death.

911
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:15,190
Good.

912
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:17,430
Good.

913
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,850
Are they camping it up there?

914
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:24,390
It's not that one up there, is it?

915
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:26,130
It can't be that one.

916
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,150
The one that the guy is literally standing in front of?

917
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:29,630
It can't be that one, right?

918
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,700
How do I get past this guy?

919
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:06,590
I can't see it.

920
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:09,130
Just a box.

921
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:13,710
Just a box.

922
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,250
I think he's right in front of it.

923
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:16,510
I think it's that one.

924
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:19,170
Just trank him.

925
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:19,650
I'm scared.

926
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:21,750
Hold on.

927
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:22,030
Okay.

928
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:23,370
Okay.

929
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:23,890
Okay.

930
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:26,610
Once the bottom guy goes to the top.

931
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:31,250
We're gonna run right past him when he turned around.

932
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:33,470
I think he looks here.

933
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:35,470
Yeah, he looks down here.

934
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:37,450
And he goes up.

935
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:38,730
And...

936
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:41,310
Don't notice me.

937
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:42,530
Please, God.

938
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,380
Okay.

939
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,280
We're just gonna have to blast through him and then go up.

940
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,420
We're gonna...

941
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:15,860
We're gonna blast through him!

942
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,700

Do you think?

953
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,840
Oh, we have no more rush!

954
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:44,940
It's over!

955
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,180
Now, why does a thing have to be there?

956
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,320

00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:53,840

The red line means it's open?

01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:16,970
I'm guessing?

1022
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:27,470
You can see in the mini-map if it's open.

1023
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:29,150
I couldn't tell before, though.

1024

Okay.

01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:41,300
So now...

1053
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,560
Do you think there's that ration back there again?

1054
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,260
No wonder.

1055
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,160
Gonna be kind of awesome.

01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:48,180

Bashamin!

1058
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:56,770
Hello!

1059
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:58,330
No.

1060
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:03,170
Imagine if you fell into that hole.

1061
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,550
What do you take me as a rookie?

1062
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:11,970
I could not see that first one, though.

1063
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:13,270
Okay, how do I want to do this?

1064
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:14,030
Let's see.

1065
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:21,590
I'm going to go to the Kusalan concert tomorrow, but I've
never gone to a concert by myself before.

1066
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:22,170
It's not a concert.

1067
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:22,750
concert.

1068
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:24,210
It's like...

1069
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:27,310
It's like...

1070
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:28,830
It's like...

1071
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,490
It's so, so casual.

1072
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:33,750
Like, just wear whatever you want.

1073
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:36,250
It's just people playing anime music.

1074
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:37,090
That's all it is.

1075
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:41,250
It's just people playing anime music.

1076
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:42,530
Yeah.

1077
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:47,010
So...

1078
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:49,310
Don't feel like you have to dress up or dress up.

1104
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:49,500
So, like, for example, part of, like, um, for example, part
of, like, Atchan from AKB, she was, like, the center for AKB

1105
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,100

1129
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:31,520

1133
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,620
Do you think if I go back, I'll be fine?

1134
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:14,500
Why did he kick the guard?

1135
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,620

work That might work.

1140
01:13:56,540 --> 01:14:01,180

much of a scene.

1141
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:02,820
Maybe.

1142
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,320

1143
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,220
Yeah, there's...

1144
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:09,820
Well, the camera is what the chaff grenade would be for.

1145
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,520
Throw a magazine to lure him away.

1146
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:16,380
He'll come back, though, right?

1147
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:23,250

01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:30,330
M9 full.

1250
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:33,570
Oh, it's a psychomantus area.

1251
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:34,510
Oh, my bad.

1252
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:37,350
For some reason, I thought it was in here.

1253
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:41,230
Anything in here?

1254
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:45,210
The lady magazine is worth it.

1255
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:46,410
Probably.

1256
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:49,310
I keep pressing the action button for...

1257
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:51,050
Oh, oh, oh.

1258
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:56,190
I keep pressing the action button for trying to look.

1259
01:22:58,010 --> 01:22:59,450
in first person.

1260
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,030
I think I wasted enough time.

1261
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:05,510
I think we can just kind of go to Meryl.

1262
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:09,030
I think I wasted enough time.

1263
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:15,070
When I was playing the Master Collection, I thought of you
and I used your box method.

1264
01:23:15,210 --> 01:23:16,310
It's actually very effective.

1265
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:17,250
It is.

1266
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:20,970
The box is awesome.

1267
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:23,570
The box is life.

1268
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:24,510
You know?

1269
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:28,290
I only remember this area MGS4?

1270
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:29,190
Really?

1271
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:38,100
Okay, I was gonna say I think Metal Gear Solid is the one
that I remembered the most of.

1272
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:46,460
Actually, when I do think about it, I think, um...

1273
01:23:46,460 --> 01:24:04,080
Like, the point between getting caught by um, by Ocelot
like, you know, in the getting tortured by Ocelot and and

1274
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:15,200
going down the elevator to Vulcan Raven I'm like I know I
fight the Hinde but I just I think I've erased that whole

1275
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:22,440
spot out of my brain like I cannot remember ever what goes
on in between there like I know I have to go up the

1276
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:28,060
communications tower but I'm like how do I get there and
then I have to fight the guys in the elevator but I'm like

1277
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:39,140
when do I do that like it's just i think it's maybe i don't
want to say the most like memorable spot but it's like kind

1278
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:53,820
of unmemorable you know in a way i think it's torture tower

1285
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:11,350
Time to take your pills.

1286
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:13,750
Wait.

1287
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:15,510
Uh, gas map.

1288
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:15,910
Oh, no.

1289
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:17,890
Wait, why am I over there?

1290
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:20,410
Why am I in third person all of a sudden?

1291
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:21,110
Who am I?

1292
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:23,630
Who's observing me?

1293
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:25,650
Who are you?

1294
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:26,430
Huh?

1295
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:27,630
Wait, huh?

1296
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:29,370
Oh.

1297
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:33,150
Oh, okay, okay.

1298
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:35,270
Um, can I lay down with this?

1299
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:36,370
Or, um, no.

1300
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:42,750
Rouch.

1301
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:44,010
Lay.

1302
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:45,430
Turn.

1303
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:46,430
Equip.

1304
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,060
Where's the...

1305
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:54,420
I never can get the best angle for this, you know?

1306
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,780
I can never figure it out.

1307
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,200
Can I just do it in first person?

1308
01:26:59,480 --> 01:26:59,660
Actually?

1309
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:00,000
Oh.

1310
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:00,980
Hey, girly.

1311
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,420
Uh, B and fire!

1312
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,400
Oh, ow.

1313
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:10,220
Oh, my meds.

1314
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:11,840
I need my meds.

1315
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,440
Oh, I don't even need to lay down?

1316
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:14,460
Wait.

1317
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:17,120
I don't even need to lay down.

1318
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:18,860
It's kind of OP, right?

1319
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,180
You're gonna look this way.

1320
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:25,700
You're gonna look this way.

1321
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,040
Oh, shoot.

1322
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:29,940
Oh, I was so close.

1323
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:30,700
I was...

1324
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:31,300
Oh, my God.

1325
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:32,020
Oh, my God.

1326
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:39,270
Yep.

1327
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:40,250
There she goes.

1328
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:41,290
Okay.

1329
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:42,750
Ouchie.

1330
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:47,960
Hi.

1331
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:49,020
Where are you?

1332
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:49,720
Madam?

1333
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:50,860
Hold on.

1334
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:51,880
I can't see anything.

1335
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:53,520
Let's go this way.

1336
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,520
Do I need to be crouching at all?

1337
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:58,560
I shot her in the cleavage?

1338
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,260
Exactly all according to plan.

1339
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:09,020
Can I just be...

1340
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:15,950
I literally don't even have to be...

1341
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:16,650
Oh my gosh.

1342
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:17,450
This is insane.

1343
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:18,490
I don't have to be sitting.

1344
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:20,510
Is it probably better...

1345
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:21,610
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1346
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,210
It might be better...

1347
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:27,250
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1348
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:30,190
Maybe better...

1349
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:40,590
Like...

1350
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:42,530
Yes, your hands tremble less.

1351
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:47,330
That's what I... that's the word better like stability
stability is the word that I was thinking of.

1352
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:51,230
Oh my god You guys how do you even stand me?

1353
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:57,450
Good angle for you.

1354
01:28:57,710 --> 01:28:58,550
Hello, madam.

1355
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:10,050
Oh, I must take my meds I must take my meds ma'am Got you
Got you.

1356
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:13,030
Oh, and you got me I did a little...

1357
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:14,510
Where are you?

1358
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:15,290
Oh, uh...

1359
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:16,450
Wait, actually, where are you?

1360
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,400
I'm throwing our offer game, you know?

1361
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:26,960
Okay.

1362
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:30,980
Now I zoom in and I take my meds.

1363
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:36,660
I know... I don't know why I cycle through the whole thing
every time.

1364
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:37,460
Oh!

1365
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:44,280
Oh, she's gonna...

1366
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:44,860
Oh, never mind.

1367
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:45,260
Oh.

1368
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,040
So sensitive.

1369
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:57,000
Got your cleavage!

1370
01:29:57,980 --> 01:29:59,600
I got your cleavage!

1371
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,360
So sensitive!

1372
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,870
Oh, kind of shaky.

1373
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:18,950
What did he say?

1374
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:29,520
There's no cameras here yet.

1375
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:31,900
If I remember correctly.

1376
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:40,010
The heartbeat?

1377
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:49,250
Thought I heard like a little heart... Oh, yeah, there's
like kind of like a really slow heartbeat like sound.

1378
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:54,190
Oh, oh, goodness.

1379
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:55,670
Oh, goodness.

1380
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:57,430
There is a camera there.

1381
01:30:59,810 --> 01:31:00,950
I knew it.

1382
01:31:03,530 --> 01:31:03,870
Hmm.

1383
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:05,590
I want that, though.

1384
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:10,220
I can get it.

1385
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:12,960
Oh, snake.

1386
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:13,600
Look this way.

1387
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,440
I can get it.

1388
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:16,940
Run!

1389
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,900
It was worth.

1390
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:20,320
Okay.

1391
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:21,480
Okay, let's go.

1392
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:26,520
La la la.

1393
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:27,980
Picking up the stuff.

1394
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:30,080
Oh, oh.

1395
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:31,220
Oh.

1396
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:35,060
This game is way more generous on health items.

1397
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:37,520
But you know what I haven't picked up?

1398
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:40,580
I haven't picked very many chaff grenades.

1399
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,980
They have not picked so many chaff grenades.

1400
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:45,100
No, no, no, not yet.

1401
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:56,590
But...

1402
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:57,370
Look at the rods.

1403
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:01,340
There we go.

1404
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:08,350
Oh, Kodak calls before progress.

1405
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:09,230
You're so right.

1406
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:09,850
I should have done it.

1407
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:10,550
I'm so sorry.

1408
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:15,870
Robin, it's me.

1409
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:17,250
Starfire!

1410
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,500
You do not wish to hurt me, Robin.

1411
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:33,110
Woo!

1412
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:33,850
Woo!

1413
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:36,410
Whoa!

1414
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:44,600
It's hard to miss when you're this close.

1415
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:45,820
That's yeah.

1416
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:50,840
It's kind of weird that you're using your sniper on me right
here.

1417
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:55,560
Something I would do.

1418
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,940
That wasn't slow.

1419
01:32:59,160 --> 01:32:59,380
Whoa!

1420
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:00,780
The triple kick!

1421
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:03,940
You're a fool to come back here.

1422
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:06,220
Stupid man.

1423
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:08,220
Sorry.

1424
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:10,140
A lady sniper, huh?

1425
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:17,040
Don't you know that the majority of the world's great
assassins are women?

1426
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:17,620
Yeah!

1427
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,700
Do you want to die now?

1428
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,500
Or after your female friend?

1429
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:24,040
Which will it be?

1430
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:25,100
Oh my god.

1431
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:28,160
I'll die after I kill you.

1432
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,220
Is that right?

1433
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:35,860
Well, at least you could spirit.

1434
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:37,920
You okay, Robin?

1435
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:38,840
Yeah!

1436
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,200
Sometimes she even falls in love with them.

1437
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:47,080
I am sniper wolf.

1438
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:49,980
And I always kill what I aim.

1439
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,120
Snake's eyes here are...

1440
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:53,080
They're like...

1441
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:56,700
His eyes are like bulging out of his head.

1442
01:33:58,180 --> 01:33:58,820
Oh!

1443
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:02,140
I've left my mark on you.

1444
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,000
Oh my gosh.

1445
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:04,820
I won't forget it.

1446
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:06,840
Wow.

1447
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:27,300

him away what do you mean why did you act all tough Yes, I

1449
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,540
will take it alive.

1450
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,260
Leave it to me.

1451
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:48,100
I want no more accidents like that DARPA chief.

1452
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:50,740
Like that DARPA chief.

1453
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:52,300
He's my target.

1454
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,020
Mine alone.

1455
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:56,040
It is Robin, I thought it was a bit.

1456
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:56,540
No!

1457
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,020
I was like, hi, Hannah!

1458
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,480
On her mind, rent-free, for real, for real.

1459
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:03,840
Yeah.

1460
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,360
Bro was lagging.

1461
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:21,240
can you hear me solid snake oh brother do you know who I am
I always knew that one day I would meet you I like that we

1462
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:30,620

life because of you forget it your body is strapped down

1463
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:31,940
Uh-huh.

Uh, isolate.

1465
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:38,800
I'm the man from whom you stole everything good.

1466
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:48,540
And now, after the sacrifice of our brothers, after thirty
long years, finally, the two of us meet.

1467
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:53,220
The brother of light and the brother of dark.

1468
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:57,920
Let me add this.

1469
01:35:57,940 --> 01:35:59,940
We will need his genetic information too.

1470
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:09,460

correct the genome soldiers mutations then we'll be able to

hands on big boss's they're only 179 a i kill have they

And also, I'm not going to submit immediately in case you
guys are wondering as well.

1474
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:43,600
About their precious new nuclear weapon.

1475
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,320
Boss, it looks like our friend is awake.

1476
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:49,400
Who are you talking to before then?

1477
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:50,860
Were you not talking to me?

1478
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,740
Like, did you think I was asleep talking to me like that?

1479
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,020
Whoa, why are we so red?

1480
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:10,520

brother little brother

1483
01:37:37,410 --> 01:37:38,270
Who's calling?

1484
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:39,310
It's me.

1485
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:42,250
It's me.

1486
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:43,070
Then what?

1487
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:45,810
I'm the only British person here.

1488
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:48,510
There's a ninja on the loose.

1489
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:50,250
All right, Raven.

1490
01:37:50,610 --> 01:37:51,450
I'll be right there.

1491
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:54,810
Moshi Moshi.

1492
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:56,890
They're not responding to our demands.

1493
01:37:57,610 --> 01:38:00,350
We'll launch the first one in 10 hours as planned.

1494
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:00,950
Oh my god.

1495
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:01,750
No!

1496
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:02,130
No!

1497
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:06,430
Looks like you read them wrong.

1498
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:09,410
You mean just...

1499
01:38:09,410 --> 01:38:11,170
Don't point that thing at me, Ocelot.

1500
01:38:11,370 --> 01:38:12,130
Something's funny.

1501
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:16,750
Normally, the Americans are the first ones to the
negotiating table.

1502
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:20,530
They must think they've got something up their sleeves.

1503
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:24,570
So it's come down to it, has it?

1504
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:28,570
We're gonna launch that nuke and write it all the way into
history.

1505
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:30,990
Write it all... Oh, remember the alibi, baby.

1506
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:33,050
I've got to take care of some launch preparations.

1507
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:35,010
You're in charge here, Ocelot.

1508
01:38:36,470 --> 01:38:37,170
What about you?

1509
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:39,170
Want to stay for the show?

1510
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:42,070
I'm not interested.

1511
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:48,490
Yeah.

1512
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:50,170
Take your meds.

1513
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:53,550
Oh, nice.

1514
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:54,150
Nice.

1515
01:38:54,290 --> 01:38:56,370
It's time to feed the family.

1516
01:38:56,450 --> 01:38:58,230
Nice cinematography here.

1517
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:02,750
So, you prefer your wolves to my show, hmm?

1518
01:39:03,050 --> 01:39:03,410
Hmm?

1519
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:03,730
Hmm?

1520
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:07,650
Ocelot, don't screw up like you did with the chief.

1521
01:39:10,630 --> 01:39:11,490
Yes, I know.

1522
01:39:12,230 --> 01:39:13,250
That was an accident.

1523
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:18,670
I didn't think a pencil pusher like him would be so tough.

1524
01:39:20,630 --> 01:39:24,410
Well, his mental defenses were reinforced by hypnotherapy.

1525
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:25,790
Gosh, they love hypnotherapy.

1526
01:39:27,650 --> 01:39:29,650
Where can I get me some of that hypnotherapy?

1527
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:32,250
I mean, actually, just regular therapy.

1528
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:45,590
man whoever he is he's some kind of lunatic 12 guys bastard
took my hand how could you've gotten in here perhaps there's

1529
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:58,430

got to find out what killed baker and octopus we're

1530
01:39:58,430 --> 01:40:04,550
short-handed so make this little torture show of yours as
short No, no, no.

1531
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:06,350
Decoy Octopus is still alive.

1532
01:40:06,490 --> 01:40:07,350
We haven't fought him yet.

1533
01:40:07,570 --> 01:40:09,010
This is an interrogation.

1534
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:14,830
Oh my god, his nipples were long.

1535
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:17,090
See you later, brother.

1536
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:18,330
Brother?

1537
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:22,410
Oh no.

1538
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:23,730
He's still alive.

1539
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:24,450
Decoy Octopus.

1540
01:40:24,630 --> 01:40:25,550
We haven't seen him yet.

1541
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,360
She's so awesome.

1542
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:36,420
I get, you know what, Otakon, I get it.

1543
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:38,680
Oh!

1544
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:39,800
Oh, sorry.

1545
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:42,340
Your woman is still in this world.

1546
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:44,060
That was really close.

1547
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:44,720
To come here.

1548
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:45,700
Meryl.

1549
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:55,840
He's like...

1550
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:56,760
God, I wish that were...

1551
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:57,680
What are you laughing at?

1552
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:58,860
What are you laughing at?

1553
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:00,180
What?

1554
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:03,380
What?

1555
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:07,720
What is all of this implying?

1556
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:10,120
What

1557
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:15,020

1558
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:27,800

little kiss on the cheek she doesn't think about anything

that's so funny it's not like floating like in the original.

1564
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,160
Washington was taking quite a chance sending you here.

1565
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,900
Someone must have a lot of faith in your skill, hmm?

1566
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,160
Carrier boy!

hypnotherapy to stare into the suspicious app that appeared

1580
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:49,480
on my phone what does that mean oh no he's you're going to
play a game solid He's not a revolver.

1581
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:51,720
I will find out what kind of man you really are.

1582
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:54,900
When the pain becomes too great to bear, he can't revolve.

1583
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:57,220
Just give up and your suffering will end.

1584
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:01,700
But if you do, the girl's life is mine.

1585
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:04,720
Okay.

1586
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:09,320
They nerfed him.

1587
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:14,840
Press the resist button repeatedly to regain your strength.

1588
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:15,480
Wait, what's the resist button?

1589
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:17,700
When you've had enough, Wait.

1590
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:19,980
Wait, wait, wait.

1591
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:20,920
Ocelot, what's the...

1592
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:23,320
When your life reaches zero, the game is over.

1593
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:25,120
Should have saved.

1594
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,780
There are no continues, my friend.

1595
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:27,760
Oh gosh, I should have saved.

1596
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:31,560
Don't even think about using auto fire, but I'll know.

1597
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:33,240
Oh, he's looking at me!

1598
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:36,960
It's been a long time since you saved your game.

1599
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:38,140
Yeah?

1600
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:39,360
So what?

1601
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:44,160
If your body can't survive the torture, it'll be game over.

1602
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:45,240
He even knows.

1603
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:47,040
You really want to travel down that long?

1604
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:48,820
Wait, he knows!

1605
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,040
Come on, I won't tell.

1606
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:52,880
Why don't you just give up?

1607
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:57,600
I'm going to run a high voltage electric current through
your body.

1608
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:01,020
If it's just for a short time, it won't kill you.

1609
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,140
Wait, what is the resist button?

1610
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:02,880
Oh gosh.

1611
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:06,120
Did you know that it was the French who first thought of
using electrical shocks?

1612
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:08,020
Of course it was the French.

1613
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:11,280
Hey, French films are all right.

1614
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,140
But I don't care about that crap.

1615
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,700
You're a tough guy, Snake.

project was not a total failure One man who could make my

1624
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:58,220
dream into a reality.

1625
01:46:58,540 --> 01:47:00,200
What is that project?

1626
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:01,160
Oh.

1627
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,640
Take me home, Robin.

1628
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:21,240
Oh, I like how at the start of every, like, changing angle

resets.

1630
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:22,540
It's so funny.

1631
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:24,500
Johnny!

1632
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:26,460
Where?

1633
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:30,220
Ah!

1634
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:33,320
Looks like I got a roommate.

1635
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:37,720
He don't look so good.

1636
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:42,970
Decoy octopus.

1637
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:52,190
Oh my god!

1638
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:53,930
That's disgusting!

1639
01:47:54,530 --> 01:47:56,950
Oh my god, that- wait, that is actually disgusting.

1640
01:47:57,130 --> 01:47:57,710
The DARPA chief.

1641
01:47:58,330 --> 01:47:59,410
Oh, gross!

1642
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:00,990
What a stench!

1643
01:48:00,990 --> 01:48:01,430
What a stench!

1644
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:03,890
You couldn't tell when you first came in?

1645
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:08,250
That is some severe...

1646
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:08,490
Ooh.

1647
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:10,730
Lord.

1648
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:12,670
Ding.

1649
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:17,700
Snake, are you okay?

1650
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:19,300
I've been better.

1651
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,420
House Meryl.

1652
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:22,020
They got her.

1653
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:22,380
Oh.

1654
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:23,160
Damn.

1655
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:25,560
Okay.

1656
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:26,880
I know.

1657
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:32,060
Snake, the government has decided not to give in to their
demands.

1658
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:34,160
We're trying to buy some more time.

1659
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,500
Come on, Colonel.

1660
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,500
Why don't you stop playing dumb?

1661
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:40,980
I'm sorry about Merrill, but I want the lies to end now.

1662
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,360
What are you talking about?

1663
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:46,160
Metal Gear was designed to launch a new type of nuclear
warhead, wasn't it?

1664
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:48,280
Oh, no.

1665
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:49,920
You knew it all along, didn't you?

1666
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:50,400
No.

1667
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:53,440
Why did you try to hide it?

1668
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:54,180
Colonel!

1669
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:55,080
I'm sorry.

1670
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:57,540
Can't tell the grunts, huh?

1671
01:48:58,180 --> 01:48:59,660
You've changed a lot.

1672
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:03,860
Metal Gear, secret advanced nuclear weapons research.

1673
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:05,900
Does the White House know about this?

1674
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:06,840
Of course it does.

1675
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:08,040
Of course they did.

1676
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:16,000
do as far as i know as of yesterday the president had not
been briefed about the rex lies need to know basis is that

1677
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:25,560
the idea these are sensitive times even sub-critical nuclear
tests are causing quite a stir plausible deniability huh yes

1678
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:33,540
and tomorrow the president and his russian counterpart are
scheduled to sign the start three accord i get it that's the

1679
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:40,820
reason for the deadline that's right snake and that's why we
can't let this attack go public we still haven't even

1680
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:51,900
ratified start to or dealt with the issue of TMDs this is
ridiculous I don't care about the president's reputation I

1681
01:49:51,900 --> 01:50:03,440
don't care convenient I don't care just stop them to serve
your interests because we're relying on you in that case I

1682
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:10,500
like this picture cuz snake looks so mad I told you I don't
know the details.

1683
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:12,020
I don't believe you.

1684
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:14,160
Yeah, I don't believe you either, Colonel.

1685
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:18,140
If the situation is so serious, why don't you give in to
their demands?

1686
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:20,140
Let them have big bosses remains.

1687
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:20,700
Yeah, who cares?

1688
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:23,700
You see, or is there some reason that you can't do that?

1689
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,720
Something you haven't told me about.

1690
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:30,160
The president has adopted a firm public stance vis-a-vis
bioethics.

1691
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:34,060
We don't want the existence of the Genome Army to go public.

1692
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:37,440
You're just all covering your butts.

1693
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:47,240
for your mistake yeah the hell with you i'm sorry the corpse
of the darpa chief is lying right here next to me poor man

1694
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:57,520
but it's strange he looks and smells like he's been dead for
days all his blood's been drained out too drained maybe to

1695
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:05,260
slow down decomposition i have no idea but the chief only
died a few hours ago right right but he's already started to

1696
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:13,900
decompose something in his blood that they wanted i doubt it
just the nano machines in the transmitter did the chief tell

1697
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:20,560
them his detonation code i'm afraid so yeah it looks like
they've got both codes and are nearly ready to launch oh my

1698
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:27,200
gosh we gotta stop that launch is there any way to prevent
it it seems there's some type of emergency override device

1699
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:33,540
that can cancel out the detonation code it's a counter
measure that arms tech installed secretly you have to unlock

1700
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:39,100
it with three special card keys we only have one and where
are those keys you only have the one one of them yeah i

1701
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:47,200
don't know where the other two are besides i'm locked up
here we've got no choice forget about the keys your top

1702
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:55,240
priority now is to destroy metal gear itself i'm sorry to
have to lay it all in your lap but you're all i've got bust

1703
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:59,520
out of there and get to the communications Well, I'm busting
alright.

1704
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:02,740
Merrill, right?

1705
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:03,680
Yeah.

1706
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:06,420
I'll save her.

1707

Thanks.

1708
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:08,140
I won't.

Do that.

1710
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:12,480
I won't do that.

1711
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:17,660
I won't do that.

1712
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:18,220
Huh?

1713
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:19,460

That witch.

1717

She took my clothes.

1718
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:26,400
That witch.

inner ear.

Why don't you contact the Colonel?

1752
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:50,700
If anyone can think of a way out, it's him.

1753
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,020

Serial number and date of birth.

1764
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:22,740
But you're not any old soldier, Snake.

1765
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:23,080
I'm not.

1766
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:23,880
I'm a gamer.

1767
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:25,440

1768
01:54:25,660 --> 01:54:25,820

01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,160

This guy has no hygiene.

1777
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:10,720
Oh, my God.

01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:12,740

Can you imagine?

1796
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:48,780
Tascaru sneezed Johnny 11 years just good.

01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:53,280
Okay, I'll tell you once more.

1803
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:33,540
I'm not like one of those KGB slugs.

1804
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:34,300
Shalashaska.

1805
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:35,560
To me, this isn't torture.

1806
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:37,340
It's a sport.

1807
01:56:37,580 --> 01:56:38,360
It's a fetish.

1808
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:41,320
You're all just a bunch of sadists.

1809
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:42,840
Yeah, he is.

1810
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:46,040
Don't confuse me with those uniformed fools.

1811
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:48,720
Shalashaska.

1812
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,700
Look at his nipples are kind of long, though, right?

1813
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:52,280
Shall we begin?

1814
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:55,220
Okay, I have to submit though, don't I?

1815
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,340
Do we want to go through one more time?

1816
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:03,160
What should I do?

1817
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:06,840
Oh my gosh, it's so easy.

1818
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:08,500
How did you like that?

1819
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:08,980
Submit.

1820
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,900
You can go through two sessions.

1821
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:21,800
No, guys, you're really gonna want to see the Otacon ending,
I promise.

1822
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:24,180
Okay.

1823
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:26,800
There's three sessions to it.

1824
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:34,260
I just kind of want to like...

1825
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:35,820
I kind of want to just like...

1826
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:39,860
Hang out with Johnny one more time.

1827
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:42,820
You're a strong man.

1828
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:43,760
I am.

1829
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:46,200
Well, that's enough for now, I think.

1830
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:46,980
For now.

1831
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:50,820
I feel like a loser submitting, even though it's...

1832
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:52,360
You know?

1833
01:57:53,820 --> 01:57:56,660
I feel like a loser if I submit...

1834
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:58,260
Did you save?

1835
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:58,940
I did save, yep.

1836
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:03,360
20th century Russia has had its share of problems, but at
least they had an ideology.

1837
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:06,080
Russia today has nothing.

1838
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:07,140
Yon, I'm sleepy.

1839
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:13,480
They're struggling between freedom and order, and with that
struggle, a new spirit of nationalism has been born.

1840
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:17,800
The boss has a close friend high up in the Russian
government.

1841
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:20,720
He's currently the head of Spetsnaz.

1842
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:22,720
Spetsnaz.

1843
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,600
He's agreed to purchase this new nuclear weapons system.

1844
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:36,160
was just a down payment oh this is uh you're in this for the
money oh no i don't need money oh no i want russia to be

1847
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:01,700
He loves to watch me get dragged away.

1848
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:03,280
I'm back.

1849
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:05,760
I'm back, my girlfriend.

1850
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:08,520
What if I hide under here?

1851
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:10,200

Oh.

1855
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:13,260
Who's calling me?

1856
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:14,660
You okay, Snake?

1857
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:15,780
I'm good.

1858
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:17,800
Nothing new to report.

1859
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:19,120
Snake.

1860
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:20,140
Oh, my God.

1861
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:20,880
Raffle Chief!

1862
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:22,180
Thank you for the 50 gift!

1863
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:22,900
Thank you!

1864
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:25,300
Oh, I guess I should have...

1865
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:26,780
I increased the level of pain.

1866
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:27,920
To the Raiders.

1867
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,340
Hi, I'm Mint Phantom.

1868
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:30,920
I'm a ghost maid.

1869
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:33,940
Say something to take my mind off the pain.

1870
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:34,340
Ooh.

1871
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:35,580
What can I say?

1872
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:36,640
I love Metal Gear Solid.

1873
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:36,980
Anything.

1874
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:37,620
Too much.

1875
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:40,880
I... I'm not a very good talker.

1876
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:41,620
Please.

1877
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:43,820
Tell me about yourself.

1878
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:45,880
Myself.

1879
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:47,480
That's a tough one.

1880
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:48,560
Any family?

1881
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:50,900
That's not a happy topic for me.

1882
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:53,260
I don't have any family.

1883
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:54,820
No, wait.

1884
01:59:55,540 --> 01:59:56,800
There was a man who...

1885
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:58,020
Who said he was my father.

1886
01:59:59,060 --> 01:59:59,600
Where is he?

1887
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:00,640
Dead.

1888
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:02,600
By my own hand.

1889
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:04,080
Big Boss.

1890
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:05,240
What?

1891
02:00:06,180 --> 02:00:07,000
Big Boss?

1892
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:09,160
There was no way you could know.

1893
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,240
It happened in Zanzibar land six years ago.

1894
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:15,900
Only Snake and I know the real truth of what happened there.

1895
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:17,840
So, is it true?

1896
02:00:18,940 --> 02:00:20,740
Was Big Boss really your father?

1897
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:22,520
That's what he said.

1898
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:24,400
That's all I know.

1899
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:26,260
And you were able to kill him.

1900
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:27,740
Knowing that?

1901
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:29,840
How?

1902
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:31,400
It's what we wanted.

1903
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:32,520
Me.

1904
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:34,320
And him.

1905
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:35,880
That's patricide.

1906
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:36,380
Yeah.

1907
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:37,300
After Zanzibar.

1908
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:39,800
That's the trauma of my life.

1909
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:42,120
Just like Mantis said.

1910
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:42,700
Aw, Snake.

1911
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:44,040
Is that why you left Foxhound?

1912
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:47,400
Let's just say that I needed to be alone for a while.

1913
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:49,620
And Alaska was the perfect place.

1914
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:50,880
And you're 50 dogs.

1915
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:51,800
Snake.

1916
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,100
Yeah, I'm troubled too, Naomi.

1917
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:55,100
I didn't have a real family either.

1918
02:00:55,180 --> 02:00:56,380
We all have our problems, Naomi.

1919
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:58,160
brother who put me through school.

1920
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:01,460
We weren't even blood related and he was much older than me.

1921
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:02,260
Thank you, Mindy, for fixing the soundtrack.

1922
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:03,020
I got you.

1923
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:04,540
He's dead.

1924
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:05,940
I'm sorry.

1925
02:01:06,820 --> 02:01:09,160
His name was Frank Hunter.

1926
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:10,060
Is there a woman in your life?

1927
02:01:10,140 --> 02:01:15,380
I'm sorry, Frankie after you've been through as many wars as
me, it's hard to trust anyone.

1928
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:16,500
Friends.

1929
02:01:17,220 --> 02:01:18,000
Roy Campbell.

1930
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:21,400
You're still calling me friends.

1931
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:22,900
Is that it?

1932
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:26,400
Sorry, I love that part because Campbell's actually so cute
there.

1933
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:36,440
Jager big boss is most trusted lieutenant and the only
member of Foxhound ever to receive the code name Fox gray

1934
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:50,440
Fox I learned a lot from him but didn't you try to kill each
other it's true we did in Zanzibar land but it was nothing

1935
02:01:50,440 --> 02:02:00,160
personal we were just professionals on opposite sides that's
all and you still hard to believe war is no reason to end a

1936
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:09,100
friendship that's insane i first met him on the battlefield
he was being held a prisoner of outer heaven but he didn't

1937
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:17,780
look like a prisoner to me he was always so cool and precise
he's so cool i was still green and he showed me the ropes

1938
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:26,620
you knew him well yeah we had like two lines together in the
first game sort of an unwritten rule the next time i saw him

1939
02:02:26,620 --> 02:02:27,220
on the battlefield.

1940
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:29,280
We were enemies.

1941
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:32,240
We were fighting bare-handed in a minefield.

1942
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:33,540
Yeah, it was so awesome.

1943
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:34,060
I punched him.

1944
02:02:34,060 --> 02:02:38,440
I know it sounds strange to most people, but we were just
two soldiers doing our jobs.

1945
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:40,100
It's like a sport.

1946
02:02:40,220 --> 02:02:41,120
Thought there was an actual BGM.

1947
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:42,100
No, it's just me.

1948
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:44,860
Just violence, murdering each other.

1949
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:45,440
Yeah.

1950
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:46,820
It's just me.

1951
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:47,680
I think so, too.

1952
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:52,340
So if you were friends, then how do you explain the ninja's
behavior?

1953
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,300
I don't know.

1954
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:54,240
I thought it was in-game BGM.

1955
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,180
I don't even know how to sing the song.

1956
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:04,160
Naomi, why did you get into genetic research anyway?

1957
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:05,540
Yeah, why did you?

1958
02:03:05,860 --> 02:03:07,800
I never knew who my parents were.

1959
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:10,180
Or even what they looked like.

1960
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:11,320
This is the truth.

1961
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:15,060
I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out
why I am the way I am.

1962
02:03:15,140 --> 02:03:15,780
This is the truth.

1963
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:17,420
So you studied about DNA.

1964
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:22,300
I thought if I could thoroughly understand DNA, I could get
back my identity.

1965
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:26,780
I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic
information...

1966
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:33,720
made the cutscene better oh i'll keep going blank spots in
that person's memory memory is stored in dna we're not sure

1967
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:41,400
but we know that a person's genetic fate is determined just
by the sequence of the four bases in their dna so what about

1968
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:53,140
my fate you know my dna sequence don't you your fate i'm i'm
sorry i have no idea of course not you're a scientist not a

1969
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:54,160
fortune teller

1970
02:04:00,010 --> 02:04:03,610
See, part of me is also like, I want to see these...

1971
02:04:03,610 --> 02:04:04,010
Oh!

1972
02:04:05,230 --> 02:04:05,330
Oh!

1973
02:04:06,410 --> 02:04:07,610
My stomach!

1974
02:04:08,150 --> 02:04:08,750
IBS?

1975
02:04:10,050 --> 02:04:11,070
IBS real?

1976
02:04:12,110 --> 02:04:12,830
Go Johnny!

1977
02:04:16,190 --> 02:04:17,030
Go, Johnny!

1978
02:04:18,970 --> 02:04:19,510
Go, Johnny!

1979
02:04:24,770 --> 02:04:25,670
You okay in there?

1980
02:04:27,970 --> 02:04:31,070
If only we had the mic, the direction, oh.

1981
02:04:32,850 --> 02:04:34,430
Oh my god, that's scary.

1982
02:04:34,650 --> 02:04:36,890
Oh my god, why does he walk like Sasquatch?

1983
02:04:37,330 --> 02:04:38,270
Otakon, please!

1984
02:04:38,570 --> 02:04:39,770
Hey, I'm here.

1985
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:40,410

02:04:48,010 --> 02:04:48,790
It's me.

1987
02:04:49,450 --> 02:04:50,270
It's Otakon.

1988
02:04:51,670 --> 02:04:52,150
Wow.

1989
02:04:52,910 --> 02:04:54,150
They even captured you.

1990
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:55,710
Oh, I thought he was saying wow.

1991
02:04:56,070 --> 02:04:56,390
Oh my god.

1992
02:04:57,090 --> 02:04:57,730
Oh my god.

1993
02:04:57,770 --> 02:05:00,410
Stop being a high school bully again.

1994
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:03,450
Don't be mean to him.

1995
02:05:03,550 --> 02:05:04,170
Oh my god.

1996
02:05:04,590 --> 02:05:05,010

next to him.

2000
02:05:44,210 --> 02:05:46,050
King Cube Snake has anger issues.

2001
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:46,750
It's true.

2002
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:48,930
He's such a high school bully to poor Otacon.

2003
02:05:53,830 --> 02:05:55,230
That's... That's a ration.

2004
02:05:56,270 --> 02:05:57,590
So what are you doing here then?

Hey!

2045
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:49,990
He fell asleep.

2046
02:08:50,990 --> 02:08:53,950
They're giving me every opportunity to use this ketchup.

2047
02:08:54,350 --> 02:08:57,830
They're like, hey, you want to use it?

2048
02:08:59,730 --> 02:09:00,810
Oh, oh.

2049
02:09:01,330 --> 02:09:01,970
Shoot.

2050
02:09:02,690 --> 02:09:04,570
That coma doesn't knock me out.

2051
02:09:05,950 --> 02:09:07,150
It doesn't even work.

2052
02:09:07,390 --> 02:09:08,570
It doesn't even work.

2053
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:10,550
I'm so sleepy.

2054
02:09:11,630 --> 02:09:12,970
Maybe if I walk a little.

2055
02:09:13,450 --> 02:09:14,030
Yeah, walk around.

2056
02:09:14,270 --> 02:09:14,770
Walk it off, buddy.

2057
02:09:15,010 --> 02:09:15,390
Walk it off.

2058
02:09:18,310 --> 02:09:21,790
The funny part, too, is like, it looks like Johnny.

2059
02:09:22,490 --> 02:09:25,190
Like, I can see Johnny with those eyes, you know?

2060
02:09:26,830 --> 02:09:28,410
Like, that looks like Johnny to me.

2061
02:09:29,490 --> 02:09:30,070
Come here, come here.

2062
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:31,470
Come here, Johnny.

2063
02:09:31,850 --> 02:09:32,190
Yeah, yeah.

2064
02:09:32,490 --> 02:09:32,890
Look at me.

2065
02:09:33,250 --> 02:09:33,710
I don't know.

2066
02:09:33,790 --> 02:09:34,690
It just looks like him.

2067
02:09:36,490 --> 02:09:37,170
Bless you!

2068
02:09:39,070 --> 02:09:40,270
Shut up in there, will ya?

2069
02:09:40,610 --> 02:09:41,090
I won't.

2070
02:09:41,190 --> 02:09:41,510
I won't.

2071
02:09:41,630 --> 02:09:42,830
I won't be silenced.

2072
02:09:43,410 --> 02:09:44,330
I won't be silenced.

2073
02:09:45,170 --> 02:09:46,570
You can't stop me.

2074
02:09:46,810 --> 02:09:47,290
What are you going to do?

2075
02:09:47,330 --> 02:09:48,230
Come in here.

2076
02:09:48,890 --> 02:09:49,370
Oh.

2077
02:09:49,470 --> 02:09:50,390
Shut up in there, will you?

2078
02:09:52,010 --> 02:09:52,830
All right, guys.

2079
02:09:53,370 --> 02:09:55,230
Snake, it's showtime.

2080
02:09:55,290 --> 02:09:56,930
It's time to submit.

2081
02:09:59,270 --> 02:10:02,550
It's time to submit like the little baby that I am.

2082
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:04,390
Remember to give up.

2083
02:10:04,530 --> 02:10:06,610
I know it's really hard not to sometimes.

2084
02:10:07,530 --> 02:10:09,630
But also, I wanted to see the cutscenes too, so.

2085
02:10:10,710 --> 02:10:11,610
Seeing the...

2086
02:10:11,630 --> 02:10:13,010
I'll tell you one thing.

2087
02:10:13,390 --> 02:10:14,130
The Ocelot one was fine.

2088
02:10:15,370 --> 02:10:18,750
Press the resist button repeatedly to regain your strength.

2089
02:10:20,070 --> 02:10:23,310
When you've had enough, press the surrender button to
submit.

2090
02:10:23,670 --> 02:10:24,650
Submit to you, Ocelot.

2091
02:10:24,670 --> 02:10:27,370
When your life reaches zero, the game is over.

2092
02:10:29,330 --> 02:10:31,150
There are no continues, my friend.

2093
02:10:31,150 --> 02:10:32,230
Patrez, welcome to membership.

2094
02:10:32,410 --> 02:10:32,770
Thank you.

2095
02:10:35,610 --> 02:10:37,610
Okay, let's get started.

2096
02:10:37,930 --> 02:10:39,770
So submissive and torturable.

2097
02:10:43,070 --> 02:10:45,630
Okay, so it's start and A.

2098
02:10:48,150 --> 02:10:49,310
Go submit!

2099
02:10:50,050 --> 02:10:51,430
Mission to the Ten Gifted!

2100
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:52,430
What do you mean submit?

2101
02:10:52,730 --> 02:10:53,410
Oh, Meryl?

2102
02:10:53,830 --> 02:10:54,410
Um, don't look.

2103
02:10:54,750 --> 02:10:55,030
Meryl?

2104
02:10:56,210 --> 02:10:57,850
Meryl, shield your eyes.

2105
02:10:58,370 --> 02:10:58,690
Forever.

2106
02:10:59,990 --> 02:11:00,750
Had enough?

2107
02:11:01,490 --> 02:11:03,450
So you're human after all.

2108
02:11:03,470 --> 02:11:04,710
It does feel wrong, doesn't it?

2109
02:11:04,850 --> 02:11:05,450
It does feel wrong.

2110
02:11:05,450 --> 02:11:07,050
The torture will stop as I promised.

2111
02:11:07,910 --> 02:11:09,990

02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:48,180
Man, you can't do that.

2117
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:49,320
The future will be changed.

2118
02:11:49,940 --> 02:11:51,540
You created a time paradox.

2119
02:11:53,540 --> 02:11:54,420
It's okay.

2120
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:58,100
That's why this is not the canon game, right?

2121
02:12:02,580 --> 02:12:03,780
Bless you.

2122
02:12:07,150 --> 02:12:08,170
Here it comes.

2123
02:12:08,750 --> 02:12:09,630
Oh, not again.

2124
02:12:09,970 --> 02:12:10,690
Oh, not again.

2125
02:12:12,490 --> 02:12:18,090
Oh, that sounds like you relieved yourself, Mr. That didn't
sound like...

2126
02:12:18,670 --> 02:12:19,530
There he goes.

2127
02:12:21,050 --> 02:12:21,590
That's me.

2128
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:23,130
That's gonna be me in a few minutes.

2129
02:12:29,310 --> 02:12:29,670
Um...

2130
02:12:29,670 --> 02:12:30,130
Oh!

2131
02:12:31,730 --> 02:12:33,050
I pulled an Otacon.

2132
02:12:37,550 --> 02:12:38,230
That's better.

2133
02:12:40,410 --> 02:12:41,170
Okay, oh wait.

2134
02:12:41,310 --> 02:12:41,670
No, no, no.

2135
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:41,970
Lay down.

2136
02:12:42,070 --> 02:12:42,570
Lay down, Snake.

2137
02:12:42,990 --> 02:12:43,430
There we go.

2138
02:12:43,570 --> 02:12:43,710
Okay.

2139
02:12:44,050 --> 02:12:44,550
I'm dead.

2140
02:12:47,130 --> 02:12:47,630
I'm dead.

2141
02:12:47,770 --> 02:12:47,890
I'm dead.

2142
02:12:48,290 --> 02:12:48,630
I'm dead.

2143
02:12:49,070 --> 02:12:49,210
I'm dead.

2144
02:12:52,450 --> 02:12:53,750
What the hell?

2145
02:13:23,970 --> 02:13:24,590
My stuff?

2146
02:13:25,150 --> 02:13:25,550
My stuff.

2147
02:13:27,930 --> 02:13:28,450
Yippee!

2148
02:13:32,350 --> 02:13:32,870
Call?

2149
02:13:33,530 --> 02:13:34,430
What should I call?

2150
02:13:35,190 --> 02:13:35,850
Call Campbell?

2151
02:13:36,950 --> 02:13:39,590
To get to the underground base where Metal Gear is.

2152
02:13:39,730 --> 02:13:39,910
Yes.

2153
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:43,410
You'll have to climb the communications tower on the north
side of the cave.

2154
02:13:43,670 --> 02:13:43,970
Okay.

2155
02:13:45,370 --> 02:13:45,650
Um.

2156
02:13:46,690 --> 02:13:47,430
Monster Miller.

2157
02:13:47,810 --> 02:13:48,310
I'm alive.

2158
02:13:48,550 --> 02:13:48,890
I'm good.

2159
02:13:49,110 --> 02:13:52,670
Now that you've got your stuff back, You should take a good
look through it.

2160
02:13:53,110 --> 02:13:58,350
If you're slow equipping an item in battle, it could mean
death Right, I go.

2161
02:13:58,590 --> 02:14:04,490

Anastasia, do you know anything about the bomb that's in my
inventory or?

2164
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Snake Hurry up to the communications tower.

2165
02:14:28,660 --> 02:14:29,400
I guess not.

2166
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:31,480
Unless she doesn't know anything.

2167
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:34,800
You called, Snake?

2168
02:14:35,420 --> 02:14:35,780
Yeah.

2169
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:37,760
She's gonna save.

2170
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:38,780
Bomb!

2171
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:40,120
Whoa!

2172
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:41,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2173
02:14:42,220 --> 02:14:47,100
I have to go to the bathroom so bad, but I'm waiting to...

2174
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:48,840
Good luck, Snake.

2175
02:14:49,180 --> 02:14:49,840
Thank you!

2176
02:14:50,620 --> 02:14:51,380
Um, okay.

2177
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:53,760
Start A button to exit.

2178
02:14:54,540 --> 02:14:55,620
And, um...

2179
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:57,540
Where is that?

2180
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:00,360
Not the book.

2181
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:02,840
Is it...

2182
02:15:02,840 --> 02:15:03,860
Is it in... wait.

2183
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:04,800
Is it in here?

2184
02:15:05,780 --> 02:15:06,220
No.

2185
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:08,820
Where is it?

2186
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:14,200
Remindy.

2187
02:15:14,540 --> 02:15:15,260
Palky.

2188
02:15:19,060 --> 02:15:19,260
Huh?

2189
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:20,920
Wait!

2190
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:23,620
Oh, there's no bomb if you surrender?

2191
02:15:25,340 --> 02:15:26,060
Really?

2192
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:27,260
Really?

2193
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:29,460
That's funny.

2194
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:32,200
Hold on, I wanna, um...

2195
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:33,460
I wanna shoot him.

2196
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:34,280
Not dead.

2197
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:36,940
He's got a whole life to live.

2198
02:15:41,180 --> 02:15:43,980
But you know, I wanna make sure he's, like, actually knocked
out.

2199
02:15:44,220 --> 02:15:45,980
Oh, I guess he's not gonna wake up.

2200
02:15:46,540 --> 02:15:46,760
Okay.

2201
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:49,140
Really?

2202
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:51,780
There's no bomb if you...

2203
02:15:52,820 --> 02:15:53,300
Huh.

2204
02:15:53,820 --> 02:15:55,180
Good to know, I guess.

2205
02:15:56,480 --> 02:15:56,960
Pew, pew!

2206
02:15:57,400 --> 02:15:57,620
Wait!

2207
02:15:58,500 --> 02:15:59,480
I'll take it.

2208
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:01,340
Why does this always happen to me?

2209
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:03,600
Oh, man.

2210
02:16:04,360 --> 02:16:04,620
Okay.

2211
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:09,160
Johnny without Merrill's kind of a sad future.

2212
02:16:10,600 --> 02:16:11,960
Nah, he'll be fine.

2213
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,040
He'll be fine.

2214
02:16:14,600 --> 02:16:18,040
He'll find someone else who will love his...

2215
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:21,260
Who will love him for how he...

2216
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:23,360
Yeah, I don't think it's a good idea to go in there.

2217
02:16:23,460 --> 02:16:24,560
I think it's, like, really gross.

2218
02:16:35,710 --> 02:16:38,490
Who just... who just sneezed?

2219
02:16:40,710 --> 02:16:41,310
Oh, me?

2220
02:16:42,050 --> 02:16:43,130
I sneezed?

2221
02:16:46,130 --> 02:16:47,350
That's so cute.

2222
02:16:49,290 --> 02:16:50,070
Bless you, me.

2223
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:52,130
It was me, sorry.

2224
02:16:55,570 --> 02:16:57,070
It's not gonna see me, right?

2225
02:17:06,710 --> 02:17:07,850
Oh, what's this?

2226
02:17:08,210 --> 02:17:08,970
Oh, that's an elevator?

2227
02:17:10,930 --> 02:17:13,370
Oh, yes, this is where we're at.

2228
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:16,490
See, remember, like, this part is kind of, like, a blur to
me.

2229
02:17:16,850 --> 02:17:19,010
So, oh, we're back in here.

2230
02:17:19,390 --> 02:17:20,330
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2231
02:17:21,510 --> 02:17:24,070
So now, wait, Colonel, where do I go again?

2232
02:17:24,210 --> 02:17:24,770
I'm so sorry.

2233
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:26,710
Cushami, tascaru.

2234
02:17:28,270 --> 02:17:28,610
Action!

2235
02:17:31,230 --> 02:17:33,490
Snake, Naomi wants to talk to you.

2236
02:17:33,570 --> 02:17:34,290
Um, why?

2237
02:17:34,390 --> 02:17:35,250
How do you feel, Snake?

2238
02:17:35,590 --> 02:17:36,170
I feel fine.

2239
02:17:36,430 --> 02:17:38,890
To tell you the truth, I think I'm catching a call.

2240
02:17:38,930 --> 02:17:39,990
I think I'm catching a call.

2241
02:17:40,430 --> 02:17:42,130
I'm monitoring you via the nanomachines.

2242
02:17:42,530 --> 02:17:42,990
You're so cute.

2243
02:17:43,230 --> 02:17:46,330
Your body temperature is elevated and your lymph nodes are
slightly swollen.

2244
02:17:46,910 --> 02:17:47,430
But don't worry.

2245
02:17:47,830 --> 02:17:49,910
It appears to be just a mild rhino virus.

2246
02:17:50,350 --> 02:17:52,030
I guess I got it from that soldier.

2247
02:17:52,470 --> 02:17:55,050
I've increased your nutrition and elevated your blood sugar
level.

2248
02:17:55,550 --> 02:17:56,510
You can't cure it.

2249
02:17:56,710 --> 02:17:57,230
Sorry, Snake.

2250
02:17:57,690 --> 02:17:59,430
The nanomachines don't carry antibiotics.

2251
02:18:00,570 --> 02:18:01,570
Maybe you could find some garlic.

2252
02:18:02,150 --> 02:18:03,870
It contains natural antibiotics, you know.

2253
02:18:04,290 --> 02:18:05,310
I'm a garlic girl.

2254
02:18:05,890 --> 02:18:07,590
Ugh, brown garlic.

2255
02:18:08,110 --> 02:18:08,950
Give me a break.

2256
02:18:09,130 --> 02:18:09,950
Give me a break.

2257
02:18:10,430 --> 02:18:11,830
Your dad would have said delicious.

2258
02:18:11,850 --> 02:18:13,810
There must be some cold medicine somewhere on the base.

2259
02:18:14,390 --> 02:18:15,650
That would make you feel better.

2260
02:18:16,450 --> 02:18:20,070
If not, you'll just have to wait until your body's natural
defenses take over.

2261
02:18:20,330 --> 02:18:20,930
I'm sorry.

2262
02:18:21,330 --> 02:18:22,430
The nanomachines?

2263
02:18:23,630 --> 02:18:27,330
The nanomachines can't cure a common cold.

2264
02:18:29,450 --> 02:18:34,430
But with what we know about nanomachines...

2265
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:39,880
I'm sorry, they had...

2266
02:18:39,880 --> 02:18:40,640
I'm sorry.

2267
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:42,940
Huh?

2268
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:44,840
They cannot cure a common cold?

2269
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:50,960
And yet, and yet, early nanomachines, son.

2270
02:18:52,020 --> 02:18:54,220
I actually, I'm going to go to the bathroom real quick.

2271
02:18:54,840 --> 02:18:55,920
I'm going to go potty.

2272
02:18:57,440 --> 02:18:59,460
And, you know, don't clip that.

2273
02:19:00,540 --> 02:19:01,520
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

2274
02:19:01,660 --> 02:19:04,060
I'm going to go to the little ghosty girl room.

2275
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:06,680
So, I will be right back.

2276
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:08,360
Actually, I'm going to rewrite this.

2277
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:10,660
Bathroom break.

2278
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:15,680
And I will be right back.

2279
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:18,520
I will be right back.

2280
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:20,840
BRB.

2281
02:21:52,030 --> 02:21:53,750
La la la la la.

2282
02:21:54,070 --> 02:21:54,410
I hope.

2283
02:21:54,990 --> 02:21:57,290
I hope that everyone has been good.

2284
02:21:57,590 --> 02:22:03,450
I hope that people haven't been sending wasteful donos.

2285
02:22:15,150 --> 02:22:16,990
But she forgot to wash her hands.

2286
02:22:17,290 --> 02:22:18,470
I never forget.

2287
02:22:19,390 --> 02:22:20,870
Ever, ever, ever, ever.

2288
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:21,930
ever forget.

2289
02:22:24,590 --> 02:22:26,530
Give me one second, though.

2290
02:22:28,390 --> 02:22:28,750
Um.

2291
02:22:32,020 --> 02:22:32,460
Hmm.

2292
02:22:35,380 --> 02:22:35,980
Okay.

2293
02:22:37,880 --> 02:22:38,420
Okay.

2294
02:22:39,020 --> 02:22:39,900
Now we're good.

2295
02:22:40,820 --> 02:22:41,260
Okie dokie.

2296
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:42,780
I sent you a pizza.

2297
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:44,380
Thanks!

2298
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:46,920
I was just thinking how I was trying to get hungry.

2299
02:22:48,700 --> 02:22:49,040
Alrighty.

2300
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:53,260
Uh, Colonel, where's the communication tower?

2301
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:57,300
Colonel, where's the tower?

2302
02:22:57,900 --> 02:22:58,400
I don't remember.

2303
02:22:59,180 --> 02:22:59,660
Where do I go?

2304
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:05,020
There must be some cold medicine somewhere on the base.

2305
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:06,740
That would make you feel better.

2306
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:08,360
Yeah, it would, but like...

2307
02:23:08,360 --> 02:23:11,240
You'll just have to wait until your body's natural defenses
take over.

2308
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:12,000
Sorry, guys.

2309
02:23:13,100 --> 02:23:13,980
Thank you.

2310
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:15,680
So sorry.

2311
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:18,440
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2312
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:21,760
Okay, okay.

2313
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:22,260
Okay, okay.

2314
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:40,220

02:23:53,570 --> 02:23:56,590
my health is good My rations are full.

2317
02:23:58,370 --> 02:23:59,290
I'm a healthy guy.

2318
02:23:59,490 --> 02:24:00,630
How do I get to the communication?

2319
02:24:00,890 --> 02:24:01,650
Where do I go?

2320
02:24:02,150 --> 02:24:07,470
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one.

2321
02:24:08,290 --> 02:24:09,050
Oh, bless you.

2322
02:24:10,170 --> 02:24:11,910
Wait, do you think they have some in here?

2323
02:24:12,710 --> 02:24:13,490
Any cold medicine?

2324
02:24:14,030 --> 02:24:15,150
It's the medical room.

2325
02:24:15,750 --> 02:24:17,210
It has to be...

2326
02:24:19,470 --> 02:24:20,670
Is Johnny gone?

2327
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:23,490
Watch, it's probably like...

2328
02:24:26,410 --> 02:24:27,490
In the...

2329
02:24:28,890 --> 02:24:29,610
Oh.

2330
02:24:32,110 --> 02:24:34,790
It's probably in the locker that I couldn't get into.

2331
02:24:41,470 --> 02:24:42,730
It's probably in here.

2332
02:24:47,370 --> 02:24:48,090
Um...

2333
02:24:48,090 --> 02:24:48,950
Oh, shoot.

2334
02:24:50,170 --> 02:24:51,270
One dollar.

2335
02:24:52,790 --> 02:24:53,950
Oh, ew!

2336
02:24:54,810 --> 02:24:56,810
Oh my god, that's nasty!

2337
02:24:58,210 --> 02:24:58,890
Snake!

2338
02:25:05,890 --> 02:25:09,290
I think there's probably one in here but I can't get to it.

2339
02:25:09,430 --> 02:25:10,550
What should I do?

2340
02:25:11,230 --> 02:25:12,470
What should I do?

2341
02:25:14,390 --> 02:25:16,050
Seems pretty economic to me.

2342
02:25:16,370 --> 02:25:17,450
It's going to a good cause.

2343
02:25:17,690 --> 02:25:18,130
Is it?

2344
02:25:18,990 --> 02:25:19,510
Is it?

2345
02:25:19,690 --> 02:25:20,570
He's cold.

2346
02:25:21,430 --> 02:25:23,470
If you're cold, he's cold.

2347
02:25:23,990 --> 02:25:25,010
Let him in.

2348
02:25:27,030 --> 02:25:27,850
Oh gosh.

2349
02:25:29,650 --> 02:25:29,950
Yeah.

2350
02:25:30,650 --> 02:25:31,190
Yeah.

2351
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:35,740
There's something else here, right?

2352
02:25:36,400 --> 02:25:36,660
No.

2353
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:41,040
This is the medical room, and they don't have anything?

2354
02:25:41,560 --> 02:25:42,920
Medical room, my butt.

2355
02:25:44,140 --> 02:25:44,780
Oh, bless you.

2356
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:47,620
He's so cute.

2357
02:25:47,820 --> 02:25:48,760
The little sneezes.

2358
02:25:49,780 --> 02:25:53,780
You have such a bad constitution, Snake, if you got sick
that quickly.

2359
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:56,180
You ran into him one time.

2360
02:25:57,500 --> 02:25:58,780
Rations aren't garlic?

2361
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:01,120
I don't know, actually.

2362
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:03,280
Okay.

2363
02:26:09,380 --> 02:26:12,620
Oh, in the vent!

2364
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:13,840
Oh, so true, so true.

2365
02:26:14,780 --> 02:26:15,540
The vent over here?

2366
02:26:25,570 --> 02:26:26,650
There's Russians.

2367
02:26:27,550 --> 02:26:29,210
There might be medicine down here.

2368
02:26:30,050 --> 02:26:31,590
I feel...

2369
02:26:31,590 --> 02:26:33,890
I feel like I had some medicine.

2370
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:36,390
I feel like I at least saw some medicine.

2371
02:26:36,630 --> 02:26:36,930
Something.

2372
02:26:40,430 --> 02:26:42,710
Johnny was carrying sneeze, die.

2373
02:26:43,950 --> 02:26:44,510
Okay.

2374
02:26:45,890 --> 02:26:47,770
There's medicine in Psycho Mantis's area.

2375
02:26:47,910 --> 02:26:48,630
You have to go there anyway.

2376
02:26:49,230 --> 02:26:50,230
Oh, oh, you know what?

2377
02:26:50,510 --> 02:26:51,210
You're so right.

2378
02:26:51,550 --> 02:26:53,550
Because you're right, you're right, you're right.

2379
02:26:54,010 --> 02:26:57,610
Because that's how we were going to the communications tower
and that's when we get stopped.

2380
02:26:58,330 --> 02:27:00,390
Yes, it's all coming back to me.

2381
02:27:01,070 --> 02:27:03,170
Yes, sneaky, sneaky snake.

2382
02:27:05,530 --> 02:27:05,930
Oh,

2383
02:27:16,970 --> 02:27:19,090
I have to go all the way back to the third building.

2384
02:27:21,310 --> 02:27:21,710
Oh.

2385
02:27:32,210 --> 02:27:36,550
This game is the first game to ever start my MGS brain ride
as a kid.

2386
02:27:36,850 --> 02:27:40,370
Never did play the OG game until years later.

2387
02:27:43,050 --> 02:27:49,550
Even though this is so vastly different from the original
game, it is still a lot of fun.

2388
02:27:51,010 --> 02:27:54,750
It is still a great game to get your start on.

2389
02:27:56,070 --> 02:27:57,030
I believe.

2390
02:28:11,080 --> 02:28:12,860
Oh, that scared me.

2391
02:28:13,340 --> 02:28:14,360
That scared me more than anything.

2392
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:18,160
That scared me more than anything.

2393
02:28:27,950 --> 02:28:28,690
Nothing to report.

2394
02:28:30,370 --> 02:28:30,670
What?

2395
02:28:33,070 --> 02:28:35,250
It's no one, actually.

2396
02:28:37,230 --> 02:28:37,750
See ya.

2397
02:28:39,090 --> 02:28:40,890
It's no one, actually.

2398
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:45,290
Actually, how did he see me?

2399
02:28:47,390 --> 02:29:12,730
he see me how did he see me I'm actually you don't even know
why I'm stream sniping that guy is actually one 80 IQ okay

2400
02:29:12,730 --> 02:29:16,390
now we got to go through this nonsense again.

2401
02:29:19,550 --> 02:29:20,620
Oh, oh, I passed it.

2402
02:29:31,020 --> 02:29:32,820
Just fake a British accent and pretend you're liquid.

2403
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:36,740
The smartest thing would have been to bleach my hair?

2404
02:29:37,940 --> 02:29:38,220
And...

2405
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:39,320
Oh.

2406
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:40,060
Oh.

2407
02:29:40,600 --> 02:29:41,100
Robot?

2408
02:29:42,880 --> 02:29:43,820
Was that a robot?

2409
02:29:47,100 --> 02:29:50,280
Um, it would have been to bleach my hair and pretend to
actually be liquid.

2410
02:29:50,900 --> 02:30:03,760
you know kind of like using the Rykov mask I think I should
join the team I think I could have given them way better

2411
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:21,410
advice this poor guy's ankles okay let's see now this is the
tricky part because as soon as we take him down they're

2412
02:30:21,410 --> 02:30:30,830
going to be like huh something something something someone's
here uh where's your status report laddy dody do you know so

2413

freeze him i gotta be fast gotta be so fast i'm scared

2414
02:30:43,370 --> 02:30:49,050

guess then because otherwise he wouldn't have i don't know

2415
02:30:49,050 --> 02:30:53,030
his path at all the guy here let's check Let's check.

2416
02:30:53,790 --> 02:30:55,210
Let's see where he comes from.

2417
02:30:57,050 --> 02:30:57,350
Let's see.

2418
02:30:57,490 --> 02:30:58,070
Because there's a guy.

2419
02:30:59,390 --> 02:31:01,630
The guy saw me over there, you know?

2420
02:31:09,310 --> 02:31:13,370
I kind of want him to shake me down, or I kind of want to
shake him down and take his, uh, dog tags.

2421
02:31:14,130 --> 02:31:15,590
But I don't want to waste time.

2422
02:31:17,610 --> 02:31:18,810
Okay, hear the other walking.

2423
02:31:25,430 --> 02:31:27,150
Does it, does anyone ever show up?

2424
02:31:29,890 --> 02:31:31,110
He's sleeping.

2425
02:31:34,880 --> 02:31:37,260
Like, there was someone that came and caught me.

2426
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:38,760
How, though?

2427
02:31:42,820 --> 02:31:44,800
I don't understand where did they...

2428
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:46,060
Where did they come from?

2429
02:31:49,220 --> 02:31:50,980
I hope Snake doesn't sneeze.

2430
02:31:51,340 --> 02:31:52,080
He wouldn't.

2431
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:53,500
He's better now.

2432
02:31:54,340 --> 02:31:54,820
Right, Snake?

2433
02:31:56,940 --> 02:31:57,600
Yeah.

2434
02:31:58,460 --> 02:31:59,700
He's better now.

2435
02:32:01,180 --> 02:32:03,100
Probably the guy upstairs heard you.

2436
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:05,720
Oh, you think he came, like, running down?

2437
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:08,400
Mmm, maybe.

2438
02:32:09,480 --> 02:32:14,280
Okay, so I freeze him, I come out, I knock him out, and then
I get in the box.

2439
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:16,980
Or I get in the truck.

2440
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:17,780
In the box.

2441
02:32:18,220 --> 02:32:19,320
Okay, here we go.

2442
02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:21,440
Freeze.

2443
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:26,940
Freeze?

2444
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:29,440
Freeze.

2445
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:30,560
Freeze.

2446
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:32,000
Freeze.

2447
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:33,040
Freeze.

2448
02:32:34,420 --> 02:32:35,380
Uh, freeze.

2449
02:32:36,980 --> 02:32:37,260
Hmm.

2450
02:32:47,450 --> 02:32:48,010
Freeze.

2451
02:32:51,010 --> 02:32:52,670
I don't want to...

2452
02:32:52,670 --> 02:32:53,170
Okay.

2453
02:32:53,710 --> 02:32:55,070
Maybe this is not working.

2454
02:32:55,550 --> 02:32:56,310
So, uh...

2455
02:32:56,310 --> 02:32:57,190
He's so shivery.

2456
02:32:57,590 --> 02:32:58,030
You cold, buddy.

2457
02:32:58,150 --> 02:32:58,970
You just go inside.

2458
02:32:59,470 --> 02:33:00,410
There's no one here anyway.

2459
02:33:00,850 --> 02:33:01,690
Nothing here.

2460
02:33:02,270 --> 02:33:03,470
I can do the report for you.

2461
02:33:03,830 --> 02:33:04,690
Nothing here.

2462
02:33:06,290 --> 02:33:06,410
Freeze.

2463
02:33:06,830 --> 02:33:07,070
Freeze.

2464
02:33:07,630 --> 02:33:07,650
Free.

2465
02:33:07,930 --> 02:33:08,190
Freeze.

2466
02:33:09,070 --> 02:33:09,630
Freeze.

2467
02:33:09,630 --> 02:33:09,890
Freeze.

2468
02:33:12,690 --> 02:33:13,170
Freeze!

2469
02:33:15,190 --> 02:33:18,270
Snake, if you were a mere 149, then a weird doll.

2470
02:33:18,770 --> 02:33:20,990
How small do you think I am?

2471
02:33:22,890 --> 02:33:23,370
Okay.

2472
02:33:24,230 --> 02:33:25,570
I think he's falling asleep.

2473
02:33:25,710 --> 02:33:26,390
I think so too.

2474
02:33:26,890 --> 02:33:28,610
But then how did we get it to work before?

2475
02:33:29,490 --> 02:33:29,590
Hmm.

2476
02:33:30,570 --> 02:33:31,050
Weird.

2477
02:33:31,810 --> 02:33:32,790
Okay, hold on.

2478
02:33:34,210 --> 02:33:35,450
You know what?

2479
02:33:36,070 --> 02:33:36,910
I'm gonna, okay.

2480
02:33:37,410 --> 02:33:38,530
This might not work.

2481
02:33:40,110 --> 02:33:42,550
This might not work, but...

2482
02:33:42,570 --> 02:33:43,890
If we die, whatever.

2483
02:33:44,330 --> 02:33:44,830
At least we tried.

2484
02:33:47,970 --> 02:33:49,090
Did he wake up from that noise?

2485
02:34:10,410 --> 02:34:10,890
Uh.

2486
02:34:13,650 --> 02:34:14,670
Why didn't that work?

2487
02:34:14,850 --> 02:34:15,490
It exploded.

2488
02:34:17,270 --> 02:34:18,290
It went off.

2489
02:34:24,460 --> 02:34:25,680
It went off.

2490
02:34:26,120 --> 02:34:27,160
Why didn't it work?

2491
02:34:28,300 --> 02:34:29,780
Yeah, it didn't stun him at all.

2492
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:32,380
Oh my gosh.

2493
02:34:34,380 --> 02:34:35,900
Aren't you 152 centimeter?

2494
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:37,140
Yeah.

2495
02:34:38,540 --> 02:34:38,580
Duh.

2496
02:34:43,070 --> 02:34:45,290
They nerfed the stun grenade in this game.

2497
02:34:46,630 --> 02:34:47,910
Get closer for the freeze.

2498
02:34:48,270 --> 02:34:49,130
Okay, let's try it.

2499
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:53,780
Oh.

2500
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:54,920
Wait, hold on.

2501
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:55,360
Closer.

2502
02:34:57,640 --> 02:34:58,040
Freeze.

2503
02:34:58,520 --> 02:34:59,320
Oh, I got it.

2504
02:34:59,420 --> 02:34:59,760
I got it.

2505
02:35:00,420 --> 02:35:01,120
Um, okay.

2506
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:01,900

It will help a lot.

2519
02:37:14,610 --> 02:37:18,590
Yeah, I've been, like, drinking a lot of, like, throat,
like, teas for your throat.

2520
02:37:19,050 --> 02:37:21,010
Actually, I have a different tea, a throat tea.

2521
02:37:21,090 --> 02:37:21,610
I just remember.

2522
02:37:21,990 --> 02:37:23,530
Okay, I'll start drinking that, too.

2523
02:37:27,210 --> 02:37:31,630
And, uh, just kind of, like, having cough drops and stuff.

2524
02:37:41,580 --> 02:37:49,340
daily but I fear I feel I actually have a genuine fear
because like I can't hit high notes like I did before I'm

2525
02:37:49,340 --> 02:37:58,640
scared maybe a vocal coach could help as well maybe yeah I
was thinking I've been trying to like I was thinking or

2526
02:37:58,640 --> 02:38:05,080
rather I was doing like some light vocal exercises but I
don't want to like do so much and then make it worse on

2527
02:38:05,080 --> 02:38:09,080
accident you know so So I'm kind of like, what do I do?

2528
02:38:14,370 --> 02:38:15,410
He's going to look over?

2529
02:38:34,450 --> 02:38:36,730
It was risky, but I took the risk.

2530
02:38:43,380 --> 02:38:45,000
Do some hypnotherapy for your throat.

2531
02:38:46,040 --> 02:38:46,400
Yeah.

2532
02:38:49,960 --> 02:38:51,380
Lead singer of a band...

2533
02:38:51,380 --> 02:38:53,260
Wait, I went to the wrong one again.

2534
02:38:54,100 --> 02:38:55,960
He broke a blood vessel and sink...

2535
02:38:55,960 --> 02:38:58,240
Wait, I can't tell if you're being serious or not.

2536
02:38:59,780 --> 02:39:00,920
Throw it in now, things better than ever.

2537
02:39:01,140 --> 02:39:01,800
What does that mean?

2538
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:03,160
Wait, wait, is that real?

2539
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:10,620
Oh, I do have the level 6 card!

2540
02:39:12,140 --> 02:39:13,420
You're so right!

2541
02:39:14,040 --> 02:39:15,080
Wait, where was...

2542
02:39:15,080 --> 02:39:16,400
What was in...

2543
02:39:17,740 --> 02:39:18,540
What was...

2544
02:39:18,540 --> 02:39:20,060
Was there any level 6 down there?

2545
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:20,760
I can't remember.

2546
02:39:21,100 --> 02:39:21,780
Let's try it, though.

2547
02:39:22,840 --> 02:39:23,760
Is it pretty flabby?

2548
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:26,580
No, it's just, like...

2549
02:39:27,700 --> 02:39:28,980
Raspier than usual.

2550
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:31,220
Like, if I...

2551
02:39:31,220 --> 02:39:32,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2552
02:39:35,240 --> 02:39:38,960
If I sing high, like sometimes I just can't hit the note.

2553
02:39:40,540 --> 02:39:41,940
All of these I can go into.

2554
02:39:42,440 --> 02:39:42,920
Yeah, four.

2555
02:39:44,260 --> 02:39:45,400
That one I can go into.

2556
02:39:47,900 --> 02:39:48,800
This one.

2557
02:39:50,100 --> 02:39:50,800
This is two.

2558
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:52,240
It's this one.

2559
02:39:54,280 --> 02:39:55,600
Uh, I can't read.

2560
02:39:55,860 --> 02:39:56,120
Six!

2561
02:39:59,320 --> 02:40:00,520
Body armor!

2562
02:40:04,630 --> 02:40:05,570
I was good too.

2563
02:40:06,190 --> 02:40:06,190
Four.

2564
02:40:06,490 --> 02:40:06,490
Yeah.

2565
02:40:08,990 --> 02:40:11,430
Gosh, taking out the cameras and them staying out.

2566
02:40:11,490 --> 02:40:12,630
No one wants to come back here.

2567
02:40:12,730 --> 02:40:14,330
Of course they just keep the cameras dead.

2568
02:40:21,760 --> 02:40:23,880
Last time I had a bad cough, it took like two months to
recover.

2569
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:24,420
Oof.

2570
02:40:24,920 --> 02:40:25,720
It was only...

2571
02:40:25,720 --> 02:40:26,640
It wasn't a bad cough.

2572
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:28,760
It was just that I lost my...

2573
02:40:29,200 --> 02:40:32,840
I had lost my voice from getting sick.

2574
02:40:33,460 --> 02:40:34,860
It just hasn't recovered since.

2575
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:37,620
Well, we can't see Otacon.

2576
02:40:38,740 --> 02:40:41,340
I mean, well, obviously, but we can't even see that area.

2577
02:40:52,150 --> 02:40:53,670
Sometimes it just takes time.

2578
02:40:54,230 --> 02:40:55,710
I'll be patient then.

2579
02:40:58,490 --> 02:40:59,930
I will be patient.

2580
02:41:04,290 --> 02:41:08,030
The commander is waiting for you, Mr. Foxhound.

2581
02:41:12,830 --> 02:41:13,950
Gosh, everything...

2582
02:41:14,910 --> 02:41:16,270
Meal, ready to eat.

2583
02:41:17,390 --> 02:41:17,610
Um.

2584
02:41:18,690 --> 02:41:22,470
Everything is, like, so, uh...

2585
02:41:23,370 --> 02:41:24,790
So quick to respawn.

2586
02:41:26,070 --> 02:41:26,750
It's kind of awesome.

2587
02:41:28,590 --> 02:41:29,730
Is there anything else in here?

2588
02:41:30,970 --> 02:41:32,550
My eardrums are rumbling.

2589
02:41:35,450 --> 02:41:37,190
My eardrums are rumbling.

2590
02:41:37,370 --> 02:41:38,970
Oh, what's on there?

2591
02:41:40,630 --> 02:41:41,270
Nothing.

2592
02:41:43,010 --> 02:41:43,970
What if it was...

2593
02:41:43,990 --> 02:41:44,510
Can you imagine?

2594
02:41:44,630 --> 02:41:45,670
What if it was, like, Newgrounds?

2595
02:41:47,390 --> 02:41:48,150
Like, Psycho Mantis.

2596
02:41:48,290 --> 02:41:48,590
What are you...

2597
02:41:48,590 --> 02:41:48,890
What are you...

2598
02:41:48,890 --> 02:41:49,350
What are you doing?

2599
02:41:50,910 --> 02:41:51,130
Okay.

2600
02:41:54,910 --> 02:41:55,670

Oh, this is the tranquilizer.

2608
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:18,900
We don't need any of this.

2609
02:42:20,320 --> 02:42:20,620
Oh.

02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:21,650

Listen to me.

2649
02:44:35,280 --> 02:44:35,980
Oh, it does still happen.

2650
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:38,600
I wasn't able to protect her.

2651
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:39,820
No, I don't think so.

2652
02:44:40,040 --> 02:44:41,520
Snake, it's okay.

2653
02:44:42,320 --> 02:44:43,240
You did what you could.

2654
02:44:43,620 --> 02:44:44,520
Now let it rest.

2655
02:44:45,080 --> 02:44:45,460
Colonel.

2656
02:44:45,900 --> 02:44:47,760
She joined up of her own free will.

2657
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:50,140
I'm sure she was prepared for this.

2658
02:44:50,940 --> 02:44:52,160
No, you're wrong.

2659
02:44:54,860 --> 02:44:56,540
Meryl thought she had to become a soldier.

2660
02:44:57,080 --> 02:44:58,200
Thought it was the only way.

2661
02:44:59,100 --> 02:45:01,820
She said she thought it would bring her closer to her dead
father.

2662
02:45:02,560 --> 02:45:03,520
She said that.

2663
02:45:04,240 --> 02:45:06,160
She wasn't ready for real combat.

2664
02:45:06,760 --> 02:45:08,180
I shouldn't have pushed her so hard.

2665
02:45:08,480 --> 02:45:08,740
No.

2666
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:09,780
It's all my fault.

2667
02:45:10,240 --> 02:45:11,460
That's not like you, Snake.

2668
02:45:11,600 --> 02:45:12,180
Oh, Master.

2669
02:45:12,500 --> 02:45:13,400
What is it?

2670
02:45:13,400 --> 02:45:14,360
Master Miller?

2671
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:15,080
Ha ha ha!

2672
02:45:15,500 --> 02:45:17,200
Master Miller Jump scare!

2673
02:45:17,780 --> 02:45:24,860
master snake you can have regrets if you want to it's only
natural but you can't keep attacking yourself for things

2674
02:45:24,860 --> 02:45:32,300
that happened in the past nothing good will come from that
he's right don't kick yourself it doesn't suit a legend like

2675
02:45:32,300 --> 02:45:43,060
you and besides that for all we know merrill's okay right
okay snake forget about merrill stop liquid that's what

2676
02:45:43,060 --> 02:45:48,040
merrill would want to you're right Snake.

2677
02:45:49,600 --> 02:45:50,080
Merrill.

2678
02:45:50,820 --> 02:45:52,120
She's pretty special to you, huh?

2679
02:45:52,740 --> 02:45:55,360
Well, yeah, special.

2680
02:45:55,720 --> 02:45:56,820
Master is such a good guy.

2681
02:45:56,880 --> 02:45:58,400
There aren't many tomboyes like her.

2682
02:45:58,680 --> 02:45:59,160
Tomboy?

2683
02:45:59,240 --> 02:46:00,040
That's not what I meant.

2684
02:46:00,740 --> 02:46:03,540
She's the Colonel's niece and a combat buddy.

2685
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:04,800
Oh my god, combat buddy!

2686
02:46:05,340 --> 02:46:06,060
Come on.

2687
02:46:06,160 --> 02:46:07,940
This is like a police interrogation.

2688
02:46:08,420 --> 02:46:09,700
No, I just...

2689
02:46:09,700 --> 02:46:11,360
I guess it's in the jeans.

2690
02:46:12,100 --> 02:46:12,440
The jeans.

2691
02:46:13,380 --> 02:46:13,400
What do you mean?

2692
02:46:13,400 --> 02:46:14,600
What are you talking about, Colonel?

2693
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:15,080
Tomboy love?

2694
02:46:16,120 --> 02:46:17,760
No, I just remembered about it.

02:46:17,780 --> 02:46:26,760
Naomi's grandfather I think Naomi said he rose as high as
assistant secretary in the FBI during Edgar Hoover's time is

2696

Oh, bless you.

2703
02:47:22,890 --> 02:47:24,710
He sneezes so much more in this area.

2704
02:47:24,930 --> 02:47:25,450
It's kind of weird.

2705
02:47:26,230 --> 02:47:26,970
Okay, Martin, thank you!

There we go.

2708
02:47:33,250 --> 02:47:37,150
The problem with you being on the team is the second snake
flirted with you.

2709
02:47:37,370 --> 02:47:39,950
You'd scream, hang up with Kodak, and never call again.

2710
02:47:43,350 --> 02:47:43,970
Bless you.

2711
02:47:46,150 --> 02:47:47,310
Don't say that.

2712
02:47:51,160 --> 02:47:51,560
Ah!

2713
02:47:52,120 --> 02:47:52,860
Oh yeah, bubba.

2714
02:47:53,240 --> 02:47:54,960
I'm gonna try and shoot this one down.

2715
02:48:05,020 --> 02:48:05,820
There we go.

2716
02:48:07,380 --> 02:48:08,860
Oh wait, my rations are full anyway.

2717
02:48:10,180 --> 02:48:10,960

Chew.

2724
02:48:24,400 --> 02:48:25,900
I can't wait for the call.

2725
02:48:26,320 --> 02:48:29,620
I can't wait for the call where he's just like, That girl is
weird!

2726
02:48:30,220 --> 02:48:31,720
That girl is not normal!

2727
02:48:32,340 --> 02:48:33,840

2728
02:48:36,630 --> 02:48:39,270
That girl is...

2729
02:48:39,270 --> 02:48:40,530
Telling lies!

2730
02:48:43,350 --> 02:48:44,830
Where's a little rat?

2731
02:48:46,210 --> 02:48:47,710
Where's a little rat?

2732
02:48:47,950 --> 02:48:49,650
I'm gonna take down a little rat.

2733
02:48:50,690 --> 02:48:51,230
Oh, there is one!

2734
02:48:51,310 --> 02:48:51,530

2735
02:49:00,030 --> 02:49:01,150
There we go!

2736
02:49:02,710 --> 02:49:03,430
Oh!

2737
02:49:06,810 --> 02:49:08,990
Oh, I gotta, I gotta put in the other disc.

2738
02:49:09,290 --> 02:49:09,830
Hold out, you guys.

2739
02:49:12,450 --> 02:49:12,850
Yippee!

2740
02:49:13,470 --> 02:49:15,470
Time to change the disc, everyone.

2741
02:49:18,470 --> 02:49:19,430
Take it out.

2742
02:49:20,290 --> 02:49:21,390
And let me put it in here.

2743
02:49:21,490 --> 02:49:22,330
Let me grab the other one.

2744
02:49:23,410 --> 02:49:23,750
Okay.

2745
02:49:24,410 --> 02:49:24,650
Okay.

2746
02:49:25,410 --> 02:49:27,970
My, the first disc, unfortunately, has some, like, damage.

2747
02:49:28,050 --> 02:49:29,190
It's kind of, like, cracked a little.

2748
02:49:31,990 --> 02:49:32,370
Okay.

2749
02:49:33,150 --> 02:49:33,550
Disc.

2750
02:49:35,980 --> 02:49:36,980
Wait, for some reason...

2751
02:49:38,400 --> 02:49:38,780
Wait.

2752
02:49:39,080 --> 02:49:39,960
I always thought that disc...

2753
02:49:39,980 --> 02:49:40,620
disc too.

2754
02:49:41,120 --> 02:49:43,760
Wait, Otacon is supposed to tell you to change the discs,
isn't he?

2755
02:49:44,340 --> 02:49:50,480
I thought it was after um, I could have sworn it was after

2756
02:49:55,700 --> 02:49:57,120
after sniper wolf.

2757
02:49:58,480 --> 02:49:58,480
Hmm.

2758
02:50:00,840 --> 02:50:01,980
Oh, it's just an MGS4.

2759
02:50:02,620 --> 02:50:02,700
Wow.

2760
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:04,160
Wait, hold on.

2766
02:50:32,280 --> 02:50:39,660

are dangerous places you can't see where your enemies are

night vision or thermal goggles if you want thermal goggles

2770
02:51:12,970 --> 02:51:19,810
there's a pair on the same floor as my lab be careful there

Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.

2775
02:51:48,750 --> 02:51:50,410
Old time is still a flying.

2776
02:51:51,170 --> 02:51:55,350
And this same flower that smiles today, tomorrow will be
dying.

2777
02:51:56,430 --> 02:51:58,250
Snake, laughter is the best medicine.

2778
02:51:58,690 --> 02:52:01,090
You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a
game.

2779
02:52:01,830 --> 02:52:02,730
Enjoy yourself, okay?

2780

Thanks.

2782
02:52:10,590 --> 02:52:14,610
When you're in a dark place, you should use night vision or
thermal goggles.

2783
02:52:14,730 --> 02:52:15,690
Is it really that dark in?

2784
02:52:15,750 --> 02:52:16,270
Oh, okay.

2785
02:52:17,030 --> 02:52:18,390

I can see perfectly fine.

2791
02:52:28,810 --> 02:52:29,770

Oh, it did go off.

02:54:15,810 --> 02:54:16,690
Oh, oh my god.

2815
02:54:20,500 --> 02:54:22,900
No, I'm trying to auto-aim at no one.

2816
02:54:23,500 --> 02:54:24,140
Oh my god.

2817
02:54:28,320 --> 02:54:29,020

Oh, oh my gosh.

Oh, I'm stuck.

02:55:56,040 --> 02:55:57,100
Wait, I'm actually stuck!

2829
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:00,400

Wait.

2835
02:56:31,700 --> 02:56:32,480
There's a ladder?

2836
02:56:40,430 --> 02:56:43,610
Oh, I see it.

2837
02:56:43,650 --> 02:56:44,030
I see it.

2838
02:56:44,070 --> 02:56:44,410
I see it.

2839
02:56:45,110 --> 02:56:46,330
Thank you guys.

2840
02:56:49,390 --> 02:56:50,790
gain our health a little bit.

2841
02:56:53,370 --> 02:56:55,810
Because I remember the other door is stuck, right?

2842
02:56:55,910 --> 02:56:58,290
It's frozen shut, so you can't get to it.

2843
02:57:02,080 --> 02:57:03,100
What a thrill.

2844
02:57:09,970 --> 02:57:12,430
Yeah, so that's why I remember running just past it.

2845
02:57:12,490 --> 02:57:15,110
I was like, it's time.

2846
02:57:17,530 --> 02:57:19,430
It's time, it's time, it's time.

2847
02:57:19,490 --> 02:57:20,570
It's quiet up here.

2848
02:57:23,370 --> 02:57:31,610

the matter snake you out of shape from all that dog mushing

2850

automated response

2851
02:57:58,960 --> 02:58:00,360
Why do you say it like that?

2852
02:58:00,460 --> 02:58:01,100
I know, right?

2853
02:58:01,600 --> 02:58:02,560
What are you doing, Master?

2854
02:58:02,760 --> 02:58:04,120
Why won't you pick up?

2855
02:58:05,860 --> 02:58:07,660
Otacon, I'm up on the roof.

2856
02:58:08,120 --> 02:58:09,400
That was a pretty fast climb.

2857
02:58:10,220 --> 02:58:13,800
I wanted to go slowly, but someone there forced me to move
faster.

2858
02:58:14,120 --> 02:58:14,600
Oh, gosh.

2859
02:58:15,580 --> 02:58:18,560
Well, you can relax because there's an elevator in Tower B.

2860
02:58:18,700 --> 02:58:19,020
Good.

2861
02:58:19,160 --> 02:58:21,180
That walkway will take you to Tower B.

2862
02:58:21,340 --> 02:58:21,860
Oh, thank goodness.

2863
02:58:22,060 --> 02:58:25,720
Surely there won't be anything like in the elevator or
anything.

2864
02:58:25,940 --> 02:58:27,340
We'll just go down.

2865
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:27,700
We'll just...

2866
02:58:27,720 --> 02:58:33,660
go all the way down and we'll relax while doing it you know
oh my gosh sorry i'm like it keeps kind of stretching

2867
02:58:33,660 --> 02:58:45,540
because my oh so um not last night the night before last um
when i was sleeping my cat he was sleeping next to me and he

2868
02:58:45,540 --> 02:58:52,820

about to throw up they do like the you know and i like woke

directly at me and if i hadn't woken up he would have just

2870
02:58:58,300 --> 02:59:09,080

i like try to gently get him off of my bed but i slip i slip

2871
02:59:09,080 --> 02:59:18,820
and i um right next to my bed i have a cat tower for him
because he likes to climb it and i slip and i i bash my head

2872
02:59:18,820 --> 02:59:28,200
into the corner of the of the cat tower i i'm like i have
like a like I have a bump on my head from where I want where

2873
02:59:28,200 --> 02:59:36,120

zoom in you can see it but I have like I cut my nose and I

2874
02:59:36,120 --> 02:59:43,340

2877
02:59:58,380 --> 03:00:06,100

need to like work my ectoplasm a little bit more oh luckily

2878
03:00:06,100 --> 03:00:12,680
you're already dead i know right i know otherwise i would
have been in a big trouble and it was so close it was so

2879
03:00:12,680 --> 03:00:20,020

eye it was i was like oh my gosh i'm such a mess it was such

2880
03:00:20,020 --> 03:00:25,600

Ugh.

2881
03:00:26,240 --> 03:00:27,580
Anyway, who else was I calling?

2882
03:00:28,200 --> 03:00:28,680
Nistasha.

2883
03:00:30,020 --> 03:00:31,100
I wonder how Deep Throat's doing.

2884
03:00:31,480 --> 03:00:33,320
I wonder who that guy is.

2885
03:00:33,480 --> 03:00:33,620
I wonder who that guy is.

2886
03:00:33,720 --> 03:00:36,300
To coincide with the signing of the START III Accord.

2887
03:00:36,680 --> 03:00:36,860
Hmm.

2888
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:42,960
According to the terms of START III, both Russia and the US
are to reduce the number of nuclear warheads in deployment.

2889
03:00:42,960 --> 03:00:44,360
You were gonna have an eye patch.

2890
03:00:44,700 --> 03:00:46,960
22,000 and 2,500 missiles.

2891
03:00:47,760 --> 03:00:49,000
It was my left...

2892
03:00:49,600 --> 03:00:52,420
My left eye, so...

2893
03:00:52,420 --> 03:00:54,000
I would have been...

2894
03:00:55,060 --> 03:00:55,500
No.

2895
03:00:57,040 --> 03:00:58,340
Yeah, I would have been Solidus.

2896
03:00:58,440 --> 03:00:59,100
It was my left eye.

2897
03:01:00,460 --> 03:01:03,160
It's a big concern for him and his supporters.

2898
03:01:08,380 --> 03:01:08,880
Did I save?

2899
03:01:09,380 --> 03:01:10,000
I don't think I did.

2900
03:01:10,360 --> 03:01:11,220
We'll do it just in case again.

2901
03:01:11,260 --> 03:01:11,840
What is it, Snake?

2902
03:01:13,720 --> 03:01:13,760
Oh.

2903
03:01:14,460 --> 03:01:14,800
I know.

2904
03:01:17,480 --> 03:01:18,360
Typical politician.

2905
03:01:18,960 --> 03:01:19,460
Of course.

2906
03:01:20,580 --> 03:01:21,200
Of course.

2907
03:01:24,120 --> 03:01:24,780
Beep, beep.

2908
03:01:29,940 --> 03:01:30,380
Beep.

2909
03:01:30,680 --> 03:01:30,980
Okay.

2910
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:42,840

kidnapping.

2914
03:02:05,040 --> 03:02:06,720
Let's not romanticize how this happened.

2915
03:02:16,940 --> 03:02:18,580
It's kind of spooky.

2916
03:02:26,190 --> 03:02:27,290
Oh, there's the door.

2917
03:02:35,060 --> 03:02:36,360
Seems pretty safe.

2918
03:02:41,610 --> 03:02:43,490
Seems pretty safe.

2919
03:02:44,590 --> 03:02:47,150
Is there anything in here that I can...

2920
03:02:47,410 --> 03:02:47,730
No.

2921
03:02:50,630 --> 03:02:51,670
It's quiet.

2922
03:02:53,070 --> 03:02:53,150
Quiet.

2923
03:03:00,900 --> 03:03:01,420
Whoa!

2924
03:03:05,410 --> 03:03:07,290
Oh my god!

2925
03:03:09,450 --> 03:03:10,810
Run, Snake, run!

2926
03:03:11,690 --> 03:03:12,930
Oh my- Whoa!

2927
03:03:23,410 --> 03:03:24,450
Snake!

2928
03:03:25,250 --> 03:03:25,870
Dodge, Snake!

2929
03:03:26,650 --> 03:03:27,670
No way.

2930
03:03:30,230 --> 03:03:30,930
Throw it!

2931
03:03:30,950 --> 03:03:31,530
Wait, Snake!

2932
03:03:31,830 --> 03:03:32,550
Throw it!

2933
03:03:33,250 --> 03:03:33,750
Oh my god.

2934
03:03:34,090 --> 03:03:35,070
Wait, Snake, you're gonna fall!

2935
03:03:35,210 --> 03:03:36,770
Oh wait, that's not how that works.

2936
03:03:39,410 --> 03:03:40,630
He stopped the momentum.

2937
03:03:40,750 --> 03:03:43,010
He hit the invisible wall and stopped the momentum!

2938
03:03:46,590 --> 03:03:48,070
How did that happen?

2939
03:03:50,690 --> 03:03:51,850
Let's go, Snake.

2940
03:03:52,330 --> 03:03:53,690
Blew that up with a grenade.

2941
03:03:54,130 --> 03:03:54,970
Perfect plan.

2942
03:03:55,090 --> 03:03:56,690
Exactly what I would have thought of too.

2943
03:04:00,210 --> 03:04:00,930
Where did those move?

2944
03:04:00,950 --> 03:04:01,710
missiles come from.

2945
03:04:03,750 --> 03:04:07,870
I'm going to take care of some errands, but I'm now ready
for a minute to take on Kojimbo's Wild Ride Part 2.

2946
03:04:08,830 --> 03:04:10,090
Time to run from a helicopter.

2947
03:04:10,930 --> 03:04:12,710
Oh my gosh!

2948
03:04:13,070 --> 03:04:14,050
A hindee!

2949
03:04:15,430 --> 03:04:17,970
What's a Russian gunship doing in an area like this?

2950
03:04:21,330 --> 03:04:21,810
Liquid.

2951
03:04:22,270 --> 03:04:25,150
I'm afraid I can't let you get past here.

2952
03:04:25,950 --> 03:04:26,250
Liquid.

2953
03:04:27,290 --> 03:04:29,310
You're not going any farther.

2954
03:04:29,650 --> 03:04:30,010
Whoa.

2955
03:04:34,950 --> 03:04:48,850

2958
03:05:06,470 --> 03:05:06,870
Uh.

2959
03:05:08,390 --> 03:05:09,590
This isn't where I fight him.

2960
03:05:09,750 --> 03:05:10,270
I go...

2961
03:05:10,830 --> 03:05:11,230
I...

2962
03:05:11,230 --> 03:05:12,410
I go down first, right?

2963
03:05:15,650 --> 03:05:16,830
Oh, I did get a rope!

2964
03:05:20,230 --> 03:05:21,210
I did get a rope.

2965
03:05:21,330 --> 03:05:22,470
I didn't even notice it.

2966
03:05:24,070 --> 03:05:24,650
Here we go.

2967
03:05:30,780 --> 03:05:31,180
Wee!

2968
03:05:32,080 --> 03:05:32,480
Whoa!

2969
03:05:33,340 --> 03:05:33,740
Whoa!

2970
03:05:35,420 --> 03:05:36,500
That's close.

2971
03:05:41,440 --> 03:05:42,760
Time to do this.

2972
03:05:43,260 --> 03:05:43,460
Whatever.

2973
03:05:43,860 --> 03:05:44,760
However this works.

2974
03:05:45,580 --> 03:05:45,680
Uh.

2975
03:05:46,460 --> 03:05:47,000
Okay.

2976
03:05:47,900 --> 03:05:49,040
Uh, I'm moving.

2977
03:05:49,760 --> 03:05:50,800
I'm not moving.

2978
03:05:51,300 --> 03:05:52,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2979
03:05:52,660 --> 03:05:53,740
Okay, it's still a cutscene.

2980
03:05:54,520 --> 03:05:55,640
Okay, I'm moving.

2981
03:05:56,460 --> 03:05:57,360
And I'm going down.

2982
03:05:57,800 --> 03:05:58,660
Uh, yes, please.

2983
03:06:00,880 --> 03:06:01,860
Thanks, Colonel.

2984
03:06:02,040 --> 03:06:04,220
Click the A button to kick away from the wall.

2985
03:06:04,720 --> 03:06:08,420
While away from the wall, push down on the control stick to
descend.

2986
03:06:08,660 --> 03:06:15,280
Okay, if you kick off the wall while pushing the control
stick left or right, you make a large jump in that

2987
03:06:15,280 --> 03:06:15,580
direction.

2988
03:06:15,600 --> 03:06:17,040
He's so, he's so quiet.

2989
03:06:17,380 --> 03:06:21,360
You can walk slowly across the wall if you press and hold
the B button.

2990
03:06:21,840 --> 03:06:22,320
Why would it?

2991
03:06:22,320 --> 03:06:28,260
To move a little at a time in a certain direction, push the
control stick while holding the B button.

2992
03:06:29,080 --> 03:06:34,500
If you're careful with the timing, you should be able to
dodge the gunfire from behind while you repel down.

2993
03:06:34,540 --> 03:06:34,700
Okay.

2994
03:06:34,720 --> 03:06:37,680
If anyone can do it, you can, Snake.

2995
03:06:40,660 --> 03:06:41,420
That's it.

2996
03:06:41,580 --> 03:06:41,760
All right.

2997
03:06:41,880 --> 03:06:42,600
Oh, here we go.

2998
03:06:44,420 --> 03:06:45,520
Oh, gosh.

2999
03:06:45,800 --> 03:06:46,140
Oh, my gosh.

3000
03:06:47,120 --> 03:06:48,160
I'm just...

3001
03:06:48,160 --> 03:06:48,940
Oh, there's a...

3002
03:06:48,940 --> 03:06:49,880
There's a ration.

3003
03:06:51,420 --> 03:06:52,080
Oh, nice.

3004
03:06:52,720 --> 03:06:53,360
Oh, my God.

3005
03:06:53,940 --> 03:06:54,840
I somehow got it.

3006
03:06:55,600 --> 03:06:58,540
Oh, I don't know how I'm doing this.

3007
03:07:00,920 --> 03:07:01,800
I'm pushing off it.

3008
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:02,280
Oh, my gosh.

3009
03:07:02,800 --> 03:07:02,980
Oh.

3010
03:07:03,760 --> 03:07:04,280
Nice.

3011
03:07:05,240 --> 03:07:06,680
I think I'm cracked at this.

3012
03:07:06,900 --> 03:07:07,860
Oh, was that it?

3013
03:07:08,320 --> 03:07:09,920
Wait, I didn't...

3014
03:07:19,570 --> 03:07:20,810
That was not me.

3015
03:07:21,090 --> 03:07:21,990
That was all snake.

3016
03:07:22,770 --> 03:07:23,850
I didn't get hit what?

3017
03:07:24,810 --> 03:07:26,770
They were so kind with that part.

3018
03:07:27,170 --> 03:07:27,670
For real!

3019
03:07:29,890 --> 03:07:32,510
$20 for my 20th super chat.

3020
03:07:32,630 --> 03:07:33,250
No way.

3021
03:07:35,170 --> 03:07:36,150
Thank you!

3022
03:07:38,890 --> 03:07:40,270
What is that?

3023
03:07:41,490 --> 03:07:42,330
Who's breathing?

3024
03:07:44,150 --> 03:07:44,590
Oh.

3025
03:07:47,210 --> 03:07:48,030
Can I...

3026
03:07:48,030 --> 03:07:49,610
Oh, maybe I can see for this now.

3027
03:07:54,180 --> 03:07:55,660
Uh, how do I use it yet?

3028
03:07:57,460 --> 03:07:58,540
A button to set.

3029
03:08:29,350 --> 03:08:29,730
Huh?

3030
03:08:30,870 --> 03:08:32,650
What's wrong with the alert though?

3031
03:08:37,120 --> 03:08:37,380
Huh?

3032
03:08:41,710 --> 03:08:42,150
Huh?

3033
03:08:46,910 --> 03:08:48,730
There are people over here though, aren't there?

3034
03:08:51,570 --> 03:08:52,350
Yeah, I see him.

3035
03:08:52,430 --> 03:08:53,130
I see him.

3036
03:08:55,350 --> 03:08:55,710
Um...

3037
03:08:55,710 --> 03:08:57,530
Let's take these guys out.

3038
03:09:00,070 --> 03:09:00,430
Crouch.

3039
03:09:01,230 --> 03:09:02,410
Take my meds.

3040
03:09:05,550 --> 03:09:05,830
Here.

3041
03:09:13,760 --> 03:09:15,060
I have to be really fast though.

3042
03:09:15,120 --> 03:09:16,220
I have to be like, boom, bam, boom.

3043
03:09:16,880 --> 03:09:17,280
Oh gosh.

3044
03:09:21,280 --> 03:09:22,200
Did I kill him?

3045
03:09:22,660 --> 03:09:23,980
Wait, wait, I can't see them at all.

3046
03:09:24,120 --> 03:09:24,580
Oh my gosh.

3047
03:09:25,100 --> 03:09:26,060
I can't see them at all.

3048
03:09:27,060 --> 03:09:31,680
Wait, they're not, they're not coming down, are they?

3049
03:09:32,140 --> 03:09:32,320
Ah!

3050
03:09:37,490 --> 03:09:39,830
Oh my gosh, scared me.

3051
03:09:41,810 --> 03:09:43,730
You guys could warn me.

3052
03:09:44,070 --> 03:09:44,170
Oh.

3053
03:09:54,950 --> 03:09:56,790
They won't be able to see me like this, though.

3054
03:10:04,860 --> 03:10:06,080
Oh, they can see me like this.

3055
03:10:06,440 --> 03:10:06,640
Ow!

3056
03:10:19,330 --> 03:10:20,550
Try the Nikita.

3057
03:10:21,210 --> 03:10:21,790
I don't want to...

3058
03:10:21,790 --> 03:10:23,490
Wait, how many do I have?

3059
03:10:23,510 --> 03:10:25,530
of 40?

3060
03:10:28,410 --> 03:10:29,090
Well, hold on.

3061
03:10:29,190 --> 03:10:30,630
Let's see if the guys are still here.

3062
03:10:31,210 --> 03:10:33,690
If they respawned all three of them.

3063
03:10:33,930 --> 03:10:34,430
They did.

3064
03:10:36,210 --> 03:10:38,190
They did respawn all three of them.

3065
03:10:41,840 --> 03:10:43,500
It doesn't feel any easier.

3066
03:10:44,260 --> 03:10:44,580
You know?

3067
03:10:45,060 --> 03:10:46,200
Until I get them.

3068
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:48,360
Hmm.

3069
03:10:49,980 --> 03:10:51,240
I could Nikita them.

3070
03:10:51,760 --> 03:10:54,160
If I Nikita one of them, well, I get all three of them.

3071
03:10:55,240 --> 03:10:56,040
I wonder.

3072
03:10:57,380 --> 03:10:58,500
Wait, okay, how do I use this thing?

3073
03:10:59,560 --> 03:11:00,000
A.

3074
03:11:00,720 --> 03:11:01,980
Release the fire.

3075
03:11:04,320 --> 03:11:04,540
Okay.

3076
03:11:09,410 --> 03:11:10,970
Here we go!

3077
03:11:14,230 --> 03:11:15,750
They're not gonna shoot it down, are they?

3078
03:11:16,050 --> 03:11:16,170
Oh.

3079
03:11:18,610 --> 03:11:19,430
Don't shoot it down.

3080
03:11:19,970 --> 03:11:20,650
Don't shoot it down.

3081
03:11:29,920 --> 03:11:31,180
Are they all dead?

3082
03:11:31,880 --> 03:11:32,300
What do you mean?

3083
03:11:32,320 --> 03:11:41,680
no use this is the perfect time to use a scope what do you
mean no use no the other two guys are still up there you

3084
03:11:41,680 --> 03:11:50,560
guys I think it only took out one guy no What?

3085
03:11:51,860 --> 03:11:53,240
They're all still standing!

3086
03:11:55,740 --> 03:11:57,140
I'm still standing.

3087
03:11:58,000 --> 03:11:59,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3088
03:12:01,600 --> 03:12:02,220
What?

3089
03:12:05,540 --> 03:12:06,460
What?

3090
03:12:07,360 --> 03:12:09,040
That's insane.

3091
03:12:10,240 --> 03:12:11,660
That's insane.

3092
03:12:14,800 --> 03:12:15,500
Oh, dang it.

3093
03:12:15,580 --> 03:12:16,440
Where did they go?

3094
03:12:16,820 --> 03:12:17,960
Where do they run to?

3095
03:12:19,620 --> 03:12:20,880
Oh, uh...

3096
03:12:25,220 --> 03:12:26,800
There we go.

3097
03:12:28,180 --> 03:12:30,560
I think I got all three of them now.

3098
03:12:35,320 --> 03:12:36,400
Easy!

3099
03:12:45,840 --> 03:12:46,380
Pshah!

3100
03:12:47,180 --> 03:12:48,040
Pshah!

3101
03:12:48,880 --> 03:12:49,440
Pshah!

3102
03:12:50,620 --> 03:12:51,700
Oh!

3103
03:12:55,260 --> 03:12:55,380
Oh!

3104
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:57,540
Oh!

3105
03:12:58,360 --> 03:12:59,420
Stinger Missile!

3106
03:13:03,090 --> 03:13:04,170
Die!

3107
03:13:08,440 --> 03:13:10,440
That guy's so dumb.

3108
03:13:10,940 --> 03:13:10,960
Why?

3109
03:13:11,320 --> 03:13:14,140
You can't get me if you're in a helicopter and I can go
inside.

3110
03:13:16,420 --> 03:13:17,140
Idiot.

3111
03:13:18,840 --> 03:13:19,980
What a dummy.

3112
03:13:22,340 --> 03:13:24,020
What an idiot.

3113
03:13:24,200 --> 03:13:26,960
You can't go inside the building in your helicopter.

3114
03:13:29,440 --> 03:13:30,860
What a silly goose.

3115
03:13:37,700 --> 03:13:39,100
What am I thinking?

3116
03:13:39,680 --> 03:13:40,920
I gotta go down the elevator.

3117
03:13:44,200 --> 03:13:44,820
Good one, boss.

3118
03:13:45,820 --> 03:13:46,040
Thanks.

3119
03:13:48,420 --> 03:13:50,220
Gosh, he just doesn't have a brain.

3120
03:13:50,840 --> 03:13:52,580
He is the lesser...

3121
03:13:53,260 --> 03:13:56,500
He is the lesser clone.

3122
03:13:58,960 --> 03:14:00,840
The way to the top is blocked, huh?

3123
03:14:00,860 --> 03:14:08,780
well we can worry about that later why don't you go and see
what's happening below I don't I need to go why do I need to

3124
03:14:08,780 --> 03:14:19,000
go to the top master Miller what do you have to say no
response huh what are you busy doing snake I'm heading your

3125
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:26,280
way what are you talking about oh yeah well there's
something I've got to ask you well what is it hmm well you

3126
03:14:26,280 --> 03:14:28,680
see I'll ask you when I see you.

3127
03:14:29,140 --> 03:14:29,140
Bye.

3128
03:14:29,220 --> 03:14:30,240
The death flags.

3129
03:14:32,460 --> 03:14:33,840
He's gonna confess.

3130
03:14:34,880 --> 03:14:36,100
He's gonna confess.

3131
03:14:37,700 --> 03:14:37,880
He he.

3132
03:14:39,300 --> 03:14:39,700
He he.

3133
03:14:40,280 --> 03:14:41,820
You have Stinger missiles.

3134
03:14:42,420 --> 03:14:44,800
Now you have at least got a chance against the Hind.

3135
03:14:45,420 --> 03:14:46,220
Only a chance.

3136
03:14:46,720 --> 03:14:49,480
Well, you are not exactly evenly armed.

3137
03:14:50,160 --> 03:14:51,340
That Hind is a monster.

3138
03:14:51,760 --> 03:14:54,320
You only have a small chance to win.

3139
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:56,700
But at least it's better than no chance.

3140
03:14:57,860 --> 03:14:59,780
or a cold-hearted bunch, huh?

3141
03:15:00,180 --> 03:15:04,380
To shoot around that hind, you will have to get to a place
with good visibility.

3142
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:07,000
Do not try to fight in that walkway.

3143
03:15:07,100 --> 03:15:07,800
No, no, don't worry.

3144
03:15:07,820 --> 03:15:10,740
Get up on that roof, where you will have a clean shot at
him.

3145
03:15:10,780 --> 03:15:12,040
Yeah, Mr. Miller's in the bathroom.

3146
03:15:12,780 --> 03:15:13,160
It's okay.

3147
03:15:13,560 --> 03:15:14,520
He's human, you know?

3148
03:15:16,180 --> 03:15:17,720
Yeah, it's a good point.

3149
03:15:17,840 --> 03:15:18,700
I didn't think that...

3150
03:15:18,700 --> 03:15:22,200
I didn't even realize or, like, think about that I didn't
have the Singer Missiles.

3151
03:15:22,380 --> 03:15:23,520
So I was like, la la la, la.

3152
03:15:23,800 --> 03:15:26,440
Let's go and fight Hindy with my Nikita Missiles.

3153
03:15:26,740 --> 03:15:27,420
What is it, Snake?

3154
03:15:28,620 --> 03:15:30,660
We're just fighting within the key to myself.

3155
03:15:31,100 --> 03:15:31,680
No big D.

3156
03:15:31,880 --> 03:15:32,480
And BD.

3157
03:15:33,560 --> 03:15:35,340
If I go out there, is he still there?

3158
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:37,440
Or...

3159
03:15:37,440 --> 03:15:38,820
Because I kind of want the ration.

3160
03:15:39,780 --> 03:15:46,600
The proud man does not eat rotting meat, even when hungry,
nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts.

3161
03:15:46,920 --> 03:15:50,280
But on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find
every item you've got.

3162
03:15:50,720 --> 03:15:53,120
So I guess I shouldn't say that.

3163
03:15:53,180 --> 03:15:53,700
You shouldn't.

3164
03:15:54,020 --> 03:15:55,320
It's kind of insensitive.

3165
03:15:55,820 --> 03:15:57,840
Thank you for realizing.

3166
03:15:57,860 --> 03:15:58,400
that.

3167
03:15:59,180 --> 03:16:01,460
What the?

3168
03:16:03,240 --> 03:16:03,520
Huh?

3169
03:16:05,180 --> 03:16:06,520
That's so weird.

3170
03:16:08,820 --> 03:16:09,080
What?

3171
03:16:09,880 --> 03:16:11,430
Why wouldn't the elevator be working?

3172
03:16:13,060 --> 03:16:13,060
Hmm.

3173
03:16:15,780 --> 03:16:15,780
Hmm.

3174
03:16:16,260 --> 03:16:16,980
Fushigi.

3175
03:16:18,260 --> 03:16:18,420
Hmm.

3176
03:16:21,740 --> 03:16:22,560
Fushigi.

3177
03:16:23,960 --> 03:16:24,340
Dane.

3178
03:16:26,040 --> 03:16:36,340
It's kind of sus, not gonna lie it is a little sus right
like oh yeah i should probably be making sure that there's

3179
03:16:36,340 --> 03:16:53,440
no cameras tell me each way okay oh damn damn uh i didn't
notice that i i looked i looked at it

3180
03:16:57,860 --> 03:17:01,880
Liquid is a silly goose, since Snake is no maverick.

3181
03:17:02,280 --> 03:17:07,520
Meanwhile, AutoCAD is slowly becoming a good wingman by
melting Snake's ice man cold heart.

3182
03:17:07,900 --> 03:17:08,320
Oh my.

3183
03:17:08,640 --> 03:17:15,860
Oh, I would have had a good moment.

3184
03:17:16,560 --> 03:17:18,040
I forgot that there's grip in this game.

3185
03:17:19,920 --> 03:17:20,520
Good job, Snake.

3186
03:17:24,380 --> 03:17:27,280
Stop, you're going to make me want to watch Top Gun again.

3187
03:17:30,720 --> 03:17:32,110
Wait, is Otakon here?

3188
03:17:34,420 --> 03:17:34,780
Already?

3189
03:17:39,910 --> 03:17:41,580
Our little stealth guy.

3190
03:17:43,780 --> 03:17:44,920
Don't shoot!

3191
03:17:46,960 --> 03:17:48,320
Snake, you can put the gun down.

3192
03:17:48,760 --> 03:17:50,080
It's me, don't shoot.

3193
03:17:50,280 --> 03:17:51,860
You don't recognize his voice?

3194
03:17:52,260 --> 03:17:53,340
It's me, Snake.

3195
03:17:54,040 --> 03:17:56,140
Otakon, how'd you get here?

3196
03:17:57,400 --> 03:18:00,180
Well, it wasn't as dramatic as your entrance, believe me.

3197
03:18:02,860 --> 03:18:10,400
you were watching yeah I was watching watching the whole I
was riding in the back of their truck thanks to the stealth

3198
03:18:10,400 --> 03:18:21,640
camouflage whose truck how did you get up here the elevator
of course okay so you're telling me that these guys first

3199
03:18:21,640 --> 03:18:29,440
floor of the circular staircase was destroyed are just
chilling in the elevator that's why I took the elevator the

3200
03:18:29,440 --> 03:18:49,780
elevator was working yeah that's right yeah that's right
yeah yep just chilling the whole oh you're incredible like a

3201
03:18:49,780 --> 03:18:59,640
movie hero or something like a Japanese anime you're wrong
in the movies the hero always saves the girl you mean

3202
03:18:59,640 --> 03:19:03,700
Merrill sorry Forget I said anything.

3203
03:19:05,640 --> 03:19:06,720
It hurts.

3204
03:19:06,960 --> 03:19:08,140
It actually hurts more.

3205
03:19:08,560 --> 03:19:10,500
I feel like such a baby that I submitted.

3206
03:19:11,040 --> 03:19:13,000
There's something I've really got to ask you.

3207
03:19:15,200 --> 03:19:17,820
It's why I followed you up this far.

3208
03:19:18,500 --> 03:19:18,960
What's that?

3209
03:19:19,100 --> 03:19:22,440
Have you ever loved someone?

3210
03:19:24,100 --> 03:19:25,620
Why is the music so creepy?

3211
03:19:25,720 --> 03:19:26,460
That's what you came to ask.

3212
03:19:27,200 --> 03:19:29,480
No, I mean, I...

3213
03:19:29,480 --> 03:19:32,120
I was wondering if even soldiers...

3214
03:19:32,140 --> 03:19:47,740
fall in love what are you trying to say do you think love
can bloom even on a battlefield yeah yeah I do I think at

3215
03:19:47,740 --> 03:19:57,100
any time any place people can fall in love with each other
but if you love someone you have to be able to protect them

3216
03:19:57,100 --> 03:20:14,080
I think so too I have a favor to ask oh oh don't worry it'll
be easy he said the thing I told you before I won't hurt

3217
03:20:14,080 --> 03:20:25,480
anyone I don't want you to I'm starting here hungry oh look
at that playful shove the elevator is stopped down there I

3218
03:20:25,480 --> 03:20:31,420
want you to get it to move wait what do you mean down there
oh you see you see

3219
03:20:36,170 --> 03:20:47,750
that's weird that is weird it was working before but now it
isn't maybe the panel's broken can you fix it can you fix it

3220
03:20:47,750 --> 03:20:53,970
it was working before if it's the mechanism leave it to me
Matias!

3221
03:20:54,390 --> 03:20:55,390
Welcome to membership, thank you.

3222
03:20:55,450 --> 03:20:56,370
I've got to go and swat a noisy fly.

3223
03:20:56,890 --> 03:20:57,150
Yeah.

3224
03:20:58,470 --> 03:21:00,030
I'll stay here and hold the fort.

3225
03:21:00,890 --> 03:21:01,270
Good luck.

3226
03:21:01,450 --> 03:21:03,750
You'll definitely do that.

3227
03:21:04,830 --> 03:21:05,970
You really look like hell.

3228
03:21:06,310 --> 03:21:06,910
Are you okay?

3229
03:21:07,010 --> 03:21:07,310
Oh.

3230
03:21:14,110 --> 03:21:15,050
Don't worry.

3231
03:21:15,750 --> 03:21:18,030
If I do this, it doesn't matter.

3232
03:21:18,830 --> 03:21:19,770
Saku, thank you.

3233
03:21:20,950 --> 03:21:21,370
Aww.

3234
03:21:21,690 --> 03:21:23,350
I just pretend like I'm not here.

3235
03:21:24,450 --> 03:21:25,530
And then I'm not scared.

3236
03:21:26,650 --> 03:21:28,350
Looks like he's got a mustache.

3237
03:21:30,250 --> 03:21:30,810
Strange logic.

3238
03:21:32,610 --> 03:21:33,610
I'm counting on you.

3239
03:21:36,730 --> 03:21:38,630
That will become a handshake later.

3240
03:21:40,410 --> 03:21:43,050
There he goes, mysterious Sasquatch.

3241
03:21:45,490 --> 03:21:46,210
Oh, to God.

3242
03:21:47,170 --> 03:21:50,610
I love snakes like mocap in this.

3243
03:21:51,130 --> 03:21:51,610
Oh, nice!

3244
03:21:52,790 --> 03:21:53,590
I mean, not nice.

3245
03:21:53,710 --> 03:21:55,170
We're about to go fight a hindee.

3246
03:21:58,170 --> 03:21:58,810
It's strange.

3247
03:21:58,810 --> 03:22:00,970
It looks like Liquid really wants to have a showdown with
you.

3248
03:22:01,530 --> 03:22:04,630
I'm looking at maintenance digitally enhanced satellite
images right now.

3249
03:22:04,690 --> 03:22:05,510
He really wants to fight.

3250
03:22:06,150 --> 03:22:07,610
It seems he's waiting for you.

3251
03:22:08,250 --> 03:22:09,970
Like a vulture circling its prey.

3252
03:22:10,670 --> 03:22:12,990
I hope everyone's enjoying the live broadcast.

3253
03:22:13,270 --> 03:22:13,470
Are you?

3254
03:22:13,630 --> 03:22:14,130
Sorry, Snake.

3255
03:22:14,650 --> 03:22:16,130
I wish I could do something to help.

3256
03:22:16,330 --> 03:22:18,510
Snake, are you guys enjoying the live broadcast?

3257
03:22:18,570 --> 03:22:19,250
Please don't go up on the roof.

3258
03:22:19,590 --> 03:22:20,290
I have to.

3259
03:22:20,930 --> 03:22:22,530
I can't run from this one.

3260
03:22:27,210 --> 03:22:30,690
Sometimes there's like a long pause between the codecs.

3261
03:22:31,930 --> 03:22:32,810
Like when they're finishing them.

3262
03:22:34,110 --> 03:22:34,430
Master Miller.

3263
03:22:34,890 --> 03:22:35,290
What about you?

3264
03:22:35,370 --> 03:22:37,430
I'm about to go fight a helicopter, Master Miller.

3265
03:22:37,810 --> 03:22:38,970
I really need your advice.

3266
03:22:39,790 --> 03:22:40,330
I'm scared.

3267
03:22:40,910 --> 03:22:43,330
Okay, actually maybe Nastasha would be the most helpful
here.

3268
03:22:44,050 --> 03:22:45,530
You have Stinger missiles.

3269
03:22:46,130 --> 03:22:48,330
Now you have at least got a chance against the Hine.

3270
03:22:48,330 --> 03:22:48,650
Oh, wait.

3271
03:22:49,450 --> 03:22:50,050
Oh, okay.

3272
03:22:50,150 --> 03:22:51,030
She said the same thing.

3273
03:22:52,530 --> 03:22:55,670
After I beat the hind, we'll get something to eat.

3274
03:22:56,990 --> 03:22:58,810
You're going to go after that hind now?

3275
03:22:59,090 --> 03:22:59,270
Yep.

3276
03:23:00,130 --> 03:23:01,270
After your behind.

3277
03:23:01,770 --> 03:23:03,370
It's just circling the tower.

3278
03:23:03,870 --> 03:23:05,050
He must be waiting for you.

3279
03:23:05,570 --> 03:23:07,630
Well, you won't hear it for much longer.

3280
03:23:08,910 --> 03:23:11,950
In the meantime, I'll fix the elevator so you can use it
later.

3281
03:23:13,010 --> 03:23:13,410
Hind.

3282
03:23:15,570 --> 03:23:16,850
Uh, what about Deep Throat?

3283
03:23:17,310 --> 03:23:18,330
I know he's not going to say anything.

3284
03:23:18,570 --> 03:23:19,290
The guy's shy.

3285
03:23:20,810 --> 03:23:21,750
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

3286
03:23:22,530 --> 03:23:23,830
Liquid is still hovering.

3287
03:23:24,850 --> 03:23:25,410
Yeah, yeah.

3288
03:23:25,590 --> 03:23:26,010
Hold on.

3289
03:23:26,310 --> 03:23:26,630
Mailing.

3290
03:23:26,910 --> 03:23:27,310
There we go.

3291
03:23:28,770 --> 03:23:29,350
What's up, Snake?

3292
03:23:29,710 --> 03:23:33,510
You can buy fire department elevator override keys on eBay?

3293
03:23:34,750 --> 03:23:35,270
What?

3294
03:23:36,350 --> 03:23:37,990
What does that, what would that do?

3295
03:23:38,670 --> 03:23:39,270
What does that do?

3296
03:23:39,690 --> 03:23:43,230
Does it just make you able to use the elevator however you
want?

3297
03:23:45,270 --> 03:23:51,350
In China, they say, once the fox gets his nose in, he'll
soon find a way to make his body follow.

3298
03:23:52,530 --> 03:24:03,470
description of you you can do it snake but you've got to be
flexible adapt to each situation uniquely okay all right I'm

3301
03:24:29,840 --> 03:24:33,000
Is he, like, chilling around in here?

3302
03:24:34,900 --> 03:24:36,560
I mean, there's nowhere for him to go.

3303
03:24:37,500 --> 03:24:37,740
Right?

3304
03:24:39,580 --> 03:24:40,060
Like...

3305
03:24:42,580 --> 03:24:44,620
He's using Stealth Camel.

3306
03:24:45,440 --> 03:24:48,060
Yeah, but I mean, it's not, like, the best.

3307
03:24:49,160 --> 03:24:50,120
Thermal goggles?

3308
03:24:50,880 --> 03:24:52,020
I don't have thermal.

3309
03:24:52,140 --> 03:24:52,960
I only had night vision.

3310
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:55,160
Oh, my eyes.

3311
03:24:55,640 --> 03:24:56,040
Ugh.

3312
03:24:56,420 --> 03:24:57,440
Okay, never mind.

3313
03:24:58,160 --> 03:24:58,740
Okay, let's go.

3314
03:25:01,040 --> 03:25:01,900
Let's go!

3315
03:25:02,140 --> 03:25:05,120
Oh, I should have used the body armor for the stairs.

3316
03:25:05,720 --> 03:25:06,780
That's okay, though.

3317
03:25:08,600 --> 03:25:09,200
Ikimashou.

3318
03:25:13,570 --> 03:25:15,810
Yeah, I don't even have the thermal goggles.

3319
03:25:17,890 --> 03:25:18,150
What the?

3320
03:25:18,330 --> 03:25:18,710
Oh!

3321
03:25:19,130 --> 03:25:19,230
Oh!

3322
03:25:21,650 --> 03:25:22,890
Oh my gosh.

3323
03:25:24,790 --> 03:25:25,850
You jerky!

3324
03:25:26,370 --> 03:25:26,390
Okay.

3325
03:25:37,720 --> 03:25:42,000
Gosh, okay, this is where I have to start looking out for
the...

3326
03:25:43,760 --> 03:25:44,720
For the...

3327
03:25:44,720 --> 03:25:45,540
Cameras.

3328
03:25:48,160 --> 03:25:50,220
I didn't know what MGS was moved to today.

3329
03:25:50,400 --> 03:25:51,540
I'm sorry!

3330
03:25:51,920 --> 03:25:58,980
Yeah, like, some of my plans got moved around last minute.

3331
03:26:00,180 --> 03:26:03,380
I'm so sorry, I tried to announce it in several places.

3332
03:26:04,100 --> 03:26:05,600
I put the waiting room up earlier.

3333
03:26:06,260 --> 03:26:06,940
It's okay though.

3334
03:26:09,580 --> 03:26:14,420
Honestly, a lot of it was me trying to get the dang PSG so
far.

3335
03:26:17,180 --> 03:26:17,980
There we go.

3336
03:26:20,990 --> 03:26:22,310
Oh, a little too high.

3337
03:26:23,990 --> 03:26:24,130
Hello?

3338
03:26:25,370 --> 03:26:26,890
I feel like that should have hit it.

3339
03:26:27,110 --> 03:26:27,470
There we go.

3340
03:26:27,550 --> 03:26:27,710
Okay.

3341
03:26:29,850 --> 03:26:32,690
My last Oshi blasted off into space on a rocket ship.

3342
03:26:32,890 --> 03:26:34,130
Whoa, that sounds awesome.

3343
03:26:34,670 --> 03:26:36,070
She also used to stream MGS.

3344
03:26:36,230 --> 03:26:36,970
Thanks for the stream.

3345
03:26:37,490 --> 03:26:38,270
Of course.

3346
03:26:38,270 --> 03:26:41,990
You know, I could be your new Oshi if you wanted.

3347
03:26:42,590 --> 03:26:43,230
Just saying.

3348
03:26:43,430 --> 03:26:45,030
You know, no pressure or anything.

3349
03:26:45,610 --> 03:26:47,310
I also play MGS.

3350
03:26:49,210 --> 03:26:50,170
And, um...

3351
03:26:50,170 --> 03:26:53,830
I have no reason to go to space, so...

3352
03:26:55,010 --> 03:26:55,990
I'm just saying.

3353
03:27:00,610 --> 03:27:01,090
Oh!

3354
03:27:03,150 --> 03:27:04,350
Sneaky, snarky.

3355
03:27:13,600 --> 03:27:15,220
I can't ever get this one.

3356
03:27:15,500 --> 03:27:15,920
properly.

3357
03:27:16,720 --> 03:27:16,920
Hey!

3358
03:27:17,460 --> 03:27:17,940
Here we go.

3359
03:27:20,340 --> 03:27:21,700
You're my new Osi.

3360
03:27:22,880 --> 03:27:23,180
Wow.

3361
03:27:23,460 --> 03:27:24,360
Where's your sense of loyalty?

3362
03:27:25,780 --> 03:27:26,760
No, just kidding.

3363
03:27:27,920 --> 03:27:29,780
You threw away your old Osi that fast?

3364
03:27:30,380 --> 03:27:31,540
Where is your sense of loyalty?

3365
03:27:32,220 --> 03:27:33,400
I'm just kidding.

3366
03:27:35,680 --> 03:27:37,520
Amazing how much easier this part is.

3367
03:27:37,680 --> 03:27:38,200
I know, right?

3368
03:27:38,240 --> 03:27:40,840
It's actually it feels unfair a little bit.

3369
03:27:44,080 --> 03:27:44,840
Oh my gosh!

3370
03:27:45,840 --> 03:27:46,720
So goofy.

3371
03:27:47,500 --> 03:27:48,620
It's so funny, though.

3372
03:28:00,400 --> 03:28:01,140
There we go.

3373
03:28:04,480 --> 03:28:04,920
Nice.

3374
03:28:06,620 --> 03:28:08,060
We had to move on.

3375
03:28:09,000 --> 03:28:10,040
Yeah, I get it.

3376
03:28:13,600 --> 03:28:14,740
I do get it.

3377
03:28:15,040 --> 03:28:21,200
But if I found someone very similar to my Oshi, even if it
was like a similar voice and everything, I'd be like, I

3378
03:28:21,200 --> 03:28:22,940
probably would also be like, okay, you know what?

3379
03:28:25,980 --> 03:28:27,040
I get it.

3380
03:28:28,880 --> 03:28:32,380
Okay, I'd probably also move on.

3381
03:28:35,420 --> 03:28:35,980
Famous.

3382
03:28:42,770 --> 03:28:43,330
Nice.

3383
03:28:46,350 --> 03:28:49,830
Health is good enough.

3384
03:28:52,050 --> 03:28:54,070
I won't grab that ration.

3385
03:28:54,350 --> 03:28:56,170
Well, actually, I don't think I could come back here.

3386
03:28:56,730 --> 03:28:58,510
So you know what, we will just top off.

3387
03:28:59,230 --> 03:28:59,510
Choo!

3388
03:29:01,670 --> 03:29:03,490
Oshi or your loyalty to Minto.

3389
03:29:09,800 --> 03:29:11,080
Don't make me choose.

3390
03:29:11,920 --> 03:29:12,560
Where's the door?

3391
03:29:13,640 --> 03:29:13,820
Huh?

3392
03:29:15,680 --> 03:29:16,940
Oh, oh, here it is.

3393
03:29:19,100 --> 03:29:20,020
Here we go.

3394
03:29:20,940 --> 03:29:22,620
I noticed the ladder this time.

3395
03:29:22,780 --> 03:29:23,260
I noticed.

3396
03:29:36,590 --> 03:29:37,130
Oh.

3397
03:29:38,030 --> 03:29:38,590
Okay.

3398
03:29:39,290 --> 03:29:41,370
Have I told you lately that you're truly awful?

3399
03:29:41,830 --> 03:29:42,390
Really?

3400
03:29:42,810 --> 03:29:43,150
Really?

3401
03:29:44,650 --> 03:29:45,090
Me?

3402
03:29:45,490 --> 03:29:46,670
I'm the bad one.

3403
03:29:48,230 --> 03:29:48,490
Me?

3404
03:29:49,730 --> 03:29:50,330
Mm-hmm.

3405
03:29:52,870 --> 03:29:53,310
Sorry.

3406
03:29:53,970 --> 03:29:55,650
Only unshowered people are my Oshi.

3407
03:29:55,890 --> 03:29:56,850
Goodbye forever, Minto.

3408
03:29:58,410 --> 03:30:00,430
How do you know I didn't shower today, huh?

3409
03:30:02,190 --> 03:30:06,650
When will we get to see a made-Mint live reaction to Ocelot
kissing snake?

3410
03:30:08,450 --> 03:30:09,150
I don't know.

3411
03:30:09,270 --> 03:30:10,030
Oh, don't forget to save.

3412
03:30:10,150 --> 03:30:10,670
Yeah, thank you.

3413
03:30:11,190 --> 03:30:11,550
I don't know.

3414
03:30:11,950 --> 03:30:12,930
Maybe sooner than you think.

3415
03:30:13,170 --> 03:30:22,410
knows what can i do for you snake yeah i really don't want
to have to go through shooting all those guys all those

3416
03:30:22,410 --> 03:30:28,030
again though usually it's pretty good about like just
sending me back but you know what if something happens to

3417
03:30:28,030 --> 03:30:36,070
the disc who knows he who is firm in will molds the world to
himself don't forget what you're here to do you've got to

3418
03:30:36,070 --> 03:30:43,570

3420
03:30:49,470 --> 03:30:50,470
He's waiting for you.

3421
03:30:50,470 --> 03:30:51,370
He's waiting for me.

3422
03:30:51,670 --> 03:30:54,110
Snake It's time for you to take him on.

3423
03:30:54,390 --> 03:30:54,850
Woohoo

3424
03:30:59,540 --> 03:31:02,320
I'll repair the elevator while you're fighting that hind.

3425
03:31:02,940 --> 03:31:04,800
It might take some time, so don't hurry.

3426
03:31:05,400 --> 03:31:14,920
Okay I'll take my time Oh wait, oh, I should switch to the
body armor Seize the moment.

3427
03:31:16,180 --> 03:31:18,800
Bum, bum.

3428
03:31:20,980 --> 03:31:21,300
Brother!

3429
03:31:24,980 --> 03:31:28,160
So, the snakes finally come out of his home.

3430
03:31:29,020 --> 03:31:30,140
Are you ready now?

3431
03:31:30,560 --> 03:31:31,500
My brother.

3432
03:31:32,040 --> 03:31:33,600
Why are you calling me brother?

3433
03:31:34,060 --> 03:31:35,000
Who the hell are you?

3434
03:31:35,000 --> 03:31:36,040
He explained it.

3435
03:31:36,560 --> 03:31:37,420
I'm you.

3436
03:31:38,000 --> 03:31:39,440
I'm your shadow.

3437
03:31:40,960 --> 03:31:42,000
I'm a sight...

3438
03:31:45,460 --> 03:31:46,160
What?

3439
03:31:46,360 --> 03:31:48,600
I'll send you to hell to meet him!

3440
03:31:53,340 --> 03:31:56,860
A cat is so...

3441
03:31:56,860 --> 03:31:57,180
What?

3442
03:31:58,060 --> 03:31:59,280
Standing man emoji.

3443
03:32:01,100 --> 03:32:01,420
Okay.

3444
03:32:02,560 --> 03:32:03,360
All right.

3445
03:32:03,620 --> 03:32:04,760
Okay, so we can see him.

3446
03:32:05,660 --> 03:32:06,120
There.

3447
03:32:06,340 --> 03:32:08,560
Where's our... stinger?

3448
03:32:15,090 --> 03:32:16,050
What is he?

3449
03:32:16,190 --> 03:32:16,370
Oh.

3450
03:32:16,390 --> 03:32:17,910
Whoa, whoa, he's fast.

3451
03:32:20,270 --> 03:32:20,290
Hey!

3452
03:32:20,890 --> 03:32:21,730
I don't know if that'll work.

3453
03:32:23,350 --> 03:32:24,090
Oh, I guess it did work.

3454
03:32:26,150 --> 03:32:28,030
Oh my gosh, it's so fast!

3455
03:32:28,910 --> 03:32:30,290
How is it so fast?

3456
03:32:31,050 --> 03:32:31,190
Oh.

3457
03:32:43,680 --> 03:32:44,900
He's so fast.

3458
03:32:45,960 --> 03:32:47,080
Maybe he'll come around this way.

3459
03:32:48,520 --> 03:32:49,020
Oh, there he is.

3460
03:32:50,020 --> 03:32:50,340
Ouch.

3461
03:32:51,640 --> 03:32:52,500
He's taking a lot of hits.

3462
03:32:53,500 --> 03:32:53,860
Ah!

3463
03:32:54,960 --> 03:32:56,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3464
03:32:56,780 --> 03:32:57,280
Oh my gosh.

3465
03:33:00,780 --> 03:33:03,320
Just posting a bullet, it's nice.

3466
03:33:05,040 --> 03:33:05,600
Oh!

3467
03:33:06,300 --> 03:33:06,900
Where is he?

3468
03:33:07,180 --> 03:33:07,860
Where'd he go?

3469
03:33:09,080 --> 03:33:13,380
I don't think I got him.

3470
03:33:14,860 --> 03:33:15,420
Ouch!

3471
03:33:20,780 --> 03:33:21,580
Oh my god.

3472
03:33:22,120 --> 03:33:24,080
He doesn't hit me as easily though.

3473
03:33:28,280 --> 03:33:30,560
Oh, oh, oh, ouch, ouch.

3474
03:33:48,380 --> 03:33:49,660
I don't know if that'll work.

3475
03:33:52,000 --> 03:33:54,580
Are you telling me I had a bad shot?

3476
03:33:55,040 --> 03:33:55,880
Over here?

3477
03:33:56,140 --> 03:33:56,800
Over here?

3478
03:33:57,800 --> 03:33:58,100
Aye!

3479
03:34:00,100 --> 03:34:01,020
Oh, oh!

3480
03:34:06,290 --> 03:34:07,490
Where am I supposed to go?

3481
03:34:08,730 --> 03:34:09,010
Oh.

3482
03:34:09,970 --> 03:34:10,550
That's it?

3483
03:34:10,850 --> 03:34:11,550
That's all you got?

3484
03:34:12,930 --> 03:34:14,050
That's all you've got?

3485
03:34:14,570 --> 03:34:14,890
Liquid?

3486
03:34:21,990 --> 03:34:23,710
Oh, is he doing the down low thing?

3487
03:34:29,650 --> 03:34:30,010
No!

3488
03:34:30,210 --> 03:34:30,290
Ow!

3489
03:34:30,450 --> 03:34:30,450
Ow!

3490
03:34:30,650 --> 03:34:31,110
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

3491
03:34:33,730 --> 03:34:34,450
Like, weird.

3492
03:34:44,230 --> 03:34:46,470
You can't tell when he's down low, because...

3493
03:34:47,270 --> 03:34:47,450
Oh!

3494
03:34:50,250 --> 03:34:52,330
Before, it would, like, do an actual...

3495
03:34:52,330 --> 03:34:54,430
Like, the music would get so quiet, you know?

3496
03:34:55,990 --> 03:34:57,210
I'm not sure where is he.

3497
03:34:59,370 --> 03:35:00,090
So fast.

3498
03:35:03,670 --> 03:35:04,030
Ouch!

3499
03:35:06,510 --> 03:35:08,330
Oh, yeah, I got, I hit you.

3500
03:35:08,470 --> 03:35:10,170
And it was a nice shot, actually.

3501
03:35:11,190 --> 03:35:12,730
Gosh, this fight is so much easier.

3502
03:35:25,920 --> 03:35:27,980
Oh, my God, you're so loud, please.

3503
03:35:36,590 --> 03:35:36,990
It

3504
03:35:47,770 --> 03:35:49,410
does get a little bit quieter.

3505
03:35:50,910 --> 03:35:51,670
Where the heck is he?

3506
03:35:52,190 --> 03:35:52,610
This side?

3507
03:35:53,390 --> 03:35:53,630
Yeah.

3508
03:36:01,130 --> 03:36:02,050
I lost you.

3509
03:36:02,350 --> 03:36:02,990
Where are you?

3510
03:36:04,670 --> 03:36:05,370
Wait, where?

3511
03:36:05,430 --> 03:36:08,090
Ah, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3512
03:36:08,110 --> 03:36:10,450
I keep losing you!

3513
03:36:11,150 --> 03:36:14,710
I keep losing you, Liquid!

3514
03:36:14,970 --> 03:36:15,050
I keep losing you, Liquid!

3515
03:36:15,050 --> 03:36:16,230
You come here first!

3516
03:36:17,770 --> 03:36:18,970
You come here first!

3517
03:36:31,200 --> 03:36:33,560
Um, skill issue perhaps?

3518
03:36:34,220 --> 03:36:34,520
Liquid?

3519
03:36:35,160 --> 03:36:35,640
Oh my god.

3520
03:36:47,980 --> 03:36:49,920
There's the space of junk!

3521
03:36:52,300 --> 03:36:53,600
Where the heck are you?

3522
03:36:54,140 --> 03:36:58,090
Oh my gosh.

3523
03:37:01,320 --> 03:37:02,360
That's so loud.

3524
03:37:11,720 --> 03:37:12,820
Maybe he'll come over this.

3525
03:37:18,530 --> 03:37:18,830
Woo!

3526
03:37:19,530 --> 03:37:19,770
Woo!

3527
03:37:22,470 --> 03:37:23,990
How did I avoid that?

3528
03:37:29,510 --> 03:37:30,370
Hey, this!

3529
03:37:53,940 --> 03:37:54,900
Almost there.

3530
03:38:09,790 --> 03:38:10,750
They did this in the original...

3531
03:38:10,750 --> 03:38:11,330
Oh, never mind.

3532
03:38:16,400 --> 03:38:18,020
Where did you...

3533
03:38:18,020 --> 03:38:18,360
What?

3534
03:38:27,040 --> 03:38:29,060
There's the hellfire.

3535
03:38:30,920 --> 03:38:32,120
Oh, here it is.

3536
03:38:32,580 --> 03:38:33,600
The best part.

3537
03:38:34,220 --> 03:38:34,540
Go Snake!

3538
03:38:41,830 --> 03:38:42,930
Yeah!

3539
03:38:46,730 --> 03:38:47,770
Yeah!

3540
03:38:56,940 --> 03:38:58,180
Good

3541
03:39:03,290 --> 03:39:05,550
thing we got that body armor on.

3542
03:39:19,480 --> 03:39:20,440
Liquid!

3543
03:39:23,740 --> 03:39:25,360
See you in hell, liquid.

3544
03:39:26,040 --> 03:39:26,240
Yeah!

3545
03:39:28,980 --> 03:39:30,520
Absolute cinema.

3546
03:39:31,360 --> 03:39:32,940
Explosions in the background.

3547
03:39:33,760 --> 03:39:34,200
Yeah!

3548
03:39:36,180 --> 03:39:36,840
Yeah!

3549
03:39:37,320 --> 03:39:38,640
That's my action here.

3550
03:39:38,960 --> 03:39:39,200
Yeah!

3551
03:39:47,670 --> 03:39:49,990
Snake, the elevator's working.

3552
03:39:50,590 --> 03:39:51,330
You've fixed it?

3553
03:39:52,010 --> 03:39:53,390
No, that's the weird thing.

3554
03:39:53,770 --> 03:39:55,090
It just moved by itself.

3555
03:39:55,990 --> 03:39:57,150
It's headed your way now.

3556
03:39:57,610 --> 03:39:58,150
Is that so?

3557
03:39:58,790 --> 03:39:59,630
So, Nino.

3558
03:40:00,730 --> 03:40:02,290
That explosion before.

3559
03:40:02,490 --> 03:40:03,050
What was it?

3560
03:40:03,470 --> 03:40:05,690
Oh, I had to take out that helicopter.

3561
03:40:06,910 --> 03:40:07,410
Helicopter?

3562
03:40:08,470 --> 03:40:09,810
That's incredible, Snake.

3563
03:40:09,890 --> 03:40:11,250
You knew I was going up there.

3564
03:40:11,390 --> 03:40:12,790
I just want to make sure again.

3565
03:40:13,310 --> 03:40:15,270
I cannot hate this ever.

3566
03:40:15,610 --> 03:40:16,750
I know it's so awesome.

3567
03:40:16,850 --> 03:40:21,990
The entrance to the underground maintenance base is towards
the back of the snowfield ahead.

3568
03:40:23,670 --> 03:40:25,490
Find a safe place to hide out for a while.

3569
03:40:26,130 --> 03:40:27,050
I'm going underground.

3570
03:40:27,730 --> 03:40:28,650
I know, I know.

3571
03:40:28,890 --> 03:40:29,830
You don't have to tell me.

3572
03:40:30,390 --> 03:40:31,670
And stay out of my way.

3573
03:40:32,150 --> 03:40:34,010
Don't try to be a hero or anything.

3574
03:40:35,590 --> 03:40:36,770
Call me if you need to.

3575
03:40:37,750 --> 03:40:38,530
All right.

3576
03:40:40,650 --> 03:40:41,670
Let's brag to Miller.

3577
03:40:41,790 --> 03:40:43,370
Oh my god, Master Miller is going to be really proud.

3578
03:40:43,470 --> 03:40:44,970
He's going to be like, you took...

3579
03:40:44,970 --> 03:40:46,530
Sorry, I was really...

3580
03:40:46,530 --> 03:40:48,970
I had some, you know, I had some Taco Bell earlier.

3581
03:40:49,390 --> 03:40:52,190
I just, I just couldn't, you know, I just didn't want you to
hear that.

3582
03:40:53,250 --> 03:40:55,350
Snake jumping off a missile is canon to me.

3583
03:40:55,430 --> 03:40:56,170
Me too.

3584
03:40:58,350 --> 03:40:59,070
Where are we?

3585
03:40:59,090 --> 03:41:03,330
Also, are we not going to talk about Snake jumping off that
missile like Mario jumped off a bullet bill?

3586
03:41:03,670 --> 03:41:04,970
We are going to talk about it.

3587
03:41:05,030 --> 03:41:06,070
It was awesome!

3588
03:41:06,730 --> 03:41:08,330
Oh, he's probably still busy, you know.

3589
03:41:08,730 --> 03:41:09,070
It's okay.

3590
03:41:09,250 --> 03:41:09,990
I get it.

3591
03:41:10,870 --> 03:41:11,810
Did you see that?

3592
03:41:11,950 --> 03:41:12,590
Did you see that, Colonel?

3593
03:41:12,690 --> 03:41:13,330
You did it, Snake.

3594
03:41:13,770 --> 03:41:14,910
You shot down the hind.

3595
03:41:15,010 --> 03:41:15,450
I know.

3596
03:41:15,450 --> 03:41:16,310
I was so worried.

3597
03:41:16,830 --> 03:41:24,170
Liquid couldn't have survived that I wonder But even so Just
because we've taken out their leader Doesn't mean they're

3598
03:41:24,170 --> 03:41:30,450
going to give up They're still going to try to launch that
nuke You're right Dedication is so real Hope you're doing

3599
03:41:30,450 --> 03:41:36,290
all today, Mint You do none The underground base is past the
communications tower The elevator is working again, isn't

3600
03:41:36,290 --> 03:41:36,630
it?

3601
03:41:37,270 --> 03:41:44,430
I'm glad that you love Um Uh Ace combat Probably as much as
I love Metal Gear But be careful Don't waste your whole

3602
03:41:44,430 --> 03:41:47,590
paycheck, you know Stay on the ground.

3603
03:41:49,070 --> 03:41:53,990
If you stop by a burger place while looking for food, maybe
you'll run into why Miller couldn't help with that Hein D.

3604
03:41:54,530 --> 03:41:57,390
Oh, he was taking care of his food chain.

3605
03:41:57,510 --> 03:41:58,210
You're so right.

3606
03:41:59,850 --> 03:42:00,250
Oh, wait.

3607
03:42:00,910 --> 03:42:04,190
I don't know why, but the elevator just started working
again.

3608
03:42:04,850 --> 03:42:10,010
If you take it all the way to the bottom of Tower B and go
outside, you'll be in the snowfield.

3609
03:42:10,790 --> 03:42:11,190
The snowfield.

3610
03:42:11,450 --> 03:42:14,490
The underground maintenance base is in the north of the
snowfield.

3611
03:42:14,630 --> 03:42:16,510
I was in the kitchen making a snack.

3612
03:42:16,530 --> 03:42:20,550
and I could hear your cheers from my headphones peeking out
from my room.

3613
03:42:20,550 --> 03:42:21,050
Sorry.

3614
03:42:22,290 --> 03:42:23,790
Sorry that I'm loud.

3615
03:42:24,930 --> 03:42:27,030
Sorry that I'm a little loud sometimes.

3616
03:42:27,510 --> 03:42:29,350
But you can't blame me, right?

3617
03:42:29,910 --> 03:42:30,610
For cheering.

3618
03:42:31,730 --> 03:42:33,010
There's nothing else here?

3619
03:42:35,050 --> 03:42:36,670
There really isn't...

3620
03:42:36,670 --> 03:42:36,830
Whoa.

3621
03:42:38,650 --> 03:42:39,710
I thought I saw something.

3622
03:42:39,970 --> 03:42:40,110
Oh.

3623
03:42:41,370 --> 03:42:46,430
Oh, I was seeing the stuff landing on my camera.

3624
03:42:48,490 --> 03:42:49,950
Oh, okay.

3625
03:42:50,730 --> 03:42:52,050
Let's go take the elevator.

3626
03:42:56,490 --> 03:42:58,530
Here, I'll turn my mic down just a little bit.

3627
03:43:02,210 --> 03:43:02,510
Goop.

3628
03:43:02,970 --> 03:43:03,870
There we go.

3629
03:43:05,030 --> 03:43:06,210
And down we go.

3630
03:43:09,450 --> 03:43:11,770
Had to go attend to some burgers on the stove.

3631
03:43:14,310 --> 03:43:15,270
That guy.

3632
03:43:17,350 --> 03:43:18,990
He's in Burger Town, real.

3633
03:43:22,490 --> 03:43:26,050
Why would they give us fam- Oh, maybe if you use the famus
on the...

3634
03:43:28,470 --> 03:43:30,050
If you use the famus on the...

3635
03:43:30,610 --> 03:43:31,070
What's the word?

3636
03:43:32,690 --> 03:43:33,570
Oh my goodness.

3637
03:43:34,410 --> 03:43:34,970
The cameras.

3638
03:43:35,970 --> 03:43:37,470
No, be louder, please.

3639
03:43:41,350 --> 03:43:45,830
I didn't notice that my mic was sounding a little bit weird
recently.

3640
03:43:46,270 --> 03:43:47,030
Maybe it's just me?

3641
03:43:47,210 --> 03:43:47,630
I don't know.

3642
03:43:53,330 --> 03:43:58,290
I'll work around, I'll work on it, I'll see what's going on
with it.

3643
03:44:03,550 --> 03:44:04,890
They're all still down, right?

3644
03:44:05,790 --> 03:44:07,130
Yeah, they're not moving, Ernie.

3645
03:44:07,290 --> 03:44:09,530
I mean, they weren't moving before, but...

3646
03:44:10,110 --> 03:44:11,170
Yeah, they're all pointed.

3647
03:44:11,310 --> 03:44:13,050
Yeah, we're good, we're good.

3648
03:44:16,090 --> 03:44:17,690
I'm actually kind of low, really.

3649
03:44:18,050 --> 03:44:18,570
Oh, okay.

3650
03:44:19,870 --> 03:44:21,470
Like, I have my compressor on and everything.

3651
03:44:25,530 --> 03:44:27,250
It just gets so energetic, you guys, I'm sorry.

3652
03:44:29,030 --> 03:44:30,050
I haven't noticed, really.

3653
03:44:30,570 --> 03:44:31,250
That's good.

3654
03:44:33,190 --> 03:44:33,470
That's good.

3655
03:44:33,470 --> 03:44:33,810
Sounds good.

3656
03:44:36,150 --> 03:44:38,750
That's good.

3657
03:44:40,570 --> 03:44:41,610
That's good.

3658
03:44:41,610 --> 03:44:42,810
Make sounds fine.

3659
03:44:45,530 --> 03:44:45,930
That is good.

3660
03:44:48,630 --> 03:44:53,470
I feel with how much you love these action cutscenes, you
would love the Devil May Cry games.

3661
03:44:54,670 --> 03:44:55,350
I believe you.

3662
03:44:57,090 --> 03:44:59,150
I do love over-the-top action.

3663
03:45:00,450 --> 03:45:02,130
It's so fun.

3664
03:45:05,690 --> 03:45:06,350
Okay.

3665
03:45:11,550 --> 03:45:13,790
I love my communications tower ASMR.

3666
03:45:14,550 --> 03:45:15,150
What's this?

3667
03:45:15,770 --> 03:45:16,090
Grenade.

3668
03:45:16,710 --> 03:45:17,210
Oh, nice.

3669
03:45:18,030 --> 03:45:18,930
Yeah, we'll take those.

3670
03:45:20,130 --> 03:45:22,070
And here we use the FAMIS.

3671
03:45:23,530 --> 03:45:25,070
We gotta get ready.

3672
03:45:26,390 --> 03:45:28,290
Oh, there's a ration right there.

3673
03:45:28,630 --> 03:45:30,550
Oh, I never noticed.

3674
03:45:30,570 --> 03:45:32,870
Oh, wow.

3675
03:45:40,280 --> 03:45:41,580
Push the button.

3676
03:45:43,600 --> 03:45:45,220
That's why we have Metal Gear Rising.

3677
03:45:45,600 --> 03:45:46,140
So true.

3678
03:45:47,300 --> 03:45:48,100
Don't forget food tile.

3679
03:45:48,240 --> 03:45:48,780
I don't know.

3680
03:45:50,520 --> 03:45:50,760
Huh?

3681
03:45:55,820 --> 03:45:56,040
Huh?

3682
03:45:59,830 --> 03:46:00,250
Hmm.

3683
03:46:00,810 --> 03:46:02,610
I hope I don't run into anyone in here.

3684
03:46:03,090 --> 03:46:03,170
Oh.

3685
03:46:03,770 --> 03:46:04,350
Uh.

3686
03:46:05,470 --> 03:46:06,290
There we go.

3687
03:46:07,410 --> 03:46:08,990
It's working though!

3688
03:46:11,210 --> 03:46:12,210
Oh my gosh, this is it.

3689
03:46:12,370 --> 03:46:13,950
This is the codec call.

3690
03:46:14,430 --> 03:46:16,810
Snake, there's something I forgot to tell you before.

3691
03:46:18,050 --> 03:46:21,570
There were five stealth camouflage prototypes in my lab.

3692
03:46:21,970 --> 03:46:22,730
Yeah, so?

3693
03:46:23,030 --> 03:46:26,150
If you take out the one I'm wearing, that leaves four.

3694
03:46:26,550 --> 03:46:29,090
Hey, this isn't first grade math class.

3695
03:46:29,530 --> 03:46:32,710
I thought I'd get one for you, so I went back to the lab
and...

3696
03:46:32,710 --> 03:46:33,090
And?

3697
03:46:33,710 --> 03:46:35,370
The four suits were missing.

3698
03:46:37,550 --> 03:46:45,750
also about the elevator that I checked out it's really
strange it was like someone was intentionally holding it

3699
03:46:45,750 --> 03:46:52,570
when you were riding on it did the weight limit warning go
off that's another thing that bothered me about it yeah the

3700
03:46:52,570 --> 03:47:02,790
warning went off and I know I couldn't be over the limit are
you sure about 135 whoa he's tiny skinny baby 650 pounds it

3701
03:47:02,790 --> 03:47:10,790
would take at least five people to The guys who stole my
stealth prototypes are in there with you.

3702
03:47:10,830 --> 03:47:12,350
Oh my god!

3703
03:47:13,050 --> 03:47:14,190
No way!

3704
03:47:14,570 --> 03:47:16,510
Oh my god.

3705
03:47:19,050 --> 03:47:20,750
I can't believe they're in here with us.

3706
03:47:23,210 --> 03:47:24,250
Oh, oh.

3707
03:47:26,690 --> 03:47:27,810
I can also shoot.

3708
03:47:29,870 --> 03:47:30,070
Shoot.

3709
03:47:30,690 --> 03:47:32,410
Oh my god, that's spin.

3710
03:47:43,290 --> 03:47:43,890
Okay.

3711
03:47:51,370 --> 03:47:52,770
So true, Snake.

3712
03:47:54,090 --> 03:47:57,870
They were chumps.

3713
03:47:58,350 --> 03:47:58,890
They were.

3714
03:48:07,260 --> 03:48:07,520
Nice.

3715
03:48:11,610 --> 03:48:14,070
I hear a...

3716
03:48:14,850 --> 03:48:16,250
I hear a camera.

3717
03:48:22,320 --> 03:48:22,660
In here?

3718
03:48:22,960 --> 03:48:22,960
Maybe.

3719
03:48:29,990 --> 03:48:30,210
Oh!

3720
03:48:30,690 --> 03:48:31,110
What was that?

3721
03:48:36,560 --> 03:48:37,700
What was that over here?

3722
03:48:38,700 --> 03:48:41,480
I guess I should collect everything first, though.

3723
03:48:41,540 --> 03:48:41,700
Oh,

3724
03:48:47,760 --> 03:48:50,200
the PSG tranquilizer version.

3725
03:48:51,360 --> 03:48:52,900
The tranquilizer one.

3726
03:48:55,990 --> 03:48:56,930
PSG bullets.

3727
03:48:57,810 --> 03:48:59,490
Oh, it's this one right here.

3728
03:48:59,770 --> 03:49:00,210
Wait, hold on.

3729
03:49:00,290 --> 03:49:01,630
Maybe I can get it from here.

3730
03:49:03,350 --> 03:49:03,890
Oh, there it is.

3731
03:49:03,970 --> 03:49:04,110
Yeah.

3732
03:49:08,430 --> 03:49:09,470
That's right.

3733
03:49:10,150 --> 03:49:11,370
That's right, buddy.

3734
03:49:11,490 --> 03:49:12,390
That's right.

3735
03:49:12,730 --> 03:49:13,150
That's right.

3736
03:49:19,960 --> 03:49:22,280
Try again, idiot.

3737
03:49:23,300 --> 03:49:23,840
Actually, don't.

3738
03:49:24,220 --> 03:49:25,220
Let me go.

3739
03:49:25,580 --> 03:49:26,520
I just want to live.

3740
03:49:27,980 --> 03:49:29,180
I just want to go.

3741
03:49:50,840 --> 03:49:51,740
Another one, right?

3742
03:49:51,900 --> 03:49:52,480
Oh, we're good.

3743
03:49:54,260 --> 03:49:55,220
Too late for it.

3744
03:49:56,180 --> 03:49:57,500
Oh, I thought it was cold medicine.

3745
03:49:59,260 --> 03:50:00,380
I thought it was cold medicine.

3746
03:50:00,740 --> 03:50:02,080
Okay, when the door opens...

3747
03:50:02,080 --> 03:50:04,900
Okay, one of my biggest issues...

3748
03:50:04,900 --> 03:50:05,680
Not one of my biggest.

3749
03:50:05,700 --> 03:50:10,440
it's not the biggest but it's an issue that i really have
with specifically the fight with sniper wolf and the

3750
03:50:10,440 --> 03:50:17,820
cutscene afterwards in the original the the sky and
everything looks like this it looks cold it looks dark it

3751
03:50:17,820 --> 03:50:24,480
looks like bleak everything and like watching snake walk
into the darkness after the fight is like one of the it's

3752
03:50:24,480 --> 03:50:32,860
like one of the coldest things i've ever seen ever it's so
awesome but but this they make it so much brighter but this

3753
03:50:32,860 --> 03:50:37,040
looks like how it does in the original What game is that?

3754
03:50:37,220 --> 03:50:38,460
The original Metal Gear Solid.

3755
03:50:39,660 --> 03:50:40,580
The original, the original.

3756
03:50:43,240 --> 03:50:43,840
Um...

3757
03:50:43,840 --> 03:50:46,040
Does anyone have to say anything before we continue?

3758
03:50:46,460 --> 03:50:51,840
The entrance to the underground maintenance base is
somewhere towards the back of the snowfield north of Tower

3759
03:50:51,840 --> 03:50:52,120
B.

3760
03:50:52,360 --> 03:50:52,680
Okay.

3761
03:50:53,220 --> 03:50:54,240
Thank you.

3762
03:50:54,920 --> 03:50:56,660
Otacon, I'm alive, by the way.

3763
03:50:56,980 --> 03:50:59,780
Otacon, which direction is the underground base?

3764
03:51:00,380 --> 03:51:02,020
It's in the snowfield to the north of Tower B.

3765
03:51:03,000 --> 03:51:03,680
Oh, so awesome.

3766
03:51:03,800 --> 03:51:05,240
The door is security level 6.

3767
03:51:06,800 --> 03:51:08,120
It's so awesome.

3768
03:51:08,620 --> 03:51:09,180
Like, I don't know.

3769
03:51:09,320 --> 03:51:11,600
It just, like, creates the atmosphere so well.

3770
03:51:11,720 --> 03:51:14,000
Especially when Otakon is, like, yelling out to him.

3771
03:51:14,080 --> 03:51:16,560
And he's like, what are you fighting for?

3772
03:51:17,120 --> 03:51:19,200
It's, oh, it just hits different.

3773
03:51:20,120 --> 03:51:21,660
Nostasha, what do you have to say about that?

3774
03:51:22,180 --> 03:51:28,540
As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues,
nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be

3775
03:51:28,540 --> 03:51:29,060
eliminated.

3776
03:51:30,140 --> 03:51:35,680
If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much
without elimination as the ultimate goal.

3777
03:51:35,700 --> 03:51:38,400
I used to work in the DIA.

3778
03:51:39,340 --> 03:51:46,540
I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination was to
work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness

3779
03:51:46,540 --> 03:51:47,920
of the deterrence theory.

3780
03:51:51,440 --> 03:51:55,200
Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see.

3781
03:51:56,020 --> 03:51:57,540
And I have seen a lot of it.

3782
03:51:58,720 --> 03:52:00,560
I have seen more than enough of it.

3783
03:52:02,340 --> 03:52:05,260
I was born and raised in Pripyat, Ukraine.

3784
03:52:05,700 --> 03:52:18,780
I was ten years old on that day April 26 1986 you don't mean
yes Chernobyl that is the day that changed my life and

3785
03:52:18,780 --> 03:52:30,120
thousands of other lives I live just three kilometers north
of there oh my god 600,000 to 700,000 people were evacuated

3786
03:52:30,120 --> 03:52:36,600
over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation
poisoning What about you?

3787
03:52:36,900 --> 03:52:43,180
Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died.

3788
03:52:43,240 --> 03:52:44,080
Are these real stats?

3789
03:52:44,640 --> 03:52:51,300
My parents, and many others like them who helped in the
cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.

3790
03:52:52,460 --> 03:52:56,340
We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons.

3791
03:52:56,540 --> 03:52:57,920
It's mostly gone.

3792
03:52:58,440 --> 03:53:00,260
It's not as heavy, but it's still there a little bit.

3793
03:53:00,620 --> 03:53:07,620
Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us
alive, I will not allow allowed this pain and anxiety to

3794
03:53:07,620 --> 03:53:10,260
pass on to yet another generation.

3795
03:53:10,500 --> 03:53:12,560
I like Nastasha, she's so cool.

3796
03:53:14,640 --> 03:53:15,840
Might have been even more.

3797
03:53:16,020 --> 03:53:16,780
I'm so sad.

3798
03:53:17,560 --> 03:53:18,260
You called Snake?

3799
03:53:27,310 --> 03:53:28,250
Yes, okay.

3800
03:53:30,610 --> 03:53:33,350
All right, let's go fight another boss.

3801
03:53:33,850 --> 03:53:38,730
Snake, in China they say, when walking through a melon
patch, oh, you can't say melon.

3802
03:53:38,830 --> 03:53:40,450
Don't adjust your sandals.

3803
03:53:40,910 --> 03:53:45,570
That means that when things get really bad, you have to try
to remember what's important.

3804
03:53:46,130 --> 03:53:48,730
Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?

3805
03:53:54,290 --> 03:53:56,770
I don't think I've ever heard her say that one.

3806
03:53:57,010 --> 03:53:57,990
Okay, Gonzalo.

3807
03:54:00,130 --> 03:54:01,750
Time for you to leave, Mei Ling.

3808
03:54:02,150 --> 03:54:03,570
I can't believe you said that.

3809
03:54:05,030 --> 03:54:05,690
To me.

3810
03:54:06,350 --> 03:54:07,410
I did save, right?

3811
03:54:07,490 --> 03:54:08,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saved.

3812
03:54:08,410 --> 03:54:08,510
I saved.

3813
03:54:11,030 --> 03:54:13,550
Time for another ridiculous action cutscene.

3814
03:54:13,770 --> 03:54:15,390
See, it just doesn't look as good.

3815
03:54:16,010 --> 03:54:18,490
It just doesn't look as bleak.

3816
03:54:20,070 --> 03:54:21,230
I don't want to be able to see the sky.

3817
03:54:21,530 --> 03:54:23,010
I want it to be pure darkness.

3818
03:54:24,210 --> 03:54:25,730
Oh my god, that was so loud.

3819
03:54:26,310 --> 03:54:27,670
Oh, that was so loud.

3820
03:54:28,250 --> 03:54:29,010
Ow, ow!

3821
03:54:29,770 --> 03:54:30,350
Ow, ow!

3822
03:54:35,260 --> 03:54:35,700
Jump!

3823
03:54:37,920 --> 03:54:38,940
Oh no, Otacon.

3824
03:54:42,420 --> 03:54:44,200
Snake, are you okay?

3825
03:54:44,680 --> 03:54:48,100
Otacon, were there any other stealth prototypes?

3826
03:54:48,240 --> 03:54:48,840
Oh, oh!

3827
03:54:49,240 --> 03:54:50,540
There were only five.

3828
03:54:50,940 --> 03:54:53,200
Nostasha not returning was one of the big losses.

3829
03:54:53,960 --> 03:54:55,320
What are you talking about?

3830
03:54:56,300 --> 03:54:57,380
Someone's shooting at me.

3831
03:55:00,180 --> 03:55:01,180
It's her!

3832
03:55:02,060 --> 03:55:02,380
Wolf.

3833
03:55:03,260 --> 03:55:04,060
Sniper Wolf?

3834
03:55:04,540 --> 03:55:05,560
Yes, it's her.

3835
03:55:05,920 --> 03:55:07,260
It's definitely her.

3836
03:55:07,500 --> 03:55:10,320
Otacon, you sound like you're happy.

3837
03:55:10,840 --> 03:55:12,140
No, I'm not.

3838
03:55:12,360 --> 03:55:13,500
So then what is it?

3839
03:55:15,400 --> 03:55:18,100
Snake, please don't kill her.

3840
03:55:18,140 --> 03:55:18,840
His glasses.

3841
03:55:19,560 --> 03:55:21,960
Please, she's a good person.

3842
03:55:22,660 --> 03:55:24,240
You'd know that if you talked to her.

3843
03:55:24,860 --> 03:55:27,440
That woman isn't as sweet as you think.

3844
03:55:27,920 --> 03:55:30,040
I can see you perfectly for me.

3845
03:55:32,200 --> 03:55:33,480
She's so hot.

3846
03:55:33,560 --> 03:55:36,140
I told you, I'd never quit the hunt.

3847
03:55:37,120 --> 03:55:38,740
Now you're mine.

3848
03:55:38,820 --> 03:55:39,660
Otacon, you're...

3849
03:55:39,660 --> 03:55:39,960
Wolf!

3850
03:55:40,380 --> 03:55:41,320
No, you can't!

3851
03:55:41,840 --> 03:55:44,240
Don't get between a wolf and its prey.

3852
03:55:44,680 --> 03:55:47,300
You're pretty good if you can hit me in this storm.

3853
03:55:47,860 --> 03:55:51,600
You see, women naturally make better soldiers.

3854
03:55:51,920 --> 03:55:53,480
Wolf, don't do this.

3855
03:55:53,760 --> 03:55:54,380
Emotional damage.

3856
03:55:54,880 --> 03:55:56,160
Snake, I'm near.

3857
03:55:57,060 --> 03:55:59,000
Can't you sense me near you?

3858
03:55:59,260 --> 03:56:02,220
It's a mistake for a sniper to reveal her location.

3859
03:56:03,120 --> 03:56:03,800
You think so?

3860
03:56:03,800 --> 03:56:05,400
The tension here is so awesome.

3861
03:56:05,880 --> 03:56:07,760
What I message from me is a message from Beth.

3862
03:56:08,480 --> 03:56:12,140
If I'm close, you will know death is close.

3863
03:56:12,440 --> 03:56:14,320
Please, Wolf, Snake!

3864
03:56:14,680 --> 03:56:15,200
No!

3865
03:56:16,120 --> 03:56:16,120
Quiet!

3866
03:56:16,720 --> 03:56:17,960
Don't get in our way.

3867
03:56:18,020 --> 03:56:18,980
That's a different sniper.

3868
03:56:19,200 --> 03:56:20,180
Now I'll pay you back for Meryl.

3869
03:56:21,000 --> 03:56:23,340
You men are so weak.

3870
03:56:23,760 --> 03:56:26,480
You can never finish what you start.

3871
03:56:29,200 --> 03:56:30,220
I'm weak.

3872
03:56:33,260 --> 03:56:35,660
Now I don't necessarily want to cheese this.

3873
03:56:36,380 --> 03:56:37,700
I think I will...

3874
03:56:37,700 --> 03:56:44,620
I probably will use the sniper if I can find her.

3875
03:56:44,680 --> 03:56:45,420
first.

3876
03:56:46,520 --> 03:56:47,900
It's like so bright.

3877
03:56:48,000 --> 03:56:52,260
Oh, there she I wonder where she is.

3878
03:56:54,320 --> 03:56:55,480
Oh my gosh, it's funny.

3879
03:56:56,700 --> 03:56:58,760
She also kind of runs like Sasquatch.

3880
03:56:59,160 --> 03:56:59,440
Oh my god.

3881
03:56:59,880 --> 03:56:59,880
Ouch!

3882
03:57:01,760 --> 03:57:02,240
Oh.

3883
03:57:03,740 --> 03:57:04,560
Okay, hold on.

3884
03:57:05,760 --> 03:57:07,500
Uh, let's run this way.

3885
03:57:24,430 --> 03:57:25,070
Actually, where?

3886
03:57:25,310 --> 03:57:26,430
Wait, where is she?

3887
03:57:26,550 --> 03:57:26,830
Oh wait.

3888
03:57:27,790 --> 03:57:28,470
Yeah, I saw her.

3889
03:57:29,230 --> 03:57:30,250
Oh, my Medicine!

3890
03:57:31,910 --> 03:57:32,490
Where?

3891
03:57:32,670 --> 03:57:33,270
Oh, there, there, there.

3892
03:57:34,150 --> 03:57:34,370
Okay.

3893
03:57:37,150 --> 03:57:37,470
No!

3894
03:57:37,750 --> 03:57:38,550
How did I miss?

3895
03:57:43,820 --> 03:57:44,960
She going over here?

3896
03:57:47,800 --> 03:57:48,360
No!

3897
03:57:48,460 --> 03:57:49,320
She doubled back!

3898
03:57:49,820 --> 03:57:50,540
You sneaky!

3899
03:57:52,200 --> 03:57:53,120
Where'd she go?

3900
03:57:54,220 --> 03:57:54,960
Where'd she go?

3901
03:57:56,180 --> 03:57:56,980
Where's she hiding?

3902
03:57:59,460 --> 03:58:00,380
There she is!

3903
03:58:05,460 --> 03:58:06,180
Got her?

3904
03:58:10,610 --> 03:58:14,070
Back, oh, it's so sensitive, it's so sensitive.

3905
03:58:14,290 --> 03:58:15,070
Wait, I don't know where she went.

3906
03:58:15,630 --> 03:58:15,910
Uh oh.

3907
03:58:16,550 --> 03:58:17,830
Oh, oh, no, there she is.

3908
03:58:17,970 --> 03:58:19,070
Oh, oh, I lost her.

3909
03:58:19,190 --> 03:58:19,810
Oh no.

3910
03:58:21,630 --> 03:58:22,810
Oh no, hello.

3911
03:58:23,330 --> 03:58:24,310
Where is she running to?

3912
03:58:25,890 --> 03:58:26,590
Oh no.

3913
03:58:29,370 --> 03:58:30,650
You can't get me.

3914
03:58:33,110 --> 03:58:33,690
You can't get me.

3915
03:58:35,870 --> 03:58:36,670
Okay, uh.

3916
03:58:37,910 --> 03:58:38,650
Run, run, run.

3917
03:58:45,900 --> 03:58:47,540
I don't know where she went.

3918
03:58:52,770 --> 03:58:53,570
She could...

3919
03:58:53,570 --> 03:58:57,070
Before I saw, like, the red of her...

3920
03:58:57,070 --> 03:58:57,790
Oh, there, there.

3921
03:58:57,910 --> 03:58:58,310
Oh, shoot.

3922
03:58:58,550 --> 03:58:58,850
Oh, shoot.

3923
03:58:59,110 --> 03:58:59,110
Okay.

3924
03:59:03,680 --> 03:59:04,060
Ah!

3925
03:59:05,840 --> 03:59:07,660
She just stayed behind the tree, right?

3926
03:59:14,490 --> 03:59:15,190
Oh, shoot.

3927
03:59:15,390 --> 03:59:15,750
I'll shoot.

3928
03:59:16,150 --> 03:59:16,770
There we go.

3929
03:59:17,650 --> 03:59:20,310
Oh, no, no, no, no!

3930
03:59:20,670 --> 03:59:21,170
Oh, no!

3931
03:59:23,490 --> 03:59:23,890
You...

3932
03:59:25,910 --> 03:59:26,790
Sniper Wolf.

3933
03:59:28,050 --> 03:59:29,010
I'll get you while you're running.

3934
03:59:30,730 --> 03:59:31,890
As soon as you come out.

3935
03:59:38,420 --> 03:59:40,260
My alert sounds are adorable.

3936
03:59:40,520 --> 03:59:40,980
What do you mean?

3937
03:59:41,360 --> 03:59:41,980
What do you mean?

3938
03:59:45,100 --> 03:59:46,060
By the...

3939
03:59:46,060 --> 03:59:46,860
Oh, dang.

3940
03:59:51,120 --> 03:59:52,340
Come on, Sniper Wolf.

3941
03:59:55,950 --> 03:59:56,210
That way.

3942
03:59:56,410 --> 03:59:56,710
That way.

3943
03:59:56,950 --> 03:59:57,390
That was this way.

3944
03:59:58,930 --> 03:59:59,850
Come on, Sniper Wolf.

3945
04:00:05,790 --> 04:00:07,110
Oh my gosh, my aim.

3946
04:00:07,410 --> 04:00:07,790
My aim!

3947
04:00:11,250 --> 04:00:13,510
Oh, even with the Pazazamine...

3948
04:00:15,630 --> 04:00:16,750
I'm useless.

3949
04:00:19,370 --> 04:00:20,870
It's so, so sensitive!

3950
04:00:21,170 --> 04:00:21,970
Oh my gosh, please.

3951
04:00:23,730 --> 04:00:24,230
Oh my god.

3952
04:00:24,710 --> 04:00:27,510
Oh my gosh.

3953
04:00:29,930 --> 04:00:33,090
Even with the Pazamine, like one millimeter off.

3954
04:00:35,130 --> 04:00:36,250
So crazy.

3955
04:00:36,470 --> 04:00:36,610
Oh.

3956
04:00:37,750 --> 04:00:38,490
Got her.

3957
04:00:42,520 --> 04:00:43,700
Come on, Wolf!

3958
04:00:46,680 --> 04:00:47,700
This is too easy.

3959
04:00:48,760 --> 04:00:51,960
This is actually too easy.

3960
04:00:55,120 --> 04:00:55,580
That's not me!

3961
04:00:56,120 --> 04:00:57,200
That's the Pazazamine!

3962
04:01:00,960 --> 04:01:02,980
Your invincibility frames, huh?

3963
04:01:03,140 --> 04:01:05,160
Sniper Wolf, your invincibility frames.

3964
04:01:10,220 --> 04:01:12,180
Come on out, pretty lady.

3965
04:01:15,320 --> 04:01:23,620
easy come on man that's too easy it's so easy actually i
don't remember struggling much with her original fight

3966
04:01:23,620 --> 04:01:26,740
either though that

3967
04:01:31,270 --> 04:01:41,430
was a lot of blood and this is why this this this exactly is
why i did not grab the tranquilizer that's why this is why i

3968
04:01:41,430 --> 04:01:48,310
went back to the armory only for this scene otherwise this
scene would be useless I mean pointless.

3969
04:01:53,720 --> 04:01:55,860
She's so awesome.

3970
04:02:02,130 --> 04:02:03,450
Snake, stop standing!

3971
04:02:04,070 --> 04:02:06,550
Wait, what are you... stop standing in places?

3972
04:02:07,590 --> 04:02:08,250
Like, actually!

3973
04:02:09,190 --> 04:02:10,670
Oh my god.

3974
04:02:11,810 --> 04:02:13,230
Oh, he...

3975
04:02:13,230 --> 04:02:13,230
yeah!

3976
04:02:15,150 --> 04:02:16,070
Oh!

3977
04:02:17,750 --> 04:02:18,670
Oh!

3978
04:02:19,070 --> 04:02:19,370
Oh!

3979
04:02:23,710 --> 04:02:25,090
No scope.

3980
04:02:25,810 --> 04:02:27,070
360, no scope.

3981
04:02:28,910 --> 04:02:29,690
He flipped.

3982
04:02:32,170 --> 04:02:33,130
He did a flip.

3983
04:02:44,180 --> 04:02:46,660
Oh, because my headshots did nothing, you know.

3984
04:02:49,280 --> 04:02:51,440
Somersault 360 with scope.

3985
04:02:54,180 --> 04:02:55,080
I don't remember that.

3986
04:02:55,200 --> 04:02:56,320
Welcome to the Twin Snakes.

3987
04:03:08,280 --> 04:03:10,240
See if there's anything around here.

3988
04:03:10,460 --> 04:03:14,780
I think I can also loot after the scene, though.

3989
04:03:15,600 --> 04:03:16,280
Oh, Otacon.

3990
04:03:17,420 --> 04:03:18,500
Otacon, don't look.

3991
04:03:21,340 --> 04:03:22,180
Otacon, don't look.

3992
04:03:22,400 --> 04:03:23,120
Otacon will remember that.

3993
04:03:23,240 --> 04:03:24,140
No, don't look.

3994
04:03:24,520 --> 04:03:25,340
Don't look, Otacon.

3995
04:03:28,730 --> 04:03:32,350
But this scene without the best is yet to come in the
background is not...

3996
04:03:32,350 --> 04:03:33,970
I've waited for this moment.

3997
04:03:34,030 --> 04:03:35,050
But it still makes me so sad.

3998
04:03:35,070 --> 04:03:37,210
I am a sniper.

3999
04:03:38,870 --> 04:03:40,230
Waiting is my job.

4000
04:03:42,170 --> 04:03:44,090
Never moving a muscle.

4001
04:03:45,570 --> 04:03:46,310
Concentrating.

4002
04:03:48,370 --> 04:03:48,830
Oh my god.

4003
04:03:49,070 --> 04:03:49,570
Oh my god.

4004
04:03:50,890 --> 04:03:52,670
I am lungshot.

4005
04:03:53,370 --> 04:03:54,850
You cannot save me.

4006
04:03:55,950 --> 04:03:56,430
Please.

4007
04:03:57,630 --> 04:03:59,090
Just finish me quick.

4008
04:04:01,210 --> 04:04:02,010
I am a curd.

4009
04:04:02,750 --> 04:04:05,050
I have always dreamed of a piece.

4010
04:04:05,070 --> 04:04:19,350
place like this occurred so that's why you're called wolf I
was born on the battlefield raised on the battlefield

4011
04:04:19,350 --> 04:04:37,010
gunfire sirens and screams they were my lullabies hunted
like dogs day after day driven from our ragged shelters That

4012
04:04:37,010 --> 04:04:38,570
was my life.

4013
04:04:40,170 --> 04:04:46,310
Each morning I'd wake up and find a few more of my family or
friends dead beside me.

4014
04:04:47,770 --> 04:04:52,570
I'd stare at the morning sun and pray to make it through the
day.

4015
04:04:54,890 --> 04:04:58,130
The governments of the world turned a blind eye to our
misery.

4016
04:04:59,510 --> 04:05:02,230
But then, he appeared.

4017
04:05:03,230 --> 04:05:04,050
My hero.

4018
04:05:05,170 --> 04:05:05,970
Saladin.

4019
04:05:07,330 --> 04:05:09,350
He took me away from all that.

4020
04:05:10,370 --> 04:05:10,490
Big boss.

4021
04:05:11,510 --> 04:05:12,550
You mean big boss?

4022
04:05:15,890 --> 04:05:17,990
I became a sniper.

4023
04:05:18,930 --> 04:05:19,730
Hidden.

4024
04:05:20,910 --> 04:05:23,450
Watching everything through a rifle scope.

4025
04:05:24,930 --> 04:05:32,390
Now I could see war not from the inside, but from the
outside as an observer.

4026
04:05:35,070 --> 04:05:42,950
I watched the brutality, the stupidity of mankind through
the scope of my rifle.

4027
04:05:49,670 --> 04:05:50,370
Nine.

4028
04:05:51,270 --> 04:05:52,370
Little Pops.

4029
04:05:54,050 --> 04:05:59,470
I joined this group of revolutionaries to take my revenge on
the world.

4030
04:06:00,730 --> 04:06:02,250
Oh, even this small guy.

4031
04:06:03,010 --> 04:06:05,710
I have shamed myself and my people.

4032
04:06:06,850 --> 04:06:08,630
I am no longer the wolf I have.

4033
04:06:08,650 --> 04:06:20,330
was born to be in the name of vengeance i sold my body and
my soul now i am nothing more than a dog

4034
04:06:23,350 --> 04:06:32,110
wolves are noble animals they're not like dogs so so gentle
the word for wolf is kaglinak and the aliots revere them as

4035
04:06:32,110 --> 04:06:42,270
honorable cousins they call mercenaries like us dogs of war
we're all for sale for some price or another it's when

4036
04:06:42,270 --> 04:07:00,370
Otakon comes in that makes me really cry solitary you're no
dog you're a wolf no oh oh who are you are you Saladin wolf

4037
04:07:00,370 --> 04:07:11,970

onlooker I don't like to see or children get hurt rest easy

4038
04:07:11,970 --> 04:07:25,510
you'll die as the proud wolf you are you wolf i finally
understand i wasn't waiting to kill people i was waiting for

4039

04:08:08,050 --> 04:08:17,470
what is it this part's so sad too give it to me she's not
even reaching out to otakon She's just...

4042
04:08:18,090 --> 04:08:19,430
She just wants her guide.

4043
04:08:19,770 --> 04:08:21,150
She doesn't care about you, Otakon.

4044
04:08:26,000 --> 04:08:27,440
She is part of me.

4045
04:08:30,400 --> 04:08:30,520
Ah!

4046
04:08:33,240 --> 04:08:35,560
It sounded like the willow scream.

4047
04:08:40,700 --> 04:08:41,400
Oh my gosh.

4048
04:08:41,620 --> 04:08:42,900
These dogs look so goofy.

4049
04:08:43,160 --> 04:08:45,260
The tiny dog looks so happy.

4050
04:08:45,420 --> 04:08:45,980
Like a kid.

4051
04:08:46,660 --> 04:08:47,480
Oh gosh.

4052
04:08:48,640 --> 04:08:49,160
Everyone.

4056
04:10:11,380 --> 04:10:12,500
Oh, the handkerchief.

4057
04:10:16,540 --> 04:10:17,800
Returning it to its owner.

4058
04:10:18,620 --> 04:10:19,520
I don't need a handkerchief.

4059
04:10:21,080 --> 04:10:21,320
Why?

4060
04:10:23,660 --> 04:10:26,120
I don't have any more tears to shed.

4061
04:10:29,620 --> 04:10:31,340
He cries more.

4062
04:10:33,480 --> 04:10:35,080
I'm going to the underground base.

4063
04:10:35,460 --> 04:10:36,400
We're out of time.

4064
04:10:38,140 --> 04:10:49,860

anyone you too yeah if I can't stop Metal Gear this whole

4067
04:11:10,740 --> 04:11:11,920
It's in my ear.

4068
04:11:12,300 --> 04:11:13,960
A head start on your new life.

4069
04:11:24,480 --> 04:11:25,160
This book.

4070
04:11:30,720 --> 04:11:31,260
Snake!

4071
04:11:36,140 --> 04:11:37,640
What was she fighting for?

4072
04:11:41,920 --> 04:11:43,860
What am I fighting for?

4073
04:11:46,480 --> 04:11:48,580
What are you fighting for?

4074
04:11:53,910 --> 04:11:57,110
If we make it through this, I'll tell you.

4075
04:11:58,990 --> 04:11:59,480
Okay

4076
04:12:04,050 --> 04:12:07,380
Okay, I'll be searching too

4077
04:12:13,170 --> 04:12:17,410
Okay I love it

4078
04:12:23,550 --> 04:12:29,250
Okay I love that light so much.

4079
04:12:29,550 --> 04:12:32,450
Oh my gosh Oh.

4080
04:12:33,570 --> 04:12:34,190
Oh.

4081
04:12:35,650 --> 04:12:37,690
Oh, a sniper wolf.

4082
04:12:38,470 --> 04:12:39,350
I'm sorry.

4083
04:12:40,310 --> 04:12:41,350
Sorry, Otacon.

4084
04:12:41,890 --> 04:12:42,330
I'm sorry.

4085
04:12:43,330 --> 04:12:46,290
Wait a second.

4086
04:12:47,050 --> 04:12:51,210
Oh, wait a second.

4087
04:12:53,470 --> 04:12:55,970
I recognize this place.

4088
04:13:09,400 --> 04:13:10,600
Oh, don't stand up, Snake.

4089
04:13:10,940 --> 04:13:11,120
Snake.

4090
04:13:11,260 --> 04:13:11,960
Snake, don't stand up.

4091
04:13:14,100 --> 04:13:15,140
Oh, uh...

4092
04:13:15,140 --> 04:13:15,900
Oh, I'm all full.

4093
04:13:18,560 --> 04:13:20,200
This death trap.

4094
04:13:21,680 --> 04:13:22,880
The VTuber room.

4095
04:13:23,080 --> 04:13:24,020
It actually is, though.

4096
04:13:24,100 --> 04:13:26,400
I think everyone who plays this...

4097
04:13:26,400 --> 04:13:27,500
who's never played it before.

4098
04:13:28,180 --> 04:13:29,000
Get her dog tag.

4099
04:13:29,120 --> 04:13:29,940
How do I get that?

4100
04:13:36,710 --> 04:13:37,230
Oh.

4101
04:13:37,670 --> 04:13:38,430
Oh, hello.

4102
04:13:41,850 --> 04:13:43,430
What am I fighting for?

4103
04:13:43,590 --> 04:13:48,090
Even with the music cinematic change from the PS1, this
scene still hits all...

Okay, hold on.

4109
04:14:26,200 --> 04:14:27,160
Just, uh...

4110
04:14:27,160 --> 04:14:28,700
Okay, hold on.

4111
04:14:28,840 --> 04:14:29,700
Let me match it up.

4112
04:14:30,260 --> 04:14:30,680
Hold on.

4113
04:14:32,600 --> 04:14:33,080
Okay.

4114
04:14:35,220 --> 04:14:35,980
Oh, shoot.

4115
04:14:36,160 --> 04:14:36,720
Okay, hold on.

4116
04:14:36,980 --> 04:14:38,620
Just a little bit more.

4117
04:14:40,900 --> 04:14:41,380
Uh...

4118
04:14:41,880 --> 04:14:43,280
Okay, hold on, hold on.

4119
04:14:43,320 --> 04:14:45,880
I gotta match it up so it doesn't, you know...

4120
04:14:45,880 --> 04:14:47,020
Okay, okay, hold on.

4121
04:14:47,100 --> 04:14:49,100
I gotta just, uh...

4122
04:14:49,100 --> 04:14:51,260
Look for the Hein-D wreckage in first person.

4123
04:14:51,440 --> 04:14:52,440
Oh, you can see that.

4124
04:14:52,720 --> 04:14:53,500
Hold on, hold on.

4125
04:14:53,600 --> 04:14:54,020
I'm gonna get it.

4126
04:14:54,080 --> 04:14:54,680
I'm gonna get it, puppy.

4127
04:14:54,820 --> 04:14:55,300
I'm gonna get it.

4128
04:14:56,580 --> 04:14:57,320
Okay, hold on.

4129
04:14:57,820 --> 04:14:58,380
Okay, hold on.

4130
04:14:58,500 --> 04:14:59,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4131
04:15:00,200 --> 04:15:01,380
And, uh, wait.

4132
04:15:02,020 --> 04:15:03,660
Like that.

4133
04:15:10,130 --> 04:15:11,130
Oh, what's that sound?

4134
04:15:14,090 --> 04:15:18,990
I think I, I think I, I think I, I think I glitched the
game.

4135
04:15:22,630 --> 04:15:25,450
You could still hear the sounds of me pulling her, I think.

4136
04:15:26,710 --> 04:15:28,110
Unless this is a different sound.

4137
04:15:30,430 --> 04:15:31,030
Thank you!

4138
04:15:32,030 --> 04:15:33,030
Just because you're a ghost.

4139
04:15:33,630 --> 04:15:35,450
You can't just disrespect the dead like that mint.

4140
04:15:35,930 --> 04:15:37,170
Is there no afterlife decency?

4141
04:15:37,810 --> 04:15:39,810
No one treated my body with decency.

4142
04:15:41,310 --> 04:15:42,050
Actually, I don't know.

4143
04:15:42,250 --> 04:15:43,050
It was so long ago.

4144
04:15:43,110 --> 04:15:44,310
I don't know what happened to my body.

4145
04:15:45,950 --> 04:15:47,230
I don't see the...

4146
04:15:47,230 --> 04:15:47,990
Oh, let me try the scope.

4147
04:15:55,620 --> 04:15:56,340
Hindee!

4148
04:15:58,200 --> 04:15:59,580
I can't see anything now.

4149
04:16:00,940 --> 04:16:01,660
Hindee!

4150
04:16:07,090 --> 04:16:07,810
Hindee!

4151
04:16:13,020 --> 04:16:14,260
Where would it be?

4152
04:16:15,860 --> 04:16:17,180
Where would it be at?

4153
04:16:19,140 --> 04:16:20,340
It's so windy.

4154
04:16:24,540 --> 04:16:25,280
Towards the south.

4155
04:16:30,680 --> 04:16:32,000
This isn't where I go.

4156
04:16:33,460 --> 04:16:34,180
Hmm.

4157
04:16:51,390 --> 04:16:54,890
just in case okay

4158
04:16:58,150 --> 04:17:08,610
oh it's more chaffs which I didn't use any which is crazy
more towards the south like down here down here

4159
04:17:13,780 --> 04:17:26,540
down this way the paranoia can you blame me let's try going
up um Is that gold medicine?

4160
04:17:27,980 --> 04:17:29,660
Oh, it's a bandage.

4161
04:17:39,410 --> 04:17:41,010
Nothing here.

4162
04:17:41,710 --> 04:17:42,650
To the right side.

4163
04:17:43,270 --> 04:17:45,330
Wait, like, is this right?

4164
04:17:45,530 --> 04:17:45,930
Which right?

4165
04:17:46,290 --> 04:17:47,010
Who's right?

4166
04:17:49,130 --> 04:17:50,070
Who's right?

4167
04:17:52,350 --> 04:17:54,290
Right side beyond the fence.

4168
04:18:03,240 --> 04:18:04,780
Snake is right.

4169
04:18:05,280 --> 04:18:05,460
Huh?

4170
04:18:12,920 --> 04:18:14,020
Look at this.

4171
04:18:15,420 --> 04:18:16,480
Are they gonna see me?

4172
04:18:19,960 --> 04:18:21,720
From the mini-map bottom right.

4173
04:18:21,800 --> 04:18:22,840
Okay, okay, give me a second.

4174
04:18:23,340 --> 04:18:24,120
I'll grab them.

4175
04:18:24,360 --> 04:18:25,280
Or I'll go look in a second.

4176
04:18:26,860 --> 04:18:27,680
There's the other one.

4177
04:18:29,600 --> 04:18:31,140
There we go.

4178
04:18:38,730 --> 04:18:39,550
More bandage.

4179
04:18:40,550 --> 04:18:41,350
Full on right.

4180
04:18:41,410 --> 04:18:42,910
This game is so generous.

4181
04:18:43,430 --> 04:18:44,250
Holy cow.

4182
04:18:45,130 --> 04:18:45,890
Holy cow.

4183
04:18:46,050 --> 04:18:46,830
Okay, so this way.

4184
04:18:48,410 --> 04:18:50,410
La la la la la la la.

4185
04:18:50,810 --> 04:18:54,770
La la la la la la la.

4186
04:18:55,490 --> 04:18:56,010
Here?

4187
04:18:58,350 --> 04:19:01,570
I can't see you over the dang fence.

4188
04:19:04,530 --> 04:19:05,770
Maybe up here?

4189
04:19:06,330 --> 04:19:06,590
Oh, wait.

4190
04:19:07,130 --> 04:19:08,370
That was down there.

4191
04:19:09,530 --> 04:19:10,270
Over here?

4192
04:19:15,140 --> 04:19:15,620
Hmm.

4193
04:19:18,040 --> 04:19:19,560
I saw it.

4194
04:19:20,040 --> 04:19:20,240
Oh!

4195
04:19:20,880 --> 04:19:21,180
Huh?

4196
04:19:21,540 --> 04:19:22,240
Oh my gosh!

4197
04:19:22,940 --> 04:19:23,340
Oh!

4198
04:19:23,920 --> 04:19:25,340
There it was!

4199
04:19:25,840 --> 04:19:26,840
Colonel, listen to me.

4200
04:19:27,260 --> 04:19:29,520
I found a parachute near the wreckage of the Hind.

4201
04:19:30,240 --> 04:19:30,860
A parachute?

4202
04:19:31,580 --> 04:19:33,360
You don't think the liquid survived?

4203
04:19:34,100 --> 04:19:34,660
No way.

4204
04:19:35,060 --> 04:19:37,240
He'd be mad to try to escape by parachute.

4205
04:19:37,940 --> 04:19:41,220
As soon as he jumped out of the pilot seat, he'd be cut to
ribbons by the rotor blades.

4206
04:19:42,320 --> 04:19:44,160
So what's that parachute doing there then?

4207
04:19:44,340 --> 04:19:45,540
I have no idea.

4208
04:19:46,420 --> 04:19:47,640
He's dog food now.

4209
04:19:47,860 --> 04:19:48,960
Either that or a message.

4210
04:19:49,620 --> 04:19:50,020
To me.

4211
04:19:50,020 --> 04:20:02,920
meaning I'm not dead I suppose no maybe but I think it's
more like I'll string you up no we took care of that guy we

4212
04:20:02,920 --> 04:20:09,960

Naomi you wouldn't believe it I think I think it's

4219
04:21:24,460 --> 04:21:29,820
incredible how how advanced they've become in such a short
amount of time!

4220
04:21:30,840 --> 04:21:31,320
Is that it?

4221
04:21:31,380 --> 04:21:31,740
Right there?

4222
04:21:33,380 --> 04:21:33,700
Yeah.

4223
04:21:37,140 --> 04:21:37,720
Disc 2!

4224
04:21:40,320 --> 04:21:46,300
It's rumored that Kojima ended Solid Snake's story at MGS4
because he wanted to focus more on Big Boss's story in later

4225
04:21:46,300 --> 04:21:46,680
games.

4226
04:21:47,260 --> 04:21:48,340
What's your opinion on this?

4227
04:21:51,140 --> 04:21:52,260
I mean...

4228
04:21:52,260 --> 04:21:54,640
I think Snake told his whole story, though.

4229
04:21:55,460 --> 04:21:56,360
To be honest.

4230
04:21:57,500 --> 04:21:58,060
Oh.

4231
04:21:58,080 --> 04:22:00,120
The blast furnace!

4232
04:22:01,000 --> 04:22:03,080
Oh my gosh, how could I forget about this part?

4233
04:22:08,570 --> 04:22:09,630
Oh, uh, uh, uh.

4234
04:22:14,190 --> 04:22:15,310
Oh, that was, uh...

4235
04:22:15,310 --> 04:22:15,670
Who's there?

4236
04:22:15,810 --> 04:22:16,110
No one?

4237
04:22:16,970 --> 04:22:17,350
No one.

4238
04:22:18,110 --> 04:22:18,690
Hold on.

4239
04:22:18,890 --> 04:22:20,890
You don't have a...

4240
04:22:29,860 --> 04:22:30,300
Okay.

4241
04:22:30,920 --> 04:22:32,200
It's so loud in here.

4242
04:22:32,680 --> 04:22:33,080
Holy cow.

4243
04:22:39,460 --> 04:22:40,540
Oh my gosh.

4244
04:22:40,780 --> 04:22:41,100
Nothing?

4245
04:22:41,560 --> 04:22:41,860
Nothing?

4246
04:22:42,260 --> 04:22:42,940
Nothing?

4247
04:22:43,860 --> 04:22:43,860
Nothing?

4248
04:22:44,800 --> 04:22:45,920
Was that sound?

4249
04:22:46,560 --> 04:22:47,180
What are you doing?

4250
04:22:47,220 --> 04:22:48,770
What are you doing coming all the way over here?

4251
04:22:50,920 --> 04:22:51,700
Hold on.

4252
04:22:51,860 --> 04:22:52,920
I think I can...

4253
04:22:52,920 --> 04:22:53,060
Oh.

4254
04:22:57,760 --> 04:22:58,300
Okay.

4255
04:22:59,520 --> 04:23:00,060
Alright.

4256
04:23:02,700 --> 04:23:03,240
Okay.

4257
04:23:03,640 --> 04:23:05,420
They don't do reports in here, I guess.

4258
04:23:05,760 --> 04:23:07,220
It's too noisy and stuff.

4259
04:23:07,900 --> 04:23:08,080
Huh?

4260
04:23:10,980 --> 04:23:11,520
Alright.

4261
04:23:11,940 --> 04:23:13,540
I should probably save.

4262
04:23:15,880 --> 04:23:22,060
I should probably say, even though I feel like, you know, if
we die, we just start back at the door, but it's fine.

4263
04:23:22,220 --> 04:23:23,640
I'll save just in case, you know.

4264
04:23:25,040 --> 04:23:27,380
IWSFJ, welcome to membership, thank you!

4265
04:23:29,660 --> 04:23:31,240
Who are you, like, with your status report?

4266
04:23:32,720 --> 04:23:39,180
Guys, actually, I think also, maybe it doesn't come so
quickly if there's no, like, most of the time I feel like I

4267
04:23:39,180 --> 04:23:40,180
take out these guys.

4268
04:23:41,740 --> 04:23:44,340
It's in front of a camera.

4269
04:23:45,360 --> 04:23:50,160
If you have confidence that what you're doing is part of
your true nature, there should be no hesitation.

4270
04:23:50,820 --> 04:23:56,480
I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or
not, but Snake, believe in yourself.

4271
04:24:01,740 --> 04:24:03,960
I'll try for you, Mealing.

4272
04:24:31,970 --> 04:24:34,230
The cutscene was kind of awesome, though.

4273
04:24:36,110 --> 04:24:37,510
Very Terminator, right?

4274
04:24:41,800 --> 04:24:43,260
Are these guys awake again?

4275
04:24:45,160 --> 04:24:46,080
Of course he is.

4276
04:25:04,620 --> 04:25:07,320
Maybe I can take this other guy out from up here anyway.

4277
04:25:08,460 --> 04:25:09,480
If I can see him.

4278
04:25:10,800 --> 04:25:12,060
Actually, I don't know if I can see him.

4279
04:25:14,900 --> 04:25:15,700
Where is he?

4280
04:25:16,560 --> 04:25:16,920
Oh!

4281
04:25:23,020 --> 04:25:24,340
Is there another guy?

4282
04:25:26,420 --> 04:25:27,380
Am I just here?

4283
04:25:27,460 --> 04:25:28,520
Or I'm just...

4284
04:25:28,520 --> 04:25:29,440
I'm hearing something.

4285
04:25:29,560 --> 04:25:30,760
I think maybe I'm just hearing that thing.

4286
04:25:35,660 --> 04:25:37,180
Stung gun.

4287
04:25:37,840 --> 04:25:38,400
Grenade.

4288
04:25:39,600 --> 04:25:39,800
Hmm.

4289
04:25:48,150 --> 04:25:49,850
Oh my god, no!

4290
04:25:51,810 --> 04:25:55,570
Oh no, I, I, I, I, oh my god, no!

4291
04:25:56,910 --> 04:25:57,150
No!

4292
04:26:02,330 --> 04:26:03,950
I, I, I, I...

4293
04:26:04,810 --> 04:26:05,570
Oh.

4294
04:26:14,780 --> 04:26:17,560
Gosh, darn it.

4295
04:26:18,220 --> 04:26:19,060
Get his head.

4296
04:26:28,360 --> 04:26:29,420
Oh, dang, I was close.

4297
04:26:37,320 --> 04:26:39,300
I want to take out his radio.

4298
04:26:40,180 --> 04:26:40,900
Just in case.

4299
04:26:41,300 --> 04:26:43,740
I don't think it does anything, but, you know, just in case.

4300
04:26:47,660 --> 04:26:48,440
Uh, uh.

4301
04:26:48,580 --> 04:26:49,900
I don't want to shoot you in the butt, buddy.

4302
04:26:50,300 --> 04:26:51,200
Yeah, there we go.

4303
04:26:51,940 --> 04:26:52,300
Uh.

4304
04:26:52,540 --> 04:26:54,160
Uh, uh...

4305
04:26:54,160 --> 04:26:55,700
Okay, here we go.

4306
04:26:56,460 --> 04:26:59,000
And here we...

4307
04:26:59,000 --> 04:26:59,700
Don't go.

4308
04:27:01,080 --> 04:27:02,100
What a way to go.

4309
04:27:03,020 --> 04:27:05,180
Shot in the butt by a V-Tuber.

4310
04:27:06,440 --> 04:27:06,960
Pathetic.

4311
04:27:08,140 --> 04:27:09,240
Absolutely pathetic.

4312
04:27:13,640 --> 04:27:14,800
I could take him out.

4313
04:27:16,060 --> 04:27:17,360
Might actually be easier.

4314
04:27:19,360 --> 04:27:20,040
Hmm...

4315
04:27:20,040 --> 04:27:21,360
Hmm...

4316
04:27:21,360 --> 04:27:21,940
Um, hello?

4317
04:27:22,080 --> 04:27:22,840
Where is this guy?

4318
04:27:24,500 --> 04:27:25,880
Did he sneak past me?

4319
04:27:28,580 --> 04:27:29,340
Where is he?

4320
04:27:29,500 --> 04:27:30,260
Oh, there he is.

4321
04:27:32,020 --> 04:27:32,660
Come on.

4322
04:27:36,740 --> 04:27:37,920
I gave you a little bit more.

4323
04:27:39,520 --> 04:27:40,000
There we go.

4324
04:27:42,400 --> 04:27:43,040
Okay, controller.

4325
04:27:44,000 --> 04:27:44,640
Was this...

4326
04:27:44,640 --> 04:27:45,100
You know what?

4327
04:27:45,120 --> 04:27:46,640
Maybe this part would be easier with the D-pad.

4328
04:27:48,880 --> 04:27:50,020
I'm not so sure, though.

4329
04:27:51,120 --> 04:27:51,720
Actually, no.

4330
04:27:51,820 --> 04:27:52,540
I don't think it will be.

4331
04:27:52,780 --> 04:27:53,480
Okay, here we go.

4332
04:27:54,480 --> 04:27:55,020
Slow and steady.

4333
04:27:58,040 --> 04:27:59,500
My hand is getting sweaty!

4334
04:28:08,390 --> 04:28:10,590
Stinger the crane get revenge in.

4335
04:28:12,850 --> 04:28:14,810
Okay, I'm gonna wipe my hands.

4336
04:28:19,910 --> 04:28:20,170
Okay.

4337
04:28:32,420 --> 04:28:32,940
Oopsie.

4338
04:28:33,680 --> 04:28:34,420
There we go.

4339
04:28:46,950 --> 04:28:48,550
I don't think I got his butt.

4340
04:28:49,850 --> 04:28:51,650
Oh man, I didn't get his butt.

4341
04:28:53,270 --> 04:28:54,610
Oh, it's fine then.

4342
04:28:54,790 --> 04:28:54,910
Oh.

4343
04:28:55,610 --> 04:28:56,290
Oh shoot.

4344
04:28:56,530 --> 04:28:56,670
Oh shoot.

4345
04:29:07,690 --> 04:29:08,030
There we go.

4346
04:29:08,410 --> 04:29:08,410
Okay.

4347
04:29:09,050 --> 04:29:09,350
Okay.

4348
04:29:15,090 --> 04:29:16,850
Okay, it's coming back.

4349
04:29:17,430 --> 04:29:20,870
Oh, I have to be just a little rat.

4350
04:29:21,730 --> 04:29:23,070
No Terminator thumbs up.

4351
04:29:23,310 --> 04:29:25,010
Zero out of ten bad game.

4352
04:29:27,390 --> 04:29:29,970
Oh, to be just a little rat who can crawl right under.

4353
04:29:32,730 --> 04:29:33,230
Okay.

4354
04:29:33,670 --> 04:29:34,350
Oh, wow.

4355
04:29:34,610 --> 04:29:35,930
The fake out was real.

4356
04:29:38,390 --> 04:29:38,890
Okay.

4357
04:29:45,350 --> 04:29:47,430
Wait, let's get him so sweaty.

4358
04:29:48,050 --> 04:29:48,350
Okay.

4359
04:29:49,350 --> 04:29:50,210
Okay, okay, okay.

4360
04:29:56,290 --> 04:29:57,930
Oh, I remember!

4361
04:29:58,510 --> 04:29:58,650
Oh!

4362
04:30:03,230 --> 04:30:03,950
Keep going.

4363
04:30:04,370 --> 04:30:05,390
Please, please, please.

4364
04:30:05,950 --> 04:30:06,090
Okay.

4365
04:30:09,870 --> 04:30:11,410
There we go.

4366
04:30:28,850 --> 04:30:29,630
There's some...

4367
04:30:33,420 --> 04:30:34,320
There's some...

4368
04:30:34,340 --> 04:30:37,000
some things though.

4369
04:30:38,140 --> 04:30:39,140
Yay, you did it.

4370
04:30:39,440 --> 04:30:41,100
Yay, I did it.

4371
04:30:41,320 --> 04:30:42,340
Where'd that...

4372
04:30:42,960 --> 04:30:43,960
Where'd that camera go?

4373
04:30:44,340 --> 04:30:44,980
Oh, there's one.

4374
04:30:53,110 --> 04:30:55,090
Well, we just need to go through there.

4375
04:30:55,870 --> 04:30:56,510
So I think we're good.

4376
04:30:57,270 --> 04:30:58,710
Actually, I can't see anything.

4377
04:30:58,870 --> 04:31:00,070
It's so hard to tell where I'm going.

4378
04:31:07,180 --> 04:31:08,680
It's so easy!

4379
04:31:10,440 --> 04:31:12,120
It's so easy!

4380
04:31:13,420 --> 04:31:15,180
It's so easy!

4381
04:31:17,080 --> 04:31:18,120
No way!

4382
04:31:21,720 --> 04:31:22,760
No way!

4383
04:31:30,650 --> 04:31:31,070
Oh.

4384
04:31:33,890 --> 04:31:34,630
What's going on?

4385
04:31:34,710 --> 04:31:35,070
What is that?

4386
04:31:35,350 --> 04:31:35,430
Oh!

4387
04:31:39,480 --> 04:31:41,000
Oh wait, I have her dog tags.

4388
04:31:41,800 --> 04:31:42,460
That's so cool.

4389
04:31:43,220 --> 04:31:44,660
I didn't know they'd be in my inventory.

4390
04:31:45,300 --> 04:31:45,720
Oh, here we go.

4391
04:31:48,920 --> 04:31:49,440
Hmm.

4392
04:31:54,200 --> 04:31:56,660
Seems a little suspicious to me.

4393
04:32:00,160 --> 04:32:00,680
Oh, dang.

4394
04:32:04,390 --> 04:32:05,370
Oh, what's this?

4395
04:32:06,630 --> 04:32:07,350
Gotta check everything.

4396
04:32:07,550 --> 04:32:09,410
Yes, very good, very good.

4397
04:32:10,670 --> 04:32:12,450
Okay, here we go.

4398
04:32:12,610 --> 04:32:16,150
Ready for Raven?

4399
04:32:16,870 --> 04:32:17,150
Yes.

4400
04:32:20,170 --> 04:32:21,590
Yes, oh yeah.

4401
04:32:21,710 --> 04:32:23,070
Oh wait, we have to fight some more people in here.

4402
04:32:23,090 --> 04:32:24,070
here don't we?

4403
04:32:24,670 --> 04:32:25,290
Oh no.

4404
04:32:27,270 --> 04:32:29,010
I think this is my favorite updated cutscene.

4405
04:32:29,350 --> 04:32:29,350
Really?

4406
04:32:30,470 --> 04:32:31,130
Wow!

4407
04:32:41,500 --> 04:32:44,360
Why did it explode in the middle?

4408
04:32:45,220 --> 04:32:46,380
Why did it do that?

4409
04:32:48,580 --> 04:32:50,460
Oh, whoa!

4410
04:32:51,940 --> 04:32:53,260
Oh my gosh.

4411
04:32:54,840 --> 04:32:55,360
Look up.

4412
04:32:55,600 --> 04:32:56,440
He's He's doing the pose.

4413
04:32:56,580 --> 04:32:57,100
Oh, not anymore.

4414
04:33:00,880 --> 04:33:02,220
Why did the hat explode?

4415
04:33:07,270 --> 04:33:08,610
Oh wait, I'm fixing my contact.

4416
04:33:11,130 --> 04:33:11,330
Okay.

4417
04:33:11,830 --> 04:33:13,370
Oh, he's right behind me!

4418
04:33:15,210 --> 04:33:16,510
Are they all just running around?

4419
04:33:17,830 --> 04:33:18,350
Ow, jump!

4420
04:33:19,690 --> 04:33:19,850
Oh.

4421
04:33:21,310 --> 04:33:22,470
Ow, jump, jump, jump.

4422
04:33:23,510 --> 04:33:24,490
Yeah, I have the body armor.

4423
04:33:30,140 --> 04:33:30,940
I'm reloading.

4424
04:33:36,880 --> 04:33:37,280
Okay.

4425
04:33:40,140 --> 04:33:41,460
No problems here.

4426
04:33:43,340 --> 04:33:44,680
Thank you for the raid!

4427
04:33:45,380 --> 04:33:45,920
Thank you.

4428
04:33:46,180 --> 04:33:48,140
I didn't see who raided, but thank you so much.

4429
04:33:49,860 --> 04:33:50,660
Thank you.

4430
04:33:50,660 --> 04:33:52,140
Thank you.

4431
04:33:52,780 --> 04:33:53,180
Oh,

4432
04:33:59,640 --> 04:34:00,160
you hurt Snake.

4433
04:34:00,280 --> 04:34:00,660
Hang in there.

4434
04:34:00,780 --> 04:34:01,540
I know you can do it.

4435
04:34:01,700 --> 04:34:02,940
I'm hanging in there too.

4436
04:34:03,100 --> 04:34:03,840
For you, Snake.

4437
04:34:04,320 --> 04:34:06,040
You keep hanging in there, Meryl.

4438
04:34:07,540 --> 04:34:09,820
You're doing amazing.

4439
04:34:10,520 --> 04:34:11,440
Oh my god.

4440
04:34:12,560 --> 04:34:12,800
Hey!

4441
04:34:13,340 --> 04:34:15,120
Um, delayed much?

4442
04:34:19,090 --> 04:34:20,270
Oh, there it is.

4443
04:34:22,350 --> 04:34:23,630
Oh, yeah, I got it.

4444
04:34:27,620 --> 04:34:29,980
This also has mines in here, though, doesn't it?

4445
04:34:30,680 --> 04:34:32,320
Am I just being...

4446
04:34:32,320 --> 04:34:33,800
I'm not being paranoid, am I?

4447
04:34:34,500 --> 04:34:37,400
I could have sworn there's some mines somewhere around here.

4448
04:34:40,000 --> 04:34:40,460
Whoa!

4449
04:34:41,100 --> 04:34:41,600
Whoa!

4450
04:34:41,860 --> 04:34:42,520
Oh, this...

4451
04:34:42,520 --> 04:34:43,680
Now this is the elevator.

4452
04:34:46,460 --> 04:34:49,800
to to to

4453
04:34:53,190 --> 04:35:02,450

4459
04:35:43,060 --> 04:35:45,440
yeah what's up what is it i was in

4460
04:35:49,200 --> 04:35:50,160
Don't be rude.

4461
04:35:50,260 --> 04:35:51,960
Dr. Hunter's story about her background.

4462
04:35:52,440 --> 04:35:56,200
About her grandfather being an assistant secretary to Hoover
in the FBI.

4463
04:35:56,740 --> 04:35:56,760
Uh-huh.

4464
04:35:58,060 --> 04:36:00,340
And then going undercover to investigate the mafia.

4465
04:36:00,520 --> 04:36:01,040
Yeah.

4466
04:36:01,840 --> 04:36:02,380
What about it?

4467
04:36:02,900 --> 04:36:03,000
Mm-hmm.

4468
04:36:03,800 --> 04:36:05,220
It was all a big lie.

4469
04:36:05,320 --> 04:36:06,620
What did you say?

4470
04:36:07,140 --> 04:36:08,840
It was really bothering me.

4471
04:36:09,320 --> 04:36:10,960
Why would she lie about it?

4472
04:36:11,140 --> 04:36:11,400
Hmm?

4473
04:36:11,420 --> 04:36:12,180
She lied?

4474
04:36:12,840 --> 04:36:14,140
She might be a spy.

4475
04:36:14,380 --> 04:36:14,620
Ridiculous.

4476
04:36:14,620 --> 04:36:15,120
I believed?

4477
04:36:15,560 --> 04:36:15,960
She lied?

4478
04:36:15,960 --> 04:36:19,380
Even a high school student could see past it.

4479
04:36:19,660 --> 04:36:22,160
Didn't Naomi say that her father was Japanese?

4480
04:36:22,400 --> 04:36:22,680
Mm-hmm.

4481
04:36:23,300 --> 04:36:28,340
At the time when Edgar Hoover was head of the FBI, there
wasn't a single Asian investigator.

4482
04:36:29,000 --> 04:36:33,600
Also, in the 50s, the undercover mafia sting operations
hadn't even started.

4483
04:36:33,740 --> 04:36:34,300
Oh my God.

4484
04:36:34,440 --> 04:36:38,440
They first started in 1960 in Chicago, not New York.

4485
04:36:38,700 --> 04:36:40,180
You better check it out.

4486
04:36:40,860 --> 04:36:43,620
The chief and the president mysteriously died.

4487
04:36:44,220 --> 04:36:44,660
That ninja.

4488
04:36:45,500 --> 04:36:45,940
Two men.

4489
04:36:47,160 --> 04:36:49,000
Her last name being Hunter?

4490
04:36:49,120 --> 04:36:50,700
Are you saying that Naomi might be behind it?

4491
04:36:52,060 --> 04:36:55,020
And Cyborg Ninja being Frank Yeager?

4492
04:36:58,020 --> 04:36:58,540
Masaka.

4493
04:36:59,060 --> 04:36:59,900
I'll call.

4494
04:37:00,320 --> 04:37:02,640
In the meantime, be careful.

4495
04:37:03,580 --> 04:37:04,400
Thanks, Master Miller.

4496
04:37:04,560 --> 04:37:06,160
You're the only one who has my back.

4497
04:37:07,080 --> 04:37:08,620
Gosh, Master Miller, you're so cool.

4498
04:37:09,260 --> 04:37:11,140
You're really the only one that has my back.

4499
04:37:36,580 --> 04:37:37,460
He's asleep.

4500
04:37:38,320 --> 04:37:39,100
Wait, what if I get one?

4501
04:37:39,120 --> 04:37:40,120
one in the sky.

4502
04:37:51,080 --> 04:37:51,720
Burn!

4503
04:37:51,900 --> 04:37:52,720
I'm sorry!

4504
04:37:58,310 --> 04:37:59,810
Oh, it's getting cold.

4505
04:38:00,650 --> 04:38:03,890
I'm chilly, I'm chilly, I'm chilly.

4506
04:38:03,890 --> 04:38:10,330
I'm chilly, I'm

4507
04:38:18,800 --> 04:38:18,800
chilly.

4508
04:38:19,120 --> 04:38:19,760
Nice.

4509
04:38:20,100 --> 04:38:20,300
Okay.

4510
04:38:27,390 --> 04:38:28,090
Let's save.

4511
04:38:28,410 --> 04:38:29,590
Oh, let's call people too.

4512
04:38:31,310 --> 04:38:31,590
Okay.

4513
04:38:32,210 --> 04:38:32,530
Okay.

4514
04:38:33,530 --> 04:38:35,370
Colonel, where's Naomi?

4515
04:38:35,750 --> 04:38:36,010
Me out.

4516
04:38:36,810 --> 04:38:38,950
Um, Naomi, I have some questions for you.

4517
04:38:39,110 --> 04:38:39,270
Nothing.

4518
04:38:39,650 --> 04:38:39,990
Forget it.

4519
04:38:40,050 --> 04:38:40,570
Actually, not you.

4520
04:38:40,710 --> 04:38:41,170
That's strange.

4521
04:38:41,370 --> 04:38:41,530
Just kidding.

4522
04:38:42,610 --> 04:38:45,690
Snake, by now those terrorists have finished their launch
operations.

4523
04:38:46,470 --> 04:38:47,350
Stop wasting time.

4524
04:38:47,410 --> 04:38:48,110
I'm not wasting time.

4525
04:38:48,290 --> 04:38:49,670
Metal Gear's base is up ahead.

4526
04:38:50,110 --> 04:38:52,490
Snake, it's over 30 below outside.

4527
04:38:53,810 --> 04:38:54,130
Yeah.

4528
04:38:54,350 --> 04:38:54,790
What's wrong?

4529
04:38:54,870 --> 04:38:55,630
I don't want to talk to you.

4530
04:38:55,810 --> 04:38:55,990
Forget it.

4531
04:38:56,450 --> 04:38:56,750
Thanks.

4532
04:38:58,990 --> 04:38:59,810
Snap, pap.

4533
04:39:00,030 --> 04:39:03,430
Stop lollygagging around and get to Metal Gear's Sorry.

4534
04:39:04,250 --> 04:39:04,710
Sorry.

4535
04:39:04,990 --> 04:39:05,890
Sorry, Colonel.

4536
04:39:06,050 --> 04:39:06,610
Oh my gosh.

4537
04:39:08,270 --> 04:39:10,130
Master Miller, I'm so worried about her.

4538
04:39:10,330 --> 04:39:11,610
I want to ask you about Naomi.

4539
04:39:11,970 --> 04:39:12,210
Yeah.

4540
04:39:12,510 --> 04:39:16,250
I'm looking into the details now, but it doesn't look good.

4541
04:39:16,890 --> 04:39:18,470
I like how her mouth went.

4542
04:39:19,170 --> 04:39:20,570
Even though nothing came out.

4543
04:39:21,230 --> 04:39:23,450
Snake, keep your guard up.

4544
04:39:23,650 --> 04:39:25,890
You're the only one I could trust, Master Miller.

4545
04:39:26,030 --> 04:39:27,370
You're the only one I could trust.

4546
04:39:28,670 --> 04:39:29,650
Oh my gosh.

4547
04:39:30,210 --> 04:39:30,970
Very subtle, Snake.

4548
04:39:30,970 --> 04:39:32,530
What the hell are all these crows doing around you?

4549
04:39:33,530 --> 04:39:41,050
crows you got me there were crows around from before but for
some reason they started to increase in number about the

4550
04:39:41,050 --> 04:39:54,390
same time that Foxhound came to the base mmm it's really
weird I wonder what it could mean I don't know I wonder if

4551
04:39:54,390 --> 04:40:00,810
we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled
nuclear weapons it's going to become easier and easier for

4552
04:40:00,810 --> 04:40:05,570
terrorists to get their hands on them Sorry, it's just
really funny that everyone's like talking about Naomi and

4553
04:40:05,570 --> 04:40:08,690
she's like, the soul, we need to get rid of some of this
stuff.

4554
04:40:08,990 --> 04:40:13,750
Reducing their nuclear stockpiles to a core deterrent force
of less than 500 missiles each.

4555
04:40:14,370 --> 04:40:20,170
And declaring that there would be no nuclear counter-strike
in the event of the use of conventional or chemical weapons.

4556
04:40:20,830 --> 04:40:21,870
But talks fell through.

4557
04:40:22,530 --> 04:40:27,970
It seems that America is unwilling to relinquish its
position as the most powerful country in the world.

4558
04:40:29,290 --> 04:40:30,250
The pride.

4559
04:40:30,690 --> 04:40:31,150
Pride.

4560
04:40:32,550 --> 04:40:47,310
in the how's Naomi huh she's fine I guess what's up if you
want to talk to Naomi why don't you call her yeah I guess so

4561
04:40:47,310 --> 04:41:03,330
strange guy strange guy shy guy shy boy strange boy boys are
weird USA USA USA Good luck, Snake.

4562
04:41:05,270 --> 04:41:07,190
About to go fight another person.

4563
04:41:07,870 --> 04:41:08,330
Oh, wow.

4564
04:41:09,030 --> 04:41:10,390
It's a good thing we walked through there.

4565
04:41:10,510 --> 04:41:11,510
We would have been crushed.

4566
04:41:11,830 --> 04:41:12,810
Like a little ant.

4567
04:41:15,870 --> 04:41:16,150
Okay.

4568
04:41:23,200 --> 04:41:24,220
What's that?

4569
04:41:28,720 --> 04:41:30,360
Oh my god, they're eating here.

4570
04:41:31,020 --> 04:41:32,220
Then they're gonna eat me.

4571
04:41:33,560 --> 04:41:35,340
Oh my god.

4572
04:41:43,520 --> 04:41:44,860
Welcome, Cossack.

4573
04:41:46,040 --> 04:41:47,480
What'd you call me?

4574
04:41:58,560 --> 04:42:03,480
This is the end of the road for you, right my friends?

4575
04:42:05,620 --> 04:42:07,280
Kaka, kaka, yeah!

4576
04:42:07,840 --> 04:42:09,600
Me too.

4577
04:42:12,360 --> 04:42:15,460
Ravens aren't scavengers like most people think.

4578
04:42:17,020 --> 04:42:25,660
They're simply returning to the natural world that which is
no longer needed sometimes they even attack wounded foxes

4579
04:42:25,660 --> 04:42:37,620
well i'm a snake you were the one in the m1 tank must have
been a tight fit for a big boy like you i love but that is

4580
04:42:37,620 --> 04:42:38,800
no true battle

4581
04:42:43,260 --> 04:42:51,140
isn't he freezing no he's a big boy I love that line so
much.

4582
04:42:54,540 --> 04:42:54,960
What?

4583
04:42:54,960 --> 04:42:56,580
The judgment is decided.

4584
04:42:57,480 --> 04:42:59,940
The Ravens say you are a true warrior.

4585
04:43:08,770 --> 04:43:10,090
Snake, you're hallucinating.

4586
04:43:10,690 --> 04:43:11,410
Yes, you are.

4587
04:43:12,770 --> 04:43:13,210
Snake?

4588
04:43:14,150 --> 04:43:15,930
I can't move.

4589
04:43:17,090 --> 04:43:17,430
What?

4590
04:43:17,690 --> 04:43:18,110
What?

4591
04:43:18,130 --> 04:43:22,290
The raven has put the mark of death upon you.

4592
04:43:25,490 --> 04:43:28,650
Blood from the east flows within your veins.

4593
04:43:33,110 --> 04:43:37,730
Ah, your ancestors too were raised on the barren plains of
Mongolia.

4594
04:43:39,190 --> 04:43:40,110
Psycho-Mintus.

4595
04:43:40,290 --> 04:43:43,470
Inuit and Japanese are cousins to each other.

4596
04:43:44,210 --> 04:43:46,930
We share many ancestors, you and I.

4597
04:43:48,150 --> 04:43:50,150
There's no crows in Mongolia.

4598
04:43:50,170 --> 04:43:51,180
My family tree.

4599
04:43:52,630 --> 04:43:53,910
You ready?

4600
04:43:54,750 --> 04:43:54,890
Yep.

4601
04:43:54,890 --> 04:43:59,270
I am not fond of snakes, but you are family, so I cannot
complain.

4602
04:43:59,710 --> 04:44:01,700
But there will be no holding back.

4603
04:44:02,990 --> 04:44:03,850
Snakes a Japanese princess.

4604
04:44:04,270 --> 04:44:04,650
Wow!

4605
04:44:05,530 --> 04:44:08,670
It reminds me of Nonomi from Blue Archive.

4606
04:44:10,350 --> 04:44:13,190
I need Vulcan Raven Nonomi art together.

4607
04:44:13,730 --> 04:44:15,510
You live in Alaska too.

4608
04:44:15,910 --> 04:44:18,950
You know of the world Eskimo Indian Olympics.

4609
04:44:20,170 --> 04:44:20,510
Olympics?

4610
04:44:21,190 --> 04:44:25,870
With that strength, you must have been training in the stick
pull and four-man carry.

4611
04:44:27,310 --> 04:44:28,310
Yes, you are right.

4612
04:44:28,670 --> 04:44:31,010
But there is another event that I excelled.

4613
04:44:31,030 --> 04:44:33,170
But actually, Snake's mom is Japanese.

4614
04:44:34,230 --> 04:44:36,050
It is called the ear pull.

4615
04:44:36,510 --> 04:44:36,870
Wow.

4616
04:44:37,610 --> 04:44:43,170
It's an event where two opponents pull each other's ears
while enduring the harsh cold.

4617
04:44:43,190 --> 04:44:44,370
This is the worst thing ever.

4618
04:44:44,670 --> 04:44:47,230
It tests spiritual as well as physical strength.

4619
04:44:47,710 --> 04:44:49,630
You want to pull each other's ears?

4620
04:44:50,170 --> 04:44:53,410
The form is different, but the spirit is the same.

4621
04:44:53,990 --> 04:44:54,970
Rejoice, Snake.

4622
04:44:55,630 --> 04:44:57,710
Ours will be a glorious battle.

4623
04:44:59,130 --> 04:45:01,130
The thought of Katori for Nonomi because of her hair.

4624
04:45:01,290 --> 04:45:02,630
Oh, I see it.

4625
04:45:02,890 --> 04:45:03,790
It's just plain killing.

4626
04:45:03,930 --> 04:45:04,410
I never thought of it.

4627
04:45:04,690 --> 04:45:05,710
Violence isn't a sport.

4628
04:45:07,590 --> 04:45:12,010
Well, we will see if there is iron in your words.

4629
04:45:12,270 --> 04:45:12,630
Oh, yeah.

4630
04:45:12,730 --> 04:45:13,930
I take supplements every day.

4631
04:45:18,330 --> 04:45:20,090
Oh, what is going on?

4632
04:45:20,170 --> 04:45:22,450
Oh, he's got that iron grip.

4633
04:45:23,190 --> 04:45:23,210
Oh.

4634
04:45:24,270 --> 04:45:24,590
Oh.

4635
04:45:25,890 --> 04:45:26,570
What?

4636
04:45:27,890 --> 04:45:28,290
What?

4637
04:45:33,900 --> 04:45:35,280
Oh, my God.

4638
04:45:41,320 --> 04:45:42,000
Stop.

4639
04:45:43,480 --> 04:45:45,800
Stop, he did not just blow it up with...

4640
04:45:45,800 --> 04:45:46,180
No.

4641
04:45:49,100 --> 04:45:50,480
Oh, my God.

4642
04:45:52,580 --> 04:45:55,320
He just threw a whole container at him.

4643
04:45:55,600 --> 04:45:56,820
And Snake stopped it.

4644
04:45:56,840 --> 04:45:59,100
Once again, by blowing it up with missiles.

4645
04:46:01,220 --> 04:46:02,120
Oh, no, sorry.

4646
04:46:02,260 --> 04:46:03,300
The first time was a grenade.

4647
04:46:04,260 --> 04:46:05,160
Oh, my God.

4648
04:46:06,240 --> 04:46:07,080
Oh, my God.

4649
04:46:07,180 --> 04:46:08,720
Blast radius doesn't exist.

4650
04:46:09,000 --> 04:46:10,680
Not for solid snake.

4651
04:46:13,480 --> 04:46:14,640
Oh, my God.

4652
04:46:14,740 --> 04:46:15,600
That thing is huge.

4653
04:46:15,800 --> 04:46:16,580
Snake, how did...

4654
04:46:16,580 --> 04:46:16,920
How...

4655
04:46:17,440 --> 04:46:20,800
Oh, but if I do it...

4656
04:46:20,800 --> 04:46:23,280
If I do it, I get blown up, you know?

4657
04:46:25,520 --> 04:46:35,700
Like, if there's cutscenes, buff then it's fine hey get out
of here crow you're gonna get shot at oh oh he's yelling at

4658
04:46:35,700 --> 04:46:43,400

4659
04:46:47,170 --> 04:46:51,110

4660
04:46:57,090 --> 04:47:03,050
missed okay so there is a way to like kind of cheese this
where you can just shoot him in the back of the head

4661
04:47:03,050 --> 04:47:07,430
constantly oh well i missed Oh, hold on.

4662
04:47:11,460 --> 04:47:13,200
I un-equipped my gun, so I'm stupid.

4663
04:47:13,760 --> 04:47:14,820
Oh, I missed him.

4664
04:47:28,230 --> 04:47:28,850
Let's see.

4665
04:47:29,410 --> 04:47:29,850
You know what?

4666
04:47:29,890 --> 04:47:30,430
Maybe I won't.

4667
04:47:30,510 --> 04:47:31,730
Maybe I'll just do it with the Nikita.

4668
04:47:33,290 --> 04:47:34,350
Maybe I will just Nikita.

4669
04:47:40,240 --> 04:47:41,180
Where is he, though?

4670
04:47:41,360 --> 04:47:42,390
Oh, I think he is.

4671
04:47:51,170 --> 04:47:51,510
Phew!

4672
04:47:52,350 --> 04:47:52,750
Oh my god.

4673
04:48:02,740 --> 04:48:02,900
Ow.

4674
04:48:03,580 --> 04:48:03,600
Ouch!

4675
04:48:18,950 --> 04:48:19,770
Oh, no, no, no.

4676
04:48:19,970 --> 04:48:20,190
Ah!

4677
04:48:22,150 --> 04:48:22,870
You jerk.

4678
04:48:25,050 --> 04:48:26,330
You have a big gun.

4679
04:48:43,920 --> 04:48:45,440
Actually, I don't know where he is.

4680
04:48:46,860 --> 04:48:47,240
Actually...

4681
04:48:47,240 --> 04:48:48,400
Oh, he's over there.

4682
04:48:49,420 --> 04:48:49,800
Somewhere.

4683
04:48:50,600 --> 04:48:51,160
There he is.

4684
04:48:53,720 --> 04:48:54,480
Did that work?

4685
04:48:55,280 --> 04:48:55,620
Oh my god.

4686
04:48:55,940 --> 04:48:56,100
Wait.

4687
04:48:56,380 --> 04:48:57,020
Oh, he's coming.

4688
04:49:04,540 --> 04:49:06,040
I just used the stinger.

4689
04:49:06,740 --> 04:49:07,440
I guess that's fair.

4690
04:49:07,660 --> 04:49:08,940
But I think you blow it up, right?

4691
04:49:11,120 --> 04:49:14,520
Like, there is a way to just, like, Literally shoot him like
this.

4692
04:49:15,620 --> 04:49:16,460
Oh, he's running?

4693
04:49:17,640 --> 04:49:18,320
He's so fast?

4694
04:49:18,900 --> 04:49:19,400
He's so furious?

4695
04:49:20,520 --> 04:49:21,720
Oh, he's really fast.

4696
04:49:22,260 --> 04:49:22,800
Hey buddy.

4697
04:49:25,440 --> 04:49:27,060
What are you- you're wasting your bullets?

4698
04:49:31,430 --> 04:49:31,770
Oops.

4699
04:49:34,490 --> 04:49:35,210
Pull his ear.

4700
04:49:35,810 --> 04:49:36,670
Pull his ear!

4701
04:49:37,870 --> 04:49:39,630
Let's try the- we can try the Stinger.

4702
04:49:40,990 --> 04:49:41,190
Oh.

4703
04:49:41,770 --> 04:49:43,290
He's- he's breathing heavy.

4704
04:49:44,790 --> 04:49:45,510
Oh my god.

4705
04:49:45,730 --> 04:49:46,190
Wait, there's...

4706
04:49:46,990 --> 04:49:48,090
Oh my god, it's...

4707
04:49:49,210 --> 04:49:52,010
It's like focusing in on all the crows too.

4708
04:49:52,770 --> 04:49:53,510
No way.

4709
04:49:53,610 --> 04:49:54,470
That's so funny.

4710
04:49:57,090 --> 04:49:57,530
Uh...

4711
04:49:59,130 --> 04:50:01,530
Let's just stand right here and, um,

4712
04:50:05,390 --> 04:50:05,830
where'd he go?

4713
04:50:06,130 --> 04:50:06,730
Oh, there he is.

4714
04:50:07,210 --> 04:50:08,350
Uh-oh, he's gonna see me.

4715
04:50:08,630 --> 04:50:08,930
Ah!

4716
04:50:13,750 --> 04:50:14,790
I'm gonna use this.

4717
04:50:15,010 --> 04:50:16,630
Now I'm gonna switch the body over here.

4718
04:50:18,190 --> 04:50:18,910
Oh my god.

4719
04:50:19,790 --> 04:50:22,870
Why are you heavy breathing so much Stop, you're scaring me!

4720
04:50:40,680 --> 04:50:42,660
I heard that this fight was so much easier.

4721
04:50:42,840 --> 04:50:42,960
Oh.

4722
04:50:44,720 --> 04:50:45,220
Oh my god.

4723
04:50:45,960 --> 04:50:47,480
It was so much easier in this one.

4724
04:50:47,760 --> 04:50:49,340
And I mean, all the fights pretty much are.

4725
04:50:50,780 --> 04:50:51,100
But...

4726
04:50:52,100 --> 04:50:53,540
I want to try and do the cheese.

4727
04:50:54,040 --> 04:50:55,460
Wait, oh, maybe I can do it here.

4728
04:51:00,160 --> 04:51:00,660
Oh, shoot.

4729
04:51:00,980 --> 04:51:01,120
Ah!

4730
04:51:01,340 --> 04:51:01,500
Ah!

4731
04:51:01,660 --> 04:51:02,020
Hold on!

4732
04:51:02,380 --> 04:51:03,180
Oh my god, please.

4733
04:51:07,320 --> 04:51:08,420
As long as I don't die.

4734
04:51:08,580 --> 04:51:09,000
Oh my god.

4735
04:51:09,820 --> 04:51:11,240
Maybe I have to get him in the head.

4736
04:51:17,550 --> 04:51:18,230
Stop shooting me!

4737
04:51:23,330 --> 04:51:24,290
I take a couple hits.

4738
04:51:24,650 --> 04:51:25,830
You take a couple hits.

4739
04:51:26,390 --> 04:51:27,590
It works out this way.

4740
04:51:32,050 --> 04:51:33,150
I take a couple hits.

4741
04:51:33,730 --> 04:51:34,750
You take a couple hits.

4742
04:51:35,570 --> 04:51:37,550
I'm just a little tankier than him, you guys.

4743
04:51:43,590 --> 04:51:44,930
Body armor for the win.

4744
04:51:45,050 --> 04:51:45,710
For real.

4745
04:51:50,950 --> 04:52:03,950

4753
04:53:19,750 --> 04:53:22,950
The man you saw die before your eyes.

4754
04:53:26,150 --> 04:53:28,870
Yeah, oh yeah, the diaper chief.

4755
04:53:29,070 --> 04:53:30,810
That was not the DARPA chief.

4756
04:53:31,010 --> 04:53:31,530
What?

4757
04:53:33,250 --> 04:53:34,230
Who was it?

4758
04:53:34,890 --> 04:53:36,590
It was Decoy Octopus.

4759
04:53:36,730 --> 04:53:37,510
No!

4760
04:53:38,890 --> 04:53:40,150
Oh no!

4761
04:53:40,150 --> 04:53:41,030
No!

4762
04:53:46,170 --> 04:53:47,910
We never got to fight!

4763
04:53:48,110 --> 04:53:49,230
Decoy Octopus!

4764
04:53:50,410 --> 04:53:51,150
No way.

4765
04:53:51,170 --> 04:53:52,830
He was a master of disguise.

4766
04:53:53,610 --> 04:53:54,430
Wait, did we get to see him?

4767
04:53:54,670 --> 04:53:57,310
He copied his subjects down to the blood.

4768
04:53:57,730 --> 04:53:57,990
Stop!

4769
04:53:58,470 --> 04:54:01,070
So he drained the chief's blood and took it into himself.

4770
04:54:01,210 --> 04:54:02,810
We actually get to see Decoy Octopus?

4771
04:54:03,230 --> 04:54:06,450
But he wasn't able to deceive the angel of death.

4772
04:54:06,590 --> 04:54:07,870
Thought he was about to take off his pants.

4773
04:54:12,930 --> 04:54:23,250
that's awesome we actually get to see him ah that's me i'm
the angel of death but why go to so much trouble why

4774
04:54:23,250 --> 04:54:24,350
impersonate the chief

4775
04:54:28,010 --> 04:54:39,870
that is the end of my hint you must solve the rest of the
riddle yourself yeah what questions were is he asking me he

4776
04:54:39,870 --> 04:54:44,230
was asking He's asking a lot of questions to me, you know,
when I, uh, when I met him.

4777
04:54:46,630 --> 04:54:47,030
Voldemort.

4778
04:54:49,910 --> 04:54:53,030
How would the fight be with decoys since he only knows how
to disguise himself?

4779
04:54:53,350 --> 04:54:54,670
He could disguise himself as the wall.

4780
04:54:54,810 --> 04:54:56,950
It's like hide and seek, you know, you have to go find him.

4781
04:55:04,290 --> 04:55:04,690
Hebio.

4782
04:55:10,340 --> 04:55:11,460
They're eating him!

4783
04:55:13,880 --> 04:55:14,600
Oh, God.

4784
04:55:14,800 --> 04:55:16,000
Oh, it's really nasty.

4785
04:55:20,200 --> 04:55:21,580
Oh, gross.

4786
04:55:25,040 --> 04:55:29,440
In the natural world, there is no such thing as boundless
slaughter.

4787
04:55:32,760 --> 04:55:36,520
There is always an end to it, but you are different.

4788
04:55:37,380 --> 04:55:38,040
He looks a fool.

4789
04:55:38,080 --> 04:55:38,960
What are you trying to say?

4790
04:55:40,280 --> 04:55:43,400
The path you walk on has no end.

4791
04:55:44,180 --> 04:56:00,380
No matter how far you go, or how many corpses, you crawl
over the killing will never end it's a future without hope I

4792
04:56:00,380 --> 04:56:11,100
hate how me snake oh laughing octopus my spirit will be
watching you Wow it was it was like a balloon there's

4793
04:56:11,100 --> 04:56:20,060
nothing to him it's really a sad how kind of true That ends
up being...

4794
04:56:23,750 --> 04:56:24,690
Poor Snake.

4795
04:56:25,450 --> 04:56:27,410
Snake has had a hard life.

4796
04:56:28,850 --> 04:56:29,830
No bones.

4797
04:56:31,350 --> 04:56:32,550
No bones.

4798
04:56:33,730 --> 04:56:35,870
Yeah, Raven wasn't wrong, unfortunately.

4799
04:56:37,570 --> 04:56:38,230
Snake, it's me.

4800
04:56:38,470 --> 04:56:38,870
The music?

4801
04:56:40,070 --> 04:56:40,870
It's about Naomi.

4802
04:56:41,450 --> 04:56:42,410
Turn your monitor off.

4803
04:56:43,030 --> 04:56:43,870
What about Naomi?

4804
04:56:45,790 --> 04:56:45,990
Wait!

4805
04:56:46,330 --> 04:56:46,530
Colonel!

4806
04:56:46,710 --> 04:56:47,550
Is Naomi there?

4807
04:56:48,030 --> 04:56:49,270
No, she's away.

4808
04:56:49,850 --> 04:56:50,790
She's taking a short time.

4809
04:56:50,810 --> 04:56:52,990
Oh, I wish I could take a short nap on the job.

4810
04:56:53,170 --> 04:56:54,490
So what is this about Naomi?

4811
04:56:55,450 --> 04:56:58,170
Okay, maybe we'd better let the Colonel hear this too.

4812
04:56:58,390 --> 04:56:58,550
Mm-hmm.

4813
04:56:58,810 --> 04:57:00,270
Yeah, go on, Master.

4814
04:57:00,750 --> 04:57:06,350
Well, basically, Dr. Naomi Hunter is not Dr. Naomi Hunter at
all.

4815
04:57:06,390 --> 04:57:06,790
What?

4816
04:57:06,870 --> 04:57:07,110
What?

4817
04:57:07,710 --> 04:57:10,810
I thought her story of her background sounded kind of fishy.

4818
04:57:10,990 --> 04:57:11,990
Yeah, so I checked it out.

4819
04:57:12,070 --> 04:57:12,590
I believe you.

4820
04:57:12,950 --> 04:57:13,270
And?

4821
04:57:13,810 --> 04:57:16,170
There is an actual Dr. Naomi Hunter.

4822
04:57:17,130 --> 04:57:18,750
Or I should say, there was one.

4823
04:57:18,770 --> 04:57:19,190
Skinwalker.

4824
04:57:19,370 --> 04:57:20,310
She took her body.

4825
04:57:20,810 --> 04:57:26,710
And we know the real Naomi hunter disappeared somewhere in
the middle she buried her in the sand Naomi must have

4826
04:57:26,710 --> 04:57:28,790
somehow obtained her identification papers.

4827
04:57:28,990 --> 04:57:29,270
Oh my gosh.

4828
04:57:29,510 --> 04:57:30,810
So then who is she really?

4829
04:57:31,390 --> 04:57:35,890
She must be some kind of spy a spy a spy a spy?

4830
04:57:36,870 --> 04:57:39,310
Maybe she's been sent to sabotage this operation.

4831
04:57:39,730 --> 04:57:41,290
Are you saying she's with the terrorists?

4832
04:57:41,410 --> 04:57:41,650
Oh my god.

4833
04:57:41,810 --> 04:57:42,090
Oh my god.

4834
04:57:42,330 --> 04:57:45,590
I don't want to believe it either But she is working for
Foxhound.

4835
04:57:46,250 --> 04:57:49,570
So you think she had a part in the uprising?

4836
04:57:50,810 --> 04:57:53,690
She could be working with some different group all together.

4837
04:57:53,910 --> 04:57:55,670
How do you know I have a sad group?

4838
04:57:56,770 --> 04:58:00,070
it couldn't be Place her under arrest Colonel.

4839
04:58:00,250 --> 04:58:02,830
Yeah, she's betrayed us Colonel.

4840
04:58:03,190 --> 04:58:10,350
Yeah, she needs to be arrested and interrogated to find out
who she's with Yeah, she's one of their spies and we're in

4841
04:58:10,350 --> 04:58:11,090
big trouble.

4842
04:58:11,290 --> 04:58:13,850
She what have you what have you told her Colonel?

4843
04:58:15,290 --> 04:58:19,770
Oh, nothing Have you let her in on some kind of vital secret
or something?

4844
04:58:20,110 --> 04:58:20,310
Uh-oh.

4845
04:58:20,710 --> 04:58:27,690
Oh Does this have anything to do with the mysterious deaths
of the DARPA chief and the arms tech president?

4846
04:58:27,970 --> 04:58:30,350
I have no idea.

4847
04:58:30,350 --> 04:58:33,910
Oh, Colonel, that is the least convincing answer I've ever
heard in my life.

4848
04:58:34,430 --> 04:58:35,690
Any further in this mission.

4849
04:58:35,990 --> 04:58:37,390
Wait, wait a minute.

4850
04:58:38,150 --> 04:58:40,730
Without her, we can't complete this mission.

4851
04:58:40,830 --> 04:58:42,850
Had been really ties her out for together perfectly.

4852
04:58:43,410 --> 04:58:43,830
Thank you!

4853
04:58:43,870 --> 04:58:44,550
Give me some time.

4854
04:58:44,730 --> 04:58:46,110
Have a good rest of your night.

4855
04:58:46,370 --> 04:58:47,070
Alan, thank you.

4856
04:58:47,110 --> 04:58:47,830
Island, sorry.

4857
04:58:48,370 --> 04:58:48,570
Thank you.

4858
04:58:50,810 --> 04:58:51,630

4859
04:58:51,950 --> 04:58:52,570
I understand.

4860
04:58:53,650 --> 04:58:55,230
Snake, give me some time.

4861
04:58:55,370 --> 04:58:57,610
I don't have any time left for you.

4862
04:58:57,730 --> 04:58:59,270
Oh, yeah, you tell him, Snake!

4863
04:58:59,590 --> 04:59:00,530
You tell him!

4864
04:59:01,130 --> 04:59:01,990
Oh my gosh.

4865
04:59:02,270 --> 04:59:03,210
Master Miller.

4866
04:59:05,810 --> 04:59:06,930
What's that sound?

4867
04:59:10,330 --> 04:59:11,130
Be ready?

4868
04:59:16,740 --> 04:59:18,960
I got his dog tags!

4869
04:59:19,180 --> 04:59:20,080
Vulcan Raven!

4870
04:59:22,000 --> 04:59:31,000
Wait, oh, could I have gotten Psycho Mantises two I wonder
oh no that's a shame I didn't get it because I didn't know

4871
04:59:31,000 --> 04:59:35,560
it's so chilly in here oh let's

4872
04:59:40,870 --> 04:59:44,110
put the body armor back on I

4873
04:59:51,810 --> 04:59:58,970
don't see anything else maybe I think maybe we're okay have
you ever listened to all the snake codec calls from smash

4874
04:59:58,970 --> 05:00:06,550
bros if not it would be a very fun watch I have seen a good
amount of them I don't remember if I watched like a

4875
05:00:06,550 --> 05:00:13,870
compilation of all of them or if I finished that compilation
if I watched one, but I have seen some, yes.

4876
05:00:15,250 --> 05:00:16,890
Miller's the only honest guy in this game.

4877
05:00:17,170 --> 05:00:17,590
Truly.

4878
05:00:22,390 --> 05:00:24,510
I remember you.

4879
05:00:28,050 --> 05:00:29,790
I remember you.

4880
05:00:33,030 --> 05:00:35,370
I, I remember you.

4881
05:00:37,670 --> 05:00:39,750
Check, check your rations.

4882
05:00:40,670 --> 05:00:42,050
I do need that, don't I?

4883
05:00:43,930 --> 05:00:44,610
Wait a second.

4884
05:00:44,730 --> 05:00:45,910
Is that a person and not?

4885
05:00:48,210 --> 05:00:49,730
Wait, is there a person here?

4886
05:00:49,990 --> 05:00:51,070
I think I saw it turn around.

4887
05:00:52,470 --> 05:00:53,270
This room never...

4888
05:00:53,270 --> 05:00:55,950
I think there's an actual person in here.

4889
05:00:59,920 --> 05:01:00,820
Oh my god, there is.

4890
05:01:00,980 --> 05:01:01,440
Oh my god.

4891
05:01:01,580 --> 05:01:02,620
You scared me.

4892
05:01:05,420 --> 05:01:06,360
You scared me.

4893
05:01:09,480 --> 05:01:10,880
There never was a person in here.

4894
05:01:10,960 --> 05:01:11,500
Oh, cool.

4895
05:01:19,510 --> 05:01:32,430
Oh, oh my god, uh, uh, oh shoot, oh my god, uh, uh, oh

It's him, give me some backup, Robin, no!

4897
05:01:37,570 --> 05:01:48,420
Oh my god, oh shoot, um, I thought the cameras were the only
issue here, and suddenly they're adding people,

4898
05:01:52,680 --> 05:01:53,380
Oh my god.

4899
05:01:54,120 --> 05:01:54,780
Oh my god.

4900
05:01:54,900 --> 05:01:55,680
I'm also trying to shoot.

4901
05:01:56,200 --> 05:01:57,420
I'm also trying to shoot.

4902
05:02:03,800 --> 05:02:05,240
Uh, oh, uh, hi.

4903
05:02:05,940 --> 05:02:07,320
Uh, ouch.

05:02:10,270 --> 05:02:10,810
Oh my god, please.

4905
05:02:10,950 --> 05:02:11,090
Snake.

4906
05:02:11,850 --> 05:02:12,170
There we go.

4907
05:02:12,470 --> 05:02:12,730
Anyway.

4908
05:02:16,360 --> 05:02:17,760
You trapped his car.

4909
05:02:19,820 --> 05:02:21,880
Oh, that's why he ran into there.

4910
05:02:25,890 --> 05:02:26,310
Zum.

4911
05:02:28,670 --> 05:02:29,130

05:03:55,210 --> 05:03:55,530
ZUM.

4927
05:03:56,650 --> 05:03:58,030

4928
05:03:59,550 --> 05:04:00,330
Lame ass.

4929
05:04:01,310 --> 05:04:01,750
Soundtrack.

4930
05:04:04,050 --> 05:04:06,610
Worst part of the... Worst part of the game is the
soundtrack, truly.

4931
05:04:08,650 --> 05:04:10,310
Wait, is there someone actually down here?

4932
05:04:11,530 --> 05:04:12,690
Oh, no, he's above me.

4933
05:04:15,310 --> 05:04:15,750

I love Metal Gear!

4941
05:04:36,570 --> 05:04:38,430
Oh, thanks to the stealth gear.

4942
05:04:38,570 --> 05:04:38,970
I got stuff to do.

4943
05:04:39,070 --> 05:04:39,710
I'll get you on the reruns.

4944
05:04:40,570 --> 05:04:41,190
Love ya.

4945
05:04:41,290 --> 05:04:42,170
Thanks, A.V.

4946
05:04:42,570 --> 05:04:43,610
Good luck with your stuff.

4947
05:04:43,770 --> 05:04:44,350
I overheard them talking.

4948
05:04:45,370 --> 05:04:47,930
The music in this version seems very subdued.

4949
05:04:48,470 --> 05:04:49,770
Yeah, it is very absent.

4950
05:04:49,950 --> 05:04:50,050
Yeah.

4951
05:04:50,750 --> 05:04:51,850
There's nobody here.

4952
05:04:52,290 --> 05:04:52,950
No guards.

4953
05:04:53,210 --> 05:04:53,870
No mechanics.

4954
05:04:54,730 --> 05:04:55,710
It's too quiet.

4955
05:04:56,330 --> 05:04:57,270
There's some guards.

4956
05:04:57,950 --> 05:04:58,490
There's some guards.

4957
05:04:58,670 --> 05:05:00,410
They said they even input the PAL codes.

4958
05:05:01,110 --> 05:05:01,850
What should I do?

4959
05:05:01,910 --> 05:05:02,470
Oh my god, no.

4960
05:05:02,490 --> 05:05:06,170
All we can do is use the override system that President
Baker told you about.

4961
05:05:06,570 --> 05:05:06,990
override.

4962
05:05:06,990 --> 05:05:13,510
I've only got one of the three keys and besides that like
Ocelot said there's some trick to using the keys.

4963
05:05:14,010 --> 05:05:14,490
Leave it to me.

4964
05:05:14,610 --> 05:05:18,050
There's also actually an easier way here too which is kind
of nice.

4965
05:05:18,130 --> 05:05:22,070
I'm in the computer room right now I'm trying to access
Baker's private files.

4966
05:05:22,450 --> 05:05:22,450
Okay.

4967
05:05:22,730 --> 05:05:23,330
Baker's files.

4968
05:05:23,790 --> 05:05:24,750
Don't you need a password?

4969
05:05:25,350 --> 05:05:25,590
Of course.

4970
05:05:26,450 --> 05:05:28,150
But there are ways.

4971
05:05:29,390 --> 05:05:30,510
Are you a hacker?

4972
05:05:31,190 --> 05:05:40,010
Yep that describes me pretty well are you a hacker i don't
know yet i'll give it a try i'm hacking to the gate

4973
05:05:45,510 --> 05:05:55,970
where are the guards you said there's guards literally right
above me i

4974
05:06:00,410 --> 05:06:05,510
think wait what up where is it huh

4975
05:06:09,580 --> 05:06:10,860
Actually, where is the guard?

4976
05:06:14,500 --> 05:06:16,500
I heard someone walking, though.

4977
05:06:17,120 --> 05:06:17,680
Are they one above?

4978
05:06:20,260 --> 05:06:21,400
Oh, uh-oh.

4979
05:06:21,580 --> 05:06:22,340
Is there somebody there?

4980
05:06:22,640 --> 05:06:23,500
Oh, oh, oh.

4981
05:06:23,700 --> 05:06:24,000
Ah!

4982
05:06:26,080 --> 05:06:26,960
Oh, my God.

4983
05:06:27,960 --> 05:06:28,640
Oh, gosh.

4984
05:06:29,000 --> 05:06:30,580
I didn't see your stupid ass.

4985
05:06:31,940 --> 05:06:33,020
Oh, my God.

4986
05:06:56,480 --> 05:06:58,000
Snake, it's me again.

4987
05:06:58,100 --> 05:06:58,980
No guards at all.

4988
05:06:59,080 --> 05:06:59,900
Yeah, it's so weird.

4989
05:07:00,000 --> 05:07:00,300
There was no guards.

4990
05:07:00,320 --> 05:07:07,580
guards in this part before i just got past his third
security level he was a pretty careful guy do you think

4991
05:07:07,580 --> 05:07:15,800
you'll break in soon i've never met a system i couldn't bust
i couldn't even see where he was coming from man man this oh

4992
05:07:15,800 --> 05:07:27,760
uh uh we're both loading at the same time but i'm faster oh
my god no no he's not you

4993
05:07:32,200 --> 05:07:35,400
know your stupid shield where's my shield Oh my god.

4994
05:07:37,640 --> 05:07:41,660
Okay, now I can run and hide.

4995
05:07:43,880 --> 05:07:44,620
Where's my box?

4996
05:07:45,360 --> 05:07:45,880
Snow box.

4997
05:07:50,440 --> 05:07:53,040
I saw people running up, but they're gonna see me, aren't
they?

4998
05:07:53,200 --> 05:07:54,020
Aren't they gonna see me?

4999
05:08:00,790 --> 05:08:01,970
They're gonna see me, aren't they?

5000
05:08:03,170 --> 05:08:03,790
They're gonna see me!

5001
05:08:05,390 --> 05:08:06,510
Do you think I can walk?

5002
05:08:08,970 --> 05:08:09,330
Okay.

5003
05:08:11,530 --> 05:08:22,550
that in I could have just I should have just stayed here
okay we'll just wait until the caution's over can

5004
05:08:28,140 --> 05:08:38,380
I see them in there I don't see them they're just like
probably being like what's going on down there nothing much

5005
05:08:38,380 --> 05:08:50,900
don't worry about it why would you need to worry about it
you know middle of a hallway I didn't know where this left

5006
05:08:50,900 --> 05:09:03,280
led to yeah oh my god oh my god oh wait hold on oh oh wait
wait wait oh

5007
05:09:11,850 --> 05:09:27,640
my god what I tried to be sighted remember what no I shot
your everything I shot your thing this

5008
05:09:35,350 --> 05:09:35,990
is so unfair.

5009
05:09:37,630 --> 05:09:38,350
It's so unfair.

5010
05:09:39,170 --> 05:09:39,790
It's so unfair.

5011
05:09:40,730 --> 05:09:41,410
This is so unfair.

5012
05:09:42,670 --> 05:09:43,830
I shot the radio!

5013
05:09:46,750 --> 05:09:47,370
I...

5014
05:09:47,370 --> 05:09:51,490
No sign of the AWOL man.

5015
05:09:52,450 --> 05:09:53,650
No, no, please.

5016
05:09:54,610 --> 05:09:55,610
No, God, no!

5017
05:10:04,810 --> 05:10:05,810
I shot.

5018
05:10:06,190 --> 05:10:07,410
I shot your radio.

5019
05:10:07,810 --> 05:10:08,690
I shot your radio.

5020
05:10:09,310 --> 05:10:10,390
Wait, where's my...

5021
05:10:10,450 --> 05:10:10,910
body armor.

5022
05:10:11,070 --> 05:10:11,450
Oh, there it is.

5023
05:10:11,650 --> 05:10:13,450
I always pass it like a bajillion times.

5024
05:10:14,050 --> 05:10:16,010
I can't believe I got scammed, for real.

5025
05:10:18,810 --> 05:10:19,430
Oh, thanks.

5026
05:10:25,080 --> 05:10:26,840
How am I supposed to get out of this, though?

5027
05:10:28,680 --> 05:10:29,300
How am I supposed?

5028
05:10:29,360 --> 05:10:30,440
They're just gonna all keep coming.

5029
05:10:30,560 --> 05:10:32,260
They're all just gonna keep running up here and over here.

5030
05:10:34,180 --> 05:10:34,200
Hmm.

5031
05:10:35,800 --> 05:10:36,120
Doshio.

5032
05:10:37,360 --> 05:10:37,540
Gotta

5033
05:10:40,830 --> 05:10:41,590
run out of rations.

5034
05:10:42,550 --> 05:10:46,790
I feel like I should just Oh, oh.

5035
05:11:02,160 --> 05:11:05,040
Just gonna have to blast on my way, oh, oh.

5036
05:11:05,600 --> 05:11:06,880
Blast my way through them, I think.

5037
05:11:14,840 --> 05:11:16,540
Snake, I didn't.

5038
05:11:16,820 --> 05:11:17,860
You got past security.

5039
05:11:18,340 --> 05:11:21,460
My grip is not good enough, I think, for hanging over the
railing.

5040
05:11:22,640 --> 05:11:24,520
I think my grip is too small.

5041
05:11:24,520 --> 05:11:27,120
So what about the PAL override system that Baker talked
about?

5042
05:11:27,600 --> 05:11:28,560
Haven't found it yet.

5043
05:11:28,900 --> 05:11:29,380
That's okay.

5044
05:11:29,460 --> 05:11:30,380
That's what I need to know.

5045
05:11:30,820 --> 05:11:33,120
But Snake, I found something else.

5046
05:11:33,440 --> 05:11:33,700
What?

5047
05:11:34,160 --> 05:11:36,500
The secret behind the new nuclear weapon.

5048
05:11:36,700 --> 05:11:37,480
Huh, what's that?

5049
05:11:37,480 --> 05:11:38,140
Just as I thought.

5050
05:11:38,620 --> 05:11:42,620
The nuclear warhead is designed to be fired from the railgun
like a projectile.

5051
05:11:43,320 --> 05:11:46,400
It doesn't use fuel, so it isn't considered a missile.

5052
05:11:46,820 --> 05:11:49,600
That way it can get around all sorts of international
treaties.

5053
05:11:49,640 --> 05:11:50,100
Oh my god.

5054
05:11:50,220 --> 05:11:50,920
Pretty sneaky.

5055
05:11:51,300 --> 05:11:51,860
Sneaky.

5056
05:11:52,320 --> 05:11:53,060
But effective.

5057
05:11:53,640 --> 05:11:56,140
And that's not even the scariest thing about this weapon.

5058
05:11:56,520 --> 05:11:58,300
I can't wait to hear this.

5059
05:11:58,940 --> 05:12:00,580
It's a stealth weapon.

5060
05:12:00,760 --> 05:12:02,220
Oh, so scary.

5061
05:12:02,300 --> 05:12:03,640
It won't show up on radar.

5062
05:12:04,160 --> 05:12:04,640
Yeah.

5063
05:12:05,520 --> 05:12:09,920
The truth is, they've been working on a stealth missile
since the late 70s.

5064
05:12:10,540 --> 05:12:12,760
Why weren't they able to develop one up until now?

5065
05:12:13,440 --> 05:12:15,640
Because of the missile's rocket propulsion system.

5066
05:12:16,140 --> 05:12:18,140
It would be picked up by enemy satellites.

5067
05:12:18,800 --> 05:12:19,240
Because of that?

5068
05:12:19,920 --> 05:12:26,180
But unlike a missile, the railgun doesn't burn any
propellant, so it can't be detected by any current ballistic

5069
05:12:26,180 --> 05:12:27,460
missile detection system.

5070
05:12:27,900 --> 05:12:28,000
Insanity.

5071
05:12:28,100 --> 05:12:29,820
An invisible nuclear warhead.

5072
05:12:30,060 --> 05:12:30,740
So scary.

5073
05:12:30,860 --> 05:12:32,640
Totally impossible to intercept.

5074
05:12:32,700 --> 05:12:33,520
Oh my god.

5075
05:12:34,160 --> 05:12:41,120
of that it's got a surface piercing warhead designed to
penetrate hardened underground bases we learned how made the

5076
05:12:41,120 --> 05:12:48,520
thing yeah did you not think could mean the end of the world
it's the ultimate weapon and from a political point of view

5077
05:12:48,520 --> 05:12:56,000
didn't you make this the problem of nuclear reduction and
nuclear inspections Colonel is this true are you listening

5078
05:12:56,000 --> 05:13:04,080
I'm listening it would push back the signing of the start 3
treaty if word gets out about this weapon it cause a whole

5079
05:13:04,080 --> 05:13:11,780
world of trouble oh yeah yeah it would be nasty the united
states would be denounced by the un it could even bring the

5080
05:13:11,780 --> 05:13:19,140
president down oh my god did you know this colonel not the
president i'm sorry you've changed colonel god i'm so

5081
05:13:19,140 --> 05:13:27,900
disappointed i'm disappointed in your colonel listen to me
this new nuclear weapon it's never actually been tested only

5082
05:13:27,900 --> 05:13:34,400
simulated you mean with vr experiments yeah that's why they
were conducting this Man, they love VR.

5083
05:13:34,620 --> 05:13:38,000
They needed to get actual experimental data to back up the
simulation.

5084
05:13:38,440 --> 05:13:39,000
VR is the future.

5085
05:13:39,220 --> 05:13:40,660
What were the results of the exercise?

5086
05:13:41,260 --> 05:13:43,160
It looks like it went better than they hoped for.

5087
05:13:43,660 --> 05:13:47,080
But I can't find the data anywhere on this network.

5088
05:13:47,660 --> 05:13:50,680
You'd think the data as important as that would be carefully
recorded.

5089
05:13:50,740 --> 05:13:51,500
How built the mech?

5090
05:13:51,780 --> 05:13:52,700
Didn't build the railgun?

5091
05:13:52,820 --> 05:13:53,700
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

5092
05:13:53,700 --> 05:13:54,180
Oh, okay.

5093
05:13:54,180 --> 05:13:54,880
Oh, okay.

5094
05:13:55,840 --> 05:13:56,160
What?

5095
05:13:56,840 --> 05:13:57,700
Do you still have it?

5096
05:13:57,920 --> 05:13:58,260
No.

5097
05:13:58,860 --> 05:14:00,220
Ocelot took it from me.

5098
05:14:00,720 --> 05:14:01,000
Damn.

5099
05:14:01,380 --> 05:14:01,740
Damn.

5100
05:14:01,740 --> 05:14:05,420
The terrorists have replaced the dummy warhead with a real
warhead.

5101
05:14:05,520 --> 05:14:06,020
Oh my god.

5102
05:14:06,280 --> 05:14:09,580
Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready
to launch.

5103
05:14:09,960 --> 05:14:11,700
So, you think they can do it?

5104
05:14:12,180 --> 05:14:18,120
Well, the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the
real thing, so I think so.

5105
05:14:18,580 --> 05:14:20,660
Did you find out how to override it yet?

5106
05:14:21,240 --> 05:14:21,760
Not yet.

5107
05:14:22,100 --> 05:14:23,660
It must be in a separate file.

5108
05:14:24,280 --> 05:14:27,180
Right now, I'm looking through all of Baker's personal
files.

5109
05:14:27,740 --> 05:14:28,980
We're counting on you.

5110
05:14:29,180 --> 05:14:29,960
We're counting.

5111
05:14:30,060 --> 05:14:30,500
Oh, shoot.

5112
05:14:30,720 --> 05:14:31,200
Uh, shoot.

5113
05:14:31,360 --> 05:14:31,640
For real.

5114
05:14:34,300 --> 05:14:35,140
Oh, hello?

5115
05:14:35,380 --> 05:14:36,040
Oh, it's empty!

5116
05:14:36,780 --> 05:14:37,320
Oh, no.

5117
05:14:43,640 --> 05:14:44,160
Anyway.

5118
05:14:48,960 --> 05:14:49,480
Anyway.

5119
05:14:56,350 --> 05:14:56,870
Snake.

5120
05:14:57,590 --> 05:14:57,770
Yeah.

5121
05:14:58,590 --> 05:14:59,090
That was fast.

5122
05:14:59,310 --> 05:15:04,190
I haven't found out about the override system yet, but I
found Baker's ulterior motive.

5123
05:15:04,530 --> 05:15:06,290
He's just looking to get rich, isn't he?

5124
05:15:06,730 --> 05:15:07,630
That's part of it.

5125
05:15:08,070 --> 05:15:10,990
Arms tech is in much worse financial trouble than I thought.

5126
05:15:11,490 --> 05:15:13,890
I know they lost their bid to make the next generation.

5127
05:15:13,910 --> 05:15:21,350
fighter jet that plus the reduction in SDI spending it looks
like there was even some talk of a hostile takeover oh

5128
05:15:21,350 --> 05:15:27,690
everything was riding on this project I guess and it looks
like they were paying a lot of bribe money to the DARPA

5129
05:15:27,690 --> 05:15:37,090
chief that guy yeah it's the worst was a big proponent of
the nuclear deterrent chief is the worst so anyway what

5130
05:15:37,090 --> 05:15:39,990
about the override just give me a little bit longer

5131
05:15:47,010 --> 05:15:48,050
Are there people?

5132
05:15:48,330 --> 05:15:48,610
Oh, shoot.

5133
05:15:48,970 --> 05:15:48,970
Okay.

5134
05:15:49,190 --> 05:15:50,170
Ah, time to go!

5135
05:15:50,530 --> 05:15:50,890
Cutscene!

5136
05:15:52,630 --> 05:15:53,830
Cutscene time!

5137
05:16:01,980 --> 05:16:03,640
Oh, oh, oh!

5138
05:16:04,940 --> 05:16:05,540
Yes!

5139
05:16:05,760 --> 05:16:06,280
Go, Snake.

5140
05:16:06,580 --> 05:16:09,640
I've entered the PAL codes and disengaged the safety device.

5141
05:16:10,900 --> 05:16:12,360
We can launch anytime.

5142
05:16:13,760 --> 05:16:15,880
There's still no response from Washington.

5143
05:16:16,620 --> 05:16:20,040
It looks like we'll have to show them that we mean business.

5144
05:16:20,220 --> 05:16:20,660
Yeah.

5145
05:16:21,560 --> 05:16:22,260
Oh.

5146
05:16:23,220 --> 05:16:23,780
Dummy.

5147
05:16:24,100 --> 05:16:26,000
Should I set it for Cherniton Russia?

5148
05:16:27,160 --> 05:16:27,380
No.

5149
05:16:28,320 --> 05:16:29,920
There's been a change.

5150
05:16:30,460 --> 05:16:33,340
The new target is Lopnor China.

5151
05:16:35,340 --> 05:16:35,920
Why, boss?

5152
05:16:36,240 --> 05:16:37,500
Why, boss?

5153
05:16:38,640 --> 05:16:41,340
Oh, he's so beautiful.

5154
05:16:42,520 --> 05:16:42,520
Liquid.

5155
05:16:42,860 --> 05:16:43,240
Liquid.

5156
05:16:43,720 --> 05:16:49,620
I'm sure neither you nor Mr. Golukovic would really like to
see a nuclear bomb dropped on your motherland, right?

5157
05:16:50,220 --> 05:16:51,060
But why?

5158
05:16:51,480 --> 05:16:52,580
There's nothing there.

5159
05:16:53,560 --> 05:16:53,580
Wrong.

5160
05:16:54,440 --> 05:16:56,320
It's a nuclear test site.

5161
05:16:57,800 --> 05:16:59,300
A nuclear test site.

5162
05:17:00,180 --> 05:17:04,160
If we nuke a major population center, the game's over.

5163
05:17:05,520 --> 05:17:11,280
But a nuclear explosion at a test site can still be
concealed from the public.

5164
05:17:12,380 --> 05:17:16,420
Meanwhile, Washington will be worried about the retaliatory
strike from China.

5165
05:17:17,240 --> 05:17:20,200
That'll probably mean top-secret talks between both.

5166
05:17:20,220 --> 05:17:29,380
countries leaders top secret of course and in the process
the president will be forced to divulge the existence of a

5167
05:17:29,380 --> 05:17:38,200
new and highly destabilizing nuclear weapon to the Chinese
what do you think that will do to the US's reputation or the

5168
05:17:38,200 --> 05:17:49,840
president oh my god and with the CTBT that means that China
in India I think you missed a letter there wait I saw what

5169
05:17:49,840 --> 05:17:56,180
this Yes, when the other countries hear about the new
weapon, they'll all want to contact us.

5170
05:17:57,220 --> 05:18:01,960
Washington won't be very happy when we start selling their
own system to the highest bidders.

5171
05:18:05,060 --> 05:18:07,560
Yes, the president will break.

5172
05:18:08,180 --> 05:18:10,260
He will give in to our demands.

5173
05:18:11,560 --> 05:18:14,800
Big Boss's DNA and one billion dollars.

5174
05:18:15,100 --> 05:18:17,200
One billion dollars.

5175
05:18:17,680 --> 05:18:18,400
All for money?

5176
05:18:18,940 --> 05:18:19,260
No.

5177
05:18:20,220 --> 05:18:26,420
will be used to cure our genome soldiers as well does it
care about the money i'm also including the fox die vaccine

5178
05:18:26,420 --> 05:18:35,500
in our demands fox die it killed octopus in the arms tech
president so it's true that it affects older people first

5179
05:18:35,500 --> 05:18:44,500
mantis might not have been affected because he wore a mask
wolf wasn't infected either perhaps due to those

5180
05:18:44,500 --> 05:18:46,660
tranquilizers she always took

5181
05:18:50,220 --> 05:18:57,480
Adrenaline levels in the blood they deployed a product still
in development into live combat no surprise it was

5182
05:18:57,480 --> 05:19:06,680
unreliable Ridiculous they must have been desperate
Desperate in any case have you heard from your friend

5183
05:19:06,680 --> 05:19:15,960
Colonel Sergei Golukovic at Spetsnaz yet He still has doubts
about the ability of Metal Gear by the way this person's

5184
05:19:15,960 --> 05:19:22,560
full name and where they're at You know, I gotta give you
some context.

5185
05:19:24,400 --> 05:19:26,240
There's nothing to worry about.

5186
05:19:26,860 --> 05:19:29,940
The Colonel wants Metal Gear and the new nuclear weapon so
bad he can taste it.

5187
05:19:29,940 --> 05:19:31,440
Oh, the Pazazabine saved me from Foxdie?

5188
05:19:31,600 --> 05:19:32,100
Oh, maybe.

5189
05:19:32,180 --> 05:19:35,220
Russia wants to regain its position as a military
superpower.

5190
05:19:35,900 --> 05:19:38,380
They need to reinforce their nuclear arsenal.

5191
05:19:39,180 --> 05:19:42,040
They need a nuclear weapon that can't be intercepted.

5192
05:19:42,820 --> 05:19:47,740
Metal Gear will allow them to gain first strike capability
over the rest of the world.

5193
05:19:48,440 --> 05:19:49,440
Oh, my God.

5194
05:19:50,220 --> 05:20:00,660
is in shambles in shambles restore their country's military
power with nuclear weapons that galukovic he's no warrior

5195
05:20:00,660 --> 05:20:11,120
he's he's a politician maybe so he's the one who gave us the
hind and most of our other heavy firepower he's got over a

5196
05:20:11,120 --> 05:20:17,500
thousand soldiers under his command what just happened if we
joined forces did i just accidentally zoom in quite a

5197
05:20:17,500 --> 05:20:23,340
resistance here sorry I almost dropped my controller since
Mantis died the genome soldiers brainwashing has started to

5198
05:20:23,340 --> 05:20:32,640
wear off you zoom in I'm worried about the men's morale an
alliance with the Russians would boost that as well hmm what

5199
05:20:32,640 --> 05:20:44,540
are you saying oh my god we are not going anywhere we're
going to dig in here what it's going to be a long war we

5200
05:20:44,540 --> 05:20:51,640
could still escape we We have the new nuclear power, and
we're going to ally with Belukovic's forces.

5201
05:20:52,540 --> 05:20:54,520
Are you going to fight the whole world?

5202
05:20:55,760 --> 05:20:57,240
What's wrong with that?

5203
05:20:57,480 --> 05:20:58,600
Fighting the whole world?

5204
05:20:59,320 --> 05:21:00,580
But I can't move around.

5205
05:21:00,840 --> 05:21:05,480
From here, we can launch a nuclear warhead at any target on
this planet.

5206
05:21:06,020 --> 05:21:11,100
A nuclear warhead invisible to radar and totally immune to
interception.

5207
05:21:11,280 --> 05:21:11,900
I can't move it, though.

5208
05:21:11,920 --> 05:21:15,840
And on top of that, this base is full of spare nuclear
warheads.

5209
05:21:16,400 --> 05:21:17,740
The other one.

5210
05:21:18,020 --> 05:21:23,500
Once we get the DNA and the money, the world will be ours.

5211
05:21:24,360 --> 05:21:28,060
But boss, what about your promise to Colonel Kulukovic?

5212
05:21:30,980 --> 05:21:34,400
I have no interest in the revival of Mother Russia.

5213
05:21:35,580 --> 05:21:38,420
You're not thinking of reviving Big Boss's dream.

5214
05:21:38,960 --> 05:21:39,960
Oh, oh, oh.

5215
05:21:40,220 --> 05:21:43,560
From today, you can call this place...

5216
05:21:43,560 --> 05:21:44,620
Don't say it.

5217
05:21:45,120 --> 05:21:45,800
No!

5218
05:21:46,400 --> 05:21:46,780
Ow!

5219
05:21:46,940 --> 05:21:47,980
Big boss's dream.

5220
05:21:49,700 --> 05:21:50,220
Outer?

5221
05:21:50,660 --> 05:21:50,920
Heavy?

5222
05:21:51,000 --> 05:21:54,080
Boss, you're not worried about the pal being overridden?

5223
05:21:54,840 --> 05:21:57,700
If the code is entered again, it will be deactivated.

5224
05:21:58,680 --> 05:22:00,960
Oh, that was the most convincing delivery ever.

5225
05:22:01,260 --> 05:22:03,840
The DARPA chief and the arms tech president are both dead.

5226
05:22:04,700 --> 05:22:07,320
Does Snake know how the override system works?

5227
05:22:07,800 --> 05:22:10,840
Boss, he doesn't know how to over- oh my god, his neck?

5228
05:22:11,640 --> 05:22:13,460
He didn't have any keys on him.

5229
05:22:14,040 --> 05:22:14,520
Good.

5230
05:22:14,960 --> 05:22:16,380
Then no one can stop him.

5231
05:22:16,400 --> 05:22:21,740
Oh my god.

5232
05:22:22,660 --> 05:22:26,920
Boss, he doesn't know how to put in the detonate or the...

5233
05:22:26,920 --> 05:22:27,980
What should we do with that woman?

5234
05:22:28,680 --> 05:22:30,400
Want me to kill her?

5235
05:22:30,540 --> 05:22:31,420
Want me to kill her.

5236
05:22:31,420 --> 05:22:32,200
Let her live.

5237
05:22:32,640 --> 05:22:35,460
She's Campbell's niece and Snake cares for her.

5238
05:22:36,180 --> 05:22:39,380
We'll keep her as our ace in the hole.

5239
05:22:40,100 --> 05:22:41,960
Merrill, she's alive.

5240
05:22:42,220 --> 05:22:42,560
Merrill.

5241
05:22:47,680 --> 05:22:56,780
emoji snake I found Baker's top secret files great job how's
it going there they finished inputting the PAL codes oh my

5242
05:22:56,780 --> 05:23:05,380
god so how do we deactivate them okay you see the override
system how to deactivate can also be used to input the

5243
05:23:05,380 --> 05:23:13,700
detonation codes you see if you insert the keys when a
warhead is active you deactivate it and if you insert them

5244
05:23:13,700 --> 05:23:21,980
when it's inactive it becomes activated and you can only use
the keys once only once huh you need the keys for input

5245
05:23:21,980 --> 05:23:30,600
three of them but i only have the one where are the others
hold on a minute you see that's the trick you already have

5246
05:23:30,600 --> 05:23:40,660
all three keys what are you talking about the card key is
made of a shape memory alloy oh shape memory alloy it's a

5247
05:23:40,660 --> 05:23:49,320
material that changes shape at different temperatures the
key is made out of it this card key yeah the card key

5248
05:23:49,320 --> 05:24:00,160
changes shape at different temperatures oh this key is
actually three keys in one clever so clever so so clever can

5249
05:24:00,160 --> 05:24:08,780
you see the input terminals in the center of the control
room I do they're very obviously laid out yes I don't think

5250
05:24:08,780 --> 05:24:15,160
I need a okay those three laptop terminals are for the
emergency if you're gonna wait out your binoculars at least

5251
05:24:15,160 --> 05:24:25,740
zoom in okay thank you there should be a symbol on each
screen mm-hmm each symbol corresponds to a different key you

5252
05:24:25,740 --> 05:24:34,600
input the keys in order from left to right the left ones for
the room temperature key see the symbol yes next to that

5253
05:24:34,600 --> 05:24:43,460
goes the low temperature key the one on the right is the
high temperature okay okay I got it I got first I changed

5254
05:24:43,480 --> 05:24:46,780
the shape of the card, and then I input them in order,
right?

5255
05:24:47,440 --> 05:24:48,000
That's right.

5256
05:24:48,460 --> 05:24:50,840
All you do is insert the card keys.

5257
05:24:51,640 --> 05:24:57,060
After you insert the key into the module, a hard disk reads
the information contained on it.

5258
05:24:57,140 --> 05:24:57,840
They're not even talking.

5259
05:24:58,240 --> 05:25:01,680
Once you've finished with all three terminals, the code
input process is complete.

5260
05:25:02,860 --> 05:25:03,720
But here's the thing.

5261
05:25:04,120 --> 05:25:06,580
You can only use the key three times.

5262
05:25:07,060 --> 05:25:10,080
It's an emergency system, and it's only meant to be used
once.

5263
05:25:11,020 --> 05:25:19,980
In awkward gatherings, I employ solid snake I just say what
they said but ask it in a question.

5264
05:25:23,400 --> 05:25:24,280
Who's that?

5265
05:25:28,580 --> 05:25:29,560
Oh my god!

5266
05:25:30,220 --> 05:25:30,520
Snake!

5267
05:25:30,780 --> 05:25:32,860
Oh, oh, oh, he's looking at the bullet.

5268
05:25:35,900 --> 05:25:38,280
Oh no, I forgot about this part.

5269
05:25:38,880 --> 05:25:40,240
Oh, our card key!

5270
05:25:43,480 --> 05:25:44,940
Oh, so clumsy.

5271
05:25:45,320 --> 05:25:47,360
The key fell in the drainage ditch.

5272
05:25:47,600 --> 05:25:49,500
The key here fell in the drainage ditch.

5273
05:25:50,040 --> 05:25:50,180
Ouch!

5274
05:25:51,420 --> 05:25:53,660
This is bulletproof glass.

5275
05:25:53,820 --> 05:25:55,620
There's no way in.

5276
05:25:56,120 --> 05:25:58,020
I'll enjoy watching you die.

5277
05:25:58,020 --> 05:26:00,240
This is bulletproof glass.

5278
05:26:01,380 --> 05:26:04,400
Snick, you've got to get that key.

5279
05:26:06,260 --> 05:26:07,100
Snick!

5280
05:26:07,620 --> 05:26:09,940
This is bulletproof glass.

5281
05:26:11,860 --> 05:26:13,460
Okay, I'll go get that.

5282
05:26:13,480 --> 05:26:14,160
Look at it.

5283
05:26:17,980 --> 05:26:21,640
So, the people I'm seeing walking is them, right?

5284
05:26:22,860 --> 05:26:23,540
Like...

5285
05:26:23,540 --> 05:26:23,980
Oh.

5286
05:26:25,320 --> 05:26:26,000
Wait.

5287
05:26:30,460 --> 05:26:32,160
Yeah, it's them inside.

5288
05:26:32,340 --> 05:26:32,900
That's so funny.

5289
05:26:38,420 --> 05:26:39,100
Okay.

5290
05:26:39,860 --> 05:26:40,460
Alright.

5291
05:26:40,820 --> 05:26:42,040
Let's go get us...

5292
05:26:42,880 --> 05:26:44,520
Let's go get us a card key.

5293
05:26:50,700 --> 05:26:52,460
Could use some more bullets.

5294
05:26:52,580 --> 05:26:53,980
Especially since I ran out.

5295
05:26:54,680 --> 05:26:55,700
Where are my famus?

5296
05:26:55,820 --> 05:26:56,180
25?

5297
05:26:56,740 --> 05:26:56,960
Oh.

5298
05:26:57,340 --> 05:26:58,060
Oh my god.

5299
05:26:58,380 --> 05:26:58,760
No way.

5300
05:26:59,640 --> 05:27:00,680
Where were you?

5301
05:27:01,580 --> 05:27:01,940
Where?

5302
05:27:02,460 --> 05:27:03,100
Where were you?

5303
05:27:03,520 --> 05:27:05,080
Where were you the whole time?

5304
05:27:05,600 --> 05:27:06,180
Where were you?

5305
05:27:08,140 --> 05:27:09,000
Wait, actually?

5306
05:27:09,560 --> 05:27:09,920
Let's see.

5307
05:27:10,260 --> 05:27:11,500
Maybe we can...

5308
05:27:11,500 --> 05:27:12,220
Oh, but if I...

5309
05:27:12,840 --> 05:27:13,360
Oh.

5310
05:27:15,920 --> 05:27:16,880
I don't know.

5311
05:27:17,000 --> 05:27:17,980
If I put him down.

5312
05:27:18,800 --> 05:27:20,140
If I make him sleepy.

5313
05:27:21,980 --> 05:27:22,560
Or a...

5314
05:27:22,580 --> 05:27:23,440
your status report.

5315
05:27:23,820 --> 05:27:24,220
It's fine.

5316
05:27:28,940 --> 05:27:29,400
Maybe it's fine.

5317
05:27:32,380 --> 05:27:32,800
Maybe it's fine.

5318
05:27:34,320 --> 05:27:35,200
Excuse me.

5319
05:27:35,960 --> 05:27:37,880
Are there any other guys?

5320
05:27:38,620 --> 05:27:39,980
They're not showing up if there are.

5321
05:27:40,400 --> 05:27:41,540
Wait, can I go down here?

5322
05:27:41,780 --> 05:27:42,620
What's down here?

5323
05:27:46,060 --> 05:27:47,180
There's a lot of...

5324
05:27:47,180 --> 05:27:47,340
Wait.

5325
05:27:47,760 --> 05:27:48,700
I don't...

5326
05:27:48,700 --> 05:27:50,560
This is not used to be here, right?

5327
05:27:53,120 --> 05:27:53,560
Right?

5328
05:27:54,240 --> 05:27:55,640
This is new, right?

5329
05:28:03,750 --> 05:28:07,470
I feel like I hear someone else walking around.

5330
05:28:08,770 --> 05:28:09,610
I don't think it's me.

5331
05:28:10,570 --> 05:28:14,890
But I don't see anyone else on the radar, so I was just...

5332
05:28:14,890 --> 05:28:16,370
This is completely different.

5333
05:28:26,140 --> 05:28:27,420
Sorry, I'm going to shoot your butt.

5334
05:28:31,210 --> 05:28:31,390
Okay.

5335
05:28:32,550 --> 05:28:32,870
Alright.

5336
05:28:33,570 --> 05:28:34,730
Wait, I came this way.

5337
05:28:35,050 --> 05:28:35,310
Okay.

5338
05:28:36,830 --> 05:28:38,650
Now at least I know where they're at.

5339
05:28:38,670 --> 05:28:44,430
Before, I think what the trouble was, was I was like seeing
them on the radar, but there's so many tiny little stairs

5340
05:28:44,430 --> 05:28:49,110
areas in here that I'm like, I didn't know where they were
walking at, you know.

5341
05:28:49,650 --> 05:28:53,690
But now we at least know where... Wait, how do I... How do I
get down?

5342
05:28:54,830 --> 05:28:55,570
I'm lost.

5343
05:28:56,470 --> 05:28:57,030
Wait, I'm lost.

5344
05:28:58,250 --> 05:29:00,050
Wait, oh, uh, here, here, here.

5345
05:29:00,710 --> 05:29:01,350
Let's grab this.

5346
05:29:01,770 --> 05:29:02,330
Nope, just kidding.

5347
05:29:03,130 --> 05:29:03,350
Okay.

5348
05:29:09,460 --> 05:29:10,620
I'm hearing something.

5349
05:29:12,840 --> 05:29:13,240
Okay.

5350
05:29:13,900 --> 05:29:15,060
What the heck am I hearing?

5351
05:29:17,120 --> 05:29:19,960
Look at them, they're in there talking with each other.

5352
05:29:23,930 --> 05:29:25,270
Okay, nice, nice, nice, nice.

5353
05:29:26,550 --> 05:29:29,270
If I put on the body armor, does it help?

5354
05:29:31,990 --> 05:29:32,390
La la!

5355
05:29:33,450 --> 05:29:34,750
How do I find this thing?

5356
05:29:35,910 --> 05:29:36,870
We got more bullets?

5357
05:29:39,630 --> 05:29:40,370
Wait, got it!

5358
05:29:40,490 --> 05:29:41,090
A time bomb!

5359
05:29:42,310 --> 05:29:43,090
Wait a second.

5360
05:29:46,410 --> 05:29:47,550
Where is that?

5361
05:29:48,230 --> 05:29:49,210
Where's the time bomb?

5362
05:29:54,900 --> 05:29:54,980
Oh.

5363
05:29:58,260 --> 05:29:58,580
Wow.

5364
05:30:04,520 --> 05:30:06,080
Uh, uh, please, Snake.

5365
05:30:08,200 --> 05:30:08,560
Hmm.

5366
05:30:11,040 --> 05:30:12,400
Maybe it's down here.

5367
05:30:12,920 --> 05:30:13,340
Oh, Ration?

5368
05:30:13,580 --> 05:30:13,780
Nice.

5369
05:30:14,360 --> 05:30:15,020
Take it.

5370
05:30:18,950 --> 05:30:20,410
Rex's bath water.

5371
05:30:21,630 --> 05:30:24,910
If you drink this, you will literally get super power.

5372
05:30:25,850 --> 05:30:29,660
I hope these guys aren't awake.

5373
05:30:31,000 --> 05:30:31,340
Okay.

5374
05:30:32,760 --> 05:30:33,480
Palky!

5375
05:30:39,240 --> 05:30:39,960
Okay.

5376
05:30:42,760 --> 05:30:44,040
There we go.

5377
05:30:45,260 --> 05:30:46,320
Very nice.

5378
05:30:47,180 --> 05:30:48,740
Gotta go all the way back.

5379
05:30:49,820 --> 05:30:55,480
You will become the world's most powerful soldier if you
drink this water.

5380
05:31:02,180 --> 05:31:04,200
Any VTuber fan would be honored.

5381
05:31:07,990 --> 05:31:09,710
Hopefully these guys are still...

5382
05:31:11,290 --> 05:31:12,570
Just take you there.

5383
05:31:12,950 --> 05:31:13,130
Yeah.

5384
05:31:13,710 --> 05:31:14,930
Give you a little extra.

5385
05:31:16,890 --> 05:31:17,670
And this guy too.

5386
05:31:18,710 --> 05:31:19,010
Yeah.

5387
05:31:19,390 --> 05:31:20,450
Oh, you only got two.

5388
05:31:21,110 --> 05:31:21,630
There you go.

5389
05:31:21,730 --> 05:31:22,610
Now you got three.

5390
05:31:29,470 --> 05:31:29,990
Okay.

5391
05:31:31,230 --> 05:31:31,910
back here, right?

5392
05:31:31,990 --> 05:31:32,490
Yeah, right?

5393
05:31:34,590 --> 05:31:36,190
Then I go inside.

5394
05:31:38,350 --> 05:31:38,950
Oh, they're gone.

5395
05:31:41,990 --> 05:31:43,390
Where could they have gone?

5396
05:31:51,740 --> 05:31:52,780
Very good.

5397
05:31:54,540 --> 05:31:54,640
Hmm.

5398
05:31:56,240 --> 05:31:56,820
Nice.

5399
05:31:58,800 --> 05:32:01,100
Do I just, uh...

5400
05:32:01,100 --> 05:32:12,760
Okay, so this one, first our little pal key insert call
otakai now that you found the key okay oh yeah i should be

5401
05:32:12,760 --> 05:32:24,180
calling people snake re-input the pal codes colonel i'm
scared what if it doesn't work what if you're what if you're

5402
05:32:24,180 --> 05:32:33,140
tricking me you've got the card key back good job now hurry
to the control room yes of course master he's the only one i

5403
05:32:33,140 --> 05:32:37,440
can trust so it's fine You found the card key, right?

5404
05:32:38,080 --> 05:32:39,860
First comes the room temperature key.

5405
05:32:40,280 --> 05:32:42,760
Put it into the far left terminal in the control room.

5406
05:32:43,460 --> 05:32:45,880
That key is actually an IC card.

5407
05:32:46,600 --> 05:32:50,340
Its connector pins and main body are made of a shape memory
alloy.

5408
05:32:50,420 --> 05:32:50,760
Ooh.

5409
05:32:50,960 --> 05:32:56,840
It's designed so that unless it's been changed to the
correct shape, it won't be recognized by the PAL code input

5410
05:32:56,840 --> 05:33:00,380
terminal in the control room, and the detonation code won't
be entered.

5411
05:33:01,960 --> 05:33:02,480
So...

5412
05:33:04,760 --> 05:33:06,720
I could just...

5413
05:33:06,720 --> 05:33:07,440
What if I...

5414
05:33:07,440 --> 05:33:08,940
What if I mess it up a little?

5415
05:33:09,640 --> 05:33:11,080
What if I just...

5416
05:33:11,080 --> 05:33:11,560
Oh, wait.

5417
05:33:12,580 --> 05:33:13,620
It's not activated.

5418
05:33:13,900 --> 05:33:14,580
Oh, I mean, sorry.

5419
05:33:14,920 --> 05:33:16,080
We're deactivating it.

5420
05:33:16,560 --> 05:33:18,020
But I think I mentioned this earlier.

5421
05:33:18,160 --> 05:33:22,040
But there's actually an easier way to do some of these.

5422
05:33:22,620 --> 05:33:23,880
Like, uh...

5423
05:33:23,880 --> 05:33:24,780
I think...

5424
05:33:24,780 --> 05:33:25,840
I think it's...

5425
05:33:25,840 --> 05:33:28,260
Well, you like have to shoot a pipe.

5426
05:33:28,660 --> 05:33:31,820
And it will allow you to do the hot and the cold.

5427
05:33:31,920 --> 05:33:33,300
Not having to go all the way back.

5428
05:33:33,780 --> 05:33:34,220
So...

5429
05:33:35,780 --> 05:33:36,660
We'll see.

5430
05:33:40,240 --> 05:33:40,500
Beep beep.

5431
05:33:42,160 --> 05:33:43,780
Yeah, there's a Lend with a hot and a cold pipe.

5432
05:33:44,000 --> 05:33:44,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5433
05:33:45,480 --> 05:33:46,340
So I don't know.

5434
05:33:46,400 --> 05:33:49,800
I might do the quick way because I think it's kind of cool
that it's unique to this game.

5435
05:34:00,290 --> 05:34:00,730
Alright.

5436
05:34:00,970 --> 05:34:03,710
Rex, you're not getting activated today.

5437
05:34:05,670 --> 05:34:07,230
Oh, gas attacked.

5438
05:34:07,810 --> 05:34:10,290
Pal code number one confirmed.

5439
05:34:13,850 --> 05:34:14,530
Nice.

5440
05:34:16,710 --> 05:34:18,430
That takes care of pal code number one.

5441
05:34:20,150 --> 05:34:21,590
Now, pal number two.

5442
05:34:22,490 --> 05:34:22,970
Freeze the key.

5443
05:34:23,310 --> 05:34:24,210
Freeze the key.

5444
05:34:24,970 --> 05:34:25,890
Oh, wait.

5445
05:34:27,870 --> 05:34:30,310
Do I get gas attacked when I complete them?

5446
05:34:32,770 --> 05:34:33,030
Oh.

5447
05:34:38,480 --> 05:34:39,680
Oh, I forget.

5448
05:34:41,560 --> 05:34:43,660
Oh, he's still down.

5449
05:34:44,220 --> 05:34:44,620
Let's go.

5450
05:34:45,280 --> 05:34:45,900
Now I...

5451
05:34:45,900 --> 05:34:46,120
Okay.

5452
05:34:47,080 --> 05:34:50,100
The issue is, I don't actually know where these pipes are.

5453
05:34:51,280 --> 05:34:53,300
I think...

5454
05:34:55,140 --> 05:34:56,400
Look at him.

5455
05:34:57,420 --> 05:34:58,520
Slumbering baby.

5456
05:35:00,220 --> 05:35:03,080

Alrighty.

5492
05:37:08,060 --> 05:37:08,540

My bad.

5503
05:37:19,940 --> 05:37:20,380
We're fine.

5504
05:37:20,580 --> 05:37:21,040
Come on, Snake.

5505
05:37:21,220 --> 05:37:21,600
Shake it off.

5506
05:37:25,480 --> 05:37:32,380
it's actually okay that's so cool oh my gosh how nice i'm
just gonna keep shooting these guys every time i go past

5507
05:37:32,380 --> 05:37:41,980
them no use in having them wake up i mean honestly i could
just kill them then they then they'd never be a bother then

5508
05:37:41,980 --> 05:37:44,700
they would never wake up

5509
05:37:49,280 --> 05:37:58,940
yeah is that just for twin snakes yes it is just for twin
snakes so you will not find that because you can't hang in

5510
05:38:00,440 --> 05:38:06,900
in regular Metal Gear Solid number two

5511
05:38:18,000 --> 05:38:26,260
you've killed so many why I hold back on these two that's
true they did give me a really hard time they did I am still

5512
05:38:26,260 --> 05:38:32,120
annoyed at the fact that they I'm still annoyed at the fact
that they gave me a hard time because i didn't know where

5513
05:38:32,120 --> 05:38:42,240
they were yeah pal code number two confirmed y'all waiting
pal code number three mint this saves me like 15 minutes i

5514
05:38:42,240 --> 05:38:48,940
know there goes pal code number two it's kind of awesome
next comes pal number three warm the key which is so funny

5515
05:38:48,940 --> 05:38:57,980
because like i was so maybe maybe i feel like i'm more okay
with doing this because i was so adamant about the um about

5516
05:38:57,980 --> 05:39:06,140
the sniper about the psg that like it and it took so long
for me to get it that i'm like you know what we can save a

5517
05:39:06,140 --> 05:39:19,130
couple we can save some minutes because i um i messed i'm i
was so bad at the beginning but it's also funny because i'm

5518
05:39:19,130 --> 05:39:24,430
trying to like i'm not trying to remain like faithful to the
original it's just that i feel like the cut scenes work

5519
05:39:24,430 --> 05:39:34,610
better when you don't use like a tranquilizer like everybody
everybody in this game dies it's not it's not a happy ending

5520
05:39:34,610 --> 05:39:56,450
okay shoot what was it okay you nice hey yo hey yo hey yo
ouch oh uh palkey and it's hot baby oh it's on fire it's

5521
05:39:56,450 --> 05:40:05,410
it's hot they die in MGS three, two, a big die from
explosion.

5522
05:40:06,150 --> 05:40:06,910
So it doesn't matter.

5523
05:40:08,230 --> 05:40:09,910
It doesn't matter what I do.

5524
05:40:10,250 --> 05:40:13,350
Reach, thank you.

5525
05:40:15,290 --> 05:40:17,310
Hatty has her own route and occupants drive.

5526
05:40:17,530 --> 05:40:18,290
I have!

5527
05:40:18,650 --> 05:40:21,330
Also, the Metal Gear saw...

5528
05:40:21,330 --> 05:40:21,810
Oh, hold on.

5529
05:40:22,010 --> 05:40:23,230
I'll read it, Reach, in a second.

5530
05:40:24,950 --> 05:40:26,130
Okay, so what's up?

5531
05:40:26,510 --> 05:40:28,150
I've got a good friend in the Pentagon.

5532
05:40:28,630 --> 05:40:28,990
Yeah.

5533
05:40:29,350 --> 05:40:29,650
Yeah.

5534
05:40:29,850 --> 05:40:31,490
He's the one who told me about it.

5535
05:40:31,510 --> 05:40:31,810
Yeah.

5536
05:40:31,930 --> 05:40:39,570
It looks like the DIA recently developed a new type of
assassination weapon an assassination weapon snake have you

5537
05:40:39,570 --> 05:40:47,470
ever heard of something called Fox die no that's what they
mentioned earlier Fox die Fox yeah liquid in the others were

5538
05:40:47,470 --> 05:40:54,250
talking about it yeah they the others it's some kind of one
other the target specific people also I don't know all the

5539
05:40:54,250 --> 05:41:02,350
details but what are you trying to say yeah what are you
trying it's too similar what is the cause of death didn't

5540
05:41:02,350 --> 05:41:10,150
the arms tech president the DARPA chief I mean decoy octopus
die of something that looked like a heart attack yeah well

5541
05:41:10,150 --> 05:41:19,730
apparently Fox die kills its victims by simulating a heart
attack no no you're telling me that Naomi was behind it

5542
05:41:19,730 --> 05:41:27,530
snake try to remember did Naomi give you some kind of
injection the nanomachines the nanomachines she was in the

5543
05:41:27,530 --> 05:41:33,950
best position to have done it but I don't know what her
motive was oh my god does the Colonel know I'm not sure but

5544
05:41:33,950 --> 05:41:44,070
he still hasn't questioned Janai Fox died Janai Colonel
what's new with the Naomi situation I just placed Naomi on

5545
05:41:44,070 --> 05:41:51,990
the air take her butt to jail she was sending coded messages
toward the Alaskan base I didn't want to believe it but she

5546
05:41:51,990 --> 05:41:59,190
must be working with the terrorists oh my god I'm afraid so
oh my god she's being interrogated now she's working with

5547
05:41:59,190 --> 05:42:06,670
them interrogation well I'd like to avoid the rough stuff
but we don't even have any sodium pentathol here that's the

5548
05:42:06,670 --> 05:42:15,590
true stuff right find out anything so it's true isn't it
Naomi Fox alive I can't believe it that means the Fox die

5549
05:42:15,590 --> 05:42:24,070
vaccine must be around somewhere is that all you think about
but snake you might be infected too you know all I can do is

5550
05:42:24,070 --> 05:42:35,030
leave it up to the Colonel I mean I mean I mean I don't know
I mean I think it's pretty important to think about that's

5551
05:42:35,030 --> 05:42:45,690
the last one hurry to the control room I'm on my way I'm on
my way master master I'm doing it so Naomi is a spy just

5552
05:42:45,690 --> 05:42:54,710
like I thought Campbell is hiding something too yes but
that's okay Fox die is a virus a biological weapon there

5553
05:42:54,710 --> 05:43:01,970
must be a vaccine we can worry about getting that later
snake but right now you've got to focus on re-inputting

5554
05:43:04,090 --> 05:43:06,530
Yeah, there's gotta be a...

5555
05:43:06,530 --> 05:43:09,570
There's gotta be a vaccine.

5556
05:43:11,390 --> 05:43:12,690
You're up soon.

5557
05:43:13,290 --> 05:43:19,030
Important to note, this was originally an elevator scene for
backtracking, but because of skipping in Twin Snakes, they

5558
05:43:19,030 --> 05:43:19,730
put it here.

5559
05:43:20,570 --> 05:43:21,650
Oh, yeah!

5560
05:43:24,130 --> 05:43:25,410
Yes, yes!

5561
05:43:26,150 --> 05:43:29,930
I love going in the elevator and getting all the exposition
and everything.

5562
05:43:30,070 --> 05:43:30,550
So fun.

5563
05:43:31,190 --> 05:43:31,790
Hey, auto-climb.

5564
05:43:33,830 --> 05:43:35,530
Naomi's an enemy spy?

5565
05:43:36,350 --> 05:43:37,230
I can't believe it.

5566
05:43:37,330 --> 05:43:38,730
You don't even know her, Otakon.

5567
05:43:38,830 --> 05:43:40,690
I believe her, but...

5568
05:43:40,690 --> 05:43:42,250
Snake, leave it to Colonel Kami.

5569
05:43:42,250 --> 05:43:42,670
You don't know her.

5570
05:43:43,050 --> 05:43:46,470
You've got to concentrate on re-inputting that detonation
code.

5571
05:43:46,590 --> 05:43:46,850
Yeah.

5572
05:43:46,870 --> 05:43:47,410
You're right.

5573
05:43:47,570 --> 05:43:47,830
Yeah.

5574
05:43:48,050 --> 05:43:52,070
We gotta stop Metal Gear Rex from launching, for sure.

5575
05:43:54,250 --> 05:43:55,170
What is it, Snake?

5576
05:43:55,970 --> 05:43:56,630
Good luck, Snake.

5577
05:43:56,810 --> 05:43:57,230
Thank you.

5578
05:43:57,330 --> 05:43:58,050
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

5579
05:43:58,050 --> 05:43:58,790
You know what?

5580
05:43:58,790 --> 05:43:59,410
We don't need to say it.

5581
05:43:59,470 --> 05:43:59,690
We're fine.

5582
05:44:00,790 --> 05:44:01,050
All right.

5583
05:44:01,670 --> 05:44:02,310
Let's go.

5584
05:44:06,690 --> 05:44:15,770
oh okay good I was like wait a second it's it's it's purple
but no it's red we're good let's go stop Metal Gear from

5585
05:44:15,770 --> 05:44:31,350

how'd you get this number Naomi what the hell what the hell

5586
05:44:33,550 --> 05:44:43,270
on a different codec Naomi is what the colonel says true yes
but not everything I said was a lie who are you who are you

5587
05:44:43,270 --> 05:44:51,630
I don't know anything my parents face is my name the name
and idea I have now I just bought but the reason why I study

5588
05:44:51,630 --> 05:45:00,210
genetics that was true because you want to know yourself
right I want to know where I came from my age my race

5589
05:45:00,210 --> 05:45:07,170
anything Naomi Naomi I was found in Rhodesia sometime in the
80s, a dirty little orphan.

5590
05:45:08,430 --> 05:45:10,730
Rhodesia, what's now known as Zimbabwe?

5591
05:45:12,410 --> 05:45:14,190
But you were found by who?

5592
05:45:14,830 --> 05:45:16,370
You were found by who?

5593
05:45:16,710 --> 05:45:18,410
And there were lots of Indian laborers around.

5594
05:45:19,570 --> 05:45:21,630
That's probably where I got my skin color from.

5595
05:45:22,850 --> 05:45:24,090
But I'm not even sure about that.

5596
05:45:24,590 --> 05:45:27,170
Naomi, you're too worried about the past.

5597
05:45:27,390 --> 05:45:27,670
Yeah.

5598
05:45:27,670 --> 05:45:29,910
Isn't it enough to understand who you are now?

5599
05:45:30,290 --> 05:45:30,490
Yeah.

5600
05:45:30,490 --> 05:45:31,870
Understand who I am now.

5601
05:45:32,630 --> 05:45:33,290
Why should I?

5602
05:45:33,550 --> 05:45:44,110
no one else tries to understand me i was alone for so long
until i met my big brother and him him your big brother yes

You brought us to this land of freedom, this America.

05:46:39,490 --> 05:46:40,350
Big boss.

5610
05:46:40,510 --> 05:46:43,010
But then he and my brother went back to continue the war.

5611
05:46:44,730 --> 05:46:45,690
And that's when it happened.

5612
05:46:45,810 --> 05:46:46,970
When we killed him.

5613
05:46:47,150 --> 05:46:51,430
You killed my benefactor and sent my brother home a cripple.

5614
05:46:52,630 --> 05:46:54,810
I vowed revenge and joined Foxhound.

5615
05:46:55,190 --> 05:46:55,730
Oh my god.

5616
05:46:55,990 --> 05:46:57,370
I knew it was my best chance to meet you.

5617
05:46:58,190 --> 05:46:59,930
And I prayed for the day that I would.

5618
05:47:01,090 --> 05:47:11,350
so were your prayers answered yeah how do you feel now huh
yes i waited two long years to kill me is that all you cared

5619
05:47:11,350 --> 05:47:19,150
about i mean two years is long but it's like not that long
two years you were all i thought about for two long years

5620
05:47:19,150 --> 05:47:26,930
rent-free for real twisted obsession do you still hate me
did they read up naomi's lines they read up to everybody's

5621
05:47:26,930 --> 05:47:36,190
lines about you what about liquid in the others I'll have my
revenge on them too yeah Naomi you didn't kill that doctor

5622
05:47:36,190 --> 05:47:43,990
too did you the one that used gray fox for his genome
experiments yeah but they got rid of Naomi's accent that was

5623
05:47:43,990 --> 05:47:53,970
my brother afterward I covered it up now you're so obsessed
with me Naomi so that ninja I mean gray fox he's come here

5624
05:47:53,970 --> 05:48:02,470
to kill me I don't think so I think he just he loves you he
loves you snake I wasn't sure before but now I think I

5625
05:48:02,470 --> 05:48:13,110
understand a final battle with you that's all he lives for
soldiers are so weird they're all just like I need to have I

5626
05:48:13,110 --> 05:48:22,570
need to fight one more time tell me something about Fox die
Fox die is a type of retro virus that targets and kills only

5627
05:48:22,570 --> 05:48:28,650
specific people yeah first it infects the macrophages and
the What's that?

5628
05:48:28,890 --> 05:48:30,710
Fox die contains smart enzymes.

5629
05:48:31,510 --> 05:48:32,990
Created through protein engineering.

5630
05:48:33,130 --> 05:48:36,850
The program to respond to specific genetic patterns in
cells.

5631
05:48:36,950 --> 05:48:38,290
I don't, I mean I know that the...

5632
05:48:38,290 --> 05:48:39,870
Those enzymes recognized the target's DNA.

5633
05:48:40,210 --> 05:48:41,350
Original recordings were bad.

5634
05:48:42,050 --> 05:48:43,270
But I don't think they sucked.

5635
05:48:45,390 --> 05:48:46,990
They have soul.

5636
05:48:47,570 --> 05:48:47,850
They have soul.

5637
05:48:48,810 --> 05:48:49,910
It's a type of cytokine.

5638
05:48:49,910 --> 05:48:50,890
Do you know Jaeger means hunter?

5639
05:48:51,090 --> 05:48:53,150
A peptide which causes cells to die.

5640
05:48:53,590 --> 05:48:54,270
That's a spoiler.

5641
05:48:54,490 --> 05:49:01,390
The TNF epsilon is carried along the bloodstream to the the
heart where they attach one more fight will fix me i can fix

5642
05:49:01,390 --> 05:49:09,290
him and then they cause a heart attack yeah the heart cells
suffer a shock and undergo an extreme apoptosis apoptosis

5643
05:49:09,290 --> 05:49:20,670
then the victim dies scary apoptosis you mean the heart
cells commit suicide this naomi does this what you must have

5644
05:49:20,670 --> 05:49:23,690
programmed that thing to kill me too right you did

5645
05:49:28,190 --> 05:49:28,710
Naomi!

5646
05:49:30,110 --> 05:49:31,790
I don't blame you for wanting me dead.

5647
05:49:33,390 --> 05:49:37,110
Why can't you ever give us a clear answer, Naomi?

5648
05:49:37,110 --> 05:49:39,810
I'm not the one who made the decision to use Fox Die.

5649
05:49:40,190 --> 05:49:40,390
Huh?

5650
05:49:40,950 --> 05:49:41,730
You weren't.

5651
05:49:42,490 --> 05:49:42,810
No.

5652
05:49:43,210 --> 05:49:43,530
No.

5653
05:49:44,090 --> 05:49:47,250
You were injected with Fox Die as a part of this operation.

5654
05:49:48,390 --> 05:49:49,850
I just wanted to let you know that...

5655
05:49:50,830 --> 05:49:51,350
No.

5656
05:49:52,870 --> 05:49:54,210
That's not the whole truth.

5657
05:49:54,690 --> 05:49:55,030
Huh?

5658
05:49:55,030 --> 05:50:10,770
why are you such a pathological liar snake hey what are you
doing no live snake you must live Naomi snake I can't allow

5659
05:50:10,770 --> 05:50:17,830
Naomi to make any more unauthorized transmissions what
Naomi's been removed from this operation what happened to

5660
05:50:17,830 --> 05:50:25,010
Naomi what did she mean when she said that Fox die was a
part of this operation Colonel let me talk to her I won't

5661
05:50:25,030 --> 05:50:27,150
Twist after twist after twist.

5662
05:50:28,290 --> 05:50:29,710
You double crossed me.

5663
05:50:30,210 --> 05:50:31,810
Snake, there's no time for that.

5664
05:50:32,150 --> 05:50:32,770
Right now.

5665
05:50:33,130 --> 05:50:35,250
Your job is to stop Metal Gear.

5666
05:50:35,850 --> 05:50:37,150
You'll die when you die.

5667
05:50:37,610 --> 05:50:37,610
Naomi.

5668
05:50:38,750 --> 05:50:39,590
That's her alright.

5669
05:50:41,230 --> 05:50:42,650
Oh my gosh.

5670
05:50:43,470 --> 05:50:45,290
What do you mean there's no time?

5671
05:50:45,790 --> 05:50:49,550
When I've been injected with like a poison essentially.

5672
05:50:49,870 --> 05:50:50,230
Oh my gosh.

5673
05:50:50,670 --> 05:50:54,150
The camera angle sometimes get me a little motion sick.

5674
05:50:58,930 --> 05:51:01,050
Naomi yapped a little too much.

5675
05:51:02,830 --> 05:51:03,910
Here we go.

5676
05:51:04,710 --> 05:51:05,750
Final pal-key.

5677
05:51:06,190 --> 05:51:06,990
Nice and steamy.

5678
05:51:08,550 --> 05:51:08,810
In it.

5679
05:51:09,190 --> 05:51:10,110
Insert, we go.

5680
05:51:11,210 --> 05:51:13,250
Yeah, there's no time to talk about my double crossing.

5681
05:51:13,610 --> 05:51:17,690
Yeah, he's just like, just get your job done before you die.

5682
05:51:17,870 --> 05:51:19,030
Which is also so sad.

5683
05:51:19,170 --> 05:51:21,570
Snake just being like, I have one friend.

5684
05:51:21,790 --> 05:51:22,590
It's the colonel.

5685
05:51:22,750 --> 05:51:24,050
It's like...

5686
05:51:25,490 --> 05:51:28,530
I think you're just a tool to everybody.

5687
05:51:30,930 --> 05:51:34,650
You know, if you rearrange Rat Patrol, what's that mean?

5688
05:51:34,910 --> 05:51:35,870
Oh, here we go.

5689
05:51:37,670 --> 05:51:38,220
Here it is.

5690
05:51:40,550 --> 05:51:41,250
What?

5691
05:51:42,770 --> 05:51:45,150
Oh my god!

5692
05:51:45,870 --> 05:51:46,570
No!

5693
05:51:46,730 --> 05:51:47,410
Why?

5694
05:51:48,410 --> 05:51:49,110
No!

5695
05:51:49,470 --> 05:51:50,110
No!

5696
05:51:51,650 --> 05:51:52,250
No!

5697
05:51:56,750 --> 05:52:08,270
Welcome to Bembush and thank you I deactivated oh here it is
who's calling master please thank you snake now the

5698
05:52:08,270 --> 05:52:16,230
detonation code is completed master Miller nothing can stop
metal gear now no master what's going on master please you

5699
05:52:16,230 --> 05:52:25,930
found the key and even activated the warhead for us too I
really must express my gratitude sorry to have involved you

5700
05:52:25,930 --> 05:52:32,570
in that silly shape memory alloy business what are you
talking about we weren't able to learn the DARPA chief's

5701
05:52:32,570 --> 05:52:39,790
code even with Mantis psychic powers he couldn't read his
mind then Ocelot accidentally killed him during the

5702
05:52:39,790 --> 05:52:48,050
interrogation in other words we weren't able to launch the
nuclear device we were all getting a little worried without

5703
05:52:48,050 --> 05:52:53,050
the threat of a nuclear strike we're getting a little
worried would never be met why did I launch that nuke

5704
05:52:53,050 --> 05:53:01,410
without the like a fiddle we had to find some other way
that's when i decided you might prove oh my god we're just a

5705
05:53:01,410 --> 05:53:09,050
pawn in everyone's game well for starters i had decoy
octopus disguise himself as the darpa chief oh my god we

5706
05:53:09,050 --> 05:53:16,270
thought we'd get the info from you but there was fox die
yeah you mean you had this plan from the beginning just to

5707
05:53:16,270 --> 05:53:22,330
get me to input the detonation code you didn't think you
made it this far by yourself you're telling me he didn't

5708
05:53:22,330 --> 05:53:30,370
actually regrow that arm in any case the launch preparations
are complete once the world glimpses the power of this

5709
05:53:30,370 --> 05:53:39,730
weapon master I trusted you to surrender the Fox I trusted
you master there ace in the those day Miller Senpai the

5710
05:53:39,730 --> 05:53:53,390
Pentagon's plan was already successful in the torture room
you're the only one who master baited you I can't believe he

5711
05:53:53,390 --> 05:54:01,130
did that are you anyway I'll tell you everything you want to
know if you come to where I am that is there the little jump

5712
05:54:01,130 --> 05:54:14,930
scare of very close by very close by snake that's not master
Miller what Campbell you're too late master Miller's right

5713
05:54:14,930 --> 05:54:21,870
now he's been dead for at least three days master Miller
because my codec link with master was Oh my god.

5714
05:54:22,030 --> 05:54:25,030
But Mei Ling said his transmission signal was coming from
inside the base.

5715
05:54:25,050 --> 05:54:25,910
Why didn't you check the sooner?

5716
05:54:26,170 --> 05:54:27,250
So who is it?

5717
05:54:27,810 --> 05:54:30,050
Snake, you've been talking to...

5718
05:54:30,050 --> 05:54:30,450
Brother?

5719
05:54:30,690 --> 05:54:33,190
Me, dear brother.

5720
05:54:35,130 --> 05:54:35,710
Yeah!

5721
05:54:36,390 --> 05:54:36,790
Liquid.

5722
05:54:37,550 --> 05:54:38,210
How the...

5723
05:54:38,210 --> 05:54:39,870
You've served your purpose.

5724
05:54:40,170 --> 05:54:41,910
Crazy how everyone betrays snakes in these games.

5725
05:54:42,130 --> 05:54:42,930
Glad I never did.

5726
05:54:47,310 --> 05:54:48,890
Dramatic stare off.

5727
05:54:50,350 --> 05:54:50,990
No!

5728
05:54:51,830 --> 05:54:52,470
No!

5729
05:54:52,470 --> 05:54:52,770
No!

5730
05:54:52,790 --> 05:54:55,410
Oh my god, no!

5731
05:54:55,610 --> 05:54:55,610
Uh,

5732
05:54:59,910 --> 05:55:00,630
uh, call...

5733
05:55:00,630 --> 05:55:02,410
Um... Colonel!

5734
05:55:04,150 --> 05:55:04,910
Snake.

5735
05:55:05,890 --> 05:55:05,890
Gas.

5736
05:55:06,570 --> 05:55:07,030
Do something.

5737
05:55:08,890 --> 05:55:08,910
Snake.

5738
05:55:09,390 --> 05:55:09,870
Call Emmerich.

5739
05:55:09,870 --> 05:55:09,870
Snake.

5740
05:55:09,870 --> 05:55:09,870
Gas.

5741
05:55:10,410 --> 05:55:11,330
Do something.

5742
05:55:11,770 --> 05:55:12,330
Snake.

5743
05:55:12,990 --> 05:55:13,270
Call.

5744
05:55:13,750 --> 05:55:14,630
Emmerich.

5745
05:55:14,950 --> 05:55:15,770
Snake.

5746
05:55:16,510 --> 05:55:17,990
Do something.

5747
05:55:18,870 --> 05:55:19,410
Snake.

5748
05:55:22,630 --> 05:55:25,070
Snake, that's bulletproof glass.

5749
05:55:25,470 --> 05:55:27,410
You can't break it with an ordinary weapon.

5750
05:55:28,030 --> 05:55:29,870
Can't you open the security lock here?

5751
05:55:30,210 --> 05:55:34,110
I hope we get the little liquid jump scare as he runs by.

5752
05:55:36,770 --> 05:55:37,250
The...

5753
05:55:38,490 --> 05:55:38,970
Um...

5754
05:55:40,110 --> 05:55:41,070
Very close.

5755
05:55:41,190 --> 05:55:44,670
But that's why he didn't pick up when we were fighting the
Hindee!

5756
05:55:46,950 --> 05:55:47,430
Gas.

5757
05:55:47,970 --> 05:55:50,970
All you can do is wait for Dr. Emmerich to open the door.

5758
05:55:51,590 --> 05:55:52,630
Stay alive, Snake.

5759
05:55:52,790 --> 05:55:53,870
Fox alive.

5760
05:55:56,430 --> 05:55:57,150
Fox alive.

5761
05:56:21,000 --> 05:56:23,040
If only a snake would throw up here.

5762
05:56:23,520 --> 05:56:24,360
Oh no, wait, never mind.

5763
05:56:24,480 --> 05:56:25,720
He would throw up in his mask.

5764
05:56:27,200 --> 05:56:28,440
That'd be awful, actually.

5765
05:56:29,560 --> 05:56:29,900
Um, Arkan?

5766
05:56:31,080 --> 05:56:31,540
Uh, Arkan?

5767
05:56:32,860 --> 05:56:33,520
Uh, Arkan.

5768
05:56:34,880 --> 05:56:35,420
Wait, Arkan.

5769
05:56:37,080 --> 05:56:37,840
Uh, Arkan.

5770
05:56:39,620 --> 05:56:40,460
Arkan, this is bad.

5771
05:56:40,860 --> 05:56:41,000
Arkan.

5772
05:56:41,160 --> 05:56:41,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5773
05:56:41,880 --> 05:56:42,400
This is actually bad.

5774
05:56:42,880 --> 05:56:44,140
This is bad!

5775
05:56:44,220 --> 05:56:45,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my god!

5776
05:56:52,640 --> 05:56:54,760
Come on, hurry up already.

5777
05:56:55,380 --> 05:56:56,120
Hang on.

5778
05:56:58,160 --> 05:56:58,720
Uh.

5779
05:57:00,920 --> 05:57:01,480
Uh.

5780
05:57:06,210 --> 05:57:09,410
I know the gas map doesn't do anything anymore, but Otakon!

5781
05:57:10,170 --> 05:57:11,670
Um, Otakon, please!

5782
05:57:12,810 --> 05:57:13,850
Oh, thank God.

5783
05:57:15,930 --> 05:57:17,310
I hacked into security.

5784
05:57:17,450 --> 05:57:18,070
Thank you.

5785
05:57:18,390 --> 05:57:19,250
Took you long enough.

5786
05:57:20,130 --> 05:57:20,330
God.

5787
05:57:21,850 --> 05:57:23,450
I need to use a ration!

5788
05:57:25,750 --> 05:57:26,290
Okay, here we go.

5789
05:57:26,490 --> 05:57:27,130
I love this part.

5790
05:57:27,530 --> 05:57:29,570
Please, please, please, please.

5791
05:57:30,430 --> 05:57:32,290
Also, we're in for a really...

5792
05:57:32,290 --> 05:57:34,330
We're in for a treat of a cutscene coming up.

5793
05:57:34,710 --> 05:57:35,710
Okay, please, please.

5794
05:57:36,570 --> 05:57:37,910
Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom.

5795
05:57:52,780 --> 05:57:53,600
It sucked.

5796
05:57:54,640 --> 05:57:55,260
It sucked.

5797
05:57:56,960 --> 05:57:59,960
Snake, did you like my sunglasses?

5798
05:58:00,860 --> 05:58:04,140
Oh, you point a weapon at your own brother?

5799
05:58:04,360 --> 05:58:13,260
why did you disguise yourself as master so I could
manipulate you more easily you performed quite well I must

5800
05:58:13,260 --> 05:58:21,160
say I must say although the boys at the Pentagon are
probably saying the same thing what the hell are you talking

5801
05:58:21,160 --> 05:58:28,680
about following orders blindly with no questions asked
you've lost your warriors pride and become nothing more than

5802
05:58:28,680 --> 05:58:37,340
a pawn snake what stopping the We managed to avoid choking.

5803
05:58:38,460 --> 05:58:39,380
A diversion.

5804
05:58:40,720 --> 05:58:44,060
The Pentagon only needed you to come into contact with us.

5805
05:58:44,800 --> 05:58:48,140
That's what killed the Arms Tech President and Decoy
Octopus.

5806
05:58:48,700 --> 05:58:50,100
They wanted to kill them on purpose.

5807
05:58:51,380 --> 05:58:52,420
That's right.

5808
05:58:53,260 --> 05:58:55,020
You were sent here to kill us.

5809
05:58:55,300 --> 05:59:00,140
So they could retrieve Metal Gear undamaged along with
bodies of the Genome Soldiers.

5810
05:59:00,620 --> 05:59:04,340
From the beginning, the Pentagon was just using you.

5811
05:59:04,360 --> 05:59:07,000
as a vector to spread Fox Dye.

5812
05:59:07,480 --> 05:59:07,940
No!

5813
05:59:08,260 --> 05:59:08,920
Fox Dye.

5814
05:59:09,180 --> 05:59:09,680
Fox Dye.

5815
05:59:09,780 --> 05:59:10,280
It can't be.

5816
05:59:10,780 --> 05:59:12,960
Are you telling me Naomi was working with the Pentagon?

5817
05:59:13,180 --> 05:59:13,780
Oh no, no.

5818
05:59:13,900 --> 05:59:15,060
They thought she was.

5819
05:59:15,320 --> 05:59:19,940
But it seems that Dr. Naomi Hunter couldn't be controlled so
easily.

5820
05:59:21,740 --> 05:59:21,880
Oh, thank you for the raid!

5821
05:59:21,880 --> 05:59:22,360
Thank you!

5822
05:59:22,740 --> 05:59:24,780
We've got a spy working in the Pentagon.

5823
05:59:25,460 --> 05:59:27,380
Oh, I'm so sorry, Corey.

5824
05:59:27,380 --> 05:59:27,540
Oh, I'm so sorry, Corey.

5825
05:59:27,700 --> 05:59:30,580
Fox Dye's program just before the operation.

5826
05:59:31,180 --> 05:59:33,960
But no one knows how or why.

5827
05:59:34,660 --> 05:59:44,020
I wonder maybe they arrested her so they could find out the
answer to that No doubt but I had no idea she was motivated

5828
05:59:44,020 --> 05:59:53,840
by such petty revenge We still don't know what changes she
made to Fox dies program Oh, well doesn't matter.

5829
05:59:54,240 --> 06:00:01,120
I've already added the Fox die vaccine to my list of White
House demands Guffle thinks are the five there's a vaccine

5830
06:00:02,140 --> 06:00:04,700
There must be right Yeah.

5831
06:00:05,140 --> 06:00:07,020
The only one who really knows.

5832
06:00:07,400 --> 06:00:07,580
Yeah.

5833
06:00:08,640 --> 06:00:11,000
It might prove to be unnecessary.

5834
06:00:11,900 --> 06:00:12,400
Unnecessary.

5835
06:00:12,840 --> 06:00:14,000
Oh, yes!

5836
06:00:14,140 --> 06:00:14,720
Here it is!

5837
06:00:14,920 --> 06:00:15,140
Yeah.

5838
06:00:15,560 --> 06:00:16,240
Why is that?

5839
06:00:17,500 --> 06:00:21,180
You were successful in coming into contact with all of us.

5840
06:00:21,320 --> 06:00:21,680
Right.

5841
06:00:21,680 --> 06:00:24,440
So we must have all been exposed to the virus.

5842
06:00:24,760 --> 06:00:25,700
You're just young.

5843
06:00:26,140 --> 06:00:31,560
It's true that the Arms Tech President and Decoy Octopus
were killed by Fox Die.

5844
06:00:35,220 --> 06:00:41,760
But Ocelot, myself, and you, the carrier, were apparently
unaffected.

5845
06:00:42,780 --> 06:00:42,960
Why?

5846
06:00:44,260 --> 06:00:46,280
Why is it so extra?

5847
06:00:47,060 --> 06:00:51,140
In any case, if it doesn't kill you, then I'm not worried
either.

5848
06:00:52,000 --> 06:00:55,080
After all, our genetic code is identical.

5849
06:00:55,380 --> 06:00:56,340
It's so awesome.

5850
06:00:56,480 --> 06:00:57,260
So it's true.

5851
06:00:57,800 --> 06:00:59,260
You and I are...

5852
06:00:59,680 --> 06:01:00,540
Clones.

5853
06:01:01,960 --> 06:01:04,340
Oh, he's breakdancing now?

5854
06:01:07,920 --> 06:01:09,580
Yes, twins.

5855
06:01:09,940 --> 06:01:10,160
Twins!

5856
06:01:10,600 --> 06:01:12,380
But we're not ordinary twins.

5857
06:01:12,980 --> 06:01:15,920
We're twins linked by cursed genes.

5858
06:01:16,840 --> 06:01:18,280
Les enfants terribles!

5859
06:01:18,600 --> 06:01:19,640
Les enfants terribles!

5860
06:01:20,500 --> 06:01:21,660
Hold on.

5861
06:01:21,780 --> 06:01:23,300
I got some twin snake gummies.

5862
06:01:23,520 --> 06:01:24,040
I'm gonna eat one.

5863
06:01:24,860 --> 06:01:27,740
I got all the flawed, recessive genes.

5864
06:01:28,360 --> 06:01:32,400
Everything was done so that you would be the greatest of his
children.

5865
06:01:32,400 --> 06:01:44,420
the only reason I exist is so they could create you so
you're saying I'm the dominant one right right I'm just the

5866
06:01:44,420 --> 06:01:52,760
leftovers of what they used to make you can you understand
what it's like to know that you're garbage since the day you

5867
06:01:52,760 --> 06:02:04,760
were born freaking out but I'm the one father chose so
that's why you're so obsessed with big boss some warped kind

5868
06:02:04,760 --> 06:02:17,180
of love huh love it's hate his choosing me knowingly two
sides of the same coin for this i want revenge you don't

5869
06:02:17,180 --> 06:02:27,160
even understand this you who could kill your own real father
you store my chance for revenge now i'll finish the work

5870
06:02:27,160 --> 06:02:27,760
that father

5871
06:02:31,560 --> 06:02:33,660
You had two tries, like when...

5872
06:02:33,660 --> 06:02:34,560
You're just like Naomi.

5873
06:02:36,080 --> 06:02:39,780
Well, I'm not like you.

5874
06:02:43,460 --> 06:02:48,540
Unlike you, I'm proud of the destiny that is encoded into my
very genes.

5875
06:02:48,840 --> 06:02:50,020
He's going full monkeys.

5876
06:02:50,840 --> 06:02:51,240
Oh, oh!

5877
06:02:53,880 --> 06:02:56,240
You missed your last chance!

5878
06:02:57,000 --> 06:02:58,880
You'll regret that forever!

5879
06:03:01,100 --> 06:03:01,980
Uh-oh.

5880
06:03:03,940 --> 06:03:05,160
Uh-oh.

5881
06:03:05,180 --> 06:03:11,940
Snake, come, kneel down to this historic weapon.

5882
06:03:12,600 --> 06:03:12,780
No!

5883
06:03:13,520 --> 06:03:18,620
Consider it an honor, a gift from your brother.

5884
06:03:18,660 --> 06:03:20,180
From your brother!

5885
06:03:20,520 --> 06:03:28,520
Now, you shall bear witness to the demon weapon that will
drag the world into the 21st century!

5886
06:03:30,860 --> 06:03:31,920
Oh, Rex!

5887
06:03:41,240 --> 06:03:41,840
Huge.

5888
06:03:42,220 --> 06:03:43,400
Oh my god.

5889
06:03:45,360 --> 06:03:46,420
Oh love.

5890
06:03:50,690 --> 06:03:52,530
The demonic weapon.

5891
06:03:55,470 --> 06:03:55,770
Wait!

5892
06:03:56,210 --> 06:03:57,730
Oh my gosh, I should have killed those guys.

5893
06:03:57,870 --> 06:03:58,750
They're gonna get crushed.

5894
06:04:00,850 --> 06:04:03,290
Are they still die in their sleep?

5895
06:04:11,230 --> 06:04:13,310
The music's kind of awesome though.

5896
06:04:19,370 --> 06:04:20,130
Kick it's Batman!

5897
06:04:20,530 --> 06:04:21,510
I'm gonna kick it!

5898
06:04:21,530 --> 06:04:37,430
but some kind of metal gear revenge in so it's moving but
how do i stop it it's huge oh my god it's so big after

5899
06:04:37,430 --> 06:04:42,330
zanzibar take one action wipe

5900
06:04:50,320 --> 06:04:55,420

5901
06:05:01,730 --> 06:05:05,730
oh he's so Oh my god.

5902
06:05:06,830 --> 06:05:07,650
Now roar.

5903
06:05:09,990 --> 06:05:12,430
Oh my god, it's so cool to see.

5904
06:05:13,030 --> 06:05:14,010
Oh my god, it's so cool to see.

5905
06:05:14,010 --> 06:05:14,010
Oh!

5906
06:05:14,010 --> 06:05:14,550
Punch it!

5907
06:05:16,630 --> 06:05:16,930
Ow!

5908
06:05:18,970 --> 06:05:20,110
Roll some nectar!

5909
06:05:23,770 --> 06:05:25,650
He's so cute.

5910
06:05:28,090 --> 06:05:28,510
Huh?

5911
06:05:31,590 --> 06:05:32,370
Alright.

5912
06:05:35,610 --> 06:05:36,130
Anyway...

5913
06:05:39,580 --> 06:05:40,640
God help us.

5914
06:05:41,320 --> 06:05:42,120
Metal Gear is moving.

5915
06:05:42,360 --> 06:05:42,360
No!

5916
06:05:42,740 --> 06:05:43,600
You help me!

5917
06:05:44,220 --> 06:05:45,920
It's all riding on you now.

5918
06:05:45,980 --> 06:05:46,720
You help me!

5919
06:05:48,880 --> 06:05:52,180
You'll have to ask Dr. Emmerich, the guy who made it.

5920
06:05:52,180 --> 06:05:54,060
Gotta take out the... First the Radom, right?

5921
06:05:58,220 --> 06:06:00,460
Snake, Rex's armor is impregnable.

5922
06:06:00,820 --> 06:06:03,240
You can't do any damage with the weapons you've got.

5923
06:06:03,940 --> 06:06:06,000
Rex uses the latest advances in combat.

5924
06:06:06,020 --> 06:06:07,800
Can you speak up Otacon?

5925
06:06:07,980 --> 06:06:09,040
I can't hear you over the music.

5926
06:06:11,080 --> 06:06:11,600
Huh?

5927
06:06:12,820 --> 06:06:13,380
The music.

5928
06:06:13,780 --> 06:06:15,980
Rex's pilot seat operates exactly like a VR system.

5929
06:06:16,000 --> 06:06:17,260
We got the chorus back, finally.

5930
06:06:17,760 --> 06:06:21,020
He's got multiple sensors connected to a high-tech interface
used for the controls.

5931
06:06:21,400 --> 06:06:24,920
It's completely self-enclosed and shut off from the outside
environment.

5932
06:06:25,080 --> 06:06:26,800
He's not using his naked eyes.

5933
06:06:27,240 --> 06:06:27,620
Naked eyes.

5934
06:06:28,420 --> 06:06:30,520
So if you could somehow destroy the sensors.

5935
06:06:31,300 --> 06:06:33,500
Do you see that round plate on Rex's left arm?

5936
06:06:33,600 --> 06:06:34,000
Yes.

5937
06:06:36,020 --> 06:06:36,400
Yeah.

5938
06:06:37,460 --> 06:06:38,060
The Ray Dome.

5939
06:06:38,060 --> 06:06:41,680
If you can destroy that thing, it won't be able to use its
electronic equipment.

5940
06:06:41,820 --> 06:06:44,240
It's so funny, because when I was putting together...

5941
06:06:44,240 --> 06:06:46,400
Try to hit that Ray Dome with a Stinger missile.

5942
06:06:46,620 --> 06:06:46,800
Okay.

5943
06:06:47,040 --> 06:06:48,160
So will that stop it?

5944
06:06:48,980 --> 06:06:49,120
No.

5945
06:06:49,960 --> 06:06:50,080
No.

5946
06:06:52,380 --> 06:06:52,780
Um...

5947
06:06:52,780 --> 06:06:53,940
Oh, great.

5948
06:06:54,140 --> 06:06:57,060
The part that looks like a beak is where the pilot seat is.

5949
06:06:57,460 --> 06:06:59,240
In an emergency, it will open up.

5950
06:06:59,320 --> 06:06:59,920
But I could...

5951
06:06:59,920 --> 06:07:04,160
I knew how to put it together because I was like, oh, the
Ray Dome is on its left shoulder.

5952
06:07:06,260 --> 06:07:14,160
story yeah i get it first i destroy the raid open that will
force him to open up the pilot seat right if you can shoot a

5953
06:07:14,160 --> 06:07:21,100
missile into the cockpit you'll destroy the computer control
system you intentionally designed it with a weak point it's

5954
06:07:21,100 --> 06:07:27,660
not a weak point more like a weakness a weakness people and
weapons just aren't very appealing without a weakness of

5955
06:07:27,660 --> 06:07:34,940
some kind so true oticon i guess so i owe you one oticon i
mean you can't make something entirely like perfect right

5956
06:07:36,600 --> 06:07:37,480
something perfect.

5957
06:07:38,180 --> 06:07:43,820
I need bet takers on how many tries it'll take her to beat
the Zans of our shuffle.

5958
06:07:44,540 --> 06:07:44,980

The rations, yeah.

06:10:46,850 --> 06:10:49,610
This is my fault.

5987
06:10:49,810 --> 06:10:50,210
This is my fault.

5988
06:10:50,290 --> 06:10:50,950
I should have noticed.

5989
06:10:52,190 --> 06:10:53,850

5999
06:11:54,270 --> 06:11:55,830
Was Gray Fox?

6000
06:11:58,010 --> 06:12:01,150
He was... He was Deep Throat the whole time!

6001
06:12:02,630 --> 06:12:04,190
Gray Fox was deep throating me!

6002
06:12:04,770 --> 06:12:06,010
Sorry, calling me as Deep Throat!

6003
06:12:18,910 --> 06:12:19,550
Nice.

6004
06:12:20,030 --> 06:12:21,090
Fox, why?

6005
06:12:21,870 --> 06:12:23,030
What do you want from me?

6006
06:12:24,850 --> 06:12:26,870
I'm a prisoner of death.

6007
06:12:28,570 --> 06:12:39,030

on taking revenge for you my chat just broke Naomi you are

one who killed her parents oh I was young then and couldn't

6010
06:12:59,270 --> 06:12:59,450
Uh-oh.

6011
06:12:59,450 --> 06:13:02,890
I felt so bad that I decided to take her with me.

6012
06:13:03,590 --> 06:13:06,010
I raised her like she was my own blood.

6013
06:13:06,070 --> 06:13:07,410
Sorry, I'll have no chat for a minute.

6014
06:13:07,830 --> 06:13:08,870
To soothe my guilty conscience.

6015
06:13:09,050 --> 06:13:09,310
To read.

6016
06:13:09,990 --> 06:13:13,590
Even now, she thinks of me as her brother.

6017
06:13:14,550 --> 06:13:15,230
Oh, what?

6018
06:13:16,730 --> 06:13:20,690
Outwardly, we may have seemed like contented brother and
sister.

6019
06:13:21,570 --> 06:13:22,210
But you.

6020
06:13:22,350 --> 06:13:26,790
But every time I looked into her eyes, I trembled with fear.

6021
06:13:26,890 --> 06:13:27,210
We're back.

6022
06:13:29,590 --> 06:13:31,230
Tell her for me.

6023
06:13:32,350 --> 06:13:34,530
Tell her that I was the one who did it.

6024
06:13:36,450 --> 06:13:38,190
There you are!

6025
06:13:38,450 --> 06:13:38,710
No!

6026
06:13:41,330 --> 06:13:41,970
Oh!

6027
06:13:42,550 --> 06:13:42,650
Oh!

6028
06:13:43,290 --> 06:13:44,930
We're just about out of time.

6029
06:13:45,670 --> 06:13:47,690
Here's a final present from Deep Throat.

6030
06:13:48,290 --> 06:13:49,970
I'll stop it from moving.

6031
06:13:55,070 --> 06:13:57,330
What kind of present is it?

6032
06:14:09,090 --> 06:14:10,430
Oh my god, so awesome.

6033
06:14:11,050 --> 06:14:12,990
Oh yeah, you dodge those missiles.

6034
06:14:13,970 --> 06:14:14,390
Yeah!

6035
06:14:16,350 --> 06:14:19,190
Okay, this isn't gonna stop it from shooting.

6036
06:14:21,770 --> 06:14:21,910
Oh!

6037
06:14:22,090 --> 06:14:22,450
Oh!

6038
06:14:35,510 --> 06:14:36,770
Oh my god.

6039
06:14:37,210 --> 06:14:37,510
Ah!

6040
06:14:40,490 --> 06:14:40,970
Ah!

6041
06:14:46,430 --> 06:14:48,130
Oh my god, Fox!

6042
06:14:48,210 --> 06:14:49,330
He doesn't look so good.

6043
06:14:49,430 --> 06:14:50,750
Oh no, he doesn't look so good.

6044
06:14:54,450 --> 06:15:04,310
oh my god oh my god in the middle east we don't hunt foxes

6047
06:15:22,410 --> 06:15:23,730
He's so awesome.

6048
06:15:35,350 --> 06:15:35,910
Yeah!

6049
06:15:43,080 --> 06:15:46,500
He had that the whole time and just never used it.

6050
06:15:48,200 --> 06:15:49,140
It's our turn.

6051
06:15:50,340 --> 06:15:50,760
Oh god.

6052
06:15:51,040 --> 06:15:51,520
Wait a second.

6053
06:15:54,380 --> 06:15:54,940
Wait.

6054
06:15:55,660 --> 06:15:55,960
Wait.

6055
06:15:56,220 --> 06:15:57,240
He destroyed the Raido.

6056
06:16:08,830 --> 06:16:09,750
Impressive!

6057
06:16:10,610 --> 06:16:16,310
You are indeed worthy of the code name Fox, but now you're
finished!

6058
06:16:18,090 --> 06:16:20,770
Now, fire the Stinger!

6059
06:16:21,230 --> 06:16:21,710
Fox!

6060
06:16:22,170 --> 06:16:24,310
Can you really shoot?

6061
06:16:24,570 --> 06:16:26,270
You'll kill him too!

6062
06:16:26,530 --> 06:16:28,450
I can't do it.

6063
06:16:28,690 --> 06:16:30,930
No, I can't do it.

6064
06:16:31,350 --> 06:16:36,470
Now, in front of you, I can finally die!

6065
06:16:39,910 --> 06:16:40,840
After Zanzibar...

6066
06:16:41,150 --> 06:16:42,130
Zanzibar Land?!

6067
06:16:42,130 --> 06:16:43,790
I was taken from the battle.

6068
06:16:44,290 --> 06:16:48,090
Neither truly alive, nor truly dead.

6069
06:16:48,890 --> 06:16:49,710
It's no good.

6070
06:16:49,950 --> 06:16:50,410
It's no good.

6071
06:16:51,090 --> 06:16:51,910
I can't do it.

6072
06:16:52,070 --> 06:16:52,690
It's no good.

6073
06:16:53,210 --> 06:16:54,190
I can't do it.

6074
06:16:54,490 --> 06:16:55,250
It's no good.

6075
06:16:55,590 --> 06:16:57,310
After Zanzibar Land.

6076
06:16:58,470 --> 06:16:59,570
They changed it.

6077
06:17:07,390 --> 06:17:09,530
They changed to Zanzibar Land.

6078
06:17:09,970 --> 06:17:10,230
Oh no.

6079
06:17:10,590 --> 06:17:11,870
Oh I don't think I can watch this.

6080
06:17:11,990 --> 06:17:12,350
Oh my god.

6081
06:17:13,450 --> 06:17:14,290
Oh!

6082
06:17:14,850 --> 06:17:15,490
Fox!

6083
06:17:16,930 --> 06:17:18,010
Oh my god.

6084
06:17:25,000 --> 06:17:25,960
Snake!

6085
06:17:27,340 --> 06:17:30,560
We're not tools of the government or anyone else.

6086
06:17:32,640 --> 06:17:34,220
Fighting was the only thing.

6087
06:17:34,860 --> 06:17:37,180
The only thing I was good at.

6088
06:17:38,380 --> 06:17:43,940
But at least, I always fought for what I believed in.

6089
06:17:47,100 --> 06:17:48,060
Snake!

6090
06:17:51,100 --> 06:17:52,060

6091
06:17:56,470 --> 06:17:59,270

What are you doing?

6105
06:20:03,740 --> 06:20:04,640
Oh my gosh.

6106
06:20:09,640 --> 06:20:10,040
Where?

6107
06:20:10,040 --> 06:20:10,900
There, there, there, there.

6108
06:20:14,560 --> 06:20:15,760
Why are you just yelling?

6109
06:20:17,300 --> 06:20:17,560
Ah!

6110
06:20:28,610 --> 06:20:29,850
That should be me.

6111
06:20:30,330 --> 06:20:31,530
Oh, wait, right there.

6112
06:20:31,710 --> 06:20:32,910
Right, right there, please.

6113
06:20:36,210 --> 06:20:37,110
Oh my god.

6114
06:20:38,490 --> 06:20:39,730
Did that hit?

6115
06:20:39,930 --> 06:20:41,070
I don't know, actually.

6116
06:20:43,190 --> 06:20:43,430
Ah!

6117
06:20:44,270 --> 06:20:44,530
Ah!

6118
06:20:45,870 --> 06:20:46,890
I don't think it did.

6119
06:20:47,770 --> 06:20:48,430
I don't think it hit.

6120
06:20:48,610 --> 06:20:49,150
That's okay, though.

6121
06:20:50,830 --> 06:20:52,110
It's kind of...

6122
06:20:59,210 --> 06:21:00,090
Next one!

6123
06:21:11,080 --> 06:21:12,360
Can I get him again?

6124
06:21:12,360 --> 06:21:13,160
Sweet.

6125
06:21:17,960 --> 06:21:18,400
Oh, shoot.

6126
06:21:23,310 --> 06:21:24,530
Run, Snake, run!

6127
06:21:41,270 --> 06:21:43,510
I'll crush you into dust!

6128
06:21:50,580 --> 06:21:52,140
To end, dusted.

6129
06:21:56,680 --> 06:21:58,280
It is truly that this game is easier.

6130
06:21:59,120 --> 06:22:01,520
It is just truly that this game is easier than...

6131
06:22:01,520 --> 06:22:01,600
Oh.

6132
06:22:09,210 --> 06:22:14,250
It is, it's just the fact that this game is easier, but...

6133
06:22:16,690 --> 06:22:19,170
Yeah, it's less janky.

6134
06:22:20,750 --> 06:22:22,590
I knew it, that was nothing for you.

6135
06:22:23,990 --> 06:22:25,210
It really looks easy.

6136
06:22:25,270 --> 06:22:26,150
It's so much easier.

6137
06:22:26,530 --> 06:22:26,990
It's so...

6138
06:22:26,990 --> 06:22:28,050
Oh, there he is.

6139
06:22:28,710 --> 06:22:29,710
It's so much easier.

6140
06:22:33,250 --> 06:22:42,410
late as usual a snake what do you mean as usual do you know
me you're still alive I will die has nine lives as long as

6141
06:22:42,410 --> 06:22:49,630
okay now I think this is the real fight it looks like your
revolution was a failure this is the more difficult part you

6142
06:22:49,630 --> 06:22:58,950
destroyed metal gear doesn't mean he keeps people waiting
what are you really after heard of big chongus the

6143
06:22:58,950 --> 06:23:05,590
restoration of the era when warriors Yeah, Merrill is dead
in this one.

6144
06:23:06,750 --> 06:23:08,810
It was his dying wish.

6145
06:23:09,770 --> 06:23:14,630
When he was young during the Cold War, the world needed men
like us.

6146
06:23:17,290 --> 06:23:18,570
We were valued then.

6147
06:23:19,070 --> 06:23:20,590
We were desired.

6148
06:23:21,210 --> 06:23:23,190
You don't have to just be a weapon though, man.

6149
06:23:23,430 --> 06:23:24,430
You can just live your life.

6150
06:23:24,750 --> 06:23:25,290
But things are different.

6151
06:23:25,330 --> 06:23:26,050
Get a hobby.

6152
06:23:26,450 --> 06:23:32,070
With all the lies and hypocrites running the world, war
isn't what it used to be.

6153
06:23:33,250 --> 06:23:38,150
We're losing our place in a world that no longer needs us.

6154
06:23:38,150 --> 06:23:39,330
A world that now...

6155
06:23:39,330 --> 06:23:42,210
Yeah, I wanted to get the ending with Otakon, so...

6156
06:23:42,210 --> 06:23:43,930
You should know that as well as I do.

6157
06:23:44,050 --> 06:23:46,170
There's one specific part that is so funny.

6158
06:23:46,390 --> 06:23:53,050
After I launch this weapon and get our billion dollars,
we'll be able to bring chaos and honor back to this world

6159
06:23:53,050 --> 06:23:54,170
gone soft.

6160
06:23:55,730 --> 06:23:57,370
Conflict shall breed conflict.

6161
06:23:57,830 --> 06:24:03,230
New hatreds will arise, and our own biosphere shall steadily
expand.

6162
06:24:03,250 --> 06:24:04,570
The super baby man.

6163
06:24:04,770 --> 06:24:08,030
But as long as there are people, there will always be war.

6164
06:24:10,650 --> 06:24:12,750
But the problem is balance.

6165
06:24:13,590 --> 06:24:15,970
Father knew what type of a balance was best.

6166
06:24:16,510 --> 06:24:17,850
Is that the only reason?

6167
06:24:18,770 --> 06:24:22,430
Isn't that reason enough for warriors such as us?

6168
06:24:23,610 --> 06:24:25,430
I don't want that kind of world.

6169
06:24:26,170 --> 06:24:26,170
Ha!

6170
06:24:26,690 --> 06:24:27,730
You lie.

6171
06:24:27,890 --> 06:24:28,810
Is it because I...

6172
06:24:28,810 --> 06:24:30,070
So why are you here then?

6173
06:24:30,090 --> 06:24:31,230
Is it because I enjoy all the killing?

6174
06:24:31,410 --> 06:24:33,230
Why do you continue to follow your...

6175
06:24:33,250 --> 06:24:45,390
orders while your superiors betray you why did you come here
well I'll tell you then no oh here I love this part you

6176
06:24:45,390 --> 06:24:57,230
enjoy all the killing that's why what are you denying it
haven't you already killed most of my comrades the mocap

6177
06:24:57,230 --> 06:25:07,330
actor is so great the hand flare i watched your face as you
delivered the coup de grace no you didn't oh it reflected

6178
06:25:07,330 --> 06:25:17,750
such vitality yes you're wrong why did you strip me why did
you strip me liquid you don't have to deny it why did you

6179
06:25:17,750 --> 06:25:21,950
take off my shirt to be that way created

6180
06:25:28,710 --> 06:25:37,610
children that's what the project was called they're on fun
telly in the 1970s their plan was to artificially create the

6181
06:25:37,610 --> 06:25:46,210
most powerful soldier possible the person that they chose as
the model was a man no then is the greatest living soldier

6182
06:25:46,210 --> 06:25:57,350
in the world so weird big boss but father was wounded in
combat and already in the coma when they brought him in

6183
06:25:57,350 --> 06:26:07,630
what's they created us from his cells with the combination
of 20th century analog cloning and the super baby method

6184
06:26:07,630 --> 06:26:18,910
super baby method they fertilized an egg with one of
father's cells and then let it divide into eight clone

6185
06:26:18,910 --> 06:26:30,770
babies I ate the other babies the clones to someone's uterus
and later intentionally aborted strong fetal growth I don't

6186
06:26:30,770 --> 06:26:40,070
that's you and I were originally octoplets octoplets we
could have had more the other six of our brothers was

6187
06:26:40,070 --> 06:26:53,030
sacrificed to make us we could have had gassy snake oh gassy
a snake oh my god so it was you and I two fertilized eggs

6188
06:26:53,030 --> 06:26:58,590
with exactly the same DNA but they weren't finished yet.

6189
06:26:59,750 --> 06:27:08,910
They used me as a guinea pig to create a phenotype in which
all of the dominant genes were expressed to create you.

6190
06:27:09,750 --> 06:27:09,750
You.

6191
06:27:09,810 --> 06:27:11,930
I got all the recessive genes.

6192
06:27:12,450 --> 06:27:13,810
You're too obsessed with your genes.

6193
06:27:14,130 --> 06:27:16,250
You took everything from me before I was even born.

6194
06:27:16,330 --> 06:27:17,910
You're too obsessed with the genes.

6195
06:27:19,030 --> 06:27:22,510
But you and I aren't his only children.

6196
06:27:23,030 --> 06:27:23,370
Oh no.

6197
06:27:23,650 --> 06:27:23,650
What?

6198
06:27:24,410 --> 06:27:25,950
The genome soldiers.

6199
06:27:26,590 --> 06:27:38,670
They too carrying on his genetic legacy but unlike us they
carry it digitally with the completion of the human genome

6200
06:27:38,670 --> 06:27:48,950
project in the last century the mysteries of humanity were
made bad thanks to father's DNA they were able to identify

6201
06:27:48,950 --> 06:28:01,670
more than 60 soldier genes responsible for everything from
strategic thinking to Those soldier genes were transplanted,

6202
06:28:01,970 --> 06:28:07,210
using gene therapy, into the members of the next
generation's special forces.

6203
06:28:08,130 --> 06:28:10,010
That's how they became the Genome Soldiers.

6204
06:28:10,030 --> 06:28:11,790
Play Metal Gear Acid 1 and 2.

6205
06:28:11,950 --> 06:28:13,990
I know a little bit about the story of Acid 1 and 2.

6206
06:28:14,450 --> 06:28:15,390
That's right.

6207
06:28:15,990 --> 06:28:23,930
The Genome Soldiers that you've been killing right and left
are our brothers with the same genes as ours.

6208
06:28:24,450 --> 06:28:25,850
The Genome Soldiers.

6209
06:28:25,990 --> 06:28:27,370
The Genome Soldiers?

6210
06:28:28,210 --> 06:28:30,370
They are misshapen creatures.

6211
06:28:30,590 --> 06:28:33,050
When he grins or shows teeth, he reminds me of Willem DeVoe.

6212
06:28:33,910 --> 06:28:36,110
They are our blood brothers.

6213
06:28:36,710 --> 06:28:39,430
And they were born of many an ultimate sacrifice.

6214
06:28:40,190 --> 06:28:41,730
Good thing Solid Snake doesn't smile.

6215
06:28:46,440 --> 06:28:47,800
Human experiments.

6216
06:28:48,260 --> 06:28:50,060
Ooh, I see, looking at me like that.

6217
06:28:51,400 --> 06:28:54,300
1991, the Gulf War.

6218
06:28:55,040 --> 06:28:59,020
The military secretly injected soldiers with the soldier
genes.

6219
06:28:59,580 --> 06:29:00,560
Real footage.

6220
06:29:00,660 --> 06:29:05,300
The Gulf War syndrome that hundreds of thousands of
returning soldiers complained about.

6221
06:29:05,500 --> 06:29:05,960
Real people!

6222
06:29:05,980 --> 06:29:08,380
There's a side effect of it.

6223
06:29:08,620 --> 06:29:08,820
Ha!

6224
06:29:09,380 --> 06:29:09,940
Flash!

6225
06:29:11,340 --> 06:29:11,660
Flash being!

6226
06:29:12,020 --> 06:29:13,840
Was caused by exposure to pesticides.

6227
06:29:14,280 --> 06:29:17,320
And radiation from depleted uranium rounds.

6228
06:29:17,720 --> 06:29:18,020
Ha!

6229
06:29:18,500 --> 06:29:19,220
Idiot.

6230
06:29:19,500 --> 06:29:21,580
That was just a cover story.

6231
06:29:21,860 --> 06:29:23,240
Issued by the Pentagon.

6232
06:29:24,740 --> 06:29:28,560
First they tried to say it was post-traumatic stress
disorder.

6233
06:29:28,560 --> 06:29:31,840
than chemical or biological weapons.

6234
06:29:32,460 --> 06:29:37,000
The poison gas detection units and the anti-Seren
injections.

6235
06:29:37,620 --> 06:29:40,780
They were all just to cover up the secret genetic
experiments.

6236
06:29:40,940 --> 06:29:41,740
They were just crazy.

6237
06:29:41,900 --> 06:29:44,280
They were just getting the genes.

6238
06:29:44,520 --> 06:29:48,080
The so-called Gulf War babies that have been reported by
Gulf War veterans are.

6239
06:29:48,580 --> 06:29:49,000
You are.

6240
06:29:49,000 --> 06:29:49,620
Yes.

6241
06:29:50,300 --> 06:29:53,480
They too are our brothers and sisters.

6242
06:29:54,080 --> 06:29:54,460
The battlefield.

6243
06:29:55,760 --> 06:29:56,160
Absolutely.

6244
06:29:56,400 --> 06:30:04,900
So the genome soldiers mean that the experiments were a
success success don't be a fool they're a complete failure

6245
06:30:04,900 --> 06:30:18,080
we're on the verge of extinction what have you ever heard of
the asymmetry theory nature tends to favor asymmetry those

6246
06:30:18,080 --> 06:30:26,120
species which have gone extinct all show signs of symmetry
isn't the genome soldiers suffer from the same problem real

6247
06:30:26,120 --> 06:30:37,580
signs of symmetry so do i oh as do you this is not real
that's right we are all on the verge of death at the genetic

6248
06:30:37,580 --> 06:30:46,580
level oh my god we don't know when or what type of disease
will occur that's why this is out there genetic information

6249
06:30:46,580 --> 06:30:57,560
you want big bosses dna so you can save your family say your
family what in nature you are the same family members don't

6250
06:30:57,560 --> 06:31:08,340
mate with each other and yet they help each other to survive
do you know why why because it increases the chances that

6251
06:31:08,340 --> 06:31:16,460
shared genes will be transmitted to future generations
altruism among blood relatives is a response to natural

6252
06:31:16,460 --> 06:31:26,680
selection that we will help our blood relatives is inscribed
in our very genes our genes you're telling me that your

6253
06:31:26,680 --> 06:31:36,520
genes are ordering me to save the genome soldiers thanks
rancid rancid your genes it's fate all living things are

6254
06:31:36,520 --> 06:31:46,300
born for the sole purpose of passing on their parents genes
oh my god that's whoa whoa what my genes tell me and then

6255
06:31:46,300 --> 06:31:55,640
i'm going to go beyond in order to break the curse of my
heritation it doesn't happen much cake a snake does to do

6256
06:31:55,640 --> 06:32:11,480
that first I will kill you you had every opportunity you
have had every look behind you oh Merl Merl wow Merl

6257
06:32:14,550 --> 06:32:29,050
she looks oh there's a bomb is she alive hmm yeah I'm not
sure she was alive a few hours ago poor girl kept calling

6258
06:32:29,050 --> 06:32:40,130
your name Merrill Merrill stupid woman falling in love with
a man who doesn't even have a name I have a name yeah we

6259
06:32:40,130 --> 06:32:49,770
have no past no future if we did our fate is nothing but
what is determined in the genes we inherited from our

6260
06:32:49,770 --> 06:32:50,550
father.

6261
06:32:51,650 --> 06:32:52,530
Let Meryl go.

6262
06:32:52,590 --> 06:32:53,410
Let Meryl go.

6263
06:32:53,670 --> 06:32:58,330
As soon as we finished our business, we're almost out of
time.

6264
06:32:59,130 --> 06:33:00,570
You're talking about Fox Die.

6265
06:33:02,410 --> 06:33:06,050
It seems now that the Pentagon knows that Metal Gear is
destroyed.

6266
06:33:06,730 --> 06:33:08,490
They've arrived at a decision.

6267
06:33:09,270 --> 06:33:11,010
They won't even need a BDA.

6268
06:33:12,110 --> 06:33:16,690
If you want the details, why don't you ask your precious
Colonel Campbell?

6269
06:33:16,750 --> 06:33:18,590
Science fiction and historical fiction.

6270
06:33:19,490 --> 06:33:20,690
Which is always fun.

6271
06:33:20,890 --> 06:33:21,650
Uh oh.

6272
06:33:21,930 --> 06:33:23,470
Colonel, can you hear me?

6273
06:33:23,470 --> 06:33:25,770
Uh, Colonel, you have some spawning to do.

6274
06:33:25,930 --> 06:33:27,130
What is the Pentagon trying to do?

6275
06:33:27,570 --> 06:33:29,050
Colonel, answer me.

6276
06:33:29,690 --> 06:33:33,110
The Secretary of Defense has taken over active control of
this operation.

6277
06:33:33,670 --> 06:33:35,370
He's on his way there by AWACS.

6278
06:33:35,850 --> 06:33:36,410
What for?

6279
06:33:36,970 --> 06:33:37,910
To bomb the place.

6280
06:33:37,930 --> 06:33:39,030
Yeah, shut it, Eli.

6281
06:33:39,470 --> 06:33:40,170
Not only that.

6282
06:33:40,630 --> 06:33:43,750
B-2 bombers just lifted off from going to Air Force Base.

6283
06:33:43,850 --> 06:33:44,150
Uh oh.

6284
06:33:44,270 --> 06:33:48,910
They're carrying B-61-13 surface piercing tactical nuclear
bombs.

6285
06:33:49,490 --> 06:33:49,710
What?

6286
06:33:50,290 --> 06:33:50,590
Ooh.

6287
06:33:50,690 --> 06:33:52,010
Metal Gear is destroyed.

6288
06:33:52,670 --> 06:33:54,090
Tell the Secretary of Defense.

6289
06:33:54,590 --> 06:33:55,010
Uh-oh.

6290
06:33:55,010 --> 06:33:59,710
The Secretary of Defense heard that Naomi double-crossed us
and he's worried about Fox's die.

6291
06:34:00,630 --> 06:34:05,710
Now that there's no more danger of a nuclear strike from
Metal Gear, he's going to do whatever's necessary to cover

6292
06:34:05,710 --> 06:34:07,550
up the truth of what really happened here.

6293
06:34:08,150 --> 06:34:13,750
He's going to drop a nuclear bomb to vaporize all the
evidence, along with anyone who knows anything.

6294
06:34:14,270 --> 06:34:14,530
Ah!

6295
06:34:15,190 --> 06:34:16,590
I'll stop the nuclear strike.

6296
06:34:16,590 --> 06:34:18,010
I don't know anything, I promise.

6297
06:34:18,010 --> 06:34:25,890
I may be only a figurehead here but I'm still officially in
command of this mission for now order to delay the strike

6298
06:34:25,890 --> 06:34:34,590
it'll confuse the chain of command and for now colonel it'll
give you a chance to escape yeah colonel if you do that it's

6299
06:34:34,590 --> 06:34:41,710
okay snake the truth is Foxhound was already the subject of
an undercover investigation Merrill was transferred to this

6300
06:34:41,710 --> 06:34:48,830
base just before the terrorist attack as a way of
manipulating me those bastards Those bastards.

6301
06:34:48,830 --> 06:34:48,970
I'm sorry.

6302
06:34:49,790 --> 06:34:52,410
They forced me to cooperate in exchange for her life.

6303
06:34:53,230 --> 06:34:54,710
You better get out of there, Snake.

6304
06:34:55,410 --> 06:34:56,050
Are you sure?

6305
06:34:57,110 --> 06:34:58,270
It'll be bad for you.

6306
06:34:58,850 --> 06:34:59,370
Don't worry.

6307
06:35:00,150 --> 06:35:02,510
It's the least I can do for you after all the lies.

6308
06:35:03,490 --> 06:35:03,510
Colonel.

6309
06:35:04,250 --> 06:35:06,250
I'm ordering them to cancel the bombing run.

6310
06:35:06,970 --> 06:35:08,510
After that, there's no turning back.

6311
06:35:08,810 --> 06:35:09,010
Huh?

6312
06:35:09,690 --> 06:35:10,470
What are you doing?

6313
06:35:10,730 --> 06:35:10,950
Ah!

6314
06:35:11,490 --> 06:35:11,910
Uh-oh.

6315
06:35:12,890 --> 06:35:13,370

Me Ling!

6317
06:35:15,010 --> 06:35:15,990
What happened to the Colonel?

6318
06:35:16,170 --> 06:35:17,270
I don't believe it!

6319
06:35:17,450 --> 06:35:17,990
What happened?

6320
06:35:18,010 --> 06:35:18,850
What's happening?

6321
06:35:19,370 --> 06:35:20,190
The colonel!

6322
06:35:20,310 --> 06:35:20,870
Sit, speak!

6323
06:35:21,070 --> 06:35:23,770
Roy Campbell has been relieved of duty.

6324
06:35:24,130 --> 06:35:25,330
I always forget about this guy.

6325
06:35:25,610 --> 06:35:27,070
This is the Secretary of Defense, Jim Eisen.

6326
06:35:27,070 --> 06:35:27,910
Jim Hausman, yes.

6327
06:35:28,110 --> 06:35:29,030
Put the colonel back on.

6328
06:35:29,450 --> 06:35:31,290
He's been placed under arrest.

6329
06:35:31,470 --> 06:35:31,930
Boo!

6330
06:35:31,930 --> 06:35:35,830
For leaking top secret information and for the crime of high
treason.

6331
06:35:36,190 --> 06:35:37,210
Boo, Jim, boo!

6332
06:35:37,990 --> 06:35:40,290
This isn't what you promised me, Jim!

6333
06:35:41,070 --> 06:35:42,470
This is not what you promised me!

6334
06:35:42,910 --> 06:35:46,890
You can't see, but I'm like pretending I'm whacking him with
my cane.

6335
06:35:48,010 --> 06:35:51,690
There won't be a speck of evidence left.

6336
06:35:52,710 --> 06:36:00,270
I'm sure the president would want the same thing The
president ordered this the president is a busy man.

6337

nuclear device Oh my god.

6339

Damn it.

06:36:22,790 --> 06:36:23,750
The genome army.

6343
06:36:24,150 --> 06:36:24,530
Everyone.

6344
06:36:25,210 --> 06:36:29,390
Donald, the DARPA chief is already dead.

6345
06:36:30,130 --> 06:36:33,470
So you didn't mean to kill the DARPA chief after all.

6346
06:36:34,010 --> 06:36:34,930
He was my friend.

6347
06:36:35,470 --> 06:36:38,650
And you could care less about what happens to everybody
else, huh?

6348
06:36:39,010 --> 06:36:45,070
Well, if you give me the optic disc, the other guy, I might
consider saving them.

06:42:37,080 --> 06:42:39,520
Did I get his dog tags again still, or?

6427
06:42:42,940 --> 06:42:44,660
Gotta be, like, a little bit more.

6428
06:42:45,920 --> 06:42:47,200
A little bit more aggressive.

6429
06:42:49,880 --> 06:42:50,680
Oh, ah, shoot.

6430
06:42:56,150 --> 06:42:56,410

06:43:07,230 --> 06:43:07,790
Oh!

6436
06:43:08,410 --> 06:43:11,190
I don't know if I still got his dog tags or not though.

6437
06:43:11,830 --> 06:43:14,310
The camera change is so confusing.

6438
06:43:14,690 --> 06:43:16,450
Is that all you've got?

6439
06:43:20,110 --> 06:43:21,550
Oh my god.

6440
06:43:23,110 --> 06:43:24,750
That was totally on purpose.

6441
06:43:26,010 --> 06:43:27,990
Oh my god.

6442
06:43:28,010 --> 06:43:28,390
Eww!

6443
06:43:29,110 --> 06:43:29,710

6444
06:43:33,260 --> 06:43:34,200

6445
06:43:34,980 --> 06:43:35,500
Oh my god.

6446
06:43:35,860 --> 06:43:36,180
Oh, oh.

6447
06:43:36,640 --> 06:43:37,240
Ouch!

6448
06:43:37,600 --> 06:43:39,060
Oh my god.

6449
06:43:40,140 --> 06:43:40,600
Oh my god, stop!

6450
06:43:44,160 --> 06:43:46,500
Better hurry, it's going to blow!

6451
06:43:46,720 --> 06:43:47,080
Oh, shoot.

6452
06:43:48,900 --> 06:43:51,020
Oh my god, stop!

6453
06:43:51,380 --> 06:43:51,400
Out!

6454
06:43:54,000 --> 06:43:55,640
We're like running into each other.

6455
06:44:04,080 --> 06:44:06,880
Oh, nice.

6456
06:44:15,220 --> 06:44:15,740
Ow!

6457
06:44:16,720 --> 06:44:18,520
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

6458
06:44:18,560 --> 06:44:19,000
No,

6459
06:44:30,740 --> 06:44:33,520
no, you get off my butt.

6460
06:44:52,420 --> 06:44:52,980
Oh, shoot.

6461
06:44:54,020 --> 06:44:55,060
I don't know why I tried to...

6462
06:44:55,060 --> 06:44:57,340
It was like, oh, no, no, no.

6463
06:45:04,050 --> 06:45:04,150
Ah!

6464
06:45:04,610 --> 06:45:05,710
You're out of time.

6465
06:45:06,970 --> 06:45:07,130
Ah.

6466
06:45:09,970 --> 06:45:10,490
Dang.

6467
06:45:11,370 --> 06:45:12,990
That was so close.

6468
06:45:13,210 --> 06:45:14,750
That was so close.

6469
06:45:18,810 --> 06:45:23,230
Yeah, a little jerk.

6470
06:45:23,890 --> 06:45:24,410
Oopsie.

6471
06:45:25,610 --> 06:45:26,810
I hope I still get his...

6472
06:45:26,810 --> 06:45:30,410
I hope I still got his dog tag, though.

6473
06:45:36,690 --> 06:45:36,870
Oh.

6474
06:45:36,990 --> 06:45:37,790
Oh, nice.

6475
06:45:38,590 --> 06:45:40,130
I still ended up kicking him.

6476
06:45:40,810 --> 06:45:41,530
Oh, no!

6477
06:45:42,310 --> 06:45:43,370
Not the counter.

6478
06:45:51,720 --> 06:45:52,580
Oh, my God.

6479
06:45:52,700 --> 06:45:53,800
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

6480
06:45:56,880 --> 06:45:58,220
Stop being so slippery!

6481
06:45:59,320 --> 06:46:00,360
Stop being so slippery!

6482
06:46:02,880 --> 06:46:05,540
Oh my god, why was I doing so well last time?

6483
06:46:06,500 --> 06:46:09,080
This time I can't get a single hit in.

6484
06:46:33,170 --> 06:46:34,450
I'm just gonna redo it.

6485
06:46:34,550 --> 06:46:35,310
I'm just gonna redo it.

6486
06:46:35,450 --> 06:46:36,230
I'm just gonna redo it.

6487
06:46:37,670 --> 06:46:39,010
Oh wait, can he not get me?

6488
06:46:39,290 --> 06:46:40,290
Look at him go.

6489
06:46:42,190 --> 06:46:43,210
Holy shoot.

6490
06:46:43,770 --> 06:46:45,210
He stepped on me.

6491
06:46:50,480 --> 06:46:51,980
He's spam charging.

6492
06:46:52,100 --> 06:46:53,380
Yeah, it's not fair.

6493
06:46:54,660 --> 06:46:55,940
It's not fair.

6494
06:46:58,840 --> 06:47:02,400
Oh my gosh, that was so funny.

6495
06:47:05,800 --> 06:47:09,500
Okay, but you need to stop running all around, you know?

6496
06:47:12,700 --> 06:47:16,160
I gotta kind of like fake him, you know, like that.

6497
06:47:20,240 --> 06:47:21,520
There we go.

6498
06:47:22,700 --> 06:47:25,480
Kind of gotta fake him, and then...

6499
06:47:25,480 --> 06:47:27,940
Oh, fake.

6500
06:47:28,140 --> 06:47:29,520
Fake, fake out.

6501
06:47:30,100 --> 06:47:31,400
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

6502
06:47:32,980 --> 06:47:33,460

6503
06:47:34,000 --> 06:47:34,920
Yeah, then.

6504
06:47:35,980 --> 06:47:36,460
Yeah.

6505
06:47:37,280 --> 06:47:38,640
I'm gonna step on your hands!

6506
06:47:39,140 --> 06:47:39,880
Oh, never mind.

6507
06:47:41,200 --> 06:47:43,720
Okay, I think I do have the dog tags then, because I didn't
show up.

6508
06:47:45,000 --> 06:47:45,820
Oh, shoot.

6512
06:47:55,960 --> 06:47:57,100
Oh, oh, shoot.

6513
06:47:57,580 --> 06:47:58,780
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

6514
06:47:58,940 --> 06:48:00,320
Oh, at least I got the kick in.

6515

There we go.

6519
06:48:56,560 --> 06:48:57,000
Nice.

6520
06:48:58,980 --> 06:49:02,540
Oh, I know he can get me with that move too.

6521
06:49:02,720 --> 06:49:03,780
He'll like get up and kick me.

6522
06:49:05,360 --> 06:49:05,360
Yeah.

6523
06:49:06,360 --> 06:49:08,520
Oh, dang it.

6524
06:49:08,520 --> 06:49:11,120
I knew he was gonna.

6525
06:49:11,560 --> 06:49:11,980
Oh my god.

6526
06:49:15,300 --> 06:49:16,940
You are so annoying.

6527
06:49:17,540 --> 06:49:18,320
You're so annoying.

6528
06:49:25,600 --> 06:49:26,920
Oh my god, I'm gonna...

6529
06:49:27,440 --> 06:49:28,920

06:49:31,180 --> 06:49:31,660
Please.

6531
06:49:36,020 --> 06:49:36,220
Someone!

6532
06:49:36,520 --> 06:49:36,840
So close!

6533
06:49:36,960 --> 06:49:37,180
So close!

6534
06:49:37,280 --> 06:49:37,520
Come on!

6535
06:49:37,600 --> 06:49:37,920
Come on!

6536
06:49:39,320 --> 06:49:40,060
No, please.

6537
06:49:40,440 --> 06:49:40,880
Don't charge.

6538
06:49:40,980 --> 06:49:41,540
Don't charge, I mean?

6539
06:49:42,460 --> 06:49:42,720
Fuck.

6540
06:49:52,740 --> 06:49:54,120
Oh my god.

6541
06:49:54,320 --> 06:49:55,120
So close.

6542
06:49:57,180 --> 06:49:58,700
I'm sweating so bad.

6543
06:50:01,160 --> 06:50:01,640
Oh!

6544
06:50:03,140 --> 06:50:05,880
We trade a Jank X fight for an extra Jank.

6545
06:50:06,600 --> 06:50:08,500
No, this fight was also really...

6546
06:50:08,500 --> 06:50:11,940
I remember this fight was hard in the first one too.

6547
06:50:12,020 --> 06:50:12,780
Because it's so tight.

6548
06:50:15,920 --> 06:50:16,800
Oh, contacts.

6549
06:50:16,980 --> 06:50:18,120
I need to put in some eyedrops.

6550
06:50:22,820 --> 06:50:23,220
Ow!

6551
06:50:26,360 --> 06:50:28,460
Okay, we still have one last little bit.

6552
06:50:29,220 --> 06:50:30,040
One last little bit.

6553
06:50:30,080 --> 06:50:30,820
We're done, guys.

6554
06:50:31,980 --> 06:50:32,880
We got this.

6555
06:50:33,820 --> 06:50:35,300
Just like MGS4.

6556
06:50:35,460 --> 06:50:36,460
I know.

6557
06:50:40,100 --> 06:50:42,820
This is so MGS4!

6558
06:50:43,100 --> 06:50:44,280
Oh my god!

6559
06:50:47,040 --> 06:50:49,200
This part is so MGS4!

6560
06:50:51,400 --> 06:50:53,300
Thank you for the raid!

6561
06:50:53,460 --> 06:50:53,980

Yeah!

6563

Solid, so if you don't want spoilers, Spoilers?

6564
06:51:06,300 --> 06:51:10,900
Well, Metal Gear Solid, the Twin Snakes, but if you don't
want spoilers, maybe head on out.

6565
06:51:11,460 --> 06:51:12,760

Damn, she looks really buffier.

6572
06:51:32,470 --> 06:51:33,730
I mean, I know she is, but like...

6573
06:51:35,150 --> 06:51:35,950
That angle.

6574
06:51:36,630 --> 06:51:36,890
Merle.

6575
06:51:43,040 --> 06:51:43,520

6582
06:52:57,420 --> 06:52:58,180
Tech, tech.

6583
06:53:02,660 --> 06:53:04,320
Oh my gosh, she looks really dead.

6584
06:53:08,340 --> 06:53:09,080
It's okay, Snake.

6585
06:53:09,260 --> 06:53:09,740
It was me.

6586
06:53:10,120 --> 06:53:10,920
I did it.

6587
06:53:11,020 --> 06:53:11,400
Not you.

6588
06:53:11,480 --> 06:53:12,300
Don't take the...

6589
06:53:12,300 --> 06:53:17,180
Oh, I don't like what I... I don't like seeing him like
putting this on himself when it was me.

6590
06:53:17,840 --> 06:53:18,240
Merrill.

6591
06:53:19,320 --> 06:53:20,120
I'm sorry.

6592
06:53:20,240 --> 06:53:20,760
Talk strength.

6593
06:53:20,900 --> 06:53:21,580
Thanks for the tech, I'm dead.

6594
06:53:21,700 --> 06:53:22,340
Forgive me.

6595
06:53:22,640 --> 06:53:23,200
Thank you.

6596
06:53:24,200 --> 06:53:26,260
Merrill can't forgive anyone anymore.

6597
06:53:26,440 --> 06:53:28,280
Okay, you don't gotta say it like that, Otacon.

6598
06:53:28,560 --> 06:53:29,160
Come on.

6599
06:53:31,840 --> 06:53:33,480
She's gone, Snake.

6600
06:53:35,740 --> 06:53:36,340
Because of me.

6601
06:53:36,920 --> 06:53:37,640
No, because of me.

6602
06:53:38,400 --> 06:53:41,080
I guess blaming yourself makes it easier, huh?

6603
06:53:42,300 --> 06:53:45,100
Focusing on that will keep you from thinking about her
death.

6604
06:53:45,360 --> 06:53:46,320
What the hell do you know?

6605
06:53:46,820 --> 06:53:47,640
Meryl's dead.

6606
06:53:47,980 --> 06:53:48,680
I lost.

6607
06:53:49,900 --> 06:53:52,460
So, are you gonna stay here and die?

6608
06:53:53,120 --> 06:53:54,100
Along with her?

6609
06:53:55,960 --> 06:53:59,460
Snake, people die.

6610
06:54:00,700 --> 06:54:02,600
But death is not defeat.

6611
06:54:02,940 --> 06:54:04,240
He grew up so fast.

6612
06:54:04,420 --> 06:54:05,420
That's what Hemingway said.

6613
06:54:07,240 --> 06:54:08,940
I lost Wolf too.

6614
06:54:10,080 --> 06:54:11,240
But that wasn't defeat.

6615
06:54:12,980 --> 06:54:14,660
She and I will be together forever.

6616
06:54:15,480 --> 06:54:17,040
People die when they are killed.

6617
06:54:20,600 --> 06:54:21,880
Together forever.

6618
06:54:29,870 --> 06:54:31,430
It's true that Wolf is dead.

6619
06:54:32,990 --> 06:54:34,810
But our love didn't die with her.

6620
06:54:35,930 --> 06:54:43,090
Life isn't just a game of win or lose Don't you think yeah,
you can start new love.

6621
06:54:43,670 --> 06:54:48,910
Let's live snake together There's a parking lot right next
door.

6622
06:54:49,330 --> 06:54:58,070
We can get to the surface from the way he like dropped down
so fast I released all the security locks It'll be okay We

6623
06:54:58,070 --> 06:55:01,910

6624
06:55:01,910 --> 06:55:12,610
He's gonna Otakon is protecting him you've changed you have
through regretting the past you have to protect the ones

they're destroying things he grew up let him destroy it but

6627

06:55:50,740 --> 06:56:02,880
Merrill I hope you're still watching me oh you'll see if I'm
the legendary man or not okay I the only reason I don't like

6629
06:56:02,880 --> 06:56:04,760
this I think is because it's so sad for snake

6630
06:56:08,940 --> 06:56:22,980
so sad for him I love Snake so much I love him come on
hustle so much Snake it's cold outside you'll freeze like

6632
06:56:33,140 --> 06:56:43,980
not because Merrill died I like Merrill too but watching
Snake's reaction to it makes me the most sad my sneaking

6652
06:58:12,300 --> 06:58:13,120
Okay, hold on.

6653
06:58:13,260 --> 06:58:13,680
Oh, gosh.

6654
06:58:14,640 --> 06:58:15,140
Oh, my God.

6655
06:58:19,030 --> 06:58:19,930
Yeah, let's go.

6656
06:58:19,990 --> 06:58:20,270
Let's go.

6657
06:58:20,330 --> 06:58:20,730
Let's go.

6658
06:58:21,230 --> 06:58:21,750
Oh, my God.

6659
06:58:22,550 --> 06:58:23,490
Uh, hold on.

6660
06:58:23,610 --> 06:58:24,010
Hold on.

6661
06:58:24,770 --> 06:58:26,150
Oh, I'm trying to get in.

6662
06:58:29,490 --> 06:58:30,230
I'm trying!

6663
06:58:34,090 --> 06:58:35,930
How do I use this?

6664
06:58:36,770 --> 06:58:37,230
Oh, shoot.

6665
06:58:37,610 --> 06:58:41,570
Oh my god.

6666
06:58:43,950 --> 06:58:45,190
Can I lower it?

6667
06:58:45,470 --> 06:58:46,610
Wait, can you please?

6668
06:58:46,930 --> 06:58:47,770
How do I lower it?

6669
06:58:48,850 --> 06:58:51,650
Uh, wait, how do, wait, no, seriously, how do I lower it?

6670
06:58:51,770 --> 06:58:52,450
Why isn't it?

6671
06:58:52,710 --> 06:58:55,190
Uh, uh, uh, uh?

6672
06:58:55,930 --> 06:58:57,370
How do I lower it?

6673
06:58:57,470 --> 06:58:57,970
Omnicod!

6674
06:58:58,810 --> 06:58:59,590
I don't know!

6675
06:59:00,650 --> 06:59:01,390
First person!

6676
06:59:01,730 --> 06:59:02,650
Oh, okay.

6677
06:59:03,330 --> 06:59:04,010
Oh my gosh.

6678
06:59:04,730 --> 06:59:08,230
What a mess.

6679
06:59:17,030 --> 06:59:19,890
I'm just gonna shoot ahead.

6680
06:59:23,320 --> 06:59:24,500
It's unlimited ammo anyway.

6681
06:59:28,340 --> 06:59:29,760
Why did it do that?

6682
06:59:35,080 --> 06:59:36,180
I'm trying!

6683
06:59:38,380 --> 06:59:39,340
I got him.

6684
06:59:39,780 --> 06:59:39,840
Oh.

6685
06:59:41,620 --> 06:59:43,500
I'm in a real, like, adventure.

6686
06:59:43,640 --> 06:59:44,020
Oh, gosh.

6687
06:59:44,200 --> 06:59:45,000
I can't see anything.

6688
06:59:45,100 --> 06:59:45,320
Otakon.

6689
06:59:45,620 --> 06:59:45,720
Wait.

6690
06:59:45,940 --> 06:59:46,400
How do I...

6691
06:59:46,400 --> 06:59:46,760
There we go.

6692
06:59:47,900 --> 06:59:48,400
Oh, my God.

6693
06:59:48,480 --> 06:59:50,160
Why do you do that every time?

6694
06:59:50,360 --> 06:59:50,500
Otakon.

6695
06:59:51,700 --> 06:59:52,640
It's not very helpful.

6696
06:59:53,680 --> 06:59:56,780
Snake, I mean, Otakon, I've tried.

6697
06:59:57,500 --> 06:59:58,020
This thing is...

6698
07:00:10,950 --> 07:00:12,810
God, I have, like, no life left.

6699
07:00:13,290 --> 07:00:14,470
Otakon, I'm going to die.

6700
07:00:15,030 --> 07:00:16,150
Otakon, I'm going to bleed out.

6701
07:00:17,910 --> 07:00:19,270
One HP and a tree.

6702
07:00:23,590 --> 07:00:26,470
Oh god, I'm gonna bleed out!

6703
07:00:28,670 --> 07:00:31,330
Snake, it's not over yet!

6704
07:00:32,990 --> 07:00:34,410
It's not over yet!

6705
07:00:34,750 --> 07:00:35,010
Yeah!

6706
07:00:39,930 --> 07:00:40,450
I

6707
07:00:46,230 --> 07:00:48,710
won't let you, I won't let you take my one life left.

6708
07:00:49,190 --> 07:00:50,110
I won't let you take it!

6709
07:00:50,630 --> 07:00:51,610
I won't let you take it!

6710
07:00:54,690 --> 07:00:55,950
Oh, dang it!

6711
07:00:56,690 --> 07:00:57,270
You took it!

6712
07:01:00,970 --> 07:01:02,290
Hey, I'm shooting this.

6713
07:01:02,870 --> 07:01:03,190
Oh my gosh.

6714
07:01:05,170 --> 07:01:05,990
How am I not hitting?

6715
07:01:06,150 --> 07:01:06,570
There we go.

6716
07:01:10,160 --> 07:01:10,800
Yeah, that's right.

6717
07:01:12,360 --> 07:01:12,940
Oh my gosh.

6718
07:01:13,360 --> 07:01:13,780
Oh, ouch.

6719
07:01:15,920 --> 07:01:16,840
Come on.

6720
07:01:18,220 --> 07:01:18,680
Yeah!

6721
07:01:19,560 --> 07:01:20,380
I'm shooting.

6722
07:01:20,460 --> 07:01:21,480
I am shooting your butt.

6723
07:01:21,680 --> 07:01:22,620
I am shooting your butt.

6724
07:01:23,140 --> 07:01:23,680
You cannot.

6725
07:01:25,420 --> 07:01:26,360
Yeah, that's right.

6726
07:01:27,640 --> 07:01:28,580
Put on a shirt.

6727
07:01:29,340 --> 07:01:29,800
Please.

6728
07:01:31,460 --> 07:01:34,420

6729
07:01:49,250 --> 07:01:50,910

6737
07:03:02,420 --> 07:03:03,020
Oh!

6738
07:03:04,200 --> 07:03:05,240
So close.

6739
07:03:06,400 --> 07:03:06,960
Are you okay?

6740
07:03:07,060 --> 07:03:08,380
Are you okay, little baby?

6741
07:03:09,700 --> 07:03:11,180
Is this CQC?

6742
07:03:14,500 --> 07:03:16,580
How many Matrix scenes are there?

6743
07:03:16,760 --> 07:03:17,480
You have to understand.

6744
07:03:17,660 --> 07:03:18,860
I think the Matrix was like...

6745
07:03:18,860 --> 07:03:19,500
Can you move?

6746
07:03:19,860 --> 07:03:20,780
It was so popular.

snake Snake.

6750
07:03:52,480 --> 07:03:56,760
There's less tension here because in the original, they're
trapped under the car.

6751
07:03:57,260 --> 07:03:58,880
But here he's just standing in front of...

6752
07:03:58,880 --> 07:03:59,940
Do something, Snake!

6753
07:04:00,440 --> 07:04:01,880
You can stop him!

6754
07:04:02,600 --> 07:04:02,760
Oh.

6755
07:04:03,480 --> 07:04:04,340

07:04:36,710 --> 07:04:37,220

6766
07:04:41,000 --> 07:04:42,500
Oh, never mind, it wasn't...

6767
07:04:42,500 --> 07:04:43,160
Oh, he's away!

6768
07:04:44,100 --> 07:04:44,680
He's...

6769
07:04:49,200 --> 07:04:50,780
Give it up.

6770
07:04:52,020 --> 07:04:53,820
Oh, oh, he's standing back up?

6771
07:04:54,060 --> 07:04:54,660

6772
07:05:01,660 --> 07:05:02,540

Don't say it, don't spray it.

6777
07:05:37,440 --> 07:05:39,420
Snake, don't...

6778
07:05:39,420 --> 07:05:40,800
What happened to the air raid?

6779
07:05:42,320 --> 07:05:44,380
No stealth bombers in sight.

6780
07:05:44,900 --> 07:05:45,700
The Colonel.

6781
07:05:50,010 --> 07:05:51,730
Chat is so down bad.

6782
07:05:51,970 --> 07:05:52,310
Colonel!

6783
07:05:53,430 --> 07:05:53,970
Colonel!

6784
07:05:54,570 --> 07:05:55,290
Are you okay?

6785
07:05:55,870 --> 07:05:57,290
Colonel, what happened?

6786
07:05:57,870 --> 07:05:59,970
The Secretary of Defense has been arrested.

6787
07:06:00,610 --> 07:06:01,490
Early retirement.

6788
07:06:02,010 --> 07:06:06,010
I was able to get into contact with the President.

6789
07:06:06,830 --> 07:06:07,690
Metal Gear.

6790
07:06:08,130 --> 07:06:10,310
The training exercise, all of it.

6791
07:06:10,770 --> 07:06:13,630
It was all the Secretary of Defense acting alone.

6792
07:06:13,830 --> 07:06:15,010
Of course it was.

6793
07:06:15,350 --> 07:06:15,990
Of course it was.

6794
07:06:16,150 --> 07:06:18,430
What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike?

6795
07:06:19,210 --> 07:06:20,570
The orders were rescinded.

6796
07:06:21,250 --> 07:06:24,630
The F-117s and the B-2 bombers have returned to the base.

6797
07:06:25,110 --> 07:06:28,470
Once again, I have complete authority over this operation.

6798
07:06:29,330 --> 07:06:29,550
I see.

6799
07:06:30,170 --> 07:06:32,950
Your Oshie's graduation is not to me.

6800
07:06:34,610 --> 07:06:36,510
I wonder about that.

6801
07:06:38,210 --> 07:06:39,690
The danger's over.

6802
07:06:40,650 --> 07:06:41,330
Thanks, Snake.

6803
07:06:43,030 --> 07:06:44,530
Colonel, about Meryl.

6804
07:06:45,910 --> 07:06:47,470
I already know.

6805
07:06:47,790 --> 07:06:50,070
Oh, I'm sorry, Colonel.

6806
07:06:51,430 --> 07:06:52,410
Here's where we learned.

6807
07:06:52,950 --> 07:06:54,450
My daughter.

6808
07:06:55,290 --> 07:06:55,470
What?

6809
07:06:56,110 --> 07:06:58,330
I didn't find out until recently.

6810
07:06:59,190 --> 07:07:02,430
I got a letter from her mother, my dead brother's wife.

6811
07:07:02,550 --> 07:07:03,450
You should have told her.

6812
07:07:03,470 --> 07:07:06,010
I was going to tell her after this operation was over.

6813
07:07:06,110 --> 07:07:06,750
No, you can't wait.

6814
07:07:06,770 --> 07:07:07,670

I'm switching over to Naomi.

6830
07:08:45,670 --> 07:08:45,990
Snake.

6831
07:08:46,350 --> 07:08:47,270
Oh, God.

6832
07:08:47,830 --> 07:08:48,370
Sorry.

6833
07:08:49,390 --> 07:08:52,750
I heard about my brother.

6834
07:08:53,050 --> 07:08:53,390
Ah.

6835
07:08:54,410 --> 07:08:54,930
Fox.

6836
07:08:55,290 --> 07:08:55,530
No.

6837
07:08:56,230 --> 07:08:58,330
Frank wanted to tell you something.

6838
07:09:00,490 --> 07:09:05,550
He told me to tell you to forget about him and to go on with
your own life.

6839
07:09:06,230 --> 07:09:07,350
Snake is such a good guy.

6840
07:09:07,530 --> 07:09:08,430
Frankie said that?

6841
07:09:08,830 --> 07:09:09,130
Yeah.

6842
07:09:09,470 --> 07:09:09,470
Yeah.

6843
07:09:09,730 --> 07:09:12,330
He's such a... He also said he'll always love you.

6844
07:09:12,770 --> 07:09:15,510
Snake is such a... God, that moment was so ruined by Naomi.

6845
07:09:15,790 --> 07:09:19,090
Your brother just saved you, me, and the whole world.

6846
07:09:19,210 --> 07:09:20,230
Snake is such a good guy.

6847
07:09:20,230 --> 07:09:22,890
He fought on sheer willpower until the very end.

6848
07:09:22,930 --> 07:09:23,170
No.

6849
07:09:23,870 --> 07:09:24,330
Maybe.

6850
07:09:25,850 --> 07:09:27,890
Maybe now he's finally found some peace.

6851
07:09:28,170 --> 07:09:29,790
Spread false information on the internet?

6852
07:09:29,950 --> 07:09:31,370
My brother was already dying.

6853
07:09:31,470 --> 07:09:31,770
Oh.

6854
07:09:32,870 --> 07:09:42,510
Ever since he fought with you and Zanzib, of our land he's
been like a ghost a ghost looking for a place to die

6855
07:09:47,750 --> 07:09:57,630
Naomi liquid died from fox died too what about me oh boy
when am I can't wait to get some real answers here okay yeah

6856
07:09:57,630 --> 07:10:06,590
to you what do you mean what do you mean Yeah, we have a
vibe.

6857
07:10:06,650 --> 07:10:08,670
It's up to you how you use the time left to you.

6858
07:10:08,930 --> 07:10:10,410
You gave me this virus.

6859
07:10:10,450 --> 07:10:11,110
Live snake.

6860
07:10:12,390 --> 07:10:13,350
That's all I can say.

6861
07:10:13,550 --> 07:10:14,810
Naomi, you gave me a virus!

6862
07:10:15,570 --> 07:10:17,270
How long do I have left to live?

6863
07:10:18,750 --> 07:10:24,870
Each person is born with their fate written into their own
genetic code, inscribed into their genes.

6864
07:10:25,930 --> 07:10:25,950
Naomi!

6865
07:10:26,230 --> 07:10:27,830
But that's not all there is to life.

6866
07:10:28,290 --> 07:10:29,670
I finally realized that.

6867
07:10:31,270 --> 07:10:32,230
I told you before.

6868
07:10:32,850 --> 07:10:34,450
I killed everybody around me.

6869
07:10:34,550 --> 07:10:35,290
in DNA.

6870
07:10:36,370 --> 07:10:38,370
Everybody around me is dead because of this virus!

6871
07:10:38,970 --> 07:10:39,790
Where I came from!

6872
07:10:39,830 --> 07:10:40,750
How long do I have?

6873
07:10:41,290 --> 07:10:45,790
I thought that if I analyzed my DNA, I could find out who I
was.

6874
07:10:46,290 --> 07:10:48,210
Nobody cares who you are!

6875
07:10:49,150 --> 07:10:50,670
And I thought that if I knew that...

6876
07:10:50,670 --> 07:10:51,130
Oh, God.

6877
07:10:51,410 --> 07:10:53,710
Then I'd know what path I should take in life.

6878
07:10:53,850 --> 07:10:57,250
I secretly wish Snake would Princess Carrie Otacon here.

6879
07:10:57,510 --> 07:10:58,370
It's not a secret.

6880
07:10:58,950 --> 07:10:59,790
I just wish it.

6881
07:11:00,230 --> 07:11:01,270
I didn't learn anything.

6882
07:11:01,730 --> 07:11:03,490
Yeah, you didn't learn anything.

6883
07:11:03,590 --> 07:11:03,910
Exactly.

6884
07:11:04,470 --> 07:11:04,910
soldiers.

6885
07:11:06,250 --> 07:11:08,110
You can input all the genetic information.

6886
07:11:08,330 --> 07:11:08,990
Okay, here it comes.

6887
07:11:09,270 --> 07:11:11,870
But that doesn't make them into the strongest soldiers.

6888
07:11:12,190 --> 07:11:13,990
Oh, Atacan, I love this part so much.

6889
07:11:14,130 --> 07:11:19,590
The most we can say about DNA is that its genetic
information houses a person's strengths or destiny.

6890
07:11:19,730 --> 07:11:23,370
And, oh, you mustn't allow yourself to be trained to fate.

6891
07:11:24,050 --> 07:11:25,510
To be ruled by your genes.

6892
07:11:27,410 --> 07:11:29,870
Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.

6893
07:11:29,970 --> 07:11:32,070
Well, you, you, it's... Oh, snake.

6894
07:11:32,190 --> 07:11:32,810
Oh, here he goes!

6895
07:11:33,290 --> 07:11:33,690
Oh, no!

6896
07:11:34,550 --> 07:11:36,550
programmed or not isn't important.

6897
07:11:37,590 --> 07:11:40,430
The important thing is that you choose life.

6898
07:11:40,710 --> 07:11:41,330
Just carry him.

6899
07:11:41,610 --> 07:11:42,510
Just carry him.

6900
07:11:42,630 --> 07:11:43,410
And then...

6901
07:11:43,410 --> 07:11:44,330
Oh no, here he goes!

6902
07:11:46,130 --> 07:11:47,110
Don't you think, Snake?

6903
07:11:51,460 --> 07:11:53,060
I'm gonna choose life too.

6904
07:11:54,880 --> 07:11:58,460
Until today, I've always looked for a reason to live.

6905
07:12:02,990 --> 07:12:04,510
I'm going to just live.

6906
07:12:06,310 --> 07:12:08,210
She just doesn't die.

6907
07:12:10,910 --> 07:12:15,730
Jeans exist to pass down our hopes and dreams for the future
for our children.

6908
07:12:17,850 --> 07:12:20,070
Living is a link to what will come.

6909
07:12:20,470 --> 07:12:22,010
All life is tethered to the future.

6910
07:12:22,330 --> 07:12:25,250
That's exactly why I got this egg egg.

6911
07:12:26,530 --> 07:12:28,210
Because that part is so funny.

6912
07:12:29,310 --> 07:12:30,690
Then the world can change.

6913
07:12:31,030 --> 07:12:33,930
He just keeps going.

6914
07:12:34,070 --> 07:12:35,230
He just keeps sliding.

6915
07:12:35,610 --> 07:12:36,670
The true meaning of life.

6916
07:12:36,810 --> 07:12:38,130
I can't even listen to Naomi.

6917
07:12:38,730 --> 07:12:39,650
Oh gosh.

6918
07:12:40,310 --> 07:12:42,190
Okay, she's finally done.

6919
07:12:43,310 --> 07:12:45,010
This is what Meryl died for.

6920
07:12:46,910 --> 07:12:50,210
Until today, I've only lived for myself.

6921
07:12:51,330 --> 07:12:53,810
Survival has been the only thing I cared about in my life.

6922
07:12:55,390 --> 07:12:56,570
That's not just you.

6923
07:12:57,350 --> 07:12:58,510
That's how everyone is.

6924
07:12:59,430 --> 07:13:03,030
I only felt truly alive when I was staring death in the
face.

6925
07:13:04,550 --> 07:13:04,930
I don't know.

6926
07:13:05,750 --> 07:13:07,290
Maybe it's written into my genes.

6927
07:13:07,630 --> 07:13:08,450
Your genes.

6928
07:13:08,730 --> 07:13:25,870
what about now I want to enjoy life I really do yeah how
about you lot of con me I feel like a new man like how that

6929
07:13:25,870 --> 07:13:35,090
implied that no one was listening to me no science and
technology are fine but the music is so whimsical are my

6930
07:13:35,090 --> 07:13:45,930
interest now sounds good the whole reason i got into science
in the first place was because i was no good with people i

6931
07:13:45,930 --> 07:13:55,730
was scared of them i was scared of life i thought that i
could never understand them because they're so illogical but

6932
07:13:55,730 --> 07:14:04,370
i've finally learned how to like people there's no reason
for me to be afraid anymore you and i are more alike than i

6933
07:14:04,370 --> 07:14:05,310
thought No!

6934
07:14:06,370 --> 07:14:07,570
I'm no wolf.

6935
07:14:08,350 --> 07:14:10,970
But I'm not gonna just stand on the sidelines anymore.

6936
07:14:11,110 --> 07:14:12,090
You're so isomotical.

6937
07:14:12,110 --> 07:14:14,170
I'm gonna stand on my own two feet.

6938
07:14:14,370 --> 07:14:14,770
Yeah.

6939
07:14:15,370 --> 07:14:16,930
I'm not gonna hide anymore.

6940
07:14:18,170 --> 07:14:20,090
You're giving up your stealth camo.

6941
07:14:20,570 --> 07:14:20,770
Huh?

6942
07:14:22,150 --> 07:14:23,110
Oh, yeah.

6943
07:14:23,570 --> 07:14:25,790
Yeah, I've seen this scene quite a few times.

6944
07:14:26,130 --> 07:14:27,210
You can have it.

6945
07:14:29,210 --> 07:14:31,670
Oh god, I'm tears streaming to my face.

6946
07:14:37,250 --> 07:14:38,930
Oh god, I'm crying.

6947
07:14:39,330 --> 07:14:39,550
I'm laughing so hard.

6948
07:14:39,550 --> 07:14:41,390
This is where we say goodbye to my loves as well.

6949
07:14:42,110 --> 07:14:42,810
Oh, I'm in.

6950
07:14:45,050 --> 07:14:46,230
Our new loves, though.

6951
07:14:46,970 --> 07:14:47,710
I mean.

6952
07:14:48,750 --> 07:14:50,310
That's why Snake doesn't say anything.

6953
07:14:51,550 --> 07:14:52,710
Want me to drive?

6954
07:14:53,590 --> 07:14:54,270
No thanks.

6955
07:14:54,810 --> 07:14:55,970
I'd rather do it myself.

6956
07:14:56,750 --> 07:14:57,470
No problem.

6957
07:14:57,670 --> 07:14:59,390
Yeah, your driving was kind of, you know.

6958
07:14:59,390 --> 07:14:59,910
Where to, Snake?

6959
07:15:01,870 --> 07:15:18,470
my real name is David Otacon I'm Hal Dave oh that's right
Hal Hal and Dave that's a good one maybe we should take a

6960
07:15:18,470 --> 07:15:33,370
trip to Jupiter oh god I think it's time for me to look for
a new path at life a new path a new purpose Will you find

6961
07:15:33,370 --> 07:15:33,710
it?

6962
07:15:35,030 --> 07:15:35,790
I'll find it.

6963
07:15:36,270 --> 07:15:37,570
I've already found it.

6964
07:15:37,950 --> 07:15:38,990
I know I'll find it.

6965
07:15:39,450 --> 07:15:41,630
Sorry, I'm freaking out over my own delusions.

6966
07:15:44,570 --> 07:15:46,670
I don't think I'm okay in the head.

6967
07:15:56,010 --> 07:15:57,410
God, I'm crying.

6968
07:16:00,570 --> 07:16:01,610
The 1980s.

6969
07:16:01,830 --> 07:16:04,730
There were more than 60,000 nuclear warheads in the world at
all times.

6970
07:16:05,150 --> 07:16:09,370
The total destructive power amounted to one million times
that of the Hiroshima A-bomb.

6971
07:16:10,210 --> 07:16:15,650
In January 1993, START II was assigned, oh, it was signed,
and the United States and Russia agreed to reduce the number

6972
07:16:15,650 --> 07:16:20,710
of deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 3,000 to 3,500 in
each nation by the end of the year 2007.

6973
07:16:21,470 --> 07:16:26,470
However, as of 2003, there still exists more than 20,000
nuclear warheads in the world.

6974
07:16:48,800 --> 07:16:50,600
Time to reveal my favorite theory.

6975
07:16:50,760 --> 07:16:53,580
The Twin Snakes is actually your retelling of the events of
MGS.

6976
07:16:55,520 --> 07:16:58,260
Always a real treat to see in playing these games and
sharing your passion.

6977
07:17:04,580 --> 07:17:07,560
This song brings back so many memories.

6978
07:17:18,630 --> 07:17:19,310
Yippee!

6979
07:17:21,150 --> 07:17:27,690
It was definitely not as dramatic as maybe the first time I
played MGS1.

6980
07:17:29,310 --> 07:17:32,410
But I still had so much fun with this.

6981
07:17:34,210 --> 07:17:35,750
Congrats on finishing Twin Snakes!

6982
07:17:36,010 --> 07:17:37,270
Pyrobug thinks we're the 10 gifted!

6983
07:17:37,590 --> 07:17:38,250
Thank you!

6984
07:17:38,650 --> 07:17:40,250
It's an absolute riot experiencing it with you.

6985
07:17:40,370 --> 07:17:41,510
I'm so glad we got to see you streaming.

6986
07:17:41,790 --> 07:17:41,910
Yeah!

6987
07:17:42,270 --> 07:17:43,790
I'm so glad that I streamed it.

6988
07:17:57,760 --> 07:17:59,780
I can't hit the high notes right now.

6989
07:17:59,860 --> 07:18:00,800
My throat's still.

6990
07:18:02,100 --> 07:18:02,520
No!

6991
07:18:04,180 --> 07:18:04,620
Oh!

6992
07:18:07,100 --> 07:18:09,420
Almost no tension in the boss battles, unfortunately.

6993
07:18:09,760 --> 07:18:10,380
It's so funny.

6994
07:18:10,440 --> 07:18:13,440
The one that I struggled with the most was the tank.

6995
07:18:14,440 --> 07:18:15,820
The tank of all things.

6996
07:18:18,280 --> 07:18:20,900
But yeah, in this it makes the boss battle so easy.

6997
07:18:24,480 --> 07:18:30,660
But, I think it's also worth just playing because of the
redone cutscenes and everything too.

6998
07:18:31,000 --> 07:18:33,020
Even though some of them I don't like as much.

6999
07:18:33,760 --> 07:18:35,680

This is good, isn't it?

07:18:37,620 --> 07:18:39,240

7004
07:19:15,080 --> 07:19:16,860
This song is so awesome.

7005
07:19:24,640 --> 07:19:25,360
So cute.

7006
07:19:26,520 --> 07:19:27,600
Thank you for the five gifted.

7007
07:19:27,880 --> 07:19:28,160
Thank you.

7008
07:19:28,260 --> 07:19:29,360
Sorry if I said your name wrong.

7009
07:19:31,020 --> 07:19:35,220
I don't know

7010
07:19:44,170 --> 07:19:44,730
the words.

7011
07:19:45,050 --> 07:19:45,350
It's not...

7012
07:19:46,410 --> 07:19:47,330
What's the language again?

7013
07:19:47,430 --> 07:19:47,730
I'm not sure.

7014
07:19:47,890 --> 07:19:49,270
Wow, thank you for the aquasupa!

7015
07:19:51,250 --> 07:19:51,610
No.

7016
07:19:52,470 --> 07:19:53,250
Just found the director.

7017
07:19:53,330 --> 07:19:55,770
Godzilla Final War made all the cutscenes for this game.

7018
07:19:55,910 --> 07:19:57,690
No wonder why Snake kept doing the Matrix only.

7019
07:19:58,090 --> 07:19:58,830
Yeah, exactly.

7020
07:19:59,590 --> 07:20:00,550
Thanks for having had another wild ride.

7021
07:20:00,670 --> 07:20:01,410
Congratulations, I made it to the game.

7022
07:20:01,510 --> 07:20:02,230
Thank you, Fikni!

7023
07:20:02,430 --> 07:20:03,390
Thank you for that, Kusubo!

7024
07:20:04,030 --> 07:20:04,290
Down!

7025
07:20:04,450 --> 07:20:05,330
Thank you for the 20k.

7026
07:20:05,390 --> 07:20:06,170
Thank you so much.

7027
07:20:06,250 --> 07:20:06,690
Gaelic!

7028
07:20:07,430 --> 07:20:08,150
Gaelic, yeah.

7029
07:20:08,710 --> 07:20:09,270
Or Celtic.

7030
07:20:09,490 --> 07:20:09,890
Which is it?

7031
07:20:10,210 --> 07:20:10,610
Celtic?

7032
07:20:12,990 --> 07:20:16,430
Glad you have joined MGS Matrix Edition.

7033
07:20:17,170 --> 07:20:18,330
Welcome back from Outer Heaven.

7034
07:20:18,570 --> 07:20:19,350
Thank you!

7035
07:20:20,750 --> 07:20:21,470
Thank you.

7036
07:20:23,290 --> 07:20:25,270
Oh, man.

7037
07:20:38,940 --> 07:20:39,380
Shirokuma!

7038
07:20:39,840 --> 07:20:40,200
Thank you, brother.

7039
07:20:40,280 --> 07:20:42,600
Thank you, brother.

7040
07:20:42,620 --> 07:20:45,340
Thank you for that.

7041
07:20:45,340 --> 07:20:46,640
Thank you, brother.

7042
07:20:47,340 --> 07:20:47,980
Thank you.

7043
07:20:48,480 --> 07:20:52,500
Of course, we have to wait for the ending.

7044
07:20:53,040 --> 07:20:54,420
Oh, it's one of the enders!

7045
07:20:59,580 --> 07:21:00,460
Thank you.

7046
07:21:01,280 --> 07:21:05,120
It's fun seeing you experience something that was both
familiar and different, right?

7047
07:21:05,980 --> 07:21:08,880
Can't wait to see what other Metal Gear shenanigans you
might have in the future.

7048
07:21:09,280 --> 07:21:12,960
Replays, Delta Acid, Monkeys, Smash, a lot of possibilities.

7049
07:21:13,400 --> 07:21:13,660
Yeah.

7050
07:21:15,880 --> 07:21:16,400
Yeah.

7051
07:21:18,360 --> 07:21:19,400
I gotta...

7052
07:21:19,400 --> 07:21:20,620
I gotta...

7053
07:21:20,620 --> 07:21:22,240
I gotta hold my titles.

7054
07:21:22,640 --> 07:21:23,900
The Metal Gear VTuber.

7055
07:21:24,160 --> 07:21:25,540
Or maybe reclaim it.

7056
07:21:28,980 --> 07:21:30,100
Yanwei, thank you.

7057
07:21:30,300 --> 07:21:32,980
You've seen Mitchell Hammond's Metal Gear MSX animations.

7058
07:21:36,380 --> 07:21:40,280
As of 2023, there are 12,512 nuclear warheads.

7059
07:21:40,740 --> 07:21:41,080
Okay.

7060
07:21:42,700 --> 07:21:43,900
That could be less.

7061
07:21:45,160 --> 07:21:48,880
They wanted 3,000, but, um...

7062
07:21:48,880 --> 07:21:49,400
You know.

7063
07:21:50,180 --> 07:21:51,180
Congrats on finishing the...

7064
07:21:51,180 --> 07:21:52,040
Thank you, Maya!

7065
07:21:54,000 --> 07:21:54,640
Yeah.

7066
07:21:59,920 --> 07:22:02,580
The VTuber to surpass Metal Gear.

7067
07:22:03,680 --> 07:22:05,520
So glad I could return to MGS1.

7068
07:22:05,540 --> 07:22:06,380
One twin snakes.

7069
07:22:06,860 --> 07:22:07,560
Oh, but...

7070
07:22:07,560 --> 07:22:07,920
Twin snakes...

7071
07:22:07,920 --> 07:22:10,180
You mustn't allow yourself to be a gene to fate.

7072
07:22:10,780 --> 07:22:12,280
To be ruled by your genes.

7073
07:22:13,780 --> 07:22:15,860
Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.

7074
07:22:15,860 --> 07:22:17,620
She always has to have the last line.

7075
07:22:17,900 --> 07:22:22,500
She thinks she's the main character when Ocelot is the main
character.

7076
07:22:23,400 --> 07:22:24,660
The important thing is...

7077
07:22:24,660 --> 07:22:25,400
And then Meryl died.

7078
07:22:25,740 --> 07:22:28,200
Meryl walks in to grab a coffee, side eyes on a corner.

7079
07:22:30,260 --> 07:22:31,580
Thank you for the pig.

7080
07:22:31,880 --> 07:22:32,540
Just live.

7081
07:22:32,960 --> 07:22:33,700
Yes, sir.

7082
07:22:35,540 --> 07:22:51,700
unit was wiped out yes yes sir yes sir yes sir those two are
still alive yes sir vector yes sir yes I should become

7083
07:22:51,700 --> 07:23:01,400
activated soon right on schedule yes sir yes sir I recovered
all of Rex's dummy warhead data

7084
07:23:05,680 --> 07:23:08,240
They've all been deleted from the base's computer.

7085
07:23:09,080 --> 07:23:09,540
No, sir.

7086
07:23:09,800 --> 07:23:10,140
Yes.

7087
07:23:10,320 --> 07:23:10,940
Oh, no, sir.

7088
07:23:11,180 --> 07:23:12,420
My cover is intact.

7089
07:23:13,140 --> 07:23:14,780
Nobody knows who I really am.

7090
07:23:16,040 --> 07:23:17,000
Yes, sir.

7091
07:23:17,040 --> 07:23:19,260
Yes, the dapper chief knew my identity.

7092
07:23:19,760 --> 07:23:21,300
What he's been disposed of.

7093
07:23:22,060 --> 07:23:23,260
Yes, sir.

7094
07:23:24,680 --> 07:23:25,140
Yes.

7095
07:23:25,880 --> 07:23:26,280
Yes.

7096
07:23:26,900 --> 07:23:28,200
Liquid is dead.

7097
07:23:29,120 --> 07:23:31,380
The inferior one was the winner after all.

7098
07:23:31,600 --> 07:23:33,540
We were the inferior one?

7099
07:23:34,340 --> 07:23:35,320
Until Leverian.

7100
07:23:35,540 --> 07:23:37,980
and Liquid thought he was the inferior one.

7101
07:23:38,640 --> 07:23:40,700
Of course, the other one thinks so too.

7102
07:23:41,860 --> 07:23:42,900
Yes, sir.

7103
07:23:43,220 --> 07:23:44,300
I agree completely.

7104
07:23:44,960 --> 07:23:49,300
It takes a well-balanced individual such as yourself to rule
the world.

7105
07:23:50,000 --> 07:23:50,720
No, sir.

7106
07:23:51,060 --> 07:23:51,500
Yes.

7107
07:23:51,580 --> 07:23:52,920
No, yes, sir.

7108
07:23:54,760 --> 07:23:55,720
No, sir.

7109
07:23:55,720 --> 07:23:57,020
No, sir, dang it, I missed this.

7110
07:23:57,020 --> 07:23:58,460
Someone knows that you were the third one.

7111
07:23:59,240 --> 07:23:59,760
Solidus.

7112
07:24:00,680 --> 07:24:01,200
Solidus?

7113
07:24:01,380 --> 07:24:03,200
What should I do about the woman?

7114
07:24:03,580 --> 07:24:04,080
Wait, what?

7115
07:24:06,380 --> 07:24:07,560
Yes sir.

7116
07:24:07,800 --> 07:24:08,740
Yes sir.

7117
07:24:09,160 --> 07:24:10,540
The surveillance will continue.

7118
07:24:13,400 --> 07:24:13,400
Yes.

7119
07:24:14,080 --> 07:24:14,380
Yes sir.

7120
07:24:14,720 --> 07:24:14,880
Yes.

7121
07:24:15,860 --> 07:24:16,740
Thank you.

7122
07:24:16,800 --> 07:24:18,100
Mr. President.

7123
07:24:18,420 --> 07:24:19,720
Bye Mr. President.

7124
07:24:20,700 --> 07:24:21,300
Sentin.

7125
07:24:22,580 --> 07:24:23,120
Why?

7126
07:24:33,320 --> 07:24:33,920
Yippee.

7127
07:24:35,860 --> 07:24:38,480
By the way, Vinnie Vinesas knows that you know about...

7128
07:24:38,480 --> 07:24:41,040
Wait, what do you mean he knows that I know about the
Daimler Chief?

7129
07:24:42,460 --> 07:24:43,900
What do you mean by that?

7130
07:24:44,740 --> 07:24:46,140
Oh, there's a whole link and everything!

7131
07:24:47,980 --> 07:24:48,720
Yes, sir.

7132
07:24:49,180 --> 07:24:49,980
Clear code.

7133
07:24:50,520 --> 07:24:51,400
My code is hyena.

7134
07:24:51,820 --> 07:24:52,600
What's hyena mean?

7135
07:24:53,800 --> 07:24:54,860
I got stealth!

7136
07:24:56,200 --> 07:24:56,680
Save.

7137
07:24:57,140 --> 07:24:57,760
Yeah, we'll save.

7138
07:24:58,740 --> 07:24:59,620
Yes, sir.

7139
07:25:00,980 --> 07:25:02,040
Yes, sir.

7140
07:25:02,460 --> 07:25:03,100
No, sir.

7141
07:25:05,040 --> 07:25:07,200
He reacted to a chat message about it.

7142
07:25:07,260 --> 07:25:08,500
Oh, wait, what?

7143
07:25:09,600 --> 07:25:10,420
No way!

7144
07:25:12,560 --> 07:25:13,660
Yes, sir.

7145
07:25:14,420 --> 07:25:15,620
No, sir.

7146
07:25:17,360 --> 07:25:18,440
Yes, sir.

7147
07:25:20,680 --> 07:25:22,920
Oh, that was so fun!

7148
07:25:24,780 --> 07:25:26,580
That was so fun.

7149
07:25:28,280 --> 07:25:29,900
I was still at doing a Mega Tri-Depression.

7150
07:25:30,480 --> 07:25:31,760
Oh, impersonation, yeah.

7151
07:25:37,480 --> 07:25:41,600
I always go on about it, but Game Boy Metal Gear is
essentially Metal Gear 3.

7152
07:25:42,300 --> 07:25:54,260
Acid 1 is the game that is the closet closet close oh
closest to MGS 1 sequel vibes wise I don't know about a

7153
07:25:54,260 --> 07:26:07,280
sequel it's really weird code hyena means you're pretty good

7154
07:26:07,280 --> 07:26:24,580
cow I was watching your videos You think so well Ha-Yan is
an anagram of Henya.

7155
07:26:24,880 --> 07:26:29,320
It was meant to be Yagi Kenya!

7156
07:26:33,560 --> 07:26:35,080
Thank you!

7157
07:26:37,020 --> 07:26:39,140
Oh, there we go.

7158
07:26:39,760 --> 07:26:46,160
Okay, I don't want to wear out my the CDs so much, but thank
you.

7159
07:26:46,720 --> 07:26:47,880
Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes?

7160
07:26:49,480 --> 07:26:51,380
It was an honor.

7161
07:26:54,120 --> 07:26:54,540
What's under?

7162
07:26:54,600 --> 07:26:56,100
Wait, let's see the special real quick.

7163
07:26:56,900 --> 07:26:57,060
Oh!

7164
07:26:57,600 --> 07:26:59,880
I never got a camera.

7165
07:27:01,340 --> 07:27:02,760
How do I get the camera?

7166
07:27:03,260 --> 07:27:03,540
Hmm.

7167
07:27:04,140 --> 07:27:05,220
Boss survival.

7168
07:27:06,420 --> 07:27:07,600
Oh, cool.

7169
07:27:07,740 --> 07:27:08,820
Previous operations.

7170
07:27:10,660 --> 07:27:11,080
What?

7171
07:27:15,170 --> 07:27:16,050
Emo theater.

7172
07:27:17,170 --> 07:27:18,270
Auto-Con chapter.

7173
07:27:26,650 --> 07:27:27,090
Wait.

7174
07:27:28,170 --> 07:27:29,830
Wait, does it have the MSX games on here?

7175
07:27:29,930 --> 07:27:30,570
I had no idea.

7176
07:27:39,660 --> 07:27:40,820
They're definitely weird.

7177
07:27:42,200 --> 07:27:44,340
But the juice is worth the squeeze.

7178
07:27:46,280 --> 07:27:48,360
Oh my gosh, so many that we never got.

7179
07:27:50,660 --> 07:27:52,360
Okay, I have to press manually.

7180
07:27:52,540 --> 07:27:54,540
Go, go, go, wait, wait.

7181
07:27:56,380 --> 07:27:58,040
Oh, wait, uh, normal?

7182
07:27:58,340 --> 07:27:58,920
There we go.

7183
07:27:59,780 --> 07:28:03,480
Oh, oh, there, there, there, there, there!

7184
07:28:11,180 --> 07:28:11,680
Hmm.

7185
07:28:15,790 --> 07:28:16,730
There's only 28.

7186
07:28:19,690 --> 07:28:21,750
The viewer is literally nothing.

7187
07:28:22,850 --> 07:28:25,770
Maybe because we don't have their date of birth or anything.

7188
07:28:26,390 --> 07:28:27,030
It's kind of lame.

7189
07:28:27,850 --> 07:28:28,550
Okay, never mind.

7190
07:28:31,610 --> 07:28:32,610
That's all it is.

7191
07:28:33,610 --> 07:28:35,650
Okay, I'm gonna test this real quick.

7192
07:28:36,630 --> 07:28:36,830
Oh!

7193
07:28:38,990 --> 07:28:40,930
We got baited so hard.

7194
07:28:41,050 --> 07:28:42,090
It's just a summary.

7195
07:28:43,570 --> 07:28:45,890
We got baited so hard.

7196
07:28:48,390 --> 07:28:48,890
Wait.

7197
07:28:50,170 --> 07:28:50,950
Oh my god, look at it!

7198
07:28:51,130 --> 07:28:53,050
Look at young snake in the back!

7199
07:28:54,290 --> 07:28:55,910
Look at him, he's so baby!

7200
07:28:58,390 --> 07:28:58,990
Jabayden.

7201
07:28:59,970 --> 07:29:01,170
Jabayden, jabayden.

7202
07:29:01,610 --> 07:29:02,790
This baby!

7203
07:29:16,400 --> 07:29:16,880
Cool.

7204
07:29:18,560 --> 07:29:19,040
Welp.

7205
07:29:19,640 --> 07:29:22,560
Okay, I'm gonna turn off my GameCube now.

7206
07:29:24,860 --> 07:29:25,640
Actually, hold on, give me a second.

7207
07:29:25,880 --> 07:29:27,640
We're gonna move over to...

7208
07:29:27,640 --> 07:29:28,400
What the heck?

7209
07:29:29,600 --> 07:29:30,440
Oh, never mind.

7210
07:29:31,440 --> 07:29:32,240
Give me a second.

7211
07:29:33,880 --> 07:29:34,880
Here we go.

7212
07:29:35,120 --> 07:29:35,840
There we go.

7213
07:29:39,000 --> 07:29:40,440
Oh, and you can't hear anymore.

7214
07:29:41,320 --> 07:29:42,240
And off!

7215
07:29:43,080 --> 07:29:43,660
Here we go.

7216
07:29:43,820 --> 07:29:44,580
Turn it off.

7217
07:29:44,680 --> 07:29:45,420
Turn it off.

7218
07:29:47,940 --> 07:29:50,000
Let me put on some...

7219
07:29:50,000 --> 07:29:51,420
Oh, that's not what I wanted to do.

7220
07:29:51,720 --> 07:29:51,940
Oh, wait.

7221
07:29:52,180 --> 07:29:53,120
Did I mess it up?

7222
07:29:54,320 --> 07:29:56,120
It's mostly fine.

7223
07:29:57,800 --> 07:30:03,800
Sometimes if I put it on the wrong way, it sticks to my
bangs instead and it becomes weird.

7224
07:30:05,360 --> 07:30:05,720
The...

7225
07:30:05,720 --> 07:30:06,220
Oh, wait.

7226
07:30:06,300 --> 07:30:07,420
Stop it!

7227
07:30:11,260 --> 07:30:11,720
Do...

7228
07:30:11,720 --> 07:30:12,500
Do...

7229
07:30:12,500 --> 07:30:13,060
Do...

7230
07:30:15,600 --> 07:30:21,760
There was a Japanese collector's console bundle for this,
which comes with NES Metal Gear on a separate disc.

7231
07:30:22,340 --> 07:30:24,680
Oh, that's so awesome.

7232
07:30:26,360 --> 07:30:28,180
Let me get some music real quick, you guys.

7233
07:30:28,420 --> 07:30:29,200
Give me a second.

7234
07:30:30,320 --> 07:30:30,800
Beep.

7235
07:30:32,240 --> 07:30:33,420
Oh, bing.

7236
07:30:37,500 --> 07:30:37,960
Ah.

7237
07:30:41,780 --> 07:30:43,900
Wow, I feel so...

7238
07:30:44,860 --> 07:30:45,800
So good.

7239
07:30:47,520 --> 07:30:48,780
I feel so good.

7240
07:30:50,380 --> 07:30:51,580
That was so much fun.

7241
07:30:52,980 --> 07:30:58,820
Even if the bosses aren't like super difficult, still a lot
of fun.

7242
07:31:00,700 --> 07:31:04,480
It also makes you feel good when you're just like, yeah, I
can beat it easily.

7243
07:31:06,120 --> 07:31:08,840
Any chance of the Zone of the Enders playthrough at some
point boss?

7244
07:31:09,540 --> 07:31:15,660
It's a series near and dear to my heart for being my
introduction to Kojima-san.

I'm gonna disappear.

7262
07:33:11,630 --> 07:33:17,060
I think maybe my webcam is overheating.

7263
07:33:23,380 --> 07:33:23,780
Okay.

7264
07:33:25,160 --> 07:33:26,620
It might be overheating.

7265
07:33:28,920 --> 07:33:30,620
Oh, wait.

7266
07:33:30,740 --> 07:33:31,040
Hold on.

7267
07:33:40,840 --> 07:33:41,200
I'm here.

7268
07:33:42,300 --> 07:33:42,760
I'm here.

7269
07:33:42,920 --> 07:33:43,300
I'm a ghost.

7270
07:33:43,460 --> 07:33:45,600
I can just poof in and out of existence, you know?

7271
07:33:46,740 --> 07:33:49,040
I can poof in and out of existence.

7272
07:33:52,000 --> 07:33:58,240
I actually got really lucky with this because I was like,
you know, I was like, I'm going to come back.

7273
07:34:00,960 --> 07:34:12,360
but in the past i used my giant ipad and i was like i don't
really have room for my ipad on my desk i don't know what to

7274
07:34:12,360 --> 07:34:22,500
do and then my friend was just like well actually i have a i
have an iphone that i can sell to you thank you for the pipe

7275
07:34:22,500 --> 07:34:31,740
gift and thank you um and it's it's an older it's an older
iphone They bought it because they thought that, um, well,

7276
07:34:31,880 --> 07:34:32,640
not they thought it.

7277
07:34:32,700 --> 07:34:36,140
Well, yes, they, they thought that they had lost their
phone.

7278
07:34:37,120 --> 07:34:38,100
And so they bought it.

7279
07:34:38,740 --> 07:34:40,480
And then they ended up not needing it.

7280
07:34:41,380 --> 07:34:42,500
So, super duper lucky.

7281
07:34:44,980 --> 07:34:45,340
Yeah.

7282
07:34:48,640 --> 07:34:53,240
So, I was like, otherwise I would have had to probably buy,
like, a whole new phone.

7283
07:34:54,680 --> 07:34:55,680
How old is old?

7284
07:34:55,900 --> 07:34:58,040
This is a 10X.

7285
07:34:59,760 --> 07:35:13,570
I think it's the first phone that introduced like the the
the better stuff for V-tubing yeah it's the first one with

7286
07:35:13,570 --> 07:35:19,810
tracking yeah yeah yeah so it ended up working out really
well

7287
07:35:25,130 --> 07:35:34,030
yeah that's the iPhone X X 2017 isn't retro It's still new,
right?

iPhone only?

7291
07:35:58,810 --> 07:36:03,110
I think I don't know if maybe now more recent.

7292
07:36:05,630 --> 07:36:06,590
I don't know.

7293
07:36:08,170 --> 07:36:09,370
If more recent

7294
07:36:12,410 --> 07:36:13,890
Android phones can be used.

7295
07:36:14,910 --> 07:36:16,290
I'm not sure, to be honest.

7296
07:36:18,950 --> 07:36:20,490
This is all still new to me.

7297
07:36:22,050 --> 07:36:23,350
Paperbacks, thanks for the five gifted.

7298
07:36:23,650 --> 07:36:24,390
Thank you.

7299
07:36:24,470 --> 07:36:25,230
Okay, thank you.

7300
07:36:27,970 --> 07:36:30,230
Hey, boss.

7301
07:36:30,250 --> 07:36:31,950
I'm here to remind you to talk to your Kamiyoshi.

7302
07:36:32,430 --> 07:36:33,630
I have!

7303
07:36:35,750 --> 07:36:37,870
In fact, now.

7304
07:36:39,590 --> 07:36:40,690
I'm not gonna say.

7305
07:36:47,730 --> 07:36:48,930
I'm not gonna say.

7306
07:36:54,590 --> 07:37:03,050
But I saw, like, a clip where she was like, if Mint wants to
collab with me, she has to suffer.

7307
07:37:06,390 --> 07:37:07,350
What does that mean?

7308
07:37:09,590 --> 07:37:10,930
Oh, I saw that one.

7309
07:37:13,070 --> 07:37:14,070
Yes, sir.

7310
07:37:15,730 --> 07:37:16,770
Yes, sir.

7311
07:37:17,370 --> 07:37:18,490
What is that game?

7312
07:37:22,640 --> 07:37:23,620
What is that game?

7313
07:37:24,720 --> 07:37:25,420
And here's an S.

7314
07:37:26,820 --> 07:37:27,820
No, sir.

7315
07:37:30,360 --> 07:37:32,900
What's the first game?

7316
07:37:33,920 --> 07:37:34,640
What's it called?

7317
07:37:34,760 --> 07:37:35,460
Is it on Steam?

7318
07:37:36,740 --> 07:37:37,700
Well, I'm looking for it.

7319
07:37:40,880 --> 07:37:41,960
What's it called?

7320
07:37:43,340 --> 07:37:44,120
Sisyphus?

7321
07:37:44,340 --> 07:37:45,780
Oh, the game of Sisyphus?

7322
07:37:47,760 --> 07:37:50,360
Roll the boulder to the top.

7323
07:37:52,940 --> 07:37:53,880
Oh, this looks like...

7324
07:37:55,520 --> 07:37:57,360
Like, real kusage.

7325
07:37:59,690 --> 07:38:00,080
Oh.

7326
07:38:02,040 --> 07:38:03,400
Oh, oh.

7327
07:38:04,080 --> 07:38:05,020
Oh, no.

7328
07:38:06,260 --> 07:38:07,040
Um...

7329
07:38:07,880 --> 07:38:09,840
If I have to play it...

7330
07:38:14,040 --> 07:38:15,720
But, um...

7331
07:38:15,720 --> 07:38:23,360
To collab with her!

7332
07:38:31,560 --> 07:38:33,040
She's superficial.

7333
07:38:33,800 --> 07:38:34,660
Her words are very difficult.

7334
07:38:35,400 --> 07:38:35,860
It's very difficult.

7335
07:38:37,540 --> 07:38:37,840
Yeah.

7336
07:38:39,840 --> 07:38:40,820
She's selfish.

7337
07:38:41,060 --> 07:38:41,720
She's selfish.

7338
07:38:42,680 --> 07:38:45,400
Maybe she meant to say, Why are we still here?

7339
07:38:45,720 --> 07:38:46,500
Just to suffer.

7340
07:38:48,440 --> 07:38:50,040
You can do a mint, I believe in you.

7341
07:38:50,280 --> 07:38:51,060
Do it for her.

7342
07:38:51,480 --> 07:38:51,880
Why?

7343
07:38:52,760 --> 07:38:55,600
I guess I have to suffer for my kamiyoshi.

7344
07:38:56,600 --> 07:39:00,940
But it's okay if my kamiyoshi wants me to suffer, then I
don't mind it so much.

7345
07:39:01,260 --> 07:39:02,620
Make Kenya play Atlantis no Nazo.

7346
07:39:03,160 --> 07:39:05,640
We gotta play Atlantis no Nazo, you guys!

7347
07:39:06,160 --> 07:39:06,760
Well do we?

7348
07:39:07,780 --> 07:39:08,380
Do we actually?

7349
07:39:10,000 --> 07:39:11,960
I say that but now I'm like, wait a minute.

7350
07:39:12,720 --> 07:39:14,040
Do I actually have to play that?

7351
07:39:14,460 --> 07:39:15,120
Hmm.

7352
07:39:17,420 --> 07:39:18,060
Hmm.

7353
07:39:23,100 --> 07:39:23,260
Hmm.

7354
07:39:28,140 --> 07:39:28,980
Do you want to?

7355
07:39:29,300 --> 07:39:31,060
Yeah, I do want to play it, actually.

7356
07:39:31,840 --> 07:39:36,620
I think it's fun to also play games like that.

7357
07:39:36,800 --> 07:39:37,660
It's a challenge.

7358
07:39:37,820 --> 07:39:38,420
It's a challenge.

7359
07:39:39,000 --> 07:39:43,440
I'll increase my gamer, my gamer skills.

7360
07:39:44,540 --> 07:39:45,580
Thank you!

7361
07:39:47,640 --> 07:39:49,840
Space ghost, coast to coast.

7362
07:39:50,420 --> 07:39:51,180
Congrats on beating the game!

7363
07:39:51,420 --> 07:39:54,920
I really love how over the top all the animations were in
this one.

7364
07:39:55,100 --> 07:39:58,580
I was dying over Snake dodging the bullets while in the car
chase.

7365
07:39:59,040 --> 07:40:01,140
I know it's so, there's so much going on.

7366
07:40:01,640 --> 07:40:02,120
Yes, Minto.

7367
07:40:02,960 --> 07:40:03,720
No Minto.

7368
07:40:04,620 --> 07:40:05,400
Yes, Minto.

7369
07:40:06,420 --> 07:40:08,620
Of course, Madame Ghost.

7370
07:40:09,000 --> 07:40:11,460
I am Dragon.

7371
07:40:11,540 --> 07:40:12,540

Marilyn, thank you.

7375
07:40:18,880 --> 07:40:21,280
I really like the OG better, but this is a really fun
alternative take.

7376
07:40:21,760 --> 07:40:22,560
Yeah, of course.

7377
07:40:22,800 --> 07:40:23,840
I agree.

7378
07:40:24,000 --> 07:40:24,900
I like the OG better.

7379
07:40:26,260 --> 07:40:29,680
But this one is also so silly, goofy, fun.

7380
07:40:30,440 --> 07:40:32,220
I think I just love every Metal Gear.

7381
07:40:33,520 --> 07:40:35,200
I think I just...

7382
07:40:35,200 --> 07:40:36,460
I can't...

7383
07:40:38,720 --> 07:40:39,600
I can't...

7384
07:40:40,640 --> 07:40:43,160
Just say that I like one more than the other.

7385
07:40:44,460 --> 07:40:49,100

But.

7393
07:41:28,720 --> 07:41:29,000
Hmm.

7394
07:41:30,400 --> 07:41:32,000
There's so many games I want to play.

7395
07:41:33,280 --> 07:41:33,440
So.

7396
07:41:33,860 --> 07:41:34,860
But we have time.

7397
07:41:35,680 --> 07:41:36,220
We have time.

7398
07:41:36,300 --> 07:41:36,920
No worries.

7399
07:41:37,720 --> 07:41:38,720
I don't want to.

7400
07:41:38,740 --> 07:41:40,260
I don't want to rush through everything.

7401
07:41:41,020 --> 07:41:41,840
So fast.

7402
07:41:42,060 --> 07:41:42,200
You know.

7403
07:41:43,080 --> 07:41:43,940

07:41:44,460 --> 07:41:46,700

07:41:51,640 --> 07:41:51,940
Parentheses.

7408
07:41:52,260 --> 07:41:53,100
Revolver isolate.

7409
07:41:53,480 --> 07:41:53,960
Parentheses.

7410
07:41:54,320 --> 07:41:55,020
Revolver isolate.

7411
07:41:55,740 --> 07:41:56,940
Make them kiss.

7412
07:42:00,320 --> 07:42:01,760
Play what you enjoy.

7413
07:42:02,380 --> 07:42:02,400
Yeah.

7414
07:42:03,660 --> 07:42:04,240
Yeah.

7415
07:42:05,600 --> 07:42:06,700
So far I am.

7416
07:42:07,360 --> 07:42:09,680
So far.

7417
07:42:09,820 --> 07:42:10,580
I mean.

7418
07:42:11,880 --> 07:42:12,620

7419
07:42:12,820 --> 07:42:12,960

It's like, whatever, like...

7422
07:42:20,320 --> 07:42:22,480
It's not like I'm having a blast or anything.

7423
07:42:22,620 --> 07:42:24,620
It's not like I'm having the time of my afterlife or
anything.

7424
07:42:24,840 --> 07:42:25,460
It's just like, you know.

7425
07:42:38,360 --> 07:42:39,500
Revolver patch is on.

7426
07:42:48,770 --> 07:42:50,690
My time of my afterlife.

07:42:54,170 --> 07:42:54,570

7428
07:42:54,570 --> 07:42:56,290

7432
07:43:22,510 --> 07:43:22,870
Maybe.

7433
07:43:26,800 --> 07:43:27,160
Maybe.

7434
07:43:30,640 --> 07:43:31,160
It's...

7435
07:43:31,160 --> 07:43:33,280
I don't think I ever actually played...

7436
07:43:33,280 --> 07:43:34,620
Oh, sorry.

7437
07:43:34,800 --> 07:43:37,560
I don't think I actually played Heart Gold or Soul Silver.

7438
07:43:40,620 --> 07:43:41,260
Say that.

7439
07:43:44,640 --> 07:43:45,380
Say that.

7440
07:43:45,780 --> 07:43:49,980
Oh, I've never played...

7441
07:43:49,980 --> 07:43:52,560
I've played Original Golden Silver, but I've never played
the Remix.

7442
07:43:55,460 --> 07:43:56,240
I don't...

7443
07:43:56,240 --> 07:43:56,780
I actually don't...

7444
07:43:56,800 --> 07:43:58,200
So I don't own them either.

7445
07:43:59,760 --> 07:44:01,180
Pokemon games sell...

7446
07:44:01,180 --> 07:44:02,360
They're so expensive.

7447
07:44:02,480 --> 07:44:03,480
Even secondhand.

7448
07:44:04,040 --> 07:44:04,540
Like, let's see.

7449
07:44:04,600 --> 07:44:04,860
Hold on.

7450
07:44:04,980 --> 07:44:05,800

What's it for?

7454
07:44:11,460 --> 07:44:12,540
Oh, it's a DS game.

7455
07:44:12,640 --> 07:44:13,620
So I can play it on my 3DS.

7456
07:44:14,320 --> 07:44:14,920
Oh, wait.

7457
07:44:14,960 --> 07:44:15,620
This isn't so bad.

7458
07:44:15,720 --> 07:44:16,380
It's 40.

7459
07:44:18,220 --> 07:44:19,800
It's 40 without the case.

7460
07:44:20,580 --> 07:44:21,580
I don't need the case.

7461
07:44:23,140 --> 07:44:23,640
Let's see.

7462
07:44:23,660 --> 07:44:24,240
Soul silver.

7463
07:44:24,360 --> 07:44:25,400
I always get Soul silver.

7464
07:44:25,440 --> 07:44:26,780
Or I played silver before.

7465
07:44:26,800 --> 07:44:27,800

7466
07:44:30,520 --> 07:44:31,200

7531
07:48:34,060 --> 07:48:34,900
Mario Sunshine!

7532
07:48:36,400 --> 07:48:40,460
I've still been playing Korone, the wow, wow, wow, Korone
box.

7533
07:48:43,120 --> 07:48:45,240
Leave them in the comments though.

7534
07:48:45,860 --> 07:48:49,060
Like, uh, OG Resident Evil 4 is for the GameCube.

7535
07:48:49,240 --> 07:48:49,720
Oh, really?

7536
07:48:52,580 --> 07:48:56,260
But, um, yeah, leave it in the comments because if you put
it here, I'll forget.

7537
07:48:57,480 --> 07:48:59,180
So once the VOD is up.

7538
07:49:00,160 --> 07:49:03,020
Comment, like, for engagement.

7539
07:49:05,780 --> 07:49:08,540
That way I can go back through and see.

7540
07:49:13,760 --> 07:49:16,380
I realize I have not had dinner.

7541
07:49:17,640 --> 07:49:18,860
And it's almost 11 p.m.

7542
07:49:19,520 --> 07:49:22,460
And as much as I want to keep talking with you guys.

7543
07:49:23,900 --> 07:49:26,860
I'm starting to feel my head get foggy.

7544
07:49:28,480 --> 07:49:33,180
All I had was some twin snake Haribo gummies.

7545
07:49:34,060 --> 07:49:36,140
Which I was going to make this into my thumbnail.

7546
07:49:36,240 --> 07:49:37,520
I was going to print out a picture.

7547
07:49:38,100 --> 07:49:39,140
And take a picture of.

7548
07:49:40,100 --> 07:49:41,860
I was going to print out like a fan art.

7549
07:49:42,920 --> 07:49:43,180
And.

7550
07:49:43,320 --> 07:49:44,720
And cut it out.

7551
07:49:45,040 --> 07:49:45,320
And.

7552
07:49:46,640 --> 07:49:48,960
And paste it onto the.

7553
07:49:49,220 --> 07:49:49,900
Twin snakes.

7554
07:49:50,500 --> 07:49:50,940
Packaging.

7555
07:49:51,100 --> 07:49:51,660
And take a picture.

7556
07:49:51,740 --> 07:49:52,800
And use that as my thumbnail.

7557
07:49:53,180 --> 07:49:53,700
But then.

7558
07:49:53,780 --> 07:49:54,960
I saw the.

7559
07:49:55,080 --> 07:49:56,360
The thumbnail art.

7560
07:49:56,420 --> 07:49:56,860
And I was like.

7561
07:49:56,900 --> 07:49:58,140
