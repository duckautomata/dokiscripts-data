masochist.

You're a true gamer.

I trained that.

128
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,500
Oh, wow.

Woohoo!

133
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,400
So, I, who, I, I'm scared of the mods we have in here.

134
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,160
I don't know what everything we've got.

135
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,300
Oh, this is scary.

136
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,060
We need her.

137
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,840
Oh, you.

138
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,920
There's also a big game update that I don't know anything
about.

139
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,820
Yeah, the game was just updated.

140
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,740
It's kind of crazy.

141
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,240
Yeah, actually some mods broke from it.

142
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,600
I know.

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,480
Later, ConK.

144
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,100
We were gonna try and have a...

145
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,120
Maybe Tord a harder mode.

146
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,100
Yeah.

147
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,860
We were gonna do a Minecraft mod, but it doesn't work.

148
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,720
Yeah, the Minecraft world.

149
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,140
Yeah.

150
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,720
So sad.

151
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:08,960
It's okay, though.

152
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,200
Yeah, new monsters, I think.

153
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,520
So I don't know anything about the new monsters, but that's
okay.

154
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm scared, guys.

155
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,680
How do I- How do I- How do I sleep?

156
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,680
I shouldn't be on the computer.

157
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,720
I don't know what I'm doing.

158
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,860
I don't know what I'm doing either, but- What moon do you
want to go to?

159
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,840
Anything!

160
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,200
The first one!

161
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,100
Yeah, maybe the first one.

162
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:38,860
Experimentation?

163
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,260
I don't know.

164
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,680
I think that's the first one.

165
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,660
First one!

166
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,040
Okay.

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah.

Do you know what, like, we're doing?

171
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,280
Yeah, yeah, I have an idea.

172
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:50,840
Okay, okay.

173
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,320
I equip myself with basic knowledge.

174
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,720

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,440
I watched it too!

194
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,460
Wait, you guys are probably...

195
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,980
I watched monster deep dive video, like, I don't know,
explaining AI.

196
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:42,980
Yeah!

197
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,060
You're probably more professional than me.

198
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:46,900
I don't know!

199
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,420
I know it in theory.

200
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,440
I don't know how it works in practice.

201
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,100
Weird.

202
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,520
Well, we might have some gunk mechanics too, so I wouldn't
worry about the two mods.

203
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,020
Oh, really?

204
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,680
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

205
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,860
There's like one mod.

206
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:04,600
Yeah.

207
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,780
Yeah, the present.

208
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,060
Oh, the present, that's right.

209
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,100
Gotcha, Laka.

210
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,080
You guys ready?

211
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,260
Naki, you take care of it.

212
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,660
Push the lever.

213
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,540
Let's go!

214
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,100
He's ready?

215
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,560
He wants to pull the lever.

216
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,120
Naki, you want to pull it?

217
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,020
Pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it.

218
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,420
Can't even, why can't I even touch your pressure?

219
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,200
Let's go.

220
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,420
Oh, actually, I don't know if we can pull it.

221
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,060
I can't.

222
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,680
Oh, really?

223
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,060
Oh, yeah, there's no option.

224
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,540
My bad.

225
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,740
Maybe it's just you, Emily.

226
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,360
I think it has to be me.

227
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,520
I need the trigger.

228
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:41,780
Whoopsie.

229
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,120
Whoopsie.

230
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,120
Then everything breaks.

231
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:46,840
Yeah.

232
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,260
Whoopsie.

233
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:47,580
Oh.

234
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:47,620
Then everything breaks.

235
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,120
Oh, what's going on?

236
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,660
There we go.

237
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:51,880
Oh!

238
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:52,820
Oh!

239
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,440
Oh!

240
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,660
Oh!

241
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:02,440
Oh!

242
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:02,620
Oh!

243
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:04,720
Oh!

244
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,760
Oh!

245
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,640
Oh!

246
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,140
Oh!

247
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:17,960
Oh!

248
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,300
Oh!

249
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:18,340
Oh!

250
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,140
Oh!

251
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,480
Oh, yeah, you're supposed to scan things.

252
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,560
If you're close to it.

253
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,980
Hey, guys.

254
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,400
Oh!

255
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,980
You also showed me where the ship is.

256
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
In case you want to come back.

257
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,660
Yeah, in case I get lost.

258
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,600
Yeah.

259
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,720
Up here, up here, up here.

260
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,740
All right.

261
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,000
Here we go.

262
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,000
Dude, they're so fast.

263
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,300
Wow.

264
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,280
Here we go.

265
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,020
Oh.

266
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, it's gone.

267
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,510
It's gone.

268
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:51,450
It's gone.

269
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,710
Wait, not even going though.

270
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,550
Wait, I got some more.

271
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,210
Wait, wait, wait, where'd you guys go?

272
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,990
Where are they?

273
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,560
It's a seal.

274
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,080
It'll come down from the ceiling.

275
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,940
It's far away from us anyway.

276
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:26,300
Oh my god.

277
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,620
Okay.

278
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,420
Are you sure?

279
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:29,960
Are you sure?

280
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,400
It won't hit us, yeah.

281
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,760
It's far away.

282
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,700
I don't know about...

283
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,020
Naki.

284
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,240
Naki.

285
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,840
Oh my god.

286
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,780
I love you said it was far away.

287
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,240
We gotta go back!

288
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,300
We gotta go back!

289
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,340
I have her body!

290
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,700
I have her body!

291
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,740
Do we have anything?

292
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,420
We don't have anything.

293
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,300
We don't have...

294
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,360
Have her...

295
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,560
Ah!

296
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,640
Naki died too!

297
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,420
You have to get her body!

298
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,720
You have to get her body!

299
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,740
Okay, um, hold on.

300
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,460
How do I pick it up?

301
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,420
How do I pick it up?

302
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,880
E!

303
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,280
E!

304
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:12,940
E!

305
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,260
Press E!

306
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:13,960
Press E!

307
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,620
Yeah!

308
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm

309
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,300
trucking you up, Naki!

310
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,180
I'm sorry!

311
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,300
No!

312
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

313
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,720
Wait, wait!

314
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,760
I'll come over there!

315
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,380
We gotta put back Tori's body first!

316
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, yeah.

317
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,520
Oh, I can grab her body.

318
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,560
Can I try and get Naki's and I take Emory?

319
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,500
Alright, sure, sure.

320
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,660
How do I drop a body?

321
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,340
Okay, I got her.

322
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,620
I can't wait for me here.

323
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,080
Okay.

324
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,220
It's fine.

325
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,660
She knows the way back.

326
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,300
Emory, what happened?

327
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,300
Emory.

328
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,300
Emory.

329
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,300
One second guys.

330
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,370
Would have been better if I died first.

331
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,970
What?

332
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,690
What do you mean?

333
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,530
I couldn't get her body.

334
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,830
Wait, I wonder what's wrong.

335
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,030
Maybe it's kind of bugged.

336
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:36,510
Yeah.

337
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,010
It's okay.

338
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,410
Let's just go grab a couple things and then we can leave.

339
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:40,530
Okay.

340
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,030
Okay.

341
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,110
Don't die.

342
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,850
Don't die.

343
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:43,570
We got this.

344
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,030
We'll go the other way.

345
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,230
We'll go the other way.

346
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,510
The other way, alright.

347
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:47,910
Yeah.

348
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,370
Okay, here we go.

349
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,630
Okay, this way?

350
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,550
Wait, who is this?

351
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,450
Wait, who's this?

352
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,390
Wait, no, there's Sheba, wait, you left your body!

353
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,970
No, no, I took her to the Sheba!

354
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,510
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

355
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,370
We can get...

356
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,130
We gotta do bodies?

357
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,250
Um...

358
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,110
Oh my god.

359
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,870
What, what are we gonna do with this?

360
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,730
I don't know.

361
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,790
Wait, why do we have two of them?

362
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,950
Infinite money hack, maybe?

363
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,030
Here, I'm gonna...

364
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,530
Let's go check over here real quick and I'll see if there's
any items.

365
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,170
Alright, I'm ready.

366
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,250
Stay there.

367
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,190
Where are you?

368
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,950
Oh, there's nothing here.

369
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,910
It's empty completely.

370
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,750
Nothing you can grab?

371
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,030
Nope.

372
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,330
No.

373
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,050
They always just keep clicking right click and...

374
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,750
Oh, yeah.

375
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,770
Body of Emory.

376
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,070
Oh, what?

377
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,770
Wait, why is it red?

378
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,490
Oh, yeah, wasn't her thing?

379
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,310
Oh, it's green.

380
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,310
I'm like, still the same.

381
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,450
Oh, hmm.

382
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,330
The trap is over here.

383
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,050
Oh, here, here's a...

384
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,970
I got a thingy.

385
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,370
Oh, we're good.

386
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,190
We gotta follow you.

387
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,570
Okay, grab Emory.

388
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,790
Yeah.

389
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,470
Oh, Emory.

390
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,610
Let's grab her.

391
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,020
There we go.

392
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,740
Time to go back.

393
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,340
We got one thing so far.

394
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,640
Oh, we got two things.

395
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,680
We got an extra body.

396
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,220
We got an extra body.

397
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,040
You know, I wonder if we go back if she'll still be there
again.

398
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,960
Oh, right, right.

399
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,600
We got a chat.

400
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,140
Run, run, run, run.

401
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,020
Unlimited Emody works.

402
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:31,620
Oh!

403
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,780
Where did you place her body?

404
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:34,920
In here!

405
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,440
What?

406
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,380
I'm not crazy, you guys.

407
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,780
I'm not crazy, you guys.

408
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,340
I'm not crazy.

409
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,680
Are you sure you got her body the first time?

410
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,220
I was holding her the whole time.

411
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,740
Ayla, I was holding her the whole time.

412
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,600
I promise.

413
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,740
I promise.

414
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,460
It was in my head.

415
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,300
My chat.

416
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,120
My chat.

417
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,800
Chat, we saw.

418
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,860
It's okay.

419
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,000
It wasn't your fault.

420
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,860
Ayla, no.

421
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,600
No, you believe me, right?

422
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,440
Yeah, yeah.

423
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,440
She was right here.

424
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:08,860
Come on.

425
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,620
Wait, also, I wonder...

426
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,520
This didn't...

427
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,440
This isn't picking up that I grabbed it.

428
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:16,940
Ding!

429
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:18,880
Oh!

430
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,580
Maybe it's because of the mod?

431
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,440
Maybe.

432
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,100
Um.

433
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,580
Should we just go?

434
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,580
It's almost five.

435
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:28,540
Oh.

436
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,380
Okay.

437
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,520
You want to try one more thing.

438
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,020
Try and get a little bit more stuff.

439
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,380
Alright.

440
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,240
I got one more.

441
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,260
More stuff?

442
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:42,940
Yeah.

443
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,320
Okay.

444
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,160
I think we need the money.

445
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,920
We're gonna have to run.

446
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:45,860
Let's go.

447
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,420
Alright.

448
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,940
We might all die.

449
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,880
Oh, no, no, no.

450
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,720
I'm going to be the first one for sure.

451
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,800
It's going to go back.

452
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,320
Yeah?

453
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah.

454
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,520
Okay.

455
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,600
Oh, wait.

456
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,880
It says near activity detected.

457
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,300
I think there's a monster right there.

458
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,340
I'll check.

459
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:07,880
Oh.

460
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,420
I don't remember this song.

461
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,620
What just happened?

462
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,180
I don't think she should...

463
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,390
Oopsie!

464
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,610
It was camping!

465
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,810
It was camping!

466
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,630
That's so unfair.

467
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,250
Oh my gosh, unfortunate.

468
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,650
Unfortunate!

469
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,830

We're fine.

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,510
The quota is only like $100.

473
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,750
Yeah, it's okay, we got this.

474

Yeah.

Let's go.

492
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,650
Oh, how fast everyone died.

493
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,810
The minion greedy.

494
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,170
The minion greedy.

495
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,450
Okay, we could do assurance.

496
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,150
Maybe.

497
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:48,790
Assurance.

498
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:49,890
Is that the second map?

499
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:50,930
Yeah.

500
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:51,990
Let's try it.

501
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,150
Let's try it.

502
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,850
Okay.

503
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:56,630
Yeah.

504
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,390
Here we go.

505
00:20:59,450 --> 00:20:59,990
Woohoo!

506
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:01,690
Woohoo!

507
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,530
Let's go.

508
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,390
Okay, at least we got white before we got like a bunch of
loot.

509
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,070
Sneak.

510
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,630
I don't know where I'm stacking them.

511
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,350
I'm gonna rack in the money.

512
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,570
What if it's this mod breaking the game?

513
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:20,950
No way.

514
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,030
Oh yeah, I forgot to pass this.

515
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,170
Uh, worse, I think.

516
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,870
Here we go, Iquzo!

517
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:31,850
Iquzo!

518
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,650
Oh, oh, I love when they walk in place.

519
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,510
All right.

520
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,410
Everyone here?

521
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,150
Yeah!

522
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,070
Okay.

523
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,510
Iquzo!

524
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:47,910
Iquzo!

525
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,110
Wait, I don't remember how to get to the...

526
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,030
What's the entrance?

527
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,730
I think it's...

528
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,830
I think it's this way.

529
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,330
Okay.

530
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,810
Follow Emily.

531
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,470
Oh wait, I think you're right.

532
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,750
Oh, no, I don't know.

533
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,670
This way.

534
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,150
I don't know.

535
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:06,590
What was that?

536
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,510
What was that?

537
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,750
It was a...

538
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,590
You creature.

539
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:11,490
Ah!

540
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:11,950
Ah!

541
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:12,310
Ah!

542
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:12,690
Ah!

543
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,290
What is that?

544
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,760
It's a snake.

545
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,140
I think he likes you.

546
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,040
Yeah.

547
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,620
I think he likes you.

548
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,040
Yeah, you can join it.

549
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,780
Wow!

550
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,500
It's so cute!

551
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,700
It's kind of fashionable.

552
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,880
Wait, is he loving your eyesight or?

553
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,720
Um, sometimes.

554
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,620
Sometimes.

555
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:44,940
Sometimes.

556
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,800
Friend?

557
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,640
Okay.

558
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,560
It's okay.

559
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,300
He's my friend now.

560
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,920
I think it's a friend.

561
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:50,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

562
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,060
As long as he's not killing you.

563
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,360
Yeah.

564
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,300
I'm gonna name him Henry.

565
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,660
Oh!

566
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,180
Henry!

567
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:12,610
Oh!

568
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,210
It's on me.

569
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:13,970
Oh, there's a beehive.

570
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,070
Oh, no, there's so many Henrys.

571
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:16,490
Oh my god.

572
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,530
Oh my god, they're called Henry?

573

You should join us.

581
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,930
Wait, I think I'm flying.

582
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,990
Guys, drive away!

583
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,830
Guys, I think I need help.

584
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,350
I think I need help.

585
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,450
Wait, you have two.

586
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,550

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,630
Luigi, come home!

593
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,970
This is so fun.

00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,670
Wait, how do we get inside?

595
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,510
Is it this way?

596
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,970
I think it's this way.

597
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,190
If I could actually control, you know?

598
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:00,910
This way?

00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:01,210

Oh, I think this way.

606
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,090

608
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,230

611
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:19,590
Here it is!

612
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:19,970
Yay!

613
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,670
I don't know what I'm doing either, but...

614
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,670
Will he come inside with me or...

615
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:27,910
I don't know.

616
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,470
Let's test it.

617
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,030
Will he?

618
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,710
Oh.

619
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,170
Is he inside?

620
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,670
Oh, he's inside with me!

621
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,810
Yeah, he is inside!

622
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:40,730
Oh.

Uh-oh.

699
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,500
It's 5 p.m.

700
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,280
I think that was a worm.

701
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,300
Wasn't that a worm?

702
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,540
Uh-oh.

703
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,740
Oh, I don't like worms.

704
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,240
Uh-oh.

705
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,460
Maybe not.

706
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,060
I...

707
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,020
Okay, a fly don't have anything.

708
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,160

Oh, okay, good, good, good, good.

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,880
Oh, oh, oh.

00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,520
She's alive!

713
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,300
I don't...

714
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,840
I can't find anything!

715
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,280
Bracken was keeping its mind and its eyes on me.

716
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,020
You had the Bracken?

717
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,460
Oh, the Freeland Blushy is so cute.

718
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,780
Isn't it cute?

719
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,340
We're collectible.

720
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,360
On the way back, I was trained by worms, yeah?

721
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,920
Be a worm for you, girl.

722
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,780
Yeah, I wanna go?

723
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:03,940
Yeah, we can go.

724
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,380
I think we've got a lot of loot.

725
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,220
All right, let's go.

726
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,920
Let's go before we die.

727
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,120
Oh, wait, I forgot to select her.

728
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,760
Yeah, maybe I did see this.

729
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,220
I thought it was active.

730
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,820
Or moon.

731
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,200
I was hearing you guys' voices in there.

732
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,520
You heard us, but we weren't in there?

733
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,700
Yeah!

734
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,680
That's so scary.

735
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,620
You're here, right?

736
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,280
I thought you came back.

737
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,100
But no.

738
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,340
That was probably the Bracken imitating you.

739
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,740
That's so scary!

740
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,940
Oh, was the skinwalker doing its thing?

741
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,540
Yeah, I think so.

742
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,300
Yeah, I think it's imitating your voice.

743
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,040
Ew!

744
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,040

757
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,160
Yeah.

758
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,940
He can buy cat food for him, right?

759
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,900
I'm not sure what cat food.

760
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,560
Oh yeah, you can.

761
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,520
You can.

762
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:40,600
You can.

763
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,900
We forgot about shopping.

764
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,340
We can buy like flashlights.

765
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,240
No, we don't need flash.

766
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,500
Oh, we don't have money yet though.

767
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,240
Yeah, I don't think we have money actually.

768
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,440
Oh yeah, we only have 20.

769
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,100
So we might be able to buy cat food.

770
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,700
Let me check.

771
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,860
Cat food 5.

772
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,960
Do we have 5?

773
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,100
Yeah, we have 20.

774
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,320
Buy cat food!

775
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,740
Try emoting with the cat.

776
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,740
Am I emoting?

777
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,520
No.

778
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:10,800
No.

779
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,500
It doesn't work, I think.

780
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,300
Oh.

781
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,220
Yay!

782
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,180
Yay!

783
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,700
It's working!

784
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,200
It's working!

785
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,840
My son ever again!

786
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,340
Wait, what am I doing the crazy?

787
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,380
Yay!

788
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,880
Oh, come here.

789
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:35,660
Oh.

790
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,520
Here, we'll get you there.

791
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,720
We can put it on the table!

792
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,840
Look, we may be broke, but we need cat food.

793
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,780
Did you buy it?

794
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,680
Yeah, I did.

795
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,680
How much was it?

796
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,960
Um, it was five.

797
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,360
Okay, so let's land and then we can grab it.

798
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,180
I love it.

799
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,600
Kitty-gritty.

800
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,320
So good.

801
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:04,820
An ice cream machine.

802
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:05,860
Miu.

803
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,460

804
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,180

805
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,520
Oh.

806
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,480
Oh, the ice cream machine gonna land here.

807
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,780
I've never been here before.

808
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,880
Oh, is this new?

809
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,400
I think this is a new one.

810
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:18,520
Hmm.

811
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,340

It's just in the air

818
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,160
Watch out for the lake Oh, there it is.

819
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,060
Oh, I hear it!

820
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,980

00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,180
Where?

822
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,060

835
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:18,850
way.

836
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,210
This way.

837
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:19,610
This way.

838
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:20,830
Yeah.

839
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,530
Come around.

840
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:24,990
Alright.

841
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,790
Gather round.

842
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,030

Wow, this looks very annoying.

847
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,190
Yeah, he's like, why are you trying to force me to eat?

848
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,050
This isn't even my favorite flavor.

849
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:09,530
Eat!

850
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,590
Oh, oh, oh.

00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,130
I think the audio just like...

852
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,630
It did for me too.

853
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,970
Maybe it'll be gone.

854
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:18,990
Maybe he's shy.

855
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,130
It'll be gone when we get back.

856
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,670
Maybe he needs like... Yeah, yeah.

857
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,770
Yeah, yeah.

858
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,970
Yeah, yeah.

859
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,010
Keep him alone.

860
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:26,650
Alright.

861
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:27,810
Let's go!

862
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:47,230
I think I heard it crack a little you I think it's gonna
fall it looks a little unstable just like me all right you

863
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:59,510
go one at a time okay next person next next next come on
over come on over I think he can run.

864
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,630
It should be fine.

865
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,390
Yeah, it looks a little unstable.

866
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,290
I think it's okay though.

867
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:04,770
Yeah.

868
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,570
There should be an alternative way, though.

869
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,410
There's kind of...

870
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,010
Yeah, there has to be somewhere, right?

871
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:09,630
Yeah.

872
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,650
Okay, I think we can stop.

873
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:12,790
Loot,

874
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,050
loot, loot, loot.

875
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:20,290
Whoa.

876
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,650
We gotta keep the free Randall.

877
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,530
Oh, egg beater.

878
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:26,910
Egg beater.

879
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,870
Egg beater.

880
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,150
Um, um, um, yes.

881
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:31,570
Oh.

882
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,410
Oh, um, oh, what?

883
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,570
I think that's a thumbs up.

884
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,350
I think it was where we were at.

885
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,590
Let's go the other way.

886
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,070
Yeah, I think we should not go that way.

887
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,750
Um, um, why is it getting down there?

888
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,150
What?

889
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,590
Maybe it's on another floor.

890
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,730
I think we're okay.

891
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,750
Oh, weapon.

892
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,370
The stop sign.

893
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,290
No, I just have to go.

894
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,410
Are you guys alive?

895
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:02,990
Yeah?

896
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:03,930
Yeah?

897
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,550
Oh, it's just dying!

898
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,570
Oh my god!

899
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,610
Oh my god!

900
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,890
Oh, that almost scared me!

901
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,530
Oh, that's...

902
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,530
Oh, it's upside!

903
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,190
Nice!

904
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,670
Wait, we got it!

905
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,270
Let's go this way!

906
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:13,910
Let's go this way!

907
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,650
Okay, I think we'll be okay.

908
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:16,470
I don't have anything.

909
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,150
Yeah, yeah.

910
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:17,850
Yeah, let's...

911
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,650
I think we'll be fine.

912
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,810
I need to grab something.

913
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,790
Anything in here?

914
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,330
Hello?

915
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,370
I have empty hands.

916
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,750
It's pretty...

917
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:28,890
Oh!

918
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,470
I think I just saw the thumper go by.

919
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,110
Oh, yes, I just saw him.

920
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,170
I just saw him go.

921
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:34,790
Oh, my gosh.

922
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,090
So what?

923
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,030
Yeah, the thumper.

924
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:40,770
That monster?

925
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,630
Oh, my God.

926
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:42,970
Yeah, I think maybe.

927
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:43,770
I think so.

928
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,970
Maybe we should go.

929
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,310
Yeah, maybe we, yeah.

930
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,150
It's impressive.

931
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:50,690
Um.

932
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,350
Oh, what?

933
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,220
I think we can go.

934
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,320
Do you finally see the monster in there?

935
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,860
Yeah, we saw him around.

936
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,400
Yeah, yeah.

937
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,800
Yeah.

938
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,400
Maybe we can find the other entrance.

939
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,840
Maybe it's like down here.

940
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,600
That's another entrance?

941
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,140
There usually is.

942
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:18,440
Oh.

943
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,080
Fire exit?

944
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:19,940
That's...

945
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,320
Yeah.

946
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,620
Oh, watch out for the...

947
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,440
Is that the beehive?

948
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,100
Yeah, that's the actual beehive.

949
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,960
Watch out.

950
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,240
Beehive.

951
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,240
Oh.

952
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,420
Um...

953
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,780
Oh, there's another house here.

954
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,780
It's the house.

955
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,420
Oh, yeah.

956
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,360
Let's check that out.

957
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,220
Whoa.

958
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,100
Oh, it's lost.

959
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,940
Oh, I have a key.

960
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,300
Oh, try, try, try.

961
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:49,960
Nice.

962
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,160
Oh.

963
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,040
Oh, there's nothing here.

964
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,960
There's art.

965
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,360
It says something on the wall.

966
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,560
Sixier art.

967
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,280
A profound message.

968
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:05,960
I got it.

969
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,340
Art.

970
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,340
Sixier.

971
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,600
There is nothing here.

972
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,240
Heart.

973
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,360
What does that mean?

974
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,720
One away from greatness.

975
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:15,900
I know.

976
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:18,640
Hmm.

977
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,760
Are you going back or are you going back in?

978
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,760
Oh, what is that?

979
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,680
Is that a...

980
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,320
What is this?

981
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:25,680
What?

982
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,500
Oh, those guys are annoying.

983
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,420
Stay away.

984
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,900
Stay away.

985
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,040
Stay away.

986
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,780
Oh!

987
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,060
Oh!

988
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Oh!

989
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:40,920
Oh!

990
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,240
Oh!

991
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:41,680
Oh!

992
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,500
Oh!

993
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,940
I think they can't even come down.

994
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,520
It's probably...

995
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,240
Oh, I heard the cat.

996
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,280
Wait, did the cat come all the way over here?

997
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,420
I don't think so.

998
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,620
Maybe there's another cat.

999
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Maybe there's another cat.

1000
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,100
Oh.

1001
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,540
Uh... It's getting dark.

1002
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,100
It is starting to get dark.

1003
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,940
I don't know the way back, though.

1004
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,020
I think it's just up here, right?

1005
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,760
Yeah, there it is.

1006
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,420
Right there.

1007
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,720
Oh!

1008
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,380
Oh,

1009
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,660
how do I get up?

1010
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,380
Wait, how do we get up?

1011
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,760
How do I get up?

1012
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,020
I go under the bridge, yeah.

1013
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,220
Oh, go, go, go!

1014
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,420
I think you just gotta yell at them and they go away, right?

1015
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:36,860
Oh, really?

1016
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,060
I think so.

1017
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,360
They don't like noise, right?

1018
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,810
Wait, was someone alive?

1019
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,550
Was someone alive?

1020
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,030
Wait!

1021
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,630
We still have our cat!

1022
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,510
Oh no, they weren't allowed.

1023
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,210
Who was I hearing?

1024
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,650
Oh, Skinwalker maybe.

1025
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,230
Oh, maybe, yeah.

1026
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:54,830
Yay!

1027
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,490
I lost my son.

1028
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,990
Wait, Emily, are you talking?

1029
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,110
I can't hear you.

1030
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,010
Did you accidentally mute?

1031
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,010
I'm like...

1032
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,230
You had two days left to meet...

1033
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,550
We lost the cat, too.

1034
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,230
No, I can hear him, I can hear him.

1035
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,330
He's outside.

1036
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:16,970
Cat?

1037
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,210
He got killed?

1038
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,930
I feel like the cat could die.

1039
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:20,930
Maybe he's dead.

1040
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,010
Oh, hello?

1041
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,050
Oh, there you go!

1042
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:24,970
Hello?

1043
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:25,710
Hello?

1044
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,490
Okay, what did he do?

1045
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,450
Okay, my mic cut out for some reason.

1046
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:30,850
He should be good.

1047
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,470
Yeah, probably something bugged it.

1048
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,790
Do you know how we get to the company?

1049
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:36,930
Oh, let me see.

00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:48,950

Is it Gordy?

1057
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,610
Oh, this is where the company resides, yeah.

1058
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,270
I think we might have lost the cat.

1059
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:22,910
No!

1060
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,690
No, we didn't lose him!

1061
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,030
I promise he's right outside these doors!

1062
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:27,650
Cat!

1063
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,130
Really?

1064
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:29,630
Wait!

1065
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,570
Did they eat the food?

1066
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:32,650
Yeah.

1067
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:33,910
What's food?

1068
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,610
What the heck?

1069
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,170
Um...

1070
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:36,970
He's upstairs.

1071
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:37,690
He's up here.

1072
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,530
They must be really hungry.

1073
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:41,410
I...

1074
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,450
Oh, Tyler's not here.

1075
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:44,710
Everyone?

1076
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,870
Oh, I don't see Kenny.

1077
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:47,390
Everyone?

1078
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:48,010
What?

1079
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,350
I heard him!

1080
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,150
I heard him!

1081
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:50,390
See?

1082
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,630
I hear him!

1083
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,150
I hear him!

1084
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,970
Yeah, I... He's somewhere!

1085
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:54,650
I don't think he's delusional?

1086
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:55,110
What?

1087
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:55,910
See?

1088
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,770
You all need to... You need to take your meds too!

1089
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:00,230
It's not just me!

1090
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,230
It's you!

1091
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,070
Take your meds, everybody!

1092
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,370
He's in our wall.

1093
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:07,970
Oh, there he is!

1094
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:08,570
There he is!

1095
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,310
Where is he?

1096
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,030
Oh, gosh!

1097
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:12,670
Where?

1098
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,010
Is he inside the...

1099
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:14,530
I'm where?

1100
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:16,470
Um...

1101
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,450
Where is this pious peacock?

1102
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:19,730
Did he dip?

1103
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,310
What is his food?

1104
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,490
Is he invisible?

1105
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,110
It's empty.

1106
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,130
A scan.

1107
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:26,410
Oops.

1108
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:27,870
Where is he?

1109
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:28,610
It might be invisible.

1110
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:30,090
Hmm.

1111
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:31,630
Kenny?

1112
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,610
Where is he?

1113
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:35,010
Where is he?

1114
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,150
Where is he?

1115
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,680
I think we're going crazy.

1116
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,560
Are you under the ship?

1117
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,320
It's you, Emily.

00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,260

No, sorry guys, it was me.

I got a little hungry.

1125
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:21,880
It was very yummy!

1126
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,480
Why is he eating the food even?

1127
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,020
I don't know if I could sell it.

1128
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,980
Oh, can we sell it?

1129

Oh, they're the egg beater too.

00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:38,860
Ah!

1133
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,260
Sorry, I, uh...

1134
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,860
I scared myself.

1135
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,360
What did he say?

1136
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,580
He said you have been valuable to the company.

1137
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:53,940
Oh.

1138
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,180
Oh.

1139
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,120
I dare you.

1140
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,720
Why is he not getting the item?

1141
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,760
Oh my god.

1142
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,360
How did you live?

1143
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,840
How did you live?

1144
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,020
How someone lived?

1145
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,820
That spooked me earlier too.

1146
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:14,920
Cookie sheet?

1147
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:15,880
Oh, you're right!

1148
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,920
I know I have a cookie sheet.

1149
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:17,540
You're right.

1150
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,240
Thanks, guys.

1151
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,460
Oh, okay.

1152
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,280
How much did we get?

1153
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,860
Good eye.

1154
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:25,480
Did you reach the quota?

1155
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,020
Higher profit.

1156
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,120
Did you have to sell Freeman?

1157
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:29,980
We don't?

1158
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:30,760
We can keep Freeman.

1159
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:31,620
Yippee!

1160
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,460
We keep her.

1161
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,760
Yeah, we reach the quota though.

1162
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,200
Oh, yeah!

1163
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,280
Let's go!

1164
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,180
Good job!

1165
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,620
Just barely.

1166
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,620
Oh my god.

1167
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:41,600
Yay!

1168
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,440
First day at the company.

1169
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,000
Good job, everybody.

1170
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:49,840
Good job.

1171
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,180
Good job, everybody.

1172
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,060
Good job.

1173
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,180
Oh, oh, oh, he's good job.

1174
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,520
I don't know where our cat is, but he'll come home.

1175
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,860
I think the cat turned into a ghost.

1176
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,500
I think so too, honestly.

1177
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,000
Is that possible?

1178
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,100
You don't see him under here.

1179
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,800
Wait, wait, I heard him.

1180
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,820
I heard him just now.

1181
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,420
Oh, really?

1182
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:11,960
Over here.

1183
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:13,420
Cat.

1184
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,180
Oh, I see him!

1185
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,300
He's up here!

1186
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,860
He's coming!

1187
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1188
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,700
Watch!

1189
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:18,760
Look!

1190
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,300
He's coming!

1191
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,920
Oh my god!

1192
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,020
Can we get him?

1193
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:22,840
Wait, wait!

1194
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:23,800
I got him!

1195
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,720
I got him!

1196
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:24,960
Yay!

1197
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:26,620
Cat!

1198
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,380
Where are you?

1199
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,300
We saved him!

1200
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:35,800
Down!

1201
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,160
Oh my god.

1202
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,940
Aw, that's okay, Kat.

1203
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,400
Invisible tree.

1204
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,840
You're safe now.

1205
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,600
Okay, now, oh my gosh.

1206
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,800
Okay, now, oh my gosh, can you imagine if we left?

1207
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,020
He would have been stuck there.

1208
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,280
Yeah.

1209
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,700
That would have been so sad.

1210
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,680
Okay, good lady.

1211
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,000
Maybe we should put him inside here.

1212
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,240
Oh, true, true, true.

1213
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,120
Yeah, put him in there.

1214
00:46:59,580 --> 00:46:59,600
Nice.

1215
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,020
Oh, there, lock him in.

1216
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:01,480
Oh my God.

1217
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,200
Good, good, good.

1218
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,900
I think that works.

1219
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:05,800
Yeah, I think so.

1220
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,600
It worked, it worked.

1221
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:07,480
It worked.

1222
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,040
Just a grab.

1223
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:09,260
Okay.

1224
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,000
Put him in there.

1225
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:10,460
There we go.

1226
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,140
His butt is a bit down.

1227
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,060
This is humane.

1228
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:15,960
This is humane.

1229
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:16,580
Yeah.

1230
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,340
Just to keep him safe, you know?

1231
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,600
It is, it is, it is.

1232
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,260
I don't think the computer likes me.

1233
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:26,760
It opens.

1234
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,040
Do we have money?

1235
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:28,720
We have money!

1236
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,820
We can buy flashlights!

1237
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,500
I don't need flashlights!

1238
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,420
No flashlight?

1239
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,120
No!

1240
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,140
I don't need a flashlight.

1241
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,160
Okay, we're gonna put a name flashlight.

1242
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,940
I need this flashlight.

1243
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,440
I don't know.

1244
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,560
Oh, wait!

1245
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,660

I can't grab it.

1257
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:44,530
Shake it.

1258
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:45,210
And shake it off.

1259
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:47,910
Why can't I grab it?

1260
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,030
Oh, I think I need to crouch.

1261
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:50,370
Oh.

1262
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:52,050
There we go.

1263
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:52,770
Nice.

1264
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:54,010
Run out.

1265
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:54,970
Come here, Amori.

1266
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:55,490
Come here.

1267
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:56,510
Whoa.

1268
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,930
Are you drawing on me?

1269
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:00,890
It doesn't work.

1270
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:02,650
Are you run out of paint or no?

1271
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:03,770
I don't know, actually.

1272
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,260
I don't think you run out of it.

1273
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,400
I think the mod left you.

1274
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,080
Ooh, they are different color.

1275
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,880
Oh, if you press T, you can change color.

1276
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:13,700
Oh.

1277
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:15,720
Yeah.

1278
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,480
And you can press E to erase, I think.

1279
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,100
E?

1280
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:19,420
E?

1281
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,540
Yeah, E to erase.

1282
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,560
You have to hold it, though.

1283
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,580
Oh, right.

1284
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:23,840
E for erase.

1285
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,880
This is the most massive.

1286
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,100
It's so damn!

1287
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:28,980
It's so damn!

1288
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,160
Oh my gosh.

1289
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,780
We can...

1290
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,120
Oh, you could only fit Sam.

1291
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,760
I couldn't fit Samma.

1292
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,780
I could only fit Sam.

1293
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:41,600
I love Sam.

1294
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:42,760
I love Sam.

1295
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,800
I think you have to shake it too.

1296
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,220
Oh my gosh.

1297
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,340
That doesn't look like a dress.

1298
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,520
How do you change your color again?

1299
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,700
Oh, T.

1300
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,120

1301
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,080

Cute.

1323
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,080

Oh, yeah, school.

00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,280
Oh, look, yellow.

1329
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:27,820
Not good.

1330
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,480
I'm trying to draw like a cat.

1331
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,040
I don't think it's working.

1332
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,600
I think you have to shake it.

1333
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:36,620
Or you get closer.

1334
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,360

1345
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,180
Is this one having the same personality type does?

1346
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,640
I think so.

1347
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,350
Oh.

1348
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:41,710

Oh.

1352
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,610
Oh my god.

1353
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,690
How vulgar.

1354
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:53,470
Graffiti, graffiti, graffiti, graffiti.

1355
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:56,830
Oh man.

1356
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,050
I'm gonna make it worse.

1357
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:02,430
I wanted this to be fair to see.

1358
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,470
Yeah, will this still be here when we come back?

1359
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:08,130
Poopy, poopy.

Oh, poopy, poopy.

1361
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,770
Whoa, that might get you, it's spelled from school.

1362
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:16,990
I know, I hope so.

1363
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,310
Oh, actually, I know what else I can draw.

1364
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:21,890
She has so much power.

1365
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,110
I keep dropping my pen.

1366
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:28,090
Eyes, they're staring at you.

1367
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:30,150
Oh my gosh.

1368
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,850
What are you drawing?

1369
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:34,890
I drew a smiley face.

1370
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:40,810
He's wearing big glasses.

1371
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:43,650
He's a nerd.

1372
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:44,470
Nerd.

1373
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,550
This looks like a flower.

1374
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:50,590
What's that?

1375
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:51,150
That doesn't look right.

1376
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,510
I'm going to erase it.

1377
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:54,090
Wow.

1378
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:57,850
Cute.

1379
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,430
Oh, it's so cute.

1380
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:02,210
Let's go to the pee people.

1381
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:05,870

1382
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:07,690

00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:08,250
Wow.

1384
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:10,770
He likes vandalism.

1385
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,450
You're like a prisoner.

1386
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,620
I can't breathe too short.

1387
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,440
This is real vandalism.

1388
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:31,960
Emory.

1389
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,560

00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,000
Uh oh.

1391
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,080
Oh, I can vandalize this card.

1392
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:44,840
Oh my god.

1393
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,800
Your office looks better now, I think.

1394
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,360
Vandalism, vandalism!

1395
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:56,580
No.

1396
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:57,820
Aww.

1397
00:54:59,060 --> 00:54:59,580
Can I

1398
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:07,820
ask?

1399
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,720
Someone wrote something so mean about you.

1400
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,100
For the company.

1401
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,940
I knew the nerd glasses.

1402
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,900
The nerd glasses actually.

1403
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:22,240
This is too long!

1404
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:26,780
Comple.

1405
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,380
Are you guys comfortable?

1406
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,380
Is our cat still in our locker?

1407
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,360
Yeah, I think the cat's meowing.

1408
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,100
Oh yeah, he's still in there.

1409
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:35,740
It's all good.

1410
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,440
Emu-y is a nerd.

1411
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,700
It's a compliment.

1412
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,180
He's bullying me.

1413
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,780
SpeedTubers are...

1414
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,620
Are?

1415
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,100

1416
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,200

Trill, trill, trill.

00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,420
VTubers are cringe.

1436
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,220
VTubers are criminals.

00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,600
Wow, this is so fun.

00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,480
He won't get me.

1444
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,040
He can't get me.

1445
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,220
I don't think.

1446
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,160
I could see.

1447
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,120

I made it two points.

01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:23,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it disappeared before my very eyes.

1504
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:28,040
Oh, I think the more you use the spray paint, it will
disappear.

1505
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,060
Oh, is that one?

1506
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,380
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1507
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,360
Oh, man.

1508
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,060
Wow.

1509
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,020
That's how it works.

1510
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,560
Oh, there it goes.

1511
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,980
It doesn't even say, nerd.

1512
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,260
It just says, erd.

1513
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,180
Erd.

1514
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,380
Erd.

1515
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,640
There we go.

1516
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,100
No.

1517
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:48,600
Ah!

1518
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:52,970
Nothing.

1519
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:54,810
Nierd!

1520
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:55,970
There we go.

1521
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:57,490
Oh, no, no, no!

1522
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,030
Nierd.

1523
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:03,670
All right.

1524
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:06,610
All right, okay.

1525
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:09,070
Okay, well, hopefully it's there when we come back.

1526
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,290
Yeah, we'll see you, I guess.

1527
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:12,050
All right.

1528
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:14,430
You guys ready for next mission?

1529
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:15,250
Yeah!

01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:17,650
You guys are so fun.

01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:19,930
She's so cute.

1532
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,870
She's so cute.

1533
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:23,950
Oh!

1534
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:24,930
Oh!

1535
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:30,070
How did it get so big?

1536
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:34,790
Oh my gosh, we could draw inside.

1537
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,180
This is interior decorating.

1538
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:42,710
For the company.

1539
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:45,030
For the company!

1540
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:46,090
We need some art.

1541
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:47,730
Our cat is green!

1542
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:50,110
oh really

1543
01:01:53,930 --> 01:02:00,860
there we go

1544
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,000
radioactive radioactive

1545
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:22,640
radioactive child yeah let's see this is all my safety
standards whoa oh my gosh I'm so like colorful it looks like

1546
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,360
it looks like holographic should we light It's true.

1547
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,240
Go to experimentation.

1548
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,400
Oh, what is there?

1549
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:37,280
There's experimentation, assurance, adamance, rend, dine.

1550
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,820
The rest are like flooded or rainy or foggy.

1551
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,060
Uh, okay.

1552
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,720
We could try experimentation again.

1553
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:45,900
Experimentation?

1554
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,660
Since we died last time.

1555
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,940
I don't think we've seen Goku yet, right?

1556
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,760
No, we haven't.

1557
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,000
No, Goku, yeah.

1558
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,900
Wait, oh, it must be...

1559
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,020
Oh, we have to leave.

1560
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:00,000
No, bracket, but it was not Goku.

1561
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:01,860
Goal is to meet Goku.

1562
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:07,440
Goku, Goku, Goku, Goku, Goku, Goku.

1563
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,580
Must manifest Goku.

1564
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,260
Oh my god, the cat is beautiful.

1565
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:10,880
Oh my god.

1566
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:12,980
It was beautiful.

1567
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,340
Now we can go, I think.

1568
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:20,000
Hi.

1569
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,680
Did we ever buy flashlights or...

1570
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,200
Oh, no.

1571
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:24,920
We spent...

1572
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:25,960
Yeah, you can.

1573
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,020
Yeah, we're all like, we don't need flashlight.

1574
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:29,940
I think I can just press serious.

1575
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:30,900
We don't need flashlight.

1576
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:32,800
Here we go!

1577
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,240
Let's go!

1578
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:38,960
I wanna hear Goku.

1579
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:40,120
I'm gonna, you know what?

1580
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,460
I'm gonna run around inside.

1581
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,040
I think the catch is very...

1582
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,380
Nothing will stop me.

1583
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:48,000
Nothing will stop me.

1584
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:48,780
Oh, shiny.

1585
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:49,760
All right.

1586
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:50,540
We land?

1587
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:51,280
We landing?

1588
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,900
Where are we landing, boys?

1589
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:53,500
Oh!

1590
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,020
What was that?

1591
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,900
Kiss, kiss, free Rin, good luck!

1592
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,120
Yeah, kiss free, free, good luck!

1593
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,540
For good luck, for good luck!

1594
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,700
Yeah, for good luck.

1595
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,380
Free Rin, some bless our, bless our journey.

1596
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:12,980
Um...

1597
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:14,720
Uh...

1598
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:15,720
Uh...

1599
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,080
Oh.

1600
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:17,360
Uh-oh.

1601
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,140
Uh, what?

1602
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:19,440
Uh...

1603
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:19,620
What?

1604
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:20,600
Yeah?

1605
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,380
Why is it eclipsed?

1606
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,440
An eclipse?

1607
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,760
Oh, I don't like that.

1608
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:25,100
Oh!

1609
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, close the door, close the door!

1610
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:33,400
I think he's coming closer.

1611
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,260
You're stuck.

1612
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,760
It didn't say Eclipsed?

1613
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:49,720
Yeah.

1614
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:51,880
I think we can go.

1615
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:52,920
He's on the back of the...

1616
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:53,620
He's on the back.

1617
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,420
I think we can go.

1618
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,720
We just gotta be quiet.

1619
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:56,300
Just be quiet.

1620
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:57,460
Yeah, just be quiet.

1621
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,860
He's expecting me.

1622
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:55,400
Is it not picking you up?

1623
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,320
It was cracking me up.

1624
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:03,960
Oh my god.

1625
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,840
Oh my god.

1626
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:09,600
Oh, what was that?

1627
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1628
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:11,820
What was that?

1629
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:13,420
I heard something.

1630
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:14,840
Oh, no.

1631
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,280
What was that?

1632
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:18,520
Oh.

1633
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,780
It's a little dark.

1634
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,240
Nothing there.

1635
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:36,740
Watch your step.

1636
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:37,700
Watch your step.

1637
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:38,600
Watch your step.

1638
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,460
Keep scanning.

1639
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:57,540
I don't see anything else.

1640
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:58,780
Me neither.

1641
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,800
I don't see a place to walk, so...

1642
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:02,820
I guess we go back.

1643
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,100
But the other way...

1644
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,680
Was that the Bracken in the beginning?

1645
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:09,140
Maybe.

1646
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:10,960
That sound that we heard?

1647
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,260
But the Bracken should say, hey, it's me, Goku.

1648
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,300
Oh, you're right.

1649
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,640
But I said Bracken.

1650
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,820
Hey, it's me, Goku.

1651
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,640
Hey, it's me, Goku.

1652
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:20,520
Hey, it's me, Goku.

1653
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:24,100
It's me, Goku.

1654
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:24,780
There's nothing.

1655
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:27,920
Oh, there's a flask.

1656
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:29,020
Oh, opening...

1657
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:30,540
Grab the flask.

1658
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:31,440
Grab it.

1659
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,140
Ooh, can you drink it?

1660
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:34,240
Sound kind of wet.

1661
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,100
Oh, nice.

1662
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:35,640
Nope.

1663
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:36,140
Oh.

1664
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,620
The door sounds scary.

1665
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,100
The door is so scary.

1666
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:44,220
Calm.

1667
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:45,500
Okay.

1668
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,460
Oh, it's dead end.

1669
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,280
There's not a lot here.

1670
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:49,540
Lala.

1671
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,180
Lala.

1672
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,260
I think we gotta go to the other side.

1673
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:57,380
Yeah.

1674
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:58,380
The other side.

1675
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,200
This one is really big though.

1676
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:01,800

1689
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:55,560
Wait, what's supposed to happen?

1690
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,640
I don't know, actually.

1691
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:00,640
Goku.

1692
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,520
I think we're all good here.

1693
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,860
I think we're all good, yeah.

1694
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:11,950
I think we have one more item.

1695
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:12,690
Yeah, me too.

1696
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,130
I have enough for one more.

1697
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:16,270
Yeah.

1698
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:16,730
Oh.

1699
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:20,790
Okay, that's the exit right there.

1700
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:21,250
Uh-huh.

1701
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:22,290
Oh, there's...

1702
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:24,890
Oh, what's that?

1703
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:27,170
I think that was a Pacifica walker!

1704
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:31,630
I don't think that was a friend!

1705
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:36,110
I think it's close.

1706
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:39,690
I think it's close.

1707
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:40,150
Should we...

1708
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:41,370
Yeah.

1709
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:42,010
Yeah.

1710
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:42,410
Okay.

1711
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:43,850
This is the...

1712
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:44,030
Yeah.

1713
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,710
Okay, here we go.

1714
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,250
Remember the dogs.

1715
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:56,650
Dogs are bad.

1716
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:57,110
Yeah.

1717
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:58,230
In this game.

1718
01:09:58,910 --> 01:09:59,010
Oh.

1719
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,960
Where's the...

1720
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,540
We just so?

1721
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,040
Oh.

1722
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:07,920
Oh.

1723
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,260
Um, I think he's on the ship.

1724
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:13,420
Oh, yeah.

1725
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,460
There's a lot.

1726
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:15,780
There's two of them.

1727
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,940
There's two of them.

1728
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:19,520
They're on the ship.

1729
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:24,210
So, who are they attacking?

1730
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,600
Safe to.

1731
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,820
They're attacking someone.

1732
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,480
I think it's the cat.

1733
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,320
No.

1734
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,340
I think we can go now.

1735
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,460
Oh yeah.

1736
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,200
Wait, wait, wait.

1737
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,860
It sounded like you.

1738
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:53,900
It sounded...

1739
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:54,660
Really?

1740
01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:06,950
No!

1741
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:56,950
Why did it get me?

1742
01:11:57,170 --> 01:11:57,290
I

1743
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:03,730
gotta get...

1744
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:05,410
Oh my god!

1745
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:07,370
No!

1746
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,350
We lost everything!

1747
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:10,430
No!

1748
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:11,870
No!

1749
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:12,650
Oh, Freeran!

1750
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:15,890
Oh, Freeran!

1751
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:16,310
Oh, Freeran!

1752
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,440
I like had it and then they got me.

1753
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,280
Yeah, what the heck?

1754
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:26,320
So rude.

1755
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:30,960
I got the, it gave me like the Metal Gear like death scene
though.

1756
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:31,960
It did, it did.

1757
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:32,680
Okay.

1758
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:33,220
Really?

1759
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:33,840
Mm-hmm.

1760
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:37,160
Oh my gosh.

1761
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:37,600
Man.

1762
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,720
Yeah, everybody died the end.

1763
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,620
We didn't know that it was, it didn't say Eclipse though
when I picked it.

1764
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,500
It didn't change.

1765
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,960
Yeah, the odds were up also.

1766
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:50,460
I forgot to put my spray can here.

1767
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,400
I can't put show shine.

1768
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,360
You can have mine, it's okay.

1769
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,300
You can have mine.

1770
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,880
You can have mine too, yeah, yeah.

1771
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,020
It's okay, it's okay.

1772
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,580
Okay, now it says Eclipse.

1773
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:03,800
Wow.

1774
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:06,000
They lied to us.

1775
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:07,020
What is Vow?

1776
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:08,800
I've never... You gaslit us.

1777
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:11,960
Is Vow good to go to?

1778
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:13,860
a new one.

1779
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,020
Yeah, yeah.

1780
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:15,760
I'll try Vow.

1781
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,860
As long as it's not a cleric or a bad letter.

1782
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:19,660
Yeah.

1783
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,620
Oh, we don't have a lot of money left.

1784
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:23,380
Uh-oh.

1785
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:25,160
Uh-oh.

1786
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:25,840
We have a lot of money.

1787
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:28,080
We can get more money.

1788
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:28,680
Yeah.

1789
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:29,940
Yeah, we'll just get more money.

1790
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:30,840
Yeah.

1791
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,000
I'll just Vow.

1792
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,100
We lost our cat, Eva.

1793
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,320
This is so sad.

1794
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,480
I think there's a lot of cats, though.

1795
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,480
We can find another cat.

1796
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:39,920
Yeah.

1797
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,760
I found another liner.

1798
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:42,360
Yeah.

1799
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,580
Also killed us, though.

1800
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:45,900
We gotta be killed.

1801
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,160
I can see the dog charging us.

1802
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:49,380
Let's let...

1803
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:49,540
Oh.

1804
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,280
Land.

1805
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,520
Oh, Titan's good for beginner.

1806
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:56,320
It is?

1807
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,320
Titan is good.

1808
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:00,800
I think they're trolling.

1809
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:03,700
Yeah, I don't know about that.

1810
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:05,320
Yeah, you go moonwalking Luigi.

1811
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,600
You go moonwalking Luigi.

1812
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:09,020
Yeah.

1813
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:11,880
Moonwalk?

1814
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,200
Yeah, this is normal.

1815
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,600
This is normal.

1816
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:16,860
Titan easy?

1817
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,840
It should be safer.

1818
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,280
Titan's oddies.

1819
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:21,700
Wait, is it this way, right?

1820
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,340
This way?

1821
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,800
Is this a new map?

1822
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:28,340
This is fine.

1823
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:28,780
This one?

1824
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:30,140
This one?

1825
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,020
Yeah, I think this one's old.

1826
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,600
Don't follow me!

1827
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:36,920
I don't know where I'm lost!

1828
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:38,480
Clear!

1829
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,240
Oh wait!

1830
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,500
I don't know where I'm going!

1831
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:41,080
I found it!

1832
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,120
Oh, yeah!

1833
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,020
Okay, okay, okay.

1834
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,760
We have to walk across the bridge.

1835
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,680
Yeah, this one's the concrete one.

1836
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:51,540
Everybody can go.

1837
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:52,960
This is the concrete one, okay.

1838
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,100
Yeah.

1839
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:55,740
Yeah.

1840
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:59,220
Oh, it's not the back door.

1841
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:01,820
It's right here.

1842
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,060
Wait, where is it?

1843
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,380
Wait, wait a minute.

1844
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:06,520
Where's the door?

1845
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:08,020
Oh, it's right here, right here.

1846
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1847
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:10,440
But would I scan?

1848
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:11,600
It doesn't show up.

1849
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,200
Weird.

1850
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,120
Oh!

1851
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:13,740
Ducky!

1852
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,080
Ducky!

1853
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:17,240
Ducky!

1854
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:19,900
I'm done.

1855
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:20,920
Ducky, Ducky.

1856
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:25,000
I wonder what else there's around.

1857
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:25,720
Nothing here.

1858
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,720
Nothing here.

1859
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:31,180
Nothing here.

1860
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,480
Actually nothing here.

1861
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:37,420
Mito!

1862
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:38,540
Hi!

1863
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,400
Where are you?

1864
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,240
Where are you?

1865
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,480
There's nothing down there.

1866
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,120
Oh, oh my god.

1867
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:48,800
Oh my god.

1868
01:15:56,570 --> 01:15:57,470
Oh, it's the yippee!

1869
01:15:58,190 --> 01:15:58,750
Yippee!

1870
01:15:58,990 --> 01:15:58,990
Yippee!

1871
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:00,850
Yippee!

1872
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:05,250
Something attacked me?

1873
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:05,450
What?

1874
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:06,870
It's a yippee bug.

1875
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:08,970
Yeah, it's the yippee bug.

1876
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:10,230
Yippee!

1877
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:11,990
Yippee!

1878
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:12,910
Yippee!

1879
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:15,930
I love, I love a yippee bug.

1880
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:18,230
Actually, I hate the yippee bug.

1881
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:19,770
But I love the yippee.

1882
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:22,350
Oh, this is also dead end.

1883
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:23,650
Toilet?

1884
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:25,970
I was like, toilet!

1885
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:29,650
I was like, I don't remember putting in the Skippity Toilet
mod.

1886
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:32,030
I'm scared for a second.

1887
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:32,650
Whoa!

1888
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:34,430
Oh, I thought it was a toilet too!

1889
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:35,150
Yeah!

1890
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:36,530
Something's seaming.

1891
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:40,650
Yeah, we have to turn it off somewhere.

1892
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:41,870
Yeah, there should be a valve.

1893
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:42,690
Oh, is that it?

1894
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:43,290
No.

1895
01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:45,550
Find it?

1896
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:46,170
No.

1897
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:48,950
I can't find it.

1898
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:50,730
Hi!

1899
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:52,530
It's so dark!

1900
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:53,250
Where am I?

1901
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:54,790
It's his arm!

1902
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:55,430
Yippee!

1903
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:56,750
Oh jeez!

1904
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:57,630
It's really dark!

1905
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:58,590
Wait.

1906
01:16:59,250 --> 01:16:59,430
What?

1907
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:00,530
No yippee!

1908
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:01,530
Are they okay?

1909
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:02,710
I think we should go.

1910
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:03,810
I think we should go.

1911
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,710
Oh my god.

1912
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:05,390
No yippee!

1913
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:06,130
No yippee!

1914
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:08,110
I

1915
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:22,170
found its nest.

1916
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:26,910
He won't know that I'm holding onto that right?

1917
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:29,810
Where are you?

1918
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:30,550
Oh!

1919
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:31,590
Out!

1920
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:32,890
Out.

1921
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:33,090
Out.

1922
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,470
Oh, where am I?

1923
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:37,190
Okay, you can have it!

1924
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:39,110
You can have it!

1925
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:45,150
Hello?

1926
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:47,670
Uh...

1927
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:51,410
I think that's a...

1928
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:52,650
I think that's a...

1929
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:53,830
That's a skinwalker.

1930
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,110
That's gotta be a skinwalker.

1931
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:55,490
Okay.

1932
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:57,310
Oh.

1933
01:17:59,310 --> 01:17:59,870
Yeah.

1934
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:01,070
Wait, no.

1935
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:03,170
Where is this?

1936
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,730
Naki's all by yourself!

1937
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:05,910
I'll let you lock.

1938
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:10,770
Naki is all by herself.

1939
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:13,970
Eevee!

1940
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:14,150
Oh!

1941
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:15,110
Uh-oh.

1942
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:17,450
She found my body!

1943
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:19,030
Wait, I can finally see myself.

1944
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,390
I've never seen the boss or the big boss.

1945
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:21,890
Wait!

1946
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:23,610
Naki, I'm right there!

1947
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:25,370
Naki, notice me!

1948
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:26,170
Naki!

1949
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:27,090
Uh-oh.

1950
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:28,770
Naki, you're gonna die!

1951
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:29,350
Naki!

1952
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:31,810
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1953
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:32,290
Naki!

1954
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:34,130
That's a bracken!

1955
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:35,430
Goddammit!

1956
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:38,190
Is everyone going on me?

1957
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:38,810
That's crazy!

1958
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:42,750
You just love me, I guess.

1959
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:46,550
I don't know how to go back.

1960
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,850
I'm gonna have to go to the Bracken.

1961
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:49,450
Not Goku.

1962
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:51,550
I wonder if the Goku mod is broken.

1963
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:54,470
Yeah, creatures really love me.

1964
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:56,050
That's me.

1965
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:57,650
Does she not see me?

1966
01:18:58,470 --> 01:18:59,750
That is...

1967
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:01,350
Oh my god.

1968
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:02,050
Okay.

1969
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:02,870
Oh!

1970
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:04,290
Wait a minute.

1971
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:05,430
Can we pass this?

1972
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:06,830
Oh, bring her back.

1973
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:11,290
Oh my god, I can't tell if that's actually the the skim
walker or not.

1974
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:11,830
Got her?

1975
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:12,470
No!

1976
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:14,050
Wait, actually...

1977
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,650
No, I can't hear their voice.

1978
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:16,690
Yeah.

1979
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:18,850
Oh, oh, they can't tell either.

1980
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:20,910
There's so many of you!

1981
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:23,070
No, no, no, I'm not looking at you.

1982
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:23,810
I'm not looking at you.

1983
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:25,790
Naki!

1984
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:30,010
I had your body!

1985
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:31,070
I know, I saw.

1986
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:31,970
Oh, it's locked.

1987
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:33,010
I can use the key though.

1988
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:34,470
Okay.

1989
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:35,510
You...

1990
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:37,910
You were actually hearing them.

1991
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:38,670
They were hearing you.

1992
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:40,850
but everyone thought it was a skim walker.

1993
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:41,010
What?

1994
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:42,430
Really?

1995
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:43,190
Yeah.

1996
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:44,970
I think so at least.

1997
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:46,450
There's a room here.

1998
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:47,370
I got yippies.

1999
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,590
I also hear yourself.

2000
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:49,570
Cookie mold pin.

2001
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:50,670
Where are those items?

2002
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:52,110
Okay.

2003
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:53,990
I got cookie mold pin.

2004
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:58,130
I would have died if I didn't run into so many of the yippie
bugs.

2005
01:19:58,330 --> 01:19:59,430
I know there's so many.

2006
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:00,970
Oh, there's an item back there.

2007
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:01,690
They're so random.

2008
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:04,550
Would I make the jump though?

2009
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:05,190
Jump.

2010
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:05,770
Oh no.

2011
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:07,030
Parkour.

2012
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:07,630
Parkour.

2013
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:09,570
I will risk my life.

2014
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:10,490
I will risk my life.

2015
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:13,150
I could drop my items that I could try.

2016
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:13,970
Okay.

2017
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:14,710
Go, Amari.

2018
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:15,670
But what if you die?

2019
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:17,130
And I'm gonna be alone.

2020
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:18,750
What if you die?

2021
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:19,730
That's funny.

2022
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:20,930
Eevee.

2023
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:21,630
I'll go.

2024
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:22,630
I'll go.

2025
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:23,430
I'll go.

2026
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:24,090
It's okay.

2027
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:30,560
Yeah!

2028
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:31,960
Fire, core.

2029
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:32,860
Okay, okay.

2030
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,600
Now I just have to make it back.

2031
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,440
Wait, what is on that side?

2032
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,420
Now maybe I can jump to you and maybe there's like a next
one.

2033
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,420
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, true to do.

2034
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,300
Okay, you can do it.

2035
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:40,640
You can do it.

2036
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:40,940
You can do it.

2037
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:41,380
Just be careful.

2038
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,680
Yeah, grab the items.

2039
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:44,300
I don't know.

2040
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:44,540
Yeah.

2041
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:51,060
i feel like that too do i jump do i jump um just just get on
the ledge i think you could just walk onto it oh yeah yeah

2042
01:20:51,060 --> 01:21:01,280
and then um do a dash jump behind my drivers i'm not on
there i know ah gamer all right gamer that was so close

2043
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:11,780

should the window no i don't think so we just jump again i

2044
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:15,680
don't know i think oh there's a plastic fish in here.

2045
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,080
Oh, my hand's in the logo.

2046
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:18,900
There's so many things.

2047
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:19,900
Yeah, yeah, I can grab that.

2048
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:20,300
Nice.

2049
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,200
Maybe there's a door up there.

2050
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,920
Where did we come from?

2051
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:24,400
We came.

2052
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:28,460
Maybe we should go back that way, but I'm too scared to jump
again.

2053
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,820
I think it's hard to come back.

2054
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:34,340
Oh, no.

2055
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:37,880
Yeah.

2056
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:38,620
Okay.

2057
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:39,000
Do it.

2058
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:39,180
Okay.

2059
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:40,260
I'm going to jump.

2060
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:41,020
Do it.

2061
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:41,660
Okay.

2062
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,500
No, I think your loot is valuable, so I should jump.

2063
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,780
Okay, you can try.

2064
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:49,080
They're talking as if you're dying already.

2065
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:49,680
I know.

2066
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,260
You got this?

2067
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:52,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2068
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,040
We are done.

2069
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:53,740
Okay.

2070
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,180
Do it.

2071
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,100
Do it.

2072
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:56,660
For the company!

2073
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:00,010
Oh, nice, nice.

2074
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:00,370
Okay, game.

2075
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:01,150
Now it's right there.

2076
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:02,690
Okay.

2077
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:04,750
For the company!

2078
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:06,090
Woohoo!

2079
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:07,410
Yeah!

2080
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:08,310
Let's go back.

2081
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:08,770
Let's go back.

2082
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:09,190
Yeah.

2083
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:09,730
Let's go back.

2084
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:10,790
Gamers.

2085
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:12,750
Yeah, we've got a lot of items.

2086
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:13,990
I wonder what time it is.

2087
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:14,810
I feel like...

2088
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:16,470
Yeah, I think that item is very valuable.

2089
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:17,550
Where did we come from?

2090
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:19,330
Did we come from down or this way?

2091
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:23,810
Oh, I don't think there's anything crazy out there.

2092
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:26,110
I don't think we came from...

2093
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:28,290
Yeah, we came from the...

2094
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:29,030
Yeah, we came from the...

2095
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:29,410
Yeah, downstairs, yeah.

2096
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:30,510
All right.

2097
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:32,170
Here we go.

2098
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:34,690
Oh, yeah, we came through here.

2099
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:36,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2100
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:37,810
We unlocked the door, yeah.

2101
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:38,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2102
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:40,510
Here and then...

2103
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:41,790
Okay, I found it, I found it.

2104
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:43,190
Oh, well, they have a fire exit!

2105
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:45,110
Wait, is it the real fire exit?

2106
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:45,990
Oh!

2107
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:48,150
It's real, it's real.

2108
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:49,150
Oh, now it's real.

2109
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:53,630
How do I get back up?

2110
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:53,790
Yeah.

2111
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:56,530
I'll figure it out.

2112
01:22:57,730 --> 01:22:58,570
I got this.

2113
01:22:58,730 --> 01:22:59,390
They got this.

2114
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:00,810
I miss.

2115
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:06,630
I can't see the timer.

2116
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:07,350
Oh, neither.

2117
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:08,230
It doesn't say.

2118
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:09,430
Oh, it's just a tree.

2119
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:10,270
No, not that way.

2120
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:11,350
I'm going to the other way.

2121
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:12,690
I'm going to the other way.

2122
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:13,830
I'm going to...

2123
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:21,420
There's water.

2124
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,300
Water, water, water.

2125
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:23,180
Oh, it's flooded.

2126
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,780
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

2127
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:26,860
Oh, up here?

2128
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:29,660
Let's go back to the bridge, maybe.

2129
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,940
I mean, it looks like man, but different colors.

2130
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:33,620
Yeah, yeah.

2131
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:35,800
Oh, there we go.

2132
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,720
Oh my god.

2133
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:42,500
We take the concrete bridge or the other one.

2134
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:44,720
Oh my gosh, it's so dark.

2135
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,300
Okay, let's take the car.

2136
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just follow.

2137
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:49,420
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

2138
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,880
I don't see any giants.

2139
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:53,840
They're okay.

2140
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:55,160
Okay.

2141
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:56,660
Three more stairs.

2142
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:57,760
But it's foggy.

2143
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:58,820
It's really foggy.

2144
01:23:59,080 --> 01:23:59,540
It's dark.

2145
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,020
Okay, it is foggy.

2146
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:02,680
Oh boy.

2147
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:05,380
I don't see anything.

2148
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:06,320
Where's the ship?

2149
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,220
Oh, no.

2150
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:07,620
I don't know.

2151
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,080
It's over here.

2152
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,080
Found it.

2153
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,340
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

2154
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:11,940
Okay, okay.

2155
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,020
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2156
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,320
Nice, nice, nice.

2157
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:16,240
Nice.

2158
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:16,460
Oh.

2159
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:17,920
Okay.

2160
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:18,780
What?

2161
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,320
What?

2162
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,540
There's like no monsters.

2163
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:22,640
It's crazy.

2164
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:23,260
Okay.

2165
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,520
Oh, okay.

2166
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,360
Very, very lucky.

Yeah, super lucky.

01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,160
Okay.

2170
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:40,320
Um, since, since Naki and Mint aren't here, I think, uh,
they might not be back.

2171
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:41,420
Yeah, yeah.

2172
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,240

I'm gonna make it to the quarter?

2197
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:46,300
It's an increase.

2198
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:47,520
Alright.

2199
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:48,440
I think we'll be okay.

2200
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,200
Oh.

2201
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:50,760
Let's try our best.

2202
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,080
One day left.

2203
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,560
I'm gonna go to Adamant.

2204
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:56,160
Yeah.

2205
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:59,180
We can sell our spray cans if we need to and stuff.

2206
01:25:59,300 --> 01:25:59,600
Yeah.

2207
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:01,280
Oh, okay.

01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:02,500
All right.

2209
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,780
High five, Ayla, Samma.

2210
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,020
High five.

2211
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:06,680
How do you high five?

2212
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:07,820
I don't know.

2213
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:09,180
We can have a point instead.

2214
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:11,100
Good point.

2215
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,160
Touch fingers.

2216
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,120
Clap at you.

2217
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:15,700
Touch fingers.

2218
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:16,320
Yeah.

2219
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,160
E.T.

2220
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:17,640
touches.

2221
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:20,760
Oh, yeah, I got a...

2222
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:21,260
Oh, sorry.

2223
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:22,180
All right, here we go.

2224
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,280
Let's go!

2225
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,840
I believe it's copying my voice.

2226
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,060
I drink water.

2227
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:36,980
I thought I was gonna die from falling.

2228
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:37,980
I'm so glad.

2229
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:38,660
Wait, what?

2230
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,580
Oh, are we back?

2231
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:41,320
Yeah.

2232
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:43,260
All right.

2233
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:44,980
Let's go.

2234
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,100
Oh, where is it?

2235
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,460
I think the first time I nailed that jump, like, back and
forth without dying.

2236
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,140
to go up that thing.

2237
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:55,540
Oh, okay.

2238
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:56,680
What is that?

2239
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,900
Oh, I think this...

2240
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,220
Oh, my gosh.

2241
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,220
Oh, it scared me!

2242
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,540
It's this thing again.

2243
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,220
You can fly now.

2244
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:09,440
It's dragging you right here.

2245
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,700
Fly me across!

2246
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:15,560
Nope.

2247
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:21,170
Come on over.

2248
01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:22,990
The water's fine.

2249
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:26,610
Nice.

2250
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:29,130
Hey.

2251
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:37,470
Oh, I'm not here.

2252
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:39,070
Oh, I'm not here.

2253
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:39,510
I'm right now.

2254
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:41,670
Oh, whoa, whoa.

2255
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:42,830
She's flying around.

2256
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:43,950
Am I actually flying?

2257
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:45,450
I think it was.

2258
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:45,710
Yeah.

2259
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:46,530
Yeah.

2260
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:47,390
More than one to fly.

2261
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:47,950
Oh.

2262
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:48,750
It's so cool.

2263
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:50,550
Whoa.

2264
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:51,990
Here we go.

2265
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:53,510
Here we go.

2266
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:54,730
Alright, we should go around.

2267
01:27:57,170 --> 01:27:58,210
Oh, I like two.

2268
01:27:58,270 --> 01:27:59,830
Oh, there's something here.

2269
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:03,090
Oh, oh- Oh, oh, there- What?

2270
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:05,590
It's the guy, it's the guy.

2271
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:06,770
Freddie Fazbear!

2272
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,290
I'm Freddy Fazbear!

2273
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:12,250
Oh my God, I'm Freddie Fazbear!

2274
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:15,430
Oh.

2275
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:16,810
Oh!

2276
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:18,210
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2277
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:18,890
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2278
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:35,280
I like those guys.

2279
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,400
They're fun.

2280
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,960
We found Freddy.

2281
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,280
Oh, oh, oh.

2282
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:40,340
Oh, is that him?

2283
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,320
Did someone grab Freddy?

2284
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:42,920
Oh, there's an item here.

2285
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,440
Yeah.

2286
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:44,300
Oh, a horse.

2287
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:45,380
A horse.

2288
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:49,920
A horse.

2289
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:52,240
A horse.

2290
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:53,300
A horse.

2291
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:55,380
A horse.

2292
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,880
I don't think there's anything else.

2293
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,420
Nah, it's empty.

2294
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:01,160
Why I have to go another way?

2295
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,560
It's just me.

2296
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:18,680
This is you.

2297
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,260
It's Freddy Fazbear.

2298
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:21,600
Freddy Fazbear.

2299
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:24,040
I got a present!

2300
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:24,660
Gotcha!

2301
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:25,920
Gotcha!

2302
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:26,880
Wait.

2303
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:27,560
I gotta do it here.

2304
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:28,660
I'm gonna wait for the question.

2305
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:29,060
Naki?

2306
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:29,600
I see.

2307
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,200
All right.

2308
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:31,240
I got you.

2309
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:36,340
Oh, it's that thing again.

2310
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:37,360
Just hug the wall.

2311
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:37,940
Hug the wall.

2312
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:38,060
Be careful.

2313
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:38,840
Yeah.

2314
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:39,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2315
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:40,800
All right.

2316
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,220
Oh, be careful.

2317
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,260
At least it's life this time, you know?

2318
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:45,680
Hug the wall.

2319
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:47,380
Yeah.

2320
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:48,780
Oh, gotcha.

2321
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,440
It's copying your voice.

2322
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,600
We should open...

2323
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:54,260
Wait, I don't know.

2324
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:55,520
Maybe we should open outside.

2325
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:56,680
We should open outside.

2326
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:59,660
I heard the skim walker.

2327
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:00,720
Come on, guys.

2328
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:06,500
Alrighty.

2329
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:09,940
Happy birthday to us!

2330
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:12,160
It's about!

2331
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:13,660
It's about!

2332
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,780
Oh, nice, yeah.

2333
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:18,540
That's what I love.

2334
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:20,540
Let's go.

2335
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:22,500
Let's go!

2336
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:24,620
I only...

2337
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:24,860
Alright.

2338
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,120
Can we bring it back on the ship?

2339
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:27,860
Yeah we can take our stuff back for now.

2340
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2341
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,100
Let's go.

2342
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,300
Alright, maybe pass.

2343
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:36,120
I know.

2344
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:37,780
I love that you're horrid.

2345
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,660
Did you think she's good?

2346
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:43,220
Alright.

2347
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:45,200
.

2348
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:45,320
.

2349
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:53,120
Oh, it's this thing again.

2350
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:57,160
Oh, we're in.

2351
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:59,060
I hope this doesn't explode.

2352
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:01,120
Oh, thank goodness.

2353
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:02,660
Okay.

2354
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:05,940
Wait, where's Freddy?

2355
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:06,820
Where's Freddy?

2356
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:07,980
Oh, I don't know who has Freddy.

2357
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:08,780
I got her.

2358
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:09,600
Oh, there we go.

2359
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:10,040
There we go.

2360
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:11,520
Okay, I think we're good.

2361
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,700
Freddy Fazbear is worth how much?

2362
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:17,320
That guy's priceless.

2363
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:19,720
Oh, Airhorn is 60.

2364
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:20,100
Wow.

2365
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,200
I think we're good.

2366
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:24,320
We did already.

2367
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,800
I think we can go back in though.

2368
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:27,700
It's still kind of earlier.

2369
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:28,800
Oh, okay.

2370
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:29,520
Sorry, sorry.

2371
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,020
My bad.

2372
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:33,400
Oh!

2373
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:00,890
Hold on, I'll try going.

2374
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:14,160
Um, Come here, come here.

2375
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:17,500
Oh, I took some damage.

2376
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:18,040
Me too.

2377
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:19,460
I took damage also.

2378
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,320
I think we just gotta...

2379
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,140
Yeah, I think you just gotta take it.

2380
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,940
Just gotta run past him.

2381
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:29,180
Oh, is this a jump?

2382
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:29,780
No, no, no, no.

2383
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:30,700
I'm not doing it again.

2384
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:31,240
Hey, go.

2385
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:31,840
Wait, shoot.

2386
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,040
He's got shoo.

2387
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:33,760
Shoo.

2388
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:34,220
Shoo.

2389
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:38,340
Guys, okay?

2390
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,360
Shoo, shoo.

2391
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:40,740
Shoo, shoo, shoo.

2392
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:42,060
Shoo, shoo.

2393
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:42,960
Get off me, ah!

2394
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:48,160
Okay, let's go back inside before we...

2395
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,340
Okay, let's go!

2396
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:52,860
I think so!

2397
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:56,560
Ready to go earlier?

2398
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,240
I think it went there.

2399
01:32:58,500 --> 01:32:59,160
I don't remember.

2400
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:13,650
Did they die?

2401
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:14,950
I

2402
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:19,600
think so.

2403
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:20,480
Do you think they died?

2404
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,460
I think so.

2405
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,460
Let's just go back.

2406
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:25,820
Okay.

2407
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:26,940
Let's just go back.

2408
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:29,040
Going back inside was a mistake!

2409
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:30,260
Go away!

2410
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,380
Go away, we're trying to go home!

2411
01:33:39,410 --> 01:33:42,430
Away from the bridge, away from the bridge.

2412
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:14,550
I think everybody died.

2413
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:18,050
I think everybody died.

2414
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:19,970
No!

2415
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:22,150
Oh my

2416
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,300
god, we shouldn't have gone backwards.

2417
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,640
We shouldn't have...

2418
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:40,940
I think we're 12.

2419
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:41,620
I think we're fine.

2420
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:42,880
Yeah, it's only 12.

2421
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:43,520
I think it's fine.

2422
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:48,660
We'll just sell Freddy Fazbear for a guy.

2423
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:51,200
Yeah, Freddy's worth a lot, and so is a bow.

2424
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:53,840
No, the air horns are worth 60, so I think we can...

2425
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:54,760
Yeah, I think we're good.

2426
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:55,560
Yeah, whoa!

2427
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:55,960
Really?

2428
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:56,400
Wow.

2429
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:57,380
Yeah, yeah.

2430
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:00,180
We have two air horns, so that's 120 already.

2431
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:02,340
Yeah, we got this.

2432
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:07,340
Are we gonna sell him?

2433
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,760
I think so.

2434
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:10,360
I don't know.

2435
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:11,800
We might have to.

2436
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,520
We could turn him if we don't have to.

2437
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:15,600
31.

2438
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:16,960
I mean...

2439
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:18,800
Maybe we could spare him.

2440
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:20,220
No, we care.

2441
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,880
Airhorn has a higher value than Freddy Fazbear.

2442
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:24,840
Freddy Fazbear's worth nothing.

2443
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:27,760
Did Freeman cost more than Freddy?

2444
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:29,300
Yeah, I think so.

2445
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:30,420
I...

2446
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:30,920
I don't know.

2447
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:33,420
But, well, we can check.

2448
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:34,800
Okay.

2449
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,480
Save him for last, I guess, maybe.

2450
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,760
I never actually got to see...

2451
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:38,520
Yeah, yeah.

2452
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:39,740
What's this?

2453
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:40,560
Okay.

2454
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:44,820
Oh, we don't have a cat anymore.

2455
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:44,940
Oh.

2456
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,180
Oh, everything's gone.

2457
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:47,860
Aww.

2458
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:50,880
Oh, my wonderful art.

2459
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:52,960
It's up for you.

2460
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:56,920
Okay, maybe...

2461
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:57,660
Is that all?

2462
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,360
Oh, I forgot the egg.

2463
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:00,260
Okay.

2464
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:02,700
Oh, watch out!

2465
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:03,040
Watch out!

2466
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:04,360
Watch out!

2467
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:07,860
Oh, he didn't come out.

2468
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:08,620
He's hungry!

2469
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:11,440
He'll come, he's gonna come.

2470
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:20,760
That was close.

2471
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,560
That was...

2472
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:25,140
Oh, we made quota!

2473
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:27,980
We're good.

2474
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:29,060
Okay, we're okay.

2475
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:29,680
We're okay.

2476
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,340
Yeah.

2477
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:33,820
Maybe this is enough.

2478
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:38,820
Maybe this is enough.

2479
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:39,740
Yeah.

2480
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:41,320
Did you hit it?

2481
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:41,780
Please.

2482
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:47,150
Feast.

2483
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:49,070
Feast, my child.

2484
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:51,430
Fish.

2485
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:53,550
He's nervous.

2486
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:54,770
There we go.

2487
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:58,430
One swipe.

2488
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:01,130
Hi there.

2489
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:01,490
Hi there.

2490
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:01,910
Hi there.

2491
01:37:02,130 --> 01:37:02,190
Hi there.

2492
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:02,270
Hi there.

2493
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:03,010
Oh, 141.

2494
01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:03,870
Nice.

2495
01:37:04,630 --> 01:37:05,710
Oh, the bells.

2496
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:06,770
I think we're pretty rich.

2497
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:08,450
We are.

2498
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:09,310
Yeah.

2499
01:37:09,310 --> 01:37:09,590
We can.

2500
01:37:09,970 --> 01:37:11,730
Oh, we left the rubber ducky here.

2501
01:37:12,490 --> 01:37:13,150
It's okay.

2502
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:14,150
He's good.

2503
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:14,790
Yeah, he could stay there.

2504
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:15,810
Yeah, he could stay there.

2505
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:18,530
You're so pretty.

2506
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:19,450
Oh, you're gonna buy flashlight?

2507
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:21,630
Yeah, because I'm a chicken.

2508
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:22,330
Ooh, he's sold.

2509
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:23,470
I'm a chicken.

2510
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:26,650
Oh, how do I quit terminal?

2511
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:27,470
Okay, there we go.

2512
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:29,130
Okay, you guys can use it now.

2513
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:29,990
Oh!

2514
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:31,490
How much we got?

2515
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:32,760
I think we got 400.

2516
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:33,990
400!

2517
01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:38,610
Hey, how many flashlights did you buy?

2518
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:41,190
I only bought one.

2519
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:42,470
Oh, I should have bought for everyone.

2520
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:44,150
It's okay.

2521
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:46,730
I don't use them, so...

2522
01:37:46,730 --> 01:37:48,210
I don't use the flashlights.

2523
01:37:48,930 --> 01:37:49,310
I'm sorry.

2524
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:51,250
I'll buy one.

2525
01:37:51,930 --> 01:37:52,610
I'll buy one.

2526
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:55,890
I'll buy a profile.

2527
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,430
I'm gonna get it.

2528
01:37:57,510 --> 01:37:58,450
I'm gonna get it.

2529
01:37:58,550 --> 01:37:59,090
I'm gonna get it.

2530
01:37:59,210 --> 01:37:59,950
It's mine.

2531
01:38:00,230 --> 01:38:02,190
Oh, there you go.

2532
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:04,230
How do I use this?

2533
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:05,290
There you go.

2534
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:06,730
Am I bright?

2535
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:08,310
Yeah.

2536
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:10,410
I can see your iPad.

2537
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:11,210
Do you have an iPad?

2538
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:12,250
I have an iPad!

2539
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:14,150
Yeah, you do!

2540
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:20,830
Enter.

2541
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:22,830
I like your bunny ears.

2542
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:25,610
Oh, you have bunny ears?

2543
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:26,510
Yeah, you do.

2544
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:28,390
Oh.

2545
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:29,750
Nice.

2546
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:33,630
Cool.

2547
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:35,670
Oh, there's one more.

2548
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:36,850

I don't have a weapon.

2552
01:38:44,770 --> 01:38:45,250
Chombo!

2553
01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:48,810
Maybe the weapon.

2554
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:55,250
Um, um, a shovel.

2555
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:56,350
40% off.

2556
01:38:56,970 --> 01:38:57,770
Ooh, nice.

2557
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:58,490
Did you guys get the flashlight?

2558
01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:01,670
There should have been two, I think.

2559
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:02,230
A what?

2560
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:04,410
It should have been two flashlights.

2561
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:05,970
Guys, grab them or...

2562
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:07,030
Because I couldn't find the other one.

2563
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:09,350
I got mine, the one I ordered.

2564
01:39:09,530 --> 01:39:10,050
Let me go check.

2565
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:12,530
I didn't see it.

2566
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:14,110
I didn't see it.

2567
01:39:14,890 --> 01:39:15,330
Where's all?

2568
01:39:15,370 --> 01:39:16,750
I bought an extra shovel.

2569
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:18,230
But it already is.

2570
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:19,370
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2571
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:20,170
Watch out, watch out.

2572
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:21,430
There it is.

2573
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:22,930
Wow.

Logically.

Order one more.

2577
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:41,270

01:39:44,030 --> 01:39:44,970
I couldn't knock the door.

2581
01:39:47,210 --> 01:39:49,090
It should have came in the thing.

2583
01:39:50,770 --> 01:39:51,650
Loud horn.

A hundred.

2585
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:54,430
Translator?

2586
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:56,270
What do you need a translator for?

2587
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:57,990

01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,500
We are shoveled.

How long did you have it in there for?

2596
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:53,480
What's a flash?

01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,540

You could.

Where are we heading?

2618
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:29,660
Moons?

2619
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:30,760
Where are the murder?

2620
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:32,280
Um...

2621
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:32,920
Break this ship.

2622
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:33,480
What is...

2623
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:34,960
Oh, there's Dine.

2624
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:36,300
Can we go there?

2625
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,580
I don't know, Zala is...

2626
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:39,800
I don't know what the numbers mean.

2627
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:41,180
He's in one company anymore.

2628
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:42,820
She's losing it.

2629
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:44,940
She's on her stride.

2630
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:47,160
She's on, oh my god!

2631
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,580
Restrain her, restrain her!

2632
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:51,620
Oh my gosh, you hurt me!

2633
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:56,180
I'm sorry.

2634
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:59,500
You need to get a, this is a team playing game.

2635
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:00,000
It's okay.

2636
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:00,460
It's okay.

2637
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,220
You need to get yourself together.

2638
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:02,580
I'll take it.

2639
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:04,540
We need to work as a team.

2640
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:05,240
Oh, sorry.

2641
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:06,820
I'll stay out of the ship.

2642
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:08,820
Wait, what happens if you guys fly and I stay out of the
ship?

2643
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:10,980
This is why company needs to provide...

2644
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:11,900
I think we actually...

2645
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:12,540
No, I think it's...

2646
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:13,680
I think you come back in.

2647
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:14,400
True.

2648
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:15,860
Oh, really?

2649
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:16,700
Let's see.

2650
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:17,260
We can check.

2651
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:19,520
Can we go to Dine?

2652
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:20,220
Dine?

2653
01:42:21,620 --> 01:42:22,840
Oh, it's 600.

2654
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:23,500
Just kidding.

2655
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,740
There we go.

2656
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:28,560
What's Vow?

2657
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:30,820
I'm on top of the world.

2658
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:31,620
Oh, okay.

2659
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:33,000
We're going to Vow.

2660
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:34,020
Okay.

2661
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:35,000
Woo!

2662
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:36,620
Oh, never mind!

2663
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,680
We have to start the ship.

2664
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:41,120
Oh, okay, okay.

2665
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:41,340
Nice.

2666
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:42,580
Yushika!

2667
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:45,400
I'm outside!

2668
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:48,100
I can see the ship fly!

2669
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:49,420
Where are you?

2670
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:50,800
Aya-sama!

2671
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:54,660
Come on.

2672
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:55,280
Oh, I'm back.

2673
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:56,700
Oh, okay, okay.

2674
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:00,400
I thought I could see the ship fly from outside, but...

2675
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,700
You can if you jump off it entirely, I think.

2676
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:03,940
Oh!

2677
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:07,020
We got overtime bonus now.

2678
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:07,720
Yippee!

2679
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:10,800
We got overtime bonus.

2680
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:11,460
Okay.

2681
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:12,180
Moons.

2682
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:13,500
Okay.

2683
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:15,560
No problem.

2684
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:18,300
Here we go.

2685
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,400
Here we go.

2686
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:27,740
It's good to land.

2687
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:30,200
La la la la.

2688
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:32,240
La na na na.

2689
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:32,840
La la la.

2690
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:35,300
I love when she starts singing.

2691
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:37,080
Oh, I need a couple seconds.

2692
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,100
Oh, yeah.

2693
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:41,280
There's a moon with a mansion.

2694
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:41,820
That might be fun.

2695
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:44,980
Yeah, I want to go there, but we have to pay a lot of money
for it.

2696
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:46,020
Oh, there's a big pumpkin.

2697
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:47,020
Is this a pumpkin?

2698
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:49,180
Oh, is this a pumpkin?

2699
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:50,920
Smash the pumpkins.

2700
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,680
Smash the pumpkins.

2701
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:55,060
Oh, oh, so.

2702
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:56,800
I didn't know you like pumpkins that much.

2703
01:43:58,300 --> 01:43:59,340
I also like pumpkins.

2704
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:00,440
Pumpkins are pretty good.

2705
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:02,100
Not that much, yeah.

2706
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:04,120
Freddy.

2707
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:05,180
Hey, what?

2708
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:07,760
I'm counting on you for dinner.

2709
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:08,160
Yeah.

2710
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:12,800
Where is it?

2711
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:14,140
I think it's this way.

2712
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:14,440
Oh,

2713
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:18,060
yeah.

2714
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,120
There's a beehive.

2715
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:26,460
Ah!

2716
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:40,030
Watch out!

2717
01:44:40,030 --> 01:44:40,490
Hello!

2718
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:47,170
Come on over the water.

2719
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:49,950
They're ready to bong.

2720
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:50,710
Yeah!

2721
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:52,650
Oh my god.

2722
01:44:52,810 --> 01:44:55,250
What's that guy doing?

2723
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:58,090
He's just spinning.

2724
01:44:58,790 --> 01:44:59,470
That's what he said.

2725
01:45:00,910 --> 01:45:01,610
Let's go!

2726
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:07,810
Okay, we in.

2727
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:08,650
We're in.

2728
01:45:08,670 --> 01:45:09,670
Oh, I see something over here.

2729
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:11,190
Oh, I got tea kettle.

2730
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:12,850
Oh, I can't go.

2731
01:45:13,530 --> 01:45:15,370
Oh, there's a big room.

2732
01:45:16,050 --> 01:45:17,170
Is that something?

2733
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:18,070
Oh, it's a remover.

2734
01:45:18,710 --> 01:45:19,610
Wait, it's a...

2735
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:21,910
Oh, that can control things, actually.

2736
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:23,410
Really?

2737
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:24,110
Yeah.

2738
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:25,910
Wow.

2739
01:45:26,370 --> 01:45:26,610
Like,

2740
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:31,290
like, farm one?

2741
01:45:31,570 --> 01:45:32,290
Yeah, hold on.

2742
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:32,590
Watch.

2743
01:45:32,710 --> 01:45:33,970
Should I stand by this?

2744
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:43,390
Was that the...

2745
01:45:43,390 --> 01:45:44,050
No, never mind.

2746
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:44,850
That was the Whoopi Cushion.

2747
01:45:45,010 --> 01:45:46,290
I thought it was a sound of a mine.

2748
01:45:48,930 --> 01:45:50,130
Oh, a chemical.

2749
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:50,690
Jugg.

2750
01:45:53,790 --> 01:45:54,070
Nice.

2751
01:45:54,210 --> 01:45:54,990
It's so big, though.

2752
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:55,330
I know.

2753
01:45:55,590 --> 01:45:56,330
It's not in here.

2754
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:58,350
No, I don't think so.

2755
01:45:58,970 --> 01:46:01,090
There was like a way down here though.

2756
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:02,410
There's also a fire escape here.

2757
01:46:02,530 --> 01:46:05,590
Oh, that's a fire exit, but I'm not sure I trust in it.

2758
01:46:06,070 --> 01:46:07,050
Do we have that mod?

2759
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:08,930
It's not like a fire exit in it.

2760
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:10,370
I can't...

2761
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:14,850
Maybe it's safe.

2762
01:46:15,030 --> 01:46:15,490
Maybe it's safe.

2763
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:16,490
Alright.

2764
01:46:18,430 --> 01:46:19,930
I'm not sure I trust in it.

2765
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:20,630
I don't think so.

2766
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:21,530
We're fine.

2767
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:22,850
We know how to get out.

2768
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:23,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2769
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:29,420
What's this way?

2770
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:30,700
That's...

2771
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:31,200
Nothing.

2772
01:46:31,860 --> 01:46:32,760
That's a dead end.

2773
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:34,280
Oh, there's a way down.

2774
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:34,920
Yeah.

2775
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,880
It's the real down, right?

2776
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:39,020
Okay.

2777
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:42,000
I'm gonna put my stuff outside real quick.

2778
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:43,460
Yeah, I heard something too.

2779
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:46,500
Put it.

2780
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:52,860
Actually, I'm gonna bring the whoopee cushion.

2781
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:08,320
Oh, Yippie, you can kill it!

2782
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:09,280
Okay, okay.

2783
01:47:12,050 --> 01:47:14,050
Kill it with the thing!

2784
01:47:15,430 --> 01:47:16,050
Wait, where are they?

2785
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:18,210
Oh, how did you guys come down?

2786
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:19,250
I feel like they're over there.

2787
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:20,170
Are they there?

2788
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:21,250
Where are you guys?

2789
01:47:22,110 --> 01:47:22,510
Guys?

2790
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:23,210
Guys?

2791
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:24,310
Oh!

2792
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:26,370
Yippie, can we hit it with a shovel?

2793
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:27,390
Oh, they're over here!

2794
01:47:27,470 --> 01:47:28,110
Yeah, you can hit it.

2795
01:47:28,330 --> 01:47:28,930
Yeah, you can hit it, yeah.

2796
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:29,930
Yeah, kill it with the shovel!

2797
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:31,070
Hello!

2798
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:32,250
Hi!

2799
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:40,820
Yippie!

2800
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:42,880
Fuck it, fuck it.

2801
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:45,160
Kill it!

2802
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:45,700
Yeah!

2803
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:46,460
Yeah!

2804
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:47,940
Yeah!

2805
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:50,000
Ow!

2806
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:51,340
Ow!

2807
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:55,400
Wait, wait, wait.

2808
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:57,780
I think it's dead.

2809
01:47:59,100 --> 01:47:59,700
He's dead.

2810
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:01,860
We got him.

2811
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:03,920
Boy, we got him.

2812
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:06,640
Idiot, hippie bud.

2813
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:07,660
He's all toxic.

2814
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,000
He's all toxic.

2815
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:15,720
Is there anything else in here?

2816
01:48:15,820 --> 01:48:16,760
Can we take it home?

2817
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:17,720
No, salute.

2818
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:19,360
I don't think so.

2819
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:22,320
There is a mine over here.

2820
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:23,200
Yeah, there's a mine.

2821
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:23,960
Watch out.

2822
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:26,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2823
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:27,740
It's like right there.

2824
01:48:27,820 --> 01:48:28,320
Watch out.

2825
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:29,380
Just don't step on it.

2826
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:30,880
Let's not step on it.

2827
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:34,100
It's okay.

2828
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:35,180
You got it.

2829
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:36,480
Um.

2830
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:38,460
Ta-da!

2831
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:40,420
Okay.

2832
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:42,120
Can we get this way?

2833
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:44,340
Oh, there's another door.

2834
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:45,120
Hi!

2835
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,300
Oh, hi!

2836
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:50,220
You can go this way.

2837
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:51,660
You can go this way.

2838
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:52,300
Is that okay?

2839
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:55,080
Oh, I found something.

2840
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:55,940
Oh, a key!

2841
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,820
I got it.

2842
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:00,240
Nice.

2843
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:02,480
Oh, there's something in here.

2844
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:03,720
There's a magnifying glass!

2845
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:04,860
Magnifying glass!

2846
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:05,740
Let's go!

2847
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:09,440
We left a lot of stuff at the entrance too, so...

2848
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:10,420
Yeah, yeah, same.

2849
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:11,000
Okay.

2850
01:49:11,180 --> 01:49:11,560
Nice.

2851
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:13,560
I found a good amount.

2852
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,140
I can't tell, I can't see anything.

2853
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,140
Oh, it's okay, not right.

2854
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:20,460
Yeah, follow, I'll lead the way.

2855
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:21,440
I hear them laughing.

2856
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:23,780
Oh, this way?

2857
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:24,560
I think.

2858
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:25,180
Hello?

2859
01:49:25,860 --> 01:49:28,680
Um, I think there's something over there.

2860
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:29,540
What?

2861
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:30,240
What?

2862
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:31,180
What?

2863
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:32,760
Which way?

2864
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:34,020
Oh, this way.

2865
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:34,880
Okay, over there.

2866
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,320
Give me a piece.

2867
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:36,800
Oh.

2868
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:37,640
Oh.

2869
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:39,120
Oh.

2870
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:40,560
Oh.

01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:40,920
Oh.

2872
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:41,180
Oh.

2873
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:41,540
Oh.

2874
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:42,920
Where's the spot?

2875
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:43,600
Oh.

2876
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:45,000
Oh, um.

2877
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:46,740
Hello there.

2878
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:47,880
What do we do?

2879
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:49,420
I think you can kill it also, right?

2880
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:51,520
Yeah, you can kill it.

2881
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:55,020
Is that gonna be on the railing and kill it?

2882
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:55,780
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2883
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:57,280
Jump on the railing and kill it.

2884
01:49:57,420 --> 01:49:58,620
Oh, okay, okay, 50K.

2885
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,380
It's yelling, it's using our voices.

2886
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,140
Is your set and done, Dola?

2887
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:05,420
No, we can do it, come here, come here.

2888
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:07,300
You got this.

2889
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:09,140
Okay.

2890
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:13,020
I

2891
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:29,910
think it might be lurking, but it might be gone.

2892
01:50:30,170 --> 01:50:31,090
Okay, yeah, let's go out.

2893
01:50:31,210 --> 01:50:32,290
Let's leave, let's leave, let's leave.

2894
01:50:32,510 --> 01:50:33,470
Let's pick them up.

2895
01:50:33,570 --> 01:50:34,630
Can you grab their stuff?

2896
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:36,330
Yeah.

2897
01:50:36,810 --> 01:50:37,110

Ah, go, go, go, go, go.

2900
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:46,940
Your pants are full?

2901
01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:49,280
Yeah, with Ayla Samo.

2902
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:50,620

2903
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:51,760
Oh, your hands are full.

2904
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:53,240
Wait, what's the most expensive thing here?

2905
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:55,400
Do you think we can make it two times?

2906
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:56,900
This one's full.

2907
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,200
Okay, do you want to leave Ayla Samo?

2908
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:00,020
Yeah, sorry, Ayla Samo.

2909
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:02,200
And we'll come back for her.

2910
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:05,260
Because money is pretty important too.

2911
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:08,860
She's important, but money is like way important.

2912
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:09,680
Yeah, but money.

2913
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:10,840
Yeah, the money.

We'll come back.

2917
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:14,200
We'll come back.

2918
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:14,560
Oh, here.

2919
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:15,960
I'll take the stone bridge.

2920
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:16,600
You take that one.

2921
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:17,520

01:51:58,030 --> 01:51:58,470
Okay.

2927
01:51:59,850 --> 01:52:00,290

Oh, nice weapon cushion.

01:52:03,930 --> 01:52:05,370
No, I don't know.

2931
01:52:05,490 --> 01:52:06,890
The one Pikachu was only 14!

2932
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:17,220
Okay, how about I go grab the other stuff and you wait here?

2933
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:17,960

01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:24,260
To a lot of responsibility.

2940
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:24,930
Hold on.

2941
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:30,140

Welcome back.

2989
01:55:42,510 --> 01:55:47,590

employee.

2990
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:48,990
Oh.

2991

01:59:46,190 --> 01:59:47,550
I can hear it from inside.

3109
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:49,930
Oh, is that loud?

3173
02:02:04,380 --> 02:02:07,700
You guys, it's a spring, it's a spring back.

3174
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:08,840
It's a coil head!

3175
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:10,320
It's a coil head.

3176
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:12,780
Come on, come on, come on.

3177
02:02:12,780 --> 02:02:14,120
It follows you.

3178
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:15,140
It follows you.

3179
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:16,400
Really?

3180
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:18,000
Come on, come on.

3181
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:19,460
I'm like...

3182
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:21,180
We out?

3183
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:22,660
Yeah, yeah, you have to look it in.

3184
02:02:22,780 --> 02:02:25,120
Wait, is this the dog?

3185
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:26,920
It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me.

3186
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:27,360
All right.

3187
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:30,260
Wait, you guys, I can't turn around.

3188
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:31,420
Where are you?

3189
02:02:37,230 --> 02:02:37,370
Johnny!

3190
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:44,630
Okay.

3191
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:47,690
This way?

3192
02:02:47,970 --> 02:02:48,690
All right.

3193
02:02:48,910 --> 02:02:49,210
Come, come.

3194
02:02:49,450 --> 02:02:49,930
Turn around.

3195
02:02:50,370 --> 02:02:50,430
Yeah.

3196
02:02:50,650 --> 02:02:51,450
And then let's close the door.

3197
02:02:53,070 --> 02:02:53,270
Nice.

3198
02:02:53,450 --> 02:02:53,590
Nice.

3199
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:56,030
This is a dead end.

3200
02:02:56,090 --> 02:02:56,310
Watch out.

3201
02:02:57,110 --> 02:02:57,910
Watch out.

3202
02:02:59,470 --> 02:03:00,870
Can you go through the...

3203
02:03:00,870 --> 02:03:02,590
There's no way out here.

3204
02:03:02,950 --> 02:03:03,150
Wait.

3205
02:03:03,450 --> 02:03:03,870
Are we trapped?

3206
02:03:04,410 --> 02:03:04,730
Are we trapped?

3207
02:03:05,770 --> 02:03:06,410
Yeah, we're trapped.

3208
02:03:06,530 --> 02:03:07,410
Yeah, this is a dead end.

3209
02:03:07,410 --> 02:03:08,930
Why did you guys hide in here?

3210
02:03:08,950 --> 02:03:09,990
Would you guys lead us to a den?

3211
02:03:11,810 --> 02:03:14,270
We can get around him, we can get around him.

3212
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:14,510
Yeah?

3213
02:03:14,730 --> 02:03:15,090
I think.

3214
02:03:18,650 --> 02:03:19,050
Hello.

3215
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:30,690
I'm looking at him.

3216
02:03:30,850 --> 02:03:31,330
You guys are good.

3217
02:03:31,530 --> 02:03:33,030
I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.

3218
02:03:35,030 --> 02:03:35,830
Okay, okay...

3219
02:03:35,830 --> 02:03:35,830
No.

3220
02:03:36,550 --> 02:03:37,810
No, this is a dead end.

3221
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:38,450
Okay.

3222
02:03:40,130 --> 02:03:41,330
Look at him, still.

3223
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:42,990
Look at him?

3224
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:45,950
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3225
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:47,370
We're going, we're going, we're going.

3226
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:50,680
But I can't see it.

3227
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:51,860
I can't see anything.

3228
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:52,780
I can't see anything.

3229
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:00,880
Okay.

3230
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:06,810
It's a dead one.

3231
02:04:07,170 --> 02:04:08,650
I think we're going to die.

3232
02:04:12,530 --> 02:04:13,690
We're going to die.

3233
02:04:13,690 --> 02:04:15,070
We're going to die.

3234
02:04:15,070 --> 02:04:16,910
We're going to die.

3235
02:04:17,310 --> 02:04:20,860
We're going to die.

3236
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:22,840
Really?

3237
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:22,900
We're going to die.

3238
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:22,920
We're going to die.

3239
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:23,500
We're going to die.

3240
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:24,520
We're going to die.

3241
02:04:24,660 --> 02:04:25,180
We're going to die.

3242
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:27,280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3243
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:40,080
Back here, back here.

3244
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:40,660
Where's this lady?

3245
02:04:41,180 --> 02:04:43,780
What do you need to?

3246
02:04:44,080 --> 02:04:46,480
Oh, he's right there, he's right there.

3247
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:46,780
Yeah,

3248
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:54,180
stop pushing me!

3249
02:04:54,380 --> 02:04:54,900
Stop pushing!

3250
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:04,580
Uh-oh.

3251
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:05,920
Uh-oh.

3252
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,720
Who am I hearing?

3253
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:10,840
Okay, where are we going?

3254
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:15,920
Hey, where are we going?

3255
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:21,660
I think we're There's a thought for...

3256
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:22,540
Um, let's go here.

3257
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:23,280
Here, here, here.

3258
02:05:23,380 --> 02:05:24,240
There's a door here.

3259
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:24,900
Okay.

3260
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:26,300
I don't know where it's here.

3261
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:28,320
Try.

3262
02:05:28,580 --> 02:05:29,640
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

3263
02:05:29,740 --> 02:05:30,720
Where's Goku?

3264
02:05:32,140 --> 02:05:32,920
Where's Goku?

3265
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:35,060
Yeah, why do we keep getting these guys?

3266
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:36,460
Oh shoot, it's a dead end!

3267
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:49,160
Yeah, I think that's the same door we went through before.

3268
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:50,020
Oh my god.

3269
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:50,560
What?

3270
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:52,260
It looks like the dead end.

3271
02:05:52,780 --> 02:05:53,000
Yeah.

3272
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:54,420
You can't go there.

3273
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,140
Tall and handsome.

3274
02:05:56,320 --> 02:05:57,240
Where do we go?

3275
02:05:57,380 --> 02:05:57,860
Where is it?

3276
02:05:58,920 --> 02:05:59,920
Oh my god.

3277
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:02,080
Uh...

3278
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:03,320
Uh...

3279
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:05,220
No, this one's the one with the theme.

3280
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:07,180
Watch yourself as well.

3281
02:06:07,540 --> 02:06:07,980
Sayonara!

3282
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:14,600
Wait, the thumper totally ignored me.

3283
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:15,980
Oh, never mind.

3284
02:06:18,380 --> 02:06:18,820
Sayonara!

3285
02:06:19,820 --> 02:06:20,260
Sayonara!

3286
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:25,240
I'm gonna leave it, I'm gonna leave it.

3287
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:26,620
I don't wanna be alone.

3288
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:28,720
I don't wanna be alone.

3289
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:29,980
Oh, there's a dead end.

3290
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:30,980
Oh, shoot.

3291
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:33,720
Is everybody dead?

3292
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:34,320
I'm lost!

3293
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:35,120
I'm lost!

3294
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:36,600
This is the dead end.

3295
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:37,520
Oh.

3296
02:06:38,260 --> 02:06:38,780
Are you dead?

3297
02:06:43,270 --> 02:06:43,550
Ah!

3298
02:06:44,210 --> 02:06:44,770
Ah!

3299
02:06:45,390 --> 02:06:45,950
Oh,

3300
02:06:55,860 --> 02:06:55,940
he's dead!

3301
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:57,520
Oh, she got him!

3302
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:00,860
Oh, he's still dead!

3303
02:07:01,820 --> 02:07:02,640
Oh my gosh.

3304
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:06,140
She's so dead!

3305
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:06,840
She's got the animal too.

3306
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:12,790
Yeah, that was knocking.

3307
02:07:13,830 --> 02:07:14,750
Who's yelling?

3308
02:07:14,830 --> 02:07:16,190
Can you find a way out, Aya-sama?

3309
02:07:16,870 --> 02:07:20,150
When I died, I dropped the animal so I- Just the three of
you.

3310
02:07:20,510 --> 02:07:21,670
I just did.

3311
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:28,060
I'll try to follow you.

3312
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:30,400
Oh no, he's blocking the way.

3313
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,080
Really?

3314
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:32,680
Yeah, I can't get up.

3315
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:32,700
Yeah, I can't get up.

3316
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:34,360
I think you can touch him.

3317
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,080
It's a dead end.

3318
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:37,740
It's a dead end.

3319
02:07:37,780 --> 02:07:40,200
Wait, did it just repeat the axle sound?

3320
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:41,980
I guess we're soft locked.

3321
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:44,740
I think the other monster is like...

3322
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:46,020
I might have.

3323
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:46,940
The skinwalker.

3324
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:48,020
Excuse me.

3325
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:52,660
Oh wait, they actually can't move?

3326
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:54,560
Oh no, I think he's actually blocking me.

3327
02:07:54,620 --> 02:07:55,620
Can I push him?

3328
02:07:57,120 --> 02:07:58,200
Push him away?

3329
02:07:58,460 --> 02:08:02,640
I think they have to not look and then...

3330
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:05,380
Yeah, they might have to like run for it.

3331
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:06,360
Maybe couch?

3332
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:07,300
Ah!

3333
02:08:08,820 --> 02:08:09,360
Oh!

3334
02:08:09,780 --> 02:08:12,120
There it is, there it is, there it is, there it is!

3335
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:13,180
Oh my god!

3336
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:14,880
My

3337
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:40,630
god, it's so funny.

3338
02:08:42,250 --> 02:08:43,370
I'm so paranoid.

3339
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:46,330
I don't know.

3340
02:08:47,690 --> 02:08:50,550
I don't think it's properly...

3341
02:08:50,550 --> 02:08:51,950
I don't think it's working, yeah.

3342
02:08:52,730 --> 02:08:54,170
We lost everything.

3343
02:08:54,890 --> 02:08:56,770
Have any of us, like, seen a bracken?

3344
02:08:57,030 --> 02:08:58,290
Yeah, we've seen the bracken.

3345
02:08:58,550 --> 02:08:58,770
Oh, really?

3346
02:08:59,010 --> 02:08:59,810
But it didn't work?

3347
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:01,310
No, it's okay.

3348
02:09:01,790 --> 02:09:03,870
Rip, rip, go cool.

3349
02:09:07,250 --> 02:09:09,390
They got him, they got him!

3350
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:11,570
Oh, man.

3351
02:09:12,110 --> 02:09:13,450
We lost everything.

3352
02:09:14,470 --> 02:09:16,950
Wait, someone said Val has high Goku chance?

3353
02:09:17,330 --> 02:09:17,510
Really?

3354
02:09:17,850 --> 02:09:18,870
Should I believe you?

3355
02:09:19,550 --> 02:09:20,470
I'm gonna believe you.

3356
02:09:20,950 --> 02:09:21,810
Can we go there?

3357
02:09:22,110 --> 02:09:23,130
It's a Goku a chance?

3358
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:24,310
It's foggy, though.

3359
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:25,390
It's foggy.

3360
02:09:26,250 --> 02:09:28,090
Ah, it's gonna be hard.

3361
02:09:28,830 --> 02:09:30,250
We gotta pick risks.

3362
02:09:30,490 --> 02:09:33,010
You know, we're at zero money here.

3363
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:33,650
You're right.

3364
02:09:34,190 --> 02:09:34,970
You're so right.

3365
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:36,790
Here we go.

3366
02:09:38,230 --> 02:09:39,070
Here we go.

3367
02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:40,530
No pain, no gain.

3368
02:09:40,750 --> 02:09:41,490
No pain.

3369
02:09:42,030 --> 02:09:42,830
No gain.

3370
02:09:43,030 --> 02:09:43,990
Let's go, baby.

3371
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:45,350
Yeah.

3372
02:09:46,810 --> 02:09:48,130
Goku in the fog.

3373
02:09:51,770 --> 02:09:52,150
Yeah.

3374
02:09:53,350 --> 02:09:53,730
Okay.

3375
02:09:55,150 --> 02:09:56,010
Let's go.

3376
02:09:57,150 --> 02:09:57,790
Oh, yeah.

3377
02:09:58,450 --> 02:09:58,470
Oh, yeah.

3378
02:09:58,470 --> 02:09:58,730
It's foggy.

3379
02:09:59,290 --> 02:10:00,550
Don't have any items, too.

3380
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:01,730
Now we got nothing.

3381
02:10:01,870 --> 02:10:02,990
Oh, my shovel.

3382
02:10:03,350 --> 02:10:04,710
Wait, how do we get to the...

3383
02:10:04,710 --> 02:10:05,430
Where's the door?

3384
02:10:06,570 --> 02:10:08,230
Uh, we keep scanning, I guess.

3385
02:10:08,490 --> 02:10:08,870
Yeah.

3386
02:10:09,150 --> 02:10:09,990
Just keep scanning.

3387
02:10:10,490 --> 02:10:11,330
We'll find it.

3388
02:10:11,410 --> 02:10:11,970
Here we go.

3389
02:10:12,310 --> 02:10:14,430
I think it's this way, actually, right?

3390
02:10:14,550 --> 02:10:15,190
Yeah, this way.

3391
02:10:15,190 --> 02:10:16,450
Yeah, the bridge?

3392
02:10:16,650 --> 02:10:17,610
Maybe we have to find the bridge.

3393
02:10:17,730 --> 02:10:18,590
Yeah, I think it's this way.

3394
02:10:25,210 --> 02:10:26,350
It's just Emory.

3395
02:10:26,550 --> 02:10:27,230
I got jumpskin.

3396
02:10:28,270 --> 02:10:29,610
I know I'm very scary.

3397
02:10:29,910 --> 02:10:30,590
Oh yeah, right here.

3398
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:32,750
Oh, there you go.

3399
02:10:32,830 --> 02:10:33,010
Nice!

3400
02:10:33,010 --> 02:10:34,090
With the concrete ones?

3401
02:10:34,230 --> 02:10:34,350
Yep.

3402
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:34,910
Oh, nice.

3403
02:10:35,430 --> 02:10:35,970
Where's Naki?

3404
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:38,070
Naki?

3405
02:10:38,910 --> 02:10:39,310
Naki?

3406
02:10:40,650 --> 02:10:41,050
Naki!

3407
02:10:42,130 --> 02:10:42,530
Naki!

3408
02:10:42,850 --> 02:10:43,650
You're lucky!

3409
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:44,450
Naki!

3410
02:10:45,950 --> 02:10:46,730
Uh oh.

3411
02:10:47,830 --> 02:10:48,830
She's not dead already.

3412
02:10:50,110 --> 02:10:51,030
There's no way.

3413
02:10:51,650 --> 02:10:52,190
Naki!

3414
02:10:52,790 --> 02:10:53,610
Maybe she's just left.

3415
02:10:53,890 --> 02:10:54,450
Naki!

3416
02:10:54,950 --> 02:10:55,810
Should I really show you what?

3417
02:10:56,510 --> 02:10:57,630
I'm gonna go inside.

3418
02:10:58,470 --> 02:10:58,750
Okay.

3419
02:10:58,910 --> 02:11:02,230
And you guys, if you find her, bring her over.

3420
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:07,680
Right there.

3421
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:09,020
All right.

3422
02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:16,120
Actually, it's quite spooky being in here by myself.

3423
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:18,440
What if it's the word Goku?

3424
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:21,420
Oh, you made it!

3425
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:23,120
Yeah!

3426
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:26,260
They're looking- Yeah, they're looking for you outside.

3427
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:27,500
Here, let's go tell them.

3428
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:36,780
It's okay, it's you in half!

3429
02:11:37,220 --> 02:11:39,080
Hi, Naki's inside!

3430
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:41,640
I found a way!

3431
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:42,920
Is that you?

3432
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:42,960
Yeah.

3433
02:11:43,100 --> 02:11:44,040
Is that you, Naki?

3434
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:44,700
Yeah.

3435
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:46,940
Oh my god, Emory went to look for you!

3436
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:47,940
Sorry, I was lost, yeah.

3437
02:11:48,420 --> 02:11:50,260
Oh my god, Emory went to look for you.

3438
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,400
Okay, Emory will come back, it's fine.

3439
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:53,020
Yeah, yeah.

3440
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:55,980
Now we gotta find Emily.

3441
02:11:56,700 --> 02:11:57,220
Emily!

3442
02:11:58,040 --> 02:11:58,560
Emily!

3443
02:12:00,580 --> 02:12:02,620
How did she navigate in this fog?

3444
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:03,580
It's so hard.

3445
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:04,880
You should have just left me.

3446
02:12:08,440 --> 02:12:09,600
How did you get that?

3447
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:10,020
Emily!

3448
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:11,220
Yeah, I got this.

3449
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:13,480
But...

3450
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:13,820
Emily!

3451
02:12:15,620 --> 02:12:16,940
I'm gonna go back in.

3452
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:18,480
I

3453
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:24,420
don't know why Emily might be lost.

3454
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:26,380
Yeah, maybe.

3455
02:12:30,460 --> 02:12:32,680
Money over friendship.

3456
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:39,240
Nothing.

3457
02:12:40,260 --> 02:12:40,740
Goku.

3458
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:42,920
Goku.

3459
02:12:43,060 --> 02:12:44,280
Did you sacrifice myself?

3460
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:45,780
Yeah.

3461
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:47,520
Boy, you can find something.

3462
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,740
Yeah, we gotta find a little bit.

3463
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:50,320
Go.

3464
02:12:51,020 --> 02:12:51,280
Yay!

3465
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:53,280
Oh, everyone's here!

3466
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:55,600
Yippee!

3467
02:12:56,680 --> 02:12:58,200
I almost got lost again.

3468
02:12:58,220 --> 02:12:58,660
How do you guys find me?

3469
02:12:58,740 --> 02:12:59,440
It's that far.

3470
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:08,140
Oh, it's another freaking name.

3471
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:09,400
Yeah, I hate these ones.

3472
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:10,940
Oh, there's something.

3473
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:11,320
There's something.

3474
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:12,240
Oh, no, he's okay.

3475
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:12,740
He's okay.

3476
02:13:13,680 --> 02:13:14,160
Oh, he's okay?

3477
02:13:14,540 --> 02:13:14,940
Yeah.

3478
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:19,220
He'll leave you, though.

3479
02:13:19,580 --> 02:13:20,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3480
02:13:20,860 --> 02:13:23,500
Just don't get too close to him, you know.

3481
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:26,660
He wants personal space, I guess.

3482
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:28,660
Yeah, actually, I don't know where he is, though.

3483
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:31,220
That's too dark.

3484
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:32,600
Oh, and here is a big room.

3485
02:13:32,620 --> 02:13:34,760
Oh, there's a lot in here.

3486
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:36,400
Oh, dude!

3487
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:37,660
Wow.

3488
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:38,640
Nice.

3489
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:39,840
My hands are cool.

3490
02:13:40,540 --> 02:13:41,460
Oh, do you want me to carry something?

3491
02:13:42,260 --> 02:13:42,780
I can carry.

3492
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:43,800
I'm good.

3493
02:13:44,140 --> 02:13:45,940
Oh, there's a staircase over here, too.

3494
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:48,820
Oh, I'm going to go down.

3495
02:13:49,860 --> 02:13:50,260
Goku.

3496
02:13:53,340 --> 02:13:53,520
Goku.

3497
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:53,960
Goku.

3498
02:13:54,940 --> 02:13:55,160
Goku.

3499
02:13:55,660 --> 02:13:55,860
Goku.

3500
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:58,820
Goku What

3501
02:14:02,020 --> 02:14:02,600
the heck?

3502
02:14:02,820 --> 02:14:03,040
Oh really?

3503
02:14:03,060 --> 02:14:03,740
This voice was that?

3504
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:05,340
Not only one, but two.

3505
02:14:06,740 --> 02:14:07,140
Wow.

3506
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:08,000
That's steel.

3507
02:14:08,900 --> 02:14:08,980
Nice.

3508
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:09,340
Mm-hmm.

3509
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:10,760
Double.

3510
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:11,620
Double.

3511
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:13,060
Okay, I got hairbrushes.

3512
02:14:14,020 --> 02:14:15,560
I didn't fully inspect this room yet.

3513
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:16,120
Is there anything else?

3514
02:14:16,180 --> 02:14:16,580
Oh yeah.

3515
02:14:17,420 --> 02:14:18,500
Let's check up this room.

3516
02:14:19,220 --> 02:14:19,680
Oh there is?

3517
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:20,000
Oh yeah.

3518
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:21,120
Oh there's more.

3519
02:14:21,580 --> 02:14:22,280
Here I'll check up.

3520
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:25,100
Yeah, I don't like the sound of that though.

3521
02:14:25,540 --> 02:14:25,940
Yeah.

3522
02:14:26,360 --> 02:14:28,340
Is it the fog, the steam?

3523
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:29,040
Yeah.

3524
02:14:29,060 --> 02:14:31,420
Oh no, it's just this thing.

3525
02:14:32,060 --> 02:14:32,980
It's just the power.

3526
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:35,340
Oh, yeah.

3527
02:14:35,980 --> 02:14:37,320
Oh, I can't flip the switch.

3528
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:38,760
I can't see any.

3529
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:40,940
Oh, there we go.

3530
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:43,940
Oh, there's a lot of stuff down here.

3531
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:44,980
There's a lot of stuff down here.

3532
02:14:45,380 --> 02:14:46,620
Yeah, it seems like it.

3533
02:14:48,060 --> 02:14:49,320
Oh, oh, sorry.

3534
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:50,180
Oh, right here.

3535
02:14:50,380 --> 02:14:51,020
I'm a liar.

3536
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:52,700
I can hold stuff.

3537
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:53,500
I'm a liar.

3538
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:54,480
There's nothing here.

3539
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:55,420
Oh, there's nothing here.

3540
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:56,980
It just looks like it.

3541
02:14:56,980 --> 02:14:57,800
It gasped, you know.

3542
02:14:57,820 --> 02:14:58,960
It really, I thought that.

3543
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:01,160
I thought this shadow was something.

3544
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:01,660
Yeah.

3545
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:03,800
Yeah, it's Lee, you.

3546
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:04,800
Goku, Goku.

3547
02:15:06,500 --> 02:15:09,960
I think she's being really adventurous.

3548
02:15:12,220 --> 02:15:12,360
Oh!

3549
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:13,560
Oh!

3550
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:13,740
Oh!

3551
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:14,760
He's here again!

3552
02:15:17,890 --> 02:15:18,670
It's okay.

3553
02:15:21,230 --> 02:15:21,770
Uh-oh.

3554
02:15:21,930 --> 02:15:23,030
We gotta go back.

3555
02:15:23,490 --> 02:15:23,950
Bye.

3556
02:15:24,790 --> 02:15:25,070
Bye.

3557
02:15:25,070 --> 02:15:27,030
Have any of us, like, seen a bracken?

3558
02:15:27,630 --> 02:15:28,030
Bye!

3559
02:15:28,670 --> 02:15:29,190
Oh, wait!

3560
02:15:29,450 --> 02:15:30,070
Where is it?

3561
02:15:30,250 --> 02:15:31,150
I'm looking at him!

3562
02:15:32,150 --> 02:15:32,730
Oh god.

3563
02:15:33,610 --> 02:15:33,730
Oh.

3564
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:37,550
Do we go down or over here?

3565
02:15:37,930 --> 02:15:38,210
Down?

3566
02:15:39,230 --> 02:15:39,590
Down?

3567
02:15:40,850 --> 02:15:41,350
I'm looking.

3568
02:15:51,370 --> 02:15:52,810
Yeah, the stairs over here.

3569
02:15:52,930 --> 02:15:53,790
Oh, okay, okay.

3570
02:15:53,790 --> 02:15:54,490
Oh, I'm up.

3571
02:15:54,950 --> 02:15:55,190
Okay.

3572
02:15:55,190 --> 02:15:56,050
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.

3573
02:15:56,430 --> 02:15:57,610
That's right, that's right, that's right.

3574
02:15:57,970 --> 02:15:58,490
Oh, man.

3575
02:16:00,270 --> 02:16:00,370
Okay.

3576
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,020
You're looking at him, I'm looking at him.

3577
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:12,380
You're looking?

3578
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:14,360
Okay, uh, okay.

3579
02:16:14,680 --> 02:16:16,720
It's, uh, it's right over here.

3580
02:16:16,820 --> 02:16:17,340
It's over here.

3581
02:16:18,020 --> 02:16:18,760
Oh, I think.

3582
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:19,680
I think it's this one.

3583
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:21,120
There's another door over here.

3584
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:23,320
Oh, wait, I don't know which one it is then.

3585
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:24,200
Hey!

3586
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:24,760
I'm looking!

3587
02:16:24,980 --> 02:16:25,180
I'm looking!

3588
02:16:25,300 --> 02:16:25,540
Hey!

3589
02:16:25,740 --> 02:16:26,220
You cheater!

3590
02:16:26,540 --> 02:16:27,080
You are cheater!

3591
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:28,520
I'm looking at you!

3592
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:31,860
You can't do that!

3593
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:33,800
There's a door over here!

3594
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:34,620
Which door is it?

3595
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:35,560
Which one is it?

3596
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:36,580
Here, over here!

3597
02:16:36,660 --> 02:16:37,220
Oh, okay.

3598
02:16:37,820 --> 02:16:38,660
Okay, let's go this way.

3599
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:39,300
The egg, sleep.

3600
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:40,400
I'm looking at him.

3601
02:16:41,440 --> 02:16:42,620
I'm looking at you!

3602
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:44,500
Yeah, he's a big old cheater.

3603
02:16:45,660 --> 02:16:46,140
Mm-hmm.

3604
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:46,980
Ah!

3605
02:16:50,590 --> 02:16:51,030
Ah!

3606
02:17:14,270 --> 02:17:15,610
Oh my god.

3607
02:17:16,170 --> 02:17:16,670
No!

3608
02:17:17,190 --> 02:17:17,890
Oh, it's fine.

3609
02:17:18,210 --> 02:17:19,370
We were dead anyway.

3610
02:17:19,870 --> 02:17:20,970
Yeah, it's okay.

3611
02:17:22,770 --> 02:17:23,890
Oh boy.

3612
02:17:24,810 --> 02:17:27,710
Do we wanna just go to another moon instead?

3613
02:17:27,990 --> 02:17:28,250
We're getting tired.

3614
02:17:29,190 --> 02:17:33,610
Yeah, maybe a more challenging moon for higher value?

3615
02:17:33,950 --> 02:17:35,810
I don't think, well, we're gonna die.

3616
02:17:36,130 --> 02:17:38,970
We don't have enough money to do a challenging moon.

3617
02:17:39,590 --> 02:17:40,410
Yeah, true.

3618
02:17:40,830 --> 02:17:41,330
We're broke.

3619
02:17:41,530 --> 02:17:43,090
Yeah, wait, what's Rend?

3620
02:17:43,910 --> 02:17:44,410
Yeah.

3621
02:17:47,710 --> 02:17:48,210
Um...

3622
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:50,470
The way we all died there.

3623
02:17:50,810 --> 02:17:51,810
So funny.

3624
02:17:52,490 --> 02:17:54,090
Wait, Naki, how did you die?

3625
02:17:55,290 --> 02:17:55,670
Ooh!

3626
02:17:56,430 --> 02:17:58,250
You're going to so fancy, man.

3627
02:17:58,790 --> 02:18:00,270
There's no coil head there.

3628
02:18:01,290 --> 02:18:01,930
Oh wait, you died?

3629
02:18:02,410 --> 02:18:03,550
You died to the coil head?

3630
02:18:05,070 --> 02:18:05,850
Not as well.

3631
02:18:06,210 --> 02:18:06,630
Oh no.

3632
02:18:07,150 --> 02:18:09,770
I got separated and I was the one who met him.

3633
02:18:10,150 --> 02:18:12,770
But, um, couldn't get through him.

3634
02:18:12,930 --> 02:18:13,490
I don't even get...

3635
02:18:14,430 --> 02:18:15,310
What's M bringing?

3636
02:18:15,310 --> 02:18:15,870
Wow, so purple.

3637
02:18:18,030 --> 02:18:20,210
There's a free moons mod?

3638
02:18:20,470 --> 02:18:20,630
Really?

3639
02:18:21,490 --> 02:18:22,410
Free moons.

3640
02:18:23,090 --> 02:18:24,990
There's apparently a free moons mod.

3641
02:18:25,470 --> 02:18:25,810
Oh.

3642
02:18:26,830 --> 02:18:27,770
I didn't know that.

3643
02:18:27,850 --> 02:18:28,970
I didn't know that either.

3644
02:18:32,370 --> 02:18:33,410
Where should...

3645
02:18:33,410 --> 02:18:33,830
You know what?

3646
02:18:33,910 --> 02:18:36,190
Let's just go to experimentation.

3647
02:18:37,390 --> 02:18:37,650
Okay.

3648
02:18:37,890 --> 02:18:40,590
There was also a gambling mod I hesitated on adding.

3649
02:18:40,890 --> 02:18:41,710
Wait, what's that?

3650
02:18:42,290 --> 02:18:42,750
What?

3651
02:18:43,210 --> 02:18:49,890
You can like, on the last day, you can like take all your
items and if it's not enough, you could like try a hand at

3652
02:18:49,890 --> 02:18:54,830
gambling to see if you can make them worth more or something
or if you can earn more.

3653
02:18:55,250 --> 02:18:55,930
Yeah, that's cool.

3654
02:19:00,770 --> 02:19:01,870
All right, are we going?

3655
02:19:02,190 --> 02:19:03,190
Yep, let's just go.

3656
02:19:03,690 --> 02:19:06,710
We're not gonna live, but we can at least explore.

3657
02:19:07,310 --> 02:19:09,150
Oh, it says we have to go to the company.

3658
02:19:09,590 --> 02:19:09,950
What?

3659
02:19:10,090 --> 02:19:11,130
They changed it!

3660
02:19:11,350 --> 02:19:11,810
Oh, yeah.

3661
02:19:11,810 --> 02:19:13,530
Yeah, let me see.

3662
02:19:14,030 --> 02:19:15,410
Let me try it one more time.

3663
02:19:15,530 --> 02:19:17,310
We can hold it, I think.

3664
02:19:17,550 --> 02:19:18,830
Oh yeah, I just need to hold it.

3665
02:19:18,890 --> 02:19:20,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just hold it.

3666
02:19:22,030 --> 02:19:22,230
Yeah.

3667
02:19:23,410 --> 02:19:24,370
Okay, okay.

3668
02:19:25,010 --> 02:19:25,010
Nice.

3669
02:19:25,790 --> 02:19:28,250
We're not following your rules, company!

3670
02:19:29,190 --> 02:19:29,690
Yeah.

3671
02:19:30,690 --> 02:19:31,830
Yeah, company sucks.

3672
02:19:32,850 --> 02:19:34,250
Yeah, we're dead anyway.

3673
02:19:35,510 --> 02:19:37,570
We're dead men walking.

3674
02:19:39,030 --> 02:19:39,570
Woohoo!

3675
02:19:40,950 --> 02:19:41,450
Woohoo!

3676
02:19:41,810 --> 02:19:42,950
It is so purple.

3677
02:19:43,350 --> 02:19:44,370
We're rebelling.

3678
02:19:44,630 --> 02:19:45,830
Yeah, we're rebelling.

3679
02:19:46,930 --> 02:19:47,370
Yeah.

3680
02:19:48,690 --> 02:19:49,130
Pumpkins.

3681
02:19:49,230 --> 02:19:50,530
Overthrow the company.

3682
02:19:50,950 --> 02:19:51,390
Pumpkins.

3683
02:19:52,890 --> 02:19:53,330
Pumpkins.

3684
02:19:55,710 --> 02:19:56,150
Pumpkins.

3685
02:19:56,470 --> 02:19:57,190
It's over there.

3686
02:19:59,490 --> 02:20:02,090
Now I don't go to the mansion, but it costs a lot.

3687
02:20:02,110 --> 02:20:03,430
It does cost a lot.

3688
02:20:03,710 --> 02:20:05,890
I'm going to go through the fire escape here.

3689
02:20:06,210 --> 02:20:06,290
Okay.

3690
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:10,310
I think it's this way, yeah.

3691
02:20:10,530 --> 02:20:11,630
Yeah, it's up this.

3692
02:20:11,810 --> 02:20:13,330
Up the stairs!

3693
02:20:19,890 --> 02:20:21,810
I'm coming in!

3694
02:20:24,270 --> 02:20:24,790
Oh!

3695
02:20:28,650 --> 02:20:28,910
Hello?

3696
02:20:30,410 --> 02:20:31,490
Oh, there we go!

3697
02:20:32,510 --> 02:20:33,270
Oh my god.

3698
02:20:33,430 --> 02:20:34,210
Oh shoot, it's locked!

3699
02:20:34,410 --> 02:20:35,070
We can't go out.

3700
02:20:35,230 --> 02:20:36,090
There's a wedding ring!

3701
02:20:37,870 --> 02:20:38,570
I can grab it!

3702
02:20:39,190 --> 02:20:40,150
A wedding ring!

3703
02:20:57,130 --> 02:20:59,370
I guess we gotta leave though.

3704
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:04,530
Wow, that must be worth a lot.

3705
02:21:05,090 --> 02:21:06,370
I think it was like 80 something.

3706
02:21:07,610 --> 02:21:08,230
Oh my god.

3707
02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:10,430
The engagement ring is very expensive.

3708
02:21:10,830 --> 02:21:17,450
I will choose who to marry whoever gathers the most items.

3709
02:21:19,530 --> 02:21:21,730
It is a battle of survivors.

3710
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:24,870
She wants to marry to money for the purchase.

3711
02:21:27,690 --> 02:21:28,930
No, no, no.

3712
02:21:29,350 --> 02:21:30,610
It's- it's not money.

3713
02:21:30,830 --> 02:21:31,470
It's not the money.

3714
02:21:31,870 --> 02:21:33,390
It's the- Infinite money.

3715
02:21:34,170 --> 02:21:35,510
It's the- Oh.

3716
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:48,180
It's your sense of adventure.

3717
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:49,120
Come on.

3718
02:21:49,380 --> 02:21:50,080
I'll follow that.

3719
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:50,720
Oh!

3720
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:52,900
Oh, that scared me.

3721
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:53,500
What was that?

3722
02:21:53,900 --> 02:21:54,880
I have that already.

3723
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:55,840
It was just a door.

3724
02:21:56,480 --> 02:21:57,200
Oh, there's a gift box!

3725
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:57,800
Oh, there's a gift!

3726
02:21:58,020 --> 02:21:58,740
There's a gift box!

3727
02:21:59,020 --> 02:21:59,380
Gotcha!

3728
02:22:00,100 --> 02:22:00,100
Gotcha!

3729
02:22:00,300 --> 02:22:00,540
Gotcha!

3730
02:22:00,820 --> 02:22:01,140
Here.

3731
02:22:01,320 --> 02:22:02,060
There you go, Emily.

3732
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:02,540
Yay!

3733
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:04,860
I did the last one.

3734
02:22:05,080 --> 02:22:06,440
How do you open it?

3735
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:08,080
Just left click, I think.

3736
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:09,420
Yeah, you guys ready?

3737
02:22:09,880 --> 02:22:10,100
Yeah.

3738
02:22:17,100 --> 02:22:18,440
It's so good!

3739
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:30,640
Yeah, the radiation's been here.

3740
02:22:31,180 --> 02:22:31,960
Oh my gosh.

3741
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:35,560
It's okay.

3742
02:22:35,780 --> 02:22:37,160
A little radiation won't hurt.

3743
02:22:37,220 --> 02:22:39,060
Oh, there's another one.

3744
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:40,140
There's one more.

3745
02:22:40,480 --> 02:22:41,040
What, really?

3746
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:43,600
Oh, there's another door over here.

3747
02:22:44,360 --> 02:22:46,280
Oh my gosh, there's so many of them.

3748
02:22:47,020 --> 02:22:47,420
Yeah.

3749
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:50,840
Wait, this is the same area, right?

3750
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:51,480
Oh, this is the same.

3751
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:52,780
Yeah, we just went in a circle.

3752
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:54,760
Oh yeah, we just went around.

3753
02:22:56,180 --> 02:22:57,920
Wait, which way was it?

3754
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:58,380
This way?

3755
02:22:58,800 --> 02:22:58,940
Yeah.

3756
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:01,980
This way?

3757
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:03,240
Follow me?

3758
02:23:03,460 --> 02:23:04,040
That way?

3759
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:04,880
Follow me.

3760
02:23:05,580 --> 02:23:06,940
Did we go down?

3761
02:23:07,420 --> 02:23:07,680
No?

3762
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:08,540
I think so.

3763
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:09,680
Okay.

3764
02:23:09,860 --> 02:23:10,560
Oh, there's nothing here.

3765
02:23:10,720 --> 02:23:11,300
Nothing here.

3766
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:19,200
One, one, one.

3767
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:21,500
Okay.

3768
02:23:21,580 --> 02:23:22,160
There we go.

3769
02:23:22,620 --> 02:23:24,320
Okay, we've got...

3770
02:23:24,320 --> 02:23:24,900
Lost.

3771
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:29,740
What if we all drop it at the same time?

3772
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:30,320
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3773
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:30,920
You want to try?

3774
02:23:31,340 --> 02:23:31,660
Okay, okay.

3775
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:32,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3776
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:32,740
Count down, yeah.

3777
02:23:33,220 --> 02:23:33,420
Okay.

3778
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:36,700
Uh, three, uh, two, uh, one.

3779
02:23:37,580 --> 02:23:37,880
Oh.

3780
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:49,840
Got it?

3781
02:23:50,860 --> 02:23:51,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3782
02:23:52,400 --> 02:23:52,720
Alright.

3783
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:54,340
Okay.

3784
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:55,540
Bring it home.

3785
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:56,280
Let's go.

3786
02:23:56,440 --> 02:23:57,060
Bring it home.

3787
02:23:57,380 --> 02:23:57,880
Bring it home.

3788
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:00,120
Oh, shoot.

3789
02:24:00,380 --> 02:24:00,960
There's a bee?

3790
02:24:01,260 --> 02:24:02,000
No, those are good.

3791
02:24:02,260 --> 02:24:02,680
Those are fine.

3792
02:24:02,740 --> 02:24:04,320
I think those are fine.

3793
02:24:04,660 --> 02:24:04,860
Yeah.

3794
02:24:04,860 --> 02:24:06,400
Yeah, it should be fine.

3795
02:24:06,900 --> 02:24:11,640
Yeah, the bees only gather around the harmful bees gather
around the hive.

3796
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:13,000
Oh.

3797
02:24:13,860 --> 02:24:14,160
Yeah.

3798
02:24:14,580 --> 02:24:14,860
Alright.

3799
02:24:15,940 --> 02:24:16,440
Wow.

3800
02:24:21,420 --> 02:24:22,880
Ash and Middok is here.

3801
02:24:24,180 --> 02:24:25,940
Let's go see if we can find Goku.

3802
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:27,780
I'm gonna go.

3803
02:24:28,660 --> 02:24:29,560
I'm gonna go.

3804
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:31,480
I'm gonna find Goku.

3805
02:24:32,780 --> 02:24:33,640
Goku, where?

3806
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:37,920
Goku, where is he?

3807
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:40,300
Actually, that's what this wedding ring is for.

3808
02:24:40,540 --> 02:24:41,140
It's for him.

3809
02:24:42,320 --> 02:24:43,160
Oh, it's dark.

3810
02:24:45,640 --> 02:24:47,240
I know you're afraid of commitment!

3811
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:50,740
I know you have chichi, but what about Mimi?

3812
02:24:50,740 --> 02:25:00,090
I don't think that's Goku.

3813
02:25:03,810 --> 02:25:04,890
Where is him up?

3814
02:25:08,410 --> 02:25:09,570
I can't say I.

3815
02:25:09,970 --> 02:25:10,070
Oh.

3816
02:25:10,830 --> 02:25:11,790
Oh, hello?

3817
02:25:12,250 --> 02:25:12,670
Hi.

3818
02:25:12,810 --> 02:25:13,610
There's a thumper.

3819
02:25:14,350 --> 02:25:15,210
Oh, okay.

3820
02:25:15,290 --> 02:25:16,050
Oh, there she is.

3821
02:25:16,310 --> 02:25:16,690
Yeah.

3822
02:25:16,930 --> 02:25:18,490
I don't think we can go over there.

3823
02:25:19,730 --> 02:25:20,690
Um, why?

3824
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:22,770
Um.

3825
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:26,170
Um, um, I think, yeah.

3826
02:25:26,190 --> 02:25:27,370
Yeah, I think we should...

3827
02:25:31,180 --> 02:25:32,180
That was a close one.

3828
02:25:34,660 --> 02:25:35,220
It's...

3829
02:25:35,220 --> 02:25:37,120
He's probably gone.

3830
02:25:39,220 --> 02:25:41,480
Did you want to, like, propose to the author?

3831
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:43,540
I was trying to find Goku.

3832
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:46,200
Oh, Goku, Goku, sir.

3833
02:25:46,740 --> 02:25:47,200
Yeah.

3834
02:25:47,420 --> 02:25:47,880
The man in marriage.

3835
02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:48,820
It wasn't Goku?

3836
02:25:49,340 --> 02:25:49,800
No.

3837
02:25:50,340 --> 02:25:50,620
Yeah.

3838
02:25:51,320 --> 02:25:53,120
And the fabled Goku.

3839
02:25:57,740 --> 02:25:58,300
What?

3840
02:25:59,100 --> 02:25:59,660
What?

3841
02:25:59,660 --> 02:26:00,860
I think I let it.

3842
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:02,740
Oh my gosh.

3843
02:26:02,860 --> 02:26:04,060
The thumper's in the way.

3844
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:06,280
Yeah, we can't go any further.

3845
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:07,620
Man.

3846
02:26:09,860 --> 02:26:11,700
I thought you guys were going to die.

3847
02:26:12,480 --> 02:26:14,060
Can't believe he's blockiest from Goku.

3848
02:26:14,420 --> 02:26:14,840
You know what?

3849
02:26:15,820 --> 02:26:16,960
I'm, you know what?

3850
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:18,500
I, this guy is a jerk.

3851
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:19,840
I'm going to go teach him a lesson.

3852
02:26:20,580 --> 02:26:20,800
I.

3853
02:26:21,660 --> 02:26:22,280
Hey, you.

3854
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:25,100
Hey, get out of here.

3855
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:26,220
This is our...

3856
02:26:26,220 --> 02:26:29,000
Oh, I'm okay.

3857
02:26:29,960 --> 02:26:30,400
Yeah?

3858
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:31,400
Yeah, I'm actually...

3859
02:26:31,420 --> 02:26:32,100
I'm actually okay.

3860
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:35,760
I don't know where I am though.

3861
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:36,520
You

3862
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:42,980
good?

3863
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:01,210
Where are you?

3864
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:02,900
Oh.

3865
02:27:10,500 --> 02:27:12,660
No, everybody I'm hearing...

3866
02:27:12,660 --> 02:27:14,280
Oh god.

3867
02:27:15,720 --> 02:27:17,720
I was hearing more voice.

3868
02:27:18,260 --> 02:27:20,880
I was hearing the everybody from the dead.

3869
02:27:21,900 --> 02:27:22,860
That was not Goku.

3870
02:27:24,540 --> 02:27:25,640
That's just a disappointment.

3871
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:27,300
It's not Goku at all.

3872
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:29,680
It's just sad.

3873
02:27:32,860 --> 02:27:33,680
You're an imposter?

3874
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:35,340
Are you the real Ayla Sama?

3875
02:27:36,860 --> 02:27:37,340
Yes.

3876
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:38,660
You can quiz me.

3877
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:42,360
Only the real Ayla Sama would know the right answers.

3878
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:43,980
Right.

3879
02:27:46,470 --> 02:27:47,390
Ayla Sama cute.

3880
02:27:48,450 --> 02:27:49,430
Oh, wow.

3881
02:27:50,050 --> 02:27:50,330
Hello.

3882
02:27:50,410 --> 02:27:51,650
No, that's the imposter.

3883
02:27:51,690 --> 02:27:52,550
That's the imposter.

3884
02:27:53,050 --> 02:27:53,230
Me?

3885
02:27:53,470 --> 02:27:54,370

3886
02:27:54,390 --> 02:27:54,510
Me?

3887
02:27:54,930 --> 02:27:55,870
No, no, no.

3888
02:27:56,910 --> 02:27:57,690
It's her.

3889
02:27:57,890 --> 02:27:58,210
It's her.

3890
02:27:58,230 --> 02:28:09,510
It's her because she said oh, I'm gonna teach this monster a
lesson and then she died I didn't die everybody died Oh my

I hear something.

3894
02:28:37,190 --> 02:28:38,130
You did this!

3895
02:28:38,310 --> 02:28:39,170

Yeah.

3899
02:28:47,010 --> 02:28:47,570
Yeah.

3900
02:28:47,830 --> 02:28:49,090
I am the imposter.

3901
02:28:50,470 --> 02:28:52,030
I'm gonna take us all down.

3902
02:28:52,170 --> 02:28:53,370
I'm gonna take us all down.

3903
02:28:54,410 --> 02:28:54,570
Where?

3904
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:55,150
No!

3905
02:28:55,490 --> 02:28:56,770

3906
02:29:02,170 --> 02:29:02,610

uh-oh.

3908
02:29:06,970 --> 02:29:08,610
You're not gonna leave without me, right, guy?

3909
02:29:09,170 --> 02:29:09,870
That'd be crazy.

3910
02:29:10,150 --> 02:29:10,550
All right.

3911
02:29:11,030 --> 02:29:11,950
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3912
02:29:12,390 --> 02:29:13,310
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3913
02:29:13,630 --> 02:29:14,250
I can't open it.

3914
02:29:14,470 --> 02:29:15,550
I thought you were gonna go.

3915
02:29:16,230 --> 02:29:16,450
Yeah.

3916
02:29:17,230 --> 02:29:17,790
Yeah, yeah.

3917
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:21,280
I...

3918
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:21,680
All right.

3919
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:22,760
You gotta shake it.

3920
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:25,000
You think Emily is gonna come back anytime soon?

3921
02:29:25,640 --> 02:29:26,080
Or...

3922
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:26,780
Oh, she's dead.

3923
02:29:26,920 --> 02:29:27,560
I saw it.

3924
02:29:28,980 --> 02:29:30,060
I think we should leave.

3925
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:31,680
I think we should leave.

3926
02:29:31,800 --> 02:29:34,140
I'm gonna teach this guy a lesson.

3927
02:29:45,880 --> 02:29:47,700
What is happening?

3928
02:29:49,480 --> 02:29:51,220
Hello, welcome to the dead.

3929
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:54,160
Hello, I've been here the whole time.

3930
02:29:56,620 --> 02:29:59,080
Oh my gosh, they didn't believe you that I died.

3931
02:30:00,260 --> 02:30:01,280
They left.

3932
02:30:03,140 --> 02:30:04,740
And now we're all gonna die together.

3933
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:05,720
You are paranoid!

3934
02:30:06,100 --> 02:30:07,680
You're gaslighting us!

3935
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:10,120
I can't really lie so blatantly.

3936
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:14,400
We owe a dollar.

3937
02:30:15,400 --> 02:30:16,580
We owe one money.

3938
02:30:17,740 --> 02:30:18,180
Here we go.

3939
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:19,560
Time to die!

3940
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:22,340
Let's die!

3941
02:30:22,820 --> 02:30:23,560
Let's die!

3942
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:27,320
They can't catch me over here.

3943
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:27,440
They can't catch me over here.

3944
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:31,000
You should use the wedding ring!

3945
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:31,760
Use the ring!

3946
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:42,360
One money.

3947
02:30:43,300 --> 02:30:44,440
One single money.

3948
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:47,600
Oh, seven, everybody.

3949
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:49,160
The maid brigade?

3950
02:30:49,460 --> 02:30:49,740
I'm fired.

3951
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:50,960
Hello.

3952
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:55,220
Oh, we're back to our normal suit.

3953
02:30:55,940 --> 02:30:56,220
Yay!

3954
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:58,220
I mean, I am changing.

3955
02:30:58,940 --> 02:30:59,320
Boo, yeah.

3956
02:31:00,840 --> 02:31:01,320
Vigi.

3957
02:31:01,940 --> 02:31:02,520
Big bush.

3958
02:31:06,060 --> 02:31:08,720
Well, I feel like I've met you guys before.

3959
02:31:09,740 --> 02:31:10,940
Is it deja vu?

3960
02:31:11,020 --> 02:31:11,660
Deja vu.

3961
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:12,660
Oh, yeah.

3962
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:13,780
Maybe Mario.

3963
02:31:14,260 --> 02:31:15,860
I've never met you guys before.

3964
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:16,780
Mama Mia.

3965
02:31:17,820 --> 02:31:18,260
Brother.

3966
02:31:19,540 --> 02:31:22,640
I've never met you before in my life, except you, my
brother.

3967
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:24,420
She didn't remember us.

3968
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:25,400
She's so sad.

3969
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:29,100
You should know her, but you're both Nintendo.

3970
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:31,060
Yeah, I was going to say, you look pretty familiar.

3971
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:33,740
Are you the real, are you my real brother?

3972
02:31:35,020 --> 02:31:35,420
Oh!

3973
02:31:42,460 --> 02:31:43,820
Can't believe it's a real Mario!

3974
02:31:44,500 --> 02:31:45,480
It's a long-lost reunion!

3975
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:47,500
Not gonna lie, I thought you were my princess Peach.

3976
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:48,560
Mmmmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

3977
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:49,520
Oh, happy to be you.

3978
02:31:49,620 --> 02:31:49,900
Cheers!

3979
02:31:50,680 --> 02:31:51,260
Yes, yes!

3980
02:31:51,260 --> 02:31:54,500
I mean, I mean, Wario.

3981
02:31:54,620 --> 02:31:54,780
I mean, Wario.

3982
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:55,340
I thought you were Wario.

3983
02:31:55,800 --> 02:31:56,400
I thought Wario!

3984
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:57,700
I've become such a Rizzler.

3985
02:32:01,400 --> 02:32:02,820
My God, it is sauce.

3986
02:32:02,900 --> 02:32:04,040
Red is sauce, yeah.

3987
02:32:04,960 --> 02:32:08,100
Yeah, red is sus, red is sus.

3988
02:32:08,360 --> 02:32:11,440
No, this is, I'm Mario with a...

3989
02:32:11,440 --> 02:32:13,400
Oh, brother, I think you changed a little.

3990
02:32:13,400 --> 02:32:14,420
Yeah, I've changed.

3991
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:17,100
I'm Mario from actual New York.

3992
02:32:17,300 --> 02:32:17,880
I'm from Mario.

3993
02:32:21,300 --> 02:32:21,900
Brooklyn.

3994
02:32:25,480 --> 02:32:27,000
So Brooklyn, does you?

3995
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:30,120
Yeah, that's been a hard life.

3996
02:32:32,440 --> 02:32:33,800
Mario with attitude.

3997
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:36,760
Let's see.

3998
02:32:37,900 --> 02:32:40,140
You guys want to try to get the mansion?

3999
02:32:40,620 --> 02:32:43,580
Yeah, let's play, like, serious, and we'll try to get the
mansion.

4000
02:32:43,920 --> 02:32:45,840
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay, let's try to get the mansion.

4001
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:48,260
I don't know what the numbers mean.

4002
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:49,880
We've never been in here.

4003
02:32:50,440 --> 02:32:53,460
We can go to March, again, we can try.

4004
02:32:54,320 --> 02:32:54,760
Ooh.

4005
02:32:55,240 --> 02:32:55,560
Yeah.

4006
02:32:56,400 --> 02:32:57,280
Oh, okay.

4007
02:32:57,540 --> 02:32:58,080
Oh, okay.

4008
02:32:58,080 --> 02:32:59,260
Sorry, I confirmed.

4009
02:33:00,620 --> 02:33:02,140
Yeah, just audio glitches.

4010
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:03,120
Let's do this.

4011
02:33:03,560 --> 02:33:04,900
Let's do this for real.

4012
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:06,660
Oh, constant rain.

4013
02:33:06,880 --> 02:33:07,380
It's raining.

4014
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:08,440
Oh, no, wait.

4015
02:33:08,660 --> 02:33:09,720
It didn't say it was raining.

4016
02:33:10,700 --> 02:33:12,400
It says constant rain.

4017
02:33:13,060 --> 02:33:13,260
Uh-oh.

4018
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:14,720
Oh, there we go.

4019
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:16,180
Still have to.

4020
02:33:16,180 --> 02:33:16,560
Oh, no.

4021
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:18,120
Can we change it, right?

4022
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:18,980
Can we change it?

4023
02:33:18,980 --> 02:33:21,160
The raining has lightning strike, right?

4024
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:22,220
Yeah, I think so.

4025
02:33:23,120 --> 02:33:24,100
Yeah, I didn't say.

4026
02:33:24,520 --> 02:33:24,760
The numbers.

4027
02:33:24,920 --> 02:33:25,520
What do they mean?

4028
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:25,860
Try.

4029
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:30,360
There's Rend, Dine, and Titan.

4030
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:30,960
Right.

4031
02:33:31,160 --> 02:33:32,980
Those are the ones that we can't afford.

4032
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:34,580
Oh, we can't afford them.

4033
02:33:34,600 --> 02:33:34,940
Yeah, they're like.

4034
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:50,920
like 600 what no it is maybe experimentation is pretty easy
yeah I think I think we'll go with the classic yeah okay oh

4035
02:33:50,920 --> 02:34:00,200
my gosh you turn off the lights okay oh someone said that's
just flavor text not the weather really so it's not actually

4036
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:06,900
really oh really oh okay let's just go to it Yeah, that
might be just a description.

4037
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:07,160
Can you tell the truth?

4038
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:08,680
Are they gaslighting?

4039
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:10,400
Oh, wait, are they gaslighting us?

4040
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:11,840
I can't tell, actually!

4041
02:34:12,320 --> 02:34:13,820
I don't feel like I trust.

4042
02:34:14,440 --> 02:34:15,140
That's true.

4043
02:34:15,820 --> 02:34:17,300
Now to go to Luigi's Mansion!

4044
02:34:17,740 --> 02:34:19,260
We gotta go there eventually.

4045
02:34:20,100 --> 02:34:22,140
Yeah, we have to get money to go there.

4046
02:34:22,580 --> 02:34:23,020
Wahoo!

4047
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:26,280
Okay.

4048
02:34:27,720 --> 02:34:29,400
Only if it says it on the list.

4049
02:34:29,560 --> 02:34:34,820
Yeah, but one time it didn't say Eclipse and it was actually
Eclipse.

4050
02:34:36,560 --> 02:34:38,340
Yeah, that's true.

4051
02:34:38,960 --> 02:34:39,760
We can try it.

4052
02:34:40,220 --> 02:34:41,580
We'll learn something now.

4053
02:34:41,580 --> 02:34:42,680
Oh, Luigi time.

4054
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:43,940
Okay.

4055
02:34:45,140 --> 02:34:45,780
Okay.

4056
02:34:46,740 --> 02:34:47,540
Here we go.

4057
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:49,640
I'm a Luigi number one.

4058
02:34:51,380 --> 02:34:54,520
I think I like being Mario now.

4059
02:34:56,760 --> 02:34:58,120
I'm a Luigi.

4060
02:34:58,500 --> 02:34:59,320
Number one.

4061
02:34:59,520 --> 02:34:59,780
Number.

4062
02:35:02,930 --> 02:35:05,070
Oh, yeah, it is fine.

4063
02:35:05,890 --> 02:35:06,870
Yeah, yeah, it looks okay.

4064
02:35:07,170 --> 02:35:07,310
Yeah.

4065
02:35:27,770 --> 02:35:29,090
We made it!

4066
02:35:34,040 --> 02:35:34,900
Got something.

4067
02:35:35,140 --> 02:35:36,380
Got something immediately.

4068
02:35:37,400 --> 02:35:37,460
Yeah.

4069
02:35:38,360 --> 02:35:39,160
It's right there.

4070
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:39,520
You know what?

4071
02:35:39,980 --> 02:35:40,940
I'm just gonna leave it outside.

4072
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:43,540
There we go.

4073
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:45,260
Run me.

4074
02:35:45,620 --> 02:35:46,820
It's really dark.

4075
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:49,380
It's really dark.

4076
02:35:49,640 --> 02:35:50,740
I'm with you.

4077
02:35:51,180 --> 02:35:52,180
Oh, okay.

4078
02:35:52,180 --> 02:35:52,840
I'm behind you.

4079
02:35:52,860 --> 02:35:53,340
Oh, that's a dead end.

4080
02:35:53,900 --> 02:35:54,300
Dead end.

4081
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:56,000
Turn around.

4082
02:35:56,340 --> 02:35:56,720
What's that?

4083
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:00,040
Oh, it's a me.

4084
02:36:00,280 --> 02:36:00,660
It's a me.

4085
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:01,540
The leader.

4086
02:36:02,020 --> 02:36:03,260
Oh, it's a dead end.

4087
02:36:03,500 --> 02:36:04,260
Oh, mama mia.

4088
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:07,560
Mama mia.

4089
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:08,580
Oh.

4090
02:36:15,210 --> 02:36:17,510
I think I'm gonna get lost in here, brother.

4091
02:36:18,390 --> 02:36:18,750
Yeah.

4092
02:36:19,050 --> 02:36:19,930
Oh, there's another...

4093
02:36:19,930 --> 02:36:20,930
Yeah, there's a door over here.

4094
02:36:20,950 --> 02:36:21,310
What's that?

4095
02:36:21,610 --> 02:36:22,210
Oh, it's lit up.

4096
02:36:22,410 --> 02:36:23,430
Something glowing over there.

4097
02:36:24,130 --> 02:36:24,790
Oh, it's a...

4098
02:36:24,790 --> 02:36:25,390
Oh, there's a key.

4099
02:36:25,590 --> 02:36:25,910
There's a key.

4100
02:36:26,090 --> 02:36:26,570
There's a key.

4101
02:36:27,490 --> 02:36:28,230
I got an engine.

4102
02:36:28,990 --> 02:36:29,450
Got it?

4103
02:36:30,210 --> 02:36:30,590
Oh, not.

4104
02:36:30,630 --> 02:36:32,070
I can make this...

4105
02:36:32,070 --> 02:36:32,690
There's a key over there.

4106
02:36:32,710 --> 02:36:33,350
Don't, maybe.

4107
02:36:33,550 --> 02:36:34,090
I think you can.

4108
02:36:34,170 --> 02:36:35,190
I think you can do it, brother.

4109
02:36:35,850 --> 02:36:36,450
I believe in you.

4110
02:36:36,610 --> 02:36:36,790
Okay.

4111
02:36:37,930 --> 02:36:38,130
Okay.

4112
02:36:38,130 --> 02:36:40,170
Mama Luigi, number one!

4113
02:36:48,760 --> 02:36:49,220
There's shit.

4114
02:36:49,760 --> 02:36:52,660
There should be a platform.

4115
02:36:53,180 --> 02:36:54,060
Oh, there we go.

4116
02:36:54,300 --> 02:36:55,280
It's over here.

4117
02:36:55,380 --> 02:36:57,340
Oh, there you go.

4118
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:00,960
She did it.

4119
02:37:02,560 --> 02:37:04,500
Can you get to the door over there, too?

4120
02:37:06,100 --> 02:37:06,480
Yeah.

4121
02:37:07,660 --> 02:37:09,220
Is there anything in there?

4122
02:37:10,780 --> 02:37:12,080
It's the same maze.

4123
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:13,660
Oh, it's another maze.

4124
02:37:14,760 --> 02:37:16,720
Yeah, it might be connected to the other room.

4125
02:37:16,940 --> 02:37:17,580
Do you want me to...

4126
02:37:17,580 --> 02:37:18,300

All that cardboard for nothing, I guess we gotta go back.

02:38:00,440 --> 02:38:01,400
Be careful!

4132
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:03,040
Very good.

4133
02:38:03,860 --> 02:38:05,220
Wait, did we go here or there?

4134
02:38:05,560 --> 02:38:07,480
Uh, we haven't gone this way.

4135
02:38:08,460 --> 02:38:09,360
We can check it out.

4136
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:12,060
What's that noise over here?

4137
02:38:12,280 --> 02:38:13,160
What does that sound?

4138
02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:13,740
Oh!

4139
02:38:14,100 --> 02:38:14,260
Oh!

4140
02:38:18,220 --> 02:38:20,980
If we pass through there, it'll- Oh!

02:38:20,980 --> 02:38:21,740

Yeah!

4147
02:39:02,240 --> 02:39:04,720
We said we were gonna play for real.

4148
02:39:05,260 --> 02:39:08,180
What is that?

4149
02:39:10,240 --> 02:39:10,900
The...

4150
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:11,840
Oh, it's just a thing.

4151
02:39:12,100 --> 02:39:12,560
A mantacle.

4152
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:31,240
Ayla Sama!

4153
02:39:35,170 --> 02:39:36,410
How was she already?

4154
02:39:36,750 --> 02:39:38,290
How was she already dead?

4155
02:39:42,810 --> 02:39:45,190
I think we should just go home.

4156
02:39:47,730 --> 02:39:48,090
No?

4157
02:39:48,570 --> 02:39:49,590
I think they're dead.

4158
02:39:50,330 --> 02:39:51,170
They are dead.

4159
02:39:51,310 --> 02:39:54,010
I think we should just go.

4160
02:39:55,870 --> 02:39:57,210
We almost start the ship.

4161
02:39:58,170 --> 02:40:00,390
Yeah, I think we should just leave.

4162
02:40:00,770 --> 02:40:01,970
I think it's fine.

4163
02:40:02,510 --> 02:40:04,430
Does Emily fail a parkour?

4164
02:40:05,730 --> 02:40:07,870
Yeah, that's what happened.

4165
02:40:10,270 --> 02:40:12,410
Yeah, that's okay.

4166
02:40:13,150 --> 02:40:15,070
I'm ashamed to be the brother anymore.

4167
02:40:18,690 --> 02:40:21,890
I thought Luigi was supposed to be glad jumping.

4168
02:40:22,410 --> 02:40:25,490
It means your camera shakes the most when you're paranoid.

4169
02:40:25,670 --> 02:40:27,650
You're like, like shaking the camera.

4170
02:40:28,330 --> 02:40:29,210
Oh, really?

4171
02:40:29,990 --> 02:40:30,970
Yeah, I think so.

4172
02:40:32,970 --> 02:40:34,090
Big bro.

4173
02:40:35,210 --> 02:40:36,190
Where did a big bro go?

4174
02:40:36,390 --> 02:40:37,410
He abandoned me.

4175
02:40:37,490 --> 02:40:38,690
I'm big boss now.

4176
02:40:40,190 --> 02:40:40,990
I don't know.

4177
02:40:41,290 --> 02:40:43,070
He just acknowledged I'm the better brother.

4178
02:40:43,130 --> 02:40:46,390
I didn't want to be- I didn't want to be related to you any
longer.

4179
02:40:46,830 --> 02:40:47,550
I'm ashamed.

4180
02:40:48,190 --> 02:40:50,090
Wait, are you- are you knuckles?

4181
02:40:50,370 --> 02:40:51,670
Is that- are you knuckles?

4182
02:40:52,010 --> 02:40:52,490
I'm knuckles.

4183
02:40:53,550 --> 02:40:55,910
Oh my god, there is knuckles in here.

4184
02:40:56,170 --> 02:40:56,770
Yeah, yeah.

4185
02:40:57,370 --> 02:40:58,590
What does it look like?

4186
02:40:58,610 --> 02:40:59,230
She's wearing a mask.

4187
02:40:59,310 --> 02:41:00,310
What is Slayer?

4188
02:41:01,610 --> 02:41:02,650
What is Slayer?

4189
02:41:02,730 --> 02:41:03,750
What do I look like?

4190
02:41:05,330 --> 02:41:06,050
Oh, mom.

4191
02:41:06,250 --> 02:41:07,030
What is that?

4192
02:41:07,270 --> 02:41:09,670
It's like a green and black suit.

4193
02:41:10,050 --> 02:41:10,170
Yeah.

4194
02:41:10,190 --> 02:41:12,350
You have a mountain duo behind you.

4195
02:41:12,350 --> 02:41:12,690
Oh, I do?

4196
02:41:12,850 --> 02:41:13,210
I'm a gamer?

4197
02:41:13,570 --> 02:41:14,370
Yeah, you do.

4198
02:41:14,550 --> 02:41:15,130
Yeah, you do.

4199
02:41:15,210 --> 02:41:17,730
Red mountain duo.

4200
02:41:18,130 --> 02:41:18,950
Now you have an eyeball.

4201
02:41:19,790 --> 02:41:21,430
Oh, banana.

4202
02:41:22,530 --> 02:41:22,590
Banana.

4203
02:41:23,350 --> 02:41:23,790
Banana.

4204
02:41:26,750 --> 02:41:27,990
Well, I'm Doom guy?

4205
02:41:28,010 --> 02:41:29,070
I have a yellow sign.

4206
02:41:29,210 --> 02:41:30,170
I think it suits you.

4207
02:41:30,910 --> 02:41:31,570
The yellow?

4208
02:41:32,910 --> 02:41:33,790
Yeah, the yellow.

4209
02:41:33,870 --> 02:41:34,250
It's okay.

4210
02:41:34,310 --> 02:41:36,190
Now that Mario's gone, I'm the best brother.

4211
02:41:36,410 --> 02:41:36,830
It's okay.

4212
02:41:36,930 --> 02:41:38,510
It's all according to Luigi's plan.

4213
02:41:39,010 --> 02:41:39,310
Yeah.

4214
02:41:39,510 --> 02:41:40,170

Zero death speed run any person.

Oh my god.

4232
02:43:01,490 --> 02:43:03,270
I can't, I have it in my blood.

4233
02:43:03,490 --> 02:43:05,350
I'm not Mario anymore, but I can't stop Yahoo!

4234
02:43:07,410 --> 02:43:08,530
It's in my genes.

4235
02:43:08,810 --> 02:43:09,490
It's in my DNA.

4236
02:43:09,510 --> 02:43:10,870
It's like Yahoo!

4237
02:43:14,110 --> 02:43:18,230
I want to keep saying Yahoo so the skin walker will say it.

4238
02:43:18,390 --> 02:43:18,870
Yahoo!

4239
02:43:20,110 --> 02:43:20,590
Yahoo!

4240
02:43:21,670 --> 02:43:21,670
Yahoo!

4241
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:27,680
It's Yoshi.

4242
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:28,520
Oh, nice!

4243
02:43:28,940 --> 02:43:29,320
Yoshi!

4244
02:43:30,500 --> 02:43:30,980
Wow!

4245
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:35,140
Let's see what's down here.

4246
02:43:36,560 --> 02:43:37,360
I think it's a dead end.

4247
02:43:37,500 --> 02:43:38,460
Oh, no, never mind.

4248
02:43:38,860 --> 02:43:39,720
No, there's more.

4249
02:43:39,800 --> 02:43:40,440
Oh, there's a key.

4250
02:43:41,240 --> 02:43:41,560
Nice.

4251
02:43:42,100 --> 02:43:43,980
Oh, it's the light thing.

4252
02:43:45,380 --> 02:43:46,500
It's the apparatus.

4253
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:46,940
Yeah.

4254
02:43:48,480 --> 02:43:48,920
Oh.

4255
02:43:50,340 --> 02:43:50,780
Money.

4256
02:43:52,740 --> 02:43:53,980
I can't grab this bottle.

4257
02:43:54,200 --> 02:43:54,620
What the heck?

4258
02:43:54,900 --> 02:43:55,280
I know.

4259
02:43:55,720 --> 02:43:56,920
Why is it...

4260
02:44:00,520 --> 02:44:02,260
Should I get the apparatus?

4261
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:03,520
Oh, we can wait.

4262
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:05,960
We can have the...

4263
02:44:05,960 --> 02:44:08,420
Yeah, it's too foreign.

4264
02:44:09,640 --> 02:44:11,220
Oh, it's just a loop, I think.

4265
02:44:11,340 --> 02:44:11,480
Wait.

4266
02:44:11,660 --> 02:44:12,660
This is where we came from, right?

4267
02:44:13,340 --> 02:44:14,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4268
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:14,800
I think so.

4269
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:16,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4270
02:44:19,020 --> 02:44:20,960
I'm gonna leave this outside.

4271
02:44:21,140 --> 02:44:21,700
I'll come back.

4272
02:44:21,780 --> 02:44:22,060
Yep.

4273
02:44:26,500 --> 02:44:28,960
Did you hear me drop it from out there?

4274
02:44:30,140 --> 02:44:31,440
I didn't hear it.

4275
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:34,300
I don't think it goes through the door.

4276
02:44:34,420 --> 02:44:35,060
Oh, there's a metal sheet.

4277
02:44:35,720 --> 02:44:36,220
I got it.

4278
02:44:36,300 --> 02:44:36,560
Where?

4279
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:37,860
I got a sheet.

4280
02:44:38,080 --> 02:44:38,800
Which way did you go?

4281
02:44:39,140 --> 02:44:41,360
I went downstairs, but I think it's a dead end.

4282
02:44:42,040 --> 02:44:42,680
Oh, no, no, there's more.

4283
02:44:42,760 --> 02:44:43,620
There's more, there's more here.

4284
02:44:43,900 --> 02:44:44,380
There's more?

4285
02:44:44,660 --> 02:44:44,920
Okay.

4286
02:44:45,180 --> 02:44:46,200
Yeah, come on.

4287
02:44:46,360 --> 02:44:46,780
Brivar.

4288
02:44:47,140 --> 02:44:47,520
I want.

4289
02:44:47,980 --> 02:44:48,060
Yahoo!

4290
02:44:51,960 --> 02:44:53,280
Oh, there's another metal sheet.

4291
02:44:54,140 --> 02:44:55,100
Oh nice!

4292
02:44:56,040 --> 02:44:56,520
Yahoo!

4293
02:44:57,120 --> 02:44:59,320
I do have a key in case there's anything lost.

4294
02:44:59,460 --> 02:45:01,340
Oh, watch out, watch out.

4295
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:03,080
I don't know.

4296
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:03,920
I heard it.

4297
02:45:04,300 --> 02:45:04,920
I don't know where.

4298
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:06,960
Where is it?

4299
02:45:07,860 --> 02:45:09,520
Also the fire that's here, we can leave.

4300
02:45:09,900 --> 02:45:11,880
Yeah, but where's the mine?

4301
02:45:14,680 --> 02:45:16,180
Maybe on a ceiling?

4302
02:45:17,140 --> 02:45:17,980
Can it be on a ceiling?

4303
02:45:19,380 --> 02:45:20,080
I don't know.

4304
02:45:20,400 --> 02:45:21,260
Where is it?

4305
02:45:22,140 --> 02:45:23,040
Oh god.

4306
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:23,760

02:46:02,330 --> 02:46:03,250
And we can go.

4311
02:46:05,170 --> 02:46:05,530
Wait.

4312
02:46:06,090 --> 02:46:07,370
I don't know how to get back.

4313
02:46:07,810 --> 02:46:09,550
I don't know how to get there from here.

4314
02:46:10,170 --> 02:46:11,110
We can figure it out.

4315
02:46:11,290 --> 02:46:11,590
Oh, behind.

4316
02:46:11,670 --> 02:46:12,090
Watch out.

4317
02:46:12,290 --> 02:46:12,630
Watch out.

4318
02:46:13,330 --> 02:46:14,070
Is it this way?

4319
02:46:15,770 --> 02:46:16,610
Oh, are you going straight?

4320
02:46:17,430 --> 02:46:18,270
Wait, which way?

02:46:18,390 --> 02:46:18,790

4323
02:46:19,810 --> 02:46:22,950
I feel like if we go get the high ground, right, we can see.

4324
02:46:23,050 --> 02:46:24,590

Okay, okay.

Wait, I...

02:46:58,830 --> 02:46:59,770

Oh, okay.

4333
02:47:00,710 --> 02:47:01,350
We're close then.

4334
02:47:01,390 --> 02:47:02,590
We can get from the main entrance.

4335
02:47:03,310 --> 02:47:04,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4336
02:47:04,170 --> 02:47:04,570
Yeah.

4337
02:47:05,330 --> 02:47:06,750
We're not lost.

4338
02:47:07,310 --> 02:47:09,370
Oh, there's a large axle that you got.

4339
02:47:10,070 --> 02:47:11,070
Oh, I can grab it.

4340
02:47:11,150 --> 02:47:11,770
I can grab it.

4341
02:47:12,150 --> 02:47:12,730
Okay, take me.

4342
02:47:12,950 --> 02:47:13,650
Go for it.

4343
02:47:13,690 --> 02:47:13,970
Okay.

4344
02:47:14,570 --> 02:47:14,810
All right.

4345
02:47:14,850 --> 02:47:15,250
Yeah.

4346
02:47:15,450 --> 02:47:16,250
Let's go.

4347
02:47:16,890 --> 02:47:17,290
Oh, my God.

4348
02:47:17,350 --> 02:47:18,190
Gaming, gaming.

4349
02:47:19,730 --> 02:47:20,730
Finally, I'm not there.

4350
02:47:23,170 --> 02:47:25,290
You're playing the game for real.

4351
02:47:25,590 --> 02:47:26,810
Yeah, I'm fine.

4352
02:47:27,710 --> 02:47:28,310
Okay.

4353
02:47:28,790 --> 02:47:29,410
And it's good.

4354
02:47:29,630 --> 02:47:30,410
It's still early.

4355
02:47:31,510 --> 02:47:33,030
Yeah, we should be fine.

4356
02:47:33,190 --> 02:47:33,990
We should be good.

4357
02:47:34,410 --> 02:47:36,450
I think Nucky and I live in there.

4358
02:47:36,910 --> 02:47:37,590
Where are you going?

4359
02:47:38,670 --> 02:47:39,510
I went the wrong way.

4360
02:47:39,710 --> 02:47:40,170
I'm okay.

4361
02:47:44,110 --> 02:47:45,830
I went the wrong turn.

4362
02:47:47,390 --> 02:47:47,890
Okay.

4363
02:47:48,870 --> 02:47:49,170
Nice.

4364
02:47:52,230 --> 02:47:53,670
I'll just forget about that.

4365
02:47:55,110 --> 02:47:56,270
Nice, guys.

4366
02:47:56,270 --> 02:47:57,910
Oh wow, we have a lot of money, yeah.

4367
02:48:00,930 --> 02:48:01,490
253.

4368
02:48:04,850 --> 02:48:05,410
No.

4369
02:48:06,170 --> 02:48:06,630
Another moon?

4370
02:48:06,950 --> 02:48:08,770
No, not the bigger ones, no.

4371
02:48:10,050 --> 02:48:12,770
I need more money.

4372
02:48:13,870 --> 02:48:14,570
Should we go back?

4373
02:48:14,810 --> 02:48:16,510
Let me check the camera.

4374
02:48:16,970 --> 02:48:17,970
Yeah, see how they're doing.

4375
02:48:19,050 --> 02:48:19,470
Yeah, yeah.

4376
02:48:21,630 --> 02:48:23,250
Uh, she's not moving.

4377
02:48:23,450 --> 02:48:25,630
What's the little green thing on?

4378
02:48:26,350 --> 02:48:27,410
Isn't that a loop?

4379
02:48:27,670 --> 02:48:28,390
What about Naki?

4380
02:48:29,390 --> 02:48:30,070
Oh, Naki's coming!

4381
02:48:30,270 --> 02:48:30,850
Naki's moving!

4382
02:48:31,110 --> 02:48:31,890
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

4383
02:48:32,710 --> 02:48:34,710
But she's getting- I think the green thing's just where
they're facing.

4384
02:48:34,910 --> 02:48:35,510
Wait, I don't know.

4385
02:48:35,550 --> 02:48:36,330
Oh, I can't tell.

4386
02:48:36,410 --> 02:48:37,030
It's not moving though.

4387
02:48:37,210 --> 02:48:37,830
I think she's dead.

4388
02:48:38,650 --> 02:48:39,390
Naki's coming.

4389
02:48:40,130 --> 02:48:40,530
Oh.

4390
02:48:41,230 --> 02:48:41,470
Hmm.

4391
02:48:42,490 --> 02:48:42,890
Ehh.

4392
02:48:44,110 --> 02:48:44,910
I hear...

4393
02:48:44,910 --> 02:48:45,590
I hear her.

4394
02:48:45,910 --> 02:48:46,310
Oh!

4395
02:48:46,310 --> 02:48:46,590
Ay, Ay!

4396
02:48:46,930 --> 02:48:54,750
I think she was with me.

4397
02:48:54,910 --> 02:48:55,550
I think she fell.

4398
02:48:55,750 --> 02:48:56,370
Oh, she fell.

4399
02:48:57,230 --> 02:48:57,370
Oh!

4400
02:48:57,470 --> 02:48:57,490
She fell.

4401
02:48:57,490 --> 02:48:58,010
Oh, she fell.

4402
02:48:58,130 --> 02:48:58,490
Oh.

4403
02:48:58,490 --> 02:48:59,270
No, she's not moving?

4404
02:48:59,450 --> 02:49:00,610
No, she's not moving.

4405
02:49:01,010 --> 02:49:01,790
She's just kind...

4406
02:49:01,790 --> 02:49:02,770
Yeah, I think she fell.

4407
02:49:02,970 --> 02:49:03,370
Lazy!

4408
02:49:03,770 --> 02:49:04,990
Lazy employee!

4409
02:49:05,250 --> 02:49:06,170
Lazy employee!

4410
02:49:07,870 --> 02:49:08,590
What are you doing?

4411
02:49:09,130 --> 02:49:10,050
Paranoid and lazy.

4412
02:49:10,490 --> 02:49:11,590
Paranoid and lazy.

4413
02:49:14,310 --> 02:49:14,770
Paranoid and lazy.

4414
02:49:14,770 --> 02:49:15,530
Whombo combo.

4415
02:49:15,550 --> 02:49:18,510
Ayla Sama, if you can hear this, this one's for you.

4416
02:49:20,470 --> 02:49:21,290
You heard us?

4417
02:49:21,610 --> 02:49:21,930
It sounds like a...

4418
02:49:21,930 --> 02:49:23,910
It sounds like an elephant or something.

4419
02:49:24,990 --> 02:49:25,290
No.

4420
02:49:26,390 --> 02:49:26,710
I'm Kai.

4421
02:49:26,710 --> 02:49:27,670
Oh, we're worried herself.

4422
02:49:27,890 --> 02:49:28,230
She died.

4423
02:49:28,490 --> 02:49:29,230
I guess we can go then.

4424
02:49:29,350 --> 02:49:29,690
Are we good?

4425
02:49:29,990 --> 02:49:30,130
Yeah.

4426
02:49:30,190 --> 02:49:31,010
Yeah, we got a lot.

4427
02:49:31,210 --> 02:49:31,870
We can go.

4428
02:49:32,090 --> 02:49:33,030
It's 5 p.m.

4429
02:49:33,030 --> 02:49:34,370
I think we should go.

4430
02:49:34,990 --> 02:49:35,430
Yeah, okay.

4431
02:49:36,190 --> 02:49:36,630
Go.

4432
02:49:38,370 --> 02:49:39,250
Let's go.

4433
02:49:43,420 --> 02:49:44,540
With my Ilosama.

4434
02:49:46,880 --> 02:49:47,580
Hello, Ilosama.

4435
02:49:47,860 --> 02:49:48,980
She was with me.

4436
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:49,780
Wait a minute.

4437
02:49:50,380 --> 02:49:52,600
She's still with us in spirit.

4438
02:49:54,780 --> 02:49:55,220
It's true.

4439
02:49:55,400 --> 02:49:58,280
She's probably hearing our voices now and watching the song
above.

4440
02:49:59,240 --> 02:50:00,340
Yeah, Ilosama.

4441
02:50:00,820 --> 02:50:01,620
already an angel.

4442
02:50:04,020 --> 02:50:04,580
I'm

4443
02:50:11,610 --> 02:50:12,170
lazy.

4444
02:50:12,850 --> 02:50:13,610
I'm careless.

4445
02:50:14,110 --> 02:50:16,930
I got her two eggs.

4446
02:50:17,550 --> 02:50:18,730
Two Easter eggs.

4447
02:50:19,070 --> 02:50:19,750
That's a huge...

4448
02:50:19,750 --> 02:50:20,270
That's big.

4449
02:50:20,530 --> 02:50:21,450
That is actually big.

4450
02:50:21,670 --> 02:50:22,450
I just dropped it.

4451
02:50:22,650 --> 02:50:23,350
I just dropped it.

4452
02:50:23,370 --> 02:50:24,450
Oh, she's on an Easter egg hunt.

4453
02:50:25,610 --> 02:50:27,230
But it's not Easter anymore.

4454
02:50:27,650 --> 02:50:28,790
Look at my bunny ears.

4455
02:50:29,190 --> 02:50:29,690
Yeah.

4456
02:50:30,850 --> 02:50:32,090
Where are we gonna go?

4457
02:50:32,110 --> 02:50:32,950
First stop sign.

4458
02:50:33,410 --> 02:50:34,650
Yeah, what are we gonna do with this?

4459
02:50:36,250 --> 02:50:36,890
Um...

4460
02:50:36,890 --> 02:50:38,810
We can go to...

4461
02:50:38,810 --> 02:50:39,930
Offense?

4462
02:50:41,190 --> 02:50:41,910
Whoops, I'm sorry.

4463
02:50:42,050 --> 02:50:43,410
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4464
02:50:44,310 --> 02:50:45,210
Hey, hey.

4465
02:50:45,470 --> 02:50:48,530
This is a professional environment, everybody.

4466
02:50:48,730 --> 02:50:49,350
Stop, stop.

4467
02:50:49,750 --> 02:50:50,390
I'm...

4468
02:50:50,390 --> 02:50:50,510
Yield.

4469
02:50:51,130 --> 02:50:51,770
Yield.

4470
02:50:53,450 --> 02:50:54,530
I'm not doing anything.

4471
02:50:56,430 --> 02:50:58,290
Let's go to...

4472
02:50:58,290 --> 02:51:00,130
I'm on my best behavior.

4473
02:51:01,510 --> 02:51:04,490
And I'm... Wait, what is this?

4474
02:51:05,010 --> 02:51:05,410
Confirm.

4475
02:51:05,870 --> 02:51:05,930
B.

4476
02:51:06,030 --> 02:51:07,090
For the big boss.

4477
02:51:07,530 --> 02:51:08,070
Yeah, big.

4478
02:51:09,630 --> 02:51:09,910
Yeah.

4479
02:51:10,350 --> 02:51:11,790
Oh, that's for me.

4480
02:51:11,930 --> 02:51:13,170
Is that, is this for me also?

4481
02:51:13,630 --> 02:51:14,270
Yeah, that's for you.

4482
02:51:14,910 --> 02:51:15,370
For you.

4483
02:51:16,850 --> 02:51:17,570
What happened?

4484
02:51:17,830 --> 02:51:19,490
Wait, I can't salute back at you.

4485
02:51:19,650 --> 02:51:20,470
Wait, can I twerk at you?

4486
02:51:20,550 --> 02:51:21,950
Whoa, what was that?

4487
02:51:22,410 --> 02:51:25,430
Oh, why is, why is the bed in the middle of the...

4488
02:51:25,430 --> 02:51:26,650
Oh, what's going on?

4489
02:51:28,730 --> 02:51:29,710
I'm telling us how.

4490
02:51:29,970 --> 02:51:31,650
You guys are rearranging the...

4491
02:51:32,790 --> 02:51:33,830
Oh, it's lovely.

4492
02:51:33,830 --> 02:51:35,130
I like the decor.

4493
02:51:36,310 --> 02:51:36,650
Yeah.

4494
02:51:37,130 --> 02:51:38,010
Oh, we can't get out.

4495
02:51:38,110 --> 02:51:38,510
Wait.

4496
02:51:38,770 --> 02:51:39,850
We gotta rearrange though.

4497
02:51:40,310 --> 02:51:41,070
We're stuck.

4498
02:51:42,650 --> 02:51:43,790
How do we...

4499
02:51:43,790 --> 02:51:45,410
How do we...

4500
02:51:45,410 --> 02:51:45,950
Move it.

4501
02:51:46,030 --> 02:51:46,550
I'll move it.

4502
02:51:46,750 --> 02:51:47,590
We can go around.

4503
02:51:47,790 --> 02:51:48,210
Oh, no, no.

4504
02:51:48,390 --> 02:51:48,490
It's B.

4505
02:51:49,550 --> 02:51:51,110
Because B and you move it.

4506
02:51:51,190 --> 02:51:52,150
Wait, I can't move it.

4507
02:51:52,450 --> 02:51:53,490
I can't move it.

4508
02:51:53,490 --> 02:51:53,650
I can't move it.

4509
02:51:53,870 --> 02:51:54,050
Oh, sorry.

4510
02:51:55,050 --> 02:51:55,770
Ah, that's so good.

4511
02:51:55,790 --> 02:51:56,710
Did you hit me?

4512
02:51:57,430 --> 02:51:58,510
No, that wasn't me.

4513
02:51:58,690 --> 02:51:59,850
I don't know if anything you quit.

4514
02:52:00,870 --> 02:52:01,790
What was that?

4515
02:52:01,850 --> 02:52:02,610
How are we moving?

4516
02:52:07,720 --> 02:52:09,300
It wasn't me.

4517
02:52:09,920 --> 02:52:10,940
It wasn't me.

4518
02:52:11,060 --> 02:52:11,540
I'm innocent.

4519
02:52:13,160 --> 02:52:14,060
Stop, son.

4520
02:52:14,980 --> 02:52:15,460
Collected.

4521
02:52:17,580 --> 02:52:18,280
Is it this way?

4522
02:52:18,600 --> 02:52:20,060
Actually, I have no idea where I'm going.

4523
02:52:20,980 --> 02:52:21,900
I wonder who.

4524
02:52:22,160 --> 02:52:23,240
They said press B.

4525
02:52:23,960 --> 02:52:24,320
And I did.

4526
02:52:25,700 --> 02:52:26,360
Is it this way?

4527
02:52:27,320 --> 02:52:29,640
I actually have no idea where I'm going, you guys.

4528
02:52:31,640 --> 02:52:32,040
Shaggy.

4529
02:52:32,220 --> 02:52:32,560
Rugggy.

4530
02:52:33,140 --> 02:52:34,300
Wait, can I jump over here?

4531
02:52:37,220 --> 02:52:37,700
Oh, no.

4532
02:52:37,720 --> 02:52:38,100
Nice.

4533
02:52:38,960 --> 02:52:40,600
And now I'm stuck.

4534
02:52:43,320 --> 02:52:44,500
Oh, wait.

4535
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:51,260
What?

4536
02:52:51,360 --> 02:52:51,680
What is this?

4537
02:52:52,060 --> 02:52:52,940
Oh, I found it.

4538
02:52:53,080 --> 02:52:54,260
I found it.

4539
02:52:56,560 --> 02:52:57,300
I think I'm a genius.

4540
02:52:59,540 --> 02:53:00,040
Bro, bro.

4541
02:53:04,280 --> 02:53:05,900
Where's the Scooby-Doo mod?

4542
02:53:06,680 --> 02:53:06,840
Where's the Scooby-Doo mod?

4543
02:53:10,560 --> 02:53:12,380
Doesn't that mean something's close?

4544
02:53:13,340 --> 02:53:13,940
This music?

4545
02:53:16,240 --> 02:53:16,700
Right?

4546
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:20,420
I'm not crazy, right?

4547
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:22,720
Yeah, because now...

4548
02:53:22,720 --> 02:53:23,880
Now I can't hear it.

4549
02:53:24,020 --> 02:53:24,520
Big bolt.

4550
02:53:24,920 --> 02:53:24,920
Where?

4551
02:53:26,040 --> 02:53:26,940
Oh, oh, mine.

4552
02:53:27,340 --> 02:53:27,760
Mine, okay.

4553
02:53:27,940 --> 02:53:28,160
Hello?

4554
02:53:29,140 --> 02:53:29,560
Whoa?

4555
02:53:31,300 --> 02:53:31,760
Okay.

4556
02:53:32,140 --> 02:53:32,740
Oh, it's over there.

4557
02:53:32,760 --> 02:53:33,340
Oh, wait, someone.

4558
02:53:33,680 --> 02:53:34,340
Stop talking.

4559
02:53:34,860 --> 02:53:36,120
Are you real?

4560
02:53:36,860 --> 02:53:37,980
You scared me.

4561
02:53:38,100 --> 02:53:39,040
There's a key back here.

4562
02:53:39,140 --> 02:53:40,900
There's a key back here, but don't stop on the mine.

4563
02:53:41,240 --> 02:53:41,620
Oh!

4564
02:53:42,080 --> 02:53:43,200
Oh, there's mine.

4565
02:53:43,580 --> 02:53:43,940
Yeah.

4566
02:53:44,580 --> 02:53:45,340
You locked through.

4567
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:46,520
You locked through your phone.

4568
02:53:47,380 --> 02:53:47,900
Oh, careful.

4569
02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:49,640
I'm going to go drop this.

4570
02:53:49,980 --> 02:53:51,180
Nothing else here.

4571
02:53:51,380 --> 02:53:52,420
Oh, I got a robot.

4572
02:53:53,340 --> 02:53:53,840
There's a robot.

4573
02:53:54,480 --> 02:53:54,660
Nice.

4574
02:53:55,360 --> 02:53:56,400
Okay, I'm going to try.

4575
02:53:57,660 --> 02:53:58,540
You guys don't hear music?

4576
02:53:58,780 --> 02:54:00,040
It's like an ambiance, you know?

4577
02:54:00,140 --> 02:54:00,860
It's not like a music.

4578
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:01,800
It's like a...

4579
02:54:12,660 --> 02:54:14,140
I have no excuse.

4580
02:54:14,780 --> 02:54:16,020
It's going crazy.

4581
02:54:16,500 --> 02:54:17,660
I'll leave you outside.

4582
02:54:19,040 --> 02:54:20,760

02:54:22,240 --> 02:54:23,040

Oh no!

4596
02:55:03,060 --> 02:55:03,580

Kill it!

02:55:06,480 --> 02:55:06,980
Hit him!

02:55:07,080 --> 02:55:07,440
Hit him!

02:55:16,490 --> 02:55:16,750
Hello.

4604
02:55:17,610 --> 02:55:18,730
I saved your life.

4605
02:55:20,390 --> 02:55:21,970
Oh, I lost the sign.

4606
02:55:22,150 --> 02:55:22,350
Oh my god.

4607
02:55:22,550 --> 02:55:23,150
Oh my god.

Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

02:55:30,890 --> 02:55:31,750
How are you guys doing today?

4612
02:55:32,130 --> 02:55:34,850
I haven't been able to talk to you so much because of the
collab.

4613
02:55:36,590 --> 02:55:37,750
Man, that is not the right way to go.

4614
02:55:37,770 --> 02:55:39,830
Oh my gosh, it killed me!

She's lost all control!

4619
02:55:53,490 --> 02:55:54,750
She truly lost it!

4620
02:55:54,750 --> 02:55:56,670
I just wanted to give her a little ball.

4621
02:55:56,970 --> 02:55:58,150
I'm dead and she's laughing!

Yep, that way.

02:56:58,730 --> 02:57:01,650
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the dogs are already out.

4632

I should go back, I'm running.

4637
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:36,960
I'm not sure she could fly her way.

4638
02:57:37,400 --> 02:57:37,820
Yeah, I don't know.

4639
02:57:37,840 --> 02:57:38,840
all if she can.

4640
02:57:42,210 --> 02:57:42,610
There we go.

4641
02:57:43,590 --> 02:57:44,950
No, no, this is the main entrance!

4642
02:57:46,070 --> 02:57:47,510
She's so lost!

4643
02:57:47,750 --> 02:57:48,570
She's so lost!

4644
02:57:49,130 --> 02:57:49,250
Dummy, Dummy, Dummy, Dummy!

4645
02:57:49,250 --> 02:57:50,630
Oh, Alyssa, you're so dumb.

4646
02:57:50,970 --> 02:57:52,310
She's unravelling!

4647
02:57:52,750 --> 02:57:53,390
I know not.

4648
02:57:53,550 --> 02:57:53,810
Just watch.

4649
02:57:55,230 --> 02:57:56,790
Of course I'm watching!

4650
02:58:00,930 --> 02:58:01,910
I'm watching you!

4651
02:58:02,250 --> 02:58:03,090
I'm just going around!

4652
02:58:06,170 --> 02:58:06,730
I'm just going around!

4653
02:58:06,730 --> 02:58:07,610
Be careful.

4654
02:58:08,090 --> 02:58:08,290
Oh.

4655
02:58:11,710 --> 02:58:21,970
She killed you good.

4656
02:58:22,170 --> 02:58:24,170
She killed you good.

4657
02:58:26,630 --> 02:58:30,450
No, I died to a bug.

4658
02:58:39,560 --> 02:58:41,860
Oh my god, Naki's hand just crouch, just crouch.

4659
02:58:42,180 --> 02:58:43,740
They won't see you if you crouch.

4660
02:58:46,280 --> 02:58:47,860
The weight of her studentism.

4661
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:52,560
I think she's gonna die.

4662
02:58:52,800 --> 02:58:53,860
I think she's gonna die.

4663
02:58:56,540 --> 02:58:59,420
I wonder if Mince and Emory is dead.

4664
02:58:59,840 --> 02:59:01,680
I hope not.

4665
02:59:02,280 --> 02:59:03,240
Oh, stop.

4666
02:59:04,640 --> 02:59:06,050
You're the one that killed people!

4667
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:09,640
I brought this upon myself.

4668
02:59:10,120 --> 02:59:10,620
Is this a ship?

4669
02:59:10,820 --> 02:59:11,000
Yeah!

4670
02:59:12,180 --> 02:59:13,440
Crouch, crouch, crouch.

4671
02:59:14,380 --> 02:59:15,820
I thought my yoke, crouch!

4672
02:59:32,630 --> 02:59:33,090
Okay,

4673
02:59:54,790 --> 02:59:57,770
this is her chance to go though, but she's not crouching,
she won't crouch.

4674
02:59:58,530 --> 02:59:59,050
This is...

4675
02:59:59,050 --> 03:00:00,810
The corpse is all on you now.

4676
03:00:01,750 --> 03:00:03,970
If you can hear their voices, what the fuck?

4677
03:00:04,630 --> 03:00:05,310
You can hear us?

4678
03:00:07,810 --> 03:00:08,270
Crouch!

4679
03:00:08,810 --> 03:00:10,250
If you can hear us, crouch!

4680
03:00:10,530 --> 03:00:10,850
Go!

4681
03:00:12,130 --> 03:00:12,770
No!

4682
03:00:14,690 --> 03:00:18,420
Not the run.

4683
03:00:19,240 --> 03:00:20,640
This is not the ride.

4684
03:00:21,080 --> 03:00:22,600
Why are you doing?

4685
03:00:23,480 --> 03:00:25,400
Why are you doing this?

4686
03:00:25,400 --> 03:00:27,480
Oh, there's no...

4687
03:00:27,480 --> 03:00:28,720
Oh, you're sorry.

4688
03:00:29,500 --> 03:00:29,660
Yes!

4689
03:00:30,780 --> 03:00:31,120
No!

4690
03:00:31,740 --> 03:00:32,980
I don't want to leave you there.

4691
03:00:33,140 --> 03:00:34,320
Sorry, there's a sign that's moving.

4692
03:00:35,520 --> 03:00:37,160
They were everywhere.

4693
03:00:38,020 --> 03:00:38,960
My head's so sad.

4694
03:00:40,540 --> 03:00:41,060
Pain.

4695
03:00:41,380 --> 03:00:41,880
Pain.

4696
03:00:43,340 --> 03:00:45,280
I owe Naki an apology.

4697
03:00:45,280 --> 03:00:46,420
I'm sorry, Naki.

4698
03:00:47,140 --> 03:00:48,800
She killed me!

4699
03:00:49,040 --> 03:00:51,160
I told you I was low on HP!

4700
03:00:51,480 --> 03:00:55,140
I just wanted you to help me and go and grab it.

4701
03:00:55,320 --> 03:00:56,800
You help me die, I guess.

4702
03:00:57,340 --> 03:00:58,820
What do we do?

4703
03:00:58,980 --> 03:01:00,040
What do we do?

4704
03:01:00,440 --> 03:01:02,020
Just feeling still.

4705
03:01:02,640 --> 03:01:04,720
Oh, this stuff is gone.

4706
03:01:05,140 --> 03:01:06,860
Sorry, guys.

4707
03:01:10,480 --> 03:01:11,100
Rip.

4708
03:01:13,340 --> 03:01:15,000
I'm so sad.

4709
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,540
I would never trust you again.

4710
03:01:17,940 --> 03:01:19,760
I love how I'm trust for you.

4711
03:01:19,860 --> 03:01:21,760
Wait, so what happened between you guys?

4712
03:01:22,600 --> 03:01:24,120
Elisaba killed me!

4713
03:01:24,480 --> 03:01:24,680

4714
03:01:25,860 --> 03:01:26,960
She hit me!

4715
03:01:27,840 --> 03:01:28,440
Actually!

4716
03:01:29,740 --> 03:01:32,240
I can explain.

4717
03:01:33,100 --> 03:01:34,880
No, you don't need to explain.

4718
03:01:36,700 --> 03:01:39,700
Look at my gesture right now.

4719
03:01:39,900 --> 03:01:41,980
Aw, she's just a minion.

4720
03:01:42,440 --> 03:01:43,220
She's just a minion.

the vlog.

4725
03:02:14,960 --> 03:02:18,620
I was low in HP, so I didn't want to go back in there.

4726
03:02:18,640 --> 03:02:21,340
I saw my did the finishing touch, you know.

4727
03:02:21,400 --> 03:02:22,580
See, because you're losing.

4728
03:02:23,260 --> 03:02:28,980
You guys threw me and you're close to the ship, so I thought
you'd make it back, so I didn't, like, I didn't, like, start

4729
03:02:28,980 --> 03:02:29,500
the ship.

4730
03:02:30,320 --> 03:02:30,700
Yeah.

4731
03:02:31,020 --> 03:02:32,540
But no, you...

4732
03:02:32,540 --> 03:02:35,120
What happened, though, with you was so messed up.

4733
03:02:35,220 --> 03:02:35,700
That was...

4734
03:02:35,700 --> 03:02:36,640
That shouldn't have happened.

4735
03:02:36,980 --> 03:02:37,420
Wait, wait.

4736
03:02:37,440 --> 03:02:38,460
I should have not died.

4737
03:02:39,080 --> 03:02:39,780
Because I was...

4738
03:02:39,780 --> 03:02:42,380
Okay, I was crouching the entire time here.

4739
03:02:42,520 --> 03:02:42,840
Oh.

4740
03:02:43,340 --> 03:02:46,220
Yeah, and then the dog was clipping through the ship.

4741
03:02:46,380 --> 03:02:48,480
Yeah, and then it ate her.

4742
03:02:49,240 --> 03:02:51,260
Yeah, like, I don't even understand.

4743
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:54,020

Little whoopsie.

4745
03:02:55,720 --> 03:02:56,040
It's okay.

4746
03:02:56,420 --> 03:03:00,960
Let's just, let's just, uh, we can just, like, land and then
take back off and die.

4747
03:03:01,100 --> 03:03:01,700
Oh, my God.

4748
03:03:03,280 --> 03:03:08,240

I don't know!

4753
03:03:16,280 --> 03:03:18,120
I don't know, it looks like a very nerdy novel.

4754
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:19,840
Can you do the thing?

4755
03:03:22,900 --> 03:03:23,780
Bang it.

4756
03:03:23,840 --> 03:03:24,500
I don't know.

4757
03:03:25,420 --> 03:03:26,820
She doesn't know the way!

4758
03:03:28,540 --> 03:03:28,980
She doesn't...

4759
03:03:28,980 --> 03:03:31,000
She doesn't know the way, Daniel?

4760
03:03:31,060 --> 03:03:31,820
She doesn't know the way?

4761
03:03:33,960 --> 03:03:36,340
Oh, you can't write a Jackson console?

4762
03:03:36,540 --> 03:03:37,160
Oh, I don't know.

4763
03:03:37,520 --> 03:03:39,740
No way!

4764
03:03:40,260 --> 03:03:42,300
Honestly, that means I would not respond.

4765
03:03:42,720 --> 03:03:44,780

It's gone.

You don't think that the dogs heard the Metal Gear music,
right?

4776
03:04:37,460 --> 03:04:39,380
Oh, did they?

4777

I don't think so, right?

4778
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:42,700
I don't have no idea.

4779
03:04:43,840 --> 03:04:46,560

Oh, oh, I didn't mean to do that.

4820
03:06:44,700 --> 03:06:47,580
Oh, oh, are you saying something?

4821
03:06:47,720 --> 03:06:48,780
No, no, no.

4822
03:06:48,900 --> 03:06:51,340
It's because I'm trying to say something, right?

4823
03:06:51,660 --> 03:06:54,220
I'm trying to say something, right?

4824
03:06:54,220 --> 03:07:00,140
I don't know why I'm not saying that.

4825
03:07:00,140 --> 03:07:02,340
Are you putting your face in my butt?

4826
03:07:03,260 --> 03:07:05,420
No, I think I know why you die, Emily.

4827
03:07:05,580 --> 03:07:06,940
It's because you're dumpy.

4828
03:07:08,500 --> 03:07:09,540
The dumpy.

4829
03:07:10,220 --> 03:07:11,680
The sound of your ass.

4830
03:07:11,700 --> 03:07:13,760
She clapping is gonna alert the dog.

4831
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
Hey, that's my job.

4832
03:07:19,080 --> 03:07:20,460
Let's go to Val.

4833
03:07:21,960 --> 03:07:22,280
Alright.

4834
03:07:22,880 --> 03:07:23,780
Here we go, guys.

4835
03:07:23,980 --> 03:07:24,460
This is it.

4836
03:07:25,480 --> 03:07:26,200
This is it.

4837
03:07:26,200 --> 03:07:26,600
We got this.

4838
03:07:27,620 --> 03:07:29,120
This is the run.

4839
03:07:29,260 --> 03:07:29,420
Alright.

4840
03:07:29,860 --> 03:07:30,640
This is it.

4841
03:07:31,100 --> 03:07:33,700
Last time when I feel like we're in danger...

4842
03:07:35,740 --> 03:07:36,720
Start the ship.

4843
03:07:39,180 --> 03:07:39,220
Yeah.

4844
03:07:39,660 --> 03:07:41,680
Next time I hear a dog, I will start the ship.

4845
03:07:41,700 --> 03:07:43,060
I do not trust dogs anymore.

4846
03:07:43,120 --> 03:07:43,960
Don't trust the dog.

4847
03:07:44,100 --> 03:07:44,700
Yeah, pretty much.

4848
03:07:44,720 --> 03:07:45,520
I do not trust them.

4849
03:07:45,740 --> 03:07:48,720
Yeah, I will start the ship as soon as I see a dog hero.

4850
03:07:50,800 --> 03:07:52,240
Which way was it again?

4851
03:07:52,540 --> 03:07:53,800
Is it this way?

4852
03:07:54,260 --> 03:07:54,580
Maybe.

4853
03:07:55,760 --> 03:07:56,060
Oh!

4854
03:07:57,560 --> 03:07:58,360
Not this way.

4855
03:07:58,580 --> 03:07:59,820
Don't go this way.

4856
03:08:00,460 --> 03:08:01,300
Don't go that way.

4857
03:08:01,300 --> 03:08:02,240
Come back, come back, turn back.

4858
03:08:02,380 --> 03:08:02,920
I think it's...

4859
03:08:04,160 --> 03:08:04,900
I don't remember.

4860
03:08:05,060 --> 03:08:06,200
Come on with a bridge, right?

4861
03:08:06,420 --> 03:08:07,080
Maybe it's there.

4862
03:08:08,040 --> 03:08:08,720
This way?

4863
03:08:09,520 --> 03:08:10,900
Wait, no, not that way.

4864
03:08:11,060 --> 03:08:11,220
Nope.

4865
03:08:13,400 --> 03:08:14,200
It's a...

4866
03:08:14,200 --> 03:08:15,200
I'm lost.

4867
03:08:16,400 --> 03:08:16,980
I have no idea.

4868
03:08:20,080 --> 03:08:21,080
Where is it?

4869
03:08:23,140 --> 03:08:24,000
Oh, it's here, it's here.

4870
03:08:24,140 --> 03:08:25,040
Watch out though, watch out.

4871
03:08:25,300 --> 03:08:28,160
There's a beehive right next to it.

4872
03:08:28,320 --> 03:08:30,200
That's a terrible place for beehives.

4873
03:08:31,640 --> 03:08:32,040
Wait,

4874
03:08:35,240 --> 03:08:36,560
we can just go to the other bridge.

4875
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:37,640
We can just go to the other bridge.

4876
03:08:38,440 --> 03:08:40,160
Oh yeah, over here, over here.

4877
03:08:40,340 --> 03:08:41,240
Yeah, the flimsy one.

4878
03:08:41,940 --> 03:08:43,400
Alright, I'll go on it.

4879
03:08:44,220 --> 03:08:46,220
Go, go, go!

4880
03:08:48,140 --> 03:08:48,320
Whoa!

4881
03:08:48,860 --> 03:08:49,020
Whoa!

4882
03:08:52,800 --> 03:08:56,680
Okay, we're good We're fine.

4883
03:08:57,940 --> 03:08:58,940
Little funny hopping.

4884
03:08:59,780 --> 03:09:00,440
Let's go!

4885
03:09:02,740 --> 03:09:05,720
Intrusive thoughts, because I was on it.

4886
03:09:05,900 --> 03:09:06,700
What?

4887
03:09:08,120 --> 03:09:10,040
She's real adulting, you know.

4888
03:09:10,060 --> 03:09:11,080
Let's go, guys.

4889
03:09:12,160 --> 03:09:12,760
Nice.

4890
03:09:18,340 --> 03:09:32,720
no was it worth it was it worth it betraying her losing all
the oh present oh gotcha like how you dropped that as fast

4891
03:09:32,720 --> 03:09:40,960
as you could just grab it oh nice yay so far a gotcha rate's
been good yeah so far good good I didn't see how much it was

4892
03:09:40,960 --> 03:09:45,060
worth though hmm the mod is working.

4893
03:09:45,220 --> 03:09:46,160
Maybe it's just not working.

4894
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:49,020
Hmm.

4895
03:09:49,500 --> 03:09:51,040
But I think it's pretty exciting anyway.

4896
03:09:51,140 --> 03:09:52,300
I'm gonna keep it out, put it outside.

4897
03:09:52,820 --> 03:09:52,920
Oh.

4898
03:09:54,180 --> 03:09:55,380
Yeah, I'm gonna drop this too.

4899
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:56,320
Damn.

4900
03:09:56,580 --> 03:09:56,900
Nice.

4901
03:09:58,560 --> 03:09:59,000
Loose.

4902
03:09:59,180 --> 03:09:59,940
Here, guys.

4903
03:10:00,240 --> 03:10:00,580
Hello.

4904
03:10:01,500 --> 03:10:02,100
What's wrong?

4905
03:10:02,200 --> 03:10:05,360
I thought we had something together, Naki.

4906
03:10:06,340 --> 03:10:06,920
What happened?

4907
03:10:08,680 --> 03:10:09,120
Hello?

4908
03:10:10,220 --> 03:10:11,280
It's Naki alive?

4909
03:10:11,300 --> 03:10:11,840
Oh, it might be the other way.

4910
03:10:12,320 --> 03:10:13,360
It might be the other way.

4911
03:10:14,220 --> 03:10:14,920
Oh, the other way.

4912
03:10:15,360 --> 03:10:16,400
Oh, but there's here, too.

4913
03:10:17,280 --> 03:10:18,820
Oh, the apparatus.

4914
03:10:19,040 --> 03:10:19,860
We'll have to grab it later.

4915
03:10:20,300 --> 03:10:20,940
Oh, yeah.

4916
03:10:22,800 --> 03:10:23,600
Over here?

4917
03:10:23,760 --> 03:10:23,980
Nothing?

4918
03:10:25,300 --> 03:10:25,480
Oh.

4919
03:10:27,900 --> 03:10:29,140
There's a dead end.

4920
03:10:31,060 --> 03:10:32,300
I hate dead ends.

4921
03:10:32,320 --> 03:10:33,500
I don't have anything as well.

4922
03:10:33,600 --> 03:10:34,860
Oh, we're back here.

4923
03:10:35,080 --> 03:10:35,540
Oh, hello.

4924
03:10:35,560 --> 03:10:36,020
I hear them.

4925
03:10:36,360 --> 03:10:37,940
Are we taking the apparatus?

4926
03:10:38,200 --> 03:10:39,400
Oh, you can be bugged.

4927
03:10:40,080 --> 03:10:40,900
Oh, gross.

4928
03:10:41,180 --> 03:10:42,020
You can be bugged.

4929
03:10:42,900 --> 03:10:43,440
Why don't...

4930
03:10:43,440 --> 03:10:44,200
Do we want to...

4931
03:10:44,220 --> 03:10:44,780
Ah!

4932
03:10:45,720 --> 03:10:46,100
Yippee!

4933
03:10:47,980 --> 03:10:48,360
Yippee!

4934
03:10:48,880 --> 03:10:50,080
Nope, I didn't get anything.

4935
03:10:50,920 --> 03:10:53,080
Let's go through the fire exit instead.

4936
03:10:57,020 --> 03:10:58,140
Let's do that, yeah.

4937
03:10:58,280 --> 03:10:59,380
Yeah, let's try the fire exit.

4938
03:10:59,480 --> 03:11:01,180
Do you want to carry this back or leave it here?

4939
03:11:01,680 --> 03:11:02,060
Uh...

4940
03:11:02,060 --> 03:11:03,280
I think we should carry it back.

4941
03:11:03,300 --> 03:11:04,400
Yeah, I think so too.

4942
03:11:04,680 --> 03:11:05,040
Carry it back.

4943
03:11:05,060 --> 03:11:05,480
Okay, okay.

4944
03:11:05,820 --> 03:11:07,780
I think I think people can hold everything.

4945
03:11:07,980 --> 03:11:08,260
Yippee!

4946
03:11:08,480 --> 03:11:09,740
Yeah, two people can hold everything.

4947
03:11:09,820 --> 03:11:11,080
Maybe two of us can go back.

4948
03:11:11,300 --> 03:11:12,060
No, drop that.

4949
03:11:12,140 --> 03:11:14,100
Drop that Naki and then pick up that first.

4950
03:11:14,220 --> 03:11:26,080
there you go there you go okay i'm going to fire okay let's

the other side Huh, dummy.

4953
03:11:46,280 --> 03:11:47,100
Wait, there's a hairbrush?

4954
03:11:47,720 --> 03:11:48,000
Somewhere?

4955
03:11:48,700 --> 03:11:49,600
Where is it?

4956
03:11:50,080 --> 03:11:50,740
Do you get it?

4957
03:11:50,860 --> 03:11:52,080
I scanned the hairbrush somewhere.

4958
03:11:53,580 --> 03:11:54,620
Where is it?

4959
03:11:54,880 --> 03:11:55,580
One hairbrush?

4960
03:11:57,140 --> 03:11:58,380
Oh, where is it?

4961
03:11:58,680 --> 03:11:59,240
You see it?

4962
03:11:59,300 --> 03:12:00,000
Do you see it too?

4963
03:12:00,960 --> 03:12:01,380
No?

4964
03:12:03,540 --> 03:12:05,240
Oh, there's a hairbrush over here.

4965
03:12:05,360 --> 03:12:06,000
It's on top.

4966
03:12:06,180 --> 03:12:07,300
Oh, it's up top.

4967
03:12:08,120 --> 03:12:08,580
Yeah.

4968
03:12:09,700 --> 03:12:11,040
I got it.

4969
03:12:11,480 --> 03:12:12,260
Gonna open this.

4970
03:12:12,880 --> 03:12:13,080
Oh.

4971
03:12:16,140 --> 03:12:18,060
Yeah, we can grab that.

4972
03:12:18,140 --> 03:12:19,500
Wait, I can't tell if that was them or not.

4973
03:12:28,090 --> 03:12:29,510
This is a big area.

4974
03:12:31,250 --> 03:12:32,410
There should be something here.

4975
03:12:32,550 --> 03:12:33,290
There's an engine.

4976
03:12:35,850 --> 03:12:36,250
Yeah.

4977
03:12:38,070 --> 03:12:39,690
Maybe save the bigger stuff for later.

4978
03:12:41,390 --> 03:12:42,390
This area is huge.

4979
03:12:42,670 --> 03:12:42,930
Scanning.

4980
03:12:43,250 --> 03:12:44,290
Yeah, I'm scanning.

4981
03:12:45,570 --> 03:12:45,790
Wait.

4982
03:12:46,090 --> 03:12:47,450
Okay, this is finally a dead end.

4983
03:12:47,610 --> 03:12:47,870
Oh.

4984
03:12:48,330 --> 03:12:48,510
Okay.

4985
03:12:49,030 --> 03:12:50,810
Okay, then there's no other way.

4986
03:12:50,850 --> 03:12:51,610
You have to go back.

4987
03:12:51,770 --> 03:12:51,990
Yeah.

4988
03:12:52,150 --> 03:12:52,310
Wait.

4989
03:12:52,630 --> 03:12:53,290
Uh, no, yeah.

4990
03:12:53,470 --> 03:12:54,450
No other way.

4991
03:12:54,890 --> 03:12:55,290
Okay.

4992
03:12:56,230 --> 03:12:56,950
I'm here.

4993
03:12:58,230 --> 03:12:58,630
Yeah.

4994
03:12:59,790 --> 03:13:00,870
There's the- Oh, there's something.

4995
03:13:01,070 --> 03:13:02,110
Yeah, there's the engine.

4996
03:13:03,630 --> 03:13:04,910
Oh, and there's a key too.

4997
03:13:05,030 --> 03:13:07,810
This is where I died earlier.

4998
03:13:09,650 --> 03:13:10,750
I got it.

4999
03:13:11,030 --> 03:13:12,210
I'll get the engine.

5000
03:13:12,430 --> 03:13:12,730
Okay.

5001
03:13:13,650 --> 03:13:14,730
Okay, I have it.

5002
03:13:14,810 --> 03:13:15,030
Nice.

5003
03:13:15,030 --> 03:13:15,910
Can go back, maybe.

5004
03:13:17,610 --> 03:13:18,490
Is this the way back?

5005
03:13:18,850 --> 03:13:20,090
Yeah, this is the way back.

5006
03:13:20,970 --> 03:13:21,470
All right.

5007
03:13:21,970 --> 03:13:23,630
And there's also this way, too.

5008
03:13:25,870 --> 03:13:27,550
I'm going to check it.

5009
03:13:27,710 --> 03:13:29,330
No, we haven't gone here yet.

5010
03:13:29,570 --> 03:13:30,530
Let's check it out just a little bit.

5011
03:13:30,650 --> 03:13:30,770
Oh.

5012
03:13:31,790 --> 03:13:33,230
And it's a dead end.

5013
03:13:33,250 --> 03:13:33,850
Dead end.

5014
03:13:34,290 --> 03:13:34,570
Nice.

5015
03:13:34,690 --> 03:13:35,710
Dead end.

5016
03:13:35,970 --> 03:13:37,050
We're not going to die, guys.

5017
03:13:37,190 --> 03:13:37,530
We're good.

5018
03:13:39,830 --> 03:13:41,130
Yeah, I have a hairbrush.

5019
03:13:41,630 --> 03:13:41,770
Yeah.

5020
03:13:41,910 --> 03:13:43,490
I can protect you with a hairbrush.

5021
03:13:43,950 --> 03:13:45,490
You're going to style me.

5022
03:13:46,570 --> 03:13:47,590
Oh, there's an egg beetle.

5023
03:13:49,310 --> 03:13:50,230
Did we...

5024
03:13:50,230 --> 03:13:51,610
Wait, did we come this way?

5025
03:13:53,010 --> 03:13:53,210
Wait.

5026
03:13:53,670 --> 03:13:55,450
Upstairs, upstairs, upstairs, right?

5027
03:13:55,710 --> 03:13:56,990
Yeah, yeah.

5028
03:13:57,730 --> 03:13:58,030
No.

5029
03:13:58,550 --> 03:13:58,970
Wait.

5030
03:13:59,290 --> 03:14:00,730
Oh, wait.

5031
03:14:01,210 --> 03:14:04,490
Over here, over here.

5032
03:14:04,590 --> 03:14:05,870
This way?

5033
03:14:06,170 --> 03:14:08,990
It's a dead end!

5034
03:14:10,150 --> 03:14:10,710
Wait!

5035
03:14:13,420 --> 03:14:15,200
Yeah, I think this is the wrong way.

5036
03:14:15,800 --> 03:14:16,900
I think it's on the other side.

5037
03:14:17,280 --> 03:14:18,220
Is it other side?

5038
03:14:18,480 --> 03:14:19,260
Okay, okay.

5039
03:14:19,940 --> 03:14:20,500
other side.

5040
03:14:21,240 --> 03:14:21,240
Okay.

5041
03:14:21,680 --> 03:14:23,180
Wait, it's not this right here, right?

5042
03:14:24,120 --> 03:14:24,620
Maybe it's here?

5043
03:14:24,980 --> 03:14:28,040
Yeah, this is the one with the... Did we go here?

5044
03:14:29,520 --> 03:14:30,860
Oh, yeah, we went here.

5045
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:31,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5046
03:14:33,180 --> 03:14:35,200
I think you should trust the other side.

5047
03:14:35,440 --> 03:14:36,120
Right over here.

5048
03:14:38,600 --> 03:14:40,480
Wait, how do we get here?

5049
03:14:40,480 --> 03:14:43,160
Yeah, you go up and then you can go across.

5050
03:14:43,840 --> 03:14:46,840
Wait, it's so... Oh, wait, we came from over here, right?

5051
03:14:48,360 --> 03:14:51,280
Oh, oh, I don't remember.

5052
03:14:51,360 --> 03:14:52,200
I think it was here.

5053
03:14:55,360 --> 03:14:55,620
Yeah.

5054
03:14:56,220 --> 03:14:57,800
Oh, yeah, because the thumper, I can hear him.

5055
03:14:59,880 --> 03:15:00,980
Oh, yeah, right, right, right.

5056
03:15:01,040 --> 03:15:02,760
Yeah, and it was downstairs.

5057
03:15:05,580 --> 03:15:07,020
Right here, right here, right here.

5058
03:15:07,080 --> 03:15:08,760
There we go, there we go.

5059
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:09,760
Oh.

5060
03:15:10,460 --> 03:15:11,540
At 6 p.m.

5061
03:15:12,580 --> 03:15:13,380
Uh-oh.

5062
03:15:13,460 --> 03:15:14,600
Is it following us?

5063
03:15:14,720 --> 03:15:15,960
No, that's the giant.

5064
03:15:16,120 --> 03:15:16,860
We gotta go.

5065
03:15:17,820 --> 03:15:18,620
Oh, no.

5066
03:15:18,860 --> 03:15:19,740
We gotta go.

5067
03:15:22,360 --> 03:15:33,320
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, oh there's a, there's another beehive, okay, all

5068
03:15:33,320 --> 03:15:48,160
right, follow me, way back, it's only seven, there's already
a giant out, oh, oh God, it's over here, where, to a, here,

5069
03:15:48,280 --> 03:15:51,380
the ship, yeah, oh God, oh, the giant saw me, I think, oh.

5070
03:15:51,400 --> 03:15:52,760
Oh, oh, oh.

5071
03:15:53,260 --> 03:15:54,160
I think I'm dead.

5072
03:15:55,320 --> 03:15:56,100
Wait, I found the ship.

5073
03:16:02,780 --> 03:16:03,660
Caught him.

5074
03:16:03,860 --> 03:16:04,120
Caught him.

5075
03:16:04,840 --> 03:16:06,160
Ah, my hands are full.

5076
03:16:07,160 --> 03:16:07,980
Start the ship.

5077
03:16:08,260 --> 03:16:08,440
Start the ship.

5078
03:16:08,480 --> 03:16:08,960
Start the ship.

5079
03:16:09,160 --> 03:16:09,560
Start the ship.

5080
03:16:09,980 --> 03:16:12,080
Don't wait.

5081
03:16:12,480 --> 03:16:13,160
Good job, good job.

5082
03:16:13,460 --> 03:16:14,280
Where's Naki?

5083
03:16:14,900 --> 03:16:15,800
I think she died.

5084
03:16:16,100 --> 03:16:16,460
I think you died.

5085
03:16:16,600 --> 03:16:17,240
She didn't make it.

5086
03:16:18,140 --> 03:16:20,880
Oh, she's just not on the screen.

5087
03:16:21,220 --> 03:16:21,800
Where'd she go?

5088
03:16:22,860 --> 03:16:23,620
He wasn't real.

5089
03:16:24,460 --> 03:16:26,220
But I thought we heard her.

5090
03:16:26,360 --> 03:16:26,900
We heard her.

5091
03:16:27,300 --> 03:16:28,180
Oh, it wasn't her then.

5092
03:16:28,260 --> 03:16:28,760
No way.

5093
03:16:28,920 --> 03:16:29,280
You did?

5094
03:16:29,580 --> 03:16:30,220
I didn't.

5095
03:16:30,360 --> 03:16:31,500
Oh, I heard her.

5096
03:16:32,160 --> 03:16:33,800
It must have been the thumper, I think.

5097
03:16:34,440 --> 03:16:34,860
Yeah.

5098
03:16:36,280 --> 03:16:36,740
Yeah.

5099
03:16:38,560 --> 03:16:40,400
I'm glad you guys made it back.

5100
03:16:40,640 --> 03:16:41,600
Oh, the giant got you.

5101
03:16:41,940 --> 03:16:42,180
The giant?

5102
03:16:42,520 --> 03:16:42,880
Whoa.

5103
03:16:43,260 --> 03:16:44,340
Yeah, that's what I thought.

5104
03:16:44,440 --> 03:16:46,500
Oh, that's why you weren't on the screen.

5105
03:16:48,580 --> 03:16:49,900
But we're at quota.

5106
03:16:50,180 --> 03:16:50,820
We're at quota.

5107
03:16:51,300 --> 03:16:51,500
Yeah.

5108
03:16:51,900 --> 03:16:52,840
We still got two days.

5109
03:16:52,860 --> 03:16:53,320
Yeah.

5110
03:16:54,020 --> 03:16:54,460
Okay.

5111
03:16:55,300 --> 03:16:56,180
Let's see.

5112
03:16:56,640 --> 03:16:59,000
How much money do we need to go to Moon?

5113
03:16:59,380 --> 03:17:01,940
We need 600, I'm pretty sure.

5114
03:17:02,400 --> 03:17:03,420
Oh my gosh, it's a lot of money.

5115
03:17:04,320 --> 03:17:04,380
Yeah.

5116
03:17:05,100 --> 03:17:06,560
Yeah, I don't think we even make it.

5117
03:17:07,700 --> 03:17:08,060
I don't know.

5118
03:17:08,220 --> 03:17:08,900
It'll be like...

5119
03:17:09,400 --> 03:17:11,680
Oh wait, Rend is 550.

5120
03:17:11,900 --> 03:17:12,120
We can.

5121
03:17:12,940 --> 03:17:13,380
Oh.

5122
03:17:13,820 --> 03:17:14,360
Uh-huh.

5123
03:17:16,940 --> 03:17:20,640
That seems more doable if we get like the same amount of
loot again.

5124
03:17:21,100 --> 03:17:22,100
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

5125
03:17:22,860 --> 03:17:23,660
Okay, okay.

5126
03:17:24,380 --> 03:17:27,100
Let's do assurance.

5127
03:17:28,760 --> 03:17:29,140
Night.

5128
03:17:29,660 --> 03:17:29,660
Okay.

5129
03:17:30,160 --> 03:17:30,360
Confirm.

5130
03:17:31,600 --> 03:17:31,820
And go.

5131
03:17:33,020 --> 03:17:33,500
Yeah.

5132
03:17:34,560 --> 03:17:35,400
Good run, good run.

5133
03:17:36,940 --> 03:17:37,160
Yeah.

5134
03:17:37,540 --> 03:17:38,640
Let's go, guys.

5135
03:17:38,880 --> 03:17:39,180
Let's go.

5136
03:17:39,720 --> 03:17:40,680
Just gotta keep it up.

5137
03:17:41,480 --> 03:17:42,120
Keep it up.

5138
03:17:43,200 --> 03:17:44,380
All right, I'm landing.

5139
03:17:47,400 --> 03:17:49,880
Mansion is on Renn or Dine?

5140
03:17:50,120 --> 03:17:50,760
Oh, okay.

5141
03:17:51,400 --> 03:17:52,840
So we have to go to Renn or Dine?

5142
03:17:52,860 --> 03:17:53,280
I know.

5143
03:17:53,580 --> 03:17:53,680
Okay.

5144
03:17:54,320 --> 03:17:54,840
Okay.

5145
03:17:55,920 --> 03:17:56,760
You heard that?

5146
03:17:56,760 --> 03:17:57,980
It's probably the...

5147
03:17:57,980 --> 03:17:58,700
The voices.

5148
03:17:59,060 --> 03:17:59,620
It's the voices.

5149
03:18:01,260 --> 03:18:02,860
And then load the kind of glitches in it.

5150
03:18:03,240 --> 03:18:03,940
Wait, so...

5151
03:18:07,260 --> 03:18:08,780
Rend is 550.

5152
03:18:08,960 --> 03:18:10,140
Oh, so we could go to Rend, right?

5153
03:18:11,120 --> 03:18:11,440
Okay.

5154
03:18:11,820 --> 03:18:13,420
So we just need more money.

Wait, we should have gone.

5252
03:23:52,100 --> 03:23:52,680
No, it's okay.

5253
03:23:52,960 --> 03:23:54,260
It only lasts for a little bit.

03:23:55,460 --> 03:23:56,120
I see.

5255
03:23:56,660 --> 03:23:58,640
Apparently, apparently the turrets were turned off.

Yeah, you can turn off the turrets.

5257
03:24:01,300 --> 03:24:03,100
No, I know you can't.

5258
03:24:03,120 --> 03:24:04,660

5259
03:24:05,180 --> 03:24:05,620
Oh, yeah.

5260
03:24:05,940 --> 03:24:06,260

Exactly, you guys.

Okay.

There we go.

5309
03:26:21,200 --> 03:26:21,580
Okay.

5310
03:26:22,000 --> 03:26:22,600
I'm sorry.

03:26:23,160 --> 03:26:23,560
There you go.

5312
03:26:24,100 --> 03:26:24,760
No worries.

5313
03:26:25,320 --> 03:26:26,960
What is this building here?

5314
03:26:27,020 --> 03:26:28,080
I've never noticed this before.

5315
03:26:28,960 --> 03:26:29,240
Whoa.

5316
03:26:31,240 --> 03:26:32,240
Oh, what the heck?

03:26:33,800 --> 03:26:34,260
Huh?

03:26:34,460 --> 03:26:35,940
I've never noticed this before.

5319
03:26:36,220 --> 03:26:36,860
What is this?

5320
03:26:36,960 --> 03:26:37,320
Yeah.

5321
03:26:37,560 --> 03:26:38,300
I'm scared though.

5322
03:26:38,300 --> 03:26:40,220
There's trees and stuff in here.

5323
03:26:41,600 --> 03:26:42,380
That's spooky.

5324
03:26:42,720 --> 03:26:43,300
It's like a haunted house.

5325
03:26:43,300 --> 03:26:46,800
Let's just, uh, it's like a, it's like teleport to another
world.

5326
03:26:47,600 --> 03:26:48,120
Stick to the plan.

5327
03:26:48,340 --> 03:26:48,900
Stick to the plan.

5328
03:26:49,420 --> 03:26:51,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, work smarter.

5329
03:26:51,260 --> 03:26:52,080
Yeah, the plan, the plan.

5330
03:26:53,240 --> 03:26:56,220
But what's in there?

5331
03:26:56,300 --> 03:26:57,300
But what's in there?

5332
03:26:58,220 --> 03:27:00,700
But, but what's in there?

5333
03:27:01,020 --> 03:27:02,120
Oh, we got lost.

5334
03:27:02,180 --> 03:27:02,600
That's crazy.

5335
03:27:03,700 --> 03:27:05,220
Are you lost?

5336
03:27:05,720 --> 03:27:06,200
Naki.

5337
03:27:08,300 --> 03:27:10,100
The same one's like the other way.

5338
03:27:11,460 --> 03:27:11,960
You okay?

5339
03:27:12,180 --> 03:27:13,020
Okay, there they are.

5340
03:27:13,220 --> 03:27:13,640
We're good.

5341
03:27:14,160 --> 03:27:14,740
Everyone's good.

5342
03:27:15,260 --> 03:27:15,720
All right.

5343
03:27:15,800 --> 03:27:17,240
And in.

5344
03:27:19,680 --> 03:27:20,320
All right.

5345
03:27:20,560 --> 03:27:21,500
Oh, yield sign.

5346
03:27:22,540 --> 03:27:22,860

5348
03:27:28,860 --> 03:27:29,400
Nothing here.

5349
03:27:29,620 --> 03:27:30,380
It's a pretty big room.

5350
03:27:31,160 --> 03:27:31,620
Nothing here.

5351
03:27:32,200 --> 03:27:32,940

Wow.

5355
03:27:35,180 --> 03:27:37,060
This planet's holding out on us.

5356
03:27:37,320 --> 03:27:37,820
What a waste.

5357
03:27:38,880 --> 03:27:39,580
Nice sign.

5358
03:27:40,020 --> 03:27:40,520
Nothing here.

5364
03:27:58,680 --> 03:28:04,140
It's a mine, it's a mine I can hear it.

5365
03:28:05,100 --> 03:28:05,900
Where was it?

5366
03:28:06,400 --> 03:28:07,280
Oh there?

5367
03:28:07,440 --> 03:28:07,900
Is it?

5368
03:28:08,760 --> 03:28:09,880
You can just scan.

5369
03:28:10,820 --> 03:28:12,000
Oh, it's over hei, it's over here.

5370
03:28:12,700 --> 03:28:13,200
Okay.

5371
03:28:13,520 --> 03:28:13,520
Okay.

5372
03:28:16,100 --> 03:28:18,120
Oh, I don't think it's safe to go over here.

5373
03:28:18,160 --> 03:28:19,060
I don't think...

5374
03:28:19,060 --> 03:28:19,480
I think it's...

5375
03:28:19,480 --> 03:28:19,900
Yeah, we can go here.

5376
03:28:20,340 --> 03:28:21,980
I think it's hard to get around it, though.

5377
03:28:22,860 --> 03:28:24,160
How are you going to go this way?

5378
03:28:25,080 --> 03:28:26,400
It's pretty tall.

5379
03:28:26,620 --> 03:28:26,900
Nice.

5380
03:28:27,780 --> 03:28:28,560
Oh, dead end.

5381
03:28:28,880 --> 03:28:29,420
Dead end.

5382
03:28:30,080 --> 03:28:31,540
Down, down.

5383
03:28:31,620 --> 03:28:31,780
Down.

5384
03:28:38,500 --> 03:28:39,560
I'll go this way.

5385
03:28:39,580 --> 03:28:40,200
I'll go...

5386
03:28:40,200 --> 03:28:41,340
Okay, I'll go this way.

5387
03:28:42,080 --> 03:28:43,380
Okay, I'll do this way.

5388
03:28:43,820 --> 03:28:46,200
Uh, there's a lot of ways to go.

5389
03:28:48,540 --> 03:28:49,340
Open areas.

5390
03:28:49,840 --> 03:28:51,700
I feel like they're just all gonna...

5391
03:28:51,720 --> 03:29:02,440
loop around though and oh hi hi it was a dead end there's
another there's another mine all right i'm careful i think

5392
03:29:02,440 --> 03:29:14,040
this also loops maybe it might be smart to leave and find
fire at this oh wait where what is this oh there is a door

5393
03:29:14,040 --> 03:29:23,720
here there's a door here there is okay yeah yeah over here
oh oh nice Oh, it just looped.

5394
03:29:24,780 --> 03:29:25,200
No way.

5395
03:29:29,260 --> 03:29:33,180
Wait, where does that key go?

5396
03:29:35,840 --> 03:29:37,580
How do we even...

5397
03:29:37,580 --> 03:29:39,440
I think we came from up.

5398
03:29:39,840 --> 03:29:40,520
I think so too.

5399
03:29:41,380 --> 03:29:43,400
How will we even get to the fire exit?

5400
03:29:43,500 --> 03:29:45,400
I don't know where it is on this.

5401
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:49,100
We'll try to go outside.

5402
03:29:49,360 --> 03:29:50,700
We have to go outside again.

5403
03:29:52,900 --> 03:29:53,380
Yeah.

5404
03:29:55,200 --> 03:29:56,380
I'm going the right way.

5405
03:29:56,660 --> 03:29:57,240
I think you are.

5406
03:29:57,360 --> 03:29:57,760
I think you are.

5407
03:29:58,040 --> 03:29:59,080
Oh, yes I am.

5408
03:29:59,340 --> 03:29:59,720
Yeah.

5409
03:30:00,520 --> 03:30:00,920
All right.

5410
03:30:00,940 --> 03:30:02,580
I'm just a natural genius.

5411
03:30:04,540 --> 03:30:04,800
I think.

5412
03:30:05,580 --> 03:30:06,660
Still no free run.

5413
03:30:07,380 --> 03:30:08,280
I can't believe we lost.

5414
03:30:08,420 --> 03:30:09,380
Oh yeah, of course.

5415
03:30:09,540 --> 03:30:10,900
The fire exits right over here.

5416
03:30:11,480 --> 03:30:12,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5417
03:30:12,200 --> 03:30:13,640
I forgot we were on experimentation.

5418
03:30:14,440 --> 03:30:14,500
Yeah.

5419
03:30:15,840 --> 03:30:16,600
I forgot.

5420
03:30:17,540 --> 03:30:18,780
Wait, did I pass it?

5421
03:30:18,900 --> 03:30:19,160
Yes.

5422
03:30:25,050 --> 03:30:28,150
So many stairs.

5423
03:30:28,390 --> 03:30:28,890
Oh no.

5424
03:30:29,850 --> 03:30:30,790
It's already two.

5425
03:30:31,370 --> 03:30:33,010
I got nothing except the sign.

5426
03:30:33,870 --> 03:30:35,890
I only got this metal sheet, so...

5427
03:30:35,890 --> 03:30:37,750
Yeah, we need more if we want to make it to.

5428
03:30:38,330 --> 03:30:38,650
Ren.

5429
03:30:39,410 --> 03:30:40,310
Next time.

5430
03:30:40,690 --> 03:30:41,730
That we'll find.

5431
03:30:41,930 --> 03:30:43,470
I think it's possible to find something here.

5432
03:30:45,490 --> 03:30:46,810
Oh, the door here?

5433
03:30:47,330 --> 03:30:48,230
Oh, Freeran!

5434
03:30:50,070 --> 03:30:50,590
Freeran!

5435
03:30:51,810 --> 03:30:52,330
Yad!

5436
03:30:55,640 --> 03:30:57,440
She came back to us.

5437
03:30:57,980 --> 03:30:59,540
Yeah, well, we saw we lost her.

Wait, where is it?

5442
03:31:32,200 --> 03:31:33,380
Am I blind, you guys?

5443
03:31:34,220 --> 03:31:35,140
I don't see it.

5444
03:31:35,180 --> 03:31:35,960
Oh, I hear a cat!

5445
03:31:36,740 --> 03:31:38,500
We're gonna get Freerend and a cat!

5446
03:31:38,820 --> 03:31:39,480
No way.

5447
03:31:40,220 --> 03:31:41,260
Let's do it.

5448
03:31:42,300 --> 03:31:42,860
Cat.

5449

Meow!

5452
03:31:49,620 --> 03:31:51,000
Oliver, let's go!

5453
03:31:51,520 --> 03:31:52,240
Where is he?

5454
03:31:52,880 --> 03:31:53,680
I don't...

5455
03:31:53,680 --> 03:31:54,200
I don't know.

5456
03:31:54,360 --> 03:31:54,560
I don't know.

5457
03:31:54,560 --> 03:31:54,940
I don't even know if you found him.

5458
03:31:55,640 --> 03:31:56,260
Meow.

5459
03:31:57,700 --> 03:31:58,200
Kitty?

5460
03:31:58,720 --> 03:31:59,060
Hello?

5461
03:32:00,720 --> 03:32:01,980
Where is he?

5462
03:32:02,700 --> 03:32:02,840
Oh!

5463
03:32:03,160 --> 03:32:05,660
I know, I feel so sorry for him.

5464
03:32:05,840 --> 03:32:06,840
Where are you?

5465
03:32:07,760 --> 03:32:08,140
Oliver.

5466
03:32:09,120 --> 03:32:09,880
Oh, maybe...

5467
03:32:09,880 --> 03:32:10,160
Yeah.

5468
03:32:12,620 --> 03:32:13,140
Oliver?

5469
03:32:15,360 --> 03:32:15,920
Oliver?

5470
03:32:19,560 --> 03:32:24,340
I scanned him earlier, but now he's gone where I scanned
him.

5471
03:32:25,040 --> 03:32:25,660
Oh, I heard him!

5472
03:32:26,100 --> 03:32:26,340
Yeah.

5473
03:32:29,340 --> 03:32:30,480
Did I just go in a circle?

5474
03:32:33,040 --> 03:32:33,340
What?

5475
03:32:36,080 --> 03:32:37,040
Oh my gosh.

5476
03:32:37,160 --> 03:32:38,040
Oh wait, maybe in here.

5477
03:32:38,980 --> 03:32:39,520
Meow.

5478
03:32:41,830 --> 03:32:43,670
Did you go down or off?

5479
03:32:43,830 --> 03:32:44,510
I'm down.

5480
03:32:47,740 --> 03:32:47,960
Oh.

5481
03:32:48,900 --> 03:32:50,300
It's quiet, you guys.

5482
03:32:50,420 --> 03:32:51,480
It's a little too quiet.

5483
03:32:52,680 --> 03:32:52,760
Meow.

5484
03:32:53,160 --> 03:32:53,580
Meow.

5485
03:32:53,980 --> 03:32:55,660
I see the metal sheet.

5486
03:32:55,840 --> 03:32:56,560
I can't grab it though.

5487
03:32:56,580 --> 03:32:57,600
I know, I can't get it either.

5488
03:32:58,640 --> 03:32:59,360
Oh wait, wait.

5489
03:32:59,680 --> 03:33:00,200
I got it.

5490
03:33:00,380 --> 03:33:01,060
I got it.

5491
03:33:01,060 --> 03:33:02,020
A gamer.

5492
03:33:02,380 --> 03:33:02,800
Nice.

5493
03:33:03,400 --> 03:33:04,560
But where's Oliver?

5494
03:33:06,200 --> 03:33:06,580
Here.

5495
03:33:06,740 --> 03:33:07,780
I can hear him.

5496
03:33:08,880 --> 03:33:12,760
I want to get him and then we, you know what, I think we
should get him and then actually it's probably really late,

5497
03:33:12,860 --> 03:33:13,040
Emory.

5498
03:33:13,200 --> 03:33:14,080
I think we should just leave.

5499
03:33:14,620 --> 03:33:15,400
Yeah, maybe.

5500
03:33:15,620 --> 03:33:16,300
Okay, how do we leave?

5501
03:33:16,380 --> 03:33:16,840
I don't know.

5502
03:33:17,360 --> 03:33:18,100
Oliver, I'm sorry.

5503
03:33:19,560 --> 03:33:20,200
Sorry, Oliver.

5504
03:33:20,580 --> 03:33:21,420
I wanted to get you.

5505
03:33:22,180 --> 03:33:22,780
Where'd you go?

5506
03:33:22,980 --> 03:33:23,440
Oh, that way?

5507
03:33:23,620 --> 03:33:23,780
Okay.

5508
03:33:23,780 --> 03:33:24,500
I think we went down.

5509
03:33:24,760 --> 03:33:24,880
Yeah.

5510
03:33:25,400 --> 03:33:25,440
Okay.

5511
03:33:25,440 --> 03:33:25,680
Wait.

5512
03:33:26,980 --> 03:33:28,500
And then which way was it?

5513
03:33:29,880 --> 03:33:30,360
This way?

5514
03:33:30,620 --> 03:33:31,060
This way?

5515
03:33:31,200 --> 03:33:31,420
Okay.

5516
03:33:33,220 --> 03:33:33,660
Uh-oh.

5517
03:33:34,660 --> 03:33:34,980
Uh-oh.

5518
03:33:35,160 --> 03:33:36,440
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

5519
03:33:36,740 --> 03:33:40,000
Yeah, it's already six.

5520
03:33:40,460 --> 03:33:41,360
We got free run, you guys.

5521
03:33:41,500 --> 03:33:41,820
It's okay.

5522
03:33:42,620 --> 03:33:43,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5523
03:33:44,200 --> 03:33:44,660
Oliver.

5524
03:33:46,880 --> 03:33:49,760
I'm gonna be thinking about Oliver all day today now.

5525
03:33:49,880 --> 03:33:50,780
I'm gonna feel so bad.

5526
03:34:09,420 --> 03:34:10,260
No creature.

5527
03:34:11,420 --> 03:34:11,660
Yeah.

5528
03:34:33,260 --> 03:34:34,200
Where are you?

5529
03:34:35,040 --> 03:34:35,480
You good?

5530
03:34:35,960 --> 03:34:36,140
Oh.

5531
03:34:56,780 --> 03:34:59,000
I hope they were dead.

5532
03:35:00,220 --> 03:35:00,920
Oh.

5533
03:35:02,640 --> 03:35:04,240
I don't think they were dead.

5534
03:35:07,570 --> 03:35:08,310
Oh, they were dead.

5535
03:35:08,530 --> 03:35:08,890
Just kidding.

5536
03:35:09,250 --> 03:35:09,900
They were dead.

5537
03:35:14,670 --> 03:35:16,270
Oh my god.

5538
03:35:18,230 --> 03:35:20,770
Oh my god.

5539
03:35:21,630 --> 03:35:23,230
At least me, my job.

5540
03:35:24,950 --> 03:35:25,670
We lived.

5541
03:35:26,490 --> 03:35:27,630
Freerun blessed you.

5542
03:35:27,850 --> 03:35:29,170
She gave you her blessings.

5543
03:35:29,850 --> 03:35:31,650
I didn't think I was going to make it, I'll be honest.

5544
03:35:31,830 --> 03:35:32,390
I was so scared.

5545
03:35:34,790 --> 03:35:36,330
Oh my god.

5546
03:35:38,030 --> 03:35:38,430
519.

5547
03:35:39,750 --> 03:35:40,330
How much is...

5548
03:35:40,890 --> 03:35:42,270
We're so close.

5549
03:35:42,610 --> 03:35:45,350
If only we had gotten all of her, we would have made it.

5550
03:35:45,610 --> 03:35:46,030
No, no, no, no.

5551
03:35:46,190 --> 03:35:47,970
We could kill someone and sell their body.

5552
03:35:48,670 --> 03:35:50,210
But we also lose money, don't we?

5553
03:35:50,370 --> 03:35:50,950
Then too?

5554
03:35:54,190 --> 03:35:54,510
I

5555
03:35:59,520 --> 03:35:59,720
forgot.

5556
03:35:59,880 --> 03:36:01,780
I forgot how much you get from killing someone.

5557
03:36:02,180 --> 03:36:02,360
I don't know.

5558
03:36:03,220 --> 03:36:03,480
Really?

5559
03:36:03,840 --> 03:36:04,180
It's only five.

5560
03:36:05,100 --> 03:36:05,840
There is only five.

5561
03:36:06,240 --> 03:36:07,880
But how much you can sell body for.

5562
03:36:08,380 --> 03:36:10,820
Oh, some people said someone said we'll get overtime bonus.

5563
03:36:10,940 --> 03:36:11,960
So we might actually make it.

5564
03:36:12,720 --> 03:36:13,000
Oh.

5565
03:36:13,140 --> 03:36:13,300
Oh.

5566
03:36:13,560 --> 03:36:14,040
Yeah.

5567
03:36:14,600 --> 03:36:14,860
Okay.

5568
03:36:15,360 --> 03:36:15,400
Okay.

5569
03:36:15,500 --> 03:36:15,680
Okay.

5570
03:36:16,020 --> 03:36:16,240
Nice.

5571
03:36:16,520 --> 03:36:16,520
Nice.

5572
03:36:16,740 --> 03:36:17,140
I believe.

5573
03:36:17,300 --> 03:36:17,480
I believe.

5574
03:36:17,540 --> 03:36:17,680
Okay.

5575
03:36:18,180 --> 03:36:19,700
Oh, you only get five.

5576
03:36:20,480 --> 03:36:23,400
Oh, it's only five dollars.

5577
03:36:23,520 --> 03:36:24,200
Okay, that's nothing.

5578
03:36:24,680 --> 03:36:24,680
Yeah.

5579
03:36:25,220 --> 03:36:26,180
Never mind.

5580
03:36:26,660 --> 03:36:27,480
Never mind.

5581
03:36:28,080 --> 03:36:28,740
Never mind.

5582
03:36:29,200 --> 03:36:30,660
I can't believe.

5583
03:36:31,060 --> 03:36:32,080
Humans are worthless.

5584
03:36:33,300 --> 03:36:34,420
Humans are worthless.

5585
03:36:35,740 --> 03:36:38,380
Am I good?

5586
03:36:39,580 --> 03:36:42,180
Am I streaming?

5587
03:36:44,960 --> 03:36:45,820
I'm back?

5588
03:36:46,300 --> 03:36:46,420
Okay.

5589
03:36:47,120 --> 03:36:49,800
Oh, the- the...

5590
03:36:49,940 --> 03:36:53,220
I had a...

5591
03:36:53,220 --> 03:36:53,740
Oh,

5592
03:36:57,580 --> 03:36:57,820
watch out!

5593
03:36:57,940 --> 03:36:58,220
Watch out!

5594
03:36:58,260 --> 03:36:59,740
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

5595
03:36:59,740 --> 03:37:01,000
Alright, go, okay, go, go, okay, good.

5596
03:37:01,240 --> 03:37:01,980
Goodbye, free rent.

5597
03:37:07,760 --> 03:37:08,560
Free rent!

5598
03:37:08,560 --> 03:37:10,520
Bye, free rent!

5599
03:37:10,520 --> 03:37:10,620
Buy!

5600
03:37:10,620 --> 03:37:11,460
Oh, that was fun!

5601
03:37:11,880 --> 03:37:13,060
She'll have free rent 있�!

5602
03:37:13,080 --> 03:37:14,040
Free rent!

5603
03:37:15,240 --> 03:37:17,900
We had to sell her, you guys, we had to sell her.

5604
03:37:18,060 --> 03:37:19,380
She was worth a lot of money.

5605
03:37:22,380 --> 03:37:23,180
Desperate times!

5606
03:37:24,120 --> 03:37:24,660
Desperate measures!

5607
03:37:25,540 --> 03:37:25,720
Desperate times!

5608
03:37:25,740 --> 03:37:27,360
How much did we make?

5609
03:37:27,680 --> 03:37:28,420
Look, everything.

5610
03:37:28,620 --> 03:37:29,180
I think so.

5611
03:37:29,420 --> 03:37:30,060
We got 300.

5612
03:37:31,480 --> 03:37:33,420
We got 371.

5613
03:37:34,680 --> 03:37:35,460
Ding, ding, ding.

5614
03:37:41,240 --> 03:37:42,360
Oh, okay, nice.

5615
03:37:43,520 --> 03:37:44,000
Okay.

5616
03:37:45,620 --> 03:37:46,380
One in here.

5617
03:37:48,140 --> 03:37:49,700
How much did we get?

5618
03:37:49,700 --> 03:37:49,980
Okay.

5619
03:37:50,520 --> 03:37:51,360
How much are we at?

5620
03:37:51,540 --> 03:37:52,100
We have.

5621
03:37:52,380 --> 03:37:53,020
Okay, okay, key.

5622
03:37:53,540 --> 03:37:54,680
Overtime bonus, over time bonus.

5623
03:37:55,460 --> 03:37:56,900
We're so close.

5624
03:37:57,100 --> 03:37:57,780
We're so close.

5625
03:37:57,980 --> 03:37:58,540
Oh my gosh.

5626
03:37:58,740 --> 03:37:59,320
Wait, wait.

5627
03:37:59,380 --> 03:38:00,780
We have to wait for the overtime bonus.

5628
03:38:00,860 --> 03:38:01,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5629
03:38:01,720 --> 03:38:03,620
So once I think we take off, then we'll be good.

5630
03:38:03,700 --> 03:38:04,780
I think we're gonna make it.

5631
03:38:04,800 --> 03:38:05,400
Okay, fingers crossed.

5632
03:38:06,240 --> 03:38:06,580
Let's go!

5633
03:38:07,160 --> 03:38:07,760
Let's go!

5634
03:38:10,760 --> 03:38:11,140
Let's go!

5635
03:38:11,140 --> 03:38:12,960
Yes, he got this from Florida, right?

5636
03:38:14,180 --> 03:38:14,580
Yeah.

5637
03:38:14,880 --> 03:38:16,660
I actually get it.

5638
03:38:17,680 --> 03:38:18,360
I hope so.

5639
03:38:18,480 --> 03:38:18,720
Okay.

5640
03:38:19,820 --> 03:38:20,760
There should be.

5641
03:38:21,640 --> 03:38:21,980
Okay.

5642
03:38:24,100 --> 03:38:26,720
Oh, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

5643
03:38:28,200 --> 03:38:28,720
Oh.

5644
03:38:32,300 --> 03:38:32,780
Okay.

5645
03:38:33,120 --> 03:38:33,560
Yeah!

5646
03:38:33,840 --> 03:38:34,900
She was like, she too!

5647
03:38:36,220 --> 03:38:37,960
Can we make it?

5648
03:38:38,840 --> 03:38:39,280
Yes!

5649
03:38:39,800 --> 03:38:41,080
We can go to Rend!

5650
03:38:41,500 --> 03:38:42,480
We can go to Rend!

5651
03:38:43,900 --> 03:38:44,720
Let's go!

5652
03:38:45,840 --> 03:38:47,240
Oh, what did I read?

5653
03:38:47,400 --> 03:38:47,760
Wait.

5654
03:38:50,140 --> 03:38:53,300
All right, last run, last run?

5655
03:38:53,520 --> 03:38:54,240
Yeah, last run.

5656
03:38:54,880 --> 03:38:54,960
Yeah, last run.

5657
03:38:56,300 --> 03:38:57,180
All right.

5658
03:38:57,700 --> 03:39:02,060
All right, and Rend had, like, it wasn't it wasn't eclipsed
or anything, so we're good.

5659
03:39:02,200 --> 03:39:02,840
Okay, good, good, good.

5660
03:39:03,040 --> 03:39:03,820
Oh, nice, nice.

5661
03:39:03,820 --> 03:39:04,480
Let's go here.

5662
03:39:04,840 --> 03:39:05,160
Hi.

5663
03:39:06,760 --> 03:39:07,720
Let's go!

5664
03:39:07,740 --> 03:39:08,540
So happy!

5665
03:39:08,880 --> 03:39:09,360
Yeah!

5666
03:39:10,240 --> 03:39:12,240
We've been there.

5667
03:39:12,280 --> 03:39:13,580
It did so well.

5668
03:39:14,300 --> 03:39:14,600
Ooh!

5669
03:39:15,160 --> 03:39:16,640
You, you, you, you.

5670
03:39:16,660 --> 03:39:17,480
You, you, you.

5671
03:39:18,060 --> 03:39:18,780
Nice by friend.

5672
03:39:20,220 --> 03:39:20,340
Yeah!

5673
03:39:20,340 --> 03:39:21,100
Oh, I'm so excited!

5674
03:39:22,060 --> 03:39:22,240
Oh!

5675
03:39:23,540 --> 03:39:23,760
Wow!

5676
03:39:26,490 --> 03:39:28,650
Alright guys, just follow the lights.

5677
03:39:29,110 --> 03:39:30,570
Yeah, just follow the lights.

5678
03:39:31,370 --> 03:39:32,550
All right, here we go.

5679
03:39:32,750 --> 03:39:33,770
Here we go, everyone!

5680
03:39:34,770 --> 03:39:35,670
Follow the lights!

5681
03:39:39,190 --> 03:39:40,090
Follow the lights!

5682
03:39:40,490 --> 03:39:40,510
Follow the lights!

5683
03:39:41,850 --> 03:39:43,190
Hopefully it's a mansion.

5684
03:39:43,370 --> 03:39:44,530
I work in Lush, right?

5685
03:39:45,350 --> 03:39:45,890
Fingers crossed.

5686
03:39:46,150 --> 03:39:46,430
Yeah.

5687
03:39:47,530 --> 03:39:49,330
Oh, uh, just, uh, it's up here.

5688
03:39:49,450 --> 03:39:50,950
It's up here.

5689
03:39:51,730 --> 03:39:52,210
Wait.

5690
03:39:52,730 --> 03:39:52,850
Yeah, yeah.

5691
03:39:53,010 --> 03:39:53,150
Right here.

5692
03:39:53,610 --> 03:39:54,230
Yeah, yeah.

5693
03:39:54,230 --> 03:39:54,630
Here's the door.

5694
03:39:54,910 --> 03:39:55,150
Over here.

5695
03:39:55,410 --> 03:39:55,530
On.

5696
03:39:55,950 --> 03:39:56,150
All right.

5697
03:39:56,610 --> 03:39:57,190
All right.

5698
03:39:58,670 --> 03:39:59,090
Yeah.

5699
03:40:03,130 --> 03:40:04,270
We made it.

5700
03:40:04,710 --> 03:40:04,750
Goku.

5701
03:40:06,870 --> 03:40:08,170
It's actually more creepy.

5702
03:40:08,350 --> 03:40:08,870
Oh my god.

5703
03:40:09,070 --> 03:40:09,890
I'm not giving it.

5704
03:40:09,890 --> 03:40:10,530
I'm not giving it.

5705
03:40:10,550 --> 03:40:12,530
I'm not giving up on you.

5706
03:40:16,450 --> 03:40:18,310
What is so cool though?

5707
03:40:18,430 --> 03:40:20,870
There's scarier monsters in here though, so be careful.

5708
03:40:21,370 --> 03:40:21,470
Yeah.

5709
03:40:21,590 --> 03:40:21,970
Yeah.

5710
03:40:22,970 --> 03:40:24,650
I think there's some new ones too.

5711
03:40:24,890 --> 03:40:26,330
Yeah, we still haven't seen the new guy.

5712
03:40:26,770 --> 03:40:28,590
Maybe because we haven't, we have to come here.

5713
03:40:28,670 --> 03:40:30,290
I think they're here, yeah, yeah.

5714
03:40:32,910 --> 03:40:33,090
Yeah.

5715
03:40:33,090 --> 03:40:34,230
There's the door over here too, right?

5716
03:40:35,210 --> 03:40:35,890
Yeah, yeah.

5717
03:40:36,510 --> 03:40:36,750
Yeah.

5718
03:40:38,270 --> 03:40:39,670
And then another one.

5719
03:40:39,870 --> 03:40:40,650
Oh, there's a hairbrush.

5720
03:40:40,850 --> 03:40:41,710
And another one?

5721
03:40:42,210 --> 03:40:42,530
Nice.

5722
03:40:42,970 --> 03:40:45,190
Oh, I hear a cat!

5723
03:40:45,730 --> 03:40:46,350
Oh, I'm back!

5724
03:40:49,800 --> 03:40:52,020
We have been seeing a cat for so long, actually.

5725
03:40:52,400 --> 03:40:54,360
Oh my god, he's so cute!

5726
03:40:55,380 --> 03:40:55,900
It's...

5727
03:40:57,140 --> 03:40:58,200
What's your name?

5728
03:40:58,540 --> 03:40:59,320
It's Kiki!

5729
03:41:00,480 --> 03:41:02,060
Oh my god, Kiki!

5730
03:41:02,920 --> 03:41:05,000
Kiki's purring, he's so cute!

5731
03:41:05,360 --> 03:41:05,880
Kiki!

5732
03:41:06,400 --> 03:41:07,640
Oh, cute, Kiki!

5733
03:41:07,960 --> 03:41:11,420
Oh yes, oh yes, flip that cat, flip him, flip him.

5734
03:41:11,440 --> 03:41:13,940
We had to go back so rough when you're like, I know.

5735
03:41:14,360 --> 03:41:15,840
You're pulling on the tail.

5736
03:41:16,340 --> 03:41:17,620
You're stroking it.

5737
03:41:18,560 --> 03:41:19,400
Okay, nice.

5738
03:41:20,120 --> 03:41:22,180
I think everywhere else is a dead end over here.

5739
03:41:22,260 --> 03:41:23,460
Cat acquired.

5740
03:41:23,740 --> 03:41:24,460
We have won.

5741
03:41:26,180 --> 03:41:28,000
Friendship ended with Oliver.

5742
03:41:28,300 --> 03:41:29,780
Kiki's my new best friend.

5743
03:41:30,100 --> 03:41:31,920
I think I'm gonna put it outside.

5744
03:41:32,420 --> 03:41:33,140
I'm gonna run away.

5745
03:41:33,280 --> 03:41:34,620
Oliver wasn't worth it.

5746
03:41:34,740 --> 03:41:36,120
Maybe just put him by the door right here.

5747
03:41:37,560 --> 03:41:37,820
Oh.

5748
03:41:39,560 --> 03:41:41,840
Well, hopefully we see Kiki again.

5749
03:41:47,840 --> 03:41:51,400
I hope Kiki is not domesticated so that he doesn't...

5750
03:41:51,920 --> 03:41:51,980
Yeah.

5751
03:41:52,420 --> 03:41:54,080
So he belongs in the wild.

5752
03:41:56,300 --> 03:41:57,320
Let's see up here.

5753
03:41:57,420 --> 03:41:58,960
Okay, safe up there.

5754
03:41:59,280 --> 03:41:59,700
There's better out there.

5755
03:41:59,720 --> 03:42:00,540
Oh, there's the one here.

5756
03:42:00,900 --> 03:42:01,500
Different doors.

5757
03:42:02,480 --> 03:42:03,200
Travel doors.

5758
03:42:04,200 --> 03:42:04,340
Oh?

5759
03:42:04,880 --> 03:42:06,040
Wait, did I hear someone talk?

5760
03:42:07,420 --> 03:42:07,840
Oh.

5761
03:42:08,520 --> 03:42:08,840
Oh.

5762
03:42:09,520 --> 03:42:09,660
Oh.

5763
03:42:09,900 --> 03:42:10,360
Oh.

5764
03:42:10,740 --> 03:42:12,800
There we go.

5765
03:42:12,980 --> 03:42:14,560
I think we're all clicking on it.

5766
03:42:14,920 --> 03:42:15,500
There we go.

5767
03:42:16,360 --> 03:42:16,920
Silly.

5768
03:42:17,560 --> 03:42:18,420
Um, dead end.

5769
03:42:19,220 --> 03:42:19,940
Dead end.

5770
03:42:21,300 --> 03:42:22,020
Nothing here.

5771
03:42:22,160 --> 03:42:23,080
Go back.

5772
03:42:23,320 --> 03:42:24,400
Nothing here.

5773
03:42:26,140 --> 03:42:26,760
The door over here.

5774
03:42:26,980 --> 03:42:27,560
The other way.

5775
03:42:27,640 --> 03:42:28,300
Over here.

5776
03:42:30,840 --> 03:42:33,160
Well, if there's nothing here, then it's just key, I guess.

5777
03:42:33,540 --> 03:42:34,240
And the hairbrush.

5778
03:42:34,740 --> 03:42:36,000
We can always come back.

5779
03:42:36,160 --> 03:42:38,760
We can, like, so we don't have to pay for it again since
we're all...

5780
03:42:38,760 --> 03:42:39,980
Okay, I'll go this way.

5781
03:42:40,880 --> 03:42:41,640
Is it a loop?

5782
03:42:42,080 --> 03:42:42,160
Yes.

5783
03:42:42,560 --> 03:42:43,300
Oh, red.

5784
03:42:44,220 --> 03:42:45,560
Why is there a lot of doors?

5785
03:42:47,260 --> 03:42:47,720
What?

5786
03:42:48,220 --> 03:42:49,180
I heard something.

5787
03:42:49,900 --> 03:42:51,780
I think Ayla Sama might die.

5788
03:42:51,900 --> 03:42:53,260
I heard...

5789
03:42:53,260 --> 03:42:54,240
Uh...

5790
03:42:54,240 --> 03:42:54,880
Ayla Sama?

5791
03:42:55,080 --> 03:42:55,300
Wait!

5792
03:42:55,700 --> 03:42:57,280
She's dead, everybody.

5793
03:42:58,020 --> 03:42:59,020
How did you die?

5794
03:42:59,420 --> 03:43:00,580
Um, there was a...

5795
03:43:00,580 --> 03:43:04,060
She goes, ooh, red carpet and then died to a trap.

5796
03:43:06,660 --> 03:43:08,240
So, just be careful.

5797
03:43:08,420 --> 03:43:09,080
There's some...

5798
03:43:09,080 --> 03:43:12,260
There's some traps around, you know?

5799
03:43:14,100 --> 03:43:14,700
Okay.

5800
03:43:14,840 --> 03:43:16,040
There's a red carpet scary.

5801
03:43:16,560 --> 03:43:17,040
Yeah.

5802
03:43:17,260 --> 03:43:26,400
Oh my god, I can see her dangling body shadow is so scary.

5803
03:43:27,880 --> 03:43:28,980
Oh my gosh.

5804
03:43:30,320 --> 03:43:31,460
It's so scary.

5805
03:43:33,880 --> 03:43:35,780
Oh my god, it's so scary.

5806
03:43:37,120 --> 03:43:39,700
The shadow is so scary.

5807
03:43:40,780 --> 03:43:44,420
Oh my god.

5808
03:44:00,460 --> 03:44:01,500
Hello, it's me!

5809
03:44:01,660 --> 03:44:02,320
I'm real!

5810
03:44:03,580 --> 03:44:03,960
I'm real!

5811
03:44:05,060 --> 03:44:05,660
Is she real?

5812
03:44:05,860 --> 03:44:06,780
Yes, I'm real!

5813
03:44:06,980 --> 03:44:08,200
I'm real!

5814
03:44:12,450 --> 03:44:13,950
Wait, this one, oh wait, what's that?

5815
03:44:17,500 --> 03:44:18,640
Oh, the fireplace room.

5816
03:44:19,480 --> 03:44:21,020
Uh-oh, I hear the ambiance again.

5817
03:44:21,640 --> 03:44:23,840
The ambiance is starting again.

5818
03:44:24,460 --> 03:44:24,800
Hello?

5819
03:44:30,220 --> 03:44:31,820
Oh, I don't like the mansion.

5820
03:44:32,240 --> 03:44:32,980
Scares me by myself.

5821
03:44:34,020 --> 03:44:34,580
Wait, ah!

5822
03:44:35,580 --> 03:44:36,060
Wait!

5823
03:44:36,760 --> 03:44:37,020
Hello?

5824
03:44:42,750 --> 03:44:44,490
Oh, there's the ambience.

5825
03:44:46,710 --> 03:44:47,630
What is it?

5826
03:44:47,730 --> 03:44:48,830
What is it you guys think?

5827
03:44:49,490 --> 03:44:51,170
Do you think it's... Goku?

5828
03:45:04,360 --> 03:45:04,900
Goku!

5829
03:45:12,720 --> 03:45:14,060
Oh, I'm back here.

5830
03:45:15,940 --> 03:45:16,880
Uh, this way.

5831
03:45:18,400 --> 03:45:18,940
This way.

5832
03:45:19,380 --> 03:45:20,140
Nice, nice, nice.

5833
03:45:24,280 --> 03:45:24,820
Okay.

5834
03:45:26,800 --> 03:45:28,540
So we just got a little Bracken...

5835
03:45:34,000 --> 03:45:35,760
Wait, do I have a girl?

5836
03:45:36,720 --> 03:45:38,320
Where's the music coming from?

5837
03:45:41,260 --> 03:45:42,020
Where's the girl?

5838
03:45:42,680 --> 03:45:44,660
Where's the music coming from?

5839
03:45:44,940 --> 03:45:45,380
Hello?

5840
03:45:47,140 --> 03:45:48,480
Are you guys outside?

5841
03:45:52,650 --> 03:45:53,670
No, it is me!

5842
03:45:53,830 --> 03:45:54,110
It's me!

5843
03:45:54,270 --> 03:45:54,590
It's me!

5844
03:46:01,020 --> 03:46:03,740
The Bracken is ch- What was that?

5845
03:46:03,960 --> 03:46:06,280
I just heard someone laugh!

5846
03:46:06,400 --> 03:46:07,080
Oh, where are you?

5847
03:46:07,560 --> 03:46:08,560
Oh, hello?

5848
03:46:08,780 --> 03:46:09,060
Hello?

5849
03:46:09,640 --> 03:46:10,520
Oh, that's not heard!

5850
03:46:10,620 --> 03:46:11,060
That's not heard!

5851
03:46:14,580 --> 03:46:15,040
What?

5852
03:46:16,700 --> 03:46:18,040
They sounded so close.

5853
03:46:21,180 --> 03:46:21,900
What's that?

5854
03:46:22,860 --> 03:46:23,400
Hello?

5855
03:46:26,420 --> 03:46:27,580
What's that sound?

5856
03:46:30,400 --> 03:46:31,480
What's that thump?

5857
03:46:33,320 --> 03:46:34,700
Oh, it's a jester?

5858
03:46:35,060 --> 03:46:35,420
Oh god.

5859
03:46:36,160 --> 03:46:36,860
It's the jester?

5860
03:46:38,120 --> 03:46:41,700
We are so...

5861
03:46:42,700 --> 03:46:44,080
Wait, wait.

5862
03:46:44,080 --> 03:46:44,460
Kiki!

5863
03:46:46,520 --> 03:46:46,880
Uh-oh.

5864
03:47:40,960 --> 03:47:42,160
Oh my god.

5865
03:47:42,160 --> 03:47:42,820
Oh my god.

5866
03:47:43,120 --> 03:47:45,280
Oh my god.

5867
03:47:45,280 --> 03:47:46,460
Oh my god.

5868
03:47:48,820 --> 03:47:50,480
I thought it was a dog.

5869
03:48:03,200 --> 03:48:08,680
that's not you that's not you at all oh my

5870
03:48:14,460 --> 03:48:23,560

5872
03:48:41,420 --> 03:48:45,880

something behind me and I was like, oh my gosh, a dog is

5873
03:48:45,880 --> 03:48:48,140
following me and the cat is going to like, is crying.

5874
03:48:48,500 --> 03:48:52,000
And then I turn around and I saw one of you and I think it
had everybody's voice.

5875
03:48:52,180 --> 03:48:53,880
And I was like, oh my God, it's just you.

5876
03:48:54,560 --> 03:49:02,280
And so, but then I got to the car, I got to the ship and the
dog attacked the mimic at the last second and saved me.

5877
03:49:02,800 --> 03:49:04,440
I was like, it was following you.

5878
03:49:04,480 --> 03:49:06,120
It was following me.

5879
03:49:06,820 --> 03:49:07,180
What?

5880
03:49:07,860 --> 03:49:09,000
Oh my God.

5881
03:49:09,340 --> 03:49:11,000

I got distracted by the...

Yeah, I know.

5892
03:49:54,480 --> 03:49:55,080
It was so shiny.

Oh my gosh.

5894
03:50:00,220 --> 03:50:01,320
Do you want to try it again?

5895
03:50:01,500 --> 03:50:02,560
Do you want to try Renn again?

03:50:03,080 --> 03:50:03,480
Yeah.

5897
03:50:04,520 --> 03:50:05,820
Yeah, let's go back, okay.

5898
03:50:07,520 --> 03:50:07,920
Woo.

5899
03:50:08,400 --> 03:50:09,340
Now that we're here.

5900
03:50:09,740 --> 03:50:11,140
Oh my gosh, that was so freaky.

5901
03:50:11,420 --> 03:50:13,540
That was so crazy timing.

5902
03:50:13,720 --> 03:50:15,340
I thought it was one of you.

5903
03:50:15,480 --> 03:50:16,900
Oh my gosh, I was fooled.

5904
03:50:17,200 --> 03:50:18,220
I was entirely duped.

5905
03:50:18,680 --> 03:50:19,900
I didn't know it follows you back.

5906
03:50:20,080 --> 03:50:20,580
Yeah, it does.

5907
03:50:20,660 --> 03:50:21,780
They follow you all the way here.

5908
03:50:22,520 --> 03:50:23,300
That's crazy.

5909
03:50:24,560 --> 03:50:25,960
It's very scary.

5910
03:50:26,460 --> 03:50:26,780
Oh.

5911
03:50:27,400 --> 03:50:29,240
Riding us like you are cruelly.

5912
03:50:31,000 --> 03:50:32,520
Okay, let's go.

5913
03:50:35,350 --> 03:50:37,090
Oh my gosh, thank you, Lord Croesus.

5914
03:50:49,220 --> 03:50:50,240
Are you here?

5915
03:50:50,720 --> 03:50:51,120
Yes.

5916
03:50:51,380 --> 03:50:51,960
Wait, where is it?

5917
03:50:52,020 --> 03:50:52,200
Over here?

5918
03:50:52,220 --> 03:50:54,900
Oh, oh, oh, here it is.

5919
03:50:55,420 --> 03:50:58,300
I always can't remember where it...

5920
03:50:58,300 --> 03:51:00,300
I wonder where the fire exit is for this.

5921
03:51:00,480 --> 03:51:01,380
Oh, if there is one.

5922
03:51:01,420 --> 03:51:02,600
Oh, there's Freddy!

5923
03:51:03,340 --> 03:51:05,320
Oh, my gosh, Freddy faster!

5924
03:51:06,060 --> 03:51:06,940
Freddy faster!

5925
03:51:10,140 --> 03:51:11,400
Wait, what else am I carrying?

5926
03:51:11,500 --> 03:51:12,940
Oh, the hairbrush, I forgot to put it down.

5927
03:51:14,120 --> 03:51:15,640
Magic 7-Ball!

5928
03:51:16,020 --> 03:51:16,420
Whoa!

5929
03:51:18,200 --> 03:51:19,420
It doesn't do anything.

5930
03:51:19,580 --> 03:51:20,560
Oh, there's something there.

5931
03:51:20,560 --> 03:51:22,120
Watch out for traps.

5932
03:51:22,220 --> 03:51:24,080
Oh yeah, true, true, true.

5933
03:51:24,640 --> 03:51:24,940
Yes.

5934
03:51:25,280 --> 03:51:26,180
Ew, that carpet!

5935
03:51:26,960 --> 03:51:28,760
Oh, it's locked.

5936
03:51:28,980 --> 03:51:29,640
Oh, it's locked.

5937
03:51:29,940 --> 03:51:30,460
Oh, really?

5938
03:51:31,340 --> 03:51:32,020
Go back.

5939
03:51:33,420 --> 03:51:36,920
Yeah, you get some of the more really crazy monsters in
here.

5940
03:51:36,920 --> 03:51:38,920
Tell us where we should go.

5941
03:51:40,600 --> 03:51:41,480
Out of the way.

5942
03:51:41,740 --> 03:51:44,220
Should I go this way?

5943
03:51:44,940 --> 03:51:45,980
Should I go up?

5944
03:51:46,020 --> 03:51:47,200
I'm going this way.

5945
03:51:47,820 --> 03:51:48,340
Oh!

5946
03:51:48,820 --> 03:51:50,120
Oh, sorry, that was me.

5947
03:51:50,340 --> 03:51:51,300
Oh, what the heck?

5948
03:51:51,540 --> 03:51:51,740
Oh, what the heck?

5949
03:51:53,160 --> 03:51:53,640
Emily.

5950
03:51:54,620 --> 03:51:54,900
Hello.

5951
03:51:55,320 --> 03:51:56,220
Oh, brass bell!

5952
03:51:57,280 --> 03:51:58,380
Wait, oh, I got it.

5953
03:51:58,560 --> 03:51:59,020
Oh, nah.

5954
03:51:59,380 --> 03:52:00,100
It's just a, oh.

5955
03:52:00,260 --> 03:52:02,280
I don't think there's anything else in here.

5956
03:52:03,760 --> 03:52:04,560
I'm kind of scared.

5957
03:52:04,820 --> 03:52:04,940
Nah.

5958
03:52:06,140 --> 03:52:06,860
You go off?

5959
03:52:07,420 --> 03:52:12,900
Oh, there's another door over here, but I think it's been
open.

5960
03:52:17,600 --> 03:52:18,900
It's beautiful night.

5961
03:52:19,820 --> 03:52:21,940
Oh, perfume bottle.

5962
03:52:22,220 --> 03:52:24,700
Oh, nice.

5963
03:52:24,920 --> 03:52:25,200
Oh, wait.

5964
03:52:25,880 --> 03:52:26,020
Whoa.

5965
03:52:26,920 --> 03:52:27,560
There's two things here.

5966
03:52:27,700 --> 03:52:30,180
Oh, I got a key if we want to open that other door.

5967
03:52:30,400 --> 03:52:31,340
Oh, true, true, true.

5968
03:52:31,880 --> 03:52:32,500
I'm not key.

5969
03:52:32,620 --> 03:52:33,340
Key kettle.

5970
03:52:33,500 --> 03:52:34,240
Oh, there's a kettle.

5971
03:52:34,600 --> 03:52:35,160
Oh, there's a kettle.

5972
03:52:35,540 --> 03:52:35,840
No.

5973
03:52:36,420 --> 03:52:37,320
Are you guys upstairs?

5974
03:52:37,540 --> 03:52:38,760
I'm not too loose this time.

5975
03:52:41,360 --> 03:52:42,500
I hear something.

5976
03:52:43,320 --> 03:52:44,040
I do, too.

5977
03:52:44,680 --> 03:52:45,220
What do you hear?

5978
03:52:46,620 --> 03:52:48,260
Oh, what is that?

5979
03:52:48,360 --> 03:52:48,560
Oh, boo.

5980
03:52:50,040 --> 03:52:51,040
Oh, she spoke this.

5981
03:52:52,620 --> 03:52:54,220
I'm good at that.

5982
03:52:56,220 --> 03:52:58,560
The other direction?

5983
03:52:59,660 --> 03:53:01,080
Yeah, we can check the locked door.

5984
03:53:02,200 --> 03:53:02,760
Was it this way?

5985
03:53:03,300 --> 03:53:04,580
I think it was downstairs, right?

5986
03:53:04,740 --> 03:53:05,500
Yeah, it was downstairs.

5987
03:53:06,840 --> 03:53:07,880
Was it this one?

5988
03:53:10,540 --> 03:53:11,660
Yeah, it was over here.

5989
03:53:13,280 --> 03:53:16,580
I left it over there.

5990
03:53:17,400 --> 03:53:17,680
Okay.

5991
03:53:20,420 --> 03:53:20,960
Let's go.

5992
03:53:21,480 --> 03:53:21,820
Oh.

5993
03:53:22,220 --> 03:53:23,160
Another door.

5994
03:53:23,260 --> 03:53:23,720
Wow.

5995
03:53:23,720 --> 03:53:25,100
Another locked door.

5996
03:53:25,640 --> 03:53:25,860
Wow.

5997
03:53:26,360 --> 03:53:26,640
Wow.

5998
03:53:26,920 --> 03:53:26,940
Wow.

5999
03:53:26,940 --> 03:53:27,720
So many doors.

6000
03:53:29,300 --> 03:53:29,500
Wow.

6001
03:53:29,840 --> 03:53:31,160
Big discovery, guys.

6002
03:53:31,840 --> 03:53:32,800
Nice going.

6003
03:53:33,060 --> 03:53:33,260
Let's go.

6004
03:53:33,260 --> 03:53:34,300
Another door behind.

6005
03:53:34,500 --> 03:53:35,060
Nice.

6006
03:53:35,800 --> 03:53:37,700
We got a good amount of loot.

6007
03:53:38,060 --> 03:53:38,360
Yeah.

6008
03:53:39,220 --> 03:53:40,300
Some outside, too.

6009
03:53:40,420 --> 03:53:41,060
Have we been here?

6010
03:53:42,840 --> 03:53:44,560
We know I'll put stuff outside, actually.

6011
03:53:45,060 --> 03:53:45,660
Yeah, yeah.

6012
03:53:45,940 --> 03:53:46,540
What was that?

6013
03:53:47,060 --> 03:53:47,380
Uh-oh.

6014
03:53:47,440 --> 03:53:49,560
I think it's the voice thing.

6015
03:53:49,640 --> 03:53:50,100
No, no.

6016
03:53:50,240 --> 03:53:52,200
I think I hear the guy.

6017
03:53:52,220 --> 03:53:54,100
I, um, the nutcracker.

6018
03:53:55,120 --> 03:53:55,280
Oh.

6019
03:53:56,900 --> 03:53:57,600
The hoop?

6020
03:53:57,960 --> 03:54:00,160
If you see the nutcracker, don't move.

6021
03:54:00,980 --> 03:54:01,280
Really?

6022
03:54:01,520 --> 03:54:02,120
Oh, really?

6023
03:54:02,420 --> 03:54:02,720
Yeah.

6024
03:54:03,380 --> 03:54:05,060
I think he's up here.

6025
03:54:05,800 --> 03:54:06,300
Should we go?

6026
03:54:08,560 --> 03:54:09,700
Did Naki leave?

6027
03:54:09,720 --> 03:54:10,080
Where'd he go?

6028
03:54:12,120 --> 03:54:13,100
She went ahead.

6029
03:54:13,840 --> 03:54:15,140
I think she went outside.

6030
03:54:15,620 --> 03:54:15,780
Oh.

6031
03:54:16,720 --> 03:54:19,000
Alright, I'll grab the hairbrush.

6032
03:54:19,780 --> 03:54:20,300
Okay.

6033
03:54:22,220 --> 03:54:24,100
There's some items on the floor here too.

6034
03:54:24,220 --> 03:54:25,220
Oh, okay, I can grab them.

6035
03:54:25,800 --> 03:54:26,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6036
03:54:26,840 --> 03:54:27,720
And we can take them back.

6037
03:54:28,020 --> 03:54:28,240
All right.

6038
03:54:29,220 --> 03:54:29,560
Okay.

6039
03:54:30,340 --> 03:54:31,440
Here we go.

6040
03:54:31,760 --> 03:54:33,080
Follow the light.

6041
03:54:33,880 --> 03:54:35,160
We have eaten bean.

6042
03:54:38,760 --> 03:54:39,880
Following, following.

6043
03:54:40,440 --> 03:54:41,720
It's so windy.

6044
03:54:42,440 --> 03:54:43,680
Following the light.

6045
03:54:52,620 --> 03:54:53,980
I can't see anything in there.

6046
03:54:55,260 --> 03:54:56,340
Interesting though.

6047
03:54:57,280 --> 03:54:58,260
It's a little safe house.

6048
03:55:00,220 --> 03:55:01,500
Follow the light.

6049
03:55:01,720 --> 03:55:03,060
Usually they say don't follow the light.

6050
03:55:03,080 --> 03:55:03,760
She's not moving.

6051
03:55:04,220 --> 03:55:05,460
Yeah, she's not moving.

6052
03:55:05,740 --> 03:55:06,360
Wait, where is she?

6053
03:55:06,500 --> 03:55:07,400
Haki's not moving.

6054
03:55:08,200 --> 03:55:08,780
I don't know.

6055
03:55:10,100 --> 03:55:11,760
Wait, was the painting expensive?

6056
03:55:12,420 --> 03:55:13,260
Yeah, it was $100.

6057
03:55:13,260 --> 03:55:13,960
They usually are, yeah.

6058
03:55:14,560 --> 03:55:15,300
Whoa, whoa.

6059
03:55:15,720 --> 03:55:17,180
Wait, where did she leave from?

6060
03:55:19,040 --> 03:55:19,480
I...

6061
03:55:19,480 --> 03:55:20,540
Is this outside?

6062
03:55:21,020 --> 03:55:21,700
She's not moving.

6063
03:55:22,340 --> 03:55:22,840
I think it's outside.

6064
03:55:22,840 --> 03:55:24,020
Yeah, it looks like it's outside.

6065
03:55:25,160 --> 03:55:26,400
But how did she die?

6066
03:55:28,720 --> 03:55:29,720
I don't know.

6067
03:55:30,020 --> 03:55:31,260
We have a lot of money.

6068
03:55:31,420 --> 03:55:31,880
You want to go?

6069
03:55:32,020 --> 03:55:33,080
Or do you want to go look for her?

6070
03:55:34,100 --> 03:55:38,480
Like, we can probably go and then just come back again.

6071
03:55:39,120 --> 03:55:39,860
Yeah, yeah.

6072
03:55:40,280 --> 03:55:42,080
Oh, it could have been the ghost girl.

6073
03:55:43,380 --> 03:55:44,520
Oh, yeah.

6074
03:55:44,760 --> 03:55:45,900
I forgot about, like, the...

6075
03:55:45,900 --> 03:55:49,600
Oh, someone says it looks like she found the fire exit and
then fell.

6076
03:55:50,380 --> 03:55:51,140
Oh, fuck.

6077
03:55:52,900 --> 03:55:53,300
Whoopsie.

6078
03:55:54,740 --> 03:55:55,140
Whoopsie.

6079
03:55:56,580 --> 03:55:57,360
To hip it out.

6080
03:55:57,920 --> 03:56:00,000
Yeah, I think we could go and then just come back.

6081
03:56:00,020 --> 03:56:13,360
again we we looted a lot okay ghost girl i want to say the

03:56:32,760 --> 03:56:33,820
Welcome back.

6086
03:56:33,860 --> 03:56:38,020
I accidentally used Easter egg and it threw me...

6087
03:56:39,900 --> 03:56:42,000
Wait, it can do that?

6088
03:56:46,160 --> 03:56:47,420
It exploded!

6089
03:56:48,480 --> 03:56:51,180
Oh yeah, it'll explode sometimes, yeah.

6090
03:56:51,380 --> 03:56:52,540
Naki's gotcha pool.

6091
03:56:58,460 --> 03:56:58,800
Okay.

6092
03:56:59,660 --> 03:57:00,480
Last run.

6093
03:57:00,720 --> 03:57:02,300
Maybe that's what I died to last time.

6094
03:57:02,400 --> 03:57:03,380
I was carrying an Easter egg.

6095
03:57:03,400 --> 03:57:05,820
and I think it might have exploded on me just randomly.

6096
03:57:07,340 --> 03:57:07,940
I didn't know.

6097
03:57:08,300 --> 03:57:09,220
You explore yourself.

6098
03:57:09,420 --> 03:57:09,820
Oh, maybe.

6099
03:57:10,160 --> 03:57:11,020
Yeah, maybe that's what it was.

6100
03:57:11,580 --> 03:57:13,240
In case I don't come back.

6101
03:57:13,560 --> 03:57:14,600
Oh, that's what it was.

6102
03:57:15,640 --> 03:57:16,840
I love you, Kiki.

6103
03:57:17,020 --> 03:57:17,920
In case I don't come back.

6104
03:57:18,640 --> 03:57:19,200
See you later.

6105
03:57:34,880 --> 03:57:35,640
I'll be here.

6106
03:57:35,960 --> 03:57:36,140
Oh.

6107
03:57:36,840 --> 03:57:37,380
Yeah, yeah.

6108
03:57:37,580 --> 03:57:38,060
You gotta go up.

6109
03:57:38,600 --> 03:57:38,900
Wait.

6110
03:57:39,500 --> 03:57:39,840
Yeah, yeah.

6111
03:57:39,900 --> 03:57:40,140
You're right.

6112
03:57:40,260 --> 03:57:40,460
You're right.

6113
03:57:41,080 --> 03:57:41,420
All right.

6114
03:57:41,640 --> 03:57:41,820
All right.

6115
03:57:41,980 --> 03:57:42,280
Right here.

6116
03:57:42,380 --> 03:57:42,540
Right here.

6117
03:57:42,560 --> 03:57:43,260
Can I go too far?

6118
03:57:43,620 --> 03:57:44,220
Oh, it's here.

6119
03:57:44,900 --> 03:57:45,960
It's so hard to see.

6120
03:57:46,680 --> 03:57:49,400
Oh, man.

6121
03:57:49,740 --> 03:57:51,180
This is not a mansion.

6122
03:57:52,160 --> 03:57:54,160
Wait, there's a comedy mask somewhere.

6123
03:57:55,440 --> 03:57:56,640
Where is it?

6124
03:57:57,640 --> 03:57:58,520
I scanned it.

6125
03:57:58,700 --> 03:57:59,660
I scanned it.

6126
03:58:00,000 --> 03:58:00,620
Oh, oh, oh.

6127
03:58:01,560 --> 03:58:02,620
Where'd it go?

6128
03:58:02,980 --> 03:58:04,260
For a comedy.

6129
03:58:04,800 --> 03:58:06,220
Maybe it's like on a ledge.

6130
03:58:06,720 --> 03:58:07,040
Maybe.

6131
03:58:07,860 --> 03:58:08,460
Wait, where'd it go?

6132
03:58:08,640 --> 03:58:09,740
Wait, who picked it up?

6133
03:58:10,000 --> 03:58:11,220
Someone picked it up.

6134
03:58:11,880 --> 03:58:13,120

6135
03:58:13,400 --> 03:58:14,240

03:59:10,740 --> 03:59:11,880
Another maze.

6151
03:59:12,200 --> 03:59:13,060
Another maze.

6152
03:59:13,380 --> 03:59:15,080
Maze after maze after maze.

6153
03:59:16,960 --> 03:59:18,140

Oh.

6156
03:59:22,060 --> 03:59:25,500
No, I think- I think we can walk around it.

6157
03:59:26,620 --> 03:59:26,820
Maybe.

6158
03:59:27,620 --> 03:59:28,700
Sometimes we can.

6159
03:59:29,760 --> 03:59:30,280

6160
03:59:31,240 --> 03:59:31,720

Hello?

6167
03:59:36,440 --> 03:59:36,760
Hi.

6168
03:59:37,540 --> 03:59:39,140
Are we going in circles?

6169
03:59:39,780 --> 03:59:42,460
It's- Oh, there's a painting!

6170
03:59:43,120 --> 03:59:44,400
Oh, that's just somewhere near.

6171
03:59:44,400 --> 03:59:45,200
Wow, good job.

6172
03:59:45,520 --> 03:59:46,860
There's like nothing here.

6173
03:59:46,960 --> 03:59:47,540
Whoa.

6174
03:59:48,440 --> 03:59:49,440
But there's a painting.

6175
03:59:49,600 --> 03:59:50,380
That's where the lawn.

6176
03:59:50,660 --> 03:59:51,240
Yeah, usually.

6177
03:59:51,860 --> 03:59:52,060
Yeah.

6178
03:59:52,940 --> 03:59:53,040
Yeah.

6179
03:59:53,040 --> 03:59:54,860
All right, now we just gotta find a way out.

6180
03:59:55,020 --> 03:59:56,000
Oh, there's a key, yeah.

6181
03:59:56,240 --> 03:59:56,840
Oh, there's a key.

6182
03:59:57,500 --> 03:59:58,580
I might be grab it.

6183
03:59:58,860 --> 03:59:59,300
I got it.

6184
04:00:00,800 --> 04:00:01,920
It's so hard to see.

6185
04:00:03,660 --> 04:00:05,200
Can we go through this door?

6186
04:00:05,680 --> 04:00:06,880
I don't think we're going to.

6187
04:00:06,880 --> 04:00:07,360
Is that a chase here?

6188
04:00:08,540 --> 04:00:10,940
It looks a little foggy.

6189
04:00:11,760 --> 04:00:12,020
Yeah.

6190
04:00:12,160 --> 04:00:13,660
It looks a little foggy.

6191
04:00:16,420 --> 04:00:18,100
Nah, I don't think we want to here.

6192
04:00:19,800 --> 04:00:21,400
Um, I went in.

6193
04:00:21,600 --> 04:00:21,760
Whoa.

6194
04:00:22,460 --> 04:00:22,480
Ah.

6195
04:00:23,080 --> 04:00:24,960
Let's, maybe we can find the thing.

6196
04:00:26,360 --> 04:00:27,240
What's that sound?

6197
04:00:28,480 --> 04:00:30,180
Um, um, um, um, um.

6198
04:00:31,420 --> 04:00:32,400
I don't have to be good.

6199
04:00:34,020 --> 04:00:35,840
I turned it off!

6200
04:00:36,820 --> 04:00:37,680
Oh, nice!

6201
04:00:38,640 --> 04:00:39,960
Oh, good job, good job.

6202
04:00:40,180 --> 04:00:40,340
Cool.

6203
04:00:41,180 --> 04:00:42,580
Now I can't- Oh, no.

6204
04:00:43,900 --> 04:00:46,840
Uh, I think we're really- I think we're really lost.

6205
04:00:46,940 --> 04:00:48,280
I think we're really lost.

6206
04:00:49,440 --> 04:00:50,320
Uh oh.

6207
04:00:50,700 --> 04:00:52,040
Somewhere close.

6208
04:00:52,360 --> 04:00:53,200
Oh, there you are.

6209
04:00:53,260 --> 04:00:53,620
Are you loud?

6210
04:00:53,940 --> 04:00:55,000
Yeah, we've been following you.

6211
04:00:56,200 --> 04:00:56,380
One

6212
04:01:00,620 --> 04:01:00,800
second.

6213
04:01:00,940 --> 04:01:02,080
No, this is where we came from, right?

6214
04:01:02,500 --> 04:01:02,960
Over here?

6215
04:01:04,080 --> 04:01:04,520
Maybe.

6216
04:01:04,540 --> 04:01:06,440
I was going back to find you guys.

6217
04:01:06,680 --> 04:01:07,520
Oh, oh.

6218
04:01:07,880 --> 04:01:08,320
Maybe.

6219
04:01:08,660 --> 04:01:09,800
Oh, there's a dead end here.

6220
04:01:09,920 --> 04:01:10,080
Haha.

6221
04:01:12,360 --> 04:01:17,140
Yeah, it sure looks like the area we looked around earlier.

6222
04:01:17,520 --> 04:01:17,920
No.

6223
04:01:18,580 --> 04:01:20,140
I knew that was a dead end.

6224
04:01:20,160 --> 04:01:21,020
I was just confirming.

6225
04:01:22,860 --> 04:01:23,280
Here!

6226
04:01:23,860 --> 04:01:24,020
Oh!

6227
04:01:24,820 --> 04:01:26,600
That's where we came from?

6228
04:01:26,960 --> 04:01:27,200
Oh!

6229
04:01:27,400 --> 04:01:28,260
No, there's two.

6230
04:01:29,120 --> 04:01:29,440
Oh!

6231
04:01:33,340 --> 04:01:35,540
Maybe we can just go back where we came from.

6232
04:01:35,560 --> 04:01:36,800
Can we even go back?

6233
04:01:37,220 --> 04:01:39,340
I don't even know how to...

6234
04:01:39,340 --> 04:01:40,560
Got some bottles?

6235
04:01:43,300 --> 04:01:44,180
New area.

6236
04:01:45,600 --> 04:01:46,520
They're not gonna follow?

6237
04:01:48,180 --> 04:01:49,520
Trust your nose.

6238
04:01:51,000 --> 04:01:52,380
Oh, hair dryer!

6239
04:01:53,780 --> 04:01:54,560
Big bolt?

6240
04:01:55,120 --> 04:01:55,620
Oh, there's a lot here.

6241
04:01:58,980 --> 04:01:59,520
Are you real?

6242
04:02:01,020 --> 04:02:01,900
Oh, there you go.

6243
04:02:02,540 --> 04:02:03,420
Are you real?

6244
04:02:04,740 --> 04:02:05,100
Oh, hello.

6245
04:02:05,920 --> 04:02:07,340
Yeah, yeah, I thought you weren't.

6246
04:02:07,700 --> 04:02:08,580
Nice, nice, nice.

6247
04:02:08,640 --> 04:02:10,100
Oh, there's all the items!

6248
04:02:10,300 --> 04:02:10,780
Bottles!

6249
04:02:10,880 --> 04:02:11,660
You can get that.

6250
04:02:11,720 --> 04:02:12,260
Yeah, yeah.

6251
04:02:12,380 --> 04:02:13,380
That's hair dryer?

6252
04:02:13,920 --> 04:02:14,740
That bottle?

6253
04:02:15,700 --> 04:02:17,280
Oh, that doesn't work!

6254
04:02:17,680 --> 04:02:18,480
It actually works.

6255
04:02:18,840 --> 04:02:19,100
Yeah.

6256
04:02:19,500 --> 04:02:20,920
I think I hear something, though.

6257
04:02:21,120 --> 04:02:21,340
That's so cool.

6258
04:02:22,060 --> 04:02:25,160
Yeah, we should probably Try to find a way out.

6259
04:02:25,160 --> 04:02:25,540
Yeah.

6260
04:02:25,880 --> 04:02:26,360
Wherever it is.

6261
04:02:26,460 --> 04:02:28,980
There's sometimes a fire escape over here.

6262
04:02:29,180 --> 04:02:29,800
Oh, there's a present!

6263
04:02:29,980 --> 04:02:30,480
There's a present!

6264
04:02:30,900 --> 04:02:31,880
Give bombs, though.

6265
04:02:32,380 --> 04:02:33,680
Gotcha, I can't hold it.

6266
04:02:34,540 --> 04:02:35,520
Yeah, I can't hold it.

6267
04:02:35,580 --> 04:02:37,220
Oh, I'm under hairbrush.

6268
04:02:38,220 --> 04:02:38,860
Under hairbrush?

6269
04:02:39,240 --> 04:02:39,880
What is that?

6270
04:02:40,360 --> 04:02:43,100
Um, um, um, um, um.

6271
04:02:43,540 --> 04:02:44,040
What's there?

6272
04:02:44,280 --> 04:02:44,320
Um.

6273
04:02:44,820 --> 04:02:45,280
What's there?

6274
04:02:45,400 --> 04:02:46,060
The brachan?

6275
04:02:46,820 --> 04:02:47,540
We riding it?

6276
04:02:47,920 --> 04:02:48,560
Is the brachan?

6277
04:02:50,200 --> 04:02:50,940
Go-go-go-go-go.

6278
04:02:51,420 --> 04:02:52,500
We have to go back.

6279
04:02:52,540 --> 04:02:52,760
We have to go back.

6280
04:02:52,760 --> 04:02:53,520
Oh, okay, okay.

6281
04:02:54,380 --> 04:02:54,740
Goku?

6282
04:02:55,740 --> 04:02:56,720
It's to our left.

6283
04:02:56,880 --> 04:02:57,500
It's to our left.

6284
04:02:58,400 --> 04:02:59,320
Should I open?

6285
04:02:59,480 --> 04:02:59,980
Should I open?

6286
04:03:00,120 --> 04:03:00,860
I have really...

6287
04:03:00,860 --> 04:03:02,000
Kind of like doing Quiddick's mode.

6288
04:03:02,080 --> 04:03:02,480
Open it!

6289
04:03:02,560 --> 04:03:03,120
Yeah, open it!

6290
04:03:03,220 --> 04:03:03,400
Alright.

6291
04:03:06,080 --> 04:03:06,520
Yeah!

6292
04:03:08,620 --> 04:03:09,880
Another hair dryer.

6293
04:03:11,060 --> 04:03:12,440
Another hair dryer.

6294
04:03:13,780 --> 04:03:14,620
Oh my gosh, wait.

6295
04:03:14,700 --> 04:03:15,360
How do we leave?

6296
04:03:16,240 --> 04:03:16,680
Um...

6297
04:03:16,680 --> 04:03:17,240
Oh my god.

6298
04:03:17,540 --> 04:03:17,960
There's a...

6299
04:03:17,960 --> 04:03:18,420
There's a...

6300
04:03:18,420 --> 04:03:19,420
There's a...

6301
04:03:19,420 --> 04:03:20,240
Oh.

6302
04:03:20,500 --> 04:03:21,400
He's opening the door.

6303
04:03:21,560 --> 04:03:21,820
What?

6304
04:03:22,000 --> 04:03:22,740
Who opened the door?

6305
04:03:22,760 --> 04:03:24,760
Why the was over there?

6306
04:03:26,740 --> 04:03:27,220
Um...

6307
04:03:27,700 --> 04:03:28,180
Um...

6308
04:03:28,180 --> 04:03:29,200
You guys see that?

6309
04:03:29,620 --> 04:03:30,340
See what?

6310
04:03:31,360 --> 04:03:31,680
Why?

6311
04:03:31,820 --> 04:03:33,180
It was a ghost girl!

6312
04:03:33,560 --> 04:03:34,680
You saw a ghost girl!

6313
04:03:34,880 --> 04:03:36,720
Oh, that's only you, I lost your life.

6314
04:03:36,720 --> 04:03:37,380
It's a ghost girl?

6315
04:03:39,240 --> 04:03:40,160
It's only for me?

6316
04:03:40,420 --> 04:03:40,760
Yeah.

6317
04:03:40,840 --> 04:03:41,880
No, that's only for you.

6318
04:03:42,180 --> 04:03:42,600
Oh!

6319
04:03:44,180 --> 04:03:45,400
I see you!

6320
04:03:49,620 --> 04:03:50,160
Uh-oh.

6321
04:03:50,240 --> 04:03:51,020
It's your egg!

6322
04:03:51,540 --> 04:03:52,460
Oh no, it's a-

6323
04:04:02,660 --> 04:04:03,920
I'm coming with you!

6324
04:04:04,880 --> 04:04:07,740
Go, go, go, go!

6325
04:04:07,740 --> 04:04:08,800
I

6326
04:04:13,720 --> 04:04:14,940
can't help you!

6327
04:04:14,940 --> 04:04:16,640
No, I'm gonna die to the trap!

6328
04:04:17,020 --> 04:04:17,300
No!

6329
04:04:20,750 --> 04:04:21,430
I'm ready!

6330
04:04:33,790 --> 04:04:34,470
I got it!

6331
04:04:34,470 --> 04:04:34,950
Kiki!

6332
04:04:38,350 --> 04:04:40,150
Yeah, that's crazy.

6333
04:04:41,370 --> 04:04:41,650
The

6334
04:04:48,300 --> 04:04:50,040
bugs came down from the ceiling.

6335
04:04:50,620 --> 04:04:51,880
It's stuck out there.

6336
04:04:52,280 --> 04:04:56,300
Oh my god.

6337
04:04:56,780 --> 04:04:57,940
We even made the jump!

6338
04:04:58,980 --> 04:05:00,160
Oh my gosh!

6339
04:05:00,660 --> 04:05:02,540
That was so crazy.

6340
04:05:03,560 --> 04:05:04,560
It was a lot.

6341
04:05:04,740 --> 04:05:06,620
Did the ghost girl killed you?

6342
04:05:06,820 --> 04:05:08,580
Yeah, it killed me, the ghost girl.

6343
04:05:08,980 --> 04:05:09,060
Yeah.

6344
04:05:09,320 --> 04:05:10,340
Three different things.

6345
04:05:10,480 --> 04:05:10,940
I know.

6346
04:05:11,560 --> 04:05:12,680
That's because you're paranoid.

6347
04:05:12,700 --> 04:05:13,680
Like, they're all hugging you.

6348
04:05:13,920 --> 04:05:20,500
I couldn't continue forward because the trap would have
crushed me and then the two mimics were blocking the other

6349
04:05:20,500 --> 04:05:20,980
way.

6350
04:05:22,800 --> 04:05:23,280
I saw.

6351
04:05:23,380 --> 04:05:23,540
I saw.

6352
04:05:23,540 --> 04:05:24,680
This is not just me and a mimic.

6353
04:05:25,240 --> 04:05:26,100
What the heck?

6354
04:05:26,760 --> 04:05:30,660
I hope Kiki gets lots of love wherever they go.

6355
04:05:31,200 --> 04:05:31,880
Oh, wait.

6356
04:05:32,120 --> 04:05:32,500
Yeah, Kiki.

6357
04:05:32,940 --> 04:05:33,300
Aw.

6358
04:05:33,560 --> 04:05:34,520
Oh no!

6359
04:05:35,520 --> 04:05:36,160
It's okay.

6360
04:05:36,520 --> 04:05:39,700
We were doing so well.

6361
04:05:40,760 --> 04:05:41,280
Yeah, we were.

6362
04:05:42,680 --> 04:05:43,220
Oh well.

6363
04:05:43,920 --> 04:05:46,120
Well, maybe you'll find another Kiki.

6364
04:05:46,680 --> 04:05:46,880
Yeah!

6365
04:05:47,180 --> 04:05:48,380
Find another Kiki.

6366
04:05:49,440 --> 04:05:50,700
Can I go the same place?

6367
04:05:51,300 --> 04:05:52,100
Oh yeah!

6368
04:05:53,500 --> 04:05:56,160
This is to you, Rend.

6369
04:05:56,720 --> 04:05:57,200
Sorry.

6370
04:05:57,700 --> 04:05:59,240
Oh wait, no, we have to go sell now.

6371
04:05:59,640 --> 04:06:00,060
Never mind.

6372
04:06:00,300 --> 04:06:02,260
No, it'll let us, right?

6373
04:06:02,380 --> 04:06:03,000
It'll let us.

6374
04:06:03,700 --> 04:06:04,760
Oh, it will let us.

6375
04:06:04,860 --> 04:06:06,300
Yeah, yeah, we just got to hold it down.

6376
04:06:07,920 --> 04:06:08,220
Yeah.

6377
04:06:10,020 --> 04:06:11,360
One more mention.

6378
04:06:11,700 --> 04:06:12,120
Outing.

6379
04:06:12,380 --> 04:06:14,020
Maybe we'll get the new monster.

6380
04:06:15,160 --> 04:06:16,480
I hope so.

6381
04:06:17,320 --> 04:06:19,160
No free run, no geeky.

6382
04:06:21,020 --> 04:06:22,420
We lost them all.

6383
04:06:23,060 --> 04:06:23,980
It's eclipsed?

6384
04:06:24,280 --> 04:06:25,800
Oh, we're so, we're so boned.

6385
04:06:26,180 --> 04:06:26,780
Oh, is it?

6386
04:06:26,980 --> 04:06:27,820
Oh, wow.

6387
04:06:28,100 --> 04:06:28,440
What?

6388
04:06:28,900 --> 04:06:29,780
Is it eclipsed?

6389
04:06:30,360 --> 04:06:31,140
Is it?

6390
04:06:31,140 --> 04:06:31,480
Yeah.

6391
04:06:32,560 --> 04:06:33,540
Wait, do you see the moon?

6392
04:06:33,560 --> 04:06:35,660
This might be the best run yet.

6393
04:06:37,100 --> 04:06:38,240
Yeah, it's an eclipse!

6394
04:06:39,900 --> 04:06:40,500
Last one, best run!

6395
04:06:40,500 --> 04:06:41,140
Last one, best run?

6396
04:06:41,820 --> 04:06:43,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6397
04:06:43,160 --> 04:06:44,240
Let's go!

6398
04:06:45,560 --> 04:06:46,360
Let's go!

6399
04:06:47,860 --> 04:06:48,900
Killed in!

6400
04:06:49,180 --> 04:06:50,520
No, he's not getting killed.

6401
04:07:36,660 --> 04:07:38,340
I don't trust Eclipse.

6402
04:07:38,880 --> 04:07:41,260
Whoa, it's so dark in here.

6403
04:07:41,280 --> 04:07:42,480
It's so dark in here.

6404
04:07:42,560 --> 04:07:42,960
Yeah, yeah.

6405
04:07:43,380 --> 04:07:44,680
I thought you died.

6406
04:07:44,980 --> 04:07:45,240
No.

6407
04:07:46,960 --> 04:07:51,300
Because it's Eclipse, I was like, I was trying to be sneaky.

6408
04:07:52,680 --> 04:07:53,080
Oh.

6409
04:07:55,640 --> 04:07:56,440
High voltage.

6410
04:07:57,080 --> 04:07:57,760
High voltage.

6411
04:07:58,560 --> 04:07:59,260
We can turn on it.

6412
04:07:59,280 --> 04:08:00,620
Wait, maybe we can turn the lights on.

6413
04:08:00,860 --> 04:08:01,040
Oh, yeah.

6414
04:08:01,180 --> 04:08:02,200
Maybe we can make a picture.

6415
04:08:02,640 --> 04:08:03,100
Yeah, yeah.

6416
04:08:03,760 --> 04:08:04,700
How do we do this?

6417
04:08:04,740 --> 04:08:05,540
Flip switch.

6418
04:08:06,120 --> 04:08:06,580
Switch, yeah.

6419
04:08:06,760 --> 04:08:06,920
E.

6420
04:08:08,800 --> 04:08:09,920
Oh, there we go.

6421
04:08:10,260 --> 04:08:10,760
Yeah, open the light.

6422
04:08:10,760 --> 04:08:12,060
Oh, yeah, we got some lights on.

6423
04:08:12,380 --> 04:08:12,780
Nice.

6424
04:08:13,140 --> 04:08:14,540
Okay, nice.

6425
04:08:15,440 --> 04:08:16,120
Nice, nice.

6426
04:08:16,380 --> 04:08:17,320
Kind of spooky, though.

6427
04:08:18,320 --> 04:08:19,540
Mamma Mia.

6428
04:08:20,820 --> 04:08:21,260
Oh man.

6429
04:08:22,440 --> 04:08:23,360
You're not my brother.

6430
04:08:24,740 --> 04:08:27,860
Oh, there's just a single key in the middle of the floor.

6431
04:08:28,180 --> 04:08:29,540
Oh, the heck, that's ominous.

6432
04:08:30,440 --> 04:08:30,720
Whoa.

6433
04:08:31,600 --> 04:08:33,120
Okay, I grabbed it.

6434
04:08:33,240 --> 04:08:33,600
Nice.

6435
04:08:34,640 --> 04:08:35,800
Mission accomplished.

6436
04:08:37,200 --> 04:08:37,440
Whoa.

6437
04:08:37,900 --> 04:08:39,320
It's a really big chair.

6438
04:08:41,700 --> 04:08:44,000
Scanning, scanning, where we had it.

6439
04:08:45,700 --> 04:08:47,760
Oh, it goes around, okay.

6440
04:08:48,320 --> 04:08:49,540
Oh, this is where we came from.

6441
04:08:49,920 --> 04:08:50,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6442
04:08:50,720 --> 04:08:51,160
Go down.

6443
04:08:51,560 --> 04:08:52,180
Yeah, go down.

6444
04:08:53,040 --> 04:08:53,360
Okay.

6445
04:08:53,680 --> 04:08:56,100
Maybe we'll have some lights on now and over here.

6446
04:08:56,500 --> 04:08:57,340
Oh, where am I?

6447
04:08:57,400 --> 04:08:58,000
Where am I?

6448
04:08:58,060 --> 04:08:58,680
The main room.

6449
04:08:59,120 --> 04:09:00,660
Oh, yeah.

6450
04:09:00,660 --> 04:09:01,440
Yeah, this looks right.

6451
04:09:01,800 --> 04:09:01,960
Right?

6452
04:09:02,180 --> 04:09:02,820
There's the main room.

6453
04:09:03,020 --> 04:09:03,640
Oh, yeah, yeah.

6454
04:09:03,720 --> 04:09:04,680
Yeah, we got the lights.

6455
04:09:06,960 --> 04:09:08,240
Oh, there's bottom lights.

6456
04:09:08,780 --> 04:09:10,880
Oh, didn't even notice it.

6457
04:09:14,200 --> 04:09:14,600
Okay.

6458
04:09:14,740 --> 04:09:15,600
We locked doors.

6459
04:09:15,760 --> 04:09:16,500
Oh, there's Freddy.

6460
04:09:17,000 --> 04:09:17,240
Oh, wait.

6461
04:09:17,300 --> 04:09:17,780
Oh, my God.

6462
04:09:17,920 --> 04:09:18,260
It's Freddy.

6463
04:09:18,320 --> 04:09:19,180
Hey boo!

6464
04:09:21,080 --> 04:09:24,000
Oh my god!

6465
04:09:49,700 --> 04:09:51,980
The precious thing!

6466
04:09:54,420 --> 04:09:56,430
Minto stole the precious thing!

6467
04:10:00,660 --> 04:10:21,160

Why don't you love me?

6469
04:10:26,700 --> 04:10:30,400
Here, someone else wants her.

6470
04:10:32,220 --> 04:10:33,200
Guys, Naki died.

6471
04:10:33,640 --> 04:10:34,400
Did Naki die?

6472
04:10:35,060 --> 04:10:35,460
Yeah.

6473
04:10:36,300 --> 04:10:36,960
Might have.

6474
04:10:40,340 --> 04:10:42,100
I hear him.

6475
04:10:48,130 --> 04:10:48,450
Oh.

6476
04:10:52,390 --> 04:10:54,850
Do I live with Raimu or...

6477
04:10:56,690 --> 04:10:58,020
Nah, we're gonna go back in.

6478
04:11:00,710 --> 04:11:01,850
If I die...

6479
04:11:05,300 --> 04:11:06,800
I don't think this area...

6480
04:11:06,800 --> 04:11:07,640
Yeah, this...

6481
04:11:07,640 --> 04:11:08,740
Oh no!

6482
04:11:09,200 --> 04:11:10,280
There's also the Yippies!

6483
04:11:10,720 --> 04:11:11,400
Wait, what's this?

6484
04:11:12,260 --> 04:11:13,540
Oh, there's just another vent.

6485
04:11:15,240 --> 04:11:16,840
The Yippies are also on the loose.

6486
04:11:19,660 --> 04:11:21,180
Maybe that's why there's no items.

6487
04:11:27,040 --> 04:11:28,120
Why is there music?

6488
04:11:30,620 --> 04:11:32,260
It's so scary for no reason.

6489
04:11:32,460 --> 04:11:32,880
Oh, it's a lot.

6490
04:11:33,180 --> 04:11:33,300
Wait.

6491
04:11:33,600 --> 04:11:34,420
Oh, I had a key.

6492
04:11:34,700 --> 04:11:36,120
I think in the last life.

6493
04:11:44,030 --> 04:11:45,770
You guys heard that music, right?

6494
04:11:59,010 --> 04:11:59,870
What the heck was that?

6495
04:12:01,790 --> 04:12:03,070
It was like a...

6496
04:12:06,640 --> 04:12:07,860
What was that sound?

6497
04:12:11,740 --> 04:12:12,900
Do you guys actually not hear that?

6498
04:12:12,920 --> 04:12:13,620
hear the ambience?

6499
04:12:13,920 --> 04:12:22,140
I mean, I think I do have the game kind of turned down
low-ish because the voices can get kind of loud, but maybe

6500
04:12:24,080 --> 04:12:25,580
I'm the only one hearing the ambience.

6501
04:12:31,000 --> 04:12:32,500
See, you can't hear that?

6502
04:12:44,260 --> 04:12:45,520
What is that sound?

6503
04:12:46,820 --> 04:12:48,140
That is cheap.

6504
04:12:49,300 --> 04:12:51,220
Are those teeth in the middle of a trap?

6505
04:13:00,090 --> 04:13:01,850
I got my choppers.

6506
04:13:02,730 --> 04:13:03,910
You can't scare me.

6507
04:13:04,610 --> 04:13:04,890
Oh.

6508
04:13:10,660 --> 04:13:11,840
My choppers!

6509
04:13:12,900 --> 04:13:14,320
You can't scare me.

6510
04:13:14,940 --> 04:13:15,760
What am I hearing?

6511
04:13:21,310 --> 04:13:23,790
Actually, I have no idea what I'm hearing.

6512
04:13:25,570 --> 04:13:27,410
You guys heard the slimy thing too, right?

6513
04:13:28,030 --> 04:13:28,910
Am I going crazy?

6514
04:13:30,390 --> 04:13:31,530
There's actually nothing here.

6515
04:13:40,760 --> 04:13:41,900
He's a janitor!

6516
04:13:42,780 --> 04:13:43,080
Wait!

6517
04:13:43,320 --> 04:13:43,980
I'm a maid!

6518
04:13:46,160 --> 04:13:47,320
Wait, what is he?

6519
04:13:47,640 --> 04:13:48,780
He's a butler.

6520
04:13:49,500 --> 04:13:49,760
Ah!

6521
04:13:55,740 --> 04:13:57,660
He will kill if you are alone.

6522
04:13:58,620 --> 04:13:59,920
That's so evil.

6523
04:14:00,540 --> 04:14:02,760
Oh my gosh, I've never seen him before.

6524
04:14:05,500 --> 04:14:05,840
Oh my god.

6525
04:14:36,990 --> 04:14:39,230
I'm actually not sure if he's a new guy or not.

6526
04:14:41,270 --> 04:14:42,190
But he seems new.

6527
04:14:43,750 --> 04:14:44,990
Doesn't seem like a mod.

6528
04:14:47,330 --> 04:14:48,770
He's not following me right here.

6529
04:15:29,040 --> 04:15:33,280
out kind of sounds like bug screw like scrittling around

6530
04:15:37,660 --> 04:15:50,620
i don't know why they're dead i have no idea it's okay don't
it doesn't matter if we grab anything it was the last day it

6531
04:15:50,620 --> 04:16:01,100
doesn't matter but that's true let's go yay i got to the dog
yeah Yeah, we got Raimu though.

6532
04:16:01,100 --> 04:16:02,380
I'm glad you saved her.

6533
04:16:03,120 --> 04:16:04,280
Can I die with Raimu?

6534
04:16:05,160 --> 04:16:06,400
You did what you do.

6535
04:16:07,340 --> 04:16:07,680
Sister.

6536
04:16:08,420 --> 04:16:09,220

Raimu!

6542
04:16:21,950 --> 04:16:24,110
She left me.

6543
04:16:30,120 --> 04:16:30,720
No!

6544
04:16:31,160 --> 04:16:32,020
Raimu.

6545
04:16:32,460 --> 04:16:32,880
Goodbye.

04:16:37,500 --> 04:16:38,780
15 deaths.

04:22:25,480 --> 04:22:26,120
Mesh!

6651
04:22:30,280 --> 04:22:31,380
Bye-bye!

6652
04:22:33,080 --> 04:22:34,980
oh, oh, oh!

6653
04:22:35,180 --> 04:22:35,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

6654
04:22:35,860 --> 04:22:37,100
Where's your sweet spoon?

6655
04:22:38,020 --> 04:22:39,180
Touch-butt, I guess.

6656
04:22:39,460 --> 04:22:40,020
Oh, yeah, yeah!

6657
04:22:40,360 --> 04:22:40,680
Touch-butt.

6658
04:22:41,260 --> 04:22:41,900
Vo を!

6659
04:22:42,740 --> 04:22:45,780
I cannot even see him!

6660
04:22:47,580 --> 04:22:49,680
Yeah, I can just imagine it.

6661
04:22:49,680 --> 04:22:50,700
It's okay, it's not the exact sign.

6662
04:22:52,000 --> 04:22:55,880
Oh my god, you guys are really, you were really on top of
each other.

6663
04:22:56,040 --> 04:22:56,640
Oh, oh.

6664
04:22:57,220 --> 04:22:58,420
Oh, oh, oh.

6665
04:22:58,560 --> 04:22:58,580
Yeah.

6666
04:23:00,220 --> 04:23:02,820
I'm gonna go talk to my chat a little bit now.

6667
04:23:03,160 --> 04:23:03,800
Same here.

6668
04:23:03,820 --> 04:23:04,120
Okay.

6669
04:23:05,660 --> 04:23:06,680
Bye bye everyone!

6670
04:23:06,960 --> 04:23:07,560
Bye bye!

6671
04:23:08,080 --> 04:23:08,380
Bye bye!

6672
04:23:17,940 --> 04:23:18,420
Yay!

6673
04:23:19,100 --> 04:23:20,520
Let me...

6674
04:23:21,420 --> 04:23:21,900
Maybe...

6675
04:23:21,900 --> 04:23:23,480

6678
04:23:52,280 --> 04:23:55,900
of us Well, the three, the four of us, I'm not in the
picture though.

6679
04:23:58,380 --> 04:24:00,460
Oh, there we go.

6680
04:24:02,540 --> 04:24:03,440
That was so fun.

6681
04:24:03,600 --> 04:24:04,200
Oh my gosh.

6682
04:24:04,740 --> 04:24:06,260
I've never played with the mods before.

6683
04:24:06,380 --> 04:24:08,040
I don't know what mods we had.

6684
04:24:09,140 --> 04:24:10,300
Hold on, I think I can check.

6685
04:24:12,300 --> 04:24:15,860
There's so many that it's like, let's see.

6686
04:24:17,020 --> 04:24:20,000
We have more suits, more emotes, yippee.

6687
04:24:20,880 --> 04:24:21,760
Flashlight toggle.

6688
04:24:22,260 --> 04:24:23,060
I don't know what's on that.

6689
04:24:23,500 --> 04:24:34,720
Better item scan, better stamina, skin walkers, push to
mute, um, a couple patch things, helmet cameras, walkie use,

6690
04:24:34,880 --> 04:24:43,540
I don't, we never use a walkie, so, needy cats, it's, hey,
it's me, Goku, it doesn't work, so sad, Metal Gear sneaking

6691
04:24:43,540 --> 04:24:52,360
theme, lethal clunk, which was the, my, the pipes, um,
lethal presence, which was the present, what's more screams?

6692
04:24:54,100 --> 04:24:58,320
Modification allows you to hear players' voice for two
seconds after they die.

6693
04:24:58,800 --> 04:25:01,480
Oh, cool.

6694
04:25:03,140 --> 04:25:08,380
Yeah, it says adds the hey it's me Goku audio to the bracken
whenever it hunts you.

6695
04:25:12,140 --> 04:25:13,200
And he was hunting me.

6696
04:25:13,320 --> 04:25:13,980
He was.

6697
04:25:14,660 --> 04:25:19,460
Lethal plushies is the one that adds the free-rin plush and
stuff.

6698
04:25:20,560 --> 04:25:21,520
And big boss suit.

6699
04:25:24,620 --> 04:25:27,320
A lot of this was Emuri, too.

6700
04:25:27,500 --> 04:25:30,280
She, like, found all the mods, basically.

6701
04:25:30,800 --> 04:25:36,900
Well, my friend gave me some mods, and then we kind of added
more to it.

6702
04:25:37,620 --> 04:25:41,940
But Emuri, like, tested everything and made sure it was,
like, not going to crash.

6703
04:25:42,320 --> 04:25:45,120
Like, unfortunately the Minecraft one didn't work.

6704
04:25:45,220 --> 04:25:47,480
It was going to add, like, a Minecraft map.

6705
04:25:47,840 --> 04:25:49,980
But if only we had played right before...

6706
04:25:49,980 --> 04:25:51,640
If only we had played before the update.

6707
04:25:52,060 --> 04:25:52,640
But that's okay.

6708
04:25:53,960 --> 04:25:55,240
The big boss suit?

6709
04:25:55,340 --> 04:25:57,820
Yeah, that's what I was wearing the whole time, but you
couldn't see.

6710
04:25:58,260 --> 04:26:01,800
I should have asked someone to put it on so I could see what
it looked like.

6711
04:26:02,000 --> 04:26:06,060
Okay, I'm going to have to go see their VOD so I can see
what it looked like.

6712
04:26:07,780 --> 04:26:08,940
That was so much fun.

6713
04:26:10,100 --> 04:26:10,500
Man.

6714
04:26:12,160 --> 04:26:14,840
Glad that I could play with everyone.

6715
04:26:17,560 --> 04:26:20,500
So, yeah, thank you again, MOD, for setting this up.

6716
04:26:20,600 --> 04:26:22,880
And I'm glad that I could play with Naki before her hiatus.

6717
04:26:23,500 --> 04:26:25,280
Um, play with Ayla Saman.

6718
04:26:25,700 --> 04:26:26,260
Yeah.

6719
04:26:27,700 --> 04:26:29,260
I'll catch the bots too.

6720
04:26:29,420 --> 04:26:31,540
Yeah, everybody's super duper awesome.

6721
04:26:32,140 --> 04:26:33,260
They're all my friends.

6722
04:26:35,000 --> 04:26:36,740
So, really happy.

6723
04:26:37,880 --> 04:26:40,840
I got to hang out with Emory a couple times in Japan.

6724
04:26:41,440 --> 04:26:49,900
So, um, yeah, I'm glad that even after all this time we've
been able to, you know, hang out and be friends and do

6725
04:26:49,900 --> 04:26:50,800
everything.

6726
04:26:53,760 --> 04:26:55,060
Yeah, we're friends.

6727
04:26:55,400 --> 04:26:55,960
We're friends.

6728
04:26:57,840 --> 04:26:58,700
It was a lot of fun.

6729
04:26:58,820 --> 04:26:59,680
Yeah, I hope you guys had fun.

6730
04:26:59,740 --> 04:27:01,000
There was some really funny moments.

6731
04:27:01,120 --> 04:27:02,780
I cannot believe that.

6732
04:27:03,280 --> 04:27:04,520
That mimic round.

6733
04:27:05,160 --> 04:27:06,660
Where I thought it was one of that.

6734
04:27:06,940 --> 04:27:09,320
You know why I thought it was one of them following too?

6735
04:27:11,040 --> 04:27:12,600
Because none of them crouch.

6736
04:27:14,760 --> 04:27:18,320
None of them crouch when they're walking outside sometimes.

6737
04:27:18,620 --> 04:27:19,440
So it's just like.

6738
04:27:20,020 --> 04:27:20,700
So I was just like.

6739
04:27:21,040 --> 04:27:22,680
Oh, and then it also had Emudy's voice.

6740
04:27:22,840 --> 04:27:23,220
So I was just like.

6741
04:27:23,500 --> 04:27:28,440
She's just being quiet because she's trying to, you know,
avoid the dogs, but she said like, hey, like, you know, she

6742
04:27:28,440 --> 04:27:28,960
said something.

6743
04:27:29,100 --> 04:27:30,080
So I was like, oh, it's just Emedy.

6744
04:27:30,640 --> 04:27:31,860
That was so crazy.

6745
04:27:33,340 --> 04:27:40,100
And the shadow was cast on her, so I would have never seen
the, the, the face.

6746
04:27:40,240 --> 04:27:41,260
I never saw the face.

6747
04:27:41,860 --> 04:27:43,700
That was so, it was creepy.

6748
04:27:44,320 --> 04:27:47,100
I think that was the creepiest moment I've ever had with the
Mimic.

6749
04:27:48,600 --> 04:27:50,480
Skinwalker mod really pulled through in that moment.

6750
04:27:50,620 --> 04:27:51,500
I know.

6751
04:27:54,440 --> 04:28:06,100

04:29:43,360 --> 04:29:44,160
Don't worry, oh, sorry.

6765
04:29:44,660 --> 04:29:45,300
I won't read this.

6766
04:29:45,600 --> 04:29:46,620
I was really from watching you guys.

6767
04:29:46,680 --> 04:29:49,140
I put you on the background while I was making pickled eggs.

6768
04:29:49,480 --> 04:29:50,420
It was hard not laughing.

6769
04:29:50,720 --> 04:29:51,760
Good night, thanks for the stream.

6770
04:29:52,040 --> 04:29:53,360
Aw, thank you.

6771
04:29:54,200 --> 04:29:56,380
Are you going to finish Twin Snakes next stream?

6772
04:29:56,980 --> 04:29:58,060
I don't know.

6773
04:29:59,680 --> 04:30:00,180
We'll see.

6774
04:30:00,640 --> 04:30:03,460
I might go crazy and try and finish it.

6775
04:30:04,680 --> 04:30:06,400
I might go crazy and try and finish it.

6776
04:30:06,820 --> 04:30:07,140
We'll see.

6777
04:30:08,280 --> 04:30:08,720
I still...

6778
04:30:08,720 --> 04:30:09,120
I'm what?

6779
04:30:10,540 --> 04:30:11,100
Like...

6780
04:30:12,580 --> 04:30:13,820
I'm not halfway.

6781
04:30:16,220 --> 04:30:17,240
Am I halfway?

6782
04:30:20,840 --> 04:30:23,100
The briefings did take a good chunk of time.

6783
04:30:23,320 --> 04:30:25,000
It always takes 40 minutes.

6784
04:30:25,780 --> 04:30:27,180
I'm past half, for real?

6785
04:30:28,000 --> 04:30:28,140
Oh.

6786
04:30:32,580 --> 04:30:33,800
I always think of...

6787
04:30:33,800 --> 04:30:37,240
It's funny, because I always think of, like, the switching
of the CDs as halfway.

6788
04:30:38,260 --> 04:30:41,440
Yeah, Disc 2 has halfway, but it's actually not really.

6789
04:30:42,400 --> 04:30:45,420
I almost always miss my chance to catch these live, but
today was the day!

6790
04:30:45,540 --> 04:30:46,480
JL, thank you!

6791
04:30:46,700 --> 04:30:47,760
Congrats for your awesome game.

6792
04:30:47,860 --> 04:30:49,200
Wow, thank you so much.

6793
04:30:50,060 --> 04:30:50,860
Meryl Silverberg.

6794
04:30:51,400 --> 04:30:53,020
Thank you for the fun Lethal Company collab.

6795
04:30:53,200 --> 04:30:54,000
A lot of funny moments.

6796
04:30:54,100 --> 04:30:55,560
Looking forward to your next Metal Gear Solid stream.

6797
04:30:55,840 --> 04:30:56,400
Can I hardly wait?

6798
04:30:56,560 --> 04:30:57,620
I've been thinking about...

6799
04:30:57,680 --> 04:31:06,920
Oh my gosh, I've been thinking about, um, about, uh, about
Twin Snakes, like, all week.

6800
04:31:07,000 --> 04:31:08,420
I was just like, maybe I should move it sooner.

6801
04:31:08,640 --> 04:31:09,540
Maybe I should move it sooner.

6802
04:31:09,740 --> 04:31:15,340
Every time I play Metal Gear, I just want to play, I just
want to, I just always can't wait for the next time I play

6803
04:31:15,340 --> 04:31:15,940
it again.

6804
04:31:17,760 --> 04:31:19,680
Does Twin Snakes also have the disc switch?

6805
04:31:19,780 --> 04:31:21,360
It does, yeah, it does.

6806
04:31:23,220 --> 04:31:25,640
Um, I have, uh-oh.

6807
04:31:27,680 --> 04:31:28,240
You can hear it.

6808
04:31:28,340 --> 04:31:31,440
I have disc two right here.

6809
04:31:33,420 --> 04:31:38,860
So disc one is obviously in my GameCube at the moment.

6810
04:31:41,480 --> 04:31:46,260
But I was thinking about April 30th.

6811
04:31:47,260 --> 04:31:49,340
I think I have another plan for April 30th.

6812
04:31:49,380 --> 04:31:53,020
What I kind of want to do instead of just play.

6813
04:31:53,080 --> 04:31:57,460
Because I was thinking of like starting or like doing kind
of marathoning.

6814
04:31:57,680 --> 04:32:06,100
Metal Gear Solid 2 and finishing on April 30th, but I do
have another plan of something I kind of want to do

6815
04:32:06,100 --> 04:32:10,520
involving April 30th Metal Gear related.

6816
04:32:11,720 --> 04:32:22,140
And once I do plan on replaying all most, if not all, the
games.

6817
04:32:23,100 --> 04:32:40,660
So at least like, you can definitely expect me to play MGS1
through Peace Walker at least because I have some plans so

6818
04:32:43,360 --> 04:32:55,680
but I do plan on playing them on streaming them so yes 5 is
a long one to replay that's the only one I'm debating but at

6819
04:32:55,680 --> 04:33:01,160
the same time I might get to the end and I might be like,
man, I gotta play it.

6820
04:33:03,120 --> 04:33:07,260
So, usually miss your streams, but your current schedule
actually got me finally catching your streams.

6821
04:33:07,380 --> 04:33:08,380
Oh my gosh, Strike Warlock!

6822
04:33:08,540 --> 04:33:09,140
Thank you!

6823
04:33:09,620 --> 04:33:10,340
Thank you so much.

6824
04:33:10,460 --> 04:33:10,940
Thank you, thank you.

6825
04:33:11,480 --> 04:33:17,800
Will you be playing all of the Metal Gear games so we can
experience the Brain Rot a second cough, cough, burst time?

6826
04:33:18,640 --> 04:33:19,460
Of course.

6827
04:33:21,720 --> 04:33:22,820
So, Revengeance again?

6828
04:33:23,120 --> 04:33:26,320
Revengeance will be at the end.

6829
04:33:27,340 --> 04:33:29,360
I'll actually play it in order.

6830
04:33:29,820 --> 04:33:30,200
Not that I...

6831
04:33:30,200 --> 04:33:30,780
Well, I mean...

6832
04:33:30,780 --> 04:33:31,280
I...

6833
04:33:34,060 --> 04:33:37,660
I mean, when I first played them, I kind of played, you
know...

6834
04:33:37,660 --> 04:33:39,320
I played it, you know.

6835
04:33:40,620 --> 04:33:41,430
Well, you know...

6836
04:33:43,300 --> 04:33:43,720
Stop!

6837
04:33:44,360 --> 04:33:45,100
You guys stop!

6838
04:33:47,020 --> 04:33:48,060
You guys suck.

6839
04:33:50,940 --> 04:33:51,800
Oh, great stream.

6840
04:33:51,940 --> 04:33:54,080
Trying to catch more live, but the mods help me get through
work.

6841
04:33:54,180 --> 04:33:56,020
No, I appreciate you watching the mods.

6842
04:33:57,340 --> 04:33:57,820
so much.

6843
04:33:57,900 --> 04:33:59,620
Thank you so much, Kangaroo wife.

6844
04:34:00,620 --> 04:34:02,280
Especially looking forward to the MGS stream.

6845
04:34:02,460 --> 04:34:03,000
Thank you!

6846
04:34:03,900 --> 04:34:05,080
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6847
04:34:05,200 --> 04:34:06,420
You made us like this?

6848
04:34:06,640 --> 04:34:07,740
I didn't do anything.

6849
04:34:09,000 --> 04:34:10,160
Played it in heaven, right?

6850
04:34:10,580 --> 04:34:10,980
Yeah.

6851
04:34:12,880 --> 04:34:15,180
Yeah, in heaven.

6852
04:34:15,320 --> 04:34:16,720
Release order or chronologically?

6853
04:34:17,180 --> 04:34:21,480
I did think about playing it chronologically, but I don't
think I...

6854
04:34:21,480 --> 04:34:22,140
I don't know.

6855
04:34:22,280 --> 04:34:27,320
I really feel like playing it in release order.

6856
04:34:27,340 --> 04:34:35,540
order just feels you know the bestest even though i've
already played it in release order and everything phd

6857
04:34:35,540 --> 04:34:44,740
killers welcome back oh my gosh five months wait it kept up
it kept the initial stuff too thanks for the chaotic collab

6858
04:34:44,740 --> 04:34:54,540
boss thank you that's so awesome this is such a fun stream
to watch thanks to you and the others so happy you're here

6859
04:34:54,540 --> 04:34:58,300
thank you shy thank you Yeah.

6860
04:34:59,260 --> 04:35:01,280
MGS3 hits harder if you played in release order.

6861
04:35:01,920 --> 04:35:02,280
Agreed.

6862
04:35:02,600 --> 04:35:04,580
You know guys, I've been thinking a lot about it.

6863
04:35:05,340 --> 04:35:06,340
Avoid MGS5.

6864
04:35:06,520 --> 04:35:07,180
I have issues.

6865
04:35:10,400 --> 04:35:11,520
Really Huey.

6866
04:35:11,660 --> 04:35:12,960
You have issues?

6867
04:35:13,860 --> 04:35:14,380
Really.

6868
04:35:14,780 --> 04:35:16,220
Oh my gosh, we die!

6869
04:35:16,520 --> 04:35:17,640
Thanks for the hot dog.

6870
04:35:20,100 --> 04:35:21,560
What was I gonna say?

6871
04:35:21,660 --> 04:35:30,520
Oh, I've been thinking so much about, I don't know,
Recently, I think it's because I was like April 30th is

6872
04:35:30,520 --> 04:35:31,160
coming up.

6873
04:35:31,880 --> 04:35:35,700
For a long time, I was like, MGS3 is my favorite Metal Gear.

6874
04:35:35,940 --> 04:35:37,940
MGS3 is my favorite one.

6875
04:35:38,300 --> 04:35:41,880
MGS3 is like, I just love everything about MGS3.

6876
04:35:42,620 --> 04:35:47,640
But now, I think I've changed my mind.

6877
04:35:47,940 --> 04:35:52,100
And I think I've changed my mind for like, for good.

6878
04:35:52,540 --> 04:35:55,280
Because I always would kind of be like, 3 is so awesome.

6879
04:35:55,440 --> 04:35:56,120
3 is my favorite.

6880
04:35:57,340 --> 04:35:59,040
It's like neck and neck, you know?

6881
04:36:00,200 --> 04:36:03,800
But now I think, honestly, 2 is my favorite.

6882
04:36:05,740 --> 04:36:07,060
I think 2 is my favorite.

6883
04:36:08,020 --> 04:36:09,500
And then 2 is Peace Walker.

6884
04:36:10,880 --> 04:36:12,120
And then 3.

6885
04:36:12,620 --> 04:36:13,680
Isn't that so crazy?

6886
04:36:14,340 --> 04:36:15,540
2 is just special.

6887
04:36:16,040 --> 04:36:22,420
I think there's like a weird sense of nostalgia that I feel
with 2, even though I never played it as a kid.

6888
04:36:24,220 --> 04:36:26,740
Like, the ending of...

6889
04:36:26,740 --> 04:36:33,060
of MGS3 obviously hits, but like there's something about the
ending of MGS2 that hits even harder.

6890
04:36:33,620 --> 04:36:34,280
I don't know.

6891
04:36:35,200 --> 04:36:36,580
Okay, so Pliskin on side B.

6892
04:36:36,800 --> 04:36:37,060
Lulu!

6893
04:36:38,300 --> 04:36:38,780
You're...

6894
04:36:38,780 --> 04:36:39,280
Oh my gosh.

6895
04:36:39,440 --> 04:36:40,680
First of all, you are so fast.

6896
04:36:40,800 --> 04:36:43,340
Second of all, I didn't think you were... Like, I was not
serious.

6897
04:36:43,660 --> 04:36:46,700
I didn't think this would actually happen if it's actually
happening.

6898
04:36:46,960 --> 04:36:47,460
And three!

6899
04:36:47,800 --> 04:36:48,580
Oh my gosh!

6900
04:36:48,820 --> 04:36:49,960
He looks so good!

6901
04:36:50,200 --> 04:36:51,460
He looks so good.

6902
04:36:51,780 --> 04:36:52,680
You're incredible.

6903
04:36:52,900 --> 04:36:53,480
You're amazing.

6904
04:36:55,560 --> 04:37:07,120
The handshake and the moment that hits me the hardest in
this series ever no man i love mgs i just mgs too i love it

6905
04:37:07,120 --> 04:37:13,960
love metal gear solid i love metal gear solid too ending is
so insane that it's more memorable i think so i think also

6906
04:37:13,960 --> 04:37:23,480
because like obviously i was like oh my gosh kind of
brainwraited from from metal gear solid but like metal gear

6907
04:37:23,480 --> 04:37:31,340

6911
04:38:03,420 --> 04:38:08,580
my brain rot is never going away i got some more metal gear
goods in today

6912
04:38:12,020 --> 04:38:21,960
uh which one of them was um you know i never actually had
the soundtrack for for metal gear solid 2 like i have i have

6913
04:38:21,960 --> 04:38:28,960
like a bunch of cds and some of them contain like music from
the games but um I don't have like dedicated CDs for each

6914
04:38:28,960 --> 04:38:38,000
game except two I finally could find that one but I need to
find like a CD like the ones I have of three are like oh

6915
04:38:38,000 --> 04:38:51,980
this is different variations of Snake Eater um but um I want
like the actual game music soundtrack you know in terms of

6916
04:38:51,980 --> 04:38:58,640
gameplay I think 5 is my favorite or my favorite is five but
i love them all oh yeah the gameplay in five is phenomenal

6917
04:38:58,640 --> 04:39:07,440
phenomenal it's so fun it's so awesome mgs2 is more locked
to my brain than any other game in the series i think so for

6918
04:39:07,440 --> 04:39:16,940
me too i think mgs2 has the most memorable memes for me but
mgs3 is my favorite story i can i can get with that but even

6919
04:39:16,940 --> 04:39:25,460
for two like three i love quoting so much i'm always like i
want some more I don't know.

6920
04:39:26,220 --> 04:39:27,520
The two is just...

6921
04:39:28,080 --> 04:39:29,600
It's just something about it.

6922
04:39:29,900 --> 04:39:32,320
Like I said, it makes me feel nostalgic in a way that...

6923
04:39:32,960 --> 04:39:35,420
I shouldn't feel nostalgic for, but...

6924
04:39:35,420 --> 04:39:35,740
I do.

6925
04:39:37,360 --> 04:39:38,040
I don't know.

6926
04:39:39,180 --> 04:39:42,200
I also really like stories that take place...

6927
04:39:42,780 --> 04:39:43,520
at the ocean.

6928
04:39:44,960 --> 04:39:45,900
Like, uh...

6929
04:39:45,900 --> 04:39:46,860
Like, I'm...

6930
04:39:46,860 --> 04:39:49,960
I love the beach so much.

6931
04:39:50,360 --> 04:39:51,280
I love the ocean.

6932
04:39:51,440 --> 04:39:54,300
And so, like, one scene that, like, really sticks out to
me...

6933
04:39:55,120 --> 04:40:05,240
is um is when emma and ridden are when she's about to like
when when she's about to you know get attacked by vamp but

6934
04:40:05,240 --> 04:40:13,020
like when they're climbing down the the ladder and like then
they walk outside and like it's just the sunset and they're

6935
04:40:13,020 --> 04:40:21,220
just looking over the water and i'm like it's so beautiful
so so visually beautiful and orange

6936
04:40:26,640 --> 04:40:28,160
Manage to avoid drowning.

6937
04:40:28,600 --> 04:40:29,680
The ocean is so comfy.

6938
04:40:30,200 --> 04:40:30,760
It is.

6939
04:40:31,080 --> 04:40:36,640
I don't have like, I know some people have like that fear of
the ocean, the deep ocean, but...

6940
04:40:37,740 --> 04:40:38,300
Who is vamp?

6941
04:40:38,540 --> 04:40:39,900
This is vamp because he's a vampire?

6942
04:40:40,720 --> 04:40:43,280
Oh my gosh, next time I play, I have to get that codec.

6943
04:40:46,620 --> 04:40:48,520
It's so fun using the mic on E.E.

6944
04:40:48,520 --> 04:40:49,560
and hearing her complain.

6945
04:40:50,260 --> 04:40:51,980
There's just so much in this area.

6946
04:40:52,160 --> 04:40:54,120
Sorry, I know I'm always talking about Metal Gear.

6947
04:40:55,200 --> 04:40:56,060
Can't help it.

6948
04:40:56,900 --> 04:40:58,060
I can't help it.

6949
04:40:58,160 --> 04:41:00,540
It's because I have no one else to talk to about it.

6950
04:41:01,600 --> 04:41:02,600
So I'm like overflowing.

6951
04:41:02,980 --> 04:41:05,780
Whenever I meet with my friend Maddie.

6952
04:41:05,980 --> 04:41:06,780
Oh, that's Raspberry.

6953
04:41:08,300 --> 04:41:10,040
I'm just like...

6954
04:41:10,040 --> 04:41:12,120
We are just like non-stop.

6955
04:41:12,880 --> 04:41:13,400
Like...

6956
04:41:15,660 --> 04:41:18,680
Because she and I share this same brain ride.

6957
04:41:19,000 --> 04:41:19,440
It's so...

6958
04:41:19,440 --> 04:41:20,480
And it's so nice.

6959
04:41:20,700 --> 04:41:21,360
It's so awesome.

6960
04:41:21,640 --> 04:41:26,200
I really want to play Resident Evil next so that I can
also...

6961
04:41:28,300 --> 04:41:30,420
So I can also talk to her about it.

6962
04:41:30,740 --> 04:41:35,180
So I don't plan on playing through the series again.

6963
04:41:35,460 --> 04:41:36,780
Like, not super soon.

6964
04:41:37,400 --> 04:41:38,020
Soon-ish.

6965
04:41:38,440 --> 04:41:39,880
Maybe I'll probably start it this year.

6966
04:41:40,620 --> 04:41:41,600
I mean, it's only April.

6967
04:41:44,900 --> 04:41:45,860
But, yeah.

6968
04:41:49,400 --> 04:41:51,420
You have to get into No More Heroes.

6969
04:41:51,740 --> 04:41:52,220
Yeah!

6970
04:41:53,060 --> 04:41:53,860
I do.

6971
04:41:53,980 --> 04:41:55,440
So I can talk to her about that, too.

6972
04:41:57,280 --> 04:42:00,020
Yeah, I think you'll have a lot of fun playing Resident
Evil.

6973
04:42:00,400 --> 04:42:01,250
Yeah, I hope so.

6974
04:42:08,930 --> 04:42:14,490
I have no clue about MGS, but I'm happy to have the chance
to know about it with your second playthrough.

6975
04:42:14,970 --> 04:42:17,050
Oh, Raisin!

6976
04:42:17,430 --> 04:42:17,970
Yes!

6977
04:42:19,470 --> 04:42:22,950
I hope you like it as much as I do.

6978
04:42:26,430 --> 04:42:28,270
So, oh boy.

6979
04:42:28,490 --> 04:42:30,050
This is gonna be good.

6980
04:42:32,610 --> 04:42:40,230
Resident Evil also has some great deep lore to uncover, but
not as much as the Fungi Game Meta Universe Mono.

6981
04:42:40,450 --> 04:42:43,530
What the... Those were words that you strung together?

6982
04:42:46,350 --> 04:42:46,970
Yes.

6983
04:42:49,750 --> 04:42:52,790
Original or remakes for the first four REs?

6984
04:42:54,850 --> 04:43:00,870
I don't really want to play the first Resident Evil
original.

6985
04:43:02,010 --> 04:43:02,830
I don't know.

6986
04:43:03,070 --> 04:43:03,690
I don't know.

6987
04:43:05,090 --> 04:43:06,930
Have you played any Resident Evil game before?

6988
04:43:07,090 --> 04:43:09,950
I've only played a little bit of Resident Evil 1 the
original.

6989
04:43:13,830 --> 04:43:14,730
The game company.

6990
04:43:14,870 --> 04:43:15,810
All their games are connected.

6991
04:43:17,750 --> 04:43:18,470
Got it.

6992
04:43:18,670 --> 04:43:18,830
Got it.

6993
04:43:19,050 --> 04:43:19,350
Got it.

6994
04:43:21,330 --> 04:43:27,450
From what I understand is the remakes for Resident Evil are
all pretty good.

6995
04:43:27,450 --> 04:43:29,710
From what I understand.

6996
04:43:30,770 --> 04:43:31,630
I think.

6997
04:43:32,130 --> 04:43:32,930
Hey, Bubba Girl.

6998
04:43:33,550 --> 04:43:35,450
Hey, Kami's Prize, Mint's...

6999
04:43:36,390 --> 04:43:36,790
Thieve.

7000
04:43:37,470 --> 04:43:38,410
It cuts off.

7001
04:43:41,010 --> 04:43:42,570
Liam, thank you.

7002
04:43:44,050 --> 04:43:45,890
I enjoy hearing you talk about MGS.

7003
04:43:46,070 --> 04:43:49,350
It's how I am about Dragon Age and Mass Effect and Ace
Combat to a lesser degree.

7004
04:43:50,470 --> 04:43:53,490
It's fun to be super into something, right?

7005
04:43:54,770 --> 04:43:56,750
All the remakes except three are good.

7006
04:43:57,450 --> 04:43:57,770
Okay.

7007
04:43:58,890 --> 04:44:00,810
RE3 and 4 are downgrades for me.

7008
04:44:01,070 --> 04:44:03,910
See I heard a lot of people say RE4 remake is pretty good.

7009
04:44:05,230 --> 04:44:07,210
But I had not heard about 3.

7010
04:44:07,850 --> 04:44:08,890
3 is a bit bare bones.

7011
04:44:11,270 --> 04:44:12,770
3 is just short.

7012
04:44:15,310 --> 04:44:15,810
I don't know.

7013
04:44:17,090 --> 04:44:19,050
I played any Castlevania before?

7014
04:44:19,270 --> 04:44:20,910
I have played Symphony of the Night.

7015
04:44:21,990 --> 04:44:22,350
Yes.

7016
04:44:23,950 --> 04:44:24,390
Okay.

7017
04:44:24,590 --> 04:44:26,770
I should really go to bed since it's almost 3 a.m.

7018
04:44:27,450 --> 04:44:28,230
really go to bed.

7019
04:44:28,870 --> 04:44:30,270
Thank you guys for sticking around.

7020
04:44:31,150 --> 04:44:35,470
I really want to talk more because we haven't been able to
talk the whole time, but I should really go to bed.

7021
04:44:35,810 --> 04:44:39,370
We'll talk a lot more tomorrow when I play stuff.

7022
04:44:40,090 --> 04:44:41,510
Yeah, I'm planning to buy Metal Gear Series.

7023
04:44:41,610 --> 04:44:43,370
Any suggestions which one I should start with?

7024
04:44:43,730 --> 04:44:44,830

better for some people.
