1
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,420
Do you guys want to know how many worlds that is?

2
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,540
That's like 10.

3
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,940
I think that's more than 10 actually.

4
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,540
Can I capture the game now?

5
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,800
I can capture the game now, right?

6
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,320
Wait, so I gotta stop streaming, right?

7
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,200
Oh, I'm streaming.

8
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,720
I got a little bit lost.

9
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,500
So, hello everybody.

10
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,160
Welcome to Pico Park 2.

11
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,880
We all have foogies that tell us what color we are.

12
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,560
I'm yellow.

13
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,940
Guys, please, I can't move.

14
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,680
Yeah, you were on my head the entire time.

15
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,520
Yeah, how's it feel?

16
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,280
How's it feel?

17
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,480
How's it feel?

18
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,600
Oh my gosh!

19
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,340
Is something happening?

20
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,200
Who screwed something up?

21
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,720
His butt is on me.

22
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,280
Oh, now I actually can't move.

23
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,080
Actually, what if I switch between you guys?

24
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,560
That's good.

25
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,620
Here we go.

26
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,220
How does this work?

27
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,420
I think we have to do it at the same time.

28
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,140
Oh wait, no we don't.

29
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,600
Okay, I don't know.

30
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,140
Wait, why doesn't the health spring jump?

31
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,180
Yeah, why doesn't it work?

32
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,820
Maybe we each...

33
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,700
Maybe we have to do it at the same time.

34
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,840
There's like one for each of us, so I feel like that has to be a mechanic.

35
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,660
Okay.

36
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,460
Surely.

37
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,380
Okay, why don't we all get off the spring, guys?

38
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,680
Why don't we all...

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,020
Guys, the spring's not working.

40
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,560
They can't be doing this in level one.

41
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,500
That's how much...

42
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,560
Okay.

43
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,760
We have a method to our minds.

44
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,400
Okay, wait.

45
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,940
Wait, I think I know.

46
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,420
I think I know.

47
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,460
What if, like, I fall from here and then...

48
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,580
Okay, no, that doesn't work.

49
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,400
Okay, so if I die, right?

50
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,120
Hit me out.

51
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,780
Stop!

52
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,220
Guys, I don't...

53
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,900
There's no way.

54
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,560
There's no way we're tall enough.

55
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,840
There's like eight of us.

56
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,920
What if someone jumps from the top person?

57
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,540
Oh, that's true.

58
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,020
You make a tower.

59
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,980
You make a tower.

60
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,420
Oh.

61
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,720
Nice.

62
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,620
Okay.

63
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,220
You're like a little diving board.

64
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,120
All right, do we have a diving board?

65
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,260
Guys.

66
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,400
Guys, this is level one, guys.

67
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,720
I think we've got a little...

68
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,260
Oh, we're cooked.

69
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,900
It's left.

70
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,100
It's left.

71
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,280
Come on.

72
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:47,860
Come on.

73
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,860
Come on.

74
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,640
I'm stacked up.

75
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:52,940
Okay.

76
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,720
I'm stacked up.

77
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,560
You're stacked up.

78
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,300
What are we...

79
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,640
Okay.

80
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,720
Keep going up, guys.

81
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,420
Keep going up.

82
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,460
Is it enough to get to the top?

83
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,280
Yes.

84
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,840
I feel like we're off by like one.

85
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,500
We got this.

86
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,140
We got this.

87
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,640
We can make it!

88
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,100
We can make it if we try!

89
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,580
Oh my god!

90
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,000
No way!

91
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,460
Press the button!

92
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,240
I didn't be here the whole...

93
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,500
Oh!

94
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,660
Now they're usable!

95
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,040
We did have to start.

96
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,720
I can't believe it was that easy.

97
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,380
You have to jump on the button every time.

98
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,020
Well someone's tongue gets bumped!

99
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,020
Go!

100
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,340
Go!

101
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,840
We bumped!

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,520
Yippee!

103
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,480
That was so smart!

104
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,460
That only took us way too long.

105
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,840
We have to stack up.

106
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,260
Yeah guys.

107
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,240
Make an elevator.

108
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,600
I think it only does the other one, right?

109
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:45,700
Yeah.

110
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,640
Again?

111
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,580
Why is it counting down?

112
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,640
Is that a bad thing?

113
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,820
Oh it's time.

114
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,540
Oh no!

115
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,940
Into space!

116
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,660
We have to each...

117
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,140
You see the vision!

118
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:02,640
Go!

119
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,020
Go!

120
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,440
Go!

121
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,160
Oh my god.

122
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,900
No I jumped!

123
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,380
I'm an idiot!

124
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,960
I don't think it works if there's people on the heads.

125
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,660
Yeah if there's people on top it doesn't work.

126
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,500
So we gotta...

127
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,900
I like my role of watching like a god.

128
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,180
Here we go!

129
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:17,780
What?

130
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,760
What?

131
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,600
I'm dying for red!

132
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,900
We have to wait for life to get to the other side!

133
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,000
Any day now.

134
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,480
Today's the day?

135
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,060
Okay.

136
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,240
Some people made it.

137
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,620
I'll be Bud Impressor.

138
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,600
Good!

139
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,020
My favorite bit of PicoPoc.

140
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,640
I'll be the last one.

141
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,980
I can make it.

142
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,360
Don't worry.

143
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,260
Yay!

144
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,660
Okay.

145
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,340
Where's the key now?

146
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,880
I got the key.

147
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,540
I don't think so.

148
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,600
Let us in!

149
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,920
Let us in!

150
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,200
We did it!

151
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,640
Can you imagine if someone fell right now?

152
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,400
Yeah like...

153
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,780
We fell like number one off the bat.

154
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,400
So we're gonna skip world seven, right?

155
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,260
Or world seven?

156
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:15,760
Yeah, seven three.

157
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,240
Okay we're on one, two.

158
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,320
Alright, good.

159
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,000
Seven of us.

160
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,260
Okay.

161
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,180
Dream walk makes the dream walk, baby.

162
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,140
Who's not doing their part?

163
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,120
Who's not doing their part?

164
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,340
Go, guys!

165
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,600
What the heck?

166
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,720
Wait, what just happened?

167
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,020
Somebody just died.

168
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,700
Okay, so can we like bait that?

169
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,460
I was impaled!

170
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,020
Did you blame this on me?

171
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,400
Okay, you can't bait it.

172
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,540
The box hit it.

173
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,880
So the box has to hit it first.

174
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,440
All we have to do is not walk to the left.

175
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,600
You mean the right?

176
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,680
I mean the right.

177
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,900
We'll see about that.

178
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,200
Left, the other left.

179
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,220
Let's go.

180
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:02,980
Push!

181
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:02,980
Push!

182
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,760
We need everybody to do their part.

183
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,600
Okay, now go left.

184
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,640
Push!

185
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,260
Push!

186
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,500
Okay.

187
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,220
Push!

188
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,740
Push!

189
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,240
Push!

190
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,320
Get off the box!

191
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,660
Get off the box!

192
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,080
I want to see uncharted territory.

193
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,520
I'll go for it.

194
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,920
I will go for it if you do this.

195
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,880
I will go for it.

196
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,380
Are you for serious?

197
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,780
It's level 2!

198
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,840
It's level 1.

199
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,500
It's not even level 1.

200
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,660
It's level 1.

201
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,540
It's level 1.

202
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,360
Stop fighting!

203
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,840
I'm trying to push.

204
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,280
I'm not the one who died.

205
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,140
It was Doki.

206
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,520
Doki, come on.

207
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,420
Okay, let's go.

208
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,300
Push!

209
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,680
It's going to hit that, right?

210
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,820
It's not.

211
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,700
No!

212
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,060
What?

213
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,680
Somebody was underneath the box.

214
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,460
What if somebody was underneath the box?

215
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,400
I had the right idea.

216
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,200
Take one for the team, buddy.

217
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,740
Take one for the team, buddy.

218
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,740
They wear the box.

219
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,200
How do you wear it and people still push it?

220
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,500
Oh, you drop it on your head.

221
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,560
Drop it on your head.

222
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,580
I've got a little surprise for you.

223
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,940
Yeah, yeah, you beat me!

224
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,440
Go, Snuffy, go!

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,940
Oh, it works!

226
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,340
Yeah, yeah, she's so genius!

227
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,200
We are shockingly intelligent!

228
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,620
She's invincible!

229
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,060
She's wearing a bicycle helmet.

230
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,140
Follow me.

231
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,740
Nice.

232
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,380
Stop, stop, stop!

233
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,960
We need karma!

234
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,800
Oh, we gotta jump on the box.

235
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,920
Stack, guys!

236
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,740
Stack, stack!

237
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,380
We're stacking?

238
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,040
We're stacking?

239
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,160
I'm pushing, I'm pushing.

240
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,440
Now you just put it in the door.

241
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,420
The key?

242
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,480
The door.

243
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,560
You just have to put the key in the door.

244
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,320
Guys...

245
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,000
Can you leave out?

246
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,840
We're doing great.

247
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,520
Yeah, we got this.

248
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,960
We're so good, maybe.

249
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,720
We might be gamers.

250
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,220
We're a bunch of Teletubbies.

251
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,260
We might be gamers, guys.

252
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,800
Look at that.

253
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,020
This is how we build friendship, everybody.

254
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,340
Oh!

255
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,580
What's this?

256
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,560
Oh my goodness gracious.

257
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,460
Hit it again, again, again!

258
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,720
Keep going, keep going!

259
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,400
Fix the problem!

260
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Go, go, go!

261
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,620
Go!

262
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,180
Go!

263
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,900
Oh!

264
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,680
Ahhh!

265
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,440
What the heck?

266
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,820
We don't have to do it anymore.

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,500
Yeah, we're good.

268
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,660
I just wanted to...

269
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,280
That was too easy.

270
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,280
Let's do it again.

271
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,500
Screw the door.

272
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,520
We definitely messed up somehow.

273
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,840
You say that, we'll find a way.

274
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,180
What if it, like, collapses on top of us?

275
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,860
Alright.

276
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,560
We all got blood force trauma.

277
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,580
I feel like the skill jump is gonna hit us hard in level 2.

278
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,340
I feel like the skill jump is gonna hit us hard in level 2.

279
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:20,640
No, no, no.

280
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,440
Woah, woah, woah.

281
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,940
What's going on?

282
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,380
The platforms are moving!

283
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,500
Don't hit the jumpy jumps.

284
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,360
Don't go jump.

285
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,160
Jumpy jumps.

286
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,360
Don't go over there.

287
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,160
What if I go really fast?

288
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,640
There we go.

289
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,340
Oh, okay.

290
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,740
Use me as a stepping stool.

291
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,120
That is incredibly confusing.

292
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,100
I don't like the screen zooming out like that.

293
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,560
Oh, we each have to have a button.

294
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,580
We each have to have a button.

295
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,100
Jump on.

296
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,060
I got the left side.

297
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,100
Okay, I got this button.

298
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,340
Ow.

299
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,200
And then we have three more, three more.

300
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,220
That little hole, you see that little hole?

301
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,680
Just gotta climb it.

302
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:10,980
Yes!

303
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,120
Yay!

304
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,300
Where's the last one?

305
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,360
Oh, the last one's over there.

306
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,100
Not cracked.

307
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,720
I'm pushing the button.

308
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,420
And then...

309
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,920
Mint, this is your job to...

310
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,580
Okay.

311
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,760
To not die?

312
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,800
I mean...

313
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,100
I can always go back.

314
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:32,700
Ooh.

315
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,000
Go back on the button.

316
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,260
Oh, thank god.

317
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,460
Okay.

318
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
Oh, that one.

319
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,140
I just went through.

320
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,880
Wait, was that me?

321
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,920
Did you just abandon us?

322
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,660
No, it's okay, guys.

323
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,600
Wait, which button is that?

324
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,800
You just come back when you remember about me, okay?

325
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,560
Is it this one?

326
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,860
I'll find you!

327
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,240
I'll find you!

328
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,800
I got you.

329
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,620
Who would have...

330
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,160
Who could have done such a thing?

331
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,680
Wow.

332
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,660
You trapped me in the green world.

333
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,500
Okay.

334
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,740
Wait, anything but that.

335
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,980
I'm gross.

336
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,940
What do we do about live?

337
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,980
No, I'm over here.

338
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,760
Who's that that's lost and stuck?

339
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,140
Just, okay, here.

340
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,660
Just jump like this.

341
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,880
Just jump.

342
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,400
I'm scared.

343
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,940
I'm scared.

344
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,140
I'm sorry.

345
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,400
Do you like the little projectile I made for you?

346
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,240
The analysis on how to jump?

347
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,540
Sorry.

348
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,680
You should be sorry.

349
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,020
We have like a laser pointer for our cat.

350
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,380
A laser pointer to guide her.

351
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,260
Yay!

352
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,680
Wow!

353
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,320
What the heck?

354
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,420
I'm gonna be so proud of all of you guys.

355
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,500
Alright, let's show you guys how much we have.

356
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,700
This is so easy.

357
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,340
Oh, never mind.

358
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,280
What the heck is this?

359
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,180
That's just what is right at the end.

360
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,920
We should just do the last level.

361
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,100
Guys, okay, let's see what it's like.

362
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,940
Yeah, let's just see what it's like.

363
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,480
Yeah.

364
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,430
That's not good, is it?

365
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,910
Yes, it is!

366
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,290
Just go right!

367
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,190
Just go right!

368
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,690
No!

369
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,270
Have a great life, everyone.

370
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,210
Well, maybe not everyone.

371
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,510
It's always yellow.

372
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,490
Yeah, it's always yellow.

373
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,090
Who is yellow?

374
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,870
Who is yellow?

375
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,830
Oh, my God!

376
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,050
You need to lock in by pressing D.

377
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,650
Hold down the right key one time.

378
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,030
Ah!

379
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,650
Wow, man!

380
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,450
What did I tell you?

381
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,910
How do we actually, like, ignore that?

382
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,570
I'm gonna get out.

383
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,190
Stop jumping over.

384
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,590
This is a pig issue.

385
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,970
We actually would have made that if it hadn't been for you, Donkey.

386
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,230
You were so close that time.

387
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,930
Did you just run over everybody?

388
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,230
No!

389
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,550
Ah!

390
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,670
Everyone just grabbed a wall.

391
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,270
Oh, my bad.

392
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,430
I went backwards.

393
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,370
Guys, if we can be level one...

394
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,170
Guys, if we can be level one...

395
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,310
Guys, if we can be level one...

396
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,070
If we can be this level, we can be all the other levels, guys.

397
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,630
That's so true!

398
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,270
I feel like the other level is the baddest for this.

399
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:51,630
Okay.

400
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,430
We have to stack to the side, guys.

401
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,690
We have to play the game.

402
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,830
We have to play the game.

403
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,510
Why aren't you moving?

404
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,290
I'm trying to.

405
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,330
I'm trying to.

406
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,890
I'm trying to.

407
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,570
Run!

408
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,190
Run!

409
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,530
We played farther than we ever have.

410
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,390
That was really far.

411
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,490
Five in a row, huh?

412
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,770
World record!

413
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:21,510
Oh, my God.

414
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,610
We're back, we're back, we're back!

415
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,570
Okay, go, go, go, go!

416
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,670
Dang it.

417
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,070
We're so close.

418
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,850
We figured it out, though.

419
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,390
Oh, oh, oh, my God.

420
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,470
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

421
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,510
We'll get overfilled.

422
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,570
There can't be any delay, guys.

423
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,210
There can't be any delay.

424
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,550
Three, two, one!

425
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,110
We have to get away!

426
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,650
We can't stop!

427
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:49,850
Yikes!

428
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,550
Literally, it can't stop!

429
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,530
Hey, what are you doing?

430
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,010
What are you doing?

431
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,890
What are you doing?

432
00:16:59,130 --> 00:16:59,710
What are you doing?

433
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,390
Oh, my God.

434
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,130
I'm the end!

435
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,230
I'm the end!

436
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,910
I'm pretty sure this kind of torture was depicted in the Bible.

437
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,570
Just hold it down!

438
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,290
Just hold it down!

439
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,650
Dante's Inferno would be like...

440
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,790
Which circle of hell is this?

441
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:22,370
One must imagine Sisyphus on the other side.

442
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,790
One must imagine Sisyphus at Pico Park.

443
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,890
Okay, well, we can do this, I believe.

444
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,270
Why is it always both of us?

445
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,430
It's because some of you guys have to go to the right side.

446
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,150
So we need, like, four people on the far right.

447
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,270
And then the rest of us have to bridge the thing.

448
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,510
Okay, there we go.

449
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,490
Okay, okay, okay.

450
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,610
Go, go, go, go!

451
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,150
Okay, nice, nice.

452
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,790
Is the gear come back?

453
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,350
Is the gear come back?

454
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,590
Yeah, we're going.

455
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,570
We're gonna go.

456
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,010
Oh, it does, it does.

457
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,150
I got you, little guy.

458
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,110
Okay, my life is in your hands.

459
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,210
Cradle.

460
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,170
Guys, we made it.

461
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,170
Oh, my God, we did it!

462
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,730
Oh, wait.

463
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,290
Oh, that's two saws.

464
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,570
What are you doing, you fool?

465
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,550
We'll see what happens to her.

466
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,730
Okay, keep going forward.

467
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,070
Okay.

468
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,170
Okay, everything seems okay.

469
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,750
I don't see a saw.

470
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,470
I think we're good.

471
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,450
He said that.

472
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,950
Wait, what do you mean by that?

473
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:30,990
Hey, hey, wait a second.

474
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,710
What Kentucky hat?

475
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,990
I can't...

476
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,870
No, I don't deal with that.

477
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:39,710
I'm not...

478
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,770
Come on, come on, come on.

479
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,610
We're playing as a team.

480
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,790
Come on, come on.

481
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,710
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

482
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,470
Hold your hand.

483
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,130
We have a buddy system.

484
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,970
We should get a buddy system right now.

485
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,670
Just in case.

486
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,550
What have I just stood here?

487
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,370
We need to know what's up ahead.

488
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,810
What lies ahead of us.

489
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,030
Oh, no!

490
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,710
Get ready to go!

491
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,470
No!

492
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,510
Okay, what I have to do is...

493
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,810
I think we have to stack up to somewhere.

494
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,550
Okay, so let me just get over here.

495
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,110
Yeah, let's just get ready.

496
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,270
Wait, how does it go back down?

497
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,830
Yeah, we can't go back down.

498
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,390
I think we have to stack here.

499
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,170
No, but...

500
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,870
Let's see if there's anything up there.

501
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,110
We have to run and get to the safe point.

502
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:30,910
No, wait.

503
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,210
It's not going to go down once we have the...

504
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,450
How do we get back down?

505
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,890
I don't think there's anything up there.

506
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,790
Okay, so there's nothing up there.

507
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,790
Let the elevator go down and then maybe...

508
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,350
What if that was something up there?

509
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,390
Okay, I'm sensing...

510
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,530
Can you jump into the elevator?

511
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,850
Maybe the stars will go at a different time or something.

512
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:49,790
Where's the door?

513
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:50,550
Is it back there?

514
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,350
Are we sure nothing's up there?

515
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,330
Where was the door?

516
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,770
Yeah, the door is at the very beginning.

517
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,190
Oh, it is?

518
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,270
Oh, it was!

519
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,850
Okay, we send one lone soldier.

520
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,350
One brave soul.

521
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,370
Alright, Green, you're closest.

522
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,610
You got this, bro guy.

523
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:09,070
Green is closest.

524
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,130
Alright, Green, you're closest.

525
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,770
And we'll inch across to see how much space we can get.

526
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,110
And we'll inch across to see how much space we can get.

527
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,150
One brave soul.

528
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,430
One brave son.

529
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:25,750
You have to get over so we can see the key.

530
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:25,870
You have to get over so we can see the key.

531
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,750
Oh, oh.

532
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,510
Oh, gosh.

533
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,990
We can't even seize it if we want to.

534
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,310
Okay, get ready to go down.

535
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:33,770
Oh, god!

536
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,650
Okay.

537
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,130
Ready?

538
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,950
Guys, guys, guys, guys!

539
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,590
Get out of the way!

540
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:45,950
Get out of the way!

541
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,690
Get out of the way!

542
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,310
Don't let them massacre us!

543
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:52,850
Don't

544
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:03,190
let them massacre us!

545
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,870
Did you see the door?

546
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,210
We found it!

547
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,730
I still don't really know how to do a thing.

548
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,350
I still don't really know how to do a thing.

549
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,370
You have to do it one at a time.

550
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,490
I need to go single file.

551
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:13,850
Single file, yeah.

552
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,530
It's literally single file, which is what I was trying to say.

553
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,350
You need to jump single file.

554
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,230
Oh, come on, Toki!

555
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,370
Into the grave.

556
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,610
Feels like we're in kindergarten and Lime's the teacher.

557
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:25,630
Nah.

558
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,750
Mama!

559
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,230
Mama!

560
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,030
Oh, my god!

561
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,110
Please!

562
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,830
Oh, my god!

563
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,230
I don't piss myself.

564
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,430
That was almost impressive.

565
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,730
Alright, let's go.

566
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,350
Any day now!

567
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,450
Jump over you if you're too strong!

568
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,470
Jump over you if you're too strong!

569
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,470
Alright, we got this.

570
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,210
Okay!

571
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,110
Alright, Toki, I'll take you.

572
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,610
Toki, your big head is in the way.

573
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,250
Okay, there we go.

574
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,650
Watch out, Toki!

575
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,970
I'm okay, I'm okay!

576
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,270
Everything is fine!

577
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,010
See?

578
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,610
Everything is fine!

579
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,170
All good, everyone.

580
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,690
Bye!

581
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,790
A single soldier.

582
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,350
Just me.

583
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,330
From this world.

584
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,170
Okay.

585
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,570
We should all make, like, a single line.

586
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,950
No one on top of each other's head.

587
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,070
Let's do a test run.

588
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,930
Like, imagine we have the key.

589
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,450
Oh, yeah.

590
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,330
Oh, yeah, yeah!

591
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,310
Ready, set, go!

592
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,270
Okay.

593
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:31,730
You gotta jump.

594
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,430
You gotta do this.

595
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,650
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

596
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,070
At the very bottom, too.

597
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,990
Wait, can you jump and then it goes down a little bit?

598
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,650
Is that?

599
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,070
Yeah!

600
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,470
Oh, if you keep jumping!

601
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,430
Okay.

602
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,350
Okay, okay, okay.

603
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,510
Okay.

604
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,170
Good system!

605
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,050
Good system!

606
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,350
Okay, we have the mechanics now.

607
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,750
Don't forget the other one also needs the first one for victory.

608
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,170
Can this squish someone?

609
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,690
Oh.

610
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,490
Why would you immediately sacrifice yourself to find out?

611
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,330
For science!

612
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,110
For science!

613
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,230
She just loves playing this game, guys.

614
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:09,890
Are you ready?

615
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,810
You ready?

616
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,010
Go, go, go, go, go!

617
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:15,370
Here we go!

618
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:16,750
Alright.

619
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,630
Oh, I can't.

620
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,070
Oh!

621
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,170
Keep going!

622
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:33,680
Bring the key higher up or we'll be fucked over by the uh, the thing.

623
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,460
Yep, still there.

624
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,880
Oh, god.

625
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,720
The key won't move.

626
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,420
Oh, there you go.

627
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,360
Oh, you can pass it!

628
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,840
Yeah, you can pass it.

629
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,160
Okay, you're passing it to you.

630
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,260
Okay, I'll pass it to you.

631
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,540
How do you give it to somebody?

632
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,380
Okay, I guess not.

633
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,360
Okay, we'll go.

634
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,660
We gotta be patient.

635
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,460
We gotta be patient.

636
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,940
Yeah, be patient.

637
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
The person ahead has to have the key!

638
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,860
Who has the key?

639
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,620
I've got the key!

640
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,740
Alright, go.

641
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,260
No, you go.

642
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,060
You have the key.

643
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,960
And we decide now.

644
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,360
You have the key and I'm the key.

645
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,000
And who's home?

646
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,040
Okay.

647
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,560
I'm gonna wait for the thing.

648
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,280
I'm scared.

649
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,100
Go!

650
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,180
Go!

651
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,440
I'll get out of the way.

652
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:18,900
I'll get out of the way.

653
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,180
Alright.

654
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,900
Three, two, one, go!

655
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,140
Woohoo!

656
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,460
Yay!

657
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,840
Okay.

658
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,440
I'm too scared.

659
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,240
Careful.

660
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,280
Don't panic.

661
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,320
Careful.

662
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,360
Just gotta be patient.

663
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,460
Careful Spongebob.

664
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,340
Careful Spongebob.

665
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,460
Careful Squidward!

666
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,520
Careful Spongebob!

667
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,240
I'm scared.

668
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,520
I don't wanna go.

669
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,480
I'm scared.

670
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:42,480
I don't wanna go.

671
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,620
Please, we don't wanna do this again.

672
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,100
Please, we don't wanna do this again.

673
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,180
I wanna master this level.

674
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,680
Let's do it one more time.

675
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:49,980
I wanna master this level.

676
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:49,980
Let's do it one more time.

677
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,980
Let's get a speedrun, guys.

678
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,340
Yeah, we could be faster for sure.

679
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,120
Yeah, we could really honestly be faster.

680
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,720
We could actually be on speedrun.com, guys.

681
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,920
Oh no!

682
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,120
Oh my god.

683
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,630
Well, your wish came true, it seems.

684
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,210
I'll do it.

685
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:09,930
I'll do it.

686
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,830
I'll do it.

687
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,590
I'll do it.

688
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,790
There's actually no way.

689
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,010
We were basically done.

690
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,350
I want to run back.

691
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,630
I want to run back.

692
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:31,570
I will jump over your head.

693
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,150
One more time, she says.

694
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,590
I will jump over your head.

695
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,350
Just one more time.

696
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:36,810
Just one more time.

697
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,070
I can't get over there.

698
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:41,950
Oh my god.

699
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,170
Come on, just go, please.

700
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,590
Oh my god.

701
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:49,410
Oh my god.

702
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:52,150
I think we've learned from this that we would all be the first to die.

703
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:52,590
Hey, hey, hey.

704
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,830
What are you doing?

705
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,830
What are you doing?

706
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,210
What are you doing?

707
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,670
Oh man.

708
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,230
What are we talking about?

709
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:01,930
Oh man.

710
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,610
Okay, everything is fine.

711
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,730
We'll just leave room down there.

712
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

713
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,310
Try again.

714
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,630
Try again.

715
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,710
I don't want to try again.

716
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,390
Wait, so who's white?

717
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,510
Oh my god, it was Amelie.

718
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,090
Alright.

719
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,810
We got this.

720
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,430
It's okay.

721
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,650
We'll get the world record now.

722
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,490
We'll get the world record.

723
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,210
That's a funny one.

724
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,050
You guys can actually go up more than one by one.

725
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:36,550
Yeah.

726
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,930
This is kind of fast.

727
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:40,710
I'm locked in, guys.

728
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,350
Alright.

729
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,050
Okay, there we go.

730
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:46,910
Let's go.

731
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,390
Single file line, remember guys.

732
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

733
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:51,610
I'm sorry.

734
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,210
I'm sorry.

735
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,430
Go, go, go.

736
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,270
I had to wait.

737
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,770
I had to wait to see it.

738
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,830
Oh my god.

739
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,630
Okay, okay.

740
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,830
Go, go, go.

741
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,770
I didn't have to wait.

742
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,750
I forgot I could just move.

743
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,830
You have to jump up and down to make it go down fast.

744
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,290
Alright.

745
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,710
Nice, I'm ahead.

746
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,890
It's a miracle we got all the people just like massacred immediately there.

747
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,050
It's a miracle we got all the people just like massacred immediately there.

748
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,670
We only got massacred about two seconds later.

749
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,350
How does she do that?

750
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,140
It's like wall hacking.

751
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,080
What is this?

752
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,720
How do you do it so fast?

753
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,700
It's the only way we can get this.

754
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,120
It doesn't matter.

755
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,120
It ain't done already.

756
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,540
I'm stuck.

757
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,440
I'm stuck.

758
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,020
I'm not letting you jump past me.

759
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,320
We're so back.

760
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,180
That was good.

761
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,060
It was good.

762
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,420
It was good.

763
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,980
This is the run, guys.

764
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,540
Okay, I'll walk over so you guys can go down.

765
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,620
Oh, never mind.

766
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,080
Sorry.

767
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,980
That's a good plan.

768
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,000
Okay, sorry.

769
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,300
Just, uh, you know.

770
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,200
You'll make it.

771
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,580
You just gotta get there.

772
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,320
You just gotta get there.

773
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,280
Just get up here, guys.

774
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,900
Can't be that bad.

775
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,260
You know what you're saying, right?

776
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:26,700
Nightmare, nightmare.

777
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,900
We can do this.

778
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,340
It's always you and me, Ren.

779
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:31,820
Stop pushing me.

780
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,280
I'm not pushing you.

781
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,740
I'm not touching you.

782
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,320
You're touching my aura.

783
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,000
Here we go.

784
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,620
Be ready.

785
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,060
Okay, go, go.

786
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,740
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

787
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,900
Okay, okay.

788
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,880
Two can be at the same time.

789
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,580
You have to jump.

790
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,100
And when you get, if it starts moving up, you jump.

791
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,700
And then it'll go back down even faster.

792
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,760
Guys, can you try not dying?

793
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,400
I know, but there are people all the way with me.

794
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,380
How do you do that?

795
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,820
Every time you do that, we die.

796
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,580
No, it's not true.

797
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,600
It's true.

798
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,660
Oh, Jesus.

799
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,140
What?

800
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,180
How?

801
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,800
What happened?

802
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,560
Stop.

803
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:40,780
Sorry.

804
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,140
It starts so fast.

805
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,020
Ever since the gray incident, it's never been the same.

806
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,520
Ever since the gray incident, it's never been the same.

807
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,660
Our motivation is gone.

808
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:53,780
Salvation.

809
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,560
I'm gray, like my will to live.

810
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,700
I'm gray, like my will to live.

811
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,160
Okay, here we go.

812
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,100
The jumping will not work if there's tons of you on the platform, because you would all have to jump at exactly the same place.

813
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

814
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,140
Yeah, we got it right the first time.

815
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,160
What happened to us?

816
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,220
I happened.

817
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,200
Which last time?

818
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,960
And a greed happened.

819
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,760
We're becoming masters of this level.

820
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,660
It's fine.

821
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,860
That's not something to be proud of.

822
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,420
We're going to be so good for the next one, though.

823
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,440
We're going to be so good at Chapter 2.

824
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,000
If we beat Chapter 15 with like zero knowledge, we got this.

825
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,140
Okay.

826
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,120
Someone do an example just to make sure we know what to do at this point.

827
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,600
Alright, guys.

828
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,960
Okay, let's practice, guys.

829
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,780
Okay, let's practice.

830
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,100
Here we go.

831
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,420
Your turn.

832
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,220
One at a time.

833
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,720
Okay.

834
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,520
You just do that.

835
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,740
Lime would have been dead.

836
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,220
I feel like we have to have a drill sergeant in Peacock Park.

837
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,020
Go, go, go, go.

838
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,980
Children, this is a fire drill.

839
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:06,480
Okay?

840
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,620
Imagine if there's a fire.

841
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,240
Alright.

842
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,080
Okay.

843
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,780
This is the run.

844
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,500
This is the run.

845
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,320
Yeah, yeah.

846
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,180
Go, go, go.

847
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,700
Guys, guys.

848
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,800
One at a time.

849
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,220
One at a time.

850
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,560
Okay.

851
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,060
Get the key close.

852
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,200
The first person has to unlock the door.

853
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,080
Guys, guys, guys, please.

854
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,340
There's a green goblin on my head.

855
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,580
Okay.

856
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,260
Alright, Bao.

857
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,020
It's all up to you.

858
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,580
You're unlocking.

859
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:45,920
Alright.

860
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,100
Go, go, go, go.

861
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:49,800
Okay.

862
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,260
Alright, Min.

863
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,900
It's up to you.

864
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,660
I'm waiting for it.

865
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,540
I'm waiting for it.

866
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,780
Okay.

867
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,400
Don't answer the call of the void.

868
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,000
Alright.

869
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,380
Nice.

870
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,640
Okay, we can do it.

871
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,160
We're back.

872
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,420
I'm scared.

873
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,400
I'm scared.

874
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,740
I don't think we should risk death.

875
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,300
Wait, wait, wait.

876
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,840
Wait till it goes back.

877
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,620
Nice, nice, nice.

878
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,340
Okay, I'll go first.

879
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,040
Okay.

880
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,320
Slow and steady.

881
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,680
Slow and steady.

882
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,800
Amelie, you go next.

883
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,120
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

884
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,340
Okay.

885
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,560
Okay, now we should be good.

886
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,640
Now we should be good.

887
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,380
Okay, let's have that thing go back up and down.

888
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:33,920
Please.

889
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,660
No.

890
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,960
Oh my god.

891
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,040
Nice, okay.

892
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:40,900
Nice.

893
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,220
No way you lose these.

894
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:42,900
Let's go.

895
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,520
We are finally on the scoreboard.

896
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,200
This is so good.

897
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,620
I held my breath and I feel lightheaded.

898
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,960
How do we already pull it from the way through?

899
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,440
How do I get up?

900
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,540
Don't you go back there.

901
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,520
Oh, come on.

902
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,020
Let's learn the game.

903
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,780
Let's learn the game, guys.

904
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,400
Now?

905
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,520
Now, why were we on level 15?

906
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,240
Oh no, what is this?

907
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,980
The worm!

908
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:18,420
Just don't die.

909
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,440
Okay, you guys.

910
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,640
Jump over it.

911
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,860
We can jump over it.

912
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,140
Oh, you can stand on it, I think.

913
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,440
You can stand on it.

914
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,420
You can stand on it.

915
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,340
I say it's the velocity that gets you.

916
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,420
Oh, who died?

917
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,120
My bad.

918
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,720
Apologies.

919
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,360
Okay, the order changes every time.

920
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,180
Who was pushing me?

921
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,740
I wasn't even pressing my keys.

922
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:49,820
What?

923
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,120
The order changes every time, guys.

924
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:52,840
Okay.

925
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,060
I can't jump if you're on my head.

926
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,680
Stop it.

927
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,540
Stop it.

928
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,800
Something about a chungus butt.

929
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,400
Okay, that is all right.

930
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,180
No, it's not good.

931
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,020
I'm coming back.

932
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,080
Let's try not to get tangled.

933
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:15,720
Okay.

934
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,140
We have to stack.

935
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,300
Doki, swap with me.

936
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,520
I see.

937
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,980
What if you fall?

938
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,560
Will you drag us all with us?

939
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,400
Yes.

940
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,840
I think so.

941
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,680
We need you to get out.

942
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,300
I can't move.

943
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,200
I can't move.

944
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,580
Actually, it's not letting me.

945
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,360
There we go.

946
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,080
Don't push me off the edge.

947
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,420
Mr. Purple, can you...

948
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,320
I'm moonwalking.

949
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,860
I'm moonwalking.

950
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,540
Okay.

951
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,340
And then...

952
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,380
Oh, sorry.

953
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,760
Okay.

954
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,520
And then...

955
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,260
And then...

956
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,120
Jump over and then...

957
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,660
Wait.

958
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,040
Drag and drag and drag.

959
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,660
Hey.

960
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,220
Hey.

961
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,740
Where am I supposed to be?

962
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,280
I'm confused.

963
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,800
Let me go.

964
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,220
It's a tug-of-war.

965
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,360
Oh, no.

966
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,240
Oh, no.

967
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,280
Oh, no.

968
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,840
Oh.

969
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,880
Checkpoint.

970
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,140
Jump over.

971
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,920
And then we'll just lower you down.

972
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,260
Okay.

973
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,900
What order are we in?

974
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,880
We should untangle real quick.

975
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,940
I am here.

976
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,140
I can't tell at all.

977
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:39,940
I think... Oh, there.

978
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,220
Okay, we're good.

979
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,380
How does this one person...

980
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,940
Oh, we have to stack maybe again?

981
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,460
I think that's just a jump.

982
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,360
I think you jump.

983
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,620
Why would they do that if it weren't for the level design?

984
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:52,980
Maybe.

985
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Oh, I got it.

986
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,300
Okay, we got it.

987
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,800
We got it.

988
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,680
Okay, let's try it again.

989
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,140
Oh, no.

990
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,140
We have to be untangled.

991
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,560
This is so romantic.

992
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,720
What if...

993
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,620
What if two or three of us jump at the same time and get weight on the other side?

994
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:13,940
What if two or three of us jump at the same time and get weight on the other side?

995
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,660
Two of you guys jump.

996
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,200
Let me free.

997
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,400
Let me free.

998
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,620
Yeah.

999
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,400
One direction and we really did it without thinking.

1000
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:24,720
One direction and we really did it without thinking.

1001
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,920
Who's next to me?

1002
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,900
Oh, my God.

1003
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,500
How did you guys get tangled like that?

1004
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,140
Wait, what the heck?

1005
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,780
I don't know actually.

1006
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,100
Oh, we're making a star.

1007
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,560
Wait, I'm supposed to be over here.

1008
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,300
Wait, where am I?

1009
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,380
Oh, I'm supposed to be over here.

1010
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:42,760
Okay.

1011
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,820
You are still tangled.

1012
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,780
There's some double looping going on on that rope.

1013
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,620
I'm pretty sure.

1014
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,360
Really?

1015
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:50,680
Where?

1016
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:51,860
Okay.

1017
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,780
All yours.

1018
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,080
I think you guys have to jump off of my head for this.

1019
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,880
Eight, four, and six have to jump together.

1020
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,480
Yeah.

1021
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,540
We should get closer so that they don't get pulled back.

1022
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,560
Oh, my God.

1023
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,620
I love the cascade effect.

1024
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,980
We did it.

1025
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,060
We need to pull these cats up.

1026
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,840
Pull them up.

1027
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:23,780
Okay.

1028
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,540
Now what?

1029
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,380
Untangle.

1030
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,060
All right.

1031
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,240
How come it's always the tail end that's tangled up like that?

1032
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:33,600
How come?

1033
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,860
I don't know.

1034
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,560
What are you guys doing?

1035
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,880
We're fine over here.

1036
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,460
Yeah, we're here.

1037
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,640
It's not me, man.

1038
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,900
Why are you guys tangling up?

1039
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,720
Guys, why are you guys tangling up?

1040
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,660
It's because I have to be put down.

1041
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,500
Pink and orange.

1042
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,240
Okay, fine.

1043
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,420
If you're so perfect over here then, why don't you be a little bit more tangled?

1044
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:58,900
Okay?

1045
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,420
Yeah.

1046
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,300
Yeah, yeah.

1047
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,060
You tell them.

1048
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,420
Yeah.

1049
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:06,810
Let's swap.

1050
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,570
Let's swap places.

1051
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,110
Okay, okay.

1052
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:08,770
Let's swap places.

1053
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:09,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1054
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,990
It'll be so tangled that we can't fall.

1055
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,390
We can do this.

1056
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,110
Yeah, yeah.

1057
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,490
It's just like the rubber bands.

1058
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,510
Oh!

1059
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,410
Do we launch somebody?

1060
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,010
No, no, no.

1061
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:23,670
Trust, trust.

1062
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,770
Tangle and jump over together.

1063
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,390
As a whole ball of yarn.

1064
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,110
We should just jump so we can be untangled.

1065
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,570
I cannot jump with Dari on my head.

1066
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,850
If we jump, we lose our keys.

1067
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,590
Oh!

1068
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,130
Okay, alright.

1069
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,970
Let's just get these guys out here first.

1070
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,270
Okay, alright.

1071
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,990
Okay, we're just gonna jump.

1072
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:45,550
We're just gonna...

1073
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,730
Alright, let's just do a jump.

1074
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,350
Let's just jump.

1075
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,950
It's not gonna work.

1076
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,370
It's not gonna work.

1077
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,490
We just need to make a little staircase.

1078
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,630
What is this?

1079
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:59,530
If we make a staircase and then we have someone fall into the gap.

1080
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,110
Yes, I have a suggestion.

1081
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:05,530
Without tangling, we do need to make a staircase and have someone on the end then jump off.

1082
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:06,370
Okay.

1083
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,630
Not like that.

1084
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,290
Hold again.

1085
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,250
That wasn't the full sentence.

1086
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,350
I got pushed, guys.

1087
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,750
Somebody pushed me.

1088
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,150
That can't be possible.

1089
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:20,650
This way, we need to have, like, in reverse order, Okay, so someone needs to be on Doki that is like...

1090
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:20,970
Oh, wait.

1091
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:21,210
Hold on.

1092
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,690
Someone needs to be under Doki.

1093
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,750
Yeah, purple under Doki.

1094
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,470
Yeah, okay.

1095
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,290
Okay, like that.

1096
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,570
But I need to go to the other side.

1097
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,250
Like that, okay.

1098
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:33,050
So if you tell me to get to the edge and then I jump, that will hopefully be enough.

1099
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:33,610
Okay.

1100
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:35,730
Oh!

1101
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,910
My goodness gracious.

1102
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,110
Okay, everyone just get in so they can fall.

1103
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,130
Where's my vacuum?

1104
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,730
The vacuum figured it out!

1105
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:42,510
The

1106
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,860
vacuum figured it out, guys.

1107
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,060
Yay!

1108
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,820
Big brain!

1109
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh, no.

1110
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,660
At least we can't die here.

1111
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,820
Yeah, we just gotta pull each other out.

1112
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,180
Yeah, we just gotta do it.

1113
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,760
We just need a couple of us to pull the others off.

1114
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,700
The people on the bottom of the stack need to walk off at the same time.

1115
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,060
Alright.

1116
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,820
So we need to all stack into a big group.

1117
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,780
Like a huge group.

1118
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,700
We just become a conglomeration and then we need to, like, walk off at the same time.

1119
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,880
Oh, okay.

1120
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,080
Okay.

1121
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,320
Um...

1122
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,200
Okay, blue and red.

1123
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,200
You walk off and I can jump.

1124
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:23,740
Oh, okay.

1125
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,980
We need to just keep going.

1126
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,700
Just you and me.

1127
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,120
I'm gonna go too.

1128
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,760
I shouldn't have had those tacos.

1129
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,120
Alright.

1130
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,760
Okay, okay, okay, guys, guys.

1131
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,920
We don't have to move, guys.

1132
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,200
Just stay still.

1133
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,880
Everybody stay still.

1134
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,480
I need you to touch the wall.

1135
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,320
I'm touching the wall.

1136
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,420
I'm making out with the wall.

1137
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,060
And then...

1138
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,780
Okay, okay.

1139
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,420
No, no, no.

1140
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,760
Rin, stay on top.

1141
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,080
I don't think Doki can.

1142
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,400
No, Snuffy has to move.

1143
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,400
And then I can jump.

1144
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
And then we all move.

1145
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,080
Oh my gosh.

1146
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,320
I literally got carried this whole time.

1147
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:12,780
Yay.

1148
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,240
Yay.

1149
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,640
Thank you so much for...

1150
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,340
Yippee!

1151
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,800
Don't touch me!

1152
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,700
No!

1153
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,780
Doki!

1154
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,400
Doki, you're gonna die!

1155
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,100
Okay.

1156
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,880
Nobody touch anyone!

1157
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,000
Oh, my...

1158
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,020
We were basically dead.

1159
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,780
Okay, we gotta keep going.

1160
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,200
We have one HP!

1161
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,400
Oh, that was Doki!

1162
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,200
This is all Doki!

1163
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,400
I'm okay!

1164
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,860
You have so much HP!

1165
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,700
Someone get on here, but don't touch me!

1166
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,980
I'm not touching you.

1167
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,860
Six feet, guys!

1168
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,120
Guys, I don't wanna...

1169
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,860
Guys, please.

1170
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,280
Me!

1171
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,760
Me!

1172
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,000
Me!

1173
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,360
Me!

1174
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,300
There's ice up there!

1175
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:02,620
It's ice!

1176
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,360
Oh, it's ice!

1177
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,520
Doki, don't touch me!

1178
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,880
Don't touch me, Doki!

1179
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,800
I'm not touching you!

1180
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,220
Yes, you are!

1181
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,560
Stop!

1182
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,680
I just wanted to touch you, Doki!

1183
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,000
I just bricked you!

1184
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,160
No, don't touch me, though.

1185
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,180
Oh, my God!

1186
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,720
Oh, my God!

1187
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,200
Stop!

1188
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:21,780
Stop!

1189
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,300
We're too close!

1190
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:22,780
We're too close!

1191
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:24,660
Stop!

1192
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,060
Stop!

1193
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,220
Stop!

1194
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,660
It's hot enough!

1195
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:28,840
Go!

1196
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,220
It's ice!

1197
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,120
It's ice!

1198
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,260
Sorry!

1199
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,160
Okay.

1200
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,560
Okay.

1201
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,260
I'm sorry!

1202
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,760
I'm trying to go back for you!

1203
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,260
Okay, you first!

1204
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,920
What does this do?

1205
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,760
Oh!

1206
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,480
Oh!

1207
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:45,740
Scoot!

1208
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,760
Scoot along a bit!

1209
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,760
Wait, how will you...

1210
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,040
Well, I need you to scoot so I can go...

1211
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,980
No, I need you to...

1212
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,160
Actually, this works!

1213
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,500
This works!

1214
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,180
No!

1215
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,740
Nobody touch me!

1216
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,060
Don't touch!

1217
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:06,880
Where?

1218
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,480
Sorry!

1219
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,000
Sorry!

1220
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,140
Oh!

1221
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,480
Hey, we didn't touch, though!

1222
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,720
I think you did because...

1223
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,200
Oh!

1224
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:14,300
Oh!

1225
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,000
Oh!

1226
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,300
Oh!

1227
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,180
There we go!

1228
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:19,960
There we go!

1229
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,460
Don't touch me!

1230
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,960
Try not to jump off early if you're on the right because you leave your friend behind.

1231
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:26,520
There we go.

1232
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:27,540
Oh!

1233
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,640
The slip and slide there!

1234
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,140
Uh!

1235
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:32,620
Uh!

1236
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,000
Uh!

1237
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,800
Guys, just...

1238
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,600
Scoot!

1239
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,160
Scoot!

1240
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,160
Scoot!

1241
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,840
Just a little jump!

1242
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,760
Just a little jump!

1243
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:39,680
Okay?

1244
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,480
There we go!

1245
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,160
There we go!

1246
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,980
Hold on!

1247
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,540
We jump at the same time!

1248
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,100
Oh!

1249
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,360
Oh!

1250
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:46,780
Oh!

1251
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,120
Sorry!

1252
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,300
Y'all got a button!

1253
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,780
I know what those words mean.

1254
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,260
Three... Two... One...

1255
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,060
Jump!

1256
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:56,740
Oh!

1257
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,060
Ouch!

1258
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,260
Nice!

1259
00:43:59,380 --> 00:43:59,720
Nice!

1260
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,280
Everything is fun!

1261
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,460
We each get a button, I guess?

1262
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,700
Yeah, I think so.

1263
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,260
Gentle!

1264
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,420
Gentle!

1265
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,280
Gentle!

1266
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:07,800
Stop!

1267
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,000
I'm looking at you!

1268
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:09,840
I know!

1269
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,420
I know!

1270
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:11,920
Yay!

1271
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,820
Let's go!

1272
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:15,600
Okay.

1273
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,940
Oh my god!

1274
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:18,640
She looks so pretty!

1275
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,440
Oh my god!

1276
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,020
I'm doing my part.

1277
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:23,780
Don't touch me!

1278
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,500
I'm not even pressing anything at this point.

1279
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,520
Oh my god!

1280
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,360
Oh!

1281
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,560
Oh!

1282
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,380
It doesn't kill you!

1283
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:33,820
That's so good!

1284
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,600
Ouch!

1285
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:36,720
Doki!

1286
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:37,980
Hahaha!

1287
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,100
Aim!

1288
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,280
There you go!

1289
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,340
Hmm... Hmm...

1290
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,420
Hmm...

1291
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,600
Hahaha!

1292
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,300
That's just the way!

1293
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,300
Wait!

1294
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:53,940
I twirled!

1295
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,620
Oh my god!

1296
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,440
Yippee!

1297
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:57,980
Yippee!

1298
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,460
Yay!

1299
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,900
I'm sweating!

1300
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:03,900
Me too!

1301
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,840
I'm taking off my hoodie.

1302
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,320
Holy!

1303
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,240
My palms are moist!

1304
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,680
Oh no!

1305
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,440
Not what I want to hear in this game.

1306
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,780
Oh, it's this again.

1307
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:15,960
We're already tangled.

1308
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:16,960
It's been three seconds.

1309
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,000
Oh, we can touch again!

1310
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,400
We are mostly untangled, except for Mint and Doki.

1311
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,300
I'm not tangled!

1312
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,300
I'm exactly where I was!

1313
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,120
There we go.

1314
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,200
Easy peasy.

1315
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,660
Snuffy, is this you?

1316
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,600
Snuffy, am I touching you right now?

1317
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,440
The pink one.

1318
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,980
Oh, you're even more pink!

1319
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,320
Oh!

1320
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,560
Wait, who am I touching?

1321
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:39,880
That's Rin.

1322
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,600
Oh, hi Rin!

1323
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,320
Hi Rin!

1324
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,780
Okay, and then I'm up here.

1325
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,080
Good.

1326
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,760
You gotta jump with us.

1327
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1328
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,240
Just don't...

1329
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,220
Oh, sorry!

1330
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:56,540
Hahaha!

1331
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:57,700
Hahaha!

1332
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,020
Hahaha!

1333
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:58,600
Stop it!

1334
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,420
Alright, the two of us...

1335
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:02,960
Okay...

1336
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,780
Alright, back to the line.

1337
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,400
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1338
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,580
Okay, alright.

1339
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,420
I went a little too... I was a little too eager.

1340
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:11,820
I'm sorry.

1341
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,140
There we go.

1342
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:14,580
Okay.

1343
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:15,820
Yeah.

1344
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,480
Don't go down the hole.

1345
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,020
I'm sorry.

1346
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,720
Don't fall down the hole.

1347
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,540
Don't fall down.

1348
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,040
Just make the jump.

1349
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,200
If you don't make it, we all die.

1350
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,620
Did you not get it?

1351
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,480
Backwards.

1352
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,760
I don't know what to do.

1353
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,100
Three of us have to jump lower.

1354
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,040
I think a few of us have to jump lower.

1355
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,660
There we go.

1356
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:45,540
Guys.

1357
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,580
What the fuck am I looking at here?

1358
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:48,980
Alright.

1359
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,340
I think we gotta untangle first.

1360
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,540
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

1361
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,120
I am supposed to be...

1362
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,500
So, yellow, red, green...

1363
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,760
Aren't I at the end?

1364
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,780
Are we at the end?

1365
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,520
We were almost untangled.

1366
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,580
We were almost... okay.

1367
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,580
There we go, there we go, there we go.

1368
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,560
Okay.

1369
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:07,500
Okay.

1370
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,420
Try again.

1371
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,240
Alright.

1372
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,060
This is it.

1373
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:14,880
One more time.

1374
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,080
This is it.

1375
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,720
Gray, orange, and green should all go?

1376
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:21,580
Yeah.

1377
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:22,300
Yeah.

1378
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,820
Green can go, but not gray.

1379
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,120
Wait.

1380
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,260
Three, two, one.

1381
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:28,700
Who's going?

1382
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:29,540
Go.

1383
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:30,900
Oh!

1384
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,540
Why did we all go?

1385
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:35,480
Why?

1386
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,560
That was so...

1387
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,400
That was so close.

1388
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,020
Why did we all go?

1389
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,420
We got that.

1390
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:40,960
We got that.

1391
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,740
I think everyone does need to be going, yeah.

1392
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:44,820
Everyone.

1393
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:45,660
Okay.

1394
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:46,720
Okay.

1395
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:47,700
No, no.

1396
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,340
I don't think everybody.

1397
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,820
I think it has to be like the top four walk off.

1398
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,800
There's enough weight on the other side.

1399
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,120
It's definitely more than one person.

1400
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,140
I think we need three people to pull the rest of us across.

1401
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1402
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,100
Alright, I'm losing my fucking mind at this music right now.

1403
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,100
Normally,

1404
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,760
so I kind of like it.

1405
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,280
I'm at peace.

1406
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,760
Okay, somebody is not where they're supposed to be.

1407
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,640
I should be in the back.

1408
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,320
Or the front, I guess.

1409
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,900
The two M's are at the same end.

1410
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,120
Alright.

1411
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,120
Okay, now this is a lot more tangled.

1412
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,240
Okay, here we go.

1413
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:27,940
Okay.

1414
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,520
There we go, there we go.

1415
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,000
Okay, purple, then red, then yellow.

1416
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,000
Now we climb.

1417
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,820
I cannot allow you in.

1418
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,160
Now we climb.

1419
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1420
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:40,960
Climber.

1421
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,240
Climber.

1422
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,500
Okay, I'm as far as I can go.

1423
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,140
Tippy pixel tip.

1424
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,280
Look at how much room you have.

1425
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,020
Holy shit.

1426
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,600
You can't miss.

1427
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,360
Okay, so it's probably like...

1428
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,260
Okay, so it's right there.

1429
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,120
Just walk.

1430
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,620
Just walk.

1431
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,140
Just walk.

1432
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:01,780
Okay.

1433
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:02,600
Right.

1434
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:04,860
Ahhh!

1435
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,220
No!

1436
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,040
How did that happen?

1437
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,160
What?

1438
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,520
We all had to keep walking forward.

1439
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,040
I'm gonna be sick.

1440
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:17,860
I'm gonna be sick.

1441
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,320
What?

1442
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,320
What's going on?

1443
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,460
Oh, Christ.

1444
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,020
Yeah, you have to keep pulling right.

1445
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,660
Somebody's sand was off the keyboard.

1446
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,920
We all gotta pull our parts.

1447
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,580
Okay, stack, stack, stack!

1448
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,800
Okay, stack, stack, stack!

1449
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:38,580
Okay.

1450
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,620
Stack, stack, stack, stack.

1451
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:42,180
Holy shit.

1452
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,340
I can't, I can't.

1453
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:48,940
Oh, there we go, there we go.

1454
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,880
Just keep walking.

1455
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:52,820
Okay, cool.

1456
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:53,060
Okay.

1457
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,680
We can't lose this.

1458
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,560
We can't lose this.

1459
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,460
Just hold D.

1460
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,140
Just hold D.

1461
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:00,760
Just hold D.

1462
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,680
Don't stop.

1463
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:03,560
Ahhh!

1464
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,600
That's been a miscommunication.

1465
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,540
We're so done!

1466
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:14,940
Yeah!

1467
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,000
We're so done!

1468
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,380
I'm almost there!

1469
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,060
Okay.

1470
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:22,960
In order, I guess.

1471
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,400
In order, in order.

1472
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,880
Okay, we figured it out.

1473
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,380
Wait, I'm behind you.

1474
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,320
Okay, Juniper at the end.

1475
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,300
Alright, here we go.

1476
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:36,500
Nice!

1477
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:36,880
Oh!

1478
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,980
Wait, we need this, we need this!

1479
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,160
Wait, it has to be like this.

1480
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,000
Yeah, it has to be like this.

1481
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:44,720
Don't jump!

1482
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,160
Go back, go back, go back, go back.

1483
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,780
Go back, go back, go back.

1484
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:50,900
Okay.

1485
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,700
Okay, only one person needs to...

1486
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,320
Oh, look, I can swing you!

1487
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,200
Oh, that's so gross.

1488
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,700
Oh my god.

1489
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,380
You just jump.

1490
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,700
I am trying to jump but the weight is fucking me up.

1491
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,100
Are you sure it shouldn't be the person on the end?

1492
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:04,440
Oh, Rin.

1493
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,180
Help me.

1494
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:08,920
Help me.

1495
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,500
I cannot jump.

1496
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,000
One has to be tangled.

1497
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:13,860
One has to be tangled.

1498
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,180
Oh, Jessica.

1499
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,480
No, I think it's just the dangle, right?

1500
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,640
And then the next person goes.

1501
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,800
Yeah, I think there's someone at the end, maybe.

1502
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,200
Because then we can easily pull them up.

1503
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,240
I feel like there should be someone in the middle, no?

1504
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,140
Because I cannot see...

1505
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:28,800
What's the puzzle?

1506
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:29,720
I didn't see it.

1507
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,220
There's a button at the dangle.

1508
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,940
No, there's the key in the middle.

1509
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,920
I don't know if you have to hit the buttons or what.

1510
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,600
Or avoid them.

1511
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:38,660
Oh, frick.

1512
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:39,860
That's gross.

1513
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,320
I kind of hate that.

1514
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,000
We probably got boxed in one.

1515
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,920
For a reason.

1516
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,940
I think the buttons are bad news.

1517
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,840
Maybe it's like as many people as possible jump across and then one goes down and you have to counterbalance it between the two.

1518
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,140
Let's try.

1519
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,960
Okay, pull me up.

1520
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,180
Thank you, man.

1521
00:51:59,200 --> 00:51:59,860
Don't go too far.

1522
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,040
We're tangled up, but we did it.

1523
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,300
Alright, now we jump across.

1524
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,120
Let's just get maybe four of us.

1525
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,680
Oh my goodness gracious.

1526
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,880
Why do I go too far?

1527
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,260
Keep jumping.

1528
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,180
Jump like this.

1529
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,640
Oh, sorry.

1530
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,840
Now we walk across.

1531
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,780
And then we jump.

1532
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,220
Okay.

1533
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,160
If we...

1534
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,120
Go a little bit.

1535
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,300
Oh, and then we can drag.

1536
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,800
Yeah, okay.

1537
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,320
Juniper, don't jump.

1538
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:33,980
Just fall.

1539
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,220
Sorry, I'm gonna dangle, bros.

1540
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:38,820
I'm going down.

1541
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,760
Dangle, dangle, dangle.

1542
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,580
I told you the buttons were bad news!

1543
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:49,160
I said the buttons were bad news!

1544
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,040
The buttons are a trick!

1545
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,280
I told you!

1546
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,740
I think we're right.

1547
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,560
We do need to be super tangled so that the line is shorter.

1548
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1549
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:00,840
Dangle her!

1550
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,360
Emily, you go down.

1551
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,200
We gotta pull up.

1552
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:06,780
We gotta pull up.

1553
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,280
Three more apart.

1554
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,260
Wait, jump on top of someone, right?

1555
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,560
So I'm connected to one and two.

1556
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,140
One and two seem to be farther apart.

1557
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,160
The farther apart you are, the shorter the line.

1558
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,560
Okay, orange and yellow.

1559
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,160
No, no!

1560
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,720
Okay, I can't jump!

1561
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,460
I can't jump!

1562
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,120
I can't jump!

1563
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,000
It's so noisy!

1564
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,280
Okay.

1565
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,420
Keep walking.

1566
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,740
Okay, there we go.

1567
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,660
There we go.

1568
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,560
Alright, now come together.

1569
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,040
Pull up the baby.

1570
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,520
Okay.

1571
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,480
Okay.

1572
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,320
Okay, itch, itch.

1573
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,200
Okay, there we go.

1574
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,300
Alright,

1575
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:54,850
nice.

1576
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,090
Oh my goodness.

1577
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:58,390
We've done the impossible.

1578
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:00,250
Oh my god, we actually did it.

1579
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,490
Oh my god, we're so smart.

1580
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:07,150
Am I the only one tall enough to ride the ride?

1581
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:12,870
You just got carried the whole time.

1582
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:15,190
Get in the backpack.

1583
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:17,510
Isn't that so fun?

1584
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:19,850
Amelie, can you talk for me?

1585
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:20,850
I need to adjust your volume.

1586
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:24,250
I couldn't even register what was happening.

1587
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:28,050
I couldn't even register what was happening.

1588
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:29,190
Test me.

1589
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:30,430
One, two, three, test me.

1590
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:31,910
That's better, thank you.

1591
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:34,430
I think I need to change Juniper, too.

1592
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:35,230
Oh, sorry.

1593
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:38,190
Oh, Sorgi.

1594
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:40,330
Oh, I have to push the box?

1595
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,170
Yeah, yeah, because you're orange.

1596
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:43,130
Hey, don't touch me.

1597
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:45,550
Sorry, I was clicking back in on your adjusting discord.

1598
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,350
I think we start over, we start over.

1599
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:48,370
No, no, no.

1600
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:49,130
Okay.

1601
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:53,830
I know us.

1602
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:54,730
We need the full help.

1603
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:56,570
Just the box.

1604
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,470
Alright, this time it's Amelie touches the box.

1605
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:00,810
Okay.

1606
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:02,490
I'm not even moving.

1607
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:03,710
Like, how are you guys hitting me?

1608
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:04,410
Oh, it's your box.

1609
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,610
Okay, you can get on the bus and we'll jump over you.

1610
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:08,770
Amelie, it's your box.

1611
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,070
It's your box.

1612
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:11,650
It's the Amelie box.

1613
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:12,890
Yeah, it's the Amelie box.

1614
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,290
We have to jump over her.

1615
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:16,090
Yeah, jump over.

1616
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:17,550
Push, push.

1617
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,350
She's collecting the trash.

1618
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:22,450
I'm sorry, I shocked you.

1619
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,750
Don't beat the trash man.

1620
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:26,890
Don't beat the trash man.

1621
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:28,130
What the?

1622
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,630
How did that even happen?

1623
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:30,890
She's rubbing her toes on her head.

1624
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:31,130
I know.

1625
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:34,850
Whacking me on my scalp.

1626
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:36,250
I only have a few brain cells.

1627
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:39,770
Oh, oh, oh.

1628
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:40,910
Wait.

1629
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,290
Oh, it's a wall that pushes us back.

1630
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,450
Oh, no.

1631
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,350
Evil wall.

1632
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:48,330
There's a hole, there's a hole.

1633
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:48,810
Go, go, go.

1634
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:49,730
There's a hole, there's a hole.

1635
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:49,930
Okay.

1636
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:51,910
Oh, it's time, time, Dicey.

1637
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:52,930
Okay, okay.

1638
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,470
Yeah, so we wait, so we wait.

1639
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:55,170
Yeah, yeah.

1640
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:57,830
Go, go, go, go.

1641
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:01,350
I think we're gonna die.

1642
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:05,070
Guys, we have one HP left, guys.

1643
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:06,710
Jump up.

1644
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:07,050
You can.

1645
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:10,190
Can you move forward?

1646
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:11,790
Keep moving, guys, keep moving.

1647
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:12,270
Keep moving, keep moving.

1648
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:19,010
We would've died anyway.

1649
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:20,350
Okay, my turn.

1650
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:21,410
Okay.

1651
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,790
Alright, it's Doki's box.

1652
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,430
It's your box now.

1653
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:26,710
Jump over my head.

1654
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:27,190
Oh, okay.

1655
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,470
How do we keep him?

1656
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:33,150
You guys gotta jump over me, guys.

1657
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:37,450
My bad, I forgot how this works.

1658
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:38,210
My box.

1659
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:40,930
Oh, shit, my bad.

1660
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:43,770
My bad, my bad.

1661
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,710
I am not moving, so you touch me.

1662
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:46,330
It's your fault.

1663
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:47,910
I'm not moving.

1664
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:52,490
There's plenty of space.

1665
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,390
No, there's not.

1666
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:54,590
You need to move forward.

1667
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,350
There's plenty of space.

1668
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:57,710
Be careful, friends.

1669
00:56:58,970 --> 00:56:59,970
Oh, no.

1670
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:01,530
Hey, guys.

1671
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:06,110
Guys, I need you guys.

1672
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:06,930
Okay, here we go.

1673
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,970
Alright, just run forward, just run forward.

1674
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:09,430
Just go.

1675
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,850
Just go, there's nothing down there.

1676
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:14,150
What do you mean there's nothing down there?

1677
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,390
Just go, Doki, go.

1678
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:17,490
Just go, Doki, go.

1679
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:17,490
What?

1680
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:17,730
Again?

1681
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:17,950
Again?

1682
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,630
Look at me, I'm like in the water right now.

1683
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:22,930
We're gonna be okay, eventually.

1684
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:26,110
We're gonna be okay, eventually.

1685
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:27,230
Come on.

1686
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:30,550
There's plenty of room, Doki, just go for it.

1687
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:31,370
There's plenty of room.

1688
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:32,850
I will.

1689
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:38,170
No, we only have three hits left.

1690
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:38,850
No!

1691
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:39,630
No!

1692
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:40,770
How so?

1693
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:43,530
I thought I could make the shot.

1694
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:46,990
Everyone, I need the room for Jesus.

1695
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:48,190
Everyone, I need the room for Jesus.

1696
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,030
Wait, how do we get the key?

1697
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:51,330
How do we?

1698
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:52,510
You gotta make a jump, I think.

1699
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:52,870
Oh.

1700
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,570
Okay, not like that.

1701
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:59,610
Oh, I didn't realize it was me at the end.

1702
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,170
You need room for Jesus.

1703
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:02,790
I think it was one of us.

1704
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:06,970
We need to save one HP, so we can stack and get the key.

1705
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:08,290
I think so, yeah.

1706
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:09,590
Yeah, I agree.

1707
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,010
Brilliant, brilliant.

1708
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:14,590
In the ideal scenario, we save all of the HP.

1709
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:18,670
No, the perfect world is asking too much for us.

1710
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:24,750
Alright, Amelie, your turn.

1711
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:25,970
Amelie.

1712
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:27,550
Rude!

1713
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:28,230
Alright.

1714
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:29,730
Alright.

1715
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:33,890
Oh!

1716
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:35,130
Doki!

1717
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,330
I didn't move!

1718
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:43,530
Yay!

1719
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:44,210
Yay!

1720
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:49,050
Alright, go, go, go!

1721
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:49,950
Nice.

1722
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:51,110
My turn.

1723
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:53,150
See, I made it.

1724
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:54,270
I'm waiting for it.

1725
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:54,750
I got nervous.

1726
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:55,670
It's okay.

1727
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,370
Alright, Snuffy, you go up.

1728
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:58,070
You push up.

1729
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,130
You have to kiss the wall.

1730
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,650
We're getting performance anxiety in people park.

1731
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:03,010
Oh!

1732
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:05,110
Go, go, go!

1733
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,470
You can make the jump.

1734
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,010
It's okay, it's okay.

1735
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:10,790
Relax, relax.

1736
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:11,890
Yeah, there you go.

1737
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:13,050
There's space.

1738
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:13,770
There's room.

1739
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:15,510
There's a lot of room, guys.

1740
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:17,230
Oh, sorry.

1741
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:19,570
Please go forward.

1742
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:19,870
Can I?

1743
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:22,830
It's okay.

1744
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,030
The wall won't hurt you.

1745
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:26,850
Yeah, you can touch the wall.

1746
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:28,410
You and me.

1747
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:30,310
It's hurting my mind.

1748
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:31,670
You gotta go up.

1749
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:34,010
A fan?

1750
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:35,170
What does this mean?

1751
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:36,430
What's gonna happen to me?

1752
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,070
What's gonna happen to that?

1753
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,550
Oh, it's just gonna push us up.

1754
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,130
Oh, but we have to be careful not to hit ourselves.

1755
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:46,270
Wait, what are we?

1756
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:48,030
Okay, I'm coming.

1757
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,730
We all know how to count, right guys?

1758
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,130
We all know how to count.

1759
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:54,250
Three...

1760
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,190
Wait, it's gonna go down into the water, right?

1761
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,250
What are we gonna do?

1762
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:03,980
What are we gonna do?

1763
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:03,980
What are we gonna do?

1764
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:04,440
Okay, okay.

1765
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,080
Just keep shimmying.

1766
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:08,740
Just keep.

1767
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:09,840
Okay, okay, okay.

1768
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,540
We're fine.

1769
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,300
We can do this.

1770
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,640
Oh.

1771
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,880
That's not too soon.

1772
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,940
Who said we can do this?

1773
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,160
We can do this.

1774
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:21,600
Yeah.

1775
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,920
Guys, we beat level 15.

1776
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,940
We can beat level 2.

1777
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,180
We got this.

1778
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:32,740
We got this.

1779
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:34,280
Okay.

1780
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,160
There we go.

1781
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,040
Make way.

1782
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:37,840
Make way.

1783
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:38,480
Ouch.

1784
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:38,900
Ouch.

1785
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:39,360
Okay.

1786
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,000
Make way.

1787
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:40,820
Make way.

1788
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:42,740
Nice.

1789
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:43,420
Alright.

1790
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,060
Make way.

1791
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:44,800
Make way.

1792
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,440
Make way.

1793
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:46,960
Make way.

1794
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:48,880
Okay.

1795
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,520
I will raid your box.

1796
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:52,380
Thank you.

1797
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,220
You're welcome.

1798
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,120
I don't think she trusts us on making the jump.

1799
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:57,040
I don't think so.

1800
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,600
I don't think she trusts us in parkour.

1801
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,980
Is the thing gonna...

1802
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:03,860
Is the thing going?

1803
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,020
It's kind of like...

1804
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,720
There it is.

1805
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,240
Okay.

1806
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,040
I'll grab the key so don't come through.

1807
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,540
I'm staying completely still.

1808
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,160
Wait.

1809
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:13,520
Wait there.

1810
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,140
Oh, okay.

1811
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:14,740
I'll wait there.

1812
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,240
I'll wait here.

1813
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,080
Wait.

1814
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:16,260
Wait.

1815
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:16,460
Wait.

1816
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:16,640
Yeah.

1817
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,280
Do not continue, friends.

1818
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:18,900
Do not continue.

1819
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,220
I got slapped in the face by the wall.

1820
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:23,280
Almost pushing.

1821
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,020
Someone else has got to get the key.

1822
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,420
Good luck.

1823
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,160
Okay.

1824
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,100
I'm not believing you.

1825
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:27,980
I can't get it.

1826
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,080
I can't reach the wall anymore.

1827
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,240
I'm not touching you.

1828
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:31,820
She's touching me.

1829
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,660
You guys have to go forward.

1830
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:36,060
Guys.

1831
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:36,540
Guys.

1832
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:36,880
I don't know.

1833
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,620
Three people at once is a good idea.

1834
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:41,940
Why are you coming back off?

1835
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,040
I didn't think that was a good idea.

1836
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,500
Yes, Ripper.

1837
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,580
What is happening over there?

1838
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:47,820
Yes, Ripper.

1839
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:49,940
Figure it out.

1840
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:51,380
Alright.

1841
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:52,880
I'm gonna get smushed.

1842
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,060
She's touching me, man.

1843
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,580
Purple needs to move forward.

1844
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:57,760
Yes.

1845
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,360
Yes.

1846
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:00,820
Okay.

1847
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:02,260
Don't worry.

1848
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,140
I'm moving in 17 different directions at once.

1849
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,660
I learned how to park before.

1850
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:07,420
Okay.

1851
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:08,380
We're fine.

1852
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,920
We're fine.

1853
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,320
I'm not touching you.

1854
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:12,940
Okay.

1855
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,840
One at a time.

1856
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:17,380
Okay.

1857
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:18,080
Now jump.

1858
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:18,660
Jump.

1859
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:19,920
Go fast.

1860
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,060
I'm not trying to make you nervous.

1861
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:25,180
What was that?

1862
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,120
One last time.

1863
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,140
One last time.

1864
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,920
One last time.

1865
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:32,020
Run.

1866
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:32,660
Run.

1867
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,020
We need to do that faster.

1868
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,100
We have to jump off the thingy.

1869
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,000
Don't touch me.

1870
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:46,820
Nobody move.

1871
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,800
They're so stupid.

1872
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,380
Nobody move.

1873
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,640
Okay.

1874
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,200
Bow.

1875
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,160
Bow is your boss.

1876
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:55,480
Oh, sorry.

1877
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:57,760
Please.

1878
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,380
We had two years to practice.

1879
01:02:59,380 --> 01:02:59,920
That's so fun.

1880
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:00,580
Ow.

1881
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,500
Ow.

1882
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:04,640
Sorry.

1883
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:05,680
Sorry.

1884
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,320
Sorry.

1885
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,100
That meant my broken bones.

1886
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,220
This is not the run, bros.

1887
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,100
Yeah.

1888
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:14,940
Let's just die.

1889
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,100
We're done.

1890
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,760
Nobody move.

1891
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,660
I'm dead.

1892
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:23,980
It was like five people in a row.

1893
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:24,360
Okay.

1894
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,160
This is it.

1895
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:30,480
Chungus.

1896
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:31,360
Chungus head.

1897
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,940
Chungus head.

1898
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:37,620
I love your Chungus head.

1899
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:39,920
I'm moving.

1900
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:42,100
Keep moving a little bit.

1901
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:46,660
That was personal, I think.

1902
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:48,580
That was personal, I think.

1903
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:48,580
Alright.

1904
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,540
This is fine.

1905
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,620
That's for dying on the 15th.

1906
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:51,880
Come here.

1907
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:53,640
Push.

1908
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:55,420
We'll never forget.

1909
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:56,900
Never forget.

1910
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,380
We know what you did.

1911
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,880
Five more times.

1912
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:03,940
Okay.

1913
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:04,500
I'm going.

1914
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:04,820
I'm going.

1915
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,020
We're going together.

1916
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:08,480
We're going together.

1917
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:09,900
We're going together.

1918
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:12,800
Bow, I believe in you.

1919
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:13,440
Okay.

1920
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:13,720
Ready?

1921
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,020
Bow, I believe in you.

1922
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,180
I did it.

1923
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,040
Go, go.

1924
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:18,480
Big.

1925
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:19,460
Oh, sorry.

1926
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,300
I couldn't go forward.

1927
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1928
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:22,820
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1929
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:24,540
Alright.

1930
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:27,620
Alright.

1931
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,860
We have enough room for all three of you guys technically.

1932
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:33,660
Technically.

1933
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,940
All we gotta do is move forward.

1934
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,020
Alright, alright, alright.

1935
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:40,220
Alright, alright, alright.

1936
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,060
Are we all ready?

1937
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:42,860
Are we all ready?

1938
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:43,520
Yes.

1939
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:44,020
Oh, yeah.

1940
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,740
We got it now.

1941
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,240
Okay.

1942
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:46,480
Go.

1943
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:47,220
Go.

1944
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:47,820
Go.

1945
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:48,960
Go.

1946
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:49,460
Go.

1947
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:49,920
Go.

1948
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,060
Go.

1949
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:50,120
Go.

1950
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:50,160
Go.

1951
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:50,160
Go.

1952
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,980
Just file to the end and scoot left.

1953
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,040
Everyone, scoot left.

1954
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:54,640
Okay.

1955
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,040
Scoot.

1956
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:57,420
Scoot.

1957
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:57,820
Scoot.

1958
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:58,180
Scoot.

1959
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:58,260
Scoot.

1960
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:58,460
Scoot.

1961
01:04:59,040 --> 01:04:59,760
Please.

1962
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:00,920
Please.

1963
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:01,400
Okay.

1964
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,780
Now we get off.

1965
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,380
We just gotta...

1966
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:07,640
Go.

1967
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:08,740
Go.

1968
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:08,760
Go.

1969
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,060
Go.

1970
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:09,860
Just get inside.

1971
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:11,660
Okay.

1972
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:13,340
Yay.

1973
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,780
Oh, lord.

1974
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,920
I can feel the tension in my brain.

1975
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,660
I can feel the tension in my brain.

1976
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:31,040
I need meditation after this.

1977
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:31,760
We're gonna be such great friends after this game.

1978
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:33,060
Formation.

1979
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,400
We're still gonna be friends, you think?

1980
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,360
Formation.

1981
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,380
What is this?

1982
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,980
Is this red light, green light?

1983
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:41,960
I'm gonna piss.

1984
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,540
Someone's gonna piss.

1985
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,040
This isn't the epilepsy level, is it?

1986
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,160
Someone has to piss.

1987
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,600
Okay, go use the bathroom.

1988
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,120
Go.

1989
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:51,480
Go.

1990
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,560
Figure this out while you're gone.

1991
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:53,980
It's just red light, green light.

1992
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,080
It's Metal Gear, actually.

1993
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,120
I don't know who it was.

1994
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,640
I think it was Juniper.

1995
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:00,740
It wasn't me.

1996
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,060
I am quiet.

1997
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,820
I think it was Emily, then.

1998
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,820
Okay, so light hurts, by the way.

1999
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,220
Yeah.

2000
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,320
That's just how it is.

2001
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:14,240
As a gamer.

2002
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,460
Okay, so...

2003
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,300
There's only like enough space.

2004
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:19,980
Unless we stack.

2005
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:22,200
We could stack, yeah.

2006
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:23,700
Yeah, I have my...

2007
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,540
Go here!

2008
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,760
Yeah, but we can't stack too high.

2009
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,040
Because there's still a little light.

2010
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,800
Oh my goodness.

2011
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,420
Sorry, I moved.

2012
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,240
Wait, what if we all just stack?

2013
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,500
Oh, that's true!

2014
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:39,960
No, I think we'll get the light.

2015
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:40,920
See, it gets small.

2016
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,240
I see.

2017
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,140
I see.

2018
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,240
I think it's groups of three, maybe.

2019
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:45,960
Or four.

2020
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,420
Get behind me!

2021
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:50,260
Wait.

2022
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,120
I for-gore.

2023
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,340
For-gore?

2024
01:06:58,980 --> 01:06:59,840
Can we do four?

2025
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:00,980
Or can we only do three?

2026
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:01,680
I think we can do four.

2027
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,320
We definitely can.

2028
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,000
We have space for four.

2029
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,140
Okay, it has to be just here.

2030
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,540
I have brain damage.

2031
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,220
I mean, after that last level.

2032
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,980
Everyone on top of your head.

2033
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:18,340
Yeah.

2034
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,440
Wait, no.

2035
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,840
I played this game right now.

2036
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,340
This is so funny.

2037
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,240
Oh, it's me.

2038
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,360
It's fine.

2039
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,080
She can solo this, I believe.

2040
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,620
Actually, no.

2041
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,800
She cannot solo this.

2042
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,460
Okay, I'm back.

2043
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,400
Okay.

2044
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:42,260
Okay.

2045
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:48,540
She can't solo it.

2046
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:53,220
The little click is so nice.

2047
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:53,920
The little click is so nice.

2048
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,640
We can get five.

2049
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:56,640
We can get five.

2050
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:57,780
Okay.

2051
01:07:58,060 --> 01:07:58,820
Oh, sorry.

2052
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:04,960
I bet we could make a perfect diamond pyramid.

2053
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:05,440
I bet we could make a perfect diamond pyramid.

2054
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:05,620
Yeah.

2055
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,760
Let's show her beautiful skills.

2056
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,360
Let's show her beautiful skills.

2057
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:12,120
Okay.

2058
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:12,820
It's not working.

2059
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,260
Do we have enough room to make a perfect diamond pyramid?

2060
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:18,680
Yeah, we can.

2061
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:19,780
There we go.

2062
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:22,740
It's beautiful.

2063
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:23,580
Wow.

2064
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:25,580
This is not a time.

2065
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,260
We can stack two people on top of us, too.

2066
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:31,580
We can stack two people on top of us, too.

2067
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:32,860
Maybe purple jump on top, too.

2068
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:34,400
Purple jump up.

2069
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,580
How does pink get up?

2070
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,000
Red jump up.

2071
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,940
Red jump up.

2072
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:39,380
Oh, sorry.

2073
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,220
And then we must realign.

2074
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:43,300
How does snuffy get up?

2075
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,620
I think maybe green makes a little room.

2076
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,400
I can move a little bit.

2077
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,920
See if red can get on top of bow.

2078
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:53,680
Oh.

2079
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,360
Oh, guys.

2080
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,040
We're getting closer.

2081
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:57,020
Okay.

2082
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,520
Let's not assemble that.

2083
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:01,760
Okay.

2084
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:03,940
Let's just do five.

2085
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,380
Let's just do five with me.

2086
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,400
We can't get too fancy.

2087
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,100
Come over here.

2088
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:09,840
Come over here.

2089
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:10,860
Okay.

2090
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,920
I want snuffy's pyramid to happen, though.

2091
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:16,600
Okay.

2092
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,820
Yeah, I'm kind of curious.

2093
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:19,660
Wait.

2094
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,080
Who's going to be at the bottom?

2095
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:21,400
Wait.

2096
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,480
Should we go bow at the bottom?

2097
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:26,900
Yes.

2098
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,440
It can be this tall.

2099
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,320
This is as tall as it can be.

2100
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:34,480
Okay.

2101
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:36,340
It needs to be...

2102
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,200
It can't be any bigger than two at the bottom.

2103
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,120
I'm pretty sure...

2104
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:40,880
Okay.

2105
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,520
Now you can stack up.

2106
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,460
Why did you lose, buddy?

2107
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,360
Why did you lose?

2108
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:58,220
We just need two different stacks.

2109
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:58,720
Please.

2110
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:01,260
We're trying to be fancy.

2111
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,100
We're trying to be fancy.

2112
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,800
But we wanted to be a beautiful pyramid.

2113
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:06,840
You pyramid haters.

2114
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:07,920
We're already beautiful.

2115
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:10,800
My bad.

2116
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,720
Pyramids aren't always worth it.

2117
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,100
That's a recent school of pyramid scheme.

2118
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,740
Here you go.

2119
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:18,900
I get it.

2120
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,640
All right.

2121
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,220
Look at that.

2122
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,440
Now we're a boring line.

2123
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,120
We can't have nice things, guys.

2124
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,760
I love boring lines.

2125
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,480
You're beautiful and efficient.

2126
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,820
Oh, my God.

2127
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,420
Oh, my God.

2128
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:35,900
Okay.

2129
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,020
Two stacks before.

2130
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,640
I still trust Bao despite her failure.

2131
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,120
My failure?

2132
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:41,960
Oh, Jesus.

2133
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,400
So what happened was...

2134
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,140
Ended so fast.

2135
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,060
No, trust me.

2136
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,160
I'm a professional.

2137
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,500
I still trust Bao.

2138
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,260
We're swapping bottoms.

2139
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,280
Goodbye.

2140
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,080
It's okay.

2141
01:10:59,160 --> 01:10:59,620
I'll catch up.

2142
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:00,420
Don't worry.

2143
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,300
He'll catch up.

2144
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,980
But will that mean I can catch up?

2145
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:10,800
I'm topping.

2146
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:11,460
I'm popping.

2147
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,360
I trust Bao.

2148
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,320
I'm on Bao.

2149
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:16,540
Give Bao a gun.

2150
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,820
Give Bao a gun.

2151
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:19,920
Okay.

2152
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:20,980
All right.

2153
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:21,260
Let's go.

2154
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,840
I would not give Bao a gun.

2155
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:26,700
Wait.

2156
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:29,960
Missing quick.

2157
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:30,980
Missing quick?

2158
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,040
You've lost it.

2159
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,040
Maybe I trust Rin more.

2160
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,160
I don't know.

2161
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,680
That's a dangerous statement.

2162
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:40,540
You bitch.

2163
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:45,840
And that's what happens when you don't fully trust the one at the bottom.

2164
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,520
Maybe we should swap the bottom.

2165
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,760
I have been the one giving you my face.

2166
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:55,620
Stop fighting.

2167
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,240
Stop fighting.

2168
01:11:58,860 --> 01:11:59,480
All right.

2169
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,240
Here we go.

2170
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:02,280
Okay.

2171
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:02,940
All right.

2172
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,700
I think it has to be a line.

2173
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:05,860
It's on the other side of the level.

2174
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:08,000
It's got to be a line or it's too dangerous.

2175
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:08,480
Okay.

2176
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:08,820
Trust.

2177
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:09,160
Trust.

2178
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,460
I was throwing but now I'm going to lock in for real.

2179
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,180
I trust Bao.

2180
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,960
Let's realign this to be a perfect line.

2181
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:16,540
Yeah.

2182
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:16,840
Yeah.

2183
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:18,300
I trust Bao.

2184
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:20,620
Okay.

2185
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:21,120
All right.

2186
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:21,840
Here we go.

2187
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,660
You're getting awfully close there, Bao.

2188
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,780
You're getting awfully close there.

2189
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,720
Get up.

2190
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:31,560
Oh, my God.

2191
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:32,420
Okay.

2192
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:34,580
Holy shit.

2193
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,060
I don't like it.

2194
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:38,460
I don't like it.

2195
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:39,740
What about this down area?

2196
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,040
How the fuck does this work?

2197
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:43,540
Checkpoint.

2198
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,660
Thank God.

2199
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,400
They knew deep down at this level.

2200
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:50,060
Oh, nice.

2201
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,220
I think we have to go back.

2202
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,560
We have to do the trust run.

2203
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:57,740
More people have got to get people over there.

2204
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:58,480
Okay.

2205
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:58,880
It's fine.

2206
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,020
Hold on.

2207
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:00,420
Hold on.

2208
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:02,260
You got to run.

2209
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,180
I'm sprinting.

2210
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,360
You have trapped me on the platform.

2211
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:08,280
Okay.

2212
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:08,500
I'm good.

2213
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,680
We can stack this up.

2214
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:11,980
We can stack this up technically.

2215
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,420
We can stack this up.

2216
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,500
I don't trust you, Doki.

2217
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,120
Okay.

2218
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,240
See.

2219
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,000
I told you.

2220
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,040
I told you we can stack this up.

2221
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,580
I can't go downstairs.

2222
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,360
Let's try.

2223
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:29,720
Thank God almighty for the checkpoint.

2224
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:33,580
More than we needed it.

2225
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,780
We're going again.

2226
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,300
That was so funny.

2227
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,440
We have to move the camera over, I think.

2228
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,000
Yeah.

2229
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,640
Someone has to move the camera over.

2230
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,440
I'll move the camera.

2231
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:42,820
Okay.

2232
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:47,160
Can I?

2233
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:47,820
Can I?

2234
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:48,780
No.

2235
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:50,660
The camera.

2236
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:50,940
Yeah.

2237
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,380
I need more people to come in.

2238
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,740
Maybe more people down here.

2239
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:54,940
Okay.

2240
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:56,120
Everyone get on top of me.

2241
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:59,720
We just got to stack all the way up.

2242
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:01,120
There's no light that's going to hurt us.

2243
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:01,700
Trust me.

2244
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,820
All you have to do is get on top of me.

2245
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:04,520
Yeah.

2246
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,280
I don't know.

2247
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,700
I don't know about it.

2248
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,220
Two stacks of four.

2249
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:11,500
No way we lose these.

2250
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,100
Keep stacking.

2251
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:13,920
Keep stacking.

2252
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:14,700
Okay.

2253
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,180
Green move a little bit forward.

2254
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:18,100
Yup.

2255
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:18,720
There we go.

2256
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,580
And then purple move forward.

2257
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:22,820
Okay.

2258
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:23,020
Wait.

2259
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:23,300
Why?

2260
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,020
We're ready.

2261
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:24,780
Okay.

2262
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:25,680
Are you ready?

2263
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:26,680
Next one.

2264
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:27,920
Next one.

2265
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:28,360
Next one.

2266
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,080
Purple move forward a little.

2267
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,780
Purple move forward a little.

2268
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:32,520
Go.

2269
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:32,940
Go.

2270
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:33,120
Go.

2271
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:33,220
Go.

2272
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:33,660
Wait.

2273
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,440
It's too late.

2274
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,920
As soon as it disappears.

2275
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:38,840
Yeah.

2276
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:38,960
Yeah.

2277
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:39,040
Yeah.

2278
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:39,700
Okay.

2279
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:40,920
Go.

2280
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,500
What?

2281
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,620
I hate no way.

2282
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:55,760
I hate no way.

2283
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:56,900
I hate no way.

2284
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:05,560
Trust me.

2285
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:06,120
Hand me the gun.

2286
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,260
Put it in my hand.

2287
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,600
Judge, jury, and executioner.

2288
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,320
That was so evil.

2289
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:15,300
We just hug the left wall after we get over.

2290
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:15,820
Yeah.

2291
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:16,540
Just hug the left wall.

2292
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:17,600
We're going to fall and then not move.

2293
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:18,220
Yeah.

2294
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:18,440
Yeah.

2295
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:19,160
After this one.

2296
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:19,680
After this one.

2297
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:20,660
And...

2298
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:21,960
Go!

2299
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,420
We're just going to fall and not move.

2300
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:26,900
Left.

2301
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:27,220
Left.

2302
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:30,900
Okay.

2303
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:31,440
Now go.

2304
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:31,920
Go.

2305
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:33,460
No.

2306
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,160
Let's go.

2307
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:34,700
Let's go.

2308
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:34,960
Let's go.

2309
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:35,320
Let's go.

2310
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:35,340
Wait.

2311
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:35,880
Wait.

2312
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:39,740
Easy game.

2313
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:42,100
Easy game.

2314
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:42,180
Easy.

2315
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:43,540
It's so easy.

2316
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,200
What the fuck?

2317
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,800
They did that so hard.

2318
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,160
Every man for themselves.

2319
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,020
You can't.

2320
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,120
You guys all just ran.

2321
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,100
What is this?

2322
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:57,640
Don't be on it.

2323
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:01,100
This is going to go great, I think.

2324
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:02,080
Yeah.

2325
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,560
I think there's going to be an obstacle over there.

2326
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:04,140
We're sailing.

2327
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:06,040
Line.

2328
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:06,820
Line.

2329
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:07,140
Line.

2330
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:07,480
Line.

2331
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:08,160
Thank you.

2332
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,320
Ohh.

2333
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:10,680
Watch out.

2334
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:12,820
Oooo.

2335
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,920
First try baby.

2336
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:16,960
We're gaming.

2337
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:17,860
We're gaming now.

2338
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:19,280
So big it didn't touch her.

2339
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:24,580
We have to sass.

2340
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,560
We have to sass.

2341
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:26,400
Okay.

2342
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,460
But we're getting there.

2343
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:28,020
Yeah.

2344
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:28,900
That was pretty good.

2345
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:31,040
Okay.

2346
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:31,500
Line.

2347
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,080
Line.

2348
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,080
That was our first one too.

2349
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,080
Does anyone else...

2350
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,460
Look at the wrong color.

2351
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,120
Part the middle!

2352
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:38,760
Part the middle!

2353
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,360
Okay.

2354
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:40,800
Okay.

2355
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,500
Now to the left.

2356
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:47,840
Left!

2357
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:48,580
Left!

2358
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:49,080
Left!

2359
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:49,920
Left!

2360
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:50,660
Left!

2361
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:51,700
To the left!

2362
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,080
To the left!

2363
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:55,780
To the left!

2364
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:56,960
To the left!

2365
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,020
Oh wait, we have to stay in the middle.

2366
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:00,960
Yeah, yeah.

2367
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,260
When it starts going down.

2368
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,320
Okay, so let's stack in the middle.

2369
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:06,780
Line!

2370
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:07,980
Line!

2371
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,200
Line!

2372
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:12,320
I'm thinking you guys are specifically yelling at me.

2373
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:13,020
And calling me out.

2374
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:13,520
What?

2375
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:14,000
What's the middle?

2376
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,340
We're yelling at everybody.

2377
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:18,740
Now we have to stack in the middle.

2378
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,500
Stack in the middle!

2379
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,640
Stack in the middle!

2380
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:25,220
Stack in the middle!

2381
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:25,780
There we go.

2382
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,220
Oh my god.

2383
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,040
Our simulation will come next.

2384
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:31,960
That's it?

2385
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:33,560
Oh my god.

2386
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:34,780
Yay!

2387
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:44,760
You better hurry up!

2388
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:45,980
You better hurry up!

2389
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,000
When you get the key and you put it...

2390
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,820
You better do a flip!

2391
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:53,320
Okay.

2392
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,400
It's time to put the key in the hole.

2393
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:01,580
I'm playing hot potato with the key.

2394
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:05,240
I feel like the hardest part was getting that key in the hole.

2395
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,480
Wait, was that really timed chat?

2396
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,060
Or am I crazy?

2397
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,060
No, they were fucking with us.

2398
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:12,160
Oh no!

2399
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,260
I've got utility.

2400
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:16,680
What's the skill?

2401
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:17,640
Okay.

2402
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,420
Bow you don't suck, bow you don't suck!

2403
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:22,840
Oh, okay.

2404
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,200
Oh god, what is this?

2405
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,260
Whoa!

2406
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:25,860
Whoa!

2407
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,260
Wait, this is so cool!

2408
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:30,740
Three, two...

2409
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:31,820
What's happening here?

2410
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:33,480
What is this?

2411
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:33,840
Oh!

2412
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:37,140
What the?

2413
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,360
How are you supposed to do this?

2414
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:39,940
We have to be in line.

2415
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,000
We have to be in line.

2416
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:43,680
Wow!

2417
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:47,200
So everybody is going to suck in the line.

2418
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,740
Just jump, just jump.

2419
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,600
Anyone plays suck, you suck.

2420
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,160
No, you suck.

2421
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,900
I suck, you suck.

2422
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,820
Each of us holds square, guys.

2423
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:57,140
Oh, sorry.

2424
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,660
Each of us holds...

2425
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:02,180
Here we go!

2426
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:06,640
You're supposed to wait for us.

2427
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:06,940
Yay!

2428
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:11,720
We have to be all sucked up.

2429
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:13,060
Suck.

2430
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,720
My mind hurts.

2431
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:17,000
This one blows my mind.

2432
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:17,920
I don't even know what this is.

2433
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,660
Okay, so...

2434
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,580
Bow gonna suck.

2435
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,140
I suck.

2436
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,520
We all suck together.

2437
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,180
And then Bow pushes us forward.

2438
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:27,220
Huh?

2439
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:29,780
So we're all gripped up.

2440
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:32,020
And then she pushes...

2441
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:32,380
What?

2442
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,320
Yeah, we're all gripped up.

2443
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:36,500
Okay, we lost our platforms.

2444
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,640
Alright, now...

2445
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,300
Do I have to be on the end?

2446
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,980
Because I don't know how to join the suck.

2447
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,700
No, no, no.

2448
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,580
You all go face right side.

2449
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:47,380
You all face right.

2450
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,120
And then I hold you guys.

2451
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:50,760
Yeah, yeah.

2452
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,100
And then we all hug each other like...

2453
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,440
Like we're friends.

2454
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:55,120
What?

2455
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,780
And then there you go.

2456
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,540
Now you go into the fucking void.

2457
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,000
But how does that help us avoid the wall?

2458
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,100
Wait, how is that gonna help?

2459
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,660
Yeah, how do we avoid the wall?

2460
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,980
Oh my god.

2461
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:10,880
You guys are sucking in mid-air.

2462
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,240
I love it.

2463
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,020
I love it too.

2464
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,640
Are we creating a perpetual motion machine?

2465
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:18,380
I don't understand.

2466
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,340
Physics kneels before Pico Park 2.

2467
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:22,920
Okay.

2468
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,140
Do you have like a zigzag pattern?

2469
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:25,860
No, no, no.

2470
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,480
So we leave 24-7 suck?

2471
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:29,380
In front of the car.

2472
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:31,640
If we do need to be in a line...

2473
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:32,440
Why wouldn't it work?

2474
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,700
The person on the end of the line needs to be on the far right hand side of the platform.

2475
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:38,360
So when the platform goes up, they don't collide with the block.

2476
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:43,340
So they have to hold everybody else off the platform while standing on the very end of the platform by themselves.

2477
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,320
I'm pretty sure.

2478
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:46,960
That's how you suck.

2479
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,280
Yeah, we all need to suck real hard.

2480
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:52,560
We all face the same direction, guys, while you're sucking.

2481
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,080
Face the same direction, everybody.

2482
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,520
Me as well?

2483
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,220
The end as well?

2484
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:58,000
Yeah, yeah.

2485
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:01,400
Yes, you all face and then you push us out.

2486
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,700
You push us up.

2487
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,220
The rest of us do not move.

2488
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,520
Don't stop sucking.

2489
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,520
I have not stopped sucking yet.

2490
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,540
I'm literally crying.

2491
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:11,220
I see the mission.

2492
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:12,820
I'm literally crying.

2493
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:14,240
Oh my god.

2494
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:17,240
Okay.

2495
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:20,900
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2496
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:26,440
Oh, stop this.

2497
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:27,560
Oh, I stayed alive.

2498
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:29,000
I see the mission.

2499
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:29,700
I see it.

2500
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,820
I see it now.

2501
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:31,400
I see it now.

2502
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:32,960
We gotta reverse the suck now.

2503
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:33,320
Alright.

2504
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:38,120
Okay.

2505
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,100
I don't wanna be on the end.

2506
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,740
Please, please.

2507
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:44,020
I don't wanna be on the end.

2508
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,880
Could you let me go for a second?

2509
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:47,880
You guys ready?

2510
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,540
Do not move, guys.

2511
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:52,400
Do not move, everybody.

2512
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:53,460
Okay.

2513
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:55,900
We're sucking.

2514
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,680
Alright, and then we turn around.

2515
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,880
Once we're here?

2516
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:01,480
Yeah.

2517
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:02,200
Okay, turn.

2518
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,660
You guys all turn around.

2519
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,460
I got this.

2520
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,780
I got this.

2521
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,380
Here we go.

2522
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:11,580
Woo!

2523
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,080
Oh no!

2524
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:15,120
Oh no!

2525
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:15,760
Oh no!

2526
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,680
What the...

2527
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,540
I didn't know I had to be on the end like that!

2528
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,020
I didn't know I had to be on the end like that!

2529
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,020
Okay, I got you guys.

2530
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,560
Wait, which way is it?

2531
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,640
Oh wait, I'll be on this side.

2532
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:31,200
Okay, here we go.

2533
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:35,800
Push, push, push up so we can connect.

2534
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:36,160
Alright.

2535
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:37,420
Here we go.

2536
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,660
No one let go.

2537
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,040
No one move.

2538
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,700
I'll never let you go.

2539
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,280
You're trolling.

2540
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,260
I'm trying to let you go.

2541
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:47,100
You're trolling.

2542
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:48,420
Yeah!

2543
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,120
Stop sucking!

2544
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,000
Stop sucking!

2545
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:54,600
Okay, go, go.

2546
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:57,840
You gotta really edge back here, okay?

2547
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,140
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

2548
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:01,520
Nice, nice, nice.

2549
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,040
Big, big, huge...

2550
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:05,760
We are so back.

2551
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,720
We made it.

2552
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:07,760
Yay!

2553
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,600
Oh my god, I saw what we did.

2554
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,000
Yippee!

2555
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:17,100
Yay!

2556
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,280
We sucked the victory!

2557
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,060
My brain.

2558
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:25,960
We sucked so hard.

2559
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,880
I can feel the pressure on my brain.

2560
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:29,560
Me too.

2561
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:33,000
I feel like my brain just got sucked.

2562
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,300
Wait, remember what?

2563
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:35,920
Remember?

2564
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,020
Why is there a timer?

2565
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,800
Just remember your own spot!

2566
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:41,960
Okay, remember the colors, maybe?

2567
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,860
What am I remembering?

2568
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,640
I already forgot!

2569
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:46,440
Huh?

2570
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,820
Okay, I'm here.

2571
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:51,380
I'm here.

2572
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,360
Wait, I was here.

2573
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:53,960
I was down here.

2574
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:56,840
I was literally just doing this.

2575
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,480
Okay, now we're kissing.

2576
01:23:59,020 --> 01:23:59,920
We are kissing.

2577
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,080
Oh my god.

2578
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,380
It's only like...

2579
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:05,740
13, 12...

2580
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:07,600
Am I here?

2581
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,900
I think I'm here.

2582
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:09,980
Wait, what?

2583
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:13,540
You have to remove the blocks.

2584
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:14,960
You have to remove the blocks as well.

2585
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,840
Oh, we have to remove the blocks.

2586
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,540
How close are we?

2587
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:20,720
Oh.

2588
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,260
Guys, I don't see it.

2589
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:25,620
Okay, I got it.

2590
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,820
We are supposed to have every single one of our mistakes.

2591
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:28,400
Brilliant.

2592
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,300
I like how it...

2593
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:30,380
Wow.

2594
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,000
Wow.

2595
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,580
You were so fucking loud.

2596
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:42,920
You were so fucking loud.

2597
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:43,500
I was right!

2598
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:45,820
Remember your squares.

2599
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:46,800
Remember your squares.

2600
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:47,860
I didn't.

2601
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,900
Okay, I know what I'm doing.

2602
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:51,680
It's gonna be great.

2603
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,080
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2604
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:54,240
Okay.

2605
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:56,780
Purple's gotta push their square all the way downstairs.

2606
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:57,600
I have a box.

2607
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:58,380
I got this.

2608
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,540
I'm pretty sure I do nothing.

2609
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,580
Oh, wait, how do I...

2610
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:03,840
Oh, wait.

2611
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:04,320
No, no.

2612
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:06,060
Wait, box, come back!

2613
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,140
Box, wait!

2614
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:07,760
My box!

2615
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,540
Don't drop my box!

2616
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,560
No, my box!

2617
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,920
Wait, where was my box?

2618
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,500
Wait, I don't remember, actually.

2619
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:21,580
I don't know why I did it.

2620
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,560
Can we redo?

2621
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:25,500
Huge.

2622
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:32,200
She was begging you, and you still did it.

2623
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:32,780
Oh, I was right!

2624
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,000
Oh, I was spacing the wrong way.

2625
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,680
Yay!

2626
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:40,720
I like how the game's like...

2627
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,080
Oh, what?

2628
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,760
I have to face the right direction?

2629
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:45,340
Huh?

2630
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:47,580
I hate it here!

2631
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,400
Look!

2632
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,140
My box!

2633
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:52,000
My poor box!

2634
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,500
Tester memory.

2635
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:56,980
No, I have to keep the box down.

2636
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:57,480
Okay.

2637
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:58,840
Me.

2638
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:00,560
Me.

2639
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:01,260
Me.

2640
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:02,320
Me.

2641
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:02,540
Me.

2642
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:03,380
Me.

2643
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:03,400
Me.

2644
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:03,400
Me.

2645
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:03,480
Me.

2646
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:03,480
Me.

2647
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:03,480
Me.

2648
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:03,600
Me.

2649
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:03,840
Me.

2650
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:04,660
Me.

2651
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:07,600
Me.

2652
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:07,660
Me.

2653
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:08,580
I just need to be next to Red.

2654
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:11,960
I need to chill out with Doki, and everything is going to be okay.

2655
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:14,100
Wait, I thought I was blue for some reason.

2656
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,040
I've already messed up.

2657
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:15,720
Oh God.

2658
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:19,680
I messed it all up, Rose.

2659
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:20,860
I don't know what to do.

2660
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:23,500
I am successful, I am flourishing.

2661
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,640
What do you mean you don't know what to do?

2662
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,700
I thought I was blue for some reason.

2663
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:30,580
I was looking at bow, I was voicing on the map for no reason.

2664
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:31,940
You fool!

2665
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:36,400
I'll push the box a little bit to the right.

2666
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,240
She can't!

2667
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:40,900
She's blue!

2668
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:45,800
Oh my gosh.

2669
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,140
Amelie's just like kissing that box.

2670
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:49,020
Where's Juniper?

2671
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:52,480
I was just cussing!

2672
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,540
I was looking at the wrong person!

2673
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:57,140
I'm sorry you threw.

2674
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:58,520
I threw, bros.

2675
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:58,900
I threw.

2676
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,680
We were so close!

2677
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:05,800
That's all me, baby.

2678
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,480
Oh, okay.

2679
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:08,200
Mine's easy.

2680
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:11,700
Easy peasy.

2681
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,980
I'm here and my box is slightly here.

2682
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:16,200
I love this for me.

2683
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:16,560
Okay.

2684
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,480
I'm here.

2685
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:18,020
This one's good.

2686
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,260
Okay, I'm here.

2687
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:25,380
Me and Lime got it so easy.

2688
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,300
Easiest assignment ever.

2689
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,220
Yeah, good luck everybody else.

2690
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,400
Yeah, I get to stay here.

2691
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:35,780
It's your fault.

2692
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:35,900
It's your boss.

2693
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:38,380
What the fuck is this box doing over here?

2694
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,560
Get this box out of my face.

2695
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:41,680
Hey, don't push us.

2696
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:43,840
Okay, I'm done.

2697
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,000
Wait, I'm so close!

2698
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:47,700
Wait, please!

2699
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:49,420
Oh my god!

2700
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,720
Wait, that might be good.

2701
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:05,160
We were so close.

2702
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,480
Oh my god, so close.

2703
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,360
Oh my god.

2704
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:16,350
This is so difficult.

2705
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:17,290
Oh man.

2706
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:20,070
I don't have to do any work.

2707
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:21,250
That's nice.

2708
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:23,130
I like this one.

2709
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:24,850
Wait, did I just spawn in the right place?

2710
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:26,370
Yeah, you did.

2711
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:28,250
I'm done.

2712
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:29,350
I don't know about you guys.

2713
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:32,150
Okay, this is where I am.

2714
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:33,650
Alright.

2715
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:35,570
No, no, no!

2716
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:37,230
Wait, my box!

2717
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:39,670
Why did you take it?

2718
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:42,150
It was right where...

2719
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:42,990
Get off of me!

2720
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:46,010
Okay.

2721
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:47,590
Wait, did you...

2722
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:48,010
I'm sorry!

2723
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,450
Wait, push the blue off.

2724
01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:51,850
I'm done.

2725
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:55,210
Wait, who's taking my box?

2726
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:56,350
What?

2727
01:28:56,590 --> 01:28:57,590
Okay, okay.

2728
01:28:58,010 --> 01:29:08,710
You can take anybody's box?

2729
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:10,930
Yeah, you can just...

2730
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:13,150
You can just grab the...

2731
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:14,990
Someone snobbitized me.

2732
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:16,950
No, no.

2733
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:17,930
I'm gonna go from the left.

2734
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:19,310
Yeah.

2735
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:22,510
Oh, the way your face matters.

2736
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:25,390
You guys, the way your face matters.

2737
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:26,550
Oh, that...

2738
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:28,850
That makes all the difference.

2739
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:30,070
I've gone responsibility.

2740
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:35,370
If my box can't be where it belongs, nobody's box can be where it belongs.

2741
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:37,070
You can write.

2742
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:37,690
You can write.

2743
01:29:38,230 --> 01:29:40,090
This is where my box is.

2744
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:40,410
Okay.

2745
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:41,930
This is where I am.

2746
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:44,250
She was yelling in chat, where the fuck am I?

2747
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,590
Oh, it's so over.

2748
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:46,410
It's okay.

2749
01:29:46,430 --> 01:29:47,090
I'll move yours.

2750
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:47,670
I'll move yours.

2751
01:29:47,690 --> 01:29:48,090
It's okay.

2752
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:48,790
I need my box.

2753
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:51,350
Guys, don't worry, Yellow.

2754
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:53,130
I'm gonna do us a solid, okay?

2755
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:58,310
Now, Yellow, you just have to come back here and stand behind the yellow...

2756
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:00,270
Don't fucking me!

2757
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,710
Wasn't yellow supposed to be...

2758
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:08,390
Rin, I don't think your

2759
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,560
box is supposed to be...

2760
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:15,680
Oh!

2761
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:19,520
Alright, this might be okay.

2762
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:20,420
This might be good.

2763
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:21,620
This might be it.

2764
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:22,240
This might be it.

2765
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:23,020
There's no way.

2766
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:23,640
There's no way.

2767
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:26,400
No, the box is out of position.

2768
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:27,560
No, this might be okay.

2769
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:28,200
This might be okay.

2770
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:28,700
This might be okay.

2771
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:29,000
Trust.

2772
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:29,060
Trust.

2773
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:29,200
Trust.

2774
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:29,280
Trust.

2775
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:30,740
Did we click it?

2776
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:39,820
I just wanna be happy.

2777
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,280
I'm up here.

2778
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:46,380
I'm up here.

2779
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,300
My box needs to be down.

2780
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:50,740
Okay.

2781
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:54,000
I'll just go...

2782
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,120
I'm here.

2783
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:56,640
Nobody can move.

2784
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:00,980
Box stay here.

2785
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:01,540
Box stay there.

2786
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:01,940
Hi, Mint.

2787
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:02,800
Hi.

2788
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:03,780
Thanks.

2789
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,860
Thanks, slime.

2790
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:05,860
You want it?

2791
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:06,740
Let me push it over.

2792
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:07,280
There you go.

2793
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:07,760
There's your box.

2794
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:07,800
Oh, wow.

2795
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:08,500
Thank you.

2796
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:09,920
You're welcome.

2797
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:12,780
This has been the most teamwork I've ever seen.

2798
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:13,120
Hold on!

2799
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:13,860
Hold on!

2800
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:14,460
I'm not ready!

2801
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:16,060
Rin, help me out here.

2802
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:17,860
What are we supposed to do?

2803
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:20,020
What do we do here, bro?

2804
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:20,580
Wait.

2805
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,160
Is it here?

2806
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:21,720
Is this right?

2807
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:22,320
I don't know.

2808
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,520
I don't know.

2809
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,440
Where are you taking it?

2810
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,600
I just put it there because I...

2811
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,000
No!

2812
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,680
Doki, you fucked my box!

2813
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:29,840
That wasn't the right spot!

2814
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:30,760
Doki!

2815
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,260
I trusted you, Juniper!

2816
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:33,400
Doki!

2817
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,360
I didn't know what I was supposed to do.

2818
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:36,600
I thought you were doing something.

2819
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,360
I was like, what?

2820
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:38,420
Doki!

2821
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:39,960
That's not my cool box!

2822
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:40,580
I don't know!

2823
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,120
Doki!

2824
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,320
I think it was still

2825
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,140
gone.

2826
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,100
Oh, dear lord.

2827
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,400
I thought you needed it.

2828
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,540
You're freaking out!

2829
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:54,800
Don't leave!

2830
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:55,840
It's a box!

2831
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:56,540
It's a box!

2832
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:58,020
Everybody is moving my box!

2833
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:00,120
Okay.

2834
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:00,840
Okay.

2835
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:01,440
We're...

2836
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,880
Click on your box!

2837
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:03,700
Oh, wait!

2838
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:04,420
Oh, no.

2839
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:06,200
I wasn't paying attention.

2840
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,040
I got you.

2841
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:09,120
Your box is like here.

2842
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:09,240
It's over.

2843
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:10,720
It's over.

2844
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,720
It's over.

2845
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:13,000
It's over.

2846
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:13,580
It's over.

2847
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:13,860
It's over.

2848
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:13,900
It's over.

2849
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:14,640
I think that's why...

2850
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:16,540
Can you just walk to me?

2851
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:17,620
Can you just walk to the right, Doki?

2852
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:18,560
Oh, sorry.

2853
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:19,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2854
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,120
I can't move.

2855
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:21,540
There we go.

2856
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:22,040
Okay.

2857
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,120
Okay, I'm done.

2858
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,860
I can't move right now.

2859
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:27,700
What are you doing?

2860
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:28,620
I'm on my own!

2861
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:29,620
Help me!

2862
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:31,060
Help!

2863
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:32,820
Help me!

2864
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:33,220
I need my...

2865
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,120
It's a box!

2866
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,620
Maybe you have the people with boxes who are your boss.

2867
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:43,400
How about that?

2868
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,240
You vacuumed me right at the end.

2869
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,840
You put me out the way.

2870
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:50,400
You put me out the way!

2871
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,280
It's okay.

2872
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,620
People with boxes, do your part!

2873
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:56,920
Okay, no.

2874
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,260
Okay, everybody with a box, move on.

2875
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:02,020
Box gotta go down here.

2876
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:08,580
And if you don't have a box, don't touch the other people's boxes.

2877
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:10,620
Yeah, Doki!

2878
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:11,820
Take your own advice!

2879
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,200
Yeah, that's what I'm learning now!

2880
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,440
Okay, we're good.

2881
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:20,120
No, I need green!

2882
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,040
I need green!

2883
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:21,700
Push it down!

2884
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:23,060
Don't push it down!

2885
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:23,700
There you go!

2886
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,640
Don't push it down!

2887
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:28,920
Does anybody remember what pink was supposed to do?

2888
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:31,960
Oh no!

2889
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:34,720
Probably!

2890
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,680
I look like I'm blinding you.

2891
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,120
I'm totally face-locked.

2892
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:38,940
Don't push!

2893
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,320
Don't push!

2894
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,160
Don't push!

2895
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:42,180
Don't push!

2896
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:43,560
Don't push!

2897
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:43,580
Don't push!

2898
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:43,660
Don't push!

2899
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:43,740
Don't push!

2900
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:45,400
Huh?

2901
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:50,300
It had to go in the corner!

2902
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,320
What do you mean it wasn't there?

2903
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,680
It was locked the fucking door!

2904
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,600
I'm blinding you now.

2905
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:58,620
I'm blind!

2906
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,640
I almost got it!

2907
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,600
You almost had it!

2908
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:05,160
You almost did!

2909
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:05,320
I almost got it!

2910
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:05,680
I almost did!

2911
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:08,100
Okay, I'm locked in.

2912
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:08,840
I'm locked in.

2913
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:09,480
I'm locked in.

2914
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:10,200
I'm locked in.

2915
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:10,700
I'm locked in.

2916
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:12,360
Okay, this is it.

2917
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:12,780
This is it.

2918
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:14,480
Alright, face into the right.

2919
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:15,220
Face into the right.

2920
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:16,720
Okay, I have a box.

2921
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:17,160
I'm six.

2922
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:17,580
I'm six.

2923
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:18,400
Please let me go first.

2924
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,080
I'm going to the left.

2925
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:19,620
Okay, okay.

2926
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:21,780
Stay here until 10 seconds left.

2927
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:22,960
Please be kind.

2928
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:23,960
I'm going to the left.

2929
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,060
Guys, I feel like some people without boxes went up, guys.

2930
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:31,380
Oh, my bad.

2931
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:32,840
You're all for me!

2932
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:34,080
Excuse me.

2933
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:34,800
Excuse me.

2934
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:35,200
Pardon me.

2935
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:35,440
Thank you.

2936
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:36,400
I'm perfect.

2937
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,040
I'm perfect.

2938
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:39,100
Everything about my position and my box is perfect.

2939
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:40,020
Do not touch it, please.

2940
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:40,400
Thank you.

2941
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:41,580
This is awkward.

2942
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:43,180
How do I do this?

2943
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:43,560
Here we go.

2944
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:44,640
I'm here.

2945
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:45,180
Don't touch mine.

2946
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:45,480
We're here.

2947
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:47,300
Jade, how do I...

2948
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:48,100
It's over.

2949
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:49,280
It's over.

2950
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:50,320
It's so over.

2951
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:51,320
What happened?

2952
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:51,920
What do you need?

2953
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:52,100
What do you need?

2954
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:54,740
I just... I don't know where to put the box now.

2955
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:00,480
This is mine.

2956
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,960
What's got up there?

2957
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:04,780
I was so far away.

2958
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,720
The box was at the third level.

2959
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,100
I was supposed to be at the bottom.

2960
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:12,720
She only gravitated up 18% of the wall.

2961
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,460
I didn't even get up there.

2962
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,200
I couldn't even jump.

2963
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:21,570
Okay, okay.

2964
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:22,890
Okay, okay, okay.

2965
01:35:23,130 --> 01:35:23,770
I've got to go here.

2966
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:24,270
Oh, my God.

2967
01:35:24,330 --> 01:35:24,750
Not again.

2968
01:35:25,570 --> 01:35:26,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2969
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:26,250
Okay.

2970
01:35:27,010 --> 01:35:28,270
Let us do anything.

2971
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:30,470
Bao, if you need help, let me know.

2972
01:35:31,090 --> 01:35:31,450
Okay.

2973
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:33,810
I'm down here with your... well, not with your box.

2974
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:34,370
I could be...

2975
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:34,510
The box?

2976
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:35,150
Go first.

2977
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:36,390
I am a box?

2978
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:36,690
All right.

2979
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:38,350
Hi-yah.

2980
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:39,410
Okay.

2981
01:35:40,090 --> 01:35:40,770
Okay, I'm good.

2982
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:42,610
Okay.

2983
01:35:44,430 --> 01:35:45,210
Excuse me, Bao.

2984
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:47,630
Are you okay over there with the box, people?

2985
01:35:48,230 --> 01:35:48,590
There we go.

2986
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:49,270
The box is here.

2987
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:49,870
The box is here.

2988
01:35:49,890 --> 01:35:50,150
The box is here.

2989
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:51,330
The box is here.

2990
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:51,610
The box is here.

2991
01:35:51,610 --> 01:35:52,090
The box is here.

2992
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:52,450
The box is here.

2993
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:53,710
Yay.

2994
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:55,050
Yay.

2995
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:56,550
No, stop.

2996
01:35:56,830 --> 01:35:58,570
Please don't move my box.

2997
01:35:58,790 --> 01:35:59,730
I need the box.

2998
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:00,770
What is it?

2999
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:02,110
What is it?

3000
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:03,550
Let's do it again.

3001
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:04,650
Yay.

3002
01:36:05,170 --> 01:36:05,730
Yay.

3003
01:36:09,970 --> 01:36:11,290
Hello, darkness.

3004
01:36:11,290 --> 01:36:12,690
My old friend.

3005
01:36:14,290 --> 01:36:15,030
Thank you.

3006
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:24,900
Oh, my God.

3007
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:26,840
Bao, you can't hold your box.

3008
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:27,180
Oh, gosh.

3009
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:28,060
I like this song.

3010
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:30,480
You can take the box and jump off to the bottom floor.

3011
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,420
When I jump, it doesn't go away.

3012
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:33,220
Oh, okay.

3013
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,900
My box is here.

3014
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,460
My box is almost in the same position.

3015
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:35,780
Okay?

3016
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,620
Just don't move my box.

3017
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,060
I'll move it myself.

3018
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,120
Wait.

3019
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:40,480
Where am I?

3020
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:40,700
Okay.

3021
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:41,120
I'm up there.

3022
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:41,480
Okay.

3023
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:42,220
All right.

3024
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:43,160
All right.

3025
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:43,800
It's fine.

3026
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,480
Bao doesn't have to move a box.

3027
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:46,840
It's on the third floor.

3028
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:50,020
On the third floor.

3029
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:51,340
Okay.

3030
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:52,880
That's all I got to do.

3031
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:54,780
Just make sure red gets out of the way.

3032
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:55,480
That's all right.

3033
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:55,760
That's it.

3034
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:56,540
That's it.

3035
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:57,260
Don't move.

3036
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:57,980
No, no, no.

3037
01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:58,780
Don't move it.

3038
01:36:58,840 --> 01:36:59,200
Don't move it.

3039
01:36:59,260 --> 01:36:59,920
Don't move it.

3040
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:00,760
Don't move it.

3041
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:01,440
Don't move it.

3042
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:01,860
Watch out.

3043
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:02,140
Watch out.

3044
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:04,300
It's coming from my head.

3045
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:04,740
Thank you.

3046
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:05,400
Okay.

3047
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:05,740
Leave it there.

3048
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:08,500
Okay.

3049
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:10,220
Are we...

3050
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:10,360
Wait.

3051
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:11,060
I need to be in between.

3052
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:11,620
Thank you.

3053
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:11,980
Thank you.

3054
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:12,180
No.

3055
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:12,940
There you go.

3056
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:13,500
There you go.

3057
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:15,420
Oh, my God.

3058
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:16,520
Holy shit.

3059
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:18,220
Oh, is this it?

3060
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,120
Oh, my God.

3061
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:21,640
Oh, my God.

3062
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:23,620
It's so close, but I don't think it's close enough, Rose.

3063
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:24,540
I don't think it's close enough.

3064
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:25,060
No, I think it is.

3065
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:25,480
I think it is.

3066
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:25,640
Trust.

3067
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:25,900
Trust.

3068
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:26,080
Trust.

3069
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:27,560
I don't think it is.

3070
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:27,960
Are you free?

3071
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:29,420
I'm going to throw up.

3072
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:30,600
I'm going to throw up.

3073
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:31,020
This is it.

3074
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:34,540
This is it.

3075
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:34,960
This is it.

3076
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:35,700
This is it.

3077
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:35,720
This is it.

3078
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:35,740
This is it.

3079
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:35,820
Yeah.

3080
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,080
We made it out.

3081
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:42,340
Yay.

3082
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:43,580
We made it.

3083
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:49,820
Let's go.

3084
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:50,540
Yay.

3085
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,600
I'm lying in your arms right now, dude.

3086
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:56,940
So funny.

3087
01:37:57,180 --> 01:37:58,760
You can't take him with you.

3088
01:37:59,240 --> 01:37:59,660
Wait.

3089
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:00,340
Hold on.

3090
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:00,880
Hold on.

3091
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,260
Wait.

3092
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:02,300
Okay.

3093
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:02,640
There we go.

3094
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:03,180
Okay.

3095
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:04,140
I was going to be like that.

3096
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:05,320
I'm so fucked.

3097
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,380
We can't get out.

3098
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:09,680
Woohoo.

3099
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:20,900
It hasn't even been two hours.

3100
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:25,840
It's almost two hours and we completed three worlds out of thirteen.

3101
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:27,520
That's good.

3102
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:29,720
I agree.

3103
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,820
We should open an academy.

3104
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:35,020
Okay.

3105
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:36,240
What is this?

3106
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:37,660
What the fuck is this?

3107
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:38,080
It's a marathon.

3108
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,340
You must make a tower.

3109
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,820
But don't touch the top.

3110
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:43,800
Don't touch the top.

3111
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:44,500
You'll die.

3112
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,260
That's definitely not a trick.

3113
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:49,120
That's a trick.

3114
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:49,800
There's a trick.

3115
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,240
You've been tricked.

3116
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:51,660
I'm sorry.

3117
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:55,140
Any skinny legends?

3118
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:56,940
Time to take the easy way out.

3119
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,240
How do we...?

3120
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,740
I think you have to do it with as few people as possible.

3121
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,520
So there's only one layer maybe.

3122
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,460
I think only four people could fit.

3123
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:07,460
Yes.

3124
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:09,300
How do you still pass the key?

3125
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,820
It was not...

3126
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:16,020
I mean, I assume hopefully that the blocks will come back up when the water is done.

3127
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:16,240
Yeah.

3128
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:17,860
I think like there's like one person.

3129
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:18,680
Like it goes...

3130
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:19,460
Yeah, it lies.

3131
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,160
It's just a population check.

3132
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,620
A population check?

3133
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:24,480
Yeah.

3134
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:25,240
Population key grabbers.

3135
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:26,080
We need one more over there.

3136
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:28,720
I will make the sacrifice.

3137
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:30,560
Go.

3138
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:31,000
You got this.

3139
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:31,380
Go four.

3140
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:32,500
Okay.

3141
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:33,200
Make a line.

3142
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,000
Make a line.

3143
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:34,420
Put line.

3144
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:34,840
Put line.

3145
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:35,560
Yeah, yeah.

3146
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:35,940
There we go.

3147
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:36,560
There we go.

3148
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:37,900
Okay.

3149
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,800
If this is wrong, then I guess you will die which sucks.

3150
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:42,220
There's no way.

3151
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:42,580
Shoot.

3152
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:43,620
There's no way.

3153
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:44,340
There's no way.

3154
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:45,280
I'll miss you.

3155
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:45,680
There's no way.

3156
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:45,960
I'll miss you.

3157
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:46,180
I'll miss you.

3158
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:46,560
I'll miss you.

3159
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:47,160
I'll miss you.

3160
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:49,160
I know.

3161
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:49,680
I know.

3162
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:50,000
I know.

3163
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:50,080
What the hell?

3164
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:52,480
Because it can't kill you so you like stand in between.

3165
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:54,300
Will you stand in between the thing?

3166
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:54,860
I go down?

3167
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:56,500
Oh, stand in between with the doors.

3168
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:57,220
The doors.

3169
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:57,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3170
01:39:58,020 --> 01:39:58,800
When they come down.

3171
01:39:59,060 --> 01:39:59,620
I go down.

3172
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:00,240
Yeah, yeah.

3173
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:01,420
So we need like...

3174
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:03,060
Everybody then.

3175
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:03,940
So we need standers.

3176
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:05,100
Yeah.

3177
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:05,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3178
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,640
I was wondering why this level in an 8 player game was only made for 4 players.

3179
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:08,980
Okay.

3180
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:09,840
So we need one more.

3181
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:10,320
We need one more.

3182
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:11,480
We need one more.

3183
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:11,760
Yeah.

3184
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:12,500
To be up here.

3185
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:13,460
Yeah.

3186
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:14,520
We need another key grabber.

3187
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:14,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3188
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:15,500
I'll go.

3189
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:16,020
I'll go.

3190
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:16,140
I'll go.

3191
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:16,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3192
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:17,580
And then scoot down.

3193
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:18,120
Scoot down.

3194
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:18,520
And then you guys...

3195
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:18,920
There we go.

3196
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:19,180
Yeah, yeah.

3197
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:19,440
All right.

3198
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:20,100
Ready?

3199
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:20,660
I'll just...

3200
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:21,620
Yeah.

3201
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:23,280
There we go.

3202
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:23,520
There we go.

3203
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:24,320
All right.

3204
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:24,780
You ready?

3205
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:25,260
Position.

3206
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:25,360
Position.

3207
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:25,540
Position.

3208
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:26,060
Perfect.

3209
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:27,320
Okay.

3210
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:27,620
Okay.

3211
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:28,060
Now run.

3212
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:28,820
Go.

3213
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:29,180
Go.

3214
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:29,400
Go.

3215
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:29,540
Go.

3216
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:31,080
What the fuck do we do now?

3217
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:32,140
What?

3218
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:34,280
What?

3219
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:34,400
What?

3220
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:35,080
What?

3221
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:39,440
I can only talk.

3222
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:43,720
Okay.

3223
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:45,140
You're in this time, Emily.

3224
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:46,040
And I'm here.

3225
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:47,800
Team Geek annihilated.

3226
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:50,520
I live.

3227
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,740
Guys, have you subscribed?

3228
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:52,240
Not mine?

3229
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:54,480
Oh thanks for that.

3230
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:56,540
You live in this room.

3231
01:40:56,540 --> 01:40:57,280
Yeah, that's huge.

3232
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:57,800
You just messed up.

3233
01:40:58,500 --> 01:40:59,140
That's big.

3234
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:00,460
Okay.

3235
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:01,360
Everybody up.

3236
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,200
Everybody up.

3237
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:03,420
I'll be at the last door.

3238
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:04,480
I'll be at the last door.

3239
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:04,780
No.

3240
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:05,020
No.

3241
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:05,960
No, no, no.

3242
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:06,860
I'll do it.

3243
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:07,840
Toki, you know what?

3244
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:08,160
I...

3245
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:09,560
I can time this.

3246
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:10,960
No, it's okay.

3247
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:13,780
I'm sorry, but you'll be at the last door.

3248
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:14,820
I don't want the pressure.

3249
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:16,280
Oh, I closed up and fell.

3250
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:16,500
Sorry.

3251
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:17,680
Hi, Snappy.

3252
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:18,600
Hi.

3253
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:19,720
Okay, everybody.

3254
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:20,240
Hi.

3255
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:20,900
Meow, meow.

3256
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:23,000
Okay, we must...

3257
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:24,060
Alright.

3258
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:25,400
There we go, there we go.

3259
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:25,600
Okay.

3260
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:26,440
Okay.

3261
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:27,300
Alright.

3262
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:28,180
We, we, we, we...

3263
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:28,500
Okay, now.

3264
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:29,400
Squinch.

3265
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:31,480
Squinch, squinch, squinch.

3266
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,180
Go, go, go, go.

3267
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:34,000
Squinch, squinch, squinch.

3268
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:34,400
Squinch, squinch, squinch.

3269
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:34,420
Squinch, squinch, squinch.

3270
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:35,240
Go, go, go.

3271
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,240
Squinch, squinch, squinch.

3272
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:37,080
Squinch, squinch, squinch.

3273
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:37,420
Squinch, squinch, squinch.

3274
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:38,020
Oh, sorry, sorry.

3275
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:38,440
Orange, orange.

3276
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:39,380
Squinch, squinch, squinch.

3277
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,040
Yeah.

3278
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:42,820
Let's go.

3279
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,140
I forgot what color I was for a second.

3280
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:47,720
Can you please this color.

3281
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:58,620
We need a little bit of excitement.

3282
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:01,640
A little bit of suspense.

3283
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:03,820
Oh, not you again.

3284
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:03,980
Squinch, squinch, squinch.

3285
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:07,560
Why is he not attached to anything?

3286
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,220
Is this the first time they've shown up?

3287
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,440
That's probably gonna fall off.

3288
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:21,980
He turned into Sonic the Hedgehog!

3289
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:24,280
I think we can stack it.

3290
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:25,460
I think we should stack.

3291
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:27,160
How?

3292
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,820
One goes right and the other goes left?

3293
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:31,220
Maybe?

3294
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:32,780
He goes far.

3295
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:35,700
He starts moving around like a pinball.

3296
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:36,780
Yeah, it goes crazy.

3297
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,980
We can all stack it up.

3298
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:40,980
We can all stack it up.

3299
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:43,500
Wait, what's this over here?

3300
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:44,240
What's this right here?

3301
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:45,560
Pick the key.

3302
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:48,940
Oh, there's another one!

3303
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,800
Okay, so...

3304
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,040
They can't go past that, which is good.

3305
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:56,420
They go right first.

3306
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,520
So maybe like...

3307
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:00,040
Whoops!

3308
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:02,440
I see, I see!

3309
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:05,540
One person goes up and gets the key.

3310
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:07,180
Wait, actually, no.

3311
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:08,960
Because then it goes back to us.

3312
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,940
Can we see what the box does first?

3313
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,660
Yeah, yeah, let's see what the box does.

3314
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:14,900
Don't touch the key.

3315
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:16,080
Just run, yeah.

3316
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:18,140
We all push it, yeah.

3317
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:19,500
Okay, who?

3318
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,160
You traitor!

3319
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:24,360
Okay.

3320
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:28,600
Alright.

3321
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:29,680
We push the box.

3322
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:30,980
Nobody jump, guys.

3323
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:32,020
I know it's very tempting.

3324
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:41,360
Wait, wait, wait!

3325
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,560
No, that's not gonna help.

3326
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:45,260
Okay, okay.

3327
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:50,380
What if we push it this way?

3328
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:54,320
And then we push the sword away from the door.

3329
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:58,600
And this one is for the other one that comes down.

3330
01:43:59,120 --> 01:43:59,880
Oh, I see.

3331
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:01,580
This way.

3332
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:02,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3333
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:05,660
Push it closer to us.

3334
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:06,120
Here, hold on.

3335
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:07,420
Push it like...

3336
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:09,140
Yes.

3337
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:12,400
I don't know where the other saw spawns, right?

3338
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,900
Okay, one of you guys get it then.

3339
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:16,400
One of you guys get the key.

3340
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:17,020
No, no, no!

3341
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:19,640
We can push it towards the key.

3342
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:23,320
Oh, I see.

3343
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:24,140
It's to block it.

3344
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:25,800
Got it, got it, got it.

3345
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:26,880
It's to block the blades.

3346
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,540
Yeah, yeah.

3347
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,780
Don't jump, guys, don't jump.

3348
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:31,620
It's so tempting.

3349
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:33,300
Don't tell me what to do.

3350
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:35,860
We still have to get that one block, guys.

3351
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:38,540
There you go, there you go.

3352
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:39,460
Nice.

3353
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:42,540
Alright, I am gonna push to the left.

3354
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:44,540
Push everybody.

3355
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:46,920
Pass where the key is, I think, right?

3356
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:47,760
I don't know.

3357
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:49,060
Okay.

3358
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,300
Alright, yeah, pass where the key...

3359
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:52,680
I think pass the door.

3360
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,960
No, no, we want it here.

3361
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:56,060
Yeah, yeah.

3362
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:58,760
Grab the key, it'll bounce on the block and then we get it to safety.

3363
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:00,480
Now keep pushing it.

3364
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:01,160
No, keep pushing it.

3365
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:03,020
Keep pushing it and it can't go past the block, right?

3366
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:03,560
Yeah, yeah.

3367
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:06,080
We're so smart, guys.

3368
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:06,580
Let's go.

3369
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:07,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3370
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:07,800
Keep pushing.

3371
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:08,900
Okay.

3372
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,800
Now just keep the key.

3373
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:15,540
Yeah, yeah.

3374
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:18,140
Alright, pass the key.

3375
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:20,520
Oh, oh, oh.

3376
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:21,920
There, there.

3377
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:23,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3378
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:24,340
It's a team effort.

3379
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,120
Yay!

3380
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:30,760
We did it!

3381
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,140
We're victorious.

3382
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:33,700
Yippee!

3383
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:34,620
Oh, World 3?

3384
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:36,760
Alright, here we go.

3385
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,620
This is so easy.

3386
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:39,740
Oh, never mind.

3387
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:41,160
What?

3388
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:46,720
We gotta stack, we gotta stack.

3389
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:47,960
And not get hit.

3390
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:49,220
Okay, I got hit.

3391
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:52,040
I need to see where I spawn first.

3392
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:54,680
This is so fast.

3393
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:55,620
What the hell?

3394
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:58,460
If we don't move, does it start?

3395
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:00,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3396
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:01,820
Are you sure?

3397
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:04,240
No, I think if we just stand there.

3398
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:05,300
Don't move, don't move.

3399
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:07,240
Don't touch your keyboard.

3400
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:07,980
We'll see.

3401
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:10,080
Oh, okay, okay.

3402
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,040
Okay.

3403
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,220
Okay, we just gotta dodge all of them.

3404
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,420
Oh, oh my god.

3405
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:19,120
They keep falling.

3406
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:20,440
What the hell?

3407
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:20,840
Okay.

3408
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:23,520
That's how it falls.

3409
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:25,300
Oh, okay.

3410
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:26,860
I sacrificed someone.

3411
01:46:27,860 --> 01:46:29,440
This one is something.

3412
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:31,500
Yeah, this is messed up.

3413
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,660
Oh, yo, we killed it.

3414
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:34,640
We almost figured it out.

3415
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:37,520
We also killed three people.

3416
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:38,680
I need to jump through the key.

3417
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:41,260
Oh my god, timing sucks.

3418
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,400
Well, I mean, we can get the key afterwards.

3419
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:44,980
We can get the key afterwards by stacking.

3420
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:47,000
Yeah, yeah, I don't think we have to die.

3421
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,340
I know where I have to go.

3422
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:53,220
You guys gotta figure out where you have to land.

3423
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:54,520
That was the safest.

3424
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,140
I just have to move, like, a little.

3425
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:02,180
I just have to... oh, whoops.

3426
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:02,680
Ouch.

3427
01:47:04,220 --> 01:47:07,620
I just have to move a little bit.

3428
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:07,820
My big head.

3429
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:10,120
Oh, never mind.

3430
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:11,680
Don't be sure you know where to go.

3431
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,820
Kind of, maybe.

3432
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:16,040
Okay.

3433
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:17,920
Oh, yo, yo, yo.

3434
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:20,380
Okay, it was just me, so I didn't fuck it up.

3435
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:20,780
You were so close.

3436
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:22,440
Hmm.

3437
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:24,960
Now move over.

3438
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:30,300
I gotta, like, jump and then hang really far to the left, I guess?

3439
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:31,920
Or can I jump over it?

3440
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:35,180
I'm not even drawing these three seconds of music.

3441
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:37,520
Rin, do you want to be the one to be on the bottom?

3442
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:37,740
Rin, do you want to be the one to be on the bottom?

3443
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:38,440
Or do you want me to be?

3444
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:40,080
There you go, there you go.

3445
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:41,300
Okay, you got it.

3446
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:46,800
We can't fuck this up.

3447
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:47,500
Yes, we can.

3448
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:48,340
Yes, we can.

3449
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:49,600
We will.

3450
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:53,800
There we go, there we go, there we go.

3451
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:55,120
There we go.

3452
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,180
We can't fuck this up.

3453
01:47:57,180 --> 01:47:58,440
Just don't jump in the hole.

3454
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:00,300
I'm alive.

3455
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:02,100
I'm alive.

3456
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,120
Until you're in there.

3457
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:08,760
Okay.

3458
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:13,840
We actually did that surprisingly very quickly the next day.

3459
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:14,220
Yeah, yeah.

3460
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:17,420
Okay.

3461
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:19,860
Maybe I lost one, so let's pray.

3462
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:20,400
Okay, okay.

3463
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:21,300
Let's all just pray.

3464
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,520
Just because you said that?

3465
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:27,580
For me, it's what I am.

3466
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,720
I'm not meant to be used like this.

3467
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:31,900
We spawned it differently.

3468
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:32,480
Okay.

3469
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:35,420
One at a time.

3470
01:48:35,420 --> 01:48:37,300
This has to be one at a time here.

3471
01:48:37,580 --> 01:48:38,840
Very carefully, yes.

3472
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:41,360
Only one person can go through per line.

3473
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:43,460
Or not.

3474
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,160
I thought I could fall through.

3475
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:47,380
I thought I could fall through.

3476
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:50,540
Okay.

3477
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:51,020
Okay.

3478
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:53,800
The people at the B part can just run off.

3479
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:54,280
Yeah.

3480
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:56,560
You guys can just run.

3481
01:48:57,220 --> 01:48:58,080
Oh, fuck.

3482
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:03,160
I think you have to wait until we're off of it before you go forward.

3483
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:05,200
I think you have to wait until we're off of it before you go forward.

3484
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:07,420
I'm trapped in my confines.

3485
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:07,740
I'm trapped in my confines.

3486
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:10,420
I'll go get the key here.

3487
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:13,040
Okay, you guys can go off with the next one.

3488
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:13,600
Okay, you guys can go off with the next one.

3489
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:16,080
Alright, and then you wait.

3490
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:17,180
Oh, we go?

3491
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:19,120
And then now you go.

3492
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:19,960
Oh, sorry.

3493
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:22,160
It's a little bit delicate.

3494
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:23,640
Very delicate.

3495
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:25,220
Alright.

3496
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:28,580
Okay, I'll get the key, maybe.

3497
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:29,380
I don't know, actually.

3498
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:29,900
I'm scared.

3499
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:31,560
Okay,

3500
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,540
Bow, you gotta move forward, Bow.

3501
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:38,280
I don't wanna.

3502
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:40,420
It's okay.

3503
01:49:44,020 --> 01:49:47,660
Okay, we can do this.

3504
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:48,900
I trusted you.

3505
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:51,380
You nestled in my dent and I betrayed you, I'm sorry.

3506
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:52,520
Ah, fuck, bitch!

3507
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:00,060
So excited.

3508
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:01,300
Okay.

3509
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:03,660
Oh, sorry, sorry!

3510
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:09,340
I saw a Stuffy jumping and I also wanted to join!

3511
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:09,720
Bow!

3512
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:15,220
Before I locked the door.

3513
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:18,020
I saw a Stuffy jumping and I wanted to join.

3514
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:19,840
My turn!

3515
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:23,560
One person get the key, go unlock the door.

3516
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:24,760
Okay, here I'll go.

3517
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,960
I swear my brain is fucking slurry right now.

3518
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:29,580
I swear my brain is fucking slurry right now.

3519
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:30,620
Nobody else knows except for Doki.

3520
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:31,460
I trust Bow.

3521
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:38,340
I didn't even finish the sentence yet.

3522
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:40,020
I didn't even finish the sentence yet.

3523
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,100
Ta-da!

3524
01:50:41,580 --> 01:50:42,100
Okay.

3525
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:45,480
Oh, we're playing froggy now.

3526
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,140
Holy shit.

3527
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:49,120
Here we go.

3528
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:50,560
Here we go.

3529
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:51,320
Nobody else can.

3530
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:54,220
That was all me, baby.

3531
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:56,060
We can stack, guys.

3532
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:57,800
You don't have to do it by two, guys.

3533
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:59,540
You guys can stack over there.

3534
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:01,080
I'm just not gonna move.

3535
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:04,580
Oh, are you guys coming with Pinky?

3536
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:05,940
Oh my god.

3537
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:07,540
Whoa, whoa, okay.

3538
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:09,020
Okay, okay.

3539
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:11,060
I got the key!

3540
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:13,480
Wait, but, wait, but...

3541
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:17,880
No one's got the key.

3542
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:18,680
It's so small!

3543
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:20,480
Not anymore, man.

3544
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:21,900
Not anymore.

3545
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:24,440
It might be safer to just go through individually.

3546
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:25,600
Okay.

3547
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:28,340
That's too much risk.

3548
01:51:28,340 --> 01:51:30,260
I know, it's too much.

3549
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:33,180
That's like five times more risk.

3550
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:35,520
That's too much.

3551
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,480
We just need trusted people to be the bottoms.

3552
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,020
Yeah, designated bottoms.

3553
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:42,640
Designated bottoms.

3554
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:46,540
Designated bottoms who haven't died yet to the lines.

3555
01:51:48,020 --> 01:51:49,420
I've never died.

3556
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:50,400
Pretty much everybody, I think.

3557
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:51,460
Okay, all right.

3558
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:55,240
You can't be a top.

3559
01:51:57,820 --> 01:51:58,940
All right.

3560
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,740
I nominate Lime to be one of the designated bottoms.

3561
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:03,340
I nominate Lime to be one of the designated bottoms.

3562
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:03,680
Oh, sorry.

3563
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:08,060
That was me acting out because I wasn't a bottom.

3564
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:10,080
It's so funny that Dot cannot be a bottom anymore.

3565
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:13,460
It's so funny that Dot cannot be a bottom anymore.

3566
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:14,280
What the heck, man?

3567
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:15,400
Let's stack, girls.

3568
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:17,300
All right, stack time.

3569
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:20,460
Snuffy, I think we can fit one more.

3570
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:21,000
Oh.

3571
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:21,620
Oh.

3572
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:25,760
All right, here we go.

3573
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:27,540
We can remake the bottom.

3574
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:28,560
We can remake it.

3575
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:30,640
I don't know if...

3576
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:32,660
Let's just go with that.

3577
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:32,980
Let's see.

3578
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:36,840
Are we feeling okay?

3579
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:39,600
How are we doing up there, Val?

3580
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:43,100
I haven't moved for so long, I forgot what...

3581
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:44,020
Oh, sorry.

3582
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:52,020
How are we going to get through the lasers at the end, bro?

3583
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:53,460
I can't introduce...

3584
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:54,160
You know what?

3585
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:55,400
I'm going to stop.

3586
01:52:56,340 --> 01:52:57,120
I apologize.

3587
01:52:58,620 --> 01:52:59,360
Do you?

3588
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:00,200
Do you mean that?

3589
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:02,320
Are you okay?

3590
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:03,580
I'll be waiting for four more.

3591
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:06,420
I apologize to every single one of you on my death by next time.

3592
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:08,320
What the?

3593
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:10,300
Everybody gets one.

3594
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:11,100
That was my one.

3595
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:12,300
Shut up!

3596
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:13,320
Shut up!

3597
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:16,100
That was my first time!

3598
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:17,740
Congrats.

3599
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:20,880
I don't want to get the key anymore.

3600
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:21,740
Someone else can.

3601
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:24,220
I got this.

3602
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:29,220
I feel like our power is leaning a little bit too far to the right.

3603
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:30,420
All right.

3604
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:32,840
Yeah, this is better, this is better.

3605
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,480
All right, you guys can go.

3606
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:36,260
They don't even look like cabin lockdowns.

3607
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:36,660
Oh, no.

3608
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:38,280
All right.

3609
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:40,140
See you, Doki.

3610
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:41,700
All right.

3611
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,240
Okay, okay, okay.

3612
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:44,440
Okay.

3613
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:49,300
Guys,

3614
01:53:57,590 --> 01:53:58,990
guys, I've had a revelation.

3615
01:53:59,290 --> 01:54:00,010
Here, get on me.

3616
01:54:00,530 --> 01:54:06,250
The taller the towers are, the easier it is to align them with the green cubes.

3617
01:54:06,630 --> 01:54:07,470
Yes, exactly.

3618
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:09,530
There we go.

3619
01:54:10,230 --> 01:54:10,710
Okay.

3620
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:11,790
There we go.

3621
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:15,170
Wait, Bao, can you inch over so that you're...

3622
01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:15,910
Okay.

3623
01:54:17,310 --> 01:54:18,030
Yeah, yeah.

3624
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:21,470
Why doesn't the key...

3625
01:54:21,470 --> 01:54:23,370
If it touches it, it doesn't matter.

3626
01:54:23,490 --> 01:54:24,490
I don't trust any of you.

3627
01:54:24,890 --> 01:54:26,710
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

3628
01:54:26,870 --> 01:54:29,930
Oh, my God.

3629
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:31,970
It was such a small margin.

3630
01:54:32,290 --> 01:54:32,710
I know.

3631
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:34,750
We have to be perfectly lined up.

3632
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:35,330
That's what I was...

3633
01:54:35,330 --> 01:54:37,590
Be so perfect.

3634
01:54:37,690 --> 01:54:39,830
Make sure that your bottom and my bottom are lined.

3635
01:54:40,970 --> 01:54:42,310
All right, here we go.

3636
01:54:42,410 --> 01:54:44,130
You can line them up with the feet in the air.

3637
01:54:44,190 --> 01:54:44,870
That's not what I meant.

3638
01:54:44,950 --> 01:54:48,830
You guys go forward first just in case we do all that and then we die.

3639
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:50,650
I don't appreciate how that tower is leaning.

3640
01:54:50,910 --> 01:54:51,350
Okay.

3641
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:52,330
I'm trying.

3642
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:56,910
Well, sometimes you're going to live in such situations.

3643
01:54:56,910 --> 01:54:58,930
I realized it as I said it.

3644
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:01,710
All right, here we go.

3645
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:03,330
Oh, God, oh, God.

3646
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:05,590
Orange, orange, get them together.

3647
01:55:05,670 --> 01:55:06,310
I'm trying.

3648
01:55:06,590 --> 01:55:07,450
I'm trying.

3649
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:10,010
I want to join in.

3650
01:55:10,330 --> 01:55:11,590
Oh, Lord.

3651
01:55:13,370 --> 01:55:14,410
Green and red.

3652
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:15,970
I believe.

3653
01:55:18,430 --> 01:55:19,150
That's pretty.

3654
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:20,090
I believe.

3655
01:55:20,570 --> 01:55:22,510
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3656
01:55:22,750 --> 01:55:23,690
Jump on, Snuffy.

3657
01:55:24,410 --> 01:55:26,950
Oh, I don't think she's going to get on.

3658
01:55:27,810 --> 01:55:29,050
It's all on her right now.

3659
01:55:29,050 --> 01:55:30,930
How is Snuffy supposed to jump on?

3660
01:55:32,370 --> 01:55:33,310
Oh, my God.

3661
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:35,190
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

3662
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:37,990
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

3663
01:55:38,550 --> 01:55:39,690
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

3664
01:55:39,690 --> 01:55:39,890
I can't watch.

3665
01:55:40,890 --> 01:55:41,610
I'm watching.

3666
01:55:42,070 --> 01:55:45,390
If she dies, I'll remember her face.

3667
01:55:46,270 --> 01:55:46,990
The last...

3668
01:55:46,990 --> 01:55:47,490
Yeah!

3669
01:55:49,610 --> 01:55:50,470
Okay, do it.

3670
01:55:50,510 --> 01:55:52,790
Final challenge.

3671
01:55:52,810 --> 01:55:53,510
Get through the door.

3672
01:55:54,190 --> 01:55:55,650
I will be power bottom.

3673
01:55:56,350 --> 01:55:57,250
We're so good.

3674
01:55:58,610 --> 01:56:00,350
I'm so proud of all of you.

3675
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:03,590
We did it.

3676
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:04,270
We did it.

3677
01:56:04,270 --> 01:56:06,970
We did it.

3678
01:56:07,050 --> 01:56:09,030
Oh, my God.

3679
01:56:09,490 --> 01:56:10,330
We did it.

3680
01:56:10,370 --> 01:56:13,530
You guys, I was shrimping so hard over my keyboard.

3681
01:56:17,890 --> 01:56:19,750
Permanent spinal damage from this one.

3682
01:56:21,910 --> 01:56:23,710
Why is that one so ominous?

3683
01:56:23,710 --> 01:56:24,470
Like, what the heck?

3684
01:56:24,550 --> 01:56:25,930
Just do this.

3685
01:56:26,010 --> 01:56:28,410
This one should be our last one.

3686
01:56:28,410 --> 01:56:30,330
It says special park.

3687
01:56:30,490 --> 01:56:31,410
What makes it so special?

3688
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:33,130
Okay, just one level.

3689
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:36,270
I'm getting up from my seat and I'm leaving physically.

3690
01:56:36,610 --> 01:56:38,230
Okay, what makes it so special?

3691
01:56:38,930 --> 01:56:39,570
Oh, one.

3692
01:56:39,670 --> 01:56:41,050
It's Russian roulette.

3693
01:56:41,130 --> 01:56:41,770
Oh, my God.

3694
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:45,370
So, you get to pick.

3695
01:56:45,430 --> 01:56:46,530
Oh, my God, it's squid game.

3696
01:56:47,190 --> 01:56:49,610
Oh, this is actually messed up.

3697
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:50,770
It's so special.

3698
01:56:52,990 --> 01:56:53,850
Oh, this one's fun.

3699
01:56:54,130 --> 01:56:54,510
Okay.

3700
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:55,270
Oh, God.

3701
01:56:56,930 --> 01:56:58,370
The pressure.

3702
01:56:58,530 --> 01:57:00,030
The pressure, the pressure.

3703
01:57:00,370 --> 01:57:01,210
Oh, my God.

3704
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:02,950
Oh, I didn't...

3705
01:57:02,950 --> 01:57:04,310
One.

3706
01:57:12,570 --> 01:57:14,970
This is my luck.

3707
01:57:15,110 --> 01:57:16,110
What the hell?

3708
01:57:16,630 --> 01:57:18,670
Just do it again.

3709
01:57:19,490 --> 01:57:20,610
Just get it right.

3710
01:57:20,850 --> 01:57:21,570
Okay.

3711
01:57:24,510 --> 01:57:25,290
You just won.

3712
01:57:26,710 --> 01:57:28,190
This is evil.

3713
01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:29,610
This is an evil game.

3714
01:57:30,110 --> 01:57:31,410
Oh, hey, guys.

3715
01:57:31,570 --> 01:57:32,490
We're doing really well.

3716
01:57:32,990 --> 01:57:36,450
Now, this is what I call Pico Park 2.

3717
01:57:37,290 --> 01:57:38,270
Oh, no.

3718
01:57:38,910 --> 01:57:39,470
Please.

3719
01:57:41,210 --> 01:57:42,510
Oh, my God.

3720
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:43,950
No pressure.

3721
01:57:44,210 --> 01:57:44,530
Oh, my God.

3722
01:57:44,570 --> 01:57:44,910
No pressure.

3723
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:48,250
It's like a 50-50 chance.

3724
01:57:48,530 --> 01:57:50,130
You win these.

3725
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:51,790
There's like so many buttons.

3726
01:57:51,830 --> 01:57:52,410
It's okay.

3727
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:55,030
All right.

3728
01:57:55,170 --> 01:57:55,890
Yeah, yeah.

3729
01:57:55,950 --> 01:57:56,550
It's fine.

3730
01:57:57,130 --> 01:57:58,470
This one next to me.

3731
01:57:58,590 --> 01:57:59,010
Okay.

3732
01:57:59,370 --> 01:57:59,930
Just kidding.

3733
01:58:02,490 --> 01:58:03,330
We're okay.

3734
01:58:04,570 --> 01:58:06,030
It's like a three out of five chance.

3735
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:06,970
You got this.

3736
01:58:07,070 --> 01:58:07,770
It's that one.

3737
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:08,490
It's that one.

3738
01:58:08,770 --> 01:58:09,390
Okay, good.

3739
01:58:11,970 --> 01:58:12,810
Doki, please.

3740
01:58:13,610 --> 01:58:13,930
Doki.

3741
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:14,850
Doki.

3742
01:58:18,890 --> 01:58:19,910
I can't walk.

3743
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:21,130
I cannot walk.

3744
01:58:21,910 --> 01:58:22,590
Doki, please.

3745
01:58:24,510 --> 01:58:24,930
I can't walk.

3746
01:58:29,830 --> 01:58:30,710
I thought

3747
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:49,360
they were deactivated.

3748
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:53,200
Why do you think that the game would be nice to us?

3749
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:53,660
What do you want?

3750
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:54,540
Oh,

3751
01:58:59,790 --> 01:59:01,230
that means that everything matters.

3752
01:59:01,490 --> 01:59:02,630
No way.

3753
01:59:02,710 --> 01:59:05,710
I thought it wasn't going to be active anymore.

3754
01:59:05,810 --> 01:59:10,860
I thought it wasn't going to be active anymore.

3755
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:16,000
I saw the fucking buttons weren't pressed right before min 1 and I was like they wouldn't.

3756
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,140
They fucking didn't.

3757
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:18,400
Are you kidding me?

3758
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:21,960
That's totally crazy.

3759
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,060
I was like so happy.

3760
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:25,540
I was like half popping along.

3761
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:27,200
Just like living my life.

3762
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:28,680
You were so happy you started glowing.

3763
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:29,940
I was like, no.

3764
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:31,800
Doki!

3765
01:59:41,820 --> 01:59:43,820
There's no way min hits the first one.

3766
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:44,780
Yeah, there's no way.

3767
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:45,560
Right, right, right.

3768
01:59:45,740 --> 01:59:46,680
Is it this one?

3769
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:48,180
This one, this one, this one.

3770
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:50,680
Pick this one.

3771
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:51,300
This one's okay.

3772
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:52,020
That one's okay.

3773
01:59:53,180 --> 01:59:54,820
Alright, I'm going to pick this one.

3774
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:55,420
On your advice.

3775
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:56,060
Yeah.

3776
01:59:59,960 --> 02:00:02,760
One out of ten chance.

3777
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:09,020
That's why I don't go to the...

3778
02:00:09,020 --> 02:00:10,200
That's why I didn't trust you.

3779
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,340
This one's safe, I swear.

3780
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:14,620
I swear this one's safe.

3781
02:00:17,660 --> 02:00:19,040
Oh my god.

3782
02:00:19,980 --> 02:00:20,340
Oh my god.

3783
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:21,540
Oh my god.

3784
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:22,280
Good vibes on this one.

3785
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,640
Yeah, yeah.

3786
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:25,640
I'm not fucking around.

3787
02:00:25,820 --> 02:00:27,380
I'm just going for the one near to the door.

3788
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:30,000
If I can get down, please.

3789
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:35,280
Okay, I want to get the clue.

3790
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:36,260
I'm hearing this fucking song in my sleep.

3791
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:40,060
There we go.

3792
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:41,260
Are you having fun yet?

3793
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:41,420
Oh god.

3794
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:45,500
Oh, it's just... oh no.

3795
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:46,800
It's okay.

3796
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:47,980
Let's go gambling.

3797
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:49,760
Aw, dang it.

3798
02:00:50,260 --> 02:00:51,280
Aw, dang it.

3799
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:54,900
Oh no.

3800
02:00:55,180 --> 02:00:56,320
Why am I last?

3801
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:59,180
No pressure or anything.

3802
02:00:59,860 --> 02:01:00,300
No.

3803
02:01:01,540 --> 02:01:01,980
Alright.

3804
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:03,780
This one's all good.

3805
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:05,920
The one near is the door.

3806
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:08,560
Okay, yeah.

3807
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:09,460
I'll go for this one.

3808
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:10,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3809
02:01:10,580 --> 02:01:11,520
So we can all walk there.

3810
02:01:11,580 --> 02:01:12,480
So we all know it's safe.

3811
02:01:14,620 --> 02:01:15,100
Okay, okay, okay.

3812
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:15,600
Okay.

3813
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:20,780
I like how we all waited to see it.

3814
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:23,380
Yippee.

3815
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:24,560
Ow.

3816
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:25,580
Alright.

3817
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:27,040
Yay.

3818
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:33,800
We did it.

3819
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:34,780
We did it.

3820
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:35,880
No more.

3821
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:39,920
I'm so proud of us.

3822
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:44,120
Who said this game doesn't stop until we do all 13 levels?

3823
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:46,840
Who said this game doesn't stop until we do all 13 levels?

3824
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:48,660
A psycho.

3825
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:50,760
You're sick in the head.

3826
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:52,660
Some of us have families, okay?

3827
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:56,860
Imagine if we had to listen to that soundtrack for two more hours.

3828
02:01:57,180 --> 02:01:59,040
Imagine if we had to do that.

3829
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:00,840
Even more than two hours, I think.

3830
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:01,960
I can keep going.

3831
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:03,520
We might as well just finish the game.

3832
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:04,280
Yeah, I'm ready.

3833
02:02:04,420 --> 02:02:06,200
I can keep going too.

3834
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:06,840
Alright.

3835
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:09,840
Can we actually finish this game?

3836
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:10,540
Oh yeah.

3837
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:12,280
I think we can.

3838
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:14,360
I thought we were meant to be friends.

3839
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:18,960
Well, we're not quitters.

3840
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:23,220
90% of gamblers lose before they win big.

3841
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:24,720
Endurance scream.

3842
02:02:28,050 --> 02:02:31,200
Unfortunately for 10% of gamblers, it is their bedtime now, so...

3843
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:32,820
Good night, gamblers.

3844
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:34,200
Good night.

3845
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:37,360
I'm still here, dammit!

3846
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:38,780
Good night.

3847
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:40,340
Good night, old man.

3848
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:43,220
Good night.

3849
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,080
Kids these days, honestly.

3850
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:45,560
God.

3851
02:02:49,300 --> 02:02:49,860
Alright.

3852
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:53,320
Are we actually completing this game?

3853
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:54,760
I'm down.

3854
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:56,120
Wait, are we actually?

3855
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:57,220
Are we actually?

3856
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:01,060
We can do it another day, right?

3857
02:03:01,180 --> 02:03:03,360
You know, for the sake of our brains, right?

3858
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:08,540
If we're gonna do another day, you have to be there till the very end.

3859
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:09,660
Okay.

3860
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:10,660
You have to...

3861
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:15,200
Or John Pico will come to your house and...

3862
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:18,520
Oh my god, send this to five of your friends.

3863
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:21,660
Or John Pico will come through your window.

3864
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:24,960
We will schedule Pico Park 2 and we're going...

3865
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,340
Pico Park 2 2.

3866
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:30,860
And we have to do it until we finish.

3867
02:03:31,260 --> 02:03:34,260
We have to do our entire schedule just for this game.

3868
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,260
The entire day.

3869
02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:39,880
Entire day, just to finish this game.

3870
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:41,080
Yes, the drills.

3871
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:42,220
Okay.

3872
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:43,540
No food.

3873
02:03:44,220 --> 02:03:45,140
No food.

3874
02:03:47,740 --> 02:03:49,080
It's literally torture.

3875
02:03:50,100 --> 02:03:51,700
Until you beat the game.

3876
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:54,500
You get 15 minutes bathroom break.

3877
02:03:56,100 --> 02:03:58,500
You gotta hold it until we beat it.

3878
02:03:58,620 --> 02:04:00,800
We'll ship everyone a special...

3879
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:04,600
The only pee you can have is Pico Park.

3880
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:05,800
Park 2.

3881
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:06,180
Woo!

3882
02:04:06,740 --> 02:04:10,880
If you didn't get a gamer bottle, you're not committed.

3883
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:13,160
Everyone's shipped a special gamer chair.

3884
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:14,180
With holes.

3885
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:20,100
You get one meal and one plastic bottle.

3886
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:22,420
Sit the hell down.

3887
02:04:25,120 --> 02:04:27,280
This is worse than the Marines.

3888
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:35,060
Part 2 is going to be an endurance stream.

3889
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:37,020
We're all committed, right?

3890
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:37,680
Yeah.

3891
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,520
In a horrifying way, yes.

3892
02:04:41,060 --> 02:04:42,560
We're all in a blood pack.

3893
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:45,040
We cannot leave.

3894
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:47,920
I hope you guys have your rabies shot.

3895
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:52,760
I hope we can start a little earlier than 11pm, Michael.

3896
02:04:53,140 --> 02:04:59,080
If we end, if it takes us six hours, it'll take us six hours, but we'll all be here.

3897
02:04:59,540 --> 02:05:03,800
If we hate each other by the end of it, then that's just a sacrifice we gotta be willing to make.

3898
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:09,420
A flow of poison is slowly dripping into our veins, and we have to beat it before the time limit.

3899
02:05:11,620 --> 02:05:14,200
We're gonna make a saw event out of this.

3900
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:17,560
I mean, that's basically peek-a-part.

3901
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:22,840
Alright, GG's, everybody.

3902
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:26,300
GG for all of you guys for the game.

3903
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:28,600
Thank you for playing.

3904
02:05:29,120 --> 02:05:30,080
So fun.

3905
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:31,980
GG.

3906
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:32,200
GG.

3907
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:35,520
Bye-bye.

3908
02:05:35,780 --> 02:05:36,780
Bye-bye.

3909
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:38,280
Bye-bye.

3910
02:05:58,680 --> 02:05:59,560
GG's every- oh.

3911
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:00,940
People are still in the game.

3912
02:06:01,660 --> 02:06:02,700
What if I click on it?

3913
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:03,380
Oh, it doesn't do anything.

3914
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:07,140
Oh, they're slowly filing out.

3915
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:08,880
Leave game.

3916
02:06:15,540 --> 02:06:17,400
That was craziness!

3917
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:22,520
My brain hurts just a little bit, but that was so much fun!

3918
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:25,420
Oh, peek-a-part.

3919
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:27,760
I'm just gonna close out of that.

3920
02:06:28,580 --> 02:06:29,620
And save us all.

3921
02:06:30,860 --> 02:06:31,740
The, um...

3922
02:06:32,220 --> 02:06:32,660
The...

3923
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:34,680
The torture.

3924
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:38,060
Oh, I was really nervous, though.

3925
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:40,100
So many people I've never collabed with.

3926
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:43,860
I hope you guys had fun, even though it was probably kind of crazy.

3927
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:46,900
And everybody was bleh-bleh-bleh.

3928
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:50,200
I didn't even have a chance to ask you guys if the audio was okay.

3929
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:52,520
If the audio was bad, I'm so sorry.

3930
02:06:52,620 --> 02:06:57,400
I was like mid-trying to adjust everything all within time.

3931
02:06:57,500 --> 02:06:58,600
I was like oh god.

3932
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:05,340
That was good?

3933
02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:06,580
Okay, good.

3934
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:07,000
Yippee!

3935
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:10,640
My brain is fried.

3936
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:12,720
Can everyone come back?

3937
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:13,720
Y'all never did introductions.

3938
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:16,800
Well, I think they've all collabed before except me.

3939
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:17,700
So...

3940
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:19,780
Throw this guy away.

3941
02:07:19,940 --> 02:07:20,680
Get out of here.

3942
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,040
Get out of here, Pico Park.

3943
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:23,380
John Pico.

3944
02:07:25,580 --> 02:07:26,920
Parked right there on my head.

3945
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:28,960
I can do an introduction right now.

3946
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:29,980
Hello!

3947
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:30,860
Welcome back!

3948
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:35,320
My name is Mint Phantom.

3949
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:37,160
I'm a ghost made Vtuber.

3950
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:38,300
And...

3951
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:39,100
Um...

3952
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:41,220
Um...

3953
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:44,440
Don't let me push the last button!

3954
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:46,300
Thank you!

3955
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:46,960
Yeah!

3956
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:49,340
Did you have fun?

3957
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:49,760
I did!

3958
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:50,600
I had so much fun!

3959
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:52,340
I had a good time.

3960
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:53,460
I hope you guys did too.

3961
02:07:56,660 --> 02:07:58,620
Now I'm hearing the Pico music in your BGM.

3962
02:07:58,760 --> 02:07:59,500
Okay, let's change it.

3963
02:07:59,560 --> 02:07:59,960
Let's change it.

3964
02:08:07,190 --> 02:08:09,270
Everything I have reminds me of him.

3965
02:08:09,570 --> 02:08:10,490
John Pico!

3966
02:08:12,570 --> 02:08:14,110
I like the Metal Gear level.

3967
02:08:14,190 --> 02:08:15,110
That one was really good.

3968
02:08:15,450 --> 02:08:17,690
I liked the button one so much.

3969
02:08:17,690 --> 02:08:18,630
The Russian roulette one.

3970
02:08:20,830 --> 02:08:22,910
Introducing Mint Phantom as the new guy!

3971
02:08:24,210 --> 02:08:24,690
Introducing Mint Phantom as the new guy!

3972
02:08:25,510 --> 02:08:26,130
Introducing Mint Phantom as the new guy!

3973
02:08:26,190 --> 02:08:29,970
That was so much fun!

3974
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:31,210
Oh, Pico Park.

3975
02:08:31,570 --> 02:08:36,690
Now we're gonna have to do an endurance of the Pico Park.

3976
02:08:36,950 --> 02:08:37,450
You were cool?

3977
02:08:37,530 --> 02:08:38,130
Everything was fine?

3978
02:08:38,490 --> 02:08:38,970
Okay.

3979
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:40,070
I'm cool.

3980
02:08:40,130 --> 02:08:40,530
I'm fine.

3981
02:08:40,870 --> 02:08:41,590
I'm cool.

3982
02:08:42,130 --> 02:08:42,910
I'm cool.

3983
02:08:44,430 --> 02:08:45,070
I'm fine.

3984
02:08:45,170 --> 02:08:45,570
I'm cool.

3985
02:08:46,710 --> 02:08:47,750
I'm cool.

3986
02:08:49,070 --> 02:08:49,950
I'm cool.

3987
02:08:52,950 --> 02:08:53,950
It's good to...

3988
02:08:54,950 --> 02:09:01,230
We kind of met up right before the stream started too so I didn't get much time to talk to everybody.

3989
02:09:01,530 --> 02:09:03,830
But it was all just chaos.

3990
02:09:04,150 --> 02:09:04,970
And you know what?

3991
02:09:05,070 --> 02:09:06,850
That's basically trauma bonding.

3992
02:09:09,470 --> 02:09:10,870
So, how's your sanity?

3993
02:09:11,130 --> 02:09:12,750
Like I said, I could've kept going.

3994
02:09:12,750 --> 02:09:14,670
I'm here.

3995
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:17,870
I'm stable.

3996
02:09:18,990 --> 02:09:19,490
Surprisingly.

3997
02:09:21,530 --> 02:09:22,530
I'm stable.

3998
02:09:24,750 --> 02:09:25,810
But next time?

3999
02:09:26,210 --> 02:09:27,010
I don't know.

4000
02:09:28,210 --> 02:09:29,530
Who knows what will happen.

4001
02:09:30,590 --> 02:09:32,610
It's so cool to see you and Lime in the same stream.

4002
02:09:32,750 --> 02:09:33,130
Yeah!

4003
02:09:34,890 --> 02:09:36,130
Lime is so nice.

4004
02:09:36,510 --> 02:09:37,370
I really like her.

4005
02:09:37,450 --> 02:09:38,370
I wanna collab with her.

4006
02:09:39,990 --> 02:09:40,490
Nah.

4007
02:09:40,490 --> 02:09:41,610
I wanna do a collab.

4008
02:09:41,730 --> 02:09:44,550
Maybe like one-on-one or like a small group or something, you know?

4009
02:09:44,970 --> 02:09:45,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4010
02:09:46,070 --> 02:09:51,050
There was something Lime was just like Once you beat this game, you must talk to me.

4011
02:09:56,830 --> 02:09:57,830
What was it?

4012
02:09:57,850 --> 02:09:58,650
I can't remember.

4013
02:10:06,290 --> 02:10:07,090
Ghost Trick!

4014
02:10:07,530 --> 02:10:07,930
Yes!

4015
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:09,450
I think it was Ghost Trick.

4016
02:10:09,650 --> 02:10:10,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4017
02:10:12,630 --> 02:10:13,930
I think it was Ghost Trick.

4018
02:10:14,930 --> 02:10:15,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4019
02:10:15,610 --> 02:10:16,990
I hope you can collab with everyone again.

4020
02:10:17,110 --> 02:10:17,230
Yeah!

4021
02:10:19,330 --> 02:10:20,130
Ask her now.

4022
02:10:20,270 --> 02:10:21,150
What do you mean ask her now?

4023
02:10:23,650 --> 02:10:24,430
She's not here.

4024
02:10:25,670 --> 02:10:26,410
She's gone.

4025
02:10:27,030 --> 02:10:29,310
Lime has always just been in your head.

4026
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:42,760
But if you lost sanity with this, oh boy you're gonna be in for a treat with the collab that Doki and I are planning.

4027
02:10:46,540 --> 02:10:51,140
Once I'm back from Japan You're a suit.

4028
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:51,320
You're a suit.

4029
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:51,660
Yes, yes.

4030
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:55,720
Thank you for the donuts!

4031
02:10:57,360 --> 02:10:58,500
Thank you, thank you.

4032
02:10:58,700 --> 02:10:58,940
Thank you, thank you.

4033
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:02,240
Oh, there was some that I missed.

4034
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:02,700
I'm sorry.

4035
02:11:05,580 --> 02:11:06,300
Cowabunga roll.

4036
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:07,940
Cowabunga roll.

4037
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:10,000
Jin, thank you!

4038
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:13,420
Shantae.

4039
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:14,520
I love Shantae!

4040
02:11:15,820 --> 02:11:16,880
Thank you so much.

4041
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:17,820
Ray, thank you.

4042
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:19,440
Thank you for the good company on my birthday.

4043
02:11:19,740 --> 02:11:20,880
Happy birthday, Ray!

4044
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:24,500
Happy birthday to you.

4045
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:27,540
Happy birthday to you.

4046
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:30,560
Happy birthday dear Ray.

4047
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:33,440
Happy birthday to you.

4048
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:36,080
Happy birthday!

4049
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:38,420
Thank you guys for the gift and memberships.

4050
02:11:38,540 --> 02:11:39,220
Thank you so much.

4051
02:11:39,260 --> 02:11:40,140
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

4052
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:43,840
Thank you, angel.

4053
02:11:44,900 --> 02:11:45,600
Thank you guys.

4054
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:47,820
Lime plus minto equals mojito.

4055
02:11:51,900 --> 02:11:53,220
What's in a mojito?

4056
02:11:54,300 --> 02:11:55,400
Lime and mint?

4057
02:12:02,070 --> 02:12:02,610
Yes!

4058
02:12:05,470 --> 02:12:06,410
And rum.

4059
02:12:09,130 --> 02:12:10,470
What's a rum taste like?

4060
02:12:11,210 --> 02:12:12,290
Babycore, thanks for the gift!

4061
02:12:12,290 --> 02:12:12,550
I did it!

4062
02:12:15,470 --> 02:12:17,450
Should I try a mojito?

4063
02:12:17,910 --> 02:12:19,890
Should I try a mojito?

4064
02:12:19,970 --> 02:12:20,650
Firewater.

4065
02:12:21,010 --> 02:12:21,190
Firewater.

4066
02:12:21,510 --> 02:12:22,770
I thought it's...

4067
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:28,300
Spicy?

4068
02:12:32,100 --> 02:12:34,740
But is it fine with the lime and the mint?

4069
02:12:35,620 --> 02:12:36,300
But is it fine with the lime and the mint?

4070
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:40,860
There's also white rum.

4071
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:43,000
There's also white rum.

4072
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:43,920
Rum can be brown.

4073
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:52,540
The syrup takes the edge off.

4074
02:12:53,380 --> 02:12:58,480
Wait, that doesn't sound like just rum and lime and mint.

4075
02:12:59,580 --> 02:13:01,340
Now you're saying there's syrup too?

4076
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:08,880
The only thing I know about rum is Pirates of the Caribbean.

4077
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:10,680
And I don't know, it's always gone.

4078
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:11,380
Apparently.

4079
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:12,000
Allegedly.

4080
02:13:18,830 --> 02:13:19,870
Simple syrup.

4081
02:13:20,350 --> 02:13:21,250
Well, that's just rude.

4082
02:13:21,370 --> 02:13:22,950
Why can't it be intellectual syrup?

4083
02:13:23,970 --> 02:13:24,530
I don't know.

4084
02:13:25,290 --> 02:13:27,930
You can't just call the syrup simple.

4085
02:13:30,290 --> 02:13:31,450
Incredible comedic timing.

4086
02:13:31,950 --> 02:13:32,470
What?

4087
02:13:34,230 --> 02:13:35,210
Thanks for the fun collab!

4088
02:13:35,410 --> 02:13:36,470
So same time next week?

4089
02:13:37,770 --> 02:13:39,310
I don't know about that.

4090
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:44,230
Because it gets too fancy if it's intellectual.

4091
02:13:45,650 --> 02:13:46,850
People like it simple.

4092
02:13:48,110 --> 02:13:49,270
What's that saying?

4093
02:13:49,670 --> 02:13:50,190
Kiss.

4094
02:13:51,230 --> 02:13:52,530
Keep it simple, stupid.

4095
02:13:56,290 --> 02:13:58,290
But my name's not...

4096
02:13:59,110 --> 02:13:59,650
stupid.

4097
02:14:08,190 --> 02:14:09,270
Thank you!

4098
02:14:10,650 --> 02:14:11,390
What do you mean?

4099
02:14:11,430 --> 02:14:12,330
What does rum taste like?

4100
02:14:12,350 --> 02:14:13,350
As a bartender, I feel attacked.

4101
02:14:13,990 --> 02:14:15,130
I don't drink!

4102
02:14:21,850 --> 02:14:22,630
Kiss him.

4103
02:14:22,790 --> 02:14:23,170
No!

4104
02:14:25,450 --> 02:14:27,130
Keep it stupid simple.

4105
02:14:29,530 --> 02:14:32,070
How simple do you want water and sugar to be?

4106
02:14:32,510 --> 02:14:32,590
How simple do you want water and sugar to be?

4107
02:14:33,010 --> 02:14:34,330
Is that the syrup?

4108
02:14:34,690 --> 02:14:35,010
Is that the syrup?

4109
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:37,230
I guess that's pretty simple.

4110
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:54,280
Then is it kiss him keep it sexy mint?

4111
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:55,540
No!

4112
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:02,640
Sexy!

4113
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:06,120
You guys, keep it sexy.

4114
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:07,200
Where is the sex?

4115
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:13,740
I have no sex appeal.

4116
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:14,920
What are you talking about?

4117
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:20,980
Do you want a map?

4118
02:15:21,220 --> 02:15:22,740
What are you talking about?

4119
02:15:30,630 --> 02:15:32,470
You are literally making a document.

4120
02:15:33,710 --> 02:15:37,330
It's not my fault.

4121
02:15:37,990 --> 02:15:40,190
It's not my fault people draw me that way.

4122
02:15:40,550 --> 02:15:42,690
Oh my gosh, I'm basically Jessica Rabbit.

4123
02:15:46,690 --> 02:15:48,870
This tattoo for some reason has inspired me.

4124
02:15:49,510 --> 02:15:52,550
And I'll eventually get around to commissioning Brazilian mint.

4125
02:15:57,070 --> 02:15:58,870
Do whatever floats your boat.

4126
02:15:59,730 --> 02:16:02,410
I got a mint cake fan art.

4127
02:16:02,510 --> 02:16:03,590
That says otherwise.

4128
02:16:04,590 --> 02:16:06,790
We saw the forbidden ducky, don't lie.

4129
02:16:07,930 --> 02:16:09,150
It's Isekai!

4130
02:16:11,250 --> 02:16:12,390
It's Isekai.

4131
02:16:12,750 --> 02:16:14,130
It's a different world.

4132
02:16:14,230 --> 02:16:15,210
Mint from a different world.

4133
02:16:18,650 --> 02:16:19,830
Thank you, thank you.

4134
02:16:20,970 --> 02:16:22,610
Thanks, Tri-Princess!

4135
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:27,590
Jessica Ghost.

4136
02:16:28,430 --> 02:16:28,910
Yeah.

4137
02:16:30,510 --> 02:16:32,290
No, Jessica... Isn't...

4138
02:16:32,290 --> 02:16:34,510
So, Roger Rabbit is the last name.

4139
02:16:34,750 --> 02:16:36,290
Or, Rabbit's the last name.

4140
02:16:36,350 --> 02:16:37,130
So, Jessica Rabbit.

4141
02:16:37,270 --> 02:16:38,430
She's married to Roger Rabbit.

4142
02:16:38,510 --> 02:16:40,050
She took his last name, so she's Jessica Rabbit.

4143
02:16:40,130 --> 02:16:42,090
So, I would be Jessica Phantom.

4144
02:16:42,670 --> 02:16:45,430
Oh my god, that means Jessica Rabbit married me instead!

4145
02:16:46,870 --> 02:16:48,270
It all works out.

4146
02:16:48,550 --> 02:16:49,030
Hahaha.

4147
02:16:55,090 --> 02:16:58,270
The moles are the moi moi magic, Pinto.

4148
02:16:59,870 --> 02:17:01,350
Don't look at my moles.

4149
02:17:04,490 --> 02:17:05,650
Roger Phantom.

4150
02:17:08,610 --> 02:17:09,330
No.

4151
02:17:10,330 --> 02:17:12,130
That guy is not involved.

4152
02:17:14,550 --> 02:17:18,110
Are you playing patty cake with another rabbit's wife?

4153
02:17:19,870 --> 02:17:20,590
Bakersman?

4154
02:17:21,570 --> 02:17:22,810
Bake me a cake?

4155
02:17:22,810 --> 02:17:24,090
As fast as you can!

4156
02:17:24,490 --> 02:17:27,290
Just talk MGS to us to be sexy.

4157
02:17:28,510 --> 02:17:30,030
Okay, so...

4158
02:17:32,650 --> 02:17:39,930
Solid Snake and his brother, Liquid Snake, are at each other's throats.

4159
02:17:40,570 --> 02:17:45,590
And one thinks that they're inferior than the other.

4160
02:17:46,570 --> 02:17:47,590
Yeah, you like that?

4161
02:17:47,870 --> 02:17:52,150
And then there's not a gaseous snake, but there's a solidus.

4162
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:55,990
And that guy is the third other brother.

4163
02:17:57,230 --> 02:18:04,330
The brother that, I guess, they didn't know about and they had to insert into the story.

4164
02:18:07,830 --> 02:18:09,210
I'm all hot and bothered.

4165
02:18:10,330 --> 02:18:11,250
Plasma Snake!

4166
02:18:12,350 --> 02:18:13,470
They're brothers?

4167
02:18:13,630 --> 02:18:16,450
Oh my gosh, it's exactly like a romance novel.

4168
02:18:16,550 --> 02:18:17,470
There's always got to be brothers.

4169
02:18:18,510 --> 02:18:20,030
There's always got to be brothers.

4170
02:18:20,730 --> 02:18:21,290
Hahaha.

4171
02:18:21,730 --> 02:18:22,130
It's always got to be brothers.

4172
02:18:22,130 --> 02:18:23,970
Claire, thank you so much for five months!

4173
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:34,360
Oh, sorry, they were typing in the Discord.

4174
02:18:45,620 --> 02:18:47,700
We're Splendid Nova, thank you for the birthday gift!

4175
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:48,940
Thank you!

4176
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:52,180
Lambda Delta, thank you for five months!

4177
02:18:55,540 --> 02:18:56,600
It was very fun, Minto.

4178
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:57,580
Going to bed now, goodnight.

4179
02:18:57,660 --> 02:18:57,940
Goodnight!

4180
02:18:58,980 --> 02:19:00,540
I guess I'll head out to...

4181
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:02,440
I guess I'll go...

4182
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:08,860
I guess I'll go...

4183
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:12,740
Tomorrow I have a mid-day stream for me, so...

4184
02:19:13,340 --> 02:19:14,680
Probably better for me to...

4185
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:17,640
Get some sleep...

4186
02:19:17,640 --> 02:19:21,020
Get some stuff done and get some sleep...

4187
02:19:21,020 --> 02:19:22,760
Better be playing Minecraft...

4188
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:23,120
Oh my gosh.

4189
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:24,900
Better be playing Minecraft.

4190
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:28,360
I

4191
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:39,960
haven't played Minecraft in so long, I probably don't know how to play anymore.

4192
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:46,580
I probably don't know how to play anymore.

4193
02:19:49,900 --> 02:19:51,580
Speaking of sexy...

4194
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:59,440
Slash, in your sexy voice say that my phone is ringing and I should really pick up the phone.

4195
02:19:59,800 --> 02:20:01,120
You want me to say that?

4196
02:20:03,340 --> 02:20:04,700
Your phone is ringing!

4197
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:06,320
Oh my God!

4198
02:20:06,480 --> 02:20:07,880
You gotta pick up the phone!

4199
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:09,820
Or else...

4200
02:20:09,820 --> 02:20:12,160
The call's gonna hang up.

4201
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:14,040
Oh my God!

4202
02:20:14,340 --> 02:20:15,400
Pick up the phone!

4203
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:20,520
Your phone's ringing.

4204
02:20:24,230 --> 02:20:24,900
Too late!

4205
02:20:25,580 --> 02:20:26,680
Call ended.

4206
02:20:29,640 --> 02:20:31,620
Maybe I should have done it without the BGM.

4207
02:20:32,260 --> 02:20:33,480
Close enough.

4208
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,200
What do we say in the Frogbear voice?

4209
02:20:36,380 --> 02:20:36,400
Oh.

4210
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:49,480
Okay, here's a phone ringtone for all you sexy persons out there.

4211
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:51,380
Okay, um...

4212
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:58,640
Hey there, this is your buddy Frogbert.

4213
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:05,200
And if you're hearing my voice right now, you could probably guess what that means.

4214
02:21:05,340 --> 02:21:07,420
But I'll let you have three guesses.

4215
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:12,740
Yeah, we can play a game of like three questions.

4216
02:21:12,940 --> 02:21:18,620
I was gonna say ten questions, but then probably the call will end by then.

4217
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:19,460
So, you better be ready.

4218
02:21:19,480 --> 02:21:21,980
You might wanna like pick up your phone...

4219
02:21:21,980 --> 02:21:24,900
Oh wait, you have to guess why you're hearing my voice.

4220
02:21:25,140 --> 02:21:26,580
Hold on, I messed up.

4221
02:21:31,180 --> 02:21:32,720
I messed it

4222
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:44,340
up, you guys.

4223
02:21:50,190 --> 02:21:52,230
I missed the low voice you would do.

4224
02:21:53,450 --> 02:21:53,930
What?

4225
02:22:05,850 --> 02:22:08,230
If you don't like my voice, you don't have to listen to me.

4226
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:12,650
You don't have to watch.

4227
02:22:13,190 --> 02:22:13,810
You know?

4228
02:22:14,270 --> 02:22:14,990
I don't know.

4229
02:22:15,150 --> 02:22:16,530
If you don't like my voice...

4230
02:22:16,990 --> 02:22:17,570
It's okay.

4231
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:18,490
I get it.

4232
02:22:18,970 --> 02:22:19,790
I get it.

4233
02:22:19,890 --> 02:22:20,430
It's okay.

4234
02:22:24,030 --> 02:22:26,070
I'm hearing that ringtone out in the wild.

4235
02:22:26,870 --> 02:22:29,210
Does anyone ever actually have a ringtone on?

4236
02:22:29,610 --> 02:22:31,150
I never have had...

4237
02:22:31,150 --> 02:22:33,130
I don't know the last time I've had a ringtone on.

4238
02:22:33,870 --> 02:22:34,310
Because...

4239
02:22:34,890 --> 02:22:37,590
Like even a text alert or anything like that...

4240
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:38,930
I just...

4241
02:22:38,930 --> 02:22:41,930
Because of work, I just never had one on.

4242
02:22:43,570 --> 02:22:45,070
You never know who might call.

4243
02:22:50,970 --> 02:22:52,010
Always on vibrate.

4244
02:22:52,130 --> 02:22:52,490
Yeah, see?

4245
02:22:52,610 --> 02:22:53,770
Mine's always on vibrate too.

4246
02:22:54,030 --> 02:22:54,950
Not like 10 years...

4247
02:22:54,950 --> 02:22:55,130
Yeah!

4248
02:22:55,550 --> 02:22:56,610
Mine's always on vibrate.

4249
02:23:00,730 --> 02:23:03,430
I think it's because I usually have my phone on me.

4250
02:23:03,470 --> 02:23:05,610
So if someone calls, I don't have to hear it.

4251
02:23:06,130 --> 02:23:07,170
I can just...

4252
02:23:07,590 --> 02:23:08,510
I'll just see it.

4253
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:08,890
Like...

4254
02:23:08,890 --> 02:23:08,990
Oh!

4255
02:23:09,470 --> 02:23:10,450
I'm getting a call.

4256
02:23:11,610 --> 02:23:13,210
Of the MGS codec call.

4257
02:23:14,350 --> 02:23:16,750
I want that for like my text sound.

4258
02:23:21,670 --> 02:23:23,790
Hearing a phone ring makes me anxious.

4259
02:23:24,130 --> 02:23:25,050
I don't know.

4260
02:23:25,170 --> 02:23:25,610
Like yeah.

4261
02:23:28,170 --> 02:23:32,150
Even in public, I only hear like boomers with their...

4262
02:23:32,790 --> 02:23:34,070
It's always like that...

4263
02:23:34,070 --> 02:23:35,990
It's always like that iPhone ringtone.

4264
02:23:35,990 --> 02:23:37,010
That's just like a...

4265
02:23:37,010 --> 02:23:38,270
Sounds like a regular...

4266
02:23:38,270 --> 02:23:39,090
A regular...

4267
02:23:39,590 --> 02:23:40,150
Um...

4268
02:23:40,150 --> 02:23:41,610
Phone ringing.

4269
02:23:41,830 --> 02:23:42,870
My text alert is the MGS.

4270
02:23:43,070 --> 02:23:43,310
Woop!

4271
02:23:43,790 --> 02:23:45,290
And my ringer is the codec sound.

4272
02:23:45,630 --> 02:23:47,310
I never turn that shit off.

4273
02:23:47,550 --> 02:23:48,050
I...

4274
02:23:48,050 --> 02:23:48,510
You are...

4275
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:48,790
You...

4276
02:23:48,790 --> 02:23:49,150
What?

4277
02:23:49,630 --> 02:23:50,730
How can you...

4278
02:23:50,730 --> 02:23:53,070
How can you function hearing that alert sound?

4279
02:23:53,350 --> 02:23:54,610
And then like...

4280
02:23:54,610 --> 02:23:55,430
Not...

4281
02:23:55,430 --> 02:23:57,450
Having the most anxiety in your life.

4282
02:24:00,030 --> 02:24:00,590
How?

4283
02:24:01,330 --> 02:24:01,890
I don't know.

4284
02:24:03,070 --> 02:24:03,770
I don't know.

4285
02:24:03,850 --> 02:24:04,510
I don't know.

4286
02:24:04,890 --> 02:24:05,510
I don't know.

4287
02:24:12,710 --> 02:24:14,630
Why do they always speak on speakerphone?

4288
02:24:14,770 --> 02:24:15,590
I don't know.

4289
02:24:17,810 --> 02:24:19,030
I don't know.

4290
02:24:20,570 --> 02:24:21,390
Phone bad.

4291
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:21,950
Phone scary.

4292
02:24:22,310 --> 02:24:23,450
So true.

4293
02:24:23,790 --> 02:24:24,510
So true.

4294
02:24:25,610 --> 02:24:26,350
I don't know.

4295
02:24:26,370 --> 02:24:28,170
Maybe I should get a ringtone.

4296
02:24:28,330 --> 02:24:31,310
I don't really get any texts from people.

4297
02:24:31,450 --> 02:24:33,550
I usually only get texts from like...

4298
02:24:33,550 --> 02:24:35,470
The doctor's office.

4299
02:24:38,770 --> 02:24:39,670
Or something.

4300
02:24:39,670 --> 02:24:41,490
I don't really get texts.

4301
02:24:49,300 --> 02:24:49,820
Nah.

4302
02:24:50,660 --> 02:24:51,960
Maybe an idol song.

4303
02:24:52,980 --> 02:24:54,040
As my ringtone?

4304
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:00,320
Nah.

4305
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:01,760
I think I would want Metal Gear.

4306
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:05,980
I think I would want Metal Gear.

4307
02:25:09,780 --> 02:25:10,300
Yeah.

4308
02:25:10,520 --> 02:25:11,260
We'll text you.

4309
02:25:11,420 --> 02:25:11,880
You will?

4310
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:15,680
I wonder if it would work for like...

4311
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:17,560
For like...

4312
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:18,060
Oh gosh.

4313
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:19,760
If it was for...

4314
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:20,760
Twitter notifications.

4315
02:25:20,780 --> 02:25:22,260
I would be getting a bajillion.

4316
02:25:24,780 --> 02:25:26,160
I would be getting a bajillion.

4317
02:25:26,540 --> 02:25:28,380
If it also worked for that too.

4318
02:25:30,660 --> 02:25:31,980
You'll never miss a call or text.

4319
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:33,260
Well guys.

4320
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:34,240
Actually.

4321
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:36,100
I'm gonna go get...

4322
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:36,940
Some din...

4323
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:37,360
Din...

4324
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:37,820
Dinner.

4325
02:25:39,220 --> 02:25:42,900
I had the chocobo chirp as a notification sound for my last phone before.

4326
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:43,520
I had to upgrade.

4327
02:25:43,800 --> 02:25:44,620
For my current one.

4328
02:25:44,660 --> 02:25:45,400
I don't know what to use.

4329
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:47,060
Why don't you use the same one?

4330
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:47,820
If you liked it.

4331
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:50,560
Ghost offering.

4332
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:50,760
I don't know.

4333
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:58,040
I don't know why my last...

4334
02:25:58,040 --> 02:25:58,460
Don't know.

4335
02:25:58,880 --> 02:25:59,680
Didn't go through.

4336
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:00,700
But I tried to say that.

4337
02:26:00,740 --> 02:26:01,220
If you...

4338
02:26:01,220 --> 02:26:02,860
Were into video essays.

4339
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:04,440
Second one.

4340
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:05,160
Just made a new one.

4341
02:26:05,220 --> 02:26:05,940
I'm on MGS.

4342
02:26:06,660 --> 02:26:07,060
Oh.

4343
02:26:07,740 --> 02:26:08,140
Oh.

4344
02:26:08,440 --> 02:26:08,840
Thanks.

4345
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:10,900
I'd rather not.

4346
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:11,660
Thanks for the five gifted.

4347
02:26:12,380 --> 02:26:12,780
Yeah.

4348
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:14,140
I think I'm gonna go get some dinner.

4349
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:16,300
And...

4350
02:26:16,940 --> 02:26:18,180
I want Taco Bell.

4351
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:19,220
I want Taco Bell.

4352
02:26:19,220 --> 02:26:19,500
Taco Bell.

4353
02:26:20,340 --> 02:26:20,740
Taco Bell.

4354
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:22,180
But I was cleaning earlier.

4355
02:26:22,320 --> 02:26:23,940
And I lost track of time.

4356
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:24,860
And I was like.

4357
02:26:25,140 --> 02:26:26,820
Oh, I'm gonna go get Taco Bell.

4358
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:27,900
But then...

4359
02:26:27,900 --> 02:26:30,340
But then it was time for the coollwooow.

4360
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:36,860
I've been thinking about it this whole time.

4361
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:39,220
I was like I really just want Taco Bell.

4362
02:26:44,990 --> 02:26:47,130
For a second I though you'd rather not check out the video.

4363
02:26:47,450 --> 02:26:47,890
Nooo.

4364
02:26:50,730 --> 02:26:52,570
We had Taco Bell today because I ate a hamburger?

4365
02:26:52,590 --> 02:26:54,690
I'm at Taco Bell in like so long.

4366
02:26:55,050 --> 02:26:56,310
I think like two months.

4367
02:26:56,450 --> 02:26:59,210
So I'm like, okay time for my like...

4368
02:27:00,910 --> 02:27:01,910
Buy... what's the word?

4369
02:27:02,030 --> 02:27:03,290
Buy monthly Taco Bell.

4370
02:27:06,510 --> 02:27:07,850
What should I get though?

4371
02:27:08,550 --> 02:27:09,270
What should I get?

4372
02:27:10,650 --> 02:27:11,470
What should I get?

4373
02:27:13,510 --> 02:27:14,710
Do they have Taco Bell in Japan?

4374
02:27:14,870 --> 02:27:15,190
They do.

4375
02:27:15,850 --> 02:27:17,950
But why would I go get Taco Bell in Japan?

4376
02:27:19,630 --> 02:27:24,790
The only fast food place I'll go to in Japan is really just Wendy's.

4377
02:27:26,350 --> 02:27:28,050
Because I like their fries.

4378
02:27:28,290 --> 02:27:30,430
The first kitchen fries.

4379
02:27:31,950 --> 02:27:35,870
But if I can't help it, I don't go to like any of them.

4380
02:27:36,070 --> 02:27:42,370
Except like, well you know, like McDonald's or Burger King or KFC or those ones, you know.

4381
02:27:43,790 --> 02:27:45,170
Taco Bell in Japan is kind of sad?

4382
02:27:45,270 --> 02:27:45,910
No way, really?

4383
02:27:48,610 --> 02:27:50,290
Imagine if they have Culver's in Japan.

4384
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:54,630
I don't know the last time I had Culver's either.

4385
02:27:55,070 --> 02:27:56,250
Long, long time ago.

4386
02:27:57,990 --> 02:28:01,070
Quesalupa and Quesadilla Funs.

4387
02:28:01,610 --> 02:28:02,190
Thanks!

4388
02:28:06,750 --> 02:28:07,950
The wet box?

4389
02:28:08,190 --> 02:28:09,430
The carvings box?

4390
02:28:11,210 --> 02:28:14,550
With the Chalupa Supreme and the beefy... I love beefy five layer.

4391
02:28:14,910 --> 02:28:16,670
I love beefy five layer!

4392
02:28:18,770 --> 02:28:20,030
Now I want Taco Bell.

4393
02:28:20,270 --> 02:28:22,210
Let's all go get Taco Bell together, okay?

4394
02:28:25,690 --> 02:28:27,450
Okay, group wisp outing.

4395
02:28:27,450 --> 02:28:28,530
We're all gonna go get Taco Bell.

4396
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:29,230
Okay.

4397
02:28:33,010 --> 02:28:33,450
Okay.

4398
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:39,570
I don't have Taco Bell near me.

4399
02:28:39,870 --> 02:28:41,670
Actually, that's also part of the way...

4400
02:28:41,670 --> 02:28:42,270
uh

4401
02:28:45,410 --> 02:28:47,690
Part of why I didn't get a Porsche.

4402
02:28:47,910 --> 02:28:47,930
Part of why I didn't get a Porsche.

4403
02:28:47,930 --> 02:28:50,050
Street 2, because my Taco Bell is kind of far.

4404
02:28:51,950 --> 02:28:52,830
I have to go.

4405
02:28:57,250 --> 02:28:58,430
BP5 later, burrito fun.

4406
02:28:58,470 --> 02:28:58,930
It's my fave.

4407
02:28:58,930 --> 02:28:59,450
Two ashes!

4408
02:29:05,030 --> 02:29:06,510
Stop being so based.

4409
02:29:06,910 --> 02:29:07,710
Oh my god.

4410
02:29:10,450 --> 02:29:12,830
I love BP5 later.

4411
02:29:13,050 --> 02:29:14,190
I love the cheese in it.

4412
02:29:14,910 --> 02:29:15,870
It's so yummy.

4413
02:29:16,850 --> 02:29:17,730
Stop, I can't.

4414
02:29:17,830 --> 02:29:19,530
Okay, I need to stop thinking about Taco Bell.

4415
02:29:23,110 --> 02:29:24,810
I didn't realize it was Taco Tuesday.

4416
02:29:25,250 --> 02:29:25,730
Absolutely!

4417
02:29:27,770 --> 02:29:28,950
Oh, it really is Tuesday.

4418
02:29:30,270 --> 02:29:31,930
It's Tuesday and...

4419
02:29:31,930 --> 02:29:33,130
What am I doing?

4420
02:29:33,870 --> 02:29:34,350
Tomorrow's...

4421
02:29:35,070 --> 02:29:36,950
Tomorrow is Minecraft.

4422
02:29:38,750 --> 02:29:39,870
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4423
02:29:42,410 --> 02:29:44,210
Wait, why didn't I fill in my calendar?

4424
02:29:44,330 --> 02:29:46,430
I just put stream, stream, stream.

4425
02:29:47,990 --> 02:29:48,970
Stream, stream.

4426
02:29:50,930 --> 02:29:51,630
Oh, okay, okay.

4427
02:29:53,410 --> 02:29:54,390
It's Tuesday.

4428
02:29:59,270 --> 02:30:00,590
Instinct9, welcome to membership.

4429
02:30:00,670 --> 02:30:00,990
Thank you.

4430
02:30:07,580 --> 02:30:08,520
I'm so hungry.

4431
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:09,740
Okay, let's go eat.

4432
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:10,760
Okay.

4433
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:22,360
I'm tasty s'more.

4434
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:24,840
It's dinner time, isn't it?

4435
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:26,080
It's not time for dessert.

4436
02:31:37,420 --> 02:31:40,200
Why are you guys sending all these super chats?

4437
02:31:40,200 --> 02:31:41,060
What are you guys doing?

4438
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:43,660
Why, why, why, why, why, why?

4439
02:31:47,140 --> 02:31:48,140
I'm right here.

4440
02:31:50,580 --> 02:31:51,640
I'm right here.

4441
02:31:51,660 --> 02:31:52,820
Rules are meant to be broken.

4442
02:31:52,900 --> 02:31:53,620
So true.

4443
02:31:58,580 --> 02:31:59,320
Super chat time.

4444
02:31:59,660 --> 02:31:59,940
No!

4445
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:02,980
No!

4446
02:32:07,640 --> 02:32:08,520
I'm right here.

4447
02:32:14,120 --> 02:32:15,980
Aren't those supposed to be when I go pee?

4448
02:32:17,260 --> 02:32:18,840
It simulates the flush.

4449
02:32:19,580 --> 02:32:22,120
It encourages me to flush the toilet.

4450
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:25,300
Taco bell.

4451
02:32:25,460 --> 02:32:26,720
Oh, thanks for the new ringtone.

4452
02:32:26,820 --> 02:32:27,240
Thanks!

4453
02:32:27,440 --> 02:32:28,160
Oh, wait.

4454
02:32:28,220 --> 02:32:29,280
Some of these are kind of backed up.

4455
02:32:29,320 --> 02:32:29,460
Sorry.

4456
02:32:30,740 --> 02:32:31,680
Arigato, arigato.

4457
02:32:31,960 --> 02:32:32,660
Oh, there we go.

4458
02:32:32,740 --> 02:32:33,040
There we go.

4459
02:32:37,780 --> 02:32:39,440
And wash your hands.

4460
02:32:39,940 --> 02:32:42,060
I always wash my hands.

4461
02:32:42,140 --> 02:32:45,740
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a fiend.

4462
02:32:54,420 --> 02:32:56,620
I don't know why I don't know how to end the stream.

4463
02:32:56,700 --> 02:32:58,680
Maybe because it was collab.

4464
02:32:59,900 --> 02:33:02,300
I didn't get to talk to you guys much, so I want to talk.

4465
02:33:03,380 --> 02:33:04,960
But I'll talk to you guys a lot tomorrow.

4466
02:33:05,380 --> 02:33:05,720
Right?

4467
02:33:06,980 --> 02:33:07,680
I'll see you tomorrow?

4468
02:33:09,620 --> 02:33:10,000
Really?

4469
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:17,460
She loves us.

4470
02:33:17,480 --> 02:33:18,780
Don't get the wrong idea!

4471
02:33:18,780 --> 02:33:19,020
Yeah!

4472
02:33:22,040 --> 02:33:23,900
That's not even a little bit.

4473
02:33:45,250 --> 02:33:51,830
Look at how angry I am when you make false, when you, when you assume things incorrectly.

4474
02:33:53,670 --> 02:33:55,530
I just have a lot to say.

4475
02:33:56,230 --> 02:33:57,930
I have so many words.

4476
02:33:58,410 --> 02:34:02,610
And I didn't get, I didn't, I didn't have a chance to say all my words.

4477
02:34:03,270 --> 02:34:05,230
So I have to say them now.

4478
02:34:05,670 --> 02:34:07,590
I have to get all of them out.

4479
02:34:10,250 --> 02:34:11,970
It's not because it's you.

4480
02:34:13,590 --> 02:34:15,310
It's because I have too many words.

4481
02:34:22,510 --> 02:34:24,570
This is so disgusting.

4482
02:34:26,170 --> 02:34:27,130
I'm leaving.

4483
02:34:27,770 --> 02:34:28,510
Bye bye.

4484
02:34:32,250 --> 02:34:32,770
Itterashai.

4485
02:34:34,810 --> 02:34:35,570
Bye bye.

4486
02:34:39,190 --> 02:34:39,630
Otomito.

4487
02:34:41,310 --> 02:34:41,750
Bye.

4488
02:34:42,290 --> 02:34:42,950
Bye bye.

4489
02:34:43,810 --> 02:34:44,250
Otomito.
