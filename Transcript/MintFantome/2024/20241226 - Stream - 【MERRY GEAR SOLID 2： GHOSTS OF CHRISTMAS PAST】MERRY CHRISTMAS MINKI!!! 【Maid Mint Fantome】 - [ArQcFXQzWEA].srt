1
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,380
Welcome home, Master and Ma'am!

2
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,940
And Merry Christmas!

3
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,520
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

4
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,340
Hello!

5
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,660
Merry Christmas.

6
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,300
Minky Christmas.

7
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,900
Merry Minky.

8
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,280
Minky, Minky, Minky.

9
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,340
Mintle Christmas.

10
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,020
Merry Goody.

11
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,380
Hello!

12
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,940
Gosh, my voice.

13
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,540
I'm so sorry.

14
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,420
Hi!

15
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,800
I like how this intro is like a mix of...

16
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,900
4, like Metal Gear Solid 4 and then Metal Gear Solid 1.

17
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,540
Because it's like the Metal Gear Solid 1...

18
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,400
What's the word?

19
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,140
Title screen.

20
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,520
Minky Christmas!

21
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,340
Looking forward to cracking up to...

22
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,880
I'm really looking forward to cracking up.

23
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,980
It's been a while since I really cracked up.

24
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,900
I love that clip so much.

25
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,960
Commando Reindeer.

26
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
The way she reigns as my deer.

27
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,080
Merry Christmas.

28
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,640
Merry... What?

29
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,740
P-Box!

30
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,900
Thanks for 8 months!

31
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,640
And Prick!

32
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,540
Thanks for 8 months.

33
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,440
Thank you guys.

34
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,900
Big Mac!

35
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,940
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

36
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,060
Thank you.

37
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,140
I crack up every stream.

38
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,820
Guilemon, thank you for the... Thanks not only for the...

39
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,140
The keys, but also for the keys in chat.

40
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,880
I saw some lucky wisps get Ace Combat 7.

41
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,260
Lucky, lucky.

42
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,680
Merry Goody, Mintle.

43
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,380
Merry Goody!

44
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,800
I'm looking forward to cracking up.

45
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,640
Santa Paul, thank you so much for the pink.

46
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,240
Thank you for the 50 gifts.

47
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,460
Sorry, I didn't tell you...

48
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,060
Hi everybody at once.

49
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,760
Sorry, I didn't tell you what my wish was yesterday and all.

50
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,440
Thank you for the pink.

51
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,860
Merry Christmas, Mintle.

52
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,900
Merry Christmas, Nathan.

53
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Say Merry Christmas.

54
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,260
Merry Christmas.

55
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,480
144.8 hours later, Holocure is 100%.

56
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,640
What?

57
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,280
100%ed?

58
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,400
How many?

59
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:12,860
Hold on.

60
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,220
Wait, 100%ed in-game or...

61
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,860
Or Steam?

62
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,200
Wait, what am I at?

63
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,080
What?

64
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,840
Mickey, Mickey, Mickey.

65
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,160
Mickey, Mickey, Mickey.

66
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,700
Sorry, you can't hear it.

67
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,900
The music is so loud, but I can hear it a little bit.

68
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,080
Thanks, Ducky!

69
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,260
I'm thankful and proud of you.

70
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,720
Yikes.

71
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,240
I'm ready to hear your wish.

72
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,540
Happy Holidays, Mintle.

73
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,360
You are the father.

74
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:45,720
No!

75
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:47,920
No!

76
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,280
I'm not.

77
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,020
My wife, Bon, is unfortunately trapped away from home in a customer-facing job all night tonight.

78
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,760
Lend her some big fests of energy to help get through her shift.

79
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,740
A shift on Christmas?

80
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,360
That's so sad.

81
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:09,980
No!

82
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,200
And here is all my energy!

83
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,120
Blah!

84
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,340
Except unfortunately.

85
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,840
Guys, I don't have so much energy today.

86
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,060
I don't even have so much energy myself today.

87
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,700
I am so...

88
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,760
My tummy hurt real.

89
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,120
I'm a little bit out of it today.

90
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,220
But, that's okay.

91
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,220
Merry Christmas, Mintle.

92
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,360
Are you in Japan right now?

93
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,640
I'm not in Japan.

94
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,540
Not yet.

95
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,220
Not yet, not yet.

96
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,960
Yeah, I'm real tummy hurt hours today.

97
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,920
I took some medicine, but it didn't do anything.

98
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,390
So, I'm a little...

99
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,860
I'm like a little...

100
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,040
If I feel a little winded, a little low energy, that's it.

101
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,240
Today, I really didn't do much of anything.

102
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,300
I cleaned a little bit.

103
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,540
I watched a show that...

104
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,440
That a friend recommended called Severance.

105
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,540
Have you guys ever heard of it before?

106
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,260
It's pretty interesting.

107
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,540
I'm on episode...

108
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,680
6.

109
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,880
Good ass show.

110
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,640
My tummy also hurts.

111
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,300
It's the baby.

112
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,460
Shut up.

113
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,940
The show is intense.

114
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,480
I've not heard of it.

115
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,340
So, basically...

116
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,000
It's about...

117
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,700
Yeah, there's a season 2 coming out pretty soon.

118
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,520
Hold on, I'm turning down the music a little bit.

119
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,700
Basically, it's about...

120
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,580
Like a company.

121
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,800
And then, at the company...

122
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,700
They have like this level...

123
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,840
The basement floor is like...

124
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,600
The Severance people.

125
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,480
I'm sending this now, because I've got to do Christmas dinner.

126
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:06,800
Have fun.

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,720
Bye bye!

128
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,700
And it's like...

129
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,540
It's basically real life workplace.

130
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,720
No, it's...

131
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,520
It's like...

132
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,240
It's work-life balance to the extreme.

133
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,280
Sorry, I'm so like foggy brain today.

134
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,820
It's like work-life balance to the extreme.

135
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,220
So basically, they implant this chip in your head...

136
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,820
That when you go to the basement of the building...

137
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,000
You have like this separate...

138
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,680
Person.

139
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,180
That...

140
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,120
Is your work self.

141
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,820
You have your work self, and then when you leave...

142
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,680
You become your normal self.

143
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,580
And...

144
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,500
No way, seriously?

145
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,760
I've never heard that before.

146
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,660
No, no, it's like a...

147
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,420
It's like an actual thing.

148
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,040
Yeah, it is like a split personality thing.

149
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,140
It is like a split personality thing.

150
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,400
And the people in the workplace know nothing...

151
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,860
Basically, they call them innies and outies.

152
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,840
Like the belly button.

153
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,320
And like...

154
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,740
The innies, the workplace people are like...

155
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,040
Oh yeah, I don't know anything about my outie.

156
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,640
I don't know what they do.

157
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't know if I have a family.

158
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,520
I don't know anything, because...

159
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,760
Basically, they are supposed to be there to only focus on the job.

160
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,760
And then, once you leave, you can...

161
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,840
Just, you know, be like...

162
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,060
Oh, I don't have to think about anything from work.

163
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,400
I can just...

164
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,500
Enjoy my weekend or whatever.

165
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,240
The rest of my day.

166
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,300
So...

167
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,180
It is intriguing.

168
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,760
And then there is like all like the...

169
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,480
It's like the moral dilemma.

170
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,400
Like, oh my god, your workplace person...

171
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,400
When you leave...

172
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,420
Like...

173
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,040
They basically fall asleep.

174
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,640
And then, when you go back to work, they never get a break, you know?

175
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,800
So...

176
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,720
It's like, oh, it's kind of interesting.

177
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,940
The folks in work know nothing about their lives out of work.

178
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,440
And the folks outside of work have no idea what they are working on.

179
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,980
Exactly!

180
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,340
That's basically...

181
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,960
That's basically it.

182
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,500
Like, they don't know anything about...

183
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,220
Vice versa.

184
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,120
So...

185
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,760
Oh, Tom!

186
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,360
I also meant to say thank you for the...

187
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,980
For the model gift.

188
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,740
I saw it.

189
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,280
Thank you.

190
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,040
I meant to reply.

191
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:58,540
I forgot.

192
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,580
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,560
Arion!

194
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,680
Thank you for the hot kiss!

195
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,720
Thank you so much!

196
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,120
Merry Christmas!

197
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,020
You got it.

198
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,700
Yeah, I did!

199
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,580
Sorry, I've been super behind on emails.

200
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,360
So...

201
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,020
I've been super behind on a lot of stuff.

202
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,660
But over when I'm in Japan, I plan on catching up on stuff too.

203
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,240
One's a slave while the other gets to do regular stuff.

204
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,340
Yeah, kind of.

205
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,660
Just wrapped up with our festivities.

206
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,720
I'm ready to wind down here.

207
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,220
Merry Christmas, Mingto and Wis.

208
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,080
Merry Christmas!

209
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,320
Thank you, Arthur!

210
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,300
Yeah, thank you guys for being here.

211
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,040
If you're, you know...

212
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,660
Probably, like...

213
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,660
If you're with family or if you're...

214
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,100
If you're...

215
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,140
Or if you're...

216
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,140
What's the word?

217
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,400
You know, just doing Christmas stuff.

218
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,740
Thanks for hanging out still.

219
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,820
I appreciate it.

220
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,580
Like I said, I really didn't do anything except watch that show.

221
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,980
And kind of just...

222
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,600
I was just like...

223
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,160
I was dying.

224
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,360
Well, I'm already dead.

225
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,540
But, you know, tummy hurt on the couch.

226
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,000
I must have possessed someone that ate something bad.

227
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,920
Don't eat...

228
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,220
Don't eat bad things and have me possess you, okay?

229
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,480
My tummy hurt too.

230
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,310
My parents got my boyfriend and me socks that say...

231
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,440
His support, her carry.

232
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,940
And then asked what game it was from.

233
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,760
What?

234
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,800
What game is it from?

235
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,100
What did you say?

236
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,160
Must have been me, my bad.

237
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,120
No, no!

238
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,000
No, it was me, Mac and Cheese and Lactose Intolerance.

239
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,680
No!

240
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:55,800
No!

241
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,920
Mary Chrysler.

242
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,880
Mary Chrysler!

243
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,740
What was the game?

244
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,600
You could have said something like really...

245
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:14,900
Like...

246
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,060
You could have been like, oh, it's from...

247
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,920
I don't know why, this is the first thing that pops into my...

248
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,520
You could have been like, oh, it's from Do You Like Horny Bunnies?

249
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,020
Don't say Orc Massage.

250
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,100
Stop.

251
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,240
Merry Mintmas!

252
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,020
Why is that the first game on your mind?

253
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,660
I don't know, I was just trying to think of a silly...

254
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,420
Like a...

255
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,520
You know, like a game with a silly title.

256
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,080
Today was my first attempt at homemade pineapple pizza with red onions, ground beef and black olives.

257
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,060
You lost me at the olives.

258
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,500
I'm sorry, Ghost of Mint.

259
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,160
But yeah, anyway, today we're playing Merry Gear Solid.

260
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,360
I played the first one.

261
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,240
A bit ago.

262
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,160
Oh, I wanted to ask.

263
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,340
What did you guys get for...

264
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,280
From Santa?

265
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,300
Did you guys get any presents you liked?

266
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,820
Did you guys get anything?

267
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,040
Thanks for the five gifts!

268
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,240
Five gifts, so sorry.

269
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,540
Thank you for the superchat, I appreciate it.

270
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,980
A blanket?

271
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,520
Sounds nice.

272
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,140
A camera?

273
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,080
Oh, a camera.

274
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,260
Camera.

275
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,620
Pants?

276
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,360
Pants.

277
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,400
New monitor!

278
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,780
New pajamas.

279
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,440
I got MGS collection for Switch, let's go!

280
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,360
Depression, oh.

281
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,300
New iPad!

282
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,080
Switch 2?

283
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,400
Oh my gosh, your dad works at Nintendo?

284
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,020
AirPods Pro, let's go!

285
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,840
Merry Christmas!

286
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,180
Merry Christmas!

287
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,480
Mint-chan, you look good in red.

288
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,780
Thank you!

289
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,320
Even though it's mint green.

290
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,800
I'm glad it suits me.

291
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,740
A lemon juicer.

292
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Say you're an adult without saying you're an adult.

293
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,940
I got a lemon juicer and I'm excited about it!

294
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,640
I got a Cali pop-up parade figure.

295
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:44,860
Nice!

296
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,300
Abbott, thank you so much for the 10 gifts!

297
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,080
I unironically got a sweater.

298
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
What's wrong with that?

299
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,520
A cute watch.

300
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,300
Nice.

301
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,480
I'm glad you guys got lots of good stuff it seems.

302
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,120
Except the depression, maybe.

303
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,000
I hope you guys can return that to the store.

304
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,140
I hope they gave you a receipt with it.

305
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,920
Don't feel bad if you return it.

306
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,160
Mariano!

307
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,000
Thank you for the birthday gift!

308
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,300
Thank you so much!

309
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

310
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,740
Thank you.

311
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,420
Did I get something?

312
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,720
No?

313
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,700
Oh.

314
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,520
I have the gift of hanging out with you all.

315
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,140
The gift of us being together.

316
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,880
I found the pickle in the Christmas tree.

317
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,760
I was rewarded with a $40 gift card.

318
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,800
What am I taking you...

319
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:01,860
Wait!

320
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,300
Wait!

321
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,360
Outback?

322
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,800
That's the place with the blooming onion, isn't it?

323
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,480
I want to eat that!

324
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,480
I want to eat that!

325
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,880
Actually, I've been to Outback before, but only a long, long time ago.

326
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,140
But I went somewhat recently.

327
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,320
But it was in Japan of all places.

328
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,800
Last time I was in Japan...

329
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,020
Me and Pia and a couple of other people...

330
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,740
We went out to dinner and we went to Outback.

331
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,600
After the Tokyo game show.

332
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,980
And I tried the blooming onion for the first time.

333
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,440
Merry Christmas, Minto!

334
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:46,800
Thanks!

335
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,540
Next time!

336
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,040
Thank you for the pink!

337
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,760
You got the gift of hanging out with us and also $50.

338
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,740
Let's go!

339
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,340
I have splurged a little bit.

340
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,200
So I basically bought...

341
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:10,320
You know, I splurged on computer parts and I got myself a new keyboard.

342
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,960
I've splurged a little bit, probably.

343
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,680
A little too much, maybe.

344
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,100
I did get myself stuff.

345
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,780
It's all stuff that's coming later, though.

346
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,340
I won't have it until I get back.

347
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,960
And I bought some, like...

348
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,780
I bought a dress from one of my favorite Japanese brands.

349
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,180
Which I wanted for my trip, but it's not coming in time.

350
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,600
So I'm kind of sad.

351
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,340
But it's okay.

352
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,780
Do you have somewhere the delivery will be safe?

353
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

354
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:54,960
No, my maid cafe has a safe place to store stuff.

355
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,320
So it'll all be good.

356
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,380
Yeah.

357
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,980
Okay, so you didn't get nothing.

358
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,220
Well, I mean, it's me.

359
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,540
I bought the stuff myself.

360
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,130
I bought it.

361
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,510
I gotta replace my VR headset.

362
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,910
Oh no, did it break?

363
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,510
Merry Minkymas!

364
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,970
Merry Minkymas!

365
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,050
Is it a cute dress?

366
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,630
I think it's cute.

367
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,410
Can we see the dress?

368
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,490
No.

369
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,290
Then I can't wear it out.

370
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,010
It's kind of unique.

371
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,170
It's kind of a unique dress.

372
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,550
Sorry.

373
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,270
But I did get also a scarf with the dress.

374
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,470
And it's like a little scarf that is a...

375
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,450
It's a bunny, you know?

376
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,460
It's got like a...

377
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,230
When you wrap it around, it looks like a bunny.

378
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,330
So it's pretty cute, I think.

379
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,450
Is it from Uniqlo?

380
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,670
No!

381
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,570
Wait, does Uniqlo have stuff like that?

382
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,110
Sounds cute.

383
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:12,890
It is pretty cute.

384
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,470
Windows is removing Windows Mixed Reality Support, so it's going to break?

385
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:22,730
What?

386
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:27,190
Yeah, yeah, kind of like a Pekora's scarf.

387
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,250
Yeah, actually.

388
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,510
Online Japanese store?

389
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,710
Yeah, it is like a Pekora's scarf.

390
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,590
Yeah, wait.

391
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,770
Oh my gosh, wait.

392
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,850
Usada Pekora.

393
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:43,930
Yes!

394
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,190
Actually, it's so much like that.

395
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,010
That's so silly.

396
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,370
Wow, ice cream!

397
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,510
Merry Christmas, my Kamiyoshi!

398
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,490
Thank you for the hakusupa.

399
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,850
Thank you!

400
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,650
Thank you.

401
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,250
Santa Costa.

402
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,430
I thought of something crazy you could do since you're a ghost.

403
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,250
What if you possessed the bodies of...

404
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:20,910
Of death row inmates and made their last meal request for them.

405
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,230
That's so morbid.

406
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,870
It's Christmas.

407
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,970
It's Christmas.

408
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,490
What are you thinking about?

409
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:38,730
Merry... Merry Krimmy from Happy Holidays and New Years.

410
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,110
Thanks, Patch!

411
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,610
Alright guys, enough yappin'.

412
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,550
Enough yappin'.

413
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:50,590
I think this game is pretty much longer from the previous Merry Gear Solid we did.

414
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,790
This is actually a fan game.

415
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,290
So, you know.

416
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,750
Meant to quote a famous coffee commercial.

417
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,410
You are my present this year.

418
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,810
Agent, is that... I think I literally referenced that yesterday.

419
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,730
Or rather, I mentioned it yesterday.

420
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,150
Is that the... How do you say that coffee brand?

421
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,830
Is it Folgers or Folger?

422
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,030
Fol... Folgers in your cup.

423
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,750
Folgers cup.

424
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,630
Cough.

425
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,390
Folgers.

426
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,410
Folgers.

427
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,090
You guys know that one?

428
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,070
The creepy, like, brother and sister one?

429
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,710
Folgers.

430
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,230
Like a GIF.

431
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:28,990
Oh, okay, okay.

432
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,050
Folgers.

433
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:35,910
The what?

434
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,310
So it's like...

435
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,030
I know it very well.

436
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,530
What, do you watch it every year as like a tradition?

437
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,530
Gotta ask before I have to wait another year.

438
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,270
Can I get a Christmas Carol ghost quote?

439
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,590
Maybe... Come in and know me better, bro.

440
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,540
Huh?

441
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:02,800
What?

442
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,280
Huh?

443
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,500
What is a Christmas Carol ghost quote?

444
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,500
Someone had too much eggnog.

445
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,560
Okay, I'm channeling ghosts of Christmas future.

446
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,720
I'm the ghost of Christmas future.

447
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,440
And... get in the coffin.

448
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,540
Dead.

449
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,040
That's it.

450
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,940
That's it.

451
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,480
There's a bunch of fanfics.

452
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,340
I could've... I could've... I could've gone another day.

453
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,220
I could've... I could've been dead another day not knowing that.

454
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:16,680
Thank you.

455
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,960
Okay.

456
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,600
Merry Gear Solid 2.

457
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,320
Ghosts of Christmas past.

458
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,380
Oh, maybe I should've channeled the ghosts of Christmas past.

459
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,300
Ghosts of Christmas past.

460
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:37,220
You... young version of me.

461
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,780
Don't... eat that dirt.

462
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,120
You'll get ringworm.

463
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,210
A good lesson for all of us.

464
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,360
Okay then.

465
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,420
Now I want Oreo.

466
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,980
Thinking of like those ice creams with the gummy worms in it.

467
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,700
Now I want Oreo.

468
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:22,920
Oreo.

469
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,300
So this is a fan game.

470
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,060
I played the first one.

471
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,820
Now we're playing the second one.

472
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,620
And look at that.

473
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,160
It's so much like...

474
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,520
It's so... It's... It's very...

475
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,080
It feels... It feels...

476
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,380
Really polished, that's the word.

477
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,680
Spoofy, yeah!

478
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,540
And I guess we're gonna be old...

479
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,920
San... Snake... Santa...

480
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,100
San... I don't know.

481
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,000
Sans!

482
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,740
We're gonna be old Sans!

483
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,740
New game!

484
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,580
Control.

485
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,120
Are you sure?

486
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:03,720
Yes.

487
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,640
Naughty.

488
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
Album introduction

489
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,700
Perfect intro music.

490
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,040
Thank you Takeso Thank you.

491
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,840
So appreciative to spend Christmas with you this year in the west.

492
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,220
Yeah!

493
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,880
Me too.

494
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,540
Are these children slaves?

495
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,710
Minky, minky, minky, minky...

496
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,220
It's just my imagination.

497
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,560
Wow, these children are talking!

498
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,920
Based on Metal Gear Solid by Hideo Kojima.

499
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,940
Hopefully I don't block so much.

500
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,690
If I do, I can put my arms down, but...

501
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,040
I don't want to do that.

502
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,500
It's unnatural.

503
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,160
Holy loud!

504
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,960
I like how it's a mix of so many things.

505
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,160
It's Snake?

506
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,880
It's such a mix of all the different Metal Gear games.

507
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,880
Sore throat Otacon.

508
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,800
LOL

509
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,160
Otacon's eyes be like...

510
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,480
Big Beep, Big Beep, Big Beep.

511
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,020
SOC System?

512
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,820
LOL

513
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:17,160
LOL LOL That's me!

514
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,220
That's me!

515
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,200
How they're saving is great.

516
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,560
Oh my god!

517
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,040
Oh no!

518
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,440
LOL

519
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,280
Metal Gear.

520
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,820
The ghosts!

521
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,120
The president's at the mall?

522
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,560
What's wrong with my old codename?

523
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,220
Are these not already codenames?

524
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,080
The Ha-Hu-Hu-Hu.

525
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,120
Cold Snake?

526
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:45,740
Got it.

527
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,800
LOL Thanks!

528
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,780
Oh my gosh.

529
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,440
Wow!

530
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,500
Look how fancy this is now!

531
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,300
Oh my god!

532
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,480
Look at the little Cold Snake!

533
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,100
That's today.

534
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,240
I see.

535
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,400
Wait.

536
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,820
Those are the stairs I think.

537
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:48,670
No, go back to sleep kid.

538
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,030
It's ok.

539
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,670
This kid's voice.

540
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,330
I feel asleep.

541
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,310
How do I sneak?

542
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,440
We're fine.

543
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,950
Ok, good to know it's over.

544
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,070
Is this a door?

545
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,410
No, I can't go there.

546
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,430
I feel asleep.

547
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,870
Oh wait, I see it down there.

548
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,170
Shift, wall hug, control, action.

549
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:45,030
Just from the intro alone you can tell the big differences between Merry Gear 1 and 2.

550
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:45,990
What!?

551
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,390
I didn't even do anything!

552
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,890
I was reading in Super Chat!

553
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,560
Oh my god!

554
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,660
I wasn't doing anything!

555
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,860
I didn't even move!

556
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,020
Oh my god.

557
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,420
Sorry guys, my stomach is like...

558
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,680
Holy moly.

559
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,420
Holy night.

560
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,460
I'm gonna run for it.

561
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,960
Oh ok, nevermind.

562
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,840
He just...I thought it was because he heard me.

563
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,620
Ok.

564
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,360
Ok.

565
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,180
Oh my goodness!

566
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,940
It's icy.

567
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,320
I can't see.

568
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,120
Oh ok.

569
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,280
We're fine.

570
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,320
Otacon, what do I do about this child?

571
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,520
To do that, hug a wall with the shift key and then press the control key to make a noise.

572
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,160
Any nearby guards will come investigate the source of the noise.

573
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,900
You can use this to open up a sneaking path.

574
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,860
So I press control while hugging a wall to knock on it.

575
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,820
Got it.

576
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,660
Say, Otacon.

577
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,480
Knock knock.

578
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,280
What was that noise?

579
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,700
You're supposed to say who's there.

580
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,700
It's just my imagination.

581
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,000
Another thing I've been watching.

582
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,800
So there's this one guy...

583
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh my gosh, I can't remember his username right now.

584
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,940
It's a Japanese...or rather...I think it's a Japanese guy.

585
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:36,120
He plays so much Metal Gear Solid 3.

586
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,260
Like an insane amount.

587
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,700
Like, he is so...

588
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,440
His methods are like so crazy.

589
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,060
And so I was watching him play today.

590
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,180
Big Saru.

591
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,340
I'm pretty sure that's him.

592
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,980
Monkey Mask videos.

593
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,420
Yes!

594
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:54,680
Yes!

595
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,680
I love his videos so much.

596
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,600
Nicholas, welcome to bamboo ship.

597
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,320
Thank you.

598
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,220
Oh my gosh, he's so crazy.

599
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,860
I love watching his stuff.

600
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,480
He's actually like...

601
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,320
It's so fun because it's not like a speedrun.

602
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,580
He just does it because he's just like...

603
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,920
Craziness, you know?

604
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,120
Like it's just so funny.

605
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,240
Let's see.

606
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,700
If I knock...Oh, I can't get in here.

607
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,800
I was gonna knock...Oh wait, I can.

608
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,320
So, shift...

609
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,220
Do you think he'll see me?

610
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,140
Stupid kid.

611
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,020
Dumbass kid.

612
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,020
Stupid.

613
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,620
Oh god, you guys.

614
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,600
I'm so sorry.

615
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,920
I'm gonna take some stomach medicine right now.

616
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,520
I took some medicine earlier, but...

617
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,720
Maybe I need...

618
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,920
Found the intruder.

619
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,300
Oh my god.

620
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,240
Heckin' kid, man.

621
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,080
Heckin' kids.

622
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,880
Oh gosh.

623
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,780
The music.

624
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,480
Oh my gosh, we have like an actual...

625
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,980
Radar now.

626
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,820
Oh my gosh, look at it.

627
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,540
Hold on.

628
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,240
Sorry, this is the worst my stomach has been in a bit.

629
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,900
Can I open this?

630
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,100
Open, please.

631
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,340
Open!

632
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,300
I have to use my teeth.

633
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,180
Microplastics.

634
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,580
Yeah, I'm cosplaying Johnny.

635
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,340
Okay, I got it.

636
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,180
I got it.

637
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:07,780
I got it.

638
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,340
I got it.

639
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,340
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

640
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,570
Hello?

641
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,710
The Joliton Radar.

642
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,390
Joliton?

643
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,310
Joliton.

644
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:54,890
Being dead and still dealing with stomach aches sounds awful, Minto.

645
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,590
Not gonna lie.

646
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:56,670
That's what I told you.

647
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,330
Being a ghost, being dead is overrated.

648
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:04,470
Okay.

649
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,030
Yeah.

650
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,650
No.

651
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,610
What a nerd.

652
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:33,130
Nerd.

653
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,810
Radar and multiple soundtracks.

654
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,770
It is a big leap.

655
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:48,790
It is a big leap.

656
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,350
Alright, so what do these kids do?

657
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,110
Can I walk?

658
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,220
Oh, oops.

659
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,780
I thought he was...

660
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,160
I thought he was gonna walk.

661
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,100
Why didn't he move?

662
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,960
Why didn't he move?

663
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:31,980
Gotcha.

664
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,820
Gotcha.

665
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,100
Gotcha.

666
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,540
This kid is annoying.

667
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,940
Gotcha.

668
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,360
Okay.

669
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,300
For the camera.

670
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,520
Otacon, what do I do?

671
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,300
Oh.

672
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,120
I just knew that.

673
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,940
Wow.

674
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,160
So just this.

675
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:03,740
Gotcha.

676
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,080
Gotcha.

677
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,720
Gotcha.

678
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,540
Hold up, Snake.

679
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,580
Someone's conversation is being carried through the ventilation shaft.

680
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,360
Yes, sir.

681
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,440
Sharp voice and chilly voice.

682
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:47,960
What?

683
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,720
I'm sorry, this is a mall with 20 floors?

684
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,840
You can tell this was made long ago.

685
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,120
You can tell this was made long ago because they had enough confidence to think that malls would be so big.

686
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,020
It's a super mall for real.

687
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,000
Let's see.

688
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,700
Okay, we gotta get to that elevator there.

689
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,340
It's got this little punk looking...

690
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,680
Oh, there's a guy right there.

691
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,480
I thought he was...

692
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,100
I'm here.

693
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,740
What?

694
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,380
Okay.

695
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,300
I guess I'll go this way then.

696
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,640
Oh, this is a way through.

697
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,140
That's neat.

698
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,460
Gosh.

699
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,080
Oh my God.

700
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,420
Hello?

701
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:06,860
Scary.

702
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,360
Hello?

703
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,540
I am?

704
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,400
Okay, I'll go that way then.

705
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,300
Spirit Halloween.

706
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,220
Spirit...what was it?

707
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,140
Spirit Christmas.

708
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:31,960
A new one.

709
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,540
Am I in the storage room?

710
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,080
There's a kid in here.

711
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,760
Why can't I kill the kids?

712
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,480
I mean, take them out.

713
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,420
Oh my God.

714
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,640
I'm running for it.

715
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,440
Oh, this is a bathroom.

716
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,460
This is not where I thought I needed to be.

717
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,980
It's right there.

718
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:02,660
Oopsie.

719
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,480
Oh my gosh.

720
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,580
The other kid came in.

721
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,860
Spooked me.

722
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,450
I'm gonna wake him up with my footsteps.

723
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,640
Oh,

724
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,140
okay.

725
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,990
I'm like moonwalking.

726
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:50,510
Spirit Halloween has a market cap of 1.86 billion dollars and is owned by Spencers.

727
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,190
Yes, that's Spencers.

728
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,230
I got a Dina mask.

729
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:00,230
Shmovin'?

730
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,650
Does Mito mean convert them to ghosts?

731
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:09,950
Nah.

732
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,550
I want you to know that Ferdom has been around for a long time.

733
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:14,090
Huh?

734
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:14,970
Ferdom?

735
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,490
Yeah, you know, furries.

736
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:21,150
It's a fandom that revolves around anthropomorphic animals.

737
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:21,430
Anime.

738
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,910
It's always anime with you, isn't it, Avacon?

739
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:25,550
I'm a mercenary.

740
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,890
I don't have time for any nerd hobbies.

741
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:30,050
Now tell me how I can use this thing.

742
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,570
Well, for a start, it's frighteningly realistic.

743
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,590
Has it got a red light up nose?

744
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:35,390
Nope.

745
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:36,150
Darn.

746
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,370
So it's no good as a flashlight either.

747
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:40,010
Let me put this thing on.

748
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,670
Maybe it'll give me some ideas.

749
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,670
Oh wait, I forgot...

750
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:48,130
I forgot to put on my eyepatch.

751
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:48,150
Sorry.

752
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,270
Oh, it's a deer mask!

753
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,610
Oh really?

754
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:00,950
What?

755
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:08,650
OK OK Oh no, that kid's waking up.

756
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:11,710
Oh no!

757
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,090
Wait, how do I put it on?

758
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:22,590
How do I put it on?

759
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:24,610
A Z?

760
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,890
A deer mask.

761
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:33,670
It allows the user to be undetectable when standing while hugging a wall.

762
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,270
Oh my god, look at that!

763
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:39,150
I'm moonwalking?

764
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,090
Uh, kid?

765
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:43,350
Are you gonna do anything?

766
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,970
He's camping me.

767
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:50,850
Hello?

768
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,650
Just a deer.

769
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,300
Um, let's see.

770
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,020
If I...

771
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,200
Oh, uh, shoot.

772
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,460
OK This might be good.

773
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,000
Alright.

774
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:16,680
OK

775
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,510
He's not gonna come by me, is he?

776
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:34,550
Oh my god, don't touch me.

777
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:35,650
Oh my god.

778
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,770
Uh, oh, shoot.

779
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,150
Uh...

780
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,740
Stinkin' kid.

781
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:56,960
Stinkin' kid!

782
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,520
OK, uh, what is it?

783
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:02,740
Z?

784
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,560
Deer mask, OK.

785
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,000
Um, let's see.

786
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,660
How do I wanna get away from this kid?

787
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:19,570
I think I'm just gonna have to run for it.

788
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:26,580
Hi!

789
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,620
OK, there we go.

790
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,980
Can he see me here?

791
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:42,940
Can't tell.

792
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,520
Oh, I'm like, right in his cone though.

793
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,200
Run!

794
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,520
I'm just a deer.

795
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,220
Where am I?

796
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,480
I think I'm blocked by those boxes there.

797
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,220
Yeah, yeah.

798
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,220
Thanks, Ehi!

799
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,820
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't think you got the hot dog, Gachou.

800
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,520
I don't think you got it.

801
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,840
OK, I think we're blocked by the boxes.

802
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,800
We need to go down.

803
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,280
Hmm...

804
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,300
He's looking, he's looking.

805
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,600
Look over to the left.

806
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,340
Oh, stinking other kid.

807
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,420
Uh oh, I think I'm trapped.

808
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,240
No, I'm not.

809
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:40,860
I'm good.

810
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,640
Oops.

811
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,180
They heard nothing.

812
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,140
Anyway...

813
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,000
Outer saving.

814
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,540
What the heck is this?

815
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,460
Did I go to the wrong place?

816
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:17,120
Wow, they took every measure.

817
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,500
Do I sound like a girl to you?

818
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:43,260
He sounds like Liquid too.

819
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,620
The gas.

820
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,200
That makes sense.

821
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,360
I thought he was going to be like, call me Frosty.

822
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,620
Such a lust for Christmas cheer.

823
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,420
He didn't hear it.

824
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,260
Of what?

825
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,140
No.

826
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:47,580
Wow, thanks Otacon.

827
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,920
This is so silly.

828
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:58,980
No.

829
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,100
Okay.

830
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,840
I love the deer.

831
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,960
Oh my god, stop calling me.

832
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,200
The what?

833
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,200
Okay, is that a good thing or...

834
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:22,900
The Muzak.

835
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,820
Oh my god.

836
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,380
One of them is still asleep, this little slacker.

837
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,020
Slacking kid.

838
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,480
Oh, what's that?

839
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,920
I want whatever that is.

840
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,780
Oh my god, that scared the hell out of me.

841
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,520
Oh my god.

842
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,400
Oh my god, that scared me.

843
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,360
Genuine scream.

844
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,780
Oh my god.

845
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,240
Let's...

846
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,140
Yeah, but I want it.

847
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,060
What?

848
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,560
He doesn't believe in me.

849
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,700
He doesn't believe in me.

850
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,940
Thanks for the Aqua Super!

851
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:28,780
Thank you!

852
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,480
Merry Christmas, boss.

853
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,360
Merry Christmas!

854
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,480
I think I can get it.

855
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,280
Let's see, how would I...

856
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,180
Can you crawl?

857
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:50,880
You cannot.

858
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,240
Let's see, maybe if I...

859
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,200
I don't know how to...

860
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,360
Snap his neck.

861
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,260
It's a child!

862
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:07,960
If I knock, I'm still trying to figure out how I sneak past him.

863
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,580
Put socks over your boots.

864
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,560
Because as soon as I move, he's gonna hear it, you know?

865
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,240
I wish I could CQC the kids.

866
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,300
Maybe Otacon's got a point.

867
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,180
We'll come back.

868
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,120
We're not gonna be getting Elf rank in this, I'm afraid.

869
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:47,820
I

870
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,900
have a laser vision!

871
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,100
I got stuck on the wall, you little brat!

872
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,600
You're getting cold.

873
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,620
You're getting cold for Christmas.

874
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,940
Nothing, nothing good in your stocking.

875
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,020
I have to wait.

876
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,200
OK.

877
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:43,870
Alright, let's see.

878
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:46,790
Is this... Oh, this is the ice!

879
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:57,590
Guess who's getting terrible rank.

880
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:58,790
It's me!

881
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:00,210
It's Amito!

882
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:02,970
Oh my god.

883
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:04,810
Oh my god.

884
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:04,950
Oh my god.

885
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,160
Once...

886
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:27,880
OK.

887
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,900
Where am I?

888
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,410
Why is this mall so confusing?

889
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,280
How do I... I think I might have to go all the way around though.

890
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:08,230
This is how I feel like when you're a kid and you go to the mall.

891
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:12,470
This is how I feel like probably a kid's interpretation of the mall is, you know?

892
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,010
Where they're just like... Oh, it's just so genuinely confusing.

893
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:17,170
Confusing.

894
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:22,190
Oh shit.

895
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:23,650
Oh shit.

896
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:28,810
OK, I think we're good actually.

897
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:36,980
I can trick the children.

898
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,680
Wait, how do I get through?

899
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:43,120
Oh, I think I messed up.

900
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,940
Wait, where's the... How do I get over there?

901
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,500
Did I go the wrong way?

902
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,500
Was there even anything over there?

903
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:02,210
Oops.

904
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:09,970
I'm sliding?

905
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,110
I see... OK.

906
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,090
I think I got so distracted by...

907
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:15,790
Here we go.

908
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:16,990
There's this.

909
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:19,910
Curious what's in here.

910
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,710
Why does it look so ominous?

911
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:29,550
Raiden?

912
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:30,750
Oh, police?

913
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:56,690
Are there bosses in this game?

914
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:00,030
And there he goes.

915
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:02,330
Thank you for the 50 gifts.

916
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:03,390
Thank you.

917
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,090
Cold.

918
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:24,390
Oh, he keeps drinking.

919
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,690
I don't like that.

920
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,390
These sound effects.

921
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:45,130
Oh my god.

922
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,850
Cheer.

923
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:09,550
Otherwise the milk would spoil.

924
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:11,230
Yeah.

925
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:21,150
Especially if you're lactose intolerant.

926
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:29,270
But I've got no time to dwell in the past.

927
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:34,910
Snake, today is your best buy date.

928
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:38,090
And let me make it milky clear...

929
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:42,290
that you shall be bested by this battle's end.

930
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,590
Oh my god!

931
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:47,030
How do I fight you?

932
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:48,930
Uh...

933
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:57,980
How am I supposed to fight?

934
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:03,920
No he's not!

935
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,920
He's literally right there!

936
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,760
Um... I have nothing to attack him with.

937
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:39,730
Is there like a... a thermostat or something I can turn up?

938
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:43,930
Is there like anything that I can change the...

939
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,450
Otacon, what do I do?

940
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,510
Otacon, the enemy.

941
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:52,050
His blood is white.

942
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:54,070
The last time I've seen that was...

943
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:56,770
That's not white blood Snake, that's milk.

944
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:57,430
Milk?

945
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:57,770
Milk?

946
01:00:58,830 --> 01:00:59,390
What?

947
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,070
I don't even have any weapons.

948
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:12,890
I have... I can't even use my hands.

949
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:13,870
Control does nothing.

950
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:16,110
Control does nothing.

951
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,330
What am I supposed to do?

952
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:29,120
The music is so good.

953
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,160
Attack!

954
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,040
Ouch.

955
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:44,890
Will my... wait, Z?

956
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:48,150
Will my deer do anything?

957
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:50,130
Oops.

958
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:50,870
Oops.

959
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:09,570
I got the shit on him!

960
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:12,870
Throw a... wait.

961
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:17,970
What do you mean?

962
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:19,810
I literally...

963
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:24,750
I have no actions though.

964
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:26,210
So I'm not sure what to do.

965
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,680
Just tolerate it.

966
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:41,480
Drink him.

967
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,540
How do I do that though?

968
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:50,220
Keep getting hit?

969
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,260
Let's try it.

970
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,620
Just gonna stand right here.

971
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,560
Look Snake, we've got to hurry before this situation gets real sour.

972
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,260
I'm actually so confused.

973
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,980
He's got that real Stormtrooper angle.

974
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,060
Sir, I'm right here.

975
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:39,420
Is there... I didn't see like a thermostat or anything to make it hot in here or anything.

976
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:45,950
You can't get past the boxes.

977
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:49,630
I'm just kind of like...

978
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:52,230
I feel like I'm just stuck.

979
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,410
I'm not taking damage, no.

980
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,840
Maybe?

981
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:06,600
Hold on.

982
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:08,300
How?

983
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,700
Yes!

984
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:15,920
What?

985
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:16,960
Are you serious?

986
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,500
Wait, actually?

987
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:23,880
But it's Christmas!

988
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:25,420
No way.

989
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:26,600
Wait.

990
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,460
Clock.

991
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:37,410
Icon.

992
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:44,830
Date and time.

993
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:45,530
Wait.

994
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:49,330
Set time automatically turn off.

995
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:51,690
Set the date and time manually.

996
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:55,650
I'm gonna change it to... Oh my gosh, I'm gonna change it to...

997
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:59,590
I'm gonna change it to December 25th, 2025!

998
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,380
Oh my God, it worked!

999
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,420
It worked!

1000
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,620
This is so funny.

1001
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:33,020
My chat disconnected.

1002
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:33,700
Oh no!

1003
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,560
My father.

1004
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:41,220
My father was one of the three wise men.

1005
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:41,940
Are you guys still here?

1006
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:45,180
My internet.

1007
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:52,120
He was well on his way to inherit the title of Father Christmas.

1008
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:56,920
When in a freak accident at San Geronimo.

1009
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,080
His body literally burned itself up.

1010
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,280
That special blue fox sneaking suit.

1011
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,220
You must be Python's kid.

1012
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,920
Am I still streaming?

1013
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,020
I can't tell at all.

1014
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,720
What the hell is going on?

1015
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:26,260
What's happening?

1016
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:27,480
Why am I frozen?

1017
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,420
What is going on?

1018
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,240
What's happening?

1019
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:57,480
I'm still streaming.

1020
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,280
Ok, hold on.

1021
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,700
I'm still streaming.

1022
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:15,460
Why am I frozen?

1023
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,680
Help me!

1024
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:34,400
What?

1025
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,420
I'm not even paying attention.

1026
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:58,440
I'm sorry Milkman.

1027
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,420
I changed the date back, yeah.

1028
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,140
It ruined everything on my computer.

1029
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,940
Oh my goodness.

1030
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,440
Merry Gear?

1031
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,960
Is this help?

1032
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,740
This is so silly.

1033
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,080
Frosty?

1034
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,180
I'm still here by the way.

1035
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:18,900
I'm just here.

1036
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:23,940
Frosty?

1037
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,680
What?

1038
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:45,480
So that's why the ghosts are demanding Nick's brain.

1039
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:05,720
We had planned to obtain Saint Nick's brain and extract the final passcode.

1040
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,980
Giving us access to the Merry Gear.

1041
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,660
But how would this help you deliver your milk?

1042
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:16,680
Snake, you aren't thinking outside of the box.

1043
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:23,000
Or rather, perhaps that is exactly what you are doing.

1044
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,360
What do you mean?

1045
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,780
Think, Snake.

1046
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:33,160
If the Merry Gear is only capable of launching gift boxes...

1047
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,440
Put the milk in a gift box.

1048
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,180
Yes!

1049
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:38,000
The greatest gift of all!

1050
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,320
I don't think anybody wants boxed milk.

1051
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:52,800
Snake, it was only my dream to make the world a happier place through milk.

1052
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,800
It seems that your dreams have expired.

1053
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,140
And I along with them.

1054
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,260
But don't cry.

1055
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,420
I'll be back again someday.

1056
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:21,130
I guess there's no use crying over spilled milk.

1057
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,120
The present!

1058
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:34,700
Zeshu, happy birthday!

1059
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:37,900
Oh,

1060
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:45,120
the music spooked me.

1061
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:46,820
Happy birthday!

1062
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:48,220
Happy birthday to you!

1063
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:51,600
Happy birthday, dear Zeshu!

1064
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,460
Happy birthday to you!

1065
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,000
Happy birthday!

1066
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:03,480
Alright, we got our first boss.

1067
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,280
At what cost?

1068
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:06,420
Truly.

1069
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,720
Oh wait, hold on.

1070
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,280
My settings are all messed up now.

1071
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,380
That's one down, Snake.

1072
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,620
Just two more to go.

1073
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:17,340
If I remember correctly, one of the ghosts is on the first floor.

1074
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:19,280
Continue making your way down there.

1075
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,620
That's where we've been trying to go.

1076
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,380
Cold Snake needs some sunglasses after that finishing phrase.

1077
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,000
Okay,

1078
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:30,940
there we go.

1079
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:31,520
Alrighty.

1080
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,200
I'm gonna put my deer mask back on.

1081
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,200
Very next to...

1082
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:57,350
If I...

1083
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:01,750
Will they come all the way up here?

1084
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:07,270
Oh, I think I did need to...

1085
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:09,690
distract them like that.

1086
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:11,730
This little brat!

1087
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:13,330
Ah, screw you!

1088
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,630
You were supposed to look awesome!

1089
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:23,090
I see Psycho Mintus messing up your setup.

1090
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:25,510
At least we got a Portable Ops reference in the game.

1091
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:29,290
The second kid!

1092
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,020
Oh, I

1093
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:47,140
messed up.

1094
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,200
I messed up.

1095
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:55,140
Honestly, this game is dope.

1096
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:56,700
It's such an improvement.

1097
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:58,280
Like, it's kind of insane.

1098
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:01,280
How much they have changed and...

1099
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:08,330
Okay, now while they are up here...

1100
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:14,590
Wait!

1101
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:17,550
I messed up again.

1102
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:19,910
Why do you go all the way up there?

1103
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:20,930
I hate this kid!

1104
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:21,970
Let me murder!

1105
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:23,850
Let me murder, please!

1106
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:25,390
I got you!

1107
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:26,590
Thank you for the 50 Gems!

1108
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,030
Thank you so much!

1109
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:30,550
Why does he go all the way up?

1110
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:35,510
Okay, I think I know what I'm going to do instead.

1111
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,260
I'm going to go here instead.

1112
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,440
Stupid kids.

1113
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,140
Stupid ass kids.

1114
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,480
You should be asleep.

1115
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,160
Naomi is hunting supplies!

1116
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:09,590
I hear Ocelot.

1117
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:14,070
Exotic survival cuisine.

1118
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:15,910
Six buffets.

1119
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:19,370
More than enough to fuel anything that moves.

1120
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:24,010
Six buffets?

1121
01:15:24,170 --> 01:15:28,210
More than enough to refuel anything that moves?

1122
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:31,070
The revolving omelette.

1123
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,690
What is this?

1124
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,880
Exotic survival cuisine.

1125
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:41,740
Six buffets.

1126
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:45,320
More than enough to fuel anything that moves.

1127
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,780
Oh fill, not fuel.

1128
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:47,480
My bad.

1129
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:48,880
Oh my gosh, still though.

1130
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,980
That is so... omelette.

1131
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:55,980
Oh my goodness, this is so good.

1132
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:57,420
Outer.

1133
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,360
Is this the first floor?

1134
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:00,880
Are we here?

1135
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:06,110
These kids won't see me, right?

1136
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:06,870
Just kidding.

1137
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:07,570
Oh, just kidding.

1138
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:23,910
Galloway Gardens?

1139
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,510
I just realized the names.

1140
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:30,090
Merry Christmas!

1141
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:50,130
This Eden place is taken strays?

1142
01:16:57,210 --> 01:16:58,570
Oh my gosh, Bankuro!

1143
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:03,610
The cookie recipe you blessed a few days ago won first at the Christmas party.

1144
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:08,770
I'm entering them as Minto blessed cookies in my recipe book.

1145
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:09,590
Not published.

1146
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:10,770
Oh my gosh!

1147
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,610
I hope you got something good for it.

1148
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:14,570
Wait, where am I?

1149
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:19,320
What is going on?

1150
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,200
Is that kid throwing up?

1151
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:24,840
What's happening?

1152
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,000
Is he okay?

1153
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,600
Am I making a break for it?

1154
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:34,980
Let's see.

1155
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:37,860
Nothing here.

1156
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,800
I know we have to distract this guy.

1157
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,960
Just figuring out how I want to do it.

1158
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:47,040
Hey, I'm pressing shift.

1159
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,280
Why am I not hugging the wall?

1160
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,360
And there's a security camera.

1161
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:05,650
This is like it's own thing.

1162
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:06,610
Oh, I see.

1163
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:09,010
Oh, because I can hide behind it.

1164
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:13,610
So maybe if I like...

1165
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:15,790
Wait.

1166
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:18,370
I think

1167
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,400
I'll have enough time to...

1168
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:27,820
Okay, hold on.

1169
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:32,580
You think he'll...

1170
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,340
Oh, you stinking kid!

1171
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:35,420
What the hell?

1172
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,620
Why didn't you go around the tree?

1173
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,180
I hate kids.

1174
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,360
I have to do this all over again.

1175
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:49,320
I need this guy to go puke his brains out again.

1176
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:57,870
Whatever he's doing over here.

1177
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:08,370
How do I distract him?

1178
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:27,430
I

1179
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:34,840
could do that.

1180
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:45,850
Dummy kid.

1181
01:19:47,610 --> 01:19:48,650
Stupid kid.

1182
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:54,340
Dummy kid.

1183
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,740
Oh, now we have another dummy kid.

1184
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:04,540
How does this game compare with Ghost Babble gameplay wise?

1185
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,740
I don't know.

1186
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,540
It's hard to say.

1187
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:12,960
Okay.

1188
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:17,060
Do not mind the entire deer-headed mountain.

1189
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:20,040
Deer-headed mountain onto the side of the Christmas tree.

1190
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,440
Yeah, don't worry about it.

1191
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,460
Don't even think about it.

1192
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,200
It's fine.

1193
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:25,860
Okay, hold on.

1194
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:28,240
Wait.

1195
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,100
This might be risky.

1196
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,600
But we gotta take risks.

1197
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,480
Why are there so many kids?

1198
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:56,220
Oh.

1199
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,660
Intruder to the left.

1200
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,680
Intruder to the right.

1201
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,480
That's how I feel about this scene.

1202
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,200
Gonna wait.

1203
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,400
Easy.

1204
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,440
Everyone loves a nice rack.

1205
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:24,680
No need to question it.

1206
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,560
True.

1207
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:30,740
Okay.

1208
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,600
Check the storage room.

1209
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:36,600
Okay.

1210
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:38,020
What's up here?

1211
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,200
Zone of the Fenders?

1212
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,980
This is too much.

1213
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:49,020
How are the puns so tough?

1214
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:49,880
Sorry, hold on.

1215
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:51,360
I'm adjusting my computer.

1216
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:52,080
There we go.

1217
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,040
What's the other one?

1218
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:07,570
Not a cotton.

1219
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:08,550
I'm surrounded.

1220
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:15,730
Jeez, do you do that every time I get caught?

1221
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:17,170
Yeah.

1222
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:19,210
How'd you manage to escape alive?

1223
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:21,250
Turns out these kids are mannequins.

1224
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:22,110
Mannequins?

1225
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:23,310
Oh, that's right.

1226
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,650
You're in a children's clothing store.

1227
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:28,490
Still, you'll want to be extra careful there.

1228
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,970
That's the perfect place to set up an ambush.

1229
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:32,410
That's what they said that there was gonna be.

1230
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:35,170
If only your radar wasn't jammed, you'd be able to avoid the real guards.

1231
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,510
Maybe you should try to do something about that and come back later.

1232
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:54,750
What's the storage closet?

1233
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:06,910
I said I wanted to go.

1234
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:09,210
Wait, where's the storage closet though?

1235
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:09,570
Is it here?

1236
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:14,590
Over here?

1237
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:24,540
Really giving that full liminal space experience that lots of models have nowadays.

1238
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:29,600
Oh my god.

1239
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,360
Am I going the right way?

1240
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:41,090
It wasn't me.

1241
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:44,830
Otacon, there's a sleeping kid in here with a note taped to his back.

1242
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:45,610
What's it say?

1243
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:47,270
Now I have a polar gun.

1244
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:48,590
Ho, ho, ho.

1245
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:51,530
Looks like this elevator is no good either.

1246
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:53,370
Now this is an elevator?

1247
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:57,250
Interesting.

1248
01:23:58,030 --> 01:24:04,270
Okay, so now we have to go all the way back to the revolver amulet.

1249
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:12,130
That's a Die Hard reference!

1250
01:24:12,710 --> 01:24:13,190
Oops.

1251
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:21,830
I only watched Die Hard once.

1252
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:25,890
So they turn to the right.

1253
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:28,250
Intruder to the right!

1254
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:32,230
Nothing?

1255
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:36,450
Go back to your position, kid.

1256
01:24:37,470 --> 01:24:39,070
Go back to your position, kid.

1257
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:41,230
I'm not sure what that means.

1258
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:42,970
Stupid kid.

1259
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:43,810
God.

1260
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:45,870
Stupid ass little kid.

1261
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:47,850
With his eagle eyes.

1262
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,430
Why can't you be a kid that needs glasses, huh?

1263
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,580
I just watched that movie, A Christmas Classic.

1264
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,780
It truly is.

1265
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:27,530
Excuse me?

1266
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:29,890
Oh, he saw me!

1267
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:31,690
Cause he was looking to the left!

1268
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:33,190
Or to the right!

1269
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:35,990
I didn't notice.

1270
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:36,570
What?

1271
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:38,110
Six buffets.

1272
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:39,990
Enough to satiate anything that moves.

1273
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:42,850
Hope your tummy feels better.

1274
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:43,790
Thank you, Akira.

1275
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:45,170
Appreciate it.

1276
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:50,310
I'm stuck?

1277
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:52,770
I was stuck for a second?

1278
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:55,450
Okay, hold on.

1279
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:56,510
Oh my gosh.

1280
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:58,190
Oh wait, no?

1281
01:25:58,330 --> 01:25:58,650
Waiting?

1282
01:25:59,390 --> 01:25:59,630
Okay.

1283
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:06,110
When they look to the right, it's truly the only time I can go.

1284
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,680
Now!

1285
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:17,020
Now...

1286
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:17,560
Go.

1287
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:18,760
Go, go, go, go.

1288
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:22,020
Hold!

1289
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:23,000
Hold positions.

1290
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:27,000
Wait, now I have to go...

1291
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,340
This kind of sucks.

1292
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,980
I now have to go all the way back.

1293
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:33,100
Spent all day visiting family.

1294
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,620
I hope you and the Wisps are having a wonderful Christmas.

1295
01:26:59,610 --> 01:27:02,250
The BGM got so loud all of a sudden.

1296
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:05,830
Jolly?

1297
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:06,930
What do I do here?

1298
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:12,930
A tranq gun would be good.

1299
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:13,710
I know, right?

1300
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:18,970
It's kind of frustrating that it's like European extreme mode where if I get caught...

1301
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:21,770
I truly don't know how to move here.

1302
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,040
Distract him behind the pillar.

1303
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:32,580
Like over here?

1304
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:41,540
I didn't know if that would go as far as it did.

1305
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,580
Okay, nice.

1306
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:58,150
Where do I want to distract this guy from?

1307
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,500
Sorry, I'm an idiot.

1308
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,960
Hearing you sing hippopotamus for Christmas made my holiday season.

1309
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,140
No way, really?

1310
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,440
Glad you liked it that much.

1311
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:21,780
What was that?

1312
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,580
It's okay, we can get back there pretty quickly.

1313
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:36,780
Just the wind.

1314
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:43,480
Oh my god.

1315
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,040
There we go.

1316
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:50,790
Silliness averted.

1317
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,820
What do we do about this kid though?

1318
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,180
Oh my god, he's coming in.

1319
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:00,520
Oh my god.

1320
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,160
Turn around.

1321
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,140
Turn around diarrhea boy.

1322
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:06,440
I almost moved.

1323
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,100
Punch him.

1324
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:15,060
I wish I could.

1325
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:16,940
If I could, I would.

1326
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,740
I would not hesitate to punch the children.

1327
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:21,040
If I could.

1328
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:22,440
Just saying.

1329
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:22,500
Just saying.

1330
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,000
Would not hesitate.

1331
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:33,440
Okay, it's open.

1332
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,780
Six buffets, huh?

1333
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,660
This looks... Wait, are these the tables?

1334
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:49,300
Where is the buffet?

1335
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,120
A kid.

1336
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:57,540
What is he saying?

1337
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:58,700
Oh my god.

1338
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,160
Oh, let's eat.

1339
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,040
Oh my god.

1340
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:06,860
Oh, so he's like, I think I can hide behind each of these.

1341
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:14,450
Toast?

1342
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:20,730
What did he...

1343
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:24,230
What?

1344
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:26,150
What?

1345
01:30:28,910 --> 01:30:31,770
Why would this be useful to me?

1346
01:30:36,370 --> 01:30:37,410
Power?

1347
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:47,590
Where did he get the jam?

1348
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:56,490
What?

1349
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:06,750
Oh, so here.

1350
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:08,910
Toast.

1351
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:16,800
This is exhilarating.

1352
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,320
These crab cakes.

1353
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:26,280
Hey, I'm the creator of this game.

1354
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:27,540
What?

1355
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,640
No way!

1356
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:31,660
Thanks for checking it out.

1357
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:36,080
Just wanted to let you know you missed a pretty important item in the upper right corner of the room before the boss fight.

1358
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:37,480
Good luck.

1359
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,340
Oh, thank you!

1360
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:40,100
What?

1361
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:40,980
No way!

1362
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:47,340
Okay, we have to go head back that way then.

1363
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:49,760
Important item in the... Wait, where was it?

1364
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,980
I... The game is insane.

1365
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:56,320
It has so many fun...

1366
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,520
So many fun references.

1367
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:01,100
Where was it?

1368
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:01,900
Where was that?

1369
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:05,800
Important item in the upper right corner of the room before the boss fight.

1370
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:08,140
Okay, we gotta go back.

1371
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,640
Wait, I need my deer head.

1372
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:13,800
Oh my gosh, wait.

1373
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:16,220
How am I supposed to distract these kids?

1374
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,700
They're like the dang kids from The Shining.

1375
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,620
Let's do here.

1376
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:29,430
See ya, kid.

1377
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,290
See ya, kids.

1378
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:34,850
And then maybe...

1379
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:39,170
Okay, so this is... Okay, top right.

1380
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:40,790
I'm gonna go get the item.

1381
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:54,700
I'm assuming it's this room over here because I think I went to the left and I just didn't explore the right.

1382
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:59,660
Yeah, because I messed up.

1383
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:00,760
I remember.

1384
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:08,050
Nothin'?

1385
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:09,810
Nothin'?

1386
01:33:09,810 --> 01:33:11,010
Nothin'?

1387
01:33:11,010 --> 01:33:12,570
Nothin'?

1388
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:15,830
We moonwalked?

1389
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:25,710
Okay.

1390
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:28,750
He's gonna look over.

1391
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:33,980
He's gonna look over.

1392
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:39,340
Nope.

1393
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:40,100
Nope.

1394
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:40,880
Nothing.

1395
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:45,440
Merry Christmas, Mito.

1396
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,140
Christmas outfit is so cute.

1397
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:48,280
Thank you.

1398
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:53,180
Yeah, I didn't realize that I could walk over here so I was like...

1399
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,300
You little punk!

1400
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,480
Punk ass kid.

1401
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:16,510
Punk ass kid.

1402
01:34:16,510 --> 01:34:16,970
Okay.

1403
01:34:18,710 --> 01:34:21,530
Okay, he's gonna look and the camera's gonna look.

1404
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,000
Alright.

1405
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,960
One more time.

1406
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,120
Just my imagination.

1407
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,220
Yeah, just your imagination.

1408
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:39,580
Dummy kid.

1409
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:40,660
Dummy kid.

1410
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:47,240
I don't know where he goes yet.

1411
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:48,940
So I'm scared.

1412
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,380
He's not gonna walk into me, is he?

1413
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,260
Oh my god.

1414
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:53,260
So...

1415
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:54,900
Oh god!

1416
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,000
Stupid kid.

1417
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:04,980
Dummy kid.

1418
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:06,660
Idiot kid.

1419
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:14,410
My toast!

1420
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:19,430
Toast works perfectly here.

1421
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:28,680
You've been in there long enough.

1422
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:30,960
Yell louder.

1423
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:34,620
What?

1424
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:40,220
I'm sorry?

1425
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:43,620
Cooties.

1426
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:48,060
Yeah?

1427
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:57,300
Okay, I'm going then.

1428
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:01,410
There's like...

1429
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:03,780
Will that be able to see me?

1430
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,100
I got it!

1431
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:16,840
Candy cane!

1432
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,200
Why is there a camera in the toilet?

1433
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:23,520
No!

1434
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:23,680
No!

1435
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:40,500
What?

1436
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:43,880
We've been getting drugged!

1437
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,220
This is not true.

1438
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:51,320
I don't know.

1439
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:52,820
I learned a lot from video games.

1440
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:57,200
Nice!

1441
01:36:58,440 --> 01:36:58,920
Thanks!

1442
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,520
Thank you for...

1443
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:03,080
Thank you, Dev, for telling me about this.

1444
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:06,460
Okay, Columbo.

1445
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:13,480
Jennifer!

1446
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:16,320
Thank you for the... for the pink!

1447
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:16,900
Wait, hold on.

1448
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,460
Do I have to equip it?

1449
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:20,020
Okay, yeah.

1450
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Oh my god!

1451
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:36,540
I love this thing!

1452
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:41,580
I had work the past three days and I was at home before that.

1453
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:42,980
I can finally catch a stream again.

1454
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,000
It was my first con and I didn't get to meet you.

1455
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:46,880
No, I'm sorry!

1456
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,500
But I took the podcast to heart and made memories.

1457
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:51,700
Thank you for your wisdom and for being my OG.

1458
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:53,980
I'm glad you had fun!

1459
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:56,960
I didn't kill a child.

1460
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:58,040
Look, he woke up.

1461
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:59,240
He's fine.

1462
01:37:59,380 --> 01:37:59,920
He's fine.

1463
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:03,440
He's okay.

1464
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:05,660
He's fine.

1465
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:07,380
He's okay.

1466
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,200
I finally get to punch the children.

1467
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,180
Okay, now we have to go all the way back.

1468
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:15,640
But no worries.

1469
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,800
Do you think I can, like, get two kids in a row?

1470
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:20,260
Oh, whoops.

1471
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:26,500
Do you think I can get two kids in a row?

1472
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:31,620
How do I want to do this?

1473
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:33,960
Hmm.

1474
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:37,940
Music in this game is just so good.

1475
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,040
I can't get over it.

1476
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:46,220
Oh my god.

1477
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:47,220
Don't come after me.

1478
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:47,600
Okay.

1479
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:49,880
Okay.

1480
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:51,260
Nice.

1481
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:52,300
We made it?

1482
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:53,880
Merry Christmas, Minto!

1483
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,940
I hope it was amazing for you.

1484
01:38:56,020 --> 01:38:56,460
I love the outfit.

1485
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:56,840
It's cute.

1486
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:57,500
Thank you!

1487
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,340
You hit a child?

1488
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:00,500
Great work, boss.

1489
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:05,560
Okie-dokie.

1490
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:06,320
Let's see.

1491
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,240
Oh shi...

1492
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:22,800
I'm gonna have to go all the way from here.

1493
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:25,820
No.

1494
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,240
My big, my big ranking.

1495
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,260
My big guy ranking.

1496
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:42,920
How am I supposed to be a big guy now?

1497
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:44,340
No.

1498
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,400
My ranking big guy.

1499
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:58,100
You're a big guy.

1500
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:01,500
Oh wait.

1501
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:02,320
Okay.

1502
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,980
Oh shi...

1503
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:11,560
I wish I could get past this more easily.

1504
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,320
For you.

1505
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:18,620
For you.

1506
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:20,480
What do you mean for you?

1507
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,200
I hear vertical stripes make you look bigger.

1508
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:28,220
Isn't that horizontal stripes?

1509
01:40:32,710 --> 01:40:33,630
Oh my god.

1510
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:34,150
Look up.

1511
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:34,970
Look up, kid.

1512
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,140
Run!

1513
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:41,720
Run!

1514
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,400
We made it.

1515
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:48,160
Sneak 100.

1516
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:54,580
Milky.

1517
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,260
Milky room.

1518
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:02,680
Little drink break.

1519
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,160
Are you guys staying hydrated?

1520
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,440
Okay, I wanna try something out here now.

1521
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:12,700
If I'm like super fast, can I take both these kids out?

1522
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:14,820
Oh nice, I can.

1523
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,280
We're so good.

1524
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:29,140
It's the forbidden yaoi in the beginning of the Dark Knight Rises.

1525
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:30,780
What are you talking about?

1526
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:33,320
Hey, where did the kids go that were here?

1527
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:37,000
Were those the kids that I knocked out?

1528
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:37,480
No.

1529
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:39,860
Where did they go?

1530
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:43,720
Wait, where did everybody go?

1531
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:46,060
It's quiet.

1532
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:47,860
Too quiet.

1533
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:57,700
Hurrying.

1534
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:58,540
I'm hurrying.

1535
01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:10,990
I'm hurrying.

1536
01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:11,850
I'm hurrying.

1537
01:42:13,390 --> 01:42:15,910
I wanted to use my cane on all of them.

1538
01:42:16,670 --> 01:42:17,650
My Nova cane.

1539
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:23,730
The puns in this game are like 10 out of 10.

1540
01:42:26,510 --> 01:42:28,130
Wasn't there another present you...

1541
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:33,270
I don't remember where that one was.

1542
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:37,690
Quick props for Minto getting far without CQC.

1543
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:39,090
Thanks.

1544
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:43,770
Where was that other one?

1545
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:47,630
The one that was just like oh yeah, you have to knock that kid out.

1546
01:42:48,090 --> 01:42:49,130
Even further back.

1547
01:42:50,210 --> 01:42:50,810
It's OK.

1548
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:52,590
Maybe.

1549
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:53,910
Maybe it's fine.

1550
01:42:54,930 --> 01:42:56,050
Maybe it's fine.

1551
01:42:57,790 --> 01:42:59,490
Maybe we'll somehow loop.

1552
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:03,110
OK, now we got to toast.

1553
01:43:07,090 --> 01:43:11,290
Oh my gosh.

1554
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:13,350
What?

1555
01:43:13,730 --> 01:43:15,290
Oh, I think I ran into him.

1556
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:17,130
Oops.

1557
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:20,510
Probably easy to get there without the kids.

1558
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:21,990
True!

1559
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:25,630
Wait, should we go try because...

1560
01:43:25,630 --> 01:43:27,210
Because there's no kids?

1561
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:30,870
Wait, they might only be gone from this area though.

1562
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:34,110
We can go check real quick.

1563
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:37,210
We can check.

1564
01:43:40,670 --> 01:43:42,150
Why are we fighting kids?

1565
01:43:42,230 --> 01:43:44,750
These kids are under control.

1566
01:43:45,630 --> 01:43:47,010
They're not themselves.

1567
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:47,830
Oh, I'm going to get caught.

1568
01:43:48,030 --> 01:43:48,490
No, I'm not.

1569
01:43:49,910 --> 01:43:51,050
See ya, suckers!

1570
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:53,830
I'm too good.

1571
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:55,710
I'm too good.

1572
01:43:58,090 --> 01:43:59,270
Like the sound of the footsteps.

1573
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:05,490
OK, this will be the real test to see if all the children are gone.

1574
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:08,710
If the kids in this previous area are gone or not.

1575
01:44:12,490 --> 01:44:14,730
Oh wait, it wasn't this area.

1576
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:16,270
Oh, what was it?

1577
01:44:17,870 --> 01:44:18,630
This area?

1578
01:44:19,690 --> 01:44:21,350
Oh no, see, they're still there.

1579
01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:26,610
OK, I don't feel like... Sorry guys, I don't feel like going so, so far back.

1580
01:44:28,130 --> 01:44:29,570
It's OK, it was good to check though.

1581
01:44:30,910 --> 01:44:31,750
It's good to check.

1582
01:44:32,430 --> 01:44:33,430
You're pretty good.

1583
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:37,810
Oops, my bad.

1584
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:40,210
No, it was a good idea, I think.

1585
01:44:41,110 --> 01:44:42,250
I think it was worth checking.

1586
01:44:44,410 --> 01:44:46,750
I think it was worth looking into.

1587
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:53,250
Imagine if they were just like, yeah, all the kids on the entire game are just gone.

1588
01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:56,190
That'd be wild.

1589
01:44:57,390 --> 01:44:59,410
You could just go wherever you please.

1590
01:45:03,610 --> 01:45:05,830
You can just go anywhere you please.

1591
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:11,210
Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.

1592
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:19,390
Alrighty.

1593
01:45:33,550 --> 01:45:34,970
Seems like these ones are fine.

1594
01:45:38,050 --> 01:45:38,470
OK.

1595
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:41,310
Minky goes to the mall.

1596
01:45:41,530 --> 01:45:42,390
Merry Chrysler, Minto.

1597
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:43,270
Merry Chrysler!

1598
01:45:44,090 --> 01:45:45,390
It's quiet in here.

1599
01:45:47,510 --> 01:45:48,330
Too quiet.

1600
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:51,290
Oh, a present.

1601
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:53,770
We got a box!

1602
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:09,350
He's like my cat.

1603
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:21,770
Don't you?

1604
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:36,430
Sneakypedia!

1605
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:41,610
I'm not watching another one of those again.

1606
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:42,250
No, Snake.

1607
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:45,130
This has nothing to do with my Japanese animes.

1608
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:50,550
Sokoku, or locked country, refers to Japan's old foreign relations policy.

1609
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:54,470
Under Sokoku, no Japanese were allowed to leave the country.

1610
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:57,570
At the same time, no foreigners were allowed into the country.

1611
01:46:58,010 --> 01:47:02,210
Remarkably, it marked one of the longest periods of peace in Japanese history.

1612
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:03,010
Oh, brother.

1613
01:47:03,470 --> 01:47:06,090
I can see he's been reading the sneaky page on Japan again.

1614
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:11,670
By sealing yourself in a cardboard box without air holes, you'll be isolating yourself from the outside.

1615
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:15,830
That includes all of the good, but also all of the bad.

1616
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:19,510
I'll still be able to use the box as a stealth device though, right?

1617
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:20,130
That's right.

1618
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:23,330
As long as you're standing still, you'll be disguised to look just like an ordinary cardboard box.

1619
01:47:23,330 --> 01:47:25,290
No, this is easier I think to use than the deer.

1620
01:47:25,470 --> 01:47:25,970
Be careful though.

1621
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:29,830
Don't let any enemies get too close, or your disguise will be ineffective.

1622
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:31,270
Stay out of the enemy's path.

1623
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:32,150
Got it.

1624
01:47:32,150 --> 01:47:35,990
Be careful not to forget to unequip the box when it's not in use.

1625
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:37,650
To breathe.

1626
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:39,190
Wait, actually?

1627
01:47:39,710 --> 01:47:40,990
I can't breathe in this thing?

1628
01:47:43,610 --> 01:47:44,330
What's wrong?

1629
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:45,090
Uh-oh.

1630
01:47:45,530 --> 01:47:46,930
It looks like you've got company.

1631
01:47:47,090 --> 01:47:47,370
No!

1632
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:49,090
Watch out, Snake.

1633
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:53,910
That's the Tengu Advanced Defense Patrol Operations Lightning Espionage Unit.

1634
01:47:53,950 --> 01:47:55,090
Why is it so long?

1635
01:47:55,330 --> 01:47:56,750
Most people just call them the Tadpoles.

1636
01:47:56,810 --> 01:47:57,850
Oh, it's the Tadpoles!

1637
01:47:57,850 --> 01:48:05,350
Tadpoles are a highly specialized PNC group, notorious for their lightning-quick reflexes and unparalleled dexterity.

1638
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:07,430
Funny, they look just like little girls to me.

1639
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:09,710
Well, they are little girls.

1640
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:11,610
Ballerinas to be precise.

1641
01:48:12,190 --> 01:48:14,470
Why does this feel so Kids Next Door sometimes?

1642
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:15,730
Not that I can remember.

1643
01:48:16,090 --> 01:48:22,890
Believe me, these kids would give you an unforgettable performance of the Nutcracker, so you'd better not let them get too close.

1644
01:48:22,890 --> 01:48:30,190
The Tadpoles wear special Tadpro Stealth Suits, made from a synthetic semi-liquid material called Tadpolyester.

1645
01:48:30,830 --> 01:48:31,510
Tadpolyester!

1646
01:48:32,650 --> 01:48:37,950
The Tadpolyester acts as a lubricating agent, eliminating almost all friction between the joints.

1647
01:48:38,570 --> 01:48:40,670
This allows for total fluidity in motion.

1648
01:48:41,110 --> 01:48:44,330
Lubrication also prevents anyone from getting a firm grip on its surface.

1649
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:45,810
So no CQC.

1650
01:48:45,970 --> 01:48:46,290
Dang.

1651
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:46,850
No!

1652
01:48:46,850 --> 01:48:55,390
Like a ballet dance, every Tadpole's position is choreographed by a central controlling entity called the Level Designer.

1653
01:48:55,690 --> 01:48:59,810
These instructions are then communicated to each individual Tadpole via nanomachines.

1654
01:49:00,650 --> 01:49:02,630
Why do the children have nanomachines?

1655
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:06,330
To miss a mark could spell disaster for the rest of the team.

1656
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:12,570
That's why Tadpoles are injected with a blocker enzyme that prevents them from straying from the Level Designer's plan.

1657
01:49:12,930 --> 01:49:14,690
So distractions are out of the question.

1658
01:49:14,690 --> 01:49:15,210
OK.

1659
01:49:15,410 --> 01:49:18,690
I'd say your best bet is to sneak out of there using your cardboard box.

1660
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:19,050
OK.

1661
01:49:19,310 --> 01:49:22,810
Try to anticipate the Tadpole's movements and avoid being caught in their path.

1662
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:23,130
OK.

1663
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:27,470
With a little luck, you should be able to find a hole in their patrol path and sneak your way out.

1664
01:49:27,530 --> 01:49:27,810
OK.

1665
01:49:28,030 --> 01:49:28,350
Good luck.

1666
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:31,590
Oh no!

1667
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:32,810
They are also British!

1668
01:49:33,290 --> 01:49:35,890
He's gotta be the police O2 use.

1669
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:40,510
Oh no way.

1670
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:41,950
Cleo!

1671
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:49,360
Keep going.

1672
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:50,600
Keep going.

1673
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,920
Oh shoot.

1674
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:53,700
Oh my god.

1675
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,380
Uh-oh.

1676
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:08,380
Uh-oh.

1677
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:11,000
Go girl, go.

1678
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:11,920
Please leave.

1679
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:13,260
No!

1680
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:14,200
Please leave!

1681
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:16,340
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

1682
01:50:21,950 --> 01:50:22,590
OK.

1683
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:22,750
OK.

1684
01:50:25,530 --> 01:50:26,090
Understood.

1685
01:50:28,410 --> 01:50:30,070
OK, but I know where I can go.

1686
01:50:30,710 --> 01:50:31,750
I know I can go here.

1687
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:36,450
Oh Cleo!

1688
01:50:37,550 --> 01:50:38,530
Oh Cleo!

1689
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,340
OK, now I probably can box.

1690
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:48,220
Why can't I breathe in the cardboard box?

1691
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:50,000
Oh!

1692
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:01,420
Wait, how did I do that before?

1693
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:02,340
I don't remember.

1694
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:05,940
There's no air holes.

1695
01:51:06,220 --> 01:51:07,440
I know, but also...

1696
01:51:19,490 --> 01:51:20,030
Box.

1697
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:30,140
OK.

1698
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:33,220
OK.

1699
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:43,360
We can get through once she turns around and walks.

1700
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:45,880
Nice.

1701
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:48,660
And back to toast.

1702
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:50,220
Okey dokey.

1703
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:55,600
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

1704
01:51:57,260 --> 01:51:59,260
I think it's this one, right?

1705
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:01,540
Yeah.

1706
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:03,600
Okey dokey.

1707
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:04,680
Nice.

1708
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:08,680
Okey dokey.

1709
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:09,860
I'm just following.

1710
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:10,560
Where are we going?

1711
01:52:10,740 --> 01:52:12,860
OK, find an elevator to the first floor.

1712
01:52:12,860 --> 01:52:15,140
There's like...oh we're going this way now.

1713
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:17,080
Oh we can use our box here.

1714
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:19,760
That's so fun.

1715
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:23,700
Yeah!

1716
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:31,160
Gotcha!

1717
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:32,580
OK.

1718
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,560
Box and...

1719
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:37,700
No you don't.

1720
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:42,400
Nice.

1721
01:52:45,180 --> 01:52:46,300
Nice.

1722
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:47,360
Nice.

1723
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:49,900
Gotcha!

1724
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:51,540
East.

1725
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:54,680
OK, I'm going.

1726
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:58,480
Where are we?

1727
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:01,940
All the way down there.

1728
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:04,020
OK.

1729
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:07,660
I'm watching the children's movements.

1730
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:12,280
So...

1731
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:13,820
I just noticed.

1732
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:14,280
OK.

1733
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:16,880
I'm gonna become a deer.

1734
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:19,260
Oh deer.

1735
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:27,760
Oh and then they switch.

1736
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:28,480
OK OK.

1737
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:29,480
Good to know.

1738
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:38,980
And then they're gonna switch.

1739
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:40,680
I think.

1740
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:41,640
Yeah yeah yeah.

1741
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:42,060
OK.

1742
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:50,380
Nice.

1743
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:52,580
I'm just gonna run for it.

1744
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:55,200
What's over here?

1745
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:57,540
What's over here though?

1746
01:53:58,340 --> 01:53:59,100
Is there anything?

1747
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:00,500
Oh!

1748
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:01,340
They're looking!

1749
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,360
There's a present up there!

1750
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:07,640
CQC.

1751
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,360
I forgot I had it.

1752
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:16,780
Make checkpoint first.

1753
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:19,940
You are so smart, Revaldi!

1754
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:21,540
You are so smart.

1755
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:24,220
Nice.

1756
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:25,380
Now we got a checkpoint.

1757
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:29,240
And I'm gonna...

1758
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:31,260
Get my cane!

1759
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:33,580
Oh!

1760
01:54:34,740 --> 01:54:35,900
Sorry kid.

1761
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:43,420
I'm gonna grab this before they wake up.

1762
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:44,920
Oh we got another box!

1763
01:54:47,220 --> 01:54:47,780
Yes!

1764
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:52,080
Oh my god!

1765
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:52,860
It has an arrow!

1766
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:55,090
Oh.

1767
01:54:57,060 --> 01:54:58,120
Breathing hole.

1768
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:04,900
Yippee!

1769
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:10,860
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

1770
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:16,860
Oh.

1771
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:18,100
What?

1772
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,200
No, that's so messed up!

1773
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:21,400
I pressed CTRL!

1774
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:25,260
I pressed CTRL.

1775
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:27,880
NA equals...

1776
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:28,760
Wait, do I have it though?

1777
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:30,680
Why am I in the box?

1778
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:32,480
Wait, why am I in the box?

1779
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:33,700
Wait, I have it though!

1780
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:35,640
Oh!

1781
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:37,040
Nevermind.

1782
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:39,940
We don't need to go back at all.

1783
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:42,640
Okay.

1784
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:45,460
The game is forgiving.

1785
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:53,840
And so I'm going to switch to my box with air.

1786
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:02,580
I feel like there was a similar room in the first one.

1787
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:03,380
Like this.

1788
01:56:08,830 --> 01:56:09,350
Nice!

1789
01:56:10,910 --> 01:56:12,450
Where's the box for...

1790
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:14,950
Wait, where's the box with holes for sushi?

1791
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:15,670
What?

1792
01:56:17,850 --> 01:56:19,190
No, that's just craziness.

1793
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:22,850
That's like, too much, you know?

1794
01:56:24,250 --> 01:56:25,370
Yeah, there was one.

1795
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:26,790
Right, yeah, I thought so.

1796
01:56:29,630 --> 01:56:31,790
Oh, that kid scared me.

1797
01:56:38,220 --> 01:56:39,940
Is this not an elevator right here?

1798
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:51,160
I'm wall gliding.

1799
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:53,280
Can I go to the bathroom?

1800
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:53,840
No, okay.

1801
01:57:01,180 --> 01:57:02,800
Does this kid come up?

1802
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:03,180
No.

1803
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,940
I might... I might take him out though.

1804
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:19,900
Let's take him out.

1805
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:31,820
What is this?

1806
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:38,720
Oops.

1807
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,080
Oh my god.

1808
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:40,860
Oh my god.

1809
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:45,080
If I box...

1810
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:48,620
Does it help me sneak?

1811
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:50,060
Yes.

1812
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:52,120
A gift?

1813
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:01,460
Outer saving?

1814
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:02,840
Yeah, we are at the mall.

1815
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:02,980
Oh.

1816
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:09,260
The roof?

1817
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:18,620
Wait, seriously?

1818
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:28,280
Wait, where was the roof?

1819
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:28,560
Roof.

1820
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:34,180
Okay, we are just going to follow the yellow light.

1821
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:36,520
There we go.

1822
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:38,360
That was a close one.

1823
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:44,340
The top of the building, silly.

1824
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,860
Where was the top of the building?

1825
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,200
We are going to get this kid, we are going to knock him out, we are going to knock him dead.

1826
01:59:08,790 --> 01:59:09,630
Nothing?

1827
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:12,670
Just a box?

1828
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,320
You made a mistake, kid.

1829
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:28,400
I made a mistake, kid!

1830
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:35,680
It was me.

1831
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:37,780
I made the mistake.

1832
01:59:39,260 --> 01:59:39,800
No!

1833
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:50,600
I made the mistake.

1834
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:54,920
I

1835
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:05,250
don't know what this kid's pattern is, it kind of freaks me out.

1836
02:00:11,010 --> 02:00:14,550
I love being a box.

1837
02:00:16,890 --> 02:00:19,710
Mint made what Matara would call a mistaki.

1838
02:00:19,970 --> 02:00:22,350
Oh yeah, she does call it that, doesn't she?

1839
02:00:22,850 --> 02:00:23,730
She made a mistaki.

1840
02:00:23,730 --> 02:00:23,790
Mistaki?

1841
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:39,320
At least these kids aren't tough to get by, it's just a little, you know...

1842
02:00:40,620 --> 02:00:42,600
Okay, I'm following the line.

1843
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:44,320
Okay, I'm following...

1844
02:00:49,620 --> 02:00:51,760
Wait, oh no, I have to go back down!

1845
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:54,140
I don't think I can...

1846
02:00:54,140 --> 02:00:55,340
Yeah, this is a wall.

1847
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:56,500
Shoot.

1848
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:03,620
That's okay.

1849
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:06,340
We got the box.

1850
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:08,960
Oh no, they are going to hear.

1851
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:27,260
I just...

1852
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:30,060
Don't worry about it.

1853
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:32,900
Come here, kid.

1854
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:35,160
Come over this way.

1855
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,400
Actually, you can go up.

1856
02:01:42,570 --> 02:01:43,450
Here we go.

1857
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:57,060
What?

1858
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:11,710
How did they notice me?

1859
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:23,220
Oh my God.

1860
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:24,400
No!

1861
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:26,140
No!

1862
02:02:27,670 --> 02:02:27,950
No!

1863
02:02:28,330 --> 02:02:30,370
I won't let you find me this time.

1864
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:31,430
No!

1865
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:37,070
Surveillance camera.

1866
02:02:39,910 --> 02:02:40,590
Gotcha!

1867
02:02:43,230 --> 02:02:43,910
Gotcha!

1868
02:02:47,690 --> 02:02:48,370
Gotcha!

1869
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:59,120
I'm a box forever.

1870
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:02,220
I'm just a box.

1871
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:03,640
I'm a box forever, you guys.

1872
02:03:04,540 --> 02:03:08,140
Alright, we go all the way down and around...

1873
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:13,600
Oh yeah, there's no kids here still.

1874
02:03:14,240 --> 02:03:15,880
Okay, that's kind of not so bad then.

1875
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:18,420
They all left.

1876
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:24,160
Okay, I still have to get past this thing, but...

1877
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:25,760
I guess it could be worse.

1878
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:36,620
Makes me wish I hadn't done the backtracking before, you know?

1879
02:03:39,660 --> 02:03:42,820
Wait, is it going to be actual booties for my...

1880
02:03:42,820 --> 02:03:44,800
Like actual little socks for my booties?

1881
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:46,000
I wonder.

1882
02:03:48,460 --> 02:03:49,180
Hi, Mint.

1883
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:49,640
Hello!

1884
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:50,460
Hello, hello.

1885
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:58,760
I wonder if we're going to get to that room that I...

1886
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:14,960
The room that I was trying to get to before.

1887
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:17,520
Stockings, perhaps.

1888
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:17,800
Perhaps.

1889
02:04:20,940 --> 02:04:21,780
Stockings.

1890
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:28,280
Little sprite snake is so cute.

1891
02:04:35,890 --> 02:04:36,730
Let's see.

1892
02:04:38,850 --> 02:04:41,070
Oh, I hate this room though.

1893
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:44,170
My least favorite room.

1894
02:04:49,780 --> 02:04:50,720
Oh my god.

1895
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:53,500
He doesn't... No!

1896
02:04:57,380 --> 02:04:58,840
My least favorite room.

1897
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:03,340
They mimic the T-Rex.

1898
02:05:04,820 --> 02:05:06,460
He has pretty T-Rex, huh?

1899
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:12,460
Oh wait, actually I'm going to become a deer for this one.

1900
02:05:19,270 --> 02:05:19,750
Okay.

1901
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:24,510
Okay.

1902
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:25,430
Okay, we're good.

1903
02:05:27,110 --> 02:05:28,110
They're dumb kids.

1904
02:05:28,210 --> 02:05:28,910
They don't know anything.

1905
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:31,870
They don't know how to look over corners.

1906
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:38,110
No!

1907
02:05:39,550 --> 02:05:40,030
Hello?

1908
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:41,530
Are you going to move?

1909
02:05:41,690 --> 02:05:42,150
There we go.

1910
02:05:46,070 --> 02:05:47,690
I think I'm good here.

1911
02:05:50,910 --> 02:05:51,490
Alrighty.

1912
02:05:52,690 --> 02:05:54,670
Okay, where the heck are we?

1913
02:05:55,850 --> 02:05:57,130
Where are we?

1914
02:06:00,730 --> 02:06:01,990
There's this guy.

1915
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:05,850
Oh wait, this is where we can... This is where the item was before.

1916
02:06:06,510 --> 02:06:07,810
I remember now.

1917
02:06:23,290 --> 02:06:23,770
Wait.

1918
02:06:28,850 --> 02:06:29,330
Wait.

1919
02:06:29,950 --> 02:06:32,010
Wait, wait.

1920
02:06:32,650 --> 02:06:33,090
There we go.

1921
02:06:33,950 --> 02:06:35,090
And then I'm going to Nova Cannon.

1922
02:06:36,830 --> 02:06:38,750
This isn't the item he meant, right?

1923
02:06:39,430 --> 02:06:41,690
I guess I don't need to beat this guy, so...

1924
02:06:49,460 --> 02:06:49,940
Oops.

1925
02:06:50,860 --> 02:06:53,040
Merry Freaky Christmas Minky YouTube!

1926
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:56,000
I tried taking him out.

1927
02:06:56,440 --> 02:07:00,340
So you can't really take him out if you're like...

1928
02:07:00,940 --> 02:07:04,120
If you're like next to him, you know?

1929
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:29,560
I hate these kids.

1930
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:31,140
I hate these kids.

1931
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:34,540
I hope they all have coal in their stockings for the rest of their lives!

1932
02:07:34,540 --> 02:07:36,540
And their after lives!

1933
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:46,880
Why can't I walk in the mall?

1934
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:49,540
Am I not a citizen?

1935
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,220
Is this not a place?

1936
02:07:51,660 --> 02:07:51,940
Wait.

1937
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:52,420
Oh my god.

1938
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:53,200
What did you hear?

1939
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:54,500
What the hell did you hear?

1940
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:55,660
Excuse me?

1941
02:07:59,080 --> 02:07:59,520
What

1942
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:11,700
the hell did you hear?

1943
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:14,020
Did he see me?

1944
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,200
He didn't see me, did he?

1945
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:18,340
How did he see me so far away?

1946
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:24,500
If only I had taken that kid out, everything would have been fine!

1947
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:40,380
Okay.

1948
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:40,900
Alright.

1949
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:43,700
Oh my gosh.

1950
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:51,260
Take him out.

1951
02:08:53,460 --> 02:08:54,800
Okay, that guy's asleep.

1952
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:01,020
Now we'll take this guy out.

1953
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:04,540
He like goes all the way down to the bottom though.

1954
02:09:04,580 --> 02:09:05,140
I don't know why.

1955
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:08,620
Got him!

1956
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:11,200
Okay!

1957
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:12,480
H.I.

1958
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:19,420
We got it!

1959
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:31,320
Before that, I accidentally assassinated St. Nick.

1960
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:49,280
Holistic delusion.

1961
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:56,700
Stop with the nerd talk, Otacon.

1962
02:09:59,380 --> 02:09:59,860
Great,

1963
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:05,400
but how's this going to help with the mission?

1964
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:12,840
Okay.

1965
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:27,200
Well, when you put it that way.

1966
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:34,160
I'm so confused.

1967
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:44,680
That was a lot of talking for something so...

1968
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:45,660
Oh, this kid's awake again.

1969
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:47,660
Let's see.

1970
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:48,940
Box.

1971
02:10:52,360 --> 02:10:53,300
Oh god, he's awake!

1972
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:05,680
We're going over.

1973
02:11:05,680 --> 02:11:06,780
Oh shoot.

1974
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:08,640
You heard nothing?

1975
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:12,080
You heard nothing?

1976
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:13,700
Don't worry about it, kid.

1977
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:18,540
Oh, you're looking this way now?

1978
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:21,140
Don't worry about it, kid.

1979
02:11:23,580 --> 02:11:25,100
Don't worry about it, kid.

1980
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:32,720
These kids are too concerned with other people's issues.

1981
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:33,420
I'm just saying.

1982
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:35,860
It's not your issue.

1983
02:11:36,660 --> 02:11:37,740
You don't need to be concerned.

1984
02:11:38,740 --> 02:11:38,960
Okay?

1985
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:43,100
Gosh, we are really backtracking so far.

1986
02:11:44,540 --> 02:11:47,720
Oh my gosh, how much further do we need to go?

1987
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:49,680
Oh my gosh.

1988
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:57,280
Does he look up?

1989
02:12:04,680 --> 02:12:06,080
I think I go down?

1990
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:10,720
The gift includes fast travel too?

1991
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:12,260
Thank you.

1992
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:16,020
For the, I guess...

1993
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:22,700
Oh my god.

1994
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:26,020
Thank you for the heads up.

1995
02:12:34,890 --> 02:12:36,750
Oh, it's the other side.

1996
02:12:36,830 --> 02:12:37,410
Wait, what is it?

1997
02:12:37,470 --> 02:12:38,630
This is the bathroom, right?

1998
02:12:38,730 --> 02:12:39,790
Was there anything in here?

1999
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:49,720
Is there anything in here or is it just kids peeing?

2000
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:04,920
Men can't even go to the bathroom without getting caught.

2001
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:09,980
Wait, there is a special call.

2002
02:13:13,100 --> 02:13:13,700
No!

2003
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:15,860
No!

2004
02:13:18,160 --> 02:13:18,580
No!

2005
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:27,520
That's our reward.

2006
02:13:28,900 --> 02:13:30,180
That's our reward.

2007
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:41,210
It's horrible.

2008
02:13:48,810 --> 02:13:51,710
Okay, at least it's not so bad on the eyes, you know?

2009
02:13:56,570 --> 02:13:58,110
Did he wash his hands?

2010
02:13:58,190 --> 02:13:59,730
He absolutely did not.

2011
02:14:02,090 --> 02:14:02,770
Gotcha!

2012
02:14:06,710 --> 02:14:07,470
Oh yeah, that's right.

2013
02:14:07,530 --> 02:14:08,130
There is this kid.

2014
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:10,090
Gotcha!

2015
02:14:13,130 --> 02:14:13,530
Gotcha!

2016
02:14:15,670 --> 02:14:17,550
Oh yeah, there was these three kids too.

2017
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:24,080
Nice.

2018
02:14:25,620 --> 02:14:27,780
And then this guy who scared me in the beginning.

2019
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:30,380
Hope you had a good holiday, Mito.

2020
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:31,040
You too!

2021
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:31,900
Thanks, Brandon!

2022
02:14:31,900 --> 02:14:31,980
Brandon!

2023
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:40,760
Ping Pong!

2024
02:14:43,900 --> 02:14:44,380
Toast.

2025
02:14:47,380 --> 02:14:48,180
That's right.

2026
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:50,960
This kid is guarding this place pretty well.

2027
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:55,880
Oh, it's all the way over there.

2028
02:14:55,940 --> 02:14:56,520
I see it.

2029
02:15:00,620 --> 02:15:01,820
Oh, he didn't hear that.

2030
02:15:08,740 --> 02:15:09,140
Oops.

2031
02:15:13,390 --> 02:15:15,030
How am I supposed to get him to hear though?

2032
02:15:15,150 --> 02:15:15,990
He didn't hear it.

2033
02:15:22,290 --> 02:15:23,950
Maybe if I box here?

2034
02:15:25,530 --> 02:15:26,110
Let's see.

2035
02:15:26,290 --> 02:15:27,530
Maybe he will look in the corner.

2036
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:40,340
OK.

2037
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:41,280
Nice.

2038
02:15:46,060 --> 02:15:46,800
Oh, that's right.

2039
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:48,840
He just kind of turns around whenever he feels like.

2040
02:15:52,980 --> 02:15:54,120
I'm scared he's going to wake up.

2041
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:57,580
OK, I'm going.

2042
02:16:08,240 --> 02:16:08,980
I suck!

2043
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:12,660
What are you doing with the stocking-stocking again?

2044
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:15,620
The stocking-stocking is...

2045
02:16:15,620 --> 02:16:20,180
This was supposed to help me get past metal floors, but it's all ruined because of the eyeballs I made to wear it over my head.

2046
02:16:20,280 --> 02:16:23,320
Wait, you wore the stocking-stocking over your head?

2047
02:16:23,420 --> 02:16:24,280
Well, yeah.

2048
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:27,480
I mean, I figured I was supposed to wear it like a balaclava.

2049
02:16:27,720 --> 02:16:29,000
Oh, Snake, no!

2050
02:16:29,960 --> 02:16:30,800
You did it silly!

2051
02:16:30,820 --> 02:16:33,920
Yeah, but this was supposed to help me walk over metal floors without making any noise.

2052
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:37,360
Surely we could work backwards and figure out how we'd do such a thing.

2053
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:38,280
I get it.

2054
02:16:38,420 --> 02:16:40,460
Like six degrees of separation.

2055
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:40,940
Right.

2056
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:42,540
So this is a holy sock.

2057
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:45,080
What are some other holy things you know?

2058
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:46,200
Holy sock.

2059
02:16:46,580 --> 02:16:50,660
Foxholes, airholes, wormholes, plot holes.

2060
02:16:51,400 --> 02:16:51,940
Buttholes.

2061
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:52,780
This is no good.

2062
02:16:53,220 --> 02:16:54,660
Take a look at your other items.

2063
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:55,200
OK.

2064
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:57,680
Maybe there's a running theme going on.

2065
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:00,220
Well, a lot of my items are Christmassy.

2066
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:00,980
Great.

2067
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:04,560
So what are some Christmas things that are holy?

2068
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:05,580
Merry Christmas!

2069
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:07,460
Happy Boo Year!

2070
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:10,680
Thank you, Rika!

2071
02:17:14,260 --> 02:17:14,980
Oh, brother.

2072
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:23,300
Yippee!

2073
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:27,080
Oh, nice.

2074
02:17:28,420 --> 02:17:30,480
So where's the quick travel?

2075
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:35,180
We gotta go all the way back, huh?

2076
02:17:36,140 --> 02:17:37,560
Oh my god, that kid just woke up.

2077
02:17:38,380 --> 02:17:38,780
Oh my god.

2078
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:41,560
Nothing?

2079
02:17:42,040 --> 02:17:42,520
Just red.

2080
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:43,520
Just go snake.

2081
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:49,840
Alright, let's put on my sock.

2082
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:55,320
Oh my god, he's coming all the way over here!

2083
02:17:55,320 --> 02:17:55,960
Oh!

2084
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:01,220
So I think I...

2085
02:18:03,020 --> 02:18:05,100
I knocked here.

2086
02:18:08,180 --> 02:18:09,580
An emerald box.

2087
02:18:11,380 --> 02:18:12,060
There isn't.

2088
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:12,780
You misread.

2089
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:16,020
Wait, what do you mean I misread?

2090
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:19,980
Someone said that it comes with a fast...

2091
02:18:19,980 --> 02:18:22,500
The gift will be fast travel too.

2092
02:18:23,020 --> 02:18:25,480
Merry Christmas Mint.

2093
02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:26,560
Hope you're feeling better tonight.

2094
02:18:26,680 --> 02:18:27,320
Thank you!

2095
02:18:28,060 --> 02:18:29,840
Oh, they said I hope.

2096
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:47,380
I also hoped.

2097
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:52,060
I also hoped.

2098
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:54,100
Oh man.

2099
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:58,680
Gotcha!

2100
02:19:04,770 --> 02:19:05,370
Okay.

2101
02:19:09,450 --> 02:19:17,470
Maybe it won't be so bad since we have ways to knock kids out and also ways to get over floors and stuff now.

2102
02:19:19,790 --> 02:19:24,150
So maybe it won't be so long.

2103
02:19:25,110 --> 02:19:26,830
Where am I going again?

2104
02:19:27,930 --> 02:19:28,430
Like here?

2105
02:19:28,790 --> 02:19:29,610
Oh yeah, down there.

2106
02:19:31,090 --> 02:19:32,150
That was so close.

2107
02:19:33,150 --> 02:19:33,610
Phew!

2108
02:19:37,350 --> 02:19:39,030
Through here.

2109
02:19:51,130 --> 02:19:51,970
Okay.

2110
02:19:55,630 --> 02:19:57,570
We had hoped everybody.

2111
02:19:58,790 --> 02:20:03,490
Unfortunately, our dreams did not come true.

2112
02:20:04,030 --> 02:20:05,350
We did get an extra item.

2113
02:20:05,810 --> 02:20:06,670
That's kind of fun.

2114
02:20:06,670 --> 02:20:08,750
We got the Thermal Goggles.

2115
02:20:08,790 --> 02:20:10,770
Aren't you guys... That's like your favorite item.

2116
02:20:12,310 --> 02:20:14,930
We got the most important thing, right?

2117
02:20:17,070 --> 02:20:18,950
That's so important.

2118
02:20:27,630 --> 02:20:30,590
Christmas is saved!

2119
02:20:30,590 --> 02:20:31,690
Saved!

2120
02:20:41,900 --> 02:20:44,680
My favorite room!

2121
02:20:50,320 --> 02:20:51,720
Actually...

2122
02:20:55,250 --> 02:20:57,890
I think if I use the socks here...

2123
02:20:57,890 --> 02:20:58,530
Ah!

2124
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:02,130
Snake!

2125
02:21:08,050 --> 02:21:11,170
I'm so bad at avoiding this part.

2126
02:21:12,450 --> 02:21:14,150
Stinking children, man.

2127
02:21:14,290 --> 02:21:15,150
I swear to God.

2128
02:21:18,370 --> 02:21:19,650
What's going on?

2129
02:21:29,550 --> 02:21:30,170
Let's see.

2130
02:21:30,310 --> 02:21:30,990
Let's keep going.

2131
02:21:34,430 --> 02:21:35,910
I could have socked there.

2132
02:21:36,670 --> 02:21:38,770
There was a point I could have socked.

2133
02:21:41,830 --> 02:21:42,670
Okay, hold on.

2134
02:21:43,850 --> 02:21:45,190
It's like coming up.

2135
02:21:45,470 --> 02:21:46,770
They align perfectly.

2136
02:21:47,670 --> 02:21:48,250
I think here.

2137
02:21:51,570 --> 02:21:52,190
No.

2138
02:21:56,600 --> 02:21:57,160
No!

2139
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:07,840
We're almost back to where we were.

2140
02:22:09,480 --> 02:22:12,060
I think the next couple of parts don't have kids.

2141
02:22:12,060 --> 02:22:14,060
Well, besides like...

2142
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:18,040
Besides the kids at the bottom of the stairs, but we can just knock those kids out.

2143
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:25,780
I thought I heard my cat.

2144
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:28,540
I don't think I did.

2145
02:22:28,700 --> 02:22:31,300
We can just knock these kids out, baby!

2146
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:43,440
And then everything else should be...

2147
02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:45,440
With no kids.

2148
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:48,000
The double kill.

2149
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:49,860
Yeah, kill kids.

2150
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:55,440
He says don't stab them in the throat with the candy cane, but...

2151
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,420
It's the most effective weapon.

2152
02:22:57,900 --> 02:22:59,780
Or wait, it's the most effective way!

2153
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,880
I love these remixes of the...

2154
02:23:07,880 --> 02:23:09,500
Of the themes, they're so great.

2155
02:23:17,820 --> 02:23:19,720
It's only a mild concussion.

2156
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:21,740
Yeah, concussion.

2157
02:23:26,180 --> 02:23:26,740
Okay,

2158
02:23:30,100 --> 02:23:31,160
we're almost back guys.

2159
02:23:31,660 --> 02:23:32,720
We're almost there.

2160
02:23:37,060 --> 02:23:37,620
Gotcha!

2161
02:23:40,720 --> 02:23:41,280
Gotcha!

2162
02:23:43,940 --> 02:23:46,220
So glad we have the box with the air holes now.

2163
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:49,820
What was that one floor...

2164
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:53,820
Remember there was a floor with gas and...

2165
02:23:55,640 --> 02:23:56,940
What else was in there?

2166
02:23:57,640 --> 02:24:00,580
Gas and electrified floors and everything?

2167
02:24:00,860 --> 02:24:02,020
What happened to that place?

2168
02:24:12,030 --> 02:24:12,890
My socks.

2169
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:16,490
Now my box.

2170
02:24:23,660 --> 02:24:25,660
I don't think they...

2171
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:31,600
Alright.

2172
02:24:33,360 --> 02:24:34,620
And now my socks.

2173
02:24:36,520 --> 02:24:37,000
Nice.

2174
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:38,900
We're doing so good.

2175
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:39,700
We're doing it guys.

2176
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:40,420
We're doing it.

2177
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:42,400
And now...

2178
02:24:42,400 --> 02:24:44,880
I don't know if I need the box here, but I'd like to.

2179
02:24:47,860 --> 02:24:49,360
I think I do actually.

2180
02:24:53,720 --> 02:24:54,700
Otherwise they'll see me.

2181
02:24:55,080 --> 02:24:56,560
I touched him!

2182
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,120
Otherwise they'll see me in the peripheral.

2183
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:06,260
No socks.

2184
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:08,640
It's such an old man thing to wear.

2185
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:10,480
It's the socks, you know.

2186
02:25:12,420 --> 02:25:14,960
Having the socks is such an old man thing.

2187
02:25:25,700 --> 02:25:26,740
Compression socks.

2188
02:25:27,220 --> 02:25:30,340
Okay, so we gotta go all the way down there.

2189
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:32,220
We've got this.

2190
02:25:35,700 --> 02:25:37,040
We've got this.

2191
02:25:37,160 --> 02:25:40,260
Now we've got socks so we don't even have to be careful.

2192
02:25:41,220 --> 02:25:43,620
We can be reckless and wild.

2193
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:45,460
We can be unhinged.

2194
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:47,680
We can be...

2195
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:49,720
Crazy!

2196
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:52,600
And we can hit kids.

2197
02:25:57,320 --> 02:25:58,560
Like that.

2198
02:26:00,740 --> 02:26:02,260
Now we have our socks.

2199
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:11,140
Is this little punk?

2200
02:26:12,020 --> 02:26:12,420
Oh no.

2201
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:14,520
He's not doing anything.

2202
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:16,660
Wait, what's this?

2203
02:26:18,040 --> 02:26:19,320
A P-Gun?

2204
02:26:20,420 --> 02:26:22,560
We got the Polar Gun!

2205
02:26:32,280 --> 02:26:34,200
I love the Antarctic!

2206
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:35,560
Why are they in the Antarctic?

2207
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:41,720
Now that's what I'm talking about.

2208
02:26:45,560 --> 02:26:46,220
God,

2209
02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:05,700
these references are great.

2210
02:27:19,160 --> 02:27:21,840
Oh my god, that's insane.

2211
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:24,160
What's that?

2212
02:27:32,700 --> 02:27:34,700
They hibernate, don't they?

2213
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:41,660
And then they hibernated?

2214
02:27:42,460 --> 02:27:43,020
Oh no!

2215
02:27:45,740 --> 02:27:46,440
Oops.

2216
02:27:58,460 --> 02:27:59,860
Freaky.

2217
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:04,060
Okay.

2218
02:28:10,360 --> 02:28:11,200
Six shots.

2219
02:28:12,700 --> 02:28:13,120
Probably.

2220
02:28:14,460 --> 02:28:15,300
Yeah, probably.

2221
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:21,940
Oh, so my ammo is full.

2222
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:25,820
Guys, I got to go use the little ghosties room real quick.

2223
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:26,340
Is that okay?

2224
02:28:28,340 --> 02:28:29,040
Is that okay?

2225
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:29,720
I'm so sorry.

2226
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:31,380
It's about all this tea I've been drinking.

2227
02:28:32,720 --> 02:28:34,260
I'll be right back.

2228
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:40,280
You guys be good.

2229
02:28:42,100 --> 02:28:43,220
Wait, hold on.

2230
02:28:43,820 --> 02:28:45,400
We got to make this Christmas themed.

2231
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:48,420
Instead of gone fishing, what should we do for Christmas theme?

2232
02:28:55,080 --> 02:28:56,440
Gone Carolyn!

2233
02:28:58,040 --> 02:28:58,720
Carolyn.

2234
02:28:59,700 --> 02:29:00,880
Who's Carolyn?

2235
02:29:04,260 --> 02:29:05,380
Gone Carolyn.

2236
02:29:05,380 --> 02:29:10,120
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

2237
02:30:52,330 --> 02:30:53,070
I

2238
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:20,480
forgot to unmute.

2239
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:21,080
I'm back.

2240
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:26,580
There we go.

2241
02:31:26,860 --> 02:31:30,260
Alright guys, let's get back into it.

2242
02:31:42,940 --> 02:31:44,420
So we got our gun.

2243
02:31:46,600 --> 02:31:49,780
So now I can shoot the kids, which is very exciting.

2244
02:31:50,540 --> 02:31:52,700
And I'm excited to do that.

2245
02:31:54,080 --> 02:31:57,120
I'm going to shoot them till they freeze.

2246
02:31:57,960 --> 02:32:00,300
Where is our polar gun?

2247
02:32:04,930 --> 02:32:07,290
Wouldn't it be safer though to candy cane the kid?

2248
02:32:07,570 --> 02:32:07,970
I feel.

2249
02:32:08,970 --> 02:32:10,950
Wouldn't it be safer to candy kid though?

2250
02:32:11,370 --> 02:32:11,990
Candy kid.

2251
02:32:14,930 --> 02:32:16,950
We'll just use it when we need it.

2252
02:32:16,990 --> 02:32:18,550
Especially if we only have six shots.

2253
02:32:19,130 --> 02:32:20,090
Six shots.

2254
02:32:22,530 --> 02:32:23,770
Oh, you see me?

2255
02:32:24,070 --> 02:32:24,670
No you don't.

2256
02:32:25,650 --> 02:32:26,130
Liar.

2257
02:32:26,510 --> 02:32:27,290
This kid is a liar.

2258
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:32,620
What are you doing kid?

2259
02:32:33,540 --> 02:32:34,760
What are you looking around for?

2260
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:42,280
Trying to figure out where I go and what I do.

2261
02:32:42,280 --> 02:32:44,600
Oh gosh, someone else saw me.

2262
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:46,060
Oh my gosh.

2263
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:46,700
Okay, okay.

2264
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:48,080
I can't just sit here then.

2265
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:50,600
I have to be real sneaky.

2266
02:32:53,180 --> 02:32:53,700
Shoot.

2267
02:32:53,960 --> 02:32:54,480
Oh gosh.

2268
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:55,380
Nothing?

2269
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:03,920
Yup, exactly.

2270
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:04,820
Dummy kid.

2271
02:33:06,020 --> 02:33:08,300
We got to go down, but...

2272
02:33:09,620 --> 02:33:10,140
Okay.

2273
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:11,600
CQC him.

2274
02:33:12,080 --> 02:33:13,580
I don't know what's patterned yet though.

2275
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:18,520
Oh

2276
02:33:22,480 --> 02:33:24,400
my god, that scared me!

2277
02:33:25,140 --> 02:33:27,260
Oh my gosh.

2278
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:30,460
That was so Hueycore.

2279
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:31,440
What do you mean by that?

2280
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:33,240
What do you mean by that?

2281
02:33:35,360 --> 02:33:36,640
Holy moly.

2282
02:33:37,980 --> 02:33:39,380
Holy night.

2283
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:42,660
He turns around so fast, this kid.

2284
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:45,240
Okay,

2285
02:33:52,320 --> 02:33:53,720
and then he looks back.

2286
02:33:56,740 --> 02:33:59,440
Alright, we'll wait for him to walk over.

2287
02:34:04,190 --> 02:34:06,250
Oh gosh, we need our socks here.

2288
02:34:07,070 --> 02:34:08,110
We need our socks here.

2289
02:34:13,330 --> 02:34:14,670
Alright, sock.

2290
02:34:16,990 --> 02:34:18,290
And sock again.

2291
02:34:19,450 --> 02:34:21,230
How do I want to do this?

2292
02:34:23,770 --> 02:34:24,670
Maybe I...

2293
02:34:28,410 --> 02:34:31,030
Well, if I do it, will one see me?

2294
02:34:31,170 --> 02:34:31,490
I wonder.

2295
02:34:33,310 --> 02:34:38,270
Like if I go down, I mean, and CQC the kid, the other kid will see me.

2296
02:34:38,650 --> 02:34:39,150
Probably.

2297
02:34:39,970 --> 02:34:45,030
So I should knock here and then run over here and box.

2298
02:34:48,450 --> 02:34:49,930
I hate this kid!

2299
02:34:50,210 --> 02:34:51,210
I hate you!

2300
02:34:51,550 --> 02:34:52,410
What the hell kid?

2301
02:34:52,630 --> 02:34:55,530
Why don't you do exactly as I predict you to do?

2302
02:34:55,530 --> 02:34:57,110
Why don't you listen to me?

2303
02:34:57,790 --> 02:34:59,070
Listen to your father!

2304
02:34:59,710 --> 02:35:00,750
Stupid ass kid.

2305
02:35:01,450 --> 02:35:02,750
Stupid kid.

2306
02:35:04,490 --> 02:35:05,790
Stupid kid.

2307
02:35:13,530 --> 02:35:14,790
Stupid kid.

2308
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:24,400
We are following after this kid.

2309
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:27,260
Oh my chat is frozen.

2310
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:28,400
Give me a second.

2311
02:35:32,300 --> 02:35:34,040
How do you pause in this game?

2312
02:35:34,620 --> 02:35:36,100
Besides just holding down.

2313
02:35:36,580 --> 02:35:37,860
How do you pause in this game?

2314
02:35:38,160 --> 02:35:39,580
I don't know actually.

2315
02:35:47,960 --> 02:35:51,000
Well that is why I need to learn how to pause.

2316
02:35:52,380 --> 02:35:52,920
Codec?

2317
02:35:53,620 --> 02:35:54,740
Probably, right?

2318
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:57,560
Probably, probably, probably.

2319
02:35:57,560 --> 02:35:58,380
Okay, hold on.

2320
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:00,320
I'm...

2321
02:36:04,100 --> 02:36:05,780
Just finished the new levels of Freak or Treat.

2322
02:36:05,880 --> 02:36:07,420
The new cameos and references are great.

2323
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:09,000
You've really been spoiling us.

2324
02:36:09,080 --> 02:36:10,160
Hope your tummy feels better soon.

2325
02:36:10,220 --> 02:36:10,920
Hope you have a good holiday.

2326
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:12,320
Thank you Brick!

2327
02:36:12,360 --> 02:36:14,060
I'm glad you liked it!

2328
02:36:15,660 --> 02:36:17,480
Oh, thank you for reminding me.

2329
02:36:17,540 --> 02:36:18,060
Oh my gosh.

2330
02:36:18,220 --> 02:36:19,540
Hold on, I was fixing my chat.

2331
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:19,900
There we go.

2332
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:27,360
For those who don't know, I have a game that I have out called Freak or Treat.

2333
02:36:27,740 --> 02:36:31,440
I made it, well I didn't make it, but you know, me and my team.

2334
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:33,320
We did it for Halloween.

2335
02:36:36,220 --> 02:36:39,580
We recently added 12 new levels.

2336
02:36:40,340 --> 02:36:41,900
So lots and lots of levels.

2337
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:46,660
I should add it to my description.

2338
02:36:47,140 --> 02:36:48,040
Now that I think about it.

2339
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:51,200
I hate this kid.

2340
02:36:51,740 --> 02:36:54,080
I can't believe he saw me from so far away.

2341
02:36:54,580 --> 02:36:55,600
Eagle-eyed punk.

2342
02:36:56,080 --> 02:36:59,240
I'm gonna make sure you have... Next time you're not gonna have eyes.

2343
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:00,340
Little asshole.

2344
02:37:02,300 --> 02:37:04,180
How do I wanna do this?

2345
02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:07,280
I

2346
02:37:12,780 --> 02:37:14,560
don't know where to knock.

2347
02:37:25,310 --> 02:37:27,410
Use the metal floor for a more safe distraction?

2348
02:37:27,410 --> 02:37:29,230
You're so right.

2349
02:37:33,530 --> 02:37:34,270
Don't.

2350
02:37:34,350 --> 02:37:34,910
Don't do it.

2351
02:37:38,950 --> 02:37:39,690
No.

2352
02:37:42,250 --> 02:37:42,810
Oh god.

2353
02:37:44,170 --> 02:37:46,470
Oh my gosh, that was so close.

2354
02:37:55,510 --> 02:37:57,110
We made it.

2355
02:37:58,770 --> 02:38:00,190
Too good at this game.

2356
02:38:02,990 --> 02:38:03,690
Merry Christmas.

2357
02:38:04,010 --> 02:38:07,350
Thank you for spending Christmas, a romantic holiday in Japan with us, your Wisps.

2358
02:38:07,630 --> 02:38:08,810
Does that mean you love us?

2359
02:38:10,090 --> 02:38:11,570
Does it look like I'm in Japan, Brian?

2360
02:38:15,010 --> 02:38:16,430
Are you in Japan, Brian?

2361
02:38:27,390 --> 02:38:28,250
That's what I thought.

2362
02:38:29,370 --> 02:38:31,790
Alright, where... Oh gosh, we need to go all the way down there.

2363
02:38:31,930 --> 02:38:32,210
Alright,

2364
02:38:37,700 --> 02:38:38,320
let's suck.

2365
02:38:42,640 --> 02:38:43,040
And...

2366
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:44,700
I ran into him instead.

2367
02:38:50,820 --> 02:38:52,760
I'm in Japan, so it's very romantic.

2368
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:53,880
I'm sorry for you.

2369
02:38:54,940 --> 02:38:56,520
I'm so sorry for you.

2370
02:39:04,700 --> 02:39:06,000
I didn't think he'd see me.

2371
02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:10,720
First he sucked across the floor, then he sucked the kid.

2372
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:11,680
Yeah, exactly.

2373
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:17,040
Except I didn't realize he'd be able to see me.

2374
02:39:18,740 --> 02:39:22,200
Didn't realize he'd be able to see me.

2375
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:25,740
Right there.

2376
02:39:28,340 --> 02:39:30,320
Actually, maybe we don't have to suck him.

2377
02:39:32,480 --> 02:39:33,920
Maybe I can just do this.

2378
02:39:35,800 --> 02:39:36,360
Okay, bye!

2379
02:39:52,880 --> 02:39:54,040
Yeah, exactly.

2380
02:39:54,580 --> 02:39:56,520
Go investigate, silly kid.

2381
02:39:59,820 --> 02:40:01,640
Oh my god!

2382
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:06,060
I didn't think it would see me.

2383
02:40:07,540 --> 02:40:07,960
What?

2384
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:10,200
That was craziness.

2385
02:40:16,740 --> 02:40:19,340
It's okay, we can get back pretty quickly.

2386
02:40:24,980 --> 02:40:27,420
I'm afraid of going...

2387
02:40:28,680 --> 02:40:29,380
Oh wait.

2388
02:40:29,700 --> 02:40:30,240
Oh my god.

2389
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:32,100
I'm afraid of when to go.

2390
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:36,240
Um...

2391
02:40:38,090 --> 02:40:40,630
Okay, I see my window of opportunity.

2392
02:40:41,250 --> 02:40:41,530
Here.

2393
02:40:42,870 --> 02:40:44,870
Oh, but I... Okay, okay, okay.

2394
02:40:45,850 --> 02:40:46,630
Alright, alright.

2395
02:40:47,650 --> 02:40:49,230
We have to...

2396
02:40:49,230 --> 02:40:50,510
Oh, it's tricky.

2397
02:41:06,090 --> 02:41:07,170
What does this kid do?

2398
02:41:08,150 --> 02:41:08,510
Nothing?

2399
02:41:08,890 --> 02:41:09,750
You just stand here?

2400
02:41:10,190 --> 02:41:10,990
You just be a kid?

2401
02:41:11,850 --> 02:41:13,310
You just be a little weirdo kid?

2402
02:41:15,010 --> 02:41:15,450
Yeah.

2403
02:41:19,240 --> 02:41:21,080
Actually, I'm gonna be a deer here.

2404
02:41:30,240 --> 02:41:30,680
Mike!

2405
02:41:30,760 --> 02:41:32,360
Thank you so much for the pink!

2406
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,340
I mean, don't marry Xmas.

2407
02:41:35,440 --> 02:41:37,280
I heard that you're such a hag...

2408
02:41:38,580 --> 02:41:43,120
that in the bible's version of a Christmas carol, you were the ghost of Christmas past to Jesus Christ himself.

2409
02:42:10,640 --> 02:42:12,380
This elevator is busted too.

2410
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:14,880
I'm all out of ideas, Snake.

2411
02:42:17,180 --> 02:42:19,680
Why is every single elevator in this mall broken?

2412
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:24,180
What's up with this place?

2413
02:42:37,790 --> 02:42:38,490
What's this?

2414
02:42:39,370 --> 02:42:40,590
Hey man, can you please keep it down?

2415
02:42:40,630 --> 02:42:41,430
I'm trying to sleep.

2416
02:42:46,210 --> 02:42:47,090
Then leave!

2417
02:42:47,090 --> 02:42:47,170
Leave!

2418
02:42:50,750 --> 02:42:52,870
The Nova Kid is in your right hand.

2419
02:42:52,950 --> 02:42:55,050
Why are you punching them with your left chest?

2420
02:42:56,030 --> 02:42:57,590
Oh my god, we just got a missile?

2421
02:43:00,930 --> 02:43:05,950
Wait, can I actually blow up the kids now?

2422
02:43:10,950 --> 02:43:11,390
Hello?

2423
02:43:13,490 --> 02:43:14,090
Hello?

2424
02:43:34,310 --> 02:43:37,510
I don't think I want to kiss the children, Otacon.

2425
02:43:41,390 --> 02:43:43,790
Which you can then control with your arrow keys.

2426
02:43:44,230 --> 02:43:44,630
Kissels?

2427
02:43:45,170 --> 02:43:46,050
Missile Toe Launcher?

2428
02:43:46,490 --> 02:43:47,310
This is ridiculous.

2429
02:43:47,730 --> 02:43:49,470
Why should I believe a single thing you've said?

2430
02:43:49,510 --> 02:43:52,770
Well, because if you don't, you'll end up blowing up a lot of them.

2431
02:43:52,770 --> 02:43:53,930
Alright, alright, I believe you.

2432
02:43:54,450 --> 02:43:55,590
One last thing.

2433
02:43:56,130 --> 02:43:59,230
The Missile Toe Launcher can only hold one kissel at a time.

2434
02:43:59,470 --> 02:44:03,010
So once you fire it, you'll have to find more kissels around the mall.

2435
02:44:05,090 --> 02:44:06,950
What am I supposed to do with this?

2436
02:44:06,950 --> 02:44:11,550
With that Missile Toe Launcher, you should be able to destroy the electrical switchboard.

2437
02:44:12,390 --> 02:44:14,750
It's in that room filled with gas.

2438
02:44:14,770 --> 02:44:15,850
Oh god, where was that?

2439
02:44:15,930 --> 02:44:21,750
By destroying the electrical switchboard, you deactivate all the electrical floors in that area.

2440
02:44:22,910 --> 02:44:25,290
You should head back up to the 20th floor.

2441
02:44:25,730 --> 02:44:29,630
From there, you can access an elevator that will take you down to the 10th floor.

2442
02:44:29,850 --> 02:44:30,990
What's on the 10th floor?

2443
02:44:30,990 --> 02:44:33,910
An elevator you can take all the way down to the...

2444
02:44:33,910 --> 02:44:35,110
If I miss...

2445
02:44:36,230 --> 02:44:39,050
If I miss, I have to come all the way back here for ammo?

2446
02:44:55,980 --> 02:44:56,460
No.

2447
02:44:56,460 --> 02:44:57,540
No way.

2448
02:45:01,740 --> 02:45:03,040
Just don't miss.

2449
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:06,600
Some people are saying it's any ammo.

2450
02:45:07,300 --> 02:45:10,680
So like if I just find something like random ammo around...

2451
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:13,720
Wait, I have to go all the way back though?

2452
02:45:13,820 --> 02:45:17,680
Wait, there's only like one ammo that I've seen and all like...

2453
02:45:19,480 --> 02:45:21,100
Wait, how am I supposed to get this kid?

2454
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:31,580
Oh, I guess like... Hold on.

2455
02:45:41,900 --> 02:45:43,720
When he walks back, I'll kill him.

2456
02:45:44,680 --> 02:45:45,660
Not kill him, sorry.

2457
02:46:02,690 --> 02:46:03,990
I'm not killing kids.

2458
02:46:03,990 --> 02:46:05,190
Yeah, don't...

2459
02:46:06,350 --> 02:46:07,470
Don't worry.

2460
02:46:09,370 --> 02:46:10,150
That was close.

2461
02:46:20,450 --> 02:46:27,860
Can I get this guy?

2462
02:46:28,900 --> 02:46:30,800
No, I'm not gonna be...

2463
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:33,520
How do I want to get this guy?

2464
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:35,100
You know what?

2465
02:46:35,100 --> 02:46:35,620
I'm gonna try.

2466
02:46:36,520 --> 02:46:38,300
Oh, fuck me!

2467
02:46:40,160 --> 02:46:42,740
You fucking kids, where are your parents?

2468
02:46:49,710 --> 02:46:50,570
I hate the children.

2469
02:46:51,390 --> 02:46:52,350
I hate the children.

2470
02:46:58,210 --> 02:46:59,590
Oh wait, I did it wrong.

2471
02:46:59,730 --> 02:47:00,210
I'm an idiot.

2472
02:47:00,430 --> 02:47:01,910
Sorry, I just realized.

2473
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:08,420
I'm the shifty deer.

2474
02:47:08,760 --> 02:47:09,960
I'm the shifty deer.

2475
02:47:10,420 --> 02:47:11,520
I'm the shifty deer.

2476
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:13,180
I'm the shifty deer.

2477
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:18,620
Hey, hey, don't go close to the wall.

2478
02:47:19,900 --> 02:47:20,980
Stupid kid.

2479
02:47:29,330 --> 02:47:32,430
I'm the shifty deer.

2480
02:47:33,010 --> 02:47:38,670
I'm gonna get shifted every year.

2481
02:47:39,470 --> 02:47:40,450
Stupid kid.

2482
02:47:41,010 --> 02:47:42,070
Stupid kid.

2483
02:47:45,650 --> 02:47:48,150
No guilt is harm...

2484
02:47:48,690 --> 02:47:49,830
Turn around!

2485
02:47:50,570 --> 02:47:51,690
Oh, don't go up.

2486
02:47:51,810 --> 02:47:52,250
Okay, nevermind.

2487
02:47:52,330 --> 02:47:52,650
You know what?

2488
02:47:52,690 --> 02:47:54,870
I don't know why I didn't just sneak past you before.

2489
02:47:54,870 --> 02:47:57,350
The novocade is in your right hand.

2490
02:47:57,550 --> 02:47:57,810
Stop!

2491
02:48:00,610 --> 02:48:02,690
This section is so annoying.

2492
02:48:17,940 --> 02:48:20,880
So let's try kissing these kids.

2493
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:22,480
With the missile.

2494
02:48:23,380 --> 02:48:25,760
Let's try firing a missile at them.

2495
02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:28,420
Hit the target out with the power of love.

2496
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:32,460
Hold down ctrl to look down the sights and release the fire.

2497
02:48:38,520 --> 02:48:40,380
Wow, it's really shaky.

2498
02:48:58,640 --> 02:48:59,780
I'm so dead.

2499
02:49:05,500 --> 02:49:07,060
I'm so dead.

2500
02:49:13,020 --> 02:49:15,080
Sneak 100.

2501
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:23,520
No way.

2502
02:49:42,710 --> 02:49:44,280
Oh my goodness gracious.

2503
02:49:45,160 --> 02:49:45,840
Scary.

2504
02:49:47,660 --> 02:49:49,130
Okay, all the way...

2505
02:49:49,360 --> 02:49:50,880
All the way back.

2506
02:49:50,880 --> 02:49:54,140
No wonder this game has such a much longer run time.

2507
02:49:57,060 --> 02:49:59,280
Don't question where the box came from.

2508
02:49:59,380 --> 02:50:01,600
Wait, how the hell am I supposed to get past these kids?

2509
02:50:03,080 --> 02:50:05,620
Can I not take this up here?

2510
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:21,640
Shoot it with the kissel.

2511
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:23,840
Do I shoot it?

2512
02:50:30,740 --> 02:50:34,480
I'm just trying to exist here.

2513
02:50:35,420 --> 02:50:37,720
I'm just trying to exist here.

2514
02:50:41,420 --> 02:50:42,260
No.

2515
02:50:42,840 --> 02:50:43,100
No!

2516
02:50:44,540 --> 02:50:45,900
This kid!

2517
02:50:53,540 --> 02:50:56,720
I'm hoping this reloads every time.

2518
02:50:56,720 --> 02:50:58,620
Is this a...

2519
02:50:58,620 --> 02:51:01,860
Oh my gosh, this is... It shoots so fast.

2520
02:51:02,200 --> 02:51:04,420
You guys, it shoots so fast.

2521
02:51:04,480 --> 02:51:05,600
Is that the electrical board?

2522
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:06,440
I don't even know.

2523
02:51:08,220 --> 02:51:09,300
Oh my god.

2524
02:51:09,540 --> 02:51:10,500
Oh my god.

2525
02:51:12,860 --> 02:51:14,900
Oh, it's so fast.

2526
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:19,680
I don't know if that's the electrical board right there.

2527
02:51:20,500 --> 02:51:23,060
This kid, I'm gonna murder you for real.

2528
02:51:37,180 --> 02:51:39,320
How do I wanna be...

2529
02:51:41,360 --> 02:51:42,680
Where do I want to be?

2530
02:51:43,120 --> 02:51:44,120
I think it's that.

2531
02:51:47,580 --> 02:51:48,380
Maybe here.

2532
02:51:49,160 --> 02:51:49,620
It's okay.

2533
02:51:53,300 --> 02:51:56,640
Then I still have to... If I run out of ammo, it's such a pain in the butt.

2534
02:51:56,740 --> 02:51:57,380
That's a vent?

2535
02:51:57,580 --> 02:51:58,180
It is?

2536
02:51:58,180 --> 02:51:58,860
It's a...

2537
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:05,260
It looks like a vent, but it's like...

2538
02:52:06,280 --> 02:52:06,800
Oopsie.

2539
02:52:08,040 --> 02:52:09,320
Okay, a box.

2540
02:52:16,860 --> 02:52:21,920
I have to go all the way to the room with the cats to get rid of all the electric boards.

2541
02:52:29,470 --> 02:52:29,990
Okay.

2542
02:52:29,990 --> 02:52:30,310
Okay.

2543
02:52:32,370 --> 02:52:35,070
How do I get past these kids?

2544
02:52:36,210 --> 02:52:37,290
Ugly kids.

2545
02:52:38,150 --> 02:52:39,170
Oh god.

2546
02:52:41,390 --> 02:52:44,270
I'm trying to figure out how I get past these two right here.

2547
02:52:51,890 --> 02:52:52,930
Knock him out.

2548
02:52:53,010 --> 02:52:54,030
Yeah, I think I need to.

2549
02:53:11,580 --> 02:53:13,520
I'm pressing control, but it...

2550
02:53:14,120 --> 02:53:14,960
There we go.

2551
02:53:14,960 --> 02:53:17,780
Wait, I think he's gonna come down through here, isn't he?

2552
02:53:27,380 --> 02:53:35,880
I hate this stupid ass kid.

2553
02:53:40,240 --> 02:53:41,900
I can't wait to murder you.

2554
02:53:44,220 --> 02:53:46,720
This will be your last Christmas.

2555
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:48,960
It's your last Christmas.

2556
02:53:48,960 --> 02:53:53,640
It's your last Christmas and it's your very last Christmas.

2557
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:55,680
Say goodb... wait.

2558
02:53:55,860 --> 02:53:58,640
I didn't get both kids!

2559
02:54:02,600 --> 02:54:03,280
Actually,

2560
02:54:16,940 --> 02:54:18,360
I'm just gonna hang out right here.

2561
02:54:22,680 --> 02:54:23,600
Where is it?

2562
02:54:23,700 --> 02:54:23,840
Here.

2563
02:54:30,310 --> 02:54:32,010
Okay, now we got both of them.

2564
02:54:32,690 --> 02:54:33,390
Okay.

2565
02:54:35,010 --> 02:54:35,770
Goodness.

2566
02:54:36,530 --> 02:54:37,230
Thank goodness.

2567
02:54:38,530 --> 02:54:39,650
Thank goodness.

2568
02:54:44,720 --> 02:54:47,520
Stop it!

2569
02:54:54,320 --> 02:54:56,200
We can't do this anymore.

2570
02:54:56,400 --> 02:54:57,380
I'm so...

2571
02:54:57,380 --> 02:55:01,700
This part is so frustrating!

2572
02:55:01,700 --> 02:55:02,580
Frustrating!

2573
02:55:10,160 --> 02:55:13,560
I got a box right here.

2574
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:16,940
Oh my god.

2575
02:55:34,030 --> 02:55:35,630
Real Joker moment.

2576
02:55:36,490 --> 02:55:38,110
Joker moment real.

2577
02:55:38,470 --> 02:55:39,970
Real Joker moment.

2578
02:55:40,550 --> 02:55:42,070
Real Joker moment!

2579
02:55:42,870 --> 02:55:43,950
Joker moment!

2580
02:55:44,550 --> 02:55:45,330
I'm gonna become the Joker!

2581
02:55:45,470 --> 02:55:46,310
I'm gonna become the Joker!

2582
02:55:47,930 --> 02:55:49,850
He walks on the tiles, right?

2583
02:55:49,930 --> 02:55:50,350
Okay, yeah.

2584
02:55:58,230 --> 02:56:00,690
Why not use the... shit.

2585
02:56:01,090 --> 02:56:03,110
Shit shit shit shit shit shit shit.

2586
02:56:04,350 --> 02:56:05,690
He's not coming down here, right?

2587
02:56:05,770 --> 02:56:06,150
Okay, good.

2588
02:56:11,790 --> 02:56:15,450
This guy is really hard because he moves so fast.

2589
02:56:15,490 --> 02:56:16,290
This one over here.

2590
02:56:18,310 --> 02:56:20,510
I'm trying to figure out how I wanna deal with him.

2591
02:56:21,430 --> 02:56:22,390
I could... You know what?

2592
02:56:22,390 --> 02:56:24,110
I think I'll have to Nikita Missile him.

2593
02:56:25,230 --> 02:56:27,030
Once this guy walks past.

2594
02:56:28,730 --> 02:56:29,370
Okay.

2595
02:56:31,490 --> 02:56:32,130
Missile.

2596
02:56:34,550 --> 02:56:35,190
N!

2597
02:57:38,270 --> 02:57:40,210
You stinking ugly children!

2598
02:57:42,970 --> 02:57:43,610
God!

2599
02:57:43,770 --> 02:57:45,650
Wait, do I have...

2600
02:57:45,650 --> 02:57:46,290
Okay, good.

2601
02:57:46,510 --> 02:57:49,130
I still have the one missile that they give me.

2602
02:57:49,550 --> 02:57:52,770
The singular missile that they give me.

2603
02:57:52,770 --> 02:57:56,050
What's up with this kid chilling over here anyway?

2604
02:58:01,230 --> 02:58:02,950
Oh my god!

2605
02:58:04,050 --> 02:58:04,650
Okay.

2606
02:58:05,790 --> 02:58:06,390
Alright.

2607
02:58:08,250 --> 02:58:10,370
And then... Wait, not the sock.

2608
02:58:10,490 --> 02:58:11,530
Sorry, not yet.

2609
02:58:17,400 --> 02:58:18,620
He's on break.

2610
02:58:19,460 --> 02:58:21,080
I guess that's... I guess that's fair.

2611
02:58:24,040 --> 02:58:27,420
I'm all for any kids that don't bother me.

2612
02:58:28,220 --> 02:58:30,440
This game is gonna make me the Grinch.

2613
02:58:34,360 --> 02:58:35,340
We're fine.

2614
02:58:38,300 --> 02:58:41,900
Oh my god.

2615
02:58:42,020 --> 02:58:44,140
I'm stuck trying to get past the wall.

2616
02:58:44,620 --> 02:58:50,870
That was so close.

2617
02:58:57,860 --> 02:58:58,360
Yeah!

2618
02:59:01,920 --> 02:59:04,680
Okay, now we go...

2619
02:59:04,680 --> 02:59:05,780
Oh look!

2620
02:59:05,880 --> 02:59:08,020
Wait, were these ammos here before?

2621
02:59:08,540 --> 02:59:09,900
Or are these all new?

2622
02:59:10,360 --> 02:59:11,180
I think actually.

2623
02:59:12,280 --> 02:59:14,120
I think these are all new.

2624
02:59:14,380 --> 02:59:15,100
I think.

2625
02:59:16,240 --> 02:59:17,360
Yeah, I think.

2626
02:59:18,300 --> 02:59:19,440
So that's kind of nice.

2627
02:59:19,620 --> 02:59:20,660
Ever since he got the gun.

2628
02:59:27,830 --> 02:59:28,650
I'm sock.

2629
02:59:28,870 --> 02:59:29,530
I'm socks.

2630
02:59:29,530 --> 02:59:30,650
Socks.

2631
02:59:31,110 --> 02:59:31,570
Socks.

2632
02:59:31,570 --> 02:59:32,270
Socks.

2633
02:59:37,460 --> 02:59:38,440
Nice.

2634
02:59:39,340 --> 02:59:40,740
Nice.

2635
02:59:41,780 --> 02:59:42,500
Oh shit.

2636
02:59:43,980 --> 02:59:44,340
Nothing?

2637
02:59:46,240 --> 02:59:47,080
Please.

2638
02:59:47,360 --> 02:59:47,740
Thank you.

2639
02:59:50,820 --> 02:59:54,200
Oh look, there's one here.

2640
02:59:57,720 --> 02:59:58,440
Gotcha.

2641
02:59:59,800 --> 03:00:01,200
Gotcha.

2642
03:00:01,200 --> 03:00:04,040
I think that's electrified floors too.

2643
03:00:05,900 --> 03:00:08,900
If I'm looking at those correctly.

2644
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:10,480
Okay.

2645
03:00:11,800 --> 03:00:13,780
We're past that part.

2646
03:00:14,600 --> 03:00:15,840
Holy moly.

2647
03:00:17,880 --> 03:00:20,620
Okay, well, just why not still be a box.

2648
03:00:20,740 --> 03:00:23,480
There's no bad part of being a box, eh?

2649
03:00:23,900 --> 03:00:27,600
We're just boxin' along, boxin' along, boxin' along.

2650
03:00:28,340 --> 03:00:29,820
There's no kids here.

2651
03:00:29,900 --> 03:00:31,000
It's pretty nice.

2652
03:00:31,500 --> 03:00:37,180
I love adult-free or kid-free places, you know.

2653
03:00:37,400 --> 03:00:40,120
When they're like, no kids allowed at this resort.

2654
03:00:43,360 --> 03:00:45,320
That's how I feel this area is.

2655
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:46,540
It's so nice.

2656
03:00:47,220 --> 03:00:48,420
Boxing day is tomorrow.

2657
03:00:48,740 --> 03:00:49,780
Oh my gosh, wait, you're right.

2658
03:00:54,260 --> 03:00:54,680
Okay.

2659
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:58,280
But man, thanks very much.

2660
03:00:59,820 --> 03:01:03,160
Memories broken, the truth goes unspoken.

2661
03:01:03,400 --> 03:01:06,120
I've even forgotten my name.

2662
03:01:06,920 --> 03:01:08,700
Wait, what's my name?

2663
03:01:09,120 --> 03:01:09,860
Oh no!

2664
03:01:22,020 --> 03:01:23,240
What was that?

2665
03:01:27,450 --> 03:01:28,610
What was that?

2666
03:01:32,340 --> 03:01:33,680
What was that?

2667
03:01:35,260 --> 03:01:36,700
I miss Sam.

2668
03:01:36,700 --> 03:01:37,060
I miss him.

2669
03:01:39,780 --> 03:01:41,300
I miss him so much.

2670
03:01:50,420 --> 03:01:51,360
Ammo full.

2671
03:01:51,760 --> 03:01:53,040
At least they give you ammo now.

2672
03:01:53,140 --> 03:01:53,760
It's so nice.

2673
03:01:56,060 --> 03:01:58,200
It's my favorite spot!

2674
03:01:59,380 --> 03:02:01,180
You guys, it's my favorite area!

2675
03:02:01,320 --> 03:02:01,940
It's my favorite area!

2676
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:02,780
It's my favorite area!

2677
03:02:02,920 --> 03:02:03,560
It's my favorite area!

2678
03:02:03,680 --> 03:02:04,300
It's my favorite area!

2679
03:02:04,440 --> 03:02:06,060
It's my favorite area!

2680
03:02:06,320 --> 03:02:07,340
Run, run, run!

2681
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:17,840
You guys, I've been thinking like...

2682
03:02:18,360 --> 03:02:19,320
I'll be honest.

2683
03:02:19,960 --> 03:02:23,180
I really don't want to play Metal Gear Acid.

2684
03:02:23,180 --> 03:02:25,020
But I know I feel like I have to.

2685
03:02:25,960 --> 03:02:28,140
To complete my Metal Gear adventure.

2686
03:02:28,980 --> 03:02:31,520
But I just really don't want to.

2687
03:02:33,980 --> 03:02:35,760
How did you see me?

2688
03:02:42,220 --> 03:02:43,700
I really don't want to.

2689
03:02:45,220 --> 03:02:46,420
Wait, what did I just press?

2690
03:02:46,960 --> 03:02:47,260
Continue.

2691
03:02:47,840 --> 03:02:49,560
Oh my god, that scared the hell out of me.

2692
03:02:51,280 --> 03:02:52,920
That scared me so bad.

2693
03:02:53,320 --> 03:02:55,140
I'm gonna deer mask instead.

2694
03:02:55,140 --> 03:02:57,640
I think that was the best option here.

2695
03:02:58,760 --> 03:02:59,780
That's the deer mask.

2696
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:10,880
Oh my god!

2697
03:03:11,740 --> 03:03:14,420
Run, run, run!

2698
03:03:18,520 --> 03:03:19,620
Oh, it's this part.

2699
03:03:19,620 --> 03:03:19,740
Oh my god.

2700
03:03:31,500 --> 03:03:33,140
Is Acid like a card game?

2701
03:03:33,260 --> 03:03:33,820
It is.

2702
03:03:33,900 --> 03:03:35,620
It's like Kingdom Hearts...

2703
03:03:36,400 --> 03:03:37,440
Chain of Memories.

2704
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:39,100
If you know, you know.

2705
03:03:49,720 --> 03:03:51,160
I hate this kid here.

2706
03:03:51,640 --> 03:03:52,800
I hate this kid here.

2707
03:04:03,690 --> 03:04:05,370
So I don't know if I'll play it.

2708
03:04:05,510 --> 03:04:08,230
Maybe then go to...

2709
03:04:08,230 --> 03:04:10,290
Go into...

2710
03:04:10,290 --> 03:04:11,970
Actually, why don't I just do this?

2711
03:04:12,830 --> 03:04:13,970
This would be so much faster.

2712
03:04:16,150 --> 03:04:18,890
I don't know why I'm sticking around.

2713
03:04:32,930 --> 03:04:33,390
Um...

2714
03:04:33,390 --> 03:04:34,210
But yeah, I might go.

2715
03:04:34,310 --> 03:04:43,450
I don't know if I'll do Acid or if I'll just play Metal Gear Solid 4 once I'm back.

2716
03:04:43,930 --> 03:04:44,730
One or the other.

2717
03:04:48,550 --> 03:04:49,990
Oh, this is the room!

2718
03:04:49,990 --> 03:04:54,950
With that missile tow launcher you should be able to destroy the electrical switchboard.

2719
03:04:55,330 --> 03:04:58,170
It's in that room filled with gas.

2720
03:04:59,310 --> 03:05:00,690
It's filled with gas.

2721
03:05:01,930 --> 03:05:06,330
I'm with my parents watching your stream and they're listening to you scream at kids.

2722
03:05:06,470 --> 03:05:07,150
Merry Christmas.

2723
03:05:08,590 --> 03:05:09,870
Hi parents!

2724
03:05:12,450 --> 03:05:13,730
Hi parents!

2725
03:05:16,250 --> 03:05:17,570
I'm not naughty.

2726
03:05:17,650 --> 03:05:18,510
I'm very good.

2727
03:05:24,470 --> 03:05:29,710
Okay, the Nikita missile though might be the end of me.

2728
03:05:30,750 --> 03:05:32,410
How do I...

2729
03:05:32,410 --> 03:05:32,950
Oops.

2730
03:05:33,450 --> 03:05:35,030
How do I get this?

2731
03:05:40,010 --> 03:05:41,110
Oh my god.

2732
03:05:42,410 --> 03:05:45,030
Yeah, Santa told me yesterday I was nice.

2733
03:05:45,110 --> 03:05:46,270
I was on the nice list.

2734
03:05:51,840 --> 03:05:52,280
What?

2735
03:05:52,720 --> 03:05:54,860
No, this is impossible.

2736
03:05:55,840 --> 03:05:56,280
What?

2737
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,360
Yo, how am I supposed to get past everything?

2738
03:06:07,180 --> 03:06:09,780
There's no slowdown option, I don't think.

2739
03:06:10,760 --> 03:06:11,900
Hold on, let me see.

2740
03:06:12,060 --> 03:06:14,200
Hold down control to look down the sights and release the fire.

2741
03:06:14,300 --> 03:06:14,840
Control the missile.

2742
03:06:14,940 --> 03:06:16,220
Nope, there's no slowdown.

2743
03:06:18,200 --> 03:06:19,700
Oh my god, no.

2744
03:06:29,960 --> 03:06:32,940
Santa said that shortly after you sang about burning your wisps.

2745
03:06:34,200 --> 03:06:34,920
No, what?

2746
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:35,900
It was a song.

2747
03:06:37,260 --> 03:06:39,260
You don't appreciate art?

2748
03:06:45,340 --> 03:06:45,860
Eyes!

2749
03:07:03,690 --> 03:07:04,210
Eyes!

2750
03:07:14,110 --> 03:07:17,190
Now we can use...

2751
03:07:18,030 --> 03:07:20,590
We can use... what's it called?

2752
03:07:23,910 --> 03:07:25,830
A no-breathe box.

2753
03:07:34,700 --> 03:07:37,320
We absolutely gamed, let's go.

2754
03:07:43,770 --> 03:07:44,690
Nice.

2755
03:07:49,110 --> 03:07:50,590
There's some children here.

2756
03:07:53,070 --> 03:07:54,910
There's some children here.

2757
03:08:02,070 --> 03:08:02,550
OK.

2758
03:08:03,210 --> 03:08:04,150
Wait, where am I going?

2759
03:08:04,710 --> 03:08:06,390
Oh, I have to go up through there.

2760
03:08:09,070 --> 03:08:10,530
So we... oh gosh.

2761
03:08:10,630 --> 03:08:11,510
OK, we come here.

2762
03:08:14,570 --> 03:08:15,370
Oh my god.

2763
03:08:15,450 --> 03:08:15,990
Wait, what?

2764
03:08:16,530 --> 03:08:17,530
It attracts everybody?

2765
03:08:24,620 --> 03:08:25,100
Nice.

2766
03:08:25,100 --> 03:08:25,180
Nice.

2767
03:08:31,950 --> 03:08:36,090
Maybe it's kind of awesome that it attracted everybody actually.

2768
03:08:37,190 --> 03:08:37,750
Yippee!

2769
03:08:40,490 --> 03:08:42,290
What if I had my toast?

2770
03:08:44,810 --> 03:08:46,290
It's not jammed now.

2771
03:08:47,010 --> 03:08:48,430
If it works, it works.

2772
03:08:48,990 --> 03:08:51,170
I totally planned that.

2773
03:08:51,410 --> 03:08:51,890
Just saying.

2774
03:08:52,890 --> 03:08:56,190
I totally planned that.

2775
03:08:56,190 --> 03:08:58,190
Oh my god.

2776
03:09:05,130 --> 03:09:06,070
That's our chocolate!

2777
03:09:06,330 --> 03:09:07,390
Thanks for the 50 gifted!

2778
03:09:07,610 --> 03:09:08,010
Thank you!

2779
03:09:17,370 --> 03:09:23,270
If the dev is still here, if you make a Merry Gears Solid 3, I want to be in your game.

2780
03:09:24,610 --> 03:09:26,150
Let me voice in your game.

2781
03:09:27,550 --> 03:09:27,970
Please.

2782
03:09:31,890 --> 03:09:33,210
Is this an official game?

2783
03:09:33,310 --> 03:09:34,530
No, it's a fan game.

2784
03:09:45,310 --> 03:09:46,210
Cookie eater?

2785
03:09:46,210 --> 03:09:46,370
Cookie eater?

2786
03:09:56,580 --> 03:09:58,120
Not gonna happen!

2787
03:09:58,500 --> 03:09:58,780
No!

2788
03:10:04,190 --> 03:10:06,390
No, we got shut down so fast.

2789
03:10:10,370 --> 03:10:13,550
Is it because I keep talking about wanting to kill the children?

2790
03:10:14,290 --> 03:10:14,890
I'm sorry.

2791
03:10:17,070 --> 03:10:19,010
Sorry, I'm a violent ghost.

2792
03:10:21,790 --> 03:10:23,850
I enjoy all the killing.

2793
03:10:24,310 --> 03:10:24,930
That's why.

2794
03:10:25,170 --> 03:10:25,370
Wait.

2795
03:10:27,490 --> 03:10:28,590
What's...oh it's this kid.

2796
03:10:28,590 --> 03:10:32,070
Merry, merry, merry...

2797
03:10:35,610 --> 03:10:47,530
You saw nothing kid.

2798
03:10:48,030 --> 03:10:49,190
You saw nothing kid.

2799
03:10:52,340 --> 03:10:52,910
Yep!

2800
03:10:53,110 --> 03:10:53,970
Exactly!

2801
03:11:01,190 --> 03:11:01,630
Exactly.

2802
03:11:01,910 --> 03:11:03,810
Just your imagination, little kid.

2803
03:11:09,530 --> 03:11:09,970
Mariano!

2804
03:11:10,390 --> 03:11:11,550
Thank you so much for the fit together.

2805
03:11:11,830 --> 03:11:12,650
Thank you!

2806
03:11:13,250 --> 03:11:14,850
Thank you so much.

2807
03:11:26,810 --> 03:11:29,930
Now we have a Joy to the World included in the remix.

2808
03:11:30,070 --> 03:11:30,730
I love it.

2809
03:11:30,730 --> 03:11:33,490
Do, do, do, do.

2810
03:11:34,590 --> 03:11:35,190
Okay.

2811
03:11:35,590 --> 03:11:35,670
Oh.

2812
03:11:36,350 --> 03:11:36,950
Okay.

2813
03:11:41,310 --> 03:11:41,590
Oh no!

2814
03:11:42,570 --> 03:11:43,410
Wait, what do you mean?

2815
03:11:47,870 --> 03:11:48,470
No.

2816
03:11:55,850 --> 03:11:57,050
What's that supposed to mean?

2817
03:11:58,450 --> 03:11:59,490
That's scary.

2818
03:11:59,650 --> 03:12:00,150
Panther!

2819
03:12:00,310 --> 03:12:01,190
Thank you for another 50!

2820
03:12:02,390 --> 03:12:03,650
Thank you so much!

2821
03:12:10,210 --> 03:12:10,810
Yeah.

2822
03:12:15,110 --> 03:12:15,710
Right.

2823
03:12:18,590 --> 03:12:20,070
Can I attack them?

2824
03:12:21,590 --> 03:12:22,090
Oh no!

2825
03:12:26,470 --> 03:12:27,310
I'm Santa!

2826
03:12:30,190 --> 03:12:31,810
Mariano, thank you for the fit!

2827
03:12:32,730 --> 03:12:33,990
Ducky, thanks for the party!

2828
03:12:41,310 --> 03:12:42,810
Maizo, thank you for the fit!

2829
03:12:43,810 --> 03:12:44,750
Oh.

2830
03:12:48,070 --> 03:12:49,150
Snake!

2831
03:12:53,310 --> 03:12:54,430
Just a box.

2832
03:12:59,360 --> 03:13:00,120
What happened?

2833
03:13:06,680 --> 03:13:08,420
Stalking, stalking.

2834
03:13:08,580 --> 03:13:09,120
It's so funny.

2835
03:13:09,580 --> 03:13:10,620
Oh my God!

2836
03:13:14,560 --> 03:13:16,700
I don't hear any music.

2837
03:13:17,160 --> 03:13:17,520
Music!

2838
03:13:23,400 --> 03:13:26,300
Wait, can I flip in this form too?

2839
03:13:30,260 --> 03:13:34,080
Oh, no ghosts?

2840
03:13:34,680 --> 03:13:35,400
I was gone.

2841
03:13:38,260 --> 03:13:40,080
Okay, the ghosts are gone.

2842
03:13:40,080 --> 03:13:40,920
Okay.

2843
03:13:44,140 --> 03:13:46,120
I've become a sim.

2844
03:13:46,540 --> 03:13:47,860
I'm ready to woohoo!

2845
03:13:48,280 --> 03:13:50,720
Any other sims around wanting to woohoo?

2846
03:13:54,340 --> 03:13:55,220
Where are my clothes?

2847
03:13:56,900 --> 03:13:57,980
No way!

2848
03:13:58,640 --> 03:13:59,080
Stop!

2849
03:13:59,160 --> 03:13:59,800
It's the house!

2850
03:14:00,240 --> 03:14:01,940
I recognize this house!

2851
03:14:02,020 --> 03:14:03,880
It's the house from the first game!

2852
03:14:07,400 --> 03:14:08,120
Stop!

2853
03:14:12,260 --> 03:14:15,500
Doom, doom, doo, doo, doom, doom.

2854
03:14:17,510 --> 03:14:19,930
The Ghost of Christmas Past, yeah!

2855
03:14:30,330 --> 03:14:32,430
What do you mean by that?

2856
03:14:34,510 --> 03:14:35,830
Looking for my clothes.

2857
03:14:36,090 --> 03:14:37,250
No children in sight.

2858
03:14:38,610 --> 03:14:40,170
Looking for my clothes.

2859
03:14:41,450 --> 03:14:43,730
Wandering around naked in this house.

2860
03:14:46,330 --> 03:14:47,530
What the hell is this?

2861
03:14:48,650 --> 03:14:52,150
Oh yeah, this is to avoid the lasers there.

2862
03:14:58,330 --> 03:15:04,010
Wait, I don't have any items.

2863
03:15:04,390 --> 03:15:04,390
Okay.

2864
03:15:05,650 --> 03:15:07,210
Following in his footsteps.

2865
03:15:17,340 --> 03:15:18,660
Bravo, Kojumbo.

2866
03:15:22,190 --> 03:15:23,890
It lags a little bit though.

2867
03:15:24,430 --> 03:15:27,390
I can't tell if that's the game or my computer.

2868
03:15:29,290 --> 03:15:29,950
Interesting.

2869
03:15:31,370 --> 03:15:32,190
Oh gosh.

2870
03:15:37,050 --> 03:15:38,710
I'm just going to walk through?

2871
03:15:41,610 --> 03:15:43,030
Okay, easy.

2872
03:15:43,030 --> 03:15:43,810
Easy.

2873
03:15:44,190 --> 03:15:45,190
Merry Christmas, Mito.

2874
03:15:45,290 --> 03:15:45,810
Merry Christmas!

2875
03:15:54,410 --> 03:15:59,830
Oh my god, MGS4.

2876
03:16:02,590 --> 03:16:04,050
Oh my god!

2877
03:16:11,020 --> 03:16:13,120
The MGS4 flashback.

2878
03:16:13,220 --> 03:16:14,600
When you go back to Shadow Moses.

2879
03:16:14,820 --> 03:16:15,080
Stop!

2880
03:16:15,920 --> 03:16:19,600
The idea that a bunch of little ballerina girls fully undress Snake is kind of freaky.

2881
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:21,360
Don't say it like that!

2882
03:16:31,080 --> 03:16:32,620
I didn't know that.

2883
03:16:34,920 --> 03:16:36,340
This music is so dramatic.

2884
03:16:48,160 --> 03:16:50,500
I wonder if this game was made...

2885
03:16:51,360 --> 03:16:55,360
I mean, Merry Gear Solid 2 was made before MGSV.

2886
03:16:57,320 --> 03:16:57,840
Because...

2887
03:16:57,840 --> 03:17:01,500
Are the tadpoles supposed to be the skull unit?

2888
03:17:01,740 --> 03:17:05,020
Or are they supposed to be... I mean, I imagine they're supposed to be the beauties.

2889
03:17:05,500 --> 03:17:05,760
Right?

2890
03:17:06,620 --> 03:17:07,100
I guess.

2891
03:17:07,660 --> 03:17:08,660
It was made before V.

2892
03:17:11,260 --> 03:17:12,500
They're the frogs.

2893
03:17:14,200 --> 03:17:17,580
The frogs from MGS... What are the frogs in MGS4?

2894
03:17:18,920 --> 03:17:20,520
What the hell is the frog unit?

2895
03:17:22,980 --> 03:17:24,580
What the hell are the frogs?

2896
03:17:25,200 --> 03:17:26,980
I don't remember these guys at all.

2897
03:17:28,440 --> 03:17:31,160
All the guys apparently in it was fighting.

2898
03:17:35,960 --> 03:17:38,580
I'm thinking of... Wait, the beauties though.

2899
03:17:40,320 --> 03:17:41,880
I don't remember their names.

2900
03:17:41,920 --> 03:17:43,580
I don't remember the frogs.

2901
03:17:43,920 --> 03:17:45,200
I don't remember the frogs.

2902
03:17:48,100 --> 03:17:48,940
Fake fan.

2903
03:17:50,360 --> 03:17:51,420
I'm a fake fan.

2904
03:17:51,520 --> 03:17:52,400
Oh my clothes!

2905
03:17:55,200 --> 03:17:56,460
My Santa suit.

2906
03:17:58,000 --> 03:17:58,640
Santa suit.

2907
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:01,480
No!

2908
03:18:08,580 --> 03:18:09,020
Wait, what?

2909
03:18:14,080 --> 03:18:15,440
So true.

2910
03:18:16,020 --> 03:18:20,540
He said minutes, but the subtitle said seconds.

2911
03:18:23,480 --> 03:18:33,840
I got all my stuff back.

2912
03:18:35,220 --> 03:18:37,120
Wait, so... Hold on, I want to see.

2913
03:18:37,120 --> 03:18:39,940
Why is it so laggy?

2914
03:18:49,340 --> 03:18:51,500
Hopefully this doesn't...

2915
03:18:51,500 --> 03:18:54,120
I think I know which game Mint's playing after break.

2916
03:18:54,400 --> 03:18:57,880
Yeah, apparently I need to play MGS3 again.

2917
03:18:58,800 --> 03:18:59,560
I mean, sorry, 4.

2918
03:19:01,360 --> 03:19:03,400
I only remember the beauties.

2919
03:19:04,200 --> 03:19:05,420
And I remember... OK.

2920
03:19:08,580 --> 03:19:09,960
To be fair...

2921
03:19:12,320 --> 03:19:14,520
To be fair...

2922
03:19:14,520 --> 03:19:17,820
There's like 2 guys that I don't know at all.

2923
03:19:17,940 --> 03:19:19,320
There's like 2 randos.

2924
03:19:19,540 --> 03:19:19,920
What are they?

2925
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:21,480
Policenaut...

2926
03:19:23,900 --> 03:19:24,860
Reference guys...

2927
03:19:24,860 --> 03:19:26,080
In the unit.

2928
03:19:26,560 --> 03:19:28,280
And then also...

2929
03:19:28,280 --> 03:19:31,960
All I remember is anytime you see Meryl's unit, Johnny's shitting his pants.

2930
03:19:32,040 --> 03:19:33,160
That's all I remember, OK?

2931
03:19:34,780 --> 03:19:36,820
Whenever I see them...

2932
03:19:36,820 --> 03:19:39,540
Johnny's just... Johnny's literally a snatcher.

2933
03:19:39,660 --> 03:19:41,300
Sorry, it was snatcher, not policenaut, yeah.

2934
03:19:44,360 --> 03:19:45,440
And then...

2935
03:19:46,240 --> 03:19:49,280
It's really the beauties that steal the show.

2936
03:19:49,940 --> 03:19:52,820
Because they...

2937
03:19:53,540 --> 03:19:56,720
Oh my gosh, why is it so slow?

2938
03:19:57,840 --> 03:20:02,100
You fight the beauties and then you get the whole trauma dump from Drebin.

2939
03:20:03,400 --> 03:20:05,140
It's not that I've forgotten completely.

2940
03:20:05,140 --> 03:20:07,580
It's just they're not important.

2941
03:20:08,340 --> 03:20:10,460
The frog unit's not important.

2942
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:24,000
Thank you for the 10 gifted thank you.

2943
03:20:25,260 --> 03:20:26,060
Oh my god.

2944
03:20:26,180 --> 03:20:29,020
Guys, I feel like Old Snake for real.

2945
03:20:29,680 --> 03:20:31,160
Oh, I'm Old Snake for real.

2946
03:20:31,320 --> 03:20:32,160
Oh my god.

2947
03:20:41,700 --> 03:20:42,920
Oh, we're outside.

2948
03:20:49,980 --> 03:20:52,260
I'm Cold Snake if his limbs got frozen.

2949
03:20:52,520 --> 03:20:53,640
Shut up!

2950
03:20:53,760 --> 03:20:54,300
What?

2951
03:20:57,980 --> 03:20:59,100
Merry Gear!

2952
03:21:16,840 --> 03:21:19,340
It looks like a postman.

2953
03:21:21,200 --> 03:21:23,300
A sniper.

2954
03:21:26,200 --> 03:21:31,440
Christmas yet to come.

2955
03:21:36,420 --> 03:21:37,260
Stop.

2956
03:21:48,140 --> 03:21:49,240
It's like a pun.

2957
03:21:54,240 --> 03:21:57,340
We just pun after pun and pun attack.

2958
03:22:08,680 --> 03:22:09,880
Father Christmas.

2959
03:22:09,880 --> 03:22:10,300
Ah!

2960
03:22:14,700 --> 03:22:16,200
Frosty Frost?

2961
03:22:16,480 --> 03:22:17,000
Wait, what?

2962
03:22:23,620 --> 03:22:24,400
It's pure.

2963
03:22:25,500 --> 03:22:27,480
It's a pure idea.

2964
03:22:40,360 --> 03:22:41,060
Cool.

2965
03:22:57,240 --> 03:23:00,520
The Santa Claus?

2966
03:23:09,880 --> 03:23:11,140
Oh my god!

2967
03:23:13,080 --> 03:23:13,440
No!

2968
03:23:17,440 --> 03:23:23,080
But what if someone else still thought of him?

2969
03:23:34,520 --> 03:23:35,640
I can't.

2970
03:23:40,570 --> 03:23:43,100
But we still haven't figured out the last passcode.

2971
03:23:57,760 --> 03:24:00,680
Time to seal your fate.

2972
03:24:01,160 --> 03:24:05,400
Do I

2973
03:24:12,240 --> 03:24:13,820
just shoot him?

2974
03:24:13,820 --> 03:24:15,080
Oh my god.

2975
03:24:15,160 --> 03:24:16,700
It's so...

2976
03:24:21,140 --> 03:24:22,180
Oh, guys.

2977
03:24:22,380 --> 03:24:23,020
You guys.

2978
03:24:23,600 --> 03:24:25,960
I can't move at all.

2979
03:24:26,120 --> 03:24:27,340
Why is my game like this?

2980
03:24:28,040 --> 03:24:29,120
It's so laggy.

2981
03:24:34,190 --> 03:24:35,730
It's so laggy, you guys.

2982
03:24:35,810 --> 03:24:37,030
I don't even have bullets now.

2983
03:24:42,760 --> 03:24:44,260
Can you restart the game?

2984
03:24:45,620 --> 03:24:46,400
Oh, sorry.

2985
03:24:46,500 --> 03:24:47,000
I just stopped.

2986
03:24:48,960 --> 03:24:52,120
It seems like all of the ghosts are delivery men of some kind.

2987
03:24:52,240 --> 03:24:54,220
Turn off ray tracing.

2988
03:24:56,420 --> 03:24:57,020
Well,

2989
03:25:03,140 --> 03:25:04,620
you asked for a slowdown.

2990
03:25:09,820 --> 03:25:11,480
I'm a box to be delivered!

2991
03:25:15,900 --> 03:25:17,580
That didn't work, you guys.

2992
03:25:21,140 --> 03:25:22,100
Oh, gosh.

2993
03:25:22,200 --> 03:25:24,020
I'm afraid if I...

2994
03:25:24,020 --> 03:25:26,360
I'm afraid if I quit the game.

2995
03:25:26,540 --> 03:25:28,800
What if it doesn't save?

2996
03:25:29,180 --> 03:25:30,200
Should we take the risk?

2997
03:25:33,420 --> 03:25:37,580
Should we take the risk and exit out the game?

2998
03:25:39,720 --> 03:25:40,300
Hold on.

2999
03:25:40,340 --> 03:25:41,660
Let me go back inside, maybe.

3000
03:25:45,050 --> 03:25:48,050
I don't know how to manually save, you guys.

3001
03:25:48,170 --> 03:25:49,410
I don't know how to access the menu.

3002
03:25:50,350 --> 03:25:53,670
I can't go back inside, so...

3003
03:25:53,670 --> 03:26:00,000
What if I just do this?

3004
03:26:00,980 --> 03:26:01,520
Hold on.

3005
03:26:01,860 --> 03:26:03,280
I just noticed the mailbox.

3006
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:07,220
Do you think he'll come here?

3007
03:26:08,240 --> 03:26:09,180
There's a package!

3008
03:26:13,820 --> 03:26:14,580
Oh, God.

3009
03:26:14,700 --> 03:26:16,080
Okay, I'm gonna close out the game.

3010
03:26:16,520 --> 03:26:17,380
Okay, here we go.

3011
03:26:19,060 --> 03:26:19,820
Let's see!

3012
03:26:19,960 --> 03:26:21,020
Oh, I'm nervous!

3013
03:26:22,300 --> 03:26:23,200
Should I auto-save?

3014
03:26:23,300 --> 03:26:23,720
Oh, sorry.

3015
03:26:23,820 --> 03:26:24,360
It's teeny tiny.

3016
03:26:24,520 --> 03:26:25,380
I have to adjust it.

3017
03:26:31,060 --> 03:26:32,900
I don't know where I had it before.

3018
03:26:35,300 --> 03:26:37,620
Press CTRL to skip the codec whenever the... Oh, thank you!

3019
03:26:39,120 --> 03:26:39,900
Okay, continue?

3020
03:26:40,860 --> 03:26:41,620
Ah, perfect!

3021
03:26:42,500 --> 03:26:42,940
Yay!

3022
03:26:47,780 --> 03:26:49,080
Also, guys, don't fault the game.

3023
03:26:49,240 --> 03:26:50,520
It's old, so it's all good.

3024
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:52,240
Firetruck, welcome to membership.

3025
03:26:53,000 --> 03:26:54,460
Turn off the game console.

3026
03:26:55,240 --> 03:26:55,560
Yay!

3027
03:26:55,940 --> 03:26:56,120
Okay.

3028
03:26:56,580 --> 03:26:58,860
Alright, now we have to...

3029
03:27:05,380 --> 03:27:07,520
Okay, he gets me every time.

3030
03:27:07,600 --> 03:27:07,740
Oops.

3031
03:27:08,940 --> 03:27:12,280
It seems like all of the ghosts are delivery men of some kind.

3032
03:27:12,400 --> 03:27:13,700
And disgruntled ones at that.

3033
03:27:14,060 --> 03:27:16,620
Maybe there is some way you can use his occupation against him.

3034
03:27:16,960 --> 03:27:18,880
Kind of like you did with the milkman.

3035
03:27:22,890 --> 03:27:29,110
Watch, the game is so old that you need to e-mail yourself an AOL e-mail.

3036
03:27:29,290 --> 03:27:33,650
And you need the You Got Mail sound to play and he'll hear it.

3037
03:27:33,730 --> 03:27:36,350
And then he'll come out and you can get him.

3038
03:27:39,950 --> 03:27:41,330
You got mail.

3039
03:27:41,650 --> 03:27:42,870
You got mail.

3040
03:27:43,610 --> 03:27:46,770
I don't think going by the mailbox works.

3041
03:27:48,190 --> 03:27:50,230
How do I get him to come out?

3042
03:27:51,070 --> 03:27:51,370
Hello!

3043
03:27:52,810 --> 03:27:55,830
I'm an unassuming...

3044
03:27:55,830 --> 03:27:58,110
Okay, let's try the missile now since I can.

3045
03:28:02,150 --> 03:28:03,750
He shoots down my missile!

3046
03:28:03,750 --> 03:28:03,850
Hello!

3047
03:28:07,070 --> 03:28:08,250
You got mail.

3048
03:28:08,770 --> 03:28:09,830
You got mail.

3049
03:28:12,850 --> 03:28:13,930
He's too good.

3050
03:28:18,130 --> 03:28:19,270
Oh wait, let me try.

3051
03:28:19,370 --> 03:28:21,230
Maybe if I hit it...

3052
03:28:22,270 --> 03:28:25,470
Can I lift the little thingy on it?

3053
03:28:31,270 --> 03:28:32,310
Knock on the mailbox.

3054
03:28:32,590 --> 03:28:33,530
Oh, knock on it.

3055
03:28:33,550 --> 03:28:34,010
Let's try it.

3056
03:28:41,840 --> 03:28:44,560
Maybe if... Can I knock on it from the front?

3057
03:28:44,720 --> 03:28:45,100
Let me try.

3058
03:29:01,980 --> 03:29:02,820
Something to...

3059
03:29:02,820 --> 03:29:06,700
Something to... I feel like it has to be with the box, right?

3060
03:29:08,560 --> 03:29:08,980
Because...

3061
03:29:17,330 --> 03:29:19,370
Because that makes the most sense.

3062
03:29:19,570 --> 03:29:20,990
It could be the other box.

3063
03:29:22,590 --> 03:29:24,030
I don't know if it makes a difference.

3064
03:29:29,390 --> 03:29:30,790
Anything on thermals.

3065
03:29:35,380 --> 03:29:35,940
No?

3066
03:29:41,060 --> 03:29:42,700
Maybe I can shoot it.

3067
03:29:43,460 --> 03:29:45,160
We're gonna try everything we got.

3068
03:29:47,920 --> 03:29:49,440
Box on the doorstep.

3069
03:29:49,600 --> 03:29:50,800
That's a good idea too.

3070
03:30:01,900 --> 03:30:04,260
I would love to be delivered...

3071
03:30:05,980 --> 03:30:07,100
To the family.

3072
03:30:08,640 --> 03:30:09,900
Go around the building.

3073
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:10,660
I don't think you can.

3074
03:30:12,140 --> 03:30:12,780
No?

3075
03:30:13,960 --> 03:30:15,220
Knock on the door.

3076
03:30:24,870 --> 03:30:25,510
Delivery!

3077
03:30:28,880 --> 03:30:30,840
If anybody knows, can I get a hint?

3078
03:30:35,840 --> 03:30:38,440
I can't get any closer to him, so I'm like...

3079
03:30:42,560 --> 03:30:44,060
It's really silly.

3080
03:30:45,180 --> 03:30:46,260
Really silly?

3081
03:30:46,260 --> 03:30:46,380
Really?

3082
03:30:53,030 --> 03:30:54,450
Walk with the box.

3083
03:30:54,510 --> 03:30:55,390
I tried that before.

3084
03:30:55,530 --> 03:30:56,310
It didn't work.

3085
03:31:01,960 --> 03:31:03,000
Really silly.

3086
03:31:03,460 --> 03:31:04,460
Really silly.

3087
03:31:05,440 --> 03:31:06,500
Really silly?

3088
03:31:15,810 --> 03:31:16,890
I'll show you guys.

3089
03:31:17,110 --> 03:31:17,850
Just so you know.

3090
03:31:24,310 --> 03:31:25,510
Call Otacon again?

3091
03:31:25,670 --> 03:31:26,610
I'll call... Yeah, let's try it.

3092
03:31:34,250 --> 03:31:35,290
I'm trying!

3093
03:31:38,550 --> 03:31:39,330
I'm a box.

3094
03:31:39,490 --> 03:31:40,290
I'm a box.

3095
03:31:40,410 --> 03:31:40,930
I'm a box.

3096
03:31:40,950 --> 03:31:42,170
I'm a box to be delivered.

3097
03:31:42,310 --> 03:31:43,150
I'm a box to be delivered.

3098
03:31:43,530 --> 03:31:45,130
I'm a box to be delivered!

3099
03:31:46,290 --> 03:31:46,810
Please!

3100
03:31:47,090 --> 03:31:47,890
Come out!

3101
03:31:48,270 --> 03:31:49,130
Come here!

3102
03:31:49,390 --> 03:31:50,570
Come get me!

3103
03:31:55,660 --> 03:31:57,060
Oops, I didn't mean to press C.

3104
03:32:05,180 --> 03:32:06,200
Uh-huh.

3105
03:32:07,440 --> 03:32:08,060
My socks?

3106
03:32:14,000 --> 03:32:15,220
My socks?

3107
03:32:15,980 --> 03:32:17,560
Something to do with my socks?

3108
03:32:20,440 --> 03:32:21,560
My socks?

3109
03:32:24,240 --> 03:32:26,600
Is he jealous of... Does he like my socks?

3110
03:32:35,990 --> 03:32:37,170
Polar gun him.

3111
03:32:37,270 --> 03:32:41,030
I don't think that's gonna work, but I will try it.

3112
03:32:41,370 --> 03:32:41,630
Wait.

3113
03:32:45,230 --> 03:32:46,570
It's just a waste of my bullets.

3114
03:32:50,570 --> 03:32:53,590
Do I put my socks in the mail?

3115
03:32:55,070 --> 03:32:57,090
Does he want to smell my feet?

3116
03:32:58,430 --> 03:32:59,290
Call again?

3117
03:32:59,410 --> 03:33:01,590
Yeah, we'll just wait until he tells us the answer.

3118
03:33:03,110 --> 03:33:03,370
Yeah.

3119
03:33:21,930 --> 03:33:23,590
Doesn't make much sense though.

3120
03:33:24,590 --> 03:33:26,590
He's like...

3121
03:33:31,170 --> 03:33:31,890
Huh?

3122
03:33:41,720 --> 03:33:42,800
Wait.

3123
03:33:45,140 --> 03:33:47,900
I was gonna... Yeah!

3124
03:33:53,340 --> 03:33:53,880
Ah!

3125
03:33:54,420 --> 03:33:55,080
I see it!

3126
03:33:55,620 --> 03:33:56,060
Yes!

3127
03:33:56,100 --> 03:33:56,760
I knew it!

3128
03:34:01,900 --> 03:34:02,820
Grandad!

3129
03:34:02,940 --> 03:34:04,140
Package.zip!

3130
03:34:09,480 --> 03:34:10,460
Oh my gosh!

3131
03:34:10,700 --> 03:34:10,720
Shut up!

3132
03:34:18,340 --> 03:34:20,320
Oh my God!

3133
03:34:24,280 --> 03:34:25,620
That's so funny!

3134
03:34:30,620 --> 03:34:33,420
But I can shoot a grenade that far.

3135
03:34:48,710 --> 03:34:49,530
Wait.

3136
03:34:52,090 --> 03:34:52,910
OK

3137
03:34:59,310 --> 03:35:01,090
Pumble him to the ground!

3138
03:35:17,790 --> 03:35:20,590
Tiny Tim!

3139
03:35:26,390 --> 03:35:29,650
Oh my God!

3140
03:35:52,290 --> 03:35:55,050
Tragic Tim.

3141
03:36:11,490 --> 03:36:13,250
In the first place.

3142
03:36:19,270 --> 03:36:20,410
Tragic Tim.

3143
03:36:26,750 --> 03:36:29,550
Another wrench?

3144
03:36:50,190 --> 03:36:50,870
No.

3145
03:36:57,550 --> 03:36:59,330
No I didn't.

3146
03:37:03,010 --> 03:37:05,010
Yeah, I did notice that.

3147
03:37:05,350 --> 03:37:06,050
I did notice that.

3148
03:37:14,610 --> 03:37:15,630
Oh my God!

3149
03:37:20,290 --> 03:37:20,970
Oh my God!

3150
03:37:24,930 --> 03:37:27,590
Did you try 1, 2, 2, 5?

3151
03:37:41,490 --> 03:37:42,330
Blah, blah.

3152
03:37:51,330 --> 03:37:54,050
What a twist.

3153
03:38:12,850 --> 03:38:15,030
The Ghost of Christmas Past.

3154
03:38:21,430 --> 03:38:25,630
There are so many Nicks and Santas and Juniors.

3155
03:38:25,630 --> 03:38:27,630
Juniors and...

3156
03:38:28,650 --> 03:38:47,150
I mean that would be actually really great.

3157
03:38:48,490 --> 03:38:49,450
No!

3158
03:38:50,170 --> 03:38:51,950
Not the VR training!

3159
03:38:56,630 --> 03:38:57,170
No!

3160
03:38:58,030 --> 03:38:59,190
There it is!

3161
03:39:02,450 --> 03:39:03,870
The MGS2 twist.

3162
03:39:16,630 --> 03:39:17,670
No!

3163
03:39:18,510 --> 03:39:19,950
But the children love Christmas.

3164
03:39:25,630 --> 03:39:29,030
That's not something you'll ever have to worry about.

3165
03:39:32,390 --> 03:39:33,230
Wait!

3166
03:39:36,430 --> 03:39:39,310
Don't we have...don't we have Timmy?

3167
03:39:44,490 --> 03:39:45,530
What were his last words?

3168
03:40:02,320 --> 03:40:04,160
That was it!

3169
03:40:13,920 --> 03:40:16,080
Cold Snake.

3170
03:40:16,840 --> 03:40:17,620
Otacon.

3171
03:40:18,540 --> 03:40:19,140
Children.

3172
03:40:22,200 --> 03:40:25,000
Sorry Tadpoles, I forgot who you guys were.

3173
03:40:25,520 --> 03:40:26,740
Cindy Luhu.

3174
03:40:27,580 --> 03:40:30,480
Wait, we never figured out who that was.

3175
03:40:31,080 --> 03:40:33,700
Jack Frost, Nick Junior, Tragic Tim.

3176
03:40:42,480 --> 03:40:44,200
Yeah, I thought there would be a third boss.

3177
03:40:44,620 --> 03:40:45,900
That was so great though.

3178
03:40:46,720 --> 03:40:50,900
Especially like the ways that you really had to think outside the box for...

3179
03:40:51,480 --> 03:40:52,700
For the boss fight.

3180
03:40:52,820 --> 03:40:53,480
So awesome.

3181
03:40:55,580 --> 03:40:57,040
Maybe a post credit sequence.

3182
03:40:57,160 --> 03:40:58,400
I think so, I think so.

3183
03:41:00,560 --> 03:41:01,520
I mean...oh.

3184
03:41:05,900 --> 03:41:06,320
See!

3185
03:41:37,850 --> 03:41:38,670
Huh!

3186
03:41:51,150 --> 03:41:52,550
Aww.

3187
03:42:12,110 --> 03:42:13,510
Aww.

3188
03:42:17,510 --> 03:42:17,650
Huh?

3189
03:42:24,910 --> 03:42:25,790
Huh!

3190
03:42:29,530 --> 03:42:30,930
Ahh!

3191
03:42:38,830 --> 03:42:40,230
Hahaha!

3192
03:42:44,330 --> 03:42:50,190
He's even...he's got like the...the headband.

3193
03:42:51,650 --> 03:42:53,170
But it's his hat.

3194
03:43:01,370 --> 03:43:02,770
Oh.

3195
03:43:03,470 --> 03:43:04,170
Oh.

3196
03:43:07,350 --> 03:43:08,750
Ahh!

3197
03:43:33,170 --> 03:43:38,530
Yeah, it did seem a bit hard to believe that your brain could have managed to remain intact after a shot in the head.

3198
03:43:39,030 --> 03:43:42,050
So in the end, it all had to do with belief, huh?

3199
03:43:42,370 --> 03:43:42,930
The belief.

3200
03:43:43,990 --> 03:43:44,390
Yeah!

3201
03:43:44,990 --> 03:43:49,110
Tim used it to deceive the ghosts of Christmas past and to end Christmas once and for all.

3202
03:43:49,570 --> 03:43:52,430
But in the end, it was your beliefs that prevailed.

3203
03:43:52,670 --> 03:43:54,690
I don't see what my beliefs have to do with anything.

3204
03:43:54,790 --> 03:43:56,250
The Santa Claus, Snake.

3205
03:43:56,590 --> 03:44:00,550
This entire mission would have been for naught had it not been for your belief in my existence.

3206
03:44:00,550 --> 03:44:02,410
That's why you gotta believe in ghosts.

3207
03:44:09,230 --> 03:44:10,690
The Santa Claus.

3208
03:44:15,110 --> 03:44:16,710
Oh my god.

3209
03:44:23,170 --> 03:44:24,370
Secret Santa.

3210
03:44:24,370 --> 03:44:24,910
Secret Santa.

3211
03:44:29,370 --> 03:44:30,290
Oh my god.

3212
03:44:31,710 --> 03:44:33,390
I can see why there won't be a third one.

3213
03:44:34,350 --> 03:44:34,770
A third game.

3214
03:44:35,970 --> 03:44:37,310
Merry Christmas Santa Claus!

3215
03:45:01,400 --> 03:45:03,260
I feel you approaching.

3216
03:45:03,700 --> 03:45:07,400
I've waited all year.

3217
03:45:13,400 --> 03:45:15,320
Oh my god.

3218
03:45:19,080 --> 03:45:21,720
Trust no one, not even Santa Claus.

3219
03:45:22,300 --> 03:45:22,680
Yeah!

3220
03:45:26,080 --> 03:45:28,440
That was crazy!

3221
03:45:28,700 --> 03:45:29,200
More credits.

3222
03:45:29,300 --> 03:45:30,360
Are we getting after credits?

3223
03:45:30,360 --> 03:45:31,700
After credits.

3224
03:45:32,000 --> 03:45:32,920
Credits.

3225
03:45:33,160 --> 03:45:34,280
After, wait.

3226
03:45:35,200 --> 03:45:36,700
After after credits.

3227
03:45:37,460 --> 03:45:39,120
After credits after credits.

3228
03:45:39,820 --> 03:45:40,140
After.

3229
03:45:40,560 --> 03:45:42,920
Credits after credits after credits.

3230
03:45:48,900 --> 03:45:51,000
After after credits.

3231
03:45:51,520 --> 03:45:53,880
First milkman, then sailor man, now Santa.

3232
03:45:54,100 --> 03:45:58,400
Post after outro credits.

3233
03:45:58,400 --> 03:46:00,160
Post post credits.

3234
03:46:05,460 --> 03:46:08,880
Oh my god, Arthur Lee came up with this script.

3235
03:46:10,600 --> 03:46:11,200
Arthur.

3236
03:46:12,040 --> 03:46:13,800
Arthur like, oh my god.

3237
03:46:13,900 --> 03:46:15,360
Arthur did so much in this game.

3238
03:46:15,440 --> 03:46:16,000
What the hell?

3239
03:46:20,720 --> 03:46:22,760
Don't push start till Christmas.

3240
03:46:22,760 --> 03:46:24,020
It's...

3241
03:46:25,620 --> 03:46:27,480
Don't push start till Christmas.

3242
03:46:27,640 --> 03:46:28,340
Outer saving.

3243
03:46:29,080 --> 03:46:30,000
Tree top glistens.

3244
03:46:30,100 --> 03:46:31,060
Sentries listen.

3245
03:46:35,080 --> 03:46:37,640
Happy sneaking war is covert.

3246
03:46:37,820 --> 03:46:40,780
The very next day you gave my position away.

3247
03:46:44,940 --> 03:46:47,080
He sees you when you're sneaking.

3248
03:46:48,420 --> 03:46:49,300
Whoops, that's me.

3249
03:46:52,760 --> 03:46:56,460
You feed on some eggnog.

3250
03:46:56,480 --> 03:46:59,240
A clutter on the lawn.

3251
03:46:59,660 --> 03:47:02,860
I count some swans and you're gone.

3252
03:47:04,000 --> 03:47:06,380
This not snake eater is so great.

3253
03:47:13,010 --> 03:47:14,570
Eggnog drinker.

3254
03:47:17,190 --> 03:47:20,350
Oh, Mr. Claus.

3255
03:47:21,510 --> 03:47:23,110
Why must you leave?

3256
03:47:23,110 --> 03:47:27,090
I'll be lonely until Christmas Eve.

3257
03:47:32,590 --> 03:47:36,330
Until Christmas Eve.

3258
03:47:38,070 --> 03:47:41,150
Until Christmas Eve.

3259
03:47:41,230 --> 03:47:43,490
Merry Gear Solid 2.

3260
03:47:43,950 --> 03:47:45,830
I like how the L is still in the four shape.

3261
03:47:48,650 --> 03:47:51,450
Ghost of Christmas Past.

3262
03:47:59,090 --> 03:48:01,450
So what happened?

3263
03:48:01,650 --> 03:48:02,290
I don't know.

3264
03:48:02,290 --> 03:48:05,730
It seems like I might have inhaled a bit too much of that sleeping gas.

3265
03:48:06,170 --> 03:48:08,830
I can't remember a thing after I wished you a Merry Christmas.

3266
03:48:09,510 --> 03:48:12,250
Hmm, yeah, your codec call got out there too.

3267
03:48:12,690 --> 03:48:13,810
So, sleeping gas.

3268
03:48:13,830 --> 03:48:15,030
Why assume you've gotten into the Merry Gear?

3269
03:48:15,550 --> 03:48:16,450
I don't think so.

3270
03:48:17,150 --> 03:48:17,970
Why not?

3271
03:48:18,010 --> 03:48:20,210
Because when I woke up, the Merry Gear was gone.

3272
03:48:20,910 --> 03:48:22,950
Well, at least we've got Tragic Tim.

3273
03:48:23,670 --> 03:48:25,750
We can interrogate him once he wakes up.

3274
03:48:29,150 --> 03:48:30,770
If he wakes up.

3275
03:48:30,770 --> 03:48:34,750
Yes, it all went according to plan.

3276
03:48:36,990 --> 03:48:39,810
Yes, they all entered their passcodes.

3277
03:48:40,730 --> 03:48:43,230
But the Merry Gear is safely out of their hands.

3278
03:48:46,690 --> 03:48:50,450
It was as easy as hiding a package in the mission files.

3279
03:48:51,430 --> 03:48:53,470
They thought it was sleeping gas.

3280
03:48:54,470 --> 03:48:57,750
Yeah, the poison gas was quite effective.

3281
03:48:57,910 --> 03:48:58,990
Poison gas?

3282
03:48:58,990 --> 03:49:00,050
Forgetting serum.

3283
03:49:01,050 --> 03:49:02,150
Forgetting serum?

3284
03:49:02,630 --> 03:49:04,230
He won't remember that we'd even met.

3285
03:49:04,810 --> 03:49:06,510
Oh my god.

3286
03:49:07,030 --> 03:49:08,330
He had no idea.

3287
03:49:09,530 --> 03:49:13,910
I'm convinced he'd believe anything after all that double and triple crossing.

3288
03:49:15,970 --> 03:49:23,550
The corroborating information we learned from playing Merry Gear Solid Secret Santa only convinced him further.

3289
03:49:24,270 --> 03:49:27,030
With the VR training, my voice...

3290
03:49:27,030 --> 03:49:29,150
nearly indistinguishable from the original.

3291
03:49:31,070 --> 03:49:36,430
The bloodlines of the three wise men are cut, and the Merry Gear is ours.

3292
03:49:38,110 --> 03:49:41,030
Not a single person can get in our way.

3293
03:49:41,810 --> 03:49:45,490
If only the three wise men had been more complicit.

3294
03:49:46,250 --> 03:49:50,030
Not a single one of them entered their passcode when they had the chance.

3295
03:49:50,850 --> 03:49:54,990
Yes, the Hi-Ho-Ho-Ho shall rise again.

3296
03:49:58,150 --> 03:49:58,790
Problems?

3297
03:50:01,330 --> 03:50:05,030
I assumed it was just a matter of...

3298
03:50:05,970 --> 03:50:06,610
Bach!

3299
03:50:07,150 --> 03:50:07,590
Hamburg!

3300
03:50:08,370 --> 03:50:11,490
Then put the warheads in the boxes and learn some poop!

3301
03:50:28,120 --> 03:50:28,760
Scrooge?

3302
03:50:29,360 --> 03:50:37,620
Oh my gosh, we have to get Scrooge and we have to get the Grinch and we have to get...

3303
03:50:45,220 --> 03:50:47,240
Oh my god, the Hi-He-Ho-Ho...

3304
03:50:47,240 --> 03:50:50,020
Wait, the Hi-He-Ho-Ho-Ho really got me good.

3305
03:50:50,480 --> 03:50:52,340
Can't believe I'm an elephant in this game too.

3306
03:50:53,580 --> 03:50:57,740
Thanks for playing what was my unconventional introduction to Metal Gear so long ago.

3307
03:50:58,040 --> 03:51:01,300
For anyone who's curious, the dev is currently working on a game called Sun Kiss City.

3308
03:51:01,660 --> 03:51:03,720
A more urban take on Stardew Valley.

3309
03:51:04,100 --> 03:51:05,360
Which he also worked on.

3310
03:51:05,440 --> 03:51:05,620
Yo!

3311
03:51:06,060 --> 03:51:06,760
No way!

3312
03:51:07,460 --> 03:51:09,680
This twist is hurting my smooth boyin'.

3313
03:51:10,780 --> 03:51:12,440
Solid as Scrooge.

3314
03:51:13,840 --> 03:51:15,320
Enemies in love, Zero.

3315
03:51:16,020 --> 03:51:17,060
Oh my gosh, no!

3316
03:51:17,260 --> 03:51:18,360
I didn't get any!

3317
03:51:19,600 --> 03:51:22,680
I have nobody to love this Christmas.

3318
03:51:25,660 --> 03:51:27,360
Is there a Merry Gear 3?

3319
03:51:27,520 --> 03:51:28,380
There is not.

3320
03:51:28,980 --> 03:51:30,620
This was so great!

3321
03:51:31,040 --> 03:51:32,400
Oh my god, the twist!

3322
03:51:35,780 --> 03:51:37,060
Literally, me.

3323
03:51:37,060 --> 03:51:37,100
Me.

3324
03:51:43,590 --> 03:51:46,030
That was so good!

3325
03:51:46,610 --> 03:51:48,170
Oh my gosh.

3326
03:51:49,590 --> 03:51:50,730
So good.

3327
03:51:51,130 --> 03:51:52,090
Same, TBH.

3328
03:51:53,750 --> 03:51:55,630
This is a heck of a fan game.

3329
03:51:56,170 --> 03:51:59,850
You can tell they love the original Metal Gear so much.

3330
03:52:01,290 --> 03:52:03,810
And the other references were great too.

3331
03:52:05,850 --> 03:52:07,010
So good.

3332
03:52:12,950 --> 03:52:15,390
This is the most minto game you could ever play on Christmas.

3333
03:52:15,610 --> 03:52:16,710
Thank you for the stream.

3334
03:52:16,970 --> 03:52:17,730
Thank you!

3335
03:52:18,490 --> 03:52:21,310
By the way, there is a YouTube teaser showing a 3D Metal Gear Solid 3.

3336
03:52:21,570 --> 03:52:22,850
Oh, sorry, Merry Gear Solid 3.

3337
03:52:22,910 --> 03:52:25,930
With interesting ideas, but that didn't get made, so...

3338
03:52:26,650 --> 03:52:28,050
Up to you if you want to watch it.

3339
03:52:29,290 --> 03:52:30,690
How long ago is it from?

3340
03:52:31,630 --> 03:52:32,550
Thanks for getting through the game.

3341
03:52:32,610 --> 03:52:33,510
Sorry about all the backtracking.

3342
03:52:33,630 --> 03:52:34,530
No, it's okay!

3343
03:52:36,310 --> 03:52:37,110
Merry Christmas.

3344
03:52:38,450 --> 03:52:42,490
Thank you so much, Mr. Podunkian.

3345
03:52:42,590 --> 03:52:43,410
Is that how you say it?

3346
03:52:43,830 --> 03:52:45,210
Thank you for watching.

3347
03:52:45,950 --> 03:52:47,750
I had so much fun.

3348
03:52:47,930 --> 03:52:48,370
Wow.

3349
03:52:50,450 --> 03:52:50,890
Wow.

3350
03:52:51,550 --> 03:52:52,810
Shame we'll never get a third game.

3351
03:52:53,550 --> 03:52:55,930
We need more games like the classic Metal Gear games.

3352
03:52:56,110 --> 03:52:58,490
Tiny Metal was a little too hammy for my...

3353
03:52:58,490 --> 03:52:59,610
I don't know Tiny Metal.

3354
03:53:00,430 --> 03:53:01,910
Do you know any other games like this?

3355
03:53:02,290 --> 03:53:03,230
Have you played Unmetal?

3356
03:53:03,230 --> 03:53:03,970
Unmetal?

3357
03:53:06,890 --> 03:53:09,230
Unmetal is also...

3358
03:53:09,230 --> 03:53:10,070
You know.

3359
03:53:11,850 --> 03:53:17,250
There were some things in Unmetal that I obviously had criticism about.

3360
03:53:17,390 --> 03:53:19,190
But overall I think it was a lot of fun.

3361
03:53:25,600 --> 03:53:27,360
What was actually in the zip file?

3362
03:53:27,520 --> 03:53:28,380
Oh yeah, let me see.

3363
03:53:29,220 --> 03:53:31,520
It says sleepgrenade.txt

3364
03:53:34,580 --> 03:53:42,420
That's what was in package.zip Was sleepgrenade.txt Wait, let me see if I open it.

3365
03:53:42,480 --> 03:53:43,280
What does it say?

3366
03:53:44,180 --> 03:53:44,640
Sleepgrenade.

3367
03:53:45,260 --> 03:53:46,380
That's all it says.

3368
03:53:50,080 --> 03:53:51,000
So good.

3369
03:53:51,740 --> 03:53:53,040
So much fun.

3370
03:53:53,220 --> 03:53:54,240
That's so awesome.

3371
03:53:55,320 --> 03:53:56,800
Oh my gosh, that's so awesome.

3372
03:54:02,300 --> 03:54:04,560
I also noticed there was a soft restart.

3373
03:54:04,760 --> 03:54:06,480
Maybe I should have done that when it was...

3374
03:54:06,480 --> 03:54:07,680
Oh, I see!

3375
03:54:07,800 --> 03:54:08,420
Oh my gosh!

3376
03:54:08,540 --> 03:54:09,160
Oh my gosh.

3377
03:54:09,900 --> 03:54:11,240
I literally see you, Arthur.

3378
03:54:11,780 --> 03:54:12,820
In the readme.

3379
03:54:13,400 --> 03:54:16,340
I see your gmail.

3380
03:54:18,500 --> 03:54:19,380
Super nostalgic.

3381
03:54:19,540 --> 03:54:20,540
Played these when I was a kid.

3382
03:54:20,640 --> 03:54:21,240
No way!

3383
03:54:23,080 --> 03:54:24,500
That was so much fun.

3384
03:54:27,440 --> 03:54:28,900
Thank you guys for watching.

3385
03:54:29,040 --> 03:54:31,420
And I hope this was a good way to...

3386
03:54:31,420 --> 03:54:33,460
A good...

3387
03:54:33,460 --> 03:54:34,980
Silly way...

3388
03:54:34,980 --> 03:54:37,940
To have the Christmas cheer.

3389
03:54:39,120 --> 03:54:40,480
And be all festive.

3390
03:54:41,280 --> 03:54:42,260
That was so much fun.

3391
03:54:43,920 --> 03:54:46,000
That was so much fun!

3392
03:54:49,620 --> 03:54:51,260
I'm super duper hungry.

3393
03:54:51,420 --> 03:54:53,700
I didn't have dinner yet, so...

3394
03:54:53,700 --> 03:54:55,340
I'm really, really hungry.

3395
03:54:55,600 --> 03:54:57,140
So I think I'm gonna hop off here.

3396
03:54:57,960 --> 03:55:00,700
But I'm glad you guys enjoyed.

3397
03:55:07,270 --> 03:55:07,790
Ding!

3398
03:55:07,890 --> 03:55:08,590
Fries are done!

3399
03:55:08,710 --> 03:55:08,890
Ding!

3400
03:55:09,030 --> 03:55:09,650
Fries are done!

3401
03:55:09,830 --> 03:55:10,010
Ding!

3402
03:55:10,170 --> 03:55:10,770
Fries are done!

3403
03:55:13,150 --> 03:55:15,010
Yeah, thank you guys!

3404
03:55:15,550 --> 03:55:19,150
I have another stream tomorrow.

3405
03:55:19,410 --> 03:55:21,150
And then I'll be gone for a week and a half.

3406
03:55:21,410 --> 03:55:22,030
In Japan.

3407
03:55:22,790 --> 03:55:25,050
I don't plan to stream while I'm over there.

3408
03:55:26,350 --> 03:55:28,050
Maybe do like a...

3409
03:55:28,050 --> 03:55:30,430
Twitter space or something for New Year's, but...

3410
03:55:31,410 --> 03:55:33,010
I don't plan on bringing my computer.

3411
03:55:34,770 --> 03:55:36,570
Since it's a bit of a hassle.

3412
03:55:37,210 --> 03:55:40,090
And I would only want to stream for New Year's, I think.

3413
03:55:41,410 --> 03:55:44,250
But I don't really want to bring my whole laptop and all my stuff.

3414
03:55:44,510 --> 03:55:45,490
Just for one stream.

3415
03:55:45,590 --> 03:55:46,630
I hope you guys understand.

3416
03:55:47,470 --> 03:55:48,130
Self-deserve!

3417
03:55:48,590 --> 03:55:50,090
Thank you for the super chat!

3418
03:55:50,690 --> 03:55:52,690
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas!

3419
03:55:57,290 --> 03:55:57,730
So...

3420
03:55:57,730 --> 03:56:02,170
It's like so heavy and it's so much stuff that I have to put in my carry-on.

3421
03:56:02,230 --> 03:56:04,410
Because I can't put it in my suitcase.

3422
03:56:04,410 --> 03:56:07,850
And so it's like...

3423
03:56:08,630 --> 03:56:10,010
It's like such a hassle.

3424
03:56:11,370 --> 03:56:13,170
Minto's taking an actual real vacation.

3425
03:56:13,290 --> 03:56:13,790
Let's go.

3426
03:56:15,670 --> 03:56:16,430
Stop it!

3427
03:56:17,170 --> 03:56:18,110
Why are you cheering that?

3428
03:56:18,170 --> 03:56:19,170
Won't you miss me?

3429
03:56:21,370 --> 03:56:22,670
You're not gonna miss me?

3430
03:56:28,340 --> 03:56:29,620
Merry Christmas, Minto.

3431
03:56:29,900 --> 03:56:31,660
Wishing you and the Wisps a lovely day.

3432
03:56:31,800 --> 03:56:35,700
Whether you celebrate or not, I hope you all treat yourselves to wonderful things today.

3433
03:56:35,700 --> 03:56:36,920
Thanks, Tri Princess!

3434
03:56:39,480 --> 03:56:40,700
Of course we will.

3435
03:56:41,220 --> 03:56:42,040
Maybe a little.

3436
03:56:48,110 --> 03:56:49,950
My heart won't be able to take it.

3437
03:56:52,930 --> 03:56:55,370
But we still have tomorrow, so...

3438
03:56:58,290 --> 03:56:59,250
No worries.

3439
03:57:01,930 --> 03:57:02,410
Otsumita!

3440
03:57:03,350 --> 03:57:04,710
Thank you for the funny Christmas stream.

3441
03:57:04,930 --> 03:57:05,470
Enjoy your trip.

3442
03:57:05,550 --> 03:57:06,110
Thank you!

3443
03:57:06,350 --> 03:57:07,730
Minto's taking an actual real vacation.

3444
03:57:07,910 --> 03:57:08,250
Let's go.

3445
03:57:11,470 --> 03:57:12,290
We'll miss you.

3446
03:57:12,330 --> 03:57:13,330
Have a great vacation, Minto.

3447
03:57:13,570 --> 03:57:14,370
Thank you!

3448
03:57:15,270 --> 03:57:16,330
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3449
03:57:17,770 --> 03:57:21,370
But things are only going to ramp up next year, so...

3450
03:57:21,890 --> 03:57:22,370
Brighton!

3451
03:57:22,770 --> 03:57:23,130
Welcome back!

3452
03:57:23,390 --> 03:57:24,850
Thank you for the off-stream.

3453
03:57:25,230 --> 03:57:26,350
Don't know, I saw it.

3454
03:57:26,410 --> 03:57:27,130
Thank you!

3455
03:57:27,690 --> 03:57:28,530
Thank you so much.

3456
03:57:28,710 --> 03:57:29,790
Really appreciate it.

3457
03:57:31,570 --> 03:57:34,090
We'll miss you, but you deserve the vacation.

3458
03:57:34,450 --> 03:57:36,150
I don't even deserve it that much.

3459
03:57:36,410 --> 03:57:38,090
You guys, all I do is stream.

3460
03:57:38,350 --> 03:57:38,950
It's fine.

3461
03:57:39,370 --> 03:57:40,730
I really don't.

3462
03:57:42,050 --> 03:57:43,170
I feel bad.

3463
03:57:43,630 --> 03:57:44,870
I stream.

3464
03:57:46,910 --> 03:57:48,690
I have the easiest job ever.

3465
03:57:53,940 --> 03:57:54,960
It's fine.

3466
03:58:04,670 --> 03:58:06,490
Personal time is important too.

3467
03:58:07,030 --> 03:58:09,250
Well, I have lots of stories to talk about, hopefully.

3468
03:58:09,710 --> 03:58:15,890
I'll go to many maid cafes and I'll tell you guys lots of stuff about Comiket and everything and everything.

3469
03:58:15,890 --> 03:58:20,050
But like I said, we still have tomorrow, so we'll get to talk lots and lots tomorrow instead.

3470
03:58:20,210 --> 03:58:22,430
So stop acting like I'm leaving tonight, okay?

3471
03:58:25,470 --> 03:58:26,430
Otsumito, everybody!

3472
03:58:27,950 --> 03:58:29,070
Merry Christmas!

3473
03:58:32,650 --> 03:58:36,350
I hope you guys had lots of fun today.

3474
03:58:36,690 --> 03:58:43,190
Hopefully you guys got to enjoy lots of all the Christmas activities that people have been streaming all over.

3475
03:58:43,190 --> 03:58:49,790
And hopefully, if you didn't spend it with family, you got to spend it with friends.

3476
03:58:50,150 --> 03:58:54,910
Or you got to spend it with us, which is still awesome.

3477
03:58:55,330 --> 03:58:57,350
And you got to at least rest, hopefully.

3478
03:58:57,510 --> 03:58:58,610
Hopefully you didn't have to work.

3479
03:58:59,210 --> 03:59:01,710
And if you did have to work, please get some rest.

3480
03:59:04,670 --> 03:59:05,110
Otsumito!

3481
03:59:05,730 --> 03:59:06,750
I spent it with Vtubers.

3482
03:59:08,630 --> 03:59:10,810
That's why I try to stream on holidays.

3483
03:59:11,010 --> 03:59:15,770
Because I know not everybody can be with somebody.

3484
03:59:16,190 --> 03:59:17,870
So you can be here.

3485
03:59:18,210 --> 03:59:18,830
You're with us.

3486
03:59:19,230 --> 03:59:19,850
You're hanging out.

3487
03:59:22,130 --> 03:59:23,350
We're all hanging out.

3488
03:59:27,210 --> 03:59:28,410
I miss Mint.

3489
03:59:28,530 --> 03:59:29,650
I'm right here.

3490
03:59:33,130 --> 03:59:35,090
Otsumito, get some rest.

3491
03:59:35,210 --> 03:59:35,910
Get some good food.

3492
03:59:35,910 --> 03:59:37,830
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3493
03:59:38,050 --> 03:59:39,790
Or when I see you, see you next.

3494
03:59:40,330 --> 03:59:41,070
Bye bye!

3495
04:00:09,180 --> 04:00:10,720
My stream deck is not working.

3496
04:00:11,340 --> 04:00:11,860
What's happening?

3497
04:00:12,300 --> 04:00:12,940
Everything is breaking.

3498
04:00:13,380 --> 04:00:13,760
OK, bye.
