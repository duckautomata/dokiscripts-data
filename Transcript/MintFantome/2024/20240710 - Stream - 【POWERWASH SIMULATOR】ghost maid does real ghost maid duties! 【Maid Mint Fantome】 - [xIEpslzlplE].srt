1
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,760
Chewing Minto.

2
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,340
I'm eating tacos.

3
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,680
One second.

4
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,200
I just got finished recording the podcast episode with Matara.

5
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,900
More hammer episode?

6
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,140
No, that's the next one.

7
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,540
Let the bodies hit the floor?

8
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,640
Oh shoot, I just realized.

9
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,020
I didn't have BGM even though I had it on.

10
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:30,940
Andragas!

11
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,140
Thanks for the 20 gifted.

12
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,400
Thank you!

13
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,020
She told you to do the Warhammer DLC?

14
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,020
Actually, she told me not to do it.

15
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,920
She said, all you'll be doing is cleaning tanks.

16
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,240
And I was like, I like tanks.

17
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,100
But I have a different one I wanted to do.

18
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,520
I hope it's okay.

19
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,520
I have a different one I wanted to do.

20
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,200
Hold on.

21
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,420
I'm finishing my tacos.

22
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,180
Arigato!

23
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,360
Arigato!

24
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,560
Arigato!

25
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,180
Chuu!

26
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,180
Chuu!

27
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,220
And then I'll properly greet you.

28
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,140
You guys came in early.

29
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,900
On my off time.

30
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,600
You know?

31
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,040
So, uh, I'll...

32
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,890
Oh no!

33
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,030
My taco!

34
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,550
Don't go back from your virtual vacation!

35
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,950
Thank you!

36
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,050
Ow.

37
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,550
Cleansed of your sin?

38
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,850
I think you're at the wrong place.

39
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,070
Seven taco?

40
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,730
No, just one taco.

41
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,570
Why would I get seven... who eats seven tacos?

42
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,060
Hot dog.

43
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,340
I should have gotten a hot dog instead.

44
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,200
Donk!

45
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,540
Don't judge.

46
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,640
Okay.

47
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,440
I think I'd probably eat seven.

48
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,420
Tacos are good though.

49
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,760
It's taco long.

50
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,700
To eat seven?

51
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,720
Thank you for the tacos!

52
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,660
Love your performance.

53
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,840
Thank you!

54
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,000
Lost my voice and pulled a muscle.

55
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,660
Oh shit.

56
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,540
No!

57
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,060
Hold on.

58
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,800
I'll finish reading it.

59
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,380
I hope to see you perform again.

60
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,020
Thank you!

61
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,600
Thank you so much!

62
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,460
Thank you so much!

63
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,280
Sounding cheery today?

64
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,240
I'm Santa Claus.

65
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,120
Old statement.

66
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,300
What if they had MGS DLC so you could clean Rex Ray?

67
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,530
Wait.

68
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,490
I was gonna say, why haven't they done it already?

69
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,270
You did Final Fantasy but Power Wash Simulator is technically a square.

70
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,510
So it makes sense.

71
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,190
Flying for work.

72
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:51,750
Work?

73
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,850
Last time I watched your stream before a flight, I missed it.

74
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:56,810
Oh gosh.

75
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,130
No!

76
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:57,930
You gotta make it!

77
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,010
Okay, this is the last plot.

78
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,710
But yeah, they should do that.

79
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,670
Konami, please.

80
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,050
Allow them to make me...

81
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,070
Allow me to bathe Rex Ray.

82
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,250
Rex Ray.

83
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,390
Yeah!

84
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,290
For fuck's sake!

85
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,450
Just wanna say as a new viewer who has only been watching since your return.

86
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,390
You're now one of my absolute favorite streamers.

87
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,410
You're so funny and passionate.

88
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,310
Thanks for being awesome!

89
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,330
Thank you!

90
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,610
Thank you so much!

91
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,450
Thank you!

92
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,070
Goodbye.

93
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:42,690
Taco.

94
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,690
Would you Power Wash Snake's snake?

95
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,790
I'll take a Power Wash and...

96
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,350
I'll take a Power Wash and...

97
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,030
Go like all over the animals.

98
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:53,570
Go like all over the animals.

99
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,550
The Crock Hat.

100
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,780
I want tacos.

101
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,420
Me too.

102
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,000
I just had two of them.

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,640
Oh.

104
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,740
Sorry.

105
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,940
We're starting the stream now.

106
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,420
Welcome back!

107
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,980
Welcome everybody!

108
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,640
I'm Minto!

109
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,170
Welcome to Power Wash Simulator!

110
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,950
I'm Chibi Minto again today because...

111
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,770
I'm small.

112
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,110
Small brain.

113
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,410
For the game.

114
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,950
Also I thought that this one...

115
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,770
That uh...

116
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,670
This look would kind of fit the DLC that I wanted to do.

117
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,250
So!

118
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,460
I'm gonna play...

119
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,850
Oh it's kind of loud.

120
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,090
Hold on.

121
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,250
Woo!

122
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:52,730
Oh!

123
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,690
Oh!

124
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,820
Yeah.

125
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,120
Oh.

126
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,720
Too low.

127
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,590
Fortnite?

128
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,030
No way there's a Fortnite map in this.

129
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,870
Is there really?

130
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,130
Is there really?

131
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,950
Don't lie to me.

132
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,770
We could go to Potato Town?

133
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,780
Which one do you think I chose?

134
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,580
Oh wait.

135
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,600
You can't see my big head.

136
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,500
Oh that's the Steam Store page on the bottom right.

137
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,280
Wait!

138
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,960
I forgot about the Tomb Raider one!

139
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,020
Seasonal?

140
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,500
Free seasonally themed jobs.

141
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,520
Spongebob!

142
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,240
Spongebob!

143
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,200
Spongebob!

144
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,040
Let's go to...

145
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,320
Spongebob!

146
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,280
Spongebob!

147
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,640
Wait the Tomb Raider one seems so fun.

148
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,600
Completely forgot about it.

149
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,880
As always.

150
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,660
How's the audio by the way?

151
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,900
Yeah.

152
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,820
Conch Street!

153
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,420
Arigato Arigato Chuu!

154
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,440
It is.

155
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,040
It is.

156
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,520
It is.

157
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:24,960
It is.

158
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,700
It IS a power washer!

159
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,600
Boy are we glad you're here!

160
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,940
Why is there house so gross!?

161
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,940
Oh gosh, wait, I don't remember how to play this game.

162
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,460
I'm in Bikini Bottom!

163
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,900
Oh my god!

164
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,340
I'm in Bikini Bo- I'm in Bikini Bottom!

165
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,170
Oh!

166
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,110
Patrick?

167
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,570
What happened to your place in particular?

168
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,330
He's dead!

169
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,920
Patrick!

170
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,830
He's dead!

171
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,130
He's dead!

172
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,110
He's gone!

173
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,430
He's been reduced to atoms!

174
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,630
Patrick!

175
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,780
Anyway...

176
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,360
Oh my god!

177
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,920
I think the dirt came here because it wanted to.

178
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,460
Thanks, Patrick.

179
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,700
Oh my god!

180
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:57,720
Oh my god!

181
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,480
Oh, water volume.

182
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,540
Let's take that down just a little bit, you know?

183
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,280
And you gotta clean the crime scene.

184
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,780
How's that?

185
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,160
How's that for volume mixing for me and for the game?

186
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,360
Let me know how you think, guys.

187
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,920
Let me know.

188
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,720
Not louder?

189
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,240
It's good?

190
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,840
Can you still hear the music?

191
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,900
Why am I power washing underwater?

192
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,600
Goodbye, Patrick Star.

193
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,120
You can?

194
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:42,680
Okay.

195
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,700
Music's good?

196
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,580
Thanks, guys.

197
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,860
Look at that.

198
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,060
We're getting it all.

199
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,780
Wait, I messed up this.

200
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,400
There we go.

201
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,180
Oh, yeah.

202
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,020
And her.

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,660
This walkway will be the cleanest thing.

204
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,030
Since...

205
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,130
Whoa!

206
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,810
SpongeBob real!

207
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,790
Thank you!

208
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,370
Putting my money where my mouth is after yesterday's stream.

209
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,200
Keep your desire to do right by us at the forefront of your heart.

210
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,440
And you will always have the love and support of the Wisp.

211
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,900
Don't overdo it, though.

212
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,980
We want to be happy and healthy.

213
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,480
Thank you!

214
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,400
Thank you so much!

215
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,010
Arigato.

216
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:43,830
Arigato.

217
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,530
Chew.

218
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,310
Hahaha.

219
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,610
Wait, we can open this house.

220
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,490
I'm coming.

221
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,110
Yes!

222
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,130
Oh, my God.

223
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,050
Patrick Star.

224
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:02,510
Stop.

225
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,270
Oh, what has happened here?

226
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,590
Polly, thank you for the five gifted.

227
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,060
Straight through them.

228
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,720
Straight through them.

229
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,000
Can I go inside their houses?

230
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,940
Wait, that means there's going to be a...

231
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,140
Wait.

232
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,120
No, I can't go inside of Squidward.

233
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,620
Oh, my gosh.

234
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:32,900
Look.

235
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,560
Wait, how do I rotate like that?

236
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:34,760
Yeah.

237
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,420
Bubbles!

238
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,000
Baby.

239
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,160
Lemurs.

240
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,420
25 cents.

241
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,940
Hayden, thanks for the five gifted.

242
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,120
Thank you.

243
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,420
Patrick ate too many tacos.

244
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,120
I like the bubble sounds that you can hear.

245
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,920
What is this up here?

246
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,640
What's up here?

247
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
Doesn't look dirty at all.

248
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,500
What's up here?

249
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,940
Oh, is it to jump?

250
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,480
Maybe to get up top?

251
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,660
Nice view.

252
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,040
You're my best view.

253
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,220
I made it!

254
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,780
I made it!

255
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,360
Oh my god!

256
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:30,880
Get me!

257
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,100
I'm gonna make it in!

258
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,200
I'm gonna make it!

259
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:34,600
Oh come on!

260
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,520
Get up there!

261
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,760
Get up there!

262
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,380
Oh, I thought I could... I thought I would fall.

263
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,740
I think it's possible.

264
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,180
Do not forget to bring it around down.

265
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,580
I came here to get... I came here to watch Mint get washed.

266
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,060
I'm gonna wash your mouth out.

267
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
That's what I'm gonna do.

268
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,430
Wait, I should have written my own sign.

269
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,730
We'll write it here.

270
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,930
What's the Charlie Brown one?

271
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,510
Hold on.

272
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,510
How do I switch nozzles?

273
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,730
To the really thin one.

274
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,890
This one?

275
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,670
Yeah, okay.

276
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:32,810
Oh!

277
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,890
It's still too thick.

278
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,130
Therapy.

279
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,850
The doctor is in.

280
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,640
I'm thirsty.

281
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,620
Can I get a quick hit?

282
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,400
The doctor!

283
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,620
Oh wait, hold on.

284
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,160
Doctor!

285
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,540
Doctor!

286
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,420
I have a problem!

287
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,700
Doctor!

288
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,180
Doctor!

289
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:31,780
Doctor!

290
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,280
Doctor!

291
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,080
I have a problem!

292
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,700
Five cents.

293
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,120
Oh.

294
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,380
Can I write you an IOU?

295
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,020
Yes.

296
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:43,920
Doctor!

297
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,200
Doctor!

298
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,300
What does it mean to be in love?

299
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,580
Doctor!

300
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,600
Doctor!

301
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,940
How do I know?

302
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
How do I know if I'm in love?

303
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,740
And also, doctor...

304
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,740
It kind of hurts when I pee a little.

305
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,460
What do I do?

306
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,680
Is that related to love?

307
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,440
Left click, you all!

308
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,180
Oh!

309
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,480
Oh!

310
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,920
Wait.

311
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,780
Let me scoot over a little bit.

312
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:32,900
Wait.

313
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,300
Oh, wait.

314
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:34,660
Hold on.

315
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,980
You're upstream!

316
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,630
Just got back from AXO.

317
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,750
Finally able to catch the stream again.

318
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,610
I hope you had fun!

319
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,210
I hope to see you perform more in future!

320
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,750
You're made for the strange.

321
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,430
Thanks, doll.

322
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,630
I was just telling Matara about that.

323
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:06,930
How

324
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,260
can I make it shoot me?

325
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,620
Oh, hold on.

326
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:33,960
Hold on.

327
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,680
What's the shower one?

328
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,800
This one, right?

329
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,420
I'm getting all...

330
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,560
I'm getting a real...

331
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,720
real bubble bath here.

332
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,620
Mint is a crosshair?

333
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,040
Like, if I clean something?

334
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,740
It's just me.

335
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,580
I'm just like wiping my...

336
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,220
I'm cleaning with my whole body!

337
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,300
Like I'm a...

338
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,780
Like I'm a damn sponge!

339
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,680
SpongeBob's house will be cleaned by my own hands.

340
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,460
Mop Phantom!

341
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,050
Okay, I'll move.

342
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:31,670
I'll move back.

343
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,270
That was pretty good.

344
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,130
Mop Phantom.

345
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,120
Okay.

346
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,180
I never got an answer, though.

347
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,560
Could be holy water?

348
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,560
That won't affect me.

349
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,200
I'm not evil.

350
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,880
Holy water is fine.

351
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,840
It's only for like demons and stuff.

352
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,400
I mean, don't bring it to the party or anything, but...

353
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,760
I'm no baby.

354
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,220
We used to do that as like, you know, in school.

355
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,040
Be like, huh?

356
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,120
You're gonna drink that...

357
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,940
You're gonna drink the holy water?

358
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,960
Be like a...

359
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,240
Like a tradition.

360
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,700
A hazing thing, you know?

361
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,220
Sorry I missed you at AX.

362
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,540
But I did find a very shy mint cosplayer.

363
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,540
Did he take a picture?

364
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,080
What happened here?

365
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,100
Why is it like this?

366
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,280
Why is it like this color?

367
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,950
Oh!

368
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,070
Each individual stone is...

369
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,830
Why?

370
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,230
Why am I getting paid per stone?

371
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,010
Gary?

372
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,490
Oh!

373
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,170
It's probably Gary!

374
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:52,430
Gary!

375
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:54,830
Yeah...

376
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,550
It's Gary.

377
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,270
You're right.

378
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:57,870
You're right.

379
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,310
You're right.

380
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,010
So that's Gary too, right?

381
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,190
Cha-ching!

382
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,790
Cha-ching!

383
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,150
Oh!

384
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,490
There's more Gary!

385
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,430
Oh!

386
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,450
It's disgusting.

387
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,170
What is this?

388
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,210
A garage?

389
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,050
This guy has no car, but he has a garage?

390
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,530
Can I see inside?

391
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,410
Let me in, Squidward.

392
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,260
YouTube isn't letting me become a member.

393
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,180
Does anyone know why?

394
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,220
I have no idea.

395
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,380
YouTube!

396
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,120
Stop bullying!

397
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,600
How do you want to brain so much?

398
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,520
We could deem you...

399
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,200
Mint-ingitis.

400
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,060
So if you hit C, it'll help you avoid the motion sickness.

401
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:08,760
Oh!

402
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,640
Thank you!

403
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,200
I actually don't really get motion sick from this game, but that's a good thing for other people watching.

404
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:14,720
Thank you.

405
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,680
I forgot about that setting.

406
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,800
Murphy!

407
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,420
Thanks for the five, Gifton.

408
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,720
He does have a car?

409
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,800
He goes to driving...

410
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,060
Well, he can't drive the car.

411
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,400
He does not have a license.

412
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,740
That's the point of school.

413
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,800
Cleaning up all this slime.

414
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,340
What if Gary was like a... slime girl?

415
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,560
Oh, wait.

416
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,240
There.

417
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:44,680
That's right.

418
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,540
Why did it switch?

419
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:46,940
I wonder.

420
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,440
There we go.

421
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:56,930
Wait.

422
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,090
What did I...

423
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:04,930
Is each individual... thing... got to get cleaned?

424
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,550
Oh my gosh!

425
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,470
A panel!

426
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,780
Each individual tiny panel must be scrubbed down.

427
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,260
Oh my gosh!

428
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,000
Which one have I missed?

429
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,720
Nice.

430
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,820
Yeah, I was telling Matara earlier.

431
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,120
I was just like...

432
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,880
I don't know how I feel so much about performing...

433
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,400
like...

434
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,560
so...

435
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,760
you know...

436
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,300
at the actual place.

437
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,700
Because it made me so much more nervous than...

438
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,420
than if I were at home and singing, you know.

439
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,860
I mean, I'm digital.

440
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,660
I have that...

441
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,380
I have that ability...

442
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,300
to just stay home and...

443
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,420
But it was really...

444
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,800
it was quite nerve-wracking.

445
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,660
I'll be honest.

446
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,260
I was shaking like a little baby...

447
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,300
like a little Chihuahua.

448
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,700
I was like...

449
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,100
Ow!

450
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:17,740
Ow!

451
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,160
Ow!

452
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,580
Ow!

453
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,000
I could barely even read my lyrics.

454
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,720
Lost in the story.

455
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,160
Thanks for the...

456
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,000
Why is everybody gifted?

457
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,940
Thank you for the tag gifted.

458
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:27,620
Sayakae.

459
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,440
Thanks for the fan gift.

460
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,520
Chihuahuas are cute.

461
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,680
How about that?

462
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,800
Rainbow!

463
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,220
Thanks for the tag!

464
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,840
Thank you!

465
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,860
Captain, thank you!

466
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,620
No biting.

467
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,440
I'm not just all bark and no bite in here.

468
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,280
I took my dog to an appointment today.

469
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,320
I hope it was a good appointment.

470
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,960
I hope it was...

471
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,480
Look how clean this is so far!

472
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,540
Nice.

473
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,660
C2!

474
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:17,880
CC?

475
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,140
Thanks for the five, thank you!

476
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,240
I was wondering that yesterday, if it was C2 or CC.

477
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:24,820
Help!

478
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,620
It's thanks for the five!

479
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,140
Nice.

480
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,520
Nice.

481
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,580
There has to be more.

482
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,980
I don't think the door itself got cleaned.

483
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,740
Bubbles and therapy.

484
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,780
The best combo.

485
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,940
Way to be!

486
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,360
Fifty!

487
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,700
Thanks for the ten!

488
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,180
Fifty MT!

489
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,700
Thank you for the five!

490
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,320
T-card!

491
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,460
Thanks for the five!

492
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,520
Mint-wawa.

493
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,860
Not!

494
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,360
Mint-wawa.

495
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:00,660
Wait.

496
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:02,900
Not!

497
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,000
That didn't work.

498
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,080
Asshole, thank you for the aqua super.

499
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
Arigato, arigato.

500
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,680
Thank you!

501
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,900
Thanks for all.

502
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,500
To all that are gifting membership.

503
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,780
I think I can't buy one member for how cheap it is in IR.

504
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,040
Is that why?

505
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,310
I just heard a cat.

506
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,830
Did I hear Gary?

507
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,630
It wasn't my cat.

508
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,390
What?

509
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,640
She's not mint-wawa.

510
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,740
She's mint-o...

511
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:54,860
Mintobo?

512
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,340
I think I heard Gary real.

513
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,700
I heard meow.

514
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,250
You hear it?

515
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:10,290
Gary!

516
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,550
Are you trapped in there?

517
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,840
You heard it, right?

518
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,460
I don't think Gary likes noise.

519
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,230
I thought the SpongeBob one would be kind of fun though to do.

520
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,370
Since it's, you know...

521
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,590
Everybody knows and loves SpongeBabe.

522
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,150
Mmm.

523
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,170
The Minto washing FreakBobs out.

524
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,250
SpunkBob.

525
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,090
Yeah, exactly.

526
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,910
How do I clean this thing?

527
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,420
I'm crawling literally on the ground for this.

528
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,800
I got it!

529
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,500
The Reef Blower.

530
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,840
Oh my gosh.

531
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,600
There's so many...

532
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,640
I stole!

533
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,800
Thanks for the 10 Gifted!

534
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,000
Thank you guys!

535
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,240
She's a maid and she does pressured water cleaning.

536
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,700
While under the sea, this ghost can do it all.

537
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,720
Under the sea...

538
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,340
Under the sea...

539
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,360
Darling, it's better down...

540
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,860
Down where it's wetter, take it from me...

541
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,300
Take it from me, me, me...

542
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,500
Woah!

543
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,480
Up on the shore they slave away...

544
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,300
Something here they start to play...

545
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,580
Full time devoting under the sea...

546
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,300
Under the sea...

547
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,640
Darling, it's better down where it's wetter, take it from me...

548
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,240
Take it from me, me, me...

549
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,540
Even the surgeon and the ray...

550
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,320
They get the urge to start to play...

551
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,090
Under the sea...

552
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,310
Full time devoting...

553
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,990
Under the sea...

554
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:31,210
We don't drink our pee?

555
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,670
That's not the lyrics.

556
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,030
Why would you do that?

557
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:34,890
Naturally?

558
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,210
No...

559
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,780
Oh my gosh, I should draw something!

560
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,600
I'm gonna draw...

561
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,120
Okay, hold on...

562
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,320
I did the window...

563
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,240
But since this is a big ol' face...

564
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:03,230
We can make the eyes kinda like...

565
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,190
He's like...

566
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,610
And then, on the back...

567
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,530
Come on, come on...

568
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,130
A big ol' behind...

569
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,870
Them cheeks...

570
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,500
Them cheeks...

571
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,520
Cheeked up...

572
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,300
What about this one?

573
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,920
We can turn it into...

574
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,580
A boob...

575
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,640
Bikini bottom, everybody...

576
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,040
Bikini bottom...

577
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,700
Bikini bottom...

578
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,210
A boob...?

579
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,370
No...

580
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:10,630
Ah...

581
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,030
Ah...

582
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:23,620
Where is it, and I can turn it into...

583
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,740
Already.

584
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,780
Wow.

585
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,480
I think, I did it just fine...

586
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:30,840
I even cut you...

587
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,720
And the guy's coming at me...

588
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,940
Hayır, nein Ü fellow Befren...

589
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,300
Freak Bob Dun Normal ist das.

590
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,140
Wait, what's left of it?

591
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,960
Just a box.

592
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,800
The imagination box!

593
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,380
And I'd want you to live right down the way.

594
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,080
Aww, they're such besties.

595
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Imagination box.

596
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,720
I want in there.

597
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,990
Days since last MGS.

598
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,680
It wasn't me, it was Spongebob!

599
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,420
I wonder what else... it can't just be these three houses, right?

600
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,380
The DLC was eight bucks.

601
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,280
There's more here, right?

602
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,730
There's more?

603
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:43,270
Okay.

604
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,230
Oh, there's another stage?

605
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:44,730
Okay, good.

606
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:46,810
I feel like...

607
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,950
You can't even go into most of the places.

608
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:51,970
No.

609
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,710
Who wrote that?

610
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,350
Vandalism.

611
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,770
Spongebob is a Metal Gear reference?

612
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,670
I have to imagine that it was a Metal Gear reference.

613
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,810
There's no way it wasn't.

614
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:12,010
You don't just say a cardboard box and mean it in a normal, average way.

615
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:16,790
You don't just say a

616
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:26,990
cardboard box and mean it in a normal, average way.

617
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,170
Brain rot.

618
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,970
That's what I'm saying.

619
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,560
You guys, did you see the news?

620
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,020
Did you see the big news?

621
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,620
The big five news!

622
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,200
Big five news!

623
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,960
Shrek 5.

624
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,360
Shrek 5 next year!

625
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:57,770
Shrek!

626
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,050
Shrek 5 next year!

627
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,190
Shrek 5 next year!

628
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:02,610
Yeah!

629
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,890
With... with... with Mike...

630
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,310
Michael Myers.

631
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,290
Isn't that the serial killer?

632
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,310
With him!

633
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,870
Yeah, baby.

634
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,530
And Eddie Murphy.

635
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,150
I don't know who else is coming back.

636
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,280
Mike Wazowski.

637
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:31,540
No!

638
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,560
He's a serial killer and an actor!

639
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,680
Oh my gosh!

640
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,320
Just hide in plain sight!

641
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,800
It's the easiest way!

642
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,340
Oh, sorry.

643
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,600
I keep forgetting about the motion sickness mode.

644
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,240
I don't know why it turns off.

645
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,400
I think it turns off every time I crouch.

646
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,440
Or run.

647
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,240
Or play the game.

648
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,320
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

649
00:36:59,380 --> 00:36:59,920
Thank you!

650
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,480
What if Mint is in Shrek 5?

651
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,240
Yeah, that's how I knew it was coming out.

652
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,140
I'm in it.

653
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,940
And they didn't ask me to sign an NDA.

654
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,000
It actually hasn't even been announced.

655
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,580
You're welcome.

656
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
They asked if I could announce it on my channel.

657
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,320
I said, you know, Mint.

658
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,400
The world will be looking at you as soon as you start stream.

659
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,380
The world will be looking at you as soon as you start stream.

660
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,220
Could you say it?

661
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,460
Could you do us a small favor?

662
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,240
Could you?

663
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
Actually, a huge favor.

664
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,120
Because, you know.

665
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,600
We're indie studio Dreamworks.

666
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,890
Guys, I'm Shrek.

667
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,730
They asked me if I could voice Shrek.

668
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,390
Oh, God.

669
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,290
Mint is actually Eddie Murphy.

670
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,750
If you don't believe me, ask me to say something anything Shrek would say.

671
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,530
If you don't believe me, ask me to say something anything Shrek would say.

672
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,830
And also, if you want something in the movie, tell me now.

673
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,370
We'll have it put in.

674
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,480
Donkey.

675
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,360
Donkey, donkey, donkey.

676
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,800
Can you put Jerma in the movie?

677
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,500
It's kind of exclusive, you know.

678
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,820
You have to be somebody to be in the movie.

679
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,860
I'll see if they'll pity this poor indie creator, you know.

680
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,540
Are you going to make waffles with Donkey?

681
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,080
Are you going to make waffles with Donkey?

682
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:45,980
Yeah.

683
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,720
Do the roar?

684
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,090
Hold on, I gotta get some high ground here.

685
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,400
It'll sound better in post with like, you know.

686
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,040
Reverb.

687
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,700
Everything like that.

688
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,420
So if you're just like, it's not like what I remember.

689
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:49,860
Don't worry.

690
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,880
It'll sound better.

691
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,560
When they really get to it, you know.

692
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,360
I'm a little sore from all the recording.

693
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,260
And stuff.

694
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,900
Roar with a lowercase a?

695
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,460
Never!

696
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,080
I only roar with capital.

697
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,600
A.

698
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,840
Oh no, I can't stop thinking of the Hunger Games.

699
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:22,300
I watched so much of the Hunger Games on the plane ride.

700
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:22,760
I watched so much of the Hunger Games on the plane ride.

701
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,060
There?

702
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,400
And back?

703
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,220
I watched so much Hunger Games.

704
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,600
I was like, I don't think I've ever finished the Hunger Games.

705
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,380
I was being so...

706
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,460
Oh my gosh, it was so embarrassing.

707
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,380
I was like crying.

708
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,480
I was like crying over the Hunger Games.

709
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,860
On the plane.

710
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,860
It's so embarrassing.

711
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,320
The worst place to cry over a movie is on a plane.

712
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,680
Who won the Hunger Games?

713
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,700
Does anybody win the Hunger Games?

714
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,480
Which one?

715
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,820
I watched all of them.

716
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,860
But I'm only halfway through the last one.

717
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,740
Which is the one that I...

718
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,340
I don't think I ever watched it.

719
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,500
I don't think I ever finished it.

720
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,400
I remember the first movie.

721
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,300
I was like, oh okay.

722
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,540
I've watched this one for sure.

723
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,760
Did you see the prequel?

724
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:23,980
Did you see the prequel?

725
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,780
There's a prequel?

726
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,600
Hope you're doing good.

727
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,340
Mint also happy.

728
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,320
National sugar cookie day.

729
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,160
Why isn't it the mint cookie?

730
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:35,760
Why isn't it the mint cookie?

731
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,740
It was in the theaters recently.

732
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,360
No way!

733
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,180
Recently?

734
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,060
Wasn't...

735
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,960
Wasn't there like a joke that...

736
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,020
I actually looked for him.

737
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,380
Isn't there a joke that like...

738
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,840
Moist Critical is in the movies?

739
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,200
I couldn't find him though.

740
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,960
I actually don't know where he was at.

741
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,400
How Hungry Games?

742
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,560
Actually that was like...

743
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,220
the craziest scene when they were like...

744
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,560
How Hungry?

745
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,580
And then they actually ate the horse.

746
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,980
That was wild!

747
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,720
I can't believe that was in the movie.

748
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,520
They go the Hunger Games?

749
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,900
Well how... sorry spoilers.

750
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,560
And they go Hunger Games?

751
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,800
Well how hungry?

752
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,100
How hungry?

753
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,460
And then they eat a horse.

754
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,350
That's kinda messed up.

755
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,550
Hunger Games are more messed up than I remember them being.

756
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,250
What is a Hunger Games prequel?

757
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,390
The peckish games?

758
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,930
Well I imagine...

759
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,610
Um probably.

760
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,870
You know when you like eat a snack.

761
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,290
The brunch games.

762
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,650
When you're like kinda hungry but...

763
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,350
The starving games.

764
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:01,970
Too easy.

765
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,470
The peckish games.

766
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:06,950
The peckish games.

767
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,950
I'm feeling a bit rather peckish.

768
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:09,390
I'm feeling a bit rather peckish.

769
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,850
Might as well...

770
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:12,170
Might as well...

771
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,390
Might play a game about it.

772
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,510
That's Oliver...

773
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,390
Oliver Twist.

774
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:20,670
That's the peckish games.

775
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,690
Play sir.

776
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,470
May I have some more?

777
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:27,930
I'm so hungry.

778
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,310
I mean sorry.

779
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,090
I'm feeling rather peckish.

780
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,290
The peckish games.

781
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,130
How about the hangry games?

782
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:43,990
More.

783
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,750
You want more?

784
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,830
Yes please sir.

785
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:51,690
Please just an ounce or...

786
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:52,050
You want some more?

787
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,930
The snack games.

788
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,520
The hangry games would go hard.

789
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,100
The hangry games would go hard.

790
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,960
Why do they call it the hunger games?

791
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:06,560
Why do they call it the hunger games?

792
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,080
Because you're hungry for blood maybe?

793
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,660
Marilyn thanks for the five gifted.

794
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,320
Surely you're not hungry for food.

795
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,880
Remember when she said the game's over it's hunger time.

796
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,480
Yeah I love that part.

797
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,300
She picked up her fork and knife.

798
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,700
She was just like...

799
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,120
Oh yeah.

800
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,380
Let's eat.

801
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:31,960
Hungry for power?

802
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,600
That's kind of deep.

803
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,120
It's kind of deep.

804
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,440
They're not hungry for food.

805
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,200
They're hungry for power.

806
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,800
We stay hungry.

807
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,520
We devour.

808
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,740
The devour games.

809
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,540
It's not a game.

810
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,380
Devour.

811
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,560
It's like a horror game.

812
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,780
I love kusoge.

813
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,820
I love horror kusoge.

814
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,440
It's so fun.

815
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,080
Devour is a real game.

816
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,300
That's what I just said.

817
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,920
It's like phasmo.

818
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,470
What am I missing?

819
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,410
In there.

820
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,750
In the little nooks and crannies.

821
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,830
Did she say phasbear?

822
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,790
No but...

823
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,830
Sounds like you heard what you wanted to hear.

824
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:26,570
Sounds like you heard what you wanted to hear.

825
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:28,230
Sausages!

826
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,430
Thanks for the gift.

827
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,230
Thank you.

828
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:33,630
Here.

829
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:35,230
Maybe.

830
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,340
How much?

831
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,720
There we go.

832
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,860
Pineapple leaf cleaned.

833
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,460
Pineapple leaf cleaned.

834
00:45:59,480 --> 00:45:59,660
Ho.

835
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,720
Ho.�.

836
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,520
Why did he choose that song?

837
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,180
Mozart's in his grave.

838
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,880
He's rolling over in his grave.

839
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,400
My legacy's been reduced to an animotronic populations.

840
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,080
Now, cut to the jump scare.

841
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,700
Oh.

842
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,460
Hold on.

843
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,880
You'll never know when it's coming.

844
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,700
You'll never know when the jumpscare is coming.

845
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:59,060
Did I scare

846
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,300
you?

847
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:08,940
No.

848
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,260
Actually, yes.

849
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,540
Yeah!

850
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,380
I'm a ghost!

851
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,040
I'm a ghost!

852
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:24,680
I'm a ghost!

853
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,380
I'm a ghost!

854
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:26,980
I'm a ghost!

855
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:27,480
I'm a ghost!

856
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,440
I'm a ghost.

857
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,280
Wow!

858
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,080
Joy!

859
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,100
Oh yeah, watch that dirty pineapple.

860
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,080
That naughty pineapple.

861
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,060
Get in those nooks, Minty.

862
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:44,900
Why?

863
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,300
Why you say it like that, Joy?

864
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,760
Why?

865
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,140
Thank you so much for the Akatsuba.

866
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:50,580
Thank you!

867
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,120
Oh, there's a whole tip.

868
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,880
There we go.

869
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,960
I think I just died there from cuteness.

870
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:01,960
Stop!

871
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,080
No!

872
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,600
You were terrified, to be honest.

873
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:11,710
Squidward's house.

874
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,140
I have to get the rest of these...

875
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,580
plants.

876
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,860
I fear no man but this ghost.

877
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:23,420
Oh!

878
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,580
Right here.

879
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,060
Nice.

880
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,620
Oh, okay.

881
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,440
I see that.

882
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:32,820
Now!

883
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,460
I cried from fear.

884
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,000
Don't cry!

885
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:38,860
Don't cry!

886
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,400
I'm sorry.

887
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,700
I didn't mean to scare you that much.

888
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:43,960
I'm sorry.

889
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,360
I'm sorry.

890
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:45,960
I'm sorry.

891
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,000
I'm sorry.

892
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,480
I'm not sorry.

893
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,200
Pick up the scaffold while you're on it.

894
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,140
Can you do that?

895
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:00,010
Nice.

896
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,310
This one.

897
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,080
I think the whole other side needs to be cleaned.

898
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:11,720
Yep.

899
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,240
Disgusting.

900
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,480
SpongeBob, how do you...

901
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,280
You live like this?

902
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,480
Man, I love Mint Phantom.

903
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,860
And this nice shade of green.

904
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,000
I'm sorry.

905
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,020
Isn't it so perfect that that Super Chat is basically mint?

906
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,060
You guys never even have to send a Akasupa.

907
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:29,860
These ones...

908
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,260
The mint ones look so much better.

909
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,520
Here's...

910
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,500
Here's a jumpscare for you.

911
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,080
Notice regarding Mint Phantom.

912
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,360
What?

913
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,540
That's a jumpscare in and of itself.

914
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,160
Because who's sending this notice?

915
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,940
Who's sending that?

916
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,620
Mint Phantom?

917
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,200
Evil Mint Phantom.

918
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,520
No disregarding Mint Phantom.

919
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,040
I have kidnapped her.

920
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,560
And if you want her back?

921
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,800
I am asking for...

922
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,160
One million dollars.

923
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,040
Or you'll never see your precious maid ever again.

924
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:24,180
If my demands are not met within 24 hours.

925
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,720
I will launch...

926
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,280
I will launch my attack.

927
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,000
I don't think I can say that I'll launch a nuclear weapon.

928
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,500
Like I'm referencing Metal Gear.

929
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,740
Because I think maybe YouTube might pick up on that.

930
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,140
Also my phone is listening.

931
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:41,660
Hold on.

932
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,400
New Year's Mutsuki.

933
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,360
New Year's Mutsuki.

934
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,580
New Year's Mutsuki.

935
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:55,760
New Year's Mutsuki.

936
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,680
New Year's Mutsuki.

937
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,680
Best I can do is 10 bucks.

938
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,960
Give ghost please.

939
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,180
Wow this is looking real spic and span.

940
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,610
Good taste sensei.

941
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,210
What am I...

942
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,490
Oh here.

943
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,250
Nice.

944
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,370
Wait stepping stone.

945
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,170
Little corners.

946
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:46,790
Level...

947
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:49,130
Chibi Mint shall be my demise.

948
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,110
Chibi Mint...

949
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,070
Will just be your demise.

950
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:55,110
Honestly.

951
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:56,690
Watch out.

952
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,010
Good luck kidnappers.

953
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,930
You will need...

954
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:03,250
Hi sweet!

955
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,630
Thank you for the 50 Captain!

956
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,390
Thank you so much!

957
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:08,830
Thank you!

958
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:13,050
I can't tell how much of this damage...

959
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:13,910
There's some pineapples left.

960
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:21,650
Also in here.

961
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:23,290
Corners and stuff.

962
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,230
Nice it worked.

963
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:41,390
Wait.

964
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:42,690
There's still stuff in here though.

965
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:48,550
It worked.

966
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:56,680
Oh.

967
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,100
It worked.

968
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,920
How much of this is left of Spongebob's house?

969
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,360
Bubble stand.

970
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,480
Chimney, front door, frame, garage door.

971
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,360
Oh wait clean.

972
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,260
What is missing?

973
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,950
What is missing?

974
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:20,990
I physically...

975
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,690
I'm pressing tab and nothing is...

976
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:23,010
Oh there.

977
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,080
My goodness.

978
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,240
Let's see.

979
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,220
Pathway and...

980
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,040
Oh the stepping stones.

981
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,260
Here.

982
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:40,680
Nice.

983
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,440
Pathway.

984
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,400
Very precise.

985
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,140
Yes.

986
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:48,580
Indeed.

987
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,400
Nice.

988
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,060
I think that was both the stepping stones.

989
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,740
It's so bright.

990
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,040
Oh.

991
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,960
I can barely see where there's dirt.

992
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:01,900
On the pathway.

993
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,400
Gary!

994
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,940
We'll get you out of there.

995
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,180
We'll get you out of there.

996
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,780
The one...

997
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,160
They call Sha.

998
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,200
Your name's cut off.

999
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,020
Thanks for the gift.

1000
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:19,580
Sha.

1001
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:19,800
Sha.

1002
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,350
Poor Gary's hungry.

1003
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:27,090
Alright let's see how much of Spongebob's house.

1004
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,070
Pineapple panels.

1005
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,670
Oh we still have dirt.

1006
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,090
Four more.

1007
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,850
And the bottom pineapple panels.

1008
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:36,730
And the portholes.

1009
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,070
The portholed windows.

1010
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:49,370
Okay hold on.

1011
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:50,710
Let's do this one first.

1012
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:51,910
Oh here.

1013
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:56,440
Meow.

1014
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:57,960
Underneath.

1015
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:58,980
Nice.

1016
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,800
I think the window itself though.

1017
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,040
Maybe it's okay.

1018
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,520
Release the Gary.

1019
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,780
Gary are you okay in there?

1020
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,400
Gary.

1021
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:15,750
Spongebob.

1022
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:19,410
Spongebob.

1023
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:20,850
Spongebob.

1024
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:24,010
Okay.

1025
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,130
Let's put it down.

1026
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,760
Even my...

1027
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,620
Even my...

1028
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,680
Even my feet kind of sound like Spongebob.

1029
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,780
Oh here.

1030
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:41,680
Nice.

1031
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,560
I think I got it.

1032
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,300
Oh no I don't.

1033
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,320
Got it.

1034
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,200
You guys which one's not clean?

1035
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,300
I can't tell at all.

1036
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,780
Actually let's try...

1037
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,060
Highlighting them.

1038
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,040
I'm eating pockets.

1039
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,440
I got some choco mint pocky in Japan.

1040
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,660
I was gonna take a picture of it and be like...

1041
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,960
Hehe it's me.

1042
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,700
And then I just ended up eating it.

1043
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,400
Would you recommend it?

1044
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,720
Yeah I really like it.

1045
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,240
The hell is that?

1046
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,740
I was looking at the leaves not the panels.

1047
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,640
There we go.

1048
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,160
But other ones are not clean.

1049
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,250
My footsteps even sound like Spongebob.

1050
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:08,050
There's a...

1051
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:08,510
What what what?

1052
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,470
There's a progress bar for what you're cleaning.

1053
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:13,110
Oh.

1054
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:14,370
You're right.

1055
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,660
I think I need to get up top there.

1056
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,780
Spongebob watch along.

1057
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,660
Spongebob watch along.

1058
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,400
Spongebob watch along.

1059
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,480
What's your favorite episode of Spongebob?

1060
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,220
If you have one.

1061
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,360
I don't know what my favorite episode would be.

1062
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,400
I think I really like the ones with the flying dutchman.

1063
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:45,420
Hahaha.

1064
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,180
Idiot box?

1065
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,230
I remember one time I told my mom.

1066
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:57,510
The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.

1067
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:58,530
She was like...

1068
00:57:58,530 --> 00:57:58,830
Wow.

1069
00:57:58,950 --> 00:57:59,130
I don't know what you're talking about.

1070
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,550
Minto, where did you learn such language?

1071
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:02,970
You're so smart.

1072
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:03,950
My child's a genius.

1073
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:04,950
And I was like...

1074
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:05,790
Spongebob.

1075
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:10,370
I learned from Spongebob.

1076
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:10,930
Yippee.

1077
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:16,450
You keep reminding me of games I own that I need to play.

1078
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,230
First Bloons and now Power Watch Simulator.

1079
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:19,730
That's why you're my OC.

1080
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:20,310
Hahaha.

1081
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:22,770
Pineapple panels.

1082
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:22,990
Pineapple panels.

1083
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:27,110
Pineapple panels.

1084
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:28,530
Also bottom pineapple panels.

1085
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:29,070
Oh here.

1086
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:32,830
Nice.

1087
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:37,700
Nice.

1088
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,560
There we go.

1089
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,140
There we go.

1090
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,540
Oh this one.

1091
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,240
Nice.

1092
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,780
And then...

1093
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,240
Pineapple panels.

1094
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:51,880
Pineapple panels.

1095
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,300
These two.

1096
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:57,580
Nice.

1097
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,480
Nice.

1098
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:02,140
PPAP.

1099
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:04,780
Pineapple.

1100
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,980
Reef blower nozzle.

1101
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,380
Gosh this is getting...

1102
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,020
Oh no that's clean.

1103
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,140
Sorry I was looking at the bicycle.

1104
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,320
We're done with Spongebob's house.

1105
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:18,980
Shanghai.

1106
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,220
That's the one with the flying Dutchman though right?

1107
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,540
That's the one with the flying Dutchman though right?

1108
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:24,700
Oh.

1109
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,200
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea.

1110
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,500
Like I really like the one where...

1111
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:30,940
Uh...

1112
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:31,660
Like the...

1113
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,080
Hahaha.

1114
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,600
I really like that episode.

1115
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,160
It's funny.

1116
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,520
Old episode...

1117
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,100
Old Spongebob episodes are so funny.

1118
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,360
They're so good.

1119
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,900
Old Spongebob is such a treat.

1120
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:52,780
Oh.

1121
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,240
Imagine how many friends you'd have if you were a dirt.

1122
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,460
A dirt.

1123
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,980
Okay, what are you trying to say Patrick?

1124
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,720
He says you got to be like a dirty scumbag to have friends, huh?

1125
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,260
Kind of weird to think that.

1126
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,280
Spongebob you would you would still be my best friend if he was a dirt.

1127
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,720
Would you still love me if I were a worm?

1128
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:17,600
Real.

1129
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,140
Would you love me even if I was a dirt?

1130
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:23,380
Dirt!

1131
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,760
Patrick's a real one.

1132
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:32,930
Dirt Vtuber.

1133
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:35,590
Now that I don't think I've ever seen before.

1134
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:37,350
A dirt Vtuber.

1135
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,570
Seen a lot of Vtubers.

1136
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:43,370
I don't know if I've ever seen a dirty... a dirt one.

1137
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,050
Just plain old dirt.

1138
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,250
But what kind of dirt are they gonna be?

1139
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:49,710
Like what are they?

1140
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:52,750
You know, there's like different types of dirt.

1141
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,490
Are they like a red clay?

1142
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:55,250
Are they...

1143
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:55,750
Are they like a...

1144
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:57,270
A soil?

1145
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:58,330
What are they like?

1146
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,130
New outfit idea.

1147
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:03,810
It's me.

1148
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,510
I will become the dirt Vtuber.

1149
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,000
Yeah, I just realized I am watching a TV aren't I?

1150
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,120
But we're under the water.

1151
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:14,780
It makes sense.

1152
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:15,780
It's fine.

1153
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:16,180
It's...

1154
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,140
One of those fancy new... new age.

1155
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:32,780
Like the what?

1156
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,160
Pokemon?

1157
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,380
Sandcastle Pokemon.

1158
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:37,660
What's that?

1159
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:46,320
I can't... I... can't... under... stand... your... accent.

1160
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,060
I want socks at Spongebob Trivia.

1161
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,360
Trivia this weekend?

1162
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,300
Wait a second.

1163
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,840
What kind of questions do they ask at Spongebob Trivia?

1164
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,080
I'm so curious.

1165
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,440
What do they ask at Spongebob Trivia?

1166
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,460
Ask me any question about Spongebob.

1167
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,240
I can probably get it.

1168
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,080
Ask me any question about Spongebob.

1169
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:18,080
I can probably get it.

1170
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,980
And then if I get it right, you have to send me the socks instead.

1171
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,420
I'm the true champion.

1172
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,420
If I can get it correct, you have to send me the socks instead.

1173
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,460
What's the name... first name of Mr. Krabs?

1174
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:34,720
Eugene.

1175
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,540
Next question.

1176
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,240
Shanghai had aired in 2001.

1177
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:44,740
So for the past 23 years, every time one of us parks in a car, my father and I have quoted Spongebob.

1178
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,200
Trying to park the Dutchmanship.

1179
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:47,740
You're good.

1180
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:48,820
You're good?

1181
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:49,300
Me too!

1182
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:52,880
Hope you're doing well.

1183
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,840
Not sure if you realize, but the devs recently made an Alice in Wonderland DLC.

1184
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,060
I did see that!

1185
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:58,840
I did see that one.

1186
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,160
I thought about doing it.

1187
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,900
Instead of the Spongebob one.

1188
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,760
But the Spongebob one just seems so tempting.

1189
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,240
First name of Mr. Krabs mom.

1190
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:18,620
Suzie?

1191
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:19,500
Suzan?

1192
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,820
You guys!

1193
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:27,340
By drawing the nipple I accidentally made the Smash logo!

1194
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:30,460
Everybody's here!

1195
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,640
Oh my gosh!

1196
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,920
It became the Smash logo!

1197
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:37,620
Letter!

1198
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,560
I've been honorably discharged.

1199
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,000
Yeah!

1200
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:56,740
Oh, sorry.

1201
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:57,760
Dishonorably.

1202
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:58,540
Yeah!

1203
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,220
I'm going to Smash!

1204
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,720
I'm gonna draw you guys.

1205
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:23,900
In honor of Smash.

1206
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,480
Stop staring at me with them big ol' eyes.

1207
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:45,300
Which one of you fellers is the real Dirty Dan?

1208
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,800
Besides Mint, obviously.

1209
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:49,800
Who is number one?

1210
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,560
Hence, he has a sick hat.

1211
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,000
Jerma Winsome Jensen.

1212
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,780
He was number one!

1213
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,080
He was number one!

1214
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,780
I can't believe it actually created this.

1215
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,400
Wait, how does the Smash song go?

1216
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,820
I don't want to get rid of it.

1217
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,520
We'll go do Squidward's house instead.

1218
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,080
What all is there to do in Patrick's house anyway?

1219
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:51,560
But I guess we could do the inside.

1220
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:56,740
Close enough!

1221
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:57,420
What do you mean?

1222
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,820
Is that not it?

1223
01:05:58,940 --> 01:05:59,700
Did I get it wrong?

1224
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,240
I thought you meant Smash Mouth.

1225
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,640
Do you think Smash Mouth will come back for...

1226
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:04,680
Do you think Smash Mouth will come back for...

1227
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:08,280
...for Shrek 5?

1228
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,120
Were they even in Shrek 4?

1229
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,200
Why can't I jump?

1230
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:14,600
There we go.

1231
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,660
Do you think they'll come back?

1232
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:21,480
It

1233
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:38,500
was such... It was... Oh my god, you're right!

1234
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:39,740
No!

1235
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,260
No!

1236
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:46,950
I'm invited now.

1237
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:47,650
No!

1238
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:55,740
Well...

1239
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,340
Um...

1240
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,220
Uh...

1241
01:06:59,620 --> 01:06:59,980
Anyway...

1242
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,760
I really didn't mean that rudely.

1243
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,140
I completely forgot.

1244
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,280
I'm so sad.

1245
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,800
I really didn't... I'm not trying to be insensitive.

1246
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,180
Don't cancel me.

1247
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:20,350
Stream over.

1248
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:21,150
Stream over.

1249
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:24,270
Stream over.

1250
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:30,590
It would be really messed up if they tried to AI his voice.

1251
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:30,970
You know?

1252
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:34,970
The hinge.

1253
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:38,230
Cut this part out of the mod.

1254
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:39,510
Clear the mod!

1255
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,040
Let me scram!

1256
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:46,500
Scadaddle!

1257
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:49,680
Get out of here!

1258
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:52,580
No!

1259
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:55,260
Scatter!

1260
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:57,260
That's the word I was thinking about.

1261
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:01,420
You guys know that game.

1262
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,340
That one...

1263
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,220
Switch game.

1264
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,020
1-2 Switch.

1265
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,820
Where the guy is just like...

1266
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,900
Instead of saying fire, he's like...

1267
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:09,360
Friends!

1268
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,500
Family!

1269
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:16,760
Scramble!

1270
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:18,660
Scadaddle!

1271
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,020
Scatter!

1272
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,080
That was me trying to come up with that word.

1273
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:30,480
He'll be like... Four!

1274
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,900
Instead of fire...

1275
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,760
Basically the game is...

1276
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,360
It's a cowboy game.

1277
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,280
And you're supposed to be like...

1278
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,560
Ready...

1279
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:40,600
Steady...

1280
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,040
And you don't fire the gun until he says fire.

1281
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,320
But sometimes he says...

1282
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,000
Friends!

1283
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:47,680
Yeah!

1284
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:48,560
Quick draw!

1285
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,460
Quick draw!

1286
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,940
Sometimes he says...

1287
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:55,160
Other stuff that's not fire.

1288
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,260
So it's kind of to trip you up.

1289
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,200
Scale it!

1290
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,300
Fly!

1291
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,280
Fox die!

1292
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:08,680
Janai!

1293
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,790
Wow, I forgot his place is blue.

1294
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:20,210
So nasty.

1295
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:27,710
Hi ball boy!

1296
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:29,590
Thanks for the five gifts.

1297
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:30,910
Thank you so much!

1298
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:33,650
I wonder then...

1299
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:34,910
Who will do the music for...

1300
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:36,690
New Shrek.

1301
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:39,910
Unless they had like some old songs...

1302
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:40,570
That they didn't release.

1303
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:42,350
Like the Beatles.

1304
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:46,010
The Beatles put out a new song like...

1305
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,570
Two months ago.

1306
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:49,530
That's kind of insane.

1307
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,520
It was all...

1308
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,900
It was only All Star before, wasn't it?

1309
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,920
No, they also have...

1310
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,400
When I saw her face.

1311
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,100
I'm a believer.

1312
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,400
Leave Squidward's house dirty.

1313
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,000
Not a trace.

1314
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:13,000
A doubt in my mind.

1315
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,480
I'm in love.

1316
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,500
I'm a believer.

1317
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,340
Oh, but there is a cover.

1318
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,280
Oh, that's true.

1319
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,020
I guess you're right.

1320
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:25,400
I couldn't leave her if I tried.

1321
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,300
That's how you feel about Minto.

1322
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:32,540
When I saw her face.

1323
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,760
When I saw her face.

1324
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,360
I'm a believer in ghosts.

1325
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,340
Not a trace.

1326
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,160
Not a trace.

1327
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,860
A doubt in my mind.

1328
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,460
I see ghosts.

1329
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:47,100
I'm a believer.

1330
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:47,840
I'm a believer.

1331
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,160
I could see her.

1332
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,240
If I tried.

1333
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:52,840
If I tried.

1334
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,320
I believe.

1335
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,100
Do you guys believe in ghosts?

1336
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,000
Be honest.

1337
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,220
Before Minto.

1338
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,260
Before me.

1339
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,000
Did you believe in ghosts?

1340
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,460
I have like this...

1341
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,000
What's the word?

1342
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:10,000
Guilty pleasure of watching really horrible ghost hunting shows and stuff.

1343
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:15,240
Like I just love watching the ones where they over exaggerate everything.

1344
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,340
So much fun.

1345
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,340
Yes?

1346
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,100
Not really?

1347
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,120
Yeah, sure.

1348
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:22,960
Jack Baggins.

1349
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,900
There's one called on YouTube.

1350
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,740
I was literally just watching it earlier today while I was working on stuff.

1351
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:31,720
Called Project Fear.

1352
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:38,560
And they're just the most overreactive silly gooses I've ever seen.

1353
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,660
Makes for great television.

1354
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,250
On YouTube.

1355
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:53,110
So television on YouTube is basically free.

1356
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:56,510
I've always believed in the power of ghosts.

1357
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:58,130
I've always believed in the power of ghosts.

1358
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:02,410
Sam and Colby.

1359
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:03,510
I've never actually...

1360
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:06,470
Okay, I hear about them all the time, but I've never actually watched them.

1361
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:11,170
But I know about them.

1362
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:15,270
Because the other of those funny ghost channels...

1363
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:16,990
Hunting channels also talk about them.

1364
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:20,390
They're like, this place was explored by Sam and Colby.

1365
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,630
They're like, this place was explored by Sam and Colby.

1366
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:25,670
I love ghost adventures.

1367
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:26,910
Mainly because I love the crew.

1368
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:28,770
Who's your Oshie?

1369
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,140
I don't know who my...

1370
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,620
I think Aaron is his name.

1371
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:37,400
The bald guy.

1372
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,460
I think he'd be my Oshie.

1373
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,120
Thanks for the bros!

1374
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:44,360
I hope I said your name right.

1375
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:45,440
If not...

1376
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:50,580
Gosh, this bike is killing me.

1377
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,480
This bike is evil.

1378
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,860
Evil thing to...

1379
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:57,480
Ugh, finally.

1380
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,140
Ew, bald?

1381
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,400
What's wrong with bald?

1382
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:04,780
Bald is beautiful!

1383
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,220
If you're bald and watching...

1384
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,200
You're beautiful.

1385
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:16,750
The power washer is my Kami Oshie.

1386
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:29,640
Bald is justice.

1387
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,120
Okay, let's not go that far.

1388
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,200
Hahahaha.

1389
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,480
Bald...

1390
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,520
Moe is justice.

1391
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,300
Everybody.

1392
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:41,600
Moe.

1393
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,200
Moe is power.

1394
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,620
Moe is justice.

1395
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,620
Moe is everything.

1396
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,760
When you bald, you shine like a diamond.

1397
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:53,720
Exactly.

1398
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:59,040
Pick up that game you talked about yesterday.

1399
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:00,380
The neighbors one.

1400
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,440
I found it.

1401
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,520
Bald is Moe.

1402
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,120
Moe is justice, therefore bald is...

1403
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,500
Is bald really Moe?

1404
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,040
I should have given him nostrils.

1405
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,180
Wow.

1406
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,720
This is what she sees.

1407
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:31,250
Is Walter White Moe?

1408
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:32,870
Probably.

1409
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:35,650
He says...

1410
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:36,310
No!

1411
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:39,370
Don't do it!

1412
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:41,830
He says...

1413
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:42,950
Don't do the drugs!

1414
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:44,410
No!

1415
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:53,550
Jessie!

1416
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:58,890
Never seen a single episode of...

1417
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:00,150
of Breaking Bad.

1418
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:02,610
There's a Gap Moe and then there's Bald Moe.

1419
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:04,270
Oh!

1420
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:05,770
It's all coming back to me, meow.

1421
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:08,010
We did clean up last night.

1422
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:09,270
Wait, what happened then?

1423
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:11,910
This is your definition of clean?

1424
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,730
My favorite thing is...

1425
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:22,330
is a Gap Moe between like...

1426
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,090
really burly, cool men...

1427
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:25,970
and them being just cinnamon rolls.

1428
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:28,250
Gary and I got our second wind...

1429
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:29,410
and tackled the stubborn stains.

1430
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:41,510
And Patrick...

1431
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:43,470
sleep cleaned the rest...

1432
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:44,970
with the reef blower.

1433
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,790
Go team!

1434
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:49,350
You're not just a ghost.

1435
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,230
You're an ethereal life form that can absorb...

1436
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:53,350
info via life essence to gain knowledge...

1437
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:54,670
and become the cute maid you are now.

1438
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:57,530
Again?

1439
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:00,130
Nice.

1440
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:04,350
Bikini Bottom's looking clean so far.

1441
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:07,230
Also, it was a thrill to chat with you for the first time in three years...

1442
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:08,110
at this year's Omkai.

1443
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:09,790
Philip!

1444
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:10,370
Thank you!

1445
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:15,130
Three years.

1446
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:17,450
Haven't really believed in ghosts...

1447
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:17,950
in a long time.

1448
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:19,170
I don't think the top 10...

1449
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:21,390
ghost caught on camera videos are helping their case either.

1450
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:23,290
What are you talking... Why am I...

1451
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:24,810
not in one of those compilations?

1452
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:29,090
Why am I not in one of those compilations?

1453
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:29,330
Huh?

1454
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:34,960
I'm a ghost caught on camera.

1455
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,780
Your whole channel's a compilation.

1456
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,140
That's what I'm saying.

1457
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,740
Here, let's get rid of the therapy.

1458
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:55,060
Oh!

1459
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:55,820
25 cents.

1460
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,460
Oh, I was only charging 5 cents for therapy.

1461
01:16:58,880 --> 01:16:59,320
So...

1462
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,400
Spongebob's ripping you off...

1463
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:02,580
Spongebob's ripping you off...

1464
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,180
Just letting you know.

1465
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,780
Just letting you know.

1466
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,340
No more therapy!

1467
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:16,840
No more therapy!

1468
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:17,360
Down with therapy!

1469
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:20,680
Yeah!

1470
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:23,340
Yeah!

1471
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,480
You're too scary for the compilations?

1472
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,320
Someone send in that jump scare.

1473
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:32,440
You're too scary for the compilations?

1474
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,240
You're not a ghost caught on camera, you are a ghost only on camera.

1475
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:38,300
You're not a ghost caught on camera, you are a ghost only on camera.

1476
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,240
Can't argue with that.

1477
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,500
Why do you have to be so logical about it?

1478
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:47,890
Why do you have to be so logical about it?

1479
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:52,610
Wait, hold on.

1480
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:53,170
Wait, hold on.

1481
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,840
Probably the top.

1482
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:58,660
The tippy top.

1483
01:17:59,040 --> 01:17:59,300
Probably the top.

1484
01:17:59,300 --> 01:17:59,300
The tippy top.

1485
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,400
Yep, there it is.

1486
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,280
You're a suit.

1487
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,060
You're a suit.

1488
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:07,460
Me?

1489
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:11,220
You're a suit.

1490
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:11,980
Me?

1491
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:16,600
But therapy is good.

1492
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:17,940
No, we gotta get rid of our competitors.

1493
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,940
Our competitors are trying to rip you off.

1494
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:22,980
Our competitors are trying to rip you off.

1495
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:25,340
Don't worry though.

1496
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:27,020
I won't rip you off.

1497
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,340
Just a little bit.

1498
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:31,580
Spongebob...

1499
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,740
Oh no, that's Patrick.

1500
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:35,200
Bubble stand container.

1501
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,220
This thing?

1502
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:38,740
Where is it dirty?

1503
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,500
Maybe on this side?

1504
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:43,460
Oh, we got it.

1505
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,500
I joined at no more therapy.

1506
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:51,960
Feels like I missed something.

1507
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,820
No, you came just in time.

1508
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:56,500
Do...

1509
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,180
Search mint phantom...

1510
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,440
Feet compilation?

1511
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:08,890
Huh?

1512
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,800
My toes have never once been out.

1513
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:16,880
No!

1514
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,380
Never once!

1515
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,160
Go, go, go!

1516
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:24,300
Go, go, go!

1517
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,240
Go, go, go!

1518
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:27,680
No, no, no!

1519
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:28,400
No, no, no!

1520
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,100
What is this?

1521
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:33,960
What is this?

1522
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,700
Who's leaking my toes to the internet?

1523
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,640
Squidward roof steps.

1524
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:44,820
Oh, the steps!

1525
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:49,990
One.

1526
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:52,610
Two.

1527
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:54,690
Three!

1528
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:56,410
Four.

1529
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:56,690
A four.

1530
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,660
Feet where?

1531
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:04,340
Link so I can avoid it?

1532
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,060
No other reason.

1533
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:07,680
No!

1534
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:13,370
We just washed his ass!

1535
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:15,130
No!

1536
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:18,910
I'm sorry, Squidward.

1537
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:20,390
We have to wash your ass.

1538
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:21,270
I'm so sorry.

1539
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:22,850
No!

1540
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:25,030
No!

1541
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,090
Oh, wipe his butt.

1542
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:33,950
Oh, man.

1543
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:35,330
Bidet Simulator.

1544
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:43,100
That's pretty good.

1545
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:48,040
Am I Spongebob, you think?

1546
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,400
Like, my footsteps sound just like him.

1547
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:00,910
That one's for you guys.

1548
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,000
Blade mode.

1549
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,900
It's time for Jack to let her rip.

1550
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:41,480
It's time for Jack to let her rip.

1551
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,900
Mr. Alvisi, thanks for the 10!

1552
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,140
He's got a chair up here.

1553
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,160
Hold on, let's see if we can jump.

1554
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:54,340
Standing here.

1555
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:59,660
I realized you were not like me.

1556
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:00,680
History.

1557
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:02,680
Daniel, thank you for the Hakasuba!

1558
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:06,060
Just got the last certification I needed to keep my job.

1559
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:10,220
Thank you for indirectly giving me motivation for studying and relaxing during these stressful times.

1560
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,400
Much love, Vito!

1561
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:12,500
Congratulations!

1562
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,100
Oh my gosh, you're all done!

1563
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,480
Now you can relax!

1564
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:18,480
More!

1565
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,420
You did it!

1566
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:20,460
Yay!

1567
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:23,160
Congratulations, Daniel!

1568
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:28,100
Oh my gosh, I didn't do anything, though.

1569
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:28,700
It was all you.

1570
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,280
You think I can kill this guy?

1571
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,320
Oh my gosh, the sun.

1572
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,400
Squidward tentacles!

1573
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,000
Would you please keep her down?

1574
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:46,000
I'm doing a clarinet stream for my adoring fans.

1575
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,400
I'm doing a clarinet stream for my adoring fans.

1576
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:50,400
I'm doing a clarinet stream for my adoring fans.

1577
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,260
Sorry, Mr. Tentacles.

1578
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:54,660
That I cannot do.

1579
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,360
Wash away the anger!

1580
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:14,060
You think Squidward would be a...

1581
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:15,420
good VTuber?

1582
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:18,280
I would watch his...

1583
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,100
his, uh...

1584
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:20,500
What's it called?

1585
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:21,140
His...

1586
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:24,160
clarinet streams, I think?

1587
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,500
It's, you know, it's the idle journey.

1588
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:30,280
It's not about being good from the start.

1589
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,640
It's about... um...

1590
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:33,140
improving over time.

1591
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:34,880
Which he also doesn't do.

1592
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:37,340
And neither do most idles, to be honest.

1593
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:42,900
It's about improvement.

1594
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,460
Over the years, and years, and years.

1595
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:49,920
I mean, just look at me.

1596
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:50,940
I've never improved anything.

1597
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:54,480
I'm not an idle.

1598
01:23:58,620 --> 01:23:59,940
What if I became an idle?

1599
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,000
I wonder what kind of idle I would wanna be.

1600
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:04,440
I wonder what kind of idle I would wanna be.

1601
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:04,480
Oh!

1602
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,240
Wow, that was fast.

1603
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:09,820
I wonder.

1604
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:17,040
A poltergeist idle?

1605
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,700
Like, you know how, like, idles have, like, their...

1606
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:23,180
Is there...

1607
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:24,600
Is there room for, like, a...

1608
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:26,340
Kimotaku idle?

1609
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:30,440
One... an idle that simps over other idles?

1610
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:31,980
Can I do that?

1611
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:40,520
And then anybody who comes to my handshake events is just like, Wasn't... wasn't...

1612
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,600
Wasn't Cherry-chan so cute today?

1613
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,520
And I'd be like, She was so cute today!

1614
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,120
You're so cute today!

1615
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:52,200
And then they'd be like, You're so cute today, Cherry-chan!

1616
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:53,240
I love you, Cherry-chan!

1617
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:57,480
And Cherry-chan would be looking at us like, What the hell?

1618
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:03,460
Yay!

1619
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,940
Wait, did I get the chair?

1620
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,500
I don't think so.

1621
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:12,620
What am I missing?

1622
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,840
Unless... did I get the chair, you guys?

1623
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:16,300
I don't know.

1624
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:18,620
Hold on.

1625
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:19,680
Oh wait, I did!

1626
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:20,100
You're right.

1627
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:28,260
If vtubers can simp for other vtubers, why not idles with other idles?

1628
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,480
Yeah, there's definitely...

1629
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:32,460
I'm not proposing an original concept.

1630
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:38,120
There's so many idles that are like that, that'll be like, Hehe, I'm an idle, but I simp for other idles.

1631
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,060
Um...

1632
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:43,420
Okay.

1633
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:45,360
Let's get off the roof.

1634
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,480
Actually, let's go here.

1635
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:58,010
Original idea.

1636
01:25:58,290 --> 01:25:59,550
Do not steal.

1637
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:02,090
Do not steal my idea.

1638
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:04,890
My OC.

1639
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:08,090
Do not steal.

1640
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:10,270
Oshinoko.

1641
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:11,670
What do you mean, Oshinoko?

1642
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:11,750
Oshinoko!

1643
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:18,490
In fact, I feel like most idles nowadays get into idles because...

1644
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:21,550
Or maybe even vtubers too.

1645
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:25,770
They get into vtubers because they were a fan of another vtuber, another idle, you know?

1646
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:33,470
Like, I'm a fan of this vtuber, I'm a fan of this idle, so I'm gonna become one too.

1647
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:35,010
Just like my favorite.

1648
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:38,710
I think that's how it is usually nowadays.

1649
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:48,830
Thank you.

1650
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:51,210
I did meet you through someone talking about me.

1651
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:52,010
No way!

1652
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:54,190
Like a virus.

1653
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:57,750
The vtuber virus.

1654
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:02,490
You just caught the vtuber virus.

1655
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:08,470
Subscribe to 5 vtubers.

1656
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:13,370
Or else Kizuna Ai will crawl through your computer screen.

1657
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:14,230
Thank you.

1658
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:14,510
Thank you.

1659
01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:15,330
Cheers!

1660
01:27:17,370 --> 01:27:22,110
I brought some family members to the virtual vacation concert, so now they might even be watching this stream!

1661
01:27:22,410 --> 01:27:23,590
More Whisper Phantom!

1662
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:25,130
What?!

1663
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:26,870
Did you bring your grandma?

1664
01:27:27,190 --> 01:27:27,770
Who'd you bring?

1665
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:28,150
Your mom?

1666
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:31,010
Who'd you bring?

1667
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:32,270
Now I'm scared.

1668
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:32,850
Uh oh.

1669
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:33,750
Hello.

1670
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:36,870
I'm family friendly, apparently.

1671
01:27:37,930 --> 01:27:39,730
Nah, I think I'm pretty family friendly.

1672
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:41,310
I say some cuss words though.

1673
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:42,590
Sometimes, but I try not to.

1674
01:27:45,150 --> 01:27:45,810
I'm a good maid.

1675
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,990
Say so, say so, say so.

1676
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:49,990
And I do say so.

1677
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:57,090
Minto's gonna steal your mom!

1678
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:02,900
I would never...

1679
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:04,780
I would never kidnap anybody.

1680
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:06,020
Possession?

1681
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:06,900
Maybe a little bit.

1682
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:07,780
Kidnap?

1683
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,340
How old do you think I am?

1684
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,580
I'm not a kid.

1685
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:14,620
And I'm not napping!

1686
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:21,580
Stealing grandma.

1687
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:23,520
Grandma napping.

1688
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,560
Now that...

1689
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,420
That's a different story.

1690
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:36,120
Your grandmas are not safe.

1691
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:38,480
Pick it up.

1692
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,100
PG-13 at least.

1693
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:55,060
You were flashing your panties to Liquid Snake.

1694
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:56,920
You're right.

1695
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:59,480
Oh my gosh, that totally docked me some points.

1696
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:03,020
But in PG-13, you're allowed...

1697
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,820
2 SH and 1 F word.

1698
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:17,580
I don't know where I'm at.

1699
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:22,600
F for Phantom.

1700
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:35,680
F is for friends who do stuff together.

1701
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,680
Hold on, I'm reading back.

1702
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:57,030
U is for you and me.

1703
01:29:57,990 --> 01:29:59,370
N is for anywhere.

1704
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:00,490
Anytime at all.

1705
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:02,610
Down here in the deep blue sea.

1706
01:30:03,730 --> 01:30:05,050
F is for fire.

1707
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,810
That burns down the whole town.

1708
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:07,890
U is for uranium.

1709
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:09,730
Bombs.

1710
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:11,890
N is for no survivors.

1711
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:20,460
That's my favorite version of the song.

1712
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:23,420
Plankton.

1713
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:34,560
That's not how the song goes.

1714
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,200
It is.

1715
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,560
It's the better version.

1716
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,940
It's the version your mom doesn't want you listening to.

1717
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:47,260
Oh wait, I forgot the rules of nature this one.

1718
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:50,280
Oh!

1719
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:51,020
No!

1720
01:30:55,260 --> 01:31:02,120
So if the dirt was dealt with, but our houses were all filthy again by the time we woke up, that can only mean one thing.

1721
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,320
What is the storyline happening here, SpongeBob?

1722
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,880
I'm actually wondering what is going on.

1723
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:12,720
We're off the hook!

1724
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:13,100
Oh.

1725
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:14,380
No!

1726
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:17,880
You did it.

1727
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:18,600
You did something.

1728
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,380
Wow, not.

1729
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:26,890
I'm sure...

1730
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:29,790
I'm sure SpongeBob and Patrick throw some ragers.

1731
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:33,350
What's a rager anyway?

1732
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:37,870
Is this just a crazy party?

1733
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:47,320
Yeah?

1734
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:47,760
Okay.

1735
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:57,290
I want to make sure it wasn't something, you know...

1736
01:31:58,170 --> 01:31:59,070
Like a...

1737
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:01,210
I think...

1738
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:03,470
Like a...

1739
01:32:03,470 --> 01:32:04,250
What are they called?

1740
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:05,130
The lemon parties?

1741
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:07,870
I wanted to make sure it wasn't like that.

1742
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:10,710
What is it that they have?

1743
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:12,890
The people that are swingers have outside.

1744
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:14,110
Pineapples?

1745
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:32,810
I need to get out of here.

1746
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:34,550
I need to get out of here.

1747
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:36,290
I need to get out of here.

1748
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:38,050
I need to get out of here.

1749
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,260
It was there all along.

1750
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,620
Oh my god, his mocking face.

1751
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,040
He's mocking me!

1752
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:04,580
It's only a swinger thing if the pineapple is upside down.

1753
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:07,720
We're safe!

1754
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:10,680
What if SpongeBob was named FreakBob?

1755
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:30,520
I think his name might even be FreakBob.

1756
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,660
Oh, that's another episode I really like.

1757
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,840
It's the DoodleBob episode.

1758
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:37,500
Noing!

1759
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:37,900
Noing!

1760
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:38,220
Noing!

1761
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:38,720
Noing!

1762
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:39,120
Noing!

1763
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:40,880
Noing!

1764
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:41,880
Noing!

1765
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,000
Noing!

1766
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:43,220
Noing!

1767
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:43,540
episode.

1768
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:48,640
Minoi!

1769
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:49,580
Minoi!

1770
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:53,720
How fast can you sing the campfire song?

1771
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,560
Say MPFI are you a soldier song?

1772
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,400
Say MPFI are you a soldier song?

1773
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:02,240
And if you don't know it, then don't sing along.

1774
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:03,620
And help if you just sing along.

1775
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:05,860
Say MPFI are you a soldier song?

1776
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,460
Say MPFI are you a soldier song?

1777
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:11,200
I don't know the actual words to the song, but it'll help if you just sing along.

1778
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:25,040
I don't know the actual words to the song, Say MPFI are you a soldier song?

1779
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,740
Say MPFI are you a soldier song?

1780
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:28,100
How does it go?

1781
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:33,580
Language Enhancers?

1782
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:38,420
That's the one where they curse, but it's just dolphin noises, right?

1783
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,420
That one is really good.

1784
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:42,620
That one is a really good episode.

1785
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:43,180
That one is a really good episode.

1786
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:55,820
Let's gather round the campfire and sing a campfire song C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-O-N-G song Don't give up.

1787
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:56,460
Keep washing.

1788
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:57,080
I'm washing!

1789
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:57,640
I'm washing!

1790
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:58,120
I'm washing!

1791
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:21,150
We're almost there.

1792
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:24,010
Look, it's starting to look really, just truly like...

1793
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:24,570
Oh my gosh.

1794
01:35:25,330 --> 01:35:27,170
Like real bikini bottom.

1795
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:32,570
Oh, and if you don't think that we can sing it faster than that,

1796
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:39,990
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong.

1797
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:13,040
I can sing it pretty fast.

1798
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:14,440
I think.

1799
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:17,880
I can think I got some real speed there.

1800
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:20,540
It'll help!

1801
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:21,480
It'll help!

1802
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:23,960
Paddle cake!

1803
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:25,120
Welcome back!

1804
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:25,660
Thank you!

1805
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1806
01:36:36,610 --> 01:36:37,550
626 kid.

1807
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:47,730
What was the one Flying Dutchman song?

1808
01:36:48,610 --> 01:36:49,490
He had a song?

1809
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:52,710
I kind of hate cleaning Squidward House.

1810
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:54,250
It's just a bunch of...

1811
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:55,850
It's just really round.

1812
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:01,350
Flying Dutchman song.

1813
01:37:01,930 --> 01:37:02,890
Do you guys remember?

1814
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,600
What was also the one that they sing at the stadium?

1815
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:18,580
That's wonderful.

1816
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:23,000
We'll put the saddest fun to me.

1817
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,660
Sweet, sweet victory, yeah.

1818
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:44,820
Oh sweet, sweet, sweet victory, yeah.

1819
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,900
I like how this basically just turned into a Spongebob.

1820
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:49,620
Discussion and karaoke.

1821
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:10,840
Oh, I just realized that window is still not done.

1822
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:14,960
Come on, turn, turn.

1823
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:16,440
You're good.

1824
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:17,880
You're good.

1825
01:38:19,030 --> 01:38:19,600
You're good.

1826
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:21,660
Nice.

1827
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:26,950
Oh okay, that one's done.

1828
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:30,330
Squidward's glass house is almost finished.

1829
01:38:30,650 --> 01:38:31,090
Oh, the ear.

1830
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:35,390
I didn't realize this was called the ear.

1831
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:40,570
Nice.

1832
01:38:41,710 --> 01:38:43,250
Hope you're feeling a bit better today.

1833
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:44,310
I am, thank you.

1834
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:46,490
Thank you, thank you.

1835
01:38:50,570 --> 01:38:51,410
Yeah, sorry.

1836
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:53,330
Bye bye.

1837
01:38:53,450 --> 01:38:53,890
See you later.

1838
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:57,050
Very sad posting.

1839
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:57,750
See you later.

1840
01:38:57,850 --> 01:38:57,950
See you later!.

1841
01:38:58,610 --> 01:38:59,010
Hehehe...

1842
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:01,150
Now I'm a kid-uh.

1843
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:02,750
I think.huhuhh.,

1844
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:15,610
Let me talk about Spongebob today.

1845
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:16,390
It's a good time.

1846
01:39:16,570 --> 01:39:16,890
I know!

1847
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:19,630
Spongbob was one of my favorite shows as a kid.

1848
01:39:20,410 --> 01:39:21,750
I liked Spongebob a lot.

1849
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:23,350
Let's see, what other shows I really, really, really love.

1850
01:39:23,350 --> 01:39:26,410
I really loved Grim-mandy, but Billy-amandy.

1851
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:28,190
Grim-Adventure was Billy-Amandy.

1852
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:29,890
What better shows do you like?

1853
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:30,450
Okay.

1854
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:30,990
Fine.

1855
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:31,270
I got it.

1856
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:33,130
I made that webcomic about it.

1857
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:34,150
I used to read that one.

1858
01:39:36,910 --> 01:39:39,330
The anime Grim and Man... Grim... Grim...

1859
01:39:39,330 --> 01:39:42,650
Billy... I can't even remember the name of it.

1860
01:39:45,730 --> 01:39:48,470
But Grim... Grim Adventures of Billy and Manny.

1861
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:50,110
You guys know that Grim...

1862
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:52,890
Grim is...

1863
01:39:54,610 --> 01:39:56,610
Grim is voiced by...

1864
01:39:57,290 --> 01:39:58,150
Gray Fox.

1865
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:02,170
Did you know that?

1866
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:07,200
Yeah, the Grim Rippler.

1867
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:10,200
In the show, he's voiced by Gray Fox.

1868
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:11,960
No, really?

1869
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:13,780
Yup.

1870
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:20,660
What is it?

1871
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:22,320
Not Phil Lamarr.

1872
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,800
It is Phil... Wait, is it?

1873
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:35,020
After you finish Squidward's House, you should try to find the...

1874
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:36,360
The what?

1875
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:38,940
The Japanese Battle...

1876
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:39,200
Battle Ship.

1877
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:39,680
What?

1878
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:44,780
Okay, we'll go on a little treasure hunt.

1879
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:48,640
Greg Eagles!

1880
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:49,080
Yes.

1881
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,660
Who did... Phil Lamarr voices someone else.

1882
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:52,240
Who is it?

1883
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:54,980
Thank you, guys.

1884
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:55,300
Yeah.

1885
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:57,320
He voices...

1886
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:57,900
Vamp!

1887
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:03,550
He voices Vamp.

1888
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:05,990
Yes.

1889
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:08,810
Yes, yes, yes.

1890
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:13,770
Yes.

1891
01:41:13,770 --> 01:41:14,250
And, pues.

1892
01:41:16,290 --> 01:41:18,190
He is, yeah.

1893
01:41:18,690 --> 01:41:19,010
Yes.

1894
01:41:20,370 --> 01:41:21,010
Thanks.

1895
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:21,290
That's amazing.

1896
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:21,570
Thank you, Shen�

1897
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:44,090
Not here.

1898
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:47,590
Is this also a piece?

1899
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:48,630
The head.

1900
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:01,400
Let me know when you guys aren't feeling the BGM anymore.

1901
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:02,580
We can change it, don't worry.

1902
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:04,920
The brow.

1903
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:08,400
I think probably on that side is what needs to get done.

1904
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:13,540
Thank you!

1905
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:13,820
Thank you!

1906
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:14,440
Chu!

1907
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:15,700
Chu!

1908
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,860
They were both sunk during nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll.

1909
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:31,960
This is why I find odd that Spongebob knows about Texas but not Arkansas.

1910
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:34,780
Spongebob, I think...

1911
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:43,360
is a mysterious guy who works in mysterious ways and has mysterious knowledge on things that I don't think he should know about.

1912
01:42:52,590 --> 01:42:55,050
I would love to live in a place called Bikini.

1913
01:42:57,450 --> 01:42:59,870
But I think it would turn me on too much every day.

1914
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:03,450
I would wake up and be like, What a beautiful day in Bikini.

1915
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:09,270
Now call the police on me.

1916
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:15,160
It's me.

1917
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:19,740
Did you know Pearl is voiced by the boss?

1918
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:20,080
Yes!

1919
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:21,240
I did know that!

1920
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:26,260
There's fan art of Pearl dressed as the boss.

1921
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:32,020
So much connection between childhood cartoon and...

1922
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:34,580
Metal Gear.

1923
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:35,180
It's beautiful.

1924
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:37,240
Was...

1925
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:39,400
Was this flower always...

1926
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:40,060
Do you see the flower?

1927
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:42,460
But it disappears when it dries.

1928
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:43,760
Was this always here?

1929
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:45,600
That's kind of fun.

1930
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,180
Do you see the flower on his house?

1931
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:55,460
It's a reflection of what?

1932
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:55,880
Oh.

1933
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:55,960
Oh.

1934
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:01,520
Oh, I see the sky.

1935
01:44:06,330 --> 01:44:08,910
Why can't you guys just let me live in magic?

1936
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:13,810
Why can't you just let me live in whimsy, huh?

1937
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:18,660
My ear has been cleaned.

1938
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:32,810
No fun allowed.

1939
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:34,210
No fun allowed.

1940
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:37,290
No fun allowed.

1941
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:37,650
I don't want to grow up.

1942
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:39,990
I don't want to grow up yet.

1943
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:42,390
Why isn't this getting cleaned?

1944
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,620
The nose has been cleaned.

1945
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,080
I thought this channel was family friendly.

1946
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:54,940
What did I say?

1947
01:44:56,340 --> 01:44:58,220
What did I say that wasn't family friendly?

1948
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:02,940
I'm a Toys R Us kid.

1949
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:04,140
Oh, you're a squid.

1950
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:04,720
You're a kid.

1951
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:11,440
You said Spongebob.

1952
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:14,820
Stop the Spongebob slander.

1953
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:17,840
Stop it this once.

1954
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:21,420
Is that?

1955
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:22,320
Oh, the brow.

1956
01:45:28,090 --> 01:45:30,490
Yeah, I did talk about getting turned on.

1957
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:31,510
My bad.

1958
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,920
Minto channel, what has happened to you?

1959
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:41,180
Nice.

1960
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:44,960
Fred, thank you.

1961
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:52,720
These strange pirates sold me a homemade pie for $25.

1962
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:54,340
Would you like it?

1963
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:56,560
Huh?

1964
01:45:58,280 --> 01:45:58,980
Oh my god.

1965
01:45:59,020 --> 01:45:59,680
Whisper now.

1966
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:04,220
I hope your foot recovers soon.

1967
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:07,160
You went to the maid work cafe.

1968
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:09,220
All three days I was in LA.

1969
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:09,960
It was really fun.

1970
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:11,960
I even got your maid on the last day.

1971
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:13,860
They said you were really sweet and cute.

1972
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:14,380
Stop.

1973
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:16,260
No way.

1974
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:17,260
What was it?

1975
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:17,840
Maid Meru?

1976
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,100
Or maid latte.

1977
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:24,360
I really liked maid latte.

1978
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:25,100
She's so cute.

1979
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:29,660
Oh my gosh.

1980
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:32,000
Actually, my friend went to the maid cafe.

1981
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:33,940
Did you guys...

1982
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:37,640
Did you guys watch the vlog that I made?

1983
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:40,340
My friend, she actually went...

1984
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,920
During the weekend.

1985
01:46:46,760 --> 01:47:00,140
And she said that one of the maids there went up to her and was just like, Yeah, ever since Mint made a video on our cafe, we've been way busier.

1986
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:06,180
So I was like, oh my gosh, it worked.

1987
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:11,780
So if you watched and if you also went because of me, Thank you.

1988
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,940
Maybe next time I'll actually get sponsored.

1989
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:19,280
We cleaned the brow.

1990
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:20,840
We got the nose.

1991
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:21,500
We got the brow.

1992
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:22,860
We got the window.

1993
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:23,900
The porta potty.

1994
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:24,740
Porta potty.

1995
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:25,400
Porta potty.

1996
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:25,900
All right.

1997
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:26,760
Now we just need the head.

1998
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:30,640
Where else is dirty?

1999
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:34,400
Influencer.

2000
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:35,620
Influencer.

2001
01:47:41,210 --> 01:47:41,930
Squidward's house.

2002
01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:42,210
Head.

2003
01:47:43,070 --> 01:47:43,510
Patrick's...

2004
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:44,550
Patrick's house.

2005
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:45,030
Rock.

2006
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:46,070
Patrick's house.

2007
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:46,750
Weathervane.

2008
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:50,670
Mintfluencer.

2009
01:47:51,890 --> 01:47:53,250
Oh, here, here, here.

2010
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,440
Okay, that was a little bit more.

2011
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:03,680
Anything else around the rim?

2012
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:05,260
Here, here, here.

2013
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:05,940
Nice.

2014
01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:10,850
We should almost be good.

2015
01:48:10,990 --> 01:48:11,150
Ah!

2016
01:48:13,990 --> 01:48:14,870
Almost died.

2017
01:48:16,230 --> 01:48:17,370
Look at this influencer.

2018
01:48:17,370 --> 01:48:18,170
Influencer influencing.

2019
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:21,450
That's kind of crazy.

2020
01:48:22,530 --> 01:48:23,570
Actually influenced.

2021
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:39,750
Are we good?

2022
01:48:41,950 --> 01:48:43,630
I think YouTube's being silly.

2023
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:51,720
We're back.

2024
01:48:55,490 --> 01:48:56,890
I thought I said something weird.

2025
01:48:56,950 --> 01:48:58,730
Everybody started going, what, what, what?

2026
01:48:59,530 --> 01:49:02,210
Usually only I say something dumb and you guys say that.

2027
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:03,590
I'm just like, what?

2028
01:49:03,770 --> 01:49:04,590
Why'd you say that?

2029
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:05,870
What?

2030
01:49:05,870 --> 01:49:06,150
What?

2031
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:06,410
What?

2032
01:49:06,410 --> 01:49:06,650
What?

2033
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:17,580
What happened?

2034
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:18,320
I don't know.

2035
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:19,080
I think there was a hiccup.

2036
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:21,080
A little hiccup.

2037
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:23,180
Like a hiccup.

2038
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:24,120
Like that.

2039
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:27,160
Why did YouTube do that?

2040
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:28,660
I don't know.

2041
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:30,060
Why, YouTube?

2042
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:30,560
Why?

2043
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,900
Why would you disrupt my streamer like that?

2044
01:49:34,820 --> 01:49:35,260
YouTube.

2045
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:39,480
You have one job and that's to allow me to watch and to peruse.

2046
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:39,740
And that's it.

2047
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:40,120
That's entertainment.

2048
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:44,380
If you don't allow me to do that, what is your point?

2049
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,060
Why, YouTube?

2050
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:46,680
Why?

2051
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,180
There's so much up there.

2052
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:49,480
Okay.

2053
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:54,620
Come on, Neil.

2054
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:00,360
Okay.

2055
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:04,260
Now, I think everything's done but Patrick's place.

2056
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:05,880
Patrick.

2057
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:06,620
Rock.

2058
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:07,280
Yeah.

2059
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,960
I don't want to get rid of the Smash logo.

2060
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:20,620
And the Wisp.

2061
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:23,680
Don't kill the Wisp.

2062
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:24,400
We have to.

2063
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:26,860
We have to do it.

2064
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:29,160
I'm sorry.

2065
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:32,260
That's it.

2066
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:33,300
So true.

2067
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:38,360
Oh, sorry.

2068
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:38,640
Bye bye.

2069
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:46,480
Hello?

2070
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:51,340
Yeah.

2071
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:58,980
Imagine a Ninja Turtle DLC where you have to power wash the sewer layer.

2072
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,280
You're still...

2073
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:03,520
You look at him and he's like, I'm still standing.

2074
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:05,500
Yeah.

2075
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:05,960
Yeah.

2076
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:06,560
Yeah.

2077
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:08,020
Yeah.

2078
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:08,120
Yeah.

2079
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:11,240
Yeah.

2080
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:12,280
Yeah.

2081
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:12,820
Yeah.

2082
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:16,500
I was...

2083
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:16,920
I was...

2084
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:17,360
My eye!

2085
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:23,210
I missed you.

2086
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:24,150
I thought you were gone forever.

2087
01:51:24,270 --> 01:51:26,570
I'm pretty sure the first time I watched you live it was this game.

2088
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:27,830
No way!

2089
01:51:30,830 --> 01:51:31,490
I'm here!

2090
01:51:33,230 --> 01:51:34,210
I'm just chilling.

2091
01:51:36,050 --> 01:51:37,070
Like a villain.

2092
01:51:58,770 --> 01:52:00,430
Oh, gotta do this thing too.

2093
01:52:01,210 --> 01:52:01,990
Goodbye Smash.

2094
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:04,690
Everybody is...

2095
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:05,170
It's not...

2096
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:05,630
Here.

2097
01:52:06,090 --> 01:52:07,070
In hell.

2098
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:24,950
This thing is... Everything with the tiny little...

2099
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:27,750
pieces...

2100
01:52:28,210 --> 01:52:29,630
Such a pain in my side.

2101
01:52:32,570 --> 01:52:34,150
Sakura, I can finally rest.

2102
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:37,490
Yup.

2103
01:52:40,590 --> 01:52:42,870
Oh my gosh, when I was at the convention...

2104
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:45,850
I was going around the artist's alley...

2105
01:52:45,850 --> 01:52:48,290
and I walked by this one person's booth...

2106
01:52:48,290 --> 01:52:51,270
who... I've discovered a hack, you guys.

2107
01:52:51,690 --> 01:52:54,730
I've discovered a hack for getting more Metal Gear merch.

2108
01:52:55,030 --> 01:52:56,410
Or at artist's alley.

2109
01:52:56,690 --> 01:52:59,330
All you have to do is find the people that do...

2110
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:01,010
that do Smash art.

2111
01:53:02,710 --> 01:53:05,950
And then they'll always have Snake because he's in...

2112
01:53:05,950 --> 01:53:06,770
Snake is in Smash!

2113
01:53:07,730 --> 01:53:10,430
And I walked by this one artist's booth...

2114
01:53:10,430 --> 01:53:12,290
and they had a bunch of Smash stickers.

2115
01:53:12,670 --> 01:53:14,390
They had one Snake left.

2116
01:53:14,690 --> 01:53:15,550
And I was like...

2117
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:16,270
Give him to me!

2118
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:19,670
And recently I've been getting like...

2119
01:53:21,930 --> 01:53:23,210
Getting a...

2120
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:27,190
I got like a button at Anime Central and stuff too.

2121
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:31,150
Of Snake.

2122
01:53:31,770 --> 01:53:33,330
It's my... It's my hack.

2123
01:53:36,190 --> 01:53:39,270
Because nobody... There's like never any ever...

2124
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:42,170
Metal Gear art in artist's alley.

2125
01:53:42,530 --> 01:53:45,310
But if I look for the people that do Smash...

2126
01:53:46,230 --> 01:53:47,790
Then they're... Then he's there.

2127
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:48,730
Yeah!

2128
01:53:50,210 --> 01:53:50,690
Tensai!

2129
01:53:55,050 --> 01:53:57,090
And by doing that I've found...

2130
01:53:57,090 --> 01:54:00,510
I've found two new Snakes that I can add to my collection.

2131
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:01,890
The sticker is so cute.

2132
01:54:02,210 --> 01:54:03,470
And I got the last one!

2133
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:04,390
I was so happy!

2134
01:54:04,570 --> 01:54:05,190
I was so excited!

2135
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:07,490
Do you own the Snake amiibo?

2136
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:07,970
I do!

2137
01:54:10,730 --> 01:54:11,570
Snake hack!

2138
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:18,470
You should find Fortnite sellers.

2139
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:20,970
Do those exist?

2140
01:54:21,270 --> 01:54:22,710
And if so, I'm sorry.

2141
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:31,580
How many Snakes do you own?

2142
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,420
My collection now...

2143
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:36,120
I honestly truly can't even tell you.

2144
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:42,330
It sucks though because the art is obvious...

2145
01:54:42,330 --> 01:54:42,870
Wait!

2146
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:44,890
I just remembered there was some more Snake...

2147
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:45,890
Oh no!

2148
01:54:46,210 --> 01:54:48,930
There was some other stuff that I wanted to get at AX.

2149
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:50,450
I remember seeing their Twitter.

2150
01:54:50,830 --> 01:54:51,570
But it was like...

2151
01:54:51,570 --> 01:54:52,550
Snotacon stuff.

2152
01:54:53,150 --> 01:54:53,630
No!

2153
01:54:53,790 --> 01:54:56,210
The artist alley though was really hard to walk through.

2154
01:54:56,330 --> 01:54:57,970
I talk about it in the podcast but...

2155
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:00,410
It was...

2156
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:03,610
So insanely crowded.

2157
01:55:04,330 --> 01:55:06,490
It was really hard to walk through.

2158
01:55:15,670 --> 01:55:16,610
Was it stinky?

2159
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:18,150
I don't think so.

2160
01:55:18,290 --> 01:55:19,050
I didn't smell it.

2161
01:55:19,170 --> 01:55:20,450
It didn't smell bad to me.

2162
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,940
Found a nice set of standee diorama for Liquid and boss fights for MGS1.

2163
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:31,180
In the artist alley!

2164
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:32,560
No way!

2165
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:43,260
I don't think I can get any lower.

2166
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:47,020
Mustache man!

2167
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:50,860
Because this opportunity will never present itself again.

2168
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:53,320
I just want to say you are my favorite floating shopping list.

2169
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:55,760
What does that mean?

2170
01:56:02,690 --> 01:56:03,170
Oh!

2171
01:56:03,990 --> 01:56:04,470
Spongebob!

2172
01:56:14,770 --> 01:56:16,370
Oh my god!

2173
01:56:17,650 --> 01:56:18,550
That was good.

2174
01:56:19,610 --> 01:56:20,450
That was good.

2175
01:56:21,950 --> 01:56:24,450
A floating shopping list!

2176
01:56:25,570 --> 01:56:26,570
Turns it around.

2177
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:36,020
You're right.

2178
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:36,840
Actually, no.

2179
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:39,160
The opportunity may present itself one day again.

2180
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:40,960
What if I play the Spongebob game?

2181
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:56,700
What's a ghost maid doing underwater?

2182
01:56:58,360 --> 01:56:59,800
I'm being a siren.

2183
01:57:01,180 --> 01:57:03,900
I'm attracting poor suckers into the ocean.

2184
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,420
I got a naughty nautical neighbors.

2185
01:57:20,490 --> 01:57:21,290
Jump scare!

2186
01:57:21,790 --> 01:57:23,350
I thought I had way more to do.

2187
01:57:23,710 --> 01:57:24,610
We did it!

2188
01:57:26,890 --> 01:57:27,530
Hold on.

2189
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:28,030
Hold on.

2190
01:57:28,050 --> 01:57:28,950
I'm going to clean up real quick.

2191
01:57:33,550 --> 01:57:35,270
Can I just put it on the ground?

2192
01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:35,870
No!

2193
01:57:36,310 --> 01:57:37,110
Okay, hold on.

2194
01:57:37,130 --> 01:57:39,930
I'll put it behind Squidward's house.

2195
01:57:45,410 --> 01:57:49,090
And then this can go like all the way over here.

2196
01:57:53,670 --> 01:57:54,250
Mom,

2197
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:03,960
I'm in Bikini Bottom!

2198
01:58:07,310 --> 01:58:08,790
I'm in Bikini Bottom!

2199
01:58:10,230 --> 01:58:11,590
I'm in Bikini Bottom!

2200
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:21,420
I'm in... I'm here!

2201
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:27,660
I don't have an eyepatch, but...

2202
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:31,640
No way!

2203
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:35,020
Actually, Karafun has songs from...

2204
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:37,220
Spongebob!

2205
01:58:43,190 --> 01:58:43,950
Captain!

2206
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:48,920
I can't hear you!

2207
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:50,380
Hiya, Captain!

2208
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:56,000
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?

2209
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:58,000
From small square fish!

2210
01:58:58,160 --> 01:58:59,980
Absorbent in yellow empires, is he?

2211
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:02,000
Spongebob Squarepants!

2212
01:59:02,140 --> 01:59:04,320
If nautical nonsense be something you wish...

2213
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:06,040
Spongebob Squarepants!

2214
01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:08,140
He'd drop on the deck and flop like a fish!

2215
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:10,060
Spongebob Squarepants!

2216
01:59:11,100 --> 01:59:12,060
Spongebob Squarepants!

2217
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:13,980
Spongebob Squarepants!

2218
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:16,060
Spongebob Squarepants!

2219
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:17,240
Spongebob!

2220
01:59:28,430 --> 01:59:30,570
Wait, they have so many here.

2221
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:31,550
This is crazy.

2222
01:59:31,670 --> 01:59:32,070
Hold on.

2223
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:35,250
I was just going to sing the theme song, but...

2224
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:36,550
Spongebob Squarepants!

2225
01:59:40,010 --> 01:59:40,930
Spongebob Squarepants!

2226
01:59:40,930 --> 01:59:42,030
The campfire song song.

2227
01:59:42,190 --> 01:59:45,950
Let's gather round the campfire and sing our campfire song.

2228
01:59:46,530 --> 01:59:50,750
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-O-N-G song.

2229
01:59:51,290 --> 01:59:55,770
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong.

2230
01:59:55,870 --> 01:59:59,410
But it will help if you just sing along.

2231
02:00:00,370 --> 02:00:02,450
Bom, bom, bom...

2232
02:00:03,610 --> 02:00:06,030
C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-O-N-G song.

2233
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:08,290
C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-O...

2234
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:08,810
Wait a second.

2235
02:00:08,930 --> 02:00:09,130
Hold on.

2236
02:00:27,110 --> 02:00:30,290
I could just tap Patrick's vocals on.

2237
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:12,780
Okay,

2238
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:22,430
okay, okay, I'm gonna sing it for real.

2239
02:01:23,810 --> 02:01:24,910
I'll have Patrick's vocals.

2240
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:25,950
Oh, God.

2241
02:01:26,150 --> 02:01:26,510
Okay, okay, okay, I'm gonna sing it for real.

2242
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:29,090
I'm crying, this is so funny.

2243
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:38,830
Let's gather around the campfire and sing our campfire song.

2244
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:43,670
Our C-A-M-P-M-R-E-S-O-N-G song!

2245
02:01:44,170 --> 02:01:48,750
And if you don't think that we could sing it, faster than you're wrong.

2246
02:01:48,910 --> 02:01:52,430
But it'll help if you just sing along.

2247
02:01:54,030 --> 02:01:55,270
Oh, turn them off!

2248
02:01:56,710 --> 02:01:58,970
C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-O-N-G song.

2249
02:01:59,110 --> 02:02:01,590
C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-O-N-G song.

2250
02:02:01,710 --> 02:02:06,110
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong, but it'll help if you just sing along.

2251
02:02:06,950 --> 02:02:09,270
C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-O-N-G song.

2252
02:02:09,330 --> 02:02:09,590
Patrick!

2253
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:12,710
Squidward!

2254
02:02:13,450 --> 02:02:13,850
Good!

2255
02:02:14,230 --> 02:02:19,950
It'll help, it'll help, if you just sing along.

2256
02:02:19,950 --> 02:02:21,090
C -A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-O-N-G song!

2257
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:25,330
YAAAAA-

2258
02:02:28,650 --> 02:02:33,520
Oh man, I'm crying!

2259
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:34,720
It's so good!

2260
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:37,660
What's Gary's song?

2261
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:40,440
I don't know that one.

2262
02:02:46,450 --> 02:02:47,750
There's even more.

2263
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:58,430
I thought I had everybody on my side, But I went and blew it all sky high.

2264
02:02:58,710 --> 02:03:02,270
And now she won't even spare a passing glance.

2265
02:03:02,710 --> 02:03:06,590
All just because I ripped my pants.

2266
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:10,090
When Big Larry came round just to put him down.

2267
02:03:10,870 --> 02:03:14,030
SpongeBob turned into a clown.

2268
02:03:14,530 --> 02:03:22,050
And no girl ever wants to dance with a fool who went and ripped his pants.

2269
02:03:22,050 --> 02:03:25,650
I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse.

2270
02:03:25,930 --> 02:03:28,710
But the pain feels so much worse.

2271
02:03:29,670 --> 02:03:33,450
Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun.

2272
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:35,470
Than a burn from the sun.

2273
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:37,690
Or sand in your buns.

2274
02:03:41,230 --> 02:03:45,030
Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget.

2275
02:03:45,550 --> 02:03:48,930
So listen and you won't regret.

2276
02:03:49,390 --> 02:03:50,910
Be true to yourself.

2277
02:03:52,050 --> 02:03:53,150
Don't miss your chance.

2278
02:03:53,410 --> 02:04:00,370
And you won't end up like the fool who ripped his pants.

2279
02:04:06,690 --> 02:04:08,430
I don't remember the song who sang this one.

2280
02:04:08,490 --> 02:04:09,350
It was SpongeBob!

2281
02:04:09,530 --> 02:04:10,970
He ripped his pants!

2282
02:04:11,290 --> 02:04:12,090
Poor guy.

2283
02:04:13,450 --> 02:04:13,890
Alright.

2284
02:04:15,430 --> 02:04:16,610
They have this one too!

2285
02:04:17,630 --> 02:04:19,510
Okay, two more, two more, two more.

2286
02:04:19,990 --> 02:04:21,790
I don't know all of them, so...

2287
02:04:21,790 --> 02:04:23,890
Oh my gosh, there's Steven's songs from the musical.

2288
02:04:26,130 --> 02:04:29,010
This one is credited to SpongeBob and Plankton.

2289
02:04:31,030 --> 02:04:33,550
This one is credited to SpongeBob and Plankton.

2290
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:34,590
This one is credited to SpongeBob and Plankton.

2291
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:35,390
It's not about winning.

2292
02:04:35,530 --> 02:04:36,630
It's about fun!

2293
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:37,810
Watch that.

2294
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:38,930
Wait, I need Plankton.

2295
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:40,370
Fun is when you...

2296
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:41,470
Fun is...

2297
02:04:41,470 --> 02:04:42,770
It's like...

2298
02:04:42,770 --> 02:04:44,110
It's kind of...

2299
02:04:44,110 --> 02:04:45,910
Sort of like...

2300
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:47,430
What is fun?

2301
02:04:48,190 --> 02:04:48,750
I...

2302
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:50,550
Let me spell it out for you.

2303
02:04:50,630 --> 02:05:08,330
F is for friends who do stuff together U is for you and me N is for anywhere And anytime at all Down here in the deep blue sea F is for fire That burns down the whole town U is for uranium Bums!

2304
02:05:08,350 --> 02:05:12,570
N is for no survivors Plankton!

2305
02:05:12,570 --> 02:05:15,290
Those things aren't what fun is all about!

2306
02:05:15,650 --> 02:05:17,390
Now do it like this!

2307
02:05:17,770 --> 02:05:19,890

02:05:19,890 --> 02:05:20,210

The winner takes all It's the thrill Of one more kill The last one to fall Will never sacrifice Their will Singing

2340
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:27,320
I think it's...

2341
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:36,460
I think it's just instrumental!

2342
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:45,180
Sounds good, though.

02:12:02,940 --> 02:12:04,720
Well, they don't have is...

2348
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:10,960
Oh my gosh, the one where Mr. Krabs and Spongebob sings to each other.

2349
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:13,580
Just a rusty spoon.

2350
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:15,920
Or a spatula, or whatever.

2351
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:18,320
Yay!

2352
02:12:22,810 --> 02:12:23,490
Let's...

2353
02:12:24,530 --> 02:12:25,530
Let's keep...

2354
02:12:25,530 --> 02:12:26,370
Let's keep...

2355
02:12:27,110 --> 02:12:28,150
Power washing.

2356
02:12:32,190 --> 02:12:34,250
This grill is not a grill.

2357
02:12:34,470 --> 02:12:34,670
Yeah!

2358
02:12:37,410 --> 02:12:38,750
I love that one.

2359
02:12:42,110 --> 02:12:43,690
What the hell is that?

2360
02:12:44,150 --> 02:12:45,170
Is that me?

2361
02:12:45,290 --> 02:12:47,090
I look like Spongebob, but skinny.

2362
02:12:49,650 --> 02:12:50,810
Who is that?

2363
02:12:56,410 --> 02:12:58,410
The song is called Without You.

2364
02:12:59,250 --> 02:13:01,670
I cried to that song, don't lie.

2365
02:13:04,130 --> 02:13:04,990
Conch Street.

2366
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:06,750
Bikini Bottom Boss!

2367
02:13:15,010 --> 02:13:15,690
Yippee!

2368
02:13:16,110 --> 02:13:17,550
Allow me to introduce myself.

2369
02:13:17,830 --> 02:13:18,750
Woodward Tentacles.

2370
02:13:18,990 --> 02:13:20,590
Artist extraordinaire.

2371
02:13:22,970 --> 02:13:24,330
Virtuoso clarinatista.

2372
02:13:24,890 --> 02:13:26,830
Cultivator of talent and taste.

2373
02:13:27,190 --> 02:13:28,610
Pleased to meet you.

2374
02:13:29,490 --> 02:13:34,370
I'm looking for an eensy weensy favor before you split town.

2375
02:13:34,670 --> 02:13:39,170
You see, the Bikini Bottom Gala Night is being held at Fancy.

2376
02:13:39,410 --> 02:13:46,030
This evening, and I plan to showcase some of my most accessible stand-up comedy.

2377
02:13:46,810 --> 02:13:47,090
Ha!

2378
02:13:47,310 --> 02:13:47,950
Ha!

2379
02:13:48,170 --> 02:13:48,570
Ha!

2380
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:53,850
I'll be warming up the audience with some one-liners to begin with.

2381
02:13:54,010 --> 02:13:58,090
So try to few out on the bus into town.

2382
02:13:58,930 --> 02:14:07,250
But just as I was getting into my flow state, the bus driver inexplicably let go of the wheel and covered his ears.

2383
02:14:07,390 --> 02:14:13,530
I guess he must have developed some kind of rapid-onset ear infection.

2384
02:14:14,070 --> 02:14:14,770
Ha!

2385
02:14:14,810 --> 02:14:15,530
Ha!

2386
02:14:15,890 --> 02:14:16,310
Ha!

2387
02:14:17,370 --> 02:14:22,750
Consequently, the bus carrying me had dropped the cliff.

2388
02:14:23,370 --> 02:14:24,090
Ahem.

2389
02:14:25,190 --> 02:14:25,790
Ahem.

2390
02:14:26,710 --> 02:14:27,430
Ahem.

2391
02:14:28,930 --> 02:14:30,970
And down the

2392
02:14:55,860 --> 02:15:01,820
incalculable distance into Crush County.

2393
02:15:03,080 --> 02:15:09,020
Luckily, it soft-landed into the sludge and survived the immense pressure and journey back.

2394
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:13,960
But we need to clean it up so I can ride it back in time for my set.

2395
02:15:14,180 --> 02:15:18,180
If you can fit us in, I'll tell you my best joke.

2396
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:19,100
Ha!

2397
02:15:26,490 --> 02:15:30,650
Thank you so much.

2398
02:15:30,710 --> 02:15:31,130
Thank you.

2399
02:15:31,470 --> 02:15:32,430
Let's start the job.

2400
02:15:33,790 --> 02:15:35,050
It's just a bus, right?

2401
02:15:37,250 --> 02:15:41,090
Oh my gosh!

2402
02:15:42,310 --> 02:15:45,450
Why does this look like it was drawn in like paint?

2403
02:15:46,990 --> 02:15:49,290
Is this how it actually looks in the show?

2404
02:15:49,290 --> 02:15:52,170
It looks like a five-year-old drew it.

2405
02:15:52,270 --> 02:15:53,850
This is the bus station.

2406
02:15:54,590 --> 02:15:55,810
Oh yeah!

2407
02:15:55,970 --> 02:15:56,610
The candy!

2408
02:15:57,850 --> 02:15:58,710
Kelp.

2409
02:15:58,890 --> 02:16:05,390
I can't understand what you're saying.

2410
02:16:05,950 --> 02:16:07,270
The bathroom!

2411
02:16:15,130 --> 02:16:19,840
The darkness is actually really scary.

2412
02:16:24,630 --> 02:16:26,630
The darkness is actually pretty freaky.

2413
02:16:28,630 --> 02:16:29,410
What was that?

2414
02:16:32,490 --> 02:16:33,010
Oh!

2415
02:16:33,750 --> 02:16:35,130
Okay, you're doing it.

2416
02:16:35,190 --> 02:16:35,710
Terrific.

2417
02:16:35,710 --> 02:16:37,090
Here's my best joke.

2418
02:16:37,390 --> 02:16:38,190
Oh, we're getting it!

2419
02:16:38,250 --> 02:16:38,670
We're getting it!

2420
02:16:39,950 --> 02:16:41,450
What is it, Squidward Tentacles?

2421
02:16:45,270 --> 02:16:46,130
What's the joke?

2422
02:16:47,110 --> 02:16:48,890
What if he just doesn't say anything?

2423
02:16:49,390 --> 02:16:50,410
That's the joke!

2424
02:16:51,050 --> 02:16:51,570
Thank you!

2425
02:16:51,630 --> 02:16:51,910
Thank you!

2426
02:16:52,170 --> 02:16:52,470
Kiss!

2427
02:16:52,790 --> 02:16:53,270
Kiss!

2428
02:16:56,650 --> 02:16:57,530
Advance darkness.

2429
02:16:59,730 --> 02:17:01,710
I was wondering if you could play that song again.

2430
02:17:01,750 --> 02:17:02,810
The one that goes...

2431
02:17:09,430 --> 02:17:13,290
Why do the

2432
02:17:20,420 --> 02:17:21,200
wheels have nipples?

2433
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:25,380
This one's scary.

2434
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:26,380
Where's the joke?

2435
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:28,280
He literally hasn't sent it!

2436
02:17:28,680 --> 02:17:29,900
Wait, did he send it?

2437
02:17:29,940 --> 02:17:30,360
For real?

2438
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:33,720
Oh, wait.

2439
02:17:35,540 --> 02:17:40,040
What's gray, has eight legs, nine brains, and dies after mating?

2440
02:17:41,480 --> 02:17:42,260
Oh, no.

2441
02:17:42,320 --> 02:17:43,100
Wrong book.

2442
02:17:43,380 --> 02:17:44,200
Hang on.

2443
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:58,420
Squidward's gonna die.

2444
02:17:58,640 --> 02:17:59,760
You guys, no one can...

2445
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:01,280
Squidward has to remain...

2446
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:03,660
Remain a virgin or else he'll die!

2447
02:18:04,480 --> 02:18:05,720
This is so sad!

2448
02:18:08,100 --> 02:18:09,140
Why did the...

2449
02:18:09,140 --> 02:18:09,340
Why?

2450
02:18:09,440 --> 02:18:10,220
What was...

2451
02:18:10,220 --> 02:18:12,820
What was Power Watch Simulator trying to say about that?

2452
02:18:13,020 --> 02:18:14,700
That's what I have to wonder, too.

2453
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:16,520
It's too late for him!

2454
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:18,180
Don't say that.

2455
02:18:19,980 --> 02:18:21,300
Deep SpongeBob lore.

2456
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:30,060
We must protect Squidward at all costs.

2457
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:31,120
Get him the belt.

2458
02:18:32,420 --> 02:18:34,040
Get him the virginity belt.

2459
02:18:43,180 --> 02:18:44,120
Oh, my God.

2460
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:46,040
I thought that was a creature running towards me.

2461
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:46,780
That thing right there.

2462
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:48,860
Holy cannoli.

2463
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:49,540
That scared me.

2464
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:53,260
I thought it was like a squiggly creature coming after me.

2465
02:18:57,440 --> 02:18:59,300
This episode scared me.

2466
02:19:00,360 --> 02:19:01,700
I'm scaring myself.

2467
02:19:01,980 --> 02:19:03,140
No, Speratu!

2468
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:08,520
Why is SpongeBob so funny?

2469
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:13,440
Why is SpongeBob like the funniest show...

2470
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:13,520
Oh!

2471
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:14,760
Wait a minute.

2472
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:16,000
What book was that?

2473
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:16,720
Uh-oh.

2474
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:17,960
Squidward.

2475
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:20,900
Trying to work on the side but I keep losing it.

2476
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:23,900
I'm sorry.

2477
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:28,240
It's so quotable, too.

2478
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:28,800
I know.

2479
02:19:29,740 --> 02:19:30,220
Oh.

2480
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:32,260
Life cycle of the octopus.

2481
02:19:32,620 --> 02:19:34,280
Is this someone's idea of a joke?

2482
02:19:34,300 --> 02:19:35,340
Who gave this to me?

2483
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:36,980
What did...

2484
02:19:36,980 --> 02:19:39,480
What did Power Wash Simulator mean by this?

2485
02:19:39,640 --> 02:19:39,780
I'm...

2486
02:19:39,780 --> 02:19:40,660
I'm actually...

2487
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:44,120
Power Wash Simulator.

2488
02:19:44,140 --> 02:19:45,300
Why did you teach me this?

2489
02:19:45,600 --> 02:19:47,080
Information about Squidward.

2490
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:50,620
It was a naughty book.

2491
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:56,080
Cephalopods actually have very short lifespans.

2492
02:19:56,080 --> 02:19:57,120
Don't tell me that!

2493
02:19:57,340 --> 02:19:59,060
Don't tell me that, Corrin!

2494
02:19:59,740 --> 02:20:01,140
He's gonna be okay.

2495
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:04,640
It means cinema.

2496
02:20:13,980 --> 02:20:15,100
I have growth.

2497
02:20:15,100 --> 02:20:15,580
This is not very funny.

2498
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:16,400
I'm only saying it this way, okay?

2499
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:28,680
SpongeBob Patrick-Yowie is a real thing...

2500
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:30,020
I 100% believe that.

2501
02:20:32,700 --> 02:20:35,180
I more than 100% believe that that's a thing.

2502
02:20:38,340 --> 02:20:41,020
It started to sound like Penguin from Batman.

2503
02:20:41,220 --> 02:20:41,780
kinds of things I'm talking about.

2504
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:45,100
I actually don't know what he sounds like.

2505
02:20:50,250 --> 02:20:53,030
This thing looks like the spaceship from Futurama, doesn't it?

2506
02:20:56,610 --> 02:20:58,350
Oh my god, what if we cleaned it?

2507
02:20:58,470 --> 02:20:59,710
Oh, found it.

2508
02:21:00,970 --> 02:21:02,850
What if we cleaned it and there were faces in there?

2509
02:21:02,970 --> 02:21:03,670
That'd be so scary.

2510
02:21:06,370 --> 02:21:08,210
Okay, Squidward, give us your best joke.

2511
02:21:11,030 --> 02:21:15,890
How does a pirate ask another pirate what regional accent it has?

2512
02:21:17,810 --> 02:21:18,690
How are

2513
02:21:29,850 --> 02:21:30,670
you?

2514
02:21:32,910 --> 02:21:33,350
What?

2515
02:21:38,460 --> 02:21:39,700
That doesn't make any sense.

2516
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:45,800
No, no, that's... Stay with me, stay with me.

2517
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:49,220
Oh my god, Squidward, you should just sing that.

2518
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:49,940
It'll be a big hit.

2519
02:21:50,780 --> 02:21:52,380
City pop is in, Squidward!

2520
02:22:00,410 --> 02:22:04,260
I cried, in that season.

2521
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:07,020
Now, in front of my eyes.

2522
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:09,000
Stay with me.

2523
02:22:11,530 --> 02:22:12,000
Squiddy pop?

2524
02:22:16,900 --> 02:22:22,180
Oh my god, Squiddy pop is genius.

2525
02:22:25,690 --> 02:22:27,880
Oh, here it is, my greatest joke.

2526
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:28,960
This is definitely it.

2527
02:22:29,740 --> 02:22:30,720
My life.

2528
02:22:36,020 --> 02:22:38,100
What is it, Mr. Tentacles?

2529
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:39,260
We're all waiting?

2530
02:22:40,300 --> 02:22:44,460
Which ancient cephalopod demanded a seat at King Neptune's table?

2531
02:22:46,260 --> 02:22:46,860
Which?

2532
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:51,140
Which one?

2533
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:55,260
Why is he so slow on the delivery?

2534
02:22:55,580 --> 02:22:57,140
The ammonite?

2535
02:23:00,220 --> 02:23:03,320
Uh, because it's like, I am a knight.

2536
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:10,360
I'm a knight.

2537
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:11,600
I'm a knight.

2538
02:23:12,140 --> 02:23:12,920
Get it?

2539
02:23:15,400 --> 02:23:17,200
Yeah, Squiddy, we all got it.

2540
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:19,340
We all heard your little joke.

2541
02:23:23,410 --> 02:23:24,850
We all heard it, Squidward.

2542
02:23:26,010 --> 02:23:27,310
I give up.

2543
02:23:28,090 --> 02:23:29,390
He's so talkative.

2544
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:37,480
Boo!

2545
02:23:37,780 --> 02:23:39,220
Wow, you guys actually like it?

2546
02:23:39,340 --> 02:23:39,660
Wow.

2547
02:23:41,860 --> 02:23:42,380
Okay.

2548
02:23:42,380 --> 02:23:46,160
You have particular tastes in jokes.

2549
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:46,780
I get it.

2550
02:23:46,820 --> 02:23:49,260
You know, and everybody has different senses of humor.

2551
02:23:49,460 --> 02:23:50,320
I get it.

2552
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:53,080
I liked it.

2553
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:54,140
It's like a dad joke.

2554
02:23:55,740 --> 02:23:58,020
Oh brother, this guy stinks.

2555
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:02,800
Another classic Spongebob.

2556
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:05,140
I love Spongebob so much.

2557
02:24:06,700 --> 02:24:30,220
I remember I had a friend that I would like, particularly watch Spongebob with and um, I also know, I remember, I remember this friend so distinctly too, because my mom wouldn't let me have Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but I would go to his house and I would eat the Cinnamon Toast Crunch and be like,

2558
02:24:30,300 --> 02:24:32,960
God, I wish my mom would let me have this at home.

2559
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:40,300
I'll be like, I ate probably my body's worth of Cinnamon Toast Crunch at his house.

2560
02:24:50,260 --> 02:24:50,700
I'll be like, I ate probably my body's worth of Cinnamon Toast Crunch at his house.

2561
02:24:50,700 --> 02:24:56,480
There's almost no squids in the fossil record because the high amount of ammonia in their bodies prevent them from fossilizing.

2562
02:24:56,580 --> 02:24:59,040
So we don't know much about ancient cephalopods.

2563
02:24:59,380 --> 02:25:01,880
Whoa, that's power.

2564
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:02,220
Yes, sir.

2565
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:02,920
We're back online now.

2566
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:03,940
Welcome back.

2567
02:25:04,940 --> 02:25:06,420
That's so interesting, actually.

2568
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:13,420
But now that you mentioned it, like it does, like, I don't think I've ever seen a fossil of a squid.

2569
02:25:18,470 --> 02:25:19,710
The ancient creature.

2570
02:25:20,810 --> 02:25:21,530
I

2571
02:25:30,190 --> 02:25:33,830
can't tell what's all been completed or not.

2572
02:25:34,090 --> 02:25:35,010
I think we're good there.

2573
02:25:35,890 --> 02:25:37,230
Oh, the tire.

2574
02:25:43,310 --> 02:25:44,750
Base cleaned.

2575
02:25:48,130 --> 02:25:48,850
Tire.

2576
02:25:48,850 --> 02:25:50,710
Where is still... Oh, there.

2577
02:25:54,210 --> 02:25:54,930
Nice.

2578
02:25:54,930 --> 02:25:56,090
Let's grab this.

2579
02:26:01,810 --> 02:26:02,250
Nasty.

2580
02:26:02,470 --> 02:26:03,850
I can't believe I'm walking all over this.

2581
02:26:04,950 --> 02:26:06,510
They're not very bony.

2582
02:26:06,850 --> 02:26:07,290
Yeah.

2583
02:26:09,130 --> 02:26:10,190
Just like a worm.

2584
02:26:15,180 --> 02:26:16,900
Guys, what if I became a worm tuber?

2585
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:23,500
Oh, Patrick, I used to take this bus to school every day.

2586
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:25,200
Patrick Lore?

2587
02:26:26,240 --> 02:26:27,660
What do you mean not to school?

2588
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:30,800
I can't imagine.

2589
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:31,180
Patrick Lore?

2590
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:31,180
What do you mean not to school?

2591
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:31,180
I can't imagine.

2592
02:26:32,620 --> 02:26:33,100
What?

2593
02:26:33,460 --> 02:26:35,540
Where are you going to school, Patrick Star?

2594
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:38,100
And every day I'd have to give it back?

2595
02:26:40,540 --> 02:26:41,280
What is that?

2596
02:26:41,580 --> 02:26:44,200
Oh, he's just driving it to school.

2597
02:26:44,540 --> 02:26:45,860
Patrick was a bus driver?

2598
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:50,300
Boat school, maybe?

2599
02:26:55,110 --> 02:26:55,910
Spanish school.

2600
02:26:57,630 --> 02:27:00,910
Yes, that's where Patrick Star would go every day.

2601
02:27:01,710 --> 02:27:02,670
I'm going to go to school.

2602
02:27:02,670 --> 02:27:02,930
I'm going to go to school.

2603
02:27:02,930 --> 02:27:02,930
I'm going to go to school.

2604
02:27:02,930 --> 02:27:02,930
I'm going to go to school.

2605
02:27:02,930 --> 02:27:03,610
Spanish.

2606
02:27:04,350 --> 02:27:05,190
Oh my goodness.

2607
02:27:13,950 --> 02:27:15,190
Patrick has a drivers license?

2608
02:27:15,470 --> 02:27:17,690
How does he get one before SpongeBob does?

2609
02:27:19,810 --> 02:27:25,210
One thing that I really dislike about the newer SpongeBob episodes is they really kind of ruin Patrick's character.

2610
02:27:25,950 --> 02:27:30,830
Patrick before was kind of like a lovable goof but then in the more recent episodes?

2611
02:27:30,970 --> 02:27:32,710
He's just such a jerk to SpongeBob.

2612
02:27:32,810 --> 02:27:33,650
He's just an asshole.

2613
02:27:38,020 --> 02:27:39,560
They really ruined his character.

2614
02:27:39,700 --> 02:27:40,140
This is the first time I've seen this character, I think.

2615
02:27:41,400 --> 02:27:42,860
Before he was just like a...

2616
02:27:42,860 --> 02:27:45,880
lovable guy who would make mistakes but meant well.

2617
02:27:48,100 --> 02:27:49,940
Yeah, he's just really mean now.

2618
02:27:50,480 --> 02:27:51,860
They really ruined his character.

2619
02:27:55,080 --> 02:28:00,060
Not that I've watched a lot of the new Spongebob, but I've seen like clips and stuff.

2620
02:28:00,300 --> 02:28:00,860
I'm just like, why?

2621
02:28:01,660 --> 02:28:04,100
Why'd they do him dirty like this?

2622
02:28:04,860 --> 02:28:06,280
He's just our lovable goof!

2623
02:28:12,300 --> 02:28:15,380
But also, like, you know, they weren't even supposed to continue the series.

2624
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:18,740
But after the guy passed away, he didn't want them...

2625
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:21,440
continuing, and then they were like, you know what?

2626
02:28:21,780 --> 02:28:23,140
Nah, we're gonna make...

2627
02:28:23,140 --> 02:28:25,540
We're gonna make like FIVE new series!

2628
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:26,220
Haha!

2629
02:28:30,220 --> 02:28:31,020
So sad.

2630
02:28:32,500 --> 02:28:34,540
This is what greed will do.

2631
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:36,320
Ruin a good thing.

2632
02:28:43,300 --> 02:28:49,100
A lot of Nickelodeon cartoons went down the whole turn characters into jerks route and Godparents was even worse.

2633
02:28:49,260 --> 02:28:51,660
Oh yeah, didn't they do like the Cosmo and stuff too?

2634
02:28:51,780 --> 02:28:54,800
He suddenly became like this super duper mean guy.

2635
02:28:55,980 --> 02:28:59,500
Actually, I don't know if they did it to any other characters.

2636
02:28:59,580 --> 02:29:00,620
You can tell me if they did.

2637
02:29:03,180 --> 02:29:03,540
But...

2638
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:06,360
Yeah, it just sucks so much.

2639
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:12,460
Is this one good?

2640
02:29:12,580 --> 02:29:12,760
Yep.

2641
02:29:13,340 --> 02:29:14,020
Uh, tail?

2642
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:17,520
Oh, here.

2643
02:29:18,400 --> 02:29:18,980
I think.

2644
02:29:19,320 --> 02:29:19,680
Yeah.

2645
02:29:20,380 --> 02:29:21,340
There we go.

2646
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:23,920
And... tail panel.

2647
02:29:24,780 --> 02:29:25,840
This one's good.

2648
02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:29,560
Where did I miss it at?

2649
02:29:29,740 --> 02:29:30,300
Up here?

2650
02:29:32,040 --> 02:29:32,800
Oh, here.

2651
02:29:34,340 --> 02:29:34,920
Maybe?

2652
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:36,200
Anything else?

2653
02:29:41,020 --> 02:29:42,600
Cosmo Empreg Pog!

2654
02:29:43,960 --> 02:29:45,800
Well, we know why you watched it.

2655
02:29:47,560 --> 02:29:48,400
Rear panel.

2656
02:29:51,220 --> 02:29:52,160
This one's good.

2657
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:54,580
This one...

2658
02:29:56,400 --> 02:29:57,180
Center panel.

2659
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:59,220
Gosh, there's so many tiny little bitty details.

2660
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:00,740
Oh, here.

2661
02:30:05,350 --> 02:30:07,630
I think he gets pregnant in an episode, you guys.

2662
02:30:07,850 --> 02:30:09,690
But that's like an older episode, isn't it?

2663
02:30:10,890 --> 02:30:12,130
Of the Fairly OddParents?

2664
02:30:12,230 --> 02:30:13,490
Where Cosmo becomes pregnant?

2665
02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:17,870
I say so casually, as if it's a totally normal thing.

2666
02:30:18,130 --> 02:30:19,270
But it did happen.

2667
02:30:21,290 --> 02:30:22,470
It 100% happened.

2668
02:30:22,470 --> 02:30:26,250
I say as if it's just a normal thing.

2669
02:30:26,390 --> 02:30:27,290
But it did happen.

2670
02:30:27,570 --> 02:30:28,010
I mean...

2671
02:30:28,630 --> 02:30:29,810
They're not making it up.

2672
02:30:31,970 --> 02:30:33,090
He gave birth?

2673
02:30:33,450 --> 02:30:34,350
Wait, he actually did?

2674
02:30:36,610 --> 02:30:37,810
Congratulations, Cosmo!

2675
02:30:39,670 --> 02:30:40,870
Happy birthday!

2676
02:30:42,010 --> 02:30:43,070
Happy birthday!

2677
02:30:44,010 --> 02:30:47,870
Happy birthday!

2678
02:30:48,770 --> 02:30:49,930
This one?

2679
02:30:50,370 --> 02:30:54,510
I don't like the noises in this one.

2680
02:30:54,590 --> 02:30:55,710
It's freaking me out a little bit.

2681
02:31:00,050 --> 02:31:00,870
Window frame.

2682
02:31:01,570 --> 02:31:03,390
The window frame is still quite dirty.

2683
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:12,070
Door is good.

2684
02:31:13,890 --> 02:31:15,190
The window frames.

2685
02:31:17,330 --> 02:31:18,730
Let's try it with this instead.

2686
02:31:20,530 --> 02:31:22,230
Maybe I can reach from here.

2687
02:31:22,230 --> 02:31:24,090
I gotta get out of here!

2688
02:31:25,770 --> 02:31:27,170
I'll never make it home!

2689
02:31:27,750 --> 02:31:32,680
I'll never make it home!

2690
02:31:32,680 --> 02:31:33,140
Never mind.

2691
02:31:33,300 --> 02:31:34,380
Let's use the stairs.

2692
02:31:34,700 --> 02:31:35,760
Or the ladder.

2693
02:31:38,660 --> 02:31:43,380
Do you remember when Jimmy Neutron had a episode where Carl got butt-pregged by an alien?

2694
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:46,440
I think I do remember that.

2695
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:48,720
And like, Sheen was just like our baby.

2696
02:31:50,180 --> 02:31:51,260
What is up with...

2697
02:31:51,260 --> 02:31:53,320
What happened in that era?

2698
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:54,660
What happened in that era?

2699
02:31:56,040 --> 02:31:56,720
And...

2700
02:31:56,720 --> 02:31:59,300
I remember Carl was just like...

2701
02:31:59,300 --> 02:32:00,260
Sheen...

2702
02:32:00,260 --> 02:32:01,200
It's time.

2703
02:32:01,780 --> 02:32:03,240
And Sheen's just like...

2704
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:04,460
The baby!

2705
02:32:14,740 --> 02:32:15,820
Yeah, I remember.

2706
02:32:17,060 --> 02:32:19,540
I watched a lot of Nicktoons when I was a kid.

2707
02:32:21,220 --> 02:32:22,660
Cause I hated...

2708
02:32:22,660 --> 02:32:24,260
Well, also I didn't have Disney.

2709
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:26,200
Couldn't afford it.

2710
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:28,220
So instead...

2711
02:32:28,660 --> 02:32:30,120
I had just Nicktoons.

2712
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:32,140
And uh...

2713
02:32:32,840 --> 02:32:35,060
Cause Disney was on the more expensive channel.

2714
02:32:35,240 --> 02:32:36,040
Thanks a whole lot.

2715
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:37,620
Very kid-friendly of you Disney.

2716
02:32:37,900 --> 02:32:39,900
Allowing everyone to have access to your channel!

2717
02:32:42,040 --> 02:32:42,480
Um...

2718
02:32:45,100 --> 02:32:45,980
But um...

2719
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:48,000
Headlights.

2720
02:32:50,320 --> 02:32:50,840
This one?

2721
02:32:51,800 --> 02:32:52,240
Yeah.

2722
02:32:53,340 --> 02:32:54,060
But uh...

2723
02:32:54,060 --> 02:32:55,980
But I didn't want to watch real people anyway.

2724
02:32:56,140 --> 02:32:57,700
Cause real people suck.

2725
02:32:58,460 --> 02:32:59,940
I only wanted to watch cartoons.

2726
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:02,600
So I watched a lot of Cartoon Network and a lot of Nicktoons.

2727
02:33:04,360 --> 02:33:05,240
There we go!

2728
02:33:06,020 --> 02:33:06,920
What's next?

2729
02:33:07,340 --> 02:33:08,440
Base panels.

2730
02:33:13,450 --> 02:33:14,470
Oh, here.

2731
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:15,970
Oh wow!

2732
02:33:16,090 --> 02:33:16,710
That's dirty!

2733
02:33:17,610 --> 02:33:18,290
Oh my gosh!

2734
02:33:18,310 --> 02:33:19,310
We missed so much of it.

2735
02:33:22,730 --> 02:33:23,810
Center panel.

2736
02:33:24,490 --> 02:33:25,350
Oh, here.

2737
02:33:28,750 --> 02:33:29,430
Uh...

2738
02:33:29,430 --> 02:33:30,050
Oh, here.

2739
02:33:40,320 --> 02:33:42,580
Cartoon Network's weird live action phase.

2740
02:33:42,700 --> 02:33:42,880
Yeah!

2741
02:33:44,020 --> 02:33:44,280
How did they do that?

2742
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:47,020
It's like they forgot who they were.

2743
02:33:47,860 --> 02:33:48,980
It's Cartoon Network.

2744
02:33:49,580 --> 02:33:50,200
Thank you!

2745
02:33:50,260 --> 02:33:50,480
Thank you!

2746
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,160
I don't know if it's any of the case.

2747
02:33:53,380 --> 02:33:55,840
I just want to kind of hang out with Mint and Wonko.

2748
02:33:57,360 --> 02:33:57,920
Chimmy's mom.

2749
02:33:59,940 --> 02:34:00,520
Chimmy's mom.

2750
02:34:02,180 --> 02:34:02,620
Um...

2751
02:34:02,620 --> 02:34:04,420
Then it like turned into...

2752
02:34:04,420 --> 02:34:05,360
Wait, what was this one called?

2753
02:34:05,560 --> 02:34:06,100
Rear panel.

2754
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:08,480
Then it suddenly turned into like...

2755
02:34:08,480 --> 02:34:10,120
I don't know if it's still the case.

2756
02:34:10,280 --> 02:34:13,080
But it was like Teen Titans go for everything.

2757
02:34:14,120 --> 02:34:15,720
Teen Titans go tomorrow.

2758
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,400
Teen Titans go today.

2759
02:34:18,320 --> 02:34:20,180
Teen Titans go every day.

2760
02:34:24,080 --> 02:34:24,800
There we go.

2761
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:27,000
We're almost there.

2762
02:34:27,320 --> 02:34:28,000
This one.

2763
02:34:32,010 --> 02:34:33,010
I can make it.

2764
02:34:33,090 --> 02:34:33,550
I can make it.

2765
02:34:34,250 --> 02:34:35,330
I can make it.

2766
02:34:42,530 --> 02:34:44,650
Can't tell where it's dirty at though.

2767
02:34:47,530 --> 02:34:49,690
I was thinking of Teen Titans the other day.

2768
02:34:49,730 --> 02:34:50,290
And I don't know why.

2769
02:34:54,490 --> 02:34:56,010
Did they ever finish it?

2770
02:34:56,170 --> 02:34:58,930
Like was it one of those shows that remained kind of incomplete?

2771
02:34:59,850 --> 02:35:00,930
Where am I remiss...

2772
02:35:00,930 --> 02:35:02,710
Am I misremembering?

2773
02:35:03,810 --> 02:35:04,210
Oh!

2774
02:35:04,230 --> 02:35:05,450
Maybe I got this one.

2775
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:06,870
Nope, never mind.

2776
02:35:09,830 --> 02:35:10,950
Oh, they did get a finale.

2777
02:35:11,310 --> 02:35:11,610
Okay.

2778
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:18,240
What is...

2779
02:35:18,240 --> 02:35:19,300
What am I missing here?

2780
02:35:23,100 --> 02:35:24,500
An open ending.

2781
02:35:27,380 --> 02:35:28,860
An open ending.

2782
02:35:28,860 --> 02:35:29,020
Yeah.

2783
02:35:30,420 --> 02:35:31,420
Open ending.

2784
02:35:32,840 --> 02:35:34,300
That's what they're calling it.

2785
02:35:36,900 --> 02:35:38,760
What am I missing on this one?

2786
02:35:48,460 --> 02:35:50,100
I pressed the thing.

2787
02:35:50,200 --> 02:35:50,940
Oh there, finally.

2788
02:35:52,520 --> 02:35:54,020
And then here.

2789
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:56,420
These two.

2790
02:35:56,620 --> 02:35:57,220
These two.

2791
02:35:59,720 --> 02:36:02,000
Yeah, I was thinking about Teen Titans the other day.

2792
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:02,780
Just like...

2793
02:36:03,320 --> 02:36:04,960
You know, I used to like it a lot.

2794
02:36:05,140 --> 02:36:06,280
But I never finished it.

2795
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,260
Kind of glad I did though.

2796
02:36:09,440 --> 02:36:09,880
Alright.

2797
02:36:10,760 --> 02:36:11,820
Just two more things.

2798
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:12,800
Inner wheels.

2799
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:15,400
Oh, shoot.

2800
02:36:16,140 --> 02:36:17,660
Wait, how am I supposed to see this?

2801
02:36:18,820 --> 02:36:20,180
They did get a mini movie.

2802
02:36:21,880 --> 02:36:24,140
Where Starfire and Robin finally got together.

2803
02:36:24,180 --> 02:36:25,840
So the most important part of the show got resolved.

2804
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:26,800
At least.

2805
02:36:26,800 --> 02:36:28,640
That's not what I cared about!

2806
02:36:30,860 --> 02:36:34,200
I was actually super invested in like the Slade...

2807
02:36:35,140 --> 02:36:35,920
What's her name?

2808
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,520
Tara... whole thing.

2809
02:36:38,580 --> 02:36:40,080
And her and Beast Boy.

2810
02:36:48,100 --> 02:36:48,420
Oh!

2811
02:36:49,580 --> 02:36:50,400
There we go.

2812
02:36:52,120 --> 02:36:52,760
Terra!

2813
02:36:53,260 --> 02:36:54,700
Yeah, Terra.

2814
02:36:56,600 --> 02:36:58,000
Wind scream frame?

2815
02:36:58,220 --> 02:36:58,560
What's that?

2816
02:37:00,060 --> 02:37:00,860
Oh, here.

2817
02:37:12,740 --> 02:37:13,740
Oh, I think...

2818
02:37:13,740 --> 02:37:14,600
I see where it is.

2819
02:37:19,160 --> 02:37:20,940
Just wanted Beast Boy to be happy.

2820
02:37:21,920 --> 02:37:23,460
I liked Beast Boy a lot.

2821
02:37:23,700 --> 02:37:24,540
I liked him.

2822
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:27,540
I think I liked everybody but Robin.

2823
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:31,780
Sorry, Robin.

2824
02:37:32,760 --> 02:37:34,740
I liked everybody but Robin.

2825
02:37:34,980 --> 02:37:36,760
I liked Raven a lot, obviously.

2826
02:37:39,500 --> 02:37:40,020
Yay!

2827
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,260
Complete the Bikini Bottom bus job!

2828
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:45,940
Yippee!

2829
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,140
Oh my gosh.

2830
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:51,720
What is...

2831
02:37:51,720 --> 02:37:53,060
I even have the SpongeBob face!

2832
02:37:54,100 --> 02:37:55,140
I'm a fish!

2833
02:37:55,440 --> 02:37:57,200
I'm not SpongeBob, I'm a fish!

2834
02:38:01,760 --> 02:38:03,740
I never thought I'd say this.

2835
02:38:03,960 --> 02:38:06,840
But that looks as good as new if not better.

2836
02:38:07,140 --> 02:38:14,960
Thanks to you, the people of Bikini Bottom can get a real taste of what Thanks to you, the people of Bikini Bottom can get a real taste of what sophisticated humor and songs should sound like.

2837
02:38:16,980 --> 02:38:17,540
Huh!

2838
02:38:18,060 --> 02:38:21,560
The Krusty Kruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuv!

2839
02:38:22,820 --> 02:38:24,080
Krusty Kruv Pizza!

2840
02:38:24,300 --> 02:38:25,480
Is a pizza!

2841
02:38:25,660 --> 02:38:26,800
For you and me!

2842
02:38:42,340 --> 02:38:42,900
Plankton!

2843
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:44,360
What are you doing?

2844
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:46,660
Oh gosh, I'm thinking of the AI Plankton now.

2845
02:38:47,620 --> 02:38:48,700
Where is the Chum...

2846
02:38:48,700 --> 02:38:49,980
The Chum Bucket!

2847
02:38:49,980 --> 02:38:50,640
It's right there!

2848
02:38:56,310 --> 02:39:00,070
I love how Robin dunks on TT Go, Let's go Robin in the movie.

2849
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:01,870
Does he really?

2850
02:39:24,950 --> 02:39:25,690
You

2851
02:39:52,690 --> 02:39:57,710
guys are talking to me as if I'm like...

2852
02:39:57,710 --> 02:40:00,970
You guys always

2853
02:40:10,020 --> 02:40:11,300
ruin my fun.

2854
02:40:19,340 --> 02:40:21,630
You guys always ruin my fun.

2855
02:40:32,060 --> 02:40:34,920
It just stands out so much.

2856
02:40:37,860 --> 02:40:38,700
Oh my gosh.

2857
02:40:38,740 --> 02:40:39,120
Oh my gosh.

2858
02:40:39,140 --> 02:40:41,080
I can live my dream of being in the clam.

2859
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:43,000
Oh my god.

2860
02:40:43,020 --> 02:40:43,440
Oh my god.

2861
02:40:43,460 --> 02:40:43,880
Oh my god.

2862
02:40:43,880 --> 02:40:44,320
Oh my god.

2863
02:40:44,320 --> 02:40:44,760
Oh my god.

2864
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:45,180
Oh my god.

2865
02:40:45,200 --> 02:40:45,600
Oh my god.

2866
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:46,740
I can be in the clam.

2867
02:40:46,860 --> 02:40:47,620
I can be in the clam.

2868
02:40:48,200 --> 02:40:49,080
Oh my god.

2869
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:49,480
Oh my god.

2870
02:40:49,500 --> 02:40:49,880
Oh my god.

2871
02:40:49,900 --> 02:40:50,240
Oh my god.

2872
02:40:53,380 --> 02:40:54,660
Introducing Myoshi to my friends.

2873
02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:56,000
Myoshi, see your bucket.

2874
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:57,220
Me surprise Pikachu.

2875
02:40:57,900 --> 02:40:58,220
No!

2876
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:02,020
Do I admit giving to the dark side?

2877
02:41:03,340 --> 02:41:03,660
See.

2878
02:41:18,780 --> 02:41:20,420
The Krusty Krab.

2879
02:41:24,890 --> 02:41:26,990
I've always wanted to be in this show.

2880
02:41:31,890 --> 02:41:33,690
The Chu幸 게

2881
02:41:42,940 --> 02:41:44,400
Meant to do it with...

2882
02:41:47,020 --> 02:41:48,820
Oh my god.

2883
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:51,740
Krusty Krab.

2884
02:41:51,780 --> 02:41:53,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2885
02:41:54,100 --> 02:41:55,420
Yeah, yeah...

2886
02:41:55,420 --> 02:41:56,160
I am pizza.

2887
02:41:57,080 --> 02:42:01,240
Here's the pizza for you and... me.

2888
02:42:10,090 --> 02:42:12,120
I would go to the chew bucket every day.

2889
02:42:21,940 --> 02:42:24,120
It's such a low hanging fruit, you know?

2890
02:42:36,970 --> 02:42:38,270
Don't clam up.

2891
02:42:38,930 --> 02:42:40,330
It's just too easy.

2892
02:42:44,320 --> 02:42:45,940
Literally low hanging.

2893
02:42:59,160 --> 02:43:00,900
Can't even see where the H is here.

2894
02:43:01,340 --> 02:43:03,300
Wait, oh there.

2895
02:43:09,090 --> 02:43:09,970
Duh.

2896
02:43:15,090 --> 02:43:17,650
Bet you didn't expect this one.

2897
02:43:18,090 --> 02:43:20,670
It ain't the Krusty Krab anymore.

2898
02:43:21,370 --> 02:43:24,470
It's the Rusty Krab.

2899
02:43:25,130 --> 02:43:25,930
The

2900
02:43:35,940 --> 02:43:38,780
Rusty Krab.

2901
02:43:53,940 --> 02:43:55,920
Look, they write it just like I do.

2902
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:23,420
Gosh, bikini bottoms really...

2903
02:44:24,940 --> 02:44:25,780
Oh my gosh.

2904
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:26,980
This is where the bad...

2905
02:44:26,980 --> 02:44:28,000
The bad...

2906
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,220
Krab smells!

2907
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:32,660
This is where all the... they learn the bad words.

2908
02:44:33,460 --> 02:44:34,620
Fred was here...

2909
02:44:35,300 --> 02:44:36,260
The dolphin.

2910
02:44:38,860 --> 02:44:39,660
Nemo Toads.

2911
02:44:40,900 --> 02:44:42,620
Nemo Toads are people too.

2912
02:44:42,620 --> 02:44:45,220
And then Handsome Squidward.

2913
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:50,200
Krab smells...

2914
02:44:52,700 --> 02:44:53,280
Good.

2915
02:45:02,820 --> 02:45:04,600
Not Handsome Squidward.

2916
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:05,180
Oh wait, here.

2917
02:45:05,780 --> 02:45:07,960
Ravioli, ravioli, give me the formioli.

2918
02:45:08,100 --> 02:45:08,540
Fun!

2919
02:45:08,940 --> 02:45:11,380
And this... oh my gosh, this is just full of references.

2920
02:45:12,200 --> 02:45:13,140
Barnacle Head.

2921
02:45:15,640 --> 02:45:17,800
Star... I don't know this one actually.

2922
02:45:17,960 --> 02:45:18,840
I don't get this one.

2923
02:45:19,520 --> 02:45:21,120
Camp Coral For Life.

2924
02:45:22,360 --> 02:45:24,060
Dogfish Hearts Catfish.

2925
02:45:44,730 --> 02:45:46,090
Oh my god.

2926
02:45:48,030 --> 02:45:49,610
There, okay.

2927
02:45:51,990 --> 02:45:53,290
Oh, it gets rid of it!

2928
02:45:53,810 --> 02:45:54,590
Oh no!

2929
02:45:55,210 --> 02:45:59,790
Okay guys, I guess I can't clean this place because it's just too sad to get rid of everything here.

2930
02:45:59,790 --> 02:46:02,130
And there's even mayonnaise in there!

2931
02:46:03,170 --> 02:46:04,690
Eat up, eat up, eat up!

2932
02:46:05,870 --> 02:46:07,210
Here, I'll clean it off for you.

2933
02:46:09,250 --> 02:46:10,210
It's still good.

2934
02:46:10,610 --> 02:46:13,110
Mr. Krabs would totally eat this up.

2935
02:46:13,750 --> 02:46:15,510
Mr. Krabs would say it's totally fine.

2936
02:46:22,170 --> 02:46:23,290
Mayonnaise doesn't go bad.

2937
02:46:27,110 --> 02:46:28,530
I can't clean this place.

2938
02:46:29,330 --> 02:46:31,270
It's filled with too much goodness.

2939
02:46:33,750 --> 02:46:35,530
It even has the dolphin!

2940
02:46:35,750 --> 02:46:37,370
This is where they learned how to do it.

2941
02:46:41,130 --> 02:46:42,230
What did I just say?

2942
02:46:43,170 --> 02:46:44,230
Don't cancel us.

2943
02:46:44,710 --> 02:46:45,690
Don't cancel me.

2944
02:46:48,270 --> 02:46:49,230
Thank you!

2945
02:46:49,710 --> 02:46:51,150
Is this the Rusty Crab?

2946
02:46:51,390 --> 02:46:52,510
No, this is Minto.

2947
02:46:54,530 --> 02:46:58,410
Hold on, let's draw Minto on the Chum Bucket.

2948
02:47:01,090 --> 02:47:02,230
It's against TOS?

2949
02:47:03,750 --> 02:47:05,490
They can't stop me!

2950
02:47:05,550 --> 02:47:06,590
They'll never catch me alive!

2951
02:47:27,970 --> 02:47:29,950
I ran out of water for a second.

2952
02:47:36,380 --> 02:47:37,660
My head's a little...

2953
02:47:37,660 --> 02:47:38,060
It's okay.

2954
02:47:39,360 --> 02:47:40,100
It's okay.

2955
02:47:41,160 --> 02:47:41,960
It's fine.

2956
02:47:42,880 --> 02:47:43,680
It's fine.

2957
02:47:46,380 --> 02:47:47,140
It's my headband.

2958
02:47:52,460 --> 02:47:53,660
Minto was here!

2959
02:49:07,880 --> 02:49:08,960
Let's play!

2960
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:10,160
Wheel!

2961
02:49:12,970 --> 02:49:16,130
Would you like to solve the puzzle?

2962
02:49:16,230 --> 02:49:17,930
Or would you like to buy a vowel?

2963
02:49:42,670 --> 02:49:43,470
You?

2964
02:49:46,330 --> 02:49:47,650
There's no you!

2965
02:49:48,950 --> 02:49:51,410
The correct answer was...

2966
02:49:56,420 --> 02:49:58,900
The Clam Bucket!

2967
02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:01,820
Thanks for playing!

2968
02:50:12,160 --> 02:50:14,300
Anyways guys, this was a lot of fun.

2969
02:50:14,780 --> 02:50:18,920
Thanks for hanging out with me while I clean the...

2970
02:50:18,920 --> 02:50:19,800
Hold on, look at this.

2971
02:50:22,080 --> 02:50:24,180
Oh my god, I almost just choked.

2972
02:50:30,490 --> 02:50:44,610
I walk a lonely road The only one that I have ever known Don't know where it goes But it's only me and I walk alone Bow-wow!

2973
02:50:54,330 --> 02:50:56,530
Did you ever play Battle for Bikini Bottom?

2974
02:50:56,590 --> 02:50:59,070
Starting to think you might like that one.

2975
02:50:59,110 --> 02:51:00,690
If not, I don't think I did actually.

2976
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:09,730
Thank you guys for hanging out with me today!

2977
02:51:10,070 --> 02:51:12,250
And talking about Spongebob a lot.

2978
02:51:12,650 --> 02:51:13,970
Nicktoons and things like that.

2979
02:51:14,190 --> 02:51:15,510
This was such a fun DLC.

2980
02:51:16,190 --> 02:51:17,590
I don't know if...

2981
02:51:18,970 --> 02:51:20,670
If this is the last one or not.

2982
02:51:20,730 --> 02:51:21,950
It seems to be because it's the biggest.

2983
02:51:21,950 --> 02:51:22,570
So...

2984
02:51:22,570 --> 02:51:24,330
But I had a lot of fun!

2985
02:51:25,770 --> 02:51:28,770
And I hope that you guys did too!

2986
02:51:30,150 --> 02:51:34,870
And I will see you guys tomorrow for whatever I decide to stream!

2987
02:51:36,250 --> 02:51:39,290
If I don't see you tomorrow, then I'll see you when I next see you!

2988
02:51:41,290 --> 02:51:44,370
Yeah, I'm still working on my schedule.

2989
02:51:44,590 --> 02:51:45,110
Sorry.

2990
02:51:45,790 --> 02:51:47,390
I'm figuring it out.

2991
02:51:48,330 --> 02:51:49,670
I'm figuring it out.

2992
02:51:51,950 --> 02:51:54,530
I'm pressing the left mouse button, but it's not shooting the ghost.

2993
02:51:56,490 --> 02:51:58,190
I love non-demo streams.

2994
02:51:58,790 --> 02:51:59,190
Yeah!

2995
02:52:00,190 --> 02:52:01,850
I think it'll be a game.

2996
02:52:02,070 --> 02:52:03,530
I'm trying to decide what game.

2997
02:52:05,610 --> 02:52:06,570
Anyways, Otsumito!

2998
02:52:07,830 --> 02:52:08,310
Itterashiaimasen!

2999
02:52:08,310 --> 02:52:09,070
Oshimin-sama!

3000
02:52:09,310 --> 02:52:10,070
Ojo-sama!

3001
02:52:10,310 --> 02:52:12,730
Thank you so much for hanging out with me.

3002
02:52:12,810 --> 02:52:14,650
And I'll see you guys later!
