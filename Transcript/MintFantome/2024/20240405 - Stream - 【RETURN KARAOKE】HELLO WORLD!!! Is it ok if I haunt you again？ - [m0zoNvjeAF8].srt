1
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,080
Oh no, wait, I actually forgot something.

2
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,140
Thank you.

3
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,140
Oh no, wait, I forgot something.

4
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,340
Stop, I forgot.

5
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,040
Wait, no, no, no, I just realized now.

6
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,580
Oh my gosh, why am I just realizing now?

7
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:05,920
Oh, I forgot my noise gain.

8
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,840
Thank you, thank you.

9
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,060
Oh, shoot.

10
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,120
It's fine for today.

11
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,880
It's fine for today probably.

12
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,820
Hello.

13
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,040
Oh my god.

14
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,380
Hello.

15
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,240
You're a super...

16
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,860
Oh my god.

17
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,600
I didn't think, I didn't think I...

18
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,560
Oh gosh.

19
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,140
You guys, the main cafe is so messy.

20
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,020
No one has paid the power bill.

21
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,620
It's so...

22
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,080
There's not even any lights on.

23
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,120
There's cobwebs even.

24
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,080
I haven't had a chance to really clean up.

25
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,700
I didn't think anybody would be back here.

26
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,020
You know, I...

27
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,860
You're a super...

28
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,940
You're a super...

29
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,280
You're a super...

30
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,140
Hello.

31
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,160
Hi.

32
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,120
You're a super...

33
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,060
You can help me clean it?

34
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,380
You can?

35
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,220
Help me clean it?

36
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,560
You're a super...

37
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,420
Maybe I should turn off the note if so.

38
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,640
I'll turn them off for karaoke later.

39
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,040
Thank you, thank you.

40
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,040
Give me, give me, give me, give me a second.

41
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,560
Hi...

42
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,520
Hold on.

43
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,740
Okay.

44
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,680
Okay, I got it.

45
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,100
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

46
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,040
Okay, okay, okay.

47
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,340
I think I'm...

48
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,460
Uh...

49
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,900
H-okay...

50
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,020
Ah...

51
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,220
Ah...

52
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,560
Ah...

53
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,340
Huh...

54
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,900
Ha...

55
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,000
Ha...

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,240
Ha...

57
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,380
Ha...

58
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,080
Thank you, thank you.

59
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,840
Chuu.

60
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,460
Hello!

61
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,400
Welcome back!

62
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:22,880
Master!

63
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,120
Lady!

64
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,780
Welcome to my...

65
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,060
bed...

66
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:28,880
cafe!

67
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,400
Well, hold on, hold on.

68
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:30,900
Hold on.

69
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,760
Hold on.

70
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,320
Hold on.

71
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,320
I have my...

72
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,880
I have my trusty broom here.

73
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,660
I have my trusty broom here.

74
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,060
So we can...

75
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,560
We can...

76
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,180
clean up the cobwebs, right?

77
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,460
See?

78
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:45,720
You see it?

79
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,980
You see it?

80
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,340
Okay.

81
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,760
Hold on, hold on.

82
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,620
Okay.

83
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,480
Yay!

84
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,320
Okay, let's get the other side.

85
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,060
It looks like I'm...

86
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,940
sweeping up the...

87
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,600
nodefs.

88
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,160
Get out of here!

89
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,340
Get out of here!

90
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,700
Wait, where is it?

91
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,660
This one.

92
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,580
Yay!

93
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,400
Okay, now I can...

94
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,260
throw it away.

95
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,820
Into the garbage.

96
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,080
There it goes.

97
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,680
I never need to clean again.

98
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,000
Arigato Arigato-chu.

99
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,880
Arigato Arigato-chu.

100
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,220
Arigato Arigato-chu.

101
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,660
Arigato Arigato-chu.

102
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,540
Oh my gosh.

103
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,840
This is already...

104
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,440
It's too much.

105
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,260
That's too much already.

106
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,460
It's too much already.

107
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,680
Thanks for cleaning up.

108
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,580
You're welcome!

109
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,380
Yeah!

110
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
Nice and...

111
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:13,960
refreshed...

112
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,260
in here now.

113
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,840
Except... except it's kind of dark.

114
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,220
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,600
Again, I haven't... I'm just the ghost haunting here.

116
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,880
I don't pay the bills.

117
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,940
I truly think this place was abandoned.

118
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
Aren't your hands tired?

119
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,980
No, my hands are like this!

120
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,400
Because I'm a ghost.

121
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,560
It's just naturally up.

122
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,240
Why?

123
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,440
Do you want me to put my hands down?

124
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,220
It's really cursed.

125
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,240
It's perhaps more cursed than if my hands are up.

126
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,940
To be honest.

127
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,280
Do you want to see?

128
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,500
Do you... want to see my hands down?

129
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,600
You want to see?

130
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,300
My hands down?

131
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,420
Oh my god.

132
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,580
Your house.

133
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,920
Oh wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

134
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,820
I have something for this instead.

135
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,960
I just flew in here and... boy, are my arms tired.

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,580
That's it.

137
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,560
That's all I got.

138
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,900
You can go home now.

139
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:41,940
Boo!

140
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh my gosh!

141
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,880
You guys love it!

142
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,280
Thank you!

143
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,280
Yes!

144
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,520
Boo!

145
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,280
Boo!

146
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,540
Boo!

147
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,480
Yes, yes, yes!

148
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,600
Yes, I'm a ghost!

149
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,120
Boo!

150
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,040
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

151
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,780
You guys get it!

152
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,660
Yes, you guys love it!

153
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,460
You guys love it!

154
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,360
I knew it!

155
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,840
I knew it!

156
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,160
I knew you guys would be... would be...

157
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,800
Patrons of good cultured taste, I had a feeling.

158
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,040
Memberships when?

159
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,080
I saw multiple people asking before stream even.

160
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,780
If I was gonna open up memberships but...

161
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,920
I can't do anything.

162
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,280
I can't have super chats.

163
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,260
I can't have...

164
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,920
I can't have...

165
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,240
Hold on, I don't like this anymore.

166
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,920
I can't have memberships.

167
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,800
I can't have super chats.

168
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,040
Until I have three videos uploaded.

169
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,400
So today is my first video.

170
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,480
So after three streams...

171
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,540
Most likely.

172
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,440
Most likely.

173
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,700
I think.

174
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,940
Probably.

175
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,800
Anyways, hello.

176
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,340
Thank you.

177
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,460
You're a simp.

178
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,720
Gosh, my...

179
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,440
It's so weird hearing these don't know sounds.

180
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,940
They're from three years ago.

181
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,660
It's so weird hearing them.

182
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,340
Oh my gosh, it's so weird being here.

183
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,920
It's so weird.

184
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh, I was gonna introduce her.

185
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,600
You're a simp.

186
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,880
I was gonna introduce myself, yes.

187
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,880
Because I think there's many people here that...

188
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,280
Thank you, thank you.

189
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,400
That...

190
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,520
I...

191
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,980
That don't know me.

192
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,380
Because there's a lot of people that I don't know either.

193
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,500
But back in the day, I was...

194
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,560
I was just a, you know, teeny tiny spirit.

195
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,200
So now...

196
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,540
I think...

197
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,240
My maid cafe is at max capacity.

198
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,100
There's like a five hour waiting line.

199
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,860
It's Disney World up in here.

200
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,820
I only know her from the podcast.

201
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,480
Thanks for listening.

202
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,120
Thank you.

203
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:57,820
Yes.

204
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,600
I am...

205
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,780
I'm back because Matara summoned me.

206
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,800
Oh, goodness gracious.

207
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,940
Arigato.

208
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,400
Arigato.

209
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,080
Thank you so much.

210
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,660
I really appreciate all the donuts.

211
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,420
Thank you guys.

212
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:09,840
Thank you.

213
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,180
Thank you.

214
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,320
I will turn off the Dono sounds eventually.

215
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,800
Because we'll be doing karaoke later, so...

216
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,740
But yeah, Matara summoned me for a podcast.

217
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,080
And now I'm back haunting you.

218
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,000
Arigato.

219
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,400
Arigato.

220
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,620
What else?

221
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,340
What else?

222
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,420
Oh, my name is Mint.

223
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,860
My name is...

224
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,040
My name is... My name is Mint.

225
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,520
Phantom.

226
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,520
Minto.

227
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,720
That's me.

228
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,200
Watashi.

229
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,660
Watashi no namae wa.

230
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,540
Watakushi no namae wa.

231
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,680
Minto to moshimasu.

232
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,660
I have to speak in Keigo because because I'm the maid.

233
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,780
I'm the lowly maid.

234
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,180
And you guys are the goshijinsama and ojousama.

235
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,080
Yep.

236
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, gosh.

237
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,660
I have to serve you guys.

238
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,360
Yeesh.

239
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,780
Age hasn't slowed you down one bit.

240
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,640
Thank you.

241
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,960
Does that one say you're a soup?

242
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,620
No.

243
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,100
I don't remember why I made it.

244
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,940
It was you're a simp.

245
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,420
I think it was from Seigi.

246
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,160
Thank you.

247
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,500
Thank you.

248
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,700
You guys, I'm back and all my friends are gone.

249
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,780
Well, not all of them.

250
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,660
But a lot of my friends are gone.

251
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,380
A lot of things have changed in the three years.

252
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,720
It was Seigi.

253
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,720
Yeah, it was Seigi.

254
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,280
Wasn't it?

255
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,740
A lot of things have changed in three years.

256
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:15,120
But I think I think I can say I think I can say I'm still me.

257
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,420
Right?

258
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,060
I think I can say that.

259
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,380
Thank you.

260
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:19,680
Thank you.

261
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,060
I think.

262
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,840
I think I can say I'm still I'm still minty fresh.

263
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,000
You're a soup.

264
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,020
You're a soup.

265
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:31,980
You're a soup.

266
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,220
Despite everything, maybe.

267
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:36,900
Amori!

268
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,740
Oh.

269
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,420
Thank you.

270
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,700
Thank you.

271
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,260
Happy to have you back.

272
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,120
Yeah!

273
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,220
Sorry.

274
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,880
I'm getting... I'm working over a cold.

275
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:54,660
So maybe actually today's not the best day to sing but I don't know.

276
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,940
I didn't know what else to do.

277
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,560
So I thought maybe singing would...

278
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,960
kind of...

279
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,200
Oh gosh.

280
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:02,800
Sorry.

281
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,480
Okay.

282
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:18,280
I'm gonna turn off the notification sounds because I think it's a little overwhelming when it's only streamlabs and no and no superchats because I don't usually turn on sounds for superchats.

283
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,520
Okay.

284
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,520
Thank you.

285
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,620
Thank you.

286
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,440
I had a great grand nostalgia hearing all these sounds.

287
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,520
I hope you guys did too.

288
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,020
Okay.

289
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,340
Okay.

290
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,780
Congrats on coming back.

291
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,340
Thank you!

292
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,140
Thank you so much.

293
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,980
Maybe it's a backlog.

294
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,400
There!

295
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,880
Sorry.

296
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,920
There are many messages.

297
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,220
I will read them.

298
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,400
Oh.

299
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,000
Hey.

300
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,240
Wait.

301
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,500
Wait.

302
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:55,900
Wait a second.

303
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,520
Oh.

304
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:56,960
Wait.

305
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,700
I think it's a...

306
00:15:59,480 --> 00:15:59,880
Okay.

307
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,880
Now I think it's done.

308
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,600
Unless it's just a backlog.

309
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,120
Sorry.

310
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,020
I said there would be a little bit of scuff.

311
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,600
Yay!

312
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,880
You're a soup.

313
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,080
Soup.

314
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,420
Soup.

315
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,060
What kind of soup?

316
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,600
What kind of soup?

317
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,920
Chicken and... Chicken...

318
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,180
No.

319
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,680
Hold on.

320
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,040
I used to...

321
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,600
I used to love the cream of chicken.

322
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,060
Mint soup?

323
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,540
Corns!

324
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
Corn soup.

325
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:48,940
Yes!

326
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,560
Yes.

327
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:50,940
Yes.

328
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,280
Yes.

329
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,440
My favorite.

330
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,380
How did you know?

331
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,100
How did you know?

332
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,460
Oh my gosh.

333
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,980
I have a feeling we're already going to be getting along pretty well.

334
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,600
If you already suggest corn soup.

335
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,180
Corn potage!

336
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,820
That stuff.

337
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,740
That's the yummy scrumptious dilly dilly dumpious stuff.

338
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,840
Right there.

339
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,760
Ectoplasm soup.

340
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,240
No.

341
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:14,460
No.

342
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,360
That's not for consumption.

343
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,560
I think.

344
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,320
I think.

345
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,240
I think.

346
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,840
But yeah.

347
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,400
Welcome to my maid cafe.

348
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,980
Can I turn on the lights actually or will it be a flash bang?

349
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,100
Will it be too bright?

350
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,560
I could do a spongebob thing.

351
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,940
Where I just flick around the lights or something.

352
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:47,960
Hahaha.

353
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,520
Turn them on.

354
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,300
Flash bang us.

355
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,640
You ready for the big bang?

356
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,240
Oh.

357
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,700
Oh.

358
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,520
Oh.

359
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,140
Oh.

360
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,100
Three.

361
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,780
Two.

362
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,800
Okay.

363
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,720
Now I can welcome you to my maid cafe.

364
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,340
Yay.

365
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,200
Welcome.

366
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,680
Welcome.

367
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,180
Welcome.

368
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,500
Welcome to my maid cafe.

369
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,460
I haunt this place.

370
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,440
Light mode my eyes.

371
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,560
Hahaha.

372
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,320
Get used to it.

373
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,580
Get used to it.

374
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:37,940
Hahaha.

375
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,480
I see some familiar names in the chat.

376
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:42,880
Hello.

377
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:44,780
Hello.

378
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,140
Hello.

379
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,420
Hello.

380
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,560
Hahaha.

381
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,120
Let there be light.

382
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,320
Hmm.

383
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,740
Hmm.

384
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,560
Hmm.

385
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,020
Hahaha.

386
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,660
Sorry.

387
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,500
I keep expanding sometimes.

388
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,160
Ahem.

389
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,420
Um.

390
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,580
What do I say now?

391
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,020
Um.

392
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,580
Uh.

393
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,820
Uh.

394
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,580
This isn't.

395
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:11,800
Okay.

396
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,260
Oh.

397
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,140
Yes.

398
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,640
Yes.

399
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
I have stuff that I want to talk about.

400
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,660
This is not like a debut.

401
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,640
Or even a re-debut.

402
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:29,420
I guess it's just me coming back and saying howdy doody to you all.

403
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,340
Um.

404
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,640
Um.

405
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:38,730
Hold on.

406
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,290
Hold on.

407
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,310
I wrote notes on my howdy doody.

408
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:42,910
Hahaha.

409
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,130
Yeah.

410
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,630
It's me saying howdy doody.

411
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,970
Oh.

412
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:46,350
Oh.

413
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:46,610
Sorry.

414
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,090
That's TikTok.

415
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,490
Ah!

416
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,390
Sorry.

417
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:49,690
Hahaha.

418
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,630
Okay.

419
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:53,950
Sorry.

420
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,310
I was watching TikToks for the nerves.

421
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:56,590
Okay.

422
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,590
Um.

423
00:19:59,130 --> 00:19:59,610
Hahaha.

424
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:00,650
Hahaha.

425
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,710
Ah.

426
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,470
Let's see.

427
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,210
Um.

428
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,070
Okay.

429
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,710
I said that I would be answering questions today, right?

430
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,630
Hahaha.

431
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,730
I said that I would be answering questions today.

432
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,510
Bye, Xiaoming!

433
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,330
Welcome back!

434
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,170
Congratulations, Mint-chan!

435
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,470
Thank you!

436
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,550
Hahaha.

437
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,710
Thank you!

438
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,670
Long time no see!

439
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,930
I missed you.

440
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,810
Ah.

441
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,770
I saw you in the open space.

442
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,950
I missed you.

443
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:42,930
Um.

444
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,970
I saw you.

445
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:45,510
Um.

446
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,390
What do you call it?

447
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:49,610
What do you call it?

448
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,710
The, the, the, the tours.

449
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,530
Akiba's...

450
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,470
Like...

451
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,330
Virtual tour.

452
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,390
But...

453
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,750
It's like in Akiba, they have like some people sometimes are on backpacks and stuff.

454
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,890
Japanese is good.

455
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,950
Thanks.

456
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,370
I just got back from Japan.

457
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:08,990
Hahaha.

458
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,010
I just got back from Japan.

459
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,390
I'm so Japanese good right now.

460
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,190
Hahaha.

461
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,290
What's special in my cafe?

462
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,810
Drinks or sweets?

463
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:24,970
Um...

464
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,210

465
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,270
Hahaha.

466
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,050
This is, this...

467
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:35,810
You can't find another ghost in your...

468
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,870
Well, there's probably actually other maid ghosts, aren't there?

469
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,850
Probably, right?

470
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,510
Hahaha.

471
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,190
I'm sold!

472
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,190
Yeah!

473
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:53,670
But yeah, I said today I would be answering some questions cause it's probably just like, what's going on?

474
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:54,950
Me too!

475
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,370
I also wonder what's going on.

476
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,250
Thank you for the donuts!

477
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,390

478
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,250
Thank you!

479
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,870
There's a lot.

480
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,870
The notifications are not stopping.

481
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,790
I appreciate you guys so, so much!

482
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:08,810
Thank you!

483
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,930
Um... Where's my notes app?

484
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,410
Notes...

485
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:14,730
Oh, here.

486
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:17,810
Okay.

487
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,590
Where's your notes?

488
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,670
Hey, you can't say that anymore, okay?

489
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,410
Oh, oh, oh.

490
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,570
No, no, no, no, no, no.

491
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,850
You can't say that anymore.

492
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,730
You literally can see my notes, okay?

493
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,470
I don't want to hear that from anybody.

494
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,790
My notes...

495
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,590
is actually so existent.

496
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:36,710
Okay?

497
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,490
Oh my gosh, I sound so scraggly cause of my sore throat.

498
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,330
I hope the karaoke doesn't sound so bad.

499
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,670
What notes?

500
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,490
Look, if I look to the side...

501
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,450
Oh!

502
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:52,890
Like that!

503
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,530
Look!

504
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,970
Did you see that?

505
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,670
Look, look, look, look, look!

506
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,890
Oh, I'm off the screen.

507
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,910
Phantom notes.

508
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:11,770
Hannah!

509
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,250
Oh my gosh, everybody's here.

510
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:15,990
Why?

511
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:18,450
Why?

512
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,010
Why?

513
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,390
Why?

514
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,430
Okay.

515
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,750
Let's see.

516
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,050
Okay.

517
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,210
I have a notes called questions for coming back stream.

518
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,770
Questions that nobody asked, but I thought maybe people would ask.

519
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:35,810
So...

520
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,390
Yeah.

521
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,230
Yeah.

522
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,230
Let's get started, I guess.

523
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,150
Okay!

524
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,710
First question that I wrote down.

525
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,770
That people might be...

526
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,070
This is so awkward.

527
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:49,870
I'm so sorry.

528
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,490
This is so awkward.

529
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,450
I'm so sorry.

530
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,150
Did ask.

531
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:57,870
Do care.

532
00:23:59,170 --> 00:23:59,910
I'm glad.

533
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:00,330
Okay.

534
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,870
Yeah, you do care.

535
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,810
Yeah, you do.

536
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,710
You do care.

537
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:07,830
Yeah.

538
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,370
Please answer.

539
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,790
Please answer.

540
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,370
The first question I wrote down that maybe people are wondering.

541
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,290
Is MI coming back permanently?

542
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,990
Is this like...

543
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,130
Is this it?

544
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:23,910
Is this...

545
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,670
Is this the finale...

546
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,090
The final return of Mint Phantom?

547
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:29,930
Is this...

548
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,110
Is this everything?

549
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,630
Is this...

550
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,650
And...

551
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,350
The simple answer is...

552
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:40,710
The simple answer is...

553
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,170
truly...

554
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,250
I don't know.

555
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,610
I don't know.

556
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:47,830
Um...

557
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,130
I don't know.

558
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,490
Uh...

559
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,590
But as long as the podcast is going, I'll be around.

560
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,910
I wish I could give you...

561
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,930
I wish I could give you...

562
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,250
a more concrete answer.

563
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,490
I wish I could tell you guys a lot of things.

564
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,330
I wish I could tell you guys...

565
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,270
everything that...

566
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,670
is going on in my brain.

567
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,990
Everything that is going on behind the scenes.

568
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,490
But unfortunately...

569
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,210
I can't.

570
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,590
So I'm really sorry.

571
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,410
I wish I could tell you everything that my brain has been swirling like...

572
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,350
ugh...

573
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,450
literal ectoplasm leaking out my ears all the time.

574
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,770
Tell me all of it.

575
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,570
But um...

576
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,230
Uh...

577
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,770
Yeah, just to be honest...

578
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,210
I'm still trying to figure out...

579
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,250
what I want to do.

580
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,230
And...

581
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,590
Um...

582
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,010
Yeah...

583
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,850
But I'm excited to be back.

584
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,630
I'm very excited to be back.

585
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,050
So...

586
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:51,910
Yes!

587
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,410
I'm happy to be here.

588
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,290
I'm really...

589
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,830
Even though I'm so anxious.

590
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,790
I'm really happy to be...

591
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,490
uh...

592
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,830
meeting you guys.

593
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,330
This is nice to meet you for a lot of people.

594
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,630
Um...

595
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,310
I know there were some people that...

596
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,270
knew me...

597
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,530
3 years ago.

598
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,350
But there's also a lot of people that don't know me...

599
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,950
now.

600
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,330
So, hi!

601
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,870
I hope you like what you see.

602
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,210
I hope you don't mind...

603
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,550
being haunted...

604
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,790
and stuff.

605
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,250
Is it okay if I haunt you?

606
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,010
Is it okay?

607
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,230
If I...

608
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,330
If I haunt you for a little bit?

609
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,590
If I steal some of your...

610
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,530
life force a little bit?

611
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:41,670
Is it okay?

612
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,450
Is it okay?

613
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,370
I consent.

614
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,050
Yes?

615
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:46,890
Please do?

616
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:47,830
Yes please?

617
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,530
I'm gonna take it all.

618
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,870
All your life force.

619
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:57,970
That's fine.

620
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,050
Like...

621
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,090
Maybe like a few years off your life.

622
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,250
And then you can be a ghost!

623
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:05,850
Just like me!

624
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,350
Isn't that so exciting?

625
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,230
Hmm...

626
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,710
Okay.

627
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,130
Yeah.

628
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,670
Okay.

629
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,570
Another question.

630
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,250
Will I be streaming regularly?

631
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,110
And I plan to be streaming...

632
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,190
about...

633
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,390
I wrote 3 to 4 times a week.

634
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,770
It might be more.

635
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,570
I think I'm...

636
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,630
I think I like streaming.

637
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,530
Back when...

638
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,010
Back a couple years ago...

639
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,030
I could only do...

640
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,310
so little because I worked at another maid cafe...

641
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,950
at the same time.

642
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:42,810
So...

643
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,170
So...

644
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,390
It was...

645
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,010
much more difficult...

646
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,290
for me.

647
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,970
But now I'm a free ghost.

648
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:53,570
So...

649
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,050
I mean I am kind of...

650
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,950
I don't know.

651
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,290
I don't know if I should be...

652
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,210
a free ghost or not.

653
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,850
I kind of talked...

654
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,730
about it on...

655
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,110
with Matara.

656
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,250
If you listen to the...

657
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,910
If you listen to the podcast...

658
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,430
I was like...

659
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:11,810
Oh my gosh.

660
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,090
Maybe...

661
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,770
Maybe I'll get like a job at a...

662
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,370
Like a part-time job at a grocery store or something.

663
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,250
You would...

664
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,710
It is surprising how expensive it is...

665
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,230
to be a ghost.

666
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,510
You wouldn't think about it.

667
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,510
But there's so many things...

668
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,810
that I have to take care of.

669
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,810
Like...

670
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,290
I just frog blinked...

671
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,030
when I said that.

672
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,690
There's truly nothing...

673
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,670
going on in my head.

674
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,510
Ghost dollars.

675
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:42,770
Ghost taxes.

676
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,250
Oh my gosh.

677
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,230
You just reminded me.

678
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,230
My tax person has been ghosting me.

679
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,810
Not the good kind of...

680
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:51,490
ghosting though.

681
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,970
This is so bad.

682
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,250
Okay.

683
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,370
Thank you for reminding me.

684
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,370
I'm gonna write that down.

685
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,290
Email...

686
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:58,950
Hold on.

687
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:01,970
Email...

688
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,150
Tax person.

689
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,010
Okay.

690
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,730
Never mind.

691
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,090
Phantom tax.

692
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,970
Who are the patriots?

693
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,030
Oh my gosh you guys.

694
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,430
Heaven?

695
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:19,810
Oh yes.

696
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,430
I probably should talk about that, right?

697
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,090
I graduated...

698
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,390
three years ago.

699
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,790
Today, actually.

700
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,990
Because I graduated on 4-4.

701
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,730
4 in Japanese.

702
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,890
And I think it's...

703
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,350
in other Asian countries too.

704
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,670
It's death.

705
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,830
It's a lucky number for me.

706
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,870
I graduated on the luckiest day.

707
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,950
And...

708
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,570
Yeah.

709
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,050
So now I'm back.

710
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,450
On the luckiest day.

711
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,550
You graduated on death death?

712
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,110
Yep.

713
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,310
Death death.

714
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,890
But I went to heaven.

715
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,490
And...

716
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,430
I don't know.

717
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:08,090
I think I'm more suited to...

718
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,210
being a ghost.

719
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,010
I think I had too many...

720
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,930
unresolved issues.

721
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:13,590
You know?

722
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,210
Like being an angel was fun.

723
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,770
And all.

724
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,910
But I just felt...

725
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,750
still this urge to...

726
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,290
to like...

727
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,010
haunt you guys.

728
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,210
And...

729
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,010
Like...

730
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:29,830
I don't know.

731
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,950
Being a ghost...

732
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,290
feels more up my alley.

733
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,130
Bustin makes you feel good.

734
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,110
No no.

735
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,690
That's not what you're supposed to do though.

736
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,350
You know?

737
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,310
You're supposed to...

738
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,950
I mean...

739
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,070
I know I covered that.

740
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,750
But like...

741
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,770
But...

742
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,410
Um...

743
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,030
Don't bust me.

744
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:53,490
Okay?

745
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,830
I ain't afraid of no sleep.

746
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,830
I ain't afraid of no bed.

747
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,350
Let's see.

748
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:06,610
What else?

749
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,550
So yeah.

750
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,270
I'll be streaming...

751
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,250
somewhat regularly.

752
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,650
It might turn into more.

753
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,790
But I don't wanna...

754
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,970
With the podcast.

755
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,690
I don't wanna do too much.

756
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:23,690
Um...

757
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,190
Oh!

758
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,190
I wrote that down.

759
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,430
Why did you come back?

760
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:28,690
I wrote...

761
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,350
Even in heaven, I felt restless.

762
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,290
Like I had some unfinished business.

763
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,730
I don't think I was ready to go.

764
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,630
So maybe I'm best at being a ghost...

765
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,390
than an angel.

766
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:39,650
Maybe.

767
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,970
I even got my wings and everything.

768
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,130
I think they were fake though.

769
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,930
I think they were cardboard.

770
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,890
Couldn't even fly properly.

771
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,270
Um...

772
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:51,710
Question.

773
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,210
Is this a re-debut?

774
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,270
Nope.

775
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,310
It's just me.

776
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,630
Coming back to streaming.

777
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,570
And if I decide to stay...

778
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,970
What was that?

779
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,150
Batara, don't look!

780
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:18,770
Look!

781
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,470
Oh my gosh.

782
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,890
You didn't said that?

783
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:21,130
No!

784
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,310
That wasn't me!

785
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,250
I think that was...

786
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,490
I think that was part of the...

787
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:27,950
The...

788
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:30,970
The donation.

789
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,630
That's so funny.

790
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,570
Hold on.

791
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,250
I'm gonna keep drinking my tea.

792
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,130
Mmm...

793
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:40,970
Mmm...

794
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,870
Will you play Delta?

795
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,930
Oh hell yeah!

796
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,530
I'm gonna play Delta!

797
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,530
Are you kidding me?

798
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,910
Yeah!

799
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:48,810
I'm gonna play Delta!

800
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,730
So excited.

801
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:53,550
Oh my gosh.

802
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,490
This is just me returning to streaming.

803
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,750
Um...

804
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,970
If I decide to stay...

805
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,070
Then I'll make it a bigger deal.

806
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,290
Like...

807
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,630
New outfit?

808
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,270
Or...

809
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,670
Graphics?

810
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:11,830
Or...

811
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,030
New shiny stuff?

812
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,660
So...

813
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,040
Yeah.

814
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,540
I already have plans.

815
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,740
If that happens.

816
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,320
Yes.

817
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,480
You will have to stick around.

818
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,880
And me too!

819
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,220
Um...

820
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,480
But for now...

821
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,120
I'm gonna be mostly sticking to this...

822
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,060
Outfit.

823
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,480
If you watched me in the past...

824
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,620
You know that I had an original outfit.

825
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,640
At the moment...

826
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,380
I don't plan on...

827
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,440
Using it.

828
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,080
I'm sorry.

829
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,340
Just like...

830
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,020
It's really outdated.

831
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,280
And kind of embarrassing to use.

832
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:06,660
I think.

833
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:08,980
So...

834
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,640
Matara was...

835
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,480
Was very generous to...

836
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,040
Even get me...

837
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,720
Uh...

838
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,780
Rigged again.

839
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,960
So I'm...

840
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,660
A little more shiny and new.

841
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,240
I actually will touch on that in the...

842
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,980
In the next podcast episode.

843
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,700
So...

844
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:28,820
Yeah.

845
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,280
This one is very cute.

846
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,320
You like it?

847
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,700
You...

848
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,500
You like it?

849
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,380
I have faces.

850
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,580
I can show you guys.

851
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,480
I can show you guys all my faces.

852
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,620
Like...

853
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,360
Or...

854
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,800
Or...

855
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,220
But yeah...

856
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,260
I'm...

857
00:34:59,260 --> 00:34:59,780
Uh...

858
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,240
It's the same face.

859
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:08,820
No, it's not.

860
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,780
Can you do a surprise one though?

861
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,340
Okay, hold on.

862
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,100
I'll do a really good one.

863
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,960
Show us the chibi mode again.

864
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,820
Okay, patience.

865
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,520
Patience.

866
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,980
Let me get through these questions first.

867
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,740
That I wrote myself.

868
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,280
And no one wrote but me.

869
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,600
Um...

870
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:31,960
Um...

871
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,620
Uh...

872
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:33,880
Oh!

873
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,160
This one we talked about on Matara's stream.

874
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,520
But I will say it here as well.

875
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,140
Does the podcast mean that you are joining Bishoujo?

876
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,560
And no!

877
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,460
Does not mean that I am joining Bishoujo.

878
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,840
I'm just collaborating.

879
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,400
Collaborating?

880
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,100
Collaborating with Matara.

881
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,120
So I can haunt her and suck her life force.

882
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,600
And cause her discomfort in her daily life.

883
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,460
And cause her discomfort in her daily life.

884
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:58,820
So...

885
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,000
Yes.

886
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:04,960
That's it.

887
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,380
That's it.

888
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,920
That's it.

889
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,400
That's it.

890
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,560
That's it.

891
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,180
But uh...

892
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,200
Bishoujo has been helping with um...

893
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,220
With some of the stuff like the merchandise.

894
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,360
With some of the stuff like the merchandise.

895
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:26,800
Um...

896
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,060
Hashtag save Mata.

897
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,060
No!

898
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:32,920
Me!

899
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,100
I was summoned against my will!

900
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,260
What are you talking about?

901
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,680
What are you talking about?

902
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,920
I was summoned against my will!

903
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,100
Is this model all new?

904
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,640
No, just the rigging.

905
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:49,880
Um...

906
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,660
I got this model just before...

907
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,020
Or this outfit...

908
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,820
This new look.

909
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,400
Just before I...

910
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,820
Uh...

911
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,040
What's the word?

912
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,780
Left for heaven.

913
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,380
Yeah, yeah.

914
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,500
So...

915
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,220
Um...

916
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,140
But yeah...

917
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,660
Everything is so confusing.

918
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,780
People always say...

919
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,280
That I'm doing this and doing that.

920
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,720
I don't even know...

921
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,080
What I'm having for breakfast tomorrow.

922
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:19,900
So...

923
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,740
Let's just take it.

924
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,980
Let's just take things...

925
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,340
One step at a time.

926
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:24,700
Okay?

927
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,460
Um...

928
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,040
Another question...

929
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,680
That I wrote down.

930
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,120
Why didn't you come back sooner?

931
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,200
Um... I don't know.

932
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,100
Uh...

933
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,580
I don't know.

934
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,740
I probably...

935
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,600
I guess I could have come back anytime.

936
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,280
Maybe.

937
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:43,920
But I...

938
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,740
Honestly, I wanted to take some time...

939
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,260
To myself...

940
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,780
And shrugging emoji.

941
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,700
Basically.

942
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,520
I wanted to take some time...

943
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,840
To myself...

944
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,960
Be a little productive.

945
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,300
I just came back from studying in Japan.

946
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,060
So...

947
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,120
I just kind of wanted to take some time...

948
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,600
Away from my usual area.

949
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,500
And uh...

950
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,440
Clear my head and figure out what I want to do going forward.

951
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,680
And did I do that?

952
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,460
No!

953
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,040
I'm even more confused.

954
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,900
I have no idea.

955
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,640
What was the next question I wrote?

956
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,740
Did you clear your head and figure out what you wanted to do going forward?

957
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,720
No!

958
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,360
Next question!

959
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,980
Will you un-private your old VODs?

960
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,040
Um...

961
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
This one is like a tricky one for me, right?

962
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,320
Because...

963
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,480
I'm still deciding.

964
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,540
Uh...

965
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,080
A lot has changed from back then.

966
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,560
And...

967
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,300
I cringe every time I see an old clip.

968
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,160
I cringe at my old mic quality.

969
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,560
I...

970
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,940
I cringe...

971
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,700
At a lot of things.

972
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,780
A lot has changed.

973
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,560
I feel... I'm worried that maybe if I...

974
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,060
Uh...

975
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,320
If people watch...

976
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,940
The old VODs, they'll be like...

977
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,460
Oh, she's so different...

978
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,420
Than how she was 3 years ago.

979
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,680
Now, you know?

980
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,720
So...

981
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,360
I don't know.

982
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,980
I don't know.

983
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:19,960
So...

984
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,740
Um...

985
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:23,820
Uh...

986
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,580
I know there's like...

987
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,220
Old... old... old...

988
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,440
You boomers out there!

989
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,140
I'm maybe... I'm not the boomer.

990
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,500
You guys are the boomers.

991
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:33,880
Get it?

992
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,280
Boomer?

993
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,510
People that watched me before...

994
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,750
And uh...

995
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,510
You know...

996
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,550
Might wanna like bring up old jokes...

997
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,330
And things that we did.

998
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,230
Things that we...

999
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,090
You know...

1000
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:01,930
Talked about and everything.

1001
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,110
But I kinda wanna like just...

1002
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,090
I don't know.

1003
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:06,890
Make this...

1004
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,530
A place where...

1005
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,050
Even newcomers can...

1006
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,510
Can come in and be like...

1007
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,070
You know...

1008
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,550
Can...

1009
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,730
Enjoy right away.

1010
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,490
You know, I don't want it to be like...

1011
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,290
Oh, I don't get this joke.

1012
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,130
What is she talking about?

1013
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,190
Things like that.

1014
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,810
I want it to be...

1015
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,710
Welcoming for everybody.

1016
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,250
Yeah, new chapter.

1017
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,190
Maybe.

1018
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,550
Does that mean no Metal Gear Solid jokes?

1019
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,370
What are you talking about?

1020
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,310
I can't...I can't stop talking...

1021
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:37,990
About Metal Gear.

1022
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,030
Heaven had Metal Gear, you guys.

1023
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,070
It's probably the best thing...

1024
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,010
Not the best.

1025
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:06,840
Well anyway, it had Metal Gear, and I'm sorry that I must tell you that I've come back brain-rotted.

1026
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,600
Welcome back to the living?

1027
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,860
Hey, I'm not living though.

1028
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,560
I'm definitely deceased.

1029
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,940
We can tell.

1030
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,900
I'm so sorry.

1031
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,760
I'm so sorry.

1032
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,020
Outer heaven.

1033
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,720
That's literally me right now.

1034
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,720
I think I am...

1035
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:44,840
Oh my gosh.

1036
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,800
The phantom...

1037
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,560
The phantom pain!

1038
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,180
Have I been...

1039
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,160
Have I been snake this whole time?

1040
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,000
Oh my gosh.

1041
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,560
It all makes sense right now.

1042
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,620
It was predestined.

1043
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,320
Truly.

1044
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,620
The phantom pain.

1045
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,700
Oh my gosh.

1046
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,880
Let's see what else do I have.

1047
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,000
Oh!

1048
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,000
Question.

1049
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,800
If you decide to stay around longer, what can we expect?

1050
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,020
Okay, this is kind of funny.

1051
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,480
I wrote a lot!

1052
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,080
More consistent schedule, comma, and then nothing else.

1053
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,400
Oh boy, I'm selling it, aren't I?

1054
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,260
You can expect so much from me.

1055
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,680
You can expect...

1056
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,760
...

1057
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,160
you can expect...

1058
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,440
...

1059
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,120
...

1060
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,600
...

1061
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,600
...

1062
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:56,800
...

1063
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,220
That's all I ever wanted, really?

1064
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,580
Yep!

1065
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,440
So...

1066
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,940
I'll take your entire stock.

1067
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,220
Sign me up.

1068
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,600
Sold!

1069
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,480
Yes.

1070
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:24,900
Sold.

1071
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,560
What a deal.

1072
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,300
Expect redacted.

1073
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:29,680
Something.

1074
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,200
It's something big.

1075
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,040
I can't... I'm keeping you guys on your toes.

1076
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,680
I can't let you in on all my secrets.

1077
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,480
So...

1078
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,930
Why is Snake Fortnite emoting in my screen?

1079
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,790
Hold on.

1080
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:58,510
I gotta cough.

1081
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,430
I coughed.

1082
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,370
A thousand.

1083
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:16,250
What?

1084
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,610
Thank you.

1085
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,530
How are my studies going?

1086
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:39,330
Oh, I'm done.

1087
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,310
It was just a short program.

1088
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,330
It was just a short study.

1089
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:44,770
It wasn't...

1090
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:56,650
Well, originally I wanted it to be six months, but the school could only do two, and so now I'm back.

1091
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:57,310
I'm back home.

1092
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:00,450
Yeah.

1093
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:02,410
So...

1094
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:03,530
But it was good.

1095
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:04,590
I learned a lot.

1096
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,330
Yeah, I learned a lot.

1097
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:07,450
Hahaha.

1098
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:09,470
Yeah.

1099
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:11,630
What did you study?

1100
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:12,590
I studied Nihongo.

1101
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:19,470
I studied Nihongo so I could talk to my idol Oshis better.

1102
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:24,290
But...

1103
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,670
A lot of it was like...

1104
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,070
A lot of it was like keigo.

1105
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:33,930
It's just...

1106
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,850
Ikki.

1107
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:38,250
Ikki Nihongo.

1108
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,630
I mean, Ikki keigo.

1109
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:43,250
Yeah, yeah.

1110
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,030
Too based?

1111
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:46,730
What do you mean?

1112
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,650
What do you mean?

1113
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:51,750
Oh, sorry.

1114
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,630

1115
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,190

00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:05,950

1118
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:07,410

00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,690
This feels like a real... Hold on.

1122
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:14,010
Oh!

1123
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:17,030
Do I have to do the Vtuber thing where I show my body?

1124
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,690
Do you guys want to see my body?

1157
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,710
My thighs are dripping!

1158
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,430
The chocolate is actually dripping!

1159
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,710
The chocolate is actually dripping!

1160
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:29,110
It's...

1161
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:29,710
It's...

1162
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,930
My ectoplasm a little bit.

1163
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:39,010
My...

1164
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,430
Even the chocolate is possessed.

1165
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,670
Even the chocolate is possessed.

1166
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:44,390
Isn't that crazy?

1167
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:45,550
Yummy.

1168
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:48,370
Except it's not for licking.

1169
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,390
It's a decoration.

1170
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:52,030
It's actually poisoned.

1171
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:54,510
If you...

1172
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:56,310
If you...

1173
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,870
Lick it, you will die.

1174
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:04,770
Um... Okay.

1175
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:05,630
I have.

1176
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,050
This is how I'm feeling.

1177
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,990
This whole time with so many people.

1178
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:16,710
So many people.

1179
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,430
Actually, I don't even know what the number is.

1180
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,790
I don't even... I'm afraid to look.

1181
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:22,010
I'm afraid to look.

1182
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,450
I don't even know how...

1183
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,690
In my brain, there's only two of you guys.

1184
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:30,990
There's... Okay.

1185
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:32,770
At least two.

1186
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:34,350
Exactly.

1187
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:36,930
Don't say it!

1188
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:37,670
Don't say it!

1189
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:38,430
Don't say it!

1190
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,310
Don't say it!

1191
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,570
Don't say the number!

1192
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,230
We're just typing really fast.

1193
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:49,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1194
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:50,850
Don't say it!

1195
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:51,470
Don't say it!

1196
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:51,970
Don't say it!

1197
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,520
I can... I can blush even more.

1198
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,220
I can blush a little bit.

1199
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,620
I can blush a lot a bit.

1200
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,720
This is when... This is...

1201
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,940
This is when... This is when...

1202
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,900
Uh... This is when...

1203
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,580
This... This is... This is when...

1204
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,380
This is when I'm still flustered...

1205
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,880
Flustered, flustered, flustered.

1206
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,840
I can't speak.

1207
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,280
Hahaha.

1208
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,540
This is when...

1209
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:29,820
Hahaha.

1210
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,280
When you see Raiden naked, so true.

1211
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,220
Oh my gosh, so true.

1212
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,580
Hey, you guys didn't hear...

1213
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,660
You didn't hear anything!

1214
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:56,940
Okay!

1215
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,760
You heard nothing!

1216
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,480
Can I have a bite of my pizza?

1217
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,820
Sorry, I forgot to eat.

1218
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,540
I got...

1219
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,100
My stomach before this was like...

1220
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,420
Like really growling at me.

1221
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:37,880
Um...

1222
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,680
I think we're comfortable enough now that...

1223
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,460
I could eat on stream.

1224
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,240
What the hell is that?

1225
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,180
Who was that?

1226
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,200
Who was...

1227
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,640
Who was that?

1228
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,460
Oh, you can hear me chewing on that.

1229
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:05,920
I'm gonna mute.

1230
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,300
It was the pizza delivery man.

1231
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,480
Oh, it was Ryan Gosling.

1232
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,920
I uh...

1233
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,820
When I...

1234
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,840
When I'm on the plane...

1235
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,080
I...

1236
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,100
Usually watch...

1237
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,080
I usually watch one of...

1238
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,840
Or actually...

1239
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,380
I usually watch two movies for sure.

1240
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,480
Or three.

1241
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,340
Actually three movies for sure.

1242
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,740
The first one...

1243
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,480
Is Indiana Jones.

1244
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,960
Some Indiana Jones movie.

1245
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,320
This last time I watched The Temple of Doom.

1246
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,880
And then...

1247
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,920
I always watch Top Gun.

1248
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,240
Most...

1249
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,900
Usually I watch Top Gun Maverick.

1250
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,720
I think Top Gun Maverick is...

1251
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,020
My favorite movie of all time by this point.

1252
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,340
I have watched Top Gun Maverick...

1253
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,640
So many times.

1254
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,140
I just...

1255
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,620
I can't...

1256
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,380
I...

1257
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,500
I don't know how many times I have watched it at this point.

1258
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,660
I watch it going...

1259
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:07,080
Going...

1260
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,060
To Japan and going back...

1261
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,320
Every time that I've gone for like the past...

1262
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,540
Year and a half.

1263
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,640
I think...

1264
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,500
It's so...

1265
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,360
Good!

1266
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,120
Oh my gosh.

1267
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,940
I love the original Top Gun too.

1268
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,780
But Top Gun Maverick is just...

1269
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,280
Oh my god.

1270
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,020
My favorite...

1271
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,920
My favorite scene is when...

1272
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,260
Maverick...

1273
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,940
Tom Cruise...

1274
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,680
That's...

1275
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,280
That's him, right?

1276
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,660
It's Tom Cruise, right?

1277
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:33,880
Yeah.

1278
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,880
When he is showing...

1279
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,920
When he's showing the class...

1280
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,800
When they have...

1281
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,320
When he is like...

1282
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,700
Showing them that the mission is possible.

1283
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:43,540
Oh my gosh.

1284
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:43,800
Wait.

1285
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,820
He's in Mission Impossible.

1286
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,060
No.

1287
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,200
I didn't mean...

1288
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,320
What?

1289
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:58,840
Oops.

1290
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,260
It's Top Gunning time.

1291
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,620
When he is showing...

1292
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:05,860
What?

1293
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,000
When he does...

1294
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,820
When he is like...

1295
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:08,760
When they are just like...

1296
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,080
Oh my gosh.

1297
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:09,680
We can't...

1298
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,840
We can't complete the mission in the time limit.

1299
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,580
And with the...

1300
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,600
Enough accuracy.

1301
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,280
Oh my gosh.

1302
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,040
Thanks for the raid.

1303
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,480
Thank you.

1304
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,180
But...

1305
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,200
I love that scene.

1306
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,000
And I love...

1307
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,220
What was it?

1308
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,240
Oh, yeah.

1309
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,160
That's the scene I love.

1310
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:35,860
But...

1311
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,180
It's...

1312
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,360
It gets me so hype.

1313
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:39,740
Sorry.

1314
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,460
Are we talking about the same movie?

1315
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,400
Yes.

1316
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,320
Yes.

1317
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,080
We're talking about Top Gun Maverick.

1318
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,620
That's Ryan Reynolds.

1319
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,120
No, it's not.

1320
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:52,420
Oh.

1321
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:52,780
That's...

1322
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,700
That's what I was getting at though.

1323
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,840
The third movie I usually watch is La La Land.

1324
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,780
And I think before then...

1325
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,980
Before La La Land...

1326
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,920
I wasn't...

1327
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,560
I wasn't so into Ryan Reynolds.

1328
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,740
I know that he was like a meme for a long time.

1329
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:05,860
But...

1330
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,960
But now...

1331
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,820
I...

1332
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,560
I think I...

1333
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,480
I think I get it.

1334
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,520
Because of La La Land.

1335
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,340
Oh, wait.

1336
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:14,580
Sorry.

1337
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,460
That's Ryan Gosling.

1338
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,100
Sorry.

1339
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,120
Sorry.

1340
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,320
Ryan Reynolds is dead fully.

1341
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,040
I...

1342
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:34,920
I...

1343
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:35,860
I...

1344
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,060
I know.

1345
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,160
My throat.

1346
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,040
I can't even laugh properly.

1347
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:45,400
Sorry.

1348
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,600
I sound so raspy.

1349
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:47,680
I think.

1350
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:54,840
Sorry.

1351
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,520
I get them...

1352
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,300
I tend to get them confused.

1353
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,880
Along with other Hollywood actors.

1354
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:02,860
Hold on.

1355
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,900
I'm going to mute so I can eat.

1356
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:04,760
Okay.

1357
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:05,860
Okay.

1358
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,020
Oh my gosh.

1359
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,080
Thank you for the acca donut.

1360
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,780
Thank you.

1361
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,180
You guys are way too generous.

1362
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,240
Holy cow.

1363
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:22,920
You know.

1364
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,000
What do you think of making Old Bob's members only?

1365
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,120
Maybe.

1366
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:28,880
That's an idea.

1367
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,760
That is an idea that I can think of.

1368
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,620
Thanks for the suggestion.

1369
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:34,820
Oh my gosh.

1370
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,240
Even before streams, someone was already backsating me in the donuts.

1371
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,760
They were like...

1372
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,880
And I was like, what?

1373
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,320
Why am I already being vaccinated?

1374
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,300
There's a discord?

1375
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,720
There apparently is a discord.

1376
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,460
If anybody wants to join it, I suppose.

1377
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,440
Where was I?

1378
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,360
Oh, I can be...

1379
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,920
I can be sad.

1380
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,020
I can be more sad!

1381
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,380
Oh god!

1382
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,380
My eyes are so wobbly.

1383
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:34,330
I'm so sad.

1384
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:37,890
I'm so sad right now.

1385
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,330
That...

1386
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,830
That you...

1387
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:45,770
That you...

1388
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:48,050
Um...

1389
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:50,130
Don't want me to join the discord.

1390
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:54,190
Why can't I join the discord?

1391
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:57,130
Why can't I join?

1392
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:59,270
Why don't you guys want me around?

1393
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,010
Not saying howdy.

1394
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:11,690
You're not invited.

1395
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:12,030
You're not invited.

1396
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:14,510
You're not invited.

1397
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,590
Oh, there was another gif?

1398
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:18,470
Oh no, I missed it.

1399
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,250
I missed it!

1400
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:23,530
Uh, let's see.

1401
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:23,890
What else?

1402
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:24,690
Oh, I can be...

1403
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:26,110
You guys have seen this one before.

1404
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:27,750
I've seen several.

1405
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:34,690
Several people using this as a reaction.

1406
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:40,770
Oh...

1407
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:42,230
Wah...

1408
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:43,830
Wah...

1409
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:47,590
Shock... I'm so shocked.

1410
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:48,630
Um...

1411
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:49,690
Um...

1412
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:52,630
This is me joining the discord.

1413
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,190
And seeing everything that you guys are saying.

1414
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:02,010
Yeah.

1415
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:06,470
And then...

1416
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:07,410
This is me!

1417
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:09,170
Join... This is me!

1418
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:10,570
What the hell?

1419
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:11,170
Oh my god.

1420
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,570
I was like, why are there naked men?

1421
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,770
Is this God's...

1422
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:24,290
Thank you, see?

1423
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:27,850
Oh my gosh.

1424
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:30,590
This is me...

1425
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,290
Five minutes after joining the discord.

1426
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,680
Maybe I didn't...

1427
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,660
Need to join the discord.

1428
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:50,660
Ah...

1429
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,060
Ah...

1430
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,520
Yeah, yeah.

1431
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,080
Eh...

1432
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,240
Oh gosh.

1433
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,300
There's gonna be...

1434
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,180
Wait, I don't even know how many...

1435
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,600
Donations there are.

1436
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,040
I'm scared.

1437
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,300
Uh oh.

1438
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,180
I declare...

1439
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,420
Bankruptcy.

1440
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,220
I...

1441
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,060
I prematurely declare...

1442
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:32,820
Bankruptcy.

1443
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:33,300
No, I'm just kidding.

1444
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,180
Uh... Let's see.

1445
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:36,840
Oh, this one.

1446
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:37,940
Mm-hmm.

1447
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,260
This is...

1448
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:40,480
This is when any...

1449
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,180
When Metal Gear discussion...

1450
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,320
Metal Gear, Metal Gear...

1451
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,340
Metal Gear discussion, let's go!

1452
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,960
But also...

1453
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,860
When I think about the discord.

1454
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,160
You better not be saying...

1455
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,240
Crazy things in there.

1456
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,820
The next one, I'm never gonna use.

1457
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:07,760
So...

1458
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,980
This is your one time to see it.

1459
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:10,320
Okay?

1460
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,440
I'm gonna get in real close for you.

1461
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,620
This is your one time to see...

1462
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,600
This face...

1463
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,080
What is that?

1464
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,540
What is...

1465
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,120
What was that?

1466
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,400
What was that?

1467
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,960
Hold on, I'm gonna move the notice somewhere else.

1468
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,200
I'm gonna move you guys down here.

1469
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,480
I'm never gonna use this one.

1470
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:40,540
So...

1471
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:41,920
Just today.

1472
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:43,720
Bye.

1473
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,060
I have no...

1474
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,000
I don't even know...

1475
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,040
What I would use this one for.

1476
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,600
Okay.

1477
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,220
This might be a mistake, showing you guys, at all.

1478
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,580
This might be a mistake, showing you guys, at all.

1479
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:01,160
This might be a mistake.

1480
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:21,950
No!

1481
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,800
Oh my gosh!

1482
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,020
Okay, but the worst part is...

1483
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,560
Why?

1484
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,240
Why is there steam coming out of my mouth?

1485
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:50,660
Why?

1486
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,660
Hot pot.

1487
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,630
This is me seeing corn soup.

1488
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:02,950
I want some more!

1489
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:06,870
It's cold outside.

1490
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:08,030
True, true, true, true.

1491
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:09,670
True, true, true.

1492
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,210
You don't want to see if I combine it.

1493
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:20,010
I have the coconut to eat.

1494
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,850
Dream works, anybody?

1495
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,100
No, no, no!

1496
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,040
No, no, go away!

1497
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,100
Okay, we're fine.

1498
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,780
We're normal, we're normal, we're normal.

1499
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,500
Get outta here!

1500
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,900
Oh my god!

1501
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,140
These gifts are so cursed.

1502
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,000
I completely forgot that was a theme.

1503
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:59,680
I turned it off before, so I completely forgot it was a thing for Streamlabs to be able to do that.

1504
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,500
No, we are not.

1505
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,460
Mint looking at Snake.

1506
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:05,400
Snake!

1507
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,620
No, this is me looking at Plissken.

1508
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:12,960
Plissken.

1509
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,140
He's so cool.

1510
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,160
Maybe I do have a reason to use him.

1511
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,640
I do have Fortnite, because I got Snake.

1512
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,060
But I have to change my name on it.

1513
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,120
My name right now is something ridiculous.

1514
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:42,960
And also...

1515
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,940
Because it got on my tongue.

1516
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,580
I'm not going to open my mouth all the way though.

1517
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,800
I'm not going to give you weirdos what you want.

1518
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,020
But I can give you...

1519
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,720
Don't combine that with the heart eyes.

1520
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,380
I'm not going to give you guys what you want.

1521
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,320
I know better.

1522
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,780
I know better.

1523
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,880
Please, it's my birthday.

1524
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:26,620
It's not.

1525
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:29,540
So cute.

1526
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:30,740
Oh.

1527
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,280
Wait, who was that?

1528
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:34,460
Usami!

1529
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:35,840
Oh my gosh!

1530
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,820
Oh my gosh, it's been so long.

1531
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:38,640
Hello!

1532
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:43,100
Hello!

1533
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,840
Oh my gosh.

1534
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,540
So many people have come back.

1535
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,200
Hello, hello.

1536
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,620
I think that was all I had.

1537
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,920
Oh, I can...

1538
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,440
Top Gun!

1539
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,680
Yeah, baby.

1540
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,340
Oh my god, wait.

1541
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,080
Jakedo, you sent the other one before too.

1542
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,180
The other gif.

1543
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,060
Love it when Tom Cruise...

1544
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:05,780
Oh, I missed it.

1545
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:06,500
Wait.

1546
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:11,540
Oh, shows that the mission is possible.

1547
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,000
Stop.

1548
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,040
I can also be very smug.

1549
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,140
Oh, I also...

1550
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,160
I saw...

1551
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:23,900
I showed this one earlier.

1552
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:27,880
Oh, head empty.

1553
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,160
No thoughts.

1554
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,060
Nothing.

1555
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,000
Nothing going on behind my brain.

1556
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:37,360
And also...

1557
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,000
Hmm.

1558
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,260
I like combining...

1559
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:40,800
I like this one.

1560
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:41,760
Hmm.

1561
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:45,300
Hmm.

1562
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:45,800
Hmm.

1563
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,460
Hmm.

1564
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,140
Hmm.

1565
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,220
Hmm.

1566
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:48,380
Hmm.

1567
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:48,740
Hmm.

1568
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:49,660
Hmm.

1569
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,100
Hmm.

1570
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:52,500
Hmm.

1571
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,520
Hmm.

1572
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,340
Hmm.

1573
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:54,580
Hmm.

1574
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:54,820
Hmm.

1575
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:55,480
Hmm.

1576
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,200
Yeah.

1577
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:58,060
Hmm.

1578
01:05:59,060 --> 01:05:59,540
Hmm.

1579
01:05:59,540 --> 01:05:59,980
Hmm.

1580
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:01,420
Yeah.

1581
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,240
Hmm...

1582
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,020
Come on.

1583
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:03,300
Hmm.

1584
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:03,480
Conada face.

1585
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:04,740
For real though, actually.

1586
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,800
I think that's everything now.

1587
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,080
Oh, can I...

1588
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:09,640
I can also...

1589
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:09,840
Oh!

1590
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,760
That's not everything!

1591
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:11,340
Oh my gosh.

1592
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,700
Tara hooked me up.

1593
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,560
I can also...

1594
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:14,760
Hmm.

1595
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:15,300
Hmmm.

1596
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:15,720
Hmm.

1597
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:15,900
Hmm.

1598
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:41,880
That's the best one?

1599
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:42,500
You think so?

1600
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:45,160
The GIFs.

1601
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:45,660
What is it?

1602
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:46,960
It was Brian Reynolds again.

1603
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:54,360
Oh, I can also... I can cross my eyes.

1604
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:55,740
Whoa!

1605
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,500
I feel like a Dreamworks.

1606
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:20,590
Oh my gosh.

1607
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:22,410
I think that's everything.

1608
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:24,990
Now, I think.

1609
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:25,810
Maybe.

1610
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:28,050
Oh, there's also... well, this is like...

1611
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:32,110
I can... I can start sweating.

1612
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:35,870
When I'm just feeling a little bit sweaty.

1613
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,150
I'm sweaty!

1614
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:40,990
Sweaty gaming.

1615
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:47,070
Sniffa?

1616
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:47,370
Hey!

1617
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:49,630
That's my ectoplasm.

1618
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,730
Stop it.

1619
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:52,910
How much for a mint sweat bottle?

1620
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,130
You don't want it.

1621
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:57,170
You don't want it.

1622
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:58,210
Microwave scene.

1623
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:03,570
Okay.

1624
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:04,250
Okay.

1625
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:05,370
Are we ready to sing?

1626
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:11,010
I feel a little less nervous, but...

1627
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,950
How are we feeling?

1628
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:16,270
How are we...

1629
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:17,810
Do you guys...

1630
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:20,110
I know I... I know I look a little different.

1631
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:22,210
I really... I did talk about this in the podcast.

1632
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:24,670
I really did love Yua's rigging.

1633
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,470
Yua did such an amazing job.

1634
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:29,090
And I love Yua so much.

1635
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:30,210
She saved me.

1636
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:31,030
And...

1637
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:31,690
Snake!

1638
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:33,750
What does it say?

1639
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:34,630
I've heard it.

1640
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:35,450
Hahaha.

1641
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:38,670
Hahaha.

1642
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:40,630
Hahaha.

1643
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:41,390
Hahaha.

1644
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:41,490
Hahaha.

1645
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:41,710
Hahaha.

1646
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:42,390
Hahaha.

1647
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:42,530
Hahaha.

1648
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:46,890
Oh, the TV model.

1649
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:47,390
That's right.

1650
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:48,010
That's right.

1651
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:52,150
It's a little disturbing to watch me switch back and forth.

1652
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:54,290
So, it's kind of like body of where it feels.

1653
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:55,630
Um...

1654
01:08:57,930 --> 01:08:58,770
But, uh...

1655
01:08:58,770 --> 01:08:59,530
What was I gonna say?

1656
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:01,470
Oh my god, Kermit!

1657
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:05,430
Minty fresh!

1658
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:09,690
Minty fresh!

1659
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:12,430
Minty fresh!

1660
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:14,450
I don't even remember what I was saying.

1661
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:17,970
I don't even remember what I was saying.

1662
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:19,710
Oh, I was gonna say...

1663
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:19,970
Oh, yes.

1664
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:22,270
I was saying I loved Yua's rigging so much.

1665
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:25,450
Yua as my papa was the best ever.

1666
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:27,070
But, uh...

1667
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:28,710
And I mentioned this...

1668
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,330
Sorry, I know I keep saying that.

1669
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:31,270
I've said it in the podcast.

1670
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:33,030
But I...

1671
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,150
Um...

1672
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:35,470
But the...

1673
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:36,430
It was actually incomplete.

1674
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,290
Because we had to get it done so quickly.

1675
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:41,410
So...

1676
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:43,170
Um...

1677
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:44,270
It...

1678
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:44,950
It was...

1679
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:46,410
It's a little incomplete because...

1680
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:47,190
Or...

1681
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:49,170
It was incomplete because of that.

1682
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:51,630
So, with this I was able to...

1683
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:55,110
Get a bunch of stuff that I had originally wanted.

1684
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:56,970
Here.

1685
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:57,850
Now.

1686
01:09:58,330 --> 01:09:58,890
Yeah.

1687
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:59,370
Gosh!

1688
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:02,150
This like enhances my chest.

1689
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:03,950
I'm a chibi!

1690
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:05,890
And I do steppies.

1691
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:07,170
Steppy tap.

1692
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,310
Steppy tap tap.

1693
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:09,490
Tippy tap.

1694
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:10,810
Um...

1695
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:11,310
Get on.

1696
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:13,470
You razzle dazzle.

1697
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:15,890
Razzle.

1698
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:16,750
Dazzle-umn.

1699
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:18,390
Um!

1700
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:19,730
How can they see you?

1701
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:22,590
With sequins in their eyes?

1702
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:25,230
Yup.

1703
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,390
I look like a...

1704
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:30,470
I look like a baby.

1705
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:31,670
I'm a baby.

1706
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:36,090
You got games on your phone?

1707
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:38,810
Do kids still play Roblox?

1708
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:39,950
What do...

1709
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:43,210
Ew, what are like... what is gen alpha play now?

1710
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:48,690
If not... Roblox and uh...

1711
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:49,470
They do?

1712
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:50,430
Yes?

1713
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,130
I have no idea.

1714
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:55,670
Nobody puts baby in the corner.

1715
01:10:56,210 --> 01:11:00,870
You know, I only know that line from... from... uh...

1716
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:03,870
How do I say?

1717
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:06,190
Okay.

1718
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:08,870
I guess I'll be honest with you guys.

1719
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:10,970
You know, in the past...

1720
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:14,030
I wasn't entirely honest with you guys.

1721
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:16,290
When I said...

1722
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,930
I was going to go work at a maid cafe...

1723
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:20,330
I lied.

1724
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:22,830
In fact, I only haunt...

1725
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:24,310
this one maid cafe.

1726
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:28,470
I...

1727
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:29,950
was working...

1728
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:31,530
an office job.

1729
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:33,750
I was haunting an office.

1730
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,370
I'm sorry to have lied to you.

1731
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:41,010
You probably thought I was some super maid.

1732
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:42,390
Who...

1733
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:45,090
was going around to every maid cafe ever.

1734
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:47,730
And being so productive and awesome.

1735
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:49,210
And like I was the best maid ever.

1736
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:52,990
I'm a big phony.

1737
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,690
I'm a big phony.

1738
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:00,590
But that's how I know that...

1739
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:01,170
Who was that?

1740
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:06,830
I'm getting a bunch of strangers coming in.

1741
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:11,810
You're so mean new to me.

1742
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:12,510
So you pay me the bills.

1743
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,010
You like to call me the phony.

1744
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:15,130
Waiter is like a damn fiddle.

1745
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:17,890
But yeah...

1746
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:21,490
I'm so sorry to have...

1747
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,730
To have lied to you like that.

1748
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:25,410
Oh my gosh.

1749
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:26,510
It's weird seeing my...

1750
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:39,610
There was a lady at one of my jobs who would always say, Nobody puts baby in the corner.

1751
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,570
I don't know what it's from.

1752
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:44,150
It's from a movie, right?

1753
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:47,210
It's from a movie, right?

1754
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:49,530
But she would say it all the time.

1755
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:54,030
And she would say that and she would say, Dingo ate your baby!

1756
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:56,930
Dirty dancing!

1757
01:12:57,890 --> 01:12:59,090
I've never seen it.

1758
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,330
I'm Say-So.

1759
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:02,190
I don't dirty dance.

1760
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,370
I'm Dirty Dan.

1761
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:16,990
Singing time.

1762
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:19,990
Give me a second to set up.

1763
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:26,930
I haven't used this in a long time.

1764
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:33,050
Okay.

1765
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:34,530
I think we're good.

1766
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:35,570
Hold on.

1767
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:39,830
Okay.

1768
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,410
I think we're good.

1769
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:43,710
Oh!

1770
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:44,750
We're not good!

1771
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:46,450
Oh my gosh!

1772
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:46,890
Anya!

1773
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:52,470
Hold on.

1774
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:54,470
Before singing.

1775
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:55,530
I'm an idiot.

1776
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:58,270
I should have done this at the beginning of the stream.

1777
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:09,390
This is a small introduction.

1778
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:11,790
For people that don't know who I am.

1779
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:17,190
A small introduction.

1780
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:18,510
Welcome back.

1781
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:19,990
Master.

1782
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:21,490
Lady.

1783
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:24,270
Um...

1784
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:29,010
I made this when I actually debuted this model.

1785
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,450
A long time ago.

1786
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:33,110
Um...

1787
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,270
When I had my 2.0 debut.

1788
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:36,890
Um...

1789
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:38,150
And I didn't change anything.

1790
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:39,090
Because...

1791
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:41,130
I don't have Photoshop anymore.

1792
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:42,690
I was like...

1793
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:42,930
Oh...

1794
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:44,930
I don't even know what to change.

1795
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:46,290
Everything was pretty much the same.

1796
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:46,890
So...

1797
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:47,850
Hmm...

1798
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:49,270
This is me.

1799
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:51,650
I'm Forever 19.

1800
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:56,090
And my birthday is also my death day.

1801
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:58,590
Which is October 1st.

1802
01:14:59,130 --> 01:14:59,690
Um...

1803
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:01,290
Maybe we'll celebrate it.

1804
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:01,970
This year.

1805
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:05,450
Maybe we'll celebrate it.

1806
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:06,530
This year, right?

1807
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:07,870
Um...

1808
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,350
I'm 149 centimeters.

1809
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:12,430
And usually you don't ask a lady her weight.

1810
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:12,930
But...

1811
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:13,910
Since I'm a ghost.

1812
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:15,050
I'm zero kilograms.

1813
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:15,650
So...

1814
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:16,170
It doesn't matter.

1815
01:15:17,150 --> 01:15:17,710
Um...

1816
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:18,990
My special trait...

1817
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:20,210
Is my toad impression.

1818
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:23,610
I'm pretty good at impressions.

1819
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:24,350
Actually.

1820
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:25,470
I'd say.

1821
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:29,510
Skinny legend.

1822
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,910
What...

1823
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:43,280
What would toads say in a situation like this?

1824
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,120
Skinny legend!

1825
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:53,460
Ah!

1826
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:54,080
Ah!

1827
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,320
Any frog pretends?

1828
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:57,440
Oh!

1829
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:00,560
I can kind of do a Kermit impression.

1830
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:02,380
Right?

1831
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,320
Ah!

1832
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:06,240
Hold on...

1833
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,240
I have to really channel it...

1834
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,040
Through my throat.

1835
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,320
HEY!

1836
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,380
What does the Kermit say?

1837
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,700
Welcome to the Muppets.

1838
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,420
I'm going to Muppet all over the place.

1839
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,500
I can't do it.

1840
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:40,400
I can't do it.

1841
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:45,720
I can't do it.

1842
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:46,940
He says hello Canada.

1843
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:47,620
He dies?

1844
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,060
Maybe it's like a special episode that I've never seen.

1845
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,820
I don't know what he would say.

1846
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:54,940
Hello Canada.

1847
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,880
Like that?

1848
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,060
Is that how he would say it?

1849
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,260
Yeah.

1850
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,240
I have hashtags.

1851
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,240
But I saw...

1852
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,520
I think...

1853
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,160
I don't know.

1854
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,700
I only had a general hashtag.

1855
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,080
I never needed...

1856
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,360
an art hashtag in the past.

1857
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:22,700
So...

1858
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:24,180
Maybe...

1859
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,520
I don't know.

1860
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:27,720
Maybe we should keep it?

1861
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:32,080
I don't feel like I need more than a general hashtag and a stream hashtag.

1862
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:33,300
Which...

1863
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:40,520
The general hashtag is Mintoshindeishashin Which is basically ghost photography.

1864
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,280
When you're like...

1865
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:48,600
If you're searching spooky ghost photos in Japanese, it's Shindeishashin.

1866
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,180
Please art tag?

1867
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,480
Okay.

1868
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:54,880
I can come up with one later.

1869
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:57,920
And uh...

1870
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,940
Stream hashtag is Mintolive.

1871
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,040
Maybe it should be Mintodead.

1872
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,280
Because I'm never live.

1873
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:06,780
I'm always dead.

1874
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:11,180
You have to know.

1875
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,300
You have to know.

1876
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:18,360
But yeah.

1877
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,780
I mean it's just a general hashtag.

1878
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:24,760
I guess maybe hashtag MintPhantom can be the general hashtag.

1879
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,100
I don't know.

1880
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,000
But there's my oshimark.

1881
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,960
It's a ghost and sparkles.

1882
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,300
In case you're curious.

1883
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:34,060
Uh...

1884
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:36,840
My likes and my dislikes.

1885
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,460
I like anime.

1886
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,180
I like horror.

1887
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,940
I like sweet things.

1888
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,460
I like riding trains.

1889
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:50,000
I like idols.

1890
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,060
I like REM.

1891
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:53,500
I love REM.

1892
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,660
So sweet.

1893
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,420
Actually, I think I need to...

1894
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,300
No, not replace.

1895
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,920
But I think I need to add someone else.

1896
01:18:59,240 --> 01:18:59,640
Okay.

1897
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:02,640
Yeah, I think I need to add someone else.

1898
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:04,520
Because...

1899
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:09,020
You guys, I think I'm seriously in love with FreeRen.

1900
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:12,260
I think...

1901
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:14,320
I think I love FreeRen too much.

1902
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,040
There was a tweet going around when FreeRen was airing.

1903
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,980
It was a Japanese tweet.

1904
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:21,880
About how...

1905
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,960
They were like...

1906
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,400
If you say that you're too in love with FreeRen.

1907
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,020
That's okay.

1908
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,620
Because FreeRen is this generation's Ruri.

1909
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,900
From Nadesco.

1910
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,700
And I love Ruri.

1911
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:37,140
I love Ruri so much.

1912
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,340
But...

1913
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,860
I love...

1914
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:41,900
I love FreeRen.

1915
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:42,740
She's like...

1916
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:45,800
Ruri with like a little extra attitude.

1917
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,020
And I just...

1918
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,500
I love her so much.

1919
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:52,060
I need to add Metal Gear.

1920
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:52,600
That too!

1921
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:57,380
My heart.

1922
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,500
Thanks for the donut.

1923
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:02,780
Thank you so much.

1924
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:03,420
Thank you guys.

1925
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,920
I think we're all caught up.

1926
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:07,500
I think.

1927
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,640
I love...

1928
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,100
Thank you.

1929
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:20,800
Loyalty to the end.

1930
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:22,260
Yes.

1931
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,020
But yeah.

1932
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,880
I love Rem.

1933
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:31,320
And I love FreeRen.

1934
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,480
I've been so obsessed with FreeRen recently.

1935
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,200
I love cute.

1936
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,520
I love anything that's cute.

1937
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:40,220
I love anything Moi.

1938
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,760
Moi is justice.

1939
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:44,360
Martian successor Nadesco.

1940
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:44,780
Yeah!

1941
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:47,140
It's one of my favorite enemies.

1942
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,640
So, so, so, so good.

1943
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,680
And I love dad jokes.

1944
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:53,780
Cause they're funny.

1945
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:54,820
I think.

1946
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,280
Things I don't like are spicy food.

1947
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:00,800
Don't like spicy food.

1948
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,440
I don't like messes.

1949
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,240
Cause I'm a maid.

1950
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,060
And if there's a mess, I gotta clean it up.

1951
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,540
I don't like jumpy things.

1952
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,200
Like...

1953
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:13,820
Cockroaches.

1954
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:15,840
And...

1955
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,860
Crickets.

1956
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:19,540
...

1957
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:19,560
...

1958
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:23,520
...

1959
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,260
...

1960
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,360
I don't like the cold.

1961
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,160
I prefer warmer weather.

1962
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:32,720
And I don't like it when you don't leave snacks.

1963
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:34,140
If I'm visiting you.

1964
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,860
If I'm visiting you in your bedroom.

1965
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:38,360
At night while you're asleep.

1966
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,340
I'm like...

1967
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:41,380
I'm like a ghostly...

1968
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:43,540
I'm like a ghostly Santa Claus.

1969
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:43,820
Okay?

1970
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,860
You gotta leave me like a little something.

1971
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,060
A little offering.

1972
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:49,480
Okay?

1973
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:52,860
Yeah.

1974
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:57,620
So you're like Santa Claus.

1975
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:58,600
That's what I just said.

1976
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,900
Ayo, my bedroom.

1977
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:04,920
Look.

1978
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,180
It's just part of like being a ghost.

1979
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:10,680
I go around and I haunt.

1980
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:12,300
Sometimes...

1981
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,060
It's gonna be a maid cafe.

1982
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,660
You know I gotta check up on...

1983
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:17,940
the master and the mistress.

1984
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:20,460
Just leave some snacks, okay?

1985
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:21,100
You never know.

1986
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,400
That's all you gotta do.

1987
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:30,120
Oh, that's it.

1988
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:30,880
Yay!

1989
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,400
My introduction.

1990
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,560
My introduction.

1991
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:40,560
Okay, now we sing.

1992
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:41,660
Woohoo!

1993
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:43,780
Wahoo!

1994
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,160
I hope we can sing.

1995
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:47,400
My throat is getting...

1996
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:50,780
gradually worse.

1997
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:51,400
I think.

1998
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:52,780
Oh my gosh.

1999
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:53,600
Thank you for the Akadora.

2000
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:54,080
Thank you.

2001
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,160
Thank you so much.

2002
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:58,480
Welcome back to this world makes us all smile knowing you're back.

2003
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,340
Thank you.

2004
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,920
I really thought that...

2005
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:03,660
nobody...

2006
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:06,000
Well, you know, there was people that watched me obviously.

2007
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:07,980
Back in the day.

2008
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:11,380
But I didn't think people would remember me.

2009
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,380
But I didn't think people would remember me.

2010
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,580
So I was really...

2011
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,540
surprised.

2012
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:19,580
Especially...

2013
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:20,940
that there's so many people here.

2014
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:21,960
So...

2015
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,480
I'm just gonna sing for a little bit.

2016
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,540
I don't even know what to sing.

2017
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:28,900
Do you guys have any...

2018
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,260
I will take requests.

2019
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:32,220
Oh, hold on.

2020
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,140
Let's do this.

2021
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,020
Sorry.

2022
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,400
I only have like this scene.

2023
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:39,320
And...

2024
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,320
nothing else.

2025
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,540
I have my intro.

2026
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:46,940
And this scene.

2027
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:49,460
So we're just gonna do karaoke here.

2028
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,160
I hope that's okay.

2029
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:55,760
But I have...

2030
01:23:58,900 --> 01:23:59,980
Hold on.

2031
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:02,680
Setting up a little bit.

2032
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:04,820
Get out of here, music.

2033
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:06,980
It's...

2034
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:08,560
this...

2035
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:09,940
time.

2036
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:12,100
Oh...

2037
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,980
That's not adorable audio, is it?

2038
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,480
I tested it...

2039
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,320
before, but...

2040
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:26,830
Is it...

2041
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:27,450
audio okay?

2042
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:30,270
Is it good?

2043
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:34,010
Okay.

2044
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:40,490
Hello?

2045
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:41,810
Why isn't this one activated?

2046
01:24:42,830 --> 01:24:43,550
Oh, there we go.

2047
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:43,770
Okay.

2048
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:44,750
Nice, nice, nice.

2049
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,210
This is...

2050
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:49,450
This is JoySound on...

2051
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:50,410
the Switch.

2052
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:53,310
So if you're ever like...

2053
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:54,870
Man, I wish I could do Japanese karaoke.

2054
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:57,250
And I'm not just gonna sing...

2055
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:57,830
Japanese songs.

2056
01:24:57,910 --> 01:24:59,050
I can sing whatever I want!

2057
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:00,710
Yippee!

2058
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:04,970
Yippee!

2059
01:25:07,490 --> 01:25:07,970
So...

2060
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:09,230
Yeah.

2061
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:13,070
If they don't have it on here, we can see...

2062
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:15,030
if there's like a karaoke version of it on...

2063
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:15,770
YouTube or something.

2064
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:17,170
But...

2065
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:17,770
Yeah!

2066
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:23,450
Oh...

2067
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:26,790
What should I sing?

2068
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:28,270
Snake... Snake Eater.

2069
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:30,270
You guys, I have a bad...

2070
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:32,690
They don't have Snake Eater on here.

2071
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:35,330
What am I searching?

2072
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:36,170
Oh...

2073
01:25:37,290 --> 01:25:37,930
Me...

2074
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:40,550
Meta...

2075
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:42,770
Metal...

2076
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:45,330
Metal...

2077
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:46,270
Metal...

2078
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:49,650
Yeah...

2079
01:25:52,290 --> 01:25:53,690
They only have two...

2080
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,530
I looked it up earlier because I was testing it.

2081
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:57,050
They only have two...

2082
01:25:58,390 --> 01:25:59,770
Metal Gear songs on here.

2083
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:01,230
And the first...

2084
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:03,790
I kept seeing this one at karaoke in Japan.

2085
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:06,890
I have no idea what this song is.

2086
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:09,430
The Phantom Pain by White Ash.

2087
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:10,690
I looked it up.

2088
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:12,410
I looked...

2089
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:16,140
And I had never heard this song before.

2090
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,620
I was like...

2091
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:19,140
What is this?

2092
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:21,440
The Phantom Pain.

2093
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,200
I have no idea.

2094
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,420
Really good band?

2095
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,260
Oh, you know that?

2096
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,000
Japan only song?

2097
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:32,760
Maybe...

2098
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,540
Do they have Busted on there?

2099
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:35,960
They probably have Ghostbusters.

2100
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:38,120
But I can sing Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday.

2101
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,680
But I think maybe...

2102
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,740
That's like...

2103
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:43,740
We need a better starter song.

2104
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:44,080
Right?

2105
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:46,700
We need a better starter song.

2106
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:48,540
But you know what?

2107
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:49,700
Let's do Ghostbusters.

2108
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,060
Yeah.

2109
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:52,180
Ghost...

2110
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:54,400
Ghost...

2111
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:56,340
Ghost...

2112
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:57,960
Ghost...

2113
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:05,560
Ghostbusters!

2114
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:08,520
Ghostbusters!

2115
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,860
I'm not afraid.

2116
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:15,620
I'm not afraid.

2117
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:17,180
Didn't... What's that group?

2118
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,480
Atarashii Gakko?

2119
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,880
I think they recently did a...

2120
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:22,800
A...

2121
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:25,900
What is the I'm not afraid version?

2122
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:28,240
What is the I'm not afraid version?

2123
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:28,960
What's the Fall Out Boy?

2124
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,340
Huh?

2125
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:32,340
Featuring Missy Elliott.

2126
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:33,280
Huh?

2127
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:38,850
Anyway...

2128
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:41,230
Ghostbusters.

2129
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:44,870
Oh, they don't have the...

2130
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:46,250
Atarashii Gakko version.

2131
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,050
That's okay.

2132
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:49,490
Utau!

2133
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:52,810
Do you guys like my meme?

2134
01:27:56,410 --> 01:27:57,970
Do you guys like my meme?

2135
01:28:01,830 --> 01:28:02,610
This is...

2136
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,690
This is to get us a little warmed up.

2137
01:28:05,970 --> 01:28:06,490
Oh!

2138
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:08,150
It's kind of loud.

2139
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:15,830
Oh, there's

2140
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,460
something strange...

2141
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:35,000
In the neighborhood.

2142
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:37,480
Who you gonna call?

2143
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:38,960
Mint Phantom!

2144
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:42,380
If there's something weird...

2145
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:42,860
And...

2146
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:45,820
Who you gonna call?

2147
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,420
Mint Phantom!

2148
01:28:55,880 --> 01:29:01,610
Is the audio okay?

2149
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:06,450
I ain't afraid of no ghost!

2150
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:08,990
Things...

2151
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:16,550
Running through your...

2152
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:23,530
An invisible man...

2153
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:25,510
Sleeping in your bed...

2154
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:27,130
Who you gonna call?

2155
01:29:28,010 --> 01:29:29,050
Ghostbusters!

2156
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:38,130
I ain't afraid of no ghost!

2157
01:29:38,930 --> 01:29:40,170
Of no

2158
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:46,400
ghost!

2159
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:50,880
I ain't afraid of no ghost!

2160
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,020
Oh, who you gonna call?

2161
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:53,760
Ghostbusters!

2162
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:56,620
If you're all alone...

2163
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:58,660
Pick up the phone...

2164
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,420
And call...

2165
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:02,000
Ghostbusters!

2166
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,020
And call...

2167
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:06,980
I ain't afraid of no ghost!

2168
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:07,900
Garfield!

2169
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:11,100
I hear it likes the girls!

2170
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,380
Is that actually the lyrics?

2171
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:15,260
I ain't afraid of no ghost!

2172
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:18,220
Yeah!

2173
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:18,880
Yeah!

2174
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:19,380
Yeah!

2175
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:20,000
Yeah!

2176
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:20,420
Yeah!

2177
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:20,840
I have

2178
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:29,780
ghost mama!

2179
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:32,180
Freaky ghost baby!

2180
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:33,520
You better call!

2181
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,040
I don't know that part!

2182
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:41,060
I just know freaky ghost baby!

2183
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,740
Freaky ghost man!

2184
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,200
Freaky man baby!

2185
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,680
Freaky ghost man!

2186
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,780
I don't know the original of this song!

2187
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:50,960
Let me tell you something!

2188
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:52,860
Ghostbusters makes me feel good!

2189
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:55,900
Yeah!

2190
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:01,040
I ain't afraid of no ghost!

2191
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:04,040
Oh,

2192
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:14,760
don't get caught alone!

2193
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:16,380
Ghostbusters!

2194
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,380
When it comes through your door!

2195
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,260
Unless you just want some fun!

2196
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:29,130
Ghostbusters!

2197
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:31,170
Who you gonna call?

2198
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:32,930
Ghostbusters!

2199
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:35,770
I think you better call...

2200
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:37,210
Ghostbusters!

2201
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:39,030
Who you gonna call?

2202
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:41,130
Ghostbusters!

2203
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:42,170
I can't hear you!

2204
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:43,650
Who you gonna call?

2205
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,080
Ghostbusters!

2206
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:00,880
Who you gonna call?

2207
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:02,340
Ghostbusters!

2208
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,220
What's the number?

2209
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:06,820
Ghostbusters!

2210
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:08,960
No one gave me the number!

2211
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:10,260
Ghostbusters!

2212
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:12,680
I have to google it myself?

2213
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:14,440
Ghostbusters!

2214
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,640
It's not very informative though.

2215
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,100
What's the number to call them?

2216
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:29,390
Yay!

2217
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:38,610
Please check out Super Ghostbusters Karaoke by FatBirdKaraoke for some good laughs!

2218
01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:40,050
I'll check it out later.

2219
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:41,330
Thank you.

2220
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,130
Alright what else can we sing guys?

2221
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:50,790
I don't I don't I don't know Oh, I know it.

2222
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:53,810
I know that song, obviously, but I don't know how to sing it.

2223
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:55,290
Ikenai Borderline?

2224
01:32:57,450 --> 01:33:01,130
You guys aren't sick of me singing Ikenai Borderline?

2225
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:03,330
Really?

2226
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:06,570
You're not sick of me singing it?

2227
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:09,210
I sang it 50 times.

2228
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:11,730
Really?

2229
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:13,870
You want me to sing Ikenai Borderline again?

2230
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:19,010
My Joy-Con is not very responsive right now.

2231
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:20,830
Really?

2232
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:25,690
We haven't seen you in 3 years, Mint?

2233
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:27,210
Okay, I guess that's true.

2234
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:31,390
But I sang it enough times to make up for 3 years.

2235
01:33:32,990 --> 01:33:33,770
And then some.

2236
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:39,840
Ikenai Borderline 444 times.

2237
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:40,620
Okay,

2238
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,520
this will be the real test of my throat.

2239
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:46,940
Of my voice.

2240
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:49,380
I only got my voice back like...

2241
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:50,840
What's today?

2242
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:51,480
Thursday?

2243
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:53,180
Got it back like Tuesday.

2244
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:57,920
Wee-oo-wee-oo!

2245
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:45,860
We look at each other, we fall in love We chase each other, we chase each other But I want to know more, I'm feeling dizzy The more I wish, the more mysteries The more I think, the hotter it gets That's why I jump in more I'm in a world of mystery Ah,

2246
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:55,280
I believe in love and dreams I believe in everyone But I don't want to be the one to blame

2247
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:25,910
Giri Giri Ai Ikenai Borderline Even if I have no life I'll try to break it all I'll show it to you Giri Giri Mai I'll get used to it My consciousness is melting My body can't control it I might just say it My

2248
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:46,950
friends who made fun of me And the person I've been looking for I'm sparkling for the sake of meeting them again

2249
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:16,490
This is the second one.

2250
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:46,930
A little pause... and we are back.

2251
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:29,890
A little pause... and we are back.

2252
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,240
I'm

2253
01:38:32,290 --> 01:38:32,890
so sorry.

2254
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:37,590
I'm so sorry.

2255
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:38,590
Almost spilled my tea everywhere.

2256
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:45,240
Nice!

2257
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:53,360
Oh, Emily is playing Pokémon.

2258
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,780
I know what you are doing, Emily.

2259
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,420
I know you are playing Pokémon.

2260
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:05,720
What else?

2261
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:07,860
Let's see, what else?

2262
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:10,760
Oh my gosh, I can sing so much.

2263
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:12,640
It's hard to know what to sing.

2264
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:19,280
It's been so long since I've sung that.

2265
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:21,560
I have a cover.

2266
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,000
Oh, Hamtaro!

2267
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:24,800
A bunch of people have been requesting Hamtaro.

2268
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:27,060
Of course I can do Hamtaro.

2269
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,000
Also, it doesn't have to be just...

2270
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,360
This program has English songs too.

2271
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:36,220
So, and like I said, you can request whatever.

2272
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:36,400
Whatever?

2273
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,040
Hamtaro.

2274
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:40,660
Nope.

2275
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,620
You can request whatever.

2276
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:44,440
And...

2277
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:48,520
Yeah.

2278
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:53,520
I'll do my best to do as many as possible.

2279
01:39:56,260 --> 01:39:57,740
Without killing my throat.

2280
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:00,680
Without killing my throat too much, I think.

2281
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:02,780
Oh gosh, I have to be careful here though.

2282
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:04,780
Doing the calls.

2283
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:06,480
Do you guys know Otage?

2284
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:16,280
What?

2285
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:16,920
Omijou..?

2286
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:18,620
Omijou would agree with me.

2287
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:19,100
He would agree.

2288
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:19,120
Ok, on it!

2289
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:19,120
Ok,

2290
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:25,940
I'll try to sing.

2291
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:27,720
Don't worry.

2292
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:27,820
Ok, here we go.

2293
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:29,000
I'm gonna sing.

2294
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,380
I'm gonna sing.

2295
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:32,820
This is a bit...

2296
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:33,300
This is a bit...

2297
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:33,760
I'm

2298
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:38,100
gonna sing.

2299
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:40,700
You can sing.

2300
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:40,920
Ok, I'll sing as well.

2301
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:41,660
You can sing.

2302
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:41,680
You can sing.

2303
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:42,240
Ok, that's it.

2304
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:44,740
Ok, let's go, let's go.

2305
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:44,880
I'm going to sing.

2306
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,740
Wait, I never sang when I was a kid.

2307
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:49,080
I just sang at the same time.

2308
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:07,020
Why

2309
01:41:20,190 --> 01:41:23,150
did the

2310
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:36,360
chat stop?

2311
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:39,820
Why did the chat stop?

2312
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:40,580
Hold on.

2313
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:40,840
Oh!

2314
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,180
I think YouTube froze.

2315
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:43,240
For me.

2316
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:44,400
Am I still streaming?

2317
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:46,780
Uh oh.

2318
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:48,960
Am I still streaming?

2319
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:53,920
I am?

2320
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:59,020
I can only read you guys through OBS.

2321
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:00,920
YouTube completely crashed for me.

2322
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:01,580
Uh oh.

2323
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:04,380
Not even like going to YouTube.com is working.

2324
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:06,980
Oh, here we go.

2325
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:07,620
Okay.

2326
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:07,860
Hold on.

2327
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:23,740
Live stream.

2328
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:25,920
There we go.

2329
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:28,660
There we go.

2330
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:30,460
Let's go.

2331
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,460
Well, I thought it was too powerful.

2332
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:33,240
Truly.

2333
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:36,720
Truly, truly, truly.

2334
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:40,100
Snake Eater?

2335
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:43,560
Are you sure?

2336
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:44,840
I've never... I've never...

2337
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:47,320
I've never sung it.

2338
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:50,260
What if I can't sing it well?

2339
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:52,800
I'm nervous.

2340
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,220
What if I can't do it justice, you guys?

2341
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:58,700
I wonder.

2342
01:42:58,840 --> 01:42:59,100
Hold on.

2343
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:01,360
Snake, Eater, Karaoke.

2344
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:08,730
Oh, I think this one would work.

2345
01:43:10,630 --> 01:43:11,530
It'll be fine.

2346
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:15,570
You say that, please sing Break Stuff by Limp Bizkit.

2347
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:19,130
I can probably do that one too.

2348
01:43:20,550 --> 01:43:22,090
You guys have interesting choices.

2349
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:24,970
Okay, well this one is not obvious.

2350
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:25,950
This one, obviously...

2351
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:26,650
The...

2352
01:43:26,690 --> 01:43:28,770
Joy Sound didn't have it, so I'm gonna hide that.

2353
01:43:30,650 --> 01:43:31,150
Goodbye.

2354
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:34,390
Oh gosh, I'm nervous!

2355
01:43:34,770 --> 01:43:35,910
Oh, I'm nervous!

2356
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:41,870
Let me... let me hear this real quick and make sure it's okay.

2357
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:47,950
Oh wow, it's just the original karaoke though.

2358
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:53,550
I wonder if I'll get copyright struck.

2359
01:43:57,150 --> 01:43:57,590
Hmm...

2360
01:44:01,870 --> 01:44:03,290
This one has like...

2361
01:44:05,770 --> 01:44:09,390
Like, 360p audio quality, 240p audio quality.

2362
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:11,710
So maybe that one's the safer one even though...

2363
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:16,780
Okay, we can try it.

2364
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:17,720
You know what?

2365
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:18,560
I think it's okay.

2366
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:22,160
Okay.

2367
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:29,800
Whoa...

2368
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:31,820
Oh my god.

2369
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:32,720
Oh my god.

2370
01:44:35,280 --> 01:45:03,220
What a thrill With darkness and silence through the night What a thrill I'm searching and I'm melting to you What a fear in my heart, but you're so supreme.

2371
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:11,140
I give my life, not for honor,

2372
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:19,030
take it all in my time.

2373
01:45:21,630 --> 01:45:24,750
There'll be no one else...

2374
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:26,310
Oh my gosh, I'm so nervous.

2375
01:45:29,710 --> 01:45:35,570
Cry, it's the way I fly to you.

2376
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:45,890
I'm still in a dream, snaking up.

2377
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:53,530
Someday you'll go through the rain.

2378
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:59,150
And someday you'll feed on a tree frog.

2379
01:45:59,590 --> 01:46:04,270
This ordeal, the trial to survive.

2380
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:09,750
For the day we see new light.

2381
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:18,590
I give my life, not for honor, but for...

2382
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:24,510
In my time.

2383
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:29,150
There'll be no one

2384
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:33,520
else...

2385
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:40,900
Cry, it's the way I fly to you.

2386
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:51,260
I'm still in a dream, snaking up.

2387
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:55,980
This ordeal, the trial to survive.

2388
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:56,020
I'm still in a dream, snaking up.

2389
01:46:56,020 --> 01:46:56,620
Oh my god.

2390
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:07,980
I'm still in a dream, snaking up.

2391
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:11,780
Snaking up.

2392
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:12,560
Snaking up.

2393
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,340
Snake it up.

2394
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:16,400
Snake it up.

2395
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:25,560
Hold on, I need a cough drop.

2396
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,760
Oh my god!

2397
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:48,130
That was so fun.

2398
01:47:53,970 --> 01:47:55,070
Man, that was so fun.

2399
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:03,960
Okay.

2400
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:04,360
Okay.

2401
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:07,060
Sorry, you can hear a cough drop probably.

2402
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,200
Cynthia Harold will be proud.

2403
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:19,980
I hope so.

2404
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:22,820
If I ever get to meet her.

2405
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:24,420
I'm gonna be like, rape me.

2406
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:26,620
No, actually don't rape me.

2407
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,640
Don't rape me, I'll cry.

2408
01:48:28,780 --> 01:48:29,660
She'll be like...

2409
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:33,120
Cough drop ASMR.

2410
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:34,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2411
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:37,180
Let's see, let's go back to Joystyle.

2412
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:44,570
What else?

2413
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:46,010
What else can we sing?

2414
01:48:46,130 --> 01:48:46,750
We can sing anything.

2415
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:48,890
Practically anything.

2416
01:48:49,390 --> 01:48:50,650
The world is our oyster.

2417
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:55,190
Oh wait.

2418
01:49:00,230 --> 01:49:01,130
There were some requests.

2419
01:49:01,530 --> 01:49:03,030
Oh, Plastic loves a good one.

2420
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:04,650
Actually, I do want to sing that one.

2421
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:05,250
I hope it's okay.

2422
01:49:05,890 --> 01:49:06,290
Wait.

2423
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:10,430
I wonder if it'll show up in English.

2424
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:12,670
Let's try the English first.

2425
01:49:12,810 --> 01:49:13,790
See if it comes up in English.

2426
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:16,610
I'm just playing games.

2427
01:49:17,390 --> 01:49:19,350
I know that's plastic.

2428
01:49:19,630 --> 01:49:20,630
Wow, is that produced?

2429
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:22,430
101 or whatever?

2430
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:27,910
Plastic.

2431
01:49:30,430 --> 01:49:30,830
Plastic.

2432
01:49:34,070 --> 01:49:34,990
Plastic love.

2433
01:49:36,630 --> 01:49:37,150
Plastic love.

2434
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:37,150
Really?

2435
01:49:37,330 --> 01:49:37,850
Nothing yet?

2436
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:38,570
Nothing yet?

2437
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,860
Plastic love.

2438
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:49,620
There it is.

2439
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2440
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:56,940
Juice juice?

2441
01:49:57,460 --> 01:49:57,980
What?

2442
01:49:58,060 --> 01:49:58,360
No way.

2443
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,260
There's a juice juice version.

2444
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:02,460
Oh, sorry.

2445
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,220
I haven't been writing down the set list.

2446
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:06,360
That was beautiful.

2447
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:08,140
Thank you so much!

2448
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:09,800
Thank you for the donations!

2449
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:11,680
Thank you guys for all the donations.

2450
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:14,600
You guys are way too generous, for real.

2451
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:18,600
Oh, it's loud.

2452
01:50:28,090 --> 01:50:29,570
I only cried a little bit.

2453
01:50:30,110 --> 01:50:30,830
Me too.

2454
01:50:32,390 --> 01:50:34,250
I actually cried a little bit.

2455
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:48,920
Oh, Matari's not Ahmad!

2456
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:52,620
Yep.

2457
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:53,700
Sorry, Ahmadju!

2458
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:57,920
Not anymore.

2459
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:00,400
This is not enough.

2460
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,320
It's not enough.

2461
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:07,740
Ma- Mah ko do it.

2462
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:12,060
What the hell

2463
01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:21,210
is she doing?

2464
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:55,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2465
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:56,520
Where is she?

2466
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:40,200
If you're here, say something!

2467
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:43,680
Say something!

2468
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:47,720
Where are you?

2469
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:51,260
Where are

2470
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:55,320
you?

2471
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:55,960
Where are you?

2472
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:58,640
Where are you?

2473
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:09,720
I'm trying to look like we're singing at the same time!

2474
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:28,820
I'm trying to look like we're singing at the same time!

2475
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,660
Where are you?

2476
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:50,570
I'm trying to look like we're singing

2477
01:53:55,490 --> 01:54:00,510
at the same time!

2478
01:54:01,070 --> 01:54:03,670
I'm trying to look like we're singing at the same time!

2479
01:54:06,270 --> 01:54:20,630
I'm just playing games, I know that's plastic love Dance to the plastic beat, another Oh, I almost put you in time out!

01:54:34,730 --> 01:54:39,950

2485
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:10,980
Oh my gosh, I have a cough drop in my mouth the whole time.

2486
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:16,060
Nom nom nom You're doing great, Min.

2487
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:17,120
Thank you so much!

2488
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:18,060
Thank you!

2489
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:20,860
Love that?

2490
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,160
Thank you, thank you.

2491
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:24,640
Thank you, thank you.

2492
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:27,360
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2493
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:28,680
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2494
01:55:29,260 --> 01:55:32,600
Well, oh, she's requested what?

2495
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:34,280
Lips of a... what was it?

2496
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:34,880
Lips of an angel?

2497
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:39,320
With the lips of an angel.

2498
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:41,220
I wonder if they have it.

2499
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:44,240
I don't feel like, I don't know why they wouldn't ask a lot.

2500
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:49,600
With the lips of an angel.

2501
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:52,580
Oh my god, there it is!

2502
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:53,320
No way!

2503
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:56,740
They're pretty good.

2504
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:04,680
Snake.

2505
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:09,580
May I ask which karaoke software this is?

2506
01:56:09,620 --> 01:56:11,820
This is JoySound on the Switch.

2507
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:13,920
You need a Japanese account to get it?

2508
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:21,980
It's free to download it, but to sing, you have to get like a Japanese... oh, hold on.

2509
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:27,340
Honey, why you calling me so late?

2510
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:30,100
You need a, like a Japanese...

2511
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:33,000
It's kinda hard to talk right now.

2512
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:34,640
Cause I'm singing, sorry.

2513
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:39,440
Honey, why you crying?

2514
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:42,120
Is everything okay?

2515
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:47,980
I gotta whisper cause I can't be too loud.

2516
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:59,040
Sometimes I wish she was you.

2517
01:56:59,180 --> 01:57:03,140
I guess we never really moved on.

2518
01:57:05,350 --> 01:57:08,020
It's really good to hear your voice.

2519
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:12,060
Saying my name, it sounds so sweet.

2520
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:15,660
Coming from the lips of an angel.

2521
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:19,780
Hearing those words, it makes me weak.

2522
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:25,360
And I never wanna say goodbye.

2523
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:31,320
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful.

2524
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:37,600
With the lips of an angel.

2525
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:42,600
Oh yeah, you need to have like a...

2526
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:43,580
Oh my gosh, there's more?

2527
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:48,260
It's funny that you're coming to me tonight.

2528
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:54,860
And yes, I've dreamt of you too.

2529
01:57:56,180 --> 01:58:02,240
And does he know you're talking to me?

2530
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:04,760
Will it start a fight?

2531
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:09,740
No, I don't think she has a clue.

2532
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:17,240
Well, my girl's in the next room.

2533
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:20,900
Sometimes I wish she was you.

2534
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:25,240
I guess we never really moved on.

2535
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:29,900
It's really good to hear your voice.

2536
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:33,980
Saying my name, it sounds so sweet.

2537
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:37,480
Coming from the lips of an angel.

2538
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:41,480
Hearing those words, it makes me weak.

2539
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:47,200
And I never wanna say goodbye.

2540
01:58:48,060 --> 01:58:53,120
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful.

2541
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:59,440
With the lips of an angel.

2542
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:01,880
Okay.

2543
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:03,900
Yes, you need a Japanese account.

2544
01:59:04,120 --> 01:59:05,580
But you also need to get...

2545
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:07,160
A Japanese...

2546
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:07,580
Um...

2547
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:08,920
Nintendo...

2548
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:10,100
You need Yen.

2549
01:59:10,160 --> 01:59:10,880
It's like...

2550
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:12,180
300 Yen.

2551
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:14,560
No, 500 Yen for 24 hours.

2552
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:18,260
So, if you know a site that will, like, sell...

2553
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:19,440
Like, uh...

2554
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:20,760
Japanese e-card...

2555
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:21,700
E-e-e-sim card?

2556
01:59:21,820 --> 01:59:22,520
Not sim cards.

2557
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:23,420
You know what I mean.

2558
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:24,220
Nintendo box.

2559
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:29,440
It's really good to hear your voice.

2560
01:59:29,660 --> 01:59:33,460
Saying my name, it sounds so sweet.

2561
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:35,560
Coming from the lips of an angel.

2562
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:40,980
Hearing those words, it makes me weak.

2563
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:46,490
And I wanna say goodbye.

2564
01:59:47,130 --> 01:59:52,830
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful.

2565
01:59:53,590 --> 01:59:54,790
Hard

2566
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:07,400
to be faith...

2567
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:13,320
The lips of an angel.

2568
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:13,960
eShop...

2569
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:30,050
eShop card.

2570
02:00:30,330 --> 02:00:31,350
Yes, thank you.

2571
02:00:32,130 --> 02:00:33,530
Not someone saying...

2572
02:00:34,250 --> 02:00:36,790
those Spotify ads are getting crazy.

2573
02:00:41,130 --> 02:00:41,850
Man...

2574
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:43,930
So funny.

2575
02:00:49,190 --> 02:00:50,750
There's actually a song I want to sing.

2576
02:00:50,930 --> 02:00:52,370
I don't know if they have it though.

2577
02:00:53,050 --> 02:00:56,150
Because every time I would go to karaoke to sing this song...

2578
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:59,310
It always be some weirdo remix version.

2579
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:02,310
I wonder if they have it.

2580
02:01:04,470 --> 02:01:05,290
Do you guys know?

2581
02:01:08,570 --> 02:01:11,130
Actually, can you adjust the... Yeah, I think you can.

2582
02:01:13,190 --> 02:01:13,590
Oh!

2583
02:01:13,630 --> 02:01:14,610
They don't have it!

2584
02:01:14,690 --> 02:01:14,950
Wow!

2585
02:01:16,250 --> 02:01:17,850
Was that one song called Golden?

2586
02:01:21,890 --> 02:01:22,730
Oh, Slumbers.

2587
02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:27,130
I had me sweating for a second.

2588
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:29,300
I did not read...

2589
02:01:30,210 --> 02:01:31,050
Golden Slumbers.

2590
02:01:37,070 --> 02:01:38,650
Thank you so much.

2591
02:01:38,890 --> 02:01:40,350
Thank you for being my Oshii.

2592
02:01:40,470 --> 02:01:41,430
Can you sing Ikanaide?

2593
02:01:41,710 --> 02:01:42,130
Ikanaide?

2594
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:43,310
Oh, I wonder if they have it.

2595
02:01:43,570 --> 02:01:44,150
I'll check.

2596
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:44,530
I'll check.

2597
02:01:48,030 --> 02:01:48,530
Nebika-

2598
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:53,440
Which one would it be though?

2599
02:01:59,410 --> 02:02:00,330
This one, right?

2600
02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:01,210
Oh, they do have it.

2601
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:01,630
Nice!

2602
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:03,650
Oh, my gosh.

2603
02:02:04,050 --> 02:02:04,930
Great, Billy Mays.

2604
02:02:04,950 --> 02:02:05,810
Thank you for the Akadono.

2605
02:02:06,210 --> 02:02:08,050
Did somebody say Nintendo Bucks?

2606
02:02:08,590 --> 02:02:08,950
Man...

2607
02:02:11,710 --> 02:02:12,070
Oi.

2608
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:16,310
I've never...

2609
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:17,970
Actually, maybe I have sung this one before.

2610
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:18,750
I'll get it.

2611
02:02:20,950 --> 02:02:22,930
I wonder if it's a fast version?

2612
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:21,370
I

2613
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:32,640
hope this stays archived.

2614
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:33,900
Me too.

2615
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:42,700
It would be really embarrassing to come back and have my first stream back be unarchived.

2616
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:50,260
There was something else that I thought of while I was singing that.

2617
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:51,680
I can't remember.

2618
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:58,160
Sing sing?

2619
02:05:58,540 --> 02:06:00,180
Oh, FANZA is also a good one.

2620
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:05,420
Okay, let me start making notes so I don't forget any.

2621
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:16,020
I'll do FANZA first.

2622
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:19,240
Wait, oh.

2623
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:20,400
Fa.

2624
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:21,020
Fu.

2625
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:22,040
Fu!

2626
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:23,640
Ha.

2627
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:24,160
Ha.

2628
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:24,320
Hi.

2629
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:24,720
Fu.

2630
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:27,760
Can I do a small ah?

2631
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:28,580
Oh wait.

2632
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:29,320
Fa.

2633
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:30,040
There we go.

2634
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:32,040
FANZA.

2635
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:35,540
Crazy frog.

2636
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:38,880
What?

2637
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:41,360
Oh my gosh!

2638
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:42,340
Wait, no way!

2639
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:44,040
There's a Hololive version of it!

2640
02:06:44,260 --> 02:06:44,740
What?

2641
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:46,300
That's so cool!

2642
02:06:46,780 --> 02:06:48,220
Wait, what's different about it?

2643
02:06:50,260 --> 02:06:50,780
What?

2644
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:51,220
What?

2645
02:06:52,140 --> 02:06:55,920
So I guess this is from the Hololive Honeyworks crossover?

2646
02:06:56,940 --> 02:06:58,740
But what's different about it, I wonder?

2647
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:02,680
Let's try it!

2648
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:03,860
Let's try it!

2649
02:07:07,730 --> 02:07:08,210
Ooh!

2650
02:07:09,110 --> 02:07:10,130
The hamster song.

2651
02:07:24,330 --> 02:07:27,390
Maybe it's the same.

2652
02:07:27,650 --> 02:07:42,550

2685
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:29,000
I'm still eating this one cough drop.

2686
02:11:33,310 --> 02:11:34,850
Oh my god.

2687
02:11:35,250 --> 02:11:35,790
Yay!

2688
02:11:36,110 --> 02:11:36,670
Fansha!

2689
02:11:37,690 --> 02:11:42,070

2690
02:11:42,930 --> 02:11:44,170
Oh my gosh, that was so cute!

2691
02:11:44,230 --> 02:11:44,890
The hollow beam!

2692
02:11:47,650 --> 02:11:49,230
Mint, are you taking karaoke requests?

2693
02:11:49,410 --> 02:11:49,770
I am!

2694
02:11:51,750 --> 02:11:53,790
Suzume by Radwimps Oh, I don't know it.

2695
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:54,530
I'm so sorry.

2696
02:11:55,630 --> 02:11:56,450
I'm so sorry.

2697
02:11:58,530 --> 02:11:59,430
It's probably on here.

2698
02:12:00,830 --> 02:12:02,150
I could do another Radwimps song.

2699
02:12:02,730 --> 02:12:04,010
Oh my gosh, thank you for the akatono!

2700
02:12:05,350 --> 02:12:07,030
I hope you know how amazing you are.

2701
02:12:07,050 --> 02:12:07,730
How much you mean to us.

2702
02:12:07,810 --> 02:12:09,450
No matter what you decide to do in the future.

2703
02:12:09,550 --> 02:12:10,470
We will support you.

2704
02:12:10,470 --> 02:12:11,390
I'll also do your taxes.

2705
02:12:11,770 --> 02:12:12,490
I will.

2706
02:12:12,830 --> 02:12:13,430
Thank you.

2707
02:12:13,870 --> 02:12:15,050
I don't want to do my taxes.

2708
02:12:15,850 --> 02:12:16,990
Red Night Circulation.

2709
02:12:17,170 --> 02:12:18,870
Oh, I could do Red Night Circulation.

2710
02:12:19,330 --> 02:12:20,270
It's fast though.

2711
02:12:20,830 --> 02:12:22,530
I don't know if I can do it so quickly.

2712
02:12:23,770 --> 02:12:24,390
Hololive songs.

2713
02:12:27,250 --> 02:12:29,190
I wonder what Hololive songs are on here.

2714
02:12:29,250 --> 02:12:29,930
Actually, I'm curious.

2715
02:12:34,470 --> 02:12:34,830
Paul...

2716
02:12:35,690 --> 02:12:36,050
No.

2717
02:12:39,650 --> 02:12:41,190
Like if we just search Hololive.

2718
02:12:42,550 --> 02:12:43,450
Which one would it be then?

2719
02:12:43,450 --> 02:12:46,350
The English one or the Japanese one?

2720
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:49,250
Also, I am taking requests.

2721
02:12:49,470 --> 02:12:51,110
So I will sing Sousen Aquarium.

2722
02:12:55,290 --> 02:12:56,490
Sousen Aquarium.

2723
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:02,200
Whoa!

2724
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:10,320
I don't think I could sing many of them confidently though.

2725
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:13,180
Maybe another time.

2726
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:14,680
Next time.

2727
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:15,140
Next time.

2728
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:15,680
Next time.

2729
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:16,060
Next time.

2730
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:18,920
Like I know SHINee's smiley story the mostest.

2731
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:21,100
But I still don't feel confident.

2732
02:13:21,660 --> 02:13:22,960
But there's a lot on here.

2733
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:28,340
I wonder if I do the Japanese if it changes.

2734
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:29,660
Wait.

2735
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:29,960
So no.

2736
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:30,520
Hello EM.

2737
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:35,020
Oh, wait.

2738
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:35,680
Wait.

2739
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,200
Let me try...

2740
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:45,440
Let me try if I search like a member.

2741
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:47,140
Oh.

2742
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:48,140
What did I just click?

2743
02:13:48,180 --> 02:13:48,260
Oh.

2744
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:49,820
Oopsie.

2745
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:50,280
Ah.

2746
02:13:51,340 --> 02:13:52,320
Kiss, kiss.

2747
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:53,420
Kiss, kiss.

2748
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:54,780
Kiss, kiss.

2749
02:13:54,860 --> 02:13:55,520
What if I...

2750
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:56,440
Let's see.

2751
02:13:56,780 --> 02:13:58,740
Like cari...

2752
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:02,200
Cariope.

2753
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:09,200
No.

2754
02:14:09,220 --> 02:14:09,500
Wait.

2755
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:12,340
No.

2756
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:13,440
Oh no.

2757
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:19,140
Or ki...

2758
02:14:19,140 --> 02:14:20,380
Ah.

2759
02:14:20,700 --> 02:14:21,400
Wait.

2760
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:22,240
It would be Takanashi.

2761
02:14:22,280 --> 02:14:22,680
Takanashi.

2762
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:23,480
Ta...

2763
02:14:24,460 --> 02:14:25,060
Ta...

2764
02:14:25,060 --> 02:14:25,960
Ka...

2765
02:14:27,120 --> 02:14:27,720
Na...

2766
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:29,120
Shi...

2767
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:30,220
O...

2768
02:14:30,220 --> 02:14:31,260
Ki...

2769
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:33,160
No.

2770
02:14:34,580 --> 02:14:35,500
Ah, man.

2771
02:14:35,860 --> 02:14:36,620
That's okay.

2772
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:39,620
In English maybe?

2773
02:14:39,820 --> 02:14:40,380
Oh, we can try.

2774
02:14:42,220 --> 02:14:44,820
I actually have a video from the last time I went to karaoke.

2775
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:48,860
Calliope had a message.

2776
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:50,080
Oh.

2777
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:50,460
Oh.

2778
02:14:50,660 --> 02:14:51,260
Oh.

2779
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:51,940
Oh.

2780
02:14:51,940 --> 02:14:52,560
No way.

2781
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:52,660
Oh.

2782
02:14:54,020 --> 02:14:55,260
Oh my god.

2783
02:15:01,460 --> 02:15:02,840
Calliope is on here.

2784
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:03,620
For real.

2785
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:05,320
Oh my gosh.

2786
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:08,000
That's so awesome.

2787
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:09,040
Wait.

2788
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:09,480
Hold on.

2789
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:27,120
Ka...

2790
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:27,420
Wait.

2791
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:27,780
Ta...

2792
02:15:27,780 --> 02:15:28,340
Ka...

2793
02:15:28,340 --> 02:15:29,320
It's right below it.

2794
02:15:29,420 --> 02:15:30,420
I can't read.

2795
02:15:32,420 --> 02:15:32,980
Na...

2796
02:15:36,290 --> 02:15:36,850
Shi...

2797
02:15:40,530 --> 02:15:41,550
Sometimes it's...

2798
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:42,050
Oh no.

2799
02:15:42,570 --> 02:15:43,350
What if I...

2800
02:15:43,350 --> 02:15:43,510
Wait.

2801
02:15:43,530 --> 02:15:44,350
What if I just put in Kiara?

2802
02:15:45,090 --> 02:15:45,650
Ki...

2803
02:15:45,650 --> 02:15:45,790
Na...

2804
02:15:45,810 --> 02:15:46,130
Tiara.

2805
02:15:47,510 --> 02:15:53,470
Sometimes it's more fun going seeing what songs they have on here than actually like singing.

2806
02:15:53,770 --> 02:15:54,270
It's...

2807
02:15:54,810 --> 02:15:55,330
Instead...

2808
02:15:56,830 --> 02:15:57,390
Hmm?

2809
02:16:00,590 --> 02:16:02,530
If I search...

2810
02:16:02,530 --> 02:16:03,430
Ik...

2811
02:16:03,430 --> 02:16:03,630
Wait.

2812
02:16:03,750 --> 02:16:05,530
Kiara Tiara is an equal love song?

2813
02:16:05,590 --> 02:16:05,970
That's so funny.

2814
02:16:06,090 --> 02:16:06,470
Oh!

2815
02:16:06,670 --> 02:16:07,330
Oh my gosh!

2816
02:16:07,470 --> 02:16:07,730
Wait.

2817
02:16:07,810 --> 02:16:08,030
It's...

2818
02:16:08,030 --> 02:16:08,750
This is the...

2819
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:09,850
This is the...

2820
02:16:09,850 --> 02:16:10,630
This is the...

2821
02:16:10,630 --> 02:16:11,930
Also the Honeyworks...

2822
02:16:11,930 --> 02:16:13,930
The Honeyworks collab.

2823
02:16:14,010 --> 02:16:14,630
That's so funny.

2824
02:16:15,210 --> 02:16:16,410
Kobo and Kiara.

2825
02:16:16,930 --> 02:16:18,690
Oh my gosh.

2826
02:16:18,690 --> 02:16:18,790
Wait.

2827
02:16:19,790 --> 02:16:20,350
What if I...

2828
02:16:22,170 --> 02:16:23,470
She's on here a little bit.

2829
02:16:23,590 --> 02:16:24,370
So happy.

2830
02:16:25,430 --> 02:16:26,530
Let's go Kiara.

2831
02:16:26,790 --> 02:16:27,630
I love you.

2832
02:16:32,470 --> 02:16:33,030
Okay.

2833
02:16:33,430 --> 02:16:34,130
Let's see.

2834
02:16:36,410 --> 02:16:36,970
Yeah.

2835
02:16:37,070 --> 02:16:44,870
Unfortunately, this doesn't have like as many songs as it would in like maybe a Japanese karaoke place.

2836
02:16:45,130 --> 02:16:47,830
But it does have a ton, which is really exciting.

2837
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:48,590
It's really fun.

2838
02:16:48,810 --> 02:16:49,190
So...

2839
02:16:50,830 --> 02:16:51,790
Stellar, Stellar.

2840
02:16:51,790 --> 02:16:52,470
Oh my gosh.

2841
02:16:52,630 --> 02:16:53,730
Do you want me to die?

2842
02:16:56,230 --> 02:16:58,670
I don't think I could sing Stellar, Stellar.

2843
02:17:01,250 --> 02:17:02,370
I'm sure they have it.

2844
02:17:05,010 --> 02:17:05,750
Science game!

2845
02:17:13,670 --> 02:17:14,830
There's so much here!

2846
02:17:15,730 --> 02:17:16,330
Oh ha!

2847
02:17:17,550 --> 02:17:18,350
Oh my gosh!

2848
02:17:18,350 --> 02:17:21,590
There is so much here.

2849
02:17:22,310 --> 02:17:22,790
Yo!

2850
02:17:23,030 --> 02:17:23,510
Oh!

2851
02:17:23,510 --> 02:17:23,750
Let's go!

2852
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:23,770
Please!

2853
02:17:27,990 --> 02:17:29,070
Baka mitai?

2854
02:17:29,610 --> 02:17:31,270
I wonder if they even have it.

2855
02:17:32,890 --> 02:17:34,730
Would it be in Japanese or English?

2856
02:17:37,470 --> 02:17:38,410
Let's try it.

2857
02:17:38,590 --> 02:17:39,690
Baka mitai.

2858
02:17:42,650 --> 02:17:43,270
Baka...

2859
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:47,940
Baka mitai.

2860
02:17:47,940 --> 02:17:48,240
Baka mitai.

2861
02:17:54,620 --> 02:17:55,380
No way.

2862
02:17:55,580 --> 02:17:58,540
I don't think it was in Kanji though.

2863
02:17:58,700 --> 02:17:59,720
I don't think this is right, right?

2864
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:02,340
What is this one?

2865
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:05,700
Does it have blue clapper?

2866
02:18:05,780 --> 02:18:06,120
It did!

2867
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:07,340
They did have blue clapper.

2868
02:18:07,660 --> 02:18:08,420
Love deterrence?

2869
02:18:08,440 --> 02:18:10,400
They unfortunately don't have love deterrence.

2870
02:18:10,400 --> 02:18:11,000
I'm so sad.

2871
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:16,200
Odorika.

2872
02:18:18,740 --> 02:18:19,100
Odorika.

2873
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:20,240
That's not the right lyrics.

2874
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:22,240
No, they don't have the actual baka mitai.

2875
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:23,940
Wait, what's the lyrics for this one?

2876
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:25,420
That's what I like about this.

2877
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:27,180
You can kind of see what the start of the song is.

2878
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:30,060
No.

2879
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:31,660
Dang.

2880
02:18:35,660 --> 02:18:36,020
Odorika.

2881
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:38,160
Odorika.

2882
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:39,760
I like that song too.

2883
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,400
You guys are requesting so many.

2884
02:18:42,820 --> 02:18:44,240
I'm not going to be able to do all of them.

2885
02:18:44,300 --> 02:18:44,600
I'm sorry.

2886
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:46,400
Odorika.

2887
02:18:47,860 --> 02:18:49,380
Wait, I just saw it.

2888
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:50,380
Oh wait, I saw it.

2889
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:52,120
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

2890
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:53,160
Odorika.

2891
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:07,060
I think I have to do plus two.

2892
02:19:08,420 --> 02:19:09,580
I think I have to do plus two.

2893
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:10,220
I think

2894
02:19:13,410 --> 02:19:14,030
I have to do plus two.

2895
02:19:14,030 --> 02:19:14,790
Love live song?

2896
02:19:14,990 --> 02:19:15,270
Maybe.

2897
02:19:24,830 --> 02:19:26,490
Is this the key I usually sing in?

2898
02:19:26,670 --> 02:19:27,030
Is this the key I usually sing in?

2899
02:19:27,030 --> 02:19:29,190
I'm

2900
02:19:34,110 --> 02:19:34,110
not sure.

2901
02:19:34,110 --> 02:19:40,390
Oite kita yu na ito ga hitotsu futatsu Oite...

2902
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:43,010
Can't always get that part.

2903
02:19:43,590 --> 02:20:01,370
Chanto hirotte iko o hajikete wasurete shimau wa Mawari dashita ano koto boku no mirai ga

2904
02:20:23,810 --> 02:20:25,170
Oh my god, my throat!

2905
02:20:34,380 --> 02:21:04,900
私 あなたに会ったの 夢の中に置いてきたけどね ねえ どうして 私が好きなの 一度しか会ったことがないのにね 想いを消して 二人してんだ 忘れない愛を歌う Thank you for watching this video.

2906
02:21:04,900 --> 02:21:05,560
I hope you enjoyed it.

2907
02:21:05,560 --> 02:21:14,480
See you in the next video.

2908
02:21:44,040 --> 02:21:45,360
My voice!

2909
02:22:23,860 --> 02:22:41,800
Thank you for watching this video.

2910
02:23:07,440 --> 02:23:09,460
Thank you for watching this video.

2911
02:23:09,460 --> 02:23:09,800
I hope you enjoyed it.

2912
02:23:09,800 --> 02:23:10,540
See you in the next video.

2913
02:23:10,780 --> 02:23:15,600
Thank you for watching this video.

2914
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:21,540
I hope you

2915
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:24,820
enjoyed it.

2916
02:23:24,940 --> 02:23:25,020
Bye!

2917
02:23:28,220 --> 02:23:28,620
So...

2918
02:23:31,220 --> 02:23:31,620
Say...

2919
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:32,660
There it is.

2920
02:23:33,260 --> 02:23:34,000
Wait, which one?

2921
02:23:35,420 --> 02:23:36,180
They're both the same.

2922
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:37,400
Weird.

2923
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:39,040
Oh,

2924
02:23:44,540 --> 02:23:44,740
cool!

2925
02:23:44,900 --> 02:23:45,440
There's so many!

2926
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:48,220
Oh, this is like the anime.

2927
02:23:48,580 --> 02:23:49,440
And then there... okay.

2928
02:23:52,740 --> 02:23:53,140
Yeah!

2929
02:24:00,870 --> 02:24:02,230
Oh my gosh, simple and clean?

2930
02:24:02,530 --> 02:24:03,350
I could do it!

2931
02:24:04,110 --> 02:24:05,010
I could!

2932
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:52,400
Oh my gosh, I can't read!

2933
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:10,720
Oh my gosh, I can't read!

2934
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:38,230
I said Macross!

2935
02:25:38,550 --> 02:25:39,850
It's Aquarian!

2936
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:07,860
I said Macross!

2937
02:26:11,160 --> 02:26:13,100
It's Aquarian!

2938
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:17,420
It's Aquarian!

2939
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:48,300
It's Aquarian!

2940
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:49,140
It's Aquarian!

2941
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:55,440
It's Aquarian!

2942
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:36,880
It's Aquarian!

2943
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:37,700
It's Aquarian!

2944
02:27:37,700 --> 02:27:37,720
It's Aquarian!

2945
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:01,120
It's Aquarian!

2946
02:28:05,300 --> 02:28:06,540
It's Aquarian!

2947
02:28:06,540 --> 02:28:07,080
It's Aquarian!

2948
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:14,000
It's Aquarian!

2949
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:45,960
It can't kill me twice.

2950
02:28:46,180 --> 02:28:47,560
The cough adds to it, you think so?

2951
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:48,820
Here, I'm gonna eat some of our pizza.

2952
02:28:57,530 --> 02:28:59,650
We'll take a little snack break.

2953
02:29:05,210 --> 02:29:06,430
A little snack break.

2954
02:29:07,070 --> 02:29:08,410
Does a ghost get sick?

2955
02:29:08,850 --> 02:29:10,910
There's ghost germs, obviously.

2956
02:29:11,850 --> 02:29:14,010
You know, it just happens and stuff.

2957
02:29:15,070 --> 02:29:15,570
So...

2958
02:29:16,250 --> 02:29:17,410
A.K.B.?

2959
02:29:19,790 --> 02:29:22,850
I can't even imagine the amount of A.K.B.s on here.

2960
02:29:24,890 --> 02:29:26,310
Do you have a specific A.K.B.

2961
02:29:26,390 --> 02:29:26,550
song?

2962
02:29:28,050 --> 02:29:30,390
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

2963
02:29:36,050 --> 02:29:36,730
Mm-mm.

2964
02:29:40,250 --> 02:29:41,810
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

2965
02:29:41,810 --> 02:29:45,830
Any suggestions of songs that I've seen so many times?

2966
02:29:46,390 --> 02:29:47,690
Request a Haruko Momoi song?

2967
02:29:48,110 --> 02:29:48,510
Yes!

2968
02:29:48,850 --> 02:29:49,590
Oh my gosh, yes!

2969
02:29:50,830 --> 02:29:54,190
Actually, that reminds me, I wanted to sing Love, Yixing earlier.

2970
02:29:54,610 --> 02:29:55,330
I thought about it.

2971
02:29:55,630 --> 02:29:56,930
But actually, there's another one.

2972
02:29:58,430 --> 02:29:59,310
If they have it.

2973
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:09,580
Minta, I've definitely never seen you before, but I can definitely tell already I would love your content.

2974
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:10,160
Really?

2975
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:11,540
Thank you.

2976
02:30:11,540 --> 02:30:13,400
Thank you.

2977
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:14,880
Floss on the menu.

2978
02:30:15,900 --> 02:30:16,540
I've never...

2979
02:30:16,940 --> 02:30:17,700
I could try.

2980
02:30:18,280 --> 02:30:19,420
Can we get a Shiny Days?

2981
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:20,460
Yes, we can!

2982
02:30:21,360 --> 02:30:22,360
Okay, I have a list.

2983
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:23,480
I have a list, you guys.

2984
02:30:23,560 --> 02:30:24,100
I have a list.

2985
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:25,600
Oh, simple and clean.

2986
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:26,540
Break stuff.

2987
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:27,820
I have a list.

2988
02:30:27,900 --> 02:30:28,260
I have a list.

2989
02:30:28,280 --> 02:30:28,680
I have a list.

2990
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:29,120
I have a list.

2991
02:30:38,040 --> 02:30:38,940
24 Hours Cinderella.

2992
02:30:39,080 --> 02:30:41,520
If they didn't have Baka Mita, I don't think they'll have 24 Hours Cinderella.

2993
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:41,920
If they didn't have Baka Mita, I don't think they'll have 24 Hours Cinderella.

2994
02:30:48,110 --> 02:30:49,030
If they didn't have Baka Mita, I don't think they'll have 24 Hours Cinderella.

2995
02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:49,910
Look at all this AKB.

2996
02:30:51,350 --> 02:30:52,810
But yeah, I feel like I'm...

2997
02:30:52,810 --> 02:30:52,930
But yeah, I feel like I'm...

2998
02:30:52,930 --> 02:30:53,210
But yeah, I feel like I'm...

2999
02:30:53,210 --> 02:30:53,790
But yeah, I feel like I'm...

3000
02:30:55,630 --> 02:30:56,290
I don't know.

3001
02:30:56,310 --> 02:31:01,550
Just seeing suggestions of songs that I've seen a lot in other streams.

3002
02:31:01,850 --> 02:31:02,610
Look, guys.

3003
02:31:03,050 --> 02:31:08,250
This is our opportunity to sing songs that you may have not seen on stream before.

3004
02:31:09,230 --> 02:31:10,250
That you want to hear.

3005
02:31:10,610 --> 02:31:10,690
That you want to hear.

3006
02:31:13,170 --> 02:31:16,610
I can't guarantee that I'll know it, but I can try.

3007
02:31:18,570 --> 02:31:19,610
Anytime, anywhere.

3008
02:31:19,970 --> 02:31:20,610
Who's that by?

3009
02:31:22,690 --> 02:31:23,610
Anytime, anywhere.

3010
02:31:23,810 --> 02:31:24,650
I'm not sure I know it.

3011
02:31:24,910 --> 02:31:26,090
Do you see his puffs?

3012
02:31:33,820 --> 02:31:34,300
God,

3013
02:31:38,140 --> 02:31:38,760
there's so much.

3014
02:31:38,840 --> 02:31:39,940
Do you see the scroll bar?

3015
02:31:40,400 --> 02:31:41,680
Oh, she ate her mommy.

3016
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:47,340
Actually, there is a...

3017
02:31:51,250 --> 02:31:53,010
There is an AKB song I want to sing.

3018
02:32:02,390 --> 02:32:04,290
I love this AKB song.

3019
02:32:04,570 --> 02:32:05,630
I love this song.

3020
02:32:05,690 --> 02:32:06,410
Any La La Land?

3021
02:32:06,670 --> 02:32:08,330
I always sing La La Land.

3022
02:32:08,650 --> 02:32:12,830
I put La La... I keep writing La La Lady when I'm typing it.

3023
02:32:12,890 --> 02:32:15,610
I put La La Lady, then I put La La Landy.

3024
02:32:27,780 --> 02:32:28,260
And

3025
02:32:33,180 --> 02:32:34,940
then Mayuyu shows up and she's so beautiful!

3026
02:32:42,440 --> 02:32:43,540
What song was it?

3027
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:44,120
The last song?

3028
02:32:44,320 --> 02:32:45,520
What was the last song I sang?

3029
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,200
住み僕の前が見かけ上げ 君が微笑む Weekend

3030
02:32:58,460 --> 02:32:59,420
突然久しぶり会いたいなんて どうしたんだ

3031
02:33:05,900 --> 02:33:06,860
意外に混んでるビーチハウス 季節外れのビーチハウス

3032
02:33:13,060 --> 02:33:15,060
僕たち好きだったパンケーキが来ない 僕たち好きだったパンケーキが来ない Yeah, Aquarian!

3033
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:21,780
左手を立てて 薬指指さして キスしてたのは Oh my gosh, sorry.

3034
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:23,020
There's a little bit of lag for me.

3035
02:33:27,800 --> 02:33:29,000
新しい彼氏ができたってこと 言いたかったのか

3036
02:33:33,770 --> 02:33:41,110
君の勝ち 君の勝ち 11月のアンクレート 11月のアンクレート 今でも 外せない

3037
02:33:44,850 --> 02:33:51,470
君にもらったあの日の 二人のシンクレ 君にもらったあの日の 二人のシンクレ さよならに こんにちは

3038
02:33:55,370 --> 02:33:58,530
僕より優しい人と 出会ってたのなら 僕より優しい人と 出会ってたのなら

3039
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:39,140
Oh my god, I'm getting the timing wrong.

3040
02:35:44,460 --> 02:35:46,040
A little pause... and we are back.

3041
02:36:00,200 --> 02:36:00,640
Okay,

3042
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:25,740
I'm going to try and write a set list.

3043
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:28,700
Do we remember what we sang?

3044
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:29,580
Oh gosh.

3045
02:36:31,540 --> 02:36:33,680
I'm going to try and write a set list, you guys.

3046
02:36:34,320 --> 02:36:35,000
Set list.

3047
02:36:35,780 --> 02:36:36,220
One.

3048
02:36:38,200 --> 02:36:40,220
What was the first song that I sang?

3049
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:41,640
Oh my gosh.

3050
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:42,380
No way!

3051
02:36:43,160 --> 02:36:44,560
You have the whole thing, Shimeji!

3052
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:45,060
Thank you!

3053
02:36:45,560 --> 02:36:46,240
Ghostbusters.

3054
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:46,960

3060
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:01,160
Five.

3061
02:37:02,620 --> 02:37:03,620
Plastic Love.

3062
02:37:04,080 --> 02:37:04,760
Six.

3063
02:37:05,960 --> 02:37:06,640
E...

3064
02:37:07,860 --> 02:37:08,560
Ikanaide.

3065
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:10,300
Seven.

3066
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:11,660

3067
02:37:12,060 --> 02:37:12,760

02:37:23,940 --> 02:37:24,700
Juichi Gatsu.

3074
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:25,860
No.

3075
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:26,700
Enclit.

3076
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:27,960
By Ikebi.

3077
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:31,280
Probably nobody knows.

3078
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:31,540
Oh!

3079
02:37:31,620 --> 02:37:31,900
Sorry!

3080
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:33,600
I just realized it's so big.

3081
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:35,100
Well done.

3082
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:37,100
Thank you.

3083
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:37,600
I'll give you a second.

3084
02:37:42,340 --> 02:37:43,420
That's the outline.

3085
02:37:44,380 --> 02:37:45,900
Let's give it a pretty...

3086
02:37:46,840 --> 02:37:47,440
black.

3087
02:37:49,300 --> 02:37:50,520
There we go!

3088
02:37:52,760 --> 02:37:53,920
We're back, baby!

3089
02:37:55,180 --> 02:37:56,320
We're back, baby.

3090
02:37:57,400 --> 02:37:58,620
Let's do a different font.

3091
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:01,760
This one.

3092
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:03,640
No.

3093
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:04,480
That's ugly.

3094
02:38:05,660 --> 02:38:06,940
Why does it look like that?

3095
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:09,340
Why does it look even worse?

3096
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:18,300
This one.

3097
02:38:20,600 --> 02:38:21,000
Whatever.

3098
02:38:21,180 --> 02:38:21,700
It's fine.

3099
02:38:23,860 --> 02:38:25,360
How long have I been streaming for?

3100
02:38:25,820 --> 02:38:26,680
Almost three hours.

3101
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:32,620
I'm gonna probably finish up these songs that I have written down.

3102
02:38:33,440 --> 02:38:35,020
And then I'm gonna call it, I think.

3103
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:35,780
But that's okay.

3104
02:38:35,780 --> 02:38:39,140
It's still one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight songs.

3105
02:38:39,680 --> 02:38:40,660
It's still eight songs.

3106
02:38:40,820 --> 02:38:40,920
Oh!

3107
02:38:40,960 --> 02:38:41,640
Lips of an Angel.

3108
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:42,300
He is missing.

3109
02:38:42,400 --> 02:38:42,760
You're right.

3110
02:38:43,800 --> 02:38:45,000
I trusted you.

3111
02:38:56,050 --> 02:38:57,430
When did I sing that?

3112
02:39:03,820 --> 02:39:05,620
Heaven's Divide Vinyl Addict.

3113
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:05,800
Okay.

3114
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:06,840
That will be the last song I sing.

3115
02:39:07,180 --> 02:39:07,580
Oh.

3116
02:39:09,060 --> 02:39:09,760
What happened?

3117
02:39:17,790 --> 02:39:18,190
Okay.

3118
02:39:18,770 --> 02:39:19,170
Okay.

3119
02:39:19,330 --> 02:39:19,750
I have a list.

3120
02:39:21,370 --> 02:39:21,770
I have a list.

3121
02:39:24,200 --> 02:39:27,360
Sorry if you just heard the biggest gulp I've ever done in my life.

3122
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:31,740
I don't think I chewed that properly.

3123
02:39:33,460 --> 02:39:35,780
I think if I sing this song, I'm going to cry.

3124
02:39:37,940 --> 02:39:38,540
I don't know.

3125
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:39,900
For some reason, this song makes me cry.

3126
02:39:40,140 --> 02:39:41,740
But I'll do my best.

3127
02:39:42,520 --> 02:39:42,900
Oh.

3128
02:39:43,400 --> 02:39:43,780
Um.

3129
02:39:44,040 --> 02:39:44,420
Wait.

3130
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:45,400
Who is it by again?

3131
02:39:46,360 --> 02:39:46,740
Oh.

3132
02:39:46,780 --> 02:39:47,180
There it is.

3133
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:48,100
Hahaha.

3134
02:39:53,540 --> 02:39:55,360
I hope you're hydrated enough throughout the karaoke.

3135
02:39:55,520 --> 02:39:55,840
I am.

3136
02:39:55,840 --> 02:39:56,400
Thank you!

3137
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:57,060
Thank you.

3138
02:40:02,040 --> 02:40:03,000
Okay.

3139
02:40:03,720 --> 02:40:04,960
Hahaha.

3140
02:40:05,860 --> 02:40:06,540
Beep beep.

3141
02:40:15,770 --> 02:40:16,930
Sing.

3142
02:40:18,030 --> 02:40:20,690
Sing a song.

3143
02:40:21,390 --> 02:40:24,270
Sing out loud.

3144
02:40:24,910 --> 02:40:27,670
Sing out strong.

3145
02:40:29,690 --> 02:40:34,190
Sing of good things, not bad.

3146
02:40:36,610 --> 02:40:39,110
Sing of sorrow, not conflict.

3147
02:40:39,130 --> 02:41:09,110
A little pause... and we are back.

3148
02:41:50,860 --> 02:41:55,700
A little pause... and we are back.

3149
02:41:55,720 --> 02:42:00,300
Make it simple to last your whole life long.

3150
02:42:02,620 --> 02:42:08,980
Don't worry that it's not good enough for anyone else to hear.

3151
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:11,240
Just sing.

3152
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:15,160
Sing a song.

3153
02:42:16,480 --> 02:42:18,400
Just sing.

3154
02:42:19,380 --> 02:42:22,100
Sing a song.

3155
02:42:23,240 --> 02:42:25,100
Just sing.

3156
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:28,920
Sing a song.

3157
02:43:11,410 --> 02:43:12,950
I don't think...

3158
02:43:15,800 --> 02:43:19,960
I don't think my version does justice the version that I like to listen to.

3159
02:43:23,060 --> 02:43:23,620
Sing!

3160
02:43:24,660 --> 02:43:28,420
Actually, there's another Carpenter song that I've been listening to a lot.

3161
02:43:29,180 --> 02:43:30,580
Wait, what's it called again?

3162
02:43:30,860 --> 02:43:32,260
Oh shoot, hold on.

3163
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:35,720
One second.

3164
02:43:35,800 --> 02:43:36,800
One second.

3165
02:43:49,220 --> 02:43:50,060
Carpenter is so good.

3166
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:50,700
I know, right?

3167
02:43:54,320 --> 02:43:55,620
I've never sung this one before.

3168
02:44:03,740 --> 02:44:04,920
So it might be bad.

3169
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:07,320
I wonder if there's Final Fantasy.

3170
02:44:07,460 --> 02:44:07,880
Oh my gosh.

3171
02:44:07,940 --> 02:44:11,060
Every time I'm just like, this is all the songs that I will sing.

3172
02:44:11,900 --> 02:44:13,200
I change my mind.

3173
02:44:13,240 --> 02:44:16,380
I'm just like, wait, I wonder if there's Final Fantasy songs on here that I can sing.

3174
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:24,620
Close to you.

3175
02:44:28,540 --> 02:44:29,960
They have like eyes on me.

3176
02:44:31,340 --> 02:44:32,420
I want to sing it.

3177
02:44:37,580 --> 02:44:38,140
Let's go!

3178
02:44:40,740 --> 02:44:42,160
I've never sung this song before.

3179
02:44:42,260 --> 02:44:42,860
I'm kind of nervous.

3180
02:44:48,350 --> 02:44:48,830
I've never sung this song before.

3181
02:44:48,830 --> 02:44:48,830
I'm kind of nervous.

3182
02:44:48,830 --> 02:44:50,230
I've never

3183
02:45:01,780 --> 02:45:01,780
sung this song before.

3184
02:45:01,780 --> 02:45:01,780
I'm kind of nervous.

3185
02:45:01,780 --> 02:45:04,600
Why do birds sing?

3186
02:45:06,480 --> 02:45:20,820
Every time you are near, just like me, they long to be close to you.

3187
02:45:23,060 --> 02:45:28,320
Why do stars fall down from the sky?

3188
02:45:28,320 --> 02:45:42,640
Every time you walk by, just like me, they long to be close to you.

3189
02:45:43,260 --> 02:45:45,320
My throat is giving out a little bit.

3190
02:45:46,260 --> 02:45:55,500
On the day that you were born, the angels got together and decided to create a dream come true.

3191
02:45:55,500 --> 02:46:03,320
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair and gold and starlight in your eyes of blue.

3192
02:46:04,360 --> 02:46:16,740
That is why all the girls in town follow you all around.

3193
02:46:18,560 --> 02:46:26,340
Just like me, they long to be close to you.

3194
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:30,320
On the

3195
02:46:52,810 --> 02:47:01,070
day that you were born, the angels got together and decided to create a dream come true.

3196
02:47:01,670 --> 02:47:08,830
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair and gold and starlight in your eyes of blue.

3197
02:47:11,990 --> 02:47:18,810
That is why all the girls in town follow you all around.

3198
02:47:23,110 --> 02:47:44,190
Just like me, they long to be close to you Just like me, they long to be close to you

3199
02:47:53,300 --> 02:47:57,180
Just like me,

3200
02:48:00,580 --> 02:48:02,960
they long to be close to

3201
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:44,290
you Haruko?

3202
02:48:44,490 --> 02:48:44,890
Haruko?

3203
02:48:45,150 --> 02:48:45,510
Haruko?

3204
02:48:51,820 --> 02:48:53,160
Oh, nope, nope, nope.

3205
02:48:53,240 --> 02:48:53,920
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

3206
02:48:55,980 --> 02:48:58,540
Oh, I wanted to also sing maybe some Dempagumi.

3207
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:01,460
There's too many songs I want to sing.

3208
02:49:03,360 --> 02:49:06,120
Wait, since I can't do a dot, maybe just the X again.

3209
02:49:08,080 --> 02:49:08,660
No, no.

3210
02:49:08,740 --> 02:49:09,380
Okay, space.

3211
02:49:13,640 --> 02:49:14,480
E... X...

3212
02:49:15,500 --> 02:49:15,920
No!

3213
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:16,560
No!

3214
02:49:18,200 --> 02:49:18,900
Okay, hold on.

3215
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:20,140
Let me search Momo and Haruko.

3216
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:21,020
Let's see what they have.

3217
02:49:25,500 --> 02:49:26,420
No, Momo!

3218
02:49:26,700 --> 02:49:28,660
10 hour stream, for real though.

3219
02:49:30,400 --> 02:49:33,340
No, I'm not going to keep you guys so long, don't worry.

3220
02:49:48,130 --> 02:49:51,050
They do have under 17, which is another...

3221
02:49:52,010 --> 02:49:52,470
Popotan!

3222
02:49:53,810 --> 02:49:57,350
I wasn't going to sing Popotan, but I was thinking of another under 17 song.

3223
02:50:01,070 --> 02:50:03,470
Wait, is this Mouse?

3224
02:50:03,790 --> 02:50:04,710
Chu Mouse.

3225
02:50:07,990 --> 02:50:10,410
Oh no, there's Mouse.

3226
02:50:10,570 --> 02:50:11,430
Chu Mouse.

3227
02:50:11,530 --> 02:50:12,650
Wait, they do have I Know Medicine.

3228
02:50:12,730 --> 02:50:14,370
That's the one I was going to sing, not Popotan.

3229
02:50:17,090 --> 02:50:18,370
They do have it.

3230
02:50:18,770 --> 02:50:21,090
I just had to search Balder Force instead.

3231
02:50:23,550 --> 02:50:24,210
Okay.

3232
02:50:31,500 --> 02:50:32,780
I'll have to do it.

3233
02:50:32,780 --> 02:50:36,380
Yeah, I'll have to do a dedicated karaoke stream sometime.

3234
02:50:48,700 --> 02:50:49,720
Okay, sorry.

3235
02:51:16,420 --> 02:51:31,100
Without pushing the fleeting beat of a war I chase the flowing time And run through the world Ahh!

3236
02:51:31,900 --> 02:51:32,740
I

3237
02:51:49,270 --> 02:51:55,370
can use it to separate good and bad I'm sure

3238
02:52:01,250 --> 02:52:07,050
my heart, my life is here Off

3239
02:52:11,110 --> 02:52:13,750
to a new tomorrow Here I go!

3240
02:52:14,250 --> 02:52:15,850
Without pushing the fleeting beat

3241
02:52:29,310 --> 02:53:03,710
of a war I chase the flowing time And run through the world A little pause...

3242
02:53:15,160 --> 02:53:16,340
and we are back.

3243
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:44,500
A little pause... and we are back.

3244
02:54:18,480 --> 02:54:19,260
A

3245
02:54:36,950 --> 02:54:42,510
little pause... and we are back.

3246
02:54:42,510 --> 02:54:44,310
With your arm movements, you kind of like make an X.

3247
02:55:13,550 --> 02:55:15,350
With your arm movements, you kind of like make an X.

3248
02:55:15,890 --> 02:55:16,130
Widen your mind and think.

3249
02:55:16,510 --> 02:55:25,930
If you find yourself again If you find yourself again Even if your tears Even if your tears Shine Shine Shine

3250
02:55:34,120 --> 02:55:57,900
Shine Hey Trink!

3251
02:55:58,000 --> 02:55:58,100
Hey Trink!

3252
02:56:03,140 --> 02:56:04,660
I'm having so much fun though!

3253
02:56:05,660 --> 02:56:09,260
Even though my throat is starting to get worse and worse I don't want to stop!

3254
02:56:11,700 --> 02:56:12,100
Momoi...

3255
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:14,320
Actually, since I did that one...

3256
02:56:14,320 --> 02:56:14,340
No!

3257
02:56:14,780 --> 02:56:15,460
I lied.

3258
02:56:15,580 --> 02:56:16,740
I am gonna do that one.

3259
02:56:17,180 --> 02:56:18,140
I said I was only...

3260
02:56:18,140 --> 02:56:20,300
I was like, maybe I'll only do one Momoi Haruko song.

3261
02:56:20,740 --> 02:56:21,140
No.

3262
02:56:21,660 --> 02:56:22,720
I want to do two.

3263
02:56:24,120 --> 02:56:25,900
This is one of my favorite anime ever.

3264
02:56:39,670 --> 02:56:41,450
The list gets longer, it does.

3265
02:56:43,630 --> 02:56:45,550
Wait, I need to also set a list.

3266
02:56:46,350 --> 02:56:46,750
Love.

3267
02:56:50,170 --> 02:56:50,370
No,

3268
02:56:53,530 --> 02:56:54,070
no, no, no, no.

3269
02:56:54,390 --> 02:56:55,170
Don't make me, don't make me.

3270
02:58:30,910 --> 02:58:31,050
I can't stop.

3271
02:58:35,470 --> 02:58:36,310
I can't stop.

3272
02:58:36,310 --> 02:58:36,530
No more.

3273
02:58:36,690 --> 02:58:41,210
I can't stand it anymore.

3274
02:58:41,610 --> 02:58:42,270
Heart.

3275
02:58:46,010 --> 02:58:47,010
Little child.

3276
02:58:48,170 --> 02:58:49,370
I'm gonna blame you.

3277
02:58:49,950 --> 02:58:50,470
I'm gonna laugh.

3278
02:58:52,770 --> 02:58:53,430
I'm

3279
02:59:02,960 --> 02:59:03,280
gonna laugh.

3280
02:59:04,600 --> 02:59:05,260
Genes.

3281
02:59:05,700 --> 02:59:07,060
I'll make my wish come true.

3282
02:59:08,280 --> 02:59:09,560
It's gonna take a long time.

3283
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:12,190
But I'll do my best.

3284
02:59:13,660 --> 02:59:14,320
I'll do my best.

3285
02:59:14,320 --> 02:59:14,860
Magical.

3286
02:59:42,180 --> 02:59:43,480
I love this show!

3287
02:59:43,980 --> 02:59:44,820
So much!

3288
02:59:46,580 --> 02:59:50,840
Soul Taker is fine too, but I love Nurse of Chikamugi the most.

3289
03:00:09,090 --> 03:00:10,530
Magical, magical nurse.

3290
03:00:11,050 --> 03:00:13,790
A wonderful throbbing.

3291
03:00:14,370 --> 03:00:16,570
I'm sure this is the end.

3292
03:00:52,350 --> 03:00:53,520
I'm okay.

3293
03:00:55,040 --> 03:00:56,100
I'm okay.

3294
03:00:56,440 --> 03:00:58,340
That was the medicine of love.

3295
03:00:59,240 --> 03:01:02,300
The medicine of love.

3296
03:01:02,300 --> 03:01:03,480
That was my medicine.

3297
03:01:06,070 --> 03:01:06,920
Are you?

3298
03:01:07,060 --> 03:01:07,900
Yeah, I'm okay.

3299
03:01:11,640 --> 03:01:12,580
Next song!

3300
03:01:16,360 --> 03:01:17,320
Next song...

3301
03:01:21,460 --> 03:01:27,040
Sorry guys, I already have... If you're still sending songs, I already have a list that I'm gonna...

3302
03:01:27,040 --> 03:01:29,160
That I've already decided...

3303
03:01:29,160 --> 03:01:31,580
Unless I decide to add my own...

3304
03:01:31,580 --> 03:01:32,940
Wait, is it Shiny with an E?

3305
03:01:37,360 --> 03:01:38,540
Oh, there it is.

3306
03:01:39,980 --> 03:01:42,520
Right below Shiny's smiley story.

3307
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:46,640
Asaka!

3308
03:01:46,960 --> 03:01:48,140
I love Asaka.

3309
03:01:48,240 --> 03:01:51,960
Asaka, maybe, has become one of my top...

3310
03:01:51,960 --> 03:01:52,800
Not maybe.

3311
03:01:52,940 --> 03:01:55,880
She is one of my top favorite anime song singers.

3312
03:01:56,160 --> 03:01:57,040
She's so awesome.

3313
03:01:57,300 --> 03:01:58,120
She's so nice.

3314
03:01:58,260 --> 03:01:58,900
I love her.

3315
03:02:01,080 --> 03:02:02,620
I love her so, so much.

3316
03:02:06,560 --> 03:02:08,580
Happy Yutacamp Day, everybody!

3317
03:02:10,380 --> 03:02:11,060
This

3318
03:02:30,290 --> 03:02:31,470
is the best song I've ever heard.

3319
03:02:32,030 --> 03:02:34,990
She's a nice girl.

3320
03:02:36,030 --> 03:02:36,370
She's so sweet!

3321
03:02:36,370 --> 03:02:37,090
She's a nice girl.

3322
03:02:40,850 --> 03:02:41,530
I love her.

3323
03:02:41,630 --> 03:02:42,010
I love her.

3324
03:02:42,110 --> 03:02:43,470
I love her.

3325
03:02:43,570 --> 03:02:44,730
This is cute.

3326
03:02:44,730 --> 03:02:45,530
I love her.

3327
03:02:46,170 --> 03:02:46,910
I love her so much.

3328
03:02:46,910 --> 03:02:49,070
I thought I heard you were going to say something.

3329
03:02:49,070 --> 03:02:50,410
Me too.

3330
03:02:50,590 --> 03:02:51,370
At least I know this song.

3331
03:02:51,370 --> 03:02:53,050
I like Yutacamp.

3332
03:02:53,690 --> 03:02:54,130
That is the coolest song.

3333
03:02:54,450 --> 03:02:57,830
I love Yutacamp!

3334
03:02:57,830 --> 03:02:57,950
I love Yutacamp!

3335
03:02:58,250 --> 03:02:58,930
This is fun.

3336
03:03:00,820 --> 03:03:12,240
Shining days, atarashii kaze Hazuraya no na stepu fun de go my way Can you feel?

3344
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:29,020
Oh god, I'm so sorry!

3345
03:06:03,390 --> 03:06:07,590
Cut some of the song list and cut some of it out.

3346
03:06:08,170 --> 03:06:09,230
I'm so sorry!

3347
03:06:31,080 --> 03:06:32,100
I can't stop!

3348
03:06:32,840 --> 03:06:34,900
I can't stop!

3349
03:06:35,440 --> 03:06:37,640
Oh god, we'll do one last song.

3350
03:06:39,060 --> 03:06:41,280
If I can make it to one more.

3351
03:06:41,640 --> 03:06:42,860
I don't even know if I can!

3352
03:06:43,220 --> 03:06:43,960
Oh, the hang.

3353
03:06:46,860 --> 03:06:48,120
I have another cough drop.

3354
03:06:50,280 --> 03:06:51,120
And I drink.

3355
03:07:12,050 --> 03:07:14,710
Sorry, someone suggested Diamond Crevice.

3356
03:07:14,770 --> 03:07:16,590
I really want to sing it, but I don't think I'll be able to.

3357
03:07:18,530 --> 03:07:19,330
Or break stuff.

3358
03:07:19,450 --> 03:07:20,090
Or La La Land.

3359
03:07:20,810 --> 03:07:21,770
Or simply clean.

3360
03:07:22,090 --> 03:07:24,250
But I'll just have to do another karaoke sometime.

3361
03:07:24,830 --> 03:07:25,230
Right?

3362
03:07:30,010 --> 03:07:30,410
Probably.

3363
03:07:34,940 --> 03:07:35,340
Okay.

3364
03:07:36,800 --> 03:07:38,300
Let me check if this is good.

3365
03:07:41,160 --> 03:07:41,760
One second.

3366
03:07:43,820 --> 03:07:44,620
One second.

3367
03:07:44,760 --> 03:07:45,080
One second.

3368
03:07:48,020 --> 03:07:48,540
Okay.

3369
03:07:53,580 --> 03:07:54,460
Yeah, good enough.

3370
03:08:00,440 --> 03:08:01,520
Last song, everybody.

3371
03:08:01,780 --> 03:08:02,700
I'm so sorry about that.

3372
03:08:02,800 --> 03:08:03,920
I wish I could sing more, but...

3373
03:08:05,760 --> 03:08:10,700
Thank you again for welcoming me back so warmly.

3374
03:08:10,720 --> 03:08:13,680
I didn't expect so many people to be here.

3375
03:08:15,520 --> 03:08:16,940
But I really appreciate it.

3376
03:08:16,940 --> 03:08:17,960
Thank you for all the donations.

3377
03:08:18,060 --> 03:08:19,060
Thank you for subbing.

3378
03:08:19,120 --> 03:08:23,040
Thank you for even just remembering me even a tiny little bit.

3379
03:08:23,220 --> 03:08:26,960
I really, really, really, really, really, really appreciate it.

3380
03:08:27,060 --> 03:08:28,300
I'm so shocked.

3381
03:08:29,960 --> 03:08:30,400
But...

3382
03:08:33,200 --> 03:08:33,640
Yeah.

3383
03:08:33,640 --> 03:08:35,840
Really happy to be here.

3384
03:08:36,280 --> 03:08:39,120
To be able to hang out with you guys some more.

3385
03:08:40,840 --> 03:08:41,660
And everything.

3386
03:08:41,980 --> 03:08:42,560
Look at that.

3387
03:08:42,620 --> 03:08:43,760
The cough drop helped so much.

3388
03:08:44,040 --> 03:08:45,540
Maybe I can do Diamond Crevice.

3389
03:08:48,060 --> 03:08:48,540
Hmm...

3390
03:08:48,540 --> 03:08:49,600
No, I shouldn't.

3391
03:08:49,660 --> 03:08:50,080
I shouldn't.

3392
03:08:50,400 --> 03:08:51,660
I'll save it for next time.

3393
03:08:52,940 --> 03:08:54,140
I'll save it for next time.

3394
03:08:55,100 --> 03:08:56,620
Glamatara introduced me to you.

3395
03:08:56,740 --> 03:08:56,980
Yeah!

3396
03:08:57,140 --> 03:08:58,040
Thank you!

3397
03:08:59,540 --> 03:09:00,760
Thank you so much.

3398
03:09:01,440 --> 03:09:02,900
I'm just a little ghost.

3399
03:09:03,160 --> 03:09:04,560
And I'm just a little maid.

3400
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:05,480
But...

3401
03:09:05,480 --> 03:09:07,540
I'll do my best to...

3402
03:09:07,540 --> 03:09:12,820
Hopefully we can have a fun time and make lots of awesome memories.

3403
03:09:13,040 --> 03:09:13,500
And...

3404
03:09:14,020 --> 03:09:14,500
Yeah.

3405
03:09:17,740 --> 03:09:18,220
Um...

3406
03:09:18,820 --> 03:09:19,300
Hmm...

3407
03:09:19,940 --> 03:09:20,900
Thank you for the Hakadono!

3408
03:09:20,960 --> 03:09:21,560
Thank you!

3409
03:09:22,400 --> 03:09:24,960
Hope we weren't too flustered by all your new adoring fans.

3410
03:09:25,260 --> 03:09:26,440
Keep rocking and being you.

3411
03:09:26,560 --> 03:09:27,320
We believe in you.

3412
03:09:27,600 --> 03:09:28,440
Thank you!

3413
03:09:30,020 --> 03:09:30,780
Thank you.

3414
03:09:30,860 --> 03:09:33,300
I can't wait to do so many things.

3415
03:09:33,700 --> 03:09:36,820
Did you guys know that I own a Metal Gear patchy slot machine?

3416
03:09:40,860 --> 03:09:41,340
Hmm...

3417
03:09:41,340 --> 03:09:43,120
I haven't thought...

3418
03:09:43,120 --> 03:09:43,420
Like...

3419
03:09:43,420 --> 03:09:45,520
I don't know at all what I'm doing next week.

3420
03:09:46,180 --> 03:09:46,580
Uh...

3421
03:09:46,580 --> 03:09:48,620
I don't know when the next stream is even.

3422
03:09:50,060 --> 03:09:51,120
I don't know anything.

3423
03:09:52,740 --> 03:09:53,140
Um...

3424
03:09:53,140 --> 03:09:53,700
So...

3425
03:09:53,700 --> 03:09:56,180
I hope that you guys will be a little patient with me.

3426
03:09:56,240 --> 03:09:58,220
I kind of just really jumped back in.

3427
03:09:58,260 --> 03:09:59,040
I was just like, you know what?

3428
03:09:59,100 --> 03:10:00,600
I'll come back on Thursday.

3429
03:10:00,900 --> 03:10:01,780
And now...

3430
03:10:01,780 --> 03:10:03,280
Like I don't think I'm gonna stream tomorrow.

3431
03:10:04,140 --> 03:10:04,540
Maybe...

3432
03:10:04,540 --> 03:10:05,020
I don't know.

3433
03:10:05,080 --> 03:10:06,680
I'll try and make schedules.

3434
03:10:07,520 --> 03:10:07,920
Um...

3435
03:10:10,120 --> 03:10:10,520
Yeah.

3436
03:10:10,680 --> 03:10:11,560
It's just...

3437
03:10:11,560 --> 03:10:13,140
How about some block game?

3438
03:10:13,260 --> 03:10:13,760
I don't...

3439
03:10:13,760 --> 03:10:14,180
I don't know.

3440
03:10:14,180 --> 03:10:15,080
I don't have a server.

3441
03:10:16,880 --> 03:10:17,540
Or anything.

3442
03:10:18,020 --> 03:10:23,240
But I guess I should start streaming soon so I can hit monetization or something.

3443
03:10:23,780 --> 03:10:24,580
I don't know.

3444
03:10:25,020 --> 03:10:25,680
It's fine.

3445
03:10:26,340 --> 03:10:26,780
Okay.

3446
03:10:28,100 --> 03:10:29,680
Where did my other Joy-Con go?

3447
03:10:30,120 --> 03:10:31,040
Oh, I dropped it.

3448
03:10:31,140 --> 03:10:31,440
Okay.

3449
03:10:31,480 --> 03:10:31,900
That's fine.

3450
03:10:34,400 --> 03:10:34,980
But yeah.

3451
03:10:35,320 --> 03:10:36,720
Back with our Revengeance.

3452
03:10:36,760 --> 03:10:37,100
Yeah!

3453
03:10:37,280 --> 03:10:38,760
Back with our Revengeance!

3454
03:10:40,860 --> 03:10:41,300
So...

3455
03:10:41,760 --> 03:10:42,200
Um...

3456
03:10:43,060 --> 03:10:43,500
Hmm...

3457
03:10:43,500 --> 03:10:44,160
I don't know.

3458
03:10:44,180 --> 03:10:45,160
I'm really...

3459
03:10:46,680 --> 03:10:47,200
Uh...

3460
03:10:47,200 --> 03:10:47,980
Excited.

3461
03:10:48,080 --> 03:10:48,600
Like I said.

3462
03:10:48,720 --> 03:10:49,880
I'll keep doing my best.

3463
03:10:50,400 --> 03:10:52,620
Thank you guys for allowing me back.

3464
03:10:53,840 --> 03:10:54,360
Um...

3465
03:10:56,200 --> 03:10:56,720
So...

3466
03:10:57,820 --> 03:10:58,740
Here's to you!

3467
03:10:58,900 --> 03:11:01,320
Well, it's not here's to you but here's to you!

3468
03:11:05,100 --> 03:11:05,620
Well...

3469
03:11:07,500 --> 03:11:09,340
I thought the song would start sooner.

3470
03:11:09,940 --> 03:11:10,460
Bye!

3471
03:11:25,230 --> 03:11:25,750
Bye!

3472
03:11:25,750 --> 03:11:25,910
Bye!

3473
03:11:26,090 --> 03:11:26,470
Bye!

3474
03:11:26,470 --> 03:11:26,990
Bye!

3475
03:11:26,990 --> 03:11:27,730
Bye!

3476
03:11:42,690 --> 03:11:43,650
Bye!

3477
03:11:43,650 --> 03:11:44,130
Bye!

3478
03:11:44,130 --> 03:11:50,710
This is our second song.

3479
03:11:50,810 --> 03:11:51,690
Uh...

3480
03:11:51,690 --> 03:11:52,030
Um...

3481
03:11:52,030 --> 03:11:52,310
At least...

3482
03:11:52,310 --> 03:11:53,370
It's been a long time.

3483
03:11:53,370 --> 03:11:54,010
I'm so glad this is over.

3484
03:11:54,050 --> 03:11:54,430
Okay.

3485
03:12:09,480 --> 03:12:26,740
Thank you for watching this video, I hope you enjoyed it, and I will see you in the next video.

3486
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:24,220
Thank you for watching this video, I hope you enjoyed it, and I will see you in the next video.

3487
03:13:38,360 --> 03:13:54,220
Thank you for watching this video, I hope you enjoyed it, and I will see you in the next video.

3488
03:13:54,240 --> 03:13:55,360
I

3489
03:14:18,130 --> 03:14:24,490
will dive into the fire, spilling the blood of my desire.

3490
03:14:24,910 --> 03:14:33,930
The very last time, my name scorched into the sky.

3491
03:14:35,970 --> 03:14:42,770
When heavens divide, I will see the choices within my hands.

3492
03:14:43,110 --> 03:14:46,890
How can we ever protect?

3493
03:14:47,010 --> 03:14:50,370
And fight with our tiny souls?

3494
03:14:50,910 --> 03:14:57,310
Let me shine, like the sun, through the doubts and fear.

3495
03:14:58,410 --> 03:15:05,510
Do you feel the storm approach, as the end draws near?

3496
03:15:05,970 --> 03:15:13,090
When heavens divide, time will come to softly lay me down.

3497
03:15:13,730 --> 03:15:16,710
Then I can see your face.

3498
03:15:17,010 --> 03:15:19,930
That I long to see.

3499
03:15:20,550 --> 03:15:26,850
And for you, only you, I would give anything.

3500
03:15:28,370 --> 03:15:34,450
Leaving a trace for love to find a way.

3501
03:15:58,570 --> 03:16:06,310
Leaving a trace for love to find a way.

3502
03:16:08,750 --> 03:16:12,070
When heavens divide...

3503
03:16:23,300 --> 03:16:26,130
See you guys next when I see you.

3504
03:16:26,130 --> 03:16:28,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3505
03:16:28,050 --> 03:16:29,130
See you next...

3506
03:16:37,320 --> 03:16:40,400
Thank you!
