00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,190

81
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,270

haunting here I don't pay the bills I truly think this place
was abandoned.

87
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,630
Aren't your hands tired?

88
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,110
No, my hands are like this.

89
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,630
Because I'm a ghost.

90
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,730
It's just naturally up.

91
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:41,330
Why?

92
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,570
Do you want me to put my hands down?

93
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,590
It's really cursed.

94
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:51,250
It's perhaps more cursed than if my hands are up, to be
honest.

95
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,390
Do you want to see?

96
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,750

Is this, is this, I, buh buh buh.

271
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,440

273
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,520

275
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,540
Um, I wish I could give you a more concrete answer.

my brain.

Everything that is going on behind the scenes.

279
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,340

ectoplasm leaking out my ears all the time.

Tell me all of it.

283
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:39,480

00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,940

Regularly and I plan to be streaming about Right, I wrote

304
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,920
three to four times a week.

305
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,060
It might be more.

306
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:36,040
I think I'm I Think I like streaming Back back when back
back a couple years ago.

307
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:48,800
I could only do So little because I worked at another maid
cafe at the same time so So It was much much more difficult

308
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:59,440
for me but now i'm a free ghost so i mean i am kind of i
don't know i don't know if i should be looking for another

309
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:11,440
maid cafe or not i kind of talked about it on with matara if
you listen to the if you listen to the podcast um i was like

310
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:20,100
oh my gosh maybe maybe i'll get like a job at a like a
part-time job at a grocery store or something it would it is

311
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:26,160
surprising how expensive it is to be a ghost you wouldn't
think about it but there's so many things that i have to

312
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:42,500
take care of like i just frog blinked when i there's truly
nothing going on in my head because uh ghost dollars ghost

313
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:51,440
taxes oh my gosh you just reminded me i need the my tax
person's been ghosting me why not the good kind of ghosting

314
00:28:51,440 --> 00:29:05,140

gonna write that down email hold on email tax person okay

315
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,980

316
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,100
Phantom talks Who are the patriots?

317
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:21,700
Lolli Lolleo Oh my gosh you guys Heaven Oh yes I probably
should talk about that right?

318
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:34,840
graduated three years ago Today actually Because I graduated
on 4-4 4 in Japanese And I think that's In other Asian

319
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:45,700
countries too is death it's a lucky number for me so um i
graduated on the luckiest day and um

320
00:29:50,320 --> 00:30:04,400
yeah so now i'm back on the luckiest day you graduated on
death death yep death but i went to heaven and um i don't

321
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:14,280
know i think i think i'm more suited to being a ghost i
think i had too many unresolved issues you know like being

322
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:30,900
an angel was fun and all but i just felt still this urge to
to like haunt you guys and like i don't know being a ghost

323
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:40,740
feels more up my alley busting makes you feel good no no
that's not what you're supposed to do though you know you're

324
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:59,080
supposed to you know i mean i know i covered that but like
but but um don't don't bust me okay i'm afraid no sleep i'm

325
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,160
afraid of no bed

326
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:16,380
oh let's see what else uh um so yeah i'll be streaming
somewhat regularly it might be it might turn into more but i

327
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:25,920
don't want to um with the podcast i don't want to do too
much so or like overload so oh i wrote that down why did you

328
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:36,020
come back i wrote even in heaven i felt restless like i had
some unfinished business i don't think i was ready to go so

329
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,780
maybe i'm best at being a ghost than an angel Maybe.

330
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,120
I even got my wings and everything.

331
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,240
I think they were fake, though.

332
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,180
I think they were cardboard.

333
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,180
Couldn't even fly properly.

334
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:51,840
Question.

335
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,480
Is this a re-debue?

336
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,320
Nope.

337
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,840
It's just me coming back to streaming.

338
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,760
And if I decide this to...

339
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,440
What was that?

340
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,240
do not

341
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,420
Batara don't look

342
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:33,460
oh my gosh you didn't set that no that wasn't me I think

343
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,440
funny Hold on, I'm going to keep drinking my tea.

344
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,000
Will you play Delta?

345
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,180
Oh, hell yeah.

346
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,720
I'm going to play Delta.

347
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,940
Are you kidding me?

348
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,980
Yeah, I'm going to play Delta.

349
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,920
So excited.

350
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,840
Oh, my gosh.

351
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,720
But yeah, this is just me returning to streaming.

352
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,240
If I decide to stay, then I'll make it a bigger deal.

353
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,080
Like...

354
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:14,680
new outfit or new graphics or new shiny stuff

355
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:25,130
so yeah i already have plans if that happens

356
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:49,850
yes you will have to stick around and meet too but for now
I'm gonna be mostly sticking to this outfit I if you watched

357
00:33:49,850 --> 00:34:02,170
me in the past you know that I had a original outfit at the
moment I don't plan on using it I'm sorry just like it's

358
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:19,470
really outdated and kind of embarrassing to use I think so
Matara was very generous to even get me rigged again so I'm

359
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:32,110
a little more shiny and new I actually we touch on that in
the in the next podcast episode so yeah this one is very

360
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,690
cute you like it

361
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,500
You're like...

362
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,640

363
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,780

364
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,720
I can show you guys all my faces.

365
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,320
Like...

366
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,020
Or...

367
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,140
Or...

368
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:56,850
Or...

369
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,850
But yeah...

370
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,010
Amu...

371
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,370
It's the same face.

372
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,210
No, it's not!

373
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,390
Can you do a surprise?

374
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,330

matara's stream but will say it here as well does the

377
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:48,510
podcast mean that you are joining vishojo and no does not
mean that i am joining vishojo i'm just collaborating

378
00:35:48,510 --> 00:36:01,130
collaborating with matara so i can haunt her and suck her
life force and cause her discomfort in her daily life so yes

379
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,310
that's it

380
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,350
That's it.

381
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:25,690
But, uh, Veshojo has been helping with, um, with some of the
stuff like the merchandise.

382
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,570
Hashtag save Mata.

383
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:32,270
No!

384
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,230
Me!

385
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,330
I was summoned against my will!

386
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,590
What are you talking about?

387
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,070
What are you talking about?

388
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,310
I was summoned against my will.

389
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,270
Is this model all new?

390
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,130
No, just the rigging.

391
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:55,070
I got this model just before, or this outfit, this new look.

392
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,530
Just before I...

393
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,170
Was ordered.

394
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,970
Left for heaven.

395
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:02,510
Yeah, yeah.

396
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:04,990
So, mmm.

397
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,930
But yeah, everything is so confusing.

398
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,470
People always say that I'm doing this and doing that.

399
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,350
I don't even know what I'm having for breakfast tomorrow.

400
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,910
So let's just take it.

401
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,510
Let's just take things one step at a time.

402
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,810
Another question that I wrote down.

403
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,410
Why didn't you come back sooner?

404
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,330
I don't know.

405
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,030
I don't know.

406
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,390
I probably, I guess I could have come back anytime, maybe.

407
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,170
But I honestly, I wanted to take some time to myself.

408
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,070
Person shrugging emoji.

409
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,170
Yeah, basically.

410
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,890
I wanted to take some time to myself.

411
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,210
A little productive.

412
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,570
I just came back from studying in Japan.

413
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:06,850
So I just kind of wanted to take some time away from my
usual area.

414
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,630
and clear my head and figure out what I want to do going
forward.

415
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,910
And did I do that?

416
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:13,670
No.

417
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,350
I'm even more confused.

418
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,170
I have no idea.

419
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,710
Oh, that's the next question I wrote.

420
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,910
Did you clear your head and figure out what you wanted to do
going forward?

421
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,190
No.

422
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,550
Next question.

423
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,110
Will you unprivate your old VODs?

424
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,730
This one's like a tricky one for me, right?

425
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:40,510
Because...

426
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:53,850
I'm still deciding a lot has changed from back then and I
cringe every time I see an old clip I cringe at my old mic

427
00:38:53,850 --> 00:39:07,930
quality I cringe at a lot of things a lot has changed I feel
I'm worried that like maybe if I if if people watch the old

428
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:13,910
vibes they'll be like oh she's so different than how she was
three years ago, now, you know?

429
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,630
So, I don't know.

430
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,390
I don't know.

431
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:29,690
And also, I know there's like, old, old, old, you boomers
out there.

432
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,210
I'm maybe, I'm not the boomer.

433
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,590
You guys are the boomers.

434
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:34,030
Get it?

435
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,870
I get it.

436
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:36,650
Boomer.

437
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,430
The people that I watched me before.

438
00:39:50,090 --> 00:40:01,830
and you know might want to like bring up old jokes and
things that we did things that we you know talked about and

439
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:13,090
everything but I kind of want to like just I don't know make
this a place where even newcomers can can come in and be

440
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:19,010
like, you know, can enjoy right away.

441
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,410
You know, I don't want it to be like, oh, I don't get this
joke.

442
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,290
What is she talking about?

443
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,370
Things like that.

444
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,090
I want it to be welcoming for everybody.

445
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,370
Yeah, new chapter.

446
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,370
Maybe.

447
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,690
Does that mean no Metal Gear Solid jokes?

448
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,550
What are you talking about?

449
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,110
I can't stop talking about Metal Gear.

450
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,210
Heaven had Metal Gear, you guys.

451
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,870
It was probably the best thing.

452
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,290
not the best

453
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:07,080
um well anyway it had metal gear and I am I'm sorry that I'm
sorry that I must tell you that I've come back brain rotted

454
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:17,040
welcome back to the living hey I'm not living though I'm
Definitely deceased.

455
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,560
We can tell.

456
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,700
I'm so sorry.

457
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,940
I'm so sorry.

458
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,420
Outer heaven.

459
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,140
That's literally me right now.

460
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,500
I think I am...

461
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,000
Oh my gosh.

462
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:45,880
The fan...

463
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,080
The phantom...

464
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,200
The phantom pain!

465
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,400
Have I been...

466
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,660
Have I been snake this whole time?

467
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,400
Oh my gosh.

468
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,900
It all makes sense right now.

469
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,720
It was predestined.

470
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:11,600
Truly.

471
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,080
The phantom pain.

472
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,120
Oh my gosh.

473
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,200
Let's see, what else do I have?

474
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,160
Oh, question.

475
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,200
If you decide to stay around longer, what can we expect?

476
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,200
Okay, this is kind of funny.

477
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,800
I wrote a lot.

478
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,480
More consistent schedule, comma, and then nothing else.

479
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,580
Oh boy, I'm selling it, aren't I?

480
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,420
You can expect so much from me.

481
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,840
You can expect...

482
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,400
And you can expect...

483
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,560
And you can expect...

484
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,220
And you can expect...

485
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,480
That's all I ever wanted, really?

486
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,680
Yep.

487
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,500
So...

488
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,220
I'll take your entire stock.

489
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,440
Sign me up.

490
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:21,700
Yes.

491
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:25,820
What a deal.

492
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,600
Expect redacted.

493
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,300
Something.

494
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,320
It's something big.

495
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:31,840
I can't.

496
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,380
I'm keeping you guys on your toes.

497
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,080
I can't let you in on all my secrets.

498
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,240
Hmm.

499
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,190
Why is Snake Fortnite?

500
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,350
emoting in my screen.

501
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,810
Oh, hold on, I got a cough.

502
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,020
I coughed.

503
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,560
A thousand.

504
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:16,440
What?

505
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:30,940
Thank you.

506
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,700
How are my studies going?

507
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,460
Oh, I'm done.

508
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,460
It was just a short program.

509
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:55,240
it was just a short study it wasn't well originally I wanted
it to be six months but the school could only do two and so

510
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:12,420
now I'm back I'm back home yeah so but it was good I learned
a lot yeah I learned a lot yeah what did you I study... I

511
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:12,720
study Japanese.

512
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:19,680
I study Japanese so I could talk to my idol Oshis better.

513
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,460
But a lot of it was like...

514
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,340
A lot of it was like Keigo.

515
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,780
It's just...

516
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,960
Iki.

517
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,300

The drip animation is so shiny.

532
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,720
Oh yes, I was so shocked by that.

533
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:19,940
Look.

534
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,080
My thighs are dripping.

00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,740
The chocolate is actually dripping.

536
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,360
That's...

537
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,260
Maybe my ectoplasm a little bit.

538
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,200
My...

539
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,760
Even the chocolate is possessed.

540
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,900
Even the chocolate's possessed.

541
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:44,960
Isn't that crazy?

542
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,020
Yeah, I mean.

543
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,520
Except it's not for licking.

544
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,640
It's decoration.

545
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,340
It's actually poisoned.

546
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:54,720
If you...

547
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,480
If you...

548
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,160
Lick it, you will die.

549
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,920

551
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:08,660
Okay.

552
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,300
This is how I'm feeling this whole time with so many people.

553
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,880
So many people.

554
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,580
Actually, I don't even know what the number is.

555
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,160
I don't even...

556
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,940
I'm afraid to look.

557
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,260
I'm afraid to look.

558
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,780
I don't even know how...

559
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,000
In my brain, there's only two of you guys.

560
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:30,740
There's...

561
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:31,160
Okay.

562
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:32,940
At least two.

563
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,340
Yeah, exactly.

564
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,060
Don't say it!

565
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,800
Don't say it!

566
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,560
Don't say it!

567
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,440
Don't say it!

568
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,460
Don't say the number!

569
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,600
We're just typing really fast.

570
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

571
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:50,960
Don't say it.

572
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,560
Don't say it.

573
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,480
Don't say it.

574
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:53,980
Okay.

575
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:00,670
I can blush even more.

576
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:03,390
I can blush a little bit.

577
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,190
I can blush a lot of it.

578
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:10,370
This is when...

579
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:11,580
This is when...

580
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:13,010
This is when...

581
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:15,550
This is when...

582
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,330
This is when...

583
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:21,330
This is when I'm still flustered.

584
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:22,950
Flustered, flustered.

585
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:25,730
I can't speak.

586
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,330
This is when...

587
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:30,270
...

588
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:30,950
...

589
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,030
No!

590
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:42,970
Oh no.

591
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:48,770
When you see Raiden naked, so true.

592
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:50,850
Oh my gosh, so true.

593
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,910
Hey, you guys didn't hear...

594
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:54,950
You didn't hear anything!

595
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:57,190
Okay!

596
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,900
Good, you heard nothing!

597
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:21,750
Okay.

598
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,610
Can I have a bite of my pizza?

599
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:28,990
Sorry, I forgot to eat.

600
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,350
I got...

601
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:33,390
My stomach before this was like...

602
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,650
Like, really growling at me.

603
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:42,530
I think we're comfortable enough now that...

604
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:43,670
I could eat on a street.

605
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,550
What the hell is that?

606
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,490
Who was that?

607
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:56,790
Who was...

608
00:50:58,330 --> 00:50:59,950
Who was that?

609
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,090
Oh, you can hear me chewing on that, I'm gonna mute.

610
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,570
It was the pizza delivery man.

611
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,730
Oh, it was Ryan Gosling.

612
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,090
I uh...

613
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:25,930
When I'm on the plane, I usually watch...

614
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:29,030
I usually watch one of... or actually...

615
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:31,630
I usually watched two movies for sure.

616
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:32,650
Or three.

617
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:34,530
Actually, three movies for sure.

618
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,790
The first one is Indiana Jones.

619
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,150
Some Indiana Jones movie.

620
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,490
This last time I watched The Temple of Doom.

621
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,950
And then I always watched Top Gun.

622
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,970
Usually I watch Top Gun Maverick.

623
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:54,130
I think Top Gun Maverick is my favorite movie of all time by
this point.

624
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:58,110
I have watched Top Gun Maverick so many times.

625
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:11,210

627
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:31,030

favorite scene is when Maverick, Tom Cruise, that's, that's

629
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:32,830
It's Tom Cruise, right?

630
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:42,350
Yeah, when he is showing, when he's showing the class, when
they have, when he's like, showing them that the mission is

Oh, I also...

774
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:24,080

776
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,140

01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,640
No thoughts.

01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:31,260
Nothing.

779
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,240
Nothing going on behind my brain.

780
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:42,000
And also I like combining I like this one.

781
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:45,800

Konada face.

01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,960
For real though, actually.

786
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,960
I think that's everything though.

787
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,620
Oh, can I can also?

788
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:10,900
Oh, that's not everything.

789
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:11,500
Oh my gosh.

790
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,000
But Tara hooked me up.

791
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,860

792
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:16,460

01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:16,980

01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:17,240

795
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,280

796
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:20,460

797
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:20,720

.

800
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,060
That's the best one?

801
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:42,940
You think so?

802
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,160
The gifts.

803
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:45,720
What is it?

804
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,220
It was Brian Reynolds again.

805
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,360
Oh, I can also...

806
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:54,260
I could cross my...

807
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:55,820
Whoa!

808
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:03,990
I feel like a dream works.

809
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,040
Oh my gosh.

810
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:22,780
I think that's everything.

811
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,240
And now, I think.

812
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:25,980
Maybe.

813
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:27,100
Oh, there's also...

814
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,080
Well, this is like...

815
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,640
I can...

816
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,260
I can start sweating.

817
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,120
When I'm just feeling a little bit sweaty.

818
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,360
I'm sweaty.

819
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,360
Sweaty gaming.

820
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:46,980
Sniffer.

821
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:47,620
Hey.

822
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,700
That's my ectoplasm.

823
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,080
Stop it.

824
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:53,160
How much for a mint sweat bottle?

825
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,600
You don't want it.

826
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,300
You don't want it.

827
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,120
Micro waves.

828
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:01,780

the sand burn?

832
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:48,300
Oh, the TV model, that's right, that's right.

833
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:54,460
Here, it's a little disturbing to watch me switch back and
forth, so it's kind of like body of where it feels.

834
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,720
But, uh, what was I gonna say?

835
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,720
Oh my god, curve it!

836
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:05,980

I don't even remember what I was saying.

838
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,140
I don't even remember what I was saying.

839
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,560
Oh, I was going to say, oh yes, I was saying I loved U.S.

843
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:30,380
But, uh, and I mentioned this, uh, sorry, I know I keep
saying that.

844
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,600
I said it in the podcast.

845
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:46,180

it done so quickly so um it it was it's a little incomplete

846
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:54,820

Steppie-top.

851
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:14,360
Give them your razzle-dazzle.

852
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,340
Razzle-dazzle-dazzle them.

853
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:22,680
How can they see you with sequins in their eyes?

854
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:25,320
Yep.

855
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:30,560
I look like a baby.

856
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:31,880
I'm the baby.

857
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,340
You got games on your phone?

858
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,000
Do kids still play Roblox?

859
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:43,600
What do, what do, like, what does Gen Alpha play now?

860
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:49,660

01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:50,680
Yes?

862
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,340
I have no idea.

863
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:55,800
Nobody puts baby in the corner.

864
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:04,500
You know, I only know that line from, from, uh, uh, How do I
say?

865
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:06,340
Okay.

866
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,140
I guess I'll be honest with you guys.

867
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,280
You know, in the past, I wasn't entirely honest with you
guys.

868
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,480
When I said I was going to go work at a maid cafe, I lied.

869
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,580
In fact, I only haunt this one maid cafe.

870
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,040
I was working an office job I was haunting an office.

871
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,660
I'm sorry to have lied to you.

872
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:47,480
You probably thought I was some super maid who was going
around to every maid cafe ever and being so productive and

873
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,360
awesome and like I was the best maid ever.

874
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,080
I'm a big phony.

875
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,920
I'm a big phony.

876
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,560
But that's how I know that.

877
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,340
Who was that?

878
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,680
I'm getting a bunch of strangers coming in.

879
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,900
Ah, he pays the bills.

880
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,260
Play this like a damn fiddle.

881
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:17,900
But yeah.

882
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,440
So sorry to have...

883
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,960
To have lied to you like that.

884
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,080
Oh my gosh, it's weird seeing my normal face.

885
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:39,820
So, yeah, there was a lady at one of my jobs who would
always say, Nobody puts baby in the corner.

886
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,740
I don't know what it's from.

887
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,480
It's from a movie, right?

888
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,400
It's from a movie, right?

889
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,920
But she would say it all the time.

890
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:54,380
And she would say that and she would say,
Ding-go-a-cha-baby.

891
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,240
Dirty dancing.

892
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,220
I've never seen it.

893
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,400
I'm say-so.

894
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,400
I don't dirty dance.

895
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,120
I'm dirty damn.

896
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,200
Singing time.

897
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,680
Give me a second to set up.

898
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,500
I haven't used this in a long time.

899
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,540
Oh, wait.

900
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,240
Oh, yeah.

901
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:34,700
Okay, I think we're good.

902
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:35,820
Hold on.

903
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:36,780
Uh.

904
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:42,600
I think we're good.

905
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:43,880
Oh!

906
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:45,020
We're not good!

907
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:46,560
Oh my gosh!

908
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,200
Hey, yeah!

909
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:51,740
Thanks for...

910
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:52,760
Hold on.

911
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:54,640
Before singing.

912
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:55,660
I'm an idiot.

913
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:58,440
I should have done this at the beginning of the stream.

914
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:02,900
Um...

915
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:03,640
I...

916
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,080
I, uh...

917
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,960
This is a small introduction for people that don't know who
I am.

918
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,660
A small introduction.

919
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:31,780
I made this when I actually debuted this model a long time
ago.

920
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:33,940
Um...

921
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,480
When I have my 2.0 debut.

922
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:45,060
and I didn't change anything because I don't have Photoshop
anymore I was like, oh, I don't even know what to change

923
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:57,660
everything was pretty much the same so this is me I'm
forever 19 and my birthday is also my death day which is

924
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:10,540
October 1st maybe we'll celebrate it this year maybe we'll
celebrate it this year right I'm 149 centimeters and usually

925
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:19,940
you don't ask a lady her weight but since I'm a ghost I'm 0
kilograms so it doesn't matter my special trait is my toad

926
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:32,980
impression I'm pretty good at impressions actually I'd say
skinny legend I I

927
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:43,560
What would Toad say in a situation like this?

928
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,800
Skinny legend!

929
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,720
Any frog perchance?

930
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:02,560
Oh, I can kind of do like a Kermit somewhat impression,
right?

931
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,320
Hold on.

932
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:11,160
I have to really channel it through my throat.

933
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:24,620
What does the Kermit say?

934
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,900
Welcome to the Muppets.

935
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,660
I'm going to muppet all over the place.

936
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:36,580
I can't do it.

937
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:40,500
I can't do it.

938
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:51,720
um he says hello canada he does oh maybe it's like a special
episode that i've never seen oh i don't know what you would

939
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:59,340
say hello canada like that is that how he would say it

940
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:19,940
yeah uh i have hashtags but I saw I think I don't know I
only had a general hashtag I never needed an art hashtag in

941
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:31,520
the past so maybe I don't know maybe we should keep it I
don't feel like I need more than a general hashtag and a

942
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:41,660
stream hashtag which the general hashtag is mintosinde which
is basically mint Ghost photography, ghost photos, ghost

943
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:42,200
photography.

944
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:48,680
When you're like, if you're searching like spooky ghost
photos in Japanese, it's shinde, shashin.

945
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,500
Please art tag.

946
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:55,060
Okay, maybe we can come up with one later.

947
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,180
And stream hashtag is minto live.

948
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:05,560
Maybe it should be minto dead, because I'm never alive.

949
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:06,980
I'm always dead.

950
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:13,320
You have to know.

951
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:21,050
But yeah, I mean, it's just a general hashtag.

952
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:24,990
I guess maybe hashtag Mint Phantom can be the general
hashtag.

953
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:27,290
I don't know.

954
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:29,150
Well, there's my Oshimark.

01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:03,830
I really thought that nobody...

1013
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:06,170
Well, you know, there was people that watched me, obviously.

1014
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:08,150
Back in the day.

1015
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:10,670
But I didn't think people would...

1016
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:11,570
remember me.

1017
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:17,010
So I was really surprised.

1018
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:21,230
Especially that there's so many people here.

1019
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:25,830
So I'm just gonna sing for a little bit.

1020
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:26,550
I don't know.

1021
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:27,690
I don't even know what to sing.

1022
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:28,830
Do you guys have any?

1023
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:30,710

Let's do this.

1026
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,670
Sorry, I only have this scene.

1027
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:40,670
And no.

1028
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:41,690

I have my intro.

1030
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:47,150
And this scene.

1031
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:49,570
So we're just gonna do karaoke here.

1032
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:50,350
I hope that's okay.

1033
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:55,690
But I have...

1034
01:23:58,530 --> 01:23:59,250
Uh...

1035
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:00,450
Hold on.

1036
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:02,930
Setting up a little bit.

1037
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:04,990
Get out of here, music.

1038
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:07,990

1039
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:09,670
This...

1040
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:10,230
Time.

1041
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:15,270
Uh...

1042
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:17,150
That's not audible audio, is it?

1043
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,690
I tested it before, but...

1044
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:27,650
Is it audio okay?

1045
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:30,410
Is it good?

1046
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:34,170
Okay.

1047
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:40,670
Hello?

1048
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:42,010
Why isn't this one activated?

1049
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:43,650
Oh, there we go.

1050
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:43,830
Okay.

1051
01:24:44,130 --> 01:24:45,170
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1052
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:48,830
Uh, this is, this is, uh, joy sound.

1053
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:50,670
on the switch.

1054
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:55,150
So if you're ever like, man, I wish I could do Japanese
karaoke.

1055
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:57,930
And I'm not just going to sing Japanese songs.

1056
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,530
I can sing whatever I want.

1057
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:01,230
Yippee!

1058
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:05,310
Yippee!

1059
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:09,450
So, yeah.

1060
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:15,910
If they don't have it on here, we can see if there's like a
karaoke version of it on YouTube or something.

1061
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:18,230
But, yeah.

1062
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:28,370
What should I sing, snake eater?

1063
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:30,210
You guys, I have a bat.

1064
01:25:31,470 --> 01:25:33,030
They don't have snake eater on here.

1065
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:35,490
What am I searching?

1066
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:38,270
Me.

1067
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:39,710
Me.

1068
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:40,650
Me.

1069
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:41,690
Me.

1070
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:42,810
Me.

1071
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:43,530
Me.

1072
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:45,230
Me.

1073
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:53,830
They only have two...

1074
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:55,730
I looked it up earlier because I was testing it.

1075
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:59,990
They only have two Metal Gear songs on here.

1076
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:01,330
And the first...

1077
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:04,070
I kept saying this one at karaoke in Japan.

1078
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:07,150
I have no idea what this song is.

1079
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:09,650
The Phantom Pain by White Ash.

1080
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:10,850
I looked it up.

1081
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:16,370
And I had never heard this song before.

1082
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:19,630
What is this?

1083
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,810
The Phantom Pan.

1084
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:25,490
I have no idea.

1085
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:28,670
Really good band?

1086
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:29,410
Oh, you know that.

1087
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:32,190
Japan-only song?

1088
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:32,690
Maybe.

1089
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:33,410
Maybe.

1090
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:34,670
Do they have Busted on there?

1091
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:36,010
They probably have Ghostbusters.

1092
01:26:36,570 --> 01:26:38,350
But I could sing Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday.

1093
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:41,150
But I think maybe...

1094
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:44,190
That's like... we need a better starter song, right?

1095
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:46,930
We need a better starter song.

1096
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:50,910
But you know what, let's do Ghostbusters, yeah.

1097
01:26:51,030 --> 01:27:02,530
Ghost, Ghost, Ghost, Ghost, Ghost...

1098
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:04,560
Ghost...

1099
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,680
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1100
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:08,780
Ghostbusters!

1101
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:12,300
I'm not afraid.

1102
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,360
Didn't, what's that group?

1103
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:21,840
I think they recently did a...

1104
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:23,620
A...

1105
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:26,340
What is the I'm Not Afraid version?

1106
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:29,860
What's a fallout boy?

1107
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:30,480
Huh?

1108
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:32,580
Featuring Missy Elliot?

1109
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:33,540
Huh?

1110
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:38,720
Anyway.

1111
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:41,300
Ghostbusters.

1112
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:46,740
Oh, they don't have the Ataarashi Gakko version though.

1113
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:47,220
That's okay.

1114
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:49,980
Utau!

1115
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:52,980
Do you guys like my meme?

1116
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,220
Do you guys like my meme?

1117
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:04,940
This is to get us a little warmed up.

1118
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:08,400
Oh, it's kind of loud.

1119
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,000
Oh,

1120
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,280
there's something strange in your neighborhood.

1121
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,920
Who are you gonna call?

1122
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:39,280
Mint Phantom!

1123
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:47,600
If there's something weird, then who are you gonna call Mint
Phantom?

1124
01:29:00,490 --> 01:29:01,990
Is the audio okay?

1125
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,130
Pray to know ghost?

1126
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:17,100
Things running through your head.

1127
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,340
An invisible man sleeping in your bed.

1128
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,460
Who are you gonna call?

1129
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,400
Ghostbusters!

1130
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,300
I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

1131
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:46,790
There's no ghosts!

1132
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:52,450
Oh, who are you gonna call?

1133
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:53,750
Ghostbusters!

1134
01:29:55,130 --> 01:30:02,250
If you're all alone, pick up the phone and call
Ghostbusters!

1135
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:08,270
I ain't afraid I ain't afraid to know a ghost, Garfield.

1136
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:11,470
I hear it likes the girls.

1137
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:13,570
Is that actually the lyrics?

1138
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:15,490
I ain't afraid to know a ghost.

1139
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:20,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1140
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:20,650
I

1141
01:30:28,450 --> 01:30:29,910
have ghosts, mama.

1142
01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:32,410
Freaky ghosts, baby.

1143
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:33,930
You better call.

1144
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:35,650
I don't know that part.

1145
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:41,270
I just know freaky ghosts, baby.

1146
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:43,110
Freaky ghosts, man.

1147
01:30:43,390 --> 01:30:44,150
Freaky man, baby.

1148
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:46,030
Freaky ghost band.

1149
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:49,170
I don't know the original of the song.

1150
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:51,150
Let me tell you something.

1151
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:53,390
Buster makes me feel good!

1152
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:56,050
Yeah!

1153
01:30:57,810 --> 01:31:01,110
I'm ready to know ghost.

1154
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:15,390
Oh, don't get caught alone.

1155
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:16,630
Ghostbusters!

1156
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:21,410
When it comes through your door, unless you just want some
part.

1157
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:23,790
I think you better call...

1158
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:24,170
Ghost

1159
01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:29,210
toys!

1160
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:31,750
Who are you gonna call?

1161
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:33,090
Ghostbusters!

1162
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:37,290
I think you better call Ghostbusters!

1163
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:39,290
Who are you gonna call?

1164
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:41,130
Ghostbusters!

1165
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:42,590
I can't hear you!

1166
01:31:42,850 --> 01:31:44,210
Who are you gonna call?

1167
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:58,300
Ghostbusters!

1168
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,060
Who are you gonna call?

1169
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,400
Ghostbusters.

1170
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:04,460
What's the number?

1171
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:06,860
Ghostbusters.

1172
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:09,120
No one gave me the number.

1173
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:10,300
Ghostbusters.

1174
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,080
have to Google it myself?

1175
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:14,540
Ghostbusters.

1176
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:19,860
It's not very informative though.

1177
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,560
What's the number to call them?

1178
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:29,750
Yay.

1179
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:38,850
Please check out Super Ghostbusters karaoke by Fat Bird
Karaoke for some good laughs.

1180
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:40,210
I'll check it out later.

1181
01:32:41,010 --> 01:32:41,650
Thank you.

1182
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:44,390
All right, what else can we sing, guys?

1183
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:45,690
What else can we sing?

1184
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:46,730
idol.

1185
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:50,830
I don't... I don't know... Oh, I know it.

1186
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:54,090
I know that song, obviously, but I don't know how to sing
it.

1187
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:55,550
Ike Nye Borderline?

1188
01:32:57,470 --> 01:33:01,370
You guys aren't sick of me singing Ike Nye Borderline?

1189
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:03,470
Really?

1190
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:06,770
You're not sick of me singing it?

1191
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:09,650
I sang it 50 times.

1192
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:11,930
Really?

1193
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:19,150
You want me to sing My Joy-Con is not very responsive right
now.

1194
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:25,850
We haven't seen you in three years, Mint?

1195
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:27,430
Okay, I guess that's true.

1196
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:31,570
But I sang it enough times to make up for three years.

1197
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:34,350
And then some.

1198
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:40,220
Ike and I borderline 444 times.

1199
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:41,400
Ike, what's up?

1200
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,680
Okay, this will be the real test of my throat.

1201
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:47,120
Of my voice.

1202
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:51,000
I only got my voice back like, what's today?

1203
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:51,720
Thursday?

1204
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:53,420
Got it back like Tuesday.

1205
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:53,440
So I'm more into the two-way world Ah Love, love, love,

1210
01:35:53,470 --> 01:35:55,290
Our light will be white.

1211
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:58,370
Our light is turning red.

1212
01:35:58,470 --> 01:35:59,690
It is a dangerous line.

1213
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:07,990
Ah, our freedom, our peace, our peace, we are all happy.

1214
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:13,550
we'll be happy, we'll see if we fall down, we'll die and
we'll die.

1215
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:18,590
The end of our world,

1216
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:45,650
My voice is a little

Oh, I almost spilled my tea everywhere.

1221
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:45,700
Yeah, okay.

1222
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:54,480
Emily is playing Pokemon Violet.

1223
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,100
I know what you're doing, Emily.

1224
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,520
I know you're playing Pokemon.

1225
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:05,960
Um, what else?

1226
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:08,100
Let's see, what else?

1227
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:08,800
Hmm.

1228
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,260
Oh my gosh, I can sing.

1229
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:10,820
so much.

1230
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,780
It's hard to know what to sing.

1231
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:19,740
It's been so long since I've sung that.

1232
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:22,360
I have a cover for you guys.

1233
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:23,180
Oh, Hamtaro!

1234
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:25,000
A bunch of people have been requesting Hamtaro.

1235
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:27,140
Of course I can do Hamtaro.

1236
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:32,580
Also, it doesn't have to be just this program has English
songs too.

1237
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:36,540
So, and like I said, you can request whatever.

1238
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:38,180
Hamtaro.

1239
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:40,800
Nope.

1240
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,000
You can request whatever.

1241
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:48,280
And, um...

1242
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:48,720
Yeah.

1243
01:39:51,580 --> 01:39:53,780
I'll do my best to do as many as possible.

1244
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:57,880
Without killing my throat.

1245
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,860
Without killing my throat too much, I think.

1246
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:02,980
Oh gosh, I have to be careful here, though.

1247
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:05,180
Doing the calls.

1248
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:06,600
Do you guys know Otage?

1249
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:17,410
Okay, say no!

1250
01:40:17,770 --> 01:40:18,950
MEOHOTUSKEY!

1251
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:19,330
Come

1252
01:40:24,730 --> 01:40:24,750
on!

1253
01:40:25,190 --> 01:40:31,310
HUMTARO HUMTARO HUMTARO DHHHHHUMTARO

1254
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:53,860
DASIKI HUMTARO HUMTARO Tiger, Fire, Cyber, Fiber, Tiber
Tiber, Fire DUMTARO, DUSTARO Kasha DUMTARO DASI DASIKI

1255
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:37,040
Why did the chat stop?

1256
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,280
Why did the chat stop?

1257
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:40,800
Hold on.

1258
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,380
Oh, I think YouTube froze for me.

1259
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:44,520
Am I still streaming?

1260
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:47,040
Uh-oh.

1261
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:49,060
Am I still streaming?

1262
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:54,100
I am?

1263
01:41:57,420 --> 01:41:59,240
I can only read you guys through OBS.

1264
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:01,300
YouTube completely crashed for me.

1265
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:01,860
Uh-oh.

1266
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:04,520
Not even like going to youtube.com is working.

1267
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:07,380
Oh, here we go.

1268
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:08,110
Okay, hold on.

1269
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:17,740
Uh...

1270
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:23,920
Live stream.

1271
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,440
There we go.

1272
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:29,300
There we go.

1273
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:32,700
Well, Otake was too powerful.

1274
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:33,380
Truly.

1275
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:36,920
Truly, truly, truly.

1276
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,260
Snake Eater?

1277
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:43,660
Are you sure?

1278
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:47,720
I've never, I've never, I've never sung it.

1279
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:50,540
What if I can't sing it well?

1280
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:53,120
I'm nervous.

1281
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,500
What if I can't do it justice, you guys?

1282
01:42:58,320 --> 01:42:59,360
I wonder, hold on.

1283
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,460
Snake Eater, karaoke.

1284
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:08,920
Oh, I think this one would work.

1285
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:11,760
It'll be fine.

1286
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:15,700
You say that, please sing Break Stuff by Limp Biscuit.

1287
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:19,320
I could probably do that one, too.

1288
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,420
You guys have interesting choices.

1289
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:25,140
Okay, well, this one is not...

1290
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:29,340
Obviously, the joy sound didn't have it, so I'm going to
hide that.

1291
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:31,380
Goodbye.

1292
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:33,700
Oh, gosh.

1293
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:34,520
I'm nervous!

1294
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,140
Oh, I'm nervous!

1295
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:38,960
I'm nervous!

1296
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:42,060
Let me hear this real quick, make sure it's okay.

1297
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:46,070
Oh, wow.

1298
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:48,610
It's just the original karaoke, though.

1299
01:43:51,710 --> 01:43:53,830
I wonder if I'll get copyright struck.

1300
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:09,530
This one has, like, like, 360p audio quality, 240p audio
quality.

1301
01:44:09,710 --> 01:44:11,630
So maybe that one's the safer one, even though.

1302
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,140
Okay, we can try it.

1303
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:17,880
You know what?

1304
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:19,460
I think it's okay.

1305
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:22,360
Okay.

1306
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:32,180
Oh my god.

1307
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:43,920
What a thrill with darkness and silence through the night.

1308
01:44:47,580 --> 01:45:11,340
thrill I'm searching and I'm melting to you what a fear in
my heart but you're so supreme I give my life not for honor

1309
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:46,500
There'll be no one else Oh my gosh, I'm so nervous Cry, it's
the way I fly to you I'm still in a dream Snake it up

1310
01:45:49,680 --> 01:46:08,820
Someday you go through the rain Someday you feed on a tree
frog This ordeal, the trial to survive For the day we see

1311
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:18,800
new life I give my life not for honor but for honor

1312
01:46:23,550 --> 01:46:29,090
My time, there'll be no

1313
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:51,460
one's Crime is the way I fly to you I'm still in a dream,
snake eater

1314
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,580
I'm still in a dream.

1315
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:08,640
Snake it up.

1316
01:47:11,060 --> 01:47:13,740
Snake, snake, snake, snake, snake.

1317
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,000
Snake it up.

1318
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:17,500
Oh,

1319
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:25,740
that I need a cough drop.

1320
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:32,980
Oh my god!

1321
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,220
Oh my

1322
01:47:43,890 --> 01:47:43,890
god!

1323
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:44,450
Man.

1324
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:48,850
That was so fun.

1325
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:55,510
Man, it was so fun.

1326
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:03,360
Okay.

1327
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:04,520
Okay.

1328
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,240
Sorry, you can hear a cough drop probably.

1329
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:11,660
Mm-hmm.

1330
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:12,660
Yeah.

1331
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:14,840
Uh.

1332
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:17,520
Cynthia Harold will be proud.

1333
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:20,240
I hope so.

1334
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:24,580
If I ever get to meet her, I'm gonna be like, rate me.

1335
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:26,740
No, actually, don't rate me.

1336
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:28,240
Don't, don't rate me.

1337
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:30,180
I'll cry if she'll be like, mmm.

1338
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:33,280
Cough drop ASMR.

1339
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:34,080
I'm sorry.

1340
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:34,520
I'm sorry.

1341
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:35,900
Oh, let's see.

1342
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:37,240
Let's go back to Georgetown.

1343
01:48:44,190 --> 01:48:44,730
What else?

1344
01:48:45,410 --> 01:48:46,090
What else can we sing?

1345
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:47,030
We could sing anything!

1346
01:48:48,410 --> 01:48:49,130
Practically anything!

1347
01:48:49,810 --> 01:48:50,970
The world is our oyster.

1348
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:56,750
Oh wait, um...

1349
01:49:00,350 --> 01:49:01,450
There were some requests.

1350
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:03,150
Oh, plastic loves a good one.

1351
01:49:03,650 --> 01:49:04,770
Actually, I do want to sing that one.

1352
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:05,370
I hope it's okay.

1353
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:07,610
Wait, uh...

1354
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:10,610
The con... I wonder if it'll show up in English.

1355
01:49:11,610 --> 01:49:13,930
Let's try the English first, see if it comes up in English.

1356
01:49:15,650 --> 01:49:19,830
I'm just playing games, I know that's plastic.

1357
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:20,970
Wow, was that produced?

1358
01:49:21,370 --> 01:49:23,010
101, 101 or whatever?

1359
01:49:27,410 --> 01:49:28,170
Plastic.

1360
01:49:33,950 --> 01:49:35,330
Plastic love.

1361
01:49:37,130 --> 01:49:37,330
Really?

1362
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:38,050
Nothing yet?

1363
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:39,350
Nothing yet?

1364
01:49:46,940 --> 01:49:48,140
Plastic love.

1365
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:49,680
I thought.

1366
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:52,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1367
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:57,280
Uh, juice, juice?

1368
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:58,080
What?

1369
01:49:58,320 --> 01:49:59,520
No, wait, there's a juice, juice version.

1370
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:02,620
Oh, sorry.

1371
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:05,880
I haven't been, like, writing down the set list, but...

1372
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:06,620
That was beautiful.

1373
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,480
Thank you so much!

1374
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,160

Thank you guys for all the donations.

1376
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:14,780
You guys are way too generous, for real.

1377
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:18,880
Oh, it's loud.

1378
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:29,730
I only cried a little bit.

1379
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:31,010
Me too.

1380
01:50:33,290 --> 01:50:35,550
She really cried a little bit.

1381
01:50:35,610 --> 01:50:35,990
Sorry.

1382
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:45,120
Oh,

1383
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:49,220
Matari's not a mod.

1384
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:53,800
Sorry, I'll mod you.

Oh, Harry.

I haven't even seen her.

1390
01:51:20,570 --> 01:51:21,230
Where is she?

1391
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:25,350
I haven't even seen her.

1392
01:51:25,370 --> 01:51:26,050

Oh my god.

1396

Say something.

1401
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,860
Where are you?

I'm trying to look at like we're sitting at the same time.

1403
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:15,560

Japanese hold on I don't know why you calling me so late you

01:56:51,050 --> 01:56:51,690

1440
01:56:56,010 --> 01:56:59,270
Sometimes I wish she was you.

1441
01:56:59,870 --> 01:57:03,970
I guess we never really moved on.

1442
01:57:05,630 --> 01:57:07,090
It's really good to hear you.

1443
01:57:07,110 --> 01:57:20,530
your voice saying my name is sound so sweet coming from the
lips of an angel hearing those words it makes me weak put on

1444
01:57:20,530 --> 01:57:41,390
the cry and I never want to say goodbye but girl you make it
hard to be faithful with the lips of an angel Oh, yeah, you

1445
01:57:41,390 --> 01:57:43,790

1446
01:57:44,710 --> 01:57:49,470
It's funny that you come in me tonight.

1447
01:57:52,130 --> 01:57:55,470
And yes, I've dreamt of you too.

1448
01:57:59,770 --> 01:58:02,510
And does he know you're talking to me?

1449
01:58:03,170 --> 01:58:05,270
Will it start a fight?

1450
01:58:06,770 --> 01:58:09,510
No, I don't think she has a clue.

1451
01:58:12,490 --> 01:58:17,510
Well, my girl's in the next room.

1452
01:58:18,010 --> 01:58:21,090
Sometimes I wish she was you.

1453
01:58:21,790 --> 01:58:26,270
I guess we never really moved on.

1454
01:58:27,570 --> 01:58:31,990
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name.

1455
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:47,750
It sounds so sweet coming from the lips of an angel There in
those words it makes me weak And I never wanna say goodbye

1456
01:58:48,470 --> 01:59:04,990
But girl you make it hard to be faithful With the lips of an
angel Okay, yes you need a Japanese account But you also

1457
01:59:04,990 --> 01:59:10,210
need to get a Japanese Nintendo, you need yen.

1458
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:14,790
It's like 300 yen, no, 500 yen for 24 hours.

1459
01:59:16,010 --> 01:59:22,630
So if you know a site that will like sell like Japanese
e-cars, e-sim cards, not sim cards.

1460
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:24,430
You know what I mean, Nintendo Box.

1461
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:31,570
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name.

1462
01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:33,870
It sounds so sweet.

1463
01:59:34,130 --> 01:59:50,100
Coming from the lips of an angel Hearing those words, it
makes me weak And I want to say goodbye But girl, you make

1464
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:55,120
it hard to be faithful I

1465
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:13,850
say goodbye But it's hard to be faithful The lips of an
angel

1466
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:26,820
And honey, why are you calling me so late?

1467
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:31,700
E-shop card, yes, thank you.

1468
02:00:32,580 --> 02:00:37,020
Not someone saying those Spotify ads are getting crazy.

1469
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:44,160
Man, so funny.

1470
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:50,920
There's actually a song I want to sing.

1471
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:52,620
I don't know if they have it, though.

1472
02:00:53,300 --> 02:00:59,600
Because every time I would go to karaoke to sing this song,
it'd always be some weirdo remix version.

1473
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:02,660
I wonder if they have it.

1474
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:05,540
Do you guys know?

1475
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:10,360
Actually, can you adjust the...

1476
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:11,300
Yeah, I think you can.

1477
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:14,820
Oh, they don't have it!

1478
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:15,340
Wow.

1479
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:18,400
It's not called golden, wait.

1480
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:22,940
Oh, slumbers.

1481
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:27,300
I had me sweating for a second.

1482
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:31,460
I did not read golden slumbers.

1483
02:01:35,820 --> 02:01:38,880
I like you so much.

1484
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:43,500
Thank you for being my- Oh, I wonder if they have it.

1485
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:44,700
I'll check it, I'll check.

1486
02:01:52,610 --> 02:01:56,210
Which one would it be, though?

1487
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:00,390
This one, right?

1488
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:01,370
Oh, they do have it!

1489
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:01,850
Nice!

1490
02:02:03,270 --> 02:02:03,790
Oh my gosh.

1491
02:02:04,210 --> 02:02:04,970
Great, Billy Mays.

1492
02:02:05,070 --> 02:02:05,930
Thank you for the Akadano!

1493
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:08,110
Did somebody say Nintendo Bucks?

1494
02:02:08,710 --> 02:02:12,430
Oh yeah.

1495
02:02:15,810 --> 02:02:18,110
I'll never... Actually, maybe I have sung this one before.

1496
02:02:21,150 --> 02:02:22,590
I wonder if it's the...

1497
02:02:22,610 --> 02:02:23,630
Oh,

1498
02:02:51,290 --> 02:02:53,830
my throat.

1499
02:02:55,730 --> 02:02:56,210
Oh, my throat.

1500
02:02:56,210 --> 02:03:00,190
But, you're a high-stead, and you're always going to go.

1501
02:03:01,470 --> 02:03:03,490
I'm always looking at you.

1502
02:03:04,110 --> 02:03:08,490
The final win, you're on the road.

1503
02:03:09,330 --> 02:03:09,410
I'm going to run.

1504
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:11,230
I'm going to cry.

1505
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:21,410
I

1506
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:32,800
hope this stays archived.

1507
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:34,240
Me too.

1508
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:35,900
It would be really embarrassing.

1509
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:42,920
It would be really embarrassing to come back and have my
first stream back be unarchived.

1510
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:48,180
There was something else that I thought of.

1511
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:52,100
While I was singing that, I can't remember.

1512
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:58,540
Sing sing?

1513
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:00,480
Oh, Fanta is also a good one.

1514
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,630
Okay, let me start making notes, so I don't forget me.

1515
02:06:11,900 --> 02:06:12,520
Um.

1516
02:06:14,900 --> 02:06:16,280
I'll do Fanta first.

1517
02:06:18,540 --> 02:06:19,320
Wait, wait.

1518
02:06:19,580 --> 02:06:20,680
Oh, uh, fa.

1519
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:27,680
Can it do a small...

1520
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:28,760
Oh wait.

1521
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:29,680
Fah.

1522
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:30,680
There we go.

1523
02:06:31,820 --> 02:06:32,180
Fansa.

1524
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:35,920
Crazy frog.

1525
02:06:38,820 --> 02:06:38,920
What?

1526
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:41,580
Oh my gosh.

1527
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:42,520
Wait, no way.

1528
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:44,240
There's a hololive version of it.

1529
02:06:45,620 --> 02:06:46,620
That's so cool.

1530
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:48,400
Wait, what's different about it?

1531
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:51,140
What?

1532
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:56,180
So I guess this is from the Hollow Live Honeyworks
crossover?

1533
02:06:57,460 --> 02:06:58,880
But what's different about it, I wonder?

1534
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:03,280
Let's try it.

1535
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:04,140
Let's try it.

1536
02:07:08,110 --> 02:07:08,430
Ooh.

1537
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:10,470
The hamster song.

1538
02:07:11,810 --> 02:07:19,850
Pina, pina, pina, pina, pina, pina, pina, pina, pina, pina,
pina, pina, pina, pina, pina, pina, pable.

1539
02:07:25,650 --> 02:07:27,630
Maybe the same.

1540
02:07:55,430 --> 02:07:59,830
I'll do everything, I'll do it all.

1541
02:07:59,930 --> 02:08:09,270
NG-N-S-C-N-S-D-A-T-R-I-T-Challenge
Ego-Sode-M-I-N-T-A-N-T-N-K-Me-Busage No, who's more than you

1549
02:10:28,570 --> 02:10:29,690
What's it all?

02:10:29,730 --> 02:10:30,670
What's it all?

Let's sing Together Let's move Always The words are
To-be-kiri L-O-B-E

1553
02:11:22,470 --> 02:11:29,040
I'm still eating this one cough drop.

1554
02:11:34,150 --> 02:11:35,030
Oh my god.

1555
02:11:35,770 --> 02:11:37,030
Yay, fan style.

1556
02:11:42,570 --> 02:11:45,430
Oh my gosh, that was so cute, the hollow beam.

1557
02:11:47,910 --> 02:11:49,410
Mint, are you taking a karaoke request?

1558
02:11:49,530 --> 02:11:50,170
I am.

1559
02:11:51,730 --> 02:11:52,870
Suzume by Radwims.

1560
02:11:52,990 --> 02:11:53,830
Oh, I don't know it.

1561
02:11:53,870 --> 02:11:54,750
I'm so sorry.

1562
02:11:55,870 --> 02:11:56,690
I'm so sorry.

1563
02:11:58,730 --> 02:11:59,570
It's probably on here.

1564
02:12:00,790 --> 02:12:02,010
I could do another Radwims.

1565
02:12:02,030 --> 02:12:02,350
song.

1566
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:03,970
Oh my gosh, thank you for the Akato.

1567
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:07,870
I hope you know how amazing you are, how much you need to
us.

1568
02:12:07,970 --> 02:12:10,570
No matter what you decide to do in the future, we will
support you.

1569
02:12:10,750 --> 02:12:11,530
I'll set your taxes.

1570
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:12,690
I will.

1571
02:12:13,350 --> 02:12:13,870
Thank you.

1572
02:12:14,270 --> 02:12:15,230
I don't want to do my taxes.

1573
02:12:16,210 --> 02:12:17,110
Red Knight Circulation.

1574
02:12:17,370 --> 02:12:18,930
Oh, I could do red Knight Circulation.

1575
02:12:19,670 --> 02:12:20,470
It's fast though.

1576
02:12:21,150 --> 02:12:22,810
I don't know if I can do it so quickly.

1577
02:12:23,790 --> 02:12:24,710
Hollow Live Songs.

1578
02:12:27,530 --> 02:12:29,270
I wonder what Hollow Live Songs are on here.

1579
02:12:29,370 --> 02:12:30,090
Actually, I'm curious.

1580
02:12:39,330 --> 02:12:49,070
like if we just search Hollow Live which one would it be
though the English one or the Japanese one also I am taking

1581
02:12:49,070 --> 02:12:51,510
requests so I will sing So Sen Aquarium

1582
02:13:04,150 --> 02:13:10,650
Whoa I don't think I I could sing many of them confidently
though.

1583
02:13:12,390 --> 02:13:13,430
Maybe another time.

1584
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:16,170
Next time, next time, next time, next time.

1585
02:13:16,550 --> 02:13:21,290
Like I know shiny smiley story the mostest, but I still
don't feel confident.

1586
02:13:22,010 --> 02:13:23,150
But there's a lot on here.

1587
02:13:25,830 --> 02:13:28,510
I wonder if I do the Japanese if it changes.

1588
02:13:29,550 --> 02:13:30,710
Wait, so no, hello EM?

1589
02:13:34,420 --> 02:13:35,720
Oh, wait, wait.

1590
02:13:39,970 --> 02:13:41,110
Let me try...

1591
02:13:43,570 --> 02:13:45,630
Let me try if I search like a member.

1592
02:13:47,170 --> 02:13:48,970
Oh, what did I just click?

1593
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:50,290
Oh, oopsie.

1594
02:13:50,670 --> 02:13:53,630
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

1595
02:13:54,610 --> 02:13:54,850
Kiss, kiss.

1596
02:13:55,070 --> 02:13:55,510
What advice?

1597
02:13:56,190 --> 02:13:57,310
Let's see.

1598
02:13:57,330 --> 02:13:59,110
Like, cari...

1599
02:14:01,730 --> 02:14:02,330
Cariope.

1600
02:14:08,930 --> 02:14:09,630
Oh, wait.

1601
02:14:11,990 --> 02:14:12,590
No.

1602
02:14:12,890 --> 02:14:13,510
Oh, no.

1603
02:14:13,550 --> 02:14:13,790
Oh!

1604
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:19,950
Orki...

1605
02:14:19,950 --> 02:14:20,630
Ah!

1606
02:14:21,350 --> 02:14:22,350
Wait, it would be Takanashi.

1607
02:14:23,790 --> 02:14:24,330
Ta...

1608
02:14:29,550 --> 02:14:30,090
Takanashi...

1609
02:14:30,090 --> 02:14:31,230
Oh, okay.

1610
02:14:32,850 --> 02:14:33,390
No!

1611
02:14:34,730 --> 02:14:35,670
Ah, man.

1612
02:14:36,310 --> 02:14:36,750
That's okay.

1613
02:14:38,710 --> 02:14:39,750
In English, maybe?

1614
02:14:39,950 --> 02:14:40,530
Oh, we can try.

1615
02:14:42,350 --> 02:14:43,530
I actually have a video.

1616
02:14:43,550 --> 02:14:45,070
from the last time I went to karaoke.

1617
02:14:46,710 --> 02:14:49,130
Um, Kaleiope had a message.

1618
02:14:49,990 --> 02:14:50,110
Oh!

1619
02:14:50,430 --> 02:14:50,510
Oh!

1620
02:14:51,270 --> 02:14:51,350
Oh!

1621
02:14:51,950 --> 02:14:51,950
Oh!

1622
02:14:52,190 --> 02:14:52,830
No way!

1623
02:14:54,190 --> 02:14:54,670
Oh!

1624
02:14:55,030 --> 02:14:55,650
Oh my god!

1625
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:03,140
Kaleiope is on here!

1626
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:03,840
For real!

1627
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:05,840
Oh my gosh.

1628
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:08,220
That's so awesome!

1629
02:15:08,900 --> 02:15:09,760
Wait, hold on.

1630
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:26,880
Um...

1631
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:29,440
Wait, it's right below it.

1632
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:30,720
I can't read.

1633
02:15:40,570 --> 02:15:50,870
Sometimes it's on No What if I What if I just put in Kiara
Kiara Sometimes it's more fun Going seeing what songs they

1634
02:15:50,870 --> 02:15:55,010
have on here Than actually like Singing Instead

1635
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:10,390
If I search Wait Kiara Tiara is an equal love song That's so
fun Oh my gosh Oh Wait, this is the, this is the, this is

1636
02:16:10,390 --> 02:16:14,010
the, also the Honey Works, um, the Honey Works collab.

1637
02:16:14,170 --> 02:16:14,910
That's so funny.

1638
02:16:15,410 --> 02:16:16,730
Kobo and Kiara.

1639
02:16:20,150 --> 02:16:20,710
Mmm.

1640
02:16:22,230 --> 02:16:23,670
She's on here a little bit.

1641
02:16:24,070 --> 02:16:24,570
So happy.

1642
02:16:25,710 --> 02:16:26,750
Let's go, Kiara.

1643
02:16:27,030 --> 02:16:28,090
I love you.

1644
02:16:32,590 --> 02:16:33,150
Okay.

1645
02:16:33,750 --> 02:16:34,270
Let's see.

1646
02:16:36,910 --> 02:16:37,590
Yeah, unfortunately.

1647
02:16:37,610 --> 02:16:47,230
this doesn't have like as many songs as it would in like
maybe a japanese karaoke place but it does have a ton which

1648
02:16:47,230 --> 02:16:57,950
is really exciting it's really fun so stellar stellar oh my
gosh do you want me to die i don't think i could sing

1649
02:16:57,950 --> 02:17:05,990
stellar stellar but i'm sure they have it science game

1650
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:15,440
There's so much hair!

1651
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:16,400
Wow!

1652
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:19,100
Oh my gosh, there's so...

1653
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:22,440
There's so much hair.

1654
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:23,000
Yo!

1655
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:29,260
Baka Mitae?

1656
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:31,740
I wonder if they even have it.

1657
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:34,860
Would it be in Japanese or English?

1658
02:17:36,580 --> 02:17:37,780
What is...

1659
02:17:37,780 --> 02:17:38,660
Let's try it.

1660
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:39,920
Baka Mitae?

1661
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:58,700
I don't think it was in kanji though.

1662
02:17:58,900 --> 02:17:59,880
I don't think this is right, right?

1663
02:18:01,460 --> 02:18:02,740
What is this one?

1664
02:18:04,740 --> 02:18:05,740
Does it have blue clapper?

1665
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:06,300
It did.

1666
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:07,500
They did have blue clapper.

1667
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:08,500
Love deterrence.

1668
02:18:08,660 --> 02:18:10,460
They unfortunately don't have love deterrence.

1669
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:11,260
I'm so sad.

1670
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:13,820
Uh-uh.

1671
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:16,500
Odori ka!

1672
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:20,500
That's not the right lyrics.

1673
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:22,360
No, they don't have the actual baka mitai.

1674
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:24,060
Wait, what's the lyrics for this one?

1675
02:18:24,340 --> 02:18:25,500
That's what I like about this.

1676
02:18:25,620 --> 02:18:27,640
You can kind of see what the start of the song is.

1677
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:31,840
Dang.

1678
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:35,140
Uh...

1679
02:18:35,580 --> 02:18:36,260
Odori ka?

1680
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:38,320
Odori ka.

1681
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:39,900
I like that song too.

1682
02:18:41,140 --> 02:18:42,540
You guys are requesting so many.

1683
02:18:43,020 --> 02:18:44,760
I'm not gonna be able to do all of them, I'm sorry.

1684
02:18:45,140 --> 02:18:46,660
Oh, Dorian.

1685
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:49,580
Wait, I just saw it.

1686
02:18:49,720 --> 02:18:50,700
Oh, wait, I saw it.

1687
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:52,580
Oh, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

1688
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:57,200
I think

1689
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:07,340
I have to do plus two.

1690
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:14,960
A love live song?

1691
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:15,440
Maybe.

1692
02:19:24,810 --> 02:19:26,690
This is the key I usually sing it.

1693
02:19:39,910 --> 02:19:43,190
like they do I always get the part

1694
02:20:23,900 --> 02:20:25,480
Oh my god, my throat

1695
02:20:42,650 --> 02:21:03,230
me Hey, why why why love you I never had enough but you know
only two I hang out business same love together love

1696
02:21:06,930 --> 02:21:24,250

didn't get to stop it then when I finally stood that lady

1697
02:21:24,250 --> 02:21:33,450
and I was an and if I could be someone walk with her.

1698
02:21:33,730 --> 02:21:41,850
D-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-rr-rr-rr-r.

1699
02:21:45,270 --> 02:21:48,070
My voice!

1700
02:21:48,230 --> 02:21:48,490
My

1701
02:21:55,420 --> 02:22:16,040
voice!

1702
02:22:22,850 --> 02:22:30,670
I long as they say, As a time appears, I'll always celebrate
and get to know it.

1703
02:22:31,290 --> 02:22:32,710
What happens?

1704
02:22:33,590 --> 02:22:37,830
is a love-alienly love song, what lords?

1705
02:22:37,830 --> 02:22:47,110
As a time believes it, I'll always love and love it'll
happen with love, but what we'll get to know is a

1706
02:22:47,110 --> 02:22:50,850
love-alienly love and vocals along it

1707
02:23:03,990 --> 02:23:04,470
Yay!

1708
02:23:07,110 --> 02:23:10,690
Oh gosh, for some reason, doing the doodoodoo's was killing
my throat.

1709
02:23:14,030 --> 02:23:15,850
Let me drink some more tea.

1710
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:25,660
Someone earlier requested, so say no query and I should do
that before I forget.

1711
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:31,980
So say...

1712
02:23:31,980 --> 02:23:32,820
There it is.

1713
02:23:33,460 --> 02:23:34,180
Wait, which one?

1714
02:23:34,660 --> 02:23:35,080
I'll quit.

1715
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:36,360
They're both the same.

1716
02:23:37,140 --> 02:23:37,520
Weird.

1717
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:44,880
Oh, cool.

1718
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:45,660
There's so many.

1719
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:48,460
Oh, this is like the anime.

1720
02:23:48,860 --> 02:23:49,620
And then they're...

1721
02:23:52,780 --> 02:23:53,340
Yeah.

1722
02:24:00,510 --> 02:24:01,630
Oh my gosh.

1723
02:24:01,770 --> 02:24:02,450
Simple and clean.

1724
02:24:02,670 --> 02:24:03,830
I could do it.

1725
02:24:04,690 --> 02:24:05,290
I could.

1726
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:13,820
I could.

1727
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:21,740
The world's beginning of the life, in the life of the dead,
I'm still here, I'm still here, I'm still here, a long time

1728
02:24:21,740 --> 02:24:38,800
ago, I'm here for you to hear everything, all my loved ones,
I'm here to take you to take where you're going to go and

1729
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:39,720
where are you going to go?

1730
02:24:39,960 --> 02:24:42,260
The answer is a dark,

1731
02:24:50,120 --> 02:24:52,540
Oh my gosh, I can't breathe.

1732
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:52,860
A lot of guys, I can't breathe.

1733
02:24:52,860 --> 02:24:59,380
A lot of magic wadataki, more than a lot of I'm not gonna
know my own heart.

1734
02:24:59,380 --> 02:25:00,840
My own heart, my own heart.

1735
02:25:01,780 --> 02:25:04,840
I'm born and I'm born.

1736
02:25:08,530 --> 02:25:11,660
One, two, two, three, three, four, three, four,

1737
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:39,980
I said macros, it's Aquarian.

1738
02:26:18,990 --> 02:26:23,880
What is happening?

1739
02:26:24,280 --> 02:26:24,520
What is happening?

1740
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:29,130
What is happening?

1741
02:26:34,030 --> 02:26:39,850
It's my end to 2000 years ago, 2000 years ago, I've loved
you.

1742
02:26:40,730 --> 02:26:47,050
8,000 years from now, I've more so much I've loved it.

1743
02:26:47,270 --> 02:26:52,890
It's my end to 2000 years ago, I've loved you.

1744
02:26:52,890 --> 02:27:08,370
Till I get back to you, on that day From my own self to the
end of my world, Music is continuing You always go back and

1745
02:27:08,370 --> 02:27:16,430
become an adult and become far from the far away from the
world, I'm looking at my never-never-neighbor-no- I'm always

1746
02:27:16,430 --> 02:27:22,810

twice.

1751
02:28:46,370 --> 02:28:47,250
The cough adds to it.

1752
02:28:47,350 --> 02:28:47,710
You think so?

1753
02:28:47,850 --> 02:28:49,330

Do you have a specific AKB song?

I've seen so many times.

1848
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:33,920
Oh, sorry, I just realized it's so big.

1849
02:37:37,060 --> 02:37:38,020

black.

1853
02:37:49,450 --> 02:37:51,090

Almost three hours.

1857
02:38:29,050 --> 02:38:32,830
I'm gonna probably finish up these songs that I have written
down.

1858
02:38:33,810 --> 02:38:35,210
And then I'm gonna call it, I think.

1859
02:38:35,390 --> 02:38:35,890
But that's okay.

1860
02:38:36,030 --> 02:38:39,410
It's still one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
songs.

1861
02:38:40,030 --> 02:38:40,810
It's still eight songs.

1862
02:38:40,910 --> 02:38:41,710
Oh, Lips of an Angel.

1863
02:38:41,870 --> 02:38:42,430
He is missing.

1864
02:38:42,530 --> 02:38:42,930
You're right.

1865
02:38:44,110 --> 02:38:45,250
I trusted you.

1866
02:38:56,300 --> 02:38:57,600
When did I sing that?

1867
02:39:03,940 --> 02:39:05,640
Heavens Divide Final Added.

1868
02:39:05,720 --> 02:39:06,920
Okay, that will be the last song I sing.

1869
02:39:07,500 --> 02:39:07,680
Oh.

1870
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:10,380
What happened?

1871
02:39:17,930 --> 02:39:18,270
Okay.

1872
02:39:19,050 --> 02:39:19,890
Oh, I have a list.

1873
02:39:24,300 --> 02:39:27,500
Sorry if you just heard the biggest gulp I've ever done in
my life.

1874
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:29,900
I don't think I...

1875
02:39:29,900 --> 02:39:31,940
I don't think I've chewed that properly.

1876
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:36,000
I think if I sing the song, I'm going to cry.

1877
02:39:38,120 --> 02:39:38,600
I don't know.

1878
02:39:38,700 --> 02:39:40,120
For some reason, the song makes me cry.

1879
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:41,900
But I'll do my best.

1880
02:39:42,860 --> 02:39:42,980
Oh.

1881
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:45,820
Um, wait, who's it by again?

1882
02:39:46,300 --> 02:39:47,780
Oh, there it is.

1883
02:39:47,880 --> 02:39:51,040
I hope

1884
02:39:54,140 --> 02:39:55,480
you're hydrated enough throughout the karaoke.

1885
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:56,580
I am, thank you!

1886
02:40:03,010 --> 02:40:03,230
Okay.

1887
02:40:16,700 --> 02:40:21,320
Sing, sing a song.

1888
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:24,940
Sing out loud.

1889
02:40:26,140 --> 02:40:28,160
Sing out strong.

1890
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:36,660
Sing of good things, not bad.

1891
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:42,680
Sing of happy and not sad.

1892
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:49,100
Sing, sing a song.

1893
02:40:50,360 --> 02:40:55,860
Make it simple to pass your whole life long.

1894
02:40:57,660 --> 02:41:00,920
Don't worry that it's not good enough.

1895
02:41:01,320 --> 02:41:12,600
for anyone else to hear just sing sing a song

1896
02:41:22,130 --> 02:41:38,710
sing sing a song let the world sing a love sing of love
there

1897
02:41:51,010 --> 02:42:08,590

Don't worry that it's not good enough For anyone else to

1898
02:42:08,590 --> 02:42:23,330
hear Just sing Sing a song Just sing, sing a song.

1899
02:42:23,950 --> 02:42:28,540
Just sing, sing a song.

1900
02:43:11,970 --> 02:43:20,410
I don't think, I don't think my version does justice the
version that I like to listen to.

1901
02:43:23,390 --> 02:43:23,750
Sing.

1902
02:43:24,770 --> 02:43:28,630
Actually, there's another Carpenter song that I've been
listening to a lot.

1903
02:43:29,730 --> 02:43:30,810
Wait, what's it called again?

1904
02:43:31,350 --> 02:43:32,440
Oh, shoot, hold on.

1905
02:43:34,890 --> 02:43:35,810
Um, one second.

1906
02:43:47,190 --> 02:43:48,230
Uh, yeah.

1907
02:43:49,290 --> 02:43:50,210
Carpenters are so good.

1908
02:43:50,350 --> 02:43:50,950
I know, right?

1909
02:43:54,290 --> 02:43:55,770
I've never sung this one before.

1910
02:44:03,750 --> 02:44:05,110
So it might be bad.

1911
02:44:05,410 --> 02:44:07,410
I wonder if there's Final Fantasy.

1912
02:44:07,650 --> 02:44:11,270
Oh my gosh, every time I'm just like, this is all the songs
that I sing, that I will sing.

1913
02:44:12,350 --> 02:44:13,330
I change my mind.

1914
02:44:13,510 --> 02:44:16,710
I'm just like, wait, I wonder if there's Final Fantasy songs
on here that I could sing.

1915
02:44:23,450 --> 02:44:24,930
Close to you.

1916
02:44:28,950 --> 02:44:30,150
They are like eyes on me.

1917
02:44:31,730 --> 02:44:32,830
I want to sing it.

1918
02:44:37,380 --> 02:44:38,400
Ah, let's go.

1919
02:44:40,900 --> 02:44:42,000
I've never sung this song.

1920
02:44:42,020 --> 02:44:48,840
before I'm kind of nervous why

1921
02:45:00,390 --> 02:45:27,610
do birds suddenly appear every time you are near just like
me they long to be close to you why do stars Fall down from

1922
02:45:27,610 --> 02:45:47,910
the sky Every time you walk by Just like me They long to be
Close to you My throat is giving out a little bit On the day

1923
02:45:47,910 --> 02:45:59,530
that you were born The angels got together And decided to
create a dream come true So they sprinkled moon dust in your

1924
02:45:59,530 --> 02:46:21,630
hair and golden starlight in your eyes of blue That is why
all the girls in town follow you all around Just like me

1925
02:46:21,630 --> 02:46:30,470
they long to be close to you The

1926
02:46:52,960 --> 02:47:01,840
day that you were born, the angels got together and decided
to create a dream come true.

1927
02:47:02,480 --> 02:47:10,060
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold and
starlight in your eyes of blue.

1928
02:47:12,780 --> 02:47:20,120
That is why all the girls in town follow you.

1929
02:47:20,800 --> 02:47:45,880
All around Just like me They long to be Close to you Just
like me They long to be Close to you

1930
02:47:52,910 --> 02:47:56,370
What To

02:48:51,690 --> 02:48:58,650
Oh, no, no, no, no, kiss, kiss, kiss Oh, I wanted to also
sing maybe some Dempagumi.

1935
02:49:00,290 --> 02:49:01,610
There's too many songs I want to sing.

1936
02:49:03,710 --> 02:49:06,130
Wait, since I can't do a dot, maybe just the EXE.

1937
02:49:08,150 --> 02:49:08,810
No, no.

1938
02:49:08,950 --> 02:49:09,630
Okay, space.

1939
02:49:11,070 --> 02:49:11,470
E.

02:49:13,350 --> 02:49:13,750

1941
02:49:15,550 --> 02:49:15,950
No!

1942
02:49:18,290 --> 02:49:18,990
Okay, hold on.

1943
02:49:19,090 --> 02:49:20,270
Let me search Momo and Haruko.

1944
02:49:20,470 --> 02:49:21,330
Let's see what they have.

1945
02:49:26,270 --> 02:49:29,070
I'm a 10-hour stream for real though.

1946
02:49:30,950 --> 02:49:33,010
No, I'm not going to keep you guys so long.

1947
02:49:33,250 --> 02:49:33,590
Don't worry.

1948
02:49:36,190 --> 02:49:36,390
Do.

1949
02:49:48,120 --> 02:49:51,480
They do have under-17, which is another...

1950
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:52,620
Pop-o-ton!

1951
02:49:53,700 --> 02:49:57,660
I wasn't going to sing Pop-o-ton, but I was thinking of
another under-17 song.

1952
02:50:02,380 --> 02:50:03,640
Wait, is this mouse?

1953
02:50:04,080 --> 02:50:05,080
Chew, mouse.

1954
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:10,620
Oh, no, there's mouse.

1955
02:50:11,180 --> 02:50:11,560
Chew, mouse.

1956
02:50:11,660 --> 02:50:12,820
Wait, they do have I Know Medicine.

1957
02:50:12,920 --> 02:50:14,480
That's the one I was going to sing, not Popatan.

1958
02:50:16,980 --> 02:50:18,480
Ah, they do have it.

1959
02:50:19,140 --> 02:50:21,400
I just had to search Baldur Force instead.

1960
02:50:23,960 --> 02:50:24,340
Okay.

1961
02:50:31,700 --> 02:50:32,820
I'll have to do it.

1962
02:50:32,840 --> 02:50:36,760
Yeah, I'll have to do a dedicated karaoke stream sometime.

1963
02:50:48,140 --> 02:50:49,540
Okay,

1964
02:51:27,440 --> 02:51:27,440
sorry.

1965
02:51:30,780 --> 02:51:32,540
Okay, let me have you.

1966
02:52:33,260 --> 02:52:43,680
I pray among the stars I pray among the stars

1967
02:53:06,420 --> 02:53:24,920
Oh, it's all you call it right away, be a moment.

1968
02:53:29,200 --> 02:53:32,060
Oh my gosh, kanji sometimes.

1969

1975
02:54:41,820 --> 02:54:43,200
That's what you do with your art moments.

1976
02:54:43,320 --> 02:54:44,560
You kind of like making eggs.

1977
02:55:57,160 --> 02:55:57,960
Hey drink!

1978
02:56:03,430 --> 02:56:09,390
I'm having so much fun though Even though my throat is
starting to get worse and worse, I don't want to stop

1979
02:56:13,050 --> 02:56:15,550
Actually, since I did that one, no, I lied.

1980
02:56:15,830 --> 02:56:16,990
I am going to do that one.

1981
02:56:17,690 --> 02:56:20,530
I said I was like, maybe I'll only do one Momoi Haruko song.

1982
02:56:21,090 --> 02:56:21,350
No.

1983
02:56:21,970 --> 02:56:22,910
I want to do two.

1984
02:56:24,550 --> 02:56:26,630

02:56:39,800 --> 02:56:41,220
The list gets longer.

1986
02:56:41,420 --> 02:56:42,640
It dies.

1987
02:56:43,960 --> 02:56:45,700

03:06:43,640 --> 03:06:43,940
Oh, that.

2048
03:06:47,040 --> 03:06:48,280

Um, sorry.

2051
03:07:13,330 --> 03:07:14,790
Someone suggested Diamond Crevice.

2052
03:07:14,970 --> 03:07:16,690
I really want to sing it, but I don't think I'll be able to.

2053
03:07:18,570 --> 03:07:19,510
Or break stuff.

2054
03:07:19,590 --> 03:07:20,270
Or la-la-lan.

2055
03:07:20,830 --> 03:07:21,870
Or simply clean.

2056
03:07:22,330 --> 03:07:24,330
But I'll just have to do another karaoke sometime.

2057
03:07:24,870 --> 03:07:25,350
Right?

2058
03:07:37,030 --> 03:07:38,870
Let me check if this is good.

03:07:41,190 --> 03:07:41,870
One second.

2060
03:07:43,990 --> 03:07:44,730
One second.

2061
03:07:46,190 --> 03:07:46,830
One second.

2062
03:07:51,640 --> 03:07:52,060
Okay.

03:08:00,770 --> 03:08:01,710
Last song, everybody.

2066
03:08:02,890 --> 03:08:04,890

03:08:42,170 --> 03:08:44,010
Look at that, the cough drops helped so much.

2072
03:08:44,370 --> 03:08:45,710
Maybe I can do diamond crevice.

2073
03:08:48,690 --> 03:08:50,210
No, I shouldn't, I shouldn't.

2074

I'm doing next week.

2085
03:09:46,490 --> 03:09:48,770
I don't know when the next stream is even.

2086
03:09:50,350 --> 03:09:51,370
I don't know anything.

2087
03:09:53,450 --> 03:09:56,290
So I hope that you guys will be a little patient with me.

2088
03:09:56,410 --> 03:09:58,290
I kind of just really jumped back in.

2089
03:09:58,370 --> 03:09:59,150
I was just like, you know what?

03:09:59,330 --> 03:10:00,910

2091
03:10:01,190 --> 03:10:03,510

Thank you guys for allowing me back.

2100
03:10:55,790 --> 03:10:58,890
So, here's to you.

2101
03:10:59,110 --> 03:11:01,690
Well, it's not here's to you, but here's to you.

2102
03:11:04,530 --> 03:11:09,590
Well, well, I thought the song would start sooner.

2103
03:11:25,220 --> 03:11:32,200
Petals of white cover fields flowing in grieving tears.

2104
03:11:33,060 --> 03:11:39,700
And all the hearts once new, old and shattered now.

2105
03:11:40,380 --> 03:11:42,140
Love can kill.

2106
03:11:42,660 --> 03:11:46,680
Love will die, give me wings to fly.

2107
03:11:47,220 --> 03:11:55,220
Bleeding this world so cold, I just wonder why.

2108
03:11:59,050 --> 03:12:05,650
Cold as the dark, now my words are frosted with every
breath.

2109
03:12:06,750 --> 03:12:13,590
Still the hate burns wild, growing inside this heart.

2110
03:12:14,050 --> 03:12:29,970
When the wind changes course, when the stars light, I will
reach out to you and leave this all behind but heaven's

2111
03:12:29,970 --> 03:13:16,510
divine I will see the choices within my hands how can we
ever protect and fight with our tiny souls let me shine like

2112
03:13:16,510 --> 03:13:31,690
the sun Through the doubts and fear Do you feel the storm
approach As the end draws near With heaven's divide Time

2113
03:13:31,690 --> 03:13:52,530
will come to softly lay me down Then I can see a face That I
long to see And for you I would give anything Leaving a

2114
03:13:52,530 --> 03:13:55,110
trace for love

2115
03:14:17,890 --> 03:14:36,670
I will dive into the fire Spilling the blood of my desire
The very last time My name scorched into The sky When

2116
03:14:36,670 --> 03:14:51,190
heavens divide The choices within my hands How can we ever
protect and fight with our tiny souls?

2117
03:14:51,950 --> 03:15:05,850
Let me shine like the sun Through the doubts and fear Do you
feel the storm approach as the end draws near?

2118
03:15:06,290 --> 03:15:24,210
When heaven say bye, time will come To softly lay me down
Then I can see a face That I long to see And for you Only

2119
03:15:24,210 --> 03:15:34,290
you I would give anything Leaving a trace for love To find

2120
03:15:58,410 --> 03:16:15,470
out Leaving a trace for love Find a way When heavens Divide
