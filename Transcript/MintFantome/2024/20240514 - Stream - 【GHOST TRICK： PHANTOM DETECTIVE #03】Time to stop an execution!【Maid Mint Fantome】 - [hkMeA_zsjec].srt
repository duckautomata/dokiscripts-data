1
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,740
Why does it seem so quiet?

2
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,040
I don't know why the music seems so different than before.

3
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Welcome back!

4
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,720
Ladies and gentlemen!

5
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,720
Hello everybody!

6
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,740
I'm Mint!

7
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,460
Welcome!

8
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,120
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello!

9
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,260
Minty fresh being a member again!

10
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,020
Thank you!

11
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,200
Thank you guys!

12
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

13
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,240
Hello, hello, hello!

14
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,720
Good morning, Minta!

15
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,900
Good morning!

16
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,900
Hello, hello.

17
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,480
Why is it so low?

18
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,300
If I turn it up... I don't remember it being that high.

19
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,040
I don't know.

20
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,060
I have no idea.

21
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,940
I didn't adjust the music.

22
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,920
Weird.

23
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,620
Anyway.

24
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,180
Thank you, thank you!

25
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,840
Thank you!

26
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,760
Oh, they're real.

27
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,660
Sharing my birthday cash!

28
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,160
Please don't sing for me, though.

29
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,060
It'll embarrass me.

30
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,780
I wouldn't embarrass you, Slice Saber.

31
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,760
Happy birthday to you!

32
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
Happy birthday to you!

33
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,200
Happy birthday, dear Slice Saber!

34
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,720
That's you!

35
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,060
Slice Saber!

36
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,540
Happy birthday!

37
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,740
Happy birthday to you!

38
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,290
One more

39
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,690
time!

40
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,470
How old are you now?

41
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,270
Slice Saber, how old are you now?

42
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,910
How old are you now?

43
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,160
How old are you now?

44
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,160
You're not embarrassed, right?

45
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,500
Oh, yeah!

46
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,220
One more time!

47
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,500
You're almost a ghost.

48
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,960
You're almost a ghost.

49
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,680
You're almost like Minta.

50
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,840
You're almost a ghost.

51
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,680
Yeah!

52
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,680
Um...

53
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,900
Die without regrets.

54
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,580
Or you'll be a ghost.

55
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,060
Die without regrets.

56
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,820
Or you'll be a ghost.

57
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,120
Asking for the three digits.

58
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,180
What's your credit card number?

59
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,220
And the three digits on the back.

60
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,500
What's your credit card number?

61
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,980
Plus the three digits on the back.

62
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,500
And don't forget the zip code.

63
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,880
Plus

64
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,360
the three digits on the back.

65
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,300
Where did you go to school?

66
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,300
And your first pet's name?

67
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,140
And what was your childhood...

68
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,680
Uh...

69
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,620
Childhood...

70
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,980
Sweetheart?

71
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,500
And your mother's maiden name?

72
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,440
And your mother's maiden name?

73
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,360
What?

74
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,880
You must've been born with a dress without nee,

75
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,700
IU's date and birth date.

76
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,600
You must've been born with a dress without nee, IU's date and birth date.

77
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,900
And you're like a ghost!

78
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,340
You probably wasn't able to remember.

79
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:33,380
But you are just weird.

80
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,700
So, let's go back!

81
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,260
Now, I have to run!

82
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,160
And now apologies for my bad speaking skills.

83
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:45,580
Anyway...

84
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,240
It's Slice Saber's birthday and everyone is singing to him.

85
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,880
They're turning 37.

86
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,180
No way.

87
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,860
Oh my gosh.

88
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,540
Peng, you just...

89
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,020
Happy birthday.

90
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,980
Don't get me anymore.

91
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,640
Damn, I'm only 34.

92
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,400
Well, soon you can come back and watch this in 3 years and it will be accurate.

93
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,840
Namae, oh, she's trying to commit credit card fraud and going on a main cafe spree.

94
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,100
I would never.

95
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
I would never.

96
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,120
I would never.

97
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,700
Anyways, you guys, welcome back to Ghost Trick.

98
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,200
This is our third time playing, baby.

99
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,200
And last time we ended, it was so crazy.

100
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:49,300
Someone stole my credit card info, so I had to cancel the card I used to pay for membership in YouTube trying to charge me for 8 times in one day.

101
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,100
Was it... did YouTube steal your card?

102
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,760
Oh my gosh.

103
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,160
That's crazy.

104
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,620
I'm so sorry.

105
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,320
I've had my... I've had my card stolen only once.

106
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,140
And I... I know... I knew that it was stolen.

107
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,580
Because I went to...

108
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:19,260
I went to get some breakfast before work.

109
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
And my card declined.

110
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,160
And I checked my bank account.

111
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,400
And I was negative.

112
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,300
And I was like, that shouldn't have happened.

113
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,860
And they... they had...

114
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,940
The person had ordered like a bajillion pizzas.

115
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,120
So... yeah.

116
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,980
It was not great.

117
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,660
But you know...

118
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,440
Luckily, it only happened once.

119
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,800
Was it... was it Matara?

120
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,100
I wouldn't... I wouldn't let her get away with it.

121
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,300
You know?

122
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,320
Man, the best party ever.

123
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,680
Yeah, on my dime.

124
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,960
But honestly, I say a bajillion.

125
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,460
But like, he couldn't even order that many pizzas.

126
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,420
Because I did not have that much in my bank account.

127
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,660
Why are you stealing from some poor ghost like me?

128
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,400
Huh?

129
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,580
Thank you, thank you.

130
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,320
Kiss.

131
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,340
Kiss.

132
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,500
Stolen money is the best money.

133
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,720
I don't know about that.

134
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,180
Pizza party fun.

135
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,240
Yippee!

136
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,500
Spent all my money on seven pizzas.

137
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,540
Mine got stolen once and they spent 700 bucks on an office depot.

138
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,700
What are they buying?

139
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,880
Maybe they thought that you were like loaning them money to start their business.

140
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,580
You know what I mean?

141
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,020
It was a small loan, right?

142
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay.

143
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,520
Okay.

144
00:10:59,620 --> 00:10:59,840
Okay.

145
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,240
Okay.

146
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,620
No more talking about stolen credit cards.

147
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,420
No more credit card business talk.

148
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,400
Okay.

149
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,220
We're gonna talk about ghosts and tricks.

150
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,220
I just had my card denied while shopping out of town because of suspicious purchases.

151
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,840
But someone used my card in California to buy guns and somehow that was approved.

152
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,240
Oh my gosh, wait.

153
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,240
That was, that has happened to me.

154
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,100
Because, because when my card was stolen, it was a different state.

155
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,160
But I have gone to other places before and had my card declined because they thought it was suspicious.

156
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,920
So weird.

157
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,060
But it's the story time.

158
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:58,180
We left off on a cliffhanger last time we played where we discovered the guy that Lin was been trying to get in contact at the police station.

159
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,560
And it's a special police station of people with special crimes.

160
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:13,940
And the guy that Lin is wanting to help is getting executed tonight in like an hour or something.

161
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,420
So we have to like, we have to kind of skedaddle.

162
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,660
Hopefully the audio will be okay.

163
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,800
If not, if it's too quiet during, I can adjust it as well.

164
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,480
So just let me know.

165
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,900
And I will.

166
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,300
Oh, five minutes.

167
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,400
Wasn't it five?

168
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,740
It was.

169
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,340
Actually, I think you guys are right.

170
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:32,700
It was.

171
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,020
I'm being kind of gracious.

172
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,720
It was five minutes.

173
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,300
Costco pizza slice supply drop.

174
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:44,780
Yummy.

175
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,490
Five minutes until he fries.

176
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,110
He's turning.

177
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,690
Getting being turned into fries.

178
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,650
I'm a soup.

179
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,130
Casual breed.

180
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:00,990
Thanks for one month.

181
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,750
Thank you.

182
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,130
Thank you guys for returning all the members returning.

183
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,090
Thank you so much.

184
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,770
Really, really appreciate it.

185
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,570
Can't believe it's been a month.

186
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,790
Oh my gosh.

187
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,550
Well, not a month since I've been back.

188
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,610
I guess a little over a month that I've since I've been back.

189
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,330
Yeah.

190
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,350
I kind of wanted to do something a little bit special.

191
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,890
So I decided to do the English karaoke on Wednesday.

192
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,610
So it's not much, but I have been cooking.

193
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,930
I have been cooking a lot of stuff.

194
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:33,670
Oh, my gosh.

195
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:48,170
Like, well, actually, most of everything that I've been cooking has been for my anniversary, which will be in July, which I'm like, oh, my God.

196
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:48,550
Can I?

197
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,990
Is it okay if I say that it's my four year anniversary?

198
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,710
Because technically, I didn't even get to celebrate my first year anniversary.

199
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:58,830
What?

200
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,910
But it would be kind of cool to say that it's a four year anniversary.

201
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,630
Because four is a spooky number.

202
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,230
Technically, we never even got to celebrate one anniversary.

203
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,690
So we will celebrate.

204
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,490
And I have some fun things that I'm planning for the anniversary.

205
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,010
I was like, oh, my gosh, I got to start working on stuff now.

206
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:27,970
Honestly.

207
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,890
I was like, sheesh.

208
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,430
One in four.

209
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,990
Actually, I was kind of like thinking of doing like that.

210
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:44,490
But I was like, if I do like one zero or not zero, one like one slash four or one in four, people might get confused.

211
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,530
I don't know.

212
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,190
Hey, I'm Minto.

213
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,090
Hope your day is good.

214
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,070
Work was pretty crazy.

215
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,530
But I'm getting hyped for this gym session with my Kamiyoshi is the perfect voice for it.

216
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,370
Yeah, let's go.

217
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,850
Gym time.

218
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,310
Then four in one.

219
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,310
Oh, yeah.

220
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,730
V has come too.

221
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,490
But wouldn't it be one V?

222
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,670
One V has come one.

223
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,630
Timer pause when you went to heaven.

224
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,750
Them's the rules.

225
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,110
You're basically a newer streamer.

226
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,070
No.

227
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:27,830
Oh, no.

228
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,610
Let's do all four anniversaries.

229
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:33,510
Yeah.

230
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,410
Four is one.

231
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,330
V is two.

232
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,130
Okay.

233
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,070
So next year I can say V has come too.

234
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:47,610
Yeah.

235
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,710
But anyway.

236
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,410
I'm still figuring it out.

237
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,750
We'll figure it out.

238
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,770
That joke is going to be so funny next year.

239
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,310
Back to you.

240
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:01,930
Back to V-ing.

241
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,170
Okay.

242
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,110
Let's not waste any more time.

243
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,470
Sorry.

244
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,730
I was like so busy though.

245
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,030
Because I was like, okay, I'm wasting more time.

246
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:23,910
Because like, oh my gosh, I woke up this morning and I was, I was emailing so many people and I was, I was, I was, I was doing phone calls.

247
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:30,510
I have phone calls and during the phone calls, I was, I mean, this is like not stuff that you'll ever see.

248
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,310
It was stuff that I know.

249
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,030
It was stuff that I needed to get done.

250
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:38,850
But during phone calls and meetings, I was, I was also messaging people about other stuff.

251
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,610
Oh, I was so busy this morning.

252
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,470
We will always be here for you.

253
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,130
You nerd.

254
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,310
Fun for days.

255
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:45,910
Miss V-ing.

256
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,770
Thank you, Josh.

257
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,230
Thank you, Josh.

258
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,130
I love for the pink.

259
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:49,910
Thank you.

260
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:51,890
Yeah.

261
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:57,990
But I was like, I was really, I've been really like kind of kicking butt to get stuff done.

262
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,290
And like, um, one thing.

263
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:06,510
I was, I've been in charge of is getting all the artwork for the Patreon for the postcards.

264
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:21,430
And so, um, it's been a lot of like back and forth between so many different artists and like they'll send something and I'll be like, and then I'll like respond and set or sent to Matara and be like, do you want any changes and this and that?

265
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,370
And like, I'm talking to like six different artists at once.

266
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,890
So I'm like, wow.

267
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,450
And then I'm also ordering the postcards.

268
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:38,870
And I'm also like, oh, and I'm also, uh, I'm having a busy weekend this weekend, which is why I'm having to take off a couple days.

269
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,070
And so I'm just like, wow, I gotta get ready for that.

270
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,230
I gotta get to do this.

271
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,370
I gotta record the podcast.

272
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,910
I gotta email this person back.

273
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:54,410
And like people are emailing me for like events and conventions and stuff.

274
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,830
So I'm just like, okay.

275
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,430
Or like other things that seem kind of cool.

276
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,270
So I'm just like, wow, I gotta email this person back.

277
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:08,050
So there's like been so much going on behind the scenes that I like wish I could share more of.

278
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:15,350
But I have been trying to work hard to do lots of stuff.

279
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,650
It's a lot to deal with.

280
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,910
Yeah, but it's so much fun.

281
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,930
It's actually so much fun.

282
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,990
I think if I, well actually not that I think.

283
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,590
The day, whenever I decide to not be a streamer anymore.

284
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,150
One thing that I really love is just like general planning.

285
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:40,370
And like I would love to like, I don't know.

286
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,750
Like maybe one day be like a manager to like a Vtuber or something.

287
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,490
Project manager mint.

288
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,250
Yeah.

289
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,390
It's fun.

290
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,770
I used to plan a bunch of stuff.

291
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,970
Even before Vtubers.

292
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,290
Vtubing.

293
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,530
And even as a Vtuber, I love planning stuff.

294
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,070
So, but trying to plan things and also...

295
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,130
Yeah.

296
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,530
Starting your own Vtuber company with gacha and idols.

297
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,550
How many directions did you plan things in?

298
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,590
What do you mean?

299
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:27,970
Um...

300
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:35,030
Hey, I helped with planning some stuff at like conventions.

301
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,490
It's probably the easiest way to say it.

302
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,030
So...

303
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,890
I got that reference.

304
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,890
Happy one month Ms. Fartome.

305
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,770
Thank you.

306
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,230
Poppy!

307
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,410
Thanks for the pink!

308
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,070
I couldn't make it for the last two streams.

309
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,710
But I'm so glad I can finally watch my fav streamer...

310
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,530
My fav Vtuber stream my fav game live.

311
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,770
Hope you enjoy the ride mint.

312
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,270
Thank you!

313
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,330
Thanks for the pink!

314
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,370
It's a much cooler ambition than working in a grocery store.

315
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:10,570
Hey.

316
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,530
Look, I didn't know.

317
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,750
I didn't know!

318
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:16,690
Bye.

319
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,370
Um...

320
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,830
What was I gonna say?

321
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,590
Oh!

322
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,070
Oh my gosh, you guys.

323
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,290
Yesterday...

324
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,430
I saw my grandma...

325
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,270
And my mom...

326
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,610
For Mother's Day.

327
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,870
And um...

328
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,690
Sorry, we'll get to the game eventually.

329
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,530
Holy cow.

330
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,950
But um...

331
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,990
I gifted my mom...

332
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,890
Um...

333
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:43,450
Uh...

334
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,590
This thing.

335
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,310
Let me see if I can get it.

336
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,550
Let me see if I can get a picture...

337
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,130
Say what it is.

338
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,710
Hold on.

339
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,210
Uh...

340
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:52,470
Uh...

341
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,540
Okay.

342
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,160
Oh, I have to do this too.

343
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,760
Oh my gosh.

344
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:00,900
Okay.

345
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,680
Um...

346
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,640
So my mom is really into like meditating and relaxing and stuff like that.

347
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,280
And I found this thing.

348
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,520
And I got it on sale.

349
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,080
Thank God.

350
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,960
Because it was really expensive.

351
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,620
But it's called...

352
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,680
This...

353
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,480
It's called...

354
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,620
The Drift.

355
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,260
And it's like...

356
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,820
It's like...

357
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,580
It's like a...

358
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,240
You know those...

359
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,160
Those zen gardens?

360
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,300
Where you like draw like...

361
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,020
Draw in the sand?

362
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,160
It's like one of those.

363
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,100
But it's...

364
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,240
But it's...

365
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,620
It's a...

366
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,440
It's...

367
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,060
You put a metal ball on it.

368
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,760
And it...

369
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,140
Kansai Drift.

370
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,600
Oh.

371
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,040
Yeah.

372
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,660
And like...

373
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,700
And then you...

374
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,500
You...

375
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,580
You put...

376
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,980
You get an app and you...

377
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,800
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

378
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,340
And then it draws a design on the sand for you.

379
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,780
And it's like...

380
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,500
Oh my gosh.

381
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,500
At one point, we were all just standing there.

382
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,540
In silence like staring at it.

383
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,880
And just like in silence.

384
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:05,320
We were all like watching it draw in the sand.

385
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,360
And I had to leave before my grandma.

386
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,700
Because my grandma went to sleep.

387
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,100
I had to leave before she got to see it.

388
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,800
But then my mom texted me a picture of my grandma.

389
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,540
And she was just...

390
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,320
Let me see.

391
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:20,880
She...

392
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,480
She sent me a picture of my grandma just staring at it.

393
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,460
She said, Thank you so much for the gift you bought me.

394
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,060
Grandma and I are sitting here in the quiet, just mesmerized by it.

395
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,020
It's a picture of my grandma just staring at this thing.

396
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,540
Like so...

397
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,440
Locked on.

398
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,860
It's so funny too because my grandma likes to wear headbands.

399
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,680
She always has, even when I was like a young ghost.

400
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:04,780
And the headband she was wearing this time was a black headband.

401
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It was like around her head.

402
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,260
And I was like, Grandma, you got infinite ammo.

403
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,120
But she wouldn't stop talking about...

404
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,500
She wouldn't stop talking.

405
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,620
She would be like, She would be like...

406
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,020
My grandma is at an old person's home, right?

407
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,020
But she loves...

408
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,540
Usually I feel like old people don't like the old people's home.

409
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,360
But my grandma is obsessed with this old person's home.

410
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,140
She loves the old people's home.

411
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,560
She's like...

412
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,340
She's like, Don't ever take me out.

413
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,360
And we're like, We're not.

414
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,560
My mom is just like, Yup.

415
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,420
Because my grandma will be like...

416
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,040
She's like, I go up and down those halls.

417
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,860
And I keep everybody in check.

418
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,740
Yesterday she was just like, I...

419
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,880
You know, recently fights have been breaking out with the old people.

420
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,420
And with the doctors.

421
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,120
And she...

422
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,780
She just like always calls it one flew over the cuckoo's nest.

423
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,220
Every time I see her she's like, Have you seen one flew over the cuckoo's nest?

424
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,540
That's this place.

425
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,220
And I'm in charge.

426
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,380
And I'm like, Yeah, I know grandma.

427
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,080
Elderly uprising.

428
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,220
Well, she was just like, There was a fight that broke out.

429
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,000
And...

430
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,640
There was a fight that broke out.

431
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,500
And I went in there.

432
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,540
I went in there.

433
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,400
And I said, Hey, you fuckers cut it out.

434
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,140
Because I need that doctor.

435
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,420
Because I have to shit.

436
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,860
My grandma.

437
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,150
What do you mean?

438
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,870
What do you mean by that?

439
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,790
Grandma, mint is living the dream.

440
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,490
It's true.

441
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,750
My grandma man.

442
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,410
My grandma.

443
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,870
She said that she...

444
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,530
Oh, my grandma.

445
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,250
I'm trying to think of what else she's...

446
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,090
So, she kept talking...

447
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:14,750
She's like...

448
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:20,770
The whole time I was driving with her, she wouldn't stop talking about her explosive diarrhea.

449
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,650
I don't think I should share that with you guys so much.

450
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,270
Is your grandma a big boss or something?

451
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,170
My grandma doesn't hold back about anything.

452
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,710
Yeah, let's not share it.

453
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,330
Is your grandma Johnny?

454
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,130
Oh grandma...

455
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,490
Okay, shall we play the game?

456
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,930
Sorry, I just thought of that because I was just like...

457
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,610
I kind of want to get the thing now for me too.

458
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:06,990
So I can sit in the dark or sit in silence just mesmerized by this little ball drawing in the sand.

459
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,610
It's really mesmerizing though.

460
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,350
But they're really expensive.

461
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,010
I bought it because...

462
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,850
It was a combined like...

463
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,950
Mother's gay...

464
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,590
Mother's...

465
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,730
Mother's Day...

466
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,150
Birthday...

467
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,310
Did I say Mother's gay?

468
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,520
Your mom's what?

469
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:44,460
It was a Mother's Day birthday gift.

470
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,740
Okay...

471
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,560
Let's continue the game.

472
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,000
We're playing the game now.

473
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,300
Oh my goodness.

474
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,260
Okay, we have five minutes until a person is dead you guys.

475
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,420
We can't be laughing.

476
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,400
We can't be...

477
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,020
Search gay...

478
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,220
What is wrong with me?

479
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,700
First search gay and now Mother's gay.

480
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,260
You really can't talk your way...

481
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,040
Okay, no I can talk my way out of it because...

482
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,580
I combined day with gift, okay?

483
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,800
This is actually how my brain works.

484
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,900
Everything just is like...

485
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,440
You take all the words of a sentence and you go...

486
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,200
You go...

487
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,880
You take all the words and then you go...

488
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,020
And you smash it all together.

489
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,880
Okay?

490
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,220
Mother's gay?

491
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,280
Yeah, they are.

492
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,020
Both of them.

493
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,880
How do you know?

494
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:51,960
Hahaha...

495
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,400
Hahaha...

496
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,140
I don't...

497
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,840
The other day...

498
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,080
The other day I was...

499
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,300
This is...

500
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,580
What did I type?

501
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,040
Hold on.

502
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,360
I was messaging someone...

503
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,220
And...

504
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,360
And...

505
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,760
I was messaging someone...

506
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,600
And they were like...

507
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,560
Do you have a deadline when you want this finished?

508
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,160
And I was like...

509
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,180
Whenever you have fun...

510
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,640
Because...

511
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,060
In my brain...

512
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,520
I typed have...

513
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,900
And so my brain just said...

514
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,660
Have fun!

515
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,240
So...

516
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,880
But I meant have time...

517
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,140
And I was like...

518
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,260
No!

519
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,180
Not fun time!

520
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,560
Don't have fun!

521
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,840
My brain is so weird...

522
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,220
Hahaha...

523
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,220
Hahaha...

524
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,640
Hahaha...

525
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,400
Enjoy your meal!

526
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,100
You too!

527
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:53,860
And...

528
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,180
It's just because...

529
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,380
Like I'll finish something...

530
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:56,540
I'll...

531
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:56,900
Like...

532
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,220
I'm so afraid to type on stream because of it...

533
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,440
Because I know like...

534
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:01,680
Ouch!

535
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,600
Ugh...

536
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,720
Sorry, my eye is bothering me...

537
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,000
I know that if I...

538
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,360
Type...

539
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,880
If there's a certain phrase that I'm typing...

540
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
My brain will...

541
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,520
It like auto finishes...

542
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,580
And it's just...

543
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,140
It's just...

544
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,880
Hahaha...

545
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,620
It's so stupid...

546
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,200
Because I type things that I'm like...

547
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,480
Why did I type that?

548
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,640
I don't mean have fun at all...

549
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:22,900
Hahaha...

550
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,830
Don't have fun...

551
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,110
Not very nice there...

552
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,470
Hahaha...

553
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,310
30 minutes and we've made it to the file select...

554
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,150
We're cruising tonight guys...

555
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,130
No!

556
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:35,990
We're starting...

557
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,650
We're starting right now...

558
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,870
Okay, everybody comfy!

559
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,610
Let's start the game...

560
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:41,930
Hahaha...

561
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,950
And please I can't breathe...

562
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,830
Stop being hilarious...

563
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,450
For like one second...

564
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:46,750
Hahaha...

565
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,430
Hahaha...

566
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:48,890
Hahaha...

567
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,330
Hahaha...

568
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,310
Her brain is too far in the future...

569
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,450
I swear I'm...

570
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,730
I'm always clowning...

571
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,870
I'm always clowning...

572
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,850
Alright...

573
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,950
Alright...

574
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,710
Someone's dying you guys...

575
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,750
10.55 PM...

576
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:13,130
I went to try and rescue prisoner D99...

577
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,250
Even under ordinary circumstances...

578
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,570
That prison has a strange atmosphere...

579
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,530
But this time there's something even stranger about it...

580
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,930
Hey, I happened to enjoy it...

581
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,410
Enjoy the ghost yapping...

582
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,330
Thank you...

583
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,470
I'm calm...

584
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,410
I'm normal...

585
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,190
I'm normal...

586
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,750
An execution...

587
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,150
With my memory gone...

588
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,790
I don't have a clear image of what that is in my head...

589
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:44,270
But even I can sense the strong feeling of foreboding that hangs in the air...

590
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,990
You don't know what an execution is?

591
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,150
Maybe I'm too late?

592
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,110
No!

593
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,480
Oh!

594
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,460
He's...

595
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,420
He's grooving...

596
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,880
Is it really quiet?

597
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,820
I'm really...

598
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,360
Hold on...

599
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,620
I even turned up the sound...

600
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,460
Okay...

601
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:09,740
Well...

602
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,460
I'll turn it to 9...

603
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,100
The sound is fine...

604
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,020
It's pretty quiet on my...

605
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,500
It sounds quiet even to me...

606
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,200
Hmm...

607
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,020
I'll turn it up just a little bit...

608
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,200
Okay...

609
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:23,880
So...

610
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,060
So...

611
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,580
How's it going?

612
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,540
With the generator?

613
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,540
In the basement?

614
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,560
Why is...

615
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,040
Oh...

616
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,140
They're trying to fix it now...

617
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,260
It's gonna take a while...

618
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,780
They said...

619
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,120
They haven't even gotten the internal phone there back up yet...

620
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,880
Waiting for the inevitable...

621
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,920
Mint apologizes after being 3 hours late to her stream to explain that she was watching Circles in Sand stream...

622
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,020
Hey...

623
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,560
It's okay now...

624
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,460
I just hope...

625
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,240
The rowdies...

626
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,940
Don't rush the guard room...

627
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,660
Oh...

628
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,480
We don't have any rowdies here...

629
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,680
And what's more...

630
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,340
The one who committed the most atrocious crime isn't even here anymore at all...

631
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:05,720
Wait...

632
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:05,900
What?

633
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,020
You promised...

634
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,880
Not to talk...

635
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,820
About that...

636
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,170
Look...

637
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,190
Would you not get off with that weird flipping and flopping around?

638
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,010
I can't stand looking at it...

639
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,230
If you don't stop...

640
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,270
I just might have to...

641
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:24,870
How...

642
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:25,450
I'm not around you...

643
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,080
Where's the fanfic of these two?

644
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,580
This...

645
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,120
This is a glorious dance...

646
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,540
That's been passed down...

647
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,660
In my family for generations...

648
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,200
When you don't know...

649
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,160
What else to do...

650
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,880
Dance...

651
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,400
Dance...

652
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,160
Dance...

653
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,260
We call it...

654
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,860
The panic dance...

655
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,840
This is special detention...

656
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,320
Calling from the death chamber...

657
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,780
The internal phone is finally back up...

658
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,260
Oh...

659
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,040
It's pitch black down here though...

660
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,300
Until they get the generator going again...

661
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,820
How's it going up there?

662
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,920
The phone's been ringing off the hook from headquarters...

663
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,060
The death chamber...

664
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,020
Oh boy...

665
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,480
We can't let the existence of this prison become known to the outside world...

666
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,000
We'll have to round up the prisoners somehow...

667
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,260
I can't...

668
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,400
Is Bailey dancing?

669
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,520
Yep.

670
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,700
You should see him.

671
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,240
Wow!

672
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,500
Thank you for the 20 GIFs!

673
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,380
Wait...

674
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,140
Who is gifted?

675
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:48,660
Kita!

676
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,420
Thank you!

677
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,580
Thank you so much!

678
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,700
Take a video of it.

679
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,540
We can all watch it together when we're done.

680
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,100
Once the generator is back up, I'll record it with the security camera.

681
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,340
This is so messed up.

682
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,300
Someone is about to die and you're like...

683
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,320
Record that guy dancing.

684
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,780
And then we'll watch it after the guy is dead.

685
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,960
Oh my god!

686
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,340
I'm going...

687
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,660
The generator is still not up?

688
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,660
I can't keep this up much longer!

689
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,040
Believe me.

690
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,860
Nobody is asking you to.

691
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,180
Why don't you just stop?

692
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,920
Oh wait, this is the guy that has the accent, right?

693
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,700
He has a southern accent.

694
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,820
Will you dance instead then?

695
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,260
Are you kidding me?

696
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,160
Somebody has to do it!

697
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,260
Oh, he's going faster.

698
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,060
If that somebody is me, I'll keep dancing until I drop!

699
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,300
Oh my god, he's going even faster!

700
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,980
Despite how it looks, the situation seems pretty serious.

701
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,880
Bailey's dance is certainly intriguing.

702
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,180
Thank you for being awesome and as cool as heck!

703
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,480
Thank you, Kyory!

704
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,880
Thank you for one month!

705
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,380
But that telephone call that came in is even more interesting.

706
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,620
The man said he was calling from the death chamber, right?

707
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,500
Now that I have the extension number, I should go check it out!

708
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,100
Oh!

709
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,760
It's a trick?

710
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,020
Internal?

711
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,320
Special detention?

712
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,360
Was it that one?

713
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:35,460
Oh!

714
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,060
I assume the death chamber is...

715
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,200
Oh!

716
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,840
Whoa!

717
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,540
It's so dark.

718
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,760
This is not good.

719
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,320
Not good at all.

720
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,300
Fortnite emote the panic away.

721
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,400
Fortnite emote the panic away.

722
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,120
Yeah, I feel like a ghost is going to show up any minute now!

723
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:56,580
Yeah, I feel like a ghost is going to show up any minute now!

724
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,500
Now, wouldn't that be silly?

725
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,410
What?

726
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:14,840
B-b-b-ghost?

727
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,660
Hey, come on.

728
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,680
Show some respect.

729
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,580
There's a dead man here!

730
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,300
Wait, what?

731
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,880
That's right.

732
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,340
Me.

733
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,040
Wait, hold on.

734
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,560
That's right.

735
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,860
That's right.

736
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,440
That's right.

737
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,560
Me.

738
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,160
Mito.

739
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,820
Hey, Sissel.

740
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,100
I was dead before you, okay?

741
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,040
This is my shtick.

742
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,580
This is my shtick.

743
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,220
But whoo!

744
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,960
I never saw that one coming, did you?

745
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,240
Wait, so did they like electrocute him and it was so powerful?

746
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,160
It took out the power?

747
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:55,740
It took out the power?

748
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,440
Who could have?

749
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,580
Anyway, the generator is going to be fixed soon, so I guess we hang tight.

750
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,160
Okay.

751
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,600
There's a dead man?

752
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:03,980
Who?

753
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,900
I guess darkness doesn't really exist in the ghost world.

754
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,280
I guess darkness doesn't really exist in the ghost world.

755
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,980
Even without light, I can still see what's going on.

756
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,760
I can use the ghost world to help me find that generator.

757
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,540
A whole month already.

758
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,000
Thank you!

759
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,000
Lever.

760
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,820
Power supply.

761
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,480
Emergency light.

762
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,240
Water drop?

763
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,800
Oh, that will probably help me get down.

764
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,060
Wait, is that the dead man up there?

765
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,740
Uh oh.

766
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,020
Uh oh.

767
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,000
Oh no, it's a spoon.

768
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:44,860
Wait!

769
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,580
This is the guy who's been crawling out this whole time!

770
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,150
Oh my god.

771
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,450
Wait, where did the water drop go?

772
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,390
This must be it, right?

773
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,910
Oh jeez.

774
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,310
Where did that wrench go?

775
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,270
Without it, I can't tighten the last bolt on the generator.

776
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,170
Without it, I can't tighten the last bolt on the generator.

777
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,110
Work like a cave!

778
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,690
Or like a ghost.

779
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,830
This appears to be some kind of control panel.

780
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,310
I might be able to operate it.

781
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,330
But it doesn't seem to be responding.

782
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,890
It's too dark to really tell though.

783
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,590
I guess the first thing I need to do is to restore that generator.

784
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,730
So the wrench...

785
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,470
Hello!

786
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,250
Thank you!

787
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:42,880
I can't hold on much longer.

788
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,300
A line from the game just dug up a childhood...

789
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,460
child memory of the cliffhanger guy from Between the Lions.

790
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,040
Okay.

791
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,680
Huh?

792
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,110
Huh?

793
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:03,750
Huh?

794
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,250
Okay.

795
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,660
Cliffhanger.

796
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,220
Cliffhanger guy.

797
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
I don't know.

798
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,780
I don't know that one.

799
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,100
Actually, I don't think so.

800
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:28,740
Cliffhanger.

801
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,740
It says Between the Lions.

802
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,140
It says Between the Lions.

803
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,180
It's Between the Lions.

804
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,440
That's why he's called Cliffhanger.

805
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:41,880
That's why he's called Cliffhanger.

806
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,680
The real ones in chat give me.

807
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,200
The real ones in chat give me.

808
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,520
I've seen these things before.

809
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,540
Some kind of tool for turning things.

810
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,460
It's leaning up against the wall.

811
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,320
If I knock it over, I wonder if he'll notice.

812
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,840
Darn, it's too heavy.

813
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,740
It won't budge.

814
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,440
Let's see.

815
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,880
What's this?

816
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,000
It's a light.

817
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:05,940
Maybe...

818
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,280
I can barely...

819
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,880
Dang.

820
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,420
Okay.

821
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,920
Let's wait for the droplet to form again.

822
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:18,680
Okay.

823
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,580
Now if I go and drop...

824
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,440
Now I'm in the bucket.

825
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,780
I can't do anything in the bucket.

826
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,140
Toolbox.

827
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,320
Let's open it up.

828
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,560
Oh!

829
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,720
Oh, he saw it.

830
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,460
Oh, hey, there it is.

831
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,440
These guys remind me so much of like the...

832
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,040
What's it called?

833
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,680
The Genome Soldiers.

834
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,220
There.

835
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:50,600
Done.

836
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:54,530
Oh!

837
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,710
Yippie!

838
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,810
Wait, is this a good thing that we...

839
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,410
Is it a...

840
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:00,810
Oh!

841
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:01,990
Oh!

842
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:03,370
What?

843
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:09,750
Wait, so if the generator is off and all the cells just open?

844
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,730
I don't think that seems very...

845
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:13,590
Um...

846
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,970
Now the lights are back on.

847
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,150
But what happened here?

848
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,910
The answer is still shrouded in darkness.

849
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,230
Better see if I can pick up on some more information.

850
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,570
Can't seem to shake this bad feeling I've got.

851
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,490
Me too, though.

852
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,590
And then we'll...

853
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,390
Go to here.

854
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,250
This one.

855
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,550
Wait.

856
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,410
Oh my gosh!

857
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,470
The timing has to be...

858
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,230
Pitch perfect!

859
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:42,730
Okay.

860
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:46,570
There we go.

861
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,590
There we go.

862
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,090
Okay.

863
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,610
What if I lower this lever?

864
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,090
Didn't do anything.

865
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,450
Did someone say the door to darkness?

866
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:04,750
Hey, do you think this execution was really the right thing to do?

867
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,370
What the heck are you saying?

868
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,650
I mean, I know this country has the death penalty.

869
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,790
But how many years has it been since we used this chair?

870
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:17,730
What do you mean, was?

871
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:18,650
Uh oh.

872
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,630
Yeah, I don't know.

873
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,050
It had quite a bit of dust and dirt on it.

874
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,830
I bet that's what happened.

875
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,070
All that debris dropped on the floor.

876
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,070
Well, I think it was divine retribution.

877
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,310
Don't be stupid!

878
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,270
The prisoner wanted to be executed, you know?

879
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,660
He's dead!

880
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,120
Inspector Jowd!

881
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,660
I guess I was too late.

882
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,600
So when are they gonna pick up his body?

883
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:53,500
They'll be sending over a car from the public cemetery pretty soon!

884
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,600
After we hand over the body and clean up the mortuary, we're done!

885
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:00,880
Yeah, okay.

886
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,620
Yeah, okay.

887
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,780
Are we the baddies?

888
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,460
No!

889
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,380
No, no.

890
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,220
What else are they saying?

891
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,720
This chair scares me.

892
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,300
I don't want to repair it or get anywhere near it.

893
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,400
Why is there so much water?

894
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,820
Who knows when it's gonna blow... I knew it blew up!

895
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,660
Or let loose with the juice!

896
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,600
Just mint is the baddie, I think?

897
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,680
No, no, no.

898
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,140
Weirdest mortuary assistant DLC?

899
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,340
I'm not gonna lie, when they said mortuary, I also thought of mortuary assistant.

900
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:41,380
And then I remembered that is the scariest game I've ever played in my entire afterlife.

901
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,660
It's so scary!

902
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,180
Oh my gosh.

903
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,100
Loose with the juice.

904
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:47,840
Yikes.

905
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,700
Shut up, man.

906
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,680
Accidents can happen with anything after all.

907
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,380
But let's just get this thing fixed.

908
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:54,840
Come on.

909
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:00,100
If I'm executed by an accident, I'm gonna come back and haunt you.

910
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,760
I can make that happen.

911
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:02,960
Haunt me?

912
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,240
Why me?

913
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,100
Sounds like a pretty dangerous chair.

914
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,440
Hmm, a chair that gives shocks.

915
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,780
Can I use that somehow?

916
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,560
Oh, are you gonna kill them?

917
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,920
Oh my gosh, this little...

918
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:16,980
Kind of insane.

919
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,640
Wait, how do I get over there?

920
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:20,980
Uh...

921
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,580
Oh, the drips.

922
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,140
Oh, the drips.

923
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,080
Wait, I can't reach.

924
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,860
Let's see what he says.

925
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,280
So Detective Jowd has already been executed.

926
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,680
Looks like there was a reason for that bad feeling I was getting.

927
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,620
But that's okay.

928
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,480
This isn't a big problem for me.

929
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,080
But if the body is taken from the mortuary, that'll be bad.

930
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,760
I have to use my ghost tricks to save him before that happens.

931
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,840
Yeah, but how do I get over there?

932
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,880
My arm's too short.

933
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,360
Um... lever!

934
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,120
Does it do anything?

935
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,820
Oh, there's a phone in there.

936
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,240
Nobody probably called from in there though.

937
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,440
I don't think I have the extension.

938
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,700
Is he napping?

939
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,820
What's he doing up there?

940
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,120
Hmm...

941
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,340
Let's see.

942
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,240
Where is the water?

943
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,920
The water... from there...

944
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:36,780
Hmm...

945
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,300
He's taking a little nap, you guys.

946
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,120
I guess we'll go back to him.

947
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,300
Oh, wait.

948
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,080
Power destroyed.

949
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,200
Oh.

950
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,620
What do I say here?

951
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:53,760
Oh.

952
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,380
This guy seems to be taking...

953
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,880
Oh, he's actually taking a nap!

954
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,700
I doubt my paltry powers are enough to wake him.

955
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,500
Rest in peace, curry lover.

956
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,920
One month already, I love you and your grandma.

957
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:07,780
Ah, thanks!

958
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,480
It's kind of spooky when a ghost says it.

959
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:17,690
Can I...

960
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:19,070
Can I make it over...

961
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,010
No, there's no way.

962
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:22,850
Ah...

963
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:26,250
We have to ring the bell.

964
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:30,130
We have to go back and ring the bell so he goes home.

965
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:34,270
Uh...

966
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:35,030
Lower...

967
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,810
Row.

968
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,130
Time here still appears to be like a caged animal.

969
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:46,490
The only difference is I don't see any of the inmates.

970
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:47,990
Oh, wait.

971
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:48,390
It was the...

972
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:48,630
Wait.

973
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:51,490
And of course our death row inmate isn't here either.

974
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,090
Yeah, because he's dead.

975
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,130
What are you talking about?

976
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,270
Did the curry lover ever find his curry?

977
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:03,050
My time will soon be locked away from me as well.

978
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:04,750
I can't waste what I have left.

979
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:05,550
I better get going.

980
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:08,250
Trick time!

981
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:10,410
Yeah, so stop talking, buddy.

982
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:11,830
Oh...

983
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:12,770
Uh...

984
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:15,810
Oh...

985
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:17,950
Oh...

986
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:22,110
Uh...

987
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:23,730
Wait.

988
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:24,930
Uh...

989
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:33,630
Emergency button.

990
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:37,650
I better not set off the emergency alarm right now.

991
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:40,590
The inside of my head is already in a state of emergency as it is.

992
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:40,890
Okay.

993
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:41,550
Never mind.

994
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:43,430
Uh...

995
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:45,810
We'll go upstairs?

996
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,330
Oh my gosh.

997
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:50,250
Ugh.

998
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,050
All the...

999
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:51,990
All the...

1000
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,410
Sometimes messes with my head.

1001
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,420
No...

1002
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,300
Meow.

1003
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,940
My arm is too short.

1004
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,340
Wait.

1005
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,480
Can we go through the toilet?

1006
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,400
Or...

1007
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,480
Flash?

1008
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,000
No...

1009
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:17,700
Hmm...

1010
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:27,130
Let's try going back to the guard room, maybe.

1011
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,790
And seeing what's going on there.

1012
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:31,810
Oh.

1013
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:37,010
This panic dance has been passed down in our family for generations.

1014
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,790
There's just one problem with it.

1015
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:40,090
It's just...

1016
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,610
There's only one more thing that we need to do.

1017
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:13,630
Hey!

1018
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:14,070
Hey!

1019
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:14,810
Go down there and look at the floor!

1020
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:18,070
I like this guard.

1021
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:21,590
I don't remember his name, but I like his perpetual smirk.

1022
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:23,550
G-g-g-ghost!

1023
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:25,830
Thanks for one month!

1024
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:29,610
Guess it's hard for you to know when to stop talking too.

1025
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:31,690
Wait,

1026
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,480
this TV is now...

1027
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,940
Was it always facing... wasn't it facing us before?

1028
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,120
Or maybe not.

1029
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:46,240
What's

1030
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,180
going on here?

1031
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:52,900
Honk!

1032
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,600
Did they change seats?

1033
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,400
Yeah, they did.

1034
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,570
It's the panic dance.

1035
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,790
Jump out of your pants.

1036
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,530
It's the panic dance.

1037
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:43,990
We're panicking.

1038
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,750
We're panicking over something.

1039
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:47,950
We're panicking.

1040
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,710
We're panicking over something.

1041
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,630
Something has gone wrong.

1042
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:54,510
What could it be?

1043
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,830
Something has gone wrong.

1044
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,530
And it deals with me!

1045
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,170
The panic dance.

1046
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,970
It's the panic dance.

1047
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:04,230
Take off your pants.

1048
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:05,930
It's the panic dance.

1049
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,630
When you panic, you get hot.

1050
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,630
And that's why you don't need pants.

1051
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:11,910
The panic dance.

1052
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:13,890
It's the panic dance.

1053
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:17,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1054
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:20,310
It's the panic dance.

1055
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:21,870
The panic dance.

1056
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:24,470
What could be wrong?

1057
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,230
I don't know.

1058
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:30,430
But I feel really concerned.

1059
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,010
The panic dance.

1060
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,230
It's the panic dance.

1061
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,210
The panic dance.

1062
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,170
It's the panic dance.

1063
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:50,250
Anyway.

1064
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,920
How do

1065
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,260
I get to the spoon guy?

1066
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:04,720
I...

1067
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,680
Where are my pants?

1068
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,260
They're gone.

1069
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,840
Were you panicking?

1070
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,980
I'm in severe distress.

1071
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,100
I'm overthinking it.

1072
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,040
Or am I?

1073
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,400
Does it not have to do with him?

1074
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,140
I didn't mean to go that far.

1075
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,020
Back.

1076
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,740
Thanks for the pants.

1077
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,380
Oh, the jeans.

1078
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,320
Do I go to the bucket?

1079
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,220
And do something?

1080
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:04,860
No.

1081
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,020
Doodle bob?

1082
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,420
What do you mean doodle bob?

1083
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,200
No, wait.

1084
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,360
How am I supposed to get out?

1085
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:27,310
There we go.

1086
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:33,950
Manipulate.

1087
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,190
This appears to be some kind of control panel.

1088
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:37,290
I might be able to operate it.

1089
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:37,810
I'll give it a try.

1090
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:41,210
Beep boop.

1091
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:42,850
Oh!

1092
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:44,390
Oh my god.

1093
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:45,010
I'm gonna kill them.

1094
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:46,670
Some lamps came on.

1095
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:47,690
Not sure what that means.

1096
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,810
Maybe that changed the situation though.

1097
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:53,230
I think they're about to die.

1098
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:58,750
Oh wait.

1099
00:53:58,870 --> 00:53:59,690
Let's turn on the lever.

1100
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:01,270
Let's kill these guys.

1101
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:02,970
Execution!

1102
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:05,510
Okay.

1103
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:08,730
Hahaha.

1104
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:10,590
I just got a shock.

1105
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,610
You are shock.

1106
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:15,910
There we go.

1107
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:19,630
Bucket.

1108
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,310
Oh, dang it.

1109
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:25,410
Fast!

1110
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:28,530
Oh, I have to...

1111
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,270
Okay, okay.

1112
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:32,270
Fast!

1113
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:34,190
Shock, shock, shock.

1114
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,470
And I'm gonna rock that piece.

1115
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,510
And I'm gonna rock that piece.

1116
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:42,730
Spooky!

1117
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,450
Son of a...

1118
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:51,370
And then I'm gonna rock the cart.

1119
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:54,990
And then I'm gonna rock the cart.

1120
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:59,690
And then I'm gonna go back.

1121
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:00,590
And here.

1122
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:02,190
Oh, we're inside.

1123
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,190
Same thing here.

1124
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,730
Looks like this just...

1125
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:07,610
This is just an internal phone too.

1126
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:08,590
Doesn't call outside.

1127
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,830
So the only places I can go with this telephone are...

1128
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:15,830
Other phones within the building that I've already possessed.

1129
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:16,430
Okay.

1130
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,110
Spooky cart.

1131
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:20,730
Flower vase.

1132
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:22,690
Person's body.

1133
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:26,230
Hey, can you hear me?

1134
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:32,890
Where am I?

1135
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:33,790
Oh, he's...

1136
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:34,890
He's not alive.

1137
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:35,630
He's awake!

1138
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:38,170
This is the ghost world.

1139
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:39,350
The land of the dead.

1140
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,510
Detective Joud.

1141
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:42,930
Detective Joud.

1142
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:44,070
Who is that?

1143
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:45,010
Is that me?

1144
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:46,990
Oh boy, not you too.

1145
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,410
This is getting old.

1146
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,210
Thanks for the super child!

1147
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:56,670
Guess I'll just give the usual explanation.

1148
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,450
The dead lose their memories.

1149
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:02,070
Oh, so I'm dead, am I?

1150
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:04,270
I didn't realize that.

1151
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:06,090
It's you guys, right there.

1152
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:07,090
It's you, it's you.

1153
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:09,830
You're looking a little thin.

1154
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,030
You need to eat more.

1155
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:13,990
That's why you can't remember anything right now.

1156
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:16,130
That's fine with me.

1157
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:16,930
Huh?

1158
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:19,110
I don't like a messy room.

1159
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:21,250
But I hate cleaning up even more.

1160
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,710
Not having my memories is a welcome thing.

1161
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,950
Now I don't have to have as much...

1162
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:29,170
Trash to take out.

1163
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:31,570
Memories are like trash?

1164
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,390
Now that I'm dead...

1165
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,070
What do I need with memories?

1166
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:39,010
And things I don't need are just trash.

1167
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,530
Not to me.

1168
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:43,850
I need your memories.

1169
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:45,430
Besides...

1170
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:48,470
I promised Lin I'd try to stop your execution.

1171
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:50,330
Lin?

1172
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:57,390
It looks like I still have a few...

1173
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:00,010
Bits and pieces of garbage left lying around.

1174
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,050
Why does he call them garbage?

1175
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:02,510
Why does he call them garbage?

1176
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:06,470
Why does he call them garbage?

1177
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:08,090
I remember now.

1178
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:08,930
I remember now.

1179
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,560
About Lin, Jowd, and the execution?

1180
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,060
About Lin, Jowd, and the execution?

1181
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,200
What about you?

1182
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,540
Who are you?

1183
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,660
You only remember those things because I told you.

1184
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,880
Sir Jowdington right there.

1185
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:34,100
Sir Jowdington right there.

1186
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,080
I'm Sissel.

1187
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,660
I'm looking for my memory.

1188
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,880
Or trash as you call it.

1189
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:40,740
Sissel...

1190
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,340
Does my name ring a bell?

1191
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,660
I think you know me.

1192
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,120
Sorry...

1193
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,720
It must not have been a very big piece of trash to me.

1194
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,840
I wanna let you guys know...

1195
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,640
That you're all big pieces of trash to me.

1196
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:54,920
Okay?

1197
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:58,840
You're all...

1198
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,840
Big pieces of trash.

1199
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,120
Thanks man.

1200
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:05,120
Hahaha

1201
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:08,980
I'm honored.

1202
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:13,150
That's alright.

1203
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:16,250
I guess you'll find out when you get your memory back.

1204
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:17,790
But for now...

1205
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:19,230
I'd like you to come back with me.

1206
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:21,290
Back to four minutes before your execution.

1207
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:23,690
This is gonna be so traumatic.

1208
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:24,450
Oh my god.

1209
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:26,970
It's not just a regular death.

1210
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:27,810
It's an execution.

1211
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,950
It's the nicest thing anyone's ever said about me.

1212
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:33,750
Yeah.

1213
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:33,790
Yeah.

1214
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:38,290
This is the past?

1215
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:39,630
Four minutes before my death?

1216
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:44,350
That's right.

1217
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:46,150
Sorry.

1218
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:48,050
You'll get to see your own execution.

1219
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:49,910
Don't smile and say that.

1220
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:52,570
And then we're gonna change your fate.

1221
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:55,050
But first, can I ask you a question?

1222
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,410
Wait, four minutes before this guy is dead?

1223
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:58,750
He's not even in the chair yet?

1224
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,470
They got it done so quickly.

1225
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:03,550
Lynn told you, didn't she?

1226
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:04,770
About what I did?

1227
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:07,090
Yeah, she did.

1228
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,330
Well actually, we found out from a newspaper.

1229
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:12,870
Then is it really the right thing to do?

1230
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:14,350
To save a guy like me?

1231
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:16,370
I don't know.

1232
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,850
But Lynn believes it is.

1233
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,010
Okay, let's get started.

1234
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:30,100
Oh!

1235
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:31,740
Jinkies!

1236
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,700
Oh no!

1237
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,280
It's stuck!

1238
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,160
It's clogged!

1239
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,200
Uh-oh.

1240
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,080
This is what happens when...

1241
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,180
Uh-oh.

1242
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,600
This is what happens when you...

1243
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,900
flush stuff other than...

1244
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,560
poop down the toilet.

1245
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,400
Wait, what did he say?

1246
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,040
I was too busy thinking about poop.

1247
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:01,710
It's time.

1248
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:03,330
Thank you for the food.

1249
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,930
That's a lot of ketchup.

1250
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:17,270
No!

1251
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:18,530
Don't you do it too!

1252
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:20,870
What was in the trash can...

1253
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,330
that you couldn't flush it?

1254
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:24,390
Or that you couldn't throw away your napkin?

1255
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:27,370
Uh-oh.

1256
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:28,010
Oh my god.

1257
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:28,610
They're all the same.

1258
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,560
Oh my god.

1259
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:37,880
Sorry.

1260
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,760
I keep yawning.

1261
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,480
So the time's finally here, huh?

1262
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,080
Too busy thinking about poop.

1263
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:43,920
Eating choices?

1264
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,080
Yeah.

1265
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,700
I wonder how many years it's been.

1266
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,060
The last time, you weren't even here yet.

1267
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,060
I never thought I'd have to...

1268
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:52,820
attend an execution.

1269
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,040
But you know, I wonder why the justice minister...

1270
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,020
suddenly signed the order.

1271
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,460
There's definitely something up with that.

1272
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:01,720
Hey, come on!

1273
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,020
Let's just focus on our work.

1274
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,860
This guy is such a doubter.

1275
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,340
I love him.

1276
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:06,780
Vivicore!

1277
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,380
Thanks for the...

1278
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,560
thank you!

1279
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,860
Yeah, alright.

1280
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,180
Ten.

1281
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,880
Left, right, left, right.

1282
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,660
Down, down.

1283
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,200
Prisoner D99!

1284
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:26,480
It's time!

1285
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:28,560
Let's go!

1286
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,580
Alright, men.

1287
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:32,880
I'm ready.

1288
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,060
Sorry to have to go through this...

1289
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:37,860
Oh, sorry you have to go through this...

1290
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:38,960
unpleasant experience.

1291
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:40,620
What?

1292
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,100
No!

1293
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,240
We uh...

1294
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:43,820
Oh well.

1295
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,700
I guess it's all about collecting...

1296
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:46,240
experiences.

1297
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:47,540
For you...

1298
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,480
and for me.

1299
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,940
Oh my god...

1300
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:51,220
Troy!

1301
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,460
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

1302
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,400
Thank you so much!

1303
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:54,900
Thank you, thank you.

1304
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,960
Can't get over his Chad face.

1305
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,200
This guy is such a Chad face.

1306
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,860
I think the Chad meme was based off of him.

1307
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,840
Oh my god...

1308
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,100
Prepare to test!

1309
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:10,760
Throw the switch!

1310
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:16,470
Wait, it explodes?

1311
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:18,010
And then...

1312
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:18,870
he dies?

1313
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:30,290
So this is an execution, huh?

1314
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:32,230
Seems to me there's got to be...

1315
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:33,170
a safer way to do it.

1316
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:36,050
It must be nice to have...

1317
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:36,950
no memory like that.

1318
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:39,510
It makes things more interesting.

1319
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:40,490
I envy you.

1320
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:41,370
I really do.

1321
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:44,530
It's no laughing matter to me.

1322
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,150
This guy is so awesome.

1323
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:48,110
That was an example of a...

1324
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:48,790
failed execution.

1325
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:50,770
Although the outcome was the same.

1326
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:53,850
Fail?

1327
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:56,270
They haven't...

1328
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:58,110
carried out an execution in a long time.

1329
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:00,090
Wait, what if...

1330
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:01,090
it was one of the guards?

1331
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:04,050
We're going to switch...

1332
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:05,430
the guard position and...

1333
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:06,850
the Chad position.

1334
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:10,090
They dragged that old chair out...

1335
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,230
from under some mothballs.

1336
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:12,790
And I guess it had a short.

1337
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:15,110
So I guess that means that...

1338
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:16,950
if I can stop the explosion...

1339
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:18,810
I don't know about that.

1340
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,290
Then I'd be executed as planned.

1341
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:22,870
And I'd still wind up...

1342
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:23,450
just as dead.

1343
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:26,910
So what should I do?

1344
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:28,850
Beats me.

1345
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,290
You're the one who came to save me.

1346
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:32,470
You figure it out.

1347
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,470
He's not making this easy.

1348
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:36,570
I mean, can you blame him?

1349
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:37,970
I actually agree with him.

1350
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:40,790
Rewind...

1351
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:41,590
time.

1352
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:45,870
Trick time.

1353
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,580
Who you calling?

1354
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,120
How's it going down there?

1355
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,400
We just finished setting up the chair.

1356
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:58,380
We're all prepared.

1357
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,000
I see.

1358
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,240
It's time.

1359
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,820
Please bring in the prisoner.

1360
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,000
But that chair!

1361
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,180
It hasn't been used in a long time.

1362
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,480
What if...

1363
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,580
There's nothing we can do now.

1364
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:12,780
It's time.

1365
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:16,700
Alright.

1366
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,680
I'll send the guards to his cell.

1367
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,480
I'll have them call when they get into position.

1368
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,300
I'll have them call when they get into position.

1369
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,320
Okay, we go there.

1370
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:28,660
Okay, we go there.

1371
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,640
Did he just say, do it yourself?

1372
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,080
Basically.

1373
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:33,780
Basically.

1374
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,380
Oh my god, this guy is drunk.

1375
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,900
I have this strange feeling of uneasiness.

1376
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,680
I must dance it out.

1377
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:44,880
How about you?

1378
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:45,860
How do you feel?

1379
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:46,280
How do you feel?

1380
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,100
I feel chubby and jittery.

1381
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,140
And I can't sit still.

1382
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,340
I feel like I might start dancing at any minute.

1383
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,300
If you're gonna dance, let me know.

1384
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,020
I'll get the video camera ready.

1385
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:04,080
Nobody will listen to my concerns.

1386
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:05,760
Concerns, huh?

1387
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
So he's worried.

1388
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,460
That man is always worried about something.

1389
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:13,620
Whatever he's worried about, it always comes true without fail.

1390
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:14,780
Hmm.

1391
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:21,600
Listen to me.

1392
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:22,740
That chair is dangerous.

1393
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:24,620
I know, Bailey.

1394
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,240
That's why I don't advise you to sit on it.

1395
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,460
No, no, no.

1396
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:30,340
That's not what I mean.

1397
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,940
Machines like that are very sensitive to dust.

1398
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:39,060
If the guys throw the switch and the chair shorts out, there might be a huge explosion down there in that death chamber.

1399
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,400
Oh my god, he called the whole thing.

1400
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,320
Oh, come on.

1401
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,580
Nothing's gonna happen.

1402
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:49,920
Besides, even if on the off chance it does blow up, we're way up here.

1403
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,040
We'll be fine.

1404
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,220
I know.

1405
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,480
Why don't we go and test it out first?

1406
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:56,780
No way.

1407
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,560
I don't wanna get blown up.

1408
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,640
You go by yourself.

1409
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,840
So this spot would be safe even if it does blow up, eh?

1410
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:06,420
What is it?

1411
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,260
You have a new look in your eye.

1412
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,360
Why can't I stop yawning?

1413
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:17,940
If the switch in the death chamber is thrown, the chair will blow up.

1414
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:19,540
The chair will blow up?

1415
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:19,900
That's right.

1416
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,140
And if the chair blows up, the execution can't be carried out.

1417
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,080
True.

1418
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,040
It only stands to reason.

1419
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:36,440
And, if there's nobody in the death chamber when the chair explodes, nobody will die.

1420
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:38,460
Precisely.

1421
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,200
Very nice, Sissel.

1422
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,360
You've hit upon some excellent points there.

1423
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,360
Okay, I'm starting to see a plan now.

1424
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:46,340
Sophie!

1425
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:53,610
How do we have nobody in there?

1426
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:55,810
Time is passing!

1427
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:57,210
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

1428
01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:58,690
Um...

1429
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:01,170
Let's dial...

1430
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:02,130
Um...

1431
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:05,270
Oh yes, that's right, we can't use the phone lines.

1432
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:06,050
Ow!

1433
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,910
I can only move over phone lines in the past when it's in use.

1434
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:14,710
Sadly, this applies to the internal extensions as well.

1435
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:18,250
Get everyone up there.

1436
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:19,050
Get everyone up there.

1437
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:19,050
Exactly!

1438
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:20,910
Everybody has to come up here.

1439
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:22,110
Or...

1440
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:24,870
Or, or, or, or, or...

1441
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:27,750
We somehow pull the switch early.

1442
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:30,110
I think.

1443
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:33,830
Getting the chair short out...

1444
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:37,350
Why can't I stop yawning?

1445
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:37,710
Hold on.

1446
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:39,250
I'm gonna eat a cookie.

1447
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:45,060
Cookie time, it's cookie time.

1448
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,180
Maybe some sugar will help me.

1449
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:50,480
Eat the ghost.

1450
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:52,640
Ah!

1451
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:00,730
I dropped my controller.

1452
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:11,460
In the past world, I can't just use the phone lines whenever I want.

1453
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:11,860
In the past world, I can't just use the phone lines whenever I want.

1454
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,460
These guards seem to be in a fog.

1455
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,600
I doubt they'll be using the phone much.

1456
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:16,900
I doubt they'll be using the phone much.

1457
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,280
Maybe I need to start over?

1458
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:20,160
Wait, no!

1459
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:20,640
What?

1460
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,260
What do you mean?

1461
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:22,600
Wait, no!

1462
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:34,410
What do you mean?

1463
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,640
Maybe I do need to start over.

1464
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:51,690
I'm stuck here.

1465
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:59,240
I thought he said he would call.

1466
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:03,860
I thought he said he would call.

1467
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:06,740
He said he would call when it's time for the guy to go there.

1468
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:07,120
He said he would call when it's time for the guy to go there.

1469
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:13,420
I'm just sorry I didn't get to see Bailey's famous dancing.

1470
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,340
Getting the chair to short out when nobody's around it.

1471
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,640
The plan is starting to solidify in my mind.

1472
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,820
But I better find a different path next time.

1473
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,480
From the beginning.

1474
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,000
From the beginning.

1475
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,340
Did he say he would call?

1476
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:32,540
I thought he did say he would call.

1477
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:33,220
I thought he did say he would call.

1478
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:33,980
Hold back.

1479
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:37,060
I think we need to attach ourselves to...

1480
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,640
I think we need to attach ourselves to...

1481
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,360
This guy, maybe.

1482
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,280
This guy, maybe.

1483
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:48,620
Got it!

1484
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:51,940
Oh.

1485
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:53,680
Oh.

1486
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:55,980
Alright then.

1487
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,020
Four minutes from now.

1488
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,040
This chair will short out and explode and you'll die.

1489
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:01,740
This chair will short out and explode and you'll die.

1490
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,400
It's very sad.

1491
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,280
If I stop the explosion, you'll be executed and you'll still die.

1492
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,560
Sorry I was ever born.

1493
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,840
I have to protect you from the explosion and stop the execution.

1494
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,860
The key to this whole thing must be this chair.

1495
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,040
The key to this whole thing must be this chair.

1496
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,340
I apologize for all your trouble.

1497
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:23,000
Could you stop with the insincere comments?

1498
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,740
Could you stop with the insincere comments?

1499
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:28,420
Wait am I stuck here?

1500
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:28,760
Oh!

1501
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:31,140
Oh here we go.

1502
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,280
Now it's time to go get the prisoner.

1503
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,400
Now it's time to go get the prisoner.

1504
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,660
I'm going to bring the prisoner to you now.

1505
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:40,780
Got it.

1506
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,360
I feel like we have to try every spot.

1507
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,300
Unless they call one more time.

1508
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,400
But maybe they don't.

1509
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,420
They might not call one more time.

1510
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,560
I don't know.

1511
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:58,840
I have no idea.

1512
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,120
I don't know.

1513
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,180
We can get...

1514
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,400
We can go to the paper.

1515
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:05,920
Okay.

1516
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:08,660
Paper.

1517
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:10,900
Open up the note.

1518
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,420
Let it free.

1519
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:14,640
Oh!

1520
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:16,540
Alright!

1521
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:18,800
My jam grooved off the clock.

1522
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,420
Now get down there to Sausage Head.

1523
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:22,960
Go!

1524
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,280
Go!

1525
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:23,720
Go!

1526
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:25,700
Okay.

1527
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:27,840
Oh wait!

1528
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:28,500
Wait!

1529
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:34,560
That was terrifying.

1530
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,260
Oh god he is so gross.

1531
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:46,470
Okay.

1532
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:46,950
Okay.

1533
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:49,890
Okay.

1534
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:51,370
Okay.

1535
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:53,390
What is this for?

1536
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:59,650
In the present world, four minutes into the future, Sausage Head was lying passed out in the tunnel.

1537
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:03,030
Oh I wonder if the shock got him.

1538
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:06,470
Not knowing about the execution, he must have kept digging and digging.

1539
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,950
And the guards didn't notice he was gone?

1540
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:14,310
So I guess Curry Man's future has now changed a bit.

1541
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:16,650
Fate changed!

1542
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:18,230
Okay.

1543
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:18,650
Oh!

1544
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:20,170
Uh...

1545
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:23,090
Uh...

1546
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:24,870
Oh no I can't reach it.

1547
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:27,710
But we need to get to...

1548
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,120
Oh yes!

1549
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:36,920
We ring this.

1550
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:39,200
Because he needs to go back downstairs, right?

1551
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,520
He needs to go back...

1552
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,480
Why is he so freaky?

1553
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,040
He needs to...

1554
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,460
We need to go with him back in there.

1555
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,200
Because that's how we get into the other room.

1556
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,880
And he licks it.

1557
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:54,360
Okay.

1558
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,800
Attached to the spoon.

1559
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,320
Yeah we're gonna use him.

1560
01:12:58,380 --> 01:12:58,960
We're gonna use him.

1561
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,580
Come on!

1562
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:04,160
Hurry it up!

1563
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,440
Oh never mind.

1564
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:10,680
I thought he would go back inside.

1565
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:12,740
Um...

1566
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:13,900
Just kidding.

1567
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,760
But that's okay.

1568
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,080
We can now go to his place.

1569
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:20,660
To you.

1570
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,360
And um...

1571
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,680
The napkin.

1572
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,040
What did he do with the napkin again?

1573
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:28,800
Oh he also flushed the napkin!

1574
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,840
He also flushed the napkin.

1575
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,840
I think we have to be the napkin.

1576
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:35,120
And then we...

1577
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,480
When we get flushed...

1578
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,360
We can then go downstairs.

1579
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:40,540
Probably.

1580
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,760
After looking in the trash can.

1581
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,740
Yeah what's in there?

1582
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:46,800
Open?

1583
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:47,980
Oh!

1584
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:51,820
Wait a second!

1585
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:53,240
Woah woah woah!

1586
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:53,900
Wait!

1587
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:00,250
How do we get the circle?

1588
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,500
I might have to restart.

1589
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,220
Oh he noticed it's full.

1590
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,360
This thing is as full as I am.

1591
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,140
Oh no!

1592
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:22,680
It needed to be!

1593
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:23,880
Okay.

1594
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:24,820
We know though.

1595
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:25,380
We know now.

1596
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,540
We know now.

1597
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,460
If he gets it...

1598
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:32,620
If he gets it...

1599
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:35,460
I'm actually curious.

1600
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,900
If he grabs this...

1601
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,120
Will we be able to do it again?

1602
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:38,480
I wonder.

1603
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,180
We know now.

1604
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,340
We know now.

1605
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,220
It's too late?

1606
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,700
Is it because he's not eating anymore?

1607
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:53,060
Oh shoot!

1608
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:53,740
Oh shoot!

1609
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:54,480
Oh shoot!

1610
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,040
There we go.

1611
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:57,820
I almost missed my chance.

1612
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,440
Okay never mind.

1613
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:00,140
It's too late!

1614
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,620
We gotta restart!

1615
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,860
He's not eating anymore!

1616
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,700
He's just sitting there.

1617
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,520
It's so sad.

1618
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,680
Okay let's restart.

1619
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,920
After fate change.

1620
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:14,500
Okay.

1621
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:15,880
That's okay.

1622
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,080
Now...

1623
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:22,820
Uh...

1624
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:23,820
Your soup!

1625
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,160
Your soup!

1626
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:30,280
Do you have a favorite instant curry brand?

1627
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,940
I've only ever bought Vermont curry.

1628
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,880
But I feel like maybe I should look at others.

1629
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:34,580
P.S.

1630
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:35,140
prisons are the best.

1631
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,800
Open all doors that the power goes out.

1632
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:39,440
So that if there's a fire, it won't burn all the inmates.

1633
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:40,880
Oh!

1634
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,540
Which has happened before.

1635
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:47,040
There has been fires in...

1636
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:47,700
What was it?

1637
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:49,100
Alcatraz?

1638
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:52,880
Oh my gosh.

1639
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,200
I wanna go to Alcatraz.

1640
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,060
So badly.

1641
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:00,680
I wanna go.

1642
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,240
But the one day that...

1643
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,440
Me and Matara can maybe go.

1644
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:07,180
They weren't...

1645
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:08,620
They were all full.

1646
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,740
I just dropped my drink.

1647
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:12,100
Hold on.

1648
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:17,790
I don't know.

1649
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:19,950
Oh man.

1650
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,600
I think it's fine.

1651
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,880
I just dropped the straw side.

1652
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,920
Right onto the floor though.

1653
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,620
So I can't drink anymore of it.

1654
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:32,900
That's fine.

1655
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,300
But yeah.

1656
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:37,060
I really wanna go.

1657
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:38,780
I've never been.

1658
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,880
I've never been to San Francisco before.

1659
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:44,180
But because of Off-Kai.

1660
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:45,640
I can go.

1661
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,200
I will be able to visit.

1662
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,220
So I was like I wanna visit Alcatraz.

1663
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:50,840
But I can't.

1664
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:51,540
I can't go.

1665
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:52,960
I don't know.

1666
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,760
We might maybe try a different time.

1667
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:57,000
If there's any openings.

1668
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,520
Or if the place is open too.

1669
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,180
But yeah.

1670
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:08,200
I wanna go.

1671
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:08,860
I wanna go.

1672
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,540
It closes really early?

1673
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:14,180
Like 3pm?

1674
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,400
No, no, no, no.

1675
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,760
We looked at the website.

1676
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,240
They have...

1677
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,380
We were gonna try for...

1678
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:22,420
They have night time tours as well.

1679
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,700
And we were gonna try.

1680
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,940
Even though she was scared.

1681
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,040
I was like come on.

1682
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,940
It's probably fine.

1683
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,420
It's probably fine.

1684
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:34,080
It's probably fine.

1685
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,300
And I'm a ghost.

1686
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,680
Like what?

1687
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,160
I'm gonna run into another ghost?

1688
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:43,940
Ring-a-ling-a-ling.

1689
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,260
Ring-a-ling.

1690
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:48,080
Oh my god.

1691
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,260
Did anyone else play Dragalia?

1692
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:52,360
Ring-a-ling.

1693
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:59,000
The way he like slurps his spoon.

1694
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,380
It's so weird.

1695
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:04,920
Oh my gosh.

1696
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,040
I have to be pretty...

1697
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,560
I have to go pretty quickly with this.

1698
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:07,860
I think.

1699
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:09,380
Huh?

1700
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,020
Oh Will.

1701
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,420
I missed Dragalia.

1702
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,260
Me too.

1703
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,060
I missed Dragalia so much.

1704
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:18,040
Alright.

1705
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,360
What is the order here?

1706
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:25,460
Maybe.

1707
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,260
I might have to restart one more time.

1708
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:39,220
But he looks like he's gonna have to restart.

1709
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:43,020
He has to be holding his...

1710
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,260
I think one...

1711
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:44,460
Okay.

1712
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,300
I think it's the timing of when he's holding the napkin over the trash can.

1713
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:49,880
But before he opens it.

1714
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:50,140
Right?

1715
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:52,520
Yeah.

1716
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,160
It needs the O.

1717
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:53,720
It needs...

1718
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:54,320
Now!

1719
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:55,480
Now!

1720
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:55,820
Now!

1721
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:56,480
Yeah!

1722
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:03,330
Wow.

1723
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:09,210
Let me possess the napkin.

1724
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:12,870
Let me possess the napkin.

1725
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:15,230
Perfect timing.

1726
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:22,210
Ring-a-ling!

1727
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:25,430
Time is passing.

1728
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:26,230
Okay.

1729
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:27,930
And now we're gonna possess the spoon.

1730
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,410
Once he brings us up.

1731
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:32,110
Once he brings us up.

1732
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,800
Can I reach it now?

1733
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:37,880
No.

1734
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:38,240
Not yet.

1735
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,740
Time is passing.

1736
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:42,400
Oh!

1737
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:42,820
Oh!

1738
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:43,260
Oh!

1739
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:43,600
Oh!

1740
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,160
Spoon!

1741
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:50,760
Ta-da!

1742
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:54,310
Okay.

1743
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:55,230
Very nice.

1744
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:59,950
This is the most lax prison I've ever seen.

1745
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:00,290
Ever.

1746
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:01,910
Okay.

1747
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:02,470
Alright.

1748
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:03,390
Alright.

1749
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:04,010
Hurry up please!

1750
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:04,650
Hurry up!

1751
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:06,010
Oh!

1752
01:20:06,910 --> 01:20:07,470
Eww!

1753
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,550
Oh God!

1754
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:10,390
Okay.

1755
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:10,750
Come on.

1756
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:11,270
Crawl!

1757
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:12,270
Crawl man!

1758
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:12,930
Crawl!

1759
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:17,150
Okay.

1760
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:17,770
Okay.

1761
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:29,770
Okay.

1762
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:29,770
Okay.

1763
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:29,770
Sorry.

1764
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:31,380
That guy was still in the hole but...

1765
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:32,010
Sorry.

1766
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:33,010
That guy was still in the hole but...

1767
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:37,650
What just happened?

1768
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:40,870
We just stopped to death.

1769
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:44,090
The power's down throughout the whole facility!

1770
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:45,410
No way!

1771
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:47,250
If the power's down that means...

1772
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:47,330
No way!

1773
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:47,330
If the power's down that means...

1774
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:49,530
All the cell bars open automatically!

1775
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:51,870
Damn it.

1776
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:53,930
The internal phones aren't working either.

1777
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:55,170
State of emergency!

1778
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:58,450
Now the execution can't be carried out.

1779
01:20:58,530 --> 01:20:59,850
And your life is saved.

1780
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:04,950
Crisis averted.

1781
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:07,810
You're a pretty daring guy.

1782
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,250
I really enjoyed myself.

1783
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:12,430
And I think I learned a thing or two as well.

1784
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:13,970
About what?

1785
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:15,950
By the way.

1786
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:17,370
Is it true what the guard said?

1787
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:19,190
Cell bars open automatically?

1788
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:21,170
Jailbreak!

1789
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:22,990
Yep.

1790
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:23,430
It's true.

1791
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:25,350
It's a little drawback to the system.

1792
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:27,630
If the entire facility blacks out...

1793
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:28,450
The locks are released.

1794
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:29,770
For the prisoners' safety.

1795
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:33,610
But nobody thought it would actually ever happen.

1796
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,090
So in other words...

1797
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:39,130
Now is the time to escape if you're gonna.

1798
01:21:39,710 --> 01:21:41,790
Anyway, we managed to stop the execution.

1799
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:43,750
Let's get back to the present.

1800
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:46,410
You're still not out of the woods yet.

1801
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:48,870
And now that guy's gonna get his memories back.

1802
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:49,970
He can tell us who we are.

1803
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:50,770
Oh my gosh.

1804
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:53,270
Let me give you one piece of advice.

1805
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:54,730
What's that?

1806
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:57,110
When we get back to the present.

1807
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:58,450
Head for the spoon.

1808
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:01,330
Okay.

1809
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:01,670
Spoon?

1810
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:04,570
You'll see when we get back, Sissel.

1811
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:06,690
Okay.

1812
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:07,670
Time to go to the spoon.

1813
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:12,010
Spoon, spoon, spoon.

1814
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:12,490
Oh my gosh.

1815
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:13,470
He wants to spoon me.

1816
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,830
Now the execution can't be carried out.

1817
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,750
Detective Jao is safe for the moment.

1818
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:20,710
A new present has been born.

1819
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:21,930
However...

1820
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:26,450
Jao still isn't safe from execution, of course.

1821
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:28,570
I guess I still have a job to do.

1822
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:31,210
Help a death row inmate escape from prison.

1823
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:32,090
Oh yeah!

1824
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:39,250
Yippee!

1825
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:44,110
We cleared the 1055 to 1109 challenge.

1826
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:45,290
Challenge!

1827
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:47,750
Jao taken by fate.

1828
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:49,930
Nice!

1829
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:50,930
That one wasn't so bad.

1830
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:57,450
This level coming up is the worst level in the game?

1831
01:22:58,030 --> 01:22:58,390
Uh oh.

1832
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:00,310
Okay.

1833
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:03,530
I'm mentally preparing myself.

1834
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,710
Yeah, that chapter was pretty short.

1835
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:08,110
Now I'm back in the present.

1836
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:09,690
And it's completely shrouded in darkness.

1837
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:11,070
I can't see it.

1838
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:13,250
But I can feel the tension in the air.

1839
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:14,590
It's a state of emergency.

1840
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:16,070
Yeah, it's not good.

1841
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:17,570
You'll see why very quickly.

1842
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:18,530
It's really rough.

1843
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:18,970
Okay.

1844
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:20,250
Thanks guys for the warning.

1845
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:21,970
And that's only natural.

1846
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:25,010
With the power failure, all of the cell bars opened automatically.

1847
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:28,170
Plus now a death row inmate is loose in the darkness.

1848
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,800
I did what I promised Lin.

1849
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,380
I stopped the execution.

1850
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:40,360
But that condemned criminal is now in just as much danger as before.

1851
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:42,600
Okay.

1852
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:43,400
To the spoon.

1853
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:48,320
What are these guys?

1854
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,900
Oh, these guys are working on it.

1855
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:51,400
Let's go to the spoon.

1856
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:53,620
Okay.

1857
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:53,920
I'm here.

1858
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:02,750
The detective told me to head for the spoon when I got back to the present.

1859
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:03,950
So here I am.

1860
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:06,690
And he is asleep.

1861
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:07,650
Like before.

1862
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:09,590
Oh!

1863
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:10,170
He's awake!

1864
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:11,230
Oh god.

1865
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:12,690
He's going to...

1866
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:13,250
The bell!

1867
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:14,050
Better get back!

1868
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:15,110
Oh god.

1869
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,270
He's so scary.

1870
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:17,130
This guy.

1871
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:19,890
Blahblahblahblahblahblahblah!

1872
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:22,150
Woo!

1873
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:22,670
I'm back!

1874
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:32,830
But first I have to find him.

1875
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:33,450
Oh gosh.

1876
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:35,330
Is this like a sneaking mission?

1877
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:38,090
But... in this game?

1878
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:42,870
Oh my god!

1879
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:46,050
It's prisoner C-74!

1880
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:47,310
Secure the prisoner!

1881
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:49,230
Oh no!

1882
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:50,510
I see.

1883
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:54,690
Oh no!

1884
01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:57,490
It looks like there are hunters in this darkness!

1885
01:24:58,210 --> 01:25:00,350
I hope they haven't found Detective Joud.

1886
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:03,510
Oh no!

1887
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:07,110
Where is he?

1888
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:11,650
He's not here.

1889
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:11,950
Oh!

1890
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:12,370
Oh!

1891
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,390
What's that red light?

1892
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:19,290
Looks like the hunter's eyes glow red.

1893
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,600
Oh no!

1894
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,300
Doesn't look like escape is going to be easy.

1895
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,360
Round!

1896
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:38,700
Oh my god!

1897
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,940
Look at him!

1898
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,160
Oh my god!

1899
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,000
Wow!

1900
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,260
He's just a ball!

1901
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:56,010
Let's talk to him.

1902
01:25:57,650 --> 01:25:58,670
Ah, there you are.

1903
01:25:58,790 --> 01:26:00,190
I was wondering what I was going to do.

1904
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:03,090
Are you the one who made that toilet bell ring?

1905
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:04,310
That's right.

1906
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:06,370
I still had another napkin lying around.

1907
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:08,710
Thanks to that I managed to make it here.

1908
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:10,730
How did you know how to do that?

1909
01:26:12,190 --> 01:26:16,030
I learned a few things about your ghost tricks during our time together.

1910
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:18,570
Peak form.

1911
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:19,950
I love him.

1912
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,620
They certainly can be very useful powers.

1913
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,500
But at times, not so much.

1914
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:37,580
I knew that if the internal phones weren't working, you'd be trapped in the death chamber area.

1915
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,100
So I quickly came up with an alternative route.

1916
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,160
How did he know about the guy digging underneath this prison though?

1917
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,200
Does everyone just know that?

1918
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:53,640
A route that made use of Sausage Head's spoon in my napkin.

1919
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:55,860
Wow, this detective is good.

1920
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,140
He's pretty good.

1921
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:00,340
Next time you praise me, go ahead and say it out loud.

1922
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,400
He can read my thoughts.

1923
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:02,780
I forgot.

1924
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,300
Oh yeah, he did see me in there.

1925
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:05,500
Right.

1926
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:06,080
That's true.

1927
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:10,240
Anyway, it looks like it's time for a strategy meeting.

1928
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,800
An escape strategy, huh?

1929
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:14,240
This could be interesting.

1930
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,280
Let's do it.

1931
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:17,920
Escape strategy.

1932
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:21,940
Let's make sure we're both clear.

1933
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:25,660
The key to my escape is this darkness.

1934
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:30,500
Once the basement power supply is restored, escape will be impossible.

1935
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:31,260
Okay, okay.

1936
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,160
Thanks for the super chat, Vampire.

1937
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:35,900
Thank you.

1938
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,520
So we move under cover of darkness, huh?

1939
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,600
I know I won't have much trouble with that.

1940
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:44,160
But I'm afraid I won't be able to see.

1941
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,660
So you'll have to lead the way.

1942
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:47,740
Lead the way?

1943
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,800
Cecil sometimes like...

1944
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:51,900
Cecil sometimes kind of like Snake.

1945
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,280
Lead the way.

1946
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:58,200
Once you find a safe spot for me to move to, I want you to give me a signal.

1947
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,140
Anchor, thanks for the super chat.

1948
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,220
Okay, fine.

1949
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:03,700
But how?

1950
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,080
Second floor basement.

1951
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:07,560
Lead the way.

1952
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,240
The dead don't have voices.

1953
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,320
Even if they did, we have to be quiet.

1954
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,080
Don't you worry about that.

1955
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:16,920
I have an idea.

1956
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:19,680
Let's just try it and you'll see how it works.

1957
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,860
This detective likes to just dive right into things.

1958
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:24,240
Even more than Lin does.

1959
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,280
I wonder if they're...

1960
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:28,000
Related.

1961
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:35,400
If they find me, I imagine they'll shoot first and ask questions later.

1962
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,380
Did they shoot Sausage Head?

1963
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:42,600
But if I die again, we can just start over, right?

1964
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:44,460
He says cheerfully.

1965
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:46,700
Prison secured.

1966
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:50,220
I don't know if you know it or not, but this is a special prison.

1967
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:53,360
There aren't any dangerous criminals here.

1968
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:54,700
Except for me, that is.

1969
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:58,420
Yes, I did hear something about it being a special place.

1970
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:00,840
Sausage Man is fine.

1971
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,740
He was in his cell.

1972
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,000
Oh, so if you leave the cell, they'll shoot.

1973
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:16,210
And because of the special status, they're not prepared at all for emergencies.

1974
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:20,390
They have four timid security guards at most.

1975
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:22,550
You would think that would make them...

1976
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:25,730
The fact that it's a special prison would make them more...

1977
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:27,830
Like, prepared.

1978
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:29,650
It's meant real.

1979
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:30,590
It's me!

1980
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:35,010
I think I saw some hunters lurking in the darkness, though.

1981
01:29:35,530 --> 01:29:36,670
Those are the guards.

1982
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:38,450
They're wearing night vision goggles.

1983
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:42,830
I wonder...

1984
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:45,030
Night vision goggles...

1985
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:46,390
Who...

1986
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:49,650
Who needs night vision goggles?

1987
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:51,910
You don't even need those.

1988
01:29:52,450 --> 01:29:53,850
What stupid...

1989
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:55,250
What a stupid invest...

1990
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:56,530
What a stupid thing to try...

1991
01:29:57,410 --> 01:29:58,630
Night vision goggles?

1992
01:29:58,930 --> 01:29:59,850
Like, who even...

1993
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:08,990
Night vision goggles.

1994
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:11,710
Night vision goggles.

1995
01:30:12,670 --> 01:30:15,450
They're special glasses that let you see in the dark.

1996
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:16,710
Very handy things.

1997
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:20,750
If I enter their field of vision, it's all over.

1998
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:24,510
So it's all about staying out of the guards' line of sight, eh?

1999
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:27,010
Make sure you guide me to safe spots.

2000
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:28,170
Like, under the table.

2001
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:30,130
Okay.

2002
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:34,590
Now about that signal I want you to give me.

2003
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:36,670
Yeah, how am I supposed to do it?

2004
01:30:37,450 --> 01:30:38,650
I've already been dead once.

2005
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:40,950
I don't know if it's because of that or what, but...

2006
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:42,750
I can sense your powers now.

2007
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:43,750
Ooh!

2008
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:46,090
You what?

2009
01:30:46,610 --> 01:30:49,290
For example, you're in the bunk right now, aren't you?

2010
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:50,930
Yeah?

2011
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:53,890
I guess you have a sixth sense.

2012
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,950
I think it's more like a detective sense.

2013
01:30:57,970 --> 01:30:59,430
That doesn't sound right somehow.

2014
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:02,690
Anyway, the details don't matter.

2015
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:04,590
Do you see this R here?

2016
01:31:05,570 --> 01:31:06,050
Yes.

2017
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:08,930
Where did that come from?

2018
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:13,330
Do you see this R button?

2019
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:13,730
Yes.

2020
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:14,150
Here?

2021
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:20,970
Snake, turn off the console.

2022
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:23,430
I mean, Raiden.

2023
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:24,770
Turn off the...

2024
01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:27,710
R button?

2025
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:31,330
Let's use it as our signal.

2026
01:31:32,210 --> 01:31:33,250
How will that work?

2027
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:35,590
If you press R, I'll sense it.

2028
01:31:35,730 --> 01:31:37,310
Then I'll move to wherever you are.

2029
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:39,810
So, for example...

2030
01:31:41,450 --> 01:31:42,370
A spoon?

2031
01:31:43,390 --> 01:31:45,410
If you move to that spoon and press R...

2032
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:46,470
I'll run to the spoon.

2033
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:47,430
Simple, right?

2034
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:49,210
All right.

2035
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:50,290
Fine.

2036
01:31:50,530 --> 01:31:51,870
Let's start our escape plan.

2037
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:55,170
Just make sure you guide me to safe spots, Cecil.

2038
01:31:58,730 --> 01:31:59,130
Ooh!

2039
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:01,850
So...

2040
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:03,390
Oh, okay.

2041
01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:08,170
What is...

2042
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:08,810
What is this part?

2043
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:10,590
Oh, bulletproof vest.

2044
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:11,030
Okay.

2045
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:12,830
All right.

2046
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:13,950
So, if I move here...

2047
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:17,470
And if I press R...

2048
01:32:18,850 --> 01:32:19,370
After...

2049
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:20,150
After this...

2050
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:21,030
After he turns around...

2051
01:32:24,690 --> 01:32:25,210
Wait!

2052
01:32:25,650 --> 01:32:26,550
Go under the table!

2053
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:27,790
What are you doing?

2054
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:32,250
He's gonna...

2055
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:33,250
See you.

2056
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:39,390
I was like, he's gonna...

2057
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:45,870
Check out what the enemy is doing.

2058
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:46,670
For now...

2059
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:48,630
How about just aiming for the neighboring cell?

2060
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:51,070
We can't hurry too much in this darkness.

2061
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:51,890
Let's take it slow.

2062
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:53,130
I tried!

2063
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:55,530
Chowed?

2064
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:56,410
Chowed?

2065
01:32:57,050 --> 01:32:57,610
Chowed!

2066
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:02,710
Oh, okay.

2067
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:04,130
Okay.

2068
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:07,870
What is this?

2069
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:09,610
Hatch mechanism.

2070
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:20,130
Interesting.

2071
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:23,530
Very interesting.

2072
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,570
There's another guy here.

2073
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:26,390
Interesting.

2074
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:27,330
Okay.

2075
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:30,730
Wait.

2076
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:31,970
So, if I like go here...

2077
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:32,850
I'm like, hey, come up here.

2078
01:33:35,330 --> 01:33:35,790
Wait.

2079
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:36,150
Where...

2080
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:37,150
Where's the end goal?

2081
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:37,990
Is my other thing.

2082
01:33:38,670 --> 01:33:39,890
Are we trying to...

2083
01:33:39,890 --> 01:33:41,290
He's in the neighboring cell.

2084
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:42,170
So...

2085
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:51,080
I feel like if I try to get him over to the toilet, it's too far.

2086
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:52,020
Unless...

2087
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:53,020
Unless I take him to the toilet.

2088
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:54,200
Unless I tell him to go all the way over here.

2089
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:58,000
Go.

2090
01:33:58,460 --> 01:33:58,820
Run.

2091
01:33:58,960 --> 01:33:59,060
Run.

2092
01:33:59,140 --> 01:33:59,260
Run.

2093
01:33:59,260 --> 01:33:59,400
Run.

2094
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:00,480
Oh.

2095
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:00,940
Nice.

2096
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:01,260
Nice.

2097
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:01,900
Nice.

2098
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:02,260
Nice.

2099
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:02,440
Nice.

2100
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:02,940
Okay.

2101
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:05,560
Okay.

2102
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:05,980
Okay.

2103
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:06,420
So...

2104
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:06,860
Oh!

2105
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:07,360
Oh!

2106
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:08,240
There's another guy.

2107
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:11,200
Where'd you come from?

2108
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:15,280
Oh, yeah.

2109
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:15,720
Oh.

2110
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:16,240
I have to...

2111
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,580
I have to wait for him to come back.

2112
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:23,170
He's going up the stairs?

2113
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:24,410
Oh.

2114
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:25,070
I can't see.

2115
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:27,170
Oh.

2116
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:29,250
He's going...

2117
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:32,030
All the way up.

2118
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:32,770
Look at him go.

2119
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:37,510
He's going down the stairs?

2120
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:38,950
He's...

2121
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:40,730
Back to where we are?

2122
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:42,070
Okay.

2123
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:46,600
Let's follow him.

2124
01:34:51,330 --> 01:34:53,390
What do we have?

2125
01:34:54,110 --> 01:34:55,130
What is that?

2126
01:34:55,930 --> 01:34:56,870
What is that?

2127
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:58,370
Oh, that's the cover of the toilet.

2128
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:01,350
Let's see where he's going.

2129
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:02,190
Let's see where he goes, actually.

2130
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:03,690
Is there anything over here?

2131
01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:06,270
There's...

2132
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:08,510
What the...

2133
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:09,790
Is that a guy lying down?

2134
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:10,850
Oh, my God.

2135
01:35:11,190 --> 01:35:11,670
What?

2136
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:12,450
He scared me.

2137
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:16,510
What is that?

2138
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:19,310
Oh, there's a guy in between.

2139
01:35:23,930 --> 01:35:24,610
What's this?

2140
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:25,310
Oh.

2141
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:26,370
Empty can.

2142
01:35:27,570 --> 01:35:27,810
Hmm.

2143
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:30,630
This area under the stairs is a blind spot for the guards.

2144
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:32,210
They won't find him here.

2145
01:35:32,290 --> 01:35:33,030
This spot is safe.

2146
01:35:33,130 --> 01:35:33,370
Oh.

2147
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:34,030
Okay.

2148
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:37,990
We have to wait for him to...

2149
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:41,950
We have to wait for him to...

2150
01:35:41,950 --> 01:35:42,970
Will he...

2151
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:43,970
Oh, gosh.

2152
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:45,970
We'll have to start from the very beginning, though, if we...

2153
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:47,730
Okay.

2154
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:50,370
Will he, like, walk behind the guards, you know?

2155
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:55,700
So, if I'm like, go...

2156
01:35:59,000 --> 01:35:59,400
Go...

2157
01:35:59,400 --> 01:35:59,860
Now.

2158
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:02,140
Ow!

2159
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:04,720
Wait.

2160
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:05,120
How...

2161
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,800
How do you see him?

2162
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:07,800
Okay.

2163
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,080
What just happened?

2164
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,980
Apparently, there was a hunter lurking in the ceiling.

2165
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,160
Could you do something about him?

2166
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:18,240
It's so dark, I can't even see the bullet coming.

2167
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:22,500
He dodged the bullet if it wasn't dark?

2168
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:29,170
Okay.

2169
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:30,030
Okay.

2170
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:30,430
Okay.

2171
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:31,490
Wait.

2172
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:32,330
Is this the very beginning?

2173
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:33,410
Oh, man.

2174
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:36,350
Oh, man.

2175
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:37,170
Okay.

2176
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:37,550
Okay.

2177
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:37,890
Okay.

2178
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:38,390
Okay.

2179
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:39,970
Close.

2180
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:42,510
I think...

2181
01:36:42,990 --> 01:36:43,510
Oh, wait.

2182
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:43,930
Open.

2183
01:36:44,010 --> 01:36:44,590
I'm gonna...

2184
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:46,830
I'm going to open this up.

2185
01:36:47,190 --> 01:36:52,010
I'm gonna open up this little mechanism in the meantime, because I feel like we're gonna need it later.

2186
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:54,130
Unless...

2187
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:57,110
Did me opening that open all the other ones?

2188
01:36:58,270 --> 01:36:58,670
Hmm.

2189
01:36:58,730 --> 01:36:59,590
I don't think so.

2190
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:01,190
Mint is so cute.

2191
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:02,450
What do you mean?

2192
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:03,770
What do you mean?

2193
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:05,930
Go.

2194
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:17,370
Run.

2195
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:17,530
Run.

2196
01:37:17,670 --> 01:37:17,810
Run.

2197
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:18,030
Run.

2198
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:18,210
Run.

2199
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:18,370
Run.

2200
01:37:18,370 --> 01:37:18,470
Run.

2201
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:18,610
Run.

2202
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:18,670
Run.

2203
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:18,770
Run.

2204
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:18,970
Run.

2205
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:19,070
Okay.

2206
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:20,050
Very good.

2207
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:20,710
All right.

2208
01:37:20,730 --> 01:37:21,730
Now, this guy is walking back.

2209
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:22,730
Oh, my gosh.

2210
01:37:22,810 --> 01:37:23,550
What if I had gone?

2211
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:25,730
And...

2212
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:26,410
Oh.

2213
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:26,690
No.

2214
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:26,970
Wait.

2215
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:27,450
Come back.

2216
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:27,650
Come back.

2217
01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:27,770
Come back.

2218
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:27,990
I

2219
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:32,180
forgot.

2220
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:34,100
I need to attach myself to him.

2221
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:35,820
Whoopsie.

2222
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:37,800
It's okay.

2223
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:38,660
I can drink my water.

2224
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:45,160
Whenever I make oatmeal, I make it in a mug.

2225
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:49,360
And then afterwards, I make tea in the same mug.

2226
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:51,540
And so, it's like kind of an oatmeal...

2227
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:52,280
Oatmeal.

2228
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:53,160
Like...

2229
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,140
Because I like oat milk.

2230
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:56,080
So, it's like an oatmeal drink.

2231
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:57,620
It's so good.

2232
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,080
Mug meal.

2233
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:03,100
It's actually so yummy.

2234
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:05,400
I see the vision.

2235
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:06,780
Yeah.

2236
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:07,680
So, it's like an oat.

2237
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,680
It becomes like an oat-flavored tea.

2238
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:13,180
What a weirdo.

2239
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:14,220
You're the weirdo.

2240
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:15,860
How do I...

2241
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:16,140
Oh.

2242
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:17,000
How do I attach...

2243
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,480
How do I get to the hatch?

2244
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:26,220
Maybe now.

2245
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:26,700
Oh.

2246
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:31,780
A valve.

2247
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:34,920
Open?

2248
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:35,420
Wait.

2249
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:36,960
Oop.

2250
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:43,100
Oh, now they're both walking.

2251
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:43,540
Hello?

2252
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,120
Okay, wait.

2253
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:48,700
Wait, this doesn't...

2254
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:51,760
Oh, I wish I could like drop this on his head but it's a valve.

2255
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:53,940
Wait.

2256
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,560
This doesn't seem very good.

2257
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:56,540
Oh, wait.

2258
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:56,700
Oh, I don't know.

2259
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:57,420
Wait...

2260
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:00,840
Does he just walk back up and close it again or...

2261
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:03,320
Hold on, let's see what happens here.

2262
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:10,240
What's he doing?

2263
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:20,600
He's going all the way up!

2264
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:22,920
I'm stuck here, actually.

2265
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:25,260
If I close this, does he lay back down?

2266
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:42,980
Uh, whoopsie!

2267
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:45,960
Oh, this one's tough though.

2268
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:55,760
The timing on this is really rough.

2269
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:58,460
I think...

2270
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:00,060
Oh, he fell again!

2271
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:06,850
He fell again.

2272
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:08,790
Okay.

2273
01:40:09,930 --> 01:40:10,730
Maybe...

2274
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:12,030
Now.

2275
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:17,510
Oh my god, that was so close!

2276
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:21,290
Holy cow, that was so close!

2277
01:40:21,290 --> 01:40:22,210
Oh gosh.

2278
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:25,110
Okay, okay, okay.

2279
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:28,030
Oh, man.

2280
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:28,050
Oh, man.

2281
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:44,290
We're gonna close that up so he stops dropping.

2282
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,420
Come on, I can't reach you!

2283
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:53,000
Come a little closer.

2284
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,000
Get close to Minto.

2285
01:40:59,060 --> 01:40:59,920
What the...

2286
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,260
Oh, I was like, hello?

2287
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:09,810
Oh, wait.

2288
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:11,830
Oh, I followed the wrong guy!

2289
01:41:12,230 --> 01:41:13,250
I don't...

2290
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:14,270
Stop!

2291
01:41:14,270 --> 01:41:14,410
Stop!

2292
01:41:17,450 --> 01:41:18,050
Close.

2293
01:41:18,850 --> 01:41:19,910
Oh, some...

2294
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:21,930
I can't close this right now.

2295
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:23,590
Somebody's falling through it.

2296
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:27,750
Okay, now we can close it.

2297
01:41:29,010 --> 01:41:30,930
Where should we go next though?

2298
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:33,730
Where can he hide next?

2299
01:41:39,230 --> 01:41:39,830
Wastebasket.

2300
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:41,270
Toilet.

2301
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:44,930
There's like nothing here.

2302
01:41:48,090 --> 01:41:48,750
Hmm.

2303
01:41:55,010 --> 01:41:56,790
Okay, he should come over here.

2304
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:01,440
Not yet.

2305
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:06,290
Like, here?

2306
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:07,410
Okay, okay, okay.

2307
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:07,990
There we go.

2308
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:12,490
Wait, where do I go?

2309
01:42:14,930 --> 01:42:16,370
This part is tricky.

2310
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:23,900
The valve seems important.

2311
01:42:25,170 --> 01:42:26,480
But the valve...

2312
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:29,020
I can't do any ghost trick to it.

2313
01:42:36,330 --> 01:42:37,970
He just stops right there?

2314
01:42:40,630 --> 01:42:42,610
Oh no, he keeps going, he keeps going.

2315
01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:45,910
Where are we going?

2316
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:49,870
Are you kidding me?

2317
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:55,880
Oh boy.

2318
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:57,340
No way.

2319
01:42:58,260 --> 01:42:59,360
No way!

2320
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:04,460
No way, I have to go all the way?

2321
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:06,140
Over there?

2322
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:07,960
No...

2323
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:09,200
Is that real?

2324
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:11,260
Yes way?

2325
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,720
Chat, is this real?

2326
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:35,170
There's nothing...

2327
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:37,190
Unless...

2328
01:43:37,190 --> 01:43:41,070
Unless the valve...

2329
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:47,510
Unless... maybe if he hides in the ceiling, will they still see him?

2330
01:43:49,850 --> 01:43:52,150
Maybe they won't see him if he hides in the ceiling.

2331
01:43:54,930 --> 01:43:58,530
Okay, I'm gonna have to wait for somebody to come rescue me from the bunk.

2332
01:44:00,130 --> 01:44:03,070
Come rescue me from the bunk, please.

2333
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:04,330
Keep going.

2334
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:05,330
Walk.

2335
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:06,770
Come here, boy.

2336
01:44:07,970 --> 01:44:08,450
Yeah.

2337
01:44:09,010 --> 01:44:09,650
That's right.

2338
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:14,970
You know what?

2339
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:17,810
It's better to try that than trying nothing at all.

2340
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:19,850
Let's go to the valve.

2341
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:25,520
And just sit in here, wondering.

2342
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:26,620
You know?

2343
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:28,340
If we die, we just get here again.

2344
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,760
If we die, we just...

2345
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:33,100
trick our way back.

2346
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:34,960
Oh wait.

2347
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:36,280
Uh...

2348
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:36,940
Uh...

2349
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:37,220
Uh...

2350
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:38,540
Trick...

2351
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:38,820
Oh!

2352
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:39,600
No, no, no, no!

2353
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:41,920
You invited me to come get you.

2354
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:42,640
I'm sorry.

2355
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:44,360
Sorry.

2356
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:47,400
Not bad.

2357
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:50,220
My bad.

2358
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:51,460
Don't do that.

2359
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:53,160
Okay.

2360
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:54,580
Okay.

2361
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:55,060
Here.

2362
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:04,440
Okay, he's gonna go down.

2363
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:07,900
And while he's walking away...

2364
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:09,440
He's walking that way.

2365
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:14,760
He's gonna go...

2366
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:17,760
Okay.

2367
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:18,540
Go, go, go!

2368
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,600
What do you want me to climb up into the ceiling?

2369
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,220
I think I can manage that.

2370
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,220
But as things stand, I don't have a...

2371
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:27,240
Oh no!

2372
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:31,820
Could you open that hatch and create an entry point for me?

2373
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:33,400
Oh!

2374
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:34,860
You lost your chance!

2375
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:35,460
Oh wait!

2376
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:39,100
Maybe actually this guy will be stuck on this side.

2377
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:40,460
What?

2378
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:41,280
Okay.

2379
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:42,540
Okay, now...

2380
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:45,720
Wait.

2381
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:46,660
He's turning around!

2382
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:47,840
Oh no!

2383
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:48,720
He's going to get seen.

2384
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:52,440
Is this guy going to fall through the floor?

2385
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,560
I should have... Yeah, no time.

2386
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,800
Mmm... This guy's going to fall through the floor.

2387
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:05,140
There we go.

2388
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:08,160
Okay.

2389
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:09,840
Let's close the hatch.

2390
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:17,660
Wait, they're both going up now.

2391
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:21,000
Oh, but one will continue going up and one will turn around.

2392
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:24,060
Okay.

2393
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:28,180
Alright, as soon as he's passed.

2394
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:30,140
Thank you!

2395
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:31,580
As soon as he's passed.

2396
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:34,840
Oh gosh, the timing on this is like...

2397
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,920
Why do you have to stop right there, man?

2398
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:44,960
There's no time!

2399
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,160
There's no time!

2400
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:53,360
Made some delicious al dente parmesan and cheddar cheese pasta with broccoli and chicken.

2401
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:54,680
Please stop.

2402
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:56,380
I'm so hungry.

2403
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:58,320
I even perfected my roux.

2404
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:00,240
I added some red pepper flakes.

2405
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:02,360
It was really good.

2406
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:03,880
Mint streams give me energy.

2407
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,020
That sounds amazing.

2408
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,680
Oh, also, Yanwei, I forgot to answer.

2409
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:10,160
My favorite instant curry...

2410
01:47:11,060 --> 01:47:13,740
I actually really like the...

2411
01:47:15,020 --> 01:47:15,500
Um...

2412
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:18,040
I really like...

2413
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:20,140
I don't remember the brand, actually.

2414
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:21,840
Hold on.

2415
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:22,680
Let me look it up.

2416
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,380
I've actually never tried the Vermont curry before, but I like...

2417
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:29,700
Apple curry.

2418
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:34,620
It's a golden curry.

2419
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:36,180
The golden curry one.

2420
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:40,340
I like it.

2421
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:44,120
But I've never had the Vermont...

2422
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:45,980
But I just add my own apples to it.

2423
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:47,540
Golden.

2424
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:48,660
I'll try that next time.

2425
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:49,300
Yeah!

2426
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:52,540
Whenever I make curry, I use the golden curry.

2427
01:47:56,020 --> 01:47:56,540
Oh!

2428
01:47:57,880 --> 01:47:58,400
Geez!

2429
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:00,660
Oh!

2430
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:01,060
Geez!

2431
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:03,020
We're not gonna...

2432
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:06,300
Maybe I have to...

2433
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:11,240
Maybe I have to close this.

2434
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:13,180
Again.

2435
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:17,000
Because he's gonna come back.

2436
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:19,700
I don't want him to fall down the stairs.

2437
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:23,980
There he is.

2438
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:27,120
And he goes down.

2439
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,380
And he goes down.

2440
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:28,380
What?

2441
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:29,580
The timing on this is whack!

2442
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:33,160
The timing on this is so whack!

2443
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:39,160
Because he immediately turns around, but this guy stops here.

2444
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:40,820
Yeah!

2445
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:54,440
The timing was okay before you dropped him.

2446
01:48:54,580 --> 01:48:54,720
The timing was okay before you dropped him.

2447
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:55,300
Maybe, yeah.

2448
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:57,800
Okay.

2449
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:58,320
Okay.

2450
01:48:58,360 --> 01:48:58,820
Maybe...

2451
01:48:59,360 --> 01:48:59,620
Nope.

2452
01:48:59,700 --> 01:48:59,980
Nope.

2453
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:00,200
Nope.

2454
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:00,320
Nope.

2455
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:06,060
Maybe I do need to drop him again.

2456
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:07,840
To reset the timing.

2457
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:12,000
Maybe this will help reset the timing.

2458
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:12,480
Actually.

2459
01:49:23,110 --> 01:49:23,550
Okay.

2460
01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:28,430
This is a bit better.

2461
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:29,450
This is a bit better.

2462
01:49:29,530 --> 01:49:29,690
Okay.

2463
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:29,950
Okay.

2464
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:30,190
Okay.

2465
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:32,370
Walk.

2466
01:49:33,270 --> 01:49:33,710
Walk.

2467
01:49:33,770 --> 01:49:34,030
Walk.

2468
01:49:34,030 --> 01:49:34,210
Walk.

2469
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:34,450
Nice!

2470
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:35,050
Okay.

2471
01:49:36,490 --> 01:49:36,930
Trick.

2472
01:49:36,930 --> 01:49:37,750
And then...

2473
01:49:38,350 --> 01:49:38,790
Here.

2474
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:39,450
Here.

2475
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:40,870
And then...

2476
01:49:40,870 --> 01:49:41,470
Just go.

2477
01:49:41,530 --> 01:49:41,810
Just go.

2478
01:49:41,910 --> 01:49:42,270
Go!

2479
01:49:46,890 --> 01:49:47,770
Oh my god.

2480
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:48,510
That scared me.

2481
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:55,190
I just can't seem to find the brick I need!

2482
01:49:55,910 --> 01:49:57,270
And you'll just have to make one.

2483
01:49:57,610 --> 01:49:58,130
Make one?

2484
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:03,450
Try calling me to all kinds of different places.

2485
01:50:04,230 --> 01:50:04,950
I'm agreeable.

2486
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:06,010
I can go pretty much anywhere.

2487
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:10,480
Okay.

2488
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:12,580
I can see why you guys said this is not a good level.

2489
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:14,740
No, we have to...

2490
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:15,080
Wait!

2491
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:16,200
Oh, thank goodness.

2492
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:17,740
We don't have to start at the very beginning.

2493
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:19,200
Yeah!

2494
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:21,280
The game is kind to us.

2495
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:21,740
Okay.

2496
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:25,560
Oops.

2497
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:27,840
Okay.

2498
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:28,160
Good.

2499
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:28,420
Good.

2500
01:50:32,430 --> 01:50:33,290
Come over here.

2501
01:50:37,070 --> 01:50:38,050
Oh, and it's closed.

2502
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:38,810
Okay.

2503
01:50:46,430 --> 01:50:46,850
Wait.

2504
01:50:46,910 --> 01:50:48,150
This might actually be it.

2505
01:50:49,290 --> 01:50:49,710
Wait.

2506
01:50:49,710 --> 01:50:49,710
This might actually be it.

2507
01:50:53,910 --> 01:50:54,390
Wait.

2508
01:50:54,770 --> 01:50:55,650
This might be it.

2509
01:51:12,490 --> 01:51:14,270
Now close the hatch.

2510
01:51:17,870 --> 01:51:19,290
They won't see him now, right?

2511
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:32,540
I love making super spicy curry with pineapple in it because the sweet mix with the heat is great.

2512
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:35,860
But if I'm not sweating while eating curry, it feels wrong.

2513
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,840
I can't have spicy, so...

2514
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:39,540
No.

2515
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:41,180
I like sweet curry.

2516
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:43,620
But pineapple curry sounds pretty good too.

2517
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:46,920
That's the most precise part?

2518
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:47,360
Okay.

2519
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:51,180
So now...

2520
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:54,440
Oh, it's so scary.

2521
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:05,300
Oh, wait.

2522
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:06,000
No, no, no.

2523
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:06,320
Stop!

2524
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:07,660
Cancel, cancel, cancel.

2525
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:12,480
Oh, wait.

2526
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:13,780
No, I need to get to the...

2527
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:16,400
I need to get to the...

2528
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:16,780
Okay.

2529
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:17,340
Wait.

2530
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:19,720
I have to open this though, don't I?

2531
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:23,060
I have to open this.

2532
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:25,380
I have to open this.

2533
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:26,380
Yeah, now we make him fall.

2534
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:26,860
Wait.

2535
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:27,360
No, no, no.

2536
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:27,840
Wait.

2537
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:29,200
Okay.

2538
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:35,100
I have to be like super good timing because I have to open this.

2539
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:37,180
Wait, I don't have to open it?

2540
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:39,500
Oh, I don't?

2541
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,540
Okay, let's just go to the bunk then.

2542
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:42,740
Just roll?

2543
01:52:43,180 --> 01:52:43,620
Oh.

2544
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:44,940
Okay.

2545
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:47,860
Wait a second.

2546
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:51,040
Oh, well, if I get him over here...

2547
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:53,360
There's nowhere else to go from here.

2548
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:54,640
So...

2549
01:52:58,260 --> 01:52:58,840
Oh, wait!

2550
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:00,040
Come back, come back, come back!

2551
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:00,740
Sorry.

2552
01:53:07,050 --> 01:53:07,930
Maybe, actually...

2553
01:53:07,930 --> 01:53:09,990
He can go over here.

2554
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:12,750
Um...

2555
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:16,130
There's nowhere like down here to lead him to though.

2556
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:20,790
This guy turns around eventually.

2557
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:21,090
Right?

2558
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:24,170
A good...

2559
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:27,370
A good officer would turn around and check his back.

2560
01:53:29,170 --> 01:53:33,570
A good officer would turn around and make sure no one's sneaking up on him in the dark.

2561
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:40,680
Check the wall.

2562
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:52,300
No!

2563
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:53,840
Okay,

2564
01:53:57,390 --> 01:53:57,970
okay, okay.

2565
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:02,930
Can I like tell him to come over here?

2566
01:54:18,130 --> 01:54:18,530
Now?

2567
01:54:30,270 --> 01:54:30,870
Turn around.

2568
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:31,450
Oh my god.

2569
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:32,570
Yeah!

2570
01:54:33,070 --> 01:54:35,110
Oh my god, please, sir.

2571
01:54:35,190 --> 01:54:35,570
Please.

2572
01:54:37,090 --> 01:54:38,590
If I move now, I'm going to fall.

2573
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:39,710
Could you close the hatch for me?

2574
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:40,730
Yes, yes, yes!

2575
01:54:42,330 --> 01:54:43,450
Can't you just jump?

2576
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:47,550
Okay, now go?

2577
01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:49,670
Go?

2578
01:54:49,890 --> 01:54:50,550
Please go.

2579
01:54:52,610 --> 01:54:53,670
So, what do you think?

2580
01:54:54,690 --> 01:54:57,170
I'd say if we've come this far, we did it.

2581
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:58,350
Great job, Cecil.

2582
01:55:02,990 --> 01:55:04,970
The basement generator has been repaired.

2583
01:55:05,290 --> 01:55:06,870
Restoring power to all areas.

2584
01:55:09,730 --> 01:55:10,210
Oh.

2585
01:55:10,210 --> 01:55:10,830
Uh-oh.

2586
01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:12,490
Uh-oh.

2587
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:17,960
Run!

2588
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:21,280
Don't just stand there.

2589
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:25,340
But the question is, what now?

2590
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:28,380
I don't have anywhere else to... anywhere to go, do I?

2591
01:55:28,540 --> 01:55:29,860
Maybe I'll go back to my cell.

2592
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:31,440
You better be kidding!

2593
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,500
But I'm still a condemned criminal, you know.

2594
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:37,840
I doubt anybody would welcome me with open arms.

2595
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:39,760
I doubt anybody would welcome me with open arms.

2596
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:41,080
Why don't you try contacting Lin?

2597
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:41,520
Why don't you try contacting Lin?

2598
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:44,360
She went to see some justice minister guy.

2599
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:49,320
So an escaped death row convict is supposed to just report in to the justice minister?

2600
01:55:49,580 --> 01:55:49,660
So an escaped death row convict is supposed to just report in to the justice minister?

2601
01:55:49,660 --> 01:55:50,280
Is that it?

2602
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:52,260
I kinda like that.

2603
01:55:53,140 --> 01:55:53,840
Hello, Minto.

2604
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:54,580
Good luck with game.

2605
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:55,400
Love your stream.

2606
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:56,440
Thank you!

2607
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:57,820
Thanks, Coldbreed!

2608
01:55:58,560 --> 01:55:59,480
Thanks for a whole month.

2609
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:03,260
You have yet to be kidding me.

2610
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:04,260
You have yet to be kidding me.

2611
01:56:05,140 --> 01:56:06,480
That would be nice, yes.

2612
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:07,840
Alright, Sissel.

2613
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:08,820
Until we meet again.

2614
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:12,520
Wait, how does he escape from the prison, though?

2615
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:13,120
Wait, how does he escape from the prison, though?

2616
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:15,160
There's still other doors with other people.

2617
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:16,360
There's still other doors with other people.

2618
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:18,060
Oh well.

2619
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:23,170
Let's just not think about that part.

2620
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:28,020
Yes.

2621
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:34,400
Now I've saved a condemned criminal's life and helped him escape.

2622
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:36,300
Is that really the right thing to do?

2623
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:38,980
I guess all I can do is believe in Lin at this point.

2624
01:56:40,020 --> 01:56:41,320
I guess all I can do is believe in Lin at this point.

2625
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:42,520
Why is there a big boss?

2626
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:46,900
That's why you're the best boss!

2627
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:48,120
Great job sneaking!

2628
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:50,600
That's why you're the best boss!

2629
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:50,600
Great job sneaking!

2630
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:51,140
Thank you!

2631
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:57,720
Oh, all four guards were at the cells.

2632
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:58,500
No one was upstairs.

2633
01:56:58,740 --> 01:56:59,640
Oh, that makes sense.

2634
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:03,300
Detective Joud was painting my picture in his cell.

2635
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:04,200
He knows me.

2636
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:05,900
I'm sure I'll be talking to him again.

2637
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:08,620
Well then, why doesn't he even say something?

2638
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:10,680
Hmm...

2639
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:11,060
Thank you!

2640
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:11,520
Thank you!

2641
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:12,120
Chu!

2642
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:20,360
Real military-grade NVG doesn't emit anything because it'd be easy to detect.

2643
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:20,900
Real military-grade NVG doesn't emit anything because it'd be easy to detect.

2644
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:21,360
Real military-grade NVG doesn't emit anything because it'd be easy to detect.

2645
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:23,720
It's all passive light amplification with tech.

2646
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:26,540
I don't understand it, so it might as well be magic.

2647
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:26,860
I don't understand it, so it might as well be magic.

2648
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:29,640
Yeah, right?

2649
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:31,600
If you think about it, it's kinda like...

2650
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:33,240
It's like...

2651
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:38,820
Yeah, it would be pointless to use it if you could see through a whole trail of light, right?

2652
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:40,540
That'd be so silly.

2653
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:44,760
Let's go to...

2654
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:47,800
Let's go to the guard room.

2655
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:49,720
The mortuary...

2656
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:52,720
Anybody here?

2657
01:57:55,820 --> 01:57:56,640
Did you hear?

2658
01:57:58,340 --> 01:58:01,620
Yeah, we're supposed to repair this thing by the time they catch him again.

2659
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:05,420
But I wonder why he escaped.

2660
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:06,500
Hmm...

2661
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:08,280
But it's so cool!

2662
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:11,260
What, the light in the dark?

2663
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:11,840
I agree.

2664
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:15,080
The trail of light is like so awesome.

2665
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:21,440
Splinter Cell misled a lot of people on artistic decision.

2666
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:24,380
Aesthetic-wise, it looks great.

2667
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:26,260
Practicality?

2668
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:27,220
Not so much.

2669
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:29,360
Reminds me of Godot.

2670
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:32,680
I mean...

2671
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:35,400
But that's like not night vision.

2672
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:40,000
And his mask emitting light is like...

2673
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:42,960
Kind of a big thing.

2674
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:46,760
I wonder why he escaped.

2675
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:49,420
I heard Detective Joud wanted the death penalty.

2676
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:50,660
Right.

2677
01:58:50,780 --> 01:58:52,420
It's not like him to change his mind.

2678
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:55,300
Maybe on this final night of his...

2679
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:57,360
He just got a voice in his head or something.

2680
01:58:57,720 --> 01:58:58,380
It was me!

2681
01:58:58,740 --> 01:58:59,740
Yeah, me.

2682
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:02,000
Maybe it told him to run.

2683
01:59:02,700 --> 01:59:03,920
Are they talking about me?

2684
01:59:05,020 --> 01:59:06,680
What kind of a voice do you think it was?

2685
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:08,260
You know...

2686
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:10,040
Something evil.

2687
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:13,920
If you ever have Minto voice in your head...

2688
01:59:15,380 --> 01:59:16,420
Something evil.

2689
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:18,180
Like a devil.

2690
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:19,920
Or a demon or something.

2691
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,460
Maybe a g-g-g-g-ghost?

2692
01:59:23,020 --> 01:59:25,060
I picture something with a pointy head.

2693
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:25,940
Wearing sunglasses.

2694
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:27,940
Something like that.

2695
01:59:28,830 --> 01:59:30,600
They ARE talking about me.

2696
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,140
Can they see me?

2697
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:35,840
Trick time.

2698
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:38,340
That's so silly.

2699
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:43,460
Alright.

2700
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:44,700
Guard room.

2701
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:50,640
Hey, how they know about your...

2702
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:51,680
Pointy ghost head thing?

2703
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,860
I don't know.

2704
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:57,760
Sixth sense, I guess.

2705
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:01,820
But Detective Jouds, until we meet again...

2706
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:03,300
Came around quicker than I expected.

2707
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:05,280
When I got back to the guard room...

2708
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,360
The next fateful call came in.

2709
02:00:13,980 --> 02:00:15,360
It's the panic dance.

2710
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:16,680
Hello, this is...

2711
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:16,780
Oh!

2712
02:00:18,580 --> 02:00:19,700
Sizzle, are you there?

2713
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:22,160
H-hello?

2714
02:00:25,660 --> 02:00:28,680
Oh, I'm not talking to you, officer.

2715
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:30,820
Anyway, if you're there, Sizzle...

2716
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:31,700
Come here immediately.

2717
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:34,260
I'll be waiting for you.

2718
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:35,860
If you make it in time, that is.

2719
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:37,860
Wait a minute!

2720
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:38,800
Oh my god.

2721
02:00:40,280 --> 02:00:41,940
Go, go, go, Sizzle!

2722
02:00:48,230 --> 02:00:48,770
Oh, wait.

2723
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:49,910
Dial, dial!

2724
02:00:50,270 --> 02:00:53,190
I kinda wanna see what...

2725
02:00:53,630 --> 02:00:55,110
Officer Bailey has to say.

2726
02:00:57,550 --> 02:00:58,150
That call!

2727
02:00:58,410 --> 02:00:59,250
Who is it from?

2728
02:01:00,250 --> 02:01:00,890
I don't know.

2729
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:01,870
Some weird call.

2730
02:01:02,630 --> 02:01:03,770
Ah, but who...

2731
02:01:03,770 --> 02:01:06,250
Will call an end to my dancing!

2732
02:01:09,090 --> 02:01:10,730
You're supposed to record it.

2733
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:13,510
Yeah, well, once you get going like that...

2734
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:15,010
I'm not gonna stop you.

2735
02:01:15,690 --> 02:01:17,110
It's a contest then!

2736
02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:19,030
Which will stop first?

2737
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:21,950
My dancing, or the turning of the planet?

2738
02:01:26,910 --> 02:01:28,370
Yeah, good luck with that.

2739
02:01:30,690 --> 02:01:31,270
Alrighty.

2740
02:01:31,270 --> 02:01:32,950
External line.

2741
02:01:34,270 --> 02:01:35,510
Go to...

2742
02:01:36,490 --> 02:01:37,130
Oh.

2743
02:01:38,850 --> 02:01:39,910
Go to here.

2744
02:01:40,590 --> 02:01:42,590
Wherever this mysterious place is.

2745
02:01:44,550 --> 02:01:44,890
Meow.

2746
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:45,990
Meow.

2747
02:01:50,190 --> 02:01:50,830
Whoa.

2748
02:01:53,950 --> 02:01:56,150
On the other end of the telephone line...

2749
02:01:56,150 --> 02:01:57,450
The scene that greets me...

2750
02:01:57,450 --> 02:01:59,010
Tells me one simple fact.

2751
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:00,830
Is Lynn dead?

2752
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:03,150
Holy cow.

2753
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:03,950
The soundtrack.

2754
02:02:08,090 --> 02:02:10,930
That our great escape plan...

2755
02:02:10,930 --> 02:02:11,950
Has ended in failure.

2756
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:16,530
Never expected to see you here...

2757
02:02:16,530 --> 02:02:17,730
Inspector Cabanela.

2758
02:02:18,970 --> 02:02:20,370
I believe...

2759
02:02:20,370 --> 02:02:22,390
That's my line, old friend.

2760
02:02:23,290 --> 02:02:24,970
What were you doing here?

2761
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:27,490
Believe...

2762
02:02:27,490 --> 02:02:29,330
That's my line too.

2763
02:02:29,450 --> 02:02:29,890
Clear.

2764
02:02:30,830 --> 02:02:30,890
Hahaha.

2765
02:02:35,860 --> 02:02:37,160
I came to...

2766
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:38,520
Attend your execution.

2767
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:40,960
They told me what time it was.

2768
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:43,320
Couldn't get into the chamber...

2769
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:45,760
So I was observing a moment of silence here.

2770
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:48,220
And when I looked up my eyes...

2771
02:02:48,220 --> 02:02:49,380
Full of tears...

2772
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:50,680
There you were, baby.

2773
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:53,640
You're so adorkable.

2774
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:54,400
What am I doing?

2775
02:02:55,140 --> 02:02:56,840
Why am I adorkable though?

2776
02:03:02,990 --> 02:03:04,170
It's just the way...

2777
02:03:04,170 --> 02:03:05,030
Things turned out.

2778
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:05,190
Well...

2779
02:03:05,190 --> 02:03:08,310
I took part in what seemed like a fun game...

2780
02:03:08,310 --> 02:03:09,130
And here I am.

2781
02:03:10,890 --> 02:03:12,850
Here's what I wish, my old friend.

2782
02:03:13,710 --> 02:03:15,450
Wish it was anybody but me...

2783
02:03:15,450 --> 02:03:16,350
Who found you here.

2784
02:03:18,210 --> 02:03:19,430
What does he mean by that?

2785
02:03:20,590 --> 02:03:21,870
He is gonna shoot him?

2786
02:03:22,570 --> 02:03:24,590
Cause now that I've found you, man...

2787
02:03:24,590 --> 02:03:25,750
I have to turn you in.

2788
02:03:27,270 --> 02:03:29,930
You have to stay spotlessly clean after all.

2789
02:03:31,190 --> 02:03:31,670
You

2790
02:03:35,340 --> 02:03:35,820
have to stay spotlessly clean after all.

2791
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:36,360
You have to stay spotlessly clean after all.

2792
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:36,820
Thanks for coming.

2793
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:38,920
I wanted to say goodbye to you.

2794
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:40,660
Cause you are adorable.

2795
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:41,640
What did I do?

2796
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:45,520
As you can see...

2797
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:47,420
I guess I'm not going to be much help to you.

2798
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:49,780
What's going to happen to you?

2799
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:52,700
Being executed tonight...

2800
02:03:52,700 --> 02:03:55,060
Is just about the only thing on my schedule, it seems.

2801
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:56,260
No, no...

2802
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:57,740
There must be something we can trick too.

2803
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:00,140
Executed, huh?

2804
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:02,460
Death is pretty much meaningless to me.

2805
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:03,820
Anyway...

2806
02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:05,340
I guess we'll be seeing each other again.

2807
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:08,100
By the way...

2808
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:09,520
There's something I'm looking for.

2809
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:11,160
That's right.

2810
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:12,080
Your lost memory.

2811
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:15,100
You know things I'd like to know.

2812
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:17,140
Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?

2813
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:20,720
In return for tonight's fun little game.

2814
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:21,220
Is that it?

2815
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:23,220
Oh...

2816
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:26,980
Let's ask about the execution.

2817
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:28,480
Let's go down to up.

2818
02:04:28,820 --> 02:04:29,680
Thank you, thank you.

2819
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:30,760
Chuuu...

2820
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:34,240
Mint is indeed cute.

2821
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:36,420
Stop!

2822
02:04:36,980 --> 02:04:38,080
Someone's about to die.

2823
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:39,500
And we're talking about me.

2824
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:42,520
This is not how it should be.

2825
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:47,400
Someone's about to die.

2826
02:04:48,260 --> 02:04:49,880
And all you think about is anime.

2827
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:51,700
What's wrong with you?

2828
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:53,100
What's wrong with you?

2829
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:55,720
Someone's about to die and you think about anime.

2830
02:04:56,360 --> 02:04:57,100
Anime girl!

2831
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:00,560
How could you think about anime at a time like this?

2832
02:05:09,790 --> 02:05:10,970
Is your execution...

2833
02:05:10,970 --> 02:05:11,950
really the right thing to do?

2834
02:05:12,710 --> 02:05:13,930
I had a fair trial.

2835
02:05:14,130 --> 02:05:15,130
And that's what was decided.

2836
02:05:15,490 --> 02:05:16,570
No problem there.

2837
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:18,650
But still...

2838
02:05:19,670 --> 02:05:21,770
This is the punishment that I should receive.

2839
02:05:22,590 --> 02:05:24,150
What if anime girl is cute?

2840
02:05:24,290 --> 02:05:25,590
It doesn't matter!

2841
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:29,910
If I was about to die...

2842
02:05:29,910 --> 02:05:31,270
and want to think about how cute Mint is too?

2843
02:05:31,610 --> 02:05:32,550
Odd, but cute.

2844
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:39,180
I am continuing this game.

2845
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:48,020
I am continuing!

2846
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:49,240
Forward!

2847
02:05:53,370 --> 02:05:54,290
In order to...

2848
02:05:54,290 --> 02:05:56,050
bring a final close to that case...

2849
02:05:56,050 --> 02:05:57,070
and put it to rest forever.

2850
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:02,160
Kawaii doko ga?

2851
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:06,520
Lin believes you're innocent.

2852
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:08,780
She's running around right now trying to prove it.

2853
02:06:12,870 --> 02:06:13,990
Aw, you two.

2854
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:36,680
You're all gross.

2855
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:38,760
You're all gross.

2856
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:44,240
For disregarding this man's death.

2857
02:06:50,590 --> 02:06:51,190
Let's go.

2858
02:06:51,190 --> 02:06:51,950
Cute is justice.

2859
02:06:52,650 --> 02:06:54,110
Moe is justice.

2860
02:06:55,370 --> 02:06:55,970
Moe!

2861
02:06:56,910 --> 02:06:58,090
Moe is everything.

2862
02:06:59,010 --> 02:07:00,170
But it's not me.

2863
02:07:02,390 --> 02:07:02,990
Okay.

2864
02:07:05,950 --> 02:07:07,430
We're trash, remember?

2865
02:07:09,310 --> 02:07:11,530
I need to go get more tea soon.

2866
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:14,310
Oh my gosh, this soundtrack is so awesome.

2867
02:07:16,590 --> 02:07:17,190
Okay.

2868
02:07:17,290 --> 02:07:18,670
Can I please get the...

2869
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:19,410
to the game?

2870
02:07:21,910 --> 02:07:23,930
Is that all you have to leave her with?

2871
02:07:24,050 --> 02:07:25,030
No problem there?

2872
02:07:26,870 --> 02:07:27,310
I...

2873
02:07:27,770 --> 02:07:30,970
I was sentenced to the death penalty for killing my wife, Alma.

2874
02:07:32,930 --> 02:07:35,010
But to me, that's not all it was for.

2875
02:07:36,090 --> 02:07:37,750
We mourn in our own ways.

2876
02:07:37,990 --> 02:07:39,010
My cats are cute.

2877
02:07:39,150 --> 02:07:40,070
You're okay, I guess.

2878
02:07:40,770 --> 02:07:42,110
Cats are always the cutest.

2879
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:44,630
You guys...

2880
02:07:44,630 --> 02:07:45,310
Oh my gosh, no.

2881
02:07:45,450 --> 02:07:46,590
I'm gonna save it for the podcast.

2882
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:49,310
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna save it for the podcast.

2883
02:07:49,730 --> 02:07:53,570
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna save it for the podcast.

2884
02:07:54,010 --> 02:07:54,650
Kawaii Koko.

2885
02:07:54,910 --> 02:07:55,150
Kawaii Koko.

2886
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:00,460
What do you mean that's not all it was for?

2887
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:02,500
Stop interrupting me!

2888
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:04,200
Okay, I'm gonna go get some water.

2889
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:06,400
Since you guys need to get this out of your system.

2890
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:07,780
Get it out of your system.

2891
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:08,580
I'm gonna get some water.

2892
02:08:08,820 --> 02:08:10,220
You guys, I wanna...

2893
02:08:10,220 --> 02:08:12,500
I wanna read the important things going on.

2894
02:08:13,140 --> 02:08:14,280
What's wrong with you?

2895
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:16,360
Why would you interrupt right now?

2896
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:18,060
Okay, I'm gonna go get some water.

2897
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:19,880
I'll be right back.

2898
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:21,120
I'll be right back.

2899
02:08:21,540 --> 02:08:22,880
Cliffhanger for like two minutes.

2900
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:25,860
Actually, I'm gonna go to the little ghosties room too.

2901
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:27,100
So like...

2902
02:08:27,980 --> 02:08:28,600
Five minutes.

2903
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:29,720
Even less than.

2904
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:31,140
Okay, be right back.

2905
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:33,280
I'm

2906
02:11:05,950 --> 02:11:06,950
back, I'm back, I'm back.

2907
02:11:07,090 --> 02:11:08,210
Thank you for all the super chats.

2908
02:11:08,630 --> 02:11:09,910
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2909
02:11:10,810 --> 02:11:13,130
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2910
02:11:13,810 --> 02:11:14,450
Thank you.

2911
02:11:14,630 --> 02:11:15,950
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2912
02:11:16,250 --> 02:11:16,990
Thank you, thank you.

2913
02:11:17,170 --> 02:11:17,850
That was quick.

2914
02:11:17,950 --> 02:11:18,770
I said I would be quick.

2915
02:11:19,030 --> 02:11:20,810
I said so, I said so.

2916
02:11:23,190 --> 02:11:24,050
I said so.

2917
02:11:26,850 --> 02:11:27,890
I found a cute ghost.

2918
02:11:27,910 --> 02:11:28,670
Her name is Mint Phantom.

2919
02:11:30,230 --> 02:11:30,670
Scatter!

2920
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:35,170
Did you wash your hands?

2921
02:11:35,210 --> 02:11:35,610
Of course!

2922
02:11:36,770 --> 02:11:38,450
Why would you ask me that, Dust Girl?

2923
02:11:38,670 --> 02:11:40,410
I always wash my hands!

2924
02:11:43,550 --> 02:11:44,430
Everyone scatter!

2925
02:11:46,070 --> 02:11:46,510
Okay.

2926
02:11:46,510 --> 02:11:48,810
Are we ready to continue the game now?

2927
02:11:49,310 --> 02:11:51,410
Are we ready to continue the story?

2928
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:54,310
Are you ready?

2929
02:12:00,510 --> 02:12:01,550
Are you ready?

2930
02:12:01,550 --> 02:12:01,590
Yes.

2931
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:03,030
Okay.

2932
02:12:04,870 --> 02:12:06,610
Thank you for all the super chats, you guys.

2933
02:12:07,710 --> 02:12:09,690
What do you mean that's not all it was for?

2934
02:12:10,110 --> 02:12:10,430
What do you mean that's not all it was for?

2935
02:12:12,090 --> 02:12:15,010
I'm talking about something that happened even before this case.

2936
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:18,870
I stole somebody else's life.

2937
02:12:19,730 --> 02:12:20,930
I stole somebody else's life.

2938
02:12:20,930 --> 02:12:21,850
Thanks for the gift.

2939
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:24,930
What?

2940
02:12:28,970 --> 02:12:30,130
The other murder.

2941
02:12:30,570 --> 02:12:32,330
It was 10 years ago.

2942
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:33,890
I'll never forget it.

2943
02:12:34,850 --> 02:12:37,150
That day I saved the life of a little girl.

2944
02:12:37,690 --> 02:12:40,110
And I stole away the life of a man.

2945
02:12:41,010 --> 02:12:41,570
Oh, yeah.

2946
02:12:42,910 --> 02:12:45,110
A cute positive genius ghost.

2947
02:12:45,550 --> 02:12:46,170
It's me.

2948
02:12:47,190 --> 02:12:47,890
It's me.

2949
02:12:53,190 --> 02:12:54,170
10 years ago.

2950
02:12:54,290 --> 02:12:55,430
The life of a little girl.

2951
02:12:55,770 --> 02:12:57,190
Could that little girl be...

2952
02:12:57,190 --> 02:12:58,030
Lin?

2953
02:12:59,710 --> 02:13:00,930
She told you about that?

2954
02:13:01,790 --> 02:13:02,270
Yeah.

2955
02:13:02,370 --> 02:13:03,750
She said you were her hero.

2956
02:13:05,590 --> 02:13:08,150
Now just calm down and drop that weapon!

2957
02:13:09,310 --> 02:13:10,270
Stay back!

2958
02:13:10,430 --> 02:13:12,510
If you come any closer, I'll shoot her!

2959
02:13:12,730 --> 02:13:14,170
I mean, you...

2960
02:13:14,690 --> 02:13:15,730
I mean, you...

2961
02:13:15,730 --> 02:13:16,590
You...

2962
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:20,610
Thanks for holding her up.

2963
02:13:20,610 --> 02:13:21,770
I hope I need to feed my cats.

2964
02:13:24,990 --> 02:13:26,910
10 years ago in a certain park.

2965
02:13:27,230 --> 02:13:29,010
A little girl was taken hostage.

2966
02:13:29,170 --> 02:13:30,150
Okay, this is a good summary.

2967
02:13:30,250 --> 02:13:30,910
Or a good...

2968
02:13:32,830 --> 02:13:33,970
Reminder of what happened before.

2969
02:13:34,550 --> 02:13:35,590
I was still young then.

2970
02:13:36,170 --> 02:13:36,610
Arrogant.

2971
02:13:36,830 --> 02:13:37,270
Arrogant.

2972
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:38,790
Stop, Spongebob!

2973
02:13:39,030 --> 02:13:40,510
No, Garlabob!

2974
02:13:42,030 --> 02:13:44,390
The world's cutest Minto!

2975
02:13:50,420 --> 02:13:51,760
Thank you for the Akadono.

2976
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:52,440
Thank you!

2977
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:54,260
Thank you so much.

2978
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:57,520
Hmm...

2979
02:13:57,520 --> 02:13:59,200
But you couldn't tell me that yesterday, huh?

2980
02:13:59,300 --> 02:14:00,300
When we were playing...

2981
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:02,040
When we were playing Lethal Company, huh?

2982
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:05,120
Yesterday I did a Patreon stream.

2983
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:07,940
And we played Lethal Company.

2984
02:14:17,230 --> 02:14:17,970
Do you want me to?

2985
02:14:18,030 --> 02:14:18,710
I will next time.

2986
02:14:18,790 --> 02:14:19,030
No!

2987
02:14:20,610 --> 02:14:21,430
Not at all.

2988
02:14:23,450 --> 02:14:24,650
I was still young then.

2989
02:14:24,750 --> 02:14:25,950
I didn't have any self-control.

2990
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:27,450
Sounds like you guys.

2991
02:14:27,450 --> 02:14:29,930
I remember asking myself at the time.

2992
02:14:30,630 --> 02:14:31,190
Jaude...

2993
02:14:31,190 --> 02:14:32,570
Are you going to shoot this guy?

2994
02:14:33,610 --> 02:14:35,270
And this is what I answered.

2995
02:14:35,750 --> 02:14:38,210
Yeah, I'm gonna shoot that guy!

2996
02:14:44,030 --> 02:14:45,590
I was too starstruck.

2997
02:14:47,570 --> 02:14:48,270
It's okay.

2998
02:14:48,390 --> 02:14:50,290
If you're part of the Patreon...

2999
02:14:50,290 --> 02:14:53,050
The two tiers...

3000
02:14:53,690 --> 02:14:54,930
We'll do another one.

3001
02:14:55,870 --> 02:14:56,670
Another one.

3002
02:14:57,450 --> 02:14:58,350
If we missed out, don't worry.

3003
02:14:58,730 --> 02:15:00,210
My hand was shaking a little.

3004
02:15:00,310 --> 02:15:02,930
If my hand slipped, the man might die.

3005
02:15:03,710 --> 02:15:05,750
Even the little hostage girl was in danger.

3006
02:15:10,610 --> 02:15:11,090
Nevertheless...

3007
02:15:11,090 --> 02:15:12,230
That was my answer.

3008
02:15:12,570 --> 02:15:14,690
Yeah, I'm going to shoot!

3009
02:15:15,550 --> 02:15:16,030
Woohoo!

3010
02:15:24,330 --> 02:15:25,590
And the man died.

3011
02:15:26,210 --> 02:15:27,390
I took his life.

3012
02:15:28,710 --> 02:15:29,190
Yo!

3013
02:15:30,810 --> 02:15:31,790
It's pretty messed up.

3014
02:15:32,070 --> 02:15:33,210
Lin was never dead.

3015
02:15:33,230 --> 02:15:33,990
I never told the outcome.

3016
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:35,750
She was so young at the time.

3017
02:15:36,230 --> 02:15:37,930
I don't deserve to be called a hero.

3018
02:15:38,250 --> 02:15:39,710
What I deserve is...

3019
02:15:40,670 --> 02:15:41,130
Execution.

3020
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:43,510
Aww...

3021
02:15:43,510 --> 02:15:45,050
He has all that guilt.

3022
02:15:45,630 --> 02:15:47,630
But he was holding a little girl hostage!

3023
02:15:47,730 --> 02:15:48,410
I'm sorry, what?

3024
02:15:51,190 --> 02:15:53,190
So anyway, I started blasting.

3025
02:15:53,710 --> 02:15:55,590
That man pointing the gun at you right now.

3026
02:15:55,810 --> 02:15:57,370
They say he's your good friend.

3027
02:15:57,570 --> 02:15:58,710
Why is good friend?

3028
02:15:59,330 --> 02:16:00,170
In quotes.

3029
02:16:01,050 --> 02:16:01,590
And...

3030
02:16:02,610 --> 02:16:03,410
He's your...

3031
02:16:04,350 --> 02:16:05,430
Good friend!

3032
02:16:08,610 --> 02:16:09,690
He's your...

3033
02:16:10,650 --> 02:16:11,650
He's your...

3034
02:16:12,170 --> 02:16:13,130
Good friend!

3035
02:16:14,470 --> 02:16:16,370
History would say they were roommates.

3036
02:16:19,130 --> 02:16:19,910
We were.

3037
02:16:20,210 --> 02:16:22,230
When we were in the detective division together.

3038
02:16:24,290 --> 02:16:25,830
That was a long time ago.

3039
02:16:26,210 --> 02:16:28,050
I think we're going to have to kill this guy.

3040
02:16:28,410 --> 02:16:28,930
Damn!

3041
02:16:31,050 --> 02:16:32,470
Platypus, thanks for the money!

3042
02:16:32,650 --> 02:16:32,950
Thank you!

3043
02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:36,730
Now he's the head of the special investigation unit.

3044
02:16:36,910 --> 02:16:38,150
The top of the elite.

3045
02:16:38,670 --> 02:16:41,150
Getting ahead is the only thing he thinks about now.

3046
02:16:42,810 --> 02:16:45,910
And that white coat of his is the symbol of his determination.

3047
02:16:46,950 --> 02:16:48,030
His white coat?

3048
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:53,010
For somebody looking to get promoted to the top, What's the one thing they're afraid of most?

3049
02:17:07,380 --> 02:17:08,340
Getting dirty!

3050
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:10,320
Ghosts?

3051
02:17:10,940 --> 02:17:11,420
Ghosts?

3052
02:17:11,720 --> 02:17:13,720
A blot on their record, of course.

3053
02:17:14,520 --> 02:17:17,120
Like a stain on a pure white coat.

3054
02:17:18,140 --> 02:17:20,660
Who would promote a man with a coat covered in stains?

3055
02:17:21,640 --> 02:17:24,800
If it was me, I'd go with the black coat that didn't show the stains.

3056
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:28,620
Then why don't you change your red coat, huh?

3057
02:17:29,540 --> 02:17:31,440
The world is full of excellent candidates.

3058
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:33,940
Even one mistake could be the end of a career.

3059
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:36,440
But everyone makes mistakes, right?

3060
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:41,240
Nevertheless, Cabanela has chosen the path of the white coat.

3061
02:17:46,220 --> 02:17:51,260
And he'd do anything, anything at all to hide his coat's shadows.

3062
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:53,720
Oh, so it's not so clean after all.

3063
02:17:53,780 --> 02:17:56,720
Oh my gosh, take a UV light to that coat!

3064
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:01,640
Take a UV light to that coat and see what it shows!

3065
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:02,340
Huh?

3066
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:09,060
Like send his good friend to the gallows.

3067
02:18:15,710 --> 02:18:16,710
That's because...

3068
02:18:16,710 --> 02:18:18,890
Oh, because that's the right thing to do.

3069
02:18:19,070 --> 02:18:20,970
I'm a condemned criminal after all.

3070
02:18:21,870 --> 02:18:22,710
Covered in ectoplasm.

3071
02:18:23,450 --> 02:18:25,090
No, I was thinking the blood.

3072
02:18:26,850 --> 02:18:28,270
What were you guys thinking?

3073
02:18:29,590 --> 02:18:30,950
I was thinking of blood.

3074
02:18:31,350 --> 02:18:35,890
That you, like, use the solution and then it shows in the UV light.

3075
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:46,780
Ectoplasm?

3076
02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:50,800
I don't think ectoplasm would show in a UV light.

3077
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:52,100
Oh, wait.

3078
02:18:52,180 --> 02:18:52,500
What?

3079
02:18:56,940 --> 02:18:58,020
Wait, yes it does.

3080
02:19:09,540 --> 02:19:10,220
Uh-oh.

3081
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:11,300
I think I'm in trouble.

3082
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:13,760
Uh-oh.

3083
02:19:16,660 --> 02:19:17,620
Uh-oh.

3084
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:18,840
I think...

3085
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:26,240
And that's why he has that gun pointed at me right now.

3086
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:28,740
Alright, let's ask about ourselves.

3087
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:30,580
The one that I've been the most curious about.

3088
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:32,240
I saw it, you know.

3089
02:19:32,800 --> 02:19:35,000
That picture you were painting in your cell tonight.

3090
02:19:35,520 --> 02:19:36,440
That was me.

3091
02:19:37,460 --> 02:19:38,100
Which means...

3092
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:39,060
You must know me.

3093
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:42,500
I'm very sorry, but...

3094
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,940
I can't talk to you about that now.

3095
02:19:45,420 --> 02:19:45,880
What?

3096
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:46,340
Why not?

3097
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:50,800
Maybe I really am Sissel.

3098
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:53,100
Because I...

3099
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:54,320
I loved you.

3100
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:56,540
I don't know your true face?

3101
02:19:57,680 --> 02:19:59,120
Oh my gosh, my glasses.

3102
02:19:59,260 --> 02:20:00,000
Oh, I'm one of those.

3103
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:01,260
I don't take off my glasses.

3104
02:20:02,300 --> 02:20:03,520
My true face?

3105
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:05,140
I'm a detective.

3106
02:20:05,140 --> 02:20:07,420
I can only talk about what I'm sure of.

3107
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:08,840
However...

3108
02:20:10,020 --> 02:20:12,280
I can give you one lead at least.

3109
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:13,400
One month!

3110
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:14,040
Yeah!

3111
02:20:14,320 --> 02:20:15,000
Roaring John!

3112
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:15,700
Thank you!

3113
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:18,220
A lead?

3114
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:19,200
What is it?

3115
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:22,660
A long time ago, I gave Lin something to hold onto me.

3116
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:23,560
Onto for me!

3117
02:20:23,620 --> 02:20:24,440
The music box!

3118
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:25,680
It was a music box!

3119
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:26,200
Yes, yes, yes!

3120
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:30,000
If you ever come across it, I advise you to open it.

3121
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:32,180
It might jog your memory.

3122
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:35,120
That wooden box I found in Lin's room.

3123
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:35,320
In his apartment!

3124
02:20:36,220 --> 02:20:38,400
And that's the only help I can give you right now.

3125
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:40,080
Oh my god, we were right next to it.

3126
02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:41,220
The whole time.

3127
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:44,880
Are we about to watch him get...

3128
02:20:44,880 --> 02:20:46,020
get... get dead?

3129
02:20:47,900 --> 02:20:48,660
Ready to go?

3130
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:50,920
My arms are getting tired.

3131
02:20:51,960 --> 02:20:52,900
You got it, baby.

3132
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:56,200
Time for the big show of hauling you in.

3133
02:20:57,100 --> 02:20:58,160
Oh, he's not gonna shoot.

3134
02:20:58,980 --> 02:20:59,680
Don't shoot!

3135
02:21:00,360 --> 02:21:01,180
Oh, that's right.

3136
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:03,420
Just let me make...

3137
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:05,540
a phone call.

3138
02:21:06,440 --> 02:21:10,480
That's a big favor to ask so casually, my old friend.

3139
02:21:11,420 --> 02:21:13,460
Tell you what I'll do...

3140
02:21:16,380 --> 02:21:18,360
I'll pretend I'm not watching.

3141
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:19,880
I'll be listening, though.

3142
02:21:20,020 --> 02:21:21,600
On that, you can rely.

3143
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:26,360
Oogie, why does the paint change on his jacket like that?

3144
02:21:27,060 --> 02:21:29,160
Sissel, you've got your own path to follow.

3145
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:30,340
You'd better hurry.

3146
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:31,820
My own path?

3147
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:34,100
Lin is at the Justice...

3148
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:36,260
Sister's office right now, right?

3149
02:21:36,540 --> 02:21:39,960
It might not be a bad idea to say my final farewell to him, too.

3150
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:41,800
Beep boop bop beep.

3151
02:21:42,500 --> 02:21:43,240
Moshi moshi.

3152
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:46,980
Hello?

3153
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:48,120
Everything's fine here!

3154
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:49,080
Uh oh.

3155
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:49,940
Lin?

3156
02:21:51,700 --> 02:21:52,140
Uh...

3157
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:54,460
Is this the chicken kitchen?

3158
02:21:54,740 --> 02:21:56,280
I'd like to request a delivery.

3159
02:21:57,900 --> 02:21:58,340
Um...

3160
02:21:58,340 --> 02:22:00,280
The chicken kitchen is next door.

3161
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:04,880
Aye, good day to you, sir.

3162
02:22:04,980 --> 02:22:05,880
Good day to you.

3163
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:07,400
Oh...

3164
02:22:08,660 --> 02:22:09,140
Alright.

3165
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:13,520
Hmm...

3166
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:15,680
Sounds like she's in some kind of trouble.

3167
02:22:16,340 --> 02:22:17,600
It does, doesn't it?

3168
02:22:18,180 --> 02:22:19,880
Go help her out, would you, Sissel?

3169
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:24,920
Sorry to keep...

3170
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:27,640
Sorry to keep you waiting, Inspector.

3171
02:22:28,360 --> 02:22:29,180
Ready to go?

3172
02:22:29,420 --> 02:22:32,260
I bet Inspector Cabanela's probably like, Oh my gosh.

3173
02:22:32,480 --> 02:22:34,580
He really lost his mind in that jail cell.

3174
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:35,720
Now he's talking to ghosts.

3175
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:40,090
Hahaha.

3176
02:22:42,850 --> 02:22:43,430
Pring!

3177
02:22:43,990 --> 02:22:45,950
Oh, before I forget...

3178
02:22:45,950 --> 02:22:46,530
Don't shoot.

3179
02:22:46,710 --> 02:22:47,510
Don't shoot.

3180
02:22:47,730 --> 02:22:48,350
Don't shoot.

3181
02:22:48,570 --> 02:22:49,090
Oh.

3182
02:22:50,110 --> 02:22:52,030
I have a little something for you.

3183
02:22:52,830 --> 02:22:53,650
A hug?

3184
02:22:57,100 --> 02:22:57,680
What?

3185
02:22:58,460 --> 02:22:59,400
Are you...

3186
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:00,460
What?

3187
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:02,860
Are you gonna hypnotize me?

3188
02:23:03,020 --> 02:23:03,780
What's going on?

3189
02:23:05,370 --> 02:23:06,320
Just like my doujins.

3190
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:09,180
A present, if you will.

3191
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:11,520
There's nothing else like it, baby.

3192
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:15,160
If there's nothing else like it, don't throw it.

3193
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:16,960
Oh.

3194
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:19,480
What's this?

3195
02:23:19,640 --> 02:23:20,220
A pocket watch?

3196
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:24,380
Considering my situation, it's the last thing in the world I need right now.

3197
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:26,020
He needs more time.

3198
02:23:26,240 --> 02:23:27,240
He gave you more time!

3199
02:23:28,980 --> 02:23:29,940
Forgive me, man.

3200
02:23:30,340 --> 02:23:32,920
Let's just say I'm no good at choosing presents.

3201
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:38,750
Okay.

3202
02:23:39,370 --> 02:23:40,410
This is it, Sissel.

3203
02:23:42,470 --> 02:23:43,050
I'm done with one thing.

3204
02:23:43,670 --> 02:23:45,470
Don't trust other people's memories.

3205
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:48,330
Look for what you seek with your own eyes.

3206
02:23:48,950 --> 02:23:50,290
I'll remember that.

3207
02:23:52,230 --> 02:23:54,410
Actually, people's memories are very...

3208
02:23:55,570 --> 02:23:57,650
are very unreliable.

3209
02:24:00,630 --> 02:24:03,590
Witness testimony's not great all the time.

3210
02:24:05,750 --> 02:24:06,630
They're gone.

3211
02:24:06,890 --> 02:24:08,110
There's nothing left here.

3212
02:24:08,290 --> 02:24:09,030
No hope.

3213
02:24:09,130 --> 02:24:10,370
No cores either.

3214
02:24:12,670 --> 02:24:13,150
Okay.

3215
02:24:14,310 --> 02:24:16,670
Without any cores, I can't follow after them.

3216
02:24:16,850 --> 02:24:18,310
This is the end of my adventure.

3217
02:24:18,710 --> 02:24:21,670
I feel pretty dejected, but I guess I'd better go find Lin.

3218
02:24:24,870 --> 02:24:26,290
Fake memories are a thing?

3219
02:24:26,350 --> 02:24:27,190
A scary thing?

3220
02:24:27,330 --> 02:24:28,230
Yeah, I can imagine.

3221
02:24:35,560 --> 02:24:37,980
Parrot's memories, however, are rock solid.

3222
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:41,320
Holy hell, is this Ace Attorney?

3223
02:24:41,320 --> 02:24:42,220
Yes!

3224
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:47,180
Thanks for the super chat, Evan.

3225
02:24:47,640 --> 02:24:50,500
I'll follow the path Detective Jowd pointed out to me.

3226
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:52,760
The path to the Justice Minister's office.

3227
02:24:52,820 --> 02:24:55,180
Where Lin went to try and stop the execution.

3228
02:24:58,570 --> 02:25:02,070
I don't remember saying this before, but this didn't stop.

3229
02:25:04,390 --> 02:25:04,890
Trava!

3230
02:25:04,950 --> 02:25:06,270
Is that what the song is called?

3231
02:25:06,570 --> 02:25:07,110
Oh my god.

3232
02:25:07,830 --> 02:25:08,610
Let's save.

3233
02:25:09,050 --> 02:25:09,970
And keep going.

3234
02:25:14,130 --> 02:25:15,010
1141 PM.

3235
02:25:15,190 --> 02:25:15,750
It's so late.

3236
02:25:15,850 --> 02:25:17,490
Why would the Justice Minister still be there?

3237
02:25:19,430 --> 02:25:26,830
Now that my assignment to stop the execution has ended in such an unsatisfactory way, I decided to go see Lin at the Justice Minister's office.

3238
02:25:29,330 --> 02:25:30,390
Oh yeah, it's here.

3239
02:25:30,590 --> 02:25:31,070
I forgot.

3240
02:25:33,510 --> 02:25:36,730
Detective Jowd's story about this other murder weighs on me heavily.

3241
02:25:37,030 --> 02:25:38,450
Should I tell Lin about it?

3242
02:25:38,550 --> 02:25:39,570
I just don't know.

3243
02:25:39,570 --> 02:25:41,890
Please attorney the phantom pain.

3244
02:25:46,190 --> 02:25:49,070
Why are there pills on the ground?

3245
02:25:49,530 --> 02:25:50,570
What is she doing?

3246
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:53,890
Oh, she is... This time, Lin isn't dead.

3247
02:25:54,090 --> 02:25:54,330
Wow!

3248
02:25:55,170 --> 02:25:59,470
But the atmosphere makes me think it might be too soon to count my blessings just yet.

3249
02:26:00,010 --> 02:26:00,910
Thank you, thank you.

3250
02:26:01,190 --> 02:26:01,650
Chuu!

3251
02:26:02,090 --> 02:26:02,610
Chuu!

3252
02:26:03,170 --> 02:26:04,150
Lin is so cute.

3253
02:26:06,290 --> 02:26:06,810
Oh.

3254
02:26:06,810 --> 02:26:07,330
Chuu.

3255
02:26:08,490 --> 02:26:10,110
I'm glad Lin isn't dead.

3256
02:26:10,350 --> 02:26:11,130
Oh man!

3257
02:26:11,330 --> 02:26:12,750
Lin dead counter zero!

3258
02:26:13,850 --> 02:26:15,310
What in the world is she doing?

3259
02:26:17,070 --> 02:26:18,750
Help step ghost, I'm stuck.

3260
02:26:19,410 --> 02:26:21,330
Then again, do I really want to know?

3261
02:26:22,650 --> 02:26:23,170
What...

3262
02:26:23,790 --> 02:26:24,910
is she doing?

3263
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:36,200
Sorry, I was drinking.

3264
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:37,480
I almost spit out my tea!

3265
02:26:39,260 --> 02:26:43,100
Oh my god!

3266
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:44,480
I almost spit out my tea!

3267
02:26:46,060 --> 02:26:47,100
Uh... Lin?

3268
02:26:49,800 --> 02:26:51,140
What kind of greeting is that?

3269
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:53,820
I mean, I know I'm a ghost and everything, but...

3270
02:26:53,820 --> 02:26:55,160
Well, and how did it go?

3271
02:26:55,320 --> 02:26:56,640
Was detective Zhao still alive?

3272
02:26:57,840 --> 02:27:00,180
He had already been executed by the time I got there.

3273
02:27:00,380 --> 02:27:02,400
I did manage to save him, but...

3274
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:03,160
You did?

3275
02:27:03,320 --> 02:27:04,040
I'm so glad!

3276
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:05,720
Wait, wait a minute.

3277
02:27:05,820 --> 02:27:06,540
Did you say but?

3278
02:27:07,440 --> 02:27:08,460
It's 3.30 AM.

3279
02:27:08,580 --> 02:27:09,620
Do I grab an ice cream?

3280
02:27:09,860 --> 02:27:10,220
Thanks.

3281
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:13,240
Yeah, I think so.

3282
02:27:14,660 --> 02:27:16,140
I love late night ice cream.

3283
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:17,820
What kind of ice cream are you gonna get though?

3284
02:27:17,820 --> 02:27:19,480
Uh... Ripped tea.

3285
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:20,480
No, I drank it.

3286
02:27:21,220 --> 02:27:21,700
Luckily.

3287
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:26,540
I told Lin about my adventure at the prison.

3288
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:28,920
About that other murder though.

3289
02:27:29,980 --> 02:27:31,460
Couldn't bring myself to tell her.

3290
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:47,420
At least, you know, as much as I wasn't a huge fan of the last thing where we had to do the sneaking mission, I appreciate the game trying out other methods of, you know, having us use the ghost.

3291
02:27:47,820 --> 02:27:48,080
Trick.

3292
02:27:48,340 --> 02:27:49,540
So I think that's kind of fun.

3293
02:27:55,450 --> 02:27:57,570
Inspector Cabanela arrested Detective Jowd?

3294
02:27:58,110 --> 02:27:59,530
I can't believe it!

3295
02:28:01,770 --> 02:28:02,370
Cinder K!

3296
02:28:02,650 --> 02:28:03,730
Thank you for the time gifted!

3297
02:28:05,510 --> 02:28:07,970
Yeah, a little break up in design is cool once in a while.

3298
02:28:08,170 --> 02:28:09,390
Yeah, and it wasn't so long.

3299
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:13,310
She seems to have some yabai reading preferences.

3300
02:28:15,030 --> 02:28:17,030
My favorite ice cream is mint cookie crumble.

3301
02:28:17,350 --> 02:28:17,510
Woo!

3302
02:28:20,190 --> 02:28:21,270
You're making me hungry.

3303
02:28:23,350 --> 02:28:24,630
I feel the same way.

3304
02:28:24,970 --> 02:28:28,310
I can't believe that wherever I go, somebody is always dead.

3305
02:28:28,530 --> 02:28:30,410
Either you or someone else.

3306
02:28:31,150 --> 02:28:32,090
Sorry about that.

3307
02:28:32,670 --> 02:28:34,690
So who is that lying on the floor there?

3308
02:28:35,190 --> 02:28:36,450
Oh, you noticed him, did you?

3309
02:28:36,730 --> 02:28:39,010
That's the Justice Minister.

3310
02:28:39,530 --> 02:28:42,390
The man who signed the order to carry out Detective Jowd's execution?

3311
02:28:43,170 --> 02:28:44,810
He was already dead when I got here.

3312
02:28:45,970 --> 02:28:47,610
Shouldn't you have called for help in the case?

3313
02:28:48,870 --> 02:28:50,030
I guess so.

3314
02:28:50,610 --> 02:28:51,050
Lynn?

3315
02:28:52,590 --> 02:28:54,410
But I'm wanted, remember?

3316
02:28:54,630 --> 02:28:55,290
For murder?

3317
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:59,270
I was hoping we could save him without me getting caught.

3318
02:29:00,470 --> 02:29:01,150
Oui, eh?

3319
02:29:01,390 --> 02:29:02,490
Oh boy.

3320
02:29:04,170 --> 02:29:05,670
The guy with the marriage troubles?

3321
02:29:05,870 --> 02:29:06,350
I think so.

3322
02:29:08,370 --> 02:29:09,370
Oh, oops, my bad.

3323
02:29:10,530 --> 02:29:11,510
Let's talk to him.

3324
02:29:11,730 --> 02:29:13,130
Let's see what he's got to say.

3325
02:29:15,450 --> 02:29:16,510
Hey, can you hear me?

3326
02:29:17,510 --> 02:29:18,530
Are you awake?

3327
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:21,530
Hmm, he's dead but he still seems to be unconscious.

3328
02:29:22,590 --> 02:29:23,950
Could you rescue him now?

3329
02:29:24,150 --> 02:29:25,190
While he's still unconscious?

3330
02:29:25,950 --> 02:29:30,630
Instead of talking to him, I bet it'll be faster to see, just to see for yourself what really happened.

3331
02:29:31,410 --> 02:29:32,490
Yeah, I bet you're right.

3332
02:29:33,170 --> 02:29:35,730
Back we go then to four minutes before his death.

3333
02:29:38,930 --> 02:29:39,850
Rewind time.

3334
02:29:40,010 --> 02:29:40,210
Hold on.

3335
02:29:40,310 --> 02:29:44,070
I have some some dried mango.

3336
02:29:44,070 --> 02:29:45,050
Ow!

3337
02:29:45,650 --> 02:29:47,190
I'm gonna eat it.

3338
02:29:47,990 --> 02:29:50,090
Dried mango, 1131.

3339
02:29:52,530 --> 02:29:54,890
Yeah, this is the guy with the marriage problems.

3340
02:29:57,270 --> 02:29:58,270
What's he doing?

3341
02:29:58,470 --> 02:30:00,430
Oh, he's a jumpy bunch.

3342
02:30:00,810 --> 02:30:01,210
Emma!

3343
02:30:03,270 --> 02:30:04,130
Not Emma.

3344
02:30:04,230 --> 02:30:05,110
Oh, excuse me.

3345
02:30:08,210 --> 02:30:08,850
What?

3346
02:30:08,850 --> 02:30:09,750
What?

3347
02:30:14,440 --> 02:30:15,100
Alright.

3348
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:17,700
I'll do as you say.

3349
02:30:25,540 --> 02:30:26,900
This is terrible.

3350
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:36,780
Mint mango.

3351
02:30:42,440 --> 02:30:43,480
What's going on?

3352
02:30:44,350 --> 02:30:45,580
Why doesn't she answer?

3353
02:30:52,740 --> 02:30:53,340
Um.

3354
02:30:59,070 --> 02:31:00,250
Is he gonna die?

3355
02:31:00,490 --> 02:31:01,610
From heartbreak?

3356
02:31:05,150 --> 02:31:05,750
Oh?

3357
02:31:06,370 --> 02:31:06,970
Oh

3358
02:31:13,620 --> 02:31:13,800
my god.

3359
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:14,240
Medicine!

3360
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:21,700
That explains the pills over there.

3361
02:31:22,300 --> 02:31:23,080
Pills here.

3362
02:31:25,540 --> 02:31:26,140
Oh.

3363
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:27,120
Water!

3364
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:29,420
Oh my god.

3365
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:30,020
This poor guy.

3366
02:31:30,580 --> 02:31:31,860
This is so sad.

3367
02:31:36,090 --> 02:31:36,690
Oh.

3368
02:31:37,390 --> 02:31:37,950
Fucks.

3369
02:31:40,170 --> 02:31:40,730
Die!

3370
02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:43,450
Thank you.

3371
02:31:43,530 --> 02:31:43,850
Thank you.

3372
02:31:44,030 --> 02:31:44,330
Chu!

3373
02:31:47,210 --> 02:31:54,050
Something about a serious flashback with a somber music and then Spongebob saying arigato, arigato, chu is sending me.

3374
02:31:54,990 --> 02:31:56,310
Such a foolish man.

3375
02:31:56,930 --> 02:31:57,930
Oh, you woke up.

3376
02:31:58,690 --> 02:32:00,850
He's a contradiction.

3377
02:32:02,310 --> 02:32:02,870
Contradiction?

3378
02:32:03,930 --> 02:32:07,510
The more we search for the truth, the further into a dilemma we fall.

3379
02:32:08,350 --> 02:32:11,530
The world of men is steeped in contradictions.

3380
02:32:11,650 --> 02:32:14,290
If we choose this, we can't have that.

3381
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:19,710
If a man tries to have his medicine bottle and water pitcher, too, he loses both.

3382
02:32:20,830 --> 02:32:21,710
Thank you.

3383
02:32:22,410 --> 02:32:26,330
What will we find if we put your maid cafe under UV lights, Mint?

3384
02:32:26,470 --> 02:32:27,430
Care to explain?

3385
02:32:29,410 --> 02:32:30,350
I don't know.

3386
02:32:30,450 --> 02:32:31,050
I mean...

3387
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:34,450
I'm a ghost.

3388
02:32:34,450 --> 02:32:37,810
If I walk around, ectoplasm kind of gets places.

3389
02:32:38,330 --> 02:32:39,450
It's not my fault.

3390
02:32:40,110 --> 02:32:41,370
It's just how it is.

3391
02:32:41,950 --> 02:32:43,050
I'm like a snail.

3392
02:32:46,310 --> 02:32:47,250
I don't know.

3393
02:32:47,330 --> 02:32:50,270
To me, it looks like you could have had both of those things just now.

3394
02:32:51,370 --> 02:32:54,830
He didn't know the truth about the world.

3395
02:32:55,150 --> 02:32:56,590
That's why he died.

3396
02:32:56,990 --> 02:32:58,450
Such a foolish man.

3397
02:32:59,670 --> 02:33:02,150
Or maybe I should say a pathetic man.

3398
02:33:02,550 --> 02:33:04,070
That's more... that's...

3399
02:33:04,450 --> 02:33:05,470
the more fitting word.

3400
02:33:06,250 --> 02:33:08,270
I don't think this guy gets it yet.

3401
02:33:09,830 --> 02:33:12,170
That the foolish and pathetic man is him.

3402
02:33:13,450 --> 02:33:16,750
Is that why they call... is that what they call a contradiction?

3403
02:33:17,690 --> 02:33:19,070
By the way, what's your name?

3404
02:33:20,770 --> 02:33:23,190
Just call me a sicker of truth.

3405
02:33:24,490 --> 02:33:25,750
Sidestep that one, didn't he?

3406
02:33:30,850 --> 02:33:31,350
Ripperoni.

3407
02:33:33,190 --> 02:33:35,350
This one should be kind of quick though, right?

3408
02:33:39,970 --> 02:33:42,350
No need to think too hard about this one.

3409
02:33:42,550 --> 02:33:44,110
All I have to do is give him his medicine too.

3410
02:33:44,210 --> 02:33:44,830
Pretty simple.

3411
02:33:44,990 --> 02:33:46,770
But there's one more thing that concerns me.

3412
02:33:47,210 --> 02:33:50,470
What was that telephone call the justice minister got all about?

3413
02:33:50,610 --> 02:33:51,650
Oh yes, true, true.

3414
02:33:51,910 --> 02:33:56,210
It was right after that his health took an instant downturn.

3415
02:33:56,990 --> 02:34:00,270
I've never seen such a foolish, pathetic and strange man.

3416
02:34:02,890 --> 02:34:04,730
I think you'd better stop there.

3417
02:34:05,990 --> 02:34:07,570
Okay, well uh...

3418
02:34:07,570 --> 02:34:09,470
This body below is so creepy.

3419
02:34:10,190 --> 02:34:10,610
Emma!

3420
02:34:11,310 --> 02:34:12,150
Could it be?

3421
02:34:13,090 --> 02:34:14,050
Excuse me.

3422
02:34:14,310 --> 02:34:15,570
Wait, who's on the other line?

3423
02:34:15,950 --> 02:34:16,410
Oh!

3424
02:34:16,750 --> 02:34:18,110
Oh my!

3425
02:34:22,250 --> 02:34:25,050
Forgive me for calling so late, Mr. Minister.

3426
02:34:25,650 --> 02:34:28,810
Oh girl, you can call me as late as you want!

3427
02:34:30,550 --> 02:34:31,470
Who is this?

3428
02:34:31,610 --> 02:34:32,850
How did you get this number?

3429
02:34:33,570 --> 02:34:34,930
We have your daughter.

3430
02:34:35,090 --> 02:34:35,590
What?

3431
02:34:37,750 --> 02:34:38,990
We have your daughter.

3432
02:34:39,490 --> 02:34:40,630
Who is this?

3433
02:34:40,870 --> 02:34:41,510
Emily's tutor?

3434
02:34:42,710 --> 02:34:45,030
Would a tutor call you at this hour?

3435
02:34:47,090 --> 02:34:47,590
No.

3436
02:34:49,210 --> 02:34:50,650
Oh, say it one more time.

3437
02:34:50,830 --> 02:34:52,090
We have your daughter.

3438
02:34:53,110 --> 02:34:53,610
Nani?

3439
02:34:56,010 --> 02:34:57,010
My daughter!

3440
02:34:57,210 --> 02:34:58,010
Is she alright?

3441
02:34:58,290 --> 02:34:59,330
Tell me she's alright.

3442
02:35:00,330 --> 02:35:01,450
Here for yourself.

3443
02:35:04,050 --> 02:35:04,790
Papa, help!

3444
02:35:05,850 --> 02:35:07,350
I'm gonna be killed!

3445
02:35:08,190 --> 02:35:10,790
Oh my god, they turned her into a candle!

3446
02:35:11,710 --> 02:35:12,730
What do you want?

3447
02:35:12,870 --> 02:35:13,870
What are your demands?

3448
02:35:14,630 --> 02:35:17,890
I believe we already made our demand known the other day.

3449
02:35:20,550 --> 02:35:22,410
Oh, so it was you.

3450
02:35:24,510 --> 02:35:26,150
And have you complied?

3451
02:35:26,730 --> 02:35:28,230
Has the execution...

3452
02:35:28,230 --> 02:35:28,510
Oh!

3453
02:35:30,290 --> 02:35:31,750
Why do they want him dead?

3454
02:35:32,410 --> 02:35:34,490
Has the execution been carried out?

3455
02:35:35,030 --> 02:35:37,250
I didn't do it because of your demand.

3456
02:35:37,410 --> 02:35:39,950
I did it because that's my job.

3457
02:35:41,490 --> 02:35:42,050
Yes.

3458
02:35:42,050 --> 02:35:43,050
Yes, of course.

3459
02:35:43,870 --> 02:35:46,970
They should be contacting me any minute now with a confirmation.

3460
02:35:47,190 --> 02:35:48,890
There's no need for this kidnapping.

3461
02:35:50,150 --> 02:35:51,350
We're very thorough.

3462
02:35:51,570 --> 02:35:53,310
You'd do well to remember that.

3463
02:35:54,070 --> 02:35:57,450
A female ghost never talk about having a snail trail.

3464
02:35:57,450 --> 02:35:59,610
Because it's embarrassing, okay?

3465
02:35:59,770 --> 02:36:00,830
I keep it real.

3466
02:36:05,170 --> 02:36:06,890
And of course it goes without saying.

3467
02:36:07,490 --> 02:36:08,910
We're watching you.

3468
02:36:09,830 --> 02:36:14,410
If this information leaves that room, you'll never see your daughter again.

3469
02:36:14,630 --> 02:36:16,550
I trust you understand that.

3470
02:36:17,050 --> 02:36:19,190
She can keep my daughter.

3471
02:36:21,510 --> 02:36:22,910
Don't tell the police.

3472
02:36:23,110 --> 02:36:23,870
Is that it?

3473
02:36:24,630 --> 02:36:25,270
Exactly.

3474
02:36:27,450 --> 02:36:28,270
Use your job.

3475
02:36:29,050 --> 02:36:29,570
Alright.

3476
02:36:29,850 --> 02:36:30,990
I'll do as you say.

3477
02:36:31,170 --> 02:36:33,530
I'll make sure the execution is carried out tonight.

3478
02:36:33,750 --> 02:36:34,950
You have my word.

3479
02:36:35,370 --> 02:36:36,190
Uh oh.

3480
02:36:37,770 --> 02:36:38,490
Uh oh.

3481
02:36:40,010 --> 02:36:41,830
Wait, but if we go there...

3482
02:36:42,930 --> 02:36:44,870
If we go there, he's gonna die.

3483
02:36:45,810 --> 02:36:46,510
Oh well.

3484
02:36:48,050 --> 02:36:49,830
Let's go see the sexy lady.

3485
02:36:52,850 --> 02:36:55,170
Mama Smurf, I'm coming for you!

3486
02:36:55,670 --> 02:36:56,190
Mama Smurf, I'm coming for you!

3487
02:36:57,990 --> 02:37:01,030
So it was a recording of the little girl?

3488
02:37:03,130 --> 02:37:04,070
We're here.

3489
02:37:09,170 --> 02:37:12,250
Apparently, the police in this country aren't so easily fooled.

3490
02:37:12,590 --> 02:37:15,670
I had no idea word of tonight's deal had leaked.

3491
02:37:20,570 --> 02:37:21,190
Paparazzi!

3492
02:37:21,370 --> 02:37:23,130
Yep, it's a recording.

3493
02:37:23,590 --> 02:37:24,930
I'm gonna be killed!

3494
02:37:28,150 --> 02:37:32,810
Luckily, I managed to arrange it so that the justice minister could hear her... voice.

3495
02:37:33,570 --> 02:37:36,310
But what's taking the goods so long to arrive?

3496
02:37:36,670 --> 02:37:38,290
I'm starting to get concerned.

3497
02:37:40,750 --> 02:37:41,850
Oh my gosh.

3498
02:37:42,210 --> 02:37:44,510
You're so sexy when you're concerned.

3499
02:37:45,830 --> 02:37:47,170
Wait, time is passing.

3500
02:37:48,210 --> 02:37:48,810
Oh.

3501
02:37:49,030 --> 02:37:50,430
Yeah, because he's dead.

3502
02:37:50,570 --> 02:37:50,750
Wait.

3503
02:37:51,210 --> 02:37:52,750
I don't think I can go back.

3504
02:37:55,290 --> 02:37:56,490
I can't.

3505
02:37:56,490 --> 02:37:58,230
I can't go back.

3506
02:37:58,610 --> 02:38:00,490
I can't use the phone right now.

3507
02:38:01,550 --> 02:38:04,070
Like I said, all women are like traps.

3508
02:38:05,450 --> 02:38:07,410
That and this are hardly related.

3509
02:38:07,730 --> 02:38:08,950
When in the past...

3510
02:38:08,950 --> 02:38:09,910
Oops.

3511
02:38:17,830 --> 02:38:22,630
This looks so similar to the room that was in that guy's basement.

3512
02:38:22,790 --> 02:38:23,930
In the junkyard.

3513
02:38:26,270 --> 02:38:28,190
I think we're just gonna die here.

3514
02:38:29,350 --> 02:38:30,050
Uh oh.

3515
02:38:30,350 --> 02:38:32,750
This woman doesn't show any signs of moving from her spot.

3516
02:38:33,130 --> 02:38:35,150
And I can't use the telephone line either.

3517
02:38:35,710 --> 02:38:37,150
Looks like I fell into a trap.

3518
02:38:37,630 --> 02:38:39,330
No, I knew what I was doing.

3519
02:38:39,830 --> 02:38:39,910
Oh.

3520
02:38:40,110 --> 02:38:42,170
All women are like traps.

3521
02:38:42,790 --> 02:38:44,010
Some are sweet traps.

3522
02:38:44,270 --> 02:38:45,070
Others are bitter.

3523
02:38:45,310 --> 02:38:46,730
Don't you understand that?

3524
02:38:47,930 --> 02:38:48,430
Okay.

3525
02:38:49,530 --> 02:38:52,050
I think I'd better rethink things here.

3526
02:38:54,810 --> 02:38:56,830
She's like really just...

3527
02:38:56,830 --> 02:38:58,370
She's like a statue.

3528
02:38:59,010 --> 02:39:00,730
She's just really thinking right there.

3529
02:39:00,890 --> 02:39:02,090
She's just really...

3530
02:39:04,410 --> 02:39:05,210
She's just...

3531
02:39:05,210 --> 02:39:07,530
She's just standing there.

3532
02:39:08,450 --> 02:39:10,390
She's really like...

3533
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:12,910
meditating so deeply.

3534
02:39:13,450 --> 02:39:13,590
Oh.

3535
02:39:13,770 --> 02:39:14,270
Three.

3536
02:39:18,130 --> 02:39:19,510
You can hit R to reset.

3537
02:39:19,830 --> 02:39:21,650
Yeah, but don't you want to spend more time with her?

3538
02:39:28,040 --> 02:39:29,120
I think he's dead.

3539
02:39:35,510 --> 02:39:38,170
It's so anticlimactic just sitting here.

3540
02:39:40,710 --> 02:39:43,210
It's so anticlimactic just sitting here.

3541
02:39:43,410 --> 02:39:43,890
It's so anticlimactic just sitting here.

3542
02:39:43,890 --> 02:39:43,910
It's so anticlimactic just sitting here.

3543
02:39:43,910 --> 02:39:44,550
You don't see anything.

3544
02:39:45,930 --> 02:39:46,410
Okay.

3545
02:39:46,490 --> 02:39:47,750
A mysterious kidnapping, eh?

3546
02:39:47,810 --> 02:39:49,610
I'd like to find out more about it.

3547
02:39:49,990 --> 02:39:52,270
But right now I have another problem to solve first.

3548
02:39:53,130 --> 02:39:55,610
Cause as little trouble for others as possible.

3549
02:39:55,830 --> 02:39:57,670
Now that's a rule to live by.

3550
02:39:58,170 --> 02:39:59,070
Never mind that.

3551
02:39:59,170 --> 02:39:59,890
Let's start over.

3552
02:40:01,030 --> 02:40:01,510
Okay.

3553
02:40:01,590 --> 02:40:02,410
From the beginning.

3554
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:10,080
Alright.

3555
02:40:11,660 --> 02:40:12,620
Trick Time.

3556
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:22,420
Oh, excuse me.

3557
02:40:24,980 --> 02:40:26,780
And now we can skip through all this.

3558
02:40:27,640 --> 02:40:29,680
Bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa.

3559
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:32,160
Bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa.

3560
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:34,720
Emma Papa, I mean Papa, help.

3561
02:40:34,980 --> 02:40:35,860
I'm gonna be killed.

3562
02:40:36,340 --> 02:40:37,800
Bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa.

3563
02:40:37,880 --> 02:40:38,740
I hate you, mommy.

3564
02:40:38,940 --> 02:40:40,420
Bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa.

3565
02:40:40,760 --> 02:40:41,960
Bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa.

3566
02:40:41,960 --> 02:40:42,860
Sexy voice.

3567
02:40:46,700 --> 02:40:47,460
Okay, good.

3568
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:49,320
Stay here.

3569
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:02,340
This is terrible.

3570
02:41:03,100 --> 02:41:03,760
Kidnapping, eh?

3571
02:41:04,040 --> 02:41:06,200
Once again, I'm not sure I know what the word means.

3572
02:41:07,100 --> 02:41:09,940
It's apparently the cause of the minister's attack.

3573
02:41:10,280 --> 02:41:12,240
I mean, it's in the name, Cecil.

3574
02:41:13,740 --> 02:41:15,160
They napped a kid!

3575
02:41:16,400 --> 02:41:18,100
I think it's in the name.

3576
02:41:18,980 --> 02:41:20,180
Oh, he's slow.

3577
02:41:23,940 --> 02:41:25,360
Such a useless man.

3578
02:41:25,800 --> 02:41:29,340
A useless man caught up in a useless case.

3579
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:31,200
Why doesn't he understand that?

3580
02:41:33,160 --> 02:41:35,360
Anyway, we only have four minutes.

3581
02:41:36,540 --> 02:41:38,680
I better do something about that medicine.

3582
02:41:40,180 --> 02:41:40,940
Let's see.

3583
02:41:42,420 --> 02:41:44,280
Wait, what is he doing now?

3584
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:45,120
Who is he talking to?

3585
02:41:45,160 --> 02:41:46,780
I have to call my wife.

3586
02:41:46,920 --> 02:41:48,140
I have to see if it's true.

3587
02:41:48,760 --> 02:41:50,420
Maybe they called the wrong person.

3588
02:41:51,020 --> 02:41:53,120
This minister doesn't accept the truth easily.

3589
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:54,540
Oh, that's right, she didn't pick up.

3590
02:41:55,020 --> 02:41:56,380
He's morally bankrupt.

3591
02:41:57,320 --> 02:42:00,100
Is putting a kid down for a nap a crime?

3592
02:42:03,540 --> 02:42:05,340
It's a crime against their free will.

3593
02:42:05,500 --> 02:42:06,840
What if they don't want to nap?

3594
02:42:07,820 --> 02:42:09,100
Actually, that's kind of crazy.

3595
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:10,500
Who wouldn't want to nap?

3596
02:42:12,420 --> 02:42:14,260
His wife won't answer for some reason.

3597
02:42:15,160 --> 02:42:16,440
A wife who doesn't answer her phone.

3598
02:42:16,660 --> 02:42:18,480
I think I know who that is.

3599
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:24,440
A morally bankrupt man deserves a morally bankrupt wife.

3600
02:42:25,860 --> 02:42:26,680
Kids, apparently.

3601
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:29,380
Why doesn't that man understand that?

3602
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:32,240
Now I'm sorry I ever brought this guy along.

3603
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:35,220
Me too, a little bit.

3604
02:42:38,600 --> 02:42:40,480
Let's examine the pills first.

3605
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:44,360
So this medicine stops the minister's attacks, eh?

3606
02:42:44,360 --> 02:42:47,060
If I could, I'd spill them onto his desk right now.

3607
02:42:47,280 --> 02:42:49,140
But unfortunately, I can't even open the cap.

3608
02:42:51,400 --> 02:42:53,480
What a shabby excuse for a man.

3609
02:42:54,220 --> 02:42:55,260
Thank you, thank you.

3610
02:42:55,520 --> 02:42:55,880
Kiss.

3611
02:42:56,500 --> 02:42:57,020
Kiss.

3612
02:42:59,140 --> 02:43:00,280
You're a simp.

3613
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:03,020
Sorry, you lost the gotcha.

3614
02:43:04,860 --> 02:43:05,820
But thank you.

3615
02:43:07,860 --> 02:43:11,920
He wears his important-looking uniform and sits working at his stately desk.

3616
02:43:12,080 --> 02:43:13,460
But what does he have inside?

3617
02:43:13,460 --> 02:43:14,020
Nothing.

3618
02:43:14,680 --> 02:43:17,040
A miserable, shabby excuse for a man.

3619
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:19,840
I think you have already said quite enough.

3620
02:43:21,180 --> 02:43:22,200
Uh, oh wait.

3621
02:43:29,420 --> 02:43:32,440
If only he could at least drink some of this water.

3622
02:43:32,720 --> 02:43:36,120
Too bad he knocks this pitcher to the floor at the end of his four minutes.

3623
02:43:37,120 --> 02:43:38,280
Such a stupid man.

3624
02:43:39,980 --> 02:43:42,540
Once water is spilled, there's no getting it back.

3625
02:43:42,820 --> 02:43:46,940
And knowing this full well, why do people still spill water pitchers?

3626
02:43:46,940 --> 02:43:48,120
So true.

3627
02:43:49,960 --> 02:43:50,740
So true.

3628
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:51,940
I don't know.

3629
02:43:52,160 --> 02:43:55,340
Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it?

3630
02:43:58,900 --> 02:44:00,240
Let's flap the flag.

3631
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:03,260
He doesn't notice.

3632
02:44:04,340 --> 02:44:05,440
He's so sad.

3633
02:44:07,140 --> 02:44:08,840
Why doesn't she answer?

3634
02:44:10,580 --> 02:44:15,980
I guess let's be the medicine bottle for now and see what we can do when he grabs us.

3635
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:26,680
Let's run.

3636
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:26,880
Otherwise, I'll say I planned this...

3637
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:26,980
Oh my god.

3638
02:44:34,290 --> 02:44:34,790
Come on.

3639
02:44:34,790 --> 02:44:37,410
Oh my god.

3640
02:44:38,590 --> 02:44:39,030
Come on.

3641
02:44:39,410 --> 02:44:42,290
Start coming to life.

3642
02:44:42,590 --> 02:44:43,030
Oh,

3643
02:44:47,110 --> 02:44:47,630
he's coming.

3644
02:44:49,650 --> 02:44:50,090
It's!

3645
02:44:50,530 --> 02:44:51,750
Oh my god.

3646
02:44:51,750 --> 02:44:52,290
I've been waiting for this.

3647
02:44:52,430 --> 02:44:52,790
Oh my god.

3648
02:44:56,210 --> 02:44:56,810
Swing the sword.

3649
02:44:56,810 --> 02:44:57,530
Raise the arm.

3650
02:44:58,810 --> 02:44:59,730
Oh my god.

3651
02:45:00,770 --> 02:45:04,130
Rock the basket.

3652
02:45:05,290 --> 02:45:06,130
Oh my god.

3653
02:45:06,450 --> 02:45:07,050
Nice.

3654
02:45:08,250 --> 02:45:09,150
Swing the sword.

3655
02:45:12,720 --> 02:45:13,660
No, no, no.

3656
02:45:13,700 --> 02:45:14,040
Swing it.

3657
02:45:14,140 --> 02:45:17,160
I think he's dead.

3658
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:19,900
Swing the sword.

3659
02:45:20,080 --> 02:45:20,680
Again.

3660
02:45:25,460 --> 02:45:26,500
Oh, melons.

3661
02:45:26,500 --> 02:45:26,500
Oh, melons.

3662
02:45:28,680 --> 02:45:29,760
Undo the hangar!

3663
02:45:31,500 --> 02:45:32,340
He's dead.

3664
02:45:32,700 --> 02:45:33,800
He's so dead.

3665
02:45:39,490 --> 02:45:42,670
Okay, well now we know that some of these things don't work.

3666
02:45:44,770 --> 02:45:45,750
Okay, let's see.

3667
02:45:45,950 --> 02:45:49,010
I thought that maybe swinging it would like...

3668
02:45:49,010 --> 02:45:49,830
Okay, hold on.

3669
02:45:50,130 --> 02:45:55,650
Do I really have just that short of a time frame?

3670
02:45:55,650 --> 02:45:57,190
To get this?

3671
02:45:57,450 --> 02:45:58,450
It's kind of crazy.

3672
02:46:00,130 --> 02:46:00,890
Oh,

3673
02:46:05,360 --> 02:46:06,380
it's already happening?

3674
02:46:07,620 --> 02:46:08,380
Okay.

3675
02:46:17,270 --> 02:46:18,030
Pew!

3676
02:46:18,810 --> 02:46:19,570
Okay.

3677
02:46:21,310 --> 02:46:22,870
Let's see what we got here.

3678
02:46:23,090 --> 02:46:24,010
Raise the arm.

3679
02:46:24,890 --> 02:46:25,950
Thank you!

3680
02:46:28,270 --> 02:46:30,310
Turn the basket.

3681
02:46:37,970 --> 02:46:39,170
Rock the basket.

3682
02:46:42,150 --> 02:46:42,590
Oh!

3683
02:46:42,590 --> 02:46:43,470
I did something.

3684
02:46:47,180 --> 02:46:48,900
I'm not sure what that did actually.

3685
02:46:49,480 --> 02:46:50,760
I don't think that did anything.

3686
02:46:54,380 --> 02:46:58,680
It was an honor being able to play and verbally exchange words with you yesterday, Ghosty.

3687
02:46:58,720 --> 02:47:00,400
Sorry I couldn't save you from the facehugger.

3688
02:47:00,420 --> 02:47:01,760
My cookie tray wasn't strong enough.

3689
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:02,440
It's okay.

3690
02:47:02,600 --> 02:47:02,940
You tried.

3691
02:47:05,960 --> 02:47:06,840
Undo this.

3692
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:08,840
I don't think it does anything.

3693
02:47:09,340 --> 02:47:10,540
What am I supposed to do here?

3694
02:47:10,660 --> 02:47:10,760
Okay.

3695
02:47:10,820 --> 02:47:13,640
Next time, let's just...

3696
02:47:16,620 --> 02:47:19,560
Next time, let's stick around with him.

3697
02:47:19,860 --> 02:47:20,260
Maybe.

3698
02:47:26,480 --> 02:47:27,520
What does the curtain do?

3699
02:47:27,700 --> 02:47:28,220
I don't know.

3700
02:47:28,280 --> 02:47:29,220
I can't even reach it.

3701
02:47:34,060 --> 02:47:36,880
Maybe let's see if there's anything we can do with the water.

3702
02:47:45,380 --> 02:47:45,820
Okay.

3703
02:47:45,820 --> 02:47:47,180
It starts to die.

3704
02:47:48,620 --> 02:47:49,380
Starts to die.

3705
02:47:53,720 --> 02:47:55,880
This one was tough for me but I really liked it.

3706
02:47:59,740 --> 02:48:00,180
Okay.

3707
02:48:00,400 --> 02:48:00,760
Hold on.

3708
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:02,440
Is there anything?

3709
02:48:02,640 --> 02:48:03,380
There's a flag.

3710
02:48:03,480 --> 02:48:04,360
We can also flap.

3711
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:05,180
Does it do anything?

3712
02:48:06,060 --> 02:48:06,500
Oh!

3713
02:48:07,080 --> 02:48:07,480
Wait.

3714
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:09,320
Did that spook him?

3715
02:48:09,420 --> 02:48:10,080
Actually, I'm not sure.

3716
02:48:11,880 --> 02:48:12,320
Oh.

3717
02:48:20,080 --> 02:48:21,040
There's like...

3718
02:48:21,720 --> 02:48:22,280
Oh.

3719
02:48:26,100 --> 02:48:27,420
Can't use the phones.

3720
02:48:27,760 --> 02:48:28,320
Okay.

3721
02:48:28,420 --> 02:48:28,680
Okay.

3722
02:48:28,840 --> 02:48:30,560
Even though we knocked it off the thing.

3723
02:48:32,840 --> 02:48:34,140
Let's find another path.

3724
02:48:34,460 --> 02:48:34,940
Sorry.

3725
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:35,980
There we go.

3726
02:48:38,500 --> 02:48:41,220
I thought we could stabilize it or something.

3727
02:48:41,960 --> 02:48:42,520
No.

3728
02:48:44,660 --> 02:48:45,220
Okay.

3729
02:48:46,640 --> 02:48:47,200
Okay.

3730
02:48:47,260 --> 02:48:48,740
I think we have to...

3731
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:50,700
Oh!

3732
02:48:50,720 --> 02:48:51,380
The flag now!

3733
02:48:52,580 --> 02:48:53,920
You guys are so smart.

3734
02:48:55,860 --> 02:48:57,820
The flag to stabilize it.

3735
02:48:57,840 --> 02:48:58,840
The flag to be like...

3736
02:48:58,840 --> 02:49:00,840
Make it go.

3737
02:49:02,400 --> 02:49:03,000
Okay.

3738
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:08,940
So I was on the right path with the flag, I think.

3739
02:49:09,360 --> 02:49:09,960
Okay.

3740
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:10,240
Okay.

3741
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:10,480
Okay.

3742
02:49:12,920 --> 02:49:14,380
I have another mango.

3743
02:49:14,660 --> 02:49:15,260
Hello.

3744
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:27,240
But that did not even work.

3745
02:49:30,300 --> 02:49:31,240
Reach for it!

3746
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:36,280
But that did not even work.

3747
02:49:36,280 --> 02:49:36,560
There it is!

3748
02:49:41,140 --> 02:49:43,060
Everything else was a red herring.

3749
02:49:45,180 --> 02:49:46,420
Well, I was thinking initially.

3750
02:49:46,620 --> 02:49:47,140
I was like...

3751
02:49:49,220 --> 02:49:50,860
Somehow getting the mango...

3752
02:49:50,860 --> 02:49:51,280
Somehow getting the mango...

3753
02:49:51,280 --> 02:49:53,220
on the sword and then...

3754
02:49:53,220 --> 02:49:53,640
on the sword and then...

3755
02:49:54,980 --> 02:49:55,800
golfing it over.

3756
02:49:55,960 --> 02:49:56,400
golfing it over.

3757
02:49:56,400 --> 02:49:56,840
Putting it over.

3758
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:57,340
But...

3759
02:49:58,380 --> 02:49:58,860
Putting it over.

3760
02:49:58,860 --> 02:49:58,860
But...

3761
02:49:59,740 --> 02:50:00,220
Putting it over.

3762
02:50:00,220 --> 02:50:00,220
But...

3763
02:50:03,440 --> 02:50:04,680
But I couldn't do that.

3764
02:50:05,620 --> 02:50:08,660
And there wasn't anything else over there that would really let me do.

3765
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:11,460
I was confused.

3766
02:50:13,100 --> 02:50:13,540
There.

3767
02:50:13,580 --> 02:50:14,100
That should help.

3768
02:50:14,380 --> 02:50:15,920
At least he's now had some water.

3769
02:50:18,380 --> 02:50:18,820
Okay.

3770
02:50:18,840 --> 02:50:19,260
All good.

3771
02:50:20,360 --> 02:50:21,500
He's still breathing, apparently.

3772
02:50:22,980 --> 02:50:24,900
But he looks far from recovered, unfortunately.

3773
02:50:26,140 --> 02:50:27,660
Such a wishy-washy man.

3774
02:50:29,380 --> 02:50:31,920
He can't make up his mind whether to live or die.

3775
02:50:31,920 --> 02:50:33,380
Oh my god.

3776
02:50:34,240 --> 02:50:34,660
Okay.

3777
02:50:36,660 --> 02:50:39,480
At least now I bought some time to get his medicine to him.

3778
02:50:39,900 --> 02:50:41,300
But how do I get over there, actually?

3779
02:50:42,400 --> 02:50:42,820
Um...

3780
02:50:49,410 --> 02:50:50,990
Wait, now how do I get over there?

3781
02:50:52,570 --> 02:50:52,990
Oh...

3782
02:50:54,310 --> 02:50:54,730
Flap.

3783
02:50:55,250 --> 02:50:55,670
No.

3784
02:50:57,790 --> 02:50:59,090
Wait, how do I get over there?

3785
02:50:59,370 --> 02:51:01,030
The minister's fate has changed.

3786
02:51:01,130 --> 02:51:02,790
But the situation still seems the same.

3787
02:51:03,090 --> 02:51:04,330
I can't move anywhere now.

3788
02:51:04,610 --> 02:51:05,510
Did I miss something?

3789
02:51:05,510 --> 02:51:06,810
I think I saw a path.

3790
02:51:07,110 --> 02:51:09,550
Just for a second while the minister was drinking the water.

3791
02:51:12,690 --> 02:51:14,770
A path while he was drinking the water.

3792
02:51:16,030 --> 02:51:17,510
Maybe I should start over from the beginning.

3793
02:51:17,690 --> 02:51:18,710
Come on!

3794
02:51:19,050 --> 02:51:19,430
Sisoul!

3795
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:23,130
Wait, while he was drinking the water?

3796
02:51:29,110 --> 02:51:29,690
Wait, no.

3797
02:51:29,790 --> 02:51:31,250
But I have to do from the beginning, right?

3798
02:51:32,310 --> 02:51:33,110
I can't do it.

3799
02:51:33,110 --> 02:51:33,410
Wait.

3800
02:51:33,910 --> 02:51:34,410
Hold on.

3801
02:51:34,470 --> 02:51:35,390
What's the fate change?

3802
02:51:36,570 --> 02:51:37,410
Is it while he...

3803
02:51:37,410 --> 02:51:39,090
When he grabs the water or...

3804
02:51:40,770 --> 02:51:41,250
No.

3805
02:51:41,370 --> 02:51:41,670
Okay.

3806
02:51:41,830 --> 02:51:42,690
From the beginning.

3807
02:51:44,010 --> 02:51:44,490
Okay.

3808
02:51:53,060 --> 02:51:53,540
I...

3809
02:51:54,360 --> 02:51:56,140
Maybe it has something to do with the papers.

3810
02:51:56,220 --> 02:51:58,460
Maybe like a paper flew and I didn't realize it.

3811
02:51:58,760 --> 02:52:00,880
Yeah, because that's the only other thing we can highlight.

3812
02:52:01,280 --> 02:52:02,200
Or the documents.

3813
02:52:04,100 --> 02:52:04,580
Okay.

3814
02:52:04,700 --> 02:52:06,800
Let's hang out in the flag for now.

3815
02:52:08,080 --> 02:52:09,640
It's a split second, but it's there.

3816
02:52:10,060 --> 02:52:10,940
I missed it.

3817
02:52:10,980 --> 02:52:11,460
I missed it.

3818
02:52:11,460 --> 02:52:11,640
I missed it.

3819
02:52:15,160 --> 02:52:16,200
Oh, my God!

3820
02:52:17,120 --> 02:52:17,220
I'm out of control!

3821
02:52:20,020 --> 02:52:20,040
I am out of control.

3822
02:52:20,040 --> 02:52:21,020
Okay, I'm ready.

3823
02:52:22,260 --> 02:52:23,780
I'm ready to flap.

3824
02:52:24,020 --> 02:52:24,860
I'm ready to flap.

3825
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:25,680
I'm ready to flap!

3826
02:52:27,320 --> 02:52:28,400
Reach for it!

3827
02:52:28,500 --> 02:52:29,520
Oh, that was too early.

3828
02:52:29,860 --> 02:52:30,880
Reach for it!

3829
02:52:37,760 --> 02:52:39,100
Oh, come on!

3830
02:52:42,780 --> 02:52:43,300
No!

3831
02:52:45,820 --> 02:52:48,700
This guy is too clumsy.

3832
02:52:48,820 --> 02:52:49,540
He's stinking.

3833
02:52:49,540 --> 02:52:50,980
He's making butterfingers over here.

3834
02:52:51,800 --> 02:52:53,100
What's wrong with you?

3835
02:52:53,160 --> 02:52:54,500
Maybe he's right.

3836
02:52:54,780 --> 02:52:55,980
Maybe his ghost self is right.

3837
02:52:56,240 --> 02:52:57,220
Wishy washy man.

3838
02:52:57,640 --> 02:52:59,000
Do you want to live or do you want to die?

3839
02:53:05,400 --> 02:53:06,440
La la la.

3840
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:08,700
Okay.

3841
02:53:08,820 --> 02:53:09,700
I'm ready to flap.

3842
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:13,700
Okay.

3843
02:53:19,150 --> 02:53:20,410
Once it's spinning around.

3844
02:53:20,770 --> 02:53:21,730
Once it's spinning around.

3845
02:53:24,210 --> 02:53:24,730
Flap!

3846
02:53:25,130 --> 02:53:25,870
There we go.

3847
02:53:26,170 --> 02:53:26,690
Okay.

3848
02:53:27,490 --> 02:53:28,850
Now let's go to the papers.

3849
02:53:58,430 --> 02:54:00,030
It was the picture.

3850
02:54:00,590 --> 02:54:02,670
Oh I thought when he went crazy.

3851
02:54:02,770 --> 02:54:05,290
I thought maybe a piece of paper flew off.

3852
02:54:07,050 --> 02:54:08,910
I gotta go to the picture.

3853
02:54:09,890 --> 02:54:12,830
I thought I missed a piece of paper flying in the wind.

3854
02:54:14,890 --> 02:54:17,030
Why people are being like why papers?

3855
02:54:17,230 --> 02:54:18,910
I said this from the very beginning.

3856
02:54:18,970 --> 02:54:19,650
I was like okay.

3857
02:54:19,730 --> 02:54:22,310
Once he lifts the water.

3858
02:54:22,550 --> 02:54:23,810
I'm gonna go to the papers.

3859
02:54:23,890 --> 02:54:24,690
And see if I.

3860
02:54:26,630 --> 02:54:28,330
Why did you do that?

3861
02:54:28,450 --> 02:54:29,870
You stupid ghost.

3862
02:54:30,250 --> 02:54:31,810
When I said it from the beginning.

3863
02:54:31,990 --> 02:54:33,430
That's what I was going to do.

3864
02:54:35,870 --> 02:54:36,350
I.

3865
02:54:40,330 --> 02:54:42,130
Why did you do the thing that you said.

3866
02:54:42,190 --> 02:54:43,250
That you were going to try.

3867
02:54:44,350 --> 02:54:44,930
Okay.

3868
02:54:46,590 --> 02:54:47,770
Reach for the water.

3869
02:54:50,690 --> 02:54:51,270
Flap!

3870
02:54:52,070 --> 02:54:52,650
Okay.

3871
02:54:52,790 --> 02:54:53,350
Picture time.

3872
02:54:56,910 --> 02:54:57,490
Okay.

3873
02:55:01,650 --> 02:55:02,610
Spin harder.

3874
02:55:04,990 --> 02:55:07,850
And then it will probably blow the paper.

3875
02:55:11,850 --> 02:55:13,210
There that should help.

3876
02:55:13,370 --> 02:55:13,810
Blah blah blah.

3877
02:55:14,230 --> 02:55:14,590
Okay.

3878
02:55:15,330 --> 02:55:16,770
Wait if I spin harder.

3879
02:55:17,730 --> 02:55:19,110
How am I going to.

3880
02:55:19,370 --> 02:55:20,590
We read all of this.

3881
02:55:21,250 --> 02:55:22,450
How am I going to.

3882
02:55:32,430 --> 02:55:33,750
There we go.

3883
02:55:36,070 --> 02:55:37,310
There we go.

3884
02:55:37,310 --> 02:55:37,530
Oh.

3885
02:55:38,350 --> 02:55:39,170
How nice.

3886
02:55:40,370 --> 02:55:40,810
Alright.

3887
02:55:40,930 --> 02:55:41,830
Now we are here.

3888
02:55:42,350 --> 02:55:43,310
We are at the medicine.

3889
02:55:44,230 --> 02:55:45,950
Time for the next step.

3890
02:55:47,750 --> 02:55:49,130
About this medicine bottle.

3891
02:55:51,490 --> 02:55:53,810
The minister is going to make a full recovery.

3892
02:55:54,030 --> 02:55:55,590
I have to deliver this thing to him.

3893
02:55:55,930 --> 02:55:57,870
How is a ghost with no hands or feet.

3894
02:55:58,150 --> 02:55:58,590
Hey.

3895
02:55:59,350 --> 02:56:01,410
My hands are like this because I'm a ghost.

3896
02:56:02,150 --> 02:56:03,050
Supposed to do that.

3897
02:56:03,330 --> 02:56:05,550
I guess I'll just have to use my head instead.

3898
02:56:07,570 --> 02:56:08,210
Let's see.

3899
02:56:09,210 --> 02:56:09,750
Let's see.

3900
02:56:10,910 --> 02:56:12,150
Let's raise this.

3901
02:56:12,330 --> 02:56:13,190
Raise the roof.

3902
02:56:14,430 --> 02:56:14,970
Lower.

3903
02:56:18,190 --> 02:56:19,170
Oh okay.

3904
02:56:19,450 --> 02:56:20,490
I was going to say.

3905
02:56:21,110 --> 02:56:21,650
Okay.

3906
02:56:22,110 --> 02:56:23,090
I was going to.

3907
02:56:23,210 --> 02:56:24,490
Oh wait I can reach this now.

3908
02:56:24,750 --> 02:56:25,110
Never mind.

3909
02:56:25,470 --> 02:56:26,450
Close the curtain.

3910
02:56:27,090 --> 02:56:28,290
Time is passing.

3911
02:56:28,930 --> 02:56:29,470
Okay.

3912
02:56:37,590 --> 02:56:38,190
Spin.

3913
02:56:40,370 --> 02:56:40,970
Spin.

3914
02:56:41,230 --> 02:56:42,930
I'm not quite sure what to do.

3915
02:56:43,230 --> 02:56:43,830
Spin.

3916
02:56:45,270 --> 02:56:45,870
Oh.

3917
02:56:46,330 --> 02:56:47,550
Wrong way.

3918
02:56:47,950 --> 02:56:48,550
Maybe.

3919
02:56:49,690 --> 02:56:50,290
Roll.

3920
02:56:52,170 --> 02:56:52,770
Oh.

3921
02:56:59,440 --> 02:57:00,040
Good.

3922
02:57:01,400 --> 02:57:02,000
Undo.

3923
02:57:03,560 --> 02:57:04,160
Okay.

3924
02:57:04,240 --> 02:57:07,580
I'm just fumbling around right now you guys.

3925
02:57:07,680 --> 02:57:08,200
Hold on.

3926
02:57:10,560 --> 02:57:11,980
I'm fumbling around a little bit.

3927
02:57:12,040 --> 02:57:12,920
Let me see what I can do.

3928
02:57:13,340 --> 02:57:14,800
Let me see what's possible.

3929
02:57:16,310 --> 02:57:16,600
Um.

3930
02:57:17,640 --> 02:57:18,840
Rock the boat.

3931
02:57:20,340 --> 02:57:20,920
Melon.

3932
02:57:28,880 --> 02:57:29,460
Aha.

3933
02:57:29,980 --> 02:57:30,560
Okay.

3934
02:57:30,700 --> 02:57:30,980
Okay.

3935
02:57:31,340 --> 02:57:31,920
So.

3936
02:57:34,400 --> 02:57:37,020
I roll the globe.

3937
02:57:38,700 --> 02:57:39,280
No.

3938
02:57:42,020 --> 02:57:42,600
Yes?

3939
02:57:42,660 --> 02:57:42,880
Wait.

3940
02:57:44,660 --> 02:57:45,160
Uh.

3941
02:57:46,080 --> 02:57:46,580
Yeah.

3942
02:57:46,660 --> 02:57:47,780
I roll the globe.

3943
02:57:48,500 --> 02:57:50,260
And then I hit it with the melon.

3944
02:57:51,600 --> 02:57:52,800
Would it be the globe?

3945
02:57:52,880 --> 02:57:53,780
Or would it be the.

3946
02:57:54,400 --> 02:57:55,400
Well actually.

3947
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:57,700
It could be either the vase or the globe.

3948
02:57:58,580 --> 02:57:59,620
I'm not quite sure.

3949
02:58:00,980 --> 02:58:02,680
I think I need to restart though.

3950
02:58:06,160 --> 02:58:07,720
Cause I don't have a thing.

3951
02:58:08,340 --> 02:58:09,140
To roll.

3952
02:58:10,780 --> 02:58:11,960
I don't have.

3953
02:58:11,960 --> 02:58:12,980
Um.

3954
02:58:14,280 --> 02:58:15,320
But I need.

3955
02:58:15,740 --> 02:58:17,440
The globe to drop.

3956
02:58:18,380 --> 02:58:19,840
To knock down.

3957
02:58:20,160 --> 02:58:21,180
The vase.

3958
02:58:44,620 --> 02:58:47,240
I don't think it's supposed to be a catapult.

3959
02:58:48,040 --> 02:58:49,580
I think it's supposed to be.

3960
02:58:50,500 --> 02:58:51,140
Like.

3961
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:51,760
Like.

3962
02:58:51,960 --> 02:58:52,860
Hold on.

3963
02:58:52,920 --> 02:58:55,540
The globe drops from here.

3964
02:58:55,780 --> 02:58:56,960
And rolls onto here.

3965
02:58:57,160 --> 02:58:58,240
And then rolls down.

3966
02:58:58,240 --> 02:58:59,360
And then.

3967
02:58:59,620 --> 02:59:01,080
When it gets to this side.

3968
02:59:01,400 --> 02:59:03,420
We use the melon to.

3969
02:59:04,320 --> 02:59:04,800
To.

3970
02:59:05,700 --> 02:59:06,180
Wait.

3971
02:59:08,700 --> 02:59:10,140
I'm not so sure actually.

3972
02:59:11,420 --> 02:59:11,900
Swing.

3973
02:59:17,290 --> 02:59:18,690
Take all the time you need.

3974
02:59:19,550 --> 02:59:20,310
I don't.

3975
02:59:20,430 --> 02:59:21,550
I don't have time.

3976
02:59:21,970 --> 02:59:22,750
Let's see what they say.

3977
02:59:23,090 --> 02:59:24,190
That was so close.

3978
02:59:24,510 --> 02:59:26,830
If the swing just had a little more reach to it.

3979
02:59:26,830 --> 02:59:27,730
I think it'd be.

3980
02:59:28,490 --> 02:59:30,790
I think I'd better look for something else.

3981
02:59:32,750 --> 02:59:33,050
Oh.

3982
02:59:51,160 --> 02:59:51,840
Uh oh.

3983
02:59:52,880 --> 02:59:53,480
Okay.

3984
02:59:59,700 --> 03:00:02,260
I'm gonna try spinning the globe next time.

3985
03:00:02,860 --> 03:00:03,800
And seeing.

3986
03:00:05,360 --> 03:00:06,580
If that works.

3987
03:00:07,800 --> 03:00:08,700
Goodbye mister.

3988
03:00:11,800 --> 03:00:13,600
From the fate change.

3989
03:00:13,920 --> 03:00:14,320
Okay.

3990
03:00:16,840 --> 03:00:17,440
Okay.

3991
03:00:17,540 --> 03:00:17,860
Okay.

3992
03:00:21,320 --> 03:00:21,840
Spin.

3993
03:00:22,560 --> 03:00:23,080
Harder.

3994
03:00:25,120 --> 03:00:25,640
Alright.

3995
03:00:25,700 --> 03:00:26,100
Here we go.

3996
03:00:30,440 --> 03:00:30,960
Alrighty.

3997
03:00:31,560 --> 03:00:32,700
I'm going ghost.

3998
03:00:42,950 --> 03:00:43,470
No.

3999
03:00:59,870 --> 03:01:01,370
I think this is the order.

4000
03:01:01,430 --> 03:01:02,810
The order that I did before.

4001
03:01:03,070 --> 03:01:04,670
I think is correct.

4002
03:01:05,330 --> 03:01:06,190
Because otherwise.

4003
03:01:06,190 --> 03:01:08,110
The painting will be facing.

4004
03:01:08,230 --> 03:01:09,330
Slanted this way.

4005
03:01:10,250 --> 03:01:11,930
And that won't help me with.

4006
03:01:13,930 --> 03:01:14,890
That won't help.

4007
03:01:15,010 --> 03:01:16,750
It'll just fly over the medicine.

4008
03:01:19,910 --> 03:01:21,630
It'll fly over the medicine right?

4009
03:01:22,490 --> 03:01:23,050
So.

4010
03:01:24,810 --> 03:01:25,930
Let's close this.

4011
03:01:30,360 --> 03:01:31,360
Raise the roof.

4012
03:01:34,980 --> 03:01:35,540
Salute.

4013
03:01:38,140 --> 03:01:38,740
Turn around.

4014
03:01:38,880 --> 03:01:39,460
No wait.

4015
03:01:39,620 --> 03:01:40,680
I didn't turn before.

4016
03:01:42,540 --> 03:01:43,100
Pause.

4017
03:01:52,370 --> 03:01:52,930
Spin.

4018
03:01:54,450 --> 03:01:55,370
See what happens here.

4019
03:01:55,930 --> 03:01:56,110
Ah.

4020
03:02:01,360 --> 03:02:03,740
But this can knock this over.

4021
03:02:04,120 --> 03:02:05,960
This one can get knocked over.

4022
03:02:07,160 --> 03:02:08,240
This one right here.

4023
03:02:27,640 --> 03:02:28,200
Wait.

4024
03:02:29,560 --> 03:02:30,500
Was it this way?

4025
03:02:31,580 --> 03:02:32,140
Wait.

4026
03:02:49,030 --> 03:02:49,530
Hold on.

4027
03:02:50,810 --> 03:02:51,210
Oh.

4028
03:02:57,050 --> 03:02:57,450
Wait.

4029
03:02:58,790 --> 03:02:59,190
Oh.

4030
03:03:01,270 --> 03:03:01,670
Oh.

4031
03:03:02,510 --> 03:03:02,910
Oh.

4032
03:03:04,830 --> 03:03:05,230
Oh.

4033
03:03:07,790 --> 03:03:09,850
That's exactly what I said I didn't want to happen.

4034
03:03:12,830 --> 03:03:14,330
Read the thought bubbles for hints.

4035
03:03:14,430 --> 03:03:14,750
I don't.

4036
03:03:14,750 --> 03:03:16,490
I'm purposefully not reading it.

4037
03:03:16,550 --> 03:03:17,370
Because I do not want to hint.

4038
03:03:18,090 --> 03:03:19,290
I want to figure it out.

4039
03:03:20,810 --> 03:03:21,850
I don't want to hint.

4040
03:03:21,850 --> 03:03:24,690
I'm trying to figure it out myself.

4041
03:03:24,970 --> 03:03:27,210
Though I already feel that I messed up.

4042
03:03:29,130 --> 03:03:30,190
Though I already feel that I messed up.

4043
03:03:30,190 --> 03:03:32,350
Though I feel that I already made a grave mistake.

4044
03:03:33,510 --> 03:03:34,030
Ah.

4045
03:03:38,590 --> 03:03:39,110
Globe.

4046
03:03:42,510 --> 03:03:43,030
Ok.

4047
03:03:51,880 --> 03:03:52,240
Ok.

4048
03:03:52,300 --> 03:03:52,520
Wait.

4049
03:03:52,660 --> 03:03:52,740
Wait.

4050
03:03:52,760 --> 03:03:52,900
Wait.

4051
03:03:54,060 --> 03:03:54,580
I...

4052
03:03:54,580 --> 03:03:55,240
Wait.

4053
03:04:01,740 --> 03:04:04,200
Well, like I said, if I do this...

4054
03:04:04,200 --> 03:04:05,820
If I... If i.

4055
03:04:05,820 --> 03:04:05,820
If I.

4056
03:04:05,840 --> 03:04:06,000
Why?

4057
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:09,160
Wait, if I do this... But then I...

4058
03:04:25,180 --> 03:04:26,060
Stop posting!

4059
03:04:26,400 --> 03:04:28,000
Stop posting the answers!

4060
03:04:28,660 --> 03:04:30,080
Stop posting the answers!

4061
03:04:30,120 --> 03:04:30,720
I'm not reading!

4062
03:04:32,680 --> 03:04:33,120
Stop!

4063
03:04:33,120 --> 03:04:33,320
Stop!

4064
03:04:33,440 --> 03:04:33,640
Stop!

4065
03:04:33,780 --> 03:04:34,020
Stop!

4066
03:04:34,120 --> 03:04:34,380
Stop!

4067
03:04:34,460 --> 03:04:34,720
Stop!

4068
03:04:34,780 --> 03:04:34,940
Stop!

4069
03:04:35,240 --> 03:04:36,680
I said no hints!

4070
03:04:36,760 --> 03:04:37,560
I said no hints!

4071
03:04:42,630 --> 03:04:43,610
Oh my god, time limit.

4072
03:04:52,530 --> 03:04:52,930
Okay.

4073
03:04:54,730 --> 03:04:55,670
Shut up, Sissel!

4074
03:04:55,710 --> 03:04:56,090
I know!

4075
03:04:56,210 --> 03:04:56,550
I know!

4076
03:04:56,630 --> 03:04:57,050
I know!

4077
03:04:57,070 --> 03:04:57,510
I know!

4078
03:04:57,570 --> 03:04:57,970
I know!

4079
03:04:57,990 --> 03:04:58,350
I know!

4080
03:04:59,130 --> 03:04:59,750
Let's see.

4081
03:05:40,100 --> 03:05:41,480
So many moving parts.

4082
03:05:41,540 --> 03:05:43,180
Honestly, a great puzzle to think through.

4083
03:05:43,500 --> 03:05:43,900
Yeah!

4084
03:05:44,700 --> 03:05:45,480
It is fun.

4085
03:05:45,600 --> 03:05:46,860
It's interesting for sure.

4086
03:05:49,880 --> 03:05:52,120
Okay, I feel like I'm just gonna have to try it.

4087
03:05:52,180 --> 03:05:52,980
And if it's not...

4088
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:54,100
If it's not the correct way, I...

4089
03:05:54,100 --> 03:05:56,580
Do it the opposite way, I guess?

4090
03:06:01,180 --> 03:06:01,960
I suppose.

4091
03:06:06,160 --> 03:06:06,920
Wait, wait, wait.

4092
03:06:07,480 --> 03:06:08,800
No, we want the...

4093
03:06:13,580 --> 03:06:14,020
Yeah...

4094
03:06:14,600 --> 03:06:15,660
No, wait, wait, wait.

4095
03:06:18,940 --> 03:06:19,820
Trial and error.

4096
03:06:20,240 --> 03:06:21,200
Exactly, exactly.

4097
03:06:22,160 --> 03:06:23,040
Because sometimes...

4098
03:06:23,560 --> 03:06:25,840
Something might not go as you predict it will.

4099
03:06:26,780 --> 03:06:28,200
And I'm just kind of confused.

4100
03:06:28,640 --> 03:06:29,220
Oh!

4101
03:06:29,600 --> 03:06:32,060
Oh, it's time, huh?

4102
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:33,840
Wow, it's so much fun.

4103
03:06:33,840 --> 03:06:35,880
This might be a good idea.

4104
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:37,160
Okay, let's see.

4105
03:06:37,160 --> 03:06:37,460
This is going to be very then.

4106
03:06:46,540 --> 03:06:47,480
I'm gonna do this.

4107
03:06:47,940 --> 03:06:48,260
I'm not doing it...

4108
03:06:48,260 --> 03:06:48,900
You get it?

4109
03:06:48,900 --> 03:06:49,220
Do you get it?

4110
03:06:49,240 --> 03:06:50,000
I don't know what to do.

4111
03:06:50,280 --> 03:06:51,160
I believe...

4112
03:06:51,160 --> 03:06:51,460
Okay, I got it.

4113
03:06:57,560 --> 03:06:58,240
Okay, let's see.

4114
03:06:59,420 --> 03:07:00,380
I feel...

4115
03:07:06,760 --> 03:07:09,480
I feel like the vase will just fly into the air.

4116
03:07:11,140 --> 03:07:12,120
Just try it?

4117
03:07:13,040 --> 03:07:14,180
Okay, you're right.

4118
03:07:14,400 --> 03:07:15,620
Might as well just try something.

4119
03:07:19,240 --> 03:07:19,720
Wait,

4120
03:07:25,680 --> 03:07:26,240
if I...

4121
03:07:27,780 --> 03:07:31,240
Oh no, I need to... I need to turn it.

4122
03:07:33,660 --> 03:07:35,300
And then I need to rock it.

4123
03:07:37,040 --> 03:07:37,840
Rock it, baby.

4124
03:07:39,440 --> 03:07:39,840
Okay.

4125
03:07:40,440 --> 03:07:43,080
And then if I go here and do this...

4126
03:07:44,400 --> 03:07:45,740
It's called thinking out loud.

4127
03:07:46,780 --> 03:07:48,460
I'm an out loud thinker.

4128
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:51,420
Why did the thought bubble come up?

4129
03:07:51,580 --> 03:07:52,500
It's scaring me.

4130
03:07:52,700 --> 03:07:54,180
It makes me feel like I did it wrong.

4131
03:07:56,120 --> 03:07:58,100
Okay, and now we go to here and here.

4132
03:07:59,700 --> 03:08:00,860
And to there.

4133
03:08:02,300 --> 03:08:03,120
And knock you down.

4134
03:08:04,840 --> 03:08:06,720
Time is passing.

4135
03:08:07,140 --> 03:08:08,540
And then we...

4136
03:08:10,880 --> 03:08:15,560
When I turned it around, it still knocked over the vase, didn't it?

4137
03:08:17,180 --> 03:08:18,220
I think so.

4138
03:08:19,620 --> 03:08:20,300
Spin!

4139
03:08:22,020 --> 03:08:22,360
Oh!

4140
03:08:24,260 --> 03:08:24,940
What?

4141
03:08:25,020 --> 03:08:25,560
Roll?

4142
03:08:32,460 --> 03:08:33,140
Oh!

4143
03:08:34,420 --> 03:08:35,900
Wait, can I roll that?

4144
03:08:35,900 --> 03:08:37,540
No, I can't roll that.

4145
03:08:37,700 --> 03:08:38,220
Oh, wait.

4146
03:08:40,820 --> 03:08:42,840
Oh, wait, am I catapulting it?

4147
03:08:42,960 --> 03:08:44,960
Am I catapulting?

4148
03:08:48,240 --> 03:08:49,140
Wait, hold on.

4149
03:08:49,260 --> 03:08:49,920
I need more time.

4150
03:08:50,040 --> 03:08:51,440
Don't rush me, game.

4151
03:08:54,440 --> 03:08:57,080
Wait, so if I put this in the middle.

4152
03:08:57,920 --> 03:08:58,660
This vase.

4153
03:09:00,480 --> 03:09:01,760
And roll this here.

4154
03:09:01,760 --> 03:09:04,440
And then, that knocks down.

4155
03:09:05,560 --> 03:09:07,400
This catapults the globe.

4156
03:09:08,420 --> 03:09:09,500
Okay, let's try that.

4157
03:09:11,720 --> 03:09:13,180
After the fate change!

4158
03:09:15,400 --> 03:09:17,080
After the fate change!

4159
03:09:19,820 --> 03:09:21,360
Oh, spin harder.

4160
03:09:21,580 --> 03:09:22,700
Spin harder!

4161
03:09:22,840 --> 03:09:23,940
Spin harder!

4162
03:09:25,380 --> 03:09:26,020
Okay.

4163
03:09:35,800 --> 03:09:36,680
Beep, beep, beep.

4164
03:09:36,740 --> 03:09:37,040
Blah, blah, blah.

4165
03:09:37,320 --> 03:09:38,300
Beep, beep, beep.

4166
03:09:38,340 --> 03:09:38,640
Blah, blah, blah.

4167
03:09:39,380 --> 03:09:40,020
Beep, beep, beep.

4168
03:09:41,760 --> 03:09:57,160
So we go and then that also makes it so that falls on the melon falls oh wait no we have to have this fall down instead of the melon oh wait i want to go up i want to go up real quick

4169
03:10:00,740 --> 03:10:07,660
we undo this guy a little undo a little screws loose

4170
03:10:13,960 --> 03:10:15,000
Okay.

4171
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:16,040
Okay.

4172
03:10:33,120 --> 03:10:34,440
This way.

4173
03:10:35,080 --> 03:10:36,120
Spin!

4174
03:10:37,240 --> 03:10:42,090
It went the wrong way.

4175
03:10:43,470 --> 03:10:46,330
It went the wrong way!

4176
03:10:56,410 --> 03:10:57,650
Oh my god.

4177
03:11:02,410 --> 03:11:03,950
I remember getting tricked by that too.

4178
03:11:04,210 --> 03:11:06,250
Yeah, it's a little... it feels like a little...

4179
03:11:07,550 --> 03:11:16,850
Like, not misleading I think is the wrong word, but you kind of like... your brain thinks like, oh if it's facing the direction of the vase, then it will go to the direction of the vase.

4180
03:11:17,010 --> 03:11:17,470
You know what I mean?

4181
03:11:23,600 --> 03:11:24,040
Okay.

4182
03:11:24,040 --> 03:11:28,140
If it didn't take so much to get there, it wouldn't have been an issue.

4183
03:11:31,140 --> 03:11:37,040
I wish I could turn off the intensity of the ghost trick effect, you know?

4184
03:11:37,080 --> 03:11:41,420
That's the only thing that makes me... You know what?

4185
03:11:41,440 --> 03:11:43,600
I will turn this while we're here.

4186
03:11:47,880 --> 03:11:49,040
I will turn that.

4187
03:11:49,440 --> 03:11:53,320
Oh, I unlocked a bunch of stuff, but I don't know why.

4188
03:11:53,460 --> 03:11:55,540
I just unlocked it now, but okay.

4189
03:11:57,860 --> 03:11:59,020
Time is passing.

4190
03:11:59,140 --> 03:11:59,840
I'm working.

4191
03:11:59,840 --> 03:12:00,740
Okay,

4192
03:12:05,560 --> 03:12:07,040
now we turn it.

4193
03:12:07,940 --> 03:12:10,360
And then we spin it.

4194
03:12:15,420 --> 03:12:18,200
Okay, then we drop it like it's hot.

4195
03:12:19,560 --> 03:12:20,160
Time

4196
03:12:38,320 --> 03:12:38,980
is passing.

4197
03:12:39,420 --> 03:12:39,920
Wait.

4198
03:12:41,340 --> 03:12:42,820
Then we drop the globe.

4199
03:12:43,060 --> 03:12:44,020
Okay, I'm sorry.

4200
03:12:45,300 --> 03:12:45,900
Wait.

4201
03:12:50,750 --> 03:12:55,510
Wait, we drop the globe and then we drop the... drop the other vase, right?

4202
03:12:59,710 --> 03:13:00,390
Spin it!

4203
03:13:00,510 --> 03:13:01,170
Tap it!

4204
03:13:02,390 --> 03:13:02,990
Bonk it!

4205
03:13:03,150 --> 03:13:03,790
Twirl it!

4206
03:13:04,570 --> 03:13:05,690
I think so, yeah?

4207
03:13:05,790 --> 03:13:06,190
Right.

4208
03:13:11,050 --> 03:13:12,230
And then we... yeah.

4209
03:13:12,410 --> 03:13:15,670
And then we will go back and we would launch the globe.

4210
03:13:22,490 --> 03:13:23,830
I sure hope this works.

4211
03:13:24,750 --> 03:13:25,710
Oh wait, not turn.

4212
03:13:26,850 --> 03:13:27,290
Rock.

4213
03:13:30,590 --> 03:13:31,050
Woo!

4214
03:13:39,730 --> 03:13:40,650
Ah, yippee!

4215
03:13:41,830 --> 03:13:42,290
My

4216
03:13:48,360 --> 03:13:48,780
medicine!

4217
03:13:53,100 --> 03:13:54,060
Oh my god.

4218
03:13:54,180 --> 03:13:54,460
Whoa.

4219
03:13:54,660 --> 03:13:56,180
I don't think that's gonna help you, mister.

4220
03:13:56,800 --> 03:13:58,220
I don't think that's gonna help you.

4221
03:13:58,280 --> 03:13:58,960
Help you!

4222
03:14:00,320 --> 03:14:02,160
The minister finally took his medicine.

4223
03:14:02,300 --> 03:14:05,180
Okay, it took me a minute to get that, but we finally got there.

4224
03:14:05,920 --> 03:14:06,380
Yippee!

4225
03:14:08,560 --> 03:14:11,000
I think maybe he took too much medicine.

4226
03:14:12,620 --> 03:14:13,900
Such a greedy man.

4227
03:14:15,200 --> 03:14:17,600
He's supposed to take two capsules with water.

4228
03:14:17,980 --> 03:14:19,380
Why doesn't he know that?

4229
03:14:20,220 --> 03:14:21,920
Aw, cut the guy some slack.

4230
03:14:22,340 --> 03:14:22,840
There.

4231
03:14:23,780 --> 03:14:24,500
Oh, there.

4232
03:14:24,620 --> 03:14:24,920
See?

4233
03:14:26,740 --> 03:14:28,060
He took his meds.

4234
03:14:28,060 --> 03:14:29,100
Everyone be like him.

4235
03:14:33,180 --> 03:14:35,220
Too much medicine challenge.

4236
03:14:40,210 --> 03:14:42,390
We saw all of them go into his mouth.

4237
03:14:42,710 --> 03:14:46,070
But we don't know if he swallowed all of them.

4238
03:14:51,410 --> 03:14:52,910
That was a lot of work.

4239
03:14:52,990 --> 03:14:53,730
Yeah, it was.

4240
03:14:53,990 --> 03:14:54,890
You're telling me.

4241
03:14:55,430 --> 03:14:57,590
Well, hopefully this taught him a lesson.

4242
03:14:58,210 --> 03:14:58,690
Huh?

4243
03:14:59,390 --> 03:15:02,530
He greatly underestimated his dependence on his medicine.

4244
03:15:02,750 --> 03:15:05,030
I hope he learned something from this experience.

4245
03:15:07,250 --> 03:15:08,670
First, know yourself.

4246
03:15:08,950 --> 03:15:10,570
That is the key to everything.

4247
03:15:11,670 --> 03:15:14,190
I think you need to listen to your own advice, buddy.

4248
03:15:14,730 --> 03:15:16,050
Anyway, let's go back to work.

4249
03:15:16,070 --> 03:15:16,770
To the world of the present.

4250
03:15:22,390 --> 03:15:23,710
Take your meds.

4251
03:15:29,270 --> 03:15:32,250
And so the Justice Minister is now back to life.

4252
03:15:32,510 --> 03:15:35,170
But the furrows on his brow are even deeper now.

4253
03:15:37,790 --> 03:15:38,910
Oh, Lin!

4254
03:15:39,190 --> 03:15:43,250
And apparently our Lady Detective is the present cause of those furrows.

4255
03:15:47,250 --> 03:15:48,110
Look, Detective.

4256
03:15:48,510 --> 03:15:50,590
He was sentenced after a fair trial.

4257
03:15:50,830 --> 03:15:52,850
And the man himself wants to be executed.

4258
03:15:54,650 --> 03:15:56,290
But there was no evidence!

4259
03:15:56,670 --> 03:15:58,430
All they had was his own confession!

4260
03:16:00,110 --> 03:16:02,030
But it was no ordinary confession.

4261
03:16:02,450 --> 03:16:03,930
It was the confession...

4262
03:16:05,790 --> 03:16:07,410
of an esteemed detective.

4263
03:16:09,330 --> 03:16:10,710
Well, stay back!

4264
03:16:10,990 --> 03:16:14,030
I told you I don't want anybody coming near me.

4265
03:16:14,990 --> 03:16:16,230
Okay, you're sensitive.

4266
03:16:17,630 --> 03:16:19,490
Mr. Minister, please listen to me!

4267
03:16:19,710 --> 03:16:22,770
I might be able to gather new evidence in that case, too!

4268
03:16:24,590 --> 03:16:25,070
What?

4269
03:16:26,730 --> 03:16:29,370
So please, please, just give me a little more time!

4270
03:16:33,290 --> 03:16:35,290
I just got a call from the prison.

4271
03:16:35,570 --> 03:16:38,170
Your death row convict apparently just escaped.

4272
03:16:40,550 --> 03:16:44,430
Unfortunately, after all this time, it seems he now wants to dodge his punishment.

4273
03:16:45,550 --> 03:16:46,030
But...

4274
03:16:46,930 --> 03:16:49,790
When he is apprehended, his sentence will be carried out.

4275
03:16:49,810 --> 03:16:51,450
Well, he got apprehended, like, really fast.

4276
03:16:51,690 --> 03:16:52,170
So...

4277
03:16:53,230 --> 03:16:53,870
Tonight.

4278
03:16:55,270 --> 03:16:55,910
No...

4279
03:16:59,070 --> 03:17:03,850
But when the sentence was handed down, you were against enforcing the death penalty!

4280
03:17:05,910 --> 03:17:09,070
So why did you sign the order all of a sudden?

4281
03:17:10,650 --> 03:17:15,290
Well, I... I was simply performing my duty as Justice Minister.

4282
03:17:15,610 --> 03:17:17,090
That's all there is to it.

4283
03:17:17,530 --> 03:17:22,150
Doubling back about the faulty memories, does anybody else remember a...

4284
03:17:22,150 --> 03:17:25,090
British Lynn, or am I getting Mandela-affected?

4285
03:17:28,050 --> 03:17:29,790
Hmm, that's so mysterious.

4286
03:17:30,290 --> 03:17:32,430
I think you're getting Mandela-affected.

4287
03:17:34,190 --> 03:17:34,970
Right, everybody?

4288
03:17:39,060 --> 03:17:40,100
You're crazy!

4289
03:17:41,360 --> 03:17:42,760
She was never British!

4290
03:17:45,740 --> 03:17:46,260
Uh...

4291
03:17:46,260 --> 03:17:47,660
Okay, let's hit her in the head.

4292
03:17:48,880 --> 03:17:49,400
Wham!

4293
03:17:49,580 --> 03:17:50,040
Oh!

4294
03:17:50,100 --> 03:17:51,420
Oh, wait, that actually worked!

4295
03:17:53,800 --> 03:17:53,940
Ah!

4296
03:17:54,620 --> 03:17:55,880
Cecil, there you are!

4297
03:17:57,560 --> 03:17:59,980
Sounds like the Minister is being very stubborn.

4298
03:18:01,200 --> 03:18:02,060
That's right!

4299
03:18:02,400 --> 03:18:03,180
Hey, yes!

4300
03:18:03,540 --> 03:18:04,240
Oh, sorry.

4301
03:18:04,700 --> 03:18:06,840
Maybe we shouldn't have saved him after all.

4302
03:18:07,260 --> 03:18:07,700
Damn!

4303
03:18:11,760 --> 03:18:12,780
Let him...

4304
03:18:15,690 --> 03:18:20,150
The Minister has to be... or has to have the execution carried out tonight.

4305
03:18:20,450 --> 03:18:22,490
And he has a very good reason for it.

4306
03:18:23,750 --> 03:18:24,950
A good reason?

4307
03:18:26,710 --> 03:18:29,650
I told Lynn about what I learned about the kidnapping.

4308
03:18:32,530 --> 03:18:33,210
Kidnapping?

4309
03:18:35,610 --> 03:18:36,290
Sorry.

4310
03:18:37,210 --> 03:18:39,410
They kidnapped the Justice Minister's daughter?

4311
03:18:40,750 --> 03:18:41,430
Apparently.

4312
03:18:41,850 --> 03:18:43,010
Oh my goodness.

4313
03:18:46,730 --> 03:18:48,030
Mint-napping?

4314
03:18:48,330 --> 03:18:49,570
No, no, no!

4315
03:18:50,530 --> 03:18:51,710
But still...

4316
03:18:53,430 --> 03:18:56,590
That's still no reason to hurry forward with the execution.

4317
03:18:57,670 --> 03:19:00,450
Why don't you go ahead and say that to the Justice Minister then?

4318
03:19:00,730 --> 03:19:00,970
Oh!

4319
03:19:01,870 --> 03:19:05,290
Your daughter's life is not worth more than this man.

4320
03:19:07,050 --> 03:19:08,050
The poor man.

4321
03:19:08,390 --> 03:19:09,790
I hate to do that to him.

4322
03:19:10,590 --> 03:19:11,790
Oh, by the way...

4323
03:19:13,110 --> 03:19:14,550
Do you think you could carry me?

4324
03:19:15,050 --> 03:19:15,450
Hahaha!

4325
03:19:16,910 --> 03:19:17,410
Sure.

4326
03:19:17,590 --> 03:19:19,170
Not very handy, is it not?

4327
03:19:19,170 --> 03:19:20,030
Having no legs.

4328
03:19:21,250 --> 03:19:22,310
Oh my gosh.

4329
03:19:22,450 --> 03:19:26,550
She's got the whole world in a hand.

4330
03:19:26,870 --> 03:19:28,130
She's got the whole...

4331
03:19:28,130 --> 03:19:29,570
Wait, what was...

4332
03:19:30,110 --> 03:19:31,970
What is that black dot on the...

4333
03:19:33,390 --> 03:19:34,490
On the globe?

4334
03:19:36,170 --> 03:19:37,930
Oh, you can't get any closer?

4335
03:19:41,490 --> 03:19:43,830
The sword and globe combo is heavy.

4336
03:19:45,110 --> 03:19:45,890
Mime it.

4337
03:19:46,970 --> 03:19:48,130
Oh, it's the North Pole.

4338
03:19:49,110 --> 03:19:50,170
Thought it was a bug.

4339
03:19:52,310 --> 03:19:53,690
And I'm in here too.

4340
03:19:53,830 --> 03:19:54,470
Don't forget.

4341
03:19:55,150 --> 03:19:58,210
I guess that means a single soul is heavier than the whole world.

4342
03:19:58,910 --> 03:20:01,950
Maybe I'll use this thing to persuade the Minister to change his mind.

4343
03:20:02,470 --> 03:20:03,530
Good luck with that.

4344
03:20:04,550 --> 03:20:04,990
Dang.

4345
03:20:05,730 --> 03:20:06,870
Alright, let's see what he's saying.

4346
03:20:09,250 --> 03:20:11,350
What are you going to do with that globe?

4347
03:20:11,710 --> 03:20:12,950
Crack me in the head with it?

4348
03:20:13,630 --> 03:20:14,250
Oh, this?

4349
03:20:15,150 --> 03:20:16,510
Pay no attention to this.

4350
03:20:17,310 --> 03:20:19,350
Kind of hard not to pay attention to it.

4351
03:20:19,510 --> 03:20:21,510
I know, she looks like she's actually going to attack him.

4352
03:20:22,470 --> 03:20:25,390
By the way, and please pardon me if this is a silly question.

4353
03:20:25,750 --> 03:20:28,190
Were you talking to someone just now?

4354
03:20:29,070 --> 03:20:30,370
But of course not, right?

4355
03:20:30,470 --> 03:20:35,330
I mean, there's no such thing as ghosts, right?

4356
03:20:36,470 --> 03:20:38,190
Are you talking about me?

4357
03:20:39,910 --> 03:20:42,030
Are you talking about me?

4358
03:20:42,730 --> 03:20:43,690
Mint Phantom?

4359
03:20:45,930 --> 03:20:47,670
No, there's no such thing!

4360
03:20:47,870 --> 03:20:48,690
This is a dream.

4361
03:20:48,850 --> 03:20:50,130
It's nothing but a dream!

4362
03:20:50,970 --> 03:20:52,250
Don't you remember me?

4363
03:20:54,990 --> 03:20:57,150
My dream is talking to me!

4364
03:20:58,790 --> 03:21:00,790
So now I'm a dream, eh?

4365
03:21:02,930 --> 03:21:03,830
Oh my gosh.

4366
03:21:04,030 --> 03:21:06,650
I'm starting to want to play Minecraft.

4367
03:21:08,470 --> 03:21:09,350
Mr. Minister?

4368
03:21:10,170 --> 03:21:10,970
We know.

4369
03:21:11,070 --> 03:21:12,390
We know about your daughter.

4370
03:21:12,890 --> 03:21:13,930
She was kidnapped.

4371
03:21:13,930 --> 03:21:14,570
Wasn't she?

4372
03:21:19,030 --> 03:21:23,390
And if the execution doesn't take place tonight, you won't see her again.

4373
03:21:24,210 --> 03:21:24,690
Maybe.

4374
03:21:26,870 --> 03:21:27,350
Yes!

4375
03:21:27,350 --> 03:21:27,670
Oh!

4376
03:21:27,790 --> 03:21:28,630
Oh God!

4377
03:21:28,890 --> 03:21:28,990
Oh!

4378
03:21:29,230 --> 03:21:30,050
Your medicine!

4379
03:21:30,770 --> 03:21:32,330
He took the whole bottle though.

4380
03:21:33,350 --> 03:21:33,970
Uh oh.

4381
03:21:34,370 --> 03:21:36,370
I think we just committed a murder.

4382
03:21:41,360 --> 03:21:42,760
What am I going to do?

4383
03:21:44,640 --> 03:21:46,980
The death row prisoner has escaped.

4384
03:21:47,200 --> 03:21:51,340
If he isn't executed tonight, my daughter, my Amelie...

4385
03:21:52,180 --> 03:21:54,900
But what if that execution isn't the right thing to do?

4386
03:21:57,520 --> 03:21:58,420
Come on, Lin.

4387
03:21:58,560 --> 03:22:00,900
If you keep pressing him like that, he's going to die again.

4388
03:22:01,600 --> 03:22:03,080
What can I do then?

4389
03:22:04,780 --> 03:22:06,240
Oh, everybody's at a loss.

4390
03:22:06,860 --> 03:22:09,400
Time for me to trick time.

4391
03:22:11,600 --> 03:22:13,320
We have to do something about that kidnapping.

4392
03:22:13,660 --> 03:22:16,660
Until we do that, it'll be impossible to get the minister on our side.

4393
03:22:17,020 --> 03:22:18,180
That's the way I see it.

4394
03:22:19,520 --> 03:22:21,220
Gather info on...

4395
03:22:22,280 --> 03:22:22,720
Sorry.

4396
03:22:24,500 --> 03:22:25,580
Let's see what he has to say.

4397
03:22:25,740 --> 03:22:26,920
We meet again, Mr. Minister.

4398
03:22:27,760 --> 03:22:28,200
What?

4399
03:22:28,400 --> 03:22:29,640
I've never seen you before.

4400
03:22:31,040 --> 03:22:33,300
In any case, I'm a very busy man.

4401
03:22:34,160 --> 03:22:36,960
If you're a dream, please don't bother me when I'm awake.

4402
03:22:38,280 --> 03:22:39,480
I'm not a dream.

4403
03:22:41,620 --> 03:22:42,800
She's making me yawn.

4404
03:22:42,920 --> 03:22:43,560
I'm sorry.

4405
03:22:44,320 --> 03:22:46,060
I'm sorry I'm trying to get so sleepy.

4406
03:22:47,960 --> 03:22:51,060
Looks like it's just a waste of time trying to talk to this guy.

4407
03:22:51,700 --> 03:22:52,660
I think you're right.

4408
03:22:52,920 --> 03:22:54,100
Stubborn justice minister.

4409
03:22:54,940 --> 03:22:58,200
Please stop speaking ill of me inside my own head.

4410
03:22:59,100 --> 03:23:00,100
The voices.

4411
03:23:00,460 --> 03:23:02,200
The voices hate me.

4412
03:23:03,040 --> 03:23:03,800
All right.

4413
03:23:04,660 --> 03:23:06,540
Should we go to sexy lady's house?

4414
03:23:16,280 --> 03:23:17,200
Here we go.

4415
03:23:18,700 --> 03:23:21,100
I really should pay the kidnapper's hideout a visit.

4416
03:23:21,240 --> 03:23:25,140
After all, if we want the justice minister to come around, we have to solve this problem first.

4417
03:23:27,180 --> 03:23:30,340
I feel like I'm slowly moving away from my own mystery.

4418
03:23:30,680 --> 03:23:34,860
But I'm not the kind of guy who can abandon a little lady and a little lady in trouble.

4419
03:23:35,200 --> 03:23:37,880
So I guess I'm in this for a little while longer.

4420
03:23:44,530 --> 03:23:45,590
That was it.

4421
03:23:48,270 --> 03:23:50,370
1141 to 1210 AM challenge.

4422
03:23:50,490 --> 03:23:50,890
Save.

4423
03:23:51,450 --> 03:23:52,770
Should I call it here?

4424
03:23:55,030 --> 03:23:57,650
I'm wondering if I should call it here.

4425
03:23:58,030 --> 03:23:58,330
How many?

4426
03:23:58,410 --> 03:23:59,130
We got through what?

4427
03:23:59,190 --> 03:23:59,470
Three?

4428
03:24:00,350 --> 03:24:01,370
Three chapters?

4429
03:24:01,990 --> 03:24:02,730
Hold on.

4430
03:24:02,870 --> 03:24:03,950
Let me see where we're at.

4431
03:24:05,330 --> 03:24:06,550
A little lady.

4432
03:24:13,900 --> 03:24:14,460
Ten.

4433
03:24:14,820 --> 03:24:16,260
Oh, we're on chapter 11.

4434
03:24:16,660 --> 03:24:17,000
What?

4435
03:24:17,020 --> 03:24:18,220
11 out of 18?

4436
03:24:26,230 --> 03:24:27,350
Your call, boss.

4437
03:24:27,350 --> 03:24:30,910
I think maybe the next time we play, I'll endurance it until the end.

4438
03:24:33,150 --> 03:24:33,590
So...

4439
03:24:34,410 --> 03:24:36,910
Doing next chapter would make for a spice at your end.

4440
03:24:37,090 --> 03:24:37,510
Oh.

4441
03:24:38,330 --> 03:24:39,190
Is it...

4442
03:24:39,930 --> 03:24:41,310
Is it long though?

4443
03:24:41,390 --> 03:24:41,990
Is it super long?

4444
03:24:53,220 --> 03:24:54,860
It will be long, yeah.

4445
03:24:55,580 --> 03:24:56,500
Stopping here is okay?

4446
03:25:02,650 --> 03:25:04,510
Yeah, I think maybe I'll just...

4447
03:25:04,970 --> 03:25:05,950
It's a little long.

4448
03:25:05,990 --> 03:25:06,630
It's not really.

4449
03:25:07,910 --> 03:25:08,350
Hmm...

4450
03:25:08,350 --> 03:25:09,170
As long as...

4451
03:25:09,170 --> 03:25:10,970
As long as your puzzle solving skills.

4452
03:25:12,930 --> 03:25:14,150
Thanks, I think.

4453
03:25:14,870 --> 03:25:15,390
Sheesh.

4454
03:25:15,470 --> 03:25:17,210
Why am I getting insulted?

4455
03:25:17,830 --> 03:25:18,610
Like this.

4456
03:25:21,450 --> 03:25:24,690
One of the puzzles coming up stumps a lot of people more than the stealth one.

4457
03:25:24,830 --> 03:25:25,290
Oh, really?

4458
03:25:25,830 --> 03:25:26,350
Okay.

4459
03:25:29,550 --> 03:25:30,070
Hmm...

4460
03:25:31,550 --> 03:25:32,070
Okay.

4461
03:25:32,210 --> 03:25:33,510
Maybe I'll just...

4462
03:25:34,730 --> 03:25:37,290
Since I can't stop the eye...

4463
03:25:39,190 --> 03:25:42,830
I can endurance it next time we play and we can go to the end.

4464
03:25:44,870 --> 03:25:45,350
So...

4465
03:25:45,350 --> 03:25:47,270
Oh gosh, that's a lot of chapters though.

4466
03:25:48,790 --> 03:25:50,770
That's probably gonna be like a 10-hour stream.

4467
03:25:51,310 --> 03:25:52,570
I guess that's an endurance.

4468
03:25:53,110 --> 03:25:53,890
I believe.

4469
03:26:08,720 --> 03:26:10,100
I'mma have to endure too.

4470
03:26:10,800 --> 03:26:12,980
I really thought we would get through more today.

4471
03:26:14,160 --> 03:26:15,520
It is only 10.30.

4472
03:26:16,640 --> 03:26:17,120
Hmm...

4473
03:26:17,120 --> 03:26:17,740
Try...

4474
03:26:18,400 --> 03:26:19,880
Best mom ever.

4475
03:26:21,540 --> 03:26:23,520
Great job cooking on those puzzles.

4476
03:26:23,620 --> 03:26:24,960
Looking forward to seeing how this ends.

4477
03:26:25,140 --> 03:26:26,600
Have fun with Ayami-sensei tomorrow.

4478
03:26:27,060 --> 03:26:27,840
Thank you!

4479
03:26:28,240 --> 03:26:29,000
Thank you, thank you!

4480
03:26:29,780 --> 03:26:31,220
I would book two more streams.

4481
03:26:32,140 --> 03:26:32,620
Yeah...

4482
03:26:32,620 --> 03:26:34,260
Maybe we'll do two streams then.

4483
03:26:42,590 --> 03:26:43,070
Okay.

4484
03:26:43,210 --> 03:26:45,830
So one next week and then one more the week after.

4485
03:26:46,790 --> 03:26:48,030
And then it will be good.

4486
03:26:48,070 --> 03:26:49,610
I'll finish it up before I go to Japan.

4487
03:26:50,930 --> 03:26:51,790
Actually, that works.

4488
03:26:51,890 --> 03:26:53,690
Because I wasn't planning on starting a new channel.

4489
03:26:53,690 --> 03:26:55,490
I'll start a new, longer series until I get back from Japan.

4490
03:26:55,730 --> 03:26:59,410
So once I'm back from Japan, we can start something new.

4491
03:27:00,410 --> 03:27:00,930
Okay.

4492
03:27:01,950 --> 03:27:02,470
Cool.

4493
03:27:04,310 --> 03:27:06,770
Two streams with about four chapters each seems chill.

4494
03:27:06,890 --> 03:27:07,850
I agree, I agree.

4495
03:27:08,110 --> 03:27:09,170
Cool, cool, cool.

4496
03:27:10,110 --> 03:27:11,850
Thanks guys for joining again today!

4497
03:27:12,290 --> 03:27:12,830
Thank you!

4498
03:27:15,170 --> 03:27:18,470
It's a little bit less of a cliffhanger, but...

4499
03:27:19,210 --> 03:27:21,170
There's still so much mystery going on.

4500
03:27:21,170 --> 03:27:23,870
Why couldn't he just say who we were, man?

4501
03:27:24,450 --> 03:27:26,630
Why is he keeping us in such a mystery?

4502
03:27:27,270 --> 03:27:30,210
Also, I want to make sure I'm well rested for Ayami-sensei tomorrow.

4503
03:27:32,230 --> 03:27:33,490
There's a little bit...

4504
03:27:33,970 --> 03:27:35,190
I don't want to say an announcement.

4505
03:27:36,070 --> 03:27:36,590
But...

4506
03:27:37,170 --> 03:27:38,470
Something kind of cool...

4507
03:27:39,090 --> 03:27:40,410
In tomorrow's stream.

4508
03:27:40,810 --> 03:27:41,330
So...

4509
03:27:42,890 --> 03:27:43,930
I think...

4510
03:27:44,530 --> 03:27:45,570
I think...

4511
03:27:45,570 --> 03:27:46,550
It would be fun.

4512
03:27:46,650 --> 03:27:48,130
And if you don't know Ayami-sensei...

4513
03:27:48,130 --> 03:27:49,570
She's so silly and fun.

4514
03:27:49,790 --> 03:27:50,610
I think...

4515
03:27:50,610 --> 03:27:52,490
I think...

4516
03:27:53,430 --> 03:27:54,290
I think...

4517
03:27:54,290 --> 03:27:56,090
It will be a fun stream.

4518
03:27:58,410 --> 03:27:59,230
Yes, yes, yes.

4519
03:27:59,910 --> 03:28:00,550
So...

4520
03:28:01,510 --> 03:28:02,910
Ayami is so cute.

4521
03:28:03,050 --> 03:28:03,590
I know!

4522
03:28:04,150 --> 03:28:06,570
I love Ayami-sensei so much!

4523
03:28:07,230 --> 03:28:07,870
So...

4524
03:28:08,770 --> 03:28:09,410
Yeah!

4525
03:28:11,410 --> 03:28:12,510
The push-push mama!

4526
03:28:12,970 --> 03:28:13,950
Push-push!

4527
03:28:14,010 --> 03:28:14,870
Push-push!

4528
03:28:14,970 --> 03:28:16,510
And Ayami is...

4529
03:28:16,510 --> 03:28:18,430
Ayami, does she speak English?

4530
03:28:18,590 --> 03:28:19,490
She does, actually!

4531
03:28:19,490 --> 03:28:21,150
Ayami speaks such good English.

4532
03:28:21,370 --> 03:28:22,670
I'm going to try and...

4533
03:28:24,010 --> 03:28:26,090
See how much English she'll speak tomorrow.

4534
03:28:27,550 --> 03:28:28,030
But...

4535
03:28:28,030 --> 03:28:32,450
She is coming to the United States for a convention this weekend.

4536
03:28:33,030 --> 03:28:33,450
And...

4537
03:28:33,450 --> 03:28:36,590
So she's going to ask me some questions about the U.S.

4538
03:28:36,790 --> 03:28:40,150
And she also wanted to kind of get to know me a little bit more.

4539
03:28:40,830 --> 03:28:43,290
Since this is our first ever collab together.

4540
03:28:46,350 --> 03:28:46,830
And...

4541
03:28:46,830 --> 03:28:48,010
But she was like so nervous.

4542
03:28:48,110 --> 03:28:49,370
She was so worried about...

4543
03:28:49,370 --> 03:28:50,590
She was like...

4544
03:28:50,590 --> 03:28:53,630
I wonder if anybody is going to come see me at that convention.

4545
03:28:53,790 --> 03:28:55,530
She's going to be at Anime Central this weekend.

4546
03:28:56,090 --> 03:28:56,650
She was like...

4547
03:28:56,650 --> 03:28:58,270
I wonder if anybody is going to come see me.

4548
03:28:58,430 --> 03:29:00,450
And then I checked yesterday for her autographs.

4549
03:29:00,930 --> 03:29:01,270
I was like...

4550
03:29:01,270 --> 03:29:02,070
I wonder how...

4551
03:29:02,070 --> 03:29:02,390
Like...

4552
03:29:02,390 --> 03:29:02,790
You know...

4553
03:29:03,450 --> 03:29:04,630
How her autographs are doing.

4554
03:29:04,730 --> 03:29:05,890
And they were all sold out!

4555
03:29:06,290 --> 03:29:07,650
And I was like...

4556
03:29:07,650 --> 03:29:08,290
Or booked...

4557
03:29:08,290 --> 03:29:09,150
Booked up, I guess.

4558
03:29:09,190 --> 03:29:09,790
I don't think they were...

4559
03:29:09,790 --> 03:29:10,590
I think they were free.

4560
03:29:10,790 --> 03:29:12,250
But they were all like gone.

4561
03:29:12,250 --> 03:29:12,930
And I was like...

4562
03:29:12,930 --> 03:29:14,090
I sent it to her.

4563
03:29:14,150 --> 03:29:14,790
And I was like...

4564
03:29:15,230 --> 03:29:15,930
Ayami-sensei!

4565
03:29:16,290 --> 03:29:17,790
You were so worried for nothing!

4566
03:29:20,350 --> 03:29:20,790
So...

4567
03:29:22,550 --> 03:29:24,930
Everybody be extra nice to Ayami-sensei.

4568
03:29:25,050 --> 03:29:25,490
Yeah!

4569
03:29:27,210 --> 03:29:28,630
They were out within the hour?

4570
03:29:28,830 --> 03:29:29,650
Oh my gosh, really?

4571
03:29:32,910 --> 03:29:35,690
Reminds me of a certain someone who always underestimates herself.

4572
03:29:36,930 --> 03:29:38,130
I wonder who that could be.

4573
03:29:39,870 --> 03:29:41,030
You know a lot of people.

4574
03:29:45,440 --> 03:29:46,000
But yeah.

4575
03:29:46,120 --> 03:29:49,360
So we're going to talk about her coming to the US.

4576
03:29:49,760 --> 03:29:50,200
And...

4577
03:29:50,220 --> 03:29:52,680
What she'll be doing at the convention.

4578
03:29:53,100 --> 03:29:54,320
And some other stuff.

4579
03:29:54,500 --> 03:29:55,700
Talking about me a little bit.

4580
03:29:57,540 --> 03:29:57,940
Well...

4581
03:29:57,940 --> 03:29:59,460
Maybe more than a little bit.

4582
03:29:59,520 --> 03:30:00,680
She was like so interested.

4583
03:30:00,840 --> 03:30:01,220
She was like...

4584
03:30:01,220 --> 03:30:02,640
I want to know everything about Mint.

4585
03:30:02,860 --> 03:30:03,960
And so I was like...

4586
03:30:03,960 --> 03:30:04,760
Okay.

4587
03:30:07,660 --> 03:30:08,180
So yeah.

4588
03:30:10,140 --> 03:30:12,120
She's the only BtoBer at ASEN this year.

4589
03:30:12,680 --> 03:30:13,080
Yeah.

4590
03:30:13,500 --> 03:30:13,900
Yeah.

4591
03:30:13,940 --> 03:30:14,620
Actually, you're right.

4592
03:30:14,760 --> 03:30:15,240
Oh my gosh.

4593
03:30:16,580 --> 03:30:16,980
But...

4594
03:30:18,320 --> 03:30:18,720
Exciting.

4595
03:30:19,660 --> 03:30:20,200
She wants to be a BtoBer.

4596
03:30:20,200 --> 03:30:21,060
She wants your three sizes.

4597
03:30:21,140 --> 03:30:22,560
That's not even a joke.

4598
03:30:24,900 --> 03:30:26,060
That's not even a joke.

4599
03:30:28,700 --> 03:30:29,240
But yeah.

4600
03:30:29,340 --> 03:30:30,240
I'm really, really excited.

4601
03:30:30,660 --> 03:30:31,440
I hope then...

4602
03:30:31,440 --> 03:30:33,840
Next time we collab, maybe it could be like a game or something.

4603
03:30:37,140 --> 03:30:37,580
So...

4604
03:30:38,580 --> 03:30:40,000
I'll see you guys tomorrow then.

4605
03:30:40,120 --> 03:30:40,880
For Ayami.

4606
03:30:41,800 --> 03:30:42,240
And...

4607
03:30:43,140 --> 03:30:46,220
And then Wednesday for English Karaoke.

4608
03:30:47,840 --> 03:30:48,560
I haven't...

4609
03:30:48,560 --> 03:30:50,180
I have no plan set list.

4610
03:30:50,720 --> 03:31:04,120
So if you have any songs that you maybe are like, hey, Mito, I recommend this song, you can always leave it in the comments or you can leave it in the live tag on Twitter.

4611
03:31:05,040 --> 03:31:06,880
So I will look through it.

4612
03:31:06,940 --> 03:31:07,540
I will read it.

4613
03:31:08,020 --> 03:31:09,900
Anna Rock, welcome to membership.

4614
03:31:09,920 --> 03:31:10,560
Thank you.

4615
03:31:11,420 --> 03:31:12,800
Anything weird, Al?

4616
03:31:18,100 --> 03:31:18,580
Okay.

4617
03:31:19,120 --> 03:31:19,600
Okay.

4618
03:31:19,900 --> 03:31:20,160
Okay.

4619
03:31:21,180 --> 03:31:23,480
Goodbye, Virtual YouTuber Maidment.

4620
03:31:23,900 --> 03:31:24,680
Thank you.

4621
03:31:24,740 --> 03:31:25,480
Goodbye, Jordan.

4622
03:31:25,980 --> 03:31:26,940
Halo theme.

4623
03:31:29,040 --> 03:31:30,000
Limp Bizkit.

4624
03:31:30,620 --> 03:31:31,400
Tenacious D.

4625
03:31:32,040 --> 03:31:34,160
Oh, I know one Tenacious D song.

4626
03:31:36,640 --> 03:31:38,460
I don't remember what it's called.

4627
03:31:38,600 --> 03:31:40,260
I think it's the one that like everybody knows.

4628
03:31:41,380 --> 03:31:41,820
Don't...

4629
03:31:41,820 --> 03:31:42,180
But stop.

4630
03:31:42,320 --> 03:31:43,680
Stop recommending stuff now.

4631
03:31:44,020 --> 03:31:44,440
Stop.

4632
03:31:44,480 --> 03:31:45,120
Not yet.

4633
03:31:45,200 --> 03:31:45,540
Not yet.

4634
03:31:45,560 --> 03:31:45,740
Yeah.

4635
03:31:45,780 --> 03:31:46,200
Tribute.

4636
03:31:46,240 --> 03:31:46,520
Tribute.

4637
03:31:47,900 --> 03:31:50,140
Was gifted at membership, but now I'm recruiting.

4638
03:31:50,140 --> 03:31:51,680
Oh my gosh.

4639
03:31:51,780 --> 03:31:52,400
Thank you.

4640
03:31:52,600 --> 03:31:54,120
I really appreciate it.

4641
03:31:54,640 --> 03:31:56,280
I appreciate it so much.

4642
03:31:58,180 --> 03:31:58,800
Oh yeah.

4643
03:31:58,860 --> 03:31:59,080
Stop.

4644
03:31:59,180 --> 03:32:00,280
Don't recommend songs now.

4645
03:32:00,900 --> 03:32:01,700
Recommend them later.

4646
03:32:02,020 --> 03:32:08,380
So recommend them when I have them on paper or on pixels so that I can remember.

4647
03:32:08,620 --> 03:32:09,520
Write them down at least.

4648
03:32:09,860 --> 03:32:11,340
Enjoy your trip to Alcatraz.

4649
03:32:12,480 --> 03:32:18,700
If I can go, but beware the island is the most haunted location in California and possibly the country.

4650
03:32:18,880 --> 03:32:20,120
Sell Block D and particular items.

4651
03:32:20,140 --> 03:32:21,780
The most haunted place on the island.

4652
03:32:21,940 --> 03:32:24,320
The island has eons of bad mojo.

4653
03:32:24,540 --> 03:32:25,100
It's okay.

4654
03:32:25,200 --> 03:32:26,060
I'm a ghost too.

4655
03:32:26,280 --> 03:32:29,600
And if any ghost tries to mess with me, I'll just punch them.

4656
03:32:32,660 --> 03:32:34,400
Which one is cuter for you, Minty?

4657
03:32:34,520 --> 03:32:40,960
Imperial Stormtroopers, Original Trilogy or First Order Stormtroopers, Sequel Trilogy?

4658
03:32:41,240 --> 03:32:42,740
Also, whose armor is cooler?

4659
03:32:44,140 --> 03:32:46,360
Captain Rex or Commander Wolf?

4660
03:32:46,740 --> 03:32:47,140
Okay.

4661
03:32:47,140 --> 03:32:47,380
Hold on.

4662
03:32:47,420 --> 03:32:49,100
I'm going to have to look up all of these real quick.

4663
03:32:49,680 --> 03:32:50,120
Okay.

4664
03:32:52,040 --> 03:32:54,080
This isn't the best Super Chat in the world.

4665
03:32:54,180 --> 03:32:55,300
This is just a tribute.

4666
03:32:57,880 --> 03:32:58,400
Okay.

4667
03:32:58,840 --> 03:32:59,360
Original...

4668
03:33:00,420 --> 03:33:00,940
Wait.

4669
03:33:02,040 --> 03:33:04,700
First Order Stormtrooper?

4670
03:33:08,240 --> 03:33:10,000
First Order Stormtrooper?

4671
03:33:10,800 --> 03:33:13,080
What's the difference between them and the original?

4672
03:33:13,400 --> 03:33:13,960
Oh, wait.

4673
03:33:14,100 --> 03:33:15,560
Oh, I see it.

4674
03:33:18,140 --> 03:33:18,660
Wait.

4675
03:33:18,660 --> 03:33:18,740
Wait.

4676
03:33:18,760 --> 03:33:19,660
They look the same to me.

4677
03:33:20,440 --> 03:33:21,440
Am I dumb?

4678
03:33:26,440 --> 03:33:27,140
Cooler.

4679
03:33:27,160 --> 03:33:33,560
Captain Rex, Captain Rex, Star Wars.

4680
03:33:34,640 --> 03:33:35,960
Oh, I like his.

4681
03:33:36,300 --> 03:33:38,680
Or Commander Wolf.

4682
03:33:44,590 --> 03:33:45,290
Oh.

4683
03:33:48,330 --> 03:33:49,030
Uh...

4684
03:33:49,930 --> 03:33:52,230
I think Captain Rex' is cooler.

4685
03:33:52,610 --> 03:33:53,050
I don't know.

4686
03:33:53,550 --> 03:33:54,250
I don't know.

4687
03:33:56,050 --> 03:33:57,350
Commander Wolf for sure.

4688
03:33:58,410 --> 03:34:01,350
Wait, am I looking at the wrong pictures?

4689
03:34:03,150 --> 03:34:04,270
Commander Wolf.

4690
03:34:04,610 --> 03:34:05,010
Hold on.

4691
03:34:06,310 --> 03:34:07,530
Oh, oh wait.

4692
03:34:07,690 --> 03:34:08,830
Yes, Commander Wolf.

4693
03:34:08,930 --> 03:34:09,310
You're right.

4694
03:34:09,490 --> 03:34:11,030
I was looking at the wrong thing.

4695
03:34:11,350 --> 03:34:13,310
Yeah, Commander Wolf looks cooler.

4696
03:34:13,910 --> 03:34:14,670
I think.

4697
03:34:16,670 --> 03:34:17,670
Oh, sorry.

4698
03:34:17,850 --> 03:34:18,730
Everyone said base.

4699
03:34:22,510 --> 03:34:23,470
I don't know.

4700
03:34:23,670 --> 03:34:24,670
Rex is the best.

4701
03:34:24,870 --> 03:34:25,870
And they both look really nice.

4702
03:34:25,930 --> 03:34:26,430
I like the blue.

4703
03:34:31,760 --> 03:34:33,660
How could my Oshii betray me?

4704
03:34:37,080 --> 03:34:37,820
Okay, guys.

4705
03:34:37,980 --> 03:34:38,660
I'm gonna go.

4706
03:34:38,780 --> 03:34:40,060
I'm gonna go sleep now.

4707
03:34:40,380 --> 03:34:42,980
Thank you guys again for watching and hanging out with me today.

4708
03:34:43,580 --> 03:34:46,200
And we'll finish this up in two more streams.

4709
03:34:46,340 --> 03:34:46,820
Oh my gosh.

4710
03:34:46,840 --> 03:34:49,200
Do you guys want to see the coolest thing that I've seen today at all?

4711
03:34:50,780 --> 03:34:53,580
I'm still trying to decide if I should pre-order this.

4712
03:34:53,720 --> 03:34:54,280
It's so awesome.

4713
03:34:54,660 --> 03:34:55,720
Thanks for the fun stream.

4714
03:34:55,840 --> 03:34:56,820
Can't wait for the next part.

4715
03:34:57,180 --> 03:34:57,800
Thank you!

4716
03:34:58,820 --> 03:34:59,220
Wait.

4717
03:34:59,640 --> 03:35:00,900
Oh, I can't show you.

4718
03:35:01,580 --> 03:35:01,980
Wait.

4719
03:35:02,000 --> 03:35:02,320
Oh no.

4720
03:35:02,380 --> 03:35:03,240
It's on the other screen.

4721
03:35:04,120 --> 03:35:04,900
And it's hidden.

4722
03:35:05,460 --> 03:35:08,600
I'm currently on my... I'm on my other...

4723
03:35:09,080 --> 03:35:10,180
It's on my other monitor.

4724
03:35:10,260 --> 03:35:11,000
I can't get to it.

4725
03:35:11,140 --> 03:35:11,880
Okay, never mind.

4726
03:35:12,080 --> 03:35:12,420
Okay.

4727
03:35:12,540 --> 03:35:13,320
I'm gonna go now.

4728
03:35:15,440 --> 03:35:15,840
Otsuminto!

4729
03:35:15,840 --> 03:35:15,960
Otsuminto!

4730
03:35:19,160 --> 03:35:20,860
It wasn't a Metal Gear thing.

4731
03:35:22,680 --> 03:35:23,860
Just tell us what it is.

4732
03:35:23,940 --> 03:35:24,100
Okay.

4733
03:35:24,140 --> 03:35:25,740
I saw it on AmiAmi earlier.

4734
03:35:26,200 --> 03:35:27,020
It's a...

4735
03:35:27,640 --> 03:35:31,900
It's a... It's a Rubik's Cube.

4736
03:35:32,260 --> 03:35:35,540
But it transforms into a mech.

4737
03:35:37,420 --> 03:35:40,560
But it's a real Rubik's... Well, I don't know if it's a real Rubik's Cube.

4738
03:35:42,480 --> 03:35:44,400
But it can turn into a Rubik's Cube.

4739
03:35:45,260 --> 03:35:47,600
Like the cube version.

4740
03:35:47,820 --> 03:35:49,740
And then you can also turn it into a mech.

4741
03:35:50,280 --> 03:35:51,580
It's so awesome!

4742
03:35:52,860 --> 03:35:53,880
I want it.

4743
03:35:54,020 --> 03:35:55,020
What's the name?

4744
03:35:57,660 --> 03:35:59,080
Chogokin Rubik's Cube.

4745
03:36:01,400 --> 03:36:02,760
Chogokin Rubik's Cube.

4746
03:36:04,180 --> 03:36:05,480
It's so cool!

4747
03:36:06,820 --> 03:36:08,120
I was looking at it.

4748
03:36:16,580 --> 03:36:17,200
Alright.

4749
03:36:18,220 --> 03:36:20,380
I think... I was... Yeah.

4750
03:36:23,860 --> 03:36:24,480
Anyway.

4751
03:36:24,480 --> 03:36:25,100
Ignoring...

4752
03:36:26,140 --> 03:36:27,460
Ignoring what I just saw.

4753
03:36:30,580 --> 03:36:32,160
What was I saying?

4754
03:36:33,420 --> 03:36:37,340
I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't support you buying a transforming toy.

4755
03:36:38,620 --> 03:36:40,520
Nah, I was considering it.

4756
03:36:40,640 --> 03:36:41,200
I was just...

4757
03:36:41,200 --> 03:36:42,420
But I thought it was so cool.

4758
03:36:42,600 --> 03:36:44,060
But I don't know if I'll get it yet.

4759
03:36:44,760 --> 03:36:47,920
It's kind of expensive, so I was like...

4760
03:36:48,620 --> 03:36:52,560
And I already have some other figures I have to wait for.

4761
03:36:54,700 --> 03:36:56,100
So... You know...

4762
03:36:58,500 --> 03:36:58,980
Anyway.

4763
03:36:59,160 --> 03:36:59,900
Okay, thank you.

4764
03:37:00,140 --> 03:37:00,940
Thank you, everyone.

4765
03:37:01,340 --> 03:37:04,800
Thank you for hanging out.

4766
03:37:04,920 --> 03:37:06,180
See you guys tomorrow.

4767
03:37:07,020 --> 03:37:07,700
Bye bye.

4768
03:37:07,860 --> 03:37:08,600
Have a good night.

4769
03:37:08,600 --> 03:37:08,640
Bye!

4770
03:37:08,640 --> 03:37:09,240
Have a good night!

4771
03:37:09,480 --> 03:37:10,420
Get lots of rest.

4772
03:37:10,740 --> 03:37:11,580
Get lots of rest.

4773
03:37:11,840 --> 03:37:12,780
Drink some water.

4774
03:37:12,880 --> 03:37:13,440
Stay hydrated.

4775
03:37:14,840 --> 03:37:15,320
Itterashai!

4776
03:37:15,320 --> 03:37:16,120
Bye-bye!

4777
03:37:16,220 --> 03:37:16,800
Bye-bye!

4778
03:37:44,130 --> 03:37:45,370
It's so cool!

4779
03:37:47,330 --> 03:37:48,270
Look at him!

4780
03:37:52,600 --> 03:37:53,800
He's just a guy.

4781
03:37:54,280 --> 03:37:55,340
He's just so...

4782
03:37:57,780 --> 03:38:00,000
But he transformed into a Rubik's Cube!

4783
03:38:00,460 --> 03:38:04,600
I think if I knew how to solve a Rubik's Cube, I would definitely get it.

4784
03:38:05,340 --> 03:38:08,180
If I was like a huge Rubik's Cube fan.

4785
03:38:08,540 --> 03:38:12,640
But just the whole thing is such a fun concept, right?

4786
03:38:15,000 --> 03:38:17,280
Mecha Rubik's Ultimate Form!

4787
03:38:18,220 --> 03:38:19,400
It's just a guy!

4788
03:38:19,740 --> 03:38:20,060
Yeah!

4789
03:38:20,060 --> 03:38:20,980
