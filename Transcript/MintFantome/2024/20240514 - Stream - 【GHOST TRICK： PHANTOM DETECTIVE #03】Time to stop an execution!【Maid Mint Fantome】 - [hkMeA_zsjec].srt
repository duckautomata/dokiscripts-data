1
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,120
Why does it seem so quiet?

2
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,720
I don't know why the music seems so different than before.

3
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,720
Hello everybody, I'm Mint, welcome.

4
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,900

Good morning!

12
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,300
Hello, hello.

13
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,760
Why is it so low?

14
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,520
If I turn it up, I don't remember it being that high.

15
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,240
I don't know.

16
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,220
I have no idea.

17
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,160
I didn't adjust the music.

18
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,100
Weird.

19
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,000
Thank you, thank you.

20
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,480

Oh, they're real.

23
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,960
Sharing my birthday cash.

24
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,260
Please don't sing for me, though.

25
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,380
It'll embarrass me.

26
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,820
I wouldn't embarrass you, Slice Saber.

27
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,360
Don't worry.

28
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,380
Happy birthday to you.

29
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,720

Slice Saber!

33
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,270

34
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,730
more time!

35
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,370
How old are you now?

36
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,870
Slice Saber, how old are you now?

37
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,210
How old are you now?

38
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,680
How old are you now?

39
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:12,660
Woo!

40
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,380
You're not embarrassed, right?

41
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,920
Oh, yeah!

42
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,760
One more time!

43
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,120
You're almost a ghost.

44
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,560
You're almost a ghost.

45
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,820
You're almost like Minto.

46
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,320
You're almost a ghost.

47
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,040
Yeah!

48
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:55,200
Um, die without regrets, or you'll be a ghost.

49
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:05,500
Die without regrets, or you'll be a ghost.

50
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,240
Asking for the three digits.

51
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,540
Oh, what's your credit card number?

52
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:35,360

plus the three digits on the back and don't forget the zip

53
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,860

56
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:26,920
I think we're good I think we've thoroughly clearly
embarrassed Slice Saber for their birthday.

57
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,620
Don't ever say, don't sing to me, it's embarrassing.

58
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,260
The AI told me it was your birthday that you turned 37.

59
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:48,560
Wait, the AI is just like, it's Slice Saber's birthday and
everyone's singing to it.

60
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
turning 37.

61
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
No way.

62
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,220
Oh my gosh.

63
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,000
Paying you to stop.

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,280
Happy birthday.

65
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,460

74
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:27,260

checked my bank account and I was negative and I was like

75

But honestly, I say a bajillion.

81
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,680
But like, he couldn't even order that many pizzas because I
did not have that much in my bank account.

82
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,940
Why are you stealing from some poor ghost like me?

83
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:19,640
Huh?

84
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640

87
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,620
Stolen money is the best money.

88
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,760
I don't know about that.

89
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,780
Pizza party fun.

90
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,580
Yippee!

91
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,800
Spent all my money on seven pizzas.

92
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,640
Mine got stolen once and they spent 700 bucks on an office
depot.

93
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:45,980
Why?

94
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,060
What are they buying?

95
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,860
maybe maybe they thought that you were like loaning them
money for the start their business you know what i mean it

96
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:07,920
was a small loan right okay okay okay okay no more talking
about stolen credit cards no more credit card business talk

97
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:17,900
okay we're gonna talk about ghost and tricks that's had my
card denied while shopping out of town because of suspicious

98
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,880
purchases in California to buy guns.

99
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,160
It's about that was approved.

100
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,480
Oh my gosh, wait!

101
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,360
That was, that has happened to me because when my card was
stolen, it was a different state.

102
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,580
But I have gone to other places before and had my card
declined because I thought it was suspicious.

103
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,200
So weird.

104
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,440
But meant the story time.

105
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:55,060
Um, um, we left off on a clip hanger last time we played
where, um, we the guy that Lynn was been trying to get in

106
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:06,060

station of people with special crimes and that's the guy

107
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:16,720
that Lynn is wanting to help is getting executed tonight in
like an hour or something so we have to like whoops we have

108
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,860
to kind of skedaddle hopefully the Audio will be okay.

109
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,860
If not, if it's too quiet, during, I can adjust it as well.

110
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,780
So just let me know.

111
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,220

117
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,660
Cost Co.

118
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,820

really appreciate it can't believe it's been a month oh my

123
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:19,790
gosh well not a month since I've been back I guess a little
over a month that I've since I've been back yeah I kind of

124
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:28,430
wanted to do something a little bit decided to do the
english karaoke on wednesday so um it's not it's not much

125
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:38,970
but um i have been cooking i have been cooking a lot of
stuff oh my gosh like um well actually most of everything

126
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:49,390
that i've been cooking has been for um my anniversary which
will be in july which i'm like oh my god can i is it okay if

127
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:56,170
i say that it's my four year anniversary Because technically
I didn't even get to celebrate my first year anniversary.

128
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:05,970
But it would be kind of cool to say that it's a four year
anniversary because four is a spooky number.

129
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,550
Technically we never even got to celebrate one anniversary.

130
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,970
So we will celebrate.

131
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,450
And I have some fun things that I'm planning for...

132
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,790
Anniversary.

133
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:28,150
I was like, oh my gosh, I gotta start working on stuff now,
honestly.

134
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,070
I was like, change.

135
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,650
One in four.

136
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,190
I was kind of like thinking of doing like that.

137
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:44,850
But I was like, if I do like one zero, or not zero, one like
one slash four or one in four, people might get confused.

138
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:45,710
I don't know.

139
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,310
Hey, I'm Minto.

Work was pretty crazy, but I'm getting hyped for this gym
session with my Kamiyoshi.

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,750

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:31,570
talking to like six different artists at once so i'm like
wow and then i'm also ordering the postcards and i'm also

172
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:38,990
like oh and i'm also uh i'm having a busy weekend this
weekend which is why i'm having to take off a couple days

173
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:47,270
and so i'm just like i gotta get ready for that i gotta get
to do this and i gotta record the podcast and i gotta email

174
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:54,630
this person back and like people are emailing me for like
events and conventions and stuff.

175
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,950
So I'm just like, okay.

176
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,570
Or like other things that seem kind of cool.

177
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,550
So I'm just like, I gotta email this person back.

178
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:12,030
So there's like been so much going on behind the scenes that
I like wish I could share more of, but I have been trying to

179
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,490
work hard to do lots of stuff.

180
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,810
It's a lot to deal with.

181
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,170
Yeah, but it's so much fun.

182
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,830
It's actually so much fun.

183
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,750
Um...

184
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,830
I think if I...

185
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,170
Well actually not that I think.

186
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:34,390
The day, whenever I decide to not be a streamer anymore, one
thing that I really love is just like general planning.

187
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,150
And like, I would love to like...

188
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,110
Um...

189
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,530
I don't know.

190
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:46,050
Like maybe one day be like a manager to like a VTuber or
something.

191
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,710
Project manager mint.

192
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,430
Yeah!

193
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,690
It's fun.

194
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,050
I used to plan a bunch of stuff.

195
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,490
Even before V-Tubing.

196
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,810
And even as a V-Tuber, I love planning stuff.

197
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,350
So, but trying to plan things.

198
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,550
Yeah.

199
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,810
Starting your own V-Tuber company with Kacha and Idols.

200
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,130
How many directions did you plan things in?

201
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:26,910
What do you mean?

202
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,230
hey, I helped with planning some stuff at, like,
conventions.

203
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,800
It's probably the easiest way to say it.

204
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:41,830
So.

205
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,250
I got that reference.

206
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,030
Happy one month, Miss Fartome.

207
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,030
Thank you.

208
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,830
Poppy!

209
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,490
Thanks for the pink!

210
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:02,490
I couldn't make it for the last two streams, but I'm so glad
I can finally watch my favorite streamer my favorite VTuber

211
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,770
stream my favorite game live!

212
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,870
Hope you enjoy the ride, man!

213
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,590
Thank you!

214
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,570
Thanks for the pink!

215
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,790
There's a much cooler ambition than working in a grocery
store.

216
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,730
Look, I didn't know.

217
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,030
I didn't know!

218
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:16,870
Bye.

219
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,310
Um.

220
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,310
What was I gonna say?

221
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:24,870
Oh!

222
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,430
Oh my gosh, you guys.

223
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:33,210
Yesterday, I saw my grandma and my mom for Mother's Day.

224
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,950
And, um, I'm sorry, we'll get to the game eventually.

225
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:37,750
Holy cow.

226
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:44,810
But, uh, I gifted my mom, um, uh, this thing.

227
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,470
Let me see if I can get it.

228
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,550
Let me see if I can get a picture.

229
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,330
Or, uh, say what it is.

230
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:50,990
Hold on.

231
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,650
Uh, uh.

232
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:07,520
okay oh i have to do this too oh my gosh okay um so my mom
is really into like meditating and relaxing and stuff like

233
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:15,100
that and i found this thing and i got it on sale thank god
because it was really expensive but it's called this it's

234
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:25,300
called the drift and it's like it's like it's like a you
know those those zen gardens where you the sand.

235
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:35,600
It's like one of those, but it's, but it's, it's a, it, you
put a metal ball on it and it, Kansai Dorifto.

236
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,160
Yeah.

237
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,820
And like, and then you, you, you put, you get an app and you
beep, beep, beep.

238
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,540
And then it draws a design on the sand for you.

239
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:58,260
And it's like, oh my gosh, at one point we were all just
standing there in silence like staring at it and just like

240
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:13,100
inside we were all like watching it draw in the sand and i
had to leave before my um before my grandma because my

241
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:19,120
grandma went to sleep i had to leave before she got to see
it but then my mom texted me a picture of my grandma and she

242
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,700
was just let me see what she said She sent me a picture of
my grandma just staring at it.

243
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,620
She said, thank you so much for the gift you bought me.

244
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,740
Grandma and I are sitting here in the quiet, just mesmerized
by it.

245
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,340
I was like, it's a picture of my grandma just staring at
this thing.

246
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,860
Like, so, like, locked on.

247
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,140
It's so funny, too, because my grandma likes to wear
headbands.

248
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,860
She always has as, even when I was like a young ghost.

249
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,000
And, and, and the headband she was wearing this time was,
was, was black headband.

250
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,180
And I was like, like around her head.

251
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,540
And I was like, Grandma, you got infinite ammo.

252
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:19,580
And she, oh, but she wouldn't stop talking about, she
wouldn't stop talking.

253
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,140
She would be like, she would be like, my grandma's at an old
person home, right?

254
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,600
But she loves, usually I feel like old people don't like the
old people's home.

255
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,440
But my grandma is obsessed with this old person's home.

256
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,340
She loves the old people home.

257
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,580
She's like, she's like, don't ever take me out.

258
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,740
And we're like, we're not.

259
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,760
My mom's just like, yep.

260
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,220
Because my grandma will be like, she's like, I go up and
down those halls.

261
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,040
And I keep everybody in check.

262
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:02,720
I, you know, recently fights have been getting, have been
breaking out with the, with the, with the old people and

263
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,560
with the doctors.

264
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:10,680
And she, she just like always calls it one flu's, flu over
the cuckoo's nest every time I see her.

265
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,380
She's like, have you seen one flu over the cuckoo's nest?

266
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,800
That's this place.

267
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,580
And I'm in charge.

268
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,680
And I'm like, yeah, I know, grandma.

269
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,260
Elderly uprising.

270
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,440
Well, she was just like, there was a fight that broke out.

271
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:34,240
there was a fight that broke out and I went in there I went
in there and I said hey you fuckers cut it out because I

272
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,200
need that doctor because I have to shit my grandma

273
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:56,130
what do you mean why do you mean by that grandma mint is
living the dream it's true my grandma man

274
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,690
my grandma she said she

275
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:17,090
oh my grandma I'm trying to think of what else she's she
kept talking she like the whole time I was taking I was

276
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:22,910
driving with her she wouldn't stop talking about her
explosive diarrhea I don't think I should share that with

277
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,130
you guys so much

278
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,630
Is your grandma a big boss or something?

279
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,590
My grandma doesn't hold back about anything.

280
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,290
Yeah, let's not share it.

281
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,530
Is your grandma Johnny?

282
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,810
Oh, grandma.

283
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,290
Ugh.

284
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:53,350
Okay.

285
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,650
That's how we play the game.

286
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:54,910
Sorry.

287
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,350
I just thought of that because I was just like...

288
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,850
I kind of want to get the thing now for me too.

289
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:07,090
So I can sit in the dark or sit in silence just mesmerized
by this little ball drawing in the sand.

290
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,830
It's really mesmerizing though.

291
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,730
But they're really expensive.

292
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:20,510
I bought it because it was a combined like Mother's Gate,
Mother's Day, birthday, did I say Mother's Gate?

293
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,760
Your mom's what?

294
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,960
That was a mother's day birthday gift.

295
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,740
Okay, I'm going to continue the game.

296
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,200
We're playing the game now.

297
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,580
Oh my goodness.

298
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,380
Okay, we have five minutes until a person is dead, you guys.

299
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,780
We can't be laughing.

300
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,680
We can't be...

301
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,000
Search game.

302
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,660
What is wrong with me?

303
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,960
First search gay and now mother's gay.

304
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,240
You really can't talk your way.

305
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:30,700
Okay, no, I can talk my way out of it because I combine day
with gift, okay?

306
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,020
This is actually how my brain works.

307
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:40,400
Everything just is like, you take all the words of a
sentence and you go, you go, you take all the words and then

308
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,020
you go, and you smash it all together, okay?

309
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,380
Mother's gay?

310
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,560
Yeah, they are, both of them, how do you know?

311
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:12,280
I don't, I, the other day, the other day I was, this is,
what did I type, hold on, I was messaging someone, and, and

312
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:20,700
I was messaging someone, and they were like, Do you have a
deadline when you went to this finish?

313
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,240
And I was like, no, whenever you have fun.

314
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,300
Because in my brain, I typed have.

315
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,020
And so my brain just said, have fun.

316
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,580
But I meant have time.

317
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,840
And I was like, no, not fun time.

318
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,000
Don't have fun.

319
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,620
My brain is so weird.

320
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,600
Enjoy your meal, you too.

321
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,340
It's just because, like, I'll finish something.

322
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,240
I'm so afraid to type on stream because of it.

323
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,780
Because I know, like, ouch.

324
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,780
Sorry, my eye is bothering me.

325
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:12,320
I know that if I type, if there's a certain phrase that I'm
typing, my brain will, it, like, auto-finishes.

326
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,800
And it's just, it's just, it's so stupid.

327
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,720
because I type things and I'm like, why did I type that?

328
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,600
I don't mean have fun at all.

329
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,930
Don't have fun.

330
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,530
Not very nice there, Min.

331
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,470
30 minutes and we've made it to the file select.

332
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,310
We're cruising tonight, guys.

333
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,930
No, we're starting.

334
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,650
We're starting right now.

335
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,090
Okay, everybody comfy.

336
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,610
Let's start the game.

337
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,970
But please, I can't breathe.

338
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,370
Stop being hilarious for like one second.

339
00:29:50,830 --> 00:30:00,950
her brain is too far in the future I swear I'm I'm always
clowning I'm always clowning alright alright someone's dying

340
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:06,190
you guys 1055 p.m.

341
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:18,130
I went to try and rescue prisoner D-99 even under ordinary
circumstances that prison has a strange atmosphere but this

342
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:32,690
time there's something even stranger about it hey I happened
to enjoy the ghost yapping thank you I'm calm I'm normal I'm

343
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:41,310
normal an execution with my memory gone I don't have a clear
image of what that is in my head but even I can sense the

344
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:51,410
strong feeling of foreboding that hangs in the air you don't
know what an execution is maybe I'm too late no

345
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:13,420
oh no he's he's grooving is it really quiet i'm really hold
on i even turned up the sound okay well i'll turn it to nine

346
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:23,800
the sound is fine it's pretty quiet on my it sounds quiet
even to me hmm i'll turn it up just a little bit okay so

347
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:33,500
how's it going with the generator in the basement why is oh
they're trying to fix it now it's gonna take a while they

348
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:43,000
said they haven't even gotten the internal phone there back
up yet waiting for the inevitable mint apologizes after

349
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:53,780
being three hours late to her stream to explain that she was
watching circles in sand stream hey now i just hope the

350
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,960
Routies, don't rush the guard room.

351
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,400
Oh, we don't have any Routies here.

352
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:05,200
And what's more, the one who committed the most atrocious
crime isn't even here anymore at all.

353
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,000
Wait, what?

354
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,740
You promised not to talk about that.

355
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:18,410
Look, would you not get off with that weird flipping and
flopping around?

356
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,990
I can't stand looking at it.

357
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:25,410
If you don't stop, I just might have to pound you.

358
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,480
Where's the fanfic of these two?

359
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:49,400
This is a glorious dance That's been passed down in my
family for generations When you don't know what else to do

360
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,800
Dance, dance, dance We call it the panic dance

361
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:11,580
This is special detention calling from the death chamber the
internal phone is finally back up oh it's pitch black down

362
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:19,180
here though until they get the generator going again how's
it going up there the phone's been ringing off the hook from

363
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:29,460
headquarters the death chamber oh boy we can't let the
existence of this prison become known to the outside world

364
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,660
we'll have to round up the prisoners somehow Is Bailey
dancing?

365
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,480
Yep, you should see him.

366
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,260
Whoa, thank you for the 20 gifts!

367
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,320
Wait, who's gifted?

368
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,400
Kido!

369
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,640
Thank you!

370
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,820
Thank you so much.

371
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,820
Take a video of it.

372
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,760
We can all watch it together when we're done.

373
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,240
Once the generator is back up, I'll record it with the
security camera.

374
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,460
This is so messed up.

375
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:08,060
Someone is about to die and you're like, dancing and then
we'll watch it after the guy is dead.

376
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,520
Oh my god.

377
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,280
I'm going.

378
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,780
Generators still not up?

379
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,260
I can't keep this up much longer.

380
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,340
Believe me.

381
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,960
Nobody is asking you to.

382
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,280
Why don't you just stop?

383
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,060
Oh wait, this is the guy that has the accent, right?

384
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,900
He has a southern accent.

385
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,060
Will you dance instead then?

386
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,120
Me?

387
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,520
You kidding me?

388
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,560
Somebody has to do it!

389
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,400
Oh, he's going faster.

390
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:42,860
Oh my god.

391
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,340
If that somebody is me, I'll keep dancing until I drop!

392
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,560
Oh my god, he's going even faster!

393
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,220
Despite how it looks, the situation seems pretty serious.

394
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,160
Bailey's dance is certainly intriguing.

395
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,380
Thank you for being awesome and as cool as heck.

396
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,040
Thank you, Kiori!

397
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,960
Thank you for one month.

398
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,520
But that telephone call that came in is even more
interesting.

399
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,740
The man said he was calling from the death chamber, eh?

400
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,720
Now that I have the extension number, I should go check it
out.

401
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,880
Oh, it's a trick.

402
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,200
Internal.

403
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,560
Special detention.

404
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,500
Was it that one?

405
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,180
I assume the death chamber is...

406
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,340
Oh.

407
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,160
Whoa!

408
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,640
It's so dark.

409
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,960
This is not good.

410
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,560
Not good at all.

411
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,600
Fortnite emote the panic away.

412
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,480
Yeah, I feel like a ghost is going to show up any minute
now.

413
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,780
Now, wouldn't that be silly?

414
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,430
Ghost?

415
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,820
Hey, come on.

416
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,860
Show some respect.

417
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,760
There's a dead man here.

418
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,460
Wait, what?

419
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,080
That's right.

420
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:23,520
Me.

421
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,320
Wait, hold on.

422
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,780
That's right.

423
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,120
That's right.

424
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:32,820
Me.

425
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,580
Me too.

426
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,320
Hey, Sissel, I was dead before you, okay?

427
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,820
This is my sh-dick.

428
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,080
But, woo, I never saw that one coming, did you?

429
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,400
Wait, so did they, like, electrocute him and it was so
powerful?

430
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,300
It took out the power.

431
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,640
Who could have?

432
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,080
Anyway, the generator is going to be fixed soon, so I guess
we hang tight.

433
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,320
Okay.

434
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,880
There's a dead man.

435
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,260
Who?

436
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,040
I guess darkness doesn't really exist in the ghost world.

437
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,820
Even without light, I can still see what's going on.

438
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,040
I can use the ghost world to help me find that generator.

439
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,800
A whole month already.

440
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,340
Thank you!

441
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:22,960
Love you.

442
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,200
Power supply?

443
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,160
Emergency light?

444
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,020
Water drop?

445
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,100
Oh, that will probably help me get down.

446
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,440
Wait, is that the dead man up there?

447
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:37,940
Uh oh.

448
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,220
Uh oh.

449
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,180
Oh no, it's a spoon.

450
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,040
Wait!

451
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,780
Wait, this is the guy he's been crawling out this whole
time!

452
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,530
Oh my god.

453
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,810
Wait, where'd the water drop Tropical.

454
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,850
This must be it, right?

455
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,130
Oh, geez.

456
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,630
Where'd that wrench go?

457
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:12,630
Without it, I can't tighten the last bolt on the generator.

458
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,270
I sure wish I could see in the dark like a cat.

459
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,190
Or like a ghost.

460
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,030
This appears to be some kind of control panel.

461
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,550
I might be able to operate it.

462
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,470
But it doesn't seem to be responding.

463
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,010
It's too dark to really tell, though.

464
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,850
I guess the first thing I need to do is to restore that
generator.

465
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,370
So the wrench.

466
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:36,650
Hello.

467
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,040
I can't hold on much longer.

468
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:50,800
Lion from the game just dug up a child memory of the
cliffhanger guy from between the lines.

469
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,220
Okay.

470
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:57,980
Huh?

471
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,330
Huh?

472
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:06,610
Okay!

473
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,740
Cliffhanger.

474
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,480
Cliffhanger guy.

475
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,840
I don't know.

476
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,000
I don't know that one.

477
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,360
Actually, I don't think so.

478
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,060
It says between the lions.

479
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,480
That's between the lions.

480
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,540
That's why he's called cliffhanger.

481
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,800
The real ones in chat give me...

482
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,720
I've seen these things before.

483
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,900
Some kind of tool for turning things.

484
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,620
It's leaning up against the wall.

485
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,520
If I knock it over, I wonder if he'll notice.

486
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,920
Darn, it's too heavy.

487
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,160
It won't budge.

488
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:58,900
Oh, man.

489
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,700
Let's see.

490
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,600
Was this...

491
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,260
It's a lie.

492
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,120
Maybe, um...

493
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,940
Oh, I can barely!

494
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,020
Dang.

495
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,520
Okay.

496
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,100
Let's wait for the droplet to form again.

497
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,160
Oh, okay.

498
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,340
Now if I go and drop.

499
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,620
Now I'm in the bucket.

500
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,940
Oh, I can't do anything in the bucket.

501
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,380
Toolbox.

502
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,480
Let's open it up.

503
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:33,760
Oh!

504
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,080
Oh, he saw it.

505
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,740
Oh, hey, there it is.

506
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,280
These guys remind me so much of like the...

507
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,280
The, what's it called?

508
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,880
The Genome Soldiers.

509
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,740
There, done.

510
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,120
Did it?

511
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,630
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

512
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:56,930
Yippee!

513
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,950
Wait, is this a good thing that we...

514
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,110
Oh.

515
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:00,710
Is it a...

516
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,330
Oh, oh, oh.

517
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:03,150
Oh!

518
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:03,830
What?

519
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:09,910
Wait, so if the generator is off and all the cells just
open?

520
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,910
I don't think that seems very...

521
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:14,830
Um...

522
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,130
Now the lights are back on.

523
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,310
But what happened here?

524
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,170
The answer is still shrouded in darkness.

525
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,510
I better see if I can pick up on some more information.

526
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,810
Can't seem to shake this bad feeling I've got.

527
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:27,730
Me too, though.

528
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,710
And then we'll go to here.

529
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,590
This one.

530
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:37,690
Wait.

531
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,610
Oh my gosh, the timing has to be...

532
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,510
Pitch perfect!

533
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:42,850
Okay.

534
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,710
There we go.

535
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:47,750
There we go.

536
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,210
Okay.

537
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,410
What if I lower this?

538
00:41:52,430 --> 00:42:04,090
lover didn't do anything did someone say the door to
darkness hey do you think this execution was really the

539
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:14,590
right thing to do what the heck are you saying I mean I know
this country has the death penalty but how many years has it

540
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:24,530
been since we used this chair what do you mean was oh yeah I
don't know it had quite a dirt on it i bet that's what

541
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:35,190
happened all that debris damaged the wiring well i think it
was divine retribution don't be stupid the prisoner wanted

542
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,490
to be executed you know

543
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:50,920
he's dead inspector jowl i guess i was too late so when are
they gonna pick up his body They'll be sending over a car

544
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,000
from the public cemetery pretty soon.

545
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,000
After we hand over the body and clean up the mortuary, we're
done!

546
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,080
Yeah, okay.

547
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:02,880
Yeah, okay.

548
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,800
Are we the bodies?

549
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,740
No!

550
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,600
No, no.

551
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,340
What else are they saying?

552
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,840
This chair scares me.

553
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,380
I don't want to repair it or get anywhere near it.

554
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,740
Why is there so much water?

555
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,000
Who knows when it's gonna blow up?

556
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,180
I knew it blew up.

557
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,900
Or let loose with the juice.

558
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,720
Just mint is the baddie, I think.

559
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,940
No, no, no.

560
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,380
Weirdest mortuary assistant DLC.

561
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,540
I'm not gonna lie, when they said mortuary, I also thought
of mortuary assistant.

562
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,580
And then I remembered that is the scariest game I've ever
played in my entire afterlife.

563
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,020
It's so scary!

564
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,520
Oh my gosh.

565
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,360
Loose with the juice.

566
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:47,940
Yikes.

567
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:48,840
Shut up, man.

568
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,840
Accidents can happen with anything after all.

569
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,500
But let's just get this thing fixed.

570
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,000
Come on.

571
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,260
If I'm executed by an accident, I'm gonna come back and
haunt you.

572
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,960
I can make that happen.

573
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,260
Haunt me?

574
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,520
Why me?

575
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,380
Sounds like a pretty dangerous chair.

576
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,700
Hmm, the chair that gives shocks.

577
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,000
Can I use that somehow?

578
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,800
Oh, are you gonna kill them?

579
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,320
Oh my gosh, this little...

580
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,300
Kind of insane.

581
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,760
Wait, how do I get over there?

582
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:20,880
Uh.

583
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,700
Oh, the drips.

584
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,460
Oh.

585
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,340
Oh.

586
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,460
Wait, I can't reach.

587
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,060
Let's see what he says.

588
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,560
So Detective Jowd has already been executed.

589
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,820
Looks like there was a reason for that bad feeling I was
getting.

590
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:41,780
But that's okay.

591
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,660
This isn't a big problem for me.

592
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,340
But if the body is taken from the mortuary, that'll be bad.

593
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,980
I have to use my ghost tricks to save him before that
happens.

594
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,120
Yeah, but how do I get over there?

595
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,040
My arm's too short.

596
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,580
Um, lever.

597
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,400
Um, does it do anything?

598
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:04,780
Uh.

599
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,020
Oh, there's a phone in there.

600
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,460
Nobody probably called from in there, though.

601
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,760
I don't think I have the extension.

602
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,220
Is it?

603
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,780
napping?

604
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,200
What's he doing up here?

605
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,560
Let's see.

606
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,360
Where does the water?

607
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,260
The water from there.

608
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:36,580
Hmm.

609
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,820
He's taking a little nap, you guys.

610
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,280
I guess we'll go back to him.

611
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:45,720
Oh, wait.

612
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,820
Power just...

613
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,280
Oh.

614
00:45:52,600 --> 00:46:00,380

My time will soon be locked away from me as well.

623
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:04,930
I can't waste what I have left.

624
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:05,750
I better get going.

625
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:08,590
Trick time!

00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:10,650
Yeah, so stop talking, buddy.

Oh.

630
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:19,890
Oh.

631

Oh.

632
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:23,930
Wait.

633
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:33,790
Emergency button.

634
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,890
I better not set off the emergency alarm right now.

635
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,690
The inside of my head is already in a state of emergency as
it is.

636
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:41,830
Okay, never mind.

637
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:46,370
Uh, we'll go upstairs.

638
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:49,550

Ugh, all the, all the phew, phew, phew, phew.

No.

642
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:06,480
Meow.

643
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,160
My arm is too short.

00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,000

Guess it's hard for you to know when to stop talking to.

653
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:31,190
Ooh!

654
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,220
Wait, the CV is now.

Was it always facing?

656
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,180
Wasn't it facing us before?

657
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,480
Or maybe not.

658
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,580
Nothing going on here.

659
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:52,960
Hunk!

660
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:53,680
Hunk!

661
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,820
Did they change seats?

662
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:01,800
Yeah, they did.

663
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,050
It's the panic dance.

664
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,050
Jump out of your pants.

665
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:42,070
It's the panic dance.

666
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:44,230
We're panicking.

667
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,110
We're panicking over something.

668
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:48,310
We're panicking.

669
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:51,050
We're panicking over something.

670
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:52,950
Something has gone wrong.

671
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:54,950
What could it be?

672
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,890
Something has gone wrong and it deals with me.

673
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,630
The panic dance is the panic dance.

674
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:04,670
Take off your pants!

675
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:06,550
It's the panic dance!

676
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,870
When you panic, you get hot.

677
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:10,970
And that's why you don't need pants.

678
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:14,510
It's the panic dance!

679
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I don't know!

683
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,650
But I feel...

684
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:30,830
Really concerned!

685
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,350

689
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,820
Where are my pants?

690
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,780
They're gone!

691
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,120
Were you panicking?

692
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,540
I'm in severe stress.

693
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,580
I'm overthinking it.

694
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,240
Oh, am I?

695
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,520
Does it not have to do with him?

696
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,480
Oh, I didn't mean to go that far out.

697
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:41,140
Uh, back.

698
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,020
Thanks for the pants.

699
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,940
Oh, the jeans.

700
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:03,540
Do I go to the bucket and do something?

701
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:04,980
No.

702
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,280
Doodle bob.

703
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,580
What do you mean doodle bob?

704
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:10,400
No,

705
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,600
wait, how am I supposed to get out?

706
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:27,510
There we go.

707
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:34,090
Manipulate.

708
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:36,310
This appears to be some kind of control panel.

709
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,330
I might be able to operate it.

710
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:38,130
I'll give it a try.

711
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:41,450
Peep-boop.

712
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:42,910
Oh!

713
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,150
Oh my god, I'm going to kill them.

714
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:46,850
Some lamps came on.

715
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:47,930
Not sure what that means.

716
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,250
Maybe that changed the situation, though.

717
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,430
Oh, I think they're about to die.

718
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:55,510
Uh.

719
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:57,690
Uh.

720
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:58,910
Oh, wait.

721
00:53:59,010 --> 00:53:59,850
Let's turn on the lever.

722
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,590
Let's kill these guys.

723
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:03,290
Execution!

724
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:04,890
Xagga!

725
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:07,390
Okay.

726
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:10,750
I just got a shock.

727
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:12,950
You are a shock.

728
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:16,590
Here we go.

729
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,010
Bucket.

730
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:24,230
Oh, dang it.

731
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:25,550
Fast!

732
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:28,970
Oh, I have to...

733
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:30,850
Okay, okay.

734
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:32,510
Fast!

735
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:33,390
Oh, I have to...

736
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,990
Chop, chop, chop, chop.

737
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,770
And I'm gonna rock that piece!

738
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:40,590
Woo!

739
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:41,490
Oh!

740
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:42,870
Spooky!

741
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:44,570
Son of a!

742
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:45,270
Oh!

743
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,870
And then I'm gonna rock the cart.

744
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:00,890
And then I'm gonna go back and here.

745
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:02,410
Oh, we're inside.

746
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:04,410
Same thing here.

747
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:07,770
Looks like this is just an internal phone, too.

748
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:08,850
It doesn't call outside.

749
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:16,050
So the only places I can go with this telephone are other
phones within the building that I've already possessed.

750
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:16,590
Okay.

751
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:19,610
Spooky card.

752
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:21,210
Flower vase.

753
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:23,130
Person's body.

754
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,830
Hey, can you hear me?

755
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,130
Where am I?

756
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,030
Oh, he's not alive.

757
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:35,850
He's awake!

758
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,350
This is the ghost world.

759
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:39,550
The land of the dead.

760
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:40,690
Detective Jowd.

761
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:42,950
Detective Jowd.

762
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:44,210
Who is that?

763
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:45,150
Is that me?

764
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:47,130
Oh boy, not you two.

765
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:48,630
This is getting old.

766
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:51,430
Thanks for the Superchild!

767
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:56,970
I guess I'll just give the usual explanation.

768
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:58,810
The dead lose their memories.

769
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:02,290
Oh, so I'm dead, am I?

770
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:04,430
I didn't realize that.

771
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:06,310
It's you guys, right there.

772
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,390
It's you, it's you.

773
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,090
You're looking a little thin.

774
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:11,270
You need to eat more.

775
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:14,190
That's why you can't remember anything right now.

776
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:16,490
That's fine with me.

777
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:17,150
Huh?

778
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,250
I don't like a messy room.

779
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,430
But I hate cleaning up even more.

780
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:26,010
Not having my memories is a welcome thing.

781
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:29,930
Now I don't have to have as much trash to take out.

782
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:31,990
Memories are like trash?

783
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,750
Now that I'm dead, what do I need with memories?

784
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:39,570
And things I don't need are just trash.

785
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:42,710
Not to me.

786
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:44,130
I need your memories.

787
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:48,790
Besides, I promise Lin, I try to stop your execution.

788
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:50,510
Lin?

789
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:53,550
Hmm.

790
00:56:55,930 --> 00:57:00,470
It looks like I still have a few bits and pieces of garbage
left lying around.

791
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:02,870
Why is he calling them garbage?

792
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:04,070
Wow!

793
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,430
I remember now!

794
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,820
About Lin, Jowd, and the execution?

795
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,480
What?

796
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,500
And what about you?

797
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:25,820
Who are you?

798
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,780
Yeah, you only remember those things because I told you!

799
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,100
Sir Chaddington, right there.

800
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,200
I'm Sissel.

801
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,880
I'm looking for my memory.

802
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,180
Or trash, as you call it.

803
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:40,760
Sissel.

804
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,500
Does my name ring a bell?

805
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:43,900
I think you know me.

806
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,060
Sorry.

807
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,880
It must not have been a very big piece of trash to me.

808
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:55,060
I want to let you guys know that you're all big pieces of
trash to me, okay?

809
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,240
You're all big pieces of trash.

810
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,680
Thanks, man.

811
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:09,260
I'm honored.

812
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:13,410
That's all right.

813
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:16,490
I guess you'll find out when you get your memory back.

814
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,470
But for now, I'd like you to come back with me.

815
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:21,550
Back to four minutes before your execution.

816
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:23,890
This is going to be so traumatic.

817
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:24,690
Oh my god.

818
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:27,090
It's not just a regular death.

819
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:28,150
It's an execution.

820
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:32,510
It's the nicest thing anyone's ever said.

821
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:48,370
about me yeah this is the past four minutes before my death
that's right oh sorry you'll get to see your own execution

822
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:55,970
well don't smile and say that and then we're gonna change
your fate well first can I ask you a question wait four

823
00:58:55,970 --> 00:59:00,790
minutes before this guy is dead he's not even in the chair
yet they got it done so quickly.

824
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:04,910
Lynn told you, didn't she, about what I did?

825
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:07,250
Yeah, she did.

826
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:09,570
Well, actually, we found out from a newspaper.

827
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:14,630
Then is it really the right thing to do, to save a guy like
me?

828
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:16,550
I don't know.

829
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:19,090
But Lynn believes it is.

830
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:23,270
Okay, let's get started.

831
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:30,200
Oh.

832
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:31,880
Jinkies!

833
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,040
Okay.

834
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,400
Oh no, it gets stuck.

835
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:41,300
It's clogged.

836
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:42,640
Uh-oh.

837
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,160
This is what happens when...

838
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,360
Uh-oh.

839
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:52,700
This is what happens when you flush stuff other than...
other than poop down the toilet.

840
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,560
Wait, what did he say?

841
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:53,860
Uh-oh.

842
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,480
I was too busy thinking about poop.

843
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:02,090
It's time.

844
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:03,870
Gochiso-sama-deshta.

845
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:14,010
of ketchup no

846
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:23,990
don't you do it too what was in the trash can that you
couldn't flush it or that you couldn't throw away your

847
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:28,470

848
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:44,180

finally here huh too busy thinking about poop eating choices

849
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:52,600

weren't even here yet I never thought I'd have to attend an

850
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:59,260
execution, but you know, I wonder why the justice minister
suddenly signed the order There's definitely something up

851
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,840
with that Hey, come on.

852
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,280
Let's just focus on our work.

853
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:04,900
This guy is such a doubter.

854
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,920
I love him Vivi core.

855
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:07,900
Thanks for the five gifted.

862
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:19,070
oh my god prepare to test throw the switch wait it explodes
and then he dies

863
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,470
So this is an execution, huh?

864
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:33,290
Seems to me there's got to be a safer way to do it.

865
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:37,330
It must be nice to have no memory like that.

866
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:39,710
It makes things more interesting.

867
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:40,750
I envy you.

868
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:41,750
I really do.

869
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,810
It's no laughing matter to me.

870
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:46,330
This guy's so awesome.

871
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:49,150
That was an example of a failed execution.

872
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:51,090
Although the outcome was the same.

873
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:54,070
Fail?

874
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:55,510
Ugh.

875
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:58,570
They haven't carried out an execution in a long time.

876
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:01,370
Wait, what if it was one of the guards?

877
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:07,210
We're going to switch the guard position and the chad
position.

878
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:08,710
They dragged out...

879
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:11,430
They dragged that old chair out from under some mothballs.

880
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:12,970
And I guess it had a short.

881
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:17,590
So I guess that means that if I can stop the explosion...

882
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:19,010
I don't know about that.

883
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:21,590
Then I'd be executed as planned.

884
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:23,610
And I'd still wind up just as dead.

885
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:27,050
So what should I do?

886
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:29,150
Beats me.

887
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:31,530
You're the one who came to save me.

888
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:32,690
You figure it out.

889
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:34,590
He's not making this easy.

890
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:36,710
I mean, can you even blame him?

891
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,550
I actually agree with him.

892
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,170
Rewind time.

893
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,290
Trick time.

894
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,800
Uh, who you call it?

895
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,240
How's it going down there?

896
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,520
We just finished setting up the chair.

897
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:06,680
we're all prepared I see it's time please bring in the
prisoner but but but but boot that chair it hasn't been used

898
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:19,880
in a long time but what if Bailey there's nothing we can do
now it's time all right I'll send the guards to a cell I'll

899
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:30,100
have them call when they get into position okay we go there
did he just say Do it.

900
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,420
Do it yourself.

901
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:33,300
Basically.

902
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,780
Oh my god, this guy is drunk.

903
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:41,060
I have this strange feeling of uneasiness.

904
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:42,900
I must dance it out.

905
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,040
How about you?

906
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,040
How do you feel?

907
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:51,220
I feel chubby and jittery and I can't stand still.

908
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:55,540
I feel like I might start dancing at any minute.

909
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,460
If you're gonna dance, let me know.

910
01:04:58,660 --> 01:04:59,740
I'll get the video camera.

911
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:09,840
already nobody will listen to my concerns concerns huh so
he's worried that man is always worried about something

912
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:15,860
whatever he's worried about it's always it always comes true
without fail mm-hmm

913
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:29,620
listen to me that chair is dangerous I know Bailey that's
why I don't advise you sit on you to sit on it no no no

914
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:35,800
that's not what I mean machines like that are very sensitive
to dust if the guys throw the switch in the chair shorts out

915
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:43,500
there might be a huge explosion down there in that death
chamber oh my god he called the whole thing oh come on

916
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:54,180
nothing's gonna happen besides even if the on the off chance
it does blow up we're way up here we'll be fine i know why

917
01:05:54,180 --> 01:06:03,700
don't we go and test it out first no way i don't want to get
blown up you'll go by yourself so this spot would be safe

918
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,100
even if it does blow up, eh?

919
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:06,660
What is it?

920
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,480
You have a new look in your eye.

921
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,400
Why can't I stop yawning?

922
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:18,460
If the switch in the death chamber is thrown, the chair will
blow up.

923
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:20,100
That's right.

924
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:24,360
And if the chair blows up, the execution can't be carried
out.

925
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:25,240
True.

926
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,200
It only stands to reason.

927
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:34,500
And if there's nobody in the death chamber when the chair
explodes?

928
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,760
Nobody will die.

929
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:38,620
Precisely.

930
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,300
Very nice, Sissel.

931
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,660
You've hit upon some excellent points there.

932
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,600
Okay, I'm starting to see a plan now.

933
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:46,540
Sophie!

934
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:53,850
How do we have nobody in there?

935
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:56,070
Time is passing.

936
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:57,470
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

937
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:02,250
Let's dial...

938
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:03,570
Wait, there's no...

939
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:04,350
Oh yes, that's right.

940
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:05,410
We can't use the phone lines.

941
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:11,150
I can only move over phone lines in the past when it's in
use.

942
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,950
Sadly, this applies to the internal extensions as well.

943
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:15,870
Ow, ow, ow.

944
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,430
Get everyone up there.

945
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:19,150
Exactly.

946
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:21,570
Everybody has to come up here.

947
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:22,090
Or.

948
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:24,890
Or, or, or, or, or, or.

949
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:27,990
We somehow pull the switch early.

950
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:30,370
I think.

951
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:33,830
Getting the chair to shore out.

952
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,650
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

953
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:37,410
Why can't I stop a yawning?

954
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:37,970
Hold on.

955
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:39,410
I'm gonna eat a cookie.

956
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,320
Cookie time.

957
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,340
It's cookie time.

958
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:47,320
Maybe some sugar will help me.

959
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:50,680
Eepi ghost.

960
01:07:59,430 --> 01:07:59,650
Ah!

961
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:00,930
I dropped my controller.

962
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:11,580
In the past world, I can't just use the phone lines whenever
I want.

963
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,740
These guards seem to be in a fog.

964
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,720
I doubt they'll be using the phone much.

965
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,400
Maybe I need to start over?

966
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:20,400
Wait, no!

967
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:20,740
What?

968
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,320
What do you mean?

969
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,900
Maybe I do need to start over.

970
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:52,070
I'm stuck here.

971
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,440
I thought he said he would call.

972
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,640
He said he would call when it's time for the guy to go
there.

973
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:13,760
I'm just sorry I didn't get to see Bailey's famous dancing.

974
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,560
Getting the chair to short out when nobody's around it.

975
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,780
The plan is starting to solidify in my mind.

976
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,080
But I'd better find a different path next time.

977
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:24,720
From the beginning.

978
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:29,540
Did he say he would call?

979
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,700
I thought he did say he would call.

980
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,100
Oh, bad.

981
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:36,460
I think we need to attach ourselves.

982
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:38,800
to...

983
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:40,200
Uh...

984
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,520
This guy, maybe.

985
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:48,940
Got it!

986
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,080
Oh.

987
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:54,960
Um...

988
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,220
Alright then, four minutes from now.

989
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,400
This chair will short out and explode and you'll die!

990
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,600
It's very sad.

991
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,600
If I stop the explosion, you'll be executed and you'll still
die.

992
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,660
Sorry I was ever born.

993
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:15,200
I have to protect you from the explosion and stop the
execution.

994
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,100
The key to this whole thing must be this chair.

995
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,500
I apologize for all your trouble.

996
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,260
Could you stop with the insincere comments?

997
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:26,640
Ha ha ha.

998
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,560
Wait, am I stuck here?

999
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:29,260
Oh, oh.

1000
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:31,580
Oh, here we go, here we go.

1001
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,380
Now it's time to go get the prisoner.

1002
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,000
I'm in position.

1003
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,800
The other two are coming to bring the prisoner to you now.

1004
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:40,920
Got it.

1005
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,740
I feel like we have to try every spot.

1006
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,720
Unless they call one more time, but maybe they don't.

1007
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,620
They might not call one more time.

1008
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:57,780
I don't know.

1009
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,080
I have no idea.

1010
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:00,560
I don't know.

1011
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,360
We can't get...

1012
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,560
We can go to the paper.

1013
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,040
Okay.

1014
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:08,800
Paper.

1015
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,060
Open up the note.

1016
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:14,540
Let it free.

1017
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:14,780
Oh!

1018
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,200
Alright, my jam grooved off the clock.

1019
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,760
Now get down there to Sausage Head.

1020
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,060
Go, go, go!

1021
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:25,940
Okay.

1022
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:27,940
Oh, wait.

1023
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:34,900
Wait, that's about to- Ew, that was terrifying.

1024
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,620
Oh, God, he's so gross.

1025
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:46,630
Okay.

1026
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:50,050
Okay.

1027
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:51,490
Okay.

1028
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:53,650
What is this for?

1029
01:11:54,130 --> 01:12:01,470
in the present world four minutes into the future sausage
head was lying passed out in the tunnel oh I wonder if like

1030
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:09,530
the shock got him not knowing about the execution he must
have kept digging and digging and the guards didn't notice

1031
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:18,770
he was gone so I guess Curry's man Curry man's future has
now changed a bit fate changed okay oh

1032
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:30,630
can't reach it but we need to get to oh

1033
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:47,220
yes we ring this because he needs to go back downstairs
right he needs to go back why is he so freaky he needs to we

1034
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:55,620
need to go with him back in there because that's how we get
into the other room ew and he licks it okay attach to the

1035
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:59,120
spoon yeah we're gonna use him we're gonna use him

1036
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:04,380
come on hurry it up

1037
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:25,340
oh never mind I thought he would go back inside just kidding
but that's okay we can now go to his place to you and um the

1038
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:31,820
napkin what did he do with the napkin again oh he also
flushed the napkin he also flushed the napkin I think we

1039
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:40,840
have to be the napkin And then when we get flushed, we can
then go downstairs, probably.

1040
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:44,940
After looking in the trash can.

1041
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:45,900
Yeah, what's in there?

1042
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:46,900
Open?

1043
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:48,080
Oh!

1044
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:51,940
Wait a second!

1045
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1046
01:13:58,170 --> 01:14:00,450
Wait, how do we get the circle?

1047
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,720
I might have to restart.

1048
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,560
Oh, we notice it's full.

1049
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:15,080
This thing is as full as I am.

1050
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,540
Oh, no.

1051
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:23,020
It needed to be.

1052
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,040
Okay.

1053
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:24,940
We know, though.

1054
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:25,480
We know, no.

1055
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:26,740
We know now.

1056
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:27,800
We know now.

1057
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,320
If he gets it...

1058
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,660
I'm actually curious.

1059
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,600
If he grabs this, will we be able to do it again, I wonder?

1060
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,360
We know, no.

1061
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,460
We know, no.

1062
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,400
It's too late.

1063
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,940
Is it because he's not eating anymore?

1064
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,240
Oh, oh, shoot.

1065
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:53,880
Oh, shoot.

1066
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:54,620
Oh, shoot.

1067
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:55,540
Oh, shoot.

1068
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,220
There we go.

1069
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,020
I almost missed my chance.

1070
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,140
Oh, okay.

1071
01:14:59,260 --> 01:14:59,540
Never mind.

1072
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,400
It's too late.

1073
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:01,820
We gotta restart.

1074
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:02,800
We gotta restart.

1075
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:05,180
He's not eating anymore.

1076
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,920
He's just sitting there.

1077
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:10,800
It's so sad.

1078
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:11,980
Okay, let's restart.

1079
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:14,260
After fate change.

1080
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:14,560
Okay.

1081
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,100
That's okay.

1082
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:22,180
Now...

1083
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:22,900
Uh...

1084
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:25,340
Your soup!

1085
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:30,600
Do you have a favorite instant curry brand?

1086
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,040
I've only ever bought Vermont curry, but I feel like maybe I
should look at others.

1087
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:39,780
PS prisons open all doors that the power goes out, so that
if there's a fire, it won't burn all the inmates.

1088
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,240
Oh!

1089
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:42,780
Which has happened before?

1090
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,120
There has been fires in...

1091
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:47,500
Was it?

1092
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:47,920
What was it?

1093
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,160
Was it Alcatraz?

1094
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,220
Oh my gosh.

1095
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:56,440
I want to go to Alcatraz so badly.

1096
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:00,920
I want to go.

1097
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:07,460
But the one day that Mia Matara can maybe go, they
weren't...

1098
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:08,900
They were all full.

1099
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,860
I just dropped my drink.

1100
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:12,300
Hold on.

1101
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:18,010
I don't know.

1102
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:19,810
Oh, man.

1103
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:32,780
man i think it's fine i just dropped the straw side right
onto the floor though so i can't drink any more of it that's

1104
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:45,780

been to san francisco before but because of off kai i can go

01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:54,900
i will be able to visit so i was like i want to visit can't
go because I don't well I don't I don't know we might maybe

1106
01:16:54,900 --> 01:17:03,140
try a different time if there's any openings or if they're
if the place is open too but

1107
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,160
yeah I want to I want to go I want to go

1112
01:17:56,020 --> 01:18:00,820
The way he like slorps his spoon is so weird.

1113
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,200
Oh my gosh, I have to be pretty...

1114
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,080
I have to go pretty quickly with this, I think.

1115
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:09,620
Huh?

1116
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,220
Oh, Will.

1117
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:14,600
I missed Regalia.

1118
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,500
Me too.

1119
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,440
I missed Regalia so much.

1120
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:18,300
All right.

1121
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,620
What is the order here?

1122
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:25,660
maybe

1123
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:45,560
i might have to restart one more time but he like he has to
be holding his i think one okay i think it's the timing of

1124
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:55,740
when he's holding the napkin over the trash can but before
he opens it right yeah it needs the oh it needs oh now now

1125
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:58,520
now yeah yeah

1126
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:03,590
Wow.

1127
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:09,690
Oh, let me possess the napkin.

1128
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:17,070
Perfect timing.

1129
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,230
Ringling!

1130
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:25,630
Time is passing.

1131
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:28,210
Okay, and now we're gonna possess the spoon.

1132
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:30,590
Once he brings us up.

1133
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:32,230
Once he brings us up.

1134
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,120
Can I reach it now?

1135
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:38,420
No, not yet.

1136
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:42,080
Time is passing.

1137
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1138
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:47,260
Spoon!

1139
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:50,860
Ta-da!

1140
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:55,730
Okay, very nice.

1141
01:19:57,490 --> 01:20:00,470
This is the most lax prison I've ever seen ever.

1142
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:01,850
Okay.

1143
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:02,630
Alright.

1144
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:04,250
Alright, hurry up, please!

1145
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:04,870
Hurry up!

1146
01:20:05,530 --> 01:20:06,030
Oh!

1147
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:06,570
Oh,

1148
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:09,830
God.

1149
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:11,130
Okay, come on, crawl!

1150
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:12,470
Crawl, man!

1151
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:12,950
Crawl!

1152
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:13,270
Ah!

1153
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:17,910
Okay, okay.

1154
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:31,890
Sorry, that guy was still in the hole, but...

1155
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:37,850
Oh, what just happened?

1156
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:41,090
We just stopped to death.

1157
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:44,350
The power's down throughout the whole facility.

1158
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:45,590
No way.

1159
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:47,370
If the power's down, that means...

1160
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:50,170
All the cell bars open automatically!

1161
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:54,110
Damn it, the internal phones aren't working either!

1162
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:55,550
State of emergency!

1163
01:20:56,650 --> 01:21:00,450
Now the execution can't be carried out and your life is
saved.

1164
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:08,210
Crisis Averted You're a pretty daring guy!

1165
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:12,610
I really enjoyed myself, and I think I learned a thing or
two as well.

1166
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:14,210
About what?

1167
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:17,430
By the way, is it true what the guard says?

1168
01:21:17,450 --> 01:21:19,450
The cell bars open automatically?

1169
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:21,670
Jail break!

1170
01:21:22,930 --> 01:21:23,590
Yep, it's true.

1171
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:25,450
It's a little drawback to the system.

1172
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:30,110
If the entire facility blacks out, the locks are released
for the prisoners' safety.

1173
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:33,870
But nobody thought it would actually ever happen.

1174
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:39,270
So in other words, now is the time to escape if you're
gonna.

1175
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:42,090
Anyway, we managed to stop the execution.

1176
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:43,870
Let's get back to the present.

1177
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:46,570
You're still not out of the woods yet.

1178
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:48,990
And Now that guy's gonna get his memories back.

1179
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,190
He can tell us who we are.

1180
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:50,910
Oh my gosh.

1181
01:21:51,550 --> 01:21:53,570
Oh, let me give you one piece of advice.

1182
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:54,990
What's that?

1183
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:58,710
When we get back to the present, head for the spoon.

1184
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:00,510
Okay.

1185
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:01,650
Spoon?

1186
01:22:01,970 --> 01:22:02,210
Huh?

1187
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:04,670
You'll see when we get back, Sissel.

1188
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:07,870
Okay, time to go to the spoon.

1189
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:12,110
Spoon, spoon, spoon.

1190
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:13,770
Oh my gosh, he wants to spoon me.

1191
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:16,890
Now the execution can't be carried out.

1192
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:18,970
Jowd is safe for the moment.

1193
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:20,950
A new present has been born.

1194
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:26,630
Jowd still isn't safe from execution, of course.

1195
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,810
I guess I still have a job to do.

1196
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:31,410
Help a death row inmate escape from prison.

1197
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:32,590
Oh, yeah.

1198
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:39,570
Yippee!

1199
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:44,670
We cleared the 1055 to 1109 challenge.

1200
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:47,930
Jowd taking by fate.

1201
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:49,990
Nice.

1202
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:51,330
That one wasn't so bad.

1203
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:57,630
Oh, this level coming up is the worst level in the game.

1204
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:58,570
Uh-oh.

1205
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:00,450
Okay.

1206
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:03,850
I'm mentally preparing myself.

1207
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:05,910
Yeah, that chapter was pretty short.

1208
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:10,010
Now I'm back in the present, and it's completely shrouded in
darkness.

1209
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:13,390
I can't see it, but I can feel the tension in the air.

1210
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:14,810
It's a state of emergency.

1211
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:16,290
Yeah, it's not good.

1212
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:17,710
You'll see why very quickly.

1213
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:18,690
It's really rough.

1214
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:20,470
Okay, thanks guys for the warning.

1215
01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:22,130
And that's only natural.

1216
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:25,310
With the power failure, all of the cell bars opened
automatically.

1217
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:28,570
Plus now a death row inmate is loose in the darkness.

1218
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,020
I did what I promised Lynn.

1219
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,680
I stopped the execution.

1220
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:40,600
But that condemned criminal is now in just as much danger as
before.

1221
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:43,660
Okay, to the spoon.

1222
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,440
What are these guys?

1223
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,100
Oh, these guys are working on it.

1224
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:51,580
Let's go to the spoon.

1225
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:54,900
Okay, I'm here.

1226
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:02,850
The detective told me to head for the spoon when I got back
to the present.

1227
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:04,250
So here I am.

1228
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:07,930
And he is asleep, like before.

1229
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:10,410
Oh, he's awake!

1230
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:11,370
Oh god.

1231
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:13,010
He's gonna like...

1232
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:13,430
The bell!

1233
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:14,330
Better get back!

1234
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:16,630
Oh god, he's so scary!

1235
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:17,510
This guy!

1236
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:22,870
Woo, I'm back!

1237
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:25,910
Thank goodness someone flushed his toilet.

1238
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:27,430
That was good timing.

1239
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:30,850
Now to use the cover of darkness to help the detective
escape.

1240
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:33,030
But first I have to find him.

1241
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:33,810
Oh gosh.

1242
01:24:34,230 --> 01:24:35,530
Is this like a sneaking mission?

1243
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:38,250
But in this game...

1244
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:40,330
Huh?

1245
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:41,990
Oh!

1246
01:24:42,090 --> 01:24:43,270
Oh my god.

1247
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:46,310
It's prisoner C74!

1248
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:47,570
Secure the prisoner!

1249
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:49,550
Oh no.

1250
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:50,650
I see.

1251
01:24:53,790 --> 01:24:57,830
Oh, no, it looks like there are hunters in this darkness.

1252
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:00,610
I hope they haven't found Detective Jowd.

1253
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:03,830
Oh, no.

1254
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,350
Where is he?

1255
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:11,770
He's not here.

1256
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:14,770
Oh, oh, what's that red light?

1257
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:19,530
Hmm, looks like the hunter's eyes glow red.

1258
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:27,900
Oh, no.

1259
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:31,880
It doesn't look like escape is going to be easy.

1260
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:32,580
Round.

1261
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:38,880
Look at him.

1262
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:38,940
Oh my god.

1263
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,160
Look at him.

1264
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:47,320
Oh my god.

1265
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:49,740
Wow.

1266
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:51,500
He's just a ball.

1267
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:56,310
Let's talk to him.

1268
01:25:57,990 --> 01:25:58,790
Ah, there you are.

1269
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:00,350
I was wondering what I was going to do.

1270
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,290
Are you the one who made that toilet bell ring?

1271
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:04,470
That's right.

1272
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,670
I still had another napkin lying around.

1273
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:08,850
Thanks to that, I managed to make it here.

1274
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:10,950
How did you know how to do that?

1275
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:16,310
I learned a few things about your ghost tricks during our
time together.

1276
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:18,870
Peak form.

1277
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:20,330
I love him.

1278
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:31,660
They certainly can be very useful powers, but at times, not
so much.

1279
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:37,940
I knew that if the internal phones weren't working, you'd be
trapped in the death chamber area.

1280
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,200
So I quickly came up with an alternative route.

1281
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:46,460
How did he know about the guy digging underneath this prison
though?

1282
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:48,460
Does everyone just know that?

1283
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:53,820
A route that made use of sausage head spoon in my napkin.

1284
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:56,100
Wow, this detective is good.

1285
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,420
He's pretty good.

1286
01:26:58,620 --> 01:27:00,520
Next time you praise me, go ahead and say it out loud.

1287
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,540
He can read my thoughts.

1288
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:03,020
I forgot.

1289
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,700
Oh yeah, he did see me in there, right?

1290
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:06,180
That's true.

1291
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:06,540
That's true.

1292
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:10,720
Anyway, it looks like it's time for a strategy meeting.

1293
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:12,920
An escape strategy, huh?

1294
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,480
This could be interesting.

1295
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:15,490
Let's do it.

1296
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:18,220
Escape strategy.

1297
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,060
Let's make sure we're both clear.

1298
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,860
The key to my escape is this darkness.

1299
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:30,740
Once the basement power supply is restored, escape will be
impossible.

1300
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:31,440
Okay, okay.

1301
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:35,060
Thanks for the Superchild Empire.

1302
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,100
Thank you.

1303
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,720
So we move under cover of darkness, huh?

1304
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,780
I know I won't have much trouble with that.

1305
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,300
But I'm afraid I won't be able to see.

1306
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:45,860
So you'll have to lead the way.

1307
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,000
Lead the way?

1308
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:50,280
Cicil sometimes like...

1309
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,160
Cicil sometimes kind of like snake.

1310
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:53,420
Lead the way.

1311
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:58,400
Once you find a safe spot for me to move to, I want you to
give me a signal.

1312
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:01,500
Anchor, thanks for this over time.

1313
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,960
Okay, fine, but how?

1314
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,280
Second floor basement.

1315
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:18,160
way the dead don't have voices even if they did we have to
be quiet don't you worry about that I have an idea let's

1316
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:24,900
just try it and you'll see how it works this detective likes
to just dive right into things even more than Lynn does I

1317
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:39,220
wonder if they're related if they find me I imagine they'll
shoot first and ask questions later Did they shoot sausage

1318
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:39,560
head?

1319
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:42,800
But if I die again, we can just start over, right?

1320
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:44,740
He says cheerfully.

1321
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:47,080
Prison security.

1322
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:50,380
I don't know if you know it or not, but this is a special
prison.

1323
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,540
There aren't many, there aren't any dangerous criminals
here.

1324
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:54,920
Except for me, that is.

1325
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:58,860
Yes, I did hear something about it being a special place.

1326
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,100
Sausage man is fine.

1327
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:02,900
He was in his cell.

1328
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,160
Oh, so if you leave the cell, they'll shoot.

1329
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:09,320
and because

1330
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:20,710
of the special status they're not prepared at all for
emergencies they have four timid security guards at most you

1331
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:29,490
would think that would make them the fact that it's a
special prison would make them more like prepared it's mint

1332
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:37,930
real it's me I think I saw some hunters lurking in the
darkness though those are the guards they're wearing night

1333
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:44,990
vision goggles Ah, uh, I wonder, I wonder, night vision
goggles.

1334
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:49,850
Who, who needs night vision goggles?

1335
01:29:50,770 --> 01:29:52,270
You don't even need those.

1336
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:56,510
What stupid, what a stupid invest, what a stupid thing to
try.

1337
01:29:57,730 --> 01:29:58,930
Night vision goggles?

1338
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:00,990
Like who even, okay.

1339
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:05,590
Okay, I'll, I'll, I'll.

1340
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:09,170
Night vision goggles.

1341
01:30:10,930 --> 01:30:19,950
night vision goggles there's special glasses that lets you
see in the dark very handy things if I enter their field of

1342
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:26,810
vision it's all over so it's all about staying out of the
guards is line of sight day make sure you guide me to safe

1343
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:38,110
spots like under the table okay now about that signal I want
you to give me yeah how am I supposed to do it I've already

1344
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:43,090
been dead once I don't know if it's because of that or what,
but I can sense your powers now.

1345
01:30:43,670 --> 01:30:44,050
Ooh.

1346
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:46,230
You what?

1347
01:30:47,090 --> 01:30:49,490
For example, you're in the bunk right now, aren't you?

1348
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:51,170
Yeah.

1349
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:54,050
I guess you have a sixth sense.

1350
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:57,290
I think it's more like a detective sense.

1351
01:30:58,390 --> 01:30:59,590
That doesn't sound right somehow.

1352
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:02,810
Anyway, the details don't matter.

1353
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:04,750
Do you see this R here?

1354
01:31:05,690 --> 01:31:06,190
Yes.

1355
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:09,030
Where did that come from?

1356
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:14,350
Do you see this R button here?

1357
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:21,170
Snake, turn off the console.

1358
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:24,670
I mean, ride and turn off.

1359
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:27,850
R button?

1360
01:31:30,370 --> 01:31:31,450
Let's use it as our signal.

1361
01:31:32,730 --> 01:31:33,490
How will that work?

1362
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:35,750
If you press R, I'll sense it.

1363
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:37,470
Then I'll move to wherever you are.

1364
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:39,630
So for example...

1365
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:42,630
A spoon?

1366
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:46,650
If you move to that spoon and press R, I'll run to the
spoon.

1367
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:47,550
Simple, right?

1368
01:31:48,850 --> 01:31:49,330
Alright.

1369
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:50,470
Fine.

1370
01:31:50,770 --> 01:31:52,170
Let's start our escape plan.

1371
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:55,650
Just make sure you guide me to safe spots, sisal.

1372
01:31:58,730 --> 01:31:59,210
Oh.

1373
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:02,750
So...

1374
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:03,510
Oh, okay.

1375
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:08,950
What is this part?

1376
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:10,850
Oh, bulletproof vest.

1377
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:11,130
Okay.

1378
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:13,430
Alright, so if I move...

1379
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:33,170
here and if I press R after after this after he turns around
oh wait go under the table what are you doing he's gonna see

1380
01:32:33,170 --> 01:32:46,090
you I was like he's gonna check out what the enemy is doing.

1381
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:48,830
For now, how about just aiming for the neighboring cell?

1382
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:51,170
We can't hurry too much in this darkness.

1383
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:52,190
Let's take it slow.

1384
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:53,810
I tried!

1385
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:55,710
Joud?

1386
01:32:56,850 --> 01:32:56,910
Joud?

1387
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:57,790
Joud!

1388
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:01,170
Joud!

1389
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:02,890
Oh, okay.

1390
01:33:03,970 --> 01:33:04,310
Okay.

1391
01:33:06,950 --> 01:33:08,170
What is this?

1392
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:09,890
Hatch mechanism.

1393
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:14,360
Open.

1394
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:20,360
Interesting.

1395

01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:54,350

far but unless I tell him to go all the way over here.

1398
01:33:57,710 --> 01:33:58,150
Go.

1399
01:33:58,490 --> 01:33:59,450
Run, run, run, run.

Oh, yeah.

1406
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,770
Oh, I have to wait for him to come back.

1407
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:23,360
He's going up the stairs?

1408
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:25,200
Oh, I can't see.

1409
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,200
And he's going all the way up.

1410
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:33,400
Look at him go.

1411
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:35,500
Wee!

1412
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:37,840
He's going down the stairs.

1413
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:40,940
He's back to where we are.

1414
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:42,340
Okay.

1415
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:46,910
Let's follow him.

1416
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:53,820
What do we have?

1417
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:55,340
What is that?

1418
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,040
What is that?

1419
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:58,560
Oh, that's the cover of the toilet.

1420
01:34:59,020 --> 01:34:59,680
Okay.

1421
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:00,740
Uh...

1422
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:02,360
Let's see where he goes, actually.

1423
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:04,540
Is there anything over here?

1424
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:07,100
There's...

1425
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:08,440
What the?

1426
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:09,980
Is that a guy lying down?

1427
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:11,120
Oh my god.

1428
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,120
Wait, he scared me.

1429
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:16,880
What is that?

1430
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:19,720
Oh, there's a guy in between!

1431
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:24,820
What's this?

1432
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,740
Oh, empty can.

1433
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:30,800
Hmm, this area under the stairs is a blind spot for the
guards.

1434
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:44,380
find him here this spot is safe okay we have to wait for him
to we have to wait for him to will he oh gosh we'll have to

1435
01:35:44,380 --> 01:36:00,030
start from the very beginning though if we okay will he like
walk behind the guards you know so if I'm like go go now

1436
01:36:04,330 --> 01:36:05,970
Wait, how do you see him?

1437
01:36:07,630 --> 01:36:08,150
Okay.

1438
01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:11,270
What just happened?

1439
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:14,210
Apparently there was a hunter lurking in the ceiling.

1440
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:16,190
Could you do something about him?

1441
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,470
It's so dark, I can't even see the bullet coming.

1442
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:22,770
He dodged the bullet if it wasn't dark?

1443
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:29,240
Okay.

1444
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:30,480
Okay, okay.

1445
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:32,480
Wait, is this the very beginning?

1446
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:33,780
Oh, man.

1447
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:36,580
Oh, man.

1448
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:37,780
Okay, okay.

1449
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,280
I think...

1450
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:43,600
Oh, wait.

1451
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:44,080
Open.

1452
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:44,740
I'm gonna...

1453
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:46,040
I'm going to...

1454
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:46,420
I'm going to...

1455
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:46,900
I'm going to open this up.

1456
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:52,140
I'm gonna open up this little mechanism in the meantime
because I feel like we're gonna need it later.

1457
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:54,840
Unless...

1458
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:57,320
Did me opening that open all the other ones?

1459
01:36:58,700 --> 01:36:59,840
I don't think so.

1460
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:01,380
Mint is so cute.

1461
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:02,740
What do you mean?

1462
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:03,980
What do you mean?

1463
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:12,300

Maybe now!

1472
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,020
A valve.

1473
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:35,060
Open?

1474
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:35,540
Wait.

1475
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:37,000
Oh!

1476
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:38,580
Oh, y'all!

1477
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:43,280
Oh, now they're both walking.

1478
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:43,700
Hello?

1479
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:45,360
Okay, wait.

1480
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:49,100
Wait, this doesn't...

1481
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:51,980
Oh, I wish I could, like, drop this on his head, but it's a
valve.

1482
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:52,760
Okay.

1483
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:56,000
Wait, this doesn't seem very good.

1484
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:57,300
Oh wait, wait.

1485
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:00,420
Does he just walk back up and close it again?

1486
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:02,080
Or...

1487
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:03,660
Hold on, let's see what happens here.

1488
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:10,480
What's he doing?

1489
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,800
He's going all the way up.

1490
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:23,080
I'm stuck here, actually.

1491
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,540
If I close this, does he lay back down?

1492
01:39:42,730 --> 01:39:43,210
Whoopsie.

1493
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,130
Oh, this one's tough, though.

1494
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:56,190
The timing on this is really rough.

1495
01:39:57,530 --> 01:39:58,430
I think.

1496
01:39:59,330 --> 01:40:00,310
Oh, he fell again.

1497
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:07,220
He fell again.

1498
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:08,960
Okay.

1499
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:10,600
Maybe.

1500
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:12,180
Now.

1501
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:17,840
Oh my god, that was so close.

1502
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:21,400
Holy cow, that was so close.

1503
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:22,640
Oh gosh.

1504
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:25,200
Okay, okay, okay.

1505
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:27,600
Um...

1506
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:28,520
Oh, man!

1507
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:44,650
We're gonna close that up so he stops dropping.

1508
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,820
Come on, I can't reach you!

1509
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,160
Come a little closer.

1510
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,140
Get close to Minto.

1511
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:00,060
Wait, though.

1512
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:01,400
Oh, I was like, hello?

1513
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:09,940
Oh, wait.

1514
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:12,220
Oh, I followed the wrong guy!

1515
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:14,440
Don't stop!

1516
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:18,220
Close.

1517
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:22,140
Oh, so I can't close this right now.

1518
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:23,780
Somebody is falling through it.

1519
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,100
Okay, now we can close it.

1520
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:31,440
Where should we go next, though?

1521
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:33,960
Where can he hide next?

1522
01:41:38,910 --> 01:41:41,310
Waste basket, toilet.

1523
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:45,250
There's like nothing here.

1524
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:48,470
Hmm.

1525
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:57,010
Okay, he should come over here.

1526
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,780
Not yet.

1527
01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:06,350
Here?

1528
01:42:06,730 --> 01:42:08,610
Okay, okay, okay, there we go.

1529
01:42:11,730 --> 01:42:12,810
Wait, where do I go?

1530
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:16,690
This part is tricky.

1531
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,240
The valve seems important.

1532
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:27,120
But the valve...

1533
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:29,200
I can't do any ghost trick to it.

1534
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,580
She just stops right there?

1535
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:42,160
Oh, no, he keeps going.

1536
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:42,840
He keeps going.

1537
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:44,260
Okay.

1538
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:46,060
Where are we going?

1539
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:50,160
Are you kidding me?

1540
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:56,200
Oh, boy.

1541
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:57,620
No way.

1542
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,200
No way.

1543
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,260
No way.

1544
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:04,660
You have to go all the way.

1545
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:06,400
Over there?

1546
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:07,700
No.

1547
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:09,440
Is that real?

1548
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:11,780
Yes way?

1549
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:25,240
Chat, is this real?

1550
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:36,470
There's nothing...

1551
01:43:36,470 --> 01:43:38,050
Unless, um...

1552
01:43:39,830 --> 01:43:40,990
Unless the valve.

1553
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:44,730
Unless...

1554
01:43:44,730 --> 01:43:47,650
Maybe if I... if he hides in the ceiling, will they still
see him?

1555
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:52,030
Maybe they won't see him if he hides in the ceiling.

1556
01:43:54,970 --> 01:43:58,730
Okay, I'm gonna have to wait for somebody to come rescue me
from the bunk.

1557
01:44:00,570 --> 01:44:03,350
Come rescue me from the bunk, please.

1558
01:44:03,930 --> 01:44:04,630
Keep going.

1559
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:05,490
Walk.

1560
01:44:06,490 --> 01:44:06,930
Come here, boy.

1561
01:44:08,430 --> 01:44:08,590
Yeah.

1562
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:10,670
That's right.

1563
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:17,950
You know what, it's better to try that than trying nothing
at all.

1564
01:44:19,070 --> 01:44:19,990
Let's go to the valve.

1565
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:26,760
And just sitting here wondering, you know?

1566
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:28,600
If we die, we just get here again.

1567
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:32,000
If we die, we just...

1568
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,400
Trick our way back.

1569
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:35,140
Oh wait.

1570
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:36,760
Uh...

1571
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:38,620
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1572
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:40,540
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1573
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:42,020
You invited me to come get you.

1574
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:43,180
I pressed the...

1575
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:43,880
I pressed sorry.

1576
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:44,640
Sorry.

1577
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:47,720
My bad.

1578
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:50,400
My bad.

1579
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:51,600
Don't do that.

1580
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:53,280
Okay.

1581
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,320
Okay, here!

1582
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:04,970
Okay, he's gonna go down.

1583
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:09,630
And while he's walking away, he's walking that way.

1584
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:14,580
He's gonna go.

1585
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,780
Okay, go, go, go!

1586
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,760
What do you want me to climb up into the ceiling?

1587
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,460
I think I can manage that.

1588
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,320
But as things stand, I don't have access.

1589
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:27,580
Oh, no!

1590
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,740
Could you open that hatch and create...

1591
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:32,020
an entry point for me.

1592
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,260
Oh, you lost your chance!

1593
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:39,240
Wait, maybe actually this guy will be stuck on this side.

1594
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:40,620
What?

1595
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:41,400
Okay.

1596
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:42,560
Okay, now.

1597
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,060
Wait, he's turning around!

1598
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:49,000
Oh no, he's gonna get seen.

1599
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:52,720
Is this guy gonna fall through the floor?

1600
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:55,160
Ah, I should have.

1601
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:57,020
Yeah, no time.

1602
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:02,180
This guy's gonna fall through the floor.

1603
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:05,540
There we go.

1604
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:08,380
Okay.

1605
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:10,140
Let's close the hatch.

1606
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:17,860
Wait, they're both going up now.

1607
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:21,200
Oh, but one will continue going up and one will turn around.

1608
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:28,440
All right, as soon as he's passed.

1609
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:30,380
Thank you!

1610
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:31,840
As soon as he's passed.

1611
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:33,580
Oh, gosh.

1612
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:37,920
The timing on this is like Why do you have to stop right
there, man?

1613
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:45,310
There's no time!

1614
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:46,650
There's no time!

1615
01:46:48,130 --> 01:46:50,270
Made some delicious al dente parmesan.

1616
01:46:50,890 --> 01:46:53,470
And cheddar cheese pasta with broccoli and chicken.

1617
01:46:54,170 --> 01:46:54,910
Please stop.

1618
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:56,550
I'm so hungry.

1619
01:46:57,010 --> 01:46:58,390
I even perfected my rule.

1620
01:46:59,030 --> 01:47:00,410
Added some fred pepper flakes.

1621
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:02,510
It was really good.

1622
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:04,090
Mint streams give me energy.

1623
01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:06,510
That sounds amazing.

1624
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:08,770
Oh, also, Yanwei, I forgot to answer.

1625
01:47:08,770 --> 01:47:12,890
My favorite instant curry, I actually really like the...

1626
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:20,310
Um, I really like, I don't remember the brand actually.

1627
01:47:21,610 --> 01:47:22,950
Hold on, let me look it up.

1628
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:30,050
I've actually never tried the Vermont curry before, but I
like, I like, uh, apple curry.

1629
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:31,090
Curry.

1630
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:34,910
It's, it's a golden curry.

1631
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:36,430
The golden curry one.

1632
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:38,090
Hmm.

1633
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:40,510
I like it.

1634
01:47:43,310 --> 01:47:44,090
But I've never had the Vermont.

1635
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:46,250
But I just add my own apples to it.

1636
01:47:47,150 --> 01:47:47,590
Golden.

1637
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:48,890
I'll try it out next time.

1638
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:52,990
Whenever I make curry, I use the golden curry.

1639
01:47:57,870 --> 01:47:58,750
Oh, geez.

1640
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:01,230
Oh, cheese.

1641
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:04,330
Hey, we're not gonna...

1642
01:48:05,310 --> 01:48:06,330
Maybe I have to...

1643
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,480
Maybe I have to close this.

1644
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:13,380
Again.

1645
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:17,360
Because he's gonna come back.

1646
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:20,080
I don't want him to fall down the stairs.

1647
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:24,260
There he is.

1648
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:27,360
Then he goes down.

1649
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:28,460
What?

1650
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,040
The timing on this is whack!

1651
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:33,600
The timing on this is so whack!

1652
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:39,440
Because he immediately turns around, but this guy stops
here.

1653
01:48:40,660 --> 01:48:41,100
Yeah.

1654
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,600
The timing was okay before you dropped him.

1655
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:55,520
Maybe, yeah.

1656
01:48:57,460 --> 01:48:57,760
Okay.

1657
01:48:58,280 --> 01:48:59,560
Okay, maybe...

1658
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:00,560
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

1659
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:08,070
Ah, maybe I do need to drop him again to reset the timing.

1660
01:49:10,370 --> 01:49:12,590
Maybe this will help reset the timing, actually.

1661
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:23,720
Okay.

1662
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:28,540
This is a bit better.

1663
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:29,520
This is a bit better.

1664
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:29,840
Okay, okay.

1665
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:30,460
Okay, okay, okay.

1666
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:32,900
Walk.

1667
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:34,280
Walk, walk, walk.

1668
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:36,820
Trick.

1669
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:39,560
And then here, here.

1670
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:41,540
And then, just go.

1671
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:41,940
Just go.

1672
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:43,280
Go, go.

1673
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:49,070
Oh my god, that scared me.

1674
01:49:50,730 --> 01:49:55,540
I just can't seem to find the brick I need.

1675
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:57,420
And you'll just have to make one.

1676
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:58,400
Make one.

1677
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:03,640
Try calling me to all kinds of different places.

1678
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:05,040
I'm agreeable.

1679
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:06,360
go pretty much anywhere.

1680
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:12,840
Okay, I can see why you guys said this is not a good level.

1681
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:15,000
No, we have to...

1682
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:15,160
Wait!

1683
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:18,060
Oh, thank goodness we don't have to start at the very
beginning.

1684
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:19,680
Oh, yeah!

1685
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:21,540
The game is kind to us.

1686
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:25,700
Oops.

1687
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:28,580
Okay, good, good.

1688
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,780
Come over here.

1689
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:38,300
Oh, and it's closed.

1690
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:38,940
Okay.

1691
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:48,370
Wait, this might actually be it.

1692
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:55,900
Wait, this might be it.

1693
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:14,530
Now close the hatch.

1694
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:19,530
They won't see him now, right?

1695
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:32,700
I love making super spicy curry with pineapple in it because
the sweet mix with the heat is great.

1696
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:36,320
it feels wrong.

1697
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:41,440
I can't have spicy, so I like sweet curry.

1698
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:44,080
But pineapple curry sounds pretty good, too.

1699
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,160
That's the most precise part?

1700
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:53,180
So now...

1701
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:54,820
Oh, it's so scary.

1702
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:05,460
Oh, wait.

1703
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:06,140
No, no, no.

1704
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:06,500
Stop!

1705
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:07,920
Cancel, cancel, cancel.

1706
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:12,620
Oh, wait.

1707
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:16,980
No, I need to get to the I need to get to the...

1708
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:16,980
Okay.

1709
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:17,500
Wait.

1710
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:20,000
Oh, you have to open this, though, don't I?

1711
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:23,260
I have to open this.

1712
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:26,620
Yeah, now we make him fall.

1713
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:27,660
Wait, no, no, no.

1714
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:28,000
Wait.

1715
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:29,220
Wait.

1716
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:32,060
Okay.

1717
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:35,340
I have to be, like, super good timing because I have to open
this.

1718
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:37,480
Wait, I don't have to open it?

1719
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:39,620
Oh, I don't.

1720
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:40,600
Oh, okay.

1721
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:41,720
Let's just go to the bunk then.

1722
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:42,920
Just roll?

1723
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:43,820
Oh.

1724
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:45,160
Okay.

1725
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:47,940
Wait a second.

1726
01:52:48,940 --> 01:52:53,560
Oh, well, if I get him over here, there's nowhere else to go
from here.

1727
01:52:58,170 --> 01:52:58,570
So...

1728
01:52:58,570 --> 01:52:58,910
Oh, wait!

1729
01:52:59,050 --> 01:52:59,450
Ah, come back!

1730
01:52:59,570 --> 01:52:59,650
Come back!

1731
01:52:59,870 --> 01:53:00,550
Come back!

1732
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:00,910
Sir!

1733
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:10,240
Maybe, actually, he can go over here.

1734
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:13,260
Um...

1735
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:16,260
There's nowhere, like, down here to lead him to, though.

1736
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:21,200
This guy turns around eventually, right?

1737
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:27,700
A good officer would turn around and check his back.

1738
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:33,820
A good officer would turn around and make sure no one's
sneaking up on him in the dark!

1739
01:53:39,830 --> 01:53:41,650
Check the wall.

1740
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:52,400
No!

1741
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:53,280
Oh!

1742
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:58,160
Okay, okay, okay.

1743
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:03,120
Can I like tell him to come over here?

1744
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:04,460
How do I tell him to come over here?

1745
01:54:18,990 --> 01:54:19,550
now

1746
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:39,670

1749
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:05,230
The basement generator has been repaired.

1750
01:55:05,710 --> 01:55:07,210
Restoring power to all areas.

1751
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:09,790
Oh.

1752
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:11,170
Uh-oh.

1753
01:55:12,070 --> 01:55:12,870
Uh-oh.

1754
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:18,240
Run!

1755
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:21,540
Don't just stand there.

1756
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:25,620
But the question is, what now?

1757
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:27,760
I don't have anywhere else to go.

1758
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:28,520
Do I?

1759
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:30,040
Maybe I'll go back to my cell.

1760
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:31,660
You better be kidding!

1761
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:33,760
But I'm still a condemned...

1762
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:43,380
criminal you know I doubt anybody'd welcome me with open
arms why don't you try contacting Lynn she went to see some

1763
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:51,020
justice minister guy so an escaped death row convict is
supposed to just report into the justice minister is that it

1764
01:55:51,020 --> 01:55:59,420
mmm I kind of like that hello Minto good luck with game love
your stream thank you thanks cold breed thanks for whole

1765
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:10,400
money you have yet to be kidding me wow that would be nice
yes all right sisal until we meet again wait how does he

1766
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:23,740
escape from the prison though there's still other doors with
other people oh well let's just not think about that part

1767
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:34,700
yes so I've now I've saved a condemned his life and helped
him escape.

1768
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:36,440
Is that really the right thing to do?

1769
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:39,040
I guess all I can do is believe in Lin at this point.

1770
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:41,360
Yeah, I don't...

1771
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:42,880
Why is there big boss?

1772
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:47,040
That's why you're the best boss.

1773
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:48,540
Great job, sneaking.

1774
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:51,420
Thank you.

1775
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:57,840
Oh, all four guards were at the cells.

1776
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:58,700
No one was upstairs.

1777
01:56:58,920 --> 01:56:59,940
Oh, that makes sense.

1778
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:03,460
Detective Jowd was painting my picture in his cell.

1779
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:04,340
He knows me.

1780
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,360
I'm sure I'll be talking to him again.

1781
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,800
Well then why doesn't Ian say something?

1782
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:12,640
Thank you, thank you!

1783
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:20,620
Real military grade NVG doesn't emit anything because it'd
be easy to detect.

1784
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:23,860
It's all passive light amplification with tech.

1785
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:26,800
I don't understand it, so it might as well be magic.

1786
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,780
Yeah, right?

1787
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:32,580
If you think about it, it's kind of like...

1788
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:39,020
It's like, yeah, it would be pointless to use it if you
could see it through like a whole trail of light, right?

1789
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:40,720
That'd be so silly.

1790
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:45,220
Uh, let's go to...

1791
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:47,980
Let's go to the guard room.

1792
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:49,480
The mortuary.

1793
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:53,300
Anybody here?

1794
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:56,760
Did you hear?

1795
01:57:57,260 --> 01:57:57,960
He escaped.

1796
01:57:58,860 --> 01:58:01,800
Yeah, we're supposed to repair this thing by the time they
catch him again.

1797
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:05,700
But I wonder why he escaped.

1798
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:08,740
But it's so cool.

1799
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:11,420
What, the light in the dark?

1800
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:12,120
I agree.

1801
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:15,440
The trail of light is so awesome.

1802
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:21,820
Splinter Cell misled a lot of people on artistic decision.

1803
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,660
Aesthetic wise, it looks great.

1804
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:26,140
Practicality?

1805
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:27,460
Not so much.

1806
01:58:28,420 --> 01:58:29,540
Reminds me of Godot.

1807
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:32,560
I mean...

1808
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:35,700
But that's like, that's like not night vision.

1809
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:43,320
And his mask emitting light is like, kind of a big thing.

1810
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:47,060
I wonder why he escaped.

1811
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:49,600
I heard Detective Jowd wanted the death penalty.

1812
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:50,780
Right.

1813
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:52,640
It's not like him to change his mind.

1814
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:57,520
Maybe on this final night of his, he just got a voice in his
head or something.

1815
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:58,700
It was me!

1816
01:58:59,060 --> 01:58:59,960
Yeah, me.

1817
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:02,180
Maybe it told him to run.

1818
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:04,100
Are they talking about me?

1819
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:07,100
What kind of a voice do you think it was?

1820
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:10,440
You know, something evil.

1821
01:59:11,660 --> 01:59:16,860
If you ever have a Minto voice in your head, something evil.

1822
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:20,280
Like a devil or a demon or something.

1823
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:22,560
Maybe a ghost.

1824
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:26,360
I picture something with a pointy head wearing sunglasses.

1825
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,240
Something like that.

1826
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:30,860
They are talking about me.

1827
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:33,320
Can they see me?

1828
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:36,300
Trick time.

1829
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:38,580
That's so silly.

1830
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:43,780
All right.

1831
01:59:44,540 --> 01:59:44,980
Guard room.

1832
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:51,960
Hey, how they know about your pointy ghost head thing?

1833
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:53,280
My stai kakushi!

1834
01:59:55,540 --> 01:59:56,160
I don't know.

1835
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:57,960
Sixth sense, I guess.

1836
01:59:59,820 --> 02:00:03,460
But Detective Jowd's until we meet again came around quicker
than I expected.

1837
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:07,520
When I got back to the guard room, fateful call came in.

1838
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:15,640
It's the panic dance.

1839
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:16,760
Hello, this is...

1840
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:16,880
Oh!

1841
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:18,220
Oh!

1842
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:19,860
Cicil, are you there?

1843
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,240
Hello?

1844
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:28,860
Oh, I'm not talking to you, officer.

1845
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:31,960
Anyway, if you're there, Cicil, come here immediately.

1846
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:34,420
I'll be waiting for you.

1847
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:36,020
If you make it in time, that is.

1848
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:38,020
Wait a minute!

1849
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:38,960
Oh my god.

1850
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:41,140
Go, go!

1851
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,200
Oh, oh, it's just so...

1852
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:49,370
Oh, wait, uh...

1853
02:00:49,370 --> 02:00:50,150
Dial, dial!

1854
02:00:50,430 --> 02:00:50,710
Oh, wait!

1855
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:55,350
I kinda wanna see what Officer Bailey has to say.

1856
02:00:57,530 --> 02:00:58,350
That call!

1857
02:00:58,750 --> 02:00:59,510
Who is it from?

1858
02:01:00,210 --> 02:01:01,070
I don't know.

1859
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:02,130
Some weird call.

1860
02:01:02,910 --> 02:01:06,430
Ah, but who will call an end to my dancing?

1861
02:01:09,230 --> 02:01:10,950
You're supposed to record it.

1862
02:01:11,510 --> 02:01:15,110
Yeah, well, once you get going like that, I'm not gonna stop
you.

1863
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:17,390
It's a contest then!

1864
02:01:18,370 --> 02:01:19,330
Which will stop first?

1865
02:01:19,570 --> 02:01:22,290
My dancing or the turning of the planet?

1866
02:01:27,490 --> 02:01:28,510
Yeah, good luck with that.

1867
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:33,390
Alrighty, external line.

1868
02:01:35,210 --> 02:01:36,810
Go to...

1869
02:01:36,810 --> 02:01:37,250
Oh.

1870
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:40,150
Go to here.

1871
02:01:41,030 --> 02:01:42,890
Wherever this mysterious place is.

1872
02:01:45,490 --> 02:01:46,130
Meow!

1873
02:01:46,870 --> 02:01:47,170
Meow!

1874
02:01:51,070 --> 02:01:51,390
Whoa.

1875
02:01:54,030 --> 02:01:59,310
On the other end of the telephone line, the scene that
greets me tells me one simple fact.

1876
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:01,050
Is Lynn dead?

1877
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:04,210
Holy cow, that was the soundtrack.

1878
02:02:06,470 --> 02:02:06,710
Oh!

1879
02:02:08,850 --> 02:02:12,270
That our great escape plan has ended in failure.

1880
02:02:14,890 --> 02:02:17,850
Never expected to see you here, Inspector Cabanella.

1881
02:02:19,230 --> 02:02:22,730
I believe that's my line, old friend.

1882
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:25,210
What were you doing here?

1883
02:02:27,310 --> 02:02:29,990
Believe that's my line too, clear.

1884
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:38,760
I came to attend your execution.

1885
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:41,300
They told me what time it was.

1886
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:46,000
Couldn't get into the chamber, so I was observing a moment
of silence here.

1887
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:50,860
And when I looked up my eyes full of tears, there you were,
baby.

1888
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:53,700
You're so adorable.

1889
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:54,640
What am I doing?

1890
02:02:55,620 --> 02:02:57,080
Why am I adorable, though?

1891
02:03:03,190 --> 02:03:05,290
It's just the way things turned out.

1892
02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:09,390
I took part in what seemed like a fun game, and here I am.

1893
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:13,130
Here's what I wish, my old friend.

1894
02:03:14,110 --> 02:03:16,630
Wish it was anybody but me who found you here.

1895
02:03:18,610 --> 02:03:19,670
What does he mean by that?

1896
02:03:20,750 --> 02:03:21,970
He is gonna shoot him?

1897
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:25,770
Because now that I've found you, man, I have to turn you in.

1898
02:03:27,350 --> 02:03:30,310
You have to stay spotlessly clean after all.

1899
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:37,020
Thanks for coming.

1900
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:40,960
I wanted to say goodbye to you because you are adorable.

1901
02:03:41,180 --> 02:03:41,920
What did I do?

1902
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:47,620
As you can see, I guess I'm not going to be much help to
you.

1903
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:50,160
What's going to happen to you?

1904
02:03:51,540 --> 02:03:55,320
Being executed tonight is just about the only thing on my
schedule, it seems.

1905
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:57,880
No, no, there must be something we can trick to.

1906
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:00,420
Executed, huh?

1907
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:02,680
Death is pretty much meaningless to me.

1908
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:05,560
Anyway, I guess we'll be seeing each other again.

1909
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:09,700
By the way, there's something I'm looking for.

1910
02:04:10,780 --> 02:04:11,320
Well, that's right.

1911
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:12,360
Your lost memory.

1912
02:04:13,820 --> 02:04:15,260
You know things I'd like to know.

1913
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:17,420
Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?

1914
02:04:18,900 --> 02:04:21,420
In return for tonight's fun little game, is that it?

1915
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:27,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, let's ask about the execution.

1916
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:28,600
Let's go down and up, down to up.

1917
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:30,260
Thank you.

1918
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:30,500
Two.

1919
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:32,840
Plus one.

1920
02:04:33,020 --> 02:04:34,440
Mint is indeed cute.

1921
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:36,160
I'm...

1922
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:36,880
Stop!

1923
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:38,320
Someone's about to die!

1924
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:39,680
We're talking about me!

1925
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:41,440
This is...

1926
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:42,920
This is not how it should be.

1927
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:47,660
Someone's about to die.

1928
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:50,060
And all you think about is anime.

1929
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:51,880
What's wrong with you?

1930
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:53,380
What's wrong with you?

1931
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:56,000
Someone's about to die and you think about anime.

1932
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:57,360
Anime girl!

1933
02:04:58,420 --> 02:05:00,800
How could you think about anime at a time like this?

1934
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:12,370
Is your execution really the right thing to do?

1935
02:05:13,250 --> 02:05:15,390
I had a fair trial, and that's what was decided.

1936
02:05:15,950 --> 02:05:16,870
No problem there.

1937
02:05:17,930 --> 02:05:22,130
But still, this is the punishment that I should receive.

1938
02:05:23,090 --> 02:05:24,730
What if Anime Girl is cute made?

1939
02:05:24,850 --> 02:05:25,810
It doesn't matter!

1940
02:05:28,750 --> 02:05:32,750
If I was about to die and want to think about how cute Mint
is too, odd but cute.

1941
02:05:37,590 --> 02:05:39,370
I am continuing this game.

1942
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:49,640
I'm continuing Forward

1943
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:57,320
In order to bring a final close to that case And put it to
rest forever

1944
02:06:01,190 --> 02:06:02,030
Kawaii, where?

1945
02:06:05,130 --> 02:06:09,370
Lin believes you're innocent She's running around right now
trying to prove it

1946
02:06:13,010 --> 02:06:14,350
Ah, you too

1947
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:39,120
You're all gross You're all gross

1948
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:44,500
For disregarding this man's death.

1949
02:06:51,190 --> 02:06:52,210
Q is justice.

1950
02:06:53,310 --> 02:06:54,390
Moe is justice.

1951
02:06:56,010 --> 02:06:56,250
Moe.

1952
02:06:57,230 --> 02:06:58,330
Moe is everything.

1953
02:06:59,450 --> 02:07:00,450
But it's not me.

1954
02:07:02,830 --> 02:07:03,130
Okay.

1955
02:07:06,310 --> 02:07:07,710
We're trash, remember?

1956
02:07:09,610 --> 02:07:11,750
I need to go get more tea soon.

1957
02:07:12,830 --> 02:07:14,450
Oh my gosh, this soundtrack is so awesome.

1958
02:07:16,830 --> 02:07:19,950
Okay, can I please continue the game?

1959
02:07:21,710 --> 02:07:24,090
Is that all you have to leave her with?

1960
02:07:24,230 --> 02:07:25,510
No problem there?

1961
02:07:27,470 --> 02:07:31,170
I was sentenced to the death penalty for killing my wife,
Alma.

1962
02:07:33,010 --> 02:07:35,310
But to me, that's not all it was for.

1963
02:07:36,530 --> 02:07:37,970
We mourn in our own ways.

1964
02:07:38,350 --> 02:07:39,130
My cats are cute.

1965
02:07:39,330 --> 02:07:40,350
You're okay, I guess.

1966
02:07:41,070 --> 02:07:42,230
Cats are always the cutest.

1967
02:07:44,510 --> 02:07:46,770
Oh my gosh, no, I'm gonna save it for the podcast.

1968
02:07:48,150 --> 02:07:49,670
Oh my god, I'm gonna save it for the podcast.

1969
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:54,700
Kawaii Coco.

1970
02:07:58,660 --> 02:07:59,400
What do you mean?

1971
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:00,700
That's not all it was for.

1972
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:02,660
Stop interrupting me!

1973
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:04,400
Okay, I'm gonna go get some water.

1974
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:07,860
Since you guys need to get this out of your system, get it
out of your system.

1975
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:08,800
I'm gonna get some water.

1976
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:12,740
You guys, I wanna read the important things going on.

1977
02:08:13,340 --> 02:08:14,380
What's wrong with you?

1978
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:16,620

I found a cute ghost, her name is Mint Phantom.

1986
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:30,860
Scatter!

1987
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:36,000
Did you wash your hands, of course?

1988
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:38,600
Why would you ask me that, Dustcall?

1989

02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:44,780
Cute ghost needs back, everyone scatter!

1991
02:11:46,180 --> 02:11:46,660
Okay.

02:11:47,180 --> 02:11:48,940
Are we ready to continue the game now?

1993
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:50,460
Are we ready to continue the game?

1994
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:51,840
Continue the story?

1995
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:54,620
Are you ready?

1996
02:12:01,540 --> 02:12:01,960
Yes.

1997
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:03,380
Okay.

1998
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:06,840
Thank you for all the super chats, you guys.

1999
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:09,940
What do you mean that's not all it was for?

2000
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:15,220
I'm talking about something that happened even before this
case.

2001
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:19,100
I stole somebody else's life.

2002
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:21,260
The Master Davina.

2003
02:12:21,420 --> 02:12:22,040
Thanks for the gifted.

2004
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:25,280
What?

2005
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:29,400
Um...

2006
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:30,460
The other murder.

2007
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:31,180
Uh-oh.

2008
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:32,520
It was 10 years ago.

2009
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,280
I'll never forget it.

2010
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:37,320
That day I saved the life of a little girl.

2011
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:40,400
And I stole away the life of a man.

2012
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:41,900
Oh, yeah.

2013
02:12:43,340 --> 02:12:45,920
A quite positive genius ghost myth.

2014
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:48,100
Da-yo!

2015
02:12:53,220 --> 02:12:54,320
10 years ago.

2016
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:54,900
The life of a little girl.

2017
02:12:54,920 --> 02:13:06,780
little girl could that little girl be Lynn she told you
about that yeah she said you were her hero now just calm

for holding her up I need to feed my cats

2020
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:27,200
10 years ago in a certain park.

2021
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:29,140
A little girl was taken hostage.

2022
02:13:29,340 --> 02:13:34,120
Okay, this is a good summary or a good reminder of what
happened before.

2023
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:35,880
I was still young then.

2024
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:38,820
Stop, Spanjima!

2025
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:40,840
No, Garlovo!

2026
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:44,580
Sekai no Ichi, Kawaii, Minto!

02:13:50,700 --> 02:13:52,620
Thank you for the akato no, thank you.

2028
02:13:53,540 --> 02:13:54,460
Thank you so much.

2029
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:59,380
But you couldn't tell me that yesterday, huh?

2030
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:00,020
When we were playing...

2031
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:02,440
when we were playing Lethal Company, huh?

2032
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:05,400
Yesterday I did a Patreon stream.

2033
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:08,380
And we played Lethal Company.

2034
02:14:16,840 --> 02:14:18,060
Do you want me to?

2035
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:18,820
I will next time.

2036
02:14:18,940 --> 02:14:19,180
No!

2037
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:21,640
Not at all.

2038
02:14:23,220 --> 02:14:24,740
I was still young then.

2039
02:14:24,940 --> 02:14:26,120
I didn't have any self-control.

2040
02:14:26,860 --> 02:14:27,660
Sounds like you guys.

2041
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:30,420
I remember asking myself at the time.

2042
02:14:30,820 --> 02:14:32,780
Jowd, are you going to shoot this guy?

2043
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:35,220
And this is what I answered.

2044
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:38,320
Yeah, I'm gonna shoot that guy.

2045
02:14:44,100 --> 02:14:46,200
I was too starstruck.

2046
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:55,080
It's okay, if you're part of the Patreon, the two tiers,
we'll do another one.

2047
02:14:56,280 --> 02:14:58,460
Another one, so if you missed out, don't worry.

2048
02:14:59,220 --> 02:15:03,160
My hand was shaking a little, if my hand slipped, the man
might die.

2049
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:05,880
even the little hostage girl was in danger

2050
02:15:10,580 --> 02:15:19,340
nevertheless that was my answer yeah I'm going to shoot and
the

2051
02:15:25,130 --> 02:15:36,930
man died I took his life yeah it's pretty messed up Lynn was
never told the outcome she was so young at the time I don't

2052
02:15:36,930 --> 02:15:41,230
deserve to be called a hero deserve is execution.

2053
02:15:43,390 --> 02:15:45,410
Aw, he has all that guilt.

2054
02:15:45,970 --> 02:15:47,770
But he was holding a little girl hostage.

2055
02:15:48,030 --> 02:15:48,670
I'm sorry, what?

2056
02:15:51,250 --> 02:15:53,330
So anyway, I started blasting.

2057
02:15:54,190 --> 02:15:55,790
That man pointing the gun at you right now.

2058
02:15:56,230 --> 02:15:57,570
They say he's your good friend.

2059
02:15:57,830 --> 02:15:58,890
Why is good friend?

2060
02:15:59,790 --> 02:16:00,610
In quotes.

2061
02:16:02,130 --> 02:16:05,490
And he's your good friend.

2062
02:16:06,770 --> 02:16:06,990
Yeah.

2063
02:16:09,050 --> 02:16:10,090
Is your...

2064
02:16:11,190 --> 02:16:13,830
Is your... good friend!

2065
02:16:14,710 --> 02:16:16,710
History would say they were roommates.

2066
02:16:19,570 --> 02:16:20,090
We were.

2067
02:16:20,610 --> 02:16:22,530
We were in the detective division together.

2068
02:16:24,910 --> 02:16:26,070
That was a long time ago.

2069
02:16:26,590 --> 02:16:28,250
I think we're gonna have to kill this guy.

2070
02:16:31,110 --> 02:16:33,150
Platypus, thanks for the month, thank you!

2071
02:16:34,490 --> 02:16:36,890
Now he's the head of the special investigation unit.

2072
02:16:37,290 --> 02:16:38,330
The top of the elite.

2073
02:16:38,950 --> 02:16:41,510
Getting ahead is the only thing he thinks about now.

2074
02:16:43,370 --> 02:16:46,370
And that white coat of his is the symbol of his
determination.

2075
02:16:47,430 --> 02:16:48,250
His white coat?

2076
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:53,370
For somebody looking to get promoted to the top, what's the
one thing they're afraid of most?

2077
02:17:07,850 --> 02:17:08,810
Getting dirty.

2078
02:17:10,270 --> 02:17:10,750
Ghosts?

2079
02:17:11,150 --> 02:17:11,630
Ghosts?

2080
02:17:11,830 --> 02:17:13,830
A blot on their record, of course.

2081
02:17:14,890 --> 02:17:17,350
Like a stain on a pure white coat.

2082
02:17:18,470 --> 02:17:20,470
Who would promote a man with a coat covered in sand?

2083
02:17:20,490 --> 02:17:20,930
stains.

2084
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:25,090
If it was me, I'd go with a black coat that didn't show the
stains.

2085
02:17:26,230 --> 02:17:28,830
Oh, then why don't you change your red coat, huh?

2086
02:17:29,930 --> 02:17:31,710
The world is full of excellent candidates.

2087
02:17:32,250 --> 02:17:34,110
Even one mistake could be the end of a career.

2088
02:17:35,190 --> 02:17:36,610
But everyone makes mistakes, right?

2089
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:41,530
Nevertheless, Cabanela has chosen the path of the white
coat.

2090
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:55,450
And he'd do anything, anything at all to hide his shadows oh
so it's not so clean after all oh my gosh take the coat take

2091
02:17:55,450 --> 02:18:09,340
a UV light to that coat take a UV light to that coat and see
what it shows huh like send his good friend to the gallows

2092
02:18:09,340 --> 02:18:24,360
that's because oh because that's the right thing to do I'm a
condemned criminal after all covered in ectoplasm no I was

2093
02:18:24,360 --> 02:18:28,500
thinking the blood What were you guys thinking?

2094
02:18:30,140 --> 02:18:31,220
I was thinking of blood.

2095
02:18:32,060 --> 02:18:34,180
That you, like, use the solution.

2096
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:36,220
And then it shows in the UV light.

2097
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:47,020
Ectoplasm.

2098
02:18:47,560 --> 02:18:51,220
I don't think ectoplasm would show in a UV light.

2099
02:18:52,020 --> 02:18:52,240
Oh, wait.

2100
02:18:57,020 --> 02:18:58,280
Wait, yes, it does.

2101
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:10,340
Uh-oh.

2102
02:19:10,580 --> 02:19:11,520
I think I'm in trouble.

2103
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:13,840
Uh-oh.

2104
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:15,260
Uh-oh.

2105
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:18,000
Uh-oh!

2106
02:19:18,500 --> 02:19:19,600
I think...

2107
02:19:23,150 --> 02:19:26,490
And that's why he has that gun pointed at me right now.

2108
02:19:27,850 --> 02:19:29,010
Alright, let's ask about ourselves.

2109
02:19:29,250 --> 02:19:30,710
The one that I've been the most curious about.

2110
02:19:31,430 --> 02:19:32,370
I saw it, you know.

2111
02:19:32,950 --> 02:19:35,170
That picture you were painting in your cell tonight.

2112
02:19:35,950 --> 02:19:36,690
That was me.

2113
02:19:37,650 --> 02:19:39,230
Which means you must know me.

2114
02:19:41,190 --> 02:19:42,570
I'm very sorry, but...

2115
02:19:43,350 --> 02:19:45,170
I can't talk to you about that now.

2116
02:19:45,730 --> 02:19:46,010
What?

2117
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:46,550
Why not?

2118
02:19:47,470 --> 02:19:47,810
What?

2119
02:19:49,170 --> 02:19:51,010
Maybe I really am, Sissel.

2120
02:19:52,650 --> 02:19:54,590
Because I loved you.

2121
02:19:54,990 --> 02:19:56,930
I don't know your true face.

2122
02:19:58,050 --> 02:19:59,190
Oh my gosh, my glasses.

2123
02:19:59,470 --> 02:20:00,210
Oh, I'm one of those.

2124
02:20:00,290 --> 02:20:01,470
I don't take off my glasses.

2125
02:20:02,690 --> 02:20:03,870
My true face.

2126
02:20:04,690 --> 02:20:05,350
I'm a detective.

2127
02:20:05,810 --> 02:20:07,570
I can only talk about what I'm sure of.

2128
02:20:09,510 --> 02:20:12,550
However, I can give you one lead at least.

2129
02:20:12,970 --> 02:20:13,770
One month.

2130
02:20:13,910 --> 02:20:15,190
Yeah, roaring, John.

2131
02:20:15,290 --> 02:20:15,990
Thank you.

2132
02:20:17,590 --> 02:20:18,430
A lead.

2133
02:20:18,570 --> 02:20:19,690
What is it?

2134
02:20:20,330 --> 02:20:22,730
A long time ago, I gave Lin something to hold on to me.

2135
02:20:23,110 --> 02:20:23,670
On to for me!

2136
02:20:23,870 --> 02:20:24,650
The music box!

2137
02:20:25,010 --> 02:20:25,790
It was a music box!

2138
02:20:25,890 --> 02:20:26,410
Yes, yes, yes.

2139
02:20:27,390 --> 02:20:30,550
If you ever come across it, I advise you to open it.

2140
02:20:31,070 --> 02:20:32,450
It might jog your memory.

2141
02:20:33,570 --> 02:20:35,590
That wooden box I found in Lin's apartment!

2142
02:20:36,670 --> 02:20:38,530
And that's the only help I can give you right now.

2143
02:20:38,730 --> 02:20:40,250
Oh my god, we were right next to it.

2144
02:20:40,630 --> 02:20:41,610
The whole time.

2145
02:20:42,810 --> 02:20:46,230
Are we about to watch him get dead?

2146
02:20:48,570 --> 02:20:59,570
go my arms are getting tired you got it baby time for the
big show of hauling you in oh he's not gonna shoot don't

2147
02:20:59,570 --> 02:21:12,230
shoot oh that's right just let me make one last phone call
that's a big favor to ask so casually my old friend tell you

2148
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:20,030
what I'll do I'll pretend I'm not watching I'll be
listening, though.

2149
02:21:20,470 --> 02:21:21,990
On that, you can rely.

2150
02:21:23,550 --> 02:21:26,630
Okay, why does the paints change on his jacket like that?

2151
02:21:27,390 --> 02:21:29,290
Cicel, you've got your own path to follow.

2152
02:21:29,630 --> 02:21:30,510
You'd better hurry.

2153
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:32,170
My own path.

2154
02:21:33,150 --> 02:21:36,370
Flynn is at the Justice Minister's office right now, right?

2155
02:21:36,930 --> 02:21:40,170
It might not be a bad idea to say my final farewell to him,
too.

2156
02:21:41,190 --> 02:21:41,890
Hey, Poop-Popee.

2157
02:21:42,850 --> 02:21:43,390
Moshe, Moshe.

2158
02:21:46,630 --> 02:21:47,070
Hello?

2159
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:48,290
Everything's fine here!

2160
02:21:48,570 --> 02:21:49,290
Uh-oh.

2161
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:50,230
Lynn?

2162
02:21:51,490 --> 02:21:51,970
Uh.

2163
02:21:53,070 --> 02:21:54,630
Is this the chicken kitchen?

2164
02:21:55,070 --> 02:21:56,650
I'd like to request a delivery.

2165
02:21:57,990 --> 02:22:00,650
Um, the chicken kitchen is next door.

2166
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:05,020
Aye, good day to you, sir.

2167
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:06,080
Good day to you.

2168
02:22:07,100 --> 02:22:07,400
Oh.

2169
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:08,340
Psh.

2170
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:11,740
All right.

2171
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:15,800
Sounds like she's in some kind of trouble.

2172
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:17,780
It does, doesn't it?

2173
02:22:18,420 --> 02:22:19,920
Go help her out, would you, Sissel?

2174
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:32,970
Sorry to keep Sorry to keep you waiting, inspector Ready to
go I bet inspector Cabanella is probably like Oh my gosh He

2175
02:22:32,970 --> 02:22:35,950
really lost his mind in the jail cell Now he's talking to
ghosts

2176
02:22:42,800 --> 02:22:53,420
Oh Oh before I forget Don't shoot Don't shoot Don't shoot Oh
I have a little something for you Oh

2177
02:22:57,180 --> 02:22:57,700
What?

2178
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:00,160
Are you...

2179
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:00,580
What?

2180
02:23:01,540 --> 02:23:01,860
Are you...

2181
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:03,020
Are you gonna hypnotize me?

2182
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:04,180
What's going on?

2183
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:06,940
Just like my Dogen's.

2184
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:09,320
A present, if you will.

2185
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:11,700
There's nothing else like it, baby.

2186
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,480
If there's nothing else like it, don't throw it.

2187
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:17,080
Oh.

2188
02:23:18,940 --> 02:23:19,680
What's this?

2189
02:23:19,740 --> 02:23:20,480
A pocket watch?

2190
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:24,540
Considering my situation, it's the last thing in the world I
need right now.

2191
02:23:25,100 --> 02:23:26,340
He needs more time.

2192
02:23:26,500 --> 02:23:27,620
He gave you more time.

2193
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:30,280
Forgive me, man.

2194
02:23:30,700 --> 02:23:33,340
Let's just say I'm no good at choosing presents.

2195
02:23:39,770 --> 02:23:40,510
This is it, Sissel.

2196
02:23:41,550 --> 02:23:43,230
Let me just leave you with one thing.

2197
02:23:44,350 --> 02:23:45,690
Don't trust other people's memories.

2198
02:23:46,510 --> 02:23:48,530
Look for what you seek with your own eyes.

2199
02:23:49,570 --> 02:23:50,910
I'll remember that.

2200
02:23:51,550 --> 02:23:51,830
Hmm.

2201
02:23:52,810 --> 02:23:54,970
Actually, people's memories are very...

2202
02:23:56,150 --> 02:23:57,770
Are very unreliable.

2203
02:24:00,870 --> 02:24:03,870
Witness testimony is not great all the time.

2204
02:24:06,010 --> 02:24:06,830
They're gone.

2205
02:24:07,390 --> 02:24:08,350
There's nothing left here.

2206
02:24:08,730 --> 02:24:09,130
No hope.

2207
02:24:09,590 --> 02:24:10,790
No cores either.

2208
02:24:13,070 --> 02:24:13,290
Okay.

2209
02:24:14,710 --> 02:24:16,790
Without any cores, I can't follow after them.

2210
02:24:17,250 --> 02:24:18,550
This is the end of my adventure.

2211
02:24:19,250 --> 02:24:21,870
I feel pretty dejected, but I guess I'd better go find Lynn.

2212
02:24:25,130 --> 02:24:27,390
Fake memories are a thing, a scary thing.

2213
02:24:27,510 --> 02:24:28,370
Yeah, I can imagine.

2214
02:24:35,380 --> 02:24:48,540
parents memories however are rock solid holy hell is this
ace attorney yes thanks for the super chat evan i'll follow

2215
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:54,760
the path detective jowd pointed out to me the path to the
justice minister's office where lynn went to try and stop

2216
02:24:54,760 --> 02:25:02,300
the execution i don't remember saying this before but Stop.

2217
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:04,980
Trava!

2218
02:25:05,180 --> 02:25:06,540
Is that what the song is called?

2219
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:07,360
Oh my god.

2220
02:25:08,320 --> 02:25:10,800
Let's save and keep going.

2221
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:15,160
1141pm.

2222
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:15,880
It's so late.

2223
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:17,720
Why would the Justice Minister still be there?

2224
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:25,920
Now that my assignment to stop the execution has ended in
such an unsatisfactory way, I decided to go see Lin at the

2225
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:27,040
Justice Minister's office.

2226
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:30,680
Oh yeah, it's here.

2227
02:25:30,840 --> 02:25:31,300
I forgot.

2228
02:25:33,480 --> 02:25:36,940
Detective Jiao's story about this other murder weighs on me
heavily.

2229
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:38,680
Should I tell Lynn about it?

2230
02:25:39,020 --> 02:25:39,960
I just don't know.

2231
02:25:40,340 --> 02:25:41,960
He's the attorney of the Phantom Bay.

2232
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,280
Why are there pills on the ground?

2233
02:25:50,020 --> 02:25:50,780
What is she doing?

2234
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:52,720
Oh, she is...

2235
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:54,060
This time, Lynn isn't dead.

2236
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:54,680
Wow!

2237
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:59,680
But the atmosphere makes me think it might be too soon to
count my blessings just yet.

2238
02:26:08,100 --> 02:26:10,340
I'm glad Lynn isn't dead.

2239
02:26:10,820 --> 02:26:13,200
Oh man, Lynn dead counter, zero.

2240
02:26:14,480 --> 02:26:15,520
What in the world is she doing?

2241
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:19,020
Help step ghost, I'm stuck.

2242
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:21,500
Then again, do I really want to know?

2243
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:25,400
What is she doing?

2244
02:26:35,210 --> 02:26:36,330
Sorry, I was drinking.

2245
02:26:36,430 --> 02:26:37,690
I almost spit at my tea!

2246
02:26:39,610 --> 02:26:44,730
Oh my god, I almost spit out my tea!

2247
02:26:46,510 --> 02:26:46,910
Uh...

2248
02:26:47,330 --> 02:26:47,730
Lids?

2249
02:26:49,870 --> 02:26:51,370
What kind of greeting is that?

2250
02:26:51,770 --> 02:26:53,910
I mean, I know I'm a ghost and everything, but...

2251
02:26:53,910 --> 02:26:55,330
Well, and how did it go?

2252
02:26:55,630 --> 02:26:56,810
Was Detective Jowd still alive?

2253
02:26:57,790 --> 02:26:58,190
Um...

2254
02:26:58,190 --> 02:27:00,370
He'd already been executed by the time I got there.

2255
02:27:00,690 --> 02:27:02,870
I did manage to save him, but...

2256
02:27:02,870 --> 02:27:03,290
You did?

2257
02:27:03,470 --> 02:27:04,270
Oh, I'm so glad.

2258
02:27:04,950 --> 02:27:05,810
Wait, wait a minute.

2259
02:27:06,030 --> 02:27:06,610
Did you say but?

2260
02:27:07,570 --> 02:27:08,650
It's 3.30 a.m.

2261
02:27:08,650 --> 02:27:09,750
Do I grab an ice cream?

2262
02:27:10,030 --> 02:27:10,430
Thanks.

2263
02:27:12,070 --> 02:27:13,550
Yeah, I think so.

2264
02:27:14,850 --> 02:27:16,310
I love late night ice cream.

2265
02:27:16,610 --> 02:27:18,110
What kind of ice cream are you gonna get though?

2266
02:27:18,950 --> 02:27:19,610
Rip tea.

2267
02:27:19,830 --> 02:27:20,770
No, I drank it.

2268
02:27:21,530 --> 02:27:21,790
Luckily.

2269
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:26,690
I told Lynn about my adventure at the prison.

2270
02:27:27,590 --> 02:27:29,170
About that other murder though.

2271
02:27:30,130 --> 02:27:31,590
I couldn't bring myself to tell her.

2272
02:27:32,850 --> 02:27:42,170
At least, you know, as much as I wasn't a huge fan of the
last thing where we had to do the sneaking mission, I

2273
02:27:42,170 --> 02:27:48,330
appreciate the game trying out other methods of, you know,
having us use the ghost trick.

2274
02:27:48,770 --> 02:27:49,650
So I think that's kind of fun.

2275
02:27:55,810 --> 02:27:57,690
Spectre Cabanela arrested Detective Jowd?

2276
02:27:58,550 --> 02:27:59,770
I can't believe it!

2277
02:28:02,010 --> 02:28:02,630
Cinder K!

2278
02:28:02,970 --> 02:28:03,910
Thank you for the time you did!

2279
02:28:05,550 --> 02:28:08,110
Yeah, a little breakup in design is cool once in a while.

2280
02:28:08,410 --> 02:28:09,650
Yeah, and it wasn't so long.

2281
02:28:11,310 --> 02:28:13,630
She seems to have some y'all by reading preferences.

2282
02:28:15,310 --> 02:28:17,410
My favorite ice cream is mint cookie crumble.

2283
02:28:17,550 --> 02:28:17,870
Ooh!

2284
02:28:20,070 --> 02:28:21,450
Ah, you're making me hungry.

2285
02:28:23,650 --> 02:28:24,870
I feel the same way.

2286
02:28:25,330 --> 02:28:28,510
I can't believe that, whatever, wherever I go, somebody is
always dead.

2287
02:28:28,950 --> 02:28:30,630
Either you or someone else.

2288
02:28:31,510 --> 02:28:32,350
Sorry about that.

2289
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:34,930
So who is that lying on the floor there?

2290
02:28:35,570 --> 02:28:36,550
Oh, you noticed him, did you?

2291
02:28:36,990 --> 02:28:39,370
That's just the, that's the justice minister.

2292
02:28:39,970 --> 02:28:42,610
The man who signed the order to carry out Detective Zhao's
execution?

2293
02:28:43,390 --> 02:28:44,890
Uh, he was already dead when I got here.

2294
02:28:45,770 --> 02:28:57,310
shouldn't you have called for help in that case I guess so
Lynn Lynn but I I'm wanted remember for murder I was hoping

2295
02:28:57,310 --> 02:29:11,030
we could save him without me getting caught we eh oh boy the
guy with the marriage troubles I think so oops my bad let's

2296
02:29:11,030 --> 02:29:17,350
talk to him let's see what he's got to say Hey, can he hear
me?

2297
02:29:18,170 --> 02:29:18,750
Are you awake?

2298
02:29:19,970 --> 02:29:21,930
He's dead, but he still seems to be unconscious.

2299
02:29:23,190 --> 02:29:24,190
Could you rescue him now?

2300
02:29:24,570 --> 02:29:25,430
While he's still unconscious?

2301
02:29:26,470 --> 02:29:30,810
Instead of talking to him, I bet it'll be faster to see,
just to see for yourself what really happened.

2302
02:29:31,870 --> 02:29:32,710
Yeah, I bet you're right.

2303
02:29:33,590 --> 02:29:36,070
Back we go then, to four minutes before his death.

2304
02:29:36,850 --> 02:29:37,030
Wet.

2305
02:29:39,230 --> 02:29:40,030
Rewind time.

2306
02:29:40,130 --> 02:29:40,330
Well done.

2307
02:29:40,590 --> 02:29:42,590
I have some, uh...

2308
02:29:42,590 --> 02:29:44,310
Uh, some dried mango.

2309
02:29:45,790 --> 02:29:47,850
I'm gonna eat it.

2310
02:29:48,130 --> 02:29:50,370
Dried mango, 1131.

2311
02:29:52,630 --> 02:29:55,330
Yeah, this is the guy with the marriage problems.

2312
02:29:57,630 --> 02:29:58,790
What's he doing, right?

2313
02:29:58,970 --> 02:30:00,630
Oh, he's a jumpy bunch.

2314
02:30:01,130 --> 02:30:01,410
Emma!

2315
02:30:03,670 --> 02:30:04,210
Not Emma.

2316
02:30:04,330 --> 02:30:05,590
Oh, excuse me.

2317
02:30:08,410 --> 02:30:09,030
What?

2318
02:30:14,070 --> 02:30:15,310
All right.

2319
02:30:16,770 --> 02:30:18,100
Don't do as you say.

2320
02:30:26,190 --> 02:30:28,070
Look, it's terrible.

2321
02:30:35,690 --> 02:30:36,990
Mint mango.

2322
02:30:42,230 --> 02:30:43,810
What's going on?

2323
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:45,730
Why doesn't she answer?

2324
02:30:58,650 --> 02:30:59,590
Um...

2325
02:30:59,590 --> 02:31:01,850
Is he gonna die from heartbreak?

2326
02:31:05,550 --> 02:31:05,830
Oh?

2327
02:31:06,830 --> 02:31:07,030
Oh

2328
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:14,580
my god, medicine!

2329
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:21,960
That explains the pills over there.

2330
02:31:22,550 --> 02:31:23,810
Pills here.

2331
02:31:26,070 --> 02:31:27,430
Oh, water!

2332
02:31:29,030 --> 02:31:30,430
Oh my god, this poor guy!

2333
02:31:31,150 --> 02:31:32,370
This is so sad!

2334
02:31:39,220 --> 02:31:39,960
Fucks!

2335
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:40,900
Die!

2336
02:31:47,310 --> 02:31:50,540
Something about a serious flashback with a somber music?

2337
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:54,180
and then SpongeBob saying, Arigato, Arigato, Chew is sending
me.

2338
02:31:55,020 --> 02:31:56,680
Such a foolish man.

2339
02:31:57,380 --> 02:31:58,420
Oh, you woke up.

2340
02:31:59,180 --> 02:32:01,120
He's a contradiction.

2341
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:03,040
Contradiction.

2342
02:32:04,480 --> 02:32:07,660
The more we search for the truth, the further into a dilemma
we fall.

2343
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:11,680
The world of men is steeped in contradictions.

2344
02:32:12,160 --> 02:32:14,480
If we choose this, we can't have that.

2345
02:32:15,080 --> 02:32:19,940
If a man tries to have his medicine bottle and water
pitcher, too, he loses both.

2346
02:32:21,220 --> 02:32:22,020
Thank you.

2347
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:26,660
What will we find if we put your maid cafe under UV lights
mint?

2348
02:32:26,940 --> 02:32:27,720
Care to explain?

2349
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:30,540
I don't know.

2350
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:31,560
I mean...

2351
02:32:33,660 --> 02:32:34,580
I'm a ghost.

2352
02:32:34,820 --> 02:32:38,120
If I walk around, ectoplasm kind of gets places.

2353
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:39,640
It's not my fault.

2354
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:41,540
It's just how it is.

2355
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:43,340
It's like I'm like a snail.

2356
02:32:46,540 --> 02:32:47,360
I don't know.

2357
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:50,420
To me, it looks like you could have had both of those things
just now.

2358
02:32:51,440 --> 02:32:52,820
He didn't know the...

2359
02:32:52,820 --> 02:32:55,000
He didn't know the truth about the world.

2360
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:56,940
That's why he died.

2361
02:32:57,460 --> 02:32:58,720
Such a foolish man.

2362
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:02,400
Or maybe I should say a pathetic man.

2363
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:03,760
That's more...

2364
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:05,680
That's the more fitting word.

2365
02:33:06,740 --> 02:33:08,440
I don't think this guy gets it yet.

2366
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:12,400
That the foolish and pathetic man is him.

2367
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:15,080
Is that why they call...

2368
02:33:15,080 --> 02:33:17,040
Is that what they call a contradiction?

2369
02:33:18,020 --> 02:33:19,200
By the way, what's your name?

2370
02:33:20,480 --> 02:33:23,500
Uh, just call me a sicker of truth.

2371
02:33:24,800 --> 02:33:25,960
Side-step that one, didn't he?

2372
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:31,440
Uh, riparone.

2373
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:35,520
This one should be kind of quick, though, right?

2374
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:37,780
Like, we...

2375
02:33:39,640 --> 02:33:40,040
Uh...

2376
02:33:40,540 --> 02:33:42,540
No need to think this one too hard about this one.

2377
02:33:42,700 --> 02:33:44,320
All I have to do is get him and his medicine to him.

2378
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:44,960
Pretty simple.

2379
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:46,940
But there's one more thing that concerns me.

2380
02:33:47,580 --> 02:33:50,540
What was that telephone call the Justice Minister got all
about?

2381
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:51,920
Oh, yes, true, true.

2382
02:33:52,400 --> 02:33:56,340
It was right after that, his health took an instant
downturn.

2383
02:33:57,460 --> 02:34:00,580
I've never seen such a foolish, pathetic, and strange man.

2384
02:34:03,380 --> 02:34:05,140
I think you'd better stop there.

2385
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:08,060
Okay, well, uh...

2386
02:34:08,060 --> 02:34:09,660
His body below is so creepy.

2387
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:10,780
Emma!

2388
02:34:11,640 --> 02:34:12,320
Could it be?

2389
02:34:13,400 --> 02:34:14,280
Excuse me.

2390
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:15,780
Wait, who's on the other line?

2391
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:16,520
Oh.

2392
02:34:17,060 --> 02:34:17,560
Oh!

2393
02:34:19,360 --> 02:34:20,280
Oh, my.

2394
02:34:22,340 --> 02:34:24,840
forgive me for calling so late mr.

2395
02:34:25,320 --> 02:34:35,620
minister oh girl you can call me as late as you want who is
this how did you get this number we have your daughter oh

2396
02:34:37,140 --> 02:34:51,400

tutor call you at this hour no oh say it one more time we

2397
02:34:51,400 --> 02:34:52,960
have your daughter.

2398
02:34:53,580 --> 02:34:53,800
Nani!

2399
02:34:55,920 --> 02:34:58,260
My daughter, is she alright?

2400
02:34:58,700 --> 02:34:59,580
Tell me she's alright.

2401
02:35:00,740 --> 02:35:01,980
Here for yourself.

2402
02:35:03,980 --> 02:35:05,240
Papa, help!

2403
02:35:06,320 --> 02:35:07,980
I'm gonna be killed!

2404
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:10,940
Oh my god, they turned her into a candle!

2405
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:12,840
What do you want?

2406
02:35:12,980 --> 02:35:14,220
What are your demands?

2407
02:35:14,900 --> 02:35:18,040
I believe we already made our demand known the other day.

2408
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:22,680
Oh, so it was you.

2409
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:26,220
And have you complied?

2410
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:28,320
Has the execution...

2411
02:35:28,320 --> 02:35:31,900
Why do they want him dead?

2412
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:34,880
Has the execution been carried out?

2413
02:35:35,480 --> 02:35:37,440
I didn't do it because of your demand.

2414
02:35:37,860 --> 02:35:40,260
I did it because that's my job.

2415
02:35:41,900 --> 02:35:43,400
Yes, yes, of course.

2416
02:35:44,400 --> 02:35:47,220
They should be contacting me any minute now with the
confirmation.

2417
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:49,160
There's no need for this kidnapping.

2418
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:51,600
We're very thorough.

2419
02:35:52,060 --> 02:35:53,820
You'd do well to remember that.

2420
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:57,680
A female ghost never talk about having a snail trail.

2421
02:35:58,540 --> 02:35:59,760
Because it's embarrassing, okay?

2422
02:36:00,200 --> 02:36:01,000
I keep it real.

2423
02:36:04,540 --> 02:36:09,240
And of course it goes without saying, we're watching you.

2424
02:36:10,440 --> 02:36:14,640
If this information leaves that room, you'll never see your
daughter again.

2425
02:36:15,260 --> 02:36:16,840
I trust you understand that.

2426
02:36:17,580 --> 02:36:19,300
She can keep my daughter.

2427
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:23,140
Don't tell the police.

2428
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:24,240
Is that it?

2429
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:28,360
All you have to do is your job.

2430
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:29,880
All right.

2431
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:31,140
I'll do as you say.

2432
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:33,780
I'll make sure the execution is carried out tonight.

2433
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:35,240
You have my word.

2434
02:36:35,940 --> 02:36:36,360
Uh-oh.

2435
02:36:37,980 --> 02:36:38,940
Uh-oh.

2436
02:36:40,120 --> 02:36:42,900
Wait, but if we go there...

2437
02:36:42,900 --> 02:36:45,220
If we go there, he's gonna die.

2438
02:36:46,220 --> 02:36:46,680
Oh well.

2439
02:36:48,140 --> 02:36:50,100
Let's go see the sexy lady.

2440
02:36:52,660 --> 02:36:55,640
Mama Smurf, I'm coming for you!

2441
02:36:58,040 --> 02:37:01,220
So it was a recording of the little girl?

2442
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:04,460
We're here.

2443
02:37:09,390 --> 02:37:12,490
Apparently the police in this country aren't so easily
fooled.

2444
02:37:13,210 --> 02:37:15,890
I had no idea a word of tonight's deal had leaked.

2445
02:37:20,750 --> 02:37:21,410
Papahou!

2446
02:37:23,570 --> 02:37:25,430
I'm gonna be killed!

2447
02:37:28,430 --> 02:37:32,550
Luckily, I managed to arrange it so that the Justice
Minister could hear her voice.

2448
02:37:34,210 --> 02:37:36,670
But what's taking the good so long to arrive?

2449
02:37:37,190 --> 02:37:38,630
I'm starting to get concerned.

2450
02:37:41,410 --> 02:37:42,190
Oh my gosh.

2451
02:37:42,650 --> 02:37:44,810
You're so sexy when you're concerned.

2452
02:37:46,350 --> 02:37:47,490
Wait, time is passing.

2453
02:37:48,790 --> 02:37:50,570
Oh, yeah, because he's dead.

2454
02:37:50,690 --> 02:37:52,930
Wait, I don't think I can go back.

2455
02:37:55,490 --> 02:38:07,110
I can't I can't go back I can't use the phone right now Like
I said All women are like traps That and this Are hardly

2456
02:38:07,110 --> 02:38:12,770
related But in the past Yep, yep, yep, I could all Oops

2457
02:38:17,970 --> 02:38:28,090
This looks so similar To the room that was In that guy's
basement In the junkyard Uh I think we're just gonna die

2458
02:38:28,090 --> 02:38:28,370
here.

2459
02:38:29,510 --> 02:38:30,230
Uh-oh.

2460
02:38:30,710 --> 02:38:33,070
This woman doesn't show any signs of moving from a spot.

2461
02:38:33,650 --> 02:38:35,310
And I can't use the telephone line either.

2462
02:38:36,210 --> 02:38:37,270
Looks like I fell into a trap.

2463
02:38:38,030 --> 02:38:39,530
No, I knew what I was doing.

2464
02:38:40,070 --> 02:38:42,590
Oh, all women are like traps.

2465
02:38:43,210 --> 02:38:44,270
Some are sweet traps.

2466
02:38:44,550 --> 02:38:45,210
Others are bitter.

2467
02:38:45,590 --> 02:38:46,930
Don't you understand that?

2468
02:38:48,270 --> 02:38:48,770
Okay.

2469
02:38:49,670 --> 02:38:52,350
I think I'd better rethink things here.

2470
02:38:54,890 --> 02:38:56,730
She's like really just...

2471
02:38:56,750 --> 02:38:58,670
She's like a statue.

2472
02:38:59,030 --> 02:39:00,910
She's just really thinking right there.

2473
02:39:01,130 --> 02:39:01,750
She's just really...

2474
02:39:04,450 --> 02:39:07,990
She's just... She's just... She's just standing there.

2475
02:39:08,690 --> 02:39:13,190
She's really like meditating so deeply.

2476
02:39:13,630 --> 02:39:14,430
Oh, three.

2477
02:39:18,050 --> 02:39:19,730
You can hit R to reset.

2478
02:39:19,970 --> 02:39:21,790
Yeah, but don't you want to spend more time with her?

2479
02:39:24,210 --> 02:39:24,810
I

2480
02:39:28,190 --> 02:39:29,290
think he's dead.

2481
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:38,620
It's so anticlimactic just sitting here.

2482
02:39:40,960 --> 02:39:43,320
It's so anticlimactic just sitting here.

2483
02:39:43,660 --> 02:39:44,960
You don't see anything.

2484
02:39:46,360 --> 02:39:47,800
Okay, a mysterious kidnapping, eh?

2485
02:39:48,120 --> 02:39:49,740
I'd like to find out more about it.

2486
02:39:50,460 --> 02:39:52,520
But right now I have another problem to solve first.

2487
02:39:53,860 --> 02:39:55,760
Cause as little trouble for others as possible.

2488
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:57,900
Now that's a rule to live by.

2489
02:39:58,580 --> 02:39:59,200
Never mind that.

2490
02:39:59,340 --> 02:40:00,040
Let's start over.

2491
02:40:01,340 --> 02:40:02,580
Okay, from the beginning.

2492
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:11,360
All righty.

2493
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:13,600
Trick time.

2494
02:40:18,170 --> 02:40:18,570
Oh,

2495
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:23,000
excuse me.

2496
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:27,020
And then we can skip through all of this.

2497
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:32,400
Baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa.

2498
02:40:32,700 --> 02:40:33,360
Baa, baa, baa, baa, baa.

2499
02:40:33,380 --> 02:40:34,960
And papa, I mean papa, help.

2500
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:36,340
I'm gonna be killed.

2501
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:37,820
Baa, baa, baa, baa, baa.

2502
02:40:38,900 --> 02:40:40,200
Baa, baa, baa, baa.

2503
02:40:40,920 --> 02:40:42,020
Bala la la la la la.

2504
02:40:46,920 --> 02:40:48,040
Okay, good.

2505
02:40:48,660 --> 02:40:49,900
Stay here.

2506
02:40:57,840 --> 02:40:58,000
No.

2507
02:41:00,820 --> 02:41:02,600
This is terrible.

2508
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:03,900
The kidnapping, eh?

2509
02:41:04,380 --> 02:41:06,500
Once again, I'm not sure I know what the word means.

2510
02:41:07,100 --> 02:41:10,240
It's apparently the cause of the minister's attack.

2511
02:41:10,560 --> 02:41:12,380
I mean, it's in the name, Sissel.

2512
02:41:13,800 --> 02:41:15,300
They napped a kid.

2513
02:41:16,540 --> 02:41:18,180
I think it's in the name.

2514
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:20,660
Oh, he's slow.

2515
02:41:24,040 --> 02:41:25,740
Such a useless man.

2516
02:41:26,260 --> 02:41:26,380
Huh?

2517
02:41:27,100 --> 02:41:29,600
A useless man caught up in a useless case.

2518
02:41:30,060 --> 02:41:31,580
Why doesn't he understand that?

2519
02:41:33,480 --> 02:41:35,640
Anyway, we only have four minutes.

2520
02:41:36,660 --> 02:41:38,860
I'd better do something about that medicine.

2521
02:41:40,440 --> 02:41:41,140
Let's see.

2522
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:44,400
Wait, what is he doing now?

2523
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:45,220
Who is he talking to?

2524
02:41:45,540 --> 02:41:46,900
I have to call my wife.

2525
02:41:47,240 --> 02:41:48,280
I have to see if it's true.

2526
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:50,600
Maybe they called the wrong person.

2527
02:41:51,560 --> 02:41:53,280
This minister doesn't accept the truth easily.

2528
02:41:53,460 --> 02:41:54,920
Oh, that's right she didn't pick up.

2529
02:41:55,260 --> 02:41:56,720
He's morally bankrupt.

2530
02:41:57,720 --> 02:42:00,360
Is putting a kid down for a nap a crime?

2531
02:42:03,580 --> 02:42:05,500
It's a crime against their free will.

2532
02:42:05,880 --> 02:42:07,060
What if they don't want to nap?

2533
02:42:08,140 --> 02:42:09,300
Actually, that's kind of crazy.

2534
02:42:09,660 --> 02:42:10,760
Who wouldn't want to nap?

2535
02:42:12,460 --> 02:42:14,440
His wife won't answer for some reason.

2536
02:42:15,320 --> 02:42:16,600
A wife who doesn't answer her phone.

2537
02:42:17,020 --> 02:42:18,280
I think I know who that.

2538
02:42:18,300 --> 02:42:18,860
is.

2539
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:24,780
A morally bankrupt man deserves a morally bankrupt wife.

2540
02:42:26,460 --> 02:42:26,920
Kids, apparently.

2541
02:42:27,920 --> 02:42:29,580
Why doesn't that man understand that?

2542
02:42:30,360 --> 02:42:32,640
Oh, I'm sorry I ever brought this guy along.

2543
02:42:33,940 --> 02:42:35,560
Me too, a little bit.

2544
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:40,800
Let's examine the pills first.

2545
02:42:42,300 --> 02:42:44,540
So this medicine stops the minister's attacks, eh?

2546
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:48,280
If I could, I'd spill them onto his desk right now, but
unfortunately I don't know.

2547
02:42:48,300 --> 02:42:49,420
I can't even open the cap.

2548
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:53,760
What a shabby excuse for a man.

2549
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:55,820
Thank you, thank you.

2550
02:42:58,840 --> 02:43:00,500
Agidor, a simp.

2551
02:43:01,740 --> 02:43:03,200
Sorry, you lost the gotcha.

2552
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:06,160
But thank you!

2553
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:12,060
He wears his important-looking uniform and sits working at
his stately desk.

2554
02:43:12,480 --> 02:43:13,780
But what does he have inside?

2555
02:43:14,180 --> 02:43:14,660
Nothing!

2556
02:43:15,080 --> 02:43:17,220
A miserable shabby excuse for a man.

2557
02:43:18,300 --> 02:43:22,620
you have already said quite enough oh wait

2558
02:43:29,480 --> 02:43:35,520
if only he could at least drink some of this water it's
about he knocks this pitcher out to the floor at the end of

2559
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:45,120
this four minutes such a stupid man once water is spilled
there's no getting it back and knowing this full well why do

2560
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:51,000
people still spill water pitchers so true It's so true.

2561
02:43:51,720 --> 02:43:52,200
I don't know.

2562
02:43:52,600 --> 02:43:55,860
Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it?

2563
02:43:58,940 --> 02:44:00,600
Let's flap the flag.

2564
02:44:02,500 --> 02:44:03,580
He doesn't notice.

2565
02:44:04,800 --> 02:44:05,820
He's so sad.

2566
02:44:06,860 --> 02:44:09,200
Oh, why doesn't she answer?

2567
02:44:10,960 --> 02:44:16,280
I guess let's be the medicine bottle for now and see what we
can do when he grabs us.

2568
02:44:17,880 --> 02:44:18,320
Arrgh!

2569
02:44:30,420 --> 02:44:30,860
Um...

2570
02:44:33,060 --> 02:44:33,500
No...

2571
02:44:33,500 --> 02:44:33,960
No!

2572
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:34,760
Oh!

2573
02:44:36,020 --> 02:44:36,140
Oh!

2574
02:44:36,400 --> 02:44:36,440
Oh!

2575
02:44:36,540 --> 02:44:36,580
Oh!

2576
02:44:36,580 --> 02:44:36,780
Oh!

2577
02:44:36,780 --> 02:44:37,220
Oh!

2578
02:44:37,220 --> 02:44:37,600
Oh!

2579
02:44:39,240 --> 02:44:39,400
Uh...

2580
02:44:42,110 --> 02:44:42,550
Wait,

2581
02:44:50,020 --> 02:44:50,680
I think I messed up.

2582
02:44:50,980 --> 02:44:51,020
Oh!

2583
02:44:51,280 --> 02:44:51,780
The sword!

2584
02:44:51,940 --> 02:44:52,800
Swing the sword!

2585
02:44:55,820 --> 02:44:58,060
Oh, raise the arm!

2586
02:44:59,000 --> 02:44:59,920

Swing the sword.

2590
02:45:12,880 --> 02:45:14,240
No, no, no, swing it.

2591
02:45:14,560 --> 02:45:17,420
I think he's dead.

2592
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:20,000
Swing the sword?

2593
02:45:20,660 --> 02:45:20,780
Okay.

2594
02:45:24,060 --> 02:45:24,700

There's a flag.

We can also flab.

2618
02:48:04,680 --> 02:48:05,400
Does it do anything?

Can't use the phones.

2627
02:48:27,800 --> 02:48:28,160
I...

2628
02:48:28,180 --> 02:48:28,860
Okay, okay.

2629
02:48:29,280 --> 02:48:30,780
Even though we knocked it off the thing.

2630
02:48:32,820 --> 02:48:34,480
Let's find another path.

2631
02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:35,120
Sorry.

2632
02:48:35,660 --> 02:48:36,360
There we go.

2633
02:48:38,840 --> 02:48:41,440
I thought we could stabilize it or something.

2634
02:48:42,460 --> 02:48:42,840
No.

2635
02:48:44,700 --> 02:48:45,320
Okay.

2636
02:48:46,640 --> 02:48:49,900
Okay, I think we have to...

2637
02:48:49,900 --> 02:48:51,780
Oh, the flag now!

2638
02:48:52,800 --> 02:48:54,200
You guys are so smart.

2639
02:48:55,940 --> 02:48:57,880
The flag to stabilize it.

2640
02:48:58,180 --> 02:49:13,900
to be like and make it make it go okay so i was i was on the
right path with the flag i think okay okay okay i have

2641
02:49:13,900 --> 02:49:17,520
another mango yeah hello but

2642
02:49:26,380 --> 02:49:36,820
now you not even work reach for it there it is

2643
02:49:41,420 --> 02:49:43,240
Everything else was a red herring.

2644
02:49:45,180 --> 02:49:48,040
Well, I was thinking initially, I was like...

2645
02:49:49,280 --> 02:49:51,040
Somehow getting the mango...

2646
02:49:52,180 --> 02:49:54,040
On the sword and then...

2647
02:49:54,660 --> 02:49:55,940
Is golfing it over?

2648
02:49:56,300 --> 02:49:56,940
Putting it over?

2649
02:49:58,160 --> 02:49:58,680
But...

2650
02:49:59,560 --> 02:50:00,080
But...

2651
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:05,640
When I couldn't do that...

2652
02:50:05,640 --> 02:50:09,460
And there wasn't anything else over there that would really
let me do...

2653
02:50:10,600 --> 02:50:11,760
I was confused.

2654
02:50:13,220 --> 02:50:14,280
There, that should help.

2655
02:50:14,900 --> 02:50:16,160
At least he's now had some water.

2656
02:50:18,800 --> 02:50:19,380
Okay, all good.

2657
02:50:20,720 --> 02:50:21,720
He's still breathing, apparently.

2658
02:50:23,360 --> 02:50:25,220
But he looks far from recovered, unfortunately.

2659
02:50:26,600 --> 02:50:28,000
Such a wishy-washy man.

2660
02:50:29,740 --> 02:50:32,220
He can't make up his mind whether to live or die.

2661
02:50:32,740 --> 02:50:33,640
Oh my god.

2662
02:50:34,480 --> 02:50:34,800
Okay.

2663
02:50:35,980 --> 02:50:36,360
Hmm.

2664
02:50:37,240 --> 02:50:39,600
At least now I bought some time to get his medicine to him.

2665
02:50:40,180 --> 02:50:41,400
How do we get over there, actually?

2666
02:50:49,470 --> 02:50:51,130
Wait, now how do I get over there?

2667
02:50:52,370 --> 02:50:52,690
Oh.

2668
02:50:54,330 --> 02:50:54,770
Flap.

2669
02:50:55,490 --> 02:50:55,870
No.

2670
02:50:57,970 --> 02:50:59,290
Wait, how do I get over there?

2671
02:50:59,770 --> 02:51:03,050
The minister's fate has changed, but the situation still
seems the same.

2672
02:51:03,570 --> 02:51:04,550
I can't move anywhere now.

2673
02:51:05,050 --> 02:51:05,670
Did I miss something?

2674
02:51:06,090 --> 02:51:07,030
I think I saw a path.

2675
02:51:07,450 --> 02:51:09,770
Just for a second while the minister was drinking the water.

2676
02:51:13,030 --> 02:51:15,030
A path while he was drinking the water.

2677
02:51:17,190 --> 02:51:17,610
from the beginning.

2678
02:51:17,730 --> 02:51:19,810
Oh, come on, Sis-O!

2679
02:51:21,710 --> 02:51:23,350
Wait, while he was drinking the water?

2680
02:51:29,140 --> 02:51:31,380
Wait, no, but I have to do from the beginning, right?

2681
02:51:32,340 --> 02:51:33,200
I can't do it.

2682
02:51:33,380 --> 02:51:33,520
Wait.

2683
02:51:33,940 --> 02:51:34,560
Hold on.

2684
02:51:34,660 --> 02:51:35,720
What's the fate change?

2685
02:51:36,880 --> 02:51:40,660
Is it while he... When he grabs the water, or...

2686
02:51:40,660 --> 02:51:41,360
No.

2687
02:51:41,740 --> 02:51:41,780
Okay.

2688
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:42,920
From the beginning!

2689
02:51:50,730 --> 02:51:51,130
Okay.

2690
02:51:53,390 --> 02:51:53,790
I...

2691
02:51:54,590 --> 02:51:56,270
Maybe it has something to do with the papers.

2692
02:51:56,490 --> 02:51:58,710
Maybe like a paper flew and I didn't realize it.

2693
02:51:59,230 --> 02:52:01,130
Yeah, because that's the only other thing we can highlight.

2694
02:52:01,750 --> 02:52:02,510
Or the documents.

2695
02:52:04,470 --> 02:52:07,230
Okay, let's hang out in the flag for now.

2696
02:52:08,490 --> 02:52:09,830
It's a split second, but it's there.

2697
02:52:10,350 --> 02:52:11,050
I missed it.

2698
02:52:11,070 --> 02:52:11,570
I missed it.

2699
02:52:19,980 --> 02:52:21,100
Okay, I'm ready.

2700
02:52:22,460 --> 02:52:24,020
I'm ready to flap.

2701
02:52:24,220 --> 02:52:24,980
I'm ready to flap.

2702
02:52:25,200 --> 02:52:25,940
I'm ready to flap.

2703
02:52:27,480 --> 02:52:28,620
Reach for it!

2704
02:52:28,720 --> 02:52:29,660
Oh, that was too early.

2705
02:52:30,500 --> 02:52:31,400
Reach for it!

2706
02:52:38,110 --> 02:52:39,470
Oh, come on!

2707
02:52:43,110 --> 02:52:43,630
No!

2708
02:52:45,970 --> 02:52:48,830
This guy is too clumsy.

2709
02:52:49,270 --> 02:52:51,210
It's stinking butterfingers over here.

2710
02:52:52,190 --> 02:52:53,170
What is wrong with you?

2711
02:52:53,290 --> 02:52:53,610
You don't want...

2712
02:52:53,610 --> 02:52:54,690
Maybe he's right.

2713
02:52:54,950 --> 02:52:56,150
Maybe his ghost self is right.

2714
02:52:56,530 --> 02:52:57,570
Wishing-washy man.

2715
02:52:57,810 --> 02:52:59,310
Do you want to live or do you want to die?

2716
02:53:00,990 --> 02:53:01,410
Oh.

2717
02:53:06,220 --> 02:53:06,780
along.

2718
02:53:08,720 --> 02:53:10,420
Okay, I'm ready to flap.

2719
02:53:17,380 --> 02:53:18,180
Okay.

2720
02:53:19,640 --> 02:53:20,740
Once it's spinning around.

2721
02:53:21,180 --> 02:53:22,140
Once it's spinning around.

2722
02:53:24,260 --> 02:53:24,740
Flap!

2723
02:53:25,300 --> 02:53:26,220
There we go.

2724
02:53:26,480 --> 02:53:26,540
Oh!

2725
02:53:27,240 --> 02:53:29,060
Okay, now let's go to the papers.

2726
02:53:39,820 --> 02:53:40,620
Ah.

2727
02:53:54,930 --> 02:53:55,370
Uh...

2728
02:53:56,490 --> 02:53:56,930
Uh...

2729
02:53:57,730 --> 02:53:58,170
Uh...

2730
02:53:58,970 --> 02:54:00,210
It was the pitcher.

2731
02:54:00,950 --> 02:54:05,590
Oh, I thought when he went crazy, I thought maybe a piece of
paper flew off.

2732
02:54:07,430 --> 02:54:09,050
I gotta go to the pitcher.

2733
02:54:10,390 --> 02:54:13,030
I thought I missed a piece of paper flying in the wind.

2734
02:54:15,330 --> 02:54:17,110
Why people are being like, why papers?

2735
02:54:17,530 --> 02:54:23,450
I said this from the very beginning, I was like, okay, once
he lifts once he lifts the the water i'm gonna go to the

2736
02:54:23,450 --> 02:54:32,250
papers and see if i if i you're just like why did you do
that you stupid ghost when i said it from the beginning that

2737
02:54:32,250 --> 02:54:34,130
that's what i was going to do

2738
02:54:39,760 --> 02:54:48,060
i why did you do the thing that you said that you were going
to try okay reach for the water

2739
02:54:51,840 --> 02:54:53,660
flop okay picture time

2740
02:54:59,300 --> 02:55:03,100
Okay, spin harder.

2741
02:55:05,660 --> 02:55:08,240
And then it will probably blow the paper.

2742
02:55:12,200 --> 02:55:13,380
There, that should help.

2743
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:14,140
Blah, blah, blah.

2744
02:55:14,580 --> 02:55:14,860
Okay.

2745
02:55:15,780 --> 02:55:19,740
Wait, if I spin harder, how am I going to...

2746
02:55:19,740 --> 02:55:20,800
We read all of this.

2747
02:55:21,660 --> 02:55:24,020
How am I going to...

2748
02:55:32,120 --> 02:55:34,000
There we go.

2749
02:55:35,260 --> 02:55:37,540
There we go.

2750
02:55:37,740 --> 02:55:39,460
Oh, how nice.

2751
02:55:40,780 --> 02:55:41,960
All right, now we're here.

2752
02:55:42,780 --> 02:55:43,520
Grab the medicine.

2753
02:55:44,460 --> 02:55:46,240
Time for the next step.

2754
02:55:47,700 --> 02:55:49,340
How about this medicine bottle?

2755
02:55:51,240 --> 02:55:54,000
The minister is going to make a full recovery.

2756
02:55:54,200 --> 02:56:01,600
have to deliver this thing to him how is a ghost with no
hands or feet hey my hands are like this because I'm a ghost

2757
02:56:01,600 --> 02:56:14,580
supposed to do that I guess I'll just have to use my head
instead let's see let's raise this raise the roof whoop

2758
02:56:14,580 --> 02:56:24,700
whoop lower oh okay I was gonna say okay I was going to oh
wait I can reach this now.

2759
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:25,280
Never mind.

2760
02:56:26,060 --> 02:56:26,620
Close the curtain.

2761
02:56:27,760 --> 02:56:28,480
Time is passing.

2762
02:56:29,360 --> 02:56:29,660
Okay.

2763
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:34,600
Raise the roof.

2764
02:56:37,520 --> 02:56:38,380
Spin.

2765
02:56:41,800 --> 02:56:43,100
I'm not quite sure what to do.

2766
02:56:43,740 --> 02:56:44,000
Spin.

2767
02:56:45,800 --> 02:56:45,980
Oh.

2768
02:56:46,700 --> 02:56:47,840
Wrong way.

2769
02:56:48,440 --> 02:56:48,660
Maybe.

2770
02:56:50,060 --> 02:56:50,400
Roll.

2771
02:56:52,320 --> 02:56:53,020
Oh.

2772
02:57:00,480 --> 02:57:12,080
good undo okay i'm just i'm just i'm just fumbling around
right now you guys hold on i'm fumbling around a little bit

2773
02:57:12,080 --> 02:57:21,460
let me see what i can do let me see what's possible um rock
the boat melon

2774
02:57:27,340 --> 02:57:37,300
uh-huh okay okay okay okay so i I roll the globe.

2775
02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:39,500
No.

2776
02:57:42,160 --> 02:57:42,620
Yes?

2777
02:57:42,840 --> 02:57:43,020
Wait.

2778
02:57:45,180 --> 02:57:45,640
Uh.

2779
02:57:46,220 --> 02:57:48,120
Yeah, I roll the globe.

2780
02:57:48,960 --> 02:57:50,480
And then I hit it with the melon.

2781
02:57:51,980 --> 02:57:54,820
Would it be the globe or would it be the...

2782
02:57:54,820 --> 02:57:57,960
Well, actually, it could be either the vase or the globe.

2783
02:57:59,020 --> 02:57:59,820
Not quite sure.

2784
02:58:01,220 --> 02:58:02,880
I think I need to restart, though.

2785
02:58:06,640 --> 02:58:09,440
because I don't have a thing to roll.

2786
02:58:10,960 --> 02:58:13,000
I don't have...

2787
02:58:14,420 --> 02:58:21,620
But I need the globe to drop to knock down the vase.

2788
02:58:45,280 --> 02:58:47,400
I don't think it's supposed to be a catapult.

2789
02:58:48,700 --> 02:58:49,980
I think it's supposed to be...

2790
02:58:51,540 --> 02:58:52,960
Like, hold on.

2791
02:58:53,060 --> 02:59:09,160
The globe drops from here and rolls onto here down and then
when it gets to this side we use the melon to to wait I'm

2792
02:59:09,160 --> 02:59:14,680
not so sure actually swing take

2793
02:59:17,870 --> 02:59:25,830
all the time you need I don't I don't have time let's see
what they say that was so close if the swing just had a

2794
02:59:25,830 --> 02:59:33,510
little more reach to it I think it'd be I think I'd better
look for something else Oh,

2795
02:59:51,640 --> 02:59:52,260
uh-oh.

2796
03:00:00,120 --> 03:00:06,960
Okay, I'm going to try spinning the globe next time and
seeing if that works.

2797
03:00:08,320 --> 03:00:08,960
Goodbye, mister.

2798
03:00:12,040 --> 03:00:14,080
From the fate change.

2799
03:00:17,080 --> 03:00:18,420
Okay, okay, okay.

2800
03:00:21,420 --> 03:00:23,100
Spin harder.

2801
03:00:25,180 --> 03:00:26,640
All right, here we go.

2802
03:00:30,700 --> 03:00:33,080
Alrighty, I'm going ghost.

2803
03:00:58,990 --> 03:00:59,470
No.

2804
03:01:00,390 --> 03:01:05,110
I think this is the order, the order that I did before, I
think is correct?

2805
03:01:05,790 --> 03:01:09,530
Because otherwise, the painting will be facing slanted this
way.

2806
03:01:10,810 --> 03:01:12,810
And that won't help me with...

2807
03:01:14,090 --> 03:01:17,030
That won't help, it'll just Let's fly over the medicine.

2808
03:01:20,390 --> 03:01:21,910
It'll fly over the medicine, right?

2809
03:01:24,070 --> 03:01:26,850
So let's close this.

2810
03:01:30,730 --> 03:01:32,270
Raise the roof.

2811
03:01:35,030 --> 03:01:35,710
Salute.

2812
03:01:37,890 --> 03:01:38,890
Turn around.

2813
03:01:39,150 --> 03:01:39,610
No, wait.

2814
03:01:39,850 --> 03:01:41,070
I didn't turn before.

2815
03:01:43,210 --> 03:01:43,230
Boss.

2816
03:01:52,380 --> 03:01:53,060
Spin?

2817
03:01:53,060 --> 03:01:56,020
Let's see what happens here.

2818
03:01:56,200 --> 03:01:56,280
Ah!

2819
03:02:01,380 --> 03:02:01,820
Oh!

2820
03:02:02,220 --> 03:02:03,920
But this can knock this over.

2821
03:02:04,620 --> 03:02:06,160
This one can get knocked over.

2822
03:02:07,580 --> 03:02:08,840
This one right here.

2823
03:02:28,050 --> 03:02:28,290
Wait.

2824
03:02:29,410 --> 03:02:30,690
Was it this way?

2825
03:02:31,610 --> 03:02:32,270
Wait.

2826
03:02:39,380 --> 03:02:39,880
Wait.

2827
03:02:48,420 --> 03:02:49,660
Hold on.

2828
03:02:50,780 --> 03:02:51,260
Oh.

2829
03:02:57,220 --> 03:02:57,580
Wait.

2830
03:02:58,540 --> 03:02:59,300
Oh.

2831
03:03:07,900 --> 03:03:10,220
That's exactly what I said I didn't want to happen.

2832
03:03:12,980 --> 03:03:14,440
Read the thought bubbles for hints.

2833
03:03:14,600 --> 03:03:17,500
I don't, I'm purposefully not reading it because I do not
want to hint.

2834
03:03:18,540 --> 03:03:19,420
I want to figure it out.

2835
03:03:21,260 --> 03:03:22,020
I don't want to hint.

2836
03:03:23,180 --> 03:03:24,980
I'm trying to figure it out myself.

2837
03:03:25,480 --> 03:03:27,520
Though I already feel that I messed up.

2838
03:03:29,460 --> 03:03:30,700
Though I feel that I have all...

2839
03:03:30,720 --> 03:03:32,720
I already made a grave mistake.

2840
03:03:34,060 --> 03:03:34,440
Ah.

2841
03:03:38,740 --> 03:03:39,380
Globe.

2842
03:03:41,340 --> 03:03:41,980
Woo!

2843
03:03:51,190 --> 03:03:53,450
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2844
03:03:53,450 --> 03:03:55,350
So, I maybe...

2845
03:03:55,930 --> 03:03:56,010
Wait.

2846
03:04:02,030 --> 03:04:04,310
Well, like I said, if I do this...

2847
03:04:05,170 --> 03:04:06,150
If I... if I...

2848
03:04:06,150 --> 03:04:07,710
Wait, if I do this...

2849
03:04:08,430 --> 03:04:09,210
But then I...

2850
03:04:25,210 --> 03:04:26,170
Stop posting!

2851
03:04:26,810 --> 03:04:27,390
Stop posting!

2852
03:04:27,410 --> 03:04:28,410
the answers.

2853
03:04:29,190 --> 03:04:30,990
Stop posting the answers I'm not reading.

2854
03:04:33,150 --> 03:04:35,050
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

2855
03:04:35,790 --> 03:04:39,950
I said no hints, I said no hints.

2856
03:04:43,020 --> 03:04:43,820
Oh my god, time limit.

2857
03:04:52,540 --> 03:04:53,020
Okay.

2858
03:04:54,960 --> 03:04:55,700
Shut up, Cecil.

2859
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,520
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

2860
03:04:59,160 --> 03:05:00,020
Let's see.

2861
03:05:30,980 --> 03:05:31,500
so

2862
03:05:40,450 --> 03:05:50,870
many moving parts honestly a great puzzle to think through
yeah it is fun it's interesting for sure okay i feel like

2863
03:05:50,870 --> 03:06:02,000
i'm just gonna have to try it and if it's not the correct
way i do it the opposite way i guess i suppose

2864
03:06:06,220 --> 03:06:07,120
Wait, wait, wait.

2865
03:06:07,880 --> 03:06:09,460
No, we want the...

2866
03:06:13,530 --> 03:06:14,890
Yeah, no.

2867
03:06:15,130 --> 03:06:15,830
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2868
03:06:19,090 --> 03:06:19,990
Trial and error.

2869
03:06:20,850 --> 03:06:21,610
Exactly, exactly.

2870
03:06:22,310 --> 03:06:25,950
Because sometimes something might not go as you predict it
will.

2871
03:06:27,190 --> 03:06:30,130
And I'm just kind of confused over on this end.

2872
03:06:30,290 --> 03:06:32,150
If I do this, what do I knock over?

2873
03:06:33,370 --> 03:06:34,070
You know what I mean?

2874
03:06:34,170 --> 03:06:36,510
Like, if I knock this down...

2875
03:06:36,510 --> 03:06:37,490
Okay, if I knock this down...

2876
03:06:37,510 --> 03:06:49,050
and create the if I create the the little angle like this
like before I feel like the and then if I drop this if I

2877
03:06:49,050 --> 03:07:03,350
drop the top thing and put the globe here and drop this down
and catapult it but it'll just fly into the air I feel I

2878
03:07:07,410 --> 03:07:09,710
feel like the vase will just fly into the air.

2879
03:07:11,590 --> 03:07:12,490
Just try it.

2880
03:07:13,450 --> 03:07:13,630
Okay.

2881
03:07:13,890 --> 03:07:14,390
You're right.

2882
03:07:14,750 --> 03:07:15,850
Might as well just try something.

2883
03:07:18,670 --> 03:07:18,870
Phew!

2884
03:07:24,770 --> 03:07:25,690
Oh, wait.

2885
03:07:25,890 --> 03:07:27,570
If I...

2886
03:07:27,570 --> 03:07:28,470
Oh, no.

2887
03:07:28,550 --> 03:07:31,550
I need to... I need to turn it.

2888
03:07:33,690 --> 03:07:35,510
And then I need to rock it.

2889
03:07:37,070 --> 03:07:37,630
Rock it.

2890
03:07:37,650 --> 03:07:50,630
baby oh okay and then if i go here and do these it's called
thinking out loud i'm an out loud thinker why did the

2891
03:07:50,630 --> 03:08:01,170
thought bubble come up it's scaring me make me feel like i
did it wrong okay and now we go to here here and uh to there

2892
03:08:01,170 --> 03:08:09,650
and we knock you down phew time is passing And then we...

2893
03:08:11,090 --> 03:08:15,800
When I turned it around, it still knocked over the base,
isn't it?

2894
03:08:17,390 --> 03:08:18,650
I think so.

2895
03:08:19,990 --> 03:08:20,470
Spin!

2896
03:08:22,290 --> 03:08:22,610
Oh!

2897
03:08:24,370 --> 03:08:25,030
What?

2898
03:08:25,330 --> 03:08:25,670
Roll?

2899
03:08:32,710 --> 03:08:33,370
Oh!

2900
03:08:34,510 --> 03:08:36,230
Wait, can I roll that?

2901
03:08:36,570 --> 03:08:37,650
No, I can't roll that.

2902
03:08:37,790 --> 03:08:42,450
Oh, wait, am I catapulting?

2903
03:08:42,470 --> 03:08:44,470
Am I catapulting?

2904
03:08:48,250 --> 03:08:49,330
Wait, hold on.

2905
03:08:49,450 --> 03:08:50,090
I need more time!

2906
03:08:50,370 --> 03:08:51,750
Don't rush me game!

2907
03:08:54,450 --> 03:09:04,490
Wait, so if I put this in the middle, this vase, and roll
this here, and then that knocks down.

2908
03:09:06,030 --> 03:09:07,710
This catapults the globe.

2909
03:09:08,910 --> 03:09:09,790
Okay, let's try that.

2910
03:09:12,110 --> 03:09:14,010
After this, After the fate change!

2911
03:09:15,850 --> 03:09:18,170
After the fate change!

2912
03:09:20,390 --> 03:09:21,550
Oh, spin harder.

2913
03:09:22,170 --> 03:09:22,830
Spin harder.

2914
03:09:23,190 --> 03:09:24,230
Spin harder.

2915
03:09:25,830 --> 03:09:26,090
Okay.

2916
03:09:36,290 --> 03:09:38,510
Beep, peep, boep, boep, boep, boep, boep, boop.

2917
03:09:41,890 --> 03:09:42,890
So we go.

2918
03:09:45,710 --> 03:09:48,750
And then that also makes it so that falls on, the melon
falls...

2919
03:09:49,410 --> 03:09:49,930
Oh wait, no.

2920
03:09:50,110 --> 03:10:02,950
We have to have this fall down instead of the melon oh wait
I want to go up I want to go up real quick we undo this guy

2921
03:10:02,950 --> 03:10:20,730
a little undo a little screws loose wait yeah no okay okay
this

2922
03:10:34,310 --> 03:10:47,240
way spin it went the wrong way I

2923
03:10:57,060 --> 03:11:09,840
remember getting tricked by that too yeah it's a little it
feels like a little like not misleading I think is the wrong

2924
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:15,840
word but you kind of like your brain thinks like oh if it's
facing the direction of the base then it will go to the

2925
03:11:15,840 --> 03:11:17,700
direction of the base you know what i mean

2926
03:11:23,440 --> 03:11:34,540
okay if it didn't take so much to get there it wouldn't have
been an issue i wish i could turn off the intensity of the

2927
03:11:34,540 --> 03:11:43,760
ghost trick effect you know that's the only thing that makes
me you know what i will turn this while we're here

2928
03:11:47,700 --> 03:11:49,220
I will turn that.

2929
03:11:49,880 --> 03:11:51,520
Oh, I unlocked a bunch of stuff.

2930
03:11:52,100 --> 03:11:53,660
I don't know why.

2931
03:11:53,860 --> 03:11:55,060
I just unlocked it now.

2932
03:11:55,380 --> 03:11:55,760
But okay.

2933
03:11:57,920 --> 03:11:59,220
Time is passing.

2934
03:11:59,420 --> 03:12:00,820
I'm working on it.

2935
03:12:01,360 --> 03:12:03,440
Gosh, don't rush me.

2936
03:12:05,240 --> 03:12:05,600
Okay.

2937
03:12:06,260 --> 03:12:07,420
Now we turn it.

2938
03:12:08,560 --> 03:12:10,670
And then we spin it.

2939
03:12:13,060 --> 03:12:13,700
Pshah.

2940
03:12:14,900 --> 03:12:15,480
Okay.

2941
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:17,640
Then we drop it.

2942
03:12:17,700 --> 03:12:18,500
like it's hot.

2943
03:12:38,210 --> 03:12:39,430
No time is passing.

2944
03:12:39,830 --> 03:12:40,090
Wait.

2945
03:12:41,910 --> 03:12:43,090
Then we drop the globe.

2946
03:12:43,470 --> 03:12:44,170
Okay, sorry.

2947
03:12:50,720 --> 03:12:55,700
Wait, we drop the globe and then we drop the other vase,
right?

2948
03:12:59,740 --> 03:13:04,100
Spin it, tap it, bonk it, twirl it.

2949
03:13:05,160 --> 03:13:05,860
Think so, yeah?

2950
03:13:06,120 --> 03:13:06,340
Right.

2951
03:13:11,060 --> 03:13:12,380
And then we, yeah.

2952
03:13:12,760 --> 03:13:16,040
And then we will go back and we would launch the globe.

2953
03:13:22,960 --> 03:13:24,140
I sure hope this works.

2954
03:13:25,160 --> 03:13:25,860
Oh wait, not turn.

2955
03:13:27,100 --> 03:13:27,580
Rock.

2956
03:13:40,420 --> 03:13:40,900
Yippee!

2957
03:13:48,390 --> 03:13:49,350
Mumbai medicine!

2958
03:13:53,370 --> 03:13:54,190
Oh my god.

2959
03:13:54,450 --> 03:13:56,390
Whoa, I don't think that's gonna help you, mister.

2960
03:13:57,250 --> 03:13:58,290
I don't think that's gonna help you.

2961
03:13:58,570 --> 03:13:59,090
Help you!

2962
03:14:00,370 --> 03:14:02,230
The minister finally took his medicine.

2963
03:14:02,250 --> 03:14:05,590
Okay, it took me a minute to get that, but we finally got
there.

2964
03:14:06,310 --> 03:14:06,690
Yippee.

2965
03:14:08,990 --> 03:14:11,250
I think maybe he took too much medicine.

2966
03:14:12,870 --> 03:14:14,230
Such a greedy man.

2967
03:14:15,630 --> 03:14:17,750
He's supposed to take two capsules with water.

2968
03:14:18,590 --> 03:14:19,630
Why doesn't he know that?

2969
03:14:20,590 --> 03:14:22,150
Aw, cut the guy some slack.

2970
03:14:22,750 --> 03:14:22,970
There?

2971
03:14:23,810 --> 03:14:24,610
Oh, there.

2972
03:14:24,890 --> 03:14:25,090
See?

2973
03:14:26,830 --> 03:14:28,110
He took his meds.

2974
03:14:28,230 --> 03:14:29,310
Everyone be like him.

2975
03:14:33,270 --> 03:14:33,790
Two.

2976
03:14:33,810 --> 03:14:36,210
Too much medicine challenge.

2977
03:14:40,780 --> 03:14:42,520
We saw all of them go into his mouth.

2978
03:14:43,260 --> 03:14:46,240
Well, we don't know if he'd swallowed all of them.

2979
03:14:51,320 --> 03:14:53,040
That was a lot of work.

2980
03:14:53,300 --> 03:14:53,860
Yeah, it was.

2981
03:14:54,420 --> 03:14:55,100
You're telling me.

2982
03:14:55,900 --> 03:14:57,720
Well, hopefully this taught him a lesson.

2983
03:14:58,680 --> 03:14:58,880
Huh?

2984
03:14:59,420 --> 03:15:02,720
He greatly underestimated his dependence on his medicine.

2985
03:15:03,220 --> 03:15:05,480
I hope he learned something from this experience.

2986
03:15:07,420 --> 03:15:08,980
First, know yourself.

2987
03:15:09,440 --> 03:15:10,900
That is the key to everything.

2988
03:15:12,180 --> 03:15:14,340
I think you need to listen to your own advice, buddy.

2989
03:15:15,100 --> 03:15:16,940
Anyway, let's go back to the world of the present.

2990
03:15:23,020 --> 03:15:23,940
Take your meds.

2991
03:15:29,880 --> 03:15:32,460
And so the justice minister is now back to life.

2992
03:15:32,960 --> 03:15:35,460
But the furrows on his brow are even deeper now.

2993
03:15:38,240 --> 03:15:39,080
Oh, Lynn!

2994
03:15:39,740 --> 03:15:43,480
And apparently our lady detective is the present cause of
those furrows.

2995
03:15:47,360 --> 03:15:53,160
Look, detective, he was sentenced after a fair trial, and
the man himself wants to be executed.

2996
03:15:55,360 --> 03:15:56,640
But there was no evidence!

2997
03:15:57,040 --> 03:15:58,700
All they had was his own confession!

2998
03:16:00,580 --> 03:16:02,280
But it was no ordinary confession.

2999
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:07,760
It was the confession of an esteemed detective.

3000
03:16:09,200 --> 03:16:10,920
Oh, stay back!

3001
03:16:11,360 --> 03:16:14,160
I told you I don't want anybody coming near me.

3002
03:16:15,140 --> 03:16:16,540
Okay, you're sensitive.

3003
03:16:18,240 --> 03:16:19,680
Mr. Minister, please listen to me!

3004
03:16:20,280 --> 03:16:23,340
I might be able to gather new evidence in that case tonight!

3005
03:16:25,160 --> 03:16:25,620
What?

3006
03:16:27,120 --> 03:16:30,200
So please, please just give me a little more time!

3007
03:16:33,360 --> 03:16:35,440
I just got a call from the prison.

3008
03:16:35,960 --> 03:16:38,520
Your death row convict apparently just escaped.

3009
03:16:40,640 --> 03:16:44,600
Unfortunately, after all this time, it seems he now wants to
dodge his punishment.

3010
03:16:46,380 --> 03:17:00,420
but when he is apprehended his sentence will be carried well
he got apprehended like really fast so tonight no but when

3011
03:17:00,420 --> 03:17:08,880
the sentence was handed down you were against enforcing the
death penalty so why did you sign the order all of the

3012
03:17:08,880 --> 03:17:15,540
sudden hmm well I I was simply performing my duty as justice
minister.

3013
03:17:16,260 --> 03:17:17,400
That's all there is to it.

3014
03:17:18,160 --> 03:17:25,180
Doubling back about the faulty memories, does anybody else
remember a British Lin or am I getting Mandela effect?

3015
03:17:28,160 --> 03:17:30,060
Hmm, that's so mysterious.

3016
03:17:30,780 --> 03:17:32,300
I think you're getting Mandela effect.

3017
03:17:34,120 --> 03:17:35,240
Right, everybody?

3018
03:17:39,150 --> 03:17:40,390
You're crazy.

3019
03:17:41,790 --> 03:17:43,070
She was never British.

3020
03:17:46,050 --> 03:17:46,390
Okay.

3021
03:17:46,790 --> 03:17:48,750
let's hit her in the head.

3022
03:17:49,010 --> 03:17:49,530
Wham!

3023
03:17:50,010 --> 03:17:51,910
Oh, oh wait, that actually worked.

3024
03:17:54,710 --> 03:17:56,430
Sissel, there you are.

3025
03:17:58,050 --> 03:18:00,170
Sounds like the minister is being very stubborn.

3026
03:18:01,770 --> 03:18:02,310
That's right.

3027
03:18:02,830 --> 03:18:03,370
Hey, yes.

3028
03:18:03,750 --> 03:18:04,390
Oh, sorry.

3029
03:18:05,370 --> 03:18:07,150
Maybe we shouldn't have saved him after all.

3030
03:18:07,670 --> 03:18:07,970
Damn.

3031
03:18:12,170 --> 03:18:22,440
Let him... The minister has to be, or has to have the
execution it out tonight and he has a very good reason for

3032
03:18:22,440 --> 03:18:38,600
it a good reason i told lynn about what i learned about the
kidnapping kidnapping oh sorry they kidnapped the justice

3033
03:18:38,600 --> 03:18:45,000
minister's daughter apparently oh my goodness Hmm.

3034
03:18:47,260 --> 03:18:48,260
Mint napping.

3035
03:18:48,760 --> 03:18:49,760
No, no, no.

3036
03:18:50,780 --> 03:18:51,400
But still.

3037
03:18:53,540 --> 03:18:56,840
That's still no reason to hurry forward with the execution.

3038
03:18:58,240 --> 03:19:00,700
Why don't you go ahead and say that to the justice minister
then?

3039
03:19:00,880 --> 03:19:01,000
Oh.

3040
03:19:02,040 --> 03:19:05,580
Your daughter's life is not worth more than this man.

3041
03:19:07,480 --> 03:19:08,380
The poor man.

3042
03:19:08,760 --> 03:19:09,940
I hate to do that to him.

3043
03:19:10,960 --> 03:19:11,700
Oh, by the way.

3044
03:19:13,300 --> 03:19:15,060
Do you think you could carry me?

3045
03:19:16,900 --> 03:19:17,520
Sure.

3046
03:19:18,040 --> 03:19:19,320
Not very handy, is it not?

3047
03:19:19,620 --> 03:19:20,280
Having no legs.

3048
03:19:21,940 --> 03:19:22,520
Oh my gosh.

3049
03:19:22,740 --> 03:19:25,200
She's got the whole world.

3050
03:19:25,840 --> 03:19:26,900
In her hand.

3051
03:19:27,100 --> 03:19:28,660
She's got the whole...

3052
03:19:28,660 --> 03:19:30,240
Wait, what was...

3053
03:19:30,240 --> 03:19:32,700
What is that black dot on the...

3054
03:19:33,520 --> 03:19:34,720
On the globe?

3055
03:19:36,360 --> 03:19:38,160
Oh, you can't get any closer?

3056
03:19:41,620 --> 03:19:54,340
This sword and globe is heavy and I'm it oh it's the North
Pole oh I thought it was a bug and I'm in here too don't

3057
03:19:54,340 --> 03:20:00,900
forget I guess that means a single soul is heavier than the
whole world maybe I'll use this thing to persuade the

3058
03:20:00,900 --> 03:20:10,800
minister to change his mind good luck with that dang all
right let's see what he's saying what are you going to do

3059
03:20:10,800 --> 03:20:14,460
with that globe crack me in the head with it Oh, this?

3060
03:20:15,540 --> 03:20:16,780
Pay no attention to this.

3061
03:20:17,920 --> 03:20:19,480
Kind of hard not to pay attention to it.

3062
03:20:19,820 --> 03:20:21,900
I know she looks like she's actually going to attack him.

3063
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:25,700
By the way, and please pardon me if this is a silly
question.

3064
03:20:26,220 --> 03:20:28,360
Were you talking to someone just now?

3065
03:20:29,460 --> 03:20:30,540
But of course not, right?

3066
03:20:30,780 --> 03:20:35,520
I mean, there's no such thing as ghosts, right?

3067
03:20:36,540 --> 03:20:38,620
Are you talking about me?

3068
03:20:40,100 --> 03:20:42,340
Are you talking about me?

3069
03:20:43,600 --> 03:20:44,240
phantom.

3070
03:20:46,240 --> 03:20:47,840
No, there's no such thing.

3071
03:20:48,140 --> 03:20:48,820
This is a dream.

3072
03:20:49,160 --> 03:20:50,400
It's nothing but a dream.

3073
03:20:51,380 --> 03:20:52,920
Don't you remember me?

3074
03:20:55,160 --> 03:20:57,600
My dream is talking to me!

3075
03:20:59,280 --> 03:21:01,220
So now I'm a dream, right?

3076
03:21:03,260 --> 03:21:07,400
Oh gosh, I'm starting to want to play Minecraft.

3077
03:21:08,920 --> 03:21:09,580
Mr. Minister?

3078
03:21:10,660 --> 03:21:11,120
We know.

3079
03:21:11,480 --> 03:21:12,540
We know about your daughter.

3080
03:21:13,300 --> 03:21:14,720
She was kidnapped, wasn't she?

3081
03:21:18,680 --> 03:21:23,740
And if the execution doesn't take place tonight, you won't
see her again.

3082
03:21:26,980 --> 03:21:27,440
Yes!

3083
03:21:27,660 --> 03:21:28,860
Oh, oh, oh, God!

3084
03:21:29,240 --> 03:21:30,360
Oh, your medicine!

3085
03:21:31,080 --> 03:21:32,600
He took the whole bottle, though.

3086
03:21:33,780 --> 03:21:34,160
Uh-oh.

3087
03:21:34,540 --> 03:21:36,600
I think we just committed a murder.

3088
03:21:41,430 --> 03:21:43,030
What am I going to do?

3089
03:21:45,010 --> 03:21:46,430
The death row prisoner.

3090
03:21:46,510 --> 03:21:47,210
has escaped.

3091
03:21:47,590 --> 03:21:51,210
If he hasn't executed tonight, my daughter, my Ameli!

3092
03:21:52,690 --> 03:21:55,110
But what if that execution isn't the right thing to do?

3093
03:21:57,690 --> 03:21:58,550
Come on, Lin.

3094
03:21:58,790 --> 03:22:01,170
If you keep pressing him like that, he's gonna die again.

3095
03:22:02,050 --> 03:22:03,270
What can I do then?

3096
03:22:04,990 --> 03:22:06,550
Oh, everybody's at a loss.

3097
03:22:07,290 --> 03:22:09,810
Time for me to trick time.

3098
03:22:11,690 --> 03:22:13,570
We have to do something about that kidnapping.

3099
03:22:14,030 --> 03:22:18,510
Until we do that, it'll be impossible to get the minister on
our That's the way I see it.

3100
03:22:20,070 --> 03:22:20,790
Gather info.

3101
03:22:22,450 --> 03:22:22,890
Sorry.

3102
03:22:24,550 --> 03:22:25,710
Let's see what he has to say.

3103
03:22:26,030 --> 03:22:27,170
We meet again, Mr. Minster.

3104
03:22:28,130 --> 03:22:28,390
What?

3105
03:22:28,630 --> 03:22:29,950
I've never seen you before.

3106
03:22:31,430 --> 03:22:33,550
In any case, I'm a very busy man.

3107
03:22:34,590 --> 03:22:37,170
If you're a dream, please don't bother me when I'm awake.

3108
03:22:38,130 --> 03:22:39,670
Uh, I'm not a dream.

3109
03:22:41,930 --> 03:22:42,950
She's making me yawn.

3110
03:22:43,070 --> 03:22:43,930
I'm sorry.

3111
03:22:44,670 --> 03:22:45,150
I'm sorry.

3112
03:22:45,190 --> 03:22:46,310
I'm starting to get so sleepy.

3113
03:22:48,030 --> 03:22:51,350
Looks like it's just a waste of time trying to talk to this
guy.

3114
03:22:51,910 --> 03:22:52,830
I think you're right.

3115
03:22:53,230 --> 03:22:54,390
Stubborn Justice Minister.

3116
03:22:55,330 --> 03:22:58,390
Please stop speaking ill of me inside my own head.

3117
03:22:59,510 --> 03:23:00,290
The voices.

3118
03:23:00,950 --> 03:23:02,530
The voices hate me.

3119
03:23:03,450 --> 03:23:03,910
Alright.

3120
03:23:05,110 --> 03:23:06,790
Should we go to Sexy Lady's house?

3121
03:23:16,490 --> 03:23:17,490
Here we go.

3122
03:23:18,730 --> 03:23:21,210
I really should pay the kidnappers hide out a visit.

3123
03:23:21,570 --> 03:23:23,890
After all, if we want the Justice Minister to come around...

3124
03:23:23,930 --> 03:23:25,510
We have to solve this problem first.

3125
03:23:27,710 --> 03:23:30,510
I feel like I'm slowly moving away from my own mystery.

3126
03:23:31,130 --> 03:23:35,050
But I'm not the kind of guy who can abandon a little lady
and a little lady in trouble.

3127
03:23:35,690 --> 03:23:38,050
So I guess I'm in this for a little while longer.

3128
03:23:44,360 --> 03:23:45,840
Oh, that was it.

3129
03:23:48,560 --> 03:23:50,600
1141 to 1210 AM Challenge.

3130
03:23:51,960 --> 03:23:53,080
Should I call it here?

3131
03:23:53,680 --> 03:23:54,020
Hmm.

3132
03:23:54,020 --> 03:23:57,960
I'm wondering if I should call it here.

3133
03:23:58,120 --> 03:23:58,460
How many?

3134
03:23:58,560 --> 03:23:59,240
We got through what?

3135
03:24:00,720 --> 03:24:01,680
Three chapters?

3136
03:24:02,500 --> 03:24:02,980
Hold on.

3137
03:24:03,240 --> 03:24:04,140
Let me see where we're at.

3138
03:24:05,700 --> 03:24:07,260
A little lighty.

3139
03:24:14,250 --> 03:24:14,730
10.

3140
03:24:15,130 --> 03:24:16,570
Oh, we're on chapter 11.

3141
03:24:16,970 --> 03:24:17,070
What?

3142
03:24:17,270 --> 03:24:18,510
11 out of 18?

3143
03:24:26,620 --> 03:24:27,540
Your call, boss.

3144
03:24:28,140 --> 03:24:31,060
I think maybe the next time we play, I'll endurance it into
the end.

3145
03:24:33,100 --> 03:24:33,540
So.

3146
03:24:34,380 --> 03:24:42,240
doing next chapter would make for a spice at your end oh is
it is it long though is it super long

3147
03:24:53,060 --> 03:24:56,720
it will be long yeah stopping here is okay

3148
03:25:02,720 --> 03:25:11,500
yeah I think maybe I'll just it's a little long it's not
really as long as as long as your puzzle solving skills

3149
03:25:13,080 --> 03:25:17,480
thanks I think sheesh Why am I getting insulted?

3150
03:25:18,220 --> 03:25:20,220
Like this.

3151
03:25:21,580 --> 03:25:24,840
One of the puzzles coming up stumps a lot of people more
than the stealth one.

3152
03:25:25,120 --> 03:25:25,560
Oh, really?

3153
03:25:26,240 --> 03:25:26,540
Okay.

3154
03:25:29,320 --> 03:25:29,840
Hmm.

3155
03:25:31,780 --> 03:25:34,880
Okay, maybe I'll just, uh...

3156
03:25:34,880 --> 03:25:37,260
Oh, since I can't stop the eye.

3157
03:25:37,500 --> 03:25:42,920
I can endurance it next time we play and we can go to the
end.

3158
03:25:45,240 --> 03:25:45,760
So...

3159
03:25:45,780 --> 03:25:47,580
Oh gosh, that's a lot of chapters though.

3160
03:25:48,940 --> 03:25:50,980
That's probably going to be like a 10 hour stream.

3161
03:25:51,860 --> 03:25:54,180
I guess that's an endurance, I believe.

3162
03:26:08,840 --> 03:26:10,340
I'm going to have to endure too.

3163
03:26:11,240 --> 03:26:13,220
I really thought we would get through more today.

3164
03:26:14,680 --> 03:26:15,800
It is only 1030.

3165
03:26:16,560 --> 03:26:20,080
Hmm, best mom ever.

3166
03:26:21,900 --> 03:26:23,620
Great job cooking on those puzzles.

3167
03:26:23,740 --> 03:26:25,080
Looking forward to seeing how this ends.

3168
03:26:26,260 --> 03:26:37,220
say tomorrow thank you thank you thank you i would book two
more streams yeah maybe we'll do two streams then okay

3169
03:26:43,200 --> 03:26:49,800
so one next week and then one more the week after and then
it will be good i'll finish it up before i go to japan

3170
03:26:49,800 --> 03:26:57,200
actually that works because i wasn't planning on starting a
new longer series until i get back from japan so once i'm

3171
03:26:57,200 --> 03:27:02,660
back from japan we can start something new Cool.

3172
03:27:04,500 --> 03:27:06,900
Two streams with about four chapters each seems chill.

3173
03:27:07,220 --> 03:27:08,400
I agree, I agree.

3174
03:27:08,680 --> 03:27:09,360
Cool, cool, cool.

3175
03:27:10,500 --> 03:27:12,220
Thanks, guys, for joining again today.

3176
03:27:12,460 --> 03:27:13,120
Thank you.

3177
03:27:15,220 --> 03:27:21,440
It's a little bit less of a cliffhanger, but there's still
so much mystery going on.

3178
03:27:21,820 --> 03:27:24,180
Why couldn't he just say who we were, man?

3179
03:27:24,860 --> 03:27:26,820
Why is he keeping us in such a mystery?

3180
03:27:27,620 --> 03:27:30,500
Also, I want to make sure I'm well rested for Ayami Sensei
tomorrow.

3181
03:27:32,240 --> 03:27:43,340
um there's a little bit i don't want to say an announcement
but something kind of cool um in tomorrow's stream so um i

3182
03:27:43,340 --> 03:27:54,280
think uh i think it would be fun and if you don't know ayami
sensei she's so silly and fun i think um i think uh i think

3183
03:27:54,280 --> 03:28:03,040
you it will be a fun stream yes yes yes so Ayami is so cute.

3184
03:28:03,200 --> 03:28:03,880
I know.

3185
03:28:04,760 --> 03:28:06,900
I love Ayami Sensei so much.

3186
03:28:07,580 --> 03:28:09,620
So, yeah.

Push, push, push.

3189
03:28:15,180 --> 03:28:18,520
And Ayami is... Ayami, does she speak English?

3190
03:28:18,700 --> 03:28:19,620
She does, actually.

3191
03:28:19,800 --> 03:28:21,340
Ayami speaks such good English.

3192
03:28:21,720 --> 03:28:26,400
I'm gonna try and see how much English she'll speak
tomorrow.

3193
03:28:27,860 --> 03:28:32,060
But she is coming to the United States for a convention.

3194
03:28:32,240 --> 03:28:39,640
weekend and um so she's gonna ask me some questions about
the us and she also wanted to kind of get to know me a

3195
03:28:39,640 --> 03:28:48,680
little bit more um since this is our first ever collab
together um and but she was like so nervous she was so

3196
03:28:48,680 --> 03:28:54,740
worried about how she was like i wonder if anybody is going
to come see me at that convention she's gonna be at anime

3197
03:28:54,740 --> 03:29:00,360

going to come see me and then i checked yesterday for her

3198
03:29:00,360 --> 03:29:04,740

autographs are doing.

3199
03:29:04,880 --> 03:29:06,220
And they were all sold out!

3200
03:29:06,680 --> 03:29:09,220
And I was like, or booked up, I guess.

3201
03:29:09,320 --> 03:29:10,740
I don't think they were, I think they were free.

3202
03:29:11,060 --> 03:29:12,360
But they were all like gone.

3203
03:29:12,500 --> 03:29:14,160
And I was like, oh, I sent it to her.

3204
03:29:14,260 --> 03:29:16,240
And I was like, Ayami Sensei!

3205
03:29:16,620 --> 03:29:18,180
You were so worried for nothing.

3206
03:29:20,340 --> 03:29:21,480
So, hmm.

3207
03:29:22,940 --> 03:29:25,080
Everybody be extra nice to Ayami Sensei.

3208
03:29:25,480 --> 03:29:25,880
Yeah.

3209
03:29:27,300 --> 03:29:28,800
They were out within the hour?

3210
03:29:28,980 --> 03:29:29,900
Oh my gosh, really?

3211
03:29:31,020 --> 03:29:31,420
Whoa.

3212
03:29:33,060 --> 03:29:36,040
Reminds me of a certain someone who always underestimates
herself.

3213
03:29:37,240 --> 03:29:38,280
I wonder who that could be.

3214
03:29:40,060 --> 03:29:41,220
You know a lot of people.

3215
03:29:45,860 --> 03:29:49,580
But yeah, so we're going to talk about her coming to the U
.S.

3216
03:29:51,060 --> 03:29:54,480
and what she'll be doing at the convention and some other
stuff.

3217
03:29:54,660 --> 03:29:55,860
Talking about me a little bit.

3218
03:29:58,020 --> 03:29:59,520
Well, maybe more than a little bit.

3219
03:29:59,620 --> 03:30:00,820
She was like so interested.

3220
03:30:00,980 --> 03:30:02,800
She was like, I want to know everything about Mint.

3221
03:30:03,160 --> 03:30:05,000
And so I was like, Okay.

3222
03:30:07,740 --> 03:30:08,500
So yeah.

3223
03:30:08,660 --> 03:30:08,860
Hmm.

3224
03:30:10,240 --> 03:30:12,240
She's the only B2 Brite Ace in this year.

3225
03:30:13,660 --> 03:30:14,820
Yeah, actually you're right.

3226
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:15,560
Oh my gosh.

3227
03:30:16,980 --> 03:30:18,740
But, um, exciting.

3228
03:30:19,920 --> 03:30:21,160
She wants your three sizes.

3229
03:30:21,420 --> 03:30:22,780
That's not even a joke.

3230
03:30:25,020 --> 03:30:26,400
That's not even a joke.

3231
03:30:28,760 --> 03:30:30,160
But yeah, I'm really, really excited.

3232
03:30:30,980 --> 03:30:33,960
I hope then, um, next time we collab, maybe it could be like
a game or something.

3233
03:30:36,780 --> 03:30:51,460
so I'll see you guys tomorrow then for Ayami and that's
Wednesday for English karaoke I have no planned set list so

3254
03:32:08,940 --> 03:32:09,700
Write them down at least.

3255
03:32:10,380 --> 03:32:11,420
Enjoy your trip to Alcatraz.

3256
03:32:12,880 --> 03:32:18,880
If I can go, but beware, the island is the most haunted
location in California and possibly the country.

3257
03:32:19,280 --> 03:32:21,880
Cell Block D in particular is the most haunted place on the
island.

3258
03:32:22,360 --> 03:32:24,400
The island has eons of bad mojo.

3259
03:32:24,900 --> 03:32:26,220
It's okay, I'm a ghost too.

3260
03:32:26,520 --> 03:32:29,780
And if any ghost tries to mess with me, I'll just punch
them.

3261
03:32:32,660 --> 03:32:34,480
Which one is cuter for you, Minty?

3262
03:32:34,920 --> 03:32:36,680
Imperial Storm Troopers, original trilogy.

3263
03:32:36,960 --> 03:32:41,120
Or first order Storm Troopers, sequel trilogy.

3264
03:32:41,620 --> 03:32:43,820
Also, whose armor is cooling your opinion?

3265
03:32:44,480 --> 03:32:46,640
Captain Rex or Commander Wolf?

3266
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:47,460
Okay, hold on.

3267
03:32:47,520 --> 03:32:49,380
I'm going to have to look up all of these real quick.

3268
03:32:52,380 --> 03:32:54,160
This isn't the best super chat in the world.

3269
03:32:54,340 --> 03:32:55,560
This is just a tribute.

3270
03:32:58,480 --> 03:32:59,520
Okay, original...

3271
03:33:00,540 --> 03:33:01,060
Wait.

3272
03:33:01,960 --> 03:33:04,900
First Order Storm Trooper.

3273
03:33:08,280 --> 03:33:10,180
First Order Storm Trooper.

3274
03:33:11,100 --> 03:33:13,220
What's the difference between them and the original?

3275
03:33:13,580 --> 03:33:14,880
Oh, wait, I see.

3276
03:33:14,980 --> 03:33:16,040
Oh, I see it.

3277
03:33:18,460 --> 03:33:19,930
Wait, they look the same to me.

3278
03:33:21,080 --> 03:33:21,620
Am I dumb?

3279
03:33:26,230 --> 03:33:27,170
Um, cooler.

3280
03:33:27,410 --> 03:33:28,410
Captain Rex.

3281
03:33:30,270 --> 03:33:31,670
Captain Rex.

3282
03:33:32,830 --> 03:33:33,790
Star Wars.

3283
03:33:34,750 --> 03:33:36,290
Oh, I like his.

3284
03:33:36,930 --> 03:33:39,010
Or Commander Wolf.

3285
03:33:45,160 --> 03:33:45,820
Oh.

3286
03:33:48,560 --> 03:33:49,220
Oh.

3287
03:33:50,220 --> 03:33:52,580
I think Captain Rex's is cooler.

3288
03:33:56,060 --> 03:33:57,600
Commander Wolf for sure.

3289
03:33:58,880 --> 03:34:00,040
Wait, Wolf is epic.

3290
03:34:00,140 --> 03:34:01,660
Wait, am I looking at the wrong pictures?

3291
03:34:03,140 --> 03:34:04,420
Commander Wolf.

3292
03:34:04,720 --> 03:34:05,200
Hold on.

3293
03:34:06,360 --> 03:34:07,500
Oh, oh, wait.

3294
03:34:07,520 --> 03:34:09,480
Wait, yes, Commander Wolf, you're right.

3295
03:34:09,880 --> 03:34:11,260
I was looking at the wrong thing.

3296
03:34:11,780 --> 03:34:14,860
Yeah, Commander Wolf looks cooler, I think.

3297
03:34:17,140 --> 03:34:18,980
Oh, sorry, everyone said base.

3298
03:34:22,440 --> 03:34:23,760
I don't know.

3299
03:34:23,900 --> 03:34:24,820
Rex is the best.

3300
03:34:24,940 --> 03:34:25,960
And they both look really nice.

3301
03:34:26,080 --> 03:34:26,640
I like the blue.

3302
03:34:31,750 --> 03:34:34,010
How could my Oshi betray me?

3303
03:34:37,110 --> 03:34:40,210
Okay, guys, I'm going to go sleep now.

Just tell us what it is?

3315
03:35:24,110 --> 03:35:26,070
Okay, I saw it on Ami Ami earlier.

03:35:27,570 --> 03:35:28,230
It's a...

3318
03:35:28,810 --> 03:35:29,770
It's a...

3319
03:35:29,770 --> 03:35:29,790
It's a...

3320
03:35:30,310 --> 03:35:35,670
It's a Rubik's Cube, but it transforms into a mech.

3321
03:35:37,470 --> 03:35:39,130
But it's a real Rubik's...

3322
03:35:39,130 --> 03:35:40,210
Well, I don't know if it's a real Rubik's Cube.

3323
03:35:40,230 --> 03:35:40,710
Rubik's Cube.

3324
03:35:42,470 --> 03:35:44,630
But it can turn into a Rubik's Cube.

3325
03:35:45,790 --> 03:35:47,830
Like, like, uh, like the Cube version.

3326
03:35:47,990 --> 03:35:49,890
And then you can also turn it into a mech.

3327
03:35:50,690 --> 03:35:51,910
It's so awesome.

3328
03:35:53,330 --> 03:35:54,110
I want it.

3329
03:35:54,490 --> 03:35:55,250
What's the name?

3330
03:35:57,970 --> 03:35:59,270
Chogokin Rubik's Cube.

3331
03:36:00,910 --> 03:36:01,430
Chogokin.

3332
03:36:02,210 --> 03:36:02,930
Rubik's Cube.

3333
03:36:04,370 --> 03:36:05,770
It's so cool.

3334
03:36:07,030 --> 03:36:08,330
I was looking at it.

3335
03:36:16,800 --> 03:36:17,620
All right.

3336
03:36:18,760 --> 03:36:20,540
I think I was, yeah.

3337
03:36:22,220 --> 03:36:22,680
Anyway.

3338
03:36:26,080 --> 03:36:27,860
Ignoring what I just saw.

3339
03:36:30,980 --> 03:36:32,300
What was I saying?

3340
03:36:33,840 --> 03:36:37,560
I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't support you buying a
transforming toy.

3341
03:36:39,080 --> 03:36:40,640
Nah, I was considering it.

3342
03:36:40,780 --> 03:36:43,900
I was just, but I thought it was so cool, but I don't know
if I'll get it.

3343
03:36:43,920 --> 03:36:56,260
it it's kind of expensive so i was like um and i already
have some other figures i have to wait for so um you know

3344
03:36:58,400 --> 03:37:09,100
anyway okay awesome everybody thank you for hanging out see

3346
03:37:16,460 --> 03:37:17,260

3348
03:37:47,440 --> 03:37:48,480
Look at him!

3349
03:37:52,610 --> 03:37:54,150
He's just a guy!

3350
03:37:54,390 --> 03:37:55,870
He's just so...

3351
03:37:57,810 --> 03:38:00,050
When he transforms into a Rubik's Cube!

3352
03:38:00,750 --> 03:38:05,030
I think if I knew how to solve a Rubik's Cube, I would
definitely get rid of him.

3353
03:38:05,810 --> 03:38:08,470
If I was like a huge Rubik's Cube fan.

3354
03:38:09,090 --> 03:38:12,270
But just the whole thing is such a fun concept.

3355
03:38:12,290 --> 03:38:28,230
right hmm mecha rubix ultimate form that's just a guy yeah

3356
03:38:28,230 --> 03:38:39,450
