1
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,000
It went so fast.

2
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,940
I don't know why so many people thought this was a collab.

3
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,260
I don't know why so many people thought this was a collab.

4
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,880
Sorry to disappoint you, I'm only playing a game.

5
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,900
Because people can't read.

6
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,700
Maybe.

7
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,080
Wow, real Korone on screen.

8
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,100
Oh, Korone-san, what do you have to say?

9
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,660
Welcome to my stream!

10
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,400
She says...

11
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,700
She says...

12
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,520
Wow.

13
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,540
She says wow wow.

14
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,520
Just like the game!

15
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,760
Wow wow wow.

16
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,660
Wow wow wow.

17
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,720
Such true words.

18
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,040
Yeah, she said that, for real.

19
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:14,860
Yeah.

20
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,080
I'm excited to play.

21
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,500
Look at this, this is so cute.

22
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,200
Yubi!

23
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,360
Oh.

24
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,020
One Yubi.

25
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,000
Two Yubi.

26
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,080
Yubi yubi yubi.

27
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,000
Machine gun.

28
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,640
Shotgun.

29
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,640
Bonk bonk bonk hammer.

30
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,120
Wait, she says other things too.

31
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,460
And there's also other weapons to unlock.

32
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,880
I...

33
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,820
I don't know what...

34
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,240
Why...

35
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,260
It looks like a sensor.

36
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:45,860
Bone?

37
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,700
Okay.

38
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,340
Okayu?

39
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:49,900
Cat?

40
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,440
I don't know.

41
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,020
Yubi yubi.

42
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,820
Yubi yubi.

43
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,860
Yubi yubi.

44
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,480
Yubi yubi.

45
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
Machine gun.

46
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,760
Machine gun.

47
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,180
Wow wow wow.

48
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,300
Shotgun.

49
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:01,780
Yeah.

50
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,620
So we're gonna...

51
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,660
We're just gonna hang out and play for a little bit.

52
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,100
Yeah.

53
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,520
Today's stream won't be super long because I have some stuff that I need to get done.

54
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,940
I got a new...

55
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,480
A new thing to build.

56
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,100
A shelf.

57
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,420
I bought a shelf that I have to build.

58
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,880
And...

59
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,400
Just some other things.

60
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,300
Ikea moment.

61
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,380
Yeah.

62
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:29,960
Basically.

63
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,920
Thank you for the tiny gift.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,680
Thank you.

65
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,900
But I just wanted to still chill and hang out.

66
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,080
So I'm gonna...

67
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,840
Chill a little bit.

68
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,880
Today.

69
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,140
Yeah.

70
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,280
And I thought this would be perfect.

71
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,040
So we have a couple...

72
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,880
I've never played this before.

73
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,660
It was just officially released.

74
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,720
Like...

75
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,120
A couple days ago.

76
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:53,700
So...

77
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,280
I do wanna play Holocure.

78
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,000
Because I really like...

79
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,480
I really like...

80
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,560
Vampire Survivor.

81
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,460
And stuff.

82
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,180
So...

83
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:05,660
Yeah.

84
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,060
Yeah.

85
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,060
Um...

86
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,920
Mint don't read.

87
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,180
Oh.

88
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:16,690
But yeah.

89
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,390
Um...

90
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,090
Probably we'll...

91
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,890
Try Holocure at some point too.

92
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,650
We'll just do normal mode.

93
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:23,550
Let's go!

94
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,030
I'm a dog!

95
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,710
Oh.

96
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,090
How do I move?

97
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:26,350
Oh.

98
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,490
Is that a thing I've destroyed?

99
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,390
Actually I'm not sure.

100
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,310
Wait.

101
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:32,970
This way?

102
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:33,290
Oh.

103
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:33,490
What's this?

104
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,870
Help me!

105
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,630
Help me!

106
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,230
Oh.

107
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:35,670
Ah!

108
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,470
Wait.

109
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,010
What is this thing?

110
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:38,830
Oh.

111
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,590
Ow!

112
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,110
Ow!

113
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:42,970
Oh!

114
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,230
There's a...

115
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,790
Oh no!

116
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:53,530
Ah!

117
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,930
Oh, I like the shotgun actually.

118
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:57,850
Oh my gosh.

119
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,270
Oh!

120
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,210
Ow!

121
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:02,810
Ow!

122
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,770
The Danmaku.

123
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,370
It's okay.

124
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,370
I played Touhou.

125
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,470
Sometimes.

126
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,210
Oh no.

127
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,050
This is already so fun.

128
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,130
Right click?

129
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,290
Wait, what's the difference?

130
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,190
Maybe normal mode is too easy.

131
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,670
Ow!

132
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,650
Ow!

133
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,340
I said that and then I died.

134
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,060
Oh my god, the achievement is I died.

135
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,760
Thank you forever.

136
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,520
My score is 2?

137
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,280
That's it?

138
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,100
Let's go, amigo!

139
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,300
Let's go!

140
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,040
Oh, I have to get these.

141
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,000
Yubi yubi!

142
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,540
Oh, the guys come out of there.

143
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,520
I understand now.

144
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,520
I was gonna explode.

145
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,220
Yubi!

146
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,420
I almost walked right into that guy.

147
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,800
Oh, this way.

148
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,460
It's okay.

149
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,180
Again, I play Touhou.

150
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,180
Oh, bonk!

151
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,420
This one feels like you gotta get kinda close on them though, right?

152
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,680
Oh!

153
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,740
Pro Mint Gaming.

154
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:41,640
Obviously.

155
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,540
This way.

156
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,280
Shut the gun!

157
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,140
Shut the gun!

158
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,840
The bonk is kinda dangerous.

159
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,200
Yeah, because you have to get so close.

160
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,380
Collect five Korone boxes.

161
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,980
Okay, hold on.

162
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,100
I don't wanna go through stuff so fast, but I also wanna see the other stages and stuff.

163
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,280
Right?

164
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,760
Hmm.

165
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:14,720
Crazy.

166
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,760
Thanks for the 10 gift.

167
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,440
Thank you.

168
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,060
One hit KO.

169
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,260
One hit KO.

170
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,960
This one looks cute too.

171
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,160
Let's go sunshine, amigo!

172
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:26,920
Sunshine!

173
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,840
Oh!

174
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,720
Get out of my way.

175
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,280
Get out of my way.

176
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,680
Yubi yubi!

177
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,580
Yubi yubi everybody!

178
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,220
Everybody!

179
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,060
Oh my god!

180
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,800
I'm stuck!

181
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,300
Bonk!

182
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,780
Bonk!

183
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,880
Not the bonk.

184
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,960
Also the bonk?

185
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,700
You can't just endlessly shoot.

186
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,320
Sunshine, amigos!

187
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,700
This way?

188
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,080
Thank you, forever.

189
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,480
What?

190
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,880
I used the bonk, you guys all saw.

191
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,460
Let's go sunshine, amigos!

192
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,080
Sunshine!

193
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,040
Sunshine, amigos!

194
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,080
Sunshine!

195
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,580
Yubi revolver!

196
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,060
My favorite.

197
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,000
Wait, I wanna use it a little bit.

198
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,280
Where's the...

199
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,780
Ah!

200
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,300
It bounces!

201
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,780
Wait.

202
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,660
Six shots.

203
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,160
I don't wanna change it.

204
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,640
This can't...

205
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:29,940
Scary!

206
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,400
Shotgun!

207
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,500
Shotgun!

208
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,040
Reach out, reach out.

209
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,180
Yes!

210
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,220
Also, you can't go in the water.

211
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,500
Shotgun!

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,320
Shotgun!

213
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,190
There we go.

214
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,610
Ayayayayayay!

215
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,390
Back off!

216
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:03,870
Back off!

217
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,030
No

218
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:12,880
bonk!

219
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,310
How's everybody doing?

220
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,310
This weekend...

221
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,750
Oh my gosh.

222
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,290
Oh my gosh.

223
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,770
No bonk.

224
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,350
Yubi yubi!

225
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,050
Yubi yubi!

226
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,550
Pretty good.

227
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:40,910
Wow!

228
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,450
Oh my god.

229
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,410
The revolver's powerful, you guys!

230
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:45,890
Hahaha!

231
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,330
Right.

232
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,390
I think the revolver is kinda the best.

233
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,570
No, no bonk!

234
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,770
No bonk!

235
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,710
Yubi yubi!

236
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,530
Six shots.

237
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,570
Grocery shopping.

238
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,850
That's always important to do on the weekends, right?

239
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,810
X potato.

240
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,250
Oh!

241
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,770
I unlocked the X...

242
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,830
Another working Sunday.

243
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:30,970
Happy to listen.

244
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,030
Oh, good luck!

245
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,450
Maybe this is like a harder game to listen to.

246
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,970
It's kinda noisy, right?

247
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:39,810
Let's go, amigo!

248
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:40,930
Let's go!

249
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:41,970
I like this stage.

250
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,330
Wow wow wow!

251
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,250
Machine gun!

252
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,910
Woah!

253
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,430
Woah!

254
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:54,950
Woah!

255
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,370
It's shaky!

256
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,030
Ohohohohoho!

257
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,510
What's the difference between right click...

258
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,650
and left click?

259
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,470
Yubi yubi!

260
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,620
Woah woah woah!

261
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,860
Indeed.

262
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,460
The button.

263
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,720
One is right, the other is not.

264
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,780
Hi!

265
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,580
You're so right.

266
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,060
I don't wanna get rid of my yubi revolver.

267
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,240
Let's go!

268
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,060
I know the shotgun is so powerful, but like...

269
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,680
The revolver is so awesome.

270
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,100
Nice suit.

271
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,020
Machine gun!

272
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,440
Yubi yubi!

273
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,480
Yubi?

274
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,440
Yubi.

275
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,460
Everybody.

276
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,020
Yubi yubi!

277
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,980
Oh yeah!

278
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,380
Shoot everywhere, miss everything.

279
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,900
Got

280
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,400
it.

281
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,340
Thank you, Huweiba.

282
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,560
Got it.

283
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Thank you, Huweiba.

284
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,440
Okay, let's try the next stage.

285
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,340
Okay, let's try the next stage.

286
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,560
The orange box.

287
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,920
Yubi yubi.

288
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,660
Just don't get hit.

289
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,200
Give up your yubis for sacrifice?

290
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,180
You can't even see my yubis!

291
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,680
They're hidden.

292
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,060
They're hidden, my yubis.

293
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,600
Let's go sunshine, amigos!

294
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,320
Let's go

295
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,890
sunshine, amigos!

296
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,730
Wait, this map is kinda whack.

297
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,690
Wait, I don't wanna get the box before I...

298
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,490
Wait,

299
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,350
I don't wanna get the box before I...

300
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,250
Yubi yubi!

301
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,470
Seems kind of a waste to...

302
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,170
To get rid of it.

303
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,350
I'm so good!

304
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,130
Did she just scream?

305
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,670
Oh my god, no!

306
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,450
I don't like the road!

307
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,570
I don't wanna get hit!

308
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,470
Take my yubi.

309
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,330
Wait, who else is shooting?

310
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,610
Oh, those are me.

311
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,610
Bonk, bonk!

312
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,650
Oh no, no bonk, no bonk.

313
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,710
Bonk too difficult, bonk too difficult!

314
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,420
Bonk too hard!

315
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,400
Oh, this way.

316
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:35,920
It is this way.

317
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,520
Run away, run away, run away!

318
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,340
Run away, run away, run away!

319
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,900
Run away, run away, run away!

320
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,180
This way.

321
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,060
Okay, this stage is so... tricky!

322
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,320
Okay, nice.

323
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,500
Okay, nice.

324
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,840
Nice.

325
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,680
Yubi yubi yubi.

326
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,520
Oh my god, it's pushing me away!

327
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,040
Woah, woah, woah!

328
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,200
I'm gonna shot the gun.

329
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,360
This way.

330
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,020
Oh my god.

331
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,260
This way.

332
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,260
Yubi yubi!

333
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,050
Yubi yubi yubi!

334
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,850
This one is kind of noisy though.

335
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:55,490
Ah!

336
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,490
No, no, no, no!

337
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,710
No, no, no, no!

338
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,450
I think we are good.

339
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,410
Wait, this way?

340
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:08,850
How do I get there?

341
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,570
How do I get there?

342
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,670
Oh yeah, yeah!

343
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:12,810
Ow!

344
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,930
This way!

345
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,230
No!

346
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,870
No bonk, no bonk!

347
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:22,910
Where is she?

348
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,270
Oh my god.

349
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,290
Oh my god, no!

350
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,870
You have to get so close!

351
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:27,830
Please!

352
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,160
I think I have to go this way.

353
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,760
Meow!

354
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:37,900
Oh, here we go.

355
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,580
Yubi yubi!

356
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,620
Joshi!

357
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,300
Oh my god.

358
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,200
Oh no, no, no!

359
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,660
Confidence!

360
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,460
There's even bosses!

361
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,020
Oh my gosh.

362
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,740
Thank you so much!

363
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,940
You can parry bullets?

364
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,920
You can?

365
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,160
No confidence.

366
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,940
Have confidence.

367
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,090
It's crazy because I did the best on this round.

368
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,530
Even though the stage was so crazy.

369
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,330
The map is so crazy.

370
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,870
Oh, my contact is...

371
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,670
Let's go Sunshine, amigos!

372
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,500
If only I had gotten the X-Potato Cannon again.

373
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,200
If only I had gotten the X-Potato Cannon again.

374
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,560
Oh!

375
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,900
Maybe it's kind of hard to use too.

376
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,160
Nice!

377
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,100
Nice!

378
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,440
Oh!

379
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,900
I think I am cheating the system.

380
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,560
What do I have right now?

381
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,860
Oh, down here.

382
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,400
Oh

383
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,270
my gosh, that was so close.

384
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:13,770
Owie!

385
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,630
I think I got...

386
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,490
Yeah, I'm stuck.

387
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,730
I'm gonna keep shooting.

388
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,350
There we go.

389
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,710
Oh, here it is.

390
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,090
Yubi yubi!

391
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,570
Am I

392
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,060
hitting anything?

393
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,200
Nothing.

394
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,400
I'm hitting everything and nothing at the same time.

395
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:47,900
Yubi yubi!

396
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,120
Yubi!

397
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,900
No, no, no!

398
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,980
When she laughs, it's so funny.

399
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,100
He's got his back.

400
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,540
Where's the box?

401
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,640
That's a good question.

402
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:08,140
He came from nowhere.

403
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,900
Spray and pray.

404
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,900
Spray and pray.

405
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,580
No, he came from nowhere!

406
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,600
No!

407
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,600
Okay.

408
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,080
Let's go sunshine, amigos!

409
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,040
I feel so much more energy when she says...

410
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,560
When she says amigos.

411
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,020
Actually, I think I prefer shooting in like the...

412
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,700
Oh, this way.

413
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,120
Shooting in like the one...

414
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,780
direction than both.

415
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,360
Using the finger guns like this.

416
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,240
Woah, woah, woah!

417
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,790
Here we go!

418
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,630
Wait, I wanna test it.

419
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,370
Oh, you can!

420
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,590
Kind of...

421
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,290
You can shoot the...

422
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,770
bullets fast.

423
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,970
It's not...

424
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,290
Oh my god, the roaches are so fast.

425
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,370
Oops.

426
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,210
But you do have to be pretty close.

427
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,390
And it's also only...

428
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,950
It's directional, so it's...

429
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,350
a little tricky in that regard.

430
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,310
Oh, that was so close.

431
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,570
That was so close.

432
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,990
Nice!

433
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,500
Uh, this way.

434
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,880
I hear them coming out.

435
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,960
Goodbye, little roach.

436
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,840
Oh my gosh!

437
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,120
X Potato Cannon is OP!

438
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,580
I don't wanna get rid of it!

439
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,340
It's so awesome!

440
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,650
Uh, this way.

441
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,680
Where is she?

442
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,380
Nice!

443
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,240
I think I killed some...

444
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,280
body.

445
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,280
Wait.

446
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,580
Oh my gosh.

447
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:22,860
Ah!

448
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,060
Sorry!

449
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,630
I'm sorry!

450
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,890
I'm sorry!

451
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,170
She literally took a...

452
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,770
Took a...

453
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,550
A cannon to the face.

454
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,310
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

455
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,360
Launched into orbit.

456
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,120
Fuck!

457
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,120
Does it work for these?

458
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,040
Oh, it does!

459
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,280
But it's...

460
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,820
They're slow.

461
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,420
It's tricky.

462
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,500
Okay.

463
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,920
Oh, I need to go this way?

464
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,060
Where is it?

465
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,160
Oh!

466
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,980
The three husketeers?

467
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,760
Wait, where are they?

468
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,140
Oh my gosh.

469
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,440
Oh my gosh.

470
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,140
Oh no!

471
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,450
I got knocked by dog.

472
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,860
I got... I got...

473
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,940
Listener-san needs to chill.

474
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,520
For real.

475
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,680
For real.

476
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,700
Chainsaw!

477
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,380
Glad you're enjoying your Helldivers training.

478
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,620
I didn't even get to...

479
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,900
Shoot the... I didn't even get to see the boss at all.

480
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,900
Camigo, let's go!

481
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,840
This one... This stage is tricky.

482
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,220
But I think I like it.

483
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,360
Nice!

484
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,840
I like the challenge.

485
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,340
Whoa!

486
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,320
Cute bastard!

487
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,220
Thank you for the 50!

488
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,100
Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

489
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,720
Wait, hold on.

490
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,640
What's going on?

491
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:13,940
Oh!

492
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,480
Making sure I don't have a phone call.

493
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:21,780
Oh.

494
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,580
No, we're good.

495
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:22,980
Okay.

496
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,620
My phone was like going crazy for some reason.

497
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,440
It was like, you're streaming!

498
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,020
You're supposed to be streaming!

499
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,750
Dang!

500
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,790
Is it on camera?

501
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,350
If you can use it correctly...

502
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,050
It's pretty good, actually.

503
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,270
It's actually pretty good.

504
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,960
That one...

505
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,260
didn't count.

506
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,380
I don't like the roach.

507
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,420
I'm a dog!

508
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,440
Also, please don't send me super chats about my taxes.

509
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:02,900
Thank you.

510
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,140
I think that's...

511
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,240
Oh!

512
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,080
Okay.

513
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,980
She said have confidence, you guys.

514
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,720
We got this.

515
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,660
Now I'm very confident with my...

516
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,600
weapon.

517
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,740
Oh no!

518
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,020
At least there's no...

519
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,700
Let's go sunshine, amigo!

520
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,820
At least there's no back splash.

521
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,680
Yubi yubi!

522
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,300
No confidence, you guys.

523
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,100
No confidence!

524
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:41,700
It's the...

525
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,280
It's the...

526
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:45,720
roaches.

527
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,660
Oh gosh.

528
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,300
Oh gosh.

529
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,060
Let's get her.

530
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,720
Let's get her now.

531
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,300
Maybe we got her.

532
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,100
I don't know.

533
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,040
Maybe we got her.

534
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,920
There we go.

535
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,260
Okay.

536
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,340
This way.

537
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,210
How am I making so many?

538
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,250
Okay.

539
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,250
Let's choose...

540
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,870
Let's go back to this one.

541
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,050
I like the pepper box.

542
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:19,970
Hard mode.

543
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,290
Let's go sunshine, amigo!

544
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,010
Sunshine!

545
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,330
How hard can it be?

546
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:25,970
Bonk!

547
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:26,410
Bonk!

548
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:26,670
Bonk!

549
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:26,910
Bonk!

550
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,130
How hard can it be, you guys?

551
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,810
I haven't been able to do a single boss.

552
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,830
But how hard can it be?

553
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,670
Bonk!

554
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,110
Bonk!

555
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,370
Bonk!

556
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,270
Machine gun!

557
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,150
The thing

558
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,910
about this game makes me wanna like...

559
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,430
Oh my gosh.

560
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,770
It makes me want to like...

561
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,210
Conserve bullets.

562
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,710
Even though I know that's not a thing.

563
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,330
You know what I mean?

564
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,950
Oh!

565
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,750
We got him!

566
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:02,830
She's back!

567
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:03,970
Shiba!

568
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,330
Shiba!

569
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:04,650
Shiba!

570
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,970
Shiba!

571
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:06,410
Nice.

572
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,250
Where is it?

573
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:29,770
Oh, this way.

574
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,010
Oh my gosh.

575
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,230
Wait.

576
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,610
I think hard mode is kind of in...

577
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,230
It's actual Touhou now.

578
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:36,910
Wait!

579
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:40,910
Oh my god.

580
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,970
Actual Touhou now!

581
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,910
No!

582
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:46,850
Oh my god.

583
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,840
Oh my god.

584
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,640
The machine gun sucks.

585
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,980
It pushes you into all the...

586
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,820
Into everything.

587
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,000
It pushes you into everything.

588
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,660
No!

589
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,800
Go away!

590
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,860
Go away.

591
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,340
Oh no.

592
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:07,900
Oh no!

593
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,440
No!

594
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,080
Ah!

595
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,240
Ah!

596
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,880
I got my same scores before.

597
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,760
This is Touhou.

598
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,400
My one contact is so...

599
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,260
Making my eyes so dry.

600
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,680
Okay, there we go.

601
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,160
Okay.

602
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:34,880
I think we're good.

603
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,680
We tried.

604
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,160
We get to try the chainsaw.

605
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,800
I'm done.

606
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:46,820
I'm done.

607
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,070
I don't think the chainsaw is the weapon for me, everybody.

608
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:56,650
Let's go, amigo.

609
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:57,650
Let's go!

610
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:58,850
Still go!

611
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,790
I don't think the chainsaw...

612
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,650
I'm done.

613
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:02,690
Thank you forever.

614
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,890
Or maybe any weapon.

615
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,750
Maybe I'm skill issue.

616
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,350
Skill issue something something.

617
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,210
Skill issue something something.

618
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:17,210
Fuck!

619
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:17,930
Fuck!

620
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:18,310
Fuck!

621
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:18,450
Fuck!

622
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,450
Get good and something something.

623
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,430
Wait, am I on hard mode again or am I...

624
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,570
Okay.

625
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,810
Actually, I don't remember.

626
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,230
Did it...

627
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:31,490
No!

628
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:31,770
No!

629
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,330
Chainsaw!

630
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:32,590
No!

631
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,650
I don't like chainsaw!

632
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,180
Oh the... What's it called for that is?

633
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,200
The splash damage is good.

634
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,380
But the reload time is not good.

635
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,880
Skill issue.

636
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,460
Let's go, amigo.

637
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,340
I

638
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,690
got no confidence.

639
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,830
Game over without collecting a single Korone box.

640
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,300
Let's go.

641
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,180
He spawn camped me.

642
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,400
Real.

643
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,620
He spawn camped me in real.

644
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,920
Where did that dog go?

645
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,740
I don't like the chainsaw!

646
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,820
I don't like the chainsaw!

647
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,320
Get me out of here!

648
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,180
No buck either!

649
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,120
Game over!

650
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,230
Roach invasion!

651
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,370
Mint is back!

652
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,090
I'm so happy!

653
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,570
Thanks for the super chat!

654
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,170
Thank you!

655
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:21,900
Get

656
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,990
away from me, Roach!

657
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,510
Get away from me, Roach!

658
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,540
I had everything!

659
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,600
I had nothing!

660
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,040
We

661
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,020
beat my last score!

662
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,540
Josie!

663
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,280
Josie!

664
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,760
Those guys were coming up on me so fast!

665
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,280
I can't even see the bosses!

666
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,860
I am playing it on hard mode.

667
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,720
Okay.

668
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,680
Normal mode.

669
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,440
Normal mode.

670
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,500
Normal mode.

671
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,600
Let's go sunshine, amigo!

672
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,680
I gotta build up my...

673
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,940
I gotta build up my...

674
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,980
My power level.

675
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,080
I wish there was an in-between though.

676
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,520
I feel like maybe...

677
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,680
the normal mode...

678
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,080
Not that it's so easy.

679
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,340
I think I'm just making silly mistakes.

680
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,020
You know what I mean?

681
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,620
This way?

682
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,160
There we go.

683
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,400
Okay.

684
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,150
This way.

685
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,390
Oh.

686
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,080
Egg crystal potato!

687
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,080
Go mint!

688
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,840
Thank you!

689
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:58,720
Oh!

690
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,020
Oh!

691
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,500
Oh my gosh!

692
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,320
So many roaches!

693
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,420
Egg crystal potato!

694
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,620
Egg crystal potato!

695
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:08,640
I

696
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,180
felt like a little bit like a homing...

697
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,020
I felt like a little bit like a homing...

698
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,620
Like a homing...

699
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:17,880
Like a homing...

700
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,660
Danmaku.

701
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,420
Chiba!

702
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:20,780
Chiba!

703
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:20,920
Chiba!

704
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,580
Chiba!

705
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,200
Chiba!

706
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,260
Chiba!

707
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:22,260
Chiba!

708
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:22,980
Chiba!

709
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,290
I'm not good at the...

710
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,190
Oh my gosh.

711
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,630
Why does this feel more difficult than the hard mode?

712
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,050
Okay.

713
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:36,830
Bonk!

714
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,210
Bonk!

715
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,290
No bonk!

716
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,210
No bonk!

717
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,810
Not good at the directional with the...

718
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,190
Bonk hammer.

719
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:45,910
Yubi yubi!

720
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,010
Yubi yubi!

721
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,390
We're already here!

722
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:49,690
Where is he?

723
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:49,970
Ow!

724
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,250
Oh there he is!

725
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,250
I'm die!

726
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,150
Please, I just want to fight the boars.

727
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:11,850
What a way to die.

728
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,130
It was so stupid.

729
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,050
It was actually so dumb.

730
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:15,770
Let's go!

731
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,590
It was actually so stupid.

732
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,830
I don't like the machine gun.

733
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:26,030
Because it pushes you into other...

734
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,170
To other Damakus.

735
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,390
There we go.

736
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:31,610
Yeah, get his butt.

737
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:32,670
Get that guy's butt.

738
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,210
Yeah, get his butt!

739
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,210
Get his butt!

740
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,750
But I'm trying to go this way.

741
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,450
But I'm trying to go this way.

742
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:44,590
Oh!

743
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:45,510
Oh!

744
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,750
I'm die!

745
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:51,810
Thank you forever.

746
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:53,570
I...

747
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,990
You're such a pro gamer Vtuber.

748
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,210
Thanks.

749
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,150
My high score?

750
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,030
11.

751
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,130
What's your high score?

752
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:05,450
200.

753
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,440
Pro gamer?

754
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,080
Nice score!

755
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,010
11 high score.

756
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,330
You know what?

757
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,890
I'm just a huge Stranger Things fan.

758
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,270
You know?

759
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:27,510
Yubi yubi!

760
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,370
Can't really blame me for that.

761
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:31,770
It's just, you know...

762
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,670
I'm just keeping up with the...

763
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,370
Cool Stranger Things lore...

764
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,270
You know...

765
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,490
Hey, good spageto!

766
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,710
Go shirt!

767
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,250
Thank you so much for the 50!

768
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:45,470
Oh.

769
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,970
I shouldn't waste these.

770
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,230
Oh gosh, I shouldn't waste these.

771
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:51,850
Bye dog.

772
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:53,730
Yubi yubi!

773
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,950
Oh my god, not the roaches please.

774
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,810
Not the roaches!

775
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,330
Why are they so fast?

776
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,750
Also wait, does this cut through?

777
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:16,850
Oh it does!

778
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,330
That's kinda nice.

779
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,350
Doesn't help if...

780
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,370
If uh...

781
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,050
They're coming from behind.

782
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:25,710
But...

783
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,890
I don't know what my favorite weapon is yet.

784
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,380
Oh.

785
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,340
Oh wait, should that...

786
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,000
Hand

787
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:57,230
mine?

788
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,800
Wait, how many more...

789
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,360
Weapons do we have?

790
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,640
I was so close to getting the boss again.

791
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,980
Yubi yubi yubi!

792
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,620
Let's go!

793
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,150
Chainsaw!

794
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,270
Nice to meet you!

795
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:18,990
Hopped in to say hi.

796
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,470
Hello!

797
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,890
Thanks for dropping by.

798
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,730
Oh there's still quite a lot actually that we haven't unlocked.

799
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,670
Let's go.

800
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,110
Let's go!

801
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,450
Back to this one actually.

802
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,050
Let's try the...

803
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:35,710
Have confidence!

804
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:39,550
Have confidence she said.

805
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:39,710
Bonk!

806
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,150
Oh!

807
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,190
Egg soup potato!

808
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,750
Bonk!

809
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,310
Bonk!

810
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:51,590
Bonk!

811
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:51,990
Bonk!

812
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,470
Bonk!

813
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,070
Wait is it this way?

814
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:56,630
Nope.

815
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,020
Have a confidence everybody!

816
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,320
Shoot nothing!

817
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,880
Hit everything!

818
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,020
I always lose when it's the chainsaw!

819
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,140
I always lose when it's the chainsaw!

820
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,100
Oh gosh please!

821
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:25,740
Please!

822
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,560
I'll take the bonk!

823
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,620
Just gotta

824
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:41,590
get through here.

825
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,850
Here we go!

826
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,830
Oh I still don't...

827
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,210
I don't know how this one works.

828
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,150
I don't know how this one works.

829
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,510
Wait I'm just gonna leave it.

830
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,530
Wait what do I...

831
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,570
Oh!

832
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,510
That

833
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,820
dog's gonna come here eventually.

834
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:05,780
Wait

835
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,650
actually...

836
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,220
Sometimes it's just bad RNG.

837
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,620
Sometimes...

838
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,600
I don't know what I mean.

839
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,500
Yubi!

840
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,820
Yubi!

841
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,800
Yubi!

842
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,020
Yubi!

843
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,440
Yubi!

844
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:45,580
Yubi!

845
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,620
Listener sign.

846
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,640
Oh no!

847
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:06,870
It's a Yubin time.

848
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,670
I love the...

849
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,610
Oh it's the ping.

850
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,330
Yeah it's the ping.

851
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,490
Something something playing through OBS.

852
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,530
Not really.

853
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,140
That's my favorite opener.

854
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,100
Where's the box?

855
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,920
Oh all the way down there?

856
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,100
It's

857
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,540
always these guys.

858
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,840
They rush you!

859
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,180
They actually rush!

860
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,820
They come in...

861
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,040
Full of confidence.

862
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,760
Oh no!

863
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,680
No no no no no!

864
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,540
No no no!

865
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,500
I'm gonna die.

866
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,190
I'm from the chainsaw!

867
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,980
It doesn't seem like it's a bad weapon.

868
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,360
It's just I think I don't...

869
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,680
I don't know how to properly use it so well.

870
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,720
See like...

871
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,180
There it's pretty good.

872
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,360
You don't need to judge with the chainsaw.

873
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,200
That was so unlucky.

874
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,060
That was so unlucky.

875
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,460
It was so fast.

876
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,540
Right out of there.

877
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,420
Yeah the chainsaw killing bullets is really good.

878
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,360
It is really good, yeah.

879
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,780
Are there achievements?

880
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,280
There are steam achievements, yeah.

881
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,780
I've been getting...

882
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,420
I've been getting some of them.

883
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,640
Like collect...

884
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,560
200 Korone boxes.

885
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,800
Stuff like that.

886
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,690
I thought it would kill him in one hit.

887
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,310
I was wrong.

888
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,070
It's okay, they can stay over there.

889
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,390
In their little...

890
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,190
corner.

891
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:45,810
Get me out of here.

892
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,890
Not the machine gun.

893
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,240
No machine gun.

894
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,100
I don't like the machine gun.

895
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,420
I have to go backwards.

896
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,820
When I use it.

897
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,890
I feel like the machine gun is the worst one.

898
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,370
It's very hard to use.

899
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,210
It's very...

900
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,810
It's very hard to use.

901
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,310
Oh my god, there should...

902
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,550
There should be a leaderboard.

903
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,130
I'd be top.

904
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,310
Mint phantom.

905
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:41,890
Number one.

906
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:43,890
UB collector.

907
00:43:59,010 --> 00:43:59,510
Sorry.

908
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:01,610
Sorry.

909
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:03,790
Okay.

910
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,010
Save.

911
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:07,010
Nice!

912
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,010
They

913
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
charge when they see you.

914
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,080
They charge when they see you.

915
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,160
Can the bullets like...

916
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,540
Trying to get this dope.

917
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,200
This stage is really hard for the...

918
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,340
Cannon also.

919
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,060
No, I...

920
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:56,980
Tried to aim up.

921
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,720
There we go.

922
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:10,790
Are you trying to kill me?

923
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,020
No, I'm trying to go this way.

924
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,000
Please.

925
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,370
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

926
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:32,990
There we go.

927
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:33,070
There we go.

928
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:36,790
Okay, we got...

929
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:37,530
We're getting rid of...

930
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,030
A few of them at least.

931
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:41,190
Let's go around.

932
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:42,670
Okay.

933
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,170
If I can get one more box, we can go against the boss.

934
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:50,790
Are

935
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,150
you kidding?

936
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:00,170
It's always the roaches.

937
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,510
It's always...

938
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,850
It's always the roaches.

939
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,590
Oh my gosh.

940
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,350
Guys, you keep jinxing it.

941
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:08,870
I know.

942
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,050
I'll never get past 11.

943
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:12,750
Have confidence.

944
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:13,730
Oh, thank you.

945
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,270
She's so awesome.

946
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:16,350
She says have confidence.

947
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,790
Get past 11.

948
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,670
All roach bad.

949
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:23,650
True.

950
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,130
Wait.

951
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,630
Not the hand mine.

952
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,730
Wait, can it...

953
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:31,810
Oh, it does explode.

954
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,030
Oh, I got the bonk anyway.

955
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,630
Oh my gosh.

956
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:36,930
Shubha, please.

957
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:38,030
Shubha, please.

958
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,030
Got him before he could come for me.

959
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,370
Nice aim.

960
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:28,870
Thank you.

961
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:31,870
Okay.

962
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:38,730
To explain, I was trying to hit like maybe a wall or something to explode as many as possible.

963
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:39,090
Okay.

964
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:40,530
To explain, I was trying to hit like maybe a wall or something to explode as many as possible.

965
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:41,870
But it just wasn't happening.

966
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,370
But it just wasn't happening.

967
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,130
Who is sending so many?

968
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,510
You.

969
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,480
Nice.

970
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,640
Of the wall.

971
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,500
Of the wall.

972
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,820
Come here, you.

973
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,020
I got

974
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,160
him before it...

975
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,500
I got him before it...

976
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,680
I think she might like the revolver a lot.

977
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,760
No, it's okay.

978
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,520
Explosions from the X potato destroys bullets too, right?

979
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,420
Yes, it seems to be the case.

980
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,280
It seems to be the case.

981
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,700
Revolver is fine.

982
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:57,520
But it's okay, it's not bad.

983
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,340
It's never really... is there like a...

984
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:09,940
Is this a dead end?

985
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,500
Oh my gosh.

986
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,560
It is, yeah.

987
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,260
There's not really a good reason to come down here.

988
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,900
Unless I wanna die by roach!

989
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,140
No please!

990
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:20,740
Oh god!

991
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,910
I don't like the roach!

992
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,730
No roach, no roach!

993
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:48,390
No roach, no roach!

994
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,590
Oh my gosh, please!

995
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,890
Why does it feel like it picks up so much around 5?

996
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,090
Oh my god, please.

997
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:06,950
Okay, there we go.

998
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:07,890
Okay.

999
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:08,870
Bonk!

1000
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:09,470
Bonk!

1001
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:14,230
Bonk has too hard... too long of a cooldown, I feel like.

1002
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:15,570
Oh my god.

1003
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:16,010
No, no, no.

1004
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:17,070
No, no, no.

1005
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,270
He's too...

1006
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:18,670
Oh!

1007
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:19,550
Oh, no!

1008
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,110
Oh, no, no, no!

1009
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:25,270
Oh!

1010
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,270
I was

1011
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,680
doing so well, but also getting nothing.

1012
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,290
The roaches are so crazy.

1013
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,950
Am I getting worse?

1014
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,350
Maybe.

1015
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:26,910
Who knows?

1016
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:29,970
That was the most intense gaming I've ever seen.

1017
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,290
I don't think I was getting worse.

1018
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:33,230
It was just really hard to get around from there.

1019
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:38,970
I think I was getting bad RNG with some of the weapons.

1020
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:42,730
Because the potato cannon is great, but...

1021
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:45,230
But does not help in this level.

1022
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:45,950
Oh my gosh.

1023
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,150
Does not help at all.

1024
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:54,490
Chainsaw!

1025
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,530
Chainsaw wow!

1026
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:59,330
Chainsaw wow, wow, wow.

1027
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:19,850
Up here.

1028
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,180
Okay, nice.

1029
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:37,980
This way.

1030
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:41,880
Okay.

1031
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,720
Yubi yubi yubi yubi.

1032
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,220
Atara is going to hear this and she's going to...

1033
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,360
You know what?

1034
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:05,700
Good.

1035
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,640
Let her hear it.

1036
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,960
I'm destroying her precious...

1037
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,140
Not even...

1038
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,160
The

1039
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,680
best pathetic way to die ever...

1040
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,720
You did that all to yourself.

1041
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,440
I did.

1042
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,660
I did, I did.

1043
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,700
It's always 11.

1044
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,360
I know, I got it hidden.

1045
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,380
I got it hidden.

1046
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,420
Go, Sunshine, amigo!

1047
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,240
Sunshine!

1048
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,000
Sunshine!

1049
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:46,900
If I

1050
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:52,130
put one down, and then another...

1051
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:53,990
Oh, interesting.

1052
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:54,550
Okay.

1053
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,710
So I should just start putting them down everywhere.

1054
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:58,370
Yubi yubi!

1055
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,520
Oh, I can shoot now.

1056
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,280
I can shoot now.

1057
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:21,930
Chainsaw...

1058
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:22,650
Yubi yubi!

1059
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:23,430
Bunk!

1060
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:24,430
Bunk, bunk, bunk!

1061
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:25,230
This way.

1062
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,400
Bunk this way!

1063
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,000
Bunk...

1064
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,240
This way!

1065
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,380
Bunk this way!

1066
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,200
Yeah!

1067
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,360
Hit everything and nothing!

1068
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,340
Hit everything and...

1069
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,160
Oh, that was close.

1070
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:47,720
That was close.

1071
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,180
That was close.

1072
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:49,860
No,

1073
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:02,460
no, no, no.

1074
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,060
Not machine gun.

1075
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:03,620
Not machine gun.

1076
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:04,740
Please, no.

1077
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,280
Please, no!

1078
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,120
Not machine gun!

1079
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:06,940
Not machine gun!

1080
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:13,800
Nice!

1081
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:14,820
Sorry.

1082
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,960
I shouldn't... I shouldn't...

1083
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:17,880
Maybe...

1084
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,180
Are you kidding me?!

1085
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,000
Um...

1086
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:27,940
I'm done.

1087
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:28,820
Thank you for...

1088
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:29,400
There's no way!

1089
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,100
There's no way I could have fought the boss with...

1090
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,800
With the hand mines!

1091
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,240
There's no way!

1092
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,320
That RNG was so bad.

1093
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,420
Worst weapon for the boss.

1094
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,540
That was so bad.

1095
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,680
We got there so quickly too.

1096
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,320
Ghost!

1097
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,280
Bunk!

1098
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:54,740
Bunk!

1099
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:04,940
Sorry, man.

1100
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:05,460
It's okay.

1101
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:05,540
It's okay.

1102
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,120
I'm having fun.

1103
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:13,850
Oh, this way.

1104
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,840
That's part of the game, you know?

1105
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,300
Is you just...

1106
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,300
Try and try and try and try and try again.

1107
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,400
It's one of those fast-paced games, you know?

1108
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:40,570
Wait.

1109
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:40,890
Wait.

1110
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:41,530
Oh, it's this way.

1111
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,080
Oh my god.

1112
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:46,820
No, no, no, no, no!

1113
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:49,300
Nice.

1114
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:49,720
Okay.

1115
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:50,960
That was close.

1116
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,660
That was a close one.

1117
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:56,300
It can kind of help launch you where you need to go.

1118
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,860
But also, it's not...

1119
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,320
Not easy.

1120
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,740
Oh, shoot.

1121
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:09,670
We're so close.

1122
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,330
It's very addicting for sure.

1123
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,130
Quick reset is a lot of fun.

1124
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,370
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

1125
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:17,630
I have...

1126
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:17,930
I have...

1127
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:18,710
I have...

1128
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:20,130
I have...

1129
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:24,070
I have...

1130
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,040
The curse is broken.

1131
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,880
You didn't get 11 this time.

1132
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:34,660
Let's go, Sunshine!

1133
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,260
Amigo!

1134
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:35,340
Sunshine!

1135
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:35,800
Yeah, we got...

1136
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,080
We got worse!

1137
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,220
We didn't get 11.

1138
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:40,780
We got worse!

1139
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:42,800
Listener sign.

1140
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,000
Putting you out of your misery.

1141
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,240
We're gonna...

1142
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,600
Oh my gosh.

1143
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,080
Shotgun.

1144
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,020
Yubi yubi!

1145
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:11,540
Uh

1146
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:28,230
oh.

1147
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:28,730
Uh oh.

1148
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:29,030
Uh oh.

1149
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:29,290
Uh oh.

1150
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:29,350
Uh oh.

1151
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:34,840
Oh my god.

1152
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:35,900
I got hit too.

1153
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,260
Nice!

1154
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,080
Not nice.

1155
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,580
Not nice.

1156
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,220
I need to go.

1157
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,700
I'm learning more how to control this.

1158
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,540
I'm learning more how to control it...

1159
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,700
I think.

1160
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,440
Shotgun!

1161
00:58:59,320 --> 00:58:59,600
I...

1162
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:12,490
Shit!

1163
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:12,870
Ah!

1164
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:13,290
I am so sorry!

1165
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:13,730
I am so sorry!

1166
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,440
Shuba sniped.

1167
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,280
No confidence, no confidence.

1168
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,580
We're never gonna beat a boss.

1169
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:30,980
We will!

1170
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,780
The stream will end until we beat a boss.

1171
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,520
Actually, I am gonna switch to...

1172
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,560
We gotta unlock a new weapon.

1173
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,980
Let's switch to this place.

1174
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,640
I think this one is easier for the cannon.

1175
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:34,470
Sometimes, I'll be honest, the arrow pointing towards the next box makes me feel like that's where I'm pointing at.

1176
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:40,310
So if you see me making a mistake like that, that's exactly what I'm thinking.

1177
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:46,390
I'm looking at the arrow as if it's where I'm pointing my weapon.

1178
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:50,370
Because my brain is silly.

1179
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:59,240
Maybe this map isn't as good.

1180
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,680
Maybe this map is really difficult.

1181
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,320
Eleven seems to be your lucky number.

1182
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,460
Thank you.

1183
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:13,120
Thank you for the eleven eleven.

1184
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,440
Oh my god.

1185
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,860
Everyone play the lottery.

1186
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,800
Play the lottery.

1187
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,940
Use eleven.

1188
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,380
This isn't fair.

1189
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,380
Okay,

1190
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:39,750
I won.

1191
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:40,290
This is my luck.

1192
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:43,970
Ah, this is my luck.

1193
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:45,710
Don't be fooled.

1194
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,050
Playing at the top is kinda tough.

1195
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:48,170
No,

1196
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:55,330
I'm not sure I am.

1197
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,430
I'm just celebrating 10 years of being a youtuber.

1198
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:57,690
I think I'm gonna win.

1199
01:01:58,450 --> 01:01:58,570
So?

1200
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,110
I don't know.

1201
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:01,410
But it's hard to say.

1202
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:01,730
I'm sure I will win.

1203
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:10,440
I did not shoot.

1204
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:14,940
Listener-san, please.

1205
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,940
Why would you treat your Oshii like this?

1206
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:23,080
They know I'm a phony.

1207
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,200
They know I'm a phony.

1208
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:31,380
Maybe this one is actually more difficult because it's a little bit more open!

1209
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:31,700
Open!

1210
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:34,540
Hug

1211
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:42,760
me!

1212
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,120
Hug me!

1213
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:43,480
Hug me!

1214
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:43,820
Hug me!

1215
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,340
Get out of my way!

1216
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:51,710
Power, please!

1217
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:54,710
Okay.

1218
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:55,070
Okay.

1219
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:55,890
Okay.

1220
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:56,410
Okay.

1221
01:02:56,650 --> 01:03:00,830
Not exactly what I was thinking, but...

1222
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:05,770
This will maybe do the trick.

1223
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:10,290
Oh, I don't think I got it.

1224
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,010
Why are you so fast?

1225
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:32,490
Just circle!

1226
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,780
Could be worse.

1227
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,360
Could be way worse.

1228
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,240
Could be way worse.

1229
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,160
The dogs just run through...

1230
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:46,560
Oh my god.

1231
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,420
Oh my god.

1232
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:48,420
Oh my god.

1233
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,960
The dogs just run through the chainsaw.

1234
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,320
It's crazy.

1235
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:06,370
I'm so concentrated right now, you guys.

1236
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:07,170
You have no idea.

1237
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,030
Why?

1238
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:10,370
Why?

1239
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:12,310
Why bonk?

1240
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,150
Okay, where's the... where's the...

1241
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:20,390
Where's the guy?

1242
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:21,910
Oh, you think he's down here?

1243
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:25,350
This is not easy.

1244
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:33,170
And we hide behind the trees.

1245
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,100
Wait, I can also bonk these back, right?

1246
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:39,340
Ah!

1247
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,500
I should've bonked them... bonked the back.

1248
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,620
At least you can deflect the bullets, or not.

1249
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,540
Let's go!

1250
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:00,280
Yeah.

1251
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:01,500
Let's go!

1252
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:02,720
Come on, Korone.

1253
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,460
We got this.

1254
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,360
She's like, I've got this.

1255
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:05,980
You!

1256
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:08,820
On the other hand...

1257
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:11,460
That is questionable.

1258
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,860
Whether you've got this or...

1259
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:25,810
Oh, nice.

1260
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,290
Get... get mined.

1261
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:31,170
Oh god.

1262
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:32,050
Yeah.

1263
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:33,590
Nice, nice, nice.

1264
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:39,690
I didn't see you there.

1265
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:41,750
Shotgun.

1266
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,640
Next one down here.

1267
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,340
Where?

1268
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:02,860
Here?

1269
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,480
Nice!

1270
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:04,820
Done!

1271
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,400
I like the hand mine, actually.

1272
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,580
It has a slow...

1273
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:15,160
It has a slow recharge, but I like being able to control it, too.

1274
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,660
Let's go, sunshine amigo.

1275
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,520
I got a frisbee!

1276
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,600
Let's go, amigo!

1277
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,280
Wait, we unlocked something else!

1278
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:23,580
Wait.

1279
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:24,760
Yubi yubi!

1280
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,060
Let's see if we get it.

1281
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:26,840
Let's see if we get it.

1282
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,040
Frisbee, frisbee.

1283
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:30,820
Bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk.

1284
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,040
Bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk.

1285
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:34,020
Yubi yubi!

1286
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:35,200
Nice!

1287
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,000
Oh, she says janken because it's the hand.

1288
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:46,860
It's cute.

1289
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,040
That saved me.

1290
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,460
That saved me for real!

1291
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:01,980
I like that the mines also stay.

1292
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,340
They stay, too, which is nice.

1293
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,220
So I can set them up everywhere and then...

1294
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:08,700
Nice!

1295
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,500
Bonk, bonk!

1296
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,160
Wait!

1297
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,000
Joshi!

1298
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,120
Oh, oh!

1299
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:16,600
Yeah!

1300
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:16,940
Yeah!

1301
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,640
Okay, we also can do those.

1302
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,860
Maybe if I just loop these.

1303
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:35,750
Okay, nice.

1304
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:37,130
Good job, guys!

1305
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:44,170
Frisbee!

1306
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:54,490
We did it!

1307
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:55,930
We did it!

1308
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:56,590
We did it!

1309
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:57,030
We did it!

1310
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:57,570
We did it!

1311
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:57,870
No!

1312
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,080
You can die by the frisbee.

1313
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:12,310
You can die by the frisbee.

1314
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,170
That's how I died.

1315
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:18,450
I got an achievement called get hit by the frisbee.

1316
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:20,470
A

1317
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,460
bone meringue.

1318
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,680
The frisbee sucks.

1319
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:41,380
You can also right click to reflect it.

1320
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:41,600
Oh!

1321
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,340
Still congratulations, man.

1322
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:49,920
Thank you.

1323
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:51,320
Yippee!

1324
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:53,280
Thank you for the five.

1325
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:53,820
Get the ducky.

1326
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:54,360
Thank you!

1327
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:02,310
I was sending them out like crazy, too.

1328
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:04,470
Okay, though.

1329
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:05,110
That's not fair.

1330
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:07,970
If you can't get hit by the revolver's bullets...

1331
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:08,290
I'm stuck!

1332
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:11,310
You shouldn't be able to get hit by the frisbee, either.

1333
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:12,090
Oh, my God.

1334
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:13,010
Not already.

1335
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:14,450
Get out of my face.

1336
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,450
Look at that!

1337
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:16,570
Wow, wow, wow!

1338
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:17,930
Wow, wow, wow.

1339
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:19,110
I want to try the frisbee.

1340
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:19,690
Oh, my God.

1341
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,400
This is just...

1342
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:31,480
But I do want to try it, also.

1343
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,540
Think I got them this time.

1344
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:40,420
Okay.

1345
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:55,370
That was close.

1346
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:56,130
That was a close one.

1347
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:57,610
Please!

1348
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:05,370
They're so aggressive!

1349
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:07,590
They're so aggressive.

1350
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:08,250
They're so aggressive.

1351
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:10,270
Ah, my aim.

1352
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:16,870
I'm hoping... I'm like... spraying a little bit and praying that the splash damage gets them.

1353
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:20,270
Oh my god.

1354
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:20,930
Oh my god.

1355
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:21,610
Oh my god.

1356
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:21,790
Oh my god.

1357
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:21,910
Oh my god.

1358
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:22,930
Oh my god.

1359
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:23,270
Oh my god.

1360
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:52,020
I'm just... I'm just placing them down.

1361
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,260
For Josie.

1362
01:10:58,340 --> 01:10:58,680
Okay.

1363
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,920
This is the guy we did before.

1364
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,740
Go away, roaches!

1365
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:04,220
Go away!

1366
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:05,260
Go away!

1367
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,420
Wait, if I just do this...

1368
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:08,900
Oh my gosh.

1369
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:09,300
Oh my gosh.

1370
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:11,960
If I just do this, it's not so bad, right?

1371
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:12,440
Actually.

1372
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,280
It's actually kind of awesome.

1373
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:23,430
Oh, okay.

1374
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:23,730
Okay.

1375
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:24,890
Okay.

1376
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:25,690
Okay.

1377
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:27,070
Okay.

1378
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:28,470
Do I get it back or...

1379
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:31,170
So

1380
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:37,550
close.

1381
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:39,390
Starting to believe.

1382
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:44,010
Right click for three at once.

1383
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:44,310
Oh!

1384
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,950
I keep forgetting to right click on these weapons.

1385
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:55,130
Like I do it on this one because it... Instead of like doing the side by side, you do the one direction.

1386
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:57,330
No.

1387
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:58,270
No, no, no, no, no.

1388
01:11:58,890 --> 01:11:59,210
No.

1389
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:00,190
No, no, no.

1390
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:01,230
No, no, no.

1391
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:03,650
Bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk.

1392
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:04,810
I'll take a bonk.

1393
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:05,330
I'll take a bonk.

1394
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:05,810
I'll take a bonk.

1395
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:23,170
Recharge.

1396
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:25,770
So I'm not sure how...

1397
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:29,410
I see.

1398
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:31,310
I see.

1399
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:33,330
What if I right click on this one?

1400
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:33,950
Is it the same?

1401
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:37,150
I can't tell actually.

1402
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:05,700
I inhaled so fast that I choked on my spit.

1403
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:08,840
Don't die.

1404
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:09,520
I'm already dead.

1405
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:11,700
Dang.

1406
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,480
These are all like right next to each other.

1407
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,140
We're already at six.

1408
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,240
I don't even need to...

1409
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:35,580
Machine

1410
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:48,530
gun.

1411
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:49,530
Machine gun.

1412
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:52,530
Oh my god.

1413
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,660
Oh, okay.

1414
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:04,540
Oh my god.

1415
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:05,180
Oh

1416
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:23,510
my god.

1417
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:24,210
No, Shuba.

1418
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:24,650
Please.

1419
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:25,390
Shuba.

1420
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:27,990
How am I supposed to beat him with the hammer?

1421
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,100
Lure him.

1422
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,160
I didn't even get a single hit on it.

1423
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:54,440
Oh, there.

1424
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,320
Let's go sunshine, amigo.

1425
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,020
Sunshine.

1426
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:00,500
Back to eleven.

1427
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,120
Eleven curse.

1428
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:07,500
This game is tricky though.

1429
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:08,640
It's fun but...

1430
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:11,880
Also me bad.

1431
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:12,560
But that's okay.

1432
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:15,620
I like

1433
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:19,700
the hand mine.

1434
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,840
It's just not good if we're...

1435
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,560
Stuffed quick.

1436
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:23,740
Or for...

1437
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:24,940
Yeah.

1438
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:27,580
Situations where you need to be firing a lot and fast.

1439
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:35,770
Wait.

1440
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:36,370
Oh, it's this way.

1441
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:37,030
Why am I going?

1442
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:38,510
Why am I going down?

1443
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:48,870
Stop.

1444
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:49,350
Okay.

1445
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:53,410
Die.

1446
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:53,890
Die.

1447
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:54,510
Die.

1448
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:55,930
Die.

1449
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:56,610
Die.

1450
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:56,810
Die.

1451
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:57,110
Die.

1452
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:57,310
Die.

1453
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:07,700
Please.

1454
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:07,940
Please bounce.

1455
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:08,560
Die.

1456
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:08,880
Die.

1457
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:09,240
Die.

1458
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:09,480
Die.

1459
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:09,740
Die.

1460
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:10,140
Die.

1461
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:10,460
Die.

1462
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,880
Listener-san, so small and so easy to miss.

1463
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,060
Where is it?

1464
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:30,580
Oh, this way.

1465
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:40,440
Okay.

1466
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:40,920
Okay.

1467
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:44,420
What the?

1468
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:45,580
What is this?

1469
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,440
Pinky pledge.

1470
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:56,450
The terror.

1471
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:57,870
I don't like bugs.

1472
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:01,750
I hate that one so much.

1473
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:02,510
Yeah.

1474
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:05,150
I didn't know what that one did.

1475
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:07,430
So I was just running to see if...

1476
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:07,690
Okay.

1477
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:08,030
That's okay.

1478
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:08,430
That's okay.

1479
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:08,770
That's okay.

1480
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,480
It's like racing spell card.

1481
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:19,660
I'm a dog.

1482
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,400
Not the actual Touhou.

1483
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,280
Yumi.

1484
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:22,520
Yumi.

1485
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,580
I haven't played Imperishable Night.

1486
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:26,760
I don't even know.

1487
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,200
Actually, I'll be honest.

1488
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,720
I probably have played Imperishable Night the least.

1489
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,280
This wasn't one of my favorites.

1490
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,160
Which is okay.

1491
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,200
I don't know what the...

1492
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:51,040
It's hard to say or it's hard for me to figure out what the...

1493
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:51,980
Oh my god.

1494
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:52,360
Oh my god.

1495
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:52,780
Oh my god.

1496
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,560
How big the splash damage is on the mines.

1497
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:57,820
Bunk.

1498
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:58,300
Bunk.

1499
01:17:58,920 --> 01:17:59,700
There we go.

1500
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,760
Take that guy out real fast.

1501
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:06,940
Shoot the gun.

1502
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:10,840
Imperishable Night is peak.

1503
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,280
It's good.

1504
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,400
It's just not one of my favorites.

1505
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,000
I played Mountain of Faith.

1506
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,360
Must.

1507
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,320
And Hello?

1508
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:20,980
Hello?

1509
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,040
Hello.

1510
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:25,440
Imperishable Night.

1511
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,240
And...

1512
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:28,720
Oh no, no.

1513
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:32,630
Oh my god.

1514
01:18:32,650 --> 01:18:33,310
How did I live?

1515
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:34,630
How am I alive?

1516
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:45,240
There was one other one.

1517
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:49,240
I played UFO quite a bit.

1518
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,860
Let's go sunshine, Amigo.

1519
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:52,500
Sunshine.

1520
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,360
And...

1521
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,320
USD, obviously.

1522
01:18:59,020 --> 01:18:59,980
No frisbee.

1523
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:00,600
No frisbee.

1524
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:01,460
No frisbee.

1525
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,040
No frisbee.

1526
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,680
Oh god, I'm scared of the frisbee.

1527
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:08,780
I'm scared of the frisbee.

1528
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,720
It's gonna get me.

1529
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,860
There's one that I'm... cannot...

1530
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:24,880
I don't know why I can't think of which one.

1531
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:39,430
My brain is only consumed by Yubi.

1532
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,530
I'm Yubi-brained right now.

1533
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:44,850
There's a potato.

1534
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:45,170
Tango.

1535
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:47,810
The overkill.

1536
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:49,210
You know what?

1537
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:49,850
It's not overkill.

1538
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:50,830
These guys are annoying.

1539
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:53,830
These guys, these tiny little guys...

1540
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:56,750
are pain in my side.

1541
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:00,170
Pain in my side.

1542
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:01,950
Oh my god.

1543
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:04,170
Oh my god.

1544
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:04,450
Hello?

1545
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:05,110
Hello?

1546
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:11,850
No, Shuba.

1547
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:13,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1548
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:15,710
Shuba, no!

1549
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:18,490
I just hear her go Shuba, Shuba, Shuba.

1550
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:24,720
Trying to take some of these other guys out.

1551
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:26,100
Oh my god.

1552
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:28,100
Shuba, Shuba, Shuba.

1553
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:30,660
Maybe in like here.

1554
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:31,740
Okay, here we go.

1555
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,360
Okay, nice.

1556
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:36,620
Nice, nice.

1557
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:37,800
Take him out.

1558
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,000
Oh, no.

1559
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:39,600
Never mind.

1560
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1561
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:42,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1562
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:43,880
Oh!

1563
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:44,240
Oh!

1564
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:53,060
Help me!

1565
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:53,840
Oh my god.

1566
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:54,820
Oh my god.

1567
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:55,980
That was a close one.

1568
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,080
That was a close one.

1569
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:58,620
Oh my god.

1570
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:00,820
I'm in danger.

1571
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:01,420
I'm in danger.

1572
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,240
I'm in danger, you guys.

1573
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,300
I'm in danger.

1574
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:06,380
I'm in danger.

1575
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:06,920
I'm in danger.

1576
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:07,400
I'm in danger.

1577
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:08,320
I'm in danger.

1578
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:08,960
I'm in danger.

1579
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,400
Help me.

1580
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:11,200
Help.

1581
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,120
Help me.

1582
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:21,660
Nice.

1583
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:25,280
Oh my god.

1584
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,620
Screw you!

1585
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:29,100
Little roach.

1586
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:32,380
Sorry dog.

1587
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,700
Oh my god, that did not kill dog.

1588
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,800
That did not finish off the dog.

1589
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,520
Well, let Shuba do her thing over there.

1590
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,420
Where is... Oh my god.

1591
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,440
Oh my god, there's so many people!

1592
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,660
Please, I'm an introvert!

1593
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,460
Please, I'm an introvert!

1594
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,360
I don't want to talk to anyone!

1595
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:01,690
Okay, okay, okay.

1596
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,400
Too real.

1597
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:14,660
I

1598
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,640
only count up to 14, you guys.

1599
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,420
This is intense.

1600
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,040
I don't think... You know what?

1601
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,520
I intended on this being a short stream anyway.

1602
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,420
Because I just wanted to, you know, hang out a little bit today.

1603
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:35,460
But I don't think I can physically handle the amount of stress this game gives me.

1604
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,700
For so long.

1605
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:42,220
Keep

1606
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:48,490
playing.

1607
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:50,630
Thank you for the 50.

1608
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:51,110
Thank you.

1609
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:56,990
No, we're still gonna go.

1610
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:00,170
I'm not done yet.

1611
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:02,850
I'm having fun.

1612
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:04,130
It's just terrifying.

1613
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:10,410
It's a fun terrifying.

1614
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:11,310
Right?

1615
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:13,570
I'm scared.

1616
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:16,310
And also...

1617
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:18,850
Like these guys.

1618
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:21,670
Oh, my God.

1619
01:23:26,930 --> 01:23:28,370
Oh, Shubaaaaaa!

1620
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:39,350
There it is.

1621
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:40,690
I

1622
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:51,230
ran right into it.

1623
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:56,110
Why?

1624
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:01,410
Why am I so bad in this game?

1625
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:01,630
I'm scared.

1626
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:03,010
No confidence.

1627
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:07,150
I saw someone say they got a score of 30.

1628
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:08,970
I'm half way there, almost.

1629
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:11,810
I'm almost half way there.

1630
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:14,950
I'm almost half way there.

1631
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:16,070
Hello?

1632
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:16,690
It's a dog.

1633
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:17,310
It's a dog.

1634
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:17,890
It's a dog.

1635
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:26,420
That was scary.

1636
01:24:34,230 --> 01:24:34,770
This way.

1637
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:37,990
There we go.

1638
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:42,290
I got 30 and I'm like the...

1639
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:43,930
neon cannon.

1640
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:45,690
What's that?

1641
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:46,050
Wait.

1642
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:46,890
I want a cannon.

1643
01:24:47,010 --> 01:24:47,390
What's that?

1644
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:48,830
What's it do?

1645
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:50,930
I want that.

1646
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:57,890
This is just definitely something I can see myself like playing and you know.

1647
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:03,690
And like oh I have a... well I was gonna say when I have a free extra couple of minutes.

1648
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:05,090
That's quite rare.

1649
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:08,290
But uh...

1650
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:11,330
Frisbee please.

1651
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:12,050
Frisbee.

1652
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:16,150
It'd be fun if the...

1653
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:17,890
if the dog chased after the frisbee.

1654
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:23,610
Can you move?

1655
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:24,450
No!

1656
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:27,390
I need to get to the box!

1657
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:28,870
Where is it?

1658
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:33,900
Stop chasing after my...

1659
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,280
Why are you so obsessed with me?

1660
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:37,800
There we go.

1661
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,180
Okay.

1662
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,160
Okay, okay.

1663
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:43,340
Okay, okay.

1664
01:25:57,170 --> 01:25:57,670
Defense!

1665
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:05,500
That was absolutely 100% me.

1666
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,140
That was 100% me being greedy.

1667
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:09,600
What's wrong with me?

1668
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,140
Why did I do that?

1669
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,780
That was me being greedy.

1670
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:14,360
My greed.

1671
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:16,480
Don't be greedy.

1672
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:17,800
Oh my gosh Mei Ling told me.

1673
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,840
Okay I'm gonna pretend you guys aren't here.

1674
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:25,680
Okay sorry.

1675
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,420
I'm gonna pretend you guys...

1676
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:29,740
don't even exist.

1677
01:26:39,850 --> 01:26:40,570
Concentration.

1678
01:28:43,210 --> 01:28:44,410
I didn't see it.

1679
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:46,390
I didn't see it!

1680
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:49,570
I didn't see it.

1681
01:28:50,770 --> 01:28:51,890
Dang it.

1682
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:55,750
It's okay though.

1683
01:28:57,450 --> 01:28:58,610
Forever 19!

1684
01:28:59,210 --> 01:28:59,690
Woo!

1685
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:05,450
You're pretty good.

1686
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:07,490
Just blame it on us.

1687
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:08,430
Say you peaked.

1688
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:08,690
Okay.

1689
01:29:09,730 --> 01:29:11,370
I missed you guys a little bit.

1690
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:12,950
So I just...

1691
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:15,250
had to make sure you were okay.

1692
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:18,310
You were locked in there for a minute.

1693
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:23,450
There were some parts that I got really lucky.

1694
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:27,930
There were some parts though that I got really lucky.

1695
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:30,430
That I shouldn't have won I think.

1696
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:31,710
Nice focus run.

1697
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:32,150
Thank you!

1698
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:34,750
Thank you.

1699
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:35,810
See?

1700
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:37,910
If I pretend I'm not streaming.

1701
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:39,750
It's a little...

1702
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,110
See I can do alright.

1703
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:42,130
I can do a little bit better.

1704
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:43,790
See performance anxiety is a real thing.

1705
01:29:46,670 --> 01:29:48,330
It was great watching your faces.

1706
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:49,370
You got certain weapons ready.

1707
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:52,650
Welcome to membership.

1708
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:53,490
Thank you.

1709
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:54,270
Oh my gosh.

1710
01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:56,190
My left contact.

1711
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:00,190
I mean my right contact.

1712
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:00,350
I mean my right contact.

1713
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:01,690
Ah!

1714
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:04,250
It's so...

1715
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:05,130
Ah!

1716
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:07,610
Ah!

1717
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:10,470
It's so...

1718
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:12,210
It's acting up so weird today.

1719
01:30:14,230 --> 01:30:15,710
I don't know what's up with it.

1720
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:18,550
We haven't done the first stage in a while.

1721
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:19,250
We haven't done the first stage in a while.

1722
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:21,990
I will go back to it after this round.

1723
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:25,550
Though I do think this is my favorite.

1724
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:25,830
Though I do think this is my favorite.

1725
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:28,350
It's not the easiest.

1726
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:29,690
But I like it.

1727
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:31,170
You can hang out too!

1728
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:47,030
Chainsaw!

1729
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:50,170
Hello?

1730
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:51,330
Fuck!

1731
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:54,510
Fuck!

1732
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:54,650
Fuck!

1733
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:54,850
Fuck!

1734
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:56,090
That was good timing.

1735
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:02,860
No I don't wear glasses.

1736
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:03,820
Ever.

1737
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,900
I absolutely...

1738
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:08,680
hate...

1739
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,320
glasses on me.

1740
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:12,920
Especially because...

1741
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:16,120
wearing them with the...

1742
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:16,380
wearing them with the...

1743
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:17,680
headset...

1744
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:20,640
digs into my ears and gives me really bad...

1745
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,420
headaches.

1746
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:23,200
So...

1747
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,820
I don't...

1748
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:27,180
wear them.

1749
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:30,280
Oh that was fast.

1750
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:31,060
Oh!

1751
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:31,460
Oh!

1752
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:31,740
Oh!

1753
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:33,500
I...

1754
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,580
I shot myself into the dog.

1755
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:40,360
I shot myself into the dog.

1756
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:42,180
Yeah.

1757
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:45,400
I started wearing earbuds for that reason.

1758
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:45,860
Yeah.

1759
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:46,320
Yeah.

1760
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:46,940
Makes sense.

1761
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:47,200
Right?

1762
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:52,320
I like the look of them but they are so annoying to wear.

1763
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:52,960
Right!

1764
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:54,860
Yeah I like the look of them.

1765
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:56,880
Well actually I don't really particularly like...

1766
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:57,680
how they look on me.

1767
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,640
I like how they look on other people.

1768
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:02,840
Chainsaw!

1769
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,260
Or maybe that...

1770
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,980
Oh wait sorry I forgot to go to the other stage.

1771
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:08,860
Maybe that's just me.

1772
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:09,820
Um...

1773
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,320
Like... What's the word?

1774
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:13,980
Um...

1775
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:16,060
Trying to make it so I don't like them.

1776
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:19,340
So that I don't want to wear them.

1777
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:19,920
You know what I mean?

1778
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:21,340
Oh that was up.

1779
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,360
Why am I so silly?

1780
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:24,180
Bye bye!

1781
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:32,760
Get out of here.

1782
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:33,480
Oh!

1783
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:35,380
That was...

1784
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:37,000
Oh my gosh.

1785
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:40,500
That was so stupid...

1786
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,140
lucky.

1787
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:43,660
Shiba!

1788
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:45,160
Shiba!

1789
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:46,420
Shiba!

1790
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:47,040
Shiba!

1791
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:50,000
Okay I can leave.

1792
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:55,190
Oops.

1793
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:56,790
Oops!

1794
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:58,670
Oops!

1795
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:02,710
Oops!

1796
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:07,510
Bank!

1797
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:08,590
Bank!

1798
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:15,700
No first base.

1799
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:16,240
Bank!

1800
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:23,770
Okay.

1801
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:26,630
Maybe...

1802
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:29,550
Oh not the worst for...

1803
01:33:30,370 --> 01:33:31,470
Where is he?

1804
01:33:32,170 --> 01:33:32,850
Oh!

1805
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:33,850
Oh!

1806
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:40,380
Oh my

1807
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:48,530
god.

1808
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:49,190
Not the roaches.

1809
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:50,110
Please not the roaches.

1810
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:52,770
Not the roaches!

1811
01:33:53,370 --> 01:33:57,470
Not the roaches!

1812
01:33:57,470 --> 01:33:58,190
Go away!

1813
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:01,550
Go away!

1814
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,280
I can't get the roaches.

1815
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:07,520
Where are they?

1816
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,680
Where's the pinky monster?

1817
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:12,720
Where's the pinky monster?

1818
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:12,980
Let's go!

1819
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:15,660
There.

1820
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:17,880
There we go.

1821
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:21,160
Man.

1822
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:06,370
I jinxed it.

1823
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:08,310
She's getting good.

1824
01:35:08,490 --> 01:35:09,030
Stop!

1825
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:10,810
What do you mean?

1826
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:15,650
What do you mean?

1827
01:35:17,950 --> 01:35:19,670
Yeah you did jinx it though.

1828
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:21,810
It's always... Oh my gosh.

1829
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:22,070
Ouch.

1830
01:35:22,330 --> 01:35:23,070
Oh god.

1831
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:23,690
My contacts.

1832
01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:25,170
It's like... I think it's just dry.

1833
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:27,650
I'm a dog!

1834
01:35:28,150 --> 01:35:29,810
Oops I forgot to change those.

1835
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:35,450
It's because I'm not blinking.

1836
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:39,970
Why did I almost...

1837
01:35:41,490 --> 01:35:43,890
Walk into that guy like I thought he was a box?

1838
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:45,970
That would have been crazy.

1839
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:49,870
If I just walked into that guy like I thought he was a box...

1840
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:51,890
If I just walked into that guy like I thought he was a box...

1841
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:51,970
Whoa!

1842
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:52,330
Whoa!

1843
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,360
Keep placing them around...

1844
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:00,780
Um...

1845
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:02,480
Where they spawn.

1846
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,500
Hydration check.

1847
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:17,960
Yes!

1848
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,200
I will hydrate!

1849
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:20,820
Yes!

1850
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:21,340
I will hydrate!

1851
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:26,980
Yuppie!

1852
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:27,400
Yuppie!

1853
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:27,940
Yuppie!

1854
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:28,140
Yuppie!

1855
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:28,240
Yuppie!

1856
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:28,300
Yuppie!

1857
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:28,300
Yuppie!

1858
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:28,300
Yuppie!

1859
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:29,020
Oh.

1860
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:41,390
Joshi again.

1861
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:50,360
That's okay.

1862
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:51,980
Because we were gonna do this anyway.

1863
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,460
Bread box!

1864
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:11,130
I hear him.

1865
01:37:11,770 --> 01:37:12,470
Where are you?

1866
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:15,910
Where are you?

1867
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:32,630
It's weird not being used to this...

1868
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:33,610
Stage!

1869
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:36,270
Oh my god.

1870
01:37:36,270 --> 01:37:36,470
Please.

1871
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:40,710
I have an itch.

1872
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:42,110
Don't... don't spawn.

1873
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:42,810
Okay.

1874
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:43,030
Thank you.

1875
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:09,000
That also requires me to...

1876
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:09,560
Oh my god.

1877
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:11,780
Be...

1878
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:14,320
Oh my gosh.

1879
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:14,800
Oh my gosh.

1880
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:15,560
Oh my gosh!

1881
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:17,740
Whoa!

1882
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:18,160
Whoa!

1883
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:18,520
Whoa!

1884
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:20,700
There's so many people!

1885
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,480
An extrovert.

1886
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:25,660
Is what I was trying to say.

1887
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:29,320
Did you hear that?

1888
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:31,280
Did you hear that?

1889
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,100
The box is...

1890
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:48,860
Oh my god.

1891
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,800
Why does this stage feel the most crowded as possible?

1892
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,640
And those guys are so fast.

1893
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:55,360
Let's go!

1894
01:39:12,170 --> 01:39:12,810
Pinkie again!

1895
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:14,090
Oh.

1896
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:14,810
Oh my god.

1897
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:15,430
Oh my god.

1898
01:39:16,610 --> 01:39:17,410
That was...

1899
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:20,530
How am I alive?

1900
01:39:22,850 --> 01:39:24,590
Actually, I have no idea how I'm alive right now.

1901
01:39:25,530 --> 01:39:26,570
I should have died.

1902
01:39:27,110 --> 01:39:28,070
I should have died.

1903
01:39:28,850 --> 01:39:29,890
I should have died.

1904
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:30,530
I should have died.

1905
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:31,090
I should have died.

1906
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:31,590
I should have died.

1907
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:32,130
I should have died.

1908
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:33,190
I should have died.

1909
01:39:38,090 --> 01:39:39,890
What is my hitbox anyway?

1910
01:39:41,090 --> 01:39:42,530
What even is my hitbox?

1911
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:48,400
How did I hit it?

1912
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:50,740
Very tiny.

1913
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:52,520
It clearly is very tiny.

1914
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,540
If I press shift, will I see it?

1915
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:03,330
That wasn't maybe the best weapon.

1916
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:05,650
Well, it was good, but also...

1917
01:40:05,650 --> 01:40:06,810
Let's go, amigo!

1918
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:08,030
Let's go!

1919
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:08,470
Not so...

1920
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:09,750
Easy for me.

1921
01:40:10,330 --> 01:40:11,830
I hate frisbees.

1922
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:12,630
No frisbee.

1923
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:14,590
No frisbee.

1924
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:16,010
No frisbee.

1925
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:21,670
Yeah, it's not great for bosses.

1926
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:22,510
Yeah, that's for sure.

1927
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:23,490
It's because it's weak.

1928
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:26,170
It's hard to find them.

1929
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:28,430
Oh.

1930
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:29,070
Oh, this way.

1931
01:40:30,970 --> 01:40:32,930
Also, I'm not familiar with this map.

1932
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:33,990
Where is the box?

1933
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:46,180
This is... what?

1934
01:40:54,270 --> 01:40:55,410
Leave me alone.

1935
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:58,210
Oh my gosh.

1936
01:40:58,370 --> 01:40:59,130
Oh my gosh.

1937
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:01,690
Am

1938
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:18,140
I able to bomb?

1939
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:21,140
This

1940
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:29,160
way.

1941
01:41:36,270 --> 01:41:36,990
Really?

1942
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:43,420
I don't want to fight the boss with the mine, though.

1943
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:46,700
No confidence.

1944
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,360
Ugh!

1945
01:41:53,770 --> 01:41:54,750
What if we get to the bo...

1946
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:58,330
What if we get to the boss on hard?

1947
01:41:58,650 --> 01:42:01,860
What if we get to the boss on hard?

1948
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:02,780
Oh, wait.

1949
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:03,160
We did.

1950
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:06,780
We did.

1951
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:08,840
Okay, we can do it again.

1952
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:10,400
We can do it again.

1953
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:21,700
I believe.

1954
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:26,820
I don't believe.

1955
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:27,220
I don't believe.

1956
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,540
My gosh, girls.

1957
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:33,960
You came running up on me.

1958
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,100
You came running up on me.

1959
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,760
I was like, why are there so many people already?

1960
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:42,060
It's

1961
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:47,200
a lack of confidence thing, everybody.

1962
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:50,500
It's a confidence thing, everybody.

1963
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:51,640
I forgot we were on hard mode.

1964
01:42:58,440 --> 01:42:59,060
Oh, wow.

1965
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:00,520
They shoot so many more, too.

1966
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:01,820
I just realized.

1967
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:04,060
I think everyone's faster.

1968
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:06,180
And also...

1969
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:09,320
They shoot more.

1970
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:14,480
Yeah, this guy shoots way more.

1971
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,920
Oh, wait.

1972
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:16,480
What did I hit?

1973
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:18,120
I actually didn't notice at all.

1974
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:20,360
Thank you for the five.

1975
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:20,780
Thank you.

1976
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:22,520
What did I hit?

1977
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:30,540
Revolver.

1978
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:33,680
It was a fast bullet.

1979
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:34,700
It was a bullet.

1980
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:35,240
Okay.

1981
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:37,700
Wow.

1982
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:38,580
I'm regressing?

1983
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:40,440
Let's go, amigo.

1984
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:41,240
For real.

1985
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:42,520
Once

1986
01:43:56,850 --> 01:44:00,430
again, the revolver seems to be a winner.

1987
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:07,570
The revolver seems to be a real winner in this game.

1988
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:19,380
I think it's actually super good.

1989
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:35,760
Okay.

1990
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,620
I know this is going to sound like Cope.

1991
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:41,000
But I pressed D and I didn't...

1992
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:41,320
Wait.

1993
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:43,460
I know this is going to sound like Cope.

1994
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:45,420
But it was actually my keyboard.

1995
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:47,260
I know this is going to sound like Cope.

1996
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,520
No, it sounds like Cope, for real!

1997
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:51,220
But it was actually my keyboard!

1998
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:55,280
Sure...

1999
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:56,600
No, it was!

2000
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,180
It was!

2001
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,940
It sounds like Cope!

2002
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,960
But I... you know...

2003
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,680
You guys know that I'm the first to admit when I'm actually bad at something.

2004
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:12,040
You guys know I wouldn't cope like that!

2005
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:14,280
You guys know!

2006
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:52,270
This way...

2007
01:45:53,310 --> 01:45:54,130
Machine gun!

2008
01:45:54,370 --> 01:45:55,130
No machine gun.

2009
01:45:55,590 --> 01:45:56,230
Oh, good.

2010
01:45:57,290 --> 01:45:57,790
Indeed!

2011
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:05,270
It's Josie again.

2012
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:06,790
Those guys are really fast.

2013
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:08,250
These ones, these ones.

2014
01:46:08,650 --> 01:46:09,930
I have to watch out for those.

2015
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:16,160
Where is he?

2016
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:21,220
Oh my god!

2017
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:22,040
Oh my god!

2018
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:24,440
Thank you, Arzy!

2019
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:32,400
Oh...

2020
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:34,940
Sounds...

2021
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:36,760
Like rhymes with hope.

2022
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:39,260
I've only known you for a week or two, Mint.

2023
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:40,240
So, Cope...

2024
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:41,740
You know what?

2025
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:42,600
That's so fair.

2026
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:43,760
That's so fair.

2027
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:46,140
Wow!

2028
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:51,660
Me now, because it's the boss, you guys.

2029
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:52,920
Eleven is the boss!

2030
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:54,000
Eleven is the boss!

2031
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:55,080
Alright.

2032
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:56,220
Let's go, amigo.

2033
01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:56,920
Let's go!

2034
01:46:57,380 --> 01:46:59,160
One more try.

2035
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:03,500
One more try.

2036
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:09,620
Last... LG, LG everybody.

2037
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:10,340
LG, LG.

2038
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:11,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

2039
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:15,340
LG, LG.

2040
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:18,820
Oh, no.

2041
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:19,540
Hold on.

2042
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,100
LG one more time.

2043
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:33,520
It's because... like I know I ran into it.

2044
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:38,240
I forget that the chainsaw also pushes you.

2045
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:41,140
Just like how the machine gun does.

2046
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:46,660
LG, round three!

2047
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:51,920
When I say LG, I mean...

2048
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:54,820
One more try getting to the boss.

2049
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:56,720
Oh my god, already?

2050
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:00,760
Why

2051
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:05,440
am I not shooting?

2052
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:06,780
What's wrong with me?

2053
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,520
Maybe I'm already checked out.

2054
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,100
Maybe I'm like, you know what?

2055
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:11,160
I'm done with this game.

2056
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:16,500
I don't want to play with you anymore.

2057
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:23,000
My roach trauma.

2058
01:48:27,820 --> 01:48:28,580
Wait, actually?

2059
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:29,220
Oh, no.

2060
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:29,600
Wait.

2061
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:30,160
Oh, is this way?

2062
01:48:57,030 --> 01:48:57,910
Okay, that's new.

2063
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:01,810
Okay, that's...

2064
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:02,970
Um...

2065
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:04,850
I didn't know.

2066
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:08,470
Did it ever do that?

2067
01:49:08,570 --> 01:49:09,530
No, it didn't.

2068
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:11,730
That's hard mode, baby.

2069
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:16,230
TV table turn.

2070
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:18,050
I'm sorry.

2071
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:20,070
I feel like I've just been screaming this whole time.

2072
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:20,510
You know what?

2073
01:49:20,550 --> 01:49:21,530
Maybe we'll call it here.

2074
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,180
Give my... give my throat a rest.

2075
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:29,500
No!

2076
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:30,980
No, I don't feel satisfied.

2077
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,600
I won't feel satisfied.

2078
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,740
Try to walk!

2079
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:34,520
Never mind.

2080
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:36,360
LG.

2081
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:36,920
LG.

2082
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:37,920
LG.

2083
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,080
LG again.

2084
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:43,660
I wish I could just have the revolver the whole time.

2085
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:46,260
Machine

2086
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:50,300
gun.

2087
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:51,380
Machine gun.

2088
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:53,240
Shooting

2089
01:49:57,970 --> 01:49:58,530
backwards!

2090
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:18,500
Oh, this way.

2091
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:25,920
Oh, my God.

2092
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:26,520
They're all here.

2093
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:27,760
Go away!

2094
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:31,240
Go away!

2095
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:31,960
Go away!

2096
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:32,420
Go away!

2097
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:33,700
Okay.

2098
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:35,360
Bonk!

2099
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:35,760
Bonk!

2100
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:36,120
Bonk!

2101
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:36,660
Bonk!

2102
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:37,660
Bonk!

2103
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:38,020
Bonk!

2104
01:50:38,020 --> 01:50:38,020
Bonk!

2105
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:30,640
If I lose to this little listener's hand, I might actually become the Joker!

2106
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:32,780
I

2107
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:44,280
was moving up and I was too slow.

2108
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:45,540
I don't know.

2109
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:58,920
It's hard.

2110
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:04,420
No, no, no.

2111
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:07,020
It was if I died to the little guy, but I was fine.

2112
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:10,260
Instead, I... I was moving up, but the...

2113
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:10,940
I don't know.

2114
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:12,380
I don't... I don't know...

2115
01:52:12,380 --> 01:52:13,240
What?

2116
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:16,060
I mean, I guess, obviously, you hit my hitbox, but...

2117
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:16,340
Hmm.

2118
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,820
This stream could have its own Scream compilation.

2119
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:21,700
I'm the Joker.

2120
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:25,220
Then keep going.

2121
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,640
All it takes is one bad day.

2122
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:32,200
Did you guys see the trailer for the next Joker movie?

2123
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:34,500
The one with, uh...

2124
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:38,000
Hold on, I'm fixing my context again.

2125
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:39,540
Oh, my eye hurts so bad.

2126
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:40,780
Um...

2127
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:43,460
With, uh...

2128
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:44,820
Yeah, with Harley Quinn!

2129
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:46,120
Lady Gaga, Harley Quinn!

2130
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:48,980
I usually avoid trailers.

2131
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:50,220
That's... that makes... that's...

2132
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:51,660
No, I... I get that.

2133
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:52,100
I get that.

2134
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:52,400
Yeah.

2135
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:55,620
Oh, it's out!

2136
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:56,880
Oh, wait!

2137
01:52:57,340 --> 01:52:58,700
Wait, is it actually out?

2138
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:02,360
The Frisbee Killing You is a reference to the original...

2139
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:04,180
game Super Crate Box...

2140
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:07,060
that this game plays homage to from 2010.

2141
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:09,480
Where the disc gun could bounce back and kill you.

2142
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:09,800
Ah!

2143
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:12,280
That makes sense.

2144
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:12,860
That makes sense.

2145
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:15,040
Joker 2 with Joaquin and...

2146
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:16,320
Lady Gaga.

2147
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:17,280
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

2148
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:21,060
We live in a musical.

2149
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:24,400
Yeah, Lady Gaga is...

2150
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:26,300
playing Harley Quinn.

2151
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,300
It actually looks so good.

2152
01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:32,320
Oh, it isn't out until October.

2153
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:33,720
Who said that they saw it?

2154
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:37,860
Everyone knows it's only LG if it's a good round.

2155
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:39,800
Andragos, thanks for the time!

2156
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:40,880
Gifted!

2157
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:41,780
Thank you so much!

2158
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:42,200
Thank you!

2159
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:46,140
Don't care for the casting.

2160
01:53:46,780 --> 01:53:47,200
It's...

2161
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:49,400
I think it's...

2162
01:53:51,540 --> 01:53:52,100
Hold on.

2163
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:53,160
I think it's...

2164
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:54,900
different, yes.

2165
01:53:57,260 --> 01:53:57,900
I think it's...

2166
01:53:57,900 --> 01:54:00,520
Like I wouldn't expect Harley Quinn to be Lady Gaga.

2167
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:03,900
But I don't think I mind it so much either.

2168
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:06,360
Me when I spread misinformation.

2169
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:11,040
I'm spreading misinformation on the internet!

2170
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:14,460
That's me when I spread misinformation.

2171
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:19,780
I think I'll still see it though.

2172
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:21,280
I really like the first one.

2173
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:28,280
Lady Gaga was great in American Horror Story, so I'll reserve judgement.

2174
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:31,420
I think...

2175
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:33,100
I tend to like Lady Gaga a lot.

2176
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:34,360
Because...

2177
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:36,860
People tend to underestimate her.

2178
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:39,200
Like...

2179
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:43,340
Back in the day, before she was like...

2180
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:44,740
Not back in the day.

2181
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,320
Thank you so much!

2182
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:46,880
Thank you!

2183
01:54:48,700 --> 01:54:49,180
Like...

2184
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:51,880
When she was still like...

2185
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:54,220
Poker face kind of Lady Gaga.

2186
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:55,980
Like people, you know...

2187
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:58,620
Just thought she was some generic pop star like singer.

2188
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:00,860
And that her singing was, you know...

2189
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:01,500
Average.

2190
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:03,280
But...

2191
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:06,000
I can't believe Shrek came out 27 years ago.

2192
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:07,900
No it didn't.

2193
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:11,440
When did Shrek come out?

2194
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:12,720
Actually I have no idea.

2195
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:22,630
One shouldn't forget that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.

2196
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:24,190
Stop calling me out.

2197
01:55:24,630 --> 01:55:25,890
I saved the streamlabs.

2198
01:55:26,170 --> 01:55:27,710
Sorry that I haven't been reading them out.

2199
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:28,450
I see them though.

2200
01:55:28,970 --> 01:55:30,450
Have confidence, Minto-chan.

2201
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:31,530
Minto-chan kawaii.

2202
01:55:31,530 --> 01:55:32,090
Totally real.

2203
01:55:32,290 --> 01:55:32,770
Undoctored.

2204
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:33,250
Coronate.

2205
01:55:33,390 --> 01:55:33,870
Quote.

2206
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:40,380
But yeah.

2207
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:41,480
When she was...

2208
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:43,020
When Lady Gaga was still like...

2209
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:43,820
Poker face lady.

2210
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:46,980
People didn't know that she could sing.

2211
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:49,240
But she can sing so well, actually.

2212
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:51,440
Let's go, amigo.

2213
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:52,300
Let's go.

2214
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:53,040
She's...

2215
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:54,640
Shrek?

2216
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:54,920
No!

2217
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:56,100
She's good.

2218
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:57,500
Yobi!

2219
01:55:57,620 --> 01:55:57,740
Yobi!

2220
01:55:58,040 --> 01:55:58,440
Yobi!

2221
01:55:58,440 --> 01:55:58,540
Yobi!

2222
01:56:02,730 --> 01:56:03,210
Yobi!

2223
01:56:03,990 --> 01:56:04,550
Wait.

2224
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:06,750
Oh, I'm on hard mode again.

2225
01:56:06,830 --> 01:56:07,110
I forgot.

2226
01:56:07,970 --> 01:56:09,090
No, Frisbee!

2227
01:56:10,230 --> 01:56:11,270
No, Frisbee!

2228
01:56:12,130 --> 01:56:12,530
Yobi!

2229
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:23,750
Scared of Frisbee.

2230
01:56:24,490 --> 01:56:25,990
Don't do that,

2231
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:39,270
mister.

2232
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:41,990
Don't do that, mister.

2233
01:56:46,270 --> 01:56:47,510
Oh, this side.

2234
01:56:48,190 --> 01:56:48,750
Roach!

2235
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:49,050
Roach!

2236
01:56:49,050 --> 01:56:49,550
Roach!

2237
01:56:49,550 --> 01:56:49,690
Roach!

2238
01:56:49,690 --> 01:56:49,970
Roach!

2239
01:56:50,090 --> 01:56:50,150
Roach!

2240
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:50,530
Roach!

2241
01:56:50,730 --> 01:56:51,290
Roach!

2242
01:56:51,290 --> 01:56:51,450
Roach!

2243
01:56:51,690 --> 01:56:52,250
Roach!

2244
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:52,370
Roach!

2245
01:56:53,770 --> 01:56:54,330
Roach!

2246
01:56:54,330 --> 01:56:54,750
Roach!

2247
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:58,750
This game has proven to me that my throat is never going to recover.

2248
01:56:58,930 --> 01:57:01,290
I'm always going to be raspy for the rest of my life.

2249
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:06,490
I think I'm always going to sound raspy for the rest of my life.

2250
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:40,580
Every time she says that, it makes me think, kurae yo, which is, you know, like, it reminds me of Free Rin being in the Mimic Mouth.

2251
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:43,460
Oh, I haven't gotten this in a while.

2252
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:44,820
Oh my gosh.

2253
01:57:48,980 --> 01:57:50,160
Overkill, but that's okay.

2254
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:52,660
Yobi, Yobi!

2255
01:58:01,170 --> 01:58:01,930
Kurae yo!

2256
01:58:02,190 --> 01:58:03,030
Kuae yo!

2257
01:58:03,770 --> 01:58:04,970
That's me in this game.

2258
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:06,630
Kuae yo!

2259
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:07,530
Kuae yo!

2260
01:58:07,590 --> 01:58:08,230
Kuae yo!

2261
01:58:08,230 --> 01:58:08,810
Kuae yo!

2262
01:58:08,850 --> 01:58:09,310
Kuae yo!

2263
01:58:09,330 --> 01:58:09,850
Kuae yo!

2264
01:58:12,610 --> 01:58:13,570
I'm scared.

2265
01:58:14,230 --> 01:58:15,430
Does it sound like...

2266
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:15,990
Punk!

2267
01:58:16,070 --> 01:58:16,530
Punk!

2268
01:58:16,850 --> 01:58:17,330
Punk!

2269
01:58:17,530 --> 01:58:17,710
Punk!

2270
01:58:17,710 --> 01:58:18,430
Shut the gah!

2271
01:58:18,570 --> 01:58:19,130
Shut the gah!

2272
01:58:19,170 --> 01:58:19,710
Okay, here we go.

2273
01:58:19,870 --> 01:58:21,590
What weapon are we going to get for the boss?

2274
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:23,070
Oh my god.

2275
01:58:23,110 --> 01:58:23,650
Don't jinx it.

2276
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:24,390
Don't jinx it!

2277
01:58:25,810 --> 01:58:27,090
Oh, I'm dying.

2278
01:58:27,230 --> 01:58:27,890
Thank you, boy.

2279
01:58:46,330 --> 01:58:47,570
And that was...

2280
01:58:47,570 --> 01:58:47,650
Let's go, Amigo!

2281
01:58:47,650 --> 01:58:48,050
Let's go!

2282
01:58:48,510 --> 01:58:51,670
That was your classic jinx, everybody.

2283
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:58,150
That was like the most classic jinx ever.

2284
01:58:59,970 --> 01:59:00,770
I'm dying.

2285
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:08,280
All right, let's go.

2286
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:08,920
Okay.

2287
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:09,800
Thank you!

2288
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:10,300
Thank you, Chiron-chan!

2289
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:11,500
Thank you!

2290
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:13,160
Oops.

2291
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:29,550
It was down here anyway.

2292
01:59:29,850 --> 01:59:33,570
Oh my god, please.

2293
01:59:35,390 --> 01:59:36,430
I'm getting...

2294
01:59:36,430 --> 01:59:36,910
I'm getting...

2295
01:59:36,910 --> 01:59:37,870
I'm getting...

2296
01:59:42,670 --> 01:59:46,510
I was getting cornered.

2297
01:59:46,670 --> 01:59:47,890
I'm getting cornered.

2298
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:47,950
I'm getting cornered.

2299
01:59:47,950 --> 01:59:48,010
I'm getting cornered.

2300
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:09,720
Her duets with Bennett really showed her talent.

2301
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:11,260
Who's Bennett?

2302
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:26,300
What's this way?

2303
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:28,140
Run!

2304
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:29,160
Run!

2305
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:41,380
This way.

2306
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:45,880
Please.

2307
02:00:57,370 --> 02:00:58,530
I'm regressing.

2308
02:00:58,990 --> 02:01:00,530
Who's Tony Bennett?

2309
02:01:01,570 --> 02:01:02,230
The singer.

2310
02:01:02,590 --> 02:01:03,770
What has he...

2311
02:01:03,770 --> 02:01:05,830
What has he...

2312
02:01:06,670 --> 02:01:07,070
Um...

2313
02:01:07,710 --> 02:01:08,590
What has he done?

2314
02:01:08,690 --> 02:01:10,110
Okay, this is actual LG.

2315
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:12,910
LG!

2316
02:01:14,610 --> 02:01:15,010
Nice.

2317
02:01:20,610 --> 02:01:21,430
LG, everybody.

2318
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:26,240
Oh my god.

2319
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,640
Unless I get eaten by the roaches.

2320
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:30,080
I don't know.

2321
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:31,540
Where have you been, Shuba?

2322
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:32,860
Where have you been, Shuba?

2323
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:34,360
You were gone.

2324
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:35,660
And then you came back.

2325
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:36,780
And now...

2326
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:43,530
Bunk!

2327
02:01:43,750 --> 02:01:44,650
Bunk, bunk, bunk!

2328
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:54,360
No Frisbee!

2329
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:57,080
No Frisbee.

2330
02:01:58,020 --> 02:01:59,160
No Frisbee.

2331
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:01,260
No Frisbee.

2332
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:03,720
Go away, Frisbee.

2333
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:06,260
Go away, Frisbee.

2334
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:17,000
Guys, I think I'm dead.

2335
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:18,840
I think I'm dead.

2336
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:21,960
Or not!

2337
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:24,380
Oh my god.

2338
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:25,680
How I lived that?

2339
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:26,720
I don't know.

2340
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:28,060
I don't know.

2341
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:29,680
I don't know how I lived that.

2342
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:31,340
I don't know how I lived that.

2343
02:02:31,860 --> 02:02:32,980
I don't know how I lived that.

2344
02:02:33,020 --> 02:02:33,380
God gamer.

2345
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:36,820
God gamer.

2346
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:43,460
Don't clip any of my failures of just running into, you know, normal guy.

2347
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:45,280
Clip that one.

2348
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:47,300
Clip me being a god gamer, okay?

2349
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:47,680
Oh!

2350
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:48,480
Oh!

2351
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:49,200
Oh!

2352
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:50,680
Oh!

2353
02:02:50,860 --> 02:02:51,220
Oh!

2354
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:51,940
Oh!

2355
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:52,160
You know what?

2356
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:52,920
That's okay.

2357
02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:00,370
Don't clip that part.

2358
02:03:00,570 --> 02:03:02,070
Because I'm running into a small guy.

2359
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:12,500
I didn't think it was possible for ghosts to be possessed, but...

2360
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:15,160
I think I was possessed by ninja.

2361
02:03:30,150 --> 02:03:30,550
Terrible.

2362
02:03:32,290 --> 02:03:33,170
Oh, don't clip!

2363
02:03:33,290 --> 02:03:33,950
This is not here!

2364
02:03:34,330 --> 02:03:35,150
No, no, no, no!

2365
02:03:38,570 --> 02:03:40,110
Don't, don't, don't do it.

2366
02:03:43,590 --> 02:03:44,830
Don't clip this.

2367
02:03:47,050 --> 02:03:47,810
Wait, wait, wait.

2368
02:03:47,970 --> 02:03:48,310
Hold on.

2369
02:03:48,590 --> 02:03:49,310
Actually, hold on.

2370
02:03:53,450 --> 02:03:54,010
Hold on.

2371
02:04:02,750 --> 02:04:03,290
Let's see.

2372
02:04:06,730 --> 02:04:07,430
Okay, hold on.

2373
02:04:07,510 --> 02:04:09,330
Now we just need it in...

2374
02:04:11,310 --> 02:04:14,510
Put it in black, and I gotta find a font that's kinda similar.

2375
02:04:14,810 --> 02:04:15,290
Okay, hold on.

2376
02:04:15,870 --> 02:04:16,470
Let's see.

2377
02:04:18,490 --> 02:04:19,610
I know I have some.

2378
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:28,920
Quick, someone contact the devs and ask them what font they use.

2379
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:32,220
I'll download it.

2380
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:39,960
Do I not have an 8-bit-y kind of font?

2381
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:41,720
Oh,

2382
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:52,840
I thought I had some.

2383
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:54,560
I know I used to have some.

2384
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:57,280
Maybe I have to re-download them.

2385
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:12,560
The one looks sus.

2386
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:14,720
Are you sure?

2387
02:05:15,340 --> 02:05:16,580
Are you sure?

2388
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:18,780
Are you sure?

2389
02:05:23,930 --> 02:05:24,710
Are you sure?

2390
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:34,250
I'm hacking.

2391
02:05:35,170 --> 02:05:38,130
I'm hacking... the game right now.

2392
02:05:38,950 --> 02:05:40,630
Quack, quack, quack, quack...

2393
02:05:41,370 --> 02:05:42,310
What's that one?

2394
02:05:42,410 --> 02:05:44,090
I don't remember ever downloading that.

2395
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:50,000
What is this one?

2396
02:05:51,340 --> 02:05:52,380
Oh no, it's gone!

2397
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:52,560
Oh my god!

2398
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,180
I think I messed up.

2399
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:02,120
Oh wait.

2400
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:05,800
It's so thin.

2401
02:06:07,740 --> 02:06:09,180
She's such a skilled gamer.

2402
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:14,600
You guys, I'm gonna have to ask you to avert your eyes.

2403
02:06:17,780 --> 02:06:21,700
I'm not trying to give away my gaming secrets here right now, okay?

2404
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:22,960
I'm just saying.

2405
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:28,600
Okay?

2406
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:35,560
What do you mean by that, Ghostorb?

2407
02:06:36,580 --> 02:06:37,700
What do you mean by that?

2408
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:41,660
What do you mean by that?

2409
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:46,540
God gamer.

2410
02:06:57,910 --> 02:06:59,790
Literally just screencap and crop?

2411
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:01,330
You're so right!

2412
02:07:03,390 --> 02:07:04,410
Oh my gosh!

2413
02:07:04,530 --> 02:07:05,570
You're so right!

2414
02:07:05,630 --> 02:07:06,530
You're so right!

2415
02:07:08,790 --> 02:07:09,410
You're so right!

2416
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:12,210
Why

2417
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:22,980
did I think of that?

2418
02:07:41,330 --> 02:07:42,290
Drumroll please!

2419
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:14,240
No!

2420
02:08:14,300 --> 02:08:14,760
No!

2421
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:16,220
I promise you, Dev.

2422
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:17,100
I got 19!

2423
02:08:17,620 --> 02:08:18,820
I got 19.

2424
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:21,660
That's my... I promise.

2425
02:08:22,140 --> 02:08:23,120
Right chat?

2426
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:24,600
You can vouch for me.

2427
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:26,060
You saw that.

2428
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:27,100
Right chat?

2429
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:29,340
I'm grabbing you by the neck.

2430
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:30,840
I'm grabbing you by your collar right now.

2431
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:35,600
If you don't say that I didn't get 19, you better say that I got 19 right now.

2432
02:08:36,540 --> 02:08:37,340
You better say that I got 19 right now.

2433
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:40,800
Is that the IQ?

2434
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:41,460
Is that the IQ?

2435
02:08:42,980 --> 02:08:44,580
You better say it.

2436
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:47,560
You got 19 and it was a really good run.

2437
02:08:47,620 --> 02:08:48,380
You better say that.

2438
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:50,880
It's true.

2439
02:08:50,940 --> 02:08:51,540
I saw 19.

2440
02:08:52,220 --> 02:08:53,020
Forever 19.

2441
02:08:58,360 --> 02:08:59,820
You got 19.

2442
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:00,380
You got 19.

2443
02:09:00,380 --> 02:09:00,400
You got 19.

2444
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:00,740
Thank you.

2445
02:09:01,460 --> 02:09:03,360
She's an 11 but she's a ghost.

2446
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:05,100
She's an 11 but she's a ghost.

2447
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:06,920
She's an 11 but she's a ghost.

2448
02:09:14,070 --> 02:09:14,450
Harder.

2449
02:09:15,110 --> 02:09:15,490
Yeah.

2450
02:09:15,630 --> 02:09:16,230
You know what?

2451
02:09:16,230 --> 02:09:17,530
I don't think we need a harder level.

2452
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:18,550
I think you're right.

2453
02:09:19,830 --> 02:09:21,690
I think I need to be knocked down a peg.

2454
02:09:22,050 --> 02:09:23,770
I think I need to only get 5.

2455
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:24,470
I think I need to only get 5.

2456
02:09:27,950 --> 02:09:29,250
I think I need to only get 5.

2457
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:29,850
You're too high for me.

2458
02:09:33,890 --> 02:09:36,430
Can you grab me by the neck again?

2459
02:09:36,630 --> 02:09:37,690
No, I grabbed your collar.

2460
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:39,070
Like a bully, you know?

2461
02:09:40,090 --> 02:09:40,830
It's true.

2462
02:09:41,030 --> 02:09:41,950
I was the 19.

2463
02:09:43,330 --> 02:09:44,130
You know what?

2464
02:09:44,490 --> 02:09:46,330
It's not about quantity.

2465
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:48,110
It's about quality.

2466
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:48,990
Right?

2467
02:09:49,670 --> 02:09:51,110
You don't want to have...

2468
02:09:51,110 --> 02:09:53,490
You don't want to have 19...

2469
02:09:53,490 --> 02:09:54,950
whatever friends.

2470
02:09:55,310 --> 02:09:57,290
You want to have 11 best friends.

2471
02:09:58,710 --> 02:09:59,230
You want to have 11 best friends.

2472
02:09:59,250 --> 02:10:03,270
You don't want to have 19 friends that you can't rely on.

2473
02:10:03,430 --> 02:10:03,550
You don't want to have 19 friends that you can't rely on.

2474
02:10:03,770 --> 02:10:05,610
11 is the perfect number.

2475
02:10:06,030 --> 02:10:07,750
Of friends to have.

2476
02:10:13,190 --> 02:10:15,050
The 11 best people.

2477
02:10:15,190 --> 02:10:15,750
Exactly.

2478
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:22,150
Aim for 11.

2479
02:10:22,690 --> 02:10:23,010
Aim for 11.

2480
02:10:23,590 --> 02:10:26,410
Dare I say the consistency to get this score.

2481
02:10:26,570 --> 02:10:27,910
I give it an 11 out of 10.

2482
02:10:29,350 --> 02:10:30,250
Thank you.

2483
02:10:30,350 --> 02:10:31,370
Thank you very much.

2484
02:10:31,490 --> 02:10:31,950
Thank you.

2485
02:10:34,050 --> 02:10:34,830
Useless fact.

2486
02:10:35,010 --> 02:10:38,690
In the Age of Empires 2 community, 11 is the way people laugh.

2487
02:10:38,930 --> 02:10:40,390
Just like W1JP chats.

2488
02:10:41,050 --> 02:10:43,950
I've been giggling this whole time.

2489
02:10:48,030 --> 02:10:48,550
Okay.

2490
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:56,830
Maybe one day I will come back and have a...

2491
02:10:58,650 --> 02:10:59,470
Revengeance with this.

2492
02:11:00,250 --> 02:11:01,610
I'll practice off stream.

2493
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:02,850
It is so much fun though.

2494
02:11:02,910 --> 02:11:03,450
I had a lot of fun.

2495
02:11:03,870 --> 02:11:05,370
11, 11, 11, 11, 11.

2496
02:11:06,990 --> 02:11:08,150
What does it mean?

2497
02:11:08,310 --> 02:11:08,870
Like why though?

2498
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:11,610
Is it because if you say 11 it's an emo?

2499
02:11:11,950 --> 02:11:12,390
Or...

2500
02:11:15,490 --> 02:11:16,750
Like a laughing emo?

2501
02:11:22,970 --> 02:11:23,410
Revengeance?

2502
02:11:23,410 --> 02:11:23,890
Metal Gear?

2503
02:11:24,050 --> 02:11:24,630
I'll be honest.

2504
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:28,950
I forget that revengeance is not a real word sometimes.

2505
02:11:30,190 --> 02:11:30,630
I've...

2506
02:11:31,390 --> 02:11:31,990
I've been like...

2507
02:11:31,990 --> 02:11:37,370
I've been saying revengeance unironically.

2508
02:11:37,510 --> 02:11:40,510
Like I used to say it ironically and now I say it unironically.

2509
02:11:41,830 --> 02:11:43,710
But yeah, Tian, this is such a fun game!

2510
02:11:45,910 --> 02:11:47,070
I had so much fun.

2511
02:11:47,590 --> 02:11:49,650
And I'm gonna beat my high score.

2512
02:11:49,910 --> 02:11:51,810
I'm gonna get to 25.

2513
02:11:54,030 --> 02:11:54,970
That's the goal.

2514
02:11:55,390 --> 02:11:57,190
And I'm gonna screenshot it.

2515
02:11:57,330 --> 02:11:58,390
And it won't be...

2516
02:11:58,390 --> 02:12:02,330
It won't be edited because you guys know I don't have the font.

2517
02:12:07,130 --> 02:12:09,350
I don't have the font for...

2518
02:12:11,410 --> 02:12:12,370
25, damn.

2519
02:12:12,470 --> 02:12:13,050
I'm aiming high.

2520
02:12:18,170 --> 02:12:19,430
Photoshop doesn't exist, guys.

2521
02:12:19,510 --> 02:12:21,530
You guys, I don't have the font for 25.

2522
02:12:23,070 --> 02:12:24,590
It's the laughter taunt in chat.

2523
02:12:24,730 --> 02:12:24,970
Yes.

2524
02:12:24,990 --> 02:12:25,670
That's so funny.

2525
02:12:27,850 --> 02:12:29,010
1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

2526
02:12:31,390 --> 02:12:33,530
What fantasy mint outfit would you get?

2527
02:12:33,670 --> 02:12:34,510
Mage, etc.

2528
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:43,280
This is so much fun!

2529
02:12:43,460 --> 02:12:45,100
Thank you for making a fun game.

2530
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:47,060
And it's so cute.

2531
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:50,800
I love hearing Korone say I'm a dog!

2532
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:56,140
If I can...

2533
02:12:57,990 --> 02:12:59,870
Fantasy outfit...

2534
02:13:02,310 --> 02:13:04,510
I think merchant is kinda cute.

2535
02:13:04,950 --> 02:13:05,510
Right?

2536
02:13:07,390 --> 02:13:08,270
Like a wanderer...

2537
02:13:08,270 --> 02:13:10,070
Wandering trade merchant.

2538
02:13:11,930 --> 02:13:12,530
Also...

2539
02:13:12,530 --> 02:13:14,930
A mage would be really cute.

2540
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:15,810
Or like a witch.

2541
02:13:17,010 --> 02:13:18,650
With a big old witch's hat.

2542
02:13:22,780 --> 02:13:23,380
Think...

2543
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:25,660
Think merchant, like Reseteer, right?

2544
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:32,180
Good morning!

2545
02:13:33,580 --> 02:13:36,950
What do you buy?

2546
02:13:37,330 --> 02:13:38,370
What do you sell?

2547
02:13:39,210 --> 02:13:41,670
Alright, I'm gonna move over to...

2548
02:13:41,670 --> 02:13:43,550
I don't know if you guys noticed...

2549
02:13:43,550 --> 02:13:43,830
But...

2550
02:13:46,190 --> 02:13:46,990
I have...

2551
02:13:47,730 --> 02:13:48,970
Korone's bones in my hair.

2552
02:13:52,130 --> 02:13:52,990
Give me a second...

2553
02:13:52,990 --> 02:13:54,050
I'm gonna set up some BGM.

2554
02:13:54,870 --> 02:13:56,510
That was good BGM...

2555
02:13:56,510 --> 02:13:57,950
But maybe something a little more chill...

2556
02:13:57,950 --> 02:13:59,930
To let my brain sleep out of my ears.

2557
02:14:03,210 --> 02:14:03,790
Actually, no.

2558
02:14:03,870 --> 02:14:04,430
I want this one.

2559
02:14:09,430 --> 02:14:09,910
Yeah!

2560
02:14:11,990 --> 02:14:12,950
You see him?

2561
02:14:12,990 --> 02:14:13,490
You see him?

2562
02:14:14,150 --> 02:14:15,910
I'll move this away for a second.

2563
02:14:23,550 --> 02:14:25,570
But it kind of is hard to see...

2564
02:14:25,570 --> 02:14:26,670
Because of my own hair clip.

2565
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:32,410
I stole Korone's bones.

2566
02:14:33,610 --> 02:14:34,930
Her bones are not mine.

2567
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:37,650
Yubi yubi.

2568
02:14:37,950 --> 02:14:38,750
As they say.

2569
02:14:41,190 --> 02:14:43,570
Korone was the very first YouTuber I watched regularly.

2570
02:14:43,750 --> 02:14:43,830
Korone was the very first YouTuber I watched regularly.

2571
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:45,170
So it was really cool to see you play this.

2572
02:14:46,470 --> 02:14:48,650
There's so many cute little references and everything.

2573
02:14:49,070 --> 02:14:49,730
So fun.

2574
02:14:51,150 --> 02:14:52,830
Did she take your yubis in return?

2575
02:14:54,690 --> 02:14:55,830
I have no yubis.

2576
02:14:56,470 --> 02:14:56,910
Look.

2577
02:14:58,030 --> 02:14:59,170
Can't see my yubis.

2578
02:15:02,290 --> 02:15:03,810
Just floppy.

2579
02:15:04,010 --> 02:15:06,090
Under here, they're just nubs.

2580
02:15:09,350 --> 02:15:10,670
Just little...

2581
02:15:10,670 --> 02:15:11,410
It's like...

2582
02:15:11,410 --> 02:15:13,790
Actually, it's like a lego...

2583
02:15:13,790 --> 02:15:14,850
Lego hand.

2584
02:15:15,950 --> 02:15:17,370
It's a lego hand.

2585
02:15:17,490 --> 02:15:18,370
So it's just like...

2586
02:15:18,370 --> 02:15:21,090
One big circle.

2587
02:15:23,190 --> 02:15:24,430
Send yubis.

2588
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:27,590
Send yubis.

2589
02:15:27,590 --> 02:15:28,690
Send yubis.

2590
02:15:28,690 --> 02:15:29,150
Send yubis.

2591
02:15:30,710 --> 02:15:31,450
Well guys.

2592
02:15:31,610 --> 02:15:32,810
I'm going to...

2593
02:15:33,930 --> 02:15:34,890
Read donations.

2594
02:15:34,950 --> 02:15:35,670
Real quick.

2595
02:15:37,150 --> 02:15:38,110
Like I said.

2596
02:15:38,150 --> 02:15:39,170
It's a bit of a shorter stream.

2597
02:15:39,370 --> 02:15:41,950
Just wanted something to have a bit of fun with.

2598
02:15:42,350 --> 02:15:44,370
Like a little crazy amount of fun.

2599
02:15:45,690 --> 02:15:47,370
Crazy time with rather.

2600
02:15:48,190 --> 02:15:49,210
It was fun though.

2601
02:15:49,290 --> 02:15:49,830
It was a lot of fun.

2602
02:15:50,250 --> 02:15:50,730
Revengeance.

2603
02:15:50,750 --> 02:15:53,310
Middle English period 11...

2604
02:15:55,770 --> 02:15:56,250
11...

2605
02:15:56,250 --> 02:15:57,070
Wait.

2606
02:15:59,530 --> 02:16:00,490
Borrowed from French.

2607
02:16:00,670 --> 02:16:01,850
A furious act of revenge.

2608
02:16:02,110 --> 02:16:03,730
To use violence to attain peace.

2609
02:16:04,390 --> 02:16:04,910
Oh.

2610
02:16:05,470 --> 02:16:06,430
Well there you go.

2611
02:16:06,970 --> 02:16:08,550
Revengeance is a real word.

2612
02:16:10,390 --> 02:16:10,910
Revengeance.

2613
02:16:11,290 --> 02:16:12,470
Korone is my oshi.

2614
02:16:12,630 --> 02:16:13,710
Thanks for playing this min.

2615
02:16:13,790 --> 02:16:14,210
Thank you.

2616
02:16:16,550 --> 02:16:18,210
Korone is so cute.

2617
02:16:20,070 --> 02:16:21,650
She is so so cute.

2618
02:16:22,070 --> 02:16:22,730
Oh my gosh.

2619
02:16:22,730 --> 02:16:23,870
Did you guys see the new...

2620
02:16:24,610 --> 02:16:25,850
The new...

2621
02:16:26,670 --> 02:16:27,290
Kanatan...

2622
02:16:28,460 --> 02:16:29,290
Pop-up parade.

2623
02:16:29,910 --> 02:16:31,270
That was announced.

2624
02:16:31,590 --> 02:16:33,690
Or not announced but went up for pre-order recently.

2625
02:16:34,030 --> 02:16:34,730
Oh my gosh.

2626
02:16:35,070 --> 02:16:37,830
I keep looking at it on AmiAmi because...

2627
02:16:37,830 --> 02:16:39,590
It looks so...

2628
02:16:39,590 --> 02:16:40,810
Well made.

2629
02:16:41,150 --> 02:16:43,170
It's so...

2630
02:16:44,370 --> 02:16:45,530
It's so cute.

2631
02:16:49,250 --> 02:16:49,930
I'll be honest.

2632
02:16:50,050 --> 02:16:51,130
I don't watch her so much.

2633
02:16:51,670 --> 02:16:53,870
But I think her design is like...

2634
02:16:53,870 --> 02:16:55,390
One of my favorites ever.

2635
02:16:55,710 --> 02:16:57,690
It's just the cutest...

2636
02:16:57,690 --> 02:16:58,490
Ever.

2637
02:16:58,610 --> 02:16:59,390
It's so...

2638
02:17:00,130 --> 02:17:01,610
Such a good design.

2639
02:17:01,850 --> 02:17:03,450
Everything about it is so perfect.

2640
02:17:06,410 --> 02:17:08,270
I like her mama so much.

2641
02:17:08,470 --> 02:17:10,010
Her mama's art is always so nice.

2642
02:17:10,450 --> 02:17:11,970
Her scale is crazy good too.

2643
02:17:12,010 --> 02:17:12,450
Oh I know.

2644
02:17:12,450 --> 02:17:13,650
It has so much like...

2645
02:17:13,650 --> 02:17:16,150
The base and everything.

2646
02:17:16,290 --> 02:17:17,070
It's so crazy.

2647
02:17:17,830 --> 02:17:18,310
Yeah.

2648
02:17:21,370 --> 02:17:22,610
She has some amazing outfits.

2649
02:17:22,690 --> 02:17:23,030
She does.

2650
02:17:23,190 --> 02:17:23,870
So cute.

2651
02:17:24,450 --> 02:17:25,390
So so cute.

2652
02:17:25,530 --> 02:17:26,970
I honestly...

2653
02:17:26,970 --> 02:17:30,790
I think I like the pop-up parade more than her...

2654
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:32,290
I'm looking at it right now.

2655
02:17:32,810 --> 02:17:34,770
I think I like it more than her...

2656
02:17:34,770 --> 02:17:35,810
Than the scale figure.

2657
02:17:39,230 --> 02:17:40,350
I think it's maybe...

2658
02:17:40,350 --> 02:17:41,570
Because in the scale figure...

2659
02:17:42,450 --> 02:17:42,650
She looks a little cooler.

2660
02:17:43,170 --> 02:17:44,510
But in the pop-up parade...

2661
02:17:44,510 --> 02:17:45,250
She looks cuter.

2662
02:17:47,290 --> 02:17:47,730
Maybe.

2663
02:17:48,090 --> 02:17:48,550
I don't know.

2664
02:17:49,070 --> 02:17:50,490
The pop-up is 10 out of 10.

2665
02:17:50,670 --> 02:17:52,750
Sometimes some pop-up parade figures...

2666
02:17:53,230 --> 02:17:53,670
Like...

2667
02:17:54,890 --> 02:17:55,730
I don't mean this...

2668
02:17:55,730 --> 02:17:56,470
Sometimes...

2669
02:17:57,110 --> 02:17:59,930
They can get the faces...

2670
02:17:59,930 --> 02:18:01,790
Well this happens with figures quite often.

2671
02:18:01,830 --> 02:18:02,450
To be honest.

2672
02:18:02,630 --> 02:18:04,630
Sometimes the faces can be a little off.

2673
02:18:04,790 --> 02:18:05,910
But this one is so perfect.

2674
02:18:06,350 --> 02:18:07,330
This one is so good.

2675
02:18:12,530 --> 02:18:14,630
Or just get a figure in general.

2676
02:18:15,190 --> 02:18:16,170
Be the coolest.

2677
02:18:20,170 --> 02:18:21,790
Sometimes the pose is too simple.

2678
02:18:22,350 --> 02:18:23,970
I typically like...

2679
02:18:25,370 --> 02:18:26,430
Figures with like...

2680
02:18:26,430 --> 02:18:27,770
Cool bases.

2681
02:18:27,910 --> 02:18:29,150
Or like...

2682
02:18:30,170 --> 02:18:31,930
Like there's the Shigure Ui one.

2683
02:18:32,110 --> 02:18:33,390
Where she's like sitting in the chair.

2684
02:18:33,690 --> 02:18:35,290
So it's not really a base but like...

2685
02:18:35,290 --> 02:18:38,110
It just adds a little bit of extra something.

2686
02:18:38,350 --> 02:18:39,710
Like I have this one figure...

2687
02:18:39,710 --> 02:18:41,710
Where it's just an original character.

2688
02:18:41,870 --> 02:18:43,590
But she's coming out of a tablet.

2689
02:18:44,250 --> 02:18:45,730
Let me see if I can find a picture of it.

2690
02:18:46,510 --> 02:18:46,910
Wait...

2691
02:18:46,910 --> 02:18:47,710
What was it called?

2692
02:18:52,190 --> 02:18:52,590
Uh...

2693
02:18:57,370 --> 02:18:57,770
Uh...

2694
02:18:58,650 --> 02:18:59,050
Uh...

2695
02:19:02,370 --> 02:19:02,770
Uh...

2696
02:19:02,770 --> 02:19:02,850
Uh...

2697
02:19:02,850 --> 02:19:03,610
Uh...

2698
02:19:04,130 --> 02:19:04,530
Oh!

2699
02:19:04,690 --> 02:19:05,470
I found it!

2700
02:19:05,490 --> 02:19:05,870
I found it!

2701
02:19:05,870 --> 02:19:06,330
I found it!

2702
02:19:06,410 --> 02:19:06,850
Oh my gosh.

2703
02:19:08,050 --> 02:19:08,950
Let's go Google.

2704
02:19:11,090 --> 02:19:12,050
By Nishizawa.

2705
02:19:14,030 --> 02:19:15,230
It's Nishizawa-san.

2706
02:19:15,410 --> 02:19:16,250
Is there...

2707
02:19:16,250 --> 02:19:17,330
It's like the artist...

2708
02:19:18,470 --> 02:19:19,190
What's the word?

2709
02:19:20,090 --> 02:19:20,570
Self...

2710
02:19:24,630 --> 02:19:26,230
Why can't I ever speak?

2711
02:19:26,870 --> 02:19:28,070
It's so cute though.

2712
02:19:28,170 --> 02:19:28,890
Hold on, I'll show you.

2713
02:19:29,470 --> 02:19:30,250
The figure.

2714
02:19:32,530 --> 02:19:33,310
Let me...

2715
02:19:33,310 --> 02:19:34,590
I'm gonna crop it a little bit.

2716
02:19:35,030 --> 02:19:36,510
Oh no, I don't need to crop it.

2717
02:19:36,570 --> 02:19:36,910
Just kidding.

2718
02:19:38,890 --> 02:19:39,290
Save.

2719
02:19:43,310 --> 02:19:44,110
Nishizawa-san.

2720
02:19:45,470 --> 02:19:47,270
And I'll be honest, like...

2721
02:19:47,870 --> 02:19:48,950
I like this artist.

2722
02:19:49,170 --> 02:19:50,830
I'm not like a die-hard fan.

2723
02:19:51,030 --> 02:19:52,490
But I just thought the figure was so cool.

2724
02:19:54,310 --> 02:19:55,670
Like look how cool that is!

2725
02:19:56,550 --> 02:19:58,450
And like she's coming through the tablet.

2726
02:20:00,070 --> 02:20:00,850
It's so awesome.

2727
02:20:01,350 --> 02:20:02,370
Oh my gosh.

2728
02:20:02,370 --> 02:20:02,910
Thank you for...

2729
02:20:03,310 --> 02:20:03,770
50!

2730
02:20:04,090 --> 02:20:04,690
Please!

2731
02:20:05,810 --> 02:20:07,810
You've already given so many today!

2732
02:20:09,670 --> 02:20:11,010
It's awesome, right?

2733
02:20:11,170 --> 02:20:12,010
It's really cool.

2734
02:20:12,350 --> 02:20:13,370
It's really, really cool.

2735
02:20:15,290 --> 02:20:15,890
Um...

2736
02:20:15,890 --> 02:20:17,710
I don't have...

2737
02:20:17,710 --> 02:20:21,070
When I collect figures, it's either something like this.

2738
02:20:21,090 --> 02:20:21,490
You know?

2739
02:20:21,810 --> 02:20:24,550
Or like a character I super duper love.

2740
02:20:24,790 --> 02:20:26,450
But I'll get stuff.

2741
02:20:26,650 --> 02:20:29,450
There's one figure that I missed out on.

2742
02:20:30,130 --> 02:20:31,190
And uh...

2743
02:20:33,310 --> 02:20:34,210
Can I get more?

2744
02:20:34,430 --> 02:20:34,650
No!

2745
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:38,110
I appreciate it though.

2746
02:20:38,150 --> 02:20:38,590
Thank you.

2747
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:41,350
There was one figure of like a girl.

2748
02:20:41,550 --> 02:20:41,930
Oh!

2749
02:20:42,010 --> 02:20:42,730
I found the picture.

2750
02:20:42,870 --> 02:20:43,230
Oh my gosh.

2751
02:20:43,350 --> 02:20:44,870
How am I so good at finding these pictures?

2752
02:20:45,250 --> 02:20:46,590
She's in a box.

2753
02:20:47,470 --> 02:20:48,410
Like look at this.

2754
02:20:48,570 --> 02:20:49,810
I should've ordered it.

2755
02:20:49,910 --> 02:20:50,630
I'm such a fool.

2756
02:20:52,050 --> 02:20:53,510
Look how cool this looks.

2757
02:20:53,950 --> 02:20:54,390
Oh!

2758
02:20:54,650 --> 02:20:57,310
I was gonna say she looks like Rei from Evangelion.

2759
02:20:58,190 --> 02:20:59,410
Like isn't it so...

2760
02:20:59,410 --> 02:21:01,590
It looks so cool!

2761
02:21:03,190 --> 02:21:03,750
Like...

2762
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:05,830
I really like unique...

2763
02:21:06,870 --> 02:21:08,330
Kind of figures like this.

2764
02:21:09,330 --> 02:21:10,710
It looks so cool.

2765
02:21:11,150 --> 02:21:12,690
It's not a cardboard box though.

2766
02:21:12,750 --> 02:21:14,190
It is not a cardboard box.

2767
02:21:14,390 --> 02:21:14,570
No.

2768
02:21:14,830 --> 02:21:16,750
And then I ordered one recently.

2769
02:21:17,410 --> 02:21:19,130
I don't know when it comes out.

2770
02:21:20,110 --> 02:21:20,670
Um...

2771
02:21:20,670 --> 02:21:22,010
But uh...

2772
02:21:23,530 --> 02:21:25,210
It's a Yuru Camp figure.

2773
02:21:27,210 --> 02:21:29,230
It's actually technically two figures.

2774
02:21:29,870 --> 02:21:31,310
Because it's both of them.

2775
02:21:33,070 --> 02:21:34,090
And look at this.

2776
02:21:34,250 --> 02:21:35,090
Look at this.

2777
02:21:35,130 --> 02:21:35,590
Look at this.

2778
02:21:42,530 --> 02:21:44,530
The base is grass!

2779
02:21:45,590 --> 02:21:47,030
I can touch grass!

2780
02:21:47,430 --> 02:21:48,810
By touching this figure!

2781
02:21:50,630 --> 02:21:51,110
Wait.

2782
02:21:51,170 --> 02:21:52,210
Did you gift another 50?

2783
02:21:53,850 --> 02:21:54,670
I can't tell.

2784
02:21:54,930 --> 02:21:56,110
If you did, thank you.

2785
02:21:56,110 --> 02:21:57,870
You did!

2786
02:21:58,590 --> 02:21:59,550
Thank you.

2787
02:22:01,790 --> 02:22:02,750
Thank you.

2788
02:22:03,850 --> 02:22:04,410
Actual...

2789
02:22:04,410 --> 02:22:05,450
It's not actual grass.

2790
02:22:05,750 --> 02:22:06,910
It's fake real grass.

2791
02:22:08,810 --> 02:22:10,450
It's fake real grass.

2792
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:11,830
But it's so cute, right?

2793
02:22:12,030 --> 02:22:13,150
She's riding on her little bike.

2794
02:22:13,350 --> 02:22:14,710
It's such a cute figure.

2795
02:22:15,770 --> 02:22:16,710
So cute.

2796
02:22:18,570 --> 02:22:19,130
Yeah.

2797
02:22:21,570 --> 02:22:22,130
So...

2798
02:22:22,890 --> 02:22:24,490
I have that coming...

2799
02:22:24,490 --> 02:22:25,610
When is it released?

2800
02:22:25,870 --> 02:22:26,430
In August.

2801
02:22:28,650 --> 02:22:29,550
In August.

2802
02:22:29,550 --> 02:22:29,650
August.

2803
02:22:31,370 --> 02:22:32,270
I will not.

2804
02:22:32,830 --> 02:22:34,790
And she's drinking corn soup.

2805
02:22:36,010 --> 02:22:36,850
In the...

2806
02:22:36,850 --> 02:22:38,010
On the figure.

2807
02:22:38,510 --> 02:22:40,130
It's just made for me, I think.

2808
02:22:41,930 --> 02:22:43,030
It's made for me.

2809
02:22:45,230 --> 02:22:46,470
You watched Yuru Camp?

2810
02:22:46,750 --> 02:22:47,210
Yes!

2811
02:22:47,250 --> 02:22:48,890
Yuru Camp is one of my favorite anime!

2812
02:22:50,070 --> 02:22:51,350
Yes, I love Yuru Camp.

2813
02:22:51,750 --> 02:22:53,430
Trying to see what else I have ordered.

2814
02:22:57,330 --> 02:22:59,310
Well, actually, I don't have that much left.

2815
02:22:59,370 --> 02:23:01,330
I think that's the biggest thing I have...

2816
02:23:02,330 --> 02:23:02,750
left.

2817
02:23:05,910 --> 02:23:06,330
Yes.

2818
02:23:06,470 --> 02:23:09,030
The other stuff is like a small free-rin acrylic.

2819
02:23:10,210 --> 02:23:10,630
The other stuff is like a small free-rin acrylic.

2820
02:23:10,690 --> 02:23:11,110
And...

2821
02:23:11,810 --> 02:23:13,190
Oh, I got this too!

2822
02:23:14,050 --> 02:23:15,090
This is really cute.

2823
02:23:16,550 --> 02:23:18,270
And it wasn't so expensive either.

2824
02:23:20,190 --> 02:23:21,030
Even though it was...

2825
02:23:21,030 --> 02:23:22,190
I think it's that they're really small.

2826
02:23:23,430 --> 02:23:24,310
Look how cute!

2827
02:23:24,570 --> 02:23:27,450
It's just little busts of the free-rin cast!

2828
02:23:28,670 --> 02:23:29,950
It's so cute!

2829
02:23:31,650 --> 02:23:32,250
It's so cute!

2830
02:23:32,250 --> 02:23:34,430
They're like tiny little busts of them.

2831
02:23:34,650 --> 02:23:34,850
They're like tiny little busts of them.

2832
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:39,210
So cute, so cute.

2833
02:23:40,530 --> 02:23:41,470
The trio.

2834
02:23:44,250 --> 02:23:45,450
Feminine shambles.

2835
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:47,930
Looks like chess pieces.

2836
02:23:48,230 --> 02:23:51,150
I think, to be honest, they might be even that small.

2837
02:23:51,530 --> 02:23:52,730
But that's good.

2838
02:23:52,810 --> 02:23:53,250
That's okay.

2839
02:23:53,430 --> 02:23:54,550
It's good for like a...

2840
02:23:55,590 --> 02:23:56,930
I don't know where to put them yet.

2841
02:23:58,730 --> 02:23:59,710
I think I...

2842
02:23:59,710 --> 02:24:01,670
Oh my gosh!

2843
02:24:01,870 --> 02:24:02,470
Oh, stop!

2844
02:24:02,630 --> 02:24:03,990
I didn't notice the back!

2845
02:24:04,930 --> 02:24:06,770
No, I'm gonna cry...

2846
02:24:07,550 --> 02:24:09,610
No, I'm gonna cry...

2847
02:24:09,610 --> 02:24:11,130
You guys, look at the back!

2848
02:24:15,610 --> 02:24:16,570
No way!

2849
02:24:16,690 --> 02:24:19,430
I didn't notice it, but when I ordered it...

2850
02:24:19,430 --> 02:24:20,110
What?

2851
02:24:20,250 --> 02:24:21,150
That's so cute!

2852
02:24:23,670 --> 02:24:24,430
Oh...

2853
02:24:27,110 --> 02:24:27,770
It's so...

2854
02:24:30,090 --> 02:24:31,870
I'm tearing up.

2855
02:24:31,890 --> 02:24:32,630
It's so sweet.

2856
02:24:35,590 --> 02:24:36,890
That's so cute.

2857
02:24:41,730 --> 02:24:44,030
Figures are so expensive now, you guys.

2858
02:24:44,550 --> 02:24:46,570
Figures are so expensive.

2859
02:24:46,650 --> 02:24:48,370
Not only just the...

2860
02:24:49,410 --> 02:24:50,810
The shipping.

2861
02:24:51,890 --> 02:24:52,650
But...

2862
02:24:53,430 --> 02:24:54,510
Like...

2863
02:24:54,510 --> 02:24:56,630
Scale figures now...

2864
02:24:56,630 --> 02:24:59,110
They used to be $150.

2865
02:24:59,430 --> 02:25:00,490
Maybe $100.

2866
02:25:01,150 --> 02:25:02,910
$100 to $150.

2867
02:25:02,970 --> 02:25:04,890
Now they're like $200, $300.

2868
02:25:05,150 --> 02:25:06,170
It's crazy!

2869
02:25:07,410 --> 02:25:08,390
Ugh...

2870
02:25:09,380 --> 02:25:11,050
I remember when they were $80.

2871
02:25:11,230 --> 02:25:13,890
They're so expensive now.

2872
02:25:14,210 --> 02:25:15,110
They're so expensive now.

2873
02:25:15,110 --> 02:25:15,850
It's so...

2874
02:25:15,850 --> 02:25:17,370
So insane.

2875
02:25:20,470 --> 02:25:22,670
The ones I like are not $300.

2876
02:25:23,170 --> 02:25:23,270
The ones I like are not $300.

2877
02:25:23,710 --> 02:25:24,690
Are they more?

2878
02:25:24,950 --> 02:25:25,410
Less?

2879
02:25:25,730 --> 02:25:26,950
I can't tell what you mean by that.

2880
02:25:27,610 --> 02:25:29,650
Include shipping and it goes close to $300.

2881
02:25:30,310 --> 02:25:31,950
Luckily... I say this luckily...

2882
02:25:31,950 --> 02:25:33,550
Not luckily, but like...

2883
02:25:33,550 --> 02:25:35,990
The yen is weak right now, so...

2884
02:25:35,990 --> 02:25:39,370
It's the way I justify some things, but...

2885
02:25:40,690 --> 02:25:41,650
It's the way I justify some things, but...

2886
02:25:42,210 --> 02:25:42,690
No...

2887
02:25:43,350 --> 02:25:44,690
They're so pricey.

2888
02:25:45,450 --> 02:25:46,550
Makes me...

2889
02:25:46,550 --> 02:25:47,150
Like...

2890
02:25:48,530 --> 02:25:49,110
Um...

2891
02:25:49,770 --> 02:25:52,190
Like Pop-Up Parade is kind of a blessing.

2892
02:25:53,030 --> 02:25:54,070
With how...

2893
02:25:54,070 --> 02:25:55,370
Inexpensive it is.

2894
02:25:55,430 --> 02:25:57,050
And the range too.

2895
02:25:57,130 --> 02:25:59,570
The variety of characters you can get with Pop-Up Parade.

2896
02:26:00,210 --> 02:26:01,430
Makes it so awesome.

2897
02:26:11,330 --> 02:26:12,490
But yeah...

2898
02:26:13,610 --> 02:26:14,810
Nendoroids used to be $30.

2899
02:26:14,910 --> 02:26:15,390
I know!

2900
02:26:16,110 --> 02:26:18,290
Nendoroids and Figma's used to be...

2901
02:26:18,290 --> 02:26:19,190
So...

2902
02:26:19,190 --> 02:26:21,530
Much less expensive too!

2903
02:26:22,030 --> 02:26:24,750
I saw a holo figure going for $1.3k.

2904
02:26:24,970 --> 02:26:25,530
Okay...

2905
02:26:25,530 --> 02:26:26,830
To be fair...

2906
02:26:26,830 --> 02:26:29,730
If it's the Pekora one you're talking about...

2907
02:26:29,730 --> 02:26:30,350
Um...

2908
02:26:32,030 --> 02:26:33,150
I think...

2909
02:26:33,150 --> 02:26:36,270
Okay, so I'm pretty sure it's the same brand that does...

2910
02:26:36,270 --> 02:26:38,110
These kimono designs.

2911
02:26:38,610 --> 02:26:40,070
And it's actual fabric.

2912
02:26:40,390 --> 02:26:41,550
From what I understand.

2913
02:26:42,490 --> 02:26:43,950
So I get it.

2914
02:26:44,050 --> 02:26:45,470
It's actually like...

2915
02:26:46,830 --> 02:26:48,070
The quality.

2916
02:26:48,530 --> 02:26:50,530
But it is still insane.

2917
02:26:50,670 --> 02:26:52,050
And it's also 1 4th scale.

2918
02:26:52,330 --> 02:26:53,770
It's 1 4th scale too.

2919
02:26:53,950 --> 02:26:55,170
It's not even like 1 7th.

2920
02:26:55,230 --> 02:26:56,130
It's huge.

2921
02:26:56,490 --> 02:26:57,950
It's really really big.

2922
02:26:58,530 --> 02:26:59,150
So...

2923
02:27:01,670 --> 02:27:02,290
Yeah...

2924
02:27:02,290 --> 02:27:04,450
It's a lot of money.

2925
02:27:04,550 --> 02:27:05,150
But...

2926
02:27:05,150 --> 02:27:08,110
It is quite big and detailed.

2927
02:27:08,490 --> 02:27:09,190
I've seen...

2928
02:27:09,190 --> 02:27:10,890
I know because I've seen these...

2929
02:27:12,490 --> 02:27:13,130
These designs multiple times.

2930
02:27:13,170 --> 02:27:15,330
They pop up pretty often on AmiAmi.

2931
02:27:15,470 --> 02:27:15,810
So...

2932
02:27:16,290 --> 02:27:17,890
Do you have any 1 4th scales?

2933
02:27:19,150 --> 02:27:19,630
No...

2934
02:27:19,630 --> 02:27:20,870
I don't know.

2935
02:27:21,770 --> 02:27:25,110
I have a bigger Kuroneko from Oreimo.

2936
02:27:26,050 --> 02:27:28,010
But I don't know what scale she is.

2937
02:27:30,130 --> 02:27:31,650
But she's a little bigger.

2938
02:27:31,750 --> 02:27:32,870
But I don't think she's 1 4th.

2939
02:27:43,550 --> 02:27:44,510
Or maybe she is.

2940
02:27:46,370 --> 02:27:47,650
Maybe she is 1 4th.

2941
02:27:49,770 --> 02:27:50,650
Maybe she is 1 4th.

2942
02:27:50,650 --> 02:27:51,590
Oh she is 1 4th.

2943
02:27:54,510 --> 02:27:55,270
What do you know?

2944
02:28:01,130 --> 02:28:02,290
She's 1 4th.

2945
02:28:02,330 --> 02:28:03,750
So mine is 1 4th.

2946
02:28:03,750 --> 02:28:04,670
And she's on her knees.

2947
02:28:05,130 --> 02:28:07,210
And this Pekora is standing up.

2948
02:28:07,310 --> 02:28:10,910
If that gives you any idea of how big it's going to be.

2949
02:28:11,050 --> 02:28:12,390
Like it's going to be really really big.

2950
02:28:13,910 --> 02:28:16,150
Yoshitoku does the fabric for the Pekora figure.

2951
02:28:16,850 --> 02:28:19,090
They've made doll clothes for over 100 years.

2952
02:28:19,230 --> 02:28:21,250
But the mark up between those anime figures.

2953
02:28:21,430 --> 02:28:23,590
And the traditional dolls is massively skewed.

2954
02:28:23,670 --> 02:28:25,150
That makes sense.

2955
02:28:25,290 --> 02:28:30,370
I don't know if it's the same manufacturer.

2956
02:28:31,070 --> 02:28:31,250
I don't know if it's the same manufacturer.

2957
02:28:31,250 --> 02:28:31,990
Or the same...

2958
02:28:31,990 --> 02:28:32,090
Or the same...

2959
02:28:32,090 --> 02:28:33,530
Like company.

2960
02:28:35,270 --> 02:28:36,330
I don't know.

2961
02:28:38,370 --> 02:28:39,510
As the other ones.

2962
02:28:39,690 --> 02:28:40,070
Let me see.

2963
02:28:40,810 --> 02:28:41,290
Pekora!

2964
02:28:45,170 --> 02:28:45,970
Yoshitoku... Yoshitoku...

2965
02:28:47,730 --> 02:28:49,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

2966
02:28:49,510 --> 02:28:54,290
Okay, the Pekora one is a lot more expensive than, like...

2967
02:28:54,290 --> 02:28:55,530
Okay, wait, no, that one's on sale.

2968
02:28:55,930 --> 02:28:59,130
Okay, see, here, I'm gonna show you some other examples, ones that I've seen.

2969
02:29:00,350 --> 02:29:08,570
Because she's also 1 4th scale, you have... I think it's really just their anime figures, then, if you're saying that the other ones are less...

2970
02:29:08,570 --> 02:29:13,670
Like, their actual dolls are less expensive, because I've seen this... this, um...

2971
02:29:14,470 --> 02:29:15,310
Maid Dragon one.

2972
02:29:16,830 --> 02:29:17,750
Dragon Maid.

2973
02:29:18,830 --> 02:29:20,510
Uh, this one is...

2974
02:29:21,390 --> 02:29:25,330
Uh, one is... it's... yeah, uh, wait...

2975
02:29:25,330 --> 02:29:31,030
Uh, it's... it's 157,000 yen.

2976
02:29:31,530 --> 02:29:35,550
So, uh, AmiAmi says it's about a thousand dollars, and that's on sale.

2977
02:29:36,890 --> 02:29:38,490
So there's that one...

2978
02:29:38,570 --> 02:29:40,730
And, uh, let's see...

2979
02:29:40,730 --> 02:29:43,190
I haven't seen this one, but I'm...

2980
02:29:43,190 --> 02:29:45,150
Oh, oh, it's so beautiful!

2981
02:29:45,430 --> 02:29:46,650
Oh, my God!

2982
02:29:47,410 --> 02:29:49,170
Oh, my God, it's so beautiful!

2983
02:29:49,870 --> 02:29:51,550
Wait, is this also 1 4th?

2984
02:29:51,670 --> 02:29:52,390
Oh, yes, it is.

2985
02:29:52,510 --> 02:29:56,550
Oh, this one's about the same price as the... as the Pekora one.

2986
02:29:58,370 --> 02:29:59,350
Oh, my God!

2987
02:30:00,110 --> 02:30:01,070
Look at her!

2988
02:30:02,710 --> 02:30:03,770
Look at her!

2989
02:30:03,870 --> 02:30:04,890
Oh, my gosh!

2990
02:30:04,890 --> 02:30:06,410
Oh, no, she's so beautiful!

2991
02:30:09,430 --> 02:30:10,590
She's so beautiful!

2992
02:30:13,870 --> 02:30:14,310
Ugh!

2993
02:30:14,770 --> 02:30:16,750
But, yeah, they do quite a bit of these.

2994
02:30:17,690 --> 02:30:20,810
And they are always this pricey, every time I've seen them.

2995
02:30:22,230 --> 02:30:24,570
Every time I've seen them, they're this pricey.

2996
02:30:26,010 --> 02:30:28,530
I saw the thumbnail and thought you had a collab with Korone.

2997
02:30:29,870 --> 02:30:31,030
A lot of people thought!

2998
02:30:31,310 --> 02:30:34,170
Time zones make it hard to catch streams, but we'll support you regardless.

2999
02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:36,310
Also want to mention you have a nice voice.

3000
02:30:36,430 --> 02:30:37,330
Take care from Australia!

3001
02:30:38,610 --> 02:30:40,250
Thank you so much!

3002
02:30:40,470 --> 02:30:44,870
I'm sorry that the time zones don't line up, but I appreciate you dropping by when you can.

3003
02:30:45,550 --> 02:30:46,650
Thank you, thank you.

3004
02:30:47,870 --> 02:30:48,930
Thank you so much.

3005
02:30:49,050 --> 02:30:49,850
I really appreciate it.

3006
02:30:50,410 --> 02:30:53,630
When are we getting a $1,300 made min figure?

3007
02:30:57,750 --> 02:30:58,210
Never.

3008
02:31:02,970 --> 02:31:04,670
And there's a Kizuna Ai one, too.

3009
02:31:04,950 --> 02:31:05,610
It's really...

3010
02:31:05,610 --> 02:31:07,310
Their figures are really, really cute.

3011
02:31:07,310 --> 02:31:07,670
It's really beautiful.

3012
02:31:08,170 --> 02:31:10,090
This one's also 1-4th scale.

3013
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:12,070
Oh my gosh.

3014
02:31:12,430 --> 02:31:14,550
Their figures are just really pretty.

3015
02:31:16,010 --> 02:31:19,390
If you go to AmiAmi and search...

3016
02:31:20,050 --> 02:31:20,330
Oops.

3017
02:31:21,330 --> 02:31:22,450
And search...

3018
02:31:24,710 --> 02:31:25,270
Yoshitoku?

3019
02:31:25,810 --> 02:31:27,150
Yoshitoku, you'll find them.

3020
02:31:32,850 --> 02:31:36,070
Any survey from Good Smile, I'm going to be asking for min.

3021
02:31:36,070 --> 02:31:37,750
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3022
02:31:38,270 --> 02:31:40,130
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3023
02:31:41,250 --> 02:31:42,290
No, no, no, no.

3024
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:47,420
Yeah.

3025
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:50,960
Figures are so expensive.

3026
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:53,180
These ones I...

3027
02:31:53,180 --> 02:31:53,680
I...

3028
02:31:54,220 --> 02:31:54,860
I know...

3029
02:31:54,860 --> 02:31:58,020
It might be like a weird copium, but I kind of get it.

3030
02:31:58,100 --> 02:31:59,120
Just because of the fabric.

3031
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:00,620
You'd think that!

3032
02:32:02,200 --> 02:32:02,760
Well, no.

3033
02:32:03,480 --> 02:32:06,480
Yeah, because of the fabric and because of the scale.

3034
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:07,460
The size of them.

3035
02:32:08,300 --> 02:32:09,600
It is an expensive hobby.

3036
02:32:09,800 --> 02:32:10,420
It is.

3037
02:32:11,500 --> 02:32:12,300
It is.

3038
02:32:12,380 --> 02:32:13,780
It's a very expensive hobby.

3039
02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:16,800
I think it's also partially why...

3040
02:32:17,820 --> 02:32:20,080
Maybe I haven't gotten into so...

3041
02:32:20,080 --> 02:32:22,880
Well, not why I haven't gotten into so many anime, but like...

3042
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:25,380
Part of me is just like, if I get into more things...

3043
02:32:25,380 --> 02:32:27,620
I'll want to collect more merch from the things.

3044
02:32:27,740 --> 02:32:28,340
You know what I mean?

3045
02:32:28,520 --> 02:32:30,220
So it's just like...

3046
02:32:30,220 --> 02:32:31,480
Like last night...

3047
02:32:31,480 --> 02:32:34,120
Right now, Tsurugaya is doing free shipping.

3048
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:37,420
So I was looking at some Metal Gear stuff last night.

3049
02:32:37,420 --> 02:32:37,520
And I was like...

3050
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:38,920
Damn, it's sale!

3051
02:32:39,080 --> 02:32:40,200
Thank you for the 50k!

3052
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:42,300
Thank you so much!

3053
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:44,220
Thank you!

3054
02:32:44,480 --> 02:32:45,480
Thank you, thank you!

3055
02:32:47,440 --> 02:32:48,040
But...

3056
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:51,900
Beware Warhammer then.

3057
02:32:54,740 --> 02:32:58,060
I would say that Warhammer is not really my aesthetic.

3058
02:32:58,660 --> 02:32:59,260
But...

3059
02:32:59,260 --> 02:33:00,840
Well, you know...

3060
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:02,580
I like military aesthetic.

3061
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:03,500
So...

3062
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:07,240
It's not completely far off that I got into Metal Gear.

3063
02:33:10,580 --> 02:33:12,400
But yeah, I was on Tsurugaya.

3064
02:33:12,760 --> 02:33:15,680
And I was seeing some Blue Archive figures.

3065
02:33:15,860 --> 02:33:17,220
And I was like...

3066
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:25,640
Now it's free shipping, but...

3067
02:33:26,460 --> 02:33:27,420
The pain...

3068
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:28,400
In the end...

3069
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:29,500
If you're wondering...

3070
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:30,320
I did not get anything.

3071
02:33:31,540 --> 02:33:33,660
I did not get any of them.

3072
02:33:33,900 --> 02:33:34,140
So...

3073
02:33:34,140 --> 02:33:35,340
One fourth scale.

3074
02:33:35,400 --> 02:33:36,780
Dang, almost as tall as you!

3075
02:33:45,560 --> 02:33:46,740
That's a good one!

3076
02:33:48,380 --> 02:33:49,760
Good one, floofy hoots!

3077
02:33:52,460 --> 02:33:53,420
So hilarious!

3078
02:34:07,250 --> 02:34:08,690
I'm LMAO-ing right now.

3079
02:34:08,750 --> 02:34:09,990
I'm LMFAO-ing right now.

3080
02:34:21,610 --> 02:34:23,170
I'm ROFL-ing right now.

3081
02:34:26,840 --> 02:34:28,660
Funniest joke I've ever heard.

3082
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:31,300
ROFL ROFL ROFL.

3083
02:34:33,660 --> 02:34:34,820
I don't feel safe.

3084
02:34:34,960 --> 02:34:36,180
ROFL-copter.

3085
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:40,080
Literally ROFL-coptering.

3086
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,340
How do I turn?

3087
02:34:49,020 --> 02:34:49,780
Help!

3088
02:34:52,540 --> 02:34:53,080
Help!

3089
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:53,980
Help me!

3090
02:34:54,100 --> 02:34:54,740
Help me!

3091
02:34:58,960 --> 02:34:59,700
Help me!

3092
02:35:01,260 --> 02:35:02,140
Help me!

3093
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:02,820
Help me!

3094
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:05,540
Hmm.

3095
02:35:08,610 --> 02:35:08,690
I have no idea what to write in here.

3096
02:35:08,690 --> 02:35:09,650
That was scary...

3097
02:35:10,670 --> 02:35:11,550
I don't know what to write in here.

3098
02:35:11,550 --> 02:35:12,530
That was freaky.

3099
02:35:13,430 --> 02:35:14,250
I don't know what the front page is.

3100
02:35:14,250 --> 02:35:14,550
That was freaky.

3101
02:35:14,730 --> 02:35:14,950
Freaky.

3102
02:35:15,110 --> 02:35:15,550
Okay.

3103
02:35:15,650 --> 02:35:17,050
I did say I was gonna do donation readings.

3104
02:35:17,210 --> 02:35:17,550
So...

3105
02:35:17,550 --> 02:35:18,530
Let me...

3106
02:35:18,530 --> 02:35:20,110
I'm going to start with Extreme Labs.

3107
02:35:20,470 --> 02:35:22,130
I got the tightest laugh treatment.

3108
02:35:22,370 --> 02:35:23,550
I'm so happy.

3109
02:35:24,770 --> 02:35:25,210
Glad.

3110
02:35:25,450 --> 02:35:27,470
I'm glad that I can make that real for you.

3111
02:35:29,070 --> 02:35:29,510
I did.

3112
02:35:29,510 --> 02:35:30,970
I need to get some water.

3113
02:35:32,010 --> 02:35:33,090
Water, water, water.

3114
02:35:35,070 --> 02:35:36,470
Today is the 14th.

3115
02:35:38,570 --> 02:35:39,370
Starting with...

3116
02:35:39,910 --> 02:35:40,550
Wildest Duck.

3117
02:35:40,730 --> 02:35:42,090
I think this was before stream.

3118
02:35:42,910 --> 02:35:43,710
Thank you!

3119
02:35:46,010 --> 02:35:48,610
I hope we can help a little so you can keep having fun, Gamba!

3120
02:35:48,910 --> 02:35:49,950
Thank you so much!

3121
02:35:50,010 --> 02:35:50,890
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3122
02:35:52,010 --> 02:35:53,050
Wildest Duck, thank you again!

3123
02:35:54,190 --> 02:35:56,150
Congrats on your collab with Korone.

3124
02:35:56,410 --> 02:35:58,270
You must have given her so many yubies.

3125
02:35:58,450 --> 02:35:59,690
She's so quiet now.

3126
02:35:59,770 --> 02:36:01,950
Can't wait for when she's done with them.

3127
02:36:02,330 --> 02:36:06,010
Yeah, she was just kinda You know, you heard her the whole time, right?

3128
02:36:06,050 --> 02:36:07,910
You heard her say yubi yubi.

3129
02:36:08,130 --> 02:36:10,610
You heard her say shotgun.

3130
02:36:12,850 --> 02:36:14,890
Being a Blue Archive fan is painful.

3131
02:36:15,010 --> 02:36:15,990
There's too many characters.

3132
02:36:18,890 --> 02:36:22,030
I have only a handful of characters that I really like, though.

3133
02:36:23,190 --> 02:36:24,070
Just a handful.

3134
02:36:24,270 --> 02:36:26,970
And that's typically how I am with a lot of things.

3135
02:36:28,310 --> 02:36:36,990
Where if there's a ton of characters or something, or if it's an idol group with a ton of members or something, I'll pick, like, just a few.

3136
02:36:38,370 --> 02:36:39,250
Top five?

3137
02:36:44,430 --> 02:36:45,310
Top five...

3138
02:36:46,510 --> 02:36:47,850
Okay, um...

3139
02:36:49,930 --> 02:36:51,850
Hold on, I'm just gonna open up Blue Archive.

3140
02:36:54,090 --> 02:36:56,390
I haven't logged in today anyway, so it's good.

3141
02:37:01,060 --> 02:37:03,400
Um, definitely Koharu's up there.

3142
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:05,920
Koharu and Cherino are, like, my top two.

3143
02:37:08,060 --> 02:37:09,620
I love them so much.

3144
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:10,980
Koharu and Cherino.

3145
02:37:11,160 --> 02:37:12,600
Cherino is so...

3146
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:13,500
I love...

3147
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:14,840
She's so funny.

3148
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:15,380
I love her.

3149
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:18,680
I love Koharu.

3150
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:23,100
Because she's, like, she's actually, like, peak character design.

3151
02:37:23,420 --> 02:37:28,220
She is... I don't know how they could get so many cute things so perfectly.

3152
02:37:28,620 --> 02:37:30,480
Balanced and well in one character.

3153
02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:32,780
Just so cute.

3154
02:37:33,240 --> 02:37:36,000
I think Cherino is underrated.

3155
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:38,920
But she's super duper cute.

3156
02:37:39,060 --> 02:37:39,720
She's so silly.

3157
02:37:40,880 --> 02:37:42,160
Mahjong Soul Stream?

3158
02:37:42,480 --> 02:37:44,000
I don't even know how to play Mahjong.

3159
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:47,300
Though I did try to learn from Mahjong Soul before.

3160
02:37:48,280 --> 02:37:49,280
Okay, let's see.

3161
02:37:49,880 --> 02:37:55,420
The screen that popped up is Onsen Cherino for me.

3162
02:37:55,500 --> 02:37:56,140
Okay, students.

3163
02:37:56,680 --> 02:37:59,320
Um, I also really love Toki.

3164
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:01,920
Um, and Hina.

3165
02:38:02,060 --> 02:38:03,800
I love Hina and I love Toki.

3166
02:38:05,480 --> 02:38:10,440
Um, wait, so that's Koharu, Hina, Toki, Cherino.

3167
02:38:10,560 --> 02:38:10,920
That's four?

3168
02:38:12,300 --> 02:38:12,700
Um...

3169
02:38:14,200 --> 02:38:17,100
I really like Hoshino, but I wouldn't put her in my top five.

3170
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:19,960
Um, I really like, um...

3171
02:38:21,060 --> 02:38:23,600
Uh, I really like Midori and, um...

3172
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:27,360
Oh my gosh, why is her sister's name blanking on me?

3173
02:38:32,610 --> 02:38:33,610
What's her sister's name?

3174
02:38:35,270 --> 02:38:35,750
Momoi!

3175
02:38:35,930 --> 02:38:36,970
Yes, oh my gosh.

3176
02:38:37,110 --> 02:38:38,070
I was just like...

3177
02:38:39,090 --> 02:38:40,790
Of course, Momoi, Momoi.

3178
02:38:40,990 --> 02:38:46,670
I was like, I feel so awful not remembering, or not remembering it because, um...

3179
02:38:47,750 --> 02:38:48,230
Because...

3180
02:38:48,790 --> 02:38:49,550
Momoi Haruko.

3181
02:38:50,230 --> 02:38:52,750
I always think of Momoi Haruko every time I think of Momoi.

3182
02:38:53,890 --> 02:38:55,210
Which clearly is not enough.

3183
02:38:55,710 --> 02:38:57,610
Um, I also really like Arisu.

3184
02:38:57,890 --> 02:39:00,110
I like the whole game dev team, to be honest.

3185
02:39:00,470 --> 02:39:02,670
Um, gamer cat twins are the best.

3186
02:39:02,790 --> 02:39:03,730
They're so cute.

3187
02:39:03,990 --> 02:39:07,030
Oh my gosh, the new twins that were released in JP.

3188
02:39:09,290 --> 02:39:09,770
Fuuu...

3189
02:39:09,770 --> 02:39:11,230
They're so cute.

3190
02:39:12,350 --> 02:39:14,370
Problem solver 68 girls are great.

3191
02:39:14,450 --> 02:39:14,750
They are!

3192
02:39:15,830 --> 02:39:16,850
They are, they are.

3193
02:39:17,090 --> 02:39:19,210
I really like Aru too, but I don't have her.

3194
02:39:20,370 --> 02:39:21,670
I really love Aru.

3195
02:39:24,590 --> 02:39:25,070
Um...

3196
02:39:26,950 --> 02:39:28,310
Making me want to play.

3197
02:39:28,550 --> 02:39:28,970
Sorry.

3198
02:39:29,170 --> 02:39:30,710
The Blue Archive talk, everybody.

3199
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:32,890
You can ignore if you're not in the Blue Archive.

3200
02:39:34,550 --> 02:39:35,030
Uh...

3201
02:39:35,670 --> 02:39:37,030
But it's like the only gacha.

3202
02:39:37,130 --> 02:39:37,190
Oh!

3203
02:39:37,510 --> 02:39:37,990
Shiroko!

3204
02:39:38,130 --> 02:39:38,650
Of course!

3205
02:39:38,710 --> 02:39:42,730
I have to put in Shiroko because she's voiced by my favorite seiyuu.

3206
02:39:43,090 --> 02:39:43,930
Ogura Yui.

3207
02:39:44,890 --> 02:39:46,430
She's actual tenshi.

3208
02:39:46,510 --> 02:39:47,090
Ogura Yui.

3209
02:39:47,630 --> 02:39:49,710
Pyon pyon kyuku dere supremacy.

3210
02:39:53,130 --> 02:39:53,970
Peace, peace.

3211
02:39:55,650 --> 02:39:58,130
I also love how goofy Shiroko is.

3212
02:39:58,430 --> 02:39:59,410
She's so fun.

3213
02:39:59,850 --> 02:40:00,890
Because she's...

3214
02:40:00,890 --> 02:40:05,150
She's like a kudere, but she's so... so silly.

3215
02:40:05,350 --> 02:40:06,390
At the same time.

3216
02:40:07,230 --> 02:40:08,770
You're gonna love the dress, Aru.

3217
02:40:09,470 --> 02:40:09,990
Yeah.

3218
02:40:10,530 --> 02:40:11,490
Thoughts on Wakamo?

3219
02:40:11,650 --> 02:40:14,210
I really like Wakamo, but I don't have her.

3220
02:40:14,430 --> 02:40:17,370
So I don't know much about her.

3221
02:40:18,350 --> 02:40:22,170
Well, I know a little, but you know what I mean.

3222
02:40:23,510 --> 02:40:24,550
And um...

3223
02:40:25,070 --> 02:40:25,830
I also really like Saki.

3224
02:40:26,050 --> 02:40:28,490
I like the rabbit squad a lot because they're really cute.

3225
02:40:30,290 --> 02:40:30,730
Um...

3226
02:40:31,270 --> 02:40:33,230
Even though I only have Moe.

3227
02:40:35,430 --> 02:40:36,930
Um... I only have...

3228
02:40:36,930 --> 02:40:38,370
Oh wait, no, I have swimsuit Miyu.

3229
02:40:39,410 --> 02:40:41,230
And... oh wait, I have one more too.

3230
02:40:41,350 --> 02:40:41,790
Who is it?

3231
02:40:42,070 --> 02:40:42,510
Um...

3232
02:40:43,430 --> 02:40:44,310
Wait, do I?

3233
02:40:45,430 --> 02:40:45,870
Moe...

3234
02:40:46,470 --> 02:40:47,290
Oh, Miyako!

3235
02:40:49,570 --> 02:40:50,430
Swimsuit Miyako.

3236
02:40:50,930 --> 02:40:51,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3237
02:40:51,730 --> 02:40:52,490
Mmm.

3238
02:40:54,150 --> 02:40:56,410
I got Wakamo swimsuit, but not regular Wakamo.

3239
02:40:56,570 --> 02:40:57,190
I don't have either.

3240
02:40:57,470 --> 02:40:59,350
I don't have that many characters, to be honest.

3241
02:40:59,770 --> 02:41:00,670
That's so sad.

3242
02:41:01,010 --> 02:41:02,150
I don't have that many characters.

3243
02:41:02,590 --> 02:41:04,930
My gacha luck in this game is so garble.

3244
02:41:07,490 --> 02:41:07,970
Yeah.

3245
02:41:09,470 --> 02:41:11,690
But out of rabbit squad, I like, uh...

3246
02:41:11,690 --> 02:41:13,930
I like, um, Saki the most.

3247
02:41:13,970 --> 02:41:14,890
I really like her helmet.

3248
02:41:17,210 --> 02:41:18,130
Yes, yes.

3249
02:41:18,130 --> 02:41:18,390
Yes.

3250
02:41:19,270 --> 02:41:21,570
Need to poll on stream for streamer luck.

3251
02:41:23,530 --> 02:41:24,210
We'll see.

3252
02:41:24,470 --> 02:41:26,950
I only have 9000 gemies.

3253
02:41:28,990 --> 02:41:31,210
So I'm not doing any polling at the moment.

3254
02:41:32,510 --> 02:41:33,590
I am waiting.

3255
02:41:33,950 --> 02:41:34,810
Who is next?

3256
02:41:37,550 --> 02:41:38,070
Who...

3257
02:41:38,070 --> 02:41:39,650
What is... Who is next?

3258
02:41:40,770 --> 02:41:42,710
New twins are called Hikari and Nozomi?

3259
02:41:42,890 --> 02:41:43,070
Ah!

3260
02:41:43,250 --> 02:41:43,970
After the shink...

3261
02:41:43,970 --> 02:41:45,770
As soon as you said that, I knew!

3262
02:41:46,010 --> 02:41:47,030
The Shinkansen!

3263
02:41:48,130 --> 02:41:50,030
Oh no, that makes me like them even more!

3264
02:41:51,950 --> 02:41:53,730
Wait, Railgun collab is next?

3265
02:41:54,270 --> 02:41:54,670
Oh!

3266
02:41:56,230 --> 02:41:59,830
I never got Miku, so... Okay.

3267
02:42:01,490 --> 02:42:03,230
We'll save for Railgun.

3268
02:42:04,290 --> 02:42:06,750
Swimsuit Hina just came up on my screen.

3269
02:42:08,610 --> 02:42:09,150
Okay.

3270
02:42:09,710 --> 02:42:10,610
Where was I?

3271
02:42:12,290 --> 02:42:13,390
Rico, thank you!

3272
02:42:13,530 --> 02:42:14,470
Rico, thank you again!

3273
02:42:15,750 --> 02:42:16,710
Alex, thank you!

3274
02:42:16,930 --> 02:42:17,930
Go mint Nasa!

3275
02:42:19,350 --> 02:42:20,150
Kayvarn, thank you!

3276
02:42:22,070 --> 02:42:22,510
Pirate6...

3277
02:42:24,290 --> 02:42:24,730
Six,

3278
02:42:27,960 --> 02:42:28,380
thank you!

3279
02:42:30,460 --> 02:42:31,240
Chidontai, thank you!

3280
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:34,000
TheRockboss, thank you!

3281
02:42:34,340 --> 02:42:38,540
Thank you for the revengeance definition.

3282
02:42:38,540 --> 02:42:39,740
Now we know it's a real word.

3283
02:42:41,140 --> 02:42:42,060
Ludus, thank you!

3284
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:44,320
So more dono, more figures.

3285
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:44,700
No!

3286
02:42:47,460 --> 02:42:48,860
Oh my gosh, thank you for the pink dono!

3287
02:42:49,600 --> 02:42:50,780
No, no, no.

3288
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:58,980
I have just the... well, the Yudokan point is really expensive, so I have been holding off on pre-ordering anything else.

3289
02:43:01,640 --> 02:43:03,140
I was like, I will...

3290
02:43:03,140 --> 02:43:05,300
I am pacing myself!

3291
02:43:06,980 --> 02:43:07,860
Oh, there it is!

3292
02:43:08,880 --> 02:43:10,140
Thank you so much!

3293
02:43:10,260 --> 02:43:10,860
Thank you!

3294
02:43:10,900 --> 02:43:13,440
Thank you guys for all the stream- Thank you!

3295
02:43:16,060 --> 02:43:16,540
And...

3296
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:20,620
Superchats!

3297
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:21,620
Superchats!

3298
02:43:21,620 --> 02:43:22,220
Cha -cha-cha!

3299
02:43:22,900 --> 02:43:23,520
Superchats!

3300
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:28,740
Oh my gosh, guys, we are almost to 180,000!

3301
02:43:29,080 --> 02:43:33,040
And then, next, 190,000!

3302
02:43:33,080 --> 02:43:35,640
And then, maybe 200,000!

3303
02:43:38,760 --> 02:43:40,340
That'd be kinda crazy!

3304
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:46,780
That'd be a little lucky!

3305
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:48,500
If that happens!

3306
02:43:50,300 --> 02:43:52,400
Are you planning anything for 200,000?

3307
02:43:53,220 --> 02:43:53,740
Well...

3308
02:43:55,620 --> 02:43:56,140
I...

3309
02:43:56,140 --> 02:43:57,060
I didn't...

3310
02:43:57,060 --> 02:43:59,960
I didn't...

3311
02:44:00,600 --> 02:44:01,680
Well, I don't know.

3312
02:44:01,740 --> 02:44:03,280
I don't think we are going to get there so fast.

3313
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,720
But I didn't expect to get this far this fast.

3314
02:44:07,460 --> 02:44:07,980
So...

3315
02:44:08,540 --> 02:44:10,980
I guess I will plan something for 200,000.

3316
02:44:12,860 --> 02:44:14,480
I will plan something.

3317
02:44:15,420 --> 02:44:15,860
Hmm...

3318
02:44:15,860 --> 02:44:16,440
Hmm...

3319
02:44:17,960 --> 02:44:19,460
I already have some ideas.

3320
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:21,160
So...

3321
02:44:22,180 --> 02:44:23,140
Yes, yes, yes!

3322
02:44:23,640 --> 02:44:24,700
I already have some ideas.

3323
02:44:26,460 --> 02:44:31,820
And some of them, if I implement them, might take a little bit of long- a bit longer, so...

3324
02:44:32,360 --> 02:44:34,100
I have some time, which is good.

3325
02:44:34,680 --> 02:44:35,400
Oh my god!

3326
02:44:35,800 --> 02:44:37,500
The 50, thank you!

3327
02:44:39,080 --> 02:44:39,720
Okie dokie!

3328
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:41,240
As for Superchats...

3329
02:44:41,240 --> 02:44:42,260
Chiliax, thank you!

3330
02:44:42,520 --> 02:44:43,480
Murphy, hot dog!

3331
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:45,200
Raymac, hot dog!

3332
02:44:47,380 --> 02:44:48,220
Seymour, thank you!

3333
02:44:48,420 --> 02:44:50,580
We are all ready to hear YubiYubi multiple times.

3334
02:44:50,800 --> 02:44:52,820
Well, I hope you had your money's worth.

3335
02:44:54,500 --> 02:44:55,200
StarCreator, thank you!

3336
02:44:56,260 --> 02:44:57,420
Spank, hot dog!

3337
02:44:58,780 --> 02:44:59,860
ClaretFran, thank you!

3338
02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:01,120
Today is my birthday!

3339
02:45:01,260 --> 02:45:03,740
I wanted to share some joy with my Kamiyoshi ghost mate!

3340
02:45:04,060 --> 02:45:05,960
I have pistachio cake and fancy cookies.

3341
02:45:06,140 --> 02:45:07,420
Feel free to possess me and eat some!

3342
02:45:08,180 --> 02:45:09,980
I will... after stream.

3343
02:45:11,240 --> 02:45:12,160
if you feel a chill.

3344
02:45:12,580 --> 02:45:15,760
I'm an older lady now, I can't eat as many cookies as I used to.

3345
02:45:15,880 --> 02:45:17,940
Don't worry, I will eat some for you.

3346
02:45:19,660 --> 02:45:20,860
I'll have just a nibble.

3347
02:45:21,160 --> 02:45:22,500
Happy birthday, Claret!

3348
02:45:23,860 --> 02:45:26,480
Happy birthday to you!

3349
02:45:27,980 --> 02:45:30,580
Happy birthday to you!

3350
02:45:31,880 --> 02:45:35,600
Happy birthday dear ClaretFran!

3351
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:42,340
Happy birthday to you!

3352
02:45:44,460 --> 02:45:45,540
Happy birthday!

3353
02:45:49,140 --> 02:45:59,540
Even though I don't have much knowledge or understand much of anything you like, such as blue archive or your feet fetishes, I do like your energy and your passion for your hobbies.

3354
02:45:59,780 --> 02:46:02,060
Thanks for always being you for who you are.

3355
02:46:04,040 --> 02:46:06,120
Where did the feet thing come from?

3356
02:46:07,660 --> 02:46:08,740
No, it's so funny.

3357
02:46:08,820 --> 02:46:33,520
I was looking at Little Witch Nobita stuff earlier and there was this one phone stand with her feet out so much but I was like I I her her toes looked like fingers it was like feet!

3358
02:46:33,840 --> 02:46:36,220
It made me feel I didn't really like it.

3359
02:46:36,320 --> 02:46:40,360
I was like oh my gosh, I feel like I can smell this picture but not in a good way.

3360
02:46:45,340 --> 02:46:48,100
Nobita has some interesting merch twitter posts.

3361
02:46:48,220 --> 02:46:48,780
Yes they do.

3362
02:46:49,500 --> 02:46:50,300
If you...

3363
02:46:52,200 --> 02:46:56,600
I'm not gonna put up the picture because something about it makes me uncomfortable.

3364
02:46:56,860 --> 02:46:57,820
I don't know what it is.

3365
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:02,300
Don't feet shame.

3366
02:47:02,420 --> 02:47:02,720
I'm not!

3367
02:47:02,920 --> 02:47:03,300
I'm not!

3368
02:47:03,440 --> 02:47:04,460
I'm not feet shaming.

3369
02:47:04,620 --> 02:47:05,220
I get it.

3370
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:06,640
Like I get it if you're into feet.

3371
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:07,100
I get it.

3372
02:47:08,480 --> 02:47:09,880
But it's just not my thing.

3373
02:47:10,620 --> 02:47:11,680
It's just not my thing.

3374
02:47:11,980 --> 02:47:13,640
It really looks like monkey toes.

3375
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:14,760
That's what I'm saying!

3376
02:47:18,780 --> 02:47:21,340
Would you be interested in joining my new cafe?

3377
02:47:21,620 --> 02:47:23,740
It's called Super Cute Awesome Maids!

3378
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:26,940
AKA Cafe Scam!

3379
02:47:27,480 --> 02:47:28,040
Wow!

3380
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:30,700
Oh my gosh and you're all about them.

3381
02:47:30,780 --> 02:47:32,920
I can tell you're like a scam kamioshi.

3382
02:47:33,060 --> 02:47:33,880
You're just scam.

3383
02:47:34,340 --> 02:47:34,900
Wow!

3384
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:37,700
Super Cute Awesome Maids?

3385
02:47:40,760 --> 02:47:41,200
Hmmm...

3386
02:47:43,440 --> 02:47:43,880
Hmmm...

3387
02:47:43,880 --> 02:47:44,120
Hmmm...

3388
02:47:44,120 --> 02:47:44,720
I like it.

3389
02:47:46,400 --> 02:47:47,400
I like it.

3390
02:47:52,280 --> 02:47:53,160
Cafe Scam.

3391
02:47:53,180 --> 02:47:54,120
S-C-A-M.

3392
02:47:54,460 --> 02:47:54,900
Sorry.

3393
02:47:55,080 --> 02:47:55,700
Is it not scam?

3394
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:56,600
Is it S-C-A-M?

3395
02:47:56,800 --> 02:47:57,220
Sorry.

3396
02:48:00,540 --> 02:48:01,540
Respect the hustle.

3397
02:48:02,560 --> 02:48:03,740
It sounds so legit.

3398
02:48:05,080 --> 02:48:07,180
I mean I'm already in a maid cafe right now.

3399
02:48:07,220 --> 02:48:07,680
As you can see.

3400
02:48:07,700 --> 02:48:09,400
But I will consider.

3401
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:17,480
Will there be a competitor called F-R-A-U-D?

3402
02:48:18,460 --> 02:48:19,100
Hmmm...

3403
02:48:20,060 --> 02:48:21,340
Yeah, I mean...

3404
02:48:21,340 --> 02:48:23,140
We can't have a monopoly here, right?

3405
02:48:24,340 --> 02:48:26,040
There could be S-H-A-M.

3406
02:48:28,420 --> 02:48:29,440
Cafe Sham.

3407
02:48:32,620 --> 02:48:33,260
Anyway...

3408
02:48:33,260 --> 02:48:34,820
Eating Mike Tyson's ass?

3409
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:35,580
Yubi yubi!

3410
02:48:35,580 --> 02:48:36,040
Thank you!

3411
02:48:37,020 --> 02:48:38,040
Minty Fresh Kyle!

3412
02:48:38,420 --> 02:48:39,040
Thank you!

3413
02:48:40,040 --> 02:48:42,120
Mint, if you hate us, don't say anything.

3414
02:48:44,500 --> 02:48:45,260
Oh, wait.

3415
02:48:45,660 --> 02:48:46,160
Something.

3416
02:48:46,600 --> 02:48:46,920
Oh, wait.

3417
02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:48,100
Anything.

3418
02:48:49,020 --> 02:48:49,520
Wait.

3419
02:48:50,560 --> 02:48:51,720
If you don't...

3420
02:48:51,720 --> 02:48:53,360
Wait, if you hate us...

3421
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:56,620
Don't say anything.

3422
02:48:58,840 --> 02:49:00,340
Oh, I mixed it up.

3423
02:49:03,900 --> 02:49:05,120
I thought you meant...

3424
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:07,180
I thought you meant, if you like us...

3425
02:49:07,180 --> 02:49:08,560
Say anything.

3426
02:49:08,840 --> 02:49:09,000
Wait.

3427
02:49:09,080 --> 02:49:10,960
If you hate us, say...

3428
02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:11,900
Wait.

3429
02:49:13,080 --> 02:49:13,640
Huh?

3430
02:49:16,340 --> 02:49:18,880
I thought, if you don't hate us...

3431
02:49:18,880 --> 02:49:19,880
Say anything.

3432
02:49:24,340 --> 02:49:25,700
Quit your crying!

3433
02:49:26,060 --> 02:49:27,240
Quit your crying!

3434
02:49:27,800 --> 02:49:29,020
I don't wanna see...

3435
02:49:30,140 --> 02:49:32,340
I don't wanna see any more of these tears!

3436
02:49:32,340 --> 02:49:33,960
Quit your crying!

3437
02:49:34,260 --> 02:49:35,240
Quit your crying!

3438
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:46,700
Quit your crying!

3439
02:49:46,980 --> 02:49:48,220
Quit your crying.

3440
02:49:48,480 --> 02:49:48,620
Yeah?

3441
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:53,520
What about it?

3442
02:49:56,760 --> 02:49:58,160
Quit your crying.

3443
02:49:59,320 --> 02:50:00,740
Quit your crying.

3444
02:50:02,100 --> 02:50:03,560
This is the real world.

3445
02:50:03,740 --> 02:50:07,580
This is what you will hear on a daily basis.

3446
02:50:07,840 --> 02:50:08,220
This is what you will hear on a daily basis.

3447
02:50:08,220 --> 02:50:11,060
Someone will walk up to you on the street and they'll say, Hey, I hate you.

3448
02:50:11,860 --> 02:50:13,960
That's just the reality of things.

3449
02:50:14,300 --> 02:50:15,580
You gotta be tough.

3450
02:50:15,860 --> 02:50:18,780
You gotta be a tough cookie out there.

3451
02:50:25,500 --> 02:50:26,420
It's true.

3452
02:50:26,600 --> 02:50:26,880
It's true.

3453
02:50:30,990 --> 02:50:32,130
That's messed up.

3454
02:50:32,490 --> 02:50:32,730
That's messed up.

3455
02:50:34,870 --> 02:50:36,330
That's just how life is, man.

3456
02:50:39,450 --> 02:50:42,970
Here to gauge your interest in my venture, the freaking rad...

3457
02:50:47,190 --> 02:50:49,010
Awesome, ultra delicious cafe.

3458
02:50:50,450 --> 02:50:52,310
F-R-A-U-D for short.

3459
02:50:54,050 --> 02:50:54,530
Competition.

3460
02:50:54,970 --> 02:50:55,670
Oh my gosh.

3461
02:50:55,670 --> 02:50:56,850
I'm getting too many offers, you guys.

3462
02:50:57,010 --> 02:50:57,490
Please.

3463
02:50:57,550 --> 02:50:57,910
Please.

3464
02:50:58,270 --> 02:50:59,650
Please respect my boundaries.

3465
02:51:00,690 --> 02:51:01,970
Send it to my email.

3466
02:51:03,130 --> 02:51:04,370
Send it to my manager.

3467
02:51:04,590 --> 02:51:05,170
A.K.A.

3468
02:51:05,170 --> 02:51:05,510
me.

3469
02:51:06,770 --> 02:51:08,070
Why do you make us cry?

3470
02:51:08,450 --> 02:51:10,170
Stop telling me what to do, VTuber.

3471
02:51:14,260 --> 02:51:14,700
Fine.

3472
02:51:16,100 --> 02:51:17,360
I won't tell you twice.

3473
02:51:18,940 --> 02:51:19,860
Pre-order bonus.

3474
02:51:19,960 --> 02:51:21,380
Thank you for the 10.

3475
02:51:21,460 --> 02:51:22,380
Thank you so much.

3476
02:51:24,740 --> 02:51:25,820
Mint, get a manager.

3477
02:51:26,020 --> 02:51:27,520
Okay, but you make it sound so easy.

3478
02:51:28,980 --> 02:51:30,360
You make it sound so easy.

3479
02:51:32,580 --> 02:51:33,020
You make it sound so easy.

3480
02:51:33,740 --> 02:51:34,180
You make it sound so easy.

3481
02:51:34,200 --> 02:51:34,400
Like...

3482
02:51:35,420 --> 02:51:37,920
How does one just acquire a manager?

3483
02:51:38,220 --> 02:51:39,580
I have to find someone...

3484
02:51:39,580 --> 02:51:40,820
First of all, I don't know anybody.

3485
02:51:41,060 --> 02:51:43,600
Second of all, I have to find someone...

3486
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:44,260
That...

3487
02:51:44,900 --> 02:51:47,640
That's not gonna steal all my information and run away.

3488
02:51:47,860 --> 02:51:49,480
Like a Looney Tunes villain.

3489
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:49,880
Okay?

3490
02:51:52,680 --> 02:51:54,180
The afterlife is hard.

3491
02:51:54,720 --> 02:51:55,240
Okay?

3492
02:51:59,900 --> 02:52:01,140
Ask Mr. Man.

3493
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:03,520
Just call Mr. Man.

3494
02:52:03,800 --> 02:52:07,380
Just call Mr. Man.

3495
02:52:07,380 --> 02:52:09,500
The manager's store.

3496
02:52:09,840 --> 02:52:11,420
I'm gonna go to a vending machine.

3497
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:13,440
Manager vending machine.

3498
02:52:15,160 --> 02:52:16,140
MintyFreshKyle, thank you!

3499
02:52:16,700 --> 02:52:17,720
Paperbacks, thank you!

3500
02:52:18,500 --> 02:52:19,580
GatoRaffen, thank you!

3501
02:52:26,970 --> 02:52:29,910
I feel disturbance in the floors.

3502
02:52:31,150 --> 02:52:32,170
MintyFreshKyle, thank you!

3503
02:52:32,490 --> 02:52:33,590
MintyFreshKyle, thank you again!

3504
02:52:37,330 --> 02:52:39,770
YouTubeGPTChatBot version 1.51 Thank you!

3505
02:52:44,050 --> 02:52:47,090
Koro-san is the greatest Vtuber of all time.

3506
02:52:47,230 --> 02:52:48,990
All glory to the dog god.

3507
02:52:53,870 --> 02:52:55,050
Chatbots are out of hand.

3508
02:52:56,250 --> 02:52:58,050
YouTubeGPTChatBot version 1.51?

3509
02:52:58,270 --> 02:53:00,090
I wonder what he'll say in version 1.52.

3510
02:53:02,750 --> 02:53:04,110
Dog I am.

3511
02:53:04,710 --> 02:53:07,050
Wait, are you a chatbot or are you a dog?

3512
02:53:07,570 --> 02:53:09,890
Who gave this dog a keyboard?

3513
02:53:09,890 --> 02:53:10,970
Who gave this dog a keyboard?

3514
02:53:11,990 --> 02:53:13,070
Thank you, thank you!

3515
02:53:15,330 --> 02:53:16,370
Thank you, thank you!

3516
02:53:16,370 --> 02:53:18,650
May I interest you in super chill amazing managers?

3517
02:53:18,910 --> 02:53:19,010
May I interest you in super chill amazing managers?

3518
02:53:19,010 --> 02:53:19,690
God, I wish.

3519
02:53:21,750 --> 02:53:23,170
Finally managed to catch a stream!

3520
02:53:23,590 --> 02:53:26,370
A lot of streams overlap with work unfortunately compared to years ago.

3521
02:53:26,530 --> 02:53:27,050
Oh no!

3522
02:53:27,570 --> 02:53:31,610
But thank you for dropping by when you can.

3523
02:53:34,310 --> 02:53:38,610
This mint girl seems like a cute, happy, awesome, really awesome, totally awesome nerd.

3524
02:53:39,050 --> 02:53:39,450
Charlotte!

3525
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:54,040
That's quite the praise.

3526
02:53:55,160 --> 02:53:57,280
On the internet, nobody knows you are a dog.

3527
02:53:58,680 --> 02:54:00,160
Eating Mike Tyson's butt.

3528
02:54:00,260 --> 02:54:00,880
Thank you!

3529
02:54:01,060 --> 02:54:02,460
Hi mint, I'm excited to watch that.

3530
02:54:02,560 --> 02:54:03,680
I hope your day is going well.

3531
02:54:08,240 --> 02:54:09,020
Actually it's so funny.

3532
02:54:09,020 --> 02:54:15,440
A friend of mine was just like, what's up with that eating Mike Tyson's butt guy?

3533
02:54:15,640 --> 02:54:18,700
Why does everyone always say legend, legend every time he comes up?

3534
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:24,840
And so I actually, I showed them the clip of Korone saying your name.

3535
02:54:24,980 --> 02:54:26,200
And her just going, no!

3536
02:54:31,900 --> 02:54:34,000
So I watched it again recently.

3537
02:54:37,500 --> 02:54:37,980
So I watched it again recently.

3538
02:54:38,360 --> 02:54:39,000
So I watched it again recently.

3539
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:40,200
So yeah.

3540
02:54:40,680 --> 02:54:41,940
Fancy seeing you!

3541
02:54:42,080 --> 02:54:43,120
Fancy seeing you!

3542
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:46,000
Thanks for dropping by so often.

3543
02:54:47,620 --> 02:54:48,860
Evan's kazoo covers.

3544
02:54:49,060 --> 02:54:49,640
Thank you!

3545
02:54:49,980 --> 02:54:51,260
Is this Halo 2?

3546
02:54:54,040 --> 02:54:56,680
Not enough chief.

3547
02:54:59,260 --> 02:55:00,120
Second soul.

3548
02:55:00,240 --> 02:55:00,580
Thank you!

3549
02:55:05,240 --> 02:55:07,500
Did you play Death Must Die?

3550
02:55:07,620 --> 02:55:08,480
Matara liked it a lot.

3551
02:55:10,580 --> 02:55:11,540
Also thank you!

3552
02:55:12,640 --> 02:55:16,220
I'm listening while halfway through a 6-7 mile walk and regretting it.

3553
02:55:16,440 --> 02:55:18,380
Regretting the stream or regretting the walk?

3554
02:55:22,680 --> 02:55:23,640
Which one?

3555
02:55:28,440 --> 02:55:30,400
Which one are you regretting?

3556
02:55:33,940 --> 02:55:35,860
Hey mint, you seem super into Metal Gear.

3557
02:55:36,100 --> 02:55:38,220
We all know the real reason to play MGS though.

3558
02:55:38,320 --> 02:55:38,900
For shipping!

3559
02:55:38,900 --> 02:55:38,980
For shipping!

3560
02:55:39,720 --> 02:55:42,600
Who's your favorite pair and who's your favorite rare pair?

3561
02:55:43,700 --> 02:55:46,360
Favorite pair is Big Boss and Ocelot.

3562
02:55:47,300 --> 02:55:48,260
Rare pair.

3563
02:55:50,980 --> 02:55:52,020
Rare pair.

3564
02:55:54,960 --> 02:55:55,980
Rare pair.

3565
02:55:57,220 --> 02:55:58,280
Rare pair.

3566
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:02,780
Rare pair.

3567
02:56:04,200 --> 02:56:04,920
Rare

3568
02:56:08,400 --> 02:56:08,740
pair.

3569
02:56:09,740 --> 02:56:10,740
Dirty pair.

3570
02:56:13,700 --> 02:56:14,940
Rare pair?

3571
02:56:18,780 --> 02:56:20,120
Rare pair?

3572
02:56:21,800 --> 02:56:23,180
Rare pair.

3573
02:56:24,460 --> 02:56:25,460
Rare pair.

3574
02:56:27,480 --> 02:56:28,760
Rare pair?

3575
02:56:32,320 --> 02:56:34,160
Rare pair...?

3576
02:56:34,160 --> 02:56:36,160
Miller-Naomi.

3577
02:56:36,560 --> 02:56:36,920
Miller-Naomi?

3578
02:56:36,960 --> 02:56:41,060
They don't even know each other.

3579
02:56:41,240 --> 02:56:41,460
They don't even know each other.

3580
02:56:44,580 --> 02:56:46,260
Rare pair...

3581
02:56:46,260 --> 02:56:46,980
Oh!

3582
02:56:47,600 --> 02:56:49,580
Obviously Vamp and Naomi.

3583
02:56:56,280 --> 02:56:58,580
Vamp and Naomi.

3584
02:56:59,020 --> 02:57:00,340
Great couple.

3585
02:57:00,660 --> 02:57:02,620
My favorite rare pair.

3586
02:57:04,680 --> 02:57:05,680
Eww.

3587
02:57:09,320 --> 02:57:10,320
Yuck.

3588
02:57:12,480 --> 02:57:14,140
I almost choked on my drink.

3589
02:57:16,620 --> 02:57:18,060
Vamp and Riot and Naomi.

3590
02:57:19,380 --> 02:57:20,680
What are you talking about?

3591
02:57:22,180 --> 02:57:24,120
It's the best rare pair.

3592
02:57:26,220 --> 02:57:27,200
Rico, thank you!

3593
02:57:27,660 --> 02:57:29,340
I'm glad you're enjoying your Helldivers training.

3594
02:57:29,620 --> 02:57:33,600
Actually, Mataro is trying to organize a Helldivers collab.

3595
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:36,740
Because I've been wanting to play it.

3596
02:57:37,240 --> 02:57:38,220
So yeah, good training.

3597
02:57:38,500 --> 02:57:40,360
I know that it will be so useful.

3598
02:57:41,240 --> 02:57:42,460
Oh, actually I should play it.

3599
02:57:42,480 --> 02:57:45,000
I should play MGS5 again.

3600
02:57:46,860 --> 02:57:48,420
For actual training.

3601
02:57:49,120 --> 02:57:51,240
Hey MF, it's Piccolo again.

3602
02:57:51,440 --> 02:57:52,520
Dirty pair of what?

3603
02:57:53,480 --> 02:57:54,300
Of socks.

3604
02:57:55,340 --> 02:57:56,520
Dirty pair of socks.

3605
02:57:56,720 --> 02:57:57,440
Wash your socks everybody.

3606
02:57:58,120 --> 02:57:59,260
Thank you!

3607
02:57:59,460 --> 02:58:00,660
Thank you again!

3608
02:58:01,320 --> 02:58:04,100
Thank you!

3609
02:58:04,100 --> 02:58:06,580
This game really makes you feel like Touhou.

3610
02:58:08,300 --> 02:58:09,820
Oh, I felt the Touhou.

3611
02:58:11,320 --> 02:58:12,120
Thank you!

3612
02:58:13,980 --> 02:58:15,180
Thank you!

3613
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:18,800
Thank you!

3614
02:58:18,880 --> 02:58:19,620
Thank you!

3615
02:58:20,060 --> 02:58:20,480
Thank you!

3616
02:58:21,180 --> 02:58:28,820
Thank you, I think.

3617
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:30,180
Thank you!

3618
02:58:30,460 --> 02:58:31,920
Thank you!

3619
02:58:32,140 --> 02:58:33,040
Thank you!

3620
02:58:35,200 --> 02:58:37,460
Eleven seems to be my lucky number.

3621
02:58:42,080 --> 02:58:44,180
That was one of the achievements I got.

3622
02:58:59,940 --> 02:59:04,220
I just realized the time.

3623
02:59:04,380 --> 02:59:06,000
You guys, I gotta put it together on my desk.

3624
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,780
I mean, my furniture.

3625
02:59:10,660 --> 02:59:12,560
So let's say I'm happy to see you back again.

3626
02:59:12,640 --> 02:59:13,380
I've loved every stream.

3627
02:59:13,520 --> 02:59:15,920
I don't talk much in chat, but every stream has been so much fun.

3628
02:59:16,120 --> 02:59:17,500
Aww, thank you.

3629
02:59:18,380 --> 02:59:19,660
Happy to be back.

3630
02:59:21,100 --> 02:59:23,400
I have a lot of fun every day, so thank you guys.

3631
02:59:25,880 --> 02:59:26,280
Lenguinihududu.

3632
02:59:26,320 --> 02:59:27,620
That's such an awesome name.

3633
02:59:29,640 --> 02:59:31,200
Sucks you have to be the second one though.

3634
02:59:35,230 --> 02:59:36,430
Shelf building stream.

3635
02:59:38,390 --> 02:59:39,590
Dogs drinks, thank you.

3636
02:59:39,650 --> 02:59:40,930
Jolly Ram Rancher, thank you.

3637
02:59:41,590 --> 02:59:42,610
Inane, thank you.

3638
02:59:44,350 --> 02:59:45,430
LeahD, thank you.

3639
02:59:45,990 --> 02:59:46,930
X21, thank you.

3640
02:59:48,150 --> 02:59:48,590
95...

3641
02:59:49,750 --> 02:59:50,190
Intract?

3642
02:59:50,670 --> 02:59:51,690
Did I say that right?

3643
02:59:51,850 --> 02:59:52,350
Thank you.

3644
02:59:54,330 --> 02:59:55,350
Slimekin, thank you.

3645
02:59:56,170 --> 02:59:57,390
Galactic Core, thank you.

3646
02:59:57,670 --> 02:59:58,570
Reynard, thank you.

3647
02:59:58,710 --> 02:59:59,390
Rhea, thank you.

3648
02:59:59,670 --> 03:00:01,090
Nushi Sushi, thank you.

3649
03:00:01,330 --> 03:00:02,150
Ice Dream, thank you.

3650
03:00:02,390 --> 03:00:03,470
Gato Reffen, thank you.

3651
03:00:03,830 --> 03:00:05,170
Gato Reffen, thank you again.

3652
03:00:06,430 --> 03:00:07,350
LeahD, thank you.

3653
03:00:07,350 --> 03:00:08,230
VeroLint, thank you.

3654
03:00:08,950 --> 03:00:09,670
FarTheKiller, thank you.

3655
03:00:10,070 --> 03:00:10,690
StarCreator, thank you.

3656
03:00:11,530 --> 03:00:12,310
LimoLimo, thank you.

3657
03:00:14,070 --> 03:00:14,390
Genos.

3658
03:00:16,770 --> 03:00:17,490
HelloConnoisseur, thank you.

3659
03:00:17,810 --> 03:00:19,250
Sorry, I was making sure I said your...

3660
03:00:19,250 --> 03:00:20,470
Did I say your name right?

3661
03:00:20,510 --> 03:00:20,830
I hope so.

3662
03:00:22,690 --> 03:00:25,510
If you don't hate us, don't say...

3663
03:00:26,830 --> 03:00:27,150
Wait.

3664
03:00:27,450 --> 03:00:28,910
If you don't hate us...

3665
03:00:28,910 --> 03:00:29,530
Wait, oh no!

3666
03:00:40,340 --> 03:00:40,900
FlashMessage.

3667
03:00:42,580 --> 03:00:43,460
You're welcome.

3668
03:00:45,960 --> 03:00:50,060
Speaking of figures, I recently got my Miku 15th Anniversary Shortcake figure.

3669
03:00:50,320 --> 03:00:51,260
It's so cute.

3670
03:00:51,600 --> 03:00:53,360
Wait, I don't know if I've seen that one before.

3671
03:00:54,780 --> 03:00:55,340
Google.

3672
03:00:57,960 --> 03:01:00,020
Oh my god, it's beautiful!

3673
03:01:00,020 --> 03:01:02,840
Oh my gosh, it's beautiful!

3674
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:07,240
It's so pretty.

3675
03:01:07,440 --> 03:01:09,320
Oh my god, the base is a plate.

3676
03:01:10,900 --> 03:01:12,040
It's so pretty.

3677
03:01:13,520 --> 03:01:14,980
What scale is she?

3678
03:01:15,140 --> 03:01:17,320
Oh my god, the price on it.

3679
03:01:17,420 --> 03:01:18,380
Wait, the price!

3680
03:01:18,780 --> 03:01:20,020
What scale is she?

3681
03:01:21,740 --> 03:01:22,840
1 seventh.

3682
03:01:26,500 --> 03:01:27,100
Sheesh.

3683
03:01:29,200 --> 03:01:30,440
She is so cute.

3684
03:01:30,620 --> 03:01:34,300
Oh my gosh, the macaron too is so... everything is so cute.

3685
03:01:37,400 --> 03:01:37,880
Yeah,

3686
03:01:41,420 --> 03:01:42,320
you guys, I said it.

3687
03:01:42,340 --> 03:01:43,700
It means I don't hate you guys.

3688
03:01:43,760 --> 03:01:44,500
Stop crying.

3689
03:01:47,640 --> 03:01:48,600
Stop crying.

3690
03:01:48,820 --> 03:01:55,340
I should un-private the... I don't think I had the flash message on my...

3691
03:01:55,340 --> 03:01:56,940
You know, I had a tongue twister video.

3692
03:01:57,240 --> 03:01:58,540
I should un-private it.

3693
03:01:58,740 --> 03:02:02,540
It's kind of cringe hearing me from so long ago.

3694
03:02:05,060 --> 03:02:06,300
She hates us.

3695
03:02:09,980 --> 03:02:11,580
Love seeing different games.

3696
03:02:11,620 --> 03:02:13,500
Hope you keep having a lot of fun with them.

3697
03:02:13,620 --> 03:02:16,140
Replay Tokyo Jungle after you mention it.

3698
03:02:17,180 --> 03:02:19,260
I should play Tokyo Jungle, shouldn't I?

3699
03:02:19,880 --> 03:02:20,940
I should, I should.

3700
03:02:21,320 --> 03:02:22,660
I can play whatever I want.

3701
03:02:22,940 --> 03:02:24,340
That's the craziest thing.

3702
03:02:25,340 --> 03:02:29,500
If there's something I want to play, the day it comes out, I can play it.

3703
03:02:31,140 --> 03:02:32,540
I can play whatever I want.

3704
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:34,120
Whatever.

3705
03:02:35,640 --> 03:02:36,760
Actually, that's a lie.

3706
03:02:37,180 --> 03:02:40,080
There are some things that I will stay away from.

3707
03:02:40,380 --> 03:02:43,100
That I kind of want to play, but I won't.

3708
03:02:43,800 --> 03:02:45,880
Because I'm scared of Nintendo.

3709
03:02:48,940 --> 03:02:52,880
Like if it's like a Pokemon mod, I won't.

3710
03:02:52,880 --> 03:02:54,180
I probably won't play it.

3711
03:02:55,340 --> 03:02:58,520
I've seen that a lot of channels have been getting struck.

3712
03:03:02,420 --> 03:03:06,360
I've heard other VTubers complaining that there's actually too little MGS fanfiction.

3713
03:03:06,680 --> 03:03:07,540
Is this true?

3714
03:03:07,940 --> 03:03:09,220
I don't read fanfiction.

3715
03:03:09,540 --> 03:03:13,700
But I have talked about this with a friend where we were like...

3716
03:03:13,700 --> 03:03:15,040
We were like...

3717
03:03:15,800 --> 03:03:19,880
When the Master Collection comes out, maybe all the girlies will be like, Yes!

3718
03:03:20,340 --> 03:03:21,280
This is it!

3719
03:03:21,340 --> 03:03:22,120
This is the game!

3720
03:03:22,280 --> 03:03:23,180
This is the series!

3721
03:03:23,180 --> 03:03:25,360
And there will be so much more doujin.

3722
03:03:25,680 --> 03:03:27,780
But, unfortunately...

3723
03:03:27,780 --> 03:03:28,860
It hasn't...

3724
03:03:28,860 --> 03:03:32,480
At least from what I've noticed, it hasn't changed much.

3725
03:03:33,420 --> 03:03:33,940
So...

3726
03:03:35,340 --> 03:03:37,160
Like I went to Comiket last year.

3727
03:03:37,600 --> 03:03:39,040
I went to Winter Comiket.

3728
03:03:40,720 --> 03:03:44,880
And there was only a few tables with MGS doujin.

3729
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:46,520
And they were all...

3730
03:03:46,520 --> 03:03:48,400
They were all like, from 5.

3731
03:03:48,580 --> 03:03:50,120
So it was a little disappointing.

3732
03:03:51,740 --> 03:03:52,480
So sad.

3733
03:03:52,480 --> 03:03:53,420
So sad.

3734
03:03:53,500 --> 03:03:53,820
So sad.

3735
03:03:59,210 --> 03:04:00,370
Thank you!

3736
03:04:01,170 --> 03:04:03,390
Thank you for all the gifted dono...

3737
03:04:03,390 --> 03:04:04,510
Gifted memberships!

03:04:04,510 --> 03:04:05,530
I really appreciate it!

3739
03:04:05,950 --> 03:04:07,010
Thank you!

3740
03:04:07,770 --> 03:04:08,890
Thank you!

3741
03:04:10,590 --> 03:04:11,170
Thank you!

3742
03:04:11,330 --> 03:04:11,730
Thank you!

3743
03:04:13,110 --> 03:04:14,330
Greetings from Germany!

3744
03:04:15,010 --> 03:04:16,050
What time is it?

3745
03:04:16,210 --> 03:04:16,750

Guten...

3747
03:04:18,690 --> 03:04:19,570
Guten Tag.

3748
03:04:20,010 --> 03:04:20,850
I don't know.

3749
03:04:20,890 --> 03:04:21,490
Wait, it's...

3750
03:04:21,900 --> 03:04:22,910
It's really late there.

3751
03:04:25,090 --> 03:04:26,410
What time in Germany?

3752
03:04:30,640 --> 03:04:31,900
1AM in Germany.

3753
03:04:34,580 --> 03:04:35,720
Guten Nacht.

3754
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:37,140
Guten Nacht!

3755
03:04:42,040 --> 03:04:42,720
Yes.

3756
03:04:44,060 --> 03:04:45,220
Auf... Auf...

3757
03:04:45,220 --> 03:04:47,820
Oh gosh, don't let her hear me say this.

3758
03:04:49,180 --> 03:04:49,860
Aufs...

3759
03:04:49,860 --> 03:04:50,880
Aufs...

3760
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:51,260
Aufs...

3761
03:04:53,740 --> 03:04:54,860
Don't let her hear me say it.

3762
03:04:55,140 --> 03:04:55,820
Auf...

3763
03:05:04,240 --> 03:05:06,940
Don't... Don't let her hear me say it.

3764
03:05:08,280 --> 03:05:10,060
She's gonna come for me, you guys.

3765
03:05:13,580 --> 03:05:14,980
She's gonna come for me.

3766
03:05:16,060 --> 03:05:17,140
Auf wieder...

3767
03:05:18,060 --> 03:05:19,060
Auf... Hold on.

3768
03:05:19,140 --> 03:05:20,000
Someone put it...

3769
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:21,820
Auf... Auf...

3770
03:05:22,740 --> 03:05:23,280
Auf...

3771
03:05:23,280 --> 03:05:24,160
Where did it go?

3772
03:05:24,920 --> 03:05:26,880
Auf... Auf...

3773
03:05:26,880 --> 03:05:28,060
Wait, where did it go?

3774
03:05:29,860 --> 03:05:30,660
Auf...

3775
03:05:31,280 --> 03:05:33,200
Someone broke it apart.

3776
03:05:33,400 --> 03:05:33,840
Where did it go?

3777
03:05:34,040 --> 03:05:35,340
Auf... Flash?

3778
03:05:37,880 --> 03:05:39,400
Stop, stop, stop.

3779
03:05:39,580 --> 03:05:41,200
Auf... Auf...

3780
03:05:41,200 --> 03:05:42,180
Auf...

3781
03:05:43,520 --> 03:05:44,320
Auf...

3782
03:05:44,320 --> 03:05:45,080
Auf...

3783
03:05:47,140 --> 03:05:48,340
Auf wiedersehen.

3784
03:05:48,880 --> 03:05:51,120
Auf wiedersehen.

3785
03:06:02,320 --> 03:06:02,880
Auf....

3786
03:06:02,880 --> 03:06:03,160
Auf...

3787
03:06:03,160 --> 03:06:03,900
Anyway...

3788
03:06:05,940 --> 03:06:07,580
Yeah, this means you should go to bed.

3789
03:06:08,520 --> 03:06:09,400
Galactic 그러니까요.

3790
03:06:09,400 --> 03:06:09,660
Thank you.

3791
03:06:11,040 --> 03:06:13,560
Hi, Minty.

3792
03:06:13,680 --> 03:06:15,260
No time, no super chat.

3793
03:06:15,460 --> 03:06:16,520
You look gorgeous as ever.

3794
03:06:16,820 --> 03:06:17,380
Auf...

3795
03:06:19,400 --> 03:06:20,340
Thank you.

3796
03:06:21,180 --> 03:06:22,120
Thank you.

3797
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,120
a lot of thanks.

3798
03:06:26,540 --> 03:06:27,100
Refresh.

3799
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:31,820
Also, Pirate606, thank you!

3800
03:06:31,980 --> 03:06:34,300
I read your dono, but I didn't thank you.

3801
03:06:34,420 --> 03:06:34,980
Thank you so much.

3802
03:06:35,140 --> 03:06:37,300
Auf Wiedersehen!

3803
03:06:37,660 --> 03:06:38,140
No!

3804
03:06:39,480 --> 03:06:42,800
No, no, no, no, no!

3805
03:06:46,340 --> 03:06:48,000
Your German is cute, greeting.

3806
03:06:48,380 --> 03:06:50,100
Greetings from another German wisp.

3807
03:06:52,240 --> 03:06:54,320
Is that why I can't say your name right?

3808
03:06:58,980 --> 03:07:00,160
I mean, see you later.

3809
03:07:00,280 --> 03:07:01,800
Yeah, I'm telling you to go to sleep!

3810
03:07:03,420 --> 03:07:04,740
I'm telling you to go to sleep!

3811
03:07:05,460 --> 03:07:07,000
Oh wait, where did I leave off on?

3812
03:07:08,820 --> 03:07:10,260
Oh, oh, oh, here we go.

3813
03:07:12,940 --> 03:07:13,620
Rodrigo, thank you!

3814
03:07:13,920 --> 03:07:17,360
What a great way to spend my cozy Sunday, relaxing with mint and Coronet.

3815
03:07:17,500 --> 03:07:18,520
Thanks for another fun stream.

3816
03:07:18,640 --> 03:07:18,920
Thank you!

3817
03:07:21,880 --> 03:07:23,440
Resting Glitch Face, thank you!

3818
03:07:24,060 --> 03:07:25,740
Think I may have stolen some of your luck.

3819
03:07:25,920 --> 03:07:30,360
Was playing a similar game, Kill the Crows, and got six unlocks in ten minutes.

3820
03:07:30,580 --> 03:07:31,880
Gomen na sai.

3821
03:07:32,360 --> 03:07:33,000
That's okay.

3822
03:07:33,320 --> 03:07:34,260
I forgive you.

3823
03:07:40,900 --> 03:07:42,700
Actually, I don't forgive you.

3824
03:07:45,020 --> 03:07:46,380
I don't forgive you.

3825
03:07:48,140 --> 03:07:49,480
I'm going to haunt you.

3826
03:07:51,280 --> 03:07:54,120
I'm going to haunt you until you give me my luck back.

3827
03:08:19,630 --> 03:08:20,450
That was weird.

3828
03:08:21,990 --> 03:08:22,850
What was happening?

3829
03:08:22,850 --> 03:08:25,150
Oh, Customer Johnson, thank you!

3830
03:08:25,770 --> 03:08:26,530
Wow, it's Doug.

3831
03:08:26,630 --> 03:08:27,070
Hi, Doug!

3832
03:08:28,010 --> 03:08:28,690
Just scam.

3833
03:08:28,850 --> 03:08:29,330
Thank you!

3834
03:08:30,050 --> 03:08:30,830
You got it.

3835
03:08:30,830 --> 03:08:31,310
You got it.

3836
03:08:31,310 --> 03:08:32,990
You got some competition up in here.

3837
03:08:33,170 --> 03:08:33,730
I'm just saying.

3838
03:08:35,030 --> 03:08:37,110
But there's, you know...

3839
03:08:37,590 --> 03:08:38,430
Potware, thank you!

3840
03:08:38,710 --> 03:08:39,410
Ego Jojo.

3841
03:08:40,310 --> 03:08:41,350
Pocky Donut, thank you!

3842
03:08:41,990 --> 03:08:43,070
Maggish, thank you!

3843
03:08:43,690 --> 03:08:45,110
You can hate me any day.

3844
03:08:45,170 --> 03:08:45,530
Stop.

3845
03:08:46,790 --> 03:08:48,490
Hollow, my baby, thank you!

3846
03:08:49,450 --> 03:08:51,070
Teacup and Nyan Nyan, thank you!

3847
03:08:51,230 --> 03:08:52,170
No, stop crying.

3848
03:08:53,070 --> 03:08:54,250
Nexi Dava, thank you!

3849
03:08:55,550 --> 03:08:57,110
Niels Wouter, thank you!

3850
03:08:58,130 --> 03:08:59,130
Cheggie, thank you!

3851
03:09:00,090 --> 03:09:01,190
Sionios, thank you!

3852
03:09:02,610 --> 03:09:03,750
Just Scam, thank you!

3853
03:09:04,290 --> 03:09:05,550
Karma Strikes, thank you!

3854
03:09:05,810 --> 03:09:07,290
Rico, thank you!

3855
03:09:10,010 --> 03:09:11,290
Katrina Dungle, thank you!

3856
03:09:11,670 --> 03:09:13,430
It's a Bow Wow world out there.

3857
03:09:14,010 --> 03:09:14,890
So true.

3858
03:09:16,090 --> 03:09:17,110
Zazzamos, thank you!

3859
03:09:19,870 --> 03:09:21,890
Hot Dog, where do I sign up for a haunting?

3860
03:09:21,890 --> 03:09:24,350
You know, that's the fun part about it.

3861
03:09:24,390 --> 03:09:26,490
Just by being here, you sign up.

3862
03:09:27,650 --> 03:09:30,090
Sometimes, I might come and possess you a little bit.

3863
03:09:30,630 --> 03:09:31,350
A little.

3864
03:09:33,990 --> 03:09:38,810
When you least expect a possession, it will arrive.

3865
03:09:39,750 --> 03:09:41,390
Piccolo, thank you!

3866
03:09:42,470 --> 03:09:44,710
Hakunon Matata, thank you!

3867
03:09:44,990 --> 03:09:47,550
Or Hakunon... Hakunon Matata?

3868
03:09:47,930 --> 03:09:49,390
I guess that makes more sense, right?

3869
03:09:51,070 --> 03:09:54,470
David Titanium Peepy Dog, thank you!

3870
03:09:54,790 --> 03:09:55,790
Gliss, thank you!

3871
03:09:55,950 --> 03:09:56,990
Super G, thank you!

3872
03:09:57,470 --> 03:10:01,510
Is Johnny and Bathroom a rare pair since he hardly makes it?

3873
03:10:03,030 --> 03:10:05,790
Actually, I do like Johnny and Meryl.

3874
03:10:05,890 --> 03:10:07,210
So maybe that's like a...

3875
03:10:07,210 --> 03:10:08,270
It's like a...

3876
03:10:08,270 --> 03:10:09,510
It's like a...

3877
03:10:09,510 --> 03:10:09,850
No!

3878
03:10:10,430 --> 03:10:11,630
Oh my gosh, you guys.

3879
03:10:11,810 --> 03:10:12,830
My favorite...

3880
03:10:12,830 --> 03:10:16,710
My favorite rare pair is Raiden and Rose.

3881
03:10:18,210 --> 03:10:18,810
How?

3882
03:10:18,810 --> 03:10:20,610
How could I forget them?

3883
03:10:20,730 --> 03:10:22,850
The most powerful couple in the world.

3884
03:10:23,590 --> 03:10:26,910
They are my favorite toxic couple ever.

3885
03:10:27,530 --> 03:10:28,650
Oh my gosh.

3886
03:10:28,890 --> 03:10:31,750
I live for Raiden and Rose drama.

3887
03:10:32,250 --> 03:10:34,110
I love it so much.

3888
03:10:34,570 --> 03:10:36,090
It's so fun!

3889
03:10:37,570 --> 03:10:39,450
They're such a great...

3890
03:10:41,550 --> 03:10:43,990
It's my favorite telenovela ever.

3891
03:10:46,490 --> 03:10:47,970
Sketch, welcome to membership.

3892
03:10:47,970 --> 03:10:48,550
Thank you!

3893
03:10:50,010 --> 03:10:50,970
Egotistical woman.

3894
03:10:52,210 --> 03:10:53,870
Does that count as a rare pair?

3895
03:10:54,230 --> 03:10:56,850
Maybe because I don't think many people ship them.

3896
03:10:58,810 --> 03:11:00,730
I don't think many people ship them.

3897
03:11:01,590 --> 03:11:02,830
What did I enter to?

3898
03:11:02,990 --> 03:11:04,170
I'm just reading donuts.

3899
03:11:06,090 --> 03:11:07,250
Weeaboo, let's thank you!

3900
03:11:07,570 --> 03:11:08,450
Fukuro-chan, thank you!

3901
03:11:09,190 --> 03:11:10,270
Karateka, thank you!

3902
03:11:13,470 --> 03:11:16,250
Please don't possess or hunt me while I'm on the toilet.

3903
03:11:16,410 --> 03:11:17,290
That would be embarrassing.

3904
03:11:17,290 --> 03:11:18,110
For me.

3905
03:11:18,250 --> 03:11:18,970
Thank you.

3906
03:11:21,450 --> 03:11:23,430
I don't want to do that.

3907
03:11:23,790 --> 03:11:25,070
So I think you're safe.

3908
03:11:25,290 --> 03:11:26,730
Red Ranger, welcome to membership.

3909
03:11:26,770 --> 03:11:27,390
Thank you!

3910
03:11:27,850 --> 03:11:28,950
Oh no, I'm possessed.

3911
03:11:29,230 --> 03:11:31,750
Oh no, my ten dollars turning into figurine funds.

3912
03:11:32,010 --> 03:11:32,530
No!

3913
03:11:35,150 --> 03:11:36,070
Oh my gosh.

3914
03:11:36,170 --> 03:11:36,510
No!

3915
03:11:39,870 --> 03:11:40,910
Stop it!

3916
03:11:42,030 --> 03:11:43,370
Don't do it!

3917
03:11:49,410 --> 03:11:50,390
Where was I?

3918
03:11:51,710 --> 03:11:53,070
Lilia, Seraphina, thank you!

3919
03:11:53,410 --> 03:11:55,350
I have no idea how much joy you bring me.

3920
03:11:55,450 --> 03:11:58,310
And everyone's seeing you laugh, smile, and just being yourself every time you stream.

3921
03:11:58,490 --> 03:11:59,190
Thank you.

3922
03:12:00,910 --> 03:12:01,750
Thank you!

3923
03:12:02,990 --> 03:12:04,190
So nice of you.

3924
03:12:04,370 --> 03:12:04,950
Thank you.

3925
03:12:07,210 --> 03:12:08,610
Fleur Deli is gaming.

3926
03:12:10,410 --> 03:12:11,870
Definitely think I said that wrong.

3927
03:12:12,070 --> 03:12:12,890
But thank you so much.

3928
03:12:13,270 --> 03:12:13,690
I'll...

3929
03:12:14,140 --> 03:12:14,590
No, no.

3930
03:12:14,650 --> 03:12:16,330
Not the schnitzel.

3931
03:12:18,170 --> 03:12:19,170
Eintracht, thank you!

3932
03:12:20,350 --> 03:12:21,070
Go to sleep.

3933
03:12:22,030 --> 03:12:23,090
Niels Water, thank you!

3934
03:12:24,670 --> 03:12:26,330
How can we sleep when our commie...

3935
03:12:26,330 --> 03:12:26,990
Oh, she is streaming.

3936
03:12:27,170 --> 03:12:27,350
No!

3937
03:12:29,130 --> 03:12:30,430
I will try and do...

3938
03:12:30,430 --> 03:12:31,850
Try and do...

3939
03:12:33,450 --> 03:12:35,090
EU friendly time this week.

3940
03:12:35,270 --> 03:12:36,270
The salt word gun goes...

3941
03:12:36,270 --> 03:12:36,490
Yes!

3942
03:12:36,510 --> 03:12:36,850
Ouch!

3943
03:12:37,570 --> 03:12:37,970
Stop!

3944
03:12:38,690 --> 03:12:39,090
Stop!

3945
03:12:39,150 --> 03:12:39,490
Stop!

3946
03:12:39,490 --> 03:12:39,690
Stop!

3947
03:12:41,950 --> 03:12:43,170
Why would you send that?

3948
03:12:43,550 --> 03:12:43,930
Ouch!

3949
03:12:43,930 --> 03:12:44,150
Ouch!

3950
03:12:44,410 --> 03:12:44,810
Ouch!

3951
03:12:44,950 --> 03:12:45,350
Ouch!

3952
03:12:45,350 --> 03:12:45,470
Ouch!

3953
03:12:45,550 --> 03:12:45,650
Ouch!

3954
03:12:45,850 --> 03:12:45,990
Ouch!

3955
03:12:46,630 --> 03:12:47,030
Ouch!

3956
03:12:47,210 --> 03:12:47,270
Ouch!

3957
03:12:47,290 --> 03:12:48,250
Why would you do that?

3958
03:12:51,150 --> 03:12:52,670
I think I should go to sleep.

3959
03:12:52,810 --> 03:12:53,190
Oh, sorry.

3960
03:12:53,270 --> 03:12:53,890
I didn't mean to yell.

3961
03:12:54,950 --> 03:12:55,430
Um...

3962
03:12:56,750 --> 03:12:57,970
Ninja Tim, thank you!

3963
03:12:58,090 --> 03:12:59,530
Greetings from Austria, too.

3964
03:13:01,230 --> 03:13:02,130
Guten nacht!

3965
03:13:04,450 --> 03:13:04,930
Um...

3966
03:13:04,930 --> 03:13:06,290
Linguini Houdini.

3967
03:13:06,550 --> 03:13:08,150
Made inugami phantom.

3968
03:13:08,470 --> 03:13:08,930
Nope.

3969
03:13:11,310 --> 03:13:11,790
Why?

3970
03:13:13,890 --> 03:13:14,750
Thank you.

3971
03:13:14,850 --> 03:13:15,750
Nicole, thank you!

3972
03:13:16,670 --> 03:13:17,270
Rodrigo, thank you!

3973
03:13:18,130 --> 03:13:19,490
Rico, hot dog!

3974
03:13:20,670 --> 03:13:21,570
Kaito, thank you!

3975
03:13:22,430 --> 03:13:24,750
Nicole, I don't know why I get this feeling...

3976
03:13:24,750 --> 03:13:25,170
But like...

3977
03:13:25,170 --> 03:13:25,850
Are you my girlfriend?

3978
03:13:28,970 --> 03:13:29,770
Did I...

3979
03:13:31,170 --> 03:13:32,050
Possess someone...

3980
03:13:32,050 --> 03:13:32,750
Um...

3981
03:13:33,610 --> 03:13:34,870
And ask you out?

3982
03:13:36,570 --> 03:13:37,310
I don't know.

3983
03:13:37,910 --> 03:13:38,350
Stop!

3984
03:13:38,490 --> 03:13:39,690
Stop sending me salt!

3985
03:13:40,590 --> 03:13:41,250
Stop it!

3986
03:13:41,270 --> 03:13:41,610
Stop it!

3987
03:13:41,630 --> 03:13:41,870
I am not...

3988
03:13:41,870 --> 03:13:43,870
That's why I'm not salty at all because...

3989
03:13:43,870 --> 03:13:45,090
I am not salty at all...

3990
03:13:45,090 --> 03:13:46,670
Because it will literally kill me, you guys.

3991
03:13:46,830 --> 03:13:47,270
You guys.

3992
03:13:50,720 --> 03:13:53,060
I think someone I possessed asked you out, Nicole.

3993
03:13:53,260 --> 03:13:54,580
I don't know why I feel like that.

3994
03:13:55,580 --> 03:13:56,380
But anyway...

3995
03:14:00,120 --> 03:14:02,240
Oh my gosh,

3996
03:14:15,500 --> 03:14:15,940
the salt!

3997
03:14:19,200 --> 03:14:20,300
Customer Johnson, thank you!

3998
03:14:20,340 --> 03:14:21,480
Wrestling Glitchface, thank you!

3999
03:14:22,320 --> 03:14:22,720
Osos!

4000
03:14:24,320 --> 03:14:24,720
Wiresun!

4001
03:14:25,540 --> 03:14:25,940
Paperbacks!

4002
03:14:26,580 --> 03:14:27,300
Pocky Donut!

4003
03:14:28,200 --> 03:14:28,600
Kenja!

4004
03:14:29,640 --> 03:14:30,440
Baby Paladin!

4005
03:14:31,080 --> 03:14:31,980
Thank you, thank you!

4006
03:14:32,940 --> 03:14:34,320
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4007
03:14:35,860 --> 03:14:37,020
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4008
03:14:37,860 --> 03:14:38,500
Amelia Zhang!

4009
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:40,940
Yeah, like a snail!

4010
03:14:41,720 --> 03:14:42,420
Wild and Stuck!

4011
03:14:43,260 --> 03:14:44,000
Wrong for Rabbit!

4012
03:14:46,420 --> 03:14:48,300
Have you noticed a change in behavior?

4013
03:14:48,440 --> 03:14:49,100
Do Metal Gear and...

4014
03:14:49,120 --> 03:14:51,560
Idle Goods arrive that you don't remember ordering?

4015
03:14:51,760 --> 03:14:54,100
You may have been possessed by Maid Mint Phantom!

4016
03:14:54,500 --> 03:14:55,100
Don't complain!

4017
03:14:55,300 --> 03:14:56,140
You're a lucky person!

4018
03:14:57,900 --> 03:14:58,800
TalkTalk, thank you!

4019
03:15:02,240 --> 03:15:04,000
You guys are literally killing me.

4020
03:15:05,100 --> 03:15:05,860
Fake Knee!

4021
03:15:06,380 --> 03:15:07,340
Yuki Baskerville!

4022
03:15:08,320 --> 03:15:09,300
What about Pepper?

4023
03:15:09,540 --> 03:15:10,400
No, that's okay.

4024
03:15:10,580 --> 03:15:11,460
Thanks, DingusCon!

4025
03:15:12,260 --> 03:15:13,360
Take up NyanNyan!

4026
03:15:13,900 --> 03:15:14,660
The Nain!

4027
03:15:15,280 --> 03:15:16,000
Right back!

4028
03:15:17,520 --> 03:15:19,100
Why are you guys doing this to me?

4029
03:15:19,100 --> 03:15:20,900
I'm turning off Donut right now.

4030
03:15:21,900 --> 03:15:22,340
Turn.

4031
03:15:22,520 --> 03:15:22,840
Off.

4032
03:15:23,040 --> 03:15:24,980
I understand the implications of this action.

4033
03:15:25,340 --> 03:15:25,780
Turn.

4034
03:15:26,120 --> 03:15:26,560
Off.

4035
03:15:27,660 --> 03:15:28,100
Perfect.

4036
03:15:28,440 --> 03:15:29,280
Okay, now I refresh.

4037
03:15:32,660 --> 03:15:33,100
Refresh.

4038
03:15:36,580 --> 03:15:37,600
Ash and Sloth.

4039
03:15:38,680 --> 03:15:39,940
Sketch the Cartoon Guy!

4040
03:15:40,320 --> 03:15:41,880
The podcast is a hoot!

4041
03:15:41,960 --> 03:15:45,960
If you're still thinking of haunting a grocery store on the side, let me tell you, working retail is hell.

4042
03:15:46,440 --> 03:15:47,100
I know.

4043
03:15:47,460 --> 03:15:48,520
I have done it.

4044
03:15:51,560 --> 03:15:52,600
I have done it.

4045
03:15:52,780 --> 03:15:52,880
I have done it.

4046
03:15:53,660 --> 03:15:54,100
I have done it.

4047
03:15:54,100 --> 03:15:54,120
I have done it.

4048
03:15:54,120 --> 03:15:54,460
Um...

4049
03:15:55,700 --> 03:15:56,880
I don't know quite yet.

4050
03:15:59,780 --> 03:16:06,620
Part of me is just like, things are stressful, and I just wanna go back to having a normal job, so I don't have to think about it.

4051
03:16:07,780 --> 03:16:08,220
But...

4052
03:16:08,740 --> 03:16:09,320
You know.

4053
03:16:11,120 --> 03:16:11,560
Oh...

4054
03:16:12,660 --> 03:16:13,540
Literally 1984.

4055
03:16:14,600 --> 03:16:15,480
Totally salted.

4056
03:16:15,800 --> 03:16:16,900
She hates us.

4057
03:16:17,120 --> 03:16:18,400
Stop your crying.

4058
03:16:18,400 --> 03:16:18,500
Just...

4059
03:16:18,500 --> 03:16:18,940
Stop crying!

4060
03:16:18,940 --> 03:16:20,140
Stop your crying!

4061
03:16:29,420 --> 03:16:32,760
Does it work with kosher or fortified salt?

4062
03:16:32,940 --> 03:16:33,920
I think it's just any salt.

4063
03:16:34,100 --> 03:16:35,400
What is a fortified salt?

4064
03:16:38,760 --> 03:16:39,460
Anyway...

4065
03:16:40,340 --> 03:16:42,520
Murphy game over!

4066
03:16:43,460 --> 03:16:44,640
That's it everybody!

4067
03:16:44,900 --> 03:16:45,600
Go home!

4068
03:16:45,800 --> 03:16:46,380
Go home!

4069
03:16:48,560 --> 03:16:50,020
Spank, thanks for the 20 gifted!

4070
03:16:51,340 --> 03:16:52,540
Nebula, thank you for the gifted!

4071
03:16:52,820 --> 03:16:53,980
I'm gonna go... oh my gosh.

4072
03:16:54,060 --> 03:16:55,360
I suddenly got super hungry.

4073
03:16:55,560 --> 03:16:56,800
So I'm gonna go eat.

4074
03:16:58,480 --> 03:16:59,680
I'm gonna go have dinner.

4075
03:16:59,820 --> 03:17:02,480
And I suggest the same for you guys.

4076
03:17:02,700 --> 03:17:04,760
Also, I see you in the Streamlabs.

4077
03:17:04,800 --> 03:17:06,480
Gaea and Chiron-cha.

4078
03:17:06,740 --> 03:17:08,180
I see you both.

4079
03:17:08,700 --> 03:17:09,800
I see you.

4080
03:17:09,900 --> 03:17:11,760
I see you, I see you, I see you.

4081
03:17:16,960 --> 03:17:17,580
Otsuminto!

4082
03:17:18,180 --> 03:17:18,800
Everybody!

4083
03:17:18,940 --> 03:17:20,920
I'm just gonna leave because I'm...

4084
03:17:21,560 --> 03:17:23,220
starting to get shaky hungry.

4085
03:17:25,260 --> 03:17:26,160
I'm hungry!

4086
03:17:26,520 --> 03:17:27,260
I'm hungry!

4087
03:17:29,200 --> 03:17:30,300
Let's have...

4088
03:17:30,300 --> 03:17:31,180
a good meal.

4089
03:17:32,340 --> 03:17:32,960
Otsuminto!

4090
03:17:33,960 --> 03:17:34,580
Otsuminto!

4091
03:17:34,740 --> 03:17:35,160
Otsuminto!

4092
03:17:35,280 --> 03:17:35,600
Otsuminto!

4093
03:17:36,760 --> 03:17:37,660
Bye bye!

4094
03:17:37,860 --> 03:17:38,880
Thank you guys!

4095
03:17:39,020 --> 03:17:40,140
Thank you for another fun stream!

4096
03:17:41,760 --> 03:17:43,580
Not tomorrow because tomorrow is...

4097
03:17:43,580 --> 03:17:44,940
Well, I will see you on the podcast.

4098
03:17:45,220 --> 03:17:47,000
If you listen, please listen.

4099
03:17:47,540 --> 03:17:47,940
Yes.

4100
03:17:49,040 --> 03:17:49,640
Bye bye!

4101
03:17:49,940 --> 03:17:50,500
Bye bye!

4102
03:17:50,560 --> 03:17:50,920
Bye bye!

4103
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:51,780
Thank you guys!

4104
03:17:51,900 --> 03:17:53,020
Thank you so much as always!

4105
03:17:55,800 --> 03:17:56,200
Bye!
