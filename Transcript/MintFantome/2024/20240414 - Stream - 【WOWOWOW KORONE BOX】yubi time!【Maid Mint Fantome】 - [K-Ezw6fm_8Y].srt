1
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,680
It went so fast.

2
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,240
Bye.

3
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,620
Oh,

4
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,300
I don't know why so many people thought this was a collab.

5
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,400
I don't know why so many people thought this was a collab.

6
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,720
Sorry to disappoint you.

7
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,140
I'm only playing a game.

8
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,080
Because people can't read.

9
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,800
Maybe.

10
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,240
Wow, real Korone on screen.

11
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,360
Oh, Korone-san, what do you have to say?

12
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,120
Welcome to my stream.

13
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,040
Oh.

14
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,960
Uh, she says...

15
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,400
She says...

16
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,640
Wow.

17
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,740
She says, wow, wow.

18
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,840
Just like the game.

19
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,100
Wow, wow, wow.

20
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,860
Wow, wow, wow.

21
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,920
Such true words.

22
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,220
Yeah, she said that, for real.

23
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,020
Yeah.

24
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,260
I'm excited to play.

25
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:17,980
Look at this.

26
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,860
This is so cute.

27
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,440
Yubi!

28
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,140
Yubi!

29
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,100
Oh, one Yubi.

30
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,100
Yubi, Yubi!

31
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,200
Two Yubi.

32
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,220
Yubi, Yubi, Yubi.

33
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,260
Yubi, Yubi, Yubi.

34
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,320
Machine gun.

35
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,000
Shot the gun.

38
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,040
Bunk, bunk.

39
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,940
Bunk, bunk, bunk, hammer.

40
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,220
Wait, she says other things too.

41
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,800
And there's also other weapons to unlock.

42
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,400
I don't know why it looks like a sensor.

43
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,020
Bone?

44
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,800
Okay.

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,440
Okayu?

46
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,080
Cat?

47
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,580
I don't know.

48
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,600

49
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,840

00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

53
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,580
Shot gun.

54
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:01,960
Yeah.

55
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,800
So we're gonna, we're just gonna hang out and play for a
little bit.

56
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,780
Today's stream won't be super long because I have some stuff
that I need to get done.

57
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,640
I got a new thing to build.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
A shelf.

59
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,600
I bought a shelf that I have to build.

60
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,540
And just some other things.

61
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,480
Ikea moment.

62
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,160
Yeah, basically.

63
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,860
Lemo, lemo!

64
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Thank you for the tiny gift.

65
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,880
Thank you!

66
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,080
But I just wanted to still chill and hang out.

67
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:49,440
little bit today yeah and I thought this would be perfect so
we have a couple I've never played this before it was just

68
00:05:49,440 --> 00:06:01,900
officially released like a couple days ago so I do want to
play holo cure cuz I really like I really like a vampire

69
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,200
survivor and stuff so

70
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,120
Um...

71
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,100
Mint, don't read.

72
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,090
But yeah, um, probably will try a holocure at some point
too.

73
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,990
We'll just do normal mode.

74
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,050
Let's go!

75
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,310
I'm a dog!

76
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,230
Oh, how do I move?

77
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:26,470
Oh.

78
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,610
Ah!

79
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,670
Is that a thing I've destroyed?

80
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,470
Actually, I'm not sure.

81
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,110
Wait, this way?

82
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,590
Oh, what's this?

83
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:33,890
Yumi!

84
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:34,650
Yumi!

85
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:35,290
Oh!

86
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,990
Ah!

87
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,130
Wait, what is this thing?

88
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,770
What is this thing?

89
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:45,310
Oh.

90
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,910
I'm dog.

91
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,570
Oh, there's a...

92
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:51,970
Oh, no!

93
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:53,810
Ah!

94
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,090
Oh, I like the shotgun, actually.

95
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,250
Oh, my gosh.

96
00:06:59,130 --> 00:06:59,330
Oh!

97
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,450
Ah!

98
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,050
Ah!

99
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,370
Ah!

100
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,090
The Danmaku.

101
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,550
It's okay.

102
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,450
I've played Toho.

103
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,230
times.

104
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,390
Oh no.

105
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,290
This is already so fun.

106
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,310
Right click?

107
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,510
Wait, what's the difference?

108
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,550
Maybe normal mode is too easy.

109
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,920
I said that.

110
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,660
That I don't know.

111
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,300
Oh my god, the achievement is I've died.

112
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,000
Thank you forever.

113
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,820
My score is two?

114
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,540
That's it.

115
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,320
Let's go, amigo.

116
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,780
Let's go.

117
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,380
Let's go.

118
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,420
Oh, I have to get these.

119
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,120
Yubi, Yubi.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,660
So do come.

121
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,440
Check the gut.

122
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,680
Oh, the guys come out of there.

123
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,060
I understand now.

124
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

125
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,880
He's gonna explode.

126
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,360
Yubi!

127
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,600
Oh, I almost walked right into that guy.

128
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

129
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,020
Oh, this way.

130
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,660
It's okay.

131
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,300
Again, I play Toho.

132
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,260
Oh, Bunk!

133
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,500
Wow!

134
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,420
Ha!

135
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,620
This one feels like you gotta get kind of close on them,
though, right?

136
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:37,940
Ooh.

137
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Pro Mint Gaming, obviously.

138
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:43,800
This way.

139
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,480
Shut the gun!

140
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,380
Shut the gun!

141
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,940
The bonk is kind of dangerous.

142
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,660
Yeah, because you have to get real close

143
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:09,200
Collect five coronet boxes Okay, hold on I don't want to
like go through stuff so fast, but I also want to see the

144
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,860
other stages and stuff right Mr. Albeze, thanks for the 10
gift.

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,740
Thank you.

146
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:24,160
It's one hit KO One hit KO This one looks cute too.

147
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,780
That's crap.

148
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,460
Let's go sunshine, amigo!

149
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,180
Sunshine!

150
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,380
No!

151
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

152
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,940
Get out of my way.

153
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,260
Get out of my way.

154
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,780
Yubi, Yubi!

155
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,780
Yubi, everybody!

156
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,160
Oh my god, I'm stuck.

157
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,760
Bunk, bunk!

158
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,860
Not the bunk.

159
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,860
Also the bunk, you can't just endlessly shoot.

160
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,720
Sunshine Amigos!

161
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,260
This way?

162
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,380
Oh my god, thank you forever.

163
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,660
What?

164
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,160
I used the bonk, you guys all saw.

165
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,660
Let's go Sunshine Amigos!

166
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,420
Sunshine Amigos!

167
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,900
You beat Revolver!

168
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,140
My favorite.

169
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,640
Oh, wait.

170
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,220
Wait, I want to use it a little bit.

171
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,780
Where's the, where's the bat?

172
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,380
It bounces!

173
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,040
Wait, six shots.

174
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,410
I don't want to change it.

175
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,380
This king is scary.

176
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,700
Shotgun.

177
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:40,960
Retry.

178
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,780
Retry, retry, retry.

179
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,760
Retry, retry.

180
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,240
Yes.

181
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,320
Yes.

182
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,580
Also, you can't go in the water.

183
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,000
Shotgun.

184
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,600
Shotgun.

185
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,430
There we go.

186
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,670
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

187
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,530
Back off!

188
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,190
Back off!

189
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,110

00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,530
How's everybody doing?

This weekend.

193
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,410
Oh my gosh.

194
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:28,750
Oh my gosh.

195
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,210
Oh my gosh.

196
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,810
No bonk.

197
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,230
Yubi yubi yubi.

198
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,050
Pretty good.

199
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,090
Wow!

200
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,610
Oh my god.

201
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,570
The revolver is powerful, you guys!

202
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,590
Right, I think the revolver is kind of the best.

203
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,770
No, no bonk!

204
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:53,890
No bonk!

205
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,950
Yubi Yubi!

206
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,790
Six shots.

207
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,770
Grocery shopping.

208
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,010
That's always important to do on the weekends, right?

209
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,090
X potato.

210
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,430
Oh!

211
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:29,970
I unlocked the X- Another working Sunday.

212
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,150
Happy to listen.

213
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,350
Oh, good luck!

214
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,010
Maybe this is...

215
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,650
This is like a harder game to listen to.

216
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,070
It's kind of noisy, right?

217
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,070
Let's go, amigo!

218
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,210
Let's go!

219
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,350
I like the stage though.

220
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,150
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, this way.

221
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,670
Machine gun!

222
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,850
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

223
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,730
It's shaky.

224
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:58,530
Oh!

225
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,830
What's the difference between right click and left click?

226
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,510
Yubi, yubi!

227
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:10,900
Yubi!

228
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,330
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

229
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:15,590
Ow!

230
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:16,430
Whoa!

231
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa, and then the button.

232
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,190
One is right, the other is not.

233
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,530
You're so right.

234
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,190
I don't want to get rid of my UB revolver.

235
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,530
I know the shotgun is so powerful, but like...

236
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,870
The revolver is so awesome.

237
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,270
Nice, Sue.

238
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,330
We'll see you go.

239
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:44,610
You!

240
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,730
Yubi Yubi!

241
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,510
Yubi?

242
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:50,690
Yubi.

243
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:51,690
Everybody.

244
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,250
Oh yeah!

245
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,870
Just shoot everywhere, miss everything.

246
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,170
You die.

247
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,380
Thank you, Koiba.

248
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,660
Okay, let's try the next stage.

249
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,940
The orange box.

250
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,000
Yubi Yubi.

251
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,860
Just don't get hit.

252
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,500
Give up your Yubis for sacrifice.

253
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,500
You can't even see my UBs!

254
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,900
They're hidden!

255
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,740
They're hidden, my UBs.

256
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,740
Let's go sunshine, amigo!

257
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,100
Wait, this map is kind of... black.

258
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,820
Wait, I don't want to get the box before I...

259
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,320
Oh!

260
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:52,960
Whoa!

261
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:53,680
UB!

262
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,380
UB!

263
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,820
Seems kind of a waste to...

264
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,300
To get rid of it.

265
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,700
Did she just scream?

266
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,780
Oh my god, no, I don't like the road!

267
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,560
Take my Yubi.

268
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,520
Wait, who else is shooting?

269
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,880
Oh, those are me.

270
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,740
Bonk, bonk.

271
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,720
Oh no, no, no bonk, no bonk.

272
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,840
It's bonk too difficult, bonk too difficult!

273
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,610
Oh, this way, it is this way.

274
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,690
Run away, run away, run away!

275
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,270
Run away, run away!

276
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,490
This way.

277
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,550
Okay, this stage is so tricky!

278
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,390
Okay, nice.

279
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,930
I was- I'm doing

280
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,120
it!

281
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,380
Nice.

282
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,750
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

283
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,050
Oh my god, it's pushing me!

284
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,350
pushing me away.

285
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,210
Where's shotgun?

286
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,510
This way.

287
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,830
This way.

288
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,380
This way.

289
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,300
This way, this way.

290
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,780
I think we're good- hit this way.

291
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,880
How do I get there?

292
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,540
Shoe, shoe, shoe, shoe, shoe.

293
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,860
Oh, yeah, yeah.

294
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,000
Ow!

295
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,200
I swear.

296
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,460
No!

297
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,060
No bonk, no bonk.

298
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,080
Where is she?

299
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,400
Oh my god.

300
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,480
Oh my god, no.

301
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,280
You have to get so close!

302
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,060
Please!

303
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:29,960
Ow!

304
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,290
I think I have to go this way.

305
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,050
Meow!

306
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,010
Oh, here we go.

307
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,630
Oh!

308
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:40,770
Joshi!

309
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,470
Oh my god.

310
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,670
Oh no no no no no!

311
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:46,730
Confidence!

312
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,570
There's even bosses!

313
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,090
Oh my gosh.

314
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,370
Level!

315
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,230
Thanks for the 20 gift.

316
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:51,930
Thank you so much!

317
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,630
Thank you!

318
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,470
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

319
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,110
You can parry bullets.

320
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,470
You can!

321
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,410
No confidence.

322
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,250
Have confidence.

323
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,200
It's crazy because I did the best on this round.

324
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,620
Even though the stage was so crazy.

325
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,640
so crazy.

326
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,200
Oh, my contact is...

327
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,960
Let's go sunshine, amigos!

328
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,860
If only I had gotten the X potato cannon again.

329
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,640
Oh, uh...

330
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,240
Maybe it's kind of hard to use, too.

331
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,280
Nice!

332
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,500
Nice!

333
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:36,940
Oh!

334
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,100
I'm... I think I am cheating the system.

335
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,980
What do I have right now?

336
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,390
Blubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbub.

337
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,250
Oh, down here.

338
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,250
There

339
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,020
we go.

340
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,640
Oh my gosh, that was so close.

341
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,120
AHAA!

342
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:13,940
AHAA!

343
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,820
I think I got...

344
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,720
Yeah, I'm stuck.

345
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,880
I'm just gonna keep shooting.

346
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,260
Ow!

347
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,560
There we go.

348
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,820
Oh, here it is.

349
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,080
Here it is.

350
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,800
Yubi, Yubi!

351
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,980
Yubi, Yubi!

352
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,290
Am I hitting anything or am I hitting at nothing?

353
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,550
I'm hitting everything at nothing at the same time.

354
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:47,870
Juba!

355
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,310
Juba!

356
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,190
Go!

357
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,070
Don't go with it!

358
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,250
When she laughs, it's so funny.

359
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,310
This guy's back.

360
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,730
We're at the box.

361
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,830
It's a good question.

362
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:08,490
He came from nowhere.

363
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,230
Spray and pray.

364
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,210
Spray and pray.

365
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,870
No, he came from nowhere.

366
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,770
No!

367
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:17,670
Okay.

368
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,390
Let's go sunshine, amigo!

369
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,030
Sunshine!

370
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:31,770
much more um energy when she says when she says amigos
actually i think i prefer shooting in like oh this way

371
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:38,670
shooting in like the one direction then both use using the
finger guns like this

372
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:59,160
uh here we go bunk bunk wait i want to test it oh you can
You can shoot the bullets back.

373
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,600
That's not...

374
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Oh my god, the roaches are so fast.

375
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,500
Oops.

376
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,560
But you do have to be pretty close.

377
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:14,220
And it's also only... it's directional, so it's a little
tricky in that regard.

378
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:16,660
Yep!

379
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,440
Oh, that was so close.

380
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,780
That was so close.

381
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,310
Ice!

382
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,210
I hear them coming out.

383
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,190
Goodbye, little roach.

384
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,330
Oh my gosh!

385
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,330
X potato cannon is OP!

386
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,710
I don't want to get rid of it!

387
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,610
It's so awesome!

388
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,860
Ah, this side.

389
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

390
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,850
Where is she?

391
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,490
Nice.

392
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,160
I think I killed some...

393
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,510
Everybody!

394
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,390
Wait.

395
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:22,810
Oh my gosh.

396
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,960
I'm sorry!

397
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,060
I'm sorry!

398
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:32,560
I'm sorry!

399
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,900
She literally took a...

400
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,060
Took a...

401
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,460
Took a...

402
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:39,740
Took a...

403
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,020
She literally took a...

404
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,820
A cannon to the face.

405
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

406
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,540
Launched into orbit.

407
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:50,860
Ah!

408
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,900
Well, fuck!

409
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,840
Well, fuck, fuck.

410
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,380
Does it work for these?

411
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,280
Oh, it does.

412
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,420
But it's...

413
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,000
They're slow.

414
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,580
It's tricky.

415
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,460
Okay, oh, I need to go this way?

416
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,140
Where is it?

417
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,270
The three Husketeers?

418
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:13,970
Wait, where are they?

419
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,730
Oh, oh, oh.

420
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,250
Oh my gosh.

421
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:22,650
Oh my god.

422
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,150
Oh, yeah.

423
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:23,910
No!

424
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,740
I got knocked by dog.

425
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,460
I got it.

426
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:34,940
I got it.

427
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,080
A listener sign needs to chill.

428
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:37,760
For real.

429
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:39,940
For real.

430
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,640
Chainsaw.

431
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,760
I'm glad you're enjoying your hell divers training.

432
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,360
I didn't even get to shoot the...

433
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,520
I didn't even get to see the boss at all.

434
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,480
Welcome, amigo.

435
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,260
Let's go.

436
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,400
This one, this stage is tricky, but I think I like it.

437
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,880
Nice job.

438
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,400
I like the challenge, you know?

439
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

440
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,820
Oh, fuck.

441
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,460
Cute bastard.

442
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,520
Thank you for the 50.

443
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,600
Oh, my gosh.

444
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,180
Thank you so much.

445
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,060
Wait, hold on.

446
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,840
What's going on?

447
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,100
Oh.

448
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,810
Making sure I don't have a phone call.

449
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,730
Oh, no, we're good.

450
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,650
Okay, my phone was, like, going crazy for some reason.

451
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,630
I was like, you're streaming!

452
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,410
You're supposed to be streaming!

453
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:31,940
Dang!

454
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,080
Is it on camera?

455
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,140
If you can use it correctly, it's pretty good, actually.

456
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,640
It's actually pretty good.

457
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,240
So, do I got that

458
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:49,950
one.

459
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,450
Did it count?

460
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,490
I don't like the roach.

461
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,510
Uh...

462
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,990
I'm a dog!

463
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,570
Also, please don't send me super chats about my taxes.

464
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,190
Thank you.

465
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,070
I think that's...

466
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,090
Oh!

467
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:15,470
Oh...

468
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,190
Okay.

469
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,090
She said I have confidence, you guys.

470
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:19,850
We got this.

471
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,790
Next, potato!

472
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,370
Now I'm very confident with my...

473
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:24,770
weapon.

474
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:27,990
Oh, no!

475
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,850
That was really bad.

476
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,370
At least there's no...

477
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,250
At least there's no backsplash.

478
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,410
No confidence, you guys.

479
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,230
No confidence.

480
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,170
It's the...

481
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,110
It's the rouches.

482
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:47,310
Not.

483
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,870
Oh, gosh.

484
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,470
Oh, gosh.

485
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,130
Let's get her.

486
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,910
Let's get her now.

487
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,410
Maybe we got her.

488
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,290
I don't know.

489
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,170
Maybe we got her.

490
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,070
There we go.

491
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,350
Okay.

492
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,510
This way.

493
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,140
How am I making so many?!

494
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,140
Okay, let's choose...

495
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,060
Let's go back to this one.

496
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,640
I like the pepper box.

497
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,340
Hard mode.

498
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,560
Let's go sunshine, amigo!

499
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,240
Sunshine!

500
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,380
How hard can it be?

501
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,220
How hard can it be, you guys?

502
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,980
I haven't been able to do a single boss, but how hard can it
be?

503
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,420
Bunk!

504
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,420
Bunk, bunk!

505
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,520
Machine guy!

506
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,200
The thing

507
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,160
about this game makes me want to like...

508
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,600
Oh my gosh.

509
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,840
It makes me want to like conserve bullets even though I know
that's not a thing.

510
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,640
You know what I mean?

511
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,960
Oh, oh, we got him!

512
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,060
Oh, she's back!

513
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,380
Where is it?

514
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh, this way.

515
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,320
Oh my gosh, wait.

516
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,700
I think hard mode is kind of in...

517
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,360
It's like...

518
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,520
It's actual Toho now.

519
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,360
Oh, wait.

520
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,000
Oh, my God.

521
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,240
It's actual Toho now.

522
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,000
Ah!

523
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,660
No!

524
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,020
Oh, my God.

525
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,000
Live!

526
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:52,900
Oh, my God.

527
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,800
The machine gun sucks.

528
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,420
It pushes you into all the...

529
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,020
Into everything.

530
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,260
It pushes you into everything.

531
00:27:59,460 --> 00:27:59,780
No!

532
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,060
Leave, leave, leave, leave.

533
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,060
Go away.

534
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,060
Go away.

535
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,380
Go, listen.

536
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,440
Oh, no.

537
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,820
Ow, no, no!

538
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,700
Ow, yo, yo!

539
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,380
Ow!

540
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,000
Ah!

541
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,220
I got my same scores before.

542
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,920
This is Toho.

543
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,480
Ah!

544
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,550
My one contact is so...

545
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,490
Make my eyes so dry!

546
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,790
Okay, there we go.

547
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,210
Okay.

548
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,010
I think we're good.

549
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:35,790
We try.

550
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:36,510
Oh!

551
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,230
We get to try the chainsaw.

552
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,380
I don't think the chainsaw is the weapon for me, everybody.

553
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,960
I don't think the chainsaw...

554
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,720
I'm dying, thank you for...

555
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,680
Or maybe any

556
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,440
weapon...

557
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,100
Maybe I'm... skill issue...

558
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,640
Skill issue, something, something.

559
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:17,400
Fuck!

560
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,600
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

561
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,920
Get good, something, something...

562
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,580
Wait, am I on hard mode?

563
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:42,770
again or am i actually i don't remember did it no no
chainsaw no i don't like chainsaw oh oh the what's it called

564
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:50,630
for that is the splash damage is good but the reload time is
not good

565
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,930
skillish I

566
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,140
got no confidence game over without collecting a single
Corone box.

567
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,640
Let's go.

568
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,400
He spawn camped me.

569
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,560
Real.

570
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,840
He spawned camped me in real.

571
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,160
Where'd that dog go?

572
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,800
I don't like the chainsaw.

573
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,020
I don't like the chainsaw.

574
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,480
Get me out of here.

575
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,420
Bunk, bunk, bunk, bunk.

576
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,460
No bunk either!

577
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,000
Roach!

578
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,720
Invasion!

579
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,200
Mint is back, I'm so happy!

580
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,980
Thanks for the super chat!

581
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,060
Thank you!

582
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:21,990
Get

583
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,100
away from me, roach!

584
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,500
Get away from me, roach!

585
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,710
And everything!

586
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:38,650
And nothing!

587
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,190
We

588
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,750
beat my last score now.

589
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,690
Josie!

590
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:54,490
Josie!

591
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,010
Oh, ow!

592
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,030
Those guys were just coming up on me so fast.

593
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,430
I can't even see the bosses.

594
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,450
Wait, did I...

595
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,070
I am playing it on hard mode.

596
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,950
Okay, normal mode.

597
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:18,690
Normal mode.

598
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,390
I gotta build up my...

599
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,270
I gotta build up my...

600
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,130
my power level.

601
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,290
I wish there was an in-between though.

602
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,190
I feel like maybe the normal mode...

603
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,370
Not that it's so easy, but...

604
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,230
I think I'm just making silly mistakes, you know what I
mean?

605
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:42,810
Is this way?

606
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:43,530
There we go.

607
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,260
Okay, this way.

608
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:49,540
Oh.

609
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,240
Potato...

610
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,440
Come in, thank you!

611
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,640
Wow, whoa, whoa, whoa!

612
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,320
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

613
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,460
Oh my gosh, so many roaches!

614
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,620
Thank you, potato!

615
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:06,980
Ah!

616
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,240
Welcome!

617
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,610
I felt like a little bit like a homing...

618
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,130
Like a homing, uh, Danmaku.

619
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,800
Oh, I'm not good at the...

620
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,300
Oh my gosh.

621
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,920
Why does this feel more difficult than the hard mode?

622
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,180
But...

623
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,240
Bunk!

624
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,120
No bunk!

625
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,260
No bunk!

626
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,540
I'm not good at the directional with the bunk hammer.

627
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,860
Yumi Yumi!

628
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:46,820
Yumi!

629
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:47,700
Oh!

630
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,600
We're already here!

631
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,800
Where is he?

632
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,140
Ow!

633
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
Oh, there he is!

634
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,260
Ah!

635
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,420
Oh, I've died!

636
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,280
Please, I just want to fight the boys!

637
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,000
What a way to die.

638
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,320
It was so stupid.

639
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,320
It was actually so dumb.

640
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,800
It was actually so stupid.

641
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,480
I don't like the machine gun because it pushes you into,
like, other...

642
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,180
To other Damaku.

643
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:28,740
What?

644
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,320
What?

645
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:29,620
What?

646
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,540
There we go.

647
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,760
Yeah, get his butt.

648
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,760
Get that guy's butt.

649
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,500
Yeah, get his butt, get his butt, get his...

650
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,960
But I'm trying to go this way.

651
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,060
Yes, no!

652
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,560
A shot of gun!

653
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,300
Hey, okay.

654
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,980
Oh, I'm done.

655
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:51,980
Thank you, forever.

656
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,880
I...

657
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,120
You're such a pro gamer, VTuber.

658
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,380
Thanks.

659
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,340

660
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,240
11.

661
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,300

662
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,640

Oh.

667
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,120
I shouldn't waste these.

668
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,640
Oh, gosh.

669
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,400
I shouldn't waste these.

670
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,100
Bye, dog.

671
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:53,880
Yumi, Yumi.

672
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,080
Oh, my God.

673
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,080
Not the roaches, please.

674
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,900
Not the roaches.

675
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,720
Why are they so fast?

676
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,920
Also, wait.

677
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,900
Does this cut through?

678
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,100
Oh, it does.

679
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:17,700
Oh.

680
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,960
That's kind of nice.

681
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,200
Doesn't help if they're coming from behind.

682
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,200
I don't know what my favorite weapon is yet.

683
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,400
Oh, oh wait, should that?

684
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,060
That's okay?

685
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,780
No, not nice!

686
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,100
Not nice!

687
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,410
Hand mine.

688
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,610
Wait, how many more weapons do we have?

689
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,730
I was so close to getting the boss again.

690
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,610
Yuppie, yuppie, yuppie, yuppie.

691
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:08,670
Machine gun, shotgun.

692
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,440
Chain zone!

693
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,680
Nice!

694
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,140
Hopped in to say hi.

695
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:19,620
Hello!

696
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,140
Things are dapping back.

697
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,760
Oh, there's still quite a lot actually that we haven't
unlocked.

698
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,160
Let's go.

699
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,620
Let's go back to this one actually.

700
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,160
Let's try that.

701
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,100
Have confidence.

702
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,580
Okay.

703
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,180
Have confidence.

704
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:39,840
She said...

705
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,260
Eggs, potato.

706
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:50,680
Bunk.

707
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,420
Bunk.

708
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:52,840
Bunk, bunk, bunk.

709
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:53,760
Bunk, bunk.

710
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:53,920
Bunk, bunk.

711
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,360
Bunk.

712
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,180
Wait, is it this way?

713
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:56,680
Nope.

714
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,000
Hmm...

715
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:01,730
Oh!

716
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,450
Oh!

717
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,250
Have a confidence, everybody.

718
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,510
Shoot nothing!

719
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,130
Hit everything!

720
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,110
I always lose or miss the chainsaw!

721
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,330
Oh gosh, please!

722
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:25,830
Please!

723
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,410
Okay, I'll take the bonk, I'll take the bonk!

724
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,780
Just gotta get through here.

725
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,100
Here we go!

726
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,760

Oh, no!

734
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,280
It's a human time.

735
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,880
I love the...

736
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,640
Oh, it's the ping.

737
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,500
Yeah, it's the ping.

738
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,620
Uh, something, something playing through OBS.

739
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,720
Not really.

740
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,340
That's my favorite opener.

741
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,300
Where's the box?

742
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,160
Oh, oh, all the way down there?

743
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,660
It's always these guys.

744
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,000
They rush you!

745
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,440
They actually rush.

746
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,160
They come in full of confidence.

747
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,060
Oh no no no no no no no no no no no!

748
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,420
Okay, I'm

749
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:14,790
gonna die.

750
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,340
I'm from the chainsaw!

751
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,130
It doesn't seem like it's a bad weapon.

752
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,950
It's just I think I don't know how to properly use it so
well.

753
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,590
See like there is pretty good.

754
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,490
You don't need to judge with the chainsaw.

755
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,470
That was so unlucky.

756
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,450
That was so unlucky.

757
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,230
It was so fast right out of there.

758
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

759
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,490
The chainsaw killing bullets is really good.

760
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:57,290
It is really good.

761
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,860
Are there achievements?

762
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,180
There are steam achievements.

763
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:06,400
Yeah.

764
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,940
Let's go sunshine, amigo.

765
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,480
Sunshine.

766
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,440
I've been getting some of them.

767
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,940
Like, collect 200 Korone boxes.

768
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,160
Stuff like that.

769
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,880
I thought it would kill him in one hit.

770
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,480
I was wrong.

771
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,240
It's okay.

772
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,820
They can stay over there in their little corner.

773
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,960
Get me out of here.

774
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,120
Not the machine gun.

775
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,480
No, machine gun.

776
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,280
I don't like the machine gun.

777
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,400
I have to go back a little bit.

778
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,070
when I use it.

779
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,020
I feel like the machine gun is the worst one.

780
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,600
It's very hard to use.

781
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,860
It's very, it's very hard to use.

782
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,800
Oh my god, there should be a leaderboard.

783
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,380
I'd be top.

784
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,440
Mint Phantom.

785
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,120
Number one.

786
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,200
You'll be collector.

787
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:58,680
Sorry.

788
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,660
Sorry.

789
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:03,500
Oh.

790
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,360
Nice!

791
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,760
They charge once they see you.

792
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,560
Can the bullets like...

793
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,600
Just trying to get this dope.

794
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:53,590
This stage is really hard for the cannon also.

795
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:57,190
Oh, no, I tried to aim up.

796
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:59,830
There we go.

797
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,360
Are you trying to kill me?

798
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:19,350
No, I'm trying to go this way.

799
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:20,330
Please.

800
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,740
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

801
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:30,500
Ow!

802
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,140
There we go.

803
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:34,680
There we go.

804
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,200
Okay, we got, we're getting rid of a few of them at least.

805
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,460
Let's go around.

806
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:42,840
Okay.

807
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,080
If I can get one more box, we can go against the box.

808
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,500
Watch?

809
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,800
Are

810
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,300
you kidding?

811
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,240
It's always the roaches.

812
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,960
It's always the roaches.

813
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,100
Oh my gosh.

814
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,480
You keep jinxing it?

815
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,040
I know.

816
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,420
I'll never get past 11.

817
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,920
Have confidence.

818
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:13,980
Oh, thank you.

819
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,400
Oh, she's so awesome.

820
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,560
She says have confidence.

821
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,200
Get past 11.

822
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,940
Oh, roach bad.

823
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,820
True.

824
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,280
Wait.

825
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,240
Right here.

826
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,560
Oh, whoa, whoa.

827
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,840
Not the hand mine.

828
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,040
Wait, can it...

829
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,080
Oh, it does explode.

830
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,260
Oh, I got the bonk anyway.

831
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:35,880
Oh my gosh.

832
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,120
Shuba, please.

833
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,200
Shuba, please.

834
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,440
Got him before he could come for me.

835
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,590
I could support.

836
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,030
Die!

837
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:56,330
Totally.

838
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,120
Nice aim, thank you.

839
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,220
Change the wall!

840
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:38,920
Okay, to explain, I was trying to hit, like, maybe a wall or
something to explode as many as possible.

841
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,060
But it just wasn't happening.

842
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,220
Who is sending so many?

843
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:13,570
Nice.

844
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:15,850
Of the wall.

845
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:18,110
Come here, you.

846
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:28,910
We got him before.

847
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:30,310
Before.

848
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,830
Guys, I think she might like the revolver a lot.

849
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:38,950
No, it's okay.

850
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:42,630
The explosions from the X potato destroys bullets, too,
right?

851
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,470
Yes, it seems to be the case.

852
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:46,730
That seems to be the case.

853
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,160
Revolver is fine.

854
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:54,840
It's not like...

855
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:56,930
But it's okay.

856
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:57,870
It's not bad.

857
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,600
It's never really...

858
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,160
Is there like a...

859
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,980
Is this a dead end?

860
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:10,680
Oh my gosh.

861
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,480
It is.

862
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,520
Yeah, there's not really a good reason to come down here.

863
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,260
Oh my gosh.

864
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,000
Unless I want to die by Roach!

865
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,320
No, please!

866
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,020
Oh god!

867
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,900
I don't like the Roach.

868
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,180
I don't like the Roach!

869
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,160
No Roach!

870
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:45,820
No Roach!

871
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:46,300
No Roach!

872
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,540
No Roach!

873
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,000
No Roach!

874
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:48,920
No Roach!

875
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:49,420
No Roach!

876
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:49,880
No Roach!

877
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,340
No Roach!

878
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:52,840
No Roach!

879
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:53,320
No Roach!

880
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:53,540
No Roach!

881
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:53,580
No Roach!

882
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:53,800
No Roach!

883
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:53,800
No Roach!

884
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:53,820
No Roach!

885
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:53,820
No Roach!

886
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:54,300
No Roach!

887
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,920
Oh my gosh, please.

888
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,140
Why does it feel like it picks up so much around 5?

889
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,280
Oh my god, please.

890
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,200
Okay, there we go.

891
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,480
Bunk, bunk.

892
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,380
Bunk has too hard, too long of a cooldown, I feel like.

893
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,420
Oh my god, no, no, no, no, no.

894
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,520
He's too...

895
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,420
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

896
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,840
Oh, you're crazy.

897
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:06,080
I was doing so well, but also getting nothing.

898
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:13,190
Roaches are so crazy.

899
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,140
Am I getting worse?

900
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:24,520
Maybe.

901
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,220
Who knows?

902
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,100
That was the most intense gaming I've ever seen.

903
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,440
I don't think I was getting worse.

904
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,340
It was just really hard to get around from there.

905
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:39,260
I think I was getting bad RNG weapons.

906
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:45,420
Because the X can- the potato cannon is great but does not
help in this level.

907
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,200
Oh my gosh.

908
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,620
Does not help at all.

909
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,640
Chainsaw.

910
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,340
Chainsaw.

911
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,480
Chainsaw.

912
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,040
Wow.

913
00:51:59,380 --> 00:51:59,740
Chainsaw.

914
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:12,770
Oh, okay.

915
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:13,790
This is- this works.

916
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,260
Uh, open here.

917
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:20,780
Ah!

918
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,320
Okay, nice.

919
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,140
Uh, this way.

920
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,860
Okay.

921
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,540
Hi, okay.

922
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,600
Yumi, yumi, yumi, yumi, yumi, yumi, yumi, yumi, yumi, yumi.

923
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,660
Tara's gonna hear this and she's gonna...

924
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:05,480
You know what?

925
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:05,860
Good.

926
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:06,780
Let her hear it.

927
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,000
I'm destroying her precious...

928
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,320
I'm not

929
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,060
even...

930
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,640
It's a pathetic way to die ever.

931
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,020
You did that all to yourself.

932
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:34,660
I did.

933
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:35,400
I did.

934
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,060
It's always 11.

935
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,700
I know I got a hit in.

936
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,080
I got a hit in.

937
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,680
Let's go sunshine, amigo.

938
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:44,420
Sunshine!

939
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:46,660
If

940
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,850
I put one down and then another.

941
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:54,190
Oh, interesting.

942
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:57,050
So I should just start putting them down everywhere.

943
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:58,630
Yubi Yubi!

944
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,660
Oh, I can shoot now.

945
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,460
I can shoot now.

946
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:21,640
Tain soul.

947
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:22,860
Yubi Yubi!

948
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,720
Bunk, bunk, bunk, bunk.

949
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,760
This is it.

950
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,920
Back this way, back this way, back this way.

951
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:42,960
Yeah!

952
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,640
Hit everything and nothing!

953
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,460
Hit everything and...

954
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,300
Oh, that was close, that was close, that was close.

955
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,920
No, no, no, no, not machine gun, not machine gun.

956
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,140
Please no, please no, not machine gun, not machine gun.

957
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:13,870
Nice.

958
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:14,930
Sorry.

959
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:17,730
I shouldn't, I shouldn't, um, maybe...

960
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:19,930
Are you kidding me?

961
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:28,550
Um...

962
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:29,670
There's no way!

963
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,650
There's no way I could have fought the boss with...

964
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:34,110
With the hand mines!

965
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,590
There's no way!

966
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,050
That RNG was so bad.

967
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:39,130
Ah!

968
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:40,790
Ah!

969
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,770
Worst weapon for the boss!

970
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:43,910
That was so bad!

971
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,170
We got there so quickly too!

972
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:49,050
Ah!

973
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:52,600
I'm a ghost!

974
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,800
Bunk, bunk!

975
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,120
Sorry, man.

976
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:05,660
It's okay.

977
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:06,980
I'm having

978
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,190
fun.

979
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:15,510
Oh, this way.

980
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:27,980
That's part of the game, you know?

981
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,380
Is you just, uh...

982
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,480
Try and try and try and try and try again.

983
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,680
It's one of those fast-paced games, you know?

984
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:40,960
Wait, wait.

985
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:41,820
Oh, it's this way.

986
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,860
Oh my god, no, no, no, no!

987
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,400
Nice.

988
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:49,840
Okay.

989
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,080
Whew, that was close.

990
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,920
That was a close one.

991
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,940
It can kind of help launch you where you need to go.

992
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,420
But also, it's not...

993
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,600
Not easy.

994
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:02,880
Oh, shoot.

995
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,020
We're so close.

996
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,580
It's very addictive for sure.

997
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,260
Quick reset is a lot of fun.

998
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,680
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

999
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,240
Yeah, for sure.

1000
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,290
The curse is broken.

1001
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:33,950
You didn't get 11 this time.

1002
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:34,970
Let's go sunshine!

1003
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,350
Yeah we got worse!

1004
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:41,090
We didn't get 11, we got worse!

1005
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:43,410
Listener sign.

1006
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,850
Putting you out of your misery.

1007
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,550
We're gonna...

1008
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:07,750
Oh my gosh.

1009
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:10,250
Shotgun.

1010
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:11,210
Yubi Yubi!

1011
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:29,690
Oh, that one.

1012
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:35,450
Let's hit him.

1013
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,210
Not nice.

1014
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:39,770
Not nice.

1015
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:41,670
I need to go.

1016
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,870
I'm learning more how to control this.

1017
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:57,930
I'm learning more how to control it, I think.

1018
00:58:58,210 --> 00:58:59,350
So, to go.

1019
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,800
Shuba sniped.

1020
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,680
No confidence.

1021
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:28,820
No confidence.

1022
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,680
You're never going to beat a boss.

1023
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,260
We will.

1024
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,020
The stream will end until we beat a boss.

1025
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:38,400
Actually, I am going to switch to...

1026
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,760
We got to unlock a new weapon.

1027
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,120
Let's switch to this place.

1028
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,820
I think this one is easier for the cannon.

1029
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,060
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1030
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,740
Aqua super day.

1031
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:52,940
Yubby, yubby.

1032
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:24,490
Sometimes, I'll be honest.

1033
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,390
arrow pointing towards the...

1034
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:34,610
Pointing towards the next box makes me feel like that's
where I'm pointing at.

1035
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:35,890
So if you think I'm...

1036
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:40,470
If you see me making a mistake like that, that's exactly
what I'm thinking.

1037
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:47,370
I'm looking at the arrow as if it's where I'm pointing my
weapon you know.

1038
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:50,630
Because my brain is silly.

1039
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:59,610
Maybe this map isn't as good!

1040
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,960
Maybe this map is really difficult!

1041
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,520
11 seems to be your lucky number.

1042
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,780
Oh, thank you.

1043
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,420
Thank you for the 11-11.

1044
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:14,740
Oh my gosh.

1045
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,000
Everyone play the lottery?

1046
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:18,920
Play the lottery?

1047
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,220
Use 11.

1048
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:33,780
Should I say Dunkin' Pong?

1049
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:41,580
Does this also get rid of the, uh...

1050
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,940
Does this also get rid of the missing gun?

1051
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,020
The bullets?

1052
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:52,040
Oh my god, no, no!

1053
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:54,200
Ah!

1054
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:55,580
Yeah!

1055
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,010
It's just a gun!

1056
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,820
Uh, this way.

1057
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,580
I did not shoot.

1058
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:12,920
Let's go, amigo!

1059
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:13,800
Let's go!

1060
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,260
Listener, son, please.

1061
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,120
Why would you treat your Oshi like this?

1062
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,240
They know I'm a phony.

1063
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,400
They know I'm a phony.

1064
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:32,000
Maybe this one is actually more difficult because it's a
little bit more open.

1065
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:42,520
Hug me!

1066
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,280
Hug me!

1067
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:43,520
Hug me!

1068
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:43,660
Hug me!

1069
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:43,940
Hug me!

1070
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,580
Get out of my way!

1071
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:51,930
Power, please!

1072
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:56,530
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1073
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:01,010
Not exactly what I was thinking, but...

1074
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:06,070
It will maybe do the trick.

1075
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,370
Oh, I don't think I got...

1076
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:10,910
It's a dog!

1077
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:12,290
Why are you so fast?

1078
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:16,150
The circle!

1079
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:41,030
Could be worse.

1080
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:42,490
Could be way worse.

1081
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:44,370
Could be way worse.

1082
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:46,230
The dogs just run through...

1083
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,690
Oh my god.

1084
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:47,570
Oh my god.

1085
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:48,550
Oh my god.

1086
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:51,030
The dogs just run through the chainsaw.

1087
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:51,550
It's crazy.

1088
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:06,530
I'm so concentrated right now, you guys.

1089
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:07,630
You have no idea.

1090
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:10,370
Why?

1091
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:12,470
Why Banca?

1092
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:16,450
Okay, where's the... Where's the...

1093
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:20,630
Where's the guy?

1094
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:22,150
Oh, you think he's down here.

1095
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:25,630
This is not easy.

1096
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,040
Um...

1097
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,460
Then we hide behind the trees.

1098
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,240
Wait, I can also bonk these back, right?

1099
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,700
I should have bonked them and bonked the back.

1100
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:57,060
At least you can deflect the bullets or not.

1101
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,800
Come on, Korane.

1102
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:03,700
We got this.

1103
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:05,460
She's like, I've got this.

1104
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:06,400
You!

1105
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,900
On the other hand...

1106
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,000
That is questionable, whether you've got this or...

1107
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,060
Oh, nice!

1108
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,760
Get mined.

1109
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,240
Oh, God.

1110
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:32,240
Yeah.

1111
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:33,760
Nice, nice, nice.

1112
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,040
I didn't see you there!

1113
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,100
Oh, whoa, whoa!

1114
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,020
Shotgun.

1115
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,900
Uh, next one down here.

1116
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:02,210
Where?

1117
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:02,970
Here?

1118
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:06,710
I like the hand mine actually.

1119
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,130
It has a slow...

1120
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:10,610
Oh!

1121
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:15,250
It has a slow recharge but I like being able to control it
too.

1122
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,010
Let's go Sunshine Amigo.

1123
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:18,790
I got a Frisbee!

1124
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:20,810
Let's go Amigo!

1125
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,770
Wait, we unlocked something else!

1126
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:23,670
Wait.

1127
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,050
Yubi Yubi!

1128
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:26,150
Let's see if we get it.

1129
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:27,030
Let's see if we get it.

1130
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:27,630
Frisbee!

1131
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:28,230
Frisbee!

1132
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:29,770
Whack!

1133
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:30,290
Whack!

1134
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:30,530
Whack!

1135
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:33,010
Bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk.

1136
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:35,230
Oh,

1137
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,220
she says jankin because it's the hand.

1138
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:47,200
That's cute.

1139
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,240
Oh, that saved me.

1140
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,700
That saved me for real.

1141
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,300
I like that the mines also stay.

1142
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:05,560
They stay too, which is nice.

1143
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:08,300
So I can set them up everywhere and then...

1144
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,520
Wait, just...

1145
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,840
Oh, oh, yeah!

1146
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,780
Does it... Okay, we also can do those.

1147
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:24,040
Maybe if I just loop these...

1148
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:36,010
Okay, nice.

1149
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:37,550
Good job, guys!

1150
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:44,970
We did it!

1151
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:56,010
We did it!

1152
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:56,670
We did it!

1153
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:57,130
We did it!

1154
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:57,650
We did it!

1155
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:58,170
No!

1156
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:05,240
You can die by the frisbee.

1157
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,460
You can die by the frisbee.

1158
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,340
That's how I died.

1159
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:18,600
I got an achievement called Get hit by the frisbee.

1160
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:35,720
A bone meringue.

1161
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,040
The frisbee sucks.

1162
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,500
You can also right click to reflect it.

1163
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:42,000
Oh!

1164
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:49,450
Still congratulations, man.

1165
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:50,090
Thank you.

1166
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:51,690
Yippee!

1167
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:53,950
Thank you for the five-gifted ducky.

1168
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:54,690
Thank you.

1169
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:02,490
I was sending them out like crazy, too.

1170
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:04,590
Okay, though.

1171
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:05,250
That's not fair.

1172
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:08,090
If you can't get hit by the revolver's bullets...

1173
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:08,770
I'm a duck!

1174
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:11,450
You shouldn't be able to get hit by the frisbee either.

1175
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:12,210
Oh my god.

1176
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:13,190
Not already.

1177
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:14,690
Get out of my face.

1178
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:16,910
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

1179
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:19,230
I want to try the frisbee.

1180
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:24,320
Here it is.

1181
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:32,060
But I do want to try it also.

1182
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,690
I think I got him this time.

1183
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:55,500
That was close.

1184
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,560
That was a close one.

1185
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:57,720
Please!

1186
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:05,820
They're so aggressive!

1187
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:07,680
They're so aggressive.

1188
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,400
Ah, my aim.

1189
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:17,240
I'm hoping, I'm like spraying a little bit and praying that
the splash damage gets them.

1190
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:23,740
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my
god, oh my god, oh my god!

1191
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:52,570
No, I'm just, I'm just placing them down.

1192
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:54,410
Change the wall!

1193
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:56,190
Change the wall!

1194
01:10:57,470 --> 01:10:58,410
For Joshi.

1195
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,290
Okay, this is the guy we did before.

1196
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:03,810
Go away, roaches!

1197
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:04,470
Go away!

1198
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:05,530
Go away!

1199
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:07,890
Wait, if I just do this...

1200
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:09,470
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

1201
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:12,070
If I just do this, it's not so bad, right?

1202
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:12,570
Actually.

1203
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,470
It's actually kind of awesome.

1204
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:15,610
Oh,

1205
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:23,880
okay, okay.

1206
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,300
Okay, okay.

1207
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:26,620
Okay.

1208
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,840
Do I get it back, or...

1209
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,200
A bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-

1210
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:37,900
so close.

1211
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,700
Starting to believe.

1212
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:40,700
Ah!

1213
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:43,560
Right click for three.

1214
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:44,220
at once.

1215
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,140
Oh, I keep forgetting to right click on these weapons.

1216
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,980
Like I do it on this one because it...

1217
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:55,460
Instead of like doing the side by side you do the one
direction.

1218
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:01,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no.

1219
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,740
Bunk, bunk, bunk, bunk, bunk.

1220
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,340
I'll take a bunk, I'll take a bunk.

1221
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:23,340
Recharge.

1222
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,760
So I'm not sure how...

1223
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:26,680
Hmm.

1224
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:33,460
YARUHODO YARUHODO What if I right click on this one?

1225
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,060
Is it the same?

1226
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,300
Can't tell actually.

1227
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:06,270
I inhaled so fast that I choked on my spit.

1228
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:09,790
Don't die, I'm already dead!

1229
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:26,350
Dang, these are all like right next to it!

1230
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:30,390
We're already at 6.

1231
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:34,290
I don't even need to...

1232
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:35,730
Machine

1233
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:48,840
gun.

1234
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:49,800
Machine gun.

1235
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:52,900
Oh my god.

1236
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:03,790
Oh, okay.

1237
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:04,650
Oh my god.

1238
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:23,720
Oh my god.

1239
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,840
No, Shuba, please.

1240
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:25,620
Shuba.

1241
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,300
How am I supposed to beat him with the hammer?

1242
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:30,760
Yeah!

1243
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:44,350
Lower him.

1244
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:54,210
I didn't even get a single hit on it.

1245
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:54,570
Oh, there.

1246
01:14:56,810 --> 01:14:57,430
Let's go.

1247
01:14:57,790 --> 01:14:58,190
Lower him.

1248
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:58,650
Let's go sunshine, amigo.

1249
01:14:58,850 --> 01:14:59,310
Sunshine.

1250
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:00,690
Back to 11.

1251
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:01,130
Okay.

1252
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:05,090
11 curse.

1253
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:07,950
Game is tricky though.

1254
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,010
It's fun, but it's...

1255
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:12,110
Also me bad.

1256
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:13,970
But that's okay.

1257
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:15,570
I

1258
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:19,790
like the hand mine.

1259
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:23,850
It's just not good for stuff quick or for...

1260
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:27,990
Yeah, situations where you need to be firing a lot and fast.

1261
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,460
Wait, oh, it's this way.

1262
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:37,160
Why am I going?

1263
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:38,740
Why am I going down?

1264
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1265
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:43,780
Ah,

1266
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:48,600
stop.

1267
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:49,460
Okay.

1268
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,360
Just a wall!

1269
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:53,080
Die.

1270
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:53,980
Die.

1271
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:55,580
Die.

1272
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:07,720
Die.

1273
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:08,180
Please bounce.

1274
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:09,840
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay.

1275
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:14,940
Listener, son.

1276
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:16,980
So small and so easy to miss.

1277
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:18,840
Oh!

1278
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:30,210
Where is it?

1279
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:31,150
Oh, this way.

1280
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:39,540
Okay.

1281
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:41,080
Okay.

1282
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,620
What the?

1283
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,220
What is this?

1284
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:47,680
Pinky pledge.

1285
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:50,620
No confidence.

1286
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:56,760
The terror.

1287
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:58,300
I don't like bugs.

1288
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,940
I hate that one so much.

1289
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:02,540
Ah!

1290
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:07,480
Yeah, I didn't know what that one did, so I was just running
to see if...

1291
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,100
Okay, that's okay.

1292
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:08,400
That's okay.

1293
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:08,940
That's okay.

1294
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,060
It's like race and spell card.

1295
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,520
Not the actual Toho.

1296
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:24,820
I haven't played in Perishable Night.

1297
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,040
I don't even know.

1298
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:31,020
Actually, I'll be honest, I probably have played in
Perishable Night.

1299
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:32,840
The least.

1300
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,380
This wasn't one of my favorites.

1301
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:39,320
Which is okay.

1302
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:47,590
I don't know what the...

1303
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:51,050
It's hard to say, or it's hard for me to figure out what
the...

1304
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:52,990
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1305
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:56,050
How big the splash damage is on the mines.

1306
01:17:58,970 --> 01:17:59,930
There we go.

1307
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:03,090
Take that guy out real fast!

1308
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,090
Shut the gun!

1309
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:11,090
Terraceable Knight is peak.

1310
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:14,490
It's good, it's just not one of my favorites.

1311
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:20,570
I played, um, Mountain of Faith, Must, and, uh, Hello?

1312
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:21,150
Hello?

1313
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:22,210
Hello?

1314
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:27,730
Perishable Night, and, uh...

1315
01:18:28,290 --> 01:18:28,830
Oh, no, no.

1316
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:32,680
Oh my god!

1317
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:33,420
How did I live?

1318
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,500
How am I alive?!

1319
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:45,410
Well, there was one other one.

1320
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:49,410
I played UFO quite a bit.

1321
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:51,370
Let's go, sunshine!

1322
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:52,190
Um...

1323
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:52,650
Sunshine!

1324
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:53,930
Okay, um...

1325
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:55,530
And, uh...

1326
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:02,290
No frisbee, no frisbee, no frisbee, no frisbee!

1327
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:03,270
No frisbee!

1328
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:07,770
Oh god, I'm scared of the frisbee!

1329
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:08,970
I'm scared of the frisbee!

1330
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:10,950
There's gotta get me!

1331
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,340
There's one that I'm...

1332
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,020
Cannot...

1333
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:22,080
Get me!

1334
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:25,100
I don't know why I can't think of which one.

1335
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:39,560
My brain is only consumed by Yubi.

1336
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:41,760
I'm Yubi.

1337
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:42,780
brain right now.

1338
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,000
The overkill.

1339
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:49,920
You know it's not overkill.

1340
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,060
These guys are annoying.

1341
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:57,600
These guys, these tiny little guys are pain in my side.

1342
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:01,160
Pain in my side.

1343
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,120
Oh my god.

1344
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:04,300
Oh my god.

1345
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:05,220
Hello?

1346
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:11,920
No, Shuba.

1347
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:12,780
Oh.

1348
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:13,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1349
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,040
Shuba now!

1350
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,680
I just hear her go Shuba, Shuba, Shuba.

1351
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:25,330
I'm trying to take some of these other guys out.

1352
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:26,430
Oh my god.

1353
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:28,390
Shuba, Shuba, Shuba, Shuba!

1354
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:30,810
Maybe in like here.

1355
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:32,390
Okay, here we go.

1356
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:35,510
Okay, nice.

1357
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:36,750
Nice, nice.

1358
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:37,970
Take him out.

1359
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:39,730
Oh, nope, never mind.

1360
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:42,630
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1361
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:44,090
Oh!

1362
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:52,750
Whoa!

1363
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:53,930
Oh my god.

1364
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:54,890
Oh my god.

1365
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:55,880
That was a close one.

1366
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:57,150
Oh!

1367
01:20:57,530 --> 01:20:58,330
That was a close one.

1368
01:20:58,430 --> 01:20:58,690
Oh my god.

1369
01:20:58,790 --> 01:20:59,310
I'm in danger!

1370
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,450
I'm in danger!

1371
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:02,950
I'm in danger!

1372
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:04,510
I'm in danger, you guys!

1373
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:05,950
I'm in danger, you guys!

1374
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:07,370
I'm in danger, I'm in danger.

1375
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:09,090
I'm in danger, I'm in danger.

1376
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:10,210
I'm in danger, I'm in danger.

1377
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:10,530
Help me!

1378
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:11,270
Help!

1379
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:14,290
Help me!

1380
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:21,690
Nice!

1381
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:25,330
Oh my god.

1382
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:27,990
Screw you!

1383
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:29,150
Little Rouch!

1384
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:32,510
Sorry, dog.

1385
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:33,930
Oh my god, that did not kill dog.

1386
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:35,890
That did not finish off the dog.

1387
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:41,390
Well, let Shuba do her thing over there.

1388
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:44,630
Where is... Oh my god.

1389
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:46,670
Oh my god, there's so many people!

1390
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:48,810
Please, I'm an introvert!

1391
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:50,570
Please, I'm an introvert!

1392
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:52,570
I don't want to talk to anyone!

1393
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:01,740
Okay, okay, okay.

1394
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:13,820
Too real.

1395
01:22:18,110 --> 01:22:19,910
I only count up to 14, you guys.

1396
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:23,890
This is intense.

1397
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:29,070
I don't think, you know what, I intended on this being a
short stream anyway, because I just wanted to, you know,

1398
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:35,590
hang out a little bit today, but I don't think I can
physically handle the amount of stress this game gives me.

1399
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:39,990
For so long.

1400
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:42,310
Keep

1401
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:48,720
playing.

1402
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,280
Next scene, thank you for the 50, thank you.

1403
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,180
No, we're still gonna go!

1404
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:00,480
I'm not done yet.

1405
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,100
I'm having fun.

1406
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,500
It's just terrifying.

1407
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:11,420
It's a fun terrifying, right?

1408
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:13,920
I'm scared.

1409
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:16,840
And also...

1410
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,020
Like these guys!

1411
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:22,380
Oh!

1412
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:28,040
Oh!

1413
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:39,160
Oh!

1414
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,060
I ran right

1415
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,450
into it.

1416
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:55,600
Oh!

1417
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,740
Why am I so bad in this game?

1418
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:02,620
No!

1419
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:03,220
No confidence.

1420
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:03,600
Oh!

1421
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:05,300
What go...

1422
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:05,560
What?

1423
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:07,300
I saw someone say they got a score of 30.

1424
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:08,160
I'm happy.

1425
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:09,340
Halfway there, almost.

1426
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:12,220
I'm almost halfway there.

1427
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:14,820
I'm almost halfway there.

1428
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:15,340
I'm almost halfway there.

1429
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,140
Hello?

1430
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:16,780
It's a dog.

1431
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:17,960
It's a dog.

1432
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:26,610
That was scary.

1433
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:35,020
This way.

1434
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:35,480
Oh wait.

1435
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,440
There we go.

1436
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,200
I got 30 and unlock the neon cannons.

1437
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:45,880
What's that?

1438
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:46,140
Wait.

1439
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:46,980
I want a cat.

1440
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:47,780
What's that?

1441
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:48,980
What's it do?

1442
01:24:52,860 --> 01:25:02,020
this is just definitely something I can see myself like
playing and you know I'm like oh I have a well I was gonna

1443
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:16,440
say when I have a free extra a couple of minutes that's
quite rare but frisbee please frisbee it'd be fine if the if

1444
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,040
the dog chased after the frisbee

1445
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,020
Can you move?

1446
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:24,640
No!

1447
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,700
I needed to get to the box!

1448
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:29,320
Where is it?

1449
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,820
Stop chasing after my...

1450
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:36,660
Why are you so obsessed with me?

1451
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:38,420
There we go.

1452
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:39,180
Okay.

1453
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:42,250
Okay, okay.

1454
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:43,470
Okay, okay.

1455
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:44,950
Oh, ha!

1456
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,800
Defense!

1457
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:05,590
That was absolutely 100% me.

1458
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:08,370
That was 100% Me being greedy.

1459
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:09,830
What's wrong with me?

1460
01:26:10,150 --> 01:26:11,290
Why did I do that?

1461
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:12,970
That was me being greedy.

1462
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:14,630
My greed.

1463
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:16,610
Don't be greedy.

1464
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:17,110
Oh my gosh.

1465
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:17,990
Me Ling told me.

1466
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:21,870
Let's go sunshine, amigo.

1467
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:22,490
Sunshine.

1468
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,050
Okay, I'm gonna pretend you guys aren't here.

1469
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:25,950
Okay, sorry.

1470
01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:29,870
I'm gonna pretend you guys don't even exist.

1471
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:40,700
Concentration.

1472
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:44,640
I didn't see it.

1473
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:46,620
I didn't see it!

1474
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,780
I didn't see it.

1475
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:52,160
Ah, dang it.

1476
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,540
Ah, it's okay though.

1477
01:28:58,280 --> 01:28:59,320
Forever 19!

1478
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:00,380
Woohoo!

1479
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,800
Ah, you're pretty good.

1480
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,600
Just blame it on us.

1481
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,480
Say you peaked.

1482
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:08,820
Okay.

1483
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,760
I missed you guys a little bit, you know.

1484
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:15,400
So I just, you know, had to make sure you were okay.

1485
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,620
You were locked in there for a minute.

1486
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:23,640
There were some parts that I got really lucky.

1487
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:30,580
There's some parts though that I got really lucky that I
shouldn't have won, I think.

1488
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:31,820
Nice focus run.

1489
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:32,460
Thank you.

1490
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:35,000
Thank you.

1491
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:40,020
See, if I pretend I'm not streaming, it's a little...

1492
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:41,280
See, I can't do alright.

1493
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,220
I can do a little bit better.

1494
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,040
See, performance anxiety is a real thing.

1495
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:48,380
It was great watching your faces.

1496
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:49,740
You got certain weapons ready.

1497
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,120
Wakari, welcome to Membushib.

1498
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:53,720
Thank you.

1499
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:54,580
Oh my gosh.

1500
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:56,760
My left contact.

1501
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:00,360
I mean, my right contact.

1502
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:01,960
Ah.

1503
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:05,100
It's so...

1504
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:05,260
Ah.

1505
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:07,760
Ah.

1506
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:10,740
It's so...

1507
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:11,160
It's so...

1508
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,340
I've been up so weird today.

1509
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:13,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1510
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,600
I don't know what's up with.

1511
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:15,760
it.

1512
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,740
We haven't done the first stage in a while.

1513
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,560
I will go back to it after this round.

1514
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,680
Though I do think this is my favorite.

1515
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:30,120
It's not the easiest, but I like it.

1516
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:47,180
Chinsu!

1517
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:50,220
Hello?

1518
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,240
Oh, that was good timing.

1519
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:04,390
wear glasses ever.

1520
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:10,640
I absolutely hate glasses on me.

1521
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:21,870
Especially because, um, wearing them with, uh, headset, um,
it digs into my ears and gives me really bad headaches.

1522
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:27,690
So, I don't wear them.

1523
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:30,530
Oh, that was fast.

1524
01:31:30,950 --> 01:31:36,970
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I shot myself into the dog.

1525
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:40,570
I shot myself into the dog.

1526
01:31:42,050 --> 01:31:42,330
Yeah.

1527
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:45,530
I started wearing earbuds for that reason.

1528
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:47,350
Yeah, yeah, it makes sense, right?

1529
01:31:50,350 --> 01:31:52,530
I like the look of them, but they are so annoying to wear.

1530
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:54,950
Yeah, I like the look of them.

1531
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:57,870
Well, actually, I don't really particularly like how they
look on me.

1532
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:00,890
I like how they look on other people.

1533
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:04,390
Or maybe that...

1534
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:06,150
Oh, wait, sorry, I forgot to go to the other stage.

1535
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:09,410
Maybe that's just me...

1536
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:12,470
Like, what's the word?

1537
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:19,430
Uh, trying to make it so I don't like them so that I don't
want to wear them.

1538
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:20,030
You know what I mean?

1539
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:21,530
Oh, that was up.

1540
01:32:21,690 --> 01:32:22,510
Why am I so silly?

1541
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:24,510
Bye-bye!

1542
01:32:31,950 --> 01:32:32,910
Get out of here.

1543
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:33,590
Oh!

1544
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:35,830
That was...

1545
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:37,230
Oh, my gosh.

1546
01:32:37,770 --> 01:32:41,730
That was so stupid lucky.

1547
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:44,010
Shabbat!

1548
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:45,750
Shabbat!

1549
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:50,190
Okay, I can leave.

1550
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,320
Oops.

1551
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:56,940
Oops.

1552
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:00,360
Oops.

1553
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:08,220
Bunk, bunk.

1554
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:15,770
No frisbee.

1555
01:33:16,210 --> 01:33:16,710
Bunk!

1556
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:23,920
Okay.

1557
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:24,920
So do come!

1558
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:27,760
Maybe...

1559
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,380
Oh, not the worst for...

1560
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:31,660
Where is he?

1561
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:33,040
Oh!

1562
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:34,020
Oh!

1563
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:39,680
Ha!

1564
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:40,360

01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:49,560

1566
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,220
Not the roaches!

1567
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:52,880
Not the roaches!

1568
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,520
Go away!

1569
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,840

Yeah, you didn't fix it, though.

1574
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:21,520
It's always...

1575
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:21,980
Oh, my gosh.

1576
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,800
Oh, God, my contact.

1577
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:24,440
It's like...

1578
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,460
I think it's just dry.

1579
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:27,320
Oh!

1580
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,200
Oops, I forgot to change those.

1581
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:32,980
Um...

1582
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,640
That's because I'm not blinking.

1583
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:38,280
My...

1584
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:39,940

1586
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:52,840
box keep

1587
01:35:56,990 --> 01:36:02,690
placing them around um where they spawn

1588
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:20,510
hydration check yes i will hydrate

1589
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:41,620
Oh, Joshi again.

1590
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,320
That's okay, because we were gonna do this anyway.

1591
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:53,740
Red box.

1592
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,380
I hear him.

1593
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:12,720
Where are you?

1594
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:13,500
Yumi, Yumi!

1595
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,280
Where are you?

1596
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:33,980
It's weird not being used to this stage!

1597
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,640
Oh my god, please.

1598
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:40,760
Oh, I have an itch.

1599
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:42,280
Don't spawn.

1600
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:43,740
Okay, thank you.

1601
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:09,170
That also requires me to...

1602
01:38:09,170 --> 01:38:10,030
Oh my god!

1603
01:38:12,430 --> 01:38:13,070
Be...

1604
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:15,950
Oh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

1605
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:18,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1606
01:38:19,630 --> 01:38:21,010
There's so many people!

1607
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:25,790
An extrovert is what I was trying to say.

1608
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:29,530
Do you hear that?

1609
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:31,590
You hear that?

1610
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:38,590
The box is...

1611
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:49,030
Oh my god.

1612
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:52,010
Why does the stage feel the most crowded as possible?

1613
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:54,990
And those guys are so fast.

1614
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:13,180
Pinky again!

1615
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:14,920
Oh, oh my god.

1616
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:15,720
Oh my god.

1617
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:17,960
That was...

1618
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:18,500
Whoa!

1619
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:20,900
How am I alive?

1620
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:24,780
Actually, I have no idea how I'm alive right now.

1621
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:26,780
I should have died.

1622
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:28,540
I should have died.

1623
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:33,920
I should have died, I should have died, I should have died,
I should have died, I should have died, I should have died.

1624
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,180
What is my hitbox anyway?

1625
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:42,840
What even is my hitbox?

1626
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:48,530
How did I hit it?

1627
01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:51,090
Very tiny.

1628
01:39:51,290 --> 01:39:52,770
It clearly is very tiny.

1629
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:54,830
If I press shift, will I see it?

1630
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:03,420
That wasn't maybe the best weapon.

1631
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:04,800
Well, it was good, but also...

1632
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:09,900
Not so easy for me.

1633
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:11,840
I hate Frisbee.

1634
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:12,760
No Frisbee.

1635
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:14,740
No Frisbee.

1636
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:16,140
No Frisbee.

1637
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:17,340
No Frisbee.

1638
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:21,820
Yeah, it's not great for bosses.

1639
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:22,640
Yeah, that's for sure.

1640
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:23,700
This is because it's weak.

1641
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:26,540
Hard to find them.

1642
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:29,700
Oh, oh, this way.

1643
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:33,160
Also, I'm not familiar with this map.

1644
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,260
Where is the box?

1645
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:40,460
Oh, no, no,

1646
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:44,660
no!

1647
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,180
Um, this is...

1648
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:46,720
Leave

1649
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,730
me alone.

1650
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:58,410
Oh, oh my gosh!

1651
01:40:58,870 --> 01:40:59,390
Oh my gosh!

1652
01:40:59,850 --> 01:41:00,050
Ah!

1653
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,360
Oh, am I able to bomb?

1654
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:20,680
Oh!

1655
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:30,120
Okay, this way.

1656
01:41:37,290 --> 01:41:37,890
Really?

1657
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:43,700
I don't want to fight the boss with the mind, though.

1658
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:46,880
No confidence.

1659
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:54,810
What if we get to the bot?

1660
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:58,770
What if we get to the boss on hard?

1661
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,340
Oh, wait, we did.

1662
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:06,980
We did.

1663
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:09,040
Okay, we can do it again.

1664
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:10,680
We can do it again.

1665
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:21,180
Go.

1666
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:21,960
I believe.

1667
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,040
I don't believe.

1668
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,900
My gosh, girls.

1669
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:34,080
I'm running up on me!

1670
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:36,300
Oh, I forgot we're in hard mode.

1671
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:39,280
I was like, why are there so many people already?

1672
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:41,760
Oh, I'm done.

1673
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,480
It's a lack of confidence thing, everybody.

1674
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,640
It's a confidence thing, everybody.

1675
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:51,800
I forgot we were on hard mode.

1676
01:42:58,620 --> 01:43:00,760
Oh, wow, they shoot so many more, too.

1677
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:01,940
I just realized.

1678
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:06,340
So I think everyone's faster and also...

1679
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:09,640
They shoot more.

1680
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:14,660
Yeah, this guy shoots way better.

1681
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:15,340
Oh!

1682
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:16,600
Wait, what did I hit?

1683
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,460
I actually didn't notice at all.

1684
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:19,680
Thank you, bye!

1685
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:20,460
Thank you for the five!

1686
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:21,200
Thank you!

1687
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:22,760
What did I hit?

1688
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:31,780
Revolver, Corroselot.

1689
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:33,840
It was a fast bullet.

1690
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:34,860
Oh, it was a bullet.

1691
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:35,500
I thought I could.

1692
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:35,800
Okay.

1693
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:37,860
Wow.

1694
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:38,760
I'm regressing?

1695
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,700
Let's go, amigo!

1696
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:41,340
For real.

1697
01:43:56,770 --> 01:44:00,570
Once again, the revolver seems to be a winner.

1698
01:44:02,050 --> 01:44:08,250
The revolver seems to be a real winner in this game.

1699
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:20,040
I think it's actually super good.

1700
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:40,980
Okay, I know this is going to sound like cope, but I pressed
D and I didn't.

1701
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:45,700
Wait, I know this is going to sound like cope, but it was
actually my keyboard.

1702
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,680
I know it sounds like cope for real.

1703
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:51,700
But it was actually my keyboard!

1704
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:54,860
Sure!

1705
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:55,900
No!

1706
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:56,700
It was!

1707
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:58,340
It was!

1708
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:00,020
It was!

1709
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:01,000
It sounds like cope!

1710
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:02,600
But I...

1711
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:07,160
You know, you guys know that I'm the first to admit when I'm
actually bad at something.

1712
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:12,520
You guys know I wouldn't cope like that!

1713
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:14,560
You guys know!

1714
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:14,840
Oh!

1715
01:45:50,730 --> 01:45:53,370
Ah, this way...

1716
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:55,250
No machine gun.

1717
01:45:56,010 --> 01:45:56,350
Oh, good.

1718
01:45:56,550 --> 01:45:58,870
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1719
01:46:00,150 --> 01:46:00,530
Yubby!

1720
01:46:04,170 --> 01:46:05,390
He's Josie again.

1721
01:46:05,530 --> 01:46:07,190
Those guys are really fast.

1722
01:46:07,490 --> 01:46:08,530
These ones, these ones.

1723
01:46:09,170 --> 01:46:10,210
I have to watch out for those.

1724
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:16,340
Where is he?

1725
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:16,640
Oh!

1726
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:17,140
Oh!

1727
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:17,720
Oh!

1728
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:18,080
Oh!

1729
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:20,700
Oh!

1730
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:21,340
Oh my god!

1731
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:22,160
Oh my god!

1732
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,120
Um, I think you are, it's like...

1733
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:36,960
Sounds like rhymes with hope.

1734
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:40,040
I've only known you for a week or two, Mint, so go.

1735
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:41,880
You know what?

1736
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,780
That's so fair.

1737
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,040
That's so fair.

1738
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:46,480
Wow!

1739
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,840
Me now, because it's the boss, you guys.

1740
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:53,220
The 11 is the boss.

1741
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:54,480
11 is the boss!

1742
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:55,160
Alright.

1743
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:56,240
Let's go, amigo!

1744
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:57,320
Let's go!

1745
01:46:57,740 --> 01:46:58,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1746
01:46:58,740 --> 01:46:59,400
One more try.

1747
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:03,840
One more try.

1748
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:08,340
Last.

1749
01:47:08,620 --> 01:47:09,780
LG, LG, everybody.

1750
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:12,400
LG, LG, LG.

1751
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:15,400
LG, LG.

1752
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:19,140
Oh, I'm not.

1753
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:19,680
No, hold on.

1754
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:21,640
Hold on.

1755
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:27,380
LG, one more time.

1756
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:32,480
It's because...

1757
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,000
Like, I know I ran into it.

1758
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:35,500
The, um...

1759
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:38,480
I forget that the chainsaw also pushes you.

1760
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:41,480
Just like how the, uh, machine gun does.

1761
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,260
Oh, I've died.

1762
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:44,280
Thank you, forever.

1763
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:46,960
LG, round three!

1764
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:48,500
Let's go!

1765
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:52,510
When I say LG, I mean, um...

1766
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:55,000
One more try getting to the boss.

1767
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:56,880
Oh my god, already.

1768
01:47:59,000 --> 01:47:59,540
Okay.

1769
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:00,400
Okay.

1770
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:05,560
Why am I not shooting?

1771
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:07,060
What's wrong with me?

1772
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:08,700
Maybe I'm already checked out.

1773
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:10,200
Maybe I'm like, you know what?

1774
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:11,360
I'm done with this game.

1775
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:16,620
I don't want to play with you anymore.

1776
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:23,560
My roach trauma.

1777
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:28,860
Wait, actually?

1778
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:29,360
Oh, no.

1779
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:29,680
Wait.

1780
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:30,280
Oh, is this way?

1781
01:48:57,110 --> 01:48:58,190
Okay, that's new.

1782
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:02,570
Okay, that's...

1783
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:04,970
I didn't know.

1784
01:49:07,490 --> 01:49:08,610
Did it ever do that?

1785
01:49:08,770 --> 01:49:09,870
No, it didn't.

1786
01:49:10,390 --> 01:49:12,390
That's hard mode, baby.

1787
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:16,410
TV table chair.

1788
01:49:16,770 --> 01:49:17,510
Thank you for the day.

1789
01:49:17,810 --> 01:49:18,230
I'm sorry.

1790
01:49:18,350 --> 01:49:20,170
I feel like I've just been screaming this whole time.

1791
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:20,650
You know what?

1792
01:49:20,730 --> 01:49:21,830
Maybe we'll call it here.

1793
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:29,340
Give my throat a rest.

1794
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:29,640
No.

1795
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:31,240
No, I don't feel satisfied.

1796
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:32,940
I won't feel satisfied.

1797
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:33,940
Try to walk.

1798
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:34,740
Never mind.

1799
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:36,200
LG.

1800
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:37,140
LG.

1801
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:38,080
LG.

1802
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:40,720
LG again.

1803
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,880
I wish I could just have the revolver the whole time.

1804
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:51,820
Machine gun.

1805
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:53,540
Oh, shooting

1806
01:49:58,270 --> 01:49:58,830
backwards!

1807
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:18,780
Oh, this way.

1808
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,740
Oh my god, they're all here.

1809
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:28,000
Go away!

1810
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:32,540
Go away, go away, go away.

1811
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:33,360
Let me...

1812
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:33,880
Okay.

1813
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,860
Bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk.

1814
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:37,980
Bonk, bonk, bonk.

1815
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:30,720
lose to this little listener's hat, I might actually become
the Joker!

1816
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:46,040
I was moving up, but I was too slow, I did it all right.

1817
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:48,200
Ah!

1818
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:57,660
Ah!

1819
01:51:58,540 --> 01:51:58,980
Ah!

1820
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:00,600
Ah!

1821
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:03,960
The dark?

1822
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:04,540
No, no, no.

1823
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:07,280
It was if I died to the little guy, but I was fine.

1824
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:10,460
Instead, I... I was moving up, but the...

1825
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:11,060
I don't know.

1826
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:12,260
I don't... I don't know.

1827
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:13,320
What?

1828
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:16,500
I mean, I guess obviously you hit my hitbox, but...

1829
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:16,500
Hmm.

1830
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:19,160
This stream could have its own scream compilation.

1831
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:21,940
I'm the Joker.

1832
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:25,480
Then keep going.

1833
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:29,940
All it takes is one bad day.

1834
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,380
Did you guys see the trailer for the next Joker movie?

1835
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:36,300
The one with, uh...

1836
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:38,180
Hold on, I'm fixing my contact again.

1837
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:39,760
Oh, my eye hurt so bad.

1838
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:40,920
Um...

out the frisbee killing you is a reference to the original

1841
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:10,460
game super crate box that this game plays homage to from
2010 where the disc gun could bounce back and kill you ah

1842
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:13,240
that makes Does that make sense?

1843
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:16,440
Joker 2 with Joaquin and Lady Gaga.

1844
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:17,620
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1845
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:21,300
We live in a musical.

1846
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:26,520
Yeah, Lady Gaga is playing Harley Quinn.

1847
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:28,480
It actually looks so good.

1848
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:32,440
Oh, it isn't out until October.

1849
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:33,940
Who said that they saw it?

1850
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:38,040
Everyone knows it's only LG if it's a good round.

1851
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:40,220
Andragos, thanks for the time.

1852
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:41,040
Gifted.

1853
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:41,860
Thank you so much.

1854
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:42,280
Thank you.

1855
01:53:44,120 --> 01:54:00,000
don't care for the casting it's I think it's hold on I think
it's different yes like I wouldn't expect Harley Quinn to be

1856
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:10,880
Lady Gaga but I don't think I mind it so much either me when
I spread misinformation I'm spreading misinformation on the

1857
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:25,960
internet that's me when I spread misinformation I think I'll
still see it though I really like the first one lady Gaga

1858
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:35,660
was great in American horror story so I'll reserve judgment
I think I tend to like lady Gaga a lot because people tend

1859
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:51,900
to underestimate her like back in the day before she was
like like not back in the day like when she was still like

1860
01:54:51,900 --> 01:54:59,180
pop-up a poker face kind of lady gaga like people you know

1865
01:55:32,250 --> 01:55:35,990
undoctored kodone quote um

1866
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:47,800
but yeah before when she was when lady gauga was still like
poker face lady people didn't know that she could sing but

1867
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:50,000
She can sing so well, actually.

1868
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:54,000
She's...

1869
01:55:55,340 --> 01:55:56,320
She's good.

1870
01:56:03,410 --> 01:56:03,910
Wait!

1871
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:07,350
Oh, I'm on hard mode again, I forgot.

1872
01:56:08,350 --> 01:56:09,230
No, Frisbee!

1873
01:56:10,690 --> 01:56:11,490
No, Frisbee!

1874
01:56:22,850 --> 01:56:23,890
Scared of Frisbee.

1875
01:56:24,730 --> 01:56:25,850
Don't do

1876
01:56:38,830 --> 01:56:39,470
that, mister.

1877
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:42,150
Don't do that, mister.

1878
01:56:52,150 --> 01:56:58,890
I think this game has proven to me that my throat is never
going to recover.

1879
01:56:59,050 --> 01:57:01,570
I'm always going to be raspy for the rest of my life.

1880
01:57:03,630 --> 01:57:06,750
I think I'm always going to sound raspy for the rest of my
life.

1881
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:31,830
Every time she says that...

1882
01:57:31,830 --> 01:57:36,450
It makes me think, It makes me think, Which is, you know,
like...

1883
01:57:37,410 --> 01:57:40,770
It reminds me of Freerun being in the mimic mouth.

1884
01:57:41,630 --> 01:57:43,590
Oh, I haven't gotten this in a while.

1885
01:57:44,530 --> 01:57:45,190
Oh my gosh.

1886
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:50,300
Overkill, but that's okay.

1887
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:52,920
Yumi, Yumi!

1888
01:57:59,180 --> 01:57:59,420
Yumi!

1889
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:05,120
That's me in this game.

1890
01:58:06,340 --> 01:58:06,860
Kawaiyo!

1891
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:07,580
Kawaiyo!

1892
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:08,840
Kawaiyo!

1893
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:09,360
Kawaiyo!

1894
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:09,880
Kawaiyo!

1895
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,040
I'm scared.

1896
01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:15,800
Does it sound like it?

1897
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:16,680
Bunk, Bunk!

1898
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:17,680
Bunk!

1899
01:58:17,860 --> 01:58:18,420
Soft go!

1900
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:19,860
Shut the go- Okay, here we go.

1901
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:21,900
What weapon are we gonna get for the boss?

1902
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:23,840
Oh my god, don't jinx it!

1903
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:24,860
Don't jinx it!

1904
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:28,360
I'm dying, thank you forever.

1905
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:46,620
And...

1906
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:47,700
That was...

1907
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:51,880
That was your classic jinx, everybody.

1908
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:58,560
That was, like, the most classic jinx ever.

1909
01:59:07,010 --> 01:59:08,410
Let's go.

1910
01:59:09,370 --> 01:59:10,570
Thank you, Chiron-cha!

1911
01:59:10,950 --> 01:59:11,990
Thank you!

1912
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:16,050
It

1913
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:29,720
was down here, anyway.

1914
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:33,780
Please.

1915
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:46,580
I'm getting- I'm getting- I'm getting- I was getting
cornered.

1916
02:00:06,910 --> 02:00:09,910
Her duets with Bennett really showed her talent.

1917
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:11,450
Who's Bennett?

1918
02:00:25,380 --> 02:00:26,960
Let's this way.

1919
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:28,380
Run!

1920
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:29,360
Run!

1921
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:41,550
This way.

1922
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:58,740
I'm regressing.

1923
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:00,820
Who's Tony Bennett?

1924
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:02,440
The singer?

1925
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:04,700
What has he...

1926
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:06,680
What has he...

1927
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:08,020
Um...

1928
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:08,720
What has he done?

1929
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:10,200
Okay, this is actual LG.

1930
02:01:12,380 --> 02:01:13,140
LG!

1931
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:14,940
Oh.

1932
02:01:16,620 --> 02:01:17,380
Nice.

1933
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:21,640
LG, everybody.

1934
02:01:25,810 --> 02:01:26,330
Oh my god.

1935
02:01:27,230 --> 02:01:28,830
Unless I get eaten by the roaches.

1936
02:01:29,610 --> 02:01:30,390
I don't know.

1937
02:01:30,690 --> 02:01:31,670
Where have you been, Shuba?

1938
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:33,010
Where have you been, Shuba?

1939
02:01:33,670 --> 02:01:34,550
You were gone?

1940
02:01:34,970 --> 02:01:36,150
And then you came back?

1941
02:01:36,350 --> 02:01:37,490
And now...

1942
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:42,760
Ugh!

1943
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:44,880
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1944
02:01:46,060 --> 02:01:46,520
Ugh!

1945
02:01:53,470 --> 02:01:54,590
No Frisbee!

1946
02:01:56,150 --> 02:01:57,270
No Frisbee.

1947
02:01:58,510 --> 02:01:59,350
No Frisbee.

1948
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:01,470
No Frisbee.

1949
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:03,890
Go away Frisbee.

1950
02:02:05,110 --> 02:02:06,270
Go away Frisbee.

1951
02:02:15,930 --> 02:02:16,250
Um...

1952
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:17,170
Guys, I think I'm dead.

1953
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:19,030
I think I'm dead.

1954
02:02:21,810 --> 02:02:22,250
Or not!

1955
02:02:22,410 --> 02:02:24,510
Oh my god.

1956
02:02:25,110 --> 02:02:25,830
How I lived that?

1957
02:02:26,430 --> 02:02:26,810
I don't know.

1958
02:02:27,690 --> 02:02:28,110
I don't know.

1959
02:02:28,690 --> 02:02:29,850
I don't know how I lived that.

1960
02:02:30,590 --> 02:02:31,510
I don't know how I lived that.

1961
02:02:32,250 --> 02:02:33,050
I don't know how I lived that.

1962
02:02:33,250 --> 02:02:33,570
Godgamer.

1963
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:37,110
Godgamer.

1964
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:41,810
Don't clip any of my failures of just running into...

1965
02:02:42,510 --> 02:02:43,690
You know, normal guy.

1966
02:02:44,430 --> 02:02:45,550
Clip that one!

1967
02:02:46,110 --> 02:02:47,810
Clip me being a god gamer, okay everyone?

1968
02:02:51,010 --> 02:02:52,370
You know what?

1969
02:02:52,590 --> 02:02:53,130
That's okay.

1970
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:02,340
Don't clip that part, because running into a small guy.

1971
02:03:09,580 --> 02:03:15,380
I didn't think it was possible for ghosts to be possessed,
but I think I was possessed by ninja.

1972
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:30,720
Terrible.

1973
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:34,200
Oh, don't clip this is not here.

1974
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:35,440
No, no, no, no.

1975
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:37,000
Oh.

1976
02:03:38,820 --> 02:03:40,120
Don't, don't, don't, don't there.

1977
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:45,120
Don't, don't clip this.

1978
02:03:47,140 --> 02:03:48,060
Wait, wait, wait.

1979
02:03:48,140 --> 02:03:48,420
Hold on.

1980
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:49,440
Actually, hold on.

1981
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:54,160
Hold on.

1982
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:03,440
Let's see.

1983
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:07,520
Okay, hold on.

1984
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:09,960
Now we just need it in...

1985
02:04:11,580 --> 02:04:13,840
Put it in black and I gotta find a font.

1986
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:14,660
It's kind of similar.

1987
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:15,560
Okay, hold on.

1988
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:16,980
Let's see.

1989
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:19,820
I know I have some.

1990
02:04:25,290 --> 02:04:29,170
Quick, someone contact the devs and ask them what font they
use.

1991
02:04:31,190 --> 02:04:32,790
I'll download it.

1992
02:04:34,890 --> 02:04:36,690
Do I not have...

1993
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:40,140
8-bitty kind of font?

1994
02:04:41,300 --> 02:04:41,780
Oh,

1995
02:04:52,060 --> 02:04:52,920
I thought I had some.

1996
02:04:52,940 --> 02:04:57,560
I know I used to have some Maybe I have to re-download them

1997
02:05:03,340 --> 02:05:05,580

1999
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:17,120

2000
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,100
Are you sure?

2001
02:05:24,310 --> 02:05:24,870
Are you sure?

2002
02:05:33,730 --> 02:05:42,410
I'm hacking I'm hacking The game right now What is that
What?

2003
02:05:42,590 --> 02:05:44,250
I don't remember ever downloading that.

2004
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:50,220
What is this one?

2005
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:52,600
Oh no, it's gone!

2006
02:05:59,190 --> 02:06:01,890
Uh-oh, I think I- I think I messed up.

2007
02:06:02,070 --> 02:06:02,430
Oh, wait.

2008
02:06:04,850 --> 02:06:06,010
It's so thin.

2009
02:06:07,910 --> 02:06:09,370
She's such a skilled gamer.

2010
02:06:11,610 --> 02:06:14,870
You guys, um, I'm gonna have to ask you to avert your eyes.

2011
02:06:16,310 --> 02:06:22,010
Because, um, I'm not- Trying to give away my gaming secrets
here right now, okay?

2012
02:06:22,250 --> 02:06:23,210
I'm just saying.

2013
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:28,740
Okay.

2014
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:34,980
What do you mean by that?

2015
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:35,660
Ghost orb?

2016
02:06:37,100 --> 02:06:38,240
What do you mean by that?

2017
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:41,900
What do you mean by that?

2018
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:46,740
God gamer.

2019
02:06:58,020 --> 02:07:00,000
Literally just screen cap and crop.

2020
02:07:03,100 --> 02:07:06,840
Oh my gosh, you're so right, you're so right!

2021
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:10,400
You're so right, you're so right, you're so right!

2022
02:07:21,930 --> 02:07:23,490
Why did I think of that?

2023
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:43,250
Drum roll, please!

2024
02:08:12,750 --> 02:08:17,370

2026
02:08:20,370 --> 02:08:21,910
That's my... I promise.

2027
02:08:22,230 --> 02:08:22,450
Right?

2028
02:08:22,910 --> 02:08:24,730
Right, chat, you can vouch for me.

2029
02:08:25,590 --> 02:08:26,410
You saw that.

Chat, I'm grabbing you by your collar right now.

2032
02:08:31,510 --> 02:08:35,730
If you don't say that I didn't get 19, you better say that I
got 19 right now.

2033
02:08:39,730 --> 02:08:41,070
Is that the IQ?

2034
02:08:43,030 --> 02:08:47,670
You better tell, you better say, you got 19 and it was
really good run.

2035
02:08:47,810 --> 02:08:48,570
You better say that.

02:08:50,310 --> 02:08:51,990
It's true, I saw 19.

2037
02:08:53,150 --> 02:08:53,590
19.

2038
02:08:58,330 --> 02:09:00,030
You got 19.

Thank you.

2040
02:09:01,710 --> 02:09:03,710
She's an 11, but she's a ghost.

2041
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:14,480
Harder.

2042
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:16,300
Yeah, you know what?

2043
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:17,660
I do think we need a harder level.

2044
02:09:18,060 --> 02:09:18,780
I think you're right.

2045
02:09:20,140 --> 02:09:21,840
I think I need to be knocked down a peg.

2046
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:24,040
I think I need to only get 5.

2047
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:30,040
11 is too high for me

2048
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:36,660
Can you grab me by the neck again?

2049
02:09:36,820 --> 02:09:39,260
No, I grabbed your collar Like a bully, you know?

2050
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:41,000
It's true.

2051
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:42,480
I was the 19th.

2052
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:44,360
You know what?

2053
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:46,560
It's not about quantity.

2054
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:49,120
It's about quality, right?

2055
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:51,240
You don't want to have...

2056
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:55,240
You don't want to have 19, whatever friends.

2057
02:09:55,480 --> 02:10:06,680
You want to have 11 best friends you don't want to have 19
friends that you can't rely on 11 is the perfect number of

2058
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:27,190
friends to have then the 11 best people exactly aim for 11
there I say the consistency to get this score I give it an

2059
02:10:27,190 --> 02:10:37,050
11 out of 10 thank you thank you very much thank you thank
you useless fact in the eight on the age of empires to

2060
02:10:37,050 --> 02:10:43,550
community 11 is the way people laugh just like they'll be
you on JP chats oh I've been give I've been giggling this

2061
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:59,710
whole time okay maybe one day I will come back and have a
what's the word a revenge and with this.

2062
02:11:00,730 --> 02:11:01,790
I'll practice off stream.

2063
02:11:02,050 --> 02:11:02,910
It is so much fun, though.

2064
02:11:02,990 --> 02:11:03,930
I had a lot of fun.

2065
02:11:04,350 --> 02:11:06,170
11, 11, 11, 11, 11.

2066
02:11:07,570 --> 02:11:08,290
What does it mean?

2067
02:11:08,410 --> 02:11:09,050
Like, why, though?

2068
02:11:09,270 --> 02:11:13,410
Is it because if you say 11, it's an emote or...

2069
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:16,970
Like a laughing emote?

2070
02:11:23,050 --> 02:11:24,050
Revengeance, Metal Gear?

2071
02:11:24,170 --> 02:11:24,970
I'll be honest.

2072
02:11:26,030 --> 02:11:29,350
I forget that revengeance is not a real word sometimes.

2073
02:11:30,710 --> 02:11:32,430
I've been like...

2074
02:11:32,510 --> 02:11:37,490
I've been saying Revengeance unironically.

2075
02:11:37,610 --> 02:11:40,690
Like, I used to say it ironically, and now I say it
unironically.

2076
02:11:42,390 --> 02:11:44,450
But yeah, Tian, this is such a fun game!

2077
02:11:46,090 --> 02:11:47,270
I had so much fun.

2078
02:11:47,850 --> 02:11:49,850
And I'm going to beat my high score.

2079
02:11:50,070 --> 02:11:52,250
I'm going to get to 25.

2080
02:11:54,230 --> 02:11:55,170
That's the goal.

2081
02:11:55,850 --> 02:11:57,310
And I'm going to screenshot it.

2082
02:11:57,690 --> 02:12:02,490
And it won't be edited because you guys know I don't have
the font.

2083
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:13,710
I don't have the font for 25 damn I'm aiming high

2084
02:12:18,130 --> 02:12:26,450
Photoshop doesn't exist guys you guys I don't have the font
for 25 it's the laughter taunt in chat yes that's so funny

2085
02:12:27,750 --> 02:12:35,710
one one mine mine mine what fantasy meant Would you get
mage, et cetera?

2086
02:12:35,790 --> 02:12:36,170
Mmm.

2087
02:12:42,140 --> 02:12:43,500
Yeah, this is so much fun.

2088
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:45,320
Thank you for making a fun game.

2089
02:12:46,540 --> 02:12:47,200
And it's so cute.

2090
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:51,320
I love hearing Kodana say, I'm a dog.

2091
02:12:54,400 --> 02:13:05,630
Um, if I get fantasy outfit, I think merchant is kind of
cute, right?

2092
02:13:06,870 --> 02:13:08,330
Like a wanderer.

2093
02:13:08,510 --> 02:13:24,130
wandering trade merchant also a mage would be really cute or
like a witch with the big old witch's hat think think a

2094
02:13:24,130 --> 02:13:25,820
merchant like breasted here right

2095
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:47,030

move over to I don't know if you guys noticed but um I have

2096
02:13:47,030 --> 02:13:49,130
Corone's bones in my hair.

2097
02:13:51,870 --> 02:13:52,970
Give me a second.

2098
02:13:53,090 --> 02:13:54,250
I'm going to set up some BGM.

2099
02:13:55,330 --> 02:14:00,190
That was a good BGM, but maybe something a little more chill
to let my brain sleep out of my ears.

2100
02:14:03,470 --> 02:14:03,910
Actually, no.

2101
02:14:03,990 --> 02:14:04,610
I want this one.

2102
02:14:09,790 --> 02:14:10,230
Yeah!

2103
02:14:12,190 --> 02:14:13,030
You see him?

2104
02:14:13,150 --> 02:14:13,710
You see him?

2105
02:14:14,630 --> 02:14:16,650
I'll move this away for a second.

2106
02:14:23,970 --> 02:14:26,850
But it kind of is hard to see because of my own hair clip.

2107
02:14:30,870 --> 02:14:32,650
I stole Corone's bones.

2108
02:14:34,010 --> 02:14:35,250
Her bones are not mine.

2109
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:38,930
Yubi, yubi, as they say.

2110
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:44,490
Corone was the very first YouTuber I watched regularly, so
it was really cool.

2111
02:14:44,630 --> 02:14:52,690
see you play this yeah there's so many like cute little
references and everything so fun did she take your Yubis in

02:15:49,390 --> 02:15:50,190
It was a lot of fun.

2118
02:15:50,470 --> 02:15:50,830
Revengeance.

2119
02:15:50,970 --> 02:15:57,190
Middle English period 11 11 wait.

2120
02:15:57,750 --> 02:16:04,330
1150 to 1500 borrowed from French a furious act of revenge
to use violence to attain peace.

2121
02:16:05,030 --> 02:16:05,050
Oh.

2122
02:16:05,890 --> 02:16:06,790
Well there you go.

2123
02:16:07,290 --> 02:16:08,810
Revengeance is a real word.

2124
02:16:10,370 --> 02:16:11,050
Revengeance.

2125
02:16:11,570 --> 02:16:13,810

02:16:16,630 --> 02:16:18,630
Corone is so cute.

2128
02:16:20,490 --> 02:16:21,970
She is so, so cute.

2129
02:16:22,430 --> 02:16:22,810
Oh my gosh.

2130
02:16:22,870 --> 02:16:33,050
Did you guys see the new the new Kanatan pop-up parade that
was announced or not announced, but like went up for

2131
02:16:33,050 --> 02:16:33,890
pre-order recently.

2132
02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:35,070
Oh my gosh.

2133
02:16:35,510 --> 02:16:41,090
I keep looking at it on Ami Ami because it looks so well
made.

2134
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:45,910
It's so It's so cute

2135
02:16:49,130 --> 02:16:56,850
I'll be honest I don't watch her so much But I think her
design is like One of my favorites ever It's just this

2136
02:16:56,850 --> 02:17:09,430
cutest ever It's so Such a good design Everything about it
is so perfect I like her mama so much Her mama's art is

2137
02:17:09,430 --> 02:17:22,010
always so nice Her scale is crazy good to has so much like
the the the base and everything is so crazy yeah she has

2138
02:17:22,010 --> 02:17:29,310
some amazing outfits she does so cute so so cute i like that
i honestly this is gonna sound so weird but i i think i like

2139
02:17:29,310 --> 02:17:39,750
the pop-up parade more than her i'm looking at it right now
i think i like it more than her than the scale figure i

2140
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:48,410
think it's maybe because in the scale figure she looks like
a little but in the pop-up parade she looks cuter maybe I

2141
02:17:48,410 --> 02:17:56,730
don't know the pop-up is 10 out of 10 sometimes some pop-up
parade figures like I don't mean this like sometimes like

2142
02:17:56,730 --> 02:18:04,430
they can like get the faces well this happens with figures
quite often to be honest sometimes the faces can be a little

2143
02:18:04,430 --> 02:18:11,330
off but this one is so perfect this one's so good if I could
ever become a pop-up parade figure that would be the coolest

2144
02:18:11,330 --> 02:18:24,370
thing ever or just get a figure in general be the coolest
sometimes the pose is too simple mmm I typically like

2145
02:18:24,370 --> 02:18:34,310
figures with like cool bases or like there's the shigure ui
one where she's like sitting in the chair so it's not really

2146
02:18:34,310 --> 02:18:41,530
a base but like it just adds a little bit of extra something
like I have this one figure where it's just an original

2147
02:18:41,530 --> 02:18:47,930
character but she's coming out of a tablet let me see if i
can find a picture of it uh wait what was it called

It's really, really cool.

2164
02:20:16,370 --> 02:20:16,970
Um...

2165
02:20:16,970 --> 02:20:21,690
I don't have... When I collect figures, it's either
something like this, you know?

2166
02:20:21,990 --> 02:20:24,750
Or like a character I super duper love.

2167
02:20:24,970 --> 02:20:26,630
But I... I'll get stuff.

2168
02:20:26,750 --> 02:20:28,110
There's one figure that I...

2169
02:20:28,110 --> 02:20:29,750
I missed out on.

2170
02:20:30,590 --> 02:20:32,410
And, uh...

2171
02:20:33,090 --> 02:20:34,410
Can I get more?

2172
02:20:34,570 --> 02:20:34,990
No!

2173
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:38,790
I appreciate it though, thank you.

2174
02:20:39,910 --> 02:20:43,350
There was one figure of like a girl, oh, I found the
picture, oh my gosh.

2175
02:20:43,570 --> 02:20:45,030
How am I so good at finding these pictures?

2176
02:20:45,570 --> 02:20:46,870
She's in a box.

2177
02:20:47,810 --> 02:20:49,970
Like look at this, ah, I should have ordered it.

2178
02:20:50,110 --> 02:20:50,870
I'm such a fool.

2179
02:20:52,350 --> 02:20:53,690
Look how cool this looks.

2180
02:20:54,390 --> 02:20:58,170
Oh, I was gonna say she looks like Ray from Evangelion.

2181
02:20:58,470 --> 02:21:01,910
Like isn't it so, ah, it looks so cool.

2182
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:05,810
Like, I really like unique.

2183
02:21:07,090 --> 02:21:08,590
kind of figures like this.

2184
02:21:09,890 --> 02:21:11,010
It looks so cool.

2185
02:21:11,510 --> 02:21:12,770
It's not a cardboard box though.

2186
02:21:12,910 --> 02:21:14,750
It is not a cardboard box, no.

2187
02:21:15,370 --> 02:21:17,090
And then I ordered one recently.

2188
02:21:17,970 --> 02:21:20,210
I don't know when it comes out.

2189
02:21:23,270 --> 02:21:25,490
But it's a Yudu Camp figure.

2190
02:21:27,350 --> 02:21:29,630
It's actually technically two figures.

2191
02:21:30,390 --> 02:21:31,530
Because it's both of them.

2192
02:21:33,430 --> 02:21:34,310
And look at this.

2193
02:21:34,650 --> 02:21:35,150
Look at this.

2194
02:21:35,230 --> 02:21:35,710
Look at this.

2195
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:55,760

2199
02:22:38,940 --> 02:22:40,280
It's just made for me, I think.

2200
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:43,580
It's made for me.

2201
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:46,620
You watched Yudicamp?

2202
02:22:47,060 --> 02:22:47,400
Yes!

2203
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:49,100
Yudicamp is one of my favorite anime!

2204
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:51,500
Yes, I love Yudicamp.

2205
02:22:52,060 --> 02:22:53,600
Trying to see what else I have ordered.

2206
02:22:57,320 --> 02:22:59,420
Well, actually, I don't have that much left.

2207
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:02,940
I think that's the biggest thing I have left.

2208
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:09,440
Yes, the other stuff is like a small free-rin acrylic.

2209
02:23:10,580 --> 02:23:13,400
And, um, oh, I got this too.

2210
02:23:14,380 --> 02:23:15,360
This is really cute.

2211
02:23:16,700 --> 02:23:18,500
And it wasn't so expensive either.

2212
02:23:20,540 --> 02:23:22,460
Even though it was, I think it's, they're really small.

2213
02:23:23,740 --> 02:23:24,560
Look how cute!

2214
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:27,960
It's just little busts of the free-rin cast!

2215
02:23:29,020 --> 02:23:30,240
It's so cute!

2216
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,660
little busts of them.

2217
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:38,800
So cute.

2218
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:39,600
So cute.

2219
02:23:41,020 --> 02:23:41,920
The trio.

2220
02:23:44,100 --> 02:23:45,760
Female in shambles.

2221
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:48,080
Looks like chest pieces.

2222
02:23:48,500 --> 02:23:51,380
I think, to be honest, they might be even that small.

2223
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:53,300
But that's okay.

2224
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:57,080
It's good for like I don't know where to put them yet.

2225
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:00,240
I think I...

2226
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:01,840
Oh my gosh.

2227
02:24:01,980 --> 02:24:02,640
Oh stop.

2228
02:24:02,940 --> 02:24:04,400
I didn't notice the back.

2229
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,660
No, I'm gonna cry.

2230
02:24:07,900 --> 02:24:09,440
No, I'm gonna cry.

2231
02:24:10,120 --> 02:24:11,420
You guys, look at the back.

2232
02:24:15,740 --> 02:24:17,980
No way, I didn't notice it.

2233
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:19,520
But when I ordered it.

2234
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:20,280
What?

2235
02:24:20,420 --> 02:24:21,580
That's so cute.

2236
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:28,080
It's so...

2237
02:24:30,740 --> 02:24:31,980
I'm tearing up.

2238
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:32,800
It's so sweet.

2239
02:24:35,740 --> 02:24:37,340
that's so cute

2240
02:24:41,740 --> 02:24:51,060
figures are so expensive now you guys figures are so
expensive not to make like not only just the the shipping

2241
02:24:51,060 --> 02:25:05,080
but like the scale figures now like they used to be a
hundred and fifty dollars maybe now they're like 200 $300

2242
02:25:05,080 --> 02:25:22,300
it's crazy oh I remember when they were 80 dollars they're
so expensive now it's so so insane the ones I like are not

2243
02:25:22,300 --> 02:25:31,460
300 are they more less I can't tell what you mean by that
include shipping and it goes close to 300 luckily I say this

2244
02:25:31,460 --> 02:25:39,260
luckily not luckily but like the yen is weak right now so
that's the way i justify some things but

2245
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:56,500
no they're so pricey makes me like um like pop-up parade is
kind of a blessing with how inexpensive it is and the the

2246
02:25:56,500 --> 02:26:01,660
range too the variety of characters you can get with pop-up
parade makes it so awesome

2247
02:26:11,540 --> 02:26:23,220
but yeah nenderoys used to be 30 i know nenderoys and figmas
used to be so so much less expensive too i saw a hollow

2248
02:26:23,220 --> 02:26:29,200
figure going for 1.3k okay to be fair if if it's the pekora
one you're talking about

2249
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:40,960
I think, okay, so I'm pretty sure it's the same brand that
does these kimono like designs and it's actual fabric from

2250
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:41,880
what I understand.

2251
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:44,120
So like I under, I get it.

2252
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:50,660
Like it's actually like, you know, the quality, but it is,
it is still insane.

2253
02:26:50,900 --> 02:26:52,280
And it's also one fourth scale.

2254
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:53,920
It's one fourth scale too.

2255
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,160
It's not even like one seventh.

2256
02:26:55,440 --> 02:26:56,460
It's, it's huge.

2257
02:26:56,780 --> 02:26:58,140
It's really, really big.

2258
02:26:58,680 --> 02:26:58,900
So,

2259
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:02,160
yeah.

2260
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:11,860
it it's a lot of money but it is quite big and detailed so
i've seen because i i know because i've seen these these

2261
02:27:11,860 --> 02:27:22,360
designs multiple times they pop up pretty often on ami ami
so do you have any one-fourth scales no i don't know i

2262
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:31,960
actually i have a bigger kuro neko from oreimo but i don't
know what scale she is but she's she's a little bigger but i

2263
02:27:31,960 --> 02:27:38,820
don't think she's one-fourth or maybe

2264
02:27:44,220 --> 02:27:55,880
she is maybe she is one fourth oh she is one fourth what do
you know

2265
02:28:01,060 --> 02:28:08,040
she's one fourth so mine is one fourth and she's on her
knees so and this pekora is standing up if that gives you

2266
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:11,100
any idea of how big it's going to be.

2267
02:28:11,100 --> 02:28:12,640
Like, it's going to be really, really big.

2268
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:16,320
Yoshitoku does the fabric for the Peckle figure.

2269
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:22,780
They've made doll clothes for over 100 years, but the markup
between those anime figures and the traditional dolls is

2270
02:28:22,780 --> 02:28:23,660
massively skewed.

2271
02:28:23,820 --> 02:28:25,320
God, that makes sense.

2272
02:28:25,460 --> 02:28:33,740
I don't know if it's the same manufacturer, or the same,
like, company.

2273
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:36,520
I don't know.

2274
02:28:38,580 --> 02:28:39,720
as the other ones.

2275
02:28:39,860 --> 02:28:40,320
Let me see.

2276
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:40,840
Let me see.

2277
02:28:41,060 --> 02:28:41,460
Pekora.

2278
02:28:43,020 --> 02:28:43,820
Uh, Yoshitoku.

2279
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:45,680
Yoshitoku.

2280
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:49,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2281
02:28:49,740 --> 02:28:54,380
Okay, the Pekora one is a lot more expensive than like...

2282
02:28:54,380 --> 02:28:55,640
Okay, wait, no, that one's on sale.

2283
02:28:56,260 --> 02:28:59,300
Okay, see, here, I'm going to show you some other examples,
ones that I've seen.

2284
02:29:00,480 --> 02:29:02,320
Because she's also one-fourth scale.

2285
02:29:02,480 --> 02:29:03,780
You have...

2286
02:29:03,780 --> 02:29:09,840
I think it's really just their anime figures then, if you're
saying that the other ones are less like their actual dolls

2287
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:25,080
are less expensive because i've seen this this um made
dragon one dragon made uh this one is uh one is it's yeah uh

2288
02:29:25,080 --> 02:29:39,440
wait it's it's 157 000 yen so uh amyami says it's about a
thousand dollars and that's on sale so there's that one and

2289
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:50,760
uh let's see I haven't seen this one but I'm oh oh it's so
beautiful oh my god oh my god it's so beautiful wait is this

2290
02:29:50,760 --> 02:30:03,420
also one fourth oh yes it is oh this one's about the same
price as the as the pickle one oh my god oh look at her look

2291
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:04,940
at her oh my gosh

2292
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:10,900
She's so beautiful.

2293
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:16,960
Oh, but yeah, they do quite a bit of these.

2294
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:19,740
And they are always this pricey.

2295
02:30:19,980 --> 02:30:20,980
Every time I've seen them.

2296
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:24,780
Every time I've seen them, they're this pricey.

2297
02:30:26,480 --> 02:30:28,640
I saw the thumbnail and thought you had a collab with
Korone.

2298
02:30:30,060 --> 02:30:31,220
A lot of people thought.

2299
02:30:31,660 --> 02:30:34,380
Time zones make it hard to catch streams, but we'll support
you regardless.

2300
02:30:34,920 --> 02:30:36,520
Also, I want to mention you have a nice voice too.

2301
02:30:36,540 --> 02:30:37,600
Take care from Australia.

2302
02:30:38,700 --> 02:30:40,660
Dollhala, thank you so much.

2303
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:45,380
I'm sorry that the time zones don't line up, but I
appreciate you dropping by when you can.

2304
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:47,020
Thank you, thank you.

2305
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:49,080
Thank you so much.

2306
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:50,080
I really appreciate it.

2307
02:30:50,900 --> 02:30:53,940
When are we getting a $1,300 made mint figure?

2308
02:30:57,800 --> 02:30:58,320
Never.

2309
02:31:02,980 --> 02:31:04,880
And there's a Kizna I one too.

2310
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:06,140
It's really, it's...

2311
02:31:06,140 --> 02:31:07,980
Their figures are really, really beautiful.

2312
02:31:08,680 --> 02:31:10,220
This one's also one-fourth scale.

2313
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:12,400
Oh my gosh.

2314
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:14,940
Their figures are just really pretty.

2315
02:31:16,580 --> 02:31:20,000
If you go to Amiami and search...

2316
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:20,500
Oops.

2317
02:31:22,260 --> 02:31:23,340
And search...

2318
02:31:24,820 --> 02:31:25,360
Yoshitoku?

2319
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:27,560
Yoshitoku, you'll find them.

2320
02:31:33,080 --> 02:31:36,120
Any survey from Good Smile, I'm going to be asking for Mid.

2321
02:31:36,140 --> 02:31:42,260
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

2322
02:31:46,460 --> 02:31:46,500
no, no, no.

2323
02:31:47,100 --> 02:31:47,580
Yeah.

2324
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:51,300
Figures are so expensive.

2325
02:31:52,580 --> 02:31:58,180
These ones I, I, I know, it might be like a weird copium,
but I kind of get it.

2326
02:31:58,320 --> 02:31:59,340
Just because of the fabric.

2327
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:00,820
You think that?

2328
02:32:02,220 --> 02:32:02,880
Well, no.

2329
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:07,600
Yeah, because of the fabric and because of the scale, the
size of them.

2330
02:32:08,380 --> 02:32:09,820
It is an expensive hobby.

2331
02:32:10,040 --> 02:32:10,600
It is.

2332
02:32:11,620 --> 02:32:12,400
It is.

2333
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:14,120
It's a very expensive hobby.

2334
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:20,160
I think it's also partially why maybe I haven't gotten into
so...

2335
02:32:20,160 --> 02:32:22,480
Well, not why I haven't gotten into so many anime.

2336
02:32:22,660 --> 02:32:27,800
But, like, part of me is just like, if I get into more
things, I'll want to collect more merch from the things.

2337
02:32:27,880 --> 02:32:28,460
You know what I mean?

2338
02:32:28,860 --> 02:32:30,280
So it's just like...

2339
02:32:30,280 --> 02:32:34,260
Like, last night, right now, Sudugaya is doing free
shipping.

2340
02:32:35,420 --> 02:32:37,500
So I was looking at some Metal Gear stuff last night.

2341
02:32:38,380 --> 02:32:51,740
would still thank you for the 50 captain thank you so much
thank you thank you thank you um but uh beware warhammer

2342
02:32:51,740 --> 02:33:03,520
then um i would say that warhammer is not really my
aesthetic but well you know i like military aesthetic so

2343
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:14,240
it's not completely far off that i got into metal gear Um,
but uh, yeah, I was on Tsutugaya and I was, I was, I was

2344
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:27,320
seeing some blue archive figures that I was like, oh, I, I,
I, no, it's free shipping, but, oh, it's a pain.

2345
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:30,540
In the end, if you're wondering, I did not get anything.

2346
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:37,000
I did not get any of them, so one fourth scale, dang, almost
as tall as you.

2347
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:39,280
Ha!

2348
02:33:40,340 --> 02:33:40,620
Ha!

2349
02:33:40,940 --> 02:33:41,160
Ha!

2350
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:42,420
HAH!

2351
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:43,240
Ha!

2352
02:33:44,060 --> 02:33:44,060
HAH!

2353
02:33:44,060 --> 02:33:44,060
Ha!

2354
02:33:44,900 --> 02:33:44,900

HAH!

2356
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:47,000
That's a good one!

2357
02:33:48,200 --> 02:33:48,320
Ha!

2358
02:33:48,700 --> 02:33:49,800
Good one, Fluffy Hoots!

2359
02:33:50,300 --> 02:33:50,620
Ha!

2360
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:51,420
Ha!

2361
02:33:51,720 --> 02:33:51,880

Gamba.

2379
02:35:49,250 --> 02:35:50,150

02:35:52,050 --> 02:35:53,470
Wildest Duck, thank you again.

2382
02:35:54,370 --> 02:35:56,250
Congrats on your collab with Corone.

2383
02:35:56,790 --> 02:35:58,450
You must have given her so many UBs.

2384
02:35:58,690 --> 02:35:59,810
She's so quiet right now.

2385
02:36:00,110 --> 02:36:01,110
Can't wait for her to win.

2386
02:36:01,130 --> 02:36:02,150
she's done with them.

2387
02:36:02,550 --> 02:36:06,130
Yeah, she was just kind of... You know, you heard her the
whole time, right?

2388
02:36:06,150 --> 02:36:08,090
You heard her say Yubi-Yubi.

2389
02:36:08,530 --> 02:36:11,050
You heard her say Shotgun.

2390
02:36:12,430 --> 02:36:12,470
Hmm.

2391
02:36:13,410 --> 02:36:15,030
Being a Blue Archive fan is painful.

2392
02:36:15,130 --> 02:36:16,310
There's too many characters.

2393
02:36:17,830 --> 02:36:18,150
Yeah.

2394
02:36:19,290 --> 02:36:22,310
I have only a handful of characters that I really like,
though.

2395
02:36:23,550 --> 02:36:24,210
Just a handful.

2396
02:36:24,630 --> 02:36:27,190
And that's typically how I am with a lot of things.

2397
02:36:28,550 --> 02:36:36,770
Where if there's a ton of or something or if it's an idol
group with a ton of members or something i'll pick like just

2398
02:36:36,770 --> 02:36:39,710
a few top five

2399
02:36:44,270 --> 02:36:56,560
top five okay um hold on i'm just gonna open up blue archive
haven't logged in today anyway so it's good

2400
02:37:01,460 --> 02:37:03,800
um definitely koharu's up there They're in...

2401
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:06,100
Koharu and Cherino are like my top two.

2402
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:09,760
I love them so much.

2403
02:37:10,040 --> 02:37:11,120
Koharu and Cherino.

2404
02:37:11,460 --> 02:37:13,060
Cherino is so...

2405
02:37:13,060 --> 02:37:13,760
I love...

2406
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:14,940
She's so funny.

2407
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:15,580
I love her.

2408
02:37:17,700 --> 02:37:18,900
I love Koharu.

2409
02:37:20,020 --> 02:37:20,920
Because she's like...

2410
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:23,420
She's actually like peak character design.

2411
02:37:23,720 --> 02:37:24,000
She's...

2412
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,860
I don't know how they could get so many cute things.

2413
02:37:27,460 --> 02:37:30,660
So perfectly balanced and well in one character.

2414
02:37:31,940 --> 02:37:33,100
Just so cute.

2415
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:36,260
I think Chettino is underrated.

2416
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:39,040
But she's super duper cute.

2417
02:37:39,220 --> 02:37:39,940
She's so silly.

2418
02:37:41,340 --> 02:37:42,380
Majang Soul Stream.

2419
02:37:42,860 --> 02:37:44,100
I don't even know how to play Majang.

2420
02:37:44,660 --> 02:37:47,480
Though I did try to learn from Majang Soul before.

2421
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:49,900
Okay, let's see.

2422
02:37:50,220 --> 02:37:55,520
The screen that popped up is Onsen Chettino for me.

2423
02:37:55,640 --> 02:37:56,560
Okay, students.

2424
02:37:57,400 --> 02:37:59,500
I also really love Toki.

2425
02:38:01,220 --> 02:38:02,080
And Hina.

2426
02:38:02,320 --> 02:38:02,920
I love Hina.

2427
02:38:03,360 --> 02:38:16,940
Toki Wait, so that's Koharu, Hina, Toki Chirino, that's four
I really like Hoshino, but I wouldn't put her into my top

2428
02:38:16,940 --> 02:38:27,580
five I really like I really like Midori and Oh my gosh, why
is her sister's name blanking on me?

2429
02:38:32,650 --> 02:38:34,110
What's her sister's name?

2430
02:38:35,450 --> 02:38:35,930
Momoi!

2431
02:38:36,230 --> 02:38:37,130
Yes, oh my gosh.

2432
02:38:37,470 --> 02:38:40,950
I was just like, of course, Momoi, Momoi.

2433
02:38:41,270 --> 02:38:49,710
I was like, I feel so awful not remembering, or not,
remembering it because, um, because, uh, Momoi Haruko.

2434
02:38:50,750 --> 02:38:52,870
I always think of Momoi Haruko every time I think of Momoi.

2435
02:38:53,970 --> 02:38:55,390
Which clearly is not enough.

2436
02:38:56,110 --> 02:38:57,730
Um, I also really like Arisu.

2437
02:38:58,150 --> 02:39:00,290
I like the whole game dev team, to be honest.

2438
02:39:00,970 --> 02:39:02,770
Um, gamer cat twins are the best.

2439
02:39:02,850 --> 02:39:03,970
They're so cute.

2440
02:39:04,110 --> 02:39:07,370
Oh my gosh, the new twins that were released in JP.

2441
02:39:10,090 --> 02:39:11,770
They're so cute.

2442
02:39:12,790 --> 02:39:14,470
Problem solvers, 68 girls are great.

2443
02:39:14,710 --> 02:39:15,170
They are.

2444
02:39:16,110 --> 02:39:17,130
They are, they are.

2445
02:39:17,410 --> 02:39:19,370
I really like Aru too, but I don't have her.

2446
02:39:20,930 --> 02:39:21,950
I really love Aru.

2447
02:39:27,050 --> 02:39:28,570
Making me want to play.

2448
02:39:29,030 --> 02:39:29,130
Sorry.

2449
02:39:29,450 --> 02:39:30,910
The Blue Archive talk, everybody.

2450
02:39:31,130 --> 02:39:33,030
You can ignore it if you don't add into Blue Archive.

2451
02:39:34,890 --> 02:39:43,270
but it's like the only gotcha oh shiroko of course I have to
put in shiroko because she's voiced by my favorite seiyu

2452
02:39:43,270 --> 02:39:59,050
ogura yui she's actual tenshi ogura yui pyong pyong kudere
supremacy peace peace I also love how goofy shiroko is she's

2453
02:39:59,050 --> 02:40:06,970
so fun because she's she's she like is kudere but she's So,
so silly at the same time.

2454
02:40:07,650 --> 02:40:09,010
You're gonna love the dress Aru.

2455
02:40:11,030 --> 02:40:11,590
Thoughts on Wakamo?

2456
02:40:11,810 --> 02:40:14,410
I really like Wakamo, but I don't have her.

2457
02:40:14,890 --> 02:40:17,610
So I don't know much about her.

2458
02:40:18,590 --> 02:40:22,330
Like, well, I know, you know, I know a little, but like, you
know what I mean.

2459
02:40:23,930 --> 02:40:25,990
And, um, I also really like Saki.

2460
02:40:26,390 --> 02:40:28,750
I like the Rabbit Squad a lot because they're really cute.

2461
02:40:30,890 --> 02:40:33,270
Um, even though I only have Mo.

2462
02:40:35,730 --> 02:40:36,990
I only have...

2463
02:40:36,990 --> 02:40:38,450
Oh wait, no, I have swimsuit, Miu.

2464
02:40:39,670 --> 02:40:40,030
And...

2465
02:40:40,030 --> 02:40:41,370
Wait, I have one more too.

2466
02:40:41,590 --> 02:40:42,010
Who is it?

2467
02:40:43,510 --> 02:40:44,450
Wait, do I?

2468
02:40:46,530 --> 02:40:47,470
Oh, meyako.

2469
02:40:49,650 --> 02:40:50,610
Swimsuit, meyako.

2470
02:40:51,330 --> 02:40:51,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2471
02:40:53,990 --> 02:40:56,510
I got Wakamo swimsuit, but not regular Wakamo.

2472
02:40:56,670 --> 02:40:57,350
I don't have either.

2473
02:40:57,690 --> 02:40:59,550
I don't have that many characters, to be honest.

2474
02:41:00,090 --> 02:41:00,910
That's so sad.

2475
02:41:01,190 --> 02:41:02,390
I don't have that many characters.

2476
02:41:03,290 --> 02:41:05,310
luck in this game is so garble.

2477
02:41:07,850 --> 02:41:08,150
Yeah.

2478
02:41:09,890 --> 02:41:14,030
But out of Rabbit Squad, I like Saki the most.

2479
02:41:14,170 --> 02:41:15,090
I really like her helmet.

2480
02:41:17,650 --> 02:41:18,390
Yes, yes.

2481
02:41:19,350 --> 02:41:19,630
Yes.

2482
02:41:19,790 --> 02:41:21,770
Need to pull on stream for streamer luck.

2483
02:41:23,910 --> 02:41:24,530
We'll see.

2484
02:41:24,750 --> 02:41:27,110
I only have 9,000 jemmies.

2485
02:41:29,370 --> 02:41:31,330
So I'm not doing any pulling at the moment.

2486
02:41:32,610 --> 02:41:33,750
I am waiting.

2487
02:41:34,450 --> 02:41:35,090
Who is next?

2488
02:41:38,030 --> 02:41:38,050
Who?

2489
02:41:38,370 --> 02:41:39,190
What is...

2490
02:41:39,190 --> 02:41:39,890
Who is next?

2491
02:41:41,050 --> 02:41:42,770
New twins are called Hikari and Nozumi?

2492
02:41:43,430 --> 02:41:47,170
After the Shin... As soon as you said that, I knew the
Shin-Kansen!

2493
02:41:48,350 --> 02:41:50,270
Oh no, that makes me like them even more!

2494
02:41:52,070 --> 02:41:53,890
Wait, Railgun collab is next?

2495
02:41:54,890 --> 02:41:55,450
Oh!

2496
02:41:56,530 --> 02:41:59,630
I never got Miku, so...

2497
02:41:59,630 --> 02:42:00,030
Okay.

2498
02:42:01,590 --> 02:42:03,270
We'll save for Railgun.

2499
02:42:04,390 --> 02:42:07,290
Swimsuit Hina just came up on my screen.

2500
02:42:08,830 --> 02:42:09,230
Okay.

2501
02:42:10,290 --> 02:42:11,570

2502
02:42:12,350 --> 02:42:13,690

2515
02:42:42,670 --> 02:42:44,470

02:42:44,710 --> 02:42:44,950
No!

2517
02:42:47,510 --> 02:42:49,010
Oh my gosh, thank you for the pink dono.

2518
02:42:49,510 --> 02:42:50,930
No, no, no, no.

2519
02:42:51,490 --> 02:42:53,070
I have just the...

2520
02:42:53,070 --> 02:42:59,150
Well, the Yudokamp 1 is really expensive, so I have been
holding off on pre-ordering anything else.

2521
02:43:01,790 --> 02:43:03,110
I was like, I will.

2522
02:43:03,510 --> 02:43:04,370
I am pacing...

2523
02:43:04,750 --> 02:43:06,150
Pacing myself.

2524
02:43:07,390 --> 02:43:08,070
Oh, there it is.

2525
02:43:08,910 --> 02:43:10,510

Super chats.

We're almost to 180,000.

2535
02:43:29,710 --> 02:43:32,610
And then next 190.

2536
02:43:33,470 --> 02:43:34,670
And then maybe.

2537
02:43:34,750 --> 02:43:57,410
200 that'd be kind of crazy that'd be a little wacky if that
happened are you planning anything for 200k whoa I I didn't

2538
02:43:57,410 --> 02:44:03,530
um I didn't well I don't know I are going to get there so
fast.

2539
02:44:04,730 --> 02:44:07,050
But I didn't expect to get this far this fast.

2540
02:44:08,030 --> 02:44:11,270
So I guess I will plan something for 200k.

2541
02:44:13,370 --> 02:44:14,830
I will plan something.

2542
02:44:18,310 --> 02:44:19,810
I already have some ideas.

2543
02:44:22,290 --> 02:44:23,630
yes, yes, yes.

2544
02:44:24,030 --> 02:44:25,030
I already have some ideas.

2545
02:44:26,870 --> 02:44:31,090
And some of them, if I implement them, might take a little
bit longer.

2546
02:44:31,770 --> 02:44:34,470
So I have some time, which is good.

2547
02:44:35,190 --> 02:44:35,730
Oh my god.

2548
02:44:36,230 --> 02:44:38,010

Happy birthday!

2566
02:45:48,650 --> 02:45:54,230
I wanted to say, even though I don't have much knowledge or
understand much of anything you like, such as blue archive

2567
02:45:54,230 --> 02:45:59,730
or your feet fetishes, I do like your energy and your
passion for your hobbies.

2568
02:46:00,150 --> 02:46:02,130
Thanks for always being you for who you are.

2569
02:46:04,070 --> 02:46:06,670
Where did the feet thing come from?

2570
02:46:08,030 --> 02:46:08,850
No, it's so funny.

2571
02:46:09,030 --> 02:46:11,690
I was looking at Little Witch Nobita stuff earlier.

2572
02:46:12,990 --> 02:46:17,210
And there was this one phone stand.

2573
02:46:18,550 --> 02:46:21,110
With her feet out so much.

2574
02:46:21,910 --> 02:46:23,230
But I was like...

2575
02:46:26,330 --> 02:46:27,030
I...

2576
02:46:27,030 --> 02:46:30,930
Her toes looked like fingers.

2577
02:46:32,230 --> 02:46:33,750
It was like feet!

2578
02:46:34,110 --> 02:46:35,030
I made me feel...

2579
02:46:35,030 --> 02:46:36,350
I didn't really like it.

2580
02:46:36,470 --> 02:46:37,570
Like, I was like, oh my gosh.

2581
02:46:37,890 --> 02:46:40,870
I feel like I can smell this picture, but not in a good way.

2582
02:46:45,470 --> 02:46:48,190
Nobita has some interesting merch in Twitter posts.

2583
02:46:48,490 --> 02:46:49,030
Yes, they do.

2584
02:46:50,290 --> 02:46:51,130
If you...

2585
02:46:52,250 --> 02:46:56,830
I'm not going to put up the picture because something about
it makes me uncomfortable.

2586
02:46:57,010 --> 02:46:58,310
I don't know what it is.

2587
02:47:01,530 --> 02:47:02,210
Don't feet.

2588
02:47:02,230 --> 02:47:11,070
I'm not I'm not I'm not feet shaming I get it like I get it
if you're in defeat I get it but it's just not my thing it's

2589
02:47:11,070 --> 02:47:15,030
just not my thing it really looks like monkey toes I that's
what I'm saying

Super cute, awesome maids.

2594
02:47:40,430 --> 02:47:40,950

Hmm.

2596

2597
02:47:46,870 --> 02:47:47,730
I like it.

2598
02:47:52,390 --> 02:47:53,150
Got my scam.

2599
02:47:53,470 --> 02:47:54,110
SCAM.

2600
02:47:54,790 --> 02:47:55,010
Sorry.

2601
02:47:55,290 --> 02:47:55,910
Is it not scam?

2602
02:47:56,010 --> 02:47:56,630
Is it SCAM?

2603
02:47:57,070 --> 02:47:57,330
Sorry.

2604
02:48:00,390 --> 02:48:01,750
Prospect the hustle.

2605
02:48:02,570 --> 02:48:03,990
It sounds so legit.

2606
02:48:05,590 --> 02:48:07,930
I mean, I'm already in a maid cafe right now, as you can
see.

2607
02:48:08,790 --> 02:48:09,850
But I will consider.

2608
02:48:14,330 --> 02:48:17,850
Will there be a competitor called F-R-A-U-D?

2609
02:48:18,170 --> 02:48:18,690
Mmm.

2610
02:48:20,290 --> 02:48:23,330
Yeah, I mean, we can't have a monopoly here, right?

2611
02:48:24,510 --> 02:48:26,610
There could be S-H-A-M.

2612
02:48:28,710 --> 02:48:29,690
Cafe Sham.

2613
02:48:32,690 --> 02:48:34,930
Anyway, they are eating Mike Tyson's ass.

2614
02:48:35,170 --> 02:48:36,710
Yubi, yubi, thank you.

2615
02:48:37,430 --> 02:48:39,550
Minty Fresh Kyle, thank you.

2616
02:48:40,270 --> 02:48:42,410
Mint, if you hate us, don't say anything.

2617
02:48:44,990 --> 02:48:45,410
Oh, wait.

2618
02:48:46,030 --> 02:48:46,390
Something.

2619
02:48:46,790 --> 02:48:47,050
Oh, wait.

2620
02:48:47,870 --> 02:48:48,290
Anything.

2621
02:48:49,450 --> 02:48:49,650
Wait.

2622
02:48:50,650 --> 02:48:52,010
If you don't...

2623
02:48:52,010 --> 02:48:54,230
Wait, if you hate us...

2624
02:48:55,110 --> 02:48:56,910
Don't say anything.

2625
02:48:59,030 --> 02:49:00,550
Oh, I mixed it up.

2626
02:49:04,070 --> 02:49:08,790
I thought you meant, I thought you meant if you like us, say
anything.

2627
02:49:09,090 --> 02:49:11,970
Wait, if you hate us, say, wait.

2628
02:49:13,590 --> 02:49:13,810
Huh?

2629
02:49:16,870 --> 02:49:20,150
I thought if you don't hate us, say anything.

2630
02:49:24,590 --> 02:49:27,710
Quit your crying, quit your crying.

2631
02:49:28,370 --> 02:49:29,390
I don't want to see...

2632
02:49:30,330 --> 02:49:32,210
I don't want to see any more of these two.

2633
02:49:32,230 --> 02:49:32,730
Cheers!

2634
02:49:33,230 --> 02:49:34,330
Quit your crying!

2635
02:49:42,950 --> 02:49:46,820
Quit your crying!

2636
02:49:47,720 --> 02:49:47,780
Quit your crying.

2637
02:49:47,780 --> 02:49:48,560
Ego Josu.

2638
02:49:52,040 --> 02:49:52,100
Yeah?

2639
02:49:52,780 --> 02:49:53,940
What about it?

2640
02:49:57,220 --> 02:49:58,420
Quit your crying.

2641
02:49:59,900 --> 02:50:00,960
Quit your crying.

2642
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:03,580
This is the real world.

2643
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:07,860
This is what you will hear on a daily basis.

2644
02:50:08,400 --> 02:50:11,300
Someone will walk up to you on the street and they'll say,
Hey, I hate you.

2645
02:50:12,420 --> 02:50:14,300
That's just the reality of things.

2646
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:15,880
You gotta be tough.

2647
02:50:16,320 --> 02:50:18,960
You gotta be a tough cookie out there.

2648
02:50:25,810 --> 02:50:26,610
It's true.

2649
02:50:31,510 --> 02:50:32,650
That's messed up.

2650
02:50:35,170 --> 02:50:36,490
That's just how life is, man.

2651
02:50:39,530 --> 02:50:42,930
Here to gauge your interest in my venture, the freaking
rad...

2652
02:50:44,710 --> 02:50:44,870
Oh!

2653
02:50:47,090 --> 02:50:49,610
Awesome, ultra delicious cafe.

2654
02:50:50,430 --> 02:50:52,510
F-R-A-U-D for short!

2655
02:50:54,230 --> 02:50:54,750
Competition.

2656
02:50:55,470 --> 02:50:57,010
Oh my gosh, I'm getting too many offers, you guys.

2657
02:50:57,550 --> 02:50:59,970
Please, please, please respect my boundaries.

2658
02:51:01,050 --> 02:51:02,290
Send it to my email.

2659
02:51:03,530 --> 02:51:05,710
Send it to my manager, aka me.

2660
02:51:07,050 --> 02:51:08,250
Why do you make us cry?

2661
02:51:08,930 --> 02:51:10,290
Stop telling me what to do, VTuber.

2662
02:51:14,410 --> 02:51:14,810
Fine.

2663
02:51:16,510 --> 02:51:17,650
I won't tell you twice.

2664
02:51:19,410 --> 02:51:20,870
Pre-order bonus, thank you!

2665
02:51:21,010 --> 02:51:22,650
For the 10, thank you so much!

2666
02:51:24,830 --> 02:51:25,970
Mint, get a manager.

2667
02:51:26,150 --> 02:51:27,810
Okay, but you make it sound so easy!

2668
02:51:29,350 --> 02:51:30,630
You make it sound so easy!

2669
02:51:34,970 --> 02:51:35,770
Like... like...

2670
02:51:35,770 --> 02:51:38,070
How does one just acquire a manager?

2671
02:51:38,490 --> 02:51:39,790
I have to find someone...

2672
02:51:40,390 --> 02:51:41,110
I don't know anybody.

2673
02:51:41,530 --> 02:51:49,690
Second of all, I have to find someone that's not gonna steal
all my information and run away like a Looney Tunes villain,

2674
02:51:49,770 --> 02:51:50,570
okay?

2675
02:51:53,070 --> 02:51:55,430
The afterlife is hard, okay?

2676
02:52:00,010 --> 02:52:01,470
Ask Mr. Mayan.

2677
02:52:02,470 --> 02:52:03,890
Just call Mr. Mayan.

2678
02:52:04,190 --> 02:52:06,010
Why is...

2679
02:52:08,310 --> 02:52:09,810
The manager's store.

2680
02:52:10,390 --> 02:52:11,830
I'm gonna go to a vending machine.

2681
02:52:12,850 --> 02:52:14,210
Manager vending machine.

2682
02:52:15,330 --> 02:52:16,470

2683
02:52:16,910 --> 02:52:18,190

02:52:21,410 --> 02:52:21,610
Hmm?

2686
02:52:26,550 --> 02:52:27,150
It's...

2687
02:52:27,150 --> 02:52:30,130
I feel disturbance in the floors.

2688
02:52:31,330 --> 02:52:32,350
Minty Fresh Kyle, thank you!

2689
02:52:32,630 --> 02:52:34,010
Minty Fresh Kyle, thank you again!

02:52:47,450 --> 02:52:49,510
All glory to the dog god.

2693
02:52:53,290 --> 02:52:55,330
The chatbots are out of hand.

2694
02:52:55,830 --> 02:52:58,230
YouTube GPT chatbot version 1.51.

2695
02:52:58,530 --> 02:53:00,410
I wonder what he'll say in version 1.52.

2696
02:53:02,870 --> 02:53:04,410
Dog I am.

2697
02:53:04,750 --> 02:53:07,290
Wait, are you a chatbot or are you a dog?

2698
02:53:07,930 --> 02:53:09,450
Who gave this dog?

2699
02:53:09,770 --> 02:53:11,270
Who gave this dog a keyboard?

2700
02:53:12,170 --> 02:53:13,270

2707
02:54:16,680 --> 02:54:23,820
always say legend legend every time he comes up and so I
actually I showed them, I showed them the clip of Korone

2708
02:54:23,820 --> 02:54:26,580
saying your name and her just going, no!

2709
02:54:31,860 --> 02:54:34,400
So I watched it again recently.

2710
02:54:39,080 --> 02:54:40,440
So, yeah.

2711
02:54:41,060 --> 02:54:43,440
Fancy seeing you, fancy seeing you.

2712
02:54:44,640 --> 02:54:46,280
Thanks for dropping by so often.

2713
02:54:47,960 --> 02:54:49,920
Evans Kazoo covers, thank you.

2714
02:54:51,100 --> 02:54:51,500
too?

2715
02:54:54,460 --> 02:54:56,980
Not enough chief.

2716
02:54:59,400 --> 02:55:00,860
Second soul, thank you.

2717
02:55:05,460 --> 02:55:07,620
Did you play Death Must Die?

2718
02:55:07,700 --> 02:55:08,620
Matara liked it a lot.

2719
02:55:08,780 --> 02:55:09,180
I have not.

2720
02:55:10,920 --> 02:55:11,960
Also, thank you.

2721
02:55:13,120 --> 02:55:16,340
I'm listening while halfway through a six to seven mile walk
and regretting it.

2722
02:55:16,600 --> 02:55:18,920
Regretting the stream or regretting the walk.

2723
02:55:23,100 --> 02:55:24,140
Which one?

2724
02:55:28,580 --> 02:55:30,820
Which one are you regretting?

2725
02:55:34,040 --> 02:55:36,060
Hey, Mint, you seem super into Metal Gear.

2726
02:55:36,420 --> 02:55:38,360
We all know the real reason to play MGS though.

2727
02:55:38,460 --> 02:55:39,100
For shipping!

2728
02:55:40,380 --> 02:55:42,940
Who's your favorite pair and who's your favorite rare pair?

2729
02:55:44,260 --> 02:55:46,520
Favorite pair is Big Boss and Ocelot.

2730
02:55:47,700 --> 02:55:48,580
Rare pair.

2731
02:55:51,100 --> 02:56:04,800
Rare pair Rare pair Rare pair Rare pair Rare pair

2732
02:56:09,580 --> 02:56:21,460
Dirty pair Rare pair Rare pair Rare pair

2733
02:56:25,940 --> 02:56:27,180
Hmm.

2734
02:56:28,580 --> 02:56:29,440
Rare pair.

2735
02:56:33,620 --> 02:56:36,340
Miller Naomi.

2736
02:56:37,900 --> 02:56:38,240
No.

2737
02:56:39,360 --> 02:56:41,540
They don't even know each other.

2738
02:56:45,080 --> 02:56:46,260
Rare pair.

2739
02:56:47,120 --> 02:56:47,260
Oh.

2740
02:56:48,300 --> 02:56:49,820
Obviously, vamp and Naomi.

2741
02:56:55,460 --> 02:56:58,840
Um, uh, Vamp and Naomi.

2742
02:56:59,480 --> 02:57:00,620
Great couple.

2743
02:57:01,420 --> 02:57:02,880
My favorite rare pair.

2744
02:57:05,420 --> 02:57:05,820
Ew.

2745
02:57:09,660 --> 02:57:10,420
Yuck.

2746
02:57:12,680 --> 02:57:14,300
I was choked on my drink.

2747
02:57:16,500 --> 02:57:18,440
Vamp and Riot and you mean.

2748
02:57:19,920 --> 02:57:20,920
What are you talking about?

2749
02:57:22,540 --> 02:57:24,360
It's the best rare pair.

2750
02:57:25,660 --> 02:57:27,500
Um, Riko, thank you!

2751
02:57:27,900 --> 02:57:29,540
I'm glad you're enjoying your Hell Divers training.

2752
02:57:30,120 --> 02:57:33,980
Actually, um, Mataro is trying to organize a Hell Divers
collab.

2753
02:57:35,300 --> 02:57:37,120
Because I've been wanting to play it.

2754
02:57:37,500 --> 02:57:38,400
So yeah, good training.

2755
02:57:38,800 --> 02:57:40,580
I know that I will be so useful.

2756
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:45,240
Oh, actually, I should play MGS 5 again.

2757
02:57:47,060 --> 02:57:48,660
So for actual training.

2758
02:57:49,380 --> 02:57:51,440
Hey, MF, it's Piccolo again.

2759
02:57:51,660 --> 02:57:52,740
Dirty pair of what?

2760
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:56,700
Dirty pair of socks.

2761
02:57:56,920 --> 02:57:57,720
Wash your socks, everybody.

2762
02:57:58,440 --> 02:57:59,500

Bravery Duck, thank you.

2766
02:58:04,560 --> 02:58:06,660
This game really makes you feel like Toho.

2767
02:58:08,780 --> 02:58:09,860
Oh, I felt the Toho.

2768
02:58:10,560 --> 02:58:11,520
Murphy, Dog.

2769
02:58:11,900 --> 02:58:12,380

I just realized the time.

2782
02:59:04,780 --> 02:59:05,580
You guys, I gotta put it together.

2783
02:59:05,780 --> 02:59:06,220
My desk.

2784
02:59:07,120 --> 02:59:09,040
I mean, my furniture.

2785
02:59:11,120 --> 02:59:12,660
So let's say I'm happy to see you back again.

2786
02:59:12,800 --> 02:59:13,500
I've loved every stream.

2787
02:59:13,800 --> 02:59:16,080
I don't talk much in chat, but every stream has been so much
fun.

2788
02:59:16,320 --> 02:59:17,800
Aww, thank you.

2789
02:59:18,620 --> 02:59:19,880
Happy to be back.

2790
02:59:21,420 --> 02:59:23,680
Have a lot of fun every day, so thank you guys.

2791
02:59:26,280 --> 02:59:28,280
That's such an awesome name.

2792
02:59:29,440 --> 02:59:31,420
It sucks you have to be the second one, though.

2793
02:59:35,280 --> 02:59:36,700
Shelf-building stream.

Hello, connoisseur, thank you.

2818
03:00:18,020 --> 03:00:20,520
Sorry, I was making sure I said your, did I say your name
right?

2819
03:00:20,600 --> 03:00:21,260
I hope so.

2820
03:00:22,780 --> 03:00:29,060
And it meant if you don't hate us, don't say, Wait, if you
don't hate us...

2821
03:00:29,060 --> 03:00:29,980
Wait, oh no!

2822
03:00:36,130 --> 03:00:36,690
Um...

2823
03:00:39,630 --> 03:00:40,190
Flash...

2824
03:00:40,190 --> 03:00:40,810
Message.

2825
03:00:42,930 --> 03:00:43,670
You're welcome.

2826
03:00:46,630 --> 03:00:50,270
Speaking of figures, I recently got my Miku 15th anniversary
shortcake figure.

2827
03:00:50,810 --> 03:00:51,510
It's so cute.

2828
03:00:51,870 --> 03:00:53,510
Wait, I don't know if I've seen that one before.

2829
03:00:55,030 --> 03:00:55,650
Oh, oh.

2830
03:00:58,570 --> 03:01:00,410
Oh my god, it's beautiful.

2831
03:01:01,530 --> 03:01:03,350
Oh my gosh, it's beautiful.

2832
03:01:06,050 --> 03:01:07,770
It's so pretty.

2833
03:01:07,930 --> 03:01:09,810
Oh my god, the base is a plate.

2834
03:01:11,130 --> 03:01:12,290
It's so pretty.

2835
03:01:13,810 --> 03:01:15,110
What scale is she?

2836
03:01:15,730 --> 03:01:17,490
Oh my god, the price on it.

2837
03:01:17,730 --> 03:01:18,710
Wait, the price.

2838
03:01:19,210 --> 03:01:20,170
What scale is she?

2839
03:01:22,250 --> 03:01:22,970
One seventh.

2840
03:01:27,030 --> 03:01:27,510
Sheesh.

2841
03:01:29,390 --> 03:01:30,630
She is so cute.

2842
03:01:30,850 --> 03:01:31,230
Oh my gosh.

2843
03:01:31,390 --> 03:01:34,590
The macaron too is so... Everything is so cute.

2844
03:01:35,770 --> 03:01:37,810
Minto-chan-kyo-mo-kawaii.

2845
03:01:41,030 --> 03:01:42,370
Yeah, you guys, I said it.

2846
03:01:42,470 --> 03:01:43,870
It means I don't hate you guys.

2847
03:01:43,950 --> 03:01:45,030
Stop crying.

2848
03:01:48,070 --> 03:01:48,950
Stop crying.

2849
03:01:49,170 --> 03:01:50,530
I should unprivate, though.

2850
03:01:50,990 --> 03:01:55,350
I don't think I had the flash message on my...

2851
03:01:55,350 --> 03:01:57,150
You know, I had a tongue twister video.

2852
03:01:57,550 --> 03:01:58,250
I should unprivate.

2853
03:01:58,270 --> 03:02:06,830
it it's kind of cringe here like hearing me from so long ago
she hates us

2854
03:02:10,270 --> 03:02:17,790
love seeing different games hope you keep having a lot of
fun with them replay tokyo jungle after you mention it i

2855
03:02:17,790 --> 03:02:24,730
should play tokyo jungle should i should i should i could
play whatever i want that's the craziest that's the craziest

2856
03:02:24,730 --> 03:02:35,930
thing is if there's something i want to play comes out i
could play it i could play whatever i want whatever actually

2857
03:02:35,930 --> 03:02:45,010
that's a lie there are some things that i will stay away
from that i kind of want to play but i won't because i'm

2858
03:02:45,010 --> 03:02:56,630
scared of nintendo like if it's like a pokemon mod i won't i
probably won't play it because i've seen that a lot of

2859
03:02:56,630 --> 03:02:58,830
channels have been getting struck.

2860
03:02:59,110 --> 03:02:59,570
Choo!

2861
03:03:02,470 --> 03:03:06,550
I've heard other VTuber complaining that there's actually
too little MGS fanfiction.

2862
03:03:07,110 --> 03:03:07,750
Is this true?

2863
03:03:08,110 --> 03:03:09,390
I don't read fanfiction.

2864
03:03:09,950 --> 03:03:14,090
But I have talked about this with a friend where we were
like...

2865
03:03:14,090 --> 03:03:15,530
We were like...

2866
03:03:15,530 --> 03:03:21,390
When the Master Collection comes out, maybe all the girlies
will be like, Yes, this is it.

2867
03:03:21,470 --> 03:03:22,350
This is the game.

2868
03:03:22,450 --> 03:03:23,370
This is the series.

2869
03:03:23,770 --> 03:03:25,430
And there will be so much more Dojin.

2870
03:03:25,970 --> 03:03:32,690
But, unfortunately, it hasn't, it hasn't, at least from what
I've noticed, it hasn't changed much.

2871
03:03:34,970 --> 03:03:37,350
So, like, I went to Comic-Cit last year.

2872
03:03:38,070 --> 03:03:39,210
I went to Winter Comic-Cit.

2873
03:03:40,850 --> 03:03:45,070
And, um, there was only a few tables with MGS Dogein.

2874
03:03:45,530 --> 03:03:50,330
And they were all, they were all, like, from five, so it was
a little disappointing.

2875
03:03:52,150 --> 03:03:53,970
So sad, so sad, so sad.

2876
03:03:58,630 --> 03:04:00,590
Um, limo limo, thank you!

2877
03:04:01,630 --> 03:04:04,570
Thank you for all the gifted donors, or gifted memberships.

2878

Greetings from another German wisp.

2940
03:06:52,440 --> 03:06:54,560
Is that why I can't say your name right?

2941
03:06:59,080 --> 03:07:00,260
Let me see you later.

2942
03:07:00,460 --> 03:07:02,020

2956
03:07:24,060 --> 03:07:25,900
I think I may have stolen some of your luck.

2957
03:07:26,120 --> 03:07:30,520
I was playing a similar game, Kill the Crows, while
listening, and got six unlocks in ten minutes.

2958
03:07:30,920 --> 03:07:32,080
Gomen Nassai.

I forgive you.

2961
03:07:40,860 --> 03:07:42,860
Actually, I don't forgive you.

2962
03:07:45,620 --> 03:07:46,540
I don't forgive you.

2963
03:07:48,720 --> 03:07:49,800
I'm going to haunt you.

2964
03:07:51,280 --> 03:07:54,700
I'm going to haunt you until you give me my luck back.

2965
03:08:19,620 --> 03:08:20,620
That was weird.

2966
03:08:22,380 --> 03:08:23,020
What was happening?

2967
03:08:23,660 --> 03:08:25,400

A little.

3009
03:09:34,480 --> 03:09:39,440
When you least expect a possession, it will arrive.

03:09:40,140 --> 03:09:41,760

Egotistical woman.

Does that count as a rare pair?

3029
03:10:54,540 --> 03:10:57,140
Maybe because I don't think many people ship them.

3030
03:10:57,140 --> 03:11:00,890
I don't think many people ship them.

3031
