1
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,510
In my time...

2
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,110
In my time...

3
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,550
Sorry, I forgot it was completely playing.

4
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,230
In

5
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:41,700
my time...

6
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,160
Here, I'll start.

7
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,260
We'll listen to it in its entirety.

8
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,240
Once it...

9
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,060
restarts.

10
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,640
Welcome back!

11
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,280
Welcome back to Metal Gear Solid 3.

12
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,220
Subsistence.

13
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,460
Last time I left off, we had just met Eva.

14
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,460
And... my game froze.

15
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,500
But my save seems to be...

16
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,540
okay.

17
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Last I checked.

18
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,620
So...

19
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,320
Um...

20
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,420
Yeah, I'm ready to go...

21
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,060
for it.

22
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,000
And...

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,020
So yeah, I'll make multiple saves this time.

24
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,520
Yeah.

25
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,240
The save is saved.

26
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,140
Thanks to...

27
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,500
No one.

28
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,740
This is not... nope.

29
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,780
No one gets the credit.

30
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,220
Did you press R1?

31
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,900
Absolutely.

32
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,380
Yeah, Eva's just too sexy.

33
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,920
My...

34
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,700
My PS2, like...

35
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,940
crumpled under her, you know?

36
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,560
Happy first day of fall!

37
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,240
Oh my gosh!

38
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,220
First day of fall...

39
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,500
You guys can hear it, by the way, right?

40
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,480
What is this?

41
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,740
What a thrill...

42
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm searching, and I'll melt into you...

43
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,460
What a fear in my heart...

44
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,920
But you're so supreme...

45
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,680
I give my life...

46
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,500
Not for honor, but...

47
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,600
The way it shows, um...

48
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,240
In my time...

49
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,280
There'll be no one

50
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,280
else...

51
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,140
Crime...

52
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,920
Is the way...

53
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,660
I fly to you...

54
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,820
I'm still...

55
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,700
In a dream...

56
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,580
Snake eater...

57
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,400
Love...

58
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,380
Someday...

59
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,860
You go...

60
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,300
Through the rain...

61
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,520
And someday...

62
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,360
What do you feed on?

63
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,140
On a tree...

64
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,980
A tree frog!

65
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,020
It's ordeal...

66
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,740
The trial...

67
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,480
To survive...

68
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,580
For the day...

69
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,280
We see new light...

70
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,440
I give my life...

71
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,300
Not for honor, but for...

72
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,580
Snake eater...

73
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,780
In my time...

74
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,140
Time...

75
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,060
There'll be no one else...

76
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,430
Crime...

77
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,550
Is the way...

78
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,530
I fly to you...

79
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,010
I'm still...

80
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,850
In a dream...

81
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,470
Snake eater...

82
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,430
I'm still...

83
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,990
In a dream...

84
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,010
Snake eater...

85
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,220
Daga...

86
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,140
Dang it, I didn't get the sneeter.

87
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,040
I'll keep trying for the sneeter.

88
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,240
Okay, that was good.

89
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,120
That was good.

90
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,760
Good warm-up session everybody.

91
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,500
Now we're orange.

92
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,580
Before it was pink.

93
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,360
It was so cute.

94
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,660
Best game track so... this is too good.

95
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,740
All Metal Gear songs are just... they're just too good.

96
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,480
I'm gonna press the start button so it doesn't replay because then we'll have to do it all over again.

97
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,380
Yeah.

98
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,660
Sorry if you're watching live, which is right now.

99
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,120
Hello.

100
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,180
Hello.

101
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,620
If you're watching the VOD, maybe this doesn't really pertain to you.

102
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:55,780
But I wanted to apologize because I was supposed to play this on Saturday.

103
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,420
Now I'm playing it on Sunday.

104
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,480
So it's Metal Gear Sunday instead of Saturday.

105
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,860
I'm so sorry for that.

106
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,360
VOD watches skip 10 minutes possibly.

107
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:04,600
What?

108
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,900
You don't want to hear me yop!

109
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,120
I wasn't feeling so hot yesterday.

110
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,320
When I woke up, I was like...

111
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,380
But I'm feeling good now.

112
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,660
Actually, I think it was like so much stress.

113
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,320
I haven't been able to sleep very well recently because I've been like...

114
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,420
My brain has been just like... going and going.

115
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,960
I put on YouTube videos when I'm trying to fall asleep.

116
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,840
And last night I had on National Geographic.

117
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,520
Sorry.

118
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,380
No, not last night.

119
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,160
The night before last.

120
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,900
And it was like... What was it about?

121
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,120
It was about some ship that they were trying to scuba dive and find.

122
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,380
But I couldn't even pay attention to them the whole time.

123
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,760
I was like thinking in my brain.

124
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,700
My brain was thinking and I didn't like that.

125
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,040
No monkey.

126
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,420
No monkey.

127
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,300
As a VOD watcher from the future, I'm terribly disappointed.

128
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,240
But...

129
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,380
Yeah, so...

130
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,460
I had to...

131
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,360
I had to...

132
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
I was like...

133
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,260
I woke up and I was like...

134
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,240
I didn't get like any sleep.

135
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,500
I fell asleep basically around like...

136
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,760
Around like 5 a.m.

137
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,180
or something.

138
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,980
And I was like...

139
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,060
I'm so...

140
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,720
But I woke up yesterday.

141
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,740
I wasn't feeling so good.

142
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,700
And then I felt better more towards like the later afternoon.

143
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,160
And so I did basically all the things that I was up...

144
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,240
Last night.

145
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,380
Or the night before.

146
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,040
Stressing about.

147
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,300
So I feel...

148
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,120
Much better.

149
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,700
Yeah.

150
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,900
Couldn't have watched it yesterday.

151
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,300
So I'm glad you changed it to today.

152
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:38,780
Oh!

153
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,220
Yay!

154
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,740
Welcome back, Nexi.

155
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,300
Thank you.

156
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,680
I'm glad...

157
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,280
Or rather, I'm glad that it...

158
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,300
Worked out.

159
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,280
Let's see.

160
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,220
So...

161
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:49,760
Cool.

162
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,840
You recently mentioned the planetarium cafe and the haunted airport my friend and I stumbled upon a month ago.

163
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,840
I saw a short film about black holes...

164
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,320
Wait!

165
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,220
I saw that one too!

166
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,840
It was super cool.

167
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,320
But all Japanese so I was just not...

168
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,960
Yeah!

169
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,780
I saw the black hole one also!

170
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,840
Wait, maybe they...

172
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,440
I wonder how often they change it out.

173
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,560
Maybe per season, right?

174
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,200
So...

175
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,160
Black hole what?

176
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,740
It's like a...

177
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,220
It's like...

178
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,120
About...

179
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,000
Um...

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,640
Some Japanese researcher that...

181
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,180
Like...

182
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,900
Discovered...

183
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,840
Oh, what was it?

184
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,140
Uh...

185
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,280
Uh...

186
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,080
Discovered...

187
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,640
Something about black holes.

188
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:29,820
I don't know.

189
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:29,840
It was...

190
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,820
It was like a...

191
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,780
Just...

192
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,540
I don't remember.

193
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,010
No.

194
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,210
Need more snake.

195
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,810
Nah, we got more snake coming.

196
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,870
Don't worry about it.

197
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:50,730
Discovered...

198
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:51,970
Some...

199
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,850
Thing.

200
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,330
Discovered...

201
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,070
Something.

202
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,550
Thanks for making spinal surgery with me.

203
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,150
Recovery more fun.

204
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:02,610
Oh my gosh.

205
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:02,870
Wait.

206
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,070
Actually...

207
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,630
Oh my gosh.

208
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,210
Please.

209
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:05,870
Get better soon.

210
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,150
I thought you were making that joke.

211
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,030
Where it's just like...

212
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,630
Hi, Minto.

213
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,570
Thank you for...

214
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,270
Uh...

215
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,410
Saving me from that car wreckage.

216
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,910
You...

217
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,230
Lifted the car with what...

218
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,390
You know how people make that meme?

219
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,110
Oh my gosh.

220
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,050
I thought...

221
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,490
I thought you were like...

222
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,250
Kidding about it.

223
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,330
Um...

224
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:21,750
Hold on.

225
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,290
One second.

226
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,310
Let me...

227
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,740
Uh...

228
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,280
Um...

229
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,700
One second.

230
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,800
My mom texted me.

231
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,500
Um...

232
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,920
She wants to make plans with me.

233
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,380
Plans?

234
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,520
Outside?

235
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,380
Uh...

236
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,320
She wants to go to like an art exhibit.

237
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,980
Which actually sounds kind of awesome.

238
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,780
So...

239
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,620
Not the plans.

240
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,980
Kind of sounds awesome.

241
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,600
But yeah.

242
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,060
So...

243
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,860
Last time...

244
00:11:59,560 --> 00:11:59,840
We...

245
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,480
Um...

246
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,180
We...

247
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,880
Uh...

248
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,800
Met Eva.

249
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,840
But then my game crashed.

250
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,000
So...

251
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,600
Um...

252
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,520
Yeah.

253
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,440
We're gonna load.

254
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,280
And it should be okay.

255
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,840
I think it's still like mid cut scene.

256
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,820
We just fell asleep.

257
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,260
Right?

258
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,920
And then...

259
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,220
And then I tried to save.

260
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,320
And then it was just like...

261
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,540
Nah.

262
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,700
But...

263
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,120
I...

264
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,880
I also...

265
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,520
One other thing.

266
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,220
I also...

267
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:23,760
Um...

268
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,320
I...

269
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,440
Updated the clock.

270
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,460
So...

271
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,300
Hopefully...

272
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,320
It's okay.

273
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,860
Did you give your BS?

274
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,520
Do a massage?

275
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,380
So it works better?

276
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:34,840
No.

277
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,780
I took out the...

278
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,580
Memory...

279
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,060
Um...

280
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,720
The memory card.

281
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,380
And I went...

282
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,620
All over it.

283
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,600
Um...

284
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,000
You know?

285
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,260
So...

286
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:48,960
Yeah.

287
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,360
I...

288
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,680
Ready to catch you live.

289
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,460
Also feel better soon.

290
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Spinal surgery, bro.

291
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,100
I'm in bed after having my scoliosis corrected.

292
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,420
What?

293
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,560
Oh my gosh.

294
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,680
Everybody with their backs.

295
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,520
Oh my gosh.

296
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,020
My ectoplasm is also kind of whack though.

297
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,580
So...

298
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,140
I get you.

299
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,400
Do you have any questions?

300
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,620
Do you remember the basics of CQC?

301
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,480
Yeah.

302
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,300
Blowing on it works.

303
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:18,820
Murphy.

304
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,400
I was kidding.

305
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,080
Murphy.

306
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,500
Murphy.

307
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,060
Murphy.

308
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,420
I wasn't serious.

309
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,460
Oh my gosh.

310
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,650
You would do it.

311
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:37,830
No!

312
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,450
I'm...

313
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,010
I'm smarter than that.

314
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,530
I'm smarter than that.

315
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,250
I know that when you blow on the...

316
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:44,750
Oh my gosh.

317
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,170
On the...

318
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:45,730
What's it called?

319
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,190
It...

320
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,550
On the memory cards.

321
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,330
It causes the moisture.

322
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,630
I know that.

323
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,450
I know that.

324
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:55,570
Wisps.

325
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,270
Is she smart?

326
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,370
Chat.

327
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,390
Is this real?

328
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,170
Okay.

329
00:13:59,210 --> 00:13:59,750
Let's start.

330
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,010
Actually, when I blow on them, I go...

331
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,130
That's what I do instead.

332
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,310
Make sure it's nice and...

333
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,370
Nice and...

334
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,470
Damp in there.

335
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:13,830
You know?

336
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:14,370
Okay.

337
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:14,730
Okay.

338
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,730
Thank you for blowing on my memory card and recovering my PS2's memory for me that one time.

339
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,770
Really saved my bacon.

340
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,940
Nice technique.

341
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,480
Thank you.

342
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,360
That's right.

343
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,560
Eva.

344
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,120
I'm holding R1.

345
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,700
I'm holding R1.

346
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,560
She's doing sussy business.

347
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:00,810
Oh!

348
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,610
Oh!

349
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,670
Oh!

350
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:03,430
Oh!

351
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,830
Oh!

352
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,750
If any children are in the chat, which I know there are, you better look away, buddy.

353
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:13,970
What's the matter?

354
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,550
We're surrounded.

355
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,250
No!

356
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,370
I see.

357
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,490
Four of them.

358
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,790
I don't know if that's surrounded.

359
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,150
R1.

360
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:25,970
R1.

361
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,970
You did a little peek.

362
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,590
We got company.

363
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,690
It's the ocelot unit.

364
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,550
Let's get out of here.

365
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:30,870
Hurry.

366
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,670
Don't forget your gear.

367
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,570
I got my gear.

368
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,750
Here.

369
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,890
Give me a hand.

370
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,270
I'm gonna go under the bed.

371
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,530
No, Eva.

372
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,090
You're supposed to sleep on top of the bed.

373
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,530
What an angle.

374
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,350
I know.

375
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,330
Eva's so hot.

376
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,050
This is not a basement.

377
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,990
This is a crawl space.

378
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:04,890
Ocelot.

379
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,310
He's so obsessed with me.

380
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,750
I think my...

381
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,650
What's it called, though?

382
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,010
My...

383
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,750
Don't go dying on me now.

384
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,720
I think all my food will be expired, though, since I changed my clock.

385
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,060
So, we'll see, I guess.

386
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,640
Did you do the thing to ocelot?

387
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,260
Of course.

388
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,480
I did a lot of stuff to ocelot.

389
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,420
Oh, wait.

390
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,600
Is this where I'm supposed to go?

391
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,200
Is this where I defeat them?

392
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,400
Oh, yeah.

393
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,620
This is where I have to, like, take them out, though, right?

394
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,520
Move.

395
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,600
Oh, shoot.

396
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,520
I forgot about this part.

397
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:58,840
Two.

398
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,860
Thank you.

399
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,080
A wooga wooga.

400
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,640
Respectfully.

401
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:04,820
Oh.

402
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,760
What are they doing?

403
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:08,780
Ah!

404
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:11,820
Move.

405
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:12,880
Move.

406
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,280
Oh, my gosh.

407
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,640
Okay.

408
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,000
Wait.

409
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,960
Oh, let me check on my food.

410
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,320
Oh, my gosh.

411
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,480
Okay.

412
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,020
Let's see if it's all rotten.

413
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,620
Oh!

414
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,440
It's okay!

415
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's a miracle!

416
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,960
It's a miracle!

417
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,240
All my food is good!

418
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:41,840
Wow.

419
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,640
It's rotten.

420
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:46,820
Wait.

421
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,440
How can you tell?

422
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,760
Oh!

423
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,740
Oh.

424
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
I see the flies.

425
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,980
Never mind.

426
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,980
What do I...

427
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,300
Oh!

428
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,120
I mean...

429
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,480
I see them now.

430
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,520
What about my cal...

431
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,400
My calorie rate's fine.

432
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,460
It's okay.

433
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,200
We'll just get more reticulated python.

434
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,400
You sure you want to eat that?

435
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,700
It says it's fairly tasty.

436
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,020
I mean...

437
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,480
What if...

438
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,020
Oh, my gosh.

439
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,420
If the...

440
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,200
You know...

441
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,420
I bet...

442
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,240
If...

443
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,480
Okay.

444
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,020
Imagine...

445
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,300
If the...

446
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,020
If the PS2 controller had a microphone on it.

447
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,620
And then you could blow the flies off.

448
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,760
You just go...

449
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,480
Can you just imagine?

450
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,640
Finish the podcast and did you ever make the s'mores?

451
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,200
No.

452
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,900
Five second rule.

453
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,220
Yeah.

454
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,120
So...

455
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah.

456
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,100
Oopsie.

457
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,300
Okay.

458
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,610
I'm a liar.

459
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,830
I accept that title.

460
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,670
A few fly sure.

461
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,510
But how does it taste?

462
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:06,890
Oh, yeah.

463
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,170
Right?

464
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:07,810
It's probably fine.

465
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:09,690
Okay.

466
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,270
Okay.

467
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:13,750
What?

468
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,310
Not here?

469
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,770
Will they wake him up?

470
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,770
I can't remember.

471
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:23,990
Gosh.

472
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,390
I completely forgot about this part.

473
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,090
I shouldn't have gone...

474
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,030
Gone under the...

475
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,490
I shouldn't have gone under here.

476
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:28,990
I think.

477
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,430
Okay.

478
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,650
Wait a second.

479
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,350
Oh.

480
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,690
This is not a trick.

481
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,910
I saw the blood.

482
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,670
It was like...

483
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,910
Oh my god.

484
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,490
It's not a trick.

485
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,400
He's like quivering in his booties behind the tree.

486
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,620
Oh, I forgot that we lost it.

487
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,360
Oh, no.

488
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,760
Oh, my gosh.

489
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,200
Yeah.

490
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,420
If I just keep going at it.

491
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,360
Yeah, he'll go to sleep eventually, so true.

492
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,860
Oh my gosh, okay.

493
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,340
How do I want to do this then?

494
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,680
Do you F with...

495
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:14,940
Castlevania?

496
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,320
Yes!

497
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,000
Move!

498
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,840
I do like, uh...

499
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,080
I do like Castlevania, yeah.

500
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,340
Should I be in my backpack?

501
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,460
Is that what she meant by get my stuff back?

502
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,280
Oh wait.

503
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,160
I don't think so, you guys.

504
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,360
I don't think so.

505
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,700
Where do you see the...

506
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,040
I am blind.

507
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,340
Alright.

508
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,280
Nighty night, fellas.

509
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:58,920
Fellers.

510
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,240
You guys, I'm so excited for my birthday.

511
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,840
But I'll be honest, okay?

512
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,500
I have to tell you something.

513
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,620
We are not celebrating my birthday on my birthday.

514
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,100
I...

515
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,900
I'm celebrating it the day after.

516
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,480
Oh my god, his poor leg!

517
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,860
Did you see it shaking?

518
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,620
Baby.

519
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:27,960
Move!

520
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,660
Hmm...

521
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,260
So...

522
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,740
Yeah, I'm sorry that it'll be a little bit late.

523
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:38,760
But...

524
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,920
His leg is so sad.

525
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:44,940
What's wrong?

526
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,460
Okay.

527
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,740
Time to what's wrong him.

528
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,620
Oh wait.

529
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,500
Because he's down, you're not gonna mess with him, is he?

530
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,020
Move!

531
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,000
Sorry, I completely forgot about this part, guys.

532
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,840
So just give me a second to get all...

533
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,920
reoriented and everything.

534
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,240
What's wrong?

535
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,480
What's wrong?

536
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,400
Um...

537
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,320
He'll be woken up?

538
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,040
I don't think so.

539
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,840
Unless they run over to him.

540
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,900
Where's the other guy that's...

541
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,080
Oh, here.

542
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,440
Okay, hold on.

543
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,980
I don't think he's gonna get woken up.

544
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,900
I think we're fine.

545
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,440
Now can I get this guy?

546
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,220
I hear them all running around...

547
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,220
Yeah, they don't wake up in this.

548
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,760
Yeah, that's why it says enemy 7.

549
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,480
Because we took them out.

550
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,420
Move!

551
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,740
And then I'll get to the...

552
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,500
I'll go to the...

553
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,660
I'll go to the...

554
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,220
rooftop.

555
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:47,980
Move!

556
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,940
Stop telling me what to do!

557
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,020
Stop telling me what to do!

558
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,400
Wait, isn't there a guy...

559
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,200
on the rooftop?

560
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,240
Let me think about it.

561
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,160
Oh my gosh, don't see me.

562
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,580
Don't see me.

563
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,980
I'm gonna crawl over.

564
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,380
I'll grab him though.

565
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,180
I'll CQC him.

566
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:13,960
Oh.

567
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,580
Gosh, he spooked me.

568
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,270
The camo index?

569
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:20,810
It's okay.

570
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,160
You weren't supposed to...

571
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,360
Hold on, wait.

572
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,180
You weren't supposed to turn around, you asshole!

573
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,200
Oh my god.

574
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,260
Don't stab me!

575
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:54,700
Oh!

576
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,220
I can't.

577
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:02,300
Take him down!

578
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,280
Yeah!

579
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,380
Okay, they don't notice me anymore.

580
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:06,800
We're fine.

581
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,300
Oh, they do, I think.

582
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,180
Up there!

583
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,840
Up there!

584
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,300
Where is it?

585
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,980
You can't even get me!

586
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,340
Dummies.

587
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,720
They're so stupid.

588
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,840
Anyway.

589
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,500
We're fine, everybody.

590
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,520
All we have is a severe burn.

591
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,260
Don't worry about it.

592
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,380
The guy turned around!

593
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,460
I was going to...

594
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,720
I was going to shoot him, but...

595
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,540
It's just...

596
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,140
It is what it is.

597
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,180
Ointment for the burn.

598
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,260
And then we bandage the burn.

599
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,980
It's like we were...

600
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,200
Never hurt.

601
00:24:59,280 --> 00:24:59,540
Ever.

602
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,720
It was a bit slow.

603
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,280
It's a bit of a slow...

604
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,560
Weekend for me.

605
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,260
Thank you!

606
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,480
It's like we were never ever burned.

607
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,920
I can get a cold in this game.

608
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,040
And actually...

609
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,440
I don't think I've ever seen that.

610
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,280
There he goes.

611
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,100
Why is it so silent?

612
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,680
Why is he naked?

613
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,660
Okay.

614
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,980
That's it.

615
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,600
Highly recommend playing Splinter Cell.

616
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,240
I don't know.

617
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,660
I...

618
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:55,860
I...

619
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,320
I'm obviously not against Splinter Cell.

620
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,040
It's just rather...

621
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,280
Oh my gosh.

622
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:06,800
Don't run!

623
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,560
Oh.

624
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,080
I have to find all the guys.

625
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,800
This is like a little hide and seek mission.

626
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:12,740
Okay.

627
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,720
I can get this guy.

628
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,520
They're not going to wake him up though.

629
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,000
Shoot.

630
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,080
I don't know.

631
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,100
Surely he couldn't still be on the...

632
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,060
On the...

633
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,500
On the ceiling.

634
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,540
That'd be nutso.

635
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,340
That would be absolute craziness.

636
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,920
If he just stayed up there the whole time.

637
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,320
No guy would ever do that.

638
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,440
Where'd they go?

639
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:37,800
Actually.

640
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,100
Oh

641
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,550
my gosh.

642
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,970
My aim.

643
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,450
It's fine if I just even get them once.

644
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,410
Oh.

645
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:48,670
Hello?

646
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,450
There we go.

647
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,970
They don't care.

648
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,390
Why?

649
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,170
What do you mean?

650
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,430
Shoot.

651
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:58,990
Uh oh.

652
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,690
That was too obvious.

653
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,230
I was just standing.

654
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:02,890
No.

655
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,290
No.

656
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,590
No.

657
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:03,750
No.

658
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,090
Up where?

659
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,030
She's under there.

660
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,230
You guys.

661
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:10,970
She's under there.

662
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,410
They're just like a little blind.

663
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,590
I wish that guy would come back though.

664
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:18,350
Hey.

665
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:18,710
Come back.

666
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:25,790
I have three left.

667
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,120
Hmm.

668
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,000
The one guy.

669
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,880
Where's the other two?

670
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,160
I were.

671
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,900
A little ocelot soldier.

672
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,380
Where would I be?

673
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:48,900
Underwear.

674
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,260
Oh no.

675
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,460
I made you say underwear.

676
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,780
Isn't that so embarrassing for you?

677
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,140
Try meowing at them.

678
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:05,920
Oh.

679
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:06,960
Oh.

680
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:20,990
Oh my gosh.

681
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:22,870
No.

682
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,610
Don't move.

683
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:25,950
Don't move.

684
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,930
You jerks.

685
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,990
I was so close.

686
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,190
Move.

687
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:33,690
No.

688
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:36,390
Move.

689
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,820
I should just have my gun out.

690
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,240
You.

691
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,300
You son of a...

692
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,520
Thank you.

693
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:52,640
Yeah.

694
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,890
That's a burn wound.

695
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,090
Remove all your clothing.

696
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,350
Slowly to not damage the wound.

697
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,210
Move.

698
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:09,750
Move.

699
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:10,490
All right.

700
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:10,790
Come back.

701
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:10,950
Oh.

702
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,130
Okay.

703
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,470
I'm just gonna go take care of them.

704
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:16,810
You guys.

705
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,270
I'm bored.

706
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,850
I'm bored of being up here.

707
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,520
If I just like...

708
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,500
Take them down.

709
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,360
If I just run.

710
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,020
Should be fine.

711
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,860
There's three of them.

712
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,860
But I only see...

713
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,200
How the...

714
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,360
Oh.

715
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:35,860
My camo.

716
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,180
That's why.

717
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,620
Go snake.

718
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,240
Go upstairs.

719
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:39,900
Snake.

720
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,240
I'm scared.

721
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,180
Snake.

722
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,200
Move.

723
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,160
Couldn't possibly be my ammo.

724
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:51,940
Okay guys.

725
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,600
But...

726
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,250
I don't know.

727
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,530
Where did he go?

728
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:04,810
Yeah.

729
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,190
That's right.

730
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,570
They're all going down.

731
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,090
One by...

732
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,070
Where's he hiding?

733
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,150
One by one.

734
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,960
Did I get him at all?

735
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,020
I don't even know if I did.

736
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,720
Pretty fast.

737
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,500
Can see why you love stealth games.

738
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,480
Aim.

739
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:25,780
Don't go.

740
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,620
Hey.

741
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,140
It's a controller.

742
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:27,680
Okay?

743
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,440
Controller is so hard to aim.

744
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:29,760
Okay?

745
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,560
Can you blame me?

746
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,380
Where's the last guy though?

747
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,140
I don't think I got him.

748
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,020
I

749
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:57,570
don't think I got him.

750
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,370
Controller being blamed.

751
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,550
VTuber.

752
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:00,970
VTuber.

753
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,930
How dare you blame the controller.

754
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,770
When it's literally...

755
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,390
You using the controller.

756
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,050
VTuber.

757
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,290
That's like so embarrassing VTuber.

758
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,870
Tiger stripe.

759
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,410
Going with the T.

760
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,070
You should game over again so we can see that cutscene again.

761
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,010
Wait.

762
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,190
Oh.

763
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,110
There is no way in here.

764
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,880
No matter where to stay in my birthday.

765
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,460
Kiki.

766
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,620
Happy birthday.

767
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,320
Happy birthday to you.

768
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,240
Happy birthday to you.

769
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,760
Happy birthday to you.

770
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,140
Where are they?

771
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,940
I think I hear them in there.

772
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,580
Happy birthday dear Kiki Kitty.

773
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,020
Happy birthday to you.

774
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,420
Happy birthday to you.

775
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:00,760
Punch him.

776
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,720
Where's the other guy now?

777
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,280
We have one guy snoozing on the job.

778
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,600
Hey Snoozer.

779
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,340
Where are you at?

780
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,240
I feel like he'd be up there.

781
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,920
I can't remember.

782
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,040
To the right of me in the grass?

783
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,660
Like over this way?

784
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,390
Wait, hold on.

785
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,970
I have... oh, wrong button.

786
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,190
I have...

787
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:45,590
Emotion D.

788
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:49,910
He's over there.

789
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,630
In the grass.

790
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,950
First time I played was to kill all the enemy soldiers with the neck cut.

791
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,470
Oh my gosh!

792
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,430
You're so brutal!

793
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,170
Yes?

794
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:15,810
Yes?

795
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:17,510
Yes?

796
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,590
Yeah, just your imagination, idiot.

797
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,410
It's Quincy.

798
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,190
Yes?

799
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,250
Awww.

800
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:50,890
They got stuff?

801
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,510
Wow!

802
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,610
Sea Med.

803
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,970
Time to loot!

804
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,130
Time to loot our little friends.

805
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,450
Oh my gosh, keep pressing the wrong thing.

806
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,310
Sea Med.

807
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,170
Suture kit!

808
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:10,750
Nice.

809
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,450
I'll take it.

810
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,030
What you got?

811
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,990
You got... oh, nice.

812
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,770
I'll take it, I'll take it, I'll take it, I'll take it.

813
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:22,910
What you got?

814
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,490
Corn meds.

815
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,130
Oh my gosh, a ration!

816
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,310
In another game?

817
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,110
In another life?

818
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,930
I would have been like...

819
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:35,910
Suppressor!

820
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,830
Everybody who was just like, rip suppressor.

821
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,610
We no longer have to say...

822
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,130
That...

823
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,830
Wait, didn't I get this guy earlier?

824
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,610
What about you?

825
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,750
I'm so sorry I shot you in the leg.

826
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,510
There's his blood on the ground!

827
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:55,970
Oh...

828
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,970
Oh yeah, thank you.

829
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,930
There's the stuff on top of the box.

830
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:01,690
Ow!

831
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:02,690
Get

832
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,600
ready!

833
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,900
Who is it?

834
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,160
Huh?

835
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,440
I've been waiting for this moment.

836
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,180
Oh my god, it's coming.

837
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,660
Oh god.

838
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,080
Hold on, I'm not...

839
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,300
I wasn't ready, my heart!

840
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,300
That's the stance.

841
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,100
I don't think so.

842
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:41,980
What?

843
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,420
A female spy?

844
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,830
This bitch is wearing perfume.

845
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:52,810
Oh my god!

846
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,770
Stay where you are.

847
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,610
I've had enough of your judo.

848
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,990
My judo.

849
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,770
I see you've got yourself a single action army.

850
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,650
That's right.

851
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,090
There'll be no accidents this time.

852
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,710
He took his advice.

853
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,690
Look at his back!

854
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,050
What did you say?

855
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,030
It's a nice gun, I'll give you that.

856
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,110
But the engraving gives you no tactical advantage whatsoever.

857
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,370
But the engraving gives you no tactical advantage whatsoever.

858
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,670
Unless you were planning to auction it off as a collector's item.

859
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,630
Unless you were planning to auction it off as a collector's item.

860
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,010
And you're forgetting one more very big thing.

861
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:31,910
And you're forgetting one more very big thing.

862
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,910
The engraving.

863
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,830
You don't have what it takes to kill me.

864
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,250
You don't have what it takes to kill me.

865
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,890
We'll see.

866
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,290
Dummy!

867
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:50,890
Dummy!

868
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,530
Dummy!

869
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,490
Dummy!

870
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,080
Dummy!

871
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,120
Dummy!

872
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,520
Oh god, it's that!

873
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,580
Oh god, it's that!

874
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,320
Yeah!

875
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,540
Yeah!

876
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,160
Yeah!

877
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,860
Look at the tire marks on his face.

878
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,120
Look at the tire marks on his face.

879
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,260
Baby!

880
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,560
Six shots.

881
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,620
That thing only carries six shots.

882
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,580
The Makarov carries eight.

883
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,660
You have to get a feel for how many you have left.

884
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,320
I can't.

885
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,520
This is a high-clutch weapon.

886
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,680
It's not meant for shooting people.

887
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,120
Damn!

888
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,900
You're so stupid!

889
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,340
What?

890
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,220
The fact that he gets so pissy.

891
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,100
This isn't over yet.

892
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,620
He gets so pissy.

893
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,340
But listens to him.

894
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:57,640
Don't.

895
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:58,740
Why?

896
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,100
He's still young.

897
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,580
Run away, little guy.

898
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,900
Little monkey.

899
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,440
Damn it.

900
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,480
I've got to get back before he does.

901
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,060
Go, go, go.

902
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,660
Go, go, go.

903
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:17,810
Oh, Eva.

904
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,930
What a woman.

905
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,470
Oh my god, she's crazy.

906
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,650
How much air is she getting?

907
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,850
Oh my god!

908
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,810
Damn, Eva.

909
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,750
The thing is, killing Ocelot...

910
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,510
Sorry, I was holding R1.

911
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,970
Killing Ocelot...

912
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,950
You solve so many of the game's problems.

913
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,550
But that's actually not even the case.

914
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,750
Ocelot's not our guy, you know?

915
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,690
Ocelot's not our guy, you know?

916
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,910
She remembers the basics of CQM.

917
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,050
Close corners motorcycle.

918
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,770
Big Boss's best attribute was to be able to roast enemy soldiers until they loved him.

919
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:03,830
Big Boss's best attribute was to be able to roast enemy soldiers until they loved him.

920
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:04,030
I know!

921
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,230
Everybody loves the legend!

922
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:06,790
I know!

923
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:06,790
Everybody loves the legend!

924
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,330
He nicked the enemy until they wanted his approval.

925
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:12,550
He nicked the enemy until they wanted his approval.

926
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,710
Like pick-up artists.

927
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,530
But he has the charisma, you know?

928
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,170
Unlike those pick-up artist guys.

929
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,810
Snake actually has the charisma.

930
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,570
Don't forget to breathe!

931
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:31,090
I literally had to bite my fingers to stop myself from continuing.

932
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,010
CBox!

933
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,810
Big Riz.

934
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,370
Was that everything?

935
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,470
Is there anything else?

936
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,050
Oh no!

937
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,510
Wait, I didn't get to finish mugging my guys!

938
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,510
Aww man.

939
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,180
Zombie!

940
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,940
NGS3 is just Ocelot's retelling of events.

941
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,960
Which is why everyone, especially Snake, is so cool.

942
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,420
Uh...

943
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:17,780
Oh.

944
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,980
Let's also get some... let's dispose of our food.

945
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,000
Dispose of our...

946
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,580
I don't wanna get... I don't wanna... I don't wanna get sick.

947
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,000
I don't wanna get sick.

948
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,180
I don't wanna get sick.

949
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,800
Okay.

950
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,090
Unless... any snakes?

951
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:42,510
Yep.

952
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:44,810
Oh!

953
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,110
Oh!

954
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,090
Oh my gosh.

955
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,290
I'm so stupid.

956
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,730
There we go.

957
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:50,870
There we go.

958
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,510
Yay!

959
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,990
Anything in here?

960
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:03,490
Nada.

961
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:05,990
Nada thing.

962
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,390
Ever play the 3DS version?

963
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,150
I've played it before.

964
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,350
It's just...

965
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,850
Really... besides crouch walking...

966
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:19,830
It's...

967
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:21,870
It's...

968
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,810
I...

969
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,990
I honestly am just like...

970
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,890
How can you play this type of game on such a small screen?

971
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,030
You know?

972
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,550
Still in a nightmare.

973
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,270
Snake feeder.

974
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,830
I didn't see any mushrooms or anything.

975
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,070
So I guess we'll...

976
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,110
Let me check...

977
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,070
Okay.

978
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:46,650
Please.

979
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,830
Please.

980
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,270
I'm trying to triangle over...

981
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:49,410
Okay.

982
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,510
I'll just go in.

983
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,870
I'll just go in.

984
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:54,410
I'll just go in.

985
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,310
Let me check in here.

986
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:58,490
Real quick.

987
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,810
I think...

988
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,370
Oh!

989
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,150
Wait!

990
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,250
You guys, we can do it ourselves!

991
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,350
What the hell is this?

992
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,550
We can recreate the moment!

993
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,050
What the hell is this?

994
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,930
3DS controls are fine to me.

995
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,970
I mean, if that's your opinion, that's totally fine.

996
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,450
It's harder for me.

997
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,450
It's harder for me.

998
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,230
Oki...

999
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,030
Bug juice.

1000
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,030
Doki.

1001
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:36,610
Let's go.

1002
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,750
I don't get the reference.

1003
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:40,630
Um...

1004
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,470
Watch...

1005
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,330
Me play...

1006
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,790
Metal Gear Solid 3 Pachi slot machine.

1007
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,800
Oh...

1008
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,360
Swamps.

1009
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,100
Swamps.

1010
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,620
Oh, let's codex some people first.

1011
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,300
A little bit.

1012
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,940
It looks like you've got rid of all the Ocelots.

1013
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:06,280
I did.

1014
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:06,740
Yeah.

1015
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,280
Now proceed with the rescue of Sokolov.

1016
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,060
According to Eva, you should start by going to the crevice to the north and...

1017
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,820
Can we trust her?

1018
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:14,700
What's that?

1019
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,040
Eva's with the KGB, isn't she?

1020
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,120
Can I really believe what she says?

1021
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,140
How do I know she won't double-cross me?

1022
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,940
There are no guarantees in espionage, Snake.

1023
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,340
Only calculated guesses.

1024
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,300
At this point in time, the KGB stands nothing to gain by stabbing us in the back.

1025
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,340
We're missing a lot of calculations then, I think.

1026
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,280
So you're saying I can trust her?

1027
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,480
I'm saying the chance that she'll betray you is low.

1028
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,500
Don't worry, Kev.

1029
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,580
I didn't know about the trinket, Snake.

1030
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,360
Of course, we checked the route she gave you against our own data.

1031
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,220
It looks like a pretty solid infiltration route.

1032
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,080
It makes good use of weak spots in the enemy's defenses.

1033
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,400
You shouldn't have any problems.

1034
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,520
Follow the route Eva showed you and proceed with the mission.

1035
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:51,340
Roger.

1036
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,580
If you're not a controller gamer, it's super bad.

1037
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:53,960
First, enter the cave through the crevice.

1038
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,320
See?

1039
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:55,860
It leads to the north.

1040
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:56,980
So head that way.

1041
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,860
Who would you pick actor-wise for your top five favorite characters?

1042
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,860
Actor-wise?

1043
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,680
Like voice actor?

1044
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,620
I see you have a calorie mate.

1045
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,820
Calorie mate?

1046
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,800
The thing you're holding now?

1047
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,100
Yeah.

1048
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:13,800
Oh.

1049
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,840
The little block that looks like a cookie?

1050
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:16,700
It looks like a cookie.

1051
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,340
Try it.

1052
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,880
It's pretty good.

1053
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:18,820
Okay.

1054
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,780
But what is this thing?

1055
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,820
I've never seen anything like it.

1056
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:22,900
It's space food.

1057
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,220
Calorie mate is an energy supplement.

1058
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:30,560
It contains all the proteins, lipids, vitamins, carbohydrates, and minerals needed for a balanced diet.

1059
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,300
It's a well-balanced food.

1060
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:32,880
Hashtag not sponsored.

1061
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,940
Because of that, it's just perfect for giving your body the nutrition it needs in combat.

1062
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,540
It sounds like a space-age food.

1063
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,520
It is space food.

1064
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,740
Real astronaut food is not very good, but that should taste fine.

1065
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:44,820
Yeah.

1066
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,660
And it'll help balance out all this jungle food I'm eating.

1067
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,540
Liquid calorie mate.

1068
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,880
It's easy and quick to eat, so it's perfect when you're running late for an important mission in the morning.

1069
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,560
Hashtag not sponsored.

1070
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,280
I've never been late for a mission.

1071
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:56,460
Really?

1072
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,560
Aren't you always keeping people waiting?

1073
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,520
Actually, I guess here...

1074
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,100
It's easy to keep track of your calorie intake...

1075
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,800
I guess maybe this is technically sponsored.

1076
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,100
... and receiving efficient body needs, so it's good for losing weight, too.

1077
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,740
All of the geisha girls in Japan use it for watching their calories.

1078
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,400
Ooh, wow.

1079
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,840
Is that why they're all so slim?

1080
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:12,860
Right.

1081
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,360
And any diet where you eat nothing at all is bad for the body.

1082
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,680
Sasuka, paramedic weeb.

1083
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,240
I see.

1084
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,240
Talking about the geisha girls.

1085
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,040
You seem to know a lot about Japan, don't you?

1086
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,020
Yes.

1087
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,260
I love Japan.

1088
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:22,860
I love Japan.

1089
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:25,960
Sorry.

1090
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,980
The way she says it.

1091
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:27,540
Yes.

1092
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,000
I love Japan.

1093
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:31,700
Weeb.

1094
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,600
Oh my gosh.

1095
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,080
Weeaboo.

1096
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:33,760
Get out of here.

1097
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,100
Yes.

1098
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,200
I see you've got yourself a ration.

1099
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,040
I love Japan.

1100
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,180
Rations are portable meals carried by Soviet soldiers.

1101
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,620
I've heard some nasty stories about how they taste.

1102
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,420
Me, too.

1103
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,760
I want to try an MRE stream.

1104
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:46,900
Great.

1105
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:47,940
I think I'll...

1106
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,020
I'm worried I might throw up.

1107
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,200
You should be grateful.

1108
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,240
Those things are designed to last.

1109
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,840
No matter how hard you try, they will not last.

1110
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,620
No matter how long you keep a ration, it'll never go bad.

1111
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:54,920
Yes.

1112
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,320
I love Japan.

1113
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,620
And they're surprisingly good for you, too.

1114
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,200
I'd take a snake over this any day.

1115
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,800
Even if it's a little rotten.

1116
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:07,220
How about rotten by like a whole... a whole... when was it?

1117
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,600
A whole two decades.

1118
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,780
Which snake has the best default outfit?

1119
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,740
For me, it's Venom.

1120
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,340
I'm a sucker for that poncho thing.

1121
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,000
Oh, I do love the poncho.

1122
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,580
Best default outfit, though, I'd say is MGS2.

1123
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,060
Yeah.

1124
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,520
I love that.

1125
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,240
Favorite actors, though.

1126
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,960
Mam, mam, mam, mam.

1127
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,100
Otacon...

1128
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,680
I think Otacon is at the top, for me.

1129
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,340
There's also...

1130
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,620
He's like in a lot of games, too.

1131
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,620
I love, also...

1132
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,600
What's his name?

1133
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,160
Josh Keaton.

1134
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,020
Yang Ocelot, maybe, too, for me.

1135
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,420
Of course, David.

1136
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,100
David Hayter, I'm not even gonna include because I think that's too easy.

1137
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:55,560
Yes.

1138
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,220
I think that's like ultimate number one.

1139
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,220
That's like number zero.

1140
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,360
Kiefer?

1141
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,220
I feel like Snake spends so much of his game out of his element.

1142
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,580
But whenever Ocelot shows up, Snake becomes the biggest bad.

1143
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,020
I know!

1144
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:18,960
He does!

1145
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,480
Oh, Cam Clark!

1146
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,200
Yes!

1147
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,640
Oh my gosh, Cam Clark is awesome.

1148
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,600
Cam Clark actually put him number one.

1149
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:32,160
And then Ocelot, and then Otacon, and then young Ocelot.

1150
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,060
You want to save?

1151
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:40,780
Yeah.

1152
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,680
And I'm gonna make a different save.

1153
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,080
New file!

1154
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,580
Let's see how the date does.

1155
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,320
If it changes.

1156
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:49,860
Let's see.

1157
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,280
Oh!

1158
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,620
Wow!

1159
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,840
So young, so fresh!

1160
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:09,040
I don't know why these codex are so...

1161
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,920
The audio is so low.

1162
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,340
...

1163
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,320
...

1164
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,180
...

1165
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:16,700
...

1166
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,040
...

1167
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,140
...

1168
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:19,360
...

1169
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,140
They're quite realistic.

1170
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,000
I've got all the real I can handle here in the jungle.

1171
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,600
Is the front part of your skirt connected to the mid part?

1172
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:24,900
Or are they separate?

1173
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,680
No, you don't get it.

1174
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,640
Precisely because it's realistic.

1175
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,420
Dolphy dream!

1176
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,220
With the images jumping out of the screen at you.

1177
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,800
Those are really expensive, though.

1178
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,200
It makes for a nice escape from reality.

1179
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,180
I have to admit, it made my eyes tired.

1180
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,180
But it was really intense.

1181
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:36,840
Oh.

1182
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,340
It's separate.

1183
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:37,660
Technically.

1184
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,620
Unfortunately, they don't make very many of those movies anymore.

1185
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,520
But if it's easier to make it connected, don't worry about it.

1186
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:41,960
When did it come out?

1187
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,080
Babycore, thanks for the 5k food!

1188
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,160
I was still in college, so probably about ten years ago?

1189
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,100
Guess I'm out of luck then.

1190
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:51,040
You know, they're coming out with household versions of video cassette recorders.

1191
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,100
Video cassette recorders?

1192
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,220
One day you'll be able to see old movies anytime you want.

1193
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:54,680
No way.

1194
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,380
It'll be like having a movie theater in your own home.

1195
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,420
Really?

1196
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,700
It's like if you had a record of a movie film etched onto it instead of music.

1197
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,000
It'll work the same way.

1198
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,300
Paramedic, you're a genius.

1199
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:06,760
No, really.

1200
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,340
And someday they might make movies where you control the characters yourself.

1201
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:10,860
What?

1202
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,000
Sounds like magic.

1203
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,380
It'll happen.

1204
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,560
Make sure you stay alive to see it, Snake.

1205
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,040
This lot plays a minor role in all that happens in MGS.

1206
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,440
Huey is the hub by which the entire plot turns.

1207
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,980
He's also the chur- Okay.

1208
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,220
Bait used to be believable, you guys.

1209
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:34,940
Hey, Snake.

1210
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,700
Remember back at the abandoned factory when you whittled the grip of that 45 down?

1211
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,180
Yeah?

1212
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,260
I've never heard of a customization like that before.

1213
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,140
Why the grip?

1214
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,000
Ooh...

1215
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,820
To fit it with a knife.

1216
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,200
A knife?

1217
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:46,920
A knife?

1218
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,080
What do you got there, Snake?

1219
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,440
A knife!

1220
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:49,980
Ow!

1221
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,260
I'll turn it up a little bit.

1222
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:06,700
Badass.

1223
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,140
CQC!

1224
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,200
CQC baby, CQC!

1225
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,040
Oh wait, hold on.

1226
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,440
Let's uh...

1227
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,880
After this one, I'll go into the box and call him.

1228
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,860
But he might have something to say about the AK first.

1229
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,500
Such a funny looking gun.

1230
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,900
It's so thin at the top.

1231
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,600
Like it just looks strange.

1232
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,660
Huh.

1233
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,940
Why would she have so much stuff?

1234
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,040
It does.

1235
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,500
Yeah, she must get around, huh?

1236
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:06,800
Yeah.

1237
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,820
She travels all over probably.

1238
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,500
Oh dang it, I did it again.

1239
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:15,140
There we go.

1240
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,500
Let's see.

1241
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,200
Cardboard box.

1242
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:38,250
I never use the anti-personnel sensor, I'll be honest.

1243
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,460
So I'm just gonna unequip it.

1244
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:46,720
Ugh!

1245
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:48,600
Ow!

1246
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,020
Box!

1247
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:52,760
Yippee!

1248
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,980
What would a box be doing in the jungle?

1249
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,740
That makes no sense.

1250
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,560
Oh my god.

1251
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,020
He has so much to say.

1252
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,660
We haven't talked to Sigint in a while.

1253
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,220
Hahaha.

1254
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,420
I did it again.

1255
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,700
This is how like Bigfoot legends are-are created.

1256
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,620
Someone sees a cardboard box running around in the jungle.

1257
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,640
They'd say it's like, Bigfoot.

1258
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,820
Except it's here, O'Brien.

1259
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:27,580
Hahaha.

1260
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,320
Uh huh.

1261
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,140
I'm not a big fan of the bigfoot.

1262
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:32,700
I've never played with that.

1263
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,360
Mm-hmm.

1264
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,560
She's kind of crazy.

1265
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,080
She matches my freak.

1266
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,040
Ooh.

1267
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,560
Nice.

1268
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,200
No safety!

1269
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:27,880
No safety!

1270
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,160
Yeah.

1271
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,720
The release lever's been taken off as well, meaning the hammer won't fall, even with the safety on.

1272
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,740
So I can just cock and lock.

1273
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:44,720
That, and you get the added bonus of not having any mechanical noise from de-cocking, even with the safety on.

1274
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,740
The perfect pistol for a sneaking mission, huh?

1275
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,640
Snake's about to cock and lock.

1276
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,380
Let's go, baby!

1277
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,740
Let's go!

1278
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,340
Uh, Snake?

1279
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,360
What are you doing?

1280
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,100
I'm in a box.

1281
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:04,920
I'm in a box!

1282
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,860
A cardboard box?

1283
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:06,920
Why are you in it?

1284
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,300
It's his destiny to be in the box!

1285
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,580
I was just looking at it, and suddenly I got this irresistible urge to get inside.

1286
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,180
Yeah.

1287
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,700
No.

1288
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,880
Not just an urge.

1289
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,100
More than that.

1290
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,620
It was my destiny to be here.

1291
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,840
In the box.

1292
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,040
Destiny?

1293
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:23,580
Yeah.

1294
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:27,820
And then, when I put it on, I suddenly got this feeling of inner peace.

1295
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:28,280
Yeah.

1296
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,120
I can't put it into words.

1297
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,220
Such a cat boy.

1298
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:31,960
Safe.

1299
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,720
Like this is where I was meant to be.

1300
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,240
Like I'd found the key to true happiness.

1301
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,660
Does any of that make sense?

1302
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,320
Not even a little.

1303
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,520
You should come inside the box.

1304
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,980
Then you'll know what I mean.

1305
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,820
Man, I don't want to know what you mean!

1306
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:51,880
Between you and Paramedic, is everyone but me that is hooked up with a major strain?

1307
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,920
Yeah, well.

1308
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:01,200
Anyway, I suppose even that dumbass box might make a decent disguise if you wear it inside a building.

1309
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,320
Oh, everybody's strange!

1310
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,500
Everybody's strange!

1311
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:08,900
Love it.

1312
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,420
What a cat.

1313
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,080
What a cat guy.

1314
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,980
It's my destiny to watch him in.

1315
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:12,620
It's my calling.

1316
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,220
Where is it?

1317
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:13,560
Stop.

1318
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,160
Nice.

1319
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,140
Any Gators afoot?

1320
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:22,340
Oh!

1321
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,500
What's a Gator?

1322
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:27,580
What's a log?

1323
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,260
Log or Gator?

1324
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,740
Put in your votes right now.

1325
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:33,340
Oh!

1326
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,600
I thought it was a log!

1327
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:35,780
Oh my gosh.

1328
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,700
I thought it was a log.

1329
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,060
But it was a gator.

1330
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,720
Guys, I'm gonna ask you to backseat.

1331
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,120
Because I don't remember where the craw cat is.

1332
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,360
So, if you would...

1333
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,680
Once we get there...

1334
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:00,520
I vaguely remember having to go up a tree and it being on a branch or something.

1335
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,240
On the left?

1336
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:09,650
Look at this guy!

1337
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:10,730
Look at him!

1338
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:11,210
Oh!

1339
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:12,750
There's so much stuff down there!

1340
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,270
How do I...

1341
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,170
I'm gonna take off the suppressor.

1342
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:20,230
I don't think we need it here, right?

1343
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:22,470
I don't remember there being any guys.

1344
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,190
Yeah, goodnight!

1345
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:28,590
Don't mind me.

1346
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:30,330
I'm just grabbing this stuff.

1347
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:36,490
Oh no!

1348
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:37,410
I got kissed!

1349
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:38,790
The kiss of death!

1350
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:39,910
The kiss of death!

1351
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:41,650
Oh my gosh, I got kissed!

1352
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:42,150
I got kissed!

1353
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,730
I got kissed!

1354
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:43,270
I got kissed!

1355
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:45,250
I also want this frog.

1356
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:48,950
Come here, frog.

1357
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:55,110
Come here.

1358
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:57,070
Frog!

1359
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,440
That guy's gonna wake up.

1360
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,160
Oh wait, I didn't get this one.

1361
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,340
Oh, just kidding.

1362
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,360
That's why I didn't get this one.

1363
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:16,300
Let's see.

1364
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,060
Where is it?

1365
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,040
Oh, do I have to go under cure?

1366
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,220
A leech!

1367
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,400
Blood-sucking leeches attached to the body.

1368
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,420
Stamina will continually decrease while leeches are attached.

1369
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,720
Burn them off with a lit cigar.

1370
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:43,590
Goodbye, leech.

1371
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,410
Oh, leech.

1372
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:47,010
Aw, leech.

1373
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:51,210
Wait, suddenly, for some reason, I don't want leech to go.

1374
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,270
How peculiar.

1375
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,490
Alright, let's watch out for any gators.

1376
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,300
It's kinda hard to see them, isn't it?

1377
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,340
Can I see them with the thermal goggles?

1378
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,640
Yes, but...

1379
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:21,620
Why?

1380
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,080
I'm also gonna take out my gun.

1381
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,100
Hug the left.

1382
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,300
Swim under the log.

1383
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,540
This is where I need to go though, isn't it?

1384
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:33,940
Like, actually?

1385
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,860
Isn't this just where I need to...

1386
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,200
How do I swim again?

1387
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,120
Oh no, I'm hungry!

1388
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,300
Oh gosh.

1389
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,480
Under the log to the left if you want the craw cat.

1390
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,420
But isn't this also just where I need to go?

1391
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,100
Ow!

1392
00:58:58,570 --> 00:58:59,070
Oh, I got a grenade.

1393
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:00,670
That's cool.

1394
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:01,790
Is there any fish here?

1395
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:03,350
Oh, there's other stuff.

1396
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,300
Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.

1397
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:34,630
Maybe the method is a little unconventional, but whatever works, works.

1398
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:37,910
Dead.

1399
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,470
I'm not on the nipple!

1400
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:43,290
Snake!

1401
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:43,850
Snake!

1402
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:44,150
Snake!

1403
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,110
I was breastfeeding!

1404
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:52,800
Okay.

1405
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,780
I think here...

1406
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,680
I should be...

1407
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,780
I should be naked.

1408
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,500
Yes.

1409
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:08,840
No uniform worn on the upper body does not provide much camouflage.

1410
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:13,030
Hold on.

1411
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:23,010
Do your thing, Snake.

1412
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:24,090
Please.

1413
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,100
Paramedic with... with a leech.

1414
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:29,920
Okay.

1415
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,540
I don't remember that one.

1416
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,000
With the leech.

1417
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:38,210
Spin around.

1418
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:38,730
What?

1419
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,150
You want me to make him throw up?

1420
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,610
You want me to make him throw up?

1421
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:49,410
It's fine.

1422
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:50,170
Alright.

1423
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:52,830
Okay, so I climb up... ah!

1424
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:54,030
I climb up here.

1425
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:57,330
Eva!

1426
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:58,070
Eva!

1427
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:02,550
Nice.

1428
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:07,790
What does that mean?

1429
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:09,330
Boss.

1430
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:14,630
Why are you naked?

1431
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:15,190
I don't know.

1432
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:17,170
So I can see the leech is better.

1433
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:28,050
Oh.

1434
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:37,790
The fact that she thought it was about her.

1435
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:40,830
She was like, huh?

1436
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:41,490
Wait, huh?

1437
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,470
Mm-hmm.

1438
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:52,610
Try me.

1439
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:56,890
She played Outer Wilds.

1440
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:58,830
Not the actual universe.

1441
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:02,550
The universe as the intelligence community sees it.

1442
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:06,750
I realized that the gravity in this universe was holding me back.

1443
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:07,810
Is that all?

1444
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:11,170
People and countries are both changed by their environment.

1445
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,010
And by the times.

1446
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:13,750
You and me both.

1447
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:15,530
That sounds like what the boss was saying.

1448
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:19,370
There's a world of difference between this country and America.

1449
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,850
But it's only a difference of position.

1450
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,570
A difference of perspective.

1451
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:24,250
Mm.

1452
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:26,690
Coming here made me realize something.

1453
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:30,350
Half of what I'd been told was a complete and utter lie.

1454
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:33,970
The other half was a conveniently constructed lie.

1455
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:34,210
Mm.

1456
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:35,790
Where's the truth then?

1457
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:38,250
It's hidden in the lies.

1458
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:39,230
In the lies.

1459
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:40,330
Are you lying too?

1460
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,710
Who knows?

1461
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:45,910
I've been trained to make even the most severe falsehood sound like the honest truth.

1462
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:47,490
Is she going to tell me to try that in a small town?

1463
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:47,710
Aren't you?

1464
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:49,250
No.

1465
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:52,090
I believe because I have to.

1466
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:53,710
Even if it is a lie.

1467
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:54,570
She believed.

1468
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,190
She lied.

1469
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:57,410
I'll have to remember that.

1470
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:57,870
Spieve!

1471
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:59,950
If you need me, give me a call on the radio.

1472
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:04,070
My frequency is 142.52.

1473
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:05,490
See ya.

1474
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,590
142.52.

1475
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:10,110
142.52.

1476
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,970
Let's dig in, guys.

1477
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:13,790
What do we want to eat?

1478
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,490
We want a reticulated python?

1479
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:19,490
Do we want to try the calorie mate?

1480
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:25,210
I feel like we should save this for like a... for like a fun moment, right?

1481
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:28,430
When I need it.

1482
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:30,870
Actually, guys, I have to go to the bathroom real quick.

1483
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:31,330
Is that okay?

1484
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,270
Is it okay if I run to the little ghosty's room?

1485
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,570
Can't spell Spieve without Eve.

1486
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,170
Oh my gosh.

1487
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,190
You're so right.

1488
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:45,390
But before... Here, I'll leave you guys with your own snack.

1489
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:55,900
Here's your own snack.

1490
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,500
You're welcome.

1491
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,820
Here, I'll be right back.

1492
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:00,900
I'll be fast.

1493
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,360
Mint, be fast.

1494
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,220
Mint, be quick.

1495
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:10,740
I'm still in a dream.

1496
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,460
I've gone fishing.

1497
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:14,880
Okay.

1498
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,500
B or B.

1499
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:50,760
I'm back.

1500
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:53,060
I'm back.

1501
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:53,440
I'm back.

1502
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:53,940
I'm back.

1503
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:54,600
I'm back.

1504
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:54,740
I'm back.

1505
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:54,960
I'm back.

1506
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:55,160
I'm back.

1507
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:55,320
I'm back.

1508
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:56,780
I'm back.

1509
01:06:58,860 --> 01:06:59,300
I'm back.

1510
01:06:59,320 --> 01:06:59,320
I'm back.

1511
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:00,100
I'm back.

1512
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:00,100
I'm back.

1513
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:00,100
I'm back.

1514
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:01,240
I'm back.

1515
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:01,240
I'm back.

1516
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:01,240
I'm back.

1517
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,640
Did you wash your hands?

1518
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,720
No, I just use my sleeves.

1519
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,140
Okay.

1520
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,660
Cool, let's go up this tree.

1521
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,280
Oh, my food, I'm hungry.

1522
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,980
Why did you admit that?

1523
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:25,940
I'm going to eat the python.

1524
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,860
Oh my gosh.

1525
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,260
He's such a monster.

1526
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,900
Look at this guy.

1527
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,100
Oh, nasty!

1528
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:37,980
Snake!

1529
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,320
Why are you going with such like...

1530
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:48,840
Are you gonna eat it or are you gonna spit everything out?

1531
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:51,860
Snake eater!

1532
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,440
Oh, he likes it though.

1533
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,740
That's tasty everybody.

1534
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:05,680
Oh, that's right.

1535
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:06,620
It's right...

1536
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,480
There, isn't it?

1537
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:09,000
That's it?

1538
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:09,420
Okay.

1539
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:14,860
Here we go.

1540
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,340
That's tasty.

1541
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:18,620
Okay.

1542
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,040
Careful now.

1543
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,040
Maybe I should kill these crocs down there.

1544
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:24,620
So that...

1545
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,880
If I fall, I don't die.

1546
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:27,700
You know what I mean?

1547
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,700
Maybe I should take them out.

1548
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,260
Then I can get some good food.

1549
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:32,840
Right?

1550
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:35,880
Never thought that snake eater was literal.

1551
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,280
Oh yeah, it is.

1552
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:39,980
Just don't fall.

1553
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:44,880
Oh, I'm still gone fishing.

1554
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:45,280
Thank you.

1555
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:45,880
Sorry.

1556
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,780
I realized also...

1557
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:53,160
I was just like, wait a second.

1558
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:54,780
My food would have been spoiled anyway.

1559
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,220
Even if I hadn't changed my clock.

1560
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,240
Because I hadn't played in a week.

1561
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,200
I do kind of want the food though.

1562
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,220
I want the gator.

1563
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:10,370
Leave the crocs.

1564
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:11,130
They did nothing wrong.

1565
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:15,450
You guys!

1566
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:17,070
Just don't fall.

1567
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:29,270
Yeah, food is based on real time.

1568
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:33,990
I was so close.

1569
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:35,390
Okay.

1570
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:40,040
The food.

1571
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,140
Oh, but I'd have to swim all the way back.

1572
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:43,420
Okay.

1573
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:45,540
Alright.

1574
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:49,400
Okay.

1575
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:52,560
Alright.

1576
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,780
If I do this, do I go into hang mode?

1577
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:03,930
Snake, turn around.

1578
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:05,970
Snake, climb up.

1579
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:07,370
Snake, climb up.

1580
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:08,690
Snake, climb up.

1581
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,250
Snake, climb up.

1582
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:10,650
Use your arm.

1583
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:10,950
Snake.

1584
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:12,150
Snake, climb up.

1585
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:14,270
Snake.

1586
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:15,230
Snake, climb up.

1587
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:18,710
Snake, your leg!

1588
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:20,290
What did you do?

1589
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:21,930
A broken bone!

1590
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,040
Oh my gosh, we have to do surgery.

1591
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,180
Oh my gosh, we have to do surgery.

1592
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,840
What do I do for a broken bone?

1593
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,000
A splint?

1594
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:39,940
And a bandage.

1595
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:42,120
All better.

1596
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:43,800
No more broken bone.

1597
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:51,050
Well guys, I wanted a snack, so...

1598
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:52,870
You think he's...

1599
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:59,850
The fact that he doesn't come after me is kind of crazy.

1600
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:01,570
There we go.

1601
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:07,200
Snake, just do it.

1602
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:07,620
Just go.

1603
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:10,540
Yeah!

1604
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:16,170
Nice!

1605
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:19,010
Okay, is it this side?

1606
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:20,210
Just around here?

1607
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:22,790
Just around...

1608
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:25,570
The river... Oh, I got kissed.

1609
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:30,550
Yeah.

1610
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:33,690
Rip suppressor is fine.

1611
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:35,630
I don't really...

1612
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:38,730
Shoot with it much.

1613
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:40,030
Goodbye!

1614
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:40,770
Thanks for the gift.

1615
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:47,990
Okay, Snake, you ready?

1616
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:51,270
Uh...

1617
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:55,560
Let's try this again.

1618
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:57,540
Oh!

1619
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:58,440
Here.

1620
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,140
Paramedic.

1621
01:11:59,140 --> 01:11:59,420
I forgot.

1622
01:11:59,560 --> 01:11:59,720
Here.

1623
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,720
I'll get... I'll get another one.

1624
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,320
Oh look, there's a fish here.

1625
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:04,080
This is good.

1626
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:04,480
This is good.

1627
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,420
Wait, why can't I use my knife?

1628
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,600
Oh, see, see, see.

1629
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:09,960
I got it.

1630
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,360
I got it.

1631
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,980
I wanna... Why can't I use my knife?

1632
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,540
Why can't I use my knife on the fish?

1633
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:22,030
Where is he?

1634
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:24,650
Where did he go?

1635
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:27,450
Oh, he's at my feet.

1636
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:34,690
Yay.

1637
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,920
Gone fishing.

1638
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,280
Yeah, now for real.

1639
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,160
Paramedic, I have leeches!

1640
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,620
Oh my god, my...

1641
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:50,800
Not there.

1642
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,460
Then where?

1643
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,300
See the leeches?

1644
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:55,540
Leeches?

1645
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:56,480
Bitches?

1646
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,540
Yeah, you've got leeches all over you.

1647
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:03,860
Leeches will sometimes attach themselves to you if you spend a long time in the water or the swamp.

1648
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:08,360
When you've got leeches on you, they'll suck your blood, causing you to lose stamina.

1649
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,700
You should get rid of them as soon as possible.

1650
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:11,000
No!

1651
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:15,840
To get rid of leeches, go into Cure in the Survival Viewer and press your cigar into them.

1652
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:22,840
Or, if you use the insecticidal bug juice ahead of time, the leeches won't bother you as long as the bug juice is in effect.

1653
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,160
I don't mind the leeches.

1654
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,400
I don't really mind them.

1655
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:28,120
They don't do much.

1656
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,380
They're just sucking a little bit of blood.

1657
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,180
Is blood that important to humans?

1658
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:36,080
I don't even know.

1659
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,480
It's like not that even big of a deal.

1660
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:41,840
We're totally fine.

1661
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:45,340
We're like so fine.

1662
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,660
It's like whatever.

1663
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,760
Just a little bit of leech.

1664
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,160
What?

1665
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,320
You could even see it on him!

1666
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:53,820
That was crazy.

1667
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,780
It's also crazy that they get...

1668
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:59,240
They go through my pants.

1669
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,220
How do they... how large is their teeth?

1670
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,260
Alright.

1671
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,820
I'm already hungry!

1672
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,560
No, I gotta get this hat.

1673
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:12,840
Please.

1674
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,620
This is really important.

1675
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:17,860
Okay.

1676
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,620
I think I...

1677
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,120
Shut up, snake.

1678
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:30,770
You can train grip here too?

1679
01:14:30,990 --> 01:14:33,590
Wait, there's a train grip in this game too?

1680
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:36,590
I tried...

1681
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:37,610
Okay, wait.

1682
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:39,130
To... hang on it.

1683
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:41,170
I tried pressing X.

1684
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:42,010
I think that was the wrong thing.

1685
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:42,530
Is it triangle?

1686
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:43,670
Oh.

1687
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:44,570
My bad.

1688
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:45,670
I pressed the wrong thing, you guys.

1689
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:52,760
Oh, I'm scared.

1690
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:55,360
Oh, I should have eaten first.

1691
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:57,080
I get it now.

1692
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,880
I get why you guys said that.

1693
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:02,580
But it's okay.

1694
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:03,520
We got this.

1695
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,100
It'll last.

1696
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:09,680
It'll last.

1697
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,200
It'll last.

1698
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:12,120
We're fine.

1699
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,520
Don't know what to write.

1700
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,060
Thank you.

1701
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:18,660
Thank you.

1702
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:22,280
Yippee!

1703
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,360
Yeah!

1704
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,660
Oh my gosh.

1705
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,720
We got the best thing in the game, baby!

1706
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,620
Gonna eat some...

1707
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:31,880
Oh, wait.

1708
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:33,120
Let's ask about our...

1709
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,460
Let's ask about our crocs.

1710
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,300
What if paramedic says, what are those?

1711
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:43,440
I see you've captured an Indian gavial.

1712
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:43,920
I did.

1713
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:49,960
The Indian gavial is a crocodile that originally lived in freshwater regions in India and Nepal.

1714
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,880
Why are Indian crocodiles way out here?

1715
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:53,580
Good question.

1716
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,540
They're captive crocodiles that were brought here for research purposes.

1717
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:58,200
But escaped and became wild again.

1718
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:58,760
Oh.

1719
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,840
Indian gavials are large creatures.

1720
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,780
Adult males grow to over six meters in length.

1721
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,760
You'll never catch one alive.

1722
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,180
Even if you use the tranquilizer gun.

1723
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,500
Got it.

1724
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:10,400
So...

1725
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,440
You'll never catch me alive.

1726
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,580
And I took that literally.

1727
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,680
Yes, I did look into that.

1728
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:16,460
You know what they always say.

1729
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:17,920
Tastes like chicken.

1730
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:18,680
Tastes like chicken.

1731
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:19,060
Sounds delicious.

1732
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,600
But be careful when capturing an Indian gavial.

1733
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:24,620
Normally, they're cowardly creatures.

1734
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:26,520
But the ones in the wild are not.

1735
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,860
The ones in the forest there are belligerent.

1736
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,620
Apparently, they attack humans.

1737
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:30,660
What do you mean?

1738
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,120
They weren't the direct subject of any serious research.

1739
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:39,000
But some think they may have become violent as a side effect of the atomic research that was conducted nearby.

1740
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:39,660
Aww.

1741
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,200
Aww.

1742
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:41,940
I'm so sad.

1743
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:42,860
Thanks for the super chat!

1744
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,960
Where is he storing that?

1745
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:48,620
In his pants.

1746
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:49,300
Probably.

1747
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:55,060
Maybe that's why everyone becomes in love with the legend.

1748
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,240
They're just like, wow.

1749
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:56,500
He's a legend.

1750
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,060
He's packing.

1751
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,340
Little did they know, it's just the croc hat.

1752
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,400
They're like, oh my god.

1753
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,000
How do I put it on again?

1754
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:09,800
Is it an item?

1755
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:11,400
Yes.

1756
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,960
We must get rid of...

1757
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:16,780
We'll get rid of the...

1758
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,560
Never mind.

1759
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,040
I can't get rid of the revival pill.

1760
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:26,280
We'll get rid of the fake death pill and replace it with the croc hat.

1761
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,060
Yay!

1762
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:44,460
I'm one of you now!

1763
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,480
Oh my gosh.

1764
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:48,440
Yay!

1765
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,080
Also, let's eat it.

1766
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,200
Oh, I forgot to eat it.

1767
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:56,480
Eat!

1768
01:17:59,260 --> 01:17:59,820
Really?

1769
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,160
The python is better than the crocodile?

1770
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:03,920
That's crazy.

1771
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:06,880
Arowana.

1772
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,240
I don't wanna.

1773
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,180
But you arowana...

1774
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:12,600
Oh my god.

1775
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,060
It's still alive.

1776
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:15,460
Oh my god, sushi.

1777
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:23,900
This, like, mukbang footage is just too much for me.

1778
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,060
The sounds are...

1779
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:27,080
That's it?

1780
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:27,920
That's all you're gonna have?

1781
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:29,380
Wow.

1782
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:31,060
Hmm...

1783
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:31,580
Yeah.

1784
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:33,580
Hmm...

1785
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,520
Pretty tasty.

1786
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:36,680
Ha ha ha!

1787
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:41,440
He left so much of it though!

1788
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,460
Oh my gosh...

1789
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:54,460
The back of the craw cat...

1790
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:57,640
I've never thought about how the craw cat is...

1791
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:00,080
Also, his hair goes through it.

1792
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,380
Have you noticed that?

1793
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:03,320
Oh wait, maybe it's his bandana.

1794
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,120
But the back of the craw cat is just very...

1795
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:09,120
very cursed.

1796
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,240
Oh yeah, let's call everybody.

1797
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,280
Look at my hat!

1798
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,600
Nice crack!

1799
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,740
Crocodiles taste apparently very gamey.

1800
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:27,540
Ahhh.

1801
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:35,660
Yeah, I know.

1802
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I know.

1803
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:46,020
Yeah, I can go really fast.

1804
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:47,620
Yeah.

1805
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:56,620
Oh, I forgot about the action button.

1806
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,160
Major Zero?

1807
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,480
Snake, you'll be helpless if a crocodile attacks you in the water.

1808
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:11,200
You can't see behind you when you're swimming.

1809
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:15,320
So, if you're in a crocodile-infested swamp, keep an eye on your six.

1810
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:15,980
My six.

1811
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:20,680
Also, by using your sensors, you should be able to detect crocodiles before they get too close.

1812
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:23,120
Hmmm.

1813
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:23,220
Okay.

1814
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:27,940
Snake, what in God's name...

1815
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,780
How does it look?

1816
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:30,520
I know.

1817
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,160
It looks cool.

1818
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:31,680
Yeah?

1819
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,120
It looks cool on you.

1820
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:34,420
I know.

1821
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:35,280
It does?

1822
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:36,260
Yeah.

1823
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,120
Yeah.

1824
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:40,060
I don't think cool is the right word.

1825
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:40,940
Well, what would you say then?

1826
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:41,140
Why?

1827
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,060
What's wrong with it?

1828
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:42,320
Yeah.

1829
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:43,520
What's wrong...

1830
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,140
Don't you think it looks silly?

1831
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,380
Doesn't it make you laugh?

1832
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,420
Aren't you going to ask me what the hell I was thinking?

1833
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:49,480
No.

1834
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,820
Snake is trying to be a little clown over here.

1835
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:52,980
I think it really does look good.

1836
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:55,120
It reminds me of The Alligator People.

1837
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,520
Oh, the...

1838
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:57,160
What?

1839
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,000
The Alligator People.

1840
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:00,520
It's a science fiction movie.

1841
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:01,740
You've never heard of it?

1842
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:02,740
No.

1843
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:03,500
I'm laughing.

1844
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,020
I'm laughing.

1845
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:05,660
Well, you should see it sometime.

1846
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:06,760
Everybody should laugh.

1847
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,640
Make you feel good.

1848
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,040
It's about this guy who gets hurt in a car accident and tries to heal his wound.

1849
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:13,480
Snake would literally be that person that's like the class clown in class.

1850
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,540
But then his head turns into a crocodile head.

1851
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:16,380
You look just like him with the mask on.

1852
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,000
Does something stupid hoping people will laugh.

1853
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:18,200
That's awesome.

1854
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:19,480
Right.

1855
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:20,800
Huh?

1856
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:22,960
Oh, never mind.

1857
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:29,040
I suppose you might be able to disguise yourself as a crocodile by wearing that cap and sticking your head out of the water.

1858
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:29,760
Yeah.

1859
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,300
Love the gif of Snake eating it on Discord of it.

1860
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:35,040
Yeah, sped up.

1861
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:36,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1862
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:38,900
I really like Paramedic.

1863
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:39,400
She's so cool.

1864
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,020
Yeah.

1865
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,580
Yeah, she is.

1866
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,080
Sigint, what do you think of my hat?

1867
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,080
Hey, you got an M1911A1.

1868
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:46,180
That's not what I'm talking about.

1869
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:46,340
Yeah.

1870
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:47,240
A 45.

1871
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:52,100
50 years since the army adopted the first model and they're still using them.

1872
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,760
It's a real gem of an automatic pistol.

1873
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:56,540
Sigint.

1874
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:58,160
But aren't you going to need more than just one little handgun?

1875
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,320
Not at all.

1876
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:05,180
When you're in a tight spot or fighting in close quarters, sometimes a handgun works better than a rifle.

1877
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:09,960
And if I equip a knife at the same time, I can instantaneously switch.

1878
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,400
Switch over to hand-to-hand combat.

1879
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:12,660
I see.

1880
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:16,500
That 45 you've got there is a lot different from the original, though.

1881
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:16,980
How so?

1882
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:19,180
Looks like someone did some serious work on it.

1883
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,060
It's more than a little.

1884
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,000
First of all, the feeding ramp is polished to a mirror sheen.

1885
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:27,080
It's not going to have any feeding problems.

1886
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:33,020
The slide's been replaced with a reinforced version and it meshes perfectly with the frame.

1887
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:34,960
He's geeking out, you guys.

1888
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:38,840
The frame itself has been iron welded and scraped down multiple times for maximum precision.

1889
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:39,400
Yeah.

1890
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:43,580
The front strap part of the frame has been checkered to make it dig into the hand.

1891
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,300
That prevents any slipping.

1892
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,360
The sight system's original, too.

1893
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:50,600
It's a three-dot type.

1894
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:54,880
It's got an enlarged front sight, giving it superior target sighting capability.

1895
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,600
The regular hammer's been replaced with a ring hammer.

1896
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:03,200
That enhances the cocking control and increases the hammer down speed.

1897
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,480
They also reworked the grip safety to accommodate the ring hammer.

1898
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:07,660
Wow.

1899
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:09,920
Looks like they eliminated it altogether.

1900
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:13,060
Why do we need SIGINT if Snake is like this?

1901
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:18,100
The thumb safety and the slide stop are extended to allow for more precise handling.

1902
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,260
SIGINT's over here taking notes.

1903
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:21,180
He's like, oh.

1904
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:22,620
So you can use a high grip.

1905
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:26,760
And the trigger itself is a long type for easy finger access.

1906
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,380
The trigger pull is about 3.5 pounds.

1907
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,020
That's about a pound and a half lighter than normal.

1908
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:35,340
The magazine well...

1909
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,980
Oh my god, he's still going.

1910
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:37,960
...put in a new magazine.

1911
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
The magazine catch button has been cut down low to make it harder to hit it by mistake.

1912
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:47,580
The mainspring housing has been changed to a flat type to increase grip.

1913
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:49,560
When did you have time to look at all of this?

1914
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,300
...so it doesn't slip and recoil when firing.

1915
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:57,780
On top of that, they added cocking serrations to the front part of the slide.

1916
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,740
Oh, 18 out of 18.

1917
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:00,260
I think we're good.

1918
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:01,700
That lets you load and eject cartridges faster in an emergency.

1919
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:05,480
Whoever did this is a professional.

1920
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:10,860
No question, this thing could shoot a one-hole at 25 yards in a machine rest.

1921
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:12,580
Well, I'll be damned.

1922
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,020
That's some gun.

1923
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:15,160
Yeah.

1924
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,420
I've never used a weapon this fine in my life.

1925
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,080
This fine.

1926
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:20,200
Wow.

1927
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:22,040
Oh my god.

1928
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,380
A cap shaped like a crocodile head, you say?

1929
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:25,860
Yeah.

1930
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:26,380
Yeah.

1931
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:27,500
What do you think?

1932
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,240
I think it's a great idea.

1933
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:29,660
Yeah.

1934
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,100
You know, animal disguises are one of the oldest tricks in the book in the intelligence world.

1935
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:40,420
I don't know whether it's true or not, but I've heard that during World War II, the OSS used to use cow suits.

1936
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,140
Cow suits?

1937
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:47,120
Supposedly, they sent agents out to hide in herds of real cows so they could spy on enemy units as they passed by.

1938
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:49,700
Giving up books worth of gun facts.

1939
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:52,340
Nowadays, I guess most people wouldn't even give a crocodile shaped cap a second look.

1940
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,200
They'd think it was just a gag item.

1941
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,840
But if you use it the right way, it can be an effective weapon for spying.

1942
01:24:59,100 --> 01:24:59,500
Spying?

1943
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,820
I gotta hand it to you, Snake.

1944
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:01,920
You're one sharp guy.

1945
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:04,860
You okay, Snake?

1946
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,260
Forget it.

1947
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:07,760
Huh?

1948
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:11,300
All he wanted is a laugh, you guys.

1949
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:12,980
All he wanted was a laugh.

1950
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,980
Not even just a little chortle, a chuckle, anything.

1951
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:21,740
No one gives him a single little...

1952
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:22,300
Oh my gosh.

1953
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,500
So funny.

1954
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:26,940
Fish.

1955
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:29,880
Okay.

1956
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,060
I wanna get those down there, obviously.

1957
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:33,040
Is there anything?

1958
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,180
I mean, I'm sure there's stuff.

1959
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,160
Wait, that's where we...

1960
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:37,580
Okay, wait.

1961
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:38,440
Where is...

1962
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,000
We came from over there.

1963
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:44,020
Can I get up on that land over there?

1964
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:44,840
I can't remember.

1965
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:46,480
Let's try.

1966
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:51,420
Stun gun.

1967
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,660
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1968
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,760
Oh, I got kissed.

1969
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:11,070
You won't fool me.

1970
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:13,010
Probably.

1971
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:21,840
It's our mushroom.

1972
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:41,420
That area is known as Chorni Prud.

1973
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:44,540
The name means something like the black shore in Russian.

1974
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:45,280
Chorni Prud.

1975
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:48,140
It got its name from the deep swamp that covers the area.

1976
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:51,900
The crocodiles in that swamp are extremely vicious.

1977
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,180
Vicious.

1978
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:56,060
Apparently, they've already chewed up a bunch of soldiers out on patrol.

1979
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:56,520
What?

1980
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,700
Now, no one even dares to go near the swamp.

1981
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:04,320
They said that most of the soldiers who were killed were attacked from behind while they were in the water.

1982
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:05,940
You be careful out there.

1983
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:06,500
I'm okay.

1984
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:14,230
What kind of unit are those ocelots I fought a little while ago?

1985
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:16,490
The ocelot unit is an elite group...

1986
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:17,490
Is she allowed to talk to us?

1987
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:17,950
Like...

1988
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:20,450
Are they just not paying attention to her?

1989
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:22,070
The special forces wing of Gru.

1990
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:25,650
They've undergone even more rigorous training than regular.

1991
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:29,290
Their skill with weapons is the stuff of legends.

1992
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:32,490
You'll find they're much better shots than the rest of Gru.

1993
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:33,410
Watch yourself.

1994
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:42,270
The crevice that leads to the cave is still a ways to the north.

1995
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:43,490
Keep heading that way.

1996
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:45,230
Okay.

1997
01:27:46,210 --> 01:27:47,250
But like...

1998
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:49,550
There's a trap here.

1999
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:51,690
She's on the toilet.

2000
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:53,650
Obviously.

2001
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:54,510
Obviously.

2002
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:10,770
Why is it so hard sometimes?

2003
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:14,130
You almost got me.

2004
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:16,410
Hey man.

2005
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:17,190
I'm in no trouble.

2006
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:25,740
I can crawl underneath it.

2007
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:26,920
Probably.

2008
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:33,740
My craw cat though.

2009
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,760
Don't get in the way, craw cat.

2010
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,560
Craw cat.

2011
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:38,400
Craw cat.

2012
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:40,300
Craw cat.

2013
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:42,540
Craw cat.

2014
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,520
It's bouncing.

2015
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,140
It's bouncing.

2016
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:44,660
It's bouncing.

2017
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,460
Oh, I have the leech on.

2018
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:49,780
Where is it?

2019
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:50,000
Oh!

2020
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:51,120
I don't see it.

2021
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:53,020
Wait.

2022
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,920
I don't see a leech.

2023
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:00,660
Do you guys see a leech?

2024
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:01,020
Oh, sorry.

2025
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:02,600
Do you guys...

2026
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,120
Ew!

2027
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:09,250
Gross!

2028
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:13,310
Ew!

2029
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:16,430
It's like a little tongue sticking out of my body.

2030
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:21,570
Eww.

2031
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:24,230
Okay, bye.

2032
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:28,700
Do you guys think I'll make it?

2033
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:29,820
Oh my God.

2034
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,000
The craw...

2035
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:43,960
We're playing...

2036
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,020
We're playing limbo with the craw cat.

2037
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:47,900
Oh my God.

2038
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,840
It's like resting right on him.

2039
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,040
Ah!

2040
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:52,840
Yeah!

2041
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,060
Oh my God, we made it.

2042
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:58,800
Eva!

2043
01:29:58,800 --> 01:29:58,860
Eva!

2044
01:29:59,020 --> 01:29:59,800
Was that you?

2045
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:12,460
Oh my god.

2046
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:15,820
Thanks,

2047
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:20,680
Eva.

2048
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:24,910
Thanks a lot.

2049
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,240
Eh, we'll leave it.

2050
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:31,620
Oh, hold on.

2051
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,820
I want to ask about the mushrooms.

2052
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:33,660
Sorry.

2053
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,340
So many...

2054
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:39,180
So many codex.

2055
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:42,620
Arowana.

2056
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:45,040
I don't wanna.

2057
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:49,560
Wow.

2058
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:53,800
Does that mean they're, like, endangered?

2059
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,300
I think I remember the arowana from Animal Crossing.

2060
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,020
And the knifefish.

2061
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,040
The coelacanth!

2062
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,880
Almost all organisms on Earth have evolved in various shapes and forms.

2063
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,820
But these fish have kept the same form for hundreds of millions of years.

2064
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:10,980
Baffling, isn't it?

2065
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:11,260
Wow.

2066
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,020
Sure.

2067
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:12,700
Perfect form.

2068
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,440
Well, I can see you're not interested.

2069
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:15,500
How does it taste?

2070
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:16,180
Not at all.

2071
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:17,500
I love ancient fish.

2072
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:18,260
Why?

2073
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:20,400
They taste pretty good.

2074
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,840
Oh, specifically the ancient ones, you guys.

2075
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:28,400
The ancient...

2076
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,800
Yeah, it's peak fish form.

2077
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,480
They don't need to change.

2078
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,140
Don't fix what's not broken, you know?

2079
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,000
Coral snakes?

2080
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:36,280
I don't even see one.

2081
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:41,980
Since leeches feed off their hosts, do you think when snake eats, they both go yummy?

2082
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:42,800
Yummers?

2083
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:43,600
That's taste.

2084
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:46,840
Mmm.

2085
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:49,100
Mmm.

2086
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:53,560
Red and yellow.

2087
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:54,480
Kill a fellow.

2088
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,460
Red and black.

2089
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:56,400
Friend of Jack.

2090
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,440
It tellementally destroys them from attacking.

2091
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:05,100
There are many animals that mimic the colors of known poisonous animals as a defense.

2092
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:09,960
See, by mimicking other poisonous creatures, they increase their chances of survival.

2093
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:15,400
There is another non-poisonous snake called the milk snake that borrows its coloring from the coral snake.

2094
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:15,740
Yeah.

2095
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:17,820
That's the one that's red and black.

2096
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:18,660
You're not even listening, are you?

2097
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:19,500
No.

2098
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,820
If red touches yellow, you're a dead fellow.

2099
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:23,460
Red and black?

2100
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:24,280
You're okay, Jack?

2101
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:24,780
Yeah!

2102
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:25,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2103
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:26,720
Yes.

2104
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:27,940
Yes.

2105
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:29,780
It says here that coral snakes are horrible at destroying their Queen.

2106
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:32,360
So yeah,

2107
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:47,660
if you ever see those, if the red... and you could tell in the picture too that it was red, yellow, red, yellow, black, red, yellow, black, yellow, red, yellow, black, yellow.

2108
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:53,840
But if it's red, black, yellow, black, red, black, yellow, black, then it's safe.

2109
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:58,700
And that's a rock fact.

2110
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:05,090
We don't go outside, Minto.

2111
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:05,890
That's so true.

2112
01:33:06,530 --> 01:33:06,930
You know what?

2113
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:08,050
That's fine.

2114
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:10,930
That's fine.

2115
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:15,350
I'm just saying if you go outside...

2116
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:17,750
Oh, this is the dogs.

2117
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:18,870
Oh no!

2118
01:33:19,950 --> 01:33:20,830
The dogs!

2119
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:24,410
Okay, let's put my shirt back on.

2120
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,930
What does mint on white mean?

2121
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:30,850
Um...

2122
01:33:32,030 --> 01:33:33,470
It means it's too late.

2123
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:42,870
What's the dog doing?

2124
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:45,130
I don't want the dog to be doing nothing.

2125
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:49,230
I don't want to fight the dog.

2126
01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:52,870
I don't want to fight the dog.

2127
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:02,870
Don't get hit.

2128
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,190
I'm trying to find that fence though, right?

2129
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:14,320
I think.

2130
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:19,880
I'm trying not to... I'm looking around for any traps.

2131
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:23,960
Or wait, is this the... this is the dog area, isn't it?

2132
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,680
Or am I crazy?

2133
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:27,140
Oh, my silencers!

2134
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:28,900
Oh my gosh, you're so right.

2135
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,420
Um, actually, they're not silencers, they're suppressors.

2136
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,740
Because I don't technically silence...

2137
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,120
Um, your gun.

2138
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:42,460
They only suppress...

2139
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:42,660
AH!

2140
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:51,490
Control here.

2141
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:54,650
We have evidence of an enemy intruder.

2142
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:55,570
Commence alert formation.

2143
01:34:57,730 --> 01:34:58,290
Acknowledged.

2144
01:34:58,290 --> 01:34:59,510
Sending reinforcements.

2145
01:34:59,590 --> 01:35:00,630
Use extra caution.

2146
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:02,390
I didn't see it.

2147
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:05,190
I didn't see the rope.

2148
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,240
Was there a rope there?

2149
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,600
I didn't... I didn't see the rope.

2150
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:22,080
Snake, at this rate, we're gonna...

2151
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,220
We're gonna run out of stuff.

2152
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:31,900
Look at the dog!

2153
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,760
I see him over there.

2154
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,340
They're not gonna come in through here, do they?

2155
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,280
They shouldn't, because this is all, you know...

2156
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:42,260
Oh, question.

2157
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:44,840
Can I crawl over the mines like I used to?

2158
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:48,040
You know, like how...

2159
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:48,760
Look at the dog.

2160
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,120
Yeah.

2161
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:54,680
Okay, I couldn't remember if I could or not.

2162
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:57,800
It's like all games except 5, right?

2163
01:35:58,700 --> 01:35:59,780
That I could do that?

2164
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:01,440
Oh my gosh.

2165
01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:03,200
Oh, god!

2166
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,360
What are you running around here for?

2167
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:07,800
Willy nil- AH!

2168
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:09,700
There's a mine there?

2169
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:25,130
I am stealthy.

2170
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:25,670
Stealthy.

2171
01:36:25,830 --> 01:36:28,510
Except that I ran over a mine, but that's okay.

2172
01:36:32,130 --> 01:36:37,620
I'm like 85% stealth.

2173
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,120
They'll leave.

2174
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:42,280
Let's keep going.

2175
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:47,700
They won't notice me.

2176
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:49,220
Maybe.

2177
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:57,940
There's one right there too!

2178
01:36:59,300 --> 01:36:59,820
Rude!

2179
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:04,140
I don't want them to notice me moving around, you know?

2180
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,220
But we do gotta take out that dog.

2181
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:09,940
Sorry, dog.

2182
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,880
Oh, he's gonna go to sleep.

2183
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:14,200
If it bites you and you die, it's venomous.

2184
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,640
If it bites you and you die, it's poisonous.

2185
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,140
Oh, wait!

2186
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:17,700
Sorry.

2187
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:20,840
If you bite it and you die, it's poisonous.

2188
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:23,960
Paramedic called the coral snake poisonous.

2189
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:24,360
Oh!

2190
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:27,440
Paramedic!

2191
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,320
You need to go back to med school!

2192
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,040
Paramedic!

2193
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,540
Get called out by my chat!

2194
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:33,660
Hi!

2195
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,660
Get called out, paramedic!

2196
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:39,020
You need to go back to school, snake.

2197
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:39,660
Can you...

2198
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:40,620
Can you...

2199
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,660
The dog just jumped over that?

2200
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:49,800
I think the dog just jumped over that tree?

2201
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,020
That log?

2202
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:04,500
Oh!

2203
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:05,020
What?

2204
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:06,440
How did you hear that?

2205
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:07,780
What do you mean, huh?

2206
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:10,560
What do you mean, huh?

2207
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:13,900
How did you hear that?

2208
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:19,600
Was it the dog going, He was barking at a squirrel or something!

2209
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:20,140
It's the...

2210
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:20,940
It's the jungle!

2211
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,060
There's so much stuff in here!

2212
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:23,900
What are you talking about?

2213
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:26,420
Huh?

2214
01:38:27,740 --> 01:38:28,180
Huh?

2215
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:33,140
You guys, I don't trust myself anymore.

2216
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,320
So I'm gonna just crawl.

2217
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:42,000
I don't trust...

2218
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,860
There's like one right by the tree, I remember.

2219
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:49,830
I don't trust myself anymore.

2220
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:53,610
Just the wind.

2221
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:54,270
Just the wind.

2222
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:57,010
Just the wind.

2223
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:05,460
Isn't there one?

2224
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:06,160
Yeah, it's right there.

2225
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:12,700
Some days they bark at a tree frog.

2226
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,160
Oh my god.

2227
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:21,540
When did you get here?

2228
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:24,720
When did you get here?

2229
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:25,560
Where is he?

2230
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:26,280
Oh, there he is.

2231
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:36,740
What the?

2232
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,260
Oh, there's a second guy!

2233
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:42,640
I think.

2234
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:44,180
I think.

2235
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:44,900
Actually, I can't tell.

2236
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:49,200
HQ!

2237
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:51,460
Nothing happened.

2238
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:53,820
HQ!

2239
01:39:54,980 --> 01:39:55,380
Ignore.

2240
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:57,940
HQ, we don't care.

2241
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:00,520
Can I go down from here?

2242
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,680
Or will I break my leg?

2243
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:08,180
Snake.

2244
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:11,200
Dangle dangle.

2245
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:13,140
Nice.

2246
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:14,840
Okay.

2247
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:19,500
Oh, oh.

2248
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:20,500
I don't trust it.

2249
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:23,700
I don't trust.

2250
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,180
Let's add some tiger stripe.

2251
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:34,080
I think that actually only does better because we're by the tree, but whatever.

2252
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,460
Is that a person?

2253
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,360
No, that's a tree.

2254
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:44,020
I'm scared.

2255
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:44,520
I don't trust.

2256
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:48,450
I don't trust.

2257
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:51,470
What if there's mines?

2258
01:40:56,790 --> 01:40:57,940
Can I even go this way?

2259
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:02,620
I have to go around.

2260
01:41:07,950 --> 01:41:09,550
No trust in the jungle.

2261
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:10,750
Exactly.

2262
01:41:12,510 --> 01:41:13,190
What the?

2263
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:15,290
Oh shit.

2264
01:41:16,330 --> 01:41:16,950
Oh.

2265
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:17,050
Oh.

2266
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:23,220
Oh, wait, who saw me?

2267
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:24,840
Ah!

2268
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:27,480
The dog!

2269
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:28,980
I can't fight the dog.

2270
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:38,800
Did I get him?

2271
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:40,720
Get his butt?

2272
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:41,220
Oh my god.

2273
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:43,380
Shit.

2274
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:47,060
Oh, they're seeing me.

2275
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:47,900
Shit.

2276
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:49,240
No!

2277
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:52,820
Oh my god.

2278
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:54,220
Uh.

2279
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:55,900
There we go.

2280
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:56,660
They won't see me.

2281
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:00,620
Oh, stupid dog.

2282
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:02,120
You made me look bad.

2283
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:10,730
What?

2284
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:11,390
Can you see me?

2285
01:42:12,410 --> 01:42:13,090
Oh my god.

2286
01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:15,350
How can you see me?

2287
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:33,480
I'm gonna eat this guy.

2288
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:37,140
What can I say?

2289
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:38,940
What can I say?

2290
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,820
I have a gunshot wound.

2291
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:43,300
I'm bleeding.

2292
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:47,520
Disinfected.

2293
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:48,800
What do I do?

2294
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:51,200
Bleeding.

2295
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:53,080
Bleeding.

2296
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:54,460
Um.

2297
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:56,600
Ointment?

2298
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:57,360
No.

2299
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:58,200
Styptic.

2300
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:00,340
And bandage.

2301
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:04,470
Yes?

2302
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:05,430
Oh!

2303
01:43:06,410 --> 01:43:08,030
Oh, that's cuts.

2304
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:11,630
Oh, do I have to get it out?

2305
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:12,750
Okay, there we go.

2306
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:13,090
Okay.

2307
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:16,590
Do you think they'll step on me?

2308
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:22,220
They're shooting at...

2309
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:23,880
Something.

2310
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,180
They have the...

2311
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:28,320
They have...

2312
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:31,500
They have that...

2313
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:32,160
The spirit.

2314
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:36,480
What are they shooting at?

2315
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:37,760
Oh!

2316
01:43:43,860 --> 01:43:44,880
Oh, go away!

2317
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:46,140
What?

2318
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:46,460
Oh!

2319
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:46,540
Oh!

2320
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:47,260
Oh my god!

2321
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:48,220
Ah!

2322
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:51,880
Shh!

2323
01:43:58,650 --> 01:43:59,050
Um...

2324
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:05,890
Like, they see me, but they don't.

2325
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:06,690
Like, they're kinda...

2326
01:44:07,330 --> 01:44:08,170
They're a little dumb.

2327
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:09,730
They're a little silly.

2328
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:15,140
I don't know if I can get him.

2329
01:44:27,390 --> 01:44:27,990
Oh, shit.

2330
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:28,850
Um...

2331
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:30,790
That's...

2332
01:44:30,790 --> 01:44:31,470
Okay.

2333
01:44:31,470 --> 01:44:32,310
You know what?

2334
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:39,800
This is a...

2335
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:40,240
A-okay.

2336
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:40,780
Probably.

2337
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:46,100
Where'd he go?

2338
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:46,540
Oh.

2339
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:47,140
He's running?

2340
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:51,530
He must be hiding nearby.

2341
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:52,790
Hunt him down.

2342
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:55,340
Oh!

2343
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:56,240
The dog is gone!

2344
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:57,280
Oh, shit.

2345
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,400
I should have paid attention to the dog.

2346
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,600
I wasn't paying attention to the dog.

2347
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:08,380
I hate the dogs!

2348
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,580
I hate the dogs!

2349
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:15,740
Oh my god.

2350
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:16,680
That guy scared me.

2351
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,440
So bad.

2352
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:18,240
Hello?

2353
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:20,260
Because

2354
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:24,370
of my...

2355
01:45:24,370 --> 01:45:24,710
Wait.

2356
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:25,350
I have another one.

2357
01:45:25,430 --> 01:45:25,950
We're fine.

2358
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:30,850
Poor dogs?

2359
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:32,630
What about poor Minto?

2360
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:47,880
Where's the dog?

2361
01:45:49,140 --> 01:45:50,920
The dog gets me every time.

2362
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:52,200
Oh my gosh.

2363
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:52,800
Wait.

2364
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:54,080
Why did that guy just go be like, huh?

2365
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:55,880
Why did he just freak out?

2366
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:00,340
Why did he freak out?

2367
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:00,680
Why did he freak out over there?

2368
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:02,040
I didn't even do anything.

2369
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:17,160
So, what's a good way to get rid of the dog?

2370
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,240
What's a good strat for the dog?

2371
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:28,580
Kill the dog!

2372
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:30,120
Eat the dog!

2373
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:37,980
Craw-cap?

2374
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:38,540
Really?

2375
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,060
Actually?

2376
01:46:41,380 --> 01:46:42,280
Does it actually work?

2377
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:48,440
What if I craw-cap?

2378
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:49,260
Crawl like a crocodile?

2379
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:53,400
Is he going to be like, ow, ow?

2380
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:03,960
Like, they can smell me.

2381
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,400
I'm a gator.

2382
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,320
Actually, I'm not a gator.

2383
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:13,900
I'm a croc.

2384
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:15,340
I'm a...

2385
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:16,920
I'm a dilla.

2386
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:17,680
Wait.

2387
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:18,400
Dial.

2388
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,380
He's like drooling everywhere.

2389
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:35,560
Wait.

2390
01:47:35,620 --> 01:47:36,560
He actually thinks I'm a crocodile?

2391
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:40,640
Oh.

2392
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:41,100
Oh.

2393
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,160
It works.

2394
01:47:52,710 --> 01:47:53,150
Onwards.

2395
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:55,730
Onwards, crocs.

2396
01:47:58,710 --> 01:47:59,990
I can't believe that works.

2397
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:13,480
Where's the rest of our guys?

2398
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:17,880
Caution's going to be over soon-ish, so.

2399
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:25,060
If I run with the craw-cap, I'm going to die.

2400
01:48:25,060 --> 01:48:28,100
Does he still notice me, or is it just crawling?

2401
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,100
It's so funny how this is...

2402
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:34,580
They don't even think...

2403
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:35,260
They don't even consider.

2404
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,260
This is the real stealth mission.

2405
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:48,360
I look so stealthy, for real.

2406
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:59,290
I look like a real crocodile, I think, right now.

2407
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:00,410
Hey.

2408
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:00,930
Hey.

2409
01:49:06,610 --> 01:49:07,050
Let's go.

2410
01:49:08,050 --> 01:49:08,670
I'm stuck.

2411
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:14,790
I'm waiting for this guy to turn around.

2412
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:20,380
Yeah, everybody leave, leave, leave.

2413
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:23,440
Actually, where did he go?

2414
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:29,420
He discovered a little cave or something.

2415
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:29,980
Where did it...

2416
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:30,920
Where's my man?

2417
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:31,040
Oh man!

2418
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:33,320
Oh there he is.

2419
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,500
He doesn't come over here though does he?

2420
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:37,260
Shit.

2421
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:45,680
Maybe I can get him from like here.

2422
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:50,180
If I can see him.

2423
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:55,410
If I can smell him.

2424
01:49:55,590 --> 01:49:56,070
There we go.

2425
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:02,300
Oh my god.

2426
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:05,060
We got him guys.

2427
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:11,550
We got him.

2428
01:50:11,630 --> 01:50:12,570
Don't worry about it.

2429
01:50:17,250 --> 01:50:18,430
What's that line for?

2430
01:50:24,150 --> 01:50:24,830
Let's see.

2431
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:29,970
Sorry I'm a camo changer believer.

2432
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:32,910
It's only five extra points but I'll do it.

2433
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:40,460
Wait is that a... I see him over there.

2434
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:43,440
I think I can get him.

2435
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:47,970
Right there.

2436
01:50:49,970 --> 01:50:51,030
I think I can get him.

2437
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:52,790
That is a guy though right?

2438
01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:54,810
Yeah that has to be a guy.

2439
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:56,290
I think I can get him.

2440
01:50:56,710 --> 01:50:57,790
I think I can get him.

2441
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:07,700
Don't think it was a mosquito.

2442
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:11,760
Yeah just your imagination idiot.

2443
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:14,060
Oh shit there's another guy.

2444
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:25,360
Hmm.

2445
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:31,180
Croc.

2446
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:38,220
What did you see?

2447
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,000
What did you see?

2448
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,480
You see a standing crocodile man?

2449
01:51:41,540 --> 01:51:42,800
That would be...

2450
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:45,100
Insanity.

2451
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:46,580
No one would ever see that before.

2452
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:48,920
What do you mean what's wrong?

2453
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:52,220
Oh shit there's another guy.

2454
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:53,300
Oh my god.

2455
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:57,520
No!

2456
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:00,040
What?

2457
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:01,600
Why are there three guys all of a sudden?

2458
01:52:03,860 --> 01:52:05,260
Where did you guys come from?

2459
01:52:12,390 --> 01:52:12,870
Oh.

2460
01:52:12,870 --> 01:52:13,030
Uh.

2461
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:14,750
Uh.

2462
01:52:14,930 --> 01:52:15,330
Who was that?

2463
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:16,170
Nobody.

2464
01:52:16,490 --> 01:52:16,710
Who was that?

2465
01:52:18,230 --> 01:52:19,110
Fucking shit!

2466
01:52:21,690 --> 01:52:22,130
Yeah,

2467
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:34,830
yeah, yeah.

2468
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:35,750
Show me where the...

2469
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:53,800
I think it worked.

2470
01:53:09,690 --> 01:53:11,250
Slam dunk baby.

2471
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:17,920
It worked.

2472
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:18,600
It worked.

2473
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:19,100
It worked.

2474
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:22,960
It worked.

2475
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:23,520
It worked.

2476
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:23,840
It worked.

2477
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:27,660
My poor suppressor.

2478
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:31,160
My poor suppressor.

2479
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:36,200
Perfect stealth.

2480
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:36,680
Exactly.

2481
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:40,460
Oh I don't...

2482
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:42,220
Oh let's take care of my uh...

2483
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:44,700
Cut!

2484
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:46,040
That's it you guys!

2485
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:46,740
Just a cut!

2486
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:50,740
Just a cut!

2487
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:51,400
Just a cut!

2488
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,160
We're bleeding?

2489
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:02,510
Oh disinfectant.

2490
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:07,580
Just a cut.

2491
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:15,930
I'm so stealthy.

2492
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:19,630
Doesn't matter.

2493
01:54:19,810 --> 01:54:20,050
Where...

2494
01:54:20,050 --> 01:54:22,630
Okay but seriously where did those other two guys come from?

2495
01:54:24,290 --> 01:54:25,290
Where did they come...

2496
01:54:25,290 --> 01:54:26,850
I didn't even notice them at all.

2497
01:54:27,870 --> 01:54:29,110
Where did they show up from?

2498
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,200
Is that a guy down there?

2499
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:52,640
I think so.

2500
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:59,740
Back up for when the dog spotted you?

2501
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:00,500
But no...

2502
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:02,280
I wasn't in caution anymore.

2503
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:03,560
So...

2504
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:05,580
I'm not sure.

2505
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:06,640
Oh.

2506
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,180
I can get his back I think.

2507
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:16,140
Just the wind.

2508
01:55:16,220 --> 01:55:16,580
Just the wind.

2509
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:17,780
Just the wind.

2510
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:19,680
Oh uh...

2511
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,100
Actually...

2512
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:20,460
Hold on.

2513
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:22,100
Sick aim.

2514
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:22,920
Sometimes...

2515
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:24,240
I have my moments.

2516
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:24,500
Okay.

2517
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:25,640
Just my imagination.

2518
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,040
Yeah just your imagination.

2519
01:55:31,350 --> 01:55:32,190
What is that?

2520
01:55:32,310 --> 01:55:32,770
Red dot.

2521
01:55:33,030 --> 01:55:33,770
What does that mean?

2522
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:40,800
Fall asleep little baby.

2523
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:45,280
Good night.

2524
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:45,500
Good night.

2525
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:56,660
Red dot is a thing.

2526
01:55:57,320 --> 01:55:57,840
Awesome.

2527
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:01,820
I think I can go in.

2528
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:04,640
Anybody else around?

2529
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:05,660
Oh not here.

2530
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:06,280
My bad.

2531
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:07,840
Anybody else around?

2532
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:11,440
I'm a leaf.

2533
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:12,940
I'm a leaf.

2534
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,160
I don't think it's a helicopter.

2535
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:20,740
I'm a leaf with zero...

2536
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:22,540
Uh...

2537
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:25,600
Zero camouflage.

2538
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:27,840
You got anything?

2539
01:56:31,060 --> 01:56:31,580
Nice.

2540
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:33,220
Any suppressors?

2541
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:35,260
Anybody got any suppressors?

2542
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:40,460
Suppressor would be real nice right now.

2543
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:44,420
You got...

2544
01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:44,920
Dang it.

2545
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:48,520
Bullets for the gun I don't use?

2546
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:49,360
No.

2547
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:50,160
No.

2548
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:50,220
No.

2549
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:50,240
No.

2550
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:52,600
Guys I'm a...

2551
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:54,720
I'm a pacifist.

2552
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,560
I don't need a...

2553
01:56:57,560 --> 01:56:59,460
A weapon that...

2554
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:00,440
Kills.

2555
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:01,360
Water!

2556
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:05,120
I don't think I've ever seen this uniform before.

2557
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:08,900
What kind of water are we talking about?

2558
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:10,880
Like...

2559
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:17,820
Oh!

2560
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:18,740
It's like...

2561
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:19,600
Clear...

2562
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:21,060
Effective when under water.

2563
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:23,140
What?

2564
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:25,540
It's like blue though.

2565
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:26,200
This is like...

2566
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:27,540
The water here has been yellow!

2567
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:31,520
I think maybe that also is just the...

2568
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:31,820
Um...

2569
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:34,400
The...

2570
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:37,140
What's the word?

2571
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:40,540
Perhaps...

2572
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:41,260
The...

2573
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:42,000
The piss filter.

2574
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:42,620
Oh!

2575
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:43,380
There's a guy over there.

2576
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:48,140
We're gonna get them all.

2577
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:51,040
We're gonna take them out.

2578
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:53,280
I could kill them.

2579
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:56,200
I could kill them.

2580
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:57,980
But I'm...

2581
01:57:57,980 --> 01:57:58,880
I'm merciful.

2582
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:01,760
Beep beep!

2583
01:58:05,470 --> 01:58:06,530
So whatever...

2584
01:58:06,530 --> 01:58:07,790
Is over there.

2585
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:10,630
And here's something for the glasses fund.

2586
01:58:11,070 --> 01:58:12,730
What do you mean glasses fund?

2587
01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:15,210
What are you talking about?

2588
01:58:15,490 --> 01:58:16,770
I've gotten so many guys here!

2589
01:58:17,830 --> 01:58:19,170
I'm doing well!

2590
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:20,270
Kind of.

2591
01:58:22,650 --> 01:58:23,250
Oh.

2592
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:24,330
Uh...

2593
01:58:24,330 --> 01:58:24,930
Uchimeshimes.

2594
01:58:27,430 --> 01:58:28,030
Oh!

2595
01:58:28,050 --> 01:58:28,650
I hope...

2596
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:29,750
No one...

2597
01:58:29,750 --> 01:58:30,330
Uh...

2598
01:58:32,710 --> 01:58:34,050
I hope no one's in here.

2599
01:58:37,010 --> 01:58:37,570
Okay.

2600
01:58:39,010 --> 01:58:39,570
Oh!

2601
01:58:39,650 --> 01:58:40,490
I found Kero-tan!

2602
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:43,510
I found him.

2603
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:49,350
Mousetrap.

2604
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:55,440
What do I hear?

2605
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:01,140
Oh, a suppressor.

2606
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:01,320
Oh!

2607
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,700
I feel like I'm hearing footsteps.

2608
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:11,300
I'm just...

2609
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:15,450
Maybe someone woke up.

2610
01:59:17,630 --> 01:59:18,510
You hear it?

2611
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:19,110
Or is it just me?

2612
01:59:19,270 --> 01:59:20,550
It might be low for you.

2613
01:59:23,130 --> 01:59:23,650
Huh.

2614
01:59:26,010 --> 01:59:27,110
Could also be...

2615
01:59:27,110 --> 01:59:28,290
My imagination.

2616
01:59:32,110 --> 01:59:32,890
I could...

2617
01:59:32,890 --> 01:59:34,430
Be hearing an animal, maybe.

2618
01:59:34,530 --> 01:59:35,010
Okay.

2619
01:59:35,030 --> 01:59:35,510
Uh...

2620
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:35,910
What's in here?

2621
01:59:41,730 --> 01:59:42,170
Oh!

2622
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:49,400
Uh...

2623
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:50,800
Oh!

2624
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:54,080
Rat!

2625
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:00,320
Rat!

2626
02:00:05,060 --> 02:00:05,500
Mousetrap.

2627
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:07,240
And they're not doing very well.

2628
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:08,860
Hello?

2629
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:09,620
Can I get out of here?

2630
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:09,840
Oh.

2631
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:12,300
Where am I supposed to go?

2632
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:13,440
Um...

2633
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:13,920
Major?

2634
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:15,060
I'm lost.

2635
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:16,160
Snake.

2636
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:16,720
That bird...

2637
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:18,680
The building next to you is a provisions storehouse.

2638
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:22,480
A provisions storehouse is where the enemy keeps their food.

2639
02:00:22,820 --> 02:00:25,540
Enemy units in that area use it to stock up on rations.

2640
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:25,880
Uh!

2641
02:00:26,220 --> 02:00:31,320
So if you happen to blow up a provisions storehouse, the enemies in that area won't be able to get any more rations.

2642
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:33,340
Spetsnaz are people too.

2643
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:35,820
They gotta eat, or their stamina starts to go down.

2644
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:36,720
I'm blowin' up.

2645
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:40,380
They might pass out more easily or lose their concentration and start to shoot less accurately.

2646
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:40,740
Oh!

2647
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,600
Who knows?

2648
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:44,740
They'll probably be a little more desperate for food just lying around.

2649
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,720
Basically, if you get rid of the...

2650
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:49,040
I can throw them snakes and stuff.

2651
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:55,700
They gotta eat.

2652
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:02,180
I got time and materials to spare, I believe.

2653
02:01:06,890 --> 02:01:07,190
Wait.

2654
02:01:07,670 --> 02:01:09,770
Actually, do I have materials to spare?

2655
02:01:15,370 --> 02:01:16,270
I have...

2656
02:01:17,330 --> 02:01:18,070
A claymore!

2657
02:01:18,350 --> 02:01:19,570
Wait, that won't do it.

2658
02:01:22,670 --> 02:01:23,870
I don't have anything.

2659
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:24,830
A grenade, maybe?

2660
02:01:25,950 --> 02:01:26,910
Get the grenade.

2661
02:01:27,150 --> 02:01:27,790
Somebody's birthday?

2662
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:31,350
Yesterday was my birthday.

2663
02:01:31,410 --> 02:01:32,310
I was hoping I'd get a happy birthday.

2664
02:01:32,430 --> 02:01:32,950
Brian!

2665
02:01:33,150 --> 02:01:33,710
Happy birthday!

2666
02:01:34,770 --> 02:01:36,850
Happy birthday to you.

2667
02:01:37,190 --> 02:01:39,290
Happy birthday to you.

2668
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:41,870
Happy birthday dear Brian.

2669
02:01:43,190 --> 02:01:45,610
Happy birthday to you.

2670
02:01:47,950 --> 02:01:48,850
Happy birthday!

2671
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:55,420
Some are saying that there's TNT in the area.

2672
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:00,020
I think that was the door that I just shut.

2673
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:04,660
I found a stone burning.

2674
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:17,360
I want that, though.

2675
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,460
What does the area include?

2676
02:02:20,820 --> 02:02:22,980
How big is the area we're talking about?

2677
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:31,440
This guy still passed out.

2678
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:34,920
Yeah.

2679
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:35,560
Oh.

2680
02:02:35,820 --> 02:02:36,540
There we go.

2681
02:02:41,820 --> 02:02:42,300
Grenade.

2682
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,460
You think I can just grenade it?

2683
02:02:48,490 --> 02:02:49,250
Maybe in here?

2684
02:02:52,470 --> 02:02:53,430
D-Med.

2685
02:02:54,130 --> 02:02:54,850
Oof-Med.

2686
02:02:55,910 --> 02:02:56,390
Antidote.

2687
02:02:58,290 --> 02:02:58,770
Bandage.

2688
02:02:59,130 --> 02:03:00,450
All things that I probably need.

2689
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:01,610
Where's the shot?

2690
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:02,530
Okay, let's try it.

2691
02:03:04,030 --> 02:03:05,090
I need TNT?

2692
02:03:05,090 --> 02:03:05,250
TNT?

2693
02:03:06,770 --> 02:03:08,030
Behind this building.

2694
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:17,320
Nothing?

2695
02:03:17,820 --> 02:03:18,760
There's a guy here?

2696
02:03:21,700 --> 02:03:22,180
Where?

2697
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:25,320
Oh, I see him.

2698
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:27,500
Mine.

2699
02:03:30,420 --> 02:03:31,380
To the left?

2700
02:03:31,860 --> 02:03:32,600
I'm confused.

2701
02:03:43,190 --> 02:03:44,950
Oh, I see a build- Wait, no.

2702
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:45,930
That leads into the cave.

2703
02:03:46,170 --> 02:03:46,830
There's nobody here.

2704
02:03:46,830 --> 02:03:48,350
That leads into the cave.

2705
02:03:59,220 --> 02:03:59,760
Doesn't it?

2706
02:04:00,460 --> 02:04:01,300
Or maybe not.

2707
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:02,240
Wait, I'm so confused.

2708
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:15,700
No, cave- Sorry.

2709
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:16,940
A cave is Ocelot.

2710
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:17,460
So in here.

2711
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:18,000
Okay, okay.

2712
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:20,220
I'm thinking of- Wait.

2713
02:04:20,900 --> 02:04:21,300
Grenades.

2714
02:04:21,580 --> 02:04:21,980
Grenades.

2715
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:23,400
No, geyser.

2716
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:23,560
No.

2717
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:24,620
There's no TNT.

2718
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:26,380
Unless- I don't think I picked it up.

2719
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:29,480
Weapon storage.

2720
02:04:30,740 --> 02:04:31,840
But there's no TNT.

2721
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:32,700
Oh, that guy's dead.

2722
02:04:32,700 --> 02:04:32,960
That guy's awake.

2723
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:34,840
Oh, it means everybody's probably awake now.

2724
02:04:35,380 --> 02:04:35,740
No.

2725
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:37,060
I did.

2726
02:04:37,180 --> 02:04:37,560
I got it.

2727
02:04:38,420 --> 02:04:39,940
Oh, but it's gonna be so risky.

2728
02:04:45,650 --> 02:04:48,430
Snake, that building next to you is an enemy armory.

2729
02:04:49,610 --> 02:04:54,210
As you might have guessed, those armories you sometimes run into are where they keep their ammo and other stuff.

2730
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:54,970
I got it.

2731
02:04:55,010 --> 02:04:55,230
I didn't even see it.

2732
02:04:55,230 --> 02:04:59,010
If you take out an armory, the enemy units in the area will have their ammo supply cut off.

2733
02:04:59,030 --> 02:05:00,410
It was covered up by all the other techs then.

2734
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:04,130
And if they know they're on their last leg, they'll use ammo a little more sparingly in a gunfight.

2735
02:05:04,790 --> 02:05:05,490
Bottom line, it's a good idea.

2736
02:05:05,490 --> 02:05:08,490
Bottom line, if you blow up an armory, the enemy's firepower decreases.

2737
02:05:10,110 --> 02:05:13,650
By destroying an armory, you can cut off the enemy's supply of ammunition.

2738
02:05:13,910 --> 02:05:15,630
That should make your job a lot easier.

2739
02:05:16,650 --> 02:05:18,710
I can't remember what I'm supposed to do here, though.

2740
02:05:19,310 --> 02:05:19,710
Good.

2741
02:05:19,870 --> 02:05:20,970
You've reached the relay station.

2742
02:05:21,090 --> 02:05:21,310
Yeah.

2743
02:05:21,330 --> 02:05:22,070
But stay alert.

2744
02:05:22,270 --> 02:05:24,010
That station is an enemy strong point.

2745
02:05:24,170 --> 02:05:25,830
The security is bound to be tight.

2746
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:26,690
Yeah, it is.

2747
02:05:26,890 --> 02:05:30,090
But there's no other way to get to the crevice if I don't make it through.

2748
02:05:30,890 --> 02:05:31,290
Exactly.

2749
02:05:31,510 --> 02:05:32,050
The crevice.

2750
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:33,350
That's where we fight Ocelot.

2751
02:05:33,690 --> 02:05:35,170
The crevice leading to the cave is in the north of that area.

2752
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:35,430
Yeah.

2753
02:05:35,490 --> 02:05:37,670
Find a way to slip past the enemy and head north.

2754
02:05:38,730 --> 02:05:39,130
North?

2755
02:05:39,250 --> 02:05:40,990
You can blow up the helicopter, too?

2756
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:45,070
Wait, does that make it so then that cliffside area, they don't bother you?

2757
02:05:45,150 --> 02:05:45,730
No way.

2758
02:05:45,990 --> 02:05:47,830
That would be huge.

2759
02:05:51,790 --> 02:05:52,590
Yes, actually.

2760
02:05:57,860 --> 02:05:58,640
Oh, what the hell?

2761
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:00,400
Please.

2762
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:09,280
Oh, my inventory.

2763
02:06:10,220 --> 02:06:10,880
Destroy it.

2764
02:06:12,220 --> 02:06:13,720
Let's destroy everything.

2765
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:15,980
They're going to get really mad at me.

2766
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:18,360
I got it.

2767
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:18,920
TNT.

2768
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:20,880
Yippee.

2769
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:22,000
Okay, how do we use?

2770
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:27,260
Where do I put it on the chopper?

2771
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,840
Press to set square.

2772
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:34,000
Press circle to detonate.

2773
02:06:46,780 --> 02:06:49,320
I can't tell who's awake and who's asleep, you know?

2774
02:06:54,470 --> 02:06:55,750
Under the helicopter.

2775
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:59,530
Press against the chopper to place.

2776
02:07:02,190 --> 02:07:03,570
Press against where?

2777
02:07:07,670 --> 02:07:09,450
I might need to get this guy again.

2778
02:07:13,850 --> 02:07:16,130
My suppressor is not doing so hot you guys.

2779
02:07:16,210 --> 02:07:17,030
I'm kind of nervous.

2780
02:07:19,390 --> 02:07:20,450
Kind of nervous.

2781
02:07:20,890 --> 02:07:22,250
I think that guy can see me.

2782
02:07:25,130 --> 02:07:26,130
I can't tell.

2783
02:07:26,410 --> 02:07:27,170
I'm going to change.

2784
02:07:27,390 --> 02:07:28,930
I'm going to take off my clothes.

2785
02:07:29,070 --> 02:07:29,870
Right in front of him.

2786
02:07:31,470 --> 02:07:33,250
To the olive drab.

2787
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:41,720
Where did he go?

2788
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:49,960
There's like no way to press against it though, right?

2789
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:51,580
I don't feel.

2790
02:07:53,260 --> 02:07:55,140
Also, where do I go here?

2791
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:55,840
I don't remember at all.

2792
02:07:58,660 --> 02:07:59,920
So like right here maybe.

2793
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:02,480
What was it?

2794
02:08:02,820 --> 02:08:03,460
Okay, set.

2795
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:05,520
Okay.

2796
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:08,160
I'll be back.

2797
02:08:15,780 --> 02:08:17,080
Set it on the sheds too.

2798
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:21,200
I do want to set it in...

2799
02:08:22,180 --> 02:08:23,880
At least, well I guess I can do this one.

2800
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:25,260
I'm already here, right?

2801
02:08:35,330 --> 02:08:36,810
Oh my gosh, I'm so loud.

2802
02:08:39,470 --> 02:08:39,870
Beep.

2803
02:08:40,270 --> 02:08:40,670
Okay.

2804
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:47,420
I'm hungry.

2805
02:08:51,180 --> 02:08:53,540
We have so much food, so I'm not even going to be...

2806
02:08:54,820 --> 02:08:56,280
I'm not even going to be like...

2807
02:08:57,200 --> 02:08:58,340
This tastes great.

2808
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:00,400
I'm not even going to be frugal.

2809
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:02,540
I'm going to be like, let's go.

2810
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:04,700
Camo.

2811
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:07,180
Thunderstrike.

2812
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:08,040
Going with the T.

2813
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:12,460
Is this guy awake again?

2814
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:18,660
Yes.

2815
02:09:18,820 --> 02:09:19,540
I see him.

2816
02:09:23,180 --> 02:09:25,440
Now if I blow up the first one, they'll all run to the...

2817
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:26,760
Helicopter.

2818
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:28,100
Assuming.

2819
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:28,880
Maybe.

2820
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:29,420
Maybe not.

2821
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:31,180
You know what?

2822
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:31,680
Maybe they won't.

2823
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,400
Who knows, actually.

2824
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:39,040
That's wishful thinking, isn't it?

2825
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:41,680
We'll get more people.

2826
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:45,240
Wait.

2827
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:50,380
Yeah, I'm going to do them all at once.

2828
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,160
I just got to...

2829
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:53,160
I'm going to get to the exit and then go bam, bam, bam.

2830
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:56,740
Which, wherever the exit is, I...

2831
02:09:56,740 --> 02:09:58,280
Wait, is that it right there?

2832
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:00,780
I found the exit.

2833
02:10:12,620 --> 02:10:14,420
I don't want to get seen by that guy.

2834
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:14,680
Okay.

2835
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:16,940
I think we're okay right now.

2836
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:21,240
Open up.

2837
02:10:21,500 --> 02:10:21,860
Okay.

2838
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:24,680
Plenty.

2839
02:10:25,780 --> 02:10:26,140
Okay.

2840
02:10:29,540 --> 02:10:30,260
Try looting.

2841
02:10:30,300 --> 02:10:31,460
Hope find another suppressor.

2842
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:33,660
It's okay if I don't.

2843
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:35,300
I'll just be.

2844
02:10:40,140 --> 02:10:40,940
I'll just...

2845
02:10:41,940 --> 02:10:42,520
You know.

2846
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:47,280
I'll just be.

2847
02:10:50,980 --> 02:10:53,540
I don't think that guy over here will notice me.

2848
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:54,840
Okay.

2849
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:55,660
Before we go...

2850
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:00,580
Let's do it behind the tree.

2851
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:01,420
There we go.

2852
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:02,920
So this guy can't see me here.

2853
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:08,860
Look, I can see you.

2854
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:11,040
This is HQ Bye.

2855
02:11:13,170 --> 02:11:14,410
This is HQ This is HQ See ya.

2856
02:11:14,470 --> 02:11:19,570
Oh, god.

2857
02:11:23,110 --> 02:11:24,830
It's time for a little...

2858
02:11:24,830 --> 02:11:29,430
I think this is correct.

2859
02:11:29,430 --> 02:11:29,570
Well, we're here...

2860
02:11:29,690 --> 02:11:30,250
Therefore...

2861
02:11:30,250 --> 02:11:30,450
Oh, my...

2862
02:11:30,450 --> 02:11:32,790
Look like the boss's info is right.

2863
02:11:33,370 --> 02:11:34,870
It has a dandy robot.

2864
02:11:40,370 --> 02:11:42,050
W slot☆ This is just too much.

2865
02:11:43,550 --> 02:11:44,110
Wahh.

2866
02:11:44,730 --> 02:11:47,110
Twice now, you've made me taste bitter defeat.

2867
02:11:47,850 --> 02:11:48,510
I know.

2868
02:11:55,290 --> 02:11:56,610
Hey, chill out guys!

2869
02:11:56,810 --> 02:11:57,670
This is our fight!

2870
02:11:57,770 --> 02:11:58,370
This is our fight!

2871
02:11:59,390 --> 02:12:03,610
Oh my gosh, we got the Ocelot Squad, we got the regular guys...

2872
02:12:10,910 --> 02:12:12,730
Why did you call them out then?

2873
02:12:16,010 --> 02:12:17,290
Why did you call them out?

2874
02:12:17,590 --> 02:12:17,750
It's just you and me.

2875
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:18,790
Yeah, it is.

2876
02:12:18,930 --> 02:12:19,970
No one to get in our way.

2877
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:23,130
Ocelots are proud creatures.

2878
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:25,870
They prefer to hunt alone.

2879
02:12:27,670 --> 02:12:28,410
Oh my gosh!

2880
02:12:42,910 --> 02:12:45,370
I'm like a monkey, I see someone do something, I'm like...

2881
02:12:48,810 --> 02:12:49,570
12 shots.

2882
02:12:53,410 --> 02:12:56,110
He's like, yeah, I used to have 6 shots, now I got 12 shots.

2883
02:12:56,690 --> 02:12:57,170
Dummy.

2884
02:12:58,630 --> 02:12:59,690
Yeah, keep going!

2885
02:12:59,850 --> 02:13:00,230
Keep going!

2886
02:13:00,610 --> 02:13:06,310
This time I've got 12 shots.

2887
02:13:11,890 --> 02:13:13,930
I clapped when I saw Ocelot.

2888
02:13:14,090 --> 02:13:14,590
Oh my gosh!

2889
02:13:14,910 --> 02:13:15,410
The tension.

2890
02:13:15,990 --> 02:13:17,790
The tension, baby.

2891
02:13:18,890 --> 02:13:19,370
Draw!

2892
02:13:20,490 --> 02:13:20,970
Draw!

2893
02:13:21,950 --> 02:13:22,430
Okay.

2894
02:13:24,530 --> 02:13:26,330
Give me a second, Ocelot.

2895
02:13:27,090 --> 02:13:28,350
Let me get behind this rock.

2896
02:13:30,710 --> 02:13:31,190
Okay.

2897
02:13:31,870 --> 02:13:32,830
One second.

2898
02:13:37,120 --> 02:13:38,040
Do I...

2899
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:39,900
I don't want to use my ache, I mean...

2900
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:44,440
I'll take off my suppressor.

2901
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:49,040
You can do that with revolvers too, right boss?

2902
02:13:50,820 --> 02:13:51,220
Yeah.

2903
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:55,120
Do we want the camo?

2904
02:13:55,380 --> 02:13:56,060
What, naked?

2905
02:14:00,790 --> 02:14:02,050
Wait, is there like a camo here?

2906
02:14:04,670 --> 02:14:06,890
Will Mint have better accuracy than the pouch he saw?

2907
02:14:08,070 --> 02:14:10,210
Find out... find out next time.

2908
02:14:10,230 --> 02:14:12,410
On the next episode of Dragon Ball Z.

2909
02:14:13,370 --> 02:14:15,230
If you tranquilize him, he gets special camo.

2910
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:15,490
Ah!

2911
02:14:15,670 --> 02:14:16,010
What?

2912
02:14:16,170 --> 02:14:17,470
Wait, what's the camo?

2913
02:14:19,690 --> 02:14:20,250
Oh.

2914
02:14:20,430 --> 02:14:22,090
Naked with the zombie face paint.

2915
02:14:23,410 --> 02:14:24,410
Zombie, zombie.

2916
02:14:25,850 --> 02:14:27,010
It's more like...

2917
02:14:27,010 --> 02:14:29,970
It's more like that skull guy from...

2918
02:14:30,590 --> 02:14:31,390
What's it called?

2919
02:14:34,350 --> 02:14:35,790
Call of Duty, right?

2920
02:14:37,090 --> 02:14:38,870
Oh, the animal camo!

2921
02:14:39,290 --> 02:14:40,610
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2922
02:14:41,330 --> 02:14:41,890
Alright.

2923
02:14:42,430 --> 02:14:43,850
Okay, well then let me...

2924
02:14:44,670 --> 02:14:45,230
Ghost!

2925
02:14:45,350 --> 02:14:46,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2926
02:14:46,210 --> 02:14:47,650
Oh, how could I forget that name?

2927
02:14:50,030 --> 02:14:52,290
Where are you?

2928
02:14:53,390 --> 02:14:53,790
Oh,

2929
02:15:00,120 --> 02:15:01,820
I should probably equip my gun.

2930
02:15:15,730 --> 02:15:18,510
Oh, he's reloading and I'm not doing anything.

2931
02:15:19,090 --> 02:15:20,170
I'm wasting my opportunity.

2932
02:15:21,470 --> 02:15:22,450
Oh my god.

2933
02:15:23,670 --> 02:15:24,070
Yeah.

2934
02:15:24,970 --> 02:15:25,990
Sorry, I lost a lot.

2935
02:15:26,170 --> 02:15:26,470
Oh gosh.

2936
02:15:26,610 --> 02:15:27,630
Okay, I gotta get my bearings.

2937
02:15:27,770 --> 02:15:28,610
Okay, I gotta actually...

2938
02:15:28,610 --> 02:15:30,470
Pay attention and play the game.

2939
02:15:32,170 --> 02:15:32,650
Wait,

2940
02:15:37,290 --> 02:15:38,350
can I get down from here, please?

2941
02:15:39,790 --> 02:15:40,490
Oh my gosh.

2942
02:15:42,970 --> 02:15:44,390
Who are you talking to?

2943
02:15:46,690 --> 02:15:47,890
Who are you talking to?

2944
02:15:55,580 --> 02:15:56,060
Ouch!

2945
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:00,120
Oh god!

2946
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:01,980
Oh my god!

2947
02:16:01,980 --> 02:16:02,440
Oh my god!

2948
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:04,140
Oh my god!

2949
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:11,800
I'm not okay.

2950
02:16:12,740 --> 02:16:14,720
It's going to be so good.

2951
02:16:15,660 --> 02:16:16,660
I'm such a freak.

2952
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:17,780
Wait, how did I get poisoned?

2953
02:16:17,940 --> 02:16:18,780
I think I'm in love.

2954
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:19,820
What's wrong with me?

2955
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:23,880
Venom poisoning.

2956
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:25,820
Oh, I think I got bit by a snake.

2957
02:16:26,620 --> 02:16:28,200
I have to do the serum.

2958
02:16:29,420 --> 02:16:29,800
Um...

2959
02:16:31,780 --> 02:16:32,720
Wait, is it under here?

2960
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:33,280
Oh, here we go.

2961
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:37,580
This guy... I don't think I've ever got bit before.

2962
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:40,060
This guy is such a freak.

2963
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:41,740
I cannot stand him.

2964
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:45,720
Ouch!

2965
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:47,080
This snake again!

2966
02:16:47,480 --> 02:16:48,760
You son of a bitch.

2967
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:52,280
Yeah.

2968
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:53,340
Die.

2969
02:16:56,840 --> 02:16:58,740
Ocelot, I'm fighting my own battles here.

2970
02:16:58,800 --> 02:16:59,020
Please.

2971
02:17:06,540 --> 02:17:07,580
You freakazoid.

2972
02:17:07,580 --> 02:17:09,280
You are such a little freak.

2973
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:11,340
You are such a freak.

2974
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:14,700
I love you so much, you my little freak.

2975
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:15,720
Wait.

2976
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:17,240
Dang it.

2977
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:17,600
Oh.

2978
02:17:17,660 --> 02:17:18,080
Oh.

2979
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:19,580
Dang it.

2980
02:17:24,440 --> 02:17:24,960
Where

2981
02:17:37,370 --> 02:17:38,050
is he?

2982
02:17:38,130 --> 02:17:38,690
Where did he go?

2983
02:17:38,810 --> 02:17:39,070
Oh.

2984
02:17:39,270 --> 02:17:40,670
I keep shooting!

2985
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:42,030
Such an idiot.

2986
02:17:42,290 --> 02:17:42,890
I'm sorry guys.

2987
02:17:43,910 --> 02:17:45,150
I'm actually so stupid.

2988
02:17:45,310 --> 02:17:45,670
Sorry guys.

2989
02:17:45,690 --> 02:17:45,770
Wait.

2990
02:17:45,770 --> 02:17:47,010
My brain is not okay right now.

2991
02:17:49,110 --> 02:17:50,430
I'm not even doing anything.

2992
02:17:50,750 --> 02:17:51,130
I'm not.

2993
02:17:53,910 --> 02:17:55,190
I think he... whatever.

2994
02:17:55,390 --> 02:17:55,930
Stay outside.

2995
02:17:57,290 --> 02:17:58,610
You are such a freak.

2996
02:17:58,690 --> 02:18:00,030
You are so freaky.

2997
02:18:00,170 --> 02:18:00,970
You are so freaky.

2998
02:18:02,610 --> 02:18:04,050
You are such a freak.

2999
02:18:04,110 --> 02:18:07,010
You are such a little weirdo.

3000
02:18:07,590 --> 02:18:08,390
Where are you?

3001
02:18:09,230 --> 02:18:10,710
Where did you go my little weirdo?

3002
02:18:11,950 --> 02:18:12,930
Isn't there a... Oh.

3003
02:18:12,930 --> 02:18:13,110
Wait.

3004
02:18:13,130 --> 02:18:13,390
Hold on.

3005
02:18:16,050 --> 02:18:17,390
I almost got him.

3006
02:18:31,140 --> 02:18:32,020
Come back out.

3007
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:34,500
Come back out.

3008
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:38,480
I need...

3009
02:18:38,480 --> 02:18:38,760
Oh.

3010
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,660
He is... struggling right now.

3011
02:18:45,820 --> 02:18:46,340
Ouch!

3012
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:52,060
I don't

3013
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:56,280
remember.

3014
02:18:56,480 --> 02:18:57,600
How did I do this before?

3015
02:18:59,440 --> 02:19:00,240
Oh my gosh.

3016
02:19:00,380 --> 02:19:01,740
I... Thank you.

3017
02:19:01,740 --> 02:19:02,680
Oh.

3018
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:03,640
The release.

3019
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:06,400
The button release kills me sometimes.

3020
02:19:12,050 --> 02:19:12,770
I know.

3021
02:19:12,790 --> 02:19:13,230
I see you.

3022
02:19:13,470 --> 02:19:15,090
I see you my little freak.

3023
02:19:15,570 --> 02:19:16,410
Where are you?

3024
02:19:16,550 --> 02:19:17,250
Did you leave?

3025
02:19:17,710 --> 02:19:19,070
You left me.

3026
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:28,140
Trust your instincts as a gamer.

3027
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:31,160
Any freaks or little weirdos in the chat?

3028
02:19:31,500 --> 02:19:33,480
You are so thrilling in the middle of the battle.

3029
02:19:34,960 --> 02:19:35,540
Oh my gosh.

3030
02:19:36,020 --> 02:19:36,420
Please.

3031
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:38,100
Please!

3032
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:41,260
I... Did I get his hat?

3033
02:19:42,180 --> 02:19:42,780
No way.

3034
02:19:59,940 --> 02:20:00,340
Yeah.

3035
02:20:00,360 --> 02:20:01,060
His hat is off.

3036
02:20:02,760 --> 02:20:04,500
I think I just got him in the balls.

3037
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:06,080
Yeah.

3038
02:20:06,140 --> 02:20:06,580
You did.

3039
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,200
I think you...

3040
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:12,080
Yeah.

3041
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:12,160
He died.

3042
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:17,180
Oh my god.

3043
02:20:21,850 --> 02:20:23,410
I'm only good at like one angle.

3044
02:20:24,270 --> 02:20:25,070
Where are you?

3045
02:20:26,190 --> 02:20:26,970
Where are you?

3046
02:20:27,010 --> 02:20:27,450
Reloading.

3047
02:20:27,530 --> 02:20:27,930
There you are.

3048
02:20:29,030 --> 02:20:29,470
Freak!

3049
02:20:33,620 --> 02:20:35,040
I love you so much, freak.

3050
02:20:36,900 --> 02:20:37,340
Ah!

3051
02:20:43,940 --> 02:20:44,380
Shit!

3052
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:47,380
You fool!

3053
02:20:57,950 --> 02:20:58,390
Oh.

3054
02:20:58,510 --> 02:20:58,810
There he is.

3055
02:21:00,310 --> 02:21:01,070
You fool!

3056
02:21:01,810 --> 02:21:02,390
Damn.

3057
02:21:02,610 --> 02:21:03,250
Oh my god.

3058
02:21:04,970 --> 02:21:06,190
Why do I...

3059
02:21:10,330 --> 02:21:11,570
Just let him keep going.

3060
02:21:11,990 --> 02:21:13,150
Oh my god.

3061
02:21:14,330 --> 02:21:16,050
Stop touching it like that.

3062
02:21:16,730 --> 02:21:17,630
That's a lot.

3063
02:21:19,290 --> 02:21:20,790
Oh my gosh.

3064
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:22,190
It was so weird.

3065
02:21:24,530 --> 02:21:28,090
I think I could have gotten in there but I chickened out.

3066
02:21:31,190 --> 02:21:31,970
I chickened out.

3067
02:21:35,090 --> 02:21:35,610
No.

3068
02:21:37,460 --> 02:21:37,760
I know.

3069
02:21:37,880 --> 02:21:38,760
I'm chickening out.

3070
02:21:38,860 --> 02:21:39,540
I'm chickening out.

3071
02:21:41,700 --> 02:21:42,800
I'm chickening out.

3072
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:43,780
I'm not going to fight you, coward.

3073
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:45,160
Ah!

3074
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:47,840
Not bad.

3075
02:21:56,110 --> 02:21:57,090
He's getting faster?

3076
02:21:57,290 --> 02:21:57,970
I don't think so.

3077
02:21:58,450 --> 02:22:01,110
Thank you for teaching me the joy of the long run.

3078
02:22:01,170 --> 02:22:02,430
He's so weird.

3079
02:22:02,610 --> 02:22:03,490
He's so...

3080
02:22:04,930 --> 02:22:06,530
He's actually so weird.

3081
02:22:15,140 --> 02:22:15,580
He's so weird.

3082
02:22:15,740 --> 02:22:16,180
Bastard.

3083
02:22:23,780 --> 02:22:24,840
Oh, I can't reach.

3084
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:31,540
He's so close.

3085
02:22:31,780 --> 02:22:32,240
Come on.

3086
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:32,380
Come on.

3087
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:32,580
Come on.

3088
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:32,840
Come back.

3089
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:34,260
Oh, there's bees.

3090
02:22:40,180 --> 02:22:41,040
I'm not okay.

3091
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:44,950
Oh my gosh.

3092
02:22:45,610 --> 02:22:46,570
Had enough yet?

3093
02:22:46,830 --> 02:22:47,350
No, no.

3094
02:22:51,510 --> 02:22:52,390
You bastard.

3095
02:22:52,390 --> 02:22:53,390
You're all gone, huh?

3096
02:22:54,870 --> 02:22:55,610
Oh my god.

3097
02:22:56,630 --> 02:22:57,450
Oh, it's grenades.

3098
02:22:57,770 --> 02:22:58,850
Stop shooting me.

3099
02:22:59,950 --> 02:23:00,810
Thank you.

3100
02:23:00,810 --> 02:23:03,730
Thank you for teaching me the joy of the long run.

3101
02:23:08,010 --> 02:23:08,930
Stand unopened.

3102
02:23:09,310 --> 02:23:11,710
Stand in the open unarmed for a special seat?

3103
02:23:11,810 --> 02:23:12,190
No way.

3104
02:23:13,470 --> 02:23:16,050
I can't tell if I'm getting trolled or not.

3105
02:23:16,530 --> 02:23:19,230
The Russian jungle is straight up reloading it.

3106
02:23:19,870 --> 02:23:20,330
Damn.

3107
02:23:20,330 --> 02:23:22,570
By it, I mean my remal.

3108
02:23:25,590 --> 02:23:26,230
Do it.

3109
02:23:26,290 --> 02:23:26,310
Do it.

3110
02:23:29,350 --> 02:23:30,550
Oh, I didn't even get trolled.

3111
02:23:30,550 --> 02:23:30,930
Oh, my god.

3112
02:23:31,730 --> 02:23:33,090
Oh, my god.

3113
02:23:33,170 --> 02:23:33,770
My...

3114
02:23:36,550 --> 02:23:38,190
I did get trolled.

3115
02:23:38,490 --> 02:23:39,890
The way he says it.

3116
02:23:39,990 --> 02:23:41,170
Stop, Ocelot.

3117
02:23:41,210 --> 02:23:42,190
I can't take this anymore.

3118
02:23:42,490 --> 02:23:43,090
Please.

3119
02:23:43,190 --> 02:23:43,610
Please.

3120
02:23:43,650 --> 02:23:45,210
My mind is melting right now.

3121
02:23:46,490 --> 02:23:47,090
Please.

3122
02:23:47,110 --> 02:23:48,370
I'm losing it.

3123
02:23:52,030 --> 02:23:53,310
I'm losing my mind.

3124
02:23:54,310 --> 02:23:55,390
It's a revolution.

3125
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:56,310
I can't take this anymore.

3126
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:08,780
What happened to the duel?

3127
02:24:09,380 --> 02:24:11,000
Oh, I had it equipped.

3128
02:24:11,260 --> 02:24:11,700
I had it equipped.

3129
02:24:12,400 --> 02:24:13,040
That's why.

3130
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:16,520
No, I missed it!

3131
02:24:17,360 --> 02:24:18,400
Because I have my gun.

3132
02:24:18,560 --> 02:24:21,240
Oh yeah, now he's reflecting.

3133
02:24:22,180 --> 02:24:23,480
He's getting stronger.

3134
02:24:23,960 --> 02:24:25,120
He's getting harder.

3135
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:27,040
No, I'm scared!

3136
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:27,120
I'm scared!

3137
02:24:30,460 --> 02:24:31,900
Can you see me if I climb up here?

3138
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:44,460
Where is he?

3139
02:24:47,560 --> 02:24:48,540
Oh, there he is.

3140
02:24:48,660 --> 02:24:49,020
Oh shit.

3141
02:24:49,940 --> 02:24:53,430
Oh my god.

3142
02:24:53,470 --> 02:24:55,410
You are such a weirdo!

3143
02:24:55,430 --> 02:24:56,530
You are such a weirdo!

3144
02:24:56,870 --> 02:24:57,490
Alright, Commander!

3145
02:24:59,110 --> 02:24:59,990
Oh my god.

3146
02:25:07,360 --> 02:25:08,920
You feeling it, Ocelot?

3147
02:25:10,660 --> 02:25:12,300
I can't tell where he stopped.

3148
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:13,920
Hold on.

3149
02:25:15,340 --> 02:25:17,300
My health is not bad, but...

3150
02:25:20,060 --> 02:25:20,940
I think...

3151
02:25:21,700 --> 02:25:22,360
I'll eat it.

3152
02:25:22,480 --> 02:25:24,080
I'll eat a little ink cap.

3153
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:27,440
Sick!

3154
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:29,980
Tasted bad.

3155
02:25:32,580 --> 02:25:33,580
Stop edging him.

3156
02:25:34,580 --> 02:25:36,220
I really am not meaning it.

3157
02:25:36,320 --> 02:25:38,760
I'm just... I'm just bad at this... I'm just bad at game.

3158
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:41,600
Oh, there he is.

3159
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:44,880
I'm just... I'm just bad at game, okay?

3160
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:46,040
Where did he go?

3161
02:25:50,170 --> 02:25:53,150
I'm just bad at aiming and gaming!

3162
02:25:58,270 --> 02:25:59,610
Where did he go?

3163
02:26:00,950 --> 02:26:01,490
God,

3164
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:17,300
you son of a...

3165
02:26:18,260 --> 02:26:18,800
God...

3166
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:22,420
Son of...

3167
02:26:22,420 --> 02:26:23,740
The boss...

3168
02:26:24,600 --> 02:26:25,540
Son of a...

3169
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:26,820
Son of a...

3170
02:26:27,960 --> 02:26:28,800
You're such a...

3171
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:30,280
You should not be named Ocelot.

3172
02:26:30,280 --> 02:26:31,320
You should be named Weasel.

3173
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:35,560
Ah!

3174
02:26:36,140 --> 02:26:40,410
Oh my god.

3175
02:26:40,550 --> 02:26:41,310
Okay, it's off, huh?

3176
02:26:42,770 --> 02:26:43,730
Like this?

3177
02:26:44,370 --> 02:26:45,310
It's a revolution.

3178
02:26:46,530 --> 02:26:47,570
Where is your head?

3179
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:48,170
Oh, there.

3180
02:26:49,590 --> 02:26:50,070
Shit.

3181
02:26:52,770 --> 02:26:53,250
What?

3182
02:26:53,310 --> 02:26:53,950
Here what comes?

3183
02:26:58,960 --> 02:27:01,220
Wait, the music quieted down for a second.

3184
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:01,960
What happened?

3185
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:06,000
That was weird.

3186
02:27:07,300 --> 02:27:08,980
Are there still some bees left?

3187
02:27:09,180 --> 02:27:11,720
I don't think so.

3188
02:27:11,940 --> 02:27:13,200
Oh, there is!

3189
02:27:13,380 --> 02:27:14,040
Okay, so...

3190
02:27:14,520 --> 02:27:16,400
When he goes on that side...

3191
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:18,400
Come back over here, Ocelot.

3192
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:23,640
Come back over here.

3193
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:31,300
You're reloading?

3194
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:31,900
Oh my god.

3195
02:27:33,180 --> 02:27:35,100
Oh see, I knocked his hat off again!

3196
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:39,540
That was so close.

3197
02:27:41,700 --> 02:27:42,180
Okay.

3198
02:27:52,770 --> 02:27:54,630
Oh my gosh, how romantic.

3199
02:27:54,630 --> 02:27:55,750
We both got each other.

3200
02:27:58,150 --> 02:27:59,410
I'm just playing with him.

3201
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:01,310
That's why I took his hat down instead of...

3202
02:28:01,310 --> 02:28:02,830
Oh my gosh.

3203
02:28:03,050 --> 02:28:06,090
Snake, I'm gonna need you to look the right way, please.

3204
02:28:07,670 --> 02:28:08,370
Thank you.

3205
02:28:08,370 --> 02:28:11,170
Thank you for teaching me the joy of the Revolver.

3206
02:28:11,310 --> 02:28:11,930
Oh my gosh, please.

3207
02:28:12,730 --> 02:28:13,170
Controller!

3208
02:28:13,390 --> 02:28:14,490
My hands are too small!

3209
02:28:15,150 --> 02:28:16,910
My hands are too small to grip!

3210
02:28:21,750 --> 02:28:22,830
Oh, there he is.

3211
02:28:25,010 --> 02:28:26,170
He does that.

3212
02:28:26,330 --> 02:28:26,630
I'll do.

3213
02:28:28,510 --> 02:28:29,390
Oh, did I?

3214
02:28:29,470 --> 02:28:31,070
I don't think I got him.

3215
02:28:31,190 --> 02:28:32,110
It's so messed up.

3216
02:28:33,770 --> 02:28:34,570
Oh my god.

3217
02:28:39,390 --> 02:28:40,610
Where do you go?

3218
02:28:54,520 --> 02:28:55,420
Little freak.

3219
02:28:57,200 --> 02:28:58,440
Oh, I think he left me.

3220
02:28:58,700 --> 02:28:59,580
I think he left.

3221
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:01,260
Oh my gosh, he's over there.

3222
02:29:01,740 --> 02:29:02,540
It's perfect.

3223
02:29:05,860 --> 02:29:06,820
Shut up!

3224
02:29:06,980 --> 02:29:08,020
Shut up out there!

3225
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:08,640
You!

3226
02:29:08,980 --> 02:29:10,140
What are you doing there?

3227
02:29:10,360 --> 02:29:10,860
Oh, Kero-tan.

3228
02:29:11,660 --> 02:29:12,580
Yeah, that's right.

3229
02:29:12,580 --> 02:29:13,180
Ouch!

3230
02:29:13,340 --> 02:29:13,540
Ouch!

3231
02:29:13,540 --> 02:29:13,780
Ouch!

3232
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:14,400
Ouch!

3233
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:15,000
Ouch!

3234
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:16,420
Hold on.

3235
02:29:16,440 --> 02:29:16,940
Hold on!

3236
02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:22,940
Snake, I need you to, like, recover faster, okay?

3237
02:29:24,580 --> 02:29:26,280
Okay, I complain.

3238
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:30,260
Oh my gosh, please.

3239
02:29:31,480 --> 02:29:33,180
Ocelot, you're going too fast, okay?

3240
02:29:35,340 --> 02:29:36,520
Oh wait, he's over there?

3241
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:37,160
So maybe...

3242
02:29:37,660 --> 02:29:38,140
Now?

3243
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:39,700
No, not now.

3244
02:29:40,320 --> 02:29:40,800
Oh.

3245
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:44,000
Where are you going?

3246
02:29:48,620 --> 02:29:49,360
Oh my god, please.

3247
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:53,680
What?!

3248
02:29:54,580 --> 02:29:54,940
Stop!

3249
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:04,240
Major!

3250
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:09,740
Forgive me.

3251
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:12,020
Distract him with the croc hat?

3252
02:30:12,100 --> 02:30:12,800
You think he'd like that?

3253
02:30:13,980 --> 02:30:14,880
I'm going up here.

3254
02:30:17,160 --> 02:30:19,420
Oh my god, look how bloodied I am!

3255
02:30:21,780 --> 02:30:22,600
Oh my god!

3256
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:23,580
I'm proud!

3257
02:30:26,450 --> 02:30:27,010
Stupid...

3258
02:30:33,790 --> 02:30:34,350
controller!

3259
02:30:43,580 --> 02:30:45,340
Oh no, time for the bees!

3260
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:52,280
Oh no!

3261
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:53,540
The bees!

3262
02:30:54,360 --> 02:30:55,540
Oh no, the bit rate!

3263
02:30:59,460 --> 02:30:59,940
Yeah,

3264
02:31:11,860 --> 02:31:13,260
that's what you get for shooting at me earlier!

3265
02:31:15,720 --> 02:31:17,480
Why'd you take off your mask?

3266
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:18,880
Oh my god!

3267
02:31:34,120 --> 02:31:37,260
You watched all your friends die and you didn't think to leave?

3268
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:46,690
Why didn't he do this in battle when the bees were around?

3269
02:31:49,030 --> 02:31:50,030
You were lucky.

3270
02:31:50,410 --> 02:31:51,630
We'll meet again.

3271
02:31:57,070 --> 02:31:59,230
I'm wearing this stupid-ass face paint.

3272
02:31:59,610 --> 02:32:01,490
I forgot to turn it off.

3273
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:15,600
Ghost from 1964.

3274
02:32:16,100 --> 02:32:17,260
Oh, we're in the caves!

3275
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:18,620
Oh gosh.

3276
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:20,440
We're in the caves.

3277
02:32:20,780 --> 02:32:22,040
Can't see anything.

3278
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:24,280
Can't see anything.

3279
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:26,140
Oh, it's actually so dark.

3280
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:27,920
Oh my gosh.

3281
02:32:29,940 --> 02:32:30,640
Oh, whoops.

3282
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:34,320
You were lucky.

3283
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:40,900
Wait, how does zombie paint give me more advantage?

3284
02:32:41,140 --> 02:32:43,420
Wait, oh gosh, it's so dark.

3285
02:32:43,960 --> 02:32:46,100
Oh, actually, I have them equipped, don't I?

3286
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:48,300
Alright, everybody.

3287
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:50,020
Watch your eyes.

3288
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:52,300
Oh, gosh!

3289
02:32:52,300 --> 02:32:55,200
Okay, it doesn't really do that much help.

3290
02:32:56,020 --> 02:32:58,340
We can at least see the snake in here.

3291
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:00,620
What is this?

3292
02:33:01,400 --> 02:33:02,200
It's a...

3293
02:33:03,940 --> 02:33:04,460
Snake!

3294
02:33:07,320 --> 02:33:08,800
It's a... Is this the crab?

3295
02:33:12,060 --> 02:33:12,580
Crab!

3296
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:15,900
Something crab battle.

3297
02:33:18,140 --> 02:33:19,020
Crab battle.

3298
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:23,720
Oh, in fact, I know what we can do.

3299
02:33:25,960 --> 02:33:27,100
Snake, are you okay?

3300
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:27,720
Snake!

3301
02:33:28,060 --> 02:33:28,500
Snake!

3302
02:33:28,640 --> 02:33:28,720
Major.

3303
02:33:29,460 --> 02:33:29,900
Snake.

3304
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:31,700
Are you alright?

3305
02:33:32,220 --> 02:33:33,060
You're not hurt?

3306
02:33:33,340 --> 02:33:33,780
No.

3307
02:33:33,940 --> 02:33:34,220
No.

3308
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:36,620
That was a hell of a drop, but I'm fine.

3309
02:33:37,300 --> 02:33:39,060
Looks like there's no way back up, though.

3310
02:33:39,320 --> 02:33:39,640
Yeah.

3311
02:33:39,860 --> 02:33:40,200
I see.

3312
02:33:40,360 --> 02:33:42,380
Well, anyway, it's good to hear you're not injured.

3313
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:46,620
Slipping and falling may not have been part of the plan, but getting into that cave was.

3314
02:33:46,820 --> 02:33:47,060
Yeah.

3315
02:33:47,240 --> 02:33:48,600
Proceed further into the cave.

3316
02:33:48,760 --> 02:33:48,920
Okay.

3317
02:33:49,580 --> 02:33:53,180
The cave seems to be structured like a maze, but there's an exit somewhere.

3318
02:33:53,180 --> 02:33:53,520
Okay.

3319
02:33:53,660 --> 02:33:55,940
Find a way out of the cave and head for the aqueduct.

3320
02:33:56,260 --> 02:33:56,700
Aqueduct.

3321
02:33:57,460 --> 02:33:57,900
Okay.

3322
02:33:58,780 --> 02:33:59,640
Oh, I...

3323
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:02,160
The cave seems to be structured like a maze, but...

3324
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:02,820
Got it.

3325
02:34:04,600 --> 02:34:06,220
Pyromatic, I'm gonna save real quick.

3326
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:07,080
You wanna save?

3327
02:34:07,340 --> 02:34:07,780
Yeah.

3328
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:08,360
Hold on a sec.

3329
02:34:08,620 --> 02:34:08,860
Okay.

3330
02:34:09,620 --> 02:34:10,060
Save!

3331
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:11,600
I forget sometimes I save.

3332
02:34:13,980 --> 02:34:17,160
I should be saving more often, honestly, because I'm scared of it.

3333
02:34:19,160 --> 02:34:19,600
Save!

3334
02:34:26,320 --> 02:34:26,960
It's loading.

3335
02:34:28,100 --> 02:34:28,540
Okay.

3336
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:31,440
Okay.

3337
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:37,100
Snake, have you seen 007 from Russia with Love?

3338
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:39,500
Nah, I don't like those movies.

3339
02:34:39,860 --> 02:34:41,920
Real spies are nothing like James Bond.

3340
02:34:41,980 --> 02:34:42,840
It's pure fantasy.

3341
02:34:43,180 --> 02:34:43,920
Pure fantasy.

3342
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:46,240
Snake, I don't think the Major's going to like you saying that.

3343
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:46,520
Mmm.

3344
02:34:46,840 --> 02:34:47,620
And even though it's...

3345
02:34:47,620 --> 02:34:48,840
The glowing mushrooms are in that cave, right?

3346
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:49,020
Yes!

3347
02:34:49,260 --> 02:34:49,700
Yes!

3348
02:34:49,700 --> 02:34:50,160
In here.

3349
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:52,520
What exactly don't you like about James Bond?

3350
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:54,300
I mean, is it the fantastic gadgets?

3351
02:34:54,560 --> 02:34:55,060
The cars?

3352
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:55,560
The guns?

3353
02:34:56,100 --> 02:34:56,340
Major.

3354
02:34:56,680 --> 02:34:56,940
Major!

3355
02:34:57,220 --> 02:34:59,660
Wouldn't you like to have a gun shaped like a pen?

3356
02:34:59,880 --> 02:35:00,440
That's a cute...

3357
02:35:00,440 --> 02:35:02,380
What good is a pen gonna do me in the jungle?

3358
02:35:02,480 --> 02:35:02,640
Yeah!

3359
02:35:02,820 --> 02:35:03,500
I'd look like a fool.

3360
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:06,180
Then what about a snake-shaped gun?

3361
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:06,540
Ooh.

3362
02:35:06,680 --> 02:35:11,460
You could make it look like you're grappling with a giant snake and then get a shot in on the enemy while they're distracted.

3363
02:35:11,460 --> 02:35:12,320
Okay, that kinda sounds awesome.

3364
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:13,920
Okay, now you're being ridiculous.

3365
02:35:14,260 --> 02:35:14,480
What?!

3366
02:35:14,480 --> 02:35:18,940
We'll make you a snake-shaped gun that folds up and fits into an attaché case.

3367
02:35:18,940 --> 02:35:20,440
Will you give it a rest?

3368
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:21,880
Oh, I get it.

3369
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:22,120
Get on it!

3370
02:35:22,120 --> 02:35:23,680
You're all about how to handle the ladies, aren't you?

3371
02:35:23,880 --> 02:35:24,240
No.

3372
02:35:24,940 --> 02:35:25,840
I knew it.

3373
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:30,840
To tell you the truth, I don't like the idea of playing hanky-panky with enemy femme fatales either.

3374
02:35:31,020 --> 02:35:31,280
Hanky-panky?

3375
02:35:31,360 --> 02:35:32,840
But that's part of Bond's appeal.

3376
02:35:33,100 --> 02:35:34,640
You could learn a thing or two from him.

3377
02:35:35,220 --> 02:35:36,400
I mean, what about this Eva?

3378
02:35:36,500 --> 02:35:37,520
What are you planning to do with her?

3379
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:39,680
I don't even trust her.

3380
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:40,020
Yeah!

3381
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:41,080
What do you mean, do with her?

3382
02:35:41,360 --> 02:35:43,040
You can't let yourself get involved.

3383
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:45,480
This is a game of spy versus spy.

3384
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:48,700
She's using you just as much as you're using her.

3385
02:35:48,940 --> 02:35:51,440
I mean, sure, yeah, but...

3386
02:35:51,440 --> 02:35:52,900
You've got to grab the initiative.

3387
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:54,560
Planning to press R what?

3388
02:35:56,100 --> 02:35:58,240
That's what a spy is supposed to do.

3389
02:35:58,560 --> 02:35:59,800
Get the upper hand.

3390
02:36:00,280 --> 02:36:02,000
I don't think I'm cut out for that mission.

3391
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:02,980
Hanky-panky.

3392
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,500
Maybe if you change your code name to 00 Snake.

3393
02:36:07,700 --> 02:36:10,580
007 is the biggest thing to come out of England since the Mayflower.

3394
02:36:10,820 --> 02:36:13,820
I wouldn't be surprised if they made 20 more of those movies.

3395
02:36:14,300 --> 02:36:14,780
00 Snake!

3396
02:36:14,780 --> 02:36:15,520
Didn't you know?

3397
02:36:15,740 --> 02:36:18,240
The Major is a huge James Bond fan.

3398
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:19,940
Man, don't get him worked up like this.

3399
02:36:20,560 --> 02:36:21,140
Worked up?

3400
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:29,700
Maybe you don't realize this, but now that you've got him started talking about Bond, I'm going to have to listen to him lecture for a whole hour after he gets off the radio.

3401
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:31,380
You have my sympathy.

3402
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:34,800
It's too bad you can't enjoy such a great movie, though.

3403
02:36:35,140 --> 02:36:38,360
I guess I'm just one of those people who can't enjoy spy flex.

3404
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:41,640
You'd think that like...

3405
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:44,460
Okay, actually, I don't know.

3406
02:36:44,600 --> 02:36:47,480
Do some people enjoy... like you... like...

3407
02:36:48,900 --> 02:36:51,760
Do some people... I guess it depends on like the occupation.

3408
02:36:52,740 --> 02:36:56,860
If you would... Do you think you would enjoy a movie about your occupation?

3409
02:36:57,880 --> 02:36:59,980
Because I feel like for me, it's like...

3410
02:36:59,980 --> 02:37:04,740
Not only would I relate to it, but I'd also be able to like kind of take myself out of the movie.

3411
02:37:04,980 --> 02:37:05,400
I don't know.

3412
02:37:06,120 --> 02:37:06,600
Depends.

3413
02:37:10,520 --> 02:37:13,700
Bond is 20 plus movies, but Godzilla is 30 plus?

3414
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:15,500
No, really?

3415
02:37:15,760 --> 02:37:17,160
My job is boring AF.

3416
02:37:17,160 --> 02:37:18,220
I mean...

3417
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:22,420
A VTuber movie.

3418
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:25,180
I don't know if I would watch...

3419
02:37:25,180 --> 02:37:26,920
Okay, I would watch a VTuber movie.

3420
02:37:26,980 --> 02:37:28,200
I would not watch a streamer movie.

3421
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:33,220
Big difference there, huh?

3422
02:37:35,780 --> 02:37:39,320
Oh my gosh, we're already... We're all the way back to the survival knife.

3423
02:37:42,480 --> 02:37:42,960
V movie.

3424
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:48,460
Streamer movie would be cringe.

3425
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:49,840
Yeah, pretty much.

3426
02:37:57,080 --> 02:37:57,480
Yeah,

3427
02:38:02,840 --> 02:38:05,960
there is a VTuber anime.

3428
02:38:06,660 --> 02:38:08,040
I haven't watched... Oh, there's a couple.

3429
02:38:08,200 --> 02:38:08,740
Kind of.

3430
02:38:08,860 --> 02:38:09,340
You're right.

3431
02:38:09,480 --> 02:38:13,260
With your knife, you don't have to worry about it breaking no matter how much you swing it around.

3432
02:38:14,200 --> 02:38:15,820
So the important thing is durability.

3433
02:38:15,820 --> 02:38:18,040
Man, I gotta write this stuff down.

3434
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:18,280
See?

3435
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:20,660
I told you, Sigyn's taking notes.

3436
02:38:21,060 --> 02:38:22,560
Next time, I'll make you see if the matches and fish hooks go in the sheath instead.

3437
02:38:26,860 --> 02:38:27,740
Gone fishing.

3438
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:30,460
Oh my gosh.

3439
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:34,440
Um...

3440
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:38,240
Can't I... Oh, wait!

3441
02:38:39,580 --> 02:38:41,300
I can use the cigar, I forgot!

3442
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:44,740
Oh, but my health...

3443
02:38:45,500 --> 02:38:48,160
I don't think cigars are highly addictive, right?

3444
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:49,680
I think that's not real.

3445
02:38:51,540 --> 02:38:53,440
It doesn't give me so much...

3446
02:38:54,140 --> 02:38:54,640
Oh gosh.

3447
02:38:54,880 --> 02:38:55,480
Okay, hold on.

3448
02:38:56,760 --> 02:38:58,100
Let's try the sonar.

3449
02:38:58,160 --> 02:39:00,940
Wait, the sonar does animals sound waves.

3450
02:39:05,620 --> 02:39:06,140
Going

3451
02:39:10,100 --> 02:39:11,260
towards the red dot.

3452
02:39:12,360 --> 02:39:13,340
Motion detector.

3453
02:39:14,820 --> 02:39:15,260
Wow!

3454
02:39:16,200 --> 02:39:16,640
Wow!

3455
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:17,880
This cave is crawling.

3456
02:39:22,870 --> 02:39:24,310
I seriously can't see anything.

3457
02:39:26,370 --> 02:39:27,370
There are also torches.

3458
02:39:27,470 --> 02:39:28,750
Yeah, I just don't remember where...

3459
02:39:28,750 --> 02:39:29,310
I have to...

3460
02:39:29,310 --> 02:39:30,230
I can't see any...

3461
02:39:30,230 --> 02:39:32,490
I can't even get out of this room to check out the torches.

3462
02:39:34,650 --> 02:39:35,090
Um...

3463
02:39:35,550 --> 02:39:35,990
No!

3464
02:39:36,230 --> 02:39:38,750
I thought cigars don't have nicotine in them.

3465
02:39:38,910 --> 02:39:39,470
Am I wrong?

3466
02:39:42,490 --> 02:39:43,170
Oh, okay.

3467
02:39:43,250 --> 02:39:43,690
I'm in a wall.

3468
02:39:43,890 --> 02:39:44,490
All right.

3469
02:39:45,650 --> 02:39:46,090
Uh...

3470
02:39:46,090 --> 02:39:46,230
Okay.

3471
02:39:46,230 --> 02:39:47,550
This way.

3472
02:39:47,750 --> 02:39:48,590
This way.

3473
02:39:55,290 --> 02:39:56,490
This way.

3474
02:39:57,190 --> 02:39:58,230
This way.

3475
02:39:58,550 --> 02:39:59,150
This way.

3476
02:39:59,770 --> 02:40:00,610
This way.

3477
02:40:00,690 --> 02:40:00,910
This way.

3478
02:40:01,590 --> 02:40:03,090
Wait, am I back where I started?

3479
02:40:03,910 --> 02:40:04,710
This way.

3480
02:40:05,250 --> 02:40:05,850
Wait.

3481
02:40:05,970 --> 02:40:06,850
This way.

3482
02:40:06,950 --> 02:40:07,410
Wait.

3483
02:40:08,690 --> 02:40:09,550
This way.

3484
02:40:09,950 --> 02:40:11,430
This way.

3485
02:40:11,590 --> 02:40:12,190
Okay.

3486
02:40:12,850 --> 02:40:13,770
We're making progress.

3487
02:40:14,350 --> 02:40:15,230
This way.

3488
02:40:15,970 --> 02:40:16,570
This way.

3489
02:40:17,550 --> 02:40:18,150
This way.

3490
02:40:18,170 --> 02:40:20,770
Come on, snake!

3491
02:40:23,730 --> 02:40:24,690
Oh my gosh!

3492
02:40:25,250 --> 02:40:26,330
It's the things!

3493
02:40:28,330 --> 02:40:29,210
It's the glow!

3494
02:40:29,450 --> 02:40:29,910
It's the glow!

3495
02:40:35,770 --> 02:40:38,770
I see you've caught yourself a Kenyan mangrove crab.

3496
02:40:38,950 --> 02:40:39,550
Oh, I did, yeah.

3497
02:40:39,790 --> 02:40:42,750
The Kenyan mangrove crab is a land-going crab.

3498
02:40:42,990 --> 02:40:46,290
It lives in burrows dug near seashores and mangrove swamps.

3499
02:40:47,250 --> 02:40:51,150
It's not poisonous, but it might hurt a little if it attacks you with its pincers.

3500
02:40:51,410 --> 02:40:52,530
Treat it with caution.

3501
02:40:52,870 --> 02:40:53,650
Crab battle.

3502
02:40:53,970 --> 02:40:54,530
Got it.

3503
02:40:54,890 --> 02:40:56,910
So this thing must taste pretty good, huh?

3504
02:40:57,110 --> 02:40:57,350
Yeah.

3505
02:40:57,650 --> 02:40:59,110
Why do you say, must?

3506
02:40:59,350 --> 02:40:59,850
Because it's a crab.

3507
02:41:00,110 --> 02:41:01,090
It's a crab, isn't it?

3508
02:41:01,310 --> 02:41:02,110
It is.

3509
02:41:02,470 --> 02:41:04,250
And crabs are good to eat.

3510
02:41:04,350 --> 02:41:04,530
Yeah.

3511
02:41:04,870 --> 02:41:05,950
What's so good about them?

3512
02:41:06,310 --> 02:41:07,450
You don't like crab?

3513
02:41:08,030 --> 02:41:08,810
Not at all.

3514
02:41:08,910 --> 02:41:09,130
What?

3515
02:41:09,270 --> 02:41:09,790
Why not?

3516
02:41:10,450 --> 02:41:10,890
Why?

3517
02:41:11,350 --> 02:41:12,910
How can you eat those things?

3518
02:41:13,390 --> 02:41:15,450
They're all purple and yellow-striped.

3519
02:41:15,570 --> 02:41:16,270
And they stink.

3520
02:41:16,290 --> 02:41:17,250
They stink like cat pee.

3521
02:41:17,930 --> 02:41:18,410
What?

3522
02:41:19,010 --> 02:41:20,710
But that's just my opinion.

3523
02:41:20,970 --> 02:41:21,870
Don't listen to me.

3524
02:41:23,090 --> 02:41:24,090
Let's see here.

3525
02:41:24,470 --> 02:41:25,630
The guide says...

3526
02:41:25,630 --> 02:41:25,890
Wait, what?

3527
02:41:26,590 --> 02:41:27,350
No way.

3528
02:41:27,950 --> 02:41:29,350
It says they're delicious.

3529
02:41:30,710 --> 02:41:34,070
Well, if you want to eat one, then go right ahead, but count me out.

3530
02:41:34,770 --> 02:41:36,690
What do you mean it smells like cat pee?

3531
02:41:36,830 --> 02:41:37,470
Wait, what?

3532
02:41:39,790 --> 02:41:41,370
What crab is she talking about?

3533
02:41:43,410 --> 02:41:43,890
What?

3534
02:41:43,890 --> 02:41:43,970
What?

3535
02:41:44,790 --> 02:41:45,270
What?

3536
02:41:50,210 --> 02:41:51,750
She said it was yellow and purple?

3537
02:41:54,630 --> 02:41:55,950
It smells like cat pee.

3538
02:41:59,250 --> 02:42:00,390
Ammonia from the decay.

3539
02:42:03,710 --> 02:42:05,530
I see you cut yourself a rat.

3540
02:42:06,590 --> 02:42:13,050
The rats in that area are the descendants of the wild Norway rats that were domesticated by humans as pets and lab ants.

3541
02:42:13,130 --> 02:42:13,410
Wait, the mushroom!

3542
02:42:14,110 --> 02:42:16,390
They're not poisonous, and I don't think they'll live long.

3543
02:42:16,390 --> 02:42:17,050
They'll attack you.

3544
02:42:17,170 --> 02:42:20,070
But they're quick little creatures, so you might have a hard time catching them.

3545
02:42:20,070 --> 02:42:23,750
I was watching that pekoro clip like just the other day.

3546
02:42:24,070 --> 02:42:24,550
Snake.

3547
02:42:25,050 --> 02:42:25,530
Rat.

3548
02:42:26,110 --> 02:42:26,990
They're rats.

3549
02:42:27,490 --> 02:42:28,990
I know what they are.

3550
02:42:29,190 --> 02:42:30,610
Do they taste okay?

3551
02:42:31,550 --> 02:42:32,030
Okay.

3552
02:42:32,730 --> 02:42:33,210
Rat.

3553
02:42:33,210 --> 02:42:34,930
The guide says they're not that bad.

3554
02:42:35,370 --> 02:42:36,430
Good enough for me.

3555
02:42:39,250 --> 02:42:40,690
Good enough for me.

3556
02:42:41,750 --> 02:42:43,870
I see you found some Russian glow caps.

3557
02:42:43,950 --> 02:42:44,110
Here it is.

3558
02:42:44,230 --> 02:42:44,390
Here it is.

3559
02:42:44,390 --> 02:42:44,430
Here it is.

3560
02:42:44,570 --> 02:42:44,730
Here it is.

3561
02:42:44,730 --> 02:42:44,870
Here it is.

3562
02:42:45,210 --> 02:42:45,690
Here it is.

3563
02:42:45,690 --> 02:42:45,730
Here it is.

3564
02:42:45,730 --> 02:42:46,090
Here it is.

3565
02:42:46,390 --> 02:42:48,090
A mushroom glow cap is a kind of luminescent fungus.

3566
02:42:48,490 --> 02:42:50,550
A mushroom that glows in the dark.

3567
02:42:51,270 --> 02:42:53,710
Why would a mushroom glow in the dark?

3568
02:42:54,030 --> 02:42:56,490
It's bioluminescent, just like a firefly.

3569
02:42:56,670 --> 02:42:59,910
It uses the so-called luciferin-luciferase reaction.

3570
02:43:00,330 --> 02:43:01,010
Luciferin-luciferase.

3571
02:43:01,010 --> 02:43:09,450
To put it simply, luciferin reacts with luciferase in the presence of magnesium 2 plus ions, breaking it down into oxy-luciferin and carbon dioxide.

3572
02:43:09,450 --> 02:43:10,570
He's scratching his face.

3573
02:43:10,570 --> 02:43:11,330
He's so confused.

3574
02:43:11,790 --> 02:43:12,030
I'm never...

3575
02:43:12,030 --> 02:43:16,090
The carbon groups in the oxy-luciferin are initially in an electrical excited state.

3576
02:43:16,390 --> 02:43:19,430
I've never noticed that before.

3577
02:43:19,810 --> 02:43:21,070
Did you get all that?

3578
02:43:21,610 --> 02:43:22,430
Not really.

3579
02:43:23,710 --> 02:43:28,070
By the way, does that mushroom recharge your batteries when you eat it?

3580
02:43:28,470 --> 02:43:34,130
I mean, it seems like if you ate a glowing mushroom, it might recharge your batteries or something.

3581
02:43:34,850 --> 02:43:37,410
Snake, your batteries are organic batteries.

3582
02:43:37,690 --> 02:43:41,650
They produce electricity by utilizing the potential difference between cells.

3583
02:43:42,610 --> 02:43:46,010
Organic batteries are known for their highly efficient energy conversion.

3584
02:43:46,390 --> 02:43:50,450
But they still rely on chemical reactions between proteins and enzymes to...

3585
02:43:50,450 --> 02:43:51,930
So you're saying they'll get recharged.

3586
02:43:52,450 --> 02:43:53,630
Believe what you want.

3587
02:43:53,990 --> 02:43:54,410
Great.

3588
02:43:54,650 --> 02:43:55,210
Great.

3589
02:43:59,770 --> 02:44:01,710
He's so excited about it.

3590
02:44:02,210 --> 02:44:02,770
Eva.

3591
02:44:03,070 --> 02:44:04,550
Snake, are you all right?

3592
02:44:04,970 --> 02:44:06,490
Yeah, just barely.

3593
02:44:06,890 --> 02:44:08,770
What the hell were all those hornets?

3594
02:44:08,770 --> 02:44:09,370
She's 28.

3595
02:44:09,430 --> 02:44:11,810
Most likely that was the pain, one of the cobras.

3596
02:44:12,250 --> 02:44:13,630
I figured as much.

3597
02:44:13,790 --> 02:44:15,010
Are they tracking me?

3598
02:44:15,010 --> 02:44:16,330
I don't know.

3599
02:44:16,590 --> 02:44:18,850
The cobras only take orders from the boss.

3600
02:44:19,570 --> 02:44:22,070
Not even Volgin knows what they're really up to.

3601
02:44:22,190 --> 02:44:24,010
So I don't know anything about them either.

3602
02:44:24,230 --> 02:44:24,870
They're just chilling.

3603
02:44:25,210 --> 02:44:26,230
They're just freaky guys.

3604
02:44:26,830 --> 02:44:28,070
Literally the freak circus.

3605
02:44:28,490 --> 02:44:30,130
You just focus on moving ahead.

3606
02:44:31,070 --> 02:44:35,230
Go to the end of the cave and you'll come out in an aqueduct overgrown with mangroves.

3607
02:44:35,690 --> 02:44:35,910
Okay.

3608
02:44:36,030 --> 02:44:37,970
This leads to the Ponyzovye Swamp.

3609
02:44:38,290 --> 02:44:38,770
Ponyzovye.

3610
02:44:38,930 --> 02:44:41,210
And Snake, be careful.

3611
02:44:42,170 --> 02:44:43,530
She's from Idaho?

3612
02:44:45,830 --> 02:44:46,910
So random.

3613
02:44:47,070 --> 02:44:49,150
Any Meridian, Idaho people here?

3614
02:44:49,590 --> 02:44:53,650
You are living in a legendary location.

3615
02:44:54,550 --> 02:44:57,990
I heard there's some emergency torches stored somewhere in that cave.

3616
02:44:58,250 --> 02:44:58,670
Yeah, where?

3617
02:44:59,190 --> 02:44:59,730
Torches.

3618
02:44:59,870 --> 02:45:00,490
Got it.

3619
02:45:00,570 --> 02:45:01,610
So where are they?

3620
02:45:01,690 --> 02:45:01,930
Yeah.

3621
02:45:02,410 --> 02:45:03,230
What do you mean?

3622
02:45:03,310 --> 02:45:04,290
Where are the torches?

3623
02:45:04,830 --> 02:45:05,990
How should I know?

3624
02:45:06,110 --> 02:45:07,170
Go find them yourself.

3625
02:45:07,530 --> 02:45:07,790
Eva!

3626
02:45:09,650 --> 02:45:12,250
Alright, let's eat a mushroom.

3627
02:45:13,830 --> 02:45:16,410
Let's recharge our battery, you guys.

3628
02:45:17,890 --> 02:45:18,690
The Bokomomokos.

3629
02:45:18,890 --> 02:45:19,830
I wish I had more of those.

3630
02:45:19,950 --> 02:45:20,410
Look at the rats.

3631
02:45:22,090 --> 02:45:22,890
The Bokomomokos.

3632
02:45:23,150 --> 02:45:23,950
Wait, what does it say?

3633
02:45:24,070 --> 02:45:25,350
Said to recharge the battery.

3634
02:45:30,520 --> 02:45:31,860
Battery has recovered.

3635
02:45:37,080 --> 02:45:38,860
Apparently the Bokomomokos taste bad.

3636
02:45:38,980 --> 02:45:39,720
No way, really?

3637
02:45:40,260 --> 02:45:42,200
Oh wait, I do remember Snake saying that, right?

3638
02:45:42,320 --> 02:45:43,280
Even though they're like a fruit?

3639
02:45:44,060 --> 02:45:44,460
She's a snake.

3640
02:45:44,480 --> 02:45:45,260
She's a snake.

3641
02:45:45,260 --> 02:45:45,620
What's up?

3642
02:45:46,760 --> 02:45:47,740
You were right.

3643
02:45:48,100 --> 02:45:48,880
About what?

3644
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:52,180
I ate a Russian glow cap and it charged up my batteries.

3645
02:45:52,520 --> 02:45:52,980
Huh?

3646
02:45:54,380 --> 02:45:55,080
What's wrong?

3647
02:45:55,860 --> 02:45:56,380
I...

3648
02:45:57,400 --> 02:45:57,920
That's...

3649
02:45:57,920 --> 02:45:58,600
That's great.

3650
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:00,520
Um...

3651
02:46:00,520 --> 02:46:02,460
Snake, can you excuse me for a second?

3652
02:46:02,820 --> 02:46:03,220
Sure.

3653
02:46:04,040 --> 02:46:05,460
Did you just hear that?

3654
02:46:05,980 --> 02:46:06,500
Yeah.

3655
02:46:06,900 --> 02:46:10,780
There's no way eating a bioluminescent mushroom would cause your batteries to recharge.

3656
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:11,580
I mean...

3657
02:46:11,580 --> 02:46:12,820
What do you think it means?

3658
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:14,300
Beast meat.

3659
02:46:14,300 --> 02:46:14,460
Beast meat?

3660
02:46:14,480 --> 02:46:15,620
Maybe it's all in his mind.

3661
02:46:15,700 --> 02:46:17,260
The power of the mind...

3662
02:46:17,260 --> 02:46:18,040
You mean like a placebo effect?

3663
02:46:18,220 --> 02:46:18,780
...is strong.

3664
02:46:19,060 --> 02:46:19,740
Why not?

3665
02:46:19,980 --> 02:46:21,360
You've seen how gullible he is.

3666
02:46:21,780 --> 02:46:22,820
He's not gullible!

3667
02:46:23,880 --> 02:46:25,420
Should we let him keep believing it?

3668
02:46:25,940 --> 02:46:27,000
Sounds good to me.

3669
02:46:27,100 --> 02:46:27,460
What?

3670
02:46:28,180 --> 02:46:28,900
Okay, Snake.

3671
02:46:29,080 --> 02:46:29,500
I'm back.

3672
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:30,920
Yes.

3673
02:46:31,160 --> 02:46:33,340
The Russian glow cap is a glowing mushroom.

3674
02:46:33,540 --> 02:46:35,600
So it'll recharge your batteries when you eat it.

3675
02:46:37,860 --> 02:46:39,100
The head tilt!

3676
02:46:39,480 --> 02:46:40,800
The head tilt!

3677
02:46:41,840 --> 02:46:43,400
Oh, he's so cute.

3678
02:46:43,540 --> 02:46:44,000
Oh, he's so cute.

3679
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:44,040
Oh, he's so cute.

3680
02:46:44,040 --> 02:46:44,080
Oh, he's so cute.

3681
02:46:44,800 --> 02:46:45,860
What a guy.

3682
02:46:46,740 --> 02:46:48,240
What a guy.

3683
02:46:52,680 --> 02:46:53,540
Motion D.

3684
02:46:55,360 --> 02:46:57,620
Let's see what animals we got in here.

3685
02:46:58,680 --> 02:46:59,320
Oh!

3686
02:46:59,400 --> 02:47:00,320
A grenade!

3687
02:47:01,380 --> 02:47:02,380
The bullet!

3688
02:47:04,260 --> 02:47:04,900
Uh...

3689
02:47:06,460 --> 02:47:07,700
I'm running somewhere?

3690
02:47:07,960 --> 02:47:08,380
Oh gosh.

3691
02:47:08,640 --> 02:47:09,740
This is so...

3692
02:47:09,740 --> 02:47:10,540
What the hell?

3693
02:47:11,440 --> 02:47:13,060
Why is the wall warm?

3694
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:14,260
Look at his head!

3695
02:47:14,520 --> 02:47:15,340
Oh my god!

3696
02:47:15,480 --> 02:47:16,120
Oh my god!

3697
02:47:20,700 --> 02:47:24,040
There is gotta be some heat on that headband.

3698
02:47:24,160 --> 02:47:25,920
Are you telling me that there's...

3699
02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:29,200
That the headband is just like made of ice?

3700
02:47:29,420 --> 02:47:30,100
What is this?

3701
02:47:32,340 --> 02:47:34,980
It's cutting off the blood circulation.

3702
02:47:35,700 --> 02:47:37,240
What is this for real?

3703
02:47:40,760 --> 02:47:42,320
It's not hot at all.

3704
02:47:42,660 --> 02:47:44,560
There's nothing going on in there.

3705
02:47:47,340 --> 02:47:50,760
Yeah, I could have really used that this summer, for real.

3706
02:47:51,940 --> 02:47:52,420
Okay.

3707
02:47:52,780 --> 02:47:53,560
Oh, what's this?

3708
02:47:53,740 --> 02:47:53,900
Oh.

3709
02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:56,080
Some crabs, maybe?

3710
02:47:56,580 --> 02:47:58,340
Is this where we first started, you think?

3711
02:47:58,880 --> 02:48:01,340
I'm trying to see if I can like...

3712
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:03,560
Follow where animals are.

3713
02:48:06,060 --> 02:48:08,380
Okay, we're going somewhere, maybe?

3714
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:09,760
Maybe not?

3715
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:11,480
Okay.

3716
02:48:18,370 --> 02:48:19,190
Is this it?

3717
02:48:19,350 --> 02:48:19,650
Okay.

3718
02:48:20,270 --> 02:48:22,150
I think this is where I just came from, right?

3719
02:48:23,090 --> 02:48:24,250
With the Russian...

3720
02:48:25,490 --> 02:48:26,170
Glow caps.

3721
02:48:26,750 --> 02:48:27,610
Or maybe not.

3722
02:48:28,430 --> 02:48:29,450
Maybe this is different.

3723
02:48:33,720 --> 02:48:34,160
Yes!

3724
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:36,360
This is where I just was!

3725
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:36,880
No!

3726
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:41,660
Snake always keeps a cool head in battle.

3727
02:48:42,220 --> 02:48:43,100
Check your map?

3728
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:46,000
I'm gonna be honest.

3729
02:48:47,140 --> 02:48:49,080
I 100% forgot I had a map.

3730
02:48:51,060 --> 02:48:51,620
I...

3731
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:54,860
100% forgot I had a map.

3732
02:48:57,320 --> 02:48:57,880
100%.

3733
02:48:59,180 --> 02:48:59,900
Thank you.

3734
02:49:01,460 --> 02:49:02,020
Same.

3735
02:49:03,940 --> 02:49:05,000
There's a map?

3736
02:49:09,380 --> 02:49:12,480
I 100% forgot there's a map here.

3737
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:13,520
Holy moly.

3738
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:17,240
Okay, so now we go over this way.

3739
02:49:20,480 --> 02:49:21,220
Like over here.

3740
02:49:21,540 --> 02:49:23,460
Right, not in front of me, but...

3741
02:49:24,740 --> 02:49:25,780
Okay, a little over.

3742
02:49:28,320 --> 02:49:28,680
Ow!

3743
02:49:28,740 --> 02:49:30,320
No, this map is not useless at all!

3744
02:49:30,360 --> 02:49:31,000
What are you talking about?

3745
02:49:33,620 --> 02:49:34,540
It's so helpful!

3746
02:49:35,060 --> 02:49:35,980
We found the area!

3747
02:49:37,780 --> 02:49:38,560
Do you think...

3748
02:49:38,960 --> 02:49:40,040
Did I miss...

3749
02:49:40,040 --> 02:49:40,560
Okay, hold on.

3750
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:41,560
Before we go in there...

3751
02:49:41,560 --> 02:49:43,280
There's like this whole...

3752
02:49:45,120 --> 02:49:48,720
There's like this whole big blobby room right down there.

3753
02:49:51,140 --> 02:49:51,840
Sorry, hold on.

3754
02:49:51,880 --> 02:49:52,900
I know I keep having to open it.

3755
02:49:53,020 --> 02:49:54,280
I just want to make sure I'm going the right way.

3756
02:49:54,980 --> 02:49:56,000
Okay, to the other side.

3757
02:49:56,920 --> 02:49:59,300
It says I've been in there, but...

3758
02:50:03,320 --> 02:50:03,680
No!

3759
02:50:03,680 --> 02:50:04,340
No, no!

3760
02:50:04,440 --> 02:50:05,060
Turn around!

3761
02:50:11,940 --> 02:50:13,600
Did you see the Blair Witch Project?

3762
02:50:15,220 --> 02:50:16,800
I don't think I've ever...

3763
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:18,920
I think I've actually only seen it once.

3764
02:50:22,680 --> 02:50:23,320
I'm lost.

3765
02:50:23,880 --> 02:50:25,340
I have a map, but I'm lost.

3766
02:50:25,740 --> 02:50:27,060
I have a map, but I'm lost.

3767
02:50:27,060 --> 02:50:27,120
This room?

3768
02:50:27,340 --> 02:50:28,220
That's what I'm trying to see.

3769
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:31,800
If the torches are in this blobby room.

3770
02:50:32,860 --> 02:50:33,260
Okay.

3771
02:50:37,460 --> 02:50:38,840
Wait, am I in the blobby room?

3772
02:50:39,040 --> 02:50:39,680
I thought I...

3773
02:50:42,080 --> 02:50:43,260
That's where I fell down?

3774
02:50:48,080 --> 02:50:48,480
Understandable.

3775
02:50:48,560 --> 02:50:48,900
Okay.

3776
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:53,120
We'll keep onwards then.

3777
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:54,540
Is it through here?

3778
02:50:56,540 --> 02:50:58,800
Me opening this damn map every two seconds?

3779
02:50:58,920 --> 02:50:59,220
Okay, yes.

3780
02:50:59,320 --> 02:50:59,480
Okay.

3781
02:51:00,580 --> 02:51:01,560
Torches on the left side.

3782
02:51:01,660 --> 02:51:01,680
Ah!

3783
02:51:01,840 --> 02:51:02,520
I can see!

3784
02:51:04,100 --> 02:51:04,940
Oh my gosh.

3785
02:51:04,980 --> 02:51:05,480
I can see.

3786
02:51:05,560 --> 02:51:06,060
I can see.

3787
02:51:07,020 --> 02:51:07,960
Oh my gosh.

3788
02:51:08,600 --> 02:51:10,320
Why is this like amnesia?

3789
02:51:11,180 --> 02:51:12,480
Why are there just some...

3790
02:51:13,960 --> 02:51:14,960
A torch!

3791
02:51:18,660 --> 02:51:20,720
Light or put out fire with the square.

3792
02:51:22,500 --> 02:51:23,280
And... Oh!

3793
02:51:28,060 --> 02:51:28,560
Mushroom!

3794
02:51:31,800 --> 02:51:32,160
Mushroom!

3795
02:51:32,480 --> 02:51:33,320
Time for mushrooms!

3796
02:51:33,320 --> 02:51:43,290
Mushroom, mushroom, get the 어�後 Mush!

3797
02:51:49,810 --> 02:51:50,150
Random mushrooms!

3798
02:51:50,370 --> 02:51:50,530
sizes!

3799
02:51:59,410 --> 02:51:59,530
Mushroom!

3800
02:52:01,070 --> 02:52:01,350
Mushroom!

3801
02:52:01,530 --> 02:52:01,810
Mushroom!

3802
02:52:02,790 --> 02:52:03,630
Mushroom!

3803
02:52:03,630 --> 02:52:04,010
It's not going to spoil.

3804
02:52:04,250 --> 02:52:04,930
No, it won't!

3805
02:52:08,530 --> 02:52:09,690
We can see!

3806
02:52:10,090 --> 02:52:10,710
We can see!

3807
02:52:14,330 --> 02:52:15,810
We can see!

3808
02:52:16,070 --> 02:52:16,670
We can see!

3809
02:52:18,790 --> 02:52:19,830
This way.

3810
02:52:24,490 --> 02:52:25,010
Okay,

3811
02:52:29,810 --> 02:52:30,850
give me one second.

3812
02:52:31,610 --> 02:52:32,650
Before we do that.

3813
02:52:38,230 --> 02:52:38,870
Actually, yeah.

3814
02:52:39,010 --> 02:52:39,750
I'll go do that.

3815
02:52:42,270 --> 02:52:42,990
We're saved!

3816
02:52:43,490 --> 02:52:44,590
We got the torch.

3817
02:52:44,870 --> 02:52:45,450
Everything's good.

3818
02:52:45,570 --> 02:52:46,130
Everything's fine.

3819
02:52:53,780 --> 02:52:54,560
Where is the blob?

3820
02:52:54,660 --> 02:52:55,280
Is this the blob area?

3821
02:52:57,400 --> 02:52:58,180
Is this where I fell?

3822
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:00,360
Oh, there it is!

3823
02:53:00,820 --> 02:53:01,500
Ah, my nose.

3824
02:53:02,140 --> 02:53:02,840
Wait, what's here?

3825
02:53:03,400 --> 02:53:05,960
Wait, this is the other one that I went down before, right?

3826
02:53:08,300 --> 02:53:09,680
No, this is a secret.

3827
02:53:17,470 --> 02:53:18,190
What's in here?

3828
02:53:18,390 --> 02:53:18,890
What are those?

3829
02:53:20,770 --> 02:53:21,530
What are these?

3830
02:53:22,470 --> 02:53:22,910
Frogs?

3831
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:29,960
Okay...

3832
02:53:31,620 --> 02:53:33,100
Let's check over here first.

3833
02:53:34,060 --> 02:53:34,960
Did you win yet?

3834
02:53:35,100 --> 02:53:35,380
Yep!

3835
02:53:39,780 --> 02:53:41,440
I had a feeling that would happen.

3836
02:53:41,580 --> 02:53:43,000
I don't think I can climb that.

3837
02:53:45,500 --> 02:53:47,920
I don't see anything at the bottom.

3838
02:53:48,020 --> 02:53:49,820
Actually, I'm going to be a genius real quick.

3839
02:53:51,680 --> 02:53:53,900
Can you imagine if that, like, electrocuted you?

3840
02:53:54,040 --> 02:53:55,300
There are things at the bottom!

3841
02:54:00,600 --> 02:54:01,240
Oh, my God.

3842
02:54:07,280 --> 02:54:08,120
Oh, my God.

3843
02:54:08,980 --> 02:54:10,360
Stuff that I don't even need!

3844
02:54:16,900 --> 02:54:18,160
I thought I was a genius.

3845
02:54:20,360 --> 02:54:21,240
I really thought.

3846
02:54:21,420 --> 02:54:22,680
I know there's a hole here.

3847
02:54:23,060 --> 02:54:23,980
I guess we'll go through.

3848
02:54:24,480 --> 02:54:25,860
I can't remember where it goes to.

3849
02:54:28,380 --> 02:54:30,120
Apparently, this is Phantom Pain.

3850
02:54:30,320 --> 02:54:31,980
I mean, look who's playing.

3851
02:54:33,200 --> 02:54:34,220
I'm a phantom.

3852
02:54:34,320 --> 02:54:34,920
I'm in pain.

3853
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:36,500
Have a nice day.

3854
02:54:37,700 --> 02:54:37,820
.

3855
02:54:50,120 --> 02:54:50,680
.

3856
02:54:50,680 --> 02:54:51,040
.

3857
02:54:52,380 --> 02:54:52,940
.

3858
02:54:58,680 --> 02:55:00,020
What is here?

3859
02:55:12,470 --> 02:55:14,310
Is that a ration?

3860
02:55:16,610 --> 02:55:18,430
There's like a frog touching me.

3861
02:55:23,060 --> 02:55:24,020
Oh my gosh.

3862
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:26,500
Ration!

3863
02:55:27,640 --> 02:55:29,060
My food is full!

3864
02:55:29,060 --> 02:55:29,140
Woah!

3865
02:55:35,460 --> 02:55:36,260
Look up.

3866
02:55:42,860 --> 02:55:43,760
We're in a hole.

3867
02:55:44,980 --> 02:55:46,020
Oh my god, the sun!

3868
02:55:52,310 --> 02:55:55,090
But we can't do anything in here, so...

3869
02:56:01,880 --> 02:56:04,480
Oh, do you think the keroutan is in this area?

3870
02:56:05,360 --> 02:56:05,760
Oh,

3871
02:56:09,240 --> 02:56:09,860
the sun is here too.

3872
02:56:11,040 --> 02:56:12,360
Keroutan is like in one of these.

3873
02:56:12,880 --> 02:56:13,340
I know it.

3874
02:56:22,300 --> 02:56:24,280
As a ghost, aren't you like allergic to the sun?

3875
02:56:24,320 --> 02:56:24,980
I'm not a vampire!

3876
02:56:27,020 --> 02:56:28,400
Ghosts can't go out in the sun!

3877
02:56:30,240 --> 02:56:33,560
It's a common misconception that ghosts only show up at night.

3878
02:56:33,820 --> 02:56:37,400
I mean, we're around all the time.

3879
02:56:41,040 --> 02:56:42,320
Yeah, I hate garlic.

3880
02:56:43,200 --> 02:56:44,040
What is that?

3881
02:56:48,080 --> 02:56:49,380
What is that on the ground?

3882
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:52,700
It's a...

3883
02:56:52,700 --> 02:56:52,780
Hoop?

3884
02:57:05,620 --> 02:57:06,620
It was...

3885
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:10,440
This one.

3886
02:57:24,330 --> 02:57:25,010
This one.

3887
02:57:35,160 --> 02:57:36,140
Oh my god!

3888
02:57:36,400 --> 02:57:37,940
I didn't even notice there was... oh wait.

3889
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:38,460
I was right.

3890
02:57:42,200 --> 02:57:43,920
Why didn't you attack me before?

3891
02:57:46,300 --> 02:57:47,140
I was right.

3892
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:48,600
You guys.

3893
02:57:49,560 --> 02:57:50,500
I was correct.

3894
02:57:50,500 --> 02:57:50,600
Correct.

3895
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:54,940
Let's go to the other one, because... yeah.

3896
02:57:55,160 --> 02:57:56,160
There's a little wall.

3897
02:57:56,320 --> 02:57:57,060
I remember now.

3898
02:58:01,240 --> 02:58:01,760
Here.

3899
02:58:03,180 --> 02:58:03,700
Yes.

3900
02:58:04,820 --> 02:58:05,800
Why are there skeletons?

3901
02:58:05,940 --> 02:58:06,400
People die!

3902
02:58:07,440 --> 02:58:08,300
All the time.

3903
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:09,520
Oh.

3904
02:58:11,660 --> 02:58:14,500
I didn't necessarily want to fall down here.

3905
02:58:15,480 --> 02:58:16,380
But we did.

3906
02:58:17,020 --> 02:58:17,880
No way.

3907
02:58:18,780 --> 02:58:20,860
It took me all the way back here!

3908
02:58:21,420 --> 02:58:22,660
Oh my gosh.

3909
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,040
It wasn't even anything that special.

3910
02:58:25,940 --> 02:58:26,380
Glowberry.

3911
02:58:30,720 --> 02:58:32,100
My food is full!

3912
02:58:32,380 --> 02:58:33,020
Wait, what's this one?

3913
02:58:33,180 --> 02:58:33,680
Oh, battery!

3914
02:58:33,900 --> 02:58:34,540
Actual battery.

3915
02:58:37,680 --> 02:58:39,300
It's OK, because we can eat.

3916
02:58:40,220 --> 02:58:41,200
We can eat up.

3917
02:58:41,240 --> 02:58:42,040
Eat up, eat up, eat up.

3918
02:58:42,560 --> 02:58:44,040
Eat up, eat up, eat up, eat up.

3919
02:58:44,180 --> 02:58:45,220
Let's taste the bread.

3920
02:58:47,920 --> 02:58:48,360
OK.

3921
02:58:48,360 --> 02:58:48,800
Bread.

3922
02:58:50,860 --> 02:58:51,860
What did he say about it?

3923
02:58:51,920 --> 02:58:52,380
Pretty good?

3924
02:58:55,700 --> 02:59:00,380
I'm going to buy the $240 Jetstream Sam Sword Replica Man.

3925
02:59:00,460 --> 02:59:00,820
No!

3926
02:59:03,080 --> 02:59:03,840
That's mine!

3927
02:59:06,240 --> 02:59:06,680
Wait.

3928
02:59:07,640 --> 02:59:08,080
$200?

3929
02:59:09,060 --> 02:59:10,780
Why is there so much cheaper?

3930
02:59:11,760 --> 02:59:13,340
Where did you find it for $200?

3931
02:59:17,710 --> 02:59:18,490
Wait a second.

3932
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:24,460
Where did you find it for $200?

3933
02:59:39,170 --> 02:59:40,350
I found one.

3934
02:59:40,770 --> 02:59:43,070
But it's like way more expensive.

3935
02:59:48,890 --> 02:59:49,450
OK.

3936
02:59:49,550 --> 02:59:50,990
Time to go all the way back.

3937
02:59:51,330 --> 02:59:52,450
All the way back.

3938
02:59:53,490 --> 02:59:54,050
Alrighty.

3939
02:59:54,370 --> 02:59:55,090
Don't fall.

3940
02:59:55,490 --> 02:59:56,690
I learned my lesson.

3941
02:59:58,730 --> 03:00:00,310
Exploring doesn't pay, you guys.

3942
03:00:02,310 --> 03:00:03,630
Yes, it does.

3943
03:00:03,850 --> 03:00:04,390
Just kidding.

3944
03:00:04,850 --> 03:00:05,810
Exploring pays!

3945
03:00:05,990 --> 03:00:06,930
Exploring pays!

3946
03:00:14,780 --> 03:00:15,220
Frog.

3947
03:00:15,220 --> 03:00:16,580
I can't attack with him.

3948
03:00:24,460 --> 03:00:24,900
Frog.

3949
03:00:32,540 --> 03:00:34,120
Is this where all the crabs are?

3950
03:00:34,300 --> 03:00:35,320
That I got to fight?

3951
03:00:35,680 --> 03:00:36,760
The little pinchers?

3952
03:00:37,680 --> 03:00:38,620
Oh my gosh!

3953
03:00:42,690 --> 03:00:44,610
Why is it so hard to find my knife?

3954
03:00:46,950 --> 03:00:48,130
Yeah, don't come towards me.

3955
03:00:58,480 --> 03:01:00,120
Is this Nutty Putty Cave?

3956
03:01:00,220 --> 03:01:00,940
I sure hope so.

3957
03:01:07,760 --> 03:01:08,200
Serum.

3958
03:01:14,040 --> 03:01:14,480
Cool.

3959
03:01:15,960 --> 03:01:16,720
Oh, OK.

3960
03:01:16,820 --> 03:01:17,900
We'll be coming to here later.

3961
03:01:19,400 --> 03:01:20,460
Anything else up here?

3962
03:01:21,140 --> 03:01:22,040
A little bit, yeah.

3963
03:01:23,720 --> 03:01:24,480
Anything else?

3964
03:01:24,540 --> 03:01:24,660
No.

3965
03:01:26,100 --> 03:01:26,980
Nutty Putty Cave.

3966
03:01:29,360 --> 03:01:30,520
Would you guys...

3967
03:01:33,480 --> 03:01:35,980
Would you guys do cave diving?

3968
03:01:37,640 --> 03:01:38,880
You'll end up like this guy.

3969
03:01:39,980 --> 03:01:40,720
Not Snake.

3970
03:01:40,980 --> 03:01:42,100
The one in the bottom right.

3971
03:01:43,840 --> 03:01:44,520
Not me.

3972
03:01:48,440 --> 03:01:50,400
You'll end up dead.

3973
03:01:51,300 --> 03:01:52,460
Like that other guy.

3974
03:01:57,860 --> 03:01:59,340
But also not me.

3975
03:02:01,940 --> 03:02:02,480
You'll end up dead.

3976
03:02:02,480 --> 03:02:02,940
End up like Minto.

3977
03:02:03,240 --> 03:02:04,060
Pika Minto.

3978
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:12,180
There was stuff in the other cave that we didn't check yet.

3979
03:02:14,340 --> 03:02:15,740
Should we go back?

3980
03:02:16,100 --> 03:02:17,140
Should we go back?

3981
03:02:18,280 --> 03:02:19,640
This can't all be secret.

3982
03:02:23,260 --> 03:02:23,780
Right?

3983
03:02:34,330 --> 03:02:35,290
Big ol' snake.

3984
03:02:35,750 --> 03:02:36,470
Oh, bats?

3985
03:02:39,050 --> 03:02:39,990
Don't wanna eat those.

3986
03:02:41,390 --> 03:02:42,210
Who's attacking me?

3987
03:02:45,750 --> 03:02:46,670
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3988
03:02:46,730 --> 03:02:48,370
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3989
03:02:48,470 --> 03:02:48,930
Let's go back.

3990
03:02:49,490 --> 03:02:50,190
Let's go back.

3991
03:02:50,250 --> 03:02:50,850
Let's go back.

3992
03:02:50,910 --> 03:02:51,430
Let's go back.

3993
03:02:53,770 --> 03:02:54,530
Let's go back.

3994
03:02:54,590 --> 03:02:55,070
Let's go back.

3995
03:02:55,190 --> 03:02:56,130
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

3996
03:02:56,230 --> 03:02:56,550
Not yet.

3997
03:02:56,690 --> 03:02:56,970
Not yet,

3998
03:03:00,390 --> 03:03:00,670
not yet.

3999
03:03:02,390 --> 03:03:03,590
No, not time for bees.

4000
03:03:03,650 --> 03:03:06,290
I wanna explore just a little tiny bit more.

4001
03:03:06,290 --> 03:03:07,190
If you guys are okay with it.

4002
03:03:14,570 --> 03:03:15,550
A shotgun.

4003
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:20,680
Nice.

4004
03:03:21,400 --> 03:03:23,480
Is there any suppressors in here?

4005
03:03:23,560 --> 03:03:24,560
Bats, leave me alone.

4006
03:03:24,960 --> 03:03:25,640
Don't they attack?

4007
03:03:28,680 --> 03:03:29,660
Leave me alone.

4008
03:03:29,860 --> 03:03:30,600
Leave me alone.

4009
03:03:36,600 --> 03:03:37,400
Here we go.

4010
03:03:38,260 --> 03:03:40,160
This must be where the crabs are.

4011
03:03:44,310 --> 03:03:44,830
Crabs.

4012
03:03:47,650 --> 03:03:48,850
Oh, crabs.

4013
03:03:54,010 --> 03:03:55,550
Where art thou, crab?

4014
03:03:57,470 --> 03:03:58,450
Snow uniform.

4015
03:04:00,450 --> 03:04:01,850
Use the sonar.

4016
03:04:03,590 --> 03:04:04,670
No, it's okay.

4017
03:04:05,730 --> 03:04:06,650
Ribbit, ribbit.

4018
03:04:07,870 --> 03:04:09,170
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.

4019
03:04:11,010 --> 03:04:11,610
Ribbit.

4020
03:04:14,050 --> 03:04:16,310
Any time snakes tell me growls...

4021
03:04:16,310 --> 03:04:16,450
Oh!

4022
03:04:17,130 --> 03:04:18,390
Mine does too, though.

4023
03:04:18,430 --> 03:04:19,230
Just a little bit.

4024
03:04:20,070 --> 03:04:20,670
Ah!

4025
03:04:22,750 --> 03:04:24,770
He came after me first.

4026
03:04:24,830 --> 03:04:25,570
It was self-defense.

4027
03:04:27,510 --> 03:04:28,630
That's self-defense.

4028
03:04:30,270 --> 03:04:31,710
Let's eat all of our food.

4029
03:04:33,430 --> 03:04:34,830
Let's eat all the stuff...

4030
03:04:35,370 --> 03:04:36,250
that we got.

4031
03:04:36,570 --> 03:04:37,350
What can I say?

4032
03:04:42,530 --> 03:04:44,190
That looks like a crab.

4033
03:04:46,230 --> 03:04:47,250
Crab battle!

4034
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:52,960
This cave is huge, man.

4035
03:04:54,260 --> 03:04:55,300
It's so...

4036
03:04:55,900 --> 03:04:56,420
big.

4037
03:04:59,320 --> 03:05:00,680
Where even are we?

4038
03:05:02,160 --> 03:05:04,340
I'm on a murdering spree.

4039
03:05:05,900 --> 03:05:07,480
I can't stop murdering crabs.

4040
03:05:17,900 --> 03:05:19,220
Where are we?

4041
03:05:19,440 --> 03:05:20,180
Oh, gosh.

4042
03:05:20,200 --> 03:05:20,640
The bats.

4043
03:05:22,720 --> 03:05:23,540
Leave me alone.

4044
03:05:24,760 --> 03:05:25,540
Leave me alone.

4045
03:05:26,260 --> 03:05:26,940
Hold on.

4046
03:05:27,340 --> 03:05:27,860
Okay.

4047
03:05:27,940 --> 03:05:28,400
Never mind.

4048
03:05:28,420 --> 03:05:29,320
My eyes deceived me.

4049
03:05:29,340 --> 03:05:30,060
I thought that was a way up.

4050
03:05:30,500 --> 03:05:31,020
Oh, gosh.

4051
03:05:33,260 --> 03:05:33,960
I was so blew away.

4052
03:05:33,960 --> 03:05:34,340
Leave me alone.

4053
03:05:34,580 --> 03:05:35,040
How am I...

4054
03:05:35,040 --> 03:05:36,040
I haven't gone through here before.

4055
03:05:37,220 --> 03:05:38,820
I have not.

4056
03:05:39,080 --> 03:05:39,560
I have!

4057
03:05:40,480 --> 03:05:41,760
It's a big old loop.

4058
03:05:41,940 --> 03:05:42,600
That's it.

4059
03:05:45,540 --> 03:05:46,820
We've been bamboozled.

4060
03:05:49,620 --> 03:05:53,600
But there was that one area we didn't go to.

4061
03:06:06,340 --> 03:06:06,820
Okay,

4062
03:06:11,380 --> 03:06:12,460
we have literally nothing.

4063
03:06:12,700 --> 03:06:14,860
Um, what haven't we gotten in the caves?

4064
03:06:14,920 --> 03:06:16,140
We haven't gotten the bats?

4065
03:06:20,740 --> 03:06:22,280
I guess I can get one now.

4066
03:06:22,840 --> 03:06:23,580
Come here, bat!

4067
03:06:30,140 --> 03:06:30,640
Bat!

4068
03:06:31,720 --> 03:06:32,460
Come here, bat!

4069
03:06:33,320 --> 03:06:35,760
How do I... Kill the bat!

4070
03:06:37,770 --> 03:06:38,450
Kill the bat!

4071
03:06:38,630 --> 03:06:39,370
Oh, there we go.

4072
03:06:39,690 --> 03:06:40,730
I wasn't even...

4073
03:06:40,730 --> 03:06:45,570
I was EQC-ing the bats instead of actually killing them.

4074
03:06:47,810 --> 03:06:49,310
I think I killed all the bats.

4075
03:06:53,270 --> 03:06:55,190
I think I killed all of them.

4076
03:06:56,350 --> 03:06:57,610
I'm going to...

4077
03:06:59,450 --> 03:07:00,450
Throw away...

4078
03:07:02,410 --> 03:07:05,930
We haven't eaten our crabs yet, but they're said to be tasty, so we'll keep it.

4079
03:07:06,010 --> 03:07:06,630
That was tasty.

4080
03:07:07,550 --> 03:07:08,870
The arowana's tasty.

4081
03:07:09,430 --> 03:07:11,770
We'll throw away the crocodile.

4082
03:07:13,270 --> 03:07:13,830
Goodbye.

4083
03:07:16,310 --> 03:07:16,870
Alright.

4084
03:07:18,390 --> 03:07:18,950
Paramedic!

4085
03:07:19,030 --> 03:07:19,990
I got a bat.

4086
03:07:22,350 --> 03:07:23,750
A vampire bat?

4087
03:07:25,730 --> 03:07:26,850
Ah, sucker.

4088
03:07:26,850 --> 03:07:27,010
Sucker.

4089
03:07:27,270 --> 03:07:27,730
Got it.

4090
03:07:28,150 --> 03:07:29,250
Speaking of bats...

4091
03:07:29,250 --> 03:07:30,250
Hey, I'm a freaker.

4092
03:07:30,250 --> 03:07:30,590
Just say it.

4093
03:07:31,050 --> 03:07:31,490
Huh?

4094
03:07:32,070 --> 03:07:34,450
I know you're going to talk about vampire movies.

4095
03:07:34,490 --> 03:07:35,230
Oh, that's right.

4096
03:07:35,490 --> 03:07:37,830
Attack of the Vampire Donuts, or Dracula vs.

4097
03:07:38,070 --> 03:07:39,990
the Space Hippos, or something like that.

4098
03:07:40,110 --> 03:07:40,190
I forgot.

4099
03:07:40,190 --> 03:07:41,150
He hates vampires.

4100
03:07:41,250 --> 03:07:45,690
Actually, I was going to say that bats are known to use supersonic waves to sense their surroundings.

4101
03:07:46,590 --> 03:07:47,030
He hates...

4102
03:07:47,030 --> 03:07:48,410
He hates the bats.

4103
03:07:48,470 --> 03:07:49,650
I mean, he hates the vampire.

4104
03:07:49,770 --> 03:07:54,350
Bats use supersonic waves to sense their surroundings, so you might be able to keep them away by blasting them with a special kind of sound wave.

4105
03:07:54,350 --> 03:07:59,970
Alternatively, you could try equipping a torch and waving it around with the CQC button.

4106
03:08:00,570 --> 03:08:04,930
As for taste, I suppose there's no reason you couldn't eat them.

4107
03:08:07,190 --> 03:08:09,470
Snake, do you hate vampire movies?

4108
03:08:09,770 --> 03:08:10,110
What?

4109
03:08:10,410 --> 03:08:12,670
Just now, you sounded like you really hated them.

4110
03:08:12,950 --> 03:08:13,490
I did?

4111
03:08:13,810 --> 03:08:14,370
Yeah.

4112
03:08:14,610 --> 03:08:15,170
Oh.

4113
03:08:15,550 --> 03:08:18,090
Well, no one really likes them, do they?

4114
03:08:18,170 --> 03:08:19,470
Some people do.

4115
03:08:19,730 --> 03:08:20,650
Like you.

4116
03:08:20,990 --> 03:08:21,550
Yeah.

4117
03:08:22,230 --> 03:08:23,850
They're fascinating, you know?

4118
03:08:23,850 --> 03:08:25,350
Like the movie Dracula.

4119
03:08:25,650 --> 03:08:26,810
Don't say it.

4120
03:08:26,830 --> 03:08:27,690
Why not?

4121
03:08:28,190 --> 03:08:29,830
Just don't.

4122
03:08:29,990 --> 03:08:31,170
Are you afraid?

4123
03:08:31,750 --> 03:08:32,350
What?

4124
03:08:32,850 --> 03:08:34,990
You're afraid of vampires, aren't you?

4125
03:08:35,110 --> 03:08:35,490
My body's afraid of vampires.

4126
03:08:35,490 --> 03:08:36,090
Don't be ridiculous.

4127
03:08:36,590 --> 03:08:37,190
But...

4128
03:08:37,570 --> 03:08:37,870
Listen.

4129
03:08:38,010 --> 03:08:40,070
There are no such things as vampires.

4130
03:08:40,170 --> 03:08:40,970
That's not what we said.

4131
03:08:41,330 --> 03:08:42,450
It's just a stupid made-up legend.

4132
03:08:43,010 --> 03:08:45,950
And if they do seem real sometimes...

4133
03:08:45,950 --> 03:08:46,790
Well, sure.

4134
03:08:47,250 --> 03:08:49,670
You think I'd be afraid of something like that?

4135
03:08:49,930 --> 03:08:50,330
No.

4136
03:08:50,510 --> 03:08:50,830
No.

4137
03:08:51,510 --> 03:08:52,110
Exactly.

4138
03:08:52,910 --> 03:08:53,430
Right.

4139
03:08:53,650 --> 03:08:57,730
Makes me wish there was, like, a vampire-like boss in this game.

4140
03:08:57,950 --> 03:09:03,430
It's just that whenever somebody starts talking about vampires, I end up dreaming about them that night.

4141
03:09:03,570 --> 03:09:05,550
I don't need that right now.

4142
03:09:05,570 --> 03:09:07,210
I don't need that.

4143
03:09:07,350 --> 03:09:11,610
I don't need that right now.

4144
03:09:13,770 --> 03:09:16,760
Oh, man.

4145
03:09:17,680 --> 03:09:19,100
What a silly guy.

4146
03:09:19,660 --> 03:09:20,660
So silly.

4147
03:09:23,060 --> 03:09:24,880
I don't need that right now.

4148
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:25,580
Oh, my bad.

4149
03:09:26,180 --> 03:09:26,820
There we go.

4150
03:09:34,960 --> 03:09:35,900
Let's go back.

4151
03:09:36,160 --> 03:09:36,440
Wait.

4152
03:09:36,540 --> 03:09:37,300
Hold on a second.

4153
03:09:37,520 --> 03:09:38,200
Checking my map.

4154
03:09:41,120 --> 03:09:41,560
Yeah.

4155
03:09:43,340 --> 03:09:45,600
So we haven't been down there.

4156
03:09:45,940 --> 03:09:47,000
Or we have.

4157
03:09:47,300 --> 03:09:47,520
No.

4158
03:09:50,840 --> 03:09:52,260
We gotta go back.

4159
03:09:52,380 --> 03:09:52,680
Wait.

4160
03:09:52,780 --> 03:09:53,460
What's over...

4161
03:09:53,960 --> 03:09:54,600
Yeah, yeah.

4162
03:09:54,640 --> 03:09:55,360
This is where we're going.

4163
03:09:55,500 --> 03:09:55,820
Wait.

4164
03:09:55,820 --> 03:09:55,980
Huh?

4165
03:09:56,360 --> 03:09:56,800
Wait.

4166
03:10:00,320 --> 03:10:03,520
This is why we never got an MGS Castlevania crossover.

4167
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:06,440
So...

4168
03:10:07,420 --> 03:10:08,300
This part...

4169
03:10:09,280 --> 03:10:10,160
Right here...

4170
03:10:10,700 --> 03:10:12,020
Isn't that where I just came from?

4171
03:10:12,900 --> 03:10:16,460
Maybe that's the exit to the...

4172
03:10:16,460 --> 03:10:17,400
Let's show it.

4173
03:10:20,620 --> 03:10:21,060
No.

4174
03:10:21,360 --> 03:10:23,240
The top is where we just came from.

4175
03:10:23,280 --> 03:10:23,400
Huh?

4176
03:10:27,570 --> 03:10:27,830
I'm so confused.

4177
03:10:28,030 --> 03:10:29,410
What is that area that's not explored?

4178
03:10:29,550 --> 03:10:30,430
But then also down here.

4179
03:10:30,590 --> 03:10:32,150
That big old blob we haven't explored.

4180
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:40,680
I'm lost.

4181
03:10:41,740 --> 03:10:42,480
I'm lost.

4182
03:10:42,780 --> 03:10:43,580
Oh, you didn't hear the chew.

4183
03:10:43,680 --> 03:10:44,020
Sorry.

4184
03:10:44,120 --> 03:10:45,600
It's because I have to...

4185
03:10:46,440 --> 03:10:47,920
Otherwise you'll get the double audio.

4186
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:50,140
So I keep it...

4187
03:10:50,140 --> 03:10:50,520
I...

4188
03:10:52,640 --> 03:10:53,560
Turn it off.

4189
03:10:54,240 --> 03:10:54,680
Sorry.

4190
03:10:54,880 --> 03:10:55,440
I can't.

4191
03:10:58,000 --> 03:10:58,980
I think he's alive.

4192
03:11:00,980 --> 03:11:01,760
Are you alive?

4193
03:11:01,760 --> 03:11:03,460
Are you gonna move?

4194
03:11:03,840 --> 03:11:05,040
I think he's dead.

4195
03:11:06,720 --> 03:11:07,600
He's alive!

4196
03:11:13,650 --> 03:11:14,930
Self-defense.

4197
03:11:15,430 --> 03:11:16,490
Self-defense.

4198
03:11:21,850 --> 03:11:24,750
I don't think technically we've gotten that guy either.

4199
03:11:25,710 --> 03:11:27,630
I don't wanna waste all my good food.

4200
03:11:31,680 --> 03:11:32,760
Little frog.

4201
03:11:33,800 --> 03:11:34,820
Little frog.

4202
03:11:34,860 --> 03:11:35,480
Little frog.

4203
03:11:36,940 --> 03:11:38,600
Little little little cave frog.

4204
03:11:41,380 --> 03:11:41,900
Alright.

4205
03:11:45,240 --> 03:11:46,920
Where... are we?

4206
03:11:48,240 --> 03:11:49,400
Where are we?

4207
03:11:59,470 --> 03:12:01,490
So there was another way to get close?

4208
03:12:11,030 --> 03:12:12,790
Let's just go the long way, I guess.

4209
03:12:13,430 --> 03:12:14,470
Which is this way?

4210
03:12:15,510 --> 03:12:16,690
I'm a little lost.

4211
03:12:20,330 --> 03:12:21,250
Wait a second!

4212
03:12:23,210 --> 03:12:23,410
Where?

4213
03:12:29,300 --> 03:12:30,580
This is where we dropped...

4214
03:12:30,580 --> 03:12:37,050
And I was headed this way and then I got distracted.

4215
03:12:39,550 --> 03:12:41,290
I was headed this way.

4216
03:12:41,550 --> 03:12:42,030
Right?

4217
03:12:42,130 --> 03:12:42,290
Wait.

4218
03:12:45,270 --> 03:12:46,210
Not this way.

4219
03:12:46,790 --> 03:12:48,410
I was headed the other direction.

4220
03:12:51,410 --> 03:12:52,410
Then I got lost.

4221
03:12:54,670 --> 03:12:55,990
I was headed this way.

4222
03:12:57,730 --> 03:12:58,690
Very clearly.

4223
03:13:00,170 --> 03:13:01,350
Then I was going this way.

4224
03:13:03,430 --> 03:13:03,850
Yes!

4225
03:13:07,950 --> 03:13:09,790
And then I wanted to go this way.

4226
03:13:09,950 --> 03:13:12,070
So this is... up here.

4227
03:13:13,430 --> 03:13:13,850
Yeah!

4228
03:13:14,390 --> 03:13:15,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4229
03:13:15,310 --> 03:13:16,470
This is where I wanted to go.

4230
03:13:16,610 --> 03:13:18,230
But then there's also this big blob here.

4231
03:13:18,950 --> 03:13:19,370
Okay.

4232
03:13:19,450 --> 03:13:20,050
We'll figure it out.

4233
03:13:23,720 --> 03:13:25,260
And there's some more...

4234
03:13:28,060 --> 03:13:29,020
Some more batteries.

4235
03:13:30,760 --> 03:13:31,160
Wait.

4236
03:13:31,320 --> 03:13:32,080
Can I even take this?

4237
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:33,860
I don't think I can.

4238
03:13:34,680 --> 03:13:35,080
No!

4239
03:13:36,120 --> 03:13:36,740
You know what?

4240
03:13:36,760 --> 03:13:37,000
It's fine.

4241
03:13:37,500 --> 03:13:38,580
We got enough, probably.

4242
03:13:42,710 --> 03:13:43,610
And here we go.

4243
03:13:46,230 --> 03:13:46,630
Okay.

4244
03:13:48,350 --> 03:13:48,750
Forward.

4245
03:13:51,290 --> 03:13:52,450
Not march crawl.

4246
03:13:53,470 --> 03:13:54,270
Forward crawl.

4247
03:13:56,870 --> 03:13:57,270
Oh.

4248
03:13:58,570 --> 03:13:59,310
Come at me.

4249
03:14:06,090 --> 03:14:06,530
Vampires.

4250
03:14:06,950 --> 03:14:07,390
Vampires.

4251
03:14:08,670 --> 03:14:09,110
Bisexuals.

4252
03:14:21,110 --> 03:14:21,810
Crab battle.

4253
03:14:21,870 --> 03:14:24,230
Why isn't it called bat battle?

4254
03:14:30,140 --> 03:14:31,260
What does this hold to?

4255
03:14:32,120 --> 03:14:34,580
This is literally spelunking down here.

4256
03:14:40,670 --> 03:14:41,850
Snake, you're getting deep.

4257
03:14:43,010 --> 03:14:44,150
You're getting in deep.

4258
03:14:44,330 --> 03:14:45,310
I'm scared for you.

4259
03:14:47,930 --> 03:14:48,930
Bat battle.

4260
03:14:50,310 --> 03:14:51,110
Here we go.

4261
03:14:52,950 --> 03:14:54,150
Crawling on through.

4262
03:14:55,350 --> 03:14:56,190
That's a crab.

4263
03:14:56,410 --> 03:14:57,330
Just avoid him.

4264
03:15:00,110 --> 03:15:01,430
Actually, was it a crab?

4265
03:15:02,870 --> 03:15:03,750
I might.

4266
03:15:03,810 --> 03:15:06,130
My eyes may have deceived me.

4267
03:15:07,830 --> 03:15:09,010
Where are we, Snake?

4268
03:15:11,450 --> 03:15:12,390
Where are we?

4269
03:15:13,250 --> 03:15:13,790
Context?

4270
03:15:13,830 --> 03:15:14,630
What do you mean, context?

4271
03:15:14,770 --> 03:15:15,510
For what?

4272
03:15:17,270 --> 03:15:18,230
Context for what?

4273
03:15:18,410 --> 03:15:19,470
Oh, and this is...

4274
03:15:20,550 --> 03:15:23,050
That big old blobby room I wanted to check out.

4275
03:15:26,950 --> 03:15:28,730
Oh, that's the hole!

4276
03:15:30,590 --> 03:15:31,490
Don't fall in.

4277
03:15:32,150 --> 03:15:33,950
Night vision goggles!

4278
03:15:35,770 --> 03:15:38,130
Now you guys can shut up about it.

4279
03:15:38,530 --> 03:15:39,310
Kettle time!

4280
03:15:39,310 --> 03:15:39,630
We're done!

4281
03:15:41,930 --> 03:15:42,370
Ribbit.

4282
03:15:44,370 --> 03:15:46,330
And then if you look up, there's the light.

4283
03:15:47,290 --> 03:15:48,690
Snake, you're looking a little pale.

4284
03:15:49,210 --> 03:15:50,550
You're looking a little like...

4285
03:15:50,550 --> 03:15:51,650
A vampire.

4286
03:15:55,530 --> 03:15:57,390
He's becoming his worst enemy.

4287
03:15:58,650 --> 03:16:02,350
Would it be faster to go all the way back or to fall through the hole, I wonder?

4288
03:16:04,030 --> 03:16:04,930
Fall through the hole.

4289
03:16:06,670 --> 03:16:07,110
Wee!

4290
03:16:20,290 --> 03:16:21,850
Alright, you guys ready?

4291
03:16:23,970 --> 03:16:25,530
You guys ready for some bees?

4292
03:16:28,430 --> 03:16:30,350
I remember this fight being...

4293
03:16:31,110 --> 03:16:32,190
Not the worst.

4294
03:16:33,350 --> 03:16:33,990
But...

4295
03:16:33,990 --> 03:16:35,810
Just a tad...

4296
03:16:36,690 --> 03:16:37,630
Annoying for me.

4297
03:16:37,870 --> 03:16:39,350
Because of my depth perception.

4298
03:16:41,030 --> 03:16:42,670
So I shall...

4299
03:16:43,310 --> 03:16:44,810
Do my best.

4300
03:16:56,860 --> 03:17:01,300
Fear all who see me.

4301
03:17:03,780 --> 03:17:04,740
Okay, here we go.

4302
03:17:10,530 --> 03:17:11,870
You got the shotgun.

4303
03:17:12,130 --> 03:17:12,990
It's useful.

4304
03:17:13,230 --> 03:17:14,890
And here's your water camo.

4305
03:17:15,070 --> 03:17:17,830
Have fun.

4306
03:17:17,930 --> 03:17:18,490
Thanks, Wes!

4307
03:17:19,650 --> 03:17:21,810
How much was the one that I found?

4308
03:17:22,990 --> 03:17:24,010
It was like...

4309
03:17:24,010 --> 03:17:25,010
It was in...

4310
03:17:25,010 --> 03:17:26,430
It was in Yen.

4311
03:17:26,750 --> 03:17:28,930
But in dollars, it was $500.

4312
03:17:30,850 --> 03:17:31,650
500 USD.

4313
03:17:31,950 --> 03:17:33,070
And I was like, this is...

4314
03:17:34,410 --> 03:17:35,570
I really want it.

4315
03:17:35,610 --> 03:17:37,090
But obviously, that's a lot of money.

4316
03:17:37,690 --> 03:17:38,950
So I've just been like...

4317
03:17:38,950 --> 03:17:40,110
I just have the tab open.

4318
03:17:40,270 --> 03:17:41,970
And I've just been looking at it every day.

4319
03:17:47,060 --> 03:17:48,720
I was just like, oh my gosh.

4320
03:17:48,720 --> 03:17:50,880
What if one day on stream, I just pulled it out?

4321
03:17:52,260 --> 03:17:53,520
I just whipped it out.

4322
03:17:53,600 --> 03:17:55,220
I was like, this isn't even my sword.

4323
03:17:56,240 --> 03:17:57,560
What if I just did that, you know?

4324
03:18:03,460 --> 03:18:03,840
Yeah.

4325
03:18:04,100 --> 03:18:05,700
Just casually whipped it out.

4326
03:18:06,500 --> 03:18:07,040
What if?

4327
03:18:15,570 --> 03:18:15,950
Yeah.

4328
03:18:18,590 --> 03:18:19,250
Well, it's expensive.

4329
03:18:19,310 --> 03:18:20,310
I found it's 300-ish.

4330
03:18:21,090 --> 03:18:21,470
Oh.

4331
03:18:21,590 --> 03:18:22,550
Well, it's also...

4332
03:18:22,550 --> 03:18:23,990
It seems to be...

4333
03:18:26,090 --> 03:18:26,710
What's the word?

4334
03:18:26,770 --> 03:18:27,690
It seems to be handmade.

4335
03:18:27,950 --> 03:18:29,390
Like, it seems to be like a cosplay prop.

4336
03:18:29,890 --> 03:18:30,270
So...

4337
03:18:32,810 --> 03:18:33,450
I don't know.

4338
03:18:33,910 --> 03:18:35,230
It looks really fancy, though.

4339
03:18:36,390 --> 03:18:37,910
I have no idea what it's made out of.

4340
03:18:38,010 --> 03:18:38,270
Is it...

4341
03:18:38,270 --> 03:18:38,670
Snake?

4342
03:18:38,890 --> 03:18:40,310
Have you heard of The Last War?

4343
03:18:40,430 --> 03:18:41,310
The Last War?

4344
03:18:41,390 --> 03:18:41,510
No.

4345
03:18:41,610 --> 03:18:42,530
It doesn't ring a bell.

4346
03:18:42,570 --> 03:18:43,330
I actually don't know this one.

4347
03:18:43,410 --> 03:18:46,050
It's a Japanese movie where the world ends in a nuclear war.

4348
03:18:46,230 --> 03:18:46,370
Oh.

4349
03:18:47,010 --> 03:18:49,530
Tensions between East and West reach the breaking point.

4350
03:18:49,650 --> 03:18:52,750
And before anyone can stop it, they launch the ICBMs.

4351
03:18:52,890 --> 03:18:53,270
Oh.

4352
03:18:53,850 --> 03:18:56,330
Humanity is wiped out by a war that no one wanted.

4353
03:18:56,410 --> 03:18:56,630
Oh.

4354
03:18:56,710 --> 03:18:59,670
The movie depicts that destruction from the eyes of ordinary people.

4355
03:18:59,910 --> 03:19:00,110
Oh.

4356
03:19:00,170 --> 03:19:00,250
I don't know.

4357
03:19:00,250 --> 03:19:05,590
Their simple daily lives are torn apart by the terrible power of a war that has nothing to do with them.

4358
03:19:06,470 --> 03:19:08,310
Everybody's afraid of the next big war.

4359
03:19:08,670 --> 03:19:11,410
But there's only so much that one person can do.

4360
03:19:12,290 --> 03:19:15,630
That's why the people who have the power to stop it have to.

4361
03:19:17,070 --> 03:19:17,550
The torrents.

4362
03:19:17,730 --> 03:19:18,110
Okay.

4363
03:19:19,450 --> 03:19:20,810
That got so serious.

4364
03:19:21,290 --> 03:19:22,550
That got so serious.

4365
03:19:23,590 --> 03:19:24,730
It was this way, right?

4366
03:19:24,830 --> 03:19:24,930
Yeah.

4367
03:19:25,990 --> 03:19:30,050
I love you.

4368
03:19:30,210 --> 03:19:31,210
Don't look.

4369
03:19:31,430 --> 03:19:31,910
I love you.

4370
03:19:31,910 --> 03:19:31,950
Don't look.

4371
03:19:31,950 --> 03:19:32,970
Don't look.

4372
03:19:35,590 --> 03:19:36,690
It's okay.

4373
03:19:37,690 --> 03:19:38,570
It's okay.

4374
03:19:39,230 --> 03:19:39,950
It's okay.

4375
03:19:41,830 --> 03:19:43,030
It's okay.

4376
03:19:47,130 --> 03:19:48,010
It's okay.

4377
03:19:48,550 --> 03:19:49,430
It's okay.

4378
03:19:49,590 --> 03:19:50,090
It's okay.

4379
03:19:50,330 --> 03:19:50,350
It's okay.

4380
03:19:50,670 --> 03:19:52,670
Mom tell me that you learned the deployers' moves.

4381
03:19:52,670 --> 03:19:52,710
I'm not good at your stuff.

4382
03:19:52,710 --> 03:19:53,610
Dad, you're just иногда 夢中の雪は...

4383
03:19:53,610 --> 03:19:55,110
It's okay.

4384
03:19:55,110 --> 03:19:55,950
I'm came to find out the delicious world of Earth from Earth.

4385
03:19:55,950 --> 03:19:56,350
My dreams are more valuable when asked.

4386
03:19:56,350 --> 03:19:56,930
Don't look.

4387
03:20:09,390 --> 03:20:10,710
This is him doing Otage.

4388
03:20:13,310 --> 03:20:14,270
He's like...

4389
03:20:18,830 --> 03:20:23,590
I thought we were playing Metal Gear, not karaoke.

4390
03:20:23,950 --> 03:20:25,550
That was literally a Metal Gear song!

4391
03:20:25,550 --> 03:20:27,390
Oh my gosh, freedom!

4392
03:20:27,710 --> 03:20:28,450
Can you smell?

4393
03:20:28,790 --> 03:20:30,890
Can you smell the air?

4394
03:20:31,090 --> 03:20:32,090
The fresh air?

4395
03:20:33,350 --> 03:20:34,590
Oh, my nose is...

4396
03:20:36,850 --> 03:20:37,490
Alright.

4397
03:20:40,170 --> 03:20:40,930
Let's go.

4398
03:20:45,110 --> 03:20:46,810
I hate the smell of bees.

4399
03:20:49,610 --> 03:20:52,090
Something about... some bug smell is so bad.

4400
03:21:09,990 --> 03:21:10,650
No!

4401
03:21:10,870 --> 03:21:11,210
No!

4402
03:21:16,490 --> 03:21:17,790
What about Matara?

4403
03:21:17,950 --> 03:21:18,850
That's why...

4404
03:21:18,850 --> 03:21:20,430
Bee... not bee...

4405
03:21:20,430 --> 03:21:20,870
Yeah!

4406
03:21:22,550 --> 03:21:23,210
Burger!

4407
03:21:24,810 --> 03:21:25,630
Oh yeah.

4408
03:21:25,750 --> 03:21:26,170
Oh yeah.

4409
03:21:26,310 --> 03:21:27,030
Oh yeah.

4410
03:21:27,990 --> 03:21:29,370
He's so tokusatsu.

4411
03:21:29,370 --> 03:21:31,350
The world of anguish beyond your imagination.

4412
03:21:31,970 --> 03:21:32,970
The pain.

4413
03:21:35,430 --> 03:21:37,730
For some reason, I always call this guy the Fury.

4414
03:21:40,690 --> 03:21:42,130
Like my brain...

4415
03:21:43,110 --> 03:21:44,350
Let's get started.

4416
03:21:44,350 --> 03:21:45,530
...knows who he is.

4417
03:21:46,990 --> 03:21:47,590
Okay.

4418
03:21:48,890 --> 03:21:50,650
What was the trick for this one again?

4419
03:21:50,830 --> 03:21:51,470
Let's see.

4420
03:21:54,110 --> 03:21:54,410
Oh!

4421
03:21:55,230 --> 03:21:55,830
No!

4422
03:21:57,210 --> 03:21:58,170
Oh my gosh!

4423
03:21:59,730 --> 03:22:00,650
I'm stinky!

4424
03:22:00,910 --> 03:22:01,750
I'm smelly!

4425
03:22:05,510 --> 03:22:06,330
One second.

4426
03:22:07,150 --> 03:22:08,670
I'm just gonna drown under here.

4427
03:22:09,290 --> 03:22:10,050
Let's see.

4428
03:22:10,230 --> 03:22:11,230
So if I change...

4429
03:22:14,470 --> 03:22:15,070
Water...

4430
03:22:15,070 --> 03:22:15,870
Wow!

4431
03:22:16,130 --> 03:22:16,570
Wow!

4432
03:22:20,610 --> 03:22:22,450
I like this...

4433
03:22:23,530 --> 03:22:24,590
So much!

4434
03:22:26,430 --> 03:22:27,030
Wait.

4435
03:22:27,070 --> 03:22:28,630
I can't... How do I... There we go.

4436
03:22:29,530 --> 03:22:30,090
Wait.

4437
03:22:30,150 --> 03:22:31,550
I like this one so much!

4438
03:22:33,870 --> 03:22:34,430
Wow!

4439
03:22:36,150 --> 03:22:36,710
Wow!

4440
03:22:40,590 --> 03:22:41,850
Actually looks so good!

4441
03:22:43,710 --> 03:22:44,270
Okay.

4442
03:22:46,070 --> 03:22:48,470
I don't think face... Yeah.

4443
03:22:50,890 --> 03:22:54,070
Do I have in my arsenal...

4444
03:22:54,630 --> 03:22:56,790
I have stun grenades, but I don't have grenade grenades.

4445
03:22:56,930 --> 03:22:58,170
So let's change that.

4446
03:22:59,770 --> 03:23:02,710
I'm gonna get rid of the stun grenade, so I don't accidentally click on it.

4447
03:23:03,410 --> 03:23:04,810
Because I would, baby!

4448
03:23:05,030 --> 03:23:05,530
I would!

4449
03:23:06,550 --> 03:23:06,990
And...

4450
03:23:10,740 --> 03:23:12,280
You want that shotty.

4451
03:23:12,300 --> 03:23:12,620
Oh!

4452
03:23:12,660 --> 03:23:13,360
The shotgun!

4453
03:23:13,460 --> 03:23:14,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4454
03:23:15,860 --> 03:23:16,740
The M37.

4455
03:23:22,320 --> 03:23:23,060
Oh, shoot!

4456
03:23:26,180 --> 03:23:27,060
So now...

4457
03:23:27,680 --> 03:23:29,440
I throw grenade at him.

4458
03:23:30,240 --> 03:23:30,680
Okay.

4459
03:23:30,700 --> 03:23:31,980
Press square to hold.

4460
03:23:32,060 --> 03:23:32,720
Release to throw.

4461
03:23:40,980 --> 03:23:41,800
Oh, fuck!

4462
03:23:41,940 --> 03:23:42,540
The Tommy gun!

4463
03:23:43,240 --> 03:23:43,640
Stop!

4464
03:23:44,240 --> 03:23:44,880
Go down!

4465
03:23:46,860 --> 03:23:47,260
No!

4466
03:23:52,220 --> 03:23:52,620
No!

4467
03:23:52,660 --> 03:23:53,020
No, no, no!

4468
03:23:53,160 --> 03:23:53,680
No, no!

4469
03:23:53,820 --> 03:23:54,400
No, no, no!

4470
03:23:57,720 --> 03:23:58,420
Tommy gun!

4471
03:24:01,260 --> 03:24:03,420
If I try and shoot him right now...

4472
03:24:04,480 --> 03:24:05,520
Oh, I can't shoot him.

4473
03:24:05,840 --> 03:24:06,660
In the water.

4474
03:24:07,020 --> 03:24:07,840
That's so unfortunate.

4475
03:24:25,570 --> 03:24:26,370
The fish.

4476
03:24:26,550 --> 03:24:27,750
I love when all the fish die.

4477
03:24:27,870 --> 03:24:28,430
It's so funny.

4478
03:24:28,930 --> 03:24:29,650
Okay, hold on.

4479
03:24:29,690 --> 03:24:31,010
I have to remember how to do this fight.

4480
03:24:33,150 --> 03:24:34,830
It's always the grenades, man.

4481
03:24:35,090 --> 03:24:35,810
They're always the grenades.

4482
03:24:36,070 --> 03:24:36,330
Look at me.

4483
03:24:37,650 --> 03:24:38,190
What's up?

4484
03:24:38,310 --> 03:24:39,770
We got a burn ointment.

4485
03:24:40,890 --> 03:24:42,110
What did we do?

4486
03:24:44,290 --> 03:24:45,090
The bandage.

4487
03:24:45,470 --> 03:24:46,190
Okay, we're good.

4488
03:24:48,110 --> 03:24:49,030
Take your time, Minto.

4489
03:24:49,150 --> 03:24:49,730
Thank you!

4490
03:24:51,890 --> 03:24:53,450
There he is!

4491
03:24:53,450 --> 03:24:58,230
Oh my gosh, that was so close.

4492
03:25:03,290 --> 03:25:04,690
This is so sad!

4493
03:25:04,970 --> 03:25:05,930
Oh my gosh, my...

4494
03:25:06,790 --> 03:25:07,570
Holy cow.

4495
03:25:11,050 --> 03:25:11,930
Air awareness!

4496
03:25:16,010 --> 03:25:17,910
And I know this one tasted bad.

4497
03:25:17,990 --> 03:25:18,290
We'll eat it.

4498
03:25:20,650 --> 03:25:21,210
Disgusting.

4499
03:25:21,370 --> 03:25:22,690
This is horrible.

4500
03:25:24,150 --> 03:25:25,170
See the crab?

4501
03:25:25,750 --> 03:25:26,690
Eating underwater?

4502
03:25:27,030 --> 03:25:27,290
Yeah.

4503
03:25:28,090 --> 03:25:29,170
You know how it is.

4504
03:25:38,910 --> 03:25:40,250
I think I can... No!

4505
03:25:40,530 --> 03:25:41,030
Why?

4506
03:25:41,130 --> 03:25:41,890
I'm not sticky!

4507
03:25:42,170 --> 03:25:42,550
Please!

4508
03:25:43,590 --> 03:25:43,610
Ha!

4509
03:26:08,240 --> 03:26:09,260
I don't know!

4510
03:26:09,340 --> 03:26:09,820
I don't know!

4511
03:26:21,670 --> 03:26:22,230
Okay.

4512
03:26:32,090 --> 03:26:32,890
Hold the button longer?

4513
03:26:33,190 --> 03:26:34,950
How long do I need to hold it?

4514
03:26:37,770 --> 03:26:38,910
First person him?

4515
03:26:41,010 --> 03:26:41,530
Oh.

4516
03:26:56,960 --> 03:26:58,380
Shooting him on the platform.

4517
03:26:59,220 --> 03:27:01,460
I don't remember how I did it before, but...

4518
03:27:01,460 --> 03:27:02,420
Oh my gosh, the...

4519
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:04,340
The... Oh my gosh.

4520
03:27:05,520 --> 03:27:11,060
Getting the camera to work as soon as I'm out of the water is so annoying.

4521
03:27:18,540 --> 03:27:19,160
What's this?

4522
03:27:19,680 --> 03:27:20,200
Grenades!

4523
03:27:21,340 --> 03:27:21,660
Grenades.

4524
03:27:33,360 --> 03:27:33,740
Okay.

4525
03:27:36,160 --> 03:27:36,920
Ah!

4526
03:27:40,120 --> 03:27:44,120
I think I'm gonna just die here because I'm already not feeling this ride.

4527
03:27:49,200 --> 03:27:50,320
So, okay.

4528
03:27:51,720 --> 03:27:52,480
No!

4529
03:27:55,100 --> 03:27:56,300
A bullet!

4530
03:28:11,120 --> 03:28:11,880
Hiya!

4531
03:28:11,880 --> 03:28:11,960
Hiya!

4532
03:28:13,680 --> 03:28:14,660
Uh, that should...

4533
03:28:14,660 --> 03:28:15,620
Uh...

4534
03:28:16,440 --> 03:28:17,240
Oh,

4535
03:28:22,060 --> 03:28:22,560
they got it!

4536
03:28:36,550 --> 03:28:36,950
Ewww!

4537
03:28:46,870 --> 03:28:49,350
Gonna need some more...

4538
03:28:50,570 --> 03:28:52,330
Some more burn away, please.

4539
03:28:54,190 --> 03:28:56,290
Maybe I should just stand up on them.

4540
03:28:56,750 --> 03:28:57,510
Okay, like, okay.

4541
03:29:07,200 --> 03:29:07,600
Oh!

4542
03:29:09,560 --> 03:29:09,960
Oh!

4543
03:29:10,100 --> 03:29:11,120
Wait, which one are you?

4544
03:29:13,060 --> 03:29:13,460
Uh...

4545
03:29:16,560 --> 03:29:16,960
You?

4546
03:29:17,180 --> 03:29:17,580
Ah!

4547
03:29:17,820 --> 03:29:18,980
I shot the right one!

4548
03:29:24,040 --> 03:29:24,440
Wait!

4549
03:29:24,500 --> 03:29:25,240
I shot the right one!

4550
03:29:29,440 --> 03:29:30,240
My brothers.

4551
03:29:30,340 --> 03:29:31,040
Is he a bee?

4552
03:29:31,300 --> 03:29:32,040
I think so.

4553
03:29:36,100 --> 03:29:36,540
What?

4554
03:29:36,620 --> 03:29:37,380
How did you find me?

4555
03:29:39,880 --> 03:29:41,120
How did you find me though?

4556
03:29:43,660 --> 03:29:44,500
What was it?

4557
03:29:45,260 --> 03:29:46,000
Gosh, okay.

4558
03:29:46,080 --> 03:29:47,160
I'm gonna have to figure out what to do.

4559
03:29:47,540 --> 03:29:47,980
Grenade!

4560
03:29:48,160 --> 03:29:48,600
Grenade!

4561
03:29:49,900 --> 03:29:51,560
Did you just kick it back at me?

4562
03:29:56,670 --> 03:29:57,110
Idiot!

4563
03:29:57,110 --> 03:29:57,510
Wait.

4564
03:29:58,230 --> 03:29:58,670
Um...

4565
03:29:58,670 --> 03:29:59,150
Return!

4566
03:29:59,590 --> 03:29:59,850
Return!

4567
03:30:03,450 --> 03:30:03,890
Um...

4568
03:30:03,890 --> 03:30:04,410
Grenade!

4569
03:30:04,530 --> 03:30:04,850
Grenade!

4570
03:30:06,430 --> 03:30:06,870
Grenade!

4571
03:30:06,870 --> 03:30:07,190
Grenade!

4572
03:30:11,020 --> 03:30:12,740
The one time I shoot it too far.

4573
03:30:13,340 --> 03:30:13,720
No!

4574
03:30:19,070 --> 03:30:20,090
Let's go get some food.

4575
03:30:22,350 --> 03:30:23,590
Oh yeah, I'll take some fish.

4576
03:30:26,350 --> 03:30:27,090
Eat this!

4577
03:30:30,740 --> 03:30:31,620
Oh, get up.

4578
03:30:32,220 --> 03:30:33,860
Oh, this, this again?

4579
03:30:34,060 --> 03:30:35,100
Your little magic trick?

4580
03:30:35,660 --> 03:30:36,920
Your little magic trick?

4581
03:30:44,320 --> 03:30:45,280
My Hornet!

4582
03:30:47,080 --> 03:30:47,560
Doing

4583
03:30:51,040 --> 03:30:52,360
his little song and dance again?

4584
03:30:52,480 --> 03:30:53,900
Oh my gosh, I cannot see any of this.

4585
03:30:55,880 --> 03:30:56,480
This is so annoying.

4586
03:30:56,700 --> 03:30:57,620
What's that?

4587
03:30:57,800 --> 03:30:59,400
I'm throwing a grenade at you.

4588
03:31:01,540 --> 03:31:02,140
Grenade!

4589
03:31:02,540 --> 03:31:02,760
Oh!

4590
03:31:03,080 --> 03:31:05,200
Uh, don't do that.

4591
03:31:05,340 --> 03:31:06,100
Don't do that.

4592
03:31:06,500 --> 03:31:07,040
Ah!

4593
03:31:17,910 --> 03:31:18,830
Dimey God.

4594
03:31:23,940 --> 03:31:24,820
Dimey God.

4595
03:31:32,230 --> 03:31:32,830
Hey!

4596
03:31:33,610 --> 03:31:34,730
Oh, hello, sick.

4597
03:31:36,730 --> 03:31:38,370
Oh, where am I actually?

4598
03:31:38,550 --> 03:31:38,850
Am I in the middle of nowhere?

4599
03:31:43,290 --> 03:31:43,810
I

4600
03:31:55,930 --> 03:32:00,510
think I shot and then I shoot again.

4601
03:32:00,750 --> 03:32:01,030
I think.

4602
03:32:06,300 --> 03:32:08,240
I think I shoot and then shoot again.

4603
03:32:09,880 --> 03:32:13,380
Why is the camera angle so bad though?

4604
03:32:15,920 --> 03:32:19,220
Oh, that was so close.

4605
03:32:21,560 --> 03:32:22,340
8k spray?

4606
03:32:22,780 --> 03:32:23,560
Let's try it.

4607
03:32:23,680 --> 03:32:25,220
Wait, do I have the 8k on mine?

4608
03:32:27,380 --> 03:32:30,080
I don't have to add it to my backpack.

4609
03:32:31,420 --> 03:32:32,360
Let's try it.

4610
03:32:32,360 --> 03:32:32,940
I can't remember.

4611
03:32:34,920 --> 03:32:36,880
Let's just... I'm gonna quit these for now.

4612
03:32:40,260 --> 03:32:41,660
Hi from Octoberfest!

4613
03:32:41,760 --> 03:32:42,300
Oh my gosh!

4614
03:32:47,740 --> 03:32:49,780
No... I'm... I think it's...

4615
03:32:51,920 --> 03:32:53,360
What was it?

4616
03:32:55,680 --> 03:32:56,620
OG camera?

4617
03:32:57,300 --> 03:32:58,780
I can't see anything!

4618
03:33:01,340 --> 03:33:02,160
Oh gosh.

4619
03:33:02,460 --> 03:33:03,380
I can't see.

4620
03:33:03,420 --> 03:33:04,440
I can't even see him.

4621
03:33:05,840 --> 03:33:06,360
Stop!

4622
03:33:06,520 --> 03:33:07,160
Don't say that!

4623
03:33:07,420 --> 03:33:08,100
I'm trying to film!

4624
03:33:23,880 --> 03:33:25,420
I'm gonna eat under water again.

4625
03:33:26,280 --> 03:33:27,980
You're embarrassing yourself!

4626
03:33:28,480 --> 03:33:29,060
Oh, I forgot he said that.

4627
03:33:29,200 --> 03:33:29,900
What a jerk!

4628
03:33:32,540 --> 03:33:33,400
Crap time!

4629
03:33:33,880 --> 03:33:36,040
Hey, this works.

4630
03:33:36,360 --> 03:33:38,560
Could this dude be any more known?

4631
03:33:40,040 --> 03:33:41,180
Nades and shotgun.

4632
03:33:42,140 --> 03:33:44,660
I wonder if the original camera is good here.

4633
03:33:44,940 --> 03:33:45,360
Actually...

4634
03:33:51,630 --> 03:33:53,130
That was close.

4635
03:33:55,470 --> 03:33:56,430
Oh my god!

4636
03:33:57,810 --> 03:33:58,590
Hold on!

4637
03:33:58,590 --> 03:33:59,050
Oh my god!

4638
03:34:00,230 --> 03:34:04,920
I love when I just walk up and he's like...

4639
03:34:06,580 --> 03:34:07,260
I'm waiting!

4640
03:34:18,820 --> 03:34:19,960
No, Tommy gun!

4641
03:34:23,860 --> 03:34:25,740
They're gonna be dropping bombs on me.

4642
03:34:26,900 --> 03:34:29,220
I keep forgetting to do this insert button here.

4643
03:34:30,100 --> 03:34:30,900
What do you mean?

4644
03:34:32,260 --> 03:34:33,460
I think he can get me here.

4645
03:34:37,700 --> 03:34:38,140
Okay.

4646
03:34:39,680 --> 03:34:40,260
There he is!

4647
03:34:40,360 --> 03:34:41,300
My brother!

4648
03:34:41,540 --> 03:34:42,060
Wait!

4649
03:34:42,300 --> 03:34:42,520
No!

4650
03:34:46,640 --> 03:34:48,180
There he is!

4651
03:34:48,280 --> 03:34:48,880
My brother!

4652
03:34:52,960 --> 03:34:54,000
I'm slippery.

4653
03:34:54,820 --> 03:34:56,220
It's a little slippery here.

4654
03:34:56,420 --> 03:34:56,880
Sorry.

4655
03:34:58,900 --> 03:34:59,420
No!

4656
03:35:02,540 --> 03:35:04,180
I don't want to just keep shooting.

4657
03:35:04,320 --> 03:35:05,040
It doesn't do anything.

4658
03:35:06,520 --> 03:35:09,140
I think I just have to wait until he's like...

4659
03:35:09,140 --> 03:35:10,180
Is that all you've got?

4660
03:35:10,360 --> 03:35:10,960
Until he's...

4661
03:35:13,100 --> 03:35:14,060
Take this!

4662
03:35:14,320 --> 03:35:14,440
No!

4663
03:35:22,220 --> 03:35:22,960
I'm trying!

4664
03:35:24,320 --> 03:35:25,640
I'm actually lost.

4665
03:35:25,760 --> 03:35:26,240
Hold on.

4666
03:35:26,420 --> 03:35:27,280
I'm too close to you.

4667
03:35:28,300 --> 03:35:28,920
Hold on.

4668
03:35:32,700 --> 03:35:33,180
Smoke?

4669
03:35:34,160 --> 03:35:34,640
No!

4670
03:35:38,840 --> 03:35:40,880
No, the shotgun doesn't knock the bees off.

4671
03:35:40,920 --> 03:35:41,820
I think they absorb it.

4672
03:35:41,900 --> 03:35:42,600
I think when he...

4673
03:35:42,600 --> 03:35:45,540
When I was doing it...

4674
03:35:45,540 --> 03:35:47,780
It was just absorbing it.

4675
03:35:47,780 --> 03:35:49,320
I don't think I was missing.

4676
03:35:49,520 --> 03:35:50,400
It looked like it was hitting.

4677
03:35:55,600 --> 03:35:56,020
Grenades?

4678
03:35:56,060 --> 03:35:58,080
But the bees catch the grenades.

4679
03:35:58,240 --> 03:35:59,140
So how do I...

4680
03:36:00,260 --> 03:36:00,940
Stop them?

4681
03:36:02,060 --> 03:36:02,480
Sorry.

4682
03:36:02,860 --> 03:36:04,540
This one kills me every time.

4683
03:36:04,580 --> 03:36:05,380
It's so funny.

4684
03:36:07,400 --> 03:36:08,260
You're like this.

4685
03:36:10,100 --> 03:36:11,540
Three shotgun shots to remove.

4686
03:36:11,760 --> 03:36:11,940
Ahhh!

4687
03:36:12,960 --> 03:36:14,180
You gotta hit him multiple times.

4688
03:36:14,180 --> 03:36:14,460
Ahhh!

4689
03:36:16,020 --> 03:36:17,080
I see.

4690
03:36:17,760 --> 03:36:18,940
That's why.

4691
03:36:19,540 --> 03:36:20,520
I think it's this one.

4692
03:36:22,080 --> 03:36:22,920
Oh!

4693
03:36:26,600 --> 03:36:27,540
Wait, what?

4694
03:36:29,720 --> 03:36:30,560
Huh?

4695
03:36:54,490 --> 03:36:58,070
Phase two time.

4696
03:37:06,750 --> 03:37:07,190
No!

4697
03:37:07,650 --> 03:37:08,150
Oh my god.

4698
03:37:09,770 --> 03:37:10,910
I'm scared of these guys.

4699
03:37:11,410 --> 03:37:11,850
Grenade!

4700
03:37:12,030 --> 03:37:12,670
Not grenade.

4701
03:37:21,980 --> 03:37:22,740
Where am I?

4702
03:37:22,900 --> 03:37:24,820
Oh, I'm actually...

4703
03:37:25,800 --> 03:37:26,980
Where am I for real?

4704
03:37:27,160 --> 03:37:28,100
Oh, he's doing this again.

4705
03:37:28,800 --> 03:37:29,380
Hold on.

4706
03:37:31,540 --> 03:37:34,120
Hold on, I'm trying to figure out where I can go.

4707
03:37:34,340 --> 03:37:34,820
I'm lost.

4708
03:37:37,980 --> 03:37:38,420
Ahhh!

4709
03:37:39,140 --> 03:37:39,800
Not the...

4710
03:37:42,550 --> 03:37:43,670
I was lost!

4711
03:37:43,790 --> 03:37:44,470
I was lost!

4712
03:37:45,690 --> 03:37:45,770
Hahaha.

4713
03:37:47,350 --> 03:37:48,970
Okay, there's our little platform.

4714
03:37:49,190 --> 03:37:50,550
I feel comfortable with this one.

4715
03:37:51,030 --> 03:37:51,290
Hahaha.

4716
03:37:59,460 --> 03:38:00,000
Phew.

4717
03:38:03,020 --> 03:38:04,240
There you are.

4718
03:38:07,640 --> 03:38:08,180
Okay.

4719
03:38:13,900 --> 03:38:15,560
I don't know if that hit him, actually.

4720
03:38:17,040 --> 03:38:17,580
Was

4721
03:38:24,520 --> 03:38:24,840
that...

4722
03:38:24,840 --> 03:38:26,560
Oh, he sent a scent.

4723
03:38:27,660 --> 03:38:28,200
Bombs!

4724
03:38:28,320 --> 03:38:28,980
Uh oh.

4725
03:38:30,380 --> 03:38:30,920
Woo!

4726
03:38:31,900 --> 03:38:32,440
Grenade!

4727
03:38:32,760 --> 03:38:33,120
Hahaha.

4728
03:38:34,800 --> 03:38:36,180
I got him though, didn't I?

4729
03:38:36,200 --> 03:38:36,700
Just a little bit.

4730
03:38:41,470 --> 03:38:42,730
Where could I be?

4731
03:38:43,670 --> 03:38:45,210
Where could I be?

4732
03:38:45,550 --> 03:38:45,830
Ah!

4733
03:38:47,670 --> 03:38:49,190
There he is!

4734
03:38:49,330 --> 03:38:50,150
My brother!

4735
03:38:55,040 --> 03:38:55,800
I'm hungry.

4736
03:38:56,200 --> 03:38:56,400
Hahaha.

4737
03:39:00,870 --> 03:39:03,750
Eat a little bit of a reticulated python.

4738
03:39:04,530 --> 03:39:05,970
Boss, I'm so happy to see you back!

4739
03:39:06,130 --> 03:39:06,730
Thank you!

4740
03:39:08,270 --> 03:39:09,530
Thank you for the super time!

4741
03:39:10,610 --> 03:39:11,090
Hahaha.

4742
03:39:12,450 --> 03:39:13,070
Thank you, thank you!

4743
03:39:14,450 --> 03:39:15,710
Oh, oh, oh.

4744
03:39:15,950 --> 03:39:17,250
Come out and play!

4745
03:39:17,550 --> 03:39:18,370
I'm right here!

4746
03:39:19,530 --> 03:39:20,090
Get him!

4747
03:39:25,880 --> 03:39:28,080
Where do I aim with this thing?

4748
03:39:28,620 --> 03:39:30,340
I got him, but I didn't.

4749
03:39:30,340 --> 03:39:30,740
I'm confused.

4750
03:39:34,470 --> 03:39:40,570
I think I'm gonna try and only go back and forth between this one and...

4751
03:39:40,570 --> 03:39:41,910
Okay, he's that one.

4752
03:39:42,930 --> 03:39:43,490
Oh yeah.

4753
03:39:53,220 --> 03:39:54,080
Where is it?

4754
03:39:54,160 --> 03:39:54,860
Oh, there it is!

4755
03:39:56,100 --> 03:39:56,620
Slowly...

4756
03:39:57,520 --> 03:39:58,800
coming towards me.

4757
03:39:59,480 --> 03:40:00,000
Ah!

4758
03:40:03,260 --> 03:40:04,260
Wait, I'm lost.

4759
03:40:04,480 --> 03:40:08,840
So I'll go back and forth between these two platforms.

4760
03:40:09,560 --> 03:40:10,080
Bernard!

4761
03:40:16,000 --> 03:40:17,040
Center mass...

4762
03:40:17,660 --> 03:40:19,060
It's so hard, right?

4763
03:40:19,340 --> 03:40:20,260
Look at this, at least.

4764
03:40:22,600 --> 03:40:24,080
There he is!

4765
03:40:24,080 --> 03:40:25,020
My brother!

4766
03:40:30,460 --> 03:40:30,940
Pshew!

4767
03:40:32,080 --> 03:40:33,640
They're makin' this fi...

4768
03:40:35,360 --> 03:40:36,100
Oh, uh...

4769
03:40:36,100 --> 03:40:37,020
Oh, shoot.

4770
03:40:37,200 --> 03:40:37,460
Ah!

4771
03:40:39,140 --> 03:40:40,540
Oh wait, I'm...

4772
03:40:40,540 --> 03:40:43,160
Okay, I have to stick this one out, I think.

4773
03:40:45,580 --> 03:40:46,060
Ah!

4774
03:40:51,360 --> 03:40:52,360
Gonna go back to...

4775
03:40:52,360 --> 03:40:52,740
Wait.

4776
03:40:53,840 --> 03:40:54,620
The other side?

4777
03:40:54,740 --> 03:40:55,000
This way.

4778
03:40:57,060 --> 03:40:57,540
Okay.

4779
03:40:58,380 --> 03:40:59,720
At least they drop.

4780
03:41:01,360 --> 03:41:02,600
Lots of bullets still.

4781
03:41:03,320 --> 03:41:03,800
For this fight.

4782
03:41:11,120 --> 03:41:11,480
Bernard.

4783
03:41:35,850 --> 03:41:37,170
Alright, let's go back to the other side.

4784
03:41:38,350 --> 03:41:40,030
Slowly but sure, we're chippin' it away!

4785
03:41:40,150 --> 03:41:40,950
We're chippin' it away!

4786
03:41:43,290 --> 03:41:44,010
You guys...

4787
03:41:45,950 --> 03:41:46,310
I'm...

4788
03:41:46,810 --> 03:41:47,950
I'm speedrunning.

4789
03:41:49,870 --> 03:41:50,550
You see me?

4790
03:41:50,550 --> 03:41:50,750
How?

4791
03:41:51,790 --> 03:41:52,830
I was under the water.

4792
03:41:59,780 --> 03:42:00,560
What the hell was that?

4793
03:42:00,640 --> 03:42:00,740
Oh.

4794
03:42:01,320 --> 03:42:01,980
Oh my god.

4795
03:42:03,860 --> 03:42:04,700
Tommy gun!

4796
03:42:09,020 --> 03:42:10,220
Slowly but surely...

4797
03:42:12,640 --> 03:42:13,120
Slowly but surely...

4798
03:42:13,120 --> 03:42:14,060
Chippin' it away!

4799
03:42:14,980 --> 03:42:15,260
Chippin' it away!

4800
03:42:15,260 --> 03:42:15,460
Oh.

4801
03:42:17,500 --> 03:42:20,160
Sorry, it's so funny that he's, like, shooting over there.

4802
03:42:22,700 --> 03:42:23,360
What the?

4803
03:42:31,720 --> 03:42:32,400
I didn't...

4804
03:42:33,060 --> 03:42:34,880
I didn't know he could do that!

4805
03:42:38,680 --> 03:42:40,820
I didn't know he could do that!

4806
03:42:42,060 --> 03:42:43,700
Wait, where's the...

4807
03:42:43,700 --> 03:42:45,840
Oh my gosh!

4808
03:42:46,000 --> 03:42:47,300
The jump's scaring me for real!

4809
03:42:47,960 --> 03:42:49,440
Game is laggin' a little bit.

4810
03:43:01,760 --> 03:43:02,360
Hey!

4811
03:43:03,440 --> 03:43:03,940
Hey!

4812
03:43:04,640 --> 03:43:05,240
Stop!

4813
03:43:05,900 --> 03:43:06,620
Thank ya!

4814
03:43:07,440 --> 03:43:08,040
Oh.

4815
03:43:11,580 --> 03:43:12,180
Oh.

4816
03:43:17,710 --> 03:43:18,710
Get him!

4817
03:43:19,130 --> 03:43:19,730
Hmm...

4818
03:43:19,730 --> 03:43:22,630
A bullet.

4819
03:43:22,890 --> 03:43:24,730
I thought I was dropping stuff for this one.

4820
03:43:24,730 --> 03:43:25,450
I...

4821
03:43:25,450 --> 03:43:27,550
was, uh, mistaken.

4822
03:43:27,910 --> 03:43:29,350
Guess it's time to use our AK.

4823
03:43:31,770 --> 03:43:32,370
Grenade!

4824
03:43:58,110 --> 03:44:00,350
That recoil is disgusting.

4825
03:44:02,510 --> 03:44:03,690
It's, uh...

4826
03:44:04,470 --> 03:44:05,630
You know...

4827
03:44:09,880 --> 03:44:11,160
I don't think it's...

4828
03:44:11,160 --> 03:44:14,620
I can't tell when they're gonna...

4829
03:44:14,620 --> 03:44:17,020
I can't tell if they're gonna, you know...

4830
03:44:17,020 --> 03:44:19,920
I have, like, just one more shot on this guy!

4831
03:44:20,980 --> 03:44:21,340
No!

4832
03:44:21,340 --> 03:44:21,920
Tommy gun!

4833
03:44:30,120 --> 03:44:31,500
Can't shoot the armor off with AK.

4834
03:44:31,720 --> 03:44:31,880
Oh!

4835
03:44:32,380 --> 03:44:33,940
Okay, I thought it would be, like, the shotgun.

4836
03:44:34,560 --> 03:44:35,880
So I have to grenade him.

4837
03:44:36,460 --> 03:44:37,820
But I can only grenade...

4838
03:44:37,820 --> 03:44:40,500
Oh my gosh, this is so frustrating cause I'm at, like, the last bit!

4839
03:44:43,180 --> 03:44:43,900
Grenade finisher.

4840
03:44:44,780 --> 03:44:46,260
Actually... Wait, can I do it here?

4841
03:44:50,540 --> 03:44:50,900
No!

4842
03:44:50,900 --> 03:44:51,440
I was wrong!

4843
03:44:56,080 --> 03:44:57,040
I was wrong!

4844
03:44:57,420 --> 03:44:58,000
What's this one?

4845
03:44:58,820 --> 03:44:58,840
Kill it!

4846
03:44:59,200 --> 03:45:00,180
Oh, it's a grenade.

4847
03:45:02,420 --> 03:45:04,000
Just a tiny bit more!

4848
03:45:04,560 --> 03:45:06,440
Just a little bit more!

4849
03:45:08,280 --> 03:45:10,560
I'm afraid the bees are gonna grab my grenades though.

4850
03:45:12,580 --> 03:45:15,520
There he is!

4851
03:45:15,720 --> 03:45:16,600
My brother!

4852
03:45:16,940 --> 03:45:18,580
I am once again hungry.

4853
03:45:23,780 --> 03:45:27,180
This guy is a pain in my butt!

4854
03:45:30,500 --> 03:45:31,600
Dammit, this works.

4855
03:45:31,940 --> 03:45:33,240
Did I get shotgun?

4856
03:45:35,160 --> 03:45:36,380
I don't think so.

4857
03:45:37,200 --> 03:45:37,800
No.

4858
03:45:44,740 --> 03:45:46,260
I didn't even...

4859
03:45:46,260 --> 03:45:48,740
I didn't even...

4860
03:45:51,220 --> 03:45:51,820
Please...

4861
03:45:51,820 --> 03:45:52,960
Aw, see?

4862
03:45:53,420 --> 03:45:54,800
They just grab it!

4863
03:45:56,240 --> 03:45:56,840
I

4864
03:46:08,100 --> 03:46:10,120
think I have to do it while he doesn't notice me.

4865
03:46:10,320 --> 03:46:12,600
But, so...

4866
03:46:12,600 --> 03:46:13,680
Oh...

4867
03:46:16,320 --> 03:46:19,000
Triangle while select equals single shot.

4868
03:46:22,100 --> 03:46:22,660
Wait...

4869
03:46:22,660 --> 03:46:24,800
Can I see a secret spot?

4870
03:46:25,940 --> 03:46:26,500
Nope.

4871
03:46:26,640 --> 03:46:27,160
Just kidding.

4872
03:46:27,200 --> 03:46:28,380
My eye is deceiving me.

4873
03:46:31,320 --> 03:46:32,500
When he grabs it...

4874
03:46:32,500 --> 03:46:33,120
Wait, what's...

4875
03:46:33,120 --> 03:46:33,560
Wait, maybe?

4876
03:46:33,760 --> 03:46:34,500
Maybe, maybe, maybe?

4877
03:46:35,860 --> 03:46:36,420
Please?

4878
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:37,460
Yeah!

4879
03:46:38,240 --> 03:46:38,800
Okay.

4880
03:46:39,000 --> 03:46:39,580
Alright, guys.

4881
03:46:39,620 --> 03:46:40,200
We're good to go.

4882
03:46:40,200 --> 03:46:41,020
I knew it...

4883
03:46:41,600 --> 03:46:43,500
I knew it was giving me more!

4884
03:46:44,060 --> 03:46:46,640
I just... didn't know...

4885
03:46:46,640 --> 03:46:47,100
Okay.

4886
03:46:47,260 --> 03:46:47,740
Yay!

4887
03:46:48,520 --> 03:46:49,660
We're so back, baby.

4888
03:46:50,260 --> 03:46:51,400
I love the shotgun.

4889
03:46:53,380 --> 03:46:54,780
We're so back!

4890
03:46:57,060 --> 03:46:58,360
Alright, let's go over here.

4891
03:47:05,410 --> 03:47:05,970
Come on.

4892
03:47:06,010 --> 03:47:06,330
Come on, Snake.

4893
03:47:07,590 --> 03:47:08,630
It's the one on the right.

4894
03:47:08,770 --> 03:47:09,430
It's gotta be.

4895
03:47:14,670 --> 03:47:15,150
Hello?

4896
03:47:15,250 --> 03:47:15,610
Please.

4897
03:47:21,580 --> 03:47:22,020
Yay!

4898
03:47:22,220 --> 03:47:24,220
Thanks for giving me more shotgun ammo, game!

4899
03:47:31,580 --> 03:47:32,400
The pain.

4900
03:47:32,620 --> 03:47:33,060
The pain.

4901
03:47:33,540 --> 03:47:39,560
So, if I were to throw the grenade and then shoot it when the bees are all over it, it would explode and then get him?

4902
03:47:39,740 --> 03:47:40,600
Is that how it would?

4903
03:47:41,480 --> 03:47:42,100
The pain!

4904
03:47:45,060 --> 03:47:45,940
It explodes!

4905
03:48:02,070 --> 03:48:04,050
These guys ended World War 2?

4906
03:48:04,170 --> 03:48:05,290
Could've fooled me!

4907
03:48:06,230 --> 03:48:06,810
What?

4908
03:48:07,660 --> 03:48:09,390
I think he's a great...

4909
03:48:09,390 --> 03:48:10,490
warrior.

4910
03:48:13,490 --> 03:48:15,830
I wish it would give me more...

4911
03:48:16,890 --> 03:48:17,470
um...

4912
03:48:17,470 --> 03:48:18,530
ammo.

4913
03:48:20,110 --> 03:48:23,690
I don't think there's anything else around here that I hadn't already gotten.

4914
03:48:28,510 --> 03:48:31,590
Really just wanna take my shotgun now and blast through everything.

4915
03:48:33,150 --> 03:48:34,370
Why did he explode?

4916
03:48:36,470 --> 03:48:37,910
Why did the high explode?

4917
03:48:42,100 --> 03:48:43,140
I was gonna call.

4918
03:48:43,260 --> 03:48:45,380
The exit from the cave should be toward the back.

4919
03:48:45,580 --> 03:48:47,720
Proceed through the cave and find the exit...

4920
03:48:47,720 --> 03:48:50,260
Major, you're not gonna comment about my great victory just then?

4921
03:48:50,360 --> 03:48:53,720
I literally just offed one of the members of a Cobra unit.

4922
03:48:53,860 --> 03:48:54,100
Please!

4923
03:48:54,380 --> 03:48:55,320
Give me the credit!

4924
03:48:55,580 --> 03:48:57,300
I see you've caught yourself a maroon shark.

4925
03:48:57,440 --> 03:48:58,240
A maroon shark?

4926
03:48:58,380 --> 03:49:01,260
The maroon shark is found mostly in Southeast Asia.

4927
03:49:01,260 --> 03:49:03,080
But it's not actually a shark.

4928
03:49:03,340 --> 03:49:04,560
It's related to the carp.

4929
03:49:05,440 --> 03:49:10,840
It's also known as the redfin cigar shark, the river barb, and the salton fish.

4930
03:49:11,120 --> 03:49:12,340
Why does it have so many names?

4931
03:49:13,400 --> 03:49:14,720
How does it taste?

4932
03:49:15,180 --> 03:49:17,700
According to the guide, it's good.

4933
03:49:17,920 --> 03:49:21,100
But it's kind of oily and has a lot of little bones.

4934
03:49:21,500 --> 03:49:22,460
Fine with me.

4935
03:49:22,820 --> 03:49:24,800
I never worry about the little things.

4936
03:49:25,240 --> 03:49:26,380
So I gathered.

4937
03:49:28,100 --> 03:49:29,840
Snake does not worry about the little things.

4938
03:49:30,640 --> 03:49:32,520
Wearing the water pattern, are we?

4939
03:49:32,760 --> 03:49:36,840
The water pattern was used a lot by the old German defense force.

4940
03:49:37,320 --> 03:49:41,600
Even though it's called the water pattern, it wasn't designed specifically to blend in underwater.

4941
03:49:41,980 --> 03:49:42,460
Then what?

4942
03:49:42,660 --> 03:49:46,920
They only gave it that name because the pattern resembles the waves on the surface of a pool of water.

4943
03:49:47,160 --> 03:49:51,180
But still it really does look like it could be confused for liquid waves.

4944
03:49:51,520 --> 03:49:53,120
It might conceal you underwater.

4945
03:49:54,780 --> 03:49:55,740
I don't...

4946
03:49:55,740 --> 03:49:56,620
I don't...

4947
03:49:57,140 --> 03:49:59,960
I don't understand the purpose of this.

4948
03:50:03,420 --> 03:50:04,760
Alright, let's get going.

4949
03:50:05,240 --> 03:50:05,760
Alright, let's get going.

4950
03:50:05,760 --> 03:50:08,920
Unless I really don't think there's anything else underneath here.

4951
03:50:09,100 --> 03:50:10,400
I think they took away all the items.

4952
03:50:10,540 --> 03:50:11,220
So let's just go.

4953
03:50:19,880 --> 03:50:25,580
I feel like usually in games I'll like want to use I'll want to go for the non-lethal method.

4954
03:50:26,120 --> 03:50:27,580
But in these they explode.

4955
03:50:28,500 --> 03:50:31,140
So going non-lethal just doesn't feel right.

4956
03:50:32,380 --> 03:50:32,900
So going non-lethal just doesn't feel right.

4957
03:50:34,000 --> 03:50:34,440
So going non-lethal just doesn't feel right.

4958
03:50:34,440 --> 03:50:36,260
And these they just blow up.

4959
03:50:36,640 --> 03:50:38,380
Oh in urban areas.

4960
03:50:38,540 --> 03:50:39,240
I guess so.

4961
03:50:43,960 --> 03:50:46,320
Blue is the most effective color for nighttime operations.

4962
03:50:46,460 --> 03:50:46,500
Blue is the most effective color for nighttime operations.

4963
03:50:46,500 --> 03:50:47,900
Okay that makes sense.

4964
03:50:51,480 --> 03:50:53,300
The reward camo for the pain sucks.

4965
03:50:53,500 --> 03:50:54,420
Oh what do you get actually?

4966
03:50:57,060 --> 03:50:57,500
Oh.

4967
03:50:59,120 --> 03:51:00,560
Congrats on defeating the pain!

4968
03:51:00,760 --> 03:51:04,860
Add to slow chip for 2 plus hours the first time I tried for hard and trank.

4969
03:51:05,560 --> 03:51:06,680
Add to slow chip for 2 plus hours the first time I tried for hard and trank.

4970
03:51:06,680 --> 03:51:07,340
Whatever it takes to win.

4971
03:51:07,560 --> 03:51:09,400
2 plus hours!

4972
03:51:21,260 --> 03:51:22,800
Oh it's smoggy.

4973
03:51:23,140 --> 03:51:25,020
It's dusty crusty here.

4974
03:51:25,600 --> 03:51:26,320
Oh no.

4975
03:51:26,810 --> 03:51:27,200
Drones.

4976
03:51:28,920 --> 03:51:29,700
People.

4977
03:51:30,340 --> 03:51:31,600
People on drones.

4978
03:51:32,120 --> 03:51:33,180
Flying people.

4979
03:51:33,420 --> 03:51:39,100
People in crafts that should not be available at this time.

4980
03:51:41,660 --> 03:51:42,860
The Pokemon glow!

4981
03:51:51,460 --> 03:51:52,340
R fruit.

4982
03:51:54,140 --> 03:51:54,760
Dang it.

4983
03:51:56,860 --> 03:51:57,580
More demon.

4984
03:51:57,900 --> 03:51:57,980
More demon.

4985
03:52:00,120 --> 03:52:01,060
What's the R fruit?

4986
03:52:02,020 --> 03:52:02,280
What's the R fruit?

4987
03:52:03,680 --> 03:52:06,100
You can shoot the bees you gather with this camo.

4988
03:52:06,140 --> 03:52:06,160
You can shoot the bees you gather with this camo.

4989
03:52:06,160 --> 03:52:06,600
Wait what?

4990
03:52:06,880 --> 03:52:07,360
Really?

4991
03:52:08,940 --> 03:52:11,160
I see you found a Russian false mango.

4992
03:52:11,360 --> 03:52:13,520
I see you found a Russian false mango.

4993
03:52:13,520 --> 03:52:16,740
This mango is a mango like fruit found only in Selenoyarsk.

4994
03:52:17,240 --> 03:52:17,720
Selenoyarsk.

4995
03:52:17,720 --> 03:52:20,120
The egg shaped fruit is sweet and tangy with a pleasing aroma.

4996
03:52:20,360 --> 03:52:21,280
Just like a mango.

4997
03:52:21,440 --> 03:52:22,180
But it's not.

4998
03:52:22,220 --> 03:52:23,220
It's a fake mango.

4999
03:52:23,380 --> 03:52:25,300
Also the seeds can be used to make a medicine that aids in digestion.

5000
03:52:25,620 --> 03:52:25,880
What?

5001
03:52:26,060 --> 03:52:28,820
It might come in handy if you ever have an upset stomach.

5002
03:52:28,820 --> 03:52:30,120
If you ever have a tummy ache snake.

5003
03:52:30,860 --> 03:52:31,680
Tummy hort.

5004
03:52:32,500 --> 03:52:33,780
It's a fake mango.

5005
03:52:33,960 --> 03:52:34,680
False mango.

5006
03:52:37,400 --> 03:52:38,320
Food for...

5007
03:52:38,840 --> 03:52:39,500
Let's eat.

5008
03:52:41,760 --> 03:52:42,420
Let's eat!

5009
03:52:45,870 --> 03:52:47,010
Not eaten yet.

5010
03:52:47,030 --> 03:52:48,310
Said to be edible in a pinch.

5011
03:52:49,530 --> 03:52:50,970
I don't know if we...

5012
03:52:50,970 --> 03:52:52,350
want that though, right?

5013
03:52:54,310 --> 03:52:56,530
Let's throw the vampire bat away.

5014
03:52:56,970 --> 03:52:58,890
Actually, let's eat the vampire bat.

5015
03:53:00,250 --> 03:53:01,510
I'm gonna puke.

5016
03:53:05,220 --> 03:53:06,480
I'm gonna puke.

5017
03:53:08,660 --> 03:53:09,260
Nice.

5018
03:53:12,020 --> 03:53:14,360
Look at these tiny little frog...

5019
03:53:14,360 --> 03:53:15,960
Okay, that's a poison frog.

5020
03:53:20,790 --> 03:53:21,990
That's a poison frog.

5021
03:53:24,270 --> 03:53:24,710
That's a poison frog.

5022
03:53:24,710 --> 03:53:26,410
I see you've captured a poison dart frog.

5023
03:53:26,570 --> 03:53:26,690
I see you've captured a poison dart frog.

5024
03:53:27,490 --> 03:53:31,850
The poison dart frog is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.

5025
03:53:32,350 --> 03:53:32,790
I'm gonna eat it.

5026
03:53:32,790 --> 03:53:33,870
And then cure myself of my tummy ache.

5027
03:53:33,870 --> 03:53:35,070
And then cure myself of my tummy ache.

5028
03:53:35,570 --> 03:53:39,090
But for some reason, the ones in that area seem to be much bigger than that.

5029
03:53:39,370 --> 03:53:40,910
Ah, it's for the game.

5030
03:53:41,170 --> 03:53:42,610
So you can see it on the map.

5031
03:53:44,770 --> 03:53:45,210
Pomeleotoxin.

5032
03:53:45,210 --> 03:53:48,290
Long ago, people used the poison to coat their arrows for hunting.

5033
03:53:48,750 --> 03:53:51,650
Watch out, because if you eat one, you get food poisoning.

5034
03:53:53,050 --> 03:53:53,410
Watch out, because if you eat one, you get food poisoning.

5035
03:53:53,410 --> 03:53:53,710
It's okay.

5036
03:53:53,830 --> 03:53:56,330
If I eat it and then I spin around and throw up, I'll be fine.

5037
03:53:57,310 --> 03:53:59,370
Oh wait, my stamina is like full.

5038
03:53:59,570 --> 03:53:59,690
Oh wait, my stamina is like full.

5039
03:53:59,690 --> 03:54:00,630
I don't know if we can eat it.

5040
03:54:04,170 --> 03:54:05,310
We'll hold on to him.

5041
03:54:06,510 --> 03:54:08,390
They might get hungry, the guys.

5042
03:54:08,530 --> 03:54:10,530
They might be like, oh my gosh, free frog!

5043
03:54:10,810 --> 03:54:12,190
And eat it and then die.

5044
03:54:12,670 --> 03:54:13,490
That might happen.

5045
03:54:15,990 --> 03:54:19,970
In versions of MGS3, with trophies and achievements, you gotta eat the poison now.

5046
03:54:22,450 --> 03:54:23,090
Oh, wait.

5047
03:54:23,270 --> 03:54:24,410
I don't want this.

5048
03:54:27,250 --> 03:54:27,950
Let's save.

5049
03:54:29,070 --> 03:54:30,010
You wanna save?

5050
03:54:30,370 --> 03:54:31,270
Hold on a sec.

5051
03:54:31,570 --> 03:54:32,050
Yeah.

5052
03:54:32,170 --> 03:54:33,050
I'm starting to get hungry.

5053
03:54:33,810 --> 03:54:35,850
Oh my gosh, it's already been almost four hours.

5054
03:54:38,150 --> 03:54:39,790
I wanna get through...

5055
03:54:41,670 --> 03:54:42,150
Hmm...

5056
03:54:43,990 --> 03:54:44,810
I can't...

5057
03:54:44,810 --> 03:54:46,390
This part of the game always...

5058
03:54:46,390 --> 03:54:47,630
I can't remember.

5059
03:54:48,290 --> 03:54:49,590
I know the fear is next.

5060
03:54:52,470 --> 03:54:52,950
Um...

5061
03:54:53,530 --> 03:54:54,230
Hey, Snake.

5062
03:54:54,510 --> 03:54:56,090
Have you ever seen Forbidden Planet?

5063
03:54:56,730 --> 03:54:57,970
Maybe I'll order a pizza.

5064
03:54:58,690 --> 03:55:03,650
It's about this expedition that goes to the planet Altair IV in an ultra-fast spaceship.

5065
03:55:03,930 --> 03:55:08,050
When they arrive, they meet the survivor of the last expedition, Dr. Morbius.

5066
03:55:08,910 --> 03:55:12,470
Dr. Morbius was exploring the planet along with his daughter, Altaira.

5067
03:55:13,490 --> 03:55:14,250
There while Robby the robot.

5068
03:55:15,350 --> 03:55:21,210
Ignoring the doctors' warnings, The expedition team is suddenly attacked by an invisible creature called the Monster from the Id.

5069
03:55:21,830 --> 03:55:24,910
The special effects they use for the science stuff were really neat.

5070
03:55:25,150 --> 03:55:28,610
I wish I had a robot like Robby that could make anything I wanted it to.

5071
03:55:29,210 --> 03:55:31,530
I'm more interested in that invisible monster.

5072
03:55:31,990 --> 03:55:37,430
If I were invisible, I wouldn't have to bother hiding Getting on it.

5073
03:55:37,430 --> 03:55:37,910
Invent it.

5074
03:55:40,710 --> 03:55:43,470
Morbin, Morbius,原因 чтобы uncle.

5075
03:55:46,550 --> 03:55:54,110
I was so busy at the Papa John's that I didn't even notice.

5076
03:55:54,430 --> 03:55:56,390
It mentioned more billion dollars.

5077
03:56:02,630 --> 03:56:04,030
Let's see, what's over here?

5078
03:56:06,650 --> 03:56:07,330
I

5079
03:56:24,150 --> 03:56:25,410
didn't even need it.

5080
03:56:27,970 --> 03:56:28,910
It's messed up.

5081
03:56:32,870 --> 03:56:34,050
It's messed up.

5082
03:56:35,430 --> 03:56:37,370
That will never not be funny.

5083
03:56:40,150 --> 03:56:43,570
You guys are sadists.

5084
03:56:44,670 --> 03:56:45,870
Sadists, all of you.

5085
03:56:46,250 --> 03:56:48,110
I'm gonna run out of bandages and...

5086
03:56:50,770 --> 03:56:51,810
The timing?

5087
03:56:52,070 --> 03:56:52,730
What did you say?

5088
03:56:53,270 --> 03:56:54,310
Oh Snake, be careful.

5089
03:56:54,410 --> 03:56:55,530
There are claymore mines around.

5090
03:56:59,570 --> 03:57:00,190
What?

5091
03:57:02,250 --> 03:57:04,870
Hold on, I actually do want to order pizza.

5092
03:57:09,510 --> 03:57:12,670
I'm ordering pizza menu.

5093

03:57:30,470 --> 03:57:31,130
No, no, no.

5096
03:57:32,950 --> 03:57:33,370

5097
03:57:33,450 --> 03:57:37,170
Okay, I'm gonna put on this.

5098
03:57:38,470 --> 03:57:40,790

I don't want to just order a pizza and it be so expensive.

03:57:58,890 --> 03:57:59,970

5108
03:58:03,450 --> 03:58:04,090
Free delivery?

5109
03:58:04,370 --> 03:58:04,610
Oh.

5110
03:58:06,390 --> 03:58:07,790
Yeah, I have to spend a certain amount.

5111
03:58:09,230 --> 03:58:10,090

03:58:10,730 --> 03:58:12,330

03:58:15,690 --> 03:58:16,950
Oh, I'm getting really hungry.

5117
03:58:17,030 --> 03:58:18,210
Okay, I might have to have a snack.

5118
03:58:18,930 --> 03:58:20,730
You guys might have to have like a little snack break.

5119
03:58:22,630 --> 03:58:23,470
Pineapple and green pepper?

5120
03:58:26,790 --> 03:58:27,110
No?

5121
03:58:41,420 --> 03:58:41,740
Anchovies.

5122
03:58:41,740 --> 03:58:44,540
I had anchovies for the first time not too long ago.

5123
03:58:45,300 --> 03:58:46,160
And you know what?

5124
03:58:46,160 --> 03:58:47,180
I didn't hate it.

5125
03:58:50,260 --> 03:58:51,380
I didn't hate it.

5126
03:58:51,780 --> 03:58:53,420
Wait, how many can I put on?

5127
03:58:53,640 --> 03:58:54,200
How many?

5128
03:58:55,420 --> 03:58:57,080
I can't add deal to cart.

5129
03:58:57,160 --> 03:58:59,380
I can't remember how many toppings I said I could do.

5130
03:59:00,440 --> 03:59:01,140
No, thanks.

5131
03:59:03,500 --> 03:59:04,180
Oh, okay.

5132
03:59:04,260 --> 03:59:04,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5133
03:59:06,760 --> 03:59:08,660
Actually, I'm gonna edit it then.

5134
03:59:08,800 --> 03:59:10,720
I can get one more.

5135
03:59:18,610 --> 03:59:18,970
Yeah,

5136
03:59:23,440 --> 03:59:24,000
this should be good.

5137
03:59:26,460 --> 03:59:26,820
Update.

5138
03:59:29,260 --> 03:59:30,520
I'm like literally...

5139
03:59:31,580 --> 03:59:32,700
My mouth is watering.

5140
03:59:33,460 --> 03:59:34,340
I'm so hungry.

5141
03:59:35,140 --> 03:59:36,900
Oh, I'm so hungry thinking about this.

5142
03:59:36,980 --> 03:59:38,580
Wait, why is the total more than...

5143
03:59:38,580 --> 03:59:39,040
Okay, hold on.

5144
03:59:39,060 --> 03:59:39,780
I think I messed up.

5145
03:59:40,240 --> 03:59:41,340
Wait, no, not replace.

5146
03:59:41,880 --> 03:59:42,840
Hold on, you guys.

5147
03:59:42,880 --> 03:59:43,680
I messed up my order.

5148
03:59:44,080 --> 03:59:44,620
Hold on.

5149
03:59:44,680 --> 03:59:45,760
Sorry, I'm ordering pizza.

5150
03:59:45,820 --> 03:59:46,520
I'm ordering pizza.

5151
03:59:46,520 --> 03:59:48,660
If anybody is curious, I'm ordering pizza.

5152
03:59:50,900 --> 03:59:52,020
It's pineapple on pizza.

5153

Everyone likes it.

5154
03:59:52,920 --> 03:59:53,620
You guys want a slice?

5155
03:59:54,320 --> 03:59:55,080
Pineapple on pizza?

Okay, the coupon worked.

5161
04:00:03,680 --> 04:00:04,220
The coupon worked.

5162
04:00:04,820 --> 04:00:05,220
Okay.

5163
04:00:09,570 --> 04:00:10,370

Oh, here we go.

04:00:17,050 --> 04:00:18,430
I'm so hungry.

5168
04:00:19,470 --> 04:00:20,550
I'm so hungry.

5169
04:00:20,710 --> 04:00:21,610
Okay, a tip.

5170
04:00:26,920 --> 04:00:27,440

Okay,

5173
04:00:44,820 --> 04:00:45,340
I ordered it.

5174
04:00:45,660 --> 04:00:47,040
Free pizza is free...

5175
04:00:47,040 --> 04:00:48,860
It's not free, but...

5176
04:00:48,860 --> 04:00:50,020
That's okay.

5177
04:00:51,660 --> 04:00:52,180
Okay.

5178
04:00:58,700 --> 04:01:00,140
I need a snack, though.

5179
04:01:00,320 --> 04:01:01,340
I need a snack.

5180
04:01:01,340 --> 04:01:02,640
I'm sorry, guys.

5181
04:01:02,840 --> 04:01:03,420
Can I...

5182
04:01:03,420 --> 04:01:07,920
I'm gonna go grab something.

5183
04:01:08,900 --> 04:01:09,980
Maybe some crackers.

5184
04:01:10,700 --> 04:01:11,360
Real quick.

5185
04:01:11,940 --> 04:01:13,820
I'm starting to get all shaky, you know.

5186
04:01:16,500 --> 04:01:18,260
Take a break.

5187
04:01:18,620 --> 04:01:19,720
Take a break, everyone.

5188
04:01:20,380 --> 04:01:20,940
I'll be...

5189
04:01:20,940 --> 04:01:21,600
I'll try to be fast.

5190
04:01:22,880 --> 04:01:23,780
I'll try to be fast.

5191
04:01:23,840 --> 04:01:24,360
I'll try to be quick.

5192
04:01:27,820 --> 04:01:31,100
Do a Google search for free pizza and Metallica MP3.

5193
04:01:31,100 --> 04:01:31,920
What does...

5194
04:01:31,920 --> 04:01:32,200
What?

5195
04:01:33,140 --> 04:01:34,560
Real survival mode.

5196
04:01:38,540 --> 04:01:40,360
Just gonna eat more R fruit.

5197
04:01:40,540 --> 04:01:42,160
Yeah, I'm gonna eat R fruit right now.

5198
04:01:42,960 --> 04:01:43,740
Peanut butter?

5199
04:01:43,900 --> 04:01:45,140
Wait, that's a great idea.

5200
04:01:45,380 --> 04:01:46,400
I'm gonna go eat peanut butter.

5201
04:01:46,560 --> 04:01:47,520
I'll be right back.

5202
04:01:48,760 --> 04:01:49,460
I'm gonna...

5203
04:01:49,460 --> 04:01:50,600
Here, I'll leave you with a...

5204
04:01:53,540 --> 04:01:54,320
Here we go.

5205
04:01:54,540 --> 04:01:54,980
Uniform.

5206
04:01:56,160 --> 04:01:57,220
Going with the tea.

5207
04:02:01,100 --> 04:02:02,600
And then make it a little bit cursed.

5208
04:02:05,880 --> 04:02:07,560
Wait, you can see the top of his head.

5209
04:02:10,120 --> 04:02:11,820
Got any bald spots up there?

5210
04:02:15,740 --> 04:02:16,640
Oh, hold on.

5211
04:02:16,740 --> 04:02:18,200
I can't control this thing.

5212
04:02:18,300 --> 04:02:19,580
Oh my gosh, everything's inverted.

5213
04:02:22,400 --> 04:02:23,100
Oh, no!

5214
04:02:28,390 --> 04:02:29,070
There you go.

5215
04:02:30,770 --> 04:02:31,550
I'll be right back.

5216
04:02:32,030 --> 04:02:32,850
I'm so sorry.

5217
04:02:32,970 --> 04:02:34,630
I'll be like just a few minutes.

5218
04:02:35,810 --> 04:02:36,450
Let me...

5219
04:02:36,450 --> 04:02:37,490
Let me also put on some like...

5220
04:02:37,490 --> 04:02:38,010
Oh, wait.

5221
04:02:38,070 --> 04:02:39,270
If I put on music, you won't hear it.

5222
04:02:44,050 --> 04:02:48,810
Wait, can I even access my music?

5223
04:02:49,610 --> 04:02:50,010
No.

5224
04:02:51,710 --> 04:02:52,490
Everything is bad.

5225
04:03:02,830 --> 04:03:06,030
Now, just think of that melody and repeat it like 50 times.

5226
04:04:15,230 --> 04:04:16,110
Guys.

5227
04:04:16,690 --> 04:04:20,910
You will never believe what I found in my cabinet.

5228
04:04:22,450 --> 04:04:23,990
You'll never believe.

5229
04:04:24,410 --> 04:04:25,970
You'll never believe.

5230
04:04:26,090 --> 04:04:27,710
You'll never believe it is the most appropriate...

5231
04:04:27,710 --> 04:04:29,690
Snack for...

5232
04:04:31,430 --> 04:04:33,410
For Metal Gear.

5233
04:04:34,010 --> 04:04:34,890
Hey!

5234
04:04:41,350 --> 04:04:43,290
I got a Calry98.

5235
04:04:44,330 --> 04:04:46,230
A R ett It's just...

5236
04:04:46,230 --> 04:04:47,090
In my pantry?

5237
04:04:47,230 --> 04:04:48,010
That would be so sad.

5238
04:04:49,250 --> 04:04:50,010
Can you imagine?

5239
04:04:50,090 --> 04:04:50,530
A frog?

5240
04:04:50,730 --> 04:04:52,150
That would be horrifying.

5241
04:04:52,210 --> 04:04:53,950
I think I would prefer the rat over the frog.

5242
04:04:55,510 --> 04:04:56,130
Calorie Mate!

5243
04:04:56,450 --> 04:04:56,810
Okay.

5244
04:04:56,930 --> 04:05:00,450
It's not what I want, but since pizza's coming, I'll just hold out.

5245
04:05:00,790 --> 04:05:02,170
Wait, I forgot to get more drink!

5246
04:05:03,110 --> 04:05:04,050
I gotta get more tea.

5247
04:05:04,710 --> 04:05:05,370
Yeah, hold on.

5248
04:05:06,910 --> 04:05:07,270
Someday...

5249
04:05:07,710 --> 04:05:09,070
Okay, it's fruit flavored.

5250
04:05:09,310 --> 04:05:11,370
I don't think I've ever tried the fruit flavored one before.

5251
04:05:13,010 --> 04:05:13,370
Okay.

5252
04:05:14,130 --> 04:05:15,390
I'm gonna try it.

5253
04:05:16,910 --> 04:05:18,450
Fruit flavored Calorie Mate.

5254
04:05:28,460 --> 04:05:29,000
Tasty!

5255
04:05:30,320 --> 04:05:31,440
Wait, oh gosh!

5256
04:05:31,560 --> 04:05:33,020
I'm eating this without a drink!

5257
04:05:33,700 --> 04:05:35,000
It's so dry!

5258
04:05:39,840 --> 04:05:41,700
Can I go get a drink?

5259
04:06:37,960 --> 04:06:38,500
Okay.

5260
04:06:40,420 --> 04:06:45,340
It says it's fruit flavored, but it's like heavy on the pineapple.

5261
04:06:45,960 --> 04:06:46,720
Nom nom.

5262
04:06:48,240 --> 04:06:48,800
Alright.

5263
04:06:50,420 --> 04:06:50,980
Alright.

5264
04:06:51,980 --> 04:06:53,640
This VTuber is deceased?

5265
04:06:53,740 --> 04:06:54,660
What are you talking about?

5266
04:06:57,800 --> 04:06:58,580
I'm back.

5267
04:06:58,780 --> 04:07:00,960
Let me eat a little bit more Calorie Mate.

5268
04:07:01,240 --> 04:07:02,220
How appropriate.

5269
04:07:08,000 --> 04:07:10,140
I will put it on my pizza.

5270
04:07:14,940 --> 04:07:15,440
Okay.

5271
04:07:18,570 --> 04:07:19,990
I'm not wasting more time.

5272
04:07:21,890 --> 04:07:23,390
Oh, let's also change?

5273
04:07:34,290 --> 04:07:37,030
I'm just like, yeah, I'm coming in as shirtless Raiden.

5274
04:07:37,310 --> 04:07:37,910
Let's go.

5275
04:07:38,110 --> 04:07:40,330
My stamina bar is high, baby.

5276
04:07:43,130 --> 04:07:44,270
I'm good and healthy.

5277
04:07:52,100 --> 04:07:52,600
Wait.

5278
04:07:52,980 --> 04:07:53,880
Do I have space?

5279
04:07:58,810 --> 04:07:59,310
Whoa!

5280
04:08:02,070 --> 04:08:03,630
Where is Kero-tan?

5281
04:08:06,490 --> 04:08:07,710
Where could he be?

5282
04:08:07,950 --> 04:08:09,170
In this area.

5283
04:08:11,910 --> 04:08:13,110
Closure room's out.

5284
04:08:15,010 --> 04:08:16,350
Back here at the beginning?

5285
04:08:18,390 --> 04:08:19,830
Kero-taaaaaaan!

5286
04:08:22,530 --> 04:08:23,970
Kero-taaaaaaan!

5287
04:08:26,620 --> 04:08:28,060
Are you hissing at me?

5288
04:08:28,300 --> 04:08:28,740
Oh!

5289
04:08:30,040 --> 04:08:31,160
Stay away.

5290
04:08:32,240 --> 04:08:32,960
Wait.

5291
04:08:34,200 --> 04:08:36,100
Did I go this way?

5292
04:08:46,360 --> 04:08:47,880
Oh, that's where I blew up.

5293
04:08:48,120 --> 04:08:48,820
That's right.

5294
04:08:50,460 --> 04:08:57,520
I'm gonna add the reverb for the, um, you know, the ambiance.

5295
04:09:01,660 --> 04:09:02,620
This way.

5296
04:09:04,500 --> 04:09:05,060
Oh!

5297
04:09:05,480 --> 04:09:06,040
Oh!

5298
04:09:07,900 --> 04:09:08,460
This...

5299
04:09:09,520 --> 04:09:10,080
Oh!

5300
04:09:10,700 --> 04:09:11,260
Oh!

5301
04:09:15,380 --> 04:09:15,860
Oh!

5302
04:09:21,590 --> 04:09:22,070
Glow.

5303
04:09:26,790 --> 04:09:27,630
Where is Kero-tan?

5304
04:09:31,310 --> 04:09:32,110
Hey, Bloco.

5305
04:09:32,410 --> 04:09:32,890
Momoko.

5306
04:09:36,700 --> 04:09:37,180
Duh.

5307
04:09:43,320 --> 04:09:44,120
I give up.

5308
04:09:44,900 --> 04:09:46,480
I give up trying to find him.

5309
04:09:50,150 --> 04:09:50,950
Oh my gosh.

5310
04:09:52,250 --> 04:09:53,130
Into the piss!

5311
04:09:57,330 --> 04:09:58,030
Spider-man.

5312
04:10:07,040 --> 04:10:07,660
Aww.

5313
04:10:08,100 --> 04:10:08,920
Yeah, baby.

5314
04:10:11,980 --> 04:10:15,860
It's a good thing we've got our craw cat here.

5315
04:10:17,520 --> 04:10:17,580
Hmm.

5316
04:10:17,800 --> 04:10:18,120
Hmm.

5317
04:10:19,240 --> 04:10:19,860
Hum.

5318
04:10:20,720 --> 04:10:20,980
Hum.

5319
04:10:20,980 --> 04:10:21,360
Hum.

5320
04:10:21,380 --> 04:10:21,940
Hum.

5321
04:10:23,620 --> 04:10:24,520
Da-da-da.

5322
04:10:24,680 --> 04:10:25,300
Tiger.

5323
04:10:27,740 --> 04:10:27,880
Oh.

5324
04:10:28,000 --> 04:10:28,600
Water.

5325
04:10:29,380 --> 04:10:30,000
That

5326
04:10:55,850 --> 04:10:56,330
was so close.

5327
04:10:56,550 --> 04:10:58,070
That was so close.

5328
04:11:00,110 --> 04:11:00,730
Alright.

5329
04:11:28,350 --> 04:11:29,270
Oh my god!

5330
04:11:29,590 --> 04:11:30,370
He's right there!

5331
04:11:33,210 --> 04:11:35,350
The only guy to ever have worn a craw cat.

5332
04:11:37,390 --> 04:11:38,810
Can you think I can knock him off?

5333
04:11:39,730 --> 04:11:41,130
But he's wearing a helmet, isn't he?

5334
04:11:43,770 --> 04:11:44,170
Bye!

5335
04:11:48,080 --> 04:11:49,320
I wanna get that trap grenade.

5336
04:11:58,030 --> 04:11:59,210
I don't think the...

5337
04:11:59,210 --> 04:11:59,650
Oh, wait.

5338
04:11:59,690 --> 04:12:00,950
I have to add it back to my...

5339
04:12:00,950 --> 04:12:01,550
Let's see.

5340
04:12:03,410 --> 04:12:04,390
I feel that...

5341
04:12:05,670 --> 04:12:07,730
The platform will crash and make noise.

5342
04:12:08,570 --> 04:12:09,510
Okay, okay.

5343
04:12:10,190 --> 04:12:29,690
I feel that the hovercrafts don't make me so like side-eyed just because like you go from this to all the stuff in V and you know, I know V is like 10 years later but...

5344
04:12:32,850 --> 04:12:33,230
I don't know.

5345
04:12:33,390 --> 04:12:35,090
How is she gonna handle the scene coming up?

5346
04:12:35,830 --> 04:12:37,090
I will let him live.

5347
04:12:38,930 --> 04:12:39,510
Don't worry.

5348
04:12:39,570 --> 04:12:40,370
I'll let him live.

5349
04:12:40,630 --> 04:12:41,290
I'll let him live.

5350
04:12:43,230 --> 04:12:44,410
It's just the one way, right?

5351
04:12:44,510 --> 04:12:46,830
I thought there was another way over here.

5352
04:12:47,810 --> 04:12:48,570
I think.

5353
04:12:48,690 --> 04:12:49,550
I thought so, right?

5354
04:12:49,990 --> 04:12:50,550
Over here?

5355
04:12:52,070 --> 04:12:52,450
Yeah.

5356
04:13:05,190 --> 04:13:07,370
So, you know, it's honestly...

5357
04:13:07,370 --> 04:13:11,550
And also like Metal Gears in general are just so crazy and everything...

5358
04:13:11,550 --> 04:13:13,990
A lot of the tech in this is pretty crazy so I don't mind.

5359
04:13:14,130 --> 04:13:15,510
I don't think it's like so...

5360
04:13:16,490 --> 04:13:19,010
It doesn't throw me so much out of the game.

5361
04:13:19,690 --> 04:13:20,310
You know.

5362
04:13:21,850 --> 04:13:22,430
That's all.

5363
04:13:25,770 --> 04:13:26,510
Oh my gosh.

5364
04:13:27,430 --> 04:13:29,170
Don't just dive like that snake!

5365
04:13:30,590 --> 04:13:31,690
It's scaring me.

5366
04:13:33,330 --> 04:13:34,930
Maybe I should go back to the other side.

5367
04:13:36,150 --> 04:13:37,650
There's nothing really for me to do here.

5368
04:13:38,230 --> 04:13:40,870
I don't want to activate anything on this part.

5369
04:13:41,110 --> 04:13:41,250
Okay.

5370
04:13:42,110 --> 04:13:42,830
We'll go back.

5371
04:13:44,350 --> 04:13:45,490
Goofy like the rest of the game.

5372
04:13:45,650 --> 04:13:46,190
Yeah, exactly.

5373
04:13:50,030 --> 04:13:50,910
SPD is here.

5374
04:13:51,050 --> 04:13:51,130
Oh!

5375
04:13:52,270 --> 04:13:55,890
Well, let's do this part over here first.

5376
04:13:56,470 --> 04:13:57,670
The music is...

5377
04:14:00,430 --> 04:14:01,590
Let's do that first.

5378
04:14:01,750 --> 04:14:02,170
Let's do that first.

5379
04:14:02,170 --> 04:14:03,050
And then we'll...

5380
04:14:04,310 --> 04:14:05,170
Like over here?

5381
04:14:05,530 --> 04:14:06,670
And then I can come back.

5382
04:14:11,620 --> 04:14:12,700
Here we go!

5383
04:14:14,180 --> 04:14:15,940
I love a crocodile!

5384
04:14:20,780 --> 04:14:26,340
Speaking from a technological viewpoint, the Shuggle Hut is more possible in current time than the other units.

5385
04:14:28,860 --> 04:14:29,600
Maybe, yeah.

5386
04:14:29,620 --> 04:14:30,100
I guess so.

5387
04:14:31,480 --> 04:14:33,860
The other units are literally like baby Gundam.

5388
04:14:38,560 --> 04:14:46,740
So it's funny how like things are so of their time period in the games, but then you just have like some of this crazy technology.

5389
04:14:48,400 --> 04:14:50,300
I was one of the guards trying...

5390
04:14:52,440 --> 04:14:53,000
Sokolov!

5391
04:14:53,880 --> 04:14:54,440
Volgen!

5392
04:14:55,520 --> 04:14:56,480
Hot lady.

5393
04:15:00,680 --> 04:15:01,480
Oh my god!

5394
04:15:02,340 --> 04:15:02,900
Sokolov!

5395
04:15:07,660 --> 04:15:08,140
Volgen!

5396
04:15:08,140 --> 04:15:08,140
Volgen!

5397
04:15:08,140 --> 04:15:10,260
You better not pee your pants, you little baby.

5398
04:15:11,240 --> 04:15:11,720
...

5399
04:15:11,720 --> 04:15:11,780
...

5400
04:15:13,300 --> 04:15:13,780
...

5401
04:15:13,780 --> 04:15:14,360
...

5402
04:15:14,360 --> 04:15:14,940
...

5403
04:15:14,940 --> 04:15:14,960
...

5404
04:15:14,960 --> 04:15:14,980
...

5405
04:15:14,980 --> 04:15:15,060
...

5406
04:15:25,070 --> 04:15:25,550
Tanya!

5407
04:15:25,710 --> 04:15:26,070
That's right.

5408
04:15:26,150 --> 04:15:26,750
That's her name.

5409
04:15:26,850 --> 04:15:27,110
That's right.

5410
04:15:29,010 --> 04:15:30,330
I couldn't remember her name.

5411
04:15:30,570 --> 04:15:30,970
Tanya!

5412
04:15:35,810 --> 04:15:36,770
Vol'gin!

5413
04:15:39,230 --> 04:15:40,190
Vol'gin!

5414
04:15:43,430 --> 04:15:44,150
Oh my god.

5415
04:15:53,360 --> 04:15:54,700
She looks like a little puppet.

5416
04:16:07,670 --> 04:16:10,470
Vol'gin, you monster!

5417
04:16:15,180 --> 04:16:16,220
Utter booby.

5418
04:16:23,000 --> 04:16:23,920
Necklace.

5419
04:16:25,100 --> 04:16:27,740
Oh god, it spat everywhere.

5420
04:16:28,500 --> 04:16:31,680
They make it so obvious.

5421
04:16:32,020 --> 04:16:33,780
Oh my god.

5422
04:16:35,320 --> 04:16:37,460
Let's find out just how lucky you are.

5423
04:16:38,400 --> 04:16:39,820
I like this part.

5424
04:16:41,340 --> 04:16:42,460
Watch closely.

5425
04:16:45,740 --> 04:16:50,620
This is Ocelot getting his little, his little grippers in torture, you know?

5426
04:16:50,900 --> 04:16:56,140
Starting to realize he kind of likes watching people, you know, tremble a little bit.

5427
04:16:56,140 --> 04:16:58,580
One of these three guns has a single bullet in it.

5428
04:16:59,760 --> 04:17:02,800
I'm going to pull the trigger six times in a row.

5429
04:17:03,420 --> 04:17:04,380
Are you ready?

5430
04:17:04,380 --> 04:17:05,700
It's actually pretty good odds though.

5431
04:17:15,040 --> 04:17:17,140
Uh, it's, it's in the cup on...

5432
04:17:23,020 --> 04:17:23,740
Look at him.

5433
04:17:23,760 --> 04:17:24,280
Look at him.

5434
04:17:24,380 --> 04:17:25,080
He's like...

5435
04:17:26,100 --> 04:17:27,720
Don't pee your pants, little baby.

5436
04:17:28,560 --> 04:17:29,980
What did I tell you?

5437
04:17:32,540 --> 04:17:34,820
Looks like your luck hasn't run out yet.

5438
04:17:36,940 --> 04:17:37,420
No!

5439
04:17:40,420 --> 04:17:42,600
You guys, do you realize for...

5440
04:17:42,600 --> 04:17:42,680
No!

5441
04:17:42,680 --> 04:17:45,300
In terms of the Metal Gear Solid series, that's three for three.

5442
04:17:47,180 --> 04:17:47,900
That's crazy.

5443
04:17:48,100 --> 04:17:50,860
The boss is so cool.

5444
04:17:52,500 --> 04:17:53,420
Yes, mommy.

5445
04:18:03,920 --> 04:18:05,460
Almost like a recurring theme.

5446
04:18:06,800 --> 04:18:08,460
I think it's like a...

5447
04:18:09,220 --> 04:18:11,920
You know how little kids just think that's funny?

5448
04:18:16,740 --> 04:18:17,520
Dismantle his gun.

5449
04:18:19,640 --> 04:18:20,280
Ooh.

5450
04:18:26,640 --> 04:18:27,280
Dummy.

5451
04:18:28,460 --> 04:18:30,740
The necklace is... so...

5452
04:18:32,740 --> 04:18:36,000
Has the CIA dog been disposed of yet?

5453
04:18:37,600 --> 04:18:39,140
The pain is dead.

5454
04:18:39,400 --> 04:18:40,440
The pain is dead.

5455
04:18:40,680 --> 04:18:41,260
What?

5456
04:18:41,760 --> 04:18:42,580
Uh-oh.

5457
04:18:53,740 --> 04:18:55,320
He may be a child.

5458
04:18:56,100 --> 04:18:57,500
But he's definitely one of yours.

5459
04:18:57,920 --> 04:18:58,300
Ooh.

5460
04:19:02,360 --> 04:19:03,540
I'm just that good.

5461
04:19:05,900 --> 04:19:07,020
I'm just that good.

5462
04:19:09,440 --> 04:19:12,240
I fear Khrushchev may have a hand in this.

5463
04:19:12,980 --> 04:19:14,320
We have no time to lose.

5464
04:19:14,560 --> 04:19:16,580
You must eliminate him before the final test.

5465
04:19:19,200 --> 04:19:20,680
She's like rolling his eyes.

5466
04:19:20,920 --> 04:19:21,940
She's like, okay.

5467
04:19:22,020 --> 04:19:23,680
Rolling her eyes.

5468
04:19:23,900 --> 04:19:24,000
Oh!

5469
04:19:24,000 --> 04:19:24,100
Oh!

5470
04:19:24,380 --> 04:19:25,440
There he is!

5471
04:19:29,110 --> 04:19:29,950
The end.

5472
04:19:34,790 --> 04:19:35,550
Wake up, old man.

5473
04:19:35,550 --> 04:19:36,330
I'm leaving him to you.

5474
04:19:36,530 --> 04:19:37,130
The fear.

5475
04:19:37,710 --> 04:19:38,270
Ah!

5476
04:19:40,810 --> 04:19:41,370
Yah!

5477
04:19:42,350 --> 04:19:42,910
Yeah!

5478
04:19:44,910 --> 04:19:49,370
He's just being a little freak over there.

5479
04:19:51,050 --> 04:19:52,110
Take the shot.

5480
04:19:52,410 --> 04:19:52,630
No!

5481
04:19:53,030 --> 04:19:54,010
It's no fun.

5482
04:19:54,130 --> 04:19:55,410
The old man is always sleeping.

5483
04:19:55,710 --> 04:19:56,550
Is he all right?

5484
04:19:56,550 --> 04:19:56,910
It's no fun.

5485
04:19:57,170 --> 04:19:57,610
It's no fun.

5486
04:19:58,430 --> 04:20:01,190
If I were playing, like, by myself, I'd do it, probably.

5487
04:20:01,650 --> 04:20:02,490
I'd try at least.

5488
04:20:02,730 --> 04:20:03,830
Normally, he's dead.

5489
04:20:05,970 --> 04:20:07,070
I'm not gonna take the shot.

5490
04:20:07,410 --> 04:20:08,050
But he'll wake up when the time is right.

5491
04:20:10,670 --> 04:20:12,110
I'm not gonna take the shot.

5492
04:20:14,430 --> 04:20:17,970
And when he does, it will be the end for the...

5493
04:20:17,970 --> 04:20:24,130
The last time I played this, I had actually not such a bad time with the end fight, so I'm curious how it will be for me this time.

5494
04:20:24,370 --> 04:20:26,530
I think I lucked out a lot before this one.

5495
04:20:26,530 --> 04:20:30,390
It was fun.

5496
04:20:30,390 --> 04:20:32,290
Sokolov isn't worth your love.

5497
04:20:33,110 --> 04:20:33,750
Oh...

5498
04:20:33,750 --> 04:20:35,770
Are you trying to woo me?

5499
04:20:35,970 --> 04:20:38,070
You can entertain me until the rain stops.

5500
04:20:40,170 --> 04:20:43,030
Volga's not here for love, he's here for a freak.

5501
04:20:46,230 --> 04:20:47,110
Oh, yah!

5502
04:20:47,310 --> 04:20:47,730
Oh!

5503
04:20:49,790 --> 04:20:50,430
Volgan!

5504
04:20:50,630 --> 04:20:51,570
Koawah barrah.

5505
04:20:51,650 --> 04:20:52,410
Koawah barrah.

5506
04:20:52,590 --> 04:20:53,250
Koawah barrah.

5507
04:20:54,150 --> 04:20:54,790
Oh...

5508
04:20:54,790 --> 04:20:55,730
I feeling the pain.

5509
04:20:56,150 --> 04:20:56,510
Oh...

5510
04:20:56,530 --> 04:20:57,950
He's here for the nasty.

5511
04:20:58,210 --> 04:20:59,310
He's not here for love.

5512
04:21:00,370 --> 04:21:01,950
Maybe he does love them though.

5513
04:21:02,030 --> 04:21:04,390
In his own little, weird, sadistic, freaky way.

5514
04:21:04,630 --> 04:21:05,530
We don't know.

5515
04:21:18,340 --> 04:21:20,260
Just leave this guy sleeping.

5516
04:21:23,280 --> 04:21:24,400
Okay, old man.

5517
04:21:33,270 --> 04:21:35,390
I'm not gonna kill the end, you guys.

5518
04:21:35,490 --> 04:21:36,470
I'm not gonna do it.

5519
04:21:36,490 --> 04:21:37,250
I'm not gonna do it.

5520
04:21:37,750 --> 04:21:38,770
I know I can.

5521
04:21:39,990 --> 04:21:42,930
Actually, I don't even have a... I don't even have a... like a...

5522
04:21:43,810 --> 04:21:46,910
I didn't grab a... like a... a sniper.

5523
04:21:48,810 --> 04:21:49,230
Yeah.

5524
04:21:50,190 --> 04:21:51,930
But I... I can't...

5525
04:21:52,870 --> 04:21:55,510
I don't... I didn't even pick it up in that other area.

5526
04:21:55,710 --> 04:21:56,730
But seriously...

5527
04:21:57,390 --> 04:21:58,950
Stop yelling at me to do it.

5528
04:21:58,970 --> 04:21:59,490
Because that's what I'm doing.

5529
04:21:59,510 --> 04:22:01,330
It's not fun to kill him right now.

5530
04:22:01,870 --> 04:22:02,670
It's not fun.

5531
04:22:05,390 --> 04:22:05,750
Gosh.

5532
04:22:07,470 --> 04:22:09,450
Told you the SVD was in the other place.

5533
04:22:09,570 --> 04:22:09,770
I know.

5534
04:22:10,510 --> 04:22:13,070
And I said I wasn't... I was gonna go back and get it.

5535
04:22:14,810 --> 04:22:15,830
I didn't need it.

5536
04:22:15,890 --> 04:22:16,950
Because I wasn't gonna kill him!

5537
04:22:19,630 --> 04:22:19,990
Gosh.

5538
04:22:22,910 --> 04:22:24,450
It's fun if you save and do it.

5539
04:22:24,510 --> 04:22:25,510
Yeah, but I didn't even grab it.

5540
04:22:28,370 --> 04:22:29,070
I wonder...

5541
04:22:29,510 --> 04:22:30,330
Is it time to go back and get it?

5542
04:22:31,250 --> 04:22:33,350
He like... he disappears so fast though.

5543
04:22:47,880 --> 04:22:49,080
Why you no shoot?

5544
04:22:51,660 --> 04:22:52,800
I always fought him.

5545
04:22:53,360 --> 04:22:59,240
I don't know why people are so... like... weird about that part in particular.

5546
04:23:01,000 --> 04:23:02,740
Like they get so like...

5547
04:23:02,740 --> 04:23:03,880
You must...

5548
04:23:03,880 --> 04:23:09,740
You must shoot at him or else...

5549
04:23:09,740 --> 04:23:10,460
It's...

5550
04:23:10,460 --> 04:23:11,780
You know...

5551
04:23:13,360 --> 04:23:14,320
Or else...

5552
04:23:15,040 --> 04:23:16,340
You're not playing the game.

5553
04:23:17,040 --> 04:23:19,480
If you grab the early sniper, you can kill Chen.

5554
04:23:26,880 --> 04:23:28,820
People just like using exploits.

5555
04:23:29,440 --> 04:23:29,920
Maybe.

5556
04:23:30,040 --> 04:23:31,440
Maybe that is why.

5557
04:23:33,080 --> 04:23:33,700
Oh wait.

5558
04:23:33,800 --> 04:23:34,220
Hold on.

5559
04:23:37,640 --> 04:23:38,580
Oh my gosh.

5560
04:23:38,640 --> 04:23:39,120
Stop Snake.

5561
04:23:39,300 --> 04:23:40,340
I just want you to...

5562
04:23:40,340 --> 04:23:43,180
I just want you to be normal for a second.

5563
04:23:47,330 --> 04:23:48,310
Besides this guy,

5564
04:23:52,090 --> 04:23:52,890
We have...

5565
04:23:53,650 --> 04:23:54,830
Oh, it's so hard to tell.

5566
04:23:54,950 --> 04:23:55,450
Oh my gosh.

5567
04:23:55,470 --> 04:23:56,110
There's so many fish.

5568
04:23:57,430 --> 04:23:58,910
There's so many fish, it's hard to tell.

5569
04:24:04,920 --> 04:24:06,380
Also, I forgot my backpack.

5570
04:24:08,780 --> 04:24:10,220
Please save and wait a week.

5571
04:24:11,420 --> 04:24:11,820
Yeah...

5572
04:24:13,080 --> 04:24:15,600
Because I didn't kill him here I'm definitely gonna do that.

5573
04:24:15,840 --> 04:24:16,820
I'm gonna be like, okay.

5574
04:24:18,840 --> 04:24:19,280
Would be awesome.

5575
04:24:19,280 --> 04:24:22,480
I'm just gonna... do that instead.

5576
04:24:25,700 --> 04:24:28,480
Mark 22... only

5577
04:24:32,060 --> 04:24:33,320
7 months to go.

5578
04:24:33,560 --> 04:24:34,680
7 months?

5579
04:24:34,820 --> 04:24:35,680
What's in 7 months?

5580
04:24:40,200 --> 04:24:42,820
Oh that's right, I don't have much left.

5581
04:24:43,400 --> 04:24:45,020
I think I might have to kill this guy.

5582
04:24:48,980 --> 04:24:52,100
The river runs red.

5583
04:25:00,490 --> 04:25:06,790
The river runs red with the blood of the man.

5584
04:25:13,200 --> 04:25:14,280
Emery Red!

5585
04:25:14,660 --> 04:25:15,400
Emery!

5586
04:25:15,620 --> 04:25:16,360
Hello!

5587
04:25:17,580 --> 04:25:18,640
Hello, friends.

5588
04:25:18,980 --> 04:25:19,820
Hello, hello.

5589
04:25:21,080 --> 04:25:22,240
Hello, hello, hello.

5590
04:25:23,080 --> 04:25:24,840
I just killed a man, sorry.

5591
04:25:25,160 --> 04:25:26,200
If you witnessed that.

5592
04:25:28,180 --> 04:25:30,520
If you saw that...

5593
04:25:31,300 --> 04:25:33,240
No, you didn't.

5594
04:25:34,780 --> 04:25:35,380
Oh my god.

5595
04:25:37,440 --> 04:25:38,280
I think that guy's asleep.

5596
04:25:39,800 --> 04:25:40,340
No, he's not.

5597
04:25:40,560 --> 04:25:41,880
I could put him to sleep forever, though.

5598
04:25:43,600 --> 04:25:44,820
I could put him to sleep forever.

5599
04:25:49,670 --> 04:25:51,090
I don't know where the third guy is, though.

5600
04:25:53,110 --> 04:25:53,550
Oh shoot.

5601
04:25:55,790 --> 04:25:56,330
Self-defense?

5602
04:26:04,390 --> 04:26:05,190
I'm just a gator.

5603
04:26:06,330 --> 04:26:07,710
I'm just a... I'm not even a gator.

5604
04:26:07,770 --> 04:26:08,370
I'm just a crocodile.

5605
04:26:10,910 --> 04:26:12,370
Is there even another guy?

5606
04:26:12,530 --> 04:26:13,170
I thought there was.

5607
04:26:13,230 --> 04:26:13,810
I thought there were three.

5608
04:26:18,470 --> 04:26:20,030
The motion detector is impossible.

5609
04:26:21,630 --> 04:26:22,690
In these areas.

5610
04:26:28,260 --> 04:26:33,100
I don't even remember where the thing is.

5611
04:26:34,460 --> 04:26:35,320
Kero-tan!

5612
04:26:37,720 --> 04:26:39,000
We found him, though.

5613
04:26:53,690 --> 04:26:54,670
Is it...

5614
04:26:56,850 --> 04:26:57,870
Just a croc.

5615
04:26:57,870 --> 04:26:58,990
Yeah, just a croc.

5616
04:27:00,330 --> 04:27:01,490
Just a croc.

5617
04:27:01,490 --> 04:27:02,290
I mean, crocs?

5618
04:27:02,650 --> 04:27:05,810
Like they said, the crocs are dangerous.

5619
04:27:05,830 --> 04:27:06,850
They're out for blood.

5620
04:27:07,990 --> 04:27:09,170
What I put on the cap?

5621
04:27:09,670 --> 04:27:14,430
You guys, it just makes me... technically a pacifist run, because no it isn't.

5622
04:27:15,130 --> 04:27:18,810
When I put on the cap, it just makes me wild.

5623
04:27:19,530 --> 04:27:20,750
I can't help it.

5624
04:27:22,490 --> 04:27:24,470
It makes me wild!

5625
04:27:38,590 --> 04:27:40,090
Looking around for items.

5626
04:27:42,630 --> 04:27:44,470
You understand, right guys?

5627
04:27:45,250 --> 04:27:46,350
You understand?

5628
04:27:47,730 --> 04:27:49,190
It's not my fault.

5629
04:27:49,490 --> 04:27:50,650
It's the cap.

5630
04:27:52,230 --> 04:27:53,790
The cap... oh!

5631
04:27:54,250 --> 04:27:54,830
Oops.

5632
04:27:56,450 --> 04:27:59,110
The croc cap changes people.

5633
04:27:59,310 --> 04:28:00,130
Exactly.

5634
04:28:01,250 --> 04:28:02,090
Exactly.

5635
04:28:02,970 --> 04:28:03,790
I want to go in there.

5636
04:28:07,230 --> 04:28:08,870
Did I kill everybody here?

5637
04:28:09,790 --> 04:28:11,230
What the hell is that?

5638
04:28:11,850 --> 04:28:12,330
Squash.

5639
04:28:12,630 --> 04:28:13,110
Ah!

5640
04:28:13,330 --> 04:28:14,050
It poisoned me!

5641
04:28:20,120 --> 04:28:21,700
I wanted to squish it!

5642
04:28:28,010 --> 04:28:29,670
Oh wait, I need the serum.

5643
04:28:29,910 --> 04:28:31,150
Wait, do I need the antidote?

5644
04:28:31,370 --> 04:28:32,010
Oh yeah.

5645
04:28:32,170 --> 04:28:34,190
What's the difference between serum and antidote?

5646
04:28:34,390 --> 04:28:35,710
Oh, this is food poisoning!

5647
04:28:37,830 --> 04:28:38,310
Oops.

5648
04:28:42,630 --> 04:28:43,470
Poison spider.

5649
04:28:47,450 --> 04:28:47,930
Yes!

5650
04:28:47,930 --> 04:28:48,410
Yes!

5651
04:29:00,360 --> 04:29:03,820
Well, if there was any chance of him being alive...

5652
04:29:03,820 --> 04:29:04,860
Wait, where did he... oh, there it is.

5653
04:29:08,360 --> 04:29:08,840
Okay.

5654
04:29:09,080 --> 04:29:09,880
I don't need it.

5655
04:29:13,860 --> 04:29:14,660
I'm hungry.

5656
04:29:17,720 --> 04:29:19,720
Now no one will ever find him.

5657
04:29:19,720 --> 04:29:23,120
Yeah, the fish... I'm feeding the fish pretty much.

5658
04:29:25,420 --> 04:29:26,720
Let's eat a maroon shark!

5659
04:29:31,550 --> 04:29:34,490
Oh no, this is not the bloco.

5660
04:29:36,450 --> 04:29:37,530
Let's eat the crab.

5661
04:29:41,260 --> 04:29:42,780
Hey, this works.

5662
04:29:45,400 --> 04:29:46,820
Let's get back up there.

5663
04:29:49,060 --> 04:29:52,540
I hate how slowly he walks in the water.

5664
04:29:52,540 --> 04:29:55,220
What is... okay, is it behind the door?

5665
04:29:57,280 --> 04:29:58,680
I feel like I'm crazy.

5666
04:30:02,300 --> 04:30:03,000
Excuse me.

5667
04:30:04,440 --> 04:30:06,560
I'm coming to grab your stuff.

5668
04:30:07,200 --> 04:30:08,660
If I blow this up...

5669
04:30:09,220 --> 04:30:10,300
Can I blow this up?

5670
04:30:11,460 --> 04:30:11,900
SVD.

5671
04:30:12,100 --> 04:30:14,280
If I blow this up, does this count as like an armory?

5672
04:30:20,240 --> 04:30:20,680
Yeah?

5673
04:30:20,680 --> 04:30:20,760
Yeah?

5674
04:30:23,620 --> 04:30:25,360
It's a square.

5675
04:30:26,400 --> 04:30:27,140
Bonne joie!

5676
04:30:48,250 --> 04:30:50,430
All right, we got it.

5677
04:30:55,260 --> 04:30:56,060
Perfect.

5678
04:30:57,040 --> 04:30:57,840
Crockett.

5679
04:31:00,080 --> 04:31:02,380
Nobody will ever know.

5680
04:31:03,120 --> 04:31:04,280
Nobody will ever know.

5681
04:31:04,520 --> 04:31:05,320
Mystery.

5682
04:31:07,740 --> 04:31:08,200
Hello?

5683
04:31:08,540 --> 04:31:09,580
Can I get out of here?

5684
04:31:09,840 --> 04:31:10,320
There we go.

5685
04:31:13,080 --> 04:31:14,300
Now dive, snake.

5686
04:31:15,620 --> 04:31:16,080
Dive!

5687
04:31:29,050 --> 04:31:31,590
The sound when you run on the dock is so satisfying.

5688
04:31:31,830 --> 04:31:32,330
It's pretty nice.

5689
04:31:33,430 --> 04:31:35,830
It's like a nice...

5690
04:31:38,710 --> 04:31:39,910
This sound, however.

5691
04:31:41,730 --> 04:31:42,970
I'm gonna save real quick.

5692
04:31:42,970 --> 04:31:43,170
Quick.

5693
04:31:47,070 --> 04:31:48,110
Yeah, save.

5694
04:32:02,820 --> 04:32:03,340
Nice.

5695
04:32:06,380 --> 04:32:07,580
This is the original PS.

5696
04:32:07,620 --> 04:32:10,040
Not the original, it's subsistence, but it is on my PS2.

5697
04:32:10,420 --> 04:32:12,680
The spider?

5698
04:32:16,160 --> 04:32:16,820
A giant monster.

5699
04:32:17,240 --> 04:32:21,980
They bring it into the city in a state of hibernation, but it wakes up and starts wrecking the place.

5700
04:32:22,360 --> 04:32:24,460
So why did the spider turn huge?

5701
04:32:24,860 --> 04:32:25,960
Look at the membership, thank you!

5702
04:32:26,120 --> 04:32:27,080
I told you, it suddenly mutated.

5703
04:32:27,160 --> 04:32:28,120
I can't tell if it's...

5704
04:32:28,120 --> 04:32:28,260
Yeah, right.

5705
04:32:28,920 --> 04:32:32,620
Snake, it's people like you that take all the fun out of watching movies.

5706
04:32:33,000 --> 04:32:35,720
Always nitpicking and taking things too seriously.

5707
04:32:36,100 --> 04:32:37,560
Honestly, why even bother?

5708
04:32:38,460 --> 04:32:41,320
Look, the important thing isn't that it got big.

5709
04:32:41,660 --> 04:32:42,900
Then what is important?

5710
04:32:43,460 --> 04:32:46,140
The fact that there's a huge spider destroying everything.

5711
04:32:46,160 --> 04:32:47,780
I think it's pretty important that it got big.

5712
04:32:51,940 --> 04:32:52,320
Okay.

5713
04:33:03,210 --> 04:33:04,550
You think that end is still there?

5714
04:33:07,430 --> 04:33:09,170
You think he's still chillin' out there?

5715
04:33:18,950 --> 04:33:20,090
You think he's still there?

5716
04:33:22,070 --> 04:33:23,330
You think he's chillin'?

5717
04:33:23,730 --> 04:33:24,790
You think he's still asleep?

5718
04:33:24,930 --> 04:33:26,130
You think people forgot about him?

5719
04:33:26,130 --> 04:33:27,370
They just didn't bring him back inside?

5720
04:33:35,000 --> 04:33:36,120
He's out of there?

5721
04:33:37,280 --> 04:33:39,180
Oh my god!

5722
04:33:42,100 --> 04:33:43,540
How will it work?

5723
04:33:44,560 --> 04:33:45,460
In the water?

5724
04:33:48,720 --> 04:33:50,200
Wait, how does this work actually?

5725
04:33:51,520 --> 04:33:52,480
Oh, L1.

5726
04:33:55,520 --> 04:33:57,080
There's three guys.

5727
04:34:03,820 --> 04:34:05,380
I could blow that up.

5728
04:34:05,380 --> 04:34:06,260
And blow them up.

5729
04:34:08,020 --> 04:34:09,180
What if I blew them up?

5730
04:34:10,020 --> 04:34:11,940
What if I just blow them all up?

5731
04:34:15,140 --> 04:34:15,660
Hmm...

5732
04:34:18,320 --> 04:34:18,840
.

5733
04:34:18,840 --> 04:34:20,120
Come in, HQ.

5734
04:34:20,480 --> 04:34:22,560
This is HQ.

5735
04:34:23,420 --> 04:34:23,940
Signs

5736
04:34:27,520 --> 04:34:28,500
of enemy infiltration.

5737
04:34:28,660 --> 04:34:29,840
Commence alert formation.

5738
04:34:31,980 --> 04:34:33,800
Acknowledge all sending reinforcements.

5739
04:34:33,840 --> 04:34:34,660
Aw, damn.

5740
04:34:35,780 --> 04:34:36,300
.

5741
04:34:40,500 --> 04:34:41,260
What's wrong?

5742
04:34:42,660 --> 04:34:42,760
Hmm?

5743
04:34:43,460 --> 04:34:44,180
What's wrong?

5744
04:34:44,740 --> 04:34:44,760
.

5745
04:34:47,200 --> 04:34:48,560
Nah, I'm just a crocodile.

5746
04:34:49,420 --> 04:34:49,440
.

5747
04:34:51,540 --> 04:34:52,880
Guys, I'm just a crocodile.

5748
04:34:53,380 --> 04:34:53,860
.

5749
04:34:54,380 --> 04:34:55,640
I'm just a croc.

5750
04:34:55,660 --> 04:34:55,920
.

5751
04:34:56,500 --> 04:34:57,460
I'm just a crocodile.

5752
04:34:58,120 --> 04:34:58,400
.

5753
04:34:58,960 --> 04:35:00,020
I'm just a croc.

5754
04:35:00,020 --> 04:35:01,500
Oh, they're gonna replace these guys.

5755
04:35:02,120 --> 04:35:03,480
They're kinda silly, aren't they?

5756
04:35:03,700 --> 04:35:04,180
.

5757
04:35:05,280 --> 04:35:05,760
Unless...

5758
04:35:05,760 --> 04:35:06,020
.

5759
04:35:06,020 --> 04:35:07,000
I take them out.

5760
04:35:07,720 --> 04:35:08,200
.

5761
04:35:11,920 --> 04:35:12,400
Oops.

5762
04:35:12,520 --> 04:35:12,780
.

5763
04:35:12,780 --> 04:35:14,080
How did that not hit?

5764
04:35:14,360 --> 04:35:14,480
.

5765
04:35:16,340 --> 04:35:17,540
I'm just a crocodile.

5766
04:35:18,160 --> 04:35:19,480
You can't swim, can you?

5767
04:35:22,590 --> 04:35:22,650
.

5768
04:35:22,650 --> 04:35:23,570
What's wrong?

5769
04:35:23,710 --> 04:35:24,170
.

5770
04:35:24,170 --> 04:35:24,770
What's wrong?

5771
04:35:25,090 --> 04:35:25,410
.

5772
04:35:26,330 --> 04:35:27,390
Croc with a sniper.

5773
04:35:27,870 --> 04:35:28,390
.

5774
04:35:36,470 --> 04:35:37,430
Get his leg.

5775
04:35:37,590 --> 04:35:38,070
.

5776
04:35:38,070 --> 04:35:38,150
.

5777
04:35:38,150 --> 04:35:38,490
.

5778
04:35:39,590 --> 04:35:41,050
How can you hold this up still?

5779
04:35:41,230 --> 04:35:41,510
.

5780
04:35:41,510 --> 04:35:42,410
You're so brave.

5781
04:35:43,190 --> 04:35:43,710
.

5782
04:35:44,910 --> 04:35:45,430
.

5783
04:35:45,650 --> 04:35:45,970
.

5784
04:35:47,410 --> 04:35:47,930
.

5785
04:35:47,930 --> 04:35:48,950
I'm just a crocodile.

5786
04:35:49,330 --> 04:35:49,650
.

5787
04:35:49,650 --> 04:35:50,710
Just a crocodile.

5788
04:35:51,350 --> 04:35:51,790
.

5789
04:35:51,790 --> 04:35:52,190
I'm a lark.

5790
04:35:55,520 --> 04:35:56,980
They're gonna send new people in.

5791
04:35:57,360 --> 04:35:57,460
.

5792
04:35:57,460 --> 04:35:59,040
Might as well play with my food.

5793
04:35:59,140 --> 04:35:59,300
.

5794
04:35:59,300 --> 04:36:00,720
Look at this poor guy.

5795
04:36:01,640 --> 04:36:02,080
.

5796
04:36:04,240 --> 04:36:04,680
.

5797
04:36:04,680 --> 04:36:04,720
.

5798
04:36:04,720 --> 04:36:04,920
.

5799
04:36:04,920 --> 04:36:04,960
.

5800
04:36:04,960 --> 04:36:04,980
.

5801
04:36:04,980 --> 04:36:05,020
.

5802
04:36:05,660 --> 04:36:06,100
.

5803
04:36:06,100 --> 04:36:06,140
.

5804
04:36:06,140 --> 04:36:06,220
.

5805
04:36:17,380 --> 04:36:18,020
.

5806
04:36:18,020 --> 04:36:18,760
.

5807
04:36:18,760 --> 04:36:18,980
.

5808
04:36:24,580 --> 04:36:25,620
Problem solved.

5809
04:36:26,500 --> 04:36:27,020
.

5810
04:36:28,220 --> 04:36:28,740
Maybe.

5811
04:36:30,080 --> 04:36:30,600
.

5812
04:36:33,480 --> 04:36:34,000
Okay.

5813
04:36:34,240 --> 04:36:34,460
.

5814
04:36:34,460 --> 04:36:36,800
I'll do my best not to kill anyone else.

5815
04:36:37,240 --> 04:36:37,700
.

5816
04:36:39,180 --> 04:36:40,320
It was because...

5817
04:36:40,320 --> 04:36:40,460
.

5818
04:36:41,620 --> 04:36:43,300
It was because...

5819
04:36:43,300 --> 04:36:43,980
.

5820
04:36:43,980 --> 04:36:44,580
You know...

5821
04:36:44,580 --> 04:36:44,780
.

5822
04:36:44,780 --> 04:36:45,320
They just...

5823
04:36:46,140 --> 04:36:46,660
.

5824
04:36:53,140 --> 04:36:53,660
.

5825
04:36:53,660 --> 04:36:54,100
Wiggle, wiggle.

5826
04:36:54,460 --> 04:36:55,260
Wiggle, wiggle.

5827
04:36:55,800 --> 04:36:56,560
Wiggle, wiggle.

5828
04:36:56,980 --> 04:36:57,740
Wiggle, wiggle.

5829
04:36:57,900 --> 04:36:58,040
.

5830
04:36:58,040 --> 04:36:58,120
.

5831
04:36:58,140 --> 04:36:58,940
Wiggle, wiggle.

5832
04:37:00,480 --> 04:37:01,580
Crocodiles are violent.

5833
04:37:01,860 --> 04:37:04,620
Have you never seen the crocodile death roll?

5834
04:37:04,960 --> 04:37:06,420
It's kind of insane, actually.

5835
04:37:19,880 --> 04:37:22,520
This is so terrible looking.

5836
04:37:22,800 --> 04:37:23,300
Jerry!

5837
04:37:23,740 --> 04:37:25,300
Thanks for the 20 gifts and thank you!

5838
04:37:25,900 --> 04:37:27,580
It's because I was so nervous.

5839
04:37:27,760 --> 04:37:30,960
I really would have drank them, but I was...

5840
04:37:31,340 --> 04:37:35,100
nervous about my... suppressor.

5841
04:37:35,120 --> 04:37:36,280
I didn't want to waste it.

5842
04:37:36,400 --> 04:37:38,520
Especially if I could just kill these guys as a crocodile.

5843
04:37:39,420 --> 04:37:40,860
You should give the croc a name.

5844
04:37:44,860 --> 04:37:46,320
What should his name be?

5845
04:37:47,320 --> 04:37:47,800
Malcolm?

5846
04:37:49,060 --> 04:37:51,140
Malcolm the bloodthirsty crocodile?

5847
04:37:53,440 --> 04:37:57,180
I just realized the wall where... where... oh my gosh.

5848
04:37:57,300 --> 04:37:57,740
Please.

5849
04:37:58,420 --> 04:38:00,420
Where Vulcan smashed it.

5850
04:38:00,480 --> 04:38:01,240
It's all smashed up.

5851
04:38:01,340 --> 04:38:01,860
That's so cool.

5852
04:38:02,320 --> 04:38:04,340
Is there anything in the water?

5853
04:38:05,180 --> 04:38:06,560
Like any suppressors?

5854
04:38:12,140 --> 04:38:13,920
Any suppressors in the water?

5855
04:38:16,700 --> 04:38:17,540
Mintai, hi!

5856
04:38:19,560 --> 04:38:20,440
I'll take that.

5857
04:38:20,800 --> 04:38:21,520
Yeah, baby.

5858
04:38:23,460 --> 04:38:24,720
Careful with the croc hat.

5859
04:38:24,800 --> 04:38:28,340
I hear it subsistence add an extra boss if you wear it for the majority of the game.

5860
04:38:28,860 --> 04:38:30,020
Crocodile Dundee!

5861
04:38:32,060 --> 04:38:33,320
Kind of worth, actually.

5862
04:38:35,100 --> 04:38:37,760
I would wear it the whole game if I could see Crocodile Dundee.

5863
04:38:38,380 --> 04:38:39,000
Wait a second.

5864
04:38:39,860 --> 04:38:40,640
What's over here?

5865
04:38:43,120 --> 04:38:44,480
This is not where I came from.

5866
04:38:47,060 --> 04:38:47,560
Is it?

5867
04:38:49,040 --> 04:38:50,080
Maybe it is where I... no.

5868
04:38:51,220 --> 04:38:54,260
Oh, that is where I came from.

5869
04:38:54,300 --> 04:38:54,820
Just kidding.

5870
04:38:56,600 --> 04:38:56,980
Oh.

5871
04:39:05,300 --> 04:39:07,340
Okay, let's continue onwards.

5872
04:39:11,220 --> 04:39:12,980
How do I... can I grab here?

5873
04:39:13,780 --> 04:39:14,900
Can I lift up?

5874
04:39:15,020 --> 04:39:15,740
Yeah, please.

5875
04:39:17,960 --> 04:39:18,480
Okay.

5876
04:39:18,720 --> 04:39:20,800
Wait, I wanted to grab his body.

5877
04:39:26,560 --> 04:39:28,360
I already grabbed his body.

5878
04:39:40,840 --> 04:39:41,960
It's inside the warehouse.

5879
04:39:43,040 --> 04:39:44,260
Thank you, wuss.

5880
04:39:47,640 --> 04:39:49,840
I don't think I can have my croc hat anymore.

5881
04:39:51,200 --> 04:39:53,400
I don't think I can have my croc hat anymore.

5882
04:39:53,880 --> 04:39:54,440
So sad.

5883
04:39:54,640 --> 04:39:55,080
So sad.

5884
04:39:55,120 --> 04:39:55,340
So sad.

5885
04:39:59,160 --> 04:40:00,300
We'll do splitter.

5886
04:40:00,560 --> 04:40:02,460
I haven't done that one, I think, this whole time.

5887
04:40:03,320 --> 04:40:04,560
And we'll go...

5888
04:40:07,640 --> 04:40:08,520
We'll go naked.

5889
04:40:09,680 --> 04:40:10,080
Animals.

5890
04:40:13,320 --> 04:40:13,720
Wowee.

5891
04:40:14,020 --> 04:40:15,040
Where is my pizza?

5892
04:40:20,040 --> 04:40:20,740
Hold on.

5893
04:40:22,980 --> 04:40:24,740
I'm checking on my pizza.

5894
04:40:25,660 --> 04:40:26,840
Where's my pizza?

5895
04:40:27,580 --> 04:40:29,780
They said it was not gonna take this long.

5896
04:40:31,320 --> 04:40:32,700
Driver ate the pizza.

5897
04:40:32,800 --> 04:40:35,920
If he did, I will seriously cry.

5898
04:40:36,300 --> 04:40:36,780
Okay.

5899
04:40:36,920 --> 04:40:37,960
It should be soon.

5900
04:40:38,080 --> 04:40:39,340
Maybe in like the next five minutes.

5901
04:40:39,940 --> 04:40:40,460
Hopefully.

5902
04:40:42,380 --> 04:40:43,640
Maybe it's bad traffic.

5903
04:40:46,850 --> 04:40:48,470
The crocodile got it.

5904
04:40:49,150 --> 04:40:49,670
Ahem.

5905
04:40:55,370 --> 04:40:56,790
Pizza guy is watching the stream?

5906
04:40:57,090 --> 04:40:57,510
I sure hope.

5907
04:40:58,970 --> 04:41:00,450
This is where I first threw up.

5908
04:41:02,890 --> 04:41:03,730
Let's do it again.

5909
04:41:05,470 --> 04:41:05,950
Spin.

5910
04:41:06,990 --> 04:41:07,470
Spin.

5911
04:41:07,890 --> 04:41:08,190
Spin.

5912
04:41:08,390 --> 04:41:08,870
Spin.

5913
04:41:09,950 --> 04:41:10,430
Spin.

5914
04:41:10,510 --> 04:41:10,750
Spin.

5915
04:41:11,210 --> 04:41:11,370
Spin.

5916
04:41:11,470 --> 04:41:11,950
Spin.

5917
04:41:12,530 --> 04:41:12,750
Spin.

5918
04:41:12,830 --> 04:41:13,310
Spin.

5919
04:41:13,310 --> 04:41:13,710
Spin.

5920
04:41:13,710 --> 04:41:13,870
Spin.

5921
04:41:13,950 --> 04:41:14,430
Spin.

5922
04:41:14,430 --> 04:41:14,750
Spin.

5923
04:41:15,830 --> 04:41:16,310
Spin.

5924
04:41:22,900 --> 04:41:23,380
Spin.

5925
04:41:23,380 --> 04:41:23,580
That's nasty.

5926
04:41:25,300 --> 04:41:25,760
Dang.

5927
04:41:25,760 --> 04:41:26,420
That's gross.

5928
04:41:34,840 --> 04:41:37,180
Maybe black was not the best camel.

5929
04:41:41,020 --> 04:41:41,480
Maybe...

5930
04:41:42,980 --> 04:41:43,800
Tiger stripe.

5931
04:41:46,500 --> 04:41:48,260
You're about to be death rolled by a crocodile.

5932
04:41:48,400 --> 04:41:50,800
Just use the strength that you get from your...

5933
04:41:51,300 --> 04:41:51,760
Stop.

5934
04:41:51,760 --> 04:41:51,940
Stop.

5935
04:41:57,040 --> 04:41:57,720
Someone's hungry.

5936
04:41:58,280 --> 04:41:59,020
And it's me.

5937
04:41:59,160 --> 04:42:00,580
That actually wasn't his stomach.

5938
04:42:00,700 --> 04:42:01,200
That was mine.

5939
04:42:02,780 --> 04:42:05,420
Well, I should have grabbed some more fish while I was in the water, huh?

5940
04:42:07,400 --> 04:42:09,080
I guess I could go back if I needed to.

5941
04:42:16,790 --> 04:42:17,350
Let's see.

5942
04:42:42,200 --> 04:42:43,000
Little baby.

5943
04:42:45,640 --> 04:42:47,200
Where else are your friends?

5944
04:42:47,900 --> 04:42:50,180
I can't remember where these guys are at.

5945
04:42:53,280 --> 04:42:54,960
I see them over there.

5946
04:43:09,080 --> 04:43:09,940
Anybody else?

5947
04:43:13,670 --> 04:43:14,950
Just some rats?

5948
04:43:17,670 --> 04:43:18,630
What was that noise?

5949
04:43:22,320 --> 04:43:23,660
Just some rats maybe?

5950
04:43:24,700 --> 04:43:25,880
Anybody else up?

5951
04:43:26,020 --> 04:43:26,780
Oh, there he is.

5952
04:43:27,940 --> 04:43:29,960
Why doesn't it show me that on the radar?

5953
04:43:30,580 --> 04:43:31,460
So rude.

5954
04:43:37,860 --> 04:43:38,980
Where can I get him from?

5955
04:43:41,460 --> 04:43:42,460
Might be tight.

5956
04:43:49,250 --> 04:43:50,330
Get up there!

5957
04:43:51,910 --> 04:43:54,050
Where did he go?

5958
04:43:58,550 --> 04:43:59,290
There he is.

5959
04:43:59,610 --> 04:44:00,550
I see him.

5960
04:44:00,630 --> 04:44:01,930
He's moving across there.

5961
04:44:02,890 --> 04:44:03,990
I see him.

5962
04:44:04,650 --> 04:44:05,350
Right there.

5963
04:44:13,460 --> 04:44:13,560
Yippee!

5964
04:44:14,200 --> 04:44:14,980
Is that all of them?

5965
04:44:21,350 --> 04:44:22,350
I'll take that.

5966
04:44:26,180 --> 04:44:27,200
Desert face.

5967
04:44:30,680 --> 04:44:31,660
Think there's more?

5968
04:44:33,820 --> 04:44:34,540
Is there?

5969
04:44:35,700 --> 04:44:36,260
Clean.

5970
04:44:36,600 --> 04:44:37,380
Oh, crab!

5971
04:44:38,820 --> 04:44:41,200
I guess I won't be so willy-nilly then.

5972
04:44:41,300 --> 04:44:42,240
I'll be a little more sneaky.

5973
04:44:42,440 --> 04:44:43,220
A little more strategic.

5974
04:44:43,420 --> 04:44:43,860
Perhaps.

5975
04:44:49,090 --> 04:44:50,370
Grab your body.

5976
04:44:50,650 --> 04:44:53,150
And take what you have.

5977
04:44:54,250 --> 04:44:54,690
Nice.

5978
04:44:55,870 --> 04:44:57,370
Rob you for all that you're worth.

5979
04:44:57,430 --> 04:44:59,130
If there's any other guys, maybe I can seek you soon.

5980
04:45:10,130 --> 04:45:11,570
I thought I heard footsteps.

5981
04:45:12,770 --> 04:45:13,750
But maybe not.

5982
04:45:17,660 --> 04:45:18,560
I think we're okay.

5983
04:45:21,880 --> 04:45:22,320
Disinfect.

5984
04:45:23,560 --> 04:45:24,740
Can I go in here?

5985
04:45:26,700 --> 04:45:27,440
I can.

5986
04:45:29,660 --> 04:45:30,540
Oh yeah!

5987
04:45:31,060 --> 04:45:32,600
We got some ramen noodles!

5988
04:45:32,600 --> 04:45:32,800
Wait.

5989
04:45:32,920 --> 04:45:33,720
I can blow this up.

5990
04:45:34,700 --> 04:45:35,900
I can blow this place up.

5991
04:45:39,360 --> 04:45:40,240
Box on the box?

5992
04:45:40,340 --> 04:45:40,960
Oh, thank you!

5993
04:45:53,050 --> 04:45:55,410
Did I put the TNT in there or am I crazy?

5994
04:45:56,910 --> 04:45:58,070
Use your hands!

5995
04:45:59,570 --> 04:46:00,930
Use your arms, Snake!

5996
04:46:01,070 --> 04:46:02,450
Just use your arms!

5997
04:46:02,690 --> 04:46:04,790
I know they're like a little T-Rex, but please.

5998
04:46:07,150 --> 04:46:08,570
Oh, I have to hang and get it.

5999
04:46:09,270 --> 04:46:09,670
Shoot.

6000
04:46:12,030 --> 04:46:13,350
Thanks for the Zip-A-Tot!

6001
04:46:14,250 --> 04:46:15,870
Never learned how to crouch walk.

6002
04:46:16,690 --> 04:46:18,550
Yeah, that's definitely why.

6003
04:46:19,530 --> 04:46:20,290
For real.

6004
04:46:26,500 --> 04:46:27,080
Yippee!

6005
04:46:28,060 --> 04:46:29,120
Wait a second.

6006
04:46:37,690 --> 04:46:38,890
He only had two.

6007
04:46:39,890 --> 04:46:41,170
I don't want him waking up.

6008
04:46:45,960 --> 04:46:47,940
This suppressor respawns?

6009
04:46:47,940 --> 04:46:48,820
No way.

6010
04:46:49,180 --> 04:46:51,220
Okay, let's put down a TNT here.

6011
04:46:51,420 --> 04:46:52,740
And again, once I...

6012
04:46:52,740 --> 04:46:54,560
Before I leave, we'll blow it up.

6013
04:46:57,400 --> 04:46:58,280
Burn the food.

6014
04:47:00,160 --> 04:47:01,060
All right.

6015
04:47:01,740 --> 04:47:02,760
Very good, everybody.

6016
04:47:11,110 --> 04:47:12,590
Okay, I don't see anybody there.

6017
04:47:15,990 --> 04:47:16,510
Gimme!

6018
04:47:17,370 --> 04:47:17,890
Gimme!

6019
04:47:19,310 --> 04:47:19,830
Gimme!

6020
04:47:22,190 --> 04:47:22,710
Nice.

6021
04:47:24,130 --> 04:47:26,450
Is there anything else that I missed down here?

6022
04:47:26,570 --> 04:47:27,410
I don't think so.

6023
04:47:29,090 --> 04:47:31,190
I think it was just the suppressor that I got.

6024
04:47:32,190 --> 04:47:32,630
Right?

6025
04:47:33,910 --> 04:47:34,350
I...

6026
04:47:36,250 --> 04:47:36,910
think so.

6027
04:47:37,510 --> 04:47:37,610
Hmm.

6028
04:47:38,430 --> 04:47:39,110
You're in the clear.

6029
04:47:39,150 --> 04:47:39,810
Sorry for the false alarm.

6030
04:47:39,930 --> 04:47:40,150
No!

6031
04:47:40,690 --> 04:47:41,650
You're all good.

6032
04:47:42,290 --> 04:47:43,330
No worries at all.

6033
04:47:49,240 --> 04:47:50,260
What was it?

6034
04:47:50,880 --> 04:47:51,320
Circle.

6035
04:47:55,080 --> 04:47:56,760
And they'll never eat again.

6036
04:47:58,060 --> 04:47:58,500
Okay.

6037
04:48:01,500 --> 04:48:02,020
Okay, I'm gonna try this again.

6038
04:48:02,020 --> 04:48:02,400
Yibby!

6039
04:48:06,600 --> 04:48:07,640
My pizza!

6040
04:48:09,820 --> 04:48:10,660
My pizza!

6041
04:48:11,080 --> 04:48:12,120
I'll be right back.

6042
04:48:12,380 --> 04:48:13,180
Pizza time!

6043
04:48:13,280 --> 04:48:13,860
Pizza time!

6044
04:48:14,680 --> 04:48:15,720
Pizza time.

6045
04:48:15,880 --> 04:48:16,820
Pizza time.

6046
04:48:16,860 --> 04:48:17,860
Pizza time.

6047
04:48:17,860 --> 04:48:17,940
Pizza time.

6048
04:48:18,700 --> 04:48:19,220
Pizza time.

6049
04:48:19,220 --> 04:48:19,520
BRB.

6050
04:48:20,080 --> 04:48:20,600
Sorry.

6051
04:48:20,760 --> 04:48:22,840
I know I've been, like, leaving so much this stream.

6052
04:48:24,000 --> 04:48:24,720
BRB, though.

6053
04:48:26,060 --> 04:48:27,260
Actually, I'm gonna change it.

6054
04:48:27,300 --> 04:48:27,820
Pizza time.

6055
04:48:30,040 --> 04:48:30,880
Pizza time!

6056
04:50:05,070 --> 04:50:06,030
Finally, pizza.

6057
04:50:07,430 --> 04:50:09,810
I wonder if it was outside my door for a while.

6058
04:50:11,010 --> 04:50:13,430
It's kind of cold, but it did take a while.

6059
04:50:15,790 --> 04:50:16,750
Yay, pizza!

6060
04:50:18,430 --> 04:50:19,930
A little break time.

6061
04:50:21,010 --> 04:50:22,010
Break time for pizza.

6062
04:50:22,110 --> 04:50:22,670
How are you guys doing?

6063
04:50:22,710 --> 04:50:23,290
How was your weekend?

6064
04:50:23,570 --> 04:50:24,690
Did you guys do anything fun?

6065
04:50:25,330 --> 04:50:26,630
Did you guys do anything?

6066
04:50:27,270 --> 04:50:28,950
I know some people are at TwitchCon.

6067
04:50:35,510 --> 04:50:36,190
I went

6068
04:50:43,890 --> 04:50:47,430
golfing.

6069
04:50:47,430 --> 04:50:47,890
Wow.

6070
04:50:48,890 --> 04:50:50,170
I got a golfer.

6071
04:50:51,350 --> 04:50:52,090
How's the pizza?

6072
04:50:52,130 --> 04:50:52,850
It's so good.

6073
04:50:57,150 --> 04:51:01,930
You went to the haunted house?

6074
04:51:05,600 --> 04:51:07,000
A haunted house?

6075
04:51:07,240 --> 04:51:08,660
Like my place?

6076
04:51:09,540 --> 04:51:15,880
What are the toppings?

6077
04:51:16,620 --> 04:51:21,620
It's pineapple and green pepper.

6078
04:51:21,720 --> 04:51:23,360
Exactly what I like.

6079
04:51:23,920 --> 04:51:25,180
Exactly what I like.

6080
04:51:28,960 --> 04:51:30,280
I cut down a tree.

6081
04:51:30,900 --> 04:51:31,740
Oh my god.

6082
04:51:41,450 --> 04:51:45,950
Gosh, I've been like, just thinking about this pizza for the past 30 minutes.

6083
04:51:46,230 --> 04:51:47,330
Just wanting this pizza.

6084
04:52:05,780 --> 04:52:08,240
But I don't want to spend so much time eating.

6085
04:52:09,180 --> 04:52:10,360
So I took a couple bites.

6086
04:52:11,120 --> 04:52:12,440
And we continue onward.

6087
04:52:13,380 --> 04:52:13,860
...

6088
04:52:15,380 --> 04:52:15,860
...

6089
04:52:17,260 --> 04:52:17,740
...

6090
04:52:17,740 --> 04:52:18,140
...

6091
04:52:20,440 --> 04:52:20,920
...

6092
04:52:20,920 --> 04:52:21,480
...

6093
04:52:21,480 --> 04:52:21,520
...

6094
04:52:25,540 --> 04:52:26,500
Pizza Gamer.

6095
04:52:35,220 --> 04:52:37,400
We don't fight him just yet.

6096
04:52:37,440 --> 04:52:37,800
The fear.

6097
04:52:39,620 --> 04:52:43,740
I know you want me to shut up about the thermal goggles, but they might help you see things in this area.

6098
04:52:44,080 --> 04:52:44,520
...

6099
04:52:47,280 --> 04:52:48,200
Like that guy?

6100
04:52:50,660 --> 04:52:51,100
...

6101
04:52:51,100 --> 04:52:51,480
Or that?

6102
04:52:51,780 --> 04:52:52,480
What is that?

6103
04:52:52,980 --> 04:52:53,820
Is that a guy?

6104
04:52:54,080 --> 04:52:54,860
What is that?

6105
04:52:55,740 --> 04:52:57,020
What is that against a wall?

6106
04:52:57,620 --> 04:52:58,520
What is that thing?

6107
04:52:59,120 --> 04:52:59,500
...

6108
04:53:01,260 --> 04:53:02,020
What is that?

6109
04:53:03,740 --> 04:53:04,580
The goggles!

6110
04:53:06,280 --> 04:53:07,480
It doesn't even show up.

6111
04:53:09,220 --> 04:53:09,980
There's snakes.

6112
04:53:10,220 --> 04:53:11,500
There's lots of things in the trees.

6113
04:53:12,580 --> 04:53:13,020
...

6114
04:53:14,880 --> 04:53:15,580
There's pixels?

6115
04:53:16,620 --> 04:53:17,660
Oh, I think it's a rock.

6116
04:53:18,200 --> 04:53:18,280
...

6117
04:53:18,280 --> 04:53:18,980
...

6118
04:53:21,320 --> 04:53:22,900
I think actually it's a rock.

6119
04:53:23,520 --> 04:53:23,920
...

6120
04:53:29,700 --> 04:53:32,280
This is a place that I wish I could crouch walk, you know?

6121
04:53:33,000 --> 04:53:33,400
...

6122
04:53:38,250 --> 04:53:39,010
What's up there?

6123
04:53:39,930 --> 04:53:40,890
That's a trap!

6124
04:53:41,470 --> 04:53:43,490
That up there is a trap for sure.

6125
04:53:43,690 --> 04:53:44,290
Oh, don't eat that.

6126
04:53:44,450 --> 04:53:45,330
Don't eat that frog.

6127
04:53:46,050 --> 04:53:46,450
...

6128
04:53:47,850 --> 04:53:48,610
I remember.

6129
04:53:50,510 --> 04:53:50,910
...

6130
04:53:52,770 --> 04:53:53,650
Don't eat that frog.

6131
04:53:53,650 --> 04:53:54,970
Wait, can't I get this?

6132
04:53:55,330 --> 04:53:56,810
For like him to eat?

6133
04:53:56,950 --> 04:53:57,690
Won't he eat it?

6134
04:53:57,950 --> 04:53:58,910
Or am I crazy?

6135
04:54:00,390 --> 04:54:01,810
Won't the fear eat frogs?

6136
04:54:02,930 --> 04:54:02,950
...

6137
04:54:02,950 --> 04:54:03,950
Oh, my bad.

6138
04:54:07,050 --> 04:54:08,170
I see that string!

6139
04:54:17,210 --> 04:54:17,690
Blabocos!

6140
04:54:18,810 --> 04:54:19,970
We gotta get them!

6141
04:54:25,070 --> 04:54:26,650
Well, didn't they taste bad though?

6142
04:54:27,110 --> 04:54:27,590
...

6143
04:54:28,910 --> 04:54:30,010
Maybe I shouldn't get them.

6144
04:54:30,110 --> 04:54:31,110
Maybe I shouldn't torture snake.

6145
04:54:35,140 --> 04:54:35,540
...

6146
04:54:36,080 --> 04:54:36,480
Mococos!

6147
04:54:36,680 --> 04:54:37,080
No!

6148
04:54:37,620 --> 04:54:38,020
...

6149
04:54:40,640 --> 04:54:41,400
What is that?

6150
04:54:42,100 --> 04:54:42,500
It's

6151
04:54:49,530 --> 04:54:50,350
a bush.

6152
04:54:51,030 --> 04:54:51,290
...

6153
04:54:54,170 --> 04:54:54,570
Hmm...

6154
04:54:55,270 --> 04:54:56,130
I know I need to...

6155
04:54:56,130 --> 04:54:57,270
I'm running out of food though.

6156
04:54:58,230 --> 04:54:58,630
...

6157
04:55:00,450 --> 04:55:02,070
Should probably get this guy, right?

6158
04:55:02,790 --> 04:55:03,190
...

6159
04:55:03,190 --> 04:55:04,430
A little snack.

6160
04:55:05,290 --> 04:55:05,770
...

6161
04:55:05,770 --> 04:55:06,490
Sorry, guy.

6162
04:55:06,790 --> 04:55:07,610
You're our snack.

6163
04:55:08,710 --> 04:55:09,190
...

6164
04:55:09,190 --> 04:55:09,990
...

6165
04:55:12,070 --> 04:55:12,970
You're our snack.

6166
04:55:13,710 --> 04:55:13,850
...

6167
04:55:17,030 --> 04:55:17,710
Where'd he go?

6168
04:55:17,810 --> 04:55:18,270
Okay, there.

6169
04:55:18,510 --> 04:55:18,990
...

6170
04:55:20,460 --> 04:55:23,260
Is there any way to disable some of these traps?

6171
04:55:23,500 --> 04:55:23,900
...

6172
04:55:26,820 --> 04:55:28,400
Like, what does this one over here do?

6173
04:55:29,100 --> 04:55:29,580
...

6174
04:55:33,590 --> 04:55:36,330
Can an animal set it off even?

6175
04:55:36,710 --> 04:55:37,190
...

6176
04:55:39,030 --> 04:55:39,470
Snack!

6177
04:55:39,490 --> 04:55:39,690
...

6178
04:55:42,010 --> 04:55:42,710
That's a meal.

6179
04:55:48,300 --> 04:55:49,200
You got the snake.

6180
04:55:50,280 --> 04:55:51,680
Don't let it, don't let it...

6181
04:55:51,680 --> 04:55:53,400
It's more afraid of you than you are of it.

6182
04:55:54,020 --> 04:55:54,460
...

6183
04:55:54,940 --> 04:55:55,380
Like,

6184
04:56:00,100 --> 04:56:00,920
what does this one do?

6185
04:56:02,580 --> 04:56:03,020
...

6186
04:56:03,020 --> 04:56:03,240
...

6187
04:56:09,440 --> 04:56:09,880
Sokolov!

6188
04:56:10,660 --> 04:56:11,100
...

6189
04:56:13,960 --> 04:56:14,760
Just kidding.

6190
04:56:15,160 --> 04:56:15,420
...

6191
04:56:17,180 --> 04:56:17,740
...

6192
04:56:21,700 --> 04:56:22,460
I'm out.

6193
04:56:22,560 --> 04:56:23,320
I'm full of food.

6194
04:56:24,020 --> 04:56:24,540
...

6195
04:56:27,300 --> 04:56:28,560
See any ghosts?

6196
04:56:29,040 --> 04:56:29,600
...

6197
04:56:29,600 --> 04:56:29,620
...

6198
04:56:38,200 --> 04:56:39,540
Oh, I forgot the out!

6199
04:56:39,720 --> 04:56:40,040
...

6200
04:56:40,040 --> 04:56:41,860
Oh, I forgot the...

6201
04:56:41,860 --> 04:56:51,560
Oh, I forgot the...

6202
04:56:59,680 --> 04:57:01,920
While we do Codex, I can eat.

6203
04:57:03,240 --> 04:57:04,540
We'll do Codex and I'll eat.

6204
04:57:21,760 --> 04:57:23,900
Speaking of which... Yeah?

6205
04:57:24,420 --> 04:57:25,580
Are you going to eat that?

6206
04:57:25,980 --> 04:57:27,780
I was planning on it, yeah.

6207
04:57:28,520 --> 04:57:29,320
Well, alright.

6208
04:57:29,900 --> 04:57:31,720
Is there some reason I shouldn't?

6209
04:57:32,200 --> 04:57:33,820
No, that's not what I meant.

6210
04:57:34,100 --> 04:57:35,320
Then what did you mean?

6211
04:57:35,880 --> 04:57:40,220
I was just going to say that if you weren't going to eat it, you should bring it back to me.

6212
04:57:40,640 --> 04:57:42,020
I've always wanted to try some.

6213
04:57:42,640 --> 04:57:43,080
Whatever.

6214
04:57:48,090 --> 04:57:50,330
I see you've caught a European rabbit.

6215
04:57:50,850 --> 04:57:57,390
A European rabbit is said to have come from the Mediterranean region originally, but nowadays they're found all over the world.

6216
04:57:57,970 --> 04:58:02,570
They've been used since ancient times as a source of food, so it might be worth catching them.

6217
04:58:03,610 --> 04:58:05,510
Rabbits are known to eat their own excrement.

6218
04:58:05,930 --> 04:58:07,330
They eat their own?

6219
04:58:07,550 --> 04:58:08,250
That's right.

6220
04:58:08,470 --> 04:58:09,970
It's called cecal feces.

6221
04:58:10,210 --> 04:58:17,190
When the rabbit eats fiber, the fiber is fermented in the rabbit's appendix, or cecum, and turned into a nutritious substance full of vitamins.

6222
04:58:17,870 --> 04:58:20,310
The rabbit excretes the substance and then eats it.

6223
04:58:20,330 --> 04:58:21,770
And eats it again to absorb the nutrients.

6224
04:58:22,370 --> 04:58:23,370
That's a neat trick.

6225
04:58:23,670 --> 04:58:24,870
I think I'll give it a try.

6226
04:58:25,290 --> 04:58:27,950
Snake, rabbits and humans don't work the...

6227
04:58:27,950 --> 04:58:28,830
I'm just kidding.

6228
04:58:29,290 --> 04:58:31,290
You really thought I was going to eat it?

6229
04:58:31,490 --> 04:58:32,870
A little, yeah.

6230
04:58:33,570 --> 04:58:35,110
Even I wouldn't do that.

6231
04:58:35,590 --> 04:58:36,530
I guess not.

6232
04:58:36,910 --> 04:58:38,930
But how did those cecal feces taste?

6233
04:58:39,330 --> 04:58:39,650
What?

6234
04:58:40,410 --> 04:58:41,570
I'm just kidding.

6235
04:58:42,690 --> 04:58:43,170
Oh...

6236
04:58:46,780 --> 04:58:50,760
Sorry, I was muted so I could chew without fear of being heard.

6237
04:58:50,760 --> 04:58:51,160
What?

6238
04:58:51,260 --> 04:58:52,600
This guy just...

6239
04:58:54,560 --> 04:58:55,760
This guy...

6240
04:58:55,760 --> 04:58:57,080
You was not kidding.

6241
04:59:01,820 --> 04:59:02,560
Poop eater.

6242
04:59:05,000 --> 04:59:07,300
What does it... what's the trap though?

6243
04:59:07,820 --> 04:59:09,620
If I hit these trees...

6244
04:59:11,040 --> 04:59:12,640
Will I get the mococos?

6245
04:59:15,220 --> 04:59:15,820
Nope.

6246
04:59:15,980 --> 04:59:16,960
What about up here?

6247
04:59:18,760 --> 04:59:20,620
Oh, I see that trap right there.

6248
04:59:21,740 --> 04:59:22,660
I see it.

6249
04:59:23,120 --> 04:59:24,280
What does it activate?

6250
04:59:24,660 --> 04:59:25,520
I don't understand.

6251
04:59:26,500 --> 04:59:27,600
Does it just explode?

6252
04:59:42,210 --> 04:59:43,370
Oh, here we go.

6253
04:59:45,050 --> 04:59:45,630
Thank you.

6254
04:59:47,230 --> 04:59:48,570
That looks like a trap too.

6255
04:59:52,390 --> 04:59:54,390
I have to be extra careful.

6256
04:59:56,170 --> 04:59:57,130
Anything else?

6257
05:00:02,050 --> 05:00:02,530
Ribbit.

6258
05:00:03,390 --> 05:00:04,470
Why are there so many traps?

6259
05:00:04,590 --> 05:00:04,830
Eva!

6260
05:00:08,990 --> 05:00:10,170
That's fucking mad.

6261
05:00:10,330 --> 05:00:11,870
Oh, she's busy with Vulcan.

6262
05:00:11,950 --> 05:00:12,290
That's right.

6263
05:00:14,330 --> 05:00:14,810
Zero.

6264
05:00:15,510 --> 05:00:16,490
Snake, watch out.

6265
05:00:16,610 --> 05:00:18,950
It seems that forest is rigged with a number of traps.

6266
05:00:18,950 --> 05:00:19,370
Yeah.

6267
05:00:20,410 --> 05:00:24,190
Most of the traps seem to be triggered by tripping a rope stretched across the ground.

6268
05:00:24,490 --> 05:00:24,770
What?

6269
05:00:24,890 --> 05:00:26,550
Don't just run around like a fool.

6270
05:00:26,550 --> 05:00:29,070
Keep an eye on the ground and watch where you step.

6271
05:00:29,590 --> 05:00:32,310
Some ropes may be placed so they're hidden in the vegetation.

6272
05:00:32,630 --> 05:00:35,190
Be extra careful when you're cutting through the underbrush.

6273
05:00:35,410 --> 05:00:35,730
Okay.

6274
05:00:35,970 --> 05:00:42,050
If you use the directional buttons to move around stalking, you should be able to spot the traps before you step on them.

6275
05:00:42,250 --> 05:00:42,670
Stalking?

6276
05:00:42,690 --> 05:00:45,370
Use stalking to move safely through suspicious-looking areas.

6277
05:00:47,650 --> 05:00:48,130
Okay.

6278
05:00:48,810 --> 05:00:49,770
I'm stalking.

6279
05:00:49,770 --> 05:00:50,670
I'm stalking.

6280
05:00:52,370 --> 05:00:53,330
I'm stalking.

6281
05:00:53,330 --> 05:00:54,070
I'm stalking.

6282
05:00:56,550 --> 05:00:58,130
I see a suspicious rope.

6283
05:00:59,590 --> 05:01:01,050
And I see a snake.

6284
05:01:02,150 --> 05:01:03,570
That could also be a rope.

6285
05:01:03,730 --> 05:01:05,070
This guy right here.

6286
05:01:05,510 --> 05:01:07,810
There's a squirrel climbing next to him.

6287
05:01:11,830 --> 05:01:15,730
He's dead and you're just gonna climb on his body?

6288
05:01:18,330 --> 05:01:20,110
Guys, he's just hanging out.

6289
05:01:22,330 --> 05:01:23,410
Where's the little squirrel?

6290
05:01:28,950 --> 05:01:29,830
Where is it?

6291
05:01:32,050 --> 05:01:32,950
Where'd the squirrel go?

6292
05:01:39,330 --> 05:01:39,970
Oh god.

6293
05:01:41,050 --> 05:01:43,350
I don't remember there being any guys here.

6294
05:01:43,470 --> 05:01:44,650
I think it's just traps for now.

6295
05:01:45,130 --> 05:01:46,310
Oh gosh, that scared me.

6296
05:01:47,290 --> 05:01:48,490
Okay, I'm stalking.

6297
05:01:50,410 --> 05:01:51,770
But I wanna get food too.

6298
05:01:52,270 --> 05:01:53,430
Wait, I'm all full on food.

6299
05:01:53,710 --> 05:01:55,850
Guess I should get rid of some stuff.

6300
05:01:56,090 --> 05:01:56,890
I'm not gonna...

6301
05:02:00,490 --> 05:02:01,370
I'm stalking.

6302
05:02:01,370 --> 05:02:02,490
I see the rope in front of me.

6303
05:02:03,950 --> 05:02:05,070
I'm stalking.

6304
05:02:06,290 --> 05:02:08,070
I'm gonna climb under the rope.

6305
05:02:10,550 --> 05:02:11,650
There's traps here.

6306
05:02:14,750 --> 05:02:15,870
I'm stalking.

6307
05:02:19,560 --> 05:02:20,120
Okay.

6308
05:02:20,320 --> 05:02:21,280
I see...

6309
05:02:21,280 --> 05:02:22,280
I see this one.

6310
05:02:22,400 --> 05:02:22,900
Oh my gosh.

6311
05:02:23,040 --> 05:02:25,300
Did you see the spikes just...

6312
05:02:25,300 --> 05:02:26,040
Oh!

6313
05:02:30,870 --> 05:02:31,430
Oh.

6314
05:02:40,500 --> 05:02:41,380
I'm stalking.

6315
05:02:41,700 --> 05:02:42,880
I don't see any others.

6316
05:02:44,420 --> 05:02:45,580
Oh my god.

6317
05:02:46,040 --> 05:02:48,200
How many scientists were sacrificed?

6318
05:02:51,820 --> 05:02:52,260
Ow!

6319
05:02:54,520 --> 05:02:55,660
Oh my god.

6320
05:02:57,100 --> 05:02:59,360
Just giving that log a big ol' hug.

6321
05:03:02,740 --> 05:03:04,500
Why is there one all the way over there?

6322
05:03:04,560 --> 05:03:05,300
Is there stuff out there?

6323
05:03:06,580 --> 05:03:07,280
Stop it game.

6324
05:03:07,320 --> 05:03:08,580
You're making me want to explore.

6325
05:03:09,840 --> 05:03:10,320
Game?

6326
05:03:11,300 --> 05:03:12,100
Stop it game.

6327
05:03:13,180 --> 05:03:14,820
That looks like a trap right there.

6328
05:03:15,240 --> 05:03:15,940
Is it not?

6329
05:03:17,120 --> 05:03:18,200
This thing right here?

6330
05:03:21,600 --> 05:03:22,380
That's a trap.

6331
05:03:32,580 --> 05:03:34,540
I think I'm just gonna leave.

6332
05:03:41,720 --> 05:03:42,860
I got lots of food.

6333
05:03:50,690 --> 05:03:52,010
The Gorky Labs.

6334
05:03:54,390 --> 05:03:55,590
The Gorky Labs.

6335
05:03:59,170 --> 05:03:59,650
Wait.

6336
05:03:59,710 --> 05:03:59,770
What?

6337
05:04:00,890 --> 05:04:01,370
I'm gonna leave.

6338
05:04:01,370 --> 05:04:02,710
Can't I dress up here?

6339
05:04:03,610 --> 05:04:04,890
Or I have to get inside first.

6340
05:04:05,770 --> 05:04:06,410
I guess.

6341
05:04:13,920 --> 05:04:14,640
I'mma leave.

6342
05:04:14,840 --> 05:04:15,180
Oh wait.

6343
05:04:16,860 --> 05:04:18,220
I'm all in all black.

6344
05:04:18,720 --> 05:04:20,820
Tracer responsible for 200 scientists deaths.

6345
05:04:20,820 --> 05:04:21,440
Oh my gosh.

6346
05:04:21,500 --> 05:04:21,680
Bye.

6347
05:04:21,680 --> 05:04:22,140
There he goes.

6348
05:04:22,220 --> 05:04:23,720
Thank you again for the super chat.

6349
05:04:24,720 --> 05:04:25,520
Thank you.

6350
05:04:25,740 --> 05:04:27,040
Is your wallet okay?

6351
05:04:27,560 --> 05:04:28,960
You've sent so many today.

6352
05:04:31,020 --> 05:04:31,500
Oh my gosh.

6353
05:04:31,500 --> 05:04:33,220
I gotta get inside first.

6354
05:04:33,860 --> 05:04:36,520
There is a little hole somewhere.

6355
05:04:40,520 --> 05:04:41,460
Oh my gosh.

6356
05:04:41,500 --> 05:04:42,400
The dogs.

6357
05:04:44,960 --> 05:04:46,560
Guys, I hate the dogs.

6358
05:04:51,300 --> 05:04:52,040
Oh my god.

6359
05:04:52,140 --> 05:04:52,700
Please.

6360
05:04:53,360 --> 05:04:53,920
Shoot.

6361
05:04:55,740 --> 05:04:56,300
Sticky.

6362
05:05:05,470 --> 05:05:06,870
Is that dog laying down?

6363
05:05:06,990 --> 05:05:07,830
On the job?

6364
05:05:09,610 --> 05:05:10,530
Why isn't it?

6365
05:05:10,610 --> 05:05:10,910
Okay.

6366
05:05:10,950 --> 05:05:11,230
Hold on.

6367
05:05:11,250 --> 05:05:12,570
What's wrong with my controller?

6368
05:05:12,750 --> 05:05:13,410
Why isn't it shooting?

6369
05:05:17,350 --> 05:05:18,510
I'm a little concerned.

6370
05:05:21,070 --> 05:05:21,630
Wait.

6371
05:05:21,790 --> 05:05:22,710
I think that's...

6372
05:05:22,710 --> 05:05:25,250
I can't tell if there's something there blocking him.

6373
05:05:29,870 --> 05:05:33,650
Isn't it like towards the end of the way that the entrance is at?

6374
05:05:34,850 --> 05:05:36,430
Guess we'll figure it out.

6375
05:05:38,990 --> 05:05:39,550
Huh?

6376
05:05:41,750 --> 05:05:42,310
Huh?

6377
05:05:42,710 --> 05:05:43,090
Huh?

6378
05:05:43,190 --> 05:05:43,750
Huh?

6379
05:05:43,770 --> 05:05:44,070
Huh?

6380
05:05:46,090 --> 05:05:46,470
Huh?

6381
05:05:48,370 --> 05:05:48,750
Huh?

6382
05:05:50,750 --> 05:05:51,470
Where is he?

6383
05:05:52,190 --> 05:05:52,870
Oh, there he is.

6384
05:06:01,470 --> 05:06:02,170
Oh my gosh.

6385
05:06:02,210 --> 05:06:02,450
Really?

6386
05:06:03,590 --> 05:06:04,570
To stop right there?

6387
05:06:04,630 --> 05:06:05,630
I'm not gonna be able to get you through there.

6388
05:06:05,750 --> 05:06:06,050
Please.

6389
05:06:06,090 --> 05:06:06,590
Turn around.

6390
05:06:06,790 --> 05:06:07,310
Or, I mean...

6391
05:06:07,310 --> 05:06:07,650
There's nothing here.

6392
05:06:07,850 --> 05:06:08,150
What?

6393
05:06:09,570 --> 05:06:09,950
Oh.

6394
05:06:10,310 --> 05:06:12,170
The dog is just asleep.

6395
05:06:13,770 --> 05:06:14,410
Of course.

6396
05:06:15,450 --> 05:06:17,070
The dog is just taking a nap.

6397
05:06:19,430 --> 05:06:19,810
Okay.

6398
05:06:19,810 --> 05:06:20,110
Okay.

6399
05:06:26,360 --> 05:06:26,840
I'm gonna take a nap.

6400
05:06:27,020 --> 05:06:27,200
Oh, my gosh.

6401
05:06:27,400 --> 05:06:28,200
Please, sir.

6402
05:06:30,920 --> 05:06:31,400
Oh!

6403
05:06:49,070 --> 05:06:50,270
Oh, my gosh.

6404
05:06:56,700 --> 05:06:57,180
Dog.

6405
05:06:59,660 --> 05:07:00,720
The dog is awake.

6406
05:07:08,420 --> 05:07:09,920
Am I excited for the remake?

6407
05:07:10,040 --> 05:07:11,400
Yes, I am.

6408
05:07:12,460 --> 05:07:13,400
Very excited.

6409
05:07:15,580 --> 05:07:16,060
Wait.

6410
05:07:16,160 --> 05:07:17,080
If I pretend to be a crow, I'm not.

6411
05:07:17,080 --> 05:07:17,300
He's a crocodile.

6412
05:07:17,800 --> 05:07:18,600
He won't care, right?

6413
05:07:26,240 --> 05:07:27,760
I have zero stealth.

6414
05:07:28,340 --> 05:07:28,640
What?

6415
05:07:28,740 --> 05:07:29,940
But it's like dark out.

6416
05:07:30,020 --> 05:07:31,660
How do I have zero stealth?

6417
05:07:32,460 --> 05:07:34,440
I'm so stealthy right now!

6418
05:07:38,340 --> 05:07:39,360
Works every time.

6419
05:07:41,340 --> 05:07:42,540
It's like right here, right?

6420
05:07:46,140 --> 05:07:48,040
Red and black!

6421
05:07:48,460 --> 05:07:49,380
Friend of Jack.

6422
05:07:50,580 --> 05:07:51,500
We're all good.

6423
05:07:59,270 --> 05:08:00,270
Anything around here?

6424
05:08:02,730 --> 05:08:03,210
Yes!

6425
05:08:05,650 --> 05:08:07,230
Master Collection just added Steam rewards.

6426
05:08:07,370 --> 05:08:08,750
Oh, I did see that!

6427
05:08:09,090 --> 05:08:09,990
Yeah, I did.

6428
05:08:12,390 --> 05:08:13,310
Which I...

6429
05:08:14,810 --> 05:08:18,950
I actually have to re-buy the Master Collection because it's on another account that I...

6430
05:08:20,010 --> 05:08:20,930
To get them.

6431
05:08:21,110 --> 05:08:22,750
It's on another account that I...

6432
05:08:23,330 --> 05:08:24,930
Have, so I have to...

6433
05:08:26,670 --> 05:08:27,710
Buy it again.

6434
05:08:28,270 --> 05:08:28,850
Which is fine.

6435
05:08:29,170 --> 05:08:29,650
Obviously.

6436
05:08:30,030 --> 05:08:32,150
But I've already bought it like maybe...

6437
05:08:32,650 --> 05:08:33,590
Like seven...

6438
05:08:33,590 --> 05:08:34,090
Seven...

6439
05:08:34,090 --> 05:08:35,930
Seven times or something.

6440
05:08:36,030 --> 05:08:36,510
I don't know.

6441
05:08:38,270 --> 05:08:38,750
So...

6442
05:08:39,050 --> 05:08:39,670
Kind of fun.

6443
05:08:39,930 --> 05:08:40,930
Have to buy it again.

6444
05:08:45,320 --> 05:08:45,940
That's right!

6445
05:08:46,440 --> 05:08:46,920
Oh...

6446
05:08:46,920 --> 05:08:48,100
We have to get...

6447
05:08:51,260 --> 05:08:52,780
The door is locked.

6448
05:08:57,990 --> 05:08:59,270
The door is locked.

6449
05:09:06,450 --> 05:09:07,230
What was it?

6450
05:09:08,610 --> 05:09:09,050
Um...

6451
05:09:10,110 --> 05:09:13,630
Snake, the enemy appears to be using that door to enter and exit the lab.

6452
05:09:13,830 --> 05:09:14,210
Yeah.

6453
05:09:14,330 --> 05:09:15,070
Think you can sneak in?

6454
05:09:15,370 --> 05:09:15,770
Well...

6455
05:09:15,770 --> 05:09:17,170
I can't open the door.

6456
05:09:17,970 --> 05:09:20,370
That door appears to be locked from the inside.

6457
05:09:20,710 --> 05:09:22,570
You won't be able to open it from the outside.

6458
05:09:22,850 --> 05:09:23,050
Okay.

6459
05:09:23,390 --> 05:09:26,210
But there must be some way to use the door to sneak inside.

6460
05:09:27,150 --> 05:09:28,210
And what do you propose?

6461
05:09:28,730 --> 05:09:29,330
Time to talk!

6462
05:09:29,470 --> 05:09:29,950
Well, I...

6463
05:09:29,950 --> 05:09:33,570
How about if you stand in front of the door and perform a ritual dance?

6464
05:09:33,570 --> 05:09:35,710
Paramedic is so stupid.

6465
05:09:36,450 --> 05:09:39,190
That's what they do in Japan when they find a door that won't open.

6466
05:09:39,410 --> 05:09:40,450
Are you serious?

6467
05:09:40,930 --> 05:09:41,510
Of course.

6468
05:09:41,830 --> 05:09:43,950
He certainly seems to know a lot about Japan.

6469
05:09:44,370 --> 05:09:46,450
Yeah, but this is the Soviet Union.

6470
05:09:46,710 --> 05:09:49,090
I don't think doing a dance is gonna make the door open.

6471
05:09:49,370 --> 05:09:52,350
The way she says it so matter-of-factly...

6472
05:09:52,350 --> 05:09:55,090
She says it with such gusto like...

6473
05:09:55,090 --> 05:09:59,570
How about you stand outside the door and perform a ritual dance?

6474
05:10:00,270 --> 05:10:00,810
Like...

6475
05:10:04,030 --> 05:10:05,370
It's so funny!

6476
05:10:06,970 --> 05:10:08,610
You say there are attack dogs?

6477
05:10:08,970 --> 05:10:09,210
Yeah.

6478
05:10:09,610 --> 05:10:11,670
Those attack dogs are Great Danes.

6479
05:10:11,670 --> 05:10:13,830
The breed is originally from Germany.

6480
05:10:14,210 --> 05:10:16,590
They've been used for hundreds of years as hunting dogs.

6481
05:10:16,870 --> 05:10:17,090
Wow.

6482
05:10:17,370 --> 05:10:19,230
As you can see, they're very large.

6483
05:10:19,550 --> 05:10:20,310
Strong, too.

6484
05:10:20,670 --> 05:10:22,970
They've got a calm yet courageous temperament.

6485
05:10:22,990 --> 05:10:25,070
And on top of that, they're extremely intelligent.

6486
05:10:25,490 --> 05:10:26,610
Well, they're pretty mean to me.

6487
05:10:26,690 --> 05:10:29,630
In some cases, a trained Great Dane can be more dangerous than a human opponent.

6488
05:10:30,210 --> 05:10:31,190
Watch out for them.

6489
05:10:32,170 --> 05:10:32,610
Interesting.

6490
05:10:32,610 --> 05:10:34,310
Forget it, Snake.

6491
05:10:34,910 --> 05:10:35,570
Forget what?

6492
05:10:36,250 --> 05:10:38,890
You were thinking about how they taste, weren't you?

6493
05:10:39,290 --> 05:10:40,750
I wasn't thinking.

6494
05:10:41,190 --> 05:10:41,990
Don't lie to me.

6495
05:10:42,190 --> 05:10:43,650
I could tell by the look on your face.

6496
05:10:43,650 --> 05:10:44,630
I wasn't thinking.

6497
05:10:44,630 --> 05:10:45,690
You can't see my face.

6498
05:10:46,090 --> 05:10:47,450
No, but I can imagine it.

6499
05:10:49,570 --> 05:10:52,170
Don't you dare think about trying to capture an attack dog.

6500
05:10:54,230 --> 05:10:55,250
You hear me?

6501
05:10:56,050 --> 05:10:56,810
Yeah, yeah.

6502
05:10:59,830 --> 05:11:00,270
Snake!

6503
05:11:01,030 --> 05:11:01,470
What?

6504
05:11:01,470 --> 05:11:01,570
What?

6505
05:11:01,990 --> 05:11:03,350
His grumbles.

6506
05:11:04,130 --> 05:11:04,610
Snake!

6507
05:11:06,210 --> 05:11:07,210
All he thinks...

6508
05:11:07,210 --> 05:11:07,790
Oh my gosh.

6509
05:11:07,790 --> 05:11:10,870
If Solid Snake had heard him, he would be so mad.

6510
05:11:12,930 --> 05:11:16,590
If Solid Snake had heard this whole conversation, he would be so mad.

6511
05:11:16,770 --> 05:11:18,090
Solid Snake loves dogs.

6512
05:11:19,350 --> 05:11:21,110
I mean, it's not a husky, but still.

6513
05:11:22,830 --> 05:11:25,050
Snake, be careful of those attack dogs.

6514
05:11:25,490 --> 05:11:26,190
Don't worry.

6515
05:11:26,490 --> 05:11:27,650
I know how dangerous they are.

6516
05:11:27,650 --> 05:11:28,890
Oh, we get another thing about the dogs.

6517
05:11:29,030 --> 05:11:30,970
No, you're the one who's dangerous.

6518
05:11:31,550 --> 05:11:31,990
Me?

6519
05:11:32,690 --> 05:11:36,390
Those dogs are just innocent animals, even if they've been trained to kill.

6520
05:11:36,570 --> 05:11:38,510
You shouldn't hurt them unless you have to.

6521
05:11:38,770 --> 05:11:39,210
What?

6522
05:11:39,550 --> 05:11:44,290
You know, humans and dogs have been living together for 50,000 years, ever since the Stone Age.

6523
05:11:45,050 --> 05:11:49,650
Sure, they make good pets and watch dogs, but they also help us out in a variety of different fields.

6524
05:11:50,010 --> 05:11:55,470
Not just as police and army dogs, but as hunters, shepherds, rescuers, and seeing-eye dogs.

6525
05:11:56,110 --> 05:11:57,570
They deserve our respect.

6526
05:11:58,210 --> 05:11:59,230
I know what you mean.

6527
05:11:59,690 --> 05:12:00,950
I'm a dog sled, better than you.

6528
05:12:00,950 --> 05:12:01,450
I'm a dog sled fan myself.

6529
05:12:01,970 --> 05:12:06,290
In the future, many of the jobs that dogs do now will probably be taken over by machines.

6530
05:12:07,230 --> 05:12:10,950
They'll have miniature unmanned reconnaissance vehicle and security systems.

6531
05:12:11,370 --> 05:12:11,890
No AI.

6532
05:12:11,890 --> 05:12:16,250
And in the 21st century, I'll bet they'll even be selling robot dogs as pets.

6533
05:12:16,950 --> 05:12:18,450
You've got to be kidding.

6534
05:12:18,930 --> 05:12:20,210
You've got to be kidding.

6535
05:12:20,390 --> 05:12:22,150
But even if that happens, dogs will still be our most trusted companions.

6536
05:12:22,150 --> 05:12:23,270
You said dog sled, man.

6537
05:12:23,590 --> 05:12:24,870
Unmanned recon vehicle.

6538
05:12:25,670 --> 05:12:27,150
That's a pretty scary thought.

6539
05:12:27,590 --> 05:12:30,350
Well, for now, trained dogs are the best they've got.

6540
05:12:30,450 --> 05:12:30,930
I'm a dog sled.

6541
05:12:30,950 --> 05:12:31,810
Is that where he learned?

6542
05:12:32,650 --> 05:12:33,310
You think?

6543
05:12:33,430 --> 05:12:34,150
Is that where he learned?

6544
05:12:52,790 --> 05:12:53,750
Thank you.

6545
05:13:14,360 --> 05:13:15,180
Great security.

6546
05:13:15,580 --> 05:13:16,060
Absolutely.

6547
05:13:18,420 --> 05:13:20,520
I am going to save.

6548
05:13:22,960 --> 05:13:23,440
Save.

6549
05:13:25,080 --> 05:13:25,320
Save.

6550
05:13:25,780 --> 05:13:29,320
I haven't seen anything from this game, but it's way funnier than I thought it would be.

6551
05:13:29,340 --> 05:13:31,080
That's the thing about Metal Gear.

6552
05:13:31,260 --> 05:13:33,280
People think it's just like some crazy...

6553
05:13:33,280 --> 05:13:35,580
Some crazy like...

6554
05:13:36,480 --> 05:13:37,300
What's the word?

6555
05:13:38,400 --> 05:13:38,880
Like...

6556
05:13:39,420 --> 05:13:39,900
Army...

6557
05:13:39,900 --> 05:13:41,060
Whatever game.

6558
05:13:41,200 --> 05:13:42,740
But it actually has so much character.

6559
05:13:43,000 --> 05:13:47,790
It's so funny.

6560
05:13:48,410 --> 05:13:49,010
Uh oh.

6561
05:14:14,650 --> 05:14:16,470
I'm the one that knocks.

6562
05:14:18,010 --> 05:14:19,690
So let's take out all the recessive genes.

6563
05:14:19,690 --> 05:14:22,210
That means dog sledding is a recessive genetic trait.

6564
05:14:28,540 --> 05:14:29,940
Give me a second.

6565
05:14:32,860 --> 05:14:34,700
I'm going to restart my PS2.

6566
05:14:39,030 --> 05:14:39,550
Ah!

6567
05:14:39,570 --> 05:14:40,010
Oh shit.

6568
05:14:45,670 --> 05:14:46,330
Let's see.

6569
05:14:53,650 --> 05:14:54,970
It might have saved.

6570
05:14:55,010 --> 05:14:55,430
We'll see.

6571
05:14:55,610 --> 05:14:56,790
Because that's how it was before.

6572
05:14:57,190 --> 05:14:58,210
It might have saved.

6573
05:14:58,230 --> 05:14:58,650
Let's see.

6574
05:15:01,510 --> 05:15:02,290
Let's see.

6575
05:15:03,230 --> 05:15:04,710
Perform a ritual dance.

6576
05:15:06,450 --> 05:15:07,050
Yeah.

6577
05:15:07,170 --> 05:15:13,170
We'll perform a ritual dance in front of my PS2.

6578
05:15:35,210 --> 05:15:36,850
I hope it saved.

6579
05:15:40,190 --> 05:15:41,390
I hope it saved.

6580
05:15:41,390 --> 05:15:41,610
I hope it's saved.

6581
05:15:49,600 --> 05:15:51,080
I hope it's saved.

6582
05:15:59,190 --> 05:15:59,870
Let's see.

6583
05:16:00,970 --> 05:16:01,810
I'm nervous.

6584
05:16:07,480 --> 05:16:08,560
Fingies crossed, everybody.

6585
05:16:08,700 --> 05:16:09,120
Fingies crossed.

6586
05:16:13,420 --> 05:16:15,360
I would love to listen, but...

6587
05:16:17,260 --> 05:16:18,160
We're on a mission.

6588
05:16:31,580 --> 05:16:33,180
Hello everybody!

6589
05:16:33,620 --> 05:16:39,200
And welcome back to Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence.

6590
05:16:40,140 --> 05:16:41,800
Oh my gosh.

6591
05:16:41,960 --> 05:16:45,160
Starting nice and early today on this Sunday afternoon.

6592
05:16:53,120 --> 05:16:53,820
Here we go.

6593
05:16:53,900 --> 05:16:54,460
Moment of truth.

6594
05:16:55,500 --> 05:17:00,120
Is this the one?

6595
05:17:00,360 --> 05:17:01,200
Let's see.

6596
05:17:37,700 --> 05:17:39,360
Maybe I should have waited longer.

6597
05:17:39,840 --> 05:17:43,860
Maybe that's why it worked before because I waited a long time before I like...

6598
05:17:43,860 --> 05:17:44,800
Because I was like, maybe.

6599
05:17:49,800 --> 05:17:50,280
Wait,

6600
05:17:59,370 --> 05:18:00,170
did I get the...

6601
05:18:00,170 --> 05:18:02,730
Oh my gosh.

6602
05:18:02,870 --> 05:18:03,310
No!

6603
05:18:04,150 --> 05:18:05,930
It took us back so far!

6604
05:18:11,600 --> 05:18:13,300
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

6605
05:18:23,680 --> 05:18:24,840
Okay, we did get it.

6606
05:18:25,000 --> 05:18:25,280
Okay.

6607
05:18:32,520 --> 05:18:34,680
We're just gonna do exactly what we did before.

6608
05:18:34,960 --> 05:18:36,120
I'm gonna kill everybody.

6609
05:18:39,360 --> 05:18:41,000
I'm so sorry, you guys.

6610
05:18:41,720 --> 05:18:43,140
I'm so sorry.

6611
05:18:45,320 --> 05:18:47,300
I'm debating whether to end stream.

6612
05:18:47,360 --> 05:18:49,000
I didn't want to finish so early.

6613
05:18:49,200 --> 05:18:51,040
I wanted to really get past the fear.

6614
05:18:52,300 --> 05:18:53,860
Micmac, thanks for the 5 gifted.

6615
05:19:02,860 --> 05:19:03,260
Uh...

6616
05:19:06,630 --> 05:19:07,690
Woah, woah, woah.

6617
05:19:07,850 --> 05:19:08,470
Woah, woah.

6618
05:19:08,690 --> 05:19:09,510
Woah, woah, woah.

6619
05:19:09,550 --> 05:19:10,610
I'm not doing that, you guys!

6620
05:19:10,770 --> 05:19:11,490
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

6621
05:19:11,630 --> 05:19:12,670
My controller is drifting!

6622
05:19:13,050 --> 05:19:13,750
Woah, woah, woah.

6623
05:19:14,070 --> 05:19:14,710
Woah, woah, woah.

6624
05:19:17,910 --> 05:19:19,590
Okay, I'm ending the stream today.

6625
05:19:20,770 --> 05:19:22,450
My controller is...

6626
05:19:23,510 --> 05:19:24,250
What's happening?

6627
05:19:24,530 --> 05:19:25,210
Oh my gosh.

6628
05:19:32,120 --> 05:19:33,120
Why is it doing that?

6629
05:19:37,390 --> 05:19:38,310
Yeah, yeah.

6630
05:19:40,590 --> 05:19:42,210
Oh, Psycho Mantis is real.

6631
05:19:42,710 --> 05:19:43,590
What is happening?

6632
05:19:44,410 --> 05:19:45,710
Unplug it, plug it back in.

6633
05:19:45,810 --> 05:19:46,530
Yeah, let's try that.

6634
05:20:01,820 --> 05:20:02,260
Okay.

6635
05:20:03,260 --> 05:20:05,780
Oh my gosh, that freaked me out so bad!

6636
05:20:06,180 --> 05:20:06,740
Okay, we're okay.

6637
05:20:06,780 --> 05:20:07,340
We're okay, everybody.

6638
05:20:08,740 --> 05:20:10,100
That was freaky.

6639
05:20:10,380 --> 05:20:11,540
That was so freaky.

6640
05:20:11,940 --> 05:20:13,580
It's like it's really telling me to...

6641
05:20:14,300 --> 05:20:15,060
To quit.

6642
05:20:17,260 --> 05:20:18,740
It's really telling me to quit, huh?

6643
05:20:27,510 --> 05:20:28,850
Let's just do the same thing.

6644
05:20:29,710 --> 05:20:30,490
I did before.

6645
05:20:41,100 --> 05:20:41,780
Oh,

6646
05:20:45,440 --> 05:20:46,180
I got his...

6647
05:20:48,080 --> 05:20:49,660
Oh, dang it.

6648
05:20:50,500 --> 05:20:51,180
No!

6649
05:20:53,760 --> 05:20:54,640
What's wrong?

6650
05:20:57,740 --> 05:20:58,500
What's wrong?

6651
05:20:59,400 --> 05:21:00,840
Nice radio shot.

6652
05:21:00,920 --> 05:21:01,360
Thank you.

6653
05:21:03,660 --> 05:21:04,640
Oh, dang it.

6654
05:21:11,690 --> 05:21:12,770
I'm gonna get your leggy.

6655
05:21:13,610 --> 05:21:14,250
Actually...

6656
05:21:15,550 --> 05:21:17,350
I got you in the butt!

6657
05:21:32,970 --> 05:21:33,290
Alrighty.

6658
05:21:37,230 --> 05:21:37,870
Evil!

6659
05:21:38,350 --> 05:21:40,150
You guys, we have to speedrun!

6660
05:21:41,490 --> 05:21:42,390
Waka waka.

6661
05:21:42,430 --> 05:21:43,170
Waka waka.

6662
05:21:43,290 --> 05:21:44,010
Waka waka.

6663
05:21:44,230 --> 05:21:44,910
Waka waka.

6664
05:21:47,950 --> 05:21:49,530
It's the Croc hat, everybody.

6665
05:21:49,990 --> 05:21:50,630
Remember.

6666
05:21:50,630 --> 05:21:54,790
Remember, Crock Hat does make you do cruel, cruel things.

6667
05:21:56,510 --> 05:21:58,610
Cruel, cruel, cruel things.

6668
05:22:05,420 --> 05:22:07,340
The strats are blowing my mind.

6669
05:22:07,420 --> 05:22:07,920
What do you mean?

6670
05:22:09,460 --> 05:22:10,800
Oh, because I blew them up?

6671
05:22:10,900 --> 05:22:11,620
I get it.

6672
05:22:12,200 --> 05:22:13,040
I get it.

6673
05:22:16,560 --> 05:22:18,200
I just feel bad.

6674
05:22:18,340 --> 05:22:20,440
I feel bad that I have to repeat so much.

6675
05:22:24,020 --> 05:22:27,660
And I had such a clean entrance into the facility.

6676
05:22:28,280 --> 05:22:29,120
So unfair.

6677
05:22:30,500 --> 05:22:31,820
Where did that guy go, anyway?

6678
05:22:33,100 --> 05:22:34,320
Oh, there's some stuff down there.

6679
05:22:41,140 --> 05:22:44,520
I know it's not my fault, but it just makes me feel bad, anyway.

6680
05:22:44,980 --> 05:22:46,220
Just makes me feel bad.

6681
05:22:47,260 --> 05:22:48,240
Feels bad, man.

6682
05:22:48,800 --> 05:22:49,380
You know.

6683
05:22:54,670 --> 05:22:55,710
What was that?

6684
05:22:55,930 --> 05:22:56,770
Wait, where did it go?

6685
05:22:58,110 --> 05:22:58,990
What was that?

6686
05:23:00,030 --> 05:23:00,830
It disappeared.

6687
05:23:01,010 --> 05:23:03,230
It went bloop and left.

6688
05:23:04,870 --> 05:23:05,650
Where did it go?

6689
05:23:07,730 --> 05:23:08,130
What?

6690
05:23:11,430 --> 05:23:12,190
That was weird.

6691
05:23:15,030 --> 05:23:17,150
Hopefully, I can do this one just as cleanly.

6692
05:23:17,270 --> 05:23:19,170
This room is really not that difficult, though.

6693
05:23:20,630 --> 05:23:22,090
It ain't so bad, I guess.

6694
05:23:23,310 --> 05:23:24,050
Was there...

6695
05:23:24,690 --> 05:23:26,990
There's another suppressor in here and then we'll have...

6696
05:23:27,570 --> 05:23:28,370
I'll give it this way.

6697
05:23:28,410 --> 05:23:29,530
More MGS3 to play.

6698
05:23:29,630 --> 05:23:30,230
Yippee!

6699
05:23:36,540 --> 05:23:38,400
Yeah, I'm gonna get a second one.

6700
05:23:38,620 --> 05:23:38,820
Okay.

6701
05:23:49,900 --> 05:23:51,300
Yeah, the suppressor's in here.

6702
05:23:51,520 --> 05:23:52,080
Yes, yes.

6703
05:24:00,120 --> 05:24:03,400
I just have to do it perfectly or else I'm like, oof.

6704
05:24:07,360 --> 05:24:08,320
Or else...

6705
05:24:12,830 --> 05:24:15,110
Or else... it's not so good.

6706
05:24:18,950 --> 05:24:19,930
Where are you guys?

6707
05:24:20,210 --> 05:24:20,870
Oh, there you are.

6708
05:24:22,150 --> 05:24:28,210
Okay, we're gonna wait for him to come over here because he gets blocked by the boxes and I can take him out with no one noticing.

6709
05:24:31,830 --> 05:24:33,330
Like, right about...

6710
05:24:34,850 --> 05:24:35,650
Right about...

6711
05:24:36,390 --> 05:24:37,210
Where you're standing.

6712
05:24:39,230 --> 05:24:39,670
Yeah.

6713
05:24:41,870 --> 05:24:44,490
And then we scoots our butts over here.

6714
05:24:45,130 --> 05:24:47,330
We scoots our butts over here.

6715
05:24:48,210 --> 05:24:50,630
We scoots our butts over here.

6716
05:24:52,010 --> 05:24:53,670
And no one notices us.

6717
05:24:56,470 --> 05:24:57,830
Okay, there's our other guy.

6718
05:25:14,180 --> 05:25:15,240
Where's the other guy?

6719
05:25:17,520 --> 05:25:18,860
Where's our upstairs friend?

6720
05:25:19,060 --> 05:25:19,540
Oh, there he is.

6721
05:25:19,740 --> 05:25:23,020
And I'm gonna go here and crouch.

6722
05:25:23,640 --> 05:25:24,720
And up.

6723
05:25:25,020 --> 05:25:25,620
Oop.

6724
05:25:25,620 --> 05:25:25,900
Yep.

6725
05:25:26,860 --> 05:25:27,460
And...

6726
05:25:27,460 --> 05:25:29,140
Actually, I'm gonna...

6727
05:25:29,820 --> 05:25:30,420
Mm...

6728
05:25:30,420 --> 05:25:31,980
I will wait.

6729
05:25:31,980 --> 05:25:32,060
I'm gonna wait.

6730
05:25:32,060 --> 05:25:33,280
I will wait until he gets closer.

6731
05:25:34,140 --> 05:25:40,200
I'm gonna wait until he actually gets up there.

6732
05:25:44,860 --> 05:25:46,840
Lined up just for his grave, I know.

6733
05:25:51,740 --> 05:25:53,000
Might take a second though.

6734
05:26:01,040 --> 05:26:02,820
I don't trust my aim so far.

6735
05:26:02,980 --> 05:26:04,480
That's why I'm waiting for him to get closer.

6736
05:26:06,160 --> 05:26:06,280
Ha!

6737
05:26:06,420 --> 05:26:06,660
Ha!

6738
05:26:06,740 --> 05:26:07,020
Ha!

6739
05:26:07,060 --> 05:26:07,260
Ha!

6740
05:26:09,460 --> 05:26:11,220
Might help if I have it equipped.

6741
05:26:14,580 --> 05:26:15,120
Please!

6742
05:26:15,760 --> 05:26:16,460
There we go.

6743
05:26:16,800 --> 05:26:17,700
Goodness gracious.

6744
05:26:21,380 --> 05:26:21,920
Alright!

6745
05:26:21,920 --> 05:26:23,700
Recollect everything that I lost.

6746
05:26:24,200 --> 05:26:24,740
Please.

6747
05:26:27,860 --> 05:26:28,400
Dang,

6748
05:26:31,480 --> 05:26:31,760
Minto.

6749
05:26:33,160 --> 05:26:34,180
I'm telling you.

6750
05:26:35,520 --> 05:26:37,360
Sometimes I just gotta get a microphone.

6751
05:26:37,520 --> 05:26:39,400
I gotta get a little move.

6752
05:26:39,720 --> 05:26:41,020
I gotta get a little boogie in me.

6753
05:26:48,480 --> 05:26:49,980
That's why I never pick my nose.

6754
05:26:52,540 --> 05:26:54,240
I always got a little boogie in me.

6755
05:27:05,280 --> 05:27:06,160
She's in the zone.

6756
05:27:10,400 --> 05:27:11,920
Oh, and we gotta...

6757
05:27:12,740 --> 05:27:14,920
So nicely blow up there.

6758
05:27:16,280 --> 05:27:16,960
Wait.

6759
05:27:17,140 --> 05:27:17,680
There we go.

6760
05:27:18,980 --> 05:27:19,320
Here.

6761
05:27:23,900 --> 05:27:24,580
Okay.

6762
05:27:25,360 --> 05:27:26,380
La la la.

6763
05:27:26,920 --> 05:27:27,260
Leave.

6764
05:27:27,460 --> 05:27:28,340
Leave this place.

6765
05:27:30,140 --> 05:27:31,220
Good one, dad.

6766
05:27:31,460 --> 05:27:32,080
Thanks.

6767
05:27:33,860 --> 05:27:35,740
That should be everything in this room.

6768
05:27:36,320 --> 05:27:37,340
I believe.

6769
05:27:37,340 --> 05:27:37,380
I believe.

6770
05:27:56,100 --> 05:27:56,620
Alright.

6771
05:27:57,600 --> 05:28:00,120
I missed this part of the stream, so this is an absolute win.

6772
05:28:00,320 --> 05:28:01,380
Oh, lucky you.

6773
05:28:02,760 --> 05:28:03,760
I will...

6774
05:28:03,760 --> 05:28:04,700
Let's see.

6775
05:28:04,740 --> 05:28:05,400
Let's eat.

6776
05:28:06,360 --> 05:28:07,880
We'll grab something.

6777
05:28:17,390 --> 05:28:18,430
This works.

6778
05:28:20,030 --> 05:28:20,550
Okay.

6779
05:28:22,090 --> 05:28:22,610
Alright.

6780
05:28:22,710 --> 05:28:24,130
Now I just gotta be careful of traps.

6781
05:28:25,510 --> 05:28:26,030
And...

6782
05:28:26,030 --> 05:28:26,290
Oh.

6783
05:28:26,290 --> 05:28:27,570
What was this stuff up there?

6784
05:28:27,650 --> 05:28:28,890
Was it anything that I could take?

6785
05:28:29,130 --> 05:28:31,690
Actually, I honestly can't even remember.

6786
05:28:33,630 --> 05:28:35,690
Like, I see the little floaty box up there.

6787
05:28:35,750 --> 05:28:39,590
I can't remember if it was something that I even was able to get.

6788
05:28:42,150 --> 05:28:43,370
No, I shot down a snake.

6789
05:28:44,110 --> 05:28:45,270
I shot down that guy.

6790
05:28:47,650 --> 05:28:48,430
I went up here...

6791
05:28:48,430 --> 05:28:49,270
Yeah, I went up here for a snake.

6792
05:28:49,330 --> 05:28:51,590
I can't remember.

6793
05:28:53,010 --> 05:28:54,050
Be careful of traps.

6794
05:28:54,130 --> 05:28:54,870
Oh, what's that over there?

6795
05:28:55,670 --> 05:28:58,270
I never noticed that spinny thing.

6796
05:28:58,450 --> 05:28:58,950
What is that?

6797
05:28:59,630 --> 05:29:00,290
Okay, hold on.

6798
05:29:00,370 --> 05:29:01,410
I'm not gonna get caught.

6799
05:29:02,470 --> 05:29:03,130
You guys?

6800
05:29:07,630 --> 05:29:08,290
You guys?

6801
05:29:09,650 --> 05:29:10,090
Okay.

6802
05:29:12,560 --> 05:29:13,580
Oh, I'm in the quicksand.

6803
05:29:16,680 --> 05:29:17,540
Oh, ow!

6804
05:29:17,700 --> 05:29:18,500
I'm getting kissed here?

6805
05:29:19,580 --> 05:29:20,400
In the quicksand?

6806
05:29:22,840 --> 05:29:23,620
That was close.

6807
05:29:23,940 --> 05:29:25,540
That was actually kinda close, wasn't it?

6808
05:29:31,420 --> 05:29:32,180
What is this?

6809
05:29:34,400 --> 05:29:35,400
I got chewed.

6810
05:29:35,580 --> 05:29:36,100
I got chewed.

6811
05:29:36,460 --> 05:29:38,420
I got a snake.

6812
05:29:39,680 --> 05:29:40,580
What is this?

6813
05:29:42,880 --> 05:29:45,060
What is that part right there?

6814
05:29:45,120 --> 05:29:46,100
That looks like a trap, right?

6815
05:29:46,640 --> 05:29:48,260
Yeah, that must be a trap.

6816
05:29:51,160 --> 05:29:52,580
Is this a dirty magazine?

6817
05:29:53,320 --> 05:29:54,700
Oh my god!

6818
05:29:58,360 --> 05:29:58,880
Worth?

6819
05:30:01,600 --> 05:30:02,120
Probably.

6820
05:30:02,260 --> 05:30:02,700
Okay.

6821
05:30:02,700 --> 05:30:03,180
Okay.

6822
05:30:04,020 --> 05:30:04,620
Actually worth.

6823
05:30:06,320 --> 05:30:08,840
What I'm gonna do is knock on the door and then leave the magazine.

6824
05:30:09,360 --> 05:30:10,540
And then he'll be like, Whoa!

6825
05:30:12,240 --> 05:30:12,640
Magazine!

6826
05:30:14,880 --> 05:30:16,300
He'll be like, Oh my gosh!

6827
05:30:16,420 --> 05:30:18,360
That squirrel scared me!

6828
05:30:19,240 --> 05:30:20,320
Oh, what did I just kill?

6829
05:30:21,600 --> 05:30:22,340
Accidental death?

6830
05:30:24,940 --> 05:30:25,740
Involuntary manslaughter.

6831
05:30:26,480 --> 05:30:27,100
My bad.

6832
05:30:29,180 --> 05:30:30,800
Okay, I think I'm just gonna keep on going.

6833
05:30:34,820 --> 05:30:35,920
Yeah, let's just go.

6834
05:30:40,290 --> 05:30:41,610
Am I going in the right direction?

6835
05:30:44,510 --> 05:30:46,110
Look for the dead scientists.

6836
05:30:46,730 --> 05:30:48,050
They'll guide your way.

6837
05:30:48,390 --> 05:30:48,530
Oh!

6838
05:30:49,170 --> 05:30:49,870
Wait a second.

6839
05:30:52,430 --> 05:30:55,150
Give me the blocos!

6840
05:31:02,980 --> 05:31:03,820
Okay, see that?

6841
05:31:06,080 --> 05:31:06,960
I'm stalking.

6842
05:31:06,980 --> 05:31:07,720
I'm stalking.

6843
05:31:08,640 --> 05:31:09,860
Am I going the right way?

6844
05:31:10,040 --> 05:31:10,300
Oh!

6845
05:31:19,040 --> 05:31:19,780
That's a trap.

6846
05:31:19,900 --> 05:31:20,720
I thought that was a squirrel.

6847
05:31:22,120 --> 05:31:22,840
That's a rabbit.

6848
05:31:23,120 --> 05:31:23,820
Not a trap.

6849
05:31:25,600 --> 05:31:25,960
No!

6850
05:31:26,240 --> 05:31:26,600
Rabbit!

6851
05:31:26,740 --> 05:31:27,580
Don't go to the trap!

6852
05:31:28,760 --> 05:31:29,780
Wait, there's another book.

6853
05:31:31,720 --> 05:31:32,580
Should I get it?

6854
05:31:33,040 --> 05:31:34,120
Do you think this is a trap?

6855
05:31:39,190 --> 05:31:39,970
Two for one deal.

6856
05:31:41,110 --> 05:31:41,850
Oh, it's food.

6857
05:31:42,030 --> 05:31:42,670
Oh, it's ramen!

6858
05:31:44,610 --> 05:31:45,390
Thought it was a book.

6859
05:31:49,220 --> 05:31:50,300
Eat all my crabs.

6860
05:31:50,500 --> 05:31:51,220
Eat all my crabs.

6861
05:31:51,700 --> 05:31:52,360
This works.

6862
05:31:57,070 --> 05:31:57,470
Nice.

6863
05:31:58,170 --> 05:31:58,570
Okay.

6864
05:31:59,110 --> 05:32:00,190
I'm a little lost.

6865
05:32:00,370 --> 05:32:00,750
Oh, wait!

6866
05:32:01,210 --> 05:32:01,790
Kera-tan!

6867
05:32:03,030 --> 05:32:04,690
This is the guy that's hugging the tree.

6868
05:32:05,170 --> 05:32:06,250
So we go this way.

6869
05:32:06,390 --> 05:32:07,250
I know where we are.

6870
05:32:07,790 --> 05:32:08,670
I'm not lost.

6871
05:32:08,990 --> 05:32:09,870
Can I cut him down?

6872
05:32:10,190 --> 05:32:10,770
You think?

6873
05:32:12,430 --> 05:32:13,010
Thank you!

6874
05:32:14,970 --> 05:32:15,750
Chu gacha?

6875
05:32:15,910 --> 05:32:16,810
Oh, you can't hear it.

6876
05:32:16,870 --> 05:32:18,030
But it was your simp.

6877
05:32:19,570 --> 05:32:20,430
Sorry, Ashes.

6878
05:32:22,130 --> 05:32:22,530
Thank you!

6879
05:32:23,030 --> 05:32:23,430
Chu!

6880
05:32:24,950 --> 05:32:25,550
There you go.

6881
05:32:25,550 --> 05:32:25,670
I'll just put it up there.

6882
05:32:27,490 --> 05:32:33,730
It meant nothing because it wasn't earned from doing a poll.

6883
05:32:34,330 --> 05:32:35,330
But that's okay.

6884
05:32:35,470 --> 05:32:36,330
It was a pity one.

6885
05:32:39,150 --> 05:32:40,990
It was a pity one.

6886
05:32:45,870 --> 05:32:47,010
A pity Chu.

6887
05:32:52,160 --> 05:32:53,260
Poor scientists.

6888
05:32:55,480 --> 05:32:56,700
The Gorky Lab.

6889
05:33:02,450 --> 05:33:04,770
Gosh, the sound effect sounds so...

6890
05:33:04,770 --> 05:33:05,490
There you go.

6891
05:33:05,490 --> 05:33:07,270
Like, realistic sometimes.

6892
05:33:07,630 --> 05:33:13,900
Like, that sounds like a real bird.

6893
05:33:16,920 --> 05:33:17,780
You know?

6894
05:33:27,840 --> 05:33:29,060
There we go.

6895
05:33:30,900 --> 05:33:32,560
Sometimes it takes me a second.

6896
05:33:33,460 --> 05:33:34,420
Where's the dog?

6897
05:33:34,700 --> 05:33:35,600
There he is.

6898
05:33:43,110 --> 05:33:44,750
Oh, did he notice?

6899
05:33:51,680 --> 05:33:52,580
There he is.

6900
05:33:53,760 --> 05:33:54,280
Okay.

6901
05:33:57,420 --> 05:33:58,260
Save check.

6902
05:33:59,480 --> 05:34:01,200
I don't want to...

6903
05:34:02,420 --> 05:34:04,320
Maybe I should do it here, actually.

6904
05:34:04,900 --> 05:34:07,360
Maybe I should save here instead of inside.

6905
05:34:07,480 --> 05:34:09,940
Maybe inside is like a cursed place, right?

6906
05:34:11,020 --> 05:34:12,480
So maybe I should do it here.

6907
05:34:17,200 --> 05:34:18,440
Gonna do a new file.

6908
05:34:18,900 --> 05:34:19,420
Everybody...

6909
05:34:19,860 --> 05:34:20,680
Can't use file 4.

6910
05:34:22,960 --> 05:34:24,480
Use a different memory card.

6911
05:34:25,020 --> 05:34:25,680
Wait, why?

6912
05:34:33,380 --> 05:34:34,680
4 is cursed?

6913
05:34:34,880 --> 05:34:35,320
For real?

6914
05:34:52,860 --> 05:34:53,680
Uh-oh.

6915
05:35:05,600 --> 05:35:06,780
No, it's not full.

6916
05:35:13,460 --> 05:35:14,240
Overwrite 1?

6917
05:35:15,320 --> 05:35:15,880
Maybe...

6918
05:35:15,880 --> 05:35:16,960
I'm afraid of...

6919
05:35:16,960 --> 05:35:18,540
Yeah, this one is 6 hours ago.

6920
05:35:18,720 --> 05:35:19,120
So...

6921
05:35:19,900 --> 05:35:21,380
Or not 6 hours ago, you know.

6922
05:35:34,860 --> 05:35:37,100
Snake, have you ever seen On the Beach?

6923
05:35:37,620 --> 05:35:38,140
No.

6924
05:35:38,640 --> 05:35:39,540
Don't know it.

6925
05:35:39,940 --> 05:35:42,600
It's about the survivors of the Third World War.

6926
05:35:43,080 --> 05:35:47,000
The entire Northern Hemisphere is obliterated in the nuclear holocaust.

6927
05:35:47,100 --> 05:35:52,360
And it's only a matter of time before the few survivors left in the Southern Hemisphere are poisoned by the deadly fallout.

6928
05:35:52,900 --> 05:35:57,120
Their only hope is an American nuclear submarine that escapes to the Southern Hemisphere.

6929
05:35:57,440 --> 05:36:00,040
They set out for the Arctic to investigate the fallout.

6930
05:36:00,040 --> 05:36:02,480
The movie came out in 59.

6931
05:36:02,900 --> 05:36:05,800
And the year that the war was supposed to happen was 1964.

6932
05:36:06,620 --> 05:36:08,820
In other words, this year.

6933
05:36:09,200 --> 05:36:10,120
Nice warning.

6934
05:36:10,760 --> 05:36:12,520
Let's hope it stays just a movie.

6935
05:36:13,840 --> 05:36:16,060
Oh, I thought you would talk some more.

6936
05:36:16,120 --> 05:36:16,400
Hold on.

6937
05:36:19,400 --> 05:36:21,040
You got some instant noodles, huh?

6938
05:36:21,600 --> 05:36:22,480
Instant noodles?

6939
05:36:23,240 --> 05:36:23,860
Uh-huh.

6940
05:36:23,900 --> 05:36:25,840
It was invented in Japan just recently.

6941
05:36:26,180 --> 05:36:28,300
Add some hot water and it's ready to eat.

6942
05:36:28,960 --> 05:36:30,020
It's cheap and can be eaten.

6943
05:36:30,020 --> 05:36:31,260
It can be stored for a long time.

6944
05:36:31,380 --> 05:36:32,920
And besides, it's delicious.

6945
05:36:33,140 --> 05:36:33,940
We got this one earlier.

6946
05:36:34,160 --> 05:36:34,560
It's like a miracle food.

6947
05:36:34,900 --> 05:36:35,340
Wow.

6948
05:36:38,360 --> 05:36:39,440
Tell me something different.

6949
05:36:39,640 --> 05:36:41,520
Actually, Sagan, we haven't talked to you in a while.

6950
05:36:41,800 --> 05:36:43,740
Looks like you're using splitter face paint.

6951
05:36:44,820 --> 05:36:46,400
Splitter is an indoor face paint.

6952
05:36:46,980 --> 05:36:50,780
Painting your face with splitter should help you blend in better when you're infiltrating a building.

6953
05:36:51,120 --> 05:36:51,300
Ah.

6954
05:36:52,880 --> 05:36:53,320
Whoa.

6955
05:36:53,740 --> 05:36:54,580
Hold on.

6956
05:36:55,880 --> 05:36:58,420
All I got was two slices of pizza, you guys.

6957
05:36:58,420 --> 05:36:59,220
Hold on.

6958
05:37:01,460 --> 05:37:02,300
Paramag, please.

6959
05:37:03,160 --> 05:37:03,800
Save me.

6960
05:37:04,040 --> 05:37:08,540
When you're bitten by a venomous animal such as a snake or a spider or hit by a poisoned arrow...

6961
05:37:08,980 --> 05:37:10,100
A poisoned arrow?

6962
05:37:11,100 --> 05:37:15,620
Your life will decrease with each passing minute, so cure the poison as soon as possible.

6963
05:37:16,440 --> 05:37:21,720
To cure poison, go into cure in the survival viewer and inject yourself with a dose of serum.

6964
05:37:21,920 --> 05:37:23,420
I don't need like a tutorial.

6965
05:37:24,000 --> 05:37:25,600
Kodak, where's the good stuff?

6966
05:37:29,040 --> 05:37:30,400
Sokolov is inside the lab.

6967
05:37:30,580 --> 05:37:33,160
Look for a way in and use it to infiltrate the lab.

6968
05:37:34,720 --> 05:37:35,500
That's it?

6969
05:37:35,600 --> 05:37:36,900
Come on, you guys.

6970
05:37:37,840 --> 05:37:40,920
I thought there was supposed to be like infinite words.

6971
05:37:43,400 --> 05:37:45,300
Clearly this game doesn't want me to eat.

6972
05:37:48,040 --> 05:37:49,320
Thank you for the gift.

6973
05:37:49,480 --> 05:37:50,420
Thank you for the life gift.

6974
05:37:50,900 --> 05:37:51,800
Oh my god.

6975
05:37:54,060 --> 05:37:55,160
Is your name A?

6976
05:37:56,980 --> 05:37:57,460
A?

6977
05:37:57,720 --> 05:37:58,400
I can't tell.

6978
05:38:00,360 --> 05:38:01,000
Thank you.

6979
05:38:12,880 --> 05:38:15,000
Uh oh, I hear a snake hissing at me.

6980
05:38:16,200 --> 05:38:17,040
Stop hissing at me.

6981
05:38:18,480 --> 05:38:19,040
I'm leaving.

6982
05:38:19,220 --> 05:38:19,580
Oh my god.

6983
05:38:21,820 --> 05:38:22,980
Snake is gonna get me killed.

6984
05:38:31,290 --> 05:38:32,670
My stomach's gonna get me killed.

6985
05:38:37,510 --> 05:38:39,790
These guys have been leeched of good topics.

6986
05:38:39,890 --> 05:38:40,790
Wait, do I still have a leech?

6987
05:38:47,290 --> 05:38:48,190
Oopsie.

6988
05:38:51,140 --> 05:38:52,550
What if I wanted him there?

6989
05:38:53,470 --> 05:38:54,010
I

6990
05:38:58,060 --> 05:38:58,780
wanted him there.

6991
05:39:06,020 --> 05:39:07,340
Maroon shark.

6992
05:39:15,020 --> 05:39:16,820
So funny.

6993
05:39:22,400 --> 05:39:23,760
So, so funny.

6994
05:39:23,960 --> 05:39:24,840
This is a friend.

6995
05:39:34,660 --> 05:39:37,660
Oh yeah, there is this little hole right here, isn't there?

6996
05:39:40,040 --> 05:39:41,300
Maybe I'll go in through here.

6997
05:39:44,400 --> 05:39:46,020
We did the door last time.

6998
05:39:48,880 --> 05:39:49,740
Whatcha munchin' on?

6999
05:39:49,840 --> 05:39:50,240
Pizza.

7000
05:39:51,520 --> 05:39:54,480
There's definitely not a crawling entrance in the grass on this side of the complex.

7001
05:39:54,480 --> 05:39:56,080
No, I knew this one.

7002
05:39:56,340 --> 05:39:57,200
I knew it.

7003
05:39:59,440 --> 05:40:00,240
Last time.

7004
05:40:00,380 --> 05:40:03,900
Yeah, my save corrupted and I had to, you know...

7005
05:40:09,790 --> 05:40:11,410
I almost forgot, but I didn't.

7006
05:40:15,930 --> 05:40:16,410
Hello?

7007
05:40:27,870 --> 05:40:29,450
How did he not notice that?

7008
05:40:31,210 --> 05:40:33,050
How did he not notice that?

7009
05:40:37,800 --> 05:40:41,400
But going through the door is kind of fun because you get the little guy who's just like...

7010
05:40:41,940 --> 05:40:42,700
Who's knocking?

7011
05:40:44,100 --> 05:40:45,200
It's fun, you know?

7012
05:41:02,320 --> 05:41:03,520
I had it!

7013
05:41:04,400 --> 05:41:04,860
Pressure.

7014
05:41:06,580 --> 05:41:07,040
Please.

7015
05:41:08,440 --> 05:41:09,780
Please, I have you.

7016
05:41:11,340 --> 05:41:13,040
Just take the shot!

7017
05:41:14,620 --> 05:41:15,020
Snake!

7018
05:41:15,720 --> 05:41:16,500
Oh my gosh.

7019
05:41:17,740 --> 05:41:18,860
Take the shot!

7020
05:41:24,480 --> 05:41:25,120
Golly!

7021
05:41:29,390 --> 05:41:31,090
I think there's one...

7022
05:41:38,940 --> 05:41:39,580
Maybe?

7023
05:41:55,480 --> 05:41:56,280
There we go.

7024
05:41:57,540 --> 05:41:59,000
No, I can't do it.

7025
05:42:00,180 --> 05:42:04,160
You guys don't realize how often I quote Metal Gear stuff.

7026
05:42:05,300 --> 05:42:08,120
And how often I quote that in the game.

7027
05:42:08,140 --> 05:42:08,340
In particular.

7028
05:42:08,680 --> 05:42:09,300
I'll just be like...

7029
05:42:09,300 --> 05:42:10,180
No, I can't do it.

7030
05:42:10,680 --> 05:42:11,560
Oh, that's right!

7031
05:42:11,680 --> 05:42:12,780
And we can blow this one up too.

7032
05:42:17,260 --> 05:42:17,660
TNT!

7033
05:42:19,440 --> 05:42:20,480
What is this?

7034
05:42:20,900 --> 05:42:21,820
Wait, what is this?

7035
05:42:23,000 --> 05:42:23,580
What is it?

7036
05:42:23,700 --> 05:42:24,420
What is this?

7037
05:42:30,610 --> 05:42:32,230
But going inside the building...

7038
05:42:32,910 --> 05:42:33,970
Does it lead to...

7039
05:42:33,970 --> 05:42:34,750
Maybe it does.

7040
05:42:41,420 --> 05:42:42,740
Oh, M16 prototype.

7041
05:42:43,620 --> 05:42:44,020
Oh...

7042
05:42:52,060 --> 05:42:53,960
I know I need to go in through that door.

7043
05:42:55,260 --> 05:42:56,100
I'm just...

7044
05:42:56,100 --> 05:42:56,960
Perusing.

7045
05:42:58,080 --> 05:42:58,640
You know?

7046
05:42:59,780 --> 05:43:02,200
I'm taking a little gander around the area.

7047
05:43:04,200 --> 05:43:05,020
Is this one...

7048
05:43:05,020 --> 05:43:06,240
Oh, we'll take that.

7049
05:43:07,580 --> 05:43:08,220
Just kidding.

7050
05:43:08,380 --> 05:43:08,940
I'm full.

7051
05:43:11,640 --> 05:43:13,540
See guys, I always have too many bullets.

7052
05:43:13,640 --> 05:43:14,460
I just don't...

7053
05:43:14,460 --> 05:43:15,200
I just don't...

7054
05:43:15,920 --> 05:43:16,660
I'm too...

7055
05:43:16,660 --> 05:43:18,400
I'm too passive at this game.

7056
05:43:18,560 --> 05:43:18,800
I'm too passive at this game.

7057
05:43:21,220 --> 05:43:23,820
Actually, isn't there a way down here as well?

7058
05:43:24,000 --> 05:43:24,720
Or am I crazy?

7059
05:43:40,160 --> 05:43:40,600
Claymore.

7060
05:43:48,620 --> 05:43:49,360
Time to...

7061
05:43:49,360 --> 05:43:49,760
Oh no!

7062
05:43:49,960 --> 05:43:51,260
I forgot the TNT.

7063
05:43:55,050 --> 05:43:56,290
I forgot the TNT.

7064
05:44:01,320 --> 05:44:02,600
Should I go back and do it?

7065
05:44:04,520 --> 05:44:05,420
Should I go back?

7066
05:44:08,780 --> 05:44:09,700
I'm gonna go do it.

7067
05:44:11,300 --> 05:44:12,220
I'm gonna go do it.

7068
05:44:12,940 --> 05:44:13,780
I'm gonna go...

7069
05:44:13,780 --> 05:44:15,200
Wait, what if it's still there.

7070
05:44:17,360 --> 05:44:18,140
What if it's...

7071
05:44:18,140 --> 05:44:19,300
What if it's still there?

7072
05:44:23,780 --> 05:44:24,380
What is it?

7073
05:44:26,480 --> 05:44:27,040
Damn it.

7074
05:44:34,630 --> 05:44:36,090
These guys only have two.

7075
05:44:38,570 --> 05:44:40,790
I think I can do it in time, but you know...

7076
05:44:40,790 --> 05:44:41,390
I'm just a...

7077
05:44:41,870 --> 05:44:44,130
Just for safe measure.

7078
05:45:00,060 --> 05:45:00,460
I'm一樣.

7079
05:45:00,460 --> 05:45:01,840
Do, do, do...

7080
05:45:04,940 --> 05:45:05,380
TNT.

7081
05:45:07,820 --> 05:45:08,260
Okay.

7082
05:45:17,520 --> 05:45:19,300
I'm gonna blow it up.

7083
05:45:19,440 --> 05:45:20,400
I'm gonna blow it up.

7084
05:45:20,520 --> 05:45:21,480
I'm gonna blow it up.

7085
05:45:22,920 --> 05:45:24,460
I'm gonna blow it all to hell.

7086
05:45:25,020 --> 05:45:26,880
I'm gonna blow it all to hell!

7087
05:45:27,740 --> 05:45:28,960
Where's the orange entrance?

7088
05:45:30,280 --> 05:45:32,220
I'm gonna blow it all to hell!

7089
05:45:34,720 --> 05:45:35,280
Okay.

7090
05:45:42,480 --> 05:45:43,040
Negotiate.

7091
05:45:54,440 --> 05:45:56,520
This feels so familiar, doesn't it?

7092
05:45:56,840 --> 05:45:57,620
Wait a second.

7093
05:45:58,920 --> 05:46:02,080
This is the... this is like the one that's Kabuki style, isn't it?

7094
05:46:10,000 --> 05:46:11,800
Kabuki's female role face paint.

7095
05:46:12,120 --> 05:46:15,320
What if I look like that with my, um...

7096
05:46:17,620 --> 05:46:20,520
With my... scientist outfit on?

7097
05:46:23,580 --> 05:46:24,580
Call Sigint?

7098
05:46:24,640 --> 05:46:25,760
Oh yeah, let's see what he says.

7099
05:46:26,320 --> 05:46:27,320
Sigint, look at this.

7100
05:46:29,440 --> 05:46:30,240
I'm beautiful.

7101
05:46:30,620 --> 05:46:31,120
It's called Oyama.

7102
05:46:31,760 --> 05:46:32,320
Oyama?

7103
05:46:32,680 --> 05:46:33,240
Yeah.

7104
05:46:33,520 --> 05:46:36,280
It's the name of an androgynous Japanese deity.

7105
05:46:36,760 --> 05:46:37,720
Are you serious?

7106
05:46:38,180 --> 05:46:39,080
Are you serious?

7107
05:46:39,440 --> 05:46:40,080
From who?

7108
05:46:40,620 --> 05:46:41,080
Paramedic.

7109
05:46:41,440 --> 05:46:42,140
Never mind.

7110
05:46:42,300 --> 05:46:43,600
Oh my gosh, thank you for the 50!

7111
05:46:43,900 --> 05:46:45,720
In any case, that face paint doesn't seem to work very well.

7112
05:46:45,860 --> 05:46:47,480
Your camo index is way down.

7113
05:46:48,120 --> 05:46:51,100
Unless you want the enemy to see you, I'd change to something else.

7114
05:46:51,440 --> 05:46:51,760
Oh.

7115
05:46:52,860 --> 05:46:53,320
Okay.

7116
05:46:53,960 --> 05:46:54,840
Let me guess.

7117
05:46:55,020 --> 05:46:56,420
You were just getting to like it.

7118
05:46:56,780 --> 05:46:58,180
It kinda grew on me.

7119
05:46:58,840 --> 05:46:59,300
Fine.

7120
05:46:59,420 --> 05:47:00,340
Get yourself shot.

7121
05:47:04,130 --> 05:47:05,390
He likes it.

7122
05:47:06,890 --> 05:47:07,930
He likes it.

7123
05:47:15,600 --> 05:47:17,400
Alright guys, time to be a scientist.

7124
05:47:20,940 --> 05:47:22,320
But also to like...

7125
05:47:22,320 --> 05:47:25,160
Okay, if I take down the other scientist...

7126
05:47:27,400 --> 05:47:27,840
What?

7127
05:47:28,420 --> 05:47:29,220
What do you mean, huh?

7128
05:47:30,100 --> 05:47:30,540
What?

7129
05:47:31,020 --> 05:47:31,460
What?

7130
05:47:34,720 --> 05:47:36,420
All I did was crawl out!

7131
05:47:41,820 --> 05:47:42,840
Is it the face paint?

7132
05:47:47,840 --> 05:47:48,240
Oh.

7133
05:47:57,620 --> 05:47:58,500
I'm a scientist!

7134
05:48:00,040 --> 05:48:01,580
With splitter face paint!

7135
05:48:01,840 --> 05:48:02,660
Oh my gosh.

7136
05:48:05,700 --> 05:48:06,700
Oh my god, the rat.

7137
05:48:09,260 --> 05:48:10,000
Is he coming out?

7138
05:48:11,120 --> 05:48:11,840
Look at this rat!

7139
05:48:12,120 --> 05:48:13,000
He wants to talk to me!

7140
05:48:14,480 --> 05:48:15,160
Okay, never mind.

7141
05:48:17,080 --> 05:48:18,600
Hold on, I must...

7142
05:48:20,940 --> 05:48:23,240
Wait, let me get rid of the face paint.

7143
05:48:26,680 --> 05:48:27,280
Oh.

7144
05:48:28,840 --> 05:48:29,440
Ah!

7145
05:48:34,360 --> 05:48:35,920
Oh my gosh, look how...

7146
05:48:35,920 --> 05:48:36,340
Ah!

7147
05:48:42,560 --> 05:48:43,160
Glasses!

7148
05:48:45,580 --> 05:48:47,160
What a hands...

7149
05:48:47,160 --> 05:48:48,140
He looks so good!

7150
05:48:50,840 --> 05:48:53,680
I'm not even a glasses person that much, but man...

7151
05:48:55,360 --> 05:48:56,560
He looks...

7152
05:48:58,620 --> 05:49:00,900
He looks too good in the glasses!

7153
05:49:01,600 --> 05:49:03,160
He looks so good.

7154
05:49:05,840 --> 05:49:08,300
Oh my god, he's got his own name tag too.

7155
05:49:08,400 --> 05:49:09,320
I know, it's so cute.

7156
05:49:11,640 --> 05:49:12,040
Oh.

7157
05:49:12,940 --> 05:49:13,340
Hi.

7158
05:49:22,430 --> 05:49:22,830
Right.

7159
05:49:25,790 --> 05:49:27,890
Why are you staring out the window, you freak?

7160
05:49:32,910 --> 05:49:33,810
Do your job!

7161
05:49:33,890 --> 05:49:34,430
Do your work!

7162
05:49:38,840 --> 05:49:40,760
I see you're disguised as a scientist.

7163
05:49:41,020 --> 05:49:42,120
It suits you rather nicely.

7164
05:49:42,240 --> 05:49:43,020
Yeah, I know.

7165
05:49:43,220 --> 05:49:46,120
As long as you don't do anything suspicious like roll or crawl...

7166
05:49:46,120 --> 05:49:46,580
I definitely crawled.

7167
05:49:46,580 --> 05:49:48,380
...the enemy should have no reason to suspect you.

7168
05:49:48,440 --> 05:49:49,160
I definitely crawled.

7169
05:49:49,680 --> 05:49:51,680
Sokolov is somewhere inside that lab.

7170
05:49:51,780 --> 05:49:51,900
Okay.

7171
05:49:52,080 --> 05:49:54,340
Find out where he is and make contact with him.

7172
05:49:55,180 --> 05:49:59,100
If you want to know where Sokolov is, why don't you ask one of the people around there?

7173
05:50:00,020 --> 05:50:01,120
Wait, how do you a...

7174
05:50:01,120 --> 05:50:03,660
Oh, like, do I hold them up with a knife?

7175
05:50:03,760 --> 05:50:05,080
I don't think they'd like that, though.

7176
05:50:06,720 --> 05:50:09,100
Some types of food spoil faster than others.

7177
05:50:09,960 --> 05:50:15,580
Animal and fish meat goes bad relatively fast, but plants and mushrooms generally last a little longer.

7178
05:50:16,440 --> 05:50:19,020
Animals won't go bad if you capture them alive, though.

7179
05:50:19,800 --> 05:50:24,480
You can tell whether food has gone bad or not by looking closely at the icon on the food screen.

7180
05:50:24,560 --> 05:50:25,500
Instead of, you must be Ames.

7181
05:50:25,620 --> 05:50:26,620
Where is Sokolov?

7182
05:50:26,720 --> 05:50:26,820
Where is Sokolov?

7183
05:50:26,820 --> 05:50:29,200
So be sure to check the icon before you eat the food.

7184
05:50:30,560 --> 05:50:31,440
Thanks, paramedic!

7185
05:50:32,800 --> 05:50:36,480
I'm afraid to save, you guys.

7186
05:50:36,540 --> 05:50:39,420
I'm so afraid to save every... I'm so afraid to save.

7187
05:50:41,680 --> 05:50:44,000
Wondering if I should, like, save and then...

7188
05:50:46,380 --> 05:50:49,860
I have another memory card, I just have to find it.

7189
05:50:53,160 --> 05:50:54,600
Just reuse 1, 2, 3.

7190
05:50:55,740 --> 05:50:56,600
You wanna save?

7191
05:50:57,020 --> 05:50:57,860
Hold on a sec.

7192
05:50:58,060 --> 05:50:59,240
Yeah, I might have to save frequently.

7193
05:50:59,540 --> 05:51:02,660
It's gonna interrupt my score, but it's not my fault!

7194
05:51:04,420 --> 05:51:06,540
It's... or my... what's it called, you know?

7195
05:51:06,680 --> 05:51:07,720
It's not my fault, though!

7196
05:51:09,000 --> 05:51:10,680
I just... I have to do...

7197
05:51:12,380 --> 05:51:13,580
I have to do it.

7198
05:51:15,580 --> 05:51:15,900
Okay.

7199
05:51:18,160 --> 05:51:20,840
Okay, I think I'm... I think I'm gonna...

7200
05:51:20,840 --> 05:51:21,200
Okay.

7201
05:51:21,380 --> 05:51:24,540
I think I might actually... stop here.

7202
05:51:24,660 --> 05:51:24,960
Oh no!

7203
05:51:25,080 --> 05:51:26,000
I wanted to get to the...

7204
05:51:27,500 --> 05:51:27,980
Okay.

7205
05:51:38,160 --> 05:51:39,960
I have to find it.

7206
05:51:42,500 --> 05:51:44,660
Why is it... why is every...

7207
05:51:44,660 --> 05:51:46,900
Why is every Metal Gear...

7208
05:51:47,580 --> 05:51:49,400
...MGS3 stream ending so cursed?

7209
05:51:54,200 --> 05:51:56,600
Actually, what if I, like, unplug it and plug it back in?

7210
05:52:00,900 --> 05:52:01,260
No.

7211
05:52:01,260 --> 05:52:01,620
No.

7212
05:52:01,700 --> 05:52:02,160
I'm scared.

7213
05:52:02,320 --> 05:52:03,700
I'm just gonna go find the other one.

7214
05:52:03,820 --> 05:52:04,380
I don't know.

7215
05:52:04,840 --> 05:52:07,500
I don't know, because I don't wanna take up all my save slots.

7216
05:52:13,380 --> 05:52:16,160
You thought it was Liquid who was your biggest fan, but it was always me!

7217
05:52:16,860 --> 05:52:17,220
Seroto.

7218
05:52:18,240 --> 05:52:20,000
I live on through these sunglasses.

7219
05:52:20,000 --> 05:52:20,980
Like them?

7220
05:52:22,700 --> 05:52:23,460
You did...

7221
05:52:23,460 --> 05:52:25,140
No, I didn't blow on it!

7222
05:52:26,080 --> 05:52:27,440
I didn't blow on it.

7223
05:52:34,780 --> 05:52:35,880
Try overwriting four.

7224
05:52:40,150 --> 05:52:42,190
Best bet would be another card in the slot, too.

7225
05:52:42,370 --> 05:52:42,750
Yeah.

7226
05:52:44,410 --> 05:52:45,130
I will do.

7227
05:52:49,430 --> 05:52:52,190
I would go look for it now, I just don't know where it is, so...

7228
05:52:53,810 --> 05:52:55,590
I don't know how long it would take me.

7229
05:52:57,030 --> 05:52:58,670
I have to... I have some...

7230
05:52:58,670 --> 05:53:01,630
I have, like, five drawers I need to search through.

7231
05:53:05,150 --> 05:53:05,590
Man...

7232
05:53:12,680 --> 05:53:16,340
It's so annoying because it, like, says it saves, but it doesn't.

7233
05:53:16,480 --> 05:53:18,220
And so that's what I'm scared of the most.

7234
05:53:18,300 --> 05:53:23,440
Right now, one and three are our only working save slots.

7235
05:53:24,000 --> 05:53:25,260
Which scares me a lot.

7236
05:53:25,260 --> 05:53:25,800
You know?

7237
05:53:27,600 --> 05:53:28,000
So...

7238
05:53:30,400 --> 05:53:31,920
I could try three.

7239
05:53:32,020 --> 05:53:32,780
Let me try three.

7240
05:53:32,920 --> 05:53:34,260
If it saves, I'll keep going.

7241
05:53:34,380 --> 05:53:35,440
And if not, then I'll...

7242
05:53:36,360 --> 05:53:36,840
Let's see.

7243
05:53:42,280 --> 05:53:42,680
Okay.

7244
05:53:51,880 --> 05:53:52,740
Alright, let's keep going.

7245
05:53:52,840 --> 05:53:54,820
Snake, have you ever seen the War of the Worlds?

7246
05:53:55,880 --> 05:53:56,280
No.

7247
05:53:56,920 --> 05:53:59,880
These flying saucers from Mars arrive on Earth this morning.

7248
05:53:59,880 --> 05:54:00,800
The sky is as meteorites.

7249
05:54:00,980 --> 05:54:04,020
The saucers use their heat rays to attack the nearby towns.

7250
05:54:05,240 --> 05:54:06,200
And then...

7251
05:54:06,200 --> 05:54:06,600
And then?

7252
05:54:07,480 --> 05:54:07,960
Um...

7253
05:54:07,960 --> 05:54:08,300
Yeah?

7254
05:54:08,980 --> 05:54:09,780
Something wrong?

7255
05:54:10,480 --> 05:54:13,120
Uh, the thing is, I was too scared to watch.

7256
05:54:13,340 --> 05:54:15,260
I had my eyes shut almost the whole time.

7257
05:54:15,740 --> 05:54:17,040
Then you haven't seen it.

7258
05:54:17,460 --> 05:54:18,660
No, it's not that.

7259
05:54:18,980 --> 05:54:19,360
It's...

7260
05:54:19,360 --> 05:54:20,320
Just use one and three.

7261
05:54:20,400 --> 05:54:21,940
We're losing a lot of slots.

7262
05:54:22,340 --> 05:54:23,440
You haven't seen that, have you?

7263
05:54:23,440 --> 05:54:24,180
We're losing slots.

7264
05:54:24,580 --> 05:54:26,080
That does remind me, though.

7265
05:54:26,380 --> 05:54:30,800
When I was two years old, my father listened to the radio drama, and he said, I'm a version of the story.

7266
05:54:31,160 --> 05:54:35,320
It was right after dinner on Sunday, and we were relaxing in the living room.

7267
05:54:36,060 --> 05:54:39,380
They said monsters had come out of a meteorite that landed in New Jersey.

7268
05:54:39,460 --> 05:54:39,920
Oh my god.

7269
05:54:40,080 --> 05:54:41,760
What if you were in New Jersey?

7270
05:54:41,800 --> 05:54:43,400
You would obviously know that it's fake.

7271
05:54:43,460 --> 05:54:46,300
My father said he and my older brother actually believed it and started yelling and panting.

7272
05:54:46,300 --> 05:54:47,520
You would be like, what meteorite?

7273
05:54:47,720 --> 05:54:49,260
Where did a meteorite land?

7274
05:54:49,300 --> 05:54:52,900
My mother supposedly grabbed me from my crib and took me out to the car, still wrapped up in blankets.

7275
05:54:53,920 --> 05:54:55,720
But then, just as my dad was about to start the car...

7276
05:54:55,720 --> 05:54:56,680
But everyone else would be like, ah!

7277
05:54:57,360 --> 05:54:59,720
And everyone in New Jersey would be like, what are you guys freaking out about?

7278
05:54:59,720 --> 05:55:02,780
Because on the car's radio, they were playing Bing Crosby tunes.

7279
05:55:03,640 --> 05:55:07,660
No matter what station he turned to, no one else seemed to be reporting on this big history.

7280
05:55:07,660 --> 05:55:09,680
So many people, I know a lot of people fell for it.

7281
05:55:09,760 --> 05:55:10,760
Sounds like something out of a big broadcast.

7282
05:55:10,760 --> 05:55:12,500
Have you guys heard of that one, like...

7283
05:55:12,500 --> 05:55:13,580
Nobody said a word.

7284
05:55:13,780 --> 05:55:15,920
It was like some program in...

7285
05:55:15,920 --> 05:55:20,480
My father and brother got off with a scolding from my mother, but I was the one who really suffered.

7286
05:55:20,720 --> 05:55:21,640
In the UK, I think?

7287
05:55:21,660 --> 05:55:27,020
After that incident, every time I acted up, my father and brother would scare me by saying, the Martians are coming!

7288
05:55:27,700 --> 05:55:28,460
That's terrible.

7289
05:55:29,240 --> 05:55:29,640
Isn't it?

7290
05:55:29,720 --> 05:55:29,860
Isn't it, though?

7291
05:55:30,540 --> 05:55:32,340
But it was like a ghost program.

7292
05:55:33,320 --> 05:55:34,860
I... I saw it.

7293
05:55:34,940 --> 05:55:36,740
But they played it off as like a...

7294
05:55:36,740 --> 05:55:39,220
So even nuclear weapons wouldn't work against the Martian war machines.

7295
05:55:39,280 --> 05:55:41,840
As like a real segment, like a real news thing.

7296
05:55:42,020 --> 05:55:46,140
Snake, if you conceal yourself like the Martians did, the enemy won't know what hit them.

7297
05:55:46,340 --> 05:55:47,540
I concealed myself.

7298
05:55:48,320 --> 05:55:49,120
Ghostwatch Live!

7299
05:55:49,200 --> 05:55:52,900
Maybe not immediately, but if you can hide yourself inside something a little more close at hand.

7300
05:55:53,120 --> 05:55:54,900
It's actually really interesting to watch, too.

7301
05:55:55,120 --> 05:55:56,540
Because they started like...

7302
05:55:56,540 --> 05:55:57,520
Something like...

7303
05:55:57,520 --> 05:55:58,280
A box!

7304
05:55:58,280 --> 05:55:58,500
A box!

7305
05:55:58,880 --> 05:56:00,380
Ah, I get it.

7306
05:56:01,100 --> 05:56:01,560
So...

7307
05:56:02,150 --> 05:56:03,260
You never saw the movie.

7308
05:56:03,500 --> 05:56:04,500
Sorry, I'm talking...

7309
05:56:04,500 --> 05:56:05,140
I saw it, alright?

7310
05:56:05,580 --> 05:56:07,160
I saw it, alright?

7311
05:56:07,880 --> 05:56:08,340
But...

7312
05:56:10,440 --> 05:56:12,120
Sorry, I was talking all over that...

7313
05:56:13,100 --> 05:56:14,020
That codec.

7314
05:56:14,060 --> 05:56:14,500
But...

7315
05:56:15,980 --> 05:56:16,440
Yeah.

7316
05:56:17,020 --> 05:56:23,820
It's really interesting because like they played it off as like a normal kind of like live news documentary style thing.

7317
05:56:24,020 --> 05:56:27,620
And then like they started having creepy stuff happen in the studio as well.

7318
05:56:27,620 --> 05:56:28,340
And so people...

7319
05:56:28,340 --> 05:56:32,720
People trusted these like actual news act...

7320
05:56:32,720 --> 05:56:33,940
Not actors...

7321
05:56:33,940 --> 05:56:34,820
Anchors and stuff.

7322
05:56:35,160 --> 05:56:35,720
And...

7323
05:56:35,720 --> 05:56:36,460
So...

7324
05:56:36,460 --> 05:56:37,160
Then...

7325
05:56:37,160 --> 05:56:39,960
Like people were getting really, really freaked out about it.

7326
05:56:40,000 --> 05:56:40,320
It was...

7327
05:56:40,920 --> 05:56:41,480
It's...

7328
05:56:41,480 --> 05:56:42,620
So interesting.

7329
05:56:43,600 --> 05:56:45,340
La la la la la la la.

7330
05:56:45,340 --> 05:56:46,060
La la la.

7331
05:56:46,120 --> 05:56:47,220
My name is...

7332
05:56:48,280 --> 05:56:48,840
Snake.

7333
05:56:49,100 --> 05:56:50,040
And I'm...

7334
05:56:57,370 --> 05:56:58,310
Oh my god.

7335
05:56:58,590 --> 05:56:59,330
Carrot time!

7336
05:56:59,690 --> 05:57:00,490
Wait, where is he?

7337
05:57:02,630 --> 05:57:03,910
I'm a scientist.

7338
05:57:04,770 --> 05:57:06,870
I'm a scientist and I eat in...

7339
05:57:06,870 --> 05:57:07,950
In the slammer.

7340
05:57:07,990 --> 05:57:08,470
Oh wait.

7341
05:57:10,090 --> 05:57:10,710
Hello?

7342
05:57:21,160 --> 05:57:23,240
Sir, would you like a maroon shark?

7343
05:57:31,280 --> 05:57:31,900
Yummy.

7344
05:57:33,290 --> 05:57:34,400
I love looking at...

7345
05:57:34,400 --> 05:57:35,980
Haruna Yabuki.

7346
05:57:37,340 --> 05:57:38,140
You know?

7347
05:57:39,480 --> 05:57:40,980
Where is Sokolov again?

7348
05:57:41,080 --> 05:57:41,600
I don't remember.

7349
05:57:53,700 --> 05:57:54,320
Sokolov?

7350
05:57:56,500 --> 05:57:57,420
Sokolov, where are you?

7351
05:57:59,040 --> 05:58:00,180
Get the carrot time.

7352
05:58:00,240 --> 05:58:02,220
I haven't been getting him this entire time.

7353
05:58:02,320 --> 05:58:03,280
I'm not gonna start right now.

7354
05:58:04,500 --> 05:58:05,800
Wait, can I go under this bed?

7355
05:58:08,120 --> 05:58:08,780
What's in there?

7356
05:58:12,290 --> 05:58:12,690
Oh.

7357
05:58:14,130 --> 05:58:14,950
Wait a second.

7358
05:58:15,010 --> 05:58:16,110
I never knew this was here.

7359
05:58:17,750 --> 05:58:18,710
Oh my god.

7360
05:58:20,770 --> 05:58:21,170
Whoa!

7361
05:58:26,940 --> 05:58:31,780
The radio casters that did that were probably the first people to make an analog horror series without knowing it.

7362
05:58:31,800 --> 05:58:32,360
True though.

7363
05:58:40,220 --> 05:58:41,720
I'm in this jail cell.

7364
05:58:42,280 --> 05:58:43,500
Get me out, sir.

7365
05:58:55,920 --> 05:58:57,140
Oh my gosh.

7366
05:58:57,600 --> 05:58:58,440
What's in there?

7367
05:59:01,420 --> 05:59:03,300
Why does that guy not recognize me?

7368
05:59:04,020 --> 05:59:05,540
You don't know scientists?

7369
05:59:05,900 --> 05:59:06,780
You're not a scientist?

7370
05:59:07,340 --> 05:59:08,460
Why do you go...

7371
05:59:08,460 --> 05:59:08,520
Huh?

7372
05:59:11,680 --> 05:59:12,240
Okay.

7373
05:59:12,320 --> 05:59:12,840
Well.

7374
05:59:15,240 --> 05:59:17,460
Our coat's gonna be filthy after this trip.

7375
05:59:17,460 --> 05:59:17,540
True.

7376
05:59:22,040 --> 05:59:25,180
I believe there are a lot of people that get fooled by analog horror.

7377
05:59:25,560 --> 05:59:38,000
I mean, that's like a popular thing on TikTok actually is like, you know, because it's so easy to just make like a quick little something something and have it seem kind of like a realistic horror story.

7378
05:59:39,640 --> 05:59:42,820
And people actually do that quite often.

7379
05:59:42,900 --> 05:59:43,900
I like to watch them.

7380
05:59:44,680 --> 05:59:46,700
But sometimes they seem like quite realistic.

7381
05:59:46,700 --> 05:59:47,280
Right?

7382
05:59:47,800 --> 05:59:55,100
Like they seem like, Oh, this is this could be an actual horror something.

7383
05:59:55,480 --> 05:59:56,220
Oh my gosh.

7384
05:59:58,840 --> 05:59:59,320
Ouch.

7385
06:00:00,380 --> 06:00:01,220
Oh my God.

7386
06:00:01,260 --> 06:00:03,960
Why do you have poisonous insects in your location?

7387
06:00:09,700 --> 06:00:10,180
Oh.

7388
06:00:21,820 --> 06:00:22,680
Wait, is it?

7389
06:00:22,740 --> 06:00:23,180
It's.

7390
06:00:26,560 --> 06:00:27,460
Let's see through here.

7391
06:00:30,960 --> 06:00:33,080
Forgot he pushes up his glasses when you do that.

7392
06:00:33,840 --> 06:00:35,540
Wait, isn't it through here?

7393
06:00:40,150 --> 06:00:41,590
How do I get them to go through here?

7394
06:01:00,540 --> 06:01:02,660
I'm looking for Sokolov, but isn't he in there?

7395
06:01:08,440 --> 06:01:09,560
Am I crazy?

7396
06:01:14,530 --> 06:01:15,210
He's not?

7397
06:01:15,550 --> 06:01:19,050
I'm crazy?

7398
06:01:19,390 --> 06:01:20,430
Where was he at again?

7399
06:01:20,590 --> 06:01:21,090
I can't remember.

7400
06:01:22,570 --> 06:01:24,250
Gotta go around the long way.

7401
06:01:24,530 --> 06:01:24,830
No!

7402
06:01:29,920 --> 06:01:31,740
Yeah, I gotta... Sokolov?

7403
06:01:32,280 --> 06:01:32,760
Sokolov?

7404
06:01:34,100 --> 06:01:34,940
Sokolov, are you there?

7405
06:01:36,040 --> 06:01:36,520
Sokolov?

7406
06:01:39,120 --> 06:01:39,600
Sokolov?

7407
06:01:40,860 --> 06:01:41,660
Where are you?

7408
06:01:43,320 --> 06:01:44,080
Hello, sir.

7409
06:01:46,080 --> 06:01:47,220
Hello, I'm just a scientist.

7410
06:01:47,880 --> 06:01:48,880
Doing my work.

7411
06:01:49,240 --> 06:01:51,060
My very important research.

7412
06:01:54,990 --> 06:01:55,510
Yeah.

7413
06:01:56,490 --> 06:01:57,430
So important.

7414
06:01:57,750 --> 06:02:00,230
Really, really, really, really important research.

7415
06:02:00,530 --> 06:02:00,930
Okay?

7416
06:02:01,590 --> 06:02:02,770
Like, don't bother me.

7417
06:02:04,130 --> 06:02:06,010
And also, I'm hungry.

7418
06:02:08,790 --> 06:02:09,770
Oh, wait!

7419
06:02:09,950 --> 06:02:11,450
Oh my gosh, I could blow this up.

7420
06:02:11,930 --> 06:02:14,170
I could blow this up.

7421
06:02:15,970 --> 06:02:17,050
It would be great.

7422
06:02:33,060 --> 06:02:33,860
Do it.

7423
06:02:34,240 --> 06:02:35,880
I'll forget about it, I swear.

7424
06:02:36,540 --> 06:02:38,340
I'll set the TNT and then forget.

7425
06:02:39,000 --> 06:02:40,020
Just like before.

7426
06:02:41,100 --> 06:02:41,640
Hello.

7427
06:02:46,780 --> 06:02:48,200
I'm not being suspicious.

7428
06:02:50,100 --> 06:02:51,820
I'm being very normal and average.

7429
06:02:52,100 --> 06:02:53,260
Oh, and I'm hungry.

7430
06:02:59,660 --> 06:03:00,540
What is that?

7431
06:03:01,580 --> 06:03:02,460
What is...

7432
06:03:03,740 --> 06:03:05,300
Oh, I've never...

7433
06:03:05,300 --> 06:03:06,800
seen that before.

7434
06:03:07,520 --> 06:03:09,960
It's like my first time ever seeing a...

7435
06:03:09,960 --> 06:03:12,980
a poster in this game that's not half-naked women.

7436
06:03:13,760 --> 06:03:14,500
That's insane.

7437
06:03:15,240 --> 06:03:15,760
What?

7438
06:03:18,120 --> 06:03:18,880
What's it for?

7439
06:03:21,700 --> 06:03:23,180
Let's have an instant noodles.

7440
06:03:23,720 --> 06:03:24,560
Actually, let's...

7441
06:03:24,560 --> 06:03:25,480
Oh, articulated python.

7442
06:03:25,680 --> 06:03:25,940
Where...

7443
06:03:25,940 --> 06:03:26,760
How...

7444
06:03:26,760 --> 06:03:28,960
How long have I had this?

7445
06:03:29,460 --> 06:03:30,660
I want some more.

7446
06:03:30,900 --> 06:03:31,600
I want some more!

7447
06:03:35,300 --> 06:03:35,580
Wow!

7448
06:03:36,960 --> 06:03:38,160
What a rare find!

7449
06:03:43,070 --> 06:03:43,570
Okay.

7450
06:03:43,650 --> 06:03:46,190
I feel like opening this is going to be scary, so...

7451
06:03:47,030 --> 06:03:48,150
Wait, can I go through here?

7452
06:03:50,890 --> 06:03:52,330
Into the unknown!

7453
06:03:54,030 --> 06:03:54,530
Oh.

7454
06:03:55,870 --> 06:03:56,370
Okay.

7455
06:03:59,550 --> 06:04:00,410
Where are we?

7456
06:04:01,050 --> 06:04:02,550
This place is a true maze.

7457
06:04:05,930 --> 06:04:06,450
Ten.

7458
06:04:07,950 --> 06:04:08,810
Chocolate chip!

7459
06:04:13,440 --> 06:04:14,540
Into the unknown!

7460
06:04:17,320 --> 06:04:19,100
Imagine a guy walking through scientist...

7461
06:04:19,100 --> 06:04:21,460
Through a scientist eating a articulated python.

7462
06:04:23,300 --> 06:04:24,220
Chocolate chip!

7463
06:04:24,280 --> 06:04:24,820
Just like me!

7464
06:04:26,120 --> 06:04:26,980
A little bit.

7465
06:04:31,960 --> 06:04:33,560
This is where some scientists are.

7466
06:04:34,900 --> 06:04:35,700
Oh my god!

7467
06:04:35,740 --> 06:04:36,120
Never mind.

7468
06:04:36,160 --> 06:04:36,540
That's a bathroom.

7469
06:04:36,660 --> 06:04:36,900
Okay.

7470
06:04:36,920 --> 06:04:40,280
That guy was not...

7471
06:04:45,880 --> 06:04:47,000
I lied?

7472
06:04:48,080 --> 06:04:48,640
Oh

7473
06:04:55,860 --> 06:04:56,460
my gosh.

7474
06:04:57,260 --> 06:04:58,060
Keto time.

7475
06:05:09,700 --> 06:05:13,180
I don't want to get caught by this bozo right here, you know?

7476
06:05:17,580 --> 06:05:18,400
Oh my gosh.

7477
06:05:23,240 --> 06:05:24,380
Do I go through here?

7478
06:05:25,000 --> 06:05:25,820
Oh my gosh.

7479
06:05:25,940 --> 06:05:26,180
Hello.

7480
06:05:26,780 --> 06:05:27,520
Hello, sir.

7481
06:05:28,520 --> 06:05:29,080
Oh, hello.

7482
06:05:29,100 --> 06:05:31,240
I'm the reception scientist today.

7483
06:05:31,680 --> 06:05:32,540
That's my duty.

7484
06:05:33,060 --> 06:05:33,940
Don't mind me.

7485
06:05:34,400 --> 06:05:36,240
Just being a reception scientist.

7486
06:05:37,660 --> 06:05:40,400
I'm greeting all of our distinguished guests.

7487
06:05:42,260 --> 06:05:43,100
I'm gonna sneeze.

7488
06:05:49,880 --> 06:05:50,680
Oh my god.

7489
06:05:51,200 --> 06:05:53,780
I'm standing here because I'm gonna sneeze, officer.

7490
06:05:55,640 --> 06:05:56,920
At least I thought I was.

7491
06:05:57,540 --> 06:05:59,360
I lost the sneeze, officer.

7492
06:06:01,940 --> 06:06:03,340
I lost the sneeze.

7493
06:06:15,480 --> 06:06:15,880
Okay.

7494
06:06:23,960 --> 06:06:25,720
It's all stuffed up in my nose.

7495
06:06:26,000 --> 06:06:27,140
Before you say, what nose?

7496
06:06:27,440 --> 06:06:28,780
It's literally right there.

7497
06:06:28,820 --> 06:06:30,020
If you can't see it, you're blind.

7498
06:06:35,710 --> 06:06:36,110
Okay.

7499
06:06:36,150 --> 06:06:36,630
There we go.

7500
06:06:44,550 --> 06:06:45,190
Oh my gosh.

7501
06:06:45,210 --> 06:06:45,430
Shit.

7502
06:06:47,870 --> 06:06:49,290
I hate these scientists.

7503
06:06:49,770 --> 06:06:50,850
Maybe I'll knock them out.

7504
06:06:52,650 --> 06:06:53,350
Oh my god.

7505
06:06:53,390 --> 06:06:54,330
Don't walk towards me.

7506
06:07:00,680 --> 06:07:01,160
Sorry.

7507
06:07:02,760 --> 06:07:04,280
I have wide arms.

7508
06:07:06,600 --> 06:07:07,080
Okay.

7509
06:07:07,100 --> 06:07:07,380
Here we go.

7510
06:07:16,680 --> 06:07:17,160
Oh.

7511
06:07:17,340 --> 06:07:17,820
Oh.

7512
06:07:18,700 --> 06:07:19,540
Oh, shit.

7513
06:07:20,000 --> 06:07:20,480
No!

7514
06:07:32,120 --> 06:07:32,760
Oh, wait.

7515
06:07:32,840 --> 06:07:33,400
Do I have to...

7516
06:07:33,400 --> 06:07:33,700
Oh, hold on.

7517
06:07:38,080 --> 06:07:39,020
They'll never know.

7518
06:07:40,320 --> 06:07:41,220
They'll never know.

7519
06:07:41,560 --> 06:07:41,880
I

7520
06:07:46,890 --> 06:07:47,810
was really cool shoes.

7521
06:07:47,950 --> 06:07:48,250
I'm just...

7522
06:07:54,390 --> 06:07:55,510
Where are they shooting at?

7523
06:07:59,060 --> 06:07:59,760
Oh, my god!

7524
06:08:01,320 --> 06:08:03,300
Are you serious right now?

7525
06:08:07,890 --> 06:08:09,470
Oh, I have to not be in the disguise.

7526
06:08:09,690 --> 06:08:10,250
That's right.

7527
06:08:10,710 --> 06:08:11,750
I completely forgot.

7528
06:08:12,910 --> 06:08:14,030
I completely forgot.

7529
06:08:14,310 --> 06:08:15,230
Oh, shoot.

7530
06:08:16,170 --> 06:08:17,110
What are we gonna do?

7531
06:08:17,630 --> 06:08:19,090
How are we gonna get out of this mess?

7532
06:08:20,570 --> 06:08:22,230
How we get out of this mess?

7533
06:08:22,650 --> 06:08:22,970
Hmmm.

7534
06:08:23,210 --> 06:08:23,490
I'm not going to die.

7535
06:08:38,340 --> 06:08:39,560
Superchat was eaten by YouTube.

7536
06:08:39,740 --> 06:08:39,940
Oh no!

7537
06:08:42,420 --> 06:08:45,660
It denied intending to incite panic.

7538
06:08:47,900 --> 06:08:49,140
A funny cigarette?

7539
06:08:49,320 --> 06:08:51,160
No, I don't think... you get it...

7540
06:08:51,870 --> 06:08:57,120
Pretty sure you get that when you disguise yourself as that other guy.

7541
06:08:57,340 --> 06:08:57,860
What's his name?

7542
06:08:58,520 --> 06:08:59,020
Rykov.

7543
06:08:59,320 --> 06:09:02,480
I'm pretty sure that's when you go... when you get that thing.

7544
06:09:04,480 --> 06:09:06,980
Not that it matters what I'm wearing, but you know.

7545
06:09:18,600 --> 06:09:21,180
It's just a cardboard box in here!

7546
06:09:21,520 --> 06:09:22,260
Shit you.

7547
06:09:22,920 --> 06:09:23,680
Where are you?

7548
06:09:26,000 --> 06:09:26,640
Stop it!

7549
06:09:28,000 --> 06:09:30,920
I'm just a cardboard box in the corner of the room.

7550
06:09:31,300 --> 06:09:32,940
There's no reason you should know!

7551
06:09:34,100 --> 06:09:34,600
Okay?

7552
06:09:35,580 --> 06:09:39,940
Actually, since I'm here, and since you guys are down, we're gonna shut this door.

7553
06:09:40,620 --> 06:09:41,700
Actually, well, maybe not.

7554
06:09:41,880 --> 06:09:43,740
Okay, we're gonna just take you...

7555
06:09:44,360 --> 06:09:46,740
Wait, this is the right gun, right?

7556
06:09:48,600 --> 06:09:49,280
Yeah, okay.

7557
06:09:49,580 --> 06:09:51,340
We're just gonna... okay.

7558
06:09:51,440 --> 06:09:52,120
Don't wake up.

7559
06:09:52,860 --> 06:09:53,260
Okay?

7560
06:09:53,360 --> 06:09:54,460
And neither can you.

7561
06:09:54,780 --> 06:09:55,480
Don't wake up.

7562
06:09:55,560 --> 06:09:56,100
You're not allowed.

7563
06:09:58,340 --> 06:09:59,020
Here we go.

7564
06:09:59,920 --> 06:10:00,320
Yeah.

7565
06:10:02,100 --> 06:10:02,500
Ahem.

7566
06:10:03,620 --> 06:10:05,620
Sneak 100 something something.

7567
06:10:07,260 --> 06:10:07,620
Yeah.

7568
06:10:21,630 --> 06:10:23,330
This version is so great.

7569
06:10:24,230 --> 06:10:24,890
Ba-do-dang.

7570
06:10:27,090 --> 06:10:29,250
Ba-do-dang-dang.

7571
06:10:29,770 --> 06:10:34,220
Gotta turn it all the way up.

7572
06:10:35,660 --> 06:10:38,980
If you're looking for Sokolov, he's not here anymore.

7573
06:10:40,900 --> 06:10:41,620
Ugh!

7574
06:10:42,520 --> 06:10:44,380
Put that thing away.

7575
06:10:44,380 --> 06:10:46,180
You'll spoil my drink.

7576
06:10:48,120 --> 06:10:52,180
So, you're the intruder everyone's talking about.

7577
06:10:54,400 --> 06:10:56,160
Typical capitalist dog.

7578
06:10:56,520 --> 06:10:57,940
No manners.

7579
06:11:02,020 --> 06:11:06,730
You mean you've never heard of me?

7580
06:11:06,810 --> 06:11:08,770
And you call yourself an agent?

7581
06:11:08,770 --> 06:11:09,510
That photo on the wall.

7582
06:11:10,890 --> 06:11:12,090
That's insane.

7583
06:11:12,190 --> 06:11:12,950
Very well, then.

7584
06:11:14,650 --> 06:11:17,750
I am Aleksandr Leonovich Granin.

7585
06:11:18,390 --> 06:11:18,870
GRANIN!

7586
06:11:18,970 --> 06:11:21,330
A man of some importance, if I do say so myself.

7587
06:11:24,130 --> 06:11:27,190
I am the foremost weapon scientist in the Soviet Union.

7588
06:11:28,530 --> 06:11:31,590
And the head of the glorious Granin Design Bureau.

7589
06:11:33,350 --> 06:11:35,070
This is the Order of Lenin.

7590
06:11:36,250 --> 06:11:38,590
It is an honor of the greatest magnitude...

7591
06:11:38,590 --> 06:11:40,250
Sorry, I'm muting again so I can eat.

7592
06:11:40,250 --> 06:11:41,710
That's okay, we'll just watch the cutscene.

7593
06:11:41,770 --> 06:11:44,150
...the only and finest workers.

7594
06:11:45,450 --> 06:11:50,310
It was awarded to me in recognition of my brilliant contributions to society.

7595
06:11:53,010 --> 06:12:00,870
Since the Great Patriotic War, I have created countless weapons in the service of our great communist society.

7596
06:12:01,430 --> 06:12:02,590
Oh my god, Ray on the right!

7597
06:12:03,010 --> 06:12:08,290
It was thanks to me that we were able to stamp out the Nazi scum.

7598
06:12:08,290 --> 06:12:09,810
I never noticed the picture.

7599
06:12:09,950 --> 06:12:10,790
Maybe I just...

7600
06:12:10,790 --> 06:12:21,790
It was I who created the basic design for the mobile ballistic missile system you know and fear as SS1C.

7601
06:12:28,350 --> 06:12:30,250
The first time, why would you?

7602
06:12:30,290 --> 06:12:31,830
Yeah, I guess it's true.

7603
06:12:33,090 --> 06:12:35,310
But I've also watched, like, cutscenes of this.

7604
06:12:35,310 --> 06:12:36,050
I just never noticed it.

7605
06:12:36,050 --> 06:12:41,110
So, because of him, I've got nothing to do but sit here...

7606
06:12:41,110 --> 06:12:43,250
Maybe like a, you know, a half-watch.

7607
06:12:43,750 --> 06:12:45,450
...and drink this crap.

7608
06:12:46,610 --> 06:12:47,130
Him?

7609
06:12:49,530 --> 06:12:50,050
Sokolov!

7610
06:12:50,210 --> 06:12:50,730
Sokolov!

7611
06:12:52,590 --> 06:12:54,390
It's him you're looking for, isn't it?

7612
06:12:54,530 --> 06:12:54,930
Yeah.

7613
06:12:56,530 --> 06:12:59,470
Because of him, I have been stripped of my authority.

7614
06:12:59,790 --> 06:13:01,650
My research has come to nothing.

7615
06:13:02,570 --> 06:13:03,090
Look!

7616
06:13:06,320 --> 06:13:10,380
It is a revolutionary mobile nuclear missile system.

7617
06:13:10,460 --> 06:13:11,020
Oh my god.

7618
06:13:11,140 --> 06:13:12,100
A bipedal tank.

7619
06:13:12,480 --> 06:13:12,900
Uh, oh.

7620
06:13:13,060 --> 06:13:14,260
I don't think we want that.

7621
06:13:14,860 --> 06:13:15,460
Ah!

7622
06:13:17,020 --> 06:13:18,460
A bipedal tank?

7623
06:13:19,160 --> 06:13:20,600
I don't think we want that.

7624
06:13:21,060 --> 06:13:21,140
Yes.

7625
06:13:21,140 --> 06:13:21,940
A walking tank.

7626
06:13:22,180 --> 06:13:23,020
A robot.

7627
06:13:24,180 --> 06:13:24,780
Who?

7628
06:13:24,780 --> 06:13:25,840
Who's asking for this?

7629
06:13:25,840 --> 06:13:29,940
Are you familiar with the theory of the missing link between apes and humans?

7630
06:13:31,560 --> 06:13:33,140
Well, this technology...

7631
06:13:33,620 --> 06:13:33,960
Yahoo!

7632
06:13:33,960 --> 06:13:35,940
The missing link between infantry and artillery.

7633
06:13:36,240 --> 06:13:38,500
A kind of metal gear, if you will.

7634
06:13:39,060 --> 06:13:39,500
Whoa!

7635
06:13:39,880 --> 06:13:40,780
He said the thing!

7636
06:13:40,800 --> 06:13:44,700
And this magnificent metal gear will mark a revolutionary step forward in weapons development.

7637
06:13:45,300 --> 06:13:46,660
He said the thing!

7638
06:13:47,520 --> 06:13:47,640
Metal gear.

7639
06:13:50,900 --> 06:13:53,020
But I won't be used so easily.

7640
06:13:53,420 --> 06:13:53,860
No.

7641
06:13:54,120 --> 06:13:55,820
No crying myself to sleep.

7642
06:13:55,880 --> 06:13:57,000
Okay, I finally finished my piece of pizza.

7643
06:13:57,120 --> 06:13:57,880
You guys are safe.

7644
06:13:57,960 --> 06:14:00,640
For you see, I'm going to send these documents to my friend in the United States.

7645
06:14:00,640 --> 06:14:02,020
Oh my god, they show it so obviously.

7646
06:14:02,100 --> 06:14:02,820
That's so hilarious.

7647
06:14:03,080 --> 06:14:03,300
What?

7648
06:14:03,300 --> 06:14:04,280
Oh my god!

7649
06:14:04,560 --> 06:14:06,480
These bastards will live to regret this.

7650
06:14:06,500 --> 06:14:07,700
It's just Rex.

7651
06:14:07,820 --> 06:14:10,380
They may themselves become the targets of my creation.

7652
06:14:10,620 --> 06:14:13,000
They will know my true greatness.

7653
06:14:15,340 --> 06:14:15,860
Yes.

7654
06:14:15,860 --> 06:14:20,260
Sokolov's pathetic shagohan pales in comparison to my work.

7655
06:14:20,340 --> 06:14:21,060
I can't wait.

7656
06:14:21,220 --> 06:14:21,700
Oh my gosh.

7657
06:14:21,940 --> 06:14:24,780
What are you going to do with a rocket engine on a tank?

7658
06:14:25,120 --> 06:14:25,360
Yeah.

7659
06:14:25,580 --> 06:14:26,860
About Sokolov.

7660
06:14:27,640 --> 06:14:29,500
A tank does not need a rocket.

7661
06:14:30,240 --> 06:14:31,660
It needs something else.

7662
06:14:31,660 --> 06:14:33,400
It needs feet.

7663
06:14:33,400 --> 06:14:33,780
Look at these.

7664
06:14:35,400 --> 06:14:36,440
Nice shoes.

7665
06:14:38,760 --> 06:14:39,480
No.

7666
06:14:39,480 --> 06:14:40,200
Legs.

7667
06:14:40,640 --> 06:14:42,520
Legs that allow it to go anywhere.

7668
06:14:42,920 --> 06:14:45,660
Just as when humans learned to walk upright.

7669
06:14:45,960 --> 06:14:48,880
That is the real revolution in weaponry.

7670
06:14:49,000 --> 06:14:49,900
Don't you agree?

7671
06:14:52,900 --> 06:14:57,680
But the fool in charge shall Sokolov.

7672
06:14:57,920 --> 06:14:58,680
Oh god.

7673
06:14:58,680 --> 06:14:59,600
And where is Sokolov?

7674
06:15:00,360 --> 06:15:02,460
My project has been terminated.

7675
06:15:02,720 --> 06:15:05,660
The philosopher's legacy has been handed over to him.

7676
06:15:05,880 --> 06:15:07,720
What the hell are you talking about?

7677
06:15:08,460 --> 06:15:09,780
It's too good.

7678
06:15:12,980 --> 06:15:14,220
He's so dumb.

7679
06:15:14,620 --> 06:15:15,940
The philosopher's legacy.

7680
06:15:17,360 --> 06:15:19,120
Haven't you heard of the philosophers?

7681
06:15:20,880 --> 06:15:22,140
Such whimsy music.

7682
06:15:22,560 --> 06:15:24,220
The colonel has inherited their immense legacy.

7683
06:15:26,460 --> 06:15:29,580
Volgin's father was in charge of the philosopher's money and wealth.

7684
06:15:29,600 --> 06:15:30,480
He was in charge of all the laundering activities.

7685
06:15:31,400 --> 06:15:31,980
Oh.

7686
06:15:32,700 --> 06:15:37,180
In the confusion of the war, they somehow ended up with their treasure.

7687
06:15:38,400 --> 06:15:41,160
I think he should make some kind of T-Rex machine.

7688
06:15:41,380 --> 06:15:42,300
Volgin inherited that treasure illegally.

7689
06:15:42,600 --> 06:15:43,380
Yeah, I agree.

7690
06:15:44,600 --> 06:15:47,640
We never need to worry about the military budget.

7691
06:15:48,140 --> 06:15:52,820
The development costs at our facility are all paid out of the colonel's deep pockets.

7692
06:15:53,220 --> 06:15:54,460
Deep, deep pockets.

7693
06:15:54,460 --> 06:16:01,200
The weapons born here will be the genes for creating an entirely new form of warfare.

7694
06:16:01,940 --> 06:16:03,520
Are they talking about the Patriots?

7695
06:16:03,560 --> 06:16:04,960
This is pre-Patriots.

7696
06:16:05,000 --> 06:16:07,400
Funding for my research came out of that legacy.

7697
06:16:09,340 --> 06:16:09,960
Paid out of it.

7698
06:16:09,960 --> 06:16:10,220
Basically, yeah.

7699
06:16:10,340 --> 06:16:11,860
It's like proto-Patriots.

7700
06:16:11,900 --> 06:16:17,680
Now, my money, my men, all have been diverted to the Shag-O-Hod project.

7701
06:16:18,020 --> 06:16:20,520
Tomorrow, they will be conducting the final test.

7702
06:16:20,820 --> 06:16:28,960
While Sokolov is making the final preparations, in the weapons factory at Volgin's main base, the Great Fortress of Krasnigrad...

7703
06:16:28,960 --> 06:16:30,540
It's so funny if you think about it.

7704
06:16:30,620 --> 06:16:32,440
We destroyed the Shag-O-Hod.

7705
06:16:32,660 --> 06:16:35,540
So they're just like, you know what, let's go with Granon's plan instead.

7706
06:16:37,880 --> 06:16:38,800
It's our fault!

7707
06:16:39,940 --> 06:16:40,880
Of course.

7708
06:16:44,260 --> 06:16:47,440
They were like, oh wait a second, this guy's got like a good idea.

7709
06:16:49,960 --> 06:16:51,120
Are you mad?

7710
06:16:51,420 --> 06:16:53,160
It's an impenetrable fortress.

7711
06:16:53,920 --> 06:16:55,100
I'm sure it is.

7712
06:16:55,180 --> 06:16:55,640
Dang it.

7713
06:16:55,840 --> 06:16:56,700
You'll be killed.

7714
06:16:57,080 --> 06:16:58,220
I'll take my chances.

7715
06:16:59,480 --> 06:16:59,900
Wait.

7716
06:17:00,040 --> 06:17:01,080
Rex is way cooler too.

7717
06:17:01,160 --> 06:17:01,660
I know, right?

7718
06:17:01,980 --> 06:17:03,140
They have no taste.

7719
06:17:03,320 --> 06:17:03,680
Listen to me, you fool.

7720
06:17:03,940 --> 06:17:07,080
They like saw this and were just like, we don't want it to work.

7721
06:17:07,680 --> 06:17:08,360
Help me.

7722
06:17:09,300 --> 06:17:10,980
To thank you for your compliment.

7723
06:17:12,200 --> 06:17:13,080
What compliment?

7724
06:17:13,360 --> 06:17:15,060
Oh my god, he can't even remember.

7725
06:17:15,080 --> 06:17:15,500
My shoes.

7726
06:17:17,580 --> 06:17:18,760
Tatyana gave them to me.

7727
06:17:18,820 --> 06:17:21,200
I wanted to thank you for complimenting me on them.

7728
06:17:22,060 --> 06:17:22,900
Tatyana, Tatyana.

7729
06:17:22,900 --> 06:17:24,460
I'll tell you how to get into the fortress.

7730
06:17:24,840 --> 06:17:25,140
Okay.

7731
06:17:25,320 --> 06:17:26,260
Yeah, tell us.

7732
06:17:26,480 --> 06:17:31,240
In return, I ask only that you get that idiot out of there and destroy the Shagohan.

7733
06:17:31,340 --> 06:17:32,060
I can do that.

7734
06:17:32,380 --> 06:17:36,220
There is an underground tunnel that runs around the perimeter of the fortress.

7735
06:17:36,220 --> 06:17:36,940
Nice shoes.

7736
06:17:38,020 --> 06:17:41,640
You should be able to use it to sneak into the base.

7737
06:17:41,680 --> 06:17:43,800
One question, does it have a really long ladder?

7738
06:17:44,100 --> 06:17:45,020
Head to the mountains.

7739
06:17:46,600 --> 06:17:48,920
The entrance to the tunnel is located there.

7740
06:17:49,120 --> 06:17:49,520
Okay.

7741
06:17:49,760 --> 06:17:50,480
Take this.

7742
06:17:51,240 --> 06:17:52,260
Oh, what is that?

7743
06:17:54,580 --> 06:17:55,760
A bingo card.

7744
06:18:00,660 --> 06:18:05,040
You passed through a warehouse on your way here, didn't you?

7745
06:18:05,180 --> 06:18:06,700
Yeah, I even blew it up.

7746
06:18:06,880 --> 06:18:09,940
There should have been a locked door inside of it.

7747
06:18:10,340 --> 06:18:11,140
There what?

7748
06:18:11,320 --> 06:18:12,080
Do you remember it?

7749
06:18:12,500 --> 06:18:13,080
Uh...

7750
06:18:13,820 --> 06:18:18,880
This key will open that door.

7751
06:18:19,240 --> 06:18:20,560
A locked door?

7752
06:18:21,220 --> 06:18:23,720
Beyond that door lies a vast jungle.

7753
06:18:24,540 --> 06:18:25,220
Uh...

7754
06:18:25,220 --> 06:18:28,200
You can climb up into the mountains from the far end of the jungle.

7755
06:18:30,120 --> 06:18:31,760
Go back to the warehouse.

7756
06:18:33,100 --> 06:18:35,140
Use the key to open the locked door.

7757
06:18:35,140 --> 06:18:36,060
Isn't that the very front?

7758
06:18:36,440 --> 06:18:37,940
And head for the mountains.

7759
06:18:38,160 --> 06:18:39,400
The Russian jungles.

7760
06:18:39,620 --> 06:18:40,240
Got it.

7761
06:18:41,080 --> 06:18:41,860
Got it.

7762
06:18:47,980 --> 06:18:49,480
Why are you helping me?

7763
06:18:50,480 --> 06:18:55,200
Unlike Sokolov, the thought of defecting has never once cleared my mind.

7764
06:18:55,220 --> 06:18:56,140
I trust my mind.

7765
06:18:58,700 --> 06:19:02,500
I love my country.

7766
06:19:02,820 --> 06:19:03,400
No.

7767
06:19:03,880 --> 06:19:05,720
I love this land.

7768
06:19:06,940 --> 06:19:09,920
I cannot even imagine living anywhere else.

7769
06:19:10,220 --> 06:19:12,060
I've blown it up a little times.

7770
06:19:12,960 --> 06:19:15,900
I wish to remain a hero.

7771
06:19:16,460 --> 06:19:17,180
Okay.

7772
06:19:17,440 --> 06:19:18,980
Of the great motherland.

7773
06:19:19,500 --> 06:19:19,860
Okay.

7774
06:19:20,220 --> 06:19:22,200
They're like, that is Sokolov.

7775
06:19:22,700 --> 06:19:23,420
Traitorous.

7776
06:19:23,420 --> 06:19:24,120
Traitorous.

7777
06:19:24,120 --> 06:19:24,300
Dog.

7778
06:19:24,300 --> 06:19:26,700
Being hounded into a corner and left to waste away.

7779
06:19:28,740 --> 06:19:30,360
It is already dawn.

7780
06:19:30,680 --> 06:19:31,220
Oh, wow.

7781
06:19:31,320 --> 06:19:31,540
Early.

7782
06:19:31,760 --> 06:19:32,380
You must hurry.

7783
06:19:32,580 --> 06:19:33,020
Okay.

7784
06:19:33,880 --> 06:19:37,100
I will remain here and nurse my troubles for a little longer.

7785
06:19:41,160 --> 06:19:42,400
We're about to fight.

7786
06:19:43,960 --> 06:19:44,440
Okay.

7787
06:19:44,480 --> 06:19:45,540
I think I remember now.

7788
06:19:46,020 --> 06:19:46,500
Capitalism.

7789
06:19:48,220 --> 06:19:49,040
Go home.

7790
06:19:49,040 --> 06:19:50,200
You're drunk, mister.

7791
06:19:51,060 --> 06:19:51,940
Go home.

7792
06:19:52,920 --> 06:19:53,400
You're drunk, mister.

7793
06:19:55,020 --> 06:19:55,460
Be careful of what you do.

7794
06:19:58,880 --> 06:19:59,700
What was I saying?

7795
06:20:01,760 --> 06:20:04,120
In that trap area, isn't that where the fear is?

7796
06:20:04,240 --> 06:20:05,060
Now I remember.

7797
06:20:05,700 --> 06:20:06,720
Or think about it.

7798
06:20:08,520 --> 06:20:12,820
You think they'll notice if I turn back into a scientist.

7799
06:20:18,310 --> 06:20:21,130
Do you think they'll care if I'm a scientist again?

7800
06:20:21,970 --> 06:20:23,570
I gotta get out of this area, though.

7801
06:20:24,430 --> 06:20:26,190
Do you think they'll be like, hey, that's a great idea.

7802
06:20:26,190 --> 06:20:27,150
Who's the guy we were after?

7803
06:20:34,090 --> 06:20:34,750
Can

7804
06:20:39,570 --> 06:20:44,050
you let me out through your window?

7805
06:20:45,240 --> 06:20:47,150
So I can live in peace.

7806
06:20:50,630 --> 06:20:52,510
I just need an exit.

7807
06:20:55,550 --> 06:20:56,210
Okay...

7808
06:20:56,210 --> 06:20:57,050
But...

7809
06:21:00,230 --> 06:21:01,910
You guys, I wanna save.

7810
06:21:02,290 --> 06:21:03,830
Oh, I'm so scared to save!

7811
06:21:04,450 --> 06:21:05,550
To capitalism.

7812
06:21:06,090 --> 06:21:07,470
If I die though...

7813
06:21:08,930 --> 06:21:11,210
I can just start back at the same area.

7814
06:21:14,230 --> 06:21:15,750
I'm not knocking!

7815
06:21:18,150 --> 06:21:18,830
Right?

7816
06:21:18,830 --> 06:21:19,510
Like...

7817
06:21:25,300 --> 06:21:26,520
Do save one.

7818
06:21:30,280 --> 06:21:31,460
I'm too scared.

7819
06:21:31,740 --> 06:21:32,140
Okay.

7820
06:21:32,400 --> 06:21:33,180
If I die...

7821
06:21:35,900 --> 06:21:37,240
I just wanna...

7822
06:21:37,240 --> 06:21:38,620
I don't want to waste...

7823
06:21:39,320 --> 06:21:39,900
What's the words?

7824
06:21:42,020 --> 06:21:42,880
Oh my gosh.

7825
06:21:42,960 --> 06:21:43,660
Don't notice me.

7826
06:21:44,360 --> 06:21:46,240
I don't wanna waste materials, you know?

7827
06:21:47,280 --> 06:21:48,180
I'm just gonna run through.

7828
06:21:52,830 --> 06:21:54,590
Like if I get into a fight, you know?

7829
06:21:54,670 --> 06:21:54,970
I don't know.

7830
06:21:55,290 --> 06:21:56,090
I guess it's fine.

7831
06:21:56,130 --> 06:21:56,570
I get a lot.

7832
06:21:57,150 --> 06:21:57,510
Okay.

7833
06:22:03,350 --> 06:22:04,570
If I run past him...

7834
06:22:05,630 --> 06:22:06,610
He won't notice me.

7835
06:22:10,440 --> 06:22:10,880
Safe.

7836
06:22:13,980 --> 06:22:14,420
Safe!

7837
06:22:16,400 --> 06:22:17,660
Can I open this?

7838
06:22:19,080 --> 06:22:19,520
Nope.

7839
06:22:19,720 --> 06:22:20,380
You know what?

7840
06:22:20,400 --> 06:22:20,980
Let's just go back.

7841
06:22:21,360 --> 06:22:22,320
The way we came.

7842
06:22:24,120 --> 06:22:24,560
Okay.

7843
06:22:26,240 --> 06:22:28,180
No stinking doctors to...

7844
06:22:29,080 --> 06:22:30,060
ruin my time.

7845
06:22:31,520 --> 06:22:33,760
I think the cigarettes were in that barred window room.

7846
06:22:34,020 --> 06:22:36,980
I could have sworn the cigarettes are...

7847
06:22:36,980 --> 06:22:38,300
Wait, the office has the cig spray.

7848
06:22:38,380 --> 06:22:38,680
It does?

7849
06:22:38,840 --> 06:22:39,300
For real?

7850
06:22:39,300 --> 06:22:41,760
Wait, I could have sworn they were...

7851
06:22:41,760 --> 06:22:43,220
when you become...

7852
06:22:43,220 --> 06:22:43,460
Rykov.

7853
06:22:50,130 --> 06:22:50,850
No way.

7854
06:22:54,760 --> 06:22:56,040
If you miss them here...

7855
06:22:56,840 --> 06:22:59,760
Well, that would explain why I didn't get them before.

7856
06:23:04,970 --> 06:23:06,590
I just need this guy to leave.

7857
06:23:14,900 --> 06:23:16,000
Cig gas spray!

7858
06:23:17,560 --> 06:23:17,960
Waaah!

7859
06:23:19,640 --> 06:23:20,240
Oops, sorry.

7860
06:23:22,000 --> 06:23:22,840
Oh, my gosh!

7861
06:23:23,340 --> 06:23:24,640
Wow, thanks guys, I learned that.

7862
06:23:25,940 --> 06:23:27,300
Why do they all walk funny?

7863
06:23:27,380 --> 06:23:28,580
That's why I'm not out of place.

7864
06:23:30,200 --> 06:23:31,420
We're all just a little...

7865
06:23:31,420 --> 06:23:33,380
we all got really bad scoliosis here.

7866
06:23:50,410 --> 06:23:51,210
Excuse me.

7867
06:23:52,330 --> 06:23:52,970
Excuse me.

7868
06:23:53,150 --> 06:23:53,350
Excuse me.

7869
06:23:54,150 --> 06:23:54,550
I'm fine.

7870
06:23:54,550 --> 06:23:54,810
Okay.

7871
06:23:54,810 --> 06:23:54,950
Okay.

7872
06:23:54,950 --> 06:23:55,050
Thank you.

7873
06:23:55,050 --> 06:23:56,570
I'm scared of someone opening this door.

7874
06:23:57,050 --> 06:23:58,090
Someone else open it!

7875
06:23:59,630 --> 06:24:02,610
I'm afraid they're gonna be right there and they're gonna touch me and then I'm gonna get in trouble!

7876
06:24:16,780 --> 06:24:20,260
There it is.

7877
06:24:22,630 --> 06:24:23,030
Okay.

7878
06:24:26,730 --> 06:24:29,250
I'm just a little scientist in this room.

7879
06:24:30,850 --> 06:24:31,850
Another door opened.

7880
06:24:33,710 --> 06:24:34,650
Okay, now leave.

7881
06:24:38,290 --> 06:24:39,450
And I'll follow you.

7882
06:24:39,510 --> 06:24:41,230
You are so slow!

7883
06:24:48,840 --> 06:24:51,020
I'm slowly trying to get around you.

7884
06:24:56,740 --> 06:24:57,980
How did I come in?

7885
06:24:58,140 --> 06:25:00,200
Oh, maybe I should leave the same way I came in.

7886
06:25:03,500 --> 06:25:05,840
How do I... Okay, we go back through.

7887
06:25:05,920 --> 06:25:06,420
Yes, yes, yes.

7888
06:25:06,540 --> 06:25:06,920
Okay, I remember.

7889
06:25:12,180 --> 06:25:13,320
Yeah, I came in through the vent.

7890
06:25:13,540 --> 06:25:15,360
I think I'm gonna leave through the vent as well.

7891
06:25:16,580 --> 06:25:17,080
Excuse me!

7892
06:25:25,190 --> 06:25:25,850
Excuse me!

7893
06:25:28,490 --> 06:25:30,190
Can't believe we kinda made that, actually.

7894
06:25:32,110 --> 06:25:32,930
Oh, my bad.

7895
06:25:36,480 --> 06:25:36,840
Huh.

7896
06:25:37,920 --> 06:25:39,100
You saw nothing!

7897
06:25:42,300 --> 06:25:44,500
You saw nothing!

7898
06:25:51,430 --> 06:25:57,620
Oh, oh, I forgot to...

7899
06:26:08,060 --> 06:26:08,820
Please.

7900
06:26:08,980 --> 06:26:10,300
Don't get caught, snake.

7901
06:26:10,560 --> 06:26:11,300
Snake.

7902
06:26:11,780 --> 06:26:12,360
Oh, gosh.

7903
06:26:12,360 --> 06:26:12,380
Oh, my gosh.

7904
06:26:19,880 --> 06:26:21,100
And... tiger's drop.

7905
06:26:27,630 --> 06:26:28,190
Uh...

7906
06:26:29,690 --> 06:26:30,250
Okay.

7907
06:26:31,110 --> 06:26:32,030
Thank you, mice.

7908
06:26:34,050 --> 06:26:35,890
I think the dog's awake and everybody.

7909
06:26:37,870 --> 06:26:39,470
I think everybody's awake now.

7910
06:26:40,850 --> 06:26:41,530
Beep, beep!

7911
06:26:46,240 --> 06:26:47,300
I hear someone.

7912
06:26:47,960 --> 06:26:49,400
Do I see them?

7913
06:26:50,100 --> 06:26:51,540
Not even a little bit.

7914
06:26:52,720 --> 06:26:53,980
Oh, there they are.

7915
06:26:54,780 --> 06:26:56,560
Good morning, gamers!

7916
06:27:09,030 --> 06:27:10,650
Y'all woke up from your nap?

7917
06:27:12,250 --> 06:27:13,170
Oh, my gosh.

7918
06:27:14,990 --> 06:27:16,070
He'll... he'll get caught.

7919
06:27:16,210 --> 06:27:16,750
It's fine.

7920
06:27:18,930 --> 06:27:19,450
Huh?

7921
06:27:23,170 --> 06:27:24,210
Yeah, exactly.

7922
06:27:30,410 --> 06:27:34,330
Ah, it's such a nice, bright, sunny morning.

7923
06:27:35,960 --> 06:27:38,030
The dawn of a new day.

7924
06:27:39,130 --> 06:27:41,090
It's beautiful outside.

7925
06:27:44,880 --> 06:27:47,470
We're just gonna crawl the way we came in.

7926
06:27:49,430 --> 06:27:50,170
Yup.

7927
06:27:50,270 --> 06:27:51,570
See you later, everybody.

7928
06:27:52,850 --> 06:27:53,870
Later, later.

7929
06:27:55,110 --> 06:27:55,850
Crocodiles.

7930
06:27:58,910 --> 06:28:00,630
I think I can loot this guy.

7931
06:28:01,930 --> 06:28:03,110
Give me what you got.

7932
06:28:06,210 --> 06:28:06,790
Nothing.

7933
06:28:06,890 --> 06:28:07,250
Okay.

7934
06:28:07,830 --> 06:28:08,410
Oh.

7935
06:28:08,490 --> 06:28:08,610
Look.

7936
06:28:09,670 --> 06:28:10,590
All right.

7937
06:28:12,910 --> 06:28:14,790
And back through our holes.

7938
06:28:17,470 --> 06:28:18,050
Nice.

7939
06:28:20,350 --> 06:28:20,930
Okay.

7940
06:28:22,610 --> 06:28:23,190
Now...

7941
06:28:24,590 --> 06:28:25,490
I'm going to...

7942
06:28:25,490 --> 06:28:25,830
What?

7943
06:28:28,370 --> 06:28:29,970
I'm too scared though, you guys.

7944
06:28:31,070 --> 06:28:32,050
Gosh, I'm scared.

7945
06:28:32,290 --> 06:28:33,250
I'm scared to save!

7946
06:28:34,090 --> 06:28:34,970
I'm so scared.

7947
06:28:37,690 --> 06:28:38,690
I'm so scared.

7948
06:28:41,090 --> 06:28:42,230
Do you want to save?

7949
06:28:49,010 --> 06:28:49,970
Let's do...

7950
06:28:53,340 --> 06:28:53,820
one.

7951
06:28:59,840 --> 06:29:01,780
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

7952
06:29:05,240 --> 06:29:05,760
Yes!

7953
06:29:08,300 --> 06:29:13,280
Snake, have you ever seen For a Fistful of Dollars?

7954
06:29:13,500 --> 06:29:16,660
Oh, paramedic, I've never been so happy to see you before ever.

7955
06:29:17,560 --> 06:29:18,400
Spaghetti Western.

7956
06:29:18,940 --> 06:29:19,460
Spaghetti!

7957
06:29:19,500 --> 06:29:20,300
It's really cool.

7958
06:29:20,660 --> 06:29:23,160
Especially the main character's stylish gunplay.

7959
06:29:23,800 --> 06:29:24,320
Gunplay.

7960
06:29:24,900 --> 06:29:29,220
I saw it in England on the Major's recommendation, but it hasn't come out on stage yet.

7961
06:29:29,960 --> 06:29:31,200
It's so cool.

7962
06:29:31,680 --> 06:29:33,440
They'll bring it to America, I'm sure.

7963
06:29:33,480 --> 06:29:34,660
You have to see it somewhere.

7964
06:29:35,200 --> 06:29:35,720
Sure.

7965
06:29:37,420 --> 06:29:37,940
Sure.

7966
06:29:46,890 --> 06:29:47,950
I hear him.

7967
06:29:51,280 --> 06:29:53,100
I hear him, I just don't...

7968
06:29:56,220 --> 06:29:57,320
He's on his way.

7969
06:30:05,290 --> 06:30:06,850
How tall do you think he'll be?

7970
06:30:11,800 --> 06:30:13,880
Wait, is he behind me?

7971
06:30:17,750 --> 06:30:18,270
Okay.

7972
06:30:19,510 --> 06:30:20,430
Can you imagine?

7973
06:30:23,130 --> 06:30:24,670
He's right behind me...

7974
06:30:24,670 --> 06:30:25,390
Isn't he?

7975
06:30:27,490 --> 06:30:28,630
What did I just see?

7976
06:30:28,630 --> 06:30:28,890
One centimeter.

7977
06:30:34,570 --> 06:30:35,130
Hello?

7978
06:30:39,530 --> 06:30:40,090
Hello?

7979
06:30:43,500 --> 06:30:44,620
I'm waiting for you.

7980
06:30:53,180 --> 06:30:54,520
I can't tell if he's...

7981
06:31:13,930 --> 06:31:14,970
There we go.

7982
06:31:15,170 --> 06:31:16,370
Snake, snake, snake!

7983
06:31:16,890 --> 06:31:18,390
This is no time for circles!

7984
06:31:18,870 --> 06:31:19,470
Okay, there we go.

7985
06:31:23,270 --> 06:31:24,590
Can I get the doll?

7986
06:31:24,790 --> 06:31:26,770
We'll get them from another spot.

7987
06:31:37,680 --> 06:31:38,400
Look at them!

7988
06:31:38,460 --> 06:31:39,200
They're teaming up!

7989
06:31:42,780 --> 06:31:45,100
The dog and the guy are teaming up.

7990
06:31:48,280 --> 06:31:49,320
We'll get him first.

7991
06:31:55,480 --> 06:31:56,560
Oh, there's two of them!

7992
06:31:57,900 --> 06:31:58,420
Oops.

7993
06:31:59,400 --> 06:32:00,860
I think?

7994
06:32:02,480 --> 06:32:03,320
Am I crazy?

7995
06:32:09,960 --> 06:32:11,520
The dog is confused.

7996
06:32:12,880 --> 06:32:14,440
Wait, can the dog wake him up?

7997
06:32:15,340 --> 06:32:16,360
I don't think so.

7998
06:32:18,040 --> 06:32:20,560
The dog says, I don't know, I'm a dog.

7999
06:32:24,780 --> 06:32:27,100
These are bizarre human shenanigans.

8000
06:32:35,160 --> 06:32:35,840
Okay.

8001
06:32:42,680 --> 06:32:50,850
I don't remember how this fight goes either, but let's do it, baby!

8002
06:32:53,670 --> 06:32:54,350
Okay.

8003
06:32:57,130 --> 06:32:58,130
Thanks for the dog.

8004
06:33:06,290 --> 06:33:09,590
Oh my gosh.

8005
06:33:16,090 --> 06:33:17,210
My fears.

8006
06:33:18,930 --> 06:33:20,410
I'm actually afraid of needles.

8007
06:33:20,710 --> 06:33:22,890
An arrow is kind of like a thicker needle.

8008
06:33:23,690 --> 06:33:24,890
It's my real fear.

8009
06:33:25,950 --> 06:33:26,670
Ow!

8010
06:33:28,370 --> 06:33:30,890
We need to throw your Bulbocos, Snake.

8011
06:33:31,650 --> 06:33:33,950
Oh wait, that was your stomach.

8012
06:33:36,110 --> 06:33:38,210
That was also the fake mango.

8013
06:33:39,050 --> 06:33:41,090
We don't need any Bulbocos.

8014
06:33:42,310 --> 06:33:43,030
Ah,

8015
06:33:50,450 --> 06:33:51,270
the fear!

8016
06:33:53,030 --> 06:33:53,390
Eww!

8017
06:33:57,100 --> 06:33:57,820
Hahaha.

8018
06:33:58,120 --> 06:34:01,620
That throat is coated in the venom of the Brazilian wandering spider.

8019
06:34:01,980 --> 06:34:02,140
Oh.

8020
06:34:02,140 --> 06:34:06,260
Soon, a most exquisite pain will engulf your entire body.

8021
06:34:06,960 --> 06:34:08,580
Your limbs will be paralyzed.

8022
06:34:08,960 --> 06:34:10,680
Your lungs cease to draw breath.

8023
06:34:11,560 --> 06:34:13,560
Eventually, your heart will stop beating.

8024
06:34:14,100 --> 06:34:16,840
Ah, but what fun would that be?

8025
06:34:17,460 --> 06:34:19,100
Not a fitting day at all.

8026
06:34:23,120 --> 06:34:24,620
The boss's apprentice.

8027
06:34:25,100 --> 06:34:25,700
That's me.

8028
06:34:26,700 --> 06:34:30,200
I will give you fear such as you've never experienced before.

8029
06:34:33,060 --> 06:34:34,780
Come into my web.

8030
06:34:37,160 --> 06:34:38,620
It is time.

8031
06:34:42,160 --> 06:34:44,680
For you to feel the fear.

8032
06:34:44,880 --> 06:34:45,400
The fear.

8033
06:34:50,800 --> 06:34:51,800
Oh boy.

8034
06:35:01,880 --> 06:35:02,820
First we cure.

8035
06:35:04,880 --> 06:35:05,900
First we eat.

8036
06:35:06,660 --> 06:35:07,960
Let's have... you know what?

8037
06:35:08,040 --> 06:35:08,940
I'm gonna eat a cow... no.

8038
06:35:09,240 --> 06:35:11,380
Sorry, I'm trying to eat all my stuff that's gonna expire.

8039
06:35:11,480 --> 06:35:14,060
Which is... oh, okay, here we go.

8040
06:35:14,140 --> 06:35:15,360
Oh my gosh, we're gonna eat the best food.

8041
06:35:16,460 --> 06:35:17,340
Instant noodles!

8042
06:35:21,660 --> 06:35:22,100
Delicious.

8043
06:35:22,480 --> 06:35:23,360
Mmm, delicious.

8044
06:35:24,120 --> 06:35:25,460
I should have gotten more food.

8045
06:35:25,920 --> 06:35:26,520
You know what?

8046
06:35:26,600 --> 06:35:26,780
It's okay.

8047
06:35:29,080 --> 06:35:29,960
Uh... cure?

8048
06:35:31,540 --> 06:35:31,980
Serum?

8049
06:35:33,580 --> 06:35:37,340
Oh, N-R-E-O-O-N... okay, uh...

8050
06:35:37,920 --> 06:35:39,080
What do I do for this?

8051
06:35:41,140 --> 06:35:42,640
Mmm, gunshot wound?

8052
06:35:44,360 --> 06:35:45,440
Uh... cut?

8053
06:35:46,920 --> 06:35:48,060
Removing bullets and arrows!

8054
06:35:48,620 --> 06:35:48,900
Okay.

8055
06:35:49,920 --> 06:35:54,420
Now it's... the bolt is extracted, so now we just...

8056
06:35:54,420 --> 06:35:55,380
ViviCore, thanks for the gift card!

8057
06:35:56,040 --> 06:35:59,640
We do... d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-disinfect...

8058
06:36:00,300 --> 06:36:01,560
I don't wanna waste stuff.

8059
06:36:03,480 --> 06:36:04,020
Okay.

8060
06:36:04,620 --> 06:36:05,160
Disinfect.

8061
06:36:05,640 --> 06:36:06,180
Oh!

8062
06:36:06,240 --> 06:36:09,120
It works.

8063
06:36:10,020 --> 06:36:13,680
If you leave in... the bolts during the fight, they stay there for the rest of the game.

8064
06:36:15,320 --> 06:36:16,300
Wait, what do you mean?

8065
06:36:16,520 --> 06:36:17,640
Like... the bo- like...

8066
06:36:17,640 --> 06:36:18,800
The arrows?

8067
06:36:23,300 --> 06:36:24,240
Um... okay.

8068
06:36:25,000 --> 06:36:26,380
Ha- okay, so...

8069
06:36:28,200 --> 06:36:31,600
This is like a thermal goggle type of fight.

8070
06:36:32,100 --> 06:36:35,220
Cause he goes all invisible and all this fun stuff.

8071
06:36:39,760 --> 06:36:41,640
I don't remember the soundtrack at all.

8072
06:36:41,640 --> 06:36:43,120
Why does it sound like...

8073
06:36:44,720 --> 06:36:46,200
It sounds so...

8074
06:36:46,200 --> 06:36:47,520
It sounds like...

8075
06:36:51,540 --> 06:36:53,660
Like some Disney jungle theme.

8076
06:36:56,960 --> 06:36:58,440
What's the speedrun strat?

8077
06:37:02,700 --> 06:37:05,380
Speed... thermal goggles on temporarily when he's invisible.

8078
06:37:05,520 --> 06:37:07,240
Yeah, I'm gonna kill my eyes.

8079
06:37:07,700 --> 06:37:08,620
For real.

8080
06:37:11,640 --> 06:37:12,060
Are there...

8081
06:37:20,060 --> 06:37:20,680
I'm fear!

8082
06:37:20,840 --> 06:37:21,240
I'm fear!

8083
06:37:21,320 --> 06:37:21,720
I'm fear!

8084
06:37:23,700 --> 06:37:24,060
Ow!

8085
06:37:24,240 --> 06:37:24,640
Oh gosh.

8086
06:37:25,120 --> 06:37:25,720
That was close.

8087
06:37:28,440 --> 06:37:28,800
Fear!

8088
06:37:28,800 --> 06:37:29,160
Okay.

8089
06:37:29,580 --> 06:37:31,020
How the hell do I do this again?

8090
06:37:34,340 --> 06:37:35,020
Oh, I see him!

8091
06:37:38,300 --> 06:37:38,660
No!

8092
06:37:44,030 --> 06:37:44,950
Is he still there?

8093
06:37:45,050 --> 06:37:45,630
Oh yes he is.

8094
06:37:46,710 --> 06:37:47,230
Got him.

8095
06:37:47,670 --> 06:37:48,730
Oh, it did like...

8096
06:37:48,730 --> 06:37:50,890
The littlest, tiniest bit of damage ever.

8097
06:37:51,490 --> 06:37:51,990
That's okay.

8098
06:38:02,000 --> 06:38:02,660
Oh, I see him.

8099
06:38:02,700 --> 06:38:02,900
I see him.

8100
06:38:13,870 --> 06:38:14,630
Is he still there?

8101
06:38:14,670 --> 06:38:14,830
Yeah.

8102
06:38:16,030 --> 06:38:16,610
Oh my gosh.

8103
06:38:16,630 --> 06:38:17,190
Turn around snake.

8104
06:38:17,510 --> 06:38:17,870
No!

8105
06:38:17,990 --> 06:38:18,810
I lost him.

8106
06:38:18,830 --> 06:38:19,230
I was too slow.

8107
06:38:25,870 --> 06:38:26,970
Can you save me?

8108
06:38:27,050 --> 06:38:27,730
I can actually.

8109
06:38:30,870 --> 06:38:31,230
Okay.

8110
06:38:36,400 --> 06:38:36,760
Shoot.

8111
06:38:36,760 --> 06:38:36,840
Shoot.

8112
06:38:40,180 --> 06:38:40,640
No!

8113
06:38:43,790 --> 06:38:44,530
Where did he go?

8114
06:38:44,690 --> 06:38:46,150
Your eyes cannot find me.

8115
06:38:47,310 --> 06:38:48,190
Oh, shoot.

8116
06:38:48,910 --> 06:38:49,610
Oh, okay.

8117
06:38:49,670 --> 06:38:50,010
He's there.

8118
06:38:50,090 --> 06:38:50,550
Oh, okay.

8119
06:38:50,630 --> 06:38:50,850
I see him.

8120
06:38:52,050 --> 06:38:52,510
Ouch!

8121
06:38:52,550 --> 06:38:52,830
Ouch!

8122
06:38:52,930 --> 06:38:53,170
Ouch!

8123
06:38:53,170 --> 06:38:53,350
Ouch!

8124
06:38:53,930 --> 06:38:54,390
No!

8125
06:38:56,970 --> 06:38:57,430
Shit.

8126
06:38:58,210 --> 06:38:58,990
Oh, hold on.

8127
06:38:59,090 --> 06:39:01,070
Let me also take off my...

8128
06:39:02,950 --> 06:39:03,410
Suppressor.

8129
06:39:17,310 --> 06:39:18,270
Oh my gosh.

8130
06:39:18,450 --> 06:39:19,450
Snake, how are you alive?

8131
06:39:20,170 --> 06:39:20,690
Snake!

8132
06:39:21,970 --> 06:39:23,390
Snake, how are you...

8133
06:39:23,990 --> 06:39:25,570
How are you alive, snake?

8134
06:39:26,110 --> 06:39:27,570
How did you live through this?

8135
06:39:29,550 --> 06:39:30,670
Oh my gosh.

8136
06:39:32,350 --> 06:39:35,370
It's like not even like a little bit deep.

8137
06:39:35,470 --> 06:39:37,090
It's like ultimate deep.

8138
06:39:40,510 --> 06:39:43,290
Snake, that's... that's a... that's a pretty big deal, buddy.

8139
06:39:43,470 --> 06:39:48,930
I think that's a big... that's a big thing going on.

8140
06:39:53,910 --> 06:39:54,690
Oh my gosh.

8141
06:39:54,930 --> 06:39:55,310
Okay.

8142
06:40:02,330 --> 06:40:04,010
I can see you, kind of.

8143
06:40:04,050 --> 06:40:04,450
Okay.

8144
06:40:04,790 --> 06:40:06,610
I'm afraid of you attacking me, though.

8145
06:40:06,670 --> 06:40:07,070
There we go.

8146
06:40:10,250 --> 06:40:11,610
He just left again.

8147
06:40:12,030 --> 06:40:12,770
Oh, I see him.

8148
06:40:14,810 --> 06:40:16,130
Oh, he's in my tree?

8149
06:40:16,350 --> 06:40:17,170
Oh, gross.

8150
06:40:18,490 --> 06:40:22,220
I gotta be faster.

8151
06:40:22,480 --> 06:40:22,980
Oh, fuck.

8152
06:40:23,020 --> 06:40:24,380
I keep getting a bad angle.

8153
06:40:25,240 --> 06:40:25,920
Wait, where is he?

8154
06:40:26,960 --> 06:40:27,500
There he is.

8155
06:40:27,540 --> 06:40:27,680
Okay.

8156
06:40:28,980 --> 06:40:29,320
Ouch!

8157
06:40:40,300 --> 06:40:43,140
It does like so little damage to him.

8158
06:41:02,830 --> 06:41:03,930
Ew, I hate when he does this.

8159
06:41:04,210 --> 06:41:04,810
Oh, can I see him?

8160
06:41:05,190 --> 06:41:05,750
Can I see him?

8161
06:41:05,890 --> 06:41:05,910
Oh.

8162
06:41:07,090 --> 06:41:07,430
Yeah!

8163
06:41:10,890 --> 06:41:11,610
I see him.

8164
06:41:15,800 --> 06:41:16,540
I see him.

8165
06:41:18,640 --> 06:41:19,360
That is him.

8166
06:41:19,480 --> 06:41:19,600
Oh.

8167
06:41:20,720 --> 06:41:21,460
Oh, just kidding.

8168
06:41:23,500 --> 06:41:24,220
Holy moly.

8169
06:41:28,440 --> 06:41:29,320
Where is he?

8170
06:41:30,340 --> 06:41:31,720
Actually, I don't know where he is at all.

8171
06:41:32,580 --> 06:41:33,300
Oh my gosh.

8172
06:41:34,940 --> 06:41:35,980
Where is it coming from?

8173
06:41:37,200 --> 06:41:37,560
Oh?

8174
06:41:39,240 --> 06:41:39,900
Where is it?

8175
06:41:40,100 --> 06:41:40,460
Oh.

8176
06:41:40,500 --> 06:41:40,740
Oh.

8177
06:41:49,440 --> 06:41:50,760
I'm like using sound.

8178
06:41:50,940 --> 06:41:51,060
Oh.

8179
06:41:55,100 --> 06:41:55,540
There!

8180
06:41:55,680 --> 06:41:55,860
There!

8181
06:41:57,840 --> 06:41:58,280
Got

8182
06:42:07,140 --> 06:42:08,040
him a couple times.

8183
06:42:08,380 --> 06:42:09,020
Oh, my bad.

8184
06:42:09,540 --> 06:42:10,800
I don't know where he shot at.

8185
06:42:15,570 --> 06:42:16,550
He's like a Pokémon.

8186
06:42:22,240 --> 06:42:22,680
Oh!

8187
06:42:27,740 --> 06:42:28,920
Shit, shit, shit!

8188
06:42:29,920 --> 06:42:30,360
Ew!

8189
06:42:31,640 --> 06:42:32,600
Son of a bitch.

8190
06:42:35,100 --> 06:42:35,860
Where did she go?

8191
06:42:38,700 --> 06:42:41,140
Usually, I can see him like swinging from the trees.

8192
06:42:42,080 --> 06:42:43,140
So, it's not all bad.

8193
06:42:44,520 --> 06:42:45,600
Wherever he is now, though.

8194
06:42:46,300 --> 06:42:47,180
Where the hell is he?

8195
06:42:47,260 --> 06:42:47,440
Ow!

8196
06:42:53,720 --> 06:42:54,080
Oh.

8197
06:42:54,080 --> 06:42:54,440
Oh.

8198
06:42:55,520 --> 06:42:56,120
There we go.

8199
06:42:56,200 --> 06:43:02,360
I don't think I got him.

8200
06:43:06,260 --> 06:43:06,700
Please!

8201
06:43:07,340 --> 06:43:08,040
Damn it.

8202
06:43:13,410 --> 06:43:14,090
Damn, don't go.

8203
06:43:16,230 --> 06:43:18,270
I don't like this spot that you go into.

8204
06:43:21,170 --> 06:43:21,910
Oh my gosh.

8205
06:43:24,750 --> 06:43:25,190
Ah!

8206
06:43:28,150 --> 06:43:28,590
Wait.

8207
06:43:29,470 --> 06:43:32,850
Snake, I need you to like look at the place that I'm looking at, okay?

8208
06:43:33,890 --> 06:43:34,830
Where did he go?

8209
06:43:35,490 --> 06:43:35,930
Shh.

8210
06:43:43,660 --> 06:43:44,800
Sorry, I'm gonna have to have it on.

8211
06:43:55,980 --> 06:43:57,360
What's the original camera like?

8212
06:43:57,500 --> 06:43:58,280
Oh, let's check it out.

8213
06:43:59,180 --> 06:44:00,240
Give me a second there.

8214
06:44:08,170 --> 06:44:08,590
Oh.

8215
06:44:10,070 --> 06:44:10,490
Please.

8216
06:44:19,880 --> 06:44:20,800
Oh, my god.

8217
06:44:33,500 --> 06:44:35,120
I'm gonna need more bullets soon.

8218
06:44:36,200 --> 06:44:36,620
No.

8219
06:44:38,980 --> 06:44:40,260
He's really scaring me.

8220
06:44:44,680 --> 06:44:45,720
He's scaring me.

8221
06:44:45,740 --> 06:44:46,660
Shotgun works too?

8222
06:44:47,220 --> 06:44:48,840
Oh, maybe I should do that then instead.

8223
06:44:52,680 --> 06:44:53,620
Oh, there he is.

8224
06:44:58,480 --> 06:45:00,160
I thought for sure he would stop there.

8225
06:45:01,480 --> 06:45:01,880
Hey,

8226
06:45:15,640 --> 06:45:16,300
this is awful.

8227
06:45:18,440 --> 06:45:19,360
Okay, hold on.

8228
06:45:21,440 --> 06:45:22,600
Let's add the shotgun.

8229
06:45:25,520 --> 06:45:27,620
If you catch him on the ground when he's getting food.

8230
06:45:28,320 --> 06:45:30,080
Yeah, the shotgun only works in a really short range.

8231
06:45:30,280 --> 06:45:30,580
I know.

8232
06:45:30,840 --> 06:45:31,520
Oh, AK?

8233
06:45:33,040 --> 06:45:34,020
Okay, let's see.

8234
06:45:34,560 --> 06:45:35,440
Let's put this away.

8235
06:45:35,500 --> 06:45:35,580
Okay.

8236
06:45:35,580 --> 06:45:36,000
Put this away.

8237
06:45:38,220 --> 06:45:41,340
Would the M16 be any good?

8238
06:45:54,330 --> 06:45:55,490
I can take away.

8239
06:45:56,650 --> 06:45:57,690
We'll just have all three.

8240
06:45:59,230 --> 06:46:01,610
Most likely I'll run out of ammo for something.

8241
06:46:03,810 --> 06:46:04,390
You know.

8242
06:46:04,510 --> 06:46:05,630
We don't...

8243
06:46:05,630 --> 06:46:06,370
I don't...

8244
06:46:07,810 --> 06:46:10,510
I think the SPD...

8245
06:46:11,190 --> 06:46:12,210
I think it'll be okay.

8246
06:46:12,710 --> 06:46:13,190
Okay.

8247
06:46:13,350 --> 06:46:13,570
Okay.

8248
06:46:19,100 --> 06:46:19,580
I think it'll be okay.

8249
06:46:19,580 --> 06:46:20,440
No AK stun.

8250
06:46:20,540 --> 06:46:22,960
I don't actually know the cheese for this, I'll be honest.

8251
06:46:26,660 --> 06:46:28,240
I don't know it.

8252
06:46:29,040 --> 06:46:30,360
Hold in first person view.

8253
06:46:32,240 --> 06:46:33,180
Let's try it.

8254
06:46:33,220 --> 06:46:33,780
Wait, what is it?

8255
06:46:34,260 --> 06:46:35,600
Toggle firing load with...

8256
06:46:37,140 --> 06:46:38,620
With the triangle button.

8257
06:46:39,340 --> 06:46:40,100
There's a...

8258
06:46:40,100 --> 06:46:41,380
You can get a suppressor for this?

8259
06:46:42,160 --> 06:46:42,640
Huh.

8260
06:46:52,200 --> 06:46:53,120
I actually get the suppressor.

8261
06:46:53,120 --> 06:46:53,520
I didn't hit him though!

8262
06:46:54,580 --> 06:46:56,560
I did hit him!

8263
06:46:56,980 --> 06:46:57,100
Oh

8264
06:47:08,170 --> 06:47:09,090
shoot!

8265
06:47:23,250 --> 06:47:23,890
Blast him!

8266
06:47:24,310 --> 06:47:25,670
Did I even get that much?

8267
06:47:25,730 --> 06:47:26,390
I didn't check.

8268
06:47:28,330 --> 06:47:28,810
Oh!

8269
06:47:34,610 --> 06:47:36,710
Actually, okay I'm out.

8270
06:47:36,910 --> 06:47:37,330
Okay.

8271
06:47:37,650 --> 06:47:38,490
I'll take it.

8272
06:47:40,590 --> 06:47:41,630
I don't know where he is.

8273
06:47:43,330 --> 06:47:43,510
There he is.

8274
06:47:44,130 --> 06:47:45,330
What are you doing over there?

8275
06:47:47,490 --> 06:47:48,470
I think he was over there.

8276
06:47:50,250 --> 06:47:51,070
Oh there he is, yeah.

8277
06:47:59,460 --> 06:48:00,020
Where's this one?

8278
06:48:01,260 --> 06:48:01,780
Where'd he go?

8279
06:48:03,500 --> 06:48:04,900
I have to watch out for traps even.

8280
06:48:08,060 --> 06:48:08,960
I got him!

8281
06:48:20,130 --> 06:48:20,690
Where'd he go?

8282
06:48:21,530 --> 06:48:22,530
I'm losing track of him.

8283
06:48:31,280 --> 06:48:31,940
Oh my gosh.

8284
06:48:34,140 --> 06:48:36,440
Oh yeah baby!

8285
06:48:39,300 --> 06:48:40,500
Ouch!

8286
06:48:52,330 --> 06:48:55,410
You bastard!

8287
06:48:56,590 --> 06:48:57,430
A grenade?

8288
06:48:59,730 --> 06:49:01,150
Oh my god.

8289
06:49:01,330 --> 06:49:04,030
Oh I'm out of ammo!

8290
06:49:04,850 --> 06:49:05,450
Shoot.

8291
06:49:05,630 --> 06:49:06,870
I'm out of ammo.

8292
06:49:16,180 --> 06:49:16,520
Sorry.

8293
06:49:17,760 --> 06:49:19,920
I forgot what I needed to do.

8294
06:49:20,700 --> 06:49:21,040
Okay.

8295
06:49:21,040 --> 06:49:22,760
Let's do... AK.

8296
06:49:23,520 --> 06:49:23,860
Baby.

8297
06:49:26,120 --> 06:49:26,900
Oh I see him.

8298
06:49:34,920 --> 06:49:35,460
Oh my god!

8299
06:49:35,540 --> 06:49:35,840
No!

8300
06:49:35,920 --> 06:49:36,100
No!

8301
06:49:36,160 --> 06:49:36,280
No!

8302
06:49:36,320 --> 06:49:36,400
No!

8303
06:49:37,180 --> 06:49:38,100
Oh my god!

8304
06:49:38,140 --> 06:49:38,520
Oh my god!

8305
06:49:38,540 --> 06:49:38,840
Oh my god!

8306
06:49:39,120 --> 06:49:40,120
How did we...

8307
06:49:42,320 --> 06:49:42,640
Okay.

8308
06:49:42,700 --> 06:49:43,500
I'm gonna have to keep it on.

8309
06:49:43,580 --> 06:49:43,940
I'm sorry guys.

8310
06:49:47,680 --> 06:49:48,000
OUCH!!

8311
06:49:49,460 --> 06:49:50,280
Where are you?

8312
06:49:50,360 --> 06:49:50,660
Where are you?

8313
06:49:50,700 --> 06:49:51,040
Where are you?

8314
06:49:51,420 --> 06:49:52,000
Where are you?

8315
06:49:52,060 --> 06:49:52,320
Fuck.

8316
06:49:57,460 --> 06:49:59,160
I feel like I'm gonna die you guys.

8317
06:50:00,000 --> 06:50:01,040
I feel like I'm gonna die.

8318
06:50:02,820 --> 06:50:04,780
I can't... I need to heal faster.

8319
06:50:05,760 --> 06:50:06,080
Um.

8320
06:50:12,730 --> 06:50:14,050
I'm going to eat a calorie meat.

8321
06:50:18,170 --> 06:50:19,950
He said dodge, he didn't dodge.

8322
06:50:20,130 --> 06:50:21,390
I was trying to find him.

8323
06:50:21,810 --> 06:50:23,170
I don't know where to dodge.

8324
06:50:23,230 --> 06:50:24,870
How can I dodge if I don't know where to dodge?

8325
06:50:28,170 --> 06:50:30,430
Oh wait, what is the LF Med?

8326
06:50:32,230 --> 06:50:32,770
What's that?

8327
06:50:33,130 --> 06:50:34,090
Wait, what's that?

8328
06:50:40,660 --> 06:50:41,840
Where do you guys even say that?

8329
06:50:43,060 --> 06:50:43,780
In the backpack.

8330
06:50:48,980 --> 06:50:49,900
It's an idol.

8331
06:50:51,320 --> 06:50:52,540
When did I get this?

8332
06:50:52,600 --> 06:50:53,140
Wait.

8333
06:50:54,860 --> 06:50:56,080
Like the life medicine?

8334
06:51:05,570 --> 06:51:07,010
Oh my gosh.

8335
06:51:08,270 --> 06:51:10,970
I kept thinking this was the revival pill.

8336
06:51:14,020 --> 06:51:16,280
Wait, I thought...

8337
06:51:16,280 --> 06:51:19,660
Because it's like, oh yeah, it brings you back to life.

8338
06:51:25,310 --> 06:51:26,950
Okay, goodbye cigar.

8339
06:51:32,960 --> 06:51:33,660
Life medicine.

8340
06:51:35,480 --> 06:51:36,240
Let's try it out.

8341
06:51:37,140 --> 06:51:39,120
I'm scared though, because he does a lot of damage.

8342
06:51:40,780 --> 06:51:41,500
No, no, no.

8343
06:51:42,460 --> 06:51:42,840
Oh

8344
06:51:46,320 --> 06:51:46,920
my gosh.

8345
06:51:48,680 --> 06:51:50,600
To be fair, life medicine sounds like a revival.

8346
06:51:52,680 --> 06:51:53,060
Okay.

8347
06:51:54,280 --> 06:51:54,660
Shoot.

8348
06:51:55,560 --> 06:51:56,680
That's not what I wanted to do.

8349
06:51:57,580 --> 06:51:58,300
Where are you?

8350
06:51:58,660 --> 06:52:00,640
Oh my god, how did that get me?

8351
06:52:01,220 --> 06:52:03,260
No way, I was behind the tree.

8352
06:52:04,320 --> 06:52:07,340
Are you kidding me?

8353
06:52:07,400 --> 06:52:09,260
I just used my thing.

8354
06:52:11,680 --> 06:52:12,320
Wait.

8355
06:52:13,460 --> 06:52:14,740
I just...

8356
06:52:15,640 --> 06:52:19,980
I just used my life medicine and you do this to me.

8357
06:52:22,240 --> 06:52:23,500
Oh, I got to get it out.

8358
06:52:33,650 --> 06:52:39,290
It's hard to go from this to getting my bearings back to him.

8359
06:52:39,390 --> 06:52:41,850
I think that's the issue I'm having with him.

8360
06:52:44,230 --> 06:52:44,750
Okay.

8361
06:52:48,050 --> 06:52:49,490
Are you feeling the fear, Vito?

8362
06:52:49,570 --> 06:52:50,470
Yeah, I'm feeling the fear.

8363
06:52:51,370 --> 06:52:52,710
I'm feeling the fear.

8364
06:52:53,210 --> 06:52:54,450
I'm feeling the fear.

8365
06:52:55,310 --> 06:52:57,590
I just got to get him a few more times.

8366
06:52:59,750 --> 06:53:00,890
A little bit more.

8367
06:53:04,910 --> 06:53:05,830
I can't move.

8368
06:53:05,990 --> 06:53:06,630
That's an issue.

8369
06:53:06,730 --> 06:53:10,330
I can't move around too much because there's so many traps in this one.

8370
06:53:10,930 --> 06:53:12,330
There's so many traps here.

8371
06:53:12,510 --> 06:53:13,330
It's not even fair.

8372
06:53:14,330 --> 06:53:15,050
There's traps.

8373
06:53:15,210 --> 06:53:17,070
Maybe I should have gotten rid of them.

8374
06:53:17,170 --> 06:53:19,290
Could I have gotten rid of them before I got here?

8375
06:53:19,790 --> 06:53:20,910
I never thought about that.

8376
06:53:21,990 --> 06:53:23,090
Glad to see you playing this game.

8377
06:53:23,310 --> 06:53:24,650
Been a fan of yours a long time.

8378
06:53:24,750 --> 06:53:25,910
This is my first donation.

8379
06:53:25,910 --> 06:53:26,570
Thank you.

8380
06:53:26,890 --> 06:53:28,270
Hope you have an amazing future in streaming.

8381
06:53:28,390 --> 06:53:29,070
Thank you so much.

8382
06:53:30,210 --> 06:53:30,670
Thank you.

8383
06:53:30,770 --> 06:53:30,990
Thank you.

8384
06:53:31,110 --> 06:53:32,130
I think they respawn.

8385
06:53:34,050 --> 06:53:34,450
Lame.

8386
06:53:35,230 --> 06:53:35,630
Lame.

8387
06:53:35,650 --> 06:53:35,850
Lame.

8388
06:53:35,850 --> 06:53:36,070
Lame.

8389
06:53:36,290 --> 06:53:36,690
Okay.

8390
06:53:37,170 --> 06:53:38,110
I know where...

8391
06:53:38,110 --> 06:53:39,610
I thought I knew where...

8392
06:53:39,610 --> 06:53:39,730
Okay.

8393
06:53:47,160 --> 06:53:47,560
Oh.

8394
06:53:48,980 --> 06:53:49,380
Oh.

8395
06:53:49,940 --> 06:53:50,340
Where...

8396
06:53:50,920 --> 06:53:51,800
What is he doing?

8397
06:53:52,140 --> 06:53:52,540
What?

8398
06:53:53,360 --> 06:53:54,040
Where is he?

8399
06:53:56,300 --> 06:53:56,700
Damn.

8400
06:53:57,320 --> 06:53:57,720
Oh.

8401
06:53:59,540 --> 06:54:00,480
It's my turn.

8402
06:54:05,510 --> 06:54:06,930
Oh, he's so close.

8403
06:54:10,520 --> 06:54:11,320
Wait.

8404
06:54:11,440 --> 06:54:11,660
Oh.

8405
06:54:11,740 --> 06:54:11,900
Shit.

8406
06:54:15,640 --> 06:54:16,920
I'm just...

8407
06:54:18,420 --> 06:54:19,220
Spry

8408
06:54:26,540 --> 06:54:26,840
babies!

8409
06:54:27,140 --> 06:54:28,240
Spry on Spry!

8410
06:54:33,220 --> 06:54:34,560
The fear!

8411
06:54:35,580 --> 06:54:35,720
The fear!

8412
06:54:35,720 --> 06:54:36,600
The fear!

8413
06:54:37,060 --> 06:54:37,600
The fear!

8414
06:54:37,900 --> 06:54:38,840
I see it!

8415
06:54:38,880 --> 06:54:39,900
The fear!

8416
06:54:40,240 --> 06:54:40,740
The fear!

8417
06:54:41,520 --> 06:54:45,300
I see it!

8418
06:54:53,780 --> 06:54:55,720
Why was he filled with arrows?

8419
06:55:09,460 --> 06:55:12,660
Everybody, that should be a new party trick for funerals.

8420
06:55:12,720 --> 06:55:17,460
When you die, fill your body with arrows.

8421
06:55:18,120 --> 06:55:25,420
And then, when your family has the funeral, just say, SURPRISE!

8422
06:55:32,200 --> 06:55:37,660
Looks like the fear spent too much of his own Brazilian wandering spider venom.

8423
06:55:37,920 --> 06:55:38,820
Yeah, I did.

8424
06:55:39,460 --> 06:55:40,660
Oh, there's the bunny.

8425
06:55:44,880 --> 06:55:50,180
Defeats... like a super spider man cannot defeat a little bunny.

8426
06:55:50,800 --> 06:55:51,280
Okay.

8427
06:55:51,500 --> 06:55:53,360
I got a serum for that too!

8428
06:55:54,680 --> 06:55:55,160
Interesting.

8429
06:55:57,180 --> 06:55:58,340
Interesting, interesting, interesting.

8430
06:56:01,000 --> 06:56:02,420
Are there still booby traps?

8431
06:56:02,780 --> 06:56:03,380
I'm scared.

8432
06:56:08,280 --> 06:56:09,580
Are there still booby traps?

8433
06:56:11,680 --> 06:56:16,760
You could be an unhinged weirdo, jumping around, climbing trees, saying anything you want, so long as you're good at your job.

8434
06:56:17,540 --> 06:56:18,780
Yeah, so true.

8435
06:56:19,780 --> 06:56:20,760
Okay, be careful.

8436
06:56:22,120 --> 06:56:23,500
He probably ate a frog!

8437
06:56:23,980 --> 06:56:24,360
Idiot!

8438
06:56:24,420 --> 06:56:29,540
Oh, maybe because I killed a frog, he was like, yummy, and then he ate it, and then he was just like...

8439
06:56:30,520 --> 06:56:31,820
I can get that bird.

8440
06:56:32,040 --> 06:56:33,260
You guys, I can get this bird.

8441
06:56:41,790 --> 06:56:42,330
Got him.

8442
06:56:47,010 --> 06:56:48,270
I got that bird.

8443
06:56:56,460 --> 06:56:58,760
And there's another magazine!

8444
06:56:59,300 --> 06:57:00,100
Let's take it.

8445
06:57:02,680 --> 06:57:03,880
Was the shotgun necessary?

8446
06:57:17,960 --> 06:57:19,340
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.

8447
06:57:21,740 --> 06:57:23,220
I think I have to go this way.

8448
06:57:26,660 --> 06:57:29,700
To go back to the place that we came from.

8449
06:57:34,930 --> 06:57:36,050
What is that trap?

8450
06:57:41,680 --> 06:57:42,200
Hello?

8451
06:57:45,740 --> 06:57:48,500
If you walk through this trap a...

8452
06:57:50,320 --> 06:57:51,000
Huh?

8453
06:57:53,640 --> 06:57:57,060
A rope will give you a bump on your head.

8454
06:58:07,440 --> 06:58:08,800
A sausage.

8455
06:58:10,360 --> 06:58:11,480
That's here too.

8456
06:58:12,360 --> 06:58:14,360
Wait, I saw it.

8457
06:58:14,420 --> 06:58:15,100
I swear.

8458
06:58:16,480 --> 06:58:17,160
There!

8459
06:58:17,460 --> 06:58:19,200
But when I turn around...

8460
06:58:19,720 --> 06:58:20,400
It's gone.

8461
06:58:21,980 --> 06:58:22,980
It's a ghost.

8462
06:58:26,300 --> 06:58:27,040
It's a ghost.

8463
06:58:27,500 --> 06:58:28,160
Kero-tan!

8464
06:58:28,480 --> 06:58:29,840
Oh my gosh, I found him.

8465
06:58:33,120 --> 06:58:33,880
Ghost rope.

8466
06:58:36,700 --> 06:58:39,100
How do I get back up here?

8467
06:58:41,480 --> 06:58:41,920
Boy.

8468
06:58:43,180 --> 06:58:43,620
I

8469
06:58:46,720 --> 06:58:48,500
thought about that too when we were like...

8470
06:58:48,500 --> 06:58:49,160
Coming here.

8471
06:58:51,380 --> 06:58:52,620
That's north where you came from?

8472
06:58:52,660 --> 06:58:53,000
Go south?

8473
06:58:53,380 --> 06:58:54,080
Oh, are you sure?

8474
06:58:54,900 --> 06:58:55,340
Oh.

8475
06:59:00,450 --> 06:59:00,890
Okay.

8476
06:59:04,810 --> 06:59:05,570
Okay.

8477
06:59:05,670 --> 06:59:06,890
I believe you.

8478
06:59:09,470 --> 06:59:10,490
Okie dokie.

8479
06:59:11,810 --> 06:59:12,830
I'm stalking.

8480
06:59:12,870 --> 06:59:13,870
So I don't...

8481
06:59:13,870 --> 06:59:15,290
You know.

8482
06:59:16,190 --> 06:59:20,350
So I don't meet an unsatisfactory fate.

8483
06:59:20,570 --> 06:59:21,150
Oh my gosh.

8484
06:59:21,710 --> 06:59:22,470
Rope.

8485
06:59:23,050 --> 06:59:24,410
I'm stalking.

8486
06:59:24,850 --> 06:59:26,250
I'm stalking.

8487
06:59:28,590 --> 06:59:29,850
I'm stalking.

8488
06:59:31,270 --> 06:59:32,030
Okay.

8489
06:59:32,030 --> 06:59:33,070
Oh!

8490
06:59:35,030 --> 06:59:35,790
There it is.

8491
06:59:39,230 --> 06:59:39,770
Alright.

8492
06:59:40,770 --> 06:59:41,890
Let's get our...

8493
06:59:41,890 --> 06:59:42,810
inventory ready again.

8494
06:59:44,750 --> 06:59:46,030
I am going to be...

8495
06:59:46,030 --> 06:59:46,550
ending...

8496
06:59:47,590 --> 06:59:48,130
soon.

8497
06:59:51,070 --> 06:59:51,950
We go...

8498
06:59:51,950 --> 06:59:52,570
through...

8499
06:59:53,130 --> 06:59:55,930
Like I said, I don't want to get to the end.

8500
06:59:56,390 --> 06:59:57,610
The boss, the end.

8501
06:59:58,630 --> 06:59:59,910
Once I go through the...

8502
06:59:59,910 --> 07:00:01,030
door in the other place.

8503
07:00:01,050 --> 07:00:03,250
Is that the key?

8504
07:00:03,410 --> 07:00:04,590
Is that where he's at?

8505
07:00:06,550 --> 07:00:08,070
You said you were ending three hours ago.

8506
07:00:08,150 --> 07:00:08,370
No!

8507
07:00:08,710 --> 07:00:09,950
I said if I...

8508
07:00:09,950 --> 07:00:12,070
I said about my...

8509
07:00:14,290 --> 07:00:14,690
My...

8510
07:00:14,690 --> 07:00:15,330
What's it called?

8511
07:00:20,390 --> 07:00:21,170
My save.

8512
07:00:21,550 --> 07:00:22,330
If it didn't work.

8513
07:00:22,650 --> 07:00:23,370
But it worked.

8514
07:00:25,410 --> 07:00:26,430
Yes, but there's a buffer area.

8515
07:00:26,590 --> 07:00:26,730
Okay.

8516
07:00:26,770 --> 07:00:26,910
Okay.

8517
07:00:26,930 --> 07:00:27,050
Okay.

8518
07:00:27,390 --> 07:00:29,030
You go through the door and then another...

8519
07:00:29,030 --> 07:00:29,450
Okay, perfect.

8520
07:00:29,610 --> 07:00:30,490
We'll go through the door.

8521
07:00:30,790 --> 07:00:31,550
And I'll save.

8522
07:00:31,770 --> 07:00:32,790
And it'll hopefully...

8523
07:00:32,790 --> 07:00:33,110
work.

8524
07:00:33,410 --> 07:00:34,710
And if not, I'll just leave it on.

8525
07:00:34,790 --> 07:00:36,570
And I'll go find my other...

8526
07:00:36,950 --> 07:00:37,310
Um...

8527
07:00:39,250 --> 07:00:39,770
What's it called?

8528
07:00:39,870 --> 07:00:40,630
My other...

8529
07:00:41,710 --> 07:00:42,070
Thing.

8530
07:00:42,130 --> 07:00:42,810
But we will...

8531
07:00:42,810 --> 07:00:43,950
go defeat that guy.

8532
07:00:48,930 --> 07:00:49,950
Thank you, my show.

8533
07:00:53,090 --> 07:00:53,770
Memory card.

8534
07:00:54,330 --> 07:00:54,690
Yeah.

8535
07:00:55,330 --> 07:00:55,690
Sorry.

8536
07:00:55,850 --> 07:00:57,190
You guys, I'm not articulate...

8537
07:00:57,190 --> 07:00:57,570
at all.

8538
07:00:57,590 --> 07:00:58,550
I can't ever think of anything.

8539
07:00:59,970 --> 07:01:01,470
I can't ever think of words.

8540
07:01:01,630 --> 07:01:02,710
Words are so difficult.

8541
07:01:05,890 --> 07:01:07,230
Words are so hard.

8542
07:01:15,530 --> 07:01:16,050
Munchies!

8543
07:01:25,870 --> 07:01:27,050
Oh my god.

8544
07:01:27,090 --> 07:01:27,990
They're desperate for food.

8545
07:01:31,270 --> 07:01:32,750
They're desperate for food!

8546
07:01:34,030 --> 07:01:34,710
Munchies!

8547
07:01:34,870 --> 07:01:35,650
What is he eating?

8548
07:01:36,210 --> 07:01:37,490
Don't take my food.

8549
07:01:44,050 --> 07:01:44,730
Munchies!

8550
07:01:44,950 --> 07:01:45,930
Wait, I can't move.

8551
07:01:46,150 --> 07:01:46,830
Snake.

8552
07:01:47,790 --> 07:01:49,510
Just crawl forward.

8553
07:01:49,890 --> 07:01:50,430
There we go.

8554
07:01:53,810 --> 07:01:54,490
Munchies!

8555
07:01:57,510 --> 07:01:58,190
Munchies!

8556
07:01:58,490 --> 07:01:59,570
I'm so hungry.

8557
07:02:02,150 --> 07:02:04,370
This is so sad!

8558
07:02:05,950 --> 07:02:06,490
No!

8559
07:02:08,530 --> 07:02:10,030
This is so sad!

8560
07:02:15,370 --> 07:02:16,450
This is so sad!

8561
07:02:16,450 --> 07:02:18,790
I destroyed all their food and now they're starving!

8562
07:02:20,410 --> 07:02:23,140
I destroyed all their food and now they're starving!

8563
07:02:23,140 --> 07:02:23,860
Let me...

8564
07:02:23,860 --> 07:02:25,220
Let me change.

8565
07:02:25,360 --> 07:02:26,080
See if I can...

8566
07:02:26,080 --> 07:02:27,280
change my camel.

8567
07:02:30,800 --> 07:02:31,760
Oh, splitter.

8568
07:02:33,160 --> 07:02:34,440
I like the splitter one.

8569
07:02:34,480 --> 07:02:35,780
I think I like the splitter one the most.

8570
07:02:40,380 --> 07:02:41,880
Give them my poisonous dart.

8571
07:02:42,140 --> 07:02:42,160
Give them my poisonous dart.

8572
07:02:42,160 --> 07:02:42,860
Oh yeah, you're right.

8573
07:02:44,200 --> 07:02:44,720
Munchies!

8574
07:02:47,380 --> 07:02:47,900
Munchies!

8575
07:02:50,940 --> 07:02:51,460
Munchies!

8576
07:02:54,060 --> 07:02:55,100
This poor...

8577
07:02:55,100 --> 07:02:55,960
This poor...

8578
07:02:55,960 --> 07:02:57,060
Poor group of guys, man.

8579
07:03:05,580 --> 07:03:06,920
If I throw it...

8580
07:03:06,920 --> 07:03:08,340
Well, wait, my poison dart...

8581
07:03:08,340 --> 07:03:10,300
Wait, I can't throw it though.

8582
07:03:10,300 --> 07:03:11,800
Because it's not...

8583
07:03:12,400 --> 07:03:13,560
alive, right?

8584
07:03:13,900 --> 07:03:14,580
Wait, hold on.

8585
07:03:16,740 --> 07:03:17,140
Yeah.

8586
07:03:17,900 --> 07:03:19,400
I can only dispose of him, right?

8587
07:03:25,340 --> 07:03:26,360
There's that guy there.

8588
07:03:26,660 --> 07:03:27,240
Okay, hold on.

8589
07:03:30,630 --> 07:03:33,170
I don't want him to see that other dude I just took out.

8590
07:03:33,850 --> 07:03:34,370
I don't want him to see that other dude I just took out.

8591
07:03:34,370 --> 07:03:34,890
Hold on, there we go.

8592
07:03:43,000 --> 07:03:43,800
Hold on.

8593
07:03:44,240 --> 07:03:44,900
Please shoot!

8594
07:03:45,380 --> 07:03:46,020
There we go.

8595
07:03:46,100 --> 07:03:46,560
My gosh.

8596
07:03:47,200 --> 07:03:48,540
Sometimes the trigger...

8597
07:03:48,540 --> 07:03:49,540
is so cruel to me.

8598
07:03:50,680 --> 07:03:51,980
Or the controller.

8599
07:03:54,220 --> 07:03:55,940
Okay, so I know there's a guy...

8600
07:03:57,060 --> 07:03:58,000
over here.

8601
07:04:00,180 --> 07:04:01,320
Are you the hungry guy?

8602
07:04:01,540 --> 07:04:02,640
Are you the hungry, hungry hippo?

8603
07:04:10,080 --> 07:04:11,000
No, no, no!

8604
07:04:11,180 --> 07:04:11,440
Fuck!

8605
07:04:11,680 --> 07:04:12,160
Shit!

8606
07:04:12,200 --> 07:04:13,160
I let go!

8607
07:04:13,800 --> 07:04:14,880
Oh my god.

8608
07:04:14,900 --> 07:04:16,040
I let go, for real.

8609
07:04:16,280 --> 07:04:17,480
This is so cruel!

8610
07:04:17,480 --> 07:04:19,360
This damn...

8611
07:04:19,360 --> 07:04:20,320
controller sometimes!

8612
07:04:20,920 --> 07:04:23,040
It's so sticky, I swear!

8613
07:04:36,690 --> 07:04:37,250
Yes!

8614
07:04:37,490 --> 07:04:38,250
Stay down!

8615
07:04:40,930 --> 07:04:41,490
Gosh!

8616
07:04:46,920 --> 07:04:49,680
Was there anybody... there was another guy, wasn't there?

8617
07:04:51,080 --> 07:04:52,040
Over that way?

8618
07:04:52,160 --> 07:04:52,900
In front of the door?

8619
07:04:53,900 --> 07:04:55,740
I'm almost positive there is.

8620
07:05:10,620 --> 07:05:11,740
Unless he's just not...

8621
07:05:11,740 --> 07:05:12,560
going around.

8622
07:05:14,100 --> 07:05:14,900
Yeah, paused.

8623
07:05:25,100 --> 07:05:25,980
Can't see him though.

8624
07:05:26,140 --> 07:05:26,680
I don't know.

8625
07:05:35,090 --> 07:05:37,010
They showed a guy in front of the door...

8626
07:05:37,010 --> 07:05:38,390
but it could've just been for dramatic effect.

8627
07:05:38,630 --> 07:05:39,230
Can't remember.

8628
07:05:40,030 --> 07:05:41,210
I guess that's it.

8629
07:05:41,310 --> 07:05:41,810
Okay, cool.

8630
07:05:43,450 --> 07:05:44,990
Food in the weapon section for throwing?

8631
07:05:45,170 --> 07:05:45,630
Oh, okay.

8632
07:05:49,360 --> 07:05:50,840
Sorry guys, sometimes I'm looking at...

8633
07:05:50,840 --> 07:05:52,540
the game and I'm not looking at chat.

8634
07:05:52,760 --> 07:05:54,220
If you're just like trying to tell me something.

8635
07:05:57,380 --> 07:05:57,780
Sometimes...

8636
07:05:58,500 --> 07:05:58,900
I'm...

8637
07:06:00,940 --> 07:06:01,700
I'm gaming.

8638
07:06:02,180 --> 07:06:02,580
Sometimes.

8639
07:06:03,440 --> 07:06:04,380
You know how it is.

8640
07:06:04,620 --> 07:06:05,740
You know how it is, right?

8641
07:06:05,820 --> 07:06:06,600
When you're like gaming.

8642
07:06:09,500 --> 07:06:11,040
Are the control sticks and buttons...

8643
07:06:11,040 --> 07:06:11,820
getting weirdly sticky?

8644
07:06:12,060 --> 07:06:12,840
Like, rotting away?

8645
07:06:13,140 --> 07:06:14,060
Oh, I hope not.

8646
07:06:14,700 --> 07:06:16,640
I don't... I don't sure hope not.

8647
07:06:18,100 --> 07:06:19,160
Come on, get the crab!

8648
07:06:19,300 --> 07:06:19,800
Get the crab!

8649
07:06:24,800 --> 07:06:25,960
Oh, my food is full?

8650
07:06:26,080 --> 07:06:26,840
Oh, I thought I was hungry.

8651
07:06:27,280 --> 07:06:27,900
Just kidding.

8652
07:06:29,180 --> 07:06:30,020
Okay, you know what?

8653
07:06:30,020 --> 07:06:30,340
Let's just go.

8654
07:06:40,170 --> 07:06:41,230
I'm still weary.

8655
07:06:43,490 --> 07:06:44,330
Just kidding.

8656
07:06:45,050 --> 07:06:45,670
All good.

8657
07:06:46,190 --> 07:06:46,950
Crab battle.

8658
07:06:47,710 --> 07:06:48,130
Serum.

8659
07:06:49,550 --> 07:06:49,970
Antidote.

8660
07:06:49,970 --> 07:06:50,890
Good, good, good, good.

8661
07:06:59,780 --> 07:07:00,200
Alright.

8662
07:07:00,200 --> 07:07:01,240
Th...

8663
07:07:05,010 --> 07:07:05,550
Gordon...

8664
07:07:08,370 --> 07:07:08,910
Alright.

8665
07:07:14,210 --> 07:07:15,130
Okie dokie.

8666
07:07:15,250 --> 07:07:17,050
Now I can save.

8667
07:07:19,450 --> 07:07:19,990
Okay.

8668
07:07:20,190 --> 07:07:21,070
Yeah, it's time to...

8669
07:07:21,070 --> 07:07:21,310
Oops.

8670
07:07:21,590 --> 07:07:24,110
No, I think I'm good.

8671
07:07:24,270 --> 07:07:24,910
Thank you.

8672
07:07:26,850 --> 07:07:28,170
Thank you, Major.

8673
07:07:28,370 --> 07:07:28,890
Thank you.

8674
07:07:29,150 --> 07:07:30,050
Thank you, Major.

8675
07:07:30,270 --> 07:07:30,830
Thank you.

8676
07:07:32,450 --> 07:07:33,730
Do you want to save?

8677
07:07:35,230 --> 07:07:35,770
Yes.

8678
07:07:35,910 --> 07:07:37,810
Yes, but I'm scared, paramedic, please.

8679
07:07:39,690 --> 07:07:40,550
Paramedic, I'm scared.

8680
07:07:40,670 --> 07:07:41,870
I'm scared, paramedic.

8681
07:07:42,230 --> 07:07:43,370
Paramedic, I'm scared!

8682
07:07:43,470 --> 07:07:44,650
I'm scared, paramedic!

8683
07:07:52,100 --> 07:07:54,060
I'm scared, paramedic.

8684
07:07:54,060 --> 07:07:54,800
I'm scared.

8685
07:07:54,860 --> 07:07:55,220
I'm scared.

8686
07:07:59,520 --> 07:08:00,040
Yippee!

8687
07:08:00,820 --> 07:08:03,240
Snake, have you seen the movie Them?

8688
07:08:03,320 --> 07:08:03,720
Then.

8689
07:08:03,960 --> 07:08:04,480
No.

8690
07:08:05,040 --> 07:08:07,560
It's about these giant ants Oh, my God.

8691
07:08:07,580 --> 07:08:09,320
She loves monster movies.

8692
07:08:09,440 --> 07:08:09,600
after a nuclear test.

8693
07:08:11,020 --> 07:08:12,580
She tries to fight them off with flamethrowers.

8694
07:08:13,380 --> 07:08:16,280
The ants were so big that they filled up the entire screen.

8695
07:08:16,560 --> 07:08:18,180
The whole movie theater was screaming.

8696
07:08:18,920 --> 07:08:21,160
An ant that big could make a good meal.

8697
07:08:21,960 --> 07:08:22,360
Yeah.

8698
07:08:22,460 --> 07:08:24,560
Well, if you find any, don't eat them.

8699
07:08:25,000 --> 07:08:25,760
Come on.

8700
07:08:25,760 --> 07:08:26,960
They're not that bad for you.

8701
07:08:27,160 --> 07:08:27,320
Yay!

8702
07:08:27,380 --> 07:08:30,800
If you end up growing huge like that, you won't have any place left to hide.

8703
07:08:31,220 --> 07:08:32,360
Just like a girlagon.

8704
07:08:32,920 --> 07:08:34,280
What is a... a what?

8705
07:08:34,940 --> 07:08:35,740
A girlagon?

8706
07:08:37,020 --> 07:08:38,120
Snake, what the hell is that?

8707
07:08:38,120 --> 07:08:38,280
What is that?

8708
07:08:42,510 --> 07:08:42,950
Alrighty.

8709
07:08:43,210 --> 07:08:45,070
So, when we come back...

8710
07:08:46,950 --> 07:08:49,170
Maybe next week I'll do a mid-day...

8711
07:08:49,170 --> 07:08:50,850
No, I'll do it on Saturday.

8712
07:08:51,550 --> 07:08:52,150
No, wait.

8713
07:08:52,330 --> 07:08:53,010
I can't do it...

8714
07:08:53,010 --> 07:08:54,810
I'll probably do a mid-day Metal Gear.

8715
07:08:55,690 --> 07:08:57,070
Or like a mid-week, rather.

8716
07:08:57,250 --> 07:08:58,490
Mid-week Metal Gear.

8717
07:08:58,790 --> 07:08:59,530
Next week.

8718
07:09:02,510 --> 07:09:02,950
So...

8719
07:09:03,910 --> 07:09:06,990
Probably like the day after I celebrate my birthday.

8720
07:09:06,990 --> 07:09:09,120
I'm gonna be celebrating my birthday on...

8721
07:09:10,070 --> 07:09:11,150
October 2nd.

8722
07:09:11,150 --> 07:09:12,290
My birthday's on the 1st.

8723
07:09:12,350 --> 07:09:14,030
But I'm gonna be celebrating on the 2nd.

8724
07:09:14,050 --> 07:09:15,110
I have announcements.

8725
07:09:15,430 --> 07:09:16,070
I have...

8726
07:09:17,030 --> 07:09:18,130
Well, announcement.

8727
07:09:18,950 --> 07:09:20,050
I have an announcement.

8728
07:09:20,990 --> 07:09:21,530
So...

8729
07:09:23,570 --> 07:09:29,450
If you are so inclined to come celebrate my birthday with me and some friends...

8730
07:09:29,450 --> 07:09:31,030
I think it'll be a fun time.

8731
07:09:31,210 --> 07:09:35,010
I worked really hard on getting stuff set up for it.

8732
07:09:35,130 --> 07:09:36,130
I'm not quite done.

8733
07:09:36,990 --> 07:09:40,910
So actually, right after the stream, I'm gonna be working and recording stuff more.

8734
07:09:41,230 --> 07:09:41,590
So...

8735
07:09:41,590 --> 07:09:43,190
It is a good announcement.

8736
07:09:44,550 --> 07:09:45,610
I'm very excited.

8737
07:09:47,250 --> 07:09:48,110
So, yeah.

8738
07:09:48,190 --> 07:09:48,810
It's a good announcement.

8739
07:09:48,990 --> 07:09:50,430
No worries, no worries, no worries.

8740
07:09:51,350 --> 07:09:52,430
No worries at all.

8741
07:09:52,950 --> 07:09:53,810
Zero worries.

8742
07:09:53,910 --> 07:09:55,670
In fact, be hype for it, please.

8743
07:09:58,130 --> 07:09:58,910
Please clap.

8744
07:10:01,610 --> 07:10:04,410
Please buy or use a new PS2 memory card.

8745
07:10:04,570 --> 07:10:05,310
Yes, I will.

8746
07:10:06,990 --> 07:10:09,050
Make sure that there's...

8747
07:10:09,050 --> 07:10:12,990
Or not make sure, but I will try a different memory card next stream so that...

8748
07:10:13,510 --> 07:10:18,630
Actually, probably, I'm just gonna leave it like this and save this save onto the next new memory card.

8749
07:10:20,090 --> 07:10:23,750
So I'm gonna go find it and do all that good stuff.

8750
07:10:24,730 --> 07:10:26,870
Yeah, I was feeling a little under the weather today.

8751
07:10:27,150 --> 07:10:28,690
No, I feel better!

8752
07:10:30,030 --> 07:10:30,710
Feel better.

8753
07:10:30,790 --> 07:10:34,310
I probably will go out and buy a new memory card as well.

8754
07:10:34,310 --> 07:10:35,850
Oh my gosh, I wonder if I can get one in Japan.

8755
07:10:36,130 --> 07:10:37,670
You think that basic is so expensive?

8756
07:10:38,730 --> 07:10:39,130
Hmm...

8757
07:10:41,690 --> 07:10:44,170
This week, I am going back to Japan.

8758
07:10:45,910 --> 07:10:47,150
It's not a very long trip.

8759
07:10:47,350 --> 07:10:48,370
I'm going to TGS.

8760
07:10:48,690 --> 07:10:49,490
Tokyo Game Show.

8761
07:10:49,850 --> 07:10:55,790
So, yes, I will be attempting to try the demo of Delta.

8762
07:10:56,810 --> 07:11:00,590
Yes, I will tell you guys all about it if I can try and all that fun stuff.

8763
07:11:02,170 --> 07:11:02,570
And...

8764
07:11:03,390 --> 07:11:03,790
And...

8765
07:11:04,310 --> 07:11:04,950
Yeah.

8766
07:11:05,810 --> 07:11:06,570
So...

8767
07:11:07,950 --> 07:11:11,290
You can get Minto's first-hand experience.

8768
07:11:12,130 --> 07:11:14,010
Yeah, I'm trying to get the crawl cards.

8769
07:11:17,810 --> 07:11:19,330
A souvenir?

8770
07:11:22,130 --> 07:11:22,750
Yeah, a souvenir.

8771
07:11:24,850 --> 07:11:26,270
Yeah, so...

8772
07:11:26,270 --> 07:11:32,270
But I will be streaming tomorrow and the day after.

8773
07:11:32,410 --> 07:11:33,350
So Monday, Tuesday.

8774
07:11:34,310 --> 07:11:35,870
And then I will be back...

8775
07:11:37,410 --> 07:11:39,350
I will be back on the 2nd.

8776
07:11:41,370 --> 07:11:42,290
What day is that?

8777
07:11:43,970 --> 07:11:44,850
What day is that?

8778
07:11:45,050 --> 07:11:45,450
Wednesday?

8779
07:11:45,650 --> 07:11:45,910
Yes.

8780
07:11:46,150 --> 07:11:48,090
So basically, gone for a week.

8781
07:11:48,410 --> 07:11:50,710
And then it will be happy tomorrow, right?

8782
07:11:50,790 --> 07:11:52,490
Oh, yes, thank you for reminding me.

8783
07:11:52,570 --> 07:11:53,630
Oh my gosh, Platypus, thank you.

8784
07:11:53,810 --> 07:11:55,350
I have an official happy coat.

8785
07:11:55,550 --> 07:11:57,670
I don't have a picture with me right now, I'm sorry.

8786
07:11:58,770 --> 07:12:01,830
I have an official happy coat that will be starting pre-order tomorrow.

8787
07:12:03,870 --> 07:12:05,330
I have an official happy coat that will be starting pre-order tomorrow.

8788
07:12:06,390 --> 07:12:06,870
But...

8789
07:12:09,350 --> 07:12:12,630
Google says you shouldn't need to worry about region logs on PS2 memory cards.

8790
07:12:12,710 --> 07:12:12,770
Google says you shouldn't need to worry about region logs on PS2 memory cards.

8791
07:12:12,770 --> 07:12:13,250
Oh, okay.

8792
07:12:13,350 --> 07:12:17,290
I was going to actually just look that up right after this.

8793
07:12:17,330 --> 07:12:17,570
I was going to actually just look that up right after this.

8794
07:12:17,570 --> 07:12:18,170
Thank you, Nano.

8795
07:12:20,290 --> 07:12:21,170
Cat approved.

8796
07:12:21,450 --> 07:12:22,370
Yes, it is cat approved.

8797
07:12:22,490 --> 07:12:23,670
It's really, really soft.

8798
07:12:24,610 --> 07:12:27,670
It's quite a soft, sturdy material.

8799
07:12:27,750 --> 07:12:28,590
So it's really nice.

8800
07:12:30,830 --> 07:12:31,730
It's made to order.

8801
07:12:32,230 --> 07:12:33,770
It's not limited stock.

8802
07:12:34,550 --> 07:12:38,010
And the pre-orders, I believe, are open for three weeks?

8803
07:12:38,370 --> 07:12:39,330
I will double-check that.

8804
07:12:41,430 --> 07:12:41,790
Yeah.

8805
07:12:41,990 --> 07:12:43,070
So it's made to order.

8806
07:12:44,350 --> 07:12:48,570
And it won't sell out, so don't worry if you're just like, Oh my gosh, I can't wake up at that time!

8807
07:12:48,670 --> 07:12:49,090
Or whatever.

8808
07:12:49,430 --> 07:12:53,210
Just order within the time period and you'll all be good.

8809
07:12:54,530 --> 07:12:55,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8810
07:12:55,450 --> 07:12:56,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8811
07:12:57,970 --> 07:12:58,410
Um...

8812
07:13:00,550 --> 07:13:03,670
Wait for a week while I have a week off so I can actually catch more livestreams.

8813
07:13:03,750 --> 07:13:05,370
Oh, sorry, Sean!

8814
07:13:07,070 --> 07:13:07,950
Yeah, um...

8815
07:13:08,670 --> 07:13:09,110
Sorry.

8816
07:13:10,430 --> 07:13:14,030
But if you needed to catch up on some Minto streams, you can do that.

8817
07:13:15,170 --> 07:13:16,050
And also...

8818
07:13:16,610 --> 07:13:22,110
Yeah, it should be my last time traveling for like...

8819
07:13:22,110 --> 07:13:25,470
especially to Japan this year.

8820
07:13:27,790 --> 07:13:28,190
Um...

8821
07:13:28,190 --> 07:13:29,770
I have another trip at the end of the year.

8822
07:13:29,890 --> 07:13:30,710
I want to go to Komiket.

8823
07:13:31,970 --> 07:13:33,910
But that's like, basically...

8824
07:13:34,570 --> 07:13:34,970
2025.

8825
07:13:36,570 --> 07:13:36,970
So...

8826
07:13:41,710 --> 07:13:42,730
X to doubt.

8827
07:13:42,830 --> 07:13:43,290
No, please.

8828
07:13:43,910 --> 07:13:45,290
I'm actually so...

8829
07:13:45,790 --> 07:13:47,090
tired of traveling.

8830
07:13:49,530 --> 07:13:51,150
I'm so tired of flying.

8831
07:13:51,490 --> 07:13:52,790
I'm so tired of flying.

8832
07:13:52,910 --> 07:13:53,710
And it's so expensive!

8833
07:13:54,150 --> 07:13:55,290
It's very, very expensive.

8834
07:13:55,370 --> 07:13:56,790
But this is an important trip for me.

8835
07:13:57,050 --> 07:14:01,190
Truly, I really, really wasn't going to go.

8836
07:14:01,670 --> 07:14:02,530
But um...

8837
07:14:03,070 --> 07:14:07,310
an event is happening that's basically forcing me.

8838
07:14:07,430 --> 07:14:08,550
It's forcing my hand.

8839
07:14:08,750 --> 07:14:13,370
It's a last time opportunity ever, ever, ever for this.

8840
07:14:13,470 --> 07:14:14,290
So I have to go.

8841
07:14:15,310 --> 07:14:19,430
And I get to go to TGS as well.

8842
07:14:19,590 --> 07:14:25,370
So I will be filming that and I'll edit that once I'm back and show you guys.

8843
07:14:26,050 --> 07:14:29,210
How fun it was and all the cool stuff that there was.

8844
07:14:29,890 --> 07:14:31,450
Sorry, that sounds so mean.

8845
07:14:31,630 --> 07:14:35,770
I'm going to show you guys how fun this place was and make you sad that you couldn't go.

8846
07:14:35,930 --> 07:14:36,390
No, I'm just kidding.

8847
07:14:38,330 --> 07:14:41,450
This is the double Oshii plus TGS Japan trip, right?

8848
07:14:41,530 --> 07:14:41,870
Yes.

8849
07:14:42,490 --> 07:14:42,890
Yes.

8850
07:14:44,110 --> 07:14:44,830
Yes, yes, yes.

8851
07:14:45,130 --> 07:14:46,250
Double Oshii TGS.

8852
07:14:46,770 --> 07:14:47,170
Yeah.

8853
07:14:50,470 --> 07:14:58,790
But no, if you've never been to TGS too maybe we'll show you kind of a good idea of what it's like as well.

8854
07:14:58,890 --> 07:14:59,570
I've only been once.

8855
07:15:00,170 --> 07:15:02,150
And I went during like the public day.

8856
07:15:05,250 --> 07:15:06,250
It's hellish.

8857
07:15:06,410 --> 07:15:08,010
It's absolutely hellish.

8858
07:15:08,150 --> 07:15:18,450
It's... Honestly, if I could not go to TGS and you know, just watch videos of it, I would.

8859
07:15:24,590 --> 07:15:26,030
It's... I'm not...

8860
07:15:26,650 --> 07:15:27,330
I'm not...

8861
07:15:27,330 --> 07:15:31,290
I'm so scared of the Metal Gear booth.

8862
07:15:31,570 --> 07:15:34,990
I'm actually really terrified of the Metal Gear booth.

8863
07:15:36,010 --> 07:15:42,030
Because it's Delta, like last year it was the it was the Master Collection.

8864
07:15:42,490 --> 07:15:45,570
And those are games that, you know, you could still play.

8865
07:15:45,850 --> 07:15:47,830
This is a brand new Metal Gear game.

8866
07:15:48,070 --> 07:15:49,510
So I'm terrified.

8867
07:15:51,130 --> 07:16:00,450
I'm terrified if I will one, be able to play it because um basically the way they do it is you go up to the booth and they give you a number ticket.

8868
07:16:01,450 --> 07:16:08,350
And that will say like come back between 12pm to 1pm and you can play the game.

8869
07:16:08,470 --> 07:16:10,350
You line up and you play the game between that time slot.

8870
07:16:12,470 --> 07:16:15,690
But they hand them all out at the very beginning of the day.

8871
07:16:15,810 --> 07:16:24,290
So if I get there even like 10 minutes late um it's gonna it could possibly all be out.

8872
07:16:26,450 --> 07:16:30,450
So um I'm going to do my best.

8873
07:16:30,990 --> 07:16:32,070
I'm going to do my best.

8874
07:16:32,170 --> 07:16:35,310
Because I definitely was not able to do the Master Collection last year because of that.

8875
07:16:38,570 --> 07:16:39,010
Yeah.

8876
07:16:41,070 --> 07:16:42,550
Sounds stressful to be honest.

8877
07:16:42,630 --> 07:16:42,970
I know!

8878
07:16:43,590 --> 07:16:50,810
And honestly I'm like I'm like not I'm not saying that I'm not looking forward to it obviously.

8879
07:16:51,070 --> 07:16:53,030
But I'm just nervous about it.

8880
07:16:53,110 --> 07:16:59,670
I've been so nervous I'm just like oh what if I travel all the way there and I don't even get to play it.

8881
07:16:59,850 --> 07:17:00,070
You know?

8882
07:17:00,190 --> 07:17:02,850
So I'm really I'm really nervous about it.

8883
07:17:02,930 --> 07:17:04,930
I'm like what if it will be such a waste.

8884
07:17:05,350 --> 07:17:05,590
Hmm.

8885
07:17:07,770 --> 07:17:09,950

We'll see.

8888
07:17:13,390 --> 07:17:14,310
We'll see how it goes.

8889
07:17:15,190 --> 07:17:15,630
Praying.

8890
07:17:15,670 --> 07:17:16,050

8891
07:17:16,130 --> 07:17:16,370
Praying.

8892
07:17:18,290 --> 07:17:20,710
I especially want to tell you guys all about it too.

8893
07:17:21,090 --> 07:17:29,930
Because I hate those stinky IGN articles or like the load times and it still showed the the What do you mean it's not open world?

8894
07:17:30,130 --> 07:17:33,190

8895
07:17:35,630 --> 07:17:52,650
I don't want some bozo out there being like I played Metal Gear when I was 7 years old and blablabla blablabla Game articles or journalist articles can be negative.

They were right.

8904
07:18:14,970 --> 07:18:17,590
