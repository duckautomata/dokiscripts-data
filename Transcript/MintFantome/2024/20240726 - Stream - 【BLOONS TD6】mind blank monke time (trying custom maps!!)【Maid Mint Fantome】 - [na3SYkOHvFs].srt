1
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,870
Howdy, y'all.

2
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,890
Wait, let me fix some of my setup.

3
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,890
Hello!

4
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,610
Howdy.

5
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,950
Howdy, howdy doody.

6
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,490
I'm at a convention this weekend.

7
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,210
In Texas, y'all.

8
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,750
But not one single person has said that they know Sandy Cheeks.

9
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,290
Weird.

10
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,810
OMG, it's a minto!

11
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,010
It's mint!

12
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,370
It's mint.

13
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,270
Where's the swimsuit?

14
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,750
Okay, for those who don't know...

15
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,830
We were just watching Ayami-sensei's panel.

16
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,110
Where she drew...

17
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,070
She...

18
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,830
She...

19
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,350
She... drew...

20
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:16,990
She... drew... V?

21
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,930
I think...

22
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:20,990
I think...

23
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,330
Maybe Isekai version?

24
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,170
Maybe Isekai version?

25
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,060
I think...

26
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,780
I have a screenshot that I was gonna post on Twitter.

27
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,800
That...

28
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:39,880
That...

29
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,500
That has a funny face that she made too.

30
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:43,620
That has a funny face that she made too.

31
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,540
Just...

32
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:46,880
...

33
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,060
Do you see the resemblance?

34
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,120
...

35
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,660
...

36
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,920
...

37
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,360
...

38
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,960
I finally got a flight out of Long Beach!

39
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,600
No way!

40
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,260
You finally got one!

41
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,740
Oh my gosh, Big Mac.

42
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,680
Oh my gosh.

43
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,620
Please go home.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,520
Please go home.

45
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,060
Who is this?

46
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,620
I'm really in love with the Asuna face she gave me though.

47
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,120
Where did those come from?

48
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,960
I don't know!

49
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,470
Here they are.

50
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,390
My two big bulging...

51
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,950
My eyes are here.

52
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,570
I stand by what I said, even when it wasn't me who said it.

53
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,910
Play MGS5 first everyone for the true experience.

54
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,690
No!

55
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,490
I had a panel even.

56
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,930
I talked about Metal Gear.

57
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,730
I'm saying this is a happy anniversary.

58
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,690
Thank you Luna!

59
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,730
Thank you!

60
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,230
Thank you so much.

61
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,530
You gave me the Wisp plushie, right?

62
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,150
I...

63
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,730
Beat it up every day.

64
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,070
Take out my aggressions, you know?

65
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,010
Homer, I've made my choice.

66
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,150
ViviCore, thank you for the 5 gifted!

67
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,110
And Mdrangles, thank you for the 20 gifted!

68
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,110
And Oddballboy, thank you for the 5 gifted!

69
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,030
Thank you guys!

70
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,630
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

71
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,430
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

72
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,830
She hates us.

73
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,790
Wisp plushie...

74
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,570
Was I supposed to say that?

75
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,550
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

76
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:00,970
Wow, this is...

77
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,910
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

78
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,310
So glad your MGS panel was streamed.

79
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:04,910
It was really fun.

80
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,330
Really?

81
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,530
It wasn't...

82
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,330
It was...

83
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:10,990
I'm glad...

84
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,950
I gave you the Wisp plushie.

85
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,690
Glad you're beating it up.

86
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:12,890
Yeah!

87
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:14,630
Oh my gosh!

88
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,210
I did it!

89
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,350
Happy belated anniversary.

90
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,210
Thank you!

91
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,870
Too much!

92
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,850
That's too much.

93
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,670
Thank you for the 5 gifted!

94
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,190
Thank you!

95
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,160
Minto-chan, good morning!

96
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,160
Good morning!

97
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,420
I'm cursed by EU time zones but happy birthday.

98
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:37,660
No!

99
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm streaming a little early today.

100
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,060
SSR Minto, summer real.

101
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,280
Yeah.

102
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,640
Wait, what's the other S though?

103
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,100
Super summer real.

104
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,220
Super summer real Minto.

105
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,300
Maybe she'll post the finished version.

106
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,740
On Twitter.

107
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,900
Mr. Obvious, thank you for the 20 gifted!

108
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,460
Thank you!

109
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,300
I have a friend who was at the panel.

110
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,260
He had an absolute blast, he said thanks.

111
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
Oh man...

112
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,120
I didn't...

113
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,700
I don't make panels so I didn't really know what to do at all.

114
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,980
I had no idea what to say...

115
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,020
I was like, I can't make this like a...

116
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,660
How...

117
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,300
Know everything about Metal Gear...

118
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,740
like that I just was like...

119
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,600
Well, I'll just talk about Metal Gear and then start to do solo panels.

120
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,280
Yeah, I didn't want to be like, okay, the history of Metal Gear Solid.

121
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,720
I wanted it to be like a little bit more...

122
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,800
A little more silly, I think.

123
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,640
You did well alone?

124
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,680
Okay, I'm glad.

125
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,040
Love the fighting second?

126
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:51,860
Thank you!

127
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,260
I saw it on Twitch, ignoring an important work meeting.

128
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,200
Yeah, it's so much fun.

129
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,680
If you watched it, thank you so much.

130
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:11,620
If not, I believe it might still be on the Anime Fest Dallas Twitch channel.

131
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,620
Metal Gear Scholar.

132
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,540
But today...

133
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,140
How do I get to it, actually?

134
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,240
Wait, I think it's under here.

135
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,410
Edit map?

136
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,350
No, no.

137
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,490
How do I go to the maps?

138
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,430
How do I go to the maps?

139
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,770
Isn't there play?

140
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,730
Community?

141
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,770
I found it!

142
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,210
I found it!

143
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,610
I found it!

144
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,050
I found it!

145
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,910
Today, I would like to play some custom maps.

146
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,630
And, you know...

147
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,150
I kind of... Sorry, I'm super brain empty, you guys.

148
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,370
I'm so...

149
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,910
I'm not burned out.

150
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,650
I think I'm just overworked a little bit.

151
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,510
And I feel like... I feel bad because I'm like, oh gosh...

152
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,710
I'm gonna be brain empty and just playing Bloons every day.

153
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,110
But... Sorry... Sorry for monkey brain.

154
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,430
You guys, I have something to tell you.

155
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,200
I have something to tell you.

156
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,420
I have something to tell you.

157
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,600
In August... Okay, so I go to Otakuton.

158
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,500
And then, like...

159
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
Just a couple days later...

160
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,000
I fly to Japan.

161
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,740
And I'm gonna be in Japan...

162
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,580
For over a month.

163
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,940
It's somehow...

164
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,990
Turned into that.

165
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,950
So basically, I made plans with Mataro.

166
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,030
And then something else came up.

167
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,450
And I thought it was a good opportunity.

168
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,110
So I didn't say no.

169
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,610
But... I'll have all my stuff.

170
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,550
I'll still be streaming.

171
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,190
I will...

172
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,670
Attempting schedules and everything.

173
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,030
So...

174
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,690
I'll still be streaming.

175
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,030
I'm so sorry that my schedules have been...

176
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,950
So...

177
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,650
Not great recently.

178
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:41,570
But...

179
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,750
After September...

180
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,130
After I get back...

181
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,610
Things will be more normal.

182
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,010
I've said no to things.

183
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,790
But I've also said yes to things.

184
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,910
Congratulations on your honeymoon in Japan.

185
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,990
With who?

186
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,150
Ayami.

187
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,110
Ayami?

188
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,150
Ayami?

189
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,510
Ayami?

190
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,370
Ayami?

191
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:03,390
Ayami?

192
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,530
It's great to meet you yesterday.

193
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,230
I hope my sister's keychain plush made it to you without it.

194
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,590
Thank you!

195
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,030
I can't wait to get it.

196
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,130
They said they were gonna send it to me.

197
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,670
So...

198
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,130
Yeah!

199
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,050
I will get it!

200
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:13,550
I will get it!

201
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,130
I will get it!

202
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,690
I will get it!

203
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,290
I will get it!

204
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,570
I will get it!

205
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,410
I hope someday travels to Japan for the 50th time this year.

206
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,370
IT'S NOT MY FAULT!

207
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,490
It's not my fault.

208
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,090
Because, uh...

209
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,370
Because, uh...

210
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:37,810
Um...

211
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,110
It's really just like...

212
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,390
Like I said, the one thing...

213
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,290
That I got asked to do...

214
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,450
And then...

215
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,410
Matara and I weren't even gonna...

216
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,290
I wasn't even gonna do the second trip to Japan.

217
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,630
It's because Matara gave me COVID!

218
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,130
And so we couldn't do anything...

219
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,410
That we wanted to!

220
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,430
BEFORE!

221
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,810
Stop beating yourself up.

222
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,470
It's still fun to bully someone who bullies himself.

223
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,530
You still bully me!

224
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:06,870
P.S.

225
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,650
Short and stanky.

226
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,450
You still bully me!

227
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,210
I'm from Texas but I'm sorry I couldn't go to work, boss.

228
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:12,810
What?

229
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,430
That's totally fine!

230
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:14,990
Fixie!

231
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,030
Oh my gosh.

232
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,960
But um...

233
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,020
So...

234
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,660
It's gonna be a busy month for me.

235
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,200
It already was.

236
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,220
This month.

237
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,300
But I'm having fun!

238
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,020
Let's see what the newest maps are.

239
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,160
Sometimes you get some really funny maps in here.

240
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,980
Sometimes you get some really cra- Oh!

241
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,480
Wait, I can show you my favorites!

242
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,560
Here's my favorite maps.

243
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,260
We have the monkey ice god.

244
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,440
We have the Edelwood ticket.

245
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,520
Isn't that Edelwood?

246
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,380
Isn't that from...

247
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,060
Over the Garden Wall?

248
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,780
We have Five Nights at Freddy's.

249
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,040
We have...

250
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,100
Why are you in my swamp?

251
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,280
We have Maxwell the cat.

252
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,660
We have this really awesome Interstellar one.

253
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,500
My head's kinda big.

254
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,280
Interstellar.

255
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,940
And then Aqua.

256
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,220
Aqua.

257
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,900
Aqua from Konosuba.

258
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,160
Yeah.

259
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,720
COVID?

260
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,660
Nah, you got cute vids.

261
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,960
Maxwell or Riot?

262
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,000
It's so awesome, right?

263
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,120
Just make sure you get your rest.

264
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,000
Brain frog is real.

265
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,960
I know.

266
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,860
I am worried about the brain frog.

267
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,040
But I've also been planning some stuff as well.

268
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,240
I've been trying to be like...

269
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,380
Okay.

270
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,620
If I have free day, I do this.

271
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,880
So, yeah.

272
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,280
Gonna leave her behind in economy class again.

273
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,180
She wasn't even in economy class.

274
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,540
But also, we're not flying together this time.

275
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,660
I wonder if there's any mint ones.

276
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,680
Mint.

277
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,680
Aww.

278
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,100
Mint monkey.

279
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,220
Mint monkey.

280
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,540
What about Minto?

281
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,230
I have a question as a new Wisp.

282
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,150
I have a question as a new Wisp.

283
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,970
I've been trying to figure out...

284
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,570
Figure this out for a good while.

285
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,710
What is that big ol' spike on the top of your head?

286
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,150
What is that big ol' spike on the top of your head?

287
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,990
Is it part of the maid outfit?

288
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,690
Or is it a hat?

289
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,570
What is it?

290
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,130
Let me see if I can pull up a picture.

291
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,330
It's actually...

292
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,250
It's actually a ghost thing.

293
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,630
Hitaikakushi.

294
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,410
Hitaikakushi.

295
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,970
It's called a Hitaikakushi.

296
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,930
And it's something you'll often see ghosts wearing.

297
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:02,830
Here, here.

298
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:03,930
Here, here, here.

299
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,370
Like this.

300
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,390
Here, here.

301
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,930
That's such a great question.

302
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,670
Also, thanks for being here.

303
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,630
New Wisp.

304
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,630
Everybody be nice to the new Wisp.

305
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,690
See, see?

306
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,450
But mine is just kind of off-centered a little bit.

307
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,370
It's her horn because she's horny.

308
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,530
That's not wrong.

309
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,130
But it's also not the case here.

310
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,430
I thought it was a dunce cap.

311
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,070
A...

312
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,350
A dunce cap?

313
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,370
I'll tell you.

314
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,450
I have an IQ of 181.

315
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,630
I have an IQ...

316
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,050
of 187.

317
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,490
I just gained 5...

318
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,690
6 IQ points just now.

319
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,310
I...

320
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,330
I... My IQ...

321
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,370
My IQ is older than your dog.

322
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,470
My IQ is older than your dog.

323
00:15:59,470 --> 00:15:59,950
Your grandma.

324
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,250
And their ages combined.

325
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,890
My IQ is higher than your family bloodline.

326
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:07,290
My IQ is higher than your family bloodline.

327
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,700
Dunce cap.

328
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,100
Dunce cap.

329
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,000
But yeah, it's called a Hitaikakushi.

330
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:20,720
But yeah, it's called a Hitaikakushi.

331
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,160
Or a ghost triangle.

332
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:25,960
I don't know.

333
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,280
Oh my gosh though!

334
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,160
These look so good!

335
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,780
I do remember seeing them on Twitter.

336
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,220
But thank you for uploading them.

337
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,220
Ghost triangle.

338
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,080
Ghost horn.

339
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,280
Gold.

340
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,640
You know what?

341
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,320
Let's do the Minto maps.

342
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,420
I have another meet and greet later on.

343
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,360
So uh...

344
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,380
What time is that?

345
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,860
Let me confirm.

346
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,760
Uh...

347
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,300
Um...

348
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,880
Let me see.

349
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,860
Where's the... Where's my schedule?

350
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,240
Wait.

351
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,060
There's my schedule.

352
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,380
I have another one and...

353
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,140
I have a lot of hours.

354
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,580
8.30 CST.

355
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,180
Am I gonna see you there again, rice nut?

356
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,240
No!

357
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:26,560
Hahaha!

358
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,340
I was so shocked.

359
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,360
The meet and greets were like in front of everybody.

360
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,400
Let him live?

361
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,320
Hahaha!

362
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:41,980
No!

363
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,560
Difficulty...

364
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,280
What's medium?

365
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,300
Oh yeah, we'll do medium.

366
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,120
We were shocked too!

367
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:51,960
I know!

368
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,300
You didn't know either?

369
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:54,540
No!

370
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,280
I had no idea.

371
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,320
It was my first time that it was like a...

372
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,340
public meet and greet like that.

373
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,200
It was so crazy.

374
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,240
But everyone was so funny.

375
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,500
Even the person that showed me like fetish art of mine.

376
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,340
Hahaha!

377
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,140
That they commissioned.

378
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,060
Hahaha!

379
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,010
They were like, do you wanna see...

380
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,590
some art I commissioned of you?

381
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,170
And I was like, yeah!

382
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,630
And they showed me a picture and I was like...

383
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:25,390
Oh!

384
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,610
So cute!

385
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,930
And I was like, why am I holding a frying pan?

386
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,310
And then he was like...

387
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,770
Do you wanna see another picture that's like...

388
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,470
A little more...

389
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:35,730
Risky?

390
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,370
And I was like...

391
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,190
Yeah!

392
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,730
And then he showed it to me.

393
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,130
I was like...

394
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,270
Why do I have a frying pan now?

395
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,210
It was a chubby Minto!

396
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,570
I was like, huh?

397
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,090
Oh my god.

398
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,590
Was it because you were cooking?

399
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,410
More ways than one.

400
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,050
Probably.

401
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,070
I was like, oh my god, no.

402
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,370
This is...

403
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,020
Sometimes...

404
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,860
I think we're too comfortable...

405
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,580
with each other.

406
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,720
Hahaha!

407
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,740
Hahaha!

408
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,710
Where can I put...

409
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,670
I can't in my hair.

410
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,430
But sometimes in my hair.

411
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,150
Oh wait, this is the pathway, right?

412
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,910
Wow, there's so much space!

413
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,290
Oh, I can't in the flowers.

414
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,250
Or on my...

415
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,830
leaves.

416
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,370
I can put here.

417
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,470
Okay, let's just do...

418
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,490
Here, I'm gonna put...

419
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:49,810
Soda.

420
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,250
Okay, this might be stupid.

421
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,670
I'm gonna put soda at the end.

422
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,970
So we can see what the pathway is.

423
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,750
We can always move her.

424
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,590
Here they go!

425
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,750
Around my face!

426
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,090
They're framing me!

427
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,720
Should this be...

428
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,940
No, I feel like with the ice monkey only challenge...

429
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,220
We could have...

430
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,080
a sword.

431
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,680
We'll do the ice monkey god...

432
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,300
God...

433
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,440
I'm gonna shrink myself a little bit.

434
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,940
We'll do the ice monkey god...

435
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,200
map.

436
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,640
And we'll do only...

437
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,320
ice monkeys.

438
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,900
Wait, what can be my nose?

439
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,880
Why didn't you give me a nose?

440
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,660
It's missing.

441
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,520
Become your own nose.

442
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,140
This...

443
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,200
This can be my nose.

444
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,300
There's a spot...

445
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,360
There's a spot...

446
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,100
for 00 ice monkey in the center of the heart.

447
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,660
Also, all the blue is water.

448
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,800
Also, all the blue is water.

449
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,000
We can put ice monkey in the center of the heart?

450
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,240
We can put ice monkey in the center of the heart?

451
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,700
No way.

452
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,580
What a great map, Ashen!

453
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:13,680
What a great map, Ashen!

454
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,060
Thank you!

455
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,580
Uh-oh.

456
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:17,960
Come on.

457
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,480
Oh my god.

458
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:19,980
Oh my god!

459
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,300
No!

460
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,400
They're getting through!

461
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,920
Handle it!

462
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,400
Miss Mel-chan!

463
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,380
Thanks for the gift!

464
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,560
Thank you!

465
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,700
Thank you!

466
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,860
Be fast.

467
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,900
Be swift.

468
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,160
But yeah, the con has been a lot of fun so far.

469
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,640
I had a first panel.

470
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,840
That one was also streamed with...

471
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,360
with two other...

472
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,220
two other VTubers.

473
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,960
And...

474
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,940
Oh my god.

475
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,260
With Mika and Zane.

476
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,200
And they put together a powerpoint.

477
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,440
Or like a guess the monster thing for me.

478
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,080
Oh wait, so these are water.

479
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,120
Oh nice.

480
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,220
Is this water too?

481
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,520
Oh!

482
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,620
Wow, it's all water!

483
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,560
I wanna make my own map.

484
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,860
But you have to pay for it.

485
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,380
Minto, your Godot senses.

486
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,700
Minto, your Godot senses.

487
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,480
What can I say?

488
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,060
When I say that I love someone or something...

489
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,740
It's true love.

490
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,080
Is this a... Oh, here.

491
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,760
I'm trying to... How can I...

492
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,580
Maybe I should make the plane my...

493
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,600
my nose.

494
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,360
The Hannin sound was crazy.

495
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,660
It was just because it was a shadow person.

496
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,520
But it ended up being even crazier than I expected.

497
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,840
I didn't think I was right.

498
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,660
Like how you love snake.

499
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:05,720
Yeah.

500
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,500
Hehehe.

501
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,820
Sexy soup.

502
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,080
For those...

503
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,440
Oh my gosh.

504
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:13,920
Oh no!

505
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,520
Oh no!

506
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,800
Sana, what are you doing?

507
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,640
We're gonna...

508
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,740
Oh, good, good, good.

509
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,160
Here we go.

510
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,240
My nose.

511
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,620
I look like a piggy.

512
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,920
Come on, thanks!

513
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,680
Come on, thanks!

514
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
I love Chibi Minto so much.

515
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,620
I think it's the Garfield-like, uninterested expression in your eyes.

516
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,320
Thank you, thank you.

517
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,120
I

518
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,250
hate Mondays.

519
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:43,230
I hate Mondays.

520
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:43,290
I hate Mondays.

521
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,730
You should have said your Hitaikakushi was like a...

522
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,470
was a horn.

523
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,950
Like venom snake's horn grows more the... grows the more you make wisps cry.

524
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,090
Oinky doink.

525
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:56,450
Oinky doink.

526
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,750
My brain is so empty today.

527
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,110
I think also...

528
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,510
I had to take some...

529
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,530
like medicine.

530
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,870
And I still am hungover from the...

531
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,890
It's like an allergy medicine.

532
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,710
You know when you take an allergy medicine and it makes your brain fog so much.

533
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,430
The Texan air.

534
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,410
My nose is sideways.

535
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:23,530
Nose!

536
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,190
It's fine this way.

537
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,370
Sticks with me the whole next day.

538
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,170
Yeah, I know!

539
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:31,710
Me too!

540
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,990
It's so like...

541
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,890
The antihistamines.

542
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,530
Ate Mondays.

543
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,210
Love lasagna.

544
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,230
Simple airs.

545
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,790
Welcome to membership.

546
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:45,510
Thank you!

547
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,990
It was prescribed antihistamines for sleeping tablets.

548
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,630
One time...

549
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,730
Yeah, I've been given...

550
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,170
They gave one time...

551
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:56,950
One time they gave me medicine.

552
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,650
That was like a daily medicine.

553
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,270
That was antihistamine.

554
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,170
I was like, I can't take this.

555
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,070
It was... I'll just say it.

556
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,430
It was an anti-anxiety...

557
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,230
It was anti-anxiety meds.

558
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,550
And I was like...

559
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,570
I'm gonna be more anxious cause I'm tired!

560
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,190
Because I can't wake up!

561
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,090
Loki, thanks for the tech gifted!

562
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,050
But yeah, ever since I took the medicine...

563
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,670
The Benadryl, I've been like...

564
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,210
My brain...

565
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,630
I can't wake up.

566
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,690
Take your ghost meds.

567
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,510
Alright, let's see.

568
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,650
Let's do...

569
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,230
Which ones?

570
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,270
Flying fortress.

571
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,170
I love never miss targeting!

572
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,470
Never miss!

573
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,030
Never miss!

574
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,530
Never miss!

575
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,090
Oh...

576
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,110
Whoa!

577
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:48,610
Whoa!

578
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:48,830
Whoa!

579
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,870
Guys, I think we're in trouble.

580
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,450
Come on!

581
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,690
Keep popping!

582
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,870
Guys, we're already...

583
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,870
We've lost so many lives.

584
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,850
I have to take my anxiety meds before bed.

585
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:04,570
You're smart.

586
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,010
But even still, like...

587
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,570
The next day just makes me be like...

588
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,610
That's why I'm monkey brain right now.

589
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,570
That's why I'm monkey brain right now.

590
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,330
Bust those balloons!

591
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,850
Come on!

592
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,400
Monkey brain!

593
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,140
Minto map doesn't play around.

594
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,700
Minto map doesn't play around.

595
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,020
You know what, let's...

596
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,560
Wait, where does it start?

597
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,580
Shoot.

598
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,860
Oh my gosh!

599
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,300
Oh my gosh!

600
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,740
Oh my gosh!

601
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,580
Okay, we're good.

602
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,720
Yeah, start squishing.

603
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,720
Start squishing those...

604
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,840
Bigger globs.

605
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,350
New generation Anihistamines are safer.

606
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,810
Benadryl hits really hard and ain't supposed to be great on the daily.

607
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:00,930
Oh, I don't take it daily.

608
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,230
I took it...

609
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,410
I took it two days ago.

610
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,510
And I'm still feeling it.

611
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,270
I'm like, whoa.

612
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,470
Uh oh.

613
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,850
We're losing more stuff, you guys.

614
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:12,870
I think we're in trouble.

615
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,810
I think we might be in trouble.

616
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,680
This map is pretty hard with its short path.

617
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,020
Why'd you gotta make it so difficult?

618
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,280
How'd you draw everything?

619
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,120
It's literally...

620
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,680
It's literally me.

621
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,220
It's me if I had a tan.

622
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,120
Minto goes to the beach.

623
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,280
Fake.

624
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,020
Oh my god.

625
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,600
Go Sara!

626
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:58,840
Go!

627
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,380
Go Sara!

628
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,440
Oh, she's faster now!

629
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,040
She's faster now.

630
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,720
She's leveled up.

631
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,500
Yes!

632
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,360
So is Ice Monkey.

633
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,280
He's faster now.

634
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,600
Come on.

635
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:13,860
Nice.

636
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,980
Tan lines on Mint Artist, please.

637
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,210
Summer's got you thinking summer-brained.

638
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,000
Is that Mumei?

639
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,100
Thank you for the tan gifted!

640
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:35,820
Thank you!

641
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,090
Thank you so much!

642
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,600
I don't ever...

643
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,860
I, you know... Oh, shoot.

644
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,380
Uh oh.

645
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:45,780
Oh, wait.

646
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,060
We have Sawada.

647
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,580
She's great.

648
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,760
Um...

649
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,240
I...

650
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,640
Even when I would go out a lot...

651
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,960
and outside...

652
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,780
I never got tan lines or anything.

653
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,480
I'm a...

654
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,140
I'm a ghost that burns.

655
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,340
My ectoplasm burns.

656
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,100
I do not tan.

657
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,880
So it's...

658
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,620
So it's hard for me to...

659
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,600
Because you're a ghost.

660
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,200
Yeah.

661
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,760
I don't tan though.

662
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,200
But it's kind of sad, right?

663
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,800
Like...

664
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,620
Okay.

665
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,220
Okay, we're so close.

666
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:22,760
Come on.

667
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,320
Come on, Sawada.

668
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,360
Don't let him pass.

669
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:25,940
Handle it.

670
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,660
She reflects all the beams.

671
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,100
Come on!

672
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,940
Once we have the never-miss, we'll be so good.

673
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,060
Yeah!

674
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,100
Yeah!

675
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,360
Not even a farmer's tan?

676
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,020
You know how like some people, if they drive, they get like a driver's tan?

677
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,440
Like just the...

678
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,220
Just the left side of their...

679
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,280
Or I guess depends on where you drive.

680
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,220
If you drive on the left side or the right side.

681
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,360
My favorite game.

682
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,980
Balloon...Balloon Teddy 6.

683
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,200
Is that related to Ben 10?

684
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,080
Uh oh.

685
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,020
Uh oh.

686
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:09,980
Wait.

687
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,400
Uh oh.

688
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,960
I need something!

689
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,320
I need Scissor 61!

690
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:16,980
Uh oh.

691
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,480
Wait.

692
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,840
Oh, shoot.

693
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,340
You!

694
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,740
No!

695
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,920
I can't be...

696
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,460
Oh,

697
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,210
you sawed his ability!

698
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,730
What does this do?

699
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,670
Oh, neat!

700
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,550
I have to pay for them.

701
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,110
Which one would you want, Ashen?

702
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,610
You want right...

703
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,250
Can I give...

704
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:58,370
35% of any accolade purchase goes directly to the registered player.

705
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,130
You can make money off of this?

706
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,170
You can make money off of this?

707
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,610
Time to quit my job.

708
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,620
Why?

709
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,820
Okay.

710
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,200
Ashen Offstream, I'm gonna give you...

711
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,260
I'm gonna give you...

712
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,860
Dancing Monkey.

713
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,620
I'm gonna give you RGB Monkey.

714
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,960
I'm gonna give it to you.

715
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,900
Rip Bozo.

716
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,660
Shut up!

717
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,220
Shut up to you!

718
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,060
I can't believe I lost.

719
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,260
I can't believe I lost.

720
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:44,640
I mean, I can.

721
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,560
I wasn't playing very well.

722
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,400
Let's try the next one.

723
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,880
Let's try the next one.

724
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,420
This one.

725
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,720
It looks like I'm eating leaves.

726
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,520
It looks like I'm eating leaves.

727
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,660
Is this all water?

728
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,600
Let's see.

729
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,560
Oh, it is!

730
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,760
There's plenty of water on this map.

731
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,480
Not this one.

732
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,400
I like the music in this one.

733
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,000
I like the music in this one.

734
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,540
Speaking of Tam Minto art, don't forget to use boomer for 10% off your gamersubs order.

735
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,620
Let's give Minto her own wife a cup.

736
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,520
Thank you!

737
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,720
So we have bloons, vtubers, super chats.

738
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,560
Speaking of the gamersubs, I do have to still...

739
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,720
I was thinking maybe instead of using a Google form...

740
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,540
My friend actually linked me to a website.

741
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,500
That might be better because I feel like a Google form...

742
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,280
I was thinking...

743
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,920
If some people retweet the form, you know?

744
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:04,340
And then it goes outside of my sphere and then people are just like, Free $100 coupon!

745
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,340
I'll take it!

746
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,180
Yeah, for the giveaway.

747
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

748
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,560
So I was just like, I want to give it to one of you guys.

749
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,800
I don't want to give it to some rando.

750
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,480
So...

751
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,840
I'm going to try the website.

752
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:26,160
It's one of those things where it's just like, Follow Femint Phantom on Twitter and subscribe to her channel.

753
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,760
One of those.

754
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,280
But I'm not going to make it so egregious where it's like, Tell your grandma!

755
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,740
Share on Facebook!

756
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:34,480
You know?

757
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,320
Gleam?

758
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,520
What's gleam?

759
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,240
No...

760
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,520
The one my friend sent me was...

761
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,540
Something else...

762
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,980
Tell grandma.

763
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,320
Retweet all of Minto's tweets for one entry.

764
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,900
Yeah, send to five friends.

765
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,720
Yeah, yeah.

766
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,260
I don't want to do all of that.

767
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,760
I told my rabbit about you.

768
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
Thank you!

769
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,420
Alright.

770
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,500
We're going to put sawdust.

771
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,380
Do you think I can put sawdust?

772
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,200
Where do I go?

773
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,960
Where do the balloons go?

774
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,560
I guess we'll find out.

775
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,660
The music in this one is so fun!

776
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,910
The music in this one is so fun!

777
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,930
Rabbits know a lot of critters too.

778
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,590
I showed my dog your snake eater short.

779
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,450
He loved it.

780
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,490
I'm honored!

781
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,610
Let's see.

782
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,870
Let's also do...

783
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,590
Let's put him here.

784
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,950
He's our backup defense.

785
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,250
How did your panel go, Mint?

786
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:01,930
That was fun!

787
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,970
It was so much fun!

788
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,690
It goes from the dotted lines and down your shoulder.

789
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:09,790
Wait.

790
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,790
So like...

791
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,750
Well, we'll see.

792
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,570
Here we go.

793
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,170
Wow!

794
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,510
I should have put that boat there.

795
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,650
What's wrong with me?

796
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,290
Let's put him here.

797
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,630
Long range!

798
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,850
Around my huge head?

799
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,860
It's for holding all my secrets!

800
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,840
It's for holding all my secrets!

801
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,880
Oh yeah!

802
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,580
Mermonkey!

803
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,600
I have seen Mermonkey.

804
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,440
I'm excited because Mermonkey looks like...

805
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,960
It looks like Mermonkey can go on land and on sea!

806
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,740
That's huge!

807
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,000
That's huge!

808
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,180
That's...

809
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,600
That's big news!

810
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,460
Alright then.

811
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,540
Keep your secrets.

812
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,340
Okay.

813
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,280
We're gonna...

814
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:17,920
Oops.

815
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,160
My bad.

816
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,260
I don't know why I pressed that on accident.

817
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,900
We're gonna work with these guys.

818
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,280
I wanna go with the middle, the middle, the middle.

819
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,760
Barb darts!

820
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,880
Once we get this, we can pierce the...

821
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,940
I think the next one can pierce the lead.

822
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,060
Yeah, yeah.

823
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,980
The lead and the steely ones.

824
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,320
Right?

825
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,200
I can really put Ice Monkey in your heart.

826
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,700
I wish there was a good place for Ice Monkey on this map.

827
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:47,820
Maybe...

828
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,960
Maybe my eyes...

829
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,300
Oh, that's not Ice Monkey.

830
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,560
Oh, I can't afford Ice Monkey.

831
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,820
There we go.

832
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,220
You could be kissing him.

833
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,300
The eyes are water.

834
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,230
Brick, you made this one, didn't you?

835
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,500
Kissing Ice Monkey.

836
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,840
Thank you for being so easy to show how awesome VTubers are.

837
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,320
I just showed my normie friends your rendition of Break Stuff and they...

838
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,280
They love it.

839
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,480
Really?

840
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,640
Oh my god!

841
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,260
What just happened?

842
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,340
Oh, I didn't mean to click that!

843
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:40,980
I meant to...

844
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,620
Oh my gosh, I meant to click this guy.

845
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,740
People love your Break Stuff.

846
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,280
I get so embarrassed.

847
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,400
I seriously...

848
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,280
I can't even, like, watch...

849
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,360
I can't listen to myself back about it.

850
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,700
Before watching Mint, I was a believer in laws like Murphy's Law where anything that can go wrong will go wrong.

851
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,240
Since I discovered Mint, my life has changed for the better.

852
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,460
Now I only believe in Cole's Law, which is shredded cabbage and creepy chips.

853
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,220
That

854
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,750
was actually so good!

855
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,590
It caught me...

856
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,390
It caught me so off-guard!

857
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,150
Oh my...

858
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,900
That one was so funny!

859
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,740
That one was so good, Kinky!

860
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,480
Cole's Law!

861
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,700
Oh wow!

862
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,540
I really like that one.

863
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,960
Let's do ballistic missiles.

864
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,240
Nice!

865
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,260
Now I get...

866
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,160
Yeah, Cole's Law!

867
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,940
It's cre...

868
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,160
It's shredded cabbage and creamy dressing!

869
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,320
But it's Cole's...

870
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:26,880
Law!

871
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,490
Damn it, I just got it.

872
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:34,650
Oh!

873
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,950
Glitch Face, your friend told me that you wanted to be at the con.

874
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,310
But you couldn't make it.

875
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,080
Thanks for explaining.

876
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:49,960
You're welcome!

877
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,780
You know what?

878
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,760
I also don't really like Cole's Law that much.

879
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,360
I'll be honest.

880
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,360
I'm not a hater.

881
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,980
But I don't like Cole's Law that much.

882
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,480
It's okay, you know?

883
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,140
Where do you think I can put...

884
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:05,840
Hmm...

885
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,600
Let's put Druid Monkey...

886
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,840
Let's put him over here.

887
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,740
So, wait...

888
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,320
Where do they go again?

889
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,800
Oh shoot, I think I'm too good at the game.

890
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,900
I can't tell what the path is.

891
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,660
It's this way, right?

892
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,960
It goes up and around down my shoulder.

893
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,120
I think.

894
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,180
Some recipes are better than others.

895
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,700
I was introduced to using Greek Yogurt for making Cole's Law.

896
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,260
Well, I think it's also...

897
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,280
I don't like raw cabbage at all.

898
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,540
I hate raw cabbage.

899
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,680
I love...

900
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,480
I will eat cooked cabbage for days.

901
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,860
But raw cabbage...

902
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,380
I really dislike.

903
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,780
I've eaten Cole's Law.

904
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,560
It's had 5 pounds of sugar and it's gross.

905
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,620
Ewww.

906
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,260
Sauerkraut?

907
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,300
I don't think I've ever had it.

908
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,160
She hates raw cabbage.

909
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:04,520
I do!

910
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,340
Just don't use raw cabbage then.

911
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,060
But isn't that like the point of Cole's Law?

912
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:30,610
Mint's Law.

913
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,630
She hates all her cabbage viewers.

914
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,770
Raise your hand if you're a cabbage viewer.

915
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,610
Raise your hand if you're a cabbage viewer.

916
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,890
I'll personally apologize.

917
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,610
Maybe I can put him here.

918
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,390
Maybe I can put him here.

919
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,830
Put him here, pal.

920
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,310
Oh, here maybe.

921
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,910
And then...

922
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,870
Put him here.

923
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,870
And then...

924
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,270
I can have...

925
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,910
Will the farms fit?

926
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,310
Oh, I don't think so.

927
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,510
Hold on, let's see how it works.

928
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,090
If I can fit...

929
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:16,490
Like...

930
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,010
Guys?

931
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:21,550
I thought I broke the game.

932
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:22,670
Good morning, Minto.

933
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,170
Doing great today?

934
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,350
You too, Magister!

935
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,690
The cabbage warriors.

936
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,890
I saw not a single hand.

937
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:30,930
I think you guys are lying.

938
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:31,730
I'm just kidding.

939
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,930
What is this part that makes it so I can't build on it?

940
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,390
I wonder.

941
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,510
Do I want to keep him here or not?

942
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:46,790
Oh!

943
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,890
We also need a plain monkey.

944
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,610
A plain...

945
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,350
monkey.

946
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,590
I'm gonna put plain monkey...

947
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:55,970
here.

948
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,590
Rapid fire.

949
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:03,330
Okay, here we go.

950
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,480
Well, we got plain monkey.

951
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,360
But when are we getting plantain monkey?

952
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,350
We're all cabbages.

953
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,890
You're the cabbage man from Avatar The Last Airbender.

954
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:29,070
My cabbages!

955
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,580
I'm gonna sell him.

956
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:35,840
Bye!

957
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,080
This map looks like the Vtuber Minto Minto.

958
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:41,580
This map looks like the Vtuber Minto Minto.

959
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,580
I don't see the resemblance.

960
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,580
I don't see the resemblance.

961
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,920
Whatever happened to the cabbage guy?

962
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,200
Was he okay?

963
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:57,820
Who?

964
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,800
Don't who me!

965
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,980
Don't who me!

966
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:09,860
Don't who me!

967
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,560
Nice!

968
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,580
Oh yeah!

969
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,440
Here we go, baby!

970
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:20,770
Oh yeah!

971
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,020
I think we're good for a minute.

972
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,000
Actually...

973
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,500
Hold on.

974
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,340
I wanna do this.

975
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,940
Do you think it'll reach?

976
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,240
Okay, you know what?

977
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:35,600
Hmm...

978
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,700
I don't think it'll reach...

979
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,240
Oh no!

980
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,180
I wanted to get...

981
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,400
both of them, but I don't think it'll reach.

982
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,040
Bigger.

983
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,500
Nooooo!

984
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,540
Nooooo!

985
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:57,860
Hmm...

986
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,320
Hmm...

987
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:03,900
Hmm...

988
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,820
He made a company called Cabbage Corp.

989
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,040
He made a company called Cabbage Corp.

990
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,920
They build automobiles.

991
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:10,300
They build automobiles.

992
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,760
We have enough for an ice monkey.

993
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,580
Yeah, we do.

994
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,340
I'll decide what I want.

995
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,240
I'll decide what I want to do after a few more.

996
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,280
I love never miss planes.

997
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,480
I love never miss planes.

998
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:37,800
Look at that.

999
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,620
So awesome.

1000
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,380
Ghost monkey win.

1001
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:43,960
Yeah!

1002
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,500
Ghost monkey win.

1003
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,520
I mean we have necromancer monkey, but it's not the same.

1004
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,240
Second village to make the first village longer.

1005
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:53,380
Second village to make the first village longer.

1006
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,200
Wait, can I do that?

1007
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,300
How do you do that?

1008
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,720
How would it...

1009
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,900
This one?

1010
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,640
Bunky city?

1011
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,640
Increases influence...

1012
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,840
This one, right?

1013
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,380
Just overlap the zones.

1014
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,080
Okay.

1015
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,680
We'll do...

1016
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,160
We'll do here.

1017
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,100
What?

1018
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,740
I keep accidentally pressing and I'm breaking the game.

1019
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,140
I keep accidentally pressing and I'm breaking the game.

1020
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:26,280
Um...

1021
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,600
Guys?

1022
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,220
Oh!

1023
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:31,320
Oh!

1024
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,720
Yippee!

1025
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,200
It worked!

1026
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,680
I didn't know that.

1027
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,150
Oh my god.

1028
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:50,170
Uh oh.

1029
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:51,610
Uh oh.

1030
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:53,650
Okay.

1031
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,270
We're not quite moab ready.

1032
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:00,010
Good to know.

1033
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:03,230
Secret monkey tech.

1034
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:09,950
We'll make everybody faster at least.

1035
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,230
Yeah, that was pretty bad.

1036
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,030
That wasn't great.

1037
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,160
Hmm...

1038
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:28,900
Monkey farm.

1039
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,440
I do need a monkey farm.

1040
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:31,800
I need monkey everything.

1041
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,500
Trying to save up money.

1042
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,580
Monkey money.

1043
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,600
Corvus is kind of a ghost monkey, but the cool part is that he commands a wisp.

1044
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,580
Who's Corvus?

1045
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,020
Who's Corvus?

1046
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,340
You're just making people up.

1047
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,280
Micromanagement heavy though.

1048
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,020
Micromanagement heavy though.

1049
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,600
Oh, I forgot I also have this.

1050
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,100
Use it for the next...

1051
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:02,780
Let's see.

1052
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,960
Let's do the moab glue.

1053
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,140
So if we get another moab.

1054
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,840
It should be real slow.

1055
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:09,680
It should be real slow.

1056
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,680
4-4-4-4!

1057
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,940
We were at 4-4-4-4 money!

1058
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,380
We were at 4-4-4-4 money!

1059
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,460
Spooky!

1060
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,920
Where's ice monkey?

1061
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,680
He's on vacation.

1062
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,520
Glue gunner?

1063
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,480
Glue gunner's pretty good.

1064
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,580
I think glue gunner's a little underrated.

1065
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,640
As you can see, it makes it really...

1066
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,620
They really slow down a lot.

1067
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,760
Where should I put him?

1068
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,600
Where should I put him?

1069
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,480
I could put him like...

1070
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,060
See, I'm just like...

1071
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,700
I want him close to some...

1072
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,160
To some monkey...

1073
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,880
Wait, it goes along the dotted line, right?

1074
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,780
If I put him here...

1075
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,060
He should still reach some...

1076
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,320
Some farms then.

1077
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,360
I think.

1078
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:10,740
Hmm...

1079
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,040
Also very good with sawdust.

1080
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:13,300
Yeah!

1081
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,720
Just above sawdust.

1082
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,280
But it won't reach up here, right?

1083
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,420
It goes through my hair.

1084
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,700
This hair.

1085
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,500
Not this hair.

1086
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,760
If there's here...

1087
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,560
This should be good.

1088
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,620
Oh my god.

1089
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,100
That was close.

1090
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,380
Hmm...

1091
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,040
Good job, everybody.

1092
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,820
I wanna make money!

1093
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,360
I actually use ice monkey more than glue gunner.

1094
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,660
Ice monkey...

1095
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,960
Will never work a day in his life.

1096
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,380
Except he has all this experience.

1097
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,420
And has popped like five balloons.

1098
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,180
Works suck but coming home to Minto stream good.

1099
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:00,960
Yay!

1100
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,120
Otsu!

1101
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,280
Otsu, Otsu, Otsu.

1102
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,660
Otsu, Otsu, Otsu.

1103
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,560
Freeloader.

1104
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,060
Kinda.

1105
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,060
I didn't say it though.

1106
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:15,440
You did.

1107
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,940
Oh shoot.

1108
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,400
Oh my god.

1109
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,480
Nice.

1110
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,780
Come on, Saura.

1111
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,160
Handle it.

1112
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,760
Nice, everybody.

1113
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,320
Nice.

1114
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:32,700
Do I wanna up...

1115
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,060
You know what?

1116
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:33,980
I will upgrade this one.

1117
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,220
Upgrade that one and then we make more money.

1118
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,680
Don't let ice monkey's hands get dirty.

1119
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,300
Everybody hates dirty ice.

1120
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,000
That's the worst.

1121
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,520
It gets so disgusting.

1122
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,600
I was about to...

1123
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,420
I was about to...

1124
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:01,620
Unironically, I was about to start speaking like that one guy in Star Wars.

1125
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,820
That's just like, I hate sand.

1126
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:03,780
It's coarse.

1127
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,700
I was gonna be like, I hate dirty ice.

1128
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:06,760
It's gross.

1129
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,740
It's dirty.

1130
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,000
It's coarse.

1131
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,780
I was about to unironically sound like that guy.

1132
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:16,940
Anakin, yeah.

1133
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,200
Nice.

1134
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,980
Alright, let's get... You know what?

1135
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,960
You go here.

1136
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,100
Actually...

1137
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,050
Here.

1138
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,630
Then we can start...

1139
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:48,990
I wonder if it'll reach.

1140
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,150
I think so.

1141
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,830
If I put one here...

1142
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:56,650
No!

1143
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:58,070
No!

1144
00:51:58,930 --> 00:51:59,770
No!

1145
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,060
Doesn't fit.

1146
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:12,740
Turn boiled pasta water into ice cubes to serve to guests that you don't like.

1147
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:13,940
Ew.

1148
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:16,720
Ew.

1149
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,470
Money, money, money.

1150
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:34,610
Wait, I think it's...

1151
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:39,590
It generates...

1152
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:40,410
Oh...

1153
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:44,410
I thought his range increased.

1154
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,110
I do that with rubbing alcohol.

1155
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,130
That doesn't sound legal.

1156
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:49,930
I'll be honest.

1157
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:50,950
Why did I do that?

1158
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:51,830
I did not mean to do that.

1159
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,930
That doesn't sound like...

1160
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:54,470
Hahaha.

1161
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:57,710
Hahaha.

1162
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:00,150
Doesn't sound very good.

1163
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:02,230
Doesn't sound very legal.

1164
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:03,210
I'll be honest.

1165
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,230
But I've always...

1166
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:09,150
I know...

1167
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:11,530
I've always wanted to try like doing the ice...

1168
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:14,210
The chocolate milk ice cubes and stuff like that.

1169
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:15,830
That sounds good.

1170
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:23,090
I do it with cyanide.

1171
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:25,810
I also think that's not legal.

1172
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:26,810
Hahaha.

1173
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:28,850
Hahaha.

1174
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,920
Oh my gosh, we're almost there.

1175
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:36,420
Oh, a coffee!

1176
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,960
Coffee ice cubes!

1177
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:38,440
Yes!

1178
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:46,270
Oh my god, in just one shot.

1179
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:50,230
I'll also give you a dancing monkey.

1180
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,400
Don't worry, Brick, I'll give you a dancing monkey too.

1181
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,580
Cold brew ice cubes would totally work.

1182
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:04,880
Yeah!

1183
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,860
Why use frozen coffee or chocolate milk when you could use ice cream?

1184
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,220
Just ice...

1185
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,100
But...

1186
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,500
Ice cream, it doesn't...

1187
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,700
The ice cream doesn't become like a...

1188
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:22,740
It

1189
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,750
doesn't become like a Q-Lube.

1190
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:30,490
It's a different drink.

1191
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,690
Oh no, the reinforced ones.

1192
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,050
Wait, what did I... It's this guy, right?

1193
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:37,870
He's our reinforcement.

1194
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,270
Yeah, yeah, he shatters them shells.

1195
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:42,290
We're gonna put you...

1196
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,270
We're gonna put you right...

1197
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,870
We're gonna stick you right...

1198
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:48,290
You're gonna go right in...

1199
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,950
We're gonna have you right...

1200
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,290
We're gonna stick you right...

1201
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:52,610
We're gonna...

1202
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,450
You're gonna go right...

1203
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,310
You're gonna stick her right in there.

1204
00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:58,590
Right there.

1205
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:00,710
Hahaha.

1206
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:16,970
There we go.

1207
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:17,970
Oh my god!

1208
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:18,150
Hi!

1209
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,610
I was scared for a second.

1210
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,560
Are you sure you didn't take that pill?

1211
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,980
With the Benadryl?

1212
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:39,780
No, I'm okay.

1213
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,160
I'm okay!

1214
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,400
Yeah.

1215
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,120
Yeah.

1216
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:56,960
Yeah!

1217
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:00,340
I feel like I should have gotten more money from that.

1218
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:11,760
Nice.

1219
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:13,680
I'm just gonna keep going.

1220
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,780
I'm just gonna keep on going.

1221
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,080
Wait, how much...

1222
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,180
How much do you have?

1223
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:20,760
22!

1224
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,320
Oh, we're not gonna get into the blue incineration.

1225
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,860
That's kinda sad.

1226
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,500
The big one.

1227
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,120
Increases Bernie stuff damage.

1228
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:31,620
Whoa!

1229
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,320
Seems like a good couple.

1230
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,660
Power couple.

1231
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:35,880
Power couple.

1232
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:51,570
No farms?

1233
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:52,590
No farms?

1234
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:53,410
Nah, this is...

1235
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:54,410
I'm...

1236
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,330
I don't wanna be in...

1237
00:56:56,330 --> 00:57:00,230
This is the run where I...

1238
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:02,770
I don't sell myself.

1239
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:03,030
I don't sell myself.

1240
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,410
You know?

1241
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:08,010
We're just doing it au naturel.

1242
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:08,550
We're just doing it au naturel.

1243
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,480
It's a big farm.

1244
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,240
Poor mode.

1245
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,320
Yeah.

1246
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,140
Get it?

1247
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,280
I'm trying to save up so we can get...

1248
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,420
Maybe Spectre.

1249
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:47,480
We're almost there.

1250
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,520
We'll get there.

1251
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,920
Oh, but maybe I want Spirit of the Forest.

1252
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,200
Oh, but maybe I want Spirit of the Forest.

1253
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,360
I'll decide.

1254
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,320
But Spectre is sooner than this one.

1255
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,980
Monkey Paragon's win.

1256
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,060
That's the...

1257
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,220
That's like the triple...

1258
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,060
The triplets, right?

1259
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,040
I think we'll do Spectre.

1260
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:29,980
Monkey Paragon.

1261
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,060
Yeah, I gotta...

1262
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,460
Oh my gosh.

1263
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,600
Wait, I think I need to finish...

1264
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,540
Metal Gear Solid 2.

1265
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,920
And Eternal Darkness.

1266
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:40,500
Oh my gosh.

1267
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,700
Before I leave for Japan!

1268
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,540
Oh no!

1269
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,740
Oh no!

1270
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,800
And then I'll play 3 once I get home.

1271
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,480
Is this a Monkey XP grinding stream?

1272
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,720
It's a Monkey stream!

1273
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,980
That was so fast.

1274
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,200
Next we'll go for this guy.

1275
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,580
Metal Gear Endurance stream, let's go!

1276
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,920
Metal Gear Endurance stream, let's go!

1277
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,660
Hell yeah.

1278
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,760
I wouldn't say we're close to the end of MGS2.

1279
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:24,920
I think we're like...

1280
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,780
Halfway there.

1281
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,660
But if I'm like strong next time...

1282
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,480
I might be able to get it through it.

1283
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,460
One or two more.

1284
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,460
For sure.

1285
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:38,780
Righty!

1286
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,940
Thanks for three mobs.

1287
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,790
The end does have a lot of cutting, you're right.

1288
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,030
But...

1289
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:52,950
Nice.

1290
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:57,610
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

1291
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:58,830
Look at him go!

1292
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,030
What's the other plane?

1293
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:02,890
The other one that's pretty good.

1294
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,290
Oh, Skyshredder.

1295
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:05,990
Oh wait, I have all of them unlocked.

1296
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:08,270
See, I need more.

1297
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:09,270
I need more XP.

1298
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:13,730
I need a million XP and I only have 14,000.

1299
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,810
I need a million XP and I only have 14,000.

1300
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:19,750
Skip the cutscenes!

1301
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:20,610
Never!

1302
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:24,470
It's a lot grinding for paragons.

1303
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:27,170
Yeah...

1304
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,970
And I don't use anything like the...

1305
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:33,190
Like the special stuff that they...

1306
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,630
The monkey knowledges...

1307
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:35,470
And things like that.

1308
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:38,590
I'm unknowledged.

1309
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,690
We're close to...

1310
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:47,450
You were at 22?

1311
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:48,330
You're still at 22.

1312
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:49,230
Okay, that's fine.

1313
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:52,470
Let's get to the 35,000.

1314
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,570
Or 29,000.

1315
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:55,050
I don't know.

1316
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,370
Whichever you get.

1317
01:00:59,030 --> 01:00:59,550
Nice.

1318
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:03,270
Even though your IQ is so high...

1319
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:05,210
That's why it's so high.

1320
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:07,510
I don't need to rely on cheats.

1321
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:12,450
I don't need to rely on...

1322
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:13,570
You know...

1323
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:14,930
These simple...

1324
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:17,530
These simple methods.

1325
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,330
Mint is the one who finally got me into...

1326
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:23,970
BTD 6.

1327
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:26,830
What do you mean, finally?

1328
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,350
How long have you been...

1329
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:30,370
Waiting to play this game?

1330
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:34,930
This one will also generate...

1331
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:36,730
More money and more lives.

1332
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,410
I love Spirit of the Forest.

1333
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:42,310
Might be my favorite...

1334
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:43,490
My favorite thing.

1335
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:58,300
Nice!

1336
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:58,400
Nice!

1337
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,100
Now we can see the pathway!

1338
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,020
That's the real reason I got it.

1339
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:12,740
A little more.

1340
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:19,820
Nice.

1341
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:20,480
Yep.

1342
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,000
Yep.

1343
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:21,600
Yep.

1344
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,160
Yep.

1345
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,260
Nice.

1346
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,420
Now we know the real...

1347
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:27,880
Pathway.

1348
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:33,330
Basically wanted to wait for a sale.

1349
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:34,810
I think it was on sale during the steam...

1350
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:35,850
The steam sale, wasn't it?

1351
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:52,470
Maybe I should do...

1352
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:53,690
The banana farms over here.

1353
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,110
And have it absorb them.

1354
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:58,090
Like so.

1355
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:01,890
Right?

1356
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:04,270
Hmm...

1357
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,270
Hmm...

1358
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,200
Double mint?

1359
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,220
I look like I'm wearing a thorn crown...

1360
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:15,440
Now.

1361
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:22,170
When did the DDT's come?

1362
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:23,350
In 90, right?

1363
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:30,310
I'm scared.

1364
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,330
I'm scared for those!

1365
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:34,970
90?

1366
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:35,750
Yeah, okay.

1367
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,470
Might be good...

1368
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:43,170
To have this guy kind of facing down.

1369
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:47,550
We can start working on our mega laser.

1370
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:49,010
Hmm...

1371
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:51,430
Which way do we want the laser?

1372
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:53,750
Hmm...

1373
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:56,070
Like if I go here...

1374
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:56,690
It'll be like...

1375
01:03:58,870 --> 01:03:59,350
Hmm...

1376
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:02,450
Also ships...

1377
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:03,730
This is all...

1378
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:04,450
This is all...

1379
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:07,970
This is all water, baby!

1380
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:08,610
Wait...

1381
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:10,390
Oh, I think because of my sleeve.

1382
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:12,530
Hmm...

1383
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:12,710
Hmm...

1384
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:14,950
We can own this map?

1385
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:16,110
Yeah!

1386
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:18,550
You can go play this map yourself.

1387
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:19,870
Just search Minto.

1388
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:21,110
Cute maid!

1389
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,050
Thank you!

1390
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,630
Let's go sweat.

1391
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:29,610
Probably, actually.

1392
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:31,850
Sweaty, sweaty, sweaty.

1393
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:33,690
Sweaty, sweaty, sweaty.

1394
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:35,690
Here, we'll get this guy.

1395
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:38,570
We'll put him like right here.

1396
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:40,190
And we'll do...

1397
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:41,730
We'll do...

1398
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:43,590
We'll do the pirate lord.

1399
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:49,230
Yeah!

1400
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,630
And the double shot.

1401
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,020
Oh, I heard a DDT!

1402
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:03,760
Oh!

1403
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,500
We're so good!

1404
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,300
We are so good!

1405
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,140
We're gonna make it all the way, everybody.

1406
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,280
I believe.

1407
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:15,940
We're gonna make it all the way!

1408
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,040
We're gonna make it all the way!

1409
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,100
A break shot.

1410
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:26,980
Don't jinx it.

1411
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,060
What if I just casually get to 200?

1412
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,820
Like, on just a one-off stream?

1413
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,240
Where I'm just playing...

1414
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:41,920
...

1415
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,160
...

1416
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:43,840
...

1417
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,520
...

1418
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:52,220
Yeah, I'm just playing Bloons just to, you know, hang out and play a game.

1419
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:53,740
I'm just playing Bloons.

1420
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:56,700
What about you?

1421
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,300
We need 29,000.

1422
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:00,760
What about you?

1423
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:01,440
You too.

1424
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,940
The super glue.

1425
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:03,980
You know what?

1426
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:04,880
Let's do the super glue.

1427
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,480
Autopilot gaming.

1428
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,620
It does make me really relaxed though when I play this game.

1429
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:18,540
And what I like is I can just kind of take a break in between like rounds.

1430
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,400
I can be like, I gotta go do something.

1431
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,520
And I'll leave and like just do it.

1432
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:26,260
It's kind of awesome.

1433
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,500
I stood around on the previous Minto map and died at 199.

1434
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:34,980
No way.

1435
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:38,140
What happened?

1436
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,740
Basically cookie clicker.

1437
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,140
There's a little more thought.

1438
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,940
Oh, I haven't checked on my cookies in a while.

1439
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:53,510
The BAD might be trouble.

1440
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:54,730
Yeah, I think so too.

1441
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:00,520
It's okay.

1442
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,240
We're gonna upgrade.

1443
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,300
We still have a few upgrades to do.

1444
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,420
Like these two can still upgrade.

1445
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:08,680
And this one can still upgrade.

1446
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,600
So we're focusing on upgrading.

1447
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:17,200
Which one do I want to do first?

1448
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:17,900
We'll get this guy.

1449
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:22,280
What does it do?

1450
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:22,440
What does it do anyway?

1451
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,640
Oh yeah, whenever MOA spawns, it like does a big ol' Yeah,

1452
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:32,210
we're upgrading.

1453
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:33,410
Don't worry, we're upgrading.

1454
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:36,550
Don't be a...

1455
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:41,470
Uh-oh.

1456
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:42,370
Uh-oh.

1457
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:44,310
What?

1458
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:50,840
What went past?

1459
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,100
Huh?

1460
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,740
I didn't even see anything!

1461
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:57,480
DDTs!

1462
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:01,700
I didn't even see them!

1463
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,860
I didn't even see them at all!

1464
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:17,170
Steelycraze keeps giving you a little... I think Steelycraze is flirting with you.

1465
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:22,610
Casually gets around 200.

1466
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:23,410
Okay, okay.

1467
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:24,790
Okay, okay.

1468
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:26,870
I see you.

1469
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:37,430
I will also give you one dancing RGB monkey.

1470
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:40,910
Offstream though, offstream.

1471
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:43,470
But I'll give you a monkey.

1472
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:46,710
Who is Steelycraze?

1473
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:48,090
I think... did they give this one too?

1474
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:51,970
Who gave it to you?

1475
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,710
Who gave this?

1476
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:04,990
Need some paragons to reach level 200?

1477
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:05,390
No!

1478
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:06,210
I believe!

1479
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:09,170
I believe we can go without it!

1480
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:11,690
I... I know... Oh wait.

1481
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:14,130
I know we can.

1482
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:15,650
But guys, it's time.

1483
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:19,490
It's time for the moment you've been waiting for!

1484
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:20,690
One!

1485
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:21,890
Two!

1486
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:23,190
Ready?

1487
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,530
Ice monkey...

1488
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:27,150
The

1489
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:40,810
music?

1490
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,060
Wait, can monkey...

1491
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:48,200
I have a question.

1492
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:53,560
Can monkey destroy... Ice monkey destroy bloons or...

1493
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:57,320
Does ice monkey only just freeze the bloons?

1494
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:01,900
Yes?

1495
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:02,900
The bottom path?

1496
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,660
But what if I never make any money?

1497
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:12,490
There's damage?

1498
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:12,930
Okay.

1499
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:14,830
All of them can pop?

1500
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:15,430
Okay, okay.

1501
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:16,650
So I'm just gonna put them out.

1502
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:21,590
Uh-oh.

1503
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:22,250
Wait.

1504
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:23,130
Ice Monkey.

1505
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:26,570
This music is crazy.

1506
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:28,250
Wait.

1507
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,030
I don't think Ice Monkey can...

1508
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:34,750
I don't think Ice Monkey can reach.

1509
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:38,230
Wait, where did the...

1510
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:40,730
I don't think Ice Monkey has...

1511
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:45,510
Two... Wait!

1512
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,410
Wait, it said they start over here!

1513
01:10:57,890 --> 01:11:01,070
Oh, they start here and then leave here.

1514
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:07,530
I managed to make it past round 200 without Paragon.

1515
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:08,470
So I believe he can do it.

1516
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:09,710
Also, I did it on company time.

1517
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:10,530
Let's go.

1518
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,510
Go Ice Monkey!

1519
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,030
Oh, he's slow.

1520
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:17,110
Oh, Ice Monkey.

1521
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:19,770
Oh, they circle multiple times.

1522
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:20,610
Oh, Ice Monkey!

1523
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:21,670
Ice Monkey, please!

1524
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:28,780
I can't pop Camel.

1525
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:30,020
I think.

1526
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:30,720
Uh-oh.

1527
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,140
Okay.

1528
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,880
I guess we'll do Ice Monkey plus Village.

1529
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,240
Enhanced Freezing.

1530
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:46,660
Tax Faster.

1531
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:47,440
That's what we need.

1532
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:49,740
Okay, buddy.

1533
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:52,100
Enhanced.

1534
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:52,960
Enhanced Ice Monkey.

1535
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:56,480
Man, we should go.

1536
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:56,940
Oh, Top Path.

1537
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:57,560
Oh, Top Path.

1538
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,700
Okay, well we're going to have so many Ice Monkeys, you guys.

1539
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:00,200
Like...

1540
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,720
We're going to be able to do every single path.

1541
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,840
It's got a nice crunch.

1542
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:13,900
Ice Monkey!

1543
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:15,960
Don't just juggle.

1544
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,300
You're losing lives.

1545
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:21,800
This one.

1546
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:23,860
Can freeze and pop.

1547
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:23,940
Pop!

1548
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:35,380
Super cold aura that slows bloons and freezes water nearby.

1549
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,140
Wait, this might be good, right?

1550
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,400
I'm gonna go for the bottom path though.

1551
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:42,920
For now.

1552
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:49,440
Guys, we might run out of lives before we...

1553
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:52,040
Maybe I should have put Ice Monkey in a different spot.

1554
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,620
But if we have to redo it, that's okay too.

1555
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,400
Because I just didn't know where the path was.

1556
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,120
Good job, Ice Monkey!

1557
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,000
0-2-5 is my way to go.

1558
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,460
Oh my gosh.

1559
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:11,280
Why are Ice Monkeys so expensive?

1560
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:20,980
Oh, come on!

1561
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:21,740
Come on!

1562
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,540
It's 425 and we're at 423!

1563
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,720
This is so messed up.

1564
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,200
Go Ice Monkey!

1565
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,220
Okay, I'm gonna slow it down.

1566
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,300
So we can make another Ice Monkey.

1567
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:39,670
Why can't I only put in some places and not others?

1568
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:40,890
Oh my god.

1569
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:41,390
Ice Monkey.

1570
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:42,110
Do something!

1571
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:04,540
Nice.

1572
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,340
Wow, six shades.

1573
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,880
You guys, the music is so fitting for this, honestly.

1574
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,000
Yeah.

1575
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,240
Get the Ice Mon...

1576
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,420
Wow, nice, nice.

1577
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:18,180
Oh my gosh.

1578
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,240
We're just bleeding.

1579
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,740
You guys, we're bleeding lives.

1580
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:25,860
Oh no, wait.

1581
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:26,860
That was the wrong monkey.

1582
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,680
Too many Ice Monkeys.

1583
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,560
I can't keep up with Ice Monkey.

1584
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:34,500
Okay.

1585
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:35,580
It's okay though.

1586
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1587
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1588
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:38,420
Oh, this is good.

1589
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:38,800
This is good.

1590
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1591
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:40,960
Nice, nice.

1592
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,320
Oh, this is good.

1593
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:42,660
This is good.

1594
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:43,220
Go, go!

1595
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,840
We only lost one life that time.

1596
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:48,060
Not enough Ice Monkey.

1597
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,400
Shoot smaller Ice Bombs.

1598
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,460
Increases Pierce.

1599
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:55,860
Okay.

1600
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,660
Let's go for that.

1601
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,080
But also, how do we want to go with this guy?

1602
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,060
Let's do that.

1603
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,140
Let's unlock this.

1604
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:06,300
Okay.

1605
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:10,340
Maybe I should have had Ice Monkey gain more XP.

1606
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,020
You guys, let's try and get to round 40.

1607
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,320
Let's try and get through the map, okay?

1608
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,480
That's what...

1609
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,660
That's what our goal will be.

1610
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:20,300
Okay.

1611
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:21,380
Okay.

1612
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,980
That's what the goal will be.

1613
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:23,960
Just get through the map.

1614
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,360
Get through...

1615
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,040
Get through the map.

1616
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,560
Oh, my God.

1617
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,580
I was so poor.

1618
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:34,020
I need more money.

1619
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:38,800
Okay, nice.

1620
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,060
Look, they're working together.

1621
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,060
They're really working together.

1622
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:42,900
Ice.

1623
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:43,560
Ice.

1624
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:44,520
Ice.

1625
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:45,300
Ice.

1626
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:45,960
Ice.

1627
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:46,560
Ice.

1628
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,200
Yeah!

1629
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,800
Clap, Monkey, clap!

1630
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,080
Oh, oh, oh.

1631
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:51,940
Oh, my God.

1632
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,320
Oh, my God.

1633
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,320
Clap, clap, clap, clap.

1634
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:53,420
Oh, my God.

1635
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,380
Clap, clap, clap.

1636
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:54,940
Oh, shoot.

1637
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,360
Okay, that's fine.

1638
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:58,720
Keep going.

1639
01:15:58,900 --> 01:15:59,160
Keep going.

1640
01:15:59,320 --> 01:15:59,700
Clap.

1641
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:01,840
Clap.

1642
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:03,140
Clap, Monkey!

1643
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:03,420
Clap!

1644
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,180
Deep freeze.

1645
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,200
It's getting breezy in here.

1646
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,440
It's getting breezy.

1647
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:27,330
Nice.

1648
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:28,590
I like the sound they make.

1649
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:29,250
It's really crunchy.

1650
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:31,550
No juggling?

1651
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:33,910
They juggle on their own time.

1652
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:36,930
They juggle when they have time.

1653
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:37,290
I like that.

1654
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:47,160
I wish, though, I put Monkey over here, Monkey here, you know?

1655
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:49,160
I wish I could also put Monkey out here.

1656
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:51,960
We got to get them all.

1657
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,920
Maybe I just, like, spam Monkey in here.

1658
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,820
Let's put Monkey over here.

1659
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,600
First Monkey defense.

1660
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:07,640
Ain't making it.

1661
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,440
What are you talking about?

1662
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:09,220
I'm not making it.

1663
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:09,500
I'm not making it.

1664
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,520
We're going to make it.

1665
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:12,020
Go.

1666
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:14,600
See?

1667
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:15,100
He's getting some.

1668
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:15,760
Oh.

1669
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,780
The yellow ones, we don't care about those.

1670
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,540
They can leave.

1671
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:21,620
They're not invited.

1672
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:24,320
Is this the dark blue water?

1673
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,420
I'm actually not sure.

1674
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,640
I think this is definitely water.

1675
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,560
I can't tell until we make more money.

1676
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,700
This guy can go with...

1677
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:48,280
Attack's faster.

1678
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:49,860
We'll go with this one.

1679
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,400
You're doing it.

1680
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:01,160
Kind of.

1681
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:01,920
Oh my God.

1682
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,300
We've lost so many lives.

1683

01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,500
Someone is not doing their job!

1737
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:58,070
It looks like Ice Monkey has really stupid googly eyes.

1738
01:20:02,530 --> 01:20:03,770
I'm Ice Monkey!

1739
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:09,070

01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:11,690
I've popped the balloon!

1744
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,320
Oh, it's so over.

1745
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,500
The disrespect of that one red balloon.

1746
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,240
Hold on, let's restart.

1747
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:43,860
Let's restart.

1748
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:49,320
We have... We are... 22 is the new 40.

1749
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:54,000
We are... We are... We are stronger now.

1750
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:59,120
I tried doing this with just Ice Monkey and couldn't do it so I gave up because one type of balloon.

1751
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,620
That's why I failed.

1752
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:05,620
It's okay.

1753
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:06,340
It's only three.

1754
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:07,080
It's only three.

1755
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:07,740
It's only three.

1756
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:12,540
Next.

1757
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:19,330
There we go.

1758
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:20,170
Nice.

1759
01:21:20,650 --> 01:21:21,090
Nice.

1760
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:21,730
Nice.

1761
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:22,450
Yep.

1762
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:24,950
Yes.

1763
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:25,390
Yes.

1764
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:26,450
Yes.

1765
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:26,810
Yes.

1766
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:27,130
Yes...

1767
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:33,810
Oh...

1768
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:38,050
He was frozen and then...

1769
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:39,570
And then he wasn't.

1770
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:41,330
Don't judel at a time like this.

1771
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:41,990
It's embarrassing.

1772
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:43,990
Enhanced freeze.

1773
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:47,010
Thanks for the laughs.

1774
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:50,570
Thanks for laughing AbbeyKrew.

1775
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:54,130

01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:56,790

1777
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:57,110
All in?

1778
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:00,230
Okay, I think I'm gonna go all in on two monkeys.

1779
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:02,450
I think having two is good.

1780
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:06,770
I think... anymore... I won't have enough money.

1781
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:09,730
You know what I mean?

1782
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:13,790
I think I need to go in on two monkeys.

1783
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:20,120
For now.

1784
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:22,620
Until we can hold our own.

1785
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:23,520
You know?

1786
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:28,480
You're in for a bad time once the white bloons show up.

1787
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,740
But this one can...

1788
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,040
One of them...

1789
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,720
One of them will work?

1790
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:37,000
Right!

1791
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:41,060
One of these will be able to take care of it!

1792
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:42,200
Right!

1793
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,080
Look, we're already doing so much better than before!

1794
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:52,500
Look, we're already doing so much better than before!

1795
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:55,740

1802
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:00,620
No!

1803
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,260
Red bloon!

1804
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:06,460
Get him!

1805
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:07,180
Yeah!

1806
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,400
I uh... went against my...

1807
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,100
We're gonna give this guy...

1808
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:20,380
I don't know.

1809
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,840
We're just gonna... he's our backup.

1810
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:22,840
He's our backup monkey.

1811
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:27,600
We're saving up for... this one.

1812
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,780
Rapidly shoot smaller ice bombs.

1813
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:32,420
We're saving up.

1814
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:32,920
We're saving up.

1815
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:34,060
Ship!

1816
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:34,520

1817
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:35,740
Ship!bridge!

1818
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,060
Tail seep.

1819
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:37,660
It's gonna die.

1820
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:38,740
Now he's looking down.

1821
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:39,100
Yeah.

1822
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:46,300
In disgust to... Disgust to... how disappointed he is.

1823
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,400
Oh my god.

1824
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:50,840
No!!!

1825
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,300
Come on!!

1826
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,580
That can do it!

1827
01:23:55,700 --> 01:24:00,790
Finished using Next to that- like here?

1828
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:01,730
In the crease.

1829
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:02,070
Save.

1830
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:03,530
Hold on, that's a good idea.

1831
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:05,210
I'm going to sell him.

1832
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:07,630
Put him here.

1833
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:09,730
You're so right.

1834
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:14,610
Top of the eye would be better.

1835
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:16,010
Is it?

1836
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:21,410
Every game we learn a new... Why aren't you doing anything?

1837
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:22,490
Pop him!

1838
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:26,490
I'm saving up.

1839
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:27,790
I'm saving up for the cryo...

1840
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:30,790
Okay.

1841
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:33,190
So he's looking up.

1842
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:35,790
Things are looking up from here.

1843
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:41,110
This guy can't even reach larger... There we go.

1844
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:42,190
Goodness gracious.

1845
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:45,470
What's this one?

1846
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:47,890
Oh, let's do this.

1847
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:54,130
I said I was saving up.

1848
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:54,770
4, 4, 4!

1849
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:56,890
Oh my god.

1850
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:58,270
It's so fast.

1851
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:00,430
You're so slow.

1852
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:03,370
Why are you so...

1853
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,530
You can't even hit that guy.

1854
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:08,370
Solid snake eyes.

1855
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:08,950
Fuck you.

1856
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:15,490
Oh my god.

1857
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:16,050
Oh god.

1858
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:16,810
You're too slow.

1859
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:21,150
Oh, he's going to get this guy though.

1860
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:27,470
We're still at 169.

1861
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:30,090
8.

1862
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:40,820
Okay.

1863
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,200
Maybe I should just restart then.

1864
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,380
I want to see what this does.

1865
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,180
Cryo cannon.

1866
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,420
If we can even get there.

1867
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:48,740
Oh.

1868
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,440
Single red, blue.

1869
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:52,600
Okay.

1870
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:53,360
Go, go, go.

1871
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,580
It's always that one blue and I know, right?

1872
01:25:58,140 --> 01:25:58,700
Come on.

1873
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:00,220
Oh, they're regenerating.

1874
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:01,500
Everything is bad.

1875
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,200
Everything sucks.

1876
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:04,500
Here it is.

1877
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,080
There it goes.

1878
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:06,320
148!

1879
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,820
Were they close to it?

1880
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:13,960
So I just want to see what it does.

1881
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:14,820
Okay.

1882
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:17,800
Oh my god.

1883
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:18,060
Oh my god.

1884
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:18,180
Nice.

1885
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,240
Nice.

1886
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:20,320
Everybody.

1887
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:21,880
We're so close.

1888
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:22,820
This round.

1889
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:23,180
This round.

1890
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,320
We got this.

1891
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,220
Spieve, everybody.

1892
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:35,900
Oh, dang it.

1893
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:36,120
Okay.

1894
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:36,400
Next.

1895
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:36,740
Oh.

1896
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:38,080
There we go.

1897
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:39,600
Let's try it out.

1898
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:41,500
Wait.

1899
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:43,100
Are these the guys that...

1900
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:52,130
Oh, he can't even get all the yellow ones though.

1901
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:52,810
Okay.

1902
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:53,870
Let's go.

1903
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,240
You're so slow.

1904
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:04,560
He's kind of awesome...

1905
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,260
Oh, here we go.

1906
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,300
Guys.

1907
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:24,240
Guys.

1908
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,980
I think this challenge is impossible!

1909
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:33,990
I think this challenge...

1910
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,320
It's on easy difficulty!

1911
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:42,160
I think this challenge is impossible!

1912
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,850
What are the white ones?

1913
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:50,430
Are they...

1914
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:52,610
Are you feeling 22?

1915
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:00,480
What do the white balloons count as?

1916
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,500
I don't even think I've ever considered what they are.

1917
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,580
The white ones cannot be frozen.

1918
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,240
Free as a mule!

1919
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:13,220
Oh, immune to ice.

1920
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,120
That's why I never knew.

1921
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:29,290
This ice monkey map is probably made by an ice monkey hater.

1922
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,500
Oh my god!

1923
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:47,160
Guys, I don't even know if we would be able to afford...

1924
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,380
I don't think we could afford it.

1925
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:53,740
Like...

1926
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:58,700
I don't think we could afford an ice monkey getting as good as it did before.

1927
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:01,280
And then also...

1928
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,000
You always use...

1929
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,560
Oh, oh, oh, ice monkey!

1930
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,340
Look, look, like...

1931
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:11,360
Let's see...

1932
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,500
Oh, gosh!

1933
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:16,180
Cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha!

1934
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:17,180
Cha!

1935
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:19,080
A village is 1,020.

1936
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,380
And then in the middle, right?

1937
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:24,220
6,000!

1938
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:29,760
There's no way.

1939
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:39,760
There's no way we'd get there in time with also upgrading a monkey.

1940
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,920
Oh no, is this challenge impossible?

1941
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:54,420
No!

1942
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,460
Is this challenge impossible?

1943
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,740
Get a dart, monkey.

1944
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:04,780
That's not the point!

1945
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:07,340
The challenge is ice monkey only!

1946
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,100
Oh, no!

1947
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:28,750
Snowstorm.

1948
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:30,510
Freeze all regular bloons on screen.

1949
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:31,610
Briefly freezes.

1950
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:33,350
Why zebra camo and slows mo...

1951
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:33,570
Wow.

1952
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:42,350
Let's try putting the ice monkey at the top.

1953
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:46,770
Hmm...

1954
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:47,210
Oh, wait.

1955
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,550
Hold on.

1956
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:50,350
Oh, I need the larger...

1957
01:30:50,350 --> 01:30:51,630
The larger radius is 150.

1958
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:54,550
Will I have enough?

1959
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:57,750
Like here?

1960
01:30:59,050 --> 01:30:59,530
Yes.

1961
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:00,490
Nice.

1962
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:00,810
Okay.

1963
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:09,560
Go!

1964
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:10,480
Go!

1965
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:11,160
Go!

1966
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:18,250
Not a single life lost, baby!

1967
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:36,220
Oh, my God.

1968
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:37,020
Oh, my God.

1969
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,300
We're making it out of the ice age with this one.

1970
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:39,380
Oh, my God.

1971
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:39,460
Oh, my God.

1972
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:41,080
Don't get your hopes up.

1973
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:43,440
Huh!

1974
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:44,020
Huh!

1975
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:44,820
Huh!

1976
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:45,360
Huh!

1977
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:45,800
Huh!

1978
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:47,760
Huh!

1979
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:50,560
We're on round three and we still have 200 lives, everybody.

1980
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,020
Huge!

1981
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:53,680
Huge!

1982
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:54,700
Huge!

1983
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:55,940
Huge!

1984
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,600
Then we just get the deep freeze.

1985
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:03,400
No!

1986
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:04,080
Oh!

1987
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:04,700
Oh!

1988
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:05,400
Oh!

1989
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:06,040
Oh!

1990
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:06,080
Oh!

1991
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,220
Oh, my God.

1992
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:08,280
I like the crunchy sounds.

1993
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:08,820
Me too!

1994
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:11,320
Sounds really good.

1995
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:14,180
I'm going to start using ice monkey all the time.

1996
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:16,160
Yeah!

1997
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:16,660
Yeah!

1998
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:17,160
Yeah!

1999
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:24,320
She's a master of only one element.

2000
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,220
Three months for ice monkey!

2001
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:27,960
I did it!

2002
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:28,380
Thank you!

2003
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:29,800
Yeah!

2004
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:36,540
Wait.

2005
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:36,940
Hold on.

2006
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:00,500
Oh!

2007
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,900
That's the good stuff!

2008
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:06,140
That's the...

2009
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:23,530
It sounds like it's going to be...

2010
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:26,810
It's going through every crevice of my brain wrinkles.

2011
01:33:27,490 --> 01:33:28,750
Oh, my God.

2012
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:30,470
Oh, my gosh.

2013
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:33,250
I wish I could make the clapping a little less loud, but...

2014
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:34,930
Oh, yeah.

2015
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:35,990
Go through my brain.

2016
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:41,490
Crackle!

2017
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:42,610
Yeah.

2018
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:44,970
Ice monkey ASMR.

2019
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:46,470
Yeah.

2020
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:51,490
Next model ice monkey cosplay.

2021
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:52,970
What are you talking about?

2022
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:53,530
Oh, my God.

2023
01:33:53,530 --> 01:33:55,030
You have brain wrinkles?

2024
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:56,990
Oh, sorry.

2025
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:58,710
I know that's a foreign concept to you.

2026
01:33:58,870 --> 01:33:59,270
Yeah.

2027
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:00,590
Most brains...

2028
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:01,230
Hold on.

2029
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:03,130
I'll say this really slowly for you, Kason.

2030
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:13,110
Brains that think brain think thinking wrinkles.

2031
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:17,830
No wrinkle, no think.

2032
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:19,070
You?

2033
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:21,110
No wrinkle.

2034
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:23,390
You monkey brain.

2035
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:26,990
You think like monkey.

2036
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:29,530
But mint?

2037
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:32,250
Really wrinkly.

2038
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:35,550
No sunscreen ever.

2039
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:37,890
No skin care.

2040
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:40,390
Only wrinkle.

2041
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:48,160
Hag monkey.

2042
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:49,980
Hag monkey.

2043
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,360
Hag monkey.

2044
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,740
Hag monkey.

2045
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,120
No think.

2046
01:34:57,940 --> 01:34:59,220
I mean only...

2047
01:34:59,220 --> 01:34:59,900
Wait.

2048
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,080
Only wrinkles.

2049
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,340
Hag monkey.

2050
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:07,160
Only...

2051
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:07,460
Oh, gosh.

2052
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,300
We lost.

2053
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:13,940
We lost one, boys.

2054
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:15,920
We lost one.

2055
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:18,280
But...

2056
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:36,780
I don't think we're going to make enough money in time, though.

2057
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,680
Have you used any of your knowledge points?

2058
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:41,380
You can make ideas out of them.

2059
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:43,780
But still, I think that you can get an ice monkey stronger if you wanted to, or other monkeys.

2060
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,160
I haven't used a single monkey point.

2061
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:47,880
Ever.

2062
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,040
What is this map?

2063
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,000
It's ice monkey map, baby.

2064
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:12,920
We're not going to make enough money.

2065
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:20,340
I don't have money for a monkey, but I'll do my best to make enough for a mon... key.

2066
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:22,760
Your brain is smooth.

2067
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:26,060
No, you are brain is smooth.

2068
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:33,640
We've only lost a little bit of lives, but that's okay.

2069
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,540
I think you need another ice monkey.

2070
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:38,520
We won't have any money.

2071
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:42,820
It would cost so much to get zero... zero... wait.

2072
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:49,700
It would cost much less to get zero four ice than to get zero three... oh wait.

2073
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:52,080
What's zero four... wait.

2074
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:55,860
I can't even get the four though!

2075
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,280
I don't have enough EXP!

2076
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,100
I don't have enough.

2077
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:09,280
Bold words come from the ghost who said the difference between 181 and 187 is five at the beginning of the stream.

2078
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:12,260
You're making fun of me!

2079
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,180
You're making fun of my dyscalculia!

2080
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,620
I have a learning disability!

2081
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:19,880
You're gonna make some fun of someone with a learning disability?

2082
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:23,980
Mint color for mint, okay?

2083
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:24,620
Yeah,

2084
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:41,590
we're gonna have to train ice monkey to redo... I think we're gonna have to do a...

2085
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:43,410
We're gonna have to...

2086
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:45,930
Do like a revenge for this.

2087
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:50,170
We're gonna have to revenge.

2088
01:37:54,730 --> 01:37:56,390
Yellow is just flying by.

2089
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:57,630
Don't look at them.

2090
01:37:58,390 --> 01:37:59,950
Yellow is a horrible color.

2091
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:06,080
Two thousand.

2092
01:38:13,870 --> 01:38:14,830
It's impossible.

2093
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:16,870
It's really impossible.

2094
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:22,770
So then what...

2095
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:25,710
What is black bloons?

2096
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:27,930
What are they immune to?

2097
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:31,770
Green is not a creative color.

2098
01:38:31,890 --> 01:38:32,590
What are you talking about?

2099
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:37,890
There's like only three green VTubers.

2100
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:38,370
Okay.

2101
01:38:39,770 --> 01:38:40,810
Oh, explosions.

2102
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:43,270
Oh my gosh.

2103
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:43,990
Here it is.

2104
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:45,590
My demise.

2105
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:48,890
Here we go.

2106
01:38:49,150 --> 01:38:49,410
Bye.

2107
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:50,670
Bye.

2108
01:38:50,890 --> 01:38:51,010
Bye.

2109
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:54,390
Bye.

2110
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:54,810
Bye.

2111
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:54,910
Bye.

2112
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:55,030
Bye.

2113
01:38:55,030 --> 01:38:55,190
Bye.

2114
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:00,620
Bye.

2115
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:00,700
Bye.

2116
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:03,060
Bye.

2117
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:04,180
Yo, super chat.

2118
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:08,340
Man.

2119
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:09,040
Oh well.

2120
01:39:21,210 --> 01:39:22,030
Monkey money!

2121
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:25,270
I wanna get to the... where's the...

2122
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:35,210
I have 33 monkey points.

2123
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:38,770
Yo, you can't see cause chat's blocking it.

2124
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:39,930
I have 33 of them.

2125
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:43,770
Wait.

2126
01:39:44,110 --> 01:39:45,830
Oh well, I haven't used any of them.

2127
01:39:46,330 --> 01:39:49,150
I was like enable monkey knowledge, but I don't use it.

2128
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:55,470
Try Corvus.

2129
01:39:56,130 --> 01:39:56,870
Where's that guy?

2130
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:01,130
Which one is him?

2131
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:01,590
Him?

2132
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:03,530
Oh yeah!

2133
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:05,410
I don't have enough money.

2134
01:40:07,310 --> 01:40:08,230
I don't have enough.

2135
01:40:09,610 --> 01:40:10,290
Look at...

2136
01:40:10,830 --> 01:40:11,490
Is this you?

2137
01:40:13,570 --> 01:40:14,590
Is that you?

2138
01:40:15,970 --> 01:40:17,030
You're like...

2139
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:18,950
Monkey!

2140
01:40:19,830 --> 01:40:23,470
Is that you?

2141
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:30,450
Literally me.

2142
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:34,430
He's got Venom's hand.

2143
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:39,890
He stole your color.

2144
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:41,790
What?

2145
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:43,410
The little wisp guy?

2146
01:40:44,050 --> 01:40:48,310
I mean, basically all ghosts are either a shade of green or blue.

2147
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:51,850
It's like ghost lore.

2148
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:52,530
Everybody...

2149
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:54,090
Every ghost has to be green or blue.

2150
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:57,750
That's just the way.

2151
01:40:58,110 --> 01:40:59,270
Wait, so is he a ghost?

2152
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:00,770
A spirit walker.

2153
01:41:02,630 --> 01:41:04,350
Corvus works well on the front line.

2154
01:41:04,470 --> 01:41:10,450
Weakening nearby bloons to harvest mana and challenge powerful energies through his spirit companion.

2155
01:41:11,610 --> 01:41:12,490
Or white.

2156
01:41:12,690 --> 01:41:14,010
Oh yeah, white's fine too.

2157
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:16,690
White's also good.

2158
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:18,810
Oh, purple?

2159
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:20,130
Purple's also fine.

2160
01:41:21,030 --> 01:41:21,510
Because...

2161
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:23,030
Gengar, you know.

2162
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:27,450
Luigi's Mansion is fiction.

2163
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:29,530
Those are all paid actors.

2164
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:33,950
Luigi's Mansion doesn't count.

2165
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:37,010
Luigi is a fraud.

2166
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:38,790
He's a big old phony.

2167
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:42,030
He's just like, oh, I'm a ghost hunter.

2168
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:42,750
No, he's not.

2169
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:45,130
Those guys are literally there to be sucked...

2170
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:46,150
up...

2171
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:47,290
into a vacuum.

2172
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:52,170
Why do you hate Luigi?

2173
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:55,550
Because...

2174
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:58,050
I don't hate Luigi.

2175
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:01,410
I just hate that he's a phony.

2176
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:12,700
Green envy.

2177
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:15,780
What about Ghostbusters?

2178
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:17,280
Aren't those guys green?

2179
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:22,830
Aren't those guys green?

2180
01:42:22,830 --> 01:42:22,970
Main screen!

2181
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:27,070
Poor Luigi!

2182
01:42:29,450 --> 01:42:31,150
Mint a Wario fan?

2183
01:42:31,730 --> 01:42:34,030
I'm a WaLuigi fan.

2184
01:42:34,450 --> 01:42:36,810
Maybe that's why I'm a Luigi hater?

2185
01:42:38,630 --> 01:42:41,390
I'm like WaLuigi.

2186
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:44,130
I like Waluigi.

2187
01:42:44,850 --> 01:42:46,870
But can I be the wah-Luigi?

2188
01:42:47,590 --> 01:42:49,490
He's the correct answer!

2189
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:51,110
Oh, that's worse?

2190
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:54,090
How is that worse?

2191
01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:58,210
Luigi is just like a little weenie.

2192
01:42:58,670 --> 01:43:00,630
He's just like, oh brother.

2193
01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:02,830
Mama mia.

2194
01:43:06,650 --> 01:43:09,690
And Mario is fine.

2195
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:11,650
Actually, I hate Mario.

2196
01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:13,490
I hate Mario.

2197
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:18,740
I hate that guy.

2198
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:21,440
Mario can...

2199
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:24,100
Mario can get stuck in a pipe.

2200
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:33,390
Okay, Bowser.

2201
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:36,510
Yeah, Bowser!

2202
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:40,830
My name is Mario?

2203
01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:42,250
Is it actually?

2204
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:48,350
Is it actually?

2205
01:43:59,210 --> 01:44:00,310
King Boo confirmed.

2206
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:01,590
Yeah!

2207
01:44:01,590 --> 01:44:02,690
I love King Boo!

2208
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:03,770
I love Boo!

2209
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:09,180
What is your favorite monkey hero?

2210
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:13,860
And why is it Sada in this skin?

2211
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:18,820
I'm gonna need some coffee.

2212
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:20,200
Hold on, I'm gonna have a snack.

2213
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:25,020
No, this is the chocolate one!

2214
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:25,940
I want a peanut butter!

2215
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:27,300
No!

2216
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,020
Wait guys, I gotta go get a peanut butter.

2217
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:30,480
Peanut butter bar.

2218
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:31,900
Give me a second.

2219
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,720
I have a chocolate bar, but I want a peanut butter bar.

2220
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:35,640
Give me one second.

2221
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:37,140
Give me one second!

2222
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:38,320
I'm gonna run and grab it.

2223
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:39,400
It's in my kitchen.

2224
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,000
It's in my kitchen.

2225
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:41,840
I'll be back in one second.

2226
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:42,520
Give me one second.

2227
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:44,900
Pat firsty.

2228
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:46,840
Pat firsty.

2229
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,520
Pat firsty.

2230
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:49,960
One second.

2231
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:50,560
One second!

2232
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:53,110
I also got a cookie sandow.

2233
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:54,930
Yeah!

2234
01:45:56,250 --> 01:45:57,050
Tokyo banana.

2235
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:59,010
Cookie sandow.

2236
01:45:59,370 --> 01:46:00,710
It says cookie sand.

2237
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:02,830
I'm gonna try this.

2238
01:46:02,970 --> 01:46:04,470
I don't think I've had this yet.

2239
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:07,250
Yummy.

2240
01:46:08,470 --> 01:46:09,050
Whoa!

2241
01:46:09,390 --> 01:46:11,710
It's just got a big ol' slice of...

2242
01:46:12,970 --> 01:46:14,010
Smells like banana.

2243
01:46:14,370 --> 01:46:14,830
And cookie.

2244
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:17,210
Exactly as advertised!

2245
01:46:18,990 --> 01:46:20,450
Men, eat peanut butter!

2246
01:46:24,230 --> 01:46:25,790
You can't make me!

2247
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:29,010
But I do have a peanut butter bar.

2248
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:46,840
Peanut butter is made for monkeys.

2249
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:53,920
Is it a nature valley sweet and salty chewy nut bar?

2250
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:55,980
No, it's a...

2251
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:01,790
It's a...

2252
01:47:03,790 --> 01:47:05,370
Gamer shop suss bar.

2253
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:22,640
What are you doing over there Scooby Snack?

2254
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:25,780
Just call the boober.

2255
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:32,800
Why do you sound so upset?

2256
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:34,100
Because you guys will judge me!

2257
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:35,620
Was it free?

2258
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:36,280
Yeah.

2259
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,020
They're literally feeding this girl.

2260
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:45,400
They're feeding me!

2261
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:50,140
It's a sustainable, nutritious food bar!

2262
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,180
And it's peanut butter flavored.

2263
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:01,980
And it was free!

2264
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:05,880
Peanut butter!

2265
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,220
And it's peanut butter and free!

2266
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:11,900
How can I say no?

2267
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,660
Free food tastes better.

2268
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:14,360
Exactly!

2269
01:48:28,330 --> 01:48:29,210
Shut up, Murphy.

2270
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:39,090
Why does me being goofy have to do with starving?

2271
01:48:41,990 --> 01:48:42,930
Yeah, free food!

2272
01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:45,250
My only thing about this bar...

2273
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:48,630
Is it tastes like the peanut butter...

2274
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:52,650
The peanut butter that's like Japanese peanut butter.

2275
01:48:52,890 --> 01:48:55,110
Which is just, for some reason, very sweet.

2276
01:48:59,330 --> 01:49:00,370
Let's um...

2277
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:04,890
I don't really like sweet peanut butter.

2278
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:14,760
Isn't Japanese mayo sweet as well?

2279
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,540
It can be, yeah.

2280
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:18,200
They like... like the bread is sweet.

2281
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:20,540
The peanut butter is sweet.

2282
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:24,420
I don't want so much sweet all the time.

2283
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:27,600
Which is so funny because people are like, Oh, Japanese food is not sweet.

2284
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:28,560
It's so like...

2285
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:29,820
You know, it's so bland.

2286
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:31,960
And I'm like, no, it's sweet!

2287
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:34,940
How did I get to the...

2288
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:37,380
Was it this?

2289
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:38,000
Oh, here we go.

2290
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:41,780
Let's look up the most liked.

2291
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:44,080
Some of these are like serious...

2292
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:45,280
This one is...

2293
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:47,280
This one is so funny.

2294
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:48,300
Sada's best map.

2295
01:49:53,690 --> 01:49:54,730
It's so funny.

2296
01:49:58,530 --> 01:50:00,250
But some of these are like real art.

2297
01:50:00,350 --> 01:50:01,450
Look at jungly wongly.

2298
01:50:01,910 --> 01:50:02,850
What the hell?

2299
01:50:04,310 --> 01:50:06,130
Nothing gets past my axe, boy.

2300
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:10,590
My wish order is shipping route.

2301
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:10,870
Hahaha.

2302
01:50:14,730 --> 01:50:15,810
Jungly wongly.

2303
01:50:19,330 --> 01:50:19,990
Inception.

2304
01:50:20,150 --> 01:50:20,270
Whoa!

2305
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:26,510
Vaporeon's garden.

2306
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:33,120
Kronko would like that one.

2307
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:35,100
Among Us Among Us!

2308
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:37,220
Mega Man's map.

2309
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:39,340
Oh wait, that's not actual Mega Man.

2310
01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:46,240
Oh, there's Maxwell.

2311
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:48,240
I like this one already.

2312
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:50,340
Some of these are so awesome.

2313
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:52,320
Blondes.

2314
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:54,240
Blondes if it was good.

2315
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,320
First monkey shooter.

2316
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:07,220
Plants vs.

2317
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:08,580
Blondes!

2318
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:10,940
Shut up.

2319
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:13,960
Oh my god!

2320
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:14,700
Oh my god!

2321
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:16,400
No way!

2322
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:21,140
Wait, what?

2323
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:23,500
How does this work?

2324
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:28,420
Huh?

2325
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:30,640
Huh?

2326
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:31,240
Huh?

2327
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,680
I'm just gonna put it right here.

2328
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:37,520
I don't know where they're gonna come from.

2329
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:40,240
They're from all over!

2330
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:42,080
They're from all over!

2331
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,340
Oh.

2332
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:45,580
Oof.

2333
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:47,540
Hahaha.

2334
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:48,940
Hahaha.

2335
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:53,100
There's a monkey on your lawn.

2336
01:51:54,060 --> 01:51:57,280
There's a monkey on your lawn.

2337
01:51:58,520 --> 01:51:59,600
There's a monkey on your lawn.

2338
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:00,120
Sunflower.

2339
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:08,110
I'm done with this one.

2340
01:52:08,510 --> 01:52:09,570
Go home.

2341
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:13,970
That one seems hard.

2342
01:52:14,630 --> 01:52:16,150
There's another one!

2343
01:52:17,290 --> 01:52:18,090
What the hell?

2344
01:52:18,110 --> 01:52:19,570
They're made by two different people!

2345
01:52:20,670 --> 01:52:21,590
Plants vs.

2346
01:52:21,630 --> 01:52:22,210
Zombies.

2347
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:42,920
You think he'd be able to reach everyone?

2348
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:46,060
He might be able to.

2349
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:48,960
Four paths now.

2350
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:50,780
Look, they come over.

2351
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:52,020
This is so genius!

2352
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:52,740
What?

2353
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,480
What the hell?

2354
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:57,780
This is just so...

2355
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:00,020
It just is so...

2356
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:01,200
So good!

2357
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:01,880
So well made!

2358
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:06,420
Let's try if I...

2359
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:06,720
Oh wait.

2360
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:10,000
Maybe like right here.

2361
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,500
Let's see if it works.

2362
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:12,620
Go!

2363
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:13,040
Go!

2364
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:26,480
Nice.

2365
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:31,020
His reach.

2366
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:32,880
I

2367
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:40,040
think I realize what this stream has made me realize.

2368
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:45,380
I think I need a break from Bloons.

2369
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:49,740
I feel like I'm like...

2370
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,400
Oh yeah, Bloons.

2371
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:53,400
Yeah, I played it.

2372
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:53,780
Okay.

2373
01:53:54,700 --> 01:53:55,920
I think I'm like...

2374
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:56,720
I think I'm not...

2375
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:58,060
I think I'm like kinda...

2376
01:53:58,060 --> 01:53:59,680
I'm Bloonsed out a little bit.

2377
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:03,900
No such thing.

2378
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:05,480
Yeah, I'm Bloonsed out.

2379
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:06,720
Plants vs.

2380
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:07,680
Zombies next stream.

2381
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:10,180
Seeing this, I was just like more excited about the Plants vs.

2382
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:12,120
Zombies than the Bloons.

2383
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:17,640
But I'm really curious how this one gets with like the MOABs.

2384
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:18,260
Where do they... what?

2385
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,220
Do four MOABs come out and stuff?

2386
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:23,280
I'm so curious how it'll work.

2387
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:23,960
We'll keep playing.

2388
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:24,720
We'll keep playing for now.

2389
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:31,380
We'll keep trying it for now.

2390
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:35,560
Four MOABs.

2391
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:36,260
Oh my...

2392
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:40,740
But you get like a ton of money from this though, right?

2393
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,380
Like, there's so many here.

2394
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:45,060
Let's... for this guy, let's go with the Pirate.

2395
01:54:46,540 --> 01:54:46,940
Oh.

2396
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:48,500
Well, I spent all my money.

2397
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:49,040
Nevermind.

2398
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:52,820
This guy...

2399
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:54,180
This guy will go for the top one.

2400
01:54:57,860 --> 01:55:00,060
I just got here and you're already tired of it.

2401
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:01,080
I'm sorry!

2402
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:08,140
Here is where I'm gonna put an airplane.

2403
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:10,020
When I can afford it.

2404
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:14,060
Same amount of Bloons, just different tracks.

2405
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:15,480
Seriously?

2406
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:16,860
Okay.

2407
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:18,240
It is the same amount though?

2408
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:19,420
It looks like so much more.

2409
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:21,140
Is this actually how many Bloons I've been...

2410
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:23,380
I've been shooting this whole time?

2411
01:55:23,620 --> 01:55:24,120
That's crazy.

2412
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:27,840
These little monkeys are so powerful.

2413
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:31,760
Look at him go.

2414
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:33,520
Don't forget the sunflower.

2415
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:36,380
Yeah, the sunflower will bring us more money.

2416
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:38,920
Cool.

2417
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:51,530
Each lane houses a quarter of the Bloons in each round.

2418
01:55:51,610 --> 01:55:52,070
So it would be...

2419
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:54,290
Only one MOAB on the first lane.

2420
01:55:54,450 --> 01:55:55,510
Oh, place in the editor.

2421
01:55:56,230 --> 01:55:57,170
Okay, okay, okay.

2422
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:01,350
Yeah, because these new custom maps are pretty recent.

2423
01:56:02,370 --> 01:56:04,190
So I don't know so much about them yet.

2424
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:11,780
Let's do...

2425
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:12,780
Let's do double shot.

2426
01:56:25,070 --> 01:56:26,710
We'll just keep upgrading this guy.

2427
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:28,690
Nice.

2428
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:30,030
I wanna...

2429
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:31,630
I wanna see how it looks.

2430
01:56:31,670 --> 01:56:32,590
Look at all these zombies.

2431
01:56:34,590 --> 01:56:36,570
It would be fun if I had like a...

2432
01:56:36,570 --> 01:56:38,770
You know how like they make skins for the Bloons?

2433
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:40,610
It would be fun if I like...

2434
01:56:41,110 --> 01:56:42,890
Had one that made it like kind of...

2435
01:56:42,890 --> 01:56:44,130
Dead looking.

2436
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:47,850
No, that is not Mega Man.

2437
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:49,130
No, that is not Mega Man.

2438
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:55,710
Dear Mint, I hope this message finds you well.

2439
01:56:55,870 --> 01:56:58,810
By the time this Donut Alert appeared, I found the Tuturu Gacha.

2440
01:56:59,050 --> 01:56:59,590
I'm asleep.

2441
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:01,490
Good night!

2442
01:57:05,930 --> 01:57:07,650
Oh, I thought I lost a life.

2443
01:57:07,710 --> 01:57:08,170
But I didn't.

2444
01:57:08,230 --> 01:57:08,730
I think it...

2445
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:09,670
Oh, yes I did.

2446
01:57:11,770 --> 01:57:15,570
I think I lost a some...

2447
01:57:19,590 --> 01:57:20,070
...

2448
01:57:20,070 --> 01:57:20,170
...

2449
01:57:24,570 --> 01:57:25,050
Easy.

2450
01:57:26,290 --> 01:57:27,110
Easy, easy, easy.

2451
01:57:29,830 --> 01:57:30,230
Yes.

2452
01:57:31,570 --> 01:57:32,090
Plants vs.

2453
01:57:32,190 --> 01:57:32,690
Zombies map.

2454
01:57:32,810 --> 01:57:33,390
I know, right?

2455
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:35,830
You guys, the Tuturu is a lie.

2456
01:57:38,610 --> 01:57:40,350
I don't know where that lie came from.

2457
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:42,110
Like, I don't know where that rumor started.

2458
01:57:43,150 --> 01:57:44,050
It's so weird.

2459
01:57:44,970 --> 01:57:45,370
But...

2460
01:57:46,970 --> 01:57:47,510
You know.

2461
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:49,410
It's so weird.

2462
01:57:50,370 --> 01:57:52,130
How that started and...

2463
01:57:52,630 --> 01:57:53,970
Oh my god, we're losing lives.

2464
01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:55,790
For me?

2465
01:57:59,470 --> 01:58:00,290
For me?

2466
01:58:01,670 --> 01:58:02,550
For me?

2467
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:03,850
Oh, I can't put the plane here.

2468
01:58:04,030 --> 01:58:04,670
What can I put here?

2469
01:58:05,470 --> 01:58:06,330
Little dart monkey.

2470
01:58:07,830 --> 01:58:08,710
For me?

2471
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:16,260
How dare you?

2472
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:19,180
How dare you say that?

2473
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:26,040
I missed the Tuturu lie.

2474
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:26,800
It couldn't have been you.

2475
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:27,660
Yeah, it wasn't me.

2476
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:31,340
It was not me.

2477
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:34,680
I can tell you that with full confidence.

2478
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:36,520
I can tell you that with full confidence.

2479
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:38,780
Oh my gosh, I can even put monkeys out here?

2480
01:58:39,260 --> 01:58:39,300
Oh my gosh, I can even put monkeys out here?

2481
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:40,000
What?

2482
01:58:41,220 --> 01:58:42,300
That's crazy.

2483
01:58:43,140 --> 01:58:43,740
Wait.

2484
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:46,300
The monkeys can go anywhere.

2485
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:47,540
Look, he's outside of bounds.

2486
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:48,260
Wait.

2487
01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:52,200
Warrior monkey.

2488
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:54,100
Warrior monkey.

2489
01:58:58,700 --> 01:59:00,340
Rolling for mint noise.

2490
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:01,740
Rolling for mint noise.

2491
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:10,210
Nice monkey.

2492
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:11,310
Why aren't you doing anything?

2493
01:59:12,070 --> 01:59:12,790
Handle it.

2494
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:17,570
Uh oh.

2495
01:59:22,250 --> 01:59:23,810
I instinctually said...

2496
01:59:26,430 --> 01:59:26,970
Hello chat.

2497
01:59:28,690 --> 01:59:29,630
He's watching.

2498
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:30,450
Yeah, he is.

2499
01:59:30,490 --> 01:59:31,050
He's watching.

2500
01:59:31,110 --> 01:59:31,630
He's judging.

2501
01:59:39,950 --> 01:59:40,510
He's watching.

2502
01:59:40,510 --> 01:59:40,510
He's judging.

2503
01:59:41,490 --> 01:59:42,010
Let's see.

2504
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:45,730
That's crazy.

2505
01:59:45,850 --> 01:59:47,950
I can't put one on top of the fence.

2506
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:48,650
Which kind of sucks.

2507
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:51,290
I could just have a monkey out here.

2508
01:59:51,510 --> 01:59:51,870
Yep.

2509
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:56,740
Let's see.

2510
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:00,560
Maybe ninja monkey would be good at the end.

2511
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:01,420
That guy is fast.

2512
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:03,420
Can I do more than one on here?

2513
02:00:03,700 --> 02:00:04,320
Well, I don't know.

2514
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:07,900
Hey, ninja monkey.

2515
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:08,740
You're supposed to be fast.

2516
02:00:08,740 --> 02:00:09,720
We're losing lives.

2517
02:00:15,210 --> 02:00:17,270
You're supposed to be fast.

2518
02:00:21,980 --> 02:00:23,360
The ice monkey in mint.

2519
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:24,080
He did nothing wrong.

2520
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:26,720
He brought coleslaw to the barbecue.

2521
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:32,220
He brought coleslaw to the barbecue.

2522
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:37,100
Oh my god.

2523
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:37,760
Ninja monkey.

2524
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:39,280
Ninja monkey.

2525
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:40,860
What is wrong with you?

2526
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:48,960
We're gonna die at this rate.

2527
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:50,180
Whoa.

2528
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:53,980
There's so many.

2529
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,280
Potato salad is much better.

2530
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:56,780
Exactly.

2531
02:00:58,060 --> 02:00:59,400
I'm hearing my name.

2532
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:00,640
Are you a slaw?

2533
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:04,020
Did you just dox yourself?

2534
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:05,660
First name Cole, last name slaw.

2535
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:08,720
Nice.

2536
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:10,000
Nice.

2537
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:14,860
Is that bad?

2538
02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:17,260
I'm familiar with barbecue etiquette.

2539
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:19,020
At a minto barbecue.

2540
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:19,140
BBQ.

2541
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:20,440
No slaw!

2542
02:01:20,660 --> 02:01:21,180
No slaw!

2543
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:21,920
No slaw!

2544
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:23,540
No coleslaw!

2545
02:01:23,820 --> 02:01:24,420
No coleslaw!

2546
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:28,740
Oh, you're making me want chicken salad.

2547
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:31,580
Try making a custom map with chat sometime.

2548
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:33,020
The map editor is pretty goofy.

2549
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:35,740
I have to... Here, let's see.

2550
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:38,100
I'm just gonna... We'll get through these rounds.

2551
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:39,900
We'll see if we make it to round 40.

2552
02:01:40,980 --> 02:01:42,240
And then, um...

2553
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:43,900
I think, what?

2554
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:46,400
I think it's 6,000 monkey bucks?

2555
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:49,860
I will pay for more monkey bucks if I have to.

2556
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:53,520
Kimchi coleslaw?

2557
02:01:53,680 --> 02:01:54,180
I'll be honest.

2558
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:56,560
I don't think I've ever had kimchi before.

2559
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:58,420
Because it's always spite.

2560
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:02,120
It's always spicy.

2561
02:02:02,860 --> 02:02:03,700
He's doing it!

2562
02:02:04,460 --> 02:02:05,700
Oh my god, he's doing it!

2563
02:02:07,680 --> 02:02:09,300
Having a ninja monkey was so great!

2564
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:16,670
Oh, come on, ninja monkey.

2565
02:02:16,710 --> 02:02:18,230
Why did you let that guy slip past you?

2566
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:24,780
Yes.

2567
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:28,580
I think we're gonna make it.

2568
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:31,120
Oh, I have so much money.

2569
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:32,100
Why am I not upgrading?

2570
02:02:33,020 --> 02:02:35,200
I have so much money.

2571
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:41,160
Donating to Mint's legal defense for the Tuturu case.

2572
02:02:41,740 --> 02:02:43,140
Thank you.

2573
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:44,740
Thank you, Xenophobe.

2574
02:02:44,820 --> 02:02:45,220
Thank you.

2575
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:47,040
I appreciate it.

2576
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:48,480
Nice.

2577
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:49,940
He's faster.

2578
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:50,440
He's stronger.

2579
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:53,780
Nice.

2580
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:53,780
He's faster.

2581
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:53,780
He's stronger.

2582
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:53,820
He's faster.

2583
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:53,820
He's stronger.

2584
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:55,280
Wait, this one we're going with the top.

2585
02:03:09,020 --> 02:03:10,540
I'm surprised he got all of those.

2586
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:15,280
Okay, nice.

2587
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:17,420
Nice!

2588
02:03:20,380 --> 02:03:22,540
Oh, we got this in the bag, everybody.

2589
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:24,680
We got this in the bag!

2590
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:27,200
Doesn't have to be spicy.

2591
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:31,380
I had some soggy kimchi from a jar and it was okay.

2592
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:32,360
Maybe worth trying again.

2593
02:03:32,820 --> 02:03:34,640
Maybe it's supposed to be soggy from a jar.

2594
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:36,280
I don't know.

2595
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:41,480
Being in a custom map doesn't give you any monkey money.

2596
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:46,020
Because you could just make the longest map possible and Trivial clear any game mode for...

2597
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:47,320
Oh, I guess that's fair.

2598
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:48,060
Here we go.

2599
02:03:48,120 --> 02:03:48,400
Here we go.

2600
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:51,900
Yippee!

2601
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:57,500
We did it.

2602
02:03:57,500 --> 02:03:58,360
Easy peasy.

2603
02:03:58,700 --> 02:03:59,800
Lemon squeezy.

2604
02:04:02,940 --> 02:04:04,860
Let's go see how much it is and how much I got.

2605
02:04:05,380 --> 02:04:05,940
Oh, wait.

2606
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,660
I have almost 5,000 monkey bucks.

2607
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:12,800
And it is 6,000.

2608
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:18,420
Or it's 7 dollars.

2609
02:04:19,740 --> 02:04:21,860
If I buy more...

2610
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:26,080
I would need 2,000 more.

2611
02:04:27,700 --> 02:04:31,380
I could just do the 5,000 one, I guess.

2612
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:43,590
Not worth.

2613
02:04:48,630 --> 02:04:53,010
50 dollars for 50,000 mountain of monkey money.

2614
02:04:53,670 --> 02:04:54,510
That's insane.

2615
02:04:55,750 --> 02:05:00,530
You'll need a team of monkey Sherpas to reach the summit of this awesome mountain of monkey money.

2616
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:02,130
Why does it have a description?

2617
02:05:04,570 --> 02:05:04,990
Why

2618
02:05:09,140 --> 02:05:10,280
does it have a description?

2619
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:14,700
Go for the sale?

2620
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:15,880
I'm not going to lie.

2621
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:16,960
I was kind of looking at the sale.

2622
02:05:20,870 --> 02:05:21,650
Don't do it.

2623
02:05:22,450 --> 02:05:22,870
But...

2624
02:05:22,870 --> 02:05:25,010
But I want to make our own maps.

2625
02:05:26,350 --> 02:05:28,430
You guys, I want us to create a map together.

2626
02:05:31,210 --> 02:05:33,670
We can make a Metal Gear map.

2627
02:05:34,670 --> 02:05:35,710
Those don't exist.

2628
02:05:35,850 --> 02:05:36,670
I've looked them up already.

2629
02:05:47,620 --> 02:05:48,600
Monkey money funds.

2630
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:50,500
No, Garlimauld, don't do it, please.

2631
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:52,560
Don't give me any, please.

2632
02:05:54,940 --> 02:05:56,040
Not for monkey.

2633
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,880
No, not for monkey.

2634
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:08,700
It's only 12 dollars.

2635
02:06:18,250 --> 02:06:19,610
They're a cool dev team.

2636
02:06:20,710 --> 02:06:22,430
Yeah, they give us a lot of stuff.

2637
02:06:22,910 --> 02:06:23,430
I guess.

2638
02:06:23,690 --> 02:06:24,310
I don't know.

2639
02:06:26,530 --> 02:06:28,990
Shadow Moses map or Groznygrad map?

2640
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:32,610
Granini gra... Granini gra... Granini...

2641
02:06:33,190 --> 02:06:34,430
Granini Gorge map.

2642
02:06:39,210 --> 02:06:39,690
Monkey...

2643
02:06:39,690 --> 02:06:41,050
No, I don't know.

2644
02:06:41,990 --> 02:06:43,630
How much did the base game cost?

2645
02:06:43,810 --> 02:06:45,990
I think it was 7 dollars.

2646
02:06:46,810 --> 02:06:48,870
I don't remember how much it was when I bought it.

2647
02:06:48,870 --> 02:06:50,390
Embrace your inner monkey.

2648
02:06:50,570 --> 02:06:51,830
Is it 12 dollar tax right now?

2649
02:06:51,910 --> 02:06:52,730
No, you guys.

2650
02:06:53,470 --> 02:06:57,010
Here's some money so you can make a weapon that surpasses monkey gear.

2651
02:07:02,470 --> 02:07:05,030
Usually... okay, this is my thought process.

2652
02:07:06,270 --> 02:07:08,090
This is my thought process with games.

2653
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:12,230
When a game... well, this one isn't free to play.

2654
02:07:12,410 --> 02:07:16,710
But I usually have this kind of mentality with, like, gacha games.

2655
02:07:16,970 --> 02:07:20,250
Like, for example, like, I'm Blue Archive.

2656
02:07:20,250 --> 02:07:21,290
I'm Sensei.

2657
02:07:21,990 --> 02:07:26,310
So, if a game is free to play, you know?

2658
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:28,030
Like, if it's a gacha game.

2659
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:31,030
But I... and I enjoy it so much.

2660
02:07:32,190 --> 02:07:35,930
I'll, like, throw, like, 5 bucks a month at it, you know?

2661
02:07:36,210 --> 02:07:40,530
Because I'm like, you know, it's providing me entertainment and fun.

2662
02:07:41,250 --> 02:07:43,130
And so I'm just like...

2663
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:45,270
I want it to continue.

2664
02:07:46,570 --> 02:07:48,510
So I get when people are like...

2665
02:07:48,510 --> 02:07:51,070
Oh, I don't spend any money on gacha games.

2666
02:07:51,470 --> 02:07:52,710
But I'm just like...

2667
02:07:52,710 --> 02:07:54,210
But I want it to keep going.

2668
02:07:54,810 --> 02:07:55,670
High roller.

2669
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:56,690
I know, right?

2670
02:07:57,330 --> 02:07:59,830
I spend how much I feel the game is worth to me.

2671
02:08:01,450 --> 02:08:02,590
It's how they get you.

2672
02:08:02,810 --> 02:08:04,810
Yeah, but I, like, I do it in moderation.

2673
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:07,250
Now, that's on you.

2674
02:08:07,850 --> 02:08:12,290
That's on you if you can... if you get caught in that spider web.

2675
02:08:12,730 --> 02:08:13,570
That's on you.

2676
02:08:15,090 --> 02:08:17,250
You are providing me entertainment and fun.

2677
02:08:17,310 --> 02:08:18,290
And I want you to continue.

2678
02:08:20,370 --> 02:08:21,630
Oh my god, Teacup!

2679
02:08:22,910 --> 02:08:24,270
Am I gonna see you again today?

2680
02:08:26,190 --> 02:08:27,310
You guys, I saw...

2681
02:08:27,310 --> 02:08:27,690
I saw...

2682
02:08:27,690 --> 02:08:28,670
I met people yesterday.

2683
02:08:28,830 --> 02:08:29,210
It was so fun.

2684
02:08:35,070 --> 02:08:36,470
Wailing is a skill issue.

2685
02:08:36,690 --> 02:08:37,290
So true.

2686
02:08:39,510 --> 02:08:41,710
But also, Blue Archive is, like, so generous.

2687
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:46,210
I've already gotten the two unique girls from the free temples.

2688
02:08:47,890 --> 02:08:49,330
But I need Iroha.

2689
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:00,520
Dress Hina next week?

2690
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,140
Fight to prove that your will is weak.

2691
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:14,380
Wait, let's see.

2692
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:16,280
How much was Bloons on here?

2693
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:17,100
Let's see.

2694
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:17,900
Store page.

2695
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:19,600
Bloons?

2696
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:20,500
No, no, no.

2697
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:22,200
Bloons is...

2698
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:24,680
$14?

2699
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:27,680
What?

2700
02:09:31,900 --> 02:09:32,380
$14?

2701
02:09:32,860 --> 02:09:33,340
$14?

2702
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:33,540
$14?

2703
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:35,880
$14?

2704
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:38,480
I will not be buying the monkey money.

2705
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:43,040
No way.

2706
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:48,160
Okay, I spent $14 on your game and you're gonna make me pay for more monkey money?

2707
02:10:05,850 --> 02:10:07,450
Increase the price due to the updates.

2708
02:10:08,610 --> 02:10:10,690
I was gonna say, I did not spend that much on it.

2709
02:10:11,250 --> 02:10:12,710
Minakari, thanks for the 10 gifted.

2710
02:10:15,570 --> 02:10:17,010
That's crazy, though.

2711
02:10:17,630 --> 02:10:19,990
I mean, they do give you a good amount of cash.

2712
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:22,150
Like, I haven't...

2713
02:10:22,150 --> 02:10:23,950
I haven't spent anything...

2714
02:10:23,950 --> 02:10:25,930
Or rather, I haven't bought any.

2715
02:10:26,070 --> 02:10:28,730
And I spent it on Sada and her skin.

2716
02:10:30,330 --> 02:10:31,170
So, you know.

2717
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:34,110
They do give you a lot of monkey money.

2718
02:10:34,470 --> 02:10:35,290
But dang.

2719
02:10:36,770 --> 02:10:37,070
Dang.

2720
02:10:49,950 --> 02:10:51,590
Wait, what?

2721
02:10:53,130 --> 02:10:54,090
Wait, what?

2722
02:10:57,430 --> 02:10:58,630
Hold on.

2723
02:12:40,470 --> 02:12:41,910
I'm so sorry about that.

2724
02:12:42,050 --> 02:12:43,610
Basically, I saw...

2725
02:12:43,610 --> 02:12:54,290
Okay, my phone, I think, did like a freaky AI, like, message thing to be like, This is what the phone call is about something something.

2726
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:55,070
I was like, huh?

2727
02:12:55,330 --> 02:12:58,750
Because I was saying that my cat had an ultrasound today.

2728
02:12:59,210 --> 02:13:00,270
I was like, no.

2729
02:13:01,110 --> 02:13:02,090
That's not possible.

2730
02:13:02,130 --> 02:13:06,350
But I actually do have to get going because my cat is out of his medicine.

2731
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:09,710
And I've been waiting a couple days for the vet to get back.

2732
02:13:09,710 --> 02:13:12,330
To me to refill it so I could go get it.

2733
02:13:13,610 --> 02:13:14,090
And...

2734
02:13:16,450 --> 02:13:17,370
Cat's freaky?

2735
02:13:17,590 --> 02:13:17,830
No.

2736
02:13:18,750 --> 02:13:19,670
He's a man.

2737
02:13:20,530 --> 02:13:22,270
I mean, he's got no balls.

2738
02:13:22,450 --> 02:13:22,970
But he's...

2739
02:13:22,970 --> 02:13:24,770
I've seen his pink thing, unfortunately.

2740
02:13:26,870 --> 02:13:27,350
Unfortunately.

2741
02:13:28,350 --> 02:13:29,310
But, yeah.

2742
02:13:29,470 --> 02:13:32,030
They close relatively soon.

2743
02:13:32,110 --> 02:13:33,470
So, I have to go and...

2744
02:13:33,470 --> 02:13:34,190
Sorry.

2745
02:13:34,330 --> 02:13:35,610
I was like, huh?

2746
02:13:35,930 --> 02:13:37,670
But I've been waiting for their phone call.

2747
02:13:37,930 --> 02:13:38,790
So, I...

2748
02:13:39,950 --> 02:13:40,390
Yeah.

2749
02:13:40,570 --> 02:13:41,790
Thanks for the stream, Mito.

2750
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:50,800
It's okay.

2751
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:53,680
I didn't intend on having a super duper long stream today.

2752
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:56,140
Because I was like, wow, I'm going to be doing meet and greets.

2753
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:58,240
Tomorrow, I won't have a stream either.

2754
02:13:58,360 --> 02:13:58,900
I'm really sorry.

2755
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:03,600
Because I will be at the convention all day.

2756
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:06,700
But Sunday, I will be continuing Metal Gear Solid 2.

2757
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:07,840
Probably.

2758
02:14:08,080 --> 02:14:09,840
Maybe I'll start sooner.

2759
02:14:09,940 --> 02:14:11,680
Maybe I'll aim to endurance it.

2760
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:14,200
Maybe.

2761
02:14:14,260 --> 02:14:14,460
Maybe.

2762
02:14:15,980 --> 02:14:16,920
Actually, I might do that.

2763
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:18,700
Thanks to the panel today and for the stream.

2764
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:19,560
Frankie!

2765
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:21,880
I can't believe you.

2766
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:24,520
I can't believe you wouldn't introduce who you were.

2767
02:14:24,820 --> 02:14:25,620
This guy.

2768
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:29,460
This guy comes up and is just like, yeah, I'm probably the oldest wisp here.

2769
02:14:29,580 --> 02:14:30,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2770
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:31,200
And I'm just like, wait.

2771
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:32,260
What's your name?

2772
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:34,800
And he's just like, I'm Memboo number two.

2773
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:35,600
And I...

2774
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:37,920
I saved all the Memboo cards.

2775
02:14:38,120 --> 02:14:41,040
But they were in a different folder than I thought.

2776
02:14:41,140 --> 02:14:42,920
So, I couldn't find it at the moment.

2777
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:43,000
So, I'm just like, wait.

2778
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,220
I have to go digging and then I was like, yeah.

2779
02:14:45,360 --> 02:14:45,800
Where is he?

2780
02:14:45,980 --> 02:14:46,240
You?

2781
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:47,860
Memboo number two?

2782
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:53,700
I'll never forget that.

2783
02:14:54,540 --> 02:14:55,900
I'll never forget that now.

2784
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:57,600
He made you work.

2785
02:14:57,740 --> 02:14:58,040
I know.

2786
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:00,360
He lied.

2787
02:15:00,580 --> 02:15:01,480
It was me, Minto.

2788
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:02,400
I'm the oldest.

2789
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:04,660
Who's Memboo number one?

2790
02:15:04,720 --> 02:15:05,340
That's Paige.

2791
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:09,720
Who's around here sometimes.

2792
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:12,540
But it was something.

2793
02:15:12,620 --> 02:15:12,980
It was Memboo number one.

2794
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,500
If you went to Off-Kite, you maybe met Paige.

2795
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:21,480
I remember.

2796
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:22,740
I remember.

2797
02:15:22,940 --> 02:15:23,400
I remember.

2798
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:26,040
I remember.

2799
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:26,760
I remember.

2800
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:27,200
I remember.

2801
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:30,180
I try to remember you guys.

2802
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:32,340
Even though I couldn't remember number two.

2803
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:38,480
Anyway, thank you guys for Bloonsin' with me.

2804
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:40,040
You know what?

2805
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:41,740
We're gonna try harder with the...

2806
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,260
With the Ice Monkey Challenge next time.

2807
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:46,700
We will...

2808
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:50,900
We will complete the Ice Monkey Challenge in some capacity.

2809
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:54,220
We will have it done.

2810
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:57,680
But I'm gonna take a break from Bloons for a while since I'm, you know...

2811
02:15:57,680 --> 02:15:59,080
Since I was like...

2812
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,200
I don't know.

2813
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:08,340
It's so weird because this is usually my comfy game but...

2814
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,340
I'm kinda Bloonsed out.

2815
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:11,860
Maybe that's why I'm Bloonsed out.

2816
02:16:11,900 --> 02:16:12,920
Because I've played it too much.

2817
02:16:14,600 --> 02:16:16,180
I bet there are some people cheering.

2818
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:16,800
They're just like...

2819
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:16,860
Yeah!

2820
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:17,800
No more Bloons!

2821
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:18,120
Yeah!

2822
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:23,740
This is what happens when I have no Minecraft, you guys.

2823
02:16:24,680 --> 02:16:25,060
Weedie!

2824
02:16:26,620 --> 02:16:27,440
Welcome to membership!

2825
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:27,880
Thank you!

2826
02:16:29,020 --> 02:16:30,240
Too much of a good thing?

2827
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:30,640
Maybe.

2828
02:16:32,700 --> 02:16:33,080
Terraria?

2829
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:33,840
That might be fine.

2830
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:41,020
Okay.

2831
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:42,520
I'm gonna go get my cat's medicine.

2832
02:16:42,520 --> 02:16:43,280
That was...

2833
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:46,340
I guess good timing-ish because I...

2834
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:48,160
Yeah.

2835
02:16:49,580 --> 02:16:50,120
Uh...

2836
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:50,820
Yeah.

2837
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:52,900
War Tortoise!

2838
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:53,460
Thanks for a buy!

2839
02:16:53,880 --> 02:16:54,800
Thank you, thank you.

2840
02:16:54,860 --> 02:16:55,740
Luigi Mansion.

2841
02:16:58,020 --> 02:16:58,560
Luigi...

2842
02:16:58,560 --> 02:16:59,860
Weegee Mansion.

2843
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:04,040
This is what no Minecraft does to a MF.

2844
02:17:04,140 --> 02:17:04,720
Mint Phantom.

2845
02:17:05,740 --> 02:17:07,520
Thank you guys for hanging out with me!

2846
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:09,100
And I will see you guys...

2847
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:10,580
Sunday!

2848
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:11,320
Sunday!

2849
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:11,700
Sunday!

2850
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:12,040
Sunday!

2851
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:12,260
Sunday!

2852
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:13,620
Metal Gear!

2853
02:17:13,820 --> 02:17:15,580
Probably alllll dayyyy!

2854
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:16,620
All day.

2855
02:17:16,700 --> 02:17:17,440
Metal Gear.

2856
02:17:17,560 --> 02:17:18,840
All day Metal Gear!

2857
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:20,440
All day.

2858
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:21,020
Metal...!

2859
02:17:22,490 --> 02:17:22,670
Oh!

2860
02:17:22,770 --> 02:17:23,350
But also.

2861
02:17:23,530 --> 02:17:26,050
If you do want some Minto action tomorrow...

2862
02:17:26,050 --> 02:17:29,030
The panel that Ayami and I will be...

2863
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:29,890
A part of.

2864
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:35,270
At Anime Fest Dallas will be streamed on Twitch, so you can see the both of us there as well.

2865
02:17:35,710 --> 02:17:38,490
We have a little funny... Fun panel...

2866
02:17:38,490 --> 02:17:42,270
That Ayami-sensei actually thought of, so...

2867
02:17:42,270 --> 02:17:42,750
Also!

2868
02:17:43,410 --> 02:17:44,850
Oh my gosh, I asked her.

2869
02:17:44,910 --> 02:17:56,210
We've been trying to do this for a while, but we wanted to have an off-collab, and now since I'm going to be in Japan for a long time, we're going to do it!

2870
02:17:56,290 --> 02:17:57,270
We're going to have an off-collab.

2871
02:17:57,410 --> 02:18:07,130
So if you guys have any suggestions on what kind of off-collab you would like for us to do, feel free to suggest that with me and Ayami-sensei.

2872
02:18:09,070 --> 02:18:09,790
Marriage stream!

2873
02:18:10,990 --> 02:18:13,370
Oh my gosh, what if we could go to a shooting range?

2874
02:18:16,270 --> 02:18:16,630
ASMR?

2875
02:18:23,850 --> 02:18:24,570
In Japan?

2876
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:26,430
Yeah, there are shooting ranges in Japan!

2877
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:31,190
I don't know how we would film that though, or how we would stream that though.

2878
02:18:33,890 --> 02:18:37,130
Maybe I can take a video of it.

2879
02:18:37,190 --> 02:18:38,570
Maybe we can go together and I'll make a video.

2880
02:18:38,590 --> 02:18:39,410
Take a video.

2881
02:18:40,010 --> 02:18:40,710
Or something.

2882
02:18:41,210 --> 02:18:43,050
My first ever shooting range too.

2883
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:51,960
We'll see.

2884
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:53,640
We'll see.

2885
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,020
Anyway, okay.

2886
02:18:55,440 --> 02:18:56,220
Thank you guys!

2887
02:18:56,360 --> 02:19:02,180
I'm going to try, since I'll be in Japan for a while too, I'm going to try and get lots of fun stuff filmed as well.

2888
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:08,900
Filmed, and I'll of course keep streaming.

2889
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:10,600
I have... actually.

2890
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:12,880
Actually.

2891
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:13,720
Because I will.

2892
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:18,180
I actually got a better hotel this time.

2893
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:24,420
But yeah, for real this time.

2894
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:25,100
For real this time.

2895
02:19:25,460 --> 02:19:26,820
And hopefully I won't get sick.

2896
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:28,280
Okie dokie!

2897
02:19:28,420 --> 02:19:29,200
Thank you guys.

2898
02:19:29,460 --> 02:19:30,600
I will see you guys later.

2899
02:19:30,940 --> 02:19:31,860
Have a good night!

2900
02:19:32,040 --> 02:19:37,300
If I see you at the convention, at Anime Fest in a couple hours with the...

2901
02:19:37,300 --> 02:19:38,500
With the...

2902
02:19:39,720 --> 02:19:42,620
A little meet and greet.

2903
02:19:42,700 --> 02:19:43,500
I'll see you then!

2904
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:45,400
Otsumintou!

2905
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:45,840
Itterashiaimase!

2906
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:48,920
Otsumintou!

2907
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:49,680
Bye bye!

2908
02:19:49,860 --> 02:19:50,800
Thank you, thank you!

2909
02:19:51,480 --> 02:19:52,560
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2910
02:19:52,980 --> 02:19:53,660
Bye bye!

2911
02:19:56,500 --> 02:19:57,920
You can still hear me!

2912
