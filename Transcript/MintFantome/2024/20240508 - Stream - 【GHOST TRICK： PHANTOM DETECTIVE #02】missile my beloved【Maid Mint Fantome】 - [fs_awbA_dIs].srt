1
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,680
Okay, we're fine.

3
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,890
We're okay.

4
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,410
Welcome back, Master.

5
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,290
Master.

6
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,370
Hello.

7
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,820
Du.

8
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
Hi.

9
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,560
Hello.

10
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,820
I'm back.

11
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,940
Welcome back.

12
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,560
Welcome back.

13
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,260
Welcome back.

14
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
What's so funny?

15
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,680
I did this.

16
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,280
You hear it?

17
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,620
You like that?

18
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
You like the double audio?

19
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,560
Kinda sounds cool now, actually.

20
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,000
Wait, you guys don't hear the double audio?

21
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,970
Congrats on 200k.

22
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,130
Thank you.

23
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,890
Thank you, thank you.

24
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,070
No?

25
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,410
The whole time you've heard the single audio?

26
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:37,810
Oh.

27
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,110
That's so weird.

28
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,050
I don't hear a double.

29
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,610
Definitely double.

30
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,170
Yeah, it was double for a second.

31
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,250
Right at the start.

32
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,850
Okay, I feel like I'm going crazy.

33
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,590
You guys like the new emotes?

34
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,990
Excuse me, waiter.

35
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,890
This ghost is too tricky.

36
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,590
Excuse me, waiter.

37
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:58,590
This ghost is too tricky.

38
00:03:59,330 --> 00:03:59,830
Bustin'.

39
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,430
You like them?

40
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,750
They're so fun.

41
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,770
Thank you, Tuna.

42
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,730
Thank you, Wolfie.

43
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,890
For the new ones.

44
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,590
This is not all of them.

45
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,810
There will be more.

46
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,670
Sai, welcome to the membership.

47
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,450
Oh my gosh.

48
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:19,730
Wow.

49
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,770
Thank you for the gift.

50
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,050
Thank you so much.

51
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,950
Thank you.

52
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,110
Amy, thank you for the gift.

53
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,390
Thank you, guys.

54
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,050
Thank you.

55
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,590
Yeah.

56
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:32,910
More?

57
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,830
Yeah, I'm going to get more.

58
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,530
I have...

59
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,210
I don't remember how many more slots I have.

60
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,950
But I have more.

61
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,950
I have to get them commissioned.

62
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,710
Fun.

63
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,590
Thank you for the 10.

64
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,450
Thank you.

65
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,790
Thank you so much for the 10 gift.

66
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,610
Thank you so much.

67
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,810
All the slots for sure.

68
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,650
I think so.

69
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,430
I think so.

70
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,650
I don't know...

71
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,930
I don't remember how many it is exactly.

72
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:06,730
But...

73
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:10,770
Earlier...

74
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:19,210
Actually, just a half hour ago, I got off with finishing recording with Mataro the next podcast episode.

75
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,010
And we had talked for two hours before that.

76
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,630
So I'm a little sleepy.

77
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,110
Hi.

78
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,430
Welcome to membership.

79
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,270
Thank you.

80
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,670
You what?

81
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,850
I did the podcast.

82
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,430
Good morning.

83
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,550
And...

84
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,770
No, I don't want to do a short stream because I want to get through this.

85
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,590
I've been having fun playing it.

86
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,550
But...

87
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,190
And then before that, this morning, I had a meeting.

88
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,540
So...

89
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,980
It's been a busy day for me.

90
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,520
I've just been...

91
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,780
I've just been in my...

92
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,520
On my computer the whole time.

93
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,060
So...

94
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,200
Yeah.

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,040
But I'm excited to play Ghost Trick.

96
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,320
The reason I say all that is because if my voice...

97
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,800
If my...

98
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,840
If my voice starts to get weird, it's because I've been talking all day.

99
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,920
The number of stamps increased.

100
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,160
Yeah!

101
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,180
I got a new stamp.

102
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:36,780
Yeah.

103
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,480
What did you have a meeting about?

104
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,720
I can't say.

105
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,120
Oh my gosh, and yesterday I went to the doctor's office and I was so sad.

106
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,340
I hate going to the... It was... Nothing bad happened.

107
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,960
I hate going to the doctor's office.

108
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
So... Yeah.

109
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,160
Let's...

110
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,040
Wow, this doctor... Thank you!

111
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,100
Wait, hold on.

112
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,700
Did you see that Konami is bringing back the Metal Gear Solid Ducks?

113
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,240
Specifically Ocelot, Otacon, and Psycho Mantis.

114
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,680
Have fun tricking ghosts.

115
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,400
Thanks!

116
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,160
I did see that they posted about it.

117
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,040
Wait, so there's no more... No new Solid Snake?

118
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,240
I think I...

119
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,800
I think I want the Ocelot Duck, but I think I'm okay with the other ones.

120
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,080
Been waiting for this milestone chat since 2021!

121
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,320
Oh my gosh, thank you!

122
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,360
I only have Solid Snake.

123
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,920
I hope you are healthy.

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,700
I think I am.

125
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,500
What am I gonna do?

126
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,180
Die again?

127
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,320
Hahahaha!

128
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,600
Hahahaha!

129
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,600
Yeah.

130
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,100
But uh...

131
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,040
How do you do the...

132
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,160
How do you do the...

133
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,960
The emote with the little... with the... with the...

134
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,120
With the wind?

135
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,120
I wanted to do it with the clown.

136
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,800
Looks like he was passing a little gas.

137
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,880
4AM can't sleep, but gonna watch Pinto!

138
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,620
I hope that I can help you sleep a little bit more.

139
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,360
Oh, is it Dash?

140
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:25,680
Quack, sir.

141
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,900
Quack, sir.

142
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,040
Hahahaha!

143
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,520
Yeah, it's like the...

144
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,760
Hahahaha!

145
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,600
Fart Unleashed!

146
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,540
Oh my gosh!

147
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,580
Hahahaha!

148
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,060
Stop it, you guys!

149
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:43,720
Stop it!

150
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,100
Okay.

151
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,760
So last time on Ghost Trick, we...

152
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,960
Um...

153
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,380
We, uh...

154
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,260
Found out that we are dead.

155
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
And we...

156
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,120
We have special ghost powers where we can possess any inanimate thing.

157
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,020
We're trying to figure out who killed us.

158
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,960
We also have special powers where we can go back in time.

159
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,040
And save people from becoming dead, because we saved a dog and a lady.

160
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,180
What?

161
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,940
You're dead?

162
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,420
I'm dead!

163
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,060
I'm dead!

164
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,500
I'm dead!

165
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,880
Yeah, we saved Missile, the best dog ever.

166
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,540
We saved a lady.

167
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,560
We don't know her yet.

168
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,440
And there were some blue guys.

169
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,500
I love Missile.

170
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,720
I love Missile!

171
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,720
Dad?

172
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,100
Let's continue.

173
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,080
What's on the extras?

174
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,840
I think this is like all the background...

175
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,820
Wait, challenges.

176
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,760
Oh!

177
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,600
Oh, wait!

178
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,360
Cleared ghost trick.

179
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,020
75% of what?

180
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,520
I've already cleared 75% of something.

181
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,140
Mystery of a secret.

182
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,020
Wait, maybe I...

183
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,600
Don't look at that!

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,100
And we have illustrations.

185
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,340
Oh, look at that!

186
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,040
This is such a good wallpaper for...

187
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,720
Oh, I can zoom in and out.

188
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,620
For my streams.

189
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,020
Oh my gosh, this is the one I use for my streams.

190
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,440
Oh!

191
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,760
The Junkyard!

192
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,220
That's one of the guys.

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,820
Tippy Toes?

194
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,880
I don't remember his name.

195
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,400
There's a girl sick in this bed.

196
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,600
Lamp!

197
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,280
Nearsighted Jigo!

198
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,880
Down!

199
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,480
Thanks for the tiny gift and thank you!

200
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,580
Thank you so much!

201
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,620
Alright, let's get started though.

202
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,900
We started...

203
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:57,940
at...

204
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,560
Well, they're both the same.

205
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,460
Let's go!

206
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,900
Oh, someone else just died!

207
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,860
We have to save the girl again!

208
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,840
Don't we?

209
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,160
Well, I don't know.

210
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,700
What was her name?

211
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,680
Emily?

212
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:08,780
Emily?

213
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,720
Okay.

214
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,800
Oh gosh.

215
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,200
Okay.

216
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,820
We're tricking again.

217
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,660
We can swivel the desk.

218
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,040
Okay.

219
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,500
Now we're going ghost again.

220
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,160
And we're... Oh, we can examine the notebook?

221
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,100
What's up with this blinding pink notebook?

222
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,360
Lynn!

223
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:34,900
Lynn!

224
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,240
Lynn!

225
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,000
That was her shot.

226
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,700
Sorry.

227
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,620
Her name.

228
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,220
Her name was Lynn.

229
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,300
I read shot.

230
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,880
Somebody stuck it behind the bookcase at a haphazard angle.

231
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,440
Maybe that's the superintendent's way of tidying up.

232
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,460
Okay.

233
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,820
Her shot.

234
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,480
Sorry.

235
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,160
Oh, we can turn on the lamp.

236
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,960
We're showing them the notebook.

237
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,080
Notebook.

238
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,800
There's also the book up here that we can't get up to yet.

239
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,260
Motor.

240
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:12,800
Oh!

241
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,720
Ew!

242
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,280
What are these?

243
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,460
There's like a whole contraption down here.

244
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,600
Interesting.

245
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,180
Interesting.

246
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,580
Interesting.

247
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,500
Oh.

248
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,380
Wait.

249
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,280
Oh, there we go.

250
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,120
She's probably still sleepy.

251
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,640
Matryoshka.

252
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,240
Unconscious this time as well, eh?

253
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,400
How's the audio, by the way?

254
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:43,620
Oh!

255
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,420
She's awake!

256
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,520
Where...

257
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,780
am I?

258
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,920
Oh my god, she's awake!

259
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,280
She's awake!

260
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,240
She's coming too?

261
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,440
You're gonna extract him too?

262
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,220
What happened to me?

263
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,580
Audio's good?

264
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:01,920
Oh god.

265
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,700
Excuse me.

266
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,620
Are you ignoring me?

267
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,480
Oh, uh, sorry!

268
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,800
I'm still not used to talking with dead people, you see.

269
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,040
Dead?

270
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,000
It's in red.

271
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,740
So I'm dead, huh?

272
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,820
Hmm.

273
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,380
Try as I might, I can't seem to remember who I am.

274
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,040
She's starting to remind me of me.

275
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,760
Who am I?

276
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,960
Everybody seems to call you Lin, if that's any help.

277
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,160
Lin, huh?

278
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,300
Pretty cute name.

279
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,760
And apparently you're a detective too.

280
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,420
Detective?

281
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,300
You mean that super cool kind of cop that solves crimes and upholds justice?

282
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,500
Sounds like a pretty subjective description, but yes, that kind of detective, quote-unquote.

283
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,760
I love that this game has two buttons.

284
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,820
Ghost and trick.

285
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,280
Um, wait a minute.

286
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,880
Um, actually, are you starting to remember something?

287
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,260
Oh my god!

288
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,340
Mike Tyson's ass!

289
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,640
Thanks for the five kete!

290
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,520
Thank you!

291
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,260
We umi neko now.

292
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,140
Oh.

293
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,720
Is my chair okay?

294
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,560
There's no time to lose!

295
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,970
Something really unusual is going down in this town tonight.

296
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,010
What?

297
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,710
What?

298
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,010
Remak thanks for the five kete!

299
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,930
Yeah, I certainly won't argue with the really unusual part.

300
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,210
This song is so fun!

301
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,170
That's not your face, you know.

302
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,230
Take another look.

303
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,490
You're the dead one.

304
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,570
Oh, right, of course.

305
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,270
It'd be pretty heinous if I looked like this, I guess, wouldn't it?

306
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,150
I don't know if heinous is the right word.

307
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,370
I just took things for the five kete dude!

308
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,930
There we go!

309
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,390
Now this is more like it!

310
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,030
She was just...

311
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,250
She was actually stealing that guy's identity.

312
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,480
Something really unusual is going on in this town tonight.

313
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,640
Could it have anything to do with my death, I wonder?

314
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,950
This is my 7am alarm.

315
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,350
You wake up to this?

316
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,610
Oh gosh, this is triggering for you then, probably.

317
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,690
Identity theft is not a joke.

318
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,550
Sorry.

319
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,850
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

320
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,370
I'm just gonna put my...

321
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:51,470
You remember that guy that put his social security on, like, a truck and drove it around New York?

322
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,910
And then said, No one will steal my identity.

323
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,490
It's protected by this company!

324
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,430
And then it all got stolen.

325
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,030
Hahahaha Hahahaha

326
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:12,310
Hahahaha Hahahaha Don't ever tell people... Don't ever challenge people, you know?

327
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,340
What is going on in this town tonight?

328
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,080
Don't ask me.

329
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,420
I'm dead.

330
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,700
I don't remember anything.

331
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,500
I can't remember a thing.

332
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,260
I think it's probably cause I'm dead.

333
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,060
Grr... Everything is so confusing!

334
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,680
Can't you do something?

335
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,560
Oh wait...

336
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:40,420
If he protects her, or brings her back, will she be able to remember who we are, just like Missile?

337
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:40,940
The dog?

338
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,860
Hey, you're asking the wrong guy!

339
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,060
Same for you, Mint?

340
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,580
What do you mean?

341
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,040
That I have no memories?

342
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,280
Or don't challenge me?

343
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,580
Hahaha But I've got some things to ask you about.

344
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,140
Oh!

345
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,740
She's not gonna remember me though.

346
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,480
What about her death?

347
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,020
So I died, huh?

348
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,840
Yes, apparently.

349
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,920
I'm very sorry.

350
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,700
How could this have happened?

351
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,400
After I just passed my test, finally...

352
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,480
Wait, she remembers!

353
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,680
My exciting career of catching the bad guys has just begun!

354
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,660
And now look at me!

355
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,200
Why did I have to go and die?

356
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,880
In an old junkyard like this?

357
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Poor Shock...

358
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,540
Oh wait, poor Shock...

359
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,000
Hahaha Poor kid!

360
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,940
The shock is setting in!

361
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,880
Poor Shock...

362
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,440
And so I told her everything that happened tonight.

363
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,080
About ghost tricks, possessing and manipulating objects.

364
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,120
And about going back four minutes before a person's death.

365
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,920
Poor Shock...

366
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,180
This actually isn't the first time you died tonight, you know?

367
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,800
That's so freaky!

368
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,080
Oh my gosh, can you imagine?

369
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,620
You were already shot and killed once before tonight!

370
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,680
And you saved me?

371
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,080
That's right!

372
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,980
You don't remember?

373
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,040
Flashback!

374
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,960
Oh, death!

375
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:15,880
Slip...

376
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,040
Let's get rid of the funky music.

377
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,580
Death isn't that funny, you guys.

378
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,500
Yes, I think I do remember something like that happening.

379
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,620
Vaguely.

380
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,400
Yes, I did get shot!

381
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,220
By a blue man dressed in all black!

382
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,200
How does she remember that?

383
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,820
I guess that means that even if a death is erased, the memory of it remains.

384
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:40,780
Eww!

385
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,300
Oh my gosh, she can remember how it hurt and everything?

386
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,120
The pain...

387
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,880
So I died twice already tonight.

388
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,440
You are so unlucky.

389
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,100
Is Mint literate?

390
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,660
Wish I knew what to say to her.

391
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,020
Guess I'll just have to wait until she recovers a little.

392
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,800
Hey, I bet that's some kind of a record, don't you think?

393
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:09,940
Hey, I bet that's some kind of a record, don't you think?

394
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,100
Yeah, you're probably right.

395
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,420
Looks like she's pretty much recovered already.

396
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,980
About me.

397
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,980
Do you remember anything about me?

398
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,820
Looking for the answers to the questions, Who am I?

399
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,920
And why was I killed?

400
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,440
Do you know anything that might help me?

401
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,440
Do you know anything that might help me?

402
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,020
She can't read chat.

403
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,060
I'm sorry.

404
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,700
I'm sorry.

405
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:37,780
Sorry.

406
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,520
I'm also gonna be yawning tonight.

407
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,100
The only thing I know right now is that my name is Sissel.

408
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,060
Your name is Sissel, huh?

409
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,300
I think so.

410
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,920
It rings some kind of a bell anyway.

411
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,980
I think I was killed tonight while I was meeting with you.

412
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,740
So you must at least know me.

413
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:54,940
I think.

414
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,600
I was meeting with you?

415
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,020
Yes, in the junkyard outside.

416
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,840
I'm EP.

417
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,340
I have a...

418
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:06,940
Sorry.

419
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,560
I'm sorry if I'm so grumpy.

420
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,440
I don't think I'll be grumpy.

421
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,320
But...

422
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,320
I haven't been able to sleep much the past couple of nights because of the...

423
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,020
What's the word?

424
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,660
The pinched nerve in my neck keeps me up.

425
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,600
So I'm sorry if I'm grumpy.

426
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,500
Grumpy.

427
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,400
I'm grumpy.

428
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:30,500
Grumpy.

429
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,100
Mint's illiterate.

430
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,820
She can read the fine print on solid snakes.

431
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,540
But...

432
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,860
It's not fine print.

433
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,460
I mean, that's...

434
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,580
That's not what's fine about it.

435
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,820
But yeah.

436
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,540
I'm sorry.

437
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,420
I'm trying to sleep.

438
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,140
But I can't.

439
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,640
Because I'm...

440
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,460
I don't know.

441
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,740
I don't know, I just twist and turn, and it's all pain.

442
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,700
Anyway, it's coming back to me.

443
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,820
I remember now.

444
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,300
I knew it.

445
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,780
I knew you were the lead I needed.

446
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,880
But I'm so sorry.

447
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,720
I don't think I can help you.

448
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,100
She says with a smile.

449
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,320
Why not?

450
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
Because I don't know you.

451
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,340
What do you mean?

452
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,000
I thought you said you remembered me.

453
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,860
She only saw us dead.

454
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,580
I knew it.

455
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,280
She said I remembered something.

456
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,820
I remember the fact that I don't...

457
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:30,880
Oh.

458
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,140
I don't know you.

459
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,720
No way.

460
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,660
Two strangers.

461
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,320
So you don't know me, huh?

462
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,240
Nope.

463
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,000
Wish I did.

464
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,560
So do you suppose we're just two strangers who...

465
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,040
happened to meet tonight?

466
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,640
No way.

467
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,160
I don't think it was any accident.

468
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,460
Our lead, man.

469
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,660
Why in the world would I be way out here in the middle of nowhere for no reason?

470
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,900
I was asked to come here tonight.

471
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,080
Asked to come?

472
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,240
By who?

473
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,220
Your yawn is making me yawn.

474
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,840
I'm sorry!

475
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,760
If I have to get some coffee later, I will.

476
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,160
If I have to... I'm having tea right now, but if I have to have coffee, that's okay too.

477
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,920
Can't you kind of guess where this is going?

478
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,680
We were set up.

479
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,420
Oh, you're kidding me?

480
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,100
Bingo.

481
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:30,920
By you.

482
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,700
Oh.

483
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,380
I asked you to come here?

484
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,780
But why?

485
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,400
Oh.

486
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,300
That's not what I was getting at.

487
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,160
Oh my god.

488
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,200
Good thing she's the detective.

489
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,820
That's why I was going to ask you.

490
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,560
Oh, that's what I was going to ask you.

491
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,160
Why did you ask me to come here tonight?

492
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,960
Way out here in the middle of nowhere.

493
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,280
Oh my god, a love confession.

494
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,280
You gotta be kidding me.

495
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,740
It goes without saying that I don't remember.

496
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,160
Everything is so confusing.

497
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,500
Can't you do something?

498
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,660
Lin, I'm not saying you owe me or anything, but I have a favor to ask.

499
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,080
What is it?

500
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,080
In the next four minutes...

501
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,460
I didn't make a sound.

502
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,600
In the next four minutes, you'll probably come back to life.

503
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,520
When you do, do you think you could try to find...

504
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,920
Wait, do you think you could try to find out about me before tomorrow morning?

505
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,580
Yeah, I'm sleepy.

506
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,020
Who I am and why I was killed.

507
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Do you guys know a way to stop yawning?

508
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,280
Like legitimately.

509
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:47,080
I used to have a job where I would wake up at like 4 a.m.

510
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,900
and I was teaching English.

511
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,820
And I would like have to... like I would be on...

512
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,820
Oh, I'm so sorry.

513
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,280
Anonymous, thanks for the vibe gift.

514
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,060
Thank you.

515
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,240
I would like... I don't think you can.

516
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:02,560
Right?

517
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,180
I don't think so.

518
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,680
I... either.

519
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,720
I almost dropped my controller.

520
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,860
But I... I would be so tired in the morning.

521
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,160
And then they would like...

522
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,080
They would...

523
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,600
They would... they would... they would...

524
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,880
They would say... they would get on my classroom and they would tell me to stop yawning.

525
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,480
Or I would like pause my screen so that they wouldn't see that I was yawning.

526
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,280
And they'd be like, stop pausing your screen.

527
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,620
And I was like, I'm yawning.

528
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,600
And they're like, no.

529
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,380
It's... it's... it's... rude.

530
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,660
Don't yawn.

531
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,780
I was like, I'm sorry.

532
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,560
Take deeper breaths.

533
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,880
Won't that make you sleepy though?

534
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,030
I know that they don't want me to yawn so that other people won't yawn.

535
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,250
How am I supposed to stop myself to yawn?

536
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:58,800
Man.

537
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,740
Man.

538
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,240
I still yawn.

539
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,200
I'm really sorry.

540
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,080
But I can't make any promises.

541
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,900
Might as well tell you to stop sneezing.

542
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,120
Right?

543
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,800
Why not?

544
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,820
Are the people I taught okay?

545
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,980
Who knows?

546
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,260
Why not?

547
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,460
I don't remember very clearly right now.

548
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,900
But I think I was investigating a case tonight.

549
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,580
A case that is very, very important to me.

550
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,920
So even if I come back to life...

551
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,100
I don't think I'll have time to find out anything about you.

552
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,460
You could do it in the middle of the night.

553
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,000
I know that's a terrible thing to say to the person who saved my life once already.

554
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,300
Apparently cold drinks and cold snacks.

555
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,100
I have a warm drink.

556
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,780
I'm messing it up.

557
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,620
I'm really, really sorry.

558
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,420
I see.

559
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,940
That's too bad.

560
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,120
But I'm afraid I'm still going to ask you.

561
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,720
Ask me what?

562
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,960
Ask you to save me.

563
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,300
Even though I probably won't be able to help you.

564
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,240
I know it's selfish of me.

565
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,380
I really apologize.

566
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,840
But I just can't die.

567
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,300
Not yet.

568
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,880
Not like this.

569
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,040
It's alright, Mint.

570
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,900
Don't worry about it.

571
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,720
Thanks.

572
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,240
I'm investigating something important tonight.

573
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,340
I think maybe that might be the reason I was killed.

574
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,540
But I still want to survive.

575
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,220
I want to solve that case in spite of all of that.

576
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,180
Am I out of line?

577
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,860
Didn't I tell you a minute ago you don't owe me?

578
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:46,300
I'm certainly not going to treat your life like some kind of bargaining chip.

579
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,440
I'll save you.

580
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,420
What you do after that is up to you.

581
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,520
He's so awesome.

582
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,440
He's so cool.

583
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,540
Thank you.

584
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,300
Are you ready to go back?

585
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,780
Back to four minutes before you got shot?

586
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,800
Yeah, rewind time.

587
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,140
Okay.

588
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,760
Four minutes before death.

589
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,740
We gotta see what's going on.

590
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,460
Okay.

591
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,740
Lin's second death.

592
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,740
I'm heading back in time now to rewind.

593
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,480
Rewrite her fate.

594
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,780
Faced with those circumstances, she could have just lied and promised to help me.

595
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
But she didn't.

596
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,940
That's when I knew I could try.

597
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,320
Trust her.

598
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,740
So much sleepy.

599
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,540
After this, I'm going to get coffee.

600
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,180
Don't worry.

601
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,600
Okay, here we go.

602
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,320
We're watching her.

603
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:41,960
She's on the phone.

604
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,040
I have a bad feeling about this.

605
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,800
Yes!

606
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,920
Is this the guy that shot her?

607
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,720
Detective!

608
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,920
Is everything okay?

609
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,860
I was hungry.

610
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,980
So I was trying to get something delivered.

611
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,240
What?

612
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,080
Don't do that!

613
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,780
I'm sorry.

614
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,140
You should leave jobs like that to me.

615
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,240
Is chicken alright?

616
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,720
He's so cute.

617
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:20,900
You...

618
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,580
One chicken dinner.

619
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,240
Winner winner.

620
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,360
What a nice guy.

621
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,500
That's okay.

622
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,420
I'm not feeling very hungry anymore.

623
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,000
Where was he going to order from?

624
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,880
I would like to go back to the station for a minute though.

625
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,220
You would?

626
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,860
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

627
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,520
I wish Mint would teach me English.

628
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,740
What do you want to learn?

629
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,400
What do you want to know?

630
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,840
Minty, do you know about the new auto-generated chat summary that YouTube implemented?

631
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,640
Seeing it pop up in your stream is decently accurate.

632
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,700
I have!

633
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,680
Wait, if we keep saying chicken, will it start saying like...

634
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,600
The chat is talking about chicken dinner.

635
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,620
That they'll be winners for eating it.

636
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,480
I never see them.

637
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,740
I never see the...

638
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,180
I only see the ones that people screenshot and then post on Twitter later.

639
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,360
But I don't see it myself.

640
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,500
Winner winner, chicken dinner.

641
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,060
Chicken dinner, chicken dinner, chicken dinner, chicken dinner.

642
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,240
It might be mobile only.

643
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,600
I think so.

644
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,260
Did someone say chicken?

645
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,260
Why can't you let me go back to the station?

646
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,760
Inspector Cabanela is on his way.

647
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,920
He'll be here any minute.

648
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,600
Oh, there he is.

649
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,180
Wow!

650
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,320
Evening, patrolman.

651
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,500
Sir.

652
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,960
Good evening, Inspector Cabanela, sir.

653
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,940
Chickens are the new melons.

654
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,900
Nice chickens.

655
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,180
Nice work.

656
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,780
Now, do me a favor and take a little patrol around outside, would you?

657
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,080
This guy killed me.

658
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,680
No way, but it came in through the window.

659
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,700
That's a nice fellow.

660
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,000
Yes, sir.

661
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,380
I love this little officer guy.

662
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,020
He's so cute.

663
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,010
Yo, how's it going, baby?

664
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,810
Inspector Cabanela, what are you doing here?

665
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,750
Imagine him with an Elvis...

666
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,010
I am doing Elvis voice.

667
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:42,750
This is not...

668
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,910
Is it not good?

669
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,690
Wait, I am doing an Elvis voice.

670
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,010
Is it not...

671
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,290
Is it not a good Elvis voice?

672
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,510
You hear it?

673
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,450
Six out of ten?

674
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,650
It's either Elvis or Johnny Bravo.

675
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,750
I thought the special...

676
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,750
Oh, oh, oh...

677
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,930
Daft Elf!

678
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,990
Thank you for the five gifts.

679
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,650
Thank you so much.

680
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,730
I thought the special investigation unit had an important...

681
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,550
top secret assignment tonight.

682
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,230
What does that matter at a time like this...

683
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,790
when my Lin's in chri...

684
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,710
My Lin?

685
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,660
My Lin's in crisis.

686
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,380
I appreciate it, sir.

687
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,480
Who are you?

688
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,360
Are you my...

689
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,560
Yeah, wait a minute.

690
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,660
Did you just say crisis?

691
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,000
Don't tell me I'm being suspected?

692
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,340
Uh-oh.

693
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,880
Suspected of shooting that pointy-haired man in the red suit?

694
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,580
I mean, I've never even met the guy before.

695
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,480
Hmm.

696
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,780
Never, baby.

697
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,840
Oh, well, uh...

698
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,340
Uh-oh.

699
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,980
Before tonight, I mean.

700
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,580
He asked me to meet him here.

701
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,800
Hmm.

702
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,640
Well, uh...

703
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,740
He said he had important information about the big case I'm working on.

704
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,040
He's the one who contacted me!

705
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,340
I see, I see.

706
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,100
But it's funny, isn't it?

707
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,340
I took a look at the list of cases your station is handling right now.

708
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,860
And I didn't see you listed as involved on any big cases.

709
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,440
We're rogue.

710
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,460
She's rogue.

711
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,100
You can't stop me, Dad.

712
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,520
You're not my dad.

713
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,020
You might be my dad.

714
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,640
But my dad wouldn't call me baby!

715
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,220
You know I don't suspect you, baby.

716
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,200
I'm just trying to clear things up.

717
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,760
Hubba hubba.

718
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,960
Wait, what is, uh...

719
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,760
What does Elvis say?

720
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,000
Humana, humana.

721
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:55,880
Wait, what?

722
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,760
Hoo-yah.

723
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:58,960
Uh, wait.

724
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,080
What is...

725
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,960
It just says baby?

726
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,820
Hubba hubba?

727
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,260
Oh, thank you.

728
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:11,500
Oh, thank you.

729
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,120
Thank you very much.

730
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,780
You're not the type to ever shoot anybody.

731
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,120
Hey, who knows you better than me, baby?

732
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,860
You know, if anything ever happened to you, I'd kill everyone in this room and then myself.

733
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,420
I'd never be able to look him in the eye again.

734
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,920
My dad?

735
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,580
Inspector Cabanela, I'm going to ask you a question.

736
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,740
Yeah?

737
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,780
And what's that?

738
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,840
Oh my god, she's going to get shot before she can ask.

739
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,800
And I want you to answer honestly.

740
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,600
Don't delay.

741
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,980
You're about to get hit!

742
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,340
Is it tonight?

743
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,820
Oh, is that when it's happening?

744
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,560
Honka honka!

745
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,260
I have no idea what you're talking about, baby.

746
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,400
Get down!

747
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:08,980
Oh...

748
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,320
That's that.

749
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,740
It seems to me that baby is indeed under suspicion.

750
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,280
By Inspector Cabanela?

751
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,420
No, he's not like that.

752
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,960
Just for the record.

753
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,600
Did you shoot me?

754
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:30,900
Me?

755
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,660
I would never do anything like that.

756
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,940
Anyway, it looks like the hitman fired from outside.

757
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,820
It'd be hard to prevent the bullet from coming in, though.

758
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,340
Hmm...

759
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,440
In any case, let's just give it a try.

760
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,920
Our four-minute game.

761
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,420
Our four-minute, twelve-hour game.

762
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,020
Hmm...

763
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,060
Trick time.

764
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,440
You know what?

765
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,360
I have an idea.

766
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,640
The guy who shot me is outside, right?

767
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,480
Looks that way, yeah?

768
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,420
Instead of trying to stop the bullet once it gets in here, wouldn't it be more fun to go out and stop the guy who's shooting the bullet?

769
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,680
I like it.

770
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,100
Fun, she says with eyes gleaming.

771
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:16,880
Oh boy.

772
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,740
You can use the telephone to move around, right?

773
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,880
That's right.

774
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,360
And I know the telephone number to the junkyard payphone, too.

775
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,880
But we're upstairs.

776
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,340
And the shot...

777
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:30,660
Meh.

778
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,740
I don't want to get shot again.

779
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,160
You know what they say.

780
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,500
About three strikes and you're out.

781
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,980
As long as you don't become a ball player, you'll probably be safe.

782
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,680
But the telephone thing's a good idea.

783
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,700
Maybe I'll give it a try.

784
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,180
What's she saying here?

785
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,340
I have a bad feeling about this.

786
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,400
Yes, sir.

787
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,940
I don't remember...

788
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,100
Wait.

789
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,520
Detective, is everything okay?

790
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,160
Oh, okay.

791
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,280
This is just to restart it.

792
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,600
My bad.

793
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,300
Let me turn ghost.

794
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,840
Let me turn ghost.

795
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,700
Turn ghost.

796
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,580
Ghost trick.

797
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,740
Oh, ghost.

798
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,040
Okay, let's see.

799
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,060
Where can we go to?

800
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,960
The motor.

801
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,320
Okay.

802
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,420
Step ladder.

803
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,120
Okay.

804
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,460
Let's see what this is.

805
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,220
Microscope.

806
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,880
Photos.

807
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,860
What's in the photos?

808
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,020
These pictures are old.

809
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,580
What are they of?

810
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,940
Little fragments of rock?

811
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,220
We're going ghost.

812
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,120
The fragments are glowing.

813
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,520
Do you know what these are?

814
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,280
It's nuclear.

815
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:50,900
Radioactive.

816
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:52,920
Radioactive.

817
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,520
Sorry, but I've lost my memory.

818
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,080
Probably not the best person to ask.

819
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,080
That's okay.

820
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,300
I was only being polite.

821
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,740
I didn't really think you'd know.

822
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,540
Ouch.

823
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,180
This lady's tongue can be sharp.

824
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,300
I can hear what you're...

825
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,700
She can hear what we're thinking?

826
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,500
I know.

827
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,100
Good one.

828
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,260
No way.

829
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,320
She can hear what we're thinking?

830
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,320
No.

831
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,530
That's so scary.

832
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,210
What could this be?

833
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,650
It looks like a giant nail clipper.

834
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,150
You think so?

835
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,250
Do you know what it is?

836
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,830
Why did you have to ask me?

837
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,910
Couldn't you see I was looking away evasively?

838
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:40,690
I'm sorry.

839
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:40,890
I'm sorry.

840
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,090
I'm sorry.

841
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:45,050
It's one of those science-y things that scientists use.

842
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,310
Ordinary people like us don't have to know what it is.

843
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,290
You're a detective.

844
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,210
You need to know everything.

845
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,990
I don't remember what science is.

846
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,090
Mom, where does science come from?

847
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,090
But it's apparently something Lin doesn't like very much.

848
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,030
She doesn't like or doesn't know?

849
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,210
Okay.

850
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,170
Do we know what's in the notebook?

851
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,170
Because this seems kind of important.

852
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:22,910
Oh, wait.

853
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,110
Oh, that's mine.

854
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:24,810
Isn't it adorable?

855
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,530
Cecil skipped first grade.

856
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,430
Why isn't your adorable notebook in your pocket?

857
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,510
I panicked, okay?

858
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,610
Don't you shove things in the bookcase when you panic?

859
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,630
Who are you calling anyway?

860
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,730
It was personal business.

861
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,110
I don't like the sound of that, Missy.

862
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,480
Oh, we still can't go through anything down here.

863
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,580
Oh, I was going to say, can I even get to the telephone?

864
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,500
All right, let's try dialing it.

865
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,260
Micmac, thanks for the five gifted.

866
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:04,740
Thank you.

867
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,200
Oh, that's funny.

868
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,000
What's the matter?

869
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,340
This telephone doesn't seem to be working right now.

870
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,260
Usually the telephone line glows red, but it's dark right now.

871
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,700
Oh, isn't it?

872
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,260
In the four minutes, we can't use it.

873
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,440
Apparently.

874
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,940
Yeah, in this four minutes before death, we can't use the phone lines.

875
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,800
Yes, yes, yes.

876
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,480
I remember now.

877
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,100
As long as the lines are closed like this, it looks like we can't go anywhere.

878
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,640
But I want to stop that criminal.

879
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,880
Where else can we go?

880
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,460
Notebook.

881
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,170
There's a lot of stuff going on down here.

882
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,270
Wait, I'm a little ball.

883
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,070
Can I move?

884
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:49,470
No.

885
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
We can't get that book either still.

886
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,140
What do you mean?

887
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,380
Let's see if I swivel it, if he does anything.

888
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,080
This guy is unfazed.

889
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,300
He's like, eh, I've seen worse.

890
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,220
I know.

891
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,720
This ain't my first poltergeist.

892
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,480
I don't have anything else over here, really.

893
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,600
So there's not really a reason.

894
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:23,780
I don't know.

895
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,440
I'm just gonna go over here.

896
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,160
Oh wait, I said I did it earlier though.

897
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,460
I wanted to turn the lamp on so that they would look at the notebook.

898
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,120
There.

899
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:36,580
Huh?

900
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,520
That's Lin's notebook.

901
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,900
Hey, wait a minute.

902
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,140
I did this earlier.

903
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,040
La la la.

904
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,260
La la la la.

905
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,140
I thought she was practicing a dance move when I came in.

906
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,420
Nope, that was definitely suspicious.

907
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,560
No question.

908
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,360
I'd better report this.

909
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,140
I wonder if I can make the call without her noticing.

910
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,880
You little snitch.

911
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,000
You little snitch.

912
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,240
Huh?

913
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:15,710
What's up?

914
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,010
I've been watching Lin just like you told me to.

915
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,250
And I noticed something suspicious.

916
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:22,670
Sus?

917
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,890
When the notebook is sus.

918
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,850
Hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi.

919
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,030
You did?

920
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,710
So Inspector Cabanilla was right.

921
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,390
She was hiding her notebook when I came in.

922
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,170
Her notebook, eh?

923
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,710
Yes, yes, sir.

924
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,930
In a very suspicious manner.

925
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,530
And in a very conspicuous place.

926
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,190
Just throwing all the memes out there.

927
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:02,270
Okay, but when you think of Among Us, do you not think of Five Nights at Freddy's 2?

928
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,230
Why would I?

929
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:26,950
I don't know.

930
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,150
What's the connection?

931
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,410
Okay, someone will be over later.

932
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:37,210
Don't let on you noticed anything.

933
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,390
Okay...

934
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:42,930
Look at that!

935
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,550
The phone line is glowing red!

936
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,290
I bet it would work if we tried it now.

937
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:52,590
I bet you're right.

938
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,630
The detective he's talking to is outside in the junkyard.

939
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,030
I mean FNAF also has vents.

940
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,330
So true!

941
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:03,310
So true.

942
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,300
And that's where the horrible hitman who's after me is too.

943
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,080
Are they?

944
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,140
I guess so.

945
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,200
Go to there.

946
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,660
The most ominous lamp I've ever... What?

947
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,320
The Notebook starring acclaimed actor Ryan Gosling?

948
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,620
He's not in that.

949
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,320
Is he?

950
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,660
I've been waiting for you.

951
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,740
Eek!

952
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,860
What are you?

953
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,820
A test clamp.

954
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,440
That sounds like an old grandpa.

955
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,340
Sounds like an old grandpa.

956
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,520
Just call me Ray.

957
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,600
Grandpa Ray.

958
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,440
You just have to get the grandpa part in there somewhere, don't you?

959
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,320
Well, we didn't have that context before.

960
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,240
Interesting.

961
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,880
We're souls.

962
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,860
We can choose any appearance we like.

963
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,840
Which means you have no intention of showing us what you really look like, right?

964
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,600
Now then.

965
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,620
About that gunshot that took your life.

966
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,800
So Mint could also turn into a lamp?

967
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,940
I mean, I guess if I wanted to...

968
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:50,820
Why?

969
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,660
Do you want me to turn into a lamp?

970
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,460
Do you want me to turn into a lamp?

971
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,940
Like anamorphs into a lamp?

972
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,640
The Notebook with Ryan Gosling.

973
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,500
No, it's not!

974
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,680
I'm looking this up.

975
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,400
If it's really Ryan Gosling in the Notebook...

976
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,400
I'll eat my shoe.

977
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,750
No, no, no, no, no.

978
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,370
No, no, no, no, no.

979
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:23,850
It's

980
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:37,270
not Ryan Gosling!

981
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:38,670
Oh my god.

982
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:43,770
No way!

983
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,550
Wait, who is Nicholas Sparks then?

984
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:49,810
Wait.

985
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,050
I don't know.

986
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,730
That shoe tastes good.

987
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:59,630
Don't use the cloud emoji!

988
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,330
No way!

989
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,610
The author of the book the movie is based on.

990
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,080
No!

991
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,460
No way!

992
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,240
I thought you guys were kidding.

993
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,340
I thought you were kidding because of the Ryan Gosling meme.

994
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,540
But he doesn't have a beard!

995
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,280
Time for lunch.

996
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,300
Okay, I'll eat it.

997
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,220
I'll eat it at the end of stream, okay?

998
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,960
Let me get through the stream first.

999
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,920
I heard your shoes taste just like tree frogs.

1000
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,580
Stop the cloud emoji.

1001
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,780
I heard it.

1002
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,140
Way up on the upper level.

1003
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,400
A scant few minutes from now.

1004
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,180
The hitman is probably getting his rifle ready right now.

1005
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,820
Alright, I'm going in.

1006
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,400
I'll get in with those ghost trick thingies.

1007
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,800
I'm very sorry, young lady.

1008
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,900
But how does it taste?

1009
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:19,460
No!

1010
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:19,560
No!

1011
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,140
That's okay, man.

1012
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,500
Surely Ryan Gosling isn't his real name.

1013
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,060
You don't have those powers.

1014
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,440
No, sir.

1015
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:37,860
What?

1016
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,260
Why not?

1017
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,660
I'm afraid I don't know the reason.

1018
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:44,260
But only a special few have the powers of the dead.

1019
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,520
What?

1020
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,140
Are you saying I'm not special?

1021
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,620
That's not fair.

1022
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,320
I got a trophy for participating in a game when I was a kid.

1023
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,540
I'm special.

1024
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,080
Anyway, we don't have much time.

1025
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,610
Come on and hop in.

1026
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,930
Ooh, he's greeting us to enter his body.

1027
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:11,130
There he goes.

1028
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,250
He's gonna go upstairs.

1029
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:13,930
Carry on, boys.

1030
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,410
Fate changed.

1031
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:20,890
Um...

1032
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,120
Okay.

1033
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,920
We're going crazy.

1034
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,440
If I fold this here, can we go up?

1035
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,860
Ooh, nice.

1036
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:39,380
Nice.

1037
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,520
Oh, it's this part again.

1038
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:44,880
Refrigerator.

1039
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,580
Oh, there's nothing.

1040
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,560
Nothing here.

1041
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,620
There's nothing.

1042
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,160
Your shoes are chocolate though, right?

1043
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,160
Yeah.

1044
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,100
Yeah.

1045
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,140
Thought bubble above?

1046
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,920
It's okay, I don't want... I don't want the hints.

1047
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,520
I don't want the hints.

1048
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,260
Oh there he goes!

1049
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,400
Oh my gosh, he's on the stairs!

1050
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,580
It's so crazy.

1051
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,300
But we gotta hop inside the lamp.

1052
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:11,800
Ray.

1053
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:13,860
Trick.

1054
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,320
Trick.

1055
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:14,740
Oh.

1056
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,960
What do you mean by hop in then?

1057
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,500
What do you mean by that?

1058
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,660
Let's see, what other things can we perform tricks on?

1059
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,120
We can ghost trick...

1060
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,300
me.

1061
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:39,710
Maybe we do this part again.

1062
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,640
Ooh!

1063
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,340
Time is passing!

1064
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:49,860
Oh wait.

1065
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,180
This needs to be on, right?

1066
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,440
Oh my god!

1067
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,360
Oh that was close.

1068
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,260
Whee!

1069
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,060
Why are you taking the bike?

1070
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:08,520
Uh...

1071
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,240
No, no, no!

1072
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,940
Okay, we saw him take the bike.

1073
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,640
There he goes!

1074
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,420
We should get going ourselves.

1075
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,560
Feels like we lost, you know?

1076
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,040
If there's one thing I hate, it's losing a race.

1077
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,800
I wasn't aware we were in a race with the inspector.

1078
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,020
Think barber pull stripes.

1079
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,760
You're red and he's white.

1080
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,060
And it's a race to the top.

1081
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,540
Maybe I should just indulge her and try again.

1082
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:35,700
Okay.

1083
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,340
Yeah, let's try this again.

1084
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:43,510
Oh!

1085
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:44,690
I cleared...

1086
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:46,370
I cleared a song?

1087
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:48,390
Wait, what's going on?

1088
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:54,470
Okay.

1089
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:58,590
Okay, there we go.

1090
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:02,650
Turn...

1091
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:04,730
on.

1092
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:07,610
Uh...

1093
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,790
There's nothing else we can do here.

1094
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,130
Maybe we were supposed to turn it on?

1095
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,510
Or turn it off?

1096
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,490
When he was up here.

1097
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:19,230
Mmm...

1098
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:22,770
Fun's for a good barbecue sauce to go with the leathery taste of...

1099
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,590
Thanks.

1100
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,290
Yeah, I think we missed the bike.

1101
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,360
Oh, but we see who's the guy!

1102
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,420
Oh my gosh.

1103
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,200
We see the guy though!

1104
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,420
Look, there he is!

1105
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:39,980
Way up there!

1106
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,360
The horrible hitman!

1107
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,500
I think his name is actually Tengu, but I guess that doesn't matter.

1108
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,480
Let's go grind him to pieces!

1109
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,660
I wish he wouldn't use such violent expressions.

1110
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,840
Besides, I don't see any cores that will get us over there.

1111
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,120
I think we might have missed our chance already.

1112
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,560
Timing is everything.

1113
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:00,100
Okay.

1114
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,220
Okay, sir.

1115
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:03,960
Okay,

1116
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,300
let's do it after the fate change.

1117
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:11,880
Okay.

1118
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,960
He's always one step ahead.

1119
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,520
I know!

1120
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,320
That's okay.

1121
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,720
We know that she's gonna die.

1122
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,740
We know how to get up there.

1123
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,700
And fold!

1124
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,340
Squidward!

1125
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:28,420
Tortellini!

1126
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,420
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1127
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,100
Thank you!

1128
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,240
Alright.

1129
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,800
I'm just gonna...

1130
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,140
What is this?

1131
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:38,920
What did they say anyway?

1132
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,880
That horrible hitman that's after me is upstairs, isn't he?

1133
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:42,940
Apparently.

1134
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,620
In other words, we can't stop him if we stay down here.

1135
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:45,860
See?

1136
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,120
I didn't need the hint, you guys!

1137
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,400
I was going...

1138
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,840
I was already on my way up there!

1139
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,480
I was already on my way up there.

1140
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,840
Now, we wait.

1141
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,960
It's time to hunt down that horrible hitman.

1142
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,080
He must be around here somewhere preparing to take his shot.

1143
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:14,740
Once...

1144
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,060
Step ahead, Minto!

1145
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,480
Let's try to find him fast.

1146
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,580
I'm going to make...

1147
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,840
I'm going to make good and sure he understands what happens to people who point guns at others.

1148
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,720
There's a gleam.

1149
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,240
So!

1150
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,020
What if maybe...

1151
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,040
The spotlight highlights him, maybe?

1152
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,510
That's what we might have to do.

1153
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:48,890
Time is passing.

1154
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:51,450
He might, like, kick it.

1155
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:52,530
If he gets so scared.

1156
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,820
What did I do wrong?

1157
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,140
Okay.

1158
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,740
I'm going ghost!

1159
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,160
What did I do wrong?

1160
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,780
There's nothing else we can do.

1161
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:52,660
There's nothing else we can do.

1162
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,020
What if I roll the tire?

1163
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,400
What if I roll the tire?

1164
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,140
Might have been a dumb idea.

1165
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,340
Okay.

1166
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:03,700
Yeah.

1167
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:04,540
There's nothing over here.

1168
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,180
Okay.

1169
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,220
Can he jump to his bike?

1170
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:08,740
Can he jump to his bike?

1171
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,230
What are you...

1172
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,810
Oh my gosh.

1173
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:15,890
He's dancing his way.

1174
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:16,730
Oh my gosh.

1175
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:17,590
Go!

1176
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:18,070
Go!

1177
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:18,330
Go!

1178
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:22,770
Oh my gosh.

1179
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:22,770
He's dancing his way.

1180
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,280
I thought that I was going to startle him...

1181
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,280
I thought that I was going to startle him...

1182
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:29,800
with the light.

1183
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,220
You guys...

1184
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,660
It's... I just...

1185
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,140
Oh yeah.

1186
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,100
Because I see now the bike is lit up.

1187
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:38,880
Oh yeah.

1188
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:39,740
Because I see now the bike is lit up.

1189
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:39,780
Guys!

1190
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,900
I had a good idea.

1191
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:42,200
Guys!

1192
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:42,200
I had a good idea.

1193
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:42,240
Okay.

1194
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,260
Here he comes.

1195
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:44,720
Here he comes.

1196
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,360
Nice!

1197
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,220
I'm going ghost.

1198
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,280
There he is.

1199
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,500
Spotlight him.

1200
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,320
Spotlight him!

1201
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,160
I see my target.

1202
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,440
Time to go to work.

1203
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:13,180
I'll be head of the Hitman division by next month now for sure.

1204
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,620
There he is!

1205
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,660
The horrible Hitman!

1206
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,240
We said this before.

1207
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,520
We have to stop him from shooting.

1208
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:21,940
Fast!

1209
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:26,730
Oh!

1210
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:28,330
Open!

1211
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:29,470
Oh!

1212
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,480
Time is passing!

1213
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,060
Turn the spotlight on!

1214
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:38,460
Yeah!

1215
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:39,740
Bozo!

1216
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,180
We put a stop to that shot at least.

1217
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,340
I'm so...

1218
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,380
I'm safe now, right?

1219
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,080
Well that changed your fate a little but it didn't avert it completely.

1220
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,280
We're not done yet.

1221
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:57,300
The Hitman is a professional and he really, really wants to be head of the division apparently.

1222
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,320
Now get blinded Bozo.

1223
00:56:59,320 --> 00:56:59,940
This guy.

1224
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,560
This stupid guy behind us.

1225
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,680
I vouched for you.

1226
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:07,620
I vouched for you but you can't even notice a Hitman coming from behind the car.

1227
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,720
I doubt blocking a shot here and there is really going to stop him.

1228
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,280
We have to kill him.

1229
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,500
We have to splat him.

1230
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,900
Just like the last guy.

1231
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,980
If you want to rough him up a little bit I promise I won't put it in my report.

1232
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:25,780
You made that bet knowing well that ghosts don't wear shoes.

1233
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,780
What?

1234
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:29,950
No.

1235
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:35,490
No.

1236
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:37,450
That was my...

1237
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,170
Oh she's so...

1238
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,680
Stop it.

1239
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:42,610
Stop it.

1240
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:46,090
Stop it.

1241
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:47,290
Stop it.

1242
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,670
Stop it.

1243
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:48,930
Stop it.

1244
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:50,930
Stop it.

1245
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,610
Stop it.

1246
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,580
Okay.

1247
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,660
I was going to say something else.

1248
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,200
But I don't want to go to the bathroom just yet.

1249
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,060
Let's think of something else before he gets us shot in.

1250
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,080
Fate has been changed.

1251
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:15,920
We're gonna pedal to the metal with this guy.

1252
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,600
Pedal, pedal, pedal.

1253
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,740
Oh we're stuck here.

1254
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,720
Just kidding.

1255
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,100
We're gonna bicycle.

1256
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,780
Close the door.

1257
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,420
Oh.

1258
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:33,940
Come here.

1259
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:34,360
Come here.

1260
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:34,640
Come here.

1261
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,640
Come here, nightstick.

1262
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,800
There we go.

1263
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,120
There we go.

1264
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:41,380
There we go.

1265
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,220
We gotta get the next spotlight.

1266
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:43,840
Oh my gosh.

1267
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,760
Don't you notice him?

1268
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:45,540
Sorry.

1269
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,500
Oh my god.

1270
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,860
This guy is so oblivious.

1271
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,240
Your hat is too low on your face.

1272
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,600
You can't see anything in front of you.

1273
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:54,980
Oh my god.

1274
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:04,150
If I want that position, I have to be careful of even the least bit of light.

1275
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,090
Division head is my ambition for this year.

1276
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:13,350
Next year, my motto will be If I want to be director, I have to be careful of even the least bit of scandal.

1277
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:17,970
So it sounds like he won't show up in spots where a light is on.

1278
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:23,130
And next year, I'm going to spread some nasty scandalous rumors about him.

1279
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:26,950
Wee woo.

1280
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:27,550
Wee woo.

1281
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:28,810
Flashing light!

1282
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:32,790
What?

1283
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:33,930
Wait, I didn't see him.

1284
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,390
Hey, did you turn that flashing light on?

1285
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:40,450
Wasn't me.

1286
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:42,170
It went off all by itself.

1287
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:43,510
Scared the heck out of me.

1288
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,630
Well, just make sure you lay off it.

1289
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,170
Don't want to waste any electricity.

1290
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:49,270
Wow, they're so...

1291
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:50,250
They're so conscious.

1292
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:53,130
Have things gotten that tight?

1293
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:54,330
That's pretty sad.

1294
00:59:55,890 --> 01:00:00,110
They're really putting the squeeze on us lately about using too much power at sites.

1295
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:04,430
They won't even let us use all of our searchlights at once.

1296
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:06,930
Interesting.

1297
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:08,210
Oh boy.

1298
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:10,770
We ought to be free to do at least that much.

1299
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,470
Especially on a dark night like tonight.

1300
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:13,570
Uh oh.

1301
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:21,670
I think I need to follow this guy now.

1302
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:29,110
Time is passing.

1303
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:31,770
Maybe I was wrong.

1304
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:33,850
Oh!

1305
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:35,930
Oh my gosh.

1306
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:46,540
Budget cuts.

1307
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,840
What are you gonna do exactly?

1308
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,280
Hey, I told you.

1309
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,600
I think if we...

1310
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:58,060
If we make it so we can't do the shot from here, it'll at least keep the spotlight on on the other location, you know?

1311
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:03,320
So, he won't be able to go back to the other car, but he also won't be able to get it here.

1312
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,060
That's what I think.

1313
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,380
I told you to lay off that thing.

1314
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,220
And I told you, it wasn't me!

1315
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:12,760
Uh oh.

1316
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,640
I think I might know what's going on here.

1317
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,300
This is the work of...

1318
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:19,840
You know.

1319
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:21,580
Hey!

1320
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,100
Shut up!

1321
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,640
You're creeping me out!

1322
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:30,880
But you know as well as I do, the only explanation for mischief like this is...

1323
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,860
I'm not gonna get caught here, am I?

1324
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:35,980
Inspector Cabanela!

1325
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:39,600
So they tell tales about him as though he's a ghost, eh?

1326
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,500
Inspector Cabanela is really a very nice person.

1327
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,900
G-g-g-ghost!

1328
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,820
Oh, jinkies!

1329
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:53,980
Wait, so if I just stay here...

1330
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:03,090
It doesn't feel like I'm doing so much.

1331
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,500
You're allegedly a ghost.

1332
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:14,520
What's the best trick?

1333
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:15,760
Um...

1334
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,460
I don't know.

1335
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:18,600
What if I do this?

1336
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,040
Nothing happens.

1337
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:23,420
That's funny.

1338
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,760
I thought this lever was for swinging the crane arm around.

1339
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:31,000
I'd like to swing that horrible hitman around.

1340
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,640
This crane.

1341
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,920
I wonder if there's some other way we can use it.

1342
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:37,600
Oh wait.

1343
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:38,260
Uh...

1344
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:38,720
My bad.

1345
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,960
Can we reach the light?

1346
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:43,580
We can.

1347
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,080
But if I do this...

1348
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:55,050
I would have to go back with the other guy to get back up to the crane.

1349
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:59,070
But then that one turns off.

1350
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:00,910
Okay, wait, I think I messed up.

1351
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:03,470
One of the lights went out.

1352
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:05,590
There are three lights here altogether.

1353
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:07,870
Apparently we can't have all three of them on at once.

1354
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:10,630
Our station is crazy cheap when it comes to electricity.

1355
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:15,070
So just another detective could see what he was doing the other day.

1356
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:18,630
I had to pedal my bicycle in place to work the headlamp.

1357
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:19,030
Oh my god.

1358
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,210
Very sad tale indeed.

1359
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:23,490
Sounds like they're taking things way too far.

1360
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:25,550
Okay.

1361
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,610
So I'm gonna turn this one off.

1362
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:31,650
I need to get...

1363
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:32,330
Wait, come back!

1364
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:32,850
Uh oh.

1365
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:33,390
Uh oh.

1366
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:34,790
Wait, come back officer!

1367
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:36,350
Oh my gosh, please.

1368
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:36,950
Please.

1369
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:39,210
Sir.

1370
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:42,750
Time is passing!

1371
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:44,810
Oh my god, I hear him!

1372
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:45,310
I hear him!

1373
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:45,730
I hear him!

1374
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,230
Oh my god, please.

1375
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,090
Oh my god.

1376
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:50,690
Okay.

1377
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:53,550
See,

1378
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:04,630
the bike I couldn't pedal.

1379
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,090
Can I pedal this one?

1380
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:09,530
No.

1381
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:14,430
Let's wait for our little guy here.

1382
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:15,690
Let's wait for our guy.

1383
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:20,070
Then we'll do it again at the other side.

1384
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:23,450
Then maybe try something with the...

1385
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:24,770
what the...

1386
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:28,210
Oh my god.

1387
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:35,870
Why?!

1388
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:36,970
Oh my gosh, why?

1389
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,570
Oh my god, I'm not gonna make it!

1390
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:44,030
No!

1391
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,120
Where is he gonna shoot her from?!

1392
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,360
Let's see.

1393
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,280
Raise here.

1394
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,080
Oh, neat.

1395
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:56,680
Okay.

1396
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,000
Lower?

1397
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,600
Oh, shoot!

1398
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,610
Such power and such speed.

1399
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:16,770
I bet that would put a nice stop to my horrible hitman.

1400
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:18,010
Okay, how do we move it?

1401
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,210
If it just stopped, then that would be fine.

1402
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:22,690
Phoenix, thanks for the membership!

1403
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:24,650
Welcome, welcome.

1404
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:27,250
If it killed him, would I be obliged to save him?

1405
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:30,950
Anyway, let's just focus on the stopping part.

1406
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:34,730
Apparently, thinking about things too deeply isn't something you like to do.

1407
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:36,970
Just the right amount.

1408
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:38,730
That's the way detectives think about things.

1409
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:40,570
How do I move this?

1410
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:44,210
Oh, I just love stamping out evil.

1411
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:45,570
It makes me feel so alive!

1412
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:47,990
Except for the fact that you can't.

1413
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:48,470
You're dead.

1414
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:54,150
Open.

1415
01:05:58,410 --> 01:05:58,850
What?

1416
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:04,930
Okay.

1417
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:09,390
Everybody, if I ask to open the umbrella, don't let me do it.

1418
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,310
Wait, did we see this before?

1419
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:20,730
Wait, I think we can pretty safely assume this was the murder weapon.

1420
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:23,290
Wait, I think we did.

1421
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:24,650
That pistol.

1422
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:28,550
Same model as the pistol you detected?

1423
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:29,550
Yeah, we saw this before.

1424
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:31,870
You don't think it's Lin, do you?

1425
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:33,190
This is not good.

1426
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,750
Blah blah blah, we've read all this.

1427
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:37,030
Oh, then we made it go off!

1428
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:37,530
That's right.

1429
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:41,910
It's a good recap.

1430
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:46,230
This is the act of somebody who is jealous of my abilities as a detective.

1431
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:48,230
Sorry if I'm not reading all of it, I'm just gonna...

1432
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:51,840
Oh!

1433
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:53,860
There it is.

1434
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:56,360
Her death.

1435
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:58,960
Time's up.

1436
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:00,740
Okay.

1437
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,160
Have to look for the right time.

1438
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:06,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1439
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,600
Oh no, we have to go all the way from...

1440
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,480
Oh my gosh.

1441
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,540
That's a long amount of time we have to...

1442
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:16,040
Oh, wait!

1443
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,520
Oh, okay, interesting.

1444
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:22,580
We can't do anything with the pedal.

1445
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,920
We only pedaled to get down here.

1446
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,900
How do I get up there?

1447
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:33,060
Also, see, I think the street lamp can be possessed?

1448
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:36,380
Hmm...

1449
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,120
Oh, look, my bad.

1450
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:39,940
Mister!

1451
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,780
Come back, please.

1452
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,180
Thank you, sir.

1453
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,260
What else can...

1454
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,480
Yeah, the lamp can also be...

1455
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:50,840
Hmm...

1456
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,620
La-la-la-la.

1457
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,340
La-la-la-la.

1458
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,660
La-la-la-la.

1459
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:13,890
But the lever didn't do anything.

1460
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,620
Follow this guy.

1461
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,160
I wonder if we do anything on the...

1462
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,540
The guitar is still all filled with bullet holes.

1463
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:33,160
That's so funny.

1464
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:38,410
Raise!

1465
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:42,250
Okay.

1466
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:48,110
And if I lowered it...

1467
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:49,610
It didn't really do anything.

1468
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:52,170
No.

1469
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:58,040
I'm just confused how to get over there.

1470
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,020
Oh no!

1471
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:00,640
Oh no!

1472
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,060
Oh no!

1473
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:01,860
Oh no!

1474
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:02,200
Wait!

1475
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:02,860
I can make it!

1476
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:03,280
I can make it!

1477
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,340
Oh, I can't make it!

1478
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:04,900
I can't!

1479
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:05,980
I can't make it!

1480
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,380
Oh no, he's gonna shoot her!

1481
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:08,780
Oh no, please!

1482
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:09,540
Don't shoot!

1483
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:10,220
Don't shoot!

1484
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:11,800
Oh no!

1485
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:12,040
Oh no!

1486
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:12,960
Come back, sir!

1487
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,880
Oh my god, he's loading his gun.

1488
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:36,980
This one!

1489
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,580
We need him to show up at this one!

1490
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,920
Wait, but this one...

1491
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,080
Okay.

1492
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,000
Uh...

1493
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,360
Oh, wait!

1494
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:53,120
Which one did it turn...

1495
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,640
Oh, no, yeah, because we already turned it off.

1496
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:54,940
Okay.

1497
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,100
Okay, now come back, please!

1498
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,120
Sir?

1499
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:01,620
Sir?

1500
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,300
Please come back.

1501
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,520
Thank you.

1502
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:05,860
Okay.

1503
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,020
Good thing we turned off that spotlight right there first.

1504
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:10,940
And then...

1505
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,400
Oh, that's where you show up, eh?

1506
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:16,640
Big dummy.

1507
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,100
This is quite a distance from the target.

1508
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,440
But I can't work under a spotlight after all.

1509
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,240
Never mind.

1510
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,600
A shot like this is nothing for a man of my skill.

1511
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:27,580
I mean, you're a sniper.

1512
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,640
That's what you're supposed to do, distance.

1513
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,740
Mr. Division Head seems to like dark, gloomy places.

1514
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:37,160
I'd be happy to throw him in a dark, gloomy cell.

1515
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,480
Or into dark, gloomy hell!

1516
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,960
When did I become her assistant?

1517
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,140
Wait, wait, wait!

1518
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:45,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1519
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:46,460
No!

1520
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,280
What?

1521
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:53,280
Whoa, they talked?

1522
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,300
No way!

1523
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,400
Okay.

1524
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,300
Time is passing.

1525
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:00,100
Okay.

1526
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,530
Just a little bit more.

1527
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:04,270
There we go.

1528
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:05,530
Okay.

1529
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:10,330
I'm going, ghost!

1530
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:13,890
It's over for you.

1531
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:15,490
Mister...

1532
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:18,570
Oh my god.

1533
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:25,230
Did you hear her scream just now?

1534
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:29,970
I'm telling you, it wasn't me!

1535
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:33,110
Oh my gosh, I killed two people tonight.

1536
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:34,450
Dang.

1537
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:41,360
I've killed two people just to save one girl!

1538
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,680
And a dog.

1539
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,880
I mean the dog was worth it.

1540
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,040
But what if the girl is evil?

1541
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:49,420
There.

1542
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:55,140
We found a nice dark spot for our gloom-loving hitman.

1543
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,700
I think your death has been erased.

1544
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:58,800
Again.

1545
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:01,580
Fate averted!

1546
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,220
Does Lynn seem evil?

1547
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,320
She's not.

1548
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:06,580
Maybe.

1549
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:07,500
I don't know.

1550
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:07,960
I can't...

1551
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:11,880
I don't know if I can trust her spiky hair.

1552
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:14,700
Why not?

1553
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:15,160
I wonder.

1554
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,300
Huh?

1555
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,780
Why don't I have powers like yours?

1556
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:25,640
If I could do things like you do, it could really help me pursue my case.

1557
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,520
Why only this special few, huh?

1558
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:30,620
It's not fair!

1559
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,280
That's the same thing the little doggy said, too.

1560
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:34,600
That's the same thing the little doggy said, too.

1561
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:35,300
That's the same thing the little doggy said, too.

1562
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,400
Well, I'm jealous of you, actually, because you get to stay alive.

1563
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,100
You are?

1564
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:40,440
Why?

1565
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,900
Because your life can be saved.

1566
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:47,040
Even if you die again tonight, I can save you with my ghost tricks.

1567
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,720
Nobody can save my life, though.

1568
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:51,060
Oh.

1569
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:52,960
Yeah.

1570
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,960
I'm dead, lady.

1571
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,620
You should appreciate your life.

1572
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:57,820
I'm dead.

1573
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,920
These powers of the dead.

1574
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,880
Why have they chosen me?

1575
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,280
Will I find the answer to that question?

1576
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:05,560
Tonight?

1577
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:06,880
I bet we will.

1578
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:09,420
Well, not in tonight's stream, maybe, but I don't know.

1579
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,040
Sissel, I'm so sorry.

1580
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:14,700
Well, you're free to do as you please now.

1581
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,040
I guess this is goodbye, detective.

1582
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,600
Will we ever see each other again?

1583
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,800
If you ever want to see me again, all you have to do is die.

1584
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:25,120
Okay.

1585
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:26,720
Got it.

1586
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,160
I was kidding.

1587
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,160
Well, guess we'd better be getting back to the present.

1588
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:38,680
Cool.

1589
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:42,360
Isn't that cool to say, die for me?

1590
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:49,300
Lynn is cute so she's worth saving.

1591
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:49,660
True.

1592
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,800
Lynn has escaped death for a second time.

1593
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,680
But that doesn't mean she's out of the water yet.

1594
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,720
I'd better go see how she's doing.

1595
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:00,720
Can you imagine?

1596
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,860
What if you just, like.

1597
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:05,280
What if you do the four minutes before death over and over again?

1598
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:25,400
That's just Steins Gate.

1599
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:29,200
That's called Steins Gate.

1600
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:32,440
But in this game...

1601
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,400
Oh my gosh, I love Steins Gate.

1602
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,720
I better go see how she's doing.

1603
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,320
I'm going ghost!

1604
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,300
Oh, whose bag is this?

1605
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,040
Mr. Officer, are you coming back?

1606
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,180
Wait, how am I gonna get over there?

1607
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,000
Check on how she's doing...

1608
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,340
Oh wait!

1609
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,400
I can check with the umbrella.

1610
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,000
That's why the umbrella is there.

1611
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,000
Through the phone.

1612
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:08,300
Yeah!

1613
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,780
I already thought of it before you.

1614
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,560
Was that light on before?

1615
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,150
Wait.

1616
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:23,390
Here.

1617
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:24,410
There.

1618
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:26,450
Oh, this way.

1619
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:31,130
Well...

1620
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:34,530
It looks like congratulations are in order.

1621
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:35,030
Oh, sorry.

1622
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:38,530
It looks like congratulations are in order.

1623
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:41,090
You erased yet another death.

1624
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:44,410
Well, aren't we so clever.

1625
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:46,730
I know.

1626
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,350
I know.

1627
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:55,670
But I haven't gotten any further in solving my own mystery, though.

1628
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:58,250
But that woman holds the key.

1629
01:15:58,550 --> 01:15:59,610
Don't forget that.

1630
01:16:00,710 --> 01:16:01,430
Lynn, huh?

1631
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:03,490
Now that she's alive again...

1632
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:08,050
She's probably still being detained in the Supers office.

1633
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:11,950
She won't be able to pursue her case without the freedom to move around.

1634
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:14,970
I'd better go back to the Supers office to see her.

1635
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:17,350
That sounds like a good idea.

1636
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:20,930
Beep boop.

1637
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:25,270
The Supers office.

1638
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:27,170
Actually, you guys, I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

1639
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:28,750
I said I was going to go earlier.

1640
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,610
But now I actually have to go.

1641
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:32,510
I have to go to the little ghosties room.

1642
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:34,550
Give me one minute.

1643
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:37,010
I'm also gonna get some more tea.

1644
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:37,970
Or coffee.

1645
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:39,390
One or the other.

1646
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,230
I'll be right back.

1647
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:48,290
You can enjoy this sick soundtrack while I get more drink.

1648
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:49,350
Okay, hold on.

1649
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:40,730
Oh my god.

1650
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:46,150
While I was getting my coffee, a package that I was waiting for came.

1651
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:46,890
Hold on.

1652
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:47,690
I'm gonna get some scissors.

1653
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:07,010
I was waiting for this because...

1654
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:07,530
Ah!

1655
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:08,610
Ah!

1656
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,110
I got...

1657
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:13,170
Stuff for my back.

1658
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:15,650
Ouch!

1659
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:17,190
I got...

1660
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:26,640
This is the thing for me to try later.

1661
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,600
For my neck.

1662
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:30,640
I got two things for my neck.

1663
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,480
But this one I lay on.

1664
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,280
This one's heavy because it's cat food.

1665
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:39,540
Hold on.

1666
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,200
I got...

1667
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,320
Yeah, stuff for my spine.

1668
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:47,120
Can't be.

1669
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:48,860
Oh.

1670
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:49,440
Wait.

1671
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:52,900
Yippee!

1672
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,800
Yippee!

1673
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,760
Okay, cat food!

1674
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,580
Thank goodness I was running out of cat food.

1675
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,200
Yeah!

1676
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:12,020
Stuff!

1677
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:15,800
I'm good.

1678
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:17,080
Oh my god.

1679
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:18,200
Lumbar support.

1680
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,000
I feel like such an old person.

1681
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:23,140
Oh.

1682
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:24,440
Okay, there we go.

1683
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:25,800
Umm...

1684
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,900
I'm gonna open it.

1685
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:27,780
I'm gonna put it on...

1686
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:27,920
Wait.

1687
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,480
Can I put it on right now?

1688
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,460
Will it be too difficult to put on?

1689
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:40,320
Also, I realized I didn't have any creamer either for my coffee.

1690
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,400
So, it's just coffee and...

1691
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:45,020
Milk.

1692
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:45,720
Oh, gosh.

1693
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:49,460
Grandma mint.

1694
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,160
It's just because I have a...

1695
01:22:54,300 --> 01:23:04,030
I always get pinched nerves in my arm... and in my... I have sciatica.

1696
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:10,770
That's a pinched nerve in your... in your... butt.

1697
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:13,750
So... I'm home!

1698
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:28,920
This product can cause burns.

1699
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,800
55 or older.

1700
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:33,540
Your risk of burning increases as you age.

1701
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:37,140
Do not wear while sleeping.

1702
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,700
Check skin frequently during use.

1703
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:41,900
Okay.

1704
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:46,140
Do not use for more than 8 hours.

1705
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,080
Okay.

1706
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:49,360
Actually that works perfect because...

1707
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,920
You will burn as you age.

1708
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:55,100
I'm in my 30s.

1709
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,980
I just bought an adjustable bed.

1710
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:59,480
Base for back pain.

1711
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:00,280
Embrace it.

1712
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,000
Let's go!

1713
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,580
Hey, there's nothing wrong with getting something for comfort, you know?

1714
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,140
And Draco thanks for the 10 gifted!

1715
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:08,240
Okay.

1716
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,220
How do I put this on?

1717
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:12,360
Uh...

1718
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:13,660
Heat cells.

1719
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:14,460
Okay.

1720
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:18,360
Guys, I'm gonna feel the deep penetrating relief.

1721
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:20,840
Wait, which way do I put it on?

1722
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,660
Oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.

1723
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,020
I think I get it.

1724
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,240
Okay, okay, okay.

1725
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,740
I'm gonna feel the deep penetrating relief that it says.

1726
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:35,500
Clinically proven to relax tight muscles and enhance flexibility and mobility.

1727
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,240
Why do I sound like such an old person?

1728
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,460
Oh my gosh.

1729
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,820
You don't have to say it like that.

1730
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:44,540
Okay, I gotta put it on...

1731
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,600
My neck.

1732
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:56,110
I don't feel anything yet.

1733
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:02,970
I'm so glad that this came.

1734
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:06,910
I need the relief.

1735
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:09,010
It's so much pain, you guys.

1736
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:13,210
Okay, I'm so sorry about that.

1737
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:13,570
Alright.

1738
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:15,370
Alright, we're good to go.

1739
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:17,030
Let's go to the super's office.

1740
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:21,190
The age of 3000 isn't a myth.

1741
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:23,050
Hag love!

1742
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:23,690
Woohoo!

1743
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,070
Deep penetrating relief.

1744
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:29,730
I decided to go back to the office where Lin was being detained.

1745
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:33,790
With her changed fate, her story was sure to change too.

1746
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:36,310
And maybe that would lead us in some new direction.

1747
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:38,530
Hags are love.

1748
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:39,110
Hags are life.

1749
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:40,370
This is the hag life, you guys.

1750
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:43,950
Have a great summer and also...

1751
01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:46,070
Have a... have a... healthy...

1752
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:47,770
Have a pain-free summer.

1753
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,870
With neck pain therapy.

1754
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:51,270
Deep penetrating relief.

1755
01:25:54,350 --> 01:25:54,830
Yeah.

1756
01:25:57,630 --> 01:26:00,210
Now that Lin is alive again, I wonder what she's doing.

1757
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:01,810
She said she was investigating...

1758
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:02,630
Oh my god.

1759
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:05,250
Investigating an important case tonight.

1760
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:07,470
Could that case be connected to me in any way?

1761
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:11,210
Hap... hap...

1762
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:14,370
Ghost hag arc begins.

1763
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:15,310
Oh!

1764
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:18,570
We cleared the challenge.

1765
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:22,070
I'm still so curious what's going on in that guy's basement though.

1766
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:24,070
Listen to the music.

1767
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:24,970
Yeah.

1768
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:28,850
Continue.

1769
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:29,230
Yeah.

1770
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:37,550
If you sleep on your side like I do, I had the same symptoms, tight muscles on the shoulder, neck with bonus tension headaches.

1771
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:39,830
Solved it all by sleeping with a pillow between the knees.

1772
01:26:39,930 --> 01:26:41,230
I can... I try.

1773
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:44,990
I seriously cannot sleep with a pillow between my knees.

1774
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:46,210
It drives me insane.

1775
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:48,550
I move around too much in my sleep, I think.

1776
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:50,310
I had one before.

1777
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:53,230
Hag life is either be warm forever or die.

1778
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:57,450
Also, I can't...

1779
01:26:57,450 --> 01:26:58,450
Um...

1780
01:26:59,470 --> 01:27:02,050
I... I... I'm such a particular sleeper.

1781
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,410
Oh my gosh.

1782
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:02,670
Okay.

1783
01:27:02,730 --> 01:27:03,570
So I...

1784
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:07,190
Can't have so much pressure on top of me.

1785
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:09,070
So like...

1786
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:10,570
When... um...

1787
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:11,230
When...

1788
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:14,070
When I have a pillow in between my knees...

1789
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:18,470
It makes it so that the sheets are too tight and it feels like it's...

1790
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:20,910
I'm not claustrophobic, but only...

1791
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:24,030
Only... only when I sleep do I feel claustrophobic.

1792
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:26,070
Because if I can't move around at...

1793
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:29,370
At will, then I feel like I'm gonna die.

1794
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:30,410
But...

1795
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:33,630
But, um...

1796
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:36,330
Dakimakuras exist for a reason.

1797
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:36,590
No!

1798
01:27:36,890 --> 01:27:38,130
I can't use a dak...

1799
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:39,570
I only look at dakimakura.

1800
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:41,350
I don't know.

1801
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:43,110
I'm so, so particular.

1802
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:50,490
But at the same time, I have to sleep with all of my arms and legs and everything underneath a big heavy comforter.

1803
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:55,330
Which makes no sense considering...

1804
01:27:56,910 --> 01:27:57,310
Considering...

1805
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:04,260
How did you sleep in Japan with their comforters?

1806
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:04,740
I was fine.

1807
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:08,420
It's so weird.

1808
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,260
I love my comforter.

1809
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:11,700
Me too!

1810
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,800
Oh my gosh, I felt so seen...

1811
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:14,500
Um...

1812
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,180
The other day.

1813
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,340
Because like, you know how comforters in like...

1814
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:21,480
When you see the pictures of them, they're so billowy and puffy and you're just like...

1815
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,300
Oh my gosh!

1816
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:25,580
This looks like the fluffiest ever comforter ever!

1817
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:27,860
And then when you get it, it's like...

1818
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:32,880
Flat and terrible and it feels like there's only five down feathers in it and you're like...

1819
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:33,700
What happened?

1820
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:34,760
I've been...

1821
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:36,040
I've been scammed!

1822
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:41,940
But I found out that there's like a thing that you have to get to make them look fluffy.

1823
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,960
I can't remember what it's called though.

1824
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:49,280
Hoodwinked!

1825
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:53,020
Hug your snake ducky when you get it.

1826
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:53,760
Oh, I am.

1827
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:55,320
I am.

1828
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:01,040
Duvet cover?

1829
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:02,560
It might be that.

1830
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:05,840
There was a different name too though.

1831
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,120
Anyway.

1832
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:12,120
When Lin lost her life for the second time, she was being detained on suspicion of my murder.

1833
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,400
But I saved her, hoping to solve my own mystery.

1834
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:19,140
Living creatures can choose to live their lives in one of two ways.

1835
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:23,600
They can either submit to their fate or they can try to change it.

1836
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,200
Lin is definitely in the second camp.

1837
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,320
Well, I mean...

1838
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,820
She's only trying to change it because you brought her back.

1839
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:33,760
It's you trying to change it.

1840
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:38,420
Just Google fluffing.

1841
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:39,580
Is that what it is?

1842
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:41,020
No, I don't think so.

1843
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:41,860
It's a different word.

1844
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:48,860
As soon as I got back to the junkyard superintendent's office, this fact was really brought home to me.

1845
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,360
What is fluffing?

1846
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,460
Do not Google that.

1847
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:53,240
Wait, what is that?

1848
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:55,400
Foo!

1849
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:56,440
You...

1850
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:58,540
We told you not to let the suspect out of...

1851
01:29:58,540 --> 01:29:59,400
What is fluffing?

1852
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:03,880
Not stream safe?

1853
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,080
I'm Googling it.

1854
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:11,560
Don't do it, apparently...

1855
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:12,180
No, Phil, no!

1856
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:16,820
Don't look, Minto.

1857
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,400
I'm not going to look it up because I'm scared.

1858
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:19,480
I'm actually...

1859
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,060
I have no idea.

1860
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,360
Preparation for a certain job.

1861
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:24,380
What?

1862
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:25,460
Fluffing?

1863
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:35,220
What kind of a job would have you prepare for something that would be called fluffing?

1864
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:38,100
Does it have to do anything with being fluffy?

1865
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:42,100
Like...

1866
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:51,240
Like, you know how some bigger people say I'm not fat and fluffy?

1867
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:55,520
No.

1868
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:56,440
Oh, okay.

1869
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:05,480
certain video actors.

1870
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,480
AB stuff.

1871
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:07,800
Really?

1872
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,240
What's related to AB?

1873
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:27,960
You fluff the relief...

1874
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,160
What does that mean?

1875
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,720
I'm confused...

1876
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:34,900
To keep you ready between shots.

1877
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:35,500
You fluff the relief?

1878
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:42,000
I just don't understand.

1879
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,760
Okay, I'm just going to believe you guys.

1880
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:47,480
I don't get it.

1881
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:51,360
Gotta raise the flag before you sit still.

1882
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:56,400
Oh, wait!

1883
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:00,900
I think I get it.

1884
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:06,450
Anyway...

1885
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:08,330
How do you know?

1886
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:09,870
How do you guys know that?

1887
01:32:11,570 --> 01:32:13,990
We told you not to let the suspect out of your sight.

1888
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:15,770
My apologies, sir.

1889
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:18,270
But I never thought she would run away.

1890
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:19,430
Oh my god, she just ran.

1891
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:20,190
She booked it.

1892
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:21,450
Lynn is our angel.

1893
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:22,730
I mean, her friend.

1894
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:26,130
I mean, she's like family to us.

1895
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:28,510
Angel, friend, or family.

1896
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:30,430
They all run when they have the chance.

1897
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:32,790
Because we're perverts.

1898
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:35,530
It's okay.

1899
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:36,750
I like that about you guys.

1900
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:37,830
A little bit.

1901
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:38,890
Okay.

1902
01:32:39,870 --> 01:32:42,930
Do you have any idea how many years it's been since my wife ran away?

1903
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:44,290
Holy moly!

1904
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:47,270
Feeny, are you okay?

1905
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:49,650
I'm very sorry.

1906
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:50,750
I have no idea, sir.

1907
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:55,390
You'll never make a detective at that rate.

1908
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:56,750
Dang.

1909
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,110
Now find Lynn!

1910
01:32:59,290 --> 01:32:59,810
Yes!

1911
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:00,850
Yes, sir.

1912
01:33:02,590 --> 01:33:03,110
God.

1913
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:06,690
If Inspector Cabanela gets word of this, it's all over.

1914
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:09,410
This poor guy.

1915
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:14,870
I can see why his wife left him.

1916
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:17,630
So our red-headed detective escaped, did she?

1917
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:20,050
But I just barely saved her a few minutes ago.

1918
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:21,090
She's fast.

1919
01:33:21,210 --> 01:33:22,490
Wait, but where's the detective?

1920
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:23,470
Cabanela?

1921
01:33:24,110 --> 01:33:25,730
I guess I'll look around for leads.

1922
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:28,250
Her notebook, obviously.

1923
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:30,230
Trick time!

1924
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:34,650
Don't touch that dial.

1925
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:36,410
Close.

1926
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:39,130
No, it's gonna open eventually.

1927
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:40,010
Or...

1928
01:33:42,330 --> 01:33:43,110
Oh, hold on.

1929
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:45,110
I want to get to that notebook up there.

1930
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:46,270
So we're going to...

1931
01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:47,330
Oh, no, wait.

1932
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:48,050
Wrong thing.

1933
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:48,530
My bad.

1934
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:49,570
Here?

1935
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:52,430
If I turn this around...

1936
01:33:54,710 --> 01:33:57,970
Will the steam somehow push it up?

1937
01:33:58,050 --> 01:33:58,610
I don't know.

1938
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:02,490
Lynn's notebook.

1939
01:34:02,690 --> 01:34:03,370
Sad and forgotten.

1940
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:04,670
Sits behind the bookshelves.

1941
01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:05,930
Who could...

1942
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:08,490
She had been calling on the phone before she hid it there.

1943
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:10,010
Wish I could find out.

1944
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:16,380
Hmm.

1945
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,700
Try square pillow as a side sleeper for...

1946
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:20,080
I've looked into squared pillow.

1947
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,440
Right now, I do have...

1948
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,780
I do use a specific pillow.

1949
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,500
I've always had back problems.

1950
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:25,920
Forever.

1951
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:27,160
Even as a ghost.

1952
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,500
Everything is hard.

1953
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:36,020
What's our guy doing over here?

1954
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,020
Oh, there's more people!

1955
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,680
I can't hear from here.

1956
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,340
Better get closer.

1957
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:41,600
Oh, okay.

1958
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:44,160
Is she down here?

1959
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:50,920
What's he saying?

1960
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,000
That old pigeon man.

1961
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:56,760
You suppose he is carrying out some sort of research here?

1962
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,970
In fact, problems could be bone related.

1963
01:35:04,290 --> 01:35:04,850
Yeah.

1964
01:35:05,070 --> 01:35:06,190
I have bad...

1965
01:35:06,190 --> 01:35:07,130
Well...

1966
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:08,850
I have...

1967
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:12,150
Now, it's like my bad bones transferred into my ghost life.

1968
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:12,550
You know what I mean?

1969
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:13,290
It kind of sucks.

1970
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:17,570
Look at all these precision instruments and complicated devices.

1971
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:20,030
Bad to the bone.

1972
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:21,850
Ba ba ba bad.

1973
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:23,870
Bad to the bone.

1974
01:35:26,150 --> 01:35:27,330
Phantom pain.

1975
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:29,910
What are you doing?

1976
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:32,870
Sir, I think this might be how Lynn escaped.

1977
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:33,670
Through here.

1978
01:35:37,230 --> 01:35:38,970
Through the poop chute.

1979
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:42,010
She couldn't possibly fit in that tiny little elevator?

1980
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:42,530
I'm sorry.

1981
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:43,790
Oh, I don't know, sir.

1982
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:45,050
Lynn is pretty slim.

1983
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:46,770
Why are you checking her out, huh?

1984
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:50,970
Don't you know that women can make themselves appear slim through fashion?

1985
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:58,210
You think if you had four minutes, you could at least die with better bones?

1986
01:36:00,610 --> 01:36:01,450
Oh my gosh.

1987
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:06,590
Four minutes before my death, I just shoved all the magnesium down my throat.

1988
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:12,690
The men found us out.

1989
01:36:14,490 --> 01:36:14,970
No.

1990
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:15,930
No.

1991
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:16,770
What do you mean through...

1992
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:18,490
What are you talking about, Edgeworth?

1993
01:36:18,730 --> 01:36:19,170
I mean...

1994
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:21,090
Prosecutor Payne.

1995
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:25,430
To this day, I still don't know how much my wife really weighs.

1996
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:26,930
You don't need to know that.

1997
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:29,030
I'm very sorry.

1998
01:36:29,170 --> 01:36:30,230
I had no idea, sir.

1999
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:34,170
You'll never make detective at that rate.

2000
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:35,050
This poor guy.

2001
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:37,830
This poor guy.

2002
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:40,990
Anyway, where is that old pigeon man?

2003
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:42,670
Oh, hey.

2004
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:42,970
That's him, sir.

2005
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:44,310
He went through the door behind me, sir.

2006
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,050
That one right there.

2007
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:47,650
That door.

2008
01:36:47,730 --> 01:36:47,910
Yeah.

2009
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:51,750
It won't open.

2010
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:55,790
Apparently, that door leads to the basement, but it's currently locked, sir.

2011
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:58,970
I'm starting to get why his wife left.

2012
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:00,870
These are two different guys.

2013
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:05,510
Time to gotcha.

2014
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:06,350
Don't know the timing again.

2015
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:08,230
This one was sent on 8.22 JST.

2016
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:14,350
A little over ten minutes.

2017
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:14,810
Okay.

2018
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:15,650
Like 15 minutes.

2019
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:18,350
15 minutes.

2020
01:37:19,810 --> 01:37:20,810
Not so bad.

2021
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:23,870
These instruments.

2022
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:25,170
They're all very suspicious.

2023
01:37:27,230 --> 01:37:29,310
You'd better keep your eye on that old man, too.

2024
01:37:30,690 --> 01:37:31,350
Yes, sir.

2025
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:39,250
If it involves a criminal, wouldn't you, like, bash the door down to try and get in there?

2026
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:39,590
You know?

2027
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:40,070
Like...

2028
01:37:41,550 --> 01:37:41,950
Okay.

2029
01:37:42,030 --> 01:37:44,790
So we have examined these before, but does he say anything different now?

2030
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:45,570
And now that Lin's not here.

2031
01:37:46,530 --> 01:37:50,770
It's just a little fragment of rock, a little pigeon guy, a strange taste of wild decor.

2032
01:37:51,130 --> 01:37:52,130
Okay, just a little bit.

2033
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,150
When is this gonna heat up?

2034
01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:01,450
Wait!

2035
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:08,470
I can't...

2036
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:10,930
I can't attach myself to him anymore.

2037
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:15,730
I can't...

2038
01:38:15,730 --> 01:38:16,050
Oh.

2039
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:19,730
I could swear that I just saw this thing move!

2040
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:21,190
Don't tell me.

2041
01:38:22,090 --> 01:38:23,090
This must be制限.

2042
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:28,630
I sensed the tension between me and the detective and I moved to get away from it.

2043
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:33,490
I think the detective... I think... or not the detective.

2044
01:38:33,790 --> 01:38:35,830
This guy might be my favorite character.

2045
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:37,570
Unnamed officer.

2046
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:39,390
He's so funny.

2047
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:45,130
I love unnamed officer.

2048
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:52,250
That was an unexpected tangent.

2049
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:55,110
I'll never make detective at this rate.

2050
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:55,610
No!

2051
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:58,550
Have more confidence in yourself!

2052
01:38:59,830 --> 01:39:00,390
No!

2053
01:39:02,230 --> 01:39:04,390
What I need is some sort of an achievement.

2054
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:05,530
Achievement.

2055
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:06,490
A feather in my cap.

2056
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:09,530
If only I could find a helpful lead that might...

2057
01:39:09,530 --> 01:39:10,210
The book!

2058
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:10,550
The book!

2059
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:10,870
The book!

2060
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:16,550
A helpful and blindingly obvious lead is staring you in the face right now!

2061
01:39:18,830 --> 01:39:19,650
There you go.

2062
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:29,850
I swallowed my spit wrong.

2063
01:39:32,350 --> 01:39:33,950
This is Lynn's notebook!

2064
01:39:34,690 --> 01:39:38,130
If I give this back to her it might spark something between...

2065
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:41,150
Spark something between us?

2066
01:39:41,170 --> 01:39:41,830
What do you mean by that?

2067
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,630
Isn't she your family detective?

2068
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:47,810
Um...

2069
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:50,670
What do you mean by that?

2070
01:39:54,130 --> 01:39:55,910
Didn't you say she's your family?

2071
01:39:56,570 --> 01:39:57,570
She's an angel.

2072
01:39:57,710 --> 01:39:58,550
No a friend.

2073
01:39:58,630 --> 01:39:59,390
A family.

2074
01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:01,950
What to do?

2075
01:40:02,030 --> 01:40:02,530
What to do?

2076
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:04,110
This is a very complicated matter.

2077
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:11,000
No, don't let him take your accomplishment.

2078
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:12,340
Don't let him take your accomplishment!

2079
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,360
What have you got there?

2080
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:17,620
What?

2081
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:17,940
This?

2082
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:21,180
This is... wait a minute.

2083
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:22,060
Is that...

2084
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:23,220
Yes, sir!

2085
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,220
Yes, sir!

2086
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,700
It's Lynn's notebook, sir!

2087
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:27,000
Notebook, eh?

2088
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,480
Come to think of it, there was something about that in the report.

2089
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:32,800
Something about her looking at her notebook and making a phone call.

2090
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:36,540
Don't let him take it from you!

2091
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:39,120
This must be it.

2092
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,760
This telephone number with the big circle around it.

2093
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,580
ViviCore, thank you for the five gifted.

2094
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:45,100
Thank you!

2095
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:47,740
Aren't you curious to know who she was calling?

2096
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:49,120
I am.

2097
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:49,960
I really am, sir.

2098
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:50,900
I'd like to know.

2099
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:52,140
Oh.

2100
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:55,680
But I don't have any ulterior motive for wanting to know, though.

2101
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:56,260
No, sir.

2102
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:56,680
No, sir.

2103
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,240
No, sir.

2104
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:03,460
This number might be an important lead.

2105
01:41:03,860 --> 01:41:05,020
I'd better check it out.

2106
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:10,560
This music is so Phoenix Wright.

2107
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:18,600
Trick time!

2108
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,960
When is this gonna go off, I wonder?

2109
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:26,940
I can't examine it yet.

2110
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,400
It's still closed.

2111
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:31,960
I'd like to see what's inside, but this guy has a death grip on it.

2112
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:32,720
I can't open it.

2113
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:36,600
I bet this detective never lets his prey escape once he gets a hold of it.

2114
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:39,040
Here we go!

2115
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:40,700
To

2116
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:45,210
whom am I speaking, please?

2117
01:41:47,210 --> 01:41:47,950
Yes, hello?

2118
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:51,050
This is a criminal investigation.

2119
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:52,270
We need your cooperation.

2120
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:54,330
Hey, I know that voice.

2121
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:56,290
Is that you, Detective McCaw?

2122
01:41:56,570 --> 01:41:58,810
What did I call him?

2123
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:03,010
Detective McCaw?

2124
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:07,970
Oh, is that Officer Bailey?

2125
01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:11,470
Detective...

2126
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:13,730
What's up, sir?

2127
01:42:13,850 --> 01:42:15,170
You don't usually call this late.

2128
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:17,810
Oh, uh...

2129
01:42:18,270 --> 01:42:20,690
Did you get a call from one of our detectives, Lynn, earlier?

2130
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:22,450
From Lynn?

2131
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:23,590
Yes, I did.

2132
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:24,510
She calls every night.

2133
01:42:25,290 --> 01:42:27,030
Maybe she senses it's about to happen.

2134
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:28,370
What is about to happen?

2135
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:30,310
Did she say anything special?

2136
01:42:31,290 --> 01:42:32,090
No, not really.

2137
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:32,950
Is something wrong?

2138
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:36,530
Ah, well, hold on.

2139
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:43,660
I might be contacting you again if I have any other questions.

2140
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:47,480
Okay.

2141
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:50,720
Trace complete.

2142
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:53,640
To... that place.

2143
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,780
I'm going to go file the report down at the station.

2144
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:00,600
I need you to be vigilant here.

2145
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,380
Excuse me, Detective, but...

2146
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:05,100
What is it?

2147
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:06,520
I know.

2148
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,000
Why would that guy sit in...

2149
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,200
He's avoiding the gamer posture, you guys.

2150
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:10,640
Everybody...

2151
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:12,640
That is peak sitting position.

2152
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,340
Everybody should know that.

2153
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:16,640
That's how I'm sitting literally right now.

2154
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:20,340
You don't sit like that?

2155
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:21,620
With your booty out?

2156
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:24,080
And your chest pushed forward?

2157
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:25,740
Like this?

2158
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,480
Oh, yes.

2159
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:29,540
This is peak performance.

2160
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:30,940
Obviously.

2161
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:36,180
Actually, let's all stretch.

2162
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:42,320
Oh, my arm.

2163
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:44,980
Sorry.

2164
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:45,960
It's the pinched nerve.

2165
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:48,720
What was I saying?

2166
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:49,740
Oh, that notebook.

2167
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:52,860
Would you mind if I gave...

2168
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:54,520
Oh, never mind, sir.

2169
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:58,400
Just stay on your toes.

2170
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:01,920
Grandma Mint, are you okay?

2171
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,480
Yeah, I'm fine.

2172
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:05,500
I'm okay.

2173
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:08,640
Trick time.

2174
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:12,220
When is this gonna heat up?

2175
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:15,600
Maybe when we come back.

2176
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:19,220
Maybe I have to wait.

2177
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:22,360
You almost did it.

2178
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:22,700
You did.

2179
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:24,940
Let's go to that new place.

2180
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:35,260
New people.

2181
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:36,460
Oh, no.

2182
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:38,440
Oh, my gosh.

2183
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:38,940
The shrimp.

2184
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:42,440
Was that...

2185
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,200
What was that call about?

2186
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,460
I heard you say Lynn.

2187
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:50,260
Why is it still like that?

2188
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:52,300
I don't really know.

2189
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:55,040
If I had to take a guess, though, I would probably say...

2190
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,980
Something's going on with her.

2191
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:05,820
The only place in the world where nothing is going on is inside your brain, Bailey.

2192
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:07,560
Burn.

2193
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:18,070
What is that supposed to mean?

2194
01:45:19,330 --> 01:45:21,150
I mean, I know what the words mean.

2195
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:22,490
That's not what I'm asking.

2196
01:45:23,230 --> 01:45:27,130
That was my way of expressing indignation.

2197
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:29,290
Putting it in the form of a question.

2198
01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:33,890
Sits back so polite.

2199
01:45:34,170 --> 01:45:35,270
Is that guy drinking wine?

2200
01:45:35,410 --> 01:45:36,190
On the job?

2201
01:45:37,110 --> 01:45:39,030
I just hope Lynn's not doing anything crazy.

2202
01:45:39,370 --> 01:45:40,570
I'm a fan of hers, you know?

2203
01:45:41,410 --> 01:45:42,530
According to my law...

2204
01:45:42,530 --> 01:45:43,570
Is she not a real detective?

2205
01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:45,330
Is she like an actress?

2206
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:50,470
Is she like an actress playing the role of a detective?

2207
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:52,250
And like...

2208
01:45:53,310 --> 01:45:54,510
She's not actually...

2209
01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:56,910
She doesn't actually know anything.

2210
01:46:04,850 --> 01:46:06,290
Just passed her test recently.

2211
01:46:06,430 --> 01:46:07,230
Oh yeah, so true.

2212
01:46:08,850 --> 01:46:10,290
According to my log...

2213
01:46:10,290 --> 01:46:13,170
Lynn has been calling here nearly every night as of late.

2214
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:14,930
So let's see.

2215
01:46:15,070 --> 01:46:17,610
This is the place Lynn took all that risk to call, eh?

2216
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:19,910
But what exactly is this place?

2217
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:22,870
Trick time...

2218
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:25,630
Trick time...

2219
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:26,190
Trick...

2220
01:46:26,190 --> 01:46:26,450
Oh.

2221
01:46:28,270 --> 01:46:28,370
Oh.

2222
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:30,190
Haha.

2223
01:46:30,530 --> 01:46:30,950
Ah.

2224
01:46:31,990 --> 01:46:32,750
Oh my gosh.

2225
01:46:32,850 --> 01:46:33,050
Wait.

2226
01:46:33,110 --> 01:46:34,130
The lever over there.

2227
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:35,850
You see it on the bottom, right?

2228
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:37,990
We can release all the inmates.

2229
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:41,510
Be free.

2230
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:44,290
Bro's posture.

2231
01:46:44,430 --> 01:46:45,050
Look at this.

2232
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:47,210
Wow.

2233
01:46:47,290 --> 01:46:47,590
Oi.

2234
01:46:47,650 --> 01:46:50,690
I didn't know I would need the eye tracker for this stream.

2235
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:52,450
Like, raps on Twitter.

2236
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:52,730
Okay.

2237
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:54,510
I'm so proud of you and you're freaking amazing.

2238
01:46:54,970 --> 01:46:55,570
Thank you.

2239
01:46:57,290 --> 01:46:57,890
Thank you.

2240
01:46:57,970 --> 01:46:58,190
Thank you.

2241
01:46:58,210 --> 01:46:58,250
Thank you.

2242
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:03,890
I don't think we can do anything here.

2243
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:04,830
Phew.

2244
01:47:05,470 --> 01:47:06,070
Except...

2245
01:47:07,370 --> 01:47:09,010
Except get an eyeful.

2246
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:09,990
Hahaha.

2247
01:47:12,370 --> 01:47:12,970
Um...

2248
01:47:12,970 --> 01:47:15,170
I guess we'll go back.

2249
01:47:17,570 --> 01:47:18,350
Oh wait!

2250
01:47:19,230 --> 01:47:19,830
Oh!

2251
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:21,690
Just kidding.

2252
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:24,050
I can let the memo loose.

2253
01:47:26,630 --> 01:47:28,110
There's a phone over there too.

2254
01:47:28,190 --> 01:47:28,230
Oh.

2255
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:32,150
Let's examine this monitor.

2256
01:47:33,290 --> 01:47:35,410
The screen shows rows of tiny rooms.

2257
01:47:35,650 --> 01:47:39,630
The rooms are really really small, and you can see right into them from the outside.

2258
01:47:40,370 --> 01:47:42,750
I suppose the open bars couldn't keep...

2259
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:48,110
Oh, the open bars keep the rooms airy, but I wouldn't want to live in one myself.

2260
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:50,750
I wonder where these little rooms are.

2261
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:53,870
I wonder.

2262
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:02,590
If I let myself go...

2263
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:11,060
Hey, what's this?

2264
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:14,520
Oh that?

2265
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:16,340
I wrote down my duties for the night.

2266
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:18,260
So I wouldn't forget any of them.

2267
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:21,280
You can't keep them in your head.

2268
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:23,500
It's not like you have a ton of duties.

2269
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:25,320
Why do you put them in quotes like that?

2270
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:26,660
After all...

2271
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:28,420
Use a little brain power.

2272
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:34,340
What are you talking about?

2273
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:36,440
Weren't you the one who said nothing?

2274
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:38,980
You guys, it's so Jover when I get 3D.

2275
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:42,680
And I can be able to do that every time I make a mistake in a video game.

2276
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:46,420
It's so over.

2277
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:50,000
I can't wait.

2278
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:55,900
Weren't you the one who just said nothing was going on inside my brain?

2279
01:48:58,160 --> 01:48:58,600
Hmm.

2280
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:00,940
Didn't think you'd take it in quite... wait.

2281
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:03,380
Didn't think you'd take it in quite that direction.

2282
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:08,620
What else are you saying?

2283
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:12,800
So let's see this important to-do list of yours.

2284
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:13,800
9.

2285
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:16,280
Take prisoner C-38 to the telephone room.

2286
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:17,540
Yes.

2287
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:20,360
He just made a request to use the phone a little while ago.

2288
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:22,540
9, eh?

2289
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:24,180
That's when Lin usually calls.

2290
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:27,500
The chair spin... yeah.

2291
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:31,600
Well, we can't let her talk to him tonight.

2292
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:32,780
Rules are rules.

2293
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:35,320
Aw, poor Lin.

2294
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,800
Sure wish I could comfort her.

2295
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:50,320
That's okay.

2296
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,380
I've got it all memorized for you.

2297
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:56,100
Well, it's your duty to guard the telephone room, you know?

2298
01:49:57,720 --> 01:49:58,280
Right there.

2299
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:00,740
Just make sure you do your job when the time comes.

2300
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:03,680
These guys are so goofy.

2301
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:04,140
I love it.

2302
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:06,200
He's gonna put up another memo- oh!

2303
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:08,760
Moshi moshi!

2304
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:14,040
Is it Lin?

2305
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,020
It's Lin!

2306
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:17,240
Oh.

2307
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:19,200
Spooky music.

2308
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:22,140
Hello?

2309
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:23,980
L-Lin!

2310
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:25,740
I'm sorry.

2311
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:26,780
I don't have much time.

2312
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:28,460
Please let me talk to him.

2313
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:30,240
I'm sorry, detective.

2314
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,640
I can't do that tonight.

2315
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:33,420
You can't?

2316
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:35,160
But you always let me talk to him before.

2317
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:39,940
Well, uh, the telephone room is already reserved.

2318
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:41,140
That's why.

2319
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:42,960
Or he's dead.

2320
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:46,300
Dun dun bum bum.

2321
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:47,680
Bum bum bum bum.

2322
01:50:48,780 --> 01:50:49,220
Oh.

2323
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:52,780
By the way, is something going on with you tonight?

2324
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:54,840
What?

2325
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:55,640
Why do you ask?

2326
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:59,700
I got a call from one of the other detectives a minute ago asking about you.

2327
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:01,880
Oh, really?

2328
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:04,900
Oh, well, I don't think it's, uh, anything important.

2329
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:06,220
Officer Bailey?

2330
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:09,180
Do you think you could keep this call just between us?

2331
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:11,000
Even if only for tonight?

2332
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,780
Well, I, uh...

2333
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:14,680
Oh!

2334
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:16,200
Look at the time!

2335
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:17,000
I gotta go!

2336
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:18,060
I'll call again tomorrow!

2337
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:22,120
Dang.

2338
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:23,300
Didn't even say bye.

2339
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:24,220
He hung up on her.

2340
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:27,220
Mysterious place.

2341
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:29,160
Oh, boy.

2342
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:31,280
Well, I guess I'd better call the detective division.

2343
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:31,720
No!

2344
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:33,920
Snitches!

2345
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:34,460
Snitches!

2346
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:34,900
Snitches!

2347
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:41,380
Don't do it, Officer Bailey.

2348
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:43,620
Don't do it.

2349
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:45,200
Hold on there, Bailey.

2350
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:46,580
What?

2351
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:50,140
Don't tell me you're gonna report that call from Lynn?

2352
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:52,380
What else can I do?

2353
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:53,540
It's my duty.

2354
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:57,060
Just write it down on one of your important to-do lists.

2355
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,620
And then I can wad it up for you in three days.

2356
01:51:59,620 --> 01:51:59,960
Throw it away!

2357
01:52:04,470 --> 01:52:07,490
You mean, you want me to keep quiet about it?

2358
01:52:10,470 --> 01:52:17,150
Well, isn't that what she asked you to- Why were you- Why were you eavesdropping on our call, huh?

2359
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:21,510
Well, yes, but...

2360
01:52:21,510 --> 01:52:24,050
Tonight is kind of a special case for us.

2361
01:52:25,070 --> 01:52:28,910
Can't you make a special exception for my li- What is

2362
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:35,080
up with all these people claiming Lynn?

2363
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:35,360
Lynn!

2364
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:40,080
Lynn does not belong to all of you!

2365
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:40,900
She belongs to me!

2366
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,960
I won't let any of you have her!

2367
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:49,320
Hands off!

2368
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:50,500
Hands off!

2369
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:51,120
Hands off!

2370
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:55,520
Oh, no!

2371
01:52:55,740 --> 01:52:56,220
No!

2372
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:56,960
Lynn!

2373
01:53:07,410 --> 01:53:08,530
Special case, huh?

2374
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:09,530
All right.

2375
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:10,150
You win.

2376
01:53:15,710 --> 01:53:16,510
Trick time!

2377
01:53:18,130 --> 01:53:18,930
Wait, so...

2378
01:53:18,930 --> 01:53:19,850
What is he going to say?

2379
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:21,850
I don't know what they think is special about tonight.

2380
01:53:22,110 --> 01:53:24,270
But for me, it's my only night.

2381
01:53:24,690 --> 01:53:26,510
Lynn is on the other end of that telephone line.

2382
01:53:26,610 --> 01:53:27,170
I'd better hurry.

2383
01:53:29,130 --> 01:53:31,750
Yeah, I was going to do his little memo, but...

2384
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:36,710
I guess we'll- I guess we'll go- I guess we'll dial...

2385
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:38,710
To here.

2386
01:53:42,490 --> 01:53:42,990
Oww-er.

2387
01:53:43,050 --> 01:53:43,130
Oh, my God.

2388
01:53:43,130 --> 01:53:43,750
Lynn...

2389
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:45,470
No...

2390
01:53:46,870 --> 01:53:47,350
No.

2391
01:53:50,350 --> 01:53:51,010
No way.

2392
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:52,370
Oh!

2393
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:55,630
Is it a rock?

2394
01:53:55,930 --> 01:53:56,410
Oh...

2395
01:53:56,410 --> 01:53:59,210
I was going to say a locked room case, but I said a rock.

2396
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:02,410
Is she dead again?

2397
01:54:05,590 --> 01:54:06,070
Lynn!

2398
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:11,760
Oh, why could it have been me instead?

2399
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:14,320
I'm no use as a police officer.

2400
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:15,800
It should have been...

2401
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:18,840
It should have been me!

2402
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:19,680
Not her!

2403
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:24,980
It should have been me!

2404
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:28,900
It should have been me!

2405
01:54:33,180 --> 01:54:34,760
It looks like she's dead.

2406
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,500
We'd better not touch her.

2407
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,080
Who did this?

2408
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:39,340
Who shot...

2409
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:42,500
Why do you assume it's a shot?

2410
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:43,760
A gunshot, huh?

2411
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:48,980
Why do you assume that, officer?

2412
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,340
Hey, excuse me, mister.

2413
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:55,360
Excuse me.

2414
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,200
Are you talking to me?

2415
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:00,180
Whoa!

2416
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:01,580
This room...

2417
01:55:02,370 --> 01:55:04,560
There aren't any... It is a locked room case!

2418
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:05,940
It is a locked room case!

2419
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:09,700
There aren't any other exits besides this one, are there?

2420
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:11,540
Do you see one?

2421
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:15,380
Well, there's like a hatch below.

2422
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:17,720
And how did...

2423
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:22,820
We must have one of those mysterious locked room murder cases on our hands!

2424
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:24,500
Murder!

2425
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:30,960
One of those cases where the murderer vanishes into thin air in a vacuum!

2426
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:33,800
Just go find a real detective.

2427
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:35,760
It's Umineko, let's go!

2428
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:38,260
I'll keep watch here.

2429
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:41,240
No, there was like a trap door in the middle of the room.

2430
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:44,240
Is this guy not a suspect?

2431
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:46,220
Why are we letting him stay with the body?

2432
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:49,680
Ah, what a terrible turn of events.

2433
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:53,220
So now a locked room murder, eh?

2434
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:55,840
Things never get dull for our redhead.

2435
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:59,840
I know of a certain inspector who might dance around at the thought of a mystery.

2436
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:01,000
Me.

2437
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:03,820
But no mysteries for me.

2438
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,640
Not when I can rewind time and talk to the victim herself.

2439
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:11,380
Guess it's time to go back and see the truth behind this murder with my own eyes.

2440
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:15,260
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

2441
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:18,380
I'm going ghost!

2442
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:21,700
I'm going lamp!

2443
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:22,880
I'm going girl!

2444
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:24,480
Or goose?

2445
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:28,520
Haha, I died again!

2446
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,980
I thought you'd be a little more grave under the circumstances.

2447
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:37,340
Man, she's not caring about her death at all.

2448
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:38,680
She doesn't care.

2449
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:41,280
She's just like, Not when I have you around!

2450
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:42,200
I found a rewind time!

2451
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:45,200
I

2452
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:50,480
died.

2453
01:56:50,620 --> 01:56:51,200
I died.

2454
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:54,500
So silly.

2455
01:56:54,940 --> 01:56:55,640
I died.

2456
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:03,850
How silly of me.

2457
01:57:03,970 --> 01:57:05,590
Oh my gosh, I just keep getting murdered.

2458
01:57:08,410 --> 01:57:09,570
That's so silly of me.

2459
01:57:13,290 --> 01:57:15,290
Yeah, well, this is the third time after all.

2460
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:17,610
It's scary what a girl can get used to, don't you think?

2461
01:57:19,970 --> 01:57:23,790
Frankly, the way her mind works is a whole heck of a lot scarier to me.

2462
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:25,950
Just feeling a little guilty.

2463
01:57:26,350 --> 01:57:27,510
Feeling a little goofy.

2464
01:57:27,650 --> 01:57:28,750
Might die tonight.

2465
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:35,250
So what happened this time?

2466
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:36,190
Who shot you?

2467
01:57:38,090 --> 01:57:38,830
I don't know.

2468
01:57:40,090 --> 01:57:40,530
Nani?

2469
01:57:41,770 --> 01:57:42,830
I'd like to know myself.

2470
01:57:43,090 --> 01:57:44,330
Who could have done it?

2471
01:57:45,470 --> 01:57:46,770
Who shot me?

2472
01:57:47,870 --> 01:57:48,390
Why?

2473
01:57:48,490 --> 01:57:49,950
What are you asking me for?

2474
01:57:51,050 --> 01:57:51,790
Oh boy.

2475
01:57:51,950 --> 01:57:53,670
Guess I'll have to go find out for myself.

2476
01:57:54,930 --> 01:57:55,450
Okay.

2477
01:57:55,570 --> 01:57:56,830
You just go do that.

2478
01:57:56,990 --> 01:57:57,790
Hurry along now.

2479
01:57:59,910 --> 01:58:03,190
I get the distinct impression I'm being used here.

2480
01:58:04,730 --> 01:58:05,450
Translator note.

2481
01:58:05,530 --> 01:58:06,350
Nani means what?

2482
01:58:07,990 --> 01:58:08,510
Okay.

2483
01:58:08,610 --> 01:58:10,450
Looks like it's time to go back.

2484
01:58:10,570 --> 01:58:13,330
Back to four minutes before your death.

2485
01:58:13,790 --> 01:58:14,310
Oh, I forgot.

2486
01:58:22,130 --> 01:58:22,790
Let's see.

2487
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:25,230
She called.

2488
01:58:26,650 --> 01:58:27,130
844.

2489
01:58:27,290 --> 01:58:29,130
Lots of fours in this game, huh?

2490
01:58:32,050 --> 01:58:32,530
Okay.

2491
01:58:32,710 --> 01:58:34,130
She hears something going on.

2492
01:58:34,270 --> 01:58:34,730
Oh.

2493
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:36,290
The doctor?

2494
01:58:36,610 --> 01:58:37,770
He looks really frightened.

2495
01:58:39,110 --> 01:58:42,510
How long has it been since I locked this room up in darkness?

2496
01:58:43,330 --> 01:58:43,810
Okay.

2497
01:58:43,870 --> 01:58:44,610
He's a weirdo.

2498
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:49,790
I thought, I once thought the truth could be discovered in darkness.

2499
01:58:50,450 --> 01:58:53,090
Oh my god, the Matryoshka dolls look so scary!

2500
01:58:55,710 --> 01:58:58,970
Maybe it was just that the time wasn't ripe.

2501
01:59:00,390 --> 01:59:02,590
Yeah, see there's a little thing in the middle of the floor.

2502
01:59:02,750 --> 01:59:05,870
Wait, so it's not only just a locked room case, but it's also dark?

2503
01:59:12,330 --> 01:59:13,250
Oh, she's hiding!

2504
01:59:13,390 --> 01:59:15,150
Oh my god, she can hide in there!

2505
01:59:16,410 --> 01:59:17,970
The guy was so right!

2506
01:59:20,090 --> 01:59:21,450
She... oh my god.

2507
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:26,250
That was so smooth!

2508
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:26,550
Oh!

2509
01:59:26,990 --> 01:59:30,670
With the power of fashion!

2510
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:34,150
Moshi moshi!

2511
01:59:38,970 --> 01:59:40,650
He hung up.

2512
01:59:43,050 --> 01:59:44,190
Oh, it's boiling!

2513
01:59:44,650 --> 01:59:44,850
Ow!

2514
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:46,310
His behind!

2515
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,220
Okay, there's a lot going on here.

2516
01:59:54,860 --> 01:59:55,800
There's Henya!

2517
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:59,960
Okay, goes into the dark room.

2518
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:01,160
Tippy toe.

2519
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:03,740
There's a lot of contraptions in here.

2520
02:00:03,980 --> 02:00:04,220
Oh!

2521
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:07,140
Uh oh.

2522
02:00:07,420 --> 02:00:09,480
Oh no, I don't think you should have done that!

2523
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:10,400
Oh my god.

2524
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:14,780
And it lights that on fire.

2525
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:16,400
And then...

2526
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:19,000
No way!

2527
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:21,220
What?!

2528
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,040
Don't just stand there!

2529
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:28,080
It's a booby trap!

2530
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:32,980
That's the truth behind our locked room murder?

2531
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:38,620
Okay, I saw the gun up there and I thought that it would probably be the thing that shot her, but...

2532
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:39,780
That's...

2533
02:00:41,540 --> 02:00:43,760
We got home alone for real.

2534
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:50,020
So the murderer was a mechanical murder machine?

2535
02:00:51,220 --> 02:00:52,080
Murder machine?

2536
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:56,060
When I came into the room, it was pitch dark, so I turned on the light.

2537
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:59,260
That must have been what set it off.

2538
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:00,940
The murder machine, I mean!

2539
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:04,400
Can you please stop repeating the words murder machine?

2540
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:07,400
That old pigeon guy must have made it.

2541
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:07,860
But why?

2542
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:11,040
What could be the meaning behind this?

2543
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:12,400
He's trying to figure something out!

2544
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:14,740
But he needs the...

2545
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:16,060
He's hiding it.

2546
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:19,840
If someone comes in to steal his research, they're gonna get murdered!

2547
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:21,180
By the murder machine!

2548
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:25,720
Anyway, you'll have to find some way to stop that creepy machine.

2549
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:29,040
Once Cupid fires his arrow, it's all over.

2550
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:30,500
Okay.

2551
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:34,680
Rewind time!

2552
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:38,740
Trick time!

2553
02:01:39,220 --> 02:01:40,680
Oh, we're starting from here?

2554
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:41,940
Interesting.

2555
02:01:43,980 --> 02:01:44,580
Okay.

2556
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:48,660
Uh, what is it?

2557
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:49,440
You know what, Cecil?

2558
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:53,660
I think this death might be easier to prevent than the others.

2559
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:54,840
Why is that?

2560
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:57,580
You know, because the murderer is mechanical.

2561
02:01:58,400 --> 02:01:59,100
She has...

2562
02:02:03,710 --> 02:02:05,190
Did I just disconnect?

2563
02:02:05,490 --> 02:02:06,090
Am I good?

2564
02:02:12,490 --> 02:02:13,090
I'm good?

2565
02:02:13,290 --> 02:02:13,770
Oh, okay.

2566
02:02:15,430 --> 02:02:16,330
For a second.

2567
02:02:16,450 --> 02:02:16,650
Oh.

2568
02:02:17,170 --> 02:02:17,690
Hmm.

2569
02:02:18,150 --> 02:02:18,670
Strange.

2570
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:20,210
Sorry about that.

2571
02:02:22,070 --> 02:02:23,830
I can't manipulate living creatures.

2572
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:25,590
But I can manipulate this machine.

2573
02:02:25,870 --> 02:02:27,710
Now I just gotta figure out how to stop it.

2574
02:02:28,490 --> 02:02:30,150
When the four minutes ago...

2575
02:02:30,150 --> 02:02:31,850
Me turns on the light...

2576
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:34,530
That's when the murder machine is set in motion, apparently.

2577
02:02:36,310 --> 02:02:40,730
So, it looks like the key to solving this one is understanding this device.

2578
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:43,490
Which I think we kind of get.

2579
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:46,790
Oh, yes.

2580
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:48,410
Locked up in the room in darkness.

2581
02:02:48,410 --> 02:02:48,650
And...

2582
02:02:48,650 --> 02:02:50,910
So, that's what we're gonna do.

2583
02:02:50,910 --> 02:02:52,950
Okay, let's try the old-school.

2584
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:53,310
We can...

2585
02:02:53,310 --> 02:02:53,990
We can...

2586
02:02:54,710 --> 02:02:55,650
Infiltrate the lamp.

2587
02:03:02,910 --> 02:03:03,650
Oh, interesting.

2588
02:03:06,490 --> 02:03:08,470
I don't think me going to...

2589
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:09,150
Oh, wait.

2590
02:03:09,190 --> 02:03:09,590
But then, no.

2591
02:03:09,670 --> 02:03:10,930
There's the motor up top.

2592
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:12,010
We do have to go upstairs.

2593
02:03:12,490 --> 02:03:14,930
I think we have to wait for the guy to...

2594
02:03:16,470 --> 02:03:17,250
To call.

2595
02:03:17,430 --> 02:03:19,490
And then we go through, right?

2596
02:03:19,490 --> 02:03:19,610
Right?

2597
02:03:21,250 --> 02:03:22,870
Oh, the telephone isn't working.

2598
02:03:23,110 --> 02:03:23,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2599
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:26,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2600
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:27,090
Okay.

2601
02:03:28,750 --> 02:03:30,250
Because there was the motor up top.

2602
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:33,510
So we'll wait for it to ring.

2603
02:03:35,030 --> 02:03:36,230
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.

2604
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:42,140
And he slides down.

2605
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:44,620
All cool, time is passing.

2606
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:48,460
Okay.

2607
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,520
Is this the superintendent?

2608
02:03:52,390 --> 02:03:53,000
I'm so glad.

2609
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:54,160
I thought I was all alone.

2610
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:58,360
Go there.

2611
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:00,940
Okay.

2612
02:04:08,110 --> 02:04:12,150
Okay, he hung up.

2613
02:04:13,370 --> 02:04:14,310
Trick time!

2614
02:04:15,290 --> 02:04:20,090
Okay, maybe we stop this from going off on your butt.

2615
02:04:21,250 --> 02:04:21,870
Oh!

2616
02:04:26,050 --> 02:04:28,190
And then you're gonna move it down here?

2617
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:35,900
Oh, this poor guy!

2618
02:04:43,690 --> 02:04:47,190
This is the Shinji pose for real.

2619
02:04:47,670 --> 02:04:49,370
Oh my gosh, Lin ran away.

2620
02:04:49,690 --> 02:04:51,150
The detectives yelled at me.

2621
02:04:51,290 --> 02:04:53,150
The old pigeon man ignored me.

2622
02:04:53,370 --> 02:04:55,730
Oh no, he's never going to become a detective at this rate.

2623
02:04:56,070 --> 02:04:58,290
And then the kettle nearly scared me to death.

2624
02:04:59,450 --> 02:05:01,750
My life is in complete shambles!

2625
02:05:04,910 --> 02:05:06,130
That's gratitude for you.

2626
02:05:06,370 --> 02:05:09,610
We were just trying to warn him with the kettle whistle.

2627
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:13,470
Would he have preferred getting scalded by the steam?

2628
02:05:14,770 --> 02:05:16,750
Well, at least his fate was changed a bit.

2629
02:05:17,030 --> 02:05:18,430
Yeah, we didn't burn his butt.

2630
02:05:19,570 --> 02:05:20,370
That's good anyway.

2631
02:05:24,070 --> 02:05:26,030
The fate has been changed for real!

2632
02:05:27,590 --> 02:05:28,870
Okay, so the ball.

2633
02:05:29,370 --> 02:05:29,810
Okay.

2634
02:05:29,810 --> 02:05:31,390
How did it go again?

2635
02:05:32,590 --> 02:05:33,710
The present...

2636
02:05:33,710 --> 02:05:35,590
The thing started spinning.

2637
02:05:36,570 --> 02:05:39,090
The fan started spinning, lifting the present.

2638
02:05:39,530 --> 02:05:42,530
And the ball spun over...

2639
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:48,290
I can't tell what everything is because it's hard to see.

2640
02:05:49,290 --> 02:05:51,030
Okay, I'm gonna have to...

2641
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:53,910
Okay.

2642
02:05:54,530 --> 02:05:55,350
Here we go.

2643
02:05:57,230 --> 02:06:00,090
I'm gonna have to be flung to somewhere.

2644
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:03,750
I have to be flung wherever.

2645
02:06:04,070 --> 02:06:04,590
I have to...

2646
02:06:05,350 --> 02:06:06,070
Okay, hold on.

2647
02:06:08,290 --> 02:06:09,050
I'm the toolbox!

2648
02:06:09,550 --> 02:06:09,930
Open!

2649
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:12,510
Okay, we went the wrong way.

2650
02:06:13,450 --> 02:06:13,830
Nice.

2651
02:06:14,710 --> 02:06:15,090
And...

2652
02:06:16,890 --> 02:06:17,990
Move the hoist!

2653
02:06:18,830 --> 02:06:19,810
I don't know what this does.

2654
02:06:20,350 --> 02:06:20,690
Oh no!

2655
02:06:20,770 --> 02:06:21,450
Oh no no no!

2656
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:22,130
Oh my god.

2657
02:06:22,630 --> 02:06:23,010
Wait!

2658
02:06:23,010 --> 02:06:23,990
Oh, I messed up!

2659
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:24,630
Maybe.

2660
02:06:26,970 --> 02:06:29,030
What did the bowling ball even do before?

2661
02:06:31,330 --> 02:06:32,330
Actually, I have no idea.

2662
02:06:35,110 --> 02:06:36,190
I missed it.

2663
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:37,350
Yeah, I think I did.

2664
02:06:40,830 --> 02:06:41,250
Oopsie!

2665
02:06:47,230 --> 02:06:47,810
That's okay.

2666
02:06:48,450 --> 02:06:50,230
We can go from when the fate was changed.

2667
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:56,330
The key to this murder machine is that cheeky little cupid who fires the arrow.

2668
02:06:56,550 --> 02:06:57,370
But we were close.

2669
02:06:57,430 --> 02:06:58,190
We were so close.

2670
02:06:58,530 --> 02:06:59,390
We were close.

2671
02:06:59,410 --> 02:06:59,810
We were close.

2672
02:06:59,910 --> 02:07:00,250
We were close.

2673
02:07:00,970 --> 02:07:02,130
Very tight timing.

2674
02:07:02,270 --> 02:07:02,470
Yeah.

2675
02:07:03,490 --> 02:07:04,270
But wait a minute.

2676
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:05,010
That swinging shovel.

2677
02:07:05,130 --> 02:07:05,350
Yes!

2678
02:07:05,390 --> 02:07:05,570
Yes!

2679
02:07:05,650 --> 02:07:05,770
Yes!

2680
02:07:06,770 --> 02:07:11,150
I wonder if that can be used as a weapon somehow against our cupid.

2681
02:07:12,710 --> 02:07:13,770
Guess I'd better rewind.

2682
02:07:13,950 --> 02:07:14,190
Yes.

2683
02:07:14,190 --> 02:07:15,250
After the fate change.

2684
02:07:15,410 --> 02:07:15,730
Okay.

2685
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:19,250
This trick took me a long time when I first played it.

2686
02:07:19,510 --> 02:07:19,910
Hmm.

2687
02:07:21,350 --> 02:07:22,630
I think we're...

2688
02:07:24,930 --> 02:07:25,930
It's not so bad.

2689
02:07:26,110 --> 02:07:26,450
Maybe.

2690
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:28,910
Maybe.

2691
02:07:29,010 --> 02:07:29,470
I hope not.

2692
02:07:30,690 --> 02:07:31,310
We'll see.

2693
02:07:31,490 --> 02:07:31,930
Okay.

2694
02:07:31,970 --> 02:07:32,370
Here we go.

2695
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:41,260
Do I need to...

2696
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:42,500
What do I do with this though?

2697
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:00,000
I don't remember if the...

2698
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:04,220
Did the shovel like fling into the air really fast?

2699
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:07,420
Yeah.

2700
02:08:07,460 --> 02:08:07,660
No.

2701
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:08,240
No.

2702
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:08,480
No.

2703
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:09,000
Spoil.

2704
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:09,220
No.

2705
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:09,420
No.

2706
02:08:09,420 --> 02:08:10,080
No hints.

2707
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:11,080
No hints, no hints.

2708
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:12,600
No hints, everybody.

2709
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:13,100
No hints.

2710
02:08:14,580 --> 02:08:15,200
Oh God.

2711
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:16,900
I would do timing...

2712
02:08:17,620 --> 02:08:18,240
Oh no.

2713
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:18,580
I didn't.

2714
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:19,180
I just...

2715
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:20,480
Okay.

2716
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:34,410
Trying to look at everything that I can posses.

2717
02:08:34,910 --> 02:08:35,390
Hmm.

2718
02:08:47,750 --> 02:08:48,610
Timing is everything.

2719
02:08:49,950 --> 02:08:50,430
Hm.

2720
02:08:50,890 --> 02:08:51,050
Oh...

2721
02:08:51,550 --> 02:08:52,030
Huh?

2722
02:08:53,310 --> 02:08:55,770
Yeah, Lynn's gonna just keep getting blasted, man.

2723
02:08:59,090 --> 02:09:00,970
Think about the timing as well.

2724
02:09:03,030 --> 02:09:03,510
Yeah.

2725
02:09:06,090 --> 02:09:06,870
That's true.

2726
02:09:34,590 --> 02:09:35,790
Cookmint, I believe you!

2727
02:09:36,350 --> 02:09:38,330
Sometimes it just takes me a second, okay?

2728
02:09:43,850 --> 02:09:47,130
Some people said it took them a long time to get stuff.

2729
02:09:47,130 --> 02:09:50,110
What is that thing behind the box?

2730
02:09:50,470 --> 02:09:51,510
I don't even know what that is.

2731
02:09:52,930 --> 02:09:54,370
The murder machine has started!

2732
02:09:54,770 --> 02:09:58,250
If the whole thing plays out, that gun will go off before that happens.

2733
02:09:58,550 --> 02:09:59,770
I need to use my ghost tricks.

2734
02:10:00,590 --> 02:10:03,110
There must be some way to disrupt this domino effect.

2735
02:10:04,410 --> 02:10:05,750
I just have to find it.

2736
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:07,550
Oh, wait!

2737
02:10:08,510 --> 02:10:09,150
Oh, shoot.

2738
02:10:09,370 --> 02:10:10,430
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2739
02:10:11,270 --> 02:10:13,610
I think... I think when the ball...

2740
02:10:14,110 --> 02:10:16,650
When the ball lands, I have to...

2741
02:10:17,150 --> 02:10:21,690
Time the ball landing to the shovel falling so it will...

2742
02:10:21,690 --> 02:10:24,830
So it will go... It will swing it up, I think.

2743
02:10:26,330 --> 02:10:27,450
Is what I have to do.

2744
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:33,300
Oh my god.

2745
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:34,460
Maybe now?

2746
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:45,140
That was pretty good just now.

2747
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:48,260
Maybe if we were on a... on a putting green.

2748
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:51,920
With a swing like that, maybe we could put it to use here.

2749
02:10:52,440 --> 02:10:53,100
Good thinking.

2750
02:10:53,220 --> 02:10:55,860
I was just... I just might be able to use this trick somehow.

2751
02:10:56,340 --> 02:10:58,420
If I could change the path the ball takes.

2752
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:01,520
Change... Okay.

2753
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:05,460
Change the path the ball takes.

2754
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:08,440
That's great and all, but it looks like we're all out of time this round.

2755
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:10,880
Is it this?

2756
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:12,340
What does this go to?

2757
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:16,780
Oh, I guess I'll never know.

2758
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:23,220
Okay.

2759
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:27,700
Okay.

2760
02:11:30,180 --> 02:11:30,960
We got this.

2761
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:33,800
Okay.

2762
02:11:33,980 --> 02:11:35,260
After the fight change.

2763
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:35,640
Okay.

2764
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:39,260
But what does the...

2765
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:43,540
Okay.

2766
02:11:45,860 --> 02:11:48,180
I still don't know what that thing down there is.

2767
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:51,760
And would this be...

2768
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:53,620
Wait, how would we change the direction?

2769
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:57,980
How would we change the direction?

2770
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:03,840
Why doesn't Lynn dodge it?

2771
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:04,500
Is she stupid?

2772
02:12:04,940 --> 02:12:05,420
Yeah.

2773
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,020
Maybe a little.

2774
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:11,600
Oh, I can't reach it.

2775
02:12:15,970 --> 02:12:16,890
Can I reach here?

2776
02:12:17,910 --> 02:12:20,270
I don't know if this does anything, but I'm gonna try it.

2777
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:23,470
Here we go.

2778
02:12:24,310 --> 02:12:25,050
Then here.

2779
02:12:26,930 --> 02:12:27,410
And...

2780
02:12:28,090 --> 02:12:29,730
I don't know if this will do anything.

2781
02:12:29,950 --> 02:12:30,350
Open!

2782
02:12:30,790 --> 02:12:31,470
Oh, gosh.

2783
02:12:33,810 --> 02:12:35,410
No, that didn't do anything.

2784
02:12:39,310 --> 02:12:40,590
How do I change it?

2785
02:12:49,620 --> 02:12:50,100
Um...

2786
02:12:51,180 --> 02:12:56,100
I don't know if it will let me go back into the ball when I push it.

2787
02:12:56,740 --> 02:12:57,480
But maybe.

2788
02:12:57,640 --> 02:12:58,080
Let's see.

2789
02:12:58,560 --> 02:12:59,800
Ride the ball after it's hit.

2790
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:01,440
That's what I'm gonna see if I can do.

2791
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:02,860
I don't...

2792
02:13:02,860 --> 02:13:04,200
I don't know if it will let me...

2793
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:08,400
If it counts as a cutscene or if it will let me ghost trick a little bit.

2794
02:13:08,540 --> 02:13:09,100
I have no idea.

2795
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:10,500
We'll see.

2796
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:14,920
Oh, before it falls.

2797
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:16,820
No, but I have to...

2798
02:13:18,660 --> 02:13:20,820
I have to open the toolbox.

2799
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:23,320
Oh, but you mean like...

2800
02:13:23,320 --> 02:13:23,540
Wait.

2801
02:13:28,710 --> 02:13:31,530
Maybe like with the most tightest of timings.

2802
02:13:35,850 --> 02:13:36,650
Oh, no.

2803
02:13:36,790 --> 02:13:37,830
It wouldn't let me ghost trick.

2804
02:13:37,870 --> 02:13:38,050
No.

2805
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:38,790
Oh, no.

2806
02:13:38,870 --> 02:13:39,370
It won't let me.

2807
02:13:40,990 --> 02:13:41,390
No.

2808
02:13:41,430 --> 02:13:42,410
It won't let me.

2809
02:13:45,310 --> 02:13:45,710
Yeah,

2810
02:13:49,450 --> 02:13:50,210
it's a cutscene.

2811
02:13:57,950 --> 02:13:58,950
This one's tricky.

2812
02:14:01,130 --> 02:14:02,470
This one's kinda tricky.

2813
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:12,300
This box...

2814
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:14,240
I don't know how to reach it.

2815
02:14:16,820 --> 02:14:17,300
Unless...

2816
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:19,660
Okay, hold on.

2817
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:20,220
Let me try something.

2818
02:14:20,660 --> 02:14:23,440
Unless when the ball is on the table, I can go to it.

2819
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:26,780
And then it does whatever it does.

2820
02:14:26,860 --> 02:14:27,960
I'm not sure what it does.

2821
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:29,500
But it might do something.

2822
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:37,880
Oh, no.

2823
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:38,820
It's just a toy cake.

2824
02:14:39,020 --> 02:14:39,500
Are you serious?

2825
02:14:39,820 --> 02:14:40,260
Wait.

2826
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:41,000
Door.

2827
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:41,500
Door.

2828
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:42,040
Door.

2829
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:42,280
Door.

2830
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:42,980
Door.

2831
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:43,220
Door.

2832
02:14:43,220 --> 02:14:43,340
Door.

2833
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:43,580
Door.

2834
02:14:43,620 --> 02:14:44,060
Door.

2835
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:44,180
Door.

2836
02:14:44,180 --> 02:14:44,380
Door.

2837
02:14:44,380 --> 02:14:44,420
Door.

2838
02:14:47,740 --> 02:14:48,180
Door.

2839
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:49,160
There we go.

2840
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:51,280
Oh.

2841
02:15:04,810 --> 02:15:05,670
Oh my gosh.

2842
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:07,610
I thought it just set everything on fire.

2843
02:15:10,170 --> 02:15:11,270
What just happened?

2844
02:15:12,190 --> 02:15:16,170
Looks like your future just got a whole lot rose... rose-ier.

2845
02:15:18,230 --> 02:15:19,350
Happy birthday!

2846
02:15:21,970 --> 02:15:23,790
Your death has been erased.

2847
02:15:24,510 --> 02:15:25,070
I...

2848
02:15:27,390 --> 02:15:28,230
Thank you.

2849
02:15:29,450 --> 02:15:31,510
You kept your promise, didn't you, Sissel?

2850
02:15:31,510 --> 02:15:31,530
I...

2851
02:15:32,490 --> 02:15:33,250
My promise.

2852
02:15:33,330 --> 02:15:35,190
And now she can escape through the trapdoor.

2853
02:15:36,450 --> 02:15:38,270
You said I'd see you again if I died.

2854
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:40,710
I don't remember making any promises.

2855
02:15:41,210 --> 02:15:42,690
It's all for my own benefit, anyway.

2856
02:15:45,130 --> 02:15:45,890
Fate averted!

2857
02:15:47,230 --> 02:15:48,890
What could this room be all about?

2858
02:15:49,630 --> 02:15:50,750
I can't imagine.

2859
02:15:51,450 --> 02:15:53,070
Those things that went off at the end.

2860
02:15:53,170 --> 02:15:54,070
Those were party poppers.

2861
02:15:54,170 --> 02:15:54,490
Oh, no.

2862
02:15:54,550 --> 02:15:55,310
Did they hear them?

2863
02:15:55,350 --> 02:15:56,290
Did they hear the potty pop...

2864
02:15:56,290 --> 02:15:57,310
Potty is the...

2865
02:15:57,810 --> 02:15:58,210
No!

2866
02:15:58,590 --> 02:16:00,410
The party poppers!

2867
02:16:00,830 --> 02:16:01,510
I can't imagine.

2868
02:16:01,510 --> 02:16:04,050
I have no recollection of what they are, but that's no surprise.

2869
02:16:06,730 --> 02:16:08,590
I said it with an accent, you guys.

2870
02:16:08,770 --> 02:16:10,030
The party poppers.

2871
02:16:10,370 --> 02:16:11,970
I just said it with an accent.

2872
02:16:12,330 --> 02:16:14,070
I didn't say party poppers.

2873
02:16:14,110 --> 02:16:15,970
I said the potty poppers.

2874
02:16:17,890 --> 02:16:19,290
It's the party poppers.

2875
02:16:19,990 --> 02:16:21,090
The party poppers.

2876
02:16:21,130 --> 02:16:22,030
The gun going off.

2877
02:16:22,150 --> 02:16:23,430
It seems familiar, somehow.

2878
02:16:25,110 --> 02:16:26,830
I'll leave that part of the puzzle to you.

2879
02:16:26,990 --> 02:16:29,390
I have my own puzzle to figure out.

2880
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:31,490
Well, shall we go back?

2881
02:16:39,290 --> 02:16:41,170
No saving this one, boss!

2882
02:16:41,370 --> 02:16:42,190
What do you mean?

2883
02:16:45,230 --> 02:16:46,750
Okay, now you can leave.

2884
02:16:47,270 --> 02:16:49,570
Or you can investigate what's going on in here.

2885
02:16:50,250 --> 02:16:51,570
Cecil, are you there?

2886
02:16:51,810 --> 02:16:53,170
Oh, she remembers me.

2887
02:16:53,550 --> 02:16:55,150
Lin is talking to me?

2888
02:16:57,710 --> 02:16:58,190
Yes.

2889
02:16:59,170 --> 02:17:00,810
If you're there, could you say something?

2890
02:17:01,330 --> 02:17:05,570
If you're not there... I guess I'm just a weird girl who talks to herself.

2891
02:17:06,490 --> 02:17:07,330
She remembers!

2892
02:17:08,010 --> 02:17:09,950
Well, you are kind of a weird girl.

2893
02:17:10,070 --> 02:17:11,630
Whether you talk to yourself or not.

2894
02:17:13,430 --> 02:17:14,250
Trick time!

2895
02:17:14,450 --> 02:17:15,150
What do we say?

2896
02:17:18,890 --> 02:17:19,370
Talk?

2897
02:17:19,370 --> 02:17:19,850
Wait...

2898
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:24,540
You are here!

2899
02:17:24,620 --> 02:17:25,400
I knew it!

2900
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:26,760
I just had that feeling.

2901
02:17:26,900 --> 02:17:27,700
Wait, what?

2902
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:32,100
Shame on you for stepping foot into a girl's head uninvited.

2903
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:33,960
Wait a minute.

2904
02:17:37,740 --> 02:17:38,780
Poshmint, my beloved.

2905
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:45,100
Don't give me that a ghost doesn't have feet bit.

2906
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:47,160
I have feet.

2907
02:17:48,180 --> 02:17:48,660
Sometimes.

2908
02:17:49,740 --> 02:17:51,220
It's just a figure of speech.

2909
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:53,120
Depends on how much energy I have.

2910
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:56,020
How much ghostly energy I have, you know?

2911
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:58,540
Yeah, but she did invite him.

2912
02:17:58,560 --> 02:17:58,880
I'm so true.

2913
02:17:59,240 --> 02:18:00,880
Hey, did I say anything?

2914
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:02,260
There!

2915
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:02,780
That tone!

2916
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,240
It's that tone of yours that makes me mad!

2917
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:07,360
Oh, sorry.

2918
02:18:07,440 --> 02:18:08,260
She has an accent now.

2919
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:11,080
So did you have something particular you wanted to say to me?

2920
02:18:12,780 --> 02:18:13,780
Hmm... in British.

2921
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:17,060
I just thought I'd share some information with you.

2922
02:18:17,540 --> 02:18:19,520
I'm investigating a case right now.

2923
02:18:20,060 --> 02:18:21,380
A murder case.

2924
02:18:21,640 --> 02:18:23,140
And I'm doing it alone.

2925
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:26,940
A murder case?

2926
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:28,060
All by yourself?

2927
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:33,120
Yes, well, that's because the case was closed a long time ago.

2928
02:18:35,660 --> 02:18:38,280
The culprit is already behind bars.

2929
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:40,120
Forgotten by the world.

2930
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:41,900
I think it's the lamp.

2931
02:18:42,580 --> 02:18:44,680
I think it's the lamp making amends.

2932
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:51,020
So why are you lo- Or the person that was murdered by the lamp.

2933
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:52,720
I mean, the guy behind bars.

2934
02:19:00,620 --> 02:19:02,320
So why are you looking into it then?

2935
02:19:03,380 --> 02:19:05,420
Because I think the person's innocent.

2936
02:19:05,640 --> 02:19:06,320
That's why.

2937
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:09,620
There's something strange behind the case.

2938
02:19:09,800 --> 02:19:11,100
Some big mystery.

2939
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:12,860
I firmly believe that.

2940
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:17,160
So anyway, I'll- I finally have my memory back.

2941
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:20,520
I'm not at liberty to tell you about the case.

2942
02:19:21,360 --> 02:19:24,180
But if there's any- I'm so sorry if you're British by the way.

2943
02:19:24,840 --> 02:19:25,880
Because you're British.

2944
02:19:26,060 --> 02:19:28,720
And also because I'm probably really butchering this accent.

2945
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:37,360
But if there's anything else you want to know, I'll try to answer what I can.

2946
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:40,960
We deserve it.

2947
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:41,880
No!

2948
02:19:43,720 --> 02:19:45,020
Played by Emma Watson.

2949
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:46,120
That's who I'm channeling.

2950
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:47,980
Lin is my only lead.

2951
02:19:48,180 --> 02:19:50,380
I would like to ask her about a few things.

2952
02:19:52,140 --> 02:19:53,400
About the girl with the bow.

2953
02:19:53,540 --> 02:19:53,880
Oh yeah!

2954
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:56,040
What about about the dog?

2955
02:19:56,900 --> 02:19:57,340
What?

2956
02:19:57,980 --> 02:20:00,260
You have your life and your memory back now.

2957
02:20:00,480 --> 02:20:01,740
So let me ask you again.

2958
02:20:02,460 --> 02:20:03,660
Who shot me tonight?

2959
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:08,580
Yeah, I thought that might be the first thing on your mind.

2960
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:10,320
What else would it be?

2961
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:14,280
There's a good chance I was shot while I was with you after all.

2962
02:20:15,060 --> 02:20:18,540
I'm afraid my memory just isn't clear on that part.

2963
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:20,100
Not clear?

2964
02:20:21,300 --> 02:20:22,580
I met with you tonight.

2965
02:20:23,240 --> 02:20:25,520
And then you fell down right in front of me.

2966
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:27,500
I think I remember seeing that part.

2967
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:30,120
I'm pretty sure you were shot.

2968
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:32,300
Maybe from somewhere far away.

2969
02:20:33,820 --> 02:20:34,960
Two steps ahead!

2970
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:39,040
So you didn't see the culprit.

2971
02:20:39,660 --> 02:20:40,440
I'm sorry.

2972
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:42,360
I wish I could be of more help.

2973
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:45,460
But I know I wasn't the one who shot you.

2974
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:48,740
Your colleagues seem to think you're a suspect though.

2975
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:53,920
I wanted the information you had for me.

2976
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:56,760
So why would I shoot you before I got it?

2977
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:57,680
So true.

2978
02:20:58,800 --> 02:20:59,480
Information, huh?

2979
02:20:59,780 --> 02:21:01,600
I wonder what info I had for her.

2980
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:02,120
It's me.

2981
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:03,840
I was the murderer.

2982
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:08,000
About the dog.

2983
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:09,040
Oh, dang.

2984
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:10,340
About the girl with the bow.

2985
02:21:12,140 --> 02:21:14,060
By the way, I see you have a little roommate.

2986
02:21:15,580 --> 02:21:15,980
Camilla?

2987
02:21:16,580 --> 02:21:17,840
How do you know about her?

2988
02:21:18,820 --> 02:21:22,580
There was a tiny incident at your apartment a little while ago.

2989
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:24,520
An incident?

2990
02:21:24,780 --> 02:21:25,940
What kind of incident?

2991
02:21:26,940 --> 02:21:27,900
What happened?

2992
02:21:28,060 --> 02:21:29,240
Is Camilla all right?

2993
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:31,320
She's fine.

2994
02:21:31,480 --> 02:21:33,100
Thanks to her loyal little friend...

2995
02:21:34,340 --> 02:21:34,940
Missile!

2996
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:35,840
Yeah!

2997
02:21:36,220 --> 02:21:36,820
Missile!

2998
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:38,560
It's a good boy, Missile!

2999
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:39,080
Missile!

3000
02:21:40,440 --> 02:21:43,500
Although I did have a little trouble bringing him back to life.

3001
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:45,100
Oh my!

3002
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:46,840
Oh, it's horrible!

3003
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:48,380
Oh my god!

3004
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:50,660
Bloody hell!

3005
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:52,600
What in the world is going on?

3006
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:55,960
Why would anybody target to hurt Camilla and Missile?

3007
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:59,300
You're being targeted by a certain organization.

3008
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:01,140
Missile Mansion!

3009
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:01,780
Yeah!

3010
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:03,840
What?

3011
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:06,340
I saw them.

3012
02:22:06,440 --> 02:22:08,480
The people who were calling you their target.

3013
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:13,020
So I'm a suspect and a target.

3014
02:22:13,300 --> 02:22:15,760
Could this night possibly get any worse?

3015
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:18,280
This sounds pretty rough.

3016
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:20,420
Are you sure you'll be okay on your own?

3017
02:22:21,540 --> 02:22:23,200
English Mint is killing me.

3018
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:23,760
Sorry.

3019
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:25,960
Huh?

3020
02:22:25,960 --> 02:22:27,080
You know what they say.

3021
02:22:27,220 --> 02:22:30,220
When it rains, it pours.

3022
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:34,320
Isn't it time you admitted you need me?

3023
02:22:34,380 --> 02:22:35,820
Need my powers?

3024
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:38,840
I'm sorry.

3025
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:41,000
I can't cooperate with you.

3026
02:22:42,860 --> 02:22:45,400
Yes, you saved my life tonight three times!

3027
02:22:47,980 --> 02:22:49,760
I'm completely grateful for that.

3028
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:53,140
But as a detective, I still can't trust you.

3029
02:22:54,440 --> 02:22:55,800
That's too bad.

3030
02:22:57,760 --> 02:22:59,040
And about the information.

3031
02:22:59,480 --> 02:23:00,360
And the dog.

3032
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:04,480
So I had some important information that you wanted, huh?

3033
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:11,360
I think... I feel like you could trust me even more because I have no memory.

3034
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:12,800
Right?

3035
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:14,040
Levios saw.

3036
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:16,300
That's right.

3037
02:23:16,820 --> 02:23:18,460
You called the station yesterday.

3038
02:23:19,740 --> 02:23:21,360
And you asked to talk to me.

3039
02:23:22,140 --> 02:23:25,720
You told me you had an important lead on the case I was working on.

3040
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:29,160
Important lead, eh?

3041
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:35,440
You said you wanted to meet me and talk to me directly.

3042
02:23:35,740 --> 02:23:36,260
Tonight.

3043
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:37,460
At the junkyard.

3044
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:38,720
Important.

3045
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:40,960
And you fell for it?

3046
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:43,100
Even given how fishy it sounds?

3047
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:47,460
You're the last person I want to hear that from, you know?

3048
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:50,200
But I just couldn't let it go.

3049
02:23:50,420 --> 02:23:52,260
No matter how shady it seemed.

3050
02:23:52,880 --> 02:23:54,260
I'm walking here.

3051
02:23:56,920 --> 02:23:58,880
That's because I'm running out of time.

3052
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:00,100
Oh my god.

3053
02:24:00,140 --> 02:24:02,000
Are they gonna kill that guy in the jail?

3054
02:24:03,100 --> 02:24:03,960
Hey, that's right.

3055
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:05,820
You said something was going down tonight.

3056
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:07,820
Is he gonna die?

3057
02:24:08,300 --> 02:24:10,760
Does that something have to do with the case you're working on?

3058
02:24:12,640 --> 02:24:13,340
I'm sorry.

3059
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:14,920
But I can't talk about it.

3060
02:24:14,980 --> 02:24:15,380
You stop!

3061
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:17,120
Stop being so mysterious!

3062
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:19,720
Oh boy.

3063
02:24:20,020 --> 02:24:21,100
But I guess I understand.

3064
02:24:21,940 --> 02:24:23,160
Death sentence, maybe.

3065
02:24:25,700 --> 02:24:29,190
Oh wow.

3066
02:24:29,710 --> 02:24:30,150
Okay.

3067
02:24:31,430 --> 02:24:33,210
Let's stop dilly-dallying here.

3068
02:24:33,750 --> 02:24:35,010
So what are you gonna do now?

3069
02:24:36,550 --> 02:24:37,330
Run, I guess.

3070
02:24:37,630 --> 02:24:39,710
They'll catch me again if I don't get out of here.

3071
02:24:40,150 --> 02:24:41,130
What is this accent?

3072
02:24:41,290 --> 02:24:42,450
I don't even know anymore.

3073
02:24:42,450 --> 02:24:43,950
And I have to get to the restaurant.

3074
02:24:44,370 --> 02:24:45,750
I'm worried about Camilla.

3075
02:24:47,350 --> 02:24:48,590
Oh yeah, what was it?

3076
02:24:48,650 --> 02:24:50,890
The chicken kitchen on Dead End Drive, right?

3077
02:24:53,570 --> 02:24:54,610
What about you, Cecil?

3078
02:24:54,770 --> 02:24:55,810
What are you going to do?

3079
02:24:55,870 --> 02:24:57,310
I'm gonna follow you!

3080
02:24:59,590 --> 02:25:01,130
I don't know, to tell you the truth.

3081
02:25:02,490 --> 02:25:04,270
You're my only lead.

3082
02:25:04,590 --> 02:25:05,950
If you leave...

3083
02:25:06,870 --> 02:25:07,950
Yeah, feel guilty.

3084
02:25:08,090 --> 02:25:08,630
Feel bad.

3085
02:25:08,870 --> 02:25:10,250
I just saved your life three times.

3086
02:25:10,250 --> 02:25:14,530
I just realized you and I are in the same boat.

3087
02:25:15,330 --> 02:25:19,930
We're both looking for answers tonight, and neither one of us has anybody to help us.

3088
02:25:20,790 --> 02:25:22,390
Why do you have an accent again?

3089
02:25:23,370 --> 02:25:28,250
Hey, even if you can't cooperate with me, how about if we just agree to use each other?

3090
02:25:31,790 --> 02:25:33,130
That's not a bad idea.

3091
02:25:33,710 --> 02:25:34,470
You're on.

3092
02:25:35,510 --> 02:25:38,730
But can I ask you to do a favor for me, first?

3093
02:25:40,430 --> 02:25:41,070
What's that?

3094
02:25:42,030 --> 02:25:44,730
I need you to sneak into a certain place for me.

3095
02:25:45,250 --> 02:25:46,890
A prison, to be exact.

3096
02:25:47,290 --> 02:25:48,250
The prison!

3097
02:25:49,070 --> 02:25:49,550
Prison!

3098
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:49,910
Prison!

3099
02:25:50,390 --> 02:25:50,870
Prison!

3100
02:25:51,930 --> 02:25:54,250
That's the place I was calling from the office upstairs.

3101
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:58,990
I want you to go find out a certain prisoner's work schedule for tomorrow.

3102
02:26:01,350 --> 02:26:01,970
Uh-oh.

3103
02:26:02,770 --> 02:26:03,550
I don't know.

3104
02:26:03,610 --> 02:26:04,750
I don't like the sound of this.

3105
02:26:06,390 --> 02:26:07,190
Work schedule?

3106
02:26:07,450 --> 02:26:08,130
For a prisoner?

3107
02:26:09,010 --> 02:26:09,530
Yes.

3108
02:26:09,790 --> 02:26:12,770
The prisoners are given different job details every day.

3109
02:26:13,070 --> 02:26:17,610
Each prisoner's schedule for the next day is written on a small blackboard in his cell.

3110
02:26:18,670 --> 02:26:21,930
So just go check out a certain prisoner's blackboard, huh?

3111
02:26:22,690 --> 02:26:23,210
Okay.

3112
02:26:25,410 --> 02:26:28,990
His prisoner number is D99.

3113
02:26:32,510 --> 02:26:33,030
Do.

3114
02:26:33,030 --> 02:26:37,750
If you do that for me, I'll cooperate with you.

3115
02:26:38,590 --> 02:26:39,190
Okay.

3116
02:26:39,190 --> 02:26:40,050
You're on.

3117
02:26:41,210 --> 02:26:41,810
Here.

3118
02:26:42,270 --> 02:26:45,250
Let me give you the Chicken Kitchen's telephone number.

3119
02:26:45,870 --> 02:26:46,990
All right.

3120
02:26:47,350 --> 02:26:47,670
Easy.

3121
02:26:49,250 --> 02:26:50,450
Chicken Kitchen.

3122
02:26:56,070 --> 02:26:56,670
Oh.

3123
02:26:56,670 --> 02:26:57,730
Where are we now?

3124
02:26:58,710 --> 02:26:59,630
Smell you later.

3125
02:27:00,530 --> 02:27:01,330
See ya.

3126
02:27:02,410 --> 02:27:03,490
But don't die again.

3127
02:27:03,670 --> 02:27:04,630
If you can help it.

3128
02:27:09,590 --> 02:27:10,690
Oh, we're in the sewer.

3129
02:27:10,870 --> 02:27:10,930
Oh.

3130
02:27:11,770 --> 02:27:12,170
Lamp!

3131
02:27:18,070 --> 02:27:18,990
He's like, yippee!

3132
02:27:22,030 --> 02:27:24,770
It looks like I hold the key to the case Lin is investigating.

3133
02:27:25,110 --> 02:27:27,450
And she holds the key to solving the mystery of me.

3134
02:27:27,950 --> 02:27:30,870
So we've started up a strange relationship of cooperation.

3135
02:27:33,150 --> 02:27:34,910
Lin gave me an assignment.

3136
02:27:35,370 --> 02:27:39,090
My task is to go check out tomorrow's work schedule for prisoner D99.

3137
02:27:39,750 --> 02:27:40,950
I'd better get to the prison.

3138
02:27:44,710 --> 02:27:45,150
Yippee!

3139
02:27:45,150 --> 02:27:46,150
But in grandpa voice.

3140
02:27:47,290 --> 02:27:49,850
I love this little contraption he has going on in here.

3141
02:27:49,930 --> 02:27:51,050
But what is he researching?

3142
02:27:51,230 --> 02:27:52,770
It's the stuff with the rocks, right?

3143
02:27:54,250 --> 02:27:55,950
There's so many parts of this game.

3144
02:27:56,110 --> 02:27:57,810
I'm not really cooking much.

3145
02:27:57,950 --> 02:27:59,590
I don't really cook much in games.

3146
02:27:59,590 --> 02:28:01,550
I kind of just like to...

3147
02:28:03,810 --> 02:28:04,330
To...

3148
02:28:05,170 --> 02:28:06,790
Be surprised, you know?

3149
02:28:06,790 --> 02:28:07,810
Oh, it's 9.03 PM!

3150
02:28:09,130 --> 02:28:10,750
Secret Seeker, welcome to membership.

3151
02:28:10,910 --> 02:28:11,430
Thank you!

3152
02:28:13,750 --> 02:28:15,510
Yeah, just go with the flow.

3153
02:28:15,630 --> 02:28:15,810
Yeah.

3154
02:28:16,630 --> 02:28:18,070
Lost memories of self.

3155
02:28:18,290 --> 02:28:19,530
A forgotten murder case.

3156
02:28:19,790 --> 02:28:24,150
A dead guy and a detective joined forces to find out the truth behind them both.

3157
02:28:25,710 --> 02:28:27,730
Everything is so disjointed at the moment anyway.

3158
02:28:27,930 --> 02:28:28,590
Yeah, true.

3159
02:28:28,590 --> 02:28:31,950
The detective assigned the dead guy a task.

3160
02:28:32,230 --> 02:28:36,050
To sneak into the prison and find out a certain prisoner's schedule for tomorrow.

3161
02:28:36,850 --> 02:28:38,290
I like this music here.

3162
02:28:40,870 --> 02:28:41,870
What should I care?

3163
02:28:43,030 --> 02:28:44,490
I don't have a schedule for tomorrow.

3164
02:28:44,790 --> 02:28:46,750
That's how I'm feeling about it at the moment.

3165
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:52,140
Trick time!

3166
02:28:53,480 --> 02:28:57,820
Alright, let's get back to a phone here.

3167
02:28:59,380 --> 02:29:00,840
That's why this moves.

3168
02:29:01,800 --> 02:29:02,380
Sneaky.

3169
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:05,080
Sneaky, sneaky.

3170
02:29:07,360 --> 02:29:07,940
Grandpa.

3171
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:11,360
Our detective!

3172
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:15,400
Oh my god.

3173
02:29:17,140 --> 02:29:18,620
It's all over.

3174
02:29:22,360 --> 02:29:23,340
It's all over.

3175
02:29:23,800 --> 02:29:25,220
It's all over for me.

3176
02:29:25,780 --> 02:29:26,360
Lin.

3177
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:29,460
Sweet, cute Lin who shines as bright as the sun.

3178
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:32,520
Ran away from... ran away on me.

3179
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:37,900
And then those detectives matching bookends blue and green yelled at me.

3180
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:40,940
Forget all about that.

3181
02:29:41,140 --> 02:29:42,620
Now you listen to me, kid.

3182
02:29:44,140 --> 02:29:44,660
Yes.

3183
02:29:45,960 --> 02:29:47,840
You are bright as the sun, Lin.

3184
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:49,460
Probably doesn't even know you exist.

3185
02:29:50,980 --> 02:29:51,840
Oh my god.

3186
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:52,340
Wait, no.

3187
02:29:52,840 --> 02:29:56,160
This is like... your streamer doesn't even know you exist.

3188
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:57,880
No!

3189
02:30:02,470 --> 02:30:03,250
One second.

3190
02:30:04,150 --> 02:30:07,770
And those detectives will probably yell at you your whole life.

3191
02:30:08,310 --> 02:30:09,230
Oh my god.

3192
02:30:09,350 --> 02:30:10,470
Getting too real.

3193
02:30:11,150 --> 02:30:13,550
Never mind fretting about every little setback.

3194
02:30:13,710 --> 02:30:14,730
Enjoy your life.

3195
02:30:14,890 --> 02:30:16,310
Get what you can out of it.

3196
02:30:17,570 --> 02:30:18,130
Mister.

3197
02:30:19,570 --> 02:30:22,090
Would you mind just leaving me alone?

3198
02:30:22,830 --> 02:30:23,390
Aww.

3199
02:30:26,610 --> 02:30:27,170
Shoot.

3200
02:30:27,690 --> 02:30:28,250
Sorry.

3201
02:30:28,250 --> 02:30:31,550
I just put some chapstick on.

3202
02:30:32,290 --> 02:30:38,670
But I thought it was emptier than it really was and it just splat all over my lips.

3203
02:30:43,450 --> 02:30:45,210
Now it's all over my finger.

3204
02:30:50,090 --> 02:30:52,450
My lips are gonna be the most hydrated ever.

3205
02:30:53,190 --> 02:30:54,670
Do we even exist-ment?

3206
02:30:55,150 --> 02:30:55,910
Who are you?

3207
02:30:55,990 --> 02:30:56,670
Just kidding.

3208
02:30:58,250 --> 02:30:59,210
Who are you guys?

3209
02:30:59,470 --> 02:31:01,270
Mint doesn't even know who I am.

3210
02:31:01,710 --> 02:31:02,350
Who are you?

3211
02:31:06,340 --> 02:31:06,960
Who are you?

3212
02:31:07,180 --> 02:31:08,600
She forgot about me.

3213
02:31:10,680 --> 02:31:12,560
All I'm thinking about is missile.

3214
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:15,100
I wanna know what's in that book so bad.

3215
02:31:18,040 --> 02:31:19,260
Time to go to the prison.

3216
02:31:21,400 --> 02:31:21,800
Oh.

3217
02:31:22,340 --> 02:31:23,940
We can go to the chicken kitchen.

3218
02:31:24,520 --> 02:31:25,940
No, but we have a job to do.

3219
02:31:27,320 --> 02:31:27,720
Wait.

3220
02:31:28,700 --> 02:31:29,260
Oh, here.

3221
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:29,940
Uniformed.

3222
02:31:29,940 --> 02:31:30,240
No.

3223
02:31:30,360 --> 02:31:30,820
There we go.

3224
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:36,920
Do you think missile will be at the chicken kitchen?

3225
02:31:39,440 --> 02:31:41,000
Mint would never read this.

3226
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:42,300
What did that say?

3227
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:46,780
So how are the preparations coming along?

3228
02:31:47,720 --> 02:31:49,780
I think they're taking care of them right now.

3229
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:51,180
Yeah?

3230
02:31:51,580 --> 02:31:53,740
Man, I'm not looking forward to this.

3231
02:31:55,820 --> 02:31:57,220
That kind of surprises me.

3232
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:58,060
Coming from you.

3233
02:31:58,060 --> 02:32:00,420
I didn't know you thought about such things.

3234
02:32:01,360 --> 02:32:04,560
By the way, that was me being sarcastic.

3235
02:32:04,700 --> 02:32:06,000
Just in case you didn't catch that.

3236
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:09,080
Check the apartment for missile.

3237
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:10,580
No missile left the apartment.

3238
02:32:10,700 --> 02:32:14,400
Missile busted down the door and bolted away, didn't it?

3239
02:32:15,580 --> 02:32:16,580
Two more hours.

3240
02:32:17,420 --> 02:32:18,640
And then it's time.

3241
02:32:20,660 --> 02:32:21,320
Oh my god.

3242
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:24,520
We're gonna go check their jail cell and it's gonna say nothing on their work.

3243
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:25,520
Oh my god.

3244
02:32:25,520 --> 02:32:27,920
It's gonna say, work for tomorrow.

3245
02:32:28,340 --> 02:32:28,820
Death.

3246
02:32:29,540 --> 02:32:30,540
Oh my god!

3247
02:32:34,570 --> 02:32:36,950
I guess we should just get back to work.

3248
02:32:38,510 --> 02:32:39,830
Yeah, I guess you're right.

3249
02:32:41,650 --> 02:32:43,450
Oh my gosh, I don't wanna do death tomorrow.

3250
02:32:47,050 --> 02:32:48,930
The atmosphere sure seems tense.

3251
02:32:50,830 --> 02:32:53,770
I guess I'll just get back to my work as well.

3252
02:32:55,090 --> 02:32:57,310
Find out a certain prisoner's work schedule for tomorrow.

3253
02:32:57,930 --> 02:32:58,590
Blah, blah, blah.

3254
02:32:58,790 --> 02:33:01,630
Each prisoner's schedule for the next day is written on a blackboard in a cell.

3255
02:33:02,890 --> 02:33:03,690
D99, everybody.

3256
02:33:04,470 --> 02:33:05,090
Alrighty then.

3257
02:33:05,170 --> 02:33:06,670
How do I get to these cells?

3258
02:33:07,470 --> 02:33:09,630
I'd better try to get some information here first.

3259
02:33:10,770 --> 02:33:11,570
Trick time!

3260
02:33:13,510 --> 02:33:15,530
We have this memo and this memo.

3261
02:33:17,230 --> 02:33:18,170
And the monitors.

3262
02:33:18,290 --> 02:33:20,950
Maybe now that we know what's going on on the monitor, we can check it.

3263
02:33:21,710 --> 02:33:23,590
Tiny rooms, really small.

3264
02:33:25,110 --> 02:33:25,510
Okay.

3265
02:33:25,610 --> 02:33:26,690
No, we've read that before.

3266
02:33:27,690 --> 02:33:28,770
What's this memo?

3267
02:33:29,850 --> 02:33:31,310
Oh no, not let loose!

3268
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:37,580
I like the way he holds it.

3269
02:33:37,760 --> 02:33:38,360
What is it?

3270
02:33:38,500 --> 02:33:39,460
Hey, Bailey.

3271
02:33:44,390 --> 02:33:47,310
Try pinning up your memos a little better next time.

3272
02:33:48,490 --> 02:33:49,710
Let me see this thing.

3273
02:33:50,210 --> 02:33:52,130
Inspection prisoner C-74.

3274
02:33:53,230 --> 02:33:54,470
Oh, it's almost time for that.

3275
02:33:54,590 --> 02:33:55,310
I'd better prepare.

3276
02:33:56,850 --> 02:33:58,650
Prisoner C-74, eh?

3277
02:33:59,090 --> 02:34:00,750
What did that big whale do?

3278
02:34:03,150 --> 02:34:06,730
I can't believe you could be thrown in jail for a gacha addiction.

3279
02:34:08,430 --> 02:34:09,890
That's kind of messed up.

3280
02:34:11,010 --> 02:34:14,430
You don't know about the Metro Police Department's siege case?

3281
02:34:15,510 --> 02:34:16,510
Metro who what?

3282
02:34:17,270 --> 02:34:22,730
C-74 barricaded himself into the Metro Police Department and took siege of the place.

3283
02:34:22,970 --> 02:34:26,750
He even pointed a huge flamethrower at the chief commissioner.

3284
02:34:27,090 --> 02:34:27,690
Damn!

3285
02:34:29,330 --> 02:34:30,610
C-74!

3286
02:34:32,830 --> 02:34:34,470
Why the heck did he do all that?

3287
02:34:36,910 --> 02:34:39,450
That's what the detectives who surrounded him asked too.

3288
02:34:39,830 --> 02:34:41,650
What are your demands, they asked.

3289
02:34:43,090 --> 02:34:43,570
And...

3290
02:34:43,570 --> 02:34:44,730
Oh my god, he said...

3291
02:34:44,730 --> 02:34:46,230
More free pulls!

3292
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:49,250
The gacha... the rate up is a lie!

3293
02:34:50,770 --> 02:34:54,310
The guy looked confused, thought about it for a while and said...

3294
02:34:54,310 --> 02:34:56,550
Bring me five servings of curry and rice.

3295
02:34:56,790 --> 02:34:57,950
On the double.

3296
02:34:59,110 --> 02:35:00,010
Curry and rice?

3297
02:35:00,190 --> 02:35:00,810
That's it?

3298
02:35:00,990 --> 02:35:01,430
Yeah.

3299
02:35:02,410 --> 02:35:03,030
Unfortunately, no.

3300
02:35:03,290 --> 02:35:07,410
After he was done eating, he torched the commissioner's office with the flamethrower.

3301
02:35:07,810 --> 02:35:08,650
Torched it good.

3302
02:35:09,690 --> 02:35:14,090
Important documents and the commissioner's mustache were destroyed by the flames.

3303
02:35:14,350 --> 02:35:15,730
Not the mustache!

3304
02:35:18,150 --> 02:35:18,630
Comrade!

3305
02:35:19,730 --> 02:35:21,330
What the heck did he do all that for?

3306
02:35:22,590 --> 02:35:25,030
Because the curry was too spicy, he said.

3307
02:35:26,510 --> 02:35:27,470
The Furies.

3308
02:35:27,750 --> 02:35:29,610
This is the Furies' origin story.

3309
02:35:30,390 --> 02:35:33,350
It was too spicy and I just lost it, he said.

3310
02:35:35,470 --> 02:35:36,050
Seriously?

3311
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:39,330
The case sent shockwaves throughout the country.

3312
02:35:39,950 --> 02:35:42,330
But it doesn't make any sense in the first place.

3313
02:35:42,910 --> 02:35:47,810
How did a huge armed guy make it all the way into the commissioner's office alone?

3314
02:35:49,070 --> 02:35:50,650
It's a complete mystery.

3315
02:35:52,670 --> 02:35:53,250
What?

3316
02:35:53,350 --> 02:35:55,390
Why don't they just ask C-74 himself?

3317
02:35:57,430 --> 02:35:59,090
Maybe they did, but they didn't...

3318
02:35:59,090 --> 02:36:00,890
They hadn't released anything about it.

3319
02:36:01,330 --> 02:36:03,150
With his huge arms.

3320
02:36:05,190 --> 02:36:08,270
Apparently, it's all a matter of national secrecy.

3321
02:36:09,110 --> 02:36:09,590
Huh.

3322
02:36:10,830 --> 02:36:11,390
Interesting.

3323
02:36:15,950 --> 02:36:17,830
Why does he do that?

3324
02:36:18,590 --> 02:36:21,030
Why don't you quit throwing my important duty memos away?

3325
02:36:24,610 --> 02:36:25,170
Okay.

3326
02:36:30,300 --> 02:36:32,640
Is he going to put another one up on the board?

3327
02:36:33,300 --> 02:36:34,760
Is this the same one as before?

3328
02:36:36,940 --> 02:36:44,040
I was hoping that I could possess the paper ball when he threw it so I could check the second monitor, but it won't let me.

3329
02:36:45,640 --> 02:36:46,520
Hey, Bailey.

3330
02:36:47,500 --> 02:36:49,160
I think this guy has a southern accent.

3331
02:36:52,120 --> 02:36:52,940
What's the matter?

3332
02:36:53,100 --> 02:36:54,980
You can't even pin up a memo properly?

3333
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:56,620
Let me see this thing.

3334
02:36:56,840 --> 02:36:59,400
Take prisoner C-38 to the telephone room.

3335
02:37:00,200 --> 02:37:02,620
Yes, he just made a request to use the phone a little worse.

3336
02:37:02,620 --> 02:37:03,060
A while ago.

3337
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:05,540
You already told me that earlier.

3338
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:07,140
C-38, eh?

3339
02:37:09,580 --> 02:37:11,460
You can move before you press the bubble.

3340
02:37:12,400 --> 02:37:13,060
Oh, I can?

3341
02:37:16,510 --> 02:37:20,450
In Japan, a death row's inmate execution date is not revealed until the day of.

3342
02:37:20,610 --> 02:37:22,870
I think that's why Lin was asking is tomorrow the day.

3343
02:37:22,990 --> 02:37:23,190
Oh.

3344
02:37:25,010 --> 02:37:26,210
I didn't know that.

3345
02:37:26,670 --> 02:37:27,110
Interesting.

3346
02:37:28,850 --> 02:37:30,270
But see, that's what I think.

3347
02:37:30,310 --> 02:37:31,470
He also was on death row.

3348
02:37:31,550 --> 02:37:32,290
I think so.

3349
02:37:32,290 --> 02:37:32,550
Oh.

3350
02:37:37,710 --> 02:37:39,590
What did that punk do anyway?

3351
02:37:40,170 --> 02:37:43,970
You never heard the story about the secret rendezvous case?

3352
02:37:44,210 --> 02:37:44,730
Ooh la la.

3353
02:37:45,990 --> 02:37:46,810
Secret who what?

3354
02:37:47,610 --> 02:37:49,690
C-38 was a singer in a band.

3355
02:37:50,010 --> 02:37:53,950
His group was playing a concert that was being broadcast all over the country live.

3356
02:37:54,210 --> 02:37:57,750
And right in the middle of their encore, there was a huge incident.

3357
02:37:59,110 --> 02:38:00,270
A huge incident?

3358
02:38:00,490 --> 02:38:01,290
What was it?

3359
02:38:01,350 --> 02:38:02,110
A murder or something?

3360
02:38:03,210 --> 02:38:05,690
In a way, it was even worse than a murder.

3361
02:38:05,850 --> 02:38:08,550
Because it had to do with national secrets.

3362
02:38:08,750 --> 02:38:10,710
Oh my gosh, he said the launch codes in a song.

3363
02:38:14,390 --> 02:38:14,950
25473.

3364
02:38:16,470 --> 02:38:17,030
118.

3365
02:38:17,410 --> 02:38:18,570
Add a 2.

3366
02:38:19,850 --> 02:38:21,130
Square root of 81.

3367
02:38:24,070 --> 02:38:26,170
555 and your mom's birthday.

3368
02:38:26,890 --> 02:38:30,010
That is the launch codes.

3369
02:38:30,010 --> 02:38:32,350
To the missiles.

3370
02:38:32,570 --> 02:38:36,070
And to cause all the doom.

3371
02:38:37,990 --> 02:38:39,470
I'm gonna get thrown in jail.

3372
02:38:41,370 --> 02:38:41,970
Huh?

3373
02:38:45,090 --> 02:38:46,070
National secrets?

3374
02:38:46,330 --> 02:38:47,010
A rock band?

3375
02:38:47,250 --> 02:38:47,910
I'm lost.

3376
02:38:48,330 --> 02:38:49,850
Before the stream cuts out.

3377
02:38:50,990 --> 02:38:52,910
I didn't even say the best part.

3378
02:38:53,510 --> 02:38:54,650
The best part.

3379
02:38:54,770 --> 02:38:55,090
The best part.

3380
02:38:56,730 --> 02:38:59,110
That's the launch codes.

3381
02:38:59,390 --> 02:39:01,390
If you figured it out.

3382
02:39:01,390 --> 02:39:02,750
You're a genius.

3383
02:39:03,250 --> 02:39:06,690
And then you can take over the world.

3384
02:39:06,930 --> 02:39:07,190
Yeah!

3385
02:39:11,950 --> 02:39:12,470
So?

3386
02:39:14,650 --> 02:39:16,390
I gave you the key, everybody.

3387
02:39:16,490 --> 02:39:18,870
You just gotta go and lock the lock.

3388
02:39:22,590 --> 02:39:26,030
The song that they were doing was called Secret Rendezvous.

3389
02:39:27,130 --> 02:39:30,870
But the lyrics CS38 was singing were completely different from usual.

3390
02:39:33,910 --> 02:39:35,510
So how is that a huge incident?

3391
02:39:35,670 --> 02:39:36,890
Oh my god, deep throat.

3392
02:39:37,770 --> 02:39:38,950
Because the new...

3393
02:39:38,950 --> 02:39:39,290
Oh, sorry.

3394
02:39:39,390 --> 02:39:43,910
The new lyrics expose all the nation's dark steamy secrets.

3395
02:39:44,570 --> 02:39:46,250
Does he mean steamy?

3396
02:39:47,650 --> 02:39:48,390
That was clever.

3397
02:39:49,710 --> 02:39:50,270
What?

3398
02:39:50,310 --> 02:39:50,990
The launch code?

3399
02:39:51,210 --> 02:39:51,370
Yeah.

3400
02:39:52,190 --> 02:39:54,170
The last part's a doozy, isn't it?

3401
02:39:55,630 --> 02:39:56,750
Budget misappropriations.

3402
02:39:56,750 --> 02:39:58,230
Foreign economic strategies.

3403
02:39:58,530 --> 02:39:59,630
Illicit dealings.

3404
02:39:59,750 --> 02:40:00,310
Everything.

3405
02:40:02,070 --> 02:40:03,250
See me is a word?

3406
02:40:03,410 --> 02:40:03,830
Oh, it is.

3407
02:40:04,590 --> 02:40:06,410
First Mint blows the whistle on Boeing.

3408
02:40:06,550 --> 02:40:07,970
Then she reveals launch codes.

3409
02:40:08,130 --> 02:40:09,070
She's a rebel.

3410
02:40:10,710 --> 02:40:12,590
Mint played us like a damn fiddle.

3411
02:40:12,630 --> 02:40:13,830
What are you talking about?

3412
02:40:15,630 --> 02:40:18,990
He was caught red-handed in the act of leaking national secrets.

3413
02:40:19,310 --> 02:40:20,850
You are so silly, Peter.

3414
02:40:22,050 --> 02:40:22,990
Thanks for the pink.

3415
02:40:24,610 --> 02:40:25,050
Seriously?

3416
02:40:25,930 --> 02:40:28,130
The case sent shockwaves throughout the country.

3417
02:40:28,630 --> 02:40:30,190
But it doesn't make any sense.

3418
02:40:30,310 --> 02:40:34,430
In the first place, how would a rock singer know any top-secret information?

3419
02:40:35,170 --> 02:40:36,790
It's a complete mis...

3420
02:40:36,790 --> 02:40:38,350
Oh my gosh, there's so many mysteries here.

3421
02:40:38,630 --> 02:40:39,710
Oh my gosh.

3422
02:40:41,470 --> 02:40:41,970
What?

3423
02:40:42,070 --> 02:40:44,350
Why don't they just ask C-38 himself?

3424
02:40:45,090 --> 02:40:48,170
Maybe they did, but they haven't released anything about it.

3425
02:40:48,870 --> 02:40:52,190
Apparently, it's all a matter of national secrecy.

3426
02:40:55,150 --> 02:40:57,150
She's gonna put up more memos though, right?

3427
02:40:57,610 --> 02:40:58,110
Ah!

3428
02:41:01,890 --> 02:41:04,890
Why did you quit throwing my important duty memos away?

3429
02:41:07,070 --> 02:41:07,450
Okay.

3430
02:41:07,510 --> 02:41:10,230
Okay, here's a new one.

3431
02:41:10,270 --> 02:41:10,710
Here's a new one.

3432
02:41:13,210 --> 02:41:13,970
Hey,

3433
02:41:23,830 --> 02:41:24,270
Bailey.

3434
02:41:24,670 --> 02:41:25,770
Okay, here.

3435
02:41:26,530 --> 02:41:27,430
I can ghost.

3436
02:41:30,950 --> 02:41:34,450
I can operate the emergency switch.

3437
02:41:34,970 --> 02:41:36,390
That's pretty impressive.

3438
02:41:38,870 --> 02:41:39,570
Let me see this thing.

3439
02:41:39,650 --> 02:41:41,790
Bring dinner to prisoner D99!

3440
02:41:43,990 --> 02:41:44,650
Uh-oh.

3441
02:41:44,770 --> 02:41:46,230
Is it his final meal?

3442
02:41:49,290 --> 02:41:51,570
The chief is preparing it for him right now.

3443
02:41:51,830 --> 02:41:53,010
Uh-oh, it's his final meal.

3444
02:41:53,690 --> 02:41:55,010
Ooh, how fancy.

3445
02:41:55,230 --> 02:41:56,710
That's why they're preparing it.

3446
02:41:58,070 --> 02:41:58,850
D99, eh?

3447
02:41:59,010 --> 02:42:00,430
Even I know about this one.

3448
02:42:01,250 --> 02:42:01,730
Yeah?

3449
02:42:02,070 --> 02:42:03,250
Such a sad case.

3450
02:42:03,510 --> 02:42:04,370
Hard for us too.

3451
02:42:05,650 --> 02:42:07,390
He shot his wife, didn't he?

3452
02:42:07,390 --> 02:42:09,330
Right in front of a family member.

3453
02:42:11,230 --> 02:42:12,110
The music.

3454
02:42:14,950 --> 02:42:15,890
It's just awful.

3455
02:42:16,070 --> 02:42:17,550
Why in the world did he do it?

3456
02:42:20,570 --> 02:42:22,090
What would be your final meal?

3457
02:42:24,530 --> 02:42:26,610
I don't remember what my final meal was.

3458
02:42:27,850 --> 02:42:30,030
I don't know what I ate last before I died.

3459
02:42:31,530 --> 02:42:32,010
Hmm.

3460
02:42:34,070 --> 02:42:36,570
Maybe like, um, omurice or something.

3461
02:42:38,610 --> 02:42:41,970
Why would he do something like that, of all people?

3462
02:42:42,930 --> 02:42:43,950
The mode of everything?

3463
02:42:44,750 --> 02:42:46,670
God, these detectives suck.

3464
02:42:46,730 --> 02:42:47,610
They can't figure out anything.

3465
02:42:48,150 --> 02:42:49,370
Everything's a complete mystery.

3466
02:42:51,050 --> 02:42:52,090
It's just ridiculous.

3467
02:42:52,470 --> 02:42:54,810
It doesn't make sense that you would do anything like that.

3468
02:42:56,370 --> 02:43:02,070
I don't know the details, but apparently this case is a matter of national secrecy as well.

3469
02:43:03,330 --> 02:43:04,470
I don't get it.

3470
02:43:04,470 --> 02:43:06,110
None of it makes any sense.

3471
02:43:07,410 --> 02:43:10,230
You do know what kind of prison this is, don't you?

3472
02:43:11,330 --> 02:43:11,890
No?

3473
02:43:12,750 --> 02:43:17,350
It's a special prison built for these kinds of special cases.

3474
02:43:17,790 --> 02:43:18,950
That D99.

3475
02:43:19,230 --> 02:43:23,610
Who knows what he's thinking or hiding behind that beard of his.

3476
02:43:25,210 --> 02:43:26,950
I don't like any of it.

3477
02:43:27,510 --> 02:43:30,710
I had my money on the exploding pies from Spongebob.

3478
02:43:32,050 --> 02:43:35,550
I knew I couldn't take my job seriously without it getting to me.

3479
02:43:36,570 --> 02:43:39,770
So the prisoner I'm looking for, D99, was convicted of murder.

3480
02:43:40,590 --> 02:43:41,110
Murder.

3481
02:43:41,790 --> 02:43:43,570
And he apparently has a beard.

3482
02:43:44,090 --> 02:43:44,950
Oh my god.

3483
02:43:51,290 --> 02:43:54,690
Would you quit throwing away my duty memos?

3484
02:44:00,550 --> 02:44:01,070
Alright.

3485
02:44:03,330 --> 02:44:04,090
It's time.

3486
02:44:04,090 --> 02:44:04,210
Hi.

3487
02:44:07,410 --> 02:44:09,630
Wait, I've heard that sound before.

3488
02:44:11,990 --> 02:44:13,370
Oh, it's the rock star.

3489
02:44:15,150 --> 02:44:16,010
Oh my god.

3490
02:44:17,250 --> 02:44:20,350
Why do they allow him to have a guitar in prison?

3491
02:44:23,450 --> 02:44:24,410
It's a stalk sound?

3492
02:44:24,650 --> 02:44:24,850
Okay.

3493
02:44:24,970 --> 02:44:28,070
I'm like, where have I heard that sound, that door sound before?

3494
02:44:29,930 --> 02:44:31,730
Oh, he finished putting up the thing.

3495
02:44:32,670 --> 02:44:33,310
It's done.

3496
02:44:35,450 --> 02:44:36,190
Uh, emergency!

3497
02:44:39,970 --> 02:44:41,310
Oh, that's a lot of guns.

3498
02:44:41,490 --> 02:44:42,210
Oh my god.

3499
02:44:42,310 --> 02:44:43,230
Wait, is that like a...

3500
02:44:43,750 --> 02:44:45,050
Is that like a grenade launcher?

3501
02:44:45,410 --> 02:44:47,470
There you go again, fooling around with that thing.

3502
02:44:49,990 --> 02:44:50,790
A bazooka?

3503
02:44:52,190 --> 02:44:53,010
It wasn't me.

3504
02:44:54,310 --> 02:44:54,950
Don't lie.

3505
02:44:55,110 --> 02:44:58,090
Oh no, you love to see me jump and prepare for emergency.

3506
02:44:59,030 --> 02:45:00,010
Oh yeah, sure.

3507
02:45:00,130 --> 02:45:01,990
Way back when I first got this job.

3508
02:45:02,670 --> 02:45:04,250
But I've had enough of that now.

3509
02:45:04,250 --> 02:45:06,670
Besides, you always react exactly the same.

3510
02:45:09,510 --> 02:45:11,830
The emergency switch is probably just loose.

3511
02:45:12,030 --> 02:45:14,230
Probably because I fooled around with it too much.

3512
02:45:15,550 --> 02:45:16,790
Well, it's for emergencies.

3513
02:45:17,130 --> 02:45:18,250
Don't play with it.

3514
02:45:19,350 --> 02:45:20,610
Anyway, it wasn't me.

3515
02:45:20,910 --> 02:45:22,950
Maybe you ought to get it repaired, huh?

3516
02:45:23,310 --> 02:45:24,030
Dang, I'm back!

3517
02:45:24,690 --> 02:45:26,210
I'm so sorry, you guys.

3518
02:45:27,850 --> 02:45:32,190
For anyone watching the VOD, um, we just had a bit of a hiccup here.

3519
02:45:34,850 --> 02:45:35,650
We're back!

3520
02:45:35,830 --> 02:45:37,290
Hopefully, we're good.

3521
02:45:39,170 --> 02:45:43,290
I just, I just stopped on the night vision goggles and I laughed about it.

3522
02:45:43,390 --> 02:45:45,470
And then, and then OBS crashed.

3523
02:45:49,250 --> 02:45:52,050
It was the night vision goggles' fault.

3524
02:45:55,030 --> 02:45:58,190
I was like, I was like, no way.

3525
02:45:58,270 --> 02:45:59,590
Night vision goggles.

3526
02:45:59,790 --> 02:46:00,830
Oh, it is a bazooka.

3527
02:46:01,330 --> 02:46:02,830
More night vision goggles.

3528
02:46:03,490 --> 02:46:04,930
Oh wait, we can check the...

3529
02:46:06,070 --> 02:46:06,470
Um...

3530
02:46:06,990 --> 02:46:08,390
Okay, anyway, back to business.

3531
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:12,930
Okay, we can't check that monitor, but can we...

3532
02:46:12,930 --> 02:46:14,610
Oh, we still can't reach that one either.

3533
02:46:17,250 --> 02:46:19,030
Can I operate the bazooka?

3534
02:46:19,190 --> 02:46:19,590
No.

3535
02:46:24,870 --> 02:46:26,010
Yeah, sorry about that, guys.

3536
02:46:29,450 --> 02:46:30,510
Oh, I can go here.

3537
02:46:31,010 --> 02:46:31,410
Camera.

3538
02:46:31,410 --> 02:46:31,510
Camera.

3539
02:46:32,270 --> 02:46:32,670
Button.

3540
02:46:33,410 --> 02:46:33,810
Door.

3541
02:46:36,410 --> 02:46:37,350
Let's try pressing this.

3542
02:46:39,230 --> 02:46:39,630
Nala!

3543
02:46:40,810 --> 02:46:41,210
Oh

3544
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:47,700
wow, that's very tricky timing.

3545
02:46:47,860 --> 02:46:48,260
Okay, okay.

3546
02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:50,640
Press!

3547
02:46:51,100 --> 02:46:51,820
Okay, there we go.

3548
02:46:54,440 --> 02:46:55,100
There we go.

3549
02:46:55,480 --> 02:46:55,880
Nice.

3550
02:47:00,630 --> 02:47:03,410
So this is the thing that was making that horrible noise a second ago.

3551
02:47:04,870 --> 02:47:05,630
Am I still...

3552
02:47:05,630 --> 02:47:06,410
Am I back, you guys?

3553
02:47:06,410 --> 02:47:06,930
I can't tell.

3554
02:47:08,370 --> 02:47:09,430
Refresh if you're having issues.

3555
02:47:16,310 --> 02:47:17,590
I can't tell if I'm back.

3556
02:47:17,650 --> 02:47:18,690
I think my chat is dead.

3557
02:47:18,850 --> 02:47:19,530
Hold on, screen.

3558
02:47:24,850 --> 02:47:26,450
I think it's because...

3559
02:47:30,830 --> 02:47:33,230
Oh no, chat is all messed up on screen.

3560
02:47:34,110 --> 02:47:34,770
Oh, there it is.

3561
02:47:38,420 --> 02:47:43,780
I think OBS crashes when it doesn't get a good connection to...

3562
02:47:46,420 --> 02:47:47,220
To YouTube.

3563
02:47:49,900 --> 02:47:52,120
It should have given us the launch codes.

3564
02:47:52,440 --> 02:47:54,160
Yeah, you're so right.

3565
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:57,840
I think maybe I jinxed myself by stopping my own stream earlier.

3566
02:47:58,820 --> 02:48:01,720
I mean, I didn't do anything of the sort.

3567
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:03,740
Wait, how long have I been streaming?

3568
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:04,780
Okay, almost 3 hours.

3569
02:48:05,140 --> 02:48:06,320
I wanted to go longer.

3570
02:48:06,400 --> 02:48:08,040
I'm just nervous about...

3571
02:48:08,480 --> 02:48:09,920
Let's just go a little bit longer.

3572
02:48:11,140 --> 02:48:12,840
Because I wanted to play so much today.

3573
02:48:12,920 --> 02:48:14,220
I want it to go longer today.

3574
02:48:15,440 --> 02:48:21,140
We'll see how if it if it acts up again but since it like disconnected earlier too I'm just kind of nervous.

3575
02:48:21,960 --> 02:48:25,600
I guess it's a way for this spiky-haired youth to express himself.

3576
02:48:26,180 --> 02:48:29,100
Sentiments like I'm hungry or I'm thirsty maybe.

3577
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:32,660
Something primitive like that I bet.

3578
02:48:36,170 --> 02:48:37,050
Peace out!

3579
02:48:38,350 --> 02:48:39,110
I'm done!

3580
02:48:45,870 --> 02:48:48,050
Alright C38, back to your cell.

3581
02:48:49,070 --> 02:48:52,030
Hey guard man, how about giving me a little space?

3582
02:48:52,810 --> 02:48:57,150
That crazy walk of yours is doing... yours is dangerous man.

3583
02:48:58,710 --> 02:49:01,270
A proper walk for a properly led life.

3584
02:49:01,470 --> 02:49:02,290
Now let's go.

3585
02:49:03,450 --> 02:49:05,090
Yo, no lectures man.

3586
02:49:05,250 --> 02:49:06,430
I walk my own path.

3587
02:49:06,490 --> 02:49:08,110
My own way to my own music.

3588
02:49:09,970 --> 02:49:11,450
I'm going to blame the Patriots.

3589
02:49:11,610 --> 02:49:12,350
Me too.

3590
02:49:15,970 --> 02:49:19,350
And we're inside the guitar so we get to go into the jail cell.

3591
02:49:24,560 --> 02:49:25,300
Where's our beard?

3592
02:49:27,340 --> 02:49:28,440
Oh that guy has a beard.

3593
02:49:30,260 --> 02:49:32,900
I can't tell if that guy has a beard.

3594
02:49:33,640 --> 02:49:35,320
So I finally made it to the cells.

3595
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:39,240
Now to find prisoner D99 and check out his work schedule for tomorrow.

3596
02:49:39,700 --> 02:49:41,840
What could Lin possibly want with that information?

3597
02:49:42,520 --> 02:49:43,920
This game is the GOAT.

3598
02:49:44,040 --> 02:49:45,600
Watching a blind playthrough is a lot of fun.

3599
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:47,500
I wish I can re-experience it for the first time again.

3600
02:49:47,500 --> 02:49:48,120
Hope you enjoy.

3601
02:49:49,400 --> 02:49:50,160
Thank you.

3602
02:49:51,020 --> 02:49:54,300
I always feel that was like I of course feel that way with Metal Gear.

3603
02:49:55,780 --> 02:49:58,680
But it's like at the same time I'm so glad that I played it.

3604
02:49:58,760 --> 02:50:02,340
If I had never played it then I would never have experienced it once to begin with.

3605
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:12,320
Don't think I can take another second in this stinking pit.

3606
02:50:13,240 --> 02:50:15,920
Dang he has all his instruments and everything.

3607
02:50:17,020 --> 02:50:18,580
Looks like the guard man is gone.

3608
02:50:28,710 --> 02:50:30,510
All this weight in his hands is wiping me out.

3609
02:50:30,650 --> 02:50:32,770
Hope this one will finally do it.

3610
02:50:36,110 --> 02:50:40,650
Oh my god he's sending the launch codes through code.

3611
02:50:42,290 --> 02:50:43,690
Come on sausage head.

3612
02:50:48,390 --> 02:50:48,870
What?

3613
02:50:48,870 --> 02:50:49,350
What?

3614
02:50:50,470 --> 02:50:51,910
This is a lenient prison.

3615
02:50:52,050 --> 02:50:52,430
For real.

3616
02:50:52,550 --> 02:50:54,510
I was just thinking like they allow basketballs.

3617
02:50:54,510 --> 02:50:58,090
They allow... like this guitar is so spiky it should be considered a weapon.

3618
02:50:59,110 --> 02:50:59,730
That's pretty cool.

3619
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3620
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3621
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3622
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3623
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3624
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3625
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3626
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3627
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3628
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3629
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3630
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3631
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3632
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3633
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3634
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3635
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3636
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3637
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3638
02:50:59,730 --> 02:50:59,730
I love it.

3639
02:51:08,270 --> 02:51:10,790
I love it.

3640
02:51:14,850 --> 02:51:16,030
I love it.

3641
02:51:16,170 --> 02:51:16,450
I love it.

3642
02:51:17,750 --> 02:51:18,390
I love it.

3643
02:51:19,130 --> 02:51:19,230
I love it.

3644
02:51:19,350 --> 02:51:19,930
I love it.

3645
02:51:19,930 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3646
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3647
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3648
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3649
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3650
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3651
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3652
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3653
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3654
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3655
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3656
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3657
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3658
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,090
I love it.

3659
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,230
I love it.

3660
02:51:20,230 --> 02:51:20,230
I love it.

3661
02:51:20,230 --> 02:51:20,230
I love it.

3662
02:51:20,230 --> 02:51:20,230
I love it.

3663
02:51:20,230 --> 02:51:20,230
I love it.

3664
02:51:20,230 --> 02:51:20,230
I love it.

3665
02:51:20,230 --> 02:51:20,230
I love it.

3666
02:51:20,230 --> 02:51:20,230
I love it.

3667
02:51:20,230 --> 02:51:20,230
I love it.

3668
02:51:20,230 --> 02:51:20,250
I love it.

3669
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:20,250
I love it.

3670
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:20,250
I love it.

3671
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:20,250
I love it.

3672
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:20,250
I love it.

3673
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:20,250
I love it.

3674
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:20,250
I love it.

3675
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:20,250
I love it.

3676
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:20,250
I love it.

3677
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:20,550
I love it.

3678
02:51:20,550 --> 02:51:21,190
I love it.

3679
02:51:21,190 --> 02:51:21,950
I love it.

3680
02:51:22,470 --> 02:51:23,070
I love it.

3681
02:51:23,070 --> 02:51:23,370
I love it.

3682
02:51:23,430 --> 02:51:23,830
I love it.

3683
02:51:23,950 --> 02:51:24,430
I love it.

3684
02:51:24,430 --> 02:51:24,430
I love it.

3685
02:51:24,430 --> 02:51:24,430
I love it.

3686
02:51:24,430 --> 02:51:24,430
I love it.

3687
02:51:24,430 --> 02:51:24,430
I love it.

3688
02:51:24,430 --> 02:51:24,430
I love it.

3689
02:51:24,430 --> 02:51:24,430
I love it.

3690
02:51:24,430 --> 02:51:24,430
I love it.

3691
02:51:24,430 --> 02:51:24,730
I love it.

3692
02:51:25,150 --> 02:51:25,750
I love it.

3693
02:51:26,310 --> 02:51:27,810
I love it.

3694
02:51:29,150 --> 02:51:30,570
I I can't read!

3695
02:51:31,410 --> 02:51:34,610
Oh God, I can't read!

3696
02:51:34,970 --> 02:51:36,710
Oh God, I can't read!

3697
02:51:41,590 --> 02:51:43,970
I can see that there's some kind of...

3698
02:51:45,820 --> 02:51:47,960
But I have absolutely no idea what it means.

3699
02:51:48,100 --> 02:51:49,360
I can't read.

3700
02:51:51,360 --> 02:51:56,200
If I can't read Prisoner D99's work schedule for tomorrow, what do I do now?

3701
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:01,560
What

3702
02:52:06,480 --> 02:52:07,240
is this?

3703
02:52:07,380 --> 02:52:08,260
Oh, this telephone.

3704
02:52:08,260 --> 02:52:10,220
Looks like it's an internal line only.

3705
02:52:10,380 --> 02:52:12,140
It doesn't call outside the prison.

3706
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:14,960
So the only places I can go with this telephone are...

3707
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:17,800
Other phones within the building that I've already possessed.

3708
02:52:18,120 --> 02:52:18,760
Oh, nice though.

3709
02:52:21,320 --> 02:52:22,580
I can't read.

3710
02:52:23,800 --> 02:52:25,420
Oh my gosh, I can't read.

3711
02:52:27,620 --> 02:52:28,500
Empty prison.

3712
02:52:38,090 --> 02:52:40,910
Looks like there's... I can't tell if the line going down...

3713
02:52:40,910 --> 02:52:42,290
What if I just press the emergency button?

3714
02:52:43,450 --> 02:52:44,590
An emergency button.

3715
02:52:44,710 --> 02:52:45,470
An emergency button.

3716
02:52:45,490 --> 02:52:46,310
In a prison.

3717
02:52:46,510 --> 02:52:47,850
That's gotta be a pretty bad situation.

3718
02:52:48,730 --> 02:52:49,810
I'll give it a little try.

3719
02:52:50,270 --> 02:52:51,470
Time to cause chaos.

3720
02:52:57,670 --> 02:52:58,270
Uh oh.

3721
02:52:58,370 --> 02:52:59,830
Oh, he just told him, no, no, no!

3722
02:53:03,890 --> 02:53:04,930
Where do I...

3723
02:53:05,650 --> 02:53:06,430
Go from here?

3724
02:53:08,890 --> 02:53:12,290
I think I have to cause that and then go through the note, maybe?

3725
02:53:14,310 --> 02:53:14,710
Hmm...

3726
02:53:25,560 --> 02:53:26,200
What is this?

3727
02:53:26,480 --> 02:53:27,480
Oh, I can play the drum!

3728
02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:31,520
Hey, quit that racket!

3729
02:53:33,300 --> 02:53:35,940
This music almost sounds like Pokemon, like...

3730
02:53:36,780 --> 02:53:38,020
Battle music, doesn't it?

3731
02:53:39,140 --> 02:53:41,620
Oh wait, I think through here I can see what's going on.

3732
02:53:42,320 --> 02:53:43,720
It won't let me move around.

3733
02:53:44,360 --> 02:53:45,200
That's kinda weird.

3734
02:53:45,560 --> 02:53:47,600
It really lets me see what's going on on the screen.

3735
02:53:48,700 --> 02:53:51,020
But I'm trying to move and it won't let me move.

3736
02:53:57,240 --> 02:53:57,720
Oh!

3737
02:53:58,300 --> 02:53:59,260
They moved him!

3738
02:53:59,760 --> 02:54:00,240
Oh!

3739
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:01,520
Wait a second.

3740
02:54:02,600 --> 02:54:03,520
Wait a second.

3741
02:54:05,940 --> 02:54:06,420
Oh...

3742
02:54:06,420 --> 02:54:08,720
Well, that's not our guy anyway, right?

3743
02:54:11,840 --> 02:54:13,780
Oh, and also this counts as a cutscene.

3744
02:54:14,700 --> 02:54:15,640
Go, go, go!

3745
02:54:23,870 --> 02:54:24,670
What's going on?

3746
02:54:27,750 --> 02:54:29,130
Does this count as a beard?

3747
02:54:30,850 --> 02:54:32,010
This guy has a beard?

3748
02:54:32,770 --> 02:54:34,010
Both of them have a beard.

3749
02:54:36,290 --> 02:54:37,830
Why is this guy a baby?

3750
02:54:37,990 --> 02:54:40,210
Why does this guy have the large...

3751
02:54:40,210 --> 02:54:40,930
What is this guy?

3752
02:54:46,040 --> 02:54:46,520
Ooh!

3753
02:54:55,750 --> 02:54:57,430
His head is so wobbly.

3754
02:54:57,810 --> 02:54:58,710
I don't think I...

3755
02:54:59,590 --> 02:55:00,410
Oh my god!

3756
02:55:01,030 --> 02:55:01,770
Prison break!

3757
02:55:03,410 --> 02:55:04,010
This guy

3758
02:55:09,320 --> 02:55:12,340
was accidentally attached to the thing and I didn't realize.

3759
02:55:13,020 --> 02:55:14,220
By the looks of him...

3760
02:55:14,220 --> 02:55:17,220
That must be the curry lover from the police department's siege case.

3761
02:55:17,460 --> 02:55:18,380
But never mind that.

3762
02:55:18,440 --> 02:55:19,160
Where did he go?

3763
02:55:20,180 --> 02:55:21,860
What is going on in this cell?

3764
02:55:22,400 --> 02:55:24,340
There's a little blackboard here too.

3765
02:55:25,220 --> 02:55:26,260
Just to be safe.

3766
02:55:26,340 --> 02:55:29,060
Maybe I'd better check the curry lover's schedule for tomorrow too.

3767
02:55:29,700 --> 02:55:30,840
But I can't read.

3768
02:55:35,400 --> 02:55:36,940
You solved it by accident?

3769
02:55:37,120 --> 02:55:39,500
Well, I knew what I had to do but I didn't realize I was...

3770
02:55:40,340 --> 02:55:42,440
I didn't realize I was...

3771
02:55:44,180 --> 02:55:46,120
Possessing the note.

3772
02:55:47,660 --> 02:55:49,060
I still can't read.

3773
02:55:49,400 --> 02:55:52,120
But I'd better go check out prisoner D99's cell anyway.

3774
02:55:52,400 --> 02:55:54,960
Maybe I can find some kind of information that might help Lin out.

3775
02:55:55,520 --> 02:55:59,320
Besides, I want to see what this prisoner Lin is investigating looks like.

3776
02:56:00,680 --> 02:56:01,180
Okay.

3777
02:56:02,420 --> 02:56:04,020
Oh, I can't get over there.

3778
02:56:04,160 --> 02:56:04,460
Uh oh.

3779
02:56:07,400 --> 02:56:08,180
Ring-a-ling!

3780
02:56:08,820 --> 02:56:09,820
Come back mister!

3781
02:56:12,440 --> 02:56:12,940
Come back!

3782
02:56:13,060 --> 02:56:13,420
Come back!

3783
02:56:17,500 --> 02:56:18,380
His spoon.

3784
02:56:19,660 --> 02:56:20,100
Phew!

3785
02:56:20,500 --> 02:56:21,200
Oh, nice.

3786
02:56:21,320 --> 02:56:22,060
Thank you, sir.

3787
02:56:28,050 --> 02:56:28,950
Same thing here.

3788
02:56:31,030 --> 02:56:32,310
It doesn't call outside.

3789
02:56:33,550 --> 02:56:35,510
Other phones within the building that I've already possessed.

3790
02:56:35,630 --> 02:56:37,410
Well, we've possessed this one now, so we're good.

3791
02:56:41,340 --> 02:56:42,260
Okay, here we are.

3792
02:56:44,040 --> 02:56:45,460
Oh, he's an artiste.

3793
02:56:47,260 --> 02:56:47,900
Oh, hmm.

3794
02:56:49,500 --> 02:56:50,360
With a...

3795
02:56:50,360 --> 02:56:51,640
What is that on the wall?

3796
02:56:52,520 --> 02:56:53,700
What a strange cell.

3797
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:56,660
And the prisoner inside it...

3798
02:56:57,580 --> 02:56:59,480
He seems to be enjoying himself.

3799
02:57:01,620 --> 02:57:03,600
Sorry, I'm invading your private time.

3800
02:57:03,900 --> 02:57:05,560
This is the last cell in this area.

3801
02:57:06,020 --> 02:57:10,140
So that means that this man humming to himself must be prisoner D99.

3802
02:57:11,300 --> 02:57:13,060
According to what the guards say.

3803
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:16,700
Oh, yeah.

3804
02:57:16,820 --> 02:57:17,380
Recap.

3805
02:57:17,380 --> 02:57:19,920
He shot his wife in front of a family member.

3806
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:25,360
What in the world really happened?

3807
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:30,420
And why is Lin so concerned about this prisoner?

3808
02:57:31,880 --> 02:57:34,760
I don't know the answers and I guess there's no need for me to know.

3809
02:57:38,240 --> 02:57:40,060
I have only one objective.

3810
02:57:41,440 --> 02:57:45,280
And that's to find out what this painter's work schedule is for tomorrow.

3811
02:57:49,730 --> 02:57:50,790
Trick time!

3812
02:57:53,390 --> 02:57:54,350
Picture frame.

3813
02:57:54,830 --> 02:57:55,750
Okay, open that up.

3814
02:57:56,850 --> 02:57:57,450
Ooh.

3815
02:57:58,790 --> 02:57:59,390
What's it?

3816
02:57:59,590 --> 02:58:01,970
I wonder if these are his family.

3817
02:58:02,230 --> 02:58:03,630
Oh my gosh, that's kind of gruesome though.

3818
02:58:03,870 --> 02:58:04,550
Oh my god.

3819
02:58:04,890 --> 02:58:06,890
It's my wife and a giraffe.

3820
02:58:07,990 --> 02:58:08,950
My children.

3821
02:58:09,110 --> 02:58:10,910
My child is a giraffe.

3822
02:58:12,330 --> 02:58:14,610
Why is the left picture a giraffe?

3823
02:58:15,270 --> 02:58:15,870
Hahaha.

3824
02:58:15,870 --> 02:58:16,230
Hahaha.

3825
02:58:17,850 --> 02:58:18,830
Oh my god.

3826
02:58:21,210 --> 02:58:22,990
I wonder if these are of his family.

3827
02:58:23,430 --> 02:58:25,810
This one looks like a young woman holding a baby.

3828
02:58:30,090 --> 02:58:30,570
You

3829
02:58:57,180 --> 02:58:59,040
guys see the giraffe?

3830
02:58:59,660 --> 02:59:02,040
You guys see the giraffe, right?

3831
02:59:06,080 --> 02:59:07,020
Oh, I know.

3832
02:59:08,720 --> 02:59:09,980
Oh, I can see it?

3833
02:59:10,020 --> 02:59:10,200
Okay.

3834
02:59:13,260 --> 02:59:13,820
Ooh.

3835
02:59:15,340 --> 02:59:18,460
Their faces have been blotted out with black paint.

3836
02:59:19,080 --> 02:59:21,820
Oh, so the baby is definitely Lin, right?

3837
02:59:22,320 --> 02:59:24,820
Did he do it out of hatred or some other emotion?

3838
02:59:25,480 --> 02:59:28,000
Thankfully, that's not something I need to know right now.

3839
02:59:28,820 --> 02:59:33,320
She definitely became a detective to figure out her dad's situation.

3840
02:59:36,160 --> 02:59:38,680
A newspaper article has been cut out and framed.

3841
02:59:41,540 --> 02:59:42,900
Unfortunately, I can't read it.

3842
02:59:43,440 --> 02:59:43,460
Hahaha.

3843
02:59:44,060 --> 02:59:45,020
I'm stupid.

3844
02:59:45,140 --> 02:59:45,740
I'm dumb.

3845
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:46,620
I'm so dumb.

3846
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:48,820
It's probably about D99's case.

3847
02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:50,900
Man murders wife or something like that.

3848
02:59:51,140 --> 02:59:52,740
Why would you frame that though?

3849
02:59:53,680 --> 02:59:55,900
There's a picture of the alleged culprit in the article.

3850
02:59:56,440 --> 02:59:56,920
Yep.

3851
02:59:57,080 --> 02:59:58,140
It's this prisoner.

3852
02:59:58,200 --> 02:59:58,560
All right.

3853
03:00:04,550 --> 03:00:05,030
Okay.

3854
03:00:05,130 --> 03:00:05,790
Moment of truth.

3855
03:00:05,930 --> 03:00:09,090
The work schedule for tomorrow of prisoner D99.

3856
03:00:09,370 --> 03:00:10,270
It's going to be...

3857
03:00:10,270 --> 03:00:10,570
Okay.

3858
03:00:10,910 --> 03:00:12,330
The reason we don't need this article is because...

3859
03:00:12,330 --> 03:00:14,370
We don't need to know how to read is because it's going to be empty.

3860
03:00:14,710 --> 03:00:15,510
Oh my gosh.

3861
03:00:16,830 --> 03:00:19,090
If we don't need to know, it's going to be empty.

3862
03:00:19,250 --> 03:00:20,070
Oh my gosh.

3863
03:00:20,090 --> 03:00:20,710
Oh my gosh.

3864
03:00:20,730 --> 03:00:21,470
It's going to be empty.

3865
03:00:24,530 --> 03:00:27,650
The information Lin's been looking for should be written on this blackboard.

3866
03:00:28,530 --> 03:00:30,290
Unfortunately, I've lost the ability to read.

3867
03:00:31,170 --> 03:00:32,290
But here I am anyway.

3868
03:00:32,530 --> 03:00:33,930
The least I can do is take a look.

3869
03:00:36,670 --> 03:00:37,070
Huh?

3870
03:00:37,590 --> 03:00:38,630
What could this mean?

3871
03:00:40,010 --> 03:00:41,970
There's nothing written on the board.

3872
03:00:42,330 --> 03:00:43,090
Oh no.

3873
03:00:44,850 --> 03:00:46,150
Oh my God.

3874
03:00:47,070 --> 03:00:48,010
No work tomorrow.

3875
03:00:48,070 --> 03:00:48,750
Oh gosh.

3876
03:00:48,850 --> 03:00:49,890
He has death tomorrow.

3877
03:00:51,070 --> 03:00:53,070
I think something was written on the blackboard.

3878
03:00:53,190 --> 03:00:56,630
I think something was written on the blackboards of the other prisoners.

3879
03:00:56,990 --> 03:01:01,390
But this blackboard is as clean and blank as the day it was hung there.

3880
03:01:02,870 --> 03:01:04,170
I knew it.

3881
03:01:04,330 --> 03:01:05,510
I knew it.

3882
03:01:07,230 --> 03:01:09,330
So I have the answer Lin was looking for.

3883
03:01:09,770 --> 03:01:12,190
Tomorrow's work schedule for prisoner D99.

3884
03:01:12,330 --> 03:01:12,950
D99 is...

3885
03:01:13,730 --> 03:01:14,170
Nothing.

3886
03:01:17,790 --> 03:01:19,970
Would this information mean anything to her?

3887
03:01:20,190 --> 03:01:21,930
It's not up to me to know or care.

3888
03:01:22,310 --> 03:01:24,030
That's how I feel at the moment anyway.

3889
03:01:24,710 --> 03:01:26,870
And then they're cooking his final meal.

3890
03:01:28,110 --> 03:01:28,910
I'm jealous.

3891
03:01:31,530 --> 03:01:32,590
Oh my gosh.

3892
03:01:33,030 --> 03:01:33,470
Mister.

3893
03:01:34,970 --> 03:01:36,090
Not being able to read.

3894
03:01:36,130 --> 03:01:37,710
I was wondering how this was going to turn out.

3895
03:01:37,990 --> 03:01:40,970
Some things in this world can be read even if no one can...

3896
03:01:40,970 --> 03:01:43,190
Even if one can't read.

3897
03:01:43,430 --> 03:01:44,790
No one can read.

3898
03:01:46,310 --> 03:01:49,090
Prisoner D99's work schedule for tomorrow is blank.

3899
03:01:51,070 --> 03:01:53,990
I'd better get this important information to Lin as fast as I can.

3900
03:02:02,920 --> 03:02:03,560
Close.

3901
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:04,720
Dinner.

3902
03:02:11,150 --> 03:02:13,250
Quite a feast tonight I see.

3903
03:02:13,530 --> 03:02:14,330
He's huge.

3904
03:02:14,550 --> 03:02:16,890
He's the literal chat meme.

3905
03:02:16,950 --> 03:02:17,710
This guy.

3906
03:02:18,310 --> 03:02:19,450
Oh my gosh.

3907
03:02:19,450 --> 03:02:22,370
This guy is the chat meme.

3908
03:02:25,490 --> 03:02:26,530
He's huge.

3909
03:02:26,790 --> 03:02:28,170
He cuts out of the frame.

3910
03:02:31,050 --> 03:02:33,670
And I'm absolutely crazy about this chicken.

3911
03:02:33,970 --> 03:02:35,030
Oh, he's smiling.

3912
03:02:37,450 --> 03:02:39,790
It's too bad it's all cold and hard though.

3913
03:02:40,990 --> 03:02:45,230
I'd say it's been about two hours since it was cooked, judging from the way it feels.

3914
03:02:48,030 --> 03:02:48,590
D99?

3915
03:02:48,870 --> 03:02:49,430
D99?

3916
03:02:49,450 --> 03:02:51,630
I know it's kind of pointless to ask now.

3917
03:02:52,150 --> 03:02:53,390
But just the same.

3918
03:02:54,410 --> 03:02:55,650
I still want to know.

3919
03:02:56,690 --> 03:02:58,290
Why did you do it?

3920
03:03:03,480 --> 03:03:06,520
I agree, it's pointless to ask now.

3921
03:03:08,580 --> 03:03:13,180
My case is colder than this chicken and has been forgotten by everybody.

3922
03:03:15,300 --> 03:03:16,340
Myself included.

3923
03:03:18,660 --> 03:03:19,860
Detective Zhao?

3924
03:03:20,100 --> 03:03:21,320
He was a detective!

3925
03:03:22,120 --> 03:03:22,720
I'm sorry.

3926
03:03:22,720 --> 03:03:26,820
Now then, let me eat in peace before it gets too cold to cut.

3927
03:03:28,040 --> 03:03:30,800
Why did they take so long to serve him his dinner?

3928
03:03:36,410 --> 03:03:38,070
Oh, that is art.

3929
03:03:38,910 --> 03:03:41,470
There's one more thing I've been wondering for a long time.

3930
03:03:43,790 --> 03:03:44,410
What's that?

3931
03:03:44,650 --> 03:03:45,510
Is it about Lin?

3932
03:03:46,010 --> 03:03:46,790
Your daughter?

3933
03:03:47,090 --> 03:03:49,230
Oh, who was the man in that painting?

3934
03:03:52,250 --> 03:03:53,010
Oh, this?

3935
03:03:53,570 --> 03:03:54,510
It's the culprit.

3936
03:03:54,810 --> 03:03:55,310
Oh, this?

3937
03:03:56,890 --> 03:04:00,170
Well, being in prison like this, you start to forget faces, you know?

3938
03:04:00,790 --> 03:04:03,730
So I paint the faces that I don't want to forget.

3939
03:04:05,690 --> 03:04:08,010
And this is the last of those faces.

3940
03:04:15,290 --> 03:04:17,630
Could you leave me alone for a bit?

3941
03:04:18,230 --> 03:04:18,710
Wait!

3942
03:04:20,950 --> 03:04:21,430
What?

3943
03:04:21,930 --> 03:04:22,630
It's me!

3944
03:04:26,350 --> 03:04:27,830
Let a man eat.

3945
03:04:27,850 --> 03:04:28,330
Eat in peace.

3946
03:04:30,410 --> 03:04:31,190
Okay, sure.

3947
03:04:31,370 --> 03:04:32,570
Sorry to bother you.

3948
03:04:33,490 --> 03:04:34,610
We must have...

3949
03:04:34,610 --> 03:04:36,270
Did we work together?

3950
03:04:36,510 --> 03:04:37,470
What's going on?

3951
03:04:37,550 --> 03:04:37,770
Wait.

3952
03:04:38,210 --> 03:04:39,990
Our hair is so similar.

3953
03:04:40,370 --> 03:04:41,270
I don't know.

3954
03:04:41,290 --> 03:04:41,950
Are we brothers?

3955
03:04:42,930 --> 03:04:43,990
What's going on?

3956
03:04:49,610 --> 03:04:50,130
Partners?

3957
03:04:50,650 --> 03:04:52,650
Yeah, like, were we detective partners?

3958
03:04:53,170 --> 03:04:54,090
Were we...

3959
03:04:54,090 --> 03:04:54,990
Were we...

3960
03:04:55,470 --> 03:04:57,390
I don't think we were detective partners, though.

3961
03:04:57,390 --> 03:04:59,490
Because they would have known we were detectives together.

3962
03:04:59,750 --> 03:05:00,450
I don't know.

3963
03:05:00,590 --> 03:05:01,470
I think we were brothers!

3964
03:05:02,290 --> 03:05:03,770
What in the world?

3965
03:05:04,290 --> 03:05:05,850
What in the world could this mean?

3966
03:05:06,410 --> 03:05:09,290
Why is there a painting of me in this man's cell?

3967
03:05:12,950 --> 03:05:14,170
Oh my God.

3968
03:05:14,370 --> 03:05:15,890
Who exactly is this prisoner?

3969
03:05:16,090 --> 03:05:20,250
The man whose case Lin is investigating is painting a picture of me in a cell.

3970
03:05:21,230 --> 03:05:22,590
If only he could read.

3971
03:05:23,630 --> 03:05:25,290
I have to go see Lin fast.

3972
03:05:25,570 --> 03:05:26,630
Not for her sake.

3973
03:05:26,630 --> 03:05:27,470
For mine.

3974
03:05:27,610 --> 03:05:29,550
To solve this mystery of me.

3975
03:05:35,370 --> 03:05:36,790
Eat the chicken.

3976
03:05:38,070 --> 03:05:38,550
Napkin.

3977
03:05:39,490 --> 03:05:39,970
Bottle.

3978
03:06:14,870 --> 03:06:15,510
That's me.

3979
03:06:17,730 --> 03:06:18,210
Alright.

3980
03:06:18,270 --> 03:06:20,790
We know we can get to her by going through the phone.

3981
03:06:23,710 --> 03:06:24,870
Doesn't connect to the outside.

3982
03:06:25,270 --> 03:06:26,850
And I've got questions I want to ask Lin.

3983
03:06:26,990 --> 03:06:27,130
Yeah.

3984
03:06:27,130 --> 03:06:27,970
We go to the office.

3985
03:06:28,330 --> 03:06:30,890
Got to get to a place that has an external line and fast.

3986
03:06:31,370 --> 03:06:31,890
Yeah.

3987
03:06:31,930 --> 03:06:32,090
Yeah.

3988
03:06:32,090 --> 03:06:32,450
I know.

3989
03:06:32,490 --> 03:06:32,790
I know.

3990
03:06:33,530 --> 03:06:34,750
The guard room.

3991
03:06:43,360 --> 03:06:44,220
Moshi moshi.

3992
03:06:45,580 --> 03:06:46,980
This is headquarters.

3993
03:06:47,420 --> 03:06:49,020
What's the status over there?

3994
03:06:49,840 --> 03:06:50,660
Oh, chief.

3995
03:06:50,740 --> 03:06:51,140
It's you.

3996
03:06:52,420 --> 03:06:54,180
They're making preparations now.

3997
03:06:54,260 --> 03:06:55,300
No problem, sir.

3998
03:06:56,820 --> 03:06:58,300
How much longer, then?

3999
03:06:59,580 --> 03:07:01,360
One more hour, sir.

4000
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:02,700
I see.

4001
03:07:02,780 --> 03:07:03,040
I see.

4002
03:07:03,040 --> 03:07:03,600
Can't really...

4003
03:07:03,600 --> 03:07:04,940
One more hour?

4004
03:07:05,720 --> 03:07:07,560
Oh, one more thing.

4005
03:07:07,700 --> 03:07:08,820
What is it, Columbo?

4006
03:07:09,580 --> 03:07:12,040
Inspector Cabanela wishes to speak to you.

4007
03:07:14,100 --> 03:07:18,380
I think Cabanela is the guy who's done everything.

4008
03:07:18,840 --> 03:07:19,980
I think it's him.

4009
03:07:20,240 --> 03:07:22,220
I think he's going to do a switch on us.

4010
03:07:22,920 --> 03:07:23,480
Evening.

4011
03:07:23,600 --> 03:07:24,400
Cabanela here.

4012
03:07:24,580 --> 03:07:25,820
How are you boys doing?

4013
03:07:26,580 --> 03:07:27,420
Hubba hubba.

4014
03:07:27,920 --> 03:07:29,020
Inspector Cabanela.

4015
03:07:29,120 --> 03:07:29,760
Fine, sir.

4016
03:07:30,900 --> 03:07:33,020
You got another little call tonight, didn't you?

4017
03:07:33,020 --> 03:07:34,320
From my baby.

4018
03:07:37,100 --> 03:07:38,480
Oh, from Lin?

4019
03:07:38,680 --> 03:07:40,140
Uh, well, yes...

4020
03:07:40,140 --> 03:07:40,420
No!

4021
03:07:41,800 --> 03:07:42,360
Bailey!

4022
03:07:42,620 --> 03:07:44,260
You weren't supposed to snitch.

4023
03:07:45,440 --> 03:07:47,020
Chief has his dogs out.

4024
03:07:47,640 --> 03:07:48,480
What do you mean?

4025
03:07:49,400 --> 03:07:52,820
Did my girl have anything interesting to say?

4026
03:07:54,160 --> 03:07:55,280
Uh, not especially.

4027
03:07:55,440 --> 03:07:56,760
She hung up almost immediately.

4028
03:07:57,780 --> 03:07:58,700
I see.

4029
03:08:00,840 --> 03:08:03,000
Next time she gives you a buzz, you're going to have to tell her.

4030
03:08:03,020 --> 03:08:04,420
Be sure to let me know right away.

4031
03:08:05,060 --> 03:08:06,260
That's a good fellow.

4032
03:08:07,760 --> 03:08:08,500
Yes, sir.

4033
03:08:10,560 --> 03:08:14,120
You try to cover it up and I'm sure you'll regret it very much.

4034
03:08:14,820 --> 03:08:15,700
Very much.

4035
03:08:16,060 --> 03:08:17,520
Thank you very much.

4036
03:08:18,520 --> 03:08:19,280
Yes, sir.

4037
03:08:19,380 --> 03:08:20,620
I'll call you right away, sir.

4038
03:08:20,940 --> 03:08:21,420
Immediately.

4039
03:08:22,960 --> 03:08:24,540
I can kind of see...

4040
03:08:24,540 --> 03:08:26,700
I can catch glimpses of his feet.

4041
03:08:27,680 --> 03:08:30,020
Don't forget, she's a fugitive after all.

4042
03:08:31,160 --> 03:08:31,960
Yes, sir.

4043
03:08:32,520 --> 03:08:33,000
Yes, sir.

4044
03:08:33,020 --> 03:08:33,820
Carry on then.

4045
03:08:33,920 --> 03:08:35,760
I might pop in a little later.

4046
03:08:36,860 --> 03:08:37,660
Yes, sir.

4047
03:08:38,040 --> 03:08:39,560
Looking forward to seeing you, sir.

4048
03:08:40,320 --> 03:08:41,380
Oh my god, his feet.

4049
03:08:41,480 --> 03:08:42,640
Yeah, his shoes are off.

4050
03:08:42,680 --> 03:08:42,940
Why?

4051
03:08:44,620 --> 03:08:47,920
Why did you ride her out, you dummy-dumb?

4052
03:08:53,520 --> 03:08:55,600
Inspector Cabanela seems to be looking for her, too.

4053
03:08:56,640 --> 03:08:57,680
You're Lynn, I mean.

4054
03:08:59,140 --> 03:09:00,020
Inspector Cabanela?

4055
03:09:00,280 --> 03:09:03,060
What would that Special Investigation Unit want with Lynn?

4056
03:09:04,580 --> 03:09:05,120
I don't know.

4057
03:09:05,180 --> 03:09:08,100
I guess something about... something happened that we don't know about.

4058
03:09:10,980 --> 03:09:12,420
Tonight, of all nights.

4059
03:09:14,800 --> 03:09:16,340
He really is barefoot.

4060
03:09:16,380 --> 03:09:17,780
Let's put it on the feet wiki.

4061
03:09:18,400 --> 03:09:18,800
No!

4062
03:09:19,380 --> 03:09:21,600
Do you guys mind if I grab some more water real quick?

4063
03:09:21,660 --> 03:09:22,640
I drank all my coffee.

4064
03:09:22,800 --> 03:09:24,540
I just want some hot water for my throat.

4065
03:09:24,900 --> 03:09:27,040
And I'm gonna get a little snack.

4066
03:09:27,660 --> 03:09:28,680
But it'll be fast.

4067
03:09:28,940 --> 03:09:30,760
Just give me like one minute.

4068
03:09:31,480 --> 03:09:33,020
One minute to go get some drink.

4069
03:09:33,280 --> 03:09:34,080
I'll be right back.

4070
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:35,580
I'm so sorry for taking two breaks.

4071
03:09:35,720 --> 03:09:36,100
I'm sorry!

4072
03:10:56,110 --> 03:10:57,790
I'm back and I have a guest.

4073
03:10:58,710 --> 03:11:03,310
I have a special guest who decided to join me.

4074
03:11:05,170 --> 03:11:05,690
Paz!

4075
03:11:08,500 --> 03:11:09,020
Paz!

4076
03:11:09,020 --> 03:11:10,260
What you doing in here?

4077
03:11:10,820 --> 03:11:12,140
You silly girl!

4078
03:11:12,740 --> 03:11:14,280
What are you doing in here, Paz?

4079
03:11:16,100 --> 03:11:17,280
I got some...

4080
03:11:17,280 --> 03:11:18,260
Oh, they're wet.

4081
03:11:18,560 --> 03:11:19,660
Why is it so wet?

4082
03:11:21,740 --> 03:11:22,940
That container that's wet.

4083
03:11:23,060 --> 03:11:23,400
Why?

4084
03:11:23,680 --> 03:11:24,200
I don't know.

4085
03:11:24,780 --> 03:11:25,580
It's my cat.

4086
03:11:25,860 --> 03:11:26,580
She's here.

4087
03:11:27,300 --> 03:11:27,660
Oh!

4088
03:11:27,880 --> 03:11:28,760
What are you getting into?

4089
03:11:29,460 --> 03:11:29,820
No!

4090
03:11:29,820 --> 03:11:30,040
No!

4091
03:11:30,040 --> 03:11:30,220
No!

4092
03:11:30,220 --> 03:11:30,940
Hold on!

4093
03:11:31,060 --> 03:11:31,320
Oh!

4094
03:11:31,360 --> 03:11:31,500
No!

4095
03:11:31,620 --> 03:11:31,740
No!

4096
03:11:31,780 --> 03:11:31,920
No!

4097
03:11:31,940 --> 03:11:32,040
No!

4098
03:11:32,160 --> 03:11:32,520
No!

4099
03:11:41,030 --> 03:11:41,390
No!

4100
03:11:41,530 --> 03:11:41,890
No!

4101
03:11:42,370 --> 03:11:42,730
No!

4102
03:11:43,130 --> 03:11:43,190
No!

4103
03:11:43,190 --> 03:11:43,230
No!

4104
03:11:43,590 --> 03:11:43,950
No!

4105
03:11:43,950 --> 03:11:44,070
No!

4106
03:11:44,070 --> 03:11:44,170
No!

4107
03:11:44,350 --> 03:11:44,470
No!

4108
03:11:44,850 --> 03:11:45,210
No!

4109
03:11:45,510 --> 03:11:45,690
I'm so sorry, guys.

4110
03:11:45,690 --> 03:11:46,210
I'm so sorry.

4111
03:11:47,790 --> 03:11:48,430
One second.

4112
03:11:48,630 --> 03:11:49,130
Oh, gosh.

4113
03:11:49,130 --> 03:11:51,490
I need to put my food down, but I don't know where to put it.

4114
03:11:51,870 --> 03:11:53,250
Oh, my gosh.

4115
03:12:10,410 --> 03:12:10,810
Okay.

4116
03:12:46,180 --> 03:12:46,780
We're good.

4117
03:12:47,800 --> 03:12:48,440
We're good.

4118
03:12:49,020 --> 03:12:52,220
She really said, venceremos.

4119
03:12:53,960 --> 03:13:00,680
Sometimes I know it's like with Meryl, but sometimes I like to be like, you said you'd be a good girl.

4120
03:13:00,680 --> 03:13:06,040
A little pause... and we are back.

4121
03:13:07,380 --> 03:13:30,600
A little pause... and we are back.

4122
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:34,900
That's why he calls Lynn his baby.

4123
03:13:35,420 --> 03:13:35,900
That's why he calls Lynn his baby.

4124
03:13:39,670 --> 03:13:40,490
I think.

4125
03:13:43,070 --> 03:13:43,850
I think.

4126
03:13:44,030 --> 03:13:44,130
I think.

4127
03:13:45,330 --> 03:13:46,450
You sure about that?

4128
03:13:46,790 --> 03:13:48,050
They were such good friends.

4129
03:13:48,630 --> 03:13:51,230
How come Inspector Cabanella never came to visit him?

4130
03:13:51,650 --> 03:13:52,250
How come Inspector Cabanella never came to visit him?

4131
03:13:54,910 --> 03:13:56,810
He's the head of a special investigation.

4132
03:13:57,190 --> 03:13:57,370
He's the head of a special investigation.

4133
03:13:57,370 --> 03:13:58,490
He's a very busy man.

4134
03:13:58,950 --> 03:13:59,330
He's a very busy man.

4135
03:14:01,150 --> 03:14:03,390
You couldn't be that stylish and a bad guy

4136
03:14:12,150 --> 03:14:13,710
Rotting away in a place...

4137
03:14:13,710 --> 03:14:16,790
I think this guy does have a southern accent.

4138
03:14:18,710 --> 03:14:20,250
Rotting away in a place like this.

4139
03:14:20,990 --> 03:14:22,570
Wait, how do I do a southern accent?

4140
03:14:22,850 --> 03:14:25,110
And I can't even do anything to help Lynn.

4141
03:14:25,870 --> 03:14:27,430
What am I doing with my life?

4142
03:14:29,690 --> 03:14:31,210
This new side of you.

4143
03:14:31,230 --> 03:14:32,790
It's kind of endearing.

4144
03:14:33,590 --> 03:14:35,430
Gosh, are you developing a crush?

4145
03:14:37,910 --> 03:14:40,810
Anyway, the thing to do is work at fixing what you can.

4146
03:14:40,910 --> 03:14:41,290
Anyway, the thing to do is work at fixing what you can.

4147
03:14:41,290 --> 03:14:41,850
Little by little.

4148
03:14:42,590 --> 03:14:44,650
Like, for example, your house of cards.

4149
03:14:44,870 --> 03:14:46,110
It collapsed, you know.

4150
03:14:48,510 --> 03:14:49,930
Can love bloom?

4151
03:14:51,550 --> 03:14:53,490
Even in the prison office?

4152
03:14:58,090 --> 03:14:59,910
Lynn should be heading for the chicken kitchen now.

4153
03:15:01,150 --> 03:15:03,650
Call from the police headquarters intrigues me too.

4154
03:15:06,450 --> 03:15:06,890
Hmm...

4155
03:15:07,930 --> 03:15:09,810
It's looking pretty obvious right now.

4156
03:15:09,910 --> 03:15:11,970
That white suited inspector suspects Lynn.

4157
03:15:12,350 --> 03:15:14,110
And she's being considered a fugitive.

4158
03:15:14,290 --> 03:15:15,210
This is not good.

4159
03:15:16,550 --> 03:15:19,590
I wonder if I should go check in on the chief and the inspector in white too.

4160
03:15:21,370 --> 03:15:22,370
I wonder if I should go check in on the chief and the inspector in white too.

4161
03:15:22,370 --> 03:15:24,430
I think we should get the information to her first.

4162
03:15:24,670 --> 03:15:24,830
I think we should get the information to her first.

4163
03:15:24,830 --> 03:15:25,130
Right?

4164
03:15:25,310 --> 03:15:25,950
Oh wait, dial.

4165
03:15:26,990 --> 03:15:27,970
Dial, dial, dial.

4166
03:15:29,510 --> 03:15:30,390
External line.

4167
03:15:30,650 --> 03:15:32,630
Oh my gosh, we're getting so many places now.

4168
03:15:34,710 --> 03:15:36,790
Is Lynn the only woman in this world?

4169
03:15:36,830 --> 03:15:36,890
Is Lynn the only woman in this world?

4170
03:15:36,890 --> 03:15:37,510
I know, right?

4171
03:15:39,130 --> 03:15:42,030
Besides the roommate, she is the only other girl we've met.

4172
03:15:43,010 --> 03:15:43,650
I think.

4173
03:15:44,610 --> 03:15:46,290
Oh, and the mom.

4174
03:15:46,850 --> 03:15:48,090
That fancy lady.

4175
03:15:51,810 --> 03:15:53,090
The chicken kitchen.

4176
03:15:55,470 --> 03:15:57,950
This is where that little lady and Lynn are supposed to meet.

4177
03:15:58,990 --> 03:15:59,430
But...

4178
03:16:02,860 --> 03:16:04,460
I don't see either one of them here.

4179
03:16:05,300 --> 03:16:06,500
Oh yeah, and her daughter.

4180
03:16:06,640 --> 03:16:07,400
So true, so true.

4181
03:16:08,160 --> 03:16:09,440
Guess they haven't shown up yet.

4182
03:16:09,940 --> 03:16:11,260
It's been so much time.

4183
03:16:11,340 --> 03:16:12,500
What do you mean they haven't shown up?

4184
03:16:13,520 --> 03:16:14,900
This music is so funky.

4185
03:16:19,180 --> 03:16:19,980
There's someone singing.

4186
03:16:20,660 --> 03:16:21,680
In my right ear.

4187
03:16:23,900 --> 03:16:24,340
Oh!

4188
03:16:35,250 --> 03:16:37,910
Sorry, I'll quiet down.

4189
03:16:38,470 --> 03:16:38,910
Yeah.

4190
03:16:39,330 --> 03:16:40,630
Pipe down there, mister.

4191
03:16:46,270 --> 03:16:46,990
Hello?

4192
03:16:47,590 --> 03:16:49,230
I would like some service.

4193
03:16:52,390 --> 03:16:53,110
Alright.

4194
03:16:53,450 --> 03:16:57,030
I guess we have to go to the other place before...

4195
03:16:58,450 --> 03:16:59,610
They're forcing me.

4196
03:16:59,790 --> 03:17:01,810
They're forcing me to go to here.

4197
03:17:02,310 --> 03:17:05,450
Before we can experience chicken dining.

4198
03:17:06,670 --> 03:17:08,230
Fine chicken dining.

4199
03:17:09,070 --> 03:17:10,170
Mm-hmm.

4200
03:17:13,820 --> 03:17:14,840
In the law.

4201
03:17:17,980 --> 03:17:18,880
Oh, his toes!

4202
03:17:21,580 --> 03:17:23,820
Preparation seemed to be going smoothly over at the prison.

4203
03:17:24,020 --> 03:17:25,360
Eh, Inspector Cabanela?

4204
03:17:28,700 --> 03:17:30,240
We were just a little too late.

4205
03:17:30,400 --> 03:17:31,680
So close, eh, Inspector?

4206
03:17:35,040 --> 03:17:36,300
We still have a little...

4207
03:17:36,300 --> 03:17:38,380
A little time left, Chief.

4208
03:17:38,380 --> 03:17:39,600
Not much, but some.

4209
03:17:41,160 --> 03:17:43,300
We've had Point X surrounded all night.

4210
03:17:44,140 --> 03:17:46,240
If he shows up, we nab him.

4211
03:17:46,320 --> 03:17:47,720
And we can still make it.

4212
03:17:50,340 --> 03:17:51,820
If he shows up...

4213
03:17:51,820 --> 03:17:53,440
The real murderer of the wife?

4214
03:17:55,620 --> 03:17:58,420
But then why would you even tell that guy that he's gonna die?

4215
03:17:59,300 --> 03:17:59,780
Tomorrow.

4216
03:18:01,360 --> 03:18:01,840
Unless...

4217
03:18:02,240 --> 03:18:04,140
He has nothing on his board because...

4218
03:18:04,140 --> 03:18:05,500
He's getting away free!

4219
03:18:05,620 --> 03:18:06,380
They're letting him out!

4220
03:18:08,840 --> 03:18:09,280
Mmm...

4221
03:18:12,410 --> 03:18:13,290
By the way...

4222
03:18:13,950 --> 03:18:15,150
What's going on with that other case?

4223
03:18:15,310 --> 03:18:16,230
The junkyard murder.

4224
03:18:17,270 --> 03:18:18,130
She did it, eh?

4225
03:18:18,230 --> 03:18:19,290
No question about it?

4226
03:18:21,170 --> 03:18:21,610
...

4227
03:18:26,690 --> 03:18:27,810
I don't want to...

4228
03:18:31,760 --> 03:18:33,160
She's been a bad little baby.

4229
03:18:34,280 --> 03:18:35,580
Disappeared from the scene like that.

4230
03:18:35,800 --> 03:18:37,360
Wonder where she ran off to play.

4231
03:18:38,580 --> 03:18:39,020
No...

4232
03:18:40,420 --> 03:18:41,520
What did he just say?

4233
03:18:41,820 --> 03:18:42,860
She did it?

4234
03:18:42,920 --> 03:18:44,000
Did I hear that right?

4235
03:18:44,420 --> 03:18:46,620
I think they were talking about the culprit who killed me.

4236
03:18:47,720 --> 03:18:48,520
No way.

4237
03:18:50,540 --> 03:18:51,420
No way.

4238
03:18:56,030 --> 03:18:56,750
Trick time.

4239
03:18:57,430 --> 03:18:58,750
Can I possess his feet?

4240
03:18:59,010 --> 03:18:59,750
Good lord.

4241
03:19:03,570 --> 03:19:04,370
What is this?

4242
03:19:04,510 --> 03:19:04,850
Oooh!

4243
03:19:08,310 --> 03:19:09,410
I just don't believe it.

4244
03:19:09,490 --> 03:19:10,890
Why would she do a thing like that?

4245
03:19:11,770 --> 03:19:13,970
Afraid I don't have the answers for you, chief.

4246
03:19:14,190 --> 03:19:15,250
I don't want to...

4247
03:19:15,250 --> 03:19:17,070
Believe it any more than you do.

4248
03:19:19,250 --> 03:19:20,130
And yet...

4249
03:19:20,130 --> 03:19:21,590
Stream had a hiccup again?

4250
03:19:23,290 --> 03:19:23,730
Hmm...

4251
03:19:30,670 --> 03:19:32,370
I wonder why there's so many issues tonight.

4252
03:19:33,010 --> 03:19:33,950
Oh, no hiccup here?

4253
03:19:44,800 --> 03:19:48,220
After seeing this, maybe we don't have any other choice but to believe, baby.

4254
03:19:49,260 --> 03:19:49,800
After seeing this, maybe we don't have any other choice but to believe, baby.

4255
03:19:50,140 --> 03:19:53,120
Is that the security camera tape the investigation unit just delivered?

4256
03:19:53,380 --> 03:19:53,580
Is that the security camera tape the investigation unit just delivered?

4257
03:19:54,520 --> 03:19:54,900
I can't deny.

4258
03:19:55,200 --> 03:19:57,700
It's some pretty solid evidence against her.

4259
03:19:58,340 --> 03:20:00,400
Watch, the tape is going to be...

4260
03:20:00,400 --> 03:20:02,680
This is some actual Phoenix Wright shit.

4261
03:20:02,860 --> 03:20:04,860
Where the tape will be like...

4262
03:20:04,860 --> 03:20:06,760
Them standing each other talking...

4263
03:20:06,760 --> 03:20:07,960
And then it cuts out...

4264
03:20:07,960 --> 03:20:09,620
And then she's like holding his body.

4265
03:20:10,540 --> 03:20:12,720
Because the actual murder part...

4266
03:20:12,720 --> 03:20:13,420
Gets...

4267
03:20:13,420 --> 03:20:16,000
Gets deleted somehow.

4268
03:20:21,850 --> 03:20:24,210
I just dropped my fork.

4269
03:20:32,610 --> 03:20:34,050
I just dropped my fork.

4270
03:20:34,050 --> 03:20:34,410
I like it, baby.

4271
03:20:41,290 --> 03:20:42,510
It's okay, they're just fries.

4272
03:20:42,910 --> 03:20:44,130
I can eat them with my fingies.

4273
03:20:44,150 --> 03:20:45,710
I was just trying to avoid greasy hands.

4274
03:20:46,990 --> 03:20:49,270
Why a murder case now on such an important night?

4275
03:20:51,250 --> 03:20:52,590
Put your feet...

4276
03:20:52,590 --> 03:20:55,150
Put your shoes on, man!

4277
03:20:55,330 --> 03:20:56,050
Come on!

4278
03:20:56,790 --> 03:20:58,250
I think you have that wrong, chief.

4279
03:21:05,330 --> 03:21:06,410
Chopsticks are for fries?

4280
03:21:07,810 --> 03:21:08,210
Okay.

4281
03:21:08,870 --> 03:21:10,030
I didn't want to say...

4282
03:21:10,030 --> 03:21:11,370
It was one of those gaming chopsticks.

4283
03:21:13,010 --> 03:21:14,750
You know those ones that you like...

4284
03:21:14,750 --> 03:21:16,650
Put on your fingers so that you can...

4285
03:21:18,110 --> 03:21:20,850
So that you can type on your keyboard.

4286
03:21:22,530 --> 03:21:24,830
So I just called it a fork.

4287
03:21:25,470 --> 03:21:25,910
Because

4288
03:21:29,970 --> 03:21:31,170
I was embarrassed to say...

4289
03:21:31,170 --> 03:21:33,150
Oh, I dropped my gaming chopsticks.

4290
03:21:37,450 --> 03:21:38,690
No, dang it!

4291
03:21:38,810 --> 03:21:40,570
And then you guys started calling me out...

4292
03:21:40,570 --> 03:21:41,570
For it being a fork.

4293
03:21:44,970 --> 03:21:46,130
No, you guys know what I'm talking about, right?

4294
03:21:46,870 --> 03:21:48,850
So you put them in between like your...

4295
03:21:48,850 --> 03:21:50,170
Index and your middle finger.

4296
03:21:50,810 --> 03:21:52,030
And it like sticks there.

4297
03:21:52,190 --> 03:21:52,890
It stays there.

4298
03:21:53,050 --> 03:21:53,810
And then you can like...

4299
03:21:53,810 --> 03:21:55,350
With your knuckles, you like...

4300
03:21:55,350 --> 03:21:57,310
You can...

4301
03:21:58,930 --> 03:22:00,190
So you can type.

4302
03:22:00,250 --> 03:22:01,990
And also have the chopsticks on your fingers.

4303
03:22:05,570 --> 03:22:06,970
The little tweezer looking things.

4304
03:22:07,070 --> 03:22:07,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4305
03:22:08,050 --> 03:22:09,690
They're like barely chopsticks at all.

4306
03:22:10,550 --> 03:22:11,350
But like...

4307
03:22:14,270 --> 03:22:15,510
That's what I was using.

4308
03:22:15,990 --> 03:22:18,330
I was embarrassed to say it.

4309
03:22:18,650 --> 03:22:20,670
Now I think I'm even more embarrassed.

4310
03:22:20,890 --> 03:22:21,710
Trying to imagine.

4311
03:22:21,850 --> 03:22:23,230
Let me see if I can get a picture real quick.

4312
03:22:29,290 --> 03:22:30,170
Oh no!

4313
03:22:33,910 --> 03:22:35,810
I hate this image so much.

4314
03:22:37,050 --> 03:22:37,490
Okay.

4315
03:22:37,550 --> 03:22:38,670
This is what they're like.

4316
03:22:38,790 --> 03:22:39,630
This is what they're...

4317
03:22:40,930 --> 03:22:41,370
This

4318
03:22:46,580 --> 03:22:47,840
is what I was using.

4319
03:22:50,540 --> 03:22:50,880
Oh no!

4320
03:23:03,600 --> 03:23:05,000
Advanced Gamer.

4321
03:23:05,080 --> 03:23:06,780
Yeah, because I was holding my controller.

4322
03:23:07,780 --> 03:23:10,260
And eating my fries.

4323
03:23:14,850 --> 03:23:15,970
Now you know.

4324
03:23:18,910 --> 03:23:20,570
I'd be embarrassed too.

4325
03:23:22,250 --> 03:23:24,470
I love my cringe Oshii.

4326
03:23:29,440 --> 03:23:31,030
A murder case now.

4327
03:23:31,210 --> 03:23:33,250
For the very reason that...

4328
03:23:33,770 --> 03:23:34,810
He is such an important guy.

4329
03:23:36,330 --> 03:23:37,550
To his toes.

4330
03:23:42,110 --> 03:23:42,590
Let's see.

4331
03:23:42,650 --> 03:23:43,250
What else can I do?

4332
03:23:46,810 --> 03:23:47,250
Alarm.

4333
03:23:47,690 --> 03:23:48,130
Speaker.

4334
03:23:48,350 --> 03:23:49,170
Oh, let's lower the screen.

4335
03:23:49,370 --> 03:23:50,410
Let's watch the tape.

4336
03:23:50,730 --> 03:23:51,390
After all.

4337
03:23:57,170 --> 03:23:58,290
Let's watch the tape.

4338
03:24:01,090 --> 03:24:01,530
Oh.

4339
03:24:02,210 --> 03:24:04,170
They don't seem to care at all actually.

4340
03:24:04,930 --> 03:24:07,010
The junkyard where I died had a security camera.

4341
03:24:07,150 --> 03:24:09,250
And it captured the moment of my death perfectly.

4342
03:24:10,110 --> 03:24:10,470
Okay.

4343
03:24:12,230 --> 03:24:13,410
And what the tape showed me.

4344
03:24:13,530 --> 03:24:15,310
Was the cruelest truth imaginable.

4345
03:24:15,450 --> 03:24:15,750
Uh oh.

4346
03:24:24,410 --> 03:24:25,030
Oh my god.

4347
03:24:25,070 --> 03:24:25,450
We're moving.

4348
03:24:25,550 --> 03:24:25,930
We're alive.

4349
03:24:30,070 --> 03:24:30,790
It was...

4350
03:24:34,920 --> 03:24:35,740
I don't know.

4351
03:24:37,280 --> 03:24:37,920
Oh my god.

4352
03:24:37,940 --> 03:24:39,740
That briefcase has been there the whole time.

4353
03:24:54,660 --> 03:24:55,840
Did she actually?

4354
03:25:11,720 --> 03:25:12,620
I was wrong.

4355
03:25:18,480 --> 03:25:18,920
Yeah.

4356
03:25:19,000 --> 03:25:19,900
That's pretty conclusive.

4357
03:25:20,020 --> 03:25:21,220
I would say so.

4358
03:25:27,150 --> 03:25:29,910
I saw myself shot right before my own eyes.

4359
03:25:30,070 --> 03:25:30,770
By Lin.

4360
03:25:31,210 --> 03:25:32,530
There goes my only lead.

4361
03:25:32,790 --> 03:25:34,730
I feel like I've died all over again.

4362
03:25:34,890 --> 03:25:35,230
Unless.

4363
03:25:35,410 --> 03:25:36,910
Unless they were blanks.

4364
03:25:37,950 --> 03:25:38,390
Right?

4365
03:25:38,670 --> 03:25:39,930
They must have been blanks.

4366
03:25:39,930 --> 03:25:40,950
And then when I died for real.

4367
03:25:41,010 --> 03:25:41,530
She was like.

4368
03:25:41,590 --> 03:25:42,190
Oh my god.

4369
03:25:42,190 --> 03:25:42,890
What?

4370
03:25:45,790 --> 03:25:47,090
One thing sticks with me though.

4371
03:25:47,250 --> 03:25:48,990
Lin looked so surprised on that tape.

4372
03:25:49,130 --> 03:25:50,570
What in the world did I tell her?

4373
03:26:00,140 --> 03:26:01,460
The truth is the truth.

4374
03:26:01,640 --> 03:26:03,220
No matter how many times you watch it.

4375
03:26:03,280 --> 03:26:04,180
Inspector Cabanela.

4376
03:26:07,860 --> 03:26:10,140
It wasn't me who played the tape just now baby.

4377
03:26:13,480 --> 03:26:14,280
Oh by the way.

4378
03:26:14,300 --> 03:26:14,520
Okay.

4379
03:26:14,540 --> 03:26:16,080
We're just gonna ignore that fact.

4380
03:26:16,920 --> 03:26:17,760
Okay Inspector Cabanela.

4381
03:26:18,120 --> 03:26:20,000
There's something on that tape that troubles me.

4382
03:26:20,980 --> 03:26:21,880
What is that Chief?

4383
03:26:22,020 --> 03:26:22,680
I'm all ears.

4384
03:26:24,860 --> 03:26:27,260
I had a look at all the photos of the crime scene as well.

4385
03:26:27,400 --> 03:26:27,720
But...

4386
03:26:29,440 --> 03:26:31,100
The place where the victim was shot.

4387
03:26:31,260 --> 03:26:32,920
And where the body was found.

4388
03:26:33,060 --> 03:26:34,060
Is clearly different.

4389
03:26:36,900 --> 03:26:37,300
No.

4390
03:26:37,340 --> 03:26:38,480
Didn't we know that reason?

4391
03:26:39,980 --> 03:26:41,040
He got pushed down.

4392
03:26:41,120 --> 03:26:41,400
Didn't he?

4393
03:26:41,860 --> 03:26:43,480
By the bad guy.

4394
03:26:45,040 --> 03:26:45,440
Yeah.

4395
03:26:45,460 --> 03:26:46,800
He got kicked and fell over.

4396
03:26:48,920 --> 03:26:49,960
So we knew that already.

4397
03:26:50,160 --> 03:26:50,460
So we knew that already.

4398
03:26:51,680 --> 03:26:52,080
Yeah.

4399
03:26:52,160 --> 03:26:53,940
The hitman in black is the one who kicked me downstairs.

4400
03:26:54,600 --> 03:26:55,000
Yeah.

4401
03:26:55,000 --> 03:26:55,140
The hitman in black is the one who kicked me downstairs.

4402
03:26:55,440 --> 03:26:56,620
But I changed his fate.

4403
03:26:56,680 --> 03:26:57,520
So he should have been...

4404
03:26:57,520 --> 03:27:03,670
I changed his fate.

4405
03:27:03,830 --> 03:27:05,610
So he should have been out of the picture.

4406
03:27:07,610 --> 03:27:08,230
That's right.

4407
03:27:14,130 --> 03:27:15,090
But there I am.

4408
03:27:15,130 --> 03:27:16,210
Down on the lower level.

4409
03:27:20,130 --> 03:27:22,210
It's hard to remember what happened before.

4410
03:27:23,930 --> 03:27:26,250
It's hard to remember what happened before.

4411
03:27:26,250 --> 03:27:29,010
I have the answer to your mystery right here.

4412
03:27:29,150 --> 03:27:29,250
I have the answer to your mystery right here.

4413
03:27:29,250 --> 03:27:30,930
A few minutes after the murder took place.

4414
03:27:31,290 --> 03:27:31,830
Okay.

4415
03:27:32,870 --> 03:27:33,410
Nice.

4416
03:27:33,590 --> 03:27:35,490
Security cameras that actually work.

4417
03:27:35,590 --> 03:27:36,090
This is insane.

4418
03:27:38,170 --> 03:27:39,410
Do I just fall over?

4419
03:27:44,070 --> 03:27:46,630
Why was there a cat in my briefcase?

4420
03:27:47,650 --> 03:27:48,910
Why was there a cat in my briefcase?

4421
03:27:48,910 --> 03:27:49,010
What?

4422
03:27:53,830 --> 03:27:55,230
Is that a black cat?

4423
03:27:56,650 --> 03:27:57,650
You got it, baby.

4424
03:27:57,790 --> 03:28:00,270
A furry feline messed up our crime scene.

4425
03:28:01,090 --> 03:28:04,090
And then the little cat pulper vanished into the night.

4426
03:28:04,430 --> 03:28:04,750
And then the little cat pulper vanished into the night.

4427
03:28:05,190 --> 03:28:05,670
Hmm.

4428
03:28:07,150 --> 03:28:10,770
Looks like my destiny of being knocked downstairs is very hard to alter.

4429
03:28:11,170 --> 03:28:11,650
Looks like my destiny of being knocked downstairs is very hard to alter.

4430
03:28:12,430 --> 03:28:13,170
Uh oh.

4431
03:28:16,560 --> 03:28:17,700
This is point X.

4432
03:28:17,840 --> 03:28:18,580
Come in, chief.

4433
03:28:19,620 --> 03:28:20,360
Oh my god.

4434
03:28:21,540 --> 03:28:22,380
The chief here?

4435
03:28:22,700 --> 03:28:23,540
Did he show up?

4436
03:28:24,300 --> 03:28:24,820
No, sir.

4437
03:28:24,820 --> 03:28:25,480
Not yet, but...

4438
03:28:25,960 --> 03:28:26,320
Idiot.

4439
03:28:26,400 --> 03:28:28,500
I told you to stay off the radio unless it was so important.

4440
03:28:29,300 --> 03:28:30,940
But this is important, sir.

4441
03:28:31,340 --> 03:28:32,300
Somebody else showed up.

4442
03:28:34,900 --> 03:28:36,700
Our rookie detective, Lynn.

4443
03:28:39,580 --> 03:28:40,100
Ruh-roh.

4444
03:28:42,480 --> 03:28:44,140
You see my baby over there, do you?

4445
03:28:47,560 --> 03:28:48,900
I heard she was on the lam.

4446
03:28:49,120 --> 03:28:50,220
What do you want me to do, chief?

4447
03:28:51,740 --> 03:28:52,780
What do you say, inspector?

4448
03:28:55,400 --> 03:28:56,820
There's no time for dancing.

4449
03:28:57,640 --> 03:28:58,040
Detective.

4450
03:28:58,880 --> 03:29:00,840
Get my baby away from point X.

4451
03:29:01,060 --> 03:29:01,520
Uh oh.

4452
03:29:02,800 --> 03:29:03,920
The launch codes.

4453
03:29:06,060 --> 03:29:06,860
Maybe the...

4454
03:29:07,920 --> 03:29:09,940
I think we know where they're touching down.

4455
03:29:12,500 --> 03:29:13,680
Do it now, man.

4456
03:29:13,900 --> 03:29:15,320
And then hold on to her.

4457
03:29:16,660 --> 03:29:17,220
Yes, sir.

4458
03:29:17,320 --> 03:29:18,580
I'll get her right now, sir.

4459
03:29:22,060 --> 03:29:23,260
What is the meaning of this?

4460
03:29:23,360 --> 03:29:24,240
Why would Lynn show up here?

4461
03:29:24,260 --> 03:29:24,760
Why would she show up at point X?

4462
03:29:29,340 --> 03:29:33,800
It took the special investigation unit six months to pinpoint that location.

4463
03:29:35,980 --> 03:29:36,580
Don't know, chief.

4464
03:29:36,880 --> 03:29:38,600
But I'd say it wasn't a coincidence.

4465
03:29:41,320 --> 03:29:41,960
Perhaps...

4466
03:29:42,860 --> 03:29:44,380
It was a ghost trick.

4467
03:29:45,780 --> 03:29:46,420
What?

4468
03:29:47,120 --> 03:29:47,900
Uh oh.

4469
03:29:47,900 --> 03:29:49,220
Uh oh.

4470
03:29:58,370 --> 03:29:59,190
Now what?

4471
03:29:59,310 --> 03:30:00,430
What happened this time?

4472
03:30:01,650 --> 03:30:02,290
Damn it.

4473
03:30:04,410 --> 03:30:05,950
Why did his feet do that?

4474
03:30:06,310 --> 03:30:08,450
This calls for a telephone call to point X.

4475
03:30:08,590 --> 03:30:09,370
Allow me.

4476
03:30:10,770 --> 03:30:11,950
Oh, yeah, you're allowed.

4477
03:30:15,370 --> 03:30:16,650
Trick time, baby.

4478
03:30:17,430 --> 03:30:18,650
No time to waste.

4479
03:30:18,970 --> 03:30:19,010
Oh.

4480
03:30:19,370 --> 03:30:19,870
Uh.

4481
03:30:23,460 --> 03:30:24,860
Maybe just a little bit of time.

4482
03:30:24,860 --> 03:30:26,340
Why is he doing that with his feet?

4483
03:30:28,180 --> 03:30:29,720
Just a little bit of time to waste.

4484
03:30:31,080 --> 03:30:32,480
And then we lower it.

4485
03:30:34,400 --> 03:30:35,640
And then we...

4486
03:30:35,640 --> 03:30:37,680
Then we go telephone it.

4487
03:30:41,780 --> 03:30:42,700
What are you doing?

4488
03:30:42,800 --> 03:30:44,320
Get your buns over here.

4489
03:30:46,300 --> 03:30:47,180
Oh, shit.

4490
03:30:47,240 --> 03:30:47,980
Is that her on the ground?

4491
03:30:49,040 --> 03:30:49,920
What did you say?

4492
03:30:52,340 --> 03:30:53,540
Now I finally understand.

4493
03:30:53,540 --> 03:30:56,240
I finally know what it's like to murder!

4494
03:30:58,420 --> 03:30:58,900
Oh.

4495
03:30:59,520 --> 03:31:02,700
For our poor hungry customers who have their food deliveries delayed.

4496
03:31:05,120 --> 03:31:05,880
Excuse me?

4497
03:31:05,920 --> 03:31:08,040
I think he needs to go to a doctor for that.

4498
03:31:08,120 --> 03:31:10,340
What is going on with your nose?

4499
03:31:12,280 --> 03:31:14,520
But this is the chicken kitchen, is it not?

4500
03:31:15,460 --> 03:31:15,940
What?

4501
03:31:16,440 --> 03:31:17,740
Aren't I talking to the police?

4502
03:31:19,780 --> 03:31:20,480
The police?

4503
03:31:20,480 --> 03:31:22,860
Did something happen there you need assistance with?

4504
03:31:24,420 --> 03:31:26,060
Something happened here, you ask?

4505
03:31:26,360 --> 03:31:28,020
More like there's nothing left here.

4506
03:31:28,160 --> 03:31:28,840
I gotta go.

4507
03:31:29,840 --> 03:31:30,360
Wait!

4508
03:31:32,940 --> 03:31:34,260
Someone is down.

4509
03:31:38,930 --> 03:31:40,890
This itchy footed man.

4510
03:31:41,430 --> 03:31:41,950
Why?

4511
03:31:42,110 --> 03:31:43,090
You're so nasty.

4512
03:31:43,870 --> 03:31:44,610
What is that?

4513
03:31:44,630 --> 03:31:45,070
What's that called?

4514
03:31:45,250 --> 03:31:46,290
Athlete's foot or something?

4515
03:31:53,210 --> 03:31:54,550
I'm getting my fork.

4516
03:31:57,910 --> 03:31:58,890
Off the ground.

4517
03:32:08,030 --> 03:32:09,050
My fork.

4518
03:32:15,170 --> 03:32:16,610
Off the ground.

4519
03:32:20,110 --> 03:32:20,650
Okay.

4520
03:32:20,910 --> 03:32:21,750
What's going on?

4521
03:32:23,130 --> 03:32:24,010
Something, that's what.

4522
03:32:24,150 --> 03:32:25,610
Something is definitely going on.

4523
03:32:25,910 --> 03:32:27,870
And that something is far from nothing.

4524
03:32:28,070 --> 03:32:29,150
That's for certain.

4525
03:32:29,650 --> 03:32:30,570
So poetic.

4526
03:32:34,770 --> 03:32:36,030
Thanks for the tea, Chief.

4527
03:32:36,030 --> 03:32:37,310
I'll be on my way.

4528
03:32:38,570 --> 03:32:39,890
You going to Point X?

4529
03:32:40,510 --> 03:32:41,350
Point X, eh?

4530
03:32:41,550 --> 03:32:42,770
I'll leave that to the boys.

4531
03:32:43,250 --> 03:32:45,110
There's someplace else I gotta be.

4532
03:32:47,410 --> 03:32:47,850
Inspector.

4533
03:32:52,170 --> 03:32:54,790
Mint, if your feet are ever itchy, I'm here for you, Queen.

4534
03:33:14,130 --> 03:33:14,570
Thanks.

4535
03:33:16,610 --> 03:33:18,390
Your being there isn't going to change anything.

4536
03:33:18,570 --> 03:33:19,670
Why put yourself through it?

4537
03:33:21,610 --> 03:33:24,470
I have a responsibility and I'm going to see it through to the end.

4538
03:33:25,410 --> 03:33:26,810
Okay, maybe he's not a bad guy.

4539
03:33:26,870 --> 03:33:27,710
I can't tell, actually.

4540
03:33:30,450 --> 03:33:32,670
Besides, it's not quite over yet.

4541
03:33:33,870 --> 03:33:34,870
Right, that's true.

4542
03:33:35,130 --> 03:33:36,190
Do what you must then.

4543
03:33:37,150 --> 03:33:38,110
Oh, God.

4544
03:33:38,750 --> 03:33:40,050
They're so jittery.

4545
03:33:47,290 --> 03:33:49,350
Prisoner D99's schedule for tomorrow was blank.

4546
03:33:49,670 --> 03:33:51,690
Seems like forever ago that I found that out.

4547
03:33:51,810 --> 03:33:54,590
Now my mind is even blanker than that blackboard was.

4548
03:33:56,190 --> 03:33:57,690
Lynn, my only lead.

4549
03:33:57,770 --> 03:33:58,950
And my partner shot me.

4550
03:33:59,330 --> 03:34:00,410
What did it all mean?

4551
03:34:01,190 --> 03:34:03,450
I knew where I had to go to get my answers.

4552
03:34:05,170 --> 03:34:06,230
The chicken kitchen.

4553
03:34:06,230 --> 03:34:08,670
The point X the police have surrounded.

4554
03:34:08,950 --> 03:34:11,170
And the place where something big just happened.

4555
03:34:11,370 --> 03:34:15,450
What will Lynn be involved in this time when I find her there?

4556
03:34:15,790 --> 03:34:15,970
What will Lynn be involved in this time when I find her there?

4557
03:34:17,030 --> 03:34:18,650
I kind of want to see...

4558
03:34:18,650 --> 03:34:20,290
Does he go to the jail?

4559
03:34:22,630 --> 03:34:23,030
Yay!

4560
03:34:26,750 --> 03:34:29,470
Oh, I didn't even realize there were stairs over there.

4561
03:34:29,630 --> 03:34:29,870
Oh, I didn't even realize there were stairs over there.

4562
03:34:29,870 --> 03:34:30,770
We just didn't look.

4563
03:34:32,110 --> 03:34:34,250
I didn't even realize there were stairs down there.

4564
03:34:34,690 --> 03:34:36,890
Well, I tried to move, but it just wouldn't let me.

4565
03:34:36,990 --> 03:34:38,190
I was stuck in the jail.

4566
03:34:39,010 --> 03:34:39,810
New song.

4567
03:34:40,330 --> 03:34:41,230
Save the data.

4568
03:34:41,410 --> 03:34:41,770
Nice.

4569
03:34:44,150 --> 03:34:45,070
Alright, let's keep going.

4570
03:34:46,410 --> 03:34:47,390
Wait, how long have I...

4571
03:34:47,390 --> 03:34:48,130
Okay, almost 4 hours.

4572
03:34:48,490 --> 03:34:49,290
Chapter 7!

4573
03:34:51,170 --> 03:34:51,970
We're almost...

4574
03:34:52,930 --> 03:34:53,850
Wait, it's what?

4575
03:34:53,890 --> 03:34:54,490
19 chapters?

4576
03:34:55,510 --> 03:34:55,910
18?

4577
03:34:56,070 --> 03:34:56,350
19?

4578
03:35:01,760 --> 03:35:04,700
I just can't get the images I saw at police headquarters out of my head.

4579
03:35:04,820 --> 03:35:06,080
The person who shot me tonight.

4580
03:35:06,260 --> 03:35:08,500
It's the last person in the world I want to believe did it.

4581
03:35:08,960 --> 03:35:09,360
18.

4582
03:35:09,460 --> 03:35:09,740
Okay.

4583
03:35:10,020 --> 03:35:11,220
We're almost halfway there.

4584
03:35:15,560 --> 03:35:17,700
Now I'm here at the place she and I agreed to meet.

4585
03:35:17,880 --> 03:35:20,540
The restaurant the police were staking out as Point X.

4586
03:35:20,820 --> 03:35:22,800
But when I got there, I found the place in ruins.

4587
03:35:25,980 --> 03:35:27,420
Maybe another 2-3 more streams.

4588
03:35:27,500 --> 03:35:28,260
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

4589
03:35:28,360 --> 03:35:29,320
Unless I...

4590
03:35:32,140 --> 03:35:34,200
Unless I, like, endurance the last part.

4591
03:35:34,980 --> 03:35:35,940
Or the next part.

4592
03:35:37,180 --> 03:35:38,560
What in the world happened here?

4593
03:35:41,080 --> 03:35:41,960
Big chicken!

4594
03:35:42,680 --> 03:35:44,340
Oh my god, she's dead!

4595
03:35:44,960 --> 03:35:45,680
She's dead!

4596
03:35:45,800 --> 03:35:46,360
She's dead!

4597
03:35:48,420 --> 03:35:49,320
Oh, the heavens!

4598
03:35:49,400 --> 03:35:49,960
What do I do?

4599
03:35:50,120 --> 03:35:51,900
If I had known something like this would happen?

4600
03:35:51,980 --> 03:35:53,620
He's so smiley about it though.

4601
03:35:53,840 --> 03:35:55,720
I would have paid the poor child more!

4602
03:35:56,800 --> 03:35:58,920
I would have cooked more chicken for her!

4603
03:35:59,320 --> 03:36:01,980
I would have sung to her as much as she liked!

4604
03:36:02,140 --> 03:36:03,640
Until she had her fill!

4605
03:36:04,480 --> 03:36:05,600
Actually, about the singing.

4606
03:36:05,960 --> 03:36:07,560
She did tell me she had a filler.

4607
03:36:09,900 --> 03:36:12,160
The chef seems to be in quite a panic.

4608
03:36:12,740 --> 03:36:13,780
Oh, she's dead!

4609
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:14,840
She's so cute though!

4610
03:36:14,860 --> 03:36:15,840
You're too cute to die!

4611
03:36:17,180 --> 03:36:19,080
At least it doesn't look like the waitress is dead.

4612
03:36:19,240 --> 03:36:20,320
Oh, just kidding.

4613
03:36:20,560 --> 03:36:21,760
But this guy is!

4614
03:36:25,420 --> 03:36:27,380
That guy sure seems to be dead.

4615
03:36:28,220 --> 03:36:30,120
We're just gonna roll down here.

4616
03:36:36,650 --> 03:36:39,830
According to that police radio conversation, she should be here.

4617
03:36:40,070 --> 03:36:41,290
But I don't see her anywhere.

4618
03:36:42,110 --> 03:36:44,370
Seems like bad luck is in it for that redhead.

4619
03:36:45,470 --> 03:36:47,710
So I was half expecting to see her in trouble again.

4620
03:36:47,890 --> 03:36:48,790
Oh my gosh, that's great.

4621
03:36:48,870 --> 03:36:51,670
I have an itch underneath the thing I put...

4622
03:36:51,670 --> 03:36:54,130
the hot patch I put on my shoulders.

4623
03:36:54,350 --> 03:36:55,950
But I can't get to it because it's...

4624
03:36:55,950 --> 03:36:56,490
Ow!

4625
03:36:57,510 --> 03:36:58,030
I'm good.

4626
03:37:00,070 --> 03:37:01,970
I spotted the corpse of the van driver.

4627
03:37:03,390 --> 03:37:04,790
That poor guy...

4628
03:37:04,790 --> 03:37:05,510
Oh, wait!

4629
03:37:07,090 --> 03:37:07,790
She's there!

4630
03:37:09,410 --> 03:37:10,010
Oh my god!

4631
03:37:11,510 --> 03:37:11,950
Why?

4632
03:37:12,130 --> 03:37:12,890
She was there!

4633
03:37:14,670 --> 03:37:15,310
Look at me!

4634
03:37:15,330 --> 03:37:15,810
I'm dead!

4635
03:37:15,950 --> 03:37:16,970
What took you so long?

4636
03:37:21,110 --> 03:37:22,910
Well, that's one way to greet a guy.

4637
03:37:23,650 --> 03:37:24,590
What happened here?

4638
03:37:28,730 --> 03:37:29,650
How should I know?

4639
03:37:29,730 --> 03:37:30,310
I'm the victim!

4640
03:37:32,450 --> 03:37:33,590
Is it just my imagination?

4641
03:37:33,910 --> 03:37:35,450
Or is she getting more and more brazen...

4642
03:37:35,450 --> 03:37:36,170
every time she dies?

4643
03:37:36,970 --> 03:37:38,230
Well, that's because I'm a detective.

4644
03:37:38,230 --> 03:37:39,650
Have to be tough, you know.

4645
03:37:40,850 --> 03:37:41,790
Well, and...

4646
03:37:41,790 --> 03:37:42,590
How did it go?

4647
03:37:43,110 --> 03:37:45,610
Did you check out tomorrow's work schedule for prisoner D99?

4648
03:37:45,970 --> 03:37:46,330
Uh oh.

4649
03:37:47,530 --> 03:37:48,710
Yeah, just like I promised.

4650
03:37:49,670 --> 03:37:51,290
Actually, I have a few things I want to ask...

4651
03:37:51,290 --> 03:37:52,770
I want to ask you about too.

4652
03:37:53,650 --> 03:37:54,050
Sure!

4653
03:37:54,110 --> 03:37:56,390
We agree to use each other after all, right?

4654
03:37:57,610 --> 03:37:58,410
The troublesome...

4655
03:37:58,410 --> 03:37:59,430
GF experience?

4656
03:38:01,390 --> 03:38:03,790
Oh, no British accent?

4657
03:38:03,990 --> 03:38:04,230
Oh, sorry.

4658
03:38:05,490 --> 03:38:05,990
Okay.

4659
03:38:06,170 --> 03:38:07,290
Let's swap info then.

4660
03:38:13,750 --> 03:38:16,210
Let's save my murderer for last, right?

4661
03:38:18,390 --> 03:38:19,430
Let's start with point...

4662
03:38:19,430 --> 03:38:21,070
We'll work our way up.

4663
03:38:21,230 --> 03:38:21,750
Point X.

4664
03:38:22,470 --> 03:38:24,570
The police were staking this restaurant out tonight.

4665
03:38:25,150 --> 03:38:26,590
They called it Point X.

4666
03:38:27,990 --> 03:38:28,970
Point X, huh?

4667
03:38:29,210 --> 03:38:30,610
That's a good name for this place.

4668
03:38:31,410 --> 03:38:34,590
That white suited inspector was in surprise to find out...

4669
03:38:34,590 --> 03:38:36,150
you just casually waltzed in here.

4670
03:38:38,450 --> 03:38:39,250
Inspector Cabanela?

4671
03:38:41,330 --> 03:38:43,370
What in the world made you pick this place anyway?

4672
03:38:44,170 --> 03:38:45,490
I guess I'd have to say...

4673
03:38:45,490 --> 03:38:46,070
because of you.

4674
03:38:46,910 --> 03:38:47,310
Me?

4675
03:38:47,770 --> 03:38:48,710
What did I do?

4676
03:38:49,650 --> 03:38:51,510
Every time she dies, she gets a new accent.

4677
03:38:54,550 --> 03:38:56,850
She dies as much as Maya gets arrested...

4678
03:38:56,850 --> 03:38:58,230
in Ace Attorney?

4679
03:38:58,450 --> 03:38:58,790
So true.

4680
03:39:01,270 --> 03:39:03,110
You remember that note I found?

4681
03:39:04,330 --> 03:39:06,030
The note I didn't get a chance to read.

4682
03:39:06,810 --> 03:39:07,690
The note I didn't get a chance to read.

4683
03:39:07,690 --> 03:39:08,690
She sent a time written on it.

4684
03:39:08,710 --> 03:39:10,390
The chicken kitchen, 10pm.

4685
03:39:12,250 --> 03:39:13,630
In other words...

4686
03:39:13,630 --> 03:39:15,310
I was supposed to meet...

4687
03:39:15,310 --> 03:39:16,350
somebody here tonight.

4688
03:39:20,070 --> 03:39:21,290
Yup, apparently so.

4689
03:39:22,090 --> 03:39:23,730
I just had to get that information...

4690
03:39:23,730 --> 03:39:24,870
you were going to give me.

4691
03:39:25,470 --> 03:39:27,150
Or I just had to get that information...

4692
03:39:27,150 --> 03:39:27,910
you were going to give me.

4693
03:39:28,330 --> 03:39:29,310
That's why I came here.

4694
03:39:29,530 --> 03:39:31,170
It was the only lead I had left.

4695
03:39:32,850 --> 03:39:33,250
Ahhhh...

4696
03:39:34,890 --> 03:39:36,570
So this here is Point X.

4697
03:39:37,690 --> 03:39:37,810
That's mean.

4698
03:39:38,430 --> 03:39:41,530
The mark the police were waiting for was mean?

4699
03:39:52,370 --> 03:39:54,830
I feel like the music is a little too light-hearted...

4700
03:39:54,830 --> 03:39:55,630
for what's going on.

4701
03:39:56,210 --> 03:39:58,650
Just like you said, each prisoner had a little blackboard...

4702
03:39:58,650 --> 03:39:59,050
in his cell.

4703
03:39:59,390 --> 03:40:01,010
But the thing is...

4704
03:40:01,010 --> 03:40:04,630
there wasn't anything written on Prisoner D99's blackboard.

4705
03:40:04,870 --> 03:40:05,850
It was blank.

4706
03:40:07,070 --> 03:40:07,590
What?

4707
03:40:08,530 --> 03:40:10,710
I guess maybe it means his schedule for tomorrow...

4708
03:40:10,710 --> 03:40:11,750
hasn't been decided yet?

4709
03:40:13,710 --> 03:40:14,230
Blank?

4710
03:40:14,610 --> 03:40:15,130
Huh?

4711
03:40:20,020 --> 03:40:21,140
I didn't lose it over a blank blackboard.

4712
03:40:22,320 --> 03:40:24,600
How come you're so upset about an undecided work schedule?

4713
03:40:25,420 --> 03:40:26,220
Oh man...

4714
03:40:27,580 --> 03:40:28,820
I get the feeling that...

4715
03:40:28,820 --> 03:40:30,080
back when I was alive...

4716
03:40:30,080 --> 03:40:32,060
I never had much of a schedule to worry about myself.

4717
03:40:32,860 --> 03:40:33,980
Do you know what it means...

4718
03:40:33,980 --> 03:40:35,980
when a prisoner doesn't have a schedule for the next day?

4719
03:40:37,460 --> 03:40:38,440
It means something?

4720
03:40:38,720 --> 03:40:39,300
Oh gosh.

4721
03:40:39,740 --> 03:40:40,320
Cecil please!

4722
03:40:42,660 --> 03:40:44,440
It doesn't mean he doesn't have work to do.

4723
03:40:44,720 --> 03:40:45,660
It's more like...

4724
03:40:45,660 --> 03:40:46,640
he can't work.

4725
03:40:46,640 --> 03:40:48,440
Because he's dead!

4726
03:40:49,780 --> 03:40:51,040
He's going to be...

4727
03:40:51,040 --> 03:40:51,580
executed!

4728
03:40:52,180 --> 03:40:52,780
Aha.

4729
03:40:55,040 --> 03:40:55,640
Executed?

4730
03:40:57,140 --> 03:40:57,920
Uh oh.

4731
03:40:58,200 --> 03:40:58,800
Oh!

4732
03:40:59,440 --> 03:41:00,040
Execution.

4733
03:41:01,860 --> 03:41:05,100
Do you know what Prisoner D99's crime was?

4734
03:41:05,680 --> 03:41:06,700
I think so.

4735
03:41:07,380 --> 03:41:08,800
They said something about him...

4736
03:41:08,800 --> 03:41:09,780
murdering his wife...

4737
03:41:09,780 --> 03:41:10,940
right in front of a family member.

4738
03:41:11,440 --> 03:41:12,040
Her.

4739
03:41:13,000 --> 03:41:14,100
That's what they say...

4740
03:41:14,100 --> 03:41:14,800
but it's not true.

4741
03:41:15,660 --> 03:41:16,860
He would never...

4742
03:41:16,860 --> 03:41:19,280
Detective Joud would never do anything like that!

4743
03:41:20,340 --> 03:41:21,560
The death penalty...

4744
03:41:21,560 --> 03:41:24,460
hasn't been enforced in this country for a very long time.

4745
03:41:24,700 --> 03:41:26,140
They're trying to get rid of him...

4746
03:41:26,140 --> 03:41:27,000
because he knows something.

4747
03:41:27,600 --> 03:41:28,660
Not for decades.

4748
03:41:29,580 --> 03:41:31,340
Even if the prisoner wants it.

4749
03:41:31,700 --> 03:41:32,800
Like in this case.

4750
03:41:34,100 --> 03:41:35,700
The prisoner wants it?

4751
03:41:37,000 --> 03:41:38,420
There's definitely something else...

4752
03:41:38,420 --> 03:41:39,380
going on with this case.

4753
03:41:39,580 --> 03:41:40,580
I just know it.

4754
03:41:42,040 --> 03:41:43,220
And I have to find out what.

4755
03:41:45,600 --> 03:41:47,780
And if his work schedule is blank for tomorrow...

4756
03:41:47,780 --> 03:41:48,940
I have to do it right now!

4757
03:41:50,240 --> 03:41:52,200
So this Prisoner D99...

4758
03:41:52,200 --> 03:41:53,520
Detective Joud...

4759
03:41:54,040 --> 03:41:55,880
He must be connected to me in some way too.

4760
03:41:57,380 --> 03:42:00,040
Are we not going to mention that he had me drawn on his...

4761
03:42:00,040 --> 03:42:00,720
little... yeah.

4762
03:42:01,340 --> 03:42:02,040
Look at that.

4763
03:42:02,180 --> 03:42:02,720
It's beautiful.

4764
03:42:03,100 --> 03:42:04,820
Captures my best side and everything.

4765
03:42:07,120 --> 03:42:09,220
After all, he obviously knows me.

4766
03:42:14,850 --> 03:42:16,210
At last, my murderer.

4767
03:42:18,270 --> 03:42:19,490
On my way here...

4768
03:42:19,490 --> 03:42:21,570
I stopped by the Chief of Police's office.

4769
03:42:23,470 --> 03:42:24,850
Do you think he has a skip?

4770
03:42:26,950 --> 03:42:27,350
Oh...

4771
03:42:27,350 --> 03:42:29,230
It was just on your way, was it?

4772
03:42:30,030 --> 03:42:31,910
And while I was there, I saw who did it.

4773
03:42:32,050 --> 03:42:33,270
I saw my murderer.

4774
03:42:33,990 --> 03:42:34,770
You saw him?

4775
03:42:35,090 --> 03:42:35,490
Where?

4776
03:42:35,650 --> 03:42:35,830
How?

4777
03:42:36,810 --> 03:42:37,530
Not him.

4778
03:42:37,890 --> 03:42:38,290
Her.

4779
03:42:38,770 --> 03:42:40,890
There was a security camera set up there...

4780
03:42:40,890 --> 03:42:42,070
at the junkyard where I got shot.

4781
03:42:42,070 --> 03:42:44,410
The security tape showed me...

4782
03:42:44,410 --> 03:42:45,230
the person who shot me.

4783
03:42:45,970 --> 03:42:46,970
It was you.

4784
03:42:48,110 --> 03:42:50,490
And it was not AI generated.

4785
03:42:55,090 --> 03:42:55,650
Flashback...

4786
03:42:55,650 --> 03:42:57,650
Were we possessed by the lamp?

4787
03:42:58,290 --> 03:43:00,390
Was she possessed by the lamp maybe?

4788
03:43:01,230 --> 03:43:02,350
No way...

4789
03:43:02,350 --> 03:43:03,890
You're kidding, right?

4790
03:43:05,650 --> 03:43:07,550
What do you have to say for yourself, detective?

4791
03:43:09,970 --> 03:43:10,950
It wasn't me!

4792
03:43:11,130 --> 03:43:12,050
I didn't shoot!

4793
03:43:13,310 --> 03:43:16,530
If I recall, this is what you said about who shot me.

4794
03:43:16,610 --> 03:43:16,810
If I recall, this is what you said about who shot me.

4795
03:43:17,090 --> 03:43:19,670
My memory just isn't clear on that part.

4796
03:43:20,550 --> 03:43:23,010
So how can you say for sure that it wasn't you?

4797
03:43:24,150 --> 03:43:25,850
B-because I told you before!

4798
03:43:26,690 --> 03:43:28,550
You were supposed to give me some information!

4799
03:43:29,550 --> 03:43:30,550
The lamp?

4800
03:43:30,810 --> 03:43:31,330
Yeah...

4801
03:43:31,990 --> 03:43:33,070
The lamp...

4802
03:43:33,070 --> 03:43:34,430
Information, huh?

4803
03:43:34,970 --> 03:43:37,490
Maybe that information was the reason you shot me.

4804
03:43:38,050 --> 03:43:38,570
What?

4805
03:43:38,790 --> 03:43:39,550
What do you mean?

4806
03:43:40,910 --> 03:43:41,750
Ba-ding!

4807
03:43:42,070 --> 03:43:44,230
Why she shot me...

4808
03:43:45,690 --> 03:43:46,990
What's the chat summary?

4809
03:43:53,490 --> 03:43:56,110
You said you had some information on the case I'm looking into.

4810
03:43:57,070 --> 03:44:00,630
So I would hardly shoot you before I even heard that information, right?

4811
03:44:01,550 --> 03:44:02,070
So I would hardly shoot you before I even heard that information, right?

4812
03:44:02,070 --> 03:44:02,370
I agree.

4813
03:44:03,090 --> 03:44:04,570
That wouldn't make sense.

4814
03:44:04,890 --> 03:44:07,550
If it was before...

4815
03:44:07,550 --> 03:44:08,250
Huh?

4816
03:44:10,130 --> 03:44:13,790
But what if it was after you already got the information from me?

4817
03:44:14,430 --> 03:44:14,530
But what if it was after you already got the information from me?

4818
03:44:15,210 --> 03:44:17,310
Bum-bum-ba-bum-bum-bum.

4819
03:44:19,770 --> 03:44:21,050
Oh, she looks shocked.

4820
03:44:21,250 --> 03:44:23,190
I definitely told you something then.

4821
03:44:25,850 --> 03:44:26,850
I killed...

4822
03:44:26,850 --> 03:44:28,250
...the lady.

4823
03:44:28,910 --> 03:44:30,070
She's like, no, you...

4824
03:44:30,070 --> 03:44:30,270
No.

4825
03:44:31,310 --> 03:44:33,830
And whatever it was, it really shocked you.

4826
03:44:33,990 --> 03:44:35,270
What did I tell you?

4827
03:44:37,270 --> 03:44:38,310
I don't remember.

4828
03:44:38,450 --> 03:44:38,910
I don't know!

4829
03:44:39,110 --> 03:44:40,530
You've got to believe me!

4830
03:44:41,910 --> 03:44:44,870
After you saved me, I thought I got all of my memories back.

4831
03:44:44,870 --> 03:44:47,250
But maybe I really didn't.

4832
03:44:47,570 --> 03:44:49,330
I killed Bufasa.

4833
03:44:49,550 --> 03:44:51,050
I am your father.

4834
03:44:51,230 --> 03:44:51,690
Luke.

4835
03:44:53,090 --> 03:44:54,210
You told me something.

4836
03:44:54,270 --> 03:44:55,610
I can't remember that part at all.

4837
03:44:56,030 --> 03:44:57,070
Because we were possessed.

4838
03:44:58,090 --> 03:45:00,170
You got the information you wanted from me.

4839
03:45:00,210 --> 03:45:01,150
And then you shot me.

4840
03:45:02,350 --> 03:45:03,470
Isn't that what happened?

4841
03:45:04,510 --> 03:45:06,210
No, no, I didn't shoot you!

4842
03:45:08,010 --> 03:45:08,890
Please tell me.

4843
03:45:09,030 --> 03:45:10,710
What did you tell me that time?

4844
03:45:10,990 --> 03:45:11,350
How am I...

4845
03:45:11,350 --> 03:45:12,730
You know I have no memories.

4846
03:45:14,870 --> 03:45:15,370
I can't even read!

4847
03:45:16,230 --> 03:45:17,590
What did I learn from you?

4848
03:45:21,190 --> 03:45:22,890
So, what are you going to do now?

4849
03:45:24,390 --> 03:45:26,170
I mean, you fulfilled your goal, right?

4850
03:45:26,890 --> 03:45:28,230
You found out who shot you.

4851
03:45:30,470 --> 03:45:31,710
Are you going to get revenge?

4852
03:45:32,050 --> 03:45:33,390
That would be easy enough to do.

4853
03:45:34,170 --> 03:45:35,650
All you have to do is not save me.

4854
03:45:37,150 --> 03:45:37,550
Oh...

4855
03:45:38,030 --> 03:45:39,270
It's kind of a dilemma, huh?

4856
03:45:43,230 --> 03:45:44,670
If I don't save her...

4857
03:45:45,550 --> 03:45:45,970
Um...

4858
03:45:46,670 --> 03:45:49,750
You know, I end the game in this stream.

4859
03:45:51,930 --> 03:45:53,770
Is this the ending I was hoping for?

4860
03:45:54,070 --> 03:45:54,170
Is this the ending I was hoping for?

4861
03:45:55,230 --> 03:45:57,630
Had I unraveled all of the mysteries of me?

4862
03:45:57,730 --> 03:45:57,790
Had I unraveled all of the mysteries of me?

4863
03:45:57,790 --> 03:46:01,390
Gosh, I can see why so many people say this is their favorite game ever.

4864
03:46:01,630 --> 03:46:01,710
Gosh, I can see why so many people say this is their favorite game ever.

4865
03:46:01,710 --> 03:46:02,990
It just ends like that!

4866
03:46:05,470 --> 03:46:06,050
That's it!

4867
03:46:06,110 --> 03:46:06,850
That's the story!

4868
03:46:07,830 --> 03:46:09,050
What am I going to do now?

4869
03:46:09,250 --> 03:46:10,810
I'm going to save you, that's what.

4870
03:46:11,630 --> 03:46:12,230
You are?

4871
03:46:12,230 --> 03:46:14,850
I want to know everything.

4872
03:46:15,550 --> 03:46:16,510
Who I was.

4873
03:46:16,590 --> 03:46:17,550
Why I was killed.

4874
03:46:19,570 --> 03:46:21,530
Yeah, I'd like to know who those guys are too.

4875
03:46:21,650 --> 03:46:22,930
The little blue guys.

4876
03:46:22,990 --> 03:46:23,530
And the grapes.

4877
03:46:25,970 --> 03:46:26,910
I want answers.

4878
03:46:26,970 --> 03:46:28,150
And I'm going to find them.

4879
03:46:29,170 --> 03:46:30,890
But to do that, I'm going to need your help.

4880
03:46:32,810 --> 03:46:33,210
Okay.

4881
03:46:33,610 --> 03:46:34,830
I won't say thank you.

4882
03:46:35,050 --> 03:46:35,650
Not yet.

4883
03:46:36,210 --> 03:46:37,790
And I won't say I'm sorry either.

4884
03:46:38,190 --> 03:46:41,170
But I'll help see to it that you get your answers.

4885
03:46:41,810 --> 03:46:42,210
But I'll help see to it that you get your answers.

4886
03:46:42,230 --> 03:46:42,710
Good.

4887
03:46:43,670 --> 03:46:46,170
Now I think it's time to go back to the past.

4888
03:46:46,710 --> 03:46:50,710
I can't leave you lying flattened under a huge chunk of chicken forever after all.

4889
03:46:55,010 --> 03:46:58,760
Alrighty, guys.

4890
03:46:58,880 --> 03:47:00,700
Let's solve this chicken dinner.

4891
03:47:03,480 --> 03:47:04,800
Let's cook this roast.

4892
03:47:05,120 --> 03:47:05,660
I mean...

4893
03:47:06,940 --> 03:47:08,340
Let's prep this roast.

4894
03:47:08,960 --> 03:47:11,420
The note says the chicken kitchen, 10pm.

4895
03:47:12,180 --> 03:47:15,600
I wonder if that pointy haired man was going to meet here.

4896
03:47:16,280 --> 03:47:17,380
You know my name.

4897
03:47:17,400 --> 03:47:18,200
You know I'm Sissel.

4898
03:47:19,680 --> 03:47:20,260
What's this?

4899
03:47:20,800 --> 03:47:21,560
Today's special.

4900
03:47:26,220 --> 03:47:27,560
Oh my gosh.

4901
03:47:27,620 --> 03:47:28,880
She's so cute.

4902
03:47:31,620 --> 03:47:32,500
She's so...

4903
03:47:32,500 --> 03:47:33,780
Whoa, I thought...

4904
03:47:33,780 --> 03:47:34,540
Oh my gosh.

4905
03:47:34,580 --> 03:47:36,640
I thought that was like an alien lady for a second.

4906
03:47:39,720 --> 03:47:40,560
Bing bong.

4907
03:47:41,160 --> 03:47:43,960
I don't think she fits the vibe of this restaurant.

4908
03:47:44,520 --> 03:47:45,520
I love it though.

4909
03:47:50,870 --> 03:47:51,410
Can...

4910
03:47:51,410 --> 03:47:55,070
Yeah, can someone convince Kiara to get a skater outfit like that next?

4911
03:47:56,730 --> 03:47:58,790
Can someone please convince her?

4912
03:47:58,990 --> 03:48:00,010
We need like a...

4913
03:48:00,010 --> 03:48:01,030
Can I eat that thing?

4914
03:48:01,190 --> 03:48:02,190
Oh my gosh, Lin, please.

4915
03:48:08,420 --> 03:48:08,960
Whoa!

4916
03:48:10,500 --> 03:48:11,400
Oh my god.

4917
03:48:13,580 --> 03:48:14,120
No!

4918
03:48:16,420 --> 03:48:17,300
Oh my god.

4919
03:48:18,160 --> 03:48:18,700
Phew!

4920
03:48:22,880 --> 03:48:23,840
Lin's got moves.

4921
03:48:24,040 --> 03:48:24,480
Yeah, she do.

4922
03:48:25,880 --> 03:48:29,040
You're just going bigger and better with each new death, aren't you?

4923
03:48:29,980 --> 03:48:30,700
Leave me alone.

4924
03:48:30,980 --> 03:48:33,800
Can I help it if I got tired of dying the usual ways?

4925
03:48:34,180 --> 03:48:36,060
You could have just moved, Lin.

4926
03:48:36,120 --> 03:48:36,960
You could have just moved.

4927
03:48:37,720 --> 03:48:38,480
But I'll say this.

4928
03:48:38,740 --> 03:48:40,920
It was a death any detective could be proud of.

4929
03:48:41,760 --> 03:48:42,120
Huh?

4930
03:48:42,260 --> 03:48:43,180
What makes you say that?

4931
03:48:43,400 --> 03:48:44,480
Because you saved her.

4932
03:48:44,660 --> 03:48:47,300
You saved a girl the way you save someone else before dying yourself.

4933
03:48:48,360 --> 03:48:49,220
Oh, that waitress?

4934
03:48:49,360 --> 03:48:50,700
The one with the chicken on her head?

4935
03:48:51,060 --> 03:48:56,380
The next time you put a chicken on your head, you should try one about the size of the waitress's.

4936
03:48:57,460 --> 03:48:59,060
I'll make a note of that for next time.

4937
03:49:00,600 --> 03:49:01,360
But anyway...

4938
03:49:02,220 --> 03:49:05,340
If you hadn't tried to save that waitress, you'd still be alive.

4939
03:49:06,000 --> 03:49:06,560
No, no.

4940
03:49:06,680 --> 03:49:08,600
We're not choosing lives here.

4941
03:49:09,180 --> 03:49:10,260
I couldn't help it.

4942
03:49:10,320 --> 03:49:11,880
You know, the detective thing and all.

4943
03:49:12,520 --> 03:49:15,000
I wasn't able to save that poor van driver, though.

4944
03:49:15,140 --> 03:49:16,740
I don't think there's no helping that guy.

4945
03:49:17,340 --> 03:49:19,440
At the speed, he must have died instantly.

4946
03:49:19,440 --> 03:49:23,640
Well, we can't let a heroic detective like you stay dead.

4947
03:49:23,840 --> 03:49:25,980
The root of this whole disaster is clear.

4948
03:49:26,180 --> 03:49:26,680
Chicken.

4949
03:49:27,380 --> 03:49:28,960
The question is...

4950
03:49:28,960 --> 03:49:30,260
How do I stop it?

4951
03:49:31,100 --> 03:49:32,700
Okay, let's get started!

4952
03:49:35,020 --> 03:49:35,680
Hmm...

4953
03:49:40,670 --> 03:49:41,330
Uh...

4954
03:49:42,690 --> 03:49:44,010
Trick time...

4955
03:49:45,070 --> 03:49:45,730
Okay...

4956
03:49:45,730 --> 03:49:47,730
Menu board...

4957
03:49:48,410 --> 03:49:49,070
Sign...

4958
03:49:49,590 --> 03:49:50,690
Let's ring the bell!

4959
03:49:51,410 --> 03:49:51,770
Uh...

4960
03:49:51,770 --> 03:49:52,390
Trick.

4961
03:49:55,450 --> 03:49:56,470
Hello, ma'am!

4962
03:49:56,710 --> 03:49:58,110
Oh my god, she's so cute!

4963
03:49:59,710 --> 03:50:00,930
She's so cute!

4964
03:50:05,630 --> 03:50:06,350
You rang?

4965
03:50:07,750 --> 03:50:08,470
Oh, sorry.

4966
03:50:08,610 --> 03:50:09,490
I didn't ring the bell.

4967
03:50:10,550 --> 03:50:11,510
Okay, I get it.

4968
03:50:11,890 --> 03:50:13,650
This was a little dig, wasn't it?

4969
03:50:14,010 --> 03:50:16,150
Kind of like, hey, where's my food, right?

4970
03:50:17,070 --> 03:50:18,030
No, not at all!

4971
03:50:18,290 --> 03:50:19,610
Besides, I didn't ring it.

4972
03:50:20,690 --> 03:50:20,930
Oh, okay.

4973
03:50:21,310 --> 03:50:22,410
That's all right then.

4974
03:50:22,930 --> 03:50:25,650
But the chef is the one who makes the chicken.

4975
03:50:25,810 --> 03:50:27,950
No sense in harassing me about it, right?

4976
03:50:28,130 --> 03:50:28,530
No sense in harassing me about it, right?

4977
03:50:30,150 --> 03:50:31,610
Just keep that in mind, okay?

4978
03:50:33,310 --> 03:50:33,750
Bye!

4979
03:50:35,330 --> 03:50:36,110
Odd girl.

4980
03:50:36,490 --> 03:50:37,210
I agree.

4981
03:50:37,590 --> 03:50:38,290
Me too.

4982
03:50:39,610 --> 03:50:40,830
What's wrong with her?

4983
03:50:40,890 --> 03:50:41,590
She didn't do anything.

4984
03:50:41,790 --> 03:50:42,110
What's this?

4985
03:50:43,450 --> 03:50:44,270
It's no use.

4986
03:50:44,330 --> 03:50:45,310
I can't read what it says.

4987
03:50:45,550 --> 03:50:46,110
Oh, let's see.

4988
03:50:47,370 --> 03:50:48,730
Now I remember what the sign says.

4989
03:50:50,690 --> 03:50:52,850
Please ring the bell three times.

4990
03:50:53,950 --> 03:50:54,390
Okay.

4991
03:50:55,070 --> 03:50:57,970
The waitress doesn't bring any water if you only ring the bell once.

4992
03:50:58,270 --> 03:50:59,850
She said those are the rules apparently.

4993
03:51:00,330 --> 03:51:01,250
I said apparently?

4994
03:51:01,510 --> 03:51:02,310
What do you mean apparently?

4995
03:51:02,530 --> 03:51:03,270
Don't you work here?

4996
03:51:04,150 --> 03:51:06,090
Quite a stickler for the details, this detective.

4997
03:51:07,470 --> 03:51:07,910
Okay.

4998
03:51:08,430 --> 03:51:09,310
So let's...

4999
03:51:14,550 --> 03:51:15,850
You wrote this note, right?

5000
03:51:16,590 --> 03:51:18,530
I think so, but I don't remember.

5001
03:51:21,250 --> 03:51:21,990
10 o'clock.

5002
03:51:22,170 --> 03:51:24,830
That means it's already time for your meeting with whoever it is.

5003
03:51:25,210 --> 03:51:26,350
Now that I think about it.

5004
03:51:26,770 --> 03:51:29,330
Whoever you were supposed to meet might already be here.

5005
03:51:29,950 --> 03:51:31,370
You think the detective...

5006
03:51:31,890 --> 03:51:32,770
You're the detective.

5007
03:51:33,350 --> 03:51:33,750
Whoa.

5008
03:51:34,010 --> 03:51:35,070
I can't read anymore.

5009
03:51:35,510 --> 03:51:37,230
Shouldn't you have checked out when you got here?

5010
03:51:38,390 --> 03:51:40,610
Sorry, the chicken at this restaurant is really good.

5011
03:51:40,850 --> 03:51:41,630
So, you know.

5012
03:51:43,490 --> 03:51:44,630
No, I don't know.

5013
03:51:45,130 --> 03:51:46,810
Take a look around the rest of the restaurant.

5014
03:51:50,130 --> 03:51:50,650
Okay.

5015
03:51:50,910 --> 03:51:52,310
We're zooming around.

5016
03:51:53,570 --> 03:51:54,090
Wow.

5017
03:51:55,390 --> 03:51:56,330
That's fancy.

5018
03:51:58,130 --> 03:51:59,590
But there's these guys.

5019
03:52:00,770 --> 03:52:01,890
Time is passing.

5020
03:52:04,010 --> 03:52:05,010
And then her.

5021
03:52:05,630 --> 03:52:07,170
Aren't you going to deliver my food?

5022
03:52:07,290 --> 03:52:08,850
The chicken is just sitting there.

5023
03:52:10,630 --> 03:52:12,370
What are you doing with that?

5024
03:52:15,470 --> 03:52:16,590
Okay, we hit it.

5025
03:52:16,810 --> 03:52:17,250
Three times.

5026
03:52:17,630 --> 03:52:18,730
Give me my water.

5027
03:52:19,490 --> 03:52:20,450
Thank you, ma'am.

5028
03:52:20,630 --> 03:52:21,110
Water.

5029
03:52:25,070 --> 03:52:26,830
You want more water?

5030
03:52:30,090 --> 03:52:31,570
I stay hydrated.

5031
03:52:31,670 --> 03:52:32,470
What's your issue?

5032
03:52:33,210 --> 03:52:34,470
Sorry, I didn't ring the bell.

5033
03:52:34,930 --> 03:52:36,970
And what's with the more water bit?

5034
03:52:37,690 --> 03:52:38,970
Oh, well, come on.

5035
03:52:39,030 --> 03:52:40,050
This is your third glass.

5036
03:52:40,790 --> 03:52:41,790
Okay, I get it.

5037
03:52:41,810 --> 03:52:43,090
This was a little dig, wasn't it?

5038
03:52:43,170 --> 03:52:44,410
Oh, where's my food?

5039
03:52:48,170 --> 03:52:50,010
I'll see you bringing me my chicken soon.

5040
03:52:50,670 --> 03:52:51,490
Duly noted.

5041
03:52:51,930 --> 03:52:54,370
In the meantime, enjoy a nice glass of water.

5042
03:52:57,130 --> 03:52:58,090
Thank you.

5043
03:52:59,950 --> 03:53:00,750
Odd girl.

5044
03:53:00,930 --> 03:53:01,550
I agree.

5045
03:53:01,790 --> 03:53:02,470
I agree.

5046
03:53:04,590 --> 03:53:05,070
Okay.

5047
03:53:06,190 --> 03:53:07,330
What do they say?

5048
03:53:08,630 --> 03:53:10,190
What's taking my chicken so long?

5049
03:53:10,530 --> 03:53:14,410
Fortunately for you, according to what we saw before, the van arrives before your chicken's done.

5050
03:53:15,290 --> 03:53:17,770
In any case, just hanging around here isn't going to fix anything.

5051
03:53:18,170 --> 03:53:19,830
I'll have to look for a way to get beyond this area.

5052
03:53:20,150 --> 03:53:22,150
Oh, when she comes over, I have to...

5053
03:53:22,150 --> 03:53:24,330
One, two, three...

5054
03:53:24,330 --> 03:53:26,450
Sorry, I'm bullying her a little bit.

5055
03:53:26,730 --> 03:53:28,410
I'm harassing the...

5056
03:53:32,670 --> 03:53:33,750
There we go.

5057
03:53:37,410 --> 03:53:38,130
Thank you.

5058
03:53:41,030 --> 03:53:41,550
Alrighty.

5059
03:53:44,910 --> 03:53:45,430
Nice.

5060
03:53:46,890 --> 03:53:47,710
Trick time.

5061
03:53:49,850 --> 03:53:50,230
Uh...

5062
03:53:51,010 --> 03:53:52,110
To the cart!

5063
03:53:53,890 --> 03:53:54,270
And...

5064
03:53:54,270 --> 03:53:55,170
There it is.

5065
03:53:55,310 --> 03:53:56,830
I was like, are we going to go up?

5066
03:53:57,490 --> 03:53:58,590
Time is passing.

5067
03:54:00,970 --> 03:54:02,450
Do you think this girl likes her job?

5068
03:54:03,390 --> 03:54:07,230
I think if I could rollerblade everywhere, I would be very excited about that.

5069
03:54:07,410 --> 03:54:08,170
Oh wait, what did he say?

5070
03:54:08,290 --> 03:54:08,930
Here you go.

5071
03:54:10,490 --> 03:54:11,670
That's a big trunk.

5072
03:54:14,170 --> 03:54:15,750
This is one big trunk.

5073
03:54:16,130 --> 03:54:17,350
Seems pretty heavy too.

5074
03:54:18,690 --> 03:54:19,830
It's very suspicious.

5075
03:54:20,210 --> 03:54:21,030
And red.

5076
03:54:21,330 --> 03:54:22,850
My body is in there!

5077
03:54:23,310 --> 03:54:24,310
Let's see what's in it.

5078
03:54:24,950 --> 03:54:26,370
Sorry, but that's not possible.

5079
03:54:26,610 --> 03:54:27,490
It's locked.

5080
03:54:28,430 --> 03:54:28,910
Darn.

5081
03:54:29,030 --> 03:54:30,090
I wanted to see what was inside.

5082
03:54:32,210 --> 03:54:34,830
Okay, now we can eavesdrop on these guys.

5083
03:54:37,830 --> 03:54:39,870
So what do you think, my dear beauty?

5084
03:54:40,350 --> 03:54:43,210
Do you really think we can trust this deal?

5085
03:54:44,150 --> 03:54:44,910
Who knows?

5086
03:54:45,270 --> 03:54:47,130
It's not our job to think about that.

5087
03:54:47,710 --> 03:54:52,010
But those incidents did happen in this country, just as he predicted.

5088
03:54:52,830 --> 03:54:56,550
Yes, and they were pretty amusing too, weren't they?

5089
03:54:57,470 --> 03:55:03,110
That fellow who sang out national secrets during live TV broadcasts.

5090
03:55:03,250 --> 03:55:09,070
And the man who laid siege to the Metro Police Department, taking the top dog hostage.

5091
03:55:10,270 --> 03:55:13,990
Well, what if he double-crosses us?

5092
03:55:14,110 --> 03:55:15,730
It wouldn't be pretty.

5093
03:55:37,410 --> 03:55:39,210
How do these two...

5094
03:55:40,110 --> 03:55:43,090
How do they know about the cases at the special prison?

5095
03:55:43,090 --> 03:55:43,710
Yeah.

5096
03:55:44,270 --> 03:55:46,630
That guy's voice is so...

5097
03:55:46,630 --> 03:55:48,430
I know, right?

5098
03:55:50,850 --> 03:55:52,170
Great voice acting.

5099
03:55:52,710 --> 03:55:53,630
Thank you.

5100
03:55:53,670 --> 03:55:54,250
Thank you.

5101
03:56:03,890 --> 03:56:06,750
Well, wouldn't everyone know about the secrets?

5102
03:56:06,870 --> 03:56:08,730
Because it happened at a concert?

5103
03:56:09,770 --> 03:56:10,450
Like...

5104
03:56:16,760 --> 03:56:17,400
One of those cases...

5105
03:56:17,400 --> 03:56:18,720
And recently, too.

5106
03:56:19,640 --> 03:56:23,020
The perpetrators in those cases are being held at a special facility.

5107
03:56:25,320 --> 03:56:26,800
That's what the special prison is.

5108
03:56:26,920 --> 03:56:28,980
But it's not known about it by the general public.

5109
03:56:30,480 --> 03:56:34,400
So Prisoner D-99, Detective Jowd is one of these special cases, too, huh?

5110
03:56:37,740 --> 03:56:38,380
Oh, they...

5111
03:56:38,380 --> 03:56:39,120
It's a cover-up.

5112
03:56:39,360 --> 03:56:41,700
They erase the concert-goers' memories?

5113
03:56:41,860 --> 03:56:43,380
They have the power to do that?

5114
03:56:43,720 --> 03:56:45,200
They silence the crowd?

5115
03:56:48,920 --> 03:56:51,980
These two are talking about the very same cases I heard about just tonight.

5116
03:56:52,260 --> 03:56:52,720
How convenient.

5117
03:56:52,940 --> 03:56:54,320
Also, this guy's, like...

5118
03:56:55,640 --> 03:56:57,680
Margarita glass head is crazy.

5119
03:56:59,820 --> 03:57:01,780
That couldn't be just a coincidence, could it?

5120
03:57:08,160 --> 03:57:09,980
Is that a whip she's holding?

5121
03:57:10,280 --> 03:57:11,200
Or is that a...

5122
03:57:11,200 --> 03:57:11,980
That's not a cane.

5123
03:57:14,680 --> 03:57:16,340
What is her beauty?

5124
03:57:18,320 --> 03:57:19,160
What is her beauty?

5125
03:57:19,160 --> 03:57:20,220
Why don't we move to a different spot?

5126
03:57:23,460 --> 03:57:24,100
Waiter?

5127
03:57:24,160 --> 03:57:25,660
All the way over there.

5128
03:57:26,500 --> 03:57:28,500
That table in the back looks good.

5129
03:57:30,740 --> 03:57:34,200
Oh, now you're talking beauty, my dear.

5130
03:57:34,880 --> 03:57:37,160
Just what I've been waiting for.

5131
03:57:37,900 --> 03:57:40,240
A quiet, secluded spot.

5132
03:57:40,700 --> 03:57:42,500
Just the two of us.

5133
03:57:42,760 --> 03:57:44,780
I wouldn't object to that.

5134
03:57:44,780 --> 03:57:45,520
Well...

5135
03:57:46,840 --> 03:57:49,880
All of the sudden, I get this feeling somebody is...

5136
03:57:50,740 --> 03:57:51,380
eavesdropping.

5137
03:57:51,960 --> 03:57:54,800
My sixth sense is very strong, you know.

5138
03:57:57,800 --> 03:57:58,440
She...

5139
03:57:58,440 --> 03:57:59,760
Oh my god, she's noticing me?

5140
03:58:00,360 --> 03:58:01,400
Okay, beauty.

5141
03:58:02,820 --> 03:58:04,260
That's alright, my dear.

5142
03:58:04,500 --> 03:58:06,340
You don't have to make excuses.

5143
03:58:08,020 --> 03:58:11,360
Off we go across the bridge of poultry.

5144
03:58:11,500 --> 03:58:13,580
To the land of love.

5145
03:58:13,840 --> 03:58:14,240
To the land of love.

5146
03:58:15,400 --> 03:58:15,840
Wait!

5147
03:58:16,480 --> 03:58:17,260
Take the chicken!

5148
03:58:17,800 --> 03:58:18,620
No, no, no!

5149
03:58:21,340 --> 03:58:21,780
No!

5150
03:58:24,820 --> 03:58:26,780
Oh, we get to watch them...

5151
03:58:26,780 --> 03:58:27,480
Oh god!

5152
03:58:28,460 --> 03:58:29,340
God damn!

5153
03:58:32,340 --> 03:58:33,880
Stop with the super chat!

5154
03:58:34,000 --> 03:58:34,520
What does that mean?

5155
03:58:35,320 --> 03:58:36,200
What just happened?

5156
03:58:36,460 --> 03:58:37,600
Did she sense we were here?

5157
03:58:38,900 --> 03:58:39,340
What?

5158
03:58:39,440 --> 03:58:40,700
With her sixth sense?

5159
03:58:42,120 --> 03:58:44,420
But you know, I have some pretty amazing powers myself.

5160
03:58:45,380 --> 03:58:45,980
But you know, I have some pretty amazing powers myself.

5161
03:58:46,340 --> 03:58:46,480
Yeah?

5162
03:58:46,540 --> 03:58:47,160
Like what?

5163
03:58:48,400 --> 03:58:50,160
Like... like if there's chicken nearby.

5164
03:58:50,380 --> 03:58:51,460
I can tell right away.

5165
03:58:52,720 --> 03:58:54,380
That's called a sense of smell.

5166
03:58:55,100 --> 03:58:57,840
But anyway, at least the situation has changed a little bit now.

5167
03:58:59,600 --> 03:59:00,040
Fate...

5168
03:59:00,040 --> 03:59:00,760
Changed.

5169
03:59:03,760 --> 03:59:05,680
I don't believe in a sixth sense.

5170
03:59:05,800 --> 03:59:07,000
It's not scientific!

5171
03:59:09,540 --> 03:59:10,700
Says the ghost.

5172
03:59:11,680 --> 03:59:14,900
Come to think of it, we've been left behind, haven't we?

5173
03:59:14,940 --> 03:59:15,860
Yeah, we're kind of stuck here.

5174
03:59:16,340 --> 03:59:16,960
Looks that way.

5175
03:59:17,720 --> 03:59:20,620
Not having legs is even more inconvenient than I thought it would be.

5176
03:59:21,620 --> 03:59:22,940
What are we going to do now?

5177
03:59:23,460 --> 03:59:24,600
They're all the way over there!

5178
03:59:25,080 --> 03:59:27,220
I'm telling you, we'd better shake a leg.

5179
03:59:27,340 --> 03:59:28,920
We're going to miss what they're saying.

5180
03:59:30,440 --> 03:59:32,260
It'd be pretty hard to shake a leg.

5181
03:59:32,860 --> 03:59:34,080
Not having legs and all.

5182
03:59:35,460 --> 03:59:37,580
Oh my god, he's blowing kisses at her.

5183
03:59:38,180 --> 03:59:39,800
They're still talking about something.

5184
03:59:40,560 --> 03:59:41,840
I want to hear!

5185
03:59:42,660 --> 03:59:43,240
Me too.

5186
03:59:44,180 --> 03:59:45,340
Alright, let's figure what...

5187
03:59:46,340 --> 03:59:46,620
we're going to do in here.

5188
03:59:47,980 --> 03:59:50,400
Maybe they want a drink.

5189
03:59:51,440 --> 03:59:52,100
Right?

5190
03:59:52,580 --> 03:59:53,500
Can we...

5191
03:59:53,500 --> 03:59:55,520
We tried examining this and...

5192
03:59:56,310 --> 03:59:58,240
Okay, yeah, it's still the same thing.

5193
03:59:59,580 --> 04:00:00,240
Uh...

5194
04:00:01,300 --> 04:00:02,220
What is...

5195
04:00:02,220 --> 04:00:03,380
What if we dispense a bottle?

5196
04:00:03,780 --> 04:00:04,180
Oh!

5197
04:00:04,300 --> 04:00:04,840
Oh!

5198
04:00:04,980 --> 04:00:05,340
Oh!

5199
04:00:05,500 --> 04:00:05,960
Oh!

5200
04:00:06,160 --> 04:00:06,820
Oh!

5201
04:00:14,270 --> 04:00:14,930
Okay...

5202
04:00:14,930 --> 04:00:15,750
Um...

5203
04:00:18,730 --> 04:00:19,390
Uh...

5204
04:00:24,510 --> 04:00:26,410
She only comes for one bell here.

5205
04:00:28,690 --> 04:00:29,150
Wait!

5206
04:00:30,330 --> 04:00:30,790
Wait!

5207
04:00:30,810 --> 04:00:33,330
We make them a drink and she delivers it.

5208
04:00:36,070 --> 04:00:37,930
We make them a drink and she delivers it.

5209
04:00:38,350 --> 04:00:39,090
You're right.

5210
04:00:39,530 --> 04:00:40,490
Oh, I get it.

5211
04:00:40,530 --> 04:00:43,050
You saw that couple over there and you started to get lonely, right?

5212
04:00:43,470 --> 04:00:45,230
And so you decided to call me.

5213
04:00:45,570 --> 04:00:46,910
Oh, that's so sweet.

5214
04:00:47,690 --> 04:00:48,410
Forgive me.

5215
04:00:48,590 --> 04:00:50,090
But I didn't ring for anybody.

5216
04:00:51,110 --> 04:00:51,570
What?

5217
04:00:53,250 --> 04:00:54,470
Could you not stand in my light, please?

5218
04:00:54,590 --> 04:00:55,910
I can't see my glass properly.

5219
04:00:56,850 --> 04:00:58,510
I've been working here for two days.

5220
04:00:58,670 --> 04:01:01,070
And I've been waiting this whole time for you to notice me.

5221
04:01:01,510 --> 04:01:04,730
Now, would you stop trying to shake me up and just stick to shaking cocktails?

5222
04:01:07,890 --> 04:01:08,330
Okay.

5223
04:01:09,150 --> 04:01:12,050
Aww, she's heartbroken with her unrequited love.

5224
04:01:12,510 --> 04:01:14,930
She has a surprisingly short career with this place.

5225
04:01:15,930 --> 04:01:16,370
She has a surprisingly short career with this place.

5226
04:01:16,370 --> 04:01:16,410
Okay.

5227
04:01:22,340 --> 04:01:23,240
She's back already.

5228
04:01:23,240 --> 04:01:24,100
Oh, so fast.

5229
04:01:24,940 --> 04:01:26,080
Okay, trick time.

5230
04:01:28,040 --> 04:01:29,880
We're gonna make them a drink.

5231
04:01:33,850 --> 04:01:35,150
Oh, it just overflows!

5232
04:01:36,630 --> 04:01:37,870
Oh, I thought I could...

5233
04:01:37,870 --> 04:01:38,070
Okay.

5234
04:01:38,710 --> 04:01:42,790
I didn't realize it was going to be a cutscene.

5235
04:01:43,050 --> 04:01:46,970
I thought I would be able to ghost trick it to stop it.

5236
04:01:47,950 --> 04:01:49,270
You just broke that glass.

5237
04:01:49,530 --> 04:01:50,990
Just like you did my heart.

5238
04:01:51,530 --> 04:01:54,870
A broken glass can never be put back to stock.

5239
04:01:54,870 --> 04:01:56,690
Just leave it there.

5240
04:01:57,330 --> 04:01:58,670
You can't just leave it!

5241
04:01:58,730 --> 04:01:59,670
Somebody might get hurt!

5242
04:02:03,190 --> 04:02:05,490
Doesn't this trunk belong to that couple over there?

5243
04:02:08,290 --> 04:02:12,370
The only things we're allowed customers to lose here are their cares.

5244
04:02:13,110 --> 04:02:15,630
Miss, please go and let them know about the trunk.

5245
04:02:15,770 --> 04:02:17,010
If you would be so kind.

5246
04:02:18,690 --> 04:02:19,910
How gallant of you.

5247
04:02:20,130 --> 04:02:21,970
I just might fall for you, you know.

5248
04:02:23,130 --> 04:02:23,610
Yippee!

5249
04:02:24,870 --> 04:02:24,870
Got it.

5250
04:02:24,970 --> 04:02:25,130
Okay.

5251
04:02:28,290 --> 04:02:29,410
Oh, odd girl.

5252
04:02:29,590 --> 04:02:30,230
I agree.

5253
04:02:30,750 --> 04:02:31,430
I agree.

5254
04:02:33,470 --> 04:02:34,190
I agree.

5255
04:02:35,090 --> 04:02:35,810
I agree.

5256
04:02:37,450 --> 04:02:37,810
I...

5257
04:02:38,810 --> 04:02:39,170
agree.

5258
04:02:39,450 --> 04:02:41,390
Wait, we have to wait for him to put the glass down, maybe.

5259
04:02:45,310 --> 04:02:45,670
Oh.

5260
04:02:46,270 --> 04:02:46,630
Wait.

5261
04:02:46,790 --> 04:02:47,310
Uh-oh.

5262
04:02:48,090 --> 04:02:48,750
Oh, there it is.

5263
04:02:48,830 --> 04:02:48,930
There.

5264
04:02:48,990 --> 04:02:49,670
Oh, not yet.

5265
04:02:49,750 --> 04:02:50,010
Not yet.

5266
04:02:50,050 --> 04:02:50,270
Almost.

5267
04:02:50,490 --> 04:02:51,190
There we go!

5268
04:02:51,310 --> 04:02:52,090
Oh my gosh, sorry.

5269
04:02:52,330 --> 04:02:54,150
For going back and forth so many times.

5270
04:02:56,150 --> 04:02:56,510
For going back and forth so many times.

5271
04:02:56,530 --> 04:02:56,850
Well, goodbye.

5272
04:02:58,350 --> 04:03:01,950
I've been working here for two days and I've had my eye on you the whole time.

5273
04:03:02,310 --> 04:03:05,030
I think this might be my last night working here though.

5274
04:03:05,050 --> 04:03:05,470
What?

5275
04:03:06,270 --> 04:03:07,190
It's been fun.

5276
04:03:07,550 --> 04:03:09,090
Wait, you just got here!

5277
04:03:11,090 --> 04:03:14,550
I guess she's leaving this place with her surprisingly short career intact.

5278
04:03:18,070 --> 04:03:19,090
Oh, here he comes.

5279
04:03:21,850 --> 04:03:27,910
Of all things to forget, it wouldn't have been pretty if I forgot this.

5280
04:03:29,610 --> 04:03:31,790
You know who I'm trying to channel?

5281
04:03:31,950 --> 04:03:32,590
Is um...

5282
04:03:33,890 --> 04:03:35,170
Thunderburger from...

5283
04:03:35,170 --> 04:03:37,330
from Over the Garden Wall.

5284
04:03:38,750 --> 04:03:41,590
I think that's who I'm trying to channel.

5285
04:03:44,750 --> 04:03:45,390
Alright.

5286
04:03:45,670 --> 04:03:47,010
Here we are, finally.

5287
04:03:48,470 --> 04:03:49,670
Not Shaggy?

5288
04:03:52,150 --> 04:03:54,190
Like Scooby-Doo Shaggy?

5289
04:03:55,030 --> 04:03:56,250
No, he's like...

5290
04:03:56,810 --> 04:03:57,250
Zoinks.

5291
04:04:00,390 --> 04:04:01,270
Like Scoob.

5292
04:04:01,750 --> 04:04:04,090
He's got like a totally different voice.

5293
04:04:06,590 --> 04:04:08,370
I thought it was Shaggy.

5294
04:04:10,330 --> 04:04:11,110
Not at all!

5295
04:04:20,150 --> 04:04:22,390
I feel kind of bad about eavesdropping though.

5296
04:04:22,490 --> 04:04:22,950
I don't.

5297
04:04:23,630 --> 04:04:24,190
Not me.

5298
04:04:24,430 --> 04:04:24,750
Yeah.

5299
04:04:24,970 --> 04:04:25,950
I'm on Lin's side.

5300
04:04:26,130 --> 04:04:28,430
I mean, we just delivered their lost truck to them after all.

5301
04:04:28,570 --> 04:04:30,070
They owe us at least that much.

5302
04:04:30,470 --> 04:04:32,810
What kind of detective says something like that?

5303
04:04:34,350 --> 04:04:35,310
Faith changed.

5304
04:04:36,670 --> 04:04:37,270
Uh...

5305
04:04:37,270 --> 04:04:39,330
So can we listen in on them?

5306
04:04:40,430 --> 04:04:41,030
Now?

5307
04:04:42,490 --> 04:04:43,090
Oh!

5308
04:04:43,410 --> 04:04:44,690
We can be flowers.

5309
04:04:45,370 --> 04:04:46,030
Oh, we can...

5310
04:04:47,690 --> 04:04:49,030
Let's swing a little bit.

5311
04:04:49,110 --> 04:04:49,730
Oh my god!

5312
04:04:52,470 --> 04:04:56,190
I can't believe I forgot the trunk of all things.

5313
04:04:56,190 --> 04:04:57,910
Now I'm hearing Shaggy.

5314
04:05:00,750 --> 04:05:04,310
With such a small body, you probably only have a small brain to match.

5315
04:05:05,350 --> 04:05:05,870
Ouch!

5316
04:05:05,890 --> 04:05:06,950
That hurts, beauty!

5317
04:05:07,330 --> 04:05:10,350
Now I can't do... Now I'm doing Scooby!

5318
04:05:10,550 --> 04:05:11,690
I mean Shaggy.

5319
04:05:12,890 --> 04:05:14,630
But like, that's okay.

5320
04:05:15,370 --> 04:05:17,310
That's what I love about you.

5321
04:05:19,810 --> 04:05:21,250
That's what he loves about her?

5322
04:05:21,350 --> 04:05:22,250
Oh my gosh, Lin.

5323
04:05:22,790 --> 04:05:23,850
Don't kink-shame.

5324
04:05:24,470 --> 04:05:25,590
I don't get it either.

5325
04:05:26,530 --> 04:05:28,170
Now where were we?

5326
04:05:28,390 --> 04:05:29,350
Oh, right.

5327
04:05:29,970 --> 04:05:31,550
To invite to the wedding.

5328
04:05:32,370 --> 04:05:35,450
If we got married, that is, of course.

5329
04:05:37,330 --> 04:05:38,090
Whip him.

5330
04:05:38,570 --> 04:05:41,190
She's like, I'm glad there's nobody around to listen to this.

5331
04:05:42,510 --> 04:05:44,810
We can talk about that when we're alone.

5332
04:05:46,070 --> 04:05:48,390
But aren't we alone now, beauty?

5333
04:05:49,570 --> 04:05:51,690
Do you think she senses our presence again?

5334
04:05:52,870 --> 04:05:54,830
I spy a ladybug.

5335
04:05:56,190 --> 04:05:56,970
Oh, ladybug.

5336
04:05:58,090 --> 04:05:59,990
I just hate little bugs.

5337
04:06:00,530 --> 04:06:01,270
Me too.

5338
04:06:03,610 --> 04:06:04,130
What?

5339
04:06:06,910 --> 04:06:07,430
What?

5340
04:06:12,320 --> 04:06:12,980
Uh-oh.

5341
04:06:13,900 --> 04:06:14,420
Uh...

5342
04:06:14,420 --> 04:06:16,500
Death is imminent, I suppose.

5343
04:06:18,220 --> 04:06:19,060
Death is...

5344
04:06:19,960 --> 04:06:21,920
After all that trouble, it happened anyway!

5345
04:06:22,760 --> 04:06:24,660
It looks that way, yes.

5346
04:06:25,140 --> 04:06:26,400
It's not over yet, though.

5347
04:06:26,940 --> 04:06:27,600
It's not?

5348
04:06:27,740 --> 04:06:28,440
What are you talking about?

5349
04:06:29,480 --> 04:06:30,480
You're not dead yet.

5350
04:06:32,140 --> 04:06:33,440
No, I'm just...

5351
04:06:33,440 --> 04:06:35,320
I'm going to be in just a few seconds.

5352
04:06:41,440 --> 04:06:45,400
But before that happens, maybe there's something we can do from here.

5353
04:06:46,640 --> 04:06:47,480
Trick time.

5354
04:06:48,500 --> 04:06:49,060
Okay.

5355
04:06:49,260 --> 04:06:49,820
Swing.

5356
04:06:51,260 --> 04:06:52,440
Oh, so close.

5357
04:06:52,620 --> 04:06:53,580
So close.

5358
04:06:55,080 --> 04:06:56,300
There we go.

5359
04:06:56,480 --> 04:06:57,340
Chicken bone.

5360
04:06:59,060 --> 04:06:59,740
Oh, my God.

5361
04:06:59,940 --> 04:07:03,280
Oh, my God.

5362
04:07:03,280 --> 04:07:03,500
What?

5363
04:07:09,490 --> 04:07:10,130
Oh, my gosh.

5364
04:07:10,150 --> 04:07:12,070
I'm trying to get to the...

5365
04:07:12,070 --> 04:07:12,470
Ah!

5366
04:07:13,350 --> 04:07:13,990
There we go.

5367
04:07:19,720 --> 04:07:21,720
Double body inspection!

5368
04:07:24,340 --> 04:07:24,740
Hello?

5369
04:07:25,280 --> 04:07:26,400
It looks like he's unconscious.

5370
04:07:28,260 --> 04:07:28,940
Excuse me.

5371
04:07:29,020 --> 04:07:30,520
Could you wake up for a second, please?

5372
04:07:32,220 --> 04:07:33,340
Pushy as ever, this detective.

5373
04:07:33,700 --> 04:07:34,100
Pushy as ever, this detective.

5374
04:07:35,160 --> 04:07:36,060
One thing I've learned...

5375
04:07:36,060 --> 04:07:40,180
is that the most newly dead stay unconscious for a little while at first.

5376
04:07:40,940 --> 04:07:41,300
Huh?

5377
04:07:42,240 --> 04:07:44,260
I was like that, and you were like that, too.

5378
04:07:46,180 --> 04:07:47,360
Yeah, I guess you're right.

5379
04:07:48,160 --> 04:07:51,060
Anyway, if we restart the flow of time now, you'll die.

5380
04:07:51,880 --> 04:07:52,640
Yeah, I know.

5381
04:07:53,540 --> 04:07:56,160
Why don't we try going back even further in time?

5382
04:07:57,380 --> 04:07:58,220
Even further?

5383
04:07:58,340 --> 04:07:58,640
But how?

5384
04:07:59,620 --> 04:08:00,060
Simple.

5385
04:08:00,160 --> 04:08:03,280
We go back four minutes before the death of this poor driver here.

5386
04:08:03,860 --> 04:08:04,300
Whoa!

5387
04:08:06,560 --> 04:08:07,740
You can do that?

5388
04:08:08,260 --> 04:08:08,700
Yeah!

5389
04:08:11,640 --> 04:08:14,560
I never tried it before, so I don't know how it'll go.

5390
04:08:14,820 --> 04:08:20,400
But if we can erase the driver's death, that should erase your death, too.

5391
04:08:21,740 --> 04:08:22,500
Oh, wow!

5392
04:08:23,180 --> 04:08:24,800
I can't think of any other way.

5393
04:08:25,040 --> 04:08:25,900
Let's try it.

5394
04:08:28,140 --> 04:08:28,580
Rewind!

5395
04:08:29,320 --> 04:08:30,360
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

5396
04:08:40,220 --> 04:08:41,020
Oh, my God!

5397
04:08:41,040 --> 04:08:41,660
Is this guy!

5398
04:08:43,300 --> 04:08:43,920
What the?

5399
04:08:44,460 --> 04:08:44,880
Yes!

5400
04:08:44,920 --> 04:08:45,500
I remember!

5401
04:08:46,100 --> 04:08:47,020
Oh, my gosh!

5402
04:08:47,060 --> 04:08:47,520
The park!

5403
04:08:50,360 --> 04:08:51,740
That's Lin, our rookie detective!

5404
04:08:52,420 --> 04:08:54,320
Is he the guy that phones the police station?

5405
04:08:54,760 --> 04:08:56,200
What's she doing at point X?

5406
04:08:56,500 --> 04:08:57,880
Could it be just a coincidence?

5407
04:09:01,180 --> 04:09:01,600
Um...

5408
04:09:02,980 --> 04:09:03,860
What was I gonna say?

5409
04:09:03,920 --> 04:09:04,100
Yeah!

5410
04:09:04,180 --> 04:09:05,200
Parkman and Hippie Man!

5411
04:09:05,400 --> 04:09:05,700
Yeah!

5412
04:09:08,640 --> 04:09:09,060
Um...

5413
04:09:09,060 --> 04:09:10,240
What was I gonna say, though?

5414
04:09:11,560 --> 04:09:11,660
I don't remember.

5415
04:09:14,580 --> 04:09:17,760
And we just got an APB on her a little while ago.

5416
04:09:17,920 --> 04:09:23,900
Something about an extremely important case's extremely important witness currently extremely on the run.

5417
04:09:25,640 --> 04:09:26,300
Now what?

5418
04:09:26,420 --> 04:09:27,680
Should I report this to Inspector Captain?

5419
04:09:27,760 --> 04:09:28,360
Yes, yes, yes!

5420
04:09:28,420 --> 04:09:29,100
He talks to him!

5421
04:09:29,320 --> 04:09:32,820
So he's the one that signals him.

5422
04:09:36,080 --> 04:09:36,940
Ah-ha!

5423
04:09:37,080 --> 04:09:37,820
Ha-ha-ha!

5424
04:09:37,820 --> 04:09:37,900
Ah!

5425
04:09:39,040 --> 04:09:40,260
Time to catch some sleep, Minto.

5426
04:09:40,320 --> 04:09:41,140
Enjoy the rest of the stream.

5427
04:09:41,240 --> 04:09:41,680
Thank you!

5428
04:09:42,000 --> 04:09:42,360
Goodnight!

5429
04:09:44,340 --> 04:09:46,720
They told us to stay off the radio unless it was an emergency.

5430
04:09:47,020 --> 04:09:48,520
But I think I'd better call this in.

5431
04:09:49,640 --> 04:09:50,180
Poor Lin.

5432
04:09:50,380 --> 04:09:51,680
I wonder what she did this time.

5433
04:09:51,820 --> 04:09:52,600
What do you mean, me?

5434
04:09:53,360 --> 04:09:55,540
Inspector Cavanella is pretty protective when it comes to Lin.

5435
04:09:55,740 --> 04:09:56,600
He'd want to know.

5436
04:09:57,660 --> 04:10:00,080
I'm gonna finish up this case and then we'll end, though.

5437
04:10:00,280 --> 04:10:03,100
So once we save this guy...

5438
04:10:05,840 --> 04:10:06,500
What's the matter?

5439
04:10:08,480 --> 04:10:09,000
Alright.

5440
04:10:09,140 --> 04:10:09,460
Fine.

5441
04:10:13,610 --> 04:10:14,570
Who called?

5442
04:10:20,050 --> 04:10:20,850
Who called?

5443
04:10:22,290 --> 04:10:23,650
And then we call...

5444
04:10:24,910 --> 04:10:25,170
people.

5445
04:10:25,390 --> 04:10:26,490
This is point X.

5446
04:10:28,750 --> 04:10:29,270
Idiot!

5447
04:10:30,350 --> 04:10:31,390
Oh, no!

5448
04:10:31,490 --> 04:10:31,990
It's important!

5449
04:10:32,490 --> 04:10:33,150
Yes, sir.

5450
04:10:33,230 --> 04:10:34,050
I'll go get her.

5451
04:10:34,130 --> 04:10:34,430
Okay.

5452
04:10:34,550 --> 04:10:36,410
I'm glad we got the Cliff Notes version of it.

5453
04:10:40,790 --> 04:10:41,510
Wee-woo!

5454
04:10:41,650 --> 04:10:42,050
Wee-woo!

5455
04:10:43,150 --> 04:10:44,810
The static is awful.

5456
04:10:46,710 --> 04:10:48,090
Eyes on the road, buddy.

5457
04:10:48,550 --> 04:10:50,750
Can't believe I forgot the trunk of all things.

5458
04:10:54,270 --> 04:10:56,010
Such a small body.

5459
04:10:56,070 --> 04:10:57,690
You probably only have a small...

5460
04:10:57,690 --> 04:11:00,550
He was listening in!

5461
04:11:04,790 --> 04:11:06,650
That's what I love about you.

5462
04:11:08,190 --> 04:11:09,810
It was bugged.

5463
04:11:09,810 --> 04:11:11,650
I spy a ladybug.

5464
04:11:14,430 --> 04:11:15,850
Thank you for the...

5465
04:11:15,850 --> 04:11:17,390
I don't know.

5466
04:11:17,670 --> 04:11:19,050
Jason Funderburker.

5467
04:11:19,210 --> 04:11:20,750
That guy's the total package.

5468
04:11:25,350 --> 04:11:26,550
A ladybug.

5469
04:11:26,950 --> 04:11:28,770
I just hate little bugs.

5470
04:11:28,930 --> 04:11:29,890
It was bugged.

5471
04:11:30,070 --> 04:11:32,770
I can't hear very well.

5472
04:11:37,270 --> 04:11:37,910
Aha!

5473
04:11:37,910 --> 04:11:38,410
Aha!

5474
04:11:40,810 --> 04:11:41,330
So...

5475
04:11:41,770 --> 04:11:43,890
When she lit it on fire!

5476
04:11:47,330 --> 04:11:48,330
Mm-hmm.

5477
04:11:49,030 --> 04:11:49,910
Mm-hmm.

5478
04:11:50,650 --> 04:11:51,170
Dang.

5479
04:11:51,870 --> 04:11:52,710
I can't believe he crashed.

5480
04:11:52,890 --> 04:11:55,010
This is why you wear your seat belts, first of all.

5481
04:11:55,070 --> 04:11:59,430
I can't believe he crashed so crazily that even the steering wheel broke off.

5482
04:12:01,910 --> 04:12:03,210
Rip his eardrums.

5483
04:12:03,210 --> 04:12:04,810
This is you listening to...

5484
04:12:04,810 --> 04:12:07,310
That's you when you listen to VTuber streams sometimes, isn't it?

5485
04:12:07,390 --> 04:12:12,570
You hear the scream and you're just like, I'm being sent to heaven!

5486
04:12:20,470 --> 04:12:22,410
The van driver was a detective.

5487
04:12:23,690 --> 04:12:24,650
Looks like it.

5488
04:12:25,350 --> 04:12:26,710
I noticed something, though.

5489
04:12:27,450 --> 04:12:30,910
That conversation he was listening to just before the crash.

5490
04:12:31,150 --> 04:12:32,750
I remember hearing it before.

5491
04:12:34,270 --> 04:12:34,890
You're right.

5492
04:12:34,970 --> 04:12:36,670
We heard it just a few minutes ago, didn't we?

5493
04:12:38,490 --> 04:12:39,910
When you were doing one of your karaoke streams...

5494
04:12:40,490 --> 04:12:41,630
What do you mean by that?

5495
04:12:42,990 --> 04:12:45,330
I don't scream during my karaoke streams.

5496
04:12:45,890 --> 04:12:48,410
Are you saying that your ears are not blessed during my karaoke?

5497
04:12:48,590 --> 04:12:49,850
Are you saying that I'm a shit singer?

5498
04:12:52,070 --> 04:12:52,630
Fine.

5499
04:12:53,590 --> 04:13:00,970
Everybody, you can thank Ninebreaker for me never doing another karaoke stream ever again.

5500
04:13:02,990 --> 04:13:03,550
Oh.

5501
04:13:05,390 --> 04:13:09,690
Not And I'll never ever again... get one guide.

5502
04:13:16,720 --> 04:13:19,920
Just after that conversation, the detective suddenly passed out.

5503
04:13:24,480 --> 04:13:25,940
What happened, I wonder?

5504
04:13:26,080 --> 04:13:27,040
Oh, I know what happened.

5505
04:13:27,840 --> 04:13:29,220
We already know the answer.

5506
04:13:29,360 --> 04:13:30,520
We saw what happened at the restaurant.

5507
04:13:33,280 --> 04:13:35,200
Yeah, she lit the little bug on fire.

5508
04:13:37,600 --> 04:13:40,040
Ba-bam, she burned up the ladybug.

5509
04:13:41,840 --> 04:13:45,760
Sometimes, when a high-tech bug like that is destroyed, it emits a loud signal.

5510
04:13:48,020 --> 04:13:50,120
I regret nothing.

5511
04:13:53,340 --> 04:13:54,920
I respect it.

5512
04:13:55,800 --> 04:14:00,520
He's like, if I go down, I'm going down with dignity.

5513
04:14:00,700 --> 04:14:01,080
You know what?

5514
04:14:01,180 --> 04:14:02,420
Stick to your ideals.

5515
04:14:04,940 --> 04:14:07,580
If that's what you believe, then you know what?

5516
04:14:08,900 --> 04:14:14,680
Don't just change your ideas because everybody else doesn't agree with you.

5517
04:14:14,840 --> 04:14:16,200
That's your opinion.

5518
04:14:18,300 --> 04:14:20,660
He accomplished his mission.

5519
04:14:24,100 --> 04:14:26,400
I respect it.

5520
04:14:28,200 --> 04:14:29,660
Stand proud.

5521
04:14:35,280 --> 04:14:37,480
He's still getting lynched though.

5522
04:14:37,580 --> 04:14:41,840
No, no, no, I'm not wrong.

5523
04:14:41,920 --> 04:14:42,980
The world is.

5524
04:14:43,980 --> 04:14:45,780
He basically said that.

5525
04:14:50,960 --> 04:14:51,940
So funny.

5526
04:14:53,620 --> 04:14:59,720
Find something to believe in, write in, even if it's, even if it's Min's terrible singing.

5527
04:15:04,200 --> 04:15:07,480
Loud enough to knock a person out if they were listening to it through headphones.

5528
04:15:07,480 --> 04:15:07,560
Loud enough to knock a person out if they were listening to it through headphones.

5529
04:15:07,560 --> 04:15:10,480
So that's why the detective passed out, huh?

5530
04:15:11,540 --> 04:15:11,980
Bingo.

5531
04:15:13,460 --> 04:15:15,120
Now let's stop it from happening.

5532
04:15:23,440 --> 04:15:24,220
Trick time.

5533
04:15:26,360 --> 04:15:26,800
Oh.

5534
04:15:28,240 --> 04:15:29,880
Oh, I was like, why was a soul there?

5535
04:15:31,940 --> 04:15:34,220
This is the place that the white suited inspector phone tonight.

5536
04:15:35,720 --> 04:15:36,160
This

5537
04:15:40,210 --> 04:15:43,290
is a parking lot of the park on the east side of town.

5538
04:15:43,510 --> 04:15:44,250
It's been years.

5539
04:15:45,190 --> 04:15:46,090
You know this park?

5540
04:15:46,530 --> 04:15:48,490
Yeah, I used to play here a lot when I was little.

5541
04:15:49,010 --> 04:15:52,850
But then one day, I swore I'd never set foot in this park ever again.

5542
04:15:53,810 --> 04:15:57,390
Because her father killed her mum.

5543
04:15:58,650 --> 04:16:00,930
Whoa, those are some really deep, dark feelings there.

5544
04:16:01,110 --> 04:16:01,950
I wonder what happened.

5545
04:16:03,450 --> 04:16:04,030
Hold it!

5546
04:16:05,590 --> 04:16:06,470
Don't give me that.

5547
04:16:06,510 --> 04:16:08,590
A ghost doesn't have a foot to set bit.

5548
04:16:09,490 --> 04:16:10,670
It's just a figure of speech.

5549
04:16:11,490 --> 04:16:13,670
What kind of nitpicker do you think I am?

5550
04:16:14,570 --> 04:16:15,290
Anyway, whatever.

5551
04:16:15,490 --> 04:16:16,350
Let's get started.

5552
04:16:17,290 --> 04:16:18,270
Okay, let's do that.

5553
04:16:18,390 --> 04:16:20,610
I won't press her about that other thing right now.

5554
04:16:22,030 --> 04:16:22,490
Let's see.

5555
04:16:22,830 --> 04:16:24,970
We can go to his flashlight.

5556
04:16:25,370 --> 04:16:27,230
We can go to his seat lever.

5557
04:16:28,370 --> 04:16:30,110
Oh yeah, let's put that down.

5558
04:16:31,710 --> 04:16:32,150
What?

5559
04:16:35,230 --> 04:16:35,630
Oh.

5560
04:16:36,010 --> 04:16:36,970
I guess we can...

5561
04:16:37,550 --> 04:16:37,990
Flashlight.

5562
04:16:38,050 --> 04:16:38,710
Wee woo, wee woo.

5563
04:16:41,290 --> 04:16:43,530
Doesn't look like the detective is going to come.

5564
04:16:45,770 --> 04:16:46,490
Thank god.

5565
04:16:47,070 --> 04:16:48,410
Might as well turn it off.

5566
04:16:48,470 --> 04:16:49,090
It's pretty loud.

5567
04:16:50,070 --> 04:16:50,670
Hold it.

5568
04:16:53,070 --> 04:16:54,570
What else can we get to?

5569
04:16:57,210 --> 04:16:58,370
Time is passing.

5570
04:16:59,490 --> 04:17:00,310
Oh, here he comes.

5571
04:17:00,370 --> 04:17:00,690
Here he comes.

5572
04:17:00,830 --> 04:17:02,150
And he's going to throw his binoculars.

5573
04:17:02,550 --> 04:17:04,250
And we can probably...

5574
04:17:04,910 --> 04:17:05,310
Yep.

5575
04:17:06,490 --> 04:17:07,930
Go to the binoculars.

5576
04:17:10,330 --> 04:17:12,790
They told us to stay off the radio unless it was an emergency.

5577
04:17:13,030 --> 04:17:13,510
But I think we can do it.

5578
04:17:13,510 --> 04:17:14,570
I think I better call this in.

5579
04:17:15,910 --> 04:17:16,670
Poor Lin.

5580
04:17:16,850 --> 04:17:18,110
I wonder what she did this time.

5581
04:17:18,950 --> 04:17:20,550
What does he mean this time?

5582
04:17:21,710 --> 04:17:22,790
Mind your own business.

5583
04:17:24,830 --> 04:17:26,350
I like to do things my...

5584
04:17:26,350 --> 04:17:27,370
My way, okay?

5585
04:17:33,010 --> 04:17:33,970
Did she...

5586
04:17:34,750 --> 04:17:35,990
Accidentally kill her dad?

5587
04:17:37,330 --> 04:17:38,130
Or her mom?

5588
04:17:40,690 --> 04:17:42,070
And that's why the...

5589
04:17:42,490 --> 04:17:42,730
The...

5590
04:17:42,730 --> 04:17:43,710
The guy...

5591
04:17:43,710 --> 04:17:45,230
In prison...

5592
04:17:46,770 --> 04:17:48,390
...is wanting to take the fall.

5593
04:17:52,490 --> 04:17:53,090
You know?

5594
04:17:53,650 --> 04:17:55,930
Like, what if she was a kid and she was just messing around?

5595
04:17:56,270 --> 04:17:57,410
Kind of like...

5596
04:17:59,310 --> 04:18:00,030
You know?

5597
04:18:00,330 --> 04:18:02,550
She was just messing around with her dad...

5598
04:18:02,550 --> 04:18:03,770
Her dad's a detective.

5599
04:18:04,050 --> 04:18:06,510
She's like, I wanna be like daddy too!

5600
04:18:07,230 --> 04:18:07,690
And...

5601
04:18:07,690 --> 04:18:10,470
She was playing with the gun...

5602
04:18:10,470 --> 04:18:12,150
And accidentally went off...

5603
04:18:12,150 --> 04:18:13,390
And killed her mom.

5604
04:18:13,510 --> 04:18:15,970
And so that's why the dad was just like, oh my gosh...

5605
04:18:15,970 --> 04:18:17,610
I have to do the death penalty.

5606
04:18:20,250 --> 04:18:20,690
Because...

5607
04:18:23,130 --> 04:18:24,890
I can't let my daughter take the fall.

5608
04:18:24,950 --> 04:18:25,630
She was just a kid.

5609
04:18:29,870 --> 04:18:31,150
That's my current theory.

5610
04:18:32,030 --> 04:18:33,330
That's my current theory.

5611
04:18:35,590 --> 04:18:37,390
You got a cart before the horse.

5612
04:18:44,790 --> 04:18:45,230
That's...

5613
04:18:48,170 --> 04:18:50,350
Inspector Cabanela is pretty protective...

5614
04:18:50,350 --> 04:18:51,350
When it comes to Lin.

5615
04:18:51,530 --> 04:18:52,370
He'd want to know.

5616
04:18:53,230 --> 04:18:54,190
And because...

5617
04:18:55,110 --> 04:18:57,150
Because they're close...

5618
04:18:57,730 --> 04:18:58,650
He's just like...

5619
04:18:58,650 --> 04:19:01,350
He probably does not want her to become a detective.

5620
04:19:02,090 --> 04:19:03,850
The Inspector Cabanela guy.

5621
04:19:03,990 --> 04:19:04,210
Right?

5622
04:19:07,130 --> 04:19:08,410
Because it's just like...

5623
04:19:08,410 --> 04:19:09,950
The same thing could happen to you.

5624
04:19:11,190 --> 04:19:13,310
But there's also all the other guys too.

5625
04:19:13,870 --> 04:19:14,590
I don't know.

5626
04:19:14,710 --> 04:19:15,390
I'm still cooking.

5627
04:19:15,690 --> 04:19:15,910
Oh!

5628
04:19:25,230 --> 04:19:26,510
So why are we involved?

5629
04:19:26,770 --> 04:19:27,570
Good question.

5630
04:19:28,190 --> 04:19:29,150
Good question.

5631
04:19:32,210 --> 04:19:33,470
I'm cooking is all.

5632
04:19:34,690 --> 04:19:35,930
This is why I don't cook.

5633
04:19:37,810 --> 04:19:39,690
Who is the detective talking to?

5634
04:19:40,270 --> 04:19:42,230
Don't keep yelling at me about these little things.

5635
04:19:43,470 --> 04:19:46,070
But they might be talking about something ridiculously important.

5636
04:19:46,850 --> 04:19:47,550
That's true.

5637
04:19:47,610 --> 04:19:48,190
But still...

5638
04:19:48,190 --> 04:19:50,190
It might be the person who really shot you.

5639
04:19:51,590 --> 04:19:53,210
Now you're just throwing things out there.

5640
04:19:53,630 --> 04:19:54,610
But in any case...

5641
04:19:54,610 --> 04:19:56,530
It looks like it's too late to get to the phone now.

5642
04:19:57,710 --> 04:19:58,670
I think we missed her.

5643
04:19:58,730 --> 04:19:59,890
But I didn't have a chance.

5644
04:19:59,930 --> 04:20:01,270
It didn't let me when he walked by.

5645
04:20:04,550 --> 04:20:06,890
I'm worried about that detective mem...

5646
04:20:06,890 --> 04:20:07,970
Mem... memory?

5647
04:20:08,710 --> 04:20:09,650
Who's the hell...

5648
04:20:09,650 --> 04:20:10,590
Who's detective memory?

5649
04:20:11,570 --> 04:20:14,930
They call her the Lin of the Special Investigation Unit.

5650
04:20:16,330 --> 04:20:17,910
Is that a bad thing?

5651
04:20:19,770 --> 04:20:20,710
Well, well...

5652
04:20:20,710 --> 04:20:21,510
Did you hear that, detective?

5653
04:20:24,950 --> 04:20:28,970
At least it's better than me being called the memory of the detective division.

5654
04:20:30,490 --> 04:20:31,190
At least it's better than me being called the memory of the detective division.

5655
04:20:31,190 --> 04:20:31,650
At any rate...

5656
04:20:31,650 --> 04:20:35,690
I'd better report to Inspector Cabanela before I worry about that listening device.

5657
04:20:42,410 --> 04:20:43,370
Yeah, see?

5658
04:20:43,530 --> 04:20:45,730
When he's walking around...

5659
04:20:45,730 --> 04:20:47,470
I missed my chance.

5660
04:20:48,110 --> 04:20:50,050
Should I restart, but...

5661
04:20:52,510 --> 04:20:53,310
Point X.

5662
04:20:54,870 --> 04:20:55,510
Safe here?

5663
04:20:55,650 --> 04:20:56,150
Did he show up?

5664
04:20:57,050 --> 04:20:57,990
No sir, not yet.

5665
04:20:58,590 --> 04:20:59,250
Blah blah blah!

5666
04:20:59,530 --> 04:21:00,830
I told you to stay off the radio!

5667
04:21:02,170 --> 04:21:03,470
Okay, this is important!

5668
04:21:03,970 --> 04:21:04,850
It's Lynn!

5669
04:21:05,990 --> 04:21:06,910
My baby!

5670
04:21:08,870 --> 04:21:09,910
What do you want me to do?

5671
04:21:10,310 --> 04:21:12,070
Get my baby away from point X!

5672
04:21:12,410 --> 04:21:13,530
Do it now, man!

5673
04:21:15,410 --> 04:21:15,870
Okay.

5674
04:21:22,660 --> 04:21:23,440
Now here.

5675
04:21:23,820 --> 04:21:24,700
He's on the move!

5676
04:21:25,400 --> 04:21:26,520
There isn't much time left.

5677
04:21:26,560 --> 04:21:27,260
We have to stop him.

5678
04:21:27,280 --> 04:21:27,580
Fast!

5679
04:21:28,120 --> 04:21:30,040
Otherwise he's going to crash into the chicken kitchen!

5680
04:21:31,160 --> 04:21:32,720
This is like that game, isn't it?

5681
04:21:33,500 --> 04:21:33,900
GTA?

5682
04:21:34,960 --> 04:21:35,980
Oh, game of chicken!

5683
04:21:37,980 --> 04:21:39,620
Sorry, but what's a game of chicken?

5684
04:21:40,620 --> 04:21:41,020
Sorry.

5685
04:21:41,440 --> 04:21:44,260
I'd better choose my audience more carefully the next time I tell a joke.

5686
04:21:46,020 --> 04:21:46,800
Never mind that.

5687
04:21:46,900 --> 04:21:47,880
We have to do something!

5688
04:21:49,060 --> 04:21:50,660
Okay, let's put a seat down.

5689
04:21:51,520 --> 04:21:52,820
And if we do...

5690
04:21:53,440 --> 04:21:54,540
Yeah, we still can't reach.

5691
04:21:54,700 --> 04:21:56,800
If we put the seat down...

5692
04:21:57,960 --> 04:21:58,920
He will...

5693
04:21:58,920 --> 04:22:00,300
Maybe the headphones will fly off.

5694
04:22:01,080 --> 04:22:01,560
Recline!

5695
04:22:02,200 --> 04:22:02,680
Wow!

5696
04:22:04,600 --> 04:22:05,940
What do you think you're doing?

5697
04:22:12,840 --> 04:22:14,440
I just thought I'd...

5698
04:22:14,440 --> 04:22:15,780
I'd better do something.

5699
04:22:16,220 --> 04:22:16,600
Never mind.

5700
04:22:16,840 --> 04:22:19,320
I can't!

5701
04:22:19,340 --> 04:22:19,980
It's too heavy!

5702
04:22:22,500 --> 04:22:24,140
How weak is this car?

5703
04:22:24,700 --> 04:22:26,260
The steering wheel come off every time.

5704
04:22:26,640 --> 04:22:27,980
All I can hope is...

5705
04:22:27,980 --> 04:22:29,620
This guy has strong ab muscles.

5706
04:22:32,800 --> 04:22:34,420
I don't think he dies.

5707
04:22:39,510 --> 04:22:41,410
Somehow sped his death up.

5708
04:22:45,390 --> 04:22:46,090
Time's up.

5709
04:22:46,770 --> 04:22:48,270
Oops, that was my bad.

5710
04:22:48,850 --> 04:22:52,770
I get that you felt like you had to do something, but that...

5711
04:22:53,330 --> 04:22:56,870
Well, there really isn't much I can do once the van is moving.

5712
04:22:58,010 --> 04:22:59,310
We should rethink this.

5713
04:22:59,410 --> 04:23:01,570
Was there any other path before that?

5714
04:23:02,710 --> 04:23:03,230
Okay.

5715
04:23:03,330 --> 04:23:04,210
From the beginning.

5716
04:23:04,390 --> 04:23:05,410
From the top, everybody.

5717
04:23:05,670 --> 04:23:06,250
From the top.

5718
04:23:09,050 --> 04:23:09,790
I... Okay.

5719
04:23:09,870 --> 04:23:11,010
Can you think of...

5720
04:23:11,010 --> 04:23:13,530
My logic wasn't so bad, though.

5721
04:23:13,610 --> 04:23:13,970
Right?

5722
04:23:15,070 --> 04:23:17,970
My logic was pretty sound, I'd say.

5723
04:23:19,950 --> 04:23:21,030
Oh, that opened.

5724
04:23:21,130 --> 04:23:21,610
That's so cute.

5725
04:23:24,030 --> 04:23:25,070
What the...

5726
04:23:29,610 --> 04:23:30,990
It opens a little...

5727
04:23:30,990 --> 04:23:31,970
It opens a little thing.

5728
04:23:32,830 --> 04:23:33,490
So cute.

5729
04:23:36,550 --> 04:23:37,370
Was it though?

5730
04:23:37,550 --> 04:23:37,790
Yeah!

5731
04:23:39,270 --> 04:23:40,190
I think...

5732
04:23:41,170 --> 04:23:43,310
I think I was...

5733
04:23:43,310 --> 04:23:44,610
How do I get over there?

5734
04:23:45,290 --> 04:23:47,110
Oh, maybe I make a lot of noise.

5735
04:23:47,690 --> 04:23:49,350
And when he's trying to listen...

5736
04:23:49,350 --> 04:23:50,130
Yeah, there we go.

5737
04:23:50,850 --> 04:23:53,070
He's like, turn that blasted thing off.

5738
04:23:59,340 --> 04:23:59,860
Oh!

5739
04:24:00,100 --> 04:24:00,380
Oh!

5740
04:24:12,680 --> 04:24:14,800
Did the binoculars get launched by the seat?

5741
04:24:15,620 --> 04:24:16,140
Did the binoculars get launched by the seat?

5742
04:24:19,540 --> 04:24:20,060
Pew!

5743
04:24:20,360 --> 04:24:20,880
Oh!

5744
04:24:21,800 --> 04:24:22,320
Pew!

5745
04:24:24,320 --> 04:24:24,840
Uh...

5746
04:24:26,660 --> 04:24:27,180
Uh...

5747
04:24:29,240 --> 04:24:29,760
Uh...

5748
04:24:46,420 --> 04:24:48,320
Did I do the wrong order?

5749
04:24:48,500 --> 04:24:48,600
Did I do the wrong order?

5750
04:24:48,600 --> 04:24:49,120
Wait, what do you mean?

5751
04:24:53,600 --> 04:24:54,220
Just reset?

5752
04:24:54,500 --> 04:24:55,420
Okay, okay, I'll reset.

5753
04:25:01,540 --> 04:25:03,740
Uh, yeah, because we want to hear the phone call.

5754
04:25:05,720 --> 04:25:07,380
Okay, so he's gonna...

5755
04:25:07,380 --> 04:25:08,280
Okay, let's see.

5756
04:25:15,820 --> 04:25:16,780
What the...

5757
04:25:17,400 --> 04:25:18,260
What is this?

5758
04:25:22,530 --> 04:25:23,270
I'm confused.

5759
04:25:23,630 --> 04:25:25,490
What's the order that I'm supposed to do?

5760
04:25:28,110 --> 04:25:29,610
Binocular before siren.

5761
04:25:29,910 --> 04:25:30,210
Okay.

5762
04:25:34,850 --> 04:25:35,230
Pew!

5763
04:25:35,490 --> 04:25:37,130
Oh, and then he picks them up.

5764
04:25:37,790 --> 04:25:39,750
And then he carries them to the...

5765
04:25:39,750 --> 04:25:40,630
to the thing.

5766
04:25:40,770 --> 04:25:41,650
Okay, I think I get it.

5767
04:25:42,810 --> 04:25:43,310
Wee woo!

5768
04:25:43,610 --> 04:25:43,950
Wee woo!

5769
04:25:44,150 --> 04:25:44,490
Wee woo!

5770
04:25:50,510 --> 04:25:50,890
Oh.

5771
04:25:53,190 --> 04:25:53,570
Yeah.

5772
04:25:54,650 --> 04:25:55,870
What are these doing here?

5773
04:25:56,910 --> 04:25:58,870
Wait, let me, let me, let me, let me...

5774
04:25:58,870 --> 04:25:59,370
Please!

5775
04:25:59,650 --> 04:26:00,210
There we go.

5776
04:26:02,550 --> 04:26:02,930
Okay.

5777
04:26:04,230 --> 04:26:05,450
Now we follow him.

5778
04:26:05,530 --> 04:26:05,870
Okay, okay.

5779
04:26:06,290 --> 04:26:07,110
Good, good, good, good.

5780
04:26:07,130 --> 04:26:08,030
Okay.

5781
04:26:09,970 --> 04:26:10,890
What's the matter?

5782
04:26:15,110 --> 04:26:15,910
Here we go.

5783
04:26:16,490 --> 04:26:16,990
Honk!

5784
04:26:21,590 --> 04:26:22,590
Detective Ringe?

5785
04:26:22,750 --> 04:26:23,710
This is memory.

5786
04:26:25,790 --> 04:26:26,790
She's memory!

5787
04:26:28,930 --> 04:26:29,990
Thanks for the super chat.

5788
04:26:32,030 --> 04:26:32,850
What's the matter?

5789
04:26:32,970 --> 04:26:34,370
It's not time for your regular report.

5790
04:26:34,750 --> 04:26:35,810
Did she just miss me?

5791
04:26:36,650 --> 04:26:37,530
Listen to this.

5792
04:26:37,710 --> 04:26:39,770
There's a suspicious couple in the bar upstairs.

5793
04:26:40,750 --> 04:26:42,650
I'm going to put a ladybug on them.

5794
04:26:43,410 --> 04:26:44,290
A ladybug?

5795
04:26:44,510 --> 04:26:45,830
You mean a listening device?

5796
04:26:46,930 --> 04:26:48,470
Don't do anything to blow our cover.

5797
04:26:48,770 --> 04:26:50,450
Inspector Cabanela will be furious.

5798
04:26:51,850 --> 04:26:54,210
But they are doing all kinds of suspicious whispering.

5799
04:26:54,750 --> 04:26:56,630
We have to find out what they're saying.

5800
04:26:57,090 --> 04:26:58,330
We have to find out what they're saying.

5801
04:26:58,330 --> 04:26:58,730
We have to find out what they're saying.

5802
04:26:58,730 --> 04:27:00,410
You can pick up on the signal from your van.

5803
04:27:01,030 --> 04:27:03,190
Check out their conversation for me, would you?

5804
04:27:03,410 --> 04:27:03,650
Check out their conversation for me, would you?

5805
04:27:04,270 --> 04:27:05,250
Alright, fine.

5806
04:27:05,750 --> 04:27:09,450
Once you get going on something, I know there's no stopping you.

5807
04:27:09,530 --> 04:27:15,150
Okay, so we have to figure out a way for her to change the position of the bug.

5808
04:27:15,330 --> 04:27:15,610
Okay.

5809
04:27:18,170 --> 04:27:18,650
Thanks.

5810
04:27:18,750 --> 04:27:19,470
Later then.

5811
04:27:19,930 --> 04:27:20,990
She's the murderer.

5812
04:27:22,190 --> 04:27:22,830
Hold on.

5813
04:27:23,050 --> 04:27:24,850
Did you see a customer come in just now?

5814
04:27:25,010 --> 04:27:26,970
A young woman with red hair and red boots?

5815
04:27:27,590 --> 04:27:29,830
Oh yeah, that restless suspicious chick?

5816
04:27:30,070 --> 04:27:30,370
Sure.

5817
04:27:32,010 --> 04:27:32,490
Suspicious?

5818
04:27:32,490 --> 04:27:34,290
I mean, come on.

5819
04:27:34,470 --> 04:27:38,290
As soon as she sat down, she ordered three glasses of water in a row.

5820
04:27:42,940 --> 04:27:45,620
And she spilled the second glass on the table.

5821
04:27:47,640 --> 04:27:48,380
Okay, fine.

5822
04:27:48,560 --> 04:27:50,500
Keep your eye on her too, if you would.

5823
04:27:51,020 --> 04:27:52,060
You got it.

5824
04:27:52,840 --> 04:27:55,700
Oh wow, that waitress was an undercover agent.

5825
04:27:56,760 --> 04:27:59,240
And she apparently thought you were pretty suspicious too.

5826
04:28:00,520 --> 04:28:01,560
Oh yeah, sorry.

5827
04:28:01,720 --> 04:28:02,600
I was really thirsty.

5828
04:28:04,780 --> 04:28:06,020
Um, no, I don't know.

5829
04:28:06,600 --> 04:28:08,640
Anyway, did you hear about what I heard?

5830
04:28:08,920 --> 04:28:10,200
About the listening device?

5831
04:28:10,860 --> 04:28:12,420
We have to do something about that bug.

5832
04:28:13,600 --> 04:28:15,920
So we have to stay here and follow up on the waitress.

5833
04:28:17,100 --> 04:28:18,660
Looks like it's time to make a decision.

5834
04:28:21,120 --> 04:28:21,920
Go there!

5835
04:28:29,120 --> 04:28:32,080
Can't even be a dojiko without being called suspicious these days.

5836
04:28:32,180 --> 04:28:33,520
Alright, SMH.

5837
04:28:36,420 --> 04:28:37,700
Okay, trace complete.

5838
04:28:39,300 --> 04:28:40,460
We're in the kitchen.

5839
04:28:41,040 --> 04:28:42,920
We're cooking for real.

5840
04:28:43,020 --> 04:28:43,340
Whoa.

5841
04:28:43,840 --> 04:28:46,200
He just cooked the whole thing on a frying pan.

5842
04:28:47,440 --> 04:28:48,400
Look where we are.

5843
04:28:48,940 --> 04:28:51,080
The heart of the chicken kitchen.

5844
04:28:51,280 --> 04:28:52,820
I keep wanting to say the kitchen chicken.

5845
04:28:53,100 --> 04:28:54,300
I keep wanting to mix them up.

5846
04:28:54,960 --> 04:28:57,260
Whereas most people say the kitchen.

5847
04:29:14,900 --> 04:29:17,500
I hope the key to preventing that incident is in the kitchen.

5848
04:29:17,520 --> 04:29:18,020
It's here somewhere.

5849
04:29:19,260 --> 04:29:20,460
Oh, I bet it will be.

5850
04:29:20,560 --> 04:29:21,600
You know what they say.

5851
04:29:21,900 --> 04:29:24,600
Where there's smokin' chicken, there's fire.

5852
04:29:26,160 --> 04:29:29,280
Now that you mention it, it is pretty smoky in here.

5853
04:29:31,020 --> 04:29:31,800
Fate changed.

5854
04:29:34,740 --> 04:29:36,060
Let's see what we got in here.

5855
04:29:36,160 --> 04:29:37,020
We got a little t-shirt.

5856
04:29:37,860 --> 04:29:38,860
Scrunch and stretch.

5857
04:29:39,620 --> 04:29:41,540
A switch that we can turn on.

5858
04:29:43,100 --> 04:29:43,960
That's the phone.

5859
04:29:44,820 --> 04:29:45,840
What does this do?

5860
04:29:47,560 --> 04:29:48,140
Oh.

5861
04:29:50,480 --> 04:29:51,600
Oh my god.

5862
04:29:51,640 --> 04:29:52,220
So cute.

5863
04:29:52,720 --> 04:29:53,560
A pie.

5864
04:29:53,960 --> 04:29:55,080
And the kettle.

5865
04:29:58,880 --> 04:30:00,480
Rock that kettle.

5866
04:30:01,440 --> 04:30:02,600
Never mind.

5867
04:30:04,700 --> 04:30:05,900
Do you think that's...

5868
04:30:05,900 --> 04:30:07,160
Oh, she's doing it right now.

5869
04:30:08,640 --> 04:30:10,540
She's probably planting the ladybug.

5870
04:30:10,780 --> 04:30:12,380
Now that I think about it.

5871
04:30:13,060 --> 04:30:16,040
It's this waitress's meddling that starts the whole chain of events.

5872
04:30:16,200 --> 04:30:16,680
Exactly.

5873
04:30:18,420 --> 04:30:21,880
The detective wouldn't have gotten his ears blown out and wouldn't have crashed.

5874
04:30:24,540 --> 04:30:27,060
In other words, we're witnessing it with our own eyes.

5875
04:30:27,180 --> 04:30:31,200
The cause of a huge disaster slowly being planted in a chicken.

5876
04:30:33,340 --> 04:30:34,880
Hey, I just had a good idea.

5877
04:30:36,040 --> 04:30:37,640
The outfit reminds me of something.

5878
04:30:37,800 --> 04:30:43,160
It reminds me of the waitress outfit that Maya wears as an ace attorney.

5879
04:30:44,300 --> 04:30:45,920
About what to do about the ladybug?

5880
04:30:47,560 --> 04:30:50,880
We could get her crushed under the chicken instead of me.

5881
04:30:52,300 --> 04:30:52,700
No!

5882
04:30:55,480 --> 04:30:56,940
I can't tell if you're kidding.

5883
04:30:57,300 --> 04:31:00,220
At any rate, now we've seen the root cause of the incident.

5884
04:31:01,020 --> 04:31:05,120
And all we have to do now is think of a way to take care of it.

5885
04:31:05,820 --> 04:31:08,140
Lin is literally suggesting murder right now.

5886
04:31:10,700 --> 04:31:11,880
What is in his hat?

5887
04:31:13,680 --> 04:31:15,140
I think that's wine.

5888
04:31:15,400 --> 04:31:16,340
I think that's a bottle.

5889
04:31:18,280 --> 04:31:19,320
Oh my god, you guys.

5890
04:31:19,380 --> 04:31:23,540
If you ever start seeing Matara wearing a suspiciously large hat...

5891
04:31:26,480 --> 04:31:27,360
It's Remy?

5892
04:31:27,520 --> 04:31:27,820
No!

5893
04:31:28,020 --> 04:31:29,220
It's not Remy.

5894
04:31:32,500 --> 04:31:33,700
I can't tell.

5895
04:31:39,440 --> 04:31:40,400
What's this switch?

5896
04:31:41,600 --> 04:31:42,820
It's smoky in here.

5897
04:31:43,240 --> 04:31:43,880
What's wrong?

5898
04:31:44,180 --> 04:31:45,660
I can't seem to raise this switch.

5899
04:31:45,700 --> 04:31:46,420
It won't budge.

5900
04:31:47,720 --> 04:31:50,640
It's not surprising considering this whole place is sticky with grease.

5901
04:31:51,140 --> 04:31:52,380
I bet it must be stuck.

5902
04:31:53,680 --> 04:31:55,080
It does feel pretty sticky.

5903
04:31:55,260 --> 04:31:55,860
It's orange?

5904
04:31:56,080 --> 04:31:56,400
It's alive?

5905
04:32:00,700 --> 04:32:02,940
But if the switch... Wait, really?

5906
04:32:03,080 --> 04:32:03,300
Wait.

5907
04:32:03,780 --> 04:32:06,920
But if the switch were already raised, I bet I could manage to lower it.

5908
04:32:09,340 --> 04:32:10,200
Oh, you're right.

5909
04:32:11,220 --> 04:32:12,380
What is in there?

5910
04:32:16,550 --> 04:32:17,630
What is in there?

5911
04:32:18,850 --> 04:32:19,850
What's in the hat?

5912
04:32:23,510 --> 04:32:24,730
Maybe it's his head?

5913
04:32:25,430 --> 04:32:27,650
Maybe he's got... Remember the other guy that...

5914
04:32:27,650 --> 04:32:28,490
Maybe they're related.

5915
04:32:28,670 --> 04:32:31,030
Him and the other guy that likes the curry and chicken.

5916
04:32:33,350 --> 04:32:35,490
Him and the curry and chicken guy are related.

5917
04:32:45,730 --> 04:32:46,770
Oh, she's raising it.

5918
04:32:47,030 --> 04:32:48,070
Oh, not bad.

5919
04:32:50,450 --> 04:32:51,270
There we go.

5920
04:32:53,350 --> 04:32:54,310
And lift.

5921
04:32:59,330 --> 04:32:59,770
Nice.

5922
04:32:59,770 --> 04:33:00,390
Oh, wow.

5923
04:33:00,590 --> 04:33:02,230
It was really smoky in there.

5924
04:33:02,670 --> 04:33:03,590
And turn it off.

5925
04:33:06,910 --> 04:33:08,610
She's still trying to bug that thing.

5926
04:33:09,230 --> 04:33:09,850
Oh, see!

5927
04:33:09,930 --> 04:33:13,290
I told you it was a bottle of... You guys all said it was a rat!

5928
04:33:15,950 --> 04:33:17,930
You all said it was a rat!

5929
04:33:23,590 --> 04:33:24,030
Uh...

5930
04:33:24,630 --> 04:33:27,250
Can I use... I don't think I can attach...

5931
04:33:28,750 --> 04:33:29,190
Uh...

5932
04:33:36,430 --> 04:33:39,530
Oh, I think I need to be on his hat so I can get to the lower stuff.

5933
04:33:41,290 --> 04:33:41,610
Maybe.

5934
04:33:43,350 --> 04:33:43,950
There we go.

5935
04:33:44,070 --> 04:33:44,510
There we go.

5936
04:33:47,510 --> 04:33:48,150
Operating this...

5937
04:33:48,150 --> 04:33:48,230
Oh!

5938
04:33:50,370 --> 04:33:50,690
Hey,

5939
04:33:54,570 --> 04:33:55,910
what's up with this lazy Susan?

5940
04:33:56,190 --> 04:33:57,050
It's acting up today.

5941
04:33:57,910 --> 04:34:00,310
Maybe it's out of sorts because I was spinning around...

5942
04:34:00,310 --> 04:34:01,810
Oh, I know what we need to do!

5943
04:34:02,170 --> 04:34:03,450
I know what we need to do!

5944
04:34:03,630 --> 04:34:05,110
We need to make it smoky.

5945
04:34:05,110 --> 04:34:12,970
While she's working on setting up the... lifting the thing, we gotta switch it so she doesn't realize that we switched them.

5946
04:34:15,030 --> 04:34:16,250
I get it now.

5947
04:34:16,370 --> 04:34:17,030
I get it.

5948
04:34:17,410 --> 04:34:19,230
I get it, I get it, I get it!

5949
04:34:19,990 --> 04:34:22,290
Okay, it's a matter of timing once again.

5950
04:34:23,050 --> 04:34:24,250
Oh, maybe it's out of sorts.

5951
04:34:24,970 --> 04:34:26,210
How about thinking...

5952
04:34:26,210 --> 04:34:27,630
Maybe it might be broken?

5953
04:34:28,790 --> 04:34:29,970
But it really isn't broken.

5954
04:34:30,190 --> 04:34:31,010
It's just us ghosts.

5955
04:34:34,790 --> 04:34:36,010
Oh, we're stuck here though.

5956
04:34:36,470 --> 04:34:36,590
Uh oh.

5957
04:34:37,430 --> 04:34:38,370
We're stuck here.

5958
04:34:38,870 --> 04:34:40,270
Until we can get through.

5959
04:34:44,430 --> 04:34:44,870
Oh!

5960
04:34:46,910 --> 04:34:48,990
Uh oh, I think I just did the timing bad.

5961
04:34:55,570 --> 04:34:56,010
Alright.

5962
04:34:57,650 --> 04:34:58,950
So from here...

5963
04:35:02,950 --> 04:35:03,690
We'll wait.

5964
04:35:03,790 --> 04:35:04,590
We'll wait in the hat.

5965
04:35:05,790 --> 04:35:07,150
Hopefully the timing works.

5966
04:35:08,710 --> 04:35:10,650
Hopefully it gets nice and stuffy.

5967
04:35:12,570 --> 04:35:13,730
It's smoky in here.

5968
04:35:13,910 --> 04:35:15,610
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5969
04:35:17,110 --> 04:35:17,550
Yes!

5970
04:35:19,110 --> 04:35:20,170
Alright, now we wait.

5971
04:35:23,350 --> 04:35:24,130
There we go!

5972
04:35:24,690 --> 04:35:25,670
Okay, that should be it.

5973
04:35:27,270 --> 04:35:28,230
That should be it.

5974
04:35:30,210 --> 04:35:31,450
Sugoi genius ghost made.

5975
04:35:32,730 --> 04:35:34,510
I should be a detective, shouldn't I?

5976
04:35:35,830 --> 04:35:36,650
There, all set!

5977
04:35:37,270 --> 04:35:37,710
Nice.

5978
04:35:37,710 --> 04:35:37,870
Nice.

5979
04:35:42,670 --> 04:35:44,570
There, how about that?

5980
04:35:45,710 --> 04:35:48,010
The ladybug is still sitting on the table.

5981
04:35:48,130 --> 04:35:48,770
We did it!

5982
04:35:57,490 --> 04:36:19,830
Chicken Thou art so beautiful Chicken Chicken Chicken You just Oh, I took a bite My heart swelled with pride And I got goosebumps What the heck is this?

5983
04:36:30,670 --> 04:36:31,270
Chicken

5984
04:36:35,350 --> 04:36:36,790
Chicken, chicken, chicken.

5985
04:36:37,170 --> 04:36:39,050
Chicken, chicken, chicken.

5986
04:36:40,330 --> 04:36:43,910
Looks like you've escaped the fate of being hammered by your horrible head.

5987
04:36:45,870 --> 04:36:48,990
Yes, but I still haven't escaped the worst darkness of this terrible night.

5988
04:36:50,310 --> 04:36:51,890
I shot you, didn't I?

5989
04:36:54,530 --> 04:36:57,710
Don't sing too much, you might shock the poor driver's ears.

5990
04:37:01,190 --> 04:37:03,630
Oh my god, I'm now the cause of the incident.

5991
04:37:04,810 --> 04:37:08,490
There must have been some sort of complicated set of circumstances that made you do it.

5992
04:37:09,330 --> 04:37:12,310
It's never okay to shoot a person, no matter what the circumstances.

5993
04:37:14,350 --> 04:37:16,930
Hey, shouldn't be that... shouldn't that be my line?

5994
04:37:17,110 --> 04:37:18,210
But anyway...

5995
04:37:21,890 --> 04:37:25,910
You were investigating a case, and I was supposed to give you information on that case.

5996
04:37:26,290 --> 04:37:28,090
Maybe it's time you told me about it.

5997
04:37:28,570 --> 04:37:30,410
Tell me about the case you're looking into.

5998
04:37:32,350 --> 04:37:33,790
Yes, I guess I should.

5999
04:37:35,670 --> 04:37:37,530
Well, let's go back to the new present first.

6000
04:37:38,210 --> 04:37:38,890
Okay, sure.

6001
04:37:39,410 --> 04:37:39,850
Okay.

6002
04:37:40,610 --> 04:37:41,570
Back to the present.

6003
04:37:52,710 --> 04:37:55,370
I thought there would be music so I could drink my water.

6004
04:37:56,130 --> 04:37:59,090
Back in the new present, the delicious aroma of chicken fills the air.

6005
04:37:59,410 --> 04:38:00,890
But I'm still thinking about Lin.

6006
04:38:02,450 --> 04:38:05,610
I wonder if she's still waiting for her chicken to be served.

6007
04:38:05,910 --> 04:38:07,390
I decided to go see her.

6008
04:38:07,470 --> 04:38:11,110
See her and ask her the questions that were still consuming me.

6009
04:38:11,710 --> 04:38:12,890
Not concerning you.

6010
04:38:13,030 --> 04:38:13,270
Okay.

6011
04:38:13,730 --> 04:38:14,210
Consuming.

6012
04:38:16,410 --> 04:38:20,230
I'm still stuck here until this guy decides to...

6013
04:38:21,950 --> 04:38:24,810
Until this guy... I'm still... I'm still... Oh, there we go.

6014
04:38:31,530 --> 04:38:33,770
Why is there even a button down here?

6015
04:38:34,870 --> 04:38:39,250
Um, the chicken kitchen?

6016
04:38:49,370 --> 04:38:49,890
Okay.

6017
04:38:49,890 --> 04:38:50,550
Very good.

6018
04:38:52,670 --> 04:38:56,470
If this was a cheese restaurant, I would have said, very gouda.

6019
04:38:58,090 --> 04:39:01,190
The disastrous accident has been completely erased.

6020
04:39:01,590 --> 04:39:04,730
Once again, I've saved the red-headed detective from death.

6021
04:39:04,990 --> 04:39:07,330
Saved Lin, the criminal who stole my life.

6022
04:39:07,410 --> 04:39:09,090
And you saved another man's life too.

6023
04:39:09,670 --> 04:39:11,390
Let's not forget about that as well.

6024
04:39:13,150 --> 04:39:15,830
But also, what were those guys doing upstairs?

6025
04:39:18,150 --> 04:39:18,590
Boo!

6026
04:39:19,090 --> 04:39:20,810
I know you guys would like it.

6027
04:39:20,830 --> 04:39:21,230
Thank you.

6028
04:39:21,330 --> 04:39:22,210
You guys are too kind.

6029
04:39:22,290 --> 04:39:22,670
Oh my gosh.

6030
04:39:23,510 --> 04:39:26,650
One question in particular hangs heavy on my mind.

6031
04:39:27,090 --> 04:39:28,370
Why did she shoot me?

6032
04:39:28,710 --> 04:39:30,930
Till I know the answer, I'll never be satisfied.

6033
04:39:34,190 --> 04:39:34,630
Oh!

6034
04:39:39,400 --> 04:39:41,920
Wait, maybe she's actually related to the other guy.

6035
04:39:45,980 --> 04:39:49,240
Meanwhile, Lin's appetite is apparently foremost in her mind.

6036
04:39:49,460 --> 04:39:52,300
A golden brown chicken sits on the table in front of her.

6037
04:39:52,520 --> 04:39:55,100
Until she eats the whole thing, she'll probably never be satisfied.

6038
04:40:00,280 --> 04:40:01,480
Wait, how do we get over there?

6039
04:40:02,340 --> 04:40:05,220
Telephone book, menu board...

6040
04:40:11,190 --> 04:40:12,450
She's not holding on to anything.

6041
04:40:18,810 --> 04:40:20,870
Oh, I didn't know you were here, Detective Range.

6042
04:40:21,710 --> 04:40:23,050
Come to see me, didn't you?

6043
04:40:24,050 --> 04:40:25,350
Aw, that's so sweet.

6044
04:40:27,190 --> 04:40:28,050
Oh hi, memory.

6045
04:40:28,570 --> 04:40:29,890
Uh, don't mind us.

6046
04:40:30,130 --> 04:40:31,490
Just pretend we're not here.

6047
04:40:32,350 --> 04:40:34,850
Why don't you try some chicken while you're here?

6048
04:40:35,890 --> 04:40:36,550
No thanks.

6049
04:40:36,750 --> 04:40:37,610
Oh, the water.

6050
04:40:37,630 --> 04:40:38,030
That's right.

6051
04:40:38,110 --> 04:40:39,390
I gotta do the water thingy.

6052
04:40:39,850 --> 04:40:42,050
Just watching Lin eat is quite enough for me.

6053
04:40:44,290 --> 04:40:45,590
So, how'd it turn out?

6054
04:40:45,730 --> 04:40:46,790
With my ladybug.

6055
04:40:47,290 --> 04:40:48,530
Oh, that listening device?

6056
04:40:48,790 --> 04:40:49,290
Well, let's see.

6057
04:40:49,450 --> 04:40:51,830
I thought the gentleman had a very nice singing voice.

6058
04:40:52,470 --> 04:40:54,430
Sorry, but we're in the middle of an important talk.

6059
04:40:54,630 --> 04:40:55,650
Could you leave us to it?

6060
04:40:57,230 --> 04:41:00,330
But you guys are the ones who called me over.

6061
04:41:02,070 --> 04:41:05,490
Yeah, we need her to be holding the pitcher.

6062
04:41:05,670 --> 04:41:06,190
Odd girl.

6063
04:41:06,490 --> 04:41:07,230
I agree.

6064
04:41:07,610 --> 04:41:08,270
Me too.

6065
04:41:13,170 --> 04:41:14,290
She needs to be...

6066
04:41:14,290 --> 04:41:15,190
Oh wait, that's right.

6067
04:41:15,370 --> 04:41:17,190
One, two, three.

6068
04:41:19,290 --> 04:41:20,210
There it is.

6069
04:41:24,530 --> 04:41:26,350
Did you decide you want some chicken?

6070
04:41:26,790 --> 04:41:27,770
Or me?

6071
04:41:30,830 --> 04:41:31,910
Miss Memory.

6072
04:41:33,230 --> 04:41:35,590
She flirts with anything that breeds.

6073
04:41:37,970 --> 04:41:39,130
We didn't call you.

6074
04:41:39,230 --> 04:41:40,590
Sorry, but could you give us some privacy?

6075
04:41:41,330 --> 04:41:42,530
No, stay right there.

6076
04:41:42,950 --> 04:41:43,470
Huh?

6077
04:41:44,490 --> 04:41:46,690
I'm at the crucial moment with this chicken here.

6078
04:41:47,330 --> 04:41:50,130
I'll need you to pour me some water if it starts going down wrong.

6079
04:41:51,550 --> 04:41:54,250
Lynn, you don't have to risk your life over chicken, you know.

6080
04:41:54,690 --> 04:41:56,770
Oh my god, we're gonna have to save her from the chicken.

6081
04:41:57,110 --> 04:41:57,710
He's right.

6082
04:41:58,030 --> 04:41:59,650
Look at her attacking that thing.

6083
04:42:00,370 --> 04:42:01,970
I definitely want her...

6084
04:42:01,970 --> 04:42:02,810
Calm down there, Momo.

6085
04:42:04,910 --> 04:42:06,210
Calm down there, okay?

6086
04:42:10,230 --> 04:42:12,130
Anyway, I better move now while I have the chance.

6087
04:42:13,410 --> 04:42:14,010
Tricked her.

6088
04:42:16,810 --> 04:42:17,850
Oh, that's funny.

6089
04:42:19,870 --> 04:42:22,830
Even though I just saved that detective, he doesn't have a core.

6090
04:42:25,290 --> 04:42:26,930
Not like the one Lynn had.

6091
04:42:27,430 --> 04:42:29,410
Or that valiant little doggy missile.

6092
04:42:29,930 --> 04:42:32,590
Maybe because he was unconscious, we couldn't talk to him.

6093
04:42:33,030 --> 04:42:36,110
I thought the ones I save are supposed to develop a core when they're alive again.

6094
04:42:38,710 --> 04:42:41,630
I guess I still have things to learn about these powers of the dead.

6095
04:42:43,630 --> 04:42:45,250
That man has no soul.

6096
04:42:45,850 --> 04:42:46,990
I'm heading back now.

6097
04:42:47,150 --> 04:42:48,330
Lots of things to do, you know.

6098
04:42:49,650 --> 04:42:51,910
Yeah, like washing dishes and planting bugs.

6099
04:42:52,790 --> 04:42:55,270
Someday I'll plant a big one on you, detective.

6100
04:42:58,430 --> 04:42:59,610
She's so forward.

6101
04:43:00,270 --> 04:43:01,510
Goodness, girl.

6102
04:43:01,950 --> 04:43:02,770
Odd girl.

6103
04:43:02,950 --> 04:43:03,670
I agree.

6104
04:43:03,850 --> 04:43:04,530
Me too.

6105
04:43:08,770 --> 04:43:09,770
Bing, bing.

6106
04:43:11,050 --> 04:43:11,910
Listen, Lynn.

6107
04:43:12,370 --> 04:43:14,210
You've explained your side and I understand.

6108
04:43:14,490 --> 04:43:16,390
But there's an APB out on you.

6109
04:43:17,710 --> 04:43:19,590
Can't you at least hurry up and get out of here?

6110
04:43:19,710 --> 04:43:21,370
You know, slip away quietly?

6111
04:43:22,190 --> 04:43:22,990
Me three.

6112
04:43:24,150 --> 04:43:24,990
No can do.

6113
04:43:25,250 --> 04:43:26,590
I'm meeting somebody here.

6114
04:43:27,530 --> 04:43:28,310
Meeting somebody?

6115
04:43:28,510 --> 04:43:29,390
Oh yeah, that's right.

6116
04:43:29,650 --> 04:43:30,850
The little lady, Camilla.

6117
04:43:31,790 --> 04:43:33,830
But why do you have to meet somebody here?

6118
04:43:34,310 --> 04:43:36,970
The Special Investigation Unit is watching this restaurant.

6119
04:43:37,430 --> 04:43:39,290
Now, how can that be a coincidence?

6120
04:43:40,110 --> 04:43:41,990
I don't know, but it is a coincidence.

6121
04:43:43,770 --> 04:43:45,010
Yeah, where is Camilla?

6122
04:43:46,390 --> 04:43:48,070
Hey, is it true what they say?

6123
04:43:48,310 --> 04:43:52,250
That you're still looking into Detective Jowd's case on your own?

6124
04:43:56,790 --> 04:43:58,970
Inspector Cabanella is worried about you, you know.

6125
04:43:59,110 --> 04:44:02,690
I understand how you feel, but just don't do anything crazy, okay?

6126
04:44:07,680 --> 04:44:08,620
Odd girl.

6127
04:44:10,320 --> 04:44:11,900
What does that supposed to mean?

6128
04:44:13,680 --> 04:44:14,720
Um... huh?

6129
04:44:18,870 --> 04:44:20,630
What does that supposed to mean?

6130
04:44:20,750 --> 04:44:21,550
Odd girl.

6131
04:44:21,790 --> 04:44:22,710
Pointing at me.

6132
04:44:23,630 --> 04:44:24,190
Hmm?

6133
04:44:24,410 --> 04:44:24,970
Hmm?

6134
04:44:36,460 --> 04:44:38,020
Time to invade her brain.

6135
04:44:39,600 --> 04:44:42,080
So how's that chicken you've been waiting so long for?

6136
04:44:42,700 --> 04:44:43,660
It's great!

6137
04:44:44,020 --> 04:44:45,060
It's great!

6138
04:44:47,120 --> 04:44:48,200
Chicken puff cereal?

6139
04:44:48,420 --> 04:44:49,920
No wait, that's Reese's Puffs.

6140
04:44:52,640 --> 04:44:53,760
Chicken for breakfast?

6141
04:44:54,040 --> 04:44:55,360
No, chicken puff cereal!

6142
04:44:55,980 --> 04:44:57,060
They're great!

6143
04:44:57,060 --> 04:44:57,180
They're great!

6144
04:44:58,820 --> 04:44:59,800
But you know...

6145
04:45:00,260 --> 04:45:01,660
With Detective Ringe...

6146
04:45:01,660 --> 04:45:04,240
That's his name by the way, sitting right across from me.

6147
04:45:05,340 --> 04:45:06,080
I mean...

6148
04:45:06,080 --> 04:45:08,180
He was just dead a few moments ago, right?

6149
04:45:08,660 --> 04:45:10,560
That's kind of taking the edge off my appetite.

6150
04:45:11,380 --> 04:45:12,180
Oh brother.

6151
04:45:12,800 --> 04:45:13,940
This guy stinks!

6152
04:45:15,080 --> 04:45:16,120
But he's a great guy.

6153
04:45:16,340 --> 04:45:17,860
He understands my situation, he said.

6154
04:45:18,460 --> 04:45:19,680
You're thinking of Frosties.

6155
04:45:19,720 --> 04:45:20,900
I'm mixing them both up, okay?

6156
04:45:22,500 --> 04:45:24,100
I'm mixing everything up, okay?

6157
04:45:24,240 --> 04:45:25,500
I knew it.

6158
04:45:25,540 --> 04:45:26,120
I already know.

6159
04:45:26,120 --> 04:45:27,420
You don't have to tell me.

6160
04:45:29,120 --> 04:45:31,060
He's going to give me a pass, just for tonight.

6161
04:45:31,800 --> 04:45:34,000
Speaking of Detective Ringe, I noticed something strange.

6162
04:45:34,340 --> 04:45:35,580
He doesn't have a core now.

6163
04:45:37,420 --> 04:45:38,100
He doesn't?

6164
04:45:38,720 --> 04:45:42,120
I thought a core was supposed to show up once I saved somebody.

6165
04:45:42,920 --> 04:45:44,500
Hmm, I wonder if...

6166
04:45:45,720 --> 04:45:48,560
When he possessed his corpse, he was unconscious, right?

6167
04:45:49,800 --> 04:45:50,500
Unconscious, yeah.

6168
04:45:50,840 --> 04:45:51,780
He was, wasn't he?

6169
04:45:52,200 --> 04:45:54,720
Just like you, you were unconscious the first time I saved you too.

6170
04:45:56,120 --> 04:45:57,700
After I saved you, you didn't have a core either.

6171
04:45:58,880 --> 04:45:59,960
So for people who are...

6172
04:45:59,960 --> 04:46:00,140
See?

6173
04:46:01,620 --> 04:46:02,820
I already called it.

6174
04:46:03,040 --> 04:46:06,260
For people who are unconscious, when you save them, no core shows up.

6175
04:46:07,060 --> 04:46:08,660
I think that's probably what it is.

6176
04:46:09,280 --> 04:46:12,020
We had to save her a second time before she regained her memory.

6177
04:46:12,200 --> 04:46:13,320
Or regained any...

6178
04:46:14,260 --> 04:46:14,660
Sentience?

6179
04:46:16,080 --> 04:46:16,880
You might be right.

6180
04:46:17,100 --> 04:46:18,800
Okay, I'll leave Ringe to you then.

6181
04:46:19,460 --> 04:46:21,360
But I've still got lots of questions for you.

6182
04:46:22,180 --> 04:46:23,200
Yeah, I thought you would.

6183
04:46:23,400 --> 04:46:25,480
She's just sitting here eating and like...

6184
04:46:25,480 --> 04:46:26,220
In her thoughts.

6185
04:46:26,360 --> 04:46:27,560
Talking with this ghost.

6186
04:46:27,860 --> 04:46:29,300
And the other detective is like...

6187
04:46:29,300 --> 04:46:29,400
Lin.

6188
04:46:30,240 --> 04:46:30,640
Lin.

6189
04:46:31,820 --> 04:46:32,220
Lin.

6190
04:46:32,260 --> 04:46:32,660
Lin.

6191
04:46:32,880 --> 04:46:33,280
Lin.

6192
04:46:33,320 --> 04:46:34,620
Lin, I know you really love the chicken.

6193
04:46:34,720 --> 04:46:35,900
But you just gotta answer me.

6194
04:46:35,940 --> 04:46:36,200
Lin.

6195
04:46:36,420 --> 04:46:37,540
Lin, just say anything.

6196
04:46:37,640 --> 04:46:37,860
Lin.

6197
04:46:39,900 --> 04:46:41,000
Let's get started then.

6198
04:46:41,340 --> 04:46:42,040
Oh, okay.

6199
04:46:42,080 --> 04:46:42,400
Right now?

6200
04:46:42,520 --> 04:46:42,740
Okay.

6201
04:46:44,400 --> 04:46:45,240
Let's start with...

6202
04:46:45,240 --> 04:46:46,280
Bottom up again.

6203
04:46:46,780 --> 04:46:47,320
Bottoms up?

6204
04:46:48,460 --> 04:46:50,060
Sure has taken Camilla long enough.

6205
04:46:50,600 --> 04:46:51,840
She should have been here by now.

6206
04:46:52,040 --> 04:46:53,100
I'm getting really worried.

6207
04:46:53,240 --> 04:46:53,660
Me too.

6208
04:46:55,480 --> 04:46:56,580
You two are like sisters, aren't you?

6209
04:46:56,680 --> 04:46:57,740
That's what Camilla said.

6210
04:46:58,200 --> 04:46:58,680
Yep.

6211
04:46:58,900 --> 04:47:00,340
That just about sums it up.

6212
04:47:01,120 --> 04:47:02,320
It doesn't look like being...

6213
04:47:02,320 --> 04:47:05,840
It doesn't look like being worried affected your appetite much though.

6214
04:47:07,180 --> 04:47:09,860
Hey, the bigger the crisis, the more a girl's gotta eat.

6215
04:47:10,340 --> 04:47:11,100
So true.

6216
04:47:12,180 --> 04:47:14,680
I have to make sure Camilla stays safe, no matter what.

6217
04:47:15,320 --> 04:47:16,760
Camilla and that music box.

6218
04:47:16,860 --> 04:47:17,960
The music box.

6219
04:47:17,980 --> 04:47:18,400
Oh my gosh.

6220
04:47:18,460 --> 04:47:19,640
We got that last time.

6221
04:47:19,960 --> 04:47:22,200
It's been so long since we've heard about it.

6222
04:47:22,280 --> 04:47:22,900
Oh yeah.

6223
04:47:22,960 --> 04:47:23,920
That wooden box.

6224
04:47:24,860 --> 04:47:25,460
That wooden box.

6225
04:47:25,480 --> 04:47:25,500
That one.

6226
04:47:25,920 --> 04:47:26,400
Yeah.

6227
04:47:26,900 --> 04:47:27,560
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

6228
04:47:27,720 --> 04:47:28,180
Yippee.

6229
04:47:28,860 --> 04:47:31,760
That box was a present from Detective Chowd.

6230
04:47:32,520 --> 04:47:33,040
Oh.

6231
04:47:36,860 --> 04:47:38,620
From Detective Chowd.

6232
04:47:40,060 --> 04:47:40,580
Yes.

6233
04:47:40,580 --> 04:47:41,540
It was five years ago.

6234
04:47:41,700 --> 04:47:44,340
That box arrived three days after that murder incident.

6235
04:47:48,460 --> 04:47:48,980
Sorry.

6236
04:47:49,100 --> 04:47:50,380
I was just cooking in my brain.

6237
04:47:51,400 --> 04:47:53,720
He must have sent it just before he was arrested.

6238
04:47:54,040 --> 04:47:57,600
I was like, what if once the detective went to jail...

6239
04:47:57,600 --> 04:48:00,800
he, like, gave her away to another family...

6240
04:48:00,800 --> 04:48:02,780
and that's why her and Camilla are like sisters?

6241
04:48:03,900 --> 04:48:05,380
And, like, what if...

6242
04:48:06,560 --> 04:48:09,780
What if, um, Cecil was the father figure?

6243
04:48:12,200 --> 04:48:14,460
But she also didn't know who he was, so...

6244
04:48:14,460 --> 04:48:16,160
I guess that doesn't make sense.

6245
04:48:16,420 --> 04:48:16,640
Hmm.

6246
04:48:19,720 --> 04:48:21,860
He must have sent it just before he was arrested.

6247
04:48:23,160 --> 04:48:25,640
Someday when the case is over and everything is settled...

6248
04:48:25,640 --> 04:48:27,580
I want you to give this to a certain person.

6249
04:48:27,600 --> 04:48:28,140
He said.

6250
04:48:28,720 --> 04:48:29,120
Ooh.

6251
04:48:29,720 --> 04:48:30,560
So, what's inside?

6252
04:48:31,180 --> 04:48:31,740
Oh, no.

6253
04:48:31,840 --> 04:48:32,860
Was I the person?

6254
04:48:33,080 --> 04:48:34,260
Was Cecil the person?

6255
04:48:35,120 --> 04:48:35,780
I don't know.

6256
04:48:35,820 --> 04:48:36,580
I can't open it.

6257
04:48:37,460 --> 04:48:37,860
Hmm.

6258
04:48:37,980 --> 04:48:38,700
That's a shame.

6259
04:48:40,140 --> 04:48:40,540
Yeah.

6260
04:48:40,600 --> 04:48:41,740
She would have recognized him then.

6261
04:48:41,920 --> 04:48:42,220
Hmm.

6262
04:48:42,360 --> 04:48:42,720
Hmm.

6263
04:48:48,770 --> 04:48:49,910
She wouldn't have been that young?

6264
04:48:49,990 --> 04:48:50,890
It was only five years ago?

6265
04:48:51,550 --> 04:48:51,950
Oh.

6266
04:48:52,710 --> 04:48:53,710
I thought it happened...

6267
04:48:53,710 --> 04:48:55,210
I thought it happened a long time ago.

6268
04:48:55,570 --> 04:48:56,090
Oh, well.

6269
04:48:56,590 --> 04:48:58,950
Detective Ringe works for the Special Investigation Unit.

6270
04:48:59,690 --> 04:49:03,130
He said, He said an important deal is set to go down here tonight at this restaurant.

6271
04:49:03,950 --> 04:49:04,690
A deal?

6272
04:49:04,850 --> 04:49:07,510
Okay, then what if Camilla's the one that shot the guy?

6273
04:49:08,170 --> 04:49:09,770
That's Camilla's dad instead.

6274
04:49:11,870 --> 04:49:14,570
A deal that could affect the future of our nation.

6275
04:49:16,510 --> 04:49:19,070
A nation isn't something that's easily influenced, though.

6276
04:49:20,430 --> 04:49:21,770
But that's what he said.

6277
04:49:22,290 --> 04:49:24,470
Anyway, it's that couple at the table upstairs.

6278
04:49:26,690 --> 04:49:27,350
Oh, yeah.

6279
04:49:27,750 --> 04:49:29,070
I heard they're foreigners.

6280
04:49:29,730 --> 04:49:33,070
They're waiting for the other party in this deal to show up now.

6281
04:49:34,270 --> 04:49:35,270
Those two, huh?

6282
04:49:35,410 --> 04:49:37,070
They certainly are an odd pair.

6283
04:49:40,330 --> 04:49:42,310
Is this other party they're waiting for?

6284
04:49:43,250 --> 04:49:43,770
Watashi?

6285
04:49:44,910 --> 04:49:46,510
This is a blue people country.

6286
04:49:48,150 --> 04:49:49,930
They're all just smurfs, you guys.

6287
04:49:50,430 --> 04:49:52,390
They're just big smurfs.

6288
04:49:52,590 --> 04:49:59,050
Don't you know that because there's so much pollution that has happened, the smurfs have mutated?

6289
04:49:59,070 --> 04:50:00,950
They've mutated into full-sized people.

6290
04:50:01,430 --> 04:50:01,910
Okay?

6291
04:50:02,730 --> 04:50:04,290
Moshikashite watashi.

6292
04:50:12,800 --> 04:50:15,520
Too much raspberry slurpees country.

6293
04:50:18,360 --> 04:50:19,960
Are they still blue?

6294
04:50:20,200 --> 04:50:20,480
Yes.

6295
04:50:21,670 --> 04:50:22,560
That's why they're blue.

6296
04:50:22,740 --> 04:50:25,420
They're just freakishly large smurfs now.

6297
04:50:26,080 --> 04:50:28,140
But average human size.

6298
04:50:28,580 --> 04:50:29,900
But freakishly...

6299
04:50:29,900 --> 04:50:32,500
Really giant, large smurfs.

6300
04:50:32,500 --> 04:50:35,960
Every smurf with the giantest fetish is like, Woohoo!

6301
04:50:36,420 --> 04:50:36,940
Yeah!

6302
04:50:37,940 --> 04:50:40,600
But every other smurf is like, Oh no!

6303
04:50:41,320 --> 04:50:42,320
Oh my god.

6304
04:50:42,380 --> 04:50:44,220
This is ruining our lives.

6305
04:50:44,720 --> 04:50:46,420
We can't even go back home.

6306
04:50:46,460 --> 04:50:48,040
We just squish our families.

6307
04:50:48,660 --> 04:50:49,180
No!

6308
04:50:49,620 --> 04:50:50,640
That's what's happening.

6309
04:50:56,660 --> 04:50:58,660
It's kind of hard to imagine, isn't it?

6310
04:50:59,080 --> 04:51:00,180
The smurfs.

6311
04:51:00,260 --> 04:51:01,380
The smurf population.

6312
04:51:02,440 --> 04:51:04,640
Sorry, I'm mixing up all my conversations.

6313
04:51:09,380 --> 04:51:12,080
Nobody really knows any of the details of the deal.

6314
04:51:12,180 --> 04:51:13,200
Except for one person.

6315
04:51:15,560 --> 04:51:17,780
Our favorite guy!

6316
04:51:18,900 --> 04:51:21,200
Mr. Breezy Dancer in a white suit.

6317
04:51:21,700 --> 04:51:23,720
They say he's been watching the movements.

6318
04:51:24,040 --> 04:51:25,620
He's been watching his movements.

6319
04:51:25,960 --> 04:51:27,700
Of those two for a long time.

6320
04:51:30,720 --> 04:51:33,840
I've never seen him work so frantically on an investigation before.

6321
04:51:35,480 --> 04:51:36,560
Inspector Cabanela, eh?

6322
04:51:37,280 --> 04:51:39,020
Apparently, you're a real favorite of his.

6323
04:51:39,540 --> 04:51:40,340
A favorite?

6324
04:51:40,520 --> 04:51:42,040
Yes, well, there's a reason for that.

6325
04:51:42,640 --> 04:51:43,520
And what's that?

6326
04:51:45,660 --> 04:51:46,860
Uh, the reason?

6327
04:51:49,940 --> 04:51:52,320
Inspector Cabanela and Detective Jowd were good friends.

6328
04:51:53,880 --> 04:51:56,580
Yeah, I think I remember the prison guard saying something about that.

6329
04:51:59,140 --> 04:52:00,540
Oh, my gosh!

6330
04:52:01,500 --> 04:52:02,060
Gumshoe!

6331
04:52:02,980 --> 04:52:05,700
They joined the detective division the very same day.

6332
04:52:06,800 --> 04:52:11,620
They're two very different types, but they were always in friendly competition to be the best.

6333
04:52:18,500 --> 04:52:23,180
Detective Jowd was always very particular about and thorough investigation of the crime scene.

6334
04:52:24,360 --> 04:52:24,920
Heya!

6335
04:52:25,020 --> 04:52:25,200
Oh!

6336
04:52:25,340 --> 04:52:25,600
Ha!

6337
04:52:25,700 --> 04:52:25,900
Oh!

6338
04:52:25,960 --> 04:52:26,460
Oh!

6339
04:52:26,460 --> 04:52:26,560
Oh!

6340
04:53:02,920 --> 04:53:03,400
Well,

6341
04:53:06,540 --> 04:53:09,100
maybe he's also trying to move... I keep switching sides.

6342
04:53:09,320 --> 04:53:10,260
I'm like, he did it!

6343
04:53:10,360 --> 04:53:10,780
No!

6344
04:53:11,140 --> 04:53:12,160
He's a good guy!

6345
04:53:12,540 --> 04:53:14,700
He's trying to... he's framing him!

6346
04:53:15,820 --> 04:53:16,240
No!

6347
04:53:16,460 --> 04:53:18,720
He's trying to find a way to get him out of jail!

6348
04:53:20,280 --> 04:53:23,660
Little A, but before I go to bed, I just want to say big congrats on 200k!

6349
04:53:23,960 --> 04:53:25,280
Damn it, you're pretty good.

6350
04:53:25,500 --> 04:53:26,660
Thanks, ghost of me!

6351
04:53:27,740 --> 04:53:28,540
Ghost of me?

6352
04:53:28,820 --> 04:53:29,660
Ghost of ghost.

6353
04:53:30,020 --> 04:53:30,680
Good night!

6354
04:53:30,880 --> 04:53:31,640
Good night, good night.

6355
04:53:36,620 --> 04:53:42,060
Now I'm just like, is he moving up the ladder because he wants to be the top dog to not give that guy the death penalty?

6356
04:53:46,530 --> 04:53:49,270
So that's how he became head of the special investigation unit.

6357
04:53:49,350 --> 04:53:49,850
I take it.

6358
04:53:50,910 --> 04:53:53,250
Anyway, Inspector Cabanela took me under his wing.

6359
04:53:54,070 --> 04:53:56,630
Because you were the little girl his good friend had saved, huh?

6360
04:53:57,630 --> 04:54:01,110
He really looked out for me, helping me study for my detective's exam.

6361
04:54:02,190 --> 04:54:04,710
Fudging my exam score...

6362
04:54:04,710 --> 04:54:05,330
What

6363
04:54:09,480 --> 04:54:11,840
do you mean by that, Lin?

6364
04:54:16,760 --> 04:54:19,160
No, no, no, no, no, no.

6365
04:54:19,300 --> 04:54:23,540
Lin, Lin, Lin, Lin, you didn't... you, you put... you passed.

6366
04:54:25,500 --> 04:54:27,220
We don't have someone out here...

6367
04:54:27,240 --> 04:54:34,140
A detective out here who... who... who is... she's perfectly capable, everybody.

6368
04:54:35,860 --> 04:54:37,420
Lin Neppo, baby.

6369
04:54:39,260 --> 04:54:42,820
That goes a little beyond the scope of looking out for you.

6370
04:54:44,240 --> 04:54:45,800
Inspector Cabanela, eh?

6371
04:54:46,120 --> 04:54:50,680
I wonder what role he plays in everything that's happening tonight.

6372
04:54:53,080 --> 04:54:54,240
Okay, okay.

6373
04:55:00,510 --> 04:55:03,570
I can't... I wasn't expecting nepotism.

6374
04:55:03,750 --> 04:55:05,310
What is going on?

6375
04:55:05,610 --> 04:55:08,210
Alright, death row inmate Joward... Jowd.

6376
04:55:08,530 --> 04:55:12,650
What is your connection to prisoner D-99, Detective Jowd?

6377
04:55:12,930 --> 04:55:15,090
He seems like more than just a co-worker.

6378
04:55:16,770 --> 04:55:18,550
Yes, I suppose you have the right to know.

6379
04:55:19,730 --> 04:55:21,430
Detective Jowd is my hero.

6380
04:55:23,890 --> 04:55:24,650
Hero, huh?

6381
04:55:24,830 --> 04:55:26,510
You don't hear that word much anymore.

6382
04:55:27,930 --> 04:55:28,470
Hahaha.

6383
04:55:29,210 --> 04:55:31,130
She's cute, so I'll allow it.

6384
04:55:32,310 --> 04:55:34,890
It's like finding out your doctor used chat GPT.

6385
04:55:35,330 --> 04:55:37,010
Oh god, you're right.

6386
04:55:38,830 --> 04:55:43,430
It's like, oh, I just googled it on WebMD, obviously.

6387
04:55:45,310 --> 04:55:48,410
It's an old-fashioned hero kind of... heroic kind of story.

6388
04:55:48,610 --> 04:55:50,030
It happened ten years ago.

6389
04:55:51,630 --> 04:55:53,790
Now, just calm down and drop that weapon.

6390
04:55:54,710 --> 04:55:55,490
Stay back.

6391
04:55:55,650 --> 04:55:57,810
If you come any closer, I'll shoot her.

6392
04:56:05,300 --> 04:56:05,900
Okay.

6393
04:56:05,900 --> 04:56:10,920
On that day, ten years ago, I was playing in my favorite park.

6394
04:56:12,600 --> 04:56:15,960
And then suddenly, somebody grabbed my arm from behind.

6395
04:56:17,200 --> 04:56:20,240
I was so scared, I thought I was going to die.

6396
04:56:22,120 --> 04:56:23,120
And then...

6397
04:56:27,680 --> 04:56:28,700
He appeared.

6398
04:56:28,940 --> 04:56:30,220
Detective Jowd!

6399
04:56:31,780 --> 04:56:32,380
Ugh.

6400
04:56:37,060 --> 04:56:39,440
And then, that really loud sound.

6401
04:56:39,580 --> 04:56:41,000
I think it was the sound of a gun.

6402
04:56:42,520 --> 04:56:43,620
I passed out.

6403
04:56:44,540 --> 04:56:45,920
When I came to...

6404
04:56:47,540 --> 04:56:48,660
Oh my gosh, his baby.

6405
04:56:50,580 --> 04:56:51,720
You're all right now.

6406
04:56:52,120 --> 04:56:53,000
Are you hurt?

6407
04:56:54,920 --> 04:56:56,900
Y-you saved me, mister.

6408
04:56:57,440 --> 04:56:59,340
Oh my god, she woke up with a British accent.

6409
04:56:59,900 --> 04:57:01,480
I was just doing my job.

6410
04:57:02,140 --> 04:57:02,900
The gods.

6411
04:57:03,540 --> 04:57:05,080
They're the ones who saved you.

6412
04:57:06,520 --> 04:57:07,800
What's your job, mister?

6413
04:57:09,280 --> 04:57:09,800
Me?

6414
04:57:09,800 --> 04:57:11,020
I'm a police detective.

6415
04:57:11,260 --> 04:57:11,900
What is that?

6416
04:57:12,080 --> 04:57:13,160
There was like...

6417
04:57:13,160 --> 04:57:15,120
One of the... Oh my gosh.

6418
04:57:15,420 --> 04:57:16,420
One of the...

6419
04:57:17,540 --> 04:57:19,800
I think it was like a movie recently.

6420
04:57:19,840 --> 04:57:22,340
The one with like beatboxing puppy or whatever.

6421
04:57:23,120 --> 04:57:24,340
If you've heard of that.

6422
04:57:25,220 --> 04:57:25,740
Like...

6423
04:57:25,740 --> 04:57:28,700
In the beginning of the movie, she has like a...

6424
04:57:28,700 --> 04:57:30,020
A British accent.

6425
04:57:30,100 --> 04:57:30,960
And then...

6426
04:57:30,960 --> 04:57:32,720
And then like...

6427
04:57:32,720 --> 04:57:36,180
As part of like the lore explanation, she was like...

6428
04:57:36,580 --> 04:57:37,420
When I...

6429
04:57:37,420 --> 04:57:38,900
When I...

6430
04:57:38,900 --> 04:57:41,420
When I grew up, I lost my accent.

6431
04:57:41,640 --> 04:57:43,860
And it was very clearly like...

6432
04:57:44,720 --> 04:57:47,620
Like they didn't want to pay another British...

6433
04:57:47,620 --> 04:57:51,700
Another actor to do like a British accent when she was an adult or something.

6434
04:57:52,720 --> 04:57:54,600
Not the beatboxing puppy.

6435
04:57:58,540 --> 04:58:01,460
It's the same thing except opposite here.

6436
04:58:02,720 --> 04:58:05,580
She got scared so badly, she developed a British accent.

6437
04:58:08,780 --> 04:58:10,620
That whole movie is literally AI?

6438
04:58:11,020 --> 04:58:12,880
I don't think it was though, wasn't it?

6439
04:58:13,280 --> 04:58:14,140
Like the...

6440
04:58:14,580 --> 04:58:18,380
Apparently it was some YouTuber that had been like creating it for a really long time.

6441
04:58:18,520 --> 04:58:19,440
And was like...

6442
04:58:19,440 --> 04:58:20,900
This is my...

6443
04:58:21,660 --> 04:58:22,280
Masterpiece movie!

6444
04:58:22,820 --> 04:58:24,560
But it was just not good movie.

6445
04:58:28,460 --> 04:58:28,980
Anyway...

6446
04:58:28,980 --> 04:58:29,540
Me?

6447
04:58:29,860 --> 04:58:31,040
I'm a police detective.

6448
04:58:35,430 --> 04:58:35,870
Okay.

6449
04:58:36,410 --> 04:58:38,370
So that's why you became a detective, huh?

6450
04:58:39,250 --> 04:58:39,870
That's right.

6451
04:58:40,030 --> 04:58:42,370
He was my ideal of what a detective was all about.

6452
04:58:43,230 --> 04:58:46,090
But an ideal detective doesn't shoot and kill his own wife.

6453
04:58:46,650 --> 04:58:47,090
True.

6454
04:58:48,350 --> 04:58:48,790
Exactly.

6455
04:58:53,590 --> 04:58:54,750
That's why I didn't want...

6456
04:58:54,750 --> 04:58:57,050
That's why I want to prove that he didn't.

6457
04:58:59,310 --> 04:59:00,130
Cecil, I...

6458
04:59:00,850 --> 04:59:02,270
Did I really shoot you?

6459
04:59:02,450 --> 04:59:03,210
Oh my gosh.

6460
04:59:04,870 --> 04:59:06,430
She is just like her hero.

6461
04:59:09,430 --> 04:59:11,710
Where did that come from out of the blue?

6462
04:59:12,310 --> 04:59:13,570
I really don't remember.

6463
04:59:14,130 --> 04:59:16,290
I've tried and tried but I just can't.

6464
04:59:16,930 --> 04:59:19,210
Now I finally understand how you must feel.

6465
04:59:20,370 --> 04:59:22,470
And how hard it is to have your memory gone.

6466
04:59:22,610 --> 04:59:23,690
Your story erased.

6467
04:59:25,390 --> 04:59:26,290
But who knows?

6468
04:59:26,650 --> 04:59:28,390
Knowing the truth might be even harder.

6469
04:59:29,210 --> 04:59:30,990
I'd rather believe there's hope myself.

6470
04:59:34,090 --> 04:59:34,490
Nice.

6471
04:59:36,110 --> 04:59:38,070
We should almost be done with this chapter though, right?

6472
04:59:39,050 --> 04:59:39,450
Dang!

6473
04:59:39,590 --> 04:59:40,390
She ate the whole thing!

6474
04:59:41,250 --> 04:59:42,470
That was great!

6475
04:59:44,310 --> 04:59:45,730
Do I have chicken on my face?

6476
04:59:45,890 --> 04:59:46,370
You're staring.

6477
04:59:48,450 --> 04:59:52,030
I bet you're thinking about how impressed you are with the way I took care of that chicken.

6478
04:59:53,050 --> 04:59:54,230
Just tell me one thing.

6479
04:59:55,090 --> 04:59:57,190
This case you say you're looking into...

6480
04:59:58,330 --> 04:59:59,770
Is it Detective Jouds?

6481
05:00:04,420 --> 05:00:05,460
What if it was?

6482
05:00:07,260 --> 05:00:09,040
I... I can't keep it from you.

6483
05:00:09,160 --> 05:00:10,080
It's too cruel.

6484
05:00:10,260 --> 05:00:10,760
Uh-oh.

6485
05:00:11,480 --> 05:00:13,840
Oh no, he's about to die before he tells us the information.

6486
05:00:15,120 --> 05:00:16,540
What are you talking about?

6487
05:00:17,300 --> 05:00:18,180
I'm sorry, Lin.

6488
05:00:18,240 --> 05:00:19,480
It's... it's tonight.

6489
05:00:20,380 --> 05:00:22,300
Oh, oh, okay, okay, never mind.

6490
05:00:22,560 --> 05:00:23,420
His execution.

6491
05:00:23,660 --> 05:00:24,840
Detective Jouds, you know...

6492
05:00:25,340 --> 05:00:26,080
It's tonight.

6493
05:00:26,660 --> 05:00:27,580
His execution.

6494
05:00:30,580 --> 05:00:31,640
But there's still time.

6495
05:00:32,140 --> 05:00:37,560
I looked into it and I found out all the executions in this country are carried out at dawn.

6496
05:00:39,120 --> 05:00:40,720
That may be the norm, but...

6497
05:00:40,720 --> 05:00:43,380
Not this time, I'm afraid.

6498
05:00:44,740 --> 05:00:45,220
What?

6499
05:00:46,380 --> 05:00:49,380
The execution is set for 11 p.m.

6500
05:00:49,380 --> 05:00:50,700
Oh my gosh, wasn't it 9?

6501
05:00:51,760 --> 05:00:52,700
What did you say?

6502
05:00:53,180 --> 05:00:54,900
It's going to happen pretty soon.

6503
05:00:56,220 --> 05:00:56,700
Oh!

6504
05:00:58,520 --> 05:01:00,440
Isn't there anything we can do to stop it?

6505
05:01:01,640 --> 05:01:02,900
Of course not.

6506
05:01:03,040 --> 05:01:03,980
It's too late now.

6507
05:01:06,700 --> 05:01:09,440
Not without a stay of execution from the Justice Minister.

6508
05:01:11,940 --> 05:01:13,280
I'm going to see him then.

6509
05:01:14,600 --> 05:01:15,120
What?

6510
05:01:15,200 --> 05:01:15,580
See who?

6511
05:01:16,060 --> 05:01:16,840
Who else?

6512
05:01:16,880 --> 05:01:17,800
The Justice Minister!

6513
05:01:19,420 --> 05:01:20,380
Don't be ridiculous!

6514
05:01:20,680 --> 05:01:21,640
There's not enough time!

6515
05:01:22,520 --> 05:01:23,320
I'm going!

6516
05:01:24,300 --> 05:01:24,820
Cecil!

6517
05:01:25,420 --> 05:01:25,940
Me?

6518
05:01:26,700 --> 05:01:27,680
Get to the prison!

6519
05:01:27,800 --> 05:01:28,580
Stop that execution!

6520
05:01:29,780 --> 05:01:31,000
Easy enough for you to say.

6521
05:01:31,900 --> 05:01:33,160
Detective Ranger, I'll be going now.

6522
05:01:34,420 --> 05:01:35,740
Okay, I'll let you go this time.

6523
05:01:36,040 --> 05:01:38,260
I'll tell him I was distracted because I was eating chicken.

6524
05:01:41,900 --> 05:01:42,880
He's a good guy.

6525
05:01:42,920 --> 05:01:43,620
He's a good guy.

6526
05:01:45,460 --> 05:01:46,720
Is there anything else I can do?

6527
05:01:47,560 --> 05:01:48,480
Could you find Camilla?

6528
05:01:48,720 --> 05:01:50,080
She's supposed to be on her way here.

6529
05:01:51,600 --> 05:01:52,560
Oh, your little Camilla?

6530
05:01:53,080 --> 05:01:54,160
Okay, you got it.

6531
05:01:54,260 --> 05:01:55,040
I'll look for her.

6532
05:01:55,940 --> 05:01:56,260
Okay.

6533
05:01:56,420 --> 05:01:57,480
You know what to do, Cecil.

6534
05:01:57,480 --> 05:01:59,020
You have to save Detective Jowd!

6535
05:02:01,280 --> 05:02:01,780
Runs away.

6536
05:02:03,280 --> 05:02:03,760
Yippee!

6537
05:02:05,860 --> 05:02:11,060
The life of yet another person I'm connected to is somehow about to end tonight.

6538
05:02:11,400 --> 05:02:12,540
Could it be a coincidence?

6539
05:02:12,960 --> 05:02:14,780
Or is there something more behind it all?

6540
05:02:16,620 --> 05:02:19,000
Detective Jowd is destined to be executed tonight.

6541
05:02:19,460 --> 05:02:23,180
I don't know if that fate is the wrong one for him or the right one.

6542
05:02:23,520 --> 05:02:25,420
But I've decided to go to the prison anyway.

6543
05:02:31,910 --> 05:02:32,470
Okay...

6544
05:02:35,750 --> 05:02:36,590
Wait, I'm sorry.

6545
05:02:36,690 --> 05:02:39,290
The 10.05 to 10.55 chat...

6546
05:02:39,290 --> 05:02:39,730
Okay, wait.

6547
05:02:39,890 --> 05:02:41,790
So it's supposed to happen in five minutes?

6548
05:02:41,890 --> 05:02:42,570
No way.

6549
05:02:46,030 --> 05:02:52,910
This is... I'm glad that we just finished because my throat has been killing me.

6550
05:02:55,250 --> 05:02:56,790
I think it's...

6551
05:02:58,950 --> 05:03:00,470
a good point to end.

6552
05:03:06,690 --> 05:03:07,110
Wait...

6553
05:03:08,510 --> 05:03:08,930
Oh!

6554
05:03:09,510 --> 05:03:10,270
Sorry, my bad.

6555
05:03:10,330 --> 05:03:11,810
I just realized I just turned off the music.

6556
05:03:11,970 --> 05:03:12,970
I turned off the wrong thing.

6557
05:03:14,350 --> 05:03:15,070
There we go.

6558
05:03:15,190 --> 05:03:15,450
Okay.

6559
05:03:16,510 --> 05:03:17,570
You're leaving us?

6560
05:03:17,690 --> 05:03:18,050
Yeah.

6561
05:03:18,470 --> 05:03:18,890
Sorry.

6562
05:03:20,430 --> 05:03:21,450
This is so fun!

6563
05:03:21,650 --> 05:03:23,470
I hope you guys are enjoying the story so far.

6564
05:03:23,990 --> 05:03:24,690
What are we?

6565
05:03:25,110 --> 05:03:25,890
Chapter select?

6566
05:03:30,490 --> 05:03:31,330
Thank you!

6567
05:03:31,450 --> 05:03:33,570
So we're at Chapter 8 out of 18.

6568
05:03:34,890 --> 05:03:35,310
So...

6569
05:03:35,310 --> 05:03:36,990
Gosh, there's still so much to go!

6570
05:03:37,410 --> 05:03:38,630
There's still so much to go.

6571
05:03:39,810 --> 05:03:41,230
I'm really invested in the story now.

6572
05:03:41,330 --> 05:03:41,910
Thanks for the stream.

6573
05:03:41,970 --> 05:03:43,190
I hope you have a restful sleep tonight.

6574
05:03:43,570 --> 05:03:44,130
Thank you!

6575
05:03:45,990 --> 05:03:47,130
Thanks for the stream, Tensai.

6576
05:03:47,210 --> 05:03:48,290
Cute, odd, ghost detective.

6577
05:03:48,610 --> 05:03:49,870
Looking forward to more of this game.

6578
05:03:49,990 --> 05:03:50,770
Thank you so much!

6579
05:03:50,990 --> 05:03:51,750
Yeah, we're not even...

6580
05:03:52,290 --> 05:03:53,910
We're not even halfway, man.

6581
05:03:53,990 --> 05:03:54,470
That's crazy.

6582
05:03:56,230 --> 05:03:58,570
So probably two, three more streams.

6583
05:04:01,330 --> 05:04:02,530
I'm gonna aim for two, though.

6584
05:04:02,570 --> 05:04:03,270
I'm gonna aim for two.

6585
05:04:03,270 --> 05:04:05,970
I would like to finish it before I leave for...

6586
05:04:05,970 --> 05:04:08,010
I can finish it before I leave for Off-Kai.

6587
05:04:08,130 --> 05:04:09,130
For sure, for sure, for sure.

6588
05:04:11,290 --> 05:04:11,690
Yeah.

6589
05:04:11,690 --> 05:04:12,970
The rabbit hole is deep.

6590
05:04:13,050 --> 05:04:13,610
It is!

6591
05:04:13,630 --> 05:04:14,150
It is!

6592
05:04:15,530 --> 05:04:15,930
Nice!

6593
05:04:17,650 --> 05:04:22,250
But yeah, for those who are watching the story for the first time, I hope you're liking it.

6594
05:04:22,590 --> 05:04:23,630
For those who...

6595
05:04:25,330 --> 05:04:28,330
For those who are...

6596
05:04:31,530 --> 05:04:35,450
...fans of the game or played it before, I hope you are liking my playthrough.

6597
05:04:35,630 --> 05:04:42,470
Hopefully my brain is expanding at enough rate for your... to be satisfying.

6598
05:04:43,030 --> 05:04:43,790
Thanks for the stream.

6599
05:04:43,830 --> 05:04:45,010
I love this game so much.

6600
05:04:45,110 --> 05:04:46,110
Glad you're enjoying it.

6601
05:04:46,130 --> 05:04:47,430
Tomorrow I have an exam and I'm pretty nervous.

6602
05:04:47,470 --> 05:04:47,810
Wish me luck.

6603
05:04:47,990 --> 05:04:49,270
Good luck, Conqueror!

6604
05:04:49,370 --> 05:04:51,790
You are the Conqueror with the Von Karma...

6605
05:04:52,510 --> 05:04:54,190
...Francisco Von Karma profile picture.

6606
05:04:54,290 --> 05:04:55,250
You've got this!

6607
05:04:55,450 --> 05:04:56,390
You've got this!

6608
05:05:00,790 --> 05:05:01,990
You're going at a pretty good pace.

6609
05:05:02,270 --> 05:05:03,730
Says guy who loves this game.

6610
05:05:05,050 --> 05:05:05,930
Cool, cool, cool.

6611
05:05:06,430 --> 05:05:08,370
I'm gonna go get some more tea.

6612
05:05:08,590 --> 05:05:09,790
And I'm gonna go to sleep.

6613
05:05:09,910 --> 05:05:10,730
What am I doing tomorrow?

6614
05:05:11,330 --> 05:05:11,910
Hold on.

6615
05:05:12,750 --> 05:05:14,050
Checking my schedule real quick.

6616
05:05:18,910 --> 05:05:19,310
Shashingo!

6617
05:05:19,830 --> 05:05:23,270
Which if you're not aware of what that game is, it's basically...

6618
05:05:23,270 --> 05:05:25,930
...a game where you take pictures and learn stuff in Japanese.

6619
05:05:26,310 --> 05:05:27,650
So we can learn Nihongo.

6620
05:05:28,330 --> 05:05:30,110
Let's learn Nihongo together!

6621
05:05:31,650 --> 05:05:32,090
Yeah!

6622
05:05:33,250 --> 05:05:34,770
Thank you for the super chat!

6623
05:05:35,470 --> 05:05:37,050
Mike Taishan, thank you for the super chat!

6624
05:05:37,590 --> 05:05:38,570
Hope you have a good night.

6625
05:05:38,650 --> 05:05:39,090
You too!

6626
05:05:40,930 --> 05:05:41,990
You too, you too!

6627
05:05:42,830 --> 05:05:43,710
Yeah, so...

6628
05:05:44,270 --> 05:05:45,930
Let's learn Nihongo together!

6629
05:05:48,170 --> 05:05:50,870
I was wondering if you've listened to Atarashii Gakko.

6630
05:05:51,830 --> 05:05:53,790
I know they're not really the typical idol group.

6631
05:05:53,850 --> 05:05:54,230
Just wondering.

6632
05:05:54,350 --> 05:05:54,670
I have!

6633
05:05:54,770 --> 05:05:56,170
I have listened to them a little bit.

6634
05:05:56,410 --> 05:05:57,350
Thanks for the super chat!

6635
05:05:57,350 --> 05:05:58,290
Congrats on 200k!

6636
05:05:58,350 --> 05:05:58,790
Thank you!

6637
05:06:00,610 --> 05:06:01,470
Actually, I...

6638
05:06:02,470 --> 05:06:03,270
Oh my gosh.

6639
05:06:03,290 --> 05:06:05,550
I have pictures from an old...

6640
05:06:05,550 --> 05:06:06,290
Let me see.

6641
05:06:06,490 --> 05:06:09,310
I have to check how long ago this was.

6642
05:06:10,670 --> 05:06:11,450
That I...

6643
05:06:11,450 --> 05:06:13,070
I didn't realize it was...

6644
05:06:13,070 --> 05:06:13,630
Like I...

6645
05:06:13,630 --> 05:06:14,190
I had...

6646
05:06:14,830 --> 05:06:15,870
I had...

6647
05:06:17,050 --> 05:06:19,530
I had gone to the exhibit for something else.

6648
05:06:20,830 --> 05:06:23,310
But it was a collaboration with them as well.

6649
05:06:23,530 --> 05:06:25,310
It was like them and another brand.

6650
05:06:26,310 --> 05:06:27,330
Back in...

6651
05:06:30,130 --> 05:06:31,370
I'm looking through my pictures.

6652
05:06:31,590 --> 05:06:31,750
Oh.

6653
05:06:34,590 --> 05:06:35,350
Oh, wait.

6654
05:06:35,610 --> 05:06:39,550
I posted the picture in 2016 but it said throwback.

6655
05:06:42,330 --> 05:06:44,350
So actually, I'm not sure.

6656
05:06:45,810 --> 05:06:48,570
When I posted the picture, it says throwback.

6657
05:06:50,690 --> 05:06:53,310
So actually, I don't know at all when this...

6658
05:06:54,090 --> 05:06:55,590
It might have been 2016.

6659
05:06:55,850 --> 05:06:56,630
That sounds right.

6660
05:06:59,410 --> 05:07:00,210
But yeah.

6661
05:07:00,370 --> 05:07:01,630
So I've known about them for a while.

6662
05:07:01,870 --> 05:07:02,090
But...

6663
05:07:02,090 --> 05:07:04,070
So it's really crazy to see that they...

6664
05:07:04,070 --> 05:07:05,430
But I never listened to them back then.

6665
05:07:05,470 --> 05:07:06,450
I was never like a huge fan.

6666
05:07:06,650 --> 05:07:09,690
But it's really crazy to see how popular they've become now.

6667
05:07:09,970 --> 05:07:10,930
They're like everywhere.

6668
05:07:13,830 --> 05:07:14,890
Eight years ago.

6669
05:07:15,190 --> 05:07:15,990
Yeah, right?

6670
05:07:19,930 --> 05:07:20,330
Okay.

6671
05:07:20,810 --> 05:07:23,550
I'm gonna go rest you guys as well.

6672
05:07:24,730 --> 05:07:26,710
I'll try to wear Ace Combat merch at Off-Kai.

6673
05:07:26,790 --> 05:07:27,310
I hope you will see me there.

6674
05:07:27,310 --> 05:07:29,310
But if unable to meet you during meet and greet...

6675
05:07:30,330 --> 05:07:33,190
Or unable to see me, I will post my merch on Twitter after...

6676
05:07:33,190 --> 05:07:33,390
Yeah!

6677
05:07:33,670 --> 05:07:34,210
Post it!

6678
05:07:34,270 --> 05:07:34,690
Post it!

6679
05:07:35,070 --> 05:07:36,910
I will be at Off-Kai.

6680
05:07:37,870 --> 05:07:42,150
Bishoujo is very kind enough to let me be in one of the little robots as well.

6681
05:07:42,850 --> 05:07:45,470
So Matara and I will be going around in our robots.

6682
05:07:45,890 --> 05:07:48,430
And if you don't get a meet and greet...

6683
05:07:48,430 --> 05:07:50,590
If you can't go to the con...

6684
05:07:52,150 --> 05:07:52,550
Sorry.

6685
05:07:54,010 --> 05:07:56,810
But if you don't get a meet and greet at the con...

6686
05:07:57,310 --> 05:07:58,870
We will be...

6687
05:07:59,910 --> 05:08:01,750
We'll be also going around as well.

6688
05:08:03,050 --> 05:08:04,470
They sold out?

6689
05:08:05,610 --> 05:08:06,610
What the...

6690
05:08:07,250 --> 05:08:08,390
The meet and greets?

6691
05:08:14,910 --> 05:08:16,030
The meet and greets?

6692
05:08:18,170 --> 05:08:19,730
Oh, the con sold out!

6693
05:08:23,150 --> 05:08:26,290
I was gonna say, I don't think the meet and greets are sold.

6694
05:08:26,810 --> 05:08:27,530
They're a lottery.

6695
05:08:32,750 --> 05:08:33,870
But also...

6696
05:08:34,510 --> 05:08:36,390
If you can't make it to Off-Kai...

6697
05:08:37,470 --> 05:08:40,190
Maybe another time and place.

6698
05:08:41,490 --> 05:08:42,050
Hopefully.

6699
05:08:42,830 --> 05:08:44,230
We'll do our best.

6700
05:08:45,670 --> 05:08:46,810
We'll do our best.

6701
05:08:46,910 --> 05:08:47,470
We'll do our best.

6702
05:08:48,090 --> 05:08:48,650
Yeah.

6703
05:08:53,030 --> 05:08:53,590
Um...

6704
05:08:53,590 --> 05:08:54,590
But yeah!

6705
05:08:55,430 --> 05:08:56,390
Otsuminto everybody!

6706
05:08:56,870 --> 05:08:59,090
Thank you so much for joining me again today!

6707
05:08:59,690 --> 05:09:01,590
And we will finish the game!

6708
05:09:02,170 --> 05:09:02,730
Uh...

6709
05:09:03,230 --> 05:09:03,670
Eventually.

6710
05:09:05,470 --> 05:09:08,090
Can you and Matara do like BattleBots and fight each other?

6711
05:09:08,190 --> 05:09:08,890
I sure hope so.

6712
05:09:09,910 --> 05:09:12,230
I demand Mint to fly to our houses in drone form.

6713
05:09:12,350 --> 05:09:13,630
For all the people who missed it.

6714
05:09:15,510 --> 05:09:17,150
Hey, I possess you guys sometimes.

6715
05:09:17,390 --> 05:09:17,930
Isn't that enough?

6716
05:09:18,830 --> 05:09:19,270
Okay.

6717
05:09:21,910 --> 05:09:22,350
Oh...

6718
05:09:22,350 --> 05:09:23,370
It's late.

6719
05:09:24,490 --> 05:09:26,050
Get a lot of rest, you guys!

6720
05:09:26,290 --> 05:09:26,730
Otsuminto!

6721
05:09:26,910 --> 05:09:27,310
Otsuminto!

6722
05:09:27,410 --> 05:09:27,830
Otsuminto!

6723
05:09:28,030 --> 05:09:28,790
Bye-bye!

6724
05:09:29,250 --> 05:09:29,610
Bye-bye!

6725
05:09:29,830 --> 05:09:30,710
Have a good night!

6726
05:09:30,810 --> 05:09:31,390
Have a good night!

6727
