1
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

2
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,050
We're okay.

3
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:47,210
Oh, o, o, oh, o, o, o, Okizen-sama.

4
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:49,590
Hello.

5
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,860
Hi.

6
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,840
Hello.

7
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,380
I'm Mir consultation.

8
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,080
Hello.

9
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Okairi!

10
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,600
Okairi!

11
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,340
Okairi!

12
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,680
What's so funny?

13
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,020
I did this.

14
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,900
You hear it?

15
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,820
You like that?

16
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,040
I like the double audio?

17
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,700
Kinda sounds cool now, actually.

18
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,220
Wait, you guys don't hear the double audio?

19
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,070
Congrats on 200k!

20
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,370
Thank you!

21
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,950
Thank you, thank you!

22
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,270
No?

23
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,670
The whole time you've heard the single audio?

24
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,350
That's so weird.

25
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,190
Don't hear it double.

26
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,730
Definitely double.

27
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,350
Yeah, it was double for a second.

28
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,350
I heard it at the start.

29
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,970
Okay, I feel like I'm going crazy.

30
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,450
You guys like the new emo?

31
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:54,690
It's...

32
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,150
Excuse me, waiter.

33
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,230
This ghost is too tricky.

34
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,730
Busting.

35
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,750
Do you like them?

36
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,130
They're so fun.

37
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,870
Thank you, Tuna.

38
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,050
Thank you, Walfi.

39
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,050
Where the new ones?

40
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,770
This is not all of them.

41
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,130
There will be more.

42
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,830
Sai, welcome to the membership.

43
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:19,570
Oh my gosh.

44
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:20,450
Wow.

45
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,970
The ring taco.

46
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,130
Thank you for the birthday gift.

47
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,370
Thank you so much.

48
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,170
Thank you.

49
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,270
Amy, thank you for the gift.

50
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,650
Thank you, guys.

51
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,850
Thank you, thank you.

52
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,910
Yeah.

53
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,270
More?

54
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,070
Yeah, I'm gonna get more.

55
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,550
I have, um...

56
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,410
I don't remember how many more slots I have.

57
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,270
But I have more.

58
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:43,910
Hmm.

59
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,270
I have to get the...

60
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,770
Get them commissioned.

61
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:49,890
Fun!

62
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,810
Thank you for the 10!

63
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,650
Thank you!

64
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,310
Thank you so much for the 10 gifting.

65
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,110
Thank you so much.

66
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,010
Um... All the slots for sure.

67
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,010
I think so.

68
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,670
I think so.

69
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,710
I don't know...

70
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:15,090
I don't remember how many it is exactly but um earlier
actually just a half hour ago I got off um with a finishing

71
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:25,150
recording with Mataro the next podcast episode and we had
talked like for two hours before that so I'm a little sleepy

72
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:35,410
Kieran welcome to membership there and go um you what I did
the podcast.

73
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,170
Oh, hey, y'all.

74
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:46,930
And, um, no, I don't want to do a short stream because I
want to get through this.

75
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,750
I've been having fun playing it.

76
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,510
but, uh, and then before that, this morning, I had a
meeting.

77
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,160
So, it's been a busy day for me.

78
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,900
I've just been, I've just been in my, I'm on my computer the
whole time.

79
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,060
So...

80
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,360
Yeah.

81
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,160
But I'm excited to play Ghost Trick.

82
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,020
So, um, the reason I say all that is because if my voice...

83
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,900
If my... if my voice...

84
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,000
starts to get weird, it's because I've been talking all day.

85
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,300
Stampu Fueita.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,180
So!

87
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,840
New stampu Dekita.

88
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,220
Yeah.

89
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
What did you have a meeting about?

90
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,120
I can't say.

91
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,220
Oh my gosh.

92
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,780
And yesterday I went to the doctor's office.

93
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,640
And it was so sad.

94
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,280
I hate going to the...

95
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,440
Nothing bad happened.

96
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,120
I just hate going to the doctor's office.

97
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,440
So, yeah.

98
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,660
Let's...

99
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,260
Wow.

100
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:05,940
This doctor...

101
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,240
Thank you.

102
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,400
Wait, oh, hold on.

103
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,840
Did you see that Konami is bringing back the Metal Gear
Solid Ducks?

104
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,320
Specifically, Ocelot, Arrakon, and Psychomantis.

105
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,860
Have fun tricking ghosts.

106
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,680
Thanks!

107
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,380
I did see that they posted about it.

108
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,220
Wait, so there's no new Solid Snake?

109
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,980
I think I want the Ocelot Duck, but I think I'm okay with
the other ones.

110
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,880
I've been waiting for this milestone.

111
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,640
on chat since 2021.

112
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,580
Oh my gosh, thank you.

113
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,620
I only have solid snake.

114
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,040
I hope you are healthy.

115
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,020
I think I am.

116
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,620
What am I going to do?

117
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,560
Die again?

118
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:54,900
Yeah.

119
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,420
But, uh, how do you do the...

120
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
How do you do the...

121
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,080
The emote with the little...

122
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,320
With the...

123
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,300
With the wind.

124
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,480
I wanted to do it with the clown.

125
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,160
Looks like he was passing a little gas.

126
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,580
4 a.m.

127
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,080
can't sleep.

128
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,000
We're going to watch Pinto.

129
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,720
I hope that I can help you sleep a little bit more.

130
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,860
Oh, is it Dash?

131
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,880
Quack, sir.

132
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,300
Quack, sir.

133
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,900
Yeah, it's like the...

134
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,720
Fart unleashed.

135
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,080
Oh my gosh.

136
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,220
Stop it, you guys.

137
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:43,940
Stop it.

138
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,200
Okay.

139
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,260
So last time on Ghost Trick, we...

140
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,520
We found out that we are dead.

141
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,380
And we have special ghost powers where we can possess any
inanimate thing.

142
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,880
We're trying to figure out who killed us.

143
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:16,420
us we also have special powers where we can go back in time
and save people from becoming dead because we saved a dog

144
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:28,160
and a lady what you're dead i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead yeah
we saved missile the best dog ever we saved a lady we don't

Dad.

148
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,220
Let's continue.

149
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,220
What's on the extras?

150
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,800
I think this is like all the background.

151
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,120
Wait, challenges?

152
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,720

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,560
Cleared ghost trick.

75% of what?

155
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,820
I've already cleared 75% of something.

156
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,280
History of a secret.

157
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,080
Wait, maybe I...

158
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,780

161
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,460
And we have illustrations.

162
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,860
Oh, look at that!

163
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,000
This is such a good wallpaper for...

164
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,980
Oh, I can zoom in and out.

165
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,920
For my streams.

00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,020
Oh, the junkyard!

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,840
Tippy toes?

170
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,080
I don't remember his name.

171
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,580
There's a girl sick in this bed.

I read shot.

181
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,080
Somebody stuck it behind the bookcase at a haphazard angle.

182
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,960
Maybe that's the superintendent's way of tidying up.

183
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,160
Her shot.

184
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,760
Sorry.

185
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:58,880
Oh.

186
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,340
Oh, we can turn on the lamp.

187
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:02,580
Oh.

188
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,240
We're showing them the notebook.

189
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,180
There's also the book up here that we can't get up to yet.

190
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,640
Ew, what are these?

191
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,320
There's like a whole contraption down here.

192
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,860
Interesting, interesting.

193
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Oh, wait.

194
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,540
Oh, there we go.

195
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,320
She's probably still sleepy.

196
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:35,740
Matroshka.

197
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,640
Unconscious this time as well, eh?

198
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,480
That was the audio, by the way.

199
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:43,840
Oh!

200
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,640
She's awake!

201
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,020
Where am I?

202
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,980
Oh my gosh, she's awake!

203
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,500
She's awake!

204
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,520
She's coming, too?

205
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,660
You're gonna extract him, too?

206
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,440
What happened to me?

207
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,700
Audio's good?

208
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,480
Oh, God.

209
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,920
Excuse me.

210
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,400
ignoring me?

211
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,700
Oh, sorry.

212
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,280
I'm still not used to talking with dead people, you see.

213
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:15,380
Dead?

214
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,180
It's in red.

215
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
So I'm dead, huh?

216
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,680
Hmm.

217
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,700
Try as I might, I can't seem to remember who I am.

218
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,360
She's starting to remind me of me.

219
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,140
Who am I?

220
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,120
Everybody seems to call you Lynn, if that's any help.

221
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,300
Lynn, huh?

222
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:46,140
pretty cute name and apparently you're a detective too
detective you mean that super cool kind of cop that solves

223
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:57,940
crimes and upholds justice sounds like a pretty subjective
description but yes that kind of detective quote-unquote I

224
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:08,740
love that this game has two buttons ghost and trick um wait
a minute um I Actually, are you starting to remember

225
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,020
something?

226
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,680
Oh my god!

227
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,700
Mike Tyson's ass!

228
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,840
Thanks for the five, Katya!

229
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,840
Thank you!

230
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,500
We umi-neko now.

231
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,280
Oh.

232
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,960
Is my chair okay?

233
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,880
There's no time to lose!

234
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,230
Something really unusual is going down in this town tonight.

235
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,270
What?

236
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:36,930
What?

237
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,150
Ray Mack, thanks for the five, Katya!

238
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,230
Yeah, I certainly won't argue with the really unusual part.

239
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,510
His song is so fun.

240
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,310
That's not your face, you know.

241
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,370
Take another look.

242
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,870
You're the dead one.

243
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,710
Oh, right, of course.

244
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,350
It'd be pretty heinous if I looked like this, I guess,
wouldn't it?

245
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,250
I don't know if heinous is the right word.

246
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,270
Wow, the stuck things are the five gifted!

247
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,210
There we go!

248
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,550
She was just, she was actually stealing that guy's identity.

249
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,740
Something really unusual is going on in this town tonight.

250
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,740
Could I have anything to do with my death, I wonder.

251
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,830
This is my 7 a.m.

252
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,210
alarm.

253
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,590
You wake up to this?

254
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,850
Oh gosh, this is triggering for you then probably.

255
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,910
Identity theft is not a joke.

256
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,970
Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to.

257
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,190
I'm just going to put my...

258
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,730
Remember that guy that put his social security on, like, a
truck and drove it around New York?

259
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,050
And then said, no one will steal my identity.

260
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,770
It's protected by this company.

261
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,710
And then it all got stolen.

262
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,210
Don't ever tell people.

263
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,390
Don't ever challenge people, you know?

264
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,580
What is going on in this town tonight?

265
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,300
Don't ask me.

266
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,600
I'm dead.

267
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,920
I don't remember anything.

268
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,700
I can't remember her thing.

269
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,380
I think it's probably because I'm dead.

270
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,340
Everything is so confusing!

271
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,860
Can't you do something?

272
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,560
Oh, wait.

273
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,100
If he protects her or brings her back, will she be able to
remember who we are just like Missal, the dog?

274
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,120
Hey, you're asking the wrong guy.

275
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,180
Same for you, Mint.

276
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,720
What do you mean?

277
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,520
That I have no memories or don't challenge me?

278
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,720
But I've got some things to ask you about.

279
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,320
Oh.

280
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,880
She's not gonna remember me though.

281
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,740
What about her death?

282
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,320
So I died, huh?

283
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,060
Yes, apparently.

284
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,320
I'm very sorry.

285
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,840
How could this have happened?

286
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,740
And after I just passed my test, finally, this- wait, she
remembers!

287
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,980
My exciting career of catching the bad guys has just begun.

288
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,880
And now look at me!

289
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,060
Why did I have to go and die in an old junkyard like this?

290
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,820
Poor shock.

291
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,460
Oh, wait.

292
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,300
Poor shock.

293
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,260
Poor kid.

294
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,520
The shock is setting in.

295
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,480
Poor shock.

296
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:47,260
And so I told her everything that happened tonight about
ghost tricks, possessing, and manipulating objects, minutes

297
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,340
before a person's death.

298
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,860
Poor shock.

299
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,340
This actually isn't the first time you died tonight, you
know.

300
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,980
That's so freaky.

301
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,320
Oh my gosh, can you imagine?

302
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,820
You were already shot and killed once before tonight.

303
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,880
And you saved me?

304
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,280
That's right.

305
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,160
You don't remember?

306
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,240
Flashback.

307
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,400
Oh, death.

308
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:15,880
Slip.

309
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:16,700
Slip.

310
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,280
Let's get rid of the funky music.

311
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,820
Death isn't that funny, you guys.

312
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,680
Yes, I think I do remember something like that happening.

313
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,720
Vaguely.

314
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,460
Yes, I did get shot by a blue man dressed in all black.

315
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,380
How does she remember that?

316
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,180
I guess that means that even if a death is erased, the
memory of it remains.

317
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,560
Oh my gosh, you can remember how it hurt and everything?

318
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,800
The pain.

319
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,060
So I died twice already tonight.

320
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:49,760
Unlucky.

321
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,240
Is Mint literate?

322
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,780
Um.

323
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,760
Wish I knew what to say to her.

324
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,220
Guess I'll just have to wait until she recovers a little.

325
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,020
Hey, I bet that's some kind of a record, don't you think?

326
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,260
Yeah, you're probably right.

327
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,680
Looks like she's pretty much recovered already.

328
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,220
About me.

329
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,160
Do you remember anything about me?

330
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,940
I'm looking for the answers to the questions.

331
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,960
Who am I?

332
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,180
And, uh, why was I killed?

333
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,560
Do you know anything that might help me?

334
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,220
She can't read chat.

335
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,380
I'm sorry.

336
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,040
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,040
Sorry.

338
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,760
I'm also gonna be yawning tonight.

339
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,180
The only thing I know right now is that my name is Cicil.

340
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,280
Your name is Cicil, huh?

341
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,480
I think so.

342
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,120
It rings some kind of a bell anyway.

343
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,100
I think I was killed tonight while I was meeting with you.

344
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,120
at least know me, I think.

345
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,880
I was meeting with you?

346
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,420
Yes, in the junkyard outside.

347
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,020
I'm Eepy.

348
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,680
I have a...

349
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,520
Sorry, also.

350
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,780
I'm sorry if I'm so grumpy.

351
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,660
I don't think I'll be grumpy.

352
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:19,160
But I haven't been able to sleep much the past couple nights
because of the... What's the word?

353
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,940
The pinched nerve in my neck keeps me out.

354
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,820

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:52,720
two strangers so you don't know me huh nope wish i did so do
you suppose we're just two strangers who happened to me

363
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,700
tonight no way i don't think it was any accident Our lead,
man.

364
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,800
Why in the world would I be way out here in the middle of
nowhere for no reason?

365
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,160
I was asked to come here tonight.

366
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,300
Asked to come.

367
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,540
By who?

368
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,320
Your yawn is making me yawn.

369
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,180
I'm sorry.

370
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,920
If I have to get some coffee later, I will.

371
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,280
If I have to have to have...

372
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,280
I'm having tea right now, but if I have to have coffee,
that's okay too.

373
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,080
Can't you kind of guess where this is going?

374
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,940
We were set up.

375
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,680
Oh, you're kidding me?

376
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,260
Bingo.

377
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,120
By you.

378
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,240
Oh.

379
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,540
I asked you to come here?

380
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,100
But why?

381
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,500
Oh.

382
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,460
That's not what I was getting at.

383
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,260
Oh my god.

384
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,380
Good thing she's the detective.

385
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,200
That's why I was going to ask you.

386
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,920
Oh, that's what I was going to ask you.

387
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,400
Why did you ask me to come here tonight?

388
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,100
Way out here in the middle of nowhere.

389
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,620
Oh my god, a love confession.

390
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,400
You gotta be kidding me.

391
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,900
It goes without saying that I don't remember.

392
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,440
Everything is so confusing.

393
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,060
Can't you do something?

394
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,140
Lynn.

395
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,440
I'm not saying you owe me or anything.

396
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,820
But I have a favor to ask.

397
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,440
What is it?

398
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,860
In the next four minutes...

399
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,680
I didn't make a sound.

400
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,800
The next four minutes you'll probably come back to life.

401
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,720
When you do, do you think you could try to find...

402
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,320
Wait, do you think you could try to find out about me before
tomorrow morning?

403
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,240
Yeah, and I'm sleepy, who I am, and why I was killed.

404
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,520
Do you guys know a way to stop yawning?

405
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,500
Like, legitimately.

406
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,120
I used to have a job where I would wake up at, like, 4 a.m.

407
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:54,920
And I was teaching English, and I would, like, have to,
like, I would be on...

408
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Oh, I'm so sorry.

409
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,500
Anonymous, thanks for the vibe, gifted.

410
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,320
Thank you.

411
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:08,020
um i would like i don't think you can right i don't think so
i either almost dropped my controller but i i would be so

412
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:21,040
tired in the morning and then they would like they would
they would they would um they would say they would get on my

413
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,200
classroom and they would tell me to stop yawning or i would
like pause my screen so that they wouldn't see that was

414
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,920
yawning and they'd be like stop pausing your screen i was
like i'm yawning and they're like, no, it's, it's, it's

415
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,680
rude.

416
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,940
Don't yawn.

417
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,260
I was like, I'm sorry.

418
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,640
Take deeper breaths.

419
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,420
Won't that make you sleepy, though?

420
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,210
I know that they don't want me to yawn so that other people
won't yawn.

421
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,510
How am I supposed to stop myself to yawn?

422
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,040
Ah, man.

423
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,340
I still yawn.

424
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,500
I'm really sorry.

425
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,540
But I can't make it.

426
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,340
any promises.

427
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,940
Might as well tell you to stop sneezing.

428
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Right?

429
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,140
Why not?

430
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,280
They're the people I taught.

431
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,080
Okay.

432
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,280
Who knows?

433
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,580
Why not?

434
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,660
I don't remember very clearly right now.

435
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,120
But I think I was investigating a case tonight.

436
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,780
A case that is very, very important to me.

437
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,300
So even if I come back to life, I don't think I'll have time
to find out anything about you.

438
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,160
You

439
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,240
I know that's a terrible thing to say to the person who
saved my life once already.

440
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,520
Apparently cold drinks and cold snacks.

441
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,320
I have a warm drink.

442
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:45,780
Uh-oh.

443
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,080
I'm messing it up.

444
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,020
I'm really, really sorry.

445
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,640
Let's see.

446
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,200
That's too bad.

447
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,280
But I'm afraid I'm still going to ask you.

448
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,920
Ask me what?

449
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,160
Ask you to save me.

450
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,400
Even though I probably won't be able to help you.

451
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,720
I know it's selfish of me.

452
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,640
I really apologize.

453
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,100
But I just can't die.

454
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,480
Not yet.

455
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,140
Not like this.

456
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,140
It's alright, Mint.

457
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,100
Don't worry about it.

458
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,500
I'm investigating something important tonight.

459
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,540
I think maybe that might be the reason I was killed.

460
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,340
But I still want to solve that case in spite of all of that.

461
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,380
Am I out of line?

462
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,980
Didn't I tell you a minute ago?

463
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,070
you don't owe me.

464
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,480
I'm certainly not gonna treat your life like some kind of
bargaining chip.

465
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,700
I'll save you.

466
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,600
What you do after that is up to you.

467
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,660
He's so awesome.

468
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,820
He's so cool.

469
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,760
Shesso!

470
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,500
You ready to go back?

471
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,040
Back to four minutes before you got shot?

472
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,160
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

473
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,200
Yeah, rewind time!

474
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Okay, four minutes before death.

475
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,020
We gotta see what's going on.

476
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,600
Okay.

477
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,920
Lynn's second death.

478
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,760
I'm heading back in time now to rewind, rewrite her fight.

479
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,900
Faced with those circumstances, she could have just lied and
promised to help me.

480
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,020
But she didn't.

481
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,440
That's when I knew I could trust her.

482
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,820
So much sleepy.

483
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,820
I'm going to, after this I'm going to get, I'm going to get
coffee.

484
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,340
Don't worry.

485
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,680
Okay, here we go.

486
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,380
We're watching her.

487
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,240
She's on the phone.

488
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,260
I have a bad feeling about this.

489
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:48,960
Yes!

490
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,260
Oh!

491
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,280
Is this the guy that shot her?

492
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:55,900
Detective!

493
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,140
Is everything okay?

494
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,080
Oh!

495
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,360
Oh!

496
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:00,760
Oh!

497
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,140
I was hungry!

498
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,260
So I was trying to get something delivered.

499
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,360
What?

500
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,340
Don't do that?

501
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,400
Oh, I'm...

502
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,380
I'm sorry.

503
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,380
You should leave jobs like that to me.

504
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,500
Is chicken all right?

505
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,940
He's so cute.

506
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,760
One chicken dinner.

507
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,480
Winner, winner.

508
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,680
What a nice guy.

509
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,660
Oh, that's okay.

510
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,600
I'm not feeling very hungry anymore.

511
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,280
Where was he gonna order from?

512
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:48,700
I would like to go back to the station for a minute though

Chicken dinner, chicken dinner, chicken dinner, chicken
dinner.

It might be mobile only.

00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:37,880
I think so.

525
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,420
Did someone say chicken?

526
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,460
Why can't you let me go back to the station?

527
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,920
Inspector Cabanela is on his way.

528
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,080
He'll be here any minute.

529
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,760
Oh, there he is.

530
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,380

Wait, I am doing an Elvis voice.

539
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:48,950
Is it not?

540
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,550
Or is it not a good Elvis voice?

541
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,810
You hear it?

542
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,750
Six out of ten?

543
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,890
It's either Elvis or Johnny, bro.

544
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:08,050
I thought this special um, oh, oh, oh, daft elf.

545
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,170
Thank you for the five-gifted.

546
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:09,790
Thank you so much.

547
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:17,650
I thought this investigation unit had an important
top-secret assignment tonight what does that matter at a

548
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:39,860
time like this when my Lin's in crisis my Lin my Lin's in
crisis I appreciate it sir who are you you my in oh yeah

549
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,980
wait a minute did you Did you just say crisis?

550
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,480
Don't tell me I'm being suspected?

551
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,360
Uh-oh.

552
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,080
Suspected of shooting that pointy-haired man in the red
suit?

553
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,940
I mean, I've never even met the guy before!

554
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,060
Oh.

555
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,580
Hmm.

556
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,940
Never, baby.

557
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,060
Oh, well, uh...

558
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,620
Uh-oh.

559
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,740
Before tonight, I mean, he asked me to meet him here.

560
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,120
Hmm...

561
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,900
He said he had important information about the big case I'm
working on.

562
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,380
He's the one who contacted me!

563
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,580
I see, I see.

564
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,200
But it's funny, isn't it?

565
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,480
I took a look at the list of cases your station is handling
right now.

566
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,020
And I didn't see you listed as involved on any big cases.

567
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,700
We're rogue!

568
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,860
She's rogue!

569
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,320
You can't stop me, Dad.

570
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,760
You're not my dad.

571
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,300
You might be my dad.

572
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,860
But my dad wouldn't call me baby.

573
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,380
You know I don't suspect you, baby.

574
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,390
I'm just trying to clear things up.

575
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:51,900
Hubba, hubba.

576
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,020
Wait, what does Elvis say?

577
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,120
Humana, humana.

578
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:55,980
Wait, what?

579
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:57,900
Who, yeah.

580
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,300
Wait, what is...

581
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,140
It just says baby.

582
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,060
Hubba, hubba.

583
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,960
Oh, hubba.

584
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,540
Thank you.

585
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,200
Thank you very much.

586
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

587
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,000
You're not the type to ever shoot anybody.

588
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,280
Hey, who knows you're better than me, baby?

589
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:25,220
You know, if anything ever happened to you, I'd kill
everyone in this room and then myself.

590
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,680
I'd never be able to look him in the eye again.

591
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,200
My dad?

592
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,720
Inspector Cabanella, I'm going to ask you a question.

593
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:42,880
Yeah?

594
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,980
And what's that?

595
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh my god, she's gonna get shot before she can ask.

596
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,080
And I want you to answer honestly.

597
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:49,840
Don't delay.

598
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,240
You're about to get hit.

599
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,560
Is it tonight?

600
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,020
Oh, is that when it's happening?

601
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,820
Honka, honka!

602
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,380
I have no idea what you're talking about, baby.

603
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,720
Get down!

604
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,760
Oh!

605
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,540
That's that.

606
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,980
It seems to me that baby is indeed under suspicion.

607
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,400
By Inspector Cabanella?

608
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,920
No, he's not like that.

609
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,140
Just for the record.

610
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,840
Did you shoot me?

611
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,060
Me?

612
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,200
I would never do anything like that.

613
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,420
Anyway, it looks like the hitman fired from outside.

614
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,940
It'd be hard to prevent the bullet from coming in, though.

615
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,540
Hmm...

616
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,640
In any case, let's just give it a try.

617
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,400
Our four-minute game.

618
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,900
Our four-minute 12-hour game.

619
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:54,560
Hmm.

620
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,360
Trick time.

621
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,560
You know what?

622
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,560
I have an idea.

623
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,800
The guy who shot me is outside, right?

624
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,600
Looks that way, yeah?

625
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:11,620
Instead of trying to stop the bullet once it gets in here,
wouldn't it be more fun to go out and stop the guy who's

626
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,560
shooting the bullet?

627
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:21,560
like it fun she says with eyes gleaming oh boy you can use
the telephone to move around right that's right and i know

628
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:33,760
the telephone number to the junkyard payphone too but we're
upstairs and the shot i don't want to get shot again you

629
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,300
know what they say about three strikes and you're out as
long as you don't become a ball player you'll probably be

630
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:47,180
safe but the telephone thing's a good idea maybe I'll give
it a try what she's saying here I have a bad feeling about

631
00:35:47,180 --> 00:36:06,980
this yes I don't remember wait detective is everything okay
oh okay this is just to restart it my bad let me let me turn

632
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:25,080
ghost let me turn ghost turn ghost ghost trick oh ghost okay
let's see where can we go to the motor okay step ladder whoa

633
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:37,240
okay let's see what this is microscope photos what's in the
photos these pictures are old what are they of little

634
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:43,420
fragments of rock we're going ghost And the fragments are
glowing.

635
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,840
Do you know what these are?

636
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,220
It's, um, nuclear.

637
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,000
Radioactive.

638
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,120
Radioactive.

639
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,700
Sorry, but I've lost my memory.

640
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,220
Probably not the best person to ask.

641
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,220
That's okay.

642
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,480
I was only being polite.

643
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,920
I didn't really think you'd know.

644
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:02,640
Ouch.

645
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,340
This lady's tongue can be sharp.

646
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,480
I can hear what you're...

647
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,860
She can hear what we're thinking?

648
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,720
I know.

649
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,300
Good one.

650
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,680
No way!

651
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,520
She can hear what we're thinking?

652
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:24,070
No!

653
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:25,930
That's so scary.

654
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,290
What could this be?

655
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,730
It looks like a giant nail clipper.

656
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,370
You think so?

657
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,370
Do you know what it is?

658
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,030
Why did you have to ask me?

659
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,010
Couldn't you see I was looking away evasively?

660
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,390
It's one of those sciencey things that scientists use.

661
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,450
Ordinary people like us don't have to know what it is.

662
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,470
You're a detective, you need to know everything!

663
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,270
I don't remember what science is.

664
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,270
Mom, where does science come from?

665
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,290
But it's apparently something Lynn doesn't like very much.

666
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,350
She doesn't like or doesn't know.

667
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:11,690
Wee!

668
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,670
Okay, uh...

669
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,310
Do we know what's in the notebook?

670
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,450
because this seems kind of important.

671
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,050
Oh, wait.

672
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,250
Oh, that's mine.

673
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,050
Isn't it adorable?

674
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:25,870
Yee-yee-ye.

675
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,750
Cicel skipped first grade.

676
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,630
Why isn't your adorable notebook in your pocket?

677
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,650
I panicked, okay?

678
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,530
Don't you shove things in the bookcase when you panic?

679
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,850
Who are you calling anyway?

680
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,090
It was personal business.

681
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,270
I don't like the sound of that, Missy.

682
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,540
Oh, we still can't go with that.

683
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,940
threw anything down here.

684
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,760
Oh, I was gonna say, can I even get to the telephone?

685
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,020
Alright, let's try dialing it.

686
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,380
Micmac!

687
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,340
Thanks for the five gifted.

688
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:04,860
Thank you!

689
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,400
Oh, that's funny.

690
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,080
What's the matter?

691
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,500
This telephone doesn't seem to be working right now.

692
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,540
Usually the telephone line glows red, but it's dark right
now.

693
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,460
Oh, isn't it in the four minutes we can't use it?

694
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,580
Apparently.

695
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,060
Yeah, in this four minutes before death, we can't use the
phone lines.

696
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,860
Yes, yes, yes.

697
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,580
I remember now.

698
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,340
As long as the lines are closed like this, it looks like we
can't go anywhere.

699
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,820
But I want to stop that criminal!

700
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:31,940
Hmm.

701
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,260
Where else can we go?

702
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,640
Notebook.

703
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,290
There's a lot of stuff going on down here.

704
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:46,630
Oh, yeah.

705
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,490
I'm a little bald.

706
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,250
Can I move?

707
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:49,810
No.

708
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,880
We can't get that book either, still.

709
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:14,140
what do you mean let's see if if i swivel it if he does
anything this guy is unfazed he's like i've seen worse uh i

710
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:24,080
know this ain't my first poltergeist i don't have anything
else over here really so there's not really a reason to go

711
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:32,760
over here oh wait i said i did it earlier though i wanted to
turn the lamp on so that they would look at the notebook.

712
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:36,780
Huh?

713
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,740
That's Lynn's notebook.

714
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:39,960
Hey, wait a minute.

715
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,640
I did this earlier.

716
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,280
La la la la la la.

717
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,100
I thought she was practicing a dance move when I came.

718
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,240
Nope.

719
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,640
That was definitely suspicious.

720
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:56,660
No question.

721
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,540
I'd better report this.

722
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,280
I wonder if I can make the call without her noticing.

723
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,500
you little snitch you little snitch huh what's

724
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:25,770
up I've been watching Lynn just like you told me to and I
noticed something suspicious sus when the notebook is sus oh

725
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:41,050
you did some of that Spector Cabanilla was right.

726
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,050
She was hiding her notebook when I came in.

727
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,350
Her notebook, eh?

728
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,870
Yes, yes, sir.

729
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,190
In a very suspicious manner.

730
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,970
And in a very conspicuous place.

731
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,390
Just throwing all the memes out there.

732
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:02,470
Okay, but when you think of Among Us, do you not think of
Five Nights at Freddy's, too?

733
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,830
Anything else?

734
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:07,570
Let's see.

735
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,390
It's pink.

736
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,790
And it's a notebook!

737
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,430
You don't?

738
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,450
Anything else?

739
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,670
Um, let's see.

740
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,090
Come to think of it.

741
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:20,050
She was using the phone when I came in too.

742
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,890
And referring to her notebook!

743
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,410
Why would I?

744
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,170
I don't know.

745
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,490
What's the connection?

746
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,990
Um, beloved by children.

747
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,590
Okay, someone will be over later.

748
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,490
Don't let on you noticed anything.

749
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,050
Okay.

750
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:43,110
Look at that!

751
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,970
The phone line is glowing red!

752
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,550
I bet it would work if we tried it now.

753
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,730
I bet you're right.

754
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,830
The detective he's talking to is outside in the junkyard.

755
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:58,290
I mean, FNAF also has vents.

756
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,670
So true!

757
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,490
So true.

758
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,460
And that's where the horrible hitman who's after me is too.

759
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,460
I guess so.

760
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,700
Go to there.

761
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,100
Okay.

762
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,480
The most, the most ominous lamp I've ever...

763
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:38,860
What?

764
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,480
The Notebook starring acclaimed actor Ryan Gosling?

765
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,820
He's not in that.

766
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,460
Is he?

767
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,100
Is he?

768
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,880
I've been waiting for you.

769
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:54,960
Yeek!

770
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,120
What are you?

771
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,020
A test clamp.

772
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,700
That sounds like an... Oh, like an old grandpa.

773
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,540
Sounds like an old grandpa.

774
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,800
Just call me Ray.

775
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,860
Grandpa Ray.

776
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,580
You just have to get the grandpa part in there somewhere,
don't you?

777
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,540
Well, we didn't have that context before.

778
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,440
Interesting.

779
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,320
We're souls.

780
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,200
We can choose any appearance we like.

781
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,220
Which means you have no intention of showing us what you
really look like, right?

782
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,880
Now then.

783
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,980
About that gunshot that took you alive.

784
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,960
So Mint could also turn into a lamp?

785
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,000
I mean, I guess if I wanted to...

786
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,980
Do you want me to turn into a lamp?

787
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,260
Do you want me to turn into like anamorphs into a lamp?

788
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,720
The notebook with Ryan Gosling.

789
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:10,440
No, it's not I'm looking this up if it's the really Ryan
Gosling in the notebook I'll eat my shoe

790
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:24,370
No, it's not Ryan

791
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:37,410
Gosling.

792
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:38,950
Oh my god

793
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,270
No way!

794
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,610
Wait, who is Nicholas Sparks then?

795
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:50,250
Who is, wait.

796
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,950
That shoe tastes good.

797
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,970
Don't use the cloud emoji.

798
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:02,690
No way!

799
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,350
The author of the book the movie is based on...

800
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,140
No, no way.

801
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,560
I thought you guys were kidding.

802
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,480
I thought you were kidding because of the Ryan Gosling meme.

803
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,980
But he doesn't have a beard.

804
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,540
Time for lunch.

805
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,420
Okay, I'll eat it.

806
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,360
I'll eat it at the end of stream, okay?

807
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,180
Let me get through the stream first.

808
00:46:46,580 --> 00:47:01,620
I heard I hear shoes taste just like tree frogs Stop the
clown emoji I heard it Way up on the upper level A scant few

809
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:14,280
minutes from now The hitman is probably getting his rifle
ready Right now Alright I'm going in I'll get in with those

810
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:25,020
ghosties trick thingies I'm very sorry young lady but how
does it taste no that's okay meant surely right surely Ryan

811
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,540
Gosling isn't his real name

812
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:43,840
you don't have those powers no sir what why not I'm afraid I
don't know the reason but only a special few have the powers

813
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:53,140
of the dead what are you saying i'm not special that's not
fair i got a trophy for participating in the game when i was

814
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,840
a kid i'm special anyway we don't have much time

815
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:14,650
come on and hop in oh he's greeting us to enter his body
there he goes he's gonna go upstairs carry on boys

816
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:18,930
Fate changed.

817
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:20,810
Um.

818
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,280
Okay.

819
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,320
We're going crazy.

820
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,620
Uh.

821
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,120
If I fold this here.

822
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,940
Can we go up?

823
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:37,740
Oh.

824
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:38,700
Oh.

825
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:39,200
Oh.

826
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:39,320
Nice.

827
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:39,620
Nice.

828
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,880
Oh, it's this part again.

829
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:44,960
Refrigerator.

830
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,800
Oh.

831
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,640
There's nothing.

832
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,900
Nothing near.

833
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,320
Your shoes are chocolate, though, right?

834
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,360
Yeah.

835
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,420
Thought bubble above.

836
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:56,940
It's okay.

837
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:57,900
I don't want...

838
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,140
I don't want the hints.

839
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,760
I don't want the hints.

840
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,400
Oh, there he goes!

841
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,680
Oh my gosh, he's on the stairs!

842
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:06,840
It's so crazy.

843
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,620
But we gotta hop inside the lamp.

844
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,980
Ray.

845
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:13,820
Trick.

846
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:14,420
Trick.

847
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:14,860
Oh.

848
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,140
What do you mean by hop in, then?

849
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,680
What do you mean by that?

850
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,340
Let's see, what other things can we perform tricks on?

851
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,560
We can ghost trick me.

852
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,910
Maybe we do this part again.

853
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,640
Oh, time is passing!

854
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,020
Oh, wait.

855
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,360
This needs to be on, right?

856
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,540
Oh my god.

857
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,500
Oh, that was close.

858
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,060
Ha ha!

859
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,440
Why are you taking the bike?

860
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,540
No, no, no!

861
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,080
Okay, we saw him take the bike.

862
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,060
There he goes.

863
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,820
We should get going ourselves.

864
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,740
It feels like we lost, you know?

865
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,240
If there's one thing I hate, it's losing a race.

866
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,020
I wasn't aware we were in a race with the inspector.

867
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,340
Think barber pulls stripes.

868
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,880
You're red and he is white.

869
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,240
And it's a race to the top.

870
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,790
indulge her and try again.

871
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,660
Yeah, let's try this again.

872
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:46,590
Oh, I cleared... I cleared a song?

873
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:48,830
Wait, what's going on?

874
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:54,630
Okay.

875
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:59,050
Okay, there we go.

876
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:04,100
Turn...

877
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:04,970
On.

878
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:11,030
There's nothing else we could do here.

879
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:16,650
Maybe we were supposed to turn it on or turn it off when he
was up here.

880
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:23,630
Fun's for a good barbecue sauce to go with the leathery
taste of...

881
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:25,910
Thanks.

882
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:29,530
Yeah, I think we missed the bike.

883
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,560
Oh, but we see who's the guy.

884
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,600
Oh my gosh.

885
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,420
We see the guy, though.

886
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,180
Look, there he is, way up there.

887
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,660
The horrible hitman.

888
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,760
I think his name is actually Tengu, but I guess that doesn't
matter.

889
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,760
Let's go grind him to pieces.

890
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,040
I wish he wouldn't use such violent expressions.

891
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,140
Besides, I don't see any cores that will get us over there.

892
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,360
I think we might have missed our chance already.

893
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,820
Timing is everything.

894
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,360
Okay, sir.

895
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:03,160
Uh.

896
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:03,940
Oh.

897
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:05,820
Um.

898
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,600
Okay, let's do it after the fate change.

899
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:11,980
Okay.

900
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,120
He's always one step ahead.

901
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:14,780
I know!

902
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:16,460
That's okay.

903
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,420
We don't need to...

904
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,960
We know that she's gonna die.

905
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,920
We know how to get up there.

906
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,240
And foe!

907
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,700
Squared word, tortellini!

908
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,520
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

909
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,400
Thank you!

910
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,340
Alright.

911
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,860
I know I'm just gonna...

912
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:38,220
What is this?

913
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,060
What did they say anyway?

914
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,000
That horrible hitman that's after me is upstairs, isn't he?

915
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,080
Apparently.

916
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,720
In other words, we can't stop him if we stay down here.

917
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:46,060
See?

918
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,280
I didn't need the hint, you guys.

919
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,060
I was going... I was already on my way up there.

920
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,900
I was already on my way up there.

921
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,100
Now we wait.

922
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,080
It's time to hunt down that horrible hitman.

923
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,240
He must be around here somewhere preparing to take his shot.

924
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,260
One step ahead, Minto.

925
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,840
Let's try to find him fast.

926
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:22,760
I'm going to make...

927
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:28,140
I'm going to make good and sure he understands what happens
to people who point guns at others.

928
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:29,760
There's a gleam.

929
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,840
So, what if maybe...

930
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,160
The spotlight highlights him, maybe?

931
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,690
This is what we might have to do.

932
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,150
Time is passing.

933
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,210
He might, like, kick it if he gets so...

934
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:52,970
scared.

935
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,760
Uh...

936
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,060
What did I do wrong?

937
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,020
Okay.

938
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,080
I'm going ghost!

939
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,420
What did I do wrong?

940
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,940
There's nothing else we can do.

941
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,160
What if I roll the tire?

942
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,280
Might have been a dumb idea.

943
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,780
Okay, yeah, there's nothing over here.

944
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:06,360
Okay.

945
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,520
Can you jump to his bike?

946
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:10,380
Oh!

947
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,410
What are you talking?

948
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:14,930
Oh my gosh.

949
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:16,010
He's dancing his way.

950
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:16,910
Oh my gosh.

951
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:18,730
Go, go, go!

952
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,040
I thought that I was going to startle him with the light.

953
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,320
You guys...

954
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:33,880
It's...

955
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,140
I just...

956
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,620
Oh yeah, because I see now the bike.

957
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,400
it's lit up.

958
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,440
Guys, I had a good idea, okay?

959
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:43,560
Okay.

960
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,360
Here he comes.

961
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:44,940
Here he comes.

962
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:45,420
Ah!

963
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:48,620
Close.

964
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,400
Nice.

965
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,520
I'm going ghost.

966
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,440
There he is.

967
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,600
Spotlight him.

968
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,520
Spotlight him!

969
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,300
I see my target.

970
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:08,620
Time to go to work.

971
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,660
I'll be head of the hitter.

972
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,680
Hitman division by next month now for sure.

973
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:16,760
There he is!

974
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,920
The horrible Hitman!

975
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,400
Oh, we said this before.

976
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,640
We have to stop him from shooting!

977
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:22,320
Fast!

978
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:26,830
Oh!

979
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:28,510
Uh, open!

980
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:29,570
Oh!

981
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,720
Time is passing!

982
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,340
Turn the spotlight on!

983
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:38,700
Yeah!

984
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:39,880
Bozo!

985
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,320
We put a stop to that shot at least.

986
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:52,580
I'm so I'm safe now right well that changed your fate a
little but it didn't avert it completely we're not done yet

987
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:59,780
the hitman is a professional and he really really wants to
be head of the division apparently I get blinded Bozo this

988
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:06,820
guy this stupid guy behind us yeah I vouched for you I
vouched for you but you can't even notice a guy hitman

989
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:14,820
coming from behind the car I doubt blocking a shot here and
there is really gonna stop him we have to kill him we have

990
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:22,840
to splat him just like the last guy if you want to rough him
up a little bit i promise i won't put it in my report you

991
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:26,660
made that bet knowing well that ghosts don't wear shoes

992
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:46,450
what no no that was my oh she's so effigy stop it stop it
Stop it.

993
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:47,750
Stop it.

994
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:49,050
Come on.

995
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:50,670
Stop.

996
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:52,950
Stop it.

997
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,040
Okay.

998
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:02,540
I was gonna say something else, but I don't want to go to
the bathroom just yet.

999
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,520
Let's think of something else before he gets a shot in.

1000
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,420
Fate has been changed.

1001
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:16,100
We're gonna pedal to the metal with this guy.

1002
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,480
Pedal, pedal, pedal.

1003
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:25,440
pedal oh we're stuck here just kidding we're gonna bicycle

1004
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,820
close the door

1005
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:43,700
oh come here come here come here night stick oh there we go
there we go there we go we got to get the next spotlight oh

1006
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,680
my gosh don't you notice

1007
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,080
Oh my god, this guy is so oblivious.

1008
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,320
Your hat is too low on your face.

1009
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,840
You can't see anything in front of you.

1010
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:04,350
If I want that position, I have to be careful of even the
least bit of light.

1011
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,230
Division head is my ambition for this year.

1012
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:13,610
Next year, my motto will be, If I want to be director, I
have to be careful of even the least bit of scandal.

1013
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:18,150
So it sounds like he won't show up in spots where a light is
on.

1014
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,290
I heard some nasty scandalous rumors about him.

1015
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:27,210
Wee-woo!

1016
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,090
Flashing light!

1017
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:31,450
Oh!

1018
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:32,770
What?

1019
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,110
Wait, they didn't see him.

1020
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:38,650
Hey, did you turn that flashing light on?

1021
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:40,590
Wasn't me.

1022
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:42,350
It went off all by itself.

1023
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:43,630
Scared the heck out of me.

1024
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,770
Well, just make sure you lay off it.

1025
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:48,430
Don't want to waste any electricity.

1026
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,470
Wow, they're so...

1027
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:50,490
They're so conscious.

1028
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:53,290
Have things gotten that tight?

1029
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:54,710
That's pretty sad.

1030
00:59:56,410 --> 01:00:00,330
They're really putting the squeeze on us lately about using
too much power at sites.

1031
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:04,950
They won't even let us use all of our search lights at once.

1032
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:07,030
Interesting.

1033
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:08,510
Oh boy.

1034
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:12,750
We ought to be free to do at least that much, especially on
a dark night like tonight.

1035
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:13,850
Uh oh.

1036
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,890
I think I need to follow this guy now.

1037
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:29,530
passing.

1038
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:31,970
Oh, maybe I was wrong.

1039
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:33,650
What?

1040
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:34,150
Oh!

1041
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:36,150
Oh my gosh.

1042
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:46,680
Budget cuts.

1043
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,160
What are you gonna do exactly?

1044
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,340
Hey, I told you.

1045
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:58,020
I think if we make it so we can't do the shot from here,
it'll at least keep the spotlight on the other location, you

1046
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:58,220
know?

1047
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:03,600
So he won't be able to go back to the other car, but he also
won't be able to get it here.

1048
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,240
That's what I think.

1049
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,620
I told you to lay off that thing.

1050
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,520
And I told you, it wasn't me.

1051
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:12,940
Uh-oh.

1052
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,840
I think I might know what's going on here.

1053
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,700
This is the work of...

1054
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,000
You know.

1055
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:22,060
What?

1056
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,340
Hey, shut up!

1057
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,900
You're creeping me out!

1058
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:30,880
But you know as well as I do the only explanation for
mischief like this is...

1059
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,040
I'm not gonna get caught here, am I?

1060
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,100
Oh, Inspector Cabanella!

1061
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,920
So they tell tales about him as though he's a ghost, eh?

1062
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,700
Spectre Cavanella is really a very nice person.

1063
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:47,980
Oh, ghost!

1064
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,120
Oh, jinkies!

1065
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,700
Wait, so if I just stay here...

1066
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,370
It doesn't feel like I'm doing so much.

1067
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,660
You're allegedly a ghost.

1068
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,700
What's the best trick?

1069
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,740
I don't know.

1070
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,860
What if I do this?

1071
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,360
Nothing happens.

1072
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:23,660
That's funny.

1073
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:27,000
I thought this lever was for swinging the crane arm around.

1074
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,220
I'd like to swing that horrible hitman around.

1075
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:32,940
This crane.

1076
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,380
I wonder if there's some other way we can use it.

1077
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:37,760
Oh, wait.

1078
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:38,840
My bad.

1079
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,160
Can we reach the light?

1080
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:43,800
We can.

1081
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,640
But if I do this...

1082
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:55,330
I would have to go back with the other guy to get back up to
the crane.

1083
01:02:58,210 --> 01:02:59,350
But then that one turns off.

1084
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:01,070
Okay, wait, I think I messed up.

1085
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:03,650
One of the lights went out.

1086
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,870
There are three lights here altogether.

1087
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:08,090
Apparently we can't have all three of them on at once.

1088
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:10,830
Our station is crazy cheap when it comes to electricity.

1089
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:15,190
So just another detective could see what he was doing the
other day.

1090
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,690
I had to pedal my bicycle in place to work the headlamp.

1091
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:19,150
Oh my god.

1092
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:19,830
Oh my god.

1093
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:21,450
Very sad tale indeed.

1094
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:23,750
Sounds like they're taking things way too far.

1095
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:27,970
So I'm going to turn this one off.

1096
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:31,790
I need to get...

1097
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:32,550
Wait, come back!

1098
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:33,050
Uh-oh.

1099
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:33,590
Uh-oh.

1100
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:35,050
Wait, come back, officer!

1101
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:36,510
Oh my gosh, please.

1102
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:36,950
Please.

1103
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:39,290
Sir.

1104
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:43,090
Time is passing!

1105
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:44,930
Oh my god, I hear him!

1106
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:45,410
I hear him!

1107
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:45,830
I hear him!

1108
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:46,250
I hear him!

1109
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,330
Oh my god, please!

1110
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,170
Oh my god!

1111
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:54,610
okay okay see

1112
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:17,790
the bike I couldn't pedal can I pedal this one no so let's
wait for our little guy here let's wait for our guy then

1113
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:28,750
we'll do it again at the other side then maybe try something
with the with the with the what the what the oh my Oh

1114
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:35,850
my gosh, why?

1115
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:37,630
Oh my gosh, why?

1116
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,850
Oh my god, I'm not gonna make it!

1117
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:44,290
No!

1118
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,590
Where is he gonna shoot her from?

1119
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:52,550
Uh, let's see.

1120
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:53,610
Rays here.

1121
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:56,330
Oh, neat.

1122
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:56,850
Okay.

1123
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:06,110
Oh shoot!

1124
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,000
Such power and such speed.

1125
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,920
I bet that would put a nice stop to my horrible hitman.

1126
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,140
Okay how do we move it?

1127
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,560
It just stopped and that would be fine.

1128
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:22,900
Phoenix thanks for the membership!

1129
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:24,840
Welcome welcome.

1130
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,720
If it killed him would I be obliged to save him?

1131
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:31,260
Anyway let's just focus on the stopping part.

1132
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,820
Apparently thinking about things too deeply isn't something
you like to do.

1133
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,180
Just the right amount.

1134
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,020
That's the way detectives think about things.

1135
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,320
How do I move this?

1136
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,360
Oh, I just love stamping out evil.

1137
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,120
It makes me feel so alive.

1138
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,840
Except for the fact that you're dead.

1139
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,300
Uh...

1140
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:54,860
The...

1141
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:55,320
Open.

1142
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:57,460
Whee!

1143
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:00,580
Oh!

1144
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,340
Oh, what?!

1145
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,100
Okay.

1146
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:09,600
Rema- Everybody, if I ask to open the umbrella, don't let me
do it.

1147
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,460
Wait, did we see this before?

1148
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,060
Wait, I think we can pretty safely assume this was the
murder weapon.

1149
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:23,500
Wait, I think we did.

1150
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:24,900
That pistol.

1151
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,680
Same model as the pistol you detected.

1152
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,720
Yeah, we saw this before.

1153
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:31,960
You don't think it's Lynn, do you?

1154
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,340
This is not good.

1155
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:34,880
We've read all this.

1156
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:37,280
we made it go off.

1157
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,280
That's all right.

1158
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,220
It's a good recap.

1159
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:46,380
This is the act of somebody who's jealous of my abilities as
a detective.

1160
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:47,580
Sorry if I'm not reading all of it.

1161
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,260
I'm just gonna...

1162
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:51,990
Oh.

1163
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:54,090
There it is.

1164
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:56,610
Her death.

1165
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:59,430
Time's up.

1166
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:00,930
Okay.

1167
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,270
Have to look for the right time.

1168
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:06,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1169
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:10,670
Oh no, we have to go all the way from...

1170
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:11,910
Oh my gosh.

1171
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,630
That's a long amount of time we have to...

1172
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:16,290
Oh wait!

1173
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:17,790
Oh okay, interesting.

1174
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:22,650
We can't do anything with the pedal.

1175
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:25,170
We only pedaled to get down here.

1176
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:27,190
How do I get up there?

1177
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:33,390
Also see, I think the street lamp can be possessed.

1178
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:36,050
Hmm.

1179
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:38,330
Oh, look, my bad.

1180
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:42,210
Mr. Come back, please.

1181
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:46,370
Thank you, sir.

1182
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:47,590
What else can...

1183
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:49,350
Yeah, the lamp can also be.

1184
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:02,330
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

1185
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,080
But the lever didn't do anything.

1186
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:22,890
Follow this guy.

1187
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:30,250
I wonder if we do anything on the...

1188
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,450
The guitar is still all...

1189
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:33,370
Filled with bullet holes, that's so funny.

1190
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:38,600
Raise!

1191
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:42,420
Okay.

1192
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:50,020
And if I lowered it, it didn't really do anything.

1193
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:52,260
No.

1194
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:58,290
I'm just confused how to get over there.

1195
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:00,110
Oh no!

1196
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:00,690
Oh no!

1197
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:01,790
Oh no!

1198
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:01,930
Oh no!

1199
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:03,410
Wait, I can make it, I can make it!

1200
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:04,510
Oh I can't make it!

1201
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:04,950
I can't!

1202
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:06,110
I can't make it!

1203
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:07,610
Oh no, he's gonna shoot her!

1204
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:08,990
Oh no, please!

1205
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:09,710
Don't shoot!

1206
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:13,250
Come back, sir!

1207
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:16,030
Oh my god, he's loading his gun.

1208
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:37,210
This one!

1209
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:38,830
We need him to show up at this one!

1210
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:40,390
Wait, but this one...

1211
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:42,230
Okay.

1212
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:46,750
Uh...

1213
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:51,490
Oh, wait.

1214
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,090
Which one did it turn?

1215
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:54,750
Oh, no, yeah, because we already turned it off.

1216
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,610
Okay, now come back, please!

1217
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:00,410
Sir?

1218
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:01,470
Sir?

1219
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,990
So, please come back.

1220
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:05,670
Thank you.

1221
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:09,370
Okay, good thing we turned off that spotlight right there
first.

1222
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:12,710
And then...

1223
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,790
Oh, that's where you show up, eh?

1224
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:16,830
Big dummy.

1225
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:20,250
This is quite a distance from the target.

1226
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,630
But I can't work under a spotlight after all.

1227
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:23,370
Never mind.

1228
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:25,770
A shot like this is nothing for a man of my skill.

1229
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,730
I mean, you're a sniper.

1230
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,870
That's what you're supposed to do, distance.

1231
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:34,150
Mr. Division Head seems to like dark, gloomy places.

1232
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:37,390
I'd be happy to throw him in a dark, gloomy cell.

1233
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:39,890
Or into dark, gloomy hell.

1234
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:41,630
Ah, ha, ha, ha.

1235
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:44,130
Oh, when did I become her assistant?

1236
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:45,930
Wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1237
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:46,750
No!

1238
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:52,370
What?

1239
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:53,530
Whoa, they talked?

1240
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:55,810
No way!

1241
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:56,530
Okay.

1242
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:58,690
Time is passing.

1243
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:00,170
Okay.

1244
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:03,740
Just a little bit more.

1245
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:04,500
There we go.

1246
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:05,700
Okay.

1247
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:10,660
I'm going, ghost!

1248
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,360
It's over for you, mister.

1249
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,940
Oh, my god.

1250
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:25,480
Oh, did you hear a scream just now?

1251
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,280
I'm telling you, it wasn't me.

1252
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:33,440
Oh, my gosh, I killed two people tonight.

1253
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:34,940
Dang.

1254
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:41,590
I've killed two people just to save one girl.

1255
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:43,790
And a dog.

1256
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:44,910
I mean, the dog was worth it.

1257
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,210
But what if the girl is evil?

1258
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:49,610
There.

1259
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:55,330
We found a nice dark spot for our gloom-loving hitman.

1260
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:58,010
I think your death has been erased.

1261
01:11:58,590 --> 01:11:59,010
Again.

1262
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:01,710
Fate averted!

1263
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:04,310
Does Lynn seem evil?

1264
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:06,750
Maybe.

1265
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:12,270
I don't know, I can't, I don't know if I can trust her spiky
hair.

1266
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:15,290
Why not, I wonder?

1267
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:16,430
Huh?

1268
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:19,070
Why don't I have powers like yours?

1269
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:25,910
If I could do things like you do, it could really help me
pursue my case.

1270
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,730
Why only this special few, huh?

1271
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:30,950
It's not fair.

1272
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:34,410
That's the same thing the little doggy said, too.

1273
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:46,090
because yeah you get to stay alive you are why because your
life can be saved even if you die again tonight I can save

1274
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:58,370
you with my ghost tricks nobody can save my life though oh
yeah I'm dead lady you should appreciate your life I'm dead

1275
01:12:58,370 --> 01:13:08,090
this powers of the dead why have they chosen me will I find
the answer to that question tonight I bet we Well, not in

1276
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,750
tonight's stream, maybe, but I don't know.

1277
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:12,190
Cicel, I'm so sorry.

1278
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:14,870
Well, you're free to do as you please now.

1279
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:17,290
I guess this is goodbye, detective.

1280
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:19,790
Will we ever see each other again?

1281
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:24,070
If you ever want to see me again, all you have to do is die.

1282
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:27,130
Okay, got it.

1283
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:28,330
I was kidding.

1284
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:32,330
Well, guess we'd better be getting back to the present.

1285
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:37,070
Kikikik.

1286
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:39,130
Kakui.

1287
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:43,430
Is that really kakui to say die for me?

1288
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:49,470
Lin is cute so she's worth saving.

1289
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:53,990
Lin has escaped death for a second time.

1290
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:56,890
But that doesn't mean she's out of the water yet.

1291
01:13:58,490 --> 01:13:59,810
I'd better go see how she's doing.

1292
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:00,850
Can you imagine?

1293
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:01,790
What if you just like...

1294
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:06,210
What if you do the four minutes before death over and over
and over and over again?

1295
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:15,210
and like no matter how many tries you did there was never a
way to save them what if you're put in a situation where

1296
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:31,030
they have to die you know that's kind of dark but like
that's just Steinsgate that's called Steinsgate but in but

1297
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:38,930
in this game my gosh I love Steinsgate I better go see how
she's doing.

1298
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:41,810
I'm going ghost!

1299
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:45,750
Meow.

1300
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:49,650
Oh, whose bag is this?

1301
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,290
Mr. Officer, are you coming back?

1302
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,350
Oh, wait, who's gonna...

1303
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:57,370
How am I gonna get over there?

1304
01:14:58,750 --> 01:14:59,970
Check on how she's doing.

1305
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:00,570
Oh, wait!

1306
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:02,530
I can check with the umbrella.

1307
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:04,230
That's why the umbrella's there.

1308
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:08,130
Through the phone.

1309
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:11,410
Yeah, I already thought of it before you.

1310
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:14,530
Wee!

1311
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:17,730
Was that light on before?

1312
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,320
Uh, wait.

1313
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:23,500
Here.

1314
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:24,520
There.

1315
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:26,620
Oh, this way.

1316
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:34,620
Well, it looks like congratulations are in order.

1317
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:35,160
Oh, sorry.

1318
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:38,660
It looks like congratulations are in order.

1319
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:41,320
erased yet another death.

1320
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,660
Oh, aren't we so clever?

1321
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:46,940
I know.

1322
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,520
I know.

1323
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:55,860
But I haven't gotten any further in solving my own mystery,
though.

1324
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,500
But that woman holds the key.

1325
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,060
Don't forget that.

1326
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:01,580
Lynn, huh?

1327
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:08,260
Now that she's alive again, she's probably still being
detained in the super super's office.

1328
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:12,200
She won't be able to pursue her case without the freedom to
move around.

1329
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:15,280
I'd better go back to the super's office to see her.

1330
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,620
That sounds like a good idea.

1331
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:21,180
Beep-boop.

1332
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:25,480
The super's office.

1333
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,340
Actually, you guys, I'm going to go to the bathroom real
quick.

1334
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,720
I said I was going to go earlier, but now I actually have to
go.

1335
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,660
I have to go to the little ghosties room.

1336
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:34,600
Give me one minute.

1337
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:38,160
I'm also going to get some more tea or coffee.

1338
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:39,480
One or the other.

1339
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,420
I'll be right back.

1340
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:48,540
You can enjoy this sick soundtrack while I get more drink.

1341
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:49,560
Okay, hold on.

1342
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:40,940
Oh my god.

1343
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:46,400
While I was getting my coffee, a package that I was waiting
for came.

1344
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:46,980
Hold on.

1345
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:47,860
I'm going to get some scissors.

1346
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:13,420
I was waiting for this because I got stuff for my back.

1347
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:15,840
Ouch!

1348
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:17,100
I got

1349
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:23,870
it!

1350
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:26,930
This is the thing for me to try later.

1351
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:28,910
For my neck!

1352
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:30,830
I got two things for my neck.

1353
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:33,370
But this one I lay on.

1354
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:38,510
Oh, this one's heavy because it's cat food.

1355
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:39,730
Hold on.

1356
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:42,370
I got it!

1357
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:43,490
Um...

1358
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:45,610
Yeah, stuff for my spine!

1359
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:47,350
Can't be!

1360
01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:49,690
Oh, wait.

1361
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:51,230
Okay.

1362
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:53,330
Yippee!

1363
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:55,870
Yippee!

1364
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:57,830
Yippee!

1365
01:21:58,670 --> 01:21:59,970
Okay, cat food!

1366
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:03,810
Oh, thank goodness I was running out of cat food!

1367
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:06,350
Yeah!

1368
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:07,370
A

1369
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:12,570
lot of stuff!

1370
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:13,890
Oh.

1371
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:15,930
I'm good.

1372
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:17,270
Oh my god.

1373
01:22:17,610 --> 01:22:18,530
One bar support.

1374
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:21,350
I feel like such an old person.

1375
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:23,270
Oh!

1376
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:24,530
Okay, there we go.

1377
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:26,990
Um, I'm gonna open it.

1378
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:27,770
I'm gonna put it on.

1379
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:29,930
Wait, can I put it on right now?

1380
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:35,650
Will it be too difficult to put on?

1381
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:40,550
Also, I realized I didn't have any creamer either for my
coffee.

1382
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:45,250
So it's just coffee and milk.

1383
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:45,870
Oh gosh.

1384
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:49,710
Grandma mint.

1385
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:52,750
It's just because I have a...

1386
01:22:54,690 --> 01:22:57,130
I always get pinched nerves in my arms.

1387
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:17,440
and in my I have sciatica that's a pinch nerve in your in
your butt so this product

1388
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:39,490
can cause burns 55 or older your risk of burning increases
as you age do not wear while sleeping okay check Skin

1389
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:41,010
frequently during use.

1390
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:46,430
Do not use for more than eight hours.

1391
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:47,230
Okay.

1392
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:49,090
Actually that works perfect because...

1393
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:53,390
You will burn as you age.

1394
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:55,210
I'm in my 30s.

1395
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:59,590
I just bought an adjustable bed base for backpan.

1396
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:00,470
Embrace it.

1397
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:01,290
Let's go!

1398
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:04,730
Hey, there's nothing wrong with getting something for
comfort, you know?

1399
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:06,290
And Draco thanks for the 10 gifted!

1400
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,350
How do I put this on?

1401
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:14,150
Uh, heat cells.

1402
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:18,730
Guys, I'm gonna feel the deep penetrating relief.

1403
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:20,990
Wait, which way do I put it on?

1404
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:23,810
Oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.

1405
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:25,310
I think I get it.

1406
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:26,350
Okay, okay, okay.

1407
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:30,010
I'm gonna feel the deep penetrating relief that it says.

1408
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:35,710
Clinically proven to relax tight muscles and enhance
flexibility and mobility.

1409
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:38,630
Why do I sound like such an old person?

1410
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:41,710
Oh my gosh.

1411
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:43,070
You don't have to say it like that.

1412
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:47,810
Okay, I gotta put it on my neck.

1413
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,620
I don't feel anything yet.

1414
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,340
Hey, I'm so glad that this came.

1415
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,220
I need the relief.

1416
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:09,420
So much pain, you guys.

1417
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,340
Okay, I'm so sorry about that.

1418
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:13,760
All right.

1419
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,580
All right, we're good to go.

1420
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,300
Let's go to the super's office.

1421
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:21,540
The age of 3,000 isn't the man.

1422
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,380
Hag love.

1423
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:26,420
Deep penetrating relief.

1424
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:30,100
I decided to go back to the office where Lynn was being
detained.

1425
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,940
With her changed fate, her story was sure to change too.

1426
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:36,700
And maybe that would lead us in some new direction.

1427
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:39,140
Hags are love, hags are love.

1428
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,600
This is the hag life, you guys.

1429
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:51,140
Have a great summer and also have a healthy, have a
pain-free, summer with neck pain therapy deep penetrating

1430
01:25:51,140 --> 01:26:03,520
relief yeah now that Lynn is alive again I wonder what she's
doing she said she was investigating oh oh my god

1431
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:15,780
investigating an important case tonight but that case be
connected to me in any way ha haps ghost hag arc begins oh

1432
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,800
We cleared the challenge.

1433
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:22,300
I'm still so curious what's going on in that guy's basement,
though.

1434
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,520
Listen to the music.

1435
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:25,120
Yeah.

1436
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:28,900
Continue.

1437
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:37,360
If you sleep on your side like I do, I had the same symptoms
type muscles on the shoulder, neck with bonus tension

1438
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:37,840
headaches.

1439
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:39,920
I'll do it all by sleeping with a pillow between the knees.

1440
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,000
I can't, I try.

1441
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,180
I seriously cannot sleep with a pillow between my knees.

1442
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,320
It drives me insane.

1443
01:26:47,500 --> 01:27:01,220
too much in my sleep i think i had one before hag life is
either be warm forever or die also i can't um i i'm such a

1444
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:12,260
particular sleeper oh my gosh okay so i can't have so much
pressure on top of me so like when um when when i have a

1445
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:19,840
pillow in between my knees it makes it so that the sheets
are too tight and it feels like it's i'm not claustrophobic

1446
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:28,860
but only only only when i sleep do i feel claustrophobic
because if i can't move around at at will then i feel like

1447
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:41,460
i'm gonna die but but um daki macuras exist for a reason no
i can't use it that i only look at daki macura i don't know

1448
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:49,380
i'm so so particular but at the same time I have to sleep
with all of my arms and legs and everything underneath a big

1449
01:27:49,380 --> 01:28:05,130
heavy comforter which makes no sense considering considering
how did you sleep in Japan with their comforters I was fine

1450
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:17,130
it's so weird I love my comforter me too oh my gosh I felt
so seen the other because like you know how comforters and

1451
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:23,490
like when you see the pictures of them they're so billowy
and puffy and you're just like oh my gosh this looks like

1452
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:30,670
the fluffiest ever comforter ever and then when you get it
it's like flat and terrible and it feels like there's only

1453
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:38,870
five down feathers in it and you're like what happened I've
been I've been scammed but I found out that there's like a

1454
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:51,810
thing that you have to get to make them look fluffy I can't
remember what it's called though hood winked yeah hug your

1455
01:28:51,810 --> 01:29:07,530
snake dockey when you get it oh I am I am duvet cover it
might be that there was a different name too though anyway

1456
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:13,650
when Lynn lost her life for the second time she was being
detained on suspicion of my murder but I saved her hoping to

1457
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:19,410
solve my own mystery living creatures can choose to live
their lives in one of two ways.

1458
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:23,870
They can either submit to their fate or they can try to
change it.

1459
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:26,450
Lynn is definitely in the second camp.

1460
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:31,990
Well, I mean, she's only trying to change it because you
brought her back.

1461
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:33,970
It's you trying to change it.

1462
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:38,570
Just Google fluffing.

1463
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:39,730
Is that what it is?

1464
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:41,190
No, I don't think so.

1465
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:42,030
It's a different word.

1466
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:57,450
this fact was really brought home to me what is fluffing do
not Google that wait what is that fool you we told you not

1467
01:29:57,450 --> 01:29:59,390
to let the suspect out of what is fluffing

1468
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:18,210
not stream safe I'm googling it don't do it apparently no
Phil no don't look I'm not gonna look it up because I'm

1469
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:18,710
scared.

1470
01:30:19,130 --> 01:30:20,330
I'm actually, I have no idea.

1471
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:22,770
Preparation for a certain job.

1472
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:24,410
What?

1473
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:24,830
What?

1474
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:25,550
Fluffing.

1475
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:35,290
What kind of yabai job would have you prepare for something
that would be called fluffing?

1476
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:38,310
Does it have to do anything with being fluffy?

1477
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:43,430
Like, um...

1478
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:51,670
Like, you know, How some bigger people say I'm not fat and
fluffy?

1479
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:56,890
No, oh, okay.

1480
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:08,110
Certain video actors, A-B stuff, really?

1481
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:18,470
What's related to A-B?

1482
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:29,570
You fluff the relief, what does that mean?

1483
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:31,390
I'm confused.

1484
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:35,390
To keep you ready between shots.

1485
01:31:40,910 --> 01:31:42,290
I just don't understand.

1486
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:44,030
Okay, I'm just gonna believe you guys.

1487
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:48,030
I don't get it.

1488
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:51,770
Gotta raise this flag before you sit still.

1489
01:31:55,770 --> 01:31:56,670
Oh, wait.

1490
01:31:57,390 --> 01:32:01,130
I think I get it.

1491
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:07,760
Anyway...

1492
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:08,440
How do you know?

1493
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,160
How do you guys know that?

1494
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:14,280
We told you not to let the suspect out of your sight!

1495
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:15,940
My apologies, sir.

1496
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,520
But I never thought she would run away.

1497
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,580
Oh my god, she just ran!

1498
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:20,420
She booked it!

1499
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:21,560
Lynn is our angel.

1500
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,920
I mean, her friend.

1501
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,400
I mean, she's like family to us.

1502
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:28,640
Angel, friend, or family.

1503
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,720
They all run when they have the chance.

1504
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:32,920
Because we're perverts.

1505
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:36,960
It's okay, I like that about you guys.

1506
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:38,140
A little bit.

1507
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:43,160
Do you have any idea how many years it's been since my wife
ran away?

1508
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,500
Holy moly!

1509
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,400
Feeney, are you okay?

1510
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:49,760
I'm very sorry.

1511
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:50,940
I have no idea, sir.

1512
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,700
You'll never make a detective at that rate.

1513
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:56,860
Dang.

1514
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:58,380
Now find Lynn.

1515
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,020
Yes, yes, sir.

1516
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:03,220
God.

1517
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,960
gets word of this, it's all over.

1518
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:09,780
This poor guy.

1519
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,060
I can see why his wife left him.

1520
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:17,820
So our red-headed detective escaped, did she?

1521
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:20,240
But I just barely saved her a few minutes ago.

1522
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,260
Whew, she's fast.

1523
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:22,740
Wait, but where's the detective?

1524
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:23,600
Cabanella.

1525
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:25,980
I guess I'll look around for leads.

1526
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:28,500
Her notebook, obviously.

1527
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:30,800
Trick time!

1528
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:34,880
Don't touch that dial.

1529
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:36,500
Close.

1530
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:39,360
No, it's going to open eventually.

1531
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:42,100
Or...

1532
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:43,260
Oh, hold on.

1533
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,280
I want to get to that notebook up there.

1534
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:46,800
So we're going to...

1535
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:47,460
Oh, no, wait.

1536
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:48,220
Wrong thing.

1537
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:48,760
My bad.

1538
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:49,840
Here.

1539
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,280
If I turn this around...

1540
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,160
Will the steam somehow push it up?

1541
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:58,860
I don't know.

1542
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:02,680
Lynn's notebook.

1543
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:03,580
Sad and forgotten.

1544
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:04,820
Sits behind the bookshelves.

1545
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:08,740
Who could she have been calling on the phone before she hit
it there?

1546
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:10,240
Wish I could find out.

1547
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:16,550
Hmm.

1548
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:18,770
Try Square Pillow as a side sleeper for...

1549
01:34:18,770 --> 01:34:20,310
I've looked into Squared Pillow.

1550
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:22,570
Right now, I do have...

1551
01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:23,950
I do use a specific pillow.

1552
01:34:24,190 --> 01:34:26,150
I've always had back problems forever.

1553
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:27,350
Even as a ghost.

1554
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:29,710
Oh, everything is hard.

1555
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:36,190
What's our guy doing over here?

1556
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:37,190
Oh, there's more people!

1557
01:34:38,690 --> 01:34:39,750
I can't hear from here.

1558
01:34:39,870 --> 01:34:40,510
Better get closer.

1559
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:41,950
Oh, okay.

1560
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:44,330
Is she down here?

1561
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:51,130
What's he saying?

1562
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:54,330
That old pigeon man.

1563
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:56,890
You suppose he is carrying out some sort of research here?

1564
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:03,140
In fact, problems could be bone related.

1565
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:05,020
Yeah.

1566
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:06,740
I have bad...

1567
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:08,460
Well...

1568
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:09,000
I have...

1569
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,400
Now it's like my bad bones transferred into my ghost life.

1570
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,300
You know, it kind of sucks.

1571
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:18,820
Look at all these precision instruments and complicated
devices.

1572
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:20,700
Bear to the bone.

1573
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:21,360
Bear.

1574
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:24,400
Bear to the bone.

1575
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:27,740
Phantom pain.

1576
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:30,120
What are you doing?

1577
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:33,140
Sir, I think this might be how Lynn escaped.

1578
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:33,940
Through here.

1579
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:39,100
Through the poop chute.

1580
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:42,240
She couldn't possibly fit in that tiny little elevator.

1581
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:43,300
Why?

1582
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:43,980
I don't know, sir.

1583
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:45,220
Lynn is pretty slim.

1584
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:47,000
Why are you checking her out, huh?

1585
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:51,240
Don't you know that women can make themselves appear slim
through fashion?

1586
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:58,540
You think if you had four minutes, you could at least die
with better bones?

1587
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:01,640
Oh, my gosh.

1588
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:06,820
Four minutes before my death, I just shove all the magnesium
down my throat.

1589
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,960
The men found us out.

1590
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:16,880
No, what do you mean through...

1591
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,620
What are you talking about, Edgeworth?

1592
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,240
I mean, prosecutor pain.

1593
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:25,680
To this day, I still don't know how much my wife really
weighs.

1594
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:27,160
You don't need to know that.

1595
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:29,200
I'm very sorry.

1596
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,360
I had no idea, sir.

1597
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:34,280
You'll never make detective at that rate.

1598
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:35,340
This poor guy.

1599
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:38,240
This poor guy.

1600
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:41,260
Anyway, where is that old pigeon man?

1601
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:43,040
Oh, him, sir?

1602
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:44,400
He went through the door behind me, sir.

1603
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,240
Oh.

1604
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:47,240
That one right there.

1605
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:48,120
That door, yeah.

1606
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:51,920
It won't open.

1607
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:56,040
Apparently that door leads to the basement, but it's
currently locked, sir.

1608
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:59,240
I'm starting to get why his wife left.

1609
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:01,240
These are two different guys.

1610
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:06,440
Time to gotcha don't know timing again.

1611
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,440
This one was sent on 822 JST.

1612
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:14,560
A little over 10 minutes.

1613
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:15,800
Like 15 minutes?

1614
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:29,720
15 minutes not so bad these instruments they're all very
suspicious you'd better keep your eye on that old man too

1615
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:42,460
yes sir if it involves a criminal wouldn't you like bash the
door down to try and get in there you know like okay so we

1616
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:45,740
have examined these before but does he say anything
different now that Lynn's not here.

1617
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:48,340
Pictures of little fragments of rock.

1618
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:49,820
A little pigeon guy strange.

1619
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:51,060
Tasting wild decor.

1620
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,600
Okay, just a little bit.

1621
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,460
What is this gonna heat up?

1622
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:01,400
Oh!

1623
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:07,340
Oh!

1624
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:07,820
Wait!

1625
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,140
I can't... I can't attach myself to him anymore.

1626
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,000
I can't...

1627
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:16,160
Oh!

1628
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,080
I could swear I just saw this thing move!

1629
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:21,520
Don't tell me!

1630
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:23,040
This is a bit!

1631
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:29,040
I sense the tension between me and the detective and it
moved to get away from it.

1632
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:36,140
I think the detective, I think, or not the detective, this
guy might be my favorite character.

1633
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:37,900
Unnamed officer.

1634
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:39,780
He's so funny.

1635
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:45,340
I love unnamed officer.

1636
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:52,500
That was an unexpected tangent.

1637
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:55,740
I'll never make detective about this right now.

1638
01:38:57,460 --> 01:38:59,240
confidence in your soul!

1639
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:00,760
No!

1640
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:04,520
What I need is some sort of an achievement.

1641
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:05,560
Achievement.

1642
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:06,720
A feather in my cat.

1643
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:09,580
If only I could find a helpful lead that might...

1644
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:11,060
The book, the book, the book.

1645
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:14,820
A helpful and blindingly obvious lead is staring.

1646
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:16,980
You were in the face right now!

1647
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:19,940
There you go.

1648
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:30,080
I swallowed my spit wrong.

1649
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:34,180
This is... Lin's notebook.

1650
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,940
If I give this back to her, it might spark something
between.

1651
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,240
Spark something between us.

1652
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:41,960
What do you mean by that?

1653
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:45,000
Isn't she your family, detective?

1654
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:47,760
Um.

1655
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:50,960
What do you mean by that?

1656
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:56,080
Didn't you say she's your family?

1657
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:57,700
She's an angel.

1658
01:39:58,020 --> 01:39:58,680
No, a friend.

1659
01:39:58,980 --> 01:39:59,580
A family.

1660
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,060
What to do?

1661
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:02,700
What to do?

1662
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:04,340
This is a very complicated It didn't matter.

1663
01:40:09,850 --> 01:40:11,210
No, don't let him take your accomplishment.

1664
01:40:11,530 --> 01:40:12,630
Don't let him take your accomplishment.

1665
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:16,750
What have you got there?

1666
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:17,690
What?

1667
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:18,090
This?

1668
01:40:18,370 --> 01:40:20,350
Oh, this is...

1669
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:21,270
Wait a minute.

1670
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:22,490
Is that...

1671
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:23,290
Yes, sir.

1672
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:24,330
Yes, sir.

1673
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:25,830
It's Lynn's notebook, sir.

1674
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:27,130
Notebook, eh?

1675
01:40:27,530 --> 01:40:29,650
Come to think of it, there was something about that in the
report.

1676
01:40:30,330 --> 01:40:33,030
Something about her looking at her notebook and making a
phone call.

1677
01:40:35,110 --> 01:40:36,730
Don't let him take it from you!

1678
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:39,250
This must be it.

1679
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:42,030
This telephone number with a big circle around it.

1680
01:40:43,150 --> 01:40:44,710
Vivi Koi, thank you for the five gifted.

1681
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:45,490
Thank you.

1682
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:47,910
Aren't you curious to know who she was calling?

1683
01:40:48,910 --> 01:40:49,250
I am.

1684
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:50,070
It really am, sir.

1685
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:51,070
I'd like to know.

1686
01:40:52,030 --> 01:40:52,230
Oh.

1687
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:55,810
But I don't have any ulterior motive for wanting to know,
though.

1688
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:56,810
No, sir, no, sir.

1689
01:40:57,710 --> 01:40:58,390
No, sir.

1690
01:40:59,070 --> 01:41:03,650
This number might be an important lead.

1691
01:41:04,170 --> 01:41:05,190
I'd better check it out.

1692
01:41:08,190 --> 01:41:11,070
This music is so Phoenix Wright.

1693
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:19,170
Trick time!

1694
01:41:21,150 --> 01:41:23,130
When is this gonna go off, I wonder?

1695
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:27,110
I can't examine it yet.

1696
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:28,710
It's still closed.

1697
01:41:29,390 --> 01:41:30,470
I'd like to see what's inside.

1698
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:32,010
But this guy has a death grip on it.

1699
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:33,010
I can't open it.

1700
01:41:33,770 --> 01:41:36,750
I bet this detective never lets his prey escape once he gets
a hold of it.

1701
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:39,370
Here we go!

1702
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,660
To whom am I speaking, please?

1703
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:48,140
Yes, hello?

1704
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:51,320
This is a criminal investigation.

1705
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:52,700
We need your cooperation.

1706
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:54,520
Hey, I know that voice.

1707
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:55,180
Is that you?

1708
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:56,460
Detective McCaw?

1709
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,660
What did I call him?

1710
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,240
Detective... Detective McCaw?

1711
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,280
Oh, is that Officer Bailey?

1712
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:11,040
Detective.

1713
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:13,860
What's up, sir?

1714
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:15,240
You don't usually call this way.

1715
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:18,620
Oh, uh...

1716
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:20,840
Did she get a call from one of our detectives, Lynn,
earlier?

1717
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:22,600
From Lynn?

1718
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:23,700
Yes, I did.

1719
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:24,740
She calls every night.

1720
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,160
Maybe she senses it's about to happen.

1721
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,580
What is about to happen?

1722
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:30,480
Did she say anything special?

1723
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:32,220
No, not really.

1724
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,160
Is something wrong?

1725
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,320
Ah, well...

1726
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:36,660
Hold on.

1727
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:43,810
I might be contacting you again if I have any other
questions.

1728
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:47,770
Okay.

1729
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:51,090
Trace complete.

1730
01:42:52,270 --> 01:42:54,270
To that place.

1731
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:58,970
I'm going to go file the report down at the station.

1732
01:42:59,350 --> 01:43:01,230
I need you to be vigilant here.

1733
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:04,190
Excuse me, detective, but...

1734
01:43:04,190 --> 01:43:05,250
What is it?

1735
01:43:06,170 --> 01:43:07,150
I know, why am I...

1736
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:08,230
That guy's sitting...

1737
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:10,290
He's avoiding the gamer posture, you guys.

1738
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:10,770
Everybody...

1739
01:43:10,770 --> 01:43:12,870
That is peak sitting position.

1740
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:14,490
Everybody should know that.

1741
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:16,790
That's how I'm sitting literally right now.

1742
01:43:18,930 --> 01:43:26,050
You don't sit like that with your booty out and your chest
pushed forward like this.

1743
01:43:27,070 --> 01:43:27,750
Oh, yes.

1744
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:31,350
This is peak performance, obviously.

1745
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:36,550
Actually, let's all stretch.

1746
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:37,430
Oh, yeah.

1747
01:43:38,610 --> 01:43:39,130
Ow!

1748
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:42,590
Oh, my arm.

1749
01:43:44,450 --> 01:43:45,130
Sorry.

1750
01:43:45,370 --> 01:43:46,130
It's the pinch nerve.

1751
01:43:47,710 --> 01:43:48,830
Um, what was I saying?

1752
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:49,950
Oh, that notebook.

1753
01:43:50,670 --> 01:43:52,810
Would you mind if I gave...

1754
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:54,850
Oh, never mind, sir!

1755
01:43:56,610 --> 01:43:57,090
Humph.

1756
01:43:57,550 --> 01:43:58,690
Just stay on your toes.

1757
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:02,110
Grandma Mint, are you okay?

1758
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:03,670
Yeah, I'm fine.

1759
01:44:05,190 --> 01:44:05,750
I'm okay.

1760
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:09,010
Trick time.

1761
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:12,890
What is this gonna heat up?

1762
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:15,890
Maybe when we come back.

1763
01:44:18,290 --> 01:44:19,410
Maybe I have to wait.

1764
01:44:21,370 --> 01:44:22,450
He almost did it.

1765
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:22,910
You did.

1766
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:25,210
Let's go to that new place.

1767
01:44:34,450 --> 01:44:35,410
New people.

1768
01:44:36,190 --> 01:44:36,710
Oh no.

1769
01:44:38,170 --> 01:44:39,210
Oh my gosh, the shrimp.

1770
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:43,190
Was that...

1771
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:44,390
What was that call about?

1772
01:44:44,730 --> 01:44:45,650
I heard you say Lynn.

1773
01:44:47,670 --> 01:44:50,550
Oh, why is it still like that?

1774
01:44:51,390 --> 01:44:52,510
I don't really know.

1775
01:44:52,810 --> 01:44:57,450
If I had to take a guess, though, I would probably say
something's going on with her.

1776
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:00,730
Ha, ha.

1777
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:05,990
The only place in the world where nothing is going on is
inside your brain, Bailey.

1778
01:45:07,190 --> 01:45:08,150
Oh, bird.

1779
01:45:14,310 --> 01:45:18,280
What is that supposed to mean?

1780
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:21,340
I know what the words mean.

1781
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:22,720
That's not what I'm asking.

1782
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:27,360
That was my way of expressing indignation.

1783
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:29,780
Putting it in the form of a question.

1784
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:31,900
Oh.

1785
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:34,100
Sits back so polite.

1786
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:36,460
Is that guy drinking wine on the job?

1787
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:39,280
I just hope Lynn's not doing anything crazy.

1788
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:40,720
I'm a fan of hers, you know?

1789
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:43,900
According to my law, is she not a real detective?

1790
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:45,580
Is she like an actress?

1791
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:57,140
Is she like an actress playing the role of a detective and
like she's not actually she doesn't actually know anything

1792
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:12,960
just passed her test recently oh yeah it's so true according
to my log Lynn has been calling here nearly every night as

1793
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:23,020
of late so let's see this is the place Lynn took all that
risk to call eh but what exactly is this place trick down

1794
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:26,580
trick down Oh.

1795
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:28,500
Oh.

1796
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,080
Ah.

1797
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:32,460
Ah.

1798
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:32,880
Oh my gosh.

1799
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:34,440
Wait, the lever over there.

1800
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,000
You see it on the bottom, right?

1801
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:38,440
We can release all the inmates.

1802
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:41,720
Be free.

1803
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:44,480
Bro's posture.

1804
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:45,380
Look at this.

1805
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:47,300
Wow.

1806
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:51,020
I didn't know I would need the eye tracker for this stream.

1807
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:52,760
Late grants on 200K.

1808
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:54,760
I'm so proud of you and you're freaking amazing.

1809
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:56,040
Anikosu!

1810
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:56,840
Thank you!

1811
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:58,700
Thank you, thank you.

1812
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:04,560
I don't think we can do anything here.

1813
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:07,720
Except...

1814
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:09,620
Except get an eye full.

1815
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:15,600
I guess we'll go back.

1816
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:18,480
Oh wait!

1817
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,000
Oh!

1818
01:47:20,860 --> 01:47:21,880
Just kidding.

1819
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:24,300
I can let the memo loose.

1820
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:28,600
There's a phone over there too.

1821
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:32,500
Let's examine this monitor.

1822
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:35,660
The screen shows rows of tiny rooms.

1823
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:37,800
The rooms are really, really small.

1824
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:39,820
And you can see right into them from the outside.

1825
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:42,760
I suppose the open bars couldn't keep...

1826
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:46,400
Oh, the open bars keep the rooms airy.

1827
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:48,380
But I wouldn't want to live in one myself.

1828
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:51,100
I wonder where these little rooms are.

1829
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:54,640
I wonder...

1830
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:02,380
If I let myself go...

1831
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,280
Woo-hoo!

1832
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:11,470
Hey, what's this?

1833
01:48:14,150 --> 01:48:14,710
Oh, that?

1834
01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:18,410
I wrote down my duties for the night, so I wouldn't forget
any of them.

1835
01:48:19,810 --> 01:48:21,430
You can't keep them in your head.

1836
01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:23,830
It's not like you have a ton of duties.

1837
01:48:24,010 --> 01:48:25,510
Why did you put them in quotes like that?

1838
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:28,690
After all, use a little brain power.

1839
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:34,610
What are you talking about?

1840
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:36,530
Weren't you the one who said nothing?

1841
01:48:36,730 --> 01:48:43,130
You guys, it's so jover when I get 3D and I can be able to
do that every time I make a mistake in a video game.

1842
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:46,670
It's so over.

1843
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:50,430
I can't wait.

1844
01:48:53,070 --> 01:48:56,130
Weren't you the one who just said nothing was going on
inside my brain?

1845
01:48:58,170 --> 01:48:58,450
Hmm.

1846
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:00,450
Didn't think you'd take it quite...

1847
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:12,570
wait didn't think you'd take it in quite that direction what
else are you saying so let's see this important to-do list

1848
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:22,450

just made a request to use the phone a little while ago nine

1849
01:49:22,450 --> 01:49:33,090

can't let her talk to him tonight rules are rules.

1850
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:35,510
Aw, poor Lynn.

1851
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:36,970
Sure wish I could comfort her.

1852
01:49:49,850 --> 01:49:50,490
That's okay.

1853
01:49:51,010 --> 01:49:52,610
I've got it all memorized for you.

1854
01:49:53,970 --> 01:49:56,290
Well, it's your duty to guard the telephone room, you know.

1855
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:58,450
Right there.

1856
01:49:58,690 --> 01:50:01,050
Just make sure you do your job when the time comes.

1857
01:50:02,510 --> 01:50:03,790
These guys are so goofy.

1858
01:50:03,990 --> 01:50:04,390
I love it.

1859
01:50:04,890 --> 01:50:06,050
He's gonna put up another memo.

1860
01:50:06,190 --> 01:50:06,290
Oh.

1861
01:50:08,190 --> 01:50:08,890
Moshi Moshi.

1862
01:50:09,790 --> 01:50:09,870
Oh.

1863
01:50:13,250 --> 01:50:14,230
Is it Lynn?

1864
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:15,270
Oh, it's Lynn!

1865
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:19,910
Oh, spooky music.

1866
01:50:23,490 --> 01:50:24,070
Lynn!

1867
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:25,850
I'm sorry.

1868
01:50:26,170 --> 01:50:26,990
I don't have much time.

1869
01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:28,510
Please let me talk to him.

1870
01:50:29,110 --> 01:50:30,430
I'm sorry, detective.

1871
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:31,930
I can't do that tonight.

1872
01:50:32,910 --> 01:50:33,750
You can't?

1873
01:50:33,770 --> 01:50:35,390
But you always let me talk to him before.

1874
01:50:37,670 --> 01:50:40,210
Well, uh, the telephone room is already reserved.

1875
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:41,410
That's why.

1876
01:50:42,090 --> 01:50:43,730
Or he's dead.

1877
01:50:44,270 --> 01:50:47,790
Dun, dun, dun, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

1878
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:49,330
Oh.

1879
01:50:50,790 --> 01:50:52,930
By the way, is something going on with you tonight?

1880
01:50:54,630 --> 01:50:54,890
What?

1881
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:55,830
Why do you ask?

1882
01:50:56,470 --> 01:50:59,930
I got a call from one of the other detectives a minute ago
asking about you.

1883
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:02,050
Oh, really?

1884
01:51:02,550 --> 01:51:05,070
Oh, well, I don't think it's anything important.

1885
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:06,390
Officer Bailey?

1886
01:51:07,310 --> 01:51:09,330
Do you think you could keep this call just between us?

1887
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:11,110
Even if only for tonight?

1888
01:51:12,530 --> 01:51:18,430
Well, I Oh, look at the time I gotta go, I'll call again
tomorrow

1889
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:31,070
Dang, I didn't even say Bye, he hung up on her Mysterious
Place Oh boy, well I guess I'd better call the detective

1890
01:51:31,070 --> 01:51:32,030
Division, no!

1891
01:51:33,690 --> 01:51:35,190
Snitches, snitches, snitches

1892
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:45,450
Don't do it, Officer Bailey Don't do Hold on there, Bailey.

1893
01:51:47,790 --> 01:51:50,370
Don't tell me you're going to report that call from Lynn.

1894
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:52,510
What else can I do?

1895
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:53,770
It's my duty.

1896
01:51:54,810 --> 01:51:57,270
Just write it down on one of your important to-do lists.

1897
01:51:57,890 --> 01:52:00,270
And then I can wad it up for you and throw it away.

1898
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:08,060
You mean you want me to keep quiet about it?

1899
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:08,900
Wow.

1900
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:12,940
Well, isn't that what she asked you to...

1901
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:13,840
Why were you...

1902
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:15,360
Why were you...

1903
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:17,580
eavesdropping on our call, huh?

1904
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:24,260
Well, yes, but tonight is kind of a special case for us.

1905
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:27,520
Can't you make a special exception for my...

1906
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,000
What is

1907
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:35,370
up with all these people claiming Lynn?

1908
01:52:38,190 --> 01:52:40,110
Lynn does not belong to all of you.

1909
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:41,350
She belongs to me!

1910
01:52:45,910 --> 01:52:48,170
I won't let all of you, any of you have her.

1911
01:52:48,770 --> 01:52:49,530
Hands off!

1912
01:52:49,850 --> 01:52:50,570
Hands off!

1913
01:52:50,710 --> 01:52:51,410
Hands off!

1914
01:52:55,170 --> 01:52:55,970
Oh, Nen!

1915
01:52:56,530 --> 01:52:57,070
No, Lin!

1916
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:08,720
Special case, huh?

1917
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,380
Alright, you win.

1918
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:16,920
Trick time.

1919
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,360
Wait, so...

1920
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:19,960
What is he gonna say?

1921
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:24,420
I don't know what they think is special about tonight, but
for me, it's my only night.

1922
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,620
Lin is on the other end of that telephone line.

1923
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:27,360
I better hurry.

1924
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:31,580
Yeah, I was gonna do his little memo, but...

1925
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:58,780
I guess we'll go I guess we'll dial To here Hourlin No No No
way No Is it a rock I was gonna say a locked room case I

1926
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:02,760
said a rock Is she dead again?

1927
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:06,260
Lynn!

1928
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:12,010
Oh, why could it have been me instead?

1929
01:54:12,870 --> 01:54:14,490
I'm no use as a police officer.

1930
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:16,010
It should have been...

1931
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:19,130
It should have been me!

1932
01:54:19,550 --> 01:54:20,330
Not her!

1933
01:54:23,610 --> 01:54:25,550
It should have been me!

1934
01:54:27,310 --> 01:54:29,210
It should have been me!

1935
01:54:33,150 --> 01:54:34,970
It looks like she's dead.

1936
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:36,650
We'd better not touch her.

1937
01:54:38,410 --> 01:54:39,330
Who shot?

1938
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:42,610
Why do you assume it's a shot?

1939
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:43,990
A gunshot, huh?

1940
01:54:48,010 --> 01:54:49,230
Why do you assume that, officer?

1941
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:52,570
Hey, excuse me, mister.

1942
01:54:55,170 --> 01:54:55,930
Sumi masun.

1943
01:54:56,610 --> 01:54:57,330
You talking to me?

1944
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:00,290
Whoa.

1945
01:55:00,910 --> 01:55:01,490
This room.

1946
01:55:02,630 --> 01:55:03,430
There aren't any...

1947
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:04,750
It is a locked room case.

1948
01:55:04,890 --> 01:55:06,350
It is a locked room case.

1949
01:55:07,590 --> 01:55:09,650
There aren't any other exits besides this one, are there?

1950
01:55:09,670 --> 01:55:09,890
there?

1951
01:55:10,730 --> 01:55:11,810
Do you see one?

1952
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:15,750
Well, there's like a hatch below.

1953
01:55:16,410 --> 01:55:16,550
Huh?

1954
01:55:17,090 --> 01:55:18,330
And how did...

1955
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:22,950
We must have one of those mysterious locked room murder
cases on our hands!

1956
01:55:23,290 --> 01:55:23,930
Yippee!

1957
01:55:24,590 --> 01:55:25,230
Murder!

1958
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:26,470
Yeah!

1959
01:55:27,290 --> 01:55:31,150
One of those cases where the murderer vanishes into thin air
in a vacuum.

1960
01:55:32,190 --> 01:55:34,010
Just go find a real detective.

1961
01:55:34,750 --> 01:55:36,110
It's Umineko, let's go!

1962
01:55:36,890 --> 01:55:38,450
I'll keep watch here.

1963
01:55:39,110 --> 01:55:46,510
No, there like a trap door in the middle of the room is this
guy not a suspect why are we letting him stay with the body

1964
01:55:46,510 --> 01:55:57,290
ah what a terrible turn of events so now a locked room
murder a things never get dull for our redhead I know of a

1965
01:55:57,290 --> 01:56:05,390
certain inspector who might dance around at the thought of a
mystery me but no mysteries for me not when I can rewind

1966
01:56:05,390 --> 01:56:13,990
time and talk to the victim herself guess it's time to go
back and see the truth behind this murder with my own eyes

1967
01:56:13,990 --> 01:56:32,330
beep beep beep beep I'm going ghost I'm going lamp I'm going
girl or goose haha I died again I thought you'd be a little

1968
01:56:32,330 --> 01:56:39,430
more grave under the circumstances this man she's not she's
not caring about her death at all she doesn't care she's

1969
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:45,410
she's just like not when I have you around a rewind time I

1970
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:58,190
died to hit pero I died so silly I died how

1971
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:15,400
silly of me oh my gosh I just keep getting murdered that's
so silly of me yeah well this is the third time after all

1972
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:22,980
it's scary what a girl can get used to don't you think
frankly the way her mind works is a whole heck of a lot

1973
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:36,120
scarier to me just feeling a little guilty feeling a little
goofy might die tonight so what happened this time who shot

1974
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:39,060
you I don't home.

1975
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:40,640
Nani?

1976
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,060
I'd like to know myself.

1977
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:44,560
Who could have done it?

1978
01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:47,140
Who shot me?

1979
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:48,640
Why?

1980
01:57:48,980 --> 01:57:50,320
What are you asking me for?

1981
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:51,980
Oh boy.

1982
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:54,000
Guess I'll have to go find out for myself.

1983
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:55,580
Okay.

1984
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:57,000
You just go do that.

1985
01:57:57,340 --> 01:57:58,140
Hurry along now.

1986
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:03,620
I get the distinct impression I'm being used here.

1987
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:05,540
Translator note.

1988
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:06,580
Nani means what?

1989
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:08,560
Okay.

1990
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,620
Looks like it's time to go back.

1991
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:13,980
Back to four minutes before your death.

1992
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:23,180
Let's see.

1993
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:25,700
She called.

1994
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:27,440
844.

1995
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:29,480
Lots of fours in this game, huh?

1996
01:58:32,140 --> 01:58:32,700
Okay.

1997
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:34,260
She hears something going on.

1998
01:58:34,700 --> 01:58:34,820
Oh.

1999
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:36,540
The doctor.

2000
01:58:36,820 --> 01:58:37,940
He looks really frightened.

2001
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:42,700
How long has it been since I locked this room up in
darkness?

2002
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:43,880
Okay.

2003
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:44,240
He's a weird guy.

2004
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:56,920
I thought I once thought the truth could be discovered in
darkness oh my god the Matroska dolls look so scary maybe it

2005
01:58:56,920 --> 01:59:04,260
was just that the time wasn't ripe yeah see there's a little
thing in the middle of the floor wait so it's not only just

2006
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:08,780
a locked room case but it's also dark oh

2007
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:20,500
she's hiding oh my god she can hide in there the guy was so
right She...

2008
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:21,860
Oh my gosh.

2009
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:26,400
That was so smooth.

2010
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:31,040
With the power of fashion.

2011
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:34,740
Mooshy mooshy.

2012
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:41,180
He hung up.

2013
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:44,520
Oh, it's boiling.

2014
01:59:44,780 --> 01:59:45,140
Ow!

2015
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:46,620
His behind.

2016
01:59:51,150 --> 01:59:53,990
Okay, there's a lot going on here.

2017
01:59:55,250 --> 01:59:56,010
There's Henya!

2018
01:59:56,330 --> 01:59:56,590
Yeah!

2019
01:59:57,870 --> 02:00:00,270
Okay, goes into the dark room.

2020
02:00:00,810 --> 02:00:01,310
Tipy toe.

2021
02:00:02,270 --> 02:00:03,930
There's a lot of contraptions in here.

2022
02:00:06,570 --> 02:00:07,290
Uh oh.

2023
02:00:07,730 --> 02:00:09,710
Oh no, I don't think you should have done that!

2024
02:00:10,130 --> 02:00:10,570
Oh my god.

2025
02:00:12,710 --> 02:00:15,050
And it lights that on fire.

2026
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:17,910
And then...

2027
02:00:17,910 --> 02:00:19,250
No way.

2028
02:00:21,850 --> 02:00:22,490
What?!

2029
02:00:22,490 --> 02:00:24,510
Don't just stand there!

2030
02:00:26,650 --> 02:00:28,130
It's a booby trap!

2031
02:00:30,370 --> 02:00:33,330
That's the truth behind our locked room murder!

2032
02:00:33,530 --> 02:00:40,070
Okay, I saw the gun up there and I thought that it would
probably be the thing that shot her, but that's...

2033
02:00:41,630 --> 02:00:44,050
We got home alone for real!

2034
02:00:46,970 --> 02:00:50,050
So the murderer was a mechanical murder machine!

2035
02:00:50,070 --> 02:00:52,370
The murder machine.

2036
02:00:52,850 --> 02:00:56,390
When I came into the room, it was pitch dark, so I turned on
the light.

2037
02:00:58,050 --> 02:00:59,410
That must have been what set it off.

2038
02:00:59,730 --> 02:01:01,230
The murder machine, I mean.

2039
02:01:02,290 --> 02:01:04,690
Can you please stop repeating the words murder machine?

2040
02:01:05,710 --> 02:01:07,470
That old pigeon guy must have made it.

2041
02:01:07,570 --> 02:01:08,250
But why?

2042
02:01:09,330 --> 02:01:11,110
What could be the meaning behind this?

2043
02:01:11,190 --> 02:01:12,810
He's trying to figure something out.

2044
02:01:13,730 --> 02:01:15,090
But he needs the...

2045
02:01:15,090 --> 02:01:16,150
He's hiding it.

2046
02:01:16,170 --> 02:01:20,030
If someone comes in to steal his research, they're going to
get murdered.

2047
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:21,690
By the murder machine!

2048
02:01:23,110 --> 02:01:25,950
Anyway, you'll have to find some way to stop that creepy
machine.

2049
02:01:26,910 --> 02:01:29,250
Once Cupid fires his arrow, it's all over.

2050
02:01:34,510 --> 02:01:35,550
Rewind time.

2051
02:01:38,050 --> 02:01:39,090
Trick time.

2052
02:01:39,730 --> 02:01:40,850
Oh, we're starting from here?

2053
02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:42,110
Interesting.

2054
02:01:47,970 --> 02:01:48,770
What is it?

2055
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:49,470
You know what, Cicel?

2056
02:01:50,070 --> 02:01:53,890
I think this death might be easier to prevent than the
others.

2057
02:01:54,630 --> 02:01:55,190
Why is that?

2058
02:01:55,790 --> 02:01:57,810
You know, because the murderer is mechanical.

2059
02:01:58,910 --> 02:02:05,340
She has- Did I just disconnect?

2060
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:06,220
Am I good?

2061
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:13,260
I'm good?

2062
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:14,020
Oh, okay.

2063
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:16,440
For a second.

2064
02:02:17,740 --> 02:02:17,820
Hmm.

2065
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:18,900
Strange.

2066
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:20,320
Sorry about that.

2067
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:25,780
I can't manipulate living creatures, but I can manipulate
this machine.

2068
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:28,000
Now I just gotta figure out how to stop it.

2069
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:34,780
When the four minutes ago, me, turns on the light, that's
when the murder machine is set in motion, apparently.

2070
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:41,120
So it looks like the key to solving this one is
understanding this device.

2071
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:43,720
Which I think we kind of get.

2072
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:51,660
Oh yes, locked up in the room in darkness, something,
something, this time is not right.

2073
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:55,880
We can infiltrate the lamp.

2074
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:03,900
Oh, interesting.

2075
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:08,840
I don't think me going to...

2076
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:09,760
Oh, wait, but no, no.

2077
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:11,080
There's the motor up top.

2078
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:12,340
We do have to go upstairs.

2079
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:16,200
I think we have to wait for the guy to...

2080
02:03:16,660 --> 02:03:19,700
To call, and then we go through, right?

2081
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:21,540
Wait.

2082
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:23,020
Oh, the telephone isn't working.

2083
02:03:23,220 --> 02:03:26,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2084
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:27,200
Okay.

2085
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:30,460
Because there was the motor up top.

2086
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,700
So we'll wait for it to ring.

2087
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:36,460
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring,

2088
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:40,510
ring.

2089
02:03:41,130 --> 02:03:42,590
And he slides down.

2090
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:45,050
All cool time is passing.

2091
02:03:48,330 --> 02:03:48,610
Okay.

2092
02:03:50,690 --> 02:03:51,610
Is this the superintendent?

2093
02:03:52,510 --> 02:03:53,190
I'm so glad.

2094
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:54,310
I thought I was all alone.

2095
02:03:57,650 --> 02:03:58,770
Go there.

2096
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:01,050
Okay.

2097
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:04,960
Okay.

2098
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:12,540
Okay, he hung up.

2099
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:14,840
Trick time!

2100
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:20,260
Okay, maybe we stop this from going off on your butt.

2101
02:04:21,900 --> 02:04:22,000
Oh!

2102
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:28,780
And then you're gonna move it down here?

2103
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:36,490
Oh, this poor guy!

2104
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:47,360
This is the Shinji pose for real.

2105
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:49,700
Oh my gosh, Lynn ran away.

2106
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:51,340
The detectives yelled at me.

2107
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:53,360
The old pigeon man ignored me.

2108
02:04:53,580 --> 02:04:55,860
Oh no, he's never going to become a detective at this rate.

2109
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:58,460
And then the kettle nearly scared me to death.

2110
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:01,060
My life is incomplete!

2111
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:02,020
Shambles!

2112
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:06,280
That's gratitude for you.

2113
02:05:06,780 --> 02:05:09,860
We were just trying to warn him with the kettle whistle.

2114
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:13,640
Would he have preferred getting scalded by the steam?

2115
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,900
Well, at least his fate was changed a bit.

2116
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:33,240
in his butt that's good anyway the fate has been changed for
real okay so the ball okay how did it go again uh the

2117
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:45,600
presence the the thing started spinning the fan started
spinning lifting the present and the ball spun over uh if uh

don't know what this does.

2121
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:20,800
Oh no!

2122
02:06:20,980 --> 02:06:21,240
Oh no!

2123
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:21,400
No!

2124
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:21,600
No!

2125
02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:22,280
Oh my god.

2126
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:23,080
Wait!

2127
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:24,160
Oh, I messed up!

2128
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:24,800
Maybe.

2129
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:29,280
What did the bowling ball even do before?

2130
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:32,520
Actually, I have no idea.

2131
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:34,260
Uh.

2132
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:36,440
I missed it.

2133
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:37,540
Yeah, I think I did.

2134
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:39,040
Uh.

2135
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:41,600
Oopsie!

2136
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:47,940
That's okay.

2137
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:56,120
we can go from when the fate was changed the key to this
murder machine is that cheeky little cupid who fires the

2138
02:06:56,120 --> 02:07:04,220
arrow but we were close we were so close we were close we
were close we were close very tight timing yeah but wait a

2139
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:13,340
minute that swinging shovel yes yes yes I wonder if that can
be used as a weapon somehow against our cupid guess I'd

2140
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:25,400
better rewind yes after the fate change okay this trick to
feel long time when i first played it i think we're um it's

2141
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:35,660
not so bad maybe maybe i hope not we'll see okay here we go
do

2142
02:07:40,770 --> 02:07:44,590
i need to what do i do with this though i

2143
02:07:59,010 --> 02:08:04,810
don't remember if the did the shovel like fling into the air
really fast

2144
02:08:08,130 --> 02:08:13,390
No spoil, no hints, no hints, no hints, no hints, no hints,
everybody, no hints.

2145
02:08:15,170 --> 02:08:16,790
Oh my god, I would do timing.

2146
02:08:17,990 --> 02:08:18,690
Oh, no, it doesn't.

2147
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:20,130
It just...

2148
02:08:20,130 --> 02:08:20,610
Okay.

2149
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:34,820
I'm trying to look at everything that I can possess.

2150
02:08:47,540 --> 02:08:48,920
Timing is everything.

2151
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:56,220
Yeah, Lynn's gonna just keep getting blasted, man.

2152
02:08:58,160 --> 02:09:01,220
Um, think about the timing as well.

2153
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:03,820
Yeah.

2154
02:09:06,060 --> 02:09:07,180
That's true.

2155
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:36,000
Cookment, I believe you?

2156
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:38,640
Sometimes it just takes me a second, okay?

2157
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:47,160
Some people said it took them a long time to get started.

2158
02:09:47,900 --> 02:09:50,460
What is that thing behind the box?

2159
02:09:50,660 --> 02:09:51,760
I don't even know what that is.

2160
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:54,600
The murder machine is started!

2161
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:58,440
The whole thing plays out that gun will go off before that
happens.

2162
02:09:58,820 --> 02:10:00,040
I need to use my ghost tricks.

2163
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:03,380
Must be some way to disrupt this domino effect.

2164
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:05,900
I just have to find it.

2165
02:10:07,100 --> 02:10:07,700
Oh, wait!

2166
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:09,260
Oh, shoot.

2167
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:10,460
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2168
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:14,060
I think when the ball...

2169
02:10:14,060 --> 02:10:17,060
When the ball lands, I have to...

2170
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:27,600
the ball landing to the shovel falling so it will so it will
go it will swing it up i think is what i have to do

2171
02:10:32,650 --> 02:10:34,710
oh my god maybe now

2172
02:10:43,370 --> 02:10:51,390
that was pretty good just now maybe if we were on a on a
putting green with a swing like that maybe we could put it

2173
02:10:51,390 --> 02:10:58,210
to use here good thinking i was just i just might be able to
use this trick somehow if i could change the path the ball

2174
02:10:58,210 --> 02:11:01,850
takes Change... Okay.

2175
02:11:04,110 --> 02:11:05,710
Change the path the ball takes.

2176
02:11:06,250 --> 02:11:09,110
That's great and all, but it looks like we're all out of
time this round.

2177
02:11:10,550 --> 02:11:11,170
Is it this?

2178
02:11:11,530 --> 02:11:12,530
What does this go to?

2179
02:11:15,510 --> 02:11:17,270
Oh, I guess I'll never know.

2180
02:11:22,510 --> 02:11:22,950
Hmm.

2181
02:11:25,290 --> 02:11:25,730
Okay.

2182
02:11:27,370 --> 02:11:27,810
Okay.

2183
02:11:30,230 --> 02:11:31,130
We got this.

2184
02:11:33,370 --> 02:11:35,510
Okay, after the fight change.

2185
02:11:36,990 --> 02:11:37,330
Okay.

2186
02:11:37,330 --> 02:11:39,330
But what does the...

2187
02:11:43,250 --> 02:11:43,790
Okay.

2188
02:11:46,370 --> 02:11:48,530
I still don't know what that thing down there is.

2189
02:11:50,610 --> 02:11:52,170
And would this be...

2190
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:53,890
Wait, how would we change the direction?

2191
02:11:56,210 --> 02:11:58,150
How would we change the direction?

2192
02:11:59,830 --> 02:12:00,350
Wow.

2193
02:12:02,450 --> 02:12:03,930
Why doesn't Lynn dodge it?

2194
02:12:04,050 --> 02:12:04,690
Is she stupid?

2195
02:12:07,290 --> 02:12:08,170
Maybe a little.

2196
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:12,110
Oh, I can't reach it.

2197
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,060
Can I reach here?

2198
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:20,580
I don't know if this does anything, but I'm going to try it.

2199
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:23,960
Here we go.

2200
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:25,480
Bend here.

2201
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:27,880
And...

2202
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:29,840
I don't know if this will do anything.

2203
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:30,480
Open!

2204
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:31,600
Oh, gosh.

2205
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:34,420
No.

2206
02:12:34,700 --> 02:12:35,020
That didn't.

2207
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:35,900
do anything.

2208
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:40,780
How do I change it?

2209
02:12:49,410 --> 02:12:56,310
Um, I don't know if it will let me go back into the ball
when I push it.

2210
02:12:57,250 --> 02:12:58,270
But maybe, let's see.

2211
02:12:58,850 --> 02:12:59,870
Ride the ball after it's hit.

2212
02:12:59,970 --> 02:13:01,590
That's why I'm gonna see if I can do.

2213
02:13:02,330 --> 02:13:14,050
I don't know if it will let me if it counts as a cutscene or
if it will let me little bit i have no idea we'll see oh

2214
02:13:14,050 --> 02:13:23,710
before it falls no but i have to i have to open the toolbox
oh but you mean like wait

2215
02:13:28,740 --> 02:13:42,140
maybe like with the most tightest of timings oh no i
wouldn't let me ghost trick no oh no it won't let me No, let

2216
02:13:42,140 --> 02:13:43,420
me...

2217
02:13:44,140 --> 02:13:50,820
Yeah, it's a cutscene.

2218
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:56,000
Hmm.

2219
02:13:57,940 --> 02:13:59,360
This one's tricky.

2220
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:02,840
This one's kind of tricky.

2221
02:14:10,110 --> 02:14:12,550
This box...

2222
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:14,650
I don't know how to reach it.

2223
02:14:17,230 --> 02:14:17,630
Unless...

2224
02:14:19,030 --> 02:14:20,450
Okay, hold on, let me try something.

2225
02:14:21,070 --> 02:14:23,710
Unless when the ball is on the table, I can go to it.

2226
02:14:24,770 --> 02:14:26,950
And then it does whatever it does.

2227
02:14:27,110 --> 02:14:29,850
I'm not sure what it does, but it might do something.

2228
02:14:36,270 --> 02:14:39,030
Oh no, it's just a toy cake!

2229
02:14:39,170 --> 02:14:39,650
Are you serious?

2230
02:14:40,190 --> 02:14:40,350
Wait!

2231
02:14:40,810 --> 02:14:42,410
Door, door, door, door, door, door!

2232
02:14:43,710 --> 02:14:44,110
Door!

2233
02:14:44,110 --> 02:14:44,330
Door!

2234
02:14:44,330 --> 02:14:44,490
Door!

2235
02:14:48,130 --> 02:14:49,550
There we go.

2236
02:15:04,660 --> 02:15:05,760
Oh, oh my gosh.

2237
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:07,840
I thought it just set everything on fire.

2238
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:11,420
What just happened?

2239
02:15:12,580 --> 02:15:16,220
Looks like your future just got a whole lot rosier.

2240
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:19,680
Happy birthday!

2241
02:15:22,260 --> 02:15:24,040
Your death has been erased.

2242
02:15:24,660 --> 02:15:25,280
E-git!

2243
02:15:26,780 --> 02:15:28,400
I, uh, thank you.

2244
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:31,620
You kept your promise, didn't you, Sissel?

2245
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:33,360
My promise?

2246
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:35,400
And now she can escape through the trap door.

2247
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:38,440
You said I'd see you again if I died.

2248
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:40,900
I don't remember making any promises.

2249
02:15:41,560 --> 02:15:43,300
It's all for my own benefit anyway.

2250
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,080
Fate averse.

2251
02:15:47,580 --> 02:15:49,080
What could this room be all about?

2252
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:50,860
I can't imagine.

2253
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:53,160
Those things that went off at the end.

2254
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:54,160
Those were party poppers.

2255
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:55,380
Oh no, did they hear them?

2256
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:56,260
Did they hear the potty pop?

2257
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:57,860
What potty is the potty?

2258
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,920
The party poppers!

2259
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:03,200
I have no recollection of what they are.

2260
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:04,440
But that's no surprise.

2261
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:08,760
I said it with an accent, you guys.

2262
02:16:09,020 --> 02:16:10,300
The party poppers.

2263
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:12,120
I just said it with an accent.

2264
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:14,160
I didn't say party poppers.

2265
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:16,060
I said the party poppers.

2266
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:19,460
It's the party poppers.

2267
02:16:20,040 --> 02:16:21,200
The party poppers.

2268
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:22,160
The gun going off.

2269
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:23,580
It seems familiar somehow.

2270
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:27,000
I'll leave that part of the puzzle to you.

2271
02:16:27,320 --> 02:16:28,980
I have my own puzzle to tell you.

2272
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:29,760
figure out.

2273
02:16:30,680 --> 02:16:31,940
Well, shall we go back now?

2274
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:33,660
Back to your new present?

2275
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:36,100
Sayonara!

2276
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:41,400
No saving this one, boss!

2277
02:16:41,580 --> 02:16:42,440
What do you mean?

2278
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:47,040
Okay, now you can leave.

2279
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:49,760
Or you can investigate what's going on in here.

2280
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:51,680
Cicil, are you there?

2281
02:16:52,300 --> 02:16:53,360
Oh, she remembers me.

2282
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:55,320
Lynn is talking to me?

2283
02:16:57,480 --> 02:17:00,960
Uh, If you're there, could you say something?

2284
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:02,580
If you're not there.

2285
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:05,880
I guess I'm just a weird girl who talks to herself.

2286
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:07,680
She remembers.

2287
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:10,100
Well, you are kind of a weird girl.

2288
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:12,280
Whether you talk to yourself or not.

2289
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:14,580
Trick time.

2290
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:15,620
What do we say?

2291
02:17:18,740 --> 02:17:19,180
Talk?

2292
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:19,720
Wait.

2293
02:17:23,690 --> 02:17:24,690
You are here.

2294
02:17:24,750 --> 02:17:25,530
I knew it.

2295
02:17:25,790 --> 02:17:27,050
I just had that feeling.

2296
02:17:27,330 --> 02:17:27,970
Wait, what?

2297
02:17:28,870 --> 02:17:30,730
Shame on you for stepping foot into a...

2298
02:17:30,750 --> 02:17:32,210
a girl's head uninvited.

2299
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:34,090
Wait a minute.

2300
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:39,010
Posh meant my beloved.

2301
02:17:42,570 --> 02:17:43,570
Don't give me that.

2302
02:17:43,870 --> 02:17:47,370
A ghost doesn't have feet, but I have feet.

2303
02:17:48,530 --> 02:17:49,030
Sometimes.

2304
02:17:50,130 --> 02:17:51,430
It's just a figure of speech.

2305
02:17:51,710 --> 02:17:53,230
It depends on how much energy I have.

2306
02:17:54,170 --> 02:17:56,170
How much ghostly energy I have, you know?

2307
02:17:57,470 --> 02:17:58,550
Yeah, but she did invite him.

2308
02:17:58,610 --> 02:17:59,110
So true.

2309
02:17:59,630 --> 02:18:01,070
Hey, did I say anything?

2310
02:18:02,410 --> 02:18:05,530
That tone, it's that tone of yours that makes me mad.

2311
02:18:07,230 --> 02:18:08,450
Oh, sorry, she has an accent now.

2312
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:11,370
So did you have something particular you wanted to say to
me?

2313
02:18:12,890 --> 02:18:13,970
Hmm, in British.

2314
02:18:14,850 --> 02:18:17,250
I just thought I'd share some information with you.

2315
02:18:17,890 --> 02:18:19,810
I'm investigating a case right now.

2316
02:18:20,590 --> 02:18:23,630
A murder case, and I'm doing it alone.

2317
02:18:25,750 --> 02:18:28,410
A murder case, all by yourself?

2318
02:18:29,830 --> 02:18:32,330
Yes, well, that's because the case was closed.

2319
02:18:32,410 --> 02:18:43,910
long time ago the culprit is already behind bars forgotten
by the world I think it's the lamp I think it's the lamp

2320
02:18:43,910 --> 02:18:55,910
making amends so why are you look or the person that was
murdered by the lamp I mean the guy behind bars so

2321
02:19:01,210 --> 02:19:09,050
why are you looking into it then because I think the
person's innocent that's why There's something strange

2322
02:19:09,050 --> 02:19:09,810
behind the case.

2323
02:19:10,190 --> 02:19:11,370
Some big mystery.

2324
02:19:11,770 --> 02:19:13,130
I firmly believe that.

2325
02:19:14,090 --> 02:19:17,390
So anyway, I finally have my memory back.

2326
02:19:17,790 --> 02:19:20,750
I'm not at liberty to tell you about the case.

2327
02:19:21,950 --> 02:19:22,730
But if there's any...

2328
02:19:22,730 --> 02:19:24,410
I'm so sorry if you're British, by the way.

2329
02:19:25,310 --> 02:19:26,050
Because you're British.

2330
02:19:26,250 --> 02:19:29,090
And also because I'm probably really butchering this accent.

2331
02:19:33,190 --> 02:19:37,470
But if there's anything else you want to know, I'll try to
answer what I can.

2332
02:19:39,690 --> 02:19:41,410
We deserve it.

2333
02:19:41,570 --> 02:19:42,070
No.

2334
02:19:43,750 --> 02:19:45,130
Played by Emma Watson.

2335
02:19:45,350 --> 02:19:46,430
That's who I'm channeling.

2336
02:19:47,050 --> 02:19:48,130
Lynn is my only lead.

2337
02:19:48,570 --> 02:19:51,110
I would like to ask her about a few things.

2338
02:19:52,710 --> 02:19:53,530
About the girl with the bow.

2339
02:19:53,670 --> 02:19:54,110
Oh, yeah.

2340
02:19:54,690 --> 02:19:56,370
What about about the dog?

2341
02:19:58,010 --> 02:20:00,450
You have your life and your memory back now.

2342
02:20:00,930 --> 02:20:01,970
So let me ask you again.

2343
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:03,870
Who shot me tonight?

2344
02:20:05,530 --> 02:20:07,690
Yeah, I thought that might be the first time.

2345
02:20:07,710 --> 02:20:16,030
thing on your mind what else would it be there's a good
chance i was shot while i was with you after all i'm afraid

2346
02:20:16,030 --> 02:20:26,250
my memory just isn't clear on that part not clear i met with
you tonight and then you fell down right in front of me i

2347
02:20:26,250 --> 02:20:37,990
think i remember seeing that part i'm pretty sure you were
shot maybe from somewhere far away two steps ahead so you

2348
02:20:37,990 --> 02:20:46,690
didn't see the culprit I'm sorry I wish I could be a more
help but I know I wasn't the one who shot you your

2349
02:20:46,690 --> 02:20:56,050
colleagues seem to think you're a suspect though I wanted
the information you had for me so why would I shoot you

2350
02:20:56,050 --> 02:21:01,690
before I got it so true information huh I wonder what info I
had for her.

2351
02:21:01,910 --> 02:21:02,350
It's me.

2352
02:21:02,770 --> 02:21:04,250
I was the murderer.

2353
02:21:07,090 --> 02:21:08,310
About the dog.

2354
02:21:08,650 --> 02:21:09,170
Oh, dang.

2355
02:21:09,430 --> 02:21:10,530
About the girl with the bow.

2356
02:21:12,490 --> 02:21:14,710
By the way, I see you have a little roommate.

2357
02:21:16,130 --> 02:21:18,030
Camilla, how do you know about her?

2358
02:21:19,170 --> 02:21:22,790
There was a tiny incident at your apartment a little while
ago.

2359
02:21:24,170 --> 02:21:24,670
An incident?

2360
02:21:25,230 --> 02:21:26,050
What kind of incident?

2361
02:21:27,310 --> 02:21:28,050
What happened?

2362
02:21:28,370 --> 02:21:29,350
Is Camilla alright?

2363
02:21:30,530 --> 02:21:33,170
She's fine, thanks to her loyal little friend.

2364
02:21:34,390 --> 02:21:34,990
Missile!

2365
02:21:35,610 --> 02:21:39,490
Yeah, Missile is a good boy, Missile, Missile.

2366
02:21:40,530 --> 02:21:43,830
Although I did have a little trouble bringing him back to
life.

2367
02:21:44,890 --> 02:21:47,190
Oh my, oh, it's horrible.

2368
02:21:47,790 --> 02:21:48,730
Oh my god.

2369
02:21:50,010 --> 02:21:50,890
Bloody hell.

2370
02:21:51,310 --> 02:21:52,770
What in the world is going on?

2371
02:21:53,050 --> 02:21:56,150
Why would anybody target to hurt Camilla and Missile?

2372
02:21:56,990 --> 02:21:59,590
You're being targeted by a certain organization.

2373
02:22:00,410 --> 02:22:02,070
Missile mention, yeah!

2374
02:22:03,690 --> 02:22:03,850
What?

2375
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:06,450
I saw them.

2376
02:22:06,830 --> 02:22:08,770
The people who were calling you their target.

2377
02:22:11,750 --> 02:22:13,230
So I'm a suspect and a target.

2378
02:22:13,990 --> 02:22:16,050
Could this night possibly get any worse?

2379
02:22:17,470 --> 02:22:18,490
This sound pretty rough.

2380
02:22:19,090 --> 02:22:21,070
Are you sure you'll be okay on your own?

2381
02:22:21,950 --> 02:22:23,390
Englishman is killing me.

2382
02:22:23,690 --> 02:22:24,090
Sorry.

2383
02:22:25,390 --> 02:22:25,510
Huh?

2384
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,270
You know what they say.

2385
02:22:27,570 --> 02:22:29,890
When it rains, it pour.

2386
02:22:32,210 --> 02:22:34,550
Isn't it time you admitted you need me?

2387
02:22:35,030 --> 02:22:36,150
Need my powers?

2388
02:22:38,010 --> 02:22:39,090
I'm sorry.

2389
02:22:39,710 --> 02:22:41,490
I can't cooperate with you.

2390
02:22:43,490 --> 02:22:44,590
Yes, you saved my life tonight.

2391
02:22:44,730 --> 02:22:46,070
Three times!

2392
02:22:48,350 --> 02:22:49,910
I'm completely grateful for that.

2393
02:22:51,110 --> 02:22:53,290
But as a detective, I still can't trust you.

2394
02:22:54,490 --> 02:22:56,050
That's too bad.

2395
02:22:58,050 --> 02:22:59,250
And about the information.

2396
02:23:00,010 --> 02:23:10,330
the dog so i had some important information that you wanted
huh i think i feel like you could trust me even more because

2397
02:23:10,330 --> 02:23:23,190
i have no memory right levio saw that's right you called the
station yesterday and you asked to talk to me you told me

2398
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:32,490
you had an important lead on the case i was walking walk i
was working on important lead you said you you said you

2399
02:23:32,490 --> 02:23:42,750
wanted to meet me and talk to me directly tonight at the
junkyard important and you fell for it even given how fishy

2400
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:51,930
it sounds you're the last person i want to hear that from
you know but i just couldn't let it go no matter how shady

2401
02:23:51,930 --> 02:24:02,210
it seemed i'm walking here that's because i'm running out of
time Oh my god, are they gonna kill that guy in the jail?

2402
02:24:03,570 --> 02:24:04,150
Okay, that's right.

2403
02:24:04,370 --> 02:24:06,050
You said something was going down tonight.

2404
02:24:07,310 --> 02:24:08,110
Is he gonna die?

2405
02:24:08,730 --> 02:24:11,130
Does that something have to do with the case you're working
on?

2406
02:24:12,930 --> 02:24:14,990
I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it.

2407
02:24:15,170 --> 02:24:15,610
You stop!

2408
02:24:16,050 --> 02:24:17,450
Stop being so mysterious!

2409
02:24:19,330 --> 02:24:19,970
Oh boy.

2410
02:24:20,390 --> 02:24:21,510
But I guess I understand.

2411
02:24:22,410 --> 02:24:23,410
Death sentence, maybe.

2412
02:24:28,480 --> 02:24:29,420
Oh, wow.

2413
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:30,280
Okay.

2414
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:33,500
Let's stop dilly-dallying here.

2415
02:24:34,140 --> 02:24:35,540
So what are you going to do now?

2416
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:37,500
Bren, I guess.

2417
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:39,840
They'll catch me again if I don't get out of here.

2418
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:41,260
What is this accent?

2419
02:24:41,460 --> 02:24:42,560
I don't even know anymore.

2420
02:24:42,900 --> 02:24:44,100
And I have to get to the restaurant.

2421
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:45,840
I'm worried about Camilla.

2422
02:24:47,460 --> 02:24:48,720
Oh yeah, what was it?

2423
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:51,040
The chicken kitchen on Dead End Drive, right?

2424
02:24:53,580 --> 02:24:54,700
What about you, Sissel?

2425
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:55,880
What are you going to do?

2426
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:57,620
I'm going to follow you.

2427
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:01,300
I don't know to tell you the truth.

2428
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:04,500
You're my only lead.

2429
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:05,800
If you leave...

2430
02:25:06,940 --> 02:25:08,120
Yeah, feel guilty.

2431
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:08,860
Feel bad.

2432
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:10,620
I just saved your life three times.

2433
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:14,740
I just realized you and I are in the same boat.

2434
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:20,180
We're both looking for answers tonight, and neither one of
us has anybody to help us.

2435
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:22,640
Why do you have an accent again?

2436
02:25:23,420 --> 02:25:28,400
Hey, even if you can't cooperate with me, how about if we
just agree to use each other?

2437
02:25:29,100 --> 02:25:29,380
Oh!

2438
02:25:31,860 --> 02:25:33,360
That's not a bad idea.

2439
02:25:34,060 --> 02:25:34,700
You're on.

2440
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:39,000
But can I ask you to do a favor for me first?

2441
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:41,380
What's that?

2442
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:44,960
I need you to sneak into a certain place for me.

2443
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:47,040
A prison, to be exact.

2444
02:25:47,360 --> 02:25:48,480
The prison!

2445
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:51,000
Prison, prison, prison!

2446
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,540
That's the place I was calling from the office upstairs.

2447
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:59,220
I want you to go find out a certain prisoner's work schedule
for tomorrow.

2448
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:02,100
Uh-oh.

2449
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:03,620
I don't know.

2450
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:05,020
I don't like the sound of this.

2451
02:26:07,020 --> 02:26:07,440
Work schedule.

2452
02:26:07,660 --> 02:26:08,240
For a prisoner?

2453
02:26:09,300 --> 02:26:09,820
Yes.

2454
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:12,900
The prisoners are given different job details every day.

2455
02:26:13,580 --> 02:26:17,800
Each prisoner's schedule for the next day is written on a
small blackboard in his set.

2456
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:22,640
So just go check out a certain prisoner's blackboard, huh?

2457
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:23,360
Okay.

2458
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:29,360
His prisoner number is D99.

2459
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:33,260
Do.

2460
02:26:35,420 --> 02:26:38,060
If you do that for me, I'll cooperate with you.

2461
02:26:39,140 --> 02:26:40,320
Okay, you're on.

2462
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:41,900
Here.

2463
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:45,680
Let me give you the chicken kitchen's telephone number.

2464
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:47,380
All right.

2465
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:47,840
Easy.

2466
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:50,680
Chicken kitchen.

2467
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:55,940
Oh.

2468
02:26:56,860 --> 02:26:57,960
Where are we now?

2469
02:26:58,960 --> 02:26:59,880
Smell you later.

2470
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:01,500
See ya.

2471
02:27:02,480 --> 02:27:04,820
But don't die again, if you can help it.

2472
02:27:09,400 --> 02:27:10,800
Oh, we're in the sewer.

2473
02:27:11,180 --> 02:27:12,240
Oh, lamb!

2474
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:19,340
He's like, yippee!

2475
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:25,020
It looks like I hold the key to the case Lynn is
investigating.

2476
02:27:25,440 --> 02:27:27,700
And she holds the key to solving the mystery of me.

2477
02:27:28,260 --> 02:27:31,340
So we've started up a strange relationship of cooperation.

2478
02:27:33,560 --> 02:27:35,280
Lynn gave me an assignment.

2479
02:27:35,720 --> 02:27:39,340
My task is to go check out tomorrow's work schedule for
prisoner D-99.

2480
02:27:40,140 --> 02:27:41,480
I'd better get to the prison.

2481
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:46,500
Yippee, but un-grandpa boys.

2482
02:27:47,440 --> 02:27:49,920
I love this little contraption he has going on in here.

2483
02:27:50,060 --> 02:27:51,200
But what is he researching?

2484
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:52,980
It's the stuff with the rocks, right?

2485
02:27:54,020 --> 02:27:56,080
Hmm, there's so many, like, parts of this game.

2486
02:27:56,220 --> 02:27:57,920
I'm not really cooking much.

2487
02:27:58,300 --> 02:27:59,760
I don't really cook much in games.

2488
02:28:00,200 --> 02:28:01,780
I kind of just, like, like, to...

2489
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:06,860
to be surprised, you know.

2490
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:08,360
Oh, it's 9.03 p.m.

2491
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:10,880
Secret Seeker, welcome to membership.

2492
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:11,820
Thank you.

2493
02:28:14,300 --> 02:28:15,620
Yeah, just go with the flow.

2494
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:18,260
Lost memories of self.

2495
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:19,820
A forgotten murder case.

2496
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:24,380
A dead guy and a detective joined forces to find out the
truth behind them both.

2497
02:28:26,180 --> 02:28:27,880
Everything is so disjointed at the moment anyway.

2498
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:28,840
Yeah, true.

2499
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:32,260
The detective assigned the dead guy a task task.

2500
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:36,220
To sneak into the prison and find out a certain prisoner's
schedule for tomorrow.

2501
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:38,600
I like this music here.

2502
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:42,080
What should I care?

2503
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:43,060
What should I care?

2504
02:28:43,440 --> 02:28:44,660
I don't have a schedule for tomorrow.

2505
02:28:45,260 --> 02:28:46,880
That's how I'm feeling about it at the moment.

2506
02:28:51,450 --> 02:28:52,490
Trick time!

2507
02:28:53,270 --> 02:28:53,510
Oh.

2508
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:58,210
All right, let's get back to a phone here.

2509
02:28:59,650 --> 02:29:01,250
That's why this moves.

2510
02:29:02,430 --> 02:29:02,530
Sneaky.

2511
02:29:04,090 --> 02:29:07,310
Sneaky, sneaky.

2512
02:29:08,530 --> 02:29:08,650
Oh.

2513
02:29:10,410 --> 02:29:11,630
Our detective.

2514
02:29:13,990 --> 02:29:15,990
Oh my God.

2515
02:29:17,510 --> 02:29:18,790
It's all over.

2516
02:29:22,230 --> 02:29:23,550
It's all over.

2517
02:29:23,990 --> 02:29:25,570
It's all over for me.

2518
02:29:26,490 --> 02:29:26,510
Lynn.

2519
02:29:27,210 --> 02:29:29,790
Sweet, cute Lynn who shines as bright as the sun.

2520
02:29:30,870 --> 02:29:32,650
Ran away on me.

2521
02:29:33,710 --> 02:29:35,770
And then those detectives matching bookends.

2522
02:29:35,790 --> 02:29:48,330
blue and green yelled at me oh forget all about that now you
listen to me kid yes you are bright as the Sun Lynn probably

2523
02:29:48,330 --> 02:29:58,310
doesn't even know you exist oh my god wait no this is like
your your streamer doesn't even know you exist no

2524
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:10,920
one second and those detectives will probably yell at you
your whole life oh my God, getting true real.

2525
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:13,720
Never mind fretting about every little setback.

2526
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:14,960
Enjoy your life.

2527
02:30:15,320 --> 02:30:16,580
Get what you can out of it.

2528
02:30:17,820 --> 02:30:22,460
Mr. Would you mind just leaving me alone?

2529
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:23,760
Aw.

2530
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:26,460
Oh!

2531
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:27,460
Shoot.

2532
02:30:28,040 --> 02:30:28,380
Sorry.

2533
02:30:28,600 --> 02:30:31,340
I just put a toothpick, some chapstick.

2534
02:30:32,660 --> 02:30:39,020
But I thought it was emptier than it really was and just
splat all over my lips.

2535
02:30:43,400 --> 02:30:45,400
now it's all over my finger

2536
02:30:50,060 --> 02:30:59,340
my lips are going to be the most hydrated ever do we even
exist mint uh who are you just kidding uh who are you guys

2537
02:30:59,340 --> 02:31:02,600
mint doesn't even know who i am uh who are you

2538
02:31:06,210 --> 02:31:12,810
who are you she forgot about um All I'm thinking about is
Missile.

2539
02:31:13,630 --> 02:31:15,670
I want to know what's in that book so bad!

2540
02:31:18,110 --> 02:31:19,550
Time to go to the prison.

2541
02:31:21,830 --> 02:31:21,910
Oh.

2542
02:31:22,610 --> 02:31:24,090
Oh, we can go to the chicken kitchen.

2543
02:31:24,850 --> 02:31:26,650
No, but we have a job to do.

2544
02:31:26,950 --> 02:31:27,970
Uh, wait.

2545
02:31:28,970 --> 02:31:31,530
Oh, here, uniform and all, there we go.

2546
02:31:34,650 --> 02:31:37,030
Do you think Missile will be at the chicken kitchen?

2547
02:31:39,630 --> 02:31:40,710
Mint would never reach out.

2548
02:31:40,730 --> 02:31:52,250
this uh what did that say so how are the preparations coming
along i think they're taking care of them right now yeah man

2549
02:31:52,250 --> 02:32:00,890
i'm not looking forward to this that kind of surprises me
coming from you i didn't know you thought about such things

2550
02:32:00,890 --> 02:32:09,790
by the way that was me being sarcastic just in case you
didn't catch that check the apartment for missile no missile

2551
02:32:09,790 --> 02:32:14,630
left the apartment Missile busted down the door and bolted
away, didn't it?

2552
02:32:15,830 --> 02:32:16,770
Two more hours.

2553
02:32:17,870 --> 02:32:18,970
And then it's time.

2554
02:32:21,090 --> 02:32:24,650
Oh my god, we're gonna go check their jail cell and it's
gonna say nothing on their work.

2555
02:32:25,170 --> 02:32:28,110
Oh my god, it's gonna say works for tomorrow.

2556
02:32:28,770 --> 02:32:29,250
Death.

2557
02:32:29,910 --> 02:32:30,910
Oh my god!

2558
02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:37,200
I guess we should just get back to work.

2559
02:32:38,780 --> 02:32:40,060
Yeah, I guess you're right.

2560
02:32:42,100 --> 02:32:43,820
Oh my gosh, I don't want to do death tomorrow.

2561
02:32:47,500 --> 02:32:49,280
The atmosphere sure seems tense.

2562
02:32:51,400 --> 02:32:54,040
I guess I'll just get back to my work as well.

2563
02:32:55,640 --> 02:32:57,480
Find out a certain prisoner's work schedule for tomorrow.

2564
02:32:58,340 --> 02:32:58,760
Blah, blah, blah.

2565
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:01,740
Each prisoner's schedule for the next day is written on a
blackboard in a cell.

2566
02:33:02,700 --> 02:33:03,860
D99, everybody.

2567
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:05,200
Alrighty then.

2568
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:06,920
How do I get to these cells?

2569
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:09,840
I'd better try to get some information here first.

2570
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:12,000
Trick time!

2571
02:33:14,040 --> 02:33:22,180
have this memo and this memo and the monitors maybe now that
we know what's going on on the monitor we can check it tiny

2572
02:33:22,180 --> 02:33:37,510
rooms really small okay no we've read that before what's
this memo three oh no not let loose I like the way he holds

2573
02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:41,790
it what is it hey Bailey try

2574
02:33:45,080 --> 02:33:54,420
pinning up your memos a little better next time let me see
this thing inspection prisoner c74 well it's almost time for

2575
02:33:54,420 --> 02:34:05,880
that i'd better prepare prisoner c74 eh what did that big
whale do it dang i can't believe you can be thrown in jail

2576
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:13,860
for a gotcha addiction that's kind of messed up you don't
know about the metro police department

2577
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:22,980
C-74 barricaded himself into the Metro Police Department and
took siege of the place.

2578
02:34:23,620 --> 02:34:27,060
He even pointed a huge flamethrower at the Chief
Commissioner.

2579
02:34:27,440 --> 02:34:28,000
Damn!

2580
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:30,820
C-74!

2581
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:34,760
Why the heck did he do all that?

2582
02:34:36,820 --> 02:34:39,660
That's what the detectives who surrounded him asked, too.

2583
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:41,900
What are your demands, they asked.

2584
02:34:43,180 --> 02:34:43,560
And?

2585
02:34:43,860 --> 02:34:46,700
Oh my god, he said, More free poles!

2586
02:34:47,060 --> 02:34:49,640
The gotcha, the write-up is a lie!

2587
02:34:51,340 --> 02:34:56,760
The guy looked confused, thought about it for a while, and
said, Bring me five servings of curry and rice.

2588
02:34:57,140 --> 02:34:58,140
On the double!

2589
02:34:59,220 --> 02:35:00,180
Curry and rice?

2590
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:01,060
That's it?

2591
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:03,200
Unfortunately, no.

2592
02:35:03,660 --> 02:35:07,520
After he was done eating, he torched the commissioner's
office with the flamethrower.

2593
02:35:08,060 --> 02:35:09,020
Torched it good.

2594
02:35:09,860 --> 02:35:14,300
Important documents and the commissioner's mustache were
destroyed by the flames.

2595
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:16,020
Not the mustache!

2596
02:35:18,480 --> 02:35:18,960
Comrade!

2597
02:35:20,180 --> 02:35:21,660
What the heck did he do all that for?

2598
02:35:22,920 --> 02:35:25,220
Because the curry was too spicy, he said.

2599
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:29,980
The Fury's... This is the Fury's origin story.

2600
02:35:31,080 --> 02:35:33,540
It was too spicy and I just lost it, he said.

2601
02:35:37,340 --> 02:35:39,500
The case sent shockwaves throughout the country.

2602
02:35:40,580 --> 02:35:42,600
But it doesn't make any sense in the first place!

2603
02:35:43,380 --> 02:35:47,040
How did a huge armed guy make it all the way into the
commission?

2604
02:35:47,060 --> 02:35:59,380
office alone it's a complete mystery what why don't they
just ask c74 himself maybe they did but they didn't they

2605
02:35:59,380 --> 02:36:09,820
hadn't released anything about it with his huge arms
apparently it's all a matter of national secrecy hmm

2606
02:36:09,820 --> 02:36:18,060
interesting I Why did he do that?

2607
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,320
Why'd you quit throwing my important duty memos away?

2608
02:36:24,980 --> 02:36:25,380
Okay.

2609
02:36:30,770 --> 02:36:32,810
Is he gonna put another one up on the board?

2610
02:36:33,730 --> 02:36:34,990
Is this the same one as before?

2611
02:36:36,990 --> 02:36:43,770
I was hoping that I could possess the paper ball when he
threw it, so I could check the second monitor, but it won't

2612
02:36:43,770 --> 02:36:44,290
let me.

2613
02:36:45,970 --> 02:36:46,690
Hey, Bailey.

2614
02:36:47,850 --> 02:36:49,450
I think this guy has a southern accent.

2615
02:36:52,270 --> 02:36:53,110
What's the matter?

2616
02:36:53,410 --> 02:36:55,250
You can't even pin up a memo properly?

2617
02:36:55,970 --> 02:36:56,810
Let me see this thing.

2618
02:36:57,090 --> 02:36:59,670
Take prisoner C-38 to the telephone room.

2619
02:37:00,670 --> 02:37:03,230
Yes, he just made a request to use the phone a little while
ago.

2620
02:37:04,230 --> 02:37:05,750
You already told me that earlier.

2621
02:37:06,250 --> 02:37:07,330
C-38, eh?

2622
02:37:09,670 --> 02:37:11,610
You can move before you press the bubble.

2623
02:37:12,730 --> 02:37:13,290
Oh, I can?

2624
02:37:16,620 --> 02:37:20,620
In Japan, a death row's inmate execution date is not
revealed until the day of.

2625
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:22,940
I think that's why Lynn was asking his tomorrow the day.

2626
02:37:24,820 --> 02:37:27,360
I didn't know that, interesting.

2627
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:30,360
But, see, that's what I think.

2628
02:37:30,540 --> 02:37:31,640
He also was on Death Row.

2629
02:37:31,960 --> 02:37:32,640
I think so.

2630
02:37:33,620 --> 02:37:34,100
Oh.

2631
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:39,900
What did that punk do anyway?

2632
02:37:40,660 --> 02:37:44,200
You never heard the story about the secret rendezvous case.

2633
02:37:44,520 --> 02:37:45,180
Ooh, la la.

2634
02:37:46,300 --> 02:37:46,600
Secret.

2635
02:37:46,780 --> 02:37:47,080
Who, what?

2636
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:49,880
C38 was a singer and a band.

2637
02:37:50,500 --> 02:37:54,140
His group was playing a concert that was being broadcast all
over the country live.

2638
02:37:54,660 --> 02:37:55,200
And right in the middle.

2639
02:37:55,220 --> 02:38:05,320
of their encore there was a huge incident a huge incident
what was it a murder or something in a way it was even worse

2640
02:38:05,320 --> 02:38:13,880
than a murder because it had to do with national secrets oh
my gosh he said the launch codes in a song two five four

best part the best part the best part say that's the launch

2644
02:38:58,840 --> 02:39:16,840

take over the world yeah so I gave you the key everybody you

2645
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:29,220
just gotta go on lock the lock the song that they were doing
was called secret rendezvous but the The lyrics C38 was

2646
02:39:29,220 --> 02:39:31,160
singing were completely different from usual.

2647
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:35,640
So how is that a huge incident?

2648
02:39:35,820 --> 02:39:37,160
Oh my god, deep throat.

2649
02:39:38,200 --> 02:39:39,080
Because the new...

2650
02:39:39,080 --> 02:39:39,380
Oh, sorry.

2651
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:42,780
The new lyrics expose all the nation's dark...

2652
02:39:42,780 --> 02:39:44,480
Seamy secrets.

2653
02:39:45,080 --> 02:39:46,400
Does he mean steamy?

2654
02:39:47,620 --> 02:39:48,640
That was clever.

2655
02:39:50,140 --> 02:39:51,160
What, the launch code?

2656
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:51,540
Yeah.

2657
02:39:52,280 --> 02:39:54,420
The last part's a doozy, isn't it?

2658
02:39:55,660 --> 02:39:56,780
Budget misappropriations.

2659
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:00,640
strategies, elicit dealings, everything.

2660
02:40:02,520 --> 02:40:03,380
Seamy is a word?

2661
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:04,000
Oh, it is.

2662
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:08,100
First Mint blows the whistle on Boeing, then she reveals
launch codes.

2663
02:40:08,420 --> 02:40:09,440
She's a rebel.

2664
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:12,660
Mint played as like a damn fiddle.

2665
02:40:12,980 --> 02:40:14,060
What are you talking about?

2666
02:40:15,580 --> 02:40:19,300
He was caught red-handed in the act of leaking national
secrets.

2667
02:40:19,460 --> 02:40:21,000
You were so silly, Peter.

2668
02:40:22,060 --> 02:40:23,340
Thanks to the pink!

2669
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:25,280
Seriously?

2670
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:32,820
The case sent shockwaves throughout the country but it
doesn't make any sense in the first place how would a rock

2671
02:40:32,820 --> 02:40:40,240
singer know any top secret information it's a complete
mystery oh my gosh there's so many mysteries here oh my gosh

2672
02:40:41,540 --> 02:40:50,100
what why don't they just ask c38 himself maybe they did but
they haven't released anything about it apparently it's all

2673
02:40:50,100 --> 02:40:57,320
a matter of national secrecy okay she's gonna put up more
memos though right

2674
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:05,120
Would you quit throwing my important duty memos away?

2675
02:41:07,420 --> 02:41:08,440
Okay, Fushigir.

2676
02:41:09,280 --> 02:41:10,280
Okay, here's a new one.

2677
02:41:10,380 --> 02:41:10,920
Here's a new one.

2678
02:41:12,480 --> 02:41:12,980
Hello.

2679
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:24,620
Hey, Bailey.

2680
02:41:25,220 --> 02:41:27,740
Okay, here I can ghost.

2681
02:41:31,160 --> 02:41:34,840
Oh, I can operate the emergency switch.

2682
02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:39,680
Let me see this thing.

2683
02:41:40,320 --> 02:41:42,080
Bring dinner to prisoner D-99!

2684
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:44,780
Uh-oh.

2685
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:46,500
Is it his final meal?

2686
02:41:49,640 --> 02:41:51,860
The chief is preparing it for him right now.

2687
02:41:52,040 --> 02:41:53,280
Uh-oh, it's his final meal!

2688
02:41:54,060 --> 02:41:55,220
Ooh, how fancy.

2689
02:41:55,500 --> 02:41:56,960
That's why they're preparing it!

2690
02:41:57,820 --> 02:41:59,000
D-99, eh?

2691
02:41:59,300 --> 02:42:00,640
Even I know about this one.

2692
02:42:01,560 --> 02:42:01,880
Yeah?

2693
02:42:02,300 --> 02:42:03,520
Such a sad case.

2694
02:42:03,660 --> 02:42:04,580
Hard for us, too.

2695
02:42:06,460 --> 02:42:21,160
his wife didn't he right in front of a family member the
music it's just awful why in the world did he do it what

2696
02:42:21,160 --> 02:42:34,620
would be your final meal I don't remember what my final meal
was I don't know what I ate last before I died hmm maybe

2697
02:42:38,460 --> 02:42:46,040
why would he why would he do something like that of all
people the mode of everything all a complete god these

2698
02:42:46,040 --> 02:42:53,240
detectives suck they can't figure out anything everything's
a complete mystery it's just ridiculous it doesn't make

2699
02:42:53,240 --> 02:43:01,000
sense that you would do anything like that i don't know the
details but apparently this case is a matter of national

2700
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:10,480
secrecy as well i don't get it none of it makes any sense
You do know what kind of prison this is, don't you?

2701
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:12,000
No.

2702
02:43:13,140 --> 02:43:17,620
It's a special prison built for these kinds of special
cases.

2703
02:43:18,300 --> 02:43:23,980
That D-99, who knows what he's thinking or hiding behind
that beard of his.

2704
02:43:25,320 --> 02:43:27,200
I don't like any of it.

2705
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:30,740
I had my money on the exploding pies from SpongeBob.

2706
02:43:32,180 --> 02:43:35,680
I knew I couldn't take my job seriously without it getting
to me.

2707
02:43:36,520 --> 02:43:39,980
So the prisoner I'm looking for D-99 was convicted of
murder.

2708
02:43:42,300 --> 02:43:43,900
And he apparently has a beard.

2709
02:43:44,620 --> 02:43:45,280
Oh my god.

2710
02:43:46,700 --> 02:43:46,880
Ew.

2711
02:43:47,980 --> 02:43:48,320
Ow.

2712
02:43:51,140 --> 02:43:54,860
Would you quit throwing away my board duty memos?

2713
02:44:00,460 --> 02:44:01,320
All right.

2714
02:44:03,620 --> 02:44:04,340
It's time.

2715
02:44:07,320 --> 02:44:09,820
Wait, I've heard that sound before.

2716
02:44:10,860 --> 02:44:11,060
Up.

2717
02:44:12,220 --> 02:44:13,660
Oh, it's the rock star!

2718
02:44:15,180 --> 02:44:16,300
Oh my god!

2719
02:44:17,440 --> 02:44:20,920
Why did they allow him to have a guitar in prison?

2720
02:44:23,460 --> 02:44:24,640
It's a stock sound?

2721
02:44:24,980 --> 02:44:28,320
Okay, I'm like where have I heard that sound, that door
sound before?

2722
02:44:30,300 --> 02:44:31,900
Oh, he finished putting up a thing!

2723
02:44:33,080 --> 02:44:33,740
It's done!

2724
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:36,300
Emergency!

2725
02:44:37,860 --> 02:44:41,420
Oh, that's a lot of guns.

2726
02:44:41,500 --> 02:44:42,380
Oh my god.

2727
02:44:42,540 --> 02:44:43,820
Wait, is that like a...

2728
02:44:43,820 --> 02:44:45,220
Is that like a grenade launcher?

2729
02:44:45,720 --> 02:44:47,780
There you go again, fooling around with that thing!

2730
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:51,060
A bazooka?

2731
02:44:52,140 --> 02:44:53,480
It was in May.

2732
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:55,660
Don't lie, you...

2733
02:44:55,660 --> 02:44:58,260
Oh no, you love to see me jump and prepare for emergency.

2734
02:44:59,180 --> 02:45:00,200
Oh yeah, sure.

2735
02:45:00,400 --> 02:45:02,200
Way back when I first got this job.

2736
02:45:03,020 --> 02:45:04,480
But I've had enough of that now.

2737
02:45:04,660 --> 02:45:06,940
Besides, you always react exactly the same.

2738
02:45:08,100 --> 02:45:08,460
Girl!

2739
02:45:09,720 --> 02:45:11,480
The emergency switch is probably just...

2740
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:20,940
loose probably because I fooled around with it too much well
it's for emergencies don't play with it anyway it wasn't me

2741
02:45:20,940 --> 02:45:31,340
maybe you ought to get it repaired huh dang I'm back I'm so
sorry you guys for anyone watching the VOD um we just had a

2742
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:42,520
bit of a hiccup here we're back hopefully it is for good I
just I just stopped on the night vision goggles and I

2743
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:57,920
laughed about it and then and then OBS crashed it was it was
the night vision goggles is fall I was like I was like no

02:46:19,420 --> 02:46:26,160

2747
02:46:29,380 --> 02:46:41,100

2749
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:07,160

second ago am i still am i back you guys i can't tell

2750
02:47:08,380 --> 02:47:10,420
refresh if you're having having issues

2751
02:47:16,440 --> 02:47:20,140
i can't tell if i'm back i think my chat is dead hold on
screen

2752
02:47:24,940 --> 02:47:26,720
i think it's because uh

2753
02:47:30,940 --> 02:47:33,520
Oh, no, chat is all messed up on screen.

2754
02:47:34,440 --> 02:47:35,160
Oh, there it is.

2755
02:47:38,770 --> 02:47:47,370
I think OBS crashes when it, like, doesn't get a good
connection to YouTube.

2756
02:47:50,270 --> 02:47:52,230
You shouldn't have given us the launch codes.

2757
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:54,430
Yeah, you're so right.

2758
02:47:55,070 --> 02:47:58,110
I think maybe I jinxed myself by stopping my own stream
earlier.

2759
02:47:59,050 --> 02:48:01,430
I mean, I didn't do anything of this.

2760
02:48:02,490 --> 02:48:03,830
Wait, how long have I been streaming?

2761
02:48:03,970 --> 02:48:05,010
Okay, almost three hours.

2762
02:48:05,550 --> 02:48:06,410
I wanted to go longer.

2763
02:48:06,710 --> 02:48:08,490
I'm just nervous about...

2764
02:48:08,490 --> 02:48:10,250
Let's just go a little bit longer.

2765
02:48:11,530 --> 02:48:12,970
Because I wanted to play so much today.

2766
02:48:13,090 --> 02:48:14,450
I wanted to go longer today.

2767
02:48:15,890 --> 02:48:17,750
We'll see how if it acts up again.

2768
02:48:18,470 --> 02:48:21,410
But since it disconnected earlier, too, I'm just kind of
nervous.

2769
02:48:22,910 --> 02:48:25,870
I guess it's a way for this spiky-haired youth to express
himself.

2770
02:48:26,610 --> 02:48:27,910
Sentiments like, I'm hungry.

2771
02:48:28,190 --> 02:48:29,330
Or I'm thirsty, maybe.

2772
02:48:31,930 --> 02:48:32,850
Like that, I bet.

2773
02:48:36,860 --> 02:48:37,360
Peace out.

2774
02:48:38,460 --> 02:48:39,440
I'm done.

2775
02:48:42,020 --> 02:48:42,660
Turn up.

2776
02:48:42,900 --> 02:48:44,720
Hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop.

2777
02:48:44,740 --> 02:48:45,600
Hoop, hoop.

2778
02:48:45,660 --> 02:48:47,060
All right, C-38.

2779
02:48:47,360 --> 02:48:48,200
Back to yourself.

2780
02:48:49,500 --> 02:48:50,540
Hey, guard man.

2781
02:48:50,760 --> 02:48:52,500
How about giving me a little space?

2782
02:48:53,200 --> 02:48:55,820
That crazy walk of yours is doing...

2783
02:48:55,820 --> 02:48:57,380
Yours is dangerous, man.

2784
02:48:58,280 --> 02:48:58,820
Hoop, hoop.

2785
02:48:59,440 --> 02:49:01,440
A proper walk for a properly led life.

2786
02:49:01,800 --> 02:49:02,460
Now let's go.

2787
02:49:03,640 --> 02:49:05,300
Yo, no lectures, man.

2788
02:49:05,440 --> 02:49:06,600
I walk my own path.

2789
02:49:06,680 --> 02:49:08,380
My own way to my own music.

2790
02:49:10,080 --> 02:49:11,580
I'm going to blame the Patriots.

2791
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:12,720
Me too.

2792
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:19,580
And we're inside the guitar, so we get to go into the jail,
so...

2793
02:49:24,530 --> 02:49:25,470
Where's our beard?

2794
02:49:27,330 --> 02:49:28,590
Oh, that guy has a beard.

2795
02:49:30,230 --> 02:49:33,030
I can't tell if that guy has a beard.

2796
02:49:33,650 --> 02:49:35,450
So I finally made it to the cells.

2797
02:49:35,530 --> 02:49:39,470
Now to find Prisoner D99 and check out his work schedule for
tomorrow.

2798
02:49:40,150 --> 02:49:42,150
What could Lynn possibly want with that information?

2799
02:49:42,910 --> 02:49:44,010
This game is the GOAT!

2800
02:49:44,230 --> 02:49:45,670
Watching a blind playthrough is a lot of fun.

2801
02:49:45,810 --> 02:49:47,610
I wish I can re-experience it for the first time again.

2802
02:49:47,690 --> 02:49:48,410
Hope you enjoy!

2803
02:49:49,730 --> 02:49:50,410
Thank you!

2804
02:49:51,170 --> 02:49:52,410
I always feel that was...

2805
02:49:52,410 --> 02:49:54,450
Like, I of course feel that way with Metal Gear.

2806
02:49:55,850 --> 02:49:58,790
But it's like, at the same time, I'm so glad that I played
it.

2807
02:49:58,870 --> 02:50:02,490
If I had never played it, then I would never have
experienced it once to begin with.

2808
02:50:09,990 --> 02:50:17,670
Don't think I can take another second in this stinking pit
Dang, he has all his instruments and everything Looks like

2809
02:50:17,670 --> 02:50:18,830
the guard man is gone

2810
02:50:28,740 --> 02:50:32,960
All this weighting is wiping me out Hope this one will
finally do it

2811
02:50:36,220 --> 02:50:46,940
Oh Oh my god, he's sending the launch codes through Code
Come on, sausage head What?

2812
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:49,640
What?

2813
02:50:50,860 --> 02:50:52,060
This is a lenient prison.

2814
02:50:52,260 --> 02:50:55,200
For real, I was just thinking like they allow basketballs,
they allow...

2815
02:50:55,200 --> 02:50:58,240
Like, this guitar is so spiky it should be considered a
weapon.

2816
02:50:59,640 --> 02:51:01,600
This prisoner obviously isn't the one I'm looking for.

2817
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:03,720
Prisoner D-99 has a beard.

2818
02:51:04,400 --> 02:51:07,020
There's one of those little blackboards Lynn said would be
in the cells.

2819
02:51:07,660 --> 02:51:09,580
Maybe I should check out Spiky's schedule for tomorrow.

2820
02:51:12,260 --> 02:51:12,980
Yes, sir.

2821
02:51:13,500 --> 02:51:14,340
No, sir.

2822
02:51:14,920 --> 02:51:16,820
Ew, I can examine his toilet.

2823
02:51:18,280 --> 02:51:19,800
Let me just give it a little read.

2824
02:51:21,140 --> 02:51:22,880
Tonight, I lost a lot of things.

2825
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:24,020
My life, my memory.

2826
02:51:24,580 --> 02:51:26,520
But there's a certain skill I've apparently lost.

2827
02:51:26,900 --> 02:51:28,780
No, we don't know how to read!

2828
02:51:29,440 --> 02:51:31,020
I can't read!

2829
02:51:33,400 --> 02:51:34,900
Oh, God, I can't read!

2830
02:51:35,500 --> 02:51:36,960
Oh, God, I can't read!

2831
02:51:41,740 --> 02:51:45,870
I can see that there's some kind of...

2832
02:51:45,870 --> 02:51:48,250
But I have absolutely no idea what it means.

2833
02:51:48,450 --> 02:51:49,670
I can't read.

2834
02:51:51,430 --> 02:51:56,990
If I can't read Prisoner D-99's work schedule for tomorrow,
what do I do now?

2835
02:52:01,090 --> 02:52:01,650
What

2836
02:52:06,570 --> 02:52:07,410
is this?

2837
02:52:07,830 --> 02:52:08,490
Oh, this telephone.

2838
02:52:08,970 --> 02:52:10,330
Looks like it's an internal line only.

2839
02:52:10,850 --> 02:52:12,290
It doesn't call outside the prison.

2840
02:52:12,990 --> 02:52:18,070
So the only places I can go with this telephone are other
phones within the building that I've already possessed.

2841
02:52:18,250 --> 02:52:19,050
Oh, nice though.

2842
02:52:20,910 --> 02:52:22,970
Um, I can't read.

2843
02:52:23,970 --> 02:52:25,610
Oh my gosh, I can't read.

2844
02:52:25,670 --> 02:52:26,350
Oh.

2845
02:52:28,190 --> 02:52:28,830
Empty prison.

2846
02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:39,280
Looks like there's...

2847
02:52:39,280 --> 02:52:40,960
I cannot tell if the line going down...

2848
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:42,420
What if I just press the emergency button?

2849
02:52:43,840 --> 02:52:44,660
An emergency button.

2850
02:52:45,100 --> 02:52:45,580
An emergency.

2851
02:52:45,960 --> 02:52:46,440
In a prison.

2852
02:52:46,820 --> 02:52:48,180
That's gotta be a pretty bad situation.

2853
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:50,140
I'll give it a little try.

2854
02:52:50,600 --> 02:52:51,800
Time to cause chaos.

2855
02:52:57,840 --> 02:52:58,400
Uh-oh.

2856
02:52:58,520 --> 02:53:00,160
Oh, he just told him no, no, no.

2857
02:53:04,160 --> 02:53:06,680
Where do I go from here?

2858
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:12,460
I think I have to cause that and then go through the note,
maybe?

2859
02:53:14,260 --> 02:53:14,600
Hmm.

2860
02:53:25,510 --> 02:53:26,330
What is this?

2861
02:53:26,770 --> 02:53:27,650
Oh, I can play the drum.

2862
02:53:30,490 --> 02:53:31,690
Hey, quit that racket!

2863
02:53:33,590 --> 02:53:38,150
This music almost sounds like Pokemon, like, battle music,
doesn't it?

2864
02:53:39,130 --> 02:53:39,770
Oh, wait.

2865
02:53:39,910 --> 02:53:41,130
I think through here I can see.

2866
02:53:41,150 --> 02:53:41,570
see what's going.

2867
02:53:42,910 --> 02:53:44,030
It won't let me move around.

2868
02:53:44,650 --> 02:53:45,370
That's kind of weird.

2869
02:53:45,870 --> 02:53:47,850
It really lets me see what's going on on the screen.

2870
02:53:48,990 --> 02:53:51,530
But I'm trying to move and it won't let me move.

2871
02:53:57,630 --> 02:53:57,890
Oh!

2872
02:53:58,470 --> 02:53:59,490
They moved him!

2873
02:54:00,150 --> 02:54:00,450
Oh!

2874
02:54:00,910 --> 02:54:01,650
Wait a second.

2875
02:54:02,830 --> 02:54:03,670
Wait a second?

2876
02:54:06,410 --> 02:54:08,870
Oh, well, that's not our guy anyway, right?

2877
02:54:11,930 --> 02:54:13,950
Oh, and also this counts as a cutscene.

2878
02:54:15,010 --> 02:54:16,370
Go, go, go!

2879
02:54:23,980 --> 02:54:25,040
What's going on?

2880
02:54:27,900 --> 02:54:29,340
Does this count as a beard?

2881
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:32,180
This guy has a beard?

2882
02:54:33,020 --> 02:54:34,160
Both of them have a beard.

2883
02:54:36,460 --> 02:54:37,960
Why is this guy a baby?

2884
02:54:38,100 --> 02:54:39,520
Why does this guy have...

2885
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:41,140
The large... What is this guy?

2886
02:54:46,270 --> 02:54:46,710
Oh!

2887
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:57,600
His head is so wobbly.

2888
02:54:58,180 --> 02:54:58,800
I don't think I...

2889
02:54:59,740 --> 02:55:00,820
Oh my god!

2890
02:55:01,480 --> 02:55:02,280
Prison break!

2891
02:55:09,210 --> 02:55:12,670
This guy was accidentally attached to the thing, and I
didn't realize.

2892
02:55:13,450 --> 02:55:17,450
By the looks of him, that must be the curry lover from the
police department's siege case.

2893
02:55:17,870 --> 02:55:19,570
But never mind that, where did he go?

2894
02:55:20,330 --> 02:55:22,070
What is going on in this cell?

2895
02:55:22,490 --> 02:55:24,570
There's a little blackboard here, too.

2896
02:55:25,590 --> 02:55:29,210
Just to be safe, maybe I'd better check the curry lover's
schedule for tomorrow, too.

2897
02:55:29,930 --> 02:55:31,290
But I can't read.

2898
02:55:35,470 --> 02:55:37,070
You solved it by accident?

2899
02:55:37,210 --> 02:55:45,530
Well, I knew what I had to do, but I didn't realize I was,
um, I didn't realize I was, uh, uh, possessing the, the,

2900
02:55:45,530 --> 02:55:46,470
the, the note.

2901
02:55:47,850 --> 02:55:49,330
I still can't read.

2902
02:55:49,730 --> 02:55:52,310
But I better go check out Prisoner D99 cell anyway.

2903
02:55:52,730 --> 02:55:55,250
Maybe I can find some kind of information that might help
Lynn out.

2904
02:55:55,870 --> 02:55:59,510
Besides, I want to see what this Prisoner Lynn is
investigating looks like.

2905
02:56:02,510 --> 02:56:04,250
Oh, I can't get over there.

2906
02:56:04,370 --> 02:56:04,730
Uh-oh.

2907
02:56:06,810 --> 02:56:07,770
Uh-oh.

2908
02:56:07,770 --> 02:56:08,250
Ringling!

2909
02:56:08,970 --> 02:56:10,070
Come back, mister.

2910
02:56:12,550 --> 02:56:13,750
Come back, come back.

2911
02:56:17,850 --> 02:56:18,810
His spoon.

2912
02:56:20,010 --> 02:56:20,310
Phew!

2913
02:56:20,810 --> 02:56:21,530
Oh, nice.

2914
02:56:21,670 --> 02:56:22,230
Thank you, sir.

2915
02:56:28,120 --> 02:56:29,300
Same thing here.

2916
02:56:31,240 --> 02:56:32,540
It doesn't call outside.

2917
02:56:33,820 --> 02:56:35,600
Other phones within the building that I've already
possessed.

2918
02:56:35,720 --> 02:56:36,600
Well, we've possessed this one.

2919
02:56:36,620 --> 02:56:55,710
one now so we're good okay here we are oh he's an artist oh
hmm with a what is that on the wall what a strange cell and

2920
02:56:55,710 --> 02:57:05,390
the prisoner inside it he seems to be enjoying himself sorry
i'm invading your private time this is the last cell in this

2921
02:57:05,390 --> 02:57:18,050
area so that means that this himself must be prisoner d99
according to what the guards say oh yeah recap he shot his

2922
02:57:18,050 --> 02:57:30,130
wife in front of a family member what in the world really
happened hmm and why is Lynn so concerned about this

2923
02:57:30,130 --> 02:57:40,710
prisoner I don't know the answers and I guess there's no
need for me to know I have only one of Objective.

2924
02:57:42,030 --> 02:57:45,770
And that's to find out what this painter's work schedule is
for tomorrow.

2925
02:57:50,620 --> 02:57:51,660
Trick time!

2926
02:57:53,780 --> 02:57:54,820
Picture frame.

2927
02:57:55,020 --> 02:57:55,920
Okay, open that up.

2928
02:57:59,080 --> 02:57:59,520
What's it?

2929
02:57:59,880 --> 02:58:02,180
I wonder if these are his family.

2930
02:58:02,400 --> 02:58:03,780
Oh my gosh, that's kind of gruesome, though.

2931
02:58:04,240 --> 02:58:04,740
Oh my god.

2932
02:58:05,300 --> 02:58:07,320
It's my wife and a giraffe!

2933
02:58:08,440 --> 02:58:09,160
My children!

2934
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:11,220
My child is a giraffe!

2935
02:58:12,560 --> 02:58:14,860
Why is the left picture a giraffe?

2936
02:58:17,880 --> 02:58:19,260
Oh my god.

2937
02:58:21,720 --> 02:58:23,220
I wonder if these are of his family.

2938
02:58:23,860 --> 02:58:26,260
This one looks like a young woman holding a baby.

2939
02:58:28,460 --> 02:58:28,560
Oh!

2940
02:58:57,030 --> 02:58:59,210
You guys see the giraffe?

2941
02:59:00,010 --> 02:59:02,270
You guys see the giraffe right?

2942
02:59:06,090 --> 02:59:07,330
Oh, I know.

2943
02:59:08,870 --> 02:59:10,090
Oh, I could see it?

2944
02:59:13,670 --> 02:59:14,150
Oh.

2945
02:59:15,550 --> 02:59:18,750
Their faces have been blotted out with black paint.

2946
02:59:19,610 --> 02:59:21,990
Oh, so the baby is definitely Lynn, right?

2947
02:59:22,670 --> 02:59:25,090
Did he do it out of hatred or some other emotion?

2948
02:59:26,050 --> 02:59:28,270
Thankfully, that's not something I need to know right now.

2949
02:59:29,430 --> 02:59:33,750
She definitely became a detective to figure out her dad's
situation.

2950
02:59:36,770 --> 02:59:38,850
A newspaper article has been cut out in frame.

2951
02:59:41,610 --> 02:59:43,390
Unfortunately, I can't read it.

2952
02:59:44,210 --> 02:59:45,150
I'm stupid!

2953
02:59:45,450 --> 02:59:45,910
I'm dumb!

2954
02:59:46,210 --> 02:59:46,910
I'm so dumb!

2955
02:59:47,370 --> 02:59:49,030
It's probably about D99's case.

2956
02:59:49,270 --> 02:59:51,090
Man, murder his wife or something like that.

2957
02:59:51,530 --> 02:59:52,990
Why would you frame that, though?

2958
02:59:53,950 --> 02:59:56,070
There's a picture of the alleged culprit in the article.

2959
02:59:56,890 --> 02:59:58,630
Yep, it's this prisoner, alright.

2960
03:00:04,680 --> 03:00:05,920
Okay, moment of truth.

2961
03:00:06,120 --> 03:00:09,220
The work schedule for tomorrow of prisoner D99.

2962
03:00:09,820 --> 03:00:10,440
It's gonna be...

2963
03:00:10,440 --> 03:00:14,640
Okay, the reason we don't need to know how to read is
because it's going to be empty.

2964
03:00:15,220 --> 03:00:15,800
Oh my gosh.

2965
03:00:17,200 --> 03:00:18,140
We don't need to know.

2966
03:00:18,400 --> 03:00:19,260
It's going to be empty.

2967
03:00:19,520 --> 03:00:20,260
Oh my gosh.

2968
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:20,840
Oh my gosh.

2969
03:00:20,920 --> 03:00:21,860
It's going to be empty.

2970
03:00:23,460 --> 03:00:23,500
Oh.

2971
03:00:24,840 --> 03:00:27,840
The information Lynn's been looking for should be written on
this blackboard.

2972
03:00:28,700 --> 03:00:30,480
Unfortunately, I've lost the ability to read.

2973
03:00:31,640 --> 03:00:32,500
But here I am anyway.

2974
03:00:32,820 --> 03:00:34,160
The least I can do is take a look.

2975
03:00:37,060 --> 03:00:37,260
Huh?

2976
03:00:37,840 --> 03:00:38,920
What could this mean?

2977
03:00:40,440 --> 03:00:42,380
There's nothing written on the board!

2978
03:00:42,660 --> 03:00:43,440
Oh no!

2979
03:00:45,160 --> 03:00:46,740
Oh my god.

2980
03:00:47,340 --> 03:00:48,340
No work tomorrow!

2981
03:00:48,560 --> 03:00:50,340
Oh gosh, he has death tomorrow!

2982
03:00:51,340 --> 03:00:53,160
I think something was written on the blackboard.

2983
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:56,800
I think something was written on the blackboards of the
other prisoners.

2984
03:00:57,500 --> 03:01:01,820
But this blackboard is as clean and blank as the day it was
hung there.

2985
03:01:03,360 --> 03:01:04,440
I knew it.

2986
03:01:04,560 --> 03:01:05,780
I knew it.

2987
03:01:07,580 --> 03:01:09,480
So I have the answer Lin was looking for.

2988
03:01:10,440 --> 03:01:21,640
work schedule for prisoner d99 is nothing oh would this
information mean anything to her it's not up to me to know

2989
03:01:21,640 --> 03:01:34,100
or care that's how i feel at the moment anyway oh and then
they're cooking his final meal i'm jealous oh my gosh mister

2990
03:01:34,100 --> 03:01:40,620
not being able to read i was wondering how this was going to
turn out some things in this world can be read even if one

2991
03:01:40,620 --> 03:01:51,800
can read can't oh even if one can't read no one can read
prisoner d99's work schedule for tomorrow is blank i'd

2992
03:01:51,800 --> 03:01:54,160
better get this important information to lynn as fast as i
can

2993
03:01:57,420 --> 03:02:05,550
uh close oh dinner

2994
03:02:08,840 --> 03:02:26,520
quite a feast tonight i see whoa he's huge he's the he's the
literal chat meme my gosh this guy is the Chad meme he's a

2995
03:02:26,520 --> 03:02:39,380
huge he cuts out of the frame and I'm absolutely crazy about
this chicken oh he's smiling it's too bad it's all cold and

2996
03:02:39,380 --> 03:02:45,880
hard though I'd say it's been about two hours since it was
cooked judging from the way it feels.

2997
03:02:48,100 --> 03:02:48,700
D99?

2998
03:02:49,820 --> 03:02:51,840
I know it's kind of pointless to ask now.

2999
03:02:52,860 --> 03:02:53,520
But just the same.

3000
03:02:54,960 --> 03:02:55,880
I still want to know.

3001
03:02:57,120 --> 03:02:58,640
Why did you do it?

3002
03:03:03,510 --> 03:03:04,510
I agree.

3003
03:03:05,210 --> 03:03:06,810
It's pointless to ask now.

3004
03:03:09,150 --> 03:03:13,510
My case is colder than this chicken and has been forgotten
by everybody.

3005
03:03:15,570 --> 03:03:16,570
Myself included.

3006
03:03:19,310 --> 03:03:20,270
Detective Chao!

3007
03:03:20,590 --> 03:03:21,730
He was a detective!

3008
03:03:23,410 --> 03:03:27,010
Now then, let me eat in peace before it gets too cold to
cut.

3009
03:03:28,730 --> 03:03:30,890
Why did they take so long to serve him as dinner?

3010
03:03:36,660 --> 03:03:38,420
Oh, that is art.

3011
03:03:39,280 --> 03:03:41,740
There's one more thing I've been wondering for a long time.

3012
03:03:44,120 --> 03:03:44,720
What's that?

3013
03:03:44,880 --> 03:03:45,700
Is it about Lin?

3014
03:03:46,420 --> 03:03:47,040
Your daughter?

3015
03:03:47,380 --> 03:03:49,420
Oh, who was the man in that painting?

3016
03:03:52,340 --> 03:03:53,320
Oh, this?

3017
03:03:53,940 --> 03:03:54,840
It's the culprit.

3018
03:03:57,040 --> 03:04:00,300
Well, being in prison like this, you start to forget faces,
you know?

3019
03:04:01,200 --> 03:04:03,900
So I paint the faces that I don't want to forget.

3020
03:04:05,820 --> 03:04:08,300
And this is the last of those faces.

3021
03:04:15,380 --> 03:04:17,820
Could you leave me alone for a bit?

3022
03:04:18,580 --> 03:04:18,960
Wait!

3023
03:04:21,400 --> 03:04:21,880
What?

3024
03:04:26,160 --> 03:04:29,040
Let a man eat in peace.

3025
03:04:30,980 --> 03:04:31,360
Okay, sure.

3026
03:04:31,980 --> 03:04:32,750
Sorry to bother you.

3027
03:04:34,060 --> 03:04:34,690
We must have...

3028
03:04:35,400 --> 03:04:36,540
Did we work together?

3029
03:04:36,900 --> 03:04:37,620
What's going on?

3030
03:04:37,700 --> 03:04:37,940
Wait.

3031
03:04:38,720 --> 03:04:40,240
Our hair is so similar.

3032
03:04:40,820 --> 03:04:41,380
I don't know.

3033
03:04:41,520 --> 03:04:42,200
Are we brothers?

3034
03:04:42,960 --> 03:04:44,300
What's going on?

3035
03:04:49,740 --> 03:04:50,360
Partners.

3036
03:04:51,100 --> 03:04:53,000
Yeah, like, were we detective partners?

3037
03:04:53,640 --> 03:04:54,260
Were we...

3038
03:04:54,340 --> 03:04:55,440
Were we...

3039
03:04:55,440 --> 03:04:59,740
I don't think we were detective partners, though, because
they would have known we were detectives together.

3040
03:05:00,100 --> 03:05:00,620
I don't know.

3041
03:05:00,740 --> 03:05:01,720
I think we were brothers!

3042
03:05:02,580 --> 03:05:03,940
What in the world?

3043
03:05:04,580 --> 03:05:06,100
What in the world could this mean?

3044
03:05:06,760 --> 03:05:09,560
Why is there a painting of me in this man's cell?

3045
03:05:13,100 --> 03:05:14,500
Oh, my God.

3046
03:05:14,620 --> 03:05:16,040
Who exactly is this prisoner?

3047
03:05:16,420 --> 03:05:20,560
The man whose case Lynn is investigating is painting a
picture of me in his cell.

3048
03:05:21,620 --> 03:05:22,780
If only he could read.

3049
03:05:24,340 --> 03:05:29,690
to go see lynn fast not for her sake for mine to solve this
mystery of me

3050
03:05:35,500 --> 03:05:40,020

3051
03:06:14,960 --> 03:06:25,840
that's me all right we know we can get to her by going
through the phone doesn't connect to the outside and I've

3052
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:31,980
got questions I want to ask Lynn yeah we go to the office
gotta get to a place that has an external line and fast yeah

3053
03:06:31,980 --> 03:06:35,080
yeah I know I know the guard room

3054
03:06:43,430 --> 03:06:54,750

3056
03:06:59,810 --> 03:07:01,530
One more hour, sir.

3057
03:07:02,390 --> 03:07:02,830
I see.

3058
03:07:03,230 --> 03:07:03,800
Can't really...

3059
03:07:04,310 --> 03:07:05,170
One more hour?

3060
03:07:05,950 --> 03:07:07,750
Oh, one more thing.

3061
03:07:08,110 --> 03:07:08,970
What is it, Columbo?

3062
03:07:09,790 --> 03:07:12,330
Inspector Cabanella wishes to speak to you.

3063
03:07:14,300 --> 03:07:18,650
I think Cabanella is the guy who's done everything.

3064
03:07:19,350 --> 03:07:20,110
I think it's him.

3065
03:07:20,830 --> 03:07:22,490
I think he's going to do a switch on us.

3066
03:07:23,250 --> 03:07:24,630
Evening, Cabanella here.

3067
03:07:24,950 --> 03:07:26,010
How are your boys doing?

3068
03:07:27,150 --> 03:07:27,710
Hubba.

3069
03:07:28,570 --> 03:07:29,890
Inspector Cabanella, fine, sir.

3070
03:07:31,470 --> 03:07:33,410
You got another little call tonight, didn't you?

3071
03:07:33,670 --> 03:07:34,430
From my baby.

3072
03:07:36,670 --> 03:07:36,990
Oh.

3073
03:07:37,810 --> 03:07:38,650
From Lynn?

3074
03:07:39,030 --> 03:07:40,290
Uh, well, yes?

3075
03:07:40,410 --> 03:07:40,890
No!

3076
03:07:41,990 --> 03:07:42,550
Bailey!

3077
03:07:42,790 --> 03:07:44,510
You weren't supposed to snitch!

3078
03:07:45,510 --> 03:07:47,230
Chief has his dogs out.

3079
03:07:47,990 --> 03:07:48,670
What do you mean?

3080
03:07:49,530 --> 03:07:51,210
Do my girl have anything?

3081
03:07:51,850 --> 03:07:53,010
Interesting to say.

3082
03:07:54,250 --> 03:07:55,470
Uh, not especially.

3083
03:07:55,790 --> 03:07:56,970
She hung up almost immediately.

3084
03:07:57,850 --> 03:07:58,970
I see.

3085
03:08:01,530 --> 03:08:04,610
Next time she gives you a buzz, be sure to let me know right
away.

3086
03:08:05,270 --> 03:08:06,550
That's a good fellow.

3087
03:08:07,890 --> 03:08:08,650
Yes, sir.

3088
03:08:10,810 --> 03:08:14,350
You try to cover it up and I'm sure you'll regret it very
much.

3089
03:08:14,970 --> 03:08:15,990
Very much.

3090
03:08:16,430 --> 03:08:17,690
Thank you very much.

3091
03:08:18,630 --> 03:08:19,490
Yes, sir.

3092
03:08:19,750 --> 03:08:20,750
I'll call you right away, sir.

3093
03:08:21,230 --> 03:08:21,570
Immediately.

3094
03:08:23,270 --> 03:08:26,910
I can kind of see, I can catch glimpses of his feet.

3095
03:08:27,610 --> 03:08:38,850
don't forget she's a fugitive after all yes sir carry on
then I might pop in a little later yes sir looking forward

3096
03:08:38,850 --> 03:08:48,770
to seeing you sir oh my god his feet yeah his shoes are off

3097
03:08:53,370 --> 03:09:00,150
inspector Cabanella seems to be looking for her too you're
Lynn I mean Inspector Cabanel.

3098
03:09:00,810 --> 03:09:03,230
What would that special investigation unit want with Lynn?

3099
03:09:04,810 --> 03:09:05,250
I don't know.

3100
03:09:05,530 --> 03:09:08,290
I guess something happened that we don't know about.

3101
03:09:11,130 --> 03:09:12,790
Tonight, of all nots.

3102
03:09:13,870 --> 03:09:14,170
Damn.

3103
03:09:15,370 --> 03:09:16,430
He really is barefoot.

3104
03:09:16,630 --> 03:09:17,950
Let's put it on the feet, Wiki.

3105
03:09:18,670 --> 03:09:19,110
No!

3106
03:09:19,670 --> 03:09:21,710
Do you guys mind if I grab some more water real quick?

3107
03:09:21,810 --> 03:09:22,750
I drank all my coffee.

3108
03:09:23,050 --> 03:09:24,650
I just want some hot water for my throat.

3109
03:09:25,210 --> 03:09:27,230
And I'm going to get a little snack.

3110
03:09:27,750 --> 03:09:28,850
But it'll be fast.

03:12:48,050 --> 03:12:48,790
We're good.

3121
03:12:49,370 --> 03:12:52,210
She really said, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

3122
03:12:53,950 --> 03:12:57,170
Sometimes, I know it's, uh, I know it's, like, with Merrill.

3123
03:12:57,990 --> 03:13:00,930
But sometimes I like to be like, You said you'd be a good
girl.

3124
03:13:02,970 --> 03:13:06,050
I, um, how's it?

3125
03:13:09,110 --> 03:13:11,250
Inspector Cabanela must be upset tonight, too.

3126
03:13:13,010 --> 03:13:13,670
Mmm!

3127
03:13:16,630 --> 03:13:18,090
Weren't he in Prisoner D99?

3128
03:13:18,510 --> 03:13:19,330
Detective Jowd?

3129
03:13:19,470 --> 03:13:20,110
Good friends?

3130
03:13:20,670 --> 03:13:21,250
Oh, oh.

3131
03:13:22,170 --> 03:13:23,770
Cabanella definitely did it then.

3132
03:13:24,770 --> 03:13:25,890
He was jealous of something.

3133
03:13:27,010 --> 03:13:30,550
He was jealous of the wife who he...

3134
03:13:32,870 --> 03:13:35,030
That's why he calls Lin his baby.

3135
03:13:40,120 --> 03:13:40,700
I think.

3136
03:13:43,320 --> 03:13:43,980
Oh, I think.

3137
03:13:45,460 --> 03:13:46,640
Are you sure about that?

3138
03:13:47,280 --> 03:13:48,260
They were such good friends.

3139
03:13:49,140 --> 03:13:51,560
How come Inspector Cabanella never came to visit him?

3140
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:57,060
He's a head of a special investigation.

3141
03:13:57,560 --> 03:13:58,660
He's a very busy man.

3142
03:14:01,700 --> 03:14:03,520
You couldn't be that stylish and a bad guy.

3143
03:14:04,560 --> 03:14:04,960
Oh, no.

3144
03:14:05,560 --> 03:14:06,400
What's wrong?

3145
03:14:07,220 --> 03:14:08,540
Jowd was my hero, you know.

3146
03:14:08,880 --> 03:14:10,580
I wanted to be a detective because of him.

3147
03:14:11,420 --> 03:14:12,180
But look at me.

3148
03:14:12,600 --> 03:14:13,780
Rotting away in a place.

3149
03:14:13,820 --> 03:14:15,040
Oh, rotten away in a place.

3150
03:14:15,460 --> 03:14:17,120
This guy does have a southern accent.

3151
03:14:18,740 --> 03:14:20,520
Grouting away in a place like this.

3152
03:14:21,360 --> 03:14:22,720
Wait, how do I do a southern accent?

3153
03:14:23,200 --> 03:14:25,420
And I can't even do anything to help Lynn.

3154
03:14:26,240 --> 03:14:27,680
What am I doing with my life?

3155
03:14:29,840 --> 03:14:32,940
This new side of you is kind of endearing.

3156
03:14:33,260 --> 03:14:33,880
Oh my gosh.

3157
03:14:34,460 --> 03:14:35,680
Are you developing a crush?

3158
03:14:37,980 --> 03:14:40,960
Anyway, the thing to do is work at fixing what you can.

3159
03:14:41,280 --> 03:14:42,000
Little by little.

3160
03:14:42,860 --> 03:14:44,840
Like, for example, your house of cards.

3161
03:14:45,460 --> 03:14:46,330
Collapsed, you know.

3162
03:14:48,660 --> 03:14:50,300
Can love Blue.

3163
03:14:51,860 --> 03:14:53,900
Even in the prison office.

3164
03:14:58,440 --> 03:15:00,050
Lynn should be heading for the chicken kitchen now.

3165
03:15:01,680 --> 03:15:03,980
Call from the police headquarters intrigues me, too.

3166
03:15:08,280 --> 03:15:09,900
It's looking pretty obvious right now.

3167
03:15:10,100 --> 03:15:12,120
That white-suited inspector suspects Lynn.

3168
03:15:12,820 --> 03:15:14,240
And she's being considered a fugitive.

3169
03:15:14,600 --> 03:15:15,380
This is not good.

3170
03:15:17,400 --> 03:15:24,700
should go check in on the chief and the inspector in white
too uh i think we should get the information to her first

3171
03:15:24,700 --> 03:15:36,240
right oh wait dial dial dial dial uh external line oh my
gosh we're getting so many places now is lynn the only woman

3172
03:15:36,240 --> 03:15:43,540
in this world i know right i think she's the oh no besides
the the roommate she is the only other girl we've met i

3173
03:15:43,540 --> 03:15:48,360
think right oh oh and the mom that That fancy lady.

3174
03:15:51,960 --> 03:15:53,240
The chicken kitchen.

3175
03:15:55,820 --> 03:15:58,080
This is where that little lady and Lynn are supposed to
meet.

3176
03:15:59,180 --> 03:15:59,340
But.

3177
03:16:02,970 --> 03:16:04,730
I don't see either one of them here.

3178
03:16:05,830 --> 03:16:06,650
Yeah, and her daughter.

3179
03:16:06,790 --> 03:16:07,610
So, so true, so true.

3180
03:16:08,510 --> 03:16:09,630
Guess they haven't shown up yet.

3181
03:16:10,250 --> 03:16:11,390
It's been so much time.

3182
03:16:11,450 --> 03:16:12,730
What do you mean they haven't shown up?

3183
03:16:13,650 --> 03:16:15,030
This music is so funky.

3184
03:16:19,270 --> 03:16:20,290
There's someone singing.

3185
03:16:20,710 --> 03:16:21,890
In my right ear.

3186
03:16:36,360 --> 03:16:38,140
Sorry, I'll quiet it down.

3187
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:40,800
Yeah, pipe down there, Mr.

3188
03:16:47,340 --> 03:16:49,680
I would like some service.

3189
03:16:52,960 --> 03:16:53,260
Alright.

3190
03:16:54,020 --> 03:16:56,920
I guess we have to go to the other place before.

3191
03:16:58,300 --> 03:16:59,900
They're forcing me.

3192
03:17:00,200 --> 03:17:02,040
They're forcing me to go to here.

3193
03:17:02,980 --> 03:17:05,820
Before we can experience chicken diners.

3194
03:17:07,560 --> 03:17:08,680
Fine chicken dining.

3195
03:17:10,020 --> 03:17:10,440
Mm-hmm.

3196
03:17:14,010 --> 03:17:15,210
In the long.

3197
03:17:18,190 --> 03:17:19,250
Oh, his toes!

3198
03:17:21,650 --> 03:17:23,970
Preparation seemed to be going smoothly over at the prison.

3199
03:17:24,310 --> 03:17:24,470
A.

3200
03:17:24,630 --> 03:17:25,430
Inspector Cabanella.

3201
03:17:28,850 --> 03:17:30,410
We were just a little too late.

3202
03:17:30,750 --> 03:17:31,910
So close, eh, Inspector?

3203
03:17:35,510 --> 03:17:38,490
We still have a little time left, Chief.

3204
03:17:38,850 --> 03:17:39,710
Not much, but some.

3205
03:17:41,390 --> 03:17:43,510
We've had point X around it all night.

3206
03:17:44,630 --> 03:17:47,870
If he shows up, we nab him, and we can still make it.

3207
03:17:50,610 --> 03:17:53,590
If he shows up, the real murderer of the wife?

3208
03:17:55,770 --> 03:17:58,610
But then why would you even tell that guy that he's going to
die?

3209
03:18:00,710 --> 03:18:14,240
tomorrow unless he has nothing on his board because he's
getting away free they're letting him out by the way what's

3210
03:18:14,240 --> 03:18:27,820
going on with that other case the junkyard murder she did it
eh no question about it I don't want to

3211
03:18:31,210 --> 03:18:35,750
read she's been a bad little baby Disappeared from the scene
like that.

3212
03:18:36,210 --> 03:18:37,690
Wonder where she ran off to play.

3213
03:18:38,570 --> 03:18:39,050
No!

3214
03:18:40,530 --> 03:18:41,710
What did he just say?

3215
03:18:42,130 --> 03:18:42,990
She did it.

3216
03:18:43,270 --> 03:18:44,170
Did I hear that right?

3217
03:18:44,810 --> 03:18:46,790
I think they were talking about the culprit who killed me.

3218
03:18:48,130 --> 03:18:48,810
No way.

3219
03:18:50,810 --> 03:18:51,770
No way!

3220
03:18:56,220 --> 03:18:57,060
Trick time.

3221
03:18:57,680 --> 03:18:58,940
Can I possess his feet?

3222
03:18:59,360 --> 03:18:59,980
Good lord.

3223
03:19:03,640 --> 03:19:04,540
What is this?

3224
03:19:04,780 --> 03:19:05,080
Ooh!

3225
03:19:08,100 --> 03:19:09,600
I just don't believe it.

3226
03:19:09,940 --> 03:19:11,340
Why would she do a thing like that?

3227
03:19:12,280 --> 03:19:14,100
Afraid I don't have the answers for you, Chief.

3228
03:19:14,640 --> 03:19:17,270
I don't want to believe it any more than you do.

3229
03:19:19,780 --> 03:19:20,620
And yet...

3230
03:19:20,620 --> 03:19:21,860
Stream had a hiccup again?

3231
03:19:30,640 --> 03:19:31,060
Hmm...

3232
03:19:31,060 --> 03:19:32,520
I wonder why there's so many issues tonight.

3233
03:19:33,380 --> 03:19:34,080
Oh, no hiccup here?

3234
03:19:44,890 --> 03:19:48,370
After seeing this, maybe we don't have any other choice but
to believe, baby.

3235
03:19:50,310 --> 03:19:51,030
Set the security.

3236
03:19:51,050 --> 03:19:59,210
security camera tape the investigation unit just delivered I
can't deny it's some pretty solid evidence against her watch

3237
03:19:59,210 --> 03:20:06,190
the tape is going to be this is some actual Phoenix Wright
shit where the the tape will be like them standing each

3238
03:20:06,190 --> 03:20:14,710
other talking and then it cuts out and then she's like
holding his body because the actual murder part gets gets uh

3239
03:20:14,710 --> 03:20:16,450
gets deleted somehow

3240
03:20:33,440 --> 03:20:34,920
Nothing like it, baby.

3241
03:20:41,280 --> 03:20:42,860
It's okay, they're just fries.

3242
03:20:43,100 --> 03:20:44,180
I can eat them with my fingies.

3243
03:20:44,340 --> 03:20:46,160
I was just trying to avoid greasy hands.

3244
03:20:47,460 --> 03:20:49,540
Why a murder case now on such an important night?

3245
03:20:51,740 --> 03:20:53,740
Put your feet, I mean, put your...

3246
03:20:53,740 --> 03:20:55,400
Put your shoes on, man.

3247
03:20:55,660 --> 03:20:56,300
Come on.

3248
03:20:56,820 --> 03:20:58,400
I think you have that wrong, chief.

3249
03:20:59,940 --> 03:21:00,740
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

3250
03:21:05,420 --> 03:21:06,720
chopsticks are for fries.

3251
03:21:08,220 --> 03:21:08,320
Okay.

3252
03:21:09,060 --> 03:21:11,720
I didn't want to say it was one of those gaming chopsticks.

3253
03:21:13,060 --> 03:21:21,200
You know those ones that you like put on your fingers so
that you can so that you can type on your keyboard?

3254
03:21:22,600 --> 03:21:25,140
So I just called it a fork.

3255
03:21:29,980 --> 03:21:33,560
Because I was embarrassed to say, oh, I dropped my gaming
chopsticks.

3256
03:21:37,740 --> 03:21:38,860
No, dang it.

3257
03:21:38,880 --> 03:21:41,500
And then you guys start calling me out for it being a fork.

3258
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:50,420
work so no you guys know what i'm talking about right so you
put them in between like your index and your middle finger

3259
03:21:50,420 --> 03:21:59,980
and it like sticks there it stays there and then you can
like with your knuckles you like can you can um so you can

3260
03:21:59,980 --> 03:22:02,500
type and also have the chopsticks on your fingers

3261
03:22:05,580 --> 03:22:09,940
the little tweezers looking things yeah yeah yeah yeah
they're like barely chopsticks at all

3262
03:22:14,320 --> 03:22:15,920
That's what I was using.

3263
03:22:16,320 --> 03:22:18,680
I was embarrassed to say it.

3264
03:22:19,000 --> 03:22:20,820
Now I think I'm even more embarrassed.

3265
03:22:21,320 --> 03:22:21,800
Trying to imagine.

3266
03:22:21,880 --> 03:22:23,500
Let me see if I can get a picture real quick.

3267
03:22:29,560 --> 03:22:30,440
Oh, no.

3268
03:22:33,980 --> 03:22:36,040
I hate this image so much.

3269
03:22:37,340 --> 03:22:37,580
Okay.

3270
03:22:37,900 --> 03:22:38,820
This is what they're like.

3271
03:22:38,920 --> 03:22:40,300
This is what they're...

3272
03:22:40,980 --> 03:22:41,460
This

3273
03:22:46,670 --> 03:22:48,330
is what I was using.

3274
03:23:03,490 --> 03:23:10,750
Advanced Gamer Yeah, because I was holding my controller And
And eating my fries

3275
03:23:14,720 --> 03:23:33,520
Now you know I'd be embarrassed too I love my cringe Oshi A
murder case now Yeah For that, for the very reason that it

3276
03:23:33,520 --> 03:23:34,960
is such an important night.

3277
03:23:37,060 --> 03:23:38,060
Toes, toes!

3278
03:23:42,080 --> 03:23:43,780
Let's see, what else can I do?

3279
03:23:46,860 --> 03:23:48,280
Align, speaker.

3280
03:23:48,440 --> 03:23:49,320
Oh, let's lower the screen.

3281
03:23:49,640 --> 03:23:50,600
Let's watch the tape.

3282
03:23:51,160 --> 03:23:51,700
After all?

3283
03:23:57,440 --> 03:23:58,480
Let's watch the tape.

3284
03:24:01,780 --> 03:24:04,280
Oh, they don't seem to care at all, actually.

3285
03:24:04,940 --> 03:24:09,400
The junkyard where I died had a security camera, and it
captured the moment of my death perfectly.

3286
03:24:12,480 --> 03:24:15,460
And what the tape showed me was the cruelest truth
imaginable.

3287
03:24:15,620 --> 03:24:16,080
Uh-oh.

3288
03:24:24,400 --> 03:24:25,640
Oh my god, we're moving!

3289
03:24:25,740 --> 03:24:26,380
We're alive!

3290
03:24:30,840 --> 03:24:31,720
It was...

3291
03:24:35,050 --> 03:24:35,890
I don't know.

3292
03:24:37,530 --> 03:24:40,050
Oh my god, that briefcase has been there the whole time.

3293
03:24:40,890 --> 03:24:41,130
Oh!

3294
03:24:54,880 --> 03:24:56,040
Did she actually?

3295
03:25:11,840 --> 03:25:12,980
I was wrong.

3296
03:25:18,980 --> 03:25:19,960
Yeah, that's pretty conclusive.

3297
03:25:20,540 --> 03:25:22,000
I would say so.

3298
03:25:27,230 --> 03:25:30,070
I saw myself shot right before my own eyes.

3299
03:25:30,450 --> 03:25:30,990
By Lynn.

3300
03:25:31,590 --> 03:25:32,750
There goes my only lead.

3301
03:25:33,250 --> 03:25:34,910
I feel like I've died all over again.

3302
03:25:35,210 --> 03:25:37,370
Unless, unless they were blanks.

3303
03:25:38,390 --> 03:25:38,590
Right?

3304
03:25:38,990 --> 03:25:39,990
They must have been blanks.

3305
03:25:40,050 --> 03:25:42,490
And then when I died for real, she was like, oh my god.

3306
03:25:43,250 --> 03:25:43,690
What?

3307
03:25:45,870 --> 03:25:53,270
one thing sticks with me though Lynn looks so surprised on
that tape what in the world did I tell

3308
03:25:58,000 --> 03:26:04,640
her um the truth is the truth no matter how many times you
watch it Inspector Cabanela

3309
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:10,300
it wasn't me who played the tape just now baby

3310
03:26:13,520 --> 03:26:21,580
oh by the way okay we're just gonna ignore that fact by the
way Inspector Cabanela on that tape that troubles me what is

3311
03:26:21,580 --> 03:26:31,000
that chief of all ears I had to look at all the photos of
the crime scene as well but the place where the victim was

3312
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:42,360
shot and where the body was found is clearly different no
didn't we know that reason he got pushed down didn't he by

3313
03:26:42,360 --> 03:26:46,920
the by the bad guy yeah he got kicked and fell over.

3314
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:50,160
So we knew that already.

3315
03:26:52,140 --> 03:26:54,260
Yeah, the Hitman in Black is the one who kicked me
downstairs.

3316
03:26:55,900 --> 03:26:57,680
But I changed his fate, so he should have been...

3317
03:26:57,680 --> 03:26:58,180
Oh!

3318
03:27:02,750 --> 03:27:05,830
I changed his fate, so he should have been out of the
picture.

3319
03:27:07,990 --> 03:27:08,750
That's right!

3320
03:27:14,320 --> 03:27:16,400
But there I am, down on the lower level.

3321
03:27:18,880 --> 03:27:19,260
Hmm.

3322
03:27:20,320 --> 03:27:29,940
It's hard to remember what happened before and you know have
your the answer to your mystery right here a few minutes

3323
03:27:29,940 --> 03:27:39,300
after the murder took place oh okay nice oh my god security
cameras that actually work this is insane do I just fall

3324
03:27:39,300 --> 03:27:57,790
over cuz oh why was there a cat in my briefcase ow what is
what is that a black cat You got it, baby.

3325
03:27:58,190 --> 03:28:00,410
A furry feline messed up our crime scene.

3326
03:28:01,630 --> 03:28:04,430
And then the little cat Cobra vanished into the night.

3327
03:28:07,490 --> 03:28:10,970
Looks like my destiny of being knocked downstairs is very
hard to alter.

3328
03:28:12,890 --> 03:28:13,370
Uh-oh.

3329
03:28:16,740 --> 03:28:17,840
This is point X.

3330
03:28:18,140 --> 03:28:18,700
Come in, Chief.

3331
03:28:19,800 --> 03:28:20,500
Oh, my God.

3332
03:28:21,940 --> 03:28:22,520
The Chief here.

3333
03:28:23,000 --> 03:28:23,820
Did he show up?

3334
03:28:24,440 --> 03:28:24,860
No, sir.

3335
03:28:24,900 --> 03:28:25,960
Not yet, but...

3336
03:28:25,960 --> 03:28:26,420
Idiots.

3337
03:28:26,560 --> 03:28:28,200
I told you to stay off the radio unless it was over.

3338
03:28:28,220 --> 03:28:43,760
important but but this is important sir somebody else showed
up our rookie detective Lynn right row you see my baby over

3339
03:28:43,760 --> 03:28:56,440
there do you I heard she was on the lamb what do you want me
to do chief what do you say inspector there's no time for

3340
03:28:56,440 --> 03:29:09,380
dancing detective get my baby away from point X oh the
launch codes maybe the I think we know where they're

3341
03:29:09,380 --> 03:29:23,640
touching down do it now man and then hold on to her yes sir
I'll get her right now sir what is the meaning of this why

3342
03:29:23,640 --> 03:29:25,000
would lynch you up at point X

3343
03:29:29,500 --> 03:29:34,560
It took the Special Investigation Unit six months to
pinpoint that location.

3344
03:29:36,040 --> 03:29:38,980
Don't know, Chief, but I'd say it wasn't a coincidence.

3345
03:29:42,420 --> 03:29:44,620
Perhaps it was a ghost trick.

3346
03:29:46,020 --> 03:29:46,920
Oh, what?

3347
03:29:47,640 --> 03:29:48,520
Uh-oh.

3348
03:29:48,880 --> 03:29:49,280
Uh-oh.

3349
03:29:58,760 --> 03:29:59,320
Now what?

3350
03:29:59,520 --> 03:30:00,660
What happened this time?

3351
03:30:01,660 --> 03:30:02,420
Damn it.

3352
03:30:04,620 --> 03:30:06,160
Why did his feet do that?

3353
03:30:06,800 --> 03:30:08,600
This calls for a telephone call to point X.

3354
03:30:09,200 --> 03:30:09,580
Allow me.

3355
03:30:11,300 --> 03:30:12,220
Oh, yeah, you're allowed.

3356
03:30:15,740 --> 03:30:16,780
Trick time, baby.

3357
03:30:17,960 --> 03:30:18,880
No time to waste.

3358
03:30:23,600 --> 03:30:24,920
Maybe just a little bit time.

3359
03:30:25,080 --> 03:30:26,520
Why is he doing that with his feet?

3360
03:30:28,280 --> 03:30:29,880
Just a little bit of time to waste.

3361
03:30:31,140 --> 03:30:32,700
And then we lower it.

3362
03:30:33,500 --> 03:30:33,940
And then we lower it.

3363
03:30:35,100 --> 03:30:49,680
then we then we go telephone it what are you doing get your
buns over here oh shit is that her on the ground what did

You're so nasty.

3371
03:31:44,180 --> 03:31:44,680
What is that?

3372
03:31:44,680 --> 03:31:44,960

03:31:45,080 --> 03:31:45,260

03:31:52,910 --> 03:31:54,830
I'm getting my fork.

3376
03:31:58,530 --> 03:31:59,110
Off the ground.

3377
03:32:08,690 --> 03:32:09,290
My fork.

3378
03:32:14,550 --> 03:32:16,850
Off the ground.

3379
03:32:19,830 --> 03:32:20,710
Okay.

3380
03:32:21,450 --> 03:32:29,030

Mint, if your feet are ever itchy, I'm here for you, Queen.

3384
03:33:17,030 --> 03:33:18,530
Your being there isn't going to change anything.

3385
03:33:18,890 --> 03:33:19,930
Why put yourself through it?

3386
03:33:21,770 --> 03:33:24,590
I have a responsibility, and I'm going to see it through to
the end.

3387
03:33:25,810 --> 03:33:26,890
Okay, maybe he's not a bad guy.

3388
03:33:26,990 --> 03:33:27,850
I can't tell, actually.

3389
03:33:30,550 --> 03:33:32,750

3401

03:35:43,260 --> 03:35:44,780
Oh my god, she's dead.

3405
03:35:45,100 --> 03:35:45,780
She's dead.

3406
03:35:46,000 --> 03:35:46,700
She's dead.

3407
03:35:48,480 --> 03:35:49,440
Oh, the heavens.

3408
03:35:49,540 --> 03:35:52,000
What do I do if I had known something like this would
happen?

3409
03:35:52,100 --> 03:35:53,780
He's so smiley about it, though.

3410
03:35:54,180 --> 03:35:56,140
I would have paid the poor child more.

3411
03:35:57,200 --> 03:35:59,260
I would have cooked more chicken for her.

3412
03:35:59,740 --> 03:36:03,740
I would have sung to her as much as she liked until she had
her fill.

3413
03:36:04,720 --> 03:36:05,740
Actually, about the singing.

3414
03:36:06,360 --> 03:36:17,700
She did tell me she'd had a The chef seems to be in quite a
panic Oh, she's dead She's so cute You're too cute to die At

3415
03:36:17,700 --> 03:36:28,740
least it doesn't look like the waitress is dead Oh, just
kidding But this guy is That guy sure seems to be dead We're

3416
03:36:28,740 --> 03:36:30,540
just gonna roll down here

3417
03:36:36,690 --> 03:36:41,530
According to that police radio conversation I heard Lynn
should be here But I don't see her anywhere.

3418
03:36:42,590 --> 03:36:44,550
Seems like bad luck is in it for that redhead.

3419
03:36:45,930 --> 03:36:47,870
So I was half expecting to see her in trouble again.

3420
03:36:48,090 --> 03:36:48,850
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry.

3421
03:36:48,990 --> 03:36:54,290
I have an itch underneath the thing I put, the hot patch I
put on my shoulders.

3422
03:36:54,510 --> 03:36:56,470
But I can't get to it because it's...

3423
03:36:56,470 --> 03:36:56,650
Ow!

3424
03:36:57,510 --> 03:36:58,170
I'm good.

3425
03:37:00,130 --> 03:37:02,150
I spotted the corpse of the van driver.

3426
03:37:03,490 --> 03:37:04,750
That poor guy.

3427
03:37:04,870 --> 03:37:05,650
Oh, wait!

3428
03:37:07,270 --> 03:37:08,150
She's there!

3429
03:37:09,130 --> 03:37:10,010
Oh my god!

3430
03:37:11,690 --> 03:37:12,050
Why?

3431
03:37:12,050 --> 03:37:13,210
She was there!

3432
03:37:14,810 --> 03:37:15,950
Look at me, I'm dead!

3433
03:37:16,090 --> 03:37:17,250
What took you so long?

3434
03:37:20,630 --> 03:37:20,970
Huh?

3435
03:37:21,630 --> 03:37:23,070
Well, that's one way to greet a guy.

3436
03:37:24,090 --> 03:37:24,810
What happened here?

3437
03:37:28,870 --> 03:37:29,750
How should I know?

3438
03:37:29,910 --> 03:37:30,450
I'm the victim!

3439
03:37:32,350 --> 03:37:33,850
Is it just my imagination?

3440
03:37:34,030 --> 03:37:36,370
Or is she getting more and more brazen every time she dies?

3441
03:37:37,250 --> 03:37:38,450
Well, that's because I'm a detective.

3442
03:37:38,710 --> 03:37:39,730
I have to be tough, you know.

3443
03:37:42,170 --> 03:37:42,910
how did it go?

3444
03:37:43,530 --> 03:37:45,810
Did you check out tomorrow's work schedule for Prisoner
D-99?

3445
03:37:46,190 --> 03:37:46,630
Uh-oh.

3446
03:37:47,650 --> 03:37:48,950
Yeah, just like I promised.

3447
03:37:49,890 --> 03:37:51,270
Actually, I have a few things I want to ask.

3448
03:37:51,490 --> 03:37:52,970
I want to ask you about, too.

3449
03:37:54,070 --> 03:37:54,070
Sure.

3450
03:37:54,410 --> 03:37:56,610
We agree to use each other after all, right?

3451
03:37:57,410 --> 03:37:59,890
The troublesome GF experience?

3452
03:38:02,530 --> 03:38:03,930
Oh, no British accent?

3453
03:38:04,030 --> 03:38:04,430
Oh, sorry.

3454
03:38:05,970 --> 03:38:06,190
Okay.

3455
03:38:06,410 --> 03:38:07,590
Let's swap info then.

3456
03:38:13,890 --> 03:38:23,470
Let's save my murderer for right let's start with point look
we'll go we'll work our way up point X the police were

3457
03:38:23,470 --> 03:38:32,350
staking this restaurant out tonight they called it point X
point X huh that's a good name for this place that white

3458
03:38:32,350 --> 03:38:42,050
suited inspector was a surprise to find out you just
casually waltzed in here inspector Cabanela what in the

3459
03:38:42,050 --> 03:38:46,250
world made you pick this place anyway I guess I'd have to
say if you Because of you.

3460
03:38:47,150 --> 03:38:47,550
Me?

3461
03:38:48,070 --> 03:38:48,970
What did I do?

3462
03:38:49,950 --> 03:38:51,670
Every time she dies, she gets a new accent.

3463
03:38:54,610 --> 03:38:58,390
She dies as much as Maya gets arrested in Ace Attorney.

3464
03:38:58,570 --> 03:38:59,190
So true.

3465
03:39:00,650 --> 03:39:00,930
Oh!

3466
03:39:01,730 --> 03:39:03,470
Do you remember that note I found?

3467
03:39:04,530 --> 03:39:06,330
The note I didn't get a chance to read.

3468
03:39:07,190 --> 03:39:08,730
I had a place and a time written on it.

3469
03:39:08,810 --> 03:39:10,950
The Chicken Kitchen 10 p.m.

3470
03:39:12,490 --> 03:39:15,610
In other words, I was supposed to meet someone.

3471
03:39:15,630 --> 03:39:16,590
Somebody here tonight.

3472
03:39:20,330 --> 03:39:21,590
Yep, apparently so.

3473
03:39:22,470 --> 03:39:25,110
I just had to get that information you were going to give
me.

3474
03:39:25,950 --> 03:39:28,050
Or I just had to get that information you were going to give
me.

3475
03:39:28,630 --> 03:39:29,450
That's why I came here.

3476
03:39:29,830 --> 03:39:31,470
It was the only lead I had left.

3477
03:39:32,470 --> 03:39:32,910
Ah.

3478
03:39:34,950 --> 03:39:36,670
So this here is point X.

3479
03:39:37,270 --> 03:39:41,650
That must mean the mark the police were waiting for was me.

3480
03:39:52,510 --> 03:39:54,270
I feel like the music is a little too late.

3481
03:39:54,290 --> 03:39:56,150
light-hearted for what's going on.

3482
03:39:56,790 --> 03:39:59,210
Feels like you said, each prisoner had a little blackboard
in his cell.

3483
03:39:59,890 --> 03:40:04,770
But the thing is, there wasn't anything written on Prisoner
D-99's blackboard.

3484
03:40:05,470 --> 03:40:06,030
It was blank.

3485
03:40:07,290 --> 03:40:07,690
What?

3486
03:40:08,590 --> 03:40:11,970
I guess maybe it means his schedule for tomorrow hasn't been
decided yet?

3487
03:40:13,730 --> 03:40:14,230
Blank?

3488
03:40:18,720 --> 03:40:18,920
Huh?

3489
03:40:19,240 --> 03:40:21,220
I didn't think she'd lose it over a blank blackboard.

3490
03:40:22,360 --> 03:40:24,780
How come you're so upset about an undecided work schedule?

3491
03:40:25,320 --> 03:40:26,100
Oh, man.

3492
03:40:27,960 --> 03:40:32,420
I get the feeling that back when I was alive, I never had
much of a schedule to worry about myself.

3493
03:40:33,300 --> 03:40:36,180
Do you know what it means when a prisoner doesn't have a
schedule for the next day?

3494
03:40:37,560 --> 03:40:38,640
It means something?

3495
03:40:38,920 --> 03:40:39,600
Oh, gosh.

3496
03:40:39,940 --> 03:40:40,700
Cecil, please.

3497
03:40:42,420 --> 03:40:44,540
It doesn't mean he doesn't have work to do.

3498
03:40:45,060 --> 03:40:46,900
It's more like he can't work.

3499
03:40:47,720 --> 03:40:48,820
Because he's dead!

3500
03:40:50,240 --> 03:40:51,980
He's going to be executed!

3501
03:40:52,560 --> 03:40:52,960
Aha.

3502
03:40:55,280 --> 03:40:55,760
Executed?

3503
03:40:57,620 --> 03:40:57,940
Uh-oh.

3504
03:40:57,960 --> 03:40:58,880
Oh!

3505
03:40:59,840 --> 03:41:00,280
Execution.

3506
03:41:02,480 --> 03:41:05,380
Do you know what prisoner D99's crime was?

3507
03:41:06,380 --> 03:41:06,940
I think so.

3508
03:41:07,940 --> 03:41:11,140
They said something about him murdering his wife right in
front of a family member.

3509
03:41:12,000 --> 03:41:12,220
Her.

3510
03:41:13,300 --> 03:41:15,040
That's what they say, but it's not true.

3511
03:41:16,260 --> 03:41:16,820
He would never.

3512
03:41:17,320 --> 03:41:19,620
Detective Jowd would never do anything like that.

3513
03:41:20,760 --> 03:41:26,160
The death penalty hasn't been enforced in this country and
for a very long time, they're trying to get rid of him

3514
03:41:26,160 --> 03:41:27,200
because he knows something.

3515
03:41:27,960 --> 03:41:29,040
Not for decades.

3516
03:41:30,060 --> 03:41:33,060
Even if the prisoner wants it, like in this case.

3517
03:41:34,300 --> 03:41:35,920
The prisoner wants it.

3518
03:41:37,360 --> 03:41:39,540
There's definitely something else going on with this case.

3519
03:41:39,920 --> 03:41:40,740
I just know it.

3520
03:41:41,980 --> 03:41:43,400
And I have to find out what?

3521
03:41:45,640 --> 03:41:49,280
And if his work schedule is blank for tomorrow, I have to do
it right now!

3522
03:41:50,600 --> 03:41:56,040
So this prisoner D-99, Detective Jowd, he must be connected
to me in some way too.

3523
03:41:57,960 --> 03:42:04,680
not going to mention that like he had me drawn on his little
yeah look at that it's beautiful captures my best side and

3524
03:42:04,680 --> 03:42:21,390
everything after all he obviously knows me at last my
murderer on my way here I stopped by the chief of police his

3525
03:42:22,950 --> 03:42:32,030
office do you think he has a skip oh it was just on your way
was it and while While I was there, I saw who did it.

3526
03:42:32,530 --> 03:42:33,430
I saw my murderer.

3527
03:42:34,410 --> 03:42:34,930
You saw him?

3528
03:42:35,370 --> 03:42:35,610
Where?

3529
03:42:35,790 --> 03:42:36,030
How?

3530
03:42:37,030 --> 03:42:37,590
Not him.

3531
03:42:38,150 --> 03:42:38,450
Her.

3532
03:42:38,970 --> 03:42:42,270
There was a security camera set up there at the junkyard
where I got shot.

3533
03:42:43,270 --> 03:42:45,370
The security tape showed me the person who shot me.

3534
03:42:46,570 --> 03:42:47,310
It was a you.

3535
03:42:48,310 --> 03:42:50,790
And it was not AI generated.

3536
03:42:53,530 --> 03:42:53,590
Oh!

3537
03:42:55,150 --> 03:42:55,630
Flashback.

3538
03:42:55,810 --> 03:42:57,830
Were we possessed by the lamp?

3539
03:42:58,430 --> 03:43:00,570
Was she possessed by the lamp, maybe?

3540
03:43:01,330 --> 03:43:02,330
No way.

3541
03:43:03,310 --> 03:43:04,150
You're kidding, right?

3542
03:43:05,410 --> 03:43:07,970
What do you have to say for yourself, detective?

3543
03:43:10,250 --> 03:43:11,130
It wasn't me!

3544
03:43:11,550 --> 03:43:12,770
I didn't shoot you!

3545
03:43:13,950 --> 03:43:16,670
If I recall, this is what you said about who shot me.

3546
03:43:17,610 --> 03:43:19,850
My memory just isn't clear on that part.

3547
03:43:20,970 --> 03:43:23,210
So how can you say for sure that it wasn't you?

3548
03:43:24,690 --> 03:43:26,150
Because I told you before!

3549
03:43:27,090 --> 03:43:28,790
You were supposed to give me some information!

3550
03:43:29,870 --> 03:43:30,670
The lamp?

3551
03:43:30,690 --> 03:43:44,430
yeah the lamp information huh maybe that information was the
reason you shot me what what do you mean but why she shot me

3552
03:43:44,430 --> 03:43:50,510
what's the chat summary you

3553
03:43:54,090 --> 03:43:59,910
said you had some information on the case I'm looking into
so I would hardly shoot you before I even heard that

3554
03:43:59,910 --> 03:44:12,890
information right I agree that wouldn't make sense if it was
before huh but what if it was after you already gotten the

3555
03:44:12,890 --> 03:44:28,570
information from me bum bum bum bum bum oh she looks shocked
I definitely told you something then I killed you the lady

3556
03:44:28,570 --> 03:44:32,750
she's like no you know and whatever it It was.

3557
03:44:32,910 --> 03:44:34,050
It really shocked you.

3558
03:44:34,450 --> 03:44:35,450
What did I tell you?

3559
03:44:37,150 --> 03:44:38,450
I don't remember.

3560
03:44:38,590 --> 03:44:39,110
I don't know.

3561
03:44:39,530 --> 03:44:40,830
You've got to believe me.

3562
03:44:42,290 --> 03:44:45,090
After you saved me, I thought I got all of my memories back.

3563
03:44:45,990 --> 03:44:47,370
But maybe I really didn't.

3564
03:44:48,130 --> 03:44:49,510
I killed Bufasa.

3565
03:44:49,930 --> 03:44:51,850
I am your father, Luke.

3566
03:44:53,130 --> 03:44:54,350
You told me something.

3567
03:44:54,450 --> 03:44:55,830
I can't remember that part at all.

3568
03:44:56,350 --> 03:44:57,390
Because we were possessed.

3569
03:44:58,510 --> 03:45:00,250
You got the information you wanted from me.

3570
03:45:00,390 --> 03:45:01,350
And then you shot me.

3571
03:45:02,450 --> 03:45:03,750
Isn't that what happened?

3572
03:45:05,010 --> 03:45:06,530
No, no, I didn't shoot you!

3573
03:45:08,310 --> 03:45:09,090
Please tell me.

3574
03:45:09,470 --> 03:45:10,950
What did you tell me that time?

3575
03:45:11,090 --> 03:45:12,870
How am I- You know I have no memories.

3576
03:45:13,030 --> 03:45:14,450
I don't even know how to read, Lynn.

3577
03:45:14,710 --> 03:45:15,650
I can't even read.

3578
03:45:16,550 --> 03:45:17,810
What did I learn from you?

3579
03:45:21,390 --> 03:45:23,090
So, what are you going to do now?

3580
03:45:24,430 --> 03:45:26,330
I mean, you fulfilled your goal, right?

3581
03:45:26,950 --> 03:45:28,430
You found out who shot you.

3582
03:45:30,550 --> 03:45:31,990
Are you going to get revenge?

3583
03:45:32,450 --> 03:45:47,150
would be easy enough to do all you have to do is not save me
oh it's kind of a dilemma huh if I don't save her um you

3584
03:45:47,150 --> 03:45:57,410
know I end the I end the game to end this stream is this the
ending I was hoping for had I unraveled all of the mysteries

3585
03:45:57,410 --> 03:46:03,530
of me gosh I can see why so many people say this is their
favorite game ever it just ends like that.

3586
03:46:05,870 --> 03:46:06,150
That's it.

3587
03:46:06,390 --> 03:46:07,070
That's the story.

3588
03:46:08,330 --> 03:46:09,190
What am I going to do now?

3589
03:46:09,610 --> 03:46:10,990
I'm going to save you, that's what.

3590
03:46:11,990 --> 03:46:12,470
You are?

3591
03:46:13,810 --> 03:46:15,070
I want to know everything.

3592
03:46:15,930 --> 03:46:17,790
Who I was, why I was killed.

3593
03:46:19,570 --> 03:46:21,730
Yeah, I'd like to know who those guys are too.

3594
03:46:21,910 --> 03:46:23,790
The little blue guys and the grapes.

3595
03:46:26,050 --> 03:46:28,370
I want answers and I'm gonna find them.

3596
03:46:29,410 --> 03:46:31,030
But to do that, I'm gonna need your help.

3597
03:46:32,810 --> 03:46:33,270
Okay.

3598
03:46:33,990 --> 03:46:34,970
I won't say thank you.

3599
03:46:35,370 --> 03:46:35,850
Not yet.

3600
03:46:36,610 --> 03:46:37,930
And I won't say I'm sorry either.

3601
03:46:38,590 --> 03:46:41,430
But I'll help see to it that you get your answers.

3602
03:46:42,730 --> 03:46:42,890
Good.

3603
03:46:44,150 --> 03:46:46,390
Now I think it's time to go back to the past.

3604
03:46:47,310 --> 03:46:50,850
I can't leave you lying flattened under a huge chunk of
chicken forever after all.

3605
03:46:51,830 --> 03:46:51,950
Hmm.

3606
03:46:53,890 --> 03:46:54,350
Ooh.

3607
03:46:54,490 --> 03:46:55,370
Oh, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

3608
03:46:58,040 --> 03:46:59,020
Alrighty, guys.

3609
03:46:59,120 --> 03:47:00,900
Let's solve this chicken dinner.

3610
03:47:03,620 --> 03:47:05,080
Let's cook this roast.

3611
03:47:05,440 --> 03:47:08,620
I mean, let's prep this roast.

3612
03:47:09,560 --> 03:47:11,680
The note says the chicken kitchen at 10 p.m.

3613
03:47:12,660 --> 03:47:15,800
I wonder who that pointy-haired man was going to meet here.

3614
03:47:16,720 --> 03:47:17,440
You know my name.

3615
03:47:17,580 --> 03:47:18,300
You know I'm Cicel.

3616
03:47:19,940 --> 03:47:20,520
What's this?

3617
03:47:21,020 --> 03:47:21,760
Today's special.

3618
03:47:26,220 --> 03:47:29,380
Oh my gosh, she's so cute.

3619
03:47:31,740 --> 03:47:32,780
She's so...

3620
03:47:32,780 --> 03:47:33,680
Whoa, I thought...

3621
03:47:34,140 --> 03:47:35,440
Oh my gosh, I thought that was like a...

3622
03:47:35,460 --> 03:47:36,900
alien lady for a second.

3623
03:47:39,720 --> 03:47:40,680
Bing bong.

3624
03:47:41,600 --> 03:47:44,140
I don't think she fits the vibe of this restaurant.

3625
03:47:44,980 --> 03:47:45,940
I love it though.

3626
03:47:51,410 --> 03:47:55,230
Can, yeah, can someone convince Kiara to get a skater outfit
like that next?

3627
03:47:57,110 --> 03:47:58,950
Can someone please convince her?

3628
03:47:59,350 --> 03:48:01,190
We need like a... Can I eat that thing?

3629
03:48:01,330 --> 03:48:02,410
Oh my gosh, Lynn, please.

3630
03:48:08,660 --> 03:48:09,220
Whoa!

3631
03:48:09,740 --> 03:48:10,180
Whoa!

3632
03:48:10,980 --> 03:48:11,720
Oh my god.

3633
03:48:13,680 --> 03:48:14,160
Oh.

3634
03:48:15,020 --> 03:48:15,500
No.

3635
03:48:16,780 --> 03:48:17,620
Oh my god.

3636
03:48:18,520 --> 03:48:18,600
Oh.

3637
03:48:19,280 --> 03:48:19,620
Phew.

3638
03:48:22,840 --> 03:48:24,060
Lynn's got moves.

3639
03:48:24,300 --> 03:48:24,680
Yeah, she do.

3640
03:48:25,980 --> 03:48:29,220
You're just going bigger and better with each new death,
aren't you?

3641
03:48:30,160 --> 03:48:31,040
Leave me alone.

3642
03:48:31,300 --> 03:48:33,980
Can I help it if I got tired of dying the usual ways?

3643
03:48:34,460 --> 03:48:36,160
You could have just moved, Lynn.

3644
03:48:36,260 --> 03:48:37,320
You could have just moved.

3645
03:48:37,800 --> 03:48:38,720
But I'll say this.

3646
03:48:39,000 --> 03:48:40,960
It was a death any detective could be proud of.

3647
03:48:41,840 --> 03:48:42,240
Huh?

3648
03:48:42,600 --> 03:48:43,400
What makes you say that?

3649
03:48:43,580 --> 03:48:47,640
Because you saved her, you saved the girl, the way you saved
someone else before dying yourself.

3650
03:48:48,680 --> 03:48:49,320
Oh, that waitress?

3651
03:48:49,680 --> 03:48:50,820
The one with the chicken on her head?

3652
03:48:51,460 --> 03:48:56,400
The next time you put a chicken on your head, you should try
one about the size of the waitresses.

3653
03:48:57,680 --> 03:48:59,260
I'll make a note of that for next time.

3654
03:49:00,440 --> 03:49:05,460
But anyway, if you hadn't tried to save that waitress, you'd
still be alive.

3655
03:49:06,020 --> 03:49:06,680
No, no.

3656
03:49:06,940 --> 03:49:08,740
We're not choosing lives here.

3657
03:49:09,360 --> 03:49:10,360
I couldn't help it.

3658
03:49:10,980 --> 03:49:16,960
the detective thing and all i wasn't able to save that poor
van driver though i don't think there's no helping that guy

3659
03:49:16,960 --> 03:49:25,220
at the speed he must have died instantly well we can't let a
heroic detective like you stay dead the root of this whole

3660
03:49:25,220 --> 03:49:34,500
disaster is clear chicken the question is how do i stop it
okay let's get started hmm

3661
03:49:41,700 --> 03:50:06,700
Trick time Okay Menu board Sign Let's ring the bell Trick
Hello ma'am Oh my god she's so cute She's so cute You rang

3662
03:50:06,700 --> 03:50:07,980
Huh?

3663
03:50:08,300 --> 03:50:09,760
Oh sorry I didn't ring the bell.

3664
03:50:10,740 --> 03:50:11,760
Oh, okay, I get it.

3665
03:50:12,200 --> 03:50:13,880
This was a little dig, wasn't it?

3666
03:50:14,260 --> 03:50:16,420
Kind of like, hey, where's my food, right?

3667
03:50:17,180 --> 03:50:18,200
No, not at all.

3668
03:50:18,580 --> 03:50:19,920
Besides, I didn't ring it.

3669
03:50:20,600 --> 03:50:21,160
Oh, okay.

3670
03:50:21,580 --> 03:50:22,640
That's all right, then.

3671
03:50:23,360 --> 03:50:25,800
But the chef is the one who makes the chicken.

3672
03:50:26,160 --> 03:50:28,100
No sense in harassing me about it, right?

3673
03:50:28,480 --> 03:50:28,680
Dang.

3674
03:50:30,260 --> 03:50:31,800
Just keep that in mind, okay?

3675
03:50:33,500 --> 03:50:33,940
Bye.

3676
03:50:35,480 --> 03:50:36,280
Odd, girl.

3677
03:50:36,820 --> 03:50:37,400
I agree.

3678
03:50:38,000 --> 03:50:38,480
Me too.

3679
03:50:39,800 --> 03:50:40,960
What's wrong with her?

3680
03:50:41,120 --> 03:50:41,780
She didn't do anything.

3681
03:50:41,960 --> 03:50:42,480
What's this?

3682
03:50:43,600 --> 03:50:44,380
It's no use.

3683
03:50:44,500 --> 03:50:45,520
I can't read what it says.

3684
03:50:45,820 --> 03:50:46,240
Oh, let's see.

3685
03:50:47,520 --> 03:50:48,960
Now I remember what the sign says.

3686
03:50:49,440 --> 03:50:51,440
If you would like some water, please ring the bell.

3687
03:50:51,540 --> 03:50:53,280
Oh, three times.

3688
03:50:54,260 --> 03:50:54,560
Okay.

3689
03:50:55,500 --> 03:50:58,220
The waitress doesn't bring any water if you only ring the
bell once.

3690
03:50:58,600 --> 03:51:00,040
She said, those are the rules, apparently.

3691
03:51:00,740 --> 03:51:01,440
I said, apparently?

3692
03:51:01,740 --> 03:51:02,480
What do you mean, apparently?

3693
03:51:02,780 --> 03:51:03,420
Don't you work here?

3694
03:51:04,320 --> 03:51:06,260
Quite a stickler for the details, this detective.

3695
03:51:07,700 --> 03:51:08,060
Okay.

3696
03:51:08,660 --> 03:51:09,660
So let's...

3697
03:51:14,870 --> 03:51:16,010
You wrote this note, right?

3698
03:51:16,950 --> 03:51:18,810
I think so, but I don't remember.

3699
03:51:21,770 --> 03:51:22,130
10 o'clock.

3700
03:51:22,330 --> 03:51:25,050
That means it's already time for your meeting with whoever
it is.

3701
03:51:25,630 --> 03:51:29,530
Now that I think about it, whoever you were supposed to meet
might already be here.

3702
03:51:30,310 --> 03:51:31,830
You think the detective...

3703
03:51:31,830 --> 03:51:32,910
You're the detective.

3704
03:51:33,470 --> 03:51:35,330
Well, I can't read it anymore.

3705
03:51:35,790 --> 03:51:37,410
Shouldn't you have checked out when you got here?

3706
03:51:38,490 --> 03:51:40,770
Sorry, the chicken at this restaurant is really good.

3707
03:51:41,370 --> 03:51:46,970
you know um no i don't know take a look around the rest of
the restaurant

3708
03:51:50,310 --> 03:52:06,390
okay we're zooming around wow that's fancy but there's these
guys time is passing uh and then her aren't you gonna

3709
03:52:06,390 --> 03:52:12,690
deliver my food the chicken is just sitting there What are
you doing with that?

3710
03:52:15,790 --> 03:52:17,490
Okay, we hit it three times.

3711
03:52:18,190 --> 03:52:18,850
Give me my water.

3712
03:52:19,870 --> 03:52:20,570
Thank you, ma'am.

3713
03:52:25,150 --> 03:52:27,110
You want more water?

3714
03:52:30,100 --> 03:52:31,820
Um, I stay hydrated?

3715
03:52:31,980 --> 03:52:32,680
What's your issue?

3716
03:52:33,420 --> 03:52:34,580
Sorry, I didn't ring the bell.

3717
03:52:35,400 --> 03:52:37,140
And what's with the more water bit?

3718
03:52:37,960 --> 03:52:39,120
Oh, well, come on.

3719
03:52:39,200 --> 03:52:40,300
This is your third glass.

3720
03:52:40,900 --> 03:52:41,860
Okay, I get it.

3721
03:52:41,900 --> 03:52:43,260
This was a little dig, wasn't it?

3722
03:52:43,480 --> 03:52:44,660
Kind of like, oh, where's my food?

3723
03:52:47,560 --> 03:52:50,300
I would like to see you bringing me my chicken soon.

3724
03:52:51,200 --> 03:52:51,720
Dually noticed.

3725
03:52:52,440 --> 03:52:54,520
In the meantime, enjoy a nice glass of water.

3726
03:52:55,460 --> 03:52:55,900
Dang.

3727
03:52:57,660 --> 03:52:58,540
Thank you.

3728
03:53:00,120 --> 03:53:00,920
Odd girl.

3729
03:53:01,220 --> 03:53:01,760
I agree.

3730
03:53:02,180 --> 03:53:02,720
I agree.

3731
03:53:04,840 --> 03:53:05,180
Okay.

3732
03:53:06,220 --> 03:53:07,620
Uh, what do they say?

3733
03:53:08,880 --> 03:53:10,360
What's taking my chicken so long?

3734
03:53:10,500 --> 03:53:14,620
Unfortunately for you, according to what we saw before, the
van arrives before your chicken's done.

3735
03:53:15,840 --> 03:53:18,000
In any case, just hanging around here isn't going to fix
anything.

3736
03:53:18,360 --> 03:53:20,080
I'll have to look for a way to get beyond this area.

3737
03:53:20,620 --> 03:53:22,300
Oh, when she comes over, I have to...

3738
03:53:22,300 --> 03:53:24,160
One, two, three.

3739
03:53:24,820 --> 03:53:26,620
Sorry, I'm bullying her a little bit.

3740
03:53:27,220 --> 03:53:28,500
I'm harassing the...

3741
03:53:32,910 --> 03:53:34,230
There we go.

3742
03:53:37,650 --> 03:53:38,370
Thank you.

3743
03:53:41,330 --> 03:53:41,770
Alrighty.

3744
03:53:45,150 --> 03:53:57,210
Nice Trick time To the cart And there it is I was like Are
we going to go up?

3745
03:53:57,590 --> 03:54:02,670
Time is passing Do you think this girl likes her job?

3746
03:54:03,810 --> 03:54:08,370
I think if I could rollerblade everywhere I would be very
excited about that Oh wait what did he say?

3747
03:54:08,670 --> 03:54:22,770
Here you go That's a big trunk this is one big trunk seems
pretty heavy too it's very suspicious and red my body is in

3748
03:54:22,770 --> 03:54:33,150
there let's see what's in it sorry but that's not possible
it's locked darn I wanted to see what was inside okay now we

3749
03:54:33,150 --> 03:54:43,550
can eavesdrop on these guys so what do you think my dear
beauty do you really think We can trust this deal.

3750
03:54:44,630 --> 03:54:45,270
Who knows?

3751
03:54:45,690 --> 03:54:47,370
It's not our job to think about that.

3752
03:54:48,110 --> 03:54:52,270
But those incidents did happen in this country, just as he
predicted.

3753
03:54:53,770 --> 03:54:56,830
Yes, and they were pretty amusing too, weren't they?

3754
03:54:58,010 --> 03:55:02,550
That fellow who sang out national secrets during live TV
broadcast?

3755
03:55:03,890 --> 03:55:09,350
And the man who laid siege to the Metro Police Department,
taking the top dog hostage.

3756
03:55:11,950 --> 03:55:16,270
If he had double crosses us, it wouldn't be pretty.

3757
03:55:17,790 --> 03:55:18,130
No, no.

3758
03:55:18,650 --> 03:55:20,130
He needs this deal, too.

3759
03:55:20,990 --> 03:55:23,210
And we've accepted all his conditions as well.

3760
03:55:24,370 --> 03:55:29,590
Yes, and thanks to that, we have to be here on this extra
little assignment.

3761
03:55:30,990 --> 03:55:35,290
But as long as I'm paired up with you, Beauty, I don't mind.

3762
03:55:38,070 --> 03:55:39,450
How do these two...

3763
03:55:41,950 --> 03:55:59,350
at the special prison yeah that guy's voice is so I know
right great voice acting thank you special prison the guy

3764
03:55:59,350 --> 03:56:05,350
who sang national secrets the man who held siege to Metro
police those cases are classified information well wouldn't

3765
03:56:05,350 --> 03:56:11,930
everyone know about the secrets because it happened at a
concert like hmm

3766
03:56:15,620 --> 03:56:18,920
I've heard about both of those cases, and recently, too.

3767
03:56:20,120 --> 03:56:23,300
The perpetrators in those cases are being held at a special
facility.

3768
03:56:25,680 --> 03:56:26,940
That's what the special prison is.

3769
03:56:27,340 --> 03:56:29,400
But it's not known about it by the general public.

3770
03:56:30,880 --> 03:56:34,620
So, prisoner D-99, Detective Jowd is one of these special
cases, too, huh?

3771
03:56:37,800 --> 03:56:39,160
Oh, it's a cover-up.

3772
03:56:39,740 --> 03:56:41,940
They erased the concertgoer's memories?

3773
03:56:42,140 --> 03:56:43,620
They have the power to do that!

3774
03:56:44,080 --> 03:56:45,420
They silenced the crowd.

3775
03:56:45,620 --> 03:56:46,700
With a gun?

3776
03:56:49,020 --> 03:56:52,240
These two are talking about the very same cases I heard
about just tonight.

3777
03:56:52,560 --> 03:56:52,940
How convenient.

3778
03:56:53,180 --> 03:56:58,240
Also, this guy's, like, margarita glass head is crazy.

3779
03:57:00,160 --> 03:57:02,000
That couldn't be just a coincidence, could it?

3780
03:57:08,180 --> 03:57:10,160
Is that a whip she's holding?

3781
03:57:10,700 --> 03:57:11,340
Or is that a...

3782
03:57:11,340 --> 03:57:12,140
That's not a cane.

3783
03:57:13,140 --> 03:57:13,500
Hmm.

3784
03:57:14,840 --> 03:57:16,540
What is that beauty?

3785
03:57:17,500 --> 03:57:18,020
Hmm.

3786
03:57:18,040 --> 03:57:20,540
Why don't we move to a different spot?

3787
03:57:23,600 --> 03:57:24,240
Waiter?

3788
03:57:24,620 --> 03:57:25,840
All the way over there.

3789
03:57:27,280 --> 03:57:28,680
That table in the back looks good.

3790
03:57:31,120 --> 03:57:34,480
Oh, now you're talking, beauty, my dear.

3791
03:57:35,040 --> 03:57:37,620
Just what I've been waiting for.

3792
03:57:38,480 --> 03:57:40,640
A quiet, secluded spot.

3793
03:57:41,140 --> 03:57:42,660
Just the two of us.

3794
03:57:43,300 --> 03:57:45,040
I wouldn't object to that.

3795
03:57:48,040 --> 03:57:51,600
I get this feeling somebody is eavesdropping.

3796
03:57:52,260 --> 03:57:55,020
My sixth sense is very strong, you know.

3797
03:57:55,460 --> 03:57:56,120
Oh!

3798
03:57:56,960 --> 03:58:00,080
Oh my god, she's noticing me?

3799
03:58:00,820 --> 03:58:01,600
Okay, beauty.

3800
03:58:03,020 --> 03:58:04,480
That's all right, my dear.

3801
03:58:04,660 --> 03:58:06,700
You don't have to make excuses.

3802
03:58:08,440 --> 03:58:14,020
Off we go across the bridge of poultry to the land of love.

3803
03:58:15,320 --> 03:58:15,980
Wait.

3804
03:58:16,660 --> 03:58:17,340
Take the chicken!

3805
03:58:18,040 --> 03:58:18,960
No, no, no!

3806
03:58:20,940 --> 03:58:22,340
Oh, I'm just...

3807
03:58:22,340 --> 03:58:22,760
No!

3808
03:58:24,860 --> 03:58:26,660
Oh, we get to watch them.

3809
03:58:26,960 --> 03:58:27,800
Oh, God!

3810
03:58:28,520 --> 03:58:28,860
God!

3811
03:58:32,480 --> 03:58:34,000
Stop with the Superchat.

3812
03:58:34,100 --> 03:58:34,720
What does that mean?

3813
03:58:35,620 --> 03:58:36,340
What just happened?

3814
03:58:36,700 --> 03:58:37,740
Did she sense we were here?

3815
03:58:38,940 --> 03:58:39,420
What?

3816
03:58:39,660 --> 03:58:40,820
With her sixth sense?

3817
03:58:41,300 --> 03:58:44,720
But, you know, I have some pretty amazing powers myself.

3818
03:58:46,160 --> 03:58:46,560
Yeah?

3819
03:58:46,760 --> 03:58:47,320
I'm like, what?

3820
03:58:48,520 --> 03:58:49,000
Like...

3821
03:58:49,000 --> 03:58:49,580
Like if there's...

3822
03:58:49,600 --> 03:58:50,400
There's chicken nearby.

3823
03:58:50,740 --> 03:58:51,680
I can tell right away.

3824
03:58:53,120 --> 03:58:54,580
That's called a sense of smell.

3825
03:58:55,620 --> 03:58:58,320
But anyway, at least the situation has changed a little bit
now.

3826
03:59:00,160 --> 03:59:01,040
Fate changed.

3827
03:59:03,060 --> 03:59:03,500
Uh...

3828
03:59:04,120 --> 03:59:05,780
I don't believe in a sixth sense.

3829
03:59:06,060 --> 03:59:07,360
It's not scientific.

3830
03:59:09,700 --> 03:59:11,020
Says the ghost.

3831
03:59:12,040 --> 03:59:13,000
Come to think of it.

3832
03:59:13,540 --> 03:59:14,960
We've been left behind, haven't we?

3833
03:59:15,020 --> 03:59:16,060
Yeah, we're kind of stuck here.

3834
03:59:16,340 --> 03:59:17,120
It looks that way.

3835
03:59:18,080 --> 03:59:19,580
Not having legs is even more inconvenient.

3836
03:59:19,600 --> 03:59:20,800
than I thought it would be.

3837
03:59:22,000 --> 03:59:23,180
What are we going to do now?

3838
03:59:23,840 --> 03:59:24,840
They're all the way over there.

3839
03:59:25,600 --> 03:59:27,300
I'm telling you, we'd better shake a leg.

3840
03:59:27,660 --> 03:59:29,120
We're going to miss what they're saying.

3841
03:59:30,800 --> 03:59:32,400
It'd be pretty hard to shake a leg.

3842
03:59:33,120 --> 03:59:34,660
Not having legs and all.

3843
03:59:35,500 --> 03:59:35,880
Meow.

3844
03:59:36,180 --> 03:59:37,700
Oh my god, he's blowing kisses at her.

3845
03:59:38,500 --> 03:59:40,060
They're still talking about something.

3846
03:59:40,940 --> 03:59:42,100
I want to hear!

3847
03:59:42,940 --> 03:59:43,440
Me too.

3848
03:59:44,360 --> 03:59:45,400
Alright, let's figure what.

3849
03:59:45,460 --> 03:59:46,780
Oh, what are we doing here?

3850
03:59:49,600 --> 04:00:03,200
a drink right can we we tried examining this and okay yeah
we it's still the same thing what is what if we dispense a

3851
04:00:03,200 --> 04:00:08,460
bottle oh oh oh oh oh oh

3852
04:00:12,710 --> 04:00:19,650
okay she

3853
04:00:23,520 --> 04:00:26,560
only comes for one bell here.

3854
04:00:30,640 --> 04:00:33,500
Wait, we make them a drink and she delivers it.

3855
04:00:36,560 --> 04:00:38,260
We make them a drink and she delivers it.

3856
04:00:38,760 --> 04:00:39,280
You're right.

3857
04:00:39,940 --> 04:00:40,580
Oh, I get it.

3858
04:00:40,620 --> 04:00:43,220
You saw that couple over there and you started to get
lonely, right?

3859
04:00:43,880 --> 04:00:45,500
And so you decided to call me.

3860
04:00:45,880 --> 04:00:47,100
Oh, that's so sweet.

3861
04:00:47,980 --> 04:00:48,660
Forgive me.

3862
04:00:49,020 --> 04:00:50,420
But I didn't ring for anybody.

3863
04:00:51,360 --> 04:00:51,760
What?

3864
04:00:52,740 --> 04:00:54,620
No, could you not stand in my light, please?

3865
04:00:54,780 --> 04:00:55,640
I can't see my glasses.

3866
04:00:55,660 --> 04:01:02,300
properly i've been working here for two days and i've been
waiting this whole time for you to notice me now would you

3867
04:01:02,300 --> 04:01:05,260
stop trying to shake me up and just stick to shaking
cocktails

3868
04:01:08,660 --> 04:01:15,460
okay no she's heartbroken with her unrequited love she has a
surprisingly short career with this place

3869
04:01:21,820 --> 04:01:30,160
okay she's back already oh so fast okay trick time Make them
a drink.

3870
04:01:34,220 --> 04:01:35,340
Oh, it just overflows!

3871
04:01:36,940 --> 04:01:38,000
Oh, I thought I could...

3872
04:01:38,000 --> 04:01:38,220
Okay.

3873
04:01:39,180 --> 04:01:42,980
I didn't realize it was going to be a cutscene.

3874
04:01:43,300 --> 04:01:47,720
I thought I would be able to ghost trick it to stop it.

3875
04:01:48,440 --> 04:01:49,560
You just broke that glass.

3876
04:01:49,880 --> 04:01:51,220
Just like you did my heart.

3877
04:01:52,100 --> 04:01:55,600
A broken glass can never be put back the way it was.

3878
04:01:56,040 --> 04:01:56,940
Just leave it there.

3879
04:01:57,760 --> 04:01:58,760
You can't just leave it.

3880
04:01:58,800 --> 04:02:00,000
Somebody might get hurt!

3881
04:02:03,240 --> 04:02:05,700
Doesn't this trunk belong to that couple over there?

3882
04:02:08,920 --> 04:02:12,760
The only things we're allowed customers to lose here are
their cares.

3883
04:02:13,620 --> 04:02:17,280
Miss, please go and let them know about the trunk, if you
would be so kind.

3884
04:02:19,100 --> 04:02:20,120
How gallant of you.

3885
04:02:20,440 --> 04:02:22,080
I just might fall for you, you know.

3886
04:02:23,360 --> 04:02:23,840
Yippee!

3887
04:02:24,400 --> 04:02:25,020
We got it.

3888
04:02:25,080 --> 04:02:25,240
Okay.

3889
04:02:28,300 --> 04:02:29,540
Oh, odd girl.

3890
04:02:29,840 --> 04:02:30,440
I agree.

3891
04:02:30,880 --> 04:02:31,660
I agree.

3892
04:02:33,640 --> 04:02:34,440
I agree.

3893
04:02:35,520 --> 04:02:36,080
I agree.

3894
04:02:37,740 --> 04:02:38,300
I agree.

3895
04:02:38,300 --> 04:02:39,440
I agree.

3896
04:02:39,620 --> 04:02:41,540
Wait, we have to wait for him to put the glass down, maybe.

3897
04:02:45,490 --> 04:02:45,710
Oh.

3898
04:02:46,430 --> 04:02:46,710
Wait.

3899
04:02:47,110 --> 04:02:47,550
Uh-oh.

3900
04:02:48,110 --> 04:02:48,850
Oh, there it is.

3901
04:02:49,270 --> 04:02:49,810
Oh, not yet.

3902
04:02:49,830 --> 04:02:50,110
Not yet.

3903
04:02:50,170 --> 04:02:50,430
Almost.

3904
04:02:50,690 --> 04:02:51,310
There we go.

3905
04:02:51,450 --> 04:02:51,870
Oh my gosh.

3906
04:02:51,970 --> 04:02:54,330
Sorry for going back and forth so many times.

3907
04:02:56,530 --> 04:02:57,110
Well, goodbye.

3908
04:02:58,530 --> 04:03:02,190
I've been working here for two days and I've had my eye on
you the whole time.

3909
04:03:02,350 --> 04:03:05,150
I think this might be my last night working here though.

3910
04:03:05,830 --> 04:03:05,830
What?

3911
04:03:06,630 --> 04:03:07,550
It's been fun.

3912
04:03:07,830 --> 04:03:09,410
Wait, you just got here.

3913
04:03:11,070 --> 04:03:15,070
I guess she's leaving this place with her surprisingly short
career intact.

3914
04:03:18,570 --> 04:03:19,630
Oh, here he comes.

3915
04:03:22,310 --> 04:03:28,290
Of all things to forget, it wouldn't have been pretty if I
forgot this.

3916
04:03:29,690 --> 04:03:37,670
You know who I'm trying to channel is Thunderburger from
Over the Garden Wall.

3917
04:03:39,230 --> 04:03:41,990
I think that's who I'm trying to channel.

3918
04:03:45,410 --> 04:03:45,650
All right.

3919
04:03:46,170 --> 04:03:47,230
Here we are, finally.

3920
04:03:48,910 --> 04:03:49,810
Not Shaggy?

3921
04:03:52,530 --> 04:03:54,310
Like Scooby-Doo Shaggy?

3922
04:03:55,150 --> 04:03:57,370
No, he's like, Oh, Zoex!

3923
04:04:00,550 --> 04:04:01,510
Like Scoob.

3924
04:04:02,110 --> 04:04:04,410
He's got, like, a totally different voice.

3925
04:04:06,790 --> 04:04:08,610
I thought it was Shaggy.

3926
04:04:10,370 --> 04:04:11,370
Not at all.

3927
04:04:20,190 --> 04:04:22,510
I feel kind of bad about eavesdropping, though.

3928
04:04:22,570 --> 04:04:23,050
I don't.

3929
04:04:23,910 --> 04:04:24,370
Not me.

3930
04:04:24,610 --> 04:04:24,970
Yeah.

3931
04:04:25,270 --> 04:04:26,070
I'm on Lin's side.

3932
04:04:26,210 --> 04:04:28,590
I mean, we just delivered their lost trunk to them after
all.

3933
04:04:28,990 --> 04:04:30,250
They owe us at least that much.

3934
04:04:31,030 --> 04:04:32,970
What kind of detective says something like that?

3935
04:04:34,750 --> 04:04:50,770
fate changed so can we listen in on them now oh we can be
flowers oh we can whoa I'll swing a little bit oh my god

3936
04:04:50,770 --> 04:05:03,030
whoa I can't believe I forgot the trunk of all things now
I'm hearing shaggy with such a small body you probably only

3937
04:05:04,110 --> 04:05:04,690
match.

3938
04:05:05,970 --> 04:05:07,290
Ouch, that hurts beauty.

3939
04:05:07,690 --> 04:05:10,450
Oh no, I can't do, now I'm doing scoby.

3940
04:05:11,110 --> 04:05:11,950
I mean shaggy.

3941
04:05:13,230 --> 04:05:14,890
But like, that's okay.

3942
04:05:15,650 --> 04:05:17,630
That's what I love about you.

3943
04:05:19,790 --> 04:05:21,370
That's what he loves about her.

3944
04:05:21,590 --> 04:05:22,470
Oh my gosh, Lynn.

3945
04:05:23,130 --> 04:05:23,970
Don't kink shame.

3946
04:05:24,870 --> 04:05:25,790
I don't get it either.

3947
04:05:27,270 --> 04:05:28,290
Now where were we?

3948
04:05:28,830 --> 04:05:29,610
Oh, right.

3949
04:05:30,070 --> 04:05:31,750
Oh, to invite to the wedding.

3950
04:05:34,170 --> 04:05:44,410
that is of course with him she's like I'm glad there's
nobody around to listen to this we can talk about that when

3951
04:05:44,410 --> 04:05:58,910
we're alone but aren't we alone now beauty do you think she
senses our presence again I spy a ladybug oh ladybug I just

3952
04:05:58,910 --> 04:06:04,410

3953
04:06:07,170 --> 04:06:07,590
What?

3954
04:06:12,800 --> 04:06:13,380
Uh-oh.

3955
04:06:13,820 --> 04:06:14,640
Uh-oh.

3956
04:06:14,960 --> 04:06:16,880
Death is imminent, I suppose.

3957
04:06:18,880 --> 04:06:19,720
Death is...

3958
04:06:20,040 --> 04:06:22,220
After all that trouble, it happened anyway!

3959
04:06:23,180 --> 04:06:24,900
It looks that way, yes.

3960
04:06:25,400 --> 04:06:26,580
It's not over yet, though.

3961
04:06:27,380 --> 04:06:27,740
It's not?

3962
04:06:27,800 --> 04:06:28,640
What are you talking about?

3963
04:06:29,320 --> 04:06:30,620
You're not dead yet.

3964
04:06:32,080 --> 04:06:32,640
No.

3965
04:06:32,940 --> 04:06:33,640
I'm just...

3966
04:06:33,640 --> 04:06:35,500
I'm going to be in just a few seconds.

3967
04:06:40,840 --> 04:06:55,100
but before that happens maybe there's something we can do
from here trick time okay swing oh so close oh so close ah

3968
04:06:55,100 --> 04:07:03,340
there we go chicken bone oh my god wait wait wait wait whoa
oh my god

3969
04:07:10,230 --> 04:07:12,190
I'm trying to get to the...

3970
04:07:12,190 --> 04:07:12,690
Ah!

3971
04:07:13,450 --> 04:07:14,570
There we go!

3972
04:07:19,140 --> 04:07:22,320
The bold body inspection!

3973
04:07:24,560 --> 04:07:24,820
Hello?

3974
04:07:25,580 --> 04:07:26,820
It looks like he's unconscious.

3975
04:07:28,740 --> 04:07:29,140
Excuse me.

3976
04:07:29,420 --> 04:07:31,040
Could you wake up for a second, please?

3977
04:07:32,300 --> 04:07:33,540
Pushy as ever, this detective.

3978
04:07:35,080 --> 04:07:40,400
One thing I've learned is that the most newly dead stay
unconscious for a little while at first.

3979
04:07:41,320 --> 04:07:41,500
Huh?

3980
04:07:42,200 --> 04:07:43,300
I was like that.

3981
04:07:43,320 --> 04:07:44,420
And you were like that, too.

3982
04:07:46,480 --> 04:07:47,520
Yeah, I guess you're right.

3983
04:07:48,640 --> 04:07:51,300
Anyway, if we restart the flow of time now, you'll die.

3984
04:07:52,260 --> 04:07:52,800
Yeah, I know.

3985
04:07:53,900 --> 04:07:56,460
Why don't we try going back even further in time?

3986
04:07:57,660 --> 04:07:58,920
Even further, but how?

3987
04:07:59,740 --> 04:08:00,120
Simple.

3988
04:08:00,400 --> 04:08:03,520
We go back four minutes before the death of this poor driver
here.

3989
04:08:06,340 --> 04:08:07,980
You can do that?

3990
04:08:08,140 --> 04:08:08,680
I guess?

3991
04:08:09,880 --> 04:08:10,360
Yeah!

3992
04:08:11,680 --> 04:08:12,940
I never tried it before.

3993
04:08:13,320 --> 04:08:14,720
So I don't know how it'll go.

3994
04:08:15,320 --> 04:08:20,800
But if we can erase the driver's death, that should erase
your death too.

3995
04:08:22,020 --> 04:08:22,760
Oh, wow.

3996
04:08:23,600 --> 04:08:25,020
I can't think of any other way.

3997
04:08:25,380 --> 04:08:26,100
Let's try it.

3998
04:08:28,620 --> 04:08:29,100
Rewind.

3999
04:08:31,680 --> 04:08:32,160
Oh

4000
04:08:40,440 --> 04:08:42,180
my god, it's this guy!

4001
04:08:43,520 --> 04:08:44,120
What the?

4002
04:08:44,580 --> 04:08:45,800
Yes, I remember!

4003
04:08:46,440 --> 04:08:47,960
Oh my gosh, the park!

4004
04:08:50,460 --> 04:08:51,820
That's Lynn, our rookie detective.

4005
04:08:52,880 --> 04:08:54,520
Is he the guy that phones the police station?

4006
04:08:55,100 --> 04:08:56,380
What's she doing at point X?

4007
04:08:56,900 --> 04:08:58,200
Could it be just a coincidence?

4008
04:09:01,980 --> 04:09:02,420
Um...

4009
04:09:03,060 --> 04:09:03,960
What was I gonna say?

4010
04:09:04,040 --> 04:09:05,520
Yeah, Parkman and Hippie Man!

4011
04:09:05,660 --> 04:09:05,980
Yeah!

4012
04:09:08,660 --> 04:09:10,420
Um, what was I gonna say, though?

4013
04:09:11,160 --> 04:09:11,880
I don't remember.

4014
04:09:14,780 --> 04:09:17,900
And we just got an APB on her a little while ago.

4015
04:09:18,220 --> 04:09:21,480
Something about an extremely important case is extremely
important.

4016
04:09:21,500 --> 04:09:24,380
witness currently extremely on the run.

4017
04:09:26,180 --> 04:09:26,460
Now what?

4018
04:09:26,580 --> 04:09:27,780
Should I report this to Inspector Calp?

4019
04:09:27,800 --> 04:09:29,240
Yes, yes, yes, he talks to him.

4020
04:09:29,860 --> 04:09:30,860
So he's the one that

4021
04:09:35,060 --> 04:09:35,860
signals him.

4022
04:09:36,480 --> 04:09:36,880
Aha!

4023
04:09:38,740 --> 04:09:40,400
Time to catch some sleep minto.

4024
04:09:40,520 --> 04:09:41,240
Enjoy the rest of the stream.

4025
04:09:41,340 --> 04:09:41,800
Thank you!

4026
04:09:42,180 --> 04:09:42,860
Good night!

4027
04:09:44,400 --> 04:09:46,900
They told us to stay off the radio unless it was an
emergency.

4028
04:09:47,400 --> 04:09:48,720
But I think I'd better call this in.

4029
04:09:49,920 --> 04:09:50,360
Poor Lynn.

4030
04:09:50,600 --> 04:09:51,820
I wonder what she did this time.

4031
04:09:52,180 --> 04:09:52,900
What do you mean me?

4032
04:09:53,420 --> 04:09:55,660
Spectre Cabanella is pretty protective when it comes to Lin.

4033
04:09:56,000 --> 04:09:56,740
He'd want to know.

4034
04:09:57,920 --> 04:10:00,260
I'm gonna finish up this case and then we'll end though.

4035
04:10:00,740 --> 04:10:03,100
So once we save this guy.

4036
04:10:05,800 --> 04:10:06,660
What's the matter?

4037
04:10:08,620 --> 04:10:09,120
Alright.

4038
04:10:09,480 --> 04:10:09,800
Fine.

4039
04:10:13,730 --> 04:10:14,770
Who called?

4040
04:10:20,070 --> 04:10:21,070
Who called?

4041
04:10:22,290 --> 04:10:25,290
And then we call people.

4042
04:10:25,790 --> 04:10:26,590
This is point X.

4043
04:10:28,950 --> 04:10:29,390
Idiot!

4044
04:10:30,610 --> 04:10:32,410
Oh, no, it's important!

4045
04:10:32,770 --> 04:10:33,290
Yes, sir.

4046
04:10:33,510 --> 04:10:34,190
Oh, go get her.

4047
04:10:34,370 --> 04:10:34,530
Okay.

4048
04:10:34,810 --> 04:10:37,330
I'm glad we got the cliff notes version of it.

4049
04:10:41,050 --> 04:10:42,290
Wee woo, wee woo!

4050
04:10:43,410 --> 04:10:45,450
The static is awful.

4051
04:10:46,830 --> 04:10:48,230
Um, eyes on the road, buddy.

4052
04:10:48,990 --> 04:10:51,050
Can't believe I forgot the trunk of all things.

4053
04:10:52,730 --> 04:10:53,070
Oh!

4054
04:10:54,950 --> 04:10:56,810
Such a small body, you probably only...

4055
04:10:56,830 --> 04:11:11,790
have a small bro he was listening he was listening in oh
that's what i love about you it was bugged i spy a ladybug

4056
04:11:14,790 --> 04:11:21,230
thank you for the don't know jason thunderburger that guy's
the total package

4057
04:11:25,720 --> 04:11:35,920
a ladybug i just hate little bugs it was bugged oh i can't
hear very well oh

4058
04:11:40,800 --> 04:11:44,140
so oh when she lit it on fire

4059
04:11:50,980 --> 04:11:56,880
dang i can't believe he crashed this is why you wear your
seat belts first of all i can't believe he crashed so

4060
04:11:56,880 --> 04:12:05,300
crazily that even though the steering wheel broke off rip
his eardrums this is this is you listening to be that's you

4061
04:12:05,300 --> 04:12:12,280
when you listen to vtuber stream sometimes isn't it you you
hear the scream and you're just like i'm being sent to

4062
04:12:12,280 --> 04:12:30,210
heaven the van driver looks like it looks like it i noticed
something though that conversation he was listening to just

4063
04:12:30,210 --> 04:12:33,230
before the crash i remember I remember hearing it before.

4064
04:12:34,730 --> 04:12:36,830
You're right, we heard it just a few minutes ago, didn't we?

4065
04:12:38,270 --> 04:12:39,890
One of your karaoke streams.

4066
04:12:40,510 --> 04:12:42,030
What do you mean by that?

4067
04:12:43,130 --> 04:12:45,890
I don't scream during my karaoke streams.

4068
04:12:46,190 --> 04:12:48,550
Are you saying that your ears are not blessed during my
karaoke?

4069
04:12:48,710 --> 04:12:50,030
Are you saying that I'm a shit singer?

4070
04:12:52,270 --> 04:12:52,790
Fine.

4071
04:12:53,770 --> 04:13:01,210
Everybody, you can thank Nine Breaker for me never doing
another karaoke stream ever again.

4072
04:13:05,250 --> 04:13:25,580
I'll never ever again get one guide just after that
conversation the detective suddenly passed out what happened

4073
04:13:25,580 --> 04:13:34,440
I wonder oh I know what happened we already know the answer
we saw what happened at the restaurant Yeah, she lit the

4074
04:13:34,440 --> 04:13:35,440
little bug on fire.

4075
04:13:38,220 --> 04:13:40,400
She burned up the ladybug.

4076
04:13:42,260 --> 04:13:45,920
Sometimes when a high-tech bug like that is destroyed, it
emits a loud signal.

4077
04:13:48,760 --> 04:13:50,700
I regret nothing.

4078
04:13:54,040 --> 04:13:55,120
I respect it.

4079
04:13:56,320 --> 04:14:00,700
He's like, if I go down, I'm going down with dignity.

4080
04:14:00,880 --> 04:14:01,280
You know what?

4081
04:14:01,500 --> 04:14:02,740
Stick to your ideals.

4082
04:14:04,800 --> 04:14:14,060
if that's what you believe then you know what don't just
don't just change your ideas because everybody else doesn't

4083
04:14:14,060 --> 04:14:30,060
agree with you that's your opinion he accomplished his
mission I I respect it stand proud

4084
04:14:35,400 --> 04:14:46,680
he's still getting lynched though no no i'm not wrong the
world is he basically said malice

4085
04:14:49,940 --> 04:14:59,420
uh so funny um find something to believe in right and even
if it's even if it's mince terrible

4086
04:15:04,320 --> 04:15:10,480
loud enough to knock a person out if they were listening to
it through headphones so that's why the detective passed out

4087
04:15:10,480 --> 04:15:15,380
huh bingo now let's stop it from happening

4088
04:15:24,140 --> 04:15:34,640
trick time oh oh i was like why was his soul there this is
the place that the white suited in your phone tonight.

4089
04:15:39,940 --> 04:15:43,520
This is a parking lot of the park on the east side of town.

4090
04:15:43,860 --> 04:15:44,580
It's been years.

4091
04:15:45,560 --> 04:15:46,200
You know this park?

4092
04:15:46,980 --> 04:15:48,640
Yeah, I used to play here a lot when I was little.

4093
04:15:49,380 --> 04:15:53,120
But then one day, I swore I'd never set foot in this park
ever again.

4094
04:15:53,860 --> 04:15:57,580
Because her father killed her mom.

4095
04:15:58,940 --> 04:16:01,100
Whoa, those are some really deep, dark feelings there.

4096
04:16:01,500 --> 04:16:02,160
I wonder what happened.

4097
04:16:03,640 --> 04:16:04,260
Hold it!

4098
04:16:05,620 --> 04:16:06,580
Don't give me that.

4099
04:16:06,740 --> 04:16:15,120
A ghost doesn't have a foot to set bit it's just a figure of
speech what kind of nitpicker do you think i am anyway

4100
04:16:15,120 --> 04:16:24,100
whatever let's get started okay let's do that i won't press
her about that other thing right now let's see we can go to

4101
04:16:24,100 --> 04:16:30,260
his flashlight we could go to a seat lover oh yeah let's put
that down

4102
04:16:35,520 --> 04:16:43,700
oh i guess we can uh flashlight we will we will Doesn't look
like the detective is going to come.

4103
04:16:45,960 --> 04:16:46,760
Thank God.

4104
04:16:47,580 --> 04:16:48,520
Might as well turn it off.

4105
04:16:48,660 --> 04:16:49,320
It's pretty loud.

4106
04:16:51,040 --> 04:16:51,840
Hold it.

4107
04:16:53,180 --> 04:16:54,840
What else can we get to?

4108
04:16:57,400 --> 04:16:58,720
Time is passing.

4109
04:16:59,820 --> 04:17:00,360
Oh, here he comes.

4110
04:17:00,480 --> 04:17:00,820
Here he comes.

4111
04:17:00,960 --> 04:17:02,240
And he's going to throw his binoculars.

4112
04:17:02,980 --> 04:17:04,980
And we can probably...

4113
04:17:04,980 --> 04:17:05,420
Yep.

4114
04:17:06,760 --> 04:17:08,140
Go to the binoculars.

4115
04:17:10,700 --> 04:17:13,020
They told us to stay off the radio unless it was an
emergency.

4116
04:17:13,480 --> 04:17:15,000
But I think I'd better call this in.

4117
04:17:16,600 --> 04:17:16,840
Poor Lynn.

4118
04:17:17,160 --> 04:17:18,300
I wonder what she did this time.

4119
04:17:19,440 --> 04:17:21,020
What does he mean this time?

4120
04:17:22,040 --> 04:17:22,980
Mind your own business.

4121
04:17:25,340 --> 04:17:27,560
I like to do things my way, okay?

4122
04:17:33,130 --> 04:17:36,210
Did she accidentally kill her dad?

4123
04:17:37,650 --> 04:17:38,310
Or her mom?

4124
04:17:40,850 --> 04:17:43,770
And that's why the guy...

4125
04:17:43,790 --> 04:17:48,630
in prison is wanting to take the fall

4126
04:17:52,490 --> 04:18:01,750
you know like what if she was a kid and she was just messing
around kind of like you know she was just messing around

4127
04:18:01,750 --> 04:18:09,790
with her like dad's her dad's a detective she just kind of
she's like I want to be like daddy too and she was playing

4128
04:18:09,790 --> 04:18:15,930
with the gun and it accidentally went off and killed her mom
and so that's why the dad was just like Oh my gosh.

4129
04:18:16,290 --> 04:18:17,890
I have to do the death penalty.

4130
04:18:22,810 --> 04:18:24,970
Because I can't let my daughter take the fall.

4131
04:18:25,070 --> 04:18:25,830
She was just a kid.

4132
04:18:30,270 --> 04:18:31,490
That's my current theory.

4133
04:18:32,490 --> 04:18:33,770
That's my current theory.

4134
04:18:36,030 --> 04:18:37,710
You got a cart before the horse.

4135
04:18:40,970 --> 04:18:41,390
Hmm.

4136
04:18:45,610 --> 04:18:46,030
That's...

4137
04:18:46,030 --> 04:18:46,450
Hmm.

4138
04:18:48,350 --> 04:18:51,530
Inspector Cabanela is pretty protective when it comes to
Lynn.

4139
04:18:51,850 --> 04:18:52,570
He'd want to know.

4140
04:18:53,670 --> 04:19:01,150
And because, like, because they're close, you know, like,
he's just like, he probably does not want her to become a

4141
04:19:01,150 --> 04:19:01,630
detective.

4142
04:19:02,470 --> 04:19:04,370
The Inspector Cabanela guy, right?

4143
04:19:07,250 --> 04:19:10,070
Because he's just like, you could, same thing could happen
to you.

4144
04:19:11,510 --> 04:19:13,490
But there's also the, all the other guys, too.

4145
04:19:13,950 --> 04:19:14,730
Hmm, I don't know.

4146
04:19:14,970 --> 04:19:15,550
I'm still cooking.

4147
04:19:15,830 --> 04:19:16,070
Oh!

4148
04:19:16,290 --> 04:19:16,410
Oh!

4149
04:19:25,370 --> 04:19:26,770
So why are we involved?

4150
04:19:27,230 --> 04:19:27,870
Good question.

4151
04:19:28,710 --> 04:19:29,330
Good question.

4152
04:19:32,670 --> 04:19:34,010
I'm cooking as all.

4153
04:19:35,070 --> 04:19:36,470
This is why I don't cook, okay?

4154
04:19:38,310 --> 04:19:39,810
Who is the detective talking to?

4155
04:19:40,490 --> 04:19:42,410
Don't keep yelling at me about these little things.

4156
04:19:44,010 --> 04:19:46,410
But they might be talking about something ridiculously
important.

4157
04:19:47,230 --> 04:19:50,350
That's true, but still, it might be the person who really
shot you.

4158
04:19:51,710 --> 04:19:53,470
Now you're just throwing things out there.

4159
04:19:54,110 --> 04:19:56,770
But in any case, it looks like it's too late to get to the
phone now.

4160
04:19:58,210 --> 04:19:58,750
I think we missed her.

4161
04:19:58,990 --> 04:20:00,010
But I didn't have a chance.

4162
04:20:00,090 --> 04:20:01,670
It didn't let me when he walked by.

4163
04:20:04,610 --> 04:20:07,210
I'm worried about that detective memory.

4164
04:20:08,910 --> 04:20:09,610
Who's the hell?

4165
04:20:09,750 --> 04:20:10,830
Who's detective memory?

4166
04:20:11,690 --> 04:20:15,050
They call her the Lynn of the Special Investigation Unit.

4167
04:20:16,530 --> 04:20:18,270
Is that a bad thing?

4168
04:20:20,030 --> 04:20:20,730
Well, well.

4169
04:20:20,830 --> 04:20:21,350
Did you hear that?

4170
04:20:24,470 --> 04:20:29,410
At least it's better than me being called the memory of the
detective division.

4171
04:20:31,110 --> 04:20:36,110
At any rate, I'd better report to Inspector Cabanella before
I worry about that listening device.

4172
04:20:42,470 --> 04:20:45,550
Yeah, see, when he's walking around.

4173
04:20:46,510 --> 04:20:47,950
I missed my chance.

4174
04:20:48,810 --> 04:20:49,390
Should I restart?

4175
04:20:51,990 --> 04:20:52,670
But...

4176
04:20:52,670 --> 04:20:53,490
Point X.

4177
04:20:54,990 --> 04:20:56,490
Chief here, did he show up?

4178
04:20:57,490 --> 04:20:58,490
No sir, not yet.

4179
04:20:58,770 --> 04:20:59,410
Blah blah blah!

4180
04:20:59,850 --> 04:21:01,050
I told you to stay off the radio.

4181
04:21:02,750 --> 04:21:03,810
Okay, this is important.

4182
04:21:04,450 --> 04:21:05,170
It's Lynn.

4183
04:21:06,350 --> 04:21:07,150
My baby.

4184
04:21:08,970 --> 04:21:10,130
What do you want me to do?

4185
04:21:10,610 --> 04:21:12,230
Get my baby away from point X.

4186
04:21:12,810 --> 04:21:13,970
Do it now, man!

4187
04:21:15,610 --> 04:21:16,010
Okay.

4188
04:21:22,860 --> 04:21:23,660
Now here.

4189
04:21:24,100 --> 04:21:24,940
He's on the move.

4190
04:21:25,760 --> 04:21:26,600
There isn't much time left.

4191
04:21:26,660 --> 04:21:27,840
We have to stop him fast.

4192
04:21:28,240 --> 04:21:30,240
Otherwise, he's going to crash into the chicken kitchen.

4193
04:21:31,560 --> 04:21:33,120
This is like that game, isn't it?

4194
04:21:33,740 --> 04:21:34,100
GTA?

4195
04:21:35,220 --> 04:21:36,160
Oh, game of chicken!

4196
04:21:38,120 --> 04:21:39,780
Sorry, but what's a game of chicken?

4197
04:21:40,840 --> 04:21:41,120
Sorry.

4198
04:21:41,760 --> 04:21:44,440
I'd better choose my audience more carefully the next time I
tell a joke.

4199
04:21:46,460 --> 04:21:46,960
Never mind that.

4200
04:21:47,220 --> 04:21:48,120
We have to do something.

4201
04:21:49,200 --> 04:21:50,900
Okay, let's put a seat down.

4202
04:21:51,900 --> 04:21:53,180
And if we do...

4203
04:21:53,180 --> 04:21:54,720
Yeah, we still can't reach.

4204
04:21:55,060 --> 04:21:56,780
If we put the seat down...

4205
04:21:58,020 --> 04:21:59,000
He will...

4206
04:21:59,000 --> 04:22:00,540
Maybe the headphones will fly off.

4207
04:22:01,300 --> 04:22:01,820
Recline!

4208
04:22:02,460 --> 04:22:02,980
Wow!

4209
04:22:04,780 --> 04:22:06,220
What do you think you're doing?

4210
04:22:12,860 --> 04:22:15,020
I just thought I'd do...

4211
04:22:15,020 --> 04:22:16,020
I'd better do something.

4212
04:22:16,380 --> 04:22:16,740
Never mind.

4213
04:22:17,060 --> 04:22:18,640
Hurry up and put the seat back up.

4214
04:22:18,960 --> 04:22:19,420
I can't.

4215
04:22:19,480 --> 04:22:20,300
It's too heavy.

4216
04:22:22,720 --> 04:22:24,240
How weak is this car?

4217
04:22:24,360 --> 04:22:26,460
Why does the steering wheel come off every time?

4218
04:22:26,980 --> 04:22:28,000
All I can hope is...

4219
04:22:28,020 --> 04:22:29,920
Yep, this guy has strong ab muscles.

4220
04:22:32,620 --> 04:22:35,160
Uh, I don't think he dies.

4221
04:22:39,510 --> 04:22:41,990
Somehow sped his death up.

4222
04:22:44,950 --> 04:22:46,450
Oh, time's up.

4223
04:22:47,190 --> 04:22:48,570
Oops, that was my bad.

4224
04:22:49,370 --> 04:22:52,610
I get that you felt like you had to do something, but that?

4225
04:22:53,690 --> 04:22:57,110
Well, there really isn't much I can do once the van is
moving.

4226
04:22:58,390 --> 04:22:59,410
We should rethink this.

4227
04:23:00,450 --> 04:23:01,770
Any other path before that?

4228
04:23:03,050 --> 04:23:04,370
Okay, from the beginning.

4229
04:23:04,710 --> 04:23:05,650
From the top, everybody.

4230
04:23:05,950 --> 04:23:06,410
From the top.

4231
04:23:08,230 --> 04:23:11,150
I, okay, can you think...

4232
04:23:11,150 --> 04:23:13,690
My logic wasn't so bad though.

4233
04:23:13,870 --> 04:23:14,170
Right.

4234
04:23:15,130 --> 04:23:18,190
My logic was pretty sound, I'd say.

4235
04:23:20,370 --> 04:23:21,170
Oh, that opened.

4236
04:23:21,230 --> 04:23:21,830
That's so cute.

4237
04:23:23,770 --> 04:23:24,290
What the?

4238
04:23:29,770 --> 04:23:32,230
It opens a little thing.

4239
04:23:33,190 --> 04:23:33,770
So cute.

4240
04:23:36,510 --> 04:23:48,870
was it though yeah I think I think I was how do I get over
there oh maybe I make a lot of noise and when he's trying to

4241
04:23:48,870 --> 04:23:53,270
listen yeah there we go he's like turning that blasted thing
off

4242
04:23:59,440 --> 04:24:07,740
oh ah

4243
04:24:12,700 --> 04:24:16,920
do the binoculars get launched by the seat ah Oh!

4244
04:24:19,940 --> 04:24:20,200
Pew!

4245
04:24:20,820 --> 04:24:21,140
Oh!

4246
04:24:22,160 --> 04:24:22,600
Phew!

4247
04:24:23,060 --> 04:24:23,360
Oh!

4248
04:24:24,380 --> 04:24:24,780
Uh.

4249
04:24:29,000 --> 04:24:29,300
Uh.

4250
04:24:30,720 --> 04:24:31,140
Uh.

4251
04:24:31,700 --> 04:24:31,760
Uh.

4252
04:24:46,380 --> 04:24:46,760
Uh.

4253
04:24:46,760 --> 04:24:47,100
Uh.

4254
04:24:47,100 --> 04:24:48,420
Did I do the wrong order?

4255
04:24:48,600 --> 04:24:49,280
Wait, what do you mean?

4256
04:24:53,370 --> 04:24:54,410
Just reset?

4257
04:24:54,610 --> 04:24:55,550
Okay, okay, I'll reset.

4258
04:25:01,650 --> 04:25:02,730
Uh, yeah, because we're going to reset.

4259
04:25:02,750 --> 04:25:03,950
We want to hear the phone call.

4260
04:25:06,650 --> 04:25:07,750
So he's gonna...

4261
04:25:07,750 --> 04:25:08,450
Okay, let's see.

4262
04:25:16,080 --> 04:25:16,760
What the?

4263
04:25:22,640 --> 04:25:23,520
I'm confused.

4264
04:25:23,760 --> 04:25:25,680
What's the order that I'm supposed to do?

4265
04:25:27,780 --> 04:25:29,740
But not kill her before siren.

4266
04:25:30,400 --> 04:25:30,440
Okay.

4267
04:25:35,000 --> 04:25:35,440
Phew!

4268
04:25:35,800 --> 04:25:37,340
Oh, and then he picks them up.

4269
04:25:38,140 --> 04:25:40,720
And then he carries them to the thing.

4270
04:25:40,860 --> 04:25:41,800
Okay, I think I get it.

4271
04:25:42,980 --> 04:25:47,200
Wee woo, wee woo, wee

4272
04:25:50,590 --> 04:25:50,590
woo!

4273
04:25:50,590 --> 04:25:50,950
Oh.

4274
04:25:53,330 --> 04:25:53,770
Yeah!

4275
04:25:54,690 --> 04:25:56,110
What are these doing here?

4276
04:25:57,170 --> 04:25:58,830
Wait, let me, let me, let me, let me!

4277
04:25:59,270 --> 04:25:59,550
Please!

4278
04:25:59,910 --> 04:26:00,450
There we go.

4279
04:26:02,650 --> 04:26:03,090
Okay.

4280
04:26:04,310 --> 04:26:05,550
Now we follow them.

4281
04:26:05,610 --> 04:26:06,150
Okay, okay.

4282
04:26:06,510 --> 04:26:07,450
Good, good, good, good, good.

4283
04:26:07,790 --> 04:26:08,230
Okay.

4284
04:26:10,110 --> 04:26:11,010
What's the matter?

4285
04:26:15,230 --> 04:26:16,050
Here we go.

4286
04:26:16,850 --> 04:26:17,370
Honk.

4287
04:26:22,010 --> 04:26:22,730
Detective Ridge?

4288
04:26:23,170 --> 04:26:24,030
This is memory.

4289
04:26:24,790 --> 04:26:27,190
Oh, she's memory.

4290
04:26:29,210 --> 04:26:30,330
Things been super tight.

4291
04:26:32,110 --> 04:26:32,970
What's the matter?

4292
04:26:33,230 --> 04:26:34,630
It's not time for your regular report.

4293
04:26:35,150 --> 04:26:36,070
Did she just miss me?

4294
04:26:36,970 --> 04:26:37,690
Listen to this.

4295
04:26:37,990 --> 04:26:40,190
There's a suspicious couple in the bar upstairs.

4296
04:26:41,030 --> 04:26:43,070
I'm going to put a ladybug on them.

4297
04:26:43,790 --> 04:26:44,470
A ladybug?

4298
04:26:44,870 --> 04:26:46,190
You mean a listening device?

4299
04:26:46,910 --> 04:26:48,570
Don't do anything to blow our cover.

4300
04:26:48,810 --> 04:26:50,830
Inspector Cabanella will be furious.

4301
04:26:52,330 --> 04:26:54,470
But they are doing all kinds of suspicious whispering.

4302
04:26:55,130 --> 04:26:56,870
We have to find out what they're saying.

4303
04:26:58,870 --> 04:27:00,610
You can pick up on the signal from your van.

4304
04:27:01,330 --> 04:27:03,310
Check out their conversation for me, would you?

4305
04:27:04,490 --> 04:27:05,530
All right, fine.

4306
04:27:06,130 --> 04:27:09,530
Once you get going on something, I know there's no stopping
you.

4307
04:27:09,670 --> 04:27:15,310
Okay, so we have to figure out a way for her to change the
position of the bug.

4308
04:27:15,510 --> 04:27:15,690
Okay.

4309
04:27:18,830 --> 04:27:19,730
Later then.

4310
04:27:20,230 --> 04:27:21,210
She's the murderer.

4311
04:27:22,230 --> 04:27:23,170
Hold on.

4312
04:27:23,570 --> 04:27:25,050
Did you see a customer come in just now?

4313
04:27:25,370 --> 04:27:27,150
A young woman with red hair and red boots?

4314
04:27:28,050 --> 04:27:30,030
Oh yeah, that restless, suspicious chick?

4315
04:27:30,270 --> 04:27:30,530
Sure.

4316
04:27:32,130 --> 04:27:32,610
Suspicious.

4317
04:27:33,530 --> 04:27:34,530
I mean, come on.

4318
04:27:34,810 --> 04:27:38,610
As soon as she sat down, she ordered three glasses of water
in a row.

4319
04:27:43,050 --> 04:27:45,790
And she spilled the second glass on the table.

4320
04:27:47,910 --> 04:27:48,610
Okay, fine.

4321
04:27:48,830 --> 04:27:50,250
Keep your eye on her, too, if you're...

4322
04:27:50,270 --> 04:27:59,050
would you got it oh wow that waitress was an undercover
agent and she apparently thought you were pretty suspicious

4323
04:27:59,050 --> 04:28:09,670
too oh yeah sorry I was really thirsty so you know no I
don't know anyway did you hear about what I heard about the

4324
04:28:09,670 --> 04:28:17,710
listening device we have to do something about that bug so
we have to stay here or follow up on the waitress looks like

4325
04:28:17,710 --> 04:28:18,870
it's time to make a decision

4326
04:28:23,130 --> 04:28:24,210
Go there!

4327
04:28:29,030 --> 04:28:32,190
Can't even be a dojiko without being called suspicious these
days.

4328
04:28:32,510 --> 04:28:34,270
Alright, SMH.

4329
04:28:36,470 --> 04:28:37,950
Okay, trace complete.

4330
04:28:39,590 --> 04:28:40,650
We're in the kitchen.

4331
04:28:41,450 --> 04:28:43,590
We're cooking for re- Whoa.

4332
04:28:44,270 --> 04:28:46,450
He just cooked the whole thing on a frying pan.

4333
04:28:47,810 --> 04:28:48,610
Look where we are!

4334
04:28:48,610 --> 04:28:51,290
The heart of the chicken kitchen.

4335
04:28:51,490 --> 04:28:53,030
I keep wanting to say the kitchen chicken.

4336
04:28:53,290 --> 04:28:54,590
I keep wanting to mix them up.

4337
04:28:55,430 --> 04:28:57,570
Whereas most people say the kitchen.

4338
04:29:14,650 --> 04:29:18,350
I hope the key to preventing that incident is here
somewhere.

4339
04:29:19,670 --> 04:29:20,590
Oh, I bet it will be.

4340
04:29:20,990 --> 04:29:21,830
You know what they say.

4341
04:29:22,350 --> 04:29:25,090
Where there's smoking chicken, there's fire.

4342
04:29:26,530 --> 04:29:29,590
Now that you mention it, it is pretty smoky in here.

4343
04:29:34,630 --> 04:29:43,750
let's see what we got in here we got a little t-shirt
scrunch and stretch a switch that we can turn on that's the

4344
04:29:43,750 --> 04:29:55,370
phone what does this do scrunch oh my god so cute a pie and
the kettle

4345
04:29:59,210 --> 04:30:02,970
rock that kettle oh rock that kettle Never mind.

4346
04:30:05,290 --> 04:30:06,090
Do you think that's...

4347
04:30:06,090 --> 04:30:07,550
Oh, she's doing it right now!

4348
04:30:09,190 --> 04:30:10,730
She's probably planting the ladybug.

4349
04:30:11,430 --> 04:30:16,170
Now that I think about it, it's this waitress's meddling
that starts the whole chain of events.

4350
04:30:18,830 --> 04:30:22,290
The detective wouldn't have gotten his ears blown out and
wouldn't have crashed.

4351
04:30:25,070 --> 04:30:27,250
In other words, we're witnessing it with our own eyes.

4352
04:30:27,630 --> 04:30:31,370
The cause of a huge disaster slowly being planted in a
chicken.

4353
04:30:33,490 --> 04:30:35,390
Hey, I just had a good idea.

4354
04:30:36,590 --> 04:30:37,750
The outfit reminds me of something.

4355
04:30:37,950 --> 04:30:41,470
It reminds me of the waitress outfit that Maya wears as
an...

4356
04:30:41,470 --> 04:30:43,430
Where is an ace attorney?

4357
04:30:44,550 --> 04:30:46,030
About what to do about the ladybug?

4358
04:30:47,910 --> 04:30:51,410
We could get her crushed under the chicken instead of me!

4359
04:30:52,530 --> 04:30:52,930
No!

4360
04:30:55,450 --> 04:30:57,150
I can't tell if you're kidding.

4361
04:30:57,670 --> 04:31:00,330
At any rate, now we've seen the root cause of the incident.

4362
04:31:02,830 --> 04:31:05,490
to do now is think of a way to take care of it.

4363
04:31:06,130 --> 04:31:08,390
Lynn is literally suggesting murder right now.

4364
04:31:11,010 --> 04:31:12,110
What is in his hat?

4365
04:31:13,790 --> 04:31:15,450
I think that's wine.

4366
04:31:15,630 --> 04:31:16,570
I think that's a bottle.

4367
04:31:18,750 --> 04:31:19,410
Oh my god, you guys.

4368
04:31:19,470 --> 04:31:23,090
If you ever start seeing Mataro wearing a suspiciously large
hat.

4369
04:31:26,720 --> 04:31:27,460
It's Remy.

4370
04:31:27,740 --> 04:31:29,420
No, it's not Remy.

4371
04:31:32,780 --> 04:31:33,620
I can't tell.

4372
04:31:39,550 --> 04:31:40,610
What's this switch?

4373
04:31:41,890 --> 04:31:42,990
It's smoky in here.

4374
04:31:43,750 --> 04:31:44,110
What's wrong?

4375
04:31:44,550 --> 04:31:45,790
I can't seem to raise this switch.

4376
04:31:45,950 --> 04:31:46,610
It won't budge.

4377
04:31:47,610 --> 04:31:50,870
Not surprising considering this whole place is sticky with
grease.

4378
04:31:51,610 --> 04:31:52,570
I bet it must be stuck.

4379
04:31:54,210 --> 04:31:55,190
It does feel pretty sticky.

4380
04:31:55,430 --> 04:31:56,050
It's orange?

4381
04:31:56,290 --> 04:31:56,890
It's alive?

4382
04:32:01,000 --> 04:32:02,340
What if the switch...

4383
04:32:02,340 --> 04:32:03,060
Wait, really?

4384
04:32:03,260 --> 04:32:03,420
Wait.

4385
04:32:03,980 --> 04:32:07,260
But if the switch were already raised, I bet I could manage
to lower it.

4386
04:32:09,340 --> 04:32:10,440
Oh, you're right.

4387
04:32:11,460 --> 04:32:12,660
What is in there?

4388
04:32:16,780 --> 04:32:17,820
What is in there?

4389
04:32:19,040 --> 04:32:20,220
What's in the hat?

4390
04:32:23,660 --> 04:32:24,940
Maybe it's his head?

4391
04:32:25,820 --> 04:32:26,700
Maybe he's got...

4392
04:32:26,700 --> 04:32:27,840
Remember the other guy that...

4393
04:32:27,840 --> 04:32:28,740
Maybe they're related.

4394
04:32:28,880 --> 04:32:31,200
Him and the other guy that likes the curry and chicken.

4395
04:32:33,660 --> 04:32:35,780
Him and the curry and chicken guy are related.

4396
04:32:45,750 --> 04:32:47,030
Oh, she's raising it.

4397
04:32:47,310 --> 04:32:48,210
Oh, one bad.

4398
04:32:50,510 --> 04:32:54,810
there we go and lift

4399
04:32:59,310 --> 04:33:10,670
nice oh wow it was really smoking in there and turn it off
she's still trying to bug that thing oh see I told you it

4400
04:33:10,670 --> 04:33:18,270
was a bottle you guys all said it was a rat you all said it
was a rat

4401
04:33:23,200 --> 04:33:31,640
uh Can I use, can I, I don't think I can attach, uh, oh,

4402
04:33:36,990 --> 04:33:39,890
I think I need to be on his hat so I can get to the lower
stuff.

4403
04:33:41,190 --> 04:33:41,850
Oh, maybe.

4404
04:33:43,410 --> 04:33:44,700
There we go, there we go.

4405
04:33:47,370 --> 04:33:48,610
Operating this, oh!

4406
04:33:54,220 --> 04:33:56,100
Hey, what's up with this lazy Susan?

4407
04:33:56,460 --> 04:33:57,280
It's acting up today.

4408
04:33:57,720 --> 04:34:00,280
Maybe it's out of sorts because I was spinning around.

4409
04:34:00,820 --> 04:34:01,840
Oh, I know what we need to do.

4410
04:34:01,860 --> 04:34:03,580
I know what we need to do.

4411
04:34:04,000 --> 04:34:05,200
We need to make it smoky.

4412
04:34:05,580 --> 04:34:08,280
While she's working on setting up the...

4413
04:34:08,280 --> 04:34:13,320
lifting the thing, we gotta switch it so she doesn't realize
that we switch them.

4414
04:34:15,120 --> 04:34:16,400
I get it now.

4415
04:34:16,700 --> 04:34:17,100
I get it.

4416
04:34:17,660 --> 04:34:18,440
I get it.

4417
04:34:18,520 --> 04:34:18,880
I get it.

4418
04:34:18,980 --> 04:34:19,360
I get it.

4419
04:34:20,080 --> 04:34:22,500
Okay, it's a matter of timing once again.

4420
04:34:23,400 --> 04:34:24,400
Oh, maybe it's out of sorts.

4421
04:34:25,300 --> 04:34:27,880
How about thinking maybe it might be broken?

4422
04:34:28,900 --> 04:34:30,180
But it really isn't broken.

4423
04:34:30,360 --> 04:34:31,240
It's just us ghosts.

4424
04:34:34,770 --> 04:34:36,270
Oh, we're stuck here though.

4425
04:34:36,490 --> 04:34:36,750
Uh-oh.

4426
04:34:37,570 --> 04:34:40,630
We're stuck here until we can get through.

4427
04:34:44,750 --> 04:34:44,990
Oh!

4428
04:34:46,870 --> 04:34:49,470
Uh-oh, I think I just did the timing bad.

4429
04:34:55,870 --> 04:34:57,030
Uh, alright.

4430
04:34:57,790 --> 04:35:03,810
So from here, um, we'll wait.

4431
04:35:03,910 --> 04:35:04,810
We'll wait in the hot.

4432
04:35:06,030 --> 04:35:06,690
Hopefully the timing...

4433
04:35:06,710 --> 04:35:07,530
Climbing works.

4434
04:35:09,250 --> 04:35:10,890
Hopefully it gets nice and stuffy.

4435
04:35:12,550 --> 04:35:13,930
It's smoky in here.

4436
04:35:14,370 --> 04:35:15,530
Okay, okay, okay.

4437
04:35:17,090 --> 04:35:17,650
Yes!

4438
04:35:19,090 --> 04:35:20,430
Alright, now we wait.

4439
04:35:23,690 --> 04:35:24,570
There we go!

4440
04:35:25,070 --> 04:35:25,870
Okay, that should be it.

4441
04:35:27,690 --> 04:35:28,610
That should be it.

4442
04:35:30,310 --> 04:35:34,730
Oh, I should be a detective, shouldn't I?

4443
04:35:35,910 --> 04:35:36,690
There, I'll say it.

4444
04:35:36,710 --> 04:35:40,510
nice there

4445
04:35:43,600 --> 04:35:50,440
how about that the ladybug is still sitting on the table we
did it

4446
04:35:57,190 --> 04:36:15,770
chicken thou art so beautiful chicken a chicken you just I
took a bite my heart swelled with pride and I got goosebumps

4447
04:36:18,310 --> 04:36:20,450
What the heck is this?

4448
04:36:21,110 --> 04:36:27,050
I'm consumed with the love of consuming you.

4449
04:36:30,210 --> 04:36:31,010
Chicken,

4450
04:36:36,090 --> 04:36:38,870
chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken.

4451
04:36:39,990 --> 04:36:44,050
Well, it looks like you've escaped the fate of being
hammered by your horrible head.

4452
04:36:46,550 --> 04:36:49,370
but I still haven't escaped the worst darkness of this
terrible night.

4453
04:36:50,670 --> 04:36:52,110
I shot you, didn't I?

4454
04:36:54,590 --> 04:36:58,290
Don't sing too much, you might shock the poor driver's ears.

4455
04:37:01,290 --> 04:37:03,830
Oh my god, I'm now the cause of the incident.

4456
04:37:05,250 --> 04:37:08,670
There must have been some sort of complicated set of
circumstances that made you do it.

4457
04:37:09,670 --> 04:37:12,630
It's never okay to shoot a person, no matter what the
circumstances.

4458
04:37:13,930 --> 04:37:16,530
Hey, shouldn't be that... Shouldn't that be my fault?

4459
04:37:16,550 --> 04:37:27,030
line but anyway you were investigating a case and I was
supposed to give you information on that case maybe it's

4460
04:37:27,030 --> 04:37:36,870
time you told me about it tell me about the case you're
looking into whoa yes I guess I should let's go back to the

4461
04:37:36,870 --> 04:37:43,190
new present first okay sure okay back to the present I

4462
04:37:53,240 --> 04:37:59,020
thought there would be music so I could drink my water Back
in the new present, the delicious aroma of chicken fills the

4463
04:37:59,020 --> 04:37:59,220
air.

4464
04:37:59,880 --> 04:38:01,120
But I'm still thinking about Lynn.

4465
04:38:03,260 --> 04:38:05,740
I wonder if she's still waiting for her chicken to be
served.

4466
04:38:06,460 --> 04:38:07,440
I decided to go see her.

4467
04:38:07,800 --> 04:38:11,280
See her and ask her the questions that were still consuming
me.

4468
04:38:11,820 --> 04:38:13,040
Not concerning you.

4469
04:38:13,820 --> 04:38:14,360
Consuming.

4470
04:38:15,580 --> 04:38:16,040
Bam.

4471
04:38:16,540 --> 04:38:19,880
I'm still stuck here until this guy decides to...

4472
04:38:22,040 --> 04:38:23,520
Until this guy...

4473
04:38:23,520 --> 04:38:24,420
I'm still...

4474
04:38:24,420 --> 04:38:24,920
Oh, there we go.

4475
04:38:31,230 --> 04:38:34,270
Uh, why is there even a button down here?

4476
04:38:37,580 --> 04:38:39,440
Um, the chicken kitchen?

4477
04:38:40,580 --> 04:38:42,340
Beem, beem, beem, beem, beem.

4478
04:38:48,790 --> 04:38:51,070
Okay, very gooed.

4479
04:38:53,030 --> 04:38:56,750
Like, if this was a cheese restaurant, I would have said,
very gooed, uh.

4480
04:38:58,130 --> 04:39:01,550
The disastrous accident has been completely erased.

4481
04:39:01,990 --> 04:39:04,910
Once again, I've saved the red-headed detective from death.

4482
04:39:05,750 --> 04:39:07,430
The criminal who stole my life.

4483
04:39:07,510 --> 04:39:09,250
And you saved another man's life, too.

4484
04:39:09,870 --> 04:39:11,590
Let's not forget about that as well.

4485
04:39:13,630 --> 04:39:16,210
But also, what were those guys doing upstairs?

4486
04:39:18,230 --> 04:39:18,710
Boo!

4487
04:39:19,430 --> 04:39:20,870
I know you guys would like it.

4488
04:39:20,910 --> 04:39:21,390
Thank you.

4489
04:39:21,450 --> 04:39:22,330
You guys are too kind.

4490
04:39:22,430 --> 04:39:22,850
Oh my gosh.

4491
04:39:23,670 --> 04:39:26,790
One question in particular hangs heavy on my mind.

4492
04:39:27,490 --> 04:39:28,590
Why did she shoot me?

4493
04:39:29,030 --> 04:39:31,350
Till I know the answer, I'll never be satisfied.

4494
04:39:34,270 --> 04:39:34,750
Oh!

4495
04:39:39,600 --> 04:39:42,260
Wait, maybe she's actually related to the other guy.

4496
04:39:46,020 --> 04:39:49,400
Meanwhile, Lynn's appetite is apparently foremost in her
mind.

4497
04:39:49,980 --> 04:39:52,440
A golden brown chicken sits on the table in front of her.

4498
04:39:52,900 --> 04:39:55,460
Until she eats the whole thing, she'll probably never be
satisfied.

4499
04:40:00,610 --> 04:40:01,770
Wait, how do we get over there?

4500
04:40:02,490 --> 04:40:04,670
Telephone book, menu board.

4501
04:40:11,160 --> 04:40:12,640
She's not holding onto anything.

4502
04:40:18,900 --> 04:40:21,120
Oh, I didn't know you were here, Dick, to range.

4503
04:40:22,020 --> 04:40:23,180
Come to see me, didn't you?

4504
04:40:24,360 --> 04:40:25,520
Oh, that's so sweet.

4505
04:40:27,480 --> 04:40:28,220
Oh, hi, memory.

4506
04:40:28,920 --> 04:40:30,060
Uh, don't mind us.

4507
04:40:30,480 --> 04:40:31,660
Just pretend we're not here.

4508
04:40:32,720 --> 04:40:35,060
Why don't you try some chicken while you're here?

4509
04:40:36,240 --> 04:40:36,740
No, thanks.

4510
04:40:36,940 --> 04:40:37,680
Oh, the water.

4511
04:40:37,760 --> 04:40:38,140
That's right.

4512
04:40:38,220 --> 04:40:39,520
I gotta do the water thingy.

4513
04:40:40,140 --> 04:40:42,180
Just watching Lynn eat is quite enough for me.

4514
04:40:44,080 --> 04:40:45,780
So, how to turn out?

4515
04:40:46,100 --> 04:40:46,900
With my ladybug.

4516
04:40:48,320 --> 04:40:48,640
device?

4517
04:40:48,980 --> 04:40:49,460
Well, let's see.

4518
04:40:49,840 --> 04:40:52,100
I thought the gentleman had a very nice singing voice.

4519
04:40:52,960 --> 04:40:54,580
Sorry, but we're in the middle of an important talk.

4520
04:40:54,980 --> 04:40:55,820
Could you leave us to it?

4521
04:40:57,320 --> 04:41:00,620
But you guys are the ones who call me over.

4522
04:41:03,640 --> 04:41:05,660
Yeah, we need her to be holding the pitcher.

4523
04:41:05,860 --> 04:41:06,340
Odd girl.

4524
04:41:06,860 --> 04:41:07,460
I agree.

4525
04:41:08,020 --> 04:41:08,520
Me too.

4526
04:41:13,280 --> 04:41:15,360
She needs to be oh wait, that's right.

4527
04:41:16,000 --> 04:41:17,380
One, two, three.

4528
04:41:19,620 --> 04:41:20,340
There it is.

4529
04:41:20,360 --> 04:41:39,070
did you decide you want some chicken or me oh miss memory
she's she flirts with anything that breeds we didn't call

4530
04:41:39,070 --> 04:41:46,990
you sorry but could you give us some privacy no stay right
there huh I'm at the crucial moment with this chicken here

4531
04:41:46,990 --> 04:41:50,750
I'll need you to pour me some water if it starts going down
wrong.

4532
04:41:51,850 --> 04:41:54,370
Lynn, you don't have to risk your life over chicken, you
know.

4533
04:41:55,010 --> 04:41:56,910
Oh my God, we're gonna have to save her from the chicken.

4534
04:41:57,430 --> 04:41:57,910
He's right.

4535
04:41:58,390 --> 04:41:59,830
Look at her attacking that thing.

4536
04:42:00,810 --> 04:42:03,050
I definitely want her calm down there, Momo.

4537
04:42:05,090 --> 04:42:06,350
Calm down there, okay?

4538
04:42:10,230 --> 04:42:12,910
Anyway, I better move now while I have the chance.

4539
04:42:13,410 --> 04:42:14,330
Trick time.

4540
04:42:16,370 --> 04:42:17,950
Oh, that's funny.

4541
04:42:19,930 --> 04:42:23,050
Even though I just saved that detective, he doesn't have a
core.

4542
04:42:25,550 --> 04:42:27,150
Not like the one Lynn had.

4543
04:42:27,510 --> 04:42:29,630
Or that valiant little doggy missile.

4544
04:42:30,270 --> 04:42:32,670
Maybe because he was unconscious, we couldn't talk to him.

4545
04:42:33,430 --> 04:42:36,470
I thought the ones I saved are supposed to develop a core
when they're alive again.

4546
04:42:38,210 --> 04:42:38,370
Hmm.

4547
04:42:39,010 --> 04:42:41,830
I guess I still have things to learn about these powers of
the dead.

4548
04:42:44,010 --> 04:42:45,490
Man has no soul.

4549
04:42:46,210 --> 04:42:47,170
I'm heading back now.

4550
04:42:47,370 --> 04:42:48,430
Lots of things to do, you know.

4551
04:42:49,690 --> 04:42:52,290
Yeah, like washing dishes and planting bugs.

4552
04:42:53,270 --> 04:42:55,950
Someday I'll plant a big one on you, detective.

4553
04:42:56,850 --> 04:42:57,370
Whoa!

4554
04:42:58,630 --> 04:42:59,790
She's so forward.

4555
04:43:00,590 --> 04:43:01,810
Goodness, girl.

4556
04:43:02,390 --> 04:43:02,970
Odd girl.

4557
04:43:03,410 --> 04:43:03,930
I agree.

4558
04:43:04,250 --> 04:43:04,810
Me too.

4559
04:43:08,770 --> 04:43:09,830
Bing, Bing.

4560
04:43:11,190 --> 04:43:12,070
Listen, Lynn.

4561
04:43:12,790 --> 04:43:14,410
You've explained your side and I understand.

4562
04:43:14,790 --> 04:43:16,610
But there's an APB out on you.

4563
04:43:17,950 --> 04:43:19,710
Can't you at least hurry up and get out of here?

4564
04:43:20,010 --> 04:43:20,310
You know.

4565
04:43:20,890 --> 04:43:30,590
away quietly me three no can do i'm meeting somebody here
meeting somebody oh yeah that's right the little lady

4566
04:43:30,590 --> 04:43:37,970
camilla but why do you have to meet somebody here the
special investigation unit is watching this restaurant now

4567
04:43:37,970 --> 04:43:47,910
how can that be a coincidence i don't know but it is a
coincidence yeah where is camilla hey is it true what they

4568
04:43:47,910 --> 04:43:52,890
say that you're still looking into Detective Jowd's case on
your own.

4569
04:43:56,810 --> 04:43:59,090
Inspector Cabanella is worried about you, you know.

4570
04:43:59,670 --> 04:44:03,270
I understand how you feel, but just don't do anything crazy,
okay?

4571
04:44:07,820 --> 04:44:08,860
Odd girl.

4572
04:44:10,740 --> 04:44:12,200
What is that supposed to mean?

4573
04:44:13,240 --> 04:44:14,960
Um, huh?

4574
04:44:19,260 --> 04:44:20,800
What is that supposed to mean?

4575
04:44:20,940 --> 04:44:22,980
Odd girl, pointing at me.

4576
04:44:36,620 --> 04:44:38,660
Time to invade her brain.

4577
04:44:40,260 --> 04:44:42,320
So how's that chicken you've been waiting so long for?

4578
04:44:43,160 --> 04:44:43,960
It's great!

4579
04:44:44,400 --> 04:44:45,420
It's great!

4580
04:44:47,560 --> 04:44:48,440
Chicken puff cereal.

4581
04:44:48,560 --> 04:44:48,880
No, wait.

4582
04:44:49,060 --> 04:44:50,200
That's Rishi's puffs.

4583
04:44:52,820 --> 04:44:53,940
Chicken for breakfast?

4584
04:44:54,360 --> 04:44:55,700
No, chicken puff cereal!

4585
04:44:56,200 --> 04:44:57,360
They're great!

4586
04:44:58,820 --> 04:45:04,320
But you know, with Detective Ringe, that's his name, by the
way, sitting right across from me.

4587
04:45:05,940 --> 04:45:08,340
I mean, he was just dead a few moments ago, right?

4588
04:45:08,960 --> 04:45:10,760
That's kind of taking the edge off my appetite.

4589
04:45:11,880 --> 04:45:12,680
Oh, brother.

4590
04:45:13,120 --> 04:45:14,420
This guy stinks.

4591
04:45:15,340 --> 04:45:16,300
But he's a great guy.

4592
04:45:16,460 --> 04:45:18,020
He understands my situation, he said.

4593
04:45:18,760 --> 04:45:19,780
You're thinking of Frosties.

4594
04:45:19,840 --> 04:45:21,020
I'm mixing them both up, okay?

4595
04:45:22,560 --> 04:45:24,240
I'm mixing everything up, okay?

4596
04:45:24,780 --> 04:45:25,600
I knew it.

4597
04:45:25,640 --> 04:45:26,320
I already know.

4598
04:45:26,640 --> 04:45:27,540
You don't have to tell me.

4599
04:45:29,220 --> 04:45:31,260
He's going to give me a pass just for tonight.

4600
04:45:32,080 --> 04:45:34,300
Speaking of Detective Ringe, I noticed something strange.

4601
04:45:34,620 --> 04:45:35,780
He doesn't have a core now.

4602
04:45:37,460 --> 04:45:38,260
He doesn't?

4603
04:45:39,100 --> 04:45:42,460
I thought a core was supposed to show up once I saved
somebody.

4604
04:45:43,300 --> 04:45:48,780
Hmm, I wonder if when he possessed his corpse, he was
unconscious, right?

4605
04:45:49,900 --> 04:45:50,700
Unconscious, yeah.

4606
04:45:51,200 --> 04:45:51,880
He was, wasn't he?

4607
04:45:52,500 --> 04:45:55,020
Just like you, you were unconscious the first time I saved
you, too.

4608
04:45:56,200 --> 04:45:57,800
After I saved you, you didn't have a core either.

4609
04:45:59,220 --> 04:46:00,060
So for people who are...

4610
04:46:00,060 --> 04:46:00,420
See?

4611
04:46:01,740 --> 04:46:02,960
I already called it.

4612
04:46:03,220 --> 04:46:10,220
For people who are unconscious, when you save them, no core
shows up i think that's probably what it is we had to save

4613
04:46:10,220 --> 04:46:18,580
her a second time before she regained her memory or regained
any sentience you might be right okay i'll leave range to

4614
04:46:18,580 --> 04:46:25,760
you then but i've still got lots of questions for you yeah i
thought you would she's just sitting here eating and like in

4615
04:46:25,760 --> 04:46:34,340
her thoughts talking with this ghost and the other
detective's like lynn lynn lynn lynn i know you really love

4616
04:46:34,340 --> 04:46:36,280
the chicken but you just gotta answer me, Lynn.

4617
04:46:36,700 --> 04:46:38,100
Lynn, just say anything, Lynn!

4618
04:46:39,900 --> 04:46:41,200
Let's get started then.

4619
04:46:41,660 --> 04:46:42,560
Oh, okay, right now?

4620
04:46:42,880 --> 04:46:42,880
Okay.

4621
04:46:44,360 --> 04:46:46,460
Let's start with bottom up again.

4622
04:46:46,880 --> 04:46:47,460
Bottoms up?

4623
04:46:48,480 --> 04:46:50,240
Sure it's taking Camilla long enough.

4624
04:46:50,940 --> 04:46:51,980
She should have been here by now.

4625
04:46:52,340 --> 04:46:53,260
I'm getting really worried.

4626
04:46:53,420 --> 04:46:53,820
Me too.

4627
04:46:55,120 --> 04:46:56,660
You two are like sisters, aren't you?

4628
04:46:57,020 --> 04:46:57,880
That's what Camilla said.

4629
04:46:58,660 --> 04:46:58,760
Yep.

4630
04:46:59,260 --> 04:47:00,460
That just about sums it up.

4631
04:47:01,440 --> 04:47:08,060
It doesn't look like being... It doesn't look like being
worried affected your appetite much though hey the bigger

4632
04:47:08,060 --> 04:47:16,260
the crisis the more a girl's gotta eat so true i have to
make sure camilla stays safe no matter what camilla and that

4633
04:47:16,260 --> 04:47:23,240
music box the music box oh my gosh we got that last time
it's been so long since we've heard about it oh yeah that

4634
04:47:23,240 --> 04:47:31,920
wooden box that one yeah That box was a present from
Detective Jowd.

4635
04:47:32,940 --> 04:47:33,420
Oh.

4636
04:47:37,220 --> 04:47:38,680
From Detective Jowd.

4637
04:47:40,140 --> 04:47:41,720
Yes, it was five years ago.

4638
04:47:42,160 --> 04:47:44,940
That box arrived three days after that murder incident.

4639
04:47:49,090 --> 04:47:50,530
Sorry, I was just cooking in my brain.

4640
04:47:51,670 --> 04:47:53,950
He must have sent it just before he was arrested.

4641
04:47:54,410 --> 04:48:01,690
I was like, what if once the detective went to jail, he
like, gave her away to another family and that's why her and

4642
04:48:01,690 --> 04:48:13,690
Camila are like sisters and like what if what if um Cicil
was the the father figure but she also didn't know who he

4643
04:48:13,690 --> 04:48:24,630
was so I guess that doesn't make sense hmm he must have sent
it just before he was arrested someday when the case is over

4644
04:48:24,630 --> 04:48:29,330
and everything is settled I want you to give this to a
certain person he said Ooh.

4645
04:48:30,050 --> 04:48:30,890
So what's inside?

4646
04:48:31,510 --> 04:48:31,870
Oh, no.

4647
04:48:31,990 --> 04:48:33,050
Was I the person?

4648
04:48:33,390 --> 04:48:34,450
Was Sizzle the person?

4649
04:48:35,350 --> 04:48:35,830
I don't know.

4650
04:48:35,950 --> 04:48:37,010
I can't open it.

4651
04:48:37,970 --> 04:48:37,970
Hmm.

4652
04:48:38,190 --> 04:48:38,870
That's a shame.

4653
04:48:40,470 --> 04:48:41,970
Yeah, she would have recognized him then.

4654
04:48:42,550 --> 04:48:42,570
Hmm.

4655
04:48:48,570 --> 04:48:50,030
She wouldn't have been that young.

4656
04:48:50,110 --> 04:48:51,050
It was only five years ago.

4657
04:48:51,670 --> 04:48:52,110
Oh.

4658
04:48:52,730 --> 04:48:53,770
I thought it happened.

4659
04:48:54,170 --> 04:48:55,370
I thought it happened a long time ago.

4660
04:48:56,030 --> 04:48:56,390
Oh, well.

4661
04:48:56,790 --> 04:48:59,110
Detective Ringe works for the Special Investigation Unit.

4662
04:49:01,590 --> 04:49:09,490

if Camilla's the one that shot the guy that's Camilla's dad

4663
04:49:09,490 --> 04:49:20,970
instead the deal that could affect the future of our nation
a nation isn't something that's easily influenced though but

4664
04:49:20,970 --> 04:49:30,710
that's what he said anyway it's that couple at the table
upstairs oh yeah I heard they're foreigners the wait they're

4665
04:49:30,710 --> 04:49:37,290

blue people country they're all just smurfs you guys they're

4667
04:49:51,050 --> 04:49:59,210
just big smurfs don't you know that like because there's so
much pollution that has happened the smurfs have mutated

4668
04:49:59,210 --> 04:50:01,710
into full-sized people.

4669
04:50:07,270 --> 04:50:08,190
Too

4670
04:50:13,010 --> 04:50:16,070
much raspberry slurpees country.

4671
04:50:19,290 --> 04:50:20,150
Are they still blue?

4672
04:50:21,930 --> 04:50:22,710
That's why they're blue.

4673
04:50:22,930 --> 04:50:25,890
They're just freakishly large smurfs now.

4674
04:50:27,050 --> 04:50:28,570
But average human size.

4675
04:50:29,390 --> 04:50:32,570
But freakish, really giant, large smurfs.

4676
04:50:32,890 --> 04:50:36,590
Every smurf with a giantest fetish is like, woohoo!

4677
04:50:36,730 --> 04:50:37,290
Yeah!

4678
04:50:38,190 --> 04:50:40,810
But every other Smurf is like, oh no!

4679
04:50:41,670 --> 04:50:44,450
Oh my god, this is ruining our lives.

4680
04:50:45,190 --> 04:50:46,530
We can't even go back home.

4681
04:50:46,710 --> 04:50:48,550
We just squish our families.

4682
04:50:49,130 --> 04:50:49,530
No!

4683
04:50:49,950 --> 04:50:51,010
That's what's happening.

4684
04:50:56,650 --> 04:50:58,890
It's kind of hard to imagine, isn't it?

4685
04:50:59,350 --> 04:51:01,770
The Smurfs, the Smurf population.

4686
04:51:02,410 --> 04:51:18,350
I'm sorry, my conversations nobody really knows any of the
details of the deal except for one person our favorite guy

4687
04:51:18,350 --> 04:51:19,550
mr.

4688
04:51:19,690 --> 04:51:26,970
breezy dancer in a white suit they say he's been watching
the movements he's been watching his movements of those two

4689
04:51:26,970 --> 04:51:36,770
for a long time I've never seen him work so frantically on
an investigation before Inspector Cabanella, eh?

4690
04:51:37,450 --> 04:51:39,230
Apparently, you're a real favorite of his.

4691
04:51:39,970 --> 04:51:40,430
The favorite?

4692
04:51:40,690 --> 04:51:42,230
Yes, well, there's a reason for that.

4693
04:51:43,170 --> 04:51:43,910
And what's that?

4694
04:51:46,110 --> 04:51:47,150
The reason?

4695
04:51:49,910 --> 04:51:52,610
Inspector Cabanella and Detective Jowd were good friends.

4696
04:51:54,270 --> 04:51:56,990
Yeah, I think I remember the prison guard saying something
about that.

4697
04:51:59,370 --> 04:52:01,030
Oh, my gosh!

4698
04:52:01,690 --> 04:52:02,210
Gumshoe!

4699
04:52:03,990 --> 04:52:06,110
Detective Division the very same day.

4700
04:52:07,370 --> 04:52:11,790
They're two very different types, but they were always in
friendly competition to be the best.

4701
04:52:14,910 --> 04:52:15,170
Oh!

4702
04:52:15,790 --> 04:52:16,750
A ba-ba-ba-ba!

4703
04:52:18,750 --> 04:52:23,690
Detective Jowd was always very particular about and thorough
investigation of the crime scene.

4704
04:52:24,830 --> 04:52:25,030
Yeah!

4705
04:52:25,350 --> 04:52:26,030
Oh, howie!

4706
04:52:27,350 --> 04:52:33,290
An inspector Cabanella, well, I guess he just has a natural
genius for investigating.

4707
04:52:33,990 --> 04:52:34,910
he's a cheater.

4708
04:52:37,230 --> 04:52:39,270
Other people do the work and he takes the credit.

4709
04:52:42,430 --> 04:52:45,670
those two led the detective division in those days.

4710
04:52:48,190 --> 04:52:51,330
Oh, but Inspector Cabanella is different now.

4711
04:52:51,810 --> 04:52:52,730
He changed a little.

4712
04:52:53,850 --> 04:52:54,630
He changed?

4713
04:52:55,450 --> 04:53:00,490
Ever since the detective Jowd incident, now he distances
himself from fieldwork.

4714
04:53:01,190 --> 04:53:03,830
And he's starting to focus on nothing but moving up the
ladder.

4715
04:53:06,130 --> 04:53:07,950
Well, maybe he's also trying to move...

4716
04:53:07,950 --> 04:53:09,310
I'm keep switching sides.

4717
04:53:09,470 --> 04:53:10,450
I'm like, he did it!

4718
04:53:10,690 --> 04:53:12,470
No, he's a good guy!

4719
04:53:12,770 --> 04:53:13,710
He's trying to...

4720
04:53:13,710 --> 04:53:15,790
He's framing him!

4721
04:53:16,170 --> 04:53:19,110
No, he's trying to find a way to get him out of jail!

4722
04:53:20,370 --> 04:53:23,850
Little A, but before I go to bed, I just want to say big
congrats on 200k!

4723
04:53:24,230 --> 04:53:25,490
Damn it, you're pretty good.

4724
04:53:25,670 --> 04:53:26,870
Thanks, Ghost of Me!

4725
04:53:27,830 --> 04:53:28,690
Ghost of Me?

4726
04:53:29,110 --> 04:53:29,830
Ghost of Ghost.

4727
04:53:30,350 --> 04:53:30,870
Good night!

4728
04:53:31,130 --> 04:53:31,810
Good night, good night.

4729
04:53:36,490 --> 04:53:41,850
now now I'm just like is he moving up the ladder because he
wants to be the top dog to not give that guy the death

4730
04:53:41,850 --> 04:53:52,600
penalty so that's how he became head of the special
investigation unit I take it anyway inspector Cabanela took

4731
04:53:52,600 --> 04:54:00,000
me under his wing because you were the little girl his good
friend had saved huh he really looked out for me helping me

4736
04:54:49,770 --> 04:54:55,910

4737
04:55:00,770 --> 04:55:12,750
i wasn't expecting nepotism what is going on all right death
row inmate joward to prisoner D-99, Detective Jowd.

4738
04:55:13,470 --> 04:55:15,290
He seems like more than just a co-worker.

4739
04:55:17,230 --> 04:55:19,010
Yes, I suppose you have the right to know.

4740
04:55:20,150 --> 04:55:21,790
Detective Jowd is my hero.

4741
04:55:24,090 --> 04:55:24,830
Hero, huh?

4742
04:55:25,170 --> 04:55:26,830
You don't hear that word much anymore?

4743
04:55:29,390 --> 04:55:31,090
She's cute so loud.

4744
04:55:32,350 --> 04:55:35,350
It's like finding out your doctor used chat GPT.

4745
04:55:35,630 --> 04:55:37,310
Oh, God, you're right.

4746
04:55:38,870 --> 04:55:43,710
It's like, oh, I just I just Googled it on WebMD, obviously.

4747
04:55:45,830 --> 04:55:48,570
It's an old-fashioned hero kind of story.

4748
04:55:49,130 --> 04:55:50,410
It happened 10 years ago.

4749
04:55:52,130 --> 04:55:54,030
Now just calm down and drop that weapon.

4750
04:55:54,970 --> 04:55:55,690
Stay back.

4751
04:55:56,030 --> 04:55:56,730
Have you got any closer?

4752
04:55:57,250 --> 04:55:58,370
I'll shoot her.

4753
04:56:06,710 --> 04:56:11,110
On that day, 10 years ago, I was playing in my favorite
park.

4754
04:56:12,590 --> 04:56:23,370
and then suddenly somebody grabbed my arm from behind I was
so scared I thought I was going to die and then

4755
04:56:27,670 --> 04:56:30,370
he appeared Detective Jowd

4756
04:56:36,620 --> 04:56:48,920
and then that really loud sound I think it was the sound of
a gun I passed out when I came to I Oh my gosh, he's a baby.

4757
04:56:51,060 --> 04:56:51,980
You're all right now.

4758
04:56:52,600 --> 04:56:53,200
Are you hurt?

4759
04:56:55,600 --> 04:56:57,080
You saved me, mister.

4760
04:56:57,920 --> 04:56:59,520
Oh my gosh, she woke up with a British accent.

4761
04:57:00,440 --> 04:57:01,680
I was just doing my job.

4762
04:57:02,720 --> 04:57:05,220
The gods, they're the ones who saved you.

4763
04:57:06,660 --> 04:57:08,080
What's your job, mister?

4764
04:57:09,340 --> 04:57:09,760
Me?

4765
04:57:10,200 --> 04:57:11,240
I'm a police detective.

4766
04:57:11,440 --> 04:57:12,060
What is that?

4767
04:57:12,260 --> 04:57:15,340
There was like, one of the, oh my gosh.

4768
04:57:15,900 --> 04:57:17,480
One of the...

4769
04:57:17,500 --> 04:57:26,600
I think it was like a movie recently the one with like
beatboxing puppy or whatever if you've heard of that like in

4770
04:57:26,600 --> 04:57:35,680
the beginning of the movie she has like a British accent and
then and then like as part of like the lore explanation she

4771
04:57:35,680 --> 04:57:46,780
was like when I when I when I grew up I lost my accent and
it was very clearly like they didn't want to pay another

4772
04:57:46,780 --> 04:57:52,020
another actor to do like a British accent when she wasn't
told or something.

4773
04:57:53,260 --> 04:57:55,060
Not the beatboxing puppy.

4774
04:57:58,660 --> 04:58:01,700
It's the same thing except opposite here.

4775
04:58:02,780 --> 04:58:05,820
She got scared so badly she developed a British accent.

4776
04:58:09,260 --> 04:58:10,880
That whole movie is literally AI.

4777
04:58:11,500 --> 04:58:13,040
I don't think it was though, wasn't it?

4778
04:58:13,160 --> 04:58:20,980
Like, apparently it was some YouTuber that had been, like,
creating it for a really long time and was, like, this is my

4779
04:58:20,980 --> 04:58:22,680
masterpiece movie!

4780
04:58:23,240 --> 04:58:24,800
But it was just not good movie.

4781
04:58:28,440 --> 04:58:29,700
Anyway, me?

4782
04:58:30,280 --> 04:58:31,440
I'm a police detective.

4783
04:58:35,600 --> 04:58:36,040
Okay.

4784
04:58:36,520 --> 04:58:38,540
So that's why he became a detective, huh?

4785
04:58:39,400 --> 04:58:40,020
That's right.

4786
04:58:40,240 --> 04:58:42,580
He was my ideal of what a detective was all about.

4787
04:58:45,000 --> 04:58:46,720
shoot and kill his own wife.

4788
04:58:47,000 --> 04:58:47,200
True.

4789
04:58:51,740 --> 04:58:52,520
Mm-mm.

4790
04:58:53,580 --> 04:58:54,980
That's why I didn't want...

4791
04:58:54,980 --> 04:58:57,520
That's why I went to prove that he didn't.

4792
04:58:59,920 --> 04:59:00,880
Cicel, I...

4793
04:59:00,880 --> 04:59:02,480
Did I really shoot you?

4794
04:59:02,820 --> 04:59:03,520
Oh my gosh.

4795
04:59:05,260 --> 04:59:06,560
She is just like her hero.

4796
04:59:09,840 --> 04:59:11,140
Where did that come from?

4797
04:59:11,200 --> 04:59:11,880
Out of the blue.

4798
04:59:12,680 --> 04:59:13,760
I really don't remember.

4799
04:59:15,000 --> 04:59:23,120
and tried but i just can't now i finally understand how you
must feel and how hard it is to have your memory gone your

4800
04:59:23,120 --> 04:59:31,580
story erased but who knows knowing the truth might be even
harder i'd rather believe there's hope myself

4801
04:59:35,720 --> 04:59:45,100
nice we should almost be done with this chapter though right
oh dang she ate the whole thing that was great do I have

4802
04:59:45,100 --> 04:59:51,860
chicken on my face you're staring I bet you're thinking
about how impressed you are with the way I took care of that

4803
04:59:51,860 --> 04:59:59,900
chicken just tell me one thing this case you say you're
looking into is it detective jowds

4804
05:00:04,290 --> 05:00:14,090
what if it was I can't keep it from you it's too cruel uh oh
no he's about to die before he tells us the information.

4805
05:00:15,190 --> 05:00:16,770
What are you talking about?

4806
05:00:17,790 --> 05:00:18,270
I'm sorry, Lynn.

4807
05:00:18,830 --> 05:00:19,690
It's tonight.

4808
05:00:20,870 --> 05:00:21,990
Oh, okay, okay.

4809
05:00:22,310 --> 05:00:22,430
Never mind.

4810
05:00:23,050 --> 05:00:23,630
His execution.

4811
05:00:24,030 --> 05:00:24,870
Detective Jowds, you know.

4812
05:00:25,690 --> 05:00:26,310
It's tonight.

4813
05:00:27,090 --> 05:00:27,810
His execution.

4814
05:00:30,570 --> 05:00:31,910
But there's still time.

4815
05:00:32,630 --> 05:00:37,830
I looked into it and I found out all the executions in this
country are carried out at dawn.

4816
05:00:39,210 --> 05:00:40,970
That may be the norm, but...

4817
05:00:42,490 --> 05:00:54,290
this time i'm afraid what the execution is set for 11 p.m oh
my gosh wasn't it nine what did you say it's going to happen

4818
05:00:54,290 --> 05:01:08,490

course not it's too late now not without a stay of execution

4819
05:01:08,490 --> 05:01:21,130
from the justice minister going to see him then what see who

yet another person is connected to some I'm connected to is
somehow about to end tonight.

4826
05:02:11,930 --> 05:02:12,690
Could it be a coincidence?

4827
05:02:13,430 --> 05:02:14,970
Or is there something more behind it all?

4828
05:02:17,270 --> 05:02:19,190
Detective Jowd is destined to be executed tonight.

4829
05:02:19,990 --> 05:02:23,410
I don't know if that fate is the wrong one for him or the
right one.

4830
05:02:24,050 --> 05:02:25,870
But I've decided to go to the prison anyway.

4831
05:02:31,050 --> 05:02:31,430
Okay.

4832
05:02:35,900 --> 05:02:36,680

So probably two, three more streams.

4859
05:04:01,440 --> 05:04:02,600
I'm going to aim for two, though.

4860
05:04:02,640 --> 05:04:03,360
I'm going to aim for two.

4861
05:04:03,440 --> 05:04:06,020
I would like to finish it before I leave for...

4862
05:04:06,020 --> 05:04:08,080

uh

4886
05:05:19,400 --> 05:05:25,400
Shashingo which if you're not aware of what that game is
it's basically a game where you take pictures and learn

4887
05:05:25,400 --> 05:05:28,020
stuff in Japanese So we can learn Nihon go

4888
05:05:32,880 --> 05:05:33,920
Yeah, fake me.

4889
05:05:33,960 --> 05:05:36,400

You too You too you too.

4893
05:05:43,240 --> 05:05:50,980
Yeah, so I was wondering if you've listened to Atarashi
Gakko.

4894
05:05:52,340 --> 05:05:54,360
I know they're not really the typical idol group, just
wondering.

4895
05:05:54,460 --> 05:05:56,440
I have, I have listened to them a little bit.

4896
05:05:56,880 --> 05:05:57,520
Thanks for the Superjack!

4897
05:05:57,620 --> 05:05:58,980
Congrats on 200k, thank you!

4898
05:06:00,720 --> 05:06:02,900
Actually, I, um...

4899
05:06:02,900 --> 05:06:05,600
Oh my gosh, I have pictures from an old...

4900
05:06:05,600 --> 05:06:06,420
Let me see.

4901
05:06:06,940 --> 05:06:09,560
I have to check how long ago this was.

4902
05:06:10,560 --> 05:06:13,260
Um, that I didn't realize it was...

4903
05:06:13,260 --> 05:06:23,480
Like, I had, I had gotten to the exhibit for something else,
but it was a collaboration with them as well.

4904
05:06:23,940 --> 05:06:25,520
It was like them and another brand.

4905
05:06:26,980 --> 05:06:28,100
Back in...

4906
05:06:30,080 --> 05:06:31,540
I'm looking through my pictures.

4907
05:06:34,620 --> 05:06:35,580
Oh, wait.

4908
05:06:36,040 --> 05:06:39,840
I posted the picture in 2016, but it said throwback.

4909
05:06:43,360 --> 05:06:55,220
I'm not sure when I posted the picture it says throwback so
actually I don't know at all when this it might have been

4910
05:06:55,220 --> 05:07:04,520
2016 that sounds right um but yeah so I've known about them
for a while but so it's really crazy to see that they but I

4911
05:07:04,520 --> 05:07:09,880
never listened to them back then I was never like a huge fan
but it's really crazy to see how popular they've become now

4912
05:07:09,880 --> 05:07:15,180
they're like everywhere Eight years ago.

4913
05:07:15,580 --> 05:07:16,220
Yeah, right?

4914
05:07:20,060 --> 05:07:20,460
Okay.

4915
05:07:21,080 --> 05:07:23,820
I'm going to go rest you guys as well.

4916
05:07:25,180 --> 05:07:26,760
I'll try to wear Ace Combat merch at Off-Kai.

4917
05:07:26,920 --> 05:07:27,580
I hope you will see you.

4918
05:07:27,800 --> 05:07:30,620
But if unable to meet you during meet and greet...

4919
05:07:30,620 --> 05:07:33,260
Or unable to see you, I will post my merch on Twitter
after...

4920
05:07:33,260 --> 05:07:33,640
Yeah!

4921
05:07:33,820 --> 05:07:34,320
Post it!

4922
05:07:34,340 --> 05:07:35,100
Post it!

4923
05:07:35,300 --> 05:07:37,020
I will be at Off-Kai.

4924
05:07:37,900 --> 05:07:38,020
B.

4925
05:07:38,060 --> 05:07:42,320
Shojo is very kind enough to let me be in one of the little
robots as well.

4926
05:07:43,260 --> 05:07:49,980
Um, Matara and I will be going around in our robots and, um,
uh, if you don't get a meet and greet, um, if you can't go

4927
05:07:49,980 --> 05:07:52,760
to the con, uh, sorry.

4928
05:07:54,380 --> 05:08:04,080
But if we don't get a meet and greet at the, at the con, um,
we will be, we'll be also going around as well, so, um, they

4929
05:08:04,080 --> 05:08:04,780
sold out.

4930
05:08:05,840 --> 05:08:08,620
What the, the meet and greets?

4931
05:08:15,130 --> 05:08:16,190
The meet and greets?

4932
05:08:18,330 --> 05:08:20,330
Oh, the Khan sold out.

4933
05:08:23,830 --> 05:08:26,890
I was going to say, I don't think the meet and greets are
sold.

4934
05:08:27,110 --> 05:08:27,750
They're a lottery.

4935
05:08:32,930 --> 05:08:40,510
But also, if you can't make it to Off Kai, maybe another
time and place.

4936
05:08:42,010 --> 05:08:42,230
Hopefully.

4937
05:08:43,250 --> 05:08:44,410
We'll do our best.

4938
05:08:46,050 --> 05:08:46,890
We'll do our best.

4939
05:08:47,050 --> 05:08:47,490
We'll do our best.

4940
05:08:48,390 --> 05:08:48,810
Yeah.

4941
05:08:53,120 --> 05:08:53,540
Um.

4942
05:08:54,400 --> 05:08:54,940

Uh, eventually.

4947
05:09:05,720 --> 05:09:08,180
Can you and Matara do like battle bots and fight each other?

4948
05:09:08,280 --> 05:09:09,100
I sure hope so.

4949
05:09:10,180 --> 05:09:13,860
I demand Mint to fly to our houses in drone form for all the
people who missed it.
