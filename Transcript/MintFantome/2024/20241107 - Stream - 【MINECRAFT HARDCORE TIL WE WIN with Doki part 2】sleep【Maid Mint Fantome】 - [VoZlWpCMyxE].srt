1
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,770
I think you need more sleep than me.

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,950
I'm starting my next stream now.

3
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,250
I started my...

4
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,730
I accidentally...

5
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,530
It's fine.

6
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,490
It's fine.

7
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,430
I started my stream.

8
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,310
I started my next stream.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,310
I...

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,070
Oh my god, okay.

11
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,310
Alright, have fun live.

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,010
Sorry guys, I accidentally raided this stream.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,610
I accidentally raided.

14
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,430
Oh my god.

15
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,710
Alright, we're doing the...

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,850
Should we chat our stuff first or should we raid now?

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,730
Should we do the pillaging?

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,230
We probably don't need to do the pillaging.

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,090
Hold on, I have so many DMs real quick.

20
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:03,670
Hold on.

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,490
Okay, guys, I accidentally raided Minstream instead of my own stream.

22
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,050
Hold on, I have so many DMs.

23
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,490
Hold on.

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,790
Okay, okay.

25
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,200
Ugh.

26
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,760
Someone said the pillager is not worth the risk.

27
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,960
Okay, let's just enchant stuff then.

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
You work on enchanting.

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,540
I'm just gonna work on...

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,380
Um, do you want the...

31
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,760
I'll put the enderpearls in your chest.

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,200
And then I'll put the books in your...

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,660
Do you want me to make bookshelves now?

34
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,640
I can make it now.

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,000
Um, hold on.

36
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,520
Oh god, wait.

37
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,980
How many bookshelves do we need?

38
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,400
Um, I don't know.

39
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,100
Guys, how many do we need for the enchanting table?

40
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,720
Oh yeah, how many do we need?

41
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,400
You have more.

42
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,760
You can get past the books to me and I'll make them.

43
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,020
Yeah, I have that many.

44
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,360
15.

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,320
Oh my god!

46
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,340
Okay, we have enough.

47
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,640
Yeah, we have so many.

48
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,620
15?

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,740
Okay, we have...

50
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,260
But we still need books for...

51
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,620
For the enchanting stuff.

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,440
So...

53
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,120
Oh, I see it.

54
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,060
Okay, 15.

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,220
So, we have 9 right now.

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,020
I'm gonna go farm some more trees real quick.

57
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,700
Oh, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep!

58
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,040
I'mma sleep in my bed.

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,380
I'mma sleep too.

60
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,840
I'mma sleep as well.

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,820
Guys, we have one life.

62
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,080
If we don't do this, it's over.

63
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,180
We'll try this again another time.

64
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,820
Try what?

65
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,620
What are we trying?

66
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,500
If we fuck it up.

67
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,940
We have one life to make this happen.

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,520
One life to make what happen?

69
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,240
What's happening?

70
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,000
The Ender Dragon.

71
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,300
We have one life.

72
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,220
We have one life to make this work.

73
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,340
Oh, chat is frozen.

74
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,120
Thank you guys.

75
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,020
Thank you for letting...

76
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,020
I forgot to change my chat overlay as well.

77
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Thank you, me too.

78
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,280
Sorry guys, we just came right back into it.

79
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,480
We just came right back.

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
One life to make it all work.

81
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,340
Ender Dragon.

82
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,380
Alright.

83
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,100
Okay, I got the wood.

84
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,590
Okay.

85
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,210
Okay, I got it.

86
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,170
I got it.

87
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,770
I got enough for...

88
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,370
I think I got enough for bookshelves.

89
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:41,870
Yeah, I do.

90
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,430
I do.

91
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,230
We got this.

92
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:51,830
Wood.

93
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,190
And then I should have...

94
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,270
I should have enough for 15.

95
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,670
Let's see.

96
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,710
Let's see.

97
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,470
Bookshelf.

98
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,340
You know what I think might happen?

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,160
What?

100
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,100
What?

101
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,100
I won't be surprised if...

102
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,900
Just there.

103
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,340
Just there.

104
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,420
What?

105
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,960
What do you mean by that?

106
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,100
Just there.

107
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,720
Do you think we're gonna die?

108
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,060
No, no, no, no.

109
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,540
No, no, no.

110
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,500
We're not.

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,960
We can do this.

112
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,040
Oh, we need glass.

113
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,460
So I need to get...

114
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:39,700
Sand.

115
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,020
Sand is right next to us.

116
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,260
Oh, what's the glass for?

117
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,640
The potion bottles?

118
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,120
Yeah.

119
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,560
Is that what else you need to make?

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,280
Potion bottles.

121
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,680
I haven't unlocked it, so I don't know yet.

122
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,720
I think that's it.

123
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,520
I think it's just glass.

124
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,500
Oh, we just need to get glass, and then...

125
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,780
We had so many empty bottles, too.

126
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,820
And we threw it all away.

127
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,720
It's fine.

128
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,380
We didn't need it.

129
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,080
Okay.

130
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,260
It's fine.

131
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,760
But they don't stack.

132
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,240
So it sucks.

133
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,500
That's true.

134
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,240
That's true.

135
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,420
13.

136
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,540
14.

137
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,220
I have 15.

138
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,640
And we have 38 books, too.

139
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,560
15.

140
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,580
Yeah, I'll put the bookshelves...

141
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,820
I'll put the bookshelves with you.

142
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,440
Okay.

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,540
I can help you with glass, too.

144
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,060
What else do I need for the bottle?

145
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,760
Oh, I need to make the glass.

146
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,200
Give me the shovel.

147
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,800
I'll get glass, and then you can work on enchanting table and stuff.

148
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,300
Do you have any...

149
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,220
Coal?

150
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,360
I do.

151
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,300
It's in my other box.

152
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,140
It's in my other chest.

153
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,120
Give me the glass, and I'll...

154
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,560
I'll dig, like...

155
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,380
Dig the sand, and then you work on enchanting table.

156
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:52,760
Okay.

157
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,200
Alright.

158
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,220
I mean, sand is literally right here.

159
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,660
Yeah, just get some.

160
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,940
Yeah, just grab some.

161
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,700
Oh, I need to make space for the...

162
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,340
We're being...

163
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,500
We're teamwork.

164
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,700
Teamwork.

165
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,480
Teamwork.

166
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,160
Teamwork right here.

167
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,580
Teamwork right here.

168
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,300
Teamwork makes the dream work.

169
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,680
Right here.

170
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,160
Okay.

171
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,580
I got...

172
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,640
46.

173
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,400
I think 46 is enough.

174
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,940
Probably, yeah.

175
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,820
Yeah, yeah.

176
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,740
I'll start burning the glass.

177
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,660
Yeah.

178
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,080
Burn it up, baby.

179
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,840
Burn it up.

180
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,360
Does the blast furnace work with sand?

181
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,740
I don't think so.

182
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,260
Wait, does it not?

183
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,460
No, it does not.

184
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:44,780
Okay.

185
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,500
Someone said, what if the end portal is 12 blocks...

186
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,000
12k blocks away?

187
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,700
Don't say that.

188
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,780
There's no way.

189
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,640
We don't have Elijah's?

190
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,260
Don't say that.

191
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,860
Please.

192
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,640
If it's too far, we're calling it.

193
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,720
We're going in here.

194
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,360
So we just need the 15 bookshelves around, right?

195
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,200
Okay, that's all it is.

196
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,880
Yeah, just surround it.

197
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,860
Okay, I'm making this stuff.

198
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,240
Just like that, right, guys?

199
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,480
I think so, yeah.

200
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,260
Like that.

201
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,500
And you put the...

202
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,720
Thing in the middle, yeah.

203
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,100
Is it?

204
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,340
Is it?

205
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,440
Did it work?

206
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,300
Yeah, now we need the lapis.

207
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,280
Not the corners?

208
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,460
It's fine.

209
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,920
I have...

210
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,380
Here, let me see it.

211
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,120
62.

212
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,780
How many levels do you have?

213
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,080
Um...

214
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,560
30?

215
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,080
35?

216
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,720
You can get knockback...

217
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,060
Yeah, it goes all the way to 3.

218
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,840
Enchantment, knockback...

219
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,140
Smite...

220
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,740
Here's...

221
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,620
I can enchant the bow, actually.

222
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:18,940
Power!

223
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,540
I should get that, right, for the bow?

224
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,500
That's for the bow, right?

225
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

226
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,580
I'll put that for the bow then, right?

227
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,760
Right?

228
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,640
Is that right, guys?

229
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,680
Oh yeah, infinity on the bow would be so good.

230
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,040
Okay.

231
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,860
Also, it goes to unbreaking 3.

232
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,020
So we're good, guys.

233
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,300
I have power 4 on my bow.

234
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,100
Should I do unbreaking on my sword?

235
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,080
I can't remember what the enchantments are.

236
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,700
I can just...

237
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,960
I'm just gonna...

238
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,000
If we have a bad...

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
If we have bad luck...

240
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,920
Where's the rest of the books?

241
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,660
Here, I put the rest of the books here.

242
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,020
Okay, we can just put some...

243
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,620
On your right side.

244
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,500
Yeah, I got them.

245
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,860
We can just reset with this.

246
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,780
I need anvil.

247
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,080
You have all my iron, right?

248
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,540
Oh yeah, here you go.

249
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,780
Oh, blast protection!

250
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,560
That's good, that's good.

251
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,520
Hold on.

252
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,680
Here you go.

253
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,200
There you go.

254
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,600
Oh, 32.

255
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,740
That's enough for an anvil.

256
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:30,900
Oh, armor enchant.

257
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,860
Yeah, thank you, guys.

258
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,760
Armor enchant.

259
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,740
Anvil...

260
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,240
Wait, how do I make an anvil?

261
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,120
Blast protection 4 is good, right?

262
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,410
No, it's not good.

263
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,250
Wait, feather falling.

264
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,310
We need feather falling.

265
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,530
Oh, let me check my boots.

266
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,150
How do I make anvil again?

267
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,230
Iron blocks?

268
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,510
How many do I need?

269
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,290
Yeah, you need some iron blocks.

270
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,410
Okay, 3.

271
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,310
Okay, I have enough.

272
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,010
3.

273
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:01,750
Oh.

274
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,570
Oh.

275
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,230
Oh.

276
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,490
Oh, I do.

277
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,470
I just had enough.

278
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,010
That's good.

279
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,670
Alright.

280
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,690
I just had enough for an anvil.

281
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,350
Flat protection is best.

282
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:12,710
Okay.

283
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,170
I only have protection 1.

284
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,730
Okay, what else can we get?

285
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,890
Let's try our helmet instead.

286
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,450
6.

287
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,810
I'm breaking, I'm breaking.

288
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,470
Projectile protection.

289
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,090
Fix my bow.

290
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,530
Yeah, let's check the bow.

291
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,350
Let's try the bow.

292
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,590
Power 4.

293
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,230
Power 4 would be good on the bow, right?

294
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,330
Yeah, it would be good.

295
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:41,790
Okay.

296
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,770
Here we go.

297
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,230
Oh, I also got extra unbreaking on it.

298
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:50,530
Cool.

299
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,190
Oh, nice.

300
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,870
Okay, I need to take my shoes off.

301
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,770
Okay, cool.

302
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:56,690
Deathstrider.

303
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,410
Oh, projectile protection.

304
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,130
Just explain how I'm too tired to think.

305
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,650
Projectile...

306
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,410
I don't know, do we need...

307
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,630
No, just say...

308
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,690
They all said normal protection is better than projectile.

309
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,370
Yeah, but my thing doesn't make that.

310
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,110
Well, just do something else.

311
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,850
And then you can unlock...

312
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,710
Unbreaking 3.

313
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,010
Well, I got protection 3 on my boots.

314
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,790
That should be good.

315
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,910
Unbreaking 3.

316
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,390
Oh, I don't have...

317
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,290
Protect 3.

318
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,770
Okay, thanks, guys.

319
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,710
Where's my pants?

320
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,310
Unbreaking 3, protection 2.

321
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,170
Oh, I have protection 2.

322
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,150
I'm gonna get protection 2.

323
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,550
Oh, wait.

324
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,710
Oh, I can't do more on my boots.

325
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,290
No, we don't have enough XP.

326
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,890
We should be fine, right?

327
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,450
What XP do you need?

328
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,790
Oh, I don't...

329
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,070
Oh, I need...

330
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,410
Sharpness and sweeping edge.

331
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,770
Let me see what I have.

332
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,310
How do I combine?

333
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,290
What do I do?

334
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,270
You put...

335
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,370
I didn't realize my glasses were on.

336
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:11,650
What glasses?

337
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,690
No, I have protection 3 for my chest.

338
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,430
I need that.

339
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,070
You have sharpness?

340
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,210
Oh, I'm just gonna get sharpness.

341
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,510
Fuck it, I'm just gonna...

342
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,910
I'm gonna kill something.

343
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,510
I'm gonna kill something.

344
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,690
It might be me.

345
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:34,170
What do I have on my head?

346
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,490
Fire protection, respiration.

347
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,610
Why are they all such shitty levels?

348
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,490
Okay.

349
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,750
I'm just gonna commit with these.

350
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,570
I think this is fine.

351
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,710
How should I get some more levels, guys?

352
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,870
How do you get more levels really fast?

353
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,370
Do I have more on my feet?

354
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,050
I'm breaking 3, fire protection.

355
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,530
I'm breaking 3.

356
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,230
We gotta sleep.

357
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,790
Okay, I'm just checking my chestplate real fast.

358
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,510
Mining quartz in the nether.

359
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,530
You guys are funny.

360
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,850
You guys are so funny.

361
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,230
You guys are so funny.

362
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,610
We're not going back.

363
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,110
You guys are so funny.

364
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,630
You guys are so funny.

365
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,650
You guys are so funny.

366
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,670
I'll kill fish.

367
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,750
I'll kill fish.

368
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,550
Don't make us go back there.

369
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,210
I'll kill fish, it's fine.

370
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,350
Don't make us go back there.

371
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,350
We're gonna fucking go crazy.

372
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,070
Don't make us go back into the nether.

373
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,330
Mining coal.

374
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,030
Where can I find some coal?

375
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,630
Don't do that.

376
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,450
Where can I find some coal?

377
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,630
Min and I are two different types of sleeping.

378
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,590
You're just... you're fatigued.

379
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,790
I'm just delusional.

380
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,090
I'm just delusional.

381
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,510
Oh my god, there's dogs!

382
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,610
I can't get to the...

383
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,190
Oh my gosh, but the dogs went to home.

384
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,550
I can kill a bunch of animals.

385
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,470
Kill.

386
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,250
Kill.

387
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,490
I'm in my kill era.

388
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,970
I also, we have the leather books.

389
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,110
Leather and paper for books too.

390
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:18,610
Oh yeah.

391
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,030
But we have like 30.

392
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,450
We already have a lot of books now.

393
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,670
But just in case we're like trying really to get like feather falling or something.

394
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,410
Well that's true.

395
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,250
To like refresh the enchantments, right?

396
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,410
Yeah, or something.

397
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,750
What do I want to get?

398
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,530
My bones.

399
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,610
Okay.

400
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,430
It's 4.30 and you're dying?

401
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,110
Insane.

402
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,190
I'm already dead.

403
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,570
I'm already dead.

404
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,470
I can't die anymore.

405
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,670
That's why it's just an actual hell for me.

406
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,270
You're just in hell.

407
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,670
I'm just in hell.

408
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,570
Because I'm done.

409
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,690
I want to die, but I can't die.

410
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,350
What are you doing?

411
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,790
You can't die again.

412
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,370
Oh, there's a dog.

413
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,070
We didn't die those three times.

414
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,490
Wait, there's two dogs here.

415
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,450
Yeah, I'm trying to get them right now.

416
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,130
I'm trying to get those two dogs.

417
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,230
I'm trying to get them in my fucking army.

418
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,770
They will be the clutch.

419
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,110
This dog took four of my...

420
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,650
Oh my god.

421
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,730
Okay, this one's not picky.

422
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,750
Oh, there's coal here, but there's a zombie too.

423
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,790
You're not picky.

424
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,750
Wait, you're gonna die here.

425
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,250
You're not picky.

426
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,190
That's so happy.

427
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,890
You know what?

428
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:36,330
I'm ready.

429
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,670
I'm ready to go.

430
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,710
I'm ready.

431
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,030
I'm ready.

432
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,930
Ready to go where?

433
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,590
I'm ready to find the stronghold.

434
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,890
I'm so ready, man.

435
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,910
I'm ready to go in.

436
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,670
We're not gonna win.

437
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,950
We won't live.

438
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,530
Yes, we will.

439
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,630
Yes, we will.

440
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,190
If we don't, we won't live.

441
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,950
We won't live.

442
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,930
You don't know that.

443
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,830
You said that we're going another two or three hours.

444
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,290
What happened?

445
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,830
I feel so strong.

446
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,470
I feel so strong now.

447
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,150
How?

448
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,010
What did you do?

449
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,090
I don't know.

450
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,390
I just feel something in me.

451
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,090
I'm locked in.

452
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,910
We're gonna kill those...

453
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,310
I'm gonna kill those fucking...

454
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,350
I'm locking in.

455
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,250
I'm locking in with my aimbot.

456
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,810
I'm gonna lock in.

457
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,110
I'm gonna hit those towers.

458
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,990
And then it's gonna be so easy.

459
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:33,850
I've done it before.

460
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,950
I can do it again.

461
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,290
I can...

462
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,350
I'm not delusional.

463
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,850
I swear to God.

464
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:42,910
I'm not...

465
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,050
I'm not delusional.

466
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,250
I can hit those...

467
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,010
I can hit those blocks.

468
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,690
It's gonna be so easy to hit them.

469
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,710
I'm not delusional.

470
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,070
I swear it's gonna be so easy.

471
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,030
Delulu is the solulu.

472
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,010
I'm not the Lulu.

473
00:16:59,210 --> 00:16:59,610
I'm not the Lulu.

474
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,390
I know I'm not.

475
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,210
I'm not the Lulu.

476
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,190
I'm not the Lulu.

477
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,190
I am.

478
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,070
I'm a Lulu.

479
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,470
I am blue Lulu.

480
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:14,090
Oh my gosh, I mined so much and I didn't even get anything.

481
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,310
Wait, what dogs are you trying to get?

482
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,830
I already got them.

483
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,870
I got the two dogs.

484
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,690
There's two more dogs over here.

485
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,390
How many fucking dogs are there?

486
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,930
I don't have another bone though.

487
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,010
I already got my bone.

488
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,010
Are we mining the quartz?

489
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,150
Are we?

490
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,510
No, we're not.

491
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,150
I'm going in.

492
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,710
Oh yeah, we have to get a lot of levels, don't we?

493
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,250
Wait, I'm going in.

494
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,630
Don't go in, Mint.

495
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,470
Don't go in.

496
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,130
This is the one.

497
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,250
I'm going in.

498
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,830
How did you get...

499
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,950
How did you get the obsidian?

500
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,330
We have one more.

501
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,750
Don't come with me, dogs.

502
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,430
Where I'm going, I don't know if I'm coming back.

503
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,930
Where I'm going...

504
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:56,930
I'll take care of you if she dies.

505
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,970
Where I'm going, I don't know.

506
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,750
I need to go back.

507
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,670
I forgot to bring my gold armor.

508
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,010
Oh, the gold armor.

509
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,830
Get me back in.

510
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,950
Get me back in.

511
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,110
Why isn't it getting me back in?

512
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,110
I almost didn't make it back.

513
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,350
Wait, there's gold nuggets here.

514
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:25,910
Where's my gold chest?

515
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,910
No, that's the gold armor I threw away.

516
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,590
Okay, it's fine.

517
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,510
I can make a helmet.

518
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,810
I can make a helmet real quick.

519
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,890
There we go.

520
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,590
Give me all your phantom membranes.

521
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,030
I got my one phantom membrane.

522
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,590
It's in here.

523
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,410
Where I'm going, I don't know if I'm coming back.

524
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,750
If you don't come back, then we're dead.

525
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,290
Wait, what do you mean you're one phantom membrane?

526
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,470
There's nothing in here.

527
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,970
It's in your other chest.

528
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,590
No, it's not.

529
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,210
There's only two chests here.

530
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,610
I took it back.

531
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,210
I accidentally took it back.

532
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,710
It's back in my inventory.

533
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,130
Why did you do that?

534
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,390
I'm coming back.

535
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,850
I'm here.

536
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,770
I'm here.

537
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,550
Put it back.

538
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,510
I put it back.

539
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,250
Thanks, I got it.

540
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,990
I put it back.

541
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,610
I'm going back again.

542
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,490
Where's the redstone?

543
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,550
It's in your other chest.

544
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,410
I got it.

545
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,370
To make this...

546
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,530
Where's the glass?

547
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,490
We got the glass.

548
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,330
We can make a bottle.

549
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,470
I'm at level 26.

550
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,050
They do stack.

551
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,470
Oops.

552
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,390
They don't stack when there's stuff in it.

553
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,110
That's basically it.

554
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,570
You just gotta...

555
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,390
I put the powder in here.

556
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,870
How much levels should I get?

557
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,690
Where is it in here?

558
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,090
The exciting stuff in here.

559
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,110
We need the water.

560
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,210
We need the water.

561
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,190
How many what?

562
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,350
How many levels?

563
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,470
I'm at level 26 now.

564
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,570
Get as many as you can.

565
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,530
I'll get as many.

566
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,050
Just let me know when to come back.

567
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,050
When you're done with everything else...

568
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,610
Then I'll come back.

569
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,070
I'm just gonna keep farming until you're done with everything else.

570
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,310
Okay.

571
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,470
And then every other prep stuff.

572
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,390
And then we just go.

573
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,690
But I also need to get levels.

574
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,330
Okay.

575
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,630
When you're done...

576
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,950
When I get to 30, we swap.

577
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,010
Swap.

578
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,830
I'm gonna leave some quartz for you.

579
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,430
I'm leaving some easy quartz.

580
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,990
I'm gonna go for the harder ones.

581
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,970
How do I make the eye of the ender?

582
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,950
Oh, do I make it...

583
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,730
The blaze rods thing first?

584
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:05,950
Or...

585
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,190
We have the blaze rods.

586
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,250
Oh my god, I have blaze rods.

587
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,590
I'm coming back down.

588
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,490
Oh my god, you just took everything.

589
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:14,790
I did!

590
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,670
I did take everything!

591
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,630
I just never had it in my inventory.

592
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:19,930
I...

593
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,830
Oh, cook the quartz for XP?

594
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,070
That's what they're for?

595
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,030
Yeah, the quartz are for XP.

596
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,070
That's all we...

597
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,350
Oh, I thought they meant farming them.

598
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,190
I thought they just meant farming them.

599
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,370
I didn't realize cooking them.

600
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,550
What is this BGM?

601
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,090
This is my mental state right now.

602
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,210
My BGM.

603
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,230
That's how I feel right now.

604
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,350
I don't know how the others...

605
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,150
Are you listening to the...

606
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:46,730
Fart...

607
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,410
Competition too?

608
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:50,550
What?

609
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,490
What?

610
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,830
What are you talking about?

611
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,890
What are you...

612
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,310
What are you talking about?

613
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,750
The song!

614
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,710
It says your BGM!

615
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,850
I could put it on if you guys would listen to it.

616
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,710
That's the...

617
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,350
Wait, you can cook the quartz?

618
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,990
Oh my god, I got one guy.

619
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,170
They were like...

620
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,070
Okay, I gave you my blaze rods.

621
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,090
The blaze rods are in.

622
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,850
And I put emerald.

623
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,990
I think that's... And I put all the lapis stuff.

624
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,530
I'm going back in.

625
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,990
Oh, we have to pick it up with silk touch.

626
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,110
We don't have that!

627
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,050
We don't have that!

628
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,550
Oh wait, it's here.

629
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,010
I have the song, you guys.

630
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,550
Here you go.

631
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,710
This is the fart competition.

632
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,430
Alright.

633
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,710
When I hit 30, I'll let you farm the other quartz.

634
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,710
I think we need...

635
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,910
We need a minimum so we can have one more...

636
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,890
30 would be like one more enchantment that we get to have on level 30.

637
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,230
There's so many quartz.

638
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,850
Thank god there's so many quartz.

639
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,700
Up we go.

640
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,440
Up we go.

641
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh my god, it's over here.

642
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,880
It's over here.

643
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,440
You're alive, okay?

644
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,880
You're alive.

645
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,480
Sorry, I was jamming to the music.

646
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:09,620
Okay.

647
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,580
Oh shit, we gotta sleep.

648
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,060
Oh shit.

649
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,480
Oh, I'm coming back.

650
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,020
Wait, can you sleep if I'm in the nether?

651
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,660
No, you have to be sleeping too.

652
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,640
Okay, I'm coming back.

653
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,340
I'm coming back.

654
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,360
I'm heading back right now.

655
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,740
I'm running, I'm fucking running over.

656
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,920
I think their dogs won't protect me either.

657
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,080
They hate me.

658
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,520
I'm running back, I'm fucking running.

659
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,780
You wanna swap over so you can farm the quartz?

660
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,860
I left a lot of quartz to the right.

661
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,160
Uh, I need the gold stuff.

662
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,340
Okay, I got it.

663
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,040
I'm sleeping.

664
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,120
I'm here.

665
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,860
I'm sleeping.

666
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,840
I just don't wanna kill the pigs.

667
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,060
I feel like I'm gonna fucking die if I do.

668
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,120
I need it here, I dropped some gold for you.

669
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,660
Oh, you can sleep while the other person is in the nether?

670
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,540
Oh, okay.

671
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,520
You dropped some wood for me?

672
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,140
Oh, thank you.

673
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,140
Guys, I feel like if I try to kill the pigmen, I will die.

674
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,460
Guys, I will 100% die if I try to kill them.

675
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,200
Guys, I will 100% die if I try to kill them.

676
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,580
There's no way, there's no way I will live.

677
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,160
There's no way.

678
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:28,600
Okay.

679
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,380
What happened?

680
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,780
Wait, I'm coming back, I'm coming back!

681
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,940
You let the pigmen come into my house!

682
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,440
She's not gonna hurt you!

683
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,900
She literally came out swinging a sword!

684
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,520
Wait, why?

685
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,200
And now he's a zombie.

686
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,220
I don't know why.

687
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,500
How did he...

688
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,220
How did we have an invader?

689
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,740
Okay.

690
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,580
Alright, I'm gonna do something really crazy.

691
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,360
He's a zombie now, it's okay.

692
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,060
I'm gonna do something...

693
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,240
I'm gonna do something very crazy.

694
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,380
Okay guys, we're gonna make potions.

695
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:08,800
I'm gonna...

696
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,240
I'm gonna try and kill these pigs.

697
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,060
For XP.

698
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,080
What pigs?

699
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,360
Oh, the regular pigmen?

700
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,400
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

701
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,680
Oh, I mean I can kill this guy.

702
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,420
Yeah, kill him.

703
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,320
Take his stuff, take his stuff.

704
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,660
Oh my god, here's some gold stuff too.

705
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,620
Yeah, thanks.

706
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,200
Perfect.

707
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,220
Okay, I'm gonna do something very crazy.

708
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,960
I'm gonna put a spectral arrow.

709
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,540
And then...

710
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,780
Okay, so I first do the nether wart, right?

711
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,880
I do the wart...

712
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,620
And then I do...

713
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,680
Okay, I'm...

714
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,560
Yes.

715
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,100
This might be how I die.

716
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,820
Do I put it in here or in here?

717
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,620
Then the membrane.

718
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:54,780
Okay.

719
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,720
This could be how I die.

720
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,620
Wait, there's a lot of pigmen.

721
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,940
Maybe I'm not gonna do this.

722
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,540
Actually, let me see if I can find quartz.

723
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,460
Or membrane redstone.

724
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,160
I'll put it...

725
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,840
Where's the quartz I saw here?

726
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,220
Oh, I have to fuel it with the blaze powder.

727
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:13,820
Oh, okay.

728
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,260
Thanks, guys.

729
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,400
Alright.

730
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,980
Yeah, you guys, I realized how bad of an idea that was.

731
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,340
I'm already in too deep.

732
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,660
I'm already...

733
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,280
I'm already in too deep.

734
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,340
Alright.

735
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,680
You're doing it.

736
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,520
You're doing it.

737
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,080
I have levels.

738
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,740
I'm level 30.

739
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,740
You can go and farm some quartz if you need to.

740
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,140
I'm gonna make a trail for you to follow.

741
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,280
Follow this trail.

742
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,060
To farm quartz for levels.

743
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,600
Goop, goop, goop.

744
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,340
I made a torch trail.

745
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,080
Follow it.

746
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,420
And then you'll find lots of quartz around you.

747
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,500
Now the membrane.

748
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,660
I got it.

749
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,780
I made a torch trail for you.

750
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,220
Is it working?

751
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,560
Is it working?

752
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,340
Or do I need the blaze powder too?

753
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,540
I need the blaze powder.

754
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,100
Okay.

755
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,700
Where is it cooking?

756
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,540
I'm here.

757
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,740
Oh, next to the redstone.

758
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,560
I'm gonna check for...

759
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,480
Did it work?

760
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,440
Don't mine the gold.

761
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,240
Just remember not to mine the gold.

762
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,220
But it's not long.

763
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,400
It's not long.

764
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,940
Wait, but it's only a minute and 30.

765
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,700
Oh, redstone now.

766
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,500
Okay, okay.

767
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,960
Okay, now redstone.

768
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,900
Okay, thank you guys.

769
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,540
There we go.

770
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:36,860
Okay.

771
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,200
Okay.

772
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,440
We're doing it.

773
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:43,760
Okay.

774
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,800
I need to reset.

775
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,780
How do I reset again?

776
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,020
Do I just put a book in here?

777
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,540
Is that it?

778
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,900
Yeah, you have to reset your gacha with something else.

779
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,520
Like with my book, right?

780
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,860
Yeah, I think so.

781
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,340
And it resets all three?

782
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:05,900
Yeah.

783
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,560
You have all the other books.

784
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,360
Oh, I have books.

785
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:10,960
Yeah, here you go.

786
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,020
Can you pass me?

787
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,460
And the lapis.

788
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:13,940
Here you go.

789
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,740
Lapis.

790
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,920
Awkward potions.

791
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,720
Wait, I need the blaze powder here.

792
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,460
Oh wait, wait, wait.

793
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:33,980
I'm scared.

794
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,240
I'll do this then.

795
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,720
Reset level one.

796
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,900
It's still power.

797
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,600
Oh, okay.

798
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,540
Now I go back to...

799
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,800
Wait, what do I get then?

800
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,360
Not until the fuel runs out.

801
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,300
Oh, I see.

802
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,680
Fire protection, blast protection 2.

803
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,180
Oh, blast protection 2.

804
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,420
We're doing it.

805
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,320
The blaze rod should last us a while then.

806
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,300
Blast protection.

807
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,780
Oh, blast protection 4.

808
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,680
Oh, nice.

809
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,880
There's a blast protection 4 here.

810
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,260
Okay.

811
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:06,800
Alright.

812
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,000
Ouchie, ouchie.

813
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:12,460
Okay.

814
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,840
Back in there we go.

815
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,860
I almost forgot.

816
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,040
I almost forgot.

817
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,000
No, you don't want the blast protection.

818
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,300
You want regular protection.

819
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:27,700
Oh.

820
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,720
I keep forgetting.

821
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,800
Okay, so I have to reset again.

822
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,340
Oh.

823
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,600
And then we do a redstone.

824
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,640
I don't want to just hold on to it.

825
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:45,920
Okay.

826
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,980
How many levels do you need for...

827
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,500
What level are you now?

828
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:52,980
29.

829
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,120
But I'm about to be at 0.

830
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,240
How are you about to be 0?

831
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,220
Because I want to put the protection on my chest.

832
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,220
No, it just takes a couple of levels.

833
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,320
It doesn't take the whole thing.

834
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,580
Oh.

835
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,720
Yeah.

836
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,020
Nevermind.

837
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,380
It just takes a couple.

838
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,000
Okay, where are the other quartz?

839
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,120
Oh my god.

840
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,400
At the membrane.

841
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,320
Where are the other quartz?

842
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,740
Oh, not the soul sand.

843
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,060
Why is the soul sand right next to us?

844
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,980
I need like one more.

845
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,340
Okay.

846
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,200
Two more.

847
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,560
I'll leave this for you.

848
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,480
I'll leave this for you.

849
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,900
What do you leave it for me?

850
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,040
Don't you need them for farm?

851
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,220
What is it?

852
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,040
What do you leave it?

853
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,540
What do I need the farm for?

854
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:52,840
Levels.

855
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:53,500
Oh.

856
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,520
Don't you need the levels?

857
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,580
Yeah.

858
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,060
Yeah.

859
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,180
Yeah.

860
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,540
One life.

861
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,780
One life, guys.

862
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,780
If we don't make it here, it's over.

863
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,260
We'll do this next time.

864
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,640
When we're not...

865
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,040
When we're more prepared.

866
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,400
I watched the video.

867
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,920
But it was...

868
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,380
It's not...

869
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,420
We would take us...

870
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,760
Tokyo, it wasn't us!

871
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,760
It wasn't us!

872
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,380
It was the...

873
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,820
It was the fortress!

874
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,860
It was the fortress!

875
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,860
It wasn't even our fault.

876
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,860
It's the fortress.

877
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,080
It's the fortress.

878
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,640
It was the force...

879
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,740
It was the fucking fortress.

880
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,240
We could have fucking finished this so long ago.

881
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,700
With the fucking fortress.

882
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,600
Okay, protection tube, blast protection, I could get...

883
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,520
Where am I at?

884
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,080
Wait, the membrane.

885
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,800
Do I just put protection on it?

886
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,400
Do I might as well just put protection?

887
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,120
Or do I... I don't want to reset again.

888
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,680
I feel like...

889
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,200
Just protection.

890
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,720
I feel like if I reset, it's just going to be a waste.

891
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,640
Chat, do I reset?

892
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,230
I'll just get this.

893
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,710
I'll just get the radio protection.

894
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:29,810
Okay.

895
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:31,910
Restore.

896
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:32,630
Restore.

897
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,050
Oh shit, okay.

898
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:39,930
I feel like if I just... Yeah, I don't want to... I'm not going to... Okay, and then...

899
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,230
Okay, and then that should reset the others too, right?

900
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,550
Protection 4!

901
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,710
Let's go!

902
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,310
Okay, helmet protection 4.

903
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,850
And then B is also protection 4.

904
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,870
Okay, I'll get the helmet.

905
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:58,570
Okay, we got all the slow falling, so hopefully that's enough.

906
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,050
Nice.

907
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,870
Alright, you can go grind some quartz first because I've been hogging the quartz.

908
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,990
Hold on, I gotta make more potions.

909
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:08,770
Okay.

910
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,850
Alright, I'll go check if I can find other ways to grind.

911
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,490
Get... I'll just go for the harder quartz to find.

912
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:26,310
I can do... I'll just go for the harder places to find quartz so I don't take the easy ones.

913
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:34,850
I made torches halfway through to get the easy ones for quartz, so...

914
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:36,870
This should be fine.

915
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:37,590
Okay.

916
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:40,610
So...

917
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:46,510
We're not... We're not gonna... We're not gonna... Guys, we're not...

918
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,410
We're not... We can't, guys.

919
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,090
We can't cook quartz.

920
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,790
We got lied to before and it doesn't work.

921
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,390
Cooking quartz doesn't work.

922
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,190
It's all fake news.

923
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,130
What if I'm a cooking quartz?

924
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:03,230
It said you can cook quartz, but you have to use silk touch the quartz to cook them.

925
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:04,510
Who?

926
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,090
What?

927
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,230
I've never heard that.

928
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,910
Copper on furnace can give you good XP.

929
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,030
Oh, put copper in furnace.

930
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,790
We have a lot of copper.

931
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,810
We don't need fire resist, but it breathes fire.

932
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,990
Oh, regen potion.

933
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:20,630
Okay.

934
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,480
Oh, you had a... You had a gas tear.

935
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,560
Okay, I got it.

936
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,020
I do.

937
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,400
I do.

938
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,300
I got it.

939
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,280
I thought you had some too.

940
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,020
I do.

941
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,660
I have three.

942
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,780
I remember you had some as well.

943
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,580
Okay.

944
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,240
Okay.

945
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,220
Wait.

946
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:49,820
So now I do the gas tear and then I do the redstone as usual.

947
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,680
Wait, so what was the point of the magma?

948
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,960
Magma cream.

949
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,860
I think there was no point.

950
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,600
I think they were trying to tell us it was useless.

951
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,460
It breathes weird purple pain gas.

952
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,460
That's weird.

953
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,140
Oh, it's for the fortress.

954
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,390
Wait, we don't have... Wait, what?

955
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,350
The glowstone?

956
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:25,030
Wouldn't it be better if it lasted longer than the glowstone?

957
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,890
Okay, I'm mining.

958
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,970
I'm mining.

959
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,010
Alright.

960
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,550
Alright, I got... I got some.

961
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:44,490
I'll put some... If I get two more, I can get protection four on both of my fucking items.

962
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,590
Do you know... Do you see any glowstone in there?

963
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,210
Yeah, I can get some.

964
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:50,730
Okay.

965
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,910
Any glowstone for...

966
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,150
For the potions.

967
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,690
Okay, I'll grab them then.

968
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,630
I wish making potions gave you experience.

969
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,070
You can put some stuff in the furnace.

970
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,690
I have nothing though.

971
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:06,910
Don't we have like copper?

972
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,750
I thought we had copper.

973
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,450
I thought we had a lot of copper.

974
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,370
Nah, I don't see it.

975
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,170
I think you got rid of all the copper.

976
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,410
Oh, I might have.

977
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,590
I might have thrown them away.

978
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,770
Honestly, I'm not surprised.

979
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,490
Okay, I got the experience.

980
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,050
Cook meat.

981
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,590
Oh, there's a meat.

982
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,570
Thanks guys.

983
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,570
Oh, I have lots of meat.

984
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,210
Right here.

985
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:38,630
I'm gonna have to grab some more rocks here.

986
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,830
So I can make sure not to accidentally mine the gold.

987
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,330
I'll go grab the glowstone.

988
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,830
Look at how we're making meat.

989
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,810
What's happening?

990
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,170
We're doing the final preparation.

991
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:03,390
Can I cook the ancient debris in the blast furnace?

992
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,250
You can, I'm pretty sure, right?

993
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,850
It seems like you could.

994
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,150
Oh, I need four.

995
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,170
What am I cooking?

996
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:18,930
I'm scared.

997
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:19,070
I'm scared.

998
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,330
Will it still work?

999
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,530
Oh wait, it turned into scrap.

1000
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,630
I remember it turned into scrap.

1001
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,670
Little scrap.

1002
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,730
It'll go away.

1003
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,090
It'll go away.

1004
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,590
It's gonna go away.

1005
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,410
It's gonna go away, guys.

1006
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,470
The gas is gonna go away.

1007
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,930
The gas will go away.

1008
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,010
The gas will go away.

1009
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,810
The gas is gonna go away, I believe.

1010
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,250
I believe.

1011
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,810
The blast furnace gives you half XP?

1012
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,170
No way.

1013
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,270
That's a scam.

1014
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,010
That's a scam.

1015
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,930
I can't believe it.

1016
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,450
Oh god.

1017
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,990
How did they do 20 days of this?

1018
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,810
They were barely alive.

1019
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,590
Did you watch all of it?

1020
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:28,250
No, I watched some of it, but they were not alive.

1021
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:34,710
I think by day 7, they weren't even alive anymore.

1022
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,370
They weren't even there anymore.

1023
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,970
I'm so sad.

1024
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:41,410
I'm so sad.

1025
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:47,210
I remember at the Kaisen Island speed.

1026
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:54,110
When they did their infamous Minecraft challenge, they were not alive.

1027
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,690
They like, okay, you know what's really...

1028
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,510
They like streamed their showers and everything too.

1029
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,090
Yes!

1030
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:06,490
Yes!

1031
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,950
They like...

1032
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,690
They were in their swimming trunks, but they were like...

1033
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:18,030
They basically showered on stream and everything.

1034
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,930
Oh my god.

1035
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:20,550
Yeah.

1036
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,170
That's horrifying.

1037
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,770
I put it in your potion box.

1038
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,190
Chest?

1039
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:27,950
Okay, cool.

1040
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,690
Trying to find more animals to kill.

1041
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,110
I'm hungry for blood.

1042
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,610
Alright, I'm going to enchant my boots.

1043
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,950
Armadillo, I could never hurt you.

1044
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,150
What the hell is this?

1045
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,450
What the fuck is this?

1046
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:50,870
I don't have feather falling on it though, so that's unfortunate.

1047
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,950
But that's the best I can do.

1048
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,430
What is this thing?

1049
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,450
I got an armadillo scoot.

1050
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,050
Oh, that's to make the armor.

1051
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,550
That's to make the armor.

1052
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,230
You can make armor for your dog.

1053
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,270
Yeah, you were the one that told me that.

1054
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,190
I know, but I didn't know what it was when I grabbed it.

1055
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,870
I put glow dust in the area.

1056
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,630
Also, we're going to have to really stock up on food, so we'll have to...

1057
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,810
I have a lot of bread, so...

1058
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:27,150
But meat gives more...

1059
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,230
Okay, I have cows or... which one?

1060
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,990
Cows, pigs, or lambs?

1061
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:32,990
Any of them.

1062
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,070
I'm grabbing some of them.

1063
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,150
I can kill some of them right now.

1064
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:37,890
I'm heading over.

1065
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,710
I'm heading over.

1066
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:44,010
Oh yeah, I can go to the quartz mine.

1067
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,690
Yeah, you go farm quartz, I'll go get some meat for us.

1068
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,530
Okay, I was just trying to make these...

1069
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,730
I put glow dust too.

1070
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,590
You want to put stuff in the glow dust?

1071
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,130
And...

1072
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:58,930
Wait, does water work in the ender?

1073
00:41:59,570 --> 00:41:59,950
Yeah.

1074
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,810
Oh, okay.

1075
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,250
You can have a scoot.

1076
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,250
You can see how ugly it looks.

1077
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,490
Oh no, I'm pretty sure it sounds ugly.

1078
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:10,890
It's really ugly.

1079
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,750
It sounds very ugly.

1080
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,510
Okay, so now we glowstone it.

1081
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,750
Now we glowstone it.

1082
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:22,870
Alright.

1083
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,750
Okay, I got us...

1084
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,850
eight lamb chops.

1085
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,610
I'm going to throw away this meat too.

1086
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,930
And then...

1087
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,750
Oh yeah, didn't we want to bring snowmen?

1088
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:36,970
No, we don't.

1089
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:37,230
No.

1090
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,150
There's no point.

1091
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,870
There was a snow point.

1092
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,050
Oh my gosh, the regeneration...

1093
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:47,430
So the endermen don't come near us because the endermen don't like the snow.

1094
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,490
Yeah, but that's important, right?

1095
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,650
I don't think we have snow though.

1096
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:53,810
We need silk touch.

1097
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,350
We don't have that.

1098
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,750
So this is our one life.

1099
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,190
Water works better than snow.

1100
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,370
Oh, oh, no.

1101
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,330
I have a bucket anyway.

1102
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,930
I almost messed it up.

1103
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,210
I almost messed it up.

1104
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,810
We can just make a water pool in the center.

1105
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:12,910
Should we just bring two buckets?

1106
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,670
One would be used as a water pool.

1107
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,370
So we bait the endermen, we can just put a pool.

1108
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,790
Oh yeah, there is a way to shovel...

1109
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,130
Use a shovel to pick up snow, but...

1110
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,230
And then we can turn the snowballs into cubes.

1111
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:28,870
But...

1112
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:31,910
If water's fine, we should be fine.

1113
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,730
Yeah, let's just use water.

1114
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:34,510
It's just easier.

1115
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:35,730
That should be fine.

1116
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,170
Yeah, water bucket is just easier.

1117
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,830
Make sure I have... Oh my god, there's so much sheep here.

1118
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,370
I'm getting the sheep.

1119
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:47,610
Okay.

1120
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:49,890
Goodbye sheep.

1121
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:53,350
We need you to die so we can live.

1122
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:00,190
This is what my power is worth.

1123
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:00,990
Oh, I forgot the glowstone.

1124
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,270
Glow dust.

1125
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,630
Let's see.

1126
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,870
Oh my gosh, this blaze rod lasted forever.

1127
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:09,650
That's awesome.

1128
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,290
Yeah, you can make three potions, I think.

1129
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,370
That's what they said.

1130
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,510
Yeah, but...

1131
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:20,630
Okay, so one blaze rod turns into two powders...

1132
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,830
And I've only used one powder this entire time.

1133
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,610
Oh, wait, that's...

1134
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:25,910
That's a lot.

1135
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,830
Wowee, we're learning so much about Minecraft from this challenge.

1136
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:33,350
We're learning so much.

1137
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:38,090
Oh my god, didn't you like participate in a competition and win?

1138
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,570
How do you not know anything?

1139
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,530
The competition has nothing to do with Minecraft.

1140
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,230
It's just parkour and minigames.

1141
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:49,130
And I played Valorant...

1142
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,030
I somehow was able to play Valorant in Minecraft.

1143
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,130
I don't know how, but I played Valorant in Minecraft.

1144
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:58,070
Okay.

1145
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:01,090
Anyway, I have to do that competition again on Monday.

1146
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,130
Not Monday, on Saturday.

1147
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:04,490
Oh my god.

1148
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,390
Where am I?

1149
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:08,910
She got so offended, you guys.

1150
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,670
Where am I?

1151
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:12,270
Oh my god.

1152
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,570
How did I get lost?

1153
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:16,850
What?

1154
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:17,270
Tell me.

1155
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,290
Give us the coordinates.

1156
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:19,010
Okay, okay.

1157
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,830
Yeah, yeah, I'm looking at the coordinates right now.

1158
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:22,130
I'm, like, wondering where I went.

1159
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,410
I traveled so far.

1160
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:26,550
The sun is setting.

1161
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,530
Oh, we put pumpkin heads!

1162
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:30,330
Pumpkin heads!

1163
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,710
Pumpkin heads makes Enderman neutral.

1164
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,250
So we wear pumpkin heads.

1165
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,610
Oh yeah, but we can't see.

1166
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,190
Oh, that's true.

1167
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,210
That's true, nevermind.

1168
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,310
Oh wait, does this count?

1169
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,150
You guys, I have nothing left.

1170
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,910
I have no dust powder.

1171
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:49,950
No blaze powder left.

1172
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,720
But did it work?

1173
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,400
Heading back.

1174
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,160
I think I'm heading back.

1175
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,720
Guys, I'm lost.

1176
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,120
Where did I go?

1177
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,880
I don't know where I went.

1178
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,080
I don't want to use all blaze powder.

1179
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,860
You think it's fine just for three potions, guys?

1180
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,520
Is this where I went?

1181
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,520
Is this where I went?

1182
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,320
How did I go so far?

1183
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,280
Are you not able to sleep?

1184
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,560
Um...

1185
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,440
I'm trying.

1186
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,620
Oh my god, am I heading the right way?

1187
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,520
Yes, I am.

1188
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,160
Yes, I am.

1189
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:40,880
I'm coming back.

1190
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,600
I don't know how I got here.

1191
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,180
I'm heading back now.

1192
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,180
I'm heading back.

1193
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,780
I see the tower.

1194
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,020
I know where you are.

1195
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,480
Oh, I see you.

1196
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,000
I see you.

1197
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,420
I'm here.

1198
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,440
I'm here.

1199
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,160
Alright, let's sleep.

1200
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,600
I got lots of meat for us.

1201
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:01,840
Hello, boy.

1202
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,080
There's a creeper right over the way.

1203
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,820
Oh, it's okay.

1204
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,080
It's not like he's going to come over here and kill us.

1205
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,120
Yeah, I wouldn't do that, coward.

1206
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,960
You wouldn't do it.

1207
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,780
That's such a lame-ass thing to do.

1208
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,400
Oh my god, I have so much lamb.

1209
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,400
I'm going to put the meat here and then...

1210
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:26,820
Uh...

1211
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,040
I'll put the raw meat here and try to find more meat for us.

1212
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,080
Wait, where did my...

1213
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,780
Guys, where did my...

1214
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,160
Where did my...

1215
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,340
Where did the thing underneath go?

1216
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,480
What did I press?

1217
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,400
What did I...

1218
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,520
Oh, F1.

1219
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,580
How did I...

1220
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,720
Wait, that's not F1.

1221
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,660
It's not F1.

1222
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,400
What did I...

1223
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:52,260
What?

1224
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,440
That's...Why is F1...

1225
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,280
Why is F1 that?

1226
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,240
I pressed F1.

1227
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,360
What are you talking about?

1228
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,420
How do I...Oh.

1229
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,020
Oh, that's what I did.

1230
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,080
No, I couldn't see my thing for a while.

1231
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,920
It's going crazy.

1232
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,660
I couldn't see my HUD.

1233
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,620
I was trying to figure out how to un-HUD it.

1234
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:24,780
Or HUD it back.

1235
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,100
HUD it back.

1236
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,900
Okay, I got it.

1237
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,100
What else do we need, chat?

1238
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,200
What else do we need, chat?

1239
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,760
I'm going into the nether.

1240
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,300
Get your quartz.

1241
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,440
I'm farming more meat.

1242
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,080
Okay.

1243
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:44,790
What else do we need?

1244
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:45,730
Follow my torches.

1245
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:46,970
You'll find lots of quartz there.

1246
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:47,510
Okay.

1247
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,870
You got this, man.

1248
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:54,250
That's me.

1249
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:59,330
I'm back here once again.

1250
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,030
I'm fucking back here.

1251
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:05,610
We never thought we'd be back, but here we are.

1252
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:06,710
Back in hell.

1253
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,550
Back in hell.

1254
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,010
Alja.

1255
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:12,810
I hate you.

1256
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,130
We never thought we'd be back, but here we are.

1257
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,010
Okay, I'm following your torches.

1258
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,490
Oh, here's some.

1259
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,690
Oh, here's some.

1260
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:25,570
Okay.

1261
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,130
I'm mining.

1262
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,130
I got to level 30.

1263
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,150
Nice.

1264
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:32,670
That's all you need.

1265
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,510
Wait, when you reset, does mine also reset?

1266
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,970
I don't think so, right?

1267
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,890
That shouldn't be the case, right, everybody?

1268
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:43,490
Okay.

1269
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,410
Like, you're...

1270
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:47,810
Oh, okay, so now I have to...

1271
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,070
Alright, we can get...

1272
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,230
Reset it here.

1273
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:51,910
No?

1274
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,770
Okay, so...

1275
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:54,750
Okay, that's good to know.

1276
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:58,270
Alright, I have a lot of different types of meat for us, too.

1277
00:49:58,550 --> 00:49:59,890
A lot of variety.

1278
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,590
So I think we should have enough.

1279
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,330
We should have enough for the dragon.

1280
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,670
It's like KBBQ up in here.

1281
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:10,390
Yeah, we have all different flavors.

1282
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:15,810
All different flavors and tastes and variety.

1283
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:19,290
Exciting!

1284
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:20,770
Exciting.

1285
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,170
Alright, here we go.

1286
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:24,230
I'm coming back.

1287
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:25,450
Okay.

1288
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,970
I'm coming back with all the meat.

1289
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,630
And I'm just gonna start burning them.

1290
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,510
I'm gonna start burning them and then...

1291
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,670
Oh my god, that's a skelly.

1292
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:35,290
Oh my god, what are you doing here?

1293
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:37,150
Did you get the salt?

1294
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,210
Oh god, I'm gonna die.

1295
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:39,750
I'm gonna die.

1296
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,170
I'm fine.

1297
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:48,230
I got him.

1298
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,210
I killed him.

1299
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:49,690
I killed him.

1300
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:53,070
I killed the ghast.

1301
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,070
He was low enough for me to kill him.

1302
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,030
Okay, okay, that's good.

1303
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,010
I'm still running over.

1304
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:01,250
I'm still running over.

1305
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:03,210
I'm not gonna die.

1306
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:06,150
Maybe I will die.

1307
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,530
Don't say that.

1308
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:10,210
Don't ruin my portal, please.

1309
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:11,930
Don't say that.

1310
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:13,550
I want us to die at the end.

1311
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:15,690
If we're gonna die, we have to die...

1312
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:18,270
at least make it to the end of Dragon where we're gonna die.

1313
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:20,850
That's where we're gonna die.

1314
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,890
I can't leave.

1315
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,170
I can't leave.

1316
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,590
I can't leave.

1317
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,030
I'm stuck in here and I have no food.

1318
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,530
Yeah, because I can't get through the portal.

1319
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,270
Or else he's gonna destroy it.

1320
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,610
Don't destroy the portal, please.

1321
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,410
I can't run.

1322
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:39,150
I can't run.

1323
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:39,990
I'm heading over.

1324
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:41,110
I'm heading over.

1325
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:44,270
I don't think you can do anything unless you have...

1326
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:47,490
Okay, I think he...

1327
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,050
He's fine now.

1328
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,050
Go through it.

1329
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,130
Go through it.

1330
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:52,610
I'm here.

1331
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,090
Go through the portal.

1332
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:57,270
You're fine.

1333
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:57,910
You're fine.

1334
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:58,290
I'm here.

1335
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:58,670
I'm here.

1336
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:00,310
Did you get through?

1337
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:01,770
No, no, no.

1338
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:02,250
I'm farming.

1339
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,250
I'm gonna farm some quartz.

1340
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:03,790
It's okay.

1341
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:05,530
I'm here.

1342
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:06,030
I'm here.

1343
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:07,610
I'm here.

1344
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,270
I'll protect.

1345
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:09,790
I'll protect the portal.

1346
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:11,870
I got another gas tier.

1347
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:12,650
Lucky.

1348
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:14,850
That's not a regen.

1349
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:19,150
I can make six more regens.

1350
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:20,730
That's good.

1351
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:21,790
What should we do?

1352
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:26,130
What should we do?

1353
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:29,990
No, I didn't have any bows and arrows.

1354
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,690
I just went in.

1355
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,810
Raw doggin' it, baby.

1356
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,370
Go in.

1357
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:39,910
Yeah.

1358
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:43,130
So many fucking...

1359
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:43,970
piglings.

1360
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:46,410
Oh, I didn't get a thing.

1361
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:49,410
Piglings.

1362
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,250
They're everywhere.

1363
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:00,590
Okay.

1364
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,090
I'm doing something very...

1365
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,410
Oh, I can't do this.

1366
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,610
I can't do this.

1367
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,030
I can't fucking...

1368
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,550
Oh my god, there he is.

1369
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,430
There's the...

1370
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:14,650
Nope.

1371
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:15,410
Nope.

1372
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:17,930
Nope.

1373
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:18,350
Nope.

1374
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,590
Don't do that.

1375
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,850
Don't do that.

1376
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:21,690
Don't do that.

1377
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:23,210
Don't do that.

1378
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:26,530
Oh, thank god.

1379
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:26,790
Okay.

1380
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:27,630
Are you okay?

1381
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:28,970
Yes, I'm alright.

1382
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:29,550
I'm alright.

1383
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,590
I was fucking bobbing and weaving.

1384
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:32,750
Bobbing and weaving.

1385
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:33,850
Did you meet a coven?

1386
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:35,170
No, I'm alright.

1387
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:35,670
I'm alright.

1388
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:36,190
I'm safe.

1389
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:37,050
I made it through.

1390
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,290
The gas doesn't know.

1391
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:39,870
The gas doesn't know.

1392
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,110
Yeah.

1393
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,010
The gas is stupid, dumbass.

1394
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:46,430
Yes, it's fucking stupid as hell.

1395
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:46,830
Stupid.

1396
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,230
Where's all the books?

1397
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:51,970
I have them here.

1398
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,190
And I'll put the lapis on the second chest.

1399
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,110
I have lapis.

1400
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:56,830
There's some more.

1401
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:59,110
Okay, um...

1402
00:53:59,110 --> 00:53:59,730
Oh god.

1403
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,730
I'm just gonna kill wildlife.

1404
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:06,830
Oh, I have infinity!

1405
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:08,610
Wait, that's good!

1406
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,710
I need level 30.

1407
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:12,750
Wait, aren't you level 30?

1408
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:13,770
I'm 28.

1409
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:16,950
I used my levels to do another thing.

1410
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:18,510
Oh, okay.

1411
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,390
That's not good.

1412
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:21,570
Let me see if you have anything you can...

1413
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:23,290
Wait, if the thing...

1414
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,770
Can you get XP from meat?

1415
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:25,890
Cooking meat?

1416
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:27,550
Yeah, you can.

1417
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:30,870
Okay, I put some stuff in there so you can grab the meat for...

1418
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,350
What the hell is a bundle?

1419
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:34,770
What do you mean?

1420
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:38,070
I just looked at my things I can create.

1421
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:39,190
And what is a bundle?

1422
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:41,130
I don't know.

1423
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:44,730
Yeah, just get the stove for XP.

1424
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:46,670
I'm gonna make...

1425
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:48,070
Can hold a mix stack?

1426
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:48,690
What?

1427
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:51,250
What is this?

1428
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:52,590
Oh, extra storage?

1429
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:53,430
Yeah!

1430
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,230
Break the furnace for XP?

1431
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:58,350
It's full.

1432
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,050
Wait, how do I make it empty?

1433
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,290
Just pick it up.

1434
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:08,130
I'm gonna see if there's any animals I can kill.

1435
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:09,930
Oh, I can kill the squids.

1436
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:10,710
Yeah, you're right.

1437
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,770
Wait, you can kill squids for XP?

1438
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,490
Squids and fish...

1439
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:17,910
You can kill anything for XP.

1440
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:19,730
I'm gonna swim out.

1441
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:21,890
I'm gonna swim out.

1442
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:24,490
I think we got all the quartz too at the...

1443
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:28,610
We got all the quartz that are close.

1444
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:29,590
In the near area, yeah.

1445
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:34,350
I think the others are just way too dangerous for us to farm at that point.

1446
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:39,190
Especially because there's like skellies and gas in that area really badly.

1447
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:40,150
Yeah.

1448
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,410
I would advise not to go any further.

1449
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:47,510
I farmed all the ones that were far, but like, not dangerous.

1450
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:49,450
Cook the fish too.

1451
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:50,450
Cook the fish.

1452
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:53,430
Cook any types of meat and stuff.

1453
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:55,310
I cook the fish.

1454
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:56,490
You cook the fish?

1455
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:58,430
You cook the fish?

1456
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01,410
I cook the fish.

1457
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,190
I wish I could kill the birds.

1458
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:05,710
I wish I could just kill the birds that are flying up here.

1459
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:06,650
I wish I could just...

1460
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,130
I don't see any birds.

1461
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:11,190
No, they exist!

1462
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:11,590
They exist!

1463
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:12,390
They're there!

1464
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:13,570
No, they're not.

1465
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:14,590
There's no birds.

1466
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,550
They're real!

1467
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:16,950
They're real to me.

1468
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:17,990
There's no birds.

1469
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:19,190
They're real.

1470
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,290
What does that mean?

1471
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,050
It's a shared hallucination.

1472
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:26,370
It's a shared hallucination.

1473
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:30,250
They're real to me.

1474
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,450
They're real to me.

1475
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:32,870
Yeah.

1476
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,090
So is Santa Claus.

1477
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,810
Santa Claus is real.

1478
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:38,510
I know.

1479
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:39,770
He's real to me.

1480
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,630
He's real to all of us.

1481
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,230
Oh, I'd be so sad if I died by drowning.

1482
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,450
If that was the way I go.

1483
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:46,990
That would just be really sad, yeah.

1484
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:51,630
I'd be so sad if that was the way I decided to go after everything I've been through.

1485
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:54,730
I decided to just drown and put myself out of my misery.

1486
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:59,110
That's a valiant way to go down, probably.

1487
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:04,250
Go, die!

1488
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:04,590
Die!

1489
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:07,070
Die, squid, die!

1490
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:09,590
I can't stop going so fast.

1491
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:11,890
We have to go back.

1492
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:12,570
We have to go back.

1493
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:13,590
It's almost night time.

1494
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:14,150
Okay.

1495
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,490
I'm killing the fish.

1496
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:18,590
And then I'm cooking the fish.

1497
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,070
I'm gonna kill the cows.

1498
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:22,650
And I'm gonna kill the chicken.

1499
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:23,570
Kill the chicken.

1500
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:26,270
Kill the cow.

1501
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:29,510
I'm gonna kill the koala.

1502
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:31,150
Oh my god.

1503
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,190
I'm gonna salad fingers these.

1504
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,090
I'm gonna salad fingers.

1505
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:39,730
Oh no.

1506
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:43,550
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

1507
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:45,150
Oh yeah, check the furnace.

1508
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,110
I will.

1509
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:49,150
I have been asleep.

1510
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:50,930
Okay.

1511
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:52,910
Did you get enough XP?

1512
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:53,970
No.

1513
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,870
I have like nothing.

1514
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,230
How much does it give you?

1515
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:00,290
I'm still...

1516
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:02,090
I'm not even halfway through 28.

1517
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:08,070
Do we need all those enchantments?

1518
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:08,610
Do we?

1519
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:14,750
Do we really need everything?

1520
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:16,750
Everybody.

1521
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:20,350
Guys, do we really need...

1522
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:22,850
If we stock up on all the potions...

1523
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:27,530
Remember how I said we gotta farm all the redstone for XP.

1524
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,210
I told you man.

1525
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:30,910
I did.

1526
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:31,450
I did.

1527
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:32,510
I told you.

1528
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:36,710
I told you as much as we could.

1529
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:39,310
I'm just saying.

1530
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,090
I was at level 35.

1531
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:43,570
I told you.

1532
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:47,630
Yeah, we have to have infinity at least on one of our bows though.

1533
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:49,010
Yeah, I have power.

1534
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:50,670
Do you have arrows?

1535
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:51,890
I can give you some of the arrows I made.

1536
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:54,550
If I have infinity, I only need one.

1537
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,730
Oh, that's true.

1538
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:57,850
Doesn't it...

1539
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:59,950
Sometimes it runs out.

1540
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,650
It's literally called infinity.

1541
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:04,470
Wouldn't it like break?

1542
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:05,310
Wait, really?

1543
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:09,490
You're thinking of like the bow will break.

1544
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:10,510
Oh!

1545
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:14,250
I can give you one of my arrows.

1546
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:16,170
Yeah, we do need anvil though.

1547
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:17,230
To make it...

1548
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:19,450
I made an anvil already.

1549
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:21,190
We have an anvil everybody.

1550
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,210
We're set.

1551
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:27,050
Where is more coal that I can mine?

1552
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:32,110
Just killing the wildlife.

1553
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:34,750
Do horses give XP?

1554
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,410
Oh, I don't think so.

1555
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:38,890
Do horses...

1556
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:39,910
There's a lot of horses.

1557
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,130
I'm thinking about it.

1558
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,870
Just kill one and test it for science.

1559
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:46,370
No, because they hit back.

1560
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:47,610
They fight back.

1561
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:47,970
They do?

1562
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:50,230
The other wildlife don't fight back.

1563
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:51,790
They do.

1564
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:53,410
They do give XP.

1565
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:57,690
Yes!

1566
00:59:59,330 --> 00:59:59,930
Yes!

1567
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:02,030
Let me sneeze.

1568
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:03,330
Yes!

1569
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:04,350
Okay, they do.

1570
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:05,450
They do.

1571
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:08,610
Oh my God.

1572
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:10,650
Do armadillos give XP?

1573
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:12,330
No, don't kill the armadillos.

1574
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:13,450
Do they give XP?

1575
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:14,550
Probably nothing.

1576
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:20,310
He's just a small little guy.

1577
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:21,750
Don't do it.

1578
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:26,690
He's too cute.

1579
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:27,770
They do?

1580
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:30,410
I'm fucking going in.

1581
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,450
I'm getting us...

1582
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,410
I'm getting us meat for food.

1583
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:38,510
I have so much meat right now.

1584
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:40,330
Oh, there's a pillager right here.

1585
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,310
Better not look at him.

1586
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:47,350
Where did I get the pill here?

1587
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:48,990
I'm not going to look at him.

1588
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:50,950
I'm fucking bloodthirsty right now.

1589
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:53,110
I'll kill anything and everything except for the pillager.

1590
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,190
Because I don't want to deal with that.

1591
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:57,670
You could kill him and then...

1592
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:58,270
Take his stuff.

1593
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:00,690
No, you get the...

1594
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,910
You get the potion now.

1595
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:04,450
Oh, okay.

1596
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:05,410
I'll just go kill him then.

1597
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:06,150
Yeah, kill him.

1598
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,710
Who cares about his measly little life?

1599
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,130
He's a pathetic man.

1600
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:12,730
Whoa.

1601
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:15,210
Pathetic little pillager guy.

1602
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:15,950
Whoa.

1603
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:18,850
Alright.

1604
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:21,210
I guess I'll go kill him now.

1605
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:23,270
He's a pathetic little guy.

1606
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:25,210
Did he disappear?

1607
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:25,990
Where did he go?

1608
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,570
He deserves death.

1609
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:30,330
Yeah, he's afraid of me.

1610
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:32,350
He actually heard you.

1611
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,130
He despawned.

1612
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,130
He actually despawned.

1613
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:41,510
He's like, He's like, I'm out.

1614
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:43,470
Oh my god.

1615
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,480
Never mess with me, little pillager man.

1616
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,610
He ran away so fast.

1617
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:52,270
Oh my god.

1618
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:53,550
There's a dripstone in here.

1619
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:55,990
He actually disappeared.

1620
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:57,550
That's my power.

1621
01:01:58,350 --> 01:01:59,270
That's my power.

1622
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:01,550
He got scared.

1623
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:03,550
Oh, baby.

1624
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:05,990
Oh, baby man.

1625
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:06,030
Oh, baby man.

1626
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,250
You donkeys give...

1627
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,790
It doesn't matter, I'm gonna still kill him.

1628
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:12,670
Kill, kill, kill, kill.

1629
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:13,430
Kill all of them.

1630
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:18,070
This was what my power was for.

1631
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:20,170
I'm coming back.

1632
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:21,530
Okay.

1633
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:24,070
I'll go back too.

1634
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:30,210
More meat.

1635
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,970
Give me all my meat, please.

1636
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:35,990
Give me all these deaths.

1637
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,530
Death to the wildlife.

1638
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:40,030
Might as well go extinct in this world.

1639
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:41,350
Yeah.

1640
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:44,050
If we're gonna go extinct, the wildlife too.

1641
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:45,030
Yeah.

1642
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:47,270
If we're gonna suffer, they all suffer.

1643
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:49,570
They all suffer.

1644
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:50,210
They all suffer.

1645
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:52,830
Do my dogs...

1646
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:55,350
Oh my god.

1647
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:56,590
Would you really?

1648
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:01,850
If you were so desperate for XP, would you kill your friend?

1649
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:04,290
Do my dogs give...

1650
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:06,570
Does Doki give XP?

1651
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,430
Does Doki give XP?

1652
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:12,370
Does he give XP?

1653
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:13,870
Does Doki give XP?

1654
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:15,630
Does he?

1655
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:26,570
Your laugh is getting more and more maniacal.

1656
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:29,670
I don't wanna waste a level.

1657
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,850
I don't wanna waste a level.

1658
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,370
I was gonna name one of them.

1659
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:36,390
I was gonna name one of them.

1660
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:40,290
Look him in the eye and ask, Do you give XP?

1661
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:42,430
Do you give XP?

1662
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:45,430
That's kinda raw, man.

1663
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:47,850
Alright, I'm gonna...

1664
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:49,490
I'm gonna check.

1665
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:52,070
The Lulu laugh.

1666
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,250
Do you give XP?

1667
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,390
Do you give XP?

1668
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:58,570
Do you?

1669
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,050
Do you?

1670
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:04,310
Okay, um...

1671
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:06,370
I need...

1672
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:08,390
I need to...

1673
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:12,110
You can take the burning and the meat and stuff for the...

1674
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:14,170
I know, I've been taking it.

1675
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:15,630
Yeah, just take it.

1676
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:16,570
You can have it.

1677
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,510
I'm still... I'm not even at level 29, though.

1678
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:21,610
Uh...

1679
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:22,770
I know it's painful.

1680
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,530
Can you pass me a book?

1681
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:28,190
Oh wait, no, never mind.

1682
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:31,070
I was gonna say, I left half of them in there.

1683
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:31,490
I'm resetting.

1684
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:32,990
I need to reset one.

1685
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:33,750
Okay.

1686
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:36,850
Oh, I forgot to bring a lapis.

1687
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:40,670
Wait, you have all the lapis?

1688
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:41,830
Oh no, the lapis is here.

1689
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:43,630
No, there's lots of lapis in there.

1690
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:44,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1691
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:47,550
Time to go to the jungle.

1692
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,370
In the jungle...

1693
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:03,150
Blast?

1694
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:04,730
Why does it keep giving me...

1695
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:05,990
I'm just gonna get protection 2.

1696
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:06,930
I'm just...

1697
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:08,630
Guys, I'm just gonna get protection 2.

1698
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:09,870
Like, I...

1699
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:12,410
There's no... There's only blast protection.

1700
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:14,410
Guys, this is it.

1701
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,210
This is the best I can do.

1702
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:18,410
I can't...

1703
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:19,730
Protection 2 is fine.

1704
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:22,210
Protection 2...

1705
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,520
Don't piss me off.

1706
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,420
You look like you...

1707
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:33,240
Are just enough EXP.

1708
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,580
Are those real t-shirts?

1709
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,720
Someone said that...

1710
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,020
This song has gotten more and more sad...

1711
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:44,060
As the time goes on.

1712
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:47,760
Hey...

1713
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,280
Hey...

1714
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:49,960
What are you playing?

1715
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,020
No, the...

1716
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,300
The Lion Sleeps Tonight.

1717
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,580
The more I sing that song...

1718
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,600
The sadder it becomes.

1719
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,740
I know, I was really excited about it at first.

1720
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:06,520
The lion sleeps tonight...

1721
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:13,420
I wish I were that lion...

1722
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,680
I wish I were that lion...

1723
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,100
Why is there no coal?

1724
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,280
No chicken?

1725
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:29,100
There's a lot...

1726
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,540
For farming.

1727
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:35,200
There's a lot of coal in the...

1728
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,280
What else do you need?

1729
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,780
My arm is fully ready.

1730
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,920
I still need my helmet and my pants.

1731
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,160
And then I was gonna do my...

1732
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,180
And then I was gonna get the infinity on the book.

1733
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,600
So you could have...

1734
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,100
I was gonna let you have it.

1735
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,700
No, I don't need it.

1736
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:53,540
You can...

1737
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,200
You can have infinity and then...

1738
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,020
My bow is already power.

1739
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,380
I already have power on my bow.

1740
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,540
You can put infinity on it too.

1741
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,480
That's fine, I don't need it.

1742
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:05,560
I actually don't need it.

1743
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:07,500
I have enough arrows.

1744
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:11,900
But you'll be using more of the arrows than me, probably.

1745
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:13,920
I have 45.

1746
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:14,980
So it's fine.

1747
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:18,640
I have 45 normal arrows.

1748
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,520
And then 20 spectral arrows.

1749
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:22,600
20...

1750
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,960
I don't think spectral arrows do more damage.

1751
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,000
Yeah, but it's just arrows.

1752
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:28,960
Lucky.

1753
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:30,460
That's fine.

1754
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,420
I don't need another infinity.

1755
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,060
I think we should just go with whatever...

1756
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,800
Try to level up all your stuff.

1757
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:38,140
And then...

1758
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,420
Like all your armor, because I'm done, I think.

1759
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:41,980
Sorry, kid.

1760
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,340
Sorry, you have no mom anymore.

1761
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,600
I'm so sorry.

1762
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:48,820
This is fine.

1763
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:49,760
Guys, believe.

1764
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,540
Believe in this.

1765
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,280
I don't think they believe in this.

1766
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:55,140
Guys, believe.

1767
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,720
I've done this before.

1768
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,260
Guys, believe.

1769
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,220
I've done this before.

1770
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,480
I think I once soloed the ender dragon.

1771
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,720
Yeah, I think you did, actually.

1772
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:07,360
I remember.

1773
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,920
I feel like I did that.

1774
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,460
But I had, like, way better stuff.

1775
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,160
That's true.

1776
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:15,140
Didn't you have netherite stuff?

1777
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,820
Oh, I also have to... Oh, shit.

1778
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:17,360
I'm gonna...

1779
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:19,340
Oh, God.

1780
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,580
I'm not... I'm kind of lost.

1781
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:22,960
Oh, no.

1782
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:23,840
The sun's coming down.

1783
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,360
Okay, coordinates are...

1784
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:28,100
I can't look at it yet, because I'm in bed.

1785
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:28,580
Oh, I see it.

1786
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:29,000
Never mind.

1787
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:29,340
I'm coming.

1788
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,140
No, Mint.

1789
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,860
You got the infinity, right?

1790
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,020
You already got it on your own.

1791
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,920
No, I haven't put it on yet, but I will...

1792
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,580
Yeah.

1793
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,400
I'm coming to bed.

1794
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:45,560
I'm almost there.

1795
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:50,260
I lit up the area a little bit, so it should be, like, not so dangerous.

1796
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,580
I'm on my way.

1797
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,560
I'm sleeping.

1798
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,300
I'm eating.

1799
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,080
My chat doesn't...

1800
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,940
My chat doesn't...

1801
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:03,560
They don't believe.

1802
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,140
They're like, yeah, you're cooked, but you might win.

1803
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,760
What the hell?

1804
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:08,720
Believe?

1805
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,680
This is our one run.

1806
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:11,940
Why?

1807
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,260
We have one run.

1808
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:15,740
Why don't you believe?

1809
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:19,080
Why don't you believe in us?

1810
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,260
Oh, my God.

1811
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,700
We have one run.

1812
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,660
You have to believe in us.

1813
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,480
You have to believe in us.

1814
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,600
Please believe in us.

1815
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,200
I have no faith in us.

1816
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:35,860
We need this wood.

1817
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:39,340
Okay, I'm gonna put, like, trash stuff in my inventory that I don't need.

1818
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:40,680
Okay, I need the torch.

1819
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,620
I need this.

1820
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,300
I don't need the gold helmet anymore.

1821
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,260
I'm gonna grab wood just in case.

1822
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:47,560
I don't need...

1823
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,540
I'll grab this just in case, too.

1824
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,400
And then get the bed.

1825
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:52,600
Get this out of here.

1826
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,100
Get the wood rid of this.

1827
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:54,860
We need coal.

1828
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,300
We don't need this.

1829
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,540
We don't need this.

1830
01:09:58,540 --> 01:09:59,980
We have this.

1831
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:01,680
This is fine.

1832
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:02,700
We don't need this.

1833
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,280
We don't need this.

1834
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,020
Have you guys found the end portal?

1835
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,400
Are we gonna do that the moment we're finished kidding ourselves about?

1836
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,180
We're gonna get that into that.

1837
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:19,440
I'm gonna make the end pearl things into the thing.

1838
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,780
Okay, I have one, two, three, four, five beds.

1839
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:22,700
That's enough beds.

1840
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:23,660
Eye of Ender.

1841
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,800
Oh, you should make that, actually, right?

1842
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,340
I'm making the eyes of the ender.

1843
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, I have seven beds.

1844
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,120
I have seven beds.

1845
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:37,300
I don't think... I think you need like a twenty... Isn't it like a ton of beds, you guys?

1846
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:37,740
I don't know.

1847
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:38,460
Oh my gosh.

1848
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,200
We have these two beds.

1849
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:40,740
Eight, nine.

1850
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,760
We have nine beds.

1851
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:42,320
It's okay.

1852
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,160
We'll just do it with our power.

1853
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,720
Wait, do you have extra iron or no?

1854
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,020
I can make iron ingots.

1855
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:48,800
No, I don't have any.

1856
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:49,160
Okay.

1857
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:52,800
I think I have enough for... Do I have enough for...

1858
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,780
Okay, one.

1859
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:56,860
How many for a bucket?

1860
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,200
We're already an hour in.

1861
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,120
We need three.

1862
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,680
Okay, so I need two more.

1863
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,240
I need...

1864
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:06,940
Wait.

1865
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:09,540
Oh no.

1866
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,100
I don't have enough.

1867
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,240
I only have one bucket.

1868
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:14,880
Eye of the ender.

1869
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:15,900
Do you have a bucket on you?

1870
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:16,940
Yeah, I have one bucket.

1871
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,200
Okay, we both have a bucket, so it should be fine.

1872
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,720
I think we need more.

1873
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,680
Don't we need to...

1874
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:25,140
Don't we need to cover the ground with water?

1875
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:28,080
That's our one bucket for.

1876
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,880
That's not gonna cover the whole ground.

1877
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,180
We don't have enough iron.

1878
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,700
We actually don't have enough iron.

1879
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,660
Unless I swim.

1880
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,660
Time to find iron.

1881
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,240
Two by two infinite water.

1882
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,000
Will that work?

1883
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,980
We need four buckets of water then, right?

1884
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,560
We need four buckets of water to make the two by two.

1885
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:58,840
We just need two?

1886
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,020
We both have two.

1887
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,960
We just need to make sure we don't fuck up the infinite water source.

1888
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,040
Alright, let's fucking...

1889
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:11,900
We only have one!

1890
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,100
One bucket?

1891
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:15,720
No, we have two!

1892
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,320
I mean, we only have one chance for this.

1893
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:25,000
And if we don't succeed, people are gonna see the two vods and be like, oh, of course they made it.

1894
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:29,940
They're not gonna watch this at the end, right?

1895
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:30,720
They're not gonna...

1896
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:34,360
We could just cut it and say that we had streaming issues.

1897
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,400
But we didn't.

1898
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:37,980
Take a screenshot on Google.

1899
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:39,220
Yeah, yeah.

1900
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:41,760
We can photoshop our characters in it.

1901
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:48,000
We can hire someone on Fiverr to paint it with our skins.

1902
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:59,240
We've just put in the new video when we made it different.

1903
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,100
We managed to record it.

1904
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,840
We managed to record the final fight.

1905
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,460
And then we upload it as a video and then nobody will know.

1906
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,460
How would they know?

1907
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,340
How would they know?

1908
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,120
So we need iron.

1909
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:20,980
I'm gonna go look for some more coal, too.

1910
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,420
I need to just get a little bit more level.

1911
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:25,560
How much more levels do you need?

1912
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,020
One, but I'm at 29.

1913
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:32,260
But like...

1914
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:33,520
At the lower end, 29?

1915
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:34,220
Yeah.

1916
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:36,360
Did you grab everything for cooking?

1917
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,180
Yeah.

1918
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,100
Okay, I'm grabbing this copper then.

1919
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,340
So I can cook it for you.

1920
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:43,780
And you just grab the stuff.

1921
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,280
Okay.

1922
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,780
I'm searching.

1923
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:50,100
Wait, so do you think I shouldn't get infinity then?

1924
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:50,760
Or should I?

1925
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:51,880
No, you should get infinity.

1926
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,320
I think infinity is more important.

1927
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,620
Okay, I'll get infinity and I'll...

1928
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:58,240
So then I can give you the arrow and then you do the infinity stuff.

1929
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:59,360
Okay.

1930
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,540
I'll do infinity.

1931
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:06,160
And I'll just do like a second level for my...

1932
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,100
For my helmet and my pants.

1933
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:10,580
And then we can...

1934
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:13,560
We can head off into the...

1935
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:18,320
You know, if we lose this run and we do it again, I will not be surprised if it's easier.

1936
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:19,960
I wouldn't.

1937
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:20,660
I won't?

1938
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:21,640
Yeah, I feel like if...

1939
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,640
I feel like...

1940
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:28,100
I feel like we've gotten the bad end of the stick in a lot of these.

1941
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:31,540
I think we just got the worst seed possible.

1942
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:32,600
I think so too.

1943
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:37,000
Maybe we should just die right now and restart with a new seed and it'll be easier.

1944
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,420
Maybe we should just do that.

1945
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:46,080
We're gonna die.

1946
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,160
At least die at the dragon.

1947
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:47,960
At least die.

1948
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:51,380
At that point, let's just go find the stronghold.

1949
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:53,100
What if we die in the little stronghold?

1950
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,600
Let's just find the stronghold at that point.

1951
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,700
Like, fuck getting anything else.

1952
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:01,000
Why is there nothing around here?

1953
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:02,400
This area sucks.

1954
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,020
Wait, wait, wait.

1955
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:06,380
We bring the enchantment table and the books with us.

1956
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,980
To the stronghold.

1957
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,340
And then we can get XP at the stronghold.

1958
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:13,060
Oh, true.

1959
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:14,300
Yeah.

1960
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,400
Okay, we can do that.

1961
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:20,960
Just grab everything that we're gonna bring to the...

1962
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,540
So are we picking up shop or leaving now?

1963
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,780
You're packing up shop.

1964
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:25,340
This is it.

1965
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:26,680
This is the final hour.

1966
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:31,340
Wait, don't you need a silk touch to get ready to take out the...

1967
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,000
Take out what?

1968
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,120
The enchantment table.

1969
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,020
Wait, really?

1970
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,680
You need silk touch?

1971
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:38,860
Oh, I also might lose...

1972
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:42,820
Wait, if you break the enchantment table, you reset the enchantment?

1973
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,220
Yeah, I'll lose infinity.

1974
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,600
Okay, let's just make a new enchantment table.

1975
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:49,280
I have enough diamonds.

1976
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,640
Alright, saying goodbye to...

1977
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,400
Wait, what do we need for enchantment tables?

1978
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,880
We need...

1979
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,000
We also need the bookshelves.

1980
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:59,140
Three obsidian...

1981
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:00,760
Yeah, bookshelves we can remake easily.

1982
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,040
Okay, we just get more book...

1983
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,320
I mean, more wood.

1984
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:07,660
Okay.

1985
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:11,140
Oh, it was not five days.

1986
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,060
It was much longer than five days.

1987
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:17,180
I remember watching that stream.

1988
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:20,460
I remember it taking much longer.

1989
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,800
But yeah, there's a library in the stronghold.

1990
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:25,880
Oh, I can mine it?

1991
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:27,760
People are saying I can break the enchantment table.

1992
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:28,920
You can?

1993
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,920
I thought you need a silk touch one.

1994
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,720
You can mine it?

1995
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:41,940
But I don't have silk touch.

1996
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,260
Oh, I guess you can mine it.

1997
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,940
Oh, just maybe people are...

1998
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:49,140
Someone says don't, others say don't.

1999
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,260
Some says yes.

2000
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,760
Get infinity first before...

2001
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,280
Wait, she doesn't have the levels.

2002
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,800
They're saying you can mine it.

2003
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:07,100
When you get rid of it, I won't have infinity.

2004
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,060
Oh, you don't have your infinity.

2005
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:09,320
Yeah, you're right.

2006
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,280
Ah, what do we do?

2007
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:13,800
You need one level, right?

2008
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,220
Okay, I'll put stuff in the...

2009
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:16,760
How much more from that one level?

2010
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:18,480
I'm going back into the nether.

2011
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,420
No, don't do it.

2012
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,140
It's too risky.

2013
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:25,240
How much more do you need?

2014
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,220
I need a lot.

2015
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,900
You need a lot?

2016
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:29,180
A lot, a lot.

2017
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,800
How much is a lot, a lot?

2018
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:33,260
I think I need to go back and I'm going in.

2019
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:33,780
No!

2020
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,880
Wait, can you come with and build a wall, right?

2021
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:41,180
So that if a gas spawns by the...

2022
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:42,900
I'll build a house around it.

2023
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,640
Yeah, build like an ugly house.

2024
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:45,460
I need stuff.

2025
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:46,820
I'm gonna get dirt.

2026
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:48,180
Okay, yeah, yeah.

2027
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:51,840
You can go in person, because you'll be walking away from it, right?

2028
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,020
Okay.

2029
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,740
Where did I put the shovel?

2030
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,020
Okay, I'm gonna go grab dirt and then build stuff around it.

2031
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,200
I think I see some quartz.

2032
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,520
Oh, shit.

2033
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,440
There's already a gas.

2034
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,040
No, there's already a gas.

2035
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:07,920
I'm grabbing dirt.

2036
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,560
I'm grabbing dirt as fast as I can.

2037
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,120
I'm grabbing dirt as fast as I can.

2038
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,240
I can't use the wood, guys.

2039
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,980
The wood is for something else I'm trying to make.

2040
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:18,200
The wood is for something else I'm trying to make right now.

2041
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,180
Okay.

2042
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:23,940
I'm digging like kind of a hole for me, so that...

2043
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:24,220
I'm digging like kind of a hole for me, so that...

2044
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:31,260
Oh, oh, my pickaxe just broke.

2045
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,100
Oh, no, I'm coming in.

2046
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:35,760
I'm giving you my pickaxe.

2047
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:36,060
Okay.

2048
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,880
You can find me in a hole.

2049
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,180
Here, this way.

2050
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,180
Do you see me?

2051
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,500
Give me a sec, I'm building the house first.

2052
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,340
I think maybe he despawned.

2053
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,360
I don't hear him anymore.

2054
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,060
I don't hear him either.

2055
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:02,360
Can I have your pickaxe?

2056
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,900
Yeah, just give me a sec, I'm building my little house.

2057
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,260
Yeah, okay.

2058
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,400
That works, yeah.

2059
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:11,960
Thank you.

2060
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,080
Just for a moment.

2061
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,960
Alright, I'm grabbing more dirt.

2062
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:19,140
Okay.

2063
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:19,340
Okay.

2064
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,080
I'm just gonna sleep through this night, too.

2065
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,580
Oh, my God, I do hear still the gas.

2066
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,140
I hear him.

2067
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:32,060
I know, I'm grabbing more stuff for the house.

2068
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,440
I'm mining the dirt.

2069
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,680
I ran out of dirt.

2070
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:37,500
Okay, I'm almost halfway.

2071
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:43,580
Where is he?

2072
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,480
I'm just gonna get 40 and then go back in.

2073
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,540
Oh, I see him over there.

2074
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,880
Cobblestones, I can't get cobblestones.

2075
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,220
I don't have cobblestone.

2076
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:55,220
I don't have my pickaxe anymore.

2077
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,100
And we don't have iron.

2078
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,240
Oh, God.

2079
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:00,680
Where is he?

2080
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:05,140
Oh, there he is.

2081
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:09,810
Please despawn.

2082
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:12,170
Please despawn.

2083
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:12,950
You ugly.

2084
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:17,710
Please despawn.

2085
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:21,370
Okay, he might despawn now.

2086
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:23,610
Oh, my God.

2087
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:25,630
I'm in my little hole.

2088
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:26,810
I'm in my little hole.

2089
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:30,490
I'm in my little hole.

2090
01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:33,610
I'm in my hole.

2091
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:38,030
There was one more quartz area that I think I can get to.

2092
01:20:38,650 --> 01:20:39,310
Is he gone?

2093
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:40,710
No, he's not gone.

2094
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:41,910
No, he's not gone.

2095
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:43,350
I don't know.

2096
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:44,790
Just stay in your little hole.

2097
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:48,110
You know what?

2098
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:48,990
I'm just gonna mine.

2099
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:50,830
I'm just gonna strip mine here.

2100
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:53,990
And then maybe I'll hit quartz.

2101
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:55,630
Safely.

2102
01:20:58,110 --> 01:20:58,590
Perhaps.

2103
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:01,370
I'm gonna mine some more dirt for us.

2104
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:03,290
Oh, my God.

2105
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:04,330
Please go away.

2106
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:08,150
I just gotta get a few...

2107
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:10,110
I just gotta get a few more...

2108
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:12,430
of experience, guys.

2109
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:15,150
It's just almost there.

2110
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,690
Did you get quartz?

2111
01:21:17,450 --> 01:21:18,290
Don't burn.

2112
01:21:18,850 --> 01:21:19,790
I'm trying not to.

2113
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:25,570
In fact, maybe I can mine it from here.

2114
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:25,930
Oh, thank God.

2115
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:30,110
Alright, I'm going through the portal to see if he's there.

2116
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:31,530
I think he is.

2117
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:33,510
Don't say that.

2118
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:39,210
I'm being as safe as I possibly can.

2119
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:42,630
Oh!

2120
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:44,150
So close to 30.

2121
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:44,890
So close.

2122
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:50,900
Oh, my God.

2123
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,200
I'm so close to level 30.

2124
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:53,480
There you go.

2125
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:55,340
I feel a little bit more safe now.

2126
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:56,740
Oh, more quartz.

2127
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:57,600
Okay.

2128
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:59,040
There we go.

2129
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:01,980
We're a little safer now.

2130
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:05,820
I made a little hut.

2131
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,320
I got to level 30.

2132
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:08,700
I made a little hut.

2133
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:12,160
I can do infinity now.

2134
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:13,440
Yeah!

2135
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:17,540
I'm going to put torches for you so you know this is where we live.

2136
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:18,080
Okay.

2137
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:20,160
I think I know, but...

2138
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,320
Alright, here we go.

2139
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,380
There's all the torches.

2140
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,780
There's all the torches in the world.

2141
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,280
I wish I was farming quartz.

2142
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,940
I'd be rich in quartz.

2143
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:32,200
I wish we...

2144
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,160
Alright, is the gas still there?

2145
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:34,780
I wish we died earlier.

2146
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:35,980
I don't know.

2147
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,140
I wish we...

2148
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,340
I wish we didn't stayed in this seed.

2149
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:41,620
I know, me too.

2150
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,740
I wish we died in the nether.

2151
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:46,380
In the very beginning of the nether.

2152
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:46,940
Me too!

2153
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,180
No, not in the very beginning of the nether!

2154
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,540
It would be so long from now.

2155
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:53,600
Okay, I'm back.

2156
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:55,780
Oh, where is it?

2157
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:56,280
Where are you?

2158
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,420
You know what I also wish?

2159
01:22:58,240 --> 01:22:58,940
Here's your pickaxe.

2160
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:01,220
I wish we got out of the mines earlier.

2161
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:03,060
I wish we got...

2162
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:05,640
Do you regret what you did in the mines?

2163
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:06,800
Here, take your pickaxe.

2164
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,420
Do you regret what you did in the mines?

2165
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,380
I regret this entire event.

2166
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:14,920
I regret everything.

2167
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,400
Wait, why can't I do infinity?

2168
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,560
Oh, three lapis.

2169
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:22,180
Oh, that's why.

2170
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:22,540
Okay.

2171
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,020
Okay, I got infinity.

2172
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:27,140
I put it on my block.

2173
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:28,220
It's already time to break.

2174
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,260
I'll break it now.

2175
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,180
I'm breaking it.

2176
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:32,580
Okay.

2177
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:34,760
Okay.

2178
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:36,360
I got the enchanting table.

2179
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,840
And then I'm gonna grab the bookcases too.

2180
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:41,900
Bing bong bing.

2181
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:43,480
Okay.

2182
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,620
Name it?

2183
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,000
No!

2184
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:48,760
My levels are precious!

2185
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,940
I'm not gonna waste a single level on a name.

2186
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:53,940
His name is Bow.

2187
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,860
I'm gonna remake the bookshelf.

2188
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:58,440
I think...

2189
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:02,680
I really think, Doki, this bow would be better with you, since it's a powerful bow.

2190
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,940
Mine has power 4.

2191
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,760
And mine has unbreaking 3 also.

2192
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,760
Only unbreaking 3?

2193
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:15,340
What's yours unbreaking?

2194
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,100
Mine has power 4.

2195
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,920
Mine has power 4, unbreaking 3, and infinity.

2196
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:22,360
Oh, okay.

2197
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,300
There you go.

2198
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:27,940
One and done?

2199
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,040
Oh my god.

2200
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,520
This is embarrassing.

2201
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,900
I don't want this thing.

2202
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,820
What the hell?

2203
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:42,900
Why is it embarrassing?

2204
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,540
Here's your fucking arrows.

2205
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:46,060
Oh, thank you.

2206
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:48,620
You have arrows?

2207
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:49,860
You have one arrow?

2208
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:51,060
Yeah, I have one arrow.

2209
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,460
Do you want spectral arrows too?

2210
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,140
No, no, it's okay.

2211
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,820
Why is it...

2212
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:59,120
No, we can't combine the bows, guys!

2213
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,820
Because Mint needs the bows too.

2214
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:02,580
Yeah!

2215
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,900
She needs the bows as well.

2216
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,360
I need the bows.

2217
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:14,100
It's telling us to combine the bow with the mintues.

2218
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:16,320
They're trying to sabotage us.

2219
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:29,220
Alright.

2220
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:30,800
Did you make the eye of ender?

2221
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,640
Yeah.

2222
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:41,100
Don't do the bed strap because it's not good and only for speedrunners.

2223
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,220
Look, I've done the bed strap before.

2224
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,660
You have?

2225
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:51,020
Yeah, we've done it together during that run we had.

2226
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:52,360
I didn't do it.

2227
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,360
No, I didn't do it.

2228
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:56,720
Didn't we do it?

2229
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:57,680
I thought I did.

2230
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:58,880
I don't think so.

2231
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:01,100
Pretty sure.

2232
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,930
It could kill us.

2233
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:08,090
Yeah, that's what I'm feeling.

2234
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:10,330
Okay, I'll get rid of the beds.

2235
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:10,990
Fine.

2236
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:13,550
I'll get rid of them.

2237
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,470
I don't have any...

2238
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:18,610
You guys, I gave away my infinity bow.

2239
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:20,250
That's why I have all the arrows.

2240
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:20,910
I gave...

2241
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:24,050
Oh, man.

2242
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:26,010
I think some people are more tired than me.

2243
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:28,670
Alright, I'm gonna...

2244
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:29,810
Alright, let me...

2245
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:30,930
I'm just making...

2246
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:34,790
Okay, bookshelf.

2247
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:37,530
I'm just remaking the shelves for us.

2248
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:42,010
We're not enough wood?

2249
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:42,830
Do you have wood or no?

2250
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:46,290
Not a lot of wood, no.

2251
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:48,270
Okay, I'll just farm the last trees here.

2252
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:48,790
Yeah.

2253
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:50,790
And then we'll head over.

2254
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:52,810
We'll head over.

2255
01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:54,610
Please, it's 440.

2256
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:57,150
It's 540 for me.

2257
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:57,250
Okay.

2258
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:02,630
The sun's almost up, guys.

2259
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:05,190
Yeah.

2260
01:27:08,970 --> 01:27:09,990
Let's see.

2261
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:11,650
Wood.

2262
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:14,090
I can't do much more.

2263
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:17,910
That's why we have the last rug.

2264
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:21,410
Me too.

2265
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:23,210
Me too.

2266
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:26,010
I thought we'd be at the dragon by now.

2267
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:27,790
I don't know why we're still here.

2268
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:29,770
Okay, then let's go.

2269
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:31,350
I didn't realize...

2270
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:34,590
I didn't realize how under-leveled we were.

2271
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:36,330
I thought we leveled up so much.

2272
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:37,330
I told you.

2273
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:38,490
I told you.

2274
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:40,930
You had the same amount of wood.

2275
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:44,750
I know, but I told you we needed so so many.

2276
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:48,850
There were so many cords that we didn't pick up.

2277
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:51,170
We were so stuck.

2278
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:53,070
They were so long.

2279
01:27:53,070 --> 01:27:53,990
What?

2280
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:58,250
Don't forget the potions.

2281
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:01,930
Why didn't the chat tell us to pick up the cords?

2282
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:08,050
Yeah, why didn't the chat tell us to pick up the cords?

2283
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:13,890
You guys should have been saying, Hey, you can need more levels.

2284
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:15,070
Get the cords.

2285
01:28:15,070 --> 01:28:17,190
Yeah, get more of the cords.

2286
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:18,690
Get more of the cords.

2287
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:20,210
Get more of them.

2288
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:23,310
You should have said, Give more of the cords, chat.

2289
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:27,250
If you said, give more of the cords, I would have got more of the cords.

2290
01:28:27,790 --> 01:28:29,810
We would have been like, oh yeah, that's a good plan.

2291
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:32,190
We need the cords for the...

2292
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:33,950
We need the cords for that.

2293
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:35,790
Why didn't you get those?

2294
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:37,770
I didn't know.

2295
01:28:40,410 --> 01:28:44,130
Chat, why didn't you tell us about the cords?

2296
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,970
Do you think my sword will last, you guys?

2297
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:50,980
Just...

2298
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:52,540
Okay, what potions do I get?

2299
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:54,400
Potion regeneration.

2300
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,320
You made so many.

2301
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:56,860
Yeah.

2302
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:00,120
You don't get all of them.

2303
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:01,140
Half and half.

2304
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,540
That's not half, but okay.

2305
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:12,160
I got two for five for regen, and then two for four for slow falling.

2306
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:15,080
Yeah, that's half.

2307
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:15,940
It's literally half.

2308
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,240
What the fuck are you talking about?

2309
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:21,260
You have five for both, and I have four.

2310
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:27,380
I have two for five for regen, and then two for four for slow falling.

2311
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,820
Okay, so you're giving me slow... Okay, I get it.

2312
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,280
Should we just...

2313
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,100
Should I make more?

2314
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:34,860
I can...

2315
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:36,040
No, I think we're fine.

2316
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,520
It's not gonna take us that long.

2317
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,600
It's four minutes each.

2318
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,400
We're not gonna take 30 minutes to kill this dragon.

2319
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:47,040
We either die within 10 minutes, or we do something in 10 minutes.

2320
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,960
It's one or the other.

2321
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,960
We die in 10 minutes.

2322
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,440
Okay, we gotta sleep in the bed before we fucking leave.

2323
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:56,980
Another rock?

2324
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:59,120
He'll blow it up, right?

2325
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:01,220
What?

2326
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:05,180
Someone just said...

2327
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:06,940
This message got delayed.

2328
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,180
Pick up the quartz.

2329
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:08,560
What?

2330
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,540
We would've been like level 70.

2331
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,260
We would've been so good.

2332
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:36,180
I'm gonna grab netherrack for like when we...

2333
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:38,240
When we need to climb.

2334
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:41,900
Did you grab the enderpearl and eye of ender stuff?

2335
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,120
Yeah, I have all that.

2336
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:45,100
I'm gonna grab your potions.

2337
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:46,380
Yeah, I know.

2338
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,500
I'm making space.

2339
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,480
I'm making space.

2340
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:00,360
I'm gonna bring the brewing stand just in case.

2341
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:02,500
Oh, pickaxe?

2342
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:03,100
Yeah, I need that.

2343
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,380
You have a lot of wood, right?

2344
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:05,900
I have 14.

2345
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:10,720
We can grab some while we're fucking heading over to the stronghold wherever it is.

2346
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:15,000
We're just gonna be so many trees.

2347
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:16,920
Okay, I'll get rid of that.

2348
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,040
Hold on, guys.

2349
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:18,500
Sorry.

2350
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,500
I'm putting stuff away.

2351
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:22,780
I'm making stuff.

2352
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:23,360
Let's see.

2353
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:24,680
Oh, wait.

2354
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:25,600
I'll take my sticks.

2355
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:28,680
Grab blocks while we're on the way, chat.

2356
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,780
There's so many blocks ahead of us.

2357
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,280
We can grab blocks while we're going there.

2358
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:34,520
There we go.

2359
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,280
I got water.

2360
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:38,900
You got all the food?

2361
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:40,180
We gotta get the food.

2362
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:40,940
I got...

2363
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:41,520
44.

2364
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,820
I think you have the...

2365
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:45,000
Chicken, right?

2366
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:47,520
I got the beefs and the chickens, yeah.

2367
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:49,320
I had pork chop and mutton.

2368
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:50,780
So we can split that.

2369
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:51,560
You take those.

2370
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:52,360
I take the others.

2371
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:53,900
Take the beds.

2372
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,200
There's so much we can do to prepare.

2373
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,800
There's so little time left in our bodies.

2374
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:00,380
Yeah.

2375
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:03,320
Our bodies are gonna expire soon.

2376
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:04,120
We don't have...

2377
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,620
We don't have the time to prep more.

2378
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,600
I'm taking the melons until the fight.

2379
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,380
I want the melons to just keep...

2380
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:14,820
Two different types of tiredness from Min and I.

2381
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:15,800
Min is the...

2382
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,320
I'm gonna fucking pass out.

2383
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:21,200
I am hysterical and I'm delusional right now.

2384
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:22,800
I'm a type of tired.

2385
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:24,780
I'm delulu at the moment.

2386
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:25,580
Delulu.

2387
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,820
Two types of tiredness from us.

2388
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,480
Yeah, we don't need the NHS.

2389
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:32,860
We don't need it.

2390
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,820
They're telling us we need an ender chest?

2391
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:38,200
It's for more room, but we don't.

2392
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,560
We don't need it.

2393
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:41,720
No, we're fine.

2394
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,020
We do need it.

2395
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:44,640
Well, I have one other shield.

2396
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,160
Okay, I actually have two shields.

2397
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,060
Maybe I'll be okay.

2398
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:51,180
Wait, can I put something in my little bundle?

2399
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:53,280
Can I put...

2400
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,280
Oh, what the hell?

2401
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:56,260
Oh, I can put the food in the bundle.

2402
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,400
Oh, that's smart.

2403
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:00,660
Oh, it's full.

2404
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:01,800
This thing sucks.

2405
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:05,220
Maybe we should have made an ender chest.

2406
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:08,080
Do we have enough ender pearls for an ender chest though?

2407
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:08,820
That's the thing.

2408
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,460
No, we need to save all eyes of ender.

2409
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:12,980
We need to save all of them.

2410
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:13,340
Yeah, okay.

2411
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,800
I'm ready.

2412
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,520
I'm missing one slow falling pot...

2413
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:19,900
You know what?

2414
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:20,820
Fine, go waste it.

2415
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:21,080
Okay.

2416
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:23,320
Actually, I'm gonna make...

2417
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:27,240
Wait, even if I make a pickaxe, I can't take it.

2418
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:33,920
We need these pearls, you guys.

2419
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:35,460
We need these for...

2420
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:36,260
We need them.

2421
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,660
We'll make the chest with...

2422
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:40,660
I mean, it wouldn't matter by then.

2423
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:41,640
The bundle for the pearls.

2424
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,080
How do I take stuff out?

2425
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:44,620
Oh, there we go.

2426
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:45,280
Okay, hold on.

2427
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:48,520
Oh no, only one.

2428
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,400
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

2429
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:57,920
Whippy!

2430
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,020
No, I'm taking the...

2431
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:03,380
You guys, we're making the...

2432
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:06,800
We're remaking the enchantment table so when we get there...

2433
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,040
Yeah, yeah, I have everything.

2434
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:10,420
I have the enchantment table and I have 15 bookshelves.

2435
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,400
And I have lapis lazuli.

2436
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:15,080
Actually, well, get books there.

2437
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:15,960
No...

2438
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:16,560
Oh, that's true.

2439
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:18,340
I already made 15.

2440
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,020
It's fine.

2441
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,800
It's in my pocket.

2442
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:22,680
It's fine.

2443
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:25,940
I feel like we just find...

2444
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:28,780
Straight up find the fucking thing and then...

2445
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:31,060
Put the pearls in there and then...

2446
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:32,700
We call it and then we go in there.

2447
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,540
We either kill the dragon or we die.

2448
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:36,700
And then we try this again in another game.

2449
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,380
Why do people keep saying the pearls?

2450
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,240
I'm so confused.

2451
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:40,880
I have all the pearls.

2452
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,880
This is all the pearls.

2453
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:45,820
How many more pearls do we need?

2454
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,260
Oh, wait, there's so many more in here.

2455
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:49,360
I didn't even notice them.

2456
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:50,140
Wait, hold on.

2457
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:52,020
Wait, the ones that I gave?

2458
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:54,020
Yeah, those are the ones I put down there.

2459
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:55,280
Oh, I didn't even see.

2460
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:55,900
Okay, hold on.

2461
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:57,420
I need to make way more things.

2462
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:57,900
Hold on.

2463
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:58,320
Okay.

2464
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:00,820
Oh, my God.

2465
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,160
I didn't even see these.

2466
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:03,000
Oh, my God.

2467
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:03,920
I put them in the beginning.

2468
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:04,740
I told you.

2469
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:05,900
I didn't see them.

2470
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:06,640
That's alright.

2471
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:07,620
We've lost our minds.

2472
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:08,060
Yeah.

2473
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:12,280
We've spent enough.

2474
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:14,700
We've spent enough.

2475
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,760
We've spent enough, guys.

2476
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,080
Oh, I didn't know there was more.

2477
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:22,040
If we don't make it this run...

2478
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:23,640
We'll try again another time.

2479
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,420
I'm not gonna bring the brewing.

2480
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:27,700
I'm not gonna bring the brewing.

2481
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:29,880
We'll do the stream in the morning instead.

2482
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:30,640
No.

2483
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:33,760
No, I'm not touching my...

2484
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,540
No, I'm not meant tomorrow.

2485
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,640
I meant like another time.

2486
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:38,940
We'll start it in the morning.

2487
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:39,880
In the future.

2488
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,620
We'll try again.

2489
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:44,960
We'll try again in the future.

2490
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:45,460
In the future.

2491
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:47,540
Alright.

2492
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,740
I need to make a pickaxe now.

2493
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:51,920
Oh, I can't.

2494
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,520
I'm gonna make a diamond one.

2495
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:55,140
You have enough?

2496
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:58,280
Yeah, I think so.

2497
01:35:58,380 --> 01:35:59,360
Where did my sticks go?

2498
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:00,680
I have my sticks.

2499
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:02,200
No, guys.

2500
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:06,080
We're not gonna do it in Atlanta, guys.

2501
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,100
We have other things to do.

2502
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:16,020
They're like, Hey, how about you do a whole concert and then also stream for 24 hours?

2503
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,680
Wouldn't that be super cool?

2504
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:19,680
Yeah, it'll be so fun.

2505
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:21,840
Oh, my God.

2506
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:28,880
I have like experience now with this.

2507
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,140
It won't be that bad.

2508
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:31,340
Oh, my God.

2509
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:33,960
That's the funniest thing ever.

2510
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:38,920
We learned so much from this one playthrough.

2511
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:40,780
Are you not bringing the beds?

2512
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,600
No, they keep telling us that we're gonna die.

2513
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:45,980
Then it's fine.

2514
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,940
We don't need the beds.

2515
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:49,500
Do you think we might need a bed to head over there?

2516
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:50,700
Yeah, bring a bed to sleep.

2517
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,900
Alright, I'm throwing away my one iron.

2518
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:54,960
Alright, I'm ready.

2519
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:55,940
I'm ready.

2520
01:36:56,480 --> 01:37:00,160
Throw it up into the air and say I don't care.

2521
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,360
I don't care.

2522
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:05,260
I'm going up in the air.

2523
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:06,780
I'm going up high.

2524
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:09,960
Throw it in the air and tell the world that you don't care.

2525
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:12,760
Are you gonna say bye to your dads or whatever?

2526
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:14,960
What?

2527
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:15,780
Your dogs.

2528
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:17,060
Oh shit, my dogs.

2529
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:17,740
Get over here.

2530
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:19,680
I almost forgot you guys existed.

2531
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:22,860
I fucking thought you guys died because I was XP crazy.

2532
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:25,020
Catch it.

2533
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:25,240
Wait.

2534
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:26,900
Do I just throw it or do I...

2535
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:27,780
How do I do this?

2536
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:30,100
Sometimes it doesn't break.

2537
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,260
Do I just throw it in the air?

2538
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:39,300
Throw it in the air and tell the world you don't care.

2539
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:42,220
Oh, this way.

2540
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:44,660
Oh, it didn't break.

2541
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:45,800
Grab it.

2542
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:47,080
I don't have space.

2543
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,160
You gotta grab it.

2544
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,380
Okay, I'll grab it.

2545
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:53,440
Alright.

2546
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:55,160
Let's go.

2547
01:37:58,620 --> 01:37:59,180
Alright.

2548
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:01,260
Let's go.

2549
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,000
Let's go, I guess.

2550
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:04,760
Let's go.

2551
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:08,740
I roll to here and then you throw it in the air.

2552
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:10,260
Oh, that's it.

2553
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:10,920
Oh, okay.

2554
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:11,000
Okay.

2555
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,340
Goodbye, PP Tower.

2556
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:16,060
Goodbye.

2557
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:18,820
Do you really need to be up top while you throw it?

2558
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:19,720
Can you just throw it here?

2559
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:23,140
No, it's better to throw it up in a high place.

2560
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,560
Throw it in the air.

2561
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:29,240
And tell the world you don't care.

2562
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,640
Where are you?

2563
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:33,440
I'm here.

2564
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:35,880
Let's just go longer.

2565
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:39,140
Alright, we'll go longer after this.

2566
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:39,440
No!

2567
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:41,480
Oh, it's this way.

2568
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,140
Thank God I didn't go longer.

2569
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,020
Oh, it's in the tree.

2570
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:48,960
Goddammit.

2571
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:51,780
Is it this way?

2572
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:53,960
Right here?

2573
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:56,980
Yeah, it's like a diagonal.

2574
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:57,920
It's like this way.

2575
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:00,220
That's a new dog.

2576
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,900
I told you there were dogs over here.

2577
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:03,860
Come on, come on.

2578
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:04,920
Don't get distracted.

2579
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:05,520
We're going.

2580
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:06,560
I'm going.

2581
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:08,700
I'm heading over.

2582
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:10,620
We're going.

2583
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:17,300
They actually passed over the stronghold on the way back from the long nether trip?

2584
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,120
How would we know that?

2585
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,600
How would we know that?

2586
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,420
How would we know that?

2587
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:25,580
How would we know that?

2588
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:26,980
How do you know that?

2589
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,420
Why did no one said anything?

2590
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:33,560
Why did no one super aka super us and be like, That's the stronghold!

2591
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:36,260
Hey, there's the stronghold right there!

2592
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:42,940
Seed checker?

2593
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,140
They don't know the seed?

2594
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:46,380
Hey, where are you?

2595
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:50,560
Where are you?

2596
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:52,580
I'm walking in the...

2597
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:55,180
Come on, he like haven't even...

2598
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:57,480
He haven't even made it to...

2599
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,860
I'm making a tower.

2600
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:13,860
We went back towards home!

2601
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,640
We already went and said goodbye.

2602
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:17,500
It's so awkward.

2603
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:19,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2604
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:20,360
Give me your coordinates.

2605
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:25,840
Apparently while I had my coordinates...

2606
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:31,140
Because of the biome.

2607
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:33,560
They saw the biome!

2608
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:36,340
Why did you guys not say anything?

2609
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:41,300
Negative 4211899.

2610
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:43,620
421...

2611
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:45,940
Just sleep, just sleep.

2612
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,500
Just sleep.

2613
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:52,440
You didn't ask!

2614
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:55,760
Oh my god, this is the most Metal Gear ass.

2615
01:40:58,020 --> 01:40:59,320
Thank you.

2616
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,500
Thank you, Plissken.

2617
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,180
Snake Plissken.

2618
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:09,620
Wait, what's your number again?

2619
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:14,180
4219...

2620
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:15,600
1897.

2621
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:21,400
This is where I fucked up.

2622
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:24,460
Don't say what a thrill, that's the wrong game!

2623
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,840
Oh, I see you, I see you.

2624
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:30,540
Really?

2625
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:31,200
Okay.

2626
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:33,180
Keep going straight, keep going straight.

2627
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:34,660
Alright, I'm here now.

2628
01:41:34,820 --> 01:41:35,340
Did you see me?

2629
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:39,220
I went the wrong way.

2630
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:42,540
I thought I saw the right way, but I didn't see the right way.

2631
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:43,560
Watch out for the hole.

2632
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:46,240
I'm watching out for the hole now.

2633
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:47,440
I'm eating my bread.

2634
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:49,060
Wait, so then chat...

2635
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:52,140
For people who noticed and just decided not to say anything.

2636
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:52,600
Yeah.

2637
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:55,400
How far away was it?

2638
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:57,480
This is far.

2639
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,840
At what point...

2640
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:00,540
Was it there?

2641
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:04,060
We traveled 10,000 plus.

2642
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:06,540
I'm already hungry.

2643
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:09,020
I have lots of bread.

2644
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:10,300
I left my watermelons.

2645
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,700
Oh no, my watermelons are in the bundle.

2646
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:14,460
Wait, hold on.

2647
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:17,840
How do I get the watermelons out?

2648
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:22,700
I'm trying to eat the watermelon, hold on.

2649
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:25,620
Okay.

2650
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,780
After you're done with the watermelon, I have bread.

2651
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:28,820
Which might be more...

2652
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:31,020
Someone just said no help.

2653
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:33,420
This is ridiculous.

2654
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:34,980
We've been streaming for...

2655
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:36,340
We've been through so much.

2656
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,960
At this point, don't you feel anything for us?

2657
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,620
Don't you feel like...

2658
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:42,140
Compassion at that point?

2659
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:44,280
Or any sense of...

2660
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:45,460
Human decency?

2661
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:51,000
I can't believe...

2662
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,040
Okay, what should I do?

2663
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:53,160
Should I throw one here?

2664
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:57,440
No help.

2665
01:42:57,900 --> 01:42:59,600
No help.

2666
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:01,820
No help.

2667
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,640
It's the most...

2668
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:04,540
It's the thing...

2669
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:08,620
It's the one thing I've always wanted to ban from my chat.

2670
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:10,640
It's the fucking no help.

2671
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:13,480
It makes me want to pull out my hair.

2672
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:15,940
Do you want me to become bald?

2673
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:17,680
I will become bald.

2674
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:20,120
They'll enjoy it.

2675
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,800
No, don't encourage it.

2676
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,640
They'll just enjoy it so much.

2677
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:25,760
I'm bald now.

2678
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:28,940
I never said no, don't backseat.

2679
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:32,320
I am one of the few VTubers out there...

2680
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,060
That embraces backseating.

2681
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,860
That I was not progressive.

2682
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:37,340
I don't get backseated.

2683
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:39,020
You can't say that about me.

2684
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,420
I am all about backseating.

2685
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:54,760
Backseating.

2686
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:57,520
That's some real hope core right there.

2687
01:43:58,300 --> 01:44:00,880
That's a good helper.

2688
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:02,740
Santa's little helper.

2689
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:06,600
Thank you, little helper.

2690
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:07,580
Thank you, David.

2691
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:09,220
Did you throw the eye?

2692
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:10,940
Yeah, it's the same direction.

2693
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:12,020
We just gotta keep going.

2694
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:13,840
Okay.

2695
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:16,740
Alright, here we go.

2696
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:18,640
Help.

2697
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:19,600
Help.

2698
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:20,400
Help.

2699
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,720
I'll wait for you.

2700
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:25,120
I'm right behind you.

2701
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:26,620
I do have to pee though.

2702
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:27,840
Help.

2703
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:32,040
Do you know when we should do the eye?

2704
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:35,280
Do you have blocks?

2705
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,840
Oh my god, your dogs are pushing me.

2706
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:37,860
Or you're pushing me.

2707
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:39,760
I'm behind.

2708
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:40,420
Yep, blocks.

2709
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:41,320
I didn't bring blocks.

2710
01:44:41,980 --> 01:44:42,460
What do you...

2711
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:45,740
I'll just use some dirt.

2712
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,320
Oh wait, I don't have any room.

2713
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:52,920
Okay, I'll use my 7 rock.

2714
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:53,640
Okay.

2715
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:56,040
You can just re-mine it after.

2716
01:44:57,880 --> 01:44:58,320
Sure.

2717
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:00,900
They'll fall.

2718
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:02,740
I don't care.

2719
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:05,860
Then what's the point of me re-mining it?

2720
01:45:05,860 --> 01:45:07,220
They have no names.

2721
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:11,540
No, I'm not talking about the dogs will fall.

2722
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:13,580
I'm talking about the blocks will fall.

2723
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:15,160
Get the blocks!

2724
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:16,100
Get the blocks!

2725
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,540
I can't!

2726
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:18,360
Do you have a bow?

2727
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:19,960
Yeah.

2728
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:22,040
Yes, help.

2729
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:23,560
Yes.

2730
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:24,680
Yes, help.

2731
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:26,180
Wait, I didn't mean to...

2732
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:28,900
Okay, well, get off the boat and I can get on it.

2733
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:31,200
And then you can throw the eye of Ender out there.

2734
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,960
And then the world will be a beautiful place.

2735
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:36,700
What if I just kept going?

2736
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:38,520
Alright.

2737
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:39,700
Did it stop?

2738
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:42,320
Just keep going.

2739
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,280
What if I just keep going?

2740
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:52,180
Alright, I think we can go to that area and then throw the eye, right?

2741
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:53,020
Would that be fine?

2742
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:53,840
Or should we just keep going?

2743
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,880
I don't know how many we have to do before we throw the eye in the air.

2744
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:59,320
I don't know either.

2745
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:01,280
You've done this before.

2746
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,040
You've done this so many times.

2747
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:04,860
I've done this two times.

2748
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,460
That's two more than me!

2749
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:07,380
That's...

2750
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:10,660
Give me some...

2751
01:46:10,660 --> 01:46:12,560
Give me a little bit of a credit.

2752
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,460
That's only two times.

2753
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:15,900
That's two more than me.

2754
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,140
That doesn't matter.

2755
01:46:17,740 --> 01:46:18,960
That's what I'm saying.

2756
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:22,980
Okay, are you ready to throw it up?

2757
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:24,520
In the water?

2758
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:25,900
Just throw it up.

2759
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:27,240
Go to the left.

2760
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:28,440
To our left.

2761
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:30,640
To our left.

2762
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:33,760
I'm going to the left.

2763
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:35,020
To the left.

2764
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:35,760
To the left.

2765
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:40,340
All my brain cells in a box to the left.

2766
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:41,460
To the left.

2767
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,360
To the left.

2768
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:44,220
Can I go back now, y'all?

2769
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:45,760
Yeah.

2770
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:48,980
This is not...

2771
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:50,400
My dog came over.

2772
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:51,200
I'm sorry.

2773
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,060
I'm sorry.

2774
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:52,540
I know.

2775
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,960
Why are you still here?

2776
01:46:56,380 --> 01:46:56,900
I know.

2777
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,120
Where is he?

2778
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:02,980
Underneath my...

2779
01:47:02,980 --> 01:47:04,160
Oh my gosh, no.

2780
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:05,600
Why did you do that?

2781
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:07,460
Under my desk right now.

2782
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,000
Oh, your actual dog.

2783
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:10,620
Yeah, my actual.

2784
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:13,340
Okay.

2785
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:15,900
Where does the eye of ender tell you?

2786
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:17,660
Where is your Minecraft dogs?

2787
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:18,200
Where are they?

2788
01:47:18,940 --> 01:47:20,480
I don't...it's fine.

2789
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:22,600
It's fine.

2790
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:24,060
Eye of ender.

2791
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:26,060
Tell us where you are.

2792
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:26,960
That way.

2793
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:30,080
Oh, it hasn't broken.

2794
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:30,660
Nice.

2795
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:33,380
Has this been the same one?

2796
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:33,860
Yeah.

2797
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:35,700
The entire time?

2798
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:36,800
Wait, where'd it go?

2799
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:40,260
Where'd it go?

2800
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:43,160
Why don't these things fucking flow, man?

2801
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:44,800
Where'd it go?

2802
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,020
I see it.

2803
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:46,560
It's on me.

2804
01:47:47,140 --> 01:47:47,960
I got it.

2805
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:49,060
Okay.

2806
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:51,700
It's fine.

2807
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:52,980
I got it.

2808
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:54,660
This way, right?

2809
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:57,160
Am I going the right way?

2810
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:57,940
I already forgot.

2811
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:01,300
Am I going the right way?

2812
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:01,860
Yeah, you're going the right way.

2813
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:07,060
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

2814
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:08,060
I can't.

2815
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:09,280
No, I actually don't know.

2816
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:11,260
No, I'm talking about someone in chat.

2817
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:14,340
Okay, I'm throwing the eye out to you.

2818
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:15,020
Right here.

2819
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,520
Oh, I'm still in the boat.

2820
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:20,500
Yeah, I'm breaking the boat.

2821
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:21,360
Oh, I got it.

2822
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:23,760
Up we go.

2823
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:25,000
Up we go.

2824
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:30,980
Guys, you should buy the concert tickets, guys.

2825
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,760
It's the same fun experience.

2826
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:36,220
What if we did this at the concert?

2827
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:37,860
What if we did this, guys?

2828
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:40,100
If you buy our tickets, we'll do this at the concert.

2829
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:42,400
We're just gonna watch us play Minecraft.

2830
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:45,740
You can watch us play Minecraft in 3D.

2831
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:48,520
And watch us lose our minds in 3D.

2832
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,740
Buy the tickets and watch us play.

2833
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:52,880
Watch us play in 3D.

2834
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:54,180
Where'd you go?

2835
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:56,760
If only if the concert sells out.

2836
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:57,500
Where'd you go?

2837
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:58,560
I don't know.

2838
01:48:58,680 --> 01:48:59,560
I'm over here.

2839
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:00,820
Oh, I see you.

2840
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:03,820
Only if the tickets sold out, then we'll do it.

2841
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:06,760
It'll be the longest concert ever.

2842
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:09,760
We'll get a world record.

2843
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:15,200
If the venue kicks us out, we're gonna take us to another venue.

2844
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:16,780
And we're gonna keep doing it.

2845
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:20,060
We'll just keep going and going and going.

2846
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:20,800
Everybody!

2847
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:24,600
Only if the concert sells out, though.

2848
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:25,360
We won't do it.

2849
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:27,520
Every single ticket's gotta be gone.

2850
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:33,000
Every ticket has to be gone if you want us to play Minecraft in 3D.

2851
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:35,200
For 24 hours straight.

2852
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:37,300
No, don't say that.

2853
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:38,880
Don't say that.

2854
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,240
It's not gonna be when we do the challenge.

2855
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:43,140
We're gonna do the challenge all over again.

2856
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,660
Do you really think this is gonna take us 24 hours?

2857
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:46,640
Do you really?

2858
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:47,580
Where did you go?

2859
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:48,960
Where did you go?

2860
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:51,660
Oh, I'm right here.

2861
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:53,300
Should we throw it?

2862
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:56,840
Yeah, I'll throw it at the edge of this.

2863
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:00,780
We'll hold you to that.

2864
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,520
Alright, fucking buy everything.

2865
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:06,700
Oh my god, that scared me.

2866
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:07,360
That's fine.

2867
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,760
I have lots of...

2868
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:10,240
Oh my god.

2869
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:13,440
I need to get dirt.

2870
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:15,360
I need to make sure I stop falling.

2871
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:20,780
Okay, my 7 dirts.

2872
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:22,020
Alright.

2873
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:22,780
Oh, no.

2874
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:27,560
Okay.

2875
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:29,920
Ayavender, guide us!

2876
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:30,900
Ayavender!

2877
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,880
We passed it!

2878
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:36,760
Wait, that means it's close!

2879
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:39,620
Oh my god, I'm waking up.

2880
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:43,320
We go to that land, and then we throw the eye again.

2881
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:44,560
We didn't walk that far.

2882
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:46,600
We didn't walk that far this time.

2883
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:48,340
Where'd you go?

2884
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:49,120
Okay, I see you.

2885
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:51,080
Okay, then we throw it here.

2886
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:53,780
Because I know we didn't walk that far compared to the other one.

2887
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:56,960
Oh my god, oh my god, everybody.

2888
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:58,160
Oh my god.

2889
01:50:58,380 --> 01:50:59,000
This hopium.

2890
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:01,800
This hopium is right here.

2891
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,420
Get the guests on it too.

2892
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,940
Everybody gets to play.

2893
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:05,920
Where are you?

2894
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,560
Alright, let's maybe sleep first.

2895
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:10,360
And then it'll be a morning surprise.

2896
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,180
Hopium.

2897
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:13,580
Good morning.

2898
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:15,320
Surprise.

2899
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:16,920
Good morning.

2900
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:18,780
Good morning.

2901
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:20,040
Good morning.

2902
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:23,800
Come on.

2903
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:25,200
Come on.

2904
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:27,740
Oh, thank god.

2905
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:31,940
Thank god.

2906
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:33,680
Alright, throw it.

2907
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:36,000
Throw it in the sky.

2908
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:39,240
I'm gonna get the coal real quick.

2909
01:51:42,790 --> 01:51:45,190
I'm obsessed with mining coal.

2910
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:46,550
Check.

2911
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:48,090
It says beach.

2912
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:50,530
It says beach.

2913
01:51:50,910 --> 01:51:54,150
Don't we have to be in the...

2914
01:51:54,150 --> 01:51:55,370
Don't we...

2915
01:51:55,370 --> 01:51:56,330
I don't know.

2916
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:59,290
Have to be below...

2917
01:51:59,790 --> 01:52:01,030
I don't know.

2918
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:02,830
They said we passed it by...

2919
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:04,970
We passed two strongholds because of our coordinates.

2920
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:06,950
I don't know what to believe anymore.

2921
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:09,070
Well, that's fine.

2922
01:52:09,210 --> 01:52:11,590
Of course, maybe we're gonna pass something.

2923
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:12,070
Alright.

2924
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:12,810
Throw!

2925
01:52:15,310 --> 01:52:16,290
Over there.

2926
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:18,390
Is it in the water?

2927
01:52:26,690 --> 01:52:28,950
Looking at my biome.

2928
01:52:31,470 --> 01:52:31,990
Oh.

2929
01:52:32,670 --> 01:52:33,190
Wait.

2930
01:52:33,930 --> 01:52:34,310
Oh.

2931
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:39,280
Back here?

2932
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:42,460
Try on top of the hilltop?

2933
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:43,080
Right in here?

2934
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:43,780
Like here?

2935
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,780
Hold on, I'm trying...

2936
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:48,640
Try...

2937
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,240
On the mountain.

2938
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:50,420
On the mountain?

2939
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:51,200
All the way there?

2940
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:52,420
No.

2941
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:56,500
Because over here, it brought us back this way.

2942
01:52:57,220 --> 01:52:58,760
No, because we were all the way down...

2943
01:52:58,760 --> 01:52:59,680
We walked further.

2944
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:02,900
No, I threw it right there.

2945
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:03,680
In the...

2946
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:06,680
Should we throw it one more time?

2947
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:07,820
I'm gonna try here.

2948
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:22,080
Huh?

2949
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,680
Is it right below us?

2950
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:26,440
Is it in the water?

2951
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:30,800
Okay, I'm gonna go to the other side.

2952
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:33,060
Right here on this hilltop and try now.

2953
01:53:33,700 --> 01:53:34,180
Okay.

2954
01:53:36,700 --> 01:53:38,000
Please, God, no.

2955
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,340
Please be kind to us.

2956
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:40,640
We've been through so much.

2957
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:41,820
We've been through a lot.

2958
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:44,080
Okay, throw.

2959
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:46,420
Oh, no!

2960
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:51,800
It's down there.

2961
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:54,060
Oh, no, it didn't break.

2962
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:55,480
Wow, this thing is indestructible.

2963
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:55,960
It's awesome.

2964
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:57,880
This is the worst seed.

2965
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,040
This is the worst seed ever.

2966
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:02,020
This is the worst seed ever.

2967
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:02,680
This is actually...

2968
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:05,200
This is actually the worst seed ever.

2969
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:07,200
This is actually...

2970
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:10,780
The worst seed we've ever had.

2971
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:19,620
We can probably dig a...

2972
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:20,700
Get doors.

2973
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:21,860
I'm gonna make a door.

2974
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:25,200
We can probably dig...

2975
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:26,760
Like a...

2976
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:27,420
What's it called?

2977
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:31,100
A staircase from the land.

2978
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:32,400
And it should be okay, maybe.

2979
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:32,520
Okay.

2980
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:35,460
I got a door.

2981
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:41,500
Like, what if we dig down from here and then just go over.

2982
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:42,180
I got a door.

2983
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:44,540
Here, right?

2984
01:54:44,740 --> 01:54:45,660
It was here, right?

2985
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:47,420
About, yeah, I think.

2986
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:50,000
There we go.

2987
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:51,340
I'm ready to dig down.

2988
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:52,420
Where did you go?

2989
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:53,200
Oh, okay.

2990
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:55,280
Alright, dig down.

2991
01:54:58,420 --> 01:54:59,220
I'm ready.

2992
01:54:59,380 --> 01:55:00,240
I'll wait for you.

2993
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:01,460
Where's my pickaxe?

2994
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:03,780
I gave it back to you.

2995
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:05,400
I know.

2996
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:08,040
Where did my door go?

2997
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:09,520
Okay, there we go.

2998
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:13,180
Just know the water is gonna go inside, so you gotta keep digging.

2999
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:16,620
You gotta keep digging.

3000
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:22,200
I fucked up my door.

3001
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:23,880
I fucked it up!

3002
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:25,360
What do you mean you...

3003
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:26,600
What did you do?

3004
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:28,560
I died.

3005
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:29,960
Okay.

3006
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:32,060
Alright, come down.

3007
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:33,360
Okay, I'm coming.

3008
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:36,230
Alright.

3009
01:55:46,770 --> 01:55:47,370
Alright.

3010
01:55:48,670 --> 01:55:50,670
I don't know how to do this.

3011
01:55:50,770 --> 01:55:52,330
Just do a staircase down.

3012
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:55,890
Like a spiral staircase down, I think.

3013
01:55:56,030 --> 01:55:56,730
What are we at?

3014
01:55:56,770 --> 01:55:57,070
40?

3015
01:55:58,850 --> 01:56:00,670
Alright, here we go.

3016
01:56:00,970 --> 01:56:02,550
Where's my pickaxe?

3017
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:02,630
Where's my pickaxe?

3018
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:08,700
Alright.

3019
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:12,960
Alright.

3020
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,320
Oopsie, I just...

3021
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:15,980
Oh, my bad.

3022
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:18,400
That's fine, watch this.

3023
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:19,560
There we go.

3024
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:22,220
Okay, perfect.

3025
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,400
Oh, I fucked it up too.

3026
01:56:27,380 --> 01:56:28,180
Hold on.

3027
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:30,080
You have the other door?

3028
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,060
I have the other door.

3029
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:35,980
Wait, shoot, that's not how that works.

3030
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:37,660
Oh, shoot.

3031
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:38,380
Put it down here.

3032
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:39,160
Give me the door.

3033
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:41,840
Okay, hold on, I'm getting it.

3034
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:43,940
I gotta get it with my hands.

3035
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:49,100
Oh, here, I am here.

3036
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:50,940
Alright, pass me the door.

3037
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:54,580
I gave it to you.

3038
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:55,600
Alright.

3039
01:56:57,140 --> 01:56:58,120
Wait, I hear it.

3040
01:56:58,120 --> 01:56:58,200
Wait, I hear it.

3041
01:56:58,860 --> 01:56:59,620
You hear what?

3042
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:01,620
No, that's my music.

3043
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:03,100
Here we go.

3044
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,800
I don't know how this works.

3045
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:06,980
How do we do this?

3046
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:09,940
How do we dig?

3047
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:12,660
Are we doing it correctly?

3048
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:14,940
Is this the stronghold area?

3049
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:17,040
I don't know.

3050
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:18,700
I don't know if I'm...

3051
01:57:18,700 --> 01:57:20,740
Am I heading correctly to the stronghold?

3052
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:22,240
Am I...

3053
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:25,180
I've never done the stronghold before.

3054
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:26,960
I'm just digging.

3055
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:28,220
I've never...

3056
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:30,020
I've never done stronghold before.

3057
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:31,700
Am I...

3058
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:32,460
Just dig down?

3059
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:35,520
Yeah, just do what you're doing.

3060
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:39,000
Just a little spiral staircase kind of thing.

3061
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,520
Just keep going.

3062
01:57:42,820 --> 01:57:44,380
Just keep going down, I guess.

3063
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:45,320
Yeah, just keep going.

3064
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:46,820
Keep going down.

3065
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:53,620
We'll get there eventually.

3066
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,600
What if we go past it?

3067
01:57:56,980 --> 01:57:57,760
I don't know.

3068
01:57:58,500 --> 01:57:59,360
I can't tell.

3069
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:03,760
I don't think we will.

3070
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:05,140
I need iron.

3071
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:08,200
Do we need iron?

3072
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:13,300
I'll grab some just in case.

3073
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:13,700
Okay.

3074
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:19,080
You'll know when you get to it, though.

3075
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:20,140
Did we miss it?

3076
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:21,140
What if we missed it?

3077
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:22,160
It could...

3078
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:24,100
They're usually pretty deep, right?

3079
01:58:25,580 --> 01:58:26,640
It's a cave.

3080
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:27,780
We're at a cave.

3081
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:29,420
Oh, but it's water.

3082
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:33,080
Yeah, this isn't...

3083
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:35,300
What is it?

3084
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:38,020
This is not it.

3085
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:40,480
I'm exploring a little.

3086
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:41,280
Oh, gosh.

3087
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:46,440
Making another spiral staircase?

3088
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:48,360
Come back, come back, come back.

3089
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:49,140
I'm trying to find...

3090
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:52,700
I'm trying to find you, I'm trying to find you.

3091
01:58:52,780 --> 01:58:54,800
We're gonna make the other...

3092
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:56,700
Nope, that's just water.

3093
01:58:57,220 --> 01:58:58,440
That's just water.

3094
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,760
Maybe we should go make some more doors.

3095
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:04,740
That was so close.

3096
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,300
That's still water!

3097
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:13,060
Can you set down a...

3098
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:15,540
cooking table?

3099
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:16,840
Yeah.

3100
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:17,980
I can.

3101
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:19,920
I'll make some more doors.

3102
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:26,260
Why is there more water under the water?

3103
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:27,020
Wait, where are you?

3104
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:27,740
Oh, you're over here.

3105
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:27,980
Okay.

3106
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:31,000
Why is there so much water?

3107
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:32,740
Wait, how many?

3108
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:34,960
Why is there so much?

3109
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:36,340
I don't understand.

3110
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:38,080
Why is it just water?

3111
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:41,800
Why is this the worst seat out there?

3112
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:42,520
I...

3113
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,240
I don't understand.

3114
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:50,460
Is there anything that's not just water?

3115
01:59:57,640 --> 01:59:58,240
Like...

3116
01:59:58,240 --> 01:59:59,120
It's water!

3117
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:05,640
Oh my god!

3118
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:07,560
It's a cave within water!

3119
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:09,780
Is that it?

3120
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:11,540
What did you see?

3121
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:12,980
I don't know what I just saw.

3122
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,520
You would know if you saw it.

3123
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:15,920
It's like a different block.

3124
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:18,060
There's a different block right there!

3125
02:00:19,340 --> 02:00:19,940
No...

3126
02:00:19,940 --> 02:00:21,200
That's not it.

3127
02:00:21,940 --> 02:00:23,260
That's a normal block.

3128
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:24,860
Oh my god.

3129
02:00:24,980 --> 02:00:25,860
Oh my god.

3130
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:28,360
I hear a zombie.

3131
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:30,580
Oh, shit.

3132
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:36,740
How is it more submerged in water?

3133
02:00:39,340 --> 02:00:40,020
It

3134
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:45,060
could be...

3135
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:46,760
It could be a zombie.

3136
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:47,720
Oh, hi.

3137
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:51,360
It could be a...

3138
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:59,540
It could be a zombie that's in the stronghold.

3139
02:01:03,370 --> 02:01:04,010
Maybe?

3140
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:08,030
This is the worst fortress ever.

3141
02:01:08,570 --> 02:01:09,150
Okay, hold on.

3142
02:01:09,250 --> 02:01:10,810
I'm gonna start building there.

3143
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:13,130
Okay, and then...

3144
02:01:13,130 --> 02:01:13,850
There you go.

3145
02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:17,010
I'm in the Minecraft river.

3146
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:21,090
I closed it off a little bit for you.

3147
02:01:21,090 --> 02:01:22,410
Throw a pearl?

3148
02:01:22,770 --> 02:01:24,430
Would it work if I...

3149
02:01:24,430 --> 02:01:25,530
There's more water!

3150
02:01:26,630 --> 02:01:27,770
Oh my god.

3151
02:01:28,290 --> 02:01:29,970
But there has to be an area.

3152
02:01:30,990 --> 02:01:32,090
Use an eye to redirect.

3153
02:01:32,510 --> 02:01:33,710
What was that eerie noise?

3154
02:01:34,510 --> 02:01:36,550
That's just usually when there's a cave around.

3155
02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:39,790
Okay, I'm gonna throw an eye.

3156
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:41,730
Come here, Doki.

3157
02:01:42,730 --> 02:01:44,150
I'm gonna do it right here.

3158
02:01:45,030 --> 02:01:45,750
Hold on.

3159
02:01:46,130 --> 02:01:48,130
I'm gonna do it here.

3160
02:01:48,130 --> 02:01:49,970
Okay, so we have some space.

3161
02:01:50,490 --> 02:01:50,850
Alright.

3162
02:01:52,190 --> 02:01:52,690
Eye!

3163
02:01:52,950 --> 02:01:53,390
Go!

3164
02:01:54,150 --> 02:01:55,070
What the fuck?

3165
02:01:59,580 --> 02:02:00,640
Where did it go?

3166
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:02,180
Where did it go?

3167
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:04,340
Where did your fucking eye go?

3168
02:02:04,380 --> 02:02:05,000
I don't know.

3169
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:07,740
It's the other way.

3170
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:09,520
Where did it go?

3171
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:11,000
Oh!

3172
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:12,140
It went this way!

3173
02:02:12,340 --> 02:02:13,340
It went right over here!

3174
02:02:13,540 --> 02:02:15,320
We gotta go this way instead.

3175
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:18,420
Okay, because we grabbed the crafting table.

3176
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:20,680
Oh, did you grab the crafting table?

3177
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:21,440
Yeah, I got it.

3178
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:22,720
Which way did it go?

3179
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:25,060
It went this way.

3180
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:28,660
Okay, I'm gonna mine this way then.

3181
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:32,860
Oh, where are you mining at?

3182
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:34,540
I'm mining this way.

3183
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:35,800
Oh, yeah.

3184
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:36,520
That's good.

3185
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:45,070
Okay, nice.

3186
02:02:46,070 --> 02:02:46,790
There we go.

3187
02:02:48,770 --> 02:02:50,370
Yeah, this pearl is awesome.

3188
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:52,790
Wait, is this the same?

3189
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:54,270
No, it's not.

3190
02:02:54,350 --> 02:02:54,870
It's the same pearl.

3191
02:02:55,030 --> 02:02:55,390
Yes, it is.

3192
02:02:55,490 --> 02:02:56,790
I saw it broke last time.

3193
02:02:56,950 --> 02:02:57,470
No, it didn't.

3194
02:02:57,570 --> 02:02:59,330
I've had 21 this entire time.

3195
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:00,430
Oh.

3196
02:03:00,650 --> 02:03:01,310
Do I go down?

3197
02:03:02,350 --> 02:03:03,410
Oh, are you going forward?

3198
02:03:03,850 --> 02:03:04,370
I don't know.

3199
02:03:04,450 --> 02:03:05,370
I'm just digging straight.

3200
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:07,290
Should we do another eye?

3201
02:03:08,930 --> 02:03:10,230
Yeah, we can do another one.

3202
02:03:11,550 --> 02:03:11,950
Okay.

3203
02:03:12,710 --> 02:03:13,470
Okay, hold on.

3204
02:03:13,610 --> 02:03:16,670
Because the eye went kind of upward, so...

3205
02:03:16,670 --> 02:03:17,370
Alright, here I go.

3206
02:03:19,170 --> 02:03:19,570
Down!

3207
02:03:20,710 --> 02:03:21,110
Down?

3208
02:03:22,330 --> 02:03:23,110
Where did it go?

3209
02:03:23,310 --> 02:03:23,750
I don't know.

3210
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:24,950
Where did your eye go?

3211
02:03:24,970 --> 02:03:25,850
I didn't even see your eye.

3212
02:03:26,030 --> 02:03:26,590
I don't know.

3213
02:03:27,070 --> 02:03:28,470
Did it break?

3214
02:03:31,190 --> 02:03:32,030
I don't know.

3215
02:03:32,970 --> 02:03:34,390
We should make more space.

3216
02:03:35,850 --> 02:03:36,750
It's down though.

3217
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:37,550
It's down for sure.

3218
02:03:37,870 --> 02:03:38,210
Oh, gosh.

3219
02:03:39,630 --> 02:03:41,170
Alright, I made a spiral down.

3220
02:03:41,670 --> 02:03:41,950
Okay.

3221
02:03:45,860 --> 02:03:47,160
Did you make a spiral down?

3222
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:48,760
Okay, yeah, yeah, from where that was.

3223
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:49,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3224
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:51,080
Just keep going down.

3225
02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:53,520
Don't make it too big of a spiral.

3226
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:54,560
Try to keep it tight.

3227
02:03:55,980 --> 02:03:56,480
Okay.

3228
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:59,520
But it's pretty big.

3229
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:01,500
We're in the savanna now.

3230
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:03,700
We're in the savanna.

3231
02:04:03,980 --> 02:04:04,820
We're in the savanna.

3232
02:04:05,380 --> 02:04:06,500
Now we're in water.

3233
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:09,200
There's water right here.

3234
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:09,720
Okay.

3235
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:12,520
Oh, hello.

3236
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:16,820
We have to go down.

3237
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:18,420
There's literally water.

3238
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:19,680
What do you want from me?

3239
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:20,260
It's water.

3240
02:04:20,980 --> 02:04:22,560
This stronghold sucks.

3241
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,540
This seed sucks.

3242
02:04:24,700 --> 02:04:25,480
Everything sucks.

3243
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:27,220
Everything about this...

3244
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:29,660
I knew this seed was going to be an issue.

3245
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:35,940
I knew this seed was going to be the biggest problem in the fucking world.

3246
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:38,640
I think the first one was the best seed we've had.

3247
02:04:40,740 --> 02:04:41,780
Okay, so...

3248
02:04:41,780 --> 02:04:44,000
There's a giant cave.

3249
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,740
Should we put the...

3250
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:49,180
There's a giant cave here.

3251
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:50,620
And I'm worried.

3252
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:53,280
I don't like that.

3253
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:55,500
Where's giant cave?

3254
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,360
Oh gosh.

3255
02:04:57,740 --> 02:04:58,580
Over there.

3256
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:00,300
You think it's under there?

3257
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:01,660
You think it's in there?

3258
02:05:02,860 --> 02:05:04,620
Well, you got your bucket.

3259
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:06,440
I got my boat too.

3260
02:05:06,740 --> 02:05:09,460
You wanna just get a boat and go down or get water?

3261
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:10,940
We'll die.

3262
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:12,400
We'll die.

3263
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:13,580
Get the water.

3264
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:16,480
I'm gonna throw an eye right now.

3265
02:05:16,900 --> 02:05:18,240
Can you see with the eye?

3266
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,880
We should make more room for this eye.

3267
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,420
Okay, let's make some room.

3268
02:05:31,970 --> 02:05:33,290
Is this enough room, guys?

3269
02:05:35,030 --> 02:05:36,230
We have a lot, yeah.

3270
02:05:36,330 --> 02:05:37,090
So I think it's okay.

3271
02:05:38,030 --> 02:05:38,710
Alright, here we go.

3272
02:05:39,770 --> 02:05:42,110
But it was like over here that it went down.

3273
02:05:42,330 --> 02:05:43,810
So it might just go down.

3274
02:05:44,170 --> 02:05:45,150
Like, if it goes...

3275
02:05:45,150 --> 02:05:45,730
Oh gosh.

3276
02:05:46,570 --> 02:05:47,370
Okay, here we go.

3277
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:00,880
Where did your eye go?

3278
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:01,500
It didn't break.

3279
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:03,840
I don't...

3280
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:04,080
No!

3281
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:06,500
It didn't break.

3282
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:06,920
What?

3283
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:11,080
It's down?

3284
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:12,260
It's just that way.

3285
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:14,060
Oh, they always go up.

3286
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:15,800
No, they don't.

3287
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:18,060
One before went down, did it not?

3288
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:20,360
Oh, it doesn't go down.

3289
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:23,700
The fortress is always above Y0?

3290
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:25,240
Huh?

3291
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:26,740
We are above Y0.

3292
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:31,520
We are.

3293
02:06:34,220 --> 02:06:35,480
Where did it go?

3294
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:36,660
I don't know.

3295
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:39,480
Is this where we came from?

3296
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:41,640
Are we going the right way?

3297
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:43,300
I don't know where the eye went.

3298
02:06:43,420 --> 02:06:44,900
Which direction was the eye?

3299
02:06:45,580 --> 02:06:48,300
I did it from here and it went this way.

3300
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:50,700
I'm so confused.

3301
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:52,480
Oh, it can go below.

3302
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:54,120
That person is fucking lying.

3303
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:55,100
I'm gonna remember your name.

3304
02:06:55,660 --> 02:06:57,760
I'm gonna fucking remember your name now.

3305
02:06:58,060 --> 02:06:59,420
We've been through so much.

3306
02:06:59,660 --> 02:07:00,840
What's your fucking name?

3307
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:03,220
I need a...

3308
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:04,960
I'm gonna...

3309
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:06,960
Yeah, okay.

3310
02:07:07,180 --> 02:07:10,660
That seems like a name that would lie to me.

3311
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:13,220
The thing is...

3312
02:07:13,220 --> 02:07:17,660
The problem is that I'm scared now because we can't find the eyes.

3313
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:22,400
I don't wanna...

3314
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:24,700
Yeah, I don't wanna keep using them and then wasting them.

3315
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:25,340
Yeah.

3316
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:27,600
How many do we need to open the portal?

3317
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:29,200
It's 12, I think, right?

3318
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:30,580
How many do we have now?

3319
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:31,660
19.

3320
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:37,080
I don't remember where it went.

3321
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:37,860
My thing is...

3322
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:39,060
I'm gonna make another...

3323
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:41,640
I need to make another pickaxe soon because mine's about to break.

3324
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:42,200
Uh-oh.

3325
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:45,800
Mine's good, but...

3326
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:49,160
Don't use your pickaxe for...

3327
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:51,000
Just use your fist for this.

3328
02:07:51,780 --> 02:07:52,600
It's too late.

3329
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:53,620
It's too late.

3330
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:56,080
This is the worst fucking scene.

3331
02:08:02,150 --> 02:08:02,690
Okay.

3332
02:08:03,830 --> 02:08:06,050
Alright, I'm gonna start doing a...

3333
02:08:06,050 --> 02:08:07,110
A spiral staircase.

3334
02:08:08,090 --> 02:08:08,590
From here.

3335
02:08:19,450 --> 02:08:20,710
Sorry, there's no going back.

3336
02:08:21,530 --> 02:08:22,810
Alright, alright.

3337
02:08:24,190 --> 02:08:24,730
Wait.

3338
02:08:25,510 --> 02:08:26,950
Oh, this is the giant cave?

3339
02:08:26,950 --> 02:08:27,910
Hold on, I'm looking.

3340
02:08:29,070 --> 02:08:29,510
Oh, diamond.

3341
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:34,660
Okay.

3342
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:37,520
Just ignore it for now.

3343
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:42,120
What if it is in this cave?

3344
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:46,440
Usually it's, like, not in a cave cave, right?

3345
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,260
What if it is?

3346
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:53,660
What if everything we know...

3347
02:08:54,260 --> 02:08:55,060
is wrong?

3348
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:59,360
They said throw it in the cave because there's a big space.

3349
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:03,720
I don't like that idea.

3350
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:06,600
I don't know what else to do.

3351
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:09,200
I think it's more over this way, though.

3352
02:09:13,590 --> 02:09:15,670
We're at Y level negative three.

3353
02:09:16,230 --> 02:09:17,290
Yeah, but they said...

3354
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:18,350
There's water.

3355
02:09:19,930 --> 02:09:20,550
Oh my god.

3356
02:09:20,950 --> 02:09:22,010
That scared me.

3357
02:09:22,290 --> 02:09:23,730
I got pushed out.

3358
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:25,150
Oh god.

3359
02:09:27,370 --> 02:09:27,950
Get the door.

3360
02:09:28,090 --> 02:09:29,050
Oh, there's...

3361
02:09:29,050 --> 02:09:30,390
Oh, that's not a drown, nevermind.

3362
02:09:30,950 --> 02:09:31,250
Oh my god.

3363
02:09:33,230 --> 02:09:33,810
Get your...

3364
02:09:33,810 --> 02:09:37,370
I don't have the doors, so...

3365
02:09:37,370 --> 02:09:37,970
You don't have doors?

3366
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:40,110
I'll go to you, I'll go to you.

3367
02:09:40,930 --> 02:09:43,930
Oh, sorry.

3368
02:09:45,210 --> 02:09:46,070
Yeah, it's fine.

3369
02:09:47,290 --> 02:09:48,170
Okay, so...

3370
02:09:48,170 --> 02:09:50,770
Here, I have some doors, so take them.

3371
02:09:51,450 --> 02:09:52,610
I don't have space.

3372
02:09:53,270 --> 02:09:55,170
Oh, throw away some cobblestone or something.

3373
02:09:58,530 --> 02:09:59,750
Oh, here comes a drown.

3374
02:10:00,030 --> 02:10:00,870
Oh, shit!

3375
02:10:01,290 --> 02:10:02,090
No, no, no!

3376
02:10:04,270 --> 02:10:06,450
I'm back in the area.

3377
02:10:06,650 --> 02:10:07,930
Oh my god, I can't come back.

3378
02:10:08,030 --> 02:10:08,850
Where is it?

3379
02:10:09,930 --> 02:10:10,730
Where is here?

3380
02:10:11,890 --> 02:10:13,050
I can't get to you.

3381
02:10:14,410 --> 02:10:15,550
I don't know where!

3382
02:10:16,970 --> 02:10:17,270
I'm here!

3383
02:10:18,890 --> 02:10:19,510
Look at me!

3384
02:10:19,510 --> 02:10:20,730
Hold on, hold on!

3385
02:10:20,830 --> 02:10:21,910
Where is my shield?

3386
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:25,250
I don't know where you are!

3387
02:10:25,610 --> 02:10:27,770
I'm literally in front of the door.

3388
02:10:27,830 --> 02:10:28,630
I'm in front of the door.

3389
02:10:28,810 --> 02:10:29,230
Did you eat?

3390
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:33,210
I can't see anything.

3391
02:10:33,290 --> 02:10:33,910
I'm in front of the door.

3392
02:10:35,570 --> 02:10:37,630
Oh god, I can't see anything.

3393
02:10:38,850 --> 02:10:40,170
Oh my god, this is so bad.

3394
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:41,230
This is it!

3395
02:10:41,590 --> 02:10:42,850
No, no, no!

3396
02:10:43,830 --> 02:10:44,630
Get over here!

3397
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:52,650
Where is down?

3398
02:10:52,650 --> 02:10:52,730
Where is down?

3399
02:10:54,490 --> 02:10:55,570
I see you!

3400
02:10:56,330 --> 02:10:57,610
Follow me!

3401
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:19,360
Why did you open the door?

3402
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:21,520
I didn't open the door!

3403
02:11:24,860 --> 02:11:29,140
I was trying to get my shield up.

3404
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:31,180
And then...

3405
02:11:31,180 --> 02:11:33,480
I couldn't see anything.

3406
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:35,520
I couldn't see...

3407
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:37,400
I literally could not see anything.

3408
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:40,700
Where did you die?

3409
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:43,400
I just want to know where the stronghold is.

3410
02:11:43,580 --> 02:11:44,680
Okay, here, I'll spectate.

3411
02:11:45,820 --> 02:11:46,460
No!

3412
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:48,360
I can't spectate!

3413
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:49,580
You can!

3414
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:53,340
I can, but I'm back at our spawn point.

3415
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:56,020
Wait, can I teleport to you?

3416
02:11:56,840 --> 02:11:57,800
Where's your eye?

3417
02:11:59,320 --> 02:11:59,960
TP...

3418
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:01,460
I just want to know where this is.

3419
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:04,020
I just want to know where this is.

3420
02:12:04,420 --> 02:12:05,760
Oh my god!

3421
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:06,940
I can't believe!

3422
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:10,160
I can't believe!

3423
02:12:10,620 --> 02:12:11,060
Everything!

3424
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:14,300
I'm trying to find your eyes!

3425
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:14,920
Press 1?

3426
02:12:15,940 --> 02:12:17,340
Oh, wait, so I have to...

3427
02:12:17,340 --> 02:12:18,220
How do I do that?

3428
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:19,180
Wait, what's 1 do?

3429
02:12:20,380 --> 02:12:21,740
Oh, teleport to player.

3430
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:22,360
Oh, okay.

3431
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:24,860
Okay, I'm by you.

3432
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:26,280
Okay, hold on.

3433
02:12:26,460 --> 02:12:28,860
I can't see anything, man.

3434
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:31,200
Okay, hold on.

3435
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,740
I'm looking for the stronghold.

3436
02:12:33,660 --> 02:12:36,100
I'm looking for the... I'm in the giant cave!

3437
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:38,200
I'm looking for the stronghold!

3438
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:38,720
Stronghold!

3439
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:42,240
I just want to know where the stronghold is.

3440
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:44,440
That's all I want.

3441
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:46,280
That's actually all I want.

3442
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:47,080
Where are you?

3443
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:47,780
Hold on.

3444
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:48,840
I see it!

3445
02:12:49,660 --> 02:12:50,580
I just...

3446
02:12:50,580 --> 02:12:53,560
I just want to know where it is.

3447
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:55,440
I don't want much.

3448
02:12:55,580 --> 02:12:56,860
I just want to know.

3449
02:12:57,500 --> 02:13:00,220
I can't freaking throw away the bed.

3450
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:01,020
I don't need it.

3451
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:04,480
Where is your eyes?

3452
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:06,720
Um...

3453
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:08,540
We were so close to it.

3454
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:12,840
We were...

3455
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:14,300
Like...

3456
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:14,780
Hold on.

3457
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:15,920
Is this a...

3458
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:17,500
Wait, hold on.

3459
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:22,480
No, this wouldn't have made it, but...

3460
02:13:24,620 --> 02:13:25,780
Right over...

3461
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:30,280
A little...

3462
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:32,640
Oh my god!

3463
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:33,700
Are you kidding me?

3464
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:35,620
Oh my god.

3465
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:37,100
I don't know if we would have survived.

3466
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:37,860
Honestly though.

3467
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:42,920
Because right inside the stronghold is the trials.

3468
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:43,820
What?

3469
02:13:44,180 --> 02:13:47,520
We would have died from these things in here.

3470
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:50,640
This is an absolute...

3471
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:53,480
No, this is a cursed seed.

3472
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:57,020
This seed is absolutely cursed.

3473
02:13:57,420 --> 02:13:57,720
No.

3474
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:58,700
No, no, no, no.

3475
02:13:59,340 --> 02:13:59,840
No.

3476
02:14:00,860 --> 02:14:01,360
Really?

3477
02:14:02,420 --> 02:14:03,980
It was next to...

3478
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:06,040
Am I close?

3479
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:07,060
Where are you?

3480
02:14:08,240 --> 02:14:08,920
Where is it?

3481
02:14:09,420 --> 02:14:10,160
Hold on.

3482
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:11,240
Let me teleport to you again.

3483
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:12,800
Where is it?

3484
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:16,560
We had trials.

3485
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,480
We had trials.

3486
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:23,000
We would have had to go through trials to just get to...

3487
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,440
That would have been funny though if we actually had to do that.

3488
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:26,320
This was the trial.

3489
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:29,560
How many trials did this...

3490
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:31,580
What did we have to go through?

3491
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:33,500
That would have been funny though.

3492
02:14:33,580 --> 02:14:38,360
That would have been really funny if that was how we died instead of the fucking underground.

3493
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:42,420
No, instead I died to a fucking drown because I just can't.

3494
02:14:42,660 --> 02:14:45,380
I hate the dumbest fucking enemy in the game.

3495
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:46,760
I hate this.

3496
02:14:48,460 --> 02:14:49,760
Tell me where it is.

3497
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:51,520
I want to see a stronghold.

3498
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:52,700
Okay.

3499
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:54,500
Okay, you're kind of far actually.

3500
02:14:54,860 --> 02:14:55,500
So you have to...

3501
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,400
It's like you're close but far.

3502
02:14:58,680 --> 02:15:00,660
It's a bit of a trek to get there.

3503
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:01,280
Okay, how?

3504
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:02,060
Which way?

3505
02:15:02,580 --> 02:15:03,500
Okay, hold on.

3506
02:15:04,140 --> 02:15:04,800
Where are you?

3507
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:05,460
Let me see.

3508
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:09,480
I have to find you again.

3509
02:15:09,580 --> 02:15:10,000
Hold on.

3510
02:15:11,860 --> 02:15:13,240
How was there...

3511
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:20,620
How could a trial be next to the merge with my stronghold?

3512
02:15:20,620 --> 02:15:22,160
I don't know.

3513
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:23,840
Okay, hold on.

3514
02:15:23,900 --> 02:15:24,780
I'm trying to figure out...

3515
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:26,620
I'm doing... I'm gonna...

3516
02:15:26,620 --> 02:15:28,280
I'm gonna do spectate.

3517
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:29,940
I'm not... I'm gonna...

3518
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:30,700
Are you gonna die?

3519
02:15:31,180 --> 02:15:32,560
No, I'm not.

3520
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:36,420
I was like, how are you gonna spectate?

3521
02:15:36,740 --> 02:15:38,520
Where did that drown come from?

3522
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:43,400
He came out of nowhere and then we haven't had a drown with a pickaxe or whatever.

3523
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:45,180
A trident the entire time.

3524
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:46,300
And then...

3525
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:48,760
Then it happened.

3526
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:50,400
And then it just happened.

3527
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:51,520
What...

3528
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:54,720
How am I supposed to do...

3529
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:56,020
And I couldn't... I already...

3530
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:58,380
The foreshadowing...

3531
02:15:58,380 --> 02:15:59,840
What was it, guys?

3532
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:01,340
How do I...

3533
02:16:02,020 --> 02:16:04,760
Slash game mode...

3534
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:07,360
Spectator?

3535
02:16:09,380 --> 02:16:10,520
Oh my god.

3536
02:16:10,680 --> 02:16:13,140
I need... I'm giving myself admin.

3537
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:14,000
Give me a sec.

3538
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:16,020
How do I...

3539
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:18,340
How do I admin myself?

3540
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:20,780
How do I mod myself?

3541
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:23,500
Guys, how do I mod myself right now?

3542
02:16:23,620 --> 02:16:24,100
I'm gonna...

3543
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:27,160
I'm gonna mod myself.

3544
02:16:27,580 --> 02:16:29,920
Slash op...

3545
02:16:31,620 --> 02:16:32,300
Unknown.

3546
02:16:32,480 --> 02:16:35,560
I'm gonna mod myself in the command.

3547
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:37,220
How do I do it?

3548
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:39,900
I can't.

3549
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:41,540
It says unknown or incomplete.

3550
02:16:45,330 --> 02:16:46,310
Okay, maybe...

3551
02:16:46,310 --> 02:16:53,850
Okay, so basically the way where you're facing from... Like, facing towards the door, you would have to go through the water.

3552
02:16:54,610 --> 02:16:57,230
Oh my gosh, this is absolutely cursed.

3553
02:16:57,670 --> 02:17:06,550
You would have to dig through the water at the very end, get past a bunch of creepers and zombies, and then dig down...

3554
02:17:06,550 --> 02:17:09,630
Where the fuck is this Stockholm?

3555
02:17:09,630 --> 02:17:10,290
Where are you?

3556
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:12,350
Where is it?

3557
02:17:13,190 --> 02:17:14,450
Are you in...

3558
02:17:15,450 --> 02:17:17,010
Yes, where is it?

3559
02:17:17,190 --> 02:17:18,150
Okay, come here.

3560
02:17:18,890 --> 02:17:21,290
So you would have to go through here...

3561
02:17:21,290 --> 02:17:25,410
You would have to go through here and then go down... Look at this.

3562
02:17:25,670 --> 02:17:26,590
This is...

3563
02:17:27,350 --> 02:17:31,990
This is the Stockholm, but then over here...

3564
02:17:31,990 --> 02:17:32,990
If we... Oh my god.

3565
02:17:33,050 --> 02:17:35,330
If we had gone any... Oh my god.

3566
02:17:35,390 --> 02:17:36,890
The trials are huge.

3567
02:17:37,510 --> 02:17:40,230
Is that the trial right there?

3568
02:17:40,690 --> 02:17:40,710
Yes!

3569
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:41,050
Yes!

3570
02:17:41,170 --> 02:17:42,910
Is the copper ship the trial?

3571
02:17:42,910 --> 02:17:43,330
Yes!

3572
02:17:44,650 --> 02:17:46,250
Oh my god!

3573
02:17:46,550 --> 02:17:49,210
What kind of hellhole scene is this?

3574
02:17:49,550 --> 02:17:50,110
Oh my god!

3575
02:17:50,490 --> 02:17:51,470
Oh my god!

3576
02:17:53,030 --> 02:17:53,850
Oh my god!

3577
02:17:54,150 --> 02:17:54,890
Oh my god!

3578
02:17:57,090 --> 02:17:59,730
The portal has no eyes in it?

3579
02:18:00,270 --> 02:18:02,210
Would we even be able to fill it up?

3580
02:18:02,710 --> 02:18:03,630
Oh my god!

3581
02:18:04,370 --> 02:18:05,250
Where's the...

3582
02:18:05,250 --> 02:18:05,990
Where's the portal?

3583
02:18:08,230 --> 02:18:09,310
Look at this!

3584
02:18:09,490 --> 02:18:10,050
Look at this!

3585
02:18:10,090 --> 02:18:13,990
We'd just be exploring and then fucking run into the trials!

3586
02:18:14,890 --> 02:18:16,170
There's this insanity!

3587
02:18:18,070 --> 02:18:19,570
And then there's...

3588
02:18:19,570 --> 02:18:20,790
There's a spawner!

3589
02:18:21,530 --> 02:18:22,930
Oh my god!

3590
02:18:28,910 --> 02:18:31,410
Okay, we had enough.

3591
02:18:31,410 --> 02:18:33,010
Oh wow!

3592
02:18:33,670 --> 02:18:35,670
This is the worst scene ever!

3593
02:18:35,770 --> 02:18:37,810
There's another spawner right here!

3594
02:18:38,310 --> 02:18:40,070
This is the worst scene ever!

3595
02:18:41,810 --> 02:18:43,130
This... We...

3596
02:18:43,130 --> 02:18:49,070
We fought against this scene every second!

3597
02:18:49,670 --> 02:18:51,390
We fought!

3598
02:18:52,190 --> 02:18:52,630
Fought!

3599
02:18:53,670 --> 02:18:55,890
It's rigged from the start!

3600
02:18:56,170 --> 02:18:57,950
It's rigged from the start!

3601
02:19:03,570 --> 02:19:05,930
Oh my god!

3602
02:19:13,170 --> 02:19:14,730
Oh my god!

3603
02:19:14,850 --> 02:19:15,030
Look!

3604
02:19:17,050 --> 02:19:17,890
Look at this!

3605
02:19:18,050 --> 02:19:18,750
The trials!

3606
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:23,910
Literally we walk up this door and we'd be in the trials and I'm so absolutely cursed!

3607
02:19:23,910 --> 02:19:25,690
Have the seed!

3608
02:19:25,850 --> 02:19:26,670
Where are you?

3609
02:19:27,430 --> 02:19:34,610
We would just be exploring and we would come upon the trials and then these guys would be released and we would just be dead!

3610
02:19:34,970 --> 02:19:37,130
We would just be doing the trials!

3611
02:19:37,710 --> 02:19:41,510
And actually we wouldn't even make it to the fucking...

3612
02:19:41,510 --> 02:19:42,950
We wouldn't even make it!

3613
02:19:42,990 --> 02:19:48,590
With our luck we would not have made it to the fucking... We had to dig underwater!

3614
02:19:48,590 --> 02:19:51,470
We had to dig underwater!

3615
02:19:52,390 --> 02:19:54,310
And they made the trials harder too!

3616
02:19:54,450 --> 02:19:54,830
And hardcore!

3617
02:19:56,130 --> 02:19:58,070
It was... Oh my god!

3618
02:19:58,170 --> 02:19:58,350
No!

3619
02:19:58,490 --> 02:20:00,190
If we dig... Oh my god!

3620
02:20:00,270 --> 02:20:05,790
If we had to dig... We just had to dig in the mountain but it showed us not the mountain!

3621
02:20:05,810 --> 02:20:07,370
It showed us not the mountain!

3622
02:20:08,170 --> 02:20:09,870
If we dig... Oh my god!

3623
02:20:09,930 --> 02:20:12,650
If we dig from the underwater that we did, we would have been in the trials.

3624
02:20:13,050 --> 02:20:13,910
If we went...

3625
02:20:13,910 --> 02:20:15,490
If we followed the water...

3626
02:20:15,490 --> 02:20:17,950
If we dug in the water...

3627
02:20:17,950 --> 02:20:22,510
It would have been... We would have done to the... We would have dropped into the trial room.

3628
02:20:22,690 --> 02:20:23,530
We would have actually...

3629
02:20:24,170 --> 02:20:24,670
Oh my god!

3630
02:20:24,710 --> 02:20:25,250
You're right!

3631
02:20:25,610 --> 02:20:26,790
From down below!

3632
02:20:26,950 --> 02:20:27,810
From the water!

3633
02:20:28,110 --> 02:20:29,730
Dropped in the trial room!

3634
02:20:30,170 --> 02:20:31,990
It's literally the water area!

3635
02:20:32,410 --> 02:20:34,810
It's literally the water area!

3636
02:20:35,490 --> 02:20:35,670
It's literally the water area!

3637
02:20:35,670 --> 02:20:36,850
Oh my god!

3638
02:20:36,910 --> 02:20:40,490
If we dug underwater and it told us to dig underwater...

3639
02:20:40,490 --> 02:20:42,650
We would have landed in the trials!

3640
02:20:42,650 --> 02:20:43,890
It was the...

3641
02:20:43,890 --> 02:20:46,270
It was the worst part!

3642
02:20:46,390 --> 02:20:47,370
We would have landed in the trials!

3643
02:20:47,370 --> 02:20:52,590
You should go back into normal in the trials and see what happens.

3644
02:20:52,730 --> 02:20:54,430
See what the trials are like.

3645
02:20:54,890 --> 02:20:55,950
Alright, I'm gonna go in.

3646
02:20:55,950 --> 02:20:58,090
Because it's these little... What is this?

3647
02:20:58,450 --> 02:21:00,470
How do I get into the crate?

3648
02:21:00,910 --> 02:21:01,630
Oh, what is this?

3649
02:21:02,610 --> 02:21:03,850
Wait, where are you?

3650
02:21:06,410 --> 02:21:07,710
It was right...

3651
02:21:07,710 --> 02:21:09,890
This is the seed.

3652
02:21:09,890 --> 02:21:10,890
Okay, I meant...

3653
02:21:11,750 --> 02:21:14,550
Here's the seed, by the way, so you can post it in your own.

3654
02:21:14,770 --> 02:21:15,770
This woke me up.

3655
02:21:15,890 --> 02:21:17,270
This actually woke me up.

3656
02:21:17,290 --> 02:21:20,230
There's a poison skelly spawner?

3657
02:21:20,770 --> 02:21:22,050
Okay, wait, where are you?

3658
02:21:22,130 --> 02:21:22,430
Where are you?

3659
02:21:22,630 --> 02:21:23,690
I'm next to you.

3660
02:21:23,870 --> 02:21:25,390
Okay, I'm gonna put in...

3661
02:21:25,390 --> 02:21:27,490
I'm gonna put in survival.

3662
02:21:27,490 --> 02:21:28,530
Okay, good luck.

3663
02:21:31,350 --> 02:21:32,830
Here I am.

3664
02:21:33,070 --> 02:21:34,170
How does it work?

3665
02:21:34,430 --> 02:21:35,270
Here comes Ace.

3666
02:21:35,450 --> 02:21:35,950
Oh my god.

3667
02:21:36,410 --> 02:21:38,710
There's like poison skellies here.

3668
02:21:40,230 --> 02:21:42,270
How do I start the trials?

3669
02:21:42,630 --> 02:21:45,570
I think you just exist in here and the trials start.

3670
02:21:45,710 --> 02:21:46,430
Oh, here's the things.

3671
02:21:46,570 --> 02:21:47,730
Oh, there you go.

3672
02:21:49,110 --> 02:21:50,610
Here's the breeze.

3673
02:21:52,470 --> 02:21:55,650
This is what we had to go through if we lived this long.

3674
02:21:56,430 --> 02:21:57,970
If we lived this long.

3675
02:22:01,510 --> 02:22:03,090
It's coming for me.

3676
02:22:03,390 --> 02:22:05,870
Oh my god, the poison skellies.

3677
02:22:05,870 --> 02:22:07,390
This is absolutely cursed.

3678
02:22:07,510 --> 02:22:08,970
This is absolutely cursed.

3679
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:10,910
Oh my god.

3680
02:22:11,650 --> 02:22:13,290
This is what I had to go through.

3681
02:22:16,190 --> 02:22:17,710
Oh my god.

3682
02:22:22,270 --> 02:22:23,610
She's doing it, chat.

3683
02:22:23,850 --> 02:22:24,970
She's doing it.

3684
02:22:25,630 --> 02:22:28,850
Oh my god, my entire chat is just sound effects.

3685
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:30,110
I know, I see.

3686
02:22:30,110 --> 02:22:32,430
It's just...

3687
02:22:33,930 --> 02:22:35,110
Oh my god.

3688
02:22:35,350 --> 02:22:37,910
That's a spawner so they just don't stop.

3689
02:22:38,010 --> 02:22:39,050
They just don't stop.

3690
02:22:39,690 --> 02:22:41,670
I can't even destroy this.

3691
02:22:47,250 --> 02:22:49,010
Get out of here.

3692
02:22:51,210 --> 02:22:52,290
Oh my god.

3693
02:22:53,950 --> 02:22:55,170
How are you alive?

3694
02:22:55,950 --> 02:22:58,130
I'm not okay.

3695
02:22:58,130 --> 02:22:59,150
Oh my god.

3696
02:23:08,170 --> 02:23:10,010
He's coming inside.

3697
02:23:10,150 --> 02:23:11,730
Oh my god, he just destroyed the doors.

3698
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:16,890
You're in the struggle.

3699
02:23:21,310 --> 02:23:23,270
It's the only way to get out.

3700
02:23:24,090 --> 02:23:26,030
They can open doors.

3701
02:23:26,030 --> 02:23:27,570
I know, I know.

3702
02:23:30,110 --> 02:23:30,970
Oh my god.

3703
02:23:31,110 --> 02:23:32,630
Oh, you killed him, nice.

3704
02:23:33,370 --> 02:23:36,030
Oh my god, you're full of arrows.

3705
02:23:37,030 --> 02:23:38,930
I made it to the stronghold.

3706
02:23:39,150 --> 02:23:40,210
Let's go.

3707
02:23:43,950 --> 02:23:46,170
Here's the coordinates, guys.

3708
02:23:46,370 --> 02:23:47,150
Here it is.

3709
02:23:47,670 --> 02:23:48,510
Oh my god.

3710
02:23:49,830 --> 02:23:53,650
I'm glad we ended up committing to see this bullshit.

3711
02:23:56,030 --> 02:23:57,130
I can go again.

3712
02:23:57,390 --> 02:23:59,510
It opens right up into it.

3713
02:23:59,590 --> 02:24:02,030
It opens right...

3714
02:24:02,890 --> 02:24:06,370
Oh my god.

3715
02:24:07,170 --> 02:24:09,430
This is the worst ever.

3716
02:24:09,850 --> 02:24:11,190
This is the worst ever.

3717
02:24:14,690 --> 02:24:15,790
There's no way.

3718
02:24:15,950 --> 02:24:21,690
I think if we had lived here, I just would have turned around and been like, go straight to the eye.

3719
02:24:21,910 --> 02:24:22,650
Do not...

3720
02:24:22,650 --> 02:24:24,950
Don't look at anything else.

3721
02:24:24,950 --> 02:24:26,250
Don't even...

3722
02:24:26,250 --> 02:24:28,430
We can't even find the eye.

3723
02:24:28,770 --> 02:24:31,230
We don't even know where the eye was.

3724
02:24:38,750 --> 02:24:40,850
There's some spawners up here.

3725
02:24:41,130 --> 02:24:42,330
Oh yeah, what's in the chest?

3726
02:24:44,530 --> 02:24:45,710
Wooden axes.

3727
02:24:46,530 --> 02:24:47,310
This sucks.

3728
02:24:47,490 --> 02:24:47,870
Oh my god.

3729
02:24:48,010 --> 02:24:51,090
This is the worst addition ever to Minecraft.

3730
02:24:51,210 --> 02:24:51,770
Can I break this?

3731
02:24:51,770 --> 02:24:54,450
I can break the trial rule.

3732
02:24:54,870 --> 02:24:56,830
I can be like, I'm fucking out.

3733
02:24:58,570 --> 02:25:00,390
Oh, there's like beds and stuff.

3734
02:25:00,510 --> 02:25:01,830
There's like hidden beds.

3735
02:25:02,270 --> 02:25:03,690
What the hell are these?

3736
02:25:04,270 --> 02:25:05,190
Oh, weird.

3737
02:25:06,330 --> 02:25:08,370
They're not supposed to merge, right?

3738
02:25:08,650 --> 02:25:09,930
I don't think so.

3739
02:25:09,970 --> 02:25:11,130
I've never seen this before.

3740
02:25:11,770 --> 02:25:13,430
They're not supposed to merge, right?

3741
02:25:13,430 --> 02:25:14,790
I've never seen this before.

3742
02:25:15,570 --> 02:25:17,310
Are they supposed to merge?

3743
02:25:17,850 --> 02:25:19,910
Are they supposed to merge?

3744
02:25:19,910 --> 02:25:22,550
Like, is this supposed to happen?

3745
02:25:23,410 --> 02:25:27,690
No, someone said it's not supposed to.

3746
02:25:28,150 --> 02:25:31,810
Someone literally said it's not supposed to.

3747
02:25:33,670 --> 02:25:34,950
Oh my god.

3748
02:25:35,190 --> 02:25:38,550
I'm filing a complaint with Minecraft right now.

3749
02:25:38,730 --> 02:25:39,170
Oh my god.

3750
02:25:39,930 --> 02:25:41,390
Oh my god.

3751
02:25:41,810 --> 02:25:42,190
Why?

3752
02:25:43,130 --> 02:25:44,630
Why is there a seed?

3753
02:25:44,630 --> 02:25:44,850
Why?

3754
02:25:46,810 --> 02:25:48,270
What was the seed?

3755
02:25:49,210 --> 02:25:51,930
I posted it in our chat.

3756
02:25:52,130 --> 02:25:52,990
You can post it.

3757
02:25:53,530 --> 02:25:57,310
This is the seed for anybody who wants to explore.

3758
02:25:57,570 --> 02:25:58,230
Have fun.

3759
02:25:58,710 --> 02:26:00,510
Have fun in this hellhole.

3760
02:26:00,710 --> 02:26:01,470
I'm gonna...

3761
02:26:02,370 --> 02:26:03,070
Enjoy.

3762
02:26:03,950 --> 02:26:05,050
Have fun.

3763
02:26:05,190 --> 02:26:06,650
I'm just...

3764
02:26:06,650 --> 02:26:08,330
I'm gonna delete this world.

3765
02:26:09,450 --> 02:26:11,370
I'm deleting this world.

3766
02:26:12,110 --> 02:26:14,230
I'm deleting this world.

3767
02:26:14,230 --> 02:26:16,170
Oh, this is the outside of the trials.

3768
02:26:16,310 --> 02:26:16,770
Oh my god.

3769
02:26:16,790 --> 02:26:18,290
This is the newest version.

3770
02:26:18,490 --> 02:26:21,350
This is the newest version.

3771
02:26:22,270 --> 02:26:24,330
And the trials are huge.

3772
02:26:24,470 --> 02:26:25,670
Like, it's humongous.

3773
02:26:25,770 --> 02:26:26,850
It never ends.

3774
02:26:27,710 --> 02:26:29,270
I'm gonna sleep through the night.

3775
02:26:29,710 --> 02:26:30,270
Good night.

3776
02:26:36,270 --> 02:26:37,510
Where did you go?

3777
02:26:38,030 --> 02:26:38,690
I don't know.

3778
02:26:38,790 --> 02:26:40,030
I'm going back to spectate.

3779
02:26:40,130 --> 02:26:42,350
I need to know where I...

3780
02:26:42,350 --> 02:26:43,610
Where I went to.

3781
02:26:44,010 --> 02:26:45,750
Oh my god.

3782
02:26:46,430 --> 02:26:48,130
Just a bunch of potatoes.

3783
02:26:48,430 --> 02:26:50,090
Why is the loot in here so terrible?

3784
02:26:50,290 --> 02:26:51,030
Oh my god.

3785
02:26:51,050 --> 02:26:53,470
What was the point of being in the trials?

3786
02:26:54,050 --> 02:26:55,290
What was the point?

3787
02:26:55,450 --> 02:26:59,430
What was the point of being in the trials?

3788
02:26:59,770 --> 02:27:00,870
Where is the ender?

3789
02:27:01,290 --> 02:27:03,290
I don't even know.

3790
02:27:03,390 --> 02:27:06,390
I'm going to the ender dragon.

3791
02:27:06,890 --> 02:27:07,830
I'm fucking...

3792
02:27:07,830 --> 02:27:09,550
How are you going to the ender dragon?

3793
02:27:09,550 --> 02:27:11,990
I'm going to the ender dragon.

3794
02:27:12,210 --> 02:27:12,650
I...

3795
02:27:12,650 --> 02:27:14,710
How do I go to the end?

3796
02:27:15,090 --> 02:27:15,730
How do I...

3797
02:27:16,410 --> 02:27:17,870
How do I teleport to you?

3798
02:27:19,790 --> 02:27:24,470
You have to probably go to the eye and then put in the things and then go to the dragon.

3799
02:27:25,150 --> 02:27:26,090
I'm going in.

3800
02:27:28,310 --> 02:27:30,290
Get this shit out of here.

3801
02:27:30,490 --> 02:27:33,030
Get this shit out.

3802
02:27:33,410 --> 02:27:34,330
You got all my stuff?

3803
02:27:36,470 --> 02:27:36,950
No.

3804
02:27:36,950 --> 02:27:38,750
I'm fucking in creative mode.

3805
02:27:38,850 --> 02:27:39,570
I'm in creative.

3806
02:27:39,590 --> 02:27:41,170
Can you change my mode?

3807
02:27:41,650 --> 02:27:42,450
Since you're admin.

3808
02:27:43,690 --> 02:27:44,250
I can.

3809
02:27:44,930 --> 02:27:46,330
Game mode.

3810
02:27:46,790 --> 02:27:47,410
Creative.

3811
02:27:49,110 --> 02:27:50,250
There we go.

3812
02:27:50,770 --> 02:27:51,330
Yeah!

3813
02:27:51,910 --> 02:27:52,270
I'm back!

3814
02:27:53,150 --> 02:27:54,670
I'm back, baby!

3815
02:27:55,510 --> 02:27:56,590
Get the eye.

3816
02:27:56,650 --> 02:27:58,210
Get the eye and put it in.

3817
02:27:58,570 --> 02:28:00,450
Get the eye and put it in.

3818
02:28:01,170 --> 02:28:02,430
We suffered enough.

3819
02:28:03,250 --> 02:28:04,370
We suffered enough.

3820
02:28:04,370 --> 02:28:06,330
We suffered enough.

3821
02:28:08,080 --> 02:28:09,870
This is so fucked up.

3822
02:28:20,310 --> 02:28:21,790
Oh wait.

3823
02:28:21,910 --> 02:28:23,390
We're in the worst spot.

3824
02:28:23,570 --> 02:28:24,450
This is so...

3825
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:40,720
Come on.

3826
02:28:40,780 --> 02:28:42,840
Let's go beat this fucker.

3827
02:28:43,060 --> 02:28:43,840
Come on.

3828
02:28:44,260 --> 02:28:45,620
Netherite sword.

3829
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:46,420
Hold on.

3830
02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:53,760
We're doing it.

3831
02:28:54,060 --> 02:28:55,420
We're doing it.

3832
02:28:56,620 --> 02:28:57,200
No!

3833
02:28:57,420 --> 02:28:58,800
You don't get to have that.

3834
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:01,100
You don't get to have that either.

3835
02:29:01,580 --> 02:29:02,280
Or this one.

3836
02:29:03,480 --> 02:29:04,580
Or this one.

3837
02:29:04,580 --> 02:29:05,940
What the fuck is this?

3838
02:29:06,180 --> 02:29:06,900
Kill him!

3839
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:07,780
Kill him!

3840
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:08,980
Kill him!

3841
02:29:09,180 --> 02:29:09,740
Kill him!

3842
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:11,160
Oh wait, there's one more.

3843
02:29:13,540 --> 02:29:14,820
Kill him!

3844
02:29:15,380 --> 02:29:15,720
Why?

3845
02:29:17,300 --> 02:29:17,940
Why?

3846
02:29:21,440 --> 02:29:24,080
What was the point of everything we did?

3847
02:29:24,460 --> 02:29:25,600
What was the point?

3848
02:29:26,040 --> 02:29:27,160
What was the point?

3849
02:29:27,540 --> 02:29:28,920
What was the point?

3850
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:31,340
When you put us down!

3851
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:35,040
What was the point?

3852
02:29:35,680 --> 02:29:37,340
Oh he's about to do his thing.

3853
02:29:40,900 --> 02:29:43,320
Do your fucking thing now.

3854
02:29:44,620 --> 02:29:45,460
Do it.

3855
02:29:47,100 --> 02:29:48,860
Oh you're charging.

3856
02:29:49,780 --> 02:29:55,440
This is so cathartic right now.

3857
02:30:04,940 --> 02:30:05,540
Die!

3858
02:30:07,720 --> 02:30:08,400
You gotta die!

3859
02:30:08,500 --> 02:30:09,540
Ender Dragon, die!

3860
02:30:13,300 --> 02:30:16,060
Everything, screw you, screw this whole world.

3861
02:30:16,260 --> 02:30:18,420
Everybody in this world deserves to die.

3862
02:30:23,220 --> 02:30:23,460
I know.

3863
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:24,460
Oh my god, please.

3864
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:29,200
Cease to exist.

3865
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:30,940
Cease to exist, come on!

3866
02:30:31,140 --> 02:30:32,100
Just a little bit more!

3867
02:30:41,370 --> 02:30:42,310
Guys,

3868
02:30:46,480 --> 02:30:47,480
we did it.

3869
02:30:47,480 --> 02:30:48,880
We beat the Ender Dragon.

3870
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:03,460
We beat the Ender Dragon.

3871
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:12,820
Oh my god.

3872
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:22,420
Oh my god.

3873
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:25,120
Oh god.

3874
02:31:25,580 --> 02:31:25,980
I'm crying.

3875
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:37,840
This is not meant for men.

3876
02:31:48,220 --> 02:31:49,980
Oh my god.

3877
02:31:53,380 --> 02:31:58,430
I can't believe...

3878
02:31:58,430 --> 02:32:00,410
I can't believe it ends.

3879
02:32:02,770 --> 02:32:08,450
Even if we somehow managed to survive all of that.

3880
02:32:09,190 --> 02:32:13,650
Seriously, I thought our luck was turning around when I just happened to come across the fortress.

3881
02:32:13,790 --> 02:32:14,810
I was like, oh my god, wait.

3882
02:32:14,990 --> 02:32:16,170
This is actually doable.

3883
02:32:16,290 --> 02:32:17,090
We can do this.

3884
02:32:17,510 --> 02:32:18,650
And then...

3885
02:32:19,550 --> 02:32:20,430
Everything.

3886
02:32:20,970 --> 02:32:22,410
Oh my god.

3887
02:32:22,550 --> 02:32:23,590
The entire...

3888
02:32:23,590 --> 02:32:26,390
The entire cosmos was against this run.

3889
02:32:26,450 --> 02:32:27,070
It's true.

3890
02:32:31,330 --> 02:32:33,530
Oh my god.

3891
02:32:33,990 --> 02:32:37,130
How did we get this seed?

3892
02:32:38,110 --> 02:32:42,450
How did we get it?

3893
02:32:43,870 --> 02:32:46,710
If only we didn't throw it in the beginning.

3894
02:32:47,350 --> 02:32:49,450
We would've had the best...

3895
02:32:49,450 --> 02:32:50,090
We...

3896
02:32:50,090 --> 02:32:52,730
All the other seeds we had started out so well.

3897
02:32:52,870 --> 02:32:53,970
And then we were like, you know what?

3898
02:32:54,010 --> 02:32:55,590
We're just gonna fight with this one.

3899
02:32:55,670 --> 02:32:56,550
We got this.

3900
02:32:57,710 --> 02:32:58,790
We got this.

3901
02:33:03,050 --> 02:33:08,890
We can finally sleep.

3902
02:33:09,690 --> 02:33:14,730
I'm glad we toughened it out to just see what it was like at the end.

3903
02:33:14,730 --> 02:33:16,050
Just to see...

3904
02:33:16,050 --> 02:33:17,410
Just to see...

3905
02:33:17,410 --> 02:33:19,250
I think if tomorrow...

3906
02:33:19,250 --> 02:33:22,390
If we went to bed and we were like, let's do the end and try it tomorrow.

3907
02:33:22,990 --> 02:33:24,550
That we would not have survived.

3908
02:33:26,710 --> 02:33:28,270
No, we wouldn't have survived.

3909
02:33:28,730 --> 02:33:28,830
No.

3910
02:33:29,090 --> 02:33:32,770
It would've been the fastest second stream.

3911
02:33:33,450 --> 02:33:33,870
Yeah.

3912
02:33:34,990 --> 02:33:35,950
Oh my god.

3913
02:33:38,450 --> 02:33:40,370
It was rigged from the start.

3914
02:33:40,430 --> 02:33:42,390
I'm glad that we have all of that on camera.

3915
02:33:48,010 --> 02:33:48,530
Just...

3916
02:33:48,530 --> 02:33:49,270
Just the...

3917
02:33:49,270 --> 02:33:50,230
Me going...

3918
02:33:50,230 --> 02:33:53,530
Finding the stronghold and then being like, what the...

3919
02:33:53,530 --> 02:33:54,930
Wait, the trials...

3920
02:33:54,930 --> 02:33:56,290
The trials are connected.

3921
02:33:56,990 --> 02:33:57,250
No!

3922
02:33:57,850 --> 02:33:59,950
And they were like, it's not supposed to merge.

3923
02:34:00,110 --> 02:34:01,990
It's not supposed to merge.

3924
02:34:02,910 --> 02:34:04,730
But yet, somehow...

3925
02:34:05,350 --> 02:34:07,330
I like how someone was like, you shouldn't have cheated.

3926
02:34:11,290 --> 02:34:13,550
After everything we've been through...

3927
02:34:13,550 --> 02:34:15,290
We can't even have this.

3928
02:34:15,530 --> 02:34:18,350
We played fair the entire time.

3929
02:34:18,650 --> 02:34:21,550
We didn't even give you the seed.

3930
02:34:21,850 --> 02:34:23,350
We tried so hard.

3931
02:34:23,530 --> 02:34:25,770
Trying to figure this out ourselves.

3932
02:34:26,430 --> 02:34:28,530
And now you're like, you shouldn't have cheated.

3933
02:34:29,950 --> 02:34:31,250
Seeds get degrees.

3934
02:34:31,490 --> 02:34:33,650
And you know what letter cheater starts with?

3935
02:34:36,830 --> 02:34:38,410
We needed this.

3936
02:34:38,750 --> 02:34:40,290
It was so cathartic.

3937
02:34:40,290 --> 02:34:43,290
Killing the dragon after everything we've been through.

3938
02:34:43,290 --> 02:34:44,590
I can't believe the trials.

3939
02:34:45,010 --> 02:34:46,690
The trials would have killed us.

3940
02:34:46,790 --> 02:34:47,410
If anything.

3941
02:34:48,530 --> 02:34:50,510
Oh my god.

3942
02:34:51,950 --> 02:34:54,710
Someone just said the seed cheated first.

3943
02:34:55,110 --> 02:34:55,490
Yes!

3944
02:34:55,850 --> 02:34:58,670
The seed cheated first!

3945
02:34:59,110 --> 02:35:01,630
It was all the seed's fault.

3946
02:35:01,630 --> 02:35:02,590
Oh my god.

3947
02:35:08,170 --> 02:35:10,390
Even chat was like, give us the seed.

3948
02:35:10,490 --> 02:35:11,810
We'll find the fortress for you.

3949
02:35:11,930 --> 02:35:12,510
No, no.

3950
02:35:12,970 --> 02:35:14,990
You guys need to sleep.

3951
02:35:15,230 --> 02:35:15,730
Go to bed.

3952
02:35:16,910 --> 02:35:18,370
Just do it tomorrow.

3953
02:35:18,610 --> 02:35:19,270
Go to bed.

3954
02:35:19,690 --> 02:35:22,590
If we did this tomorrow, this would have hurt even more.

3955
02:35:23,630 --> 02:35:24,590
I know, right?

3956
02:35:25,130 --> 02:35:27,370
This would have hurt even more.

3957
02:35:27,490 --> 02:35:30,810
If we went to bed and tried to do this tomorrow.

3958
02:35:31,630 --> 02:35:32,130
Oh my gosh.

3959
02:35:32,950 --> 02:35:35,150
Oh my god, someone made a good point too.

3960
02:35:35,290 --> 02:35:36,930
You don't even know what the trials look like.

3961
02:35:36,990 --> 02:35:38,630
So you would have just walked right in.

3962
02:35:55,730 --> 02:35:56,970
Here's the seed, everybody.

3963
02:35:57,230 --> 02:35:58,970
Seed of this world.

3964
02:35:58,970 --> 02:35:59,930
I'll post it again.

3965
02:35:59,930 --> 02:36:02,350
If you guys want to try and do the seed of this world.

3966
02:36:02,350 --> 02:36:03,390
I'll pin it.

3967
02:36:03,450 --> 02:36:04,450
Here you go, everybody.

3968
02:36:06,270 --> 02:36:07,770
Enjoy, have fun.

3969
02:36:12,050 --> 02:36:14,790
I think this is the most us ending.

3970
02:36:18,670 --> 02:36:21,570
Only we could have conjured this to happen.

3971
02:36:22,090 --> 02:36:25,190
After literally all the bullshit we went through.

3972
02:36:25,770 --> 02:36:26,290
Everything.

3973
02:36:29,270 --> 02:36:31,030
The perfect ending.

3974
02:36:31,430 --> 02:36:33,070
It truly was.

3975
02:36:33,790 --> 02:36:34,530
Oh gosh, okay.

3976
02:36:34,570 --> 02:36:35,690
I'll see you next week.

3977
02:36:36,570 --> 02:36:38,310
Next time when we do it legit.

3978
02:36:38,810 --> 02:36:39,310
Oh yeah.

3979
02:36:39,590 --> 02:36:41,970
We will try it legitimately again sometime.

3980
02:36:42,190 --> 02:36:42,510
We'll try.

3981
02:36:42,810 --> 02:36:45,510
We just need to recover from this.

3982
02:36:47,910 --> 02:36:50,750
When we wanted to do this...

3983
02:36:50,750 --> 02:36:52,770
We didn't think this was gonna happen.

3984
02:36:52,990 --> 02:36:55,190
We didn't think we would...

3985
02:36:55,190 --> 02:36:57,490
We would go through such pain.

3986
02:36:57,490 --> 02:36:59,730
For those who wanted the coordinates of the stronghold.

3987
02:36:59,890 --> 02:37:01,090
I pressed F3.

3988
02:37:01,370 --> 02:37:04,170
When we were exploring the trial room.

3989
02:37:05,910 --> 02:37:08,030
So just find that in the VOD.

3990
02:37:08,210 --> 02:37:09,010
I'm done.

3991
02:37:09,730 --> 02:37:12,070
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go to sleep now.

3992
02:37:12,570 --> 02:37:14,570
I have like this rush of adrenaline.

3993
02:37:14,950 --> 02:37:15,650
That I didn't expect.

3994
02:37:15,670 --> 02:37:17,190
I did too.

3995
02:37:17,330 --> 02:37:18,410
When we found the trial rooms.

3996
02:37:18,550 --> 02:37:20,070
I woke the fuck up.

3997
02:37:20,250 --> 02:37:23,150
I was filled with so much anger.

3998
02:37:23,570 --> 02:37:25,610
And disbelief.

3999
02:37:25,610 --> 02:37:27,270
It was like after...

4000
02:37:27,270 --> 02:37:29,390
We spent like an hour prepping.

4001
02:37:29,550 --> 02:37:31,430
For the ender dragon.

4002
02:37:32,030 --> 02:37:33,870
While we were sleep deprived.

4003
02:37:34,050 --> 02:37:36,070
We spent an hour just leveling up.

4004
02:37:36,530 --> 02:37:38,330
Just not to know.

4005
02:37:38,570 --> 02:37:40,390
That it was just unwinnable in the end.

4006
02:37:40,470 --> 02:37:41,810
It was never winnable.

4007
02:37:42,190 --> 02:37:43,670
You know what's probably the case too.

4008
02:37:43,850 --> 02:37:45,370
Is that like stronghold.

4009
02:37:45,490 --> 02:37:47,270
That your chat mentioned.

4010
02:37:47,530 --> 02:37:48,670
That you passed over.

4011
02:37:48,830 --> 02:37:50,630
Probably was way easier.

4012
02:37:51,990 --> 02:37:54,630
Probably was a proper struggle.

4013
02:37:55,610 --> 02:37:57,910
And we got sent.

4014
02:37:58,090 --> 02:38:00,790
We got sent to the bullshit one.

4015
02:38:01,490 --> 02:38:02,850
We followed the eyes.

4016
02:38:03,110 --> 02:38:05,290
We followed the eyes.

4017
02:38:05,510 --> 02:38:06,710
Just to be here.

4018
02:38:12,350 --> 02:38:16,450
No, I'm deleting this scene.

4019
02:38:16,570 --> 02:38:17,770
We're starting on a new scene.

4020
02:38:17,890 --> 02:38:19,350
When we're doing this again.

4021
02:38:19,350 --> 02:38:22,870
You were starting on a new scene.

4022
02:38:23,590 --> 02:38:25,730
We're not doing this again.

4023
02:38:26,930 --> 02:38:28,470
I'm deleting the world.

4024
02:38:28,710 --> 02:38:30,050
I'm deleting the world.

4025
02:38:33,110 --> 02:38:34,570
They're telling us to wake up.

4026
02:38:34,670 --> 02:38:36,350
We haven't even gone to sleep yet.

4027
02:38:36,490 --> 02:38:37,150
Wake up.

4028
02:38:37,610 --> 02:38:40,390
I lost my dogs in this scene.

4029
02:38:40,630 --> 02:38:41,250
Twice.

4030
02:38:42,850 --> 02:38:43,850
One of them.

4031
02:38:44,110 --> 02:38:45,990
We had that weird glitch.

4032
02:38:45,990 --> 02:38:46,950
That sent us back.

4033
02:38:47,030 --> 02:38:49,570
I woke up and they were gone.

4034
02:38:50,070 --> 02:38:51,450
They never existed.

4035
02:38:51,970 --> 02:38:53,690
They never existed.

4036
02:38:54,570 --> 02:38:55,590
In my life.

4037
02:38:56,430 --> 02:38:58,230
My first dog just disappeared.

4038
02:38:59,710 --> 02:39:02,470
How do I escape from the...

4039
02:39:02,470 --> 02:39:03,830
Oh, there we go.

4040
02:39:06,070 --> 02:39:07,190
I'm back.

4041
02:39:07,470 --> 02:39:08,230
Where are you?

4042
02:39:08,630 --> 02:39:10,110
I'm in the fucking...

4043
02:39:10,110 --> 02:39:12,170
I'm in the bed.

4044
02:39:12,170 --> 02:39:12,190
I'm in the bed.

4045
02:39:13,390 --> 02:39:15,510
I'm in the trial.

4046
02:39:17,730 --> 02:39:19,390
I never left.

4047
02:39:19,550 --> 02:39:21,090
I never left hell.

4048
02:39:21,210 --> 02:39:23,410
I'm back in our...

4049
02:39:23,410 --> 02:39:25,430
In this initial spawn point.

4050
02:39:30,110 --> 02:39:32,070
Are you coming to me?

4051
02:39:32,450 --> 02:39:33,070
I'll come to you.

4052
02:39:33,690 --> 02:39:34,110
I'm here.

4053
02:39:34,290 --> 02:39:37,690
Oh my god.

4054
02:39:37,690 --> 02:39:38,410
Oh my god.

4055
02:39:38,670 --> 02:39:40,690
Let's see where the Eye of Ender takes us now.

4056
02:39:43,450 --> 02:39:44,770
Come on, Eye of Ender.

4057
02:39:45,250 --> 02:39:46,450
Come on, Eye of Ender.

4058
02:39:48,950 --> 02:39:50,730
Take us to a better...

4059
02:39:50,730 --> 02:39:51,790
Are you serious?

4060
02:39:52,350 --> 02:39:53,270
No, it's still going.

4061
02:39:54,710 --> 02:39:56,070
Yeah, it's still going.

4062
02:39:57,690 --> 02:40:00,450
Where are you?

4063
02:40:01,070 --> 02:40:02,490
I'm following the eye.

4064
02:40:03,370 --> 02:40:04,790
I'm gonna TP to you again.

4065
02:40:07,690 --> 02:40:08,710
I hate this seed.

4066
02:40:08,870 --> 02:40:10,270
I wanna burn everything down.

4067
02:40:10,450 --> 02:40:12,790
I hate this seed so much.

4068
02:40:12,930 --> 02:40:14,370
I want it.

4069
02:40:14,670 --> 02:40:15,850
I hate this seed.

4070
02:40:16,050 --> 02:40:16,950
Oh, it's right here.

4071
02:40:19,450 --> 02:40:20,310
Wait, is it?

4072
02:40:20,310 --> 02:40:21,150
No, it's right here.

4073
02:40:21,570 --> 02:40:22,390
Oh, never mind.

4074
02:40:22,470 --> 02:40:22,830
It's still going.

4075
02:40:23,050 --> 02:40:23,930
It's right here.

4076
02:40:25,990 --> 02:40:27,370
Just keep going.

4077
02:40:27,510 --> 02:40:31,230
I wanna know what a good stronghold actually looks like.

4078
02:40:31,650 --> 02:40:32,670
I wanna know.

4079
02:40:34,170 --> 02:40:34,990
We're going.

4080
02:40:37,690 --> 02:40:39,570
We just wanna set the world on fire.

4081
02:40:39,790 --> 02:40:40,850
We just wanna know.

4082
02:40:41,110 --> 02:40:41,490
What's it called?

4083
02:40:41,630 --> 02:40:45,210
What's what called?

4084
02:40:47,530 --> 02:40:48,350
Slash...

4085
02:40:50,690 --> 02:40:51,510
Locate...

4086
02:40:53,230 --> 02:40:54,050
Structure...

4087
02:40:54,050 --> 02:40:54,830
Strong...

4088
02:40:55,910 --> 02:40:56,730
Minecraft...

4089
02:40:58,130 --> 02:40:59,870
1506 blocks away.

4090
02:41:02,330 --> 02:41:03,150
150...

4091
02:41:03,150 --> 02:41:04,370
You can...

4092
02:41:04,370 --> 02:41:05,230
You can...

4093
02:41:05,230 --> 02:41:07,890
You can grab...

4094
02:41:07,890 --> 02:41:08,910
Yeah, I'm burning everything.

4095
02:41:09,510 --> 02:41:10,610
I'm burning it.

4096
02:41:10,750 --> 02:41:11,530
It deserves it.

4097
02:41:12,870 --> 02:41:13,750
I'm just going...

4098
02:41:13,750 --> 02:41:15,830
I'm going spectator mode.

4099
02:41:15,970 --> 02:41:16,730
I'm fucking...

4100
02:41:16,730 --> 02:41:19,210
I can't change my mode, so I'm stuck in creative.

4101
02:41:19,870 --> 02:41:20,290
Okay.

4102
02:41:21,150 --> 02:41:21,650
It's fine.

4103
02:41:23,250 --> 02:41:24,410
Where is this hellhole?

4104
02:41:25,090 --> 02:41:26,470
Where is the second hellhole?

4105
02:41:30,250 --> 02:41:30,810
Burn.

4106
02:41:31,570 --> 02:41:32,130
Burn.

4107
02:41:32,130 --> 02:41:33,830
Min is burning...

4108
02:41:33,830 --> 02:41:35,370
Burning it all down.

4109
02:41:35,750 --> 02:41:38,070
Burninating the countryside.

4110
02:41:39,010 --> 02:41:41,470
Burninating the piggies.

4111
02:41:42,170 --> 02:41:45,410
Burninating everything inside.

4112
02:41:46,450 --> 02:41:47,870
And all the cottages.

4113
02:41:49,810 --> 02:41:50,930
Little cottages.

4114
02:41:53,110 --> 02:41:53,930
It didn't load.

4115
02:41:54,790 --> 02:41:56,570
What didn't load?

4116
02:41:57,250 --> 02:41:58,210
The stronghold.

4117
02:41:58,210 --> 02:41:58,310
Stronghold.

4118
02:42:00,250 --> 02:42:00,990
Oh, look.

4119
02:42:01,110 --> 02:42:02,090
Another trout.

4120
02:42:02,450 --> 02:42:03,950
Oh, we broke it.

4121
02:42:05,810 --> 02:42:06,690
Game mode.

4122
02:42:09,010 --> 02:42:09,450
Creative.

4123
02:42:11,290 --> 02:42:12,670
Wait, teleport me to you.

4124
02:42:13,030 --> 02:42:13,470
How do I...

4125
02:42:13,470 --> 02:42:15,350
How do I teleport to you?

4126
02:42:16,050 --> 02:42:16,870
Wait, no, not yet.

4127
02:42:16,970 --> 02:42:17,730
Don't do it yet.

4128
02:42:17,930 --> 02:42:19,230
I fucking broke it.

4129
02:42:19,430 --> 02:42:20,490
What do you mean you broke it?

4130
02:42:20,510 --> 02:42:21,190
What did you break?

4131
02:42:22,230 --> 02:42:24,370
I teleported somewhere, but it's not working.

4132
02:42:24,770 --> 02:42:25,010
Uh-oh.

4133
02:42:25,650 --> 02:42:26,790
Okay, cursed seed.

4134
02:42:26,930 --> 02:42:28,170
I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

4135
02:42:29,010 --> 02:42:29,690
Where am I?

4136
02:42:31,570 --> 02:42:32,530
Game mode.

4137
02:42:33,070 --> 02:42:33,850
Wait, wait, wait.

4138
02:42:33,970 --> 02:42:35,230
I'm trying to find it.

4139
02:42:35,310 --> 02:42:36,990
I'm trying to find the other stronghold.

4140
02:42:37,450 --> 02:42:38,390
Where is it?

4141
02:42:38,930 --> 02:42:40,310
It literally gave you the coordinates.

4142
02:42:40,430 --> 02:42:41,110
Just click it.

4143
02:42:41,470 --> 02:42:41,750
And then it'll...

4144
02:42:41,750 --> 02:42:44,590
And then it took me to some...

4145
02:42:44,590 --> 02:42:45,850
It fucked up.

4146
02:42:46,890 --> 02:42:47,370
What?

4147
02:42:48,810 --> 02:42:49,770
Like here?

4148
02:42:50,730 --> 02:42:52,430
Is this the same area?

4149
02:42:52,430 --> 02:42:53,130
No.

4150
02:42:53,590 --> 02:42:55,810
Oh my god.

4151
02:42:56,030 --> 02:42:57,970
It took us to...

4152
02:42:57,970 --> 02:42:58,810
There's the trials.

4153
02:42:59,550 --> 02:43:01,770
This is...

4154
02:43:01,770 --> 02:43:02,670
No way.

4155
02:43:03,390 --> 02:43:04,730
No way.

4156
02:43:05,690 --> 02:43:06,530
No way.

4157
02:43:09,470 --> 02:43:10,230
There's...

4158
02:43:10,230 --> 02:43:11,470
No way.

4159
02:43:11,470 --> 02:43:13,530
Wait, teleport me, teleport me, teleport me.

4160
02:43:13,710 --> 02:43:15,450
The stronghold had another trial.

4161
02:43:15,770 --> 02:43:17,210
Teleport me, teleport me.

4162
02:43:19,030 --> 02:43:20,370
Teleport me.

4163
02:43:20,370 --> 02:43:21,630
Okay, okay.

4164
02:43:22,870 --> 02:43:24,430
No fucking way.

4165
02:43:25,290 --> 02:43:26,450
Are you serious?

4166
02:43:26,630 --> 02:43:28,210
Put me in spectator mode.

4167
02:43:28,470 --> 02:43:30,190
Okay, and then...

4168
02:43:30,190 --> 02:43:32,630
Game mode, spectator.

4169
02:43:33,130 --> 02:43:33,770
Look down.

4170
02:43:34,670 --> 02:43:36,310
Oh wait, did you...

4171
02:43:36,310 --> 02:43:39,510
Oh no, I brought the server.

4172
02:43:40,350 --> 02:43:42,250
Hold on, we can go back in, we can go back in.

4173
02:43:42,730 --> 02:43:43,630
Okay, okay, wait.

4174
02:43:43,710 --> 02:43:45,310
I'm waiting for the server to come back.

4175
02:43:45,590 --> 02:43:45,650
Okay.

4176
02:43:47,670 --> 02:43:49,210
Oh my god.

4177
02:43:49,210 --> 02:43:49,430
Oh my god.

4178
02:43:50,830 --> 02:43:53,010
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

4179
02:43:53,910 --> 02:43:54,490
Okay, the...

4180
02:43:54,490 --> 02:43:56,450
The stronghold had...

4181
02:43:56,450 --> 02:43:58,310
Oh my god.

4182
02:43:58,650 --> 02:43:59,830
Where are we?

4183
02:43:59,970 --> 02:44:03,210
Okay, okay, I'm gonna locate...

4184
02:44:03,210 --> 02:44:05,210
Locate structure...

4185
02:44:06,410 --> 02:44:07,130
Stronghold.

4186
02:44:07,810 --> 02:44:08,210
The...

4187
02:44:08,210 --> 02:44:10,270
The other...

4188
02:44:11,030 --> 02:44:12,710
The other one...

4189
02:44:12,710 --> 02:44:14,110
Had one too.

4190
02:44:15,310 --> 02:44:17,190
Are you sure it's not the same one?

4191
02:44:17,190 --> 02:44:19,130
No, no it's not.

4192
02:44:19,250 --> 02:44:20,270
I know it's not.

4193
02:44:20,530 --> 02:44:21,710
I know it's not.

4194
02:44:22,950 --> 02:44:24,850
Oh wait, I'm already in spectator.

4195
02:44:26,790 --> 02:44:27,710
Okay, wait.

4196
02:44:28,230 --> 02:44:30,430
I know it's not, that's the thing.

4197
02:44:32,930 --> 02:44:35,030
Oh wait, I'm not in spectator anymore.

4198
02:44:35,550 --> 02:44:36,230
Teleport me.

4199
02:44:36,870 --> 02:44:39,610
Give me a sec, I'm trying to head to the...

4200
02:44:39,610 --> 02:44:40,790
Okay, it's like...

4201
02:44:42,610 --> 02:44:43,450
Game mode...

4202
02:44:43,770 --> 02:44:44,330
Spectator.

4203
02:44:44,330 --> 02:44:46,490
I need to go to spectator to find this again.

4204
02:44:47,470 --> 02:44:49,210
Okay, I found...

4205
02:44:50,710 --> 02:44:51,270
So...

4206
02:44:51,270 --> 02:44:53,370
Oh my god, there's no way!

4207
02:44:59,490 --> 02:45:01,650
I am wide awake now.

4208
02:45:01,750 --> 02:45:03,150
I don't know how I'm gonna get to sleep.

4209
02:45:07,290 --> 02:45:09,050
It's a different stronghold.

4210
02:45:09,910 --> 02:45:11,570
It's a different one.

4211
02:45:11,570 --> 02:45:13,390
It's a different one.

4212
02:45:13,610 --> 02:45:14,250
Okay.

4213
02:45:14,790 --> 02:45:16,810
Game mode...

4214
02:45:18,830 --> 02:45:19,470
Creative...

4215
02:45:19,470 --> 02:45:20,450
Okay, wait, sorry.

4216
02:45:20,590 --> 02:45:21,850
Game mode, not creative.

4217
02:45:22,790 --> 02:45:23,430
Spectator.

4218
02:45:25,330 --> 02:45:26,470
Go down, look down.

4219
02:45:27,530 --> 02:45:28,750
Look down, look down.

4220
02:45:29,590 --> 02:45:31,530
Oh my god!

4221
02:45:32,290 --> 02:45:33,470
We have to go through...

4222
02:45:33,470 --> 02:45:35,710
We have to go through the trials!

4223
02:45:37,170 --> 02:45:39,290
Through the trials!

4224
02:45:39,290 --> 02:45:41,290
To get to the stronghold!

4225
02:45:43,650 --> 02:45:44,210
Oh...

4226
02:45:45,130 --> 02:45:46,250
My god.

4227
02:45:46,450 --> 02:45:47,730
And it is a different one.

4228
02:45:48,590 --> 02:45:50,190
This is not the same one!

4229
02:45:50,250 --> 02:45:51,450
This is not the same one!

4230
02:45:51,570 --> 02:45:54,730
The stronghold is below!

4231
02:45:55,050 --> 02:45:56,870
The stronghold is below!

4232
02:45:57,330 --> 02:45:58,770
The fucking trials!

4233
02:46:01,590 --> 02:46:03,510
They're like, you will do the trials.

4234
02:46:04,650 --> 02:46:07,070
No matter where you go...

4235
02:46:07,070 --> 02:46:09,530
You will do the trials.

4236
02:46:10,130 --> 02:46:11,950
You will get away.

4237
02:46:12,270 --> 02:46:13,970
Oh my god!

4238
02:46:14,670 --> 02:46:16,330
You will never leave.

4239
02:46:16,710 --> 02:46:19,210
This is the...

4240
02:46:19,210 --> 02:46:22,210
Did you find the eye?

4241
02:46:22,490 --> 02:46:23,530
Where is it?

4242
02:46:23,590 --> 02:46:26,230
Wait, is it below?

4243
02:46:26,510 --> 02:46:27,470
Oh yeah, it's below.

4244
02:46:28,570 --> 02:46:29,890
Where even is it?

4245
02:46:30,110 --> 02:46:32,690
The eye is...

4246
02:46:32,690 --> 02:46:34,770
Oh wait, that's just a...

4247
02:46:37,070 --> 02:46:37,610
The eye!

4248
02:46:38,010 --> 02:46:39,750
I can't even tell.

4249
02:46:39,950 --> 02:46:40,870
Where is the eye?

4250
02:46:41,390 --> 02:46:43,010
I found the bookshelf.

4251
02:46:43,050 --> 02:46:44,930
Yeah, I see all the...

4252
02:46:44,930 --> 02:46:46,710
Where is it?

4253
02:46:46,870 --> 02:46:47,670
Where is it?

4254
02:46:48,930 --> 02:46:49,710
Where is it?

4255
02:46:51,850 --> 02:46:52,490
Huh?

4256
02:46:54,090 --> 02:46:55,270
Where is the eye?

4257
02:46:55,830 --> 02:46:56,310
Is it this?

4258
02:46:57,310 --> 02:46:57,930
Is it not?

4259
02:46:59,250 --> 02:47:00,610
There's no portal.

4260
02:47:01,670 --> 02:47:03,390
There's no portal room.

4261
02:47:03,810 --> 02:47:04,130
Wait.

4262
02:47:04,130 --> 02:47:05,010
There's no way.

4263
02:47:05,170 --> 02:47:07,170
I think this is supposed to be the portal room.

4264
02:47:07,510 --> 02:47:09,650
And it's just a random...

4265
02:47:09,650 --> 02:47:10,730
Wait, what?

4266
02:47:10,770 --> 02:47:13,990
It's just like a random...

4267
02:47:13,990 --> 02:47:15,090
It's like a random...

4268
02:47:15,090 --> 02:47:17,510
I think this is supposed to be the portal room.

4269
02:47:21,470 --> 02:47:29,910
I got eaten by a geode.

4270
02:47:30,470 --> 02:47:32,430
Oh my god.

4271
02:47:32,430 --> 02:47:32,950
Oh my god.

4272
02:47:33,370 --> 02:47:35,050
Wait, there has to be...

4273
02:47:35,050 --> 02:47:36,850
Maybe we passed it.

4274
02:47:37,990 --> 02:47:39,150
Oh, I found it!

4275
02:47:39,590 --> 02:47:41,330
Oh my god.

4276
02:47:41,350 --> 02:47:43,350
It also has no eyes in it though.

4277
02:47:43,670 --> 02:47:45,630
Oh my god.

4278
02:47:45,710 --> 02:47:46,970
I thought that was insane.

4279
02:47:50,850 --> 02:47:52,510
Oh my god.

4280
02:47:52,710 --> 02:47:55,270
That would have been absolute cinema.

4281
02:47:55,270 --> 02:47:55,970
Oh, is it?

4282
02:48:00,150 --> 02:48:01,310
Oh my god.

4283
02:48:11,930 --> 02:48:13,750
It also has no eyes.

4284
02:48:13,850 --> 02:48:14,130
Yeah.

4285
02:48:15,950 --> 02:48:16,830
Oh my god.

4286
02:48:17,310 --> 02:48:18,170
Wait, where did it go?

4287
02:48:18,270 --> 02:48:20,270
I found it and I lost it.

4288
02:48:20,310 --> 02:48:21,570
It's so easy to lose.

4289
02:48:21,570 --> 02:48:22,910
Oh my god.

4290
02:48:22,910 --> 02:48:23,410
Where did it go?

4291
02:48:24,670 --> 02:48:26,510
It's so far away.

4292
02:48:26,610 --> 02:48:27,850
It's so far away, right?

4293
02:48:28,710 --> 02:48:31,290
It's like past the trials.

4294
02:48:31,730 --> 02:48:32,030
Why is this...

4295
02:48:32,030 --> 02:48:35,390
Why is this trial so fucking big?

4296
02:48:40,430 --> 02:48:43,430
I hate this scene.

4297
02:48:43,610 --> 02:48:44,650
I hate this scene.

4298
02:48:44,810 --> 02:48:45,850
I hate this scene.

4299
02:48:46,070 --> 02:48:48,670
I'm so fucking awake.

4300
02:48:48,670 --> 02:48:50,850
It feels like someone purposefully made this.

4301
02:48:51,190 --> 02:48:52,910
Like, this wasn't randomly generated.

4302
02:48:54,310 --> 02:48:55,490
This was the one...

4303
02:48:57,130 --> 02:48:59,350
Notch came back just to make this scene.

4304
02:49:00,450 --> 02:49:02,630
And he's like, one day...

4305
02:49:02,630 --> 02:49:04,810
someone is gonna hit that scene once.

4306
02:49:05,870 --> 02:49:07,170
Oh my god.

4307
02:49:08,930 --> 02:49:10,730
Wait, what's the nether like...

4308
02:49:10,730 --> 02:49:11,670
for this one too?

4309
02:49:12,310 --> 02:49:14,770
No, there's no way it would be that bad, right?

4310
02:49:15,370 --> 02:49:16,830
You're going to the nether too?

4311
02:49:16,830 --> 02:49:18,230
I can't even find...

4312
02:49:18,230 --> 02:49:18,830
No, not nether.

4313
02:49:18,970 --> 02:49:20,310
I meant the eye.

4314
02:49:20,670 --> 02:49:23,130
Oh, I can't find the eye.

4315
02:49:23,330 --> 02:49:24,570
Hold on, I'm gonna teleport to you.

4316
02:49:24,870 --> 02:49:25,070
Okay.

4317
02:49:26,310 --> 02:49:28,130
Place the eyes in there.

4318
02:49:28,230 --> 02:49:30,350
Let's see how bad this spawn is.

4319
02:49:31,530 --> 02:49:32,650
Oh, they're the same?

4320
02:49:32,830 --> 02:49:33,650
Oh, it doesn't matter.

4321
02:49:33,750 --> 02:49:34,530
It was just the seed.

4322
02:49:34,670 --> 02:49:36,970
It was just the seed that gave us the fucking terrible...

4323
02:49:37,730 --> 02:49:38,930
Alright, it didn't matter.

4324
02:49:39,370 --> 02:49:40,630
It didn't fucking matter.

4325
02:49:40,890 --> 02:49:42,430
It didn't fucking matter.

4326
02:49:42,590 --> 02:49:44,430
Apparently, it's the same spawn.

4327
02:49:44,430 --> 02:49:45,890
It's the same end spawn.

4328
02:49:46,470 --> 02:49:46,950
Wow.

4329
02:49:48,310 --> 02:49:49,370
It's just the seed.

4330
02:49:49,470 --> 02:49:50,810
It's based off of all the seeds.

4331
02:49:51,850 --> 02:49:52,310
Wow.

4332
02:49:54,950 --> 02:49:55,930
I have no words.

4333
02:49:56,050 --> 02:49:57,050
I have no words for this.

4334
02:49:58,670 --> 02:50:00,930
Wait, where did the trials disappear to?

4335
02:50:01,070 --> 02:50:01,910
Where is this?

4336
02:50:01,990 --> 02:50:03,130
It's the other side.

4337
02:50:03,250 --> 02:50:06,610
It's the opposite side of the fucking portal.

4338
02:50:07,070 --> 02:50:09,070
Oh my god, they're like not even connected.

4339
02:50:09,570 --> 02:50:11,410
What is this stronghold?

4340
02:50:11,630 --> 02:50:12,550
What is this?

4341
02:50:13,510 --> 02:50:14,170
What?

4342
02:50:15,370 --> 02:50:18,090
You have to go like all the way over...

4343
02:50:18,090 --> 02:50:19,250
all the way here?

4344
02:50:20,130 --> 02:50:21,110
For the eye?

4345
02:50:21,710 --> 02:50:23,250
How do you get here?

4346
02:50:24,330 --> 02:50:25,510
What do you mean?

4347
02:50:26,390 --> 02:50:29,010
It's like not connected properly.

4348
02:50:29,410 --> 02:50:31,190
It's bonkers.

4349
02:50:34,150 --> 02:50:35,570
Oh my god.

4350
02:50:37,070 --> 02:50:39,470
I don't even know how you get to this.

4351
02:50:39,470 --> 02:50:40,050
What?

4352
02:50:41,330 --> 02:50:43,790
It's not connected with the portal area.

4353
02:50:45,790 --> 02:50:47,470
It's like you go down here...

4354
02:50:47,990 --> 02:50:49,570
and then you're in a dead end...

4355
02:50:49,570 --> 02:50:51,790
but you have to mine...

4356
02:50:51,790 --> 02:50:53,710
but it's like you have to know...

4357
02:50:53,710 --> 02:50:55,770
what walls to knock down.

4358
02:51:03,930 --> 02:51:06,210
It's amazing we got this far.

4359
02:51:06,210 --> 02:51:07,450
It's actually...

4360
02:51:07,450 --> 02:51:09,850
It's actually amazing that we got this far.

4361
02:51:10,090 --> 02:51:12,270
It's amazing we didn't make it.

4362
02:51:12,470 --> 02:51:14,930
We were never meant to make it to the stronghold.

4363
02:51:15,750 --> 02:51:16,650
No we weren't.

4364
02:51:16,730 --> 02:51:18,470
We were never meant to.

4365
02:51:19,070 --> 02:51:19,990
GGs Mint.

4366
02:51:20,430 --> 02:51:21,430
GGs Doki.

4367
02:51:22,810 --> 02:51:24,370
I'm glad we stuck it up...

4368
02:51:24,370 --> 02:51:25,930
just to see this hellhole that we made.

4369
02:51:25,930 --> 02:51:26,310
I know.

4370
02:51:28,270 --> 02:51:29,690
You know what?

4371
02:51:30,010 --> 02:51:33,090
Maybe dying right before seeing that atrocity...

4372
02:51:33,090 --> 02:51:34,830
just brought inner peace to me.

4373
02:51:36,210 --> 02:51:36,690
What?

4374
02:51:39,270 --> 02:51:40,790
I think it's just...

4375
02:51:40,790 --> 02:51:44,550
I think if we rested and tried this tomorrow...

4376
02:51:44,550 --> 02:51:46,190
we would've been even more angry.

4377
02:51:46,750 --> 02:51:47,250
I know.

4378
02:51:48,170 --> 02:51:50,070
We would've realized...

4379
02:51:50,070 --> 02:51:52,870
we were well rested just to find out...

4380
02:51:52,870 --> 02:51:54,610
it was always against us.

4381
02:51:54,710 --> 02:51:55,870
We were never meant to...

4382
02:51:55,870 --> 02:51:58,190
We were never meant to beat...

4383
02:51:58,190 --> 02:52:00,130
And with how...

4384
02:52:00,130 --> 02:52:02,230
far away the stronghold was still...

4385
02:52:02,230 --> 02:52:03,850
from where I died...

4386
02:52:03,850 --> 02:52:06,110
I think it would've taken us another hour...

4387
02:52:06,110 --> 02:52:07,330
or so to find it.

4388
02:52:07,470 --> 02:52:08,270
At least.

4389
02:52:08,450 --> 02:52:09,170
It's just...

4390
02:52:09,170 --> 02:52:10,350
Oh my god.

4391
02:52:12,610 --> 02:52:14,670
The drown with the trident...

4392
02:52:14,670 --> 02:52:15,210
was just like...

4393
02:52:15,210 --> 02:52:16,190
I'm saving you.

4394
02:52:16,550 --> 02:52:17,710
Don't keep going.

4395
02:52:18,470 --> 02:52:19,590
Don't do it.

4396
02:52:19,930 --> 02:52:21,050
Don't keep going.

4397
02:52:21,050 --> 02:52:22,590
I'm putting you out of your misery.

4398
02:52:23,750 --> 02:52:24,530
It's over.

4399
02:52:24,670 --> 02:52:25,410
Turn back.

4400
02:52:25,610 --> 02:52:26,190
Turn back.

4401
02:52:31,220 --> 02:52:32,640
Oh my god.

4402
02:52:32,800 --> 02:52:36,240
Thank you everybody for...

4403
02:52:36,240 --> 02:52:38,040
going on this journey with us.

4404
02:52:38,140 --> 02:52:39,500
Wild adventure.

4405
02:52:39,740 --> 02:52:41,420
I can't wait to do this again.

4406
02:52:41,880 --> 02:52:44,040
The sun is literally up so I'm going to go...

4407
02:52:44,040 --> 02:52:45,640
attempt some sleep for a couple of hours.

4408
02:52:46,080 --> 02:52:46,620
Me too.

4409
02:52:47,320 --> 02:52:49,580
I have dance lessons later.

4410
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:50,800
Oh my god.

4411
02:52:53,920 --> 02:52:55,120
GG everyone.

4412
02:52:55,120 --> 02:52:57,540
We're both going to head to bed now.

4413
02:52:57,900 --> 02:52:59,080
I'll talk to you later.

4414
02:52:59,300 --> 02:52:59,900
Bye.

4415
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:03,300
Remember to check out our tickets by the way.

4416
02:53:03,600 --> 02:53:04,640
Everybody check out the concert.

4417
02:53:05,740 --> 02:53:07,560
If we sell out we'll play...

4418
02:53:07,560 --> 02:53:08,420
Minecraft in 3D.

4419
02:53:08,980 --> 02:53:10,980
We'll do this scene in 3D.

4420
02:53:12,830 --> 02:53:15,500
We'll do the scene again in 3D.

4421
02:53:15,720 --> 02:53:17,390
We have the...

4422
02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:19,060
scene numbers anyway.

4423
02:53:19,820 --> 02:53:21,460
If we sell out...

4424
02:53:21,460 --> 02:53:25,100
the concert we'll do this exact scene...

4425
02:53:25,100 --> 02:53:26,100
in 3D.

4426
02:53:27,940 --> 02:53:29,140
GG's everybody.

4427
02:53:29,420 --> 02:53:30,120
Bye bye.

4428
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:31,760
Hold on.

4429
02:53:32,060 --> 02:53:33,940
Can I send you this real quick?

4430
02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:34,860
Hold on.

4431
02:53:35,320 --> 02:53:36,440
Look at this tweet.

4432
02:53:51,360 --> 02:53:52,760
Mio, I mean...

4433
02:53:52,760 --> 02:53:54,380
I just saw your tweet.

4434
02:53:54,380 --> 02:53:55,740
This is insane.

4435
02:53:55,820 --> 02:53:57,460
We really managed to...

4436
02:53:57,460 --> 02:54:01,700
Look at this.

4437
02:54:02,020 --> 02:54:03,420
Look at this tweet.

4438
02:54:04,300 --> 02:54:06,780
I hate this so much.

4439
02:54:07,860 --> 02:54:09,220
Holy shit.

4440
02:54:16,040 --> 02:54:16,880
How?

4441
02:54:17,600 --> 02:54:19,900
How is this possible?

4442
02:54:21,880 --> 02:54:23,560
No fucking way.

4443
02:54:24,320 --> 02:54:25,980
Oh my god.

4444
02:54:26,240 --> 02:54:26,780
I'm leaving.

4445
02:54:26,780 --> 02:54:27,540
I'm leaving.

4446
02:54:27,940 --> 02:54:29,140
I'm done.

4447
02:54:31,520 --> 02:54:34,480
Good night everybody.

4448
02:54:35,380 --> 02:54:36,680
Or good morning.

4449
02:54:37,160 --> 02:54:37,440
Bye.

4450
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:39,840
Bye bye.

4451
02:54:52,080 --> 02:54:54,020
Thank you everybody.

4452
02:54:55,180 --> 02:54:56,340
Thank you.

4453
02:54:56,520 --> 02:54:58,020
This was so much fun.

4454
02:54:59,440 --> 02:55:00,720
Thank you.

4455
02:55:05,980 --> 02:55:06,660
Otsumito.

4456
02:55:07,520 --> 02:55:07,600
Otsumito.

4457
02:55:07,780 --> 02:55:09,740
I'm gonna go nap.

4458
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:10,940
I'm gonna still try...

4459
02:55:10,940 --> 02:55:12,760
and wake up at...

4460
02:55:12,760 --> 02:55:14,200
my normal time.

4461
02:55:14,980 --> 02:55:15,340
10.

4462
02:55:15,760 --> 02:55:18,060
So we'll see how that works.

4463
02:55:25,780 --> 02:55:27,520
That was fun.

4464
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:28,380
That was silly.

4465
02:55:29,060 --> 02:55:29,880
What a time.

4466
02:55:30,100 --> 02:55:31,960
Only we could do that, right?

4467
02:55:35,560 --> 02:55:36,620
Thanks guys.

4468
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:37,740
Thank you.

4469
02:55:37,880 --> 02:55:38,440
Otsumito.

4470
02:55:39,020 --> 02:55:39,480
Bye bye.
