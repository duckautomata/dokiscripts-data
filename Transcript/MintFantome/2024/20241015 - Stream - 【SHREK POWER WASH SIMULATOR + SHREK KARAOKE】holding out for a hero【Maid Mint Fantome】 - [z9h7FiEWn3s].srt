I can't just every time!

Wait, hold on.

19
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,930
I forgot to do something, actually.

20
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,090
One second!

21
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,430
One second, one second, one second.

22
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,390
One second.

23
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,350
I forgot to do something.

24
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,230
Hold.

25
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:26,590
OK.

26
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,010
I fixed it.

27
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,330
OK, good.

28
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,850
Hi boss, you're cute.

29
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,310
OK, bye.

30
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,090
Bye.

31
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,090
Don't leave!

32
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,490
Hey Minto, you want any waffles?

33
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,230
I'm making waffles.

34
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,030
You like waffles, right?

35
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,050
Anyone else want waffles?

36
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,910
I'm making waffles!

37
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,170
Oh my gosh.

38
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,210
Good thing you're making waffles, because I hate pancakes.

39
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,790
Well, I don't hate pancakes.

40
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,950
I just don't like them, you know.

41
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,690
Minto is cute forever.

42
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,670
We just started!

43
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:07,270
Let's not get too into lying right at the beginning of the stream.

44
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,550
You don't want to form bad habits.

45
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,670
It takes one Minto stream to form a bad habit, I'm telling you.

46
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,530
Waffles are better.

47
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,610
I just don't like how doughy pancakes are, you know.

48
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,210
And then they like... I don't know.

49
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:29,010
Is there something about pancakes where they absorb the flavor, but they sometimes don't taste like the flavor, you know?

50
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,210
I was about to head to sleep.

51
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,650
Go to bed!

52
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,870
I'll try and be quiet.

53
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,230
I can't guarantee that.

54
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,310
Cutie.

55
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,260
Crawfles.

56
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,380
Is that a croissant waffle?

57
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,860
But pancakes drenched in syrup is so good.

58
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,420
But they're like too doughy, right?

59
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,540
Minto hates my favorite breakfast food.

60
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,580
It's so over.

61
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,800
Happy Thanksgiving, Canada!

62
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,540
This year I'm thankful that Minto is Minto.

63
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,820
Thank you, dog strings!

64
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,180
Happy Thanksgiving!

65
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,700
Crepes?

66
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,280
Oh, crepe waffle.

67
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,240
That sounds good.

68
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,480
I like crepes.

69
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,340
I like crepes a lot, actually.

70
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,340
She's making the case for Krispies and dunking on sauce.

71
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,560
No, no, no.

72
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,900
It's different.

73
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,580
Put some chocolate chips in those pancakes?

74
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm just... I'm just not a fan.

75
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,120
I like waffles.

76
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,060
I'm making waffles.

77
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,340
Today we're gonna be playing Shrek.

78
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,920
Not a game.

79
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,400
But, well, yes, it is a game.

80
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,460
But I...

81
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,440
I...

82
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,300
Happy Thanksgiving to my fellow Canadians.

83
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,460
I'm very grateful to have met you at Otakutan.

84
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,920
I'm grateful for my job, good health, best Oshi, etc.

85
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,340
Gustav Mint, thank you!

86
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,240
It is a game.

87
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,060
But it's not like Shrek the game.

88
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,660
It's Power Wash Simulator.

89
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,280
DLC of Shrek time.

90
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,820
Duloc.

91
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,780
Let's go in.

92
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,480
Ah, there you are.

93
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,820
What took... I can't speak.

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,900
What took you so long?

95
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,840
What even is a touche?

96
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,180
Encounter a curious and stubborn stain on the way?

97
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,520
As you are no doubt aware, I am soon to be made king.

98
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,280
Is this Lord Farquaad talking to us?

99
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,000
By marrying the most beautiful damsel in all the world.

100
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,280
Snow White.

101
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,900
No wait, I rejected her.

102
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,760
It was the one after.

103
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,140
Mint Phantom.

104
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,740
Minto Swample.

105
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,020
When are you playing Shrek Super Slam?

106
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,600
What's that?

107
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,940
It literally says on the bottom.

108
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,180
I wasn't there yet.

109
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,400
I wasn't there yet.

110
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:36,640
No matter, the point is that the privilege of rescuing said maiden from her dragonly abode was won by a flatulent ogre.

111
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,940
Which left the vanquished knights here in Duloc somewhat...

112
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,060
Aggrieved?

113
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,980
What does that mean?

114
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,660
It's like aggravated?

115
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,360
That's what I thought it said at first.

116
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,440
Consequently, they let vent their frustrations rampaging through the town on their way out.

117
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:09,660
And I'm not having my bride to be's imminent procession soured by unruly actions of ennobling greats.

118
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,860
I found out recently that Lord Farquaad is supposed to sound like Lord Fuckquad.

119
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,880
And it blew my mind.

120
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,320
Farquaad.

121
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,760
Fuckquad.

122
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,020
So is the R silent?

123
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,400
So feeling a little melancholy after seeing the end of MGS3 again, let's wash away the feels with some Shrek silliness.

124
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,080
Yeah!

125
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,580
I guess I can kind of hear it.

126
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,660
It's like a...

127
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,660
Oh gosh, there's...

128
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,220
Cartoons do this all the time, but Dreamworks?

129
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,720
Oh, is that a toilet?

130
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,840
Oh wait, I think that's Lord Farquaad.

131
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:03,660
lol lol I think it's meant to look like a toilet, right?

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,400
Rest assured, knight, those responsible for this outrage have been incarcerated.

133
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,480
How do I...

134
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,580
There's a way to like...

135
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,640
No, hold on.

136
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,800
I forgot to look at the controls.

137
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,020
One moment, everybody.

138
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:23,960
Controls.

139
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,500
There's one where it's like, you know...

140
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,060
Aim mode?

141
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,500
I think so.

142
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,700
It's a trash can.

143
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,300
Oh!

144
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,800
No...

145
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,420
Are you sure?

146
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,180
It's the public toilet.

147
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,280
Like, very public, you know?

148
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,300
It's the very public toilet...

149
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,200
Of...

150
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,400
This city.

151
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,020
The most public.

152
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,940
Yeah, we gotta clean it.

153
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,460
Oh boy.

154
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,680
It's gonna take a while, isn't it?

155
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,460
This place is humongous!

156
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,880
Oh, it's a mascot mask!

157
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,580
Oh, I see it now!

158
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,520
I see it now, I see it now.

159
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,460
Oh my gosh.

160
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,560
I still rest my case.

161
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,820
Remember when Markiplier Farquad said...

162
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,760
Simpler internet times.

163
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,540
Where did that come from?

164
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,280
Why is that a thing anyway?

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,160
I do not know the lore.

166
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,180
Deep fried meme.

167
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,180
I know some people hate the subtle...

168
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,180
Whatever, the subtle...

169
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,940
Foreshadowing trend recently, but I kind of love it.

170
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,060
It really feels like we're so close to YouTube poops coming back.

171
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,040
Which could be a good thing.

172
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Or a bad thing.

173
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,720
I don't know.

174
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,320
I don't know how the internet is nowadays, but...

175
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,920
I'm kind of here for it.

176
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,980
It just reminds me of a simpler time, right?

177
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,500
Let the memes flow.

178
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,460
I kind of went on like a...

179
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,020
I went on a nostalgia trip the other day...

180
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,760
And I watched a bunch of the We Are Number One...

181
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,900
Like mashups and things like that.

182
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,080
Just for funsies, I was like...

183
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,060
This is like one of those rare times when it feels like...

184
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,840
The internet has banded together...

185
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,960
For a common goal, you know?

186
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,920
Robbie Rotten, my beloved.

187
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,820
I know!

188
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,240
I loved...

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
Loved those videos.

190
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,720
So good.

191
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,260
I did that too a few weeks ago.

192
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,940
Did you also see that it was like the anniversary recently?

193
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,480
And that's why you also binge watched it?

194
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,000
I often caught myself watching old Vines compilations.

195
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,700
Oh yeah!

196
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,820
Those ones are really easy to get into.

197
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,480
And yes, the title is not clickbait.

198
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,820
I will be doing some Shrek karaoke...

199
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,660
Later on.

200
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,300
Maybe like once I clean this one, you know?

201
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,660
We'll do karaoke and we'll clean...

202
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,320
Just kind of like how I did...

203
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,000
If you watch the Spongebob DLC one that I did...

204
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,680
I did some Spongebob songs while I...

205
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,400
After I cleaned.

206
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,860
So it'll be the same.

207
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,940
Break stuff.

208
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,580
My throat is recovering.

209
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,540
There's plans of collabing with Leah again.

210
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
Yeah, I mean, not that I have plans...

211
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,460
But I would love to collab with her again.

212
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,140
She's actually in a thing that I'm working on right now.

213
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,120
Thank you for gracing the VMute stage with KLP48.

214
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,680
Thank you!

215
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,540
Thank you so much!

216
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,600
Oh my gosh, KLP was so cute!

217
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,100
They were so...

218
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,120
Oh my gosh, I was like...

219
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,820
I knew their setlist beforehand, obviously...

220
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,160
Because I was told when I will be coming on and everything like that.

221
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,180
So when I saw that they were going to do Shonichi...

222
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,820
Which is one of my favorite AKB songs ever...

223
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,120
I was like...

224
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,460
So excited.

225
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,490
Favorite ice cream?

226
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,510
Cookies and cream.

227
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,790
You thought I was going to say mint chocolate, huh?

228
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,690
Will you sing songs from the Shrek musical or will I be Smash Mouth?

229
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,630
There's not just Smash Mouth songs.

230
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,570
But I've never seen the Shrek musical.

231
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:23,910
Is it any good?

232
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:27,870
Is it any good?

233
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,130
Oh my gosh, I'm kind of excited for the Wicked movie though.

234
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,370
People are really ranting and raving about it.

235
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,310
I don't really know anything about it except Ariana Grande is in it.

236
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:38,650
But everybody...

237
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,350
All the posts that I've seen about it...

238
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,110
They make it sound so good, I'm like...

239
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,330
Is this actually going to be good?

240
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:45,990
Is it going to be good?

241
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,470
Shrek musical was pretty mid.

242
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,590
Actually, there's like one...

243
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,330
Song that I've seen...

244
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,310
Ye olde trash.

245
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,630
There's like one thing I've seen about Shrek musical.

246
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,410
And it was like one of Fiona's songs and it has like...

247
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,490
I don't remember exactly how it went so I don't think I'd be able to sing it but...

248
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,330
It had like her younger version singing and then...

249
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,990
She like sings throughout the years.

250
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,130
Mid?

251
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:17,990
Nah, it's peak.

252
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,470
The fandom wars.

253
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,850
Peak versus mid Shrek the musical.

254
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,590
Shrek is like one of those rare movie series though that like...

255
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,830
Well actually, wait, wasn't there one movie that people really didn't like?

256
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,490
I was going to say, all the sequels are all good.

257
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,890
Shrek 3, yeah, the third one.

258
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,670
Ripperoni.

259
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,810
Shrek, if you're listening to this...

260
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,930
I don't think it was bad, maybe.

261
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,850
Actually, I don't know.

262
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,370
Why are you guys like... What is this graffiti?

263
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,070
Minto time.

264
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,530
Did you guys have a good weekend?

265
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,790
What did you do this weekend?

266
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,410
Five is in the works.

267
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,090
Is it actually?

268
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,090
I'll see it... I'll believe it when I...

269
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,490
When I see a trailer.

270
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,490
Was a lazy weekend.

271
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,450
That's good though, that's not always bad, right?

272
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,940
Oh my god, furry fan art.

273
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,780
They drew their fursonas on the wall.

274
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,380
What are these?

275
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,800
I don't want to like get rid of them.

276
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,480
They're

277
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:50,970
like...

278
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,310
That's horses.

279
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,330
This is a horse.

280
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,550
This is not a horse.

281
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,410
It is a horse, not horses.

282
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,150
Just like Pokemon, okay.

283
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,410
Guys...

284
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,690
Maybe don't bring up Pokemon right now.

285
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,330
Minto streamed my birthday with Jabril!

286
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,890
Oh my gosh, curse name.

287
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,510
Wait, sorry.

288
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,490
Not curse name, sorry.

289
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,470
Happy birthday!

290
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,350
Happy birthday to you.

291
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,330
Happy birthday to you.

292
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,230
Happy birthday dear Jabril.

293
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:42,210
Happy birthday to you.

294
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,170
Happy birthday!

295
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,710
I don't know, okay.

296
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:00,730
I didn't read so much of everything that had come out.

297
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,690
Because, you know...

298
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:09,430
I also didn't look into the credibility of it all, you know?

299
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,590
So, I don't know.

300
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:18,390
But here's my take on if something like this is legitimate, you know?

301
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:21,930
Like...

302
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,830
And you know, if you're like, this is so unbased, whatever.

303
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,670
You know, it could be unbased, whatever.

304
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,130
But...

305
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,830
So it's like...

306
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,690
It'd be one thing if...

307
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:36,950
Because people are like...

308
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,890
There's like people arguing about it.

309
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,770
Being like, this is really cool mythos.

310
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,370
Like, you guys are just being babies about not understanding the mythos.

311
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,630
And this is why we'll never have a more adult-centered game.

312
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,690
But I'm just kind of like...

313
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,550
Wait.

314
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,270
Evan, is it your birthday too?

315
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,550
Sorry to double up birthday songs.

316
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,890
I turned 24 today, thanks for an entire year.

317
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,710
I mean, six months of amazing memories.

318
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,030
I can't wait to stick around with you in this amazing community.

319
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,610
Evan, happy birthday!

320
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,150
Happy birthday to you.

321
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,830
Happy birthday to you.

322
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,430
Happy birthday, dear Evan and your kazoo covers.

323
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:24,730
Happy birthday to you.

324
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,970
Put some mite strips and hives today.

325
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,450
I've been working on rendering wax.

326
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,610
Tomorrow, I start on my Minto candle!

327
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,590
Oh my gosh, I can't wait to see.

328
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,430
Minto cleans properly.

329
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,470
Doki triggered OCD with this.

330
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,750
I mean, it's Doki.

331
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,770
I wonder if there will be a Metal Gear reference in Power Wash.

332
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:54,130
Since not even in your Pico Park 2 collab could you escape the notorious cardboard box.

333
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,370
I don't...

334
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,230
What if...

335
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,830
Oh my gosh.

336
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,070
What if...

337
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,810
They made a Metal Gear world?

338
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,410
That would be...

339
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,850
Like you...

340
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:03,370
You...

341
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,770
Power Wash Rex?

342
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,630
Actually, it would probably be...

343
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,130
Well, I don't know.

344
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,410
They would probably do like a...

345
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,410
I don't know if they would do 3 for Delta or...

346
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,190
Or what?

347
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,750
But anyway, I was talking about...

348
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,290
The...

349
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,150
The mythos, right?

350
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,990
Again, I see people being like...

351
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,690
Oh, you know, it's based off of this.

352
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,870
It's based off of that.

353
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,330
I think my...

354
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,130
My...

355
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,710
It's not my issue, but I'm just like...

356
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,070
Why didn't they release it then?

357
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,150
Like, why didn't they create stuff that's just like...

358
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,790
Oh, you know, this is a mythos about this creature.

359
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,050
And then...

360
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,330
And then, you know, someone playing the games could be like...

361
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,490
Oh my gosh, this moment happens in the games...

362
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,950
With this creature.

363
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,030
I wonder if it's influenced by the mythos.

364
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,670
But instead, they kind of like...

365
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,990
Keep it private for their own self?

366
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,810
It's...

367
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,570
It's...

368
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,730
It's weird.

369
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,710
Because it's so private.

370
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,110
So it makes me feel like they are putting stuff in the games...

371
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,790
With their...

372
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,210
Quote unquote mythos.

373
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,250
But it's only like an inside joke to them.

374
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,450
So I don't...

375
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,010
That's why it kind of annoys me.

376
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:25,050
Okay.

377
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,190
Writers do that all the time?

378
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,790
That doesn't make it okay, in my opinion.

379
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,530
I think you can have, you know...

380
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:40,950
Your own...

381
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,210
You know, stuff that you want to write about.

382
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,210
But like, also, why not, you know, share in it?

383
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,770
Like, with the audience.

384
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,310
I don't know.

385
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,530
It's just...

386
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,330
That's super normal for a writing process.

387
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:56,930
But I...

388
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,970
But then also...

389
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,510
I don't know.

390
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,330
Like I said, why don't you share that then?

391
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,350
With the audience.

392
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,550
Be like...

393
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,010
Here's like, you know...

394
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,930
The only thing I can relate it to is like...

395
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,590
How...

396
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,930
With the Harry Potter series...

397
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,290
She put out like books.

398
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,250
Like, there were extra books.

399
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,930
That were like...

400
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,450
What's it called?

401
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,370
That were like, this is the lore on...

402
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,470
This is like the book that they read in class.

403
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,710
You know, so you kind of get that context.

404
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,850
Like, why don't you put it out that?

405
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:30,930
Like that.

406
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,680
That's the only way I can...

407
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,720
That's the only like...

408
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,160
What's it called?

409
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,060
The only...

410
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Comparison I can make.

411
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,500
But there's like...

412
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,860
Series all the time that were like...

413
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,320
Make a...

414
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:51,780
What's it called?

415
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,160
A...

416
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,080
Like extra books and stuff.

417
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,560
That are like, explaining lore and things like that.

418
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,980
Like I said, you know, I can be wrong.

419
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,240
Or rather, I don't think I'm wrong.

420
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,100
It's just my opinion.

421
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,860
It's just my opinion.

422
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,680
Zun had a few lore books.

423
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,300
Yeah.

424
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,060
Exactly.

425
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,060
Don't let the weird Pokemon lore distract you...

426
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,840
From the fact that we have art of what...

427
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,800
Dugtrio looks like under the dirt.

428
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,660
Wait, actually...

429
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,660
I'm choosing my wording very carefully because...

430
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,200
I don't wanna say anything.

431
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,020
I don't wanna say any...

432
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,060
Specific words.

433
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,540
In case...

434
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,160
In case people are on the lookout.

435
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,660
And are like...

436
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,740
Someone mentioned it on...

437
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,360
Online.

438
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,580
I must take them down.

439
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,160
Went to Anime Impulse last weekend.

440
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,320
Had fun and bought some Minto merch.

441
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,000
Can not wait for the Minto Flash.

442
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,240
Thank you!

443
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,180
Oh my gosh!

444
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm so happy there was Minto merch there.

445
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,760
Thank you!

446
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,600
RIP to all Typhlosion fans.

447
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,300
It's me.

448
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,920
I was a Typhlosion girly.

449
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,940
I mean, I still am.

450
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,240
But when I played the games and everything.

451
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,180
Always picked Cyndaquil.

452
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,140
Cyndaquil is my little guy.

453
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,140
Love that guy.

454
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,560
I love that guy.

455
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,490
So cute.

456
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,290
I haven't touched...

457
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,130
I don't know the last Pokemon game I...

458
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,730
I guess Sword and Shield was the last new one I did.

459
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,830
I think.

460
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,710
Shrek Doko.

461
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:04,610
Shrek!

462
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,650
What happened...

463
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,190
Here?

464
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,710
Do you think he's behind this window?

465
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,950
Shreketh...

466
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,870
Appeareth!

467
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,350
Oh god!

468
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,310
It's horrible!

469
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,310
Take... Oh, heed.

470
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,830
Why is only this part of the town so messed up?

471
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,330
I thought it said take weed also, okay?

472
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:04,730
That's why I was like kind of staring at it, like...

473
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,030
Okay, hold on.

474
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,090
Guys, we can make Shrek in the window.

475
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,790
We can... Wait...

476
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,830
We can make Shrek...

477
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,490
In the window.

478
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,350
Wait, hold on.

479
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,850
Get out my Shrek.

480
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,250
That's Shrek, it's not an alien.

481
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,010
This is him.

482
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,730
He's in the window.

483
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,550
There he... Oh my gosh, wait, it looks exactly...

484
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,710
Even the X... Even the cross eyes!

485
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,410
Mine had the cross eyes!

486
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,010
Oh my god, it looks exactly the same!

487
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,230
It looks exactly the same!

488
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,430
Save!

489
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,600
Trash.

490
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,760
Well, that's not very old timey.

491
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,560
Yee trash.

492
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,340
I'm sorry, yay trash.

493
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,880
Knights?

494
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,480
Knights Ruth!

495
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,000
No!

496
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,880
They left so much graffiti!

497
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,190
Knights.

498
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,030
Ruth!

499
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,710
You shall rue the day!

500
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,470
Knights.

501
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,060
Let's clean.

502
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,280
Yeah, what an exciting weekend!

503
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,140
There were so many things that happened.

504
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,760
So many things that happened.

505
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,020
And...

506
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,720
You know...

507
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,800
I guess there was a convention, Anime Impulse.

508
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,660
Next weekend is big too?

509
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,820
What's next weekend?

510
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:46,910
In old timey English, Y is actually a TH sound.

511
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,090
So in proper middle English, that's just the trash.

512
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,410
So it's actually TH sound, it's not yee trash.

513
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,950
So it's not yee old, it's the old?

514
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,930
No, it's gotta be yee old.

515
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,330
No way!

516
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,670
Sorry to ruin it.

517
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:19,230
I'm literally flushing my mind of this information.

518
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,300
Shhh...

519
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,780
Yee old trash.

520
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,880
No!

521
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,680
Brainwashing live on stream.

522
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,180
No!

523
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,700
It's old timey, that's why they say yee.

524
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
You know?

525
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,420
Any good horror games lately?

526
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,280
Apparently Silent Hill 2 is pretty good.

527
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,740
Apparently.

528
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,100
I don't think I'll stream it.

529
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,560
But I want to play it.

530
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,260
Yeah.

531
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,400
As a Silent Hill fan.

532
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,320
Good transition, boss.

533
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,400
Yeah, it was...

534
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,720
Yeah.

535
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,640
What do you mean, eh?

536
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:55,760
I think, actually, I feel like people's expectations were just very low.

537
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,840
And so, because... I don't know, I can't say.

538
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,640
I haven't...

539
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,880
I haven't played it, so I don't know.

540
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,300
It could genuinely be good.

541
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,840
Which I don't think... I'm not saying that it's not.

542
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,600
Like, I'm just saying, like...

543
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,660
I think people's expectations were so low that...

544
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,920
When they got something way better than what they expected, they're like...

545
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,440
Game of the year!

546
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,080
Game of the year!

547
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,520
You've watched streams?

548
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:19,820
No.

549
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,760
I haven't really watched anything...

550
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,160
Of it.

551
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,020
Farquad flower display.

552
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,540
Oh my god, my eyes.

553
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,460
This is a lot.

554
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,320
Did Doki ever get to Shrek's swamp?

555
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,760
Isn't there, like, several...

556
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,080
Levels you have to...

557
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,280
She did?

558
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:51,860
Oh, okay.

559
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:57,650
Are the trees fake or something?

560
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:58,510
Like, why?

561
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:00,890
Actually, do I have any money?

562
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,690
I have 200 money.

563
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:05,870
Shop.

564
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,130
Let's see.

565
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,610
Let's get maybe...

566
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,850
Some cleaning liquids.

567
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,630
Wait, there's new power washers.

568
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,730
Oh, I need stars?

569
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,390
Oh my god.

570
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,810
So much money.

571
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,810
I mean...

572
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,470
She did after losing her mind.

573
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,330
I do feel like expectations were low.

574
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:35,450
My only... My thing is I wonder how much was it...

575
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,470
Konami's direction and how much was Bloober's direction.

576
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,810
Bloober team's direction, but...

577
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,970
Hey, I mean...

578
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,290
If it's...

579
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,530
If it's a good remake, cool.

580
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,010
If it's a good remake, why not?

581
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,350
Shop.

582
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,150
Liquid.

583
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,770
What do you mean out of stock?

584
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:04,790
What?

585
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,450
So I can't get any assistance with this?

586
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,590
This is so messed up.

587
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,640
Liquid.

588
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,620
Liquid.

589
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,670
Guys, this is...

590
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,770
This is unrelated.

591
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,890
But I almost... I'm gonna have a confession right now.

592
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,130
I almost cancelled stream today.

593
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,490
I took a walk right before stream.

594
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,350
It was so nice outside.

595
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,610
I was like, what if I just...

596
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,010
What if I just said, sorry guys, I gotta walk.

597
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,450
I gotta...

598
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,410
I just gotta... I gotta go outside.

599
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,990
I gotta take a walk.

600
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,450
It was so nice.

601
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,130
But also, I just... I have a lot to do.

602
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:58,850
A lot to finish.

603
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,990
I'm kind of really stressed about...

604
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,150
My debut.

605
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,990
I'm hoping everything will be...

606
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,070
Done in time, but...

607
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,610
I'm hoping everything will be done in time.

608
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:15,390
Ashes!

609
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,630
Can you power wash my brain next, please?

610
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,810
I have worms up there.

611
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,970
Oh, you and me both, girl.

612
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,430
You got this.

613
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,250
It's really, you know...

614
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,730
It's less me and more so...

615
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,790
People working on things for me.

616
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,490
Which, you know...

617
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,250
I don't want to...

618
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,190
Put so much stress on them.

619
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,070
So if they're just like...

620
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,570
Minto is not gonna get done.

621
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,910
I'm like, aw man, we'll have to delay it.

622
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,610
We'll have to delay it a couple days or so.

623
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,490
Hopefully not.

624
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,150
You know, usually...

625
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,870
I would just plan it for any...

626
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,750
Whatever day.

627
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,130
Since it's Halloween...

628
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,130
And if it's not on Halloween...

629
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,910
I think it'll...

630
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,950
Quote-unquote ruin the effect maybe a little bit.

631
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,150
But...

632
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,470
I don't know.

633
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,870
I don't know.

634
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,630
Feeling a little stressed about it.

635
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,450
Hopefully it all works out though.

636
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,780
We'll be here regardless.

637
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,900
Thank you.

638
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,240
Thank you.

639
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,720
If it's not on Halloween, guys...

640
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,380
We'll just pretend it's Halloween, okay?

641
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,520
Or all my theming will...

642
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,420
Be for naught.

643
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,860
If you say the Halloween a few days later...

644
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,600
My Halloween will be a few days later.

645
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,160
What would be so bad about extending Halloween anyway?

646
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,380
That actually sounds like the best thing ever.

647
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,700
To me.

648
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,580
Maybe.

649
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,090
But of course I'll give you guys a heads up.

650
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,290
If that were to occur.

651
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,910
Because I don't want someone to be like...

652
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,990
You know how some people can be.

653
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,630
They're like, I take off work for this.

654
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,430
And I'm like...

655
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:27,930
Why?

656
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:28,850
It's just a stream.

657
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,330
Can you tell me I'm a rockstar?

658
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,610
Hey now, hey now, hey now.

659
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,620
Not everybody can be a rockstar.

660
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,960
What kind of rockstar things have you done?

661
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,140
Huh?

662
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,840
Have you...

663
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,130
Have you...

664
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,160
Have you had strippers on your party bus?

665
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,420
That sounds like a rockstar thing.

666
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,120
Have you...

667
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,360
Have you broken a guitar string?

668
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,940
That's a rockstar thing.

669
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,220
I played guitar hero once.

670
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:15,910
Impressive.

671
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,350
You're a rockstar.

672
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:23,810
No.

673
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,330
Have you had strippers on your band bus, Ms. Mint?

674
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,530
No, and I'm not claiming to be a rockstar.

675
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,030
I'm not asking for someone...

676
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:34,270
Okay.

677
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,530
If I tell you you're a rockstar...

678
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,690
It's because you're...

679
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,910
You're cosplaying.

680
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,750
You know?

681
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,310
Cute rockstar cosplay.

682
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:50,130
If Snake and Minto Minto merged, what month would they be?

683
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:50,950
Month?

684
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,590
What month would we be?

685
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,170
I changed my mind.

686
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,810
Getting degraded like this is even better than validation.

687
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,270
Degrade me more.

688
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,510
Hurt me more, Minto.

689
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,690
Oh dear Christ.

690
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,290
Did we awaken something in you?

691
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,410
This wisp had an awakening.

692
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:17,790
Hallelujah.

693
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,770
Wait, isn't that a Shrek song?

694
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,630
Was it Hallelujah in Shrek?

695
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,190
Yes!

696
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,630
Oh my gosh.

697
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,650
How do I spell it?

698
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,430
Shrek Film!

699
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,110
Oh my gosh.

700
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,110
Shrek Film.

701
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:47,870
Oh my God.

702
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,590
Here we go.

703
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:24,900
The baffled king composing Hallelujah.

704
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,760
Hallelujah.

705
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,070
Wait, I can't see the lyrics if I do this.

706
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,590
Hallelujah.

707
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,030
Your faith was strong, but you needed proof.

708
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,350
You saw her bathing on the roof.

709
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:55,470
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you.

710
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,410
She tied you to a...

711
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:03,650
She cut your hair.

712
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,810
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.

713
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:21,340
This is you when you realize that you like to be decorated.

714
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,460
Hallelujah.

715
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,260
Maybe I've been here before.

716
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,120
I know this room.

717
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,940
I've walked this floor.

718
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,580
I used to live alone before I knew you.

719
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,840
I've seen your flag on the marble arch.

720
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,140
Love is not a victory march.

721
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,940
It's cold and it's all broken.

722
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,960
Hallelujah.

723
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,120
There was

724
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,640
a time you'd let me know.

725
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,980
What's really going on below.

726
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,960
But now you never show it to me.

727
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,120
Do you?

728
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,120
I moved in you.

729
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,300
The holy dove was moving too.

730
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,300
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah.

731
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,090
Is this ever a song really about you?

732
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:50,690
Maybe

733
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,100
there's a God above.

734
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,440
And all I ever learned from love.

735
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,360
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew ya.

736
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,420
And it's not a cry you can hear at night.

737
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,640
It's not somebody who's seen the light.

738
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,540
It's cold and it's all broken.

739
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,620
Hallelujah.

740
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,350
Oh my gosh.

741
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:00,790
Hallelujah.

742
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:12,790
Oh my gosh, what if we just so naturally, casually fit in all the...

743
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,130
Wait!

744
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,810
You talked about All-Star earlier.

745
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,170
Dang it.

746
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,670
I completely forgot to sing it.

747
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,630
That's the finale though.

748
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:27,450
All-Star has to be the finale, okay guys?

749
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,610
Can't just be up here.

750
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:35,250
Didn't want to interrupt the song, but one time in Vegas I got stripper's autograph and taking the party bus?

751
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:37,910
And a limo too!

752
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:39,670
But never all at once.

753
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,510
Kinki, every time you explain a story you really just live up to your name.

754
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:46,550
I'm telling you.

755
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:51,010
Shrek used to own the Hallelujah space in my brain until I saw the Donkey Kong remix.

756
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,290
Kong-Hallelujah.

757
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:56,670
Kong-Hallelujah.

758
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,630
I need to know more.

759
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,350
Oh my gosh, there's birds.

760
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:05,970
There's the castle.

761
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,230
Wow, it looks like a modern day game console.

762
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:13,470
Where is this version?

763
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,810
I can never find the right version for karaoke.

764
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,390
The one that I just played?

765
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,430
I got it from Kara-Fun.

766
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:24,910
It's one of my favorite songs and he made it funny and adorable and amazing all at once.

767
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:25,890
No!

768
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:27,650
What are you talking about?

769
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:28,570
Thank you.

770
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,530
I'll sing it properly later.

771
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,190
I'll sing it properly later when we...

772
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,830
When we are... When we are here.

773
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:43,990
When we finish cleaning.

774
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:44,930
We must clean!

775
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:45,850
We must clean.

776
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:46,990
Theacross!

777
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,730
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

778
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,200
You freak.

779
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,280
Making me sing a... First you asked me to degrade you.

780
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,800
And then you make me sing a song about sex.

781
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,880
You freak!

782
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,280
Me until learning... Finding out in real time that the song is freaky.

783
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,180
BigAnimer!

784
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,360
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

785
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,020
I feel like that's me with a lot of songs though sometimes.

786
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,920
I often like... Love songs for mostly the melody.

787
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,440
And then I'll like... Sing the song.

788
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,360
Or... I don't know.

789
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,100
Sometimes the lyrics just don't process in my brain.

790
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,620
And then I sing it and I'm like... Whoa, wait a second.

791
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,940
There's something strange about this one.

792
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,300
I don't think he made you degrade him.

793
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,400
You're right.

794
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,420
I wanted to do that.

795
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,820
Keep doing it then.

796
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,440
Stop being so freaky!

797
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,960
What's wrong with you guys?

798
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,780
Chat, you guys... Chat always gets too comfortable with the streamer, I swear.

799
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,040
You become too comfortable and you're just like... I can just ask her.

800
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:29,380
You ask as if... It's just like when you ask someone like...

801
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,240
Hey, can you go pick this up at the store for me?

802
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,420
Oh, you're going over there?

803
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,560
Can you grab this for me?

804
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,640
Oh, hey, you're streaming?

805
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,680
Can you degrade me?

806
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,220
Like it's just like... Oh, hey, while you're doing that...

807
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:48,760
Can you call me a nasty, ugly piece of shit?

808
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:49,740
Thanks!

809
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:01,580
You guys have to... Please, have more dignity.

810
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,320
Where is your dignity?

811
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,260
I say as a hypocrite.

812
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,400
Center display floor still... Oh, I see.

813
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,080
Okay, there we go.

814
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,880
Like streamer, like chat.

815
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,240
Honorless wisp.

816
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,380
My dignity is currently boneless.

817
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,820
You guys...

818
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,700
I fell asleep like right as I started it last night, but I started...

819
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,880
Not the next book, but I discovered that there is another book...

820
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,820
Of the milking farm, but from the guy's point of view.

821
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:49,500
So...

822
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,560
But I started it last night and immediately fell asleep.

823
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,140
So I have nothing to say.

824
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,360
Dignity?

825
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,440
What VTuber is that?

826
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,380
Oh god, not again.

827
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,800
What do you mean?

828
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:07,840
What do you mean?

829
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,100
You're not the one listening to it, it's me.

830
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,620
Dignity is overrated.

831
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,440
I know some people... Sometimes my friends are just like...

832
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,580
Mint, how do you handle people talking to you like this?

833
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,790
But honestly, I think it's...

834
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,360
There's something very special about someone being their true self.

835
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,620
And you know, if you're comfortable here...

836
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,960
You know, I'm not saying it's like the best thing ever, but like...

837
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,620
You know...

838
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,520
How do I put this down?

839
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,780
Wait, how do I put it down?

840
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,080
Freaky phantom.

841
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,500
Why are you guys so freaky?

842
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,200
Can I not lean it against the tree?

843
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:03,130
Wait, oh yeah, I can't lean it against the tree.

844
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:04,450
That kind of sucks.

845
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,680
Is that Kermy or Cermy?

846
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,780
Welcome to my membership!

847
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,860
Thank you!

848
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:27,330
Chat reflects the streamer.

849
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,000
Half a year abandoning my dignity.

850
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,480
Something about being cringe, something about being free.

851
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,720
If you can't handle me at my freakiest...

852
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,980
You don't deserve me at my phantomest.

853
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,540
One second, there we go.

854
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,860
Oh hey, Mint, can you compliment yourself?

855
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:06,410
What a strange request.

856
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,250
Why are you so weird?

857
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,450
Now this is real torture.

858
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:14,330
What, these things?

859
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:18,730
I'm not gonna do them right now, because I hate doing...

860
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:22,790
In between the little spokes and wheels and everything...

861
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,910
And all the little gears and everything.

862
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:25,930
So annoying!

863
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:29,550
Do it!

864
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:31,130
You can't make me!

865
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,830
You actually can't make me.

866
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:41,790
It's great watching people make their true selves, like this stream.

867
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,470
Every time Ocelot is on screen.

868
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:49,530
Yeah.

869
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,090
Six months of being hated.

870
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,030
Yippee!

871
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:55,270
Lost in the story, thanks for the 20k!

872
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:00,270
I can hear that your court of spray-a-ton has a large round table...

873
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:02,870
Where every knight has a seat to discuss the orders of the day.

874
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,490
How did Lord Farquaad get my number?

875
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,690
Duloc has a larger table with just one seat.

876
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:13,590
Mine.

877
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,770
He makes everybody sit in his lap.

878
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:20,290
He's so weird.

879
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:22,190
Bag, welcome to membership!

880
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:22,910
Thank you!

881
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:25,630
He matched you on Tinder.

882
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:28,530
Oh my gosh, a rooster!

883
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,320
Goodbye, bird.

884
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,600
Do you think there's anything under there?

885
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,860
No?

886
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,120
Okay.

887
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,500
Trash can.

888
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,460
It's complete.

889
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:48,080
Okay.

890
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,580
Yeet trash.

891
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,140
I'm in the... Hello!

892
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:00,800
Hello!

893
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,720
Alright guys, I want to do my own vandalism.

894
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,740
I want to do my own vandalism.

895
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,020
Let's see.

896
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,200
What should we do?

897
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,420
What should we write?

898
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,320
What should we do?

899
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,880
Are Shrek spoilers allowed in this stream?

900
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,840
I've only seen Shrek 1 and 2.

901
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,800
But I know some spoilers.

902
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,300
BB.

903
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,820
Why do you guys want me to write BB?

904
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:40,900
BB?

905
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:40,960
BB?

906
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,640
You should watch the Shrek musical.

907
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,940
My favorite line is, this ass of mine is asinine.

908
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,780
It's pretty good.

909
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,960
Death Stranding, baby.

910
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,360
Okay.

911
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:12,520
Ink Phantom!

912
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:13,960
Oh my gosh.

913
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,440
You sound like my cousin.

914
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,200
Thanks for the gifted!

915
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,640
Hold on.

916
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,160
Freak was here.

917
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,180
I did it.

918
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:55,940
I did it dirty.

919
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,000
You guys.

920
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,280
I was naughty.

921
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,560
Oh my gosh.

922
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,260
I'm a delinquent.

923
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:07,940
I'm a delinquent.

924
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:08,160
I'm a delinquent.

925
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,180
You did a cleanie.

926
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:17,600
Yeah.

927
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,440
Oh, Vince, you're so bad.

928
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,160
Oh my gosh.

929
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,300
Oh my gosh.

930
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,380
Was the Lorax also Dreamworks?

931
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,720
The song, How Bad Can I Be?

932
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,440
I've never seen it, so...

933
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:35,600
No?

934
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,840
What was it?

935
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,780
Was it Illumination?

936
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,640
It's Illumination?

937
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,260
I think we got the whole...

938
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:52,860
Cart?

939
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:53,840
Wait.

940
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,440
There we go.

941
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,840
I think now we have the whole cart.

942
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:00,900
I think.

943
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,260
And probably Ding Dong and Ditch when she was younger.

944
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,560
No, I...

945
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,940
I was like...

946
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,360
So...

947
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,440
Like...

948
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,320
A stupidly good kid.

949
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,280
I was like...

950
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:23,820
No...

951
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,100
I was safety...

952
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,760
I was like a safety monitor at my school.

953
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,200
And I got promoted to head safety monitor.

954
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,220
Like, I...

955
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:37,000
Was very like...

956
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,900
You know, never get in trouble, never do anything.

957
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,580
The most I did was...

958
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:45,300
Jump in ditches because I thought I could go to see Inuyasha.

959
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,580
Oh, thanks for the brain!

960
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,320
Oh, I missed the name.

961
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,460
I missed the name!

962
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,120
I'm sorry, thank you for the brain!

963
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,020
Sorry, it's...

964
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:00,760
White on white.

965
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:01,820
Stupid YouTuber.

966
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,560
It's always the most behaved ones.

967
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:08,460
Well, you know.

968
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,960
And then I discovered Newgrounds.

969
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,580
And I still was a good kid.

970
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,740
I just went on Newgrounds.

971
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,120
Played things I shouldn't have played and saw things I shouldn't have seen.

972
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,460
But I think I turned out okay.

973
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,100
Oh, Nyaru!

974
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,260
Thanks for the brain!

975
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,660
Ducky, thanks for the gift!

976
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,820
The MNF games.

977
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:45,780
Yeah.

978
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,440
Now you can just get that kind of stuff on Steam.

979
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,160
Oh my gosh, you guys.

980
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,000
I bought Orc Massage.

981
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,620
And I will play it in my free time.

982
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,720
I will not have Doki Bird calling me...

983
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,520
Less...

984
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,000
Less of a freak than her.

985
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,440
Because I hadn't played it.

986
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,100
And I have all my... Oh, what's this?

987
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,020
Information board.

988
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,680
Oh.

989
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,100
Welcome to Duloc.

990
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,100
Interact with the information stand lever.

991
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,860
Does it say poo?

992
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,060
Oh, poo.

993
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,080
Doki is just coping.

994
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,900
She's surprisingly safe compared to you.

995
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:47,840
Information...

996
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,360
Does this work?

997
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,260
Where is my song?

998
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:58,840
Oh my God!

999
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,120
Oh my God!

1000
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,200
Oh my God, even the guy in jail.

1001
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,500
Wash your... Ass.

1002
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,360
That's the only part of the song I remember.

1003
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,940
Do I have to watch the whole thing and then they'll sing to me?

1004
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,380
Oh, sorry.

1005
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:24,840
Face!

1006
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,360
I remember.

1007
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,860
I'm not making it raunchier.

1008
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,980
It's literally Shrek.

1009
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,200
They do that all on their own.

1010
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,980
They don't need my help.

1011
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,820
What parts of this... Oh my gosh, there's still unclean people.

1012
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,180
Can I get in here?

1013
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,980
Oh my gosh, I can join!

1014
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,880
Nevermind, I can't join.

1015
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:03,540
Oh, here we go.

1016
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,620
Oh my gosh, how am I supposed to clean the back of this?

1017
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,400
Puppet Sage, good.

1018
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,840
Little puppet people, you OK?

1019
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,000
Everything good?

1020
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,860
Wait, here?

1021
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,220
Oh my gosh.

1022
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:24,760
OK.

1023
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:30,980
Do you think it's better now?

1024
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,180
Let's try it.

1025
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,240
Press the button.

1026
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,780
I mean, pull the lever.

1027
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:51,030
It's the most...

1028
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:53,850
Disappointing thing.

1029
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:56,810
That's me right now.

1030
00:59:58,770 --> 00:59:59,810
No way!

1031
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:01,110
It has to be more clean?

1032
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:02,810
Will it actually sing it though?

1033
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:04,090
You sure?

1034
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:05,130
OK.

1035
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,730
More clean, more clean.

1036
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:07,950
More clean.

1037
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:09,730
We'll get the whole thing, we'll get the whole thing.

1038
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,330
Even the ground around it.

1039
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:15,110
It'll be so clean you can lick it.

1040
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:17,490
You can eat off of it.

1041
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:18,790
It's perfect.

1042
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:19,770
Chai never lies.

1043
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:22,510
This is the most important part.

1044
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:25,110
You guys, if you're lying...

1045
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:28,130
I might cry for real, OK?

1046
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:30,110
So you're telling the truth, right?

1047
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:31,430
It'll play the song?

1048
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,630
What's that mean?

1049
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,790
It's a yes or no question.

1050
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:44,170
OK.

1051
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:50,010
If you guys are lying, I'm gonna have to sing Hallelujah again, maybe.

1052
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:51,850
Because it's supposed to be a sad song.

1053
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,350
What other Shrek songs are there?

1054
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:59,210
I meant to look this up before stream, and I got...

1055
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:01,470
I was busy dealing with some stuff.

1056
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:05,610
Oh, I'm sorry about there not being a schedule up yet for this week.

1057
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:10,630
Hopefully tonight, I'm waiting on confirmation for stuff this weekend.

1058
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:16,370
Accidentally in love.

1059
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:18,670
I know.

1060
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:20,290
And then I saw her face.

1061
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,170
I'm a believer.

1062
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:25,970
Not a trace.

1063
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:32,870
I'm in love.

1064
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,170
YMCA?

1065
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:41,830
Is that in Shrek?

1066
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:49,970
Were you the one who messaged Doki and asked her if she was having fun while she was playing Orc Massage?

1067
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:50,810
No!

1068
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:57,830
I don't think I've ever seen her... I don't think I...

1069
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:01,190
I've seen her with her game...

1070
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:02,030
Like...

1071
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:05,210
Whatever's on Discord, you know?

1072
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:07,830
But mine are on, so if I'm playing it...

1073
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:10,950
Maybe I'll get some messages.

1074
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:11,390
We'll see.

1075
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:20,030
It looks so clean!

1076
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:26,650
Oh my god, my eyes.

1077
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:28,970
Speedy fire!

1078
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:30,230
Thanks for 6 months!

1079
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:38,850
And now, the Orc Massage also has mermaid girls in case you're interested, so...

1080
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:41,450
There's more.

1081
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,110
Information...

1082
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:48,450
It looks 100%?

1083
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:51,010
Oh wait.

1084
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:55,470
Some panels are not 100%?

1085
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:00,570
Some panels are still dirty.

1086
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:07,750
Will you give us a video essay?

1087
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:09,690
It's a lot of work.

1088
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,350
Can't I just tell you about it?

1089
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:13,670
Oh wait, maybe it's done.

1090
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:20,230
We need...we need like a...

1091
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,410
We need this.

1092
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:32,890
Oh there's a ladder right there.

1093
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:37,630
Why can't I put it against it though?

1094
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:41,690
It denies me my right!

1095
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:47,570
Orc Massage is alright, but it hasn't had an update in over a year.

1096
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:49,610
I hope the devs haven't...Wait, but...

1097
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:51,130
It said there were mermaids now.

1098
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:52,230
Is that not a recent update?

1099
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,800
There we go.

1100
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:01,580
Okay.

1101
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:02,760
Easy.

1102
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,000
Easy now.

1103
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,180
Easy now.

1104
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,220
We are such professionals.

1105
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:09,460
We are such professionals.

1106
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,060
Easy now.

1107
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:12,860
Easy now.

1108
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,220
Easy now.

1109
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,180
It's frequent enough that it's not considered abandoned.

1110
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:23,820
Oh wait, maybe we are good now.

1111
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,360
I think so.

1112
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:34,120
Okay, let's try it one more time.

1113
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,360
Did I miss?

1114
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,460
Is every little puppet clean?

1115
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:46,660
Clean!

1116
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,420
Huh?

1117
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,660
I'm not crying yet!

1118
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,180
I'm not crying yet!

1119
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:03,000
It's...my eyes are just a little glassy.

1120
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:06,740
Because I'm so glassy.

1121
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,280
Woooo!

1122
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:10,840
On the grass, find your shoes, wipe your face!

1123
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,840
Duloc is...Duloc is the perfect place!

1124
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,400
Oh my God, it took a picture of us even.

1125
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,680
Not rigged.

1126
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,040
Yippee!

1127
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:36,210
I knew it would play, you guys!

1128
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:39,310
Gosh, you scared me for a second.

1129
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:41,770
I thought you had lied to me or something.

1130
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,130
But you would never...

1131
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:47,590
You would never do that to me.

1132
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:03,860
You would never do that to me.

1133
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:19,390
We've never lied once.

1134
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:19,930
I know!

1135
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:25,850
Yeah, we would never lie to you or bully you.

1136
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,510
You'd never bully me.

1137
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:33,170
I don't even think I bully you.

1138
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:35,790
I have the power here.

1139
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:39,030
I don't think you could even bully me.

1140
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:40,650
I have the power here.

1141
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,970
It's my stream.

1142
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:45,410
I can do whatever I want.

1143
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:47,730
I can blip you guys on your heads.

1144
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:54,870
I can make you guys literally have all the blood rush to your heads right now.

1145
01:08:56,590 --> 01:09:00,130
You can't do that to me because I...

1146
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:01,370
am a ghost.

1147
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:02,990
And I'm filled with ectoplasm.

1148
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,540
You're not gonna get me with that, Murphy.

1149
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:12,800
I'm stronger.

1150
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,120
Let's just bait.

1151
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:16,340
Let's just bait.

1152
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,240
Let's just bait.

1153
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,880
Calling me cute is the least...

1154
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,020
Is the bait is the least...

1155
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:24,200
Is the most...

1156
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,120
I mean, it's the...

1157
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,940
It's the one that is the most lazy.

1158
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:38,750
You literally begged for mercy yesterday.

1159
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:42,490
During the Vulcan fight, you're not Vulcan.

1160
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:47,210
You're not Vulcan.

1161
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:50,670
Wait, were you self-inserting?

1162
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:52,210
Were you like, I'm Vulcan, so...

1163
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:54,070
She was talking to me.

1164
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:58,510
It's not him, it should've been me.

1165
01:09:58,750 --> 01:09:59,750
Hi, I'm Vulcan.

1166
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,670
No, you're Tonkin.

1167
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:03,730
You're so cute.

1168
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:04,090
No!

1169
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,100
No!

1170
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:12,600
Lazy attempt.

1171
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,200
Try some new material.

1172
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,140
I'm sick of hearing that one.

1173
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,000
Cute.

1174
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:21,360
No!

1175
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:27,320
Think anybody lives here?

1176
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:29,620
I live here.

1177
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,080
Welcome to my home.

1178
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,740
Vulcan is nuts.

1179
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,580
What does that mean?

1180
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,880
Calling her cute works, she was clearly flustered.

1181
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:45,960
No, I wasn't!

1182
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:51,420
I just don't know how to say words.

1183
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:55,480
Adorkable.

1184
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,180
Oh no, you're just reminding me of Mothman now.

1185
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:01,600
Adorable even.

1186
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:02,520
No, stop.

1187
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,660
When I hear adorable right now, I'm thinking of Mothman.

1188
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:06,440
Please.

1189
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:15,870
If you want, I'll draw a demonstration of his folds.

1190
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:20,330
Chuu, thank you.

1191
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:22,390
Minto is the cutest.

1192
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:22,770
Stop!

1193
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:26,590
You're talented and a gamer and you sing so, so great.

1194
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:27,190
Stop!

1195
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:33,270
I'll have you know that I was a chat all along.

1196
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:37,030
Clicks in the morning.

1197
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:38,670
No!

1198
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:41,630
Minto, adorable.

1199
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:42,090
Stop.

1200
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,230
You're pretty good.

1201
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:47,330
See, that's not even...

1202
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:49,270
That's not bullying.

1203
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,010
But it makes my brain unwell.

1204
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:55,290
Wait, what's happening here?

1205
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:56,850
There we go.

1206
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,070
It makes my brain unwell.

1207
01:12:00,710 --> 01:12:02,950
Okay, so let me find a dirty wall.

1208
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:05,350
Okay, so Mothman...

1209
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:06,970
He's an innie.

1210
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:10,410
This is his body.

1211
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:13,410
He's got little legs.

1212
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:16,430
Actually, I don't know what his legs are like.

1213
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,610
Because he doesn't wear... He can't wear pants.

1214
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:20,510
Okay?

1215
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:23,250
And he...

1216
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:27,970
I don't know how it works though.

1217
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:29,970
He's just got like a little...

1218
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:34,070
And it's vacuum sealed.

1219
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:38,450
He's pantsless.

1220
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:40,890
But she makes him wear pants.

1221
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,590
She's like, you're gonna wear pants right now.

1222
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:45,750
She's like, you gotta wear pants.

1223
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:47,330
Right now.

1224
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,130
We're putting these pants on you right now.

1225
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:51,210
Oh my gosh.

1226
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:52,770
It's got a little hole.

1227
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:57,790
And he's also covered in moth dust.

1228
01:12:58,330 --> 01:12:59,590
Which gets all over him.

1229
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,090
You're funny, charming... Stop!

1230
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:04,290
What is this?

1231
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:06,970
This is not a compliment hour!

1232
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,300
Going back to the side.

1233
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,160
We'll meet the mothman later.

1234
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,640
You challenged us.

1235
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:21,760
I didn't challenge anything!

1236
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,320
You have no power.

1237
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,280
You have no power.

1238
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:41,230
But you're so small.

1239
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:42,930
Praise her until she's homeless.

1240
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:48,870
Watching your streams helps me get back into writing and painting.

1241
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:49,490
Minis!

1242
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:51,350
Thank you for making such a funny and entertaining stream.

1243
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:51,830
You're a great singer.

1244
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:53,930
Thank you!

1245
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:57,210
Minis.

1246
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:00,390
Are they hotter than Mothra?

1247
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:01,570
I don't think so.

1248
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:05,310
I don't think so.

1249
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:10,290
Gosh, I just can't get over how much I hated the characters in that book though.

1250
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:13,230
Get cherished, ghost freak.

1251
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:17,460
No, please.

1252
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,140
Mint is cute.

1253
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:20,200
Why?

1254
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,150
That's how you know.

1255
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:36,550
She means business.

1256
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:42,610
That's how you know.

1257
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:44,530
She means business.

1258
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:46,630
Even the no is angry.

1259
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:47,890
Even the no.

1260
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:51,790
Even the no has to tell you no.

1261
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:06,070
Thank you for being here with us.

1262
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:07,650
You're okay, I guess.

1263
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:09,070
Yeah, whatever.

1264
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:14,470
Being...

1265
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:17,110
Why are you guys...

1266
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:21,610
Why are you guys so...

1267
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:22,730
Wholesome sometimes.

1268
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:25,530
It's not very becoming.

1269
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:28,170
No more...

1270
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:30,550
I ban wholesomeness from this chat.

1271
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:32,750
I ban it, I ban it.

1272
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,540
It's a balancing act.

1273
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,700
You sure?

1274
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:44,720
You sure?

1275
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:46,920
Yeah, I'm positive.

1276
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:49,720
Oh my god, it looks like we're in the circus.

1277
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:50,980
Do you feel at home?

1278
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:07,920
Thank you!

1279
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,960
Thank you so much!

1280
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,040
Thanks for coming to the meet and greet too, Cornelius.

1281
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:15,540
Oh my god.

1282
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,770
Can I leave this city?

1283
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:38,270
It's making you guys weird.

1284
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:41,110
Can I get out of here?

1285
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:43,330
It's making you guys strange.

1286
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:45,810
It's the air or something.

1287
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:48,130
What's happening?

1288
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:55,050
I couldn't find another song.

1289
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:56,970
I had this in my...

1290
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:58,890
In my, like, immediate folder.

1291
01:16:59,090 --> 01:16:59,910
So I just picked it.

1292
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:02,530
I was like, oh, you know, maybe people will...

1293
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:04,390
Watch this and want to, like, chill out...

1294
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:05,670
After work or something today.

1295
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:06,950
So, I don't know.

1296
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:10,170
And it's just kind of matched the vibes of a power wash sim.

1297
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:11,450
Because it's kind of a chill, you know.

1298
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:14,430
Thank you for playing this.

1299
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:15,550
Cleansing my eyes from Doki.

1300
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:17,590
Just doing the bare minimum and leaving dirt everywhere.

1301
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:19,130
Give me an aneurysm.

1302
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:19,950
lol

1303
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:26,930
I don't want to know what her...

1304
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:29,130
What her room looks like.

1305
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:33,430
Aisle sidewalk, there's more?

1306
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:34,490
Oh my gosh.

1307
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:35,850
Oh wait.

1308
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:37,950
Okay, this is the same.

1309
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:45,770
But my room is kind of a mess right now too.

1310
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,130
Because I've been moving stuff around.

1311
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:47,890
Oh my gosh.

1312
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:49,930
Today I got a sticker notebook.

1313
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:51,570
Like a sticker binder.

1314
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:53,150
Kind of.

1315
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:56,450
And...

1316
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:58,990
I was able to put most of my stickers in.

1317
01:17:59,030 --> 01:17:59,950
Some of them didn't fit.

1318
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:00,830
So I'm really sad.

1319
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,330
But I finally got one.

1320
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:07,130
For all my, like...

1321
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:09,130
Metal gear sticker sheets.

1322
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:10,330
That I've been buying recently.

1323
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:13,750
What are you, 10?

1324
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:14,750
10, what do you mean?

1325
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:16,150
There's like...

1326
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,050
What are you talking about?

1327
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:19,870
People sell Vtuber stickers all the time.

1328
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:22,410
They sell like...

1329
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:25,510
Stickers for video games and stuff.

1330
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:26,830
Like...

1331
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:27,750
I have so many.

1332
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:30,210
I have stickers of my favorite idols.

1333
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:32,110
I have so many stickers.

1334
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:34,070
And I don't want to just put them...

1335
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:36,610
And not be able to use them anymore afterwards.

1336
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:36,690
It hurts!

1337
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,020
Minto is super cute.

1338
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:44,480
Stop!

1339
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,220
Your streams help me with life.

1340
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,360
Why are you guys so...

1341
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,360
Why are you guys so...

1342
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,520
Wholesome right now.

1343
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:03,960
It's always nice to hear your voice.

1344
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,120
And to know you're doing well.

1345
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,060
Am I doing well?

1346
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:09,420
I don't think so.

1347
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,940
You guys, I'm brain rotted.

1348
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,360
Well is...

1349
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,430
It's like...

1350
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:19,310
You're doing...

1351
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,080
Quote-unquote well.

1352
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,020
Doing quote-unquote well.

1353
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,720
How do you even do the bare minimum in this game?

1354
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,160
Like, get it until it recharges?

1355
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,400
Or not recharge...

1356
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,020
Does the...

1357
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,180
Mothman!

1358
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,140
He had big ol' long arms.

1359
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,460
Oh my gosh, it was so funny too.

1360
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,640
Because sometimes she'd be like...

1361
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,460
And he had really long fingers.

1362
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:52,860
She made a point of saying that.

1363
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,020
She would be like, aren't you...

1364
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:58,180
Aren't you gonna kidnap me from a bridge or something?

1365
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,740
And he's like, that's just an urban legend.

1366
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:02,740
I'm like...

1367
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:07,320
What even is life if you don't have things you like too much?

1368
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,440
True!

1369
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,420
I worry sometimes that like...

1370
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:15,400
You know...

1371
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,320
The day that you like...

1372
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,480
Whenever you stop watching Vtubers...

1373
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,860
You become uninterested in Vtubers...

1374
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:25,540
That like, you regret having all...

1375
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:27,480
If you bought Vtuber merch or whatever...

1376
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,740
You regret...

1377
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:31,800
Not liking it or you're just like...

1378
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,540
Oh man, like...

1379
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,620
I donated so much money to...

1380
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,300
To those streamer girls.

1381
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,860
I should've saved it for something else.

1382
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:40,300
I regret not...

1383
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:41,560
I regret it.

1384
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,300
I think about that...

1385
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,100
Somewhat often.

1386
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,200
I feel like I'm like...

1387
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,480
Man, I have to make it...

1388
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,220
Yee-oh!

1389
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:56,820
The souvenir shoppy!

1390
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:56,920
The souvenir shoppy!

1391
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:00,060
I feel like I'm like...

1392
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,520
I hope that I can make...

1393
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,820
You know, even if it's just like a short time...

1394
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,080
I hope I can like...

1395
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,680
Make it worth it, you know?

1396
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:09,440
And you're just like...

1397
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,980
Then later on you're not like...

1398
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,680
Oh my gosh, I have to get rid of all this merchandise...

1399
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,380
What do I do?

1400
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,200
What do I do?

1401
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,440
Like give it to a...

1402
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,520
Donate it to a thrift store?

1403
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,460
Nobody wants it?

1404
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:23,060
lol

1405
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:26,520
Garble!

1406
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,020
Oh, Binto is not only cute...

1407
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,060
But seeing how hard she always works is genuinely inspiring.

1408
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:33,500
Stop!

1409
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,400
19 year old hag love.

1410
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:42,520
I'll eat the merch.

1411
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:44,260
Okay, that's a good idea actually.

1412
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:46,780
I used to be a brony...

1413
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:48,900
So I cast aside all my regrets long ago.

1414
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:49,740
Oh my gosh.

1415
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:51,080
I thought I was gonna say...

1416
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,820
I cast aside all my merch long ago.

1417
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:53,960
Never regret.

1418
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,390
What do you do with all your...

1419
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:05,890
I don't regret my MLP merch.

1420
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:09,070
Oh my gosh, we have multiple bronies.

1421
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:11,970
Brony to Vtuber pipeline reel?

1422
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:18,750
I had a pony song stuck in my head the other day.

1423
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:21,310
It was the one...

1424
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:22,670
Um...

1425
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:23,610
Oh my gosh.

1426
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:26,830
It was when that girl was gonna get married...

1427
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:29,350
But the chrysalis queen took over her body or whatever.

1428
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:31,890
And they had like that little duet.

1429
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:33,050
And it's like...

1430
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:35,350
It goes way harder than it should've.

1431
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:40,230
This day is going to be perfect.

1432
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:43,050
The one that I dreamed.

1433
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:45,010
The dream since I was small.

1434
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:46,110
That one!

1435
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,790
Vtubers have helped me more than real people at times.

1436
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:54,710
With the sheer joy they display playing games and hanging out with friends.

1437
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:59,290
And hopefully you can also make a lot of friends.

1438
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:01,210
Through...

1439
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:01,670
You know.

1440
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:03,310
What's this one?

1441
01:23:03,530 --> 01:23:04,150
Oh my gosh.

1442
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:07,790
This shop is probably like the ye olde freak shop.

1443
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:09,750
Bread.

1444
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:19,750
Someone who has spent money on merch in the past and brings back good memories.

1445
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:22,070
Close enough.

1446
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:23,230
Yeah, close enough.

1447
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:24,090
I'll take it.

1448
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:28,070
Ye olde freaky bread shop.

1449
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:40,870
Even when I fall out of a series I try to keep like...

1450
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:42,570
One thing, you know?

1451
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:43,970
Cause I'm...

1452
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:46,070
Say there's an anime.

1453
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:48,350
Anime seasons end.

1454
01:23:48,530 --> 01:23:49,670
So it's just like...

1455
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:53,370
There's some anime that like...

1456
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:54,970
I will...

1457
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:58,710
Forever just be ranting and raving about that series.

1458
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:08,830
But if there's one that I just liked and I bought a couple things from it If I don't like it so much anymore I'll like usually...

1459
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:15,050
I have actually a bag of stuff that I have to bring to Japan with me next time to sell at Mandarake.

1460
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,230
But like I'll...

1461
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:19,490
I'll try to keep at least one thing.

1462
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:20,630
Because I'm like...

1463
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:23,570
The most things that I like the most.

1464
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:24,330
Because I'll be like...

1465
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:26,170
You know, this series once...

1466
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:28,070
You know, I liked it enough to...

1467
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:29,710
Buy stuff, you know?

1468
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:31,590
So...

1469
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:33,110
Mandrake, let's go.

1470
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:37,390
Yeah...

1471
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:39,850
I had to watch MLP with my Wii sister.

1472
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:41,990
It was a decent show and opinion compared to...

1473
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:42,390
It is!

1474
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:44,010
It's actually decent, right?

1475
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:47,190
Why not make a lot of enemies?

1476
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:48,610
Into friends.

1477
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:52,790
I expected better of you.

1478
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:54,810
It's enemies to lovers.

1479
01:24:58,190 --> 01:24:59,450
Enemies to friends?

1480
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:00,710
I don't want it.

1481
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:01,970
Oh, goodbye Mothman.

1482
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:04,550
Enemy series is different from Vtubers?

1483
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:05,190
Like this way?

1484
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:08,190
Have you ever regretted or gotten rid of your idol merch?

1485
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:10,430
No.

1486
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:14,030
No.

1487
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:16,730
Oh, well...

1488
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:16,970
Okay.

1489
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:19,610
Once.

1490
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:22,030
I'm gonna be very...

1491
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:23,970
Bare in my mint coffee shop.

1492
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:27,510
And...

1493
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:29,930
It was an idol that...

1494
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:31,890
She was my...

1495
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:33,870
First ever Kamiyoshi, actually.

1496
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:37,190
And I...

1497
01:25:37,190 --> 01:25:38,010
Loved her.

1498
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:40,330
I loved her so much.

1499
01:25:41,490 --> 01:25:42,530
Oh my gosh.

1500
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:44,970
My first ever Kamiyoshi.

1501
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:46,750
That's a big deal, right?

1502
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,750
And then...

1503
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:51,410
Some like...

1504
01:25:51,410 --> 01:25:53,070
Not so good stuff...

1505
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:53,890
Came out about her.

1506
01:25:54,810 --> 01:25:56,110
In the news.

1507
01:25:57,810 --> 01:25:59,030
And I was like...

1508
01:25:59,030 --> 01:25:59,890
Really...

1509
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:02,010
Seeing her now makes me so upset.

1510
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:04,910
You know?

1511
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:06,590
So I'm just like...

1512
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:08,790
Like her image...

1513
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:09,690
Was ruined.

1514
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:12,630
So that...

1515
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,690
But I feel like that's a really...

1516
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:17,270
That's like a specific case, right?

1517
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:18,690
Like, you know...

1518
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:23,030
That's like...

1519
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:24,690
That's like a specific...

1520
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:25,690
Thing.

1521
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:27,790
But anyone else...

1522
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:28,650
Of course not.

1523
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:30,330
I've never even...

1524
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:32,710
Even my Oshis that have all graduated and stuff...

1525
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:36,690
Like ten years ago, I've never gotten rid of their stuff.

1526
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:40,630
They're streamers I've watched since childhood.

1527
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:42,750
Oh my gosh, Shawn, you're a baby.

1528
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:44,390
Little baby.

1529
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:51,030
Specific and reasonable.

1530
01:26:51,730 --> 01:26:52,610
Yeah, right?

1531
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:53,490
Like, it's different.

1532
01:26:56,770 --> 01:26:57,290
But...

1533
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:59,970
For other idols and everything...

1534
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:00,250
No.

1535
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:05,010
So, okay, I get it.

1536
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:05,750
But I don't know.

1537
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:07,750
I feel like...

1538
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:09,770
Sometimes I'm just like, you know...

1539
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:11,850
Not everyone thinks with the same brain as me.

1540
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:15,010
So for me, I'm just like, I could never...

1541
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:16,370
My Oshi is my Oshi.

1542
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:18,570
But I don't know if you think that way, right?

1543
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:19,350
I don't know.

1544
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:20,550
I don't know!

1545
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:24,190
Did you see the lilac art with...

1546
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:25,810
Ofuda instead of the Sankakukin?

1547
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:28,210
Can that be canon?

1548
01:27:31,650 --> 01:27:33,890
This has done permanent damage.

1549
01:27:34,230 --> 01:27:35,850
I feel like I get more of...

1550
01:27:36,370 --> 01:27:40,030
Fan art of Goth Minto than...

1551
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:42,110
Than anything else!

1552
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:52,230
Permanent damage to the Wisp community.

1553
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:55,410
We have to have different mint flavors, right?

1554
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:56,850
Since I'm...

1555
01:27:56,850 --> 01:28:00,290
Since I'm mint green, usually...

1556
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:03,750
Then if I'm purple...

1557
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,990
I can be lilac.

1558
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:07,570
What other things?

1559
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:09,730
Maybe blue could be like...

1560
01:28:09,730 --> 01:28:10,510
Aqua or something.

1561
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:19,500
And then red can be like...

1562
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:19,800
Chili.

1563
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:24,040
Yellow can be...

1564
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,880
Orange can be pumpkin.

1565
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,440
We need one called Spearmint.

1566
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:37,200
Why?

1567
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:42,290
Why?

1568
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:43,190
Let's skip yellow.

1569
01:28:43,950 --> 01:28:44,430
Why?

1570
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:45,470
I can put banana.

1571
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:47,210
Banana, banana.

1572
01:28:49,610 --> 01:28:50,690
What's wrong with yellow?

1573
01:28:50,770 --> 01:28:51,510
What do you have against yellow?

1574
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:56,230
Spearmint is just mint with a knife.

1575
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:58,470
So true.

1576
01:28:59,490 --> 01:28:59,790
Lemon?

1577
01:29:00,030 --> 01:29:01,990
Oh my gosh, wait, I can be lemon with yellow?

1578
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:03,530
Yeah, lemon.

1579
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,170
What other colors are there?

1580
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:12,870
Pink?

1581
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:13,710
What would pink be?

1582
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,260
I'm a new fan...

1583
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:24,980
But I hear a lot of people talking about chili.

1584
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:28,920
Chili, eh?

1585
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:31,660
Chili...

1586
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:34,300
Chili came out one time.

1587
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,480
Actually, two times.

1588
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,560
One time publicly on Twitter.

1589
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:41,540
Mojito mint.

1590
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,120
I'm not a flavor mint.

1591
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:47,000
I have some Brazilian mint in the future.

1592
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:48,000
What do you mean in the future?

1593
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:58,740
If you can get enough colors, you can make super sentai mint- That sounds awesome!

1594
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:00,440
Chili, my kamiyoshi.

1595
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:01,020
I miss her.

1596
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,560
What the hell, Lily?

1597
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:07,100
I'm right here.

1598
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:09,100
I'm right here.

1599
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,540
No, chili came out for...

1600
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:12,760
I think it was April Fool's.

1601
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,240
She said some bad words.

1602
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:18,900
She said some...

1603
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,240
She was not very polite.

1604
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:23,320
She said some...

1605
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,060
Some horrible things.

1606
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:27,980
If you think I hate you...

1607
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:30,840
You say this already.

1608
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:32,460
Bring her back!

1609
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,560
Mint is cute, but lilac is hot.

1610
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:39,980
So it compliments...

1611
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:48,300
Yeah.

1612
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,980
She has no sex appeal, but lilac...

1613
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:55,880
That

1614
01:30:58,980 --> 01:30:59,620
girl...

1615
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:05,580
She's making me want to act up.

1616
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:06,340
Mint?

1617
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:06,900
Who?

1618
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,200
Who's that?

1619
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:14,640
She's gone.

1620
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:15,840
Yeah, I get it.

1621
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,520
You guys are so simple.

1622
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,560
You guys are so simple.

1623
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,540
I'm not even reading that.

1624
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:42,680
I don't even want to read it.

1625
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,320
Wait, can we go on the roof?

1626
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,000
Wait, do you think Shrek is back here?

1627
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,720
Oh no, there's an invisible wall.

1628
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:53,320
They're keeping us from him.

1629
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:57,680
Read it!

1630
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:58,820
Please read it.

1631
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:05,900
Why?

1632
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:07,260
Read it.

1633
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:07,900
No!

1634
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,500
I don't even want to read it.

1635
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,220
I don't even know.

1636
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:18,580
It's cringe in the best way.

1637
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:21,240
Read it, coward!

1638
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:26,760
Read it with a British accent.

1639
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,480
Okay, that might be the only way I get it.

1640
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:29,220
Read it, coward.

1641
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:31,380
Don't give up the satisfaction.

1642
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:53,640
Made lilac.

1643
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:56,720
I am...

1644
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,700
I offer thee this pink super...

1645
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:07,700
Pink like...

1646
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:09,140
The highlights in your hair.

1647
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,360
Okay, first of all, you're...

1648
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:13,100
Colorblind.

1649
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,720
And like the love in my kokoro.

1650
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:18,200
Don't tell Mitt.

1651
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:23,660
Wait, oh gosh.

1652
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,300
Okay, there we go.

1653
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,400
How can you say...

1654
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:29,680
Like the highlights in my hair...

1655
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,480
When I'm literally lilac?

1656
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,360
There's no out of...

1657
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,360
There's no pink!

1658
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:39,560
Plus two.

1659
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:42,140
Stop it.

1660
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:43,920
I think that means a good thing.

1661
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,360
Don't stop, don't give him the satisfaction.

1662
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:51,600
Those are some big highlights.

1663
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:54,980
That's like your balls.

1664
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:56,560
Those are some...

1665
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,860
You have a lot of...

1666
01:33:58,860 --> 01:33:59,320
You know?

1667
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:03,560
I'm so tired.

1668
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:07,360
I can't wait for the day when I can just...

1669
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,060
Leave the internet and have nobody...

1670
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:09,920
Perceive me anymore.

1671
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:15,880
I can't wait for this day.

1672
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:20,220
Okay, turquoise.

1673
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:24,940
Maybe one day.

1674
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:27,780
Okay.

1675
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:30,900
How long have I been...

1676
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,720
Cleaning this place?

1677
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:33,440
An hour and a half, okay.

1678
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:41,790
None of us can escape.

1679
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:43,490
You're here forever.

1680
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:44,790
Why?

1681
01:34:46,130 --> 01:34:47,750
It's such like a...

1682
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:50,230
Perfect line, but they...

1683
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,530
I would hate to live here.

1684
01:34:52,670 --> 01:34:54,130
Then your neighbor is just like...

1685
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:57,630
She hates us for sure.

1686
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:00,890
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

1687
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:03,730
Isn't this what you wanted?

1688
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:07,490
What's the next area?

1689
01:35:07,710 --> 01:35:09,550
Is the next area the swamp?

1690
01:35:10,150 --> 01:35:10,930
Please say yes.

1691
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:13,430
Wait, actually...

1692
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:14,170
I'm trying to remember.

1693
01:35:14,830 --> 01:35:17,890
With Spongebob, we first had...

1694
01:35:18,790 --> 01:35:20,130
We had like...

1695
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:22,170
The crab...

1696
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:24,050
No, not the crabby patty.

1697
01:35:24,270 --> 01:35:25,470
Or, not, uh, Krusty Krab.

1698
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:28,350
No, it's not!

1699
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:30,930
Swamp is third?

1700
01:35:31,570 --> 01:35:33,650
Wait, don't tell me what the second one is.

1701
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:37,070
Don't tell me what the second one is.

1702
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:39,750
Welcome to my bishopancule!

1703
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:44,660
I can't reach.

1704
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:51,020
Oh, this area sucks.

1705
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:52,700
Can I...

1706
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:55,340
Wood cleaner?

1707
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:55,960
Stone cleaner?

1708
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:56,740
Multipurpose?

1709
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:57,700
Is this a multipurpose?

1710
01:35:58,340 --> 01:35:59,180
This is stone.

1711
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:04,460
Wait, hold on.

1712
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:05,960
There we go.

1713
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:09,600
Never forget the clam bucket.

1714
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:14,280
Stone.

1715
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:17,560
Oh my gosh, it's working.

1716
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:18,940
Wait, what's this?

1717
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:19,480
Stone!

1718
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,860
Wait, did I...

1719
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:25,680
I put it on, right?

1720
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,320
No, oh.

1721
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:31,440
Nevermind.

1722
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:34,960
Let me, let me use it.

1723
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:38,900
Why won't it let me use it?

1724
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:42,220
Why won't it let me buy anything?

1725
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:45,180
Why is it so cruel?

1726
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:49,140
It's a different nozzle.

1727
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:54,560
Is the color swapped because you're trying to match your Kamiyoshi this Halloween?

1728
01:36:55,860 --> 01:37:01,220
Oh, I just felt like being a little goth, you know.

1729
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:03,960
I'm back!

1730
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:04,820
Did you miss me?

1731
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:11,520
Don't I look so refreshing after seeing a color swap palette?

1732
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:13,180
You're just like, wow.

1733
01:37:13,660 --> 01:37:17,340
Seeing this bright, refreshing mint is just so...

1734
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:18,960
It's healing for my soul.

1735
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:21,660
Don't you just think that?

1736
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:25,240
Who are you?

1737
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:26,400
Oh, hey, mint.

1738
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:29,320
Where's Lilac?

1739
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:48,160
It's like when you have a game and a fighting game character and there's a...

1740
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:50,200
There's a palette swap.

1741
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:52,740
Isn't that so exciting?

1742
01:37:54,020 --> 01:38:02,740
You're just like, oh, I like the color swap, the palette swap, but of course the original is my favorite.

1743
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:08,740
Right?

1744
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:18,480
The original just suits it the best.

1745
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:22,140
Mint is healing for my soul always.

1746
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:30,940
I mod my color palette.

1747
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,780
Waiting for the made lemon DLC.

1748
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:42,860
One day I'll have the whole rainbow, I'll show you guys, okay?

1749
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:49,890
Just a little bit more.

1750
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:56,770
Mods, ban that roaming tuna guy.

1751
01:38:59,390 --> 01:39:01,330
Mods, get his ass.

1752
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:06,230
Who are you?

1753
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:12,140
That's mean.

1754
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:24,020
Lilac is my Yoshi, but also so is the mint phantom.

1755
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:27,360
Right?

1756
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,700
Guys, don't forget about me.

1757
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,160
Don't forget about me.

1758
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:39,440
You're gonna make me cry again.

1759
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:47,910
What if there's like someone looking through the window?

1760
01:39:48,610 --> 01:39:51,930
They were horrified that we were like...

1761
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:54,850
Looking through their window.

1762
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:00,230
Gosh, I'm getting mothman flashbacks again.

1763
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:06,470
Waiting for the phantom sentai team.

1764
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:11,270
The sun.

1765
01:40:15,370 --> 01:40:16,310
Open up.

1766
01:40:16,430 --> 01:40:17,170
Click, click, click.

1767
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:22,150
Oh my gosh, there's a sexy lady in here.

1768
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,060
Click, clack.

1769
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,000
Chirp, chirp.

1770
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:33,600
I don't know why she made the mothman chirp.

1771
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:37,860
I know he's got wings and stuff, but he's not a bird.

1772
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,200
Moths don't chirp.

1773
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:45,980
I found the author's Twitter last night.

1774
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:48,240
That lady is just freaky.

1775
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:52,280
She's so freaky.

1776
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:53,780
She has a Patreon even.

1777
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:57,920
And like one of the Patreon tiers is like...

1778
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:01,280
A milker at the milk farm or something.

1779
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:04,700
Certified freak.

1780
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:06,580
She had a tweet that said that.

1781
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:07,840
She was like, certified freak.

1782
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:09,440
Seven days a week.

1783
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:17,940
You could be a milker in her...

1784
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:19,400
Actually, that's one of the tiers.

1785
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,780
Is you can be a character.

1786
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:26,540
You can be...

1787
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:28,080
A character.

1788
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:37,740
Do I rewatch Mirai Nikki or another?

1789
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:42,720
I like the opening for Mirai Nikki so much.

1790
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:51,320
It was like you're an insert character next to some other character whose name I didn't recognize.

1791
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:53,180
And I was like, what if that character sucks?

1792
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:58,290
Please do it.

1793
01:41:58,430 --> 01:42:01,230
If I do it, you guys have to read the book.

1794
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:04,810
If I do it... Hold on, let me see.

1795
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:06,450
What was her name?

1796
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:11,510
Cambrick Creek.

1797
01:42:11,510 --> 01:42:14,330
O.C.M.

1798
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:17,890
Nacosta.

1799
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:19,850
Patreon.

1800
01:42:24,610 --> 01:42:25,390
Let's see.

1801
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:30,370
Sorry Mint, I can't read.

1802
01:42:30,590 --> 01:42:31,430
I can't read!

1803
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:32,370
You can, you can!

1804
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:37,730
So, for $10 a month you can be a milking assistant at the morning glory farm.

1805
01:42:38,350 --> 01:42:39,630
This is the next book.

1806
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:44,430
The next tier is intake at Moonblooded Breeding Clinic.

1807
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:47,990
That's the one I told you about if you listened during the Metal Gear stream.

1808
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:49,710
It's about werewolves.

1809
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:54,050
And then for $25 a month you can be Elvish Country Club.

1810
01:42:54,150 --> 01:42:55,170
I don't know what that one is.

1811
01:42:55,490 --> 01:42:57,170
It's $50 a month.

1812
01:42:59,070 --> 01:43:01,050
You can be the autumn consort.

1813
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:07,070
It says I'll make you a seasonal guest star alongside Tate.

1814
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:09,430
In every Cambrick Creek story.

1815
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:10,730
I don't know who Tate is.

1816
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:15,010
And you get...

1817
01:43:15,010 --> 01:43:21,170
You get a premium swag book box.

1818
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:26,890
Signed physical copy of a published work.

1819
01:43:26,890 --> 01:43:29,810
I don't want this.

1820
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:33,510
I don't want this.

1821
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:35,990
Early access ebook.

1822
01:43:36,450 --> 01:43:37,710
The good stuff.

1823
01:43:38,090 --> 01:43:39,010
I don't know what that means.

1824
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:42,850
You've got mail.

1825
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:45,090
Discount in the Etsy shop.

1826
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:46,350
What did she sell?

1827
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:47,850
What did she sell on Etsy?

1828
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:50,990
Polls and gratitude discord access.

1829
01:43:51,610 --> 01:43:52,750
Oh my god, there's a discord?

1830
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:53,090
Discord?

1831
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:57,310
What's the good stuff?

1832
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:11,720
The VC in there must be insane.

1833
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,300
What if we like took it over?

1834
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,840
We had a Wisp invasion.

1835
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:31,520
Could we match their freak?

1836
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:32,180
Honestly?

1837
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:35,880
I'm not so sure.

1838
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:40,860
Honestly, I think we'd be in trouble.

1839
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:44,140
Where is the rest of it?

1840
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,360
Please.

1841
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:55,140
Please be clean.

1842
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:04,690
Where else...

1843
01:45:04,690 --> 01:45:07,210
Would we want to match it?

1844
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:13,370
I think...

1845
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:16,130
Guys, I'm afraid that we would be like...

1846
01:45:16,130 --> 01:45:17,730
Look at us.

1847
01:45:18,210 --> 01:45:19,810
Invading this freak's discord.

1848
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:21,830
Look at these guys.

1849
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:22,910
They...

1850
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:28,510
They're so into the minotaurs and balls.

1851
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:30,890
And then it would be funny.

1852
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:31,730
And then we'd be like...

1853
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:33,050
We're reading every book.

1854
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:35,570
And then we would have discussions.

1855
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:38,490
And then it would become serious.

1856
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:43,290
I feel like...

1857
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:45,070
Then we'd be like...

1858
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:45,670
Oh no.

1859
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:49,030
We'd be having serious discussion about like...

1860
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:51,830
Stuff, you know?

1861
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:57,210
I feel like it wouldn't be...

1862
01:45:57,210 --> 01:45:58,570
A joke anymore.

1863
01:45:59,230 --> 01:46:00,030
Oh, finally.

1864
01:46:00,570 --> 01:46:02,090
We cleaned a single roof.

1865
01:46:11,070 --> 01:46:12,050
Got it.

1866
01:46:18,230 --> 01:46:19,070
Rooftop.

1867
01:46:19,650 --> 01:46:20,490
Completed.

1868
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:25,920
Completed.

1869
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:27,940
In the book club stream.

1870
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:33,060
I think you guys actually want me to go insane.

1871
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:38,240
I think you guys actually want me to suffer.

1872
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:40,400
Yes.

1873
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:44,360
At least you're honest.

1874
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:44,420
At least.

1875
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,660
I hate cleaning the rooftops.

1876
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:50,740
How many are there?

1877
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:52,160
One.

1878
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,960
I guess just the two.

1879
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:58,900
Okay.

1880
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:00,140
Okay.

1881
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:01,520
Pick up.

1882
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:04,320
Go over here.

1883
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,480
Literature club.

1884
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:11,520
Honestly, why doesn't...

1885
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:15,260
Doki should start one and then she can call it the actual Doki Doki literature club.

1886
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:20,260
No copyright.

1887
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,420
But I don't think Doki can read.

1888
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:31,190
I don't think she can read.

1889
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:34,230
It's a distressingly good idea.

1890
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:37,590
She can't read.

1891
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:40,650
Guys, it's no good.

1892
01:47:41,630 --> 01:47:44,270
We have to stop the idea as soon as it was born.

1893
01:47:45,790 --> 01:47:47,370
We've already hit our major hurdle.

1894
01:47:50,410 --> 01:47:52,850
The most important aspect of the book club.

1895
01:47:54,610 --> 01:47:56,030
Doki's inability to read.

1896
01:47:59,710 --> 01:48:00,830
She's too birdbrained.

1897
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:12,500
Audiobooks exist.

1898
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:14,700
Yeah, that's how I get through mine.

1899
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:18,060
Just listen to the audiobook and fall asleep.

1900
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:23,380
But again, the birdbrain.

1901
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:30,660
Doki Doki learns how to read club.

1902
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:36,220
It's a work in progress.

1903
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:38,380
The title is a work in progress.

1904
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:49,200
One day.

1905
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:51,760
Do you ever have freaky dreams from your books?

1906
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,600
Like, sexy dreams?

1907
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:59,240
I just have freaky dreams in general.

1908
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:00,540
Not sexy dreams.

1909
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:05,760
But like, things about...

1910
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,980
Oh gosh, I had one recently.

1911
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:12,700
I did have one last night that I was like...

1912
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:15,300
Like I had all these...

1913
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:19,220
I grew all these... I had all these boils on my face.

1914
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:22,680
I don't think that has anything to do with minotaurs.

1915
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:30,560
Junji Ito?

1916
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:31,060
Maybe!

1917
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:37,300
Oh my gosh, I've been hearing about the Uzumaki anime, right?

1918
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:41,980
I've never read erotica stuff like Fifty Shades of Grey.

1919
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:50,220
But for a beginner-slash-baby-step, I recommend a series called Alia Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian.

1920
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:50,800
Oh!

1921
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:51,820
Wait, the light novel!

1922
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,220
Wait, there's spicy scenes in that?

1923
01:49:58,460 --> 01:50:00,660
I have a... I have a...

1924
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:03,880
An acrylic stand of that character before the anime came out.

1925
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:06,200
Because I like the artist...

1926
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:09,000
Who does the... What's it called?

1927
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,120
The character designer?

1928
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:24,420
Why can't... Why can't it work here?

1929
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:26,380
Why can't I put the ladder here?

1930
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:28,200
So annoying.

1931
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:31,860
Just put it on the ground.

1932
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:33,660
How do I get rid of it?

1933
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:35,020
There.

1934
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:43,840
Wait, no.

1935
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:45,120
That's always there.

1936
01:50:47,420 --> 01:50:50,100
The sister is more popular.

1937
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:53,860
I have a lot of dreams about school.

1938
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:57,580
When I first started streaming, I had many...

1939
01:50:57,580 --> 01:51:02,600
Dreams about, like, accidentally leaving my...

1940
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,260
Like, my stream going.

1941
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:08,660
Oh, Tori!

1942
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,120
Thank you for the raid!

1943
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:13,020
Hello everybody, my name is Mint Fanto!

1944
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:15,140
I'm a ghost maid.

1945
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:16,820
We're in Shrek Land.

1946
01:51:20,810 --> 01:51:22,550
Like the Vtuber anime?

1947
01:51:24,230 --> 01:51:25,190
Yes, similar.

1948
01:51:25,650 --> 01:51:27,870
I would, like, have dreams that...

1949
01:51:27,870 --> 01:51:31,150
My stream would be, like, going on my phone.

1950
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:32,970
And I would go to sleep.

1951
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:36,690
And then, I would, like, talk in my sleep.

1952
01:51:36,990 --> 01:51:37,610
Or fart.

1953
01:51:41,050 --> 01:51:42,170
And that...

1954
01:51:42,170 --> 01:51:45,010
It was all caught on camera.

1955
01:51:46,190 --> 01:51:48,870
And I had, like, legitimate nightmares about it.

1956
01:51:51,010 --> 01:51:51,970
Oh my gosh.

1957
01:51:53,210 --> 01:51:55,470
One time I had a dream that I...

1958
01:51:55,470 --> 01:51:59,490
Sent the wrong link of a YouTube video to chat.

1959
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:04,350
And everybody made fun of me for it.

1960
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,820
I was like, check out this video.

1961
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,960
And then it led to another video.

1962
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:17,400
And everyone was just like, oh my gosh.

1963
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:19,580
You watch this?

1964
01:52:21,020 --> 01:52:21,500
So...

1965
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:23,400
This is so embarrassing.

1966
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:29,760
I can't believe you're a fan of that.

1967
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:30,920
I was like, no, no, no.

1968
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:34,680
I didn't...I wasn't watching that.

1969
01:52:38,140 --> 01:52:39,780
This is so embarrassing.

1970
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,300
And I had a dream about it.

1971
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:43,420
And everybody made fun of me.

1972
01:52:44,980 --> 01:52:46,740
I had a dream...

1973
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:51,040
Oh, I'd have a nightmare if you accidentally started a stream with your spicy audiobooks.

1974
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:54,400
The lady who narrates them too is just so...

1975
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:56,340
Well, she was the ones...

1976
01:52:56,340 --> 01:52:57,980
The cambric ones.

1977
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,020
The monster ones.

1978
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:03,480
Oh my goodness.

1979
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:06,640
How did I get up here?

1980
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:10,040
We would never make fun of you.

1981
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:11,200
Really?

1982
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:15,260
What if it was like...

1983
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:18,760
What if it was like something really cringe?

1984
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:21,880
Like a Jake Paul video.

1985
01:53:27,690 --> 01:53:28,810
Or Logan Paul.

1986
01:53:28,870 --> 01:53:30,010
I don't know which one is different.

1987
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:30,130
Which?

1988
01:53:33,930 --> 01:53:35,790
Okay, then I would see!

1989
01:53:37,470 --> 01:53:39,030
He would make fun of me.

1990
01:53:40,650 --> 01:53:45,370
But I don't even watch them, so don't get it twisted.

1991
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:46,950
That was just an example.

1992
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:49,550
That was just an example, okay?

1993
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:53,790
Wait, wait.

1994
01:53:54,210 --> 01:53:55,490
This place...

1995
01:53:55,490 --> 01:53:56,310
It's another shop.

1996
01:53:58,550 --> 01:53:59,310
Okay.

1997
01:53:59,970 --> 01:54:02,710
This is the old freak shop for real.

1998
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:12,010
Let's get some Starbees.

1999
01:54:14,410 --> 01:54:15,170
Dang.

2000
01:54:17,170 --> 01:54:18,310
It could be...

2001
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:20,110
Freaky coffee, yeah.

2002
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:22,510
It's so...

2003
01:54:22,510 --> 01:54:24,930
It's so delicious, it's freaky.

2004
01:54:25,810 --> 01:54:26,690
You know?

2005
01:54:27,070 --> 01:54:28,430
One of those types of situations.

2006
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:34,050
It's PSL season.

2007
01:54:34,230 --> 01:54:35,450
Oh my gosh.

2008
01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:38,010
Absolutely, I even got...

2009
01:54:38,010 --> 01:54:40,210
Well, I don't get the pumpkin spice latte.

2010
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:42,590
But I...

2011
01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:47,410
A coffee place by me has like a different type of pumpkin drink.

2012
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:50,190
I went out and got it today.

2013
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:52,030
I was like, I'm craving this.

2014
01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:53,550
I'm gonna have it.

2015
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:55,110
So I went and got it.

2016
01:54:57,450 --> 01:54:59,190
Oh, you're a quiet one, aren't you?

2017
01:54:59,190 --> 01:55:00,830
Much like myself.

2018
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:03,290
Lord Farquaad.

2019
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:05,350
What else you got to say?

2020
01:55:06,590 --> 01:55:09,230
Yeah, I'm a mint of few words.

2021
01:55:11,770 --> 01:55:14,730
I pride myself on speaking only when absolutely necessary.

2022
01:55:14,870 --> 01:55:19,130
Using the fewest words that is possible used to articulate my train of thought.

2023
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:25,310
That's why he used so few words to say that whole sentence.

2024
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:32,390
I know people are just like, oh my gosh, the pumpkin spice latte is like so overrated.

2025
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:35,430
But also, I hate those people.

2026
01:55:37,110 --> 01:55:37,590
Because...

2027
01:55:37,590 --> 01:55:40,590
Why can't I just get something because it's delicious, you know?

2028
01:55:40,910 --> 01:55:42,290
Oh, no more, no less.

2029
01:55:42,530 --> 01:55:46,550
Just the absolute minimum number of words to get across the brilliance of the idea itself.

2030
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:52,740
Wow, pumpkin spice latte is so good!

2031
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,420
Oh wait, hold on, my chat froze.

2032
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,060
What makes it spice?

2033
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:01,140
I've never had it.

2034
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:09,160
I know sometimes they put like cinnamon and stuff.

2035
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:10,980
And then the pumpkin taste.

2036
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:13,100
And what is it?

2037
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:15,460
It's a nutmeg, I think.

2038
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:17,140
It is nutmeg.

2039
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,000
My YouTube crashed.

2040
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:21,620
Give me a moment, I'm so sorry.

2041
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:24,760
Saying good things are overrated is lame.

2042
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:29,260
I just think they just don't want people to be happy and enjoy.

2043
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:31,420
You know?

2044
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:33,360
Just enjoy.

2045
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:36,080
Who cares if it's a popular thing?

2046
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:39,180
No fun allowed.

2047
01:56:41,660 --> 01:56:44,320
It doesn't even have pumpkin in it, it doesn't?

2048
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:46,960
Well...

2049
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:48,800
It tastes good.

2050
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:53,000
It tastes yummy.

2051
01:56:57,880 --> 01:56:59,020
Just the spice.

2052
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:01,560
Oh, it's the spice that makes it taste like a pumpkin.

2053
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:05,640
Oh well, who cares?

2054
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:07,640
Oh my gosh, sorry guys.

2055
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:09,340
My YouTube is so broken right now.

2056
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:12,520
I can't see anything.

2057
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:13,360
Oh, there we go.

2058
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:21,860
Pumpkin is pretty much tasteless.

2059
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:23,120
I wouldn't say that.

2060
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,860
Maybe it also depends on...

2061
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,600
Depends on where you get it from, right?

2062
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:39,160
Pirate505 I know a place where they actually put pumpkin pulp in it.

2063
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:40,420
Tastes surprisingly nice.

2064
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:43,680
Depends on where you get it from.

2065
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:46,320
Depends on where you get it.

2066
01:57:53,260 --> 01:57:54,640
Guys, I'm so sick of this area.

2067
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:55,580
We have a lot.

2068
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:58,780
We have so much left.

2069
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:01,140
It feels like we're never gonna make it.

2070
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:05,840
We're never gonna make it, guys.

2071
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,480
I'm sick of Duloc.

2072
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,720
Why is this the first level?

2073
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,020
This should be the last level.

2074
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:17,300
It's humongous.

2075
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:20,280
60% still to go.

2076
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:22,060
Oh my gosh.

2077
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:26,140
Pumpkin spice.

2078
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:27,960
Still is good.

2079
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:29,120
Yeah!

2080
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:32,820
I realized I didn't get the summer merch when I thought I did.

2081
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:34,120
I died on the inside.

2082
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:35,240
No!

2083
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:37,660
Can't wait for your 3.0 model.

2084
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:38,500
Thank you!

2085
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:39,680
Thanks Onix!

2086
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:42,060
Me too, I'm so excited.

2087
01:58:43,620 --> 01:58:45,460
I hope everything gets done in time though.

2088
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:47,160
I'm stressing out.

2089
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:53,650
Who the heck is Hugh?

2090
01:58:53,990 --> 01:58:55,470
The guy that owns this place.

2091
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:09,500
I worked at Starbs for years.

2092
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:12,780
And every year, there were dudes being jerks about people drinking PSL.

2093
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:14,860
Anyway, I get mine with a little bit of chai syrup.

2094
01:59:15,380 --> 01:59:15,780
Yeah!

2095
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:17,300
With chai syrup.

2096
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:18,660
It's so good.

2097
01:59:19,620 --> 01:59:20,480
Yummy, yummy.

2098
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:26,700
Enjoy your drinks, everybody.

2099
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:30,240
If you like it, enjoy it.

2100
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:36,540
If they just served it all year round...

2101
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:38,380
Nobody would get so...

2102
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:39,560
Feral for it.

2103
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:42,480
Speaking of feral, I'm kind of hungry.

2104
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:44,580
I didn't have dinner.

2105
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,640
I thought I would be okay.

2106
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:54,500
Since I had a late breakfast.

2107
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:58,140
And then I finished eating the breakfast right before stream.

2108
01:59:59,740 --> 02:00:00,300
Hmm...

2109
02:00:03,710 --> 02:00:05,070
Maybe I'll grab a snack.

2110
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:18,440
Place here has honey vanilla lattes in the fall.

2111
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:20,240
Yum.

2112
02:00:24,100 --> 02:00:25,140
Yummy, yummy.

2113
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:28,000
You guys are making me hungry.

2114
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:33,740
I finished making stuffed bell peppers.

2115
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:34,880
Oh my god, stop!

2116
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:35,740
That sounds delicious!

2117
02:00:35,740 --> 02:00:36,560
Okay.

2118
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:40,980
Resting glitch face, you're invited over to the maid cafe to cook.

2119
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:41,800
Only for me.

2120
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:43,740
Not for the patrons.

2121
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:48,240
They can fend for themselves.

2122
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:49,980
So come over here.

2123
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:54,180
You have two minutes.

2124
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:09,740
Can we use the stove?

2125
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:13,980
No, it's preoccupied.

2126
02:01:17,060 --> 02:01:18,200
It's busy.

2127
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:21,800
Late breakfast.

2128
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:23,080
Girl, you had brunch.

2129
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:24,420
Oh my god.

2130
02:01:25,740 --> 02:01:27,380
Take me to brunch first.

2131
02:01:34,740 --> 02:01:36,420
Reporting for duty.

2132
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:45,360
Guess I'm chopped liver, huh?

2133
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:46,320
What?

2134
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:46,820
No!

2135
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:52,900
Anybody who is willing to cook for me can come over.

2136
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:55,620
Okay.

2137
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:01,400
I just need food.

2138
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:05,860
Can I cook you mushrooms?

2139
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:06,440
Nevermind.

2140
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:10,480
Anybody who is wanting to poison me...

2141
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:14,000
I can make toast.

2142
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:18,220
But can you deliver a mean toast?

2143
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:23,060
Gosh, I hate this.

2144
02:02:23,580 --> 02:02:24,660
The awnings and everything.

2145
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:26,560
This place sucks!

2146
02:02:27,060 --> 02:02:29,020
Get me out of here, Lord Farquaad, please!

2147
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:30,420
I'll be good.

2148
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:34,840
We're only 42% cleaned.

2149
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:49,040
Skip it?

2150
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:49,640
Can I?

2151
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:52,180
Can I skip it?

2152
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:03,420
I wish they let you choose what level you want to do.

2153
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:05,380
Power Wash Simulator, please.

2154
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:10,000
Please, Power Wash Simulator.

2155
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:14,300
Please let me skip the level.

2156
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:17,400
I'm not feeling relaxed anymore.

2157
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:20,260
Skip it, skip it.

2158
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:25,320
Let's at least get the ground.

2159
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:26,700
Was that cigarettes?

2160
02:03:26,700 --> 02:03:29,000
Was that like a cigarette butt?

2161
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:29,700
What was that?

2162
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:33,960
Herb-crusted lamb chops.

2163
02:03:34,060 --> 02:03:35,280
Stop, it sounds so good.

2164
02:03:37,820 --> 02:03:38,960
I'm so hungry.

2165
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:41,360
You probably have level 2 unlocked now.

2166
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:44,000
Probably once we get to...

2167
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,580
What's it called?

2168
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:47,580
Halfway, maybe.

2169
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:51,840
Wait, don't they message you?

2170
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:52,540
Aren't they just like...

2171
02:03:52,540 --> 02:03:54,820
Hey, by the way, I have another place that needs cleaning.

2172
02:03:54,820 --> 02:03:56,140
Can you like...

2173
02:03:56,140 --> 02:03:57,640
They message you.

2174
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:58,640
They're just like, oh yeah.

2175
02:03:59,160 --> 02:04:01,240
Can you also handle this other place that I have?

2176
02:04:01,740 --> 02:04:02,820
So we just gotta get to there.

2177
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,480
Doki had it at 46.

2178
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:16,540
It was intended to use detergent on?

2179
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:18,380
But they don't even give you...

2180
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:20,780
I mean, they'll maybe have jetpacks.

2181
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:21,280
Thank you.

2182
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:25,180
What do you want with the jetpacks?

2183
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:27,200
I feel like I've been asked this before.

2184
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:29,780
What are you trying to do with the jetpacks, huh?

2185
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:35,580
Got my first Vtuber merch the other day from Green Lady.

2186
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:40,040
Green Lady doesn't really narrow it down.

2187
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:45,120
I feel like I might be falling into a merch rabbit hole.

2188
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:48,400
Enjoy collecting.

2189
02:04:53,210 --> 02:04:54,150
What is this?

2190
02:04:55,350 --> 02:04:56,310
Oh, it's a knight.

2191
02:04:57,090 --> 02:04:58,890
Wow, this is actually pretty...

2192
02:05:05,210 --> 02:05:05,850
Execution.

2193
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:13,840
Wait.

2194
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:23,520
This is a crime scene.

2195
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:27,400
There we go.

2196
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:30,940
Clean that lash?

2197
02:05:31,060 --> 02:05:31,240
Yeah.

2198
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:33,320
I'm not cleaning this at all.

2199
02:05:34,820 --> 02:05:36,180
This is real art.

2200
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:39,180
What's that guy who, like...

2201
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:43,160
Does art and then, like, burns it or something?

2202
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:44,660
Or shreds it or something?

2203
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:55,160
This could be Banksy art.

2204
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:03,820
I didn't know his name.

2205
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:05,260
Bubsy is right.

2206
02:06:13,940 --> 02:06:15,660
Oh my god, look at him now.

2207
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:19,420
I do want to keep getting the floors though.

2208
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:29,860
What if we, like, clean so much that he disappears and does the whole, like...

2209
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:30,320
Bling bling!

2210
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:31,200
You did it!

2211
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:32,780
Bling bling!

2212
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:38,120
New name, Bubsy.

2213
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:01,940
I want to do the karaoke soon.

2214
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:04,680
When we get the message, I'll do the karaoke.

2215
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:06,680
Over here looks good enough.

2216
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:07,780
Right?

2217
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:09,380
You wouldn't... Hold on.

2218
02:07:09,460 --> 02:07:10,720
If we even... Up here.

2219
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:12,940
Like, if we went up here...

2220
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:18,160
And here... And here... And here...

2221
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:19,180
You don't look at that side.

2222
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:21,220
See, like, from here... Oh, wait!

2223
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:23,740
We gotta clean those... We gotta clean those ears.

2224
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:29,840
Clean the ears.

2225
02:07:32,740 --> 02:07:33,120
Okay.

2226
02:07:46,050 --> 02:07:49,130
Clean those... Those guys out.

2227
02:07:49,770 --> 02:07:51,570
Oh, they're so filled with wax.

2228
02:07:51,730 --> 02:07:52,990
Okay, here we go.

2229
02:08:05,810 --> 02:08:07,090
Can you hear better?

2230
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:13,070
Let me know...

2231
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:19,150
The sound of breaking.

2232
02:08:46,970 --> 02:08:47,510
Sorry.

2233
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:53,220
Did you hear the break?

2234
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:08,660
Is it not dirty all around?

2235
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:09,680
Just certain parts?

2236
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:09,980
Okay.

2237
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:13,000
Heard a little rat.

2238
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:20,600
My eardrums were pressure washed out of my skull.

2239
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:23,120
And that's how you do it to them.

2240
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:25,680
Never let them know...

2241
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:27,620
What you'll say next.

2242
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,320
Because they can't hear.

2243
02:09:34,470 --> 02:09:35,410
Okay, nice.

2244
02:09:35,410 --> 02:09:35,450
Nice.

2245
02:09:44,490 --> 02:09:46,330
Let's clean up some of this...

2246
02:09:46,330 --> 02:09:47,390
So that...

2247
02:09:47,390 --> 02:09:49,170
So that we can...

2248
02:09:49,170 --> 02:09:50,170
Make it look nice.

2249
02:09:50,970 --> 02:09:52,810
Even if it's a fake nice, you know?

2250
02:09:53,010 --> 02:09:53,510
46?

2251
02:09:54,130 --> 02:09:54,630
Okay.

2252
02:09:57,550 --> 02:09:58,070
Hello...

2253
02:09:59,350 --> 02:09:59,870
Farquad...

2254
02:09:59,870 --> 02:10:02,190
I'm waiting for your call...

2255
02:10:03,610 --> 02:10:04,130
Tonight...

2256
02:10:04,130 --> 02:10:05,970
For you to say...

2257
02:10:05,970 --> 02:10:08,410
That I can leave this place...

2258
02:10:08,410 --> 02:10:10,690
Let me leave this place...

2259
02:10:10,690 --> 02:10:12,410
Oh, please...

2260
02:10:16,110 --> 02:10:17,510
We're at 46%.

2261
02:10:17,510 --> 02:10:18,430
Come on!

2262
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:23,750
You can install an extension to increase your power washer reach.

2263
02:10:24,350 --> 02:10:26,830
But it's not letting me buy anything, is it?

2264
02:10:28,230 --> 02:10:29,670
Oh my god!

2265
02:10:30,290 --> 02:10:31,930
The long long extension!

2266
02:10:31,930 --> 02:10:34,950
Have you watched any anime this season?

2267
02:10:35,090 --> 02:10:38,410
I wasn't expecting anything besides ReZero, but Science Saru...

2268
02:10:38,410 --> 02:10:39,890
Is cooking with Dandodan.

2269
02:10:40,090 --> 02:10:42,530
I actually haven't watched anything.

2270
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:50,900
I haven't even started ReZero.

2271
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:53,020
It's a fake fan.

2272
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:59,940
Is it because I don't have those soap nozzles that I can't buy the soaps?

2273
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:00,940
You think?

2274
02:11:07,730 --> 02:11:09,590
I'm gonna buy this long extension.

2275
02:11:12,990 --> 02:11:13,870
And this...

2276
02:11:13,870 --> 02:11:16,310
Wait, now...

2277
02:11:18,050 --> 02:11:19,950
Long extension... Well, I don't need it right now.

2278
02:11:20,310 --> 02:11:21,270
We need the stubby gun.

2279
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:26,650
I bought it, but I'm already up here.

2280
02:11:31,730 --> 02:11:33,530
I bought it, but I'm already up here.

2281
02:11:34,450 --> 02:11:36,130
A little bit of a waste of my money.

2282
02:11:36,530 --> 02:11:37,130
But that's fine.

2283
02:11:39,970 --> 02:11:42,130
I've seen the Dandodan opening.

2284
02:11:42,870 --> 02:11:44,330
The Creepy Nuts song.

2285
02:11:46,290 --> 02:11:47,510
It is quite good.

2286
02:11:49,370 --> 02:11:51,870
I do feel that they have...

2287
02:11:51,870 --> 02:11:53,210
They're one of those types of bands.

2288
02:11:53,350 --> 02:11:55,590
Kind of like Yosobi, where they...

2289
02:11:55,590 --> 02:11:59,730
I don't want to say their song sounds same-y, but they definitely have a distinct style.

2290
02:11:59,910 --> 02:12:01,090
So it's like...

2291
02:12:01,090 --> 02:12:04,570
You hear it and you're just like, oh yeah, this is their song.

2292
02:12:10,330 --> 02:12:11,990
Very much like Yosobi.

2293
02:12:13,630 --> 02:12:14,810
Oh, no, no.

2294
02:12:14,950 --> 02:12:15,510
There we go.

2295
02:12:15,850 --> 02:12:16,150
Nice.

2296
02:12:18,670 --> 02:12:19,150
Nice!

2297
02:12:23,200 --> 02:12:26,640
What was the other one that they did somewhat recently?

2298
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:29,600
And I was just like, oh my gosh, this is from the same series.

2299
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:31,860
When I heard the Dandodan opening.

2300
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:42,660
Oh my gosh, I wish I were those birds.

2301
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:43,720
Free.

2302
02:12:43,720 --> 02:12:47,100
Able to leave this horrid city.

2303
02:12:48,820 --> 02:12:52,180
Yeah, that one.

2304
02:13:00,660 --> 02:13:01,700
Please.

2305
02:13:07,630 --> 02:13:09,270
Let me spray it.

2306
02:13:11,250 --> 02:13:12,250
Let me clean.

2307
02:13:12,810 --> 02:13:13,230
Mom!

2308
02:13:13,230 --> 02:13:15,290
Let me clean.

2309
02:13:15,910 --> 02:13:16,870
It's in my blood.

2310
02:13:17,470 --> 02:13:18,890
I was born to be a cleaner.

2311
02:13:19,550 --> 02:13:20,010
Nice.

2312
02:13:21,190 --> 02:13:21,650
Nice.

2313
02:13:23,650 --> 02:13:26,030
The way the guy raps is just so distinct and unique too.

2314
02:13:26,150 --> 02:13:26,410
Yeah!

2315
02:13:29,630 --> 02:13:30,710
Yeah, it's their style.

2316
02:13:30,910 --> 02:13:32,190
Oh, it does work, like I said.

2317
02:13:33,190 --> 02:13:34,110
It does work.

2318
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:37,810
You don't think that the text is timed, right?

2319
02:13:38,350 --> 02:13:40,230
Rather than being like a...

2320
02:13:42,410 --> 02:13:43,530
Like a...

2321
02:13:43,530 --> 02:13:44,490
Progression thing.

2322
02:13:46,210 --> 02:13:47,630
Dang it, this is the haircut.

2323
02:13:48,910 --> 02:13:50,230
Wait a second, this is...

2324
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:51,210
This is a hair salon?

2325
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:53,370
Shrek, you don't have hair?

2326
02:13:54,770 --> 02:13:56,210
Denied, denied, denied.

2327
02:13:58,510 --> 02:13:59,910
Denied, denied, denied.

2328
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:06,900
What a liar.

2329
02:14:07,340 --> 02:14:09,720
Never trust a bald person with cutting your hair.

2330
02:14:15,030 --> 02:14:17,490
He's got little white hairs like an onion.

2331
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:22,350
He does?

2332
02:14:29,230 --> 02:14:30,210
On his head?

2333
02:14:31,050 --> 02:14:32,850
As a bald person, I approve this message.

2334
02:14:37,530 --> 02:14:40,170
Okay, let's get the other ear waxing.

2335
02:14:41,290 --> 02:14:41,890
Surely...

2336
02:14:41,890 --> 02:14:43,390
Surely then...

2337
02:14:44,050 --> 02:14:46,010
We'll get the text to leave this place.

2338
02:14:47,390 --> 02:14:49,430
Surely, we will be able to leave...

2339
02:14:50,530 --> 02:14:51,790
After cleaning this.

2340
02:14:54,910 --> 02:14:55,510
Surely...

2341
02:14:55,510 --> 02:14:57,410
We'll be able to free...

2342
02:14:57,410 --> 02:14:58,830
Be freed from this prison.

2343
02:15:00,390 --> 02:15:01,390
The Lord Farquaad...

2344
02:15:03,330 --> 02:15:03,630
Has...

2345
02:15:04,070 --> 02:15:05,070
Imprisoned us in.

2346
02:15:09,060 --> 02:15:09,960
Who's Shirley?

2347
02:15:11,180 --> 02:15:12,160
Your mom.

2348
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:14,900
This is a neighbor.

2349
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:16,020
She's very nice.

2350
02:15:16,580 --> 02:15:17,260
I came over.

2351
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:20,460
Last night, I went over there last night.

2352
02:15:21,680 --> 02:15:23,040
After I met your mom.

2353
02:15:30,980 --> 02:15:32,940
Don't laugh, you guys.

2354
02:15:34,140 --> 02:15:35,600
Don't laugh.

2355
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:36,320
That was lame.

2356
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:45,100
Good woman.

2357
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:46,820
That wasn't...

2358
02:15:46,820 --> 02:15:48,400
It's like my worst bit.

2359
02:15:50,780 --> 02:15:52,460
Wait, I can do the long.

2360
02:15:54,940 --> 02:15:55,580
Nice.

2361
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:58,140
Extension.

2362
02:15:58,140 --> 02:15:58,480
Extension.

2363
02:16:04,460 --> 02:16:06,560
Oh my gosh, it's really...

2364
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:06,940
Shooting.

2365
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:10,780
Can you rank your own bits?

2366
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:15,220
What are my bits?

2367
02:16:18,100 --> 02:16:20,560
Actually, number one bit...

2368
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:22,440
Which is not even a bit at this point.

2369
02:16:22,940 --> 02:16:24,260
Truly like...

2370
02:16:24,260 --> 02:16:26,080
Another part of me.

2371
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:27,460
Is Frogbert.

2372
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:27,540
Frogbert.

2373
02:16:29,780 --> 02:16:31,240
Vtuber Y is a good one.

2374
02:16:32,340 --> 02:16:33,000
Can I get...

2375
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:34,740
I don't know if I can take credit for that one.

2376
02:16:36,320 --> 02:16:38,240
Can I technically take credit for that?

2377
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:38,880
Who knows.

2378
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:51,560
I can.

2379
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:54,680
It's funny when...

2380
02:16:56,680 --> 02:16:57,120
Sometimes...

2381
02:16:57,120 --> 02:16:58,200
You know...

2382
02:16:58,200 --> 02:17:00,340
There will be like clips of whatever.

2383
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:02,500
Things I say.

2384
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:03,660
Things I do.

2385
02:17:04,900 --> 02:17:06,900
And I'll see like comments from people.

2386
02:17:07,700 --> 02:17:08,780
Just being like, wow.

2387
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:11,680
This girl has to watch...

2388
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:12,880
This one channel.

2389
02:17:13,440 --> 02:17:14,980
She probably got this idea.

2390
02:17:15,580 --> 02:17:16,740
Vtuber Y or whatever.

2391
02:17:16,940 --> 02:17:18,480
From this channel or something.

2392
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:20,960
And they'll name a channel of...

2393
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:22,720
Something I've never even heard of before.

2394
02:17:24,260 --> 02:17:25,620
And I'll be like...

2395
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:29,620
Like I know I'm not so original.

2396
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:32,120
But it's just funny when people are like...

2397
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:34,640
Oh yeah, she had to have gotten the idea from here.

2398
02:17:35,540 --> 02:17:37,440
No, I just...

2399
02:17:39,360 --> 02:17:40,880
It just came to me.

2400
02:17:42,420 --> 02:17:43,860
Kangol-chan copypasta.

2401
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:46,160
Can I take...

2402
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:47,760
Am I allowed to take credit for that too?

2403
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:52,340
I don't know.

2404
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:55,160
Am I allowed to take...

2405
02:17:58,200 --> 02:17:59,640
We're reaching into territories.

2406
02:18:07,190 --> 02:18:08,690
Did I get this poll?

2407
02:18:10,210 --> 02:18:11,530
Oh wait, I didn't finish it though.

2408
02:18:13,670 --> 02:18:16,250
Guys, we're at 48 and I didn't get the text!

2409
02:18:18,330 --> 02:18:22,550
Would it be okay to take a well behaved 4 year old to a maid cafe like maid dreaming or at home?

2410
02:18:22,890 --> 02:18:24,230
Yeah, I think so.

2411
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:28,090
I don't think they have any rules...

2412
02:18:28,090 --> 02:18:29,870
Like, I think it'd be fine.

2413
02:18:29,870 --> 02:18:31,530
That's not a dumb question.

2414
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:41,360
He's busy.

2415
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:45,080
Like I said, you don't think it's timed, right?

2416
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,420
Where Doki took more time or something and...

2417
02:18:50,020 --> 02:18:51,360
That's why...

2418
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:53,040
They gave her the option sooner.

2419
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:09,840
Probably took pity on her.

2420
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:12,840
They were like, don't you want to play the rest of the game?

2421
02:19:22,120 --> 02:19:23,960
You can check the menu for other missions.

2422
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:24,740
Let's see.

2423
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:29,580
Wait, under...

2424
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:33,580
If I leave... Wait, if I click this...

2425
02:19:33,580 --> 02:19:34,100
Oh, Shrek.

2426
02:19:36,440 --> 02:19:36,920
No...

2427
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:39,940
No...

2428
02:19:41,580 --> 02:19:42,060
No...

2429
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:44,020
No...

2430
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:51,040
Okay.

2431
02:19:54,180 --> 02:19:54,660
Guys...

2432
02:19:57,020 --> 02:19:57,600
Sorry.

2433
02:19:59,340 --> 02:20:00,220
Guys, sorry.

2434
02:20:05,020 --> 02:20:09,400
Can you remind me of the name of that famous actor from La La Land?

2435
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:14,620
Mr. Ryan.

2436
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:18,960
Oh, blacksmith.

2437
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:22,960
I thought these would be more like funny haha things, you know?

2438
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:27,900
His name is Ryan.

2439
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:29,960
Ryan who?

2440
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:35,100
Oh gosh, I can't remember under pressure!

2441
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:36,660
Okay, is Ryan...

2442
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:42,240
There's only... It could only be one or two.

2443
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:43,220
One or two.

2444
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:45,000
You guys pick one or two.

2445
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:45,800
Pick one or two.

2446
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:49,160
Reynolds?

2447
02:20:52,440 --> 02:20:52,880
Two.

2448
02:20:55,220 --> 02:20:55,940
Gosling.

2449
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:58,220
In my head, two was Gosling.

2450
02:20:58,700 --> 02:20:59,540
One was Reynolds.

2451
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:11,660
Two is correct.

2452
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:12,420
Reynolds.

2453
02:21:14,820 --> 02:21:17,160
Ryan Reynolds is from La La Land.

2454
02:21:18,700 --> 02:21:19,660
You're welcome.

2455
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:22,440
Gosling, sorry.

2456
02:21:28,950 --> 02:21:30,030
Ryan Gosling...

2457
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:33,770
Is from La La Land.

2458
02:21:35,570 --> 02:21:37,630
No, that is not the real Ryan.

2459
02:21:37,790 --> 02:21:39,430
Maybe I have to watch this part.

2460
02:21:41,290 --> 02:21:42,750
See, we're at 50%.

2461
02:21:42,750 --> 02:21:44,150
Lord Farquaad, please.

2462
02:21:44,570 --> 02:21:45,470
Where's our phone?

2463
02:21:49,700 --> 02:21:50,620
Let me out!

2464
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:52,200
Let me out!

2465
02:21:57,070 --> 02:21:59,070
City of stars...

2466
02:22:00,730 --> 02:22:03,670
Are they calling just for me?

2467
02:22:05,170 --> 02:22:07,070
Calling my name...

2468
02:22:07,750 --> 02:22:10,530
What was that name again?

2469
02:22:20,910 --> 02:22:22,630
It's like when you're just like...

2470
02:22:22,630 --> 02:22:25,070
Oh my gosh, I was...

2471
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:29,290
I've had to do that before where I was just like...

2472
02:22:29,290 --> 02:22:30,970
I couldn't remember somebody's name.

2473
02:22:31,970 --> 02:22:32,890
They were just like...

2474
02:22:32,890 --> 02:22:34,650
Oh yeah, you can just write my name on it.

2475
02:22:34,670 --> 02:22:35,550
And I was like...

2476
02:22:35,550 --> 02:22:37,890
How do you write that?

2477
02:22:40,170 --> 02:22:41,630
And they were like...

2478
02:22:41,630 --> 02:22:43,610
They were like...

2479
02:22:43,610 --> 02:22:44,230
Michael?

2480
02:22:53,470 --> 02:22:54,190
Stupid Sharky!

2481
02:22:54,570 --> 02:22:55,870
Thanks for 6 months!

2482
02:22:55,970 --> 02:22:58,030
Oh my gosh, your profile picture is so cute.

2483
02:22:58,130 --> 02:22:59,210
What happened to the old one?

2484
02:23:03,430 --> 02:23:04,890
And I was like...

2485
02:23:04,890 --> 02:23:08,010
You know, sometimes Michael could be with a K.

2486
02:23:10,590 --> 02:23:11,270
Sometimes...

2487
02:23:11,270 --> 02:23:12,530
Like Stephanie.

2488
02:23:13,530 --> 02:23:14,930
Is it with an F?

2489
02:23:15,290 --> 02:23:16,130
Is it with a PH?

2490
02:23:17,010 --> 02:23:18,070
Nobody knows!

2491
02:23:23,670 --> 02:23:27,770
When MGSV TPP came out, that was the first MGS I played.

2492
02:23:27,910 --> 02:23:28,530
Forgive me.

2493
02:23:30,250 --> 02:23:31,710
All is forgiven.

2494
02:23:33,970 --> 02:23:34,390
Or not?

2495
02:23:41,710 --> 02:23:44,190
It could be... You don't know guys.

2496
02:23:44,270 --> 02:23:45,310
It could be...

2497
02:23:45,310 --> 02:23:47,130
Can I buy the... Hold on.

2498
02:23:48,230 --> 02:23:49,970
Can I buy the...

2499
02:23:49,970 --> 02:23:51,550
I like how it just says Shrek here.

2500
02:23:52,370 --> 02:23:52,830
Shop.

2501
02:23:54,830 --> 02:23:56,430
It's still out of stock!

2502
02:23:56,890 --> 02:24:00,990
Oh my gosh, I bought that extension for the cleaners for no reason.

2503
02:24:01,610 --> 02:24:03,910
I bought this soap nozzle for nothing.

2504
02:24:03,910 --> 02:24:07,930
It cost me 75 bucks!

2505
02:24:09,610 --> 02:24:10,970
We got scammed real.

2506
02:24:12,330 --> 02:24:15,530
And for some reason it won't let me buy these ones.

2507
02:24:20,290 --> 02:24:23,390
You have set soap bottles for DLC levels.

2508
02:24:24,470 --> 02:24:26,670
But it won't let me use it either though.

2509
02:24:27,170 --> 02:24:28,330
I can't even use it.

2510
02:24:38,110 --> 02:24:39,130
Scammed real.

2511
02:24:42,930 --> 02:24:43,790
Scammed real.

2512
02:24:43,790 --> 02:24:44,550
Scammed for real.

2513
02:24:45,650 --> 02:24:48,950
The Farquaad head was not even clean this entire time.

2514
02:24:55,190 --> 02:24:56,900
Eat up, Lord Farquaad.

2515
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:10,760
A soap nozzle.

2516
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:16,200
Oh my god.

2517
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:18,100
This is life changer.

2518
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:21,120
This is life changer.

2519
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:22,700
Oh my gosh.

2520
02:25:22,980 --> 02:25:24,720
It's going away so fast.

2521
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:27,060
Oh my gosh.

2522
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:29,640
Oh my gosh.

2523
02:25:30,200 --> 02:25:30,800
It's working.

2524
02:25:35,240 --> 02:25:36,680
Wait, only 2 liters.

2525
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:38,780
I can buy some more?

2526
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:46,420
Maybe I can't buy more.

2527
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:48,140
Will it let me buy more?

2528
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:50,940
There's a soap limit.

2529
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:52,480
This game hates us, for real.

2530
02:25:54,460 --> 02:25:55,620
This game hates us.

2531
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:56,360
Wait, what is this one?

2532
02:25:58,220 --> 02:26:00,080
Oh, this is the spinny one.

2533
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:01,940
Yeah, the spinny one is pretty good.

2534
02:26:03,060 --> 02:26:05,540
Because it gets in those good nooks and crannies.

2535
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:08,840
She hates us.

2536
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:21,440
Doki bird?

2537
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:28,920
Surely he texts at 60%.

2538
02:26:30,020 --> 02:26:32,000
Yeah, maybe you guys saw wrong.

2539
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:34,680
Maybe he texts at 60%.

2540
02:26:35,740 --> 02:26:36,540
You know?

2541
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:40,320
Maybe.

2542
02:26:41,340 --> 02:26:44,040
You guys saw wrong because it was like...

2543
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:45,980
Maybe it was the opposite.

2544
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:48,520
She had 40% left.

2545
02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:52,620
The real question is, does this game hate you more than you hate us?

2546
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:54,980
That could never ever be possible.

2547
02:26:57,160 --> 02:26:58,740
Nothing can...

2548
02:26:59,740 --> 02:27:00,660
Nothing...

2549
02:27:00,660 --> 02:27:03,120
I hate you guys the most.

2550
02:27:03,740 --> 02:27:18,520
Nothing can ever compare to the raw, unfiltered hatred I have for every single one of you here in this chat and watching the VOD, listening to my voice right now.

2551
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:24,420
I hate you guys so much!

2552
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:29,580
I hate you guys.

2553
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:39,440
You hear that chat?

2554
02:27:39,540 --> 02:27:40,700
We are irreplaceable.

2555
02:27:41,900 --> 02:27:43,220
E Trash!

2556
02:27:49,180 --> 02:27:50,440
I've been jamming.

2557
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:52,880
Thanks for 6 months of jamming.

2558
02:27:58,300 --> 02:28:00,360
Can you do that again as Lilac?

2559
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:01,300
No.

2560
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:04,460
I'm not...

2561
02:28:04,460 --> 02:28:07,280
I'm not here to fulfill your sick fantasies.

2562
02:28:07,340 --> 02:28:08,080
I hate you too.

2563
02:28:11,300 --> 02:28:12,960
I swear to god.

2564
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:14,880
I'm throwing you in that river.

2565
02:28:15,860 --> 02:28:17,400
I'm throwing you in that river.

2566
02:28:27,460 --> 02:28:28,160
ESL here.

2567
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:30,200
Is hatred a synonym for care and love?

2568
02:28:37,270 --> 02:28:37,790
No.

2569
02:28:52,650 --> 02:28:55,770
I could never say that I love you guys.

2570
02:28:56,190 --> 02:28:57,590
I could never say that.

2571
02:28:58,110 --> 02:29:00,190
If I ever said that, I would catch on fire.

2572
02:29:01,630 --> 02:29:03,370
Because I just hate you guys so much.

2573
02:29:10,850 --> 02:29:17,230
I would rather die again than say how much I love you guys.

2574
02:29:19,070 --> 02:29:24,330
I would rather die again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again.

2575
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:31,440
That's just how much I hate you guys.

2576
02:29:39,470 --> 02:29:40,690
Alright, I'll get the knife.

2577
02:29:47,510 --> 02:29:50,970
Okay, 55% baby.

2578
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:53,350
Maybe...oh wait.

2579
02:29:54,910 --> 02:29:56,090
Look right here.

2580
02:29:56,890 --> 02:29:58,150
This part needs to be cleaned.

2581
02:30:05,330 --> 02:30:07,370
Let's just get the roads clean.

2582
02:30:09,610 --> 02:30:10,310
Look,

2583
02:30:17,290 --> 02:30:18,350
it looks so nice.

2584
02:30:19,390 --> 02:30:21,610
Come on Farquaad, let me go.

2585
02:30:21,610 --> 02:30:23,650
It looks good.

2586
02:30:24,530 --> 02:30:27,370
It looks good, please let me go.

2587
02:30:30,230 --> 02:30:34,990
Maybe I have to get a little bit of each area to be freed, you know?

2588
02:30:37,370 --> 02:30:38,770
Maybe I just have to...

2589
02:30:39,370 --> 02:30:44,350
Just get a little bit of a taste for each area, you know?

2590
02:30:44,490 --> 02:30:46,730
And then he'll say, okay, good enough.

2591
02:30:48,250 --> 02:30:52,170
Do you remember that one wisp who hitchhiked from Mexico to Animate Fest for you?

2592
02:30:52,290 --> 02:30:52,750
Yes?

2593
02:30:55,250 --> 02:31:02,550
We know about security in Hamtaro Circle, but what was the concert staff's thoughts when the audience started chanting, she hates this for real.

2594
02:31:04,290 --> 02:31:05,850
Oh, for like...

2595
02:31:07,930 --> 02:31:08,970
For like...

2596
02:31:08,970 --> 02:31:10,730
What was the last thing I did?

2597
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:13,390
For the Hornet, for off-season?

2598
02:31:16,730 --> 02:31:18,470
I think, I don't know.

2599
02:31:21,970 --> 02:31:22,570
Actually...

2600
02:31:22,570 --> 02:31:24,210
I don't know what their thoughts were.

2601
02:31:26,390 --> 02:31:31,290
But they're VTuber fans, they probably know that all VTubers are like this, right?

2602
02:31:35,990 --> 02:31:36,990
Goodbye Shrek.

2603
02:31:43,550 --> 02:31:44,130
Shrek.

2604
02:31:45,250 --> 02:31:46,610
All VTubers are not like this?

2605
02:31:46,630 --> 02:31:47,310
What are you talking about?

2606
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:06,840
I'm unique.

2607
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:09,380
Unique New York.

2608
02:32:10,060 --> 02:32:11,620
You need New York.

2609
02:32:16,310 --> 02:32:17,650
Hi Aminto, I hope you're good lately.

2610
02:32:17,850 --> 02:32:18,550
I am!

2611
02:32:19,030 --> 02:32:19,890
Thank you.

2612
02:32:22,310 --> 02:32:23,410
Thank you, thank you.

2613
02:32:23,710 --> 02:32:24,390
I hope you too.

2614
02:32:26,910 --> 02:32:27,990
Oh my gosh, it's been a while.

2615
02:32:28,070 --> 02:32:30,070
Wait, it's been a while since I've seen you sideways.

2616
02:32:30,690 --> 02:32:30,970
Hello.

2617
02:32:36,590 --> 02:32:38,270
Her hatred makes her stronger.

2618
02:32:43,230 --> 02:32:44,030
Well, what else?

2619
02:32:44,410 --> 02:32:47,630
There was like that science thing someone mentioned earlier.

2620
02:32:47,830 --> 02:32:50,430
Any other anime if you guys are watching this season?

2621
02:32:52,250 --> 02:32:53,250
Anything else?

2622
02:32:59,530 --> 02:33:04,930
Maybe I... I know I need to watch ReZero, it's just getting through the hour and a half long episode.

2623
02:33:05,250 --> 02:33:05,850
First episode.

2624
02:33:11,690 --> 02:33:12,890
Tower of God?

2625
02:33:16,090 --> 02:33:17,710
Wasn't that a webtoon?

2626
02:33:17,970 --> 02:33:18,670
Or am I crazy?

2627
02:33:21,410 --> 02:33:22,470
Oh, nice!

2628
02:33:22,610 --> 02:33:23,130
We got it.

2629
02:33:26,290 --> 02:33:27,330
It was.

2630
02:33:27,930 --> 02:33:28,450
Right?

2631
02:33:28,610 --> 02:33:28,830
Yeah.

2632
02:33:33,940 --> 02:33:34,800
Oh my god.

2633
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:39,100
The head is not... The hair is not attached to the head?

2634
02:33:40,060 --> 02:33:41,840
Why is the head not a complete thing?

2635
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:48,440
Yakuza fiance?

2636
02:33:49,360 --> 02:33:51,000
That sounds so up my alley.

2637
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:55,340
Wait, is it like a cute romance show?

2638
02:33:57,760 --> 02:34:00,000
Because if so...

2639
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:07,500
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be weird.

2640
02:34:11,470 --> 02:34:12,630
Shoujo AF?

2641
02:34:14,110 --> 02:34:17,270
I've been really wanting a good shoujo anime recently.

2642
02:34:19,650 --> 02:34:24,470
I suppose you may be wondering why I didn't go to rescue my betrothed personally.

2643
02:34:25,830 --> 02:34:27,210
Here it is, here it is.

2644
02:34:29,770 --> 02:34:30,890
Yes, Farquaad.

2645
02:34:31,890 --> 02:34:32,070
Why?

2646
02:34:34,030 --> 02:34:39,990
I would have of course had I not scheduled the quest to commence on the same day as my official crown fitting.

2647
02:34:41,150 --> 02:34:42,030
I see.

2648
02:34:44,750 --> 02:34:46,670
So maybe I should go.

2649
02:34:52,040 --> 02:34:54,960
Why isn't my afterlife a shoujo anime?

2650
02:34:56,620 --> 02:34:57,820
Not quite.

2651
02:34:59,880 --> 02:35:02,160
I've been busy with work and the gym.

2652
02:35:02,460 --> 02:35:05,040
I finally got back down under 200 pounds and dropping.

2653
02:35:05,180 --> 02:35:05,700
Oh my god!

2654
02:35:06,200 --> 02:35:09,500
I'm incredibly happy about it, hoping I can get to 160 so I can cosplay again.

2655
02:35:10,220 --> 02:35:10,820
Wow!

2656
02:35:12,280 --> 02:35:13,280
Look at you go!

2657
02:35:14,340 --> 02:35:14,920
Congrats.

2658
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:18,980
Holy cow.

2659
02:35:19,420 --> 02:35:20,020
Motivation.

2660
02:35:20,840 --> 02:35:22,220
Mental gains.

2661
02:35:30,920 --> 02:35:33,640
Okay, Lord Farquaad, was that it?

2662
02:35:34,380 --> 02:35:35,980
Was that seriously it?

2663
02:35:40,770 --> 02:35:43,990
Let me out of here!

2664
02:35:44,810 --> 02:35:46,290
Let me out, please!

2665
02:35:48,250 --> 02:35:50,010
What a tease.

2666
02:35:51,310 --> 02:35:53,610
Oh my god, not in the good way.

2667
02:35:55,470 --> 02:35:56,350
Please.

2668
02:35:57,770 --> 02:35:58,930
Let me out.

2669
02:36:01,010 --> 02:36:02,330
Click the Shrek button?

2670
02:36:02,790 --> 02:36:03,350
This one?

2671
02:36:03,850 --> 02:36:05,790
But it only leads me to this place.

2672
02:36:13,450 --> 02:36:14,390
Six minutes already?

2673
02:36:14,530 --> 02:36:15,990
Oh my gosh, Nicholas, thank you!

2674
02:36:16,470 --> 02:36:17,950
I need to show up more often.

2675
02:36:21,510 --> 02:36:24,070
What are you guys abandoning me for?

2676
02:36:24,230 --> 02:36:24,690
Click new?

2677
02:36:25,010 --> 02:36:25,970
Wait, what do you mean new?

2678
02:36:31,270 --> 02:36:32,370
Oh, wait.

2679
02:36:43,060 --> 02:36:44,220
Was I up in there the whole time?

2680
02:36:57,060 --> 02:36:57,540
Yes?

2681
02:36:58,140 --> 02:36:58,520
No.

2682
02:36:59,880 --> 02:37:01,080
Don't look at that part.

2683
02:37:01,220 --> 02:37:03,360
It kind of looks like the city has been burned a little bit, huh?

2684
02:37:04,420 --> 02:37:05,660
Here, we'll do this angle.

2685
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:08,780
We'll do this angle.

2686
02:37:10,340 --> 02:37:14,860
Time for some karaoke on top of a scaffolding.

2687
02:37:17,060 --> 02:37:17,860
Don't jump.

2688
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:19,660
What if I did?

2689
02:37:25,600 --> 02:37:27,060
What if I did?

2690
02:37:30,280 --> 02:37:31,240
Just kidding.

2691
02:37:35,580 --> 02:37:36,180
OK

2692
02:37:39,660 --> 02:37:40,920
What should I sing?

2693
02:37:42,880 --> 02:37:44,660
What should I sing first?

2694
02:38:01,130 --> 02:38:02,330
Yeah, I'm a ghost guys.

2695
02:38:02,330 --> 02:38:02,950
I can flow.

2696
02:38:03,050 --> 02:38:04,950
All Star or...

2697
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:06,730
All Star.

2698
02:38:07,070 --> 02:38:07,650
Oh, sorry.

2699
02:38:19,700 --> 02:38:20,940
Smash Mouth.

2700
02:38:22,500 --> 02:38:26,700
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me.

2701
02:38:26,980 --> 02:38:29,920
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.

2702
02:38:30,900 --> 02:38:39,220
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an L on her forehead.

2703
02:38:40,320 --> 02:38:43,160
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming.

2704
02:38:43,360 --> 02:38:45,480
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.

2705
02:38:45,480 --> 02:38:47,760
Didn't make sense not to live for fun.

2706
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:50,100
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.

2707
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:52,020
So much to do, so much to see.

2708
02:38:52,120 --> 02:38:54,440
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

2709
02:38:54,740 --> 02:38:56,640
You'll never know if you don't go up.

2710
02:38:56,880 --> 02:38:58,740
You'll never shine if you don't glow.

2711
02:38:59,560 --> 02:39:01,360
Hey now, you're an all star.

2712
02:39:01,620 --> 02:39:03,940
Get your game on, go play.

2713
02:39:04,120 --> 02:39:06,020
Hey now, you're a rock star.

2714
02:39:06,280 --> 02:39:08,500
Get the show on, get paid.

2715
02:39:08,900 --> 02:39:11,780
All that glitters is gold.

2716
02:39:11,780 --> 02:39:16,080
All these shooting stars break the mold.

2717
02:39:17,460 --> 02:39:20,120
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder.

2718
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:22,360
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older.

2719
02:39:22,440 --> 02:39:24,120
But the media men beg to differ.

2720
02:39:24,420 --> 02:39:26,380
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture.

2721
02:39:26,680 --> 02:39:28,680
Ice we skate is getting pretty thin.

2722
02:39:28,900 --> 02:39:30,960
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim.

2723
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:33,320
My world's on fire, how about yours?

2724
02:39:33,480 --> 02:39:35,700
That's the way I like it and I never get bored.

2725
02:39:36,560 --> 02:39:38,240
Hey now, you're an all star.

2726
02:39:38,540 --> 02:39:40,780
Get your game on, go play.

2727
02:39:40,780 --> 02:39:43,080
Hey now, you're a rock star.

2728
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:44,860
Get the show on, get paid.

2729
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:48,280
All that glitters is gold.

2730
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:53,000
All these shooting stars break the mold.

2731
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:03,960
Wait, I want to do this in front of another location.

2732
02:40:08,940 --> 02:40:10,020
Right in front.

2733
02:40:10,100 --> 02:40:10,880
Oh, don't look at that side.

2734
02:40:10,980 --> 02:40:11,920
There we go.

2735
02:40:12,980 --> 02:40:15,240
Hey now, you're an all star.

2736
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:17,760
Get your game on, go play.

2737
02:40:17,940 --> 02:40:19,840
Hey now, you're a rock star.

2738
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:22,340
Get the show on, get paid.

2739
02:40:22,760 --> 02:40:25,200
All that glitters is gold.

2740
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:28,520
All these shooting stars.

2741
02:40:29,360 --> 02:40:33,480
Somebody once asked me could I spare some change for gas.

2742
02:40:33,660 --> 02:40:37,000
I need to get myself away from this place.

2743
02:40:37,860 --> 02:40:40,240
I said yep, what a concept.

2744
02:40:40,520 --> 02:40:47,040
I could use a little fuel for myself and we could all use a little change.

2745
02:40:47,400 --> 02:40:50,180
Well, the year's back coming and they don't stop coming.

2746
02:40:50,460 --> 02:40:52,400
Bent to the rules and I hit the ground running.

2747
02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:54,600
Didn't make sense not to live for fun.

2748
02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:56,940
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.

2749
02:40:57,220 --> 02:40:58,900
So much to do, so much to see.

2750
02:40:59,020 --> 02:41:01,260
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

2751
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:03,320
You'll never know if you don't go.

2752
02:41:03,700 --> 02:41:05,740
You'll never shine if you don't glow.

2753
02:41:05,740 --> 02:41:08,400
Hey now, you're an old star.

2754
02:41:08,520 --> 02:41:09,420
Could you give up?

2755
02:41:09,740 --> 02:41:10,800
Go play.

2756
02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:12,900
Hey now, you're a rock star.

2757
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:14,920
Get the show on, get paid.

2758
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:18,620
All that glitters is gold.

2759
02:41:19,120 --> 02:41:21,140
All these shooting stars.

2760
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:22,940
Break the mold.

2761
02:41:24,780 --> 02:41:27,540
All that glitters is gold.

2762
02:41:28,420 --> 02:41:30,100
All these shooting stars.

2763
02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:32,240
Break the mold.

2764
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:38,600
Yeah!

2765
02:41:39,820 --> 02:41:40,740
Yeah.

2766
02:41:42,020 --> 02:41:45,060
What if I just search Shrek?

2767
02:41:53,070 --> 02:41:53,750
Here we go.

2768
02:41:59,390 --> 02:42:05,840
Love was only true in fairy tales.

2769
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:10,480
Meant for someone else but not for me.

2770
02:42:12,660 --> 02:42:14,980
Love was out to get me.

2771
02:42:15,980 --> 02:42:17,800
Not the way it seems.

2772
02:42:19,280 --> 02:42:23,100
Disappointment haunted all my dreams.

2773
02:42:23,420 --> 02:42:25,220
And then I saw her face.

2774
02:42:26,360 --> 02:42:27,900
Now I'm a believer.

2775
02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:30,980
Not a trace.

2776
02:42:32,200 --> 02:42:34,020
Of doubt in my mind.

2777
02:42:35,580 --> 02:42:36,560
I'm in love.

2778
02:42:37,960 --> 02:42:42,510
I'm a believer if I try.

2779
02:42:43,430 --> 02:42:44,390
Right guys?

2780
02:42:44,390 --> 02:42:49,510
I thought love was more or less a given thing.

2781
02:42:49,790 --> 02:42:53,910
I'm a free giver but the more I gave the less I got.

2782
02:42:54,110 --> 02:42:55,550
Oh yeah.

2783
02:42:56,830 --> 02:42:58,590
What's the use in trying?

2784
02:42:59,430 --> 02:43:01,630
All you get is pain.

2785
02:43:02,450 --> 02:43:06,110
When I wanted sunshine I got rain.

2786
02:43:07,050 --> 02:43:08,870
And then I saw her face.

2787
02:43:09,890 --> 02:43:11,630
Now I'm a believer.

2788
02:43:12,990 --> 02:43:14,670
Not a trace.

2789
02:43:15,990 --> 02:43:18,030
Of doubt in my mind.

2790
02:43:19,330 --> 02:43:20,270
I'm in love.

2791
02:43:21,690 --> 02:43:23,190
I'm a believer.

2792
02:43:23,710 --> 02:43:27,110
I couldn't leave her if I tried.

2793
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:33,030
You guys believe in ghosts, yeah?

2794
02:43:33,030 --> 02:43:38,050
Da, da, da, da, da, da.

2795
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:42,280
What's the use in trying?

2796
02:43:43,180 --> 02:43:45,140
All you get is pain.

2797
02:43:46,180 --> 02:43:49,700
When I wanted sunshine I got rain.

2798
02:43:50,780 --> 02:43:52,680
And then I saw her face.

2799
02:43:53,740 --> 02:43:56,420
Now I'm a believer in ghosts.

2800
02:43:57,020 --> 02:43:58,320
Not a trace.

2801
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:01,200
Of doubt in my mind.

2802
02:44:01,260 --> 02:44:02,440
I believe in the paranormal.

2803
02:44:02,440 --> 02:44:04,020
I'm in love.

2804
02:44:05,460 --> 02:44:06,900
I'm a believer.

2805
02:44:07,280 --> 02:44:10,600
I couldn't leave her if I tried.

2806
02:44:11,380 --> 02:44:15,930
Then I saw her face.

2807
02:44:16,890 --> 02:44:18,590
Now I'm a believer.

2808
02:44:20,090 --> 02:44:22,310
Not a trace.

2809
02:44:22,950 --> 02:44:24,810
Of doubt in my mind.

2810
02:44:26,090 --> 02:44:28,770
Now I'm a believer, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2811
02:44:31,960 --> 02:44:33,160
Now I'm a believer.

2812
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:36,280
And then I saw her face.

2813
02:44:40,430 --> 02:44:41,930
I'm a believer.

2814
02:44:46,220 --> 02:44:48,100
Not a trace.

2815
02:44:51,700 --> 02:44:53,740
Of doubt in my mind.

2816
02:44:58,340 --> 02:44:59,440
Now I'm a believer.

2817
02:45:13,440 --> 02:45:14,180
OK,

2818
02:45:17,740 --> 02:45:18,820
I got another song.

2819
02:45:21,440 --> 02:45:23,120
I'll zoom out a little bit.

2820
02:45:23,740 --> 02:45:24,060
Sorry.

2821
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:24,820
C minor.

2822
02:45:24,900 --> 02:45:25,640
Put in C minor.

2823
02:45:26,020 --> 02:45:26,220
Oh.

2824
02:45:27,280 --> 02:45:30,620
Where are all the good men gone?

2825
02:45:30,920 --> 02:45:34,100
And where are all the gods?

2826
02:45:35,440 --> 02:45:43,760
Where's the streetwise Hercules To fight the rising odds?

2827
02:45:44,720 --> 02:45:52,660
Isn't there a white knight Upon a fiery steed?

2828
02:45:53,080 --> 02:46:02,420
Late at night, I toss and I turn And I dream of what I need.

2829
02:46:03,720 --> 02:46:05,220
Kick it, boys!

2830
02:46:05,940 --> 02:46:09,420
I need a hero.

2831
02:46:10,380 --> 02:46:14,000
I'm holding out for a hero Till the end of the night.

2832
02:46:14,720 --> 02:46:16,060
He's gotta be fast.

2833
02:46:16,100 --> 02:46:17,660
Strong, he's gotta be fast.

2834
02:46:17,660 --> 02:46:20,560
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight.

2835
02:46:20,840 --> 02:46:22,240
I need a hero.

2836
02:46:23,080 --> 02:46:26,820
I'm holding out for a hero Till the morning light.

2837
02:46:27,160 --> 02:46:28,900
He's gotta be sure.

2838
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:30,580
And he's gotta be soon.

2839
02:46:30,700 --> 02:46:33,120
And he's gotta be larger than life.

2840
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:36,080
Larger than life.

2841
02:46:47,180 --> 02:47:12,560
Somewhere after midnight In my wildest fantasy Somewhere just beyond my reach There's someone reaching back for me Racing on the thunder And rising with the heat It's gonna take a superman To sweep me off my feet

2842
02:47:24,010 --> 02:47:26,870
Up where the mountains meet the heavens above.

2843
02:47:27,470 --> 02:47:30,170
Out where the lightning splits the sea.

2844
02:47:30,730 --> 02:47:34,990
I swear that there is someone somewhere watching me.

2845
02:47:35,270 --> 02:47:36,370
I forgot this part, whoops.

2846
02:47:37,110 --> 02:47:39,950
Through the wind and the chill and the rain.

2847
02:47:40,170 --> 02:47:42,610
And the storm and the blood.

2848
02:47:43,390 --> 02:47:47,710
I can feel his approach like fire in my blood.

2849
02:47:48,150 --> 02:47:49,170
I don't remember that part.

2850
02:47:49,170 --> 02:47:54,590
Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood.

2851
02:48:07,630 --> 02:48:09,070
I wonder if you could mix here.

2852
02:48:14,780 --> 02:48:15,900
Ok, nevermind.

2853
02:48:21,160 --> 02:48:22,840
This isn't a karaoke stream.

2854
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:28,680
I need a hero.

2855
02:48:29,540 --> 02:48:33,280
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light.

2856
02:48:33,680 --> 02:48:36,920
And he's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon.

2857
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:40,260
And he's gotta be larger than life.

2858
02:48:50,740 --> 02:48:53,420
I gotta get a new home to escape.

2859
02:48:53,960 --> 02:48:54,760
Wipe out.

2860
02:48:55,180 --> 02:48:57,000
Oh no, the tempo changed.

2861
02:49:07,460 --> 02:49:11,320
Oh he's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast.

2862
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:13,820
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight.

2863
02:49:14,440 --> 02:49:15,760
I need a hero.

2864
02:49:17,340 --> 02:49:17,660
Hero.

2865
02:49:18,200 --> 02:49:19,080
Wait a second, hold on.

2866
02:49:19,140 --> 02:49:19,900
We go back in time.

2867
02:49:20,680 --> 02:49:21,320
No, no, no, no.

2868
02:49:21,340 --> 02:49:21,920
Do it again.

2869
02:49:23,740 --> 02:49:24,360
Do it again.

2870
02:49:26,260 --> 02:49:26,900
Here, here, here.

2871
02:49:26,920 --> 02:49:27,240
Hold on.

2872
02:49:31,260 --> 02:49:31,800
I skipped it.

2873
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:34,080
Ok, hold on.

2874
02:49:35,100 --> 02:49:35,740
My blood.

2875
02:49:45,760 --> 02:49:48,100
I have something to say.

2876
02:49:49,260 --> 02:49:51,440
Shrek is cute.

2877
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:55,140
I like him, I like him, I like him, I like him.

2878
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:57,800
I finally found my prince.

2879
02:49:58,680 --> 02:50:00,440
The reason I was born.

2880
02:50:01,780 --> 02:50:03,540
To meet Shrek.

2881
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:07,480
Let's live our lives together.

2882
02:50:08,080 --> 02:50:10,960
I love you the most in the world.

2883
02:50:11,220 --> 02:50:13,140
I love you.

2884
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:16,900
I need a hero.

2885
02:50:17,260 --> 02:50:17,920
It works!

2886
02:50:18,220 --> 02:50:21,600
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light.

2887
02:50:22,280 --> 02:50:25,280
And he's gotta be sure and he's gotta be safe.

2888
02:50:25,480 --> 02:50:27,940
And he's gotta be larger than life.

2889
02:50:28,280 --> 02:50:29,480
It works!

2890
02:50:41,900 --> 02:50:43,100
Pan Matsuri!

2891
02:50:44,300 --> 02:50:48,540
And you can do the Pokemon Pan right there too.

2892
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:48,580
Thank you.

2893
02:51:07,190 --> 02:51:08,610
Shrek's Onion Matsuri.

2894
02:51:10,530 --> 02:51:14,830
I can't believe you can Gachikoi Kojo in the middle of holding out for a hero.

2895
02:51:15,770 --> 02:51:17,410
Oh no, it's playing it again.

2896
02:51:17,550 --> 02:51:17,950
No, no, no.

2897
02:51:21,290 --> 02:51:21,770
Alright.

2898
02:51:26,020 --> 02:51:27,180
Let's go to the next place.

2899
02:51:28,160 --> 02:51:31,720
Let's go to the next place and I might... What other songs are in Shrek?

2900
02:51:35,140 --> 02:51:36,140
What other songs?

2901
02:51:42,540 --> 02:51:43,500
Minto Believer.

2902
02:51:43,780 --> 02:51:44,460
Thank you Poki.

2903
02:51:48,700 --> 02:51:49,720
Accidentally in Love.

2904
02:51:51,400 --> 02:51:52,320
What is that one?

2905
02:51:52,540 --> 02:51:53,820
Living La Vida Loca!

2906
02:51:55,380 --> 02:51:57,620
Okay, we'll sing those when we get to the next place.

2907
02:51:57,620 --> 02:52:00,420
Or let me do a little bit of the next area.

2908
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:01,880
New.

2909
02:52:03,460 --> 02:52:06,360
Hanzo's Honeymoon Hideaway.

2910
02:52:22,380 --> 02:52:24,520
Oh no, this is disgusting.

2911
02:52:24,520 --> 02:52:27,920
Mud baths by fairy light.

2912
02:52:28,280 --> 02:52:29,260
Picnics by the sea.

2913
02:52:29,580 --> 02:52:30,960
Banishments by angry villagers.

2914
02:52:31,320 --> 02:52:31,940
Pure bliss.

2915
02:52:32,640 --> 02:52:35,920
We're cleaning up their aftermath of their honeymoon?

2916
02:52:38,940 --> 02:52:47,980
But time flies when you're having fun and now that we're due to check out the love goggles have come off and I can see the mess we've made.

2917
02:52:47,980 --> 02:53:02,400
Shrek's Not Bothered says anyone renting out their place to a pair of loved up ogres is asking for trouble.

2918
02:53:02,800 --> 02:53:03,680
But I disagree.

2919
02:53:20,340 --> 02:53:21,960
On the heart?

2920
02:53:23,560 --> 02:53:24,120
Oh my god.

2921
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:43,260
Oh my god.

2922
02:53:43,520 --> 02:53:45,280
Am I wearing... I'm wearing gloves, right?

2923
02:53:47,880 --> 02:53:50,040
We don't go inside.

2924
02:53:52,160 --> 02:53:53,360
But even the...

2925
02:53:59,180 --> 02:54:02,360
What are you doing in my...

2926
02:54:04,840 --> 02:54:06,000
In your what?

2927
02:54:07,060 --> 02:54:08,320
Oh my god, get rid of it, please.

2928
02:54:08,500 --> 02:54:08,840
Get rid of it.

2929
02:54:08,880 --> 02:54:09,280
Get rid of it.

2930
02:54:09,320 --> 02:54:09,720
Get rid of it.

2931
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:10,120
Get rid of it.

2932
02:54:10,180 --> 02:54:10,540
Get rid of it.

2933
02:54:10,580 --> 02:54:10,900
Get rid of it.

2934
02:54:10,980 --> 02:54:11,540
I don't want to know.

2935
02:54:11,640 --> 02:54:12,580
I don't want... Get rid of it.

2936
02:54:12,600 --> 02:54:12,920
Get rid of it.

2937
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:13,440
Get rid of it.

2938
02:54:13,800 --> 02:54:14,560
Get rid of it.

2939
02:54:15,480 --> 02:54:17,380
Alright, we're not at the swamp, are we?

2940
02:54:17,620 --> 02:54:17,800
Why?

2941
02:54:17,860 --> 02:54:18,700
Do you want me to be there, Shrek?

2942
02:54:19,660 --> 02:54:20,540
I'll leave right now.

2943
02:54:20,640 --> 02:54:22,580
Shrek and Fiona freaking out.

2944
02:54:24,440 --> 02:54:26,200
Wait, is it really... Did it really appear?

2945
02:54:26,940 --> 02:54:27,860
No, not yet.

2946
02:54:30,160 --> 02:54:32,920
This is where... This is how Shrek 3 happens.

2947
02:54:34,120 --> 02:54:34,360
Guys!

2948
02:54:38,700 --> 02:54:40,340
Beware the love onion.

2949
02:54:40,640 --> 02:54:42,440
Oh my god.

2950
02:54:43,740 --> 02:54:48,100
Oh my god, but this level is so much more doable to get to the swamp.

2951
02:54:48,860 --> 02:54:49,200
You know?

2952
02:54:52,100 --> 02:54:55,460
Why do they start you off with the largest level ever?

2953
02:55:08,240 --> 02:55:10,620
No wonder Fiona had three babies!

2954
02:55:11,940 --> 02:55:12,540
Stop.

2955
02:55:15,080 --> 02:55:17,580
I wish them a happy lifetime.

2956
02:55:18,300 --> 02:55:20,160
This isn't even place number one.

2957
02:55:20,240 --> 02:55:21,200
It's place number two.

2958
02:55:25,980 --> 02:55:28,860
Also, why is Shrek texting me about this place?

2959
02:55:28,880 --> 02:55:29,740
He doesn't own it?

2960
02:55:30,920 --> 02:55:32,700
Oh my gosh, it's so beautiful here though.

2961
02:55:33,360 --> 02:55:34,640
What is it called?

2962
02:55:50,130 --> 02:55:50,650
Mintz...

2963
02:55:51,510 --> 02:55:52,430
Hentai Haven.

2964
02:55:54,570 --> 02:55:55,370
Hentai... Heaven.

2965
02:55:55,370 --> 02:55:55,490
Heaven.

2966
02:55:58,140 --> 02:55:59,890
That's what the HH stands for.

2967
02:56:02,040 --> 02:56:03,210
The freak shack.

2968
02:56:12,600 --> 02:56:15,880
Hansel and Gretel's...

2969
02:56:17,900 --> 02:56:20,500
Oh, honey... Oh, Han... Not just... Nope, sorry.

2970
02:56:20,920 --> 02:56:22,880
Gretel does not get any...

2971
02:56:23,440 --> 02:56:24,680
Any credit.

2972
02:56:24,860 --> 02:56:27,460
Just Hansel's honeymoon hideaway.

2973
02:56:27,940 --> 02:56:28,660
The HHH.

2974
02:56:32,670 --> 02:56:34,110
Can you see?

2975
02:56:34,350 --> 02:56:37,190
Oh, you guys want to go to Mintz Hentai Heaven?

2976
02:56:39,870 --> 02:56:44,230
Well, first of all, it's very expensive and exclusive.

2977
02:56:52,270 --> 02:56:56,970
It's not really for anybody to just wander into, you know?

2978
02:56:58,550 --> 02:57:01,450
You gotta be really... You gotta be invited and stuff.

2979
02:57:01,770 --> 02:57:02,750
I have cash.

2980
02:57:05,090 --> 02:57:06,730
But do you have nerve?

2981
02:57:07,350 --> 02:57:10,710
Do you have... Do you have the strength?

2982
02:57:11,990 --> 02:57:13,850
Do you have the mental fortitude?

2983
02:57:22,950 --> 02:57:26,510
Have you guys ever watched hentai and then... Well, not just hentai.

2984
02:57:26,790 --> 02:57:28,730
But also like, you know, jav.

2985
02:57:29,050 --> 02:57:30,970
And then put them on like 2x speed.

2986
02:57:32,630 --> 02:57:35,770
But then also put them on 0.5x speed and they sound like a seal.

2987
02:57:37,590 --> 02:57:38,350
They're like...

2988
02:57:44,930 --> 02:57:46,250
Try it next time.

2989
02:57:46,650 --> 02:57:47,430
Can we leave here?

2990
02:57:47,550 --> 02:57:47,810
No.

2991
02:57:49,070 --> 02:57:51,330
Oh my gosh, it looks like broccoli in the distance.

2992
02:57:52,850 --> 02:57:54,610
Oh my gosh, there's the other hideaways!

2993
02:58:03,420 --> 02:58:05,340
It's just silliness, you know, when you do it.

2994
02:58:09,960 --> 02:58:11,940
It's just kind of a fun activity, you know?

2995
02:58:16,710 --> 02:58:19,370
I have half a McDouble and a used Q-tip.

2996
02:58:20,070 --> 02:58:21,030
Oh, I'm so hungry.

2997
02:58:21,490 --> 02:58:22,290
Fine, you're in.

2998
02:58:25,790 --> 02:58:26,830
Access granted.

2999
02:58:27,210 --> 02:58:29,090
Honestly, you could pay me off with food.

3000
02:58:29,430 --> 02:58:30,270
Especially right now.

3001
02:58:35,500 --> 02:58:36,760
Why is it dripping?

3002
02:58:37,320 --> 02:58:38,120
Why is it dripping?

3003
02:58:38,440 --> 02:58:39,160
Why is it dripping?

3004
02:58:41,060 --> 02:58:42,800
Oh my god.

3005
02:58:43,380 --> 02:58:45,380
I walked into Min talking about hentai and jav.

3006
02:58:45,380 --> 02:58:51,380
No, I'm saying, you know, it's silly if you listen to it at 0.5x speed...

3007
02:58:52,060 --> 02:58:53,000
And they sound like a seal.

3008
02:58:54,200 --> 02:58:54,600
You know?

3009
02:58:55,320 --> 02:58:56,760
They're like...

3010
02:58:59,940 --> 02:59:02,420
Hey, Oshi puts the Oshi in fujoshi.

3011
02:59:16,690 --> 02:59:18,430
You'll never unhear it, I promise.

3012
02:59:18,430 --> 02:59:22,710
Actually, don't do it if you don't want to ruin your experience, I guess.

3013
02:59:30,590 --> 02:59:32,410
This place is making me hungry.

3014
02:59:34,430 --> 02:59:37,290
The gingerbread house is so yummy looking.

3015
02:59:42,840 --> 02:59:44,960
We will forsake our countries.

3016
02:59:45,280 --> 02:59:47,040
We will leave our motherlands.

3017
02:59:47,400 --> 02:59:48,940
We have no nation.

3018
02:59:49,300 --> 02:59:50,200
No philosophy.

3019
02:59:50,580 --> 02:59:51,480
No ideology.

3020
02:59:51,860 --> 02:59:53,180
It is our only home.

3021
02:59:53,900 --> 02:59:55,180
Our heaven and our hell.

3022
02:59:55,180 --> 02:59:57,320
This is hentai haven.

3023
02:59:58,120 --> 02:59:59,720
Mint big freak phantom.

3024
03:00:05,560 --> 03:00:06,100
Perfect.

3025
03:00:06,720 --> 03:00:07,820
The perfect speech.

3026
03:00:15,140 --> 03:00:18,280
Honestly, that speech lives, like, so rent-free in my brain.

3027
03:00:18,940 --> 03:00:21,820
I mean, anything Metal Gear lives rent-free in my brain.

3028
03:00:21,900 --> 03:00:23,120
Who am I kidding?

3029
03:00:25,140 --> 03:00:28,580
I can't tell if these are dirty or if they're...

3030
03:00:28,580 --> 03:00:29,720
Oh no, they're just speckled.

3031
03:00:30,600 --> 03:00:32,000
What can you eat this place?

3032
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,180
Do you think you're allowed to?

3033
03:00:44,880 --> 03:00:46,340
Would you want to now?

3034
03:00:46,720 --> 03:00:48,720
I'm cleaning it.

3035
03:00:49,880 --> 03:00:52,540
This is multi-purpose and it's huge.

3036
03:00:52,700 --> 03:00:54,520
I'm just gonna use the...

3037
03:00:54,520 --> 03:00:55,340
Soap.

3038
03:00:59,100 --> 03:01:00,560
Let me know...

3039
03:01:00,560 --> 03:01:01,980
Oh, I don't know why you're bothering.

3040
03:01:02,100 --> 03:01:03,380
The place looks fine to me.

3041
03:01:04,560 --> 03:01:05,020
Shrek.

3042
03:01:07,240 --> 03:01:08,760
Shrek is just like...

3043
03:01:10,280 --> 03:01:12,080
Anybody wants to...

3044
03:01:12,080 --> 03:01:15,020
Anybody would, you know, see this and get turned on.

3045
03:01:15,380 --> 03:01:18,480
Although there might be the odd blob of snot.

3046
03:01:19,280 --> 03:01:20,800
It feels kind of cozy.

3047
03:01:23,480 --> 03:01:24,120
Alright.

3048
03:01:25,500 --> 03:01:26,260
The snot.

3049
03:01:27,240 --> 03:01:28,620
It's the snot.

3050
03:01:30,660 --> 03:01:31,300
Wait,

3051
03:01:49,590 --> 03:01:50,810
there's something written on the roof.

3052
03:01:53,840 --> 03:01:55,080
What does it say?

3053
03:01:57,440 --> 03:01:58,600
T.T.

3054
03:01:59,020 --> 03:02:00,660
T.T.T.T.

3055
03:02:00,860 --> 03:02:01,820
What does it mean?

3056
03:02:02,520 --> 03:02:03,560
Maybe Cortex is gifted!

3057
03:02:09,450 --> 03:02:10,710
It says mint?

3058
03:02:11,070 --> 03:02:12,230
No, it doesn't.

3059
03:02:15,940 --> 03:02:17,450
But we can make it say mint.

3060
03:03:00,560 --> 03:03:02,260
Hold on, I have to write something else.

3061
03:03:06,520 --> 03:03:08,360
It provides ghostly energy?

3062
03:03:08,360 --> 03:03:09,380
Experience?

3063
03:03:09,760 --> 03:03:10,280
Wait, what did you say?

3064
03:03:10,620 --> 03:03:11,140
Thank you!

3065
03:03:15,900 --> 03:03:17,820
Hold on, I have to write more.

3066
03:03:19,440 --> 03:03:20,440
I have to...

3067
03:03:20,440 --> 03:03:22,880
I have to clear my name.

3068
03:03:24,240 --> 03:03:24,640
Hold on.

3069
03:03:25,220 --> 03:03:26,360
Oh gosh.

3070
03:03:26,740 --> 03:03:27,340
I'm stuck.

3071
03:03:27,760 --> 03:03:28,300
Okay, hold on.

3072
03:04:03,820 --> 03:04:05,720
But this freak was not me!

3073
03:04:08,760 --> 03:04:09,280
This...

3074
03:04:09,280 --> 03:04:11,300
This freakiness was not me!

3075
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:12,940
Freak Mint was here!

3076
03:04:14,120 --> 03:04:16,040
Freaky Mint was here, but this freak...

3077
03:04:16,040 --> 03:04:17,480
I do not take credit for this.

3078
03:04:20,940 --> 03:04:22,540
I don't take credit for this.

3079
03:04:27,810 --> 03:04:28,290
Yeah.

3080
03:04:30,670 --> 03:04:32,930
Two freak, five me.

3081
03:04:34,010 --> 03:04:34,690
Oh wait.

3082
03:04:35,490 --> 03:04:36,170
There we go.

3083
03:04:40,520 --> 03:04:41,500
Bing, bing, bing, bing.

3084
03:04:41,620 --> 03:04:44,680
I love the sound of money, baby.

3085
03:04:44,680 --> 03:04:45,200
We...

3086
03:04:47,380 --> 03:04:48,360
We love it.

3087
03:04:48,400 --> 03:04:49,580
We love to hear it.

3088
03:04:50,220 --> 03:04:52,260
We love to hear it.

3089
03:04:53,080 --> 03:04:54,260
Even on the insides.

3090
03:04:54,360 --> 03:04:56,020
They just left no surface untouched.

3091
03:04:57,500 --> 03:04:58,400
Nowhere is safe.

3092
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:00,280
Incredible.

3093
03:05:01,380 --> 03:05:02,380
Oh my gosh.

3094
03:05:02,520 --> 03:05:03,360
I wonder if there...

3095
03:05:03,360 --> 03:05:07,300
Actually, there are ogres in the milking farm universe.

3096
03:05:08,740 --> 03:05:09,320
So...

3097
03:05:09,320 --> 03:05:11,260
Maybe they need an ogre farm.

3098
03:05:11,700 --> 03:05:12,260
I don't know.

3099
03:05:12,520 --> 03:05:13,300
Just a suggestion.

3100
03:05:16,020 --> 03:05:17,180
Cha-ching, baby.

3101
03:05:17,320 --> 03:05:18,140
Thanks for the coin.

3102
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:20,020
Thanks for the super chat.

3103
03:05:23,340 --> 03:05:24,220
Thank you, thank you.

3104
03:05:25,240 --> 03:05:27,280
Please don't reward me for my words, though.

3105
03:05:28,180 --> 03:05:30,340
You guys make me feel bad when I say bad things.

3106
03:05:30,620 --> 03:05:32,300
And then you reward me for them.

3107
03:05:32,760 --> 03:05:33,840
I feel quite guilty.

3108
03:05:34,180 --> 03:05:34,940
Don't do that.

3109
03:05:38,580 --> 03:05:38,980
Okay.

3110
03:05:38,980 --> 03:05:39,080
Okay.

3111
03:05:45,680 --> 03:05:46,060
I know.

3112
03:05:46,620 --> 03:05:48,840
I know sometimes I say things that shouldn't be said.

3113
03:05:49,460 --> 03:05:49,720
Okay.

3114
03:05:51,560 --> 03:05:52,640
So it's our fault now.

3115
03:05:52,740 --> 03:05:53,520
No, no, no!

3116
03:05:54,380 --> 03:05:55,400
That's not what I said.

3117
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,400
I'm just saying, don't reward me.

3118
03:06:02,340 --> 03:06:04,140
I think you should get worse.

3119
03:06:05,180 --> 03:06:05,660
Really?

3120
03:06:06,280 --> 03:06:07,200
I could.

3121
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:10,740
I could get way worse.

3122
03:06:26,480 --> 03:06:27,720
Thanks for the super chat.

3123
03:06:33,120 --> 03:06:34,520
Maybe another day.

3124
03:06:34,840 --> 03:06:36,040
And I'm feeling a little more freaky.

3125
03:06:38,060 --> 03:06:40,760
I mean, this place is freaky.

3126
03:06:40,900 --> 03:06:42,780
This place has it all covered, everybody.

3127
03:06:43,240 --> 03:06:44,560
I mean, it is covered.

3128
03:06:44,880 --> 03:06:49,200
But it has all the freakiness handled, rather.

3129
03:06:49,200 --> 03:06:50,380
You know?

3130
03:06:50,560 --> 03:06:51,920
I don't need to do anything else.

3131
03:06:53,980 --> 03:06:56,280
Time to go all in on the freaky.

3132
03:06:56,940 --> 03:06:57,740
Oh my gosh.

3133
03:06:58,520 --> 03:06:59,640
What's wrong with you guys?

3134
03:07:00,420 --> 03:07:01,720
You guys need to calm down.

3135
03:07:02,080 --> 03:07:04,080
You're dirty dogs out here.

3136
03:07:04,160 --> 03:07:04,860
You're all dogs.

3137
03:07:05,600 --> 03:07:09,640
One day Mint will sing arguably one of my favorite Metal Gear songs.

3138
03:07:10,380 --> 03:07:12,200
Invisible by Duran Duran.

3139
03:07:14,740 --> 03:07:15,480
One day.

3140
03:07:16,100 --> 03:07:16,540
Maybe.

3141
03:07:16,540 --> 03:07:20,140
Unless I never do that.

3142
03:07:21,140 --> 03:07:21,880
No, I'm just kidding.

3143
03:07:22,280 --> 03:07:23,360
Probably one day.

3144
03:07:32,800 --> 03:07:34,340
You guys have to hear...

3145
03:07:34,340 --> 03:07:35,860
You guys know the... What's their names?

3146
03:07:37,300 --> 03:07:37,980
Eiffel...

3147
03:07:37,980 --> 03:07:39,820
The guys that made...

3148
03:07:41,340 --> 03:07:42,700
Eiffel 65?

3149
03:07:46,320 --> 03:07:47,000
65.

3150
03:07:49,180 --> 03:07:49,820
Yes.

3151
03:07:50,380 --> 03:07:51,480
They have a song.

3152
03:07:52,260 --> 03:07:53,480
They have a song...

3153
03:07:54,900 --> 03:07:55,260
Called...

3154
03:07:55,260 --> 03:07:56,820
I think it's called My Console.

3155
03:07:58,080 --> 03:07:59,100
You guys should look up the lyrics.

3156
03:07:59,760 --> 03:08:00,120
Actually...

3157
03:08:00,120 --> 03:08:02,340
I'm just gonna karaoke it right now.

3158
03:08:04,620 --> 03:08:05,780
Wait, I don't know the song.

3159
03:08:06,120 --> 03:08:07,580
Nevermind, I can't karaoke it.

3160
03:08:07,900 --> 03:08:09,660
You should look up the...

3161
03:08:12,900 --> 03:08:14,360
I don't actually know how it goes.

3162
03:08:31,280 --> 03:08:32,620
Maybe next karaoke.

3163
03:08:35,220 --> 03:08:35,820
Which...

3164
03:08:36,660 --> 03:08:38,440
I think I have actually...

3165
03:08:38,440 --> 03:08:39,840
It's funny, I have two karaokes.

3166
03:08:40,340 --> 03:08:41,940
Well, I have like...

3167
03:08:41,940 --> 03:08:44,140
A lot of karaokes planned during my...

3168
03:08:44,780 --> 03:08:46,200
Somehow it happened that way.

3169
03:08:46,840 --> 03:08:48,120
Planned during my...

3170
03:08:49,800 --> 03:08:50,940
The decking?

3171
03:08:52,180 --> 03:08:52,780
Shrek!

3172
03:08:53,900 --> 03:08:56,840
I suppose there might be a slight stain by the decking.

3173
03:09:03,560 --> 03:09:08,020
I was boiling up some slime covered toadstools for a late night hot toady.

3174
03:09:08,680 --> 03:09:09,860
And it exploded everywhere.

3175
03:09:09,880 --> 03:09:10,860
It's a hot toady.

3176
03:09:11,680 --> 03:09:13,380
I forgot to use this yesterday.

3177
03:09:13,540 --> 03:09:14,100
Football!

3178
03:09:14,860 --> 03:09:15,380
Thank you!

3179
03:09:19,260 --> 03:09:19,820
But...

3180
03:09:21,320 --> 03:09:24,120
It was only supposed to be one karaoke and I got...

3181
03:09:24,840 --> 03:09:26,120
And then I got...

3182
03:09:26,680 --> 03:09:28,860
And then some plans happened and then...

3183
03:09:31,120 --> 03:09:34,740
And then I had to split the one that I was going to do.

3184
03:09:35,200 --> 03:09:37,600
Really kicked itself on the wall, sorry about that.

3185
03:09:38,800 --> 03:09:39,980
Yeah, you should be.

3186
03:09:41,420 --> 03:09:44,620
But then one karaoke turned into two.

3187
03:09:46,940 --> 03:09:48,720
If it all works out, hopefully.

3188
03:09:51,920 --> 03:09:54,120
But yeah, so...

3189
03:09:54,820 --> 03:09:57,360
It's for my debut...

3190
03:09:57,360 --> 03:09:58,680
It's on my debut week.

3191
03:09:58,680 --> 03:10:01,620
That there will be more karaokes.

3192
03:10:06,080 --> 03:10:07,200
Yeah, yeah.

3193
03:10:08,380 --> 03:10:09,620
The reason...

3194
03:10:11,640 --> 03:10:13,020
Oh my goodness.

3195
03:10:13,640 --> 03:10:17,980
I won't say yet why it all got split up.

3196
03:10:20,120 --> 03:10:20,960
But...

3197
03:10:22,320 --> 03:10:23,160
Yeah.

3198
03:10:23,940 --> 03:10:24,660
Should be fun.

3199
03:10:25,320 --> 03:10:26,320
Hopefully it all works out.

3200
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:27,980
And is a good time.

3201
03:10:27,980 --> 03:10:30,020
As long as your voice holds up.

3202
03:10:30,040 --> 03:10:31,960
Oh yeah, it's been like two weeks.

3203
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:32,920
I'll be fine by then.

3204
03:10:33,700 --> 03:10:35,060
My voice has gotten much better.

3205
03:10:35,540 --> 03:10:38,180
But sometimes I still squeak but my voice has...

3206
03:10:38,180 --> 03:10:39,580
Recovered a ton.

3207
03:10:39,720 --> 03:10:40,480
You don't even know.

3208
03:10:41,700 --> 03:10:42,420
So I'm all good.

3209
03:10:42,980 --> 03:10:43,280
I think.

3210
03:10:44,520 --> 03:10:47,020
I look like a sniper when I have the long one.

3211
03:10:47,220 --> 03:10:48,020
While I lay down.

3212
03:10:48,020 --> 03:10:49,480
Yeah.

3213
03:10:54,500 --> 03:10:58,980
I just also really just wanted to do karaoke with my new model.

3214
03:10:59,580 --> 03:11:00,620
With my new look.

3215
03:11:01,020 --> 03:11:01,860
Big lug...

3216
03:11:01,860 --> 03:11:02,500
Lug...

3217
03:11:02,500 --> 03:11:05,540
Love from Burger Squad.

3218
03:11:07,260 --> 03:11:08,540
Thank you, Chris.

3219
03:11:08,920 --> 03:11:10,040
In just a box.

3220
03:11:10,040 --> 03:11:10,940
Thank you.

3221
03:11:14,720 --> 03:11:16,340
Yeah, big lug.

3222
03:11:19,960 --> 03:11:21,340
I don't even know where that...

3223
03:11:21,340 --> 03:11:26,120
Usually I can tell where I mess up on words because my brain is like...

3224
03:11:26,120 --> 03:11:27,780
Combining two together, you know?

3225
03:11:27,860 --> 03:11:28,520
But I don't know.

3226
03:11:28,700 --> 03:11:33,520
I think I saw the Q in squad and my brain interpreted it as a G.

3227
03:11:35,220 --> 03:11:38,460
And so I just smushed it all together into big lug.

3228
03:11:43,240 --> 03:11:44,440
Usually there's like...

3229
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:46,040
There's a method to my madness.

3230
03:11:46,760 --> 03:11:48,240
Usually makes sense.

3231
03:11:49,180 --> 03:11:49,600
Usually.

3232
03:11:55,100 --> 03:11:55,520
Usually.

3233
03:11:57,340 --> 03:11:59,320
My brain does work in strange ways.

3234
03:11:59,820 --> 03:12:00,500
I don't know.

3235
03:12:00,640 --> 03:12:02,520
I have such trouble reading and speaking.

3236
03:12:03,380 --> 03:12:03,900
I'm sorry.

3237
03:12:04,200 --> 03:12:05,500
I don't know why I'm a streamer.

3238
03:12:05,640 --> 03:12:06,390
When all you do...

3239
03:12:06,760 --> 03:12:09,060
Well, streamers, all they do are read and speak.

3240
03:12:09,820 --> 03:12:11,800
That's the thing I have the trouble with the most.

3241
03:12:17,750 --> 03:12:19,510
I believe it's been already six months.

3242
03:12:19,510 --> 03:12:21,170
Me neither.

3243
03:12:22,430 --> 03:12:23,870
Six whole months.

3244
03:12:25,530 --> 03:12:28,250
Six months I'm getting a new look.

3245
03:12:30,270 --> 03:12:32,810
You know, it took six months to get a new look rather.

3246
03:12:41,840 --> 03:12:43,060
I don't know.

3247
03:12:43,260 --> 03:12:48,520
I'm sure there's like guesses about who my new model's mama is.

3248
03:12:48,740 --> 03:12:49,880
Of course I'm gonna...

3249
03:12:49,880 --> 03:12:50,760
Even if it's...

3250
03:12:50,760 --> 03:12:52,740
Even if you know or think you know.

3251
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:55,640
I won't say.

3252
03:12:55,820 --> 03:12:57,620
I won't confirm or deny, you know.

3253
03:12:58,740 --> 03:12:59,090
But...

3254
03:12:59,800 --> 03:13:02,440
I originally wasn't going to ask them.

3255
03:13:03,500 --> 03:13:04,880
I was like...

3256
03:13:05,460 --> 03:13:09,000
I had actually a few other artists in mind.

3257
03:13:09,400 --> 03:13:12,880
Because I thought maybe they would be busy or...

3258
03:13:15,800 --> 03:13:17,280
I wasn't sure.

3259
03:13:17,280 --> 03:13:20,320
With stuff like that.

3260
03:13:20,700 --> 03:13:22,400
But luckily it worked out.

3261
03:13:23,540 --> 03:13:24,300
So...

3262
03:13:24,300 --> 03:13:25,320
Happy about that.

3263
03:13:27,620 --> 03:13:30,480
Why are you the most chaotic power washer I've seen?

3264
03:13:30,640 --> 03:13:31,680
What are you talking about?

3265
03:13:31,920 --> 03:13:32,680
This is fine.

3266
03:13:37,360 --> 03:13:38,880
This is fine.

3267
03:13:47,640 --> 03:13:48,400
But...

3268
03:13:48,400 --> 03:13:49,260
Yeah.

3269
03:13:50,320 --> 03:13:50,700
So...

3270
03:13:50,700 --> 03:13:52,900
For anyone who's just like...

3271
03:13:52,900 --> 03:13:53,860
Of course.

3272
03:13:54,510 --> 03:13:57,940
Of course Mint went with that artist originally.

3273
03:13:58,640 --> 03:14:00,060
I was not going to.

3274
03:14:01,580 --> 03:14:02,620
Am I happy I did?

3275
03:14:03,340 --> 03:14:04,220
A hundred percent.

3276
03:14:04,600 --> 03:14:05,540
Thousand percent.

3277
03:14:05,740 --> 03:14:07,180
Absolutely so happy.

3278
03:14:09,720 --> 03:14:11,830
And you guys will be like...

3279
03:14:13,460 --> 03:14:15,980
Fresh Mint looks so...

3280
03:14:15,980 --> 03:14:17,180
Fresh and cute.

3281
03:14:17,800 --> 03:14:18,080
Maybe.

3282
03:14:18,840 --> 03:14:19,420
Hopefully.

3283
03:14:21,380 --> 03:14:21,860
So...

3284
03:14:22,740 --> 03:14:23,220
But...

3285
03:14:23,220 --> 03:14:23,620
Yeah.

3286
03:14:24,660 --> 03:14:25,820
It wasn't like...

3287
03:14:25,820 --> 03:14:27,400
Oh, I didn't want to go with the artist.

3288
03:14:27,640 --> 03:14:28,700
I just was like...

3289
03:14:30,720 --> 03:14:31,420
I don't know.

3290
03:14:31,500 --> 03:14:32,080
I was like...

3291
03:14:32,080 --> 03:14:33,820
You know, if they...

3292
03:14:33,820 --> 03:14:35,620
Are busy and stuff.

3293
03:14:44,310 --> 03:14:46,630
Mint 3.0 is Mint after taking a shower.

3294
03:14:47,330 --> 03:14:48,370
But Mint looks cute even now.

3295
03:14:49,990 --> 03:14:51,690
But I can go beyond.

3296
03:14:52,770 --> 03:14:53,910
I can go beyond.

3297
03:14:54,550 --> 03:14:56,310
It's power washed Mint.

3298
03:14:59,210 --> 03:14:59,710
Essentially.

3299
03:15:01,650 --> 03:15:02,830
So excited for Fresh Mint.

3300
03:15:03,490 --> 03:15:03,750
Yeah!

3301
03:15:04,410 --> 03:15:04,970
Oh my gosh.

3302
03:15:05,130 --> 03:15:06,110
I'm like...

3303
03:15:06,110 --> 03:15:07,530
Trying to be so patient.

3304
03:15:07,710 --> 03:15:08,980
But guys, my patience is...

3305
03:15:09,710 --> 03:15:10,710
Is waning.

3306
03:15:13,110 --> 03:15:14,170
Even though it's not even...

3307
03:15:14,170 --> 03:15:14,910
Nothing is complete.

3308
03:15:15,590 --> 03:15:17,390
So I literally can't even be like...

3309
03:15:17,390 --> 03:15:18,370
Oh, everything is done.

3310
03:15:18,410 --> 03:15:19,870
I just have to wait until the day.

3311
03:15:20,390 --> 03:15:20,650
No.

3312
03:15:21,790 --> 03:15:22,670
I can't even...

3313
03:15:22,670 --> 03:15:22,970
I can't...

3314
03:15:22,970 --> 03:15:23,810
Nothing is complete.

3315
03:15:25,470 --> 03:15:25,830
Hold.

3316
03:15:27,930 --> 03:15:28,570
Hold.

3317
03:15:30,850 --> 03:15:31,970
I must hold.

3318
03:15:33,130 --> 03:15:34,210
Just as you must...

3319
03:15:35,730 --> 03:15:37,690
When you are waiting for my stream...

3320
03:15:37,690 --> 03:15:38,090
To begin.

3321
03:15:38,650 --> 03:15:39,630
I must also hold.

3322
03:15:41,070 --> 03:15:42,350
For my own stuff.

3323
03:15:46,470 --> 03:15:47,890
How do you think we feel?

3324
03:15:48,030 --> 03:15:51,050
I think I have way more impatience.

3325
03:15:52,970 --> 03:15:54,430
I felt kind of silly...

3326
03:15:54,430 --> 03:15:56,810
Announcing it with so much time in advance.

3327
03:15:56,970 --> 03:15:58,410
I was like...

3328
03:15:58,740 --> 03:16:00,250
I was like...

3329
03:16:02,680 --> 03:16:03,310
What's the word?

3330
03:16:06,250 --> 03:16:07,530
I was like...

3331
03:16:07,530 --> 03:16:08,530
It's a whole month.

3332
03:16:08,630 --> 03:16:10,770
That's a ridiculous amount of waiting time.

3333
03:16:13,190 --> 03:16:15,970
Because I initially was going to...

3334
03:16:19,780 --> 03:16:22,330
Have my birthday be the debut day.

3335
03:16:22,970 --> 03:16:24,350
I just was like...

3336
03:16:24,350 --> 03:16:25,810
You know, I'll just announce it instead.

3337
03:16:30,060 --> 03:16:31,080
Gotta build the hype.

3338
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:32,000
But there's so much...

3339
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:33,480
There's such thing as like...

3340
03:16:33,480 --> 03:16:34,600
Waiting too much time...

3341
03:16:34,600 --> 03:16:36,160
And then people forget about it.

3342
03:16:36,660 --> 03:16:37,100
You know?

3343
03:16:38,520 --> 03:16:39,600
That's what I feel.

3344
03:16:53,220 --> 03:16:56,300
One thing I can say is...

3345
03:16:56,300 --> 03:16:58,060
There may possibly...

3346
03:16:58,060 --> 03:16:58,760
Here's a little...

3347
03:16:58,760 --> 03:16:59,960
Since you guys are watching...

3348
03:16:59,960 --> 03:17:01,920
I'll give you guys a little preview...

3349
03:17:01,920 --> 03:17:03,440
Or like a little...

3350
03:17:03,440 --> 03:17:04,320
Something something.

3351
03:17:04,480 --> 03:17:05,200
There may be...

3352
03:17:06,080 --> 03:17:06,640
Some...

3353
03:17:06,640 --> 03:17:07,120
This is...

3354
03:17:07,120 --> 03:17:09,500
And this is kind of why the karaoke got broken up.

3355
03:17:09,780 --> 03:17:11,840
There might be some karaoke guests?

3356
03:17:13,200 --> 03:17:14,300
Special guests?

3357
03:17:14,600 --> 03:17:14,880
Maybe?

3358
03:17:16,480 --> 03:17:17,600
Thank you!

3359
03:17:23,540 --> 03:17:25,200
I don't know...

3360
03:17:25,200 --> 03:17:25,960
I've literally...

3361
03:17:27,800 --> 03:17:30,320
I don't know if you could guess any of them.

3362
03:17:37,080 --> 03:17:37,480
Nice.

3363
03:17:41,560 --> 03:17:43,180
It's fine debuting at the end of the month?

3364
03:17:44,600 --> 03:17:45,800
Gave me something to look forward to?

3365
03:17:46,700 --> 03:17:47,860
Yeah, if all goes well.

3366
03:17:47,980 --> 03:17:48,780
It's on Halloween.

3367
03:17:49,260 --> 03:17:50,100
It's like, you know...

3368
03:17:51,500 --> 03:17:53,460
Halloween is a...

3369
03:17:53,460 --> 03:17:54,320
Important day for me.

3370
03:17:54,440 --> 03:17:55,100
I'm a ghost.

3371
03:18:01,660 --> 03:18:02,320
Guests?

3372
03:18:10,870 --> 03:18:12,410
I asked some people.

3373
03:18:13,450 --> 03:18:15,050
I asked some people.

3374
03:18:19,800 --> 03:18:20,860
So we'll see.

3375
03:18:21,200 --> 03:18:23,020
Hopefully, you know...

3376
03:18:23,020 --> 03:18:25,160
Everybody I asked said yes.

3377
03:18:25,760 --> 03:18:27,560
Hopefully, they're not too busy.

3378
03:18:28,580 --> 03:18:30,580
And are able to do it, you know?

3379
03:18:30,880 --> 03:18:31,580
To make it.

3380
03:18:33,120 --> 03:18:34,420
Will there be candy?

3381
03:18:35,340 --> 03:18:36,660
There will be...

3382
03:18:36,660 --> 03:18:37,540
Eye candy?

3383
03:18:37,960 --> 03:18:38,840
A.K.A.

3384
03:18:39,040 --> 03:18:39,500
Me?

3385
03:18:43,860 --> 03:18:45,170
There will be...

3386
03:18:47,900 --> 03:18:49,160
Yeah, that.

3387
03:18:53,810 --> 03:18:54,180
Right?

3388
03:18:56,320 --> 03:18:57,860
I'll take your entire stock.

3389
03:18:57,880 --> 03:18:58,500
Of what?

3390
03:18:59,700 --> 03:19:01,180
Can I leave now?

3391
03:19:03,690 --> 03:19:04,380
Not yet.

3392
03:19:05,960 --> 03:19:07,860
Shrek is not granted his permission.

3393
03:19:10,680 --> 03:19:12,220
Maybe we need to do some of this.

3394
03:19:13,080 --> 03:19:13,640
The onion.

3395
03:19:18,930 --> 03:19:20,190
Why is it purple?

3396
03:19:24,070 --> 03:19:24,590
Sexy!

3397
03:19:25,170 --> 03:19:27,130
Then there's all that...

3398
03:19:27,750 --> 03:19:28,270
Stoge...

3399
03:19:28,270 --> 03:19:29,810
Down the side of the house.

3400
03:19:30,150 --> 03:19:30,790
What is that?

3401
03:19:36,960 --> 03:19:39,860
We were having a romantic mud bath...

3402
03:19:39,860 --> 03:19:41,740
And I caught a few fairies...

3403
03:19:41,740 --> 03:19:43,680
In bottles for soft lighting.

3404
03:19:44,160 --> 03:19:44,820
Oh my gosh.

3405
03:19:44,880 --> 03:19:45,740
If I was a fairy...

3406
03:19:47,200 --> 03:19:48,420
That'd be kind of messed up.

3407
03:19:49,760 --> 03:19:51,520
But also maybe deserved.

3408
03:19:52,940 --> 03:19:55,020
Then to create the full spa experience...

3409
03:19:55,020 --> 03:19:58,780
I let off a real barrage of bubbly stinkers.

3410
03:20:01,480 --> 03:20:04,960
Can you imagine Shrek typing all of this with his fingers?

3411
03:20:07,400 --> 03:20:09,940
Guess the smell was too much for the fairies...

3412
03:20:09,940 --> 03:20:10,780
And they died.

3413
03:20:18,810 --> 03:20:20,570
I'd prefer you as an elf.

3414
03:20:23,350 --> 03:20:23,830
Yeah...

3415
03:20:23,830 --> 03:20:25,190
Maybe me too.

3416
03:20:26,910 --> 03:20:28,310
I mean, but fairies, elves...

3417
03:20:28,310 --> 03:20:29,190
They're close enough, right?

3418
03:20:31,830 --> 03:20:33,010
They're close enough.

3419
03:20:33,090 --> 03:20:34,190
They're pretty much the same.

3420
03:20:47,700 --> 03:20:49,540
Them fairies are small and evil.

3421
03:20:52,880 --> 03:20:54,580
I mean, you don't have to be...

3422
03:20:54,580 --> 03:20:57,660
You don't have to be small and evil to be a fairy.

3423
03:21:00,280 --> 03:21:01,880
Is it supposed to be green?

3424
03:21:02,040 --> 03:21:03,420
Okay, yes, it's supposed to be green.

3425
03:21:06,980 --> 03:21:08,860
Oh wait, let's see if we can go now.

3426
03:21:09,900 --> 03:21:10,080
No!

3427
03:21:12,320 --> 03:21:13,240
Almost maybe.

3428
03:21:14,080 --> 03:21:14,940
Maybe almost.

3429
03:21:15,960 --> 03:21:16,780
Shrek, please.

3430
03:21:17,620 --> 03:21:20,260
Don't you need someone to clean your house?

3431
03:21:20,600 --> 03:21:21,140
Your swamp?

3432
03:21:22,960 --> 03:21:24,540
Maybe I need to get the purple up.

3433
03:21:25,240 --> 03:21:26,360
And that will be like...

3434
03:21:26,360 --> 03:21:26,920
Because...

3435
03:21:26,920 --> 03:21:28,120
I think there's like...

3436
03:21:28,120 --> 03:21:32,360
From the pictures I saw, there's like purple at the swamp and stuff, so...

3437
03:21:33,500 --> 03:21:34,520
I want to see...

3438
03:21:34,520 --> 03:21:35,180
Don't care.

3439
03:21:43,140 --> 03:21:44,220
Are we there yet?

3440
03:21:45,120 --> 03:21:48,140
In the Hanzo's honeymoon hideaway job, wait in the onion.

3441
03:21:48,940 --> 03:21:49,180
Oh!

3442
03:21:49,660 --> 03:21:50,580
Oh my gosh!

3443
03:21:50,920 --> 03:21:53,440
You could get an achievement for just chilling in the onion.

3444
03:21:56,200 --> 03:21:57,860
I like you just the way you are, Minton.

3445
03:21:58,200 --> 03:21:58,840
Thank you!

3446
03:22:00,700 --> 03:22:00,920
Green.

3447
03:22:03,800 --> 03:22:06,040
Thanks for accepting me at my worst.

3448
03:22:11,730 --> 03:22:12,270
Nice.

3449
03:22:30,610 --> 03:22:32,410
We're not going back to this though.

3450
03:22:33,470 --> 03:22:34,470
Cease.

3451
03:22:35,570 --> 03:22:36,150
Cease.

3452
03:22:38,510 --> 03:22:39,510
Nice.

3453
03:22:40,390 --> 03:22:41,650
Interior clean.

3454
03:22:50,490 --> 03:22:51,770
Big ol' wheels.

3455
03:22:53,690 --> 03:22:54,850
Oh my gosh.

3456
03:22:56,110 --> 03:22:57,990
Just like an onion.

3457
03:22:58,750 --> 03:23:00,050
You peel the layers.

3458
03:23:00,230 --> 03:23:01,370
You peel the layers.

3459
03:23:02,730 --> 03:23:06,730
To reveal your true self.

3460
03:23:09,370 --> 03:23:10,650
How did they...

3461
03:23:10,650 --> 03:23:11,670
Oh my god!

3462
03:23:12,510 --> 03:23:14,590
The just married sign!

3463
03:23:15,930 --> 03:23:16,550
Wow!

3464
03:23:21,010 --> 03:23:22,150
It's legit.

3465
03:23:22,950 --> 03:23:24,310
They actually did it.

3466
03:23:28,910 --> 03:23:30,150
This onion...

3467
03:23:30,150 --> 03:23:30,850
Oh my goodness, sorry.

3468
03:23:31,250 --> 03:23:32,630
This onion looks so rotted.

3469
03:23:34,550 --> 03:23:38,190
This is what my brain would probably look like if you took it out of my head.

3470
03:23:41,370 --> 03:23:44,110
The onion pre-washed, you know.

3471
03:23:45,730 --> 03:23:46,950
Not the onion now.

3472
03:23:47,070 --> 03:23:48,190
Now the onion looks nice.

3473
03:23:49,010 --> 03:23:52,710
But the onion pre-washed probably would look like my brain, you know.

3474
03:23:55,190 --> 03:23:56,390
Just soiled.

3475
03:23:56,790 --> 03:23:57,390
Absolutely.

3476
03:23:58,490 --> 03:23:59,890
With many thoughts.

3477
03:24:00,810 --> 03:24:02,690
Many different types of topics.

3478
03:24:10,060 --> 03:24:11,080
Oh my goodness.

3479
03:24:16,110 --> 03:24:18,430
Why are so few ghost girls in games?

3480
03:24:19,290 --> 03:24:20,670
I don't know.

3481
03:24:20,990 --> 03:24:24,390
I think there's a lot of ghost girls in games, I'll be honest.

3482
03:24:24,570 --> 03:24:27,090
But, you know, I don't know.

3483
03:24:29,230 --> 03:24:32,910
I think people hate ghost girls.

3484
03:24:35,810 --> 03:24:39,170
We're not very sought after creatures, I guess.

3485
03:24:43,870 --> 03:24:45,030
Trap seals?

3486
03:24:48,810 --> 03:24:50,470
What a silly name.

3487
03:24:52,730 --> 03:24:53,470
Let's see.

3488
03:24:53,690 --> 03:24:55,050
This is good, this is good.

3489
03:24:55,570 --> 03:24:56,070
Oh, this one?

3490
03:24:56,810 --> 03:24:57,590
A little bit more.

3491
03:25:01,520 --> 03:25:02,780
Oh, there we go, that's why.

3492
03:25:04,820 --> 03:25:06,920
A lot of skeptics in life.

3493
03:25:07,240 --> 03:25:09,180
But you guys literally are seeing me.

3494
03:25:09,880 --> 03:25:13,160
You guys are seeing me in the afterlife.

3495
03:25:14,740 --> 03:25:15,860
Like you are...

3496
03:25:16,420 --> 03:25:18,080
You are witnessing me.

3497
03:25:18,820 --> 03:25:19,660
Oh, no.

3498
03:25:24,230 --> 03:25:24,950
Are we though?

3499
03:25:25,510 --> 03:25:25,950
Yes!

3500
03:25:26,750 --> 03:25:28,070
Where do you think I am?

3501
03:25:34,460 --> 03:25:35,340
Luggage chest.

3502
03:25:35,540 --> 03:25:36,100
Oh, there we go.

3503
03:25:36,420 --> 03:25:36,920
More stuff.

3504
03:25:37,080 --> 03:25:37,420
There we go.

3505
03:25:37,680 --> 03:25:38,040
Nice.

3506
03:25:42,230 --> 03:25:45,110
Trying to get in all these little side areas.

3507
03:25:47,890 --> 03:25:48,770
Luggage row.

3508
03:25:51,410 --> 03:25:53,630
You guys are able to see me.

3509
03:25:53,770 --> 03:25:54,830
Kind of, I think.

3510
03:25:55,010 --> 03:25:57,130
You guys have like a good sixth sense, you know?

3511
03:25:58,770 --> 03:26:02,150
Found a game with the latest episode of Digital Circus has a cute ghost girl.

3512
03:26:04,170 --> 03:26:04,770
Yes!

3513
03:26:05,130 --> 03:26:06,150
I watched it.

3514
03:26:08,770 --> 03:26:12,070
And like a really spooky ghost thing.

3515
03:26:13,570 --> 03:26:16,190
That guy is so scary in that...

3516
03:26:16,190 --> 03:26:17,650
The freaky ghost.

3517
03:26:21,370 --> 03:26:22,250
Oh, nice.

3518
03:26:23,130 --> 03:26:23,850
I can get up here.

3519
03:26:29,110 --> 03:26:29,950
Nice.

3520
03:26:35,200 --> 03:26:36,040
Okay.

3521
03:26:36,460 --> 03:26:38,080
Easy now, easy now.

3522
03:26:38,680 --> 03:26:40,000
Don't want to slip off.

3523
03:26:41,360 --> 03:26:43,460
Freaky ghost man.

3524
03:26:44,800 --> 03:26:45,640
Nice.

3525
03:26:51,410 --> 03:26:53,470
We must get to the swamp everybody.

3526
03:26:54,050 --> 03:26:55,570
We must get to the swamp.

3527
03:26:57,470 --> 03:26:58,810
So close.

3528
03:27:03,010 --> 03:27:04,350
At the swamp.

3529
03:27:05,030 --> 03:27:05,650
We'll see.

3530
03:27:25,520 --> 03:27:27,100
Did you get on the roof too?

3531
03:27:27,780 --> 03:27:30,760
Yeah, I did a little bit.

3532
03:27:32,280 --> 03:27:34,460
I guess I actually... Let's do this for the roof.

3533
03:27:43,610 --> 03:27:47,050
Freaky mint was here.

3534
03:27:50,670 --> 03:27:51,310
Yeah.

3535
03:27:51,310 --> 03:27:51,770
Yeah.

3536
03:27:52,190 --> 03:27:52,990
Did I eat yet?

3537
03:27:53,170 --> 03:27:54,510
No, I didn't.

3538
03:27:55,210 --> 03:27:56,070
It's okay though.

3539
03:27:56,730 --> 03:27:57,710
I'm a tough cookie.

3540
03:27:58,870 --> 03:27:59,950
Just like this house.

3541
03:28:03,820 --> 03:28:05,800
Wait, it says this is made of wood.

3542
03:28:09,720 --> 03:28:10,400
Nevermind, sorry.

3543
03:28:10,460 --> 03:28:11,220
This is multipurpose.

3544
03:28:11,940 --> 03:28:12,980
I'm using the wood.

3545
03:28:13,540 --> 03:28:14,660
Oh my goodness, I messed up.

3546
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:15,980
Okay, this...

3547
03:28:15,980 --> 03:28:16,100
Okay.

3548
03:28:16,500 --> 03:28:17,580
Yeah, multipurpose.

3549
03:28:20,900 --> 03:28:22,900
I was going to say, is this not gingerbread?

3550
03:28:27,560 --> 03:28:28,940
Oh, I think it's out.

3551
03:28:30,040 --> 03:28:32,340
That didn't last literally two seconds.

3552
03:28:37,060 --> 03:28:37,660
Stubby.

3553
03:28:42,880 --> 03:28:45,460
I think we maybe need to get to 75%.

3554
03:28:46,340 --> 03:28:47,200
75%, baby.

3555
03:28:47,840 --> 03:28:48,480
Let's go.

3556
03:28:49,660 --> 03:28:50,260
75%.

3557
03:28:51,120 --> 03:28:51,720
Nevermind.

3558
03:28:52,080 --> 03:28:54,480
We need to go...

3559
03:28:54,480 --> 03:28:55,560
Try wide nozzle.

3560
03:28:56,380 --> 03:28:57,360
Oh, this one, right?

3561
03:28:57,440 --> 03:28:58,020
The 40°?

3562
03:29:00,580 --> 03:29:01,920
Since we're right here.

3563
03:29:02,220 --> 03:29:02,880
Up and close.

3564
03:29:06,790 --> 03:29:07,670
Come on.

3565
03:29:08,570 --> 03:29:09,670
To the swamp.

3566
03:29:10,170 --> 03:29:11,410
To the swamp.

3567
03:29:12,530 --> 03:29:14,710
Oh, but it doesn't really penetrate well.

3568
03:29:17,550 --> 03:29:18,410
Come on.

3569
03:29:22,050 --> 03:29:23,330
You disgusting...

3570
03:29:24,030 --> 03:29:25,670
How did it get...

3571
03:29:25,670 --> 03:29:27,230
How did it turn to black?

3572
03:29:29,230 --> 03:29:29,870
Yeah.

3573
03:29:30,650 --> 03:29:33,330
But this freak...

3574
03:29:33,330 --> 03:29:35,930
Was not me.

3575
03:29:41,530 --> 03:29:42,050
Mold.

3576
03:29:42,390 --> 03:29:42,910
Oh my gosh.

3577
03:29:43,090 --> 03:29:43,930
They just like...

3578
03:29:43,930 --> 03:29:47,910
They have to actually like tear down this place because they made it so disgusting.

3579
03:29:48,410 --> 03:29:50,890
It just actually grew black mold.

3580
03:29:51,390 --> 03:29:54,330
And so, anybody who lives here will just die.

3581
03:29:59,490 --> 03:30:01,670
It does look like they molded...

3582
03:30:01,670 --> 03:30:03,670
Like maybe they got the gingerbread house wet.

3583
03:30:03,670 --> 03:30:05,770
Wait, but that's what I'm doing too.

3584
03:30:08,290 --> 03:30:08,870
Mysterious.

3585
03:30:10,410 --> 03:30:10,990
80%.

3586
03:30:10,990 --> 03:30:11,650
Yeah!

3587
03:30:12,590 --> 03:30:15,090
The roof might be a wee bit scorched too.

3588
03:30:15,430 --> 03:30:17,030
Oh, scorched.

3589
03:30:21,470 --> 03:30:23,290
The one thing we didn't think about.

3590
03:30:25,810 --> 03:30:26,910
It was a fire.

3591
03:30:27,130 --> 03:30:28,230
Revenge lightning.

3592
03:30:28,890 --> 03:30:29,990
Not going into it.

3593
03:30:30,870 --> 03:30:31,450
Ra...

3594
03:30:31,450 --> 03:30:32,090
Raiden?

3595
03:30:32,090 --> 03:30:35,730
Let's just say we got on the wrong side of someone down at the beach.

3596
03:30:36,790 --> 03:30:37,390
Revengeance?

3597
03:30:38,030 --> 03:30:38,470
Lightning?

3598
03:30:38,810 --> 03:30:39,090
Raiden?

3599
03:30:39,590 --> 03:30:39,950
Raiden?

3600
03:30:44,000 --> 03:30:45,140
Oh, dragons.

3601
03:30:45,800 --> 03:30:46,860
That would make more sense.

3602
03:30:53,430 --> 03:30:55,110
That would make more sense.

3603
03:30:55,510 --> 03:30:56,890
I think so.

3604
03:30:57,490 --> 03:30:58,710
Maybe a little bit.

3605
03:31:05,200 --> 03:31:06,060
This game.

3606
03:31:06,720 --> 03:31:07,600
This game.

3607
03:31:12,300 --> 03:31:13,840
It's killing me.

3608
03:31:14,820 --> 03:31:16,920
I mean, I'm already dead, but...

3609
03:31:23,570 --> 03:31:24,690
There's a...

3610
03:31:24,690 --> 03:31:25,570
What's it called?

3611
03:31:26,450 --> 03:31:28,070
Shrek is based off of like actual...

3612
03:31:29,730 --> 03:31:30,930
Wait, we'll do this one.

3613
03:31:32,890 --> 03:31:34,010
Like actual...

3614
03:31:34,010 --> 03:31:35,310
Folk tale, right?

3615
03:31:41,870 --> 03:31:42,350
A book?

3616
03:31:43,170 --> 03:31:43,550
Yeah.

3617
03:31:44,850 --> 03:31:46,510
Has anyone ever read it before?

3618
03:31:53,470 --> 03:31:54,210
It was a kid's book.

3619
03:31:56,330 --> 03:31:57,310
Was it...

3620
03:31:57,310 --> 03:31:59,690
It's not Brothers Grimm, is it?

3621
03:31:59,850 --> 03:32:00,470
Or like...

3622
03:32:01,070 --> 03:32:02,330
How old is Shrek?

3623
03:32:04,670 --> 03:32:06,270
Thanks for getting me into Metal Gear.

3624
03:32:06,850 --> 03:32:07,610
I really liked it.

3625
03:32:07,730 --> 03:32:09,150
It almost made me gay.

3626
03:32:13,350 --> 03:32:14,630
Oh, it's more recent.

3627
03:32:17,210 --> 03:32:18,250
The 1900s.

3628
03:32:18,350 --> 03:32:18,990
Oh my gosh.

3629
03:32:23,110 --> 03:32:23,610
Wow.

3630
03:32:34,460 --> 03:32:36,780
I've never heard of it until the movie.

3631
03:32:39,480 --> 03:32:41,060
Don't say it like that.

3632
03:32:41,980 --> 03:32:43,860
I learned that from Matara.

3633
03:32:47,460 --> 03:32:50,180
Looks like there's a bunch of bird poop all over it now.

3634
03:32:50,340 --> 03:32:51,800
Or how it is.

3635
03:32:53,540 --> 03:32:53,960
88.

3636
03:32:54,480 --> 03:32:55,400
Come on, 90.

3637
03:32:57,940 --> 03:32:59,400
Come on, once we get to 90...

3638
03:32:59,980 --> 03:33:01,180
It will be...

3639
03:33:02,060 --> 03:33:03,200
Letting us through?

3640
03:33:03,640 --> 03:33:04,540
Letting us in?

3641
03:33:08,340 --> 03:33:10,240
The movie is barely related anyway.

3642
03:33:10,340 --> 03:33:10,980
No way.

3643
03:33:16,060 --> 03:33:17,780
Does it have like all the...

3644
03:33:17,780 --> 03:33:19,800
Fairy tale creatures...

3645
03:33:21,060 --> 03:33:22,520
In the book, kind of.

3646
03:33:22,820 --> 03:33:24,520
That was always like a fun thing, you know?

3647
03:33:24,760 --> 03:33:25,720
It was always...

3648
03:33:25,720 --> 03:33:26,880
It was always fun when...

3649
03:33:27,400 --> 03:33:29,640
Movies and series and stuff would do that.

3650
03:33:30,020 --> 03:33:31,080
It would be like...

3651
03:33:31,080 --> 03:33:32,260
Look at all these...

3652
03:33:32,260 --> 03:33:33,260
Disney princesses together.

3653
03:33:33,460 --> 03:33:35,420
Look at all these fairy tale characters together.

3654
03:33:35,660 --> 03:33:36,440
You know?

3655
03:33:39,020 --> 03:33:40,860
You read some of it to us on your...

3656
03:33:40,860 --> 03:33:42,640
Oh, that's right!

3657
03:33:43,920 --> 03:33:45,040
Yes, the Shrek!

3658
03:33:45,280 --> 03:33:45,940
I remember!

3659
03:33:49,000 --> 03:33:50,400
Yes, because he...

3660
03:33:51,780 --> 03:33:53,260
What was happening?

3661
03:33:53,720 --> 03:33:55,980
Some of the pages, I couldn't tell if they were real or not.

3662
03:33:56,020 --> 03:33:56,900
That's right!

3663
03:34:15,490 --> 03:34:16,690
I do remember.

3664
03:34:19,290 --> 03:34:21,350
Remember who you are.

3665
03:34:23,490 --> 03:34:24,270
Oh my god, look!

3666
03:34:24,370 --> 03:34:25,990
It's so clean on this side!

3667
03:34:26,530 --> 03:34:28,850
Minus a few specks, but it's whatever.

3668
03:34:30,490 --> 03:34:33,230
It's like mostly the cleanest it'll ever be, ever.

3669
03:34:34,790 --> 03:34:35,970
So close to a hundred.

3670
03:34:36,190 --> 03:34:36,550
I know!

3671
03:34:36,750 --> 03:34:37,950
We're so close, you guys!

3672
03:34:41,450 --> 03:34:44,370
Let's now waterboard anybody living in there.

3673
03:34:45,290 --> 03:34:48,550
By sending all the water inside and flooding the home.

3674
03:34:48,750 --> 03:34:51,390
It's currently sealed so they won't be able to get out.

3675
03:34:52,470 --> 03:34:53,030
Nice!

3676
03:35:03,320 --> 03:35:05,180
The fireplace is now ruined.

3677
03:35:05,640 --> 03:35:06,140
Yes!

3678
03:35:08,620 --> 03:35:10,500
But you know who appreciates that?

3679
03:35:11,040 --> 03:35:12,020
Old Saint Nick.

3680
03:35:12,440 --> 03:35:13,680
Because he's gotta go down that.

3681
03:35:14,080 --> 03:35:17,080
And now it's more mushy for his tushy to fit in.

3682
03:35:22,000 --> 03:35:23,540
Oh my gosh, there's so much air.

3683
03:35:30,580 --> 03:35:31,940
Good point.

3684
03:35:32,380 --> 03:35:32,740
See?

3685
03:35:33,720 --> 03:35:35,000
Always think of Santa.

3686
03:35:36,080 --> 03:35:37,560
Whenever you do something...

3687
03:35:38,140 --> 03:35:40,700
Before you make that tweet...

3688
03:35:40,700 --> 03:35:42,500
Before you...

3689
03:35:42,500 --> 03:35:45,560
Before you, you know...

3690
03:35:46,180 --> 03:35:50,820
Do anything in your life or afterlife if you're alive or dead like me...

3691
03:35:50,820 --> 03:35:52,480
Always think...

3692
03:35:52,480 --> 03:35:54,360
Would Santa approve of this?

3693
03:35:54,860 --> 03:35:57,180
Would this get me on the naughty list?

3694
03:36:00,040 --> 03:36:01,840
No, not would Santa do.

3695
03:36:02,320 --> 03:36:03,760
How would Santa think?

3696
03:36:03,860 --> 03:36:04,840
What would Santa think?

3697
03:36:05,580 --> 03:36:07,440
You don't want Santa's disapproval.

3698
03:36:08,360 --> 03:36:08,740
Right?

3699
03:36:09,620 --> 03:36:12,200
That would be like the most pathetic thing ever.

3700
03:36:12,880 --> 03:36:16,000
If Santa even is just like, come on.

3701
03:36:16,460 --> 03:36:16,880
You know?

3702
03:36:16,880 --> 03:36:16,920
You know?

3703
03:36:26,480 --> 03:36:28,040
What if Santa is a freak too?

3704
03:36:28,420 --> 03:36:29,840
He can't be.

3705
03:36:30,540 --> 03:36:31,820
Santa is Santa.

3706
03:36:34,180 --> 03:36:35,460
He can't be a freak.

3707
03:36:40,650 --> 03:36:42,270
Santa can be a hater though.

3708
03:36:43,970 --> 03:36:45,130
Oh, maybe if you're...

3709
03:36:45,130 --> 03:36:47,670
Sounds like someone who's been on the naughty list before.

3710
03:36:47,790 --> 03:36:52,170
Sounds like something someone would say who's been on the naughty list would say.

3711
03:36:52,170 --> 03:36:54,770
Oh, Santa, that guy sucks.

3712
03:36:57,390 --> 03:36:58,390
Yeah, why does he suck?

3713
03:36:58,570 --> 03:37:00,030
Oh, he's just a hater.

3714
03:37:00,210 --> 03:37:03,470
Oh, sounds like someone was naughty.

3715
03:37:05,410 --> 03:37:06,650
I think...

3716
03:37:06,650 --> 03:37:09,810
Me thinks someone had coal delivered to them.

3717
03:37:12,590 --> 03:37:14,210
Me thinks, me thinks.

3718
03:37:21,880 --> 03:37:23,660
This icing part is annoying.

3719
03:37:37,440 --> 03:37:39,220
You're like an onion for sure.

3720
03:37:39,820 --> 03:37:43,140
What made you come to the for sure conclusion of that sentence?

3721
03:37:47,120 --> 03:37:50,080
Some angry guy in a wheelchair told me Santa wasn't real.

3722
03:37:50,400 --> 03:37:51,960
He made my boss cry.

3723
03:37:52,720 --> 03:37:53,000
No!

3724
03:37:56,380 --> 03:37:59,580
I bet your boss had a big heart.

3725
03:38:00,360 --> 03:38:01,580
Big heart, boss.

3726
03:38:04,440 --> 03:38:05,720
Big boss for sure.

3727
03:38:07,200 --> 03:38:08,440
The H is silent.

3728
03:38:08,920 --> 03:38:09,960
Big boss.

3729
03:38:10,500 --> 03:38:10,940
Get it?

3730
03:38:11,160 --> 03:38:11,740
There's a H.

3731
03:38:11,900 --> 03:38:12,820
The big boss.

3732
03:38:13,140 --> 03:38:14,140
Big boss.

3733
03:38:21,490 --> 03:38:22,230
I'm stuck.

3734
03:38:30,250 --> 03:38:31,590
Screw that wheelchair guy.

3735
03:38:31,690 --> 03:38:33,430
Yeah, all my friends hate that wheelchair guy.

3736
03:38:41,990 --> 03:38:44,310
Wouldn't ever want him showing up in my chat.

3737
03:38:46,650 --> 03:38:48,210
Oh my gosh, grass are here.

3738
03:38:50,830 --> 03:38:52,530
Should I ban you just for the giggles?

3739
03:39:04,370 --> 03:39:06,590
Just for a little...

3740
03:39:07,410 --> 03:39:08,550
Hee-haw time.

3741
03:39:09,830 --> 03:39:11,830
A little funny moment.

3742
03:39:14,670 --> 03:39:16,170
Always do it for the bit.

3743
03:39:17,590 --> 03:39:19,070
You'd understand, right grass?

3744
03:39:20,790 --> 03:39:21,770
You'd understand.

3745
03:39:22,250 --> 03:39:22,890
For the bit.

3746
03:39:24,550 --> 03:39:27,070
Yeah, still banned in Doki's channel.

3747
03:39:30,290 --> 03:39:33,470
Not that my Doki was like, how do you know about grass?

3748
03:39:37,330 --> 03:39:39,530
Because grass came to my channel.

3749
03:39:41,590 --> 03:39:44,210
Sad about being banned at yours.

3750
03:39:59,420 --> 03:40:00,540
So sad.

3751
03:40:04,570 --> 03:40:06,430
What even did you lie about?

3752
03:40:07,090 --> 03:40:08,230
What lies were told?

3753
03:40:14,630 --> 03:40:16,130
I think it's pretty messed up though.

3754
03:40:16,190 --> 03:40:17,330
I did not lie.

3755
03:40:23,930 --> 03:40:25,670
I hate Santa.

3756
03:40:26,250 --> 03:40:26,530
No!

3757
03:40:31,640 --> 03:40:32,640
He wasn't even wrong.

3758
03:40:32,760 --> 03:40:34,400
Doki just didn't follow the directions correctly.

3759
03:40:36,200 --> 03:40:37,780
It's always like that, isn't it?

3760
03:40:38,440 --> 03:40:42,000
Like, you can't blame the streamer in those kinds of situations.

3761
03:40:45,240 --> 03:40:47,660
Streamer brain is in real condition, okay?

3762
03:40:50,300 --> 03:40:51,400
I'm sorry.

3763
03:40:54,860 --> 03:40:57,300
Streamer brain gets the best of all of us.

3764
03:41:02,280 --> 03:41:03,560
98%, you're right!

3765
03:41:04,960 --> 03:41:07,340
Now it's all just the tiny bits here.

3766
03:41:08,040 --> 03:41:09,180
Oh wait, I did get that donut.

3767
03:41:09,300 --> 03:41:10,260
I kept thinking I didn't.

3768
03:41:15,310 --> 03:41:16,730
We're so close, guys.

3769
03:41:17,390 --> 03:41:18,510
We're so close.

3770
03:41:20,010 --> 03:41:21,230
I can feel it.

3771
03:41:24,410 --> 03:41:26,170
Do you think we can get to the...

3772
03:41:27,910 --> 03:41:28,670
Nope, okay.

3773
03:41:28,670 --> 03:41:28,790
Okay,

3774
03:41:33,010 --> 03:41:34,950
you definitely...

3775
03:41:34,950 --> 03:41:35,490
Oh my goodness.

3776
03:41:36,290 --> 03:41:37,850
Let's bring this around.

3777
03:41:42,540 --> 03:41:45,000
Okay, okay, okay.

3778
03:41:45,300 --> 03:41:45,780
Here?

3779
03:41:51,940 --> 03:41:52,640
Nice.

3780
03:41:52,940 --> 03:41:55,740
Let's switch to the extender.

3781
03:41:58,160 --> 03:41:59,020
Nice.

3782
03:41:59,460 --> 03:42:00,260
I cleaned something.

3783
03:42:00,980 --> 03:42:01,400
Nice.

3784
03:42:04,640 --> 03:42:06,360
99%!

3785
03:42:06,360 --> 03:42:08,860
Okay, what's... Wait, what is it?

3786
03:42:11,200 --> 03:42:13,520
There's a way to see what... Oh, here.

3787
03:42:15,720 --> 03:42:17,820
Alright, let's start at the bottom.

3788
03:42:18,180 --> 03:42:19,140
Side window frames.

3789
03:42:21,940 --> 03:42:22,760
I see it.

3790
03:42:27,740 --> 03:42:28,820
I see it.

3791
03:42:29,760 --> 03:42:30,360
1%.

3792
03:42:31,080 --> 03:42:31,680
1?

3793
03:42:33,000 --> 03:42:34,240
Did I get it?

3794
03:42:34,340 --> 03:42:34,460
Oh.

3795
03:42:34,880 --> 03:42:35,860
1 out of 2.

3796
03:42:36,020 --> 03:42:36,880
Side walls.

3797
03:42:37,400 --> 03:42:38,340
This whole wall.

3798
03:42:38,380 --> 03:42:39,220
Oh, I see, I see.

3799
03:42:43,880 --> 03:42:46,020
Hold on, I'm getting the icing while I'm here.

3800
03:42:47,700 --> 03:42:48,120
Nice!

3801
03:42:51,200 --> 03:42:52,680
Underneath here probably is a thing.

3802
03:42:52,920 --> 03:42:53,120
Yup.

3803
03:42:54,480 --> 03:42:55,960
Under here I think I got.

3804
03:42:56,140 --> 03:42:57,340
It looks pretty clean.

3805
03:42:57,760 --> 03:42:58,280
Okay, what else?

3806
03:42:58,740 --> 03:43:00,320
You guys...

3807
03:43:00,320 --> 03:43:01,260
Roof icing.

3808
03:43:01,360 --> 03:43:02,160
Let's do that last.

3809
03:43:02,220 --> 03:43:03,800
This kind of looks hellish.

3810
03:43:04,060 --> 03:43:05,960
It's actually pretty hellish, so...

3811
03:43:05,960 --> 03:43:08,420
This one...

3812
03:43:08,420 --> 03:43:11,360
Oh, okay, it's just a tiny bit of stuff everywhere.

3813
03:43:13,880 --> 03:43:14,580
Oh!

3814
03:43:14,580 --> 03:43:15,940
2 in 1, baby!

3815
03:43:17,300 --> 03:43:18,000
3!

3816
03:43:18,300 --> 03:43:18,460
3!

3817
03:43:18,640 --> 03:43:18,820
3!

3818
03:43:19,120 --> 03:43:20,180
Okay, nice.

3819
03:43:23,080 --> 03:43:24,480
Rear eaves.

3820
03:43:25,220 --> 03:43:25,820
Oh, here?

3821
03:43:26,740 --> 03:43:27,960
Definitely disgusting.

3822
03:43:29,460 --> 03:43:30,160
Nasty.

3823
03:43:30,720 --> 03:43:31,420
Nice.

3824
03:43:32,160 --> 03:43:33,180
One more?

3825
03:43:39,770 --> 03:43:40,250
Okay.

3826
03:43:42,270 --> 03:43:42,750
Okay.

3827
03:43:43,770 --> 03:43:45,230
This one looks clean.

3828
03:43:47,770 --> 03:43:50,430
I'm like tilting my head up trying to say these, you know?

3829
03:43:51,090 --> 03:43:52,690
Ding, ding, ding, dopamine hint.

3830
03:43:53,150 --> 03:43:53,810
I know!

3831
03:43:54,990 --> 03:43:56,690
Oh gosh, we still have quite a bit though.

3832
03:43:56,870 --> 03:43:57,210
The chimney!

3833
03:43:57,310 --> 03:43:58,950
Oh, there is one more chimney donut!

3834
03:44:03,150 --> 03:44:04,090
Which one?

3835
03:44:04,470 --> 03:44:05,930
I knew I was missing one.

3836
03:44:06,170 --> 03:44:07,210
The top one!

3837
03:44:12,160 --> 03:44:12,840
Clear.

3838
03:44:14,660 --> 03:44:16,440
Column candy canes!

3839
03:44:17,080 --> 03:44:18,380
3 out of 4.

3840
03:44:18,980 --> 03:44:20,160
Column candy canes.

3841
03:44:25,570 --> 03:44:26,590
I tried.

3842
03:44:27,930 --> 03:44:29,430
Tried to get it while I fell.

3843
03:44:30,710 --> 03:44:32,130
Oh, front eave, we got that one.

3844
03:44:35,070 --> 03:44:36,470
Maybe I can get it from here.

3845
03:44:38,230 --> 03:44:38,910
Nice!

3846
03:44:39,650 --> 03:44:40,770
Roof icing.

3847
03:44:42,110 --> 03:44:43,770
What was I trying to clean?

3848
03:44:44,630 --> 03:44:46,290
Oh, these candy canes, that's right.

3849
03:44:52,700 --> 03:44:54,440
Get every little nook.

3850
03:44:55,100 --> 03:44:56,600
Every little bit.

3851
03:44:57,480 --> 03:44:57,980
Nice.

3852
03:44:59,060 --> 03:44:59,980
Was that the last one?

3853
03:45:01,380 --> 03:45:02,920
Column gun drops.

3854
03:45:06,870 --> 03:45:08,090
Mario, this one.

3855
03:45:09,130 --> 03:45:10,050
Got him.

3856
03:45:10,870 --> 03:45:11,230
Okay.

3857
03:45:12,470 --> 03:45:13,370
Deck bases.

3858
03:45:15,410 --> 03:45:16,430
This one.

3859
03:45:19,770 --> 03:45:21,290
Where are you not clean at?

3860
03:45:21,350 --> 03:45:21,890
Oh, down here?

3861
03:45:25,430 --> 03:45:27,630
The deck meringues.

3862
03:45:28,350 --> 03:45:29,490
Which one is not clean?

3863
03:45:29,530 --> 03:45:29,710
You?

3864
03:45:32,250 --> 03:45:32,870
Where at?

3865
03:45:32,950 --> 03:45:33,810
Oh, all over.

3866
03:45:34,170 --> 03:45:34,650
Got him.

3867
03:45:35,230 --> 03:45:35,910
Oh my gosh!

3868
03:45:36,350 --> 03:45:36,870
One more?

3869
03:45:37,870 --> 03:45:38,550
This one?

3870
03:45:39,130 --> 03:45:39,610
Where at?

3871
03:45:39,690 --> 03:45:40,790
Oh, from behind.

3872
03:45:46,770 --> 03:45:47,510
Got him.

3873
03:45:50,430 --> 03:45:54,830
Front door handle is like only 89%.

3874
03:45:54,830 --> 03:45:56,070
You?

3875
03:45:57,090 --> 03:45:57,930
Okay.

3876
03:46:00,090 --> 03:46:01,850
Front skirtings?

3877
03:46:05,290 --> 03:46:06,050
Oh, okay.

3878
03:46:08,870 --> 03:46:10,330
Let's do this.

3879
03:46:11,010 --> 03:46:12,870
Let's do...yeah that.

3880
03:46:13,170 --> 03:46:17,390
Notice that stuff too.

3881
03:46:17,390 --> 03:46:18,850
There we go.

3882
03:46:20,110 --> 03:46:21,370
Oh my gosh, you guys.

3883
03:46:21,550 --> 03:46:22,510
I can taste it.

3884
03:46:22,630 --> 03:46:24,150
And it's not just the gingerbread.

3885
03:46:24,530 --> 03:46:25,570
I can taste it.

3886
03:46:25,970 --> 03:46:26,670
Front wall?

3887
03:46:40,180 --> 03:46:40,740
Extend.

3888
03:46:45,080 --> 03:46:46,220
Where at though?

3889
03:46:47,840 --> 03:46:49,060
Where is it not clean?

3890
03:46:49,700 --> 03:46:50,860
Taste the front wall?

3891
03:46:50,980 --> 03:46:51,400
I did.

3892
03:46:52,140 --> 03:46:52,860
Taste delicious?

3893
03:46:53,200 --> 03:46:53,580
Fantastic.

3894
03:46:55,480 --> 03:46:58,920
Look at all this clean, clean, clean...

3895
03:46:58,920 --> 03:47:00,360
Front window frames?

3896
03:47:07,620 --> 03:47:08,060
Nice.

3897
03:47:11,440 --> 03:47:12,360
I'm gonna go up.

3898
03:47:13,380 --> 03:47:14,120
I'm gonna go up.

3899
03:47:15,740 --> 03:47:16,760
You guys, it's fine.

3900
03:47:16,800 --> 03:47:18,060
I used soap earlier, remember?

3901
03:47:19,340 --> 03:47:20,420
It should be fine.

3902
03:47:21,080 --> 03:47:21,980
I used soap.

3903
03:47:22,580 --> 03:47:22,900
Right?

3904
03:47:23,000 --> 03:47:23,360
It's okay.

3905
03:47:24,140 --> 03:47:26,680
I used soap to...oh, dang it.

3906
03:47:26,680 --> 03:47:28,300
Let's move this.

3907
03:47:32,500 --> 03:47:34,000
I used soap to clean it.

3908
03:47:34,440 --> 03:47:37,020
It should be all clean now.

3909
03:47:37,680 --> 03:47:38,920
To lick...

3910
03:47:39,680 --> 03:47:42,400
You could eat anything off of it.

3911
03:47:42,800 --> 03:47:43,440
Now.

3912
03:47:44,900 --> 03:47:45,480
Probably.

3913
03:47:50,090 --> 03:47:52,530
Soap can't wash the sins.

3914
03:48:01,050 --> 03:48:02,770
Heart sign somewhere.

3915
03:48:04,310 --> 03:48:05,090
Which one?

3916
03:48:06,870 --> 03:48:09,570
As someone who does this job IRL from time to time...

3917
03:48:09,570 --> 03:48:12,690
I can tell you, less than $200 for all that is insanely cheap.

3918
03:48:13,010 --> 03:48:15,050
Like, that only cover labor a short...

3919
03:48:15,050 --> 03:48:16,590
Cover labor a short driveway.

3920
03:48:17,050 --> 03:48:18,410
Without using any soap.

3921
03:48:20,710 --> 03:48:22,750
You're telling me you don't use soap?

3922
03:48:23,730 --> 03:48:25,010
Wait, which heart is it?

3923
03:48:25,250 --> 03:48:25,810
Am I crazy?

3924
03:48:26,310 --> 03:48:27,370
Did you guys see it?

3925
03:48:28,910 --> 03:48:30,650
Heart sign centers.

3926
03:48:31,130 --> 03:48:31,530
Oh, wait.

3927
03:48:31,890 --> 03:48:32,570
Heart sign.

3928
03:48:32,770 --> 03:48:33,190
Oh.

3929
03:48:34,710 --> 03:48:35,570
Here.

3930
03:48:35,870 --> 03:48:37,490
Oh, the heart sign.

3931
03:48:38,070 --> 03:48:39,850
I thought I was talking about the heart window.

3932
03:48:41,760 --> 03:48:42,730
What a thrill.

3933
03:48:50,770 --> 03:48:52,470
Heart sign poles.

3934
03:49:02,640 --> 03:49:03,500
Okay.

3935
03:49:04,340 --> 03:49:05,540
Candy cane.

3936
03:49:05,540 --> 03:49:05,880
Candy cane.

3937
03:49:11,200 --> 03:49:16,740
I love hearing my armor kind of go clink clink when I jump.

3938
03:49:17,480 --> 03:49:19,020
It was just... Was it both of them?

3939
03:49:19,220 --> 03:49:19,780
Both of them.

3940
03:49:20,260 --> 03:49:21,800
Okay, this one is not clean.

3941
03:49:22,180 --> 03:49:22,700
Where though?

3942
03:49:24,840 --> 03:49:25,760
Where else?

3943
03:49:26,120 --> 03:49:26,560
Oh, here.

3944
03:49:27,040 --> 03:49:28,180
I could barely even see...

3945
03:49:28,180 --> 03:49:29,840
Nobody would even notice that!

3946
03:49:33,550 --> 03:49:35,050
Onion carriage axle.

3947
03:49:35,050 --> 03:49:36,690
Oh, we didn't finish the onion carriage.

3948
03:49:39,010 --> 03:49:39,570
Axle.

3949
03:49:40,970 --> 03:49:41,790
This one.

3950
03:49:44,810 --> 03:49:45,550
Got it?

3951
03:49:47,190 --> 03:49:48,370
Oh my gosh, guys.

3952
03:49:48,430 --> 03:49:48,910
We're like...

3953
03:49:48,910 --> 03:49:50,850
We've been at 99% forever.

3954
03:49:51,450 --> 03:49:52,670
Onion carriage window sill.

3955
03:49:53,790 --> 03:49:54,030
Here.

3956
03:49:58,820 --> 03:49:59,400
Stand up.

3957
03:50:00,660 --> 03:50:01,720
Oh, I see it.

3958
03:50:03,800 --> 03:50:04,360
Okay.

3959
03:50:05,280 --> 03:50:05,940
That's it!

3960
03:50:05,980 --> 03:50:06,240
That's it!

3961
03:50:06,300 --> 03:50:07,800
Onion carriage driver's seat!

3962
03:50:09,780 --> 03:50:11,620
Get me out of here, please!

3963
03:50:12,960 --> 03:50:13,960
The driver's seat?

3964
03:50:21,090 --> 03:50:21,970
Got it?

3965
03:50:23,210 --> 03:50:24,490
Flatbed railings?

3966
03:50:26,070 --> 03:50:27,450
What the hell is that?

3967
03:50:37,010 --> 03:50:38,070
Oh, here?

3968
03:50:43,010 --> 03:50:43,550
Got it?

3969
03:50:44,630 --> 03:50:45,770
Roof icing!

3970
03:50:47,970 --> 03:50:50,250
This one is going to be hard to see because...

3971
03:50:52,570 --> 03:50:55,210
I know we got this one, I'm pretty sure.

3972
03:50:56,210 --> 03:50:58,270
But they're all white, so we don't...

3973
03:50:58,270 --> 03:51:00,110
We're not going to see them glowing very easily.

3974
03:51:01,490 --> 03:51:02,410
I think.

3975
03:51:04,050 --> 03:51:04,950
Okay, here?

3976
03:51:06,970 --> 03:51:08,390
I'm pressing tab.

3977
03:51:09,910 --> 03:51:10,910
Pressing tab.

3978
03:51:15,790 --> 03:51:17,110
So much.

3979
03:51:17,110 --> 03:51:17,170
So much.

3980
03:51:19,950 --> 03:51:20,350
Okay.

3981
03:51:22,650 --> 03:51:25,050
No, we're not going back to that horrible Duloc.

3982
03:51:25,150 --> 03:51:26,130
We're never going back there.

3983
03:51:28,510 --> 03:51:29,470
We're going to get this.

3984
03:51:30,490 --> 03:51:31,370
We're going to get this!

3985
03:51:33,710 --> 03:51:34,310
Come on!

3986
03:51:36,930 --> 03:51:37,690
Where else?

3987
03:51:39,470 --> 03:51:40,610
There's lots of stuff, actually.

3988
03:51:40,770 --> 03:51:41,170
Down here.

3989
03:51:42,250 --> 03:51:43,630
Right here, in the corners.

3990
03:51:43,630 --> 03:51:45,990
Where nobody ever looks.

3991
03:51:47,470 --> 03:51:49,550
Oh my gosh, I'm launching myself.

3992
03:51:50,090 --> 03:51:50,870
I'm crazy.

3993
03:51:51,970 --> 03:51:52,450
Yes!

3994
03:51:53,150 --> 03:51:54,170
Two more?

3995
03:52:01,380 --> 03:52:02,860
This corner.

3996
03:52:04,200 --> 03:52:05,180
Is it underneath?

3997
03:52:13,900 --> 03:52:15,120
We're free.

3998
03:52:15,460 --> 03:52:16,500
That's why I see it.

3999
03:52:19,180 --> 03:52:20,400
I see it.

4000
03:52:21,840 --> 03:52:22,860
I see it.

4001
03:52:24,600 --> 03:52:25,940
I see it.

4002
03:52:27,000 --> 03:52:29,340
I have the power of the sight vision.

4003
03:52:30,080 --> 03:52:30,980
I see it.

4004
03:52:36,560 --> 03:52:40,840
Complete the Hanzo's honeymoon hideaway job!

4005
03:52:47,700 --> 03:52:49,380
Let's watch us do it.

4006
03:52:51,840 --> 03:52:54,340
But not like Shrek and Fiona's do it.

4007
03:52:58,820 --> 03:52:59,960
That's us, baby!

4008
03:53:03,220 --> 03:53:04,320
That's us, baby!

4009
03:53:05,400 --> 03:53:06,040
I have to give it to you.

4010
03:53:06,120 --> 03:53:08,020
It does look maybe a wee bit different now.

4011
03:53:08,320 --> 03:53:09,120
And not in a bad way.

4012
03:53:09,420 --> 03:53:10,940
We might even get our deposit back.

4013
03:53:11,320 --> 03:53:12,340
Still, no time for chat.

4014
03:53:12,580 --> 03:53:16,260
We've got to pack up our things and get out of here before those villagers find out where we've been staying.

4015
03:53:16,680 --> 03:53:19,180
As great as it's been, I can't wait to see my swamp again.

4016
03:53:19,480 --> 03:53:22,500
I just hope we don't come home to any surprises.

4017
03:53:28,220 --> 03:53:29,700
What is Washalot?

4018
03:53:29,860 --> 03:53:30,760
What is this Pokemon?

4019
03:53:31,900 --> 03:53:33,660
Don't just stand there looking all cool and metallic.

4020
03:53:33,840 --> 03:53:34,480
Come on in!

4021
03:53:35,060 --> 03:53:36,920
Don't you worry about that beware ogre sign.

4022
03:53:37,080 --> 03:53:38,020
You're perfectly safe.

4023
03:53:38,320 --> 03:53:39,700
Well, normally you'd be toast.

4024
03:53:40,000 --> 03:53:43,000
But Shrek and Fiona are away on honeymoon, which is just as well.

4025
03:53:44,420 --> 03:53:49,440
You see, me and the gang got a bit carried away at the wedding afterparty when Shrek and Fiona had taken off.

4026
03:53:49,700 --> 03:53:53,580
It would be great if we could, you know, make all that mess go away.

4027
03:53:57,940 --> 03:54:00,180
Washalot is a pun on wash and lancelot.

4028
03:54:00,260 --> 03:54:02,040
Oh, it's me!

4029
03:54:04,640 --> 03:54:06,480
Let's put it this way.

4030
03:54:06,640 --> 03:54:13,520
If Shrek comes back and finds a swamp looking like it's looking right now, I'm going to need a lot more of that flying pixie dust.

4031
03:54:14,600 --> 03:54:15,240
Thanks, Donkey.

4032
03:54:15,900 --> 03:54:16,960
I'm guessing it's Donkey.

4033
03:54:16,960 --> 03:54:17,400
Thank you.

4034
03:54:26,200 --> 03:54:27,980
Oh my gosh, we're here!

4035
03:54:33,720 --> 03:54:34,840
Oh my...

4036
03:54:34,840 --> 03:54:35,400
Wow!

4037
03:54:35,580 --> 03:54:36,360
Oh, Donkey!

4038
03:54:38,280 --> 03:54:40,920
Donkey really... I think it looks better this way.

4039
03:54:41,200 --> 03:54:42,360
Why do we need to change it?

4040
03:54:45,100 --> 03:54:47,420
Can I go... I can go inside!

4041
03:54:49,780 --> 03:54:51,040
Oh my gosh.

4042
03:54:51,320 --> 03:54:52,060
Oh my gosh, wait!

4043
03:54:55,240 --> 03:54:58,380
Wait, Shrek... What the... What is that?

4044
03:54:58,460 --> 03:54:58,940
A fairy.

4045
03:55:03,960 --> 03:55:05,480
Hob's end feet?

4046
03:55:06,700 --> 03:55:08,320
What happened in here?

4047
03:55:10,420 --> 03:55:11,600
On the table?

4048
03:55:17,270 --> 03:55:18,830
Isn't this where it was?

4049
03:55:19,710 --> 03:55:21,290
Wait, where's the kitchen?

4050
03:55:21,490 --> 03:55:22,150
Oh, right here.

4051
03:55:26,760 --> 03:55:29,980
Where Donkey said...

4052
03:55:31,630 --> 03:55:33,490
I'm making waffles!

4053
03:55:35,390 --> 03:55:36,770
I'm making waffles!

4054
03:55:44,500 --> 03:55:45,460
Just like the movie!

4055
03:55:45,760 --> 03:55:47,920
We can reenact all of our favorite stuff!

4056
03:55:49,960 --> 03:55:51,260
Oh my gosh.

4057
03:55:51,540 --> 03:55:52,420
Your helmet airtight?

4058
03:55:52,540 --> 03:55:53,600
You might want to keep that on.

4059
03:55:53,680 --> 03:55:55,540
The air around here gets pretty...

4060
03:55:56,480 --> 03:55:57,020
Beefy?

4061
03:55:58,380 --> 03:56:00,180
I smell like beef.

4062
03:56:00,180 --> 03:56:03,500
I smell like beef.

4063
03:56:04,540 --> 03:56:06,260
Yeah, those gloves too.

4064
03:56:06,460 --> 03:56:08,120
Where are you watching me from, Donkey?

4065
03:56:09,320 --> 03:56:09,820
Come out.

4066
03:56:09,900 --> 03:56:10,900
Can we go in here?

4067
03:56:21,180 --> 03:56:22,020
And the armor.

4068
03:56:25,080 --> 03:56:27,100
We can recreate this too.

4069
03:56:37,530 --> 03:56:38,730
Okay, ready?

4070
03:56:45,300 --> 03:56:47,380
I'm a ghost, it's fine.

4071
03:57:05,740 --> 03:57:07,940
Let's clean this one and then we can sing here.

4072
03:57:21,040 --> 03:57:22,640
Oh wait, why am I doing the inside?

4073
03:57:22,840 --> 03:57:23,500
There we go.

4074
03:57:27,580 --> 03:57:29,160
Gotta make it just like the movies!

4075
03:57:31,620 --> 03:57:32,720
Just like the movies!

4076
03:57:36,280 --> 03:57:38,900
It's a cool place and the city is cool.

4077
03:57:39,760 --> 03:57:40,900
Did they really say that?

4078
03:57:45,300 --> 03:57:47,220
Do they really think that it's gonna get cooler?

4079
03:57:59,130 --> 03:58:00,470
So they say.

4080
03:58:12,440 --> 03:58:15,240
The void.

4081
03:58:16,820 --> 03:58:20,720
Everybody can see in here.

4082
03:58:23,360 --> 03:58:25,280
There's not even toilet paper!

4083
03:58:34,790 --> 03:58:36,270
Oh my gosh.

4084
03:58:38,190 --> 03:58:39,690
Everybody can... Can I get in here?

4085
03:58:41,430 --> 03:58:44,030
Oh my gosh, I'm going into the hole.

4086
03:58:46,710 --> 03:58:48,470
Ideally, there's nobody in the swamp.

4087
03:58:49,410 --> 03:58:50,310
I guess, but look!

4088
03:58:50,630 --> 03:58:51,850
Okay, this is a POV.

4089
03:58:52,770 --> 03:58:55,510
You're squatting on the toilet.

4090
03:58:58,210 --> 03:59:00,090
Anybody can come up through here?

4091
03:59:00,730 --> 03:59:01,710
Just be like, howdy.

4092
03:59:04,930 --> 03:59:06,010
Anybody home?

4093
03:59:06,270 --> 03:59:07,450
Look, there's a hole there.

4094
03:59:20,540 --> 03:59:21,400
Howdy doody.

4095
03:59:24,100 --> 03:59:27,020
Public restrooms in the US also have massive gaps around the door.

4096
03:59:27,120 --> 03:59:28,180
You're so right.

4097
03:59:28,820 --> 03:59:30,960
Oh my gosh, you're so right.

4098
03:59:31,460 --> 03:59:33,460
It's horrible, it's awful.

4099
03:59:33,640 --> 03:59:38,600
If you've never been to a public restroom in the United States, it is an actual culture shock.

4100
03:59:38,920 --> 03:59:41,720
It is actually so horrible.

4101
03:59:41,720 --> 03:59:44,720
And like, always at the airport...

4102
03:59:48,680 --> 03:59:51,760
They're always so wide at the airport specifically.

4103
03:59:54,820 --> 03:59:57,960
And like, I can see people.

4104
03:59:58,120 --> 04:00:00,840
Like, I have to make an active effort not to...

4105
04:00:01,500 --> 04:00:03,920
Not to look for real.

4106
04:00:04,340 --> 04:00:04,700
You know?

4107
04:00:04,880 --> 04:00:06,880
Like, it's just so bad.

4108
04:00:07,620 --> 04:00:08,540
Oh my gosh.

4109
04:00:09,100 --> 04:00:11,300
Like I said, it's actual culture shock.

4110
04:00:11,360 --> 04:00:15,760
I kind of want to clean this off just a little bit for our karaoke.

4111
04:00:16,820 --> 04:00:19,420
Even if we just do a light dows.

4112
04:00:19,960 --> 04:00:22,060
So it looks a little bit more like the movie.

4113
04:00:23,000 --> 04:00:28,280
This is basically like when a film is shot at a location.

4114
04:00:28,920 --> 04:00:30,660
Like a regular house.

4115
04:00:31,020 --> 04:00:35,740
And then someone moves into the regular house and they paint the house color.

4116
04:00:35,740 --> 04:00:36,840
But, you know.

4117
04:00:39,720 --> 04:00:42,280
The AI summary made you low?

4118
04:00:42,480 --> 04:00:42,900
Why?

4119
04:00:43,040 --> 04:00:43,840
What is it saying?

4120
04:00:47,020 --> 04:00:49,760
All that glitters is gold.

4121
04:01:00,310 --> 04:01:01,650
Riaju Buckhut.

4122
04:01:04,790 --> 04:01:06,710
Wow, there is a lot around here.

4123
04:01:09,400 --> 04:01:09,910
Wow.

4124
04:01:10,570 --> 04:01:12,410
Can I clean through here?

4125
04:01:13,850 --> 04:01:15,030
Wow, cool.

4126
04:01:18,480 --> 04:01:19,230
What's this?

4127
04:01:20,350 --> 04:01:22,550
This probably says...

4128
04:01:22,550 --> 04:01:23,950
Minto number one.

4129
04:01:25,590 --> 04:01:27,010
It's a mirror.

4130
04:01:27,470 --> 04:01:28,190
Nevermind.

4131
04:01:30,410 --> 04:01:33,630
Oh my gosh, this is where Shrek bathes.

4132
04:01:39,350 --> 04:01:41,750
This probably says...

4133
04:01:44,070 --> 04:01:48,570
Minto number one.

4134
04:01:48,730 --> 04:01:49,150
Danger.

4135
04:01:52,650 --> 04:01:54,630
This says...

4136
04:01:54,630 --> 04:01:58,030
Mint X Snake forever.

4137
04:01:58,890 --> 04:02:00,610
Beware of...

4138
04:02:05,130 --> 04:02:07,610
This one says...

4139
04:02:11,150 --> 04:02:13,710
This one says, come on in.

4140
04:02:14,470 --> 04:02:15,550
Stay out!

4141
04:02:25,360 --> 04:02:27,060
Who would've thunk, man?

4142
04:02:39,540 --> 04:02:40,560
So close.

4143
04:02:40,860 --> 04:02:42,500
Yeah, so close.

4144
04:02:46,740 --> 04:02:48,640
Like I said, we'll do karaoke soon.

4145
04:02:49,000 --> 04:02:51,600
I just wanna make it look a little bit more...

4146
04:02:51,600 --> 04:02:52,860
Cleaned up, you know?

4147
04:02:53,980 --> 04:02:55,460
Look, we're already so close.

4148
04:02:55,560 --> 04:02:57,460
This looks like a purple tentacle.

4149
04:02:59,520 --> 04:03:03,800
It looks like a purple tentacle, like, reaching from the ground.

4150
04:03:07,320 --> 04:03:08,380
Take your time.

4151
04:03:08,640 --> 04:03:09,180
Thank you.

4152
04:03:19,020 --> 04:03:20,240
Oh, we ran out.

4153
04:03:20,360 --> 04:03:20,860
I just realized.

4154
04:03:21,040 --> 04:03:21,660
Dang it.

4155
04:03:22,040 --> 04:03:23,700
It goes so fast.

4156
04:03:24,800 --> 04:03:26,400
It goes so quickly.

4157
04:03:30,280 --> 04:03:30,560
Let's get out of here.

4158
04:03:33,180 --> 04:03:34,740
One time I was in a public restroom.

4159
04:03:34,900 --> 04:03:37,020
Someone I had unsupervised...

4160
04:03:37,020 --> 04:03:39,620
Oh, someone had unsupervised small children peeping through the gap.

4161
04:03:39,740 --> 04:03:40,820
I had to go yell at their parents.

4162
04:03:41,240 --> 04:03:42,140
Oh, that's awful!

4163
04:03:42,440 --> 04:03:49,620
I haven't had it personally happen, but I've seen people have kids crawl under the gap and everything.

4164
04:03:50,280 --> 04:03:53,220
Why did the mobster keep a live animal next to his locked door?

4165
04:03:54,020 --> 04:03:55,740
It was the donkey!

4166
04:03:59,400 --> 04:04:01,180
That's a good one.

4167
04:04:01,600 --> 04:04:03,340
That was a good one.

4168
04:04:16,730 --> 04:04:18,090
Just a little bit more.

4169
04:04:22,510 --> 04:04:25,090
All this glitter comes off really easily, luckily.

4170
04:04:26,590 --> 04:04:28,750
So, we can just clean it up.

4171
04:04:29,210 --> 04:04:32,830
Make it look almost brand spanking new.

4172
04:04:32,830 --> 04:04:39,680
And sing some songs.

4173
04:04:42,220 --> 04:04:46,200
All that glitters is tree trunk.

4174
04:04:50,080 --> 04:04:51,640
It wasn't gold after all.

4175
04:04:52,020 --> 04:04:52,120
No.

4176
04:04:53,340 --> 04:04:55,060
It's the Great Deku Tree.

4177
04:04:58,980 --> 04:05:00,660
This should be good.

4178
04:05:00,820 --> 04:05:03,420
You probably can't see the rest, maybe.

4179
04:05:07,730 --> 04:05:08,690
Oh, here we go.

4180
04:05:09,070 --> 04:05:09,910
Let's get some of this.

4181
04:05:10,470 --> 04:05:12,070
Just wash it all off.

4182
04:05:12,810 --> 04:05:14,490
Wash it all off.

4183
04:05:14,610 --> 04:05:15,890
Wash it all off.

4184
04:05:18,450 --> 04:05:18,930
Yeah.

4185
04:05:22,650 --> 04:05:23,130
Yeah.

4186
04:05:24,330 --> 04:05:25,810
Alright, let's see from over here.

4187
04:05:31,870 --> 04:05:32,350
See?

4188
04:05:32,530 --> 04:05:33,090
This is doable.

4189
04:05:34,050 --> 04:05:37,170
I do kind of want to get a little bit more of the...

4190
04:05:39,410 --> 04:05:41,010
Of the glitter on the ground.

4191
04:05:41,350 --> 04:05:44,950
Anyway, Shrek asked me to mine the swamp for him while they're on their honeymoon.

4192
04:05:47,490 --> 04:05:48,370
Yeah, and...

4193
04:05:48,370 --> 04:05:49,170
What happened, Donkey?

4194
04:05:51,310 --> 04:05:52,230
Donkey, what happened?

4195
04:05:53,290 --> 04:05:54,550
Donkey, what is all of this?

4196
04:05:55,390 --> 04:05:59,870
He had like a... Just a fairypalooza.

4197
04:06:01,250 --> 04:06:05,790
He didn't ask exactly, but best friends don't have to.

4198
04:06:07,630 --> 04:06:08,110
Okay.

4199
04:06:09,310 --> 04:06:09,790
Unsolicited.

4200
04:06:10,070 --> 04:06:10,370
Okay.

4201
04:06:17,870 --> 04:06:19,710
This isn't his dragon.

4202
04:06:20,270 --> 04:06:26,370
You see, when Shrek saluted as they drove away in the onion carriage, I saw that unmistakable sparkle in his eye.

4203
04:06:26,650 --> 04:06:28,670
It said, Donkey, this is your home too now.

4204
04:06:28,990 --> 04:06:29,630
Watch over it.

4205
04:06:29,850 --> 04:06:31,910
I trust you and believe in you.

4206
04:06:33,290 --> 04:06:35,490
That's a lot to say in just a sparkle.

4207
04:06:45,190 --> 04:06:46,570
This isn't all...

4208
04:06:48,110 --> 04:06:51,450
Donkey's dragon friend, is it?

4209
04:06:54,370 --> 04:06:56,550
Like the Frodo Gandalf sparkle.

4210
04:06:57,450 --> 04:06:58,570
That'll do, Donkey.

4211
04:06:59,390 --> 04:07:00,130
That'll do.

4212
04:07:05,240 --> 04:07:05,960
Wife, you mean?

4213
04:07:06,060 --> 04:07:06,780
Oh, sorry, yes.

4214
04:07:07,060 --> 04:07:07,860
How could I forget it?

4215
04:07:07,920 --> 04:07:08,760
Oh, they did get married!

4216
04:07:09,380 --> 04:07:16,060
Back in the 2000s, as I traveled the world, I used to collect pictures of graffiti inside bathroom stalls, port-a-potties, etc.

4217
04:07:16,060 --> 04:07:18,760
But sadly, that collection was lost.

4218
04:07:20,680 --> 04:07:22,080
I don't get the joke.

4219
04:07:26,610 --> 04:07:27,970
Wait, I don't get it.

4220
04:07:37,260 --> 04:07:38,880
I don't think it was a joke.

4221
04:07:40,220 --> 04:07:40,900
No!

4222
04:07:41,580 --> 04:07:43,140
Your collection was lost!

4223
04:07:45,660 --> 04:07:46,340
No!

4224
04:07:46,340 --> 04:07:48,140
Oh my gosh!

4225
04:07:48,800 --> 04:07:50,560
Here, we'll celebrate.

4226
04:07:51,700 --> 04:07:53,380
I mean, not celebrate, we'll mourn.

4227
04:08:02,620 --> 04:08:04,540
L for lost.

4228
04:08:18,380 --> 04:08:19,000
Was it that?

4229
04:08:39,090 --> 04:08:42,370
This game is really like, once you get going, you just can't stop.

4230
04:08:42,910 --> 04:08:46,910
Don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop cleaning and they don't stop cleaning...

4231
04:08:50,510 --> 04:08:52,990
Guys, I made it relevant to the story!

4232
04:08:54,830 --> 04:08:55,270
Lost!

4233
04:09:06,880 --> 04:09:09,680
Why am I even cleaning up the dirt on the ground?

4234
04:09:09,740 --> 04:09:10,980
It doesn't really make much sense.

4235
04:09:12,240 --> 04:09:13,120
Like all of this.

4236
04:09:13,340 --> 04:09:14,180
It's a swamp.

4237
04:09:14,520 --> 04:09:15,540
It looks natural.

4238
04:09:16,780 --> 04:09:18,680
It looks like it's supposed to be here.

4239
04:09:19,280 --> 04:09:19,680
You know?

4240
04:09:22,800 --> 04:09:26,020
It doesn't... I didn't even know I was supposed to be cleaning this part.

4241
04:09:26,520 --> 04:09:27,420
But it's dirty.

4242
04:09:27,760 --> 04:09:28,520
Yeah, it's a swamp.

4243
04:09:31,420 --> 04:09:32,920
I got rid of the evidence.

4244
04:09:33,260 --> 04:09:33,740
The dragon.

4245
04:09:34,080 --> 04:09:35,320
That was a big old dragon foot.

4246
04:09:35,720 --> 04:09:36,420
I saw it.

4247
04:09:36,960 --> 04:09:37,980
Big old dragon print.

4248
04:09:48,200 --> 04:09:48,920
Oh my goodness.

4249
04:09:49,100 --> 04:09:49,500
There we go.

4250
04:09:57,600 --> 04:09:58,880
Okay, this should be good enough.

4251
04:10:05,480 --> 04:10:06,660
Yeah, good enough.

4252
04:10:08,680 --> 04:10:09,780
Alright guys.

4253
04:10:11,100 --> 04:10:13,040
Let's do some karaoke.

4254
04:10:13,260 --> 04:10:16,940
I know I did some of these songs earlier, but I'm gonna do them again.

4255
04:10:17,300 --> 04:10:18,660
I'm gonna do them again.

4256
04:10:19,740 --> 04:10:24,640
Actually, let's move... Let's move it over like that.

4257
04:10:25,340 --> 04:10:26,320
Yeah, okay.

4258
04:10:26,680 --> 04:10:27,700
And then I'll be here.

4259
04:10:29,460 --> 04:10:30,880
You can tell it's Shrek, right?

4260
04:10:30,880 --> 04:10:31,000
Wait.

4261
04:10:35,200 --> 04:10:41,520
I discovered the Chocomintosong cover you have during the time you were gone years ago.

4262
04:10:41,820 --> 04:10:43,680
But do you think you'd sing it in karaoke sometime?

4263
04:10:44,420 --> 04:10:46,460
Oh maybe, but it's like a two person song.

4264
04:10:49,840 --> 04:10:50,320
Okay.

4265
04:10:52,140 --> 04:10:52,620
Shrek.

4266
04:10:55,100 --> 04:10:55,580
Shrek.

4267
04:11:03,540 --> 04:11:06,580
This is official karaoke, so I have to have reverb on.

4268
04:11:09,820 --> 04:11:10,760
It's coming.

4269
04:11:11,500 --> 04:11:15,020
Wait, this is actual... It said donkey.

4270
04:11:25,380 --> 04:11:26,840
Sing it, Puss!

4271
04:11:32,060 --> 04:11:34,640
It's a duet with Puss in Boots!

4272
04:11:39,520 --> 04:12:24,220
She's got a new addiction For every day and night She'll make you take your clothes off And go dancing in the rain She'll make you live her crazy life But she'll take away your pain Like a bullet to your brain Upside, inside out Living la vida loca She'll push and pull you down Living la vida loca Her lips are devil red And her skin's the color of mocha She will wear you out Living la vida loca Living la vida loca Living la vida loca

4273
04:12:30,520 --> 04:12:32,440
Hey donkey, that's Spanish!

4274
04:12:32,620 --> 04:12:33,060
Where?

4275
04:12:34,720 --> 04:12:35,680
What?

4276
04:12:38,400 --> 04:12:52,600
I woke up in New York City In a funky cheap motel She took my heart and she took my money She must have slipped me a sleeping pill Wait, this is your part.

4277
04:12:53,440 --> 04:12:53,820
Shrek!

4278
04:13:03,150 --> 04:13:31,070
Upside, inside out Living la vida loca She'll push and pull you down Living la vida loca Her lips are devil red And her skin's the color of mocha She will wear you out Living la vida loca Living la vida loca Living la vida loca Come on!

4279
04:13:33,090 --> 04:13:34,170
Oh,

4280
04:13:39,110 --> 04:13:43,790
she's living la voca Why aren't you saying your part, Puss in Boots?

4281
04:13:44,910 --> 04:13:45,770
Break it down!

4282
04:13:46,210 --> 04:14:14,610
Upside, inside out Living la vida loca She'll push and pull you down Living la vida loca Living la vida loca She'll push and pull you down Living la vida loca Her lips are devil red And her skin's the color of mocha She will wear you out Living la vida loca

4283
04:14:21,190 --> 04:14:22,550
Shrek, what did you say?

4284
04:14:26,170 --> 04:14:29,470
I can't believe there's a Shrek version of this song Donkey

4285
04:14:41,060 --> 04:14:45,160
This song implies the existence of New York City in Shrekverse It does!

4286
04:14:46,540 --> 04:14:49,200
I can't believe there is a...

4287
04:14:49,200 --> 04:14:56,980
I cannot believe there is a Shrek version of that song Like official What is this one?

4288
04:14:57,220 --> 04:15:04,380
I don't know it, but I'm going to play it Let's see Donkey

4289
04:15:15,020 --> 04:15:19,700
This is like the theme song Party, party, party

4290
04:15:26,580 --> 04:15:27,880
How does this go?

4291
04:15:28,400 --> 04:15:52,100
In the way you look at me There's a smile, there's a truth in your eyes What an unexpected way On this unexpected day Could it mean this is where I belong?

4292
04:15:53,980 --> 04:15:59,660
Is that you loved all along?

4293
04:15:59,780 --> 04:16:00,080
What?

4294
04:16:00,460 --> 04:16:07,320
There's no mystery It is finally clear to me What?

4295
04:16:07,400 --> 04:16:08,160
Is that lyrics?

4296
04:16:08,620 --> 04:16:13,480
My heart searched for so long What?

4297
04:16:13,480 --> 04:16:28,900
And it is you I have loved all along There were times I ran to hide Never showed the other side What?

4298
04:16:30,120 --> 04:17:20,580
I'm too much blown away No, it says Shrek Film Now I know just who you are And I know you hold my heart Finally, this is where I belong Hi and welcome to my membership It is you I have loved all along There's no mystery It is finally clear to me You're the hole my heart searched for So long It is you I have loved all along You

4299
04:17:28,670 --> 04:17:32,410
guys, there's a song from the musical that's called Freak Flag

4300
04:17:36,510 --> 04:17:38,910
Portable hops and a name

4301
04:17:44,870 --> 04:18:39,890
Over and over I'm filled with emotion Your love, it rushes through my veins And I am filled with sweetest devotion As I, I look into your perfect face There's no more mystery This is finally clear to me You're the hole my heart searched for So long And it is you I have loved It is you I have loved I don't know what I...

4302
04:18:51,770 --> 04:18:56,370
Harry Gregson Williams worked on the Shrek OST and backing music?

4303
04:18:56,550 --> 04:19:11,430
Yes Shrek and Metal Gear Solid are tangentially related They are connected Can you believe?

4304
04:19:13,390 --> 04:19:15,950
I'm a believer

4305
04:19:24,250 --> 04:20:10,140
I thought love was only true in fairy tales Meant for someone else but not for me Love was out to get me Now that's the way it seems Disappointment haunted all my dreams And then I saw her face Now I'm a believer Not a trace of doubt in my mind I'm in love I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried God,

4306
04:20:10,240 --> 04:20:19,040
love was more or less a given thing The more I gave, the less I got Oh, yeah!

4307
04:20:21,160 --> 04:20:22,960
What's the use in trying?

4308
04:20:23,960 --> 04:20:33,220
All you get is pain When I wanted sunshine, I got rain And then I saw her face!

4309
04:20:33,980 --> 04:20:42,900
Now I'm a... not a trace No, no, no, no, I'm doubting my mind I'm

4310
04:20:46,860 --> 04:20:52,680
a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried And then I

4311
04:21:02,780 --> 04:21:06,740
saw her freak What's the use in trying?

4312
04:21:07,640 --> 04:21:17,300
All you get is pain When I wanted sunshine, I got rain And then I saw her face!

4313
04:21:18,030 --> 04:21:25,820
Now I'm a believer Not a trace I'm doubting my mind

4314
04:21:30,120 --> 04:21:35,750
I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried And

4315
04:21:38,940 --> 04:21:54,780
then I saw her freak Now I'm a believer Not a trace I'm doubting my mind Now I'm a believer Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

4316
04:21:59,080 --> 04:22:00,600
Then I saw her freak!

4317
04:22:04,920 --> 04:22:06,340
I'm a believer!

4318
04:22:10,740 --> 04:22:12,520
Not a trace!

4319
04:22:13,760 --> 04:22:15,540
Na, na, na, na, na!

4320
04:22:16,480 --> 04:22:18,080
I doubt in my mind!

4321
04:22:28,660 --> 04:22:29,040
Yeah.

4322
04:22:31,400 --> 04:22:33,600
What other songs are from Shrek?

4323
04:22:33,840 --> 04:22:34,680
Wait, what's the one?

4324
04:22:35,460 --> 04:22:37,960
You guys said about something...

4325
04:22:41,160 --> 04:22:41,640
Um...

4326
04:22:43,400 --> 04:22:43,880
Uh...

4327
04:22:46,300 --> 04:22:48,240
Oh, Accidentally in Love, thank you.

4328
04:22:49,560 --> 04:22:50,740
I don't know that one.

4329
04:22:51,480 --> 04:22:52,920
But, we'll try it.

4330
04:22:55,820 --> 04:22:56,920
This one, maybe?

4331
04:22:57,340 --> 04:22:58,360
Tell me if I'm right or wrong.

4332
04:22:58,420 --> 04:22:59,580
I might recognize it.

4333
04:23:00,140 --> 04:23:02,000
Is it from the original one?

4334
04:23:04,340 --> 04:23:04,920
Is it?

4335
04:23:12,160 --> 04:23:13,220
Second movie.

4336
04:23:18,190 --> 04:23:19,720
Wait, I think I might know this one.

4337
04:23:22,180 --> 04:23:24,360
So, what's the problem, baby?

4338
04:23:24,940 --> 04:23:25,920
What's the problem?

4339
04:23:26,220 --> 04:23:28,440
I don't know, but maybe I'm in love.

4340
04:23:28,620 --> 04:23:30,440
Think about it every time.

4341
04:23:30,560 --> 04:23:33,220
Think about it, can't stop thinking about it.

4342
04:23:33,440 --> 04:23:36,660
How much longer will it take to cure this?

4343
04:23:37,060 --> 04:23:39,720
Just to cure it, cause I can't ignore it.

4344
04:23:39,720 --> 04:23:40,960
If it's love, love.

4345
04:23:42,560 --> 04:23:43,640
That makes me...

4346
04:23:43,640 --> 04:23:45,720
I don't know nothing about love.

4347
04:23:47,080 --> 04:23:48,440
Come on, come on.

4348
04:23:48,640 --> 04:23:50,400
Turn a little faster.

4349
04:23:50,720 --> 04:23:51,760
Come on, come on.

4350
04:23:51,920 --> 04:23:53,760
The world will follow after.

4351
04:23:54,120 --> 04:23:55,320
Come on, come on.

4352
04:23:55,480 --> 04:23:58,680
But as everybody's after love.

4353
04:24:05,600 --> 04:24:07,640
I'm a snowball running.

4354
04:24:07,640 --> 04:24:10,100
Running down into the spring.

4355
04:24:10,180 --> 04:24:11,900
That's coming, all this love.

4356
04:24:12,140 --> 04:24:14,000
Melting under blue skies.

4357
04:24:14,120 --> 04:24:15,460
Belting out sunlight.

4358
04:24:15,920 --> 04:24:17,200
Shimmering love.

4359
04:24:17,600 --> 04:24:19,740
Well, baby, I surrender.

4360
04:24:20,200 --> 04:24:21,740
To strawberry ice cream.

4361
04:24:21,940 --> 04:24:22,720
Mint ice cream.

4362
04:24:23,120 --> 04:24:24,160
And all this love.

4363
04:24:24,920 --> 04:24:26,660
But I didn't mean to do it.

4364
04:24:26,820 --> 04:24:29,380
But there's no escaping your love.

4365
04:24:30,420 --> 04:24:32,820
These lines of lightning.

4366
04:24:33,180 --> 04:24:35,080
We were never alone.

4367
04:24:35,260 --> 04:24:35,980
Never alone.

4368
04:24:36,560 --> 04:24:37,360
No, no.

4369
04:24:37,360 --> 04:24:38,760
Come on, come on.

4370
04:24:38,860 --> 04:24:40,600
Move a little closer.

4371
04:24:40,920 --> 04:24:42,160
Come on, come on.

4372
04:24:42,280 --> 04:24:44,120
I wanna hear your whisper.

4373
04:24:44,460 --> 04:24:45,660
Come on, come on.

4374
04:24:46,000 --> 04:24:48,620
Settle down inside my love.

4375
04:24:51,380 --> 04:24:52,620
Come on, come on.

4376
04:24:52,760 --> 04:24:54,480
Jump a little higher.

4377
04:24:54,840 --> 04:24:55,980
Come on, come on.

4378
04:24:55,980 --> 04:24:58,020
If you feel a little lighter.

4379
04:24:58,400 --> 04:24:59,540
Come on, come on.

4380
04:24:59,760 --> 04:25:02,700
We were once upon a time in love.

4381
04:25:07,360 --> 04:25:09,700
We're accidentally in love.

4382
04:25:09,900 --> 04:25:13,120
I don't remember it so well, but I'm trying.

4383
04:25:14,400 --> 04:25:26,820
Accidentally in love.

4384
04:26:13,000 --> 04:26:15,120
Wow, this song is so cute.

4385
04:26:18,420 --> 04:26:20,000
This song is so cute.

4386
04:26:21,480 --> 04:26:23,680
Let's do another Shrek 2 song.

4387
04:26:30,290 --> 04:26:31,970
I sang both of these next two.

4388
04:26:31,970 --> 04:26:33,390
Actually, I think I sang all of these ones.

4389
04:26:34,030 --> 04:26:42,750
Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods?

4390
04:26:44,130 --> 04:26:52,070
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?

4391
04:26:53,210 --> 04:27:00,510
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?

4392
04:27:01,610 --> 04:27:11,390
Late at night, I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need.

4393
04:27:11,950 --> 04:27:13,110
Hit it, boys!

4394
04:27:16,210 --> 04:27:17,950
I need a hero.

4395
04:27:18,790 --> 04:27:22,590
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night.

4396
04:27:23,050 --> 04:27:28,870
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast and he's gotta be fresh from the fight.

4397
04:27:28,870 --> 04:27:30,870
I need a hero.

4398
04:27:31,570 --> 04:27:35,350
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light.

4399
04:27:35,850 --> 04:27:41,670
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon and he's gotta be larger than life.

4400
04:27:42,290 --> 04:27:44,890
Larger than life.

4401
04:27:55,290 --> 04:28:00,530
Somewhere after midnight, in my wildest fantasy.

4402
04:28:01,510 --> 04:28:07,870
Somewhere just beyond my reach, there's someone reaching back for me.

4403
04:28:08,610 --> 04:28:13,990
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat.

4404
04:28:14,940 --> 04:28:20,950
It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet.

4405
04:28:33,330 --> 04:28:38,430
Mountains meet up above and where the lightning splits the sea.

4406
04:28:39,070 --> 04:28:43,850
I could swear that there's someone somewhere watching me.

4407
04:28:44,350 --> 04:28:45,370
It's you guys!

4408
04:28:45,370 --> 04:28:51,750
Through the wind and the chill and the rain and the storm and the flood.

4409
04:28:51,850 --> 04:28:56,430
I can feel his approach like the fire in my blood.

4410
04:28:59,010 --> 04:29:00,770
You're watching the stream!

4411
04:29:00,770 --> 04:29:02,610
You're watching the stream!

4412
04:29:08,070 --> 04:29:08,270
Hero!

4413
04:29:35,430 --> 04:29:37,210
I need a hero.

4414
04:29:38,130 --> 04:29:41,750
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light.

4415
04:29:42,070 --> 04:29:48,210
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon and he's gotta be larger than life.

4416
04:29:54,800 --> 04:29:55,400
Now!

4417
04:29:55,700 --> 04:29:56,160
Hero!

4418
04:29:56,640 --> 04:29:57,240
Nevermind!

4419
04:30:16,750 --> 04:30:22,550
Oh he's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast and he's gotta be fresh from the fight.

4420
04:30:22,870 --> 04:30:24,190
I need a hero!

4421
04:30:28,900 --> 04:30:30,480
I forgot to do it.

4422
04:30:30,820 --> 04:30:31,500
She forgot.

4423
04:30:31,840 --> 04:30:33,200
I even just did it earlier.

4424
04:30:36,060 --> 04:30:37,360
I'm trying to see what other songs.

4425
04:30:38,260 --> 04:30:39,780
What is bad reputation?

4426
04:30:44,920 --> 04:30:46,440
I don't know it.

4427
04:30:46,440 --> 04:30:48,100
I'm gonna listen to it and see.

4428
04:30:48,200 --> 04:30:48,800
Maybe we know.

4429
04:30:51,340 --> 04:30:52,920
What is my backup call there?

4430
04:31:09,870 --> 04:31:12,530
I don't give a damn about my reputation.

4431
04:31:14,570 --> 04:31:17,110
You're living in the past of a new generation.

4432
04:31:19,330 --> 04:31:21,610
A girl can do what she wants to do.

4433
04:31:21,610 --> 04:31:23,570
That's what I'm gonna do.

4434
04:31:23,830 --> 04:31:26,330
I don't give a damn about my reputation.

4435
04:31:28,610 --> 04:31:29,650
Oh no.

4436
04:31:30,970 --> 04:31:31,930
Not me.

4437
04:31:33,630 --> 04:31:35,990
I don't give a damn about my reputation.

4438
04:31:38,450 --> 04:31:40,690
Never said I wanted to prove my sensation.

4439
04:31:42,970 --> 04:31:47,710
I'm only doing good when I'm having fun and I don't have to please no one.

4440
04:31:47,710 --> 04:31:50,210
I don't give a damn about my reputation.

4441
04:31:50,290 --> 04:31:51,410
I can't say this.

4442
04:31:52,630 --> 04:31:52,930
No.

4443
04:31:54,550 --> 04:31:55,610
Not me.

4444
04:31:57,130 --> 04:31:57,950
Oh no.

4445
04:31:59,250 --> 04:32:00,170
Not me.

4446
04:32:01,890 --> 04:32:04,210
I don't give a damn about my reputation.

4447
04:32:06,490 --> 04:32:08,990
I've never been afraid of any deviation.

4448
04:32:11,230 --> 04:32:13,610
I don't really care if you think I'm strange.

4449
04:32:13,730 --> 04:32:16,010
I ain't got a chance.

4450
04:32:16,010 --> 04:32:18,070
I don't really care about my reputation.

4451
04:32:22,890 --> 04:32:23,730
No, not me.

4452
04:32:25,230 --> 04:32:26,110
Oh no.

4453
04:32:28,110 --> 04:32:29,070
Not me.

4454
04:32:30,470 --> 04:32:31,430
Hello boys.

4455
04:32:40,000 --> 04:32:41,440
I don't give a damn about my reputation.

4456
04:32:42,200 --> 04:32:43,500
I can sing this the right way.

4457
04:32:43,820 --> 04:32:45,660
The world's in trouble and there's no communication.

4458
04:32:46,320 --> 04:32:47,600
I'm not singing this right at all.

4459
04:32:48,440 --> 04:32:50,660
And everybody can say what they want to say.

4460
04:32:50,780 --> 04:32:52,600
It never gets better anyway.

4461
04:32:53,000 --> 04:32:55,380
So why should I care about my damn reputation?

4462
04:32:57,140 --> 04:32:59,080
Anyway, not even close.

4463
04:32:59,180 --> 04:32:59,440
No.

4464
04:33:00,340 --> 04:33:01,360
Not me.

4465
04:33:02,280 --> 04:33:03,360
Oh no.

4466
04:33:04,620 --> 04:33:05,700
Not me.

4467
04:33:07,060 --> 04:33:09,500
I don't give a damn about my bad reputation.

4468
04:33:11,760 --> 04:33:14,180
Living in the past is a new generation.

4469
04:33:16,080 --> 04:33:18,820
And I only feel it when I got no pain.

4470
04:33:19,000 --> 04:33:20,420
That's how I'm gonna stay.

4471
04:33:21,060 --> 04:33:23,480
And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation.

4472
04:33:25,380 --> 04:33:26,360
Oh no.

4473
04:33:28,060 --> 04:33:28,700
Not me.

4474
04:33:30,140 --> 04:33:31,280
Oh no.

4475
04:33:32,860 --> 04:33:33,820
Not me.

4476
04:33:35,200 --> 04:33:36,180
Not me.

4477
04:33:48,020 --> 04:33:49,880
It's punk so...

4478
04:33:49,880 --> 04:33:52,340
So it's okay if I sing it wrong?

4479
04:33:52,860 --> 04:33:53,160
Yippee!

4480
04:33:53,240 --> 04:33:56,100
It's punk to sing it incorrectly too you guys.

4481
04:34:00,340 --> 04:34:02,280
Break stuff is also in check.

4482
04:34:02,280 --> 04:34:03,980
I don't think so.

4483
04:34:05,900 --> 04:34:07,100
I don't think so.

4484
04:34:08,500 --> 04:34:10,800
I don't give a damn about my bad reputation.

4485
04:34:15,260 --> 04:34:16,860
What did I not sing?

4486
04:34:17,060 --> 04:34:17,780
Oh, this one.

4487
04:34:19,040 --> 04:34:19,780
Okay, two left.

4488
04:34:21,060 --> 04:34:22,960
Or rather, I have sung this one but earlier.

4489
04:34:23,100 --> 04:34:25,280
And I kind of messed it up so...

4490
04:34:37,390 --> 04:34:42,110
But you don't really care for music, do ya?

4491
04:34:43,870 --> 04:34:45,830
It goes like this.

4492
04:34:46,010 --> 04:34:47,430
The fourth, the fifth.

4493
04:34:47,670 --> 04:34:50,670
The minor fall, the major lift.

4494
04:34:50,950 --> 04:34:54,690
The baffled king composing Hallelujah.

4495
04:34:57,130 --> 04:34:58,050
Hallelujah.

4496
04:35:09,070 --> 04:35:10,410
It's too loud.

4497
04:35:13,740 --> 04:35:17,100
Your faith was strong but you needed proof.

4498
04:35:17,100 --> 04:35:20,620
You saw her bathing on the roof.

4499
04:35:20,740 --> 04:35:25,580
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya.

4500
04:35:27,080 --> 04:35:30,380
She tied you to a kitchen chair.

4501
04:35:30,920 --> 04:35:33,960
She broke your throne as she cut your hair.

4502
04:35:34,260 --> 04:35:38,200
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.

4503
04:35:44,550 --> 04:35:47,290
I think I was just singing off the top of my head.

4504
04:35:47,590 --> 04:35:48,410
Hallelujah.

4505
04:35:57,500 --> 04:36:00,740
Maybe I've been here before.

4506
04:36:00,880 --> 04:36:03,900
I know this room, I've walked this floor.

4507
04:36:04,340 --> 04:36:08,940
I used to live alone before I knew ya.

4508
04:36:10,360 --> 04:36:14,200
I've seen your flag on the marble arch.

4509
04:36:14,500 --> 04:36:17,360
Love is not a victory march.

4510
04:36:17,580 --> 04:36:21,380
It's cold and it's a broken Hallelujah.

4511
04:36:23,660 --> 04:36:24,500
Hallelujah.

4512
04:36:40,620 --> 04:36:43,850
There was a time you'd let me know.

4513
04:36:43,950 --> 04:36:47,250
What's really going on below.

4514
04:36:47,470 --> 04:36:52,290
But now you never show it to me, do ya?

4515
04:36:56,210 --> 04:37:00,450
Moved in you, the holy dove was moving too.

4516
04:37:00,950 --> 04:37:04,690
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah.

4517
04:37:24,500 --> 04:37:27,200
Maybe there's a God above.

4518
04:37:27,480 --> 04:37:30,700
And all I ever learned from love.

4519
04:37:30,700 --> 04:37:35,860
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew ya.

4520
04:37:37,040 --> 04:37:40,740
And it's not a cry you can hear at night.

4521
04:37:40,860 --> 04:37:43,940
It's not somebody who's seen the light.

4522
04:37:44,180 --> 04:37:47,960
It's cold and it's a broken Hallelujah.

4523
04:38:25,990 --> 04:38:30,050
Thanks guys for watching me play Powerwatch Simulator Shrek Edition.

4524
04:38:33,130 --> 04:38:36,610
The final song, of course, is the song.

4525
04:38:39,290 --> 04:38:40,770
Thanks for hanging out with me.

4526
04:38:41,110 --> 04:38:41,850
And let's go.

4527
04:38:42,710 --> 04:38:43,610
Let's go!

4528
04:38:45,630 --> 04:38:46,650
Beautiful Hallelujah.

4529
04:38:46,830 --> 04:38:47,350
Thank you!

4530
04:38:52,530 --> 04:38:56,770
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me.

4531
04:38:57,050 --> 04:38:59,850
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.

4532
04:39:01,090 --> 04:39:05,850
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb.

4533
04:39:06,010 --> 04:39:09,330
In the shape of an L on her forehead.

4534
04:39:10,550 --> 04:39:13,250
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming.

4535
04:39:13,610 --> 04:39:15,570
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.

4536
04:39:15,870 --> 04:39:17,910
Didn't make sense not to live for fun.

4537
04:39:18,090 --> 04:39:20,190
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.

4538
04:39:20,490 --> 04:39:22,490
So much to say, so much to do.

4539
04:39:22,650 --> 04:39:24,150
So anyway, I did the wrong part.

4540
04:39:24,870 --> 04:39:26,610
Never know if you don't go.

4541
04:39:27,150 --> 04:39:29,070
You'll never shine if you don't glow.

4542
04:39:29,070 --> 04:39:31,450
Hey now, you're an all star.

4543
04:39:31,730 --> 04:39:33,970
Get your game on, go play.

4544
04:39:34,110 --> 04:39:36,110
Hey now, you're a rock star.

4545
04:39:36,350 --> 04:39:38,570
Get the show on, get paid.

4546
04:39:38,990 --> 04:39:41,430
All that glitters is gold.

4547
04:39:42,330 --> 04:39:46,210
Only shooting stars break the mold.

4548
04:39:47,550 --> 04:39:50,170
Hey, it's a cool place and they say it gets colder.

4549
04:39:50,410 --> 04:39:52,450
You're bundled up, now wait till you get older.

4550
04:39:52,530 --> 04:39:54,230
But the meteor men beg to differ.

4551
04:39:54,510 --> 04:39:56,490
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture.

4552
04:39:56,730 --> 04:39:58,810
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin.

4553
04:39:58,810 --> 04:40:01,070
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim.

4554
04:40:01,190 --> 04:40:03,390
My world's on fire, how about yours?

4555
04:40:03,650 --> 04:40:05,810
That's the way I like it and I never get bored.

4556
04:40:06,670 --> 04:40:08,450
Hey now, you're an all star.

4557
04:40:08,730 --> 04:40:09,830
Get your game on, go play.

4558
04:40:11,090 --> 04:40:13,130
Hey now, you're a rock star.

4559
04:40:13,290 --> 04:40:15,690
Get the show on, get laid.

4560
04:40:16,530 --> 04:40:18,890
All that glitters is gold.

4561
04:40:19,290 --> 04:40:23,090
Only shooting stars break the mold.

4562
04:40:25,050 --> 04:40:25,290
Hey

4563
04:40:44,130 --> 04:40:45,450
now, you're an all star.

4564
04:40:45,450 --> 04:40:47,910
Get your game on, go play.

4565
04:40:48,130 --> 04:40:49,930
Hey now, you're a rock star.

4566
04:40:50,270 --> 04:40:52,470
Get the show on, get laid.

4567
04:40:52,830 --> 04:40:55,870
All that glitters is gold.

4568
04:40:56,290 --> 04:40:58,230
Only shooting stars.

4569
04:40:59,430 --> 04:41:03,470
Somebody once asked, Could I spare some change for gas?

4570
04:41:03,510 --> 04:41:07,170
I need to get myself away from this place.

4571
04:41:08,150 --> 04:41:10,190
I said, yep, what a concept.

4572
04:41:10,670 --> 04:41:12,630
I could use a little fuel for myself.

4573
04:41:12,630 --> 04:41:17,410
And we could all use a little change.

4574
04:41:17,550 --> 04:41:20,250
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming.

4575
04:41:20,490 --> 04:41:22,470
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.

4576
04:41:22,770 --> 04:41:24,730
Didn't make sense not to live for fun.

4577
04:41:24,910 --> 04:41:27,070
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.

4578
04:41:27,310 --> 04:41:29,030
So much to do, so much to see.

4579
04:41:29,130 --> 04:41:31,350
So what's wrong with taking the back street?

4580
04:41:31,750 --> 04:41:33,430
You'll never know if you don't go.

4581
04:41:33,850 --> 04:41:35,890
You'll never shine if you don't glow.

4582
04:41:36,570 --> 04:41:38,330
Hey now, you're an all star.

4583
04:41:38,610 --> 04:41:40,890
Get your game on, go play.

4584
04:41:40,890 --> 04:41:43,030
Hey now, you're a rock star.

4585
04:41:43,330 --> 04:41:45,170
Get the show on, get paid.

4586
04:41:45,970 --> 04:41:48,990
All that glitters is gold.

4587
04:41:49,270 --> 04:41:53,150
Only shooting stars break the mold.

4588
04:41:54,630 --> 04:41:57,710
And all that glitters is gold.

4589
04:41:58,610 --> 04:42:02,510
Only shooting stars break the mold.

4590
04:42:04,470 --> 04:42:05,610
Thank you!

4591
04:42:06,450 --> 04:42:07,270
Thanks guys!

4592
04:42:07,930 --> 04:42:08,490
Otsumito!

4593
04:42:09,130 --> 04:42:10,230
Thank you for the stream!

4594
04:42:10,930 --> 04:42:12,590
Thanks for the Shrek karaoke!

4595
04:42:13,410 --> 04:42:14,530
Bye bye!

4596
04:42:14,650 --> 04:42:16,530
They don't stop coming, they don't stop coming!

4597
04:42:17,990 --> 04:42:20,830
World chaos, reverse world chaos fits perfectly in the instrumental break.

4598
04:42:24,410 --> 04:42:24,970
OK.

4599
04:42:25,990 --> 04:42:26,410
Bye!
