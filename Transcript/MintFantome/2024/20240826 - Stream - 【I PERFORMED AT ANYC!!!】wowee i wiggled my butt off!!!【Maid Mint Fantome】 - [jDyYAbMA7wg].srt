1
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,130
Your mint-o-phone is ringing.

2
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,650
Your mint-o-phone is ringing.

3
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,010
Pick it up.

4
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,370
Pick up your mint-o-phone.

5
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,950
Your mint-o-phone is ringing.

6
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,130
Blalalalalalalalalala.

7
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,050
Wrong number.

8
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,590
Beep.

9
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,550
Beep.

10
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,490
Beep.

11
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,990
Welcome back, master.

12
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,730
If I sound stuffy...

13
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,850
Because I am.

14
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,110
I'm cold.

15
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,010
Thank you.

16
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:44,310
Thank you.

17
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,350
Thank you.

18
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,250
Hello?

19
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,050
I'm a ghost.

20
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,050
I have a cold.

21
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,650
Not another travel cold.

22
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,410
I can't stop getting sick.

23
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,130
Actually, I told Sakana.

24
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,510
I was just like...

25
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,970
Hey man, I'm sick again.

26
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,210
And he was just like...

27
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,810
He was like...

28
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,750
How did that happen?

29
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,650
And I'm like...

30
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,030
Thank you.

31
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,450
Thank you.

32
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,070
I'm a Vtuber.

33
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,830
I have poor body constitution.

34
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,230
Good performance.

35
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,610
The first opening anime is Kobayashi's Dragon Maverick.

36
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,310
Great and cute.

37
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,310
You did such a great job.

38
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,390
Thank you.

39
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,310
You have a bad connection.

40
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,870
Sakana is built like a pig.

41
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,390
Damn.

42
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,110
Damn, Leo.

43
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,510
Damn.

44
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,470
Damn.

45
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,090
Oh my god.

46
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,070
So I...

47
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,930
Oh my gosh.

48
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,830
Leo was there too.

49
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,550
I was gonna say I.

50
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,230
But we.

51
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,910
I mean, I wasn't just...

52
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,970
It wasn't just she and I.

53
00:04:59,130 --> 00:04:59,490
It was...

54
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,610
It was all of us.

55
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,070
We did a concert.

56
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,210
Yippee.

57
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,110
Today's stream isn't gonna be...

58
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,350
Super duper long.

59
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,610
Because I probably need to rest a little bit more.

60
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,070
But...

61
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,410
Yeah.

62
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,930
Did you guys see it?

63
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,990
I have some video of the concert.

64
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,470
Like from the audience.

65
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,030
So if you were there.

66
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,430
You will recognize it.

67
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,870
And if you only got to watch through the...

68
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,030
Through the live stream.

69
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,410
You'll be able to see what the audience was like too.

70
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,310
You kinda sound sick.

71
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,070
Yeah, I'm sick.

72
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,050
I'm sick.

73
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,110
Yeah, I'm sick again.

74
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,850
I can't stop getting sick.

75
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,950
Even Matara was like, how'd this happen?

76
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,030
And I was like, I don't know.

77
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,330
I don't...

78
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,810
I just don't touch grass.

79
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,710
Miralette, thank you so much for the pic.

80
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,410
It was cool seeing Chibi Minto on stage with the face.

81
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,870
Girls, I hope you get over your cold soon.

82
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,010
Thank you.

83
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,430
It's so funny too.

84
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,430
Because when I'm in Japan.

85
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,050
I'm always...

86
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,990
I'm always...

87
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,650
What's the word?

88
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,030
I'm always...

89
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,830
I have the most vitamins that I have usually throughout like the whole year.

90
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,190
All the fans are so cool.

91
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:25,650
Oh my gosh.

92
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,030
Anthony.

93
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,450
Sakana sent me like a picture of you.

94
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,410
He sent me a picture and was just like, hey, it's this guy again.

95
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,850
He got your...

96
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,290
He got your...

97
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:40,670
Your...

98
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,650
Your pull in the gacha.

99
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,910
And I was just like, oh, it's Anthony.

100
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,650
And he was like...

101
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,910
He was like, is that Solid Snake's name?

102
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,810
And I was like, no.

103
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,470
Sakana.

104
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,230
That's Solid Snake.

105
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,170
He was like, oh, okay.

106
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,650
Solid Anthony.

107
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,390
ZZ, thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

108
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,150
Thank you.

109
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,010
Getting a cold after such a stressful event is such a relatable day.

110
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,430
I know.

111
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,470
I think I like stressed myself out to it for real.

112
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,150
And Solvin, thank you so much for the alcohol.

113
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,870
Watching you sing and dance yesterday was so great.

114
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,830
I can really feel how much you've been putting into your dancing especially.

115
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,550
I always love your singing.

116
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,650
Your dancing was so good.

117
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,890
I absolutely need a full 3D Minto concert.

118
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,390
Thank you.

119
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:37,670
I...

120
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:38,950
I...

121
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,490
I put out a tweet earlier actually of like...

122
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,190
And it actually has nothing to do with the concert itself.

123
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:55,110
It's just that the timing for things that I'm planning and then the finishing of the concert just sort of aligned perfectly.

124
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,770
But hopefully one day I get to have full 3D.

125
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,710
So sorry if I kind of...

126
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,250
We were joking.

127
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,310
I was like, I kind of look like a mascot.

128
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,170
Like when we were like doing rehearsal and stuff.

129
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,950
I was like...

130
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,070
Minto-dayo.

131
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,870
Minto-dayo.

132
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,070
Like Miku-dayo, you know?

133
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,210
But instead I was like Minto-dayo.

134
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,790
You gotta live more filthy to get that immune system built.

135
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,430
I think my brain's got that perfectly down.

136
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,010
Bye, Anaro.

137
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,010
Thanks for the five crypto.

138
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:34,650
Thank you.

139
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,870
But...

140
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:39,930
So...

141
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,150
It was so much fun.

142
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,470
Oh my gosh.

143
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,990
Security was not ready for the power of Hamtaro.

144
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,430
That was such an incredible moment.

145
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,490
I can't wait...

146
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,670
Oh my gosh, I have video of it.

147
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,510
I can't wait to show.

148
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,570
I can't wait to show.

149
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,870
But I want to talk like a little bit first.

150
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,330
Or maybe I should like show video and then talk.

151
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,690
Basically, I performed three songs.

152
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,370
I started with Fansa.

153
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,750
And then I did Aozora no Rhapsody.

154
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,470
Which is the...

155
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,490
Which is the...

156
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,630
Maid Dragon.

157
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,650
The Kobayashi Maid Dragon opening.

158
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,290
And then I finished...

159
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,050
We did encore.

160
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,710
All of us.

161
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,930
And I was singing the Hamtaro.

162
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:28,430
And...

163
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,670
You know...

164
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,390
I...

165
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,310
I don't know if I ever mentioned this before.

166
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,270
But when...

167
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,210
I was asked to join this concert.

168
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,070
I didn't think that I would be it.

169
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,390
The only...

170
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:43,570
Guest.

171
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,210
I was...

172
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,190
I basically...

173
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,990
I was just like...

174
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,570
Oh...

175
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,790
They were like...

176
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,050
Do you want to be a part of this concert?

177
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,150
As a guest.

178
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:53,870
And I was like...

179
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,470
Sure.

180
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,250
And then I was like...

181
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,090
Wait, I'm the only guest.

182
00:09:59,170 --> 00:09:59,930
Special guest.

183
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,470
I thought maybe there would be...

184
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,770
Some other people there.

185
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,810
So it ended up being...

186
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,550
FaZe Connect plus Mint.

187
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,290
So it was kind of...

188
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,910
It was kind of funny.

189
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:20,770
But...

190
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,870
Everybody was so nice.

191
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,210
And...

192
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:24,810
Oh...

193
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,930
Like I...

194
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,670
Here, hold on.

195
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,410
I kind of blurred out some parts.

196
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,110
Because I wasn't sure if...

197
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,630
Oh wait, I forgot to save it.

198
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,410
I wasn't sure if like...

199
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,790
The bento box would...

200
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,050
Give any sort of location stuff away.

201
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,530
Um...

202
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,650
Hold on, hold on.

203
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,270
This is so cute.

204
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,730
When we went to like...

205
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,410
See the spawn people and everything.

206
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,390
And they gave us...

207
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,970
Like little onigiri and stuff.

208
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,450
And it says...

209
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,370
Welcome to Japan.

210
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,630
This is onigiri rice ball.

211
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,090
And I was like...

212
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,350
That's so cute.

213
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,850
And then like...

214
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,750
Feel free to eat if you like.

215
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,050
And it was so sweet.

216
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,510
And I was like...

217
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,570
Aw, it's so cute.

218
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,030
I had to take a picture.

219
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:11,810
And then on the left...

220
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,190
The big black thing...

221
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,970
Like I said, it's a...

222
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,230
It's a chicken bento.

223
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,930
But I didn't know if the...

224
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,470
Location of it...

225
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,970
Was kind of like...

226
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,770
You know...

227
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,670
Like would give away any sort of locations.

228
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,070
Or like, you know...

229
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,850
The look of it...

230
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,970
Would give away any sort of location stuff or whatever.

231
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,470
So um...

232
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:29,450
Yeah!

233
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,730
They prepared that for us.

234
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,110
It was really cute.

235
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,930
Thank you for all the super chats, you guys!

236
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:37,490
See you next time!

237
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,210
Thank you for the wonderful performance.

238
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,010
It made me so happy to see you that I cried.

239
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,330
No!

240
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,090
KT!

241
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,630
Don't cry!

242
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,850
Bento was the special guest.

243
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,950
It was me, the special guest.

244
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,150
Jelly filled donuts.

245
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:51,510
I know.

246
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,730
Trust me, I thought about it.

247
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,670
I was just like...

248
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,190
Oh my gosh!

249
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,790
They had jelly doughnuts!

250
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,870
But yeah.

251
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,250
I recognize that chicken.

252
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,470
You know what I mean!

253
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,470
Like if you were a chicken, you would be like...

254
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:15,590
If someone recognizes the outside of the bento, you know it was all wrapped up, okay?

255
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,470
I'm just being safe.

256
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:24,510
Being there in person was truly an enchanting experience, especially with other Wisps and Faves fans.

257
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,850
Hope you enjoyed our Wotagei shenanigans.

258
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,230
I did!

259
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,490
Thank you!

260
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,010
Oh my gosh.

261
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,410
Manatee, thank you for the dead gift!

262
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,010
Thank you!

263
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,630
Hold on, I have to drink some water.

264
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,570
The medicine here that, like, they have in Japan...

265
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,970
Like, when they're just like, hey, you want to stop your runny nose?

266
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,750
It dries everything.

267
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,930
Like, my whole mouth becomes so dry.

268
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,290
But my nose is still congested!

269
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,850
Yes, I've been taking my meds.

270
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,270
But yeah...

271
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,270
Can't wait for Mint's solo concert.

272
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,930
Oh my gosh.

273
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,430
That would be the day, huh?

274
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,030
No, I...

275
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,110
I was very, you know, very honored to be invited to this.

276
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:28,850
And, you know, honestly, like, when going indie, I was like...

277
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,030
I was like...

278
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:41,870
You know, when going indie, I was like, will I ever have an opportunity, you know, to do something like this?

279
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:48,550
So, you know, the fact that it came, and also came so soon...

280
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,670
I was like, I wish I had had a full 3D prepared, but...

281
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,530
Unfortunately, I had to hold off 3D stuff.

282
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,490
And it was all kind of last minute, too.

283
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,510
They, like, asked...

284
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,570
They were like, do you want to join?

285
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,970
I was like, sure!

286
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,790
And they were like, okay, we're booking everything now!

287
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,110
We need everything now!

288
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,750
Get us everything now!

289
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,530
And I was like...

290
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,160
But I was like...

291
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,670
Hold on.

292
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,050
Oh my gosh, my throat is so sore now that I'm talking.

293
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,670
I mean, not sore, dry.

294
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,550
But I was like, you know...

295
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,550
I was like...

296
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,570
What was I saying?

297
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,230
Oh!

298
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,130
I was like, well, it's 3D...

299
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,010
So...

300
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,830
I should sing songs that, like...

301
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,110
I can really move around in.

302
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,610
And so...

303
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,790
You know, I chose FANZA because I thought that was a song...

304
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,610
I always...

305
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,910
I sing FANZA a lot at concerts because I feel like it's a song that...

306
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,110
A lot of people know.

307
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,270
Very easy to do calls, too.

308
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,850
And so...

309
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,390
I'm always thinking of calls.

310
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,610
When I pick my setlist...

311
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,210
My water brain just...

312
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,890
It's just like...

313
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,010
What songs can you do the most with the gate to?

314
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:10,690
So...

315
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,610
I picked that.

316
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,170
And then...

317
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,490
And then for...

318
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,030
I was on a Rhapsody.

319
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,010
I was on a Rhapsody.

320
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,530
It's a very special song to me as well.

321
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,310
And I was like...

322
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,610
Well, I can actually, like...

323
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,850
Kind of do the dance to it.

324
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,230
You know?

325
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:27,970
Because...

326
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,190
I will be in 3D.

327
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:31,810
So...

328
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,350
Um...

329
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,470
I thought you sang FANZA because it's fancy.

330
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:35,970
No!

331
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,950
FANZA stands for fan service.

332
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,470
It's about like an idol giving fan service during...

333
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,010
You know...

334
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,010
You know...

335
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,410
Being...

336
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,590
She's just like...

337
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,750
Fan service to the fans.

338
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,510
But...

339
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,210
Yeah.

340
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,870
And then...

341
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,910
And then...

342
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,070
Um...

343
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,990
And then, of course, Hamtaro.

344
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,130
Which is like...

345
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:05,310
So...

346
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,030
Which is so...

347
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,590
Like...

348
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,050
So fun.

349
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,890
I wasn't actually sure if people would be able to...

350
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,850
Run around...

351
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,670
At all.

352
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,450
But I was just like...

353
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,690
Of course, you can at least do the calls.

354
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,090
But then when I saw that people were running around too...

355
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,830
I was just like...

356
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,670
No way!

357
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,370
It's happening!

358
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,410
The Hamtaro circle!

359
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,250
And it was so big!

360
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,350
It was an amazing experience to share with Wisps and others.

361
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,410
Being able to participate in a Hamtaro circle is a dream come true!

362
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,030
I'm so happy!

363
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,570
Cause like...

364
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,170
I have so many...

365
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,330
So many...

366
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,850
And like...

367
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,070
You know...

368
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,530
Hamtaro is not a very long song.

369
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,130
So I was like...

370
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:49,930
Maybe...

371
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:50,910
Maybe...

372
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,890
It's not the best song to sing at a concert.

373
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,410
But whatever.

374
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:54,750
Whatever.

375
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,670
And um...

376
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,250
Uh...

377
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:58,790
But...

378
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:00,850
Um...

379
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,770
What was I saying?

380
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,550
Oh gosh, sorry.

381
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,250
The concert was so amazing!

382
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,910
Thank you, Pinto!

383
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:07,750
Thank you!

384
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:09,870
I was...

385
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,130
Oh!

386
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,550
Yes!

387
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,750
I remember what I was saying.

388
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,790
I have so...

389
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,910
So many memories of doing Hamtaro.

390
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,310
But like...

391
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,890
It would be like a friend...

392
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,350
A friend group of like...

393
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,290
10...

394
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,450
15 of us.

395
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:21,730
You know?

396
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,250
Like...

397
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,330
I've never in my...

398
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,570
Ever...

399
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,310
You know...

400
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,170
Only in my dreams would I imagine doing such a...

401
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:28,230
Only in my dreams would I imagine doing such a...

402
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,230
Such a big...

403
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,270
Huge...

404
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,130
Hamtaro circle with so many people!

405
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,390
So...

406
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,030
Even for me, it was a dream come true.

407
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:38,850
Oh my gosh!

408
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,410
I was like...

409
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:39,950
No way!

410
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,750
It's so huge!

411
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,870
It was so much fun!

412
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,810
We even sucked some staff into the Hamtaro circle.

413
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,330
Let's go!

414
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,310
I have...

415
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,970
I have footage of it that I'll...

416
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,590
That I'll be showing you guys.

417
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,350
Because...

418
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,690
It's so...

419
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,310
Oh my gosh.

420
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,210
It's so...

421
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:04,090
I literally have not been able to stop smiling or thinking about it because it's just...

422
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:04,810
And...

423
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,410
I've just been really happy that...

424
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,310
Like I said...

425
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,370
Like going indie.

426
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,030
I'm not sure if these kinds of opportunities will come, but...

427
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,670
And...

428
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,770
Oh gosh, I'm extra stuffed.

429
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,010
Oh my gosh.

430
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,470
I know that the timing was kind of hard too because...

431
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,250
It kind of was like back to back with...

432
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,090
Breaking Dimensions, but...

433
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,490
Still so many people showed up.

434
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,810
So...

435
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,310
YouTuber fans were eating good this weekend, huh?

436
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:06,430
Mucus.

437
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,930
Yeah, I'm full of it.

438
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,910
I'm full of so much mucus.

439
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,130
But...

440
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,410
It was so funny actually.

441
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,770
So actually...

442
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,490
One of the...

443
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,810
So for...

444
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,590
We had to record some of the...

445
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,390
So I recorded you know like the backing vocals for...

446
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,310
Aozora No Rhapsody.

447
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,330
Actually... it was so embarrassing.

448
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:49,850
Because, oh my gosh, did you guys know?

449
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:57,570
Okay, so we get through all of the ad-libs, no, not ad-libs, all of the, you know...

450
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,510
Just those parts and the songs and the choo-choo yeahs and everything like that.

451
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:17,510
And we get to one last part of the chorus, you know, like there's little parts that they say in the backgrounds of the chorus.

452
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:23,550
And the sound guy in the studio, he's just like, okay, now it's this last one.

453
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,670
Hold on, let me look up the lyrics real quick.

454
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,630
So I don't mess up exactly what they say.

455
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,790
Like, yeah, they'll say like, please stay with me.

456
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,710
Or, nante tate, congratulations.

457
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,470
Things like that.

458
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:42,610
And...

459
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,830
The last one that I had to record was the guy, was the sound guy.

460
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,630
He was Japanese, obviously, we recorded it in Japan.

461
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,970
And he was just like, okay, for the last one is...

462
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,030
Make me rhapsodic.

463
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,290
And I was like, huh?

464
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,270
I was like, what?

465
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,770
And he was just like, yeah, make me rhapsodic.

466
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,290
And I was like, what do you mean?

467
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,830
And it's not even like...

468
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,530
It's like...

469
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,070
So we had to explain to him...

470
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,210
That I was basically like singing this bad word.

471
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,890
And it goes up really high and I have to hold it.

472
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,710
So I'm just like...

473
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,550
Make me rhapsodic.

474
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,810
And I'm just like...

475
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,910
I'm like shouting dick in the sound booth.

476
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,930
And I'm like, no!

477
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,110
I could barely get through it.

478
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,290
And I had to keep repeating it over and over again.

479
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,330
I was like, this is not even a real word.

480
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,370
This is not even a...

481
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:57,670
I don't...

482
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,430
Is it a real word?

483
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,130
Actually, I don't even know.

484
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,470
Rhapsodic.

485
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,450
Rhapsodic.

486
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,250
Oh, maybe it is.

487
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,110
Wait, it's a book.

488
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,270
What is the meaning of rhapsodic?

489
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,510
Extravagantly enthusiastic.

490
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:12,670
Ecstatic.

491
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,130
Why couldn't they say make me enthusiastic instead?

492
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,730
I get that it's Aozora no Rhapsody.

493
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,250
I think it's rhapsodic.

494
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,710
Like emphasis on the soul.

495
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,170
Yeah, but that's not how it goes in the song.

496
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:31,930
Hahaha.

497
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:32,470
Hahaha.

498
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,470
Oh, rhapsod...

499
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:37,790
Rhapsodic.

500
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,210
Yeah, but in the song, they say rhapsodic.

501
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,590
They're just like, make me so rhapsodic.

502
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,430
That's how it goes in the song.

503
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,780
So you can blame Fana.

504
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,280
Not, not, ugh, Fana.

505
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,420
But Fana the band.

506
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,280
Oh my gosh.

507
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,060
You did an amazing job performing on stage.

508
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,260
I'm so glad to see you sing your heart out up there.

509
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,340
Thank you.

510
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:12,800
I love you too.

511
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,780
Too.

512
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,420
Basically, Mint played the pee-pee game by herself.

513
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,960
But instead of shouting pee-pee, it's...

514
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,120
No!

515
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,770
Is that a noun or an adjective?

516
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,710
It says it's an adjective.

517
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,890
Rhapsodic.

518
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:31,750
Rhapsodic?

519
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:32,710
Hahaha.

520
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,750
Yeah, so that was really embarrassing.

521
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,690
And I'm just like, I'm like singing it.

522
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:51,190
And I'm just like staring up at the ceiling trying to avoid any eye contact from everybody in the studio.

523
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:57,450
And I look over and everybody's just like, like they're all like giggling at me.

524
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,350
And I'm just like, I hate this.

525
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,410
I hate this.

526
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,290
But another thing that I recorded was...

527
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,170
I actually also recorded the Hamtaro.

528
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,450
Because what I wanted to do was...

529
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,070
I wanted to do the calls live.

530
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,250
So I actually recorded me singing it.

531
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:21,090
And then the calls were done live for the show.

532
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,190
So kind of the opposite.

533
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,650
I got to have my own little WOTA moment too.

534
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,950
But I remember we had a...

535
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,470
I record things with a vibe gifted.

536
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,470
It's like episodic.

537
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,690
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

538
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,370
But still, why?

539
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,630
But still, why?

540
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:47,650
But...

541
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,570
What was I saying?

542
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,760
Yeah.

543
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,300
Oh, so I recorded that.

544
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,380
And we had the translator guy.

545
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,560
We had a guy who was helping us translate.

546
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:06,980
And...

547
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,640
After I...

548
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,340
I did Hamtaro in one take.

549
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,600
And I was just like, yeah baby.

550
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:14,940
Let's go.

551
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,240
They were like, that's good.

552
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,260
One take.

553
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,840
Easy done.

554
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,400
And afterwards...

555
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,880
The translator, he was just like...

556
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,740
It was so good, actually.

557
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,600
You sounded exactly like a kindergartner.

558
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,780
I was like, what do you mean by that?

559
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,840
He was just like, your pronunciation, you know?

560
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,240
And the way that you sang it and stuff.

561
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,700
Sounded very good, like a kindergartner.

562
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,160
I was like, are you saying that?

563
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,420
I was like, what?

564
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,180
What?

565
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,340
What pronunciation?

566
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,140
He was like, the way you were pronouncing it.

567
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,200
You know, you made it sound like a kindergartner.

568
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,500
I was like, that's just how I...

569
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,720
That's just how I talk, sir.

570
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,780
And he was like, ah.

571
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,240
Well, it fit the song.

572
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,860
I was like, I didn't...

573
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,380
I didn't add anything special to it.

574
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,100
I'll never forget this weekend.

575
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,140
Thank you, Min.

576
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,020
Thank you, Kiriha.

577
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,920
Oh, you take those.

578
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,760
That was the first VTuber concert I've been to.

579
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,480
And it was a lot of fun.

580
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,300
Oh, my gosh.

581
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,080
Thank you, Min.

582
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,820
Couldn't think of a better way to end my time at Anime NYC.

583
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,260
Thank you.

584
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,700
Thank you so much.

585
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,900
It means a lot.

586
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,850
So, let's watch some video from the concert as well.

587
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,410
Because, let's see.

588
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,730
I don't want to start with the Hamtaro.

589
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,890
I have some other things out here.

590
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,670
I'm going to pause the music real quick.

591
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,350
And...

592
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,390
Let's see.

593
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,010
What do I want to start with?

594
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,750
Let's start with Fine Sound because that's what I started with too.

595
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,830
Oh, my gosh.

596
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,210
Okay.

597
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,890
I have some other stuff that I want to...

598
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,030
Okay.

599
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,390
Hold on.

600
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,770
Let's start with this.

601
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,210
Okay.

602
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,590
Let me know if it's too loud or...

603
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:12,910
Hold on.

604
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:13,850
Actually.

605
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,750
One second.

606
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:16,670
I'm scared.

607
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,230
I'm scared it's going to be really loud.

608
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,230
If it's too loud, I'm sorry.

609
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:27,810
Okay.

610
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,390
Let's try it.

611
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:31,850
Yeah.

612
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:35,650
Okay.

613
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,910
So, I was like...

614
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,570
Oh, my gosh.

615
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,930
We have this whole stage, right?

616
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,850
I was like, I need to...

617
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,250
Like, it was...

618
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,210
You know, my first time...

619
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,930
Having such a big stage before.

620
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:55,490
And I was like, oh, I want to like fill up the whole stage.

621
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,390
I want to make sure the people on the left can see me.

622
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,230
I want to make sure the people on the right can see me.

623
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,070
I want to make sure everybody can see me.

624
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,390
So, I was just like dashing.

625
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,310
I was mad dashing side to side.

626
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,690
I was like...

627
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:15,390
And the poor cameraman is like also trying to keep up with my freak.

628
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,190
He's just like unable to...

629
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,070
He's

630
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:29,290
like unable to keep up with me because I'm like literally all over the place.

631
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,410
I was like, I got to make sure everybody can see me.

632
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,350
I was just so excited.

633
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,210
Okay.

634
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:49,230
And then I was just like, okay, I should probably tone this down for Aozora Rhapsody.

635
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,470
The guy, the cameraman was just like...

636
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,390
He looked a little...

637
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:55,990
He looked a little...

638
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:56,930
He looked a little tired.

639
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:04,690
So, but I was just like, I just want to make sure everybody can see.

640
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,730
But now, looking at it now, I look like...

641
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,790
I'm like a creature.

642
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,550
I'm like a cretin like running from...

643
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,590
Why am I so dramatic?

644
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,730
Look at the way I run.

645
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,310
Oh my gosh.

646
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,670
I'm getting such secondhand embarrassment.

647
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,150
Look at this.

648
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,030
Oh, I don't...

649
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,150
Okay, sorry.

650
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,530
I was so like...

651
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,130
Hold on.

652
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,530
Oh, you could see it here, really.

653
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,210
Oh, where did the music go?

654
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,470
There we go.

655
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:44,430
I'm like, mad dashing over there.

656
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,090
I like, I ran, ran.

657
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,830
I was not even like dancing, running.

658
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,110
I was like...

659
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,370
And in the TV, it looks even weirder.

660
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,000
It's so fun.

661
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,780
Look!

662
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,600
Cyclone!

663
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,420
Naisu!

664
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:23,200
Yeah, so fun.

665
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,660
I don't know who took this video.

666
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:29,830
Yay!

667
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,870
So I start with...

668
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,370
Kindergarten running...

669
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,310
Stop!

670
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,290
This is so funny.

671
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,410
I was like...

672
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,130
Oh goodness.

673
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,070
Running man, would have been proud of you.

674
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,410
Oh my gosh, cameraman!

675
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,790
Yeah, thanks a lot.

676
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,330
Getting your steps in that day, cameraman!

677
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,890
So yeah, I did fine so...

678
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,890
And then I...

679
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,450
I had a...

680
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,650
I was on a Rhapsody.

681
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,980
Okay, okay.

682
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,740
I have a problem.

683
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,600
I have a bone to pick with you guys.

684
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,020
I have a real bone to pick with you guys.

685
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,720
What the hell... Hold on, I'm gonna mute it real quick.

686
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,420
What the hell is this ketcha?

687
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,820
What the hell are you guys doing?

688
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,400
Why are you ketcha-ing?

689
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,860
DURING THE CHORUS?!

690
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,740
DID YOU LEARN NOTHING?!

691
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,640
Hold on.

692
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,340
Hold on.

693
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,380
Oh, where did the music go?

694
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,240
This is not a ketcha moment!

695
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,980
Who allowed this?!

696
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,160
JoJo!

697
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,160
DID YOU LEARN NOTHING?!

698
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,600
Oh my gosh.

699
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,500
What a gay lessons win.

700
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,040
I swear, you guys.

701
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,200
I swear!

702
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,280
She hates us.

703
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,600
Just... just...

704
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,440
We're still new.

705
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,040
This is not ketcha!

706
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,080
This is not... this is not when you do ketcha.

707
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,460
This is when you are excited to bull.

708
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,620
And everything!

709
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,560
No ketcha!

710
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,500
No ketcha here!

711
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,280
It is chorus!

712
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,800
It is excitable chorus!

713
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,180
Why is that?

714
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,220
Why are you guys acting like it's a slow part?

715
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,600
There's... I... I don't understand.

716
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,720
Who... who... who... who led this?

717
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,380
Who led this?

718
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,760
We need what a gay lessons stat.

719
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,320
We're learning, okay?

720
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,400
We need what a gay lessons stat!

721
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:09,540
That!

722
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,680
I meant... I don't have a voice anymore because of the concert.

723
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,840
But that's okay because mixing the FANZA for you is the highlight of my year.

724
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,300
Thanks, Ashes!

725
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:21,760
But yeah.

726
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,720
Yeah, I tried to like fill the whole stage.

727
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,800
But it was really big.

728
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,480
Confused but they got the spirit.

729
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,620
Our section was doing the footy copy.

730
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,480
Nice!

731
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,180
I think we were doing something, right?

732
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,440
Yeah, footy copy is okay.

733
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,800
Fairy under the desk said to...

734
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,100
The fairy would never say that.

735
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,860
We need more lessons.

736
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,660
Okay.

737
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,020
Well, I'll give you guys some what a gay lessons, you know?

738
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,680
Okay?

739
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,500
Okay.

740
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,420
No idea what I'm doing with the pen line.

741
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,420
She hates us, Kouru.

742
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:11,740
It was fun.

743
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,840
Ah, I have that too!

744
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,660
There is a video.

745
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,300
Look at this.

746
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,140
This is the encore.

747
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,260
I have actually two...

748
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,800
I have two versions of it.

749
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,940
I have this one first.

750
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,500
This is the one Sakana sent to me.

751
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,300
She hates us.

752
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,460
She hates us.

753
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,440
She hates us.

754
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,680
She hates us.

755
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,940
She hates us.

756
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,160
She hates us.

757
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,600
She hates us.

758
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,080
She hates us.

759
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,560
She hates us.

760
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:45,700
She hates us.

761
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,020
She hates us.

762
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,620
She hates us.

763
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,240
She hates us.

764
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,840
She hates us.

765
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,100
She hates us.

766
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,160
She hates us.

767
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:48,380
She hates us.

768
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:48,400
She hates us.

769
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,460
She hates us.

770
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,680
She hates us.

771
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:59,760
She hates us.

772
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,360
It's so loud!

773
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,820
It's so perfect!

774
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,940
Oh my god!

775
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,840
Why is this the encore all the time?

776
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,600
Why is this the encore?

777
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,400
At least you guys were in sync, right?

778
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,100
Good encore, everybody.

779
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:47,860
Good job.

780
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,760
That, I'm proud of you.

781
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,760
Very proud.

782
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,860
You're very in sync.

783
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,340
Very in sync.

784
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,080
Yes, yes.

785
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,740
Very good, very good.

786
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,240
And then...

787
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,880
And then we did...

788
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,980
I have a couple of...

789
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,560
Oh, I have my MC!

790
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,440
I forgot...

791
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,240
Oh, this one too.

792
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:14,680
Wait.

793
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,040
Wait, I think I forgot to download a video.

794
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,440
I'll download it after.

795
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,240
But this one...

796
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,740
This is after...

797
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,780
Aozora Rhapsody.

798
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,080
How do you like the cult you raised me to?

799
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,960
How do you like the cult you raised me to?

800
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,120
I was one who started the She Hates Us chant instead of an encore.

801
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,080
My B, I didn't think it would catch on.

802
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,540
No!

803
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,960
Why are you saying my B?

804
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,660
It's so funny!

805
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,240
It was the blast of a concert.

806
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,460
You and the other wits made it unforgettable for me.

807
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,900
Oh, thank you!

808
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,900
Thank you so much!

809
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,660
Oh, wait.

810
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,220
My chat got weird.

811
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,560
Hold on.

812
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,000
Xenaph, thanks for the donut too.

813
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,160
Yeah, Gezor, thank you so much!

814
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Hi!

815
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,020
Thank you, thank you!

816
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,720
I went to the concert yesterday.

817
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,800
You and everyone did great.

818
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,160
It was nice to talk to other wisps while waiting in line.

819
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:11,440
Yeah!

820
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,540
I'm so happy!

821
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Thank you, thank you!

822
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,260
And then, oh yeah.

823
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,760
This was after Aozora Rhapsody.

824
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,100
I'm so loud.

825
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,540
Hold on.

826
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,240
Okay, this part too.

827
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,220
Hold on.

828
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,140
Okay, so I go this side.

829
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,560
Yeah!

830
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,060
This side!

831
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,520
Yeah!

832
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,340
And then, you guys...

833
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,370
I was so...

834
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,630
I was so flustered.

835
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,190
I forgot to say the middle!

836
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,460
I was so like...

837
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,180
I forgot to do the middle!

838
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,580
So I only did one side.

839
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,760
And then the other side.

840
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,360
I forgot to say the middle.

841
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,120
I'm sorry!

842
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,680
I'm sorry!

843
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,640
Oh my gosh!

844
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,840
Did you guys have fun?

845
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:15,590
Yeah!

846
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,910
Look at all the mint pen lights!

847
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,090
It looks so good!

848
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,090
It's so pretty!

849
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,870
Oh my gosh!

850
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,370
I'm very honored to have been...

851
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,010
And then it cuts off.

852
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,870
Cameraman hates MC.

853
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,610
Oh gosh!

854
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,050
I can't believe I forgot!

855
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:37,890
Look at this!

856
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,440
Everyone in the middle waiting for their choice.

857
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,900
For their...

858
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,820
For their chance to cheer.

859
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,200
Oh my gosh!

860
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,240
And I just forget!

861
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,060
The

862
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,120
middle!

863
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,760
Anybody seen it in the middle?

864
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,050
They're all just like...

865
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:20,470
Okay!

866
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,970
There's one guy who's probably just like...

867
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,290
Sorry, I'm really snotty.

868
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,790
He's got his hands up.

869
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,210
He's got his pen lights.

870
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,150
He's just like...

871
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:29,630
Oh boy!

872
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,010
She's gonna say the middle next!

873
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,090
She's gonna say the middle next!

874
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,090
And that'll be me!

875
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,650
And then I'll cheer too!

876
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,810
And I'll be part of the crowd!

877
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,710
And I just...

878
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,270
I just never...

879
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,030
I'm so sorry.

880
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,270
Next time I'll give extra, extra love to the middle.

881
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:51,890
I'm sorry.

882
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,690
Next time I'll give extra love to the middle.

883
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:00,270
Legend has it the middle election is still waiting for you.

884
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,730
I'm sorry.

885
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,310
I'm sorry.

886
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:07,490
I'm sorry.

887
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,330
Yay!

888
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:10,490
Yay!

889
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,270
See you got to cheer there!

890
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:11,890
Yeah!

891
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,690
That guy's waving his hand really high.

892
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,930
But then...

893
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:17,370
Oh wait.

894
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,330
I think I mislabeled this as Hamtaro.

895
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,730
Oh no, just kidding.

896
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,470
Wait, where is my Hamtaro?

897
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,670
Okay, hold on.

898
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,150
I forgot to save a video.

899
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,390
But I don't remember which one it is.

900
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:30,690
But I don't remember which one it is.

901
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,490
Uh...

902
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,070
One second.

903
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:35,810
Uh...

904
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:38,930
Uh...

905
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:40,930
Uh...

906
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:45,290
Uh...

907
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,190
Uh...

908
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:47,890
Where was it?

909
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:48,350
Hold on.

910
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,270
Which one is it?

911
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,550
Oh, I think it's... hold on.

912
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,790
This one.

913
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,430
I think.

914
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,410
Hold on, let me double check this.

915
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:00,650
Sorry.

916
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:06,320
Did I show this one?

917
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,160
I can't remember what I've shown or not.

918
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,000
Oh, wait.

919
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,280
There was more fun stuff.

920
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,340
Wait, I didn't watch this one.

921
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,620
Oh, I forgot to show this one too.

922
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,720
Hold on you guys.

923
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,460
I forgot two whole videos.

924
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,820
Keep the crowd on their toes.

925
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,440
Yeah, you'll never know when I'm gonna call on you.

926
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,580
I could call just the left side one time.

927
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,380
I could call just the right side sometime.

928
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,340
I could call the back.

929
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,940
I could call the front.

930
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,480
You never know.

931
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,980
You never know.

932
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,560
Running around for Hamtaro was not what I was expecting from this concert.

933
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,360
Well, get used to it, baby.

934
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,560
Because that's just...

935
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,540
That's just how Minto concerts go.

936
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,100
Minto concerts are all about that fun.

937
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,120
This is, you know, I always, you know, I love idols.

938
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,220
And I love Wotage so much.

939
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,820
And I always have wanted to kind of share all of that with you guys too.

940
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:10,220
Especially for people who have never experienced like any kura or any idol kind of stuff before.

941
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,000
So...

942
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,360
You know, when people are just like, Oh my gosh, I got to do a Hamtaro circle.

943
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,640
And it was like so crazy and so fun.

944
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,340
Because it's such like a...

945
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,620
It's such a unifying experience.

946
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:29,320
Especially when a group of people are just able to to like come together and do calls.

947
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,860
At the same time, it's like such a...

948
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,520
Such an electric feeling.

949
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:34,940
You know?

950
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:40,460
And so I've always wanted to really, really share that with people.

951
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,600
So...

952
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:42,840
You know...

953
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,600
The fact that it's spread so much is...

954
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,100
Oh my gosh, it's like the best thing.

955
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,620
It's so much fun.

956
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,760
And you know, people are still learning.

957
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,100
And people are still trying to get the hang of it.

958
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,620
But, you know...

959
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,920
Once you...

960
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,480
Once you get the basics down and...

961
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,160
Like...

962
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,520
Can really kind of get a feel for things.

963
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,560
How to do things.

964
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,400
You can apply it to like any song.

965
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:07,920
It's great.

966
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,180
Real men are born in the Hamtaro circle.

967
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,040
So true.

968
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,880
Thanks for making this weekend unforgettable.

969
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,580
Cheered my heart out at the concert and joined the Hamtaro circle.

970
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,420
Yeah!

971
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,700
So happy.

972
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,600
Here, hold on.

973
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,240
I have some other...

974
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,400
Before I show the Hamtaro circle.

975
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:30,560
Um...

976
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,200
This one's a fan song also.

977
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:36,660
Oh.

978
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,080
Oh, the beginning of the fan song.

979
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,820
Wait, wait, wait.

980
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,260
What was that?

981
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:57,790
Minto.

982
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:57,890
Oh, really.

983
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,030
Did you guys say, Are no Minto?

984
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,340
I twirled!

985
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,400
Oh!

986
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,380
Hi!

987
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,380
Good job, good job!

988
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,320
Oh, my gosh, you guys have PPVH!

989
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,020
Good job!

990
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,620
Good job, good job!

991
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,100
We were yelling calls in the back.

992
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,860
That's usually... Okay...

993
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:43,500
Because they know the calls best, but... and this is probably just mostly with like chika idols and idols in Japan, like underground idols in Japan, but the fans in the back are where it's all at, baby.

994
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,980
That's where like the... that's where all the hype and the party is at.

995
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,960
So, you know, it's the... it's always the... it's always the back.

996
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:09,000
That's... I used to want to be in the front because I'm like, oh my gosh, I'll be so close to my idols, but when you become like a fan for so long, you're just like, nah, the back is where you gotta...

997
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:15,280
So that call you heard, it was definitely a normal ore no minto, nothing else.

998
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,460
What was it?

999
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,280
What did you say?

1000
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,400
What did you say?

1001
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,660
What did you say?

1002
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,940
So my first time going to a VTuber concert, doing calls, oh my gosh, thank you very much!

1003
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,720
August said, me and my wallet cry tears of joy, then why are you super chatting?

1004
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,620
Oh my gosh, but thank you.

1005
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,780
Ore no white girl?

1006
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:39,700
What?

1007
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,440
No way.

1008
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:46,820
I'm listening.

1009
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,340
I'm listening.

1010
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,280
Oh my god, I hear it.

1011
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,320
No, white girl, stop!

1012
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,100
Wait, does that actually hit?

1013
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,900
I hate you guys.

1014
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:03,700
You know what?

1015
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,920
She hates us?

1016
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,500
It's real.

1017
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,000
This is also my first VTuber concert.

1018
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,760
Oh my gosh, no way.

1019
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,720
Thank you.

1020
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,180
I'm honored to be so many people.

1021
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,100
I'm honored to be so many people's first VTuber concert, seriously.

1022
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,580
She hates us.

1023
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,060
Hi, she hates us.

1024
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,380
Hi, she hates us.

1025
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:27,600
She hates us.

1026
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:27,600
Real.

1027
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,560
She hates us.

1028
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:28,900
Real.

1029
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,080
She hates us.

1030
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,080
Real.

1031
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,540
Ore no white girl.

1032
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:41,680
Oh my gosh, but then of course, I have to show the Hamtaro.

1033
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,440
So this one, oh my god, hold on.

1034
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,160
It's, oh my gosh, it's so great.

1035
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,420
It's so good.

1036
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,360
Look at this.

1037
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,220
This is such a highlight for me.

1038
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:58,900
There is aがた.

1039
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:01,840
I'm a person who is talking about something rather than me.

1040
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,540
Oh my gosh.

1041
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,860
Do you have to ride like me?

1042
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,380
You're a human being.

1043
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,140
I'm a human being.

1044
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,960
Yeah, you're like me.

1045
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,340
I'm also like me.

1046
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,240
I'm also like me, too.

1047
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,500
I'm

1048
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:26,770
like you and I'm also like me.

1049
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:28,270
So how do we do this?

1050
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:28,650
I'm like a human being.

1051
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:29,410
I don't understand.

1052
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:29,570
I don't understand.

1053
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:29,710
I'm also like you.

1054
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:29,750
I also like you.

1055
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:30,470
I understand.

1056
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,380
One, two, three, go!

1057
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,400
There are so many people!

1058
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:48,600
Oh my god!

1059
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,660
That's so...

1060
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:57,280
I could not understand the scale until this video.

1061
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,200
Until I was sent this video.

1062
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:05,060
I did not understand how many people were one, there.

1063
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,580
And two, like, participated in the Hamtaro circle.

1064
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,780
No wonder security couldn't stop you guys.

1065
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:18,820
This is what I mean by unleash the yakai in your soul.

1066
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,600
Hold on, I have another one.

1067
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,840
I think this one is another, like, further out video.

1068
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:24,700
Hold on.

1069
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,420
Oh my gosh!

1070
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:34,620
Hi!

1071
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,840
You can hear everybody so well!

1072
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,990
And then I get beat up and I die again.

1073
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:53,910
Yay!

1074
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,770
I actually didn't...

1075
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:04,290
I didn't know if they were gonna wake me up or not.

1076
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,400
Min's next concert stop is Budokan.

1077
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,200
Yeah, right.

1078
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,060
But yeah.

1079
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,740
Hold on, I wanna watch the Hamtaro again.

1080
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,440
I wanna watch the first video again.

1081
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,800
It's too good.

1082
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,180
It's too good.

1083
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,540
Oh, it's so loud.

1084
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,660
You can hear the calls better in the...

1085
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,860
other video, I think.

1086
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,300
Everybody getting their steps in.

1087
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:05,860
Let's go!

1088
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,760
Oh my god!

1089
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,840
It's so awesome!

1090
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,200
There's so many people!

1091
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,260
Oh my gosh!

1092
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,400
I actually...

1093
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,720
So also with this too...

1094
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,560
I was like, I really wanna see if I can make...

1095
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,400
if I can pull Hamtaro off, you know?

1096
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,320
And like, have people go in a circle.

1097
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,900
But originally too...

1098
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,700
it was just supposed to be like...

1099
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,140
an encore song.

1100
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,500
But it was only me.

1101
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,120
And I was just like...

1102
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,840
Well, you know...

1103
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,120
I want the other girls to come out too.

1104
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,320
And we can all run around in a circle together.

1105
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,300
And they were...

1106
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,240
They were kinda confused about the...

1107
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,620
About what I wanted to do.

1108
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,860
I had to like send them...

1109
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,620
Anikura videos and be like...

1110
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,120
This is...

1111
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,600
This is what I want.

1112
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,500
And they were like...

1113
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:03,600
Oh!

1114
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,540
I was like, all you do is...

1115
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,400
run around.

1116
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:08,740
It's...

1117
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,500
Because they were like...

1118
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,900
Do we wanna do like a choreography?

1119
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:11,720
And I was like...

1120
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,080
No.

1121
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,520
I just wanna run in a circle.

1122
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:22,690
I was like...

1123
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:23,770
They were like...

1124
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:25,050
They were like sending...

1125
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:27,050
I think like there's choreography from like...

1126
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,370
On Stars or something.

1127
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:30,150
And I was like...

1128
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,830
No.

1129
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:32,650
Circle.

1130
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:38,910
And so...

1131
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:39,750
I was just like...

1132
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,090
Just be silly and goofy.

1133
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:43,570
And do whatever.

1134
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:44,330
You know?

1135
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:45,350
I was just like...

1136
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:46,350
Don't...

1137
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:46,950
Don't...

1138
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,030
No seriousness.

1139
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:48,950
Only...

1140
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:50,030
Only goofy fun.

1141
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:57,210
Your turn to circle.

1142
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,930
No choreography.

1143
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:01,650
Only circle.

1144
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:03,590
Only circle.

1145
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:05,930
So...

1146
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:06,950
Yeah.

1147
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:07,730
I'm so...

1148
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,050
I'm so happy.

1149
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,290
I ended up working out.

1150
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:11,070
I'm so happy.

1151
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,030
I'm so happy that...

1152
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,830
It seems like so many people had fun.

1153
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,030
I learned the choreo...

1154
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:18,090
The On Stars choreo.

1155
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:18,390
Oh.

1156
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,070
Sorry, Lia.

1157
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:20,910
Only circle.

1158
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:25,990
Only circle, Lia.

1159
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:26,770
Sorry, Lia.

1160
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,070
Only circle.

1161
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:30,250
Sorry, Lia.

1162
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:30,910
Only circle.

1163
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:35,570
Only circle.

1164
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:37,390
Just a circle.

1165
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,450
Can you see it?

1166
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,130
Can you see it?

1167
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:41,050
Can you see it?

1168
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:50,450
I have footage of other people, but I didn't want to show just in case they wanted to show it on their end.

1169
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:54,010
Oh my gosh, but everybody was so fun.

1170
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,030
Everybody was so good.

1171
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,390
Everybody was so cute.

1172
00:52:58,190 --> 00:52:59,990
Oh my gosh, Lia's dancing!

1173
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:08,290
When she was doing Darling Dance, I was like dancing along because I also kind of know that dance.

1174
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:10,410
So I was just like dancing along backstage.

1175
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:11,290
I was like...

1176
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:24,690
Oh my gosh, she sounded so good.

1177
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,310
She looked so good.

1178
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:30,690
Sorry, I came out.

1179
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:32,690
I felt like, I was like, oh my gosh, I have to fall.

1180
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:33,870
I have to come out after her.

1181
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:38,510
And I'm looking like this blobby chibi mess, you know, after she was so good.

1182
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:41,390
But...

1183
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:43,370
You know.

1184
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:45,130
You know.

1185
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:49,970
Sorry that I was a chibi blob.

1186
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:58,390
But Lia's so amazing at dancing, so I'm really glad that she could get 3D and be able to show that off to everybody.

1187
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:02,150
Born idol.

1188
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:02,770
She's idol.

1189
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:10,450
Like, she tweeted that Sakana said to her after he saw her dancing that his idol dream wasn't dead.

1190
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:15,270
But was Faye's ever supposed to be idols?

1191
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:15,850
I wonder.

1192
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,110
Biblically accurate chibimento.

1193
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,210
With my giant hands and everything.

1194
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,750
I feel like I've been chibi for so long at this point.

1195
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:33,190
Going back to normal will be so weird.

1196
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:34,890
You know.

1197
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,510
I've been chibi for so long now.

1198
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:40,410
I don't know what it's like.

1199
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,630
I don't know what it's like to be normal size.

1200
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:49,410
I died in the made-me-into-eventaro mosh pit.

1201
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:52,450
No!

1202
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,340
You're just a ghost just like me now.

1203
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,080
Basically.

1204
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,620
Sakana's dream is coffee.

1205
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,360
I guess so.

1206
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,040
I already forgot what you look like.

1207
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:10,520
Me too.

1208
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,650
Faye's is mainly a coffee company.

1209
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,430
Please understand.

1210
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:18,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1211
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,570
I wanna try it.

1212
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,350
I wanna try it.

1213
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:24,470
Ugh, gosh.

1214
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,590
Ugh, I'm so congested.

1215
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,330
I'm sorry, guys.

1216
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,820
You can use the chibi toggle on your normal model.

1217
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:39,460
No.

1218
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,880
It's not the same.

1219
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,840
Can we order Faye's coffee at your main cafe?

1220
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,080
Um...

1221
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:47,940
We'll see.

1222
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,440
They're gonna ask for a cut, though.

1223
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,080
And, uh...

1224
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,640
Made-me-into-cafe is 100% profits for me.

1225
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,040
So I can fund my idol addiction.

1226
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,980
You know?

1227
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,340
So I gotta...

1228
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:07,820
I gotta...

1229
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:08,980
I gotta get money.

1230
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,040
So then I can give my money to idols, too.

1231
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:12,500
You know?

1232
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,360
So...

1233
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,420
Business is business.

1234
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,400
What can I say?

1235
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:17,760
Yeah.

1236
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,280
Oh, God.

1237
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:18,640
Ugh.

1238
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,420
Let me turn the music back on.

1239
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:32,340
You know when you're so congested and it, like, gets stuck in the back of your throat?

1240
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,380
And you, like, can't...

1241
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,580
get it out of the back of your throat?

1242
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:44,950
That's me right now.

1243
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,060
Yeah.

1244
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,520
Sorry, I'm blowing my nose right now.

1245
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,660
I'm like...

1246
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:55,800
Don't mute the music.

1247
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:56,200
It's okay.

1248
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:56,260
Okay.

1249
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,120
Oh, yeah.

1250
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,400
Ah.

1251
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,640
It feels like you're choking.

1252
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,080
Yes!

1253
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,660
That's how I feel right now.

1254
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:07,400
Ooh!

1255
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,020
Carla Mold!

1256
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,700
Idol live funds.

1257
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:11,400
Thank you!

1258
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,220
Stop!

1259
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:12,640
No!

1260
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,760
Don't fund my addiction!

1261
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,480
Thank you.

1262
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,680
I was actually supposed to go to an idol thing today that I won.

1263
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,960
I, like, won the ticket for it.

1264
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,020
And it was supposed to be...

1265
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,800
You guys, it was supposed to be making pancakes with my Oshii!

1266
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,480
And I couldn't go because I didn't want to get her sick.

1267
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,740
But I missed out on making pancakes with my Oshii!

1268
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,660
I'm so depressed.

1269
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:50,640
Hahaha.

1270
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,480
I even won the ticket.

1271
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:57,820
Ah.

1272
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:00,780
Oh.

1273
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:01,560
Sorry.

1274
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,220
Oh, yeah.

1275
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:09,460
For those who weren't able to go to the concert, I hope that the videos kind of showed you a little bit.

1276
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,260
Sorry.

1277
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,540
I'm choking on my mucus.

1278
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,120
Hahaha.

1279
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:24,750
VOD's still available.

1280
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:25,070
Yeah.

1281
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:25,870
The, um...

1282
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,050
You can still watch the stream.

1283
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:27,390
Yeah.

1284
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:29,470
The stream doesn't show the audience, though.

1285
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:29,950
So...

1286
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:32,190
Um...

1287
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:36,470
But if you want to see it in full, of course, you can still watch the VOD.

1288
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:37,750
And, um...

1289
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,410
I wish it would show the audience.

1290
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:43,950
Maybe next time we can figure out a way to do that.

1291
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:45,330
Um...

1292
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:47,570
Yeah.

1293
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:48,250
Haha.

1294
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:49,750
But it was so much fun.

1295
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:52,010
And I'm just really happy.

1296
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:52,570
Um...

1297
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:56,910
Thank you so much, AnimeMYC and FaZe Connect for having me!

1298
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:58,070
Um...

1299
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,170
I was...

1300
00:58:59,170 --> 00:58:59,710
You know...

1301
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:03,290
Like I said, I was quite surprised to be the only guest, but I was like...

1302
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:04,390
So honored.

1303
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:06,050
I'm so happy.

1304
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:09,290
You're the reason I got to experience the legendary Hamtaro Circle!

1305
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:09,990
Hahaha.

1306
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,010
I cried during Fanta.

1307
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:14,070
It made my eye patch itchy.

1308
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:14,610
Hahaha.

1309
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,010
Thanks, Anthony!

1310
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,790
Thank you so much for the pink!

1311
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:22,790
And, um...

1312
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:23,790
You know...

1313
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:24,750
Um...

1314
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,710
I know that it was also during...

1315
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:28,870
Uh...

1316
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:33,430
During the Hololive concerts, it was kind of in between everything as well.

1317
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:34,870
Um...

1318
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:36,030
Uh...

1319
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,710
But if you were able to go to both...

1320
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:39,850
I hope you had so much fun!

1321
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:42,410
If you were able to go to just one of them...

1322
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,370
Whichever one it was...

1323
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:48,730
I hope you were able to have such a super duper fun time.

1324
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:50,050
And, uh...

1325
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,070
Hopefully, um...

1326
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:54,870
I can get more concerts in the future.

1327
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:56,890
Hopefully, I can get more concerts!

1328
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:59,830
I can get concerts that stop overlapping with other concerts!

1329
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:02,850
Or other events!

1330
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:03,810
Hahaha.

1331
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:09,330
But, you know, that tends to happen at such big events like an anime convention.

1332
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:11,630
There's always going to be something that is, uh...

1333
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,050
That is, uh...

1334
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,050
Overlapping, probably.

1335
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,110
But, um...

1336
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,630
I don't know.

1337
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:23,090
I think I have just bad luck with this kind of stuff.

1338
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:23,710
Hahaha.

1339
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:26,450
Um...

1340
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,310
Bought streaming tickets for both.

1341
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:30,710
Thank you so much!

1342
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:31,510
Thank you!

1343
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:35,010
Thank you, thank you.

1344
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:36,490
Um...

1345
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:37,250
But...

1346
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,390
Yeah, I'll keep doing my best so that...

1347
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:40,030
Um...

1348
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:40,990
More events will...

1349
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:43,770
Hopefully see these kinds of videos and be like...

1350
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:43,870
Wow!

1351
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,270
This is the maid mint...

1352
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:47,050
Power!

1353
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,450
This is her energy!

1354
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:52,430
She can make a whole group of people go into a circle!

1355
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:53,150
Hahaha!

1356
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:55,690
In such a big room!

1357
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:56,430
This is...

1358
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:58,170
With my power!

1359
01:00:58,870 --> 01:00:59,210
Hahaha!

1360
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:03,630
The worst part of a stuffy nose is when one nostril is clear and the other one is blocked.

1361
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:06,370
Both of my nostrils are blocked.

1362
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:10,270
Hahaha!

1363
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:11,330
I saw both.

1364
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:12,650
Thanks for an awesome weekend, Mint!

1365
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,250
Thank you!

1366
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:14,170
Hahaha!

1367
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:18,610
Yeah.

1368
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:19,650
So...

1369
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:20,410
Um...

1370
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,430
I'll keep doing my best.

1371
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:22,730
And, um...

1372
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:23,570
Uh...

1373
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:24,170
Yeah.

1374
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:25,910
If you have a concert...

1375
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:27,310
You want to see me at...

1376
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:27,730
You know...

1377
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:28,050
Just...

1378
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:28,450
You know...

1379
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:28,550
Um...

1380
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,350
Talk to your...

1381
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:30,390
Or not a concert...

1382
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:30,670
A...

1383
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:31,530
Convention!

1384
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:32,830
Just say...

1385
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:32,970
Hey!

1386
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:33,230
Convention!

1387
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:34,990
Please invite...

1388
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:35,650
Maid Mint.

1389
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,070
Though I am trying to kind of slow down a little bit since...

1390
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:40,930
Um...

1391
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:42,530
I think that's why I'm getting sick.

1392
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:43,170
Hahaha!

1393
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:44,510
Hahaha!

1394
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:44,830
Hahaha!

1395
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:45,130
Hahaha!

1396
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:47,590
Because I've been...

1397
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:48,450
Um...

1398
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:50,530
Kind of pushing myself a little bit.

1399
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,510
So...

1400
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:54,670
Uh...

1401
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:55,130
Yeah.

1402
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:55,850
Hahaha!

1403
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:56,330
Hahaha!

1404
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:57,130
Hahaha!

1405
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:58,430
Hahaha!

1406
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,150
Congrats on the concert, Maid Mint!

1407
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:03,050
I wish I could have seen you in the face, girls.

1408
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:03,770
Especially...

1409
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:05,350
Since it's my birthday today!

1410
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:06,410
Wow!

1411
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,010
Solo the Scott!

1412
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:09,310
Happy birthday!

1413
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:13,190
Happy birthday to you!

1414
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,550
Happy birthday to you!

1415
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:17,890
Happy birthday, Solo the Scott!

1416
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:21,870
Happy birthday to you!

1417
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:24,470
Happy birthday!

1418
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:28,070
Um...

1419
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:28,370
Um...

1420
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:28,430
Um...

1421
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:31,330
Maid Mint touring with Limp Bizkit Wood!

1422
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:32,350
Hahaha!

1423
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:33,210
Hahaha!

1424
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,290
That'd be crazy.

1425
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:38,630
Um...

1426
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,290
But yeah!

1427
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:40,390
Thank you guys!

1428
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:41,470
For...

1429
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:42,150
AMYC!

1430
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:43,410
I know this is a shorter stream.

1431
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:44,490
But I gotta...

1432
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:45,450
I gotta pack!

1433
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:46,950
And I...

1434
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:48,510
Because I'm moving hotels soon.

1435
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,330
And I also have to sleep.

1436
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:51,790
So that I can recover.

1437
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,030
And not be...

1438
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:53,690
A...

1439
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:54,430
Um...

1440
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:56,810
Mucusy mess.

1441
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:57,550
Haha!

1442
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:58,410
Too much ectoplasm.

1443
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,510
The concert was legendary!

1444
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:02,630
Went fully Akai!

1445
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:03,690
Hahaha!

1446
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:06,650
My pompadour almost died from trying the other game!

1447
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:07,370
Hahaha!

1448
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:09,350
JP!

1449
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:10,250
You and your...

1450
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:11,610
You and your pompadour.

1451
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:13,250
Do you wear that to every con?

1452
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:14,070
You're crazy!

1453
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:14,910
Hahaha!

1454
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:16,750
Wow!

1455
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:17,350
Thank you!

1456
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:21,490
It was great to see you moving around in 3D!

1457
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:23,730
Can't wait to see you dancing in real 3D someday!

1458
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:24,170
Yes!

1459
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:26,550
And when I get my real 3D!

1460
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:28,410
Let's make a really, really big one!

1461
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,290
Let's make a big event out of it!

1462
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:30,130
Yeah!

1463
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:31,910
Even though I'm indie!

1464
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,470
I will!

1465
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:35,610
Do my best!

1466
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:36,450
To!

1467
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:37,750
Make it!

1468
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:38,330
Really!

1469
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,170
Awesome!

1470
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,580
Congrats on the concert!

1471
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,380
Thank you!

1472
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:50,540
Yeah!

1473
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,380
I wear it to every con!

1474
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:51,720
Man!

1475
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,280
You're crazy!

1476
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,420
Congrats on the concert!

1477
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,220
Can't wait to see more!

1478
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,260
Thanks Chagi!

1479
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:56,240
Hahaha!

1480
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,480
Otsumito guys!

1481
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,040
I will see you guys!

1482
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:01,220
Next stream!

1483
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,320
Whenever I see you!

1484
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:02,960
Whenever!

1485
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:03,760
Um...

1486
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,320
Stay healthy!

1487
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:04,600
Ok?

1488
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:05,140
