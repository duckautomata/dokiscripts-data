1
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,320
Okay.

2
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,900
Yeah.

3
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,120
Hello.

4
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,640
Hello.

5
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,360
One second, I was... I had...

6
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,820
I was doing some stuff on my interface earlier.

7
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,720
And so, my settings are a little different.

8
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,880
Okay.

9
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,200
Okay.

10
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,340
Hello, hello, hello.

11
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,140
Hello.

12
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,520
Welcome back to HoloCure.

13
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,260
Yeah.

14
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,060
Oh my gosh, you guys.

15
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,960
I got new monitors today.

16
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,300
I got new monitors today.

17
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,280
They came in.

18
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,320
I ordered them the other day.

19
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,540
I ordered them the other day.

20
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,140
Because they were on sale for Black Friday.

21
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,440
And...

22
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,080
And I...

23
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,660
I...

24
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,300
Now have 4K.

25
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,020
I didn't have 4K before.

26
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,320
Now I have 4K.

27
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,220
And now I can fit the game...

28
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,040
And chat on the same monitor.

29
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,500
Yeah.

30
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,940
Congrats on your nomination.

31
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,960
Oh, thank you.

32
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,740
Oh, yes.

33
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,520
Yes, you guys, I got nominated.

34
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,940
Oh, sorry.

35
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,480
I got nominated for the VTuber Awards.

36
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,700
I'm...

37
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,220
The category is...

38
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,360
Little lady or...

39
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,000
It's...

40
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,960
Girl.

41
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,840
What's the category?

42
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
Miss VTuber.

43
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:14,820
Yeah!

44
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,700
Miss VTuber.

45
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,060
I don't know what that means.

46
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,920
I don't know.

47
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,680
Nominated for being cute.

48
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,980
You can blame my mama.

49
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,280
It means you're a little lady.

50
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,480
Why isn't it the little lady category then?

51
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,160
Miss VTuber.

52
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,760
What does that mean?

53
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,100
I think there was like a Mr. VTuber.

54
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,820
Today at work I had a call from someone with the surname Kun.

55
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,620
Because of you I had to... Because of me?

56
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,460
What do you mean, me?

57
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,760
What did I do?

58
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,260
I'm just... I guess I'm just...

59
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,000
I love how it's a fashion award category.

60
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,120
And I have won it.

61
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,100
It said, yeah, it was like...

62
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,780
She's dressed.

63
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,600
Yeah, I do have clothes on.

64
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:24,720
Again.

65
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,600
But yeah, it's so exciting.

66
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,640
Wow, thank you for nominating me.

67
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,460
Not all VTubers can say that.

68
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,200
It's so true.

69
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,120
Thanks for everybody for liking my one outfit.

70
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,740
It's my birthday.

71
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,380
Oh my gosh!

72
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:52,840
Winter Seder!

73
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,360
Happy birthday!

74
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,580
Happy birthday to you.

75
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,700
Happy birthday to you.

76
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,820
Happy birthday, Winter Seder.

77
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,140
Happy birthday to you.

78
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,020
Thank you.

79
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,340
7 months.

80
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,260
That's cool!

81
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,820
It's the heart hole panties.

82
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,160
Maybe.

83
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,200
But that's like a lack of clothes, right?

84
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,900
One day I'll get a second outfit for real.

85
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,040
One day.

86
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,200
One day I'll get an actual second outfit.

87
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,680
For real.

88
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,940
Not a 1.0, 2.0, 3.0.

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,420
An actual second outfit.

90
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,920
I've been teasing you guys for 4... Well, I guess 2.0 was a different outfit.

91
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,460
You know.

92
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,020
So, 4.0.

93
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,560
No!

94
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,160
I believe.

95
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,360
Thank you.

96
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,640
You should believe.

97
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,560
It'll happen.

98
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:08,880
Hold on.

99
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,920
Let me change something on my chair.

100
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,980
Hold on.

101
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,100
Hold on.

102
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,120
If you had a casual outfit, what would it be like?

103
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,740
Overalls.

104
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,360
I don't know.

105
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,660
Maybe the overalls.

106
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,340
Probably.

107
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,820
I love overalls.

108
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,620
And I like wearing overalls.

109
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,740
Any update on long hair Minto or twin tail Minto?

110
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,800
Um...

111
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,740
Celia said...

112
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,760
End of November, beginning of October... Beginning of December, able to work on it.

113
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,140
So, maybe.

114
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,760
We'll see.

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,640
Maybe soon-ish.

116
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,440
What job would your outfit be other than maid?

117
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,500
Cashier, OL, race queen?

118
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,340
Well, it could be cashier maid, or OL maid, or race queen maid.

119
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,940
Or any of those kinds of possibilities.

120
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,340
But I'm always a maid, you know?

121
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,760
I have to always be a maid.

122
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,440
Unless it's like casual clothes, but I'm pretty much always on the job.

123
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,200
Kind of.

124
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,780
A maid-maid.

125
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,960
That's what I am now.

126
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,800
Maid-maid.

127
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,100
Well, I'm a ghost maid-maid.

128
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,920
As some people call me maid-mint.

129
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,520
But that's of my own doing.

130
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:47,660
I think.

131
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,680
Oh my gosh, yes, I can be grocery worker maid.

132
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,200
Yeah.

133
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,340
Good.

134
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,870
First name maid.

135
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,870
Last name mint.

136
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,510
Bakery maid.

137
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,870
Cyberpunk maid.

138
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,130
Cat maid.

139
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,990
I want cat ears, but I don't think I can put them on.

140
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:21,590
Right?

141
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,330
Oversized Kermit shirt minto.

142
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,270
Yeah, but I already own that.

143
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,270
I have that for real.

144
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,720
Because if I have cat ears, I think it will...

145
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,720
It'll... my hitaikakushi will block it, right?

146
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,220
It's hard for me to do cat ears.

147
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,200
I don't know how.

148
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,680
I don't know how.

149
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,280
I don't know how.

150
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,750
Anyways, guys.

151
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,810
We're here.

152
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,070
Holocure.

153
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,850
Oh, let me show you some stuff first.

154
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,380
Let me show you.

155
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,420
Oh, no, no, no.

156
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,260
My guys are exhausted.

157
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,260
I haven't fed them in a long time.

158
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,500
Outfit of a zombie.

159
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,300
Of a zombie?

160
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,300
That was my costume for Halloween.

161
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:28,520
Man.

162
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,000
Sneaking maid.

163
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,660
French maid.

164
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,840
I feel like I'm more French maid than traditional maid anyway, though.

165
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,520
Currently.

166
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,720
Guys.

167
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,260
I've almost...

168
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,620
I've almost...

169
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,140
Look at this.

170
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,080
I've crafted...

171
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,740
Well, okay.

172
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,320
Do I need to craft these?

173
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,840
Do I have to craft...

174
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,160
Is there an achievement?

175
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,560
I couldn't find one if there was an achievement for creating all the weapons.

176
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,440
No, just the max one?

177
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,060
Okay.

178
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,040
Well, I have them.

179
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,700
Why is there not an achievement for creating all the weapons?

180
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,920
I mean the tools.

181
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,420
Not weapons, sorry.

182
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,880
Why not?

183
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,440
I've spent so hard thinking...

184
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,420
I've spent so long thinking that there would be an achievement.

185
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,700
But there never was one.

186
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:40,280
And then, for this, the hot babe, I did nothing.

187
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:48,400
I don't even think I stepped foot over here since last stream.

188
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,800
So, there's that.

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,460
Do you have the max prism?

190
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,680
What's the max prism?

191
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,820
Do you try commissions?

192
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,880
I do!

193
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,820
The commissions, like these.

194
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,980
Yeah, I do them sometimes.

195
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,360
When I feel like it.

196
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,520
What's the max prism?

197
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,000
The hololight?

198
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,520
This one?

199
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,000
I haven't made any of these.

200
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,860
Should I?

201
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,920
Should I make this?

202
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,180
Helps on stages.

203
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,340
Well, that's what it says.

204
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,940
7 damage from attacks.

205
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:48,690
But I want to defeat stage 4 on my own without any...

206
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,490
Without any buffs like this.

207
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,830
Because that's how everybody did it in the old days.

208
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,450
So...

209
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:04,350
I want to do it on my own with my own merit and skill.

210
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,710
Real and fair.

211
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,150
I mostly just played Minecraft.

212
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,410
I didn't really go here either.

213
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:17,910
So...

214
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,150
I haven't really done much else.

215
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:21,850
But that's okay.

216
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,030
Oh!

217
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,650
Turn... Wait.

218
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,930
It's day, but I hear the crickets.

219
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,450
You guys hear that?

220
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,190
Isn't that weird?

221
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,880
Day crickets.

222
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,480
The crickets don't sleep in this game?

223
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,100
Oh my god.

224
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,000
Is this guy dead?

225
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,250
No, cicadas are more like...

226
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,730
How does she get in there?

227
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:13,330
I want to go hang out with my slaves, but I don't know how.

228
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,330
I don't know how to get inside.

229
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,310
Bloodloss, how are you doing?

230
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,150
How does she get in there?

231
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,520
How did you get in there?

232
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,540
She spawned in there.

233
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,680
I guess she works for me now.

234
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:33,740
No.

235
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,600
Keep working and I'll feed you.

236
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,120
I only play Minecraft.

237
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,260
And then I also...

238
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,680
So today...

239
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,680
With stage 4...

240
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,060
As you can see, I have not defeated it.

241
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,940
It's so sad.

242
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,680
But I want to defeat it.

243
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,060
And also...

244
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,960
I was thinking of using Kiwawa.

245
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,720
But I need to get her fandom up to Gachikoi fandom.

246
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,800
So I don't know.

247
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,800
Nom, nom, nom.

248
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,950
You've seen the Kiwawa knife?

249
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,950
Oh my gosh, yes!

250
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,630
I messaged her about it actually.

251
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,910
Because I told her that I'm a big fan of...

252
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,110
Anime cutlery and anime bowls.

253
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,490
And I have anime plates and bowls and cups.

254
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,370
And forks and spoons and chopsticks.

255
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,370
So I felt like it was entirely made for me.

256
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,910
I think she loves me or something crazy.

257
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,550
So, yeah.

258
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,930
I haven't ordered it yet, but I'm going to.

259
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,370
I don't really cook.

260
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,670
But I still want the cutting board so bad.

261
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,370
It's so cute.

262
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,150
And the knife is really beautiful.

263
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,270
So, I still want it, but I don't cook.

264
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,300
Maid that can't cook.

265
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,140
Okay you guys, you all have to understand this.

266
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,900
I'm a maid cafe maid.

267
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,480
I'm not like a maid maid.

268
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,120
Like I'm not at some prince's castle or anything like that.

269
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,420
I'm a maid cafe maid.

270
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,100
Where we get the food from the kitchen.

271
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,900
And I give it to the customers and I say, Moe moe kyun and I make it delicious.

272
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,460
That's all I do.

273
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,400
I don't know how to do anything else.

274
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,240
How is it a fake maid?

275
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,460
A maid cafe maid is valid.

276
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,520
Yeah, right?

277
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,740
I have to know how to draw things.

278
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,780
And someone will say, Can you draw me a bunny on my omurice?

279
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,480
And I'll say, Of course, master.

280
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,760
And then I draw it and they'll be like, Wow, it's so cute.

281
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,120
And then we take chukies.

282
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,260
It's like how it is.

283
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,520
You guys wouldn't understand.

284
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,200
I think we should just get into it.

285
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,020
Let's see how far we get.

286
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,620
And how well we do.

287
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,340
And I have my quick dash.

288
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,280
Which I'll try to remember that I have.

289
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,880
And let's just do it.

290
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,160
Let's just get in there.

291
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,800
Yeah.

292
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,120
Slice and dice.

293
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,580
Slice and dice.

294
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,160
Do you put the fries in the bag?

295
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,760
What does that mean anyway?

296
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,980
What does it mean to put the fries...

297
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,520
Like, I mean...

298
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,280
Like, I know what it means.

299
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,740
Literally, but...

300
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,480
Viewers are reacting to Mint's new maid outfit.

301
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,560
Admiring its design and joking about the impracticality of a maid who can't cook.

302
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,260
Messed up.

303
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,380
Minimum wage worker.

304
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,580
But, like...

305
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,760
Why is that a bad thing?

306
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,540
It's like, oh, you put the fries in the bag.

307
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,320
That means he's a minimum wage worker.

308
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,580
I predict...

309
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,740
First try, win easy.

310
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,980
I don't know.

311
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,200
Don't, don't.

312
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,840
Don't jinx me.

313
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,980
I predict.

314
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,430
What song is this?

315
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,240
I think I want the Whammy Water.

316
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,680
Please marry Mint.

317
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,340
Oh,

318
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,540
identity.

319
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,180
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

320
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,220
Thank you.

321
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,900
Okay, I want the Whammy Water.

322
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,220
Gosh, I haven't...

323
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,640
That would make sense since this is an ID stage.

324
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,620
I haven't listened to that song in a long while, though.

325
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,220
Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.

326
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,120
Alright, so far.

327
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,520
So, do you do take out and not cook?

328
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,040
No, not fraud!

329
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,400
No, like I said, it's a maid cafe maid.

330
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,120
What do you mean by this?

331
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,940
Not a fraud.

332
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,940
I'm not a fraud.

333
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,780
I'm legitimate.

334
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,440
In my own sense, you know.

335
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,980
Fraud cafe?

336
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,440
No!

337
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,460
I'm gonna get the nurse's horn because I feel we might need it later.

338
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:17,060
One thing about Kiwawa in this game is I'm not so good with her...

339
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,560
With her...

340
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,700
Special, you know.

341
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,700
Typically, when someone should stick to what they know and stop talking about...

342
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,860
What they don't.

343
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,750
I see.

344
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,830
So they're just like, hey man, just put the fries in the bag.

345
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,030
Hey man, just...

346
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,710
You know.

347
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,990
Stick with the status quo.

348
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,410
Kiwawa in a nurse outfit.

349
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,030
All of Kiwawa's outfits are just...

350
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,350
All of Kiara's outfits are so good.

351
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,580
She keeps getting... She's like a fine wine.

352
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,420
She keeps getting sexier and sexier.

353
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,740
You know.

354
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,080
That's how I think about all my wine.

355
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,700
Oh, my wine's so sexy.

356
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,880
You know.

357
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,220
Okay, one thing I also want to try and do is get the... What is it?

358
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,900
The Kusogaki headband or whatever it's called.

359
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,740
I want that.

360
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,680
And we can increase our attack.

361
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,340
12 hour VOD.

362
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,000
Wait, what do you mean by that?

363
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,200
Oh, sorry.

364
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,500
12 hour VOD length restored.

365
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,520
Yes, I saw that.

366
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,580
I gotta delete the other one then.

367
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,720
Shackle's build is really funny.

368
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:07,820
I thought you meant 12 hour VOD me trying to get through stage 4.

369
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,020
I was like, wait a second.

370
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,440
What do you mean by that?

371
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,160
Yeah, I did see that.

372
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,300
Maybe it just took extra time to process.

373
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,620
I have no idea, man.

374
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,140
So crazy.

375
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,320
YouTube confuses me.

376
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,140
Because it was there and then it was gone and then they were like...

377
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,030
They had to stitch it back together.

378
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,010
It was there.

379
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,270
We know it was there.

380
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,810
Ooh, some wood.

381
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,340
If you were doing stage 4 hard, maybe.

382
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,380
Is it really that difficult?

383
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,820
Guys, did you see that Greed was nerfed?

384
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,880
I did a run with Greed and...

385
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,980
I had super chatotime and Greed earlier...

386
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,520
And I only made like 30,000 coins.

387
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,980
I was so depressed.

388
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,140
I was so depressed.

389
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,600
I was like, what do you mean?

390
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,320
What do you mean?

391
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,460
Why?

392
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,460
I was so sad.

393
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,860
They nerfed it.

394
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,960
I was getting 100k without trying before.

395
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,620
I know!

396
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,860
And then I saw some people that were just like...

397
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,680
Oh yeah, I used to get 50 million coins each run.

398
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,640
Super easy.

399
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,660
And I'm like, you know what?

400
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,380
That's probably like 1% of players.

401
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,640
That's like 1% of players.

402
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,540
See, this one would be so good.

403
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,540
If we had the Kusogaki.

404
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,360
I'm gonna do it.

405
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,100
I think haste...

406
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,040
I love haste.

407
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,240
I think haste applies to everything.

408
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,080
Because...

409
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,220
Because you can always hit harder if you hit faster.

410
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,360
I used to get a trillion zillion coins each run.

411
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,580
You are the 1%!

412
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,560
Don't be hasty.

413
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,020
Except in this game.

414
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,300
Oh, maybe I should have upgraded there.

415
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,640
Oopsie.

416
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,200
Oh wait, you're not a healer, are you?

417
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,460
What are you doing?

418
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,300
I got otaku!

419
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,540
Increase any healing.

420
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,380
Let's go.

421
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,580
Plan letter.

422
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,760
Guys, if you see the Kusogaki, scream.

423
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:55,680
Okay?

424
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,720
Let's go with this.

425
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,480
Lucky.

426
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,100
He applies to anybody, I guess.

427
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,220
What did I just grab?

428
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,120
Oh, I grabbed some corn.

429
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,960
Oh my god, this guy is over here healing at the same time.

430
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,060
Yo, chill out man.

431
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,240
Stupid.

432
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
I see a bottom right.

433
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,100
Incorrect!

434
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,100
Nope.

435
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,300
We'll do more haste.

436
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,540
Oh my god, you guys.

437
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,280
I had a crazy run earlier.

438
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,060
I had a crazy run earlier.

439
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,640
Where I got two special boxes.

440
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,560
And then, in my lineup, I had the Gorilla's Paw.

441
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,560
And then I had the Super Shadow Time.

442
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,780
And then I got two special boxes.

443
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,280
And one...

444
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,580
They were already in my inventory.

445
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,380
And then I got the special version of the Gorilla's Paw.

446
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,340
And then I got the special version of the Super Shadow Time.

447
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,740
I was like, how is this possible?

448
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,840
I didn't know that if something was in...

449
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,680
If you already had something...

450
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,300
You could get more...

451
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,080
You could get the upgraded version.

452
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,120
Then everyone clapped.

453
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,580
It's a real story!

454
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,360
Why would I make that up?

455
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,260
I clapped in my brain.

456
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,860
And my cats probably clapped for me.

457
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,880
They probably were like, wow, Mito!

458
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,480
You're so good at this game!

459
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,860
Oh, I need to keep running.

460
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,020
Oh my god, money!

461
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,240
Money, Yagoo!

462
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,370
Guys, remember...

463
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,270
Wait, remember...

464
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,690
Wait, remind...

465
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,010
Remember to remind me...

466
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,230
When I get an anvil to upgrade...

467
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,570
Lamy water, okay?

468
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,790
Remember...

469
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,030
Kirito, thanks for a whole month.

470
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,290
I'm gonna get some nightly milk.

471
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,620
I like the milk.

472
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,740
Oh, the milk.

473
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,420
Oh, just a tall glass of milk.

474
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,760
Oh, so yummy, so fresh.

475
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,500
What do I need to remind you again?

476
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,220
Uh...

477
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,740
It's fine, I got it.

478
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,720
Don't worry your pretty little head about it, okay?

479
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,820
Don't worry your pretty little head about it, okay?

480
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,340
So far, so good, guys.

481
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,160
So far, so good.

482
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
Good collabs.

483
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,580
I'm waiting for the book.

484
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,940
But also, what should...

485
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,260
Well, we did...

486
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,480
I didn't do endless for this, so...

487
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,820
We'll get collabs, don't worry.

488
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,860
Actually, I'm a loner.

489
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,720
I'm a lone wolf.

490
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,400
I don't do collabs.

491
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,220
I don't need anybody in my afterlife.

492
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,560
I'm a lone wolf, you know.

493
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,020
What did I just...

494
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,440
What was that?

495
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,320
So far, so much win.

496
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,060
Wow!

497
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,440
Thank you for the pink!

498
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,140
Okay, shadow.

499
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,840
I'll do this.

500
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,880
I'll do this.

501
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:51,980
Please...

502
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,200
I don't know what I want it to...

503
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,060
What?

504
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,120
See?

505
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,580
This is what happened before!

506
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,380
You guys, this is what happened.

507
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,580
I already had the nightly milk and then I get the better nightly milk.

508
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:03,920
What?

509
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,040
Oh my god, more haste!

510
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,900
I'm invincible.

511
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,640
Wait, don't say that.

512
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,220
I'm jinxing myself.

513
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,180
Everybody clap now!

514
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,820
Upgrade, upgrade.

515
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,400
Enchant.

516
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:24,940
Nice.

517
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,520
Everybody clap!

518
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,160
Everybody clap!

519
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:37,900
Max.

520
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,020
I guess it doesn't mean much anymore, I suppose.

521
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:51,120
All these buns look like candy cane candies to me.

522
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,500
A little peppermint.

523
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,620
I'm like a regular mint, but she's definitely a peppermint.

524
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,520
Hey, get out of here!

525
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,720
Oh my god, I was stuck on the pole!

526
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,920
I'm just going to keep going with what we got.

527
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,220
She's a bit spicy.

528
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,800
Mints aren't spicy.

529
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,540
What are you talking about spicy?

530
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,340
Don't forget dash.

531
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:31,720
True!

532
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,240
Thank you for the reminder.

533
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,060
Dash if stuck.

534
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,500
But I was stuck here.

535
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,140
So I couldn't... It was all me.

536
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,400
It was all me!

537
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,260
What's going to happen now?

538
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,580
Come on guys.

539
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
Mints are icy.

540
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,060
Icy.

541
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,800
When am I going to get the BL book?

542
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,000
Okay, what's the other...

543
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,640
Wait, what's the...

544
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,540
What's the super collab you can do with the whammy water?

545
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
What is that?

546
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,260
Would peppermint be a redhead with freckles?

547
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,740
Wendy's.

548
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,600
I don't know, maybe.

549
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,900
Glowstick.

550
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,160
Glowstick.

551
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:23,980
Glowstick.

552
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:29,140
Alright, maybe we'll do that instead since...

553
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,980
Haste up!

554
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,240
Oh my god.

555
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,960
Let's get haste 100.

556
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,200
Limiter?

557
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,160
No, it's okay.

558
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,280
We got the nightly milk.

559
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,640
So we need the sake and we need the...

560
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,100
Look at my haste!

561
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,160
Oh my gosh, I got a diamond.

562
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,080
No ice?

563
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,840
Glowstick, I got it.

564
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:10,140
See, I would like to get this, the membership, but I'm afraid if I never get the...

565
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,240
I guess we have a lot of coins, right?

566
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,160
Yeah, I'm gonna hold it.

567
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,800
Okay, let's get it.

568
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,500
Easy.

569
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,500
Take it for now.

570
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,400
We'll get it.

571
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,040
We'll get the Kusogaki.

572
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,660
How is my...Oh, let's enchant this.

573
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,500
Since we're going for...

574
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
For survival...

575
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,560
Survival is most important.

576
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,580
What is he doing?

577
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,300
What's the blue?

578
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,280
Haste up!

579
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,920
Oh my god.

580
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,600
No way!

581
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,160
Oh...

582
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,010
More haste!

583
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,750
It might become my downfall, but I don't really care right now.

584
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,010
We are speed.

585
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,110
Keep one slot free.

586
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,310
Oh yeah, I have two slots left.

587
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,310
We'll need one for the sake.

588
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,470
Okay, we need one for Kusogaki and one for sake.

589
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:28,550
Okay.

590
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,170
Luckily we have greed...

591
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,370
For...

592
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,290
To help against the membership.

593
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,030
Kusogaki.

594
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,650
Yeah, Kiara is really good, I'll be honest.

595
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,270
Oh gosh.

596
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,070
Oh my god.

597
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,050
Oh my god.

598
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,550
Sorry, I'm stupid.

599
00:34:58,810 --> 00:34:59,870
Oh gosh, it's a whole time.

600
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,510
Okay, I gotta lock in.

601
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,010
I gotta lock in.

602
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,240
You know what?

603
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:12,800
Super!

604
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,940
I made it six.

605
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:34,730
What did we grab?

606
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,110
I'm gonna run over here for a second.

607
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,750
Okay.

608
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,950
Nice.

609
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,050
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

610
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,790
I'm trying to get rid of some of these guys.

611
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,920
Taking care...

612
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,460
No, no.

613
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,280
If only earlier.

614
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,770
It hurts.

615
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:22,310
No.

616
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,030
You guys know I need space for your sake.

617
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:32,590
I guess I can get the sake and then it will use up that spot.

618
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,930
And then maybe we can get the kusogaki, right?

619
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,290
Drop it for the achievement?

620
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,530
I already have the achievement.

621
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,180
If I have it, I wouldn't need the shackles.

622
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,180
What do you mean I don't need the shackles?

623
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,180
We still have... This is hurting our attack a little bit.

624
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,610
Oh wait, for every ten times holo coins are picked, permanently gain one... Okay, nevermind.

625
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:05,890
Take!

626
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,610
Nevermind!

627
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,270
You're right, we don't need it!

628
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,300
Okay.

629
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,820
Attack by 50%.

630
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,200
Nice.

631
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,640
Strength, baby!

632
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,260
Strength and haste!

633
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,440
Oh yeah!

634
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,620
We are eating good.

635
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,600
Because we are doing the cooking.

636
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,420
We are doing the feasting.

637
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,740
I keep getting stuck on this damn statue.

638
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,680
Where is my dirt?

639
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,740
Guys, I have a confession.

640
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,880
So because...

641
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,440
So I was...

642
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,520
I just got 4K monitors today, right?

643
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,700
And I play this game...

644
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,600
I play this game not on full screen so that I can read chat and everything.

645
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,100
But...

646
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,420
It would be really small.

647
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,000
I didn't know how to change the resolution because the button never worked.

648
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,160
And then I got this computer and it was so tiny.

649
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,280
Like I... Before when I would play on stream, it would be so so small.

650
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,280
But then it was even smaller this time.

651
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,760
And I was like, oh my gosh, I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this.

652
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,560
So I almost had to play super duper tiny like.

653
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,200
But I figured it out.

654
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,420
I googled it.

655
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,620
How to make it so that it's not so small, you know?

656
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,140
I figured it out.

657
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,020
So I spared you guys.

658
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,720
Well, you guys would never have noticed.

659
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,020
But I would have for sure.

660
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:54,180
I would have been squinting the entire time trying to read everything.

661
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,880
No, the new monitors aren't OLEDs, unfortunately.

662
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,500
There was... So I went...

663
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,220
At Tokyo Game Show, they had a display for Pixio monitors.

664
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,460
And they were so cute.

665
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,840
They had the whole setup.

666
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:17,500
They have monitors in blue, purple, green or mint.

667
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,120
It was a little more greener than the mint that I would have liked.

668
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,460
But it was so...

669
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,300
It was so... They were so cute.

670
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,120
And I got mine in pink.

671
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,340
I got mine in pink.

672
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,400
Wait.

673
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,320
Where are we at?

674
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,280
Oh wait, I can see it.

675
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,200
Okay, 7.

676
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,840
I'm gonna hold off on this.

677
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,800
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

678
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:50,860
Yeah!

679
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,500
And I'm really happy because...

680
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,740
Before, I was...

681
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,360
Let's go, you know what?

682
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:58,920
Be a book now.

683
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,760
I was having to deal with...

684
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,100
Well, my monitors, one of them was different than the other, so...

685
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,560
Drop.

686
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,460
Take.

687
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,780
No, I'll take it.

688
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,040
So, like, it would...

689
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,060
It was so annoying because one of them, the color was completely off.

690
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,420
I even looked up the monitor and there was like a Reddit thread that was like...

691
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,060
Do not buy this monitor.

692
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,320
The colors on it are terrible.

693
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,340
I wish I had seen that before I got in it.

694
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:32,980
Okay.

695
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,090
Yeah, we should start eliminating stuff, huh?

696
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,430
Oh, there's another one.

697
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:43,610
Wow.

698
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,860
No, I couldn't adjust the colors on it.

699
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,020
It was just not great.

700
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,640
But it's okay.

701
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,220
I tried calibrating it manually.

702
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,120
But it's okay.

703
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,340
Now they're two of the same monitor, so...

704
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,700
They are...

705
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,720
We're fit to go.

706
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,860
We're good to go.

707
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,460
G to G.

708
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,400
What should I...

709
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,080
Oh, let's go with Psycho Axe because then we can do that collab.

710
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,460
But I'm still getting used to it because the resolution is all different.

711
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,100
Yeah, we're hot to go.

712
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,040
H-O-T-T-O-G.

713
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,500
Hey, chill out, chill out.

714
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,300
Nah, I'm still getting used to it.

715
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,240
I listened to you and Nerissa sing that a lot.

716
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,540
Thanks for listening to it.

717
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,260
Wow!

718
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,900
Guys, I think this might be the furthest I've gotten ever.

719
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:58,130
If I beat this first try, which I don't think I will, but...

720
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:58,550
Oh my god.

721
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,770
Okay, that was so...

722
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,070
No, I'm not gonna get the HALU.

723
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,070
In fact, goodbye!

724
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,110
So you guys can all shut up about it.

725
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,530
I'm gonna get rid of the ninja headband.

726
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:19,870
Disintegrated.

727
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:21,530
Yes.

728
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:27,990
Yeah, if I beat this first try, do I just end the stream?

729
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,790
There's another stage after this though, right?

730
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,290
Isn't it the casino or...

731
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:34,930
Am I crazy?

732
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,820
Do a stage 5.

733
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:41,560
Okay.

734
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,800
Stage 5.

735
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,580
Who's doing these?

736
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,120
Yo, yo, chill out, chill out.

737
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:53,520
Who's this?

738
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,940
Hey, all of you!

739
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,100
Where's my mouse?

740
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,340
Oh, there it is.

741
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,640
Chill out!

742
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,240
Oh my god.

743
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:12,900
Oh my god.

744
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:13,900
Oh my god.

745
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,920
Are we ever gonna get the sake?

746
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:20,800
Ever?

747
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,880
Hopefully one day.

748
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,340
Okay, we're safe.

749
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,500
Safety.

750
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,490
I'm taking damage.

751
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,650
I'm taking damage.

752
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,490
I'm not grazing enough.

753
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,650
Reroll.

754
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,450
I think we'll try... We'll see next one.

755
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:02,070
I still have other weapons that I can enhance, but I would like to get the super.

756
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,460
Have you done the hard versions of the stages yet?

757
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,500
I've done the hard version of only stage 1.

758
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
So, not a ton.

759
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,700
She's that girl.

760
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,820
I'm that girl!

761
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:26,140
I saw people being like... I posted that on YouTube yesterday.

762
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,380
I was just like, she's that girl.

763
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,780
I didn't really mean anything by it, but I saw some people being like, I don't understand what this means.

764
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,960
Honestly, me neither.

765
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,260
I just feel like that girl.

766
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,180
It's really whatever you feel like with it, you know?

767
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,540
I'm that girl.

768
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,860
See, I want this!

769
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,780
I want the attack multiplied!

770
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,860
We have a good setup going on, but...

771
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,020
It could be better.

772
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,740
I'm a little...

773
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,660
I want the gorilla's paw.

774
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,520
Ban the paw.

775
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,960
No, I won't have... I won't be able to get it, I think.

776
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,040
It's OK.

777
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,600
Let's just keep going with...

778
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:13,920
OK, you know what?

779
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,460
I'm going to re-roll.

780
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:15,960
Actually...

781
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,600
Yeah, I'm going to re-roll, because I want to...

782
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,140
One more!

783
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:21,980
One more!

784
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:24,940
OK, I give up.

785
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,080
You're definitely one of the most girls of all time.

786
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:29,520
No!

787
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,640
Drop the limiter.

788
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,460
Sorry, everybody.

789
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,700
We're extremely exclusive club now.

790
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,440
We're very picky.

791
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,980
We're extremely picky.

792
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,640
We're very exclusive.

793
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,800
Please, please understand.

794
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,440
I love getting the limiter.

795
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,440
Don't get me wrong.

796
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,640
But we have the nightly milk, which also increases your...

797
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,480
Which also increases your... What's it called?

798
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,940
Your pickup range.

799
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,640
So it's all good.

800
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,640
And this isn't a very big map, so...

801
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,460
Honestly, it's really easy to get stuff.

802
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,840
OK, let's eliminate...

803
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,220
Hope.

804
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,400
Goodbye, hope.

805
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,180
All hope is lost.

806
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,720
Sorry, everybody.

807
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,520
No hope.

808
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:18,860
Oh, money!

809
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,740
What is this?

810
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,440
Oh my gosh, I completely forgot about stamps.

811
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,460
If the target is defeated within 2 seconds after being hit by this weapon, you have 1% chance to drop a stamp.

812
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,100
Nah, I'm going to go on haste.

813
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,620
Who would Otacon's Hololive Oshi be?

814
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,580
Otacon's Hololive Oshi.

815
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:49,430
Oh my gosh.

816
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,690
Oh my gosh, I just noticed this.

817
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:52,970
I think

818
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,380
Pekora is a little too...

819
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,160
I think he would want someone really soft.

820
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,860
Like, you know, kind of soft-spoken even.

821
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,290
Maybe Korone.

822
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,390
Maybe Korone, because she...

823
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:17,450
Plays a bunch of retro games.

824
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:20,750
Or Ina?

825
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,370
Yeah, someone like Ina, right?

826
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:22,930
I don't know.

827
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:25,910
Or Fauna.

828
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:26,250
Oh!

829
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,410
Everybody loves Fauna.

830
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,630
Yeah, I could definitely see him loving Fauna.

831
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,730
Couldn't you just see him, like...

832
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:35,390
With a super, like, you know...

833
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,170
But actually, you know what?

834
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:38,550
Maybe he doesn't want a soft girl.

835
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,130
He fell in love with Sniper Wolf.

836
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:53,560
Botan?

837
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:56,340
Because...

838
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,820
She's like...

839
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,340
Well, she is FPS, but...

840
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,540
Kind of, like, tactical.

841
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,890
Oh my gosh, it's getting a little...

842
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:11,170
Ah!

843
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:12,150
Dasaki!

844
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:15,690
We did it!

845
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,190
Oh my gosh.

846
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,750
Am I even gonna get the super collab, though?

847
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:23,370
So we're already at 18 and a half minutes.

848
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:27,170
Guys, I don't even know if this might have been a waste of time.

849
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:31,650
Oh my gosh.

850
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,830
There's also even this one.

851
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,970
This Psycho Axe to give me...

852
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:40,650
Oh, nice, nice.

853
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:44,830
Cutting board?

854
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:47,710
No.

855
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:54,770
Sure.

856
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:57,670
Board plus curse?

857
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:58,790
Is that a...

858
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,730
It binds with curse?

859
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:01,130
It does?

860
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,110
Oh, ok, nevermind.

861
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:02,830
Good, good.

862
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,480
Not that I think we'll be able to...

863
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,440
But...

864
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,080
That's ok.

865
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,340
We're grazing, we're grazing.

866
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,600
Toho here.

867
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:24,010
What if I never knew what...

868
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:24,710
Oh, come on.

869
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:24,970
Seriously?

870
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:25,510
Reroll?

871
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,210
What the hell?

872
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:28,730
Wait, is sake maxed?

873
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,490
Oh no, we're not level 50 yet.

874
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,230
Risk of rain?

875
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:36,410
No, this is Galaga.

876
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:41,430
Sake is maxed.

877
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:41,790
Oh, ok.

878
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,610
You think love can bloom in a super chat?

879
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:48,990
I do.

880
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:53,350
Someone could see your super chat.

881
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:55,550
Someone in chat would be like, that person is so dedicated.

882
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:59,030
Wish I had someone like that in my life.

883
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,250
You know?

884
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:03,510
What is happening?

885
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:04,530
What's the pink?

886
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:05,890
What's going on?

887
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,430
You, I see you.

888
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:11,470
What are you doing to them?

889
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,590
You're making them emit pheromones.

890
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,390
Oh my god, they're too sexy.

891
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,560
Too real.

892
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,440
Oh, knowing Otacon's luck with girls, his oshi would graduate a month after he...

893
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,580
You know, it's funny because I thought aqua earlier.

894
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,720
I was like, aqua would be really good.

895
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,520
I'm gonna use my special because I'm scared right now.

896
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,820
I'm scared!

897
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,700
They're emitting more pheromones!

898
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,760
Wait, is that me emitting the pheromones?

899
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,880
Wait, who's emitting pheromones?

900
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:55,400
Is it me?

901
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,780
Oh my god!

902
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,560
Guys, we finally got the hammer.

903
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,100
But...

904
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,680
Oh my god.

905
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,720
Oh there it is!

906
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,660
Oh god!

907
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:12,840
Wait!

908
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:13,680
Wait!

909
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:14,300
Hold on.

910
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,460
Hold!

911
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,120
Hold!

912
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:16,580
Hold!

913
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:20,720
There we go.

914
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:21,820
I was like, wait a second.

915
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:23,780
Hold!

916
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,220
Oh my gosh.

917
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,940
There is so much going on here.

918
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,120
Look at all of them.

919
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:39,640
So cute.

920
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,340
We're gaming?

921
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,120
We're gaming!

922
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:43,620
We're gaming!

923
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,060
We're gaming!

924
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:44,500
We're gaming!

925
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,500
We're gaming!

926
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:46,900
We're gaming!

927
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:47,360
We're gaming!

928
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,120
We're gaming!

929
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,660
We're gaming!

930
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,060
Oh my god.

931
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,640
Oh my god.

932
00:51:59,100 --> 00:51:59,720
Oh my god!

933
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,080
Guys...

934
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,460
What else can we get?

935
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:11,900
I'll just do the cutting board.

936
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,340
What if I did the Asakoko?

937
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,160
See, I like to get the...

938
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:48,970
Sausage!

939
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,530
Thanks for the stream!

940
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,560
Oh Fantasy Island.

941
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,760
Bubble Knife!

942
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:17,320
Ok, let's do 5.

943
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,300
Let's do stage 5.

944
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,740
I don't even need the dash.

945
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,140
Wow, it's so cute.

946
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,680
Oh, they're coming from the ocean!

947
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,840
They're coming from the sea.

948
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:29,580
Oh god.

949
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,540
It's kind of scary.

950
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,380
What is this?

951
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,080
Oh, critical hit.

952
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:34,860
Let's just take it.

953
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,900
You meant hard mode 4.

954
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,600
I don't even have it unlocked.

955
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,280
Osubito.

956
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:42,760
No!

957
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,780
Let's do stage 5.

958
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,380
I believe in Kiwawa!

959
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,980
Oh my god, a whole shark.

960
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:57,700
Ok.

961
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,020
Locked in, yeah.

962
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:05,060
This is our first time playing stage 5, guys.

963
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,400
This is my first time even seeing it.

964
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:07,540
Ah!

965
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:14,360
We have so much more stream time now to apply Holo Oshis to MGS characters.

966
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,700
I've decided that based on nothing, Blade Wolfs is Kali.

967
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,560
Ok, that's fine.

968
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,340
I don't disagree.

969
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,120
Oh, there's like Indiana Jones going on here.

970
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,420
I don't disagree.

971
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,020
I don't know if I agree-agree.

972
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,320
Should we go for the same setup as before?

973
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,260
Let's try...

974
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,320
We can do another haste...

975
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,280
And try for the Kusogaki.

976
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,900
But last time, we were like so set.

977
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,780
We were so good.

978
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,480
It's a good thing she's a phoenix.

979
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,860
BL Super Club.

980
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,040
What's that one?

981
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,360
What's the BL Super Club?

982
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,180
I can't remember.

983
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,020
Gorilla Fire Breath?

984
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,920
I don't like that one very much because it's so targeted.

985
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,240
Yeah, I didn't get the question last time.

986
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,940
BL plus Hope Soda.

987
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,760
Oh, what?

988
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,020
I didn't know that was one.

989
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,540
I think Fatman's Oshi would be Takanashi Kiara.

990
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,580
I will not be answering any questions.

991
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,320
Are you basing that assumption on...

992
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,980
Because she owns a fast food restaurant and his name is Fatman.

993
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,200
I'm just...

994
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,540
Oh my god.

995
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,060
Ouchie, ouch, ouch, ouch.

996
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,320
Let's...

997
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,390
Let's go for it.

998
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:44,630
Let's go for it.

999
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:45,670
Hope Soda!

1000
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,610
BL Super Club!

1001
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:50,950
Oh my god.

1002
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:56,090
Can we not keep doing this?

1003
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,070
Don't forget the axe.

1004
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,710
Yeah, we gotta grab it.

1005
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,470
What if I just did the Asakoko?

1006
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:11,170
I wanna get... I should've held it.

1007
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,470
But the hold only works...

1008
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,470
For like, until...

1009
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,210
Like, it only works one thing.

1010
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,650
You have to grab it the next time.

1011
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,210
You know, it's kind of sad.

1012
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,270
The ships fire when you walk past them.

1013
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,090
Yeah, I've noticed.

1014
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:28,130
I didn't even notice there were ships over there.

1015
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:29,830
That's fun.

1016
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:30,930
What's this?

1017
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:32,070
What's it gonna give me?

1018
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:34,490
Food.

1019
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,090
Oh my god.

1020
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:38,870
Oh my god.

1021
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,090
He's too cool.

1022
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:41,650
Oh my god, he's too chill.

1023
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,050
Where did that chill dog come from?

1024
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,590
I want it.

1025
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,120
Haste.

1026
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,280
Haste.

1027
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:04,820
Haste.

1028
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:05,880
Haste.

1029
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:12,550
Fine.

1030
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:16,270
Nice.

1031
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,040
How does this keep happening?

1032
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:32,740
You guys, this is actually like the fourth time in a row this has happened to me!

1033
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,120
I'm telling you!

1034
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,440
I'm telling you, this is the fourth time in a row this has happened to me!

1035
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,820
It has to be when they updated the game.

1036
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,340
No, I don't know what I see.

1037
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,420
Oh, nice BL book.

1038
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,740
I wasn't even streaming when it happened before.

1039
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,780
I think it's the patch.

1040
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,920
I think it's the new update, you know?

1041
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:10,960
Haste.

1042
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,320
That might have been stupid, but I don't care.

1043
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,460
I don't care.

1044
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,340
The Minto luck.

1045
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,220
I don't have any of that.

1046
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:25,240
I don't have any luck, you guys.

1047
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,540
Kill the pie.

1048
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,000
My first time seeing the sausage!

1049
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,660
Should I grab it?

1050
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,640
What's it good with?

1051
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,140
Should enable drop hacks again?

1052
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,220
Collabs with BL?

1053
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,140
But we are not doing BL, we are doing BL acts.

1054
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,280
We are doing BL acts, remember?

1055
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,780
Because we are doing the Hope Super Collab.

1056
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:57,800
I've never seen it before.

1057
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,320
I'll grab it still though.

1058
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,860
I just want to see it.

1059
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:05,920
Where is the sausage?

1060
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,200
Sausage.

1061
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:12,600
Sausage.

1062
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,240
Nice.

1063
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:16,340
Sausage.

1064
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:16,420
Sausage.

1065
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:22,730
Too many trees.

1066
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,750
Too many trees.

1067
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:27,810
Axe!

1068
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,690
There we go, baby!

1069
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:33,010
Too many... Actually, this is...

1070
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:33,650
Oh my God!

1071
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:34,310
Look at them go!

1072
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,230
Crab Rave!

1073
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:41,710
That's so cute.

1074
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:45,890
Nice.

1075
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:52,110
Who's coming down there?

1076
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,810
You, you, you!

1077
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,470
I'll take you out.

1078
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,110
You can't kill yourself.

1079
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:00,350
I'm too fast for you.

1080
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:02,910
Crab Rave.

1081
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:07,690
Oh my gosh, we still have dance... We still have our own skills to level up.

1082
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:11,490
Let's do dancer.

1083
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:13,790
Tiny dancer.

1084
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:16,110
How tall is Kiara?

1085
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:19,130
How tall is Kiara?

1086
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:20,190
Make KFP in the chat.

1087
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:21,650
How tall is Kiara?

1088
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:29,470
I think we're close to Gachikoi.

1089
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,010
I'm not doing anything.

1090
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:57,250
That's not me.

1091
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:09,490
This was happening to me earlier, you guys.

1092
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:11,410
5-5, thank you.

1093
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:14,150
5-5.

1094
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:20,110
5 plus 5 equals 10.

1095
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,130
And she's a 10 in my books.

1096
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:30,530
Alright, now we just gotta get the axe in the BL book to max.

1097
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:33,830
I wanna enchant them as well, but, you know...

1098
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:38,670
Kiara is a 10 out of 10.

1099
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,790
Also, I was playing the first level...

1100
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:45,710
The first stage of this.

1101
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:49,850
Did they add the little gyruses in to the first stage?

1102
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,550
I don't remember them being there before.

1103
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:58,500
Yeah, they did.

1104
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:03,890
Oh my god.

1105
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:06,130
Scared me.

1106
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:07,070
Oh my goodness.

1107
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:14,030
One great thing about Kiara in the game is when she runs around, she regains her health.

1108
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,350
And also gains attack.

1109
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:18,290
So that's why you...

1110
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:20,110
A, B, M.

1111
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:22,530
Always be moving.

1112
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:24,650
Actually, A, B, S.

1113
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:25,490
Abs.

1114
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:27,350
Always be schmovin'.

1115
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:32,690
Did you unlock Nerissa or Elizabeth?

1116
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,010
They're not in the game.

1117
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:39,110
They're not in the game.

1118
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:42,730
Not yet.

1119
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,600
Oh wow, we have all of these.

1120
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,280
That's kind of crazy.

1121
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,260
Let's go.

1122
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,280
We'll just do the axe and the book at the same time.

1123
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:57,200
Usually I like to focus on one, but...

1124
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,760
We can level them up equally.

1125
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:01,620
Stuck on a tree.

1126
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,040
See?

1127
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:03,720
Too many trees.

1128
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:08,820
Too many trees.

1129
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:09,020
Trees.

1130
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,740
Can't even tell who I'm fighting there.

1131
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:15,480
Oh my god.

1132
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:21,980
Okay.

1133
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,040
Let's grab our shield.

1134
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,220
I think that's Max now, maybe.

1135
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,660
Just a chill guy.

1136
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,160
I didn't even see who that was.

1137
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,700
Whose mascot was that?

1138
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,180
There's a Nerissa item now though.

1139
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,240
Oh, I think I saw that before.

1140
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,760
I've seen like the bibu stamp.

1141
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:07,170
I've never had so many super items.

1142
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,590
Kay, if you're watching this, I think the game is...

1143
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:12,990
I think the game needs another patch.

1144
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:18,970
I think something's broken.

1145
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,610
I think something's broken.

1146
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:28,390
Did I get increased speed from that?

1147
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:31,210
Holy moly, I'm zoomin'.

1148
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:33,150
I'm zoomin' right now.

1149
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:35,070
I got an axolotl!

1150
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:35,910
Oh my god.

1151
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:37,210
Wait, I've never...

1152
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:39,790
I haven't even fished an axolotl before.

1153
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:41,050
Are you kidding me?

1154
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:41,930
What?

1155
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:43,590
They dropped an axolotl.

1156
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,630
I haven't even caught an axolotl before.

1157
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,430
No!

1158
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:49,510
Are you kidding me right now?

1159
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:53,990
Oh my god, did someone raid me?

1160
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:54,710
Thank you.

1161
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:56,810
I didn't see who raided me, but thank you for the raid.

1162
01:04:58,310 --> 01:04:59,310
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

1163
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:01,150
We're currently going through this crazy...

1164
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,650
Look at how many super items I have!

1165
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:05,090
What's going on?

1166
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:07,430
This game is nutso.

1167
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:09,290
I'm not hacking.

1168
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:11,970
Or am I?

1169
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:16,210
This is your luck bonus for having Mato soon.

1170
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:19,150
Oh, I get all the luck now so that I...

1171
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:23,470
So actually, I had to call...

1172
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:25,330
Oh, thank you for the gifted, you guys!

1173
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:27,730
I had to call my maintenance.

1174
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:31,730
Because actually, the shower...

1175
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:36,210
Was only putting out scalding hot water.

1176
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:37,990
And so...

1177
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:40,170
I called them to fix it.

1178
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:41,890
Which...

1179
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:42,490
You know.

1180
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,230
But, I know she's a roach.

1181
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:47,170
She would be able to...

1182
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:48,810
Survive it, so...

1183
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:50,830
Even if I have kept it, it's like whatever.

1184
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:52,670
But...

1185
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:54,670
Now, it's opposite.

1186
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:57,590
So, even though it said on the hot side...

1187
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:58,730
It says cold.

1188
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:02,670
Even though it says hot, it's actually cold water.

1189
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:05,230
And even if it's cold, it's actually hot water.

1190
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,470
Like, what if I just don't tell her that?

1191
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:13,990
What if I...

1192
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:14,850
Hi, Smee!

1193
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:15,670
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

1194
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:18,510
What if I just, like, let her...

1195
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,590
What if I just let her be a little surprised?

1196
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:25,410
Action.

1197
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,820
Oh, tree!

1198
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,800
I wish I could cut the trees down.

1199
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,040
I wish to become the one slur.

1200
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:39,100
Oh my gosh, it hasn't even been 10 minutes yet.

1201
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,740
I'm stressed out a little bit in this stage.

1202
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,040
Oh!

1203
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:42,940
Is this our first?

1204
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,000
Oh, our second stamp.

1205
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,060
I'll take it.

1206
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,280
Increase the size.

1207
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,100
Shikami-oh!

1208
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:49,100
Welcome to the membership.

1209
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,300
Do a BA gacha pull before your luck runs out.

1210
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,040
Guys, I've been so busy.

1211
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,180
I haven't even played Blue Archive in a minute.

1212
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,040
There's been so much prep for the...

1213
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,040
for the concert that it's just been...

1214
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,120
my focus for everything currently.

1215
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,100
Okay, what was I still trying to get?

1216
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,120
The kuso gaki, right?

1217
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,540
Maybe I don't need the kuso gaki.

1218
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:25,760
Have you looked at the Heaven Burns Red yet?

1219
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,700
No, but I want to.

1220
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:29,220
Because...

1221
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,460
Konomi is the singing voice for one of the characters.

1222
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,360
You're missing out on Made Yuzu.

1223
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,300
I already have Made Yuzu from the last time she showed up.

1224
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,780
Just making sure.

1225
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,900
These guys have guns!

1226
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:58,760
I was wondering who was...

1227
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:04,450
I was wondering who was shooting at me.

1228
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,000
Knockback.

1229
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:12,720
No, let's just keep going with the cycle.

1230
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:16,080
But I haven't gotten any anvils to enchant these.

1231
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,220
It's kind of frustrating.

1232
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,300
I like how they come from the sea.

1233
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,360
It's literally like...

1234
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,280
She came from the ocean.

1235
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,000
They're all...

1236
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,480
just their own sort of kaiju.

1237
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,020
Good, good.

1238
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:34,400
Alright.

1239
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,620
Coming up on 10 minutes.

1240
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,460
First boss.

1241
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:39,300
Soon-ish.

1242
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,980
I would like to have a super collab...

1243
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:43,680
before then.

1244
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,360
Can I super collab with them?

1245
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,260
I guess I can, huh?

1246
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,440
I guess I can.

1247
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:58,030
You can?

1248
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:58,290
Okay.

1249
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,740
That's why Godzilla is in this stage.

1250
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:07,720
Wait, what do you mean by that?

1251
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,380
He did what in the black...

1252
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,000
Stop.

1253
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,680
You might lose the benefits though.

1254
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:19,740
So then, should we collab the sausage...

1255
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,340
and the BL book...

1256
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,320
and do another super collab?

1257
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:28,060
Maybe we should do another super collab...

1258
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,640
so that we don't lose the super collab.

1259
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,080
Wait, you won't lose the benefits.

1260
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,920
Are we sure?

1261
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,500
Are we sure?

1262
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,540
There's so many people saying one or the other.

1263
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:49,430
You lose the guaranteed crit.

1264
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:50,630
Yeah, see?

1265
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:53,690
Wait, but then some people are saying you lose benefit...

1266
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:54,610
Wait, benefits.

1267
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:56,470
You won't lose.

1268
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:58,190
Someone mentioned Godzilla.

1269
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,850
I don't know.

1270
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:06,230
Even K does...

1271
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:08,030
Wait, K is here?

1272
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:09,730
Okay.

1273
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:13,610
I don't know.

1274
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:14,390
I'm scared.

1275
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:19,910
You only lose the crit part, but it's worth.

1276
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:20,410
Trust.

1277
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:23,430
Okay.

1278
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:25,510
I'm scared.

1279
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:30,410
Let's just apply it since we have a free slot.

1280
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:35,770
Rat.

1281
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:39,710
I'm gonna do it on size.

1282
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:45,070
I can cover so much ground now.

1283
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:51,890
Boss incoming!

1284
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:58,630
I wasn't gonna get the super collab anytime soon anyway.

1285
01:10:58,790 --> 01:10:59,850
I'm only level 30.

1286
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:01,730
Thanks for the five gifted.

1287
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:03,510
Oh, Birdbrain!

1288
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:04,670
Hello!

1289
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:18,970
Oh my gosh.

1290
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:19,850
Hello everybody!

1291
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:21,430
Thanks for the gifted.

1292
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:23,830
Wow!

1293
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:26,850
You guys were... I saw you guys were playing earlier.

1294
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:29,910
Thank you for the braid!

1295
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,070
Hello everybody!

1296
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:37,550
I'm about to do... This is my first time playing stage 5.

1297
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,890
I'm about to do the boss fight and I'm scared.

1298
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:41,730
I'm a little frightened.

1299
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:43,530
Oh, here we go.

1300
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:45,250
Oh, but I didn't get to enchant them.

1301
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:48,010
Thanks for the gifted!

1302
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:49,070
Thanks for the gifted!

1303
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,190
Oh my god, there's too many gifted.

1304
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:51,770
Thank you guys!

1305
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:52,610
Thank you!

1306
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:53,370
Thank you!

1307
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,070
I think I missed one.

1308
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:56,650
Thank you!

1309
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:57,350
Thank you!

1310
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:58,670
Thank you!

1311
01:11:58,710 --> 01:11:59,430
Sir Steak.

1312
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:01,750
For justice!

1313
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:03,210
Justice raid!

1314
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:03,330
Justice raid!

1315
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:09,290
Look at this, you guys.

1316
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:14,210
I'm having the ultimate streamer luck in this run.

1317
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:16,330
So I'm scared to lose at all.

1318
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:18,830
OK, I'm gonna save.

1319
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:20,270
Oh my god.

1320
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:23,670
Oh my god.

1321
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:27,590
Oh wait, I literally said Godzilla earlier.

1322
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,230
No way.

1323
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:30,730
No way!

1324
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:32,270
Oh my gosh.

1325
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:34,410
Oh god.

1326
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:37,250
Oh gosh.

1327
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:37,730
OK.

1328
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:39,630
Don't get trapped.

1329
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:45,110
Keep going.

1330
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:45,590
Keep going.

1331
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:46,210
Around.

1332
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:46,630
Circle.

1333
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:47,090
Circular.

1334
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:48,010
Circular.

1335
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:48,570
Circular.

1336
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:54,290
OK.

1337
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:00,550
Three super items?

1338
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:01,750
I know, I'm killing it.

1339
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,610
I'm killing it right now.

1340
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:07,810
Kiwawa is my strength!

1341
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,810
This is why you always play as your Oshi, everybody.

1342
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:13,210
Your Oshi will give you strength!

1343
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:16,470
OK, I don't think I'm ever... It's fine.

1344
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:21,770
I don't know if I'll ever get it.

1345
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:25,670
The anvil.

1346
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:28,730
We're circling!

1347
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:30,790
Yeah!

1348
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,940
My Oshi gets nerfed every patch.

1349
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:41,740
Wait, who's... Who?

1350
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,420
Gluz, welcome to Mumbo's shop.

1351
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:45,940
Thank you.

1352
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,980
One boss down.

1353
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:51,440
Sausage.

1354
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:00,270
What?

1355
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:03,470
What should I collab with the sausage then?

1356
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:04,590
Joshua, thanks for the gift.

1357
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,190
What should I gift with this sausage?

1358
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,520
The Asakoko tail.

1359
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:14,920
OK.

1360
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,500
I'll still grab this though.

1361
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,320
I'll still grab it, but I will wait for tail.

1362
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,920
I wish it were fluffy tail, but you know...

1363
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,080
Beggars cannot be choosers.

1364
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:30,880
What is this?

1365
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,660
Oh, Fen!

1366
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:33,640
Cute.

1367
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,240
Tears are one of the best single weapons.

1368
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:41,760
Is that true?

1369
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,740
Tears are strong.

1370
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:51,920
An idol's tears.

1371
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,760
What's that girl's band cry thing?

1372
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,160
The yogurt that makes you cry?

1373
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,300
I'm stuck on a tree.

1374
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,940
I want to become the Onceler.

1375
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:05,960
I want to cut down the trees.

1376
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,480
I'm stuck in the trees.

1377
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:11,440
No more trees.

1378
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,520
Queens don't cry.

1379
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:17,020
What is... Everything is happening.

1380
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:18,320
What is that from?

1381
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,840
There's so many memes that just have shown up.

1382
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,400
I mean, that's usually, I guess, how memes work.

1383
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,560
They just show up out of nowhere.

1384
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,480
I saw one earlier that was like...

1385
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,220
It was Dante and Virgil's mom.

1386
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,540
And then she's like, devils never cry.

1387
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:37,960
That one.

1388
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:40,800
That one got a good chuckle out of me.

1389
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,240
I really like that one.

1390
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:46,330
Fido.

1391
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:49,550
What do you guys think?

1392
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:52,510
Boom or... What's the other one?

1393
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,030
What do they say?

1394
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:54,270
Boom or...

1395
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:56,990
Doom.

1396
01:15:57,410 --> 01:15:59,310
Boom or Doom.

1397
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:01,270
Not for Kiowa.

1398
01:16:02,210 --> 01:16:04,250
Yeah, I think not for her skill.

1399
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:05,010
I agree.

1400
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:07,230
Doom.

1401
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:11,150
You're both my and one of my cats.

1402
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:11,750
Oh geez.

1403
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:13,990
When he had a baby.

1404
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:15,090
Wait, sorry.

1405
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:18,630
Sorry, hold on.

1406
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,510
Let me re-read that.

1407
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:25,250
When he was a baby.

1408
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,640
I play VTuber streams for him to get used to people voices and he perks up the most when he streams.

1409
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:37,880
Thank you, Trashboat.

1410
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,040
Sorry.

1411
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,200
Doom.

1412
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:50,800
Does this map have like boxes or anything?

1413
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,700
Like little drops that you go pick up somewhere?

1414
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,260
I haven't seen one yet.

1415
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,480
But I haven't traveled very far.

1416
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,460
I got ambushed.

1417
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:01,560
No?

1418
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:01,920
Okay.

1419
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,580
Then I will stay in my comfortable area.

1420
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,580
Wait, I'm not in my comfortable area.

1421
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:08,760
I'm at the trees.

1422
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,140
Wait, let's go down.

1423
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:14,500
Wait, less trees, less trees.

1424
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:15,780
Where's my cursor?

1425
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:17,960
There it is.

1426
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,120
Somebody gifted.

1427
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:24,940
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1428
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,680
It's like completely flooded my chat for some reason.

1429
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,180
Thank you.

1430
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,120
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1431
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,660
Oh, money, Yago.

1432
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,980
Let's just keep making things bigger, baby.

1433
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,020
Things are...

1434
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,280
Look at her attack.

1435
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:53,020
I need more haste.

1436
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,220
He's orange and his name is Mango.

1437
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,620
Oh gosh, is he crazy?

1438
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:03,980
I've heard that orange cat... Well, I used to have an orange cat, but he was like the most chill cat ever.

1439
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:08,860
But I've heard that orange cats are like always so crazy.

1440
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:10,500
It's a big sword.

1441
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:12,960
Wait, we increased the size.

1442
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,220
That's a big sword you got there.

1443
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:29,590
Hey Mint, I'm so excited to see you at the Phantom Thief concert on December 14th in Atlanta with tickets still on sale at the Phantom Thief website.

1444
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:31,810
Does not overlap with Hololive's store.

1445
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:32,350
Yeah!

1446
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:44,070
Thank you, Nano, for purchasing a ticket to come see Doki and I's first ever 3D concert, Phantom Thief, December 14th in Atlanta.

1447
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:53,370
Not at the same weekend as Anime Week in Atlanta, but not affiliated with Anime Week in Atlanta and also not on the same day as Hololive's store.

1448
01:18:53,690 --> 01:19:02,690
So you can have a wonderfully jam-packed weekend of VTuber concerts with the Phantom Thief concert and also Hololive's store.

1449
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:05,290
And you can go home feeling so satisfied.

1450
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:14,070
Thanks for helping me shill.

1451
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:17,350
Sorry for being a little shill.

1452
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:19,290
Sorry for...

1453
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:21,490
Sorry.

1454
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:26,570
Okay, we only need 10 more levels.

1455
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:29,470
Or another collab.

1456
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:31,530
Wait, have we gotten the tail yet?

1457
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:32,270
I haven't seen it.

1458
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:35,430
Tail!

1459
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:39,330
Tail, please.

1460
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:42,030
Skipper.

1461
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:42,510
No!

1462
01:19:42,990 --> 01:19:43,850
No skipper.

1463
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:46,010
No skipper.

1464
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:47,330
Skipper, skipper.

1465
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:49,730
Reroll?

1466
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:51,170
Alright.

1467
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:52,630
We'll reroll next time.

1468
01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:54,050
Oh my gosh!

1469
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:56,630
So cute!

1470
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:57,250
So cute!

1471
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,570
I love when Watame wears those glasses.

1472
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:12,440
They remind me of, like, an office party where, like, the guy who...

1473
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,360
Okay, imagine an office party.

1474
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:19,480
And there's, like, always that one guy that is, like, kind of stoic at work.

1475
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:24,760
He's, like, some, like, you know, balding salary man.

1476
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:28,480
But then he puts on those glasses at karaoke and he's just like...

1477
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,000
That's what it reminds me of.

1478
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,000
Like, someone like that would wear it, you know?

1479
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,460
Okay, reroll!

1480
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:36,800
Roll!

1481
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:38,560
Ah, Asakoko!

1482
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,500
And it was enchanted.

1483
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:40,880
Nice.

1484
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:45,180
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1485
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:48,360
Nice.

1486
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:49,580
Easy.

1487
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,100
Guys, we only have 6 minutes left.

1488
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:56,880
Chiara is...

1489
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:01,180
Okay, Kay, if you're still here... If you were even here to begin with, I actually didn't see if you were here or not.

1490
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:04,660
If you're here, don't nerf her.

1491
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,160
Okay, I don't... Whatever you're seeing right now is...

1492
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,260
Whatever you're seeing right now is...

1493
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:13,180
Is an illusion, okay?

1494
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:15,600
Whatever you're seeing right now...

1495
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,100
Is all... It's because of my skill.

1496
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,880
It has nothing else to do with her, okay?

1497
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,640
It's all me.

1498
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,600
Okay, so don't touch her, okay?

1499
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:28,920
She has nothing to do with it.

1500
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,140
It's all me.

1501
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:34,280
I take the blame.

1502
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:35,040
I take the fall.

1503
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,220
Let me play as her always.

1504
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,420
I don't remember.

1505
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,620
Someone mentioned...

1506
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,580
Someone mentioned using Chiara because she was kind of tanky.

1507
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:49,400
And I was like, oh, okay, I'll try.

1508
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:50,560
Oh no, I'm stuck in the trees.

1509
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:53,460
Okay, here we go.

1510
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,900
Let's be in the rocks.

1511
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,220
She is tanky.

1512
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,020
Yeah, so I was just like, oh, I'll try.

1513
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:13,700
Which, I'll be honest, I hadn't played as her very much beforehand.

1514
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:16,180
I think because... I don't know.

1515
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:18,060
I just hadn't played as her very much beforehand.

1516
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,440
And then I was playing a lot with Marin.

1517
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,500
And so, this is why I believe.

1518
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:24,160
Always play as your Oshi, everybody.

1519
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,940
Your Oshi will never let you down.

1520
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,080
Your Oshi will grant you strength.

1521
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:29,360
See?

1522
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,040
That's why this is all...

1523
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,540
This is why it's going so well, everybody.

1524
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:36,080
Because I'm playing as my Oshi and so I'm getting the strength.

1525
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,100
Okay, don't nerf her, please!

1526
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:43,880
This is all me!

1527
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,260
Someone is shooting at me.

1528
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:47,300
See?

1529
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,400
I dodged that myself.

1530
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:50,380
Oh my gosh, I thought that was Gengar for a second.

1531
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:51,880
Greed!

1532
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,380
Bitrate in shambles.

1533
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,420
Oh no, I'm so sorry.

1534
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,400
Okay, we'll nerf her just to spite you.

1535
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:06,960
No!

1536
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,220
Swap crit.

1537
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:13,000
Yeah, my crit is not so high.

1538
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,160
But also this one.

1539
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:19,520
I have... Oh no, I don't... I had the nurse horns in the last thing.

1540
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:20,420
I don't have a healing.

1541
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:24,000
I don't have a healing anything.

1542
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:27,480
So I don't wanna really get rid of the lifesteal.

1543
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:30,480
Crit up is good if you have hope zone.

1544
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:31,200
True!

1545
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,780
Maybe I do size then.

1546
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:46,190
I'm gonna think about it.

1547
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:49,650
I'm gonna rest my eyes.

1548
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:51,130
No, no, sorry.

1549
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:53,750
I'm gonna sleep on it.

1550
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:56,130
Oh gosh, oh my god.

1551
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:57,890
Nice.

1552
01:23:58,610 --> 01:23:58,910
Gimme.

1553
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:03,990
I need more Asakusa.

1554
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:04,730
Thank you.

1555
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:06,010
Oh!

1556
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:13,360
You know what?

1557
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,420
That's so true.

1558
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,940
We're too late game and I'm not doing endless mode everybody.

1559
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,560
Chiara is pretty balanced actually.

1560
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,200
I think the one who truly needs nerfing is a certain ghost in her 3's.

1561
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:31,120
I haven't nerfed Iris or Mume in the past couple of updates.

1562
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:31,900
I think Chiara is safe.

1563
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,060
Thank you!

1564
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,200
Yippee!

1565
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,960
While the special meter is still charging, increase crit.

1566
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:40,900
Oh my god.

1567
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:44,580
Do we want crit to just be insane?

1568
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,620
But also we don't really need the damage of the skill attack I'd say.

1569
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,200
Also thanks for the super chat Kay.

1570
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:52,720
Stop it.

1571
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,160
Go away.

1572
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:55,600
Get out of here.

1573
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:56,720
Get out of here.

1574
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,100
I don't know.

1575
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,020
Your special is never charging.

1576
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:06,720
That's true.

1577
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:07,920
I don't use it very often.

1578
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:10,940
I don't use it.

1579
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,840
I'm so bad about things like...

1580
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:16,480
No.

1581
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:17,200
OK.

1582
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:18,400
And I'll take my money.

1583
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:18,900
Thank you.

1584
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,560
We have a life steal!

1585
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,360
OK, now...

1586
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:25,160
Swap.

1587
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:28,840
Wait, what did I just do?

1588
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:29,140
Oh.

1589
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:30,640
Strengthen.

1590
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,760
There we go everybody.

1591
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,860
And that's how you make money.

1592
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,940
That's how you do a deal.

1593
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,700
That's how you sign the paperwork.

1594
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:46,100
That's how you...

1595
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:48,800
Oh gosh.

1596
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:53,680
That's how you become your own boss, babe.

1597
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,140
The greed.

1598
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,800
I know it feels a little less exciting getting it now.

1599
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,440
What is this?

1600
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:07,260
Wait.

1601
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:08,100
What is it?

1602
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,580
Oh wait, it was the... that thing.

1603
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,100
I'm gonna grab...

1604
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:19,220
Yeah, it was the gold anvil.

1605
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:19,660
Thank you.

1606
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,880
Spider cooking with tears?

1607
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:23,540
There it is.

1608
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:24,600
OK.

1609
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:26,440
Oh my gosh, this is my first time.

1610
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:50,150
Shoot lightning-charged wieners.

1611
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:53,790
That home into targets and summon lightnings to strike them down.

1612
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,140
And now we just need the hammer.

1613
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:04,380
And we'll get everything.

1614
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:04,820
You know what?

1615
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,040
I'm gonna summon now.

1616
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:13,260
It doesn't do so much here, but it's, you know, a little bit at least.

1617
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,360
Actually, that did help a little bit.

1618
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:19,420
Very good.

1619
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:21,520
Where's the wieners?

1620
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:24,440
I don't see it.

1621
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:25,960
Oh, I see it, I see it, I see it.

1622
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,280
Oh my gosh, I see the lightning.

1623
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,300
It was just too fast.

1624
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,380
Guys, our haste is insane, OK?

1625
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,640
The wieners were too fast.

1626
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:37,300
Oh, wow.

1627
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:40,480
Spider cooking.

1628
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:45,210
Hey, aunt.

1629
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:46,210
Welcome to my village.

1630
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:47,030
Thank you.

1631
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:47,850
Thank you so much.

1632
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:54,810
If anybody is still here that came from the raid, the collab, how was the collab?

1633
01:27:55,050 --> 01:27:55,590
Was it fun?

1634
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:03,540
Did you have fun?

1635
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:04,840
It was great?

1636
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:04,920
OK.

1637
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,760
What are they playing?

1638
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:16,940
That one game...

1639
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:19,400
What was it called?

1640
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:21,840
Liar's Bar.

1641
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:22,760
Yes.

1642
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:25,420
I was like...

1643
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,580
Yeah, I love Liar's Bar.

1644
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,440
Let's talk about the membership.

1645
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:35,420
You literally played it.

1646
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:35,760
I know.

1647
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:36,940
I forgot the name of it though.

1648
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,380
What are you going to do?

1649
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:38,800
Sue me?

1650
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:41,720
I'm gaming right now.

1651
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,340
I don't have time to be thinking about Liar's Bar.

1652
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:48,060
Let's enchant.

1653
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:52,520
What's this?

1654
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,680
Get out of my way, please.

1655
01:28:58,060 --> 01:28:58,540
Yippee!

1656
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:00,820
I failed.

1657
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,180
Thank you for the 20th day.

1658
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,560
Guys, this might be my luckiest run ever.

1659
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:14,000
I have to uninstall the game after this.

1660
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:20,140
I have to uninstall the game after this, I think.

1661
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:22,900
I can't keep going like this.

1662
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:24,160
It's unfair.

1663
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:28,320
It's unfair to the average, you know...

1664
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:31,760
To the average player.

1665
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:33,560
To you measly mortals, you know.

1666
01:29:41,530 --> 01:29:44,630
Has a 20% bonus crit chance.

1667
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:47,540
Also increases critical hit damage by 30%.

1668
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:49,650
True infinite BL works.

1669
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:56,310
Oh my god, it takes up the whole screen.

1670
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:57,230
It's craziness.

1671
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:01,990
We are close.

1672
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:02,890
We are incoming.

1673
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:05,690
Final boss!

1674
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:08,790
Where is my... There it is.

1675
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:25,970
Final boss!

1676
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:29,770
Oh gosh.

1677
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:30,430
My health.

1678
01:30:32,490 --> 01:30:33,170
Not good.

1679
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:33,510
Not good.

1680
01:30:33,550 --> 01:30:33,790
Not good.

1681
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:34,110
Not good.

1682
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:34,750
Not good.

1683
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:35,030
Not good.

1684
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:35,330
Not good.

1685
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:42,660
I can't see anything because the BL is taking up so... It's so insane.

1686
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,240
Oh god!

1687
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,600
I even lowered the opacity right before the stream.

1688
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:13,660
We

1689
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,720
are losing big... We are losing mega health.

1690
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:21,340
Oh god.

1691
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:21,940
Oh god, you guys.

1692
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:22,980
Oh god, I need health.

1693
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:23,520
I need health.

1694
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:24,760
Run!

1695
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:25,580
Run, Kiwawa!

1696
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:31,610
Just gather health, Kiwawa!

1697
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:33,550
Oh god.

1698
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:35,770
Guys, this isn't looking so hot.

1699
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:36,850
I'll be honest.

1700
01:31:37,390 --> 01:31:37,770
Oh my god.

1701
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:38,730
Oh my god.

1702
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:39,790
Oh my god.

1703
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:40,570
Oh my god.

1704
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:45,190
Don't forget the dash.

1705
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:46,470
Oh yeah, thanks guys.

1706
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:51,350
I did forget I have dash.

1707
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,490
I did forget.

1708
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:54,710
I did forget.

1709
01:31:59,370 --> 01:32:01,490
It's because, like, it's...

1710
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:04,070
I didn't forget!

1711
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:08,790
Oh god, I'm stuck on a tree!

1712
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:13,460
I'm scared.

1713
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:18,540
OK.

1714
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:19,720
We are alright.

1715
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,160
We are OK-ish.

1716
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:26,420
We are OK-ish.

1717
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:29,880
Oh my god.

1718
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:30,280
Oh my god.

1719
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:46,700
First!

1720
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:48,480
Stage 4 first try!

1721
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,440
Stage 5 first try!

1722
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,760
This is my first time ever even playing this stage.

1723
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,060
What the heck?

1724
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:01,580
Owl dagger.

1725
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,220
A very fast dagger that slashes continuously in front.

1726
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:06,580
Ilfried, thank you!

1727
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,140
A weapon to surprise Pekodom.

1728
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:10,140
Kiwawa!

1729
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:16,340
Kiwawa!

1730
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,040
Kiwawa!

1731
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:23,710
OK, it's about... It's time to turn off the cheat codes I told you about.

1732
01:33:26,190 --> 01:33:27,230
Yes, mom.

1733
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,960
I knew it!

1734
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

1735
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:40,620
Yeah, busted!

1736
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,180
Hey guys, I'm a ghost.

1737
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:46,580
Wow.

1738
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:51,160
And I didn't even have gachikoi status for that.

1739
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,080
Kiwawa the goat.

1740
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:02,480
So I have the hard holo offices, but I don't have the hard anything else.

1741
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:08,260
Should we try going hard?

1742
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,440
Unplug the game shark.

1743
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:17,440
If you type Minky at the start screen...

1744
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:23,230
Let's go hard.

1745
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:26,010
Let's go hard.

1746
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:30,270
Oh my gosh.

1747
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,190
Let's try it.

1748
01:34:33,290 --> 01:34:34,210
My dash.

1749
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:37,010
OK.

1750
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:40,190
And we're now gachikoi, so...

1751
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:45,530
I'm... My... I'm a little unwell.

1752
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:50,350
I'm so gachikoi, Kiwawa.

1753
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:59,430
I don't typically like characters that I have to focus so much on aiming.

1754
01:35:00,410 --> 01:35:02,810
Because I like to kind of just run around.

1755
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:04,210
I'm gonna grab some CEO tears.

1756
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:06,390
Feeling freaky?

1757
01:35:06,970 --> 01:35:07,630
Absolutely.

1758
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:14,230
Kiwawa, gachikoi for you.

1759
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:16,810
Let's do... What was it?

1760
01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:18,210
Sausage and BL book?

1761
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:19,010
Let's try that now.

1762
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:20,050
I wanna see it.

1763
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:21,870
I didn't need that.

1764
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:25,010
Ian cursed an owl dagger.

1765
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:26,010
Oh, OK.

1766
01:35:26,730 --> 01:35:28,110
I did not know that was a thing.

1767
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:29,450
I will try it.

1768
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:30,410
Thank you.

1769
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,920
I like Sana and Mumei because of that.

1770
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:39,520
Me too.

1771
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,380
And Fauna a lot too.

1772
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:53,380
One thing that I've been trying a lot for has been the achievement where you just stand there, you know?

1773
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,500
I'm gonna get the Nurse's Horn because, again, a healing item.

1774
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:00,520
But I cannot...

1775
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,760
For the life of me, do it.

1776
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:05,500
The no move one.

1777
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:06,720
I've tried it with Fauna.

1778
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:07,860
I think I'm just dumb.

1779
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:15,710
And then also because I keep failing at it, I don't get any more like...

1780
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:19,960
Like I'll try someone and I don't get any more fandom points.

1781
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:23,020
Actually, I think I have Fauna gachikoi.

1782
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:23,460
I'm not sure.

1783
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:28,340
Anya for it.

1784
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:29,100
Try Anya.

1785
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:29,400
OK.

1786
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,720
I'll get her up.

1787
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:36,940
No move with Hachama.

1788
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,680
I've also tried Sana with it as well.

1789
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:51,000
I like the sunset version of this map.

1790
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:52,460
It's pretty.

1791
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:02,280
Sausage!

1792
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,380
It's making me hungry.

1793
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:07,920
Sausage.

1794
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:10,320
Who's the sausage I referenced to?

1795
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,800
A lot of people recommended Fauna.

1796
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,180
Subaru.

1797
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:24,220
Subaru played a game.

1798
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,680
Sausage Legends.

1799
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,660
What is Sausage Legends?

1800
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:36,900
I used to play a sausage game a lot.

1801
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,180
I see, I see.

1802
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:42,780
You guys have so much knowledge.

1803
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,280
I'll take that carrot.

1804
01:38:01,690 --> 01:38:03,370
Sword fighting with sausage.

1805
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:08,350
Guys, I don't...

1806
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:12,630
I don't know what's happening.

1807
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:20,770
Reach 500 pickup!

1808
01:38:21,170 --> 01:38:22,150
Oh my god!

1809
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:40,630
I'm not cheating!

1810
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:44,370
I'm not a cheater cheater pumpkin eater.

1811
01:38:44,630 --> 01:38:45,930
Well, I am a pumpkin eater.

1812
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:48,970
Checker PC.

1813
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:50,810
I think Mint needs a nerf.

1814
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:53,470
Great resume.

1815
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:54,210
Thank you.

1816
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:56,550
Alexander, thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

1817
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:02,810
This is not referencing Bay's sausage game.

1818
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:04,030
I remember that.

1819
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:07,830
I remember that.

1820
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:15,490
I was still so shocked that they were allowed to play that game.

1821
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:18,970
I was like, how the hell?

1822
01:39:19,730 --> 01:39:21,130
Did they get approval for this?

1823
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:26,390
So you lied about unplugging the GameShark?

1824
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:30,290
I can never unplug.

1825
01:39:31,870 --> 01:39:33,890
I'm married to the game.

1826
01:39:34,130 --> 01:39:35,970
You guys, I'm married to my work.

1827
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:37,430
I can never unplug.

1828
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:39,870
You die in the game.

1829
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:42,190
You die...

1830
01:39:42,190 --> 01:39:44,190
Wait, you unplug...

1831
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:50,130
You can unplug the cheats, but you can't unplug the cheater from...

1832
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:51,150
Wait, the game?

1833
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:52,030
Hold on.

1834
01:39:52,130 --> 01:39:58,090
You can unplug the game, but you can't unplug the gamer from the game.

1835
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:09,480
Has she even had any run without a super item so far?

1836
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,000
I don't think so.

1837
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:16,420
Oh no, I should have done the sword.

1838
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:18,520
Size.

1839
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,340
Bigger, bigger, bigger.

1840
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,880
Wait, I want to enchant this as well.

1841
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:25,240
Nice.

1842
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:26,560
Bigger.

1843
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:28,280
Bigger, badder, better.

1844
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:29,700
Nailed it.

1845
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,060
You get what I'm saying anyway.

1846
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:34,080
You know what I'm talking about.

1847
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:34,860
You know what I'm saying.

1848
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:38,000
Don't act like you don't know.

1849
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:39,380
Haste!

1850
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:44,300
Can you unplug the plug type Asakoko?

1851
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:45,860
Why would you want to?

1852
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:55,880
Unless you're getting a little sore.

1853
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:57,620
It's hard to sit down.

1854
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:03,980
Some say that's the best part.

1855
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,160
Unplug?

1856
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:08,220
I wouldn't know.

1857
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:11,140
Wait, really?

1858
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,980
Then why do you even plug it in the beginning?

1859
01:41:18,830 --> 01:41:19,610
What's that?

1860
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:25,010
More haste.

1861
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:27,790
So you can unplug it.

1862
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,320
Oh my god.

1863
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:35,160
I'm trapped.

1864
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,160
Sword!

1865
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:43,300
They're going to trap me in.

1866
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:44,800
They're going to trap me in real.

1867
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:47,000
No HALU.

1868
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:48,140
In fact, I deleted it.

1869
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:49,880
No asking for HALU.

1870
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:52,520
Awaken.

1871
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:57,000
No HALU.

1872
01:41:57,380 --> 01:41:58,640
Don't even ask.

1873
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:00,560
Don't even ask for Christmas.

1874
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,720
You won't get it.

1875
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:10,940
Horde.

1876
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:12,740
I'll take a glow stick.

1877
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:16,740
Guys, that one wasn't a super super.

1878
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,460
It was a normal 3-1.

1879
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:21,540
You guys don't get those often?

1880
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,920
It came with the version I downloaded.

1881
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:34,400
It said this version for Minto Fantomu use only.

1882
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:39,040
You guys don't have that one?

1883
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:42,200
Okay.

1884
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:47,080
I honestly don't know.

1885
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:48,540
I've heard some people say that...

1886
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:52,400
I don't know if this has been confirmed or not, but if you have OBS open...

1887
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:55,680
It like, something triggers in the game.

1888
01:42:57,220 --> 01:43:00,080
And it makes you drop more stuff.

1889
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:01,580
I don't know if that's true or not.

1890
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,720
It is true?

1891
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:10,560
Oh, is it cope?

1892
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:10,940
Oh.

1893
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:15,440
I thought...

1894
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:18,000
Wait, what was I combining Owl Dagger with, you guys?

1895
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:19,720
Oh, wait.

1896
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:20,180
Uh-oh.

1897
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:20,760
Wait.

1898
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:22,780
What was I combining it with?

1899
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:24,860
Ian Curse.

1900
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:25,480
Oh, no!

1901
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,000
I messed up.

1902
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:33,560
Guys, I messed up.

1903
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:38,240
I don't have Axe or Ian Curse.

1904
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:39,920
Oopsie.

1905
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:41,520
We'll

1906
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:45,190
be combining.

1907
01:43:45,310 --> 01:43:45,970
We'll be combining.

1908
01:43:48,230 --> 01:43:49,490
Don't worry, we'll be combining.

1909
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,560
Yeah, slots will open up.

1910
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:55,880
Don't worry.

1911
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:57,120
I'm curious.

1912
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:58,200
Oh, it did say what?

1913
01:43:58,280 --> 01:43:59,180
It's like a little slash.

1914
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:02,060
Hi.

1915
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,820
Can't believe my Oshie is flexing her streamer life.

1916
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,300
I honestly don't know what's going on.

1917
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:15,200
But I told you this happened earlier.

1918
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:15,840
I think...

1919
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,460
I think there's something actually wrong with my game.

1920
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:25,080
Nice dodge.

1921
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:25,800
Nice dodge.

1922
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,120
Nice dodge.

1923
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:27,820
Nice dodge.

1924
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:28,940
Nice dodge.

1925
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:29,580
Nice dodge.

1926
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:32,360
Nice dodge.

1927
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:32,980
Nice dodge.

1928
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:33,620
Nice dodge.

1929
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:35,460
Okay.

1930
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,840
Okay, take that.

1931
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:58,770
Soon we will get the gold.

1932
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:03,450
Soon we will get the gold.

1933
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:05,050
Any second now.

1934
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:07,910
Someone who is polite...

1935
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:08,390
There we go.

1936
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:18,030
Legendary sausage.

1937
01:45:18,390 --> 01:45:20,090
A continuously spinning sausage.

1938
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:22,070
Spins faster as you move.

1939
01:45:22,330 --> 01:45:23,650
Which I do a lot.

1940
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:24,530
Oh my god.

1941
01:45:24,670 --> 01:45:25,570
Oh my god.

1942
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:27,350
I have to move a lot because of Kiara.

1943
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:28,490
Oh my god.

1944
01:45:32,770 --> 01:45:34,910
It's kind of really gross looking.

1945
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:36,450
Sorry Shuba.

1946
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:40,490
It's actually kind of hideous.

1947
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:41,590
I'm not gonna lie.

1948
01:45:43,690 --> 01:45:45,130
Oh god.

1949
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:48,010
It reminds me of those long furbies.

1950
01:45:52,890 --> 01:45:55,110
Alright, now we get the curse.

1951
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:57,710
We must be cursed.

1952
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:00,830
Helicopter.

1953
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:01,550
Helicopter.

1954
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:04,470
Helicopter.

1955
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:05,110
Helicopter.

1956
01:46:06,010 --> 01:46:07,690
I need more haste.

1957
01:46:08,190 --> 01:46:10,830
I need to be the fastest there is.

1958
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:13,250
Keep moving.

1959
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:14,150
I don't stop.

1960
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:16,310
I literally just keep moving.

1961
01:46:16,450 --> 01:46:17,330
I don't stop moving.

1962
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:22,640
Yeah, we need candy.

1963
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:26,480
We need nightly milk.

1964
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,220
We need...

1965
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:32,840
I don't stop moving.

1966
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,540
You can't make me.

1967
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:38,260
I needed...

1968
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:39,280
What else?

1969
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:42,220
Curse!

1970
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:43,620
That's what I needed.

1971
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:45,480
Alright guys.

1972
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:46,200
Lucky, lucky.

1973
01:46:50,990 --> 01:46:51,950
Wait, what was that?

1974
01:46:52,170 --> 01:46:52,810
What did I pick up?

1975
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:54,730
It's not weird.

1976
01:46:54,830 --> 01:46:55,990
They are often shaped like this.

1977
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,000
Oh god.

1978
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,000
Easy.

1979
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:11,140
Easy peasy, everybody.

1980
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:17,820
Close.

1981
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:29,910
Dare I say, Kiara may be the greatest of all time.

1982
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:32,190
Fastest ghost in the web.

1983
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:33,970
Don't you know it?

1984
01:47:35,450 --> 01:47:36,870
Let's do enchant.

1985
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:36,930
Enchant.

1986
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:42,230
The normal boxes almost seem odd.

1987
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:43,470
Don't say that!

1988
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:48,770
Is there an endless hard mode?

1989
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:51,710
I haven't tried.

1990
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:57,310
There is.

1991
01:47:58,670 --> 01:47:59,130
Yeah.

1992
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:05,320
I don't feel ready for it.

1993
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,940
I don't feel ready for it.

1994
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:07,440
I'm scared.

1995
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:07,520
I'm scared.

1996
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:11,660
Tears.

1997
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:13,260
What is this?

1998
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:15,460
Sure.

1999
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,460
We can try and get more stamps, right?

2000
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,080
Alright, everybody die.

2001
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:23,800
Everybody drop dead.

2002
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:28,340
Endless with Halu.

2003
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:34,700
I wish I could have been one of the crazies that...

2004
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:36,700
Got a million...

2005
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,480
In one try.

2006
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:42,640
Oh god.

2007
01:48:46,350 --> 01:48:46,930
What the?

2008
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:48,450
I killed him so fast.

2009
01:48:50,950 --> 01:48:52,510
Sorry, 30 million.

2010
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:55,550
Sorry to... I didn't mean to...

2011
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:04,770
To minimize your achievements or anything like that.

2012
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:05,390
I'm so sorry.

2013
01:49:09,370 --> 01:49:10,150
Dival... No!

2014
01:49:13,150 --> 01:49:14,030
More owl.

2015
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:16,790
I can't even see the owl dagger.

2016
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:20,530
Like, I don't even know what it looks like, where it is...

2017
01:49:20,530 --> 01:49:22,030
What it's doing...

2018
01:49:22,030 --> 01:49:24,050
Like, I just believe that I have it.

2019
01:49:24,510 --> 01:49:25,750
But I don't see it at all.

2020
01:49:26,450 --> 01:49:27,330
It's just there.

2021
01:49:28,010 --> 01:49:28,470
Hello, Mito.

2022
01:49:28,730 --> 01:49:29,050
Hello!

2023
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:31,230
Oh, it's a Bebo stamp.

2024
01:49:33,010 --> 01:49:35,630
But I can't use this one, because it says while not moving.

2025
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:38,350
And that does not work with our build.

2026
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:41,730
Oh, we're already here!

2027
01:49:41,950 --> 01:49:42,570
Oh my god.

2028
01:49:42,830 --> 01:49:43,770
We're already here!

2029
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:44,430
OK.

2030
01:49:45,110 --> 01:49:45,370
OK.

2031
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:46,350
OK.

2032
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:47,410
OK.

2033
01:49:52,130 --> 01:49:52,650
What?

2034
01:49:55,310 --> 01:49:56,010
That's right.

2035
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:59,050
That's exactly how it was in the first one.

2036
01:50:00,310 --> 01:50:00,590
OK.

2037
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:01,490
We're fine.

2038
01:50:01,650 --> 01:50:02,210
Everything is good.

2039
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:03,570
Everything is OK.

2040
01:50:03,570 --> 01:50:03,630
OK.

2041
01:50:06,630 --> 01:50:07,670
Everything is alright.

2042
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:12,390
Oh my god.

2043
01:50:12,530 --> 01:50:13,730
There is so much happening here.

2044
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:19,010
I like the little tears.

2045
01:50:22,370 --> 01:50:23,670
Let's get one down.

2046
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:25,510
Let's get like a Chan down or something.

2047
01:50:25,730 --> 01:50:27,050
And then we can get...

2048
01:50:27,570 --> 01:50:28,690
We can get Mikocchi.

2049
01:50:33,690 --> 01:50:35,390
Asakoko inject for real hard mode.

2050
01:50:35,490 --> 01:50:40,170
Yeah, but then you get the Kusogaki shackles and it doesn't mean...

2051
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:41,610
It's all good.

2052
01:50:41,870 --> 01:50:42,550
It's so easy.

2053
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:44,030
You know?

2054
01:50:45,930 --> 01:50:48,750
You get the Kusogaki shackles and then everything is fine.

2055
01:50:49,810 --> 01:50:51,250
Piece of 8 Chan down.

2056
01:50:52,350 --> 01:50:55,310
Why do I keep getting the good Will's pill?

2057
01:50:56,230 --> 01:50:57,170
I don't need it.

2058
01:50:57,270 --> 01:50:57,710
I don't need it.

2059
01:50:57,830 --> 01:50:57,990
Drop.

2060
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:00,490
Not this time.

2061
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:05,510
Yeah!

2062
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:09,810
Alright.

2063
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,060
Let me out of my box!

2064
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,700
Please, let me in.

2065
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,060
Guys, I used up all my...

2066
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:27,040
I used up all my luck...

2067
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:31,740
In the previous game.

2068
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:32,480
I'm telling you.

2069
01:51:39,950 --> 01:51:41,370
What is this guy doing?

2070
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:42,930
The other guy is health.

2071
01:51:43,170 --> 01:51:45,730
Oh, is this guy buffing them with strength or something?

2072
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:52,200
And this guy is buffing them with...

2073
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:53,880
I don't even know.

2074
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,820
He lowers your attack.

2075
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:00,240
He debuffs me!

2076
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,800
Not on my watch.

2077
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:06,240
He is going to get sausaged.

2078
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:08,500
He is sausaged.

2079
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:11,760
Oh no!

2080
01:52:12,340 --> 01:52:13,260
There are two of them.

2081
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:15,180
Disgusting.

2082
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:16,680
Otaku!

2083
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:17,860
Kimoi!

2084
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:21,820
It's right there.

2085
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,920
Injection type Asakoko.

2086
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:27,160
It's right there.

2087
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:29,520
It's right there.

2088
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:33,220
Use dash?

2089
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:34,160
I don't need to.

2090
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:35,500
I haven't had to for...

2091
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:42,240
I haven't had to use dash.

2092
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:42,960
I'm too good.

2093
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,380
You guys caused that.

2094
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:04,740
A historically deadly disease that...

2095
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:07,420
Continuously spreads to any target nearby...

2096
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:10,080
Has a very small chance to defeat a target instantly.

2097
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:13,480
Oh my gosh.

2098
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:14,400
It's disgusting.

2099
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:30,040
I've never seen that before.

2100
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,100
It's so awful.

2101
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:35,360
It's so awful.

2102
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,920
Oh my gosh.

2103
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:40,180
Oh, these are the mushrooms.

2104
01:53:40,660 --> 01:53:42,080
I was like, what is this?

2105
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:43,460
On the ground.

2106
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:44,800
These are the mushrooms that...

2107
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,740
Okay, so it hasn't dropped a single stamp.

2108
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:47,900
Only a bunch of mushrooms.

2109
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:49,840
It's kind of useless maybe.

2110
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:01,540
Oh, just kidding.

2111
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:02,240
It dropped something.

2112
01:54:24,890 --> 01:54:25,350
Bigger.

2113
01:54:26,730 --> 01:54:30,310
Big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big.

2114
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:32,570
Big, big, big, big, big, big, big.

2115
01:54:32,690 --> 01:54:34,570
Look at the size of that thing.

2116
01:54:37,450 --> 01:54:39,810
What should we collab?

2117
01:54:44,230 --> 01:54:46,630
I guess whatever with glow stick?

2118
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:49,030
We've gotten barely any items.

2119
01:54:50,350 --> 01:54:54,170
We've gotten barely any items, man.

2120
01:54:57,510 --> 01:54:58,850
All weapons.

2121
01:54:59,330 --> 01:55:00,330
No defense.

2122
01:55:00,490 --> 01:55:01,350
All attack.

2123
01:55:05,290 --> 01:55:06,330
Oh, wait.

2124
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:07,110
Fanbeam.

2125
01:55:07,290 --> 01:55:07,970
Oh, hold on.

2126
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:10,850
Fanbeam and glow stick.

2127
01:55:12,850 --> 01:55:15,270
Oh, I can do fanbeam for either of these.

2128
01:55:15,630 --> 01:55:16,390
Let's get it.

2129
01:55:22,260 --> 01:55:22,700
Alright.

2130
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:24,560
13 minutes.

2131
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:32,280
Oh, slow, slow, slow, slow.

2132
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:36,340
Oh, speaking of slow, slow, slow.

2133
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:41,820
We'll go towards a big, big, big, big, big, big.

2134
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:43,380
We're the biggest there ever was.

2135
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,560
We're the biggest there ever was.

2136
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:49,480
I'm... I'm... Lady VTuber.

2137
01:55:50,180 --> 01:55:52,420
What was the category again?

2138
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:54,280
Lady VTuber.

2139
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:05,860
After using special, gain a 25 second buff that increases the damage of all ranged and multi shot.

2140
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:07,640
I'm OK.

2141
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:12,200
Madam VTuber.

2142
01:56:19,650 --> 01:56:21,370
I'm Madam VTuber.

2143
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:29,520
Miss VTuber.

2144
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:34,860
Maybe.

2145
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:36,000
If you vote for me.

2146
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:40,280
I think getting nominated is enough though.

2147
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:44,440
I gotta vote for...

2148
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:47,500
I think Kiara is also up for it though.

2149
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:51,640
After all of this... I mean I was gonna vote for her anyway, but after all of this...

2150
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:52,880
I have to vote for Kiara.

2151
01:56:54,180 --> 01:56:55,120
There's no way.

2152
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:59,000
There's no way that I can't not vote for her, you know.

2153
01:56:59,620 --> 01:57:00,560
No, slow.

2154
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:02,220
Slow, slow.

2155
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,100
Super chat time.

2156
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:08,460
Oh, but I must resist.

2157
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:16,880
IDK how to vote.

2158
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,720
I think you go to the VTuber reward site and then you...

2159
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:24,180
Google... I don't... Actually, I don't know actually.

2160
01:57:26,860 --> 01:57:30,080
You have to log in to your Google account?

2161
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:31,720
Maybe I think...

2162
01:57:46,330 --> 01:57:47,470
I'm not quite...

2163
01:57:47,470 --> 01:57:49,090
Yeah, your Google account.

2164
01:57:49,150 --> 01:57:49,370
OK.

2165
01:57:50,410 --> 01:57:51,190
I thought so.

2166
01:58:06,610 --> 01:58:07,350
Come here.

2167
01:58:08,950 --> 01:58:10,970
I will... Oh, I will super.

2168
01:58:11,450 --> 01:58:12,390
I mean, not super.

2169
01:58:12,570 --> 01:58:13,850
I will...

2170
01:58:13,850 --> 01:58:15,830
I will...

2171
01:58:15,830 --> 01:58:16,490
Special.

2172
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:22,270
Imagine if you and Kiara end up one vote off and it was your vote for her that makes her win it.

2173
01:58:22,490 --> 01:58:25,210
That would be so romantic.

2174
01:58:26,330 --> 01:58:26,810
Greed.

2175
01:58:27,230 --> 01:58:27,930
Goodbye greed.

2176
01:58:29,790 --> 01:58:31,750
We're not doing money run this time.

2177
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:34,710
It's survival, baby.

2178
01:58:34,930 --> 01:58:36,070
It's all about survival.

2179
01:58:36,650 --> 01:58:37,750
The nightly milk!

2180
01:58:39,610 --> 01:58:43,170
Why did I think that nightly milk also did...

2181
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:45,550
Also did...

2182
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:46,470
Haste.

2183
01:58:46,930 --> 01:58:47,470
Am I crazy?

2184
01:58:49,590 --> 01:58:50,650
I'm so slow!

2185
01:58:52,010 --> 01:58:53,470
Screw these guys, man.

2186
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:57,790
They're throwing off my vibes.

2187
01:58:58,850 --> 01:58:59,730
Another one.

2188
01:59:00,150 --> 01:59:02,070
Get all these kimo otaku out of here.

2189
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:06,030
Who even invited you?

2190
01:59:06,330 --> 01:59:07,530
Which one should I do, you guys?

2191
01:59:07,610 --> 01:59:09,450
We can do either one with the fan beam.

2192
01:59:12,030 --> 01:59:12,910
Which one?

2193
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:18,340
Oh, because I always get super.

2194
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:21,800
Tears?

2195
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:23,040
Tear, tear, tear.

2196
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:27,800
Stream of tears!

2197
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:30,420
Nothing can stop the stream of tears.

2198
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:37,540
Is that it?

2199
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:41,420
It's just spinning around.

2200
01:59:41,580 --> 01:59:42,600
We gotta get more haste.

2201
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:43,760
We need candy.

2202
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:48,940
Alright, next time we see a baby, we're stealing candy from them.

2203
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:50,240
Oh my gosh.

2204
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,300
Have you guys... Did you know...

2205
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:55,400
Okay, there's one part in the...

2206
01:59:56,060 --> 01:59:56,980
What's it called?

2207
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:02,460
In the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory movie.

2208
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:04,680
Where... Oh my god!

2209
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:09,980
Where the guy is singing the song, the Candyman song.

2210
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,060
And there's this little girl.

2211
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:14,600
He opens up a counter to let the children in too.

2212
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:16,220
I guess behind the shop.

2213
02:00:16,620 --> 02:00:18,620
I don't know why he's giving away candy for free.

2214
02:00:18,620 --> 02:00:21,860
But letting poor Charlie...

2215
02:00:21,860 --> 02:00:23,800
Stand outside hungry.

2216
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:27,560
He doesn't get any free candy because he's poor.

2217
02:00:28,860 --> 02:00:29,660
It's so sad.

2218
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:30,320
But anyway.

2219
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:31,420
And the new one or old one?

2220
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:31,960
The old one!

2221
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,240
And he's like making all the candy go everywhere.

2222
02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:40,500
And he opens up the counter for the children to run by.

2223
02:00:40,620 --> 02:00:43,240
But there's a little girl right in front of the counter.

2224
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:48,200
And her chin is like right above the counter top.

2225
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:51,040
And it's one of those counter tops that you like lift up.

2226
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:55,920
It's one of those counter tops you gotta lift up, right?

2227
02:00:58,380 --> 02:00:58,860
Reroll?

2228
02:00:58,980 --> 02:00:59,120
OK.

2229
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:03,140
For whammy, someone said?

2230
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:04,540
Oh yeah, we can do whammy.

2231
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:07,500
And...

2232
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:11,660
You just watch her head go...

2233
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:14,920
Right?

2234
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:17,400
I guess they couldn't do it.

2235
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:17,900
Oh my god.

2236
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:21,360
Guys...

2237
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:23,880
Am I gonna live?

2238
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:25,220
Guys...

2239
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:25,880
Oh, I lived.

2240
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:27,580
I don't know how.

2241
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:31,320
I don't know how I lived, but...

2242
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:37,580
But yeah, it's so funny.

2243
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:40,940
They were just like, yeah.

2244
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:43,080
She was such a trooper about it.

2245
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:44,400
She took it like a champ.

2246
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:46,840
And then went and got her candy.

2247
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:55,400
I don't remember that part.

2248
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:56,320
It's like very...

2249
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:57,760
If you...

2250
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:00,440
It's kind of one of those things where it's like you have to notice it.

2251
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:02,920
If you don't notice it, like you're not gonna see it.

2252
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:03,660
Kind of...

2253
02:02:03,660 --> 02:02:04,960
Kind of a...

2254
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:05,400
Oh my goodness.

2255
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:06,060
Oh my goodness.

2256
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:07,260
Situation.

2257
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:10,380
Nice.

2258
02:02:11,580 --> 02:02:11,940
Whammy.

2259
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:17,340
Babycore, thanks for the gifted.

2260
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:20,800
Like the stormtrooper hitting their head.

2261
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,060
Wait, I don't know that one.

2262
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:27,880
Like there's probably such funny things in the backgrounds of movies.

2263
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:31,800
I also discovered a movie the other day called...

2264
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:34,180
Pup Star?

2265
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:35,800
I think.

2266
02:02:36,940 --> 02:02:39,240
Do you guys know that movie, Pup Star?

2267
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:41,100
Apparently there's like five of them.

2268
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:45,680
But the way they make the dogs sing.

2269
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:47,460
It's about like singing dogs.

2270
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:49,800
I didn't know that Air Bud...

2271
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:51,900
Like, you know the Air Bud movies?

2272
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:54,800
They now are like a company that make these really...

2273
02:02:58,320 --> 02:02:58,680
Strange...

2274
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:00,480
Like dog movies.

2275
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:04,820
Babycore, thanks for the gifted.

2276
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:05,760
Wait, did I say that already?

2277
02:03:05,940 --> 02:03:06,640
Well, anyway, thank you.

2278
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:11,480
I'm losing track because I'm like talking and playing at the same time.

2279
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:13,840
But...

2280
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:19,800
If I could just show you guys how goofy these dogs look while singing.

2281
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:27,420
I guess things got to them after Air Buddies succeeded.

2282
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:28,960
Air Buddies.

2283
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:31,220
All the talking animal movies.

2284
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:34,360
Yeah, they've like done I guess a ton of like talking animals.

2285
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:35,780
But Air Bud never...

2286
02:03:35,780 --> 02:03:37,520
Actually, I don't think I've ever watched Air Bud.

2287
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:39,800
But I don't think he talked in it.

2288
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:41,240
He just played basketball, right?

2289
02:03:41,740 --> 02:03:43,180
He was just the b-ball dog.

2290
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:45,380
I don't think he talked.

2291
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:50,640
Oh gosh, I'm just gonna run.

2292
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:52,060
I'm just gonna run.

2293
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:54,380
Nevermind.

2294
02:04:21,210 --> 02:04:22,050
Knockback.

2295
02:04:27,310 --> 02:04:29,110
I'm gonna swap out.

2296
02:04:38,540 --> 02:04:38,900
Shoot.

2297
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:39,660
Oh my god.

2298
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:40,420
Oh my god, you guys.

2299
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:41,580
I'm gonna die.

2300
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:42,100
I'm gonna die.

2301
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:42,920
I'm gonna die.

2302
02:04:43,420 --> 02:04:45,560
Run, run, run, Kiwawa.

2303
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:46,860
Run, run, run, Kiwawa.

2304
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:47,500
Run, run, run.

2305
02:04:47,620 --> 02:04:48,520
Get out of here.

2306
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:49,380
Oh my gosh.

2307
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:50,820
Oh gosh.

2308
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:53,080
I'm gonna die.

2309
02:04:53,180 --> 02:04:53,680
I'm gonna die.

2310
02:04:53,740 --> 02:04:54,200
Just run.

2311
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:58,120
Just run till we find food or your health gets better.

2312
02:04:58,580 --> 02:04:59,920
Just keep going, Kiwawa.

2313
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:01,100
Just keep going.

2314
02:05:01,220 --> 02:05:02,340
I don't even know what's over there.

2315
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:03,020
I don't even care.

2316
02:05:03,380 --> 02:05:04,120
We just gotta get out.

2317
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:05,780
No.

2318
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:06,580
No.

2319
02:05:13,930 --> 02:05:14,710
Other way.

2320
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:22,640
I wasn't ready, you guys.

2321
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:23,680
I wasn't ready.

2322
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:29,470
I wasn't ready.

2323
02:05:29,930 --> 02:05:30,690
I wasn't prepared.

2324
02:05:31,190 --> 02:05:32,010
I was a fool.

2325
02:05:32,410 --> 02:05:33,770
OK, our health is getting better though.

2326
02:05:34,810 --> 02:05:36,170
Our health is getting better though.

2327
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:37,130
What the hell are these?

2328
02:05:38,890 --> 02:05:40,890
What the hell are those?

2329
02:05:41,450 --> 02:05:42,350
And dash.

2330
02:05:42,950 --> 02:05:43,230
Nice.

2331
02:05:44,810 --> 02:05:45,590
Oh my god.

2332
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:46,950
No, no, no, no, no, Toho.

2333
02:05:47,310 --> 02:05:48,070
No, Toho.

2334
02:05:49,850 --> 02:05:50,810
No, Toho.

2335
02:05:50,810 --> 02:05:51,650
OK.

2336
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:52,670
Alright.

2337
02:05:53,230 --> 02:05:54,070
We're doing OK.

2338
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:55,150
We're doing alright.

2339
02:05:55,930 --> 02:05:56,470
Oh gosh.

2340
02:06:00,450 --> 02:06:01,070
Cell.

2341
02:06:01,990 --> 02:06:02,710
No, Toho.

2342
02:06:05,590 --> 02:06:06,650
Oh come on.

2343
02:06:10,890 --> 02:06:12,890
What spell card is this?

2344
02:06:17,950 --> 02:06:20,230
Maybe I should have gone with the nightly milk actually.

2345
02:06:20,230 --> 02:06:21,210
Now that I think about it.

2346
02:06:22,010 --> 02:06:22,610
Dang it.

2347
02:06:22,670 --> 02:06:23,350
I went the wrong way.

2348
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:24,990
I tried.

2349
02:06:25,570 --> 02:06:25,890
Oh my god.

2350
02:06:26,010 --> 02:06:26,350
Get me out.

2351
02:06:26,410 --> 02:06:27,490
Get me out.

2352
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:36,500
Maybe we can freeze her.

2353
02:06:38,300 --> 02:06:38,580
OK.

2354
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,720
Oh, I'm not...

2355
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:42,320
I just got this monitor.

2356
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:42,960
I can't.

2357
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:43,740
I can't.

2358
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:44,160
Oh my god.

2359
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:49,800
Actually, swap.

2360
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:51,360
We'll go with more attack.

2361
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:57,060
We'll kill her.

2362
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:57,560
We'll kill her.

2363
02:06:57,820 --> 02:06:58,820
Kill her with kindness.

2364
02:06:59,980 --> 02:07:01,040
And my sword.

2365
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:03,420
Kill, kill.

2366
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:05,640
I mean, we're saving.

2367
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:06,340
We're saving her.

2368
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:07,320
We're saving her, you guys.

2369
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:08,020
Oh, ouch, ouch.

2370
02:07:08,860 --> 02:07:09,740
We're saving her.

2371
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:10,180
Oh my god.

2372
02:07:10,300 --> 02:07:10,960
Oh my god.

2373
02:07:11,860 --> 02:07:12,700
Oh my goodness.

2374
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:15,380
It's these ones that always get me.

2375
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:17,680
If only I could...

2376
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:20,820
If only I could shift and see my hitbox.

2377
02:07:23,260 --> 02:07:24,120
Properly grazed.

2378
02:07:28,720 --> 02:07:29,840
She's still frozen.

2379
02:07:33,140 --> 02:07:33,620
Bolt?

2380
02:07:37,420 --> 02:07:38,640
Oh yeah, I have that.

2381
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:45,840
Maybe I should've saved it.

2382
02:07:46,100 --> 02:07:47,360
But there's all these guys coming in.

2383
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:48,640
It's kind of craziness right now.

2384
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:49,380
Oh god.

2385
02:07:56,360 --> 02:07:57,260
OK, hold on.

2386
02:07:57,580 --> 02:07:58,900
You guys stay away.

2387
02:07:59,180 --> 02:08:00,640
And how about...

2388
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:01,500
I just keep running.

2389
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:02,800
And we'll eventually kill.

2390
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:03,400
Oh my god.

2391
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:07,020
We'll eventually get it.

2392
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:07,360
Right?

2393
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:07,720
Yeah.

2394
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:10,700
Come on!

2395
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:11,880
Come on!

2396
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:17,180
I'm afraid to die in-game.

2397
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:18,040
I'm already dead.

2398
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:20,000
I'm a ghost, but in-game...

2399
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,060
I wanna win!

2400
02:08:26,540 --> 02:08:27,780
Oh my god.

2401
02:08:27,980 --> 02:08:29,440
It's too craziness over there.

2402
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:31,160
I don't even think I'm hitting her.

2403
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:32,180
Because I'm too far away.

2404
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,780
I hit her sometimes.

2405
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:40,720
Why'd you wait your ult to be too bad?

2406
02:08:41,220 --> 02:08:43,000
Because I got nervous.

2407
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:50,640
Let's see.

2408
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:52,140
Let's do Uber Sheep.

2409
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:04,930
I don't know actually about...

2410
02:09:04,930 --> 02:09:06,990
It's too far away from her.

2411
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:12,300
Please!

2412
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:16,840
Well, we're back at the beginning.

2413
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:17,220
Maybe?

2414
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:18,540
Oh my gosh.

2415
02:09:18,740 --> 02:09:19,340
Good.

2416
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:21,660
So many heals.

2417
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:29,420
Uber Sheep.

2418
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:54,120
So close.

2419
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,080
So close.

2420
02:09:58,490 --> 02:09:58,920
NT.

2421
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:02,100
NT, NT.

2422
02:10:02,100 --> 02:10:04,140
Look at the screen though.

2423
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:07,900
The screen is ridiculous.

2424
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:13,080
That's why you fight the boss.

2425
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:17,460
Yeah, that's why you fight the boss instead of running away from the boss.

2426
02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:20,110
How dare you run when you...

2427
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:24,060
Oh, so you wanted me to die faster is what you're saying.

2428
02:10:24,140 --> 02:10:26,320
Because, you know, I wouldn't be able to dodge those.

2429
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:30,100
That's why you, like...

2430
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:30,960
Run.

2431
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:32,420
Instead of...

2432
02:10:32,770 --> 02:10:33,480
I mean, wait.

2433
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:35,920
That's why you fight instead of run.

2434
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:40,700
That's what you sound like right now.

2435
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:46,620
Oh, I got something though.

2436
02:10:47,380 --> 02:10:48,120
Corporation Pin.

2437
02:10:48,260 --> 02:10:54,880
Every 40% of pickup radius also increases attack area of all weapons by 2%.

2438
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:56,500
Nice.

2439
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:56,560
Nice.

2440
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Wawa Super lets you revive while it's active if you die.

2441
02:11:06,620 --> 02:11:07,860
Oh, I didn't know that.

2442
02:11:13,850 --> 02:11:15,070
I don't... Was it charged?

2443
02:11:16,490 --> 02:11:17,330
Like, I don't know.

2444
02:11:17,370 --> 02:11:18,190
I have to look back.

2445
02:11:20,210 --> 02:11:21,290
I'll just be honest.

2446
02:11:21,310 --> 02:11:22,990
I never died as Kiara, so...

2447
02:11:26,310 --> 02:11:29,250
I never died as Kiara, so...

2448
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:37,580
Kiwa was so strong.

2449
02:11:38,380 --> 02:11:39,400
Yeah, I'm just that good.

2450
02:11:40,020 --> 02:11:43,180
I'm sorry you had to know that because you died so many times using her.

2451
02:11:43,420 --> 02:11:47,460
But, for me, that was the first time me dying with Kiara.

2452
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:49,240
Because I'm just that good, you know.

2453
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:58,940
No sense worrying over shoulda, coulda.

2454
02:11:59,000 --> 02:11:59,620
Yeah, exactly.

2455
02:12:00,620 --> 02:12:01,580
I just...

2456
02:12:02,820 --> 02:12:03,840
I just win.

2457
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:05,280
Each time, so...

2458
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,660
I never concern myself with having to revive.

2459
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:11,340
Guys,

2460
02:12:22,870 --> 02:12:23,910
it's a bit of a shorter stream.

2461
02:12:25,010 --> 02:12:28,110
But I think I'm gonna call it there.

2462
02:12:31,190 --> 02:12:34,310
I completed what I was gonna do, which is kind of crazy.

2463
02:12:34,730 --> 02:12:36,750
Actually, before we do that...

2464
02:12:40,510 --> 02:12:41,170
Oh, wait.

2465
02:12:41,550 --> 02:12:42,830
I should have just started at the casino.

2466
02:12:44,650 --> 02:12:51,610
It's so you can fearlessly charge in our amazing, trailblazing Phoenix Oshi Takanashi Kiara.

2467
02:12:51,830 --> 02:12:52,450
Exactly!

2468
02:12:54,670 --> 02:12:55,330
Yeah!

2469
02:12:56,590 --> 02:12:58,430
Let's go gambling.

2470
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:00,910
How

2471
02:13:05,350 --> 02:13:06,710
much money do I have?

2472
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:09,670
Perfect.

2473
02:13:11,530 --> 02:13:13,830
Let's do it all on the slots, baby.

2474
02:13:14,830 --> 02:13:15,750
Slots.

2475
02:13:16,210 --> 02:13:16,630
Spain.

2476
02:13:19,150 --> 02:13:19,910
Win!

2477
02:13:20,610 --> 02:13:23,050
I'm gonna make it big here.

2478
02:13:23,750 --> 02:13:25,910
I'm gonna make it big here.

2479
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:27,550
And I'm gonna...

2480
02:13:27,550 --> 02:13:28,650
Make...

2481
02:13:28,650 --> 02:13:30,050
I'm gonna win jackpot.

2482
02:13:30,430 --> 02:13:31,630
And I'm gonna...

2483
02:13:31,630 --> 02:13:33,830
I'm gonna be able to buy a monkey!

2484
02:13:36,570 --> 02:13:37,330
Win!

2485
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:42,640
It's a win.

2486
02:14:04,270 --> 02:14:05,030
Win!

2487
02:14:05,030 --> 02:14:05,250
Win!

2488
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:11,040
I've basically made my money back at this point, OK?

2489
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:38,100
It's fever time!

2490
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:40,340
Fever time!

2491
02:14:48,610 --> 02:14:49,330
Minigame?

2492
02:14:55,090 --> 02:14:58,780
Oh my god.

2493
02:15:02,620 --> 02:15:04,560
Metal Gear has trained me!

2494
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:10,220
I made my money back!

2495
02:15:14,590 --> 02:15:16,190
I want the monkey.

2496
02:15:16,790 --> 02:15:17,870
I want the monkey!

2497
02:15:18,630 --> 02:15:19,670
Give me the monkey!

2498
02:15:33,700 --> 02:15:36,340
Guys, I'm actually in a profit right now.

2499
02:15:36,580 --> 02:15:38,120
I'm actually in a profit right now.

2500
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:46,600
Show me the monkey.

2501
02:15:47,620 --> 02:15:49,260
I'm like so close to buying him.

2502
02:15:59,290 --> 02:16:01,390
When do I stop playing the game?

2503
02:16:18,150 --> 02:16:23,490
I found some Metal Gear Solid 1999 action figures at my workplace's donation box!

2504
02:16:24,030 --> 02:16:27,310
I just thought of you when I saw them because damn, I didn't think they existed until now.

2505
02:16:27,430 --> 02:16:27,690
Yeah!

2506
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:35,060
We have to win the 777.

2507
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:38,600
That's the big jackpot.

2508
02:16:39,300 --> 02:16:41,620
If I stop playing, does it go away, the jackpot?

2509
02:16:50,950 --> 02:16:51,310
No?

2510
02:16:51,650 --> 02:16:53,010
Oh, so I can come back to it.

2511
02:16:55,670 --> 02:16:58,010
Yeah, I don't have any...

2512
02:16:58,010 --> 02:17:02,890
If they're the atomic violent ones, they're kind of ugly so I don't own any of them.

2513
02:17:05,030 --> 02:17:07,150
But it is fun to see them.

2514
02:17:10,540 --> 02:17:12,180
We'll get the bonus game!

2515
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:22,480
No one stopped before the jackpot.

2516
02:17:23,540 --> 02:17:25,140
Yeah, we have to get the jackpot.

2517
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:26,980
We have to get the jackpot.

2518
02:17:26,980 --> 02:17:28,340
We have to.

2519
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:31,700
I thought you meant Seth MacFarlane.

2520
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:34,220
That's the guy that made...

2521
02:17:34,220 --> 02:17:35,900
This family guy, right?

2522
02:17:38,260 --> 02:17:40,860
Yeah, the Tom MacFarlane games...

2523
02:17:40,860 --> 02:17:45,660
Toys, especially the Metal Gear ones, I see a solid snake and I'm like, who the hell is that?

2524
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:52,160
I was doing so well earlier!

2525
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:57,820
Look guys!

2526
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:01,240
We're making a profit!

2527
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:06,120
It might be hard to see, because you guys are blocking it.

2528
02:18:06,420 --> 02:18:08,260
But we started at 9,000!

2529
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:10,280
I'm at 12,000!

2530
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:17,780
I might be the greatest gambler of all time!

2531
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:19,480
The house hates me!

2532
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:23,460
We're also super brittle and easy to break.

2533
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:27,520
I'm glad I don't own any of them.

2534
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:30,420
Got my solid snake action figure signed at MGSCon.

2535
02:18:30,520 --> 02:18:30,760
Wow!

2536
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:32,540
Metal Gear Solid Fan Convention.

2537
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:36,380
Moving to Ontario Convention Center.

2538
02:18:36,460 --> 02:18:36,920
Who's Kickstarter?

2539
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:37,740
You can support now.

2540
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:38,520
Yes!

2541
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:46,080
And if you support the Kickstarter, there is a stretch goal of having me be one of the hosts.

2542
02:18:46,340 --> 02:18:47,800
That could potentially happen.

2543
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:56,020
And wouldn't it be cool for me to be a part of a Metal Gear thing and I could be like, hey guys...

2544
02:18:58,440 --> 02:19:02,220
I talked to David Hitter and he was like, cool hosting!

2545
02:19:03,700 --> 02:19:04,680
Five hundred!

2546
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:07,840
Win a monkey with this one weird trick.

2547
02:19:08,180 --> 02:19:09,220
The house hates her.

2548
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:12,280
I'm so close to the 7, 7, 7.

2549
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:26,900
My, what's it called, started getting stuck.

2550
02:19:27,740 --> 02:19:28,760
My space bar.

2551
02:19:32,100 --> 02:19:33,120
Guys, 13!

2552
02:19:33,460 --> 02:19:34,060
Holy shit.

2553
02:19:34,060 --> 02:19:35,720
Am I actually...

2554
02:19:36,440 --> 02:19:42,000
I'm not used to this feeling of winning money in the gamble.

2555
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:44,200
Is this actually how...

2556
02:19:44,200 --> 02:19:45,520
Oh, so close!

2557
02:19:45,580 --> 02:19:46,040
Oh my god.

2558
02:19:46,440 --> 02:19:49,140
This is actually how it feels to win the money in the gamble.

2559
02:19:54,340 --> 02:19:58,100
I commented some tips on the last Holocue stream, but it seems like you're doing pretty good.

2560
02:19:58,180 --> 02:19:59,940
Try buying some of the weapon limiters though.

2561
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:00,820
It's good.

2562
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:01,780
You think so?

2563
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:03,440
Also, thanks for the tips!

2564
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:07,920
Use mouse click instead.

2565
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:12,640
Should I just turbo it?

2566
02:20:13,300 --> 02:20:15,260
Should I get my cookie clicker clicker?

2567
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:21,860
Yeah, most people lose in real life gambling.

2568
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:24,280
But guys, we're making a profit here.

2569
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:26,840
The slots might be the way to go.

2570
02:20:38,310 --> 02:20:41,530
I was faster with my keyboard.

2571
02:20:42,670 --> 02:20:45,310
In fact, Amito was trying to buy a fucking monkey.

2572
02:20:49,270 --> 02:20:53,310
Only losers win in real... I mean, lose in real life gambling.

2573
02:20:54,830 --> 02:20:56,950
We're at 15,000!

2574
02:20:58,830 --> 02:21:00,290
How is this possible?

2575
02:21:03,210 --> 02:21:07,390
I've always lost money in any gambling I've done.

2576
02:21:09,570 --> 02:21:10,850
But today...

2577
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:17,480
So if I leave...

2578
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:21,480
And then I do it again...

2579
02:21:22,340 --> 02:21:23,100
Oh, it's still there!

2580
02:21:29,110 --> 02:21:31,290
Auto clickers work fine with this game?

2581
02:21:31,410 --> 02:21:31,930
Let's go.

2582
02:21:32,870 --> 02:21:33,730
Okay, hold on.

2583
02:21:34,230 --> 02:21:36,150
Let's go to some poor sap...

2584
02:21:36,850 --> 02:21:38,270
And rock, paper, scissor them.

2585
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:45,620
Who do you think we should rock, paper, scissor?

2586
02:21:47,420 --> 02:21:48,920
Maybe Callie over here.

2587
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:52,400
While she's distracted with the slots, right?

2588
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:53,420
Wait, can I?

2589
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:54,340
Callie.

2590
02:21:55,780 --> 02:21:57,360
Callie, no, I don't want to do the slots.

2591
02:21:57,520 --> 02:21:58,720
Callie, I want to fight you.

2592
02:22:05,610 --> 02:22:06,270
Come here.

2593
02:22:09,650 --> 02:22:10,070
Please.

2594
02:22:10,830 --> 02:22:11,130
Bay?

2595
02:22:11,350 --> 02:22:12,470
I didn't see her.

2596
02:22:14,610 --> 02:22:15,450
Takamori fight.

2597
02:22:15,650 --> 02:22:16,030
Oh, come here.

2598
02:22:16,730 --> 02:22:17,450
No, no, no.

2599
02:22:17,450 --> 02:22:19,150
No, no, no.

2600
02:22:21,230 --> 02:22:22,550
She's too busy with the slots.

2601
02:22:22,630 --> 02:22:24,190
You guys keep saying Bay, but she's not here.

2602
02:22:27,010 --> 02:22:30,310
You guys are hallucinating.

2603
02:22:31,150 --> 02:22:32,430
You're just like...

2604
02:22:33,390 --> 02:22:33,870
Bay!

2605
02:22:34,450 --> 02:22:35,730
No, she's not here, you guys.

2606
02:22:36,190 --> 02:22:36,870
Take your medicine.

2607
02:22:37,130 --> 02:22:37,890
Take your meds.

2608
02:22:38,570 --> 02:22:39,530
She's not here.

2609
02:22:39,670 --> 02:22:40,750
She's never been here.

2610
02:22:42,010 --> 02:22:42,990
She's not here.

2611
02:22:43,910 --> 02:22:46,390
Let's do... Let's do Ollie.

2612
02:22:47,570 --> 02:22:48,170
Scissor!

2613
02:22:50,730 --> 02:22:51,330
Scissor!

2614
02:22:53,210 --> 02:22:53,810
Rock!

2615
02:22:57,420 --> 02:22:58,680
How much am I betting here?

2616
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:04,920
Wait, how much... How much is she gonna take if I... If I lose?

2617
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:19,680
All of it?

2618
02:23:26,980 --> 02:23:28,160
She only took 200.

2619
02:23:28,300 --> 02:23:30,920
You guys said all, you liars.

2620
02:23:32,140 --> 02:23:34,960
I was ready to lose it all.

2621
02:23:35,380 --> 02:23:36,860
I was ready to lose it all!

2622
02:23:37,180 --> 02:23:38,120
Wait, how much is the monkey?

2623
02:23:42,970 --> 02:23:45,410
I'm ready to buy my monkey now.

2624
02:24:00,940 --> 02:24:02,280
Actually, I kind of want the beetle.

2625
02:24:07,740 --> 02:24:09,600
Wait, you can get trails too!

2626
02:24:10,300 --> 02:24:12,060
The sparkles are so cute!

2627
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:14,240
Okay guys, which trails should we get?

2628
02:24:14,320 --> 02:24:14,820
The hearts?

2629
02:24:15,940 --> 02:24:16,840
The sakura?

2630
02:24:17,220 --> 02:24:18,380
The sparkles?

2631
02:24:18,580 --> 02:24:19,660
The leaves?

2632
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:21,740
Which one?

2633
02:24:21,980 --> 02:24:22,960
Which one should we get?

2634
02:24:23,180 --> 02:24:24,000
Which one should we get?

2635
02:24:28,810 --> 02:24:29,770
Mint leaves?

2636
02:24:29,910 --> 02:24:31,950
I don't think that's what they are.

2637
02:24:34,990 --> 02:24:39,430
I feel like sparkle would be suiting for anybody, you know?

2638
02:24:39,650 --> 02:24:40,090
Sparkle?

2639
02:24:40,190 --> 02:24:40,990
I see a lot of sparkle.

2640
02:24:43,150 --> 02:24:44,190
Bye, bye, bye.

2641
02:24:44,250 --> 02:24:45,370
Hold on, I wanna go see it.

2642
02:24:49,330 --> 02:24:51,150
Okay, I'm just gonna join again.

2643
02:24:53,650 --> 02:24:54,570
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2644
02:24:55,070 --> 02:24:56,530
Oh wait, no, no, no, not the house.

2645
02:24:56,570 --> 02:24:56,950
Not the house.

2646
02:24:57,030 --> 02:24:57,210
Play.

2647
02:24:59,190 --> 02:24:59,510
Oh

2648
02:25:03,370 --> 02:25:04,810
my god, they are so cute!

2649
02:25:05,270 --> 02:25:09,030
Oh wait, she has the trail behind her, so it's kind of...

2650
02:25:09,030 --> 02:25:13,430
It looks like the fire is on... The fire is beautiful!

2651
02:25:13,830 --> 02:25:15,270
We beautified the fire!

2652
02:25:17,390 --> 02:25:20,850
If we had gotten the leaves, they would have just caught it on fire, you know?

2653
02:25:21,590 --> 02:25:22,470
Very cute.

2654
02:25:26,930 --> 02:25:29,630
Alrighty guys, thank you for streaming today.

2655
02:25:30,110 --> 02:25:31,030
I hope you had fun.

2656
02:25:31,710 --> 02:25:34,890
My luck was kind of insane in those first two rounds.

2657
02:25:34,990 --> 02:25:38,050
I can't believe I beat stage 4 and stage 5.

2658
02:25:39,170 --> 02:25:41,090
First try for both of them.

2659
02:25:41,950 --> 02:25:44,650
That's so awesome for us.

2660
02:25:45,070 --> 02:25:48,770
And we were so close to beating stage 2 hard.

2661
02:25:49,790 --> 02:25:50,630
Next time.

2662
02:25:51,590 --> 02:25:52,870
Next time, next time.

2663
02:25:58,800 --> 02:25:59,740
I've cleared all of these.

2664
02:25:59,940 --> 02:26:02,100
Almost all of these with Kimawa now.

2665
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:03,620
A poem with Mata tomorrow?

2666
02:26:03,740 --> 02:26:04,580
I won't!

2667
02:26:08,440 --> 02:26:14,400
If I stream tomorrow, it will be just me probably, but maybe like Matara in the background.

2668
02:26:14,900 --> 02:26:15,620
Or something.

2669
02:26:15,780 --> 02:26:17,480
I don't know quite yet what we're gonna do.

2670
02:26:17,780 --> 02:26:22,220
But I wouldn't... I don't know if we are gonna... Or rather if I am gonna stream just because...

2671
02:26:22,220 --> 02:26:24,220
Like I said, we might go out.

2672
02:26:24,300 --> 02:26:25,720
I might go show her some stuff, you know?

2673
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:36,600
Like, show her around the maid cafe and the area and, you know, stuff before things are closed for Thanksgiving.

2674
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:39,120
So yeah.

2675
02:26:39,500 --> 02:26:42,720
But we do have an off collab on Friday, so...

2676
02:26:43,740 --> 02:26:44,220
Yeah, yeah.

2677
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:48,540
We do have an off collab on Friday, so you will... You can watch that.

2678
02:26:50,480 --> 02:26:51,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2679
02:26:52,020 --> 02:26:53,020
Excited for P.T.

2680
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:53,540
Stop!

2681
02:26:54,100 --> 02:26:55,320
Oh my gosh, I'm so mad.

2682
02:26:56,180 --> 02:26:57,140
I'm so mad.

2683
02:26:57,240 --> 02:26:58,900
I was just like...

2684
02:26:58,900 --> 02:27:01,280
On our off collab, I kind of want Matara to play P.T.

2685
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:02,600
except she plays this time.

2686
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:04,400
I'm gonna talk to her about it.

2687
02:27:04,540 --> 02:27:10,440
Because she originally wanted to do... Or rather she talked about wanting to do the patchy slot, but...

2688
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:13,840
It will be spoilers for her and I don't want her to see anything.

2689
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:16,720
So I was just like... I'm gonna make her play P.T.

2690
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:21,760
Because she... Because she has always wanted to play P.T.

2691
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:26,180
And so I was like, well, I have it.

2692
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:27,420
And so she could play it.

2693
02:27:27,820 --> 02:27:30,720
And then... And then...

2694
02:27:32,460 --> 02:27:36,980
You guys have to go and guess all my plans.

2695
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:39,900
Why are you mad?

2696
02:27:43,140 --> 02:27:44,260
I... I...

2697
02:27:57,820 --> 02:27:58,800
I'm getting rid of the music.

2698
02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:00,720
It makes me sound too happy.

2699
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:02,020
No!

2700
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:05,760
Do you see the anger in my eyes?

2701
02:28:06,680 --> 02:28:08,860
Stop spoiling my plans!

2702
02:28:09,620 --> 02:28:10,320
Stop!

2703
02:28:10,760 --> 02:28:12,560
Let me... Let me have fun!

2704
02:28:13,820 --> 02:28:15,620
Let me plan things.

2705
02:28:15,880 --> 02:28:18,120
Let me plan things for you guys.

2706
02:28:18,400 --> 02:28:24,140
And let me be able to carry them out without you spoiling them for yourselves!

2707
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:46,840
I'm gonna go now.

2708
02:28:47,260 --> 02:28:50,660
And I'm gonna go eat jelly to feel better.

2709
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:51,760
Otsumito!

2710
02:28:54,100 --> 02:28:55,360
OK, I'm over it.

2711
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:56,200
Otsumito!

2712
02:28:56,780 --> 02:28:57,540
Bye bye!

2713
02:28:58,780 --> 02:29:00,300
Have you considered being less predictable?

2714
02:29:00,740 --> 02:29:02,720
I hate you!
