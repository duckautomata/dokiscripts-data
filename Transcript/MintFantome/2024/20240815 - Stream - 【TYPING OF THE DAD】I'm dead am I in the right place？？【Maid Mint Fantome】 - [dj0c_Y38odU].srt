1
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,660
Hello, can you hear me?

2
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,920
Hello, howdy?

3
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,840
Are we okay?

4
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,880
I haven't talked today, so my voice is a little... I think... still sleepy voice.

5
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,740
Sleepy voice.

6
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,210
Good to see you.

7
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,250
Good to see you!

8
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,290
Welcome to the typing of the dead!

9
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,070
Overkill!

10
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,630
Are these songs the DMCN?

11
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,750
I hope not.

12
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,910
Also, I feel like I'm a little big.

13
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,070
House of the dead.

14
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,210
Overkill.

15
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,390
House of the dead?

16
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,710
It's fucking delicious!

17
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,130
No, no, this is typing of the dead, not house of the dead.

18
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,830
Critics said it's fucking good.

19
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,070
I am critics.

20
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:52,930
Maybe.

21
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:55,950
Sir,

22
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,190
your language!

23
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,030
YouTube's gonna get mad at me!

24
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,850
Prostitutes said I would suck that guy's dick.

25
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,250
Sir!

26
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,740
He's taking over my stream!

27
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,380
A ruthless crack whore said, give me a chicken dinner.

28
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,420
What?

29
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,040
What's happening?

30
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,200
What's happening?

31
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,160
What did he say, actually?

32
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,220
House of the dead.

33
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,340
Overkill.

34
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,300
Fucked up demons.

35
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,600
I'm playing typing of the dead for the first time ever.

36
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,860
I'm playing for the first time ever.

37
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,200
I just kinda wanted to do a typing game.

38
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,340
So here I am.

39
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,600
Oh my god!

40
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,260
Thanks Merlin!

41
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,100
It's covering my face though.

42
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,200
Why do you keep saying House of the Dead?

43
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,480
I know there's a House of the Dead right here.

44
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,280
Thank you!

45
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,780
I eat your... gifted.

46
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,700
Thanks Spank!

47
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,740
Thanks for the Tony!

48
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,620
I eat your doughnut.

49
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,420
Do you remember what your WPM is?

50
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,580
I think it was like 90 something.

51
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,220
I don't remember.

52
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:33,980
Andreas!

53
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,920
Thanks for the Tony gifted!

54
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,140
Oh wait.

55
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,400
I gotta wait for it to come up.

56
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,480
I'm waiting.

57
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,840
I'm waiting.

58
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,480
I'm waiting.

59
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,790
How does Mito type with her sleeves like that?

60
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,210
What are you talking about?

61
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,090
He's back.

62
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,070
Basically... wait.

63
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,930
Basically just an official mod arranged version of the House of the Dead.

64
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,210
Oh!

65
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,170
I used to play House of the Dead in the arcade so much.

66
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,050
Okay this guy.

67
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,210
This guy.

68
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,330
So I guess we just do story mode right?

69
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,990
Other critics said it's motherfucking good.

70
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,730
Can you let me speak please?

71
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,150
Casey thanks for the gifted.

72
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,530
A three corner prostitute says I would suck that guy up dead.

73
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:23,810
Stop!

74
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,490
We're gonna go to story mode.

75
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,970
Story mode.

76
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,490
I ain't no bitch!

77
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,090
A toothless crack horse.

78
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,350
I'm an MF-er!

79
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,490
Give me a chicken dinner.

80
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,730
I'm a mint phantom-er!

81
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,510
I'm an MF-er!

82
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:49,580
I'm an MF-er!

83
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,400
Should I try this one?

84
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,860
Is it very difficult?

85
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,500
Should I be MF-er?

86
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,340
Actually hold on.

87
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,760
Let me make sure I can put my...

88
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,980
Okay I gotta move my mic over a little bit.

89
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,740
So I can reach my keyboard properly.

90
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,700
Longer words!

91
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,700
Let's try it!

92
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,900
Okay this is putting my true OL-ness to the test.

93
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,300
Let's try it.

94
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,740
Intermission?

95
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,380
Okay let's play the game baby!

96
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,640
Watch Grindhouse if I like this game.

97
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,480
What's up motherfucker?

98
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,420
Tatsumi!

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,120
We met as adversaries.

100
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,920
What the fuck was that for?

101
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,380
A monster made them allies.

102
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,760
A secret agent.

103
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,880
Immaculate.

104
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,000
Intelligent.

105
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,200
A rookie.

106
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,240
He's got the rookie's eyes.

107
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,420
They call him Only G.

108
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,840
How's the audio by the way?

109
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,240
His identity?

110
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,020
A mystery.

111
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,340
Only G?

112
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,500
You ever gonna tell anyone what that fucking G stands for?

113
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,880
No.

114
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,040
A playboy cop.

115
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,220
Isaac Washington.

116
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:57,800
No.

117
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,460
Make him mad and he'll rip your balls off.

118
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,600
Not the license plate!

119
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,520
I'm gonna rip your motherfucking balls off!

120
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:13,850
Night.

121
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,830
These unlikely allies will confront terror most foul.

122
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,710
In the blood so tall.

123
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,630
This game is awesome!

124
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,330
Papa's palace of pain.

125
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,750
Be a courteous guest.

126
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,750
By tomorrow morning I'll have my motherfucking revenge.

127
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,510
Papa Caesar will be dead.

128
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,570
This game is so awesome!

129
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,450
If we don't stop this mutant outbreak by tomorrow morning we'll all be dead.

130
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,810
Wait have I been streaming for...

131
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,170
Okay a couple minutes we're good.

132
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,410
This will be your last.

133
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,610
Papa's palace of pain.

134
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,050
PPP.

135
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,190
Rated X.

136
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,650
Not for children.

137
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,310
Every kid get out of here.

138
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,330
The grown ups are playing now.

139
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,310
Oh!

140
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,370
Brains!

141
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,450
Okay.

142
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,010
Alright.

143
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,510
Nice.

144
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,190
Press tab to...

145
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,470
Okay.

146
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,050
Alright.

147
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,410
Alright.

148
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,130
How do I tab?

149
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,630
There we go.

150
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,150
Oh.

151
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,410
What does this mean?

152
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,110
Exult.

153
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,110
Okay.

154
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,190
Mega Man X.

155
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,010
Nice.

156
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,510
Oh.

157
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,650
Okay.

158
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,470
This is not proof.

159
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,550
Oh my lover!

160
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,090
My lover baby.

161
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,150
Liver.

162
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,370
Ah!

163
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,450
Infected!

164
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:37,970
Quick!

165
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,570
Oh my god.

166
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:40,970
Opaque.

167
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,070
I never use...

168
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,710
Gutter.

169
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:43,570
Oh.

170
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,510
Meat bag.

171
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,030
I have to do the capitals too, right?

172
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,770
Is that what makes it more difficult?

173
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,390
Oh.

174
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:51,670
Oh.

175
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,190
Oh.

176
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,710
Oh my god.

177
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,950
Come down.

178
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,950
Come down.

179
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,170
Cut him down.

180
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,350
Oh.

181
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,230
We're gaming you guys.

182
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,770
We're gaming.

183
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,630
We're gaming.

184
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,490
Don't be long.

185
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:03,950
Oh.

186
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,890
We got him.

187
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,530
Oh my god.

188
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,970
Oh my god.

189
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,670
I got an achievement.

190
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,510
A Gorgasm.

191
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,010
Oh my god.

192
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,010
Obscene.

193
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,890
I don't know how to spell.

194
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,170
It's not just...

195
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,370
It's not just...

196
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,990
It's not just typing.

197
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:28,270
Oh.

198
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,790
Hush.

199
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,090
They're sleeping.

200
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,350
It's not just typing.

201
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,350
It's knowing how to spell too.

202
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,470
Oh god.

203
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,130
Oh.

204
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:39,870
Oh.

205
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,970
Library car.

206
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:42,930
Oh.

207
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,090
Oh.

208
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,250
Backspace.

209
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:45,690
Oh.

210
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:48,810
Wait.

211
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,630
I couldn't read that.

212
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,130
I was typing.

213
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,910
Elementary my dear.

214
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,230
Up and down.

215
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,790
Okay.

216
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,550
Hush.

217
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:55,950
Hush.

218
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:56,250
Hush.

219
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,470
Hush.

220
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,810
Perfect grammar game.

221
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,230
I know.

222
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,690
Chemical reaction maybe.

223
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:01,930
O.

224
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:02,130
C.

225
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:02,690
L.

226
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,010
R.

227
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,610
X.

228
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:03,930
U.

229
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,430
Easy.

230
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,370
Game debuted on the Wii?

231
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,790
How is that possible?

232
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,070
Um.

233
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,290
Hello.

234
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:10,890
I'm already done.

235
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,610
Don't like Monday.

236
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,970
Oh.

237
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,030
Dry your eyes.

238
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:17,750
Ha.

239
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,110
Ha.

240
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,470
Got the munchies.

241
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,110
Spell mint.

242
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,030
Not sick.

243
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,150
Just coughing.

244
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:25,970
Hup.

245
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,530
Hup.

246
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,450
Hup.

247
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,250
Hup.

248
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,570
Oh.

249
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,290
Your dad.

250
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,210
Berkshire hut.

251
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,970
Skill shot.

252
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,890
Or attempt at flattery.

253
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,050
Your dad.

254
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,370
Oh my god.

255
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,490
Man slaughter of crows.

256
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:43,590
Man slaughter of crows.

257
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,070
It's literally typing of the dad.

258
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:47,950
Crappy birthday.

259
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:48,470
Oh.

260
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,910
I'm sorry.

261
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,490
Big drum.

262
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,570
Quadruple double.

263
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,190
The mace.

264
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,170
I don't want it.

265
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:57,490
Okay.

266
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,050
Get out of here.

267
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,510
Oh.

268
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,550
Get out of here.

269
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,570
I'm scared you guys.

270
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:00,930
I'm scared.

271
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,090
A crud.

272
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:02,910
Slice.

273
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:03,930
Filthy.

274
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:04,690
Rank.

275
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,130
Where are my feet?

276
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,710
Haha.

277
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,030
Dead.

278
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,990
Maintain a gorgasm for two minutes.

279
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,550
You guys.

280
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,290
I'm...

281
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,390
Gorgasming.

282
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,670
Last rise.

283
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,270
Napoleon ate the pig.

284
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,550
Is my health okay?

285
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,170
Where is everyone else?

286
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,830
Pitch perfect.

287
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,810
Go Curly.

288
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,190
Flippers.

289
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,090
Addressed by your moment.

290
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,290
Batting collapse.

291
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,130
Is my health okay?

292
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:42,690
I can't tell.

293
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,970
Go Curly.

294
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,410
Science fiction.

295
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,270
Wait.

296
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:48,590
Tap.

297
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,030
Oh.

298
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,990
Odds or evens.

299
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,490
Oh my god.

300
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,770
Bat of rancid cheese.

301
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:55,930
No damage?

302
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,290
Oh.

303
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,430
How can you tell?

304
00:12:59,650 --> 00:12:59,970
Oh.

305
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,630
But my character is like red in the corner.

306
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,470
Oh my god.

307
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,230
Exit.

308
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,290
Stage left.

309
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,730
Up past the mud.

310
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,270
Please.

311
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,970
Thank you.

312
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,190
Sticky fingers.

313
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,250
Oh.

314
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,410
Hold your fire.

315
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,030
Pizza.

316
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,190
Are

317
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,020
you gonna kiss me?

318
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,540
Or what?

319
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,200
Oh.

320
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,000
Head.

321
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,740
Shit man.

322
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,760
That ain't right.

323
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,520
That ain't right.

324
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,180
Pizza.

325
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,180
Pizza saved the civilian.

326
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,660
Hello?

327
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,890
Hold your fire.

328
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,270
Pizza.

329
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:52,950
Hold your fire.

330
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,880
I got them.

331
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,620
I saved them probably.

332
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,240
Yeah.

333
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,760
We're good.

334
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,700
Almost free.

335
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,400
That's hard to say.

336
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:08,920
Oh.

337
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,720
Drowning.

338
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,060
Possibly problematic.

339
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,260
Okay.

340
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,600
Um.

341
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,540
Stop shooting.

342
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,180
Nope.

343
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,360
Hidden depths.

344
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,740
Shit.

345
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,220
I fucking hate these zombies.

346
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,540
Mutants.

347
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,120
Mutants.

348
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,920
How many times do I have to tell you not to use the Z word?

349
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:25,680
Tate.

350
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:25,960
Wait.

351
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,020
Unpro.

352
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,420
Oh.

353
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,760
Unprovoked.

354
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:30,820
Assault.

355
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,300
Oh.

356
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:33,780
Flooding.

357
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,420
Destructible crate.

358
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,080
Oh my god.

359
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,680
That was close.

360
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:37,980
Oh.

361
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,360
Stomach ache.

362
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,700
Tommy heart.

363
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,760
Flip the.

364
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,560
The bird.

365
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,320
Oh.

366
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,760
Stack the deck.

367
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,960
A vibrating peripheral.

368
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,580
These are hard words.

369
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,040
Oh my god.

370
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,480
I'm stressed.

371
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,400
A melon fiber.

372
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,800
Fizzy.

373
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:56,940
Make.

374
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,420
Me.

375
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:57,940
Feel.

376
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,320
Good.

377
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,960
I actually just typed me.

378
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,480
A melon fiber.

379
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,320
To hell going.

380
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,440
Shut up and press the button.

381
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,100
Press the button.

382
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:06,920
Oof.

383
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,180
What kind of bird?

384
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:09,860
Um.

385
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,780
A shoebill.

386
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,140
Tommy heart.

387
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,080
Oh.

388
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,340
We should have taken the stairs.

389
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,980
This ghost got head.

390
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,460
Washington.

391
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,580
You okay?

392
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,380
No.

393
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,900
I am not okay.

394
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:25,860
Asshole.

395
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,920
Shake it off detective.

396
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,880
Come on.

397
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,600
Let's move.

398
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,640
You don't have to be rude about it.

399
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,480
Oh.

400
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,020
I would play the heck out of this as a kid.

401
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,100
To learn how to type.

402
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,440
I'm not saying I did.

403
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,680
I'm saying I would if I had it.

404
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,120
You know?

405
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,920
Why are we going in here?

406
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,040
Oh.

407
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,220
I have a.

408
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh.

409
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,340
Okay.

410
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,480
I definitely read that wrong.

411
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,600
Room.

412
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,200
Serve.

413
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:55,680
Oh god.

414
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,360
Can't.

415
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:56,880
Do.

416
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,340
Stay.

417
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:57,780
Oh no.

418
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,480
I lost the health.

419
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:58,980
Oh my god.

420
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,300
Damned if you don't.

421
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,480
Oh.

422
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,080
Bad.

423
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,420
At.

424
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,220
Hards.

425
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,640
Oh shoot.

426
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,420
Button up.

427
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,460
Please use a mirror.

428
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,480
It's hard sometimes.

429
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,540
I just type what I.

430
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,200
What I.

431
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,680
Type.

432
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,600
What I see first.

433
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,660
Rather than.

434
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,660
Who taught these guys table manners?

435
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,120
Rather than.

436
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,260
What's coming at me first?

437
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,200
These guys ain't human.

438
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,440
Walrus badge.

439
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,920
I've never seen this kind of crazy shit before.

440
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,540
All right.

441
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,320
So what's the game plan?

442
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:28,960
What are they making?

443
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,260
You restrain the subject.

444
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,800
And I'll lead an interrogation.

445
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:31,980
Wait.

446
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,380
What are we taught?

447
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:32,980
Up that column.

448
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,080
Up that column.

449
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,860
Columbo.

450
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,240
Shoot to me.

451
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,500
Oh my god.

452
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,700
Oh my god.

453
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,800
Oh.

454
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,840
Sex repellent.

455
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,520
Oh my god.

456
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,060
This is hard.

457
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,340
Ham toucher.

458
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,540
Columbo Mansion.

459
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,580
Let's go baby.

460
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,760
Oh.

461
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:54,700
Uh.

462
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,400
Okay.

463
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,240
Donut.

464
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,880
Consume donut.

465
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,660
Over there.

466
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,400
Thank you.

467
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,660
Pastrami.

468
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,220
Oh no.

469
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,180
I killed him.

470
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,500
I killed him.

471
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:04,520
I killed him.

472
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,360
I killed him.

473
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:05,380
I killed him.

474
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,460
Guys.

475
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,220
I thought I was gaming.

476
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:07,980
Um.

477
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,560
Don't worry about him though.

478
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,800
I thought we saved him.

479
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,520
A sadistic crime lord.

480
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,640
Master of a perverse science.

481
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,380
I thought I got the right one.

482
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,700
My darling Jasper.

483
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,140
Do you have a present for me?

484
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,960
They call him Caesar.

485
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,100
Papa Caesar.

486
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,000
A test subject at the hospital.

487
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,940
A show in progress.

488
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,320
You've done very well my boy.

489
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,360
We shall celebrate your success.

490
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,560
I'll take this tonight with take out, Chinese.

491
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,620
Oh nice.

492
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,780
A brilliant mind with a broken body.

493
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,420
You've gone too far Papa Caesar.

494
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,460
His talents turn to evil to protect the sister who raised him.

495
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,520
No he's Papa Caesar not Papa John's.

496
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,360
Oh my god.

497
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,620
Think of your sister before threatening Papa Caesar.

498
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,640
Papa Caesar.

499
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,160
Next time you speak.

500
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,020
Turn the volume to zero.

501
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,380
Fucking cabbage.

502
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,520
Nobody threatens Varla.

503
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,900
What the?

504
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,900
The ultimate sacrifice.

505
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,200
Oh my god.

506
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,720
What's happening?

507
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Freeze bitches.

508
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,980
Because of the shocking nature of the following scenes.

509
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,960
They are definitely not recommended for the squeamish or the easily offended.

510
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,420
Are you guys easily offended?

511
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,340
Or squeamish?

512
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,820
What is?

513
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,500
Oh my god.

514
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,520
Oh no.

515
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,680
Oh ew.

516
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,860
What the?

517
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,540
Oh my god.

518
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,780
Who is?

519
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,160
I feel tall.

520
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,780
Call it a draw.

521
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,640
What?

522
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,340
Free at last.

523
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,320
Good evening.

524
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,100
Oh shit.

525
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,020
P. Oh my god.

526
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,380
X.

527
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:53,980
X.

528
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,320
Man.

529
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:54,880
X.

530
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,900
F.

531
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,700
Stupid stairs.

532
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,900
B.

533
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,980
Want to be loved.

534
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,500
B.

535
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:03,940
Oh.

536
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,740
A bit.

537
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:04,960
Shit.

538
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,140
Oh.

539
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,320
H.

540
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,220
I like cabbage.

541
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,640
He's mind touching me.

542
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,380
Oh my god.

543
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,120
He's mind touching me.

544
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,340
Move zig.

545
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,700
Kind of like it though.

546
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,340
You're not so fucking clever now, are you, bitch?

547
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,920
Cute and yellow.

548
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,580
It.

549
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,460
Okay.

550
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,160
Oh.

551
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,380
Oh.

552
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,680
He's gross.

553
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,240
His fingers.

554
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,780
Oh.

555
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,040
He's nasty.

556
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,120
Oh.

557
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,540
Mame.

558
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,340
Nice.

559
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,380
Mame.

560
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,500
He's giving, um, Psycho Mantis.

561
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,400
Jump.

562
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,120
Oh.

563
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,460
Oh.

564
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:49,760
Shoot.

565
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,040
I pressed tab for that.

566
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,880
Whatever it is, just shoot it.

567
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,260
Oh my god.

568
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:56,840
Oh my god.

569
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,240
Oh my god.

570
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,520
Oh my god.

571
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:57,740
Oh my god.

572
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,100
Back.

573
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,060
Live.

574
00:19:59,420 --> 00:19:59,900
Vlog.

575
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,000
Not so fucking clever now, are you, bitch?

576
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,040
Oh.

577
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,300
Your face are being locked out.

578
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,460
My brain is beautiful.

579
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:07,940
Quick.

580
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,020
Shoot him.

581
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,640
I'm not even a mutant.

582
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,660
One.

583
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,000
Two.

584
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,040
I'm not even a mutant.

585
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,200
My palace of pain.

586
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,300
Oh.

587
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,700
Shit.

588
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,680
W.

589
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,120
Oh.

590
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,360
Shoot.

591
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:20,660
Ow.

592
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,020
Ow.

593
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,240
Ow.

594
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,420
Ow.

595
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,580
Ow.

596
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:21,680
Ow.

597
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,200
Ow.

598
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,220
Ow.

599
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,260
Ow.

600
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,160
Ow.

601
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:26,700
Ow.

602
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,500
Ow.

603
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,320
Ow.

604
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,160
Shit.

605
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,700
Take him out.

606
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,360
Take him out.

607
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,800
I can help you with the pain.

608
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,160
Yeah.

609
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,020
No, you can fucking not.

610
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,240
Shoot the motherfucker.

611
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,560
Don't you do tact.

612
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,400
That's what I am going to fucking do.

613
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,320
Yeah, but you stopped him.

614
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,600
You know, shut the fuck up and shoot.

615
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,080
Shit.

616
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,100
Stop.

617
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,040
You stopped.

618
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,360
Oh.

619
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,260
Happy now?

620
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,440
Fuckwit.

621
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,860
You fucking bastards.

622
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,180
You killed my brother.

623
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,000
You're his sister?

624
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,660
Oh my god.

625
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,680
You're his sister?

626
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,880
You're his sister?

627
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:14,920
Oh.

628
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:15,960
Guns.

629
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,440
A doting sibling to a crippled brother.

630
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,800
Forced into a life of vice.

631
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,760
Now she's filled with a primal hunger for revenge.

632
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
Oh, his sister.

633
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,120
Mankind's last hope now rests on the shoulders of two men.

634
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,060
Caesar's heading to the hospital.

635
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,580
We got to stop that asshole before he gets there.

636
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,640
Tasteful ride.

637
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,980
Don't disrespect my wheels.

638
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,600
She's my pride and joy.

639
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,560
Oh, I want to see the ride.

640
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,420
Oh.

641
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:41,940
Oh.

642
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,320
Oh.

643
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:42,900
Oh.

644
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,720
Oh, the ride.

645
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,260
We'll take my car.

646
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:54,980
The plantation house has claimed its victims, but with Papa Caesar on the loose, nobody is safe.

647
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,900
Oh, sister.

648
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,000
You died trying to stop Caesar.

649
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,920
I won't rest until I've shot his fucking guts over half the county.

650
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,640
Yeah, you talk, Miss Gun- oh, there she goes.

651
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,210
Complete Papa's Palace of Pain.

652
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,490
Oh, my accuracy was 90.

653
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:15,570
Oh, my accuracy was 90.

654
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,430
97%.

655
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,030
Dang.

656
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,370
I got a gorgasm for 254 seconds.

657
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,030
Almost 255.

658
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,790
He got A rank.

659
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,510
Yeah, baby.

660
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,790
Don't look at this part, though.

661
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,990
Don't look at this part.

662
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:34,910
Comics found.

663
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,210
Okay, I forget how to...

664
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,250
Posters found.

665
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,010
Records found.

666
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,930
How do I find those?

667
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:41,970
I saw some...

668
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,070
I have to press tap...

669
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,430
Oh, no, wait.

670
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,230
What was the button that I pressed?

671
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:45,550
Oh, I forgot.

672
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,330
Oh, my gosh.

673
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,790
S17.

674
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,110
Thank you for the 50 gifted.

675
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,890
Thank you.

676
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,230
Thank you.

677
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:51,590
Thank you.

678
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,570
Oh, just tab, right?

679
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,270
Okay, tab.

680
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,690
I saw things glowing.

681
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,010
I think it was also health.

682
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,450
Okay, tab.

683
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:04,530
Okay.

684
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,570
Just spam tab when you're not shooting?

685
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,010
Okay.

686
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,310
Okay.

687
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:07,590
Okay.

688
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,450
Good to know.

689
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,950
Good to know.

690
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,250
Nice.

691
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:12,890
This is fun.

692
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,230
Those LOL skills paying off.

693
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:15,530
Come on.

694
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:17,570
Wait.

695
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:18,770
Wait.

696
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,310
Am I going to be okay with this?

697
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,990
Wait.

698
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,710
Is YouTube going to be angry at me?

699
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,570
Wait.

700
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,030
Wait.

701
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,570
Wait.

702
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,870
Wait.

703
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,870
I thought we were going to the hospital.

704
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,550
Wait.

705
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:33,750
Wait.

706
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:33,970
Wait.

707
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,230
Wait.

708
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,310
Wait.

709
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,390
Wait.

710
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,230
Wait.

711
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,550
Wait.

712
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,330
Wait.

713
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,230
Wait.

714
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,590
So long, baby.

715
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:48,810
So long, baby.

716
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:48,870
So long, baby.

717
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,650
So long, baby.

718
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:49,910
So long, baby.

719
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,990
I mean, I'm fine with it.

720
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,310
It's really just, you know...

721
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,010
YouTube is the one who gets...

722
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,270
Oh, see.

723
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,890
It's Pussycat.

724
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,270
She's not...

725
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,430
She's not in his chair.

726
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,150
A voluptuous vixen, vowing violent vengeance.

727
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,770
Papa Caesar, you better pray those fucking pigs catch up with you before I do.

728
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,850
What?

729
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,410
Oh, my God.

730
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,530
Oh, my God.

731
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,490
No nudity in this level?

732
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,110
In this one?

733
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,770
Okay.

734
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,150
She took his chair.

735
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:21,530
Oh.

736
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,810
Let's go.

737
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,850
Oh, my God.

738
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,870
Jiggle physics.

739
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,110
Is it going to explode?

740
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:26,750
Okay.

741
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,850
I was hoping.

742
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,990
Candy Striper.

743
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,910
Candy Striper?

744
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,530
Just your average girl next door.

745
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:41,130
But behind her wholesome image lies a dark secret.

746
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,750
What's that?

747
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:42,750
Hi, Jasper.

748
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,510
My special little chair baby.

749
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,170
Oh, no.

750
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,450
One day, we'll be free of this hellhole.

751
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,310
She was in love with him.

752
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:58,150
Forced to degrade herself night after night for cheap thrills and a handful of dollar bills.

753
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,870
Your brother!

754
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,280
You're just getting the guns ready.

755
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,120
Wait.

756
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,520
Does she know?

757
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,180
Does the other girl know?

758
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,060
Does Candy know?

759
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,180
I swear, Caesar.

760
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,320
I'm going to shove this gun so far down your side, you're going to have to burp.

761
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,340
Oh my god, she's awesome.

762
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,740
Oh!

763
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,200
Ah!

764
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,920
Viola.

765
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,840
His car.

766
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,060
Damn.

767
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:48,680
Oh no.

768
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,700
His car.

769
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,540
I know.

770
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,040
Oh my god, no.

771
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,820
Stairlift.

772
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,080
This dialogue is insane.

773
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,720
No!

774
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,440
No!

775
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,740
I'm sorry.

776
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,580
This acting is grade A.

777
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,580
Oh my god, how romantic.

778
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,180
Where are the mirrors?

779
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,440
Anything else I should know?

780
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,860
Just that.

781
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,860
Oh my god!

782
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,620
Sorry.

783
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,300
I said there's a zombie invasion.

784
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,720
Never mind.

785
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:12,780
Get ready to be titillated, tantalized, and teased by tasseled titty temptresses.

786
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,140
But beware, these kittens have claws.

787
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,420
Witness naked desire, naked lust, naked terror.

788
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,600
Keep both hands on the controller.

789
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,480
My hands are on the...

790
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,460
How do you type in the weed?

791
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,820
How did you do that?

792
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,440
Naked snake.

793
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,360
Here we go.

794
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,120
Oh, frost.

795
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,260
Artists only backstage.

796
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,940
And strippers.

797
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,260
Get out of here.

798
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,760
And strippers, baby.

799
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,520
My lovely lady lumps, we are...

800
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:50,900
Shit.

801
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,300
I got the wrong guy.

802
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,760
Here we go.

803
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,200
Right.

804
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,400
I think I'm the only one who knew all of this.

805
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,740
No one knows.

806
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,400
It's the best.

807
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,460
I think I'm the only one.

808
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,260
What's this?

809
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,140
It's a...

810
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,140
I don't know what it is, but I don't know what it is.

811
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,260
Time.

812
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,000
Time, time, time, time, time...

813
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,100
Butterfly, shit!

814
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,340
What the...

815
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,360
Oh my god.

816
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,400
I got the wrong word.

817
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,220
Space, maybe?

818
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,040
I don't know.

819
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:42,360
Ew.

820
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,100
Was your hands.

821
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:44,680
Ew!

822
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,760
Reported you for spam.

823
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,180
Oh, I got it!

824
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,180
Sova-doodles!

825
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,760
A philosophical zombie gun in your pocket?

826
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,600
Are you just happy to see me?

827
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,380
I'm tapping, I'm tapping, I'm tapping.

828
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,800
Nice.

829
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,460
What kind of asshole locks a fire exit?

830
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,580
I don't think that's legal.

831
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,060
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god...

832
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,920
We got him.

833
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,680
Here, baby!

834
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,820
I'm tapping, I'm tapping.

835
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,040
Oh!

836
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,260
Stroke!

837
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,000
One!

838
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,890
Looks like it's business as usual out here.

839
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:42,550
Another bunch of creeps pawing at your body and tipping badly.

840
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,110
Oh my god.

841
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,050
Sorry, that guy freaked me.

842
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,710
This crazy world!

843
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,650
Don't hit me.

844
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,050
A Q and R!

845
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,970
They're ready for a show, baby.

846
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,110
Let's give them one.

847
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:02,070
Oh and...

848
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:02,590
Slippers.

849
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,030
Ah!

850
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,070
That's my stage, bitch!

851
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,250
You tell her.

852
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,530
Uh, Q-tips.

853
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,050
Psychotic!

854
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:17,730
Psychotic?

855
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,140
Cat fight, baby!

856
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,700
What?

857
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,120
Are you kidding me?

858
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,640
This doesn't count as a fucking emergency.

859
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,780
Oh my god.

860
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,700
Oh shit.

861
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,740
Tea cakes, shit.

862
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,760
I did the wrong one.

863
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,900
I did the wrong one.

864
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,520
No!

865
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,060
Oh!

866
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,460
Tabtab-tab-tab-tab-tab-tab-tab?

867
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,480
Tabición-tab replacement?

868
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,020
J hay que hacer una torre batidora?

869
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,400
Tab-tab-tab-tab-tab-tab-tab-tab-tab?

870
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:41,840
T.

871
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,400
S.

872
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:42,840
T.

873
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,700
Tab-tab-tab-tab-tab-tab-tab-tab.

874
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,640
O و E.

875
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,000
Tam-tab-tab.

876
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,720
Oh, look at them go!

877
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,560
Oh.

878
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,560
Oh my god.

879
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,240
Oh god.

880
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:52,900
Oh no!

881
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,120
Shit!

882
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,230
Pirates.

883
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,010
Turn in this thing.

884
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:01,190
Oh my god.

885
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,130
Down with this sort of thing.

886
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:04,590
Umm...

887
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,790
Umm...

888
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,230
Up, up and away!

889
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,270
Damn.

890
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,390
Take control of your place.

891
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,230
Oh well!

892
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:23,930
That's me!

893
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,610
Parkour, baby.

894
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,590
Our girl's hot and flexible.

895
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,350
What

896
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,280
the hell is this?

897
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,820
What the hell is a Triska 5 doing?

898
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,480
Oh, dang it, I missed it.

899
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,260
What am I typing?

900
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,040
What the hell did I just type?

901
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,380
Looks like closing time on a Saturday night out here.

902
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,800
Closing time...

903
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,500
There we go.

904
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,340
That was close.

905
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,380
That was so close.

906
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,160
Tab.

907
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,700
Clouds.

908
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,720
Ordinary.

909
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:33,780
Ordinary!

910
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,360
Genius!

911
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:35,900
Dang it.

912
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,720
Tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab.

913
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,620
I don't even know what this is!

914
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,800
Whiskey Sour!

915
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,860
Tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab.

916
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,160
Very explained fresh.

917
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,960
Should I do this?

918
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,580
Hey!

919
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,460
Watch where you're throwing that thing!

920
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,700
Oh my god!

921
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:03,900
Eh!

922
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:06,820
Gosh!

923
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,560
That could have had someone's eye out.

924
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:09,980
Yeah!

925
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:10,760
Oh!

926
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,020
P!

927
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,360
K!

928
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:11,700
Z!

929
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:11,940
Oh!

930
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,640
Dang it.

931
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,160
Learning so many new words.

932
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,320
Risky cake robot.

933
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,420
I almost wrote freaky out of habit.

934
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:21,800
Oh!

935
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,580
Nice!

936
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,300
I saw that one.

937
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:24,760
I saw that one.

938
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,180
Hehe.

939
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,000
Fist!

940
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,700
Filthy!

941
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,040
Oh!

942
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,640
Nuns are freaky!

943
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,080
Oh!

944
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:35,520
Ah!

945
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,500
Hi!

946
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,200
Leo!

947
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,060
Titanium!

948
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,600
Electromagnetic spectrum.

949
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,120
Oh my!

950
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,660
Shoot me down!

951
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,460
I think we need to clean up an aisle too.

952
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,020
Sticks and stones!

953
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:49,640
Oh!

954
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,700
Fuzzy headed morning!

955
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,320
Ouch!

956
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,380
Save the civilian!

957
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,600
Oh shit!

958
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,760
I don't know how to write sausages.

959
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:03,420
Hahaha!

960
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:05,880
Hey!

961
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,940
You assholes in the tank!

962
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,440
Why don't you try using that fucking thing?

963
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:10,800
Yeah!

964
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,760
What are you doing?

965
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,960
Oh shit!

966
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,920
Under your bed!

967
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,300
Take your canvas bags!

968
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,240
Oh my god!

969
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,520
A maze ball!

970
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,320
This one's hard.

971
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,080
Oh!

972
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,600
God!

973
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,280
That one's not easy.

974
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,380
That's disgusting!

975
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,360
How can they do that?

976
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,120
With no barbecue sauce?

977
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,000
Hahaha!

978
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,960
Oh my god!

979
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,620
Haunted!

980
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,240
Haunted!

981
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,640
Oh my god!

982
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,540
My accuracy though!

983
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,160
I'm gonna freak out you guys!

984
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,920
We're going to the saloon!

985
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:00,920
Ah!

986
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,400
Phrase and trombone!

987
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:02,600
Oh my god!

988
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:02,900
Oh nice!

989
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
Oh that was close.

990
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,520
I need health.

991
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,560
I need health!

992
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,420
Varla, look!

993
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,000
Here's your bike!

994
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,440
The bike!

995
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,700
No fucking keys though.

996
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:18,780
Oh!

997
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:19,960
Spurting?

998
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,320
Oh ferocious spinster!

999
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,180
I see the service here hasn't improved.

1000
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,280
Oh my god.

1001
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,580
Oh shit.

1002
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,940
Hyperbolic trajectory!

1003
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,840
I can't spell these things man!

1004
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,480
This is not just...

1005
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,800
This is not just typing!

1006
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,140
Oh!

1007
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,020
What was that?

1008
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,580
Q or O?

1009
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,440
I can't tell actually.

1010
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:49,890
Eee!

1011
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:50,310
Aye!

1012
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:51,330
Okay.

1013
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:54,810
Shushushusha.

1014
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,070
What a bunch of freaks!

1015
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,330
It was Q?

1016
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,010
Oh okay.

1017
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,110
What a bunch of freaks!

1018
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,870
Ooh la la la.

1019
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,890
Forever dancers baby.

1020
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,250
Oh.

1021
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:05,670
Oh my god.

1022
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,470
Oh my god.

1023
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,490
Ugh.

1024
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,810
Sport.

1025
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,050
B2BO are you no type?

1026
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,030
I'm getting performance anxiety!

1027
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,030
I'm on hardcore.

1028
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:17,870
I'm on...

1029
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,450
I'm on mint phantom mode.

1030
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:20,930
Right.

1031
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,890
Which one of you bitches has my fucking keys?

1032
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,750
Her pit is out!

1033
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:30,650
Have you lost weight?

1034
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,290
Where's her little fuck buddy?

1035
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,210
Her bo...

1036
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:33,710
Oh my god!

1037
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,330
Cover up!

1038
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,470
Look for...

1039
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,630
Look at Cindy's stomach.

1040
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,490
Oh fucking gross!

1041
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,030
What are you doing now?

1042
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,350
You take those bitches down!

1043
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,250
Yeah!

1044
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,030
Take them down baby!

1045
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,870
Okay.

1046
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,390
Here we go.

1047
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,070
Coco and Cindy!

1048
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,670
Oh great!

1049
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,300
Uh.

1050
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,880
Uh.

1051
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,240
Ew.

1052
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,020
Oh god.

1053
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,860
They're so gross.

1054
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,320
Ew.

1055
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,500
Oh god.

1056
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:07,860
Ew.

1057
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,700
Ew.

1058
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,320
Ew!

1059
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,180
Levato...

1060
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:10,600
Oh.

1061
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,300
Ew.

1062
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,830
The music's so funky.

1063
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,330
I like it.

1064
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,470
Oh my god.

1065
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,510
The boob I can't get...

1066
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:19,870
I can't...

1067
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,430
I'm just staring at the one boob.

1068
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:21,630
Ow!

1069
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,010
Oh.

1070
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:26,590
Uh.

1071
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,490
Stop running around please!

1072
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,430
I can't read.

1073
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,870
Mainly moist.

1074
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:33,590
Ah.

1075
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,350
Dolores Drinkers.

1076
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,110
Dol...

1077
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:44,690
Okay.

1078
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:48,150
The music is... the lighting and everything is... oh my god.

1079
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,190
Okay.

1080
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,950
Fabulous fetish!

1081
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,170
The music is so funky.

1082
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,190
Okay.

1083
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,770
Breast isn't best.

1084
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,810
What are you talking about?

1085
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,330
Elephantine empress.

1086
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,630
What do you mean breast isn't best?

1087
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,990
This game sucks.

1088
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,910
Oh, we're moving in.

1089
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,430
We're moving in.

1090
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:30,750
Z!

1091
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,230
Okay.

1092
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,680
This one is easier, I think.

1093
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,640
Than the other one.

1094
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,640
The previous boss battle.

1095
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,660
Your bitches never could dance.

1096
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,200
We took her out so easily!

1097
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,740
Ass is gas.

1098
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,940
Ass is gas.

1099
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,360
Ew!

1100
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,880
That's how you wanna go?

1101
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,600
Flattened by...

1102
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,220
By, um...

1103
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,500
A giantess?

1104
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:32,180
My bike better still be in one piece or I'm gonna come back and kill you fucking bitches all over again.

1105
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,380
I love how aggressive everybody is in this game.

1106
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,720
What happened to them?

1107
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,680
How did they get like that?

1108
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,980
Damn if I know.

1109
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,980
But I bet that sick fuck Caesar has something to do with it.

1110
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,560
Caesar!

1111
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,320
Where is he now?

1112
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,060
Caesar!

1113
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,960
Being chased by two asshole cops.

1114
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,000
Then we should go after them.

1115
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,060
No, kid.

1116
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,580
It's too late.

1117
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:49,900
It's too dangerous for you.

1118
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,140
I don't think Candy does anything.

1119
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,660
Jasper wouldn't want you to risk your life avenging him.

1120
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,960
But Popper Caesar killed him.

1121
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,660
Popper Caesar.

1122
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,040
Tell me something I don't know, girl.

1123
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,680
Popper Caesar.

1124
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,920
Well, Jasper had this thing he liked me to do where I'd...

1125
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,280
Fuck!

1126
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,800
I don't need to hear that.

1127
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,540
Now let's get you the fuck out here.

1128
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:07,920
That's her brother!

1129
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,120
Then are you going to try to find Popper Caesar?

1130
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,480
Popper Caesar?

1131
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:12,860
Listen, sister.

1132
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,180
I don't try anything.

1133
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,760
I just get up and do it.

1134
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,200
And when I'm done, that fuck will be dead.

1135
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,100
Now come on!

1136
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,220
Riding into the night.

1137
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,220
A trail of carnage, mayhem, and devastation behind them.

1138
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,500
Driven by a single desire.

1139
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,340
Revenge.

1140
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,460
Revenge, baby!

1141
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,520
I kind of love the writing in this game.

1142
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,740
Complete naked terror.

1143
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,520
My accuracy was still 93%.

1144
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,800
I had no orgasms, though.

1145
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,600
But you know...

1146
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,700
A to C.

1147
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,960
Cs get degrees, okay?

1148
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,040
And I found a secret figurine and a record.

1149
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,320
And I rescued both civilians, okay?

1150
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,200
Okay!

1151
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,580
Gotta use that backspace to switch words.

1152
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,000
That's what it said!

1153
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,340
Oh!

1154
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,560
Okay.

1155
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,160
Because...

1156
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,580
I couldn't read it before because I was playing the game.

1157
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,160
So I couldn't read what it said about the backspace.

1158
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,010
I don't even know what the Gorgasm is.

1159
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,510
I think it's your... I think it's...

1160
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,030
Well, it had a 24 combo.

1161
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,570
I have no idea.

1162
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,710
Tab button to pick up and backspace will help you switch words, right?

1163
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,130
Okay.

1164
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:50,270
Okay.

1165
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,230
Oh, it's a no damage streak.

1166
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:58,510
What's going on?

1167
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,530
What's gonna happen next?

1168
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:01,990
Ballis...

1169
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,390
As you well know, I...

1170
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,410
I enjoy pain.

1171
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:08,370
It's like a good Chinese dinner, you know?

1172
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:09,710
With the sweet...

1173
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,970
Ballistic drama.

1174
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,430
Expanding on that analogy.

1175
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,250
I will smile with delight.

1176
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:17,970
That's the sweet...

1177
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,430
What was Player 2 doing?

1178
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:19,790
Right?

1179
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:21,310
That person sucks.

1180
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,810
Sunday girl, welcome back.

1181
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,290
Are we going to the hospital?

1182
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,170
Is this Metal Gear Solid 5?

1183
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:40,230
Let's go.

1184
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,830
Oh, they're shooting behind me?

1185
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,590
We'll see about that.

1186
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,690
We'll see about that.

1187
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:47,570
What?

1188
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,610
This is making me want Chinese.

1189
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:50,390
Haha.

1190
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:54,410
Tonight, you have been admitted to Bayou County General.

1191
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,330
Rest assured, Clement.

1192
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,310
Clement.

1193
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,810
I have a plan which will eliminate both of them.

1194
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,250
And any evidence of our work here.

1195
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:03,350
Your symptoms?

1196
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,830
Cold sweats.

1197
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,410
Irregular heartbeat.

1198
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:07,570
Anxiety.

1199
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,650
Oh my god, the nurses.

1200
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,970
Oh la la.

1201
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:14,190
The diagnosis, bleeding horror that cuts like a scalpel to the heart.

1202
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,190
What are they doing to him?

1203
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,330
There is only one cure.

1204
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,690
There's only one cure.

1205
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,630
A way-hot boot to the brain.

1206
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:25,810
Ballistic trauma.

1207
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,210
Wee-woo.

1208
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,010
Left you point-blank prescription.

1209
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,010
Wee-woo.

1210
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:33,570
Wee-woo.

1211
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,710
I want what they're having.

1212
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:36,170
Same.

1213
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:37,750
Here we go, baby.

1214
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:40,690
I'm ready.

1215
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:41,790
Doctor.

1216
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:42,430
Doctor.

1217
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,050
I think there's something wrong with me.

1218
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,210
Time for some aggressive surgery.

1219
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,310
Doctor.

1220
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:47,650
Hiding.

1221
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:52,880
Gooseberry!

1222
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,560
Where's your warrant?

1223
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,640
Ooh.

1224
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,300
I got a fever, doctor.

1225
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,020
Yeah!

1226
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,220
Oh.

1227
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:09,820
Oh.

1228
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,180
That one's hard.

1229
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:12,720
Slippery.

1230
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,780
That one is a little slippery.

1231
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:14,880
What the...

1232
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,620
I'm gonna make you mad!

1233
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,520
I'm gonna make you mad!

1234
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,320
I don't want.

1235
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:18,360
She said I should have slept!

1236
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,760
There's a present for you!

1237
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:21,980
Hot dog!

1238
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,880
Settle down!

1239
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,020
Settle down!

1240
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,380
Ugly is as ugly does!

1241
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,120
Oh shit.

1242
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,480
That was close.

1243
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,140
Oh my god, she's running towards us.

1244
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,880
Some of these zombies are crazy!

1245
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,520
Sorry, mutants.

1246
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,360
Chill out!

1247
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:49,940
Chill out!

1248
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:51,940
Doctor!

1249
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,480
Doctor!

1250
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,360
Oh my god.

1251
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,340
She's hot.

1252
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,160
Get out of here, dude!

1253
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,320
Why are you taking the elevator out?

1254
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,580
Pull my finger, monstrosity!

1255
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,700
Where'd the other guy go, though?

1256
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,380
Who's taking pictures?

1257
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,100
Oh.

1258
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,460
Anecdote.

1259
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,920
Oh, why'd the music get kinda scary?

1260
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,000
I'm psychotic!

1261
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,840
Oh, that was so close!

1262
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,040
Oh shit.

1263
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,480
Oh my god.

1264
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,300
Oh, you guys.

1265
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,060
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1266
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,640
This is... I gotta focus.

1267
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,160
Spinal tap!

1268
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,370
Oh my god.

1269
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:11,750
Lung!

1270
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:12,190
Lung!

1271
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:17,910
Oh, got it.

1272
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:18,890
What is that?

1273
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:19,830
Whoa, what's happening?

1274
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,890
Metal Gear game.

1275
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,170
This is a...

1276
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:31,430
Oh!

1277
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,490
Oh, it slowed it down!

1278
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:34,090
That's awesome!

1279
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,470
Yeah!

1280
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:41,690
No!

1281
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:42,510
No!

1282
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:42,770
No!

1283
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:46,690
Uh... Oh shit, it's sausages!

1284
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:47,790
You're not gonna live, bro!

1285
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:48,110
Okay.

1286
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:50,370
I'm alive!

1287
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,030
I'm alive!

1288
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,870
I'm alive!

1289
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:52,390
I'm alive!

1290
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,150
Can we save him?

1291
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:54,150
Furious...

1292
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:55,790
Giraffe...

1293
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,730
I don't even know what half these words are, you guys.

1294
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:00,550
I think I'm an idiot.

1295
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,470
Oh, I saw that poster!

1296
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,430
What the hell does that mean?

1297
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:08,150
Violets.

1298
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,250
I see the poster!

1299
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:12,730
Grab it!

1300
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:13,070
Grab it!

1301
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:13,410
Grab it!

1302
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:13,730
Grab it!

1303
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:14,050
Grab it!

1304
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:14,710
Oh, never mind.

1305
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:15,970
Or something.

1306
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:16,870
There was something there.

1307
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:23,950
Evil Dead!

1308
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:24,970
Okay,

1309
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,780
we're back to the silly music.

1310
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,520
Pork to bite!

1311
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,900
Nasty rash!

1312
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:41,370
Ew!

1313
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:43,150
I left like a bit of a...

1314
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,690
Pumpkin carving!

1315
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,990
Oh!

1316
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,590
Who's taking pictures?

1317
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:53,690
Help us please!

1318
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:54,150
Oh!

1319
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,310
Never mind.

1320
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:00,950
Sorry about your super title, read it.

1321
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:01,290
I'm alive!

1322
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,590
I'm motherfucking still alive!

1323
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:04,610
I'm still alive!

1324
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:04,950
Yeah, just my life.

1325
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,170
Bitches!

1326
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:06,490
Yes!

1327
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:07,450
Oh!

1328
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:15,810
I think we got the slowdown again.

1329
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,230
Obey the crab!

1330
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:20,370
Nice!

1331
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,790
Oh shit!

1332
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:28,790
No!

1333
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,310
Oh my god, she did double damage to me!

1334
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,540
Oh shit!

1335
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,400
No!

1336
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,720
I got the wrong one again!

1337
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,040
Are we going in?

1338
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,050
No orgasm!

1339
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,350
I messed up!

1340
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,330
Who is it called?

1341
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:02,850
I saw health over there.

1342
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:03,830
Give it to me!

1343
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:04,730
Give it to me!

1344
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:05,130
There we go!

1345
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:05,570
Nice!

1346
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,140
Closer, baby!

1347
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,800
Skip level!

1348
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,260
Oh no, my alarm is going off.

1349
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,600
Go, go!

1350
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,930
That was close!

1351
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:30,530
Towel thief!

1352
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:32,550
Cranberry!

1353
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,720
Please use a mirror!

1354
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,800
It's hard to tell which guy is for like which word.

1355
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,720
Chocolate teapot!

1356
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,140
I've fallen and I can't get out!

1357
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,320
I've fallen and I can't get out!

1358
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:54,640
God!

1359
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,580
Oh!

1360
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,780
Ew!

1361
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:01,980
Ew!

1362
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,000
Ew!

1363
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,760
The whole scared of aging was pretty funny.

1364
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,280
The whole scared of aging was pretty funny.

1365
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,380
Ew!

1366
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,560
Chastity belt!

1367
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,740
They're good at picking words that are really hard.

1368
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,160
They're good at picking words that are really hard.

1369
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,480
I ain't no mutant!

1370
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,460
Uh...

1371
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,000
I got him.

1372
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,760
You're welcome!

1373
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,520
Get out of here, mister!

1374
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,660
Show me those fingers, baby!

1375
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,120
Yubi yubi!

1376
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,020
Yubi yubi!

1377
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:44,830
Beep beep beep beep!

1378
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:46,110
Oh!

1379
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:48,450
Oh, goodness!

1380
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:50,610
That's a reason to go to the hospital!

1381
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:52,330
Nice!

1382
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:55,930
Come on!

1383
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,310
Don't wanna waste my slowdown!

1384
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,230
Wait, I'm wasting my slowdown.

1385
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:00,690
What a waste!

1386
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,490
Wait, what a waste!

1387
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:10,850
What a waste!

1388
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:11,630
Hahaha!

1389
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:13,930
Oh!

1390
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:16,850
Oh!

1391
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,950
You stole my sandwich!

1392
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,970
Oh, I saw the health over there!

1393
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:26,130
Thanks for the super chat!

1394
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:26,570
No!

1395
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,110
My health!

1396
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:31,350
I see it!

1397
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:31,770
I see it!

1398
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:31,950
Grab it!

1399
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:32,190
Grab it!

1400
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:32,950
Oh, dang it.

1401
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:33,470
I missed it.

1402
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:36,170
I'm spamming.

1403
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:36,730
I'm spamming.

1404
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:37,050
I'm tired of vanilla.

1405
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:38,570
Oh!

1406
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:43,340
Oh!

1407
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,320
Oh, shit!

1408
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,140
Oh, shit!

1409
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:48,980
Mardi Gras!

1410
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,680
Extreme bias!

1411
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:58,280
Extreme bias!

1412
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:02,800
I'm scared.

1413
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,500
I'm scared, Elias.

1414
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,380
I'm not gonna make it.

1415
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,260
I'm not gonna get an A.

1416
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,040
Filthy thoughts!

1417
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,180
Oh!

1418
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,440
Freaky eye thing!

1419
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,540
Oh, my God!

1420
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,060
Sometimes I, like, think I'm pressing a letter and I really don't.

1421
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,440
Hello?

1422
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,180
Anybody here?

1423
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:30,620
Oh!

1424
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:36,270
Oh!

1425
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:39,830
Oh, my God!

1426
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,170
Oh, my God!

1427
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:41,510
Please!

1428
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:43,010
Give me lemons!

1429
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:44,690
Dead wrong!

1430
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,050
The other one was too hard, man!

1431
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,410
The other one was too hard!

1432
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:54,750
They're speaking Latin.

1433
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:08,470
Rufy!

1434
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:09,290
Oh, my gosh.

1435
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:10,670
I knew I wasn't gonna get that one.

1436
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,390
Oh, this is hard!

1437
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:14,570
Holy cow!

1438
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:18,810
Oh.

1439
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:20,010
Beach again!

1440
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,010
Shoot!

1441
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:25,630
Shoot!

1442
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:26,290
Extreme violence!

1443
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:27,550
Extreme violence!

1444
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,870
Oh!

1445
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:29,410
Chop!

1446
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:30,030
Chop!

1447
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,200
Oof!

1448
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,320
Sour mash!

1449
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,300
Got a comic.

1450
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:51,430
Okay.

1451
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,420
Nice.

1452
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,140
I'm just keep pressing tab.

1453
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,740
Nice.

1454
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,000
Take it.

1455
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:02,820
My arm!

1456
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:03,700
My arm fell off!

1457
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,560
You're a liar!

1458
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,820
You had both arms!

1459
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,400
Ultraviolence!

1460
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,380
Ultraviolence!

1461
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:15,820
Oh!

1462
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,420
Oh!

1463
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,820
This looks like a boss room.

1464
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:18,700
Maybe.

1465
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,060
Maybe.

1466
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:20,380
Oh!

1467
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:20,680
Oh!

1468
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,040
Oh!

1469
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:21,380
Oh!

1470
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:22,620
Eww!

1471
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:23,980
Let's go.

1472
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:24,360
Eww!

1473
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:24,740
Oh!

1474
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,060
Gross!

1475
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,220
Why did we go in here?

1476
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,640
That was not very smart.

1477
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:30,480
Hahaha!

1478
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,720
Lying zombie.

1479
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,200
He's like, my arm fell off!

1480
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,100
He's like...

1481
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,400
You are an absolute liar!

1482
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,760
You literally had both arms!

1483
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,660
Ma 'am, are you okay?

1484
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,540
Move aside, diaper shit!

1485
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,340
Let a man handle this!

1486
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:44,940
Oh my god!

1487
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:47,680
Motherfuck!

1488
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:51,330
Eww!

1489
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,320
Please, my ears!

1490
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,180
Move aside, diaper shit!

1491
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,140
Shoves her.

1492
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,380
Screamer!

1493
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,440
Okay.

1494
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:08,740
Alright.

1495
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,180
I turned down the volume just a little bit.

1496
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,360
Because I don't want to hear...

1497
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,340
Oh my god.

1498
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,180
Where did she go?

1499
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:19,880
Where did she go?

1500
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,380
No fucking idea.

1501
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,380
But next time I see her, I'm shooting her right in the face.

1502
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,880
Why does he sometimes sound like Snake?

1503
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,180
Oh my god.

1504
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:27,520
No way.

1505
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:27,980
N.

1506
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,440
Q.

1507
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,060
S.

1508
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:29,380
A.

1509
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:29,820
V.

1510
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:30,180
B.

1511
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:39,520
Ugh.

1512
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,160
Oh my god.

1513
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:40,460
Ah!

1514
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,820
I don't know if I got the right one.

1515
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,360
I don't think I did.

1516
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,180
What the?

1517
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,160
Did you say something, Detective Washington?

1518
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:58,800
Wait, what?

1519
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,980
Only one is real?

1520
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:00,760
Oh my god.

1521
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,200
No way.

1522
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:03,700
Is there a way to tell?

1523
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,480
Oh god.

1524
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:07,980
Ooh, scary.

1525
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:08,780
This one's freaky.

1526
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,380
Oh, these are so fun.

1527
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,240
Each boss is so different.

1528
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:15,700
I love it.

1529
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:18,420
Oh my god.

1530
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,320
Oh my god.

1531
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:20,020
K.

1532
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:20,340
D.

1533
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:20,980
I.

1534
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:21,440
O.

1535
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:21,800
Y.

1536
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,140
X.

1537
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:22,400
R.

1538
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,320
Nice.

1539
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,440
Zombie ghost.

1540
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,460
This is so awesome.

1541
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,220
I love this one so much.

1542
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:32,380
Oh.

1543
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,990
Why am I so bad at choosing the right one?

1544
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,830
How do you know which one is the correct one?

1545
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,340
Oh, it doesn't flicker.

1546
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:56,960
Okay, okay.

1547
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:57,700
I'm too busy.

1548
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,620
I'm not looking at her.

1549
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,040
I'm too busy looking at the words.

1550
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:03,380
Oh, shoot.

1551
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:03,900
C.

1552
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:04,260
Z.

1553
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:04,720
L.

1554
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:05,380
A.

1555
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:05,620
T.

1556
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:05,980
M.

1557
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,160
Q.

1558
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,900
The correct one is solid.

1559
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,460
Okay, okay.

1560
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:11,620
Okay.

1561
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,200
No!

1562
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,500
Oh my...

1563
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,940
Screw procedure.

1564
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:19,880
Yeah.

1565
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,260
Can't even speak anymore.

1566
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:24,800
Oh.

1567
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,020
I see it now.

1568
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:27,720
Thank you guys.

1569
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,570
That should be it.

1570
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:39,090
There we go.

1571
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:43,810
She can't spell with her mouth.

1572
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:44,950
Procedure.

1573
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:46,210
Procedure.

1574
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:47,910
Screw procedure.

1575
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:50,950
That's not my phone.

1576
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:53,330
An unexpected complication.

1577
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:55,830
The bitch is ringing.

1578
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,260
No mother fucking way, man.

1579
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,920
I manicured only yesterday.

1580
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,160
You manicured.

1581
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,520
What if I fucking do?

1582
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,780
These ain't going inside that bitch.

1583
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,720
No finger fucking way.

1584
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,400
Yeah, you tell him.

1585
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,540
Get in there, babe.

1586
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,180
Oh my god.

1587
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,960
Oh, he's treating it like an art.

1588
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:28,060
Who could be behind such depravity?

1589
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,380
That looks more like a bomb than a phone.

1590
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:30,780
It's for you.

1591
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:31,460
What the?

1592
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,360
Isaac, darling.

1593
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,340
Caesar!

1594
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,200
Papa strikes again.

1595
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,660
As you well know, Isaac, I enjoy pain.

1596
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,560
It's like a good Chinese dinner, you know.

1597
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,120
This guy can't get over his Chinese dinner.

1598
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:52,720
Expanding on that analogy, I will smile with delight.

1599
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,700
That's the sweet.

1600
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,300
As you scream for your fucking life.

1601
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,460
Of course, that's the sour.

1602
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,540
Oh, ciao.

1603
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,680
I think it's gonna...

1604
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,740
Is it gonna explode?

1605
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,040
Yeah.

1606
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,700
Get out of here!

1607
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,480
Succulent Chinese meal.

1608
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,900
It's making me hungry.

1609
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,760
All I had for breakfast was anpan.

1610
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,340
Not the car second time.

1611
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,720
This guy is...

1612
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,500
a howling hellcat humping a hot steel hog.

1613
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,340
The hog.

1614
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,760
And you, crock and tug, jump on.

1615
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:38,640
Hog.

1616
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,840
A seductive she-devil beating a pair of pigs on a roaring rampage of revenge.

1617
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,360
Oh,

1618
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:55,670
we got a bee!

1619
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:57,610
Okay, okay.

1620
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:57,810
Okay.

1621
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,310
And I had Gorgasm for just a little bit.

1622
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:03,850
I didn't get any of the figurines though.

1623
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:04,610
Oh wait, there were none.

1624
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:05,570
Stupid.

1625
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:07,050
I got everything!

1626
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:09,050
Oh my gosh!

1627
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:13,770
Bee.

1628
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:16,170
95% accuracy.

1629
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:21,370
Cranking the hog.

1630
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:24,210
Yeah!

1631
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:27,890
She's a pro, everybody.

1632
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:28,470
She's a pro.

1633
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:29,950
Player 2 is useless.

1634
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,390
Player 2, we hate that guy.

1635
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:37,590
If you pick 2 player, do you both use the same keyboard?

1636
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:38,150
I don't know.

1637
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:39,350
Has anybody done 2 player?

1638
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:46,210
If Leo wants to come play, she can come to my room and then she can use...

1639
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:50,010
I could use the laptop keyboard and she could use my other keyboard.

1640
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,320
She's probably not even still here.

1641
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,960
Why do you have 2 keyboards?

1642
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,160
Because imagine playing games on a laptop keyboard.

1643
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,140
It's the worst ever.

1644
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:17,870
It was a shared keyboard?

1645
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:19,030
Yuck.

1646
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:28,670
Carnie.

1647
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:31,710
Do you guys have a fear of clowns and stuff?

1648
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:41,930
I can't believe that this was in arcades and stuff even.

1649
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:44,930
No, I don't fear you.

1650
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:50,270
I'm going to become the Joker.

1651
01:01:53,410 --> 01:02:01,030
I am going to literally I am going to I like clowns actually.

1652
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,010
I fear I may be a clown.

1653
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:04,850
Yeah.

1654
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,810
We all clown a little bit.

1655
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:11,250
We all clown around a little bit, don't we?

1656
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:12,530
You know.

1657
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:15,770
We're all a little bit funky fresh.

1658
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,210
But actually, I'm so curious.

1659
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:20,590
How do you play this on a Wii?

1660
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,310
I'm like legitimately confused.

1661
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:27,530
This guy is just talking to himself.

1662
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,120
Wait, the Wii...

1663
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:37,200
Oh, it wasn't a typing game.

1664
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:41,920
Oh, I see.

1665
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:42,120
I see.

1666
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,860
So it's just a shooter.

1667
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,600
Then why was it called typing of the dead?

1668
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:52,580
Just shooting.

1669
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,360
No typing.

1670
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:00,370
Sorry, I misremembered.

1671
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:00,910
Two keyboards.

1672
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:01,450
Oh.

1673
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:01,570
Oh.

1674
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:04,290
Like a sardine in a mother fucking tin can!

1675
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:09,530
Was that a thanks for saving my worthless pig hide I just heard, Lieutenant Limp Dick?

1676
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:10,070
Was that a thanks for saving my worthless pig hide I just heard, Lieutenant Limp Dick?

1677
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:14,010
We're both very appreciative of you coming to our rescue, miss.

1678
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:15,210
Varla.

1679
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:21,500
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1680
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:24,410
Why is it so loud?

1681
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:26,690
Ball of fucking guns?

1682
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,890
What kind of name is that?

1683
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:31,370
The name I was born with, dipshit.

1684
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:33,310
Did you see my birth was celebrate.

1685
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,590
Sounds like the best name ever.

1686
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,170
What is this shirt?

1687
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:56,190
Is it like a Mothman?

1688
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:00,910
What is this shirt?

1689
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:04,550
Is it like a Mothman?

1690
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,830
D D D D baby baby baby.

1691
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:14,690
Top secret.

1692
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:19,190
Is it personal or... wait why?

1693
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:30,010
You could have just moved around him.

1694
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:32,630
Why are we stopping in front of this guy?

1695
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:35,270
Ew.

1696
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,350
Sherlock.

1697
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:44,990
If you're both finished admiring each other's dicks, can I remind you we have a fucking mass murdering psychopath son of a bitch to catch?

1698
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:46,710
You wait there woman.

1699
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:50,630
Agent Gwendolyn and me are gonna check this shit out.

1700
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:51,430
Fuck you.

1701
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:53,770
Everybody is so aggressive.

1702
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:54,890
What happened to Candy?

1703
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:55,550
Mother fuck.

1704
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:59,830
What does a brother have to do to pacify a bitch?

1705
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:03,390
I'm telling you G, I tried my best with her.

1706
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:05,210
God be my witness.

1707
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:07,130
Look at the way he's standing.

1708
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:09,910
Oh you can't see my head, my head was blocking it.

1709
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:13,210
Look at the way he's standing.

1710
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:17,830
Ladies and gentlemen, the infinite tact of Isaac Washington.

1711
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:26,190
You do, truly you do, use your tongue better than a thirty dollar hooker.

1712
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:35,470
And man, can I say from the bottom of my heart, you are a shining example to all of us.

1713
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:36,370
Mankind.

1714
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:37,710
Is this the time to be fighting?

1715
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:38,770
Don't make me hit you again.

1716
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:41,010
Yeah, stop fighting girlies.

1717
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:45,230
Carny, a thousand tiny fingers clawing at your spine.

1718
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:47,610
I need a, I need a tissue.

1719
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:49,590
But no time.

1720
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:51,590
Time to shoot some mutants.

1721
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:56,870
Uh oh.

1722
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,590
The clowns are loose.

1723
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:02,770
Stop clowning around.

1724
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:05,070
Oh my god, the leg.

1725
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,540
Why are sometimes they're green?

1726
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,760
Is this some kind of fucking sick joke?

1727
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,420
Green is the furthest away.

1728
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,260
Oh I see.

1729
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:42,480
I'm just, I'm on like the, I'm on like the fourth chapter or something and I'm just now learning how the game works.

1730
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:45,740
That guy.

1731
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:48,900
Sometimes

1732
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:56,820
they're all yellow.

1733
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,480
It's so annoying.

1734
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:58,800
Hold your fire.

1735
01:06:58,900 --> 01:06:59,360
Hold your fire.

1736
01:06:59,460 --> 01:06:59,760
Oh god.

1737
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,560
Catch him!

1738
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,820
This will hurt.

1739
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,200
Do you?

1740
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,560
I got him.

1741
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,120
I got him.

1742
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:23,840
This is bad.

1743
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,160
X.

1744
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,340
Damn right this is bad.

1745
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,520
Those hands in the...

1746
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,400
Oh god.

1747
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,420
I'm gonna make your fucking side split.

1748
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,420
Wait, what happened to the...

1749
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:33,800
Oh.

1750
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:34,360
Oh, he was talking.

1751
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:34,740
That's why.

1752
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,420
Ice, ice, baby!

1753
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,680
Okay, okay.

1754
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,400
Getting the hang of it a little bit.

1755
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,520
A little bit at a time.

1756
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,460
Liar, liar.

1757
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,840
Pants on fire.

1758
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:56,900
Ice, ice.

1759
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,800
Oh, before Wicked.

1760
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:06,920
What the hell did I...

1761
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,680
Oh my god.

1762
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:10,340
Hold your fire.

1763
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,620
What is it?

1764
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:13,120
Roasted.

1765
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:13,860
There we go.

1766
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,220
Liar, liar.

1767
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:17,760
Lambda.

1768
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,820
How are some of these people still alive?

1769
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,220
Like, where were you hiding?

1770
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,700
Hurt me more, snake.

1771
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:30,120
Uh-oh.

1772
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:30,980
Wrong way!

1773
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:32,400
Okay.

1774
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,320
This way.

1775
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,320
Oh, tab, tab, tab.

1776
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,800
Oh, I got the slowdown.

1777
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:37,340
No, no!

1778
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,340
I'm wasting it again!

1779
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:40,980
I'm wasting the slowdown!

1780
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,420
Okay, whatever.

1781
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:53,940
Why, the gentleman!

1782
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,640
Oh shit.

1783
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:56,980
Stay a while!

1784
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,880
Egg and spoon break.

1785
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:02,940
Oh, I got another one.

1786
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:03,480
Okay.

1787
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,240
Oh my god.

1788
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,080
What are these words?

1789
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:09,400
Wunderbush.

1790
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:10,800
What are these words?

1791
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,820
Never even heard of that before.

1792
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:17,860
I'm not even thinking of what I'm typing anymore.

1793
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:18,760
This does not look good.

1794
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,380
Good, good.

1795
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,380
I'm just like.

1796
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,160
No, nothing good.

1797
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,020
I'm seeing...

1798
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:24,280
Oh my god!

1799
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:27,780
Punch him!

1800
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:30,900
Punch him!

1801
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:33,300
Punch him!

1802
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:34,560
Crack his head!

1803
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:36,480
God!

1804
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:48,970
Oh my god!

1805
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:51,830
Koji!

1806
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,120
Nymphomania!

1807
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,620
I was a nymph.

1808
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,040
Thank you for your service.

1809
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,160
C-E-P-H-U

1810
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,680
What about those guys?

1811
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:21,560
Get them!

1812
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,160
Get their butts!

1813
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,440
Okay, we're just gonna ignore those guys, I guess.

1814
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:27,620
Have you seen my cat?

1815
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,100
That's not what I asked.

1816
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,540
Lock, stock, and...

1817
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:33,020
Oh shit!

1818
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,060
I ask that all the time.

1819
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,080
Have you seen my cat?

1820
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:48,730
Golden goose!

1821
01:10:53,530 --> 01:11:01,210
Jolly Roger Outer Space I can smell him.

1822
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:03,150
I miss my cat so much.

1823
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:07,750
Oh shit.

1824
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:11,770
Big dipper.

1825
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,210
Thank god that I...

1826
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:16,170
I was scratching the back of my head!

1827
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:18,870
Procedure can kiss my ass.

1828
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,650
Yeah, procedure can kiss my ass.

1829
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:23,510
Are we gonna save that girl?

1830
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:27,790
Oh my god.

1831
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:30,030
My sweet bite.

1832
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:32,450
He's asking...

1833
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:34,110
He's asking procedure.

1834
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:34,950
He's fire, everybody.

1835
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,190
Not the five-finger discount!

1836
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:39,390
Oh.

1837
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:48,380
Tortoiseshell.

1838
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:49,200
Okay.

1839
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,580
Number one.

1840
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:52,600
The only...

1841
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:52,680
Number one.

1842
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:52,680
The only...

1843
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,980
Xylophone fan.

1844
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,340
Xylophone fan.

1845
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,740
Drinking from...

1846
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:06,720
Oh yeah!

1847
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:08,760
Yeah!

1848
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,740
Aim for the chest!

1849
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:17,100
Nice.

1850
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:20,000
Nice.

1851
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:21,320
Tortoiseshell.

1852
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:22,700
Tortoiseshell.

1853
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,900
I just completely forgot to press...

1854
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:31,440
Tabab tab.

1855
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:32,040
Is there...

1856
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,520
What's the word?

1857
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:35,000
Oh my gosh.

1858
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:35,320
Tab!

1859
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:36,140
Sorry.

1860
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,140
I'm so...

1861
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:41,240
Vibrating peripheral.

1862
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,960
I'm so focused on the words.

1863
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:47,640
I'm so focused on the words.

1864
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,280
The mutant compound must have raised their metabolic rate.

1865
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:50,760
The mutant compound must have raised their metabolic rate.

1866
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,200
Boy, I don't understand half the shit that comes out of your mouth.

1867
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:55,060
Boy, I don't understand half the shit that comes out of your mouth.

1868
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,260
Incinerate!

1869
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:00,500
Oh, what the?

1870
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,260
No, I...

1871
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:05,270
Maybe I shouldn't do it in all caps.

1872
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:06,550
That's what's slowing me down.

1873
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:12,830
Why didn't we keep the hammer?

1874
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:16,310
Why didn't we keep the...

1875
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:17,590
Oh, we got another hammer this time.

1876
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:20,030
Why didn't we keep the hammer?

1877
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:25,250
Oh, there's no...

1878
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:25,930
What happened to the sound?

1879
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:27,530
Hello?

1880
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:29,390
Hello?

1881
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:31,030
Hello?

1882
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:32,510
Hello?

1883
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:40,350
My head moved.

1884
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:42,570
Oh!

1885
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:43,130
Oh

1886
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:48,150
my god!

1887
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:49,170
We'll get her.

1888
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:49,670
Maybe.

1889
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:50,710
Munch?

1890
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,970
Sound ok.

1891
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:55,950
Thank you.

1892
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:57,670
You're welcome.

1893
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:01,030
Vocabulary.

1894
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,280
Oh my god.

1895
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:07,640
Vocabu...

1896
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,040
What the hell does that mean?

1897
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,300
Am I...

1898
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:12,820
Motherfucker.

1899
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:13,960
N.

1900
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:14,480
J.

1901
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,600
Oof, that was close.

1902
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,560
Oh my god, another civilian?

1903
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,540
Ask Mr. Webster.

1904
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,720
You're welcome.

1905
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,980
You're not gonna make it.

1906
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,920
You are not gonna make it.

1907
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,500
You're like limping.

1908
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,520
Saxophone!

1909
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:43,460
Saxophone!

1910
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:44,920
Saxophone!

1911
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,580
More than mutants, it's mutant carnies!

1912
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,540
Oh my goodness.

1913
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:05,700
Oh.

1914
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:09,140
Wailing plots, marching band.

1915
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,120
To sing you goodbye.

1916
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:13,620
To sing you goodbye.

1917
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,020
Stay.

1918
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,300
Oh my god, this is the perfect time.

1919
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,080
To have the slowdown.

1920
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,780
Oh my god.

1921
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:27,460
Oh my god.

1922
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:29,000
Oof.

1923
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,540
Oh my god.

1924
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,200
Cucumber confusion!

1925
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:41,960
Cucumber confusion!

1926
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:42,460
Oh, come on.

1927
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:47,010
That one's hard.

1928
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:48,650
The 50-50 is hard.

1929
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:51,070
Donut!

1930
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,440
Cucumber confusion.

1931
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,920
Look at that guy back there dancing.

1932
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,940
Look at that guy back there dancing.

1933
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:00,460
Where?

1934
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,440
I couldn't see what those games were.

1935
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,920
I don't know how to spell vengeance.

1936
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:12,060
I don't know how to spell vengeance.

1937
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,380
Yeah, I won't let you have the satisfaction of touching me.

1938
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:28,820
Cue!

1939
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,520
Fly, you fools.

1940
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:36,040
Fly, you fools.

1941
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:39,440
Nice.

1942
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,100
Nice, nice.

1943
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,380
Mutant shot the food!

1944
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,320
Oh shit.

1945
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,000
Oh my god, oh my god.

1946
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,820
A cranberry!

1947
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:51,880
Thanks, game.

1948
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,060
How am I doing that?

1949
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,300
Oh, you shitting me, man?

1950
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:57,500
How am I doing, actually?

1951
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:59,620
Oh, into the house!

1952
01:16:59,640 --> 01:16:59,980
Let's go!

1953
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,380
This place is pretty spooky.

1954
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:03,940
Spooky!

1955
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,680
Are you holding my hand?

1956
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,020
Wait.

1957
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,020
I ain't your mama!

1958
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,720
Get the fuck off of me!

1959
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:11,820
Oh.

1960
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,740
Which ones are real?

1961
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,320
Oh.

1962
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:24,320
Oh!

1963
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:25,500
Oh, that was close.

1964
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:27,300
Too scary for me.

1965
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,800
Which ones are real, you guys?

1966
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,500
Which ones are real?

1967
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:31,300
Which ones are fake?

1968
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,500
I don't know.

1969
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,500
Look at all the...

1970
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,760
They're just all the same animatronics.

1971
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,180
They're just all the same animatronics.

1972
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,280
I'm doing well.

1973
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:43,020
Yippee!

1974
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,100
U.S.

1975
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:45,380
Breach!

1976
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,160
Oh.

1977
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,740
I got the slow-mo again.

1978
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:53,330
Thank you.

1979
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:04,790
G.A.W.

1980
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:05,090
Oh.

1981
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:06,390
I think I missed some of those.

1982
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:16,790
I forgot for a second we were playing a game.

1983
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:18,630
I was excited to be on the...

1984
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:20,270
On the thing.

1985
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:21,570
On the ride.

1986
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:27,250
Jellied eels?

1987
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:28,730
Oh, it's eel season right now.

1988
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:29,650
Oh.

1989
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:32,610
Oh.

1990
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:32,990
Shit, man.

1991
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:33,990
That ain't right.

1992
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:35,310
Vordae?

1993
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:35,970
What are you talking about?

1994
01:18:37,690 --> 01:18:39,030
Oh my god...

1995
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:42,090
How is everything breaking apart like this?

1996
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:43,050
I thought the zombies...

1997
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,260
Sadious relatives.

1998
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:51,120
So true.

1999
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:53,800
Euphonium!

2000
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:57,520
Uh...

2001
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:00,890
LeTude!

2002
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:01,030
Dude!

2003
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:02,270
Psychotic!

2004
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:06,650
End of pain!

2005
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:08,230
Easy does it.

2006
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:21,410
Don't bark at Dennis.

2007
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:22,650
Kinky words!

2008
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:27,430
Oh shit.

2009
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:35,570
Karaoke singer!

2010
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:38,950
I know how to type karaoke really fast because of streams!

2011
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,850
Is it Kinky Wednesday you guys?

2012
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:44,330
What day is it for you?

2013
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:45,690
Wait, I can't remember.

2014
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:46,270
Is it Thursday?

2015
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:48,230
It's Kinky Wednesday!

2016
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:52,470
It's Kinky Wednesday everybody.

2017
01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:54,130
Well not for me.

2018
01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:55,210
For you maybe.

2019
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:06,690
I can finally drink some water and blink my eyes.

2020
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:10,510
Oh my god, I've been like... I've been locked in for so long.

2021
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:16,050
Okay, just shoot him!

2022
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:17,970
Just shoot him if he's yours!

2023
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:20,710
Happy Kinky Wednesday everybody.

2024
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:24,910
Kinky Wednesday!

2025
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:34,690
You're fucking disgusting, Nigel!

2026
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:36,010
Oh my god, he can speak!

2027
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:40,170
AMS agent, put your hands in the air!

2028
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:41,270
All of them!

2029
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,550
If you be so motherfucking kind!

2030
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:49,910
How is he able to speak?

2031
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:52,050
How is he sentient?

2032
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:53,850
Nigel...

2033
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:55,790
Nigel and Sebastian.

2034
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:00,730
He's like smiling in the picture.

2035
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:02,450
He looks so friendly.

2036
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:08,050
Shoot that freaky little motherfucker!

2037
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:09,310
Yeah, shoot him!

2038
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:11,730
Yeah, punk!

2039
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:15,910
This music is... I'm not feeling it.

2040
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:16,270
Here he comes!

2041
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:16,730
Oh god.

2042
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:19,990
I'm not really feeling it, the music.

2043
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:22,610
Is it gonna pick up?

2044
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:22,910
Back up!

2045
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:23,750
Back up!

2046
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,190
Yeah, back up, back up, back up!

2047
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:27,650
Oh god, sausage!

2048
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:29,870
I can't smell sausage!

2049
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,640
Alligator man!

2050
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:44,980
Oh, shoot.

2051
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,600
Is that their names?

2052
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,660
Now that can't be hygienic.

2053
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:59,080
You're worried about hygiene at a time like this?

2054
01:21:59,220 --> 01:21:59,620
Oh my god.

2055
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,240
Oh.

2056
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,980
Flopsy Parker!

2057
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,520
Uh oh.

2058
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:10,750
Okay.

2059
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:12,610
Huh?

2060
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:13,550
What's happening?

2061
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:15,490
What's going on?

2062
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,690
The music is too happy.

2063
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:23,010
It's so funny though.

2064
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:25,310
Oh.

2065
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:33,620
Oh.

2066
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,780
He's getting too close.

2067
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:40,420
Yeah, back up!

2068
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:40,760
Back up!

2069
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:41,060
Back up!

2070
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:44,420
Identity theft.

2071
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,640
It's not a joke.

2072
01:22:58,570 --> 01:22:59,050
Nice.

2073
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:00,870
Dang it!

2074
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:01,630
No!

2075
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:03,250
I was so close!

2076
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:05,330
Why?

2077
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:05,990
Oh, shit.

2078
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:06,610
Oh, shit.

2079
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:08,370
Aloha?

2080
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:10,710
Who names their clown name Aloha?

2081
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:15,110
People, people, but...

2082
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:17,110
This is some pee-pee music.

2083
01:23:17,810 --> 01:23:18,290
Oh, shit.

2084
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:19,250
Sibbity toilet.

2085
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:25,460
Oops.

2086
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,160
That was close.

2087
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:34,650
People, people, people, peep, peep, pop, peep.

2088
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:38,710
Come on, come on.

2089
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:39,450
Just a few more.

2090
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:40,490
Just a few more maybe.

2091
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:41,050
Or one more.

2092
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:44,670
You want to be my little monorail kitten?

2093
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:53,270
People, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep.

2094
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:56,930
Motherfucker.

2095
01:23:57,230 --> 01:24:00,150
That bastard had to be the sickest mutant yet.

2096
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:03,410
It's still alive.

2097
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:03,690
Oh, God.

2098
01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:04,790
Oh, shit.

2099
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:06,970
Anyway, it started blasting.

2100
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:15,630
So now we're stuck out here in the ass end of nowhere with no ride and motherfucking Papa Caesar on a train to fuck knows where by now.

2101
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:17,730
Who was that guy?

2102
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:18,990
And where the fuck have you gone?

2103
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:19,310
Oh.

2104
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,970
Don't make me go calling your stupid ass name.

2105
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:22,470
Gee.

2106
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:23,250
Oh, shit.

2107
01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:24,550
Agent G.

2108
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:26,290
Wait, where did I go?

2109
01:24:26,610 --> 01:24:28,850
No fucking way.

2110
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:40,440
You know, Washington, a man driving a car with his own choice of music is one of the finest experiences he can have in an automobile.

2111
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:42,540
All right, Captain Green Pie.

2112
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:43,240
You call this an automobile?

2113
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,280
You guys see the name of the thing?

2114
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,160
Music, man, motor.

2115
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:46,800
Captain Green Pie?

2116
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,000
Isolated from the outside world.

2117
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:54,020
The music making you nod your head with every beat while the outside's just passing you by.

2118
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:54,140
Okay.

2119
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:01,340
So, what kind of carnival is this?

2120
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:03,920
Don't ever ride with your feet up on the dashboard, you guys.

2121
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:04,460
Oh, my God.

2122
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:05,480
Stop the curve.

2123
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:10,040
Before knowing he can trust that motherfucker.

2124
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,260
What kind of carnival is this?

2125
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:12,380
These things take time.

2126
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:26,060
Here I am, teamed up with a partner I don't even fucking need, forced to sit in the motherfucking passenger seat, which I have not fucking done since I was a kid, while he goes all soft, talking about his life.

2127
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:28,320
I'm gonna take his feelings for his motherfucking tune.

2128
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:31,080
Kyle, you take that Super Chat back right now.

2129
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:31,200
Shit.

2130
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:31,860
Just play your fucking music.

2131
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:33,600
You take that back!

2132
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:37,000
You take that Super Chat back.

2133
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,400
What the fuck!

2134
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:43,080
I was listening to that.

2135
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:48,500
You fucking think because you scored us this fucking popsicle ride you can play that shit?

2136
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,000
Hey, hey, hey.

2137
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:51,540
That there is country westerns finest.

2138
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,500
Yeah, country and westerns.

2139
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:53,600
You are one fuck of fuck!

2140
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:54,580
You know that?

2141
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:56,020
That's offensive shit!

2142
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:58,440
What is this game?

2143
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:06,200
This game is insane.

2144
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:13,720
Conver-mother-effin-sation.

2145
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,040
Now what are you gonna listen to, huh?

2146
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:23,320
Can I drive?

2147
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:38,020
Can I have a lollipop?

2148
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,820
This game is so stupid.

2149
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,960
Oh, we got a B again.

2150
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:48,120
But my accuracy went up a little.

2151
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:51,140
My Gorgasm also went up.

2152
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:55,320
Oh, I almost got all the comics and the figurines.

2153
01:26:58,620 --> 01:27:00,840
Didn't see what Kyle said, but I second it.

2154
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:02,060
Wait, what do you mean?

2155
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,020
Oh, no!

2156
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:06,880
Give me one second, you guys.

2157
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,500
I gotta get tissue for my nose.

2158
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,280
My nose is kinda runny today.

2159
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:12,700
Give me a second.

2160
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:35,340
Okay.

2161
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:38,620
No!

2162
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:40,580
Stop!

2163
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,600
Fuck it up!

2164
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,260
What is wrong with you guys?

2165
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,580
Maybe it's the pollen.

2166
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,340
No, I think it's my brain fluid leaking out my nose.

2167
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,000
Thanks for the gifted ducky.

2168
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:52,420
Thanks for the silver tattoo, guys!

2169
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,200
Thank you!

2170
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:54,700
Oh, wait.

2171
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,780
Someone sent me one earlier and I was too busy playing the game.

2172
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:59,140
I couldn't read it.

2173
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:02,060
I'll have to go back and see what it was.

2174
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:07,640
Okay.

2175
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:10,420
Also, this hotel...

2176
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:11,380
Um...

2177
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:12,680
Left...

2178
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,640
They had like chocolates and I grabbed some.

2179
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,140
Should I have...

2180
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:17,800
Wait, I shouldn't have the white chocolate.

2181
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:19,180
I'll have the dark chocolate.

2182
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:20,840
It has...

2183
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,700
It has some stuff in it.

2184
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:23,320
Like a zinc.

2185
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:25,300
Kyle...

2186
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:29,420
How dare you show your face around here after that.

2187
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,320
Do they give you free bottled water?

2188
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:37,820
Most hotels in Japan have the free water.

2189
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:40,060
If they have water bottles.

2190
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:43,920
It's not like America where the water bottles are like six bucks.

2191
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,540
In Japan, they're usually complimentary because they're not monsters.

2192
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:11,420
In America, get charged for opening the fridge.

2193
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,240
I know, right?

2194
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:12,420
Alright.

2195
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,020
What is in this chocolate?

2196
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:21,880
It's crunchy.

2197
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:22,820
Whoa.

2198
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:26,460
Meat is murder.

2199
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:33,300
Mmm.

2200
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:36,420
I don't know.

2201
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:38,220
I don't know what it's crunching in here.

2202
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,080
I have no idea.

2203
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,040
Oh, it's little pieces of cocoa.

2204
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:43,240
Cocoa.

2205
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:44,520
Cacao.

2206
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:48,240
Not the Minotaur.

2207
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:49,440
The Mintotaur?

2208
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:55,160
This game is nuts.

2209
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:56,260
I'm having so much fun though.

2210
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,560
I've only been playing for an hour and a half.

2211
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,720
I think I could probably...

2212
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:02,280
Is this all the...

2213
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,240
Is this all the levels?

2214
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:04,280
Hold on.

2215
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,140
I'm going to make myself a little bit smaller.

2216
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:08,100
Sorry for not doing this way sooner.

2217
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,320
And let's move the notifications.

2218
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,820
We'll move them like up here.

2219
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,060
I'm going to make them a little bit smaller as well.

2220
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:21,180
That should be a better viewing experience.

2221
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:24,300
Sorry for doing this an hour and a half into the stream.

2222
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:25,720
Wait.

2223
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,820
Why is it like sized like that?

2224
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:28,920
Hmm.

2225
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:36,860
But then it's cut off.

2226
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,940
Maybe I'll just leave it down here.

2227
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,160
There was a game in the background.

2228
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:49,840
Stop.

2229
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:54,530
Mintotaur Viper size.

2230
01:30:54,770 --> 01:30:55,290
Stop.

2231
01:30:58,770 --> 01:30:59,790
What is this?

2232
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:03,030
I can tell somebody.

2233
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:04,910
Listen to the podcast.

2234
01:31:04,970 --> 01:31:05,610
Thank you.

2235
01:31:07,570 --> 01:31:09,730
If you didn't listen to the podcast.

2236
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:12,890
I was called a viper.

2237
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:14,590
I don't know why.

2238
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:18,190
Anyway.

2239
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:19,190
Let's see.

2240
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:21,450
So one, two, three, four, five more.

2241
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:25,990
I do have to go out because I'm actually meeting a friend later.

2242
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:34,350
I sent them money and they're going to give me some cash.

2243
01:31:36,670 --> 01:31:48,870
I have to meet up with them so that I can get some money so I can go out and do things.

2244
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:54,100
No.

2245
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:55,440
I don't think my wallets.

2246
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:55,700
No.

2247
01:31:55,700 --> 01:32:00,000
So like my wallet was stuck in the same place for like five days.

2248
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,720
And only yesterday did it move out of the United States.

2249
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:10,940
So even though my roommate sent it on the eighth.

2250
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:17,080
So it's been it's been over a week.

2251
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:32,140
I'm so sick of this.

2252
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:33,280
I'm so sick of this.

2253
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,700
I'm so sick of this.

2254
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:44,620
Before you have this.

2255
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:50,020
Well, when they sent it, they said that it that the person at the post office said it would take.

2256
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:53,640
Oh, for those who don't know, I left my wallet at my maid cafe.

2257
01:32:55,700 --> 01:33:04,480
And a little ghosty decided that ghost that stays at the maid cafe with me.

2258
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:06,980
Sent it.

2259
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:12,320
And the person at the post office said.

2260
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:23,020
Uh, I think like four to ten business days, which I was like, oh, four business days.

2261
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:33,540
So I'm just suffering now.

2262
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:58,590
What is this super chat?

2263
01:33:59,450 --> 01:34:00,590
Thank you, Mike.

2264
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:05,210
Yeah, I don't know.

2265
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:06,450
I feel like I can't.

2266
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:12,290
It's so frustrating because I just haven't dim sum for Papa's.

2267
01:34:12,410 --> 01:34:13,910
The name of the song is so funny.

2268
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:20,630
Ten business days would be like two full weeks.

2269
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:25,050
It was actually that long.

2270
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:31,430
I actually feel like crying right now.

2271
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:38,230
Shit, the place is wired to blow.

2272
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:39,450
We're not dead yet.

2273
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:40,150
Detectives.

2274
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:53,030
No, it's so frustrating.

2275
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:01,150
Anyway, let's play game.

2276
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:03,250
Creeping flesh.

2277
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:06,110
Not the cow mooing.

2278
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:18,590
The candy.

2279
01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:19,950
What are you doing out here?

2280
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:22,730
What the fuck are you doing?

2281
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:24,710
I thought I told you to leave town.

2282
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:26,470
Was that not?

2283
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:27,510
I miss my Jasper.

2284
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:30,670
I left his voice box at the strip club.

2285
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:31,070
No.

2286
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:33,130
I just wanted to hear him say.

2287
01:35:34,290 --> 01:35:36,610
I love you, Candy.

2288
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:38,470
One more time.

2289
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:38,970
Candy, please.

2290
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:40,310
Candy.

2291
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:44,530
Couldn't you just buy the software and type what the fuck you wanted instead?

2292
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:47,550
You know my spelling ain't so good.

2293
01:35:48,430 --> 01:35:51,030
Your speaking isn't so hot either, honey.

2294
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:51,970
Damn.

2295
01:35:52,090 --> 01:35:53,810
Don't be so mean, Miss Gunn.

2296
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:54,630
What?

2297
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:55,610
I don't remember her first name.

2298
01:35:55,810 --> 01:35:57,550
I said nothing you.

2299
01:35:57,810 --> 01:35:58,710
Nothing you.

2300
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:00,590
What the hell are you talking about now?

2301
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:06,630
My mama always said if you can't say anything nice, say nothing.

2302
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:10,290
So nothing you, Varla Gunn.

2303
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:13,470
Come on.

2304
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:18,850
Let's get you to the train station before one of those mutants nothings the shit out of you.

2305
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:20,550
Yeah.

2306
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:24,610
Oh my god.

2307
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:26,170
They're so hot.

2308
01:36:28,030 --> 01:36:29,770
They're so hot!

2309
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:29,930
They're so hot!

2310
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:31,630
Deadly retribution.

2311
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:33,050
Deadly retribution.

2312
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:35,310
Nothing you, Minto.

2313
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:36,270
Nothing you!

2314
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:38,270
Nothing you!

2315
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:43,050
That sound.

2316
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:52,150
Who was it?

2317
01:36:52,210 --> 01:36:53,030
Was it Papa?

2318
01:36:56,170 --> 01:36:57,110
Does that come with salad?

2319
01:36:57,630 --> 01:37:00,070
Every time I hear the Papa Caesar, I think of the...

2320
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:03,290
No, it comes with a serving of extreme prejudice and a side order of fuck you.

2321
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:05,950
The memes from, like, Stranger Things.

2322
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:07,750
I don't like foreign food.

2323
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:12,990
Not since that time Papa Caesar force-fed Jasper Chinese food.

2324
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,030
Poor Jasper.

2325
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:15,830
He was shitting all night long.

2326
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:16,190
What?

2327
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:18,770
He knew Jasper's food had to be licky-fried.

2328
01:37:19,150 --> 01:37:20,410
We should licky-fry him.

2329
01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:21,310
What's a licky-fried?

2330
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:23,330
It's fucking liquified.

2331
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:23,790
Oh.

2332
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:27,410
And you do understand, I'm going to eat, Papa Caesar.

2333
01:37:27,690 --> 01:37:29,690
Well, I was wondering.

2334
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:32,990
You know, he did once ask me to...

2335
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:34,730
Sugar, we don't have time for this.

2336
01:37:34,830 --> 01:37:35,570
He's getting away.

2337
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:37,690
Licky-fried.

2338
01:37:38,270 --> 01:37:38,770
Okay, let's go.

2339
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:40,050
Good girl.

2340
01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:41,010
Oh my god, her boobs.

2341
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:43,610
Oh my god, good girl.

2342
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:44,630
Yes?

2343
01:37:45,190 --> 01:37:46,450
Will there be cake?

2344
01:37:46,810 --> 01:37:48,150
Shut the fuck up.

2345
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:51,570
This, too, is Yuri.

2346
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:56,530
Two daughters headed for the slaughter in an abattoir of terror on a night...

2347
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:57,790
What did he ask her to do?

2348
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:00,890
...prepared to be butchered in...

2349
01:38:02,110 --> 01:38:03,150
Creeping flesh.

2350
01:38:03,330 --> 01:38:04,470
Creeping flesh.

2351
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:06,090
Vegetarians need not apply.

2352
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:07,830
Minto is candy.

2353
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:09,230
What are you talking about?

2354
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:14,050
What do you mean?

2355
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:15,770
Here we go, everybody.

2356
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:19,470
I'm tabbing, I'm tabbing, I'm tabbing, I'm tab-tab.

2357
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:20,950
Where are we going?

2358
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:22,390
Oh, nice, I got it.

2359
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:24,650
Oh...

2360
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:31,970
Oh my god, oh...

2361
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:37,250
This is already a disaster.

2362
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:41,030
Not just a shopping cart disaster, this is a Minto brain disaster.

2363
01:38:42,190 --> 01:38:43,070
French, kiss.

2364
01:38:45,610 --> 01:38:47,250
I don't even know you.

2365
01:38:50,650 --> 01:38:53,150
Oh, worms make great pets.

2366
01:38:57,810 --> 01:38:59,370
Someone had a message.

2367
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:01,010
And I approved.

2368
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:06,010
They were like, I must get this message out through this game.

2369
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:14,450
I've talked so much, I've lost my concentration for...

2370
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:15,730
Oh.

2371
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:19,010
For typing.

2372
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:19,550
Barla?

2373
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:21,350
Can I ask you something?

2374
01:39:21,770 --> 01:39:22,550
What now?

2375
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:27,390
Don't you think it's odd how these doors seem to open and close automatically?

2376
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:28,410
Shut up.

2377
01:39:29,150 --> 01:39:29,850
Is it...

2378
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:32,470
She's thinking she's...

2379
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:33,510
The candy is coming.

2380
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:33,710
She's cooking!

2381
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:35,610
Thanks for the super chat, by the way!

2382
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:41,670
Oh, I got something.

2383
01:39:41,930 --> 01:39:42,370
Nice.

2384
01:39:44,590 --> 01:39:45,830
Open it up, love.

2385
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:49,690
She's gaining sense.

2386
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:50,370
Oh my god.

2387
01:39:50,450 --> 01:39:50,930
Oh my god.

2388
01:39:51,050 --> 01:39:51,350
Oh, come on!

2389
01:39:52,090 --> 01:39:52,530
Run!

2390
01:39:53,210 --> 01:39:54,750
Easy for you to say.

2391
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:56,730
Run, run, run!

2392
01:39:57,810 --> 01:39:59,290
Can you not run, candy?

2393
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:00,990
You're not gonna survive, girly.

2394
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:05,190
Candy, please!

2395
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:06,110
You have to live!

2396
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:08,290
Oh, what?

2397
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:09,930
Oh my god.

2398
01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:11,510
Pickled onions!

2399
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,560
Extra life!

2400
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:22,860
Sultry vixen!

2401
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:27,520
Oh my god.

2402
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:32,190
I'm scared.

2403
01:40:32,570 --> 01:40:33,870
I'm getting chills.

2404
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:35,610
We're in a freezer.

2405
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:37,650
Why are they all shaking, though?

2406
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:39,770
What are these 3D models on?

2407
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:40,770
Oh my god!

2408
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:41,190
Oh my god!

2409
01:40:41,190 --> 01:40:41,510
Oh my god!

2410
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:41,710
Oh!

2411
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:43,990
It's a literal attack on Titan!

2412
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:44,730
Oh my god.

2413
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:45,130
Uh...

2414
01:40:47,510 --> 01:40:47,870
Uh...

2415
01:40:47,870 --> 01:40:49,910
What does the fox say?

2416
01:40:51,890 --> 01:40:52,610
Useless trombonist!

2417
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:53,410
Oh, gosh.

2418
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:54,010
I need health.

2419
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:55,550
I'm not doing so hot, you guys.

2420
01:40:56,190 --> 01:40:57,390
I don't know what the sauce is.

2421
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:03,780
Extra life.

2422
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:06,240
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

2423
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,120
Beep, boop, beep, bop, beep, boop, beep.

2424
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:08,400
Oh!

2425
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:11,560
I don't...

2426
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:12,360
Oh, Liz lost.

2427
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:13,040
I don't know how...

2428
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:17,220
Too many E's!

2429
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:17,600
Oh!

2430
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:18,220
Oh!

2431
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:19,820
Oh!

2432
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:23,930
Too many!

2433
01:41:25,070 --> 01:41:29,300
Got attack on Titan at will.

2434
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:30,380
We're not getting out this way.

2435
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:34,260
Why are these bodies... avert your eyes!

2436
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:34,700
Why?

2437
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:37,880
Why are these guys in the freezer, by the way?

2438
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:42,320
Why are there human bodies?

2439
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,640
You is breathing.

2440
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:48,020
Oh, no!

2441
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:48,500
My combo!

2442
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:53,720
Oh, trepidation.

2443
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:55,340
I'm closing in.

2444
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:55,620
Oh, no!

2445
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:58,640
They chilling?

2446
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:00,220
We're a little hot.

2447
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:05,540
We're pushing through.

2448
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:10,240
Whoa!

2449
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:10,460
Whoa!

2450
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:10,720
Whoa!

2451
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:11,440
It's pretty alive!

2452
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:13,740
Uh...

2453
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:14,200
Giant!

2454
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:15,620
Pretty freaky in here.

2455
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:16,720
Karma!

2456
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:19,560
Malph?

2457
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:21,380
Okay...

2458
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:26,470
Very not alive.

2459
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:27,270
Yeah.

2460
01:42:30,690 --> 01:42:32,290
Your wish is my command.

2461
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:33,090
Oh!

2462
01:42:33,090 --> 01:42:35,570
The T!

2463
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:36,150
Control!

2464
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:40,370
Asshole!

2465
01:42:40,370 --> 01:42:40,770
Asshole!

2466
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:43,770
Why do you have to come out the door like that?

2467
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:46,030
I keep forgetting to do backspace, but...

2468
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:47,090
It is what it is.

2469
01:42:57,490 --> 01:42:59,490
Very nice that they each take their turn.

2470
01:42:59,670 --> 01:43:00,510
I like that too.

2471
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:07,420
Oh my god, please!

2472
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:09,340
Oh my god!

2473
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:10,680
Oh, it's him!

2474
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:12,700
Oh shoot, this guy's gonna kill me for real.

2475
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:13,780
Holy cow!

2476
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,340
Fruit salad!

2477
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:17,640
Yummy, yummy!

2478
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:18,900
Go

2479
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:26,530
to the doctor if you have a chesty cough!

2480
01:43:27,810 --> 01:43:28,890
Fruit salad!

2481
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:30,870
Yummy, yummy!

2482
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:33,250
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy!

2483
01:43:33,490 --> 01:43:34,710
Fruit salad!

2484
01:43:35,670 --> 01:43:36,110
I don't wanna die!

2485
01:43:37,690 --> 01:43:38,950
How are you still...

2486
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:39,770
Om nom nom!

2487
01:43:39,930 --> 01:43:41,070
How are you still alive though?

2488
01:43:41,310 --> 01:43:43,150
How are you still alive in here?

2489
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:44,670
Girl, get out, please!

2490
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:47,150
She's walking towards the zombies!

2491
01:43:49,450 --> 01:43:49,890
Oh!

2492
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:52,450
Oh my god!

2493
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:53,090
Oh!

2494
01:43:53,290 --> 01:43:53,730
Oh!

2495
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:56,170
These are hard!

2496
01:43:56,350 --> 01:43:56,930
These are hard!

2497
01:43:58,310 --> 01:43:58,750
Oh,

2498
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:03,690
he got some health though.

2499
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:04,470
Nice, nice, nice.

2500
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:12,490
Matorakann!

2501
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:17,830
I always knew you were a zombie...

2502
01:44:19,330 --> 01:44:19,770
HG!

2503
01:44:19,930 --> 01:44:20,570
Oh my god!

2504
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:21,910
I thought I finished it!

2505
01:44:22,010 --> 01:44:22,590
Oh my god!

2506
01:44:23,610 --> 01:44:24,050
F!

2507
01:44:24,450 --> 01:44:25,730
I thought I finished it.

2508
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:26,590
No, it's my fault.

2509
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:27,630
F!

2510
01:44:28,410 --> 01:44:29,030
What the?

2511
01:44:29,110 --> 01:44:29,890
What the hell was that?

2512
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:33,590
It's gone.

2513
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:49,650
It's just girl rot.

2514
01:44:50,930 --> 01:44:51,450
Bingo!

2515
01:44:51,610 --> 01:44:52,430
Fat wings!

2516
01:44:52,830 --> 01:44:54,010
One, two, three!

2517
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:57,170
Why did I do an S there?

2518
01:44:57,310 --> 01:44:58,030
I'm so silly.

2519
01:44:59,150 --> 01:45:02,670
My accuracy... my score is not gonna be very good this time, you guys.

2520
01:45:02,730 --> 01:45:03,670
I'm just gonna say.

2521
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:11,130
Play, grit, bow!

2522
01:45:13,270 --> 01:45:15,350
One, two, three, shizumiya!

2523
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:17,070
Made it over!

2524
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:22,630
Oh, I tried to violence instead of violet.

2525
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:26,550
Sometimes my brain just...

2526
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:27,450
What the nothing is that?

2527
01:45:27,730 --> 01:45:29,590
I don't think I wanna find out.

2528
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:31,030
What is... what is happening?

2529
01:45:31,270 --> 01:45:31,830
Oh god!

2530
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:34,690
Oh, just sleeping?

2531
01:45:35,450 --> 01:45:36,690
Pasta face!

2532
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:37,510
A barbarian princess!

2533
01:45:40,070 --> 01:45:40,670
Nice.

2534
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:47,240
Nice, nice.

2535
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:48,740
Nipple madness!

2536
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:52,320
I love the nipple madness.

2537
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:58,420
I don't think humor has a U in it, does it?

2538
01:46:02,410 --> 01:46:04,250
The music is spooky now.

2539
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:05,110
Spooky now.

2540
01:46:06,890 --> 01:46:08,090
Her haircut.

2541
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:16,500
British humor does.

2542
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
This is...

2543
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,120
Gatekeeper.

2544
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:29,960
This is no British game.

2545
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:31,340
Why are you down here again?

2546
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:35,240
Oh my god.

2547
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:35,860
Oh!

2548
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,080
Dang it!

2549
01:46:41,690 --> 01:46:43,530
I was so close!

2550
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:49,260
No!

2551
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:54,280
It's the P. It was hard to type with my pinky.

2552
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:55,880
Where are we going?

2553
01:46:56,820 --> 01:46:58,660
We're getting birthed, you guys.

2554
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:04,800
Oh my!

2555
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:06,000
What's that?

2556
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:06,980
Statch!

2557
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:09,200
Teeny hands.

2558
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:10,640
I know!

2559
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:11,240
It's hard!

2560
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:12,960
That's why I had to stop playing the guitar.

2561
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:17,580
It was too hard on my hands.

2562
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:20,520
Oh

2563
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:26,110
my god.

2564
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:27,070
I can't even let her finish her line.

2565
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:28,010
Meet Katie.

2566
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,940
Now I've seen it all.

2567
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,520
Right in the chops!

2568
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:40,600
Shoot her udder!

2569
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:41,960
Her other what?

2570
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:42,540
Oh my god.

2571
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:43,360
Her tits!

2572
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:44,380
Her tits what?

2573
01:47:44,740 --> 01:47:45,720
Just shoot!

2574
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:46,400
Shoot her!

2575
01:47:46,820 --> 01:47:47,980
Kangaroo surprise!

2576
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:51,080
Oh, no.

2577
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:51,620
I missed it.

2578
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:53,360
Oh, no.

2579
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:54,480
My.

2580
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:54,620
My.

2581
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:56,260
My eyes are up here, baby!

2582
01:47:58,640 --> 01:47:59,840
Oh my goodness.

2583
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:02,840
I love...

2584
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,960
I love monster...

2585
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:07,840
Girls.

2586
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:12,780
Don't call me Daisy.

2587
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:16,620
I wonder if the capitalization really...

2588
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:17,940
If it adds, you know...

2589
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:20,500
If it adds more points.

2590
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:23,720
Sometimes I do it, sometimes I don't.

2591
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:24,320
Oh.

2592
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:24,520
Oh.

2593
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:26,760
I regret nothing!

2594
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:34,960
Okay.

2595
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:39,260
I love monster girls, but this is a little much.

2596
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:43,080
Ah, this is some prime rib, baby!

2597
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:45,100
Oh shit.

2598
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:46,080
Tommy!

2599
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:46,700
Tommy!

2600
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:47,980
That hurts, you bitch!

2601
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:51,780
Oh my god.

2602
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:52,540
Real me!

2603
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:53,340
Oh my god.

2604
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,620
That was hard.

2605
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:59,000
That was really hard.

2606
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:00,140
Holy cow.

2607
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:00,680
That was hard.

2608
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,140
Super doggy bomb.

2609
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:12,180
Uh?

2610
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:14,040
Utterly delightful.

2611
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:20,080
I am reminded of a certain book you read and told about Mato on the podcast.

2612
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:21,180
Yes.

2613
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:22,700
Oh!

2614
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:25,600
Oh my god.

2615
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:27,160
Oh,

2616
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:35,990
movie!

2617
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:37,350
Nothing!

2618
01:49:37,450 --> 01:49:37,910
Nothing!

2619
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:43,000
Candy!

2620
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:44,460
Nothing!

2621
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:45,520
Nothing!

2622
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,740
Is Candy gonna die?

2623
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:49,840
Put it back on.

2624
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:50,060
Put it back on.

2625
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:51,200
Stick it back on, stick it back on, stick it back on.

2626
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:52,440
Candy!

2627
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:00,380
I can't believe she became a pauper on the line.

2628
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:00,940
It's too late.

2629
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:03,540
Feels so weak.

2630
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:05,440
You be strong, Angel.

2631
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,320
Be strong for Jasper.

2632
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:07,780
No, Candy!

2633
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:11,140
I can see him, Varla.

2634
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,560
I can see him.

2635
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:14,400
No, she's not gonna die!

2636
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:17,580
Coming down for me.

2637
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:20,340
It's quite slow.

2638
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:22,700
But they have to be.

2639
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:26,340
Something about health and safety.

2640
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,600
Oh, it's stuck.

2641
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:31,820
No, it's moving again.

2642
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:33,980
Don't you dare die on me.

2643
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:34,920
You hear me, Candy?

2644
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:36,480
Candy's gonna live, I know it.

2645
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:37,100
Leave me, Varla.

2646
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:38,100
Go.

2647
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:41,860
Find Caesar and kill him.

2648
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:43,280
I can't leave you here.

2649
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:44,660
I won't leave you here.

2650
01:50:44,660 --> 01:50:48,380
She needs the voice box so she can hear Jasper one more time.

2651
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:48,940
Jasper is here.

2652
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:52,840
You came for me, Jasper.

2653
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:54,280
That was a good bit.

2654
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:56,900
I love you, Candy.

2655
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:00,600
We can be together again.

2656
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:05,780
And Papa Caesar will never split us up.

2657
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:06,640
Oh my god, no.

2658
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:07,760
Just hold on.

2659
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:08,840
She's not gonna die.

2660
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:10,320
Oh, Jasper.

2661
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:13,120
Will I have my arm in heaven?

2662
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:17,560
Will I still be able to do that thing you like me to do?

2663
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:18,920
Huh?

2664
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:21,000
She talks a lot.

2665
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:22,640
Sweet dreams, baby doll.

2666
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:24,160
She's dead!

2667
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:34,940
This time, Papa Caesar, it's really fucking personal.

2668
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:38,040
Was it because I got below a C?

2669
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:40,880
There she goes.

2670
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,260
Was it because...

2671
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:44,120
No!

2672
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:48,660
I didn't get below a C, though.

2673
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:50,840
No!

2674
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:50,960
No!

2675
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,420
Oh, I almost would have had everything here.

2676
01:51:58,540 --> 01:51:59,960
Why is she keeping the arm?

2677
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:00,480
Wouldn't you?

2678
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:04,100
Wouldn't you keep the arm?

2679
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:08,280
Hold on.

2680
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:10,980
I'm gonna get some more water.

2681
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:12,700
Then we'll go to the next one.

2682
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:24,160
I got these...

2683
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:26,440
I got these Hi-Chews.

2684
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:27,720
You guys know Hi-Chews?

2685
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:29,140
They're typically really...

2686
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:31,020
They're kind of hard, right?

2687
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:33,300
But these ones are like mochi.

2688
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:35,000
Kind of.

2689
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:36,200
They're still a little hard.

2690
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:37,560
But they're softer.

2691
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:40,140
But they're very, like...

2692
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:41,460
gummy?

2693
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:42,180
I love it.

2694
01:52:43,620 --> 01:52:44,840
Actually, what's the inside?

2695
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,640
Is the song's a bop?

2696
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:32,360
I can't hear it.

2697
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:32,860
I don't know why.

2698
01:53:34,540 --> 01:53:35,280
I don't know.

2699
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:38,720
Ooh, I like it.

2700
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,040
Wait, I wanna go back real quick.

2701
01:53:46,580 --> 01:53:49,440
I wanted to see all the stuff that we've gotten so far.

2702
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:51,540
Oh, Candy, I'm sorry.

2703
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:57,940
It says we've been unlocking like 3D models and stuff, but I don't know where to see them.

2704
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:00,380
Seductive she-devil.

2705
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:02,020
Seductive she-devil.

2706
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:03,840
Seductive she-devil.

2707
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:07,980
AI, for some reason, Matara's arm fell off.

2708
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:13,590
Is it under memorabilia, maybe?

2709
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:14,650
Oh!

2710
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:15,670
Oh, here we go!

2711
01:54:18,870 --> 01:54:19,830
Why is she laughing?

2712
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:27,770
But I've unlocked!

2713
01:54:28,170 --> 01:54:28,770
Oh, here we go.

2714
01:54:29,570 --> 01:54:31,150
Oh, I don't wanna read it out of order.

2715
01:54:32,030 --> 01:54:32,110
Let's see.

2716
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:35,210
We've got some 3D models...

2717
01:54:39,810 --> 01:54:40,290
Characters...

2718
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:40,530
Oh!

2719
01:54:42,410 --> 01:54:42,890
Oh!

2720
01:54:43,570 --> 01:54:44,030
Oh!

2721
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:44,730
Oh!

2722
01:54:44,910 --> 01:54:44,930
Oh!

2723
01:54:46,490 --> 01:54:46,970
Oh!

2724
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:47,150
Oh!

2725
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:47,910
Oh!

2726
01:54:48,630 --> 01:54:49,290
Wow!

2727
01:54:57,780 --> 01:55:00,820
Moving, moving!

2728
01:55:03,090 --> 01:55:03,860
She's moving.

2729
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:06,480
Oh!

2730
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:08,420
Flesher.

2731
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:09,740
Oh wait, I can turn him around!

2732
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:14,520
The way he moves is so stupid.

2733
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:16,920
His bootleg attack on Titan.

2734
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:19,320
Wait, let's go back to this lady.

2735
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:20,700
Come here.

2736
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:35,940
Think of the ads you can put on the VOD.

2737
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:39,020
Who cares about monetization when you can see it all!

2738
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:43,080
The monetization is in my eyes, baby!

2739
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:44,400
Candy!

2740
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:44,560
Candy!

2741
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:50,060
I just noticed this.

2742
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:51,140
Oh, I noticed it earlier.

2743
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:52,620
The thing on her leg, but...

2744
01:55:54,180 --> 01:55:55,720
I wonder what it's for.

2745
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:07,530
But there's even 3D models of weapons?

2746
01:56:07,630 --> 01:56:08,330
That's so awesome.

2747
01:56:09,910 --> 01:56:10,670
Oh, yeah!

2748
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:11,710
Look at that!

2749
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:16,310
Something, something engravings.

2750
01:56:16,310 --> 01:56:17,470
No tactical advantage.

2751
01:56:18,170 --> 01:56:18,730
Hahaha!

2752
01:56:22,070 --> 01:56:22,470
Oh!

2753
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:23,730
No way!

2754
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:24,510
It's our ice cream!

2755
01:56:24,670 --> 01:56:26,130
Oh no, it's the ice cream truck.

2756
01:56:26,870 --> 01:56:27,950
Stop, look at this.

2757
01:56:30,430 --> 01:56:31,230
Wait, this is...

2758
01:56:31,230 --> 01:56:32,550
Oh my god.

2759
01:56:33,330 --> 01:56:34,110
Oh my god.

2760
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:36,950
It just gets...

2761
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:37,450
Oh my god!

2762
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:42,430
It gets worse and worse the more I look at it!

2763
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:49,000
I'm trying to read what the ice creams are.

2764
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,160
The ice...

2765
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:52,100
The cream pie deluxe.

2766
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:53,500
Chocolate...

2767
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:56,420
Bubbly?

2768
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:57,520
Jubbly.

2769
01:56:58,520 --> 01:56:59,720
Filthy snowball?

2770
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:04,460
I can't read this one.

2771
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:08,100
The chocolate...

2772
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:09,680
I can't zoom in.

2773
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:10,880
I don't think it'll let me.

2774
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:12,980
The back of this thing is insane.

2775
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:15,580
The chocolate...

2776
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:18,040
I can't read it.

2777
01:57:22,030 --> 01:57:22,630
Look...

2778
01:57:23,650 --> 01:57:23,890
Control...

2779
01:57:24,730 --> 01:57:25,190
Shift...

2780
01:57:25,190 --> 01:57:26,730
No, it won't let me zoom in at all.

2781
01:57:29,170 --> 01:57:30,090
This is...

2782
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:30,890
This is...

2783
01:57:36,230 --> 01:57:37,150
Holy moly!

2784
01:57:37,250 --> 01:57:37,490
Okay.

2785
01:57:37,610 --> 01:57:38,610
Let's keep playing the game.

2786
01:57:39,250 --> 01:57:40,170
That was fun though.

2787
01:57:42,450 --> 01:57:43,970
The scream train!

2788
01:57:46,230 --> 01:57:46,690
Okay.

2789
01:57:48,830 --> 01:57:49,970
They weren't caught...

2790
01:57:49,970 --> 01:57:51,990
They weren't kidding when they said the scream train.

2791
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:54,370
It keeps getting worse.

2792
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:54,970
It really does!

2793
01:57:55,530 --> 01:57:56,430
Oh no!

2794
01:57:56,730 --> 01:57:57,850
We're back at the...

2795
01:57:58,530 --> 01:57:59,050
YouTube!

2796
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:04,740
YouTube!

2797
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:05,520
Don't look!

2798
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:07,920
Don't look at it.

2799
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:11,560
Oh!

2800
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:17,900
Oh, the difficulty changed?

2801
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:18,540
Uh oh.

2802
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:22,620
Wait, can I leave?

2803
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:24,480
Hold on.

2804
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:25,160
I'm gonna leave.

2805
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:26,940
We'll rewatch it.

2806
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:28,620
I don't wanna play on the easiest difficulty.

2807
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:29,440
That's too lame.

2808
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:32,800
That's too lame.

2809
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:35,460
Quit.

2810
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:38,240
Yeah.

2811
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:44,220
I didn't even realize.

2812
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:46,080
Why did it put me on the easiest difficulty?

2813
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,220
I didn't even do that.

2814
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:51,960
Easy mode!

2815
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:53,920
Kimoi!

2816
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:54,040
Kimoi!

2817
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:03,780
I'm a G!

2818
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:07,020
Oh my god, is he gonna say what the G stands for?

2819
01:59:12,550 --> 01:59:13,810
Nobody motherfucking move!

2820
01:59:14,030 --> 01:59:15,450
Paula put the gun down.

2821
01:59:15,670 --> 01:59:16,650
We got him.

2822
01:59:16,790 --> 01:59:17,990
She got it first.

2823
01:59:17,990 --> 01:59:18,810
It's news you lose.

2824
01:59:19,190 --> 01:59:19,630
My brother died trying to take down this sick fuck.

2825
01:59:19,830 --> 01:59:20,730
I need this.

2826
01:59:20,930 --> 01:59:22,710
I gotta do this for Jasper.

2827
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:24,410
Caesar's mine, Paula!

2828
01:59:25,050 --> 01:59:27,430
Papa Caesar, you're under AMS arrest.

2829
01:59:27,650 --> 01:59:28,230
Take him out.

2830
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:28,250
Take him down.

2831
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:29,250
You have the right to remain silent.

2832
01:59:29,530 --> 01:59:31,230
Anything you say can...

2833
01:59:31,230 --> 01:59:32,050
Fuck that shit!

2834
01:59:32,990 --> 01:59:33,850
This bastard can't live.

2835
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:35,670
Wait, don't turn your gun on them.

2836
01:59:35,730 --> 01:59:36,290
He's gonna leave.

2837
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:39,210
Let me contact my agency and we'll take him into custody.

2838
01:59:39,410 --> 01:59:40,510
To hell with that.

2839
01:59:40,850 --> 01:59:42,270
Fucking A, sister.

2840
01:59:42,530 --> 01:59:44,050
Why are you turning your gun on them?

2841
01:59:44,170 --> 01:59:46,610
Caesar ain't leaving this platform with his eyes still open, G.

2842
01:59:47,070 --> 01:59:48,970
Have you both lost it?

2843
01:59:49,390 --> 01:59:49,810
Ahem.

2844
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:53,510
I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint all of you.

2845
01:59:54,110 --> 01:59:55,530
This isn't the time to fight!

2846
01:59:56,830 --> 02:00:01,250
You got the most reason to despise me or anybody here.

2847
02:00:01,910 --> 02:00:02,970
You got the most reason to despise me or anybody here.

2848
02:00:02,970 --> 02:00:03,650
I'm a business expert.

2849
02:00:04,650 --> 02:00:05,550
Urgent business.

2850
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:06,990
What's the backstory?

2851
02:00:07,490 --> 02:00:08,330
What's the whole story?

2852
02:00:08,830 --> 02:00:10,850
You piece of shit!

2853
02:00:11,450 --> 02:00:12,690
I'm sorry.

2854
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:13,970
Do continue.

2855
02:00:14,910 --> 02:00:16,410
See you in...

2856
02:00:16,970 --> 02:00:17,510
hell...

2857
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:18,810
Washington.

2858
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:23,190
Scream train.

2859
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:24,310
Scream train.

2860
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:29,670
200 tons of unstoppable terror burning through the night.

2861
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:31,770
200 tons of unstoppable terror burning through the night.

2862
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:32,950
200 tons of unstoppable terror burning through the night.

2863
02:00:32,950 --> 02:00:35,630
Yo mama, by the sound of it...

2864
02:00:35,630 --> 02:00:37,290
Enough with the kissing competition.

2865
02:00:37,790 --> 02:00:39,230
We're gonna take down...

2866
02:00:39,230 --> 02:00:40,650
Oh my god!

2867
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:51,940
I should have...

2868
02:00:51,940 --> 02:00:53,540
Should have been faster there.

2869
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:55,300
What's her name?

2870
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:55,700
Vanessa?

2871
02:00:56,260 --> 02:00:57,140
Miss Gun?

2872
02:00:57,340 --> 02:00:57,980
Okay, here we go.

2873
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:01,500
Happy birthday!

2874
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:03,760
Crappy birthday.

2875
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:06,840
Like, totally.

2876
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:08,220
To you.

2877
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:11,540
Crappy birthday.

2878
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,100
What the hell is that?

2879
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:14,220
Oh my god, oh my god.

2880
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:19,280
Reluctant...

2881
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:19,900
Oh gosh.

2882
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:20,340
Ouch.

2883
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:21,940
Oh my god!

2884
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:23,980
Composing!

2885
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:26,680
Punch it.

2886
02:01:28,060 --> 02:01:28,540
Swing!

2887
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:30,680
A biggie!

2888
02:01:34,420 --> 02:01:34,900
Swing!

2889
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:37,960
Take him out.

2890
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:39,020
Grab the knife.

2891
02:01:42,260 --> 02:01:43,020
Ah!

2892
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:50,280
This motherfucker is from the county jam.

2893
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:52,140
And that can't be good.

2894
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:53,080
Uh oh.

2895
02:01:53,220 --> 02:01:54,920
Are they gonna be hyper...

2896
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:56,040
intelligent...

2897
02:01:57,160 --> 02:01:57,920
donkeys?

2898
02:02:00,940 --> 02:02:03,080
Better type fast C!

2899
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:04,520
Oh gosh.

2900
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:06,820
Upright man.

2901
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:09,120
Standing man emoji.

2902
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:11,900
Oh my god.

2903
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:13,880
Oh my god.

2904
02:02:16,820 --> 02:02:17,420
What the?

2905
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:18,060
What the?

2906
02:02:25,930 --> 02:02:26,630
Oh my god.

2907
02:02:26,690 --> 02:02:27,310
Oh my god.

2908
02:02:27,590 --> 02:02:29,190
Oh my god.

2909
02:02:33,870 --> 02:02:35,410
This does not look good.

2910
02:02:35,590 --> 02:02:36,570
Oh my god.

2911
02:02:36,610 --> 02:02:37,410
No, not the animals.

2912
02:02:37,670 --> 02:02:38,650
No, the cows!

2913
02:02:39,110 --> 02:02:41,490
Oh my god.

2914
02:02:43,370 --> 02:02:44,690
I was looking at my...

2915
02:02:44,690 --> 02:02:45,750
Sorry, I was looking at my...

2916
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:46,430
something on my...

2917
02:02:46,430 --> 02:02:47,030
mixer.

2918
02:02:49,010 --> 02:02:49,850
Oh shoot,

2919
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:54,440
I got the wrong one.

2920
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:56,360
This is my wedding suit.

2921
02:02:57,800 --> 02:02:58,280
Phantom!

2922
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:00,580
That's me!

2923
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:18,960
It's like sleeping.

2924
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:20,820
Being dead?

2925
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:21,960
Being a zombie?

2926
02:03:26,420 --> 02:03:27,340
I did it!

2927
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:28,120
You guys, I did it!

2928
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:29,160
I did the backspace.

2929
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:30,680
Oh!

2930
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:30,840
Oh!

2931
02:03:32,700 --> 02:03:33,140
Okay.

2932
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:41,040
Oh, what a plan.

2933
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,180
Pick your wish.

2934
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:47,140
How did they come up with these, I wonder?

2935
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:47,780
So funny.

2936
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:49,500
Nice dodge.

2937
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:52,900
Trick or treat!

2938
02:03:54,980 --> 02:03:56,560
Can't wait for Halloween, you guys.

2939
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:57,260
I'm so excited.

2940
02:03:58,220 --> 02:03:58,660
Jump!

2941
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:05,900
Oh god.

2942
02:04:06,820 --> 02:04:07,980
Thoroughly thoughtful.

2943
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:09,080
Thank god.

2944
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:09,500
Oh god.

2945
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:13,680
Oh, thank god I had to slow down on those.

2946
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:14,000
Oh, thank god I had to slow down on those.

2947
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,100
I would not have made it.

2948
02:04:16,540 --> 02:04:17,020
J!

2949
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:17,760
You!

2950
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:19,400
American Dream!

2951
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:22,920
Got him.

2952
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:23,680
Nice.

2953
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:24,340
Got him.

2954
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:24,340
Nice.

2955
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:28,160
Can't wait for Halloween!

2956
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:29,860
Can't wait for Halloween!

2957
02:04:33,450 --> 02:04:34,370
We got something.

2958
02:04:36,750 --> 02:04:38,250
What is going on?

2959
02:04:38,590 --> 02:04:39,490
What is going on?

2960
02:04:39,490 --> 02:04:40,170
What is that?

2961
02:04:40,410 --> 02:04:41,790
Did you miss me?

2962
02:04:41,890 --> 02:04:42,370
Did you miss me?

2963
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:42,610
Hahaha.

2964
02:04:43,850 --> 02:04:46,050
Now this is my kind of place.

2965
02:04:46,790 --> 02:04:48,270
Traveling in style, baby.

2966
02:04:49,410 --> 02:04:49,950
Wow.

2967
02:04:50,810 --> 02:04:51,350
Wow!

2968
02:04:51,670 --> 02:04:55,390
This is like the very naughty boy!

2969
02:04:58,470 --> 02:05:01,170
This is like the, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2970
02:05:02,370 --> 02:05:03,450
Yeah, aggressive!

2971
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:06,630
This is the first class!

2972
02:05:07,730 --> 02:05:09,030
First class babies!

2973
02:05:10,110 --> 02:05:11,490
First class babies!

2974
02:05:11,490 --> 02:05:13,030
Oh, sorry.

2975
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:13,870
Shit, man!

2976
02:05:14,570 --> 02:05:15,290
Eww!

2977
02:05:15,450 --> 02:05:17,950
Where were the ladies on the wall?

2978
02:05:18,250 --> 02:05:19,010
Naked ladies!

2979
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:31,460
Winter is coming!

2980
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:32,180
Winter

2981
02:05:37,390 --> 02:05:38,170
is coming!

2982
02:05:38,170 --> 02:05:39,130
Dry your eyes.

2983
02:05:39,470 --> 02:05:39,910
Dry your eyes.

2984
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:40,470
Woah.

2985
02:05:41,130 --> 02:05:42,270
Oh my goodness.

2986
02:05:42,890 --> 02:05:45,050
You're so violent, you guys.

2987
02:05:47,570 --> 02:05:49,590
Did I wake you?

2988
02:05:49,770 --> 02:05:50,050
Did I wake you?

2989
02:05:51,790 --> 02:05:52,270
Haha.

2990
02:05:56,330 --> 02:06:00,090
These are, these props, or prompts are so funny.

2991
02:06:02,650 --> 02:06:06,350
I like the ones that like kind of make the zombies seem like they're aware.

2992
02:06:07,330 --> 02:06:07,810
Oh.

2993
02:06:09,510 --> 02:06:13,170
Like the one, the one that was just like the zombie unification, whatever.

2994
02:06:13,990 --> 02:06:14,470
Oh.

2995
02:06:15,290 --> 02:06:15,770
Ah!

2996
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:24,420
Thief jerky!

2997
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:25,200
Haha.

2998
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:27,900
Oh, these seats are nice.

2999
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:31,100
I've always wanted to go on a train ride like this.

3000
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:32,340
Oh my god, oh my god.

3001
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:34,700
Why?

3002
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:39,960
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

3003
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:42,340
I can't spell.

3004
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:43,400
I don't know all these...

3005
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:44,660
I don't know these words.

3006
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:48,540
With zombies?

3007
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:49,140
Maybe.

3008
02:06:50,380 --> 02:06:53,300
I wanna go on like a murder oriented...

3009
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:53,940
Express.

3010
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:57,280
I wouldn't have no ticket.

3011
02:06:57,420 --> 02:06:57,780
Yeah!

3012
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:02,160
No, no, no, no, no!

3013
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:03,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3014
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:04,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3015
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:05,260
Taco!

3016
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:08,940
Some old guy ran through here and these monsters didn't even touch him.

3017
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:09,260
Oh.

3018
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:11,600
Papa.

3019
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:15,320
Papa, I want to play video games.

3020
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:19,180
Papa, I want to play video games.

3021
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:20,120
Haha.

3022
02:07:20,120 --> 02:07:20,560
Hahaha.

3023
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:26,000
What does that mean?

3024
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:29,200
Taco.

3025
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:31,080
Oh my gosh, and then wandering taco!

3026
02:07:31,700 --> 02:07:32,760
It was fate!

3027
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:34,120
Wah.

3028
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:36,040
Wah.

3029
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:44,640
What a kill-thrill.

3030
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:51,140
Nice.

3031
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:52,760
There we go, baby.

3032
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:01,440
Holy moly.

3033
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:02,120
Oh.

3034
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:07,700
Oh.

3035
02:08:08,060 --> 02:08:08,680
Oh shit.

3036
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:10,280
I need a bigger boat!

3037
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:14,940
The music's all freaky now.

3038
02:08:17,100 --> 02:08:18,100
Oh, never mind.

3039
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:22,120
Boom, bang, eat!

3040
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:23,460
Boom, bang,

3041
02:08:30,230 --> 02:08:30,570
eat!

3042
02:08:30,590 --> 02:08:30,910
Boom, bang, eat!

3043
02:08:30,910 --> 02:08:31,670
I hate these ones.

3044
02:08:34,210 --> 02:08:34,890
Nice.

3045
02:08:34,910 --> 02:08:36,330
What a fucking waste!

3046
02:08:36,930 --> 02:08:38,250
You are...

3047
02:08:38,250 --> 02:08:40,030
Stop insulting me!

3048
02:08:40,130 --> 02:08:41,290
This game is so mean.

3049
02:08:43,010 --> 02:08:43,650
Hahaha.

3050
02:08:46,230 --> 02:08:48,470
This game is so mean.

3051
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:51,110
Hahaha.

3052
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:00,560
Nice.

3053
02:09:02,820 --> 02:09:03,460
Okay.

3054
02:09:03,620 --> 02:09:04,720
We're slow motion.

3055
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:05,080
That's okay.

3056
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:10,040
Get

3057
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:30,280
this guy some soup, man.

3058
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:33,040
This game need a hug.

3059
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:35,880
Yeah, they insulted me and then...

3060
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:38,580
This isn't a costume, this is my work uniform!

3061
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:46,080
I think we've got all the authority we need right here.

3062
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:46,720
Right here.

3063
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:50,160
My right hand and my left hand.

3064
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:52,580
Get your claws out of my motherfucking face!

3065
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:54,240
Yeah!

3066
02:09:56,620 --> 02:09:57,880
Oh my god.

3067
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:58,380
Oh my god.

3068
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:03,020
What are you doing on this train?

3069
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:05,080
Ding-dong!

3070
02:10:05,220 --> 02:10:05,320
Ding-dong!

3071
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:12,760
Counter attack.

3072
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:13,580
Mint is cute.

3073
02:10:15,120 --> 02:10:15,620
Oh!

3074
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:18,000
This looks like a control panel.

3075
02:10:18,180 --> 02:10:18,780
Don't touch that.

3076
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:21,300
We've got enough problem without these guys getting out.

3077
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:22,400
What are they doing in here?

3078
02:10:22,700 --> 02:10:23,940
Limpa is lettuce.

3079
02:10:25,220 --> 02:10:25,720
Oh!

3080
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:29,420
I'm gonna start it.

3081
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:32,360
Limpa is lettuce.

3082
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:34,780
Oh shit.

3083
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:36,980
My combo.

3084
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:38,480
Two up, two down.

3085
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:39,880
Okay.

3086
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:47,920
Oh my god.

3087
02:10:50,230 --> 02:10:51,710
Okay, I'm starting to...

3088
02:10:52,710 --> 02:10:54,510
Strike your out!

3089
02:10:55,390 --> 02:10:55,990
Baby!

3090
02:10:59,050 --> 02:11:00,510
Oh no, they're starting to get out!

3091
02:11:00,650 --> 02:11:01,390
They're starting to get loose!

3092
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:07,160
Oh...

3093
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:09,500
Oh...

3094
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:10,120
Oh...

3095
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,420
Why are you so mean?

3096
02:11:17,660 --> 02:11:18,320
No...

3097
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:19,280
Holy shit!

3098
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:20,780
Christmas came early!

3099
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:21,280
Let's go.

3100
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:21,980
Oh!

3101
02:11:23,100 --> 02:11:23,840
That's me.

3102
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:24,740
I'm a niche appeal.

3103
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:30,240
Motherfuck!

3104
02:11:30,660 --> 02:11:30,980
Oi!

3105
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:34,000
That was close.

3106
02:11:35,250 --> 02:11:35,880
Up we go!

3107
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:38,380
What's been going on here?

3108
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:39,860
Hmm...

3109
02:11:40,120 --> 02:11:40,480
Ugh!

3110
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:43,220
Extreme violence.

3111
02:11:43,460 --> 02:11:44,460
What was that?

3112
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:49,640
Word list is brutal, I know.

3113
02:11:50,260 --> 02:11:51,560
This is your driver.

3114
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:52,060
Papa!

3115
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:57,200
I'm pleased to announce, we're running ahead of schedule.

3116
02:11:57,620 --> 02:12:03,960
And we'll be reaching our final destination far, far sooner than expected.

3117
02:12:04,460 --> 02:12:04,880
Uh oh.

3118
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:05,220
Well...

3119
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:17,040
Choo-choo, everybody!

3120
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:21,140
Perfect time to use my choo-choo emote.

3121
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:24,680
You ain't protecting your papa this time, you bug motherfucker!

3122
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:25,820
I'm a Tarakhan!

3123
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:26,780
Kids today!

3124
02:12:27,460 --> 02:12:28,480
Kids tomorrow!

3125
02:12:29,560 --> 02:12:30,440
Oh my god.

3126
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:31,460
I wonder what the...

3127
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:36,300
What the secret's gonna be for like, you know...

3128
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:37,640
Wheeee!

3129
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:42,220
April Fools!

3130
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:43,420
April Fools!

3131
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:45,500
Choo-choo!

3132
02:12:52,180 --> 02:12:53,060
Oh gosh!

3133
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:54,440
Don't you know it's rude to spit?

3134
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:55,780
Oh my god!

3135
02:12:55,880 --> 02:12:56,720
Oh my god!

3136
02:12:56,900 --> 02:12:57,920
Oh no no no no!

3137
02:12:58,260 --> 02:12:59,900
Oh no no no!

3138
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:01,260
We're introducing Numbers!

3139
02:13:05,580 --> 02:13:06,660
We're introducing Numbers!

3140
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:07,880
Oh.

3141
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:33,960
Numbers hate.

3142
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:35,480
Yeah.

3143
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:37,860
Here she comes!

3144
02:13:39,140 --> 02:13:39,540
Centrical!

3145
02:13:41,740 --> 02:13:42,140
Here

3146
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:49,470
we go, Numbers!

3147
02:13:56,850 --> 02:13:57,650
Oh cute!

3148
02:13:59,030 --> 02:13:59,430
Nice!

3149
02:14:06,100 --> 02:14:06,500
Oh!

3150
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:07,640
Oh, never mind, never mind.

3151
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:12,810
I thought that was it.

3152
02:14:12,870 --> 02:14:13,390
I thought that was it.

3153
02:14:13,510 --> 02:14:14,470
What the...

3154
02:14:14,930 --> 02:14:15,330
I got

3155
02:14:18,910 --> 02:14:19,430
both eyes!

3156
02:14:21,730 --> 02:14:22,470
Is that it?

3157
02:14:24,530 --> 02:14:26,230
I think we ran it over, right?

3158
02:14:26,230 --> 02:14:27,450
It just fell off the...

3159
02:14:32,690 --> 02:14:34,490
Oh, we're on the...

3160
02:14:34,490 --> 02:14:36,830
That shit's ick!

3161
02:14:36,830 --> 02:14:39,070
Guys, we're on the highway to hell right now.

3162
02:14:39,370 --> 02:14:39,610
Are you kidding me?

3163
02:14:39,610 --> 02:14:40,570
Alright, Rambo.

3164
02:14:40,710 --> 02:14:42,450
Don't get all fucking macho.

3165
02:14:42,470 --> 02:14:43,570
I hate bugs.

3166
02:14:43,790 --> 02:14:45,770
And that was their fucking bug king.

3167
02:14:46,290 --> 02:14:48,330
And speaking of bugs...

3168
02:14:49,310 --> 02:14:50,450
Speaking of bugs?

3169
02:14:50,650 --> 02:14:51,690
You fucking in there?

3170
02:14:52,570 --> 02:14:53,770
Yoo-hoo!

3171
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:54,970
Yoo-hoo!

3172
02:14:54,970 --> 02:14:56,670
Yoo -hoo!

3173
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,260
Still a C?

3174
02:15:07,660 --> 02:15:08,800
Come on!

3175
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,100
Come on, game!

3176
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:12,720
I got a C after...

3177
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:14,900
I don't think I did that poorly, right?

3178
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:17,600
I guess I got no Gorgasm, so...

3179
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:18,780
No!

3180
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:21,960
I got a C.

3181
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:24,320
It was too slow.

3182
02:15:24,820 --> 02:15:26,660
It wasn't slow, it was...

3183
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:28,180
Accuracy, right?

3184
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:35,420
Nearly 97% though.

3185
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:36,080
Yeah.

3186
02:15:38,300 --> 02:15:40,860
Am I proving my O-L-ness to you guys?

3187
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:42,440
Daddy, can I be a mutant?

3188
02:15:43,180 --> 02:15:44,160
One day, son.

3189
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:45,600
But for now, you're too young.

3190
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:46,840
But daddy!

3191
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:48,280
No means no.

3192
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:50,100
Stop sniveling, you little shit.

3193
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:51,960
By the way, I'm not your daddy.

3194
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:52,340
Huh?

3195
02:15:53,620 --> 02:15:55,600

3196
02:15:57,120 --> 02:15:59,640
Talking of fucking people, I have a story for you.

3197
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:00,380
What is this song?

3198
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:20,460

3378
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:17,260

3379
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:20,080

02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:29,860

3384
02:34:09,950 --> 02:34:12,490
That gave me a little bit of a... what's the word?

3385
02:34:12,750 --> 02:34:13,530
Motion sickness.

3386
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:22,240
Trust to kill!

3387
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:27,340
There was no way I was gonna get that one.

3388
02:34:28,700 --> 02:34:29,980
There was no...

3389
02:34:29,980 --> 02:34:29,980
oh!

3390
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:33,800
Got him.

3391
02:34:33,900 --> 02:34:34,660
Easy peasy.

3392
02:34:35,720 --> 02:34:37,260
You guys, am I good at typing?

3393
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:38,280
What do you think?

3394
02:34:40,600 --> 02:34:41,720
Am I good at typing?

3395
02:34:46,280 --> 02:34:47,120
Bad breath.

3396
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:48,220
Yeah.

3397
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:50,740
There's no way I'm gonna get this one.

3398
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:51,360
I give up.

3399
02:34:56,280 --> 02:34:57,060
I'm pretty good.

3400
02:35:06,420 --> 02:35:07,460
You're pretty good.

3401
02:35:12,740 --> 02:35:13,520
I'm pretty good.

3402
02:35:13,660 --> 02:35:14,680
Are you winning, Mint?

3403
02:35:14,820 --> 02:35:15,600
Yeah, actually.

3404
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:21,880
See, I was an OL.

3405
02:35:22,440 --> 02:35:24,040
I was an OL, you guys!

3406
02:35:27,020 --> 02:35:28,880
This was my... and I did data entry.

3407
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:32,880
That's how... but I was always good at typing, ever since I was a kid.

3408
02:35:33,060 --> 02:35:33,300
You know?

3409
02:35:35,420 --> 02:35:37,640
You know, the first time... like...

3410
02:35:39,900 --> 02:35:41,500
When they introduced the...

3411
02:35:43,640 --> 02:35:44,520
typing classes.

3412
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:46,120
I was all in on that.

3413
02:35:46,120 --> 02:35:48,900
I did typing classes all the time.

3414
02:35:51,640 --> 02:35:52,720
But I never...

3415
02:35:53,360 --> 02:35:54,900
did anything like this.

3416
02:35:56,940 --> 02:35:58,140
Ah, so close.

3417
02:35:58,420 --> 02:35:59,440
I was so close!

3418
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:07,080
Cheat rate for this one.

3419
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:09,160
I sucked at typing classes.

3420
02:36:09,480 --> 02:36:10,520
I loved it, though.

3421
02:36:10,660 --> 02:36:11,540
I was obsessed.

3422
02:36:11,880 --> 02:36:13,380
It was my favorite class ever.

3423
02:36:13,380 --> 02:36:14,020
Hahaha!

3424
02:36:18,900 --> 02:36:19,500
Ewww!

3425
02:36:19,540 --> 02:36:20,140
Ewww!

3426
02:36:27,860 --> 02:36:28,460
Beow!

3427
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:30,380
Beow mention.

3428
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:31,300
Hahaha!

3429
02:36:33,800 --> 02:36:34,800
Certified nerd.

3430
02:36:39,080 --> 02:36:40,300
That one was close, actually.

3431
02:36:40,460 --> 02:36:40,740
Hahaha!

3432
02:36:46,410 --> 02:36:48,190
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

3433
02:36:57,750 --> 02:36:59,290
Don't call me!

3434
02:36:59,290 --> 02:36:59,770
Dang it!

3435
02:36:59,910 --> 02:37:00,290
Hahaha!

3436
02:37:03,270 --> 02:37:03,870
Just a few more!

3437
02:37:03,970 --> 02:37:04,510
Just a few more!

3438
02:37:04,750 --> 02:37:05,630
Maybe one more.

3439
02:37:08,130 --> 02:37:09,290
After this, right?

3440
02:37:09,670 --> 02:37:10,490
Here we...

3441
02:37:10,490 --> 02:37:11,470
Excuse me!

3442
02:37:16,740 --> 02:37:17,660
Maybe right here?

3443
02:37:17,820 --> 02:37:18,180
Oh.

3444
02:37:18,480 --> 02:37:19,100
One more?

3445
02:37:20,540 --> 02:37:21,020
Right...

3446
02:37:23,880 --> 02:37:25,060
What in the scum?

3447
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:25,660
Hahaha!

3448
02:37:27,420 --> 02:37:28,400
Woo-woo-woo!

3449
02:37:30,540 --> 02:37:31,680
Thanks for the super time!

3450
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:33,080
So nice meeting you at Vexpo.

3451
02:37:33,300 --> 02:37:34,120
Thank you!

3452
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:35,940
Oh, this is my Oshii shirt!

3453
02:37:36,140 --> 02:37:36,420
Hahaha!

3454
02:37:39,700 --> 02:37:40,580
You're all good!

3455
02:37:40,900 --> 02:37:43,020
I think I spilled the most spaghetti.

3456
02:37:43,220 --> 02:37:43,520
Don't worry.

3457
02:37:43,660 --> 02:37:44,240
I'd rather not!

3458
02:37:44,400 --> 02:37:45,180
Thanks for the five gifted.

3459
02:37:45,220 --> 02:37:45,660
Thank you!

3460
02:37:45,940 --> 02:37:48,840
Oh my god.

3461
02:37:48,860 --> 02:37:49,620
All that I stretch.

3462
02:37:49,900 --> 02:37:50,140
Ugh!

3463
02:37:51,580 --> 02:37:52,060
Ugh!

3464
02:37:55,480 --> 02:37:57,540
That was not a shortcut.

3465
02:37:57,800 --> 02:37:58,960
I mean, what were you...

3466
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:00,400
Oh, quit whining, you pussy!

3467
02:38:00,700 --> 02:38:02,320
I got us here, didn't I?

3468
02:38:03,780 --> 02:38:04,220
Oh.

3469
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:04,600
Fuck!

3470
02:38:05,060 --> 02:38:07,800
You about to get all country and western on me again?

3471
02:38:07,980 --> 02:38:09,520
Isn't it just country western?

3472
02:38:09,880 --> 02:38:11,720
Is it country and western?

3473
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:17,740
I just want you to know, if it comes down to it, I won't stand in the way of you getting even with Caesar.

3474
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:19,520
I'd like to see you fucking try.

3475
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:20,340
I'm serious.

3476
02:38:20,720 --> 02:38:21,940
I like his glasses.

3477
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:23,640
I appreciate the fucking sentiment.

3478
02:38:24,020 --> 02:38:25,020
But it's not needed.

3479
02:38:25,440 --> 02:38:26,960
I do what I gotta do.

3480
02:38:27,420 --> 02:38:29,480
I gotta get justice for my old man.

3481
02:38:29,780 --> 02:38:32,880
And as I see it, you're with me a fucking percent.

3482
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:33,420
Yeah.

3483
02:38:33,620 --> 02:38:34,800
And I appreciate that too.

3484
02:38:34,900 --> 02:38:35,160
Aww.

3485
02:38:35,400 --> 02:38:36,460
But we've been through shit.

3486
02:38:36,860 --> 02:38:39,940
You don't need to go articulating every fucking thing.

3487
02:38:40,040 --> 02:38:40,960
Country and western.

3488
02:38:40,960 --> 02:38:42,140
I know you got my back.

3489
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:43,360
That's enough.

3490
02:38:43,960 --> 02:38:44,720
You dig me?

3491
02:38:44,920 --> 02:38:45,360
Aww.

3492
02:38:45,480 --> 02:38:46,400
I love you too, man.

3493
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:46,940
Right!

3494
02:38:47,060 --> 02:38:47,960
That's fucking it!

3495
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:50,600
He pulled a gun on him for them.

3496
02:38:51,140 --> 02:38:52,200
Fucking leave the way.

3497
02:38:52,900 --> 02:38:54,520
Wait, that was a car.

3498
02:38:54,780 --> 02:38:55,560
There's still people.

3499
02:39:00,240 --> 02:39:00,720
A B.

3500
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:03,400
I got a B this time, you guys.

3501
02:39:04,100 --> 02:39:09,560
I keep getting all the civilians and the comics and the figurines and everything, so we're doing well.

3502
02:39:09,800 --> 02:39:12,520
I even Gorgasmed for 110 seconds!

3503
02:39:13,500 --> 02:39:14,880
Hold on, I need more water.

3504
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:15,620
I'm so sorry.

3505
02:39:15,860 --> 02:39:17,520
My throat is starting to get a little icky.

3506
02:39:18,900 --> 02:39:19,600
Give me a second.

3507
02:39:30,750 --> 02:39:32,310
I have some cough drops too.

3508
02:39:32,890 --> 02:39:36,030
But with all this water I'm drinking, I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom soon.

3509
02:39:38,070 --> 02:39:39,670
Good place to stop if you need a break?

3510
02:39:39,870 --> 02:39:40,470
No, we're almost.

3511
02:39:40,670 --> 02:39:41,670
How much do we have more?

3512
02:39:41,670 --> 02:39:42,630
Three levels?

3513
02:39:45,550 --> 02:39:46,410
Oh!

3514
02:39:46,610 --> 02:39:47,970
Two levels left!

3515
02:39:49,770 --> 02:39:51,590
Beauty was her crime.

3516
02:39:51,730 --> 02:39:52,530
Her sentence?

3517
02:39:52,810 --> 02:39:53,990
Worse than death.

3518
02:40:04,290 --> 02:40:07,950
Wow, it's already been almost three hours.

3519
02:40:07,950 --> 02:40:11,550
Ladies and gentlemen, the infinite tact of Isaac Washington.

3520
02:40:11,750 --> 02:40:15,330
I'm making... I'm eating my cough drops.

3521
02:40:16,890 --> 02:40:19,210
I'll be working crew at Mainstage on Saturday.

3522
02:40:20,150 --> 02:40:23,190
So I'll be letting people into your life, among others!

3523
02:40:23,270 --> 02:40:24,310
Also, any quitter on Friday.

3524
02:40:26,290 --> 02:40:28,830
So it's at the same time as another live.

3525
02:40:28,990 --> 02:40:29,550
Oh no!

3526
02:40:31,770 --> 02:40:32,770
But thank you!

3527
02:40:34,030 --> 02:40:35,810
Thanks for working our show!

3528
02:40:35,810 --> 02:40:36,510
Haha!

3529
02:40:42,650 --> 02:40:44,130
Get funky!

3530
02:40:46,170 --> 02:40:47,350
Yeah, yeah!

3531
02:40:52,530 --> 02:40:54,010
Get funky!

3532
02:40:54,670 --> 02:40:54,930
Get funky!

3533
02:40:54,930 --> 02:40:56,810
Dude, thank you so much for the 50 gifts!

3534
02:40:57,150 --> 02:40:58,330
Thank you!

3535
02:40:58,690 --> 02:40:59,530
Thank you, thank you!

3536
02:41:02,090 --> 02:41:05,740
Laying down the law!

3537
02:41:14,490 --> 02:41:15,230
Yeah!

3538
02:41:19,100 --> 02:41:21,720
I do have to go meet up with my friends soon though.

3539
02:41:21,800 --> 02:41:23,340
So I gotta finish the game.

3540
02:41:24,540 --> 02:41:26,100
I'm so invest...

3541
02:41:27,060 --> 02:41:27,880
And now.

3542
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:29,780
What happened here?

3543
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:30,680
I'm so invested.

3544
02:41:30,900 --> 02:41:31,020
Excuse me, sir.

3545
02:41:32,140 --> 02:41:32,660
Sir?

3546
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:35,500
You two gentlemen smell like shit.

3547
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:36,460
What the?

3548
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:43,780
I'm gonna do my very best not to base our relationship on this first impression, but first impressions count for a lot.

3549
02:41:43,860 --> 02:41:44,560
Why are you so rude?

3550
02:41:44,840 --> 02:41:57,600
So if I meet a couple of men who not only neglect the common decency to introduce them themselves, but simply walk up to me smelling as shit, well, it's gonna take an effort for me to get to know them.

3551
02:41:57,720 --> 02:42:01,500
You look like shit, you know, so my first impression's not very good of you.

3552
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:03,380
I'm Agent G, AMS.

3553
02:42:03,440 --> 02:42:05,060
You're Warden Darling, right?

3554
02:42:05,320 --> 02:42:08,340
That's entirely accurate, Detective Washington.

3555
02:42:09,420 --> 02:42:14,020
You see, I'm not the only individual whose reputation precedes them.

3556
02:42:14,520 --> 02:42:17,240
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to piss.

3557
02:42:17,800 --> 02:42:19,200
My dick's on fire.

3558
02:42:19,960 --> 02:42:24,860
I've been on the road for at least three quarters of an hour with a bladder full of steaming hot piss.

3559
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:26,580
Stop, you're gonna turn on my cat!

3560
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:32,620
With every turn of the road in a way that a bladder full of steaming piss tends to... Stop!

3561
02:42:34,280 --> 02:42:35,980
Do excuse me.

3562
02:42:38,660 --> 02:42:42,560
Do you have any idea what happened here, sir?

3563
02:42:42,980 --> 02:42:43,940
Ah, shit!

3564
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:46,900
There you go, distracting me.

3565
02:42:46,900 --> 02:42:49,720
Now I got it all down my left leg.

3566
02:42:50,180 --> 02:42:52,260
I'm gonna look like I pissed myself.

3567
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:56,740
Imagine if I had to meet anybody besides yourselves today.

3568
02:42:57,480 --> 02:43:01,400
They'd be inclined to think I was the sort of man who pisses himself.

3569
02:43:02,240 --> 02:43:04,520
Now that'd be a poor first impression.

3570
02:43:05,060 --> 02:43:05,580
Indeed.

3571
02:43:06,280 --> 02:43:07,740
We ain't got time for this shit.

3572
02:43:08,020 --> 02:43:11,260
With all due respect, what the fuck's happened here?

3573
02:43:11,260 --> 02:43:13,240
He reminds me too much of these videos.

3574
02:43:14,240 --> 02:43:15,260
Mutants, you say?

3575
02:43:16,260 --> 02:43:18,720
Can you fancy I have any idea what you're talking about?

3576
02:43:18,740 --> 02:43:20,100
Ew, oh my god, he's not gonna wash his hands.

3577
02:43:20,740 --> 02:43:23,020
I got a call in the middle of the night.

3578
02:43:23,480 --> 02:43:25,760
I got told there was trouble at my prison.

3579
02:43:25,900 --> 02:43:26,800
I came down.

3580
02:43:26,960 --> 02:43:28,440
And here I am.

3581
02:43:29,240 --> 02:43:30,820
That's the math of the situation right there.

3582
02:43:30,820 --> 02:43:38,420
He even sounds like those videos of the dogs with the really long face and he's just like, riding a motorcycle?

3583
02:43:39,400 --> 02:43:40,860
How the fuck do you know that?

3584
02:43:41,160 --> 02:43:44,020
Well, there's a motorcycle dumped right over there.

3585
02:43:44,420 --> 02:43:46,120
How did you miss that?

3586
02:43:46,900 --> 02:43:50,180
It's like you, gentlemen, have your own cares to deal with.

3587
02:43:50,980 --> 02:43:53,400
I'll be hanging inside to see what's what.

3588
02:43:53,500 --> 02:43:56,520
If I see your friends, I'll be sure to let...

3589
02:43:56,520 --> 02:43:57,920
They're not our fucking friends.

3590
02:43:58,440 --> 02:44:02,980
At least, look, if you see them, don't let them go.

3591
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:03,720
Don't let them go.

3592
02:44:03,980 --> 02:44:06,100
I'll be sure to do that, detective.

3593
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:07,820
This guy is...

3594
02:44:07,820 --> 02:44:09,980
Do not shake his hand.

3595
02:44:10,160 --> 02:44:10,960
I'm so sorry.

3596
02:44:11,240 --> 02:44:12,080
Call me Clement.

3597
02:44:12,500 --> 02:44:12,860
Ew.

3598
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:13,960
You coming, motherfucker?

3599
02:44:14,440 --> 02:44:16,240
Do not sh... Oh my god.

3600
02:44:16,900 --> 02:44:17,300
Don't shake his hand.

3601
02:44:17,400 --> 02:44:18,880
He didn't wash his hands.

3602
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:20,020
Nice voice.

3603
02:44:20,500 --> 02:44:22,100
Why would you do that?

3604
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:27,920
Clement.

3605
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:31,040
Wait, someone mentioned Clement earlier, did they not?

3606
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:33,460
Maybe we should wait for backup.

3607
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:35,840
Or maybe you should grow some balls.

3608
02:44:36,020 --> 02:44:38,200
Ooh, I love Isaac.

3609
02:44:39,380 --> 02:44:40,780
He's always got a...

3610
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:42,640
Oh my god.

3611
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:45,680
He's always got a...

3612
02:44:45,680 --> 02:44:45,740
a...

3613
02:44:45,740 --> 02:44:45,820
a...

3614
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:47,720
a...

3615
02:44:48,620 --> 02:44:49,940
a clapback.

3616
02:44:54,050 --> 02:44:54,810
Snitch!

3617
02:44:55,510 --> 02:44:56,330
Ponzi scheme!

3618
02:45:02,310 --> 02:45:04,270
He set me up!

3619
02:45:04,650 --> 02:45:05,070
He set me up!

3620
02:45:05,750 --> 02:45:06,510
Guys,

3621
02:45:13,020 --> 02:45:14,200
I gained that right there.

3622
02:45:14,500 --> 02:45:14,680
Guys, I gained that right there.

3623
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:17,180
Holy cow!

3624
02:45:27,100 --> 02:45:28,480
That was crazy.

3625
02:45:28,840 --> 02:45:28,940
That was crazy.

3626
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:33,200
Well...

3627
02:45:34,260 --> 02:45:34,820
Earth

3628
02:45:39,740 --> 02:45:40,040
coin!

3629
02:45:40,180 --> 02:45:40,420
Thank you.

3630
02:45:40,620 --> 02:45:43,120
Oh, I keep forgetting the question...

3631
02:45:44,940 --> 02:45:46,120
Tab, I keep forgetting.

3632
02:45:48,680 --> 02:45:49,240
Well...

3633
02:45:49,240 --> 02:45:49,440
Wow.

3634
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:49,800
Nice...

3635
02:45:51,460 --> 02:45:52,020
Waiting for him, guys.

3636
02:45:52,020 --> 02:45:52,300
Tabbing it up.

3637
02:46:00,920 --> 02:46:01,480
Oi!

3638
02:46:03,880 --> 02:46:04,440
Suppers.

3639
02:46:05,640 --> 02:46:06,200
Rainbows.

3640
02:46:07,700 --> 02:46:08,260
Sunshine!

3641
02:46:08,260 --> 02:46:08,500
Sunshine!

3642
02:46:08,700 --> 02:46:10,720
Everything is sunshine and rainbows, you guys!

3643
02:46:10,740 --> 02:46:11,660
Don't worry about it!

3644
02:46:12,880 --> 02:46:14,300
What are we gonna kill him with?

3645
02:46:17,960 --> 02:46:20,600
Everything is slippers, sunshine, and rainbows.

3646
02:46:24,560 --> 02:46:25,080
Actually,

3647
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:32,260
I don't like when they talk over my shooting because...

3648
02:46:34,680 --> 02:46:35,200
No!

3649
02:46:35,440 --> 02:46:36,160
Just us!

3650
02:46:36,300 --> 02:46:36,980
Just us!

3651
02:46:39,260 --> 02:46:42,800
Because I like... I don't feel like I'm... What's the word?

3652
02:46:47,180 --> 02:46:47,820
Hitting.

3653
02:46:48,400 --> 02:46:51,060
If I don't hear it, you know what I mean?

3654
02:46:52,440 --> 02:46:53,400
Kills your flow?

3655
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:54,560
Yeah, pretty much.

3656
02:47:02,890 --> 02:47:04,010
Nice suit!

3657
02:47:05,490 --> 02:47:06,130
KWI!

3658
02:47:08,910 --> 02:47:09,850
Nice suit!

3659
02:47:24,110 --> 02:47:26,350
Is the how in the...

3660
02:47:26,350 --> 02:47:27,310
My combo.

3661
02:47:28,130 --> 02:47:29,650
No, I saw the slo-mo!

3662
02:47:35,630 --> 02:47:36,290
That's me.

3663
02:47:36,390 --> 02:47:38,630
Far too much distress is literally me right now.

3664
02:47:42,270 --> 02:47:43,990
Get me out of here!

3665
02:47:44,470 --> 02:47:45,750
How many of these mutants are there?

3666
02:47:47,330 --> 02:47:48,770
The slo-mo...

3667
02:47:49,450 --> 02:47:50,050
Switzerland!

3668
02:47:55,810 --> 02:47:58,230
I love... I love how they line up.

3669
02:47:58,270 --> 02:47:59,070
They are very polite.

3670
02:47:59,370 --> 02:48:02,550
Is he in jail for forgetting his tickets to the opera?

3671
02:48:03,550 --> 02:48:04,550
How could they?

3672
02:48:06,150 --> 02:48:06,670
Cake.

3673
02:48:06,670 --> 02:48:07,190
Fabric.

3674
02:48:07,210 --> 02:48:08,450
This guy is all into sewing.

3675
02:48:10,370 --> 02:48:11,570
Kill him with the broom!

3676
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:17,480
Nice.

3677
02:48:18,820 --> 02:48:19,340
Okay.

3678
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:21,040
Onward.

3679
02:48:26,890 --> 02:48:27,710
That's me!

3680
02:48:29,170 --> 02:48:29,810
Yes!

3681
02:48:35,210 --> 02:48:36,410
What the?

3682
02:48:37,970 --> 02:48:39,190
Where did you come from?

3683
02:48:44,650 --> 02:48:45,290
Grandma!

3684
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:52,480
Nice.

3685
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:52,740
Shit!

3686
02:48:52,780 --> 02:48:54,960
That G stands for genocide, motherfucker!

3687
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:00,640
Girl, are you good?

3688
02:49:00,820 --> 02:49:01,580
Oh my god, girl.

3689
02:49:03,060 --> 02:49:03,600
Girl!

3690
02:49:04,960 --> 02:49:05,960
Girl, are you good?

3691
02:49:08,240 --> 02:49:09,440
You're looking good.

3692
02:49:14,360 --> 02:49:15,760
Where are you looking?

3693
02:49:16,320 --> 02:49:17,440
Where are you looking?

3694
02:49:18,380 --> 02:49:19,560
Where are you looking?

3695
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:24,200
You know how it is.

3696
02:49:24,440 --> 02:49:30,360
Oh my god.

3697
02:49:35,480 --> 02:49:36,520
Oh god.

3698
02:49:38,740 --> 02:49:40,820
Tell Grandma I love her.

3699
02:49:42,300 --> 02:49:44,380
I thought I was on the wrong one for a second.

3700
02:49:44,900 --> 02:49:46,860
So I exited out of the wrong thing.

3701
02:49:52,360 --> 02:49:52,840
Grandma,

3702
02:49:57,470 --> 02:49:58,270
I love her.

3703
02:50:00,130 --> 02:50:01,130
Shouldn't it be Grandma?

3704
02:50:06,480 --> 02:50:07,960
Grandma, police are real.

3705
02:50:08,980 --> 02:50:11,460
Thank the Bismarck.

3706
02:50:11,580 --> 02:50:13,160
Oh my god, that one was tough for me.

3707
02:50:19,320 --> 02:50:20,180
Okay, nerd!

3708
02:50:20,500 --> 02:50:21,700
Oh, I thought it said hater.

3709
02:50:23,300 --> 02:50:24,460
Be a voyeur.

3710
02:50:34,190 --> 02:50:35,430
Not an angry pig.

3711
02:50:35,890 --> 02:50:36,890
Could have fooled me.

3712
02:50:39,350 --> 02:50:40,170
Looking around.

3713
02:50:40,510 --> 02:50:43,070
Oh, plasma lingerie!

3714
02:50:43,590 --> 02:50:44,390
What did that say?

3715
02:50:49,420 --> 02:50:50,260
Angry Buddha.

3716
02:50:52,420 --> 02:50:53,300
Nerd hater.

3717
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:54,600
I thought that's what it said.

3718
02:50:54,940 --> 02:50:56,140
I was gonna be like, no, man.

3719
02:51:01,770 --> 02:51:03,190
Why were there three things?

3720
02:51:03,230 --> 02:51:03,830
There was just one guy.

3721
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:07,550
Plasma lingerie?

3722
02:51:07,770 --> 02:51:08,490
Should

3723
02:51:28,580 --> 02:51:33,460
be, uh, in the same, you know, area, right?

3724
02:51:40,340 --> 02:51:42,980
Uh, maybe I will, but...

3725
02:51:46,100 --> 02:51:46,460
You

3726
02:51:52,530 --> 02:51:55,110
gonna tell me what the G stands for yet?

3727
02:51:56,410 --> 02:51:57,470
Not yet.

3728
02:51:57,750 --> 02:51:58,570
What the viola?

3729
02:51:58,670 --> 02:52:00,230
And Papa fucking Caesar?

3730
02:52:00,470 --> 02:52:02,610
Papa effing Caesar.

3731
02:52:02,610 --> 02:52:03,890
No shit!

3732
02:52:12,030 --> 02:52:13,290
That's me, actually, right now.

3733
02:52:15,490 --> 02:52:16,290
So slowly.

3734
02:52:16,410 --> 02:52:17,610
I gotta get some food.

3735
02:52:17,830 --> 02:52:18,710
Me and mine.

3736
02:52:19,090 --> 02:52:21,390
Oh la la, he's coming on to me.

3737
02:52:22,150 --> 02:52:22,630
What the?

3738
02:52:24,090 --> 02:52:25,350
He's coming on to me.

3739
02:52:31,310 --> 02:52:32,030
Chinese food?

3740
02:52:32,170 --> 02:52:33,650
I don't know what I'll get for food.

3741
02:52:35,130 --> 02:52:36,970
I have no idea, to be honest.

3742
02:52:38,210 --> 02:52:39,590
What about that guy over there?

3743
02:52:40,090 --> 02:52:41,630
I guess he's not bothering anybody.

3744
02:52:41,630 --> 02:52:44,290
We leave the guys who don't bother us alone, right?

3745
02:52:46,710 --> 02:52:48,430
Ignore this notice.

3746
02:52:59,180 --> 02:52:59,740
Nice.

3747
02:52:59,780 --> 02:53:00,340
Hello?

3748
02:53:02,340 --> 02:53:02,900
Game?

3749
02:53:07,880 --> 02:53:08,940
Lost in Space.

3750
02:53:09,200 --> 02:53:09,900
I love that movie.

3751
02:53:10,640 --> 02:53:11,640
Chewie finger.

3752
02:53:14,660 --> 02:53:15,060
Nice.

3753
02:53:16,660 --> 02:53:18,280
And you went through behind me.

3754
02:53:19,740 --> 02:53:21,080
Why did you come out of there?

3755
02:53:27,030 --> 02:53:28,270
You should have just stayed in there.

3756
02:53:28,310 --> 02:53:29,230
You were safe, civilian.

3757
02:53:30,650 --> 02:53:34,350
Did you see a freak-ass pimp with a hot bitch at gunpoint?

3758
02:53:34,690 --> 02:53:35,090
Sure!

3759
02:53:35,230 --> 02:53:36,470
They came through here just now.

3760
02:53:36,650 --> 02:53:39,170
Some weird shit going down tonight, man.

3761
02:53:39,630 --> 02:53:39,730
Huh?

3762
02:53:44,190 --> 02:53:44,870
What?

3763
02:53:44,870 --> 02:53:46,430
Big wet kiss.

3764
02:53:50,230 --> 02:53:50,910
Nice.

3765
02:53:51,450 --> 02:53:52,930
Tie to the chair.

3766
02:53:53,810 --> 02:53:54,890
Mashed potato.

3767
02:53:55,130 --> 02:53:56,570
Why are you in jail?

3768
02:53:56,950 --> 02:53:58,050
Mashed potato.

3769
02:54:01,750 --> 02:54:05,810
Oh my god, what if it actually dots my password?

3770
02:54:06,470 --> 02:54:07,070
That'd be crazy.

3771
02:54:11,200 --> 02:54:11,960
Oh, dang it.

3772
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:12,140
F.

3773
02:54:12,260 --> 02:54:13,360
Oh, dang it.

3774
02:54:13,460 --> 02:54:14,100
F.

3775
02:54:14,280 --> 02:54:18,120
I never have spaghetti shame.

3776
02:54:21,260 --> 02:54:23,120
The judge was wrong!

3777
02:54:24,100 --> 02:54:25,520
Check his vibe.

3778
02:54:25,900 --> 02:54:26,920
What's in there?

3779
02:54:28,680 --> 02:54:29,360
Larceny!

3780
02:54:33,760 --> 02:54:35,040
What's larceny?

3781
02:54:38,220 --> 02:54:39,820
When your friends...

3782
02:54:44,120 --> 02:54:44,600
Beer.

3783
02:54:44,720 --> 02:54:45,520
Oh, I thought it said bread.

3784
02:54:49,240 --> 02:54:55,360
Uh, fingers... sent to jail because of the crime of... mashed potatoes.

3785
02:54:57,900 --> 02:54:58,660
Oh, stealing.

3786
02:54:59,340 --> 02:55:00,400
Okay, that's what I thought.

3787
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:05,120
Nope.

3788
02:55:05,120 --> 02:55:05,360
Nope.

3789
02:55:10,180 --> 02:55:14,860
I knew... I knew it was gonna be like that where one guy would be faster.

3790
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,720
What the hell is a... What is this word?

3791
02:55:20,360 --> 02:55:23,440
The old switcheroo.

3792
02:55:25,440 --> 02:55:28,760
I live for the applause, applause, applause.

3793
02:55:29,420 --> 02:55:30,360
I did the switcheroo.

3794
02:55:30,460 --> 02:55:30,740
Exactly!

3795
02:55:32,020 --> 02:55:33,060
Uh, uh...

3796
02:55:36,680 --> 02:55:37,360
Oh, that was close.

3797
02:55:42,690 --> 02:55:43,850
I got the slow-mo!

3798
02:55:46,250 --> 02:55:46,950
We got them!

3799
02:55:47,050 --> 02:55:47,450
We got them!

3800
02:55:53,180 --> 02:55:54,120
Skateboarding in public!

3801
02:55:54,260 --> 02:55:55,940
I don't think you should go to jail for that!

3802
02:55:59,320 --> 02:56:00,300
Oh, they're coming!

3803
02:56:05,460 --> 02:56:06,080
Where'd they go?

3804
02:56:06,340 --> 02:56:07,400
They went that way, didn't they?

3805
02:56:07,540 --> 02:56:07,900
Uh...

3806
02:56:13,450 --> 02:56:14,410
Skateboarding is not a crime!

3807
02:56:15,210 --> 02:56:15,870
Oh my god.

3808
02:56:15,870 --> 02:56:18,550
Score one for the motherfucking cavalry!

3809
02:56:18,790 --> 02:56:19,530
Now let's move!

3810
02:56:19,550 --> 02:56:19,990
Let's go!

3811
02:56:20,790 --> 02:56:22,570
Oh my god, they took them all out!

3812
02:56:22,910 --> 02:56:24,030
Oh, not all of them.

3813
02:56:24,150 --> 02:56:24,410
Oh...

3814
02:56:26,490 --> 02:56:28,830
That's not even a good wig!

3815
02:56:32,410 --> 02:56:33,010
Legis...

3816
02:56:33,010 --> 02:56:34,770
I don't know how to spell privileges.

3817
02:56:36,590 --> 02:56:37,190
Pequod.

3818
02:56:37,190 --> 02:56:39,070
That man was very old!

3819
02:56:41,770 --> 02:56:44,030
Fate worse than death!

3820
02:56:47,310 --> 02:56:49,410
It wasn't my wig, it's your wig.

3821
02:56:49,710 --> 02:56:52,830
Man, these motherfuckers need to chill the fuck out!

3822
02:56:54,660 --> 02:56:55,310
So true.

3823
02:56:56,640 --> 02:56:57,930
Whatever you do...

3824
02:56:57,930 --> 02:56:59,230
First offense!

3825
02:57:00,650 --> 02:57:02,770
I don't know how to spell offense either.

3826
02:57:05,690 --> 02:57:08,030
I don't know how to... uh...

3827
02:57:08,030 --> 02:57:08,370
Cheat!

3828
02:57:14,270 --> 02:57:14,930
Okay...

3829
02:57:15,580 --> 02:57:15,910
Oh!

3830
02:57:17,930 --> 02:57:18,590
Nice!

3831
02:57:18,990 --> 02:57:20,930
Over-egging the pudding!

3832
02:57:21,290 --> 02:57:22,610
No, how could you?

3833
02:57:23,610 --> 02:57:24,750
Oh god, they're coming.

3834
02:57:29,010 --> 02:57:31,020
Why is it spelling in British?

3835
02:57:32,820 --> 02:57:33,400
Why?

3836
02:57:35,010 --> 02:57:36,040
Oh, I'm not British!

3837
02:57:38,780 --> 02:57:39,940
The pudding...

3838
02:57:43,030 --> 02:57:45,090
My eyes are getting so dry.

3839
02:57:45,750 --> 02:57:46,330
Oh my god.

3840
02:57:49,170 --> 02:57:50,330
Boys, boys...

3841
02:57:50,330 --> 02:57:50,890
Oh my god!

3842
02:57:51,130 --> 02:57:52,330
Don't be so melodramatic.

3843
02:57:53,910 --> 02:57:55,350
Put those guns away.

3844
02:57:55,350 --> 02:57:56,470
Take a seat.

3845
02:57:56,790 --> 02:57:57,850
Enjoy the show.

3846
02:57:58,570 --> 02:57:59,470
What's happening?

3847
02:57:59,590 --> 02:58:00,850
Sir, what's going on here?

3848
02:58:00,950 --> 02:58:01,630
Yeah, what's going on?

3849
02:58:01,630 --> 02:58:02,710
You're behind...

3850
02:58:02,710 --> 02:58:03,610
That's right.

3851
02:58:03,630 --> 02:58:04,310
Yeah, I have eye drops.

3852
02:58:04,430 --> 02:58:05,310
I'll do it after this.

3853
02:58:05,470 --> 02:58:06,830
I'm behind the whole thing.

3854
02:58:07,570 --> 02:58:08,230
Piss man!

3855
02:58:08,350 --> 02:58:10,310
Me, I'm responsible for...

3856
02:58:11,950 --> 02:58:14,070
Don't interrupt me, detective.

3857
02:58:15,310 --> 02:58:17,370
I have quite a lot to get through.

3858
02:58:17,470 --> 02:58:20,370
Who would have thought that this freak was behind it all?

3859
02:58:20,690 --> 02:58:21,010
You're responsible for all of this?

3860
02:58:21,190 --> 02:58:22,730
For all those dead freaks?

3861
02:58:24,450 --> 02:58:27,750
Well, I didn't kill your dad, Washington.

3862
02:58:28,590 --> 02:58:32,290
Perhaps my esteemed colleague here has something to comment on that one.

3863
02:58:32,290 --> 02:58:33,690
He's got the ball gag and everything.

3864
02:58:34,470 --> 02:58:35,070
Clement!

3865
02:58:35,290 --> 02:58:35,630
Clement!

3866
02:58:35,930 --> 02:58:37,430
What the fuck are you doing?

3867
02:58:37,430 --> 02:58:37,790
Clement!

3868
02:58:37,950 --> 02:58:38,430
Clement!

3869
02:58:38,450 --> 02:58:39,690
This wasn't part of our deal.

3870
02:58:39,930 --> 02:58:42,430
I got the compound refined for you.

3871
02:58:42,870 --> 02:58:43,470
I...

3872
02:58:43,470 --> 02:58:44,550
Shut the fuck up.

3873
02:58:44,930 --> 02:58:48,750
In fact, shut up permanently.

3874
02:58:49,470 --> 02:58:52,230
The... the looking at the camera...

3875
02:58:52,230 --> 02:58:53,050
Oh, shit!

3876
02:58:55,110 --> 02:58:57,330
You were to do that, right?

3877
02:58:57,930 --> 02:58:59,130
To get revenge?

3878
02:59:00,450 --> 02:59:03,590
The looking at the camera and shrugging his little face?

3879
02:59:03,830 --> 02:59:04,330
Ouch.

3880
02:59:04,850 --> 02:59:05,450
Fuck.

3881
02:59:06,030 --> 02:59:08,870
No, I think he's a goner.

3882
02:59:08,950 --> 02:59:09,910
Oh my god, that was so fast.

3883
02:59:10,190 --> 02:59:11,430
That was super fast.

3884
02:59:11,490 --> 02:59:11,710
Look, what do you want with Barla?

3885
02:59:11,830 --> 02:59:12,970
She's not part of this.

3886
02:59:13,070 --> 02:59:14,090
Let her go.

3887
02:59:14,750 --> 02:59:18,710
You're actually quite wrong, whoever the fuck you are.

3888
02:59:18,970 --> 02:59:19,910
I'm Agent G!

3889
02:59:22,230 --> 02:59:23,230
What does that stand for?

3890
02:59:23,550 --> 02:59:24,750
I'm afraid that's...

3891
02:59:24,750 --> 02:59:26,110
Don't care, right?

3892
02:59:27,170 --> 02:59:29,650
I have someone to introduce you to.

3893
02:59:29,670 --> 02:59:31,070
Very exciting.

3894
02:59:31,470 --> 02:59:32,210
What the hell?

3895
02:59:32,410 --> 02:59:34,530
Will you two please sit down, okay?

3896
02:59:35,010 --> 02:59:35,610
What?

3897
02:59:35,730 --> 02:59:36,090
Be polite.

3898
02:59:36,670 --> 02:59:38,550
She's a real stickler for manners.

3899
02:59:38,670 --> 02:59:40,390
I love how janky this game is.

3900
02:59:40,510 --> 02:59:41,950
Oh my god, it's so fun.

3901
02:59:42,390 --> 02:59:45,630
Mother, meet Isaac Washington.

3902
02:59:46,290 --> 02:59:47,890
He's a homicide detective.

3903
02:59:48,370 --> 02:59:49,770
Very good at his job.

3904
02:59:50,150 --> 02:59:51,010
G for grandma?

3905
02:59:52,430 --> 02:59:53,250
I'm sorry.

3906
02:59:53,510 --> 02:59:55,550
I didn't entirely catch your name.

3907
02:59:55,790 --> 02:59:56,330
Agent G!

3908
02:59:56,570 --> 02:59:56,830
Clemmon!

3909
02:59:57,330 --> 02:59:59,550
Where's my medicine, Clemmon?

3910
02:59:59,690 --> 03:00:02,050
You don't need your medicine, mother.

3911
03:00:02,910 --> 03:00:04,250
Remember what I told?

3912
03:00:04,510 --> 03:00:08,850
Where's my fucking medicine, you factless pissant?

3913
03:00:09,490 --> 03:00:11,790
Let me give you some context here, boys.

3914
03:00:12,630 --> 03:00:15,430
I love my mother.

3915
03:00:15,810 --> 03:00:21,350
I bet you boys love your mothers too and would do anything to keep them happy and healthy.

3916
03:00:21,350 --> 03:00:21,630
Uh huh.

3917
03:00:23,050 --> 03:00:25,230
Well, my mother is dying.

3918
03:00:25,550 --> 03:00:26,050
Clemmon!

3919
03:00:26,610 --> 03:00:28,130
Don't ignore me!

3920
03:00:28,530 --> 03:00:28,910
Uh huh.

3921
03:00:29,270 --> 03:00:31,870
And dying really quite rapidly.

3922
03:00:32,250 --> 03:00:33,210
People die.

3923
03:00:33,310 --> 03:00:37,150
And unfortunately, there's only one way to fix that.

3924
03:00:37,990 --> 03:00:47,790
See, the compound that's been turning my inmates and half this county into mindless mutants can be used to sustain life.

3925
03:00:48,010 --> 03:00:48,610
What?

3926
03:00:48,790 --> 03:00:49,970
In a manner of speaking.

3927
03:00:49,970 --> 03:00:50,870
Oh my god!

3928
03:00:50,870 --> 03:00:52,170
She's got small tits!

3929
03:00:54,590 --> 03:00:57,610
Don't use the one with small tits, Clemmon!

3930
03:00:57,750 --> 03:00:59,350
I forbid it!

3931
03:00:59,550 --> 03:01:00,450
That's small!

3932
03:01:00,870 --> 03:01:02,790
Calm down, mother.

3933
03:01:03,730 --> 03:01:05,170
You're insane.

3934
03:01:05,770 --> 03:01:07,750
I'm just a very loving son.

3935
03:01:08,110 --> 03:01:08,250
Oh no.

3936
03:01:08,510 --> 03:01:09,270
Why?

3937
03:01:09,810 --> 03:01:15,050
I'm going to fucking puke!

3938
03:01:15,670 --> 03:01:16,450
Oops.

3939
03:01:17,710 --> 03:01:19,290
Time for your treatment.

3940
03:01:19,970 --> 03:01:20,250
Mother.

3941
03:01:20,510 --> 03:01:21,010
Wait!

3942
03:01:22,230 --> 03:01:23,350
I'd rather not.

3943
03:01:24,770 --> 03:01:25,310
Bye!

3944
03:01:26,130 --> 03:01:30,250
I can't believe Caesar is finally fucking dead.

3945
03:01:30,510 --> 03:01:31,850
Hey, snap out of it.

3946
03:01:31,930 --> 03:01:33,230
We've got to find Varla.

3947
03:01:33,350 --> 03:01:33,490
This game is insane.

3948
03:01:35,110 --> 03:01:35,650
You.

3949
03:01:35,650 --> 03:01:36,190
Who.

3950
03:01:37,150 --> 03:01:37,690
Now.

3951
03:01:38,930 --> 03:01:39,470
Boys.

3952
03:01:40,610 --> 03:01:41,550
He's a kid!

3953
03:01:41,610 --> 03:01:42,310
One last thing.

3954
03:01:42,630 --> 03:01:45,690
If you'd be so kind as to look towards the stage, please.

3955
03:01:45,970 --> 03:01:46,510
Oh my god.

3956
03:01:46,990 --> 03:01:48,870
It just keeps getting weirder.

3957
03:01:48,870 --> 03:01:49,990
How does it happen?

3958
03:01:50,690 --> 03:01:51,890
In this game.

3959
03:01:51,950 --> 03:01:55,970
Between them, 21 counts of armed murder.

3960
03:01:56,230 --> 03:01:56,570
Is...

3961
03:01:56,570 --> 03:01:58,670
17 counts of aggravated assault.

3962
03:01:59,050 --> 03:02:01,770
12 counts of sexual assault.

3963
03:02:02,150 --> 03:02:03,450
Three bombings.

3964
03:02:03,930 --> 03:02:04,570
One.

3965
03:02:05,170 --> 03:02:06,710
I'm sorry if you heard my computer.

3966
03:02:07,110 --> 03:02:07,110
Boys.

3967
03:02:07,110 --> 03:02:07,470
Puppy.

3968
03:02:08,650 --> 03:02:11,630
Fight them in Old Sparky about six months ago.

3969
03:02:11,870 --> 03:02:15,530
And since then, I've been tinkering with them on my weekends off.

3970
03:02:16,650 --> 03:02:18,150
See how you fight them?

3971
03:02:19,290 --> 03:02:19,970
AHHH!!!

3972
03:02:21,290 --> 03:02:22,650
They're ticklers.

3973
03:02:23,030 --> 03:02:25,610
They're ticklers?!

3974
03:02:25,610 --> 03:02:25,990
ughh!

3975
03:02:28,970 --> 03:02:29,970
What the fuck?

3976
03:02:29,990 --> 03:02:32,370
Did they say that they ate a boy's puppy?

3977
03:02:36,890 --> 03:02:37,970
It wouldn't have

3978
03:02:53,160 --> 03:02:55,020
been better if they bought together?

3979
03:02:57,400 --> 03:03:00,120
You guys could have gone after the both of us!

3980
03:03:00,480 --> 03:03:01,160
Brutus!

3981
03:03:01,960 --> 03:03:03,320
Ehehehehehe that's frivolous!

3982
03:03:04,740 --> 03:03:05,960
Oh my god.

3983
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:07,540
Oh, we're hiding.

3984
03:03:13,420 --> 03:03:15,220
Oh, that was health right there.

3985
03:03:15,360 --> 03:03:16,220
But I don't need it yet.

3986
03:03:17,060 --> 03:03:17,540
AWOL!

3987
03:03:22,100 --> 03:03:23,360
Hopefully we come back.

3988
03:03:26,800 --> 03:03:27,280
MMORPG!

3989
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:37,180
8-8-2-3!

3990
03:03:40,720 --> 03:03:42,960
I don't know what some of these acronyms are though.

3991
03:03:43,840 --> 03:03:44,540
HTTP!

3992
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:45,340
E!

3993
03:03:46,860 --> 03:03:47,560
Carlos!

3994
03:03:50,820 --> 03:03:51,520
GTFO!

3995
03:03:51,600 --> 03:03:52,460
Not you, Carlos.

3996
03:03:52,640 --> 03:03:53,220
Sorry.

3997
03:03:58,130 --> 03:03:59,190
Stand by.

3998
03:03:59,930 --> 03:04:00,630
I

3999
03:04:05,840 --> 03:04:07,480
hate motherfucking mutes!

4000
03:04:08,320 --> 03:04:09,020
AWOL!

4001
03:04:10,620 --> 03:04:11,320
Strappin'!

4002
03:04:11,320 --> 03:04:12,280
Strappin'!

4003
03:04:12,280 --> 03:04:13,240
Strappin'!

4004
03:04:13,240 --> 03:04:13,760
Oh my god.

4005
03:04:19,980 --> 03:04:22,440
They set me up.

4006
03:04:22,880 --> 03:04:24,180
I don't think they did, buddy.

4007
03:04:25,720 --> 03:04:27,100
Chain link fence!

4008
03:04:31,340 --> 03:04:31,740
Checking.

4009
03:04:36,440 --> 03:04:37,340
I thought it was shaken.

4010
03:04:38,320 --> 03:04:39,460
Ian, welcome to my mission.

4011
03:04:39,520 --> 03:04:39,940
Thank you!

4012
03:04:42,840 --> 03:04:43,820
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4013
03:04:50,690 --> 03:04:52,350
Okay, check his Bible.

4014
03:04:52,850 --> 03:04:53,810
Are you winning, dad?

4015
03:04:54,010 --> 03:04:55,250
Actually, yeah, I think so.

4016
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:03,420
I wonder what's... we'll probably... maybe a B on this one?

4017
03:05:04,540 --> 03:05:05,940
Tom, Dick, and Harry.

4018
03:05:06,320 --> 03:05:07,980
I think it's also... I don't...

4019
03:05:10,240 --> 03:05:10,940
Dang it.

4020
03:05:11,060 --> 03:05:13,380
I don't do the capitalizations anymore.

4021
03:05:14,140 --> 03:05:15,340
For the most of them.

4022
03:05:15,700 --> 03:05:16,720
Sometimes it's habit.

4023
03:05:18,300 --> 03:05:18,840
But...

4024
03:05:20,140 --> 03:05:20,680
It's

4025
03:05:26,460 --> 03:05:27,300
affecting my score too.

4026
03:05:27,380 --> 03:05:27,620
C!

4027
03:05:27,740 --> 03:05:27,980
X!

4028
03:05:35,830 --> 03:05:36,910
Crazy child!

4029
03:05:40,290 --> 03:05:41,050
He's recharging!

4030
03:05:41,810 --> 03:05:42,190
Nooo!

4031
03:05:43,070 --> 03:05:44,110
Wait, is he getting his health?

4032
03:05:44,170 --> 03:05:44,270
Oh!

4033
03:05:45,050 --> 03:05:45,430
Shit.

4034
03:05:45,530 --> 03:05:46,390
Is he getting his health back?

4035
03:05:48,150 --> 03:05:48,530
Ew!

4036
03:05:48,590 --> 03:05:48,790
Ay!

4037
03:05:57,780 --> 03:06:00,020
What if it isn't Scary Jack?

4038
03:06:04,600 --> 03:06:05,880
Oh my god, am I gonna make it back?

4039
03:06:10,140 --> 03:06:10,900
Final Fantasy...

4040
03:06:12,140 --> 03:06:12,900
War Team...

4041
03:06:13,740 --> 03:06:14,120
ZRG!

4042
03:06:17,580 --> 03:06:19,000
Lost history right there.

4043
03:06:20,440 --> 03:06:21,880
I don't recognize that one.

4044
03:06:44,460 --> 03:06:45,340
Come on!

4045
03:06:50,630 --> 03:06:51,970
In your own time.

4046
03:06:52,250 --> 03:06:52,730
Oh, yeah.

4047
03:06:53,110 --> 03:06:54,490
Oh, yeah, my bad.

4048
03:06:54,930 --> 03:06:56,070
I'll beat your presentation.

4049
03:06:56,750 --> 03:07:00,270
Jailhouse judgment will resume after these messages.

4050
03:07:00,570 --> 03:07:01,670
They look so iso!

4051
03:07:03,550 --> 03:07:04,850
Posing as they go downstairs.

4052
03:07:05,810 --> 03:07:06,370
A B!

4053
03:07:06,650 --> 03:07:07,550
Okay, we got a B.

4054
03:07:07,690 --> 03:07:08,130
We got a B.

4055
03:07:09,250 --> 03:07:10,350
We got a B, everybody.

4056
03:07:10,650 --> 03:07:11,370
We got a B.

4057
03:07:11,370 --> 03:07:12,450
We got a B.

4058
03:07:15,790 --> 03:07:16,990
Blue commercials...

4059
03:07:16,990 --> 03:07:19,810
There's something someone asked earlier...

4060
03:07:20,910 --> 03:07:22,350
Sorry I missed the Super Chat.

4061
03:07:23,710 --> 03:07:24,610
But, um...

4062
03:07:25,170 --> 03:07:26,030
Something about...

4063
03:07:26,030 --> 03:07:27,870
Something about Hennya, I thought.

4064
03:07:28,030 --> 03:07:29,410
Genius that says dayo.

4065
03:07:31,970 --> 03:07:33,190
B for blue!

4066
03:07:35,210 --> 03:07:37,930
Bo-he-ka is bend over, here it comes again?

4067
03:07:38,430 --> 03:07:39,030
What?!

4068
03:07:39,730 --> 03:07:41,350
What does a brother have to do with this?

4069
03:07:41,350 --> 03:07:43,290
I have to do to pacify a bitch.

4070
03:07:43,610 --> 03:07:46,810
I'm telling you, G, I've tried my best with her.

4071
03:07:46,890 --> 03:07:47,570
I X'd.

4072
03:07:47,630 --> 03:07:48,910
Thank you for the doughnuts!

4073
03:07:49,430 --> 03:07:51,890
Thank you guys for all the doughnuts and superchats.

4074
03:07:51,890 --> 03:07:52,330
Thank you.

4075
03:07:52,850 --> 03:07:54,050
...under fucking standing.

4076
03:07:54,370 --> 03:07:56,950
But that is the last fucking straw.

4077
03:07:58,350 --> 03:07:58,910
This...this...wait!

4078
03:07:59,230 --> 03:08:01,570
Is this a reference to, um...

4079
03:08:04,390 --> 03:08:05,170
What's it called?

4080
03:08:06,150 --> 03:08:07,430
It looks like a...

4081
03:08:09,110 --> 03:08:10,110
Evil Dead, almost.

4082
03:08:12,690 --> 03:08:13,450
But also...

4083
03:08:13,890 --> 03:08:15,730
It also looks like Doom a little bit, too.

4084
03:08:23,120 --> 03:08:23,500
Okay.

4085
03:08:23,960 --> 03:08:24,660
Last chapter!

4086
03:08:24,920 --> 03:08:25,680
Let's go, baby!

4087
03:08:27,940 --> 03:08:29,060
I was thinking Doom.

4088
03:08:29,220 --> 03:08:30,020
It does look like Doom.

4089
03:08:30,440 --> 03:08:31,880
Is anybody by the House of the Dead, guys?

4090
03:08:33,820 --> 03:08:35,300
Doom is a reference to Evil Dead?

4091
03:08:35,620 --> 03:08:35,640
Oh.

4092
03:08:38,080 --> 03:08:39,560
I love the split, too.

4093
03:08:45,500 --> 03:08:46,620
Super Soldier.

4094
03:08:46,860 --> 03:08:48,580
The project failed.

4095
03:08:48,960 --> 03:08:57,960
Today, the bunker that was home to these mysterious experiments and the last remaining samples of Formula X lies sealed and hidden.

4096
03:08:58,180 --> 03:09:00,240
Its location unknown.

4097
03:09:00,720 --> 03:09:01,520
Until now.

4098
03:09:01,660 --> 03:09:07,580
Heaven forbid anyone should ever open that bunker and learn of the secrets contained within.

4099
03:09:08,080 --> 03:09:14,120
Heaven forbid anyone should discover Operation Overkill.

4100
03:09:14,120 --> 03:09:15,260
Overkill!

4101
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:16,440
I just...

4102
03:09:16,440 --> 03:09:18,040
I won't let you fucking do this to me!

4103
03:09:18,280 --> 03:09:19,500
Hold still, please.

4104
03:09:20,460 --> 03:09:23,280
This is a very delicate procedure.

4105
03:09:23,940 --> 03:09:25,920
You can't!

4106
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:26,460
Please!

4107
03:09:27,060 --> 03:09:27,640
No!

4108
03:09:28,400 --> 03:09:29,120
Oh, God.

4109
03:09:32,060 --> 03:09:33,540
So how are we gonna do this?

4110
03:09:33,700 --> 03:09:37,780
I figured we'd kill every motherfucker who stands in our way.

4111
03:09:38,780 --> 03:09:39,360
Okay.

4112
03:09:39,360 --> 03:09:39,620
Fourteen.

4113
03:09:40,440 --> 03:09:41,740
Worked so far, I guess.

4114
03:09:42,200 --> 03:09:42,780
Ready?

4115
03:09:42,780 --> 03:09:47,420
I kinda love Clement's character, cause he's so weird.

4116
03:09:51,940 --> 03:09:55,760
He's just so... all the characters in this are so funny.

4117
03:10:01,680 --> 03:10:04,960
This is doing nothing for my elevator-phobia!

4118
03:10:07,980 --> 03:10:10,300
Why are there zombies even down here?

4119
03:10:10,960 --> 03:10:11,600
Oh.

4120
03:10:11,660 --> 03:10:12,280
Uh...

4121
03:10:13,580 --> 03:10:15,220
Jim Reed Comics!

4122
03:10:28,070 --> 03:10:28,600
Oh, God.

4123
03:10:28,680 --> 03:10:29,960
Last level, guys!

4124
03:10:30,880 --> 03:10:31,540
Italy!

4125
03:10:31,880 --> 03:10:32,200
Italy!

4126
03:10:36,540 --> 03:10:37,860
Blizzard Panic!

4127
03:10:40,020 --> 03:10:40,800
That's me.

4128
03:10:41,520 --> 03:10:43,260
Blizzard Panic is so real.

4129
03:10:52,260 --> 03:10:53,760
Dang it, I almost got the A.

4130
03:10:57,060 --> 03:10:59,300
Asteroids do not concern me.

4131
03:10:59,300 --> 03:10:59,860
Thank you.

4132
03:11:00,380 --> 03:11:01,000
Oh!

4133
03:11:01,420 --> 03:11:03,560
Scumbag Billionaire!

4134
03:11:03,980 --> 03:11:05,120
Oh, that one was hard.

4135
03:11:06,300 --> 03:11:07,220
Oh, wait.

4136
03:11:07,320 --> 03:11:07,600
Which one?

4137
03:11:07,760 --> 03:11:09,800
Oh, Shark Infested Custard?

4138
03:11:13,280 --> 03:11:14,520
Improv... Probability!

4139
03:11:14,540 --> 03:11:15,480
Oh, gosh!

4140
03:11:15,780 --> 03:11:18,600
The monkeys aren't working!

4141
03:11:19,380 --> 03:11:20,620
Alabama Slug.

4142
03:11:20,680 --> 03:11:21,980
These ones are getting hard-hard.

4143
03:11:23,460 --> 03:11:24,100
Ugh.

4144
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:28,820
These ones are getting really difficult.

4145
03:11:29,140 --> 03:11:29,400
Okay.

4146
03:11:30,360 --> 03:11:32,120
Uh... W.S.

4147
03:11:32,460 --> 03:11:34,280
Frisky Cake Robots.

4148
03:11:35,440 --> 03:11:36,720
Compromising Position.

4149
03:11:37,780 --> 03:11:40,220
No monkey, no monkey, no monkey, no monkey!

4150
03:11:48,210 --> 03:11:49,350
Yes, sir.

4151
03:11:49,490 --> 03:11:49,730
Oh.

4152
03:11:50,510 --> 03:11:51,150
Okay.

4153
03:11:52,010 --> 03:11:53,030
Keep... Oh.

4154
03:11:58,550 --> 03:11:59,510
Nice, sir.

4155
03:11:59,950 --> 03:12:01,330
Go to your brother.

4156
03:12:03,790 --> 03:12:04,790
They're hiding out.

4157
03:12:04,970 --> 03:12:05,970
And then we're gonna ambush them.

4158
03:12:11,100 --> 03:12:12,060
Gnome Issue.

4159
03:12:13,880 --> 03:12:15,280
Eat my dust!

4160
03:12:17,600 --> 03:12:18,560
It's okay, game.

4161
03:12:18,560 --> 03:12:19,320
I'll be more efficient.

4162
03:12:19,420 --> 03:12:19,880
I'm sorry.

4163
03:12:20,180 --> 03:12:20,720
I'm sorry.

4164
03:12:21,040 --> 03:12:21,900
Oh, gosh.

4165
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:22,560
That's a big guy.

4166
03:12:22,700 --> 03:12:22,920
Oh.

4167
03:12:24,460 --> 03:12:24,940
Nice,

4168
03:12:28,790 --> 03:12:29,090
sir.

4169
03:12:29,390 --> 03:12:30,870
Doom in tights.

4170
03:12:31,750 --> 03:12:32,230
Good.

4171
03:12:35,650 --> 03:12:39,290
This Zeppelin is Inflammable.

4172
03:12:39,470 --> 03:12:40,190
Oh, that one was hard.

4173
03:12:41,830 --> 03:12:42,870
That one was hard.

4174
03:12:47,130 --> 03:12:47,810
Stealth Move!

4175
03:12:53,990 --> 03:12:56,350
Only you would think that.

4176
03:12:56,590 --> 03:12:58,710
Beyond Passive Pistol.

4177
03:12:59,230 --> 03:13:00,490
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

4178
03:13:00,910 --> 03:13:01,710
Oh, my God.

4179
03:13:01,990 --> 03:13:02,150
Huh.

4180
03:13:03,990 --> 03:13:04,690
Thank you.

4181
03:13:04,690 --> 03:13:05,890
You're well-reasoned.

4182
03:13:06,450 --> 03:13:07,110
Debate.

4183
03:13:07,250 --> 03:13:07,910
Debate.

4184
03:13:14,660 --> 03:13:15,320
Flagellates!

4185
03:13:15,320 --> 03:13:16,440
Next to me!

4186
03:13:17,400 --> 03:13:18,060
Beans.

4187
03:13:23,800 --> 03:13:25,180
Back to school.

4188
03:13:26,360 --> 03:13:27,680
Raspberry Fields.

4189
03:13:29,870 --> 03:13:31,060
Why do some of them just...

4190
03:13:31,060 --> 03:13:31,420
Oh.

4191
03:13:31,460 --> 03:13:31,940
Oh, God.

4192
03:13:32,040 --> 03:13:32,820
Oh, God.

4193
03:13:33,040 --> 03:13:33,840
Dang it.

4194
03:13:33,940 --> 03:13:35,160
I did it twice.

4195
03:13:40,120 --> 03:13:40,540
QB!

4196
03:13:44,280 --> 03:13:44,900
Some of

4197
03:14:37,140 --> 03:14:38,940
these are really hard.

4198
03:14:39,280 --> 03:14:40,140
Look over here.

4199
03:14:42,040 --> 03:14:43,440
Look and touch.

4200
03:14:43,760 --> 03:14:44,520
Ex-F.

4201
03:14:45,100 --> 03:14:45,560
Heriot.

4202
03:14:49,700 --> 03:14:51,120
A Moth Mention.

4203
03:14:59,210 --> 03:15:00,310
Why you asking me?

4204
03:15:04,420 --> 03:15:07,060
Things have gotten tricky, tricky, tricky, you guys.

4205
03:15:07,200 --> 03:15:07,560
Oh, my God.

4206
03:15:07,560 --> 03:15:07,640
Oh my god.

4207
03:15:07,640 --> 03:15:08,020
Run!

4208
03:15:13,800 --> 03:15:15,000
I think that was health.

4209
03:15:15,220 --> 03:15:15,800
Oh well.

4210
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:19,060
I'm just traversing tab all the time.

4211
03:15:22,520 --> 03:15:24,320
No one needs you alive.

4212
03:15:25,400 --> 03:15:26,940
Pixie dream, girls.

4213
03:15:32,200 --> 03:15:33,780
Last level you can do it.

4214
03:15:33,880 --> 03:15:34,060
Yeah.

4215
03:15:34,140 --> 03:15:34,740
My eyes.

4216
03:15:34,880 --> 03:15:34,960
Oh.

4217
03:15:36,080 --> 03:15:37,120
Saucy recipe.

4218
03:15:37,440 --> 03:15:38,800
I can't spell that.

4219
03:15:39,840 --> 03:15:41,620
I can't spell recipe.

4220
03:15:42,940 --> 03:15:43,800
Don't give up.

4221
03:15:46,280 --> 03:15:47,220
I got you.

4222
03:15:47,720 --> 03:15:48,240
Chocolate!

4223
03:15:50,940 --> 03:15:51,460
Nice.

4224
03:15:53,880 --> 03:15:55,340
Slow-mo came in handy there.

4225
03:15:55,940 --> 03:15:56,740
I don't think...

4226
03:15:56,740 --> 03:16:02,400
I don't think I would have saved him if I hadn't had the slow-mo.

4227
03:16:02,680 --> 03:16:03,580
To be honest.

4228
03:16:07,180 --> 03:16:08,380
Soapy fighters.

4229
03:16:08,720 --> 03:16:11,180
We are soapy...

4230
03:16:12,240 --> 03:16:12,840
...fighters.

4231
03:16:17,080 --> 03:16:17,680
Fighters...

4232
03:16:17,680 --> 03:16:21,640
That one is evil.

4233
03:16:21,820 --> 03:16:22,360
That one...

4234
03:16:23,680 --> 03:16:24,920
That one was so evil.

4235
03:16:25,320 --> 03:16:26,440
What the hell.

4236
03:16:28,280 --> 03:16:30,260
These are hard words!

4237
03:16:30,540 --> 03:16:31,660
I don't even know what these are.

4238
03:16:32,800 --> 03:16:36,580
The guitar malfunction kind of went crazy.

4239
03:16:36,760 --> 03:16:38,140
What did I just do to him?

4240
03:16:43,380 --> 03:16:44,960
That went hard.

4241
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:46,420
Looks like your computer just crashed.

4242
03:16:46,640 --> 03:16:47,380
Plank stars.

4243
03:16:49,440 --> 03:16:52,120
Hot and warm, baby!

4244
03:16:57,560 --> 03:16:59,460
You're getting on that plane.

4245
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:02,800
Extreme violence.

4246
03:17:05,620 --> 03:17:09,960
Oh my god, sorry.

4247
03:17:10,140 --> 03:17:10,680
This scared me.

4248
03:17:17,080 --> 03:17:17,480
Jump!

4249
03:17:27,120 --> 03:17:28,260
That could've been us.

4250
03:17:28,440 --> 03:17:29,480
That could've been us, man.

4251
03:17:33,640 --> 03:17:35,080
Hear me woof!

4252
03:17:44,080 --> 03:17:45,100
Toboggan warrior.

4253
03:17:47,220 --> 03:17:47,900
Oh

4254
03:17:58,580 --> 03:17:59,920
my god, these are long.

4255
03:18:00,460 --> 03:18:02,340
When two become one.

4256
03:18:05,610 --> 03:18:06,650
Oh my gosh.

4257
03:18:17,460 --> 03:18:20,020
Instant poodles is so good.

4258
03:18:23,420 --> 03:18:25,380
I swear you get up on this.

4259
03:18:27,780 --> 03:18:28,360
Cow!

4260
03:18:29,980 --> 03:18:32,740
It's not nice to yell cow at a lady.

4261
03:18:34,600 --> 03:18:37,500
By the way, c'est fromage.

4262
03:18:40,420 --> 03:18:47,130
It's not nice to yell when a lady comes up at you, you know.

4263
03:18:48,110 --> 03:18:49,190
Why waste it?

4264
03:18:49,210 --> 03:18:49,410
No.

4265
03:18:57,020 --> 03:18:58,680
Argentina mansion, baby!

4266
03:18:58,840 --> 03:18:59,260
Argentina mansion, baby!

4267
03:19:10,440 --> 03:19:11,440
Some of these are so hard.

4268
03:19:11,520 --> 03:19:11,760
Gotcha!

4269
03:19:13,380 --> 03:19:13,980
Minister!

4270
03:19:15,280 --> 03:19:16,100
Who's next?

4271
03:19:16,620 --> 03:19:17,220
Lanto!

4272
03:19:19,900 --> 03:19:21,420
Bump this thread!

4273
03:19:23,280 --> 03:19:25,660
Oh my gosh, I remember doing that on Gaia.

4274
03:19:25,800 --> 03:19:26,900
I'd be like, bump!

4275
03:19:28,500 --> 03:19:29,940
Which one is closer?

4276
03:19:30,320 --> 03:19:32,940
Your shadow has horns!

4277
03:19:37,060 --> 03:19:38,480
Bump this thread, everybody.

4278
03:19:38,640 --> 03:19:38,940
Bump.

4279
03:19:39,140 --> 03:19:39,740
Bump.

4280
03:19:46,440 --> 03:19:46,960
Bump.

4281
03:19:46,960 --> 03:19:47,800
Not the thread, Necro.

4282
03:19:49,220 --> 03:19:51,420
No, it was my favorite place to roleplay.

4283
03:19:51,480 --> 03:19:53,440
And if it was quiet, I'd be like, bump.

4284
03:19:55,080 --> 03:19:55,600
Bump.

4285
03:19:56,200 --> 03:19:56,720
Bump.

4286
03:19:57,080 --> 03:19:57,280
Bump.

4287
03:19:58,400 --> 03:19:58,920
Bump.

4288
03:19:59,200 --> 03:19:59,260
Bump.

4289
03:19:59,420 --> 03:19:59,940
Bump.

4290
03:19:59,940 --> 03:20:00,300
Bump.

4291
03:20:00,300 --> 03:20:00,640
Bump.

4292
03:20:00,760 --> 03:20:00,860
Bump.

4293
03:20:01,360 --> 03:20:01,880
Bump.

4294
03:20:01,880 --> 03:20:02,080
Bump.

4295
03:20:02,080 --> 03:20:02,580
Bump.

4296
03:20:03,100 --> 03:20:03,620
Bump.

4297
03:20:04,320 --> 03:20:04,840
Bump.

4298
03:20:05,460 --> 03:20:06,220
Oh, shit!

4299
03:20:06,260 --> 03:20:06,380
Oh, shit!

4300
03:20:06,500 --> 03:20:07,840
Uh, sorry.

4301
03:20:08,480 --> 03:20:08,860
Damn.

4302
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:10,000
That wasn't me!

4303
03:20:10,480 --> 03:20:10,860
That wasn't me!

4304
03:20:10,860 --> 03:20:11,140
Ten of them.

4305
03:20:11,220 --> 03:20:11,860
One of them.

4306
03:20:12,140 --> 03:20:13,060
Don't feel too bad.

4307
03:20:13,140 --> 03:20:14,000
That wasn't me!

4308
03:20:14,400 --> 03:20:16,480
You can be one cool motherfucker at times, you know that?

4309
03:20:16,940 --> 03:20:18,060
Why did we come in here?

4310
03:20:18,280 --> 03:20:20,380
Shut up and figure a way out of it.

4311
03:20:20,380 --> 03:20:21,300
Why did we come in here?

4312
03:20:21,520 --> 03:20:21,660
The chef, go.

4313
03:20:21,760 --> 03:20:22,120
Now.

4314
03:20:22,380 --> 03:20:22,980
Go, go, go.

4315
03:20:24,220 --> 03:20:24,960
Oh my god.

4316
03:20:25,540 --> 03:20:26,900
We were gonna burn alive in there.

4317
03:20:27,480 --> 03:20:28,220
Oh my god.

4318
03:20:28,720 --> 03:20:29,100
Fuck!

4319
03:20:30,720 --> 03:20:32,440
That motherfucker nearly had me.

4320
03:20:32,740 --> 03:20:33,120
Shit!

4321
03:20:33,300 --> 03:20:34,720
You ever feel like dialing down the curse?

4322
03:20:34,820 --> 03:20:35,160
I don't seem washed.

4323
03:20:35,340 --> 03:20:35,760
No!

4324
03:20:35,920 --> 03:20:36,440
Fuck that motherfucker!

4325
03:20:38,860 --> 03:20:39,740
Oh, hold on.

4326
03:20:39,940 --> 03:20:42,520
Take highlighter is the best!

4327
03:20:43,880 --> 03:20:45,060
Speak your truth!

4328
03:20:47,020 --> 03:20:48,360
Speak your truth!

4329
03:20:50,600 --> 03:20:51,200
Oh

4330
03:20:57,080 --> 03:20:58,020
no, I missed.

4331
03:20:58,140 --> 03:20:58,900
I wasted it, I think.

4332
03:20:59,080 --> 03:21:00,720
Oh my shit.

4333
03:21:01,080 --> 03:21:03,440
This blood is p- working.

4334
03:21:06,200 --> 03:21:07,160
Oh, whoa!

4335
03:21:07,400 --> 03:21:10,700
Wait, those aren't... Is this actually Metal Gear?

4336
03:21:13,360 --> 03:21:14,080
Oh my god.

4337
03:21:17,320 --> 03:21:18,580
Don't give in to hate.

4338
03:21:35,460 --> 03:21:37,980
The socks with sandals!

4339
03:21:38,000 --> 03:21:39,640
Oh, I should have saved the health.

4340
03:21:40,320 --> 03:21:41,740
Filthy nuns!

4341
03:21:44,240 --> 03:21:44,720
Come

4342
03:21:59,430 --> 03:22:00,650
on, let's find the trip.

4343
03:22:01,370 --> 03:22:02,810
Socks and sandals are cute!

4344
03:22:03,110 --> 03:22:04,390
I stand by that!

4345
03:22:06,290 --> 03:22:07,010
Depends!

4346
03:22:07,530 --> 03:22:08,810
What kind of socks?

4347
03:22:11,110 --> 03:22:12,570
With the sandals!

4348
03:22:15,010 --> 03:22:15,730
Lizard.

4349
03:22:17,450 --> 03:22:17,810
Uh,

4350
03:22:30,150 --> 03:22:32,370
waiting for paint to dry.

4351
03:22:32,730 --> 03:22:35,450
Uh, fixing my toasties.

4352
03:22:38,850 --> 03:22:39,650
Oh my god.

4353
03:22:40,630 --> 03:22:43,270
Sometimes they're just all like...

4354
03:22:46,830 --> 03:22:48,850
Sometimes they're too close, but it's okay.

4355
03:22:48,870 --> 03:22:49,690
It's like, uh...

4356
03:22:51,030 --> 03:22:51,550
Oh.

4357
03:22:54,190 --> 03:22:55,470
Oh my god, that was close.

4358
03:22:56,150 --> 03:22:57,470
But they're all yellow.

4359
03:22:57,670 --> 03:22:59,150
One guy is really far away, though.

4360
03:23:00,790 --> 03:23:01,670
It's confusing.

4361
03:23:17,320 --> 03:23:19,180
Next generation soldiers!

4362
03:23:21,960 --> 03:23:23,000
He's emoting.

4363
03:23:27,580 --> 03:23:28,640
Here's the bulkhead switch.

4364
03:23:28,800 --> 03:23:29,680
I'll unlock it.

4365
03:23:30,120 --> 03:23:30,640
Okay.

4366
03:23:33,080 --> 03:23:33,600
Uh.

4367
03:23:34,880 --> 03:23:37,040
A cat dancing detective.

4368
03:23:39,620 --> 03:23:40,160
Got him?

4369
03:23:40,840 --> 03:23:41,220
Yeah!

4370
03:23:44,660 --> 03:23:46,860
Next generation special forces.

4371
03:23:47,440 --> 03:23:48,800
So, where's Varla?

4372
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:50,800
She's right here, boy.

4373
03:23:52,140 --> 03:23:53,920
Varla, are you okay?

4374
03:23:54,260 --> 03:23:54,700
Uh oh.

4375
03:23:54,760 --> 03:23:55,720
Better than okay.

4376
03:23:56,640 --> 03:23:59,460
I've never felt so turned on in my life.

4377
03:23:59,460 --> 03:23:59,920
It's grandma!

4378
03:24:00,400 --> 03:24:01,220
Oh my god, it's grandma.

4379
03:24:01,460 --> 03:24:01,980
Say what?

4380
03:24:02,020 --> 03:24:02,740
Oh my god, it's grandma.

4381
03:24:02,740 --> 03:24:04,140
Don't worry, detective.

4382
03:24:04,140 --> 03:24:04,640
Don't worry, detective.

4383
03:24:04,640 --> 03:24:04,800
Ouch.

4384
03:24:04,800 --> 03:24:05,780
Oh my god, my contacts.

4385
03:24:27,160 --> 03:24:29,920
That's why it said go to your room!

4386
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:30,660
Because of her!

4387
03:24:32,440 --> 03:24:33,120
Varla, no!

4388
03:24:34,660 --> 03:24:37,340
Don't you ever talk to your mother like that!

4389
03:24:37,440 --> 03:24:38,020
Oh my god!

4390
03:24:38,620 --> 03:24:39,800
Sorry, mommy.

4391
03:24:40,200 --> 03:24:41,180
That's better.

4392
03:24:41,400 --> 03:24:41,740
Mommy?

4393
03:24:41,940 --> 03:24:44,200
Oh my fucking...

4394
03:24:44,200 --> 03:24:45,300
What have you done?

4395
03:24:45,840 --> 03:24:48,700
I should think that's pretty self-explanatory.

4396
03:24:49,440 --> 03:24:51,620
Your friend is in that jar over there.

4397
03:24:52,020 --> 03:24:53,260
She's alive, too.

4398
03:24:53,800 --> 03:24:55,140
What's left of her.

4399
03:24:55,580 --> 03:24:58,300
Then your stock just fucking crashed!

4400
03:24:58,780 --> 03:25:00,240
I love you, mom.

4401
03:25:00,420 --> 03:25:01,680
She's got psychic powers!

4402
03:25:09,080 --> 03:25:09,640
Ew!

4403
03:25:11,040 --> 03:25:12,500
I don't understand!

4404
03:25:13,240 --> 03:25:14,960
The formula should've worked!

4405
03:25:15,080 --> 03:25:15,740
No, Varla!

4406
03:25:15,980 --> 03:25:18,240
Say night-night to mommy, asshole!

4407
03:25:20,660 --> 03:25:24,260
Well, I guess there goes Varla.

4408
03:25:24,440 --> 03:25:26,360
And I think it's past your fucking bedtime, young man!

4409
03:25:26,940 --> 03:25:28,220
This game is intense.

4410
03:25:35,460 --> 03:25:36,700
Oh my god, the boobs.

4411
03:25:37,560 --> 03:25:39,200
I guess this is it.

4412
03:25:39,560 --> 03:25:40,840
It's certainly been an adventure.

4413
03:25:41,080 --> 03:25:41,420
Yeah.

4414
03:25:41,420 --> 03:25:42,280
You wanna do the honors?

4415
03:25:43,600 --> 03:25:44,040
Varla...

4416
03:25:44,980 --> 03:25:46,060
This is for you.

4417
03:25:47,880 --> 03:25:50,820
Well, we have our...

4418
03:25:50,820 --> 03:25:51,240
Oh my god.

4419
03:25:51,880 --> 03:25:53,000
Why are we just gonna...

4420
03:25:53,000 --> 03:25:53,540
Huh?

4421
03:25:56,520 --> 03:25:58,720
How we survived that, I don't know.

4422
03:25:58,860 --> 03:25:59,200
What?

4423
03:25:59,580 --> 03:26:04,520
If we hadn't found these miniguns just lying around, we'd be fucking dead for sure.

4424
03:26:04,960 --> 03:26:07,380
I'm just glad Varla got the justice she deserved.

4425
03:26:07,440 --> 03:26:07,720
Wait, what?

4426
03:26:08,400 --> 03:26:10,680
So, what do you plan to do with your life now, Isaac?

4427
03:26:11,600 --> 03:26:12,040
Well...

4428
03:26:12,040 --> 03:26:17,380
I figured as soon as I got home, I'd go pay my respects to my old man.

4429
03:26:17,720 --> 03:26:18,500
And then?

4430
03:26:18,660 --> 03:26:22,320
And then Washington's going to fucking Vegas, baby!

4431
03:26:25,100 --> 03:26:26,960
She's still fucking alive, ain't she?

4432
03:26:28,060 --> 03:26:29,220
Oh my god.

4433
03:26:29,420 --> 03:26:30,640
I was gonna say, no way.

4434
03:26:30,960 --> 03:26:32,400
I'm at somewhat of a loss.

4435
03:26:33,340 --> 03:26:35,880
Then let's just make this look fucking cool.

4436
03:26:36,060 --> 03:26:36,720
Those were...

4437
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:38,960
You guys...

4438
03:26:38,960 --> 03:26:39,660
Um...

4439
03:26:40,300 --> 03:26:40,940
You guys...

4440
03:26:40,940 --> 03:26:41,380
Um...

4441
03:26:42,040 --> 03:26:42,440
What?

4442
03:26:42,440 --> 03:26:42,820
You got...

4443
03:26:42,820 --> 03:26:43,640
Mother.

4444
03:26:44,800 --> 03:26:45,700
Oh my god.

4445
03:26:48,600 --> 03:26:50,180
Let's go after mother, baby.

4446
03:26:51,820 --> 03:26:52,480
Final exam.

4447
03:26:52,540 --> 03:26:53,340
Word association.

4448
03:26:54,040 --> 03:26:57,000
Type anything as long as you type like a motherfucker.

4449
03:26:57,540 --> 03:26:58,400
Wait, what?

4450
03:26:58,980 --> 03:27:00,240
What should I type?

4451
03:27:06,040 --> 03:27:07,320
Oh, feet.

4452
03:27:08,260 --> 03:27:08,900
What?

4453
03:27:08,920 --> 03:27:09,500
Feet?

4454
03:27:09,580 --> 03:27:10,120
Oh god.

4455
03:27:10,640 --> 03:27:11,280
Um...

4456
03:27:11,280 --> 03:27:12,560
Enemy types.

4457
03:27:13,200 --> 03:27:13,840
Um...

4458
03:27:13,840 --> 03:27:13,980
Ah!

4459
03:27:29,340 --> 03:27:29,860
Shitting?

4460
03:27:31,700 --> 03:27:32,220
Puking?

4461
03:27:32,960 --> 03:27:33,480
Puking!

4462
03:27:33,920 --> 03:27:34,440
Puking!

4463
03:27:35,020 --> 03:27:35,540
Puking!

4464
03:27:38,120 --> 03:27:38,640
Zombie!

4465
03:28:03,140 --> 03:28:04,680
Oh, words associated?

4466
03:28:04,940 --> 03:28:09,120
Okay, so I have to type words associated with the thing that is...

4467
03:28:09,120 --> 03:28:09,920
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4468
03:28:10,220 --> 03:28:11,100
Okay, okay, okay.

4469
03:28:12,540 --> 03:28:13,060
Score?

4470
03:28:13,420 --> 03:28:13,860
Yeah, yeah.

4471
03:28:14,040 --> 03:28:14,560
Continue?

4472
03:28:14,840 --> 03:28:15,160
Yes.

4473
03:28:16,620 --> 03:28:17,300
Agent G!

4474
03:28:17,500 --> 03:28:18,700
Sunglasses!

4475
03:28:19,440 --> 03:28:20,840
Cool!

4476
03:28:22,020 --> 03:28:22,400
G!

4477
03:28:23,320 --> 03:28:24,720
Awesome!

4478
03:28:28,540 --> 03:28:29,940
G!

4479
03:28:30,260 --> 03:28:32,020
Agent... oh shit.

4480
03:28:32,700 --> 03:28:36,180
Oh, country music!

4481
03:28:37,040 --> 03:28:38,440
Western!

4482
03:28:38,780 --> 03:28:39,840
Country!

4483
03:28:46,190 --> 03:28:47,590
Sexy!

4484
03:28:47,870 --> 03:28:49,170
Stripper!

4485
03:28:49,410 --> 03:28:50,450
Candy!

4486
03:28:53,490 --> 03:28:53,750
Sister!

4487
03:28:54,410 --> 03:28:55,530
Lover!

4488
03:28:56,330 --> 03:28:57,950
Hot girl!

4489
03:28:58,310 --> 03:28:59,350
Hottie!

4490
03:29:00,050 --> 03:29:01,170
Patootie!

4491
03:29:02,090 --> 03:29:03,210
Ass!

4492
03:29:03,470 --> 03:29:05,030
Nice ass!

4493
03:29:05,330 --> 03:29:07,210
What else?

4494
03:29:07,530 --> 03:29:08,290
Tattoos!

4495
03:29:10,510 --> 03:29:11,630
Tits!

4496
03:29:11,710 --> 03:29:12,550
Titties!

4497
03:29:13,190 --> 03:29:14,310
Baddie!

4498
03:29:14,310 --> 03:29:15,630
Yeah, bad ass!

4499
03:29:15,670 --> 03:29:16,690
Isaac Washington!

4500
03:29:17,050 --> 03:29:18,170
Fucker!

4501
03:29:18,310 --> 03:29:19,430
Motherfucker!

4502
03:29:19,650 --> 03:29:20,670
Puking!

4503
03:29:20,790 --> 03:29:21,790
Bitch!

4504
03:29:21,950 --> 03:29:22,970
Fucker!

4505
03:29:25,570 --> 03:29:26,010
Assfucker!

4506
03:29:28,170 --> 03:29:28,610
Bitchfucker!

4507
03:29:37,530 --> 03:29:38,410
What else?

4508
03:29:38,630 --> 03:29:39,210
This is...

4509
03:29:40,550 --> 03:29:41,430
Yeah, lollipop!

4510
03:29:46,500 --> 03:29:46,940
Appropriate!

4511
03:29:59,500 --> 03:30:00,360
Oh, Jasper!

4512
03:30:00,460 --> 03:30:00,760
Jasper!

4513
03:30:00,940 --> 03:30:01,220
Oh shit.

4514
03:30:01,380 --> 03:30:02,620
Oh my god, I'm not gonna make it.

4515
03:30:02,620 --> 03:30:03,500
You're dead.

4516
03:30:04,820 --> 03:30:06,500
I didn't realize it changed.

4517
03:30:11,790 --> 03:30:13,550
Okay, this is fine, everybody.

4518
03:30:13,890 --> 03:30:15,750
Oh, Jasper!

4519
03:30:16,890 --> 03:30:17,450
Genius?

4520
03:30:19,090 --> 03:30:20,130
Hot girlfriend?

4521
03:30:25,890 --> 03:30:26,450
Glasses?

4522
03:30:26,870 --> 03:30:27,790
Oh, we did it.

4523
03:30:27,870 --> 03:30:28,030
Okay.

4524
03:30:28,670 --> 03:30:29,230
Suggestive?

4525
03:30:30,450 --> 03:30:32,310
I could have said brother, you're right.

4526
03:30:33,830 --> 03:30:35,270
Candy, yeah, we had candy.

4527
03:30:35,390 --> 03:30:36,330
It's okay, we did it.

4528
03:30:40,860 --> 03:30:45,540
I love the WT difference between struggling with other problems but locked in at Barlow's.

4529
03:30:45,640 --> 03:30:47,340
It threw me off so much!

4530
03:30:49,840 --> 03:30:54,080
I can't go on in a world without my mommy!

4531
03:30:54,300 --> 03:30:55,600
Oh my god, he's gonna blow us all to hell.

4532
03:30:55,740 --> 03:30:57,000
I would never accept him.

4533
03:30:57,260 --> 03:30:58,860
You're fucking right there!

4534
03:30:59,060 --> 03:30:59,940
Into the potty mouth.

4535
03:31:00,040 --> 03:31:01,380
I'm sorry, it was the game!

4536
03:31:01,720 --> 03:31:03,360
It wasn't me, it was the game!

4537
03:31:03,460 --> 03:31:03,740
Please!

4538
03:31:03,740 --> 03:31:05,040
This is a dead man's switch.

4539
03:31:05,400 --> 03:31:06,040
I'm sorry!

4540
03:31:06,040 --> 03:31:07,000
We've nothing to live for.

4541
03:31:07,220 --> 03:31:08,760
It was the game, it wasn't me!

4542
03:31:09,140 --> 03:31:11,540
Kill me and the self-destruct for the lab beneath us goes off.

4543
03:31:11,740 --> 03:31:14,420
This whole prison will be leveled.

4544
03:31:14,420 --> 03:31:15,760
Then what do you want?

4545
03:31:16,160 --> 03:31:18,400
I'll go wash my mouth out with soap.

4546
03:31:18,880 --> 03:31:22,380
I want to undo all the wrongs I have done.

4547
03:31:23,140 --> 03:31:25,320
I want to return to the womb.

4548
03:31:26,580 --> 03:31:27,140
Please.

4549
03:31:27,840 --> 03:31:30,280
Just this one last thing.

4550
03:31:30,640 --> 03:31:31,720
To the womb?

4551
03:31:31,800 --> 03:31:33,340
You fucking handle this freak show.

4552
03:31:33,340 --> 03:31:34,700
I need to sit down.

4553
03:31:34,840 --> 03:31:37,720
When revenge seemed the only option.

4554
03:31:38,140 --> 03:31:39,640
You've broken a hundred laws.

4555
03:31:39,860 --> 03:31:42,980
You're responsible for the deaths of countless thousands.

4556
03:31:43,200 --> 03:31:46,820
You've threatened the safety of every man, woman and child on this planet.

4557
03:31:46,980 --> 03:31:49,480
And you put our friend's brain in a jar!

4558
03:31:50,080 --> 03:31:52,020
I have a lot to atone for.

4559
03:31:52,360 --> 03:31:54,140
By returning to the womb?

4560
03:31:54,720 --> 03:31:55,540
That's right.

4561
03:31:56,400 --> 03:31:58,560
A final noble act.

4562
03:31:59,000 --> 03:31:59,720
Give me that.

4563
03:32:00,420 --> 03:32:01,460
Thank you.

4564
03:32:01,460 --> 03:32:03,600
That was all that was needed.

4565
03:32:03,760 --> 03:32:03,900
Huh?

4566
03:32:04,240 --> 03:32:05,560
Don't fucking thank him.

4567
03:32:05,680 --> 03:32:10,560
As soon as we're in a helicopter out of here, I'm chucking that thing out the fucking window.

4568
03:32:11,000 --> 03:32:13,140
Then I can die happy.

4569
03:32:13,960 --> 03:32:15,340
Goodbye, boys.

4570
03:32:15,400 --> 03:32:17,060
He's crawling to his mom.

4571
03:32:18,520 --> 03:32:19,400
Are we good?

4572
03:32:31,960 --> 03:32:34,620
Did you not find this all slightly ironic?

4573
03:32:35,160 --> 03:32:37,020
I fuckingronic?

4574
03:32:37,380 --> 03:32:38,280
Yeah, ironic.

4575
03:32:38,420 --> 03:32:40,860
You know when something occurs after you...

4576
03:32:40,860 --> 03:32:42,020
I know what ironic is.

4577
03:32:42,040 --> 03:32:42,800
...it means, motherfucker.

4578
03:32:43,220 --> 03:32:44,080
You say you did it again.

4579
03:32:44,440 --> 03:32:48,220
Throughout this whole episode, you've been motherfucking everything.

4580
03:32:48,620 --> 03:32:48,840
Yeah.

4581
03:32:48,880 --> 03:32:49,600
That's my thing.

4582
03:32:49,860 --> 03:32:51,200
That's how I fucking speak.

4583
03:32:51,200 --> 03:32:52,980
See, that's why I associate it with him.

4584
03:32:53,300 --> 03:32:56,780
There we were, face to face with a real motherfucker.

4585
03:32:57,280 --> 03:32:58,280
Oh, no.

4586
03:32:58,560 --> 03:33:01,020
Clement more than likely fucked his mother.

4587
03:33:01,040 --> 03:33:01,340
No.

4588
03:33:01,560 --> 03:33:03,300
Stop talking, Agent G.

4589
03:33:03,820 --> 03:33:05,020
Stop talking.

4590
03:33:05,200 --> 03:33:08,380
When indeed he was most probably a real motherfucker.

4591
03:33:08,620 --> 03:33:10,660
So what does that tell you?

4592
03:33:10,780 --> 03:33:11,940
I don't fucking know.

4593
03:33:11,940 --> 03:33:15,320
It means you don't fucking mean what you fucking say.

4594
03:33:15,540 --> 03:33:16,120
It's all shit.

4595
03:33:16,260 --> 03:33:17,380
Say what, motherfucker?

4596
03:33:17,800 --> 03:33:19,980
See, you're doing it fucking again.

4597
03:33:20,860 --> 03:33:21,920
You like me.

4598
03:33:22,060 --> 03:33:26,040
Deep down through all your fuckisms, you really like me.

4599
03:33:26,180 --> 03:33:30,780
I'm the fucking nearest fucking thing you've ever had to a fucking friend.

4600
03:33:31,120 --> 03:33:32,700
Don't fucking do this to me, man.

4601
03:33:32,920 --> 03:33:34,460
Wrong fucking place.

4602
03:33:34,520 --> 03:33:35,000
Wrong...

4603
03:33:35,000 --> 03:33:35,560
Go on.

4604
03:33:35,580 --> 03:33:36,020
Go on.

4605
03:33:36,040 --> 03:33:36,460
Say it.

4606
03:33:36,580 --> 03:33:37,540
Say the fuck what?

4607
03:33:37,720 --> 03:33:39,380
Say you like me.

4608
03:33:39,380 --> 03:33:40,300
This is Yowie.

4609
03:33:40,300 --> 03:33:41,140
Get the fuck out of my space.

4610
03:33:41,700 --> 03:33:44,660
Never repeat fucking talk of that shit again.

4611
03:33:44,780 --> 03:33:45,280
Or what?

4612
03:33:45,660 --> 03:33:47,160
I don't fucking know what.

4613
03:33:47,300 --> 03:33:48,420
The music, even.

4614
03:33:48,620 --> 03:33:49,460
Okay, man.

4615
03:33:49,520 --> 03:33:49,800
Okay.

4616
03:33:50,120 --> 03:33:51,380
We made progress here.

4617
03:33:51,560 --> 03:33:52,380
You did good.

4618
03:33:52,640 --> 03:34:03,060
When we're back home, I am going to get myself a car, play my country music, and if you want to ride back to where the fuck ever you live, you are motherfucking welcome.

4619
03:34:03,280 --> 03:34:04,500
Fuck you.

4620
03:34:04,700 --> 03:34:06,560
So that's a yes, then.

4621
03:34:06,600 --> 03:34:07,140
Can I drive?

4622
03:34:07,900 --> 03:34:08,820
Yeah, fuck you.

4623
03:34:09,400 --> 03:34:11,620
Washington is washing off on you.

4624
03:34:12,680 --> 03:34:13,160
Yeah.

4625
03:34:17,050 --> 03:34:19,590
He really did chuck it out the window, like he said.

4626
03:34:21,190 --> 03:34:22,030
Oh my God.

4627
03:34:22,170 --> 03:34:22,850
Barla Guns.

4628
03:34:23,310 --> 03:34:23,790
Barla.

4629
03:34:24,030 --> 03:34:29,350
If you can hear me, I'd like you to know I think you're the most beautiful woman I've ever met.

4630
03:34:29,570 --> 03:34:31,810
Now that just ain't right.

4631
03:34:32,010 --> 03:34:36,830
I think if we've learned anything from today, it's that love ain't always right.

4632
03:34:37,110 --> 03:34:38,790
Hey, I love my old man.

4633
03:34:39,010 --> 03:34:40,330
You saying that ain't right?

4634
03:34:40,410 --> 03:34:41,010
What is happening?

4635
03:34:41,230 --> 03:34:41,370
Well...

4636
03:34:41,370 --> 03:34:45,050
And your fiancé in that jar there loved her brother.

4637
03:34:45,290 --> 03:34:47,110
I was just making an observation.

4638
03:34:47,950 --> 03:34:54,430
Frankly, Casanova, I'd be more worried about reading the past 12 hours as a damning fucking indictment of contemporary feminism.

4639
03:34:55,090 --> 03:34:55,930
Beg pardon?

4640
03:34:56,270 --> 03:35:00,370
I just think two dick-wielding cop clichés taking down a 100-foot...

4641
03:35:00,370 --> 03:35:01,630
What is going on?

4642
03:35:01,770 --> 03:35:04,290
...burping mother is a statement fairly limited in its interpretations.

4643
03:35:04,330 --> 03:35:06,570
I'm not sure you can read too much into that.

4644
03:35:06,810 --> 03:35:10,870
Not to mention, the strongest female role model in this whole affair...

4645
03:35:10,870 --> 03:35:13,250
...ain't much more than a gherkin in a pickle jar.

4646
03:35:13,550 --> 03:35:14,110
Washington?

4647
03:35:14,790 --> 03:35:16,930
They had met as adversaries.

4648
03:35:16,930 --> 03:35:17,990
She's, like, covering her ears.

4649
03:35:18,390 --> 03:35:18,890
What the fuck is it?

4650
03:35:18,910 --> 03:35:20,470
They had fought as allies.

4651
03:35:21,030 --> 03:35:22,210
I love you, man.

4652
03:35:22,470 --> 03:35:24,070
Shut the fuck up.

4653
03:35:24,230 --> 03:35:25,810
But to their enemies...

4654
03:35:25,810 --> 03:35:27,110
And you?

4655
03:35:27,270 --> 03:35:27,650
Me?

4656
03:35:27,990 --> 03:35:30,850
One-way ticket to motherfucking Vegas, baby.

4657
03:35:30,850 --> 03:35:31,570
They're talking to me!

4658
03:35:33,170 --> 03:35:36,230
They were righteous motherfuckers.

4659
03:35:36,390 --> 03:35:36,750
Yeah!

4660
03:35:54,260 --> 03:35:55,720
That was amazing!

4661
03:36:00,560 --> 03:36:05,600
That was so fun!

4662
03:36:06,480 --> 03:36:08,920
We never knew what the G stood for.

4663
03:36:14,720 --> 03:36:16,040
Who was...

4664
03:36:17,740 --> 03:36:19,220
Who was the Clement?

4665
03:36:19,340 --> 03:36:23,060
I didn't see his name.

4666
03:36:24,950 --> 03:36:26,100
They call him James.

4667
03:36:30,900 --> 03:36:34,300
Well, never saw him.

4668
03:36:35,260 --> 03:36:35,860
Jesus.

4669
03:36:36,640 --> 03:36:37,620
Sounds of a great game.

4670
03:36:39,160 --> 03:36:41,100
That was so crazy.

4671
03:36:42,440 --> 03:36:44,300
Why do you enjoy this spectacle game?

4672
03:36:44,560 --> 03:36:46,000
Thank you for playing it.

4673
03:36:46,080 --> 03:36:47,740
Great Shenmue for you, Thank you!

4674
03:36:48,060 --> 03:36:49,320
Good playing, everybody.

4675
03:36:49,620 --> 03:36:50,180
Good playing.

4676
03:36:50,780 --> 03:36:51,920
Thank you, Sega.

4677
03:36:52,340 --> 03:36:53,560
For this game.

4678
03:36:56,060 --> 03:36:57,660
I can't believe this is real!

4679
03:36:58,040 --> 03:36:59,500
That's me like you.

4680
03:37:06,870 --> 03:37:10,510
I do push through in getting this game to work because this was a WoW game.

4681
03:37:10,770 --> 03:37:12,170
Thanks for this MFing adventure.

4682
03:37:14,530 --> 03:37:17,610
Sorry, Washington rubbed off on me a little bit at the end there.

4683
03:37:18,230 --> 03:37:21,650
Never would have guessed that ending.

4684
03:37:21,890 --> 03:37:23,030
100 out of 10 game.

4685
03:37:25,670 --> 03:37:26,770
Oh, so fun!

4686
03:37:27,730 --> 03:37:30,050
I wonder if there... there is DLC for this.

4687
03:37:30,890 --> 03:37:33,150
It would be great to see Sonic in this game.

4688
03:37:42,980 --> 03:37:43,960
Hold on, hold on a second.

4689
03:37:44,120 --> 03:37:45,700
I'm telling my friend I'll be there soon.

4690
03:38:09,360 --> 03:38:11,140
I'm so hungry with eyes.

4691
03:38:12,880 --> 03:38:13,880
I'm so hungry.

4692
03:38:15,400 --> 03:38:17,180
Thanks for playing this funny game.

4693
03:38:17,400 --> 03:38:17,640
Yeah!

4694
03:38:18,440 --> 03:38:19,340
That's so fun.

4695
03:38:19,400 --> 03:38:19,920
So much fun.

4696
03:38:21,620 --> 03:38:23,600
DLC doesn't add anything to the story.

4697
03:38:24,660 --> 03:38:27,360
Yeah, but what if there was DLC to add Sonic the Hedgehog?

4698
03:38:28,100 --> 03:38:29,120
That's what I would do.

4699
03:38:30,880 --> 03:38:31,360
Eww.

4700
03:38:31,360 --> 03:38:31,960
Eww.

4701
03:38:36,400 --> 03:38:37,120
I

4702
03:38:41,850 --> 03:38:42,390
got an E.

4703
03:38:47,030 --> 03:38:48,810
Does Sonic say FF?

4704
03:38:50,590 --> 03:38:53,530
Actually, maybe he would.

4705
03:38:59,400 --> 03:39:00,380
Ending sequence?

4706
03:39:01,400 --> 03:39:02,360
Ending sequence?

4707
03:39:04,420 --> 03:39:06,020
XOL power in action.

4708
03:39:06,020 --> 03:39:07,880
I did pretty well, I think, sometimes.

4709
03:39:11,040 --> 03:39:12,440
Oh, sorry, was the music too loud?

4710
03:39:12,980 --> 03:39:13,420
Hello, Isaac.

4711
03:39:13,420 --> 03:39:14,320
This is Caesar.

4712
03:39:15,200 --> 03:39:17,340
We've never seen eye to eye, you and I.

4713
03:39:17,940 --> 03:39:20,920
But I wanted you to be aware of some important things.

4714
03:39:21,940 --> 03:39:26,520
I find myself burdened with an inexorable sense of moral duty, Isaac.

4715
03:39:27,380 --> 03:39:31,200
And in the absence of a friend to confide in, I turn to you.

4716
03:39:32,120 --> 03:39:33,460
Am I better now?

4717
03:39:33,460 --> 03:39:34,280
Yes, darling, yes.

4718
03:39:34,720 --> 03:39:36,660
The Cretan prison warden?

4719
03:39:36,800 --> 03:39:37,220
Yeah.

4720
03:39:37,580 --> 03:39:40,740
It was he who originally discovered the mutant compound.

4721
03:39:41,060 --> 03:39:43,200
In a secret lab beneath this bridge.

4722
03:39:43,200 --> 03:39:44,380
Rin Hanamaru Arena.

4723
03:39:44,980 --> 03:39:47,680
Clement's ambitions are small-minded, Isaac.

4724
03:39:48,140 --> 03:39:49,620
But he has friends.

4725
03:39:50,640 --> 03:39:51,760
Powerful friends.

4726
03:39:51,780 --> 03:39:52,640
Yes, sir.

4727
03:39:53,000 --> 03:39:56,420
And they have had access to the compound for some time.

4728
03:40:22,300 --> 03:40:23,020
No, sir.

4729
03:40:23,020 --> 03:40:23,560
So...

4730
03:40:26,180 --> 03:40:27,700
He wasn't the bad guy.

4731
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:28,520
And...

4732
03:40:29,540 --> 03:40:31,100
Oh my god!

4733
03:40:31,560 --> 03:40:33,300
His dad was still alive!

4734
03:40:34,120 --> 03:40:35,960
Typing of the dad, typing of the dad!

4735
03:40:36,720 --> 03:40:37,980
93% accurate.

4736
03:40:38,040 --> 03:40:40,020
I think that's the lowest I've gotten, but that's okay.

4737
03:40:43,060 --> 03:40:43,580
Yay!

4738
03:40:49,890 --> 03:40:51,850
Typing in the dead hardcore mode.

4739
03:40:51,950 --> 03:40:54,590
Become a zero-tolerance keyboard warrior.

4740
03:40:55,150 --> 03:40:56,550
What does that even mean?

4741
03:40:59,870 --> 03:41:00,850
We did it!

4742
03:41:02,370 --> 03:41:03,270
We did it!

4743
03:41:03,330 --> 03:41:03,630
We did it!

4744
03:41:03,690 --> 03:41:04,070
We did it!

4745
03:41:04,410 --> 03:41:07,150
A doting sibling to a crippled brother.

4746
03:41:07,810 --> 03:41:09,550
Forced into a life of vice.

4747
03:41:09,870 --> 03:41:13,530
Now she's filled with a primal hunger for revenge.

4748
03:41:13,670 --> 03:41:14,230
Oh, Candy.

4749
03:41:15,070 --> 03:41:15,750
Oh, wait.

4750
03:41:16,790 --> 03:41:17,670
Where was it?

4751
03:41:19,070 --> 03:41:20,310
Was it in the story mode?

4752
03:41:20,690 --> 03:41:21,450
Oh, here we go.

4753
03:41:21,590 --> 03:41:22,110
Memorabilia.

4754
03:41:23,390 --> 03:41:25,230
Let's look at some more of the 3D models.

4755
03:41:27,930 --> 03:41:30,610
This game certainly got big cowabunga energy.

4756
03:41:30,870 --> 03:41:31,790
Thanks for the stories.

4757
03:41:35,930 --> 03:41:36,450
Dave.

4758
03:41:41,530 --> 03:41:43,170
Oh, all of them are unlocked now.

4759
03:41:43,430 --> 03:41:43,910
Let's go.

4760
03:41:44,710 --> 03:41:45,230
Redneck.

4761
03:41:46,190 --> 03:41:46,710
Captain...

4762
03:41:46,710 --> 03:41:47,710
Stop, Poker.

4763
03:41:48,370 --> 03:41:49,370
Oh, wait.

4764
03:41:49,450 --> 03:41:49,790
Just kidding.

4765
03:41:49,870 --> 03:41:50,650
They're not all unlocked.

4766
03:41:50,930 --> 03:41:51,570
I'm a liar.

4767
03:41:53,350 --> 03:41:54,710
I would have to play again.

4768
03:41:55,890 --> 03:41:57,970
Why is it Washington?

4769
03:41:59,010 --> 03:42:03,510
I've been wondering what his shirt is this whole time and it won't let me zoom in.

4770
03:42:03,610 --> 03:42:04,590
This game is so cruel.

4771
03:42:06,530 --> 03:42:08,390
I've been wondering what his shirt is.

4772
03:42:09,110 --> 03:42:09,610
Candy.

4773
03:42:13,450 --> 03:42:13,950
Clement.

4774
03:42:14,610 --> 03:42:16,050
This guy is such a freak.

4775
03:42:16,310 --> 03:42:17,690
Look at his yaoi hands.

4776
03:42:18,590 --> 03:42:19,590
You are such a...

4777
03:42:19,590 --> 03:42:20,710
Look at the way he stands.

4778
03:42:21,470 --> 03:42:22,830
You're such a freak.

4779
03:42:24,550 --> 03:42:25,030
Mother.

4780
03:42:26,390 --> 03:42:27,310
Oh my god.

4781
03:42:28,270 --> 03:42:29,970
Mother is mothering.

4782
03:42:31,290 --> 03:42:31,770
Grandma.

4783
03:42:36,830 --> 03:42:38,050
She's a freak, too.

4784
03:42:38,830 --> 03:42:39,310
Yeah.

4785
03:42:41,550 --> 03:42:43,790
Secret written on the back of the stripper zombie?

4786
03:42:44,430 --> 03:42:45,110
There is?

4787
03:42:49,150 --> 03:42:51,610
Wait, but we looked at the back of the stripper zombie.

4788
03:42:51,730 --> 03:42:52,110
Did we not?

4789
03:42:52,330 --> 03:42:52,810
Yeah.

4790
03:42:54,690 --> 03:42:55,990
There's something written here?

4791
03:42:56,170 --> 03:42:57,230
I just see the claws.

4792
03:43:02,220 --> 03:43:03,540
I don't see anything.

4793
03:43:03,660 --> 03:43:05,380
Wait, was this a ruse?

4794
03:43:23,660 --> 03:43:25,800
I hate you guys!

4795
03:43:32,700 --> 03:43:38,360
Please, I'm actually really gullible, so please!

4796
03:43:39,380 --> 03:43:42,480
No, wait, I think I saw... Oh my god, it's the SMG!

4797
03:43:43,780 --> 03:43:44,340
No!

4798
03:43:46,080 --> 03:43:49,000
Oh my gosh, I'm actually so gullible.

4799
03:43:49,500 --> 03:43:51,000
Oh my gosh.

4800
03:43:52,820 --> 03:43:54,900
I hate you guys so much.

4801
03:43:56,840 --> 03:43:58,120
Ice cream truck.

4802
03:43:58,520 --> 03:44:00,800
Wait, what does the ice cream truck fall under?

4803
03:44:01,060 --> 03:44:02,180
Oh, it's its own thing.

4804
03:44:02,460 --> 03:44:03,060
That's so fun.

4805
03:44:05,340 --> 03:44:07,140
Well guys, this was fun.

4806
03:44:07,340 --> 03:44:09,300
Thank you for hanging out with me.

4807
03:44:10,900 --> 03:44:12,460
I wanna see some of the comments.

4808
03:44:12,480 --> 03:44:12,880
Concept art.

4809
03:44:13,000 --> 03:44:16,200
Oh my god, it's terrifying though.

4810
03:44:16,720 --> 03:44:18,720
Thanks for the five gifted!

4811
03:44:19,540 --> 03:44:20,480
Thank you!

4812
03:44:20,820 --> 03:44:21,800
The twins!

4813
03:44:23,580 --> 03:44:24,220
Ewww.

4814
03:44:28,740 --> 03:44:30,460
Did I get my wallet yet?

4815
03:44:30,640 --> 03:44:30,960
Nope.

4816
03:44:31,180 --> 03:44:35,640
I'm actually off to go meet with a friend who I sent money to.

4817
03:44:36,100 --> 03:44:37,220
I'm gonna...

4818
03:44:37,220 --> 03:44:37,560
Woah!

4819
03:44:39,260 --> 03:44:39,900
Icky.

4820
03:44:40,600 --> 03:44:41,360
We die!

4821
03:44:41,880 --> 03:44:43,140
Thanks for the gifted.

4822
03:44:44,320 --> 03:44:47,000
Why did it take me so long to realize this is House of the Dead?

4823
03:44:47,100 --> 03:44:49,180
But instead of using a mouse and a controller, it's just typing.

4824
03:44:49,380 --> 03:44:49,620
Yeah!

4825
03:44:51,640 --> 03:44:52,660
That's basically it.

4826
03:44:52,920 --> 03:44:53,280
Puker.

4827
03:44:53,380 --> 03:44:54,140
I hate that guy.

4828
03:44:55,300 --> 03:44:56,020
H&G!

4829
03:44:57,900 --> 03:45:00,620
Did you know that the ice cream truck license plate reads...

4830
03:45:01,720 --> 03:45:02,080
Gullifuss?

4831
03:45:04,320 --> 03:45:05,480
I hate you all.

4832
03:45:06,660 --> 03:45:07,520
Oh my gosh, wait!

4833
03:45:07,560 --> 03:45:08,280
I love the hat!

4834
03:45:11,620 --> 03:45:13,420
I think they should have kept the Zune hat.

4835
03:45:13,420 --> 03:45:14,680
Oh, Varla.

4836
03:45:16,480 --> 03:45:18,920
This is all concept art though, so...

4837
03:45:18,920 --> 03:45:20,120
It all changed, right?

4838
03:45:21,300 --> 03:45:22,940
Oh, the three of them!

4839
03:45:24,100 --> 03:45:25,900
Why don't they include Candy?

4840
03:45:28,820 --> 03:45:29,440
Woah!

4841
03:45:30,380 --> 03:45:31,000
Candy!

4842
03:45:33,700 --> 03:45:34,320
Wowee.

4843
03:45:35,000 --> 03:45:36,060
She's so cute.

4844
03:45:40,820 --> 03:45:43,020
This game makes me wanna play like...

4845
03:45:43,020 --> 03:45:45,120
Lollipop Chainsaw or something, you know?

4846
03:45:47,440 --> 03:45:48,560
Or, um...

4847
03:45:49,700 --> 03:45:51,200
Oh, what's that other one?

4848
03:45:51,360 --> 03:45:54,160
That one that's getting the new remake coming out.

4849
03:45:58,280 --> 03:45:58,840
Uhh...

4850
03:46:00,600 --> 03:46:01,160
Uhhh...

4851
03:46:01,780 --> 03:46:03,140
It's also Grasshopper.

4852
03:46:04,800 --> 03:46:05,780
Dead Rising!

4853
03:46:06,180 --> 03:46:07,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4854
03:46:07,360 --> 03:46:08,420
Dead Rising.

4855
03:46:11,780 --> 03:46:13,360
The Fetid Waters.

4856
03:46:13,360 --> 03:46:16,680
From the putrid depths of mystery.

4857
03:46:17,020 --> 03:46:18,500
It has come to maim.

4858
03:46:18,600 --> 03:46:19,820
It has come to kill.

4859
03:46:19,940 --> 03:46:20,900
It has come to feed.

4860
03:46:21,120 --> 03:46:22,920
It came from...

4861
03:46:22,920 --> 03:46:24,620
Dun-dun-dun!

4862
03:46:26,040 --> 03:46:29,820
I love these, like, old school pictures, right?

4863
03:46:30,100 --> 03:46:31,420
Oh my god, Sega, right there!

4864
03:46:33,360 --> 03:46:34,460
Two months of Minto.

4865
03:46:34,600 --> 03:46:35,340
Thanks, Urban!

4866
03:46:37,580 --> 03:46:39,020
50,000 dead.

4867
03:46:39,220 --> 03:46:40,840
They're just getting started.

4868
03:46:41,700 --> 03:46:42,260
Overkill.

4869
03:46:44,640 --> 03:46:47,060
House of the Dead Overkill!

4870
03:46:49,540 --> 03:46:50,220
Nice.

4871
03:46:51,980 --> 03:46:53,400
In the comic book.

4872
03:46:54,020 --> 03:46:55,140
Prelude to...

4873
03:46:55,140 --> 03:46:55,940
Oh, prelude.

4874
03:47:08,920 --> 03:47:12,160
I don't think Dead Rising is being censored.

4875
03:47:12,440 --> 03:47:13,780
That's not what I heard.

4876
03:47:16,800 --> 03:47:17,940
Oh, okay.

4877
03:47:18,840 --> 03:47:19,920
Okey-dokey.

4878
03:47:21,880 --> 03:47:23,260
I'm gonna go eat.

4879
03:47:23,440 --> 03:47:25,020
I'm gonna go get some money.

4880
03:47:25,160 --> 03:47:26,180
I'm gonna go out.

4881
03:47:26,200 --> 03:47:28,240
On the town, maybe.

4882
03:47:28,460 --> 03:47:29,420
I don't know, it's pretty hot.

4883
03:47:33,960 --> 03:47:35,820
Not the mom song.

4884
03:47:37,760 --> 03:47:39,080
Pathos, happy birthday!

4885
03:47:39,960 --> 03:47:43,180
Happy birthday to you.

4886
03:47:43,700 --> 03:47:46,360
Happy birthday to you.

4887
03:47:47,000 --> 03:47:49,240
Happy birthday, dear Pathos.

4888
03:47:50,520 --> 03:47:54,020
Happy birthday to you.

4889
03:47:55,700 --> 03:47:57,360
Happy birthday!

4890
03:48:00,960 --> 03:48:03,300
No, Jomar is also your birthday.

4891
03:48:03,420 --> 03:48:03,800
Oh my gosh.

4892
03:48:04,160 --> 03:48:07,420
Happy birthday to you.

4893
03:48:07,880 --> 03:48:11,360
Happy birthday to you.

4894
03:48:11,580 --> 03:48:14,660
Happy birthday, that guy Jomar.

4895
03:48:26,600 --> 03:48:29,300
I clicked out of the game.

4896
03:48:31,940 --> 03:48:32,740
Okay, guys.

4897
03:48:32,860 --> 03:48:33,500
I gotta get going.

4898
03:48:33,660 --> 03:48:34,080
For real.

4899
03:48:34,160 --> 03:48:36,600
Because I don't want to keep my friend waiting too long.

4900
03:48:37,260 --> 03:48:38,640
And I want to go eat.

4901
03:48:38,680 --> 03:48:39,720
Because I'm starving.

4902
03:48:40,000 --> 03:48:40,660
I'm so hungry.

4903
03:48:40,900 --> 03:48:42,360
Thank you guys for watching today!

4904
03:48:42,360 --> 03:48:45,460
This was so... I just expected House of the Dead.

4905
03:48:45,580 --> 03:48:47,960
I did not expect... Rather...

4906
03:48:47,960 --> 03:48:50,800
I don't remember House of the Dead being like this.

4907
03:48:51,300 --> 03:48:51,900
You know?

4908
03:48:53,900 --> 03:48:56,180
I don't remember it being so...

4909
03:48:59,360 --> 03:49:00,240
So... this.

4910
03:49:00,840 --> 03:49:02,100
But this was so much fun!

4911
03:49:02,520 --> 03:49:03,300
Thank you guys!

4912
03:49:03,520 --> 03:49:06,840
And I hope you guys have a good rest of your night or your day or whatever.

4913
03:49:07,180 --> 03:49:09,300
And I'll see you guys... Not tomorrow!

4914
03:49:09,640 --> 03:49:10,080
Sorry.

4915
03:49:11,340 --> 03:49:11,780
I...

4916
03:49:13,380 --> 03:49:15,240
I will not be streaming tomorrow.

4917
03:49:17,980 --> 03:49:18,420
But...

4918
03:49:19,760 --> 03:49:22,140
I have actually... Wait, can I show you guys?

4919
03:49:22,300 --> 03:49:22,660
Hold on.

4920
03:49:23,440 --> 03:49:25,000
I have a new thing.

4921
03:49:25,200 --> 03:49:25,600
Hold on.

4922
03:49:27,020 --> 03:49:27,780
Shut up, game.

4923
03:49:28,060 --> 03:49:29,020
I'm gonna quit the game.

4924
03:49:31,180 --> 03:49:31,840
There we go.

4925
03:49:32,000 --> 03:49:32,940
I have...

4926
03:49:34,980 --> 03:49:36,220
I have something.

4927
03:49:36,560 --> 03:49:38,180
I have...

4928
03:49:38,180 --> 03:49:39,480
Hold on.

4929
03:49:39,520 --> 03:49:40,700
I can't stop.

4930
03:49:41,240 --> 03:49:43,320
My brain is so dead right now.

4931
03:49:43,600 --> 03:49:45,480
How do I actually export this?

4932
03:49:46,580 --> 03:49:48,120
Actually, I'm not even quite sure.

4933
03:49:48,740 --> 03:49:49,480
Oh, there it is.

4934
03:49:49,580 --> 03:49:49,920
Export.

4935
03:49:58,960 --> 03:50:00,380
I can't type anymore.

4936
03:50:00,500 --> 03:50:01,080
Oh my god.

4937
03:50:01,120 --> 03:50:02,060
Everything is...

4938
03:50:02,060 --> 03:50:05,140
I'm so... My brain can't even think.

4939
03:50:05,320 --> 03:50:05,680
Oh wait!

4940
03:50:05,760 --> 03:50:06,380
No, no, no!

4941
03:50:06,620 --> 03:50:07,380
Oh my goodness.

4942
03:50:07,500 --> 03:50:07,860
Hold on.

4943
03:50:08,360 --> 03:50:08,800
Export.

4944
03:50:09,960 --> 03:50:10,720
There we go.

4945
03:50:14,170 --> 03:50:15,530
I think that did it.

4946
03:50:15,590 --> 03:50:17,210
Yeah, I think that did it.

4947
03:50:19,430 --> 03:50:19,970
Uh...

4948
03:50:20,670 --> 03:50:21,210
No...

4949
03:50:23,250 --> 03:50:25,350
I just wanna show you guys real quick.

4950
03:50:26,470 --> 03:50:28,270
I have a new schedule!

4951
03:50:29,770 --> 03:50:30,310
See?

4952
03:50:31,890 --> 03:50:33,390
It's a new schedule type.

4953
03:50:34,810 --> 03:50:36,110
So you'll see it.

4954
03:50:36,310 --> 03:50:39,190
It's obviously not accurate at all.

4955
03:50:39,290 --> 03:50:41,830
And nothing is right at all.

4956
03:50:42,810 --> 03:50:43,430
But...

4957
03:50:43,430 --> 03:50:44,910
New schedule!

4958
03:50:46,730 --> 03:50:47,870
Lorem ipsum!

4959
03:50:50,910 --> 03:50:51,530
So...

4960
03:50:51,530 --> 03:50:52,370
Yeah.

4961
03:50:55,010 --> 03:50:55,630
So...

4962
03:50:55,630 --> 03:50:57,010
Once I...

4963
03:50:57,010 --> 03:50:59,650
Once I have a schedule for next week...

4964
03:50:59,650 --> 03:51:01,090
I will...

4965
03:51:01,090 --> 03:51:04,370
You'll see this schedule being used.

4966
03:51:06,050 --> 03:51:07,690
I love stream title here.

4967
03:51:07,770 --> 03:51:08,210
You should.

4968
03:51:08,490 --> 03:51:09,750
You should love it.

4969
03:51:09,870 --> 03:51:11,370
You should love it very much.

4970
03:51:12,050 --> 03:51:13,190
It's so cute though, right?

4971
03:51:13,270 --> 03:51:14,110
It's like a maid cafe...

4972
03:51:14,110 --> 03:51:14,670
Here, I'll show you again.

4973
03:51:14,750 --> 03:51:17,170
It's like a maid cafe menu and everything.

4974
03:51:19,390 --> 03:51:22,490
Ciara did such a great job with it and designing it.

4975
03:51:22,990 --> 03:51:23,390
So...

4976
03:51:23,390 --> 03:51:23,910
Yeah.

4977
03:51:25,710 --> 03:51:26,470
Lorem ipsum.

4978
03:51:26,570 --> 03:51:27,250
Lorem ipsum.

4979
03:51:27,310 --> 03:51:27,990
Lorem ipsum.

4980
03:51:28,230 --> 03:51:28,910
Anyways, guys.

4981
03:51:28,990 --> 03:51:29,730
Thank you for watching.

4982
03:51:29,750 --> 03:51:30,710
Thanks for hanging out with me.

4983
03:51:30,770 --> 03:51:32,710
And I will see you guys later.

4984
03:51:33,750 --> 03:51:34,430
Bye-bye.

4985
03:51:34,990 --> 03:51:35,390
Otsumito.

4986
03:51:36,270 --> 03:51:36,670
Itterashai.

4987
03:51:37,310 --> 03:51:38,090
Bye-bye.

4988
03:51:38,330 --> 03:51:38,930
Bye-bye.

4989
03:51:38,970 --> 03:51:39,210
Bye-bye.

4990
03:51:39,210 --> 03:51:39,730
Bye-bye.

4991
03:51:39,730 --> 03:51:40,310
Bye.

4992
03:51:40,310 --> 03:51:40,770
Bye.

4993
03:51:40,770 --> 03:51:42,630
You are going to remember flowers.
