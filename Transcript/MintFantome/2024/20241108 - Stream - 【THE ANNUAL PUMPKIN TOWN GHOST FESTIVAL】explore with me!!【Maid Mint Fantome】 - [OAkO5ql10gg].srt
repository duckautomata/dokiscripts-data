1
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,280
My voice is dead from Minecraft, but I'm also dead.

2
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,820
Hello.

3
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,000
Hello.

4
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,520
Hello.

5
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,320
Hello, my voice.

6
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,700
Sorry.

7
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,140
Sorry.

8
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,180
I talked too much yesterday, probably.

9
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:15,940
Today?

10
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,040
Yesterday.

11
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,580
But I'm here.

12
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,860
Yeah.

13
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,940
Welcome, everybody.

15
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,900
I'm sleepy.

16
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,920
If you don't know why I'm sleepy...

17
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,180
You can check out the stream prior to this one.

18
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,520
Minecraft.

19
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,140
Minecraft.

20
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,260
Minecraft.

21
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,460
Sorry if I'm like...

22
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,780
Because my throat's... Actually, I have cough drops.

23
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,080
I have some... some...

24
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,640
This one.

25
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,800
There's a throat.

26
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,140
Mint.

27
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,790
Come out!

28
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,350
There we go.

29
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,810
Nom, nom, nom.

30
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,570
Is she tired from that short Minecraft stream earlier?

31
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,470
Oh, yeah.

32
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:26,510
Minecraft is just too exhausting for me to do for any number of hours.

33
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,970
How long was that?

34
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,890
What, like two, three hours, I think?

35
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,190
Minecraft therapy finds...

36
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,950
Thank you!

37
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,450
No, I had so much fun, if you watched it, thank you.

38
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,050
And...

39
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:45,570
Um...

40
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,590
Yeah.

41
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,690
It was fun.

42
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,570
Today, I want to do something really chill.

43
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,250
Today, I was just like, I don't know what I want to do.

44
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,390
Especially because I was like, I don't know how long Doki and I will be going for.

45
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,830
And so...

46
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,050
I was like, well, you know, I probably should...

47
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,230
I should... I should... What's the word?

48
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,530
I should not pace myself, but I should...

49
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,430
I should... Oh my gosh, what's happening?

50
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,610
I should first see... What are these?

51
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,390
I should first see how I'm feeling.

52
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,750
So it was between this and Astro Bot.

53
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,170
It was between this and Astro Bot.

54
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:28,970
Decompress.

55
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,650
Maybe.

56
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,450
Welcome to membership, thank you!

57
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:41,710
Yeah.

58
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:51,190
Only hour 8 into Minecraft live, but can confirm this is my new favorite stream of all time.

59
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,030
Funny because the previous title holder also involved two dorks playing Minecraft.

60
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,870
That was... It was just unbelievable how insane...

61
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,530
The stream turned out.

62
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,910
You know, I still feel a little stinky about having died to that drowned.

63
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,470
You know, I know some people are like, oh, this is why you don't play with shaders.

64
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,850
This is why you just play normal Minecraft because you would have been able to see the exit with the shaders on.

65
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,530
But honestly, if we had gotten to the stronghold, I think I would have just...

66
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,470
I would have just...

67
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,930
I would have just...

68
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,710
But it's okay.

69
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,850
You were fine, Minto.

70
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:39,890
Thanks.

71
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:40,790
Thank you.

72
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,270
The stronghold trials is BS.

73
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,970
We would have gotten in there and...

74
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,770
It would have probably been like another three hours, not gonna lie.

75
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,130
It probably would have been if we had survived.

76
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,490
It would have been like another three hours trying to find the portal.

77
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,270
Getting through the trials, maybe.

78
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,570
It would have been...

79
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:12,190
But anyway, if you're curious, if you're just like, what the heck is this annual ghost town pumpkin festival?

80
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,750
Minto, I don't know what this is.

81
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,670
I actually found this.

82
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:22,110
Okay, this is gonna sound stupid, but I get so many things that I find because my TikTok is not ultimately cursed.

83
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,370
It's only a little bit cursed.

84
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,730
And I actually found this on TikTok.

85
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:38,550
And it's like a yearly game that this dev puts out where people can join and carve pumpkins and then just walk around and meet other ghosts.

86
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,670
And it's just kind of cute.

87
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,730
And I was like, oh.

88
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,690
This seems fun.

89
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,650
And it has an escape room, which I've never done an escape room before ever, ever, ever, ever in my afterlife.

90
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,010
So I was like, I want to do one.

91
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,810
We can do escape room.

92
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,510
And lots of people can join.

93
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:00,630
So...

94
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,410
The game is free.

95
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,750
You just search the game on itch.io and you can find it.

96
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,730
But you can also donate to get extra...

97
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,890
Extra thingies.

98
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:17,110
Still watching the Minecraft collab and it is exactly the kind of stream that got me hooked on YouTube.

99
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,770
Make sure to rest up and never stop.

100
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,550
Thank you.

101
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,690
Thank you, Xanthox.

102
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,370
So...

103
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,270
You have to do an IRL.

104
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,510
There's so much fun with the right people.

105
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,730
I don't have...

106
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,190
People to do it with, maybe.

107
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,270
So...

108
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,470
I've always wanted to try it though.

109
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,890
I've always wanted to do one.

110
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,050
But...

111
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,350
Yeah.

112
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,570
I think my friends...

113
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,150
I don't know if my friends would like it.

114
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,110
It's my birthday today.

115
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,030
Happy birthday!

116
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,430
Happy birthday to you.

117
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,770
Happy birthday to you.

118
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,030
Happy birthday, dear Rejoy.

119
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,610
Happy birthday to you.

120
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,950
Happy birthday!

121
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:24,170
Yeah, so this is kind of Halloween themed, but it's also fall themed.

122
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,870
So it's fine.

123
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,670
And it's only one week.

124
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,370
I think today is the last day that we can play.

125
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,270
So, let's first design my ghost.

126
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:35,870
Oh, oh no.

127
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,010
Wait, you can't see my name.

128
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:40,670
Bleakly...

129
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,570
Bleakly is a bat.

130
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,770
What does that mean?

131
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,510
Wait, if I randomize, will it change my name too?

132
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:48,770
Smile.

133
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,550
Why is it giving me the Roblox smile?

134
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,190
The Moonlight Sonata, why?

135
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,730
I kind of like this one though.

136
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,730
Oh my god, I'm the Roblox smile man!

137
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,150
Let's see, which one fits me?

138
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:12,830
Oh, this one.

139
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,370
You guys!

140
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,210
Wait...

141
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,290
It's literally you!

142
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,410
It's literally you guys!

143
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,590
Let's see what hats we got.

144
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,230
Do they have a maid?

145
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,350
This might be the easiest.

146
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,950
Oh my god, we can become Toad!

147
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,910
I can't do the voice right now though.

148
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,130
I kind of want to be a nurse, that's a little sexy.

149
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,030
We're on the telly!

150
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,590
You're in the game!

151
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,040
There's no maid, that's so sad.

152
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,980
Oh, it needs to be unlocked in the festival.

153
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,900
Oh, interesting.

154
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,420
I can be a bunny girl.

155
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,560
I'll be a bunny girl, that's kind of sexy.

156
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,760
So, if you see me, I'm Bleakly, easy bat.

157
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,220
You can't change your name, that's just me.

158
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,380
That's just me.

159
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,660
I'm the bat.

160
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,320
I'm the bat ghost.

161
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,880
Cool!

162
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,300
Wait, some of the pumpkins disappeared, right?

163
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,840
Oh, they move around!

164
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,100
Alright, let's carve a pumpkin.

165
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Select a pumpkin to start carving.

166
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,560
Hot dog!

167
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,560
I rushed to finish all my work this week so I can go to Japan next week without guilt.

168
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,800
But that also means I get to fully experience yesterday's stream on the job.

169
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,440
Very well.

170
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,860
Otsu David!

171
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,140
Why do you have bunny ears, bat ghost?

172
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,220
I don't know.

173
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,440
I want something kind of ugly.

174
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,500
Like a misshapen pumpkin.

175
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,500
This one's kind of nice.

176
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,560
This one's huge!

177
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,360
I'm going to be the biggest pumpkin in the pumpkin patch.

178
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,140
Oh my gosh, guys.

179
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,780
What is this?

180
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,700
Toggle lighting.

181
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,560
Scrape and cut.

182
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,840
Visit the festival.

183
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,760
Save.

184
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,260
New pumpkin.

185
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,180
More.

186
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,760
Okay.

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,600
Okay.

188
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,520
Okay.

189
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,420
The Minecraft collab was low-key my dopamine dose to get me through finance month and work.

190
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:44,880
Thank you.

191
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,120
Ghost admin, thank you!

192
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,040
What should we... Okay.

193
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,200
What should we... What should we cut?

194
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,260
What should we...

195
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,580
What should we carve?

196
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,060
What should we carve?

197
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,280
Hello!

198
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,520
How are you doing?

199
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,380
It's my first stream.

200
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,220
Welcome, welcome!

201
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,620
Thanks for joining.

202
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,860
This stream was so much fun.

203
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm so glad you guys liked it.

204
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,260
Self-portrait?

205
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,720
Self-portrait.

206
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,000
Make the wisp, the funny wispy laugh?

207
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,500
What if I... Okay, hold on.

208
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,500
If I put this on, we can do this.

209
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:34,780
Okay.

210
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,540
Alright, I'm going to become... I'm going to do like a Metal Gear Minto.

211
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,900
Okay, Metal Gear Minto.

212
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,300
What a coincidence, it's my first stream too.

213
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,920
Oh my gosh, Todokete!

214
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,440
Name I've never seen before.

215
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,260
Welcome to stream!

216
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,220
Yeah, for anyone... Wait, what's this?

217
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,110
Wait, why can't I...

218
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,050
No, that's not what I wanted to do.

219
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,030
Wait, maybe I need to scrape.

220
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,290
Oh, interesting.

221
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,890
You can't control the size either, you just scrape.

222
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,750
For anyone wondering, I went to sleep around 7am, 7.30am.

223
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,670
I woke up at 10am.

224
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,650
No, I woke up at... Yes, that's true.

225
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,790
I woke up at 10am because my alarm went off.

226
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,790
And then I was like, no, two more hours.

227
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,990
And so I then...

228
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,670
I then slept until 12.

229
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,190
Okay, portrait of me.

230
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,700
Wearing the eyepatch.

231
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,900
Oh wait, I don't like that, that's ugly.

232
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,240
Gosh, pumpkins are hard, they're lumpy.

233
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,960
It's making my face all lumpy.

234
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,280
I look like an actual goblin.

235
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,700
Wait, I'm looking really... Is this what I look like?

236
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,080
I look like an actual goblin.

237
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,260
I look like a real goblin right now.

238
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,080
Okay, hold on.

239
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,680
And the cross.

240
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,700
It's warping, it's warping.

241
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,460
Did you guys carve some pumpkins?

242
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,840
I wanna go see your pumpkins in the world, okay?

243
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:51,940
But, you know, I might not get to... I wanna find them naturally, so don't be like, hey, go find my pumpkin.

244
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,100
Oh my god, it's warping, it's warping.

245
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,660
It's warping.

246
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,320
Is this my... Wait, is this my smile?

247
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
Or is this my...

248
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,780
What is this?

249
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,580
I have a double chin.

250
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,580
Wait, what did I do here?

251
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,740
Huh?

252
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,900
You're asking us?

253
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,500
It's outlined to show the hair behind.

254
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,500
Nah, we'll keep it as my smile.

255
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,860
My very wide smile.

256
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,360
My very wide smile.

257
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,140
Oh wait, I don't have to draw the ahoge?

258
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,840
Look at this, it's kind of genius.

259
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,020
This is the ahoge.

260
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,340
This is my ahoge.

261
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,140
That little top of the pumpkin.

262
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,720
I'm very... Wait, hold on, let me redo it then.

263
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,240
Like that.

264
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,520
See it?

265
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,960
See it, see it.

266
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,160
Mint has an ahoge.

267
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,800
Yeah.

268
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,520
I've had one since 1.0.

269
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,900
Well, I had one in 1.0.

270
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,240
And then I got rid of it, because I brushed my hair.

271
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,880
And then I gave up brushing my hair.

272
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,960
I said, I hate brushing my hair.

273
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,780
I'm going back, I don't care about brushing my hair.

274
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,800
And that's how I got the ahoge back.

275
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,500
It's our beloved wide smile, Minto.

276
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,820
And I have ribbons.

277
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,270
Ribbons, and then hair.

278
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:46,690
More hair.

279
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,670
Can I turn this, or...

280
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,670
Will everybody only get to see it, like, from...

281
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,110
One angle.

282
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,350
I can't see what I'm doing on the side.

283
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,270
I feel like I should cut out a part, though.

284
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,050
Maybe I should cut out the eye.

285
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,740
You can rotate it?

286
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,140
How?

287
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,940
Guys, it's just...

288
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,640
It's blowing in the breeze, okay?

289
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,480
Right click.

290
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,140
It's blowing in the breeze.

291
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,710
I'm gonna sign it.

292
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,110
Nice.

293
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,530
Now everybody will know it's me.

294
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,250
They'll be like, what?

295
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,670
That's her!

296
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,770
That's me right there!

297
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,490
Oh gosh.

298
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,810
You think anybody will want to watch me, though?

299
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,360
Maybe, hold on, let me write...

300
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,930
Wait, this is the last day, probably no one will see this.

301
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,250
But just in case someone sees it, I'm...

302
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,610
A...

303
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:33,570
Vtuber.

304
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,610
Be careful.

305
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,770
I don't want someone being like, oh, Mint Phantom, that's such a...

306
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,610
Striking and provocative...

307
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,130
Pumpkin, I should go check them out.

308
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,070
And then they see I'm a Vtuber and they're like...

309
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,610
Real jumpscare!

310
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,090
It's just a thought-provoking pumpkin here.

311
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,610
You know?

312
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,990
Do we have enough room for subscribe?

313
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,410
Oh, baby, yeah we do.

314
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,440
Sub...

315
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,540
Scribe...

316
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,800
Subscribe.

317
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,720
Oh, look, it's a follow the message, you know?

318
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,680
Put a QR code on it?

319
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,840
It's just an ad.

320
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,620
No, it's not.

321
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,620
Okay, um...

322
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,680
I gotta put my...

323
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,880
Itai kakushi on here.

324
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,880
And then my maid headdress.

325
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,940
Do you think it looks just like me?

326
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,760
Oh, wait, I tried to give myself eyelashes.

327
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,160
Bottom lashes.

328
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:56,960
Okay.

329
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,520
Oha Mint!

330
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,600
Oha Mint!

331
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,020
And then I gotta also be saluting.

332
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,000
Okay, you can't tell what that is.

333
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,380
Nevermind.

334
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,500
This should be good.

335
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,800
I think it's a good advertisement.

336
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,500
Subscribe.

337
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,540
Mint Phantom.

338
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,600
I'm a Vtuber.

339
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:17,580
Me.

340
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,420
Does this look good?

341
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,160
Save?

342
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,820
What if I save it?

343
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,220
What happens?

344
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,800
Name my creation.

345
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,180
Mint...

346
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,280
Pump...

347
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,860
Um...

348
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,500
Hold on.

349
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,640
We're still in the drawing.

350
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,600
Mint...

351
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,000
Fan-kin.

352
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,270
I think the first one's better.

353
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,310
Absolute Jack-o'-lantern.

354
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,250
If it ain't Saucy Jack.

355
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,870
Saucy Jack!

356
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,390
There we go!

357
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,690
It's Saucy Jack!

358
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,950
If it ain't Saucy Jack.

359
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,690
There we go!

360
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,430
Saved.

361
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,290
Alright guys, we're gonna go to the festival.

362
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,190
I'm nervous to go to the festival.

363
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,430
I'm excited though.

364
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,650
I'm excited.

365
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,050
Oh my gosh!

366
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,710
There's so many people here.

367
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,050
There's so many tiny people here.

368
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,390
What is that sound?

369
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,170
Oh my god.

370
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,090
Oh, people are...

371
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,010
Oh, what is that sound?

372
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,830
What is that clicky sound?

373
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,370
It's terrible.

374
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,890
Oh my god.

375
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,770
What is that sound?

376
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,290
Oh, it's horrible.

377
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,930
Oh my god.

378
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,290
Am I here?

379
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,290
Hold on.

380
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,670
Excuse me.

381
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,590
Oh, it's No-Face.

382
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,170
So cute.

383
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,330
What's this one?

384
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,510
Timidly Scruffy Pumpkin.

385
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,010
Oh, this one is fun.

386
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,950
Wait, excuse me.

387
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:25,650
I'm trying to say.

388
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,870
I'm not here.

389
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,890
What is this?

390
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,150
Revolting.

391
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,830
Is that like the check your engine light?

392
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,630
Oh, it's the camera shutter.

393
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,150
I can chat here.

394
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,370
I'm gonna freak.

395
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,860
Oh my god, you guys.

396
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,680
It's so annoying.

397
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,180
How do I turn off the camera sound?

398
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,360
Wait, I can place my pumpkin somewhere.

399
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,420
Hold on.

400
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,460
Audio.

401
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:03,580
Audio.

402
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,660
Oh, but I can't hear the ghost anymore I think, but it's peace and quiet.

403
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,840
Peace and quiet.

404
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,200
I don't get it, Paul.

405
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,680
Hello everybody!

406
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,320
Hello!

407
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,000
Hello!

408
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,340
Hello!

409
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:27,980
Hello!

410
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,480
Boo!

411
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,280
Boo!

412
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,040
Can I take a photo of you?

413
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,500
Sure!

414
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,300
This is weird.

415
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,540
This is like a real paparazzi experience.

416
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,520
Let's go explore some, you guys.

417
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,560
I haven't really been in here.

418
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,180
I just tested it out earlier.

419
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,260
I tested it out earlier to see if anybody was playing.

420
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,400
Read me.

421
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,600
And there was one other person.

422
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,440
And I said boo at them and they said, I'm a ghost.

423
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,840
Welcome to the 1004th Pumpkin Festival.

424
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,740
Look out for new areas like the Maze of Madness and the Hayride of Horror.

425
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,580
Feel free to report bugs on the Discord.

426
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,900
You can submit 6 more pumpkins to the festival.

427
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,100
Let's go place my pumpkin.

428
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:15,940
What's this?

429
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,960
Hayride of Horror.

430
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,840
Maze of Madness.

431
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,820
Jump on this thing.

432
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,300
Haunted house is spooky.

433
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,780
Award badges.

434
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,060
Do you recognize this spot?

435
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,420
Come back on Halloween night for a surprise.

436
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,080
Oh no, we missed it.

437
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,880
Play the guessing game.

438
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,360
What's the guessing game?

439
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,440
Oh wow.

440
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,180
Wow, how did they carve them so well?

441
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,640
Maybe I should have carved more.

442
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,080
Guys, I didn't carve enough.

443
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,080
Flowey, Saiyan's Undertale.

444
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,020
Where can I place mine?

445
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,620
Isn't there also...

446
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,760
Oh yeah, so there's different...

447
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,440
Yeah, there's different universes.

448
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,620
So we're in the classic world.

449
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,660
Are they all the same or are they just different servers?

450
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,120
So like if I went to the Forbidden World or the Forgotten World...

451
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,140
They're all the same?

452
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,540
Oh, this world is full.

453
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,400
It only says there's 95 people though.

454
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,460
How are you so tiny?

455
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,960
Slightly crooked enigma.

456
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,160
How are you small?

457
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,940
How are you so small?

458
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,280
What are you doing over here?

459
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,740
Are you shy?

460
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,640
Look, everybody is going around.

461
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,980
Hey, go away.

462
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,100
There's a creeper in the bathroom.

463
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,260
I wanted to put mine in there.

464
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,040
I wanted to put mine in there.

465
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,740
You scared him.

466
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,620
Look at all these pumpkins.

467
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,000
This is so cute.

468
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,060
What's this?

469
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,380
Happy Halloween.

470
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,940
I can't go inside.

471
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,600
Oh, but I can look.

472
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:57,940
I think.

473
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,860
Maybe we can go inside back here.

474
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,460
Oh, maybe.

475
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,720
How do we get in?

476
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,960
Do I have to like dig?

477
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,400
A mushroom.

478
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,860
Look out for a mushroom.

479
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,360
I want to go in here.

480
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,060
Oh my goodness.

481
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,440
Spooky sounds.

482
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,780
This is so cute.

483
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,620
What's in here?

484
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,400
Check a tree.

485
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,800
Pumpkin festival.

486
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:30,820
Carve pumpkins.

487
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,520
Show them off on the world wide web.

488
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,120
Welcome to scenic ghost town.

489
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,560
There's nobody here, TM.

490
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,400
Oh, is this your house?

491
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:39,660
Sorry.

492
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,440
Wow.

493
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,660
Oh, what's over here?

494
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,940
You forgot the pickles.

495
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,560
That's funny.

496
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,380
I like that one.

497
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,100
How do you fly?

498
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,400
How do you fly?

499
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,040
Oh my gosh.

500
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,960
What is this?

501
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,880
What is this?

502
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,220
We are on the...

503
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,160
Hey, I want to be able to see.

504
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Here, I'm going to jump on.

505
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,340
Oh my god.

506
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,560
A skelly is driving this thing.

507
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,960
Sorry, I think I toggled the light in the world by trying to shift.

508
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,840
I'm trying to see.

509
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,780
Where are we going?

510
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,320
Welcome, Dusty.

511
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,120
What are you trying to say about me?

512
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,980
I'm Dusty?

513
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,820
Go away, computer.

514
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,500
Oh, I'm falling off.

515
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,040
I'm trying to get up top.

516
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,100
How do you guys get up top?

517
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,110
But fine.

518
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:44,810
OK, fine.

519
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,170
You know what?

520
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:45,850
I'll just sit here.

521
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,110
We are going into the hayride of horror!

522
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,910
Wait, will I be able to hear any sound effects?

523
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,530
Metal gear!

524
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,290
Hey, I can't see!

525
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,680
Who is driving this thing?

526
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:08,800
Oh my god.

527
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,800
I don't hear any... OK, I think I have to turn the sound effects on.

528
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,940
But you guys, can you not take pictures then?

529
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,260
Don't take pictures, because the sound is annoying.

530
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,320
Sorry, I clicked the main... Sorry, I'm really sleepy.

531
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,320
I'm so sorry.

532
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,620
I didn't mean to click the main menu instead.

533
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,540
Skull face monologuing in front of Venom.

534
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,900
Sorry, I meant to go back to the settings.

535
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,120
OK, I can do it here though.

536
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,760
If you are going to take a picture, just like... Here, I'll even turn it to like 80.

537
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,240
There we go.

538
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,160
Just do a screenshot, otherwise the sound is just too annoying.

539
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,600
Hey!

540
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,040
Were you waiting here to say that?

541
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,740
That's crazy.

542
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,560
I'd rather be watching anime?

543
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,700
You could say that?

544
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,020
There are so many things here.

545
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,800
Wait, anime... What about VTuber?

546
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,740
Oh, there is nothing about VTubers.

547
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,300
I'd rather be... Where is your pumpkin?

548
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,340
I'm a... I'm a spooky ghost.

549
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,800
Do you think I'm rambunctious?

550
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,760
Is that what that said?

551
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,360
These are so random.

552
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,800
There are so many things here though.

553
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,900
This is really tricky.

554
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,800
You must have a big brain.

555
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,620
My brain is nice and smooth.

556
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,020
VTubers are niche?

557
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,840
You think so?

558
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,500
How did we get to that A-Ride?

559
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,420
How do you flow, you guys?

560
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,140
I don't know how to do anything.

561
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,480
Oh, there it is!

562
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,320
Welcome to Dusty Fields.

563
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,860
I'm going!

564
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,100
I'm going!

565
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,590
Here we go.

566
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,130
Time for Haunted House.

567
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,090
Welcome, Dusty.

568
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,970
Click on a mushroom.

569
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:21,930
A mushroom?

570
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,150
It's hazardous, you guys.

571
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,070
Be careful in here.

572
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,290
Something screamed.

573
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,770
Oh my god, this spider is laughing at me.

574
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,390
And then there is the scene from the bridge in Metal Gear Solid.

575
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,390
Three.

576
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,450
I can't see.

577
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,470
Her hats are in the way.

578
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,130
Oh my god.

579
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,330
Who the hell is that?

580
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,770
Why is there a dog in here?

581
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,750
No!

582
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,890
Oh my god, that's a real horror.

583
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,470
That's a real scariness.

584
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,430
Oh my god.

585
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,030
Sexy.

586
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,270
I think we are interrupting something here.

587
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,110
Oh, what's that?

588
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:08,990
Alien!

589
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,410
Oh my gosh.

590
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,690
What a freak.

591
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,890
Stop being weird!

592
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,010
Oh my gosh, it's a witch!

593
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,410
What's over here?

594
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:23,670
Cemetery.

595
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,670
Of course there would be a cemetery in the ghost town, right?

596
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,630
Hey, get out.

597
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,450
Get your big head out of my face.

598
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,070
That scared me.

599
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:40,910
That's me right now.

600
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,970
Congratulations, you survived the hayride of horror!

601
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,070
We did it!

602
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,090
We did it!

603
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,350
We did it!

604
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,490
Oh my gosh.

605
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,670
I think there is a selfie cam.

606
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,170
Wait.

607
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,390
Look at me!

608
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,430
Look at me!

609
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,370
Look at me!

610
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,670
Wait, can I zoom out?

611
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,530
How can I take a picture with... Oh my god.

612
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,730
There we go.

613
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,450
Hey, you can take your photos, I guess.

614
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,470
Oh, there we go.

615
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,550
What's this one?

616
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,570
Hold on, what's the other side?

617
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,590
Oh, I know I want to be Frankenstein.

618
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,830
Get out of the way, I'm Frankenstein.

619
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,450
Freaking paparazzi up in here.

620
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,590
I know.

621
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,340
These are so cute.

622
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,340
Get all your pictures everybody.

623
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,580
I keep wanting to sprint.

624
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:50,920
Oh my gosh.

625
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,280
But when you press shift...

626
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,920
It just...

627
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,060
Oh my gosh, I think I'm going to sneeze.

628
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,060
It changes the light.

629
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,080
Flashbang in 3, 2, 1.

630
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,540
Wait, can I go through the hayride of horrors without...

631
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,000
Ride may be too spooky for children under 10.

632
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,540
Oh my gosh, I can.

633
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,060
Can I go inside this house?

634
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,820
Oh my gosh.

635
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,560
There is a man here.

636
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,100
Let me out of here.

637
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,600
Get me out of here.

638
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,660
Oh god, I'm going to get run over.

639
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:49,450
I didn't even notice this guy here when we were on it before.

640
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,970
How do I find a mushroom?

641
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,690
I'm searching for a mushroom in the woods.

642
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,150
I like the alien.

643
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,570
It might be my favorite one.

644
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,240
Winnie the Pooh?

645
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,060
Oh, it is Winnie the Pooh.

646
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,160
This one is funny.

647
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,620
Oh, that's so good.

648
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,040
Look at the alien ones.

649
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,920
What are these creatures?

650
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,080
It's so interesting.

651
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,520
Hold on, I'm turning on the lights again.

652
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,020
3, 2, 1.

653
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,970
Oh my gosh, there is one even under there.

654
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,820
How is the family reunion going?

655
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,720
It's craziness.

656
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,480
I don't recognize any of these relatives.

657
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,350
How do we find a mushroom?

658
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,530
Oh, I found a mushroom.

659
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,570
Oh, I'm still in photo mode.

660
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,110
No!

661
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,350
I want to be able to float.

662
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,670
How do I float, you guys?

663
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,990
How do you guys fly in the air?

664
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,310
How are you guys doing that?

665
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,950
There are like little popcorns everywhere.

666
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,850
You have to be small to float?

667
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,810
I saw some big people.

668
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,190
Oh, I'm going to spoil myself for the...

669
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,350
There is a jump thing that they talked about too.

670
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,750
Let's go over here.

671
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:28,830
What was this?

672
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,410
Wait, I don't want to be small anymore.

673
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:37,730
Help!

674
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,110
Help!

675
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,110
I'm going too fast!

676
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,490
I don't want to be small.

677
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,790
Reserved for who?

678
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,630
Oh my god.

679
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,570
I don't want to be small.

680
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,790
Where do I become big?

681
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,850
It's too much.

682
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,030
Help me!

683
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,770
Back of the house.

684
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,750
Which house?

685
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:05,030
Which house was it?

686
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,280
I'm looking.

687
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,320
I see nothing.

688
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,360
Oh gosh.

689
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,700
I'm too small.

690
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,380
I want to be big again.

691
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,360
Oh here.

692
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,840
I'm normal.

693
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,740
Now we got to find out how to get back to that area.

694
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,180
Over here.

695
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,220
I think you need to figure out how to be tall before your afterlife.

696
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,740
Shut up!

697
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,850
We can go through here, right?

698
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:50,570
Oh yeah, we can.

699
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,130
Pumpkins are spawning in.

700
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,830
Oh there is another photo spot.

701
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,190
Oh my gosh.

702
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,990
We can be witches.

703
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:01,910
Anime cat.

704
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,850
Parkour.

705
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:06,870
Ok, nevermind.

706
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,330
I'm still...maybe I need to be...parkour.

707
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,550
Oh, sorry guys.

708
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,050
Nice.

709
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:18,330
Hmm.

710
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,750
Wait, no.

711
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Want to guess which is my pumpkin?

712
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,600
Oh you guys are taking pictures here.

713
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,520
Oh my gosh, it can be a little cat!

714
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,760
That's so cute!

715
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,000
I can see it.

716
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,000
Let's see what's over here.

717
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,320
Are there secrets?

718
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,440
Are there any secrets in the beyond?

719
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,800
Woah!

720
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,560
Oh my god!

721
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,430
Oh my god.

722
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,070
Look at them go!

723
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
This guy is not amused.

724
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,760
Yeah buddy, get it going.

725
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,140
You've got this.

726
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,500
Oh, this one is actually my favorite.

727
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,000
Actually, wait.

728
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,700
This guy is really schmovin'.

729
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,400
Actually, I think this guy is my favorite.

730
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,940
He doesn't know at all.

731
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,220
He's not on beat or anything.

732
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,580
Oh wait, nevermind.

733
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,540
Oh he is on beat.

734
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,780
He's got this.

735
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,340
Go!

736
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:14,740
Go!

737
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,160
Go!

738
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:15,940
Go!

739
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:16,420
Go!

740
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:16,820
Go!

741
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,240
Go!

742
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,980
I'm with my friends!

743
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,430
I have a spooky ghost.

744
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:29,490
Oh, I didn't notice you too.

745
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,070
Oh yeah!

746
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,180
What are you doing over here, you scaredy?

747
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,040
Just foolish friend.

748
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,100
What are you doing over here?

749
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,300
Everybody say hi then.

750
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,380
Village shop.

751
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,120
E shop.

752
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:02,880
E shoppy.

753
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,600
What's in here?

754
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,680
Oh.

755
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,740
Aliens are real.

756
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,180
Stop paying rent.

757
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,560
Wow!

758
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,820
This is my favorite channel!

759
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,740
Oh my gosh!

760
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,440
Yeah!

761
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,000
I like hearing the guys go woo.

762
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:47,680
What does it say?

763
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,340
Run?

764
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,800
And then they couldn't write anything else.

765
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,360
I like... Oh they put this behind the tree so it looks like a cat is peeking out from the tree.

766
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,640
That's so silly.

767
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,300
I love that.

768
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,080
Have you seen this man?

769
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,480
He owes me $82.

770
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,580
No sferatu.

771
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,640
What is this?

772
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,960
The evil manor.

773
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:21,740
Oh!

774
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,860
This must be the... Wait, hold on.

775
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,660
Wait, I can't read it.

776
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,500
You guys are in the way.

777
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,700
I can't read it.

778
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,820
You guys are in the way.

779
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,520
Please let me read it.

780
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,940
Please let me read the rules.

781
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,780
Wait.

782
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,500
We'll come back.

783
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,080
I didn't want to do it right now anyway.

784
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,920
There was something else over here.

785
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,460
There was like that jump thing too.

786
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,440
But I got distracted by the skellies.

787
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,500
There was a jump thing.

788
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,360
I saw it from over here.

789
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,840
It was like a big tower.

790
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,820
Not this though, I don't think.

791
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,820
I don't know actually.

792
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,150
Oh, you can go up there?

793
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,650
Wasn't there like a jump... Oh my god, I surprised Pikachu.

794
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,970
Wasn't there a jump tower?

795
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,450
It said to go to the jump tower.

796
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:44,550
Oh gosh, it actually made my stomach drop.

797
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:49,990
I thought I saw it.

798
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:50,990
It's on the other side of the map.

799
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:51,630
Oh, it is?

800
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,370
I'll go check it out.

801
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,970
Oh, I like this one.

802
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,470
It's pretty.

803
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,930
I was taking pictures behind me.

804
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,150
That's weird.

805
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,890
Don't just take pictures of my ass.

806
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,170
Hey, what is this?

807
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:16,550
The Barn of Terror?

808
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,630
What is this?

809
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,070
There is a big old spooky ghost... not ghost, skelly.

810
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,510
There is another skelly.

811
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,970
He is giving a thumbs up.

812
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,050
What is this?

813
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,190
Who is laughing?

814
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,190
Who is laughing?

815
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:50,150
I like how the audio is very clearly coming from here.

816
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:51,930
Is this it?

817
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:54,930
It's just another room?

818
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:57,570
I guess?

819
00:44:59,110 --> 00:44:59,890
Weezer?

820
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,180
I see.

821
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:06,760
Weezer.

822
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,200
Shrek!

823
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,860
Wait, I hear something over here.

824
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,980
Oh my gosh, we can also be a part of Metal Gear Solid 3.

825
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,520
Or maybe it's the Lion King.

826
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,940
I don't see the jump area.

827
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,740
Am I going crazy?

828
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,400
I don't see it.

829
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:40,170
Oh my gosh, it's the boss and she is kicking...

830
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:44,870
She kicked Snake off the...

831
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:47,470
The bridge.

832
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,370
Oh, I see it over there.

833
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:51,810
I think.

834
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,430
Hot dog, thank you.

835
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:59,950
Speaking of stummy, happy good tummy day.

836
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:06,830
Memento perchance showeth the stummy toggle that you teased on Twitter beforeth.

837
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:10,850
Oh, there is a maze.

838
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:12,570
Okay.

839
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,490
I'm gonna go through the maze.

840
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,190
Wait, before I do...

841
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:21,450
Before I do, I do want to see if any of the other...

842
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:25,450
Worlds, the universes are...

843
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,950
If they have anything.

844
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:30,230
So where do we go?

845
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,510
To the mysterious world?

846
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:35,750
I kind of want to go to the forbidden world because you can't tell me to not go to the forbidden...

847
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,450
Or you can't say forbidden world and then it's...

848
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:44,910
Sorry, and then, you know...

849
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,250
You can't let me go.

850
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,280
They have more pumpkin space?

851
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,320
Over here, in the forbidden world.

852
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,060
The pumpkins are here.

853
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,820
So, actually, someone asked me this before.

854
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,340
What the hell?

855
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,480
This is just a normal-ass pumpkin.

856
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:04,860
Nevermind.

857
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,140
Someone asked me before because I once posted a picture.

858
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,440
Or rather, I think I showed it to you of me.

859
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,700
Oh, it is all the same.

860
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,800
But there is lots of space.

861
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,360
Oh my gosh, I can put mine right here.

862
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,350
Bring your pumpkins to the festival.

863
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:27,910
Choose a pumpkin.

864
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,990
The universe is almost full.

865
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:33,250
No, I don't.

866
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:35,670
Hey!

867
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,130
What's wrong with you guys?

868
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:38,030
You assholes!

869
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:39,670
What?

870
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,250
Wait, where did all these pumpkins come from?

871
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:42,670
This can't be all you.

872
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:43,550
Wait, huh?

873
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,810
It was completely empty just two seconds ago.

874
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:46,970
What just happened?

875
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,410
Oh, it didn't load in yet.

876
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:50,450
Oh...

877
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:59,610
I thought...

878
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,450
The skeletons have a spot?

879
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:01,750
OK.

880
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:07,630
But someone asked if I could take my skirt off before once.

881
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,430
And I...

882
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,370
Can.

883
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:17,890
Wisp love!

884
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:19,630
Oh my god!

885
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:23,170
OK, this is the... The wisps take over this area.

886
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,190
Oh my god, they are loading in again.

887
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:26,110
What's happening?

888
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:30,570
And...

889
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:33,790
I can take off my skirt, kind of.

890
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:36,170
I can't show you the apron because...

891
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,530
I'll just be full coochie out.

892
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,230
And I don't think YouTube would like that very much.

893
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:43,510
So...

894
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:49,330
So...

895
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:51,030
Oh my god.

896
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,890
So I can't show you my stomach or else I'll just be naked.

897
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,510
I have to take off all my clothes.

898
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,840
There's room up here?

899
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,640
On the cliff?

900
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,580
I can't tell if they are loaded in or not.

901
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,160
I'm gonna go right here.

902
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,460
Place my pumpkin, sausage jack.

903
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,180
Place.

904
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:28,660
Place.

905
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,080
Place.

906
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,720
Place pumpkin.

907
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,460
Place pumpkin.

908
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,980
Place pumpkin.

909
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,280
Why won't it let me place it?

910
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,020
Place pumpkin.

911
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,600
Oh, I have to pick a spot.

912
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,620
Oh, I see, I see.

913
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,800
Place pumpkin.

914
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:54,210
I'll have my face showing.

915
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,970
There it is!

916
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:57,670
My pumpkin!

917
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:01,310
It's in the forbidden world, everybody.

918
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:03,730
Team Stummy defeated.

919
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:09,870
So I can only show you my stummy on Twitter because, you know...

920
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:12,750
Like I said, it's, you know, all my clothes off and stuff.

921
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:30,630
My innocence.

922
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:32,470
No, I'm saving you.

923
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,830
There's four festival activities you can do to collect pins for your hat.

924
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:38,030
Ride the hayride.

925
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,070
Pins are next to the exit sign.

926
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:43,370
Oh, wait, where was the hayride over here, right?

927
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:51,930
A jump, parkour tower, a maze and the escape room mansion.

928
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,530
Okay, I want to do the escape room mansion last.

929
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:58,430
So... Oh my gosh.

930
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,290
Guys, how do I look?

931
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,710
Why do you look the sussiest face ever?

932
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,270
Why do you have the sussiest face ever?

933
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,370
Why do you...

934
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:22,890
This is so stupid.

935
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:26,270
They're all suss... Oh my gosh, they just become this...

936
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:31,090
Amalgamation of faces.

937
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:35,590
Okay, where was the hayride?

938
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:37,350
Sorry, I'm getting so lost in here.

939
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,370
It's not even like that big of an area, but for me I'm just like...

940
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:43,370
I'm lost.

941
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:46,750
Oh, here it is.

942
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:47,090
Over here.

943
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:47,550
Yeah, yeah.

944
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,970
Okay, so that's the maze.

945
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,450
We'll go in that after I get my pin.

946
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,130
What's this?

947
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:54,050
Trick or treat!

948
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,370
Let's go get the pin.

949
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,430
Pin for my hat.

950
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:05,050
Here?

951
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:06,030
On this thing?

952
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:09,010
Congratulations.

953
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:10,210
Oh, free pin!

954
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:13,770
I screamed on the haunted hayride.

955
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:15,150
You collected a pin.

956
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,470
Now you can equip a special hat.

957
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:18,810
Oh, thank you!

958
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:23,030
Let's go through the...

959
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:25,830
The maze.

960
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:32,650
If you want, you can give medals to pumpkins by pressing escape and clicking on the medal.

961
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,770
Oh, everybody's gotta give me medals.

962
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,550
What the hell happened to this guy?

963
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:37,670
Oh, wait.

964
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:38,030
Hold on.

965
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:38,630
Let me read.

966
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,650
The maze of madness.

967
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:42,050
Enter if you dare.

968
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:45,570
Oh, there's something in the middle.

969
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:46,110
Okay.

970
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:49,270
In case of emergency, hit me up.

971
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:50,810
Ignorance is folly.

972
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,220
I'm never gonna remember.

973
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,240
Let's just get lost.

974
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,720
One of the best things about mazes is to just get lost in it, you know?

975
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:10,390
Ow!

976
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:11,390
Get out of here.

977
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,330
We're just gonna get lost in it.

978
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:14,670
See?

979
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,650
These guys are not small and they're floating.

980
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:20,150
You guys said I had to be small to float, but they're big.

981
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:26,490
I love peanuts.

982
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:27,810
Snoopy.

983
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,560
Maze.

984
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:36,500
Maze.

985
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,580
We're in the maze.

986
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:39,600
Maze.

987
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,080
Peanuts.

988
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,820
Wait, did I go... Oh!

989
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:50,300
That was actually spooky with like how spooky the music was all of a sudden.

990
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,200
That was actually kind of spooky.

991
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,460
What the heck just happened?

992
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,180
Is it right here?

993
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,340
Is this where we're trying to get to?

994
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,320
Oh no, that's the entrance.

995
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,880
Here lies your mom.

996
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,200
Oh, sorry.

997
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:08,760
Hold on, guys.

998
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,100
My YouTube froze again.

999
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,800
As it does.

1000
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,300
As it tends to do.

1001
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,080
I want to say, though.

1002
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,960
I do want to say again, though, that this is a free game.

1003
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,660
You can check out the pinned message.

1004
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,080
But it can accompany... Like 500 people or so can join in.

1005
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,440
So if you are like, how do I get in?

1006
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,960
How do I play with you guys?

1007
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,140
Feel free to join, you know?

1008
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,320
Okay, there we go.

1009
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,860
Oh, this ghost wants to challenge you to the guessing game.

1010
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,620
What's the guessing game?

1011
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,620
The other ghosts will pick a pumpkin they've created on the map.

1012
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,500
They'll give you up to five hints and you have to try and guess which pumpkin is theirs.

1013
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:56,740
Oh.

1014
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,420
Okay.

1015
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,920
I need a hint.

1016
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,520
My pumpkin is very cute.

1017
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,000
I need a hint.

1018
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,560
Speak!

1019
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,290
You're far away.

1020
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:37,390
I'm far away.

1021
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:41,690
I'm far away.

1022
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:44,210
Gnome!

1023
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,550
How are you guys floating?

1024
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,390
I can't get up as high as you guys.

1025
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,090
What?

1026
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:57,790
I wave my pookie.

1027
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:02,930
What the hell?

1028
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,210
Is it in the maze?

1029
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:10,290
Is it in the maze?

1030
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:12,810
Your pumpkin!

1031
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,660
Sad.

1032
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,440
Is it this one?

1033
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:26,600
Incorrect.

1034
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,300
Oh my god.

1035
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,360
My pumpkin is full of sadness.

1036
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,940
What does that mean?

1037
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,380
Was it the wisp pumpkin there?

1038
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,460
The dancing skelly?

1039
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,540
Oh, let's go see.

1040
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,800
I can't get out of the maze though.

1041
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,800
I'm actually stuck.

1042
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,080
Wait, I keep going in circles.

1043
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,180
My pumpkin might remind you of a friend.

1044
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:03,910
Is it in the maze?

1045
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,250
There is nothing even on this pumpkin.

1046
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:16,870
I didn't even carve anything.

1047
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,950
What's going on in there?

1048
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,850
Oh my god!

1049
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,540
This one reminds me... Oh my god!

1050
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,820
Look, it's a big boss right there.

1051
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,000
Let's keep going.

1052
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,280
I'm trying to find the pumpkin.

1053
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,600
It's gotta be in the maze, right?

1054
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,000
It's a maze pumpkin.

1055
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,560
Oh my gosh.

1056
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:55,480
Hello.

1057
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,400
Where did I come from?

1058
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,040
Why is there just a random pumpkin in the middle of the walkway?

1059
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:12,660
A

1060
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,440
wisp!

1061
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,440
There is another wisp pumpkin.

1062
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,580
It's so cute.

1063
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,060
Shut up.

1064
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,340
Stop laughing at me.

1065
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,460
Oh wait, I'm gonna ignore requests for now.

1066
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,320
Thank you though.

1067
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:44,040
I didn't know it would like... I thought I accidentally clicked on someone and that's why the request came.

1068
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:50,090
There is too many pumpkins for me to know.

1069
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:52,530
And the hints kind of suck.

1070
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,130
The hints kind of suck.

1071
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,290
Look how cute it is!

1072
00:58:58,350 --> 00:58:59,170
Look how cute!

1073
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:05,770
Alright, let's see.

1074
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:11,910
How do we get to the middle of this maze, guys?

1075
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:13,910
How do we get to the middle?

1076
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:15,310
How do we get to...

1077
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:16,950
Oh no, I got gnomed.

1078
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,630
How are you guys floating so high?

1079
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:23,850
What's this?

1080
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:26,490
Spooky.

1081
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,350
Nope.

1082
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:38,550
I've never been in a real hedge maze before.

1083
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:44,410
Oh they are standing on the hedge tops.

1084
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,690
How do you get up there?

1085
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:50,670
Is this the egg?

1086
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:51,750
Is this the...

1087
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:51,930
Oh.

1088
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,400
Wait, I forgot that we can look at the names of the things.

1089
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,720
The names of the... What's it called?

1090
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:10,920
You cheesed it.

1091
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:11,880
I didn't mean to.

1092
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,160
The names of the pumpkins.

1093
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,140
I gotta go back and see what the names of the wisps pumpkins are.

1094
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,240
No?

1095
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:18,860
What's up here?

1096
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,200
Wait, I want to see more pumpkins.

1097
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,700
Now I feel like I have to look at all of them.

1098
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,800
Their secret...

1099
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,280
Sorry, I got something in my throat.

1100
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:55,740
Sorry.

1101
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,720
I got something in my throat.

1102
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,040
I wonder what it's called.

1103
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,620
Too Pleasant Pumpkin.

1104
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,160
What does that even mean?

1105
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:10,700
Woah.

1106
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,120
Oh my god.

1107
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,860
Oh, I thought that did not say beet.

1108
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,000
I thought it definitely said something else.

1109
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,640
That doesn't make any sense.

1110
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,600
Oh, is that Isabelle?

1111
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,860
Pretty Appalling Pumpkin.

1112
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,640
Wait, they don't say the names of the actual names?

1113
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,240
Like they won't say Saucy Jack for my pumpkin name?

1114
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,560
No.

1115
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:37,680
No.

1116
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,500
But it's called Saucy Jack.

1117
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:43,520
No.

1118
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,840
Oh my gosh, it keeps going up.

1119
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,880
Keeps going up.

1120
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,400
You need to change the settings.

1121
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:55,800
Oh.

1122
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:03,250
Oh.

1123
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:04,770
Like a festival?

1124
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:05,430
Oh.

1125
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,210
Pumpkin names, real.

1126
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:10,110
Oh, okay, okay.

1127
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:10,690
Thank you.

1128
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:12,530
Oh, there we go.

1129
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:12,890
Perfect.

1130
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:18,490
Ah, now we can go see what the names are.

1131
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:22,110
Free Pin!

1132
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:25,030
I lost myself in that maze.

1133
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,530
Lol, where am I?

1134
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:30,810
We made it to the top.

1135
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:32,490
Wait, I'm trying to see the pumpkins, you guys.

1136
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:35,190
Trying to see the pumpkins.

1137
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:36,210
Roblox face.

1138
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:40,070
It's just some numbers.

1139
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:41,510
It's kind of cryptic.

1140
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:43,650
It's kind of cryptic.

1141
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:48,810
Wow.

1142
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,070
Oh, there's people down there.

1143
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,550
Oh, don't get lost.

1144
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,010
Hold on, let's go see what that one was called.

1145
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:01,370
Oh, it makes my stomach drop.

1146
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:05,230
It makes my stomach drop for real.

1147
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:15,470
I gotta get out of here.

1148
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:17,190
Let's go find that wisp.

1149
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:20,230
Where was the wisp at?

1150
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:22,650
Where was the wisp at?

1151
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,170
There we go.

1152
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:27,730
Wisp!

1153
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,410
You were somewhere over here.

1154
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:30,770
Wisp!

1155
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:32,930
If you guys find him, crowd around the wisp.

1156
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,870
If you find him, crowd around the wisp.

1157
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,330
I wanna see what his name is.

1158
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,440
I'm starting over.

1159
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,440
Seems like a nice fella.

1160
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:53,920
I don't know about that.

1161
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,180
Oh my gosh!

1162
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:57,680
Cute!

1163
01:03:58,580 --> 01:03:59,960
The cool ass.

1164
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:06,560
Yeah.

1165
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:08,800
Saucy Jack.

1166
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:09,840
That's mine.

1167
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:10,900
People will see it.

1168
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,580
Maybe not though.

1169
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,680
Maybe no one will see it.

1170
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,460
It's the last day.

1171
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,700
I wish I had known about this sooner.

1172
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:24,420
I'm jumping by the wisp.

1173
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,720
Oh gosh, I'm trapped.

1174
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,300
Hold on.

1175
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,280
I'm looking at other ones.

1176
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:32,360
Oogie boogie!

1177
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,740
Wait, I'm trapped?

1178
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,480
OK, hold on.

1179
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,400
Where is the wisp?

1180
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,860
Have you seen any other ones?

1181
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:47,900
Over there?

1182
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,020
Oh my gosh.

1183
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,140
I see many people jumping over there.

1184
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,160
Oh no!

1185
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,880
I failed the parkour!

1186
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:03,810
How will I become Minecraft parkour champion like this?

1187
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:07,330
Yeah,

1188
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,060
you are an odd ghost.

1189
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,740
You are an odd ghost.

1190
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,560
You're all like it.

1191
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:25,910
Get out of here.

1192
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:33,410
Can't you draw anything else?

1193
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:43,600
Hold on.

1194
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,340
Oh gosh, I have to get back up again.

1195
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:49,140
Oh, it's a nerd pumpkin.

1196
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,600
It's not big enough.

1197
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:52,800
Hold on.

1198
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:53,960
I have to get back up.

1199
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:57,420
They are easy to make?

1200
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,520
So is the wisp.

1201
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,100
The wisp is easy to make.

1202
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:02,540
Up.

1203
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,840
I'm stuck.

1204
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,900
I'm stuck.

1205
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,980
Wait, what's this one called?

1206
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:13,700
Big boss.

1207
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,600
Oh, it's a pirate.

1208
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,300
Man!

1209
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:22,140
I'm trying to get there!

1210
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:22,620
I'm coming!

1211
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,860
Don't leave!

1212
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,100
Stay right there!

1213
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,760
I'm on my way.

1214
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:30,480
This way.

1215
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:35,700
Maybe.

1216
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:36,440
No!

1217
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:37,840
Not this way.

1218
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:39,000
I'm coming!

1219
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,520
This way.

1220
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,380
This way?

1221
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,720
This way.

1222
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:49,820
I'm on my way.

1223
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,120
I'm on my way.

1224
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,280
I'm on my way.

1225
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:56,460
Yeah!

1226
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:57,880
I'm stuck.

1227
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,360
Wisp tool.

1228
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,160
Now we have to go to the other wisp.

1229
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,300
Wait, I have to get out of here.

1230
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,160
I have to find a gnome.

1231
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:11,900
Gnome!

1232
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,500
Where is a gnome when you need one?

1233
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,580
Where is a gnome when you need one?

1234
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,320
Oh my gosh.

1235
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,360
I found it.

1236
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,380
Thanks guys for chilling by it.

1237
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:26,680
What is this one?

1238
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:27,720
Oh my gosh!

1239
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,500
It was a yukuri!

1240
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,080
I thought it was a yukuri, but...

1241
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,320
OK.

1242
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:32,960
Alright.

1243
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,320
Guys, you gotta give me some space so I can see.

1244
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,680
You guys gotta give me some space so I can see.

1245
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:41,300
OK.

1246
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,960
Exit is...

1247
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,120
Which way is the exit?

1248
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:47,360
That?

1249
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:48,080
No.

1250
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,280
What's the exit?

1251
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:01,570
That's the jumpy thing, so let's go over there.

1252
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:02,970
Oh!

1253
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:03,550
Oopsie.

1254
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:04,090
OK.

1255
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:06,350
We'll find a gnome eventually.

1256
01:08:07,490 --> 01:08:08,110
Probably.

1257
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:13,340
It's a lot of ghosts.

1258
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,960
I know it's bopping up in here.

1259
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,000
Gnome!

1260
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,640
Oh my god!

1261
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,580
We've completely taken over this entire...

1262
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,160
We've taken over this server.

1263
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,940
We are the... Oh, I already like this.

1264
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,240
This forbidden...

1265
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:42,040
The forbidden area is our area.

1266
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,340
Smug pumpkin.

1267
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:45,760
Wait, what does it say?

1268
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:49,060
Oh, platypus!

1269
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,660
Thank you!

1270
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:56,440
The forbidden world is ours, everybody.

1271
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:58,780
OK.

1272
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,000
Let's go to the parkour, which was...

1273
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:03,700
Up here?

1274
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:04,700
I guess?

1275
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,620
Oh, this area is here.

1276
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:06,900
OK.

1277
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,440
Oh, there is a...

1278
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,000
There is a staircase.

1279
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:11,700
Just kidding.

1280
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,460
OK, here we go.

1281
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,060
Look at all these.

1282
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,000
They are so cute.

1283
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,220
Phantom!

1284
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,220
That's me!

1285
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,580
I'm starting to get so sleepy though, guys.

1286
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,120
So I'm gonna...

1287
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,300
Do the parkour?

1288
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,100
Did I do the haunted... What else was there?

1289
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,420
We did the maze.

1290
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,220
The parkour.

1291
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,300
We do the...

1292
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,740
The haunted house and the...

1293
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:53,000
Parkour and escape room.

1294
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:53,580
OK, perfect.

1295
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,080
This is the parkour?

1296
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:56,440
I'm guessing.

1297
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,020
Oh, there is so many here.

1298
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:03,780
Chat.

1299
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:09,440
Oh my goodness, there is so many here.

1300
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:11,500
OK.

1301
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,500
Oh, we start here.

1302
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:13,040
Alright.

1303
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,660
You guys make it so busy.

1304
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,740
How am I supposed to do this?

1305
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,060
Can we go back to Minecraft?

1306
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:23,600
No.

1307
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,520
You're gonna freak.

1308
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:26,500
I'm gonna freak.

1309
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,380
Let Minto try.

1310
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,380
Let Minto try.

1311
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:33,380
Stop playing.

1312
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:33,700
Stop.

1313
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,100
Get off.

1314
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:34,440
Get off.

1315
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:34,860
Get off.

1316
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:35,720
Get off.

1317
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,080
Get off.

1318
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:36,540
Get off.

1319
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,260
Get off!

1320
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,240
Stop!

1321
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,860
I can't see if you're going.

1322
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:56,740
Stop!

1323
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:58,500
Stop!

1324
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,500
Where do you go from here?

1325
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,480
Oh, like that?

1326
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:08,840
OK.

1327
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:10,000
Oh no!

1328
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,180
I fell off.

1329
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,400
I can't see anything!

1330
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,740
It might not all be wisps.

1331
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,040
I'm telling you...

1332
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,240
I saw, like, one person on...

1333
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:30,040
Well, unless they just decided to leave the...

1334
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:36,000
Or, like, if there are people trying other servers...

1335
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,140
Other universes.

1336
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,280
Cause...

1337
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,200
I saw only one person on earlier.

1338
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,520
Just one.

1339
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:48,380
Nice.

1340
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,340
Did you just go up from here?

1341
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:53,060
OK.

1342
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,500
Where do we go from here?

1343
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:55,600
Oh, over there?

1344
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,600
I can't see.

1345
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,520
I can't see!

1346
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:01,760
OK, nice.

1347
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,900
And then from here, where do we go?

1348
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,860
Everybody is just cra...Oh, over there?

1349
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,500
I was so close.

1350
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,460
There are too many people.

1351
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,340
Too many people!

1352
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,920
Turn off ghost for this part?

1353
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,400
That's such a good idea!

1354
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:25,240
OK.

1355
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:26,660
Options.

1356
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,240
Festival.

1357
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,000
Sorry guys!

1358
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,480
See you later for a second.

1359
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:30,920
OK.

1360
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,620
See you later for a second.

1361
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,340
This is all me.

1362
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:35,700
This is all me.

1363
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:37,480
This is all me.

1364
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,540
This is all me.

1365
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,380
I wonder, can you guys still see me though?

1366
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,080
Oh!

1367
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:44,960
Oh my goodness.

1368
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,180
I fall...

1369
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:49,060
What happened to this pumpkin?

1370
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,440
Kaplooey.

1371
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:54,600
I was like, it got exploded.

1372
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,600
I kind of want to make a boo pumpkin.

1373
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,890
I can't...I don't...I can't...

1374
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:09,170
Freaking stick...

1375
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:11,330
Stay on the dang thing.

1376
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:11,630
OK.

1377
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:14,750
OK, there we go.

1378
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:19,570
I overcompensated.

1379
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:22,990
I want to so badly run like in Minecraft.

1380
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:26,910
But I can't.

1381
01:13:28,490 --> 01:13:29,090
OK.

1382
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:30,470
Parkour.

1383
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:31,970
Parkour.

1384
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:33,790
OK.

1385
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,400
Jump for the beef.

1386
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:48,920
Jump for the beef.

1387
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,560
Always go beef, baby.

1388
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:51,880
Beef, baby.

1389
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,680
All in, baby.

1390
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:55,580
Beef, baby.

1391
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,240
Oh, over here.

1392
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,180
Oh!

1393
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,880
I don't think I jumped soon enough.

1394
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,360
I'm not going to use a mushroom for this.

1395
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,020
Because that's no fun.

1396
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,600
Sorry, I'm really lagging today.

1397
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:15,040
I'm lagging so much today in the brain department, everybody.

1398
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:17,440
Please understand.

1399
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:22,470
Ah!

1400
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:23,670
I was so close.

1401
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:27,630
Brain lag.

1402
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,350
OK.

1403
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:35,380
OK.

1404
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:36,260
OK.

1405
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,000
Oh come on!

1406
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:48,640
I ran into that thing and it pushed me off.

1407
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:53,730
Can't you see your feet?

1408
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:54,490
No.

1409
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:57,010
You can't see your feet.

1410
01:14:57,730 --> 01:15:01,130
So I have no idea what my feet look like.

1411
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,550
Lampy, thanks for the gift!

1412
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,530
Here is Enderpearl.

1413
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:22,640
Oh my God.

1414
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:24,940
We did it, everybody.

1415
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:31,000
Where do I go from here?

1416
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,000
Oh, here?

1417
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,340
We did it!

1418
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,240
Oh wait, there is more.

1419
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:39,760
Just kidding.

1420
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:40,820
Oh wait.

1421
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,000
Oh here, just kidding.

1422
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,720
I was just kidding.

1423
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:48,460
There is more.

1424
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,440
They just give you like a bit of a...

1425
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,400
What's it called?

1426
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,340
A break spot.

1427
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:57,720
Hello?

1428
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,900
Why am I...

1429
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,240
I'm stuck?

1430
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:01,940
There we go.

1431
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,260
I keep overcompensating.

1432
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,240
And then...

1433
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:17,920
Here?

1434
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:19,540
No?

1435
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,700
Where do I...

1436
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,600
Is it this part?

1437
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:28,980
Is it over this one?

1438
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:29,920
Is it this one right here?

1439
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:40,060
I can't figure out what place I'm supposed to jump to.

1440
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,260
Yes?

1441
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:41,600
Ok.

1442
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:41,680
Ok.

1443
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:51,020
And then...

1444
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,300
Oh, that's the top.

1445
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,220
Wait, how do I get there?

1446
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:02,880
What's the correct pathway?

1447
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,520
Oh my gosh, you know how like...

1448
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,540
You know how in like...

1449
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,640
Some people will complain about Resident Evil where...

1450
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,140
It'll be like, they make things too obvious.

1451
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:18,140
Like, why is there a big giant yellow X on the things that I...

1452
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,740
On the places that I need to go.

1453
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:23,260
I feel like that is necessary right now.

1454
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,240
Where it's just like, I need big yellow splotches of paint.

1455
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:31,820
On the areas that I need to jump to.

1456
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:35,720
That's what I need.

1457
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:36,560
Turn around?

1458
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:42,950
Oh, is it this?

1459
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:44,110
Oh my god.

1460
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,360
No freaking way.

1461
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,000
So I need to...

1462
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:09,150
Wait, where do I go from here?

1463
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:14,370
Ok, ok, we didn't lose so much there guys.

1464
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,170
We're fine, we're fine.

1465
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:17,070
We didn't lose so much, we didn't lose so much.

1466
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:18,710
We're ok, we're ok, we're ok.

1467
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:20,190
We're ok.

1468
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:21,410
Everything's fine.

1469
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:24,010
Oh, everything's not fine.

1470
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:26,430
Oh my goodness.

1471
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:32,610
Why am I having to parkour all the time?

1472
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:35,210
And no matter what game I play.

1473
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:37,710
What's so fun about parkour, huh?

1474
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:39,990
Why does everybody love parkour, huh?

1475
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:43,130
What's so fun about parkour, huh?

1476
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,210
Oh my gosh, please.

1477
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:52,910
I'm lagging so bad.

1478
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:56,270
Not in game, but in mind and in spirit.

1479
01:18:57,730 --> 01:19:00,310
I was gonna say body, but...

1480
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:02,030
That's also my spirit.

1481
01:19:11,470 --> 01:19:12,790
That was close.

1482
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:21,850
Oh my god.

1483
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:25,750
Maybe it'd be easier to jump right here.

1484
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,070
Where's the top?

1485
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:51,000
Reserved for who?

1486
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,600
Obi Tower?

1487
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:55,820
No problem.

1488
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,040
Come back my wisps.

1489
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:01,260
Come back.

1490
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:02,820
Not main menu, sorry.

1491
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,120
Oh my gosh, I almost did it again.

1492
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,360
We're back!

1493
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,000
Welcome back.

1494
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,140
Welcome back.

1495
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:14,880
You're so clever.

1496
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:15,660
Thank you.

1497
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:15,700
Thank you.

1498
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,000
Very good everybody.

1499
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:24,480
Very good.

1500
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,560
I wanna see the pumpkins up here.

1501
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,460
Maybe I should have done that before I brought you guys back into the world.

1502
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,140
Check this out.

1503
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,060
IDK who?

1504
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:37,840
It's Rem!

1505
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,040
What do you mean IDK who?

1506
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,640
It's Rem.

1507
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,340
I can also...

1508
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,580
Have a longer bangs.

1509
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,360
I can also have a longer bangs.

1510
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:52,600
Who?

1511
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,140
Shut up.

1512
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,740
Shut up.

1513
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,060
Shrek baby.

1514
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:03,780
Alright.

1515
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,340
Time to do...

1516
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:06,580
Wait.

1517
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:08,520
Time to do...

1518
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,280
The...

1519
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:11,380
Oh my gosh.

1520
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:21,340
Let's go back to the skellies and then we'll do the...

1521
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,260
Haunted house.

1522
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,400
Escape room.

1523
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,060
What the hell is that thing?

1524
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,600
Oh my gosh, I love this Grim Reaper.

1525
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:43,920
It's so cute.

1526
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:46,720
Oh, Pikmin.

1527
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,340
I can't see.

1528
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:50,940
What the hell is this thing?

1529
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:51,420
Cut.

1530
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:51,920
Ok.

1531
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,820
You look cute with longer bangs.

1532
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:08,620
Thanks.

1533
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:17,110
Is that a wolf?

1534
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:20,190
I don't know what that is.

1535
01:22:21,230 --> 01:22:22,810
The hash slinging slasher.

1536
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,520
Thanks Shaggy's wisp.

1537
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,160
I'm starting to get super sleepy, so...

1538
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,480
Let's do the...

1539
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,780
Let's do the... What's it called?

1540
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,760
Oh my gosh.

1541
01:22:58,840 --> 01:22:59,560
Surprise Minto.

1542
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:05,420
Oh cute!

1543
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,160
You guys were nice to each other.

1544
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:10,240
It won't load.

1545
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:14,850
Oh, what the?

1546
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:16,070
No, move, move, move.

1547
01:23:17,810 --> 01:23:19,690
Oh, missing.

1548
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:22,950
Created by missing.

1549
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,280
Spooky.

1550
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:38,320
What?

1551
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:38,960
No!

1552
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:42,460
Hi Minto.

1553
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:42,920
Hi!

1554
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,620
Wait, what the hell just happened?

1555
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:50,000
What do the numbers mean?

1556
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,820
The numbers, what do they mean?

1557
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:01,350
Where did it go?

1558
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:04,590
Where did it go?

1559
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,420
It was never there.

1560
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:17,700
Where is the haunted... Oh, the haunted house is this way, right?

1561
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:22,680
Here we go.

1562
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,060
Oh my gosh, cute!

1563
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:28,520
What?

1564
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,480
You guys, this server is cursed.

1565
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:37,240
It's because it's forbidden.

1566
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:38,480
Maybe.

1567
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,380
Because it's forbidden.

1568
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:43,560
Oh, it's in there.

1569
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:44,200
Is

1570
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,960
it still there?

1571
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:55,890
Missing.

1572
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:58,750
It's kind of creeping me out.

1573
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:01,250
Lantern.

1574
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:03,250
Can you go in there?

1575
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:04,130
Can you fall in there?

1576
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:05,910
To the endless void?

1577
01:25:07,730 --> 01:25:08,610
Ghost made.

1578
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:13,310
Minto!

1579
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:14,810
Thank you.

1580
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:18,750
Server overloaded?

1581
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:19,470
Maybe.

1582
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,590
What the hell?

1583
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:23,250
What is this?

1584
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:26,230
Oh my gosh, Sage plus Anthony.

1585
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:33,790
OK, I'm going to turn you guys off again for just a moment so I can read the rules.

1586
01:25:33,910 --> 01:25:37,330
Because you guys don't know how to listen and you guys don't get out of the way when I tell you to!

1587
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:40,450
So I must get rid of you.

1588
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,220
The evil manor.

1589
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,800
Can you solve the mysteries of the evil manor?

1590
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,240
Before entering, please take note of the following.

1591
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:55,220
Progress is not synced between players.

1592
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,860
Unlocking a door will not unlock it for others.

1593
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,300
Collaboration is encouraged.

1594
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:02,460
It's more fun to solve puzzles with friends.

1595
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:05,560
Jump scares.

1596
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:08,140
Use one of the following codes to enter the manor.

1597
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:10,800
For a family-friendly manor, use 6660.

1598
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,000
For bloody and spooky ambiance, use 6663.

1599
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,660
And for blood and jump scares, use 6666.

1600
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:19,620
You can adjust these later.

1601
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:21,420
Progress is saved when you quit the game.

1602
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,960
Enter if you dare!

1603
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:26,820
We want the blood and the jump scares.

1604
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,140
Hold on, let me enter first and then I'll...

1605
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:36,560
I'll turn you guys back on.

1606
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:42,510
Garfield.

1607
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:45,370
I should have made a Metal Gear one.

1608
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:46,670
Maybe I'll make one after this.

1609
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:50,370
Depending on how long it takes me to do and how I'm feeling after.

1610
01:26:55,630 --> 01:26:56,690
Here we go.

1611
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:58,630
Triangle door.

1612
01:26:58,830 --> 01:26:59,850
This is my first ever.

1613
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:00,690
What's this?

1614
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:02,630
I have one coin.

1615
01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:05,490
If you lose your way, you can trade a coin for guidance.

1616
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:06,490
Oh, no, no, no.

1617
01:27:08,930 --> 01:27:09,570
What's this?

1618
01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:11,110
Lost.

1619
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:12,590
Oh, there's something here.

1620
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:14,370
I found a chest at the manor.

1621
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:19,690
It seems to have the magical property of returning any lost items to me after closing and reopening it.

1622
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:20,490
It's an ender chest.

1623
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:28,290
This will surely come in handy as I delve deeper into the mysteries of this cursed place.

1624
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:30,590
I already found the code to first...

1625
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:32,250
Oh, no.

1626
01:27:32,370 --> 01:27:32,770
See, guys?

1627
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:33,990
I'm starting to get so sleepy.

1628
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:36,430
I already found the code to first safe.

1629
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:40,570
But with a code like that, well, I doubt they really care about security around here.

1630
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:41,370
MB.

1631
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:43,130
What is it?

1632
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:44,610
Like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?

1633
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:47,570
Okay.

1634
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:49,890
I'm with what?

1635
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:52,290
Door is locked.

1636
01:27:56,670 --> 01:27:57,550
Another coin.

1637
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:03,490
I can't see the picture.

1638
01:28:04,230 --> 01:28:05,110
I can't see the picture.

1639
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:06,710
What's the picture?

1640
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:08,210
I can't see the picture.

1641
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:09,790
I can't see the picture.

1642
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:10,530
You!

1643
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:12,510
You with the stupid hat.

1644
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:13,570
I can't see the picture.

1645
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,560
Come on, guys.

1646
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:20,160
Come on.

1647
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:20,580
Seriously.

1648
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:21,300
Come on, guys.

1649
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,100
Come on.

1650
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:45,550
Oh, there's a coin up here.

1651
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:48,510
Nice.

1652
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:50,130
Wait, what was there?

1653
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:58,830
Okay, I'm turning you guys off.

1654
01:28:58,910 --> 01:28:59,570
I'm sorry.

1655
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:03,010
You guys can't stop crowding around, so...

1656
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:04,150
We'll just...

1657
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:05,410
Sorry, everybody.

1658
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:08,510
But now I'm gonna get scared because I'm by myself.

1659
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:09,710
It looks like I'm by myself.

1660
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:12,190
What is it?

1661
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:16,730
It's a silly face.

1662
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:19,590
Okay, so we have...

1663
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:20,210
What's this door?

1664
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:20,890
Is this locked too?

1665
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:21,430
Oh, no.

1666
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:21,530
Oh?

1667
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:31,510
Oh, here.

1668
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:32,590
The key to the safe.

1669
01:29:33,070 --> 01:29:33,250
Okay.

1670
01:29:33,650 --> 01:29:34,350
Or the code.

1671
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:37,230
Probably 1, 2, 3, 4.

1672
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:38,530
I knew it!

1673
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:40,870
Alright, so we got the door...

1674
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:42,850
Or the key to the triangle.

1675
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:43,890
Sorry, no.

1676
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:44,610
Diamond.

1677
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,500
What's that sound?

1678
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:53,940
Okay.

1679
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,900
So we gotta arrange these.

1680
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:58,540
Arrange them, arrange them.

1681
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:02,060
I'm just gonna put them...

1682
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:03,240
Let's do like 3 here.

1683
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,600
4.

1684
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:07,680
Okay, hold on.

1685
01:30:07,780 --> 01:30:08,920
I'm grabbing all of them first.

1686
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:10,680
2.

1687
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:11,980
Okay.

1688
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:14,100
More.

1689
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:15,840
Oh, no.

1690
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:16,620
This one's smeared.

1691
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:19,160
And then 6.

1692
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:20,760
Okay.

1693
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:20,920
Okay.

1694
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:24,380
1.

1695
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:26,440
2.

1696
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:28,440
Oh.

1697
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:29,120
Hello?

1698
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:31,040
2.

1699
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,260
I don't think they're arranged by number.

1700
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,480
I don't think they're arranged by number.

1701
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:40,520
I have a sneaking suspicion.

1702
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,020
Is there any others?

1703
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:43,960
Oh, here it is.

1704
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,060
I found it.

1705
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,460
I got it.

1706
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:51,140
Okay.

1707
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,460
So we just have to figure out...

1708
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:55,720
How to arrange them.

1709
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,480
And then...

1710
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:03,260
We can probably get a code from that.

1711
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:05,380
The moon.

1712
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,780
Nope, like that.

1713
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,480
This connects to this bat, so...

1714
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:13,840
Hold on, I'm gonna move...

1715
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,100
Move things I'm not sure of yet...

1716
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:16,980
Onto the floor.

1717
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,160
Okay, so move this...

1718
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,020
And this...

1719
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:20,760
And this...

1720
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,460
That's not...

1721
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:25,920
That's fine for now.

1722
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:29,100
No?

1723
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:32,240
To this bat?

1724
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:33,720
Oh, nevermind.

1725
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:34,880
Oh, to the cat!

1726
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,800
To the cat!

1727
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:39,980
It goes to the cat.

1728
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:41,200
Okay.

1729
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:44,700
Other cat has a little snot...

1730
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:46,480
A little star connected at the bottom.

1731
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:47,200
So this one.

1732
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:52,470
And then...

1733
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:53,950
Um...

1734
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:55,730
Oh, okay, these go at the bottom.

1735
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:58,090
So I have to move all of this...

1736
01:31:58,090 --> 01:31:58,510
Up one.

1737
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:03,670
Oh, this...

1738
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:04,350
There we go.

1739
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:08,450
And then the other cat...

1740
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:10,490
Can go wherever he feels like.

1741
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:11,430
Because he's just a cat.

1742
01:32:13,650 --> 01:32:14,050
Nevermind.

1743
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:14,970
And then he goes down here.

1744
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:19,790
Wait, something is off.

1745
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:20,530
Oh no!

1746
01:32:20,970 --> 01:32:22,030
I have to shift it all over?

1747
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:24,690
Okay, okay, okay.

1748
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:27,690
Shift, shift, shift.

1749
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:28,990
Shift.

1750
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:34,720
There we go.

1751
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:37,980
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1752
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:44,800
I'm happy I made it onto Minto's stream in some capacity.

1753
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:45,980
Yeah, of course!

1754
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:52,680
48962351.

1755
01:32:58,360 --> 01:32:58,760
Seven.

1756
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,280
The cat is a seven.

1757
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:05,800
489627351.

1758
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,520
What the hell is that noise?

1759
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:17,920
Oh, we didn't even go in here.

1760
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:19,100
There's horse heads?

1761
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:27,280
I'm spooked without you guys all floating around me.

1762
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:36,170
It's not even on the hour.

1763
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:37,230
Why are you going off?

1764
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:40,670
Oh my goodness, there's lots of stuff here.

1765
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:43,670
This place continues to confound.

1766
01:33:43,670 --> 01:33:45,090
It leaves me exhausted.

1767
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:48,390
I dozed off a bit here and fell into a horrible dream.

1768
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:52,070
I saw a monster with four horse heads sewn together.

1769
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:56,830
I can't help but feel this is a bad omen.

1770
01:33:58,330 --> 01:33:59,310
Sewn together.

1771
01:34:00,190 --> 01:34:02,310
Seeing pumpkins and ghosts, I already miss October.

1772
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:03,990
November has pumpkins.

1773
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:05,730
And I'm a ghost, so...

1774
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:06,790
You know?

1775
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:09,010
What is that?

1776
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:11,610
That's weird.

1777
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:11,830
Oh.

1778
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:16,710
Oh, we made it to the first room.

1779
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:17,350
Okay, cool.

1780
01:34:24,650 --> 01:34:25,290
Steak.

1781
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:27,630
Coin.

1782
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:35,460
Okay, so these rotate.

1783
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,820
They weren't horsing around.

1784
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:44,820
What do I get with all these numbers though?

1785
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:46,560
Oh, here.

1786
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:47,580
What was it?

1787
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:48,860
489.

1788
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:53,760
627.

1789
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:58,660
351.

1790
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,080
We did it!

1791
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,200
Good job, team.

1792
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:08,060
This is the triangle.

1793
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:09,100
The actual triangle.

1794
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:10,940
The real triangle.

1795
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:12,240
The realest triangle.

1796
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:14,640
Yay!

1797
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,880
Oh, and there's two coins here.

1798
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:18,440
Is it going to get difficult?

1799
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:19,280
Oh my gosh.

1800
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:20,700
Metal Gear Solid Delta.

1801
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:25,100
Metal Gear Solid Delta.

1802
01:35:37,230 --> 01:35:38,630
It's really quiet in here.

1803
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:40,390
It's kind of relaxing though.

1804
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:43,530
Oh no.

1805
01:35:43,730 --> 01:35:45,190
It's not very relaxing anymore.

1806
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:47,370
Okay, I'm turning you guys back on because I'm scared.

1807
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:57,540
God.

1808
01:36:05,410 --> 01:36:06,070
Okay.

1809
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:08,250
Into the basement.

1810
01:36:11,810 --> 01:36:12,470
Lost!

1811
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:14,690
This is a lost basket.

1812
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:17,010
What else is in here?

1813
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:20,170
What's that sound?

1814
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:23,110
Oh.

1815
01:36:24,830 --> 01:36:26,510
What is this thing?

1816
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:29,510
Okay, maybe we gotta find stuff here.

1817
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:30,610
What the hell?

1818
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:33,390
That he want a cookie.

1819
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,530
He want a cookie.

1820
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:43,450
You can get pictures here?

1821
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:47,730
What is this?

1822
01:36:48,610 --> 01:36:49,310
Apple.

1823
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:56,510
Oh goodness, there's so much stuff around here.

1824
01:36:58,570 --> 01:37:00,710
Okay, the door is locked.

1825
01:37:02,290 --> 01:37:04,470
And then there's another code here.

1826
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:08,780
Okay.

1827
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:21,640
Is there anything that I didn't do yet?

1828
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:27,620
This room?

1829
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:33,770
The horse sewn together.

1830
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:36,850
Saw a monster with four horse heads sewn together.

1831
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:39,390
Yeah, the horses.

1832
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:43,890
I don't feel like I can just brute force it though.

1833
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:45,330
How do I make them sewn together?

1834
01:37:47,450 --> 01:37:48,670
Oh, what's happening?

1835
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:52,070
Oh, I clicked on a person by accident.

1836
01:38:02,730 --> 01:38:03,410
Oh wait.

1837
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:14,460
Is that why this is sewn?

1838
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:15,900
Is that why there's a...

1839
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:18,080
Oh.

1840
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,420
I get it.

1841
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:21,700
S...

1842
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:23,420
E...

1843
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:25,840
W...

1844
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:26,340
N!

1845
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:30,060
Excuse me.

1846
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:31,620
Thank you.

1847
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:32,240
What did I get?

1848
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,540
Where did we see this one?

1849
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:35,720
The little pine.

1850
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:37,040
Oh, you guys can't see it.

1851
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:38,060
It looks like a pine tree.

1852
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,800
Oh, so they gave a hint.

1853
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:42,720
That's so clever.

1854
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,040
Oh.

1855
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,920
I see, I see, I see.

1856
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,820
That was a spooky door.

1857
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:52,960
Was it down here?

1858
01:38:53,620 --> 01:38:54,760
Oh wait, what was this one again?

1859
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:58,080
Nope, not in there.

1860
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:04,870
Not that.

1861
01:39:08,830 --> 01:39:10,010
Where is this?

1862
01:39:12,190 --> 01:39:13,030
Oh, upstairs?

1863
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:17,390
I forgot that there was stuff upstairs.

1864
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:19,970
Oh, here!

1865
01:39:20,170 --> 01:39:20,330
Ok.

1866
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:24,330
Alrighty.

1867
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:26,130
Hello?

1868
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:34,530
Stop it!

1869
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:36,750
Whoa, video game!

1870
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:40,650
Uh oh.

1871
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:41,230
Wait.

1872
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:43,490
Oh gosh, I can't read.

1873
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:47,230
1...

1874
01:39:48,710 --> 01:39:49,190
A...

1875
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:50,310
2...

1876
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:02,790
F...

1877
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:04,870
What is this on here though?

1878
01:40:05,010 --> 01:40:05,570
They are hacking?

1879
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:07,590
They are literally in the matrix right now.

1880
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:08,650
Does this open?

1881
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:09,090
No.

1882
01:40:16,290 --> 01:40:18,030
There is more in here too.

1883
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:19,050
Oh, more coins!

1884
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:20,810
Let's go.

1885
01:40:26,150 --> 01:40:29,630
Why is there just a bust of Cthulhu?

1886
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:32,870
The bust of Cthulhu.

1887
01:40:33,010 --> 01:40:33,970
Go away!

1888
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:39,850
This is...what?

1889
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:44,870
They are learning their ABC's and they are just like 1, 2, 6, 6, 6.

1890
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:47,270
Oh my god, bloody child!

1891
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:49,490
What is this?

1892
01:40:49,630 --> 01:40:51,370
Oh, what is this?

1893
01:40:57,990 --> 01:40:58,350
Tie?

1894
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:09,320
Hall?

1895
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,020
Ok, wait.

1896
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:12,800
So, if I...circle is square.

1897
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:14,700
If square then...ok.

1898
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,500
X is...oh wait, oh gosh.

1899
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:18,800
It's like rock, paper, scissors.

1900
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,320
Yeah, but I don't know the rules.

1901
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:21,700
Ok, hold on.

1902
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:27,280
I was wondering why it was so empty, but I forgot I also turned off other goals to focus on the puzzles, right?

1903
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:30,520
So, if X...ok.

1904
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:32,900
Square is...no.

1905
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:34,800
X is circle.

1906
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,140
Circle is square.

1907
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,620
Circle is square.

1908
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:41,180
Circle is square.

1909
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:44,120
Square is X.

1910
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:47,900
Square is X.

1911
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:49,860
Square is X.

1912
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:51,580
Square is X!

1913
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:53,440
Easy!

1914
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:56,000
Also, I got some scissors too.

1915
01:41:57,540 --> 01:41:58,160
Nice.

1916
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:00,940
Oh, ok.

1917
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:03,780
We can only carry one thing at a time, it seems.

1918
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,500
But, if we need scissors, we got those.

1919
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:07,500
Oh, teardrop.

1920
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:08,180
Here it is.

1921
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,260
Oh my god.

1922
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:13,760
Sorry for disturbing.

1923
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:17,620
Sorry for the intrusion.

1924
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:21,060
It's so fun that everybody can just play these by themselves, you know?

1925
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:27,620
The wall is mysteriously whispering at us.

1926
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:33,780
These...ok, I can't read.

1927
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:34,320
Hold on.

1928
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:37,400
I can't read it.

1929
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:41,420
Ok, there we go.

1930
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:44,160
All these numbers have something in common.

1931
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:45,280
Oh no.

1932
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:47,120
They all equal 10?

1933
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:48,620
Something doesn't add up.

1934
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:49,720
Or does it?

1935
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,340
The squares represent missing digits.

1936
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:56,420
Oh, it's math.

1937
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,040
It's math.

1938
01:42:59,040 --> 01:42:59,580
It's math.

1939
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:02,260
What do all these numbers have in common?

1940
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:06,460
Are they divisible by something?

1941
01:43:12,930 --> 01:43:19,670
And they all equal 10, so it would be 5, 5, 4, 6, 3, 7...

1942
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:22,670
So it would be 5, 6...

1943
01:43:25,670 --> 01:43:29,530
5, 6, 7, 9?

1944
01:43:29,790 --> 01:43:30,050
Oh!

1945
01:43:31,550 --> 01:43:32,230
That worked.

1946
01:43:35,150 --> 01:43:35,790
Ok.

1947
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:38,670
I think I'm a genius after all.

1948
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:43,050
I think I might be a genius after all.

1949
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:45,270
I think I place this object down here.

1950
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:49,210
I'm guessing.

1951
01:43:50,030 --> 01:43:52,230
Let's maybe take the scissors as well.

1952
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:54,090
And do that too.

1953
01:43:58,070 --> 01:43:59,130
Oh my goodness.

1954
01:43:59,350 --> 01:43:59,890
I'm flying.

1955
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:02,170
I'm freaking out.

1956
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:03,190
Ok.

1957
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:06,870
Oh, I found another coin.

1958
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:08,750
I'm the coin genius.

1959
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:09,270
What was that?

1960
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:10,590
What was that sound?

1961
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:14,990
You got the rock and the scissors?

1962
01:44:15,230 --> 01:44:15,670
True!

1963
01:44:16,110 --> 01:44:17,190
Yeah, we got rock, scissors!

1964
01:44:18,450 --> 01:44:19,670
True, true, true.

1965
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:23,210
So what is something that we haven't solved?

1966
01:44:23,370 --> 01:44:24,730
But there are 4 things.

1967
01:44:24,730 --> 01:44:24,830
4 things.

1968
01:44:28,330 --> 01:44:30,730
Oh, here.

1969
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:32,350
I didn't see this because it was surrounded.

1970
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:35,590
The treasure inside guarded by 3 fearsome monsters.

1971
01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:38,570
Defeat them and the prize shall be yours.

1972
01:44:39,630 --> 01:44:43,550
Oh, this is where the prize or the rock, paper, scissors is I think.

1973
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:48,870
But how do I know which one is rock and which one is paper and which one is scissors?

1974
01:44:48,870 --> 01:44:50,250
Or just, you know?

1975
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:54,830
How do I know which one is the rock, paper and the scissor?

1976
01:44:59,910 --> 01:45:01,130
By the shape?

1977
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:03,770
Oh, so you think maybe...

1978
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:05,930
This is scissor.

1979
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:07,630
And this is rock.

1980
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:09,170
And then this would be paper?

1981
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:13,530
Ok.

1982
01:45:15,490 --> 01:45:16,250
Ok, ok.

1983
01:45:18,730 --> 01:45:19,530
Defeat them though.

1984
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:20,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1985
01:45:20,310 --> 01:45:23,410
So what haven't I solved, everybody?

1986
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:27,070
What have I not solved?

1987
01:45:30,310 --> 01:45:31,710
The chess, maybe?

1988
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:33,170
Oh, this one.

1989
01:45:34,210 --> 01:45:35,050
Is it the chess?

1990
01:45:35,370 --> 01:45:36,190
Chess puzzle.

1991
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:41,510
It can't just be 1, 2, 3, 4... wait.

1992
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:46,770
Is it 1...

1993
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:50,290
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

1994
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:52,370
4...

1995
01:45:53,570 --> 01:45:54,130
5...

1996
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:56,290
1, 6, 4, 5...

1997
01:45:59,090 --> 01:45:59,650
7...

1998
01:46:00,290 --> 01:46:00,610
4?

1999
01:46:01,150 --> 01:46:02,110
Look at the computer.

2000
01:46:06,990 --> 01:46:08,490
What's it teaching me?

2001
01:46:10,910 --> 01:46:12,410
What's it teaching me?

2002
01:46:13,550 --> 01:46:16,290
The laptop shows you which pieces how they move.

2003
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:24,480
I don't get it.

2004
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:24,700
Wait.

2005
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,160
I don't get it at all.

2006
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:29,980
This confused me even more.

2007
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,420
Look at the order.

2008
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:38,400
I don't know how chess moves.

2009
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:41,100
I don't know how chess moves.

2010
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:44,140
Wait, I don't know how each piece moves.

2011
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:55,140
So that one is... is that the horse?

2012
01:46:58,020 --> 01:46:59,080
Is that the horse?

2013
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:09,980
Erica,

2014
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:14,000
help me!

2015
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:16,400
I don't know.

2016
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:23,140
I don't know.

2017
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:27,660
Horse is... is eye-shaped?

2018
01:47:32,630 --> 01:47:34,290
Bishop is the funny hat.

2019
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:36,310
Tower is the rook.

2020
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:42,190
This is the queen, that's the king, right?

2021
01:47:42,190 --> 01:47:44,150
And then that's the bishop, that's the pawn.

2022
01:47:45,730 --> 01:47:47,990
The castle is the rook, right?

2023
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:48,430
Wait.

2024
01:47:49,930 --> 01:47:53,050
Guys, I might... I might... I'm gonna go use a coin.

2025
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:03,220
There are a few puzzles in the basement, but you should try opening the safe in front of the white backdrop next.

2026
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:04,500
Wait.

2027
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,480
Safe in front of... is that this one?

2028
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:14,100
Is this considered a white backdrop?

2029
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:15,980
It didn't even help me!

2030
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,500
It didn't even tell me!

2031
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:19,940
I don't know, chess!

2032
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:36,910
No, I think it... you guys, I think it meant there are things in the basement to do, but you should open the...

2033
01:48:37,930 --> 01:48:39,530
Oh, this one!

2034
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:41,290
Oh, this one with the white backdrop.

2035
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:43,850
Cheese!

2036
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:52,050
Cheese!

2037
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:55,430
Cheese!

2038
01:48:56,970 --> 01:48:58,470
Maybe I go into photo mode.

2039
01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:01,270
Selfie cam.

2040
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:04,750
Is there anything back here, actually?

2041
01:49:05,030 --> 01:49:06,090
Oh my god, I look so silly.

2042
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:10,450
I look so silly.

2043
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:13,370
Do I need to... oh my god, he's staring at me too.

2044
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:14,510
Do I need the filter?

2045
01:49:16,010 --> 01:49:18,310
Maybe something that I can only see with the filter on.

2046
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:29,000
This filter?

2047
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,920
Am I thinking too much into it?

2048
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:39,480
Do I take a picture here?

2049
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:42,900
Let's try it.

2050
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:48,840
Oh my god!

2051
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:51,720
6, 6, 4, 8.

2052
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:52,380
Wow!

2053
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:55,980
That looks like Shrek right there.

2054
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,180
That's so cool!

2055
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:03,800
Oh, wait, oh, nope, that's not what I meant.

2056
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:07,260
6, 6, 4, 8.

2057
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:08,060
Yay!

2058
01:50:10,740 --> 01:50:13,400
This one looks like the kanji for in.

2059
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:15,020
Kind of.

2060
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:16,720
Is it this one?

2061
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:17,040
Oh,

2062
01:50:20,140 --> 01:50:20,580
nasty.

2063
01:50:23,780 --> 01:50:24,260
Gross.

2064
01:50:24,260 --> 01:50:24,300
Gross.

2065
01:50:31,650 --> 01:50:36,070
We have to determine the order somehow.

2066
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:40,310
Let's, hold on, before we do that...

2067
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:41,490
Door is locked.

2068
01:50:42,630 --> 01:50:43,390
Spooky!

2069
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:51,770
Maybe it's by size?

2070
01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:59,330
This, this one might go here, right?

2071
01:51:00,110 --> 01:51:01,470
This one here.

2072
01:51:02,110 --> 01:51:03,470
This one here.

2073
01:51:03,470 --> 01:51:04,670
This one here.

2074
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:06,810
Okay.

2075
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:09,810
What's the, huh?

2076
01:51:10,930 --> 01:51:12,250
So we got the first one.

2077
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:21,190
There's like no paper that explains what the other ones will be then.

2078
01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:25,090
Sort by size.

2079
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:28,230
By number of sides.

2080
01:51:28,590 --> 01:51:30,010
Yeah, but then what's the other two?

2081
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:36,120
Okay, so two...

2082
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,640
Oh, wait.

2083
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:39,160
You.

2084
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:47,240
1, 2, 3, 4.

2085
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:54,580
Wait, does this one have more than this one?

2086
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,660
I'm too tired for this.

2087
01:51:58,060 --> 01:51:58,820
I don't think so.

2088
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,340
This one has more, right?

2089
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:05,300
More faces, technically.

2090
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:06,820
Yay!

2091
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:11,600
Okay, so now Roy, G, Biv.

2092
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:13,180
Red.

2093
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:15,540
Orange.

2094
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:17,120
Roy.

2095
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:18,440
G.

2096
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:20,800
Biv.

2097
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:22,140
Yay!

2098
01:52:24,890 --> 01:52:27,120
I don't know what the last one could be though.

2099
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:29,140
What could the last one be?

2100
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:39,140
We did number of sides.

2101
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:42,340
We did...

2102
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:44,060
I did the size.

2103
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:45,040
Reverse size?

2104
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:46,780
Oh, we could try reverse size.

2105
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:47,240
Yeah, maybe.

2106
01:52:54,270 --> 01:52:54,610
No.

2107
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:56,450
Oh, it...

2108
01:52:56,450 --> 01:52:58,490
It counts as size, I think.

2109
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:00,750
As normal size.

2110
01:53:05,310 --> 01:53:05,990
Sides...

2111
01:53:07,110 --> 01:53:07,790
Shapes...

2112
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:10,150
Colors...

2113
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:13,830
Sound?

2114
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,460
How would I even know that?

2115
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:27,320
Huh?

2116
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:31,540
The sound they make when you place them?

2117
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:34,220
How would I...

2118
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:35,380
By pitch?

2119
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:36,700
Low to high?

2120
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:39,080
It's highest.

2121
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:43,420
Never mind, it's the highest.

2122
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:50,250
Wait.

2123
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:10,540
Shows a wavelength?

2124
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:13,100
Oh, it does, you're right.

2125
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:18,660
You're right.

2126
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:23,530
Cool.

2127
01:54:23,710 --> 01:54:24,450
I think I got it.

2128
01:54:27,230 --> 01:54:27,730
No!

2129
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:28,810
Wasn't it?

2130
01:54:28,810 --> 01:54:29,090
Wasn't it?

2131
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:33,560
They...

2132
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:34,460
Are each dice...

2133
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:37,560
The square is a D100, the square is a D6.

2134
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:42,700
But I already did the sides...

2135
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:43,540
Side...

2136
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:44,560
Side...

2137
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:45,600
Sides one.

2138
01:54:51,670 --> 01:54:53,230
I don't think...

2139
01:54:55,110 --> 01:54:57,350
I guess we'll see if doing it in reverse...

2140
01:54:58,210 --> 01:54:58,730
Change it.

2141
01:54:58,910 --> 01:55:00,410
Oh, it did actually change it!

2142
01:55:00,490 --> 01:55:01,470
Oh my gosh.

2143
01:55:02,170 --> 01:55:03,610
Because when I did it...

2144
01:55:03,610 --> 01:55:04,890
In terms of size...

2145
01:55:05,790 --> 01:55:07,090
It was the same thing.

2146
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:09,090
Not this again.

2147
01:55:10,430 --> 01:55:11,670
What's in here?

2148
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:13,690
It's the child.

2149
01:55:14,330 --> 01:55:15,130
What am I...

2150
01:55:15,130 --> 01:55:16,450
What did I just...

2151
01:55:16,450 --> 01:55:19,030
Oh, the coin.

2152
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:25,510
So this is equal to 10?

2153
01:55:28,830 --> 01:55:30,590
4, 2...

2154
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:31,610
0...

2155
01:55:32,330 --> 01:55:32,830
8?

2156
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:38,840
4, 2, 0...

2157
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:41,220
Yeah!

2158
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:44,200
I'm a genius!

2159
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:45,740
I'm a genius!

2160
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:49,760
Where was this room?

2161
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:53,540
Wait...

2162
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:54,760
It's like a little...

2163
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:58,560
Oh, here it is.

2164
01:56:07,540 --> 01:56:10,000
I'm turning the ghost back on!

2165
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:11,840
You guys, come out!

2166
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:13,380
You're my...

2167
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:14,760
You're my...

2168
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:16,900
What's it called?

2169
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:18,980
My...

2170
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:22,900
Like the pets that you bring around that make you feel good.

2171
01:56:23,260 --> 01:56:25,180
Oh, I have to get small for this one.

2172
01:56:39,580 --> 01:56:41,240
3 o'clock?

2173
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:46,300
Emotional support ghost.

2174
01:56:49,940 --> 01:56:52,720
This is so in-depth though.

2175
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:53,620
Isn't it kind of crazy?

2176
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:56,200
No, nothing there.

2177
01:56:58,700 --> 01:56:59,780
Tick-tock.

2178
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:04,300
Anything in here?

2179
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:04,860
No?

2180
01:57:10,810 --> 01:57:12,170
And then there's a maze.

2181
01:57:15,350 --> 01:57:17,940
And then...

2182
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:21,300
There's...

2183
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:22,460
Oh, we can go in here?

2184
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:26,760
What's this?

2185
01:57:31,090 --> 01:57:32,230
Can you go in here?

2186
01:57:33,430 --> 01:57:34,350
Eventually maybe?

2187
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:38,050
Other people are going in and out.

2188
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:39,550
Oh no!

2189
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:45,350
Also, if you try to give me any hints while I'm playing, do not.

2190
01:57:46,150 --> 01:57:49,090
Don't give me any hints, okay?

2191
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:50,250
No hints.

2192
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:51,910
Don't try to show me anything, okay?

2193
01:57:53,510 --> 01:57:56,590
So if you're like, look, you can go through the mirror, don't show me.

2194
01:57:57,030 --> 01:57:58,750
I wanna see it myself.

2195
01:57:59,070 --> 01:58:00,490
How do I make myself smaller though?

2196
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:03,310
Were there any mushrooms about?

2197
01:58:04,950 --> 01:58:06,390
Did you guys see any mushrooms?

2198
01:58:06,390 --> 01:58:06,710
Mushrooms?

2199
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:15,600
Smile out the spoilers.

2200
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:16,560
We can't!

2201
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:18,800
You guys, I still need to figure out this one.

2202
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:21,240
Can you guys just tell me?

2203
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:23,020
You can at least help me with this one, right?

2204
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:25,120
Because I don't know anything about chess.

2205
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:26,740
And I'm tired.

2206
01:58:32,380 --> 01:58:34,120
7, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1.

2207
01:58:34,180 --> 01:58:34,560
Thank you.

2208
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:35,840
Thank you.

2209
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:35,940
You

2210
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:41,740
said no help.

2211
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:42,880
Only with this one.

2212
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:44,740
Because I don't know anything about chess.

2213
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:49,620
It was a genuine cry, you guys.

2214
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:52,820
It wasn't just me being like, help me.

2215
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:55,220
It was a genuine cry.

2216
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:58,160
Oh, is there any mushrooms here?

2217
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:00,600
To make me small.

2218
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:02,780
Maybe not.

2219
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:03,380
Dang it.

2220
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:09,220
After exploring the secret room behind the office, I thought I'd take a moment to rest here.

2221
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:12,700
I've decided to leave my spare notepad here to lighten my pack.

2222
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:14,940
I sure hope no one takes it while I'm gone.

2223
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:16,820
I'll take it.

2224
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:17,600
Oh, paper!

2225
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:19,640
We got the paper.

2226
01:59:23,430 --> 01:59:23,650
Okay.

2227
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:32,920
Okay, so...

2228
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,360
Rock beats scissors.

2229
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:36,700
Oops.

2230
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:39,760
Rock beats scissors.

2231
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:44,480
Paper beats rock.

2232
01:59:44,900 --> 01:59:46,340
Scissors beats paper.

2233
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:46,780
Yay!

2234
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,380
It's an up arrow.

2235
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:53,700
Oh, there's something in here though.

2236
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:57,620
The shed code is 0513.

2237
01:59:58,860 --> 01:59:59,580
0513.

2238
01:59:59,740 --> 02:00:00,680
Remember that, guys.

2239
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:04,100
0513 for the shed.

2240
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:05,960
We haven't gone outside yet.

2241
02:00:06,780 --> 02:00:08,800
This is... where is this one?

2242
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:10,920
Up here, maybe?

2243
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:15,120
No.

2244
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:17,740
In here, maybe?

2245
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:19,960
No.

2246
02:00:24,690 --> 02:00:26,210
Where was this one?

2247
02:00:32,060 --> 02:00:33,120
I can't remember.

2248
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:34,540
They're all blending together.

2249
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:38,720
This one's the stairs?

2250
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:38,860
Stairs?

2251
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:44,020
I never even tried opening that one.

2252
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:46,700
It was next to me?

2253
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:47,560
In the basement?

2254
02:00:56,690 --> 02:00:58,090
Thank you!

2255
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:59,230
I'm so sorry.

2256
02:00:59,890 --> 02:01:00,830
What's happening?

2257
02:01:01,590 --> 02:01:02,610
We're outside!

2258
02:01:03,070 --> 02:01:03,770
Oh my gosh.

2259
02:01:04,530 --> 02:01:05,230
Charlotte.

2260
02:01:08,550 --> 02:01:09,710
Wait, a hole?

2261
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:12,350
Is it negative what?

2262
02:01:14,610 --> 02:01:18,850
From what I know, there should be a clue in the graveyard to give me access to the red safe.

2263
02:01:19,110 --> 02:01:20,490
But I can't seem to figure it out.

2264
02:01:20,730 --> 02:01:22,910
Perhaps I don't have all the information I need yet.

2265
02:01:23,190 --> 02:01:25,630
I should come back later when I've made more progress elsewhere.

2266
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:28,610
Delilah.

2267
02:01:30,510 --> 02:01:30,910
1893.

2268
02:01:31,030 --> 02:01:32,230
This person doesn't get a name.

2269
02:01:33,190 --> 02:01:33,990
Mint Phantom.

2270
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:35,070
Oh no!

2271
02:01:35,470 --> 02:01:35,870
Benjamin!

2272
02:01:38,170 --> 02:01:38,570
Benjamin.

2273
02:01:38,570 --> 02:01:38,830
Benjamin.

2274
02:01:38,970 --> 02:01:40,130
And this one's broken.

2275
02:01:40,470 --> 02:01:41,970
I'm just being dug out.

2276
02:01:42,150 --> 02:01:42,650
Oh my goodness.

2277
02:01:44,170 --> 02:01:45,090
Hey everybody!

2278
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:47,270
We're doing the...

2279
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:49,010
We're doing the...

2280
02:01:49,540 --> 02:01:49,790
The...

2281
02:01:50,490 --> 02:01:50,990
The...

2282
02:01:50,990 --> 02:01:51,890
The room.

2283
02:01:52,990 --> 02:01:53,270
Okay.

2284
02:01:53,850 --> 02:01:56,350
In case you forgot the code to the shed, please check the blue page.

2285
02:01:56,470 --> 02:01:56,950
Oh yeah, yeah.

2286
02:01:57,470 --> 02:01:58,070
So it was what?

2287
02:01:58,130 --> 02:01:59,670
0, 5, 1, 3?

2288
02:02:00,030 --> 02:02:00,330
Yeah.

2289
02:02:04,790 --> 02:02:05,290
Amelia!

2290
02:02:05,590 --> 02:02:06,290
Oh no!

2291
02:02:06,290 --> 02:02:09,350
Oh no, Amelia!

2292
02:02:14,980 --> 02:02:17,260
Was there... There was a safe in here?

2293
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:20,120
So wait...

2294
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:22,420
The first ones were easy and now I'm confused.

2295
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,300
This one looks like the one from...

2296
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:26,700
Enoch!

2297
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:28,720
It is the guy from over the garden wall!

2298
02:02:29,740 --> 02:02:30,740
That's so funny.

2299
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,760
It said there was a...

2300
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:38,420
A red...

2301
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:41,720
Safe.

2302
02:02:44,590 --> 02:02:46,210
What was...

2303
02:02:46,210 --> 02:02:49,070
Oh, the red safe was...

2304
02:02:49,070 --> 02:02:50,210
I think in the bathroom.

2305
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:00,340
But they're all spread out.

2306
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:02,600
Okay, hold on.

2307
02:03:04,460 --> 02:03:05,340
So...

2308
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:07,340
19, 20, blank.

2309
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,520
Or no, 8, yeah.

2310
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:15,160
18, 20, blank.

2311
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:17,040
Please no photos.

2312
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:20,120
20, 90, blank.

2313
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:24,580
1940, blank.

2314
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:36,820
Not this again.

2315
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:46,940
Yeah, I

2316
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:54,260
think the blanks are the numbers we need, but...

2317
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:55,560
So do those numbers...

2318
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:02,480
What do they equal up to?

2319
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:05,000
They can't...

2320
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:07,940
These can't equal up to 10, right?

2321
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:11,280
Unless...

2322
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:13,820
Hold on, how much does this one equal up to?

2323
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:14,340
Let's see.

2324
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:16,800
16.

2325
02:04:18,620 --> 02:04:19,560
Oh, so 20!

2326
02:04:19,820 --> 02:04:21,340
Oh, I think we go up to 20 now.

2327
02:04:21,940 --> 02:04:22,980
Okay, so...

2328
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:26,700
12, 8.

2329
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:28,200
So Delilah is 8.

2330
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:30,800
Um...

2331
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:37,940
And then they're also... It's A, B, C.

2332
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:40,320
Okay, hold on.

2333
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:42,300
I might need you guys to...

2334
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:44,060
I've got it.

2335
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:44,860
Go eat snacks.

2336
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:45,720
Enjoy your snacks!

2337
02:04:47,260 --> 02:04:48,020
Okay, hold on.

2338
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:49,120
So Amelia...

2339
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:50,780
Let's do it in order order.

2340
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:52,600
So this is...

2341
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:54,660
14, uh, 6.

2342
02:04:54,820 --> 02:04:56,780
So 6...

2343
02:05:02,980 --> 02:05:03,860
6, 9...

2344
02:05:10,460 --> 02:05:11,180
Charlotte, 9...

2345
02:05:14,380 --> 02:05:14,740
8?

2346
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:16,040
6, 9, 9, 8?

2347
02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:18,500
Will that be it?

2348
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:21,180
6, 9, 9, 8?

2349
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:22,620
Let's go try.

2350
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:23,780
Where was the...

2351
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:25,780
Where was the...

2352
02:05:27,340 --> 02:05:27,700
Red...

2353
02:05:28,700 --> 02:05:29,420
The red...

2354
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:30,840
Oh, all the doors are shut all of a sudden.

2355
02:05:30,980 --> 02:05:31,280
Why?

2356
02:05:31,460 --> 02:05:32,240
So kind of spooky.

2357
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,120
Is it this one?

2358
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:36,780
Yeah, yeah, okay.

2359
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:38,940
6, 9, 9, 8.

2360
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:39,540
Yay!

2361
02:05:40,420 --> 02:05:41,380
Oh my gosh, guys.

2362
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:42,240
We're a genius!

2363
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:46,740
We're a genius!

2364
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:53,000
3.

2365
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:56,300
Let's go!

2366
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,380
What have we not done?

2367
02:06:05,020 --> 02:06:06,700
What have we not done?

2368
02:06:12,150 --> 02:06:14,550
I think we did everything up in these rooms.

2369
02:06:16,150 --> 02:06:16,530
Yeah.

2370
02:06:16,970 --> 02:06:18,610
I think upstairs is done.

2371
02:06:23,330 --> 02:06:25,310
I think upstairs is done.

2372
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:31,800
And then there's a bunch of...

2373
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:33,880
Oh!

2374
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:34,560
Oh gosh.

2375
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:43,670
This didn't have anything else out here, did it?

2376
02:06:44,410 --> 02:06:46,970
I still have to be able to find a way to get small.

2377
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:52,040
I think.

2378
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:53,300
I don't know what's in there.

2379
02:06:59,740 --> 02:07:01,980
This little guy is here, but then also...

2380
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:03,660
In the shower.

2381
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,120
Okay, there's a lot of stuff in here, I feel like.

2382
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:07,800
Why are you in here?

2383
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:12,480
Like, there's also this thing.

2384
02:07:29,910 --> 02:07:30,310
Soap.

2385
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:35,560
I don't know what's a hint and what's ambiance.

2386
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:39,080
Like, where is even a maze at?

2387
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:39,940
I don't even know.

2388
02:07:42,740 --> 02:07:46,180
Unless this is a thing for the lock.

2389
02:07:46,380 --> 02:07:46,740
Let's see.

2390
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:47,500
Up.

2391
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:49,500
Left.

2392
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:49,860
Up.

2393
02:07:49,940 --> 02:07:50,180
Right.

2394
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:50,740
Let's see.

2395
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:54,920
Stop!

2396
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:55,800
Oh no, wait.

2397
02:07:56,700 --> 02:07:57,160
No!

2398
02:07:57,800 --> 02:07:58,380
Oh my gosh.

2399
02:07:58,580 --> 02:07:59,740
Sorry, I have to turn you guys off.

2400
02:08:04,670 --> 02:08:05,130
Okay.

2401
02:08:05,650 --> 02:08:05,990
Up.

2402
02:08:06,390 --> 02:08:06,810
Left.

2403
02:08:07,010 --> 02:08:07,350
Up.

2404
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:07,810
Right.

2405
02:08:09,690 --> 02:08:10,370
No.

2406
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:18,860
And then this.

2407
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,240
Tick-tock, but...

2408
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:23,140
What do I put here?

2409
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:30,780
This one confuses me.

2410
02:08:32,380 --> 02:08:33,860
Oh, until the exit?

2411
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:35,200
Oh, you think?

2412
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:35,520
Okay.

2413
02:08:35,780 --> 02:08:36,100
Up.

2414
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:37,800
Right.

2415
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:38,600
Up.

2416
02:08:38,820 --> 02:08:39,380
Or up.

2417
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:39,880
Left.

2418
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:40,300
Up.

2419
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:40,800
Right.

2420
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:41,920
Up.

2421
02:08:43,420 --> 02:08:44,100
Up?

2422
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:44,180
Up?

2423
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:46,540
Right?

2424
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:48,420
Up?

2425
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:52,100
I wonder if it's...

2426
02:08:56,540 --> 02:08:59,000
I wonder if it's...

2427
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:04,160
If it counts, like if it wants you to...

2428
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:05,860
I think it means... Yeah, wait.

2429
02:09:06,120 --> 02:09:10,200
I think it wants you to do it at every turn, right?

2430
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:11,520
So, wait, would it be up?

2431
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:12,120
Up then.

2432
02:09:12,120 --> 02:09:12,220
Oh no.

2433
02:09:15,980 --> 02:09:17,180
Just turns?

2434
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:17,880
Okay, okay.

2435
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:18,920
So, up.

2436
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:19,820
Left.

2437
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:20,380
Up.

2438
02:09:20,620 --> 02:09:21,020
Right.

2439
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:21,820
Up.

2440
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:22,540
Right.

2441
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:23,460
Up.

2442
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:24,380
Left.

2443
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:24,800
Up.

2444
02:09:29,090 --> 02:09:30,930
Okay, let's try it.

2445
02:09:33,570 --> 02:09:34,370
Up.

2446
02:09:34,370 --> 02:09:35,170
Left.

2447
02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:36,750
Up.

2448
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:38,550
Right.

2449
02:09:39,150 --> 02:09:39,930
Up.

2450
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:43,960
Wait.

2451
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:44,280
Up.

2452
02:09:44,380 --> 02:09:44,620
Left.

2453
02:09:44,820 --> 02:09:45,080
Up.

2454
02:09:45,260 --> 02:09:45,660
Right.

2455
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:46,280
Up.

2456
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:47,080
Right.

2457
02:09:48,100 --> 02:09:48,540
Up.

2458
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:49,000
Left.

2459
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:49,340
Up.

2460
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:49,940
Ah!

2461
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:50,740
Thank you guys!

2462
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:52,740
Okay, so I had the idea.

2463
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:55,560
Thank you for the little...

2464
02:09:56,720 --> 02:09:58,600
Little... for writing it out for me.

2465
02:09:58,660 --> 02:09:59,080
Thank you.

2466
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:00,820
Yeah!

2467
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:01,800
Yeah, yeah.

2468
02:10:02,740 --> 02:10:03,180
Yippee!

2469
02:10:03,580 --> 02:10:04,020
Yippee!

2470
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:04,480
Yippee!

2471
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:05,900
Oh, I think we can go in now.

2472
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:09,800
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

2473
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:11,640
Oh!

2474
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:12,480
Oh!

2475
02:10:12,940 --> 02:10:13,400
Oh!

2476
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:14,560
Oh!

2477
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:19,120
We can be small now!

2478
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:24,580
Cheese.

2479
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:25,600
Oh my gosh.

2480
02:10:25,700 --> 02:10:26,660
Satanic cheese.

2481
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:29,520
Demon summoning for culinary purposes.

2482
02:10:31,140 --> 02:10:33,620
Lips, butt, ear, nose.

2483
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:34,180
Lips.

2484
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:40,500
Lips, butt, ear, nose.

2485
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:45,420
Nice.

2486
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:51,440
Lips, butt.

2487
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:52,960
Oh, do I have to do it here too?

2488
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:54,680
Huh.

2489
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:56,180
Oh, Mr. Mouth.

2490
02:10:57,220 --> 02:10:57,940
It's kind of freaky.

2491
02:11:00,340 --> 02:11:01,720
Do you think I have to do it again?

2492
02:11:09,170 --> 02:11:12,030
Also, where do I get the lips, butt, ear, mouth?

2493
02:11:13,410 --> 02:11:14,250
Is it mirrored?

2494
02:11:14,350 --> 02:11:15,990
It probably is.

2495
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:18,890
If someone doesn't mind...

2496
02:11:20,010 --> 02:11:22,830
Writing it out again, but mirrored...

2497
02:11:22,830 --> 02:11:26,570
I would really, really appreciate it.

2498
02:11:29,950 --> 02:11:31,370
Original was up.

2499
02:11:31,990 --> 02:11:32,250
Okay.

2500
02:11:35,310 --> 02:11:37,690
Up, left, up, right, up.

2501
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:38,990
Wait, okay.

2502
02:11:40,110 --> 02:11:40,730
Wait, okay.

2503
02:11:41,110 --> 02:11:43,370
Up, right.

2504
02:11:52,670 --> 02:11:53,730
Eat the mushroom.

2505
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:54,570
Oh, that's all it was.

2506
02:11:54,630 --> 02:11:55,850
Oh, but we needed the hand!

2507
02:11:57,430 --> 02:11:59,110
Oh, this is the lips hand!

2508
02:11:59,210 --> 02:11:59,790
Okay, awesome.

2509
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:02,870
Thank you guys.

2510
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:03,790
Thank you.

2511
02:12:04,290 --> 02:12:04,770
Perfect.

2512
02:12:04,770 --> 02:12:06,450
Okay, let's go deliver this.

2513
02:12:07,290 --> 02:12:09,050
To the basement.

2514
02:12:10,450 --> 02:12:13,330
And it was... I don't remember the order.

2515
02:12:13,790 --> 02:12:15,150
So this isn't a three.

2516
02:12:15,330 --> 02:12:16,350
Oh, this is an ear.

2517
02:12:19,150 --> 02:12:19,630
Alright.

2518
02:12:21,550 --> 02:12:22,550
We're all good.

2519
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:27,730
Let's go to the kitchen because the book said for culinary purposes.

2520
02:12:29,710 --> 02:12:33,710
Or maybe... No, we just need to get the hands and put them in the order.

2521
02:12:33,710 --> 02:12:34,790
I think.

2522
02:12:35,210 --> 02:12:36,270
I think we're done in here.

2523
02:12:37,070 --> 02:12:38,150
Yeah, there's nothing else.

2524
02:12:38,210 --> 02:12:40,430
Okay, what else have we... Oh, the TikToks.

2525
02:12:41,250 --> 02:12:42,890
And that door is still locked.

2526
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:53,560
Yeah, we need two more hands.

2527
02:12:57,380 --> 02:12:59,420
I don't understand this one at all.

2528
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:03,280
Like, this part confuses me.

2529
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:10,760
Are there three floors?

2530
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:14,840
I guess technically if you include the basement.

2531
02:13:15,820 --> 02:13:17,380
Is basement this floor?

2532
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:25,020
Sorry.

2533
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:26,760
And then the top floor.

2534
02:13:27,940 --> 02:13:29,800
But this one is a jump scare.

2535
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:30,720
It doesn't do anything.

2536
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:34,080
And so is the same as this door.

2537
02:13:34,980 --> 02:13:36,220
It's a jump scare door.

2538
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:37,240
Oh, there's a coin.

2539
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:40,420
Thank you.

2540
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:46,650
Another coin.

2541
02:13:46,750 --> 02:13:48,570
I'm gonna find all the coins in this place.

2542
02:13:49,770 --> 02:13:51,850
I'm gonna get an achievement for finding all the coins.

2543
02:13:52,390 --> 02:13:52,750
Bless you.

2544
02:13:52,790 --> 02:13:53,350
Thank you.

2545
02:13:56,450 --> 02:13:57,550
Thank you, thank you.

2546
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:03,800
Oh, I see what you mean.

2547
02:14:03,900 --> 02:14:07,000
That there needs to be maybe a clock on...

2548
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,300
Like each floor.

2549
02:14:09,700 --> 02:14:11,840
But it won't let me adjust the clocks.

2550
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:14,280
I can just go to them.

2551
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:18,300
Unless we see what time each one says.

2552
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:19,980
Let's see if we can find one.

2553
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:23,580
Oh, here!

2554
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:30,120
6...610?

2555
02:14:34,550 --> 02:14:35,590
No.

2556
02:14:36,350 --> 02:14:36,630
Wait.

2557
02:14:37,450 --> 02:14:38,170
710?

2558
02:14:40,410 --> 02:14:41,450
711?

2559
02:14:45,090 --> 02:14:46,390
710, 11?

2560
02:14:48,670 --> 02:14:49,010
Okay.

2561
02:14:55,980 --> 02:14:57,140
Oh, that's the light I'm hearing.

2562
02:14:57,260 --> 02:14:58,860
Okay, I thought it was a clock that I was hearing.

2563
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:00,740
Okay.

2564
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,020
Do I add all the times together, I wonder?

2565
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:07,640
This one is...

2566
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:15,980
10...11?

2567
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:19,220
Also, it's the same as the other one.

2568
02:15:19,300 --> 02:15:20,240
Or 1012, maybe?

2569
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:24,180
10PM?

2570
02:15:27,140 --> 02:15:27,980
And then the basement.

2571
02:15:32,330 --> 02:15:35,050
Is this how escape rooms usually are?

2572
02:15:35,170 --> 02:15:36,270
It's pretty fun.

2573
02:15:37,210 --> 02:15:40,050
I don't remember seeing a...

2574
02:15:41,010 --> 02:15:41,610
Oh, here!

2575
02:15:42,650 --> 02:15:44,190
Oh, now it's 9...7!

2576
02:15:47,030 --> 02:15:49,110
So, 7, 10, 7.

2577
02:15:49,110 --> 02:15:50,110
But

2578
02:15:53,780 --> 02:15:56,620
that was 7 on the dot.

2579
02:15:59,700 --> 02:16:02,520
Or unless they want us to put the 19.

2580
02:16:04,160 --> 02:16:05,400
No, no, I think 7?

2581
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:06,500
10?

2582
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:08,920
7!

2583
02:16:21,860 --> 02:16:25,340
What the hell is going on in here?

2584
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:29,480
Oh my god.

2585
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:30,520
Oh, what?

2586
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:31,700
We have to figure out the numbers?

2587
02:16:32,020 --> 02:16:32,580
The numbers?

2588
02:16:32,640 --> 02:16:33,380
What do they mean?

2589
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:40,640
Which one do we...

2590
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:44,580
Paragon, paragon.

2591
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:48,840
So...

2592
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:53,080
5...111...4?

2593
02:16:58,330 --> 02:16:59,610
Did I press it too many times?

2594
02:17:01,690 --> 02:17:02,170
5...111...4?

2595
02:17:02,410 --> 02:17:02,990
No, ok.

2596
02:17:19,310 --> 02:17:19,790
5...

2597
02:17:20,810 --> 02:17:21,690
5, 1.

2598
02:17:21,930 --> 02:17:24,890
Oh wait, how are you supposed to know which one it is?

2599
02:17:27,110 --> 02:17:30,090
How are you supposed to know which one it is?

2600
02:17:30,950 --> 02:17:31,610
Yeah, you're right.

2601
02:17:31,690 --> 02:17:33,850
These ones have... Oh my god.

2602
02:17:33,970 --> 02:17:35,150
These ones have 3 moons.

2603
02:17:35,230 --> 02:17:35,830
I just noticed.

2604
02:17:35,970 --> 02:17:36,510
You're right.

2605
02:17:36,510 --> 02:17:36,650
Ok.

2606
02:17:39,210 --> 02:17:40,390
Oh, this is really big brain.

2607
02:17:40,570 --> 02:17:43,670
Ok, so we have to use the other ones to kind of...

2608
02:17:43,670 --> 02:17:44,850
Get a gauge.

2609
02:17:45,530 --> 02:17:47,110
So which ones are the same?

2610
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:51,230
So I think it's always 5.

2611
02:17:54,890 --> 02:17:57,930
It's 5, 1 I think.

2612
02:18:04,760 --> 02:18:06,180
It's 5, 1.

2613
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:09,840
Or... Yeah, 5, 1.

2614
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:19,660
We can figure this out.

2615
02:18:21,420 --> 02:18:23,140
Yeah, 4 is the last one.

2616
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,820
5, 1...

2617
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:33,860
5, 1, 3?

2618
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,140
5, 1, 3...

2619
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:39,580
Something 4.

2620
02:18:39,720 --> 02:18:40,320
Ok, hold on.

2621
02:18:42,060 --> 02:18:43,960
5, 1, 3...

2622
02:18:52,710 --> 02:18:53,190
2.

2623
02:18:53,510 --> 02:18:54,710
5, 1...

2624
02:18:55,790 --> 02:18:57,710
5, 1, 3...

2625
02:18:59,150 --> 02:19:00,190
2, 4...

2626
02:19:04,910 --> 02:19:06,270
There it is.

2627
02:19:07,930 --> 02:19:10,130
We need to go small I think.

2628
02:19:16,050 --> 02:19:16,350
Oh yeah.

2629
02:19:16,730 --> 02:19:17,510
Oh wait, over here.

2630
02:19:18,390 --> 02:19:19,430
That wasn't so bad everybody.

2631
02:19:23,300 --> 02:19:24,400
What does this say?

2632
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:26,780
There is supposed to be a 4th clock.

2633
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:32,860
But I've searched everywhere, inside the manor, across all the festival grounds, even in alternate universes.

2634
02:19:33,340 --> 02:19:34,400
I just can't find it.

2635
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:34,920
Sigh.

2636
02:19:35,340 --> 02:19:38,380
From everything I've researched, the time on that clock is the key I need.

2637
02:19:38,860 --> 02:19:47,400
Although I might never be able to find that clock, maybe the person reading this will have the power to search places outside of my realm of existence.

2638
02:19:48,180 --> 02:19:49,940
Luckily this keypad seems optional.

2639
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:51,540
I'll pass on this for now.

2640
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,480
Outside of their realm of existence?

2641
02:20:09,060 --> 02:20:11,620
Outside of my realm of existence?

2642
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:14,880
My computer clock you think?

2643
02:20:16,360 --> 02:20:17,500
No way.

2644
02:20:21,460 --> 02:20:23,900
How would they want me to put it in I wonder.

2645
02:20:32,790 --> 02:20:33,390
But...

2646
02:20:33,390 --> 02:20:34,590
The game runs locally.

2647
02:20:34,750 --> 02:20:35,590
True, true, true.

2648
02:20:35,590 --> 02:20:37,830
Oh my gosh, that's so cool.

2649
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:42,410
This is such a fun little...

2650
02:20:43,130 --> 02:20:44,170
Sorry, I forgot.

2651
02:20:44,590 --> 02:20:45,750
I probably should have done this first.

2652
02:20:55,290 --> 02:20:58,090
It's 9.21 for me.

2653
02:20:58,150 --> 02:20:58,810
Oh my god!

2654
02:21:00,570 --> 02:21:01,610
What is this?

2655
02:21:03,290 --> 02:21:04,590
Wait, what is this game?

2656
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:10,020
Oh?

2657
02:21:12,140 --> 02:21:13,140
Web fishing?

2658
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:16,620
I thought it was a short hike.

2659
02:21:16,780 --> 02:21:17,640
It is a short hike?

2660
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,900
Oh, I thought so.

2661
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:28,880
I wonder if this... It says it's optional.

2662
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:30,360
I wonder if...

2663
02:21:31,440 --> 02:21:35,200
I wonder if it was like, you know, back when this was first started.

2664
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:38,420
This pumpkin festival tradition.

2665
02:21:38,420 --> 02:21:43,420
I wonder if this was... A short hike was not out yet and so...

2666
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:46,920
Maybe it was like a preview or something.

2667
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:48,680
No, you can't play it unfortunately.

2668
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:49,780
I'm trying...

2669
02:21:49,780 --> 02:21:52,240
I'm trying the arrow keys too, but it doesn't seem to work.

2670
02:21:52,900 --> 02:21:54,120
Oh, it's not a short hike.

2671
02:21:54,740 --> 02:21:55,060
Are you sure?

2672
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:00,420
It really looks like it, but I don't recognize this character.

2673
02:22:00,660 --> 02:22:01,040
I don't know.

2674
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:07,040
Okay, well, what have I not...

2675
02:22:07,940 --> 02:22:09,100
Gotten yet now?

2676
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:12,720
We're missing...

2677
02:22:12,720 --> 02:22:14,380
We're missing the nose.

2678
02:22:15,580 --> 02:22:16,720
Where is she?

2679
02:22:17,380 --> 02:22:18,560
Where is the nose?

2680
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:20,900
Is there any puzzles I haven't done yet?

2681
02:22:28,540 --> 02:22:29,800
This doesn't open.

2682
02:22:31,380 --> 02:22:33,280
There was a red chest outside?

2683
02:22:33,460 --> 02:22:34,080
There was?

2684
02:22:37,300 --> 02:22:38,440
More in the backyard?

2685
02:22:38,620 --> 02:22:39,100
I'll go check.

2686
02:22:40,140 --> 02:22:41,260
Let's go check.

2687
02:22:45,610 --> 02:22:46,570
The office.

2688
02:22:47,210 --> 02:22:48,250
What's the office?

2689
02:22:48,410 --> 02:22:50,110
We went in here too, right?

2690
02:22:50,170 --> 02:22:51,170
There was nothing else in here?

2691
02:22:51,590 --> 02:22:51,930
Yeah.

2692
02:22:53,390 --> 02:22:54,290
We did everything?

2693
02:22:56,790 --> 02:22:58,230
We did everything in here.

2694
02:22:59,010 --> 02:22:59,890
Where's the office?

2695
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:16,180
Yeah, he did mention an office upstairs.

2696
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:17,780
Oh yeah, thank you.

2697
02:23:17,980 --> 02:23:18,760
It was this one, right?

2698
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:24,940
This?

2699
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:30,240
Oh wait, what did I just click?

2700
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:31,920
Oh, coin.

2701
02:23:38,540 --> 02:23:40,920
The digits always add up to the same thing.

2702
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:43,520
I didn't even realize the bonus hint.

2703
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:46,520
We didn't need it, we're too smart.

2704
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:50,780
Office is upstairs.

2705
02:23:50,780 --> 02:23:52,400
Yeah, it's the office, right?

2706
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:53,480
It seems office-y.

2707
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:56,780
What was the...

2708
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:00,500
No, that said that though, I don't remember.

2709
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:03,480
I don't remember.

2710
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:07,380
Did it say something about a painting in here?

2711
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:09,080
Look closer.

2712
02:24:12,980 --> 02:24:14,000
Oh, the secret room!

2713
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:17,680
That's right.

2714
02:24:30,820 --> 02:24:32,220
It's a horse girl.

2715
02:24:52,460 --> 02:24:53,060
Horse.

2716
02:24:56,800 --> 02:24:57,400
Horse.

2717
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:01,840
Wait, there was a creepy little plushie.

2718
02:25:03,420 --> 02:25:05,740
There was a creepy little plushie here.

2719
02:25:06,040 --> 02:25:06,980
Did you guys see it?

2720
02:25:07,580 --> 02:25:12,060
Does it move when I...

2721
02:25:12,060 --> 02:25:14,140
Oh my god, quantum horse.

2722
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:16,520
Quantum horse!

2723
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:17,360
Quantum horse!

2724
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:18,140
Quantum horse!

2725
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:21,040
Oh my god.

2726
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:22,940
Quantum horse!

2727
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:23,740
Quantum horse!

2728
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:28,000
Okay, actually I need to turn off the ghosties for this.

2729
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:29,200
I'm sorry guys, sorry!

2730
02:25:29,620 --> 02:25:30,640
Hi and goodbye!

2731
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:32,420
Hi and goodbye.

2732
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:36,160
And four...

2733
02:25:37,380 --> 02:25:38,060
Six...

2734
02:25:43,080 --> 02:25:43,760
Eight...

2735
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:45,240
Four...

2736
02:25:50,350 --> 02:25:51,030
Eight...

2737
02:25:51,030 --> 02:25:51,530
Six!

2738
02:25:52,490 --> 02:25:53,650
Wait, what was it?

2739
02:25:53,730 --> 02:25:55,310
Four, six...

2740
02:25:55,310 --> 02:26:01,070
Quantum horse.

2741
02:26:03,710 --> 02:26:05,090
That's so creepy.

2742
02:26:07,030 --> 02:26:08,690
Quantum... Oh my god!

2743
02:26:09,190 --> 02:26:09,690
Horses!

2744
02:26:09,850 --> 02:26:10,190
Horses!

2745
02:26:10,270 --> 02:26:10,750
Horses!

2746
02:26:10,870 --> 02:26:11,330
Horses!

2747
02:26:11,470 --> 02:26:12,070
Horses!

2748
02:26:14,350 --> 02:26:16,950
The... Wait, tale of the horse.

2749
02:26:16,950 --> 02:26:17,190
Horse.

2750
02:26:19,630 --> 02:26:21,570
I love this quantum room.

2751
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:27,020
Oh, it's an upside-down horse.

2752
02:26:27,460 --> 02:26:28,840
There's so many horse... Oh my god.

2753
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:30,700
Everything is on this side of the room now.

2754
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:32,880
There's so many horses.

2755
02:26:33,080 --> 02:26:33,580
Okay, let's leave.

2756
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:35,920
We got it!

2757
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:39,600
What is it about this game?

2758
02:26:39,660 --> 02:26:41,180
I think it's me being so...

2759
02:26:42,060 --> 02:26:43,560
Susceptible because I'm tired.

2760
02:26:43,820 --> 02:26:47,760
It's like everytime I jump my stomach actually drops like I'm on a rollercoaster.

2761
02:26:57,440 --> 02:26:58,080
Wait.

2762
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:02,180
Emotional support.

2763
02:27:14,480 --> 02:27:16,740
Just in case there's any jump scares.

2764
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:16,900
Jump scares.

2765
02:27:24,420 --> 02:27:26,020
Wow, this is a long hallway.

2766
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:26,540
Hello!

2767
02:27:27,560 --> 02:27:28,100
Hi!

2768
02:27:28,620 --> 02:27:29,560
Everybody is here.

2769
02:27:29,740 --> 02:27:31,760
Thanks for making way for me.

2770
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:37,380
Red means scary.

2771
02:27:53,070 --> 02:27:57,630
That sure was a pretty haunted house.

2772
02:27:58,810 --> 02:27:59,330
You did it.

2773
02:27:59,370 --> 02:28:00,630
You solved Scoundrel.

2774
02:28:00,830 --> 02:28:01,590
Happy Halloween.

2775
02:28:02,270 --> 02:28:03,930
Click to teleport back to lobby.

2776
02:28:11,010 --> 02:28:13,750
I'm not alive, but that was great.

2777
02:28:15,250 --> 02:28:16,870
That was so fun.

2778
02:28:18,750 --> 02:28:20,530
That was so fun.

2779
02:28:24,390 --> 02:28:25,730
I love this guy.

2780
02:28:30,190 --> 02:28:31,390
Can I get a water?

2781
02:28:32,310 --> 02:28:33,430
Alright, teleport.

2782
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:46,780
That was so much fun.

2783
02:28:47,820 --> 02:28:49,940
This was such a fun little thing.

2784
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:53,600
I know I wish I had known about it before Halloween.

2785
02:28:54,260 --> 02:28:56,520
So that we could have done it during spooky month.

2786
02:28:56,820 --> 02:28:58,980
But, you know, it's so...

2787
02:28:58,980 --> 02:29:00,380
This one is so cool, right?

2788
02:29:00,480 --> 02:29:01,340
This one is crazy.

2789
02:29:02,460 --> 02:29:03,420
It's still...

2790
02:29:05,260 --> 02:29:08,340
At least fall, so...

2791
02:29:09,780 --> 02:29:13,560
Yeah, we were able to do it at least during the fall time, you know?

2792
02:29:21,890 --> 02:29:23,530
How high can you go?

2793
02:29:25,090 --> 02:29:26,390
How high can I go?

2794
02:29:27,050 --> 02:29:28,530
Oh my god, they look like...

2795
02:29:28,530 --> 02:29:31,270
They look like little bubbles floating everywhere.

2796
02:29:34,430 --> 02:29:35,930
This was so cute though.

2797
02:29:37,370 --> 02:29:39,550
Next year I will do it again.

2798
02:29:40,170 --> 02:29:42,510
If they add new stuff, you know?

2799
02:29:42,850 --> 02:29:46,810
But for sure, if I can remember, I will at least add a pumpkin.

2800
02:29:47,270 --> 02:29:51,350
And I'll tell you which area the pumpkin is in.

2801
02:29:51,490 --> 02:29:53,110
So you can go try and find it.

2802
02:29:56,290 --> 02:29:58,790
But this was so much fun.

2803
02:29:58,890 --> 02:29:59,830
Thank you guys.

2804
02:30:02,010 --> 02:30:05,630
Sorry for being a little low energy since I'm so sleepy.

2805
02:30:06,370 --> 02:30:07,430
But I had fun.

2806
02:30:07,550 --> 02:30:09,210
Hold on, I wanna go on this again.

2807
02:30:10,290 --> 02:30:12,430
We can just kind of park ourselves right there.

2808
02:30:18,580 --> 02:30:19,540
I stretch.

2809
02:30:27,860 --> 02:30:29,260
Sleep time for me.

2810
02:30:31,140 --> 02:30:32,720
Sleep time for me.

2811
02:30:32,900 --> 02:30:33,760
Sleep time for me.

2812
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:36,300
Thank you guys, everybody who also joined in.

2813
02:30:36,380 --> 02:30:38,220
Thank you all the little ghosties.

2814
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:39,380
Thank you, thank you.

2815
02:30:40,060 --> 02:30:44,040
Oh my god, I forgot that they screamed in this.

2816
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:51,160
I was really excited about this one because I knew that so many people could join in.

2817
02:30:51,740 --> 02:30:52,640
And it's also free.

2818
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:58,940
So, you know, I saw that some people were sad with the web phishing.

2819
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:07,860
That I made the code for just members to be able to join even though it was a public stream.

2820
02:31:08,580 --> 02:31:11,640
And honestly, the only reason I did that was because...

2821
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:15,640
Was because the game...

2822
02:31:15,640 --> 02:31:16,600
Oops.

2823
02:31:19,780 --> 02:31:23,780
Was because the game was so easily able to be hacked.

2824
02:31:24,460 --> 02:31:30,060
That's the only reason I made it so that it wasn't a quote-unquote public code.

2825
02:31:30,220 --> 02:31:34,040
But I'm really sorry if that made people feel like, you know...

2826
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:37,800
I don't want anyone ever to feel like that I don't appreciate them.

2827
02:31:37,980 --> 02:31:45,200
Even if they can or can't afford to pay for membership or anything like that.

2828
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:46,820
So, I'm really sorry.

2829
02:31:49,300 --> 02:31:49,820
And...

2830
02:31:51,220 --> 02:31:54,980
So at least with this, we could have lots and lots of people join.

2831
02:31:55,540 --> 02:31:57,160
So, goodbye fellow ghost.

2832
02:31:57,300 --> 02:31:58,440
Goodbye fellow ghost!

2833
02:32:00,260 --> 02:32:01,080
Wait, hold on.

2834
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:02,360
I want to be big.

2835
02:32:03,580 --> 02:32:04,680
Back to being big.

2836
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,040
Got to find it.

2837
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,900
Since, you know, I really do appreciate everybody...

2838
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:13,120
Even just, you know...

2839
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:16,520
Anybody just watching me is very much...

2840
02:32:16,520 --> 02:32:18,380
Always appreciated, so...

2841
02:32:18,380 --> 02:32:20,800
At least with this, so many people could join.

2842
02:32:21,020 --> 02:32:23,000
And it's a free game, so...

2843
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:26,220
Yeah, and it's safe because there's not like a chat or anything.

2844
02:32:26,980 --> 02:32:29,320
It's like, they're just the free...

2845
02:32:29,320 --> 02:32:31,400
Where is the dang mushroom?

2846
02:32:34,300 --> 02:32:38,200
There's just the free, the little chat that they have in here instead.

2847
02:32:38,440 --> 02:32:38,920
Oh, here it is.

2848
02:32:43,180 --> 02:32:44,200
So yeah.

2849
02:32:44,620 --> 02:32:45,920
Thank you guys!

2850
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,820
I'm gonna go camera mode.

2851
02:32:49,820 --> 02:32:50,400
Selfie.

2852
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:51,580
Get in guys!

2853
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:52,020
Get in!

2854
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:52,960
Get in behind me!

2855
02:32:53,060 --> 02:32:54,080
Get in behind me!

2856
02:32:54,440 --> 02:32:55,760
Get in behind me!

2857
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:58,080
Behind me!

2858
02:32:58,240 --> 02:32:59,040
Behind me!

2859
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:00,900
Stop getting so close!

2860
02:33:01,020 --> 02:33:01,880
Behind me!

2861
02:33:04,040 --> 02:33:05,300
Behind me!

2862
02:33:07,880 --> 02:33:10,420
Stop showing your camera in my face!

2863
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:12,320
Get behind me!

2864
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:12,940
Oh my god.

2865
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:14,620
You guys don't listen well.

2866
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:15,520
Come on.

2867
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:16,420
There we go.

2868
02:33:16,960 --> 02:33:17,580
There we go.

2869
02:33:18,160 --> 02:33:19,580
Goodbye fellow ghost.

2870
02:33:19,900 --> 02:33:20,780
I'm gonna freak!

2871
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:23,840
Alright, everybody on the count of three...

2872
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:25,160
Say, I'm gonna freak!

2873
02:33:26,580 --> 02:33:27,740
Wait, where is it?

2874
02:33:28,780 --> 02:33:29,420
One!

2875
02:33:29,860 --> 02:33:30,200
Two!

2876
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:31,280
Three!

2877
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:33,400
I'm gonna freak!

2878
02:33:33,400 --> 02:33:34,420
Freak!

2879
02:33:40,910 --> 02:33:42,670
Thank you guys!

2880
02:33:43,130 --> 02:33:43,930
Otsuminto!

2881
02:33:44,530 --> 02:33:47,190
See you guys tomorrow or whenever I see you next.

2882
02:33:47,610 --> 02:33:48,370
Bye bye!

2883
02:33:48,750 --> 02:33:49,390
Bye bye!

2884
02:33:49,470 --> 02:33:49,930
Bye bye!

2885
02:33:50,150 --> 02:33:50,910
Thank you!

2886
02:33:51,070 --> 02:33:51,790
Thank you!

2887
02:33:52,190 --> 02:33:53,110
Good night!
