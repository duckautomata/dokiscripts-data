1
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,500
I am Astro Bot.

2
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,860
Astro Bot.

3
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,040
I am Astro Bot.

4
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,980
I hit every single can!

5
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,380
Don't fall off, little bots!

6
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,630
Astro Bot.

7
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,910
Can you guys hear it, by the way?

8
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,370
Can you hear it?

9
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,410
Can you hear the audio?

10
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,690
Can you hear me?

11
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,930
Ping-pong-ping.

12
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,390
Yeah?

13
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:00,890
Again?

14
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,810
Okay, good.

15
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,690
Welcome back, Master!

16
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:04,890
Master!

17
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,240
Welcome back to...

18
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,720
Welcome back to Astro Bot!

19
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,580
Oh my gosh.

20
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,580
Cinderoth!

21
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,800
Cinderoth, a little thank you!

22
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,620
Oh, you guys can't hear it.

23
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,180
Thank you so much for the Akadono!

24
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,720
Happy...

25
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:25,700
Happy...

26
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,920
Astro Bot.

27
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,910
I'm holding it like a kid would hold an actual plane.

28
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:41,750
You know?

29
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,070
Like a...

30
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,310
I'm not holding it like a controller.

31
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,210
I'm like...

32
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,550
I'm like...

33
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:52,810
Oh yeah.

34
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,330
The game is a tiny bit louder than me.

35
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,370
Am I quiet?

36
00:03:59,590 --> 00:03:59,890
Maybe.

37
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,810
Happy Friday, everybody!

38
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,570
I'm gonna press a button.

39
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,970
Our save data.

40
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,770
I've been listening to this song for quite a minute, so I kinda wanna...

41
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:19,610
You!

42
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,290
You!

43
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,850
Welcome back!

44
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,390
Welcome back!

45
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,150
Lampy!

46
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,810
Thanks for the gift!

47
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,170
Did it just say Minto Bot?

48
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,930
This game is personalized to me.

49
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,910
Fri-yay!

50
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,490
Happy Fri-yay, everybody!

51
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,170
I hope...

52
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,070
I hope that you are all doing well!

53
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,190
And if you're not doing well, that's okay too.

54
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,850
I hope that you...

55
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,410
Um...

56
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,690
I hope that maybe the stream can cheer you up a little bit.

57
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,110
Or we can just kind of chill with some fun astro buddies.

58
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,930
And, uh...

59
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,790
Yeah!

60
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,350
Hi!

61
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,330
Hi!

62
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,810
Entry goes next to the 20 gifted!

63
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,630
Thank you!

64
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,010
Certain announcement has me feeling down.

65
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,710
I know.

66
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,670
I know.

67
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,350
I, uh...

68
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,630
I don't wanna talk so much about it.

69
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,930
It's not really my place to.

70
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,850
Um...

71
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,810
But, uh...

72
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,290
You know...

73
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,410
Um...

74
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,470
I think...

75
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,250
Uh...

76
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:36,890
I think...

77
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,750
If...

78
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,110
Someone is Hiroshi...

79
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,190
And...

80
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,950
They...

81
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,750
Make a big announcement...

82
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,150
That maybe is more of a negative thing...

83
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,830
I think you should trust in Hiroshi.

84
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:53,930
And...

85
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,630
Them doing what is best for them.

86
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,250
And...

87
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,450
Um...

88
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,450
You know...

89
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,670
Trust that...

90
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,890
Whatever decision that they've made...

91
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,910
Is...

92
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,270
You know...

93
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,430
Like I said, best for them.

94
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,550
And...

95
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,370
Um...

96
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,630
You know...

97
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,870
Despite how hard, how difficult it might be.

98
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,110
Um...

99
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,290
But...

100
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,470
Um...

101
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:18,810
Yeah.

102
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,050
Uh...

103
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,050
Like I said, it's not really my place...

104
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,070
To...

105
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,750
Comment on it.

106
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:25,530
I...

107
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,090
Um...

108
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:27,570
But...

109
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,990
Definitely will be a big...

110
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,270
Hole...

111
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,450
Left.

112
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,370
I think.

113
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,290
Um...

114
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,950
Yeah...

115
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,290
Yeah...

116
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,670
But, like I said...

117
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,990
Let's, uh...

118
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,850
Let's just have a fun time.

119
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,690
Chill time.

120
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,830
And...

121
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,310
Be excited for the weekend.

122
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,190
And...

123
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,690
Excited that...

124
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,590
This weekend...

125
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,390
Becomes fall.

126
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,090
And...

127
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,350
With fall...

128
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,090
Comes...

129
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,890
Halloween.

130
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,290
And...

131
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,150
With fall...

132
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,670
Comes...

133
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,610
Nice weather.

134
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,710
And...

135
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,610
With fall...

136
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,850
At least in the Northern Hemisphere.

137
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,510
Sorry if you're in the Southern Hemisphere.

138
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,030
And it comes...

139
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,910
Uh...

140
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,230
And...

141
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,430
And also...

142
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,930
Um...

143
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,690
Uh...

144
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,070
Pumpkin Pie!

145
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:12,970
And...

146
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,490
Yippee!

147
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,830
It's spring here.

148
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,410
Well, when spring comes...

149
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,270
April showers...

150
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,570
And they...

151
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:20,830
Uh...

152
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,290
Wait...

153
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,350
That doesn't really work.

154
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,030
Uh...

155
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,490
Uh...

156
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,970
October showers bring November flowers.

157
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,470
Yeah!

158
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,050
Yay!

159
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:34,830
Pumpkin Pie!

160
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,690
Oh my god!

161
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,810
Mariah Carey is defrosting.

162
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,670
She's defrosting.

163
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,110
But...

164
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,130
She...

165
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,930
Is...

166
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:43,490
Not...

167
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:43,830
Frozen.

168
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,390
Free...

169
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,150
Yet...

170
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,710
We have Halloween to get through.

171
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,950
Been a bit of a rough year, but I'm...

172
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,810
Not here for that.

173
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,210
I'm here for Metal GearBots.

174
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:51,970
Yeah!

175
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,210
That sounds wrong.

176
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,010
Well...

177
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,750
I mean...

178
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,970
Typically, April showers brings the May flowers.

179
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,510
Do they say that because of the May flower?

180
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,910
Christopher Columbus?

181
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,410
And with fall comes the 10th anniversary of War for the Garden...

182
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:13,610
Whoa!

183
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:13,810
Oh!

184
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,410
Oh my gosh!

185
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,170
Did you guys see?

186
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,070
That...

187
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,050
They almost tried to take over the garden wall off of Hulu.

188
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,410
And then even...

189
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,230
Even the creator of...

190
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,370
The creator of Gravity Falls is like, what the F are you guys doing?

191
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,910
Apparently, they...

192
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,850
Apparently, it's not getting taken off now, which is...

193
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,590
I don't know.

194
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,710
I only saw one tweet that someone said it's not leaving now.

195
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,170
Oh, Mayflower is the pilgrim.

196
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:42,630
So...

197
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,350
Why are you guys still watching?

198
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,530
What is that?

199
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,210
I've been dead for a while.

200
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,050
I don't really care about human history, okay?

201
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,390
It's literally saying rain helps grow flowers.

202
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,430
Yeah!

203
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,930
But there's also...

204
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,150
The Mayflower!

205
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,970
Which what even is that?

206
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:15,730
Oh!

207
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:27,850
But yeah, so... I guess Hulu is not getting rid of Over the Garden Wall, which means we can watch it!

208
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:28,610
Yippee!

209
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,110
Yippee yippee yippee!

210
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,390
Over the Garden Wall is safe as of today.

211
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:35,850
Yeah.

212
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,030
Hopefully.

213
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,750
Why would you take it down anyway?

214
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,050
Great show.

215
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,950
Isadora, welcome to Memboshoop!

216
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,530
Sobri, thanks for 30 months!

217
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,570
And Raylord, welcome to Memboshoop!

218
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,050
Thank you!

219
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,050
Cool!

220
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:57,310
So... I guess there's not really a story in this for it to be like, last time we did this, but...

221
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,490
I'm so excited for Minto Bot Friday.

222
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,130
Minto...

223
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,570
...Bot Friday?

224
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,570
Did you guys see that Earth is temporarily gonna get a second moon?

225
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,950
I think it's only for like, one day.

226
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,670
Kinda crazy.

227
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,850
What's going on?

228
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,070
What if this... Does that mean the moon will be in...

229
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,630
Renegade?

230
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,130
Uh...

231
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,390
Gatorade?

232
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,270
Happens every now and then.

233
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,530
That's crazy.

234
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,890
Why can't it stay?

235
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,890
I want a second moon!

236
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,290
That's so, like...

237
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,270
That's so...

238
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,510
Fan... Not fantasy novel.

239
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,830
Like, dystopian novel.

240
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,950
That's so... Young adult dystopian novel.

241
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,110
Yeah, very sci-fi.

242
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:55,910
I want it to stay!

243
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:56,790
I want it to stay!

244
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,650
I wonder how that would affect... the tides.

245
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,290
Moon NTR?

246
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,010
Nooo...

247
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,510
Moonfall?

248
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,990
Yeah, we need more moons.

249
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,610
More moons, more moons, more moons.

250
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,730
That would be awesome.

251
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,870
Blow up the moon and make two moons!

252
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,790
No, I think, you know...

253
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,550
We could just start collecting moons.

254
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,110
Eventually, we won't even see the sun.

255
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,110
We'll have so many moons.

256
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,510
Around, uh... around, uh... planet Earth.

257
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,610
I do love a good full moon.

258
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,170
Yeah, but what if you had two full moons?

259
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,290
Oh, yeah!

260
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,190
Both double-cheeked up!

261
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,030
What's better than one moon?

262
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,050
Two full moons!

263
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,870
On a Friday afternoon?

264
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,070
On a Friday evening, even.

265
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,070
I must trauma-dump.

266
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,190
What is this?

267
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,250
I was making chili lime chicken and I ran out of...

268
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,270
Chug water chili powder.

269
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,150
What's chug water?

270
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,390
What's so special about that?

271
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,110
So I went to the store to buy some more...

272
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,230
And they're charging $11!

273
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,210
I cried, but my chicken is now cooking.

274
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:28,750
Oh!

275
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,830
Sorry, ducky, I missed yours.

276
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,990
Time to start your own history with the minto flower.

277
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,150
What is a chug water chili powder?

278
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,070
Is that just a brand?

279
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:40,550
DJ!

280
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,690
Thanks for the popcorn!

281
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,470
I saw a clip of Astrobot where Kinryu Kazuma was featured.

282
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,970
Perfect timing with the latest Ryuga Gotoku game announcement.

283
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,650
The pirate one, right?

284
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,730
Oh my gosh, I gotta get my butt in gear and play Yakuza.

285
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,290
I gotta play Yakuza.

286
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,890
I gotta play Devil May Cry.

287
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,090
I was thinking after...

288
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:04,910
Maybe...

289
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,810
After Eternal Darkness...

290
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,390
Once I'm back home, maybe I'll do...

291
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,550
I'll start the DMC.

292
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:17,890
Maybe, maybe.

293
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,330
We get a temporary new moon and a temporary new star this month.

294
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,830
What?

295
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,050
I didn't hear about the star.

296
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,510
No way.

297
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,590
Yakuza sold your game.

298
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:36,510
But I thought maybe doing Devil May Cry because it would be shorter.

299
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,510
I think I have to...

300
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:38,790
I have to...

301
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,750
I have to start Yakuza once I'm done, done with the Metal Gear series.

302
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,350
You know what I mean?

303
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,710
Because I really want to dedicate time to it.

304
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,490
Yeah, it's much shorter.

305
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,330
So...

306
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,890
That's kind of where my brain is at.

307
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,490
Yakuza is now...

308
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,390
Wait.

309
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,390
Was it like yesterday?

310
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,070
International pirate...

311
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,050
Talk like a pirate day?

312
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,690
I wonder...

313
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,930
That's why they announced it.

314
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:10,610
Yakuza.

315
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,390
Okay.

316
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,070
All right.

317
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,030
I'm done talking.

318
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,650
Let's go visit our bots real quick.

319
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,850
Let's go visit our bots real quick and see how they're doing.

320
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,510
Oh my gosh.

321
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,890
Crash jump scare.

322
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,790
Oh, the way they salute is so cute.

323
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,930
So these are all our bots so far.

324
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:35,490
Oh my gosh.

325
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,090
This guy is doing...

326
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,450
What the gay?

327
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:38,970
Well...

328
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,010
Not really.

329
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,410
Well...

330
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,350
Oh my gosh.

331
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,310
This Waza is so advanced.

332
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,330
No.

333
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,310
No.

334
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,130
No.

335
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,430
No.

336
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,050
No.

337
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,250
No.

338
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,910
Ma.

339
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,050
Su.

340
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,990
He's doing his best.

341
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,690
He's still learning.

342
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,990
Yeah.

343
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,110
He's still learning.

344
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,750
Airplane directing?

345
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,330
No.

346
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:03,910
No.

347
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,170
No.

348
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,790
No.

349
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:06,810
No.

350
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,670
Hi snake.

351
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,230
Hi snake.

352
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,890
Hi Oh my gosh.

353
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:16,510
When I get close to him I just realized my controller actually started rumbling.

354
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,410
Chug water is a place in Wyoming.

355
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,410
It's a very small podunk town.

356
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,730
There's about 175 people in it.

357
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,150
You guys.

358
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,610
I think we need to go to chug water and take it over.

359
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,790
Can we take over a chug water?

360
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,770
Chug Water, Wyoming.

361
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,170
I think we can have a revolution there.

362
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,130
They make the best chili and their chili powder is great for chicken.

363
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,570
Let's go take over Chug Water!

364
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,490
I have to remember the controls.

365
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,630
What was circle?

366
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,010
Okay, so we have to jump obviously.

367
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,110
Oh yes, hold it.

368
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,590
Nikki,

369
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,750
I hope I said your name right.

370
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,610
Thanks for the podcasting!

371
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,750
It's bite time.

372
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,050
Oh sorry, Snake.

373
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,010
I'm beating him up.

374
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,070
Snake, don't forget your magazine.

375
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,310
What is he doing in there?

376
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,850
This is not the love box.

377
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,510
This is not the love box.

378
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,670
And we got some... we had the gacha.

379
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,570
We opened this up.

380
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,990
Right?

381
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,610
I don't think I have any more though.

382
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:46,570
Gachala!

383
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,670
Oh wait!

384
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,150
It's a hundred.

385
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,230
Oh, it's empty!

386
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,770
It's empty.

387
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,410
Okay, that's right.

388
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,330
We bought all of it.

389
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,270
That's right.

390
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,650
Let's go.

391
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,930
Oh, wait a second.

392
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,230
There's some more things here.

393
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,950
Do these replenish?

394
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,070
Hey, open up!

395
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,340
Cool, cool, cool.

396
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,620
And then there was this one.

397
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,280
Oh, that's right.

398
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,100
We need to sacrifice our men.

399
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,410
Cool.

400
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,190
Wait a second.

401
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,870
Is this guy stuck?

402
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,370
Oh my god!

403
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:31,930
Help him!

404
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,570
How do I grab again?

405
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,410
Okay, there we go.

406
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,650
Oh my god!

407
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,250
Poor thing!

408
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,890
What do we get?

409
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,530
Oh, he's in...

410
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,470
Why are you making that face at him?

411
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,590
Can't say I've seen this maid cafe before.

412
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,230
Why are you see-through?

413
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,910
Oh, don't worry about it!

414
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,450
Oh my gosh, I wonder if I can spell something.

415
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,960
Uh... I!

416
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,680
N!

417
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:11,980
N!

418
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:13,960
T!

419
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,400
Okay.

420
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,640
I guess that... I don't know what that did.

421
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,560
Oh, sorry.

422
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,700
That was... It's an aggressive pet.

423
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,040
Keith, thank you!

424
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,180
Alright, let's go.

425
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,580
Let's go to another level.

426
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Wait, how do I... Sorry, hold on.

427
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,620
I'm remembering how to play.

428
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,120
Oh, it was right-left trigger.

429
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,680
I'm pretty sure...

430
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:44,760
Ah!

431
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:52,650
Okay.

432
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,550
There's clearly still more here.

433
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,990
Quite a bit, actually.

434
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,090
Let's enter.

435
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,130
Oh, yes!

436
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,790
Yes, yes!

437
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,510
How could I forget?

438
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,530
What's this up here?

439
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,950
No, no, no.

440
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,310
Oh!

441
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:06,830
Oh!

442
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,730
What are you?

443
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,330
Oi!

444
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,430
Wah!

445
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,540
Alex, thank you for five months!

446
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:16,780
Wow!

447
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,680
It's Pyrobug!

448
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,700
Thank you for the 20 gift card!

449
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,280
Where do we want to go?

450
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,160
I guess we gotta go to...

451
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,420
New York City!

452
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,160
Holy cow, there's a ton of guys here.

453
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,800
Brr, brr, brr!

454
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,640
Ah!

455
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,460
Oh!

456
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,140
Ah!

457
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,560
Ah!

458
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,580
Oh my gosh, we're gonna slip!

459
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,340
Ah!

460
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,470
Yeah!

461
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,530
Take that!

462
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,610
Free the bananas!

463
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,030
Free the nanas!

464
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,730
Time to go banana crazy!

465
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,450
Wah!

466
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,250
Wah!

467
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:03,690
Yeah!

468
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,170
Banana, we're going bananas, if you could say.

469
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,370
Oh!

470
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:10,910
Ah!

471
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,630
Ape escape!

472
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,130
Oh!

473
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,450
Power!

474
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:24,330
Oh!

475
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,910
I'm coming for you, monkey!

476
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,710
Yah!

477
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,650
I ain't got time on you!

478
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,830
Wait, L2?

479
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,890
Oh, it's, it's, okay, it's like detecting...

480
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,340
I'm just, I'm, I'm a serial killer!

481
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,220
I'm playing with his head like he's a...

482
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,340
Like he's, he's my toy!

483
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,740
What do I do with you?

484
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,540
Oh, shoot.

485
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:15,860
Ah!

486
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,760
Oh, sorry.

487
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,040
Oh, R2!

488
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,620
Thank you!

489
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,800
Wait, where'd he go?

490
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,180
Ah!

491
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,120
Ah!

492
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,360
Ah!

493
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:29,850
Ah!

494
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:30,230
Ah!

495
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,390
Ah!

496
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,490
Ah!

497
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:30,570
Ah!

498
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:30,870
Ah!

499
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,550
I don't think he want...

500
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,750
Oh, he's so scary.

501
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,430
Look at him.

502
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,510
I don't think he wanted to be rescued.

503
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,550
Hi, everybody!

504
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,430
This is how I can wave at you guys.

505
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,510
Hi!

506
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,910
Don't mind the monkey.

507
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,210
This is how I can wave at you guys.

508
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,330
You can see me waving.

509
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,250
Ah!

510
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:50,690
Hi!

511
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,250
Gets incredibly anxious around nets.

512
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:55,890
Hi!

513
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,630
Oh!

514
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:58,930
Woo!

515
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,150
What if I don't catch him?

516
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,090
What if I don't catch him?

517
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:08,290
Woo!

518
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:09,850
Oh!

519
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,970
He's got magnetic powers.

520
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,530
Okay.

521
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,670
There's gotta be more in here though, right?

522
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,130
There's gotta be more coins and stuff.

523
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,670
Yeah, yeah.

524
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,090
There's gotta be more that I missed.

525
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,750
What about this guy over here?

526
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,720
Technically, this is still Metal Gear.

527
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,500
Yes, it is!

528
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,860
You must capture all the monkeys.

529
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,340
Okay.

530
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,260
Cheggie, you got your nose.

531
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:41,940
Put!

532
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,460
Put!

533
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,940
Try it.

534
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,720
Ty, I'm using this net on you.

535
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,360
Capture all the monkeys.

536
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,580
Can I get you?

537
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,860
Aw, he's just snoozing.

538
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,580
He's snoozing.

539
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,920
Metal Gear adjacent.

540
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,400
It counts.

541
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,120
It counts, it counts, it counts.

542
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:10,860
It counts, it counts, it counts.

543
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,680
Oh my gosh, wait.

544
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,420
I actually have to capture all the monkeys.

545
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,420
Come here!

546
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,680
Come here!

547
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,840
Monkey number two secured.

548
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,660
Actually, why are there so many?

549
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,130
Tony Hawk Pro Skater!

550
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:38,890
Whoa!

551
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,750
Sick!

552
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,530
Sick moves.

553
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,460
Or Sonic.

554
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,160
Or Sonic.

555
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:53,800
Oh.

556
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,180
Oh!

557
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,200
Mm, monkey.

558
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:57,800
Monkey.

559
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,540
Nice.

560
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,460
And there's some more coins in here.

561
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,780
Beat em up, beat em up, beat em up, beat em up!

562
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,420
The music in this level is so fun.

563
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,120
Secret.

564
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,580
Is this guy okay?

565
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:26,660
Okay.

566
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,360
This doesn't look like New York.

567
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,140
It's only the statue of a monkey.

568
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,450
I want to capture the bugs!

569
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,470
This feels like Animal Crossing.

570
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,690
This whole soundtrack is so bubbly.

571
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:45,950
Yeah!

572
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:46,770
So fun.

573
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,930
Love it.

574
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,250
Oh.

575
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:50,750
Oh.

576
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,110
Uh.

577
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,510
Oh.

578
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,160
If I forget a control.

579
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,420
Just remind me.

580
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,720
Don't feel like you are like, Hey Minto.

581
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,000
Minto, you remember you can do this?

582
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,540
It's a-okay if you're like, hey Minto!

583
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,140
Don't forget to do this!

584
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,560
Four little monkeys in a controller.

585
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,640
The three apes you caught have different descriptions.

586
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,080
Oh!

587
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,280
It's just another Manic Monday!

588
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,480
That's my fun day!

589
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,680
Oh no, what did the other one say?

590
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,480
I missed it.

591
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,040
Like this guy.

592
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,820
I like how it's gearing up where...

593
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,000
Oh!

594
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,040
Something's gonna happen at the top.

595
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,090
Don't forget you can be cute and wave to us.

596
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:44,610
Hi!

597
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,100
I don't know about the first part.

598
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,480
Oh!

599
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,660
That's right!

600
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,640
I can pull!

601
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,100
What was it?

602
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,920
Circle or square?

603
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,560
Square!

604
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,220
I know what I need to do!

605
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,370
Love the monkey!

606
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,870
Come here little monkey.

607
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,690
Come here little monkey.

608
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,330
Yeah.

609
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:13,990
Come here.

610
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,250
Come here monkey.

611
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,890
Don't run from me monkey.

612
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,330
I don't think these bots want to be rescued.

613
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,350
I don't think they...

614
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,470
I don't think I'm rescuing them at all.

615
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,570
Oh!

616
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,870
You caught on to my plan monkey!

617
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,650
He's a fast guy.

618
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,810
I'm gonna blow you up.

619
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,190
I'm gonna throw TNT on you.

620
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,390
Yeah!

621
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,250
Yeah!

622
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,610
Five little monkeys in a controller.

623
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,230
How many...

624
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,110
could...

625
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,670
you hold...

626
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,550
hold...

627
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,410
I'm workshopping it, okay guys?

628
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,030
I'm workshopping it.

629
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,550
Nice!

630
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,110
We have some sort of ape escape.

631
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,490
That's... that would be... no.

632
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,770
What are you talking about?

633
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,330
Ape escape?

634
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:26,580
I can choose between beef bok choy stir fry or chicken foot curry for dinner.

635
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,140
Had stir fry, so if you want to become Minto, you can also have stir fry.

636
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,510
He to be Minto is having stir fry.

637
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,870
Taking notes.

638
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,070
Six little monkeys in a controller.

639
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,450
Six little monkeys in a controller.

640
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,960
Six little monkeys in a controller.

641
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,150
Such a way with words.

642
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,670
Take your time.

643
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,890
I'm working on it!

644
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,730
I'm working on it!

645
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,530
We become Minto, can I still shower and put deodorant or do I...

646
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:49,750
No!

647
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,310
What?

648
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,610
That's what I do all the time!

649
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,530
Don't believe Matara's lies.

650
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,600
Okay.

651
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,360
We're gonna go up there, obviously.

652
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,540
But we have...

653
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,340
Look at this guy.

654
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,260
What the...

655
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,780
What is he...

656
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,660
Who is he slapping?

657
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,480
Oh my gosh.

658
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,380
I had him right there.

659
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,520
Where did he go?

660
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,240
I'm chasing him blindly.

661
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,940
Oh.

662
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,500
Monkey!

663
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:33,750
Monkey!

664
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,950
I don't think he was...

665
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,210
Seven little monkeys in a controller.

666
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,730
Though one fell out and...

667
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,640
Did a holler.

668
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,970
Wait, how's the original go?

669
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,490
Five little monkeys jumping on the bed.

670
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,330
One fell out and bumped his head.

671
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,190
What's the rest?

672
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,990
What's the rest?

673
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,850
One fell out and broke their shoulders.

674
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,710
Oh my gosh.

675
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,110
We're not trying to...

676
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,610
We're not trying to kill them.

677
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,230
My goshi.

678
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,650
I'm good.

679
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:28,320
The mama called the doctor and the doctor said, no more monkeys jumping on the bed.

680
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,520
I remember now.

681
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,200
I remember.

682
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:36,560
I remember.

683
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:37,940
Hold on.

684
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,440
Let's grab some of this other stuff that's around here.

685
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,840
Oh.

686
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:43,940
Oh.

687
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,020
Stop.

688
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,740
You sucker.

689
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,660
All right.

690
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,880
Oh, shoot.

691
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,220
Even though I just killed that guy.

692
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,200
Forgot about him.

693
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,280
All right.

694
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,680
Dead.

695
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,920
I'll get them one of these.

696
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,760
This is the worst game of Animal Crossing ever.

697
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,260
What does this thing do?

698
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,500
Looks like the Discord symbol.

699
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:25,800
Oh.

700
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,040
Oh.

701
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:26,860
Oh.

702
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:32,810
Oh.

703
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,270
This is the one that makes you fly.

704
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:37,730
Wait.

705
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,650
How does it work again?

706
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,190
Oh.

707
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:41,570
Oh.

708
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:41,990
Okay.

709
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,150
It's quite fast.

710
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,550
I'm trying to...

711
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,350
I can't even see it.

712
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,210
Wahoo.

713
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:53,610
Weehee.

714
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,350
Okay.

715
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,070
Here we go.

716
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:57,670
What the?

717
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,950
Why is it telling me to L2?

718
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,050
Hold on.

719
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:02,710
Hold on.

720
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,210
I'm not ready.

721
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,560
Double jump.

722
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:06,980
Okay.

723
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,200
Okay.

724
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,380
Okay.

725
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:07,520
Okay.

726
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:07,820
Okay.

727
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,040
Okay.

728
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,100
Okay.

729
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,200
Oh.

730
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,180
Sorry.

731
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:12,820
What?

732
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,680
Oh my gosh.

733
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,180
Please.

734
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,220
Okay.

735
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,480
There we go.

736
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:17,960
All right.

737
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,440
How did I use it?

738
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,540
I think it was square.

739
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,200
There we go.

740
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:23,620
Okay.

741
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:24,920
Oh.

742
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,170
Because it's...

743
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:32,730
Ah!

744
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,030
Come here, monkey.

745
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,370
Come here, monkey.

746
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:37,770
Oh.

747
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,650
I don't want to fall.

748
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,030
Hmm.

749
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,500
Oh.

750
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,060
Oh.

751
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:47,980
Come here, monkey.

752
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,200
I've got to be the fastest there ever was.

753
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,410
Easy-peasy.

754
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:07,650
Eight little monkeys in a controller.

755
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,710
One fell out and broke his shoulder.

756
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,610
The doctor...

757
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,750
Mama called the doctor.

758
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,230
Wait.

759
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:18,530
Minto called the doctor and the doctor said, keep on shaking the monkeys in the controller.

760
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,630
The doctor's orders, you guys.

761
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,460
I'm just kidding.

762
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:31,680
No, I'm not kidding.

763
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:31,900
I'm not kidding.

764
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,020
What's that?

765
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:35,980
Oh.

766
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,640
It's...

767
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,220
My

768
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,660
depth perception!

769
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,400
I can't tell if these are even captureable because I'm so bad at it.

770
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,460
It's like the golden snitch.

771
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,000
Oh my gosh.

772
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,460
You would think I...

773
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:09,540
You would think I...

774
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:09,640
Oh.

775
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:10,660
You would think I...

776
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,860
Oh net profit!

777
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,700
I got a trophy for it and everything.

778
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,020
Let's go.

779
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,620
Do you think I can capture this thing?

780
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,720
Oh my gosh.

781
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,520
Wait, have I just been bad this whole time?

782
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,220
No...

783
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,650
Beep boop.

784
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,130
Beep boop.

785
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,790
Beep boop.

786
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,410
Beep boop.

787
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,490
Beep boop.

788
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,000
Monkey!

789
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,080
It's dangerous!

790
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,600
Oh my god.

791
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,220
Monkey, you can't be like that!

792
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,060
It's so scary!

793
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,120
Oh my gosh, Monkey.

794
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,760
What a thrill.

795
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,520
Yeah, that's right.

796
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,740
How many are in here now?

797
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,580
Not even sure how they got up here.

798
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,600
Skywalking it.

799
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,660
Oh, I keep forgetting to read it because they're all the same.

800
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,400
Whee!

801
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,820
Nice.

802
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,120
So just one monkey left!

803
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,040
Do you think he's up there?

804
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:34,500
Oh.

805
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,440
I think so.

806
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,960
I think we found our prime ape.

807
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,580
Oh my gosh, I've just been bad this whole time.

808
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,220
I'm telling you guys, I have... You would think I have an eyepatch on.

809
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,100
With my dead perception.

810
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,840
You would think...

811
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,000
You would think I have an eyepatch on.

812
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,580
Oh gosh.

813
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,700
There we go.

814
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,020
That means I missed so many coins from before!

815
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,620
Hattori!

816
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,660
Welcome to Mavenship.

817
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,080
Thank you so much.

818
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,840
I hope you enjoy your stay.

819
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,480
I hope you have better depth perception than me.

820
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,700
Thank you.

821
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,880
Thanks for waiting.

822
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,320
I'll be back.

823
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,200
See you.

824
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:41,300
See you.

825
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:41,380
See you.

826
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:41,440
See you.

827
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:41,500
See you.

828
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:45,660
See you.

829
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:46,440
See you.

830
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,060
See you.

831
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,760
I'm getting dizzy.

832
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,020
Naruto?

833
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,650
Mothership's memory.

834
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:14,970
Spectre?

835
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,250
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

836
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,330
Fish and mild.

837
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,070
I ran out of juice just at the last second.

838
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,970
They're fast.

839
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,310
There we go.

840
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,270
Take

841
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:19,880
that!

842
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,920
Oh my gosh.

843
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,480
I gotta capture him, I think.

844
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,940
He's out of breath.

845
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,960
He's out of...

846
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,520
He was out of...

847
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,100
He's out of breath!

848
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,940
Who's this guy?

849
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,340
Albino antagonist.

850
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,020
The naughtiest monkey!

851
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,700
Naughty monkey, yo.

852
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,350
I think I'm the naughtiest monkey.

853
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,270
Yay, we got a ship pod!

854
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:12,530
Nice.

855
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:13,730
Whoa.

856
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,740
Oh, yeah.

857
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:21,620
Wait.

858
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,340
Isn't there supposed to be like a special thing that pops up?

859
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,280
I'm not gonna go.

860
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:25,760
Come on.

861
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,440
Isn't there gonna be like a coin or something?

862
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,520
No?

863
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,240
Oh.

864
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,000
Okay!

865
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,220
Yes, you are.

866
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,980
Thank you.

867
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,760
You are now ready for snake versus monkey.

868
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,400
Oh.

869
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,460
Oh.

870
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,420
I like how all the monkeys are like watching us.

871
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,940
You rescued the mothership's memory.

872
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,440
This song is awesome.

873
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,500
It's in no use in this condition.

874
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:15,900
Oh.

875
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,220
Look!

876
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,720
I'm controlling it!

877
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,760
It's no use in this condition though.

878
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,580
Let's repair it!

879
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,660
Okay, what do I do?

880
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,620
Put that in?

881
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,460
Is this the...

882
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,120
Okay, I'm fixing it, I'm fixing it...

883
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,360
Okay, slowly...

884
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:44,880
Oh!

885
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,370
Nice, it did it all on its own.

886
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,880
And... one big one, one big one.

887
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,520
Hi Snake!

888
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:13,600
Snake!

889
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,580
Can you see me?

890
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,220
Can you see me?

891
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:15,460
Snake!

892
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,140
Watch this, Snake.

893
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:17,800
This one's for you.

894
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,020
This is so fun!

895
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,580
Oh, more, more.

896
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,120
Okay, okay.

897
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:25,860
Snake!

898
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,780
Snake is so impressed!

899
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,920
Oh my god!

900
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,560
Did you see me with the hard eyes?

901
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,170
Be careful, be careful of your...

902
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:49,730
FINGERS!

903
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,610
Okay, here we go.

904
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,070
And... you!

905
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,540
They corrected it?

906
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,960
God, I wish that were me.

907
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:10,540
What am I doing?

908
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,260
Like...

909
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,280
Like this?

910
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,800
Oh, it still works.

911
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,000
You can't mess it up, you guys.

912
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,700
There's only one way you can do it.

913
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,480
I'm like, really schmoving my body right now.

914
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,940
I'm really schmoving my body right now.

915
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,760
I should have played this with 3D.

916
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,280
Here we go.

917
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,000
Ah!

918
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,540
I think she was kicking her feet while she was...

919
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,240
Stop!

920
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,440
Wow!

921
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,890
Our box!

922
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,050
I like the design.

923
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,770
I like the design on it.

924
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,370
Cool.

925
00:42:53,110 --> 00:43:00,430
And it... oh, so we need four of them.

926
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,150
Why the hard eyes though?

927
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:13,510
Unforgettable!

928
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:16,710
Yay!

929
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,550
Oh, because I was still moving my arms around.

930
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,170
Oh my god, it's doxing my age.

931
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,710
Just kidding.

932
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,050
And we got a couple new puzzle pieces.

933
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:32,550
Nice!

934
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:33,990
And we got a couple new puzzle pieces.

935
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:33,990
Nice!

936
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,010
Oh!

937
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:36,910
Hag!

938
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:38,690
Hag!

939
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,910
Is this thing in real time?

940
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,650
I don't know.

941
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,610
It stopped aging a long time ago.

942
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,790
Oh, he's there.

943
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,370
Snake, what do you want to show me?

944
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,190
What do you want to show me?

945
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,250
What do you want to show me, Snake?

946
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:03,250
Gray Fox is stuck in the well?

947
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:04,690
Oh no!

948
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,610
We need 25 guys to help us with this.

949
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,790
Oh gosh, it's a monkey ladder.

950
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:15,990
Wait, do I have to walk across it?

951
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,590
Wait, is Snake in here?

952
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,950
Is that him over there?

953
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,530
Yeah, I see him in the middle.

954
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:23,930
Excuse me!

955
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,410
Excuse me!

956
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:26,690
Excuse me!

957
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:28,190
Excuse me!

958
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:28,390
Sorry!

959
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:30,650
Excuse me!

960
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:31,630
Sorry!

961
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:34,670
Sorry!

962
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,330
Oh, I forgot something.

963
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:39,750
Never mind.

964
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:41,030
I found it in my pocket.

965
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:41,890
Sorry.

966
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:42,530
Hold on.

967
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,710
Oh, you gotta go to the bathroom.

968
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:46,410
Never mind.

969
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:47,630
I'll just wait.

970
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:48,090
Oh!

971
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:50,610
My mom's calling me.

972
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:51,190
Never mind.

973
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:51,970
Leah!

974
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,630
Thank you for the braid!

975
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,030
Sorry, I'm...

976
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,330
I'm being a little...

977
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:00,850
I'm being normal right now.

978
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:03,690
Mostly.

979
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:06,130
Wow, a whole new area!

980
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,990
Oh my gosh, our guy is trapped over there.

981
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:09,950
Look!

982
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,510
Hey, why are there enemies on our...

983
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,990
Oh, you guys just followed me.

984
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,690
It's dangerous!

985
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:16,830
Go back!

986
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,390
It's dangerous!

987
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,290
Can you go back?

988
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,990
He didn't step on my face.

989
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,430
Okay, well soon.

990
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,730
I'll never...

991
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,870
How'd you like that?

992
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,250
You're impressed?

993
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:32,730
You're quite impressed?

994
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,390
These poor guys!

995
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:35,470
They're stuck in jail!

996
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,060
I'm totally fine.

997
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,060
I'm totally normal.

998
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,140
Also, hi everybody!

999
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,120
I'm playing Astro Bot.

1000
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,260
It's so cute.

1001
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,660
It's so awesome.

1002
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,280
It's so fun.

1003
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,780
Oh, dread.

1004
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:50,520
Okay.

1005
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,400
Okay, just drop down.

1006
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,240
This guy is trying to escape.

1007
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,440
No!

1008
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,280
You must join!

1009
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,760
You must join the other bots!

1010
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,640
You're not allowed to leave.

1011
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,900
Okay, there's a lot we can do here.

1012
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,200
Wow!

1013
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,960
Hello monkeys!

1014
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,680
Hello monkeys!

1015
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,920
This game is kind of really awesome.

1016
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:15,540
Yeah!

1017
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,620
I'm zapping your butts.

1018
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:24,810
They're monkeys.

1019
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:25,690
They're monkeys.

1020
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,470
Stop being so pretentious.

1021
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:29,350
Haruka!

1022
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:30,390
Thank you for the gift!

1023
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:30,850
Arigato!

1024
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:32,950
Hello?

1025
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,210
Gosh, the way they all shuffle over.

1026
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,510
Oh my goodness.

1027
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,750
This doesn't seem very... Why did I need 20 of you guys?

1028
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,710
Oh, there's something down there.

1029
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,350
I'm scared though.

1030
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:50,150
I'm scared.

1031
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,170
Oh my gosh, why is he looking like that?

1032
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,310
He's like, don't look at my skirt, cat!

1033
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,270
Okay, we're going down.

1034
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:12,570
I got a creative cursor.

1035
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:14,870
Make your dreams come true.

1036
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:15,910
Where is this guy from?

1037
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:17,930
Beamers are still kind of monkeys.

1038
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,270
Yeah, you guys!

1039
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:20,810
They're still monkeys.

1040
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,190
Dreams.

1041
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:27,750
From dreams.

1042
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:30,790
Okay, we're done!

1043
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,690
You guys are good now.

1044
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,280
You guys are all...

1045
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,100
They wait my next order.

1046
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:39,700
Where's Snake?

1047
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,360
Oh, he's over here.

1048
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,260
You didn't want to help me out?

1049
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:45,840
That's fine.

1050
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,380
What's this?

1051
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:48,400
Excuse me.

1052
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,790
You're free!

1053
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:12,630
She's never freeing those four.

1054
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,570
They'll come out eventually.

1055
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,570
I have other impressing matters.

1056
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,910
I want to get all these other ones first.

1057
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,010
Like this one.

1058
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:22,590
Hello!

1059
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:24,530
What are we doing here?

1060
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:26,630
Oh...

1061
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:27,810
Oh...

1062
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:28,730
Oh...

1063
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:28,970
Oh!

1064
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:29,430
Oh!

1065
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,990
And you!

1066
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:33,990
Boing!

1067
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,570
Boing!

1068
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:35,070
Boing!

1069
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:35,970
Boing!

1070
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:36,450
Boing!

1071
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,370
Oh!

1072
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:40,930
Another...

1073
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:42,910
Spyro!

1074
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,030
Oh my god!

1075
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:46,570
He's so cute!

1076
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,150
Fiery artisan!

1077
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,750
Last spotted in the sky!

1078
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:53,130
Spyro!

1079
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:55,750
I love Spyro so much!

1080
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:56,210
Alright!

1081
00:48:59,270 --> 00:48:59,590
Yeah!

1082
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:00,950
Oh no!

1083
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:01,750
That guy's getting harassed!

1084
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:03,090
I'm coming!

1085
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:03,530
I'm coming!

1086
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:04,810
I'm coming!

1087
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:05,070
I'm coming!

1088
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,900
I love Spyro!

1089
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,440
Oh!

1090
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,740
What the?

1091
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:16,580
Wait!

1092
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,000
What just happened?

1093
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,520
I went away too far.

1094
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,140
Okay, my bad.

1095
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:19,940
Do it again!

1096
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,340
Do it again!

1097
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,220
Oh my god!

1098
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,000
Snake is on the bottom!

1099
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,160
Okay, Snake!

1100
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,480
I'm gonna... I'm gonna climb!

1101
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:26,760
Snake!

1102
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,300
I'm gonna climb!

1103
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,040
Noooo!

1104
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,020
Literal wall climber.

1105
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,440
Ow!

1106
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,600
Oh!

1107
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:41,940
Sorry!

1108
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:42,460
Wait!

1109
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,320
Wait!

1110
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,600
Wait!

1111
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,380
No!

1112
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,480
I

1113
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,140
didn't...

1114
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:01,420
I...

1115
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,380
I was like...

1116
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,500
Why are you just standing there?

1117
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,560
I didn't know!

1118
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,500
I didn't know!

1119
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,320
I didn't know!

1120
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,780
I didn't...

1121
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,440
You

1122
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:37,610
killed a child!

1123
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:38,830
That's why you're the best boss!

1124
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:40,410
I didn't know!

1125
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:44,330
Are you gonna find new places for us to go to?

1126
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:45,390
Are you gonna find new places for us to go to?

1127
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:47,630
Woah!

1128
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:50,350
The taco way!

1129
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:53,850
Nice!

1130
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,510
Wait!

1131
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:55,710
Hold on though!

1132
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:57,790
Do you think he's really gone?

1133
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:58,810
Do you think he's really dead?

1134
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:00,990
Rip those four.

1135
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,410
Well, I'm gonna go get them right now.

1136
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:03,470
Rip those four.

1137
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:03,490
Well, I'm gonna go get them right now.

1138
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:05,850
I'm gonna go get them right now.

1139
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:06,910
Yes.

1140
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:09,850
I'm faster than you, Snake.

1141
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:10,630
I'm faster than you.

1142
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:13,150
Spyro!

1143
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,370
Why didn't you salute me?

1144
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:17,950
Ow!

1145
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:22,850
Oh my gosh.

1146
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:24,490
Let's stay crisp.

1147
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,140
I feel so...

1148
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,120
Excuse me!

1149
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:42,740
Who's shaking?

1150
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,100
Who's gyrating right here?

1151
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,080
Psycho Mantis!

1152
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,460
Of course you would be.

1153
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,460
What a freak.

1154
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,900
What a freak.

1155
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,140
What a freak.

1156
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,220
Nice whistling.

1157
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,440
I know, I'm a pretty good whistler.

1158
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:08,920
Me too!

1159
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,010
See, we have 52.

1160
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,270
52 out of 300.

1161
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:18,350
52 out of 300.

1162
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:19,790
Oh wait!

1163
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,030
We can do this one now!

1164
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:22,570
Oh my gosh, awesome!

1165
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:22,690
Awesome!

1166
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:31,790
Now we need another 20?

1167
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,380
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1168
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,360
Sorry, sorry.

1169
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,100
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1170
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,220
Okay, there's a guy in here.

1171
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,080
We got...

1172
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,540
Oh my gosh!

1173
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:56,380
Amaterasu!

1174
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,240
Celestial Painter!

1175
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,000
Celestial Painter!

1176
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,360
The physical incarnation of a god!

1177
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,500
So freaky.

1178
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:09,880
Oh, that's it.

1179
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,020
Oh wait, there's nothing else up here?

1180
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,380
Nope, just some monkeys.

1181
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:15,940
Okamiya!

1182
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:17,760
Wow!

1183
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,920
There's so many games in here that I didn't expect to see.

1184
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:22,440
There's so many games in here that I didn't expect to see.

1185
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,840
The one over here was 50, right?

1186
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,800
There's also that puzzle piece up there.

1187
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,120
There's also that puzzle piece up there.

1188
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,820
Or, I'm sorry, this was 100, right?

1189
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:32,800
How

1190
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,720
do we get to this one?

1191
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,460
I'm assuming it's from up here?

1192
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,180
The flowers make noises?

1193
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,580
So cute!

1194
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,640
Ta-da!

1195
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,600
Uh, wait!

1196
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,680
Oh, wait!

1197
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,220
I can't get up there?

1198
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,340
Oh, wait.

1199
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:02,680
Oh?

1200
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,640
So, never mind, it must be...

1201
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:07,540
...somehow.

1202
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:10,740
How?

1203
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,760
Poor guy on the wall.

1204
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,480
Can I get him?

1205
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,420
Maybe from here.

1206
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,540
Oh!

1207
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,280
Oh, maybe it's the 100 is for the tree.

1208
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,200
Ok, we'll wait then.

1209
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,860
You're part of my party, right?

1210
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,580
Yeah.

1211
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,280
Ok, good.

1212
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,180
Ta-da-da!

1213
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,480
No!

1214
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:44,820
Wow!

1215
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,040
Ok.

1216
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,880
I don't think there was anything else that...

1217
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,700
Oh my gosh, so cute!

1218
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,900
They're fine!

1219
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,640
They're fine.

1220
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,100
They're fine.

1221
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,100
Oh my gosh, he has his own little, like, army.

1222
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,700
What are you...

1223
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,640
Oh, he wants the gacha.

1224
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,260
Ok, let's go do more gacha, you guys.

1225
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,880
Ta-da!

1226
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,460
Oh,

1227
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:29,800
yes!

1228
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:30,800
Yes!

1229
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,360
I'm grabbing you.

1230
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:37,840
Alright.

1231
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:38,360
Ha!

1232
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,160
Noise generator!

1233
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,720
Just beat it!

1234
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,120
Beat it!

1235
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:49,560
Next.

1236
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:54,450
Mastermind's throne!

1237
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,110
Take over the world in comfort and...

1238
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:57,470
Oh!

1239
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:59,050
In comfort and style!

1240
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,410
Cute.

1241
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,190
Keep those grabby hands away from me.

1242
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:07,250
Oh, I can't grab anymore.

1243
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:08,210
It's not letting me.

1244
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:10,010
Ha!

1245
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:12,710
Summer essential...

1246
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:14,210
Look at how chill this guy is.

1247
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:17,070
The most chill monkey...

1248
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:17,290
Oh!

1249
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:20,430
Oh my god, he's dead.

1250
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,220
I was gonna grab you guys.

1251
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:25,620
Ha!

1252
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,280
For great...

1253
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,460
Oh my gosh, thank you, monkey.

1254
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,040
Wow!

1255
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,860
He's so wise.

1256
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:40,980
Sorry.

1257
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,180
Just a box!

1258
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,640
Blend in box 3000.

1259
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,760
I love this game!

1260
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,440
Oh no, I don't have enough.

1261
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,320
Okay, we'll have to go get more coins, everybody.

1262
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,640
Missile gear.

1263
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,200
So cute!

1264
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,040
Every monkey gets a little special thing.

1265
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,500
Oh, it locked up.

1266
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,440
So cute!

1267
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,080
No!

1268
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,660
He's like, hey!

1269
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,400
Hey!

1270
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,920
Trying to monkey around here.

1271
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,400
Oh!

1272
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:31,860
You okay?

1273
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:32,800
He's fine.

1274
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,340
Yeah!

1275
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,500
It's literally the same animation, but with the monkey.

1276
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,060
It's so funny.

1277
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,180
Press triangle?

1278
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:41,980
What's triangle do?

1279
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,040
Oh!

1280
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,010
Everybody's here!

1281
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,670
Why are you so obsessed with me, huh?

1282
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:59,090
Why are you so obsessed with me?

1283
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:00,090
Get to the back of the line!

1284
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:03,970
Push through all of them to get to Snake.

1285
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:04,670
Snake!

1286
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:05,730
I'm here.

1287
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,310
Grey Fox.

1288
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:08,730
Grey Fox.

1289
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:10,170
Psycho Mantis.

1290
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:12,310
We need more money.

1291
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,010
D-pad also does stuff?

1292
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:14,530
No way.

1293
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:26,290
Spyro is killing me.

1294
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:28,290
Why is he just like...

1295
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:30,650
Spyro!

1296
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,290
It's a dance party!

1297
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:37,950
Spyro can't do anything.

1298
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,150
He's just like convulsing.

1299
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,620
Did I turn around and you guys started to floss?

1300
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,040
Did I turn around and you guys started to floss?

1301
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,400
Don't start jumping up and down for that.

1302
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:51,740
Don't start jumping up and down for that.

1303
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,300
Oh my god.

1304
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:57,670
Stop it.

1305
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:00,410
Hey you.

1306
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:11,410
Look at Spyro trying to floss.

1307
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,150
And then Dream is just like...

1308
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,750
And then Dream is just like...

1309
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,090
Oh my gosh!

1310
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:21,450
Look at the monkeys are killing me.

1311
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:22,590
Look at the monkeys are killing me.

1312
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:23,390
This world is so funny.

1313
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,590
I love this.

1314
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:28,130
Oh my gosh!

1315
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:30,890
Wait, I just noticed Amaterasu over here.

1316
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:31,930
Why don't you come join us?

1317
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:39,770
Okay, let's all dance now!

1318
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,280
That was silly.

1319
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,420
I can't get over Spyro being...

1320
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,280
Just not being able to do anything.

1321
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,400
Okay.

1322
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:51,720
Too regal, yeah.

1323
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:52,880
Clearly.

1324
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,520
Let's go do more levels.

1325
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,060
The god does not dance.

1326
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,020
I don't think there was anything else...

1327
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,880
I could do here yet, so...

1328
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:10,990
Was there...

1329
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:12,130
Did I get everything in here?

1330
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:13,910
Well, clearly not.

1331
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:15,570
But...

1332
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:18,330
Oh, we still have just a few...

1333
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:20,030
Robots.

1334
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:22,910
But I am curious what's in Taco World.

1335
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:27,150
Just like Fortnite.

1336
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,670
Oh my god!

1337
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:30,230
Eww!

1338
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:33,450
Stop!

1339
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:36,250
Oh my gosh, how rude!

1340
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:41,010
Crab.

1341
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:43,610
Big bad.

1342
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:46,150
So rude.

1343
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:46,870
Go, go!

1344
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:48,570
Archipelago!

1345
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:53,840
Connie.

1346
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,320
Oh.

1347
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:58,140
Woah.

1348
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:00,420
Woah.

1349
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,260
Woah.

1350
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:02,860
Ouch.

1351
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,540
So close!

1352
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,020
We're gonna have to come back.

1353
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,420
Oh my gosh.

1354
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,120
Even the guys are on...

1355
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,380
They're just on break.

1356
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,140
Look at them.

1357
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:22,780
They don't want to fight me.

1358
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,980
They just want to be on vacation.

1359
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,000
Right?

1360
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:28,700
Oh.

1361
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:34,870
You guys just want to be on vacation.

1362
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:36,550
You guys just want to be on vacation.

1363
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:36,850
Oh.

1364
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:39,770
Yeah.

1365
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:41,090
Take that.

1366
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,570
This guy is really living his life.

1367
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:48,130
This guy

1368
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:54,010
is really living his life.

1369
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,210
Oh, I can swim.

1370
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:55,650
Oh, I can swim.

1371
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:58,710
I thought I would die in the water.

1372
01:01:58,850 --> 01:01:59,510
For real.

1373
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:02,030
Can I actually swim-swim?

1374
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:03,730
Oh.

1375
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,400
Chill, BJ.

1376
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:21,480
I'm so chill.

1377
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,980
I know, I feel...

1378
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,360
I feel really chill right now.

1379
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,140
I'm not gonna lie.

1380
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,640
Let's get that turtle.

1381
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,190
I feel so chill right now, for real.

1382
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:46,230
Oh.

1383
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,060
Oh, hold on.

1384
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,160
Oh, wait, hold on.

1385
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:51,980
My turn.

1386
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:52,220
Oh.

1387
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,580
Oh, I did it.

1388
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:55,940
Ow.

1389
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:56,600
Stop.

1390
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:57,920
Let me go through the hole.

1391
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,440
Little baby turtles.

1392
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,500
This is so cute.

1393
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,760
Happy family.

1394
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,560
They're so cute.

1395
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:19,630
Nice.

1396
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:25,050
Let me in.

1397
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:25,590
Let me in.

1398
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:25,810
Ow.

1399
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,290
Oh.

1400
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:29,530
Ah.

1401
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:32,860
Oh.

1402
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:33,500
Not bad.

1403
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,400
No way.

1404
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,200
I started at the beginning.

1405
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:41,500
Guys.

1406
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,100
Get good.

1407
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,260
Or else you pay the price.

1408
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,220
I'm getting this guy first.

1409
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:55,820
Oh, no.

1410
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:57,600
Oh, my gosh.

1411
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,020
Wait.

1412
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,380
They have eye patches.

1413
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,900
Oh, they're so cute.

1414
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:07,430
I got it, guys.

1415
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,040
I'm just a regular guy.

1416
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:14,960
Lizard.

1417
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:18,380
Take him home.

1418
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,780
That was definitely solidus.

1419
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:26,340
Yeah.

1420
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:26,740
Oh.

1421
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:34,070
Minto depth perception strikes again.

1422
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,910
Not a single...

1423
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:38,830
Not a single one.

1424
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:46,050
Oh, my gosh.

1425
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:47,950
Minto depth perception strikes.

1426
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:49,090
Oh.

1427
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:50,650
Again.

1428
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:54,290
Yeah.

1429
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:57,870
I missed one.

1430
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:02,190
Should I try again?

1431
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:05,710
I think I won't be satisfied until I get all of it.

1432
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:05,890
You know?

1433
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,040
Again?

1434
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:11,580
Okay.

1435
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,080
Give me a second.

1436
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,920
We were here.

1437
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:17,940
Let's get all this first and everything.

1438
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:18,380
Remember?

1439
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:22,360
Yeah.

1440
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:22,820
There we go.

1441
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,580
Let's collect all our stuff that we...

1442
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,280
That we...

1443
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,060
Because we died.

1444
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:30,220
Think of the gacha.

1445
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:30,660
Yeah.

1446
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:31,200
We'll get it.

1447
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:31,540
We'll get it.

1448
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:31,780
Don't worry.

1449
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:33,400
Oh.

1450
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,700
Is there anything over here?

1451
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,680
How far can I go?

1452
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:48,000
No one knows.

1453
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,920
How far out goes.

1454
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:57,260
Oh.

1455
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,020
I forgot it was this guy.

1456
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:02,600
Nice.

1457
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,660
How do I get up here?

1458
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,100
How do I get to you?

1459
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,140
Glad we...

1460
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,000
I don't have like a...

1461
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,660
Oxygen meter.

1462
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:15,880
Maybe from above.

1463
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,480
Or maybe I can just run and jump.

1464
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,100
Easy.

1465
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,980
Give me your weasel.

1466
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:28,720
Oh no.

1467
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,140
He's abandoning the weasel.

1468
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,220
Karaoke ended.

1469
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:33,140
Oh.

1470
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,220
No one knows.

1471
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,240
I'm gonna destroy your house.

1472
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:38,200
So you'll never come back.

1473
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:38,440
Okay?

1474
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:40,500
You'll never feel a need to...

1475
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,640
To wanna live here again.

1476
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:44,180
Destroy.

1477
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,820
Eco-terrorism.

1478
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:47,700
Eco-terrorism.

1479
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:48,840
Yeah.

1480
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,960
Now this guy will never be like.

1481
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:57,560
Aw man.

1482
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:58,820
I missed my shell house.

1483
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,560
No you don't.

1484
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,300
It's destroyed.

1485
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:02,340
There's nothing left of it.

1486
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:04,540
Punch.

1487
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:04,860
Punch.

1488
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:05,180
Punch.

1489
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:05,420
Punch.

1490
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:06,680
Punch.

1491
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:06,800
Punch.

1492
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:08,880
Hi.

1493
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:09,760
My name is Kathy.

1494
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:10,920
This is my house.

1495
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:11,720
Isn't it ours?

1496
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:13,180
No.

1497
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:14,140
Cause it's destroyed.

1498
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,000
Okay.

1499
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,500
What's this?

1500
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,480
Secret.

1501
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:22,920
Oh.

1502
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:31,840
Maybe I should die.

1503
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:32,620
Restart.

1504
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,280
She lost the gacho.

1505
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,020
I think I was just...

1506
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,220
I think I might do it like this.

1507
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:47,340
I think I might do it like this.

1508
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,300
It'd be better.

1509
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,560
Min, did you just quote Vermillion?

1510
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:54,380
Wow.

1511
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,920
You got the reference.

1512
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:57,640
Yay!

1513
01:07:58,660 --> 01:07:59,140
Oh.

1514
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:00,100
Sorry little turtles.

1515
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:01,620
Sorry.

1516
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:01,940
Sorry.

1517
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:02,420
Oh.

1518
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,640
I also have to jump through the hoop.

1519
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,140
Sorry.

1520
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:05,140
Sorry.

1521
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:05,140
Oh.

1522
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:05,140
I also have to jump through the hoop.

1523
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:05,640
Sorry.

1524
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:08,880
Sorry.

1525
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:09,760
Oh.

1526
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:09,760
I also have to jump through the hoop.

1527
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:09,900
Wait.

1528
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,480
Biki my shell.

1529
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,580
How do I defeat this guy again?

1530
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,680
That's right.

1531
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:35,240
There we go.

1532
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,440
What was it?

1533
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,600
Please remind me.

1534
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,120
Game.

1535
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,100
Game.

1536
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:45,980
I don't remember what to do.

1537
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,880
I gotta do a swirly.

1538
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,740
Oh I gotta power up.

1539
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:51,580
I gotta power up.

1540
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,080
I got

1541
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,160
an actual monkey!

1542
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,200
Oh my gosh.

1543
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,440
Oh an actual monkey.

1544
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:04,600
What?

1545
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:05,600
Oh no.

1546
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,440
Oh.

1547
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,040
How do I move my arm?

1548
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,180
How do I move my...

1549
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:12,280
Oh.

1550
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:13,360
Okay.

1551
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:14,820
Oh wow!

1552
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,160
Go go!

1553
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,660
Oh you are actual monkeys.

1554
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:20,960
You're not little robot friends.

1555
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:26,130
Tilt the controller.

1556
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:26,530
Yeah.

1557
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:27,170
It's kinda weird.

1558
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:27,490
Oh.

1559
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:28,050
My bad.

1560
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:28,890
Okay.

1561
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:43,470
Monkey backpack.

1562
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:47,670
Can I just beat you up?

1563
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:51,610
I tickle you till you open.

1564
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:54,770
Oh I gotta.

1565
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:55,890
Oh I gotta grip him.

1566
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:57,490
Nah!

1567
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:01,010
And we gotta grab these.

1568
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,490
And we gotta...

1569
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,020
Grippers!

1570
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:14,700
Grippers!

1571
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,140
These are some monkey claws.

1572
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:22,180
Okay we got a couple more to throw.

1573
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:24,760
Can't miss.

1574
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:25,360
Can't miss.

1575
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:27,780
Can't miss.

1576
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,380
Can't miss.

1577
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:30,260
I have one more though.

1578
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,880
What am I supposed to throw it at?

1579
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,200
Who's my victim?

1580
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:36,880
The birds?

1581
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,040
Must be right?

1582
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,120
Who am I to throw this at?

1583
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,000
Who am I to throw this at?

1584
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:45,020
Who am I to throw this at?

1585
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:48,040
I'm just gonna take it with me as a little souvenir I guess.

1586
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:48,560
I'm just gonna take it with me as a little souvenir I guess.

1587
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:48,820
Oh.

1588
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,000
Oh.

1589
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,000
I missed?

1590
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:55,720
Hey!

1591
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:57,360
Uh.

1592
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:03,490
We have ranged attacks now!

1593
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:08,790
Yeah!

1594
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:11,550
This is some real monkey business.

1595
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:15,350
Let's get this guy too.

1596
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,230
Did we lose?

1597
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:20,950
No!

1598
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:22,330
No we haven't even lost one.

1599
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:23,650
Kind of awesome.

1600
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:26,270
Where?

1601
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:26,630
Oh.

1602
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:28,450
And they respawn!

1603
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:28,950
Come on!

1604
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,570
Aww yeah baby!

1605
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:46,950
Good.

1606
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:49,770
Nice.

1607
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:50,210
Nice.

1608
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:51,010
Yes everybody.

1609
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:51,690
Nice.

1610
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:52,170
Nice.

1611
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:54,390
Nice.

1612
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:55,090
Nice.

1613
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:55,290
Nice.

1614
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:01,070
Oh I think I need to use my hands here.

1615
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:04,310
Hands!

1616
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:05,370
Oh!

1617
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:05,410
Oh!

1618
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:12,960
And this guy is also...

1619
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:14,530
Oh!

1620
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:16,350
Oh!

1621
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:17,710
Oh!

1622
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,010
There's a little guy in there!

1623
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:22,750
You're welcome!

1624
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:25,070
You're welcome!

1625
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:27,730
Yes.

1626
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,480
I'm taking this with me.

1627
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,480
Who is that in there?

1628
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:39,320
Who is that in there?

1629
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:47,560
I see...

1630
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,620
Oh wow there's so much around here.

1631
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,960
Oh my gosh look how cute!

1632
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,760
The little symbols in the water!

1633
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:57,160
What?

1634
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,100
That's so cute!

1635
01:12:58,820 --> 01:12:59,580
Break the glass?

1636
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,620
No I know what we need to do.

1637
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:02,880
I gotta use my arms.

1638
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:03,640
Wait.

1639
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,020
How do I get that up there?

1640
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:05,500
Monkey!

1641
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,280
Just climb higher!

1642
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:14,290
Just go up!

1643
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:17,790
Wait.

1644
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:20,970
I think I need to shoot this monkey into the tree.

1645
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:22,810
Use the rock.

1646
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:26,810
Where do I put the rock?

1647
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:27,430
Oh there it is.

1648
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:40,210
You guys it...

1649
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:41,290
It didn't work.

1650
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:44,730
That's okay.

1651
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:51,290
How am I supposed to aim up?

1652
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:54,810
Oh I don't think I can use this to go down.

1653
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:57,010
That's a shame.

1654
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:58,610
How can I just go down though?

1655
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:02,010
Should I just jump down I wonder?

1656
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:04,930
We'll see if we go down from here.

1657
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:10,340
Pew!

1658
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,780
And then I see over there there's some stuff as well.

1659
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,800
Smash the bridge?

1660
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,360
Well hold on.

1661
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,460
We got stuff in here first.

1662
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,000
We got stuff in here.

1663
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:23,780
We got our monkey...

1664
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:25,020
Monkey!

1665
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:27,960
Mon...

1666
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:45,530
Maybe... oh.

1667
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:46,790
See there's more.

1668
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:48,130
Gosh there's so much to explore.

1669
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:50,550
There's so much to explore.

1670
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,520
Oh my gosh!

1671
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:04,150
I did something.

1672
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:05,610
Oh!

1673
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:10,350
That's how we get over there.

1674
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:12,350
Oh my gosh be careful.

1675
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:18,190
Every nook and cranny.

1676
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:19,150
I know.

1677
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:21,650
This world is crazy.

1678
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,670
There's so much in here.

1679
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:25,690
Nice!

1680
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:38,830
Use my grippers?

1681
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:42,650
Use my grippers?

1682
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:44,610
And then... gripper?

1683
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:46,330
Gripper?

1684
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:47,230
Gripper.

1685
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:51,590
What is this?

1686
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:00,410
What is this?

1687
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:00,850
Do I grip?

1688
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:02,310
Wait I

1689
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:14,290
think I got a job.

1690
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:16,490
Oh!

1691
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:17,450
Oh my gosh.

1692
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:18,250
I'm actually so good?

1693
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:20,510
Who said I'm not a gamer?

1694
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:22,390
Who said?

1695
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:27,550
What the hell is this?

1696
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:31,730
Horned protector.

1697
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:33,630
Stick to the shadows.

1698
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:35,030
Who is this?

1699
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:36,410
It was me.

1700
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:37,010
Sorry!

1701
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:43,340
Aiko.

1702
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,860
Shadow of the Colossus.

1703
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,320
Oh!

1704
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:49,340
Oh!

1705
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,080
Oh!

1706
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,720
Maybe that was supposed to get him down.

1707
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,280
My bad.

1708
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,620
Maybe that was how I was supposed to do that puzzle.

1709
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,440
No worries.

1710
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,200
So let's go back down here.

1711
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,260
Can I even do it here?

1712
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:08,040
Down.

1713
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,040
Oh my god!

1714
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,520
How is this possible?

1715
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:15,840
Ah!

1716
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:20,260
They're scared!

1717
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:21,520
They're scared!

1718
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,420
They're alone and they're scared!

1719
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:23,660
They're naked and afraid!

1720
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,740
Winky physics.

1721
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,580
Do you think I can go through here?

1722
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:30,980
Aha!

1723
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:36,160
This is how I don't die.

1724
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:36,980
Hello!

1725
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:42,140
Elfin prisoner.

1726
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,180
Needs to be led by the hand.

1727
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:48,440
Yorda?

1728
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:49,460
I don't know this one either.

1729
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:51,800
Oh!

1730
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:53,200
Aloha!

1731
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:58,740
Oh my gosh!

1732
01:17:58,820 --> 01:17:59,380
The trees!

1733
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:02,300
Oh my gosh!

1734
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,280
We have such a cool monkey!

1735
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,980
Oh my gosh!

1736
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:08,760
Aloha!

1737
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:14,460
Nice.

1738
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:15,980
Aiko.

1739
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:16,940
Am I saying it right?

1740
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:18,600
Or is it like ICO?

1741
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,600
Am I saying it correct?

1742
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:21,080
Wow!

1743
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:21,320
Wow!

1744
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:28,900
Aloha!

1745
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:29,500
Aloha!

1746
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,520
What do I do with this guy?

1747
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:38,340
What do I do with this guy?

1748
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:38,620
Hmm...

1749
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:40,200
Hmm...

1750
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:42,440
Oh my gosh!

1751
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:42,840
We're slow.

1752
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,460
What do I do with...

1753
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:45,640
Oh!

1754
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:45,980
I see!

1755
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:46,400
Nice!

1756
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:53,780
The ICO is silent.

1757
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:54,020
The ICO is silent.

1758
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:54,060
Oh!

1759
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,500
It's... Oh, so their name is...

1760
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:58,940
I got you.

1761
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,740
I got you.

1762
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:02,160
Which one is it?

1763
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:02,300
Oh!

1764
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:02,560
This one!

1765
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:04,860
Push...

1766
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:07,980
Oh!

1767
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:10,480
Oh my gosh!

1768
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:11,900
Oh my gosh!

1769
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:14,260
You almost died in here!

1770
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,800
You almost died in here!

1771
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:21,240
For real!

1772
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:21,440
Oh!

1773
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,020
Wait.

1774
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:25,760
Where did the skeleton go?

1775
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:27,820
Oh!

1776
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,040
Where?

1777
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:35,420
Oh!

1778
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,300
I smashed it!

1779
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:36,580
Oh!

1780
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:40,400
Toasty!

1781
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:41,940
Oh!

1782
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:42,500
So cute!

1783
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,880
Such good attention to detail in this game.

1784
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,080
Awesome!

1785
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,840
Okay, so we have one bot left.

1786
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,680
We're gonna have to come back though for the puzzle piece.

1787
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:54,500
Wait, what's over here?

1788
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:56,540
Nothing.

1789
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:57,640
Sorry, it was really bright.

1790
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:01,420
Oh!

1791
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,240
Now

1792
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,860
we can continue our work!

1793
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,680
I didn't mean to destroy the skeleton.

1794
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:16,080
I didn't mean to destroy the skeleton.

1795
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:16,600
Oh wait!

1796
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:18,580
I forgot about...

1797
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:20,440
This one too.

1798
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:27,510
I want the coins.

1799
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:27,870
Give me the coins!

1800
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:30,350
Give me the coins!

1801
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,800
Wait though.

1802
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:46,180
We still haven't discovered how to get this chest out of the...

1803
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:49,580
Greedy ghost!

1804
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:51,800
Greedy ghost!

1805
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,100
Isn't it okay if Minto is greedy?

1806
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,060
Just a little bit?

1807
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,600
Just a little?

1808
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,620
What is this?

1809
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,080
Oh!

1810
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:04,540
Woah!

1811
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:17,840
Just...

1812
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,140
Just a little as a treat?

1813
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:19,980
Yippee!

1814
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,240
Maybe we can get to it...

1815
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,140
From up there.

1816
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:26,860
You think?

1817
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:30,800
I want that box.

1818
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,320
Clearly it's special, you know?

1819
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:48,220
Use your monkey powers.

1820
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,560
We're gonna run out of...

1821
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,960
We're gonna run...

1822
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:55,600
Oh no!

1823
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:58,060
Ah!

1824
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,060
We got it!

1825
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:02,820
Alright, we're never...

1826
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,600
Oh my gosh, it's a pop-up pirate game.

1827
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:53,860
A pop-up pirate game.

1828
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:56,000
Yay!

1829
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,040
I think that's all of them.

1830
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:57,320
Isn't it?

1831
01:22:59,060 --> 01:22:59,500
Yippee!

1832
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:01,220
We got them all!

1833
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:03,660
Nice.

1834
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:08,890
Okay.

1835
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:10,970
Very good.

1836
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:19,360
Nice.

1837
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:21,240
Oh my gosh.

1838
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:22,820
Woah!

1839
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,080
Oh!

1840
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:25,800
Oh my god.

1841
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:32,450
I forgot to jump.

1842
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:33,670
My bad.

1843
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:36,170
Is he...

1844
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:36,690
Oh, okay.

1845
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:37,390
We still got him.

1846
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:39,750
Fish and mail.

1847
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:41,190
No, no.

1848
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:42,930
We're okay.

1849
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,370
Spooked me though, for real.

1850
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:48,330
Oh my gosh.

1851
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:49,850
Woah!

1852
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:52,210
Oh, he's like walking around even!

1853
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:55,070
Hey!

1854
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:55,970
Hey!

1855
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:00,420
Oh my gosh!

1856
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:00,480
Oh my gosh!

1857
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:04,560
Got him.

1858
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:06,080
Got his butt.

1859
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:09,220
Platformers.

1860
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:11,820
Okay, okay.

1861
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:12,220
Here we go.

1862
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:14,020
Oh!

1863
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,300
Kind of a genius.

1864
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:17,840
Ah!

1865
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:19,220
Oh!

1866
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:30,550
Is there anything that looks like I missed?

1867
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:34,530
Clearly we missed a secret portal.

1868
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:37,430
And we missed...

1869
01:24:38,430 --> 01:24:40,550
I know I missed one...

1870
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:41,350
What's this?

1871
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:44,450
By the skull.

1872
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:46,990
On the top right.

1873
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:48,830
There's an X.

1874
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:51,150
What does it mean?

1875
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,030
Treasure map.

1876
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:55,710
Um...

1877
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:59,570
I know I missed the one puzzle piece at the very beginning.

1878
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:00,910
Cause I...

1879
01:25:01,610 --> 01:25:01,970
Um...

1880
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:03,750
I

1881
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,600
know I missed the one.

1882
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,020
Maybe there's one more later on.

1883
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,040
Cause it's...

1884
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,140
We got the second one.

1885
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:36,930
This is kind of tricky.

1886
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:41,850
You can move the other hand on the same...

1887
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:42,470
Oh!

1888
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:44,050
Oh my gosh.

1889
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:49,130
Reach!

1890
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:50,170
Reach monkey!

1891
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:59,420
Here I was like hard-moding it.

1892
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:00,020
For real.

1893
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,360
I was making it so much harder than it is.

1894
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:07,820
Yeah!

1895
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:13,380
What's this though?

1896
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:15,300
Oh!

1897
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:20,790
Oh!

1898
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:22,870
Oh!

1899
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:24,090
Oh!

1900
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:25,930
Oh!

1901
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:28,990
Do I need this?

1902
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:29,350
Nope.

1903
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:32,470
Got that.

1904
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:34,170
Self-imposed handicap.

1905
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:34,730
I know.

1906
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:38,170
Look, I like a challenge, okay?

1907
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:41,330
Even if I have to create it myself.

1908
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:42,470
Yeah!

1909
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:52,410
Oh, okay, I get it.

1910
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:02,490
Oh!

1911
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:02,930
Wait!

1912
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:04,390
This is the skull!

1913
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:06,130
It's on the top right.

1914
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:07,730
Wait, in his eye?

1915
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:10,290
His eye looks like it can be cracked, right?

1916
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:24,720
Oh, nice.

1917
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:29,760
Hold on, let's get to the top first.

1918
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:32,720
Why'd the music stop?

1919
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:35,960
Maybe there.

1920
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:36,560
Wait.

1921
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,120
Why'd the music stop?

1922
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:48,190
Hold on.

1923
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:54,510
Wait, can I...

1924
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:56,250
Dig!

1925
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:01,900
Boss time.

1926
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:03,700
But what about the secret?

1927
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:06,140
What about the secret, you guys?

1928
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:09,880
What about the secret, you guys?

1929
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,740
I wasted too much trouble on it and it's not completable.

1930
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:13,460
Wait, what do you... Oh!

1931
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:14,640
I can't complete...

1932
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:14,780
Oh!

1933
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:16,800
No!

1934
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:18,560
Really?

1935
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,040
Oh my gosh, I almost fell off.

1936
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,800
Minto falling off.

1937
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,260
Oh my god.

1938
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,980
Captain Pinscher!

1939
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:32,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1940
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:34,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1941
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:37,720
Wait, I just died?

1942
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:38,940
Wait, how did I just die?

1943
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:42,040
I thought it was a cutscene.

1944
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:56,210
That's so funny.

1945
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:01,990
Oh, I lost my rock.

1946
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:17,850
Okay.

1947
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:22,630
Yeah, it was too cinematic, for real.

1948
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:24,570
Wait, so...

1949
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:26,710
Oh, I guess I don't need that.

1950
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:35,810
Yeah, it does have a bit of a range.

1951
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:36,330
Yeah, right?

1952
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:50,320
Oh, okay, okay, I see now, I see.

1953
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:51,760
Oh!

1954
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:53,420
Okay, okay.

1955
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:15,980
Let's wait for it to come back down.

1956
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:23,640
What does that do?

1957
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:25,380
Oh, it allows me to climb.

1958
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,600
Gross.

1959
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:41,400
Whoa!

1960
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:46,020
Oh, close!

1961
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:54,420
I need to be faster, maybe.

1962
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:56,020
No!

1963
01:30:57,620 --> 01:30:58,460
Come here.

1964
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:02,980
So close.

1965
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,320
Oh, dang it, I threw it too far.

1966
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:14,760
Oh, I'm throwing these all in the worst spots.

1967
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:28,170
Oh!

1968
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:29,090
Oh, he's juggling!

1969
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:31,610
They respawn, it's okay, it's okay.

1970
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:38,790
He's so awesome.

1971
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:41,730
Oh, and they also disappear, so...

1972
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:43,410
That's fine.

1973
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:45,650
Oh,

1974
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:01,260
I missed it.

1975
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:03,900
There we go.

1976
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:10,960
Use the Stinger, my souls!

1977
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:14,140
Okay.

1978
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,060
Whee!

1979
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:21,340
Jump up on the Hydra's back!

1980
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,460
Jump up on the Hydra's back!

1981
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,520
Jump up on the Hydra's back!

1982
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:29,340
Jump up on the Hydra's back!

1983
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:29,920
Oh my gosh.

1984
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:32,800
How am I supposed to...

1985
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:34,120
time this?

1986
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:34,780
Oh my gosh.

1987
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:35,900
Hmm?

1988
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:37,060
Okay.

1989
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:40,080
Yeah!

1990
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:40,760
Yeah!

1991
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:41,140
Yeah!

1992
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:41,620
Yeah!

1993
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:42,040
Yeah!

1994
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:42,420
Yeah!

1995
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:43,560
Nice!

1996
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,080
Uh...

1997
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:51,100
Jump up on the Hydra's back!

1998
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,040
Jump up on the Hydra's back!

1999
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:55,160
Jump up on the Hydra's back!

2000
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,200
Where do I kill him?

2001
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,660
Oh, I...

2002
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:00,980
The

2003
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:09,570
PTSD from that.

2004
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:10,170
Sorry.

2005
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:12,490
I was having a moment with it.

2006
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:13,650
Oh, no!

2007
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:16,750
Nice.

2008
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:20,770
Yeah, I literally beheaded him, yeah.

2009
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:22,450
Kind of hardcore.

2010
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:23,330
Wow!

2011
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:24,070
So many bananas!

2012
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:33,980
Oh.

2013
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:35,420
We can kill a guy.

2014
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:35,920
Ah!

2015
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,240
Yippee!

2016
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:41,740
Wait, what if... No, there wouldn't be another puzzle piece.

2017
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:42,480
Probably.

2018
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,860
We know which one that I'm missing.

2019
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:45,740
We know which one I'm missing.

2020
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:48,940
Nice!

2021
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:50,940
Nice!

2022
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,900
If I... Okay, I have a question for anybody who's played this.

2023
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:59,320
If I go back in and get that puzzle piece at the very beginning and then leave, will it be okay?

2024
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:00,560
Can I do that?

2025
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:02,280
Grab it and exit the level?

2026
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:02,800
Yeah, right?

2027
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,280
I should be able to do that, right?

2028
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:05,460
Minto wins!

2029
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:08,340
Okay, let's try it.

2030
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:11,940
Okay.

2031
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:19,320
Where's that?

2032
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:20,260
Where's that dang bird?

2033
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:23,000
Yeah,

2034
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:30,040
but the secret...

2035
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,420
We can't even do the secret yet.

2036
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,060
I don't think it's unlockable, apparently.

2037
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,040
Yet so...

2038
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:38,500
I will... What if I crash?

2039
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:41,240
Ah!

2040
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:42,920
Why can't I go any further?

2041
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,480
Maybe I... Okay, hold on.

2042
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,740
I think I have to reach him.

2043
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:47,920
I have to get him on the right side.

2044
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:50,480
Oh, you can after the boss!

2045
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:54,480
Oh...

2046
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:56,460
Wait, so...

2047
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:58,200
Do I have to redo the boss again?

2048
01:34:58,420 --> 01:34:59,500
Or can I do it now?

2049
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:00,820
Oh my gosh, wait!

2050
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,800
How do I...

2051
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:04,320
Oh, boost!

2052
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,100
Okay, let's try again.

2053
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,240
You have to redo the boss.

2054
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:11,760
Well, it wasn't that hard.

2055
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,000
Ah, I didn't realize that it was only after the boss.

2056
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:29,320
Oh, what's this?

2057
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:47,080
Bird.

2058
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,220
Sorry, I didn't specify.

2059
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:51,500
I didn't want to be too specific.

2060
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,000
It's okay, I'm not mad at all.

2061
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:53,620
Don't worry about it.

2062
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:01,540
It's a guide for miss... Oh.

2063
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:04,280
We got all of them.

2064
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:12,600
I didn't really...

2065
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:13,840
I didn't remember what it was.

2066
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:16,460
Let's go here to the trunk of fog.

2067
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:18,760
You know what?

2068
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:19,340
Let's just leave.

2069
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:22,100
Let's just rip me, man.

2070
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:23,180
It's okay.

2071
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:26,320
I'm not even a little bit mad.

2072
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:28,000
Whoa...

2073
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:31,660
Whoa!

2074
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,340
Wait, wait, wait!

2075
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:33,940
Nice!

2076
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:36,640
And...

2077
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,020
Turkey!

2078
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:40,540
Oh my gosh, a little mole.

2079
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:46,930
He looks so stupid.

2080
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:52,330
He was camping me?

2081
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:52,850
For real?

2082
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:54,730
Oh my god.

2083
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:56,590
There we go.

2084
01:36:57,410 --> 01:36:58,090
Oh!

2085
01:36:58,530 --> 01:37:00,070
They snipe hard.

2086
01:37:03,370 --> 01:37:04,590
Yeah, take that.

2087
01:37:05,970 --> 01:37:07,590
This guy is incognito.

2088
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:11,710
He's so funny looking.

2089
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:28,910
Oh my gosh.

2090
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:31,750
I just like pulled out his insides from his butt.

2091
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:42,540
This area is so cute.

2092
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:43,820
It's so chill.

2093
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,720
Oh my gosh.

2094
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:49,960
Oh.

2095
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:50,200
Whoops.

2096
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:54,500
Oh.

2097
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:55,420
Oh!

2098
01:37:57,850 --> 01:37:59,310
Oh, these things are ugly.

2099
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:01,110
Hahaha.

2100
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:02,430
It's okay.

2101
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:02,750
Excuse me!

2102
01:38:04,610 --> 01:38:05,310
Oh!

2103
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:07,910
How do

2104
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,320
I stop you from being ugly?

2105
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:15,400
Yeah!

2106
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:17,140
Ah!

2107
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:17,860
Ah!

2108
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:18,860
Oh my gosh.

2109
01:38:21,490 --> 01:38:22,040
There we go.

2110
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:24,160
Angry flower.

2111
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:27,800
Oh my god, that tree is talking.

2112
01:38:28,180 --> 01:38:28,880
Hahaha.

2113
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,020
Just to himself.

2114
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:39,840
Talking tree.

2115
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,560
This place is kind of weird.

2116
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:41,860
Wow!

2117
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:45,140
That's a lot of nuts.

2118
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:47,540
This place is kind of crazy.

2119
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:47,880
Oh!

2120
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,400
Oh my gosh, you're slaves.

2121
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,660
They're bringing you water.

2122
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:58,140
These little ants.

2123
01:38:58,660 --> 01:38:59,080
Hey!

2124
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:00,420
Get back in line.

2125
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:03,820
Uh oh.

2126
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,140
There's a traffic jam, you guys.

2127
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:06,120
Hahaha.

2128
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:09,820
There's a traffic jam.

2129
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:12,400
He's so sad.

2130
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:16,040
Cows and deer and everything.

2131
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:18,660
Steak.

2132
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:21,860
Mint, why?

2133
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:23,180
I don't know.

2134
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:24,260
Hahaha.

2135
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:27,000
Look, they're back to normal.

2136
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:27,560
It's fine.

2137
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:28,060
Mostly.

2138
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,800
Oh, I got it.

2139
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:34,060
I got them all in one go.

2140
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:35,380
And I'm so good.

2141
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:38,600
What's this do?

2142
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:41,020
Oh!

2143
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:41,280
Oh!

2144
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:41,980
Oh!

2145
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:43,980
Oh my gosh, open up!

2146
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:46,680
Open up!

2147
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:47,240
Open up!

2148
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,300
Does this thing jump up into my mouth?

2149
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:29,010
I didn't know I was playing a horror game.

2150
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:30,530
I'm legit...

2151
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:31,490
I'm sad.

2152
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:33,290
I wasn't...

2153
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:35,130
Oh no, no, no, no, I don't wanna...

2154
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:35,970
Oh no!

2155
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:38,470
Oh god, get me away from him!

2156
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:40,310
I don't wanna look at this tree any longer.

2157
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:42,510
Oh my god, the camera angle is like...

2158
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:43,790
forcing me to look at him.

2159
01:40:45,470 --> 01:40:45,910
Oh!

2160
01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:46,950
We can play golf!

2161
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:48,770
Oh, oh, oh.

2162
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:50,930
Oh!

2163
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:51,830
So close.

2164
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:52,210
Okay.

2165
01:40:52,490 --> 01:40:53,630
Like this, like this.

2166
01:40:54,690 --> 01:40:55,530
Oh, just kidding.

2167
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:56,510
Oh, oh, oh.

2168
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,140
The Deku Tree was always into war.

2169
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:07,740
I don't like that.

2170
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:13,420
Okay, scoot over a little bit.

2171
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:15,020
The tree is cute!

2172
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:16,960
I don't... I'm terrified.

2173
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:18,960
Oh.

2174
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:27,500
But sometimes I use my right hand, and sometimes I use my left hand.

2175
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:28,520
Let's try.

2176
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:30,580
Oh my god.

2177
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:32,760
Robot.

2178
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:35,080
Oh!

2179
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,280
Oh, so close!

2180
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:38,240
Oh, oh, oh.

2181
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:40,080
Oh, oh, oh.

2182
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,120
Oh, oh, oh.

2183
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:43,760
Oh, oh.

2184
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:45,920
Oh, oh, oh.

2185
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:49,100
I should have waited to do this part.

2186
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:50,800
I had no idea what was gonna happen.

2187
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:52,680
It's the Carni...

2188
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,160
Carniferous Tree from Mortal Kombat.

2189
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:56,660
Wow.

2190
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:58,560
They have everyone in this game.

2191
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:12,680
Oh, oh, oh.

2192
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:14,580
Oh, oh, oh.

2193
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:15,780
Oh, oh, oh.

2194
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:16,760
Who is that over there?

2195
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:18,360
Oh, oh, oh.

2196
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:20,240
Oh, oh, oh.

2197
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:22,080
Oh, oh, oh.

2198
01:42:22,740 --> 01:42:23,500
I got you.

2199
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:26,060
I got you.

2200
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:28,620
Brave biker.

2201
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,320
Better a one percenter than a freaker.

2202
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:34,340
What's wrong with being a freaker?

2203
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:36,000
What do you mean by that?

2204
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:47,770
Day is gone.

2205
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:49,250
Isn't that a zombie?

2206
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:06,680
Can I get his butt?

2207
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:08,480
Maybe not.

2208
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:11,020
Unless I'm just bad.

2209
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:12,480
How do I bait him out?

2210
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:15,180
There we go.

2211
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,220
Okay, just kidding.

2212
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:21,300
Apples, apples.

2213
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:23,120
Apples, apples.

2214
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:24,880
Oh my god, the sheep are so cute.

2215
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:26,940
Oh, oh, oh.

2216
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:28,780
Oh, oh, oh.

2217
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:30,780
Oh, oh, oh.

2218
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:32,620
Oh, oh, oh.

2219
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:35,860
Zombie games love making up another word for zombie.

2220
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,540
They really do, don't they?

2221
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,180
Oh, oh, oh.

2222
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:41,420
You think any of you guys died from the tree growing?

2223
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:43,960
Oh, oh, oh.

2224
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:45,900
Oh, oh, oh.

2225
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:47,880
Oh, oh, oh.

2226
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:49,860
Oh, oh, oh.

2227
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:51,720
Oh, oh, oh.

2228
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:53,840
Oh, oh, oh.

2229
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:55,500
Oh, oh, oh.

2230
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:56,120
Oh, oh, oh.

2231
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:58,540
Because zombie is too cliche, you guys.

2232
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:00,200
You gotta say like...

2233
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:01,920
It's crazy.

2234
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:03,720
Mind.

2235
01:44:07,530 --> 01:44:09,710
So we're really gonna go into this guy's mouth?

2236
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:10,490
Or...

2237
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:13,530
Oh my god, I'm so scared right now.

2238
01:44:14,170 --> 01:44:15,230
And I'm so...

2239
01:44:15,230 --> 01:44:15,770
Look at him.

2240
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:17,050
He's literally...

2241
01:44:17,050 --> 01:44:20,250
He is losing himself over this guy.

2242
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:21,470
He's like, this tree!

2243
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:23,290
Oh my gosh, tree!

2244
01:44:24,990 --> 01:44:28,150
This is robot's time of his life!

2245
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:39,860
We got an elephant!

2246
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:41,660
I think.

2247
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:47,540
That's something.

2248
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:49,100
I can't tell.

2249
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:52,140
Oh!

2250
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:54,800
Uh...

2251
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:55,680
So...

2252
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:57,260
Wait, what?

2253
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:00,680
Oh!

2254
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:03,500
Create extra platforms.

2255
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:05,180
What?

2256
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:06,600
Oh, this is a bad guy.

2257
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,280
Does it...

2258
01:45:11,050 --> 01:45:11,880
Does it like...

2259
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:14,640
Use up stuff too?

2260
01:45:14,980 --> 01:45:15,280
Or...

2261
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:19,080
Like if I use up all the goops...

2262
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:20,220
Like, or...

2263
01:45:24,010 --> 01:45:25,050
Did I get all of it?

2264
01:45:25,090 --> 01:45:25,810
Actually, I can't tell.

2265
01:45:26,030 --> 01:45:26,610
Yes, I did.

2266
01:45:27,370 --> 01:45:28,190
Cuz I'm a gamer.

2267
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:38,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2268
01:45:39,730 --> 01:45:42,290
Wow, this one's actually so fun!

2269
01:45:42,530 --> 01:45:43,110
Three charges.

2270
01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:44,070
Okay, got it, got it.

2271
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,260
He's freaking me out, you guys.

2272
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:01,660
Can't get me from up here.

2273
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:02,060
Ow!

2274
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:03,300
He can get me from up there!

2275
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:10,010
Okay.

2276
01:46:10,770 --> 01:46:11,130
Okay.

2277
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:26,800
Oh shit.

2278
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:27,940
Classic.

2279
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:30,460
Okay.

2280
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:32,540
I didn't think I could make it.

2281
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:35,160
And that's why I had made the other platform earlier.

2282
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:36,100
But...

2283
01:46:57,420 --> 01:46:58,580
Oh my gosh.

2284
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:00,540
I'm like not talking much.

2285
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:01,860
Because I'm like so concentrated.

2286
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:02,440
You know?

2287
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:05,880
I'm concentrating so much.

2288
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:08,660
Maybe it would be safer to go...

2289
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:10,160
Back this way.

2290
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:12,740
Okay.

2291
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:15,900
And then I guess these have a time limit as well?

2292
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:18,060
The little...

2293
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:19,560
Little patches that I make?

2294
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:20,740
Oh my gosh.

2295
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:24,040
Okay, good thing there's a...

2296
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:25,580
Checkpoint here.

2297
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:30,000
Jack be nimble!

2298
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:31,540
Jack be quick!

2299
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,260
Ah!

2300
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:35,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2301
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:40,410
Oi!

2302
01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:42,050
Yeah, nice!

2303
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:45,950
Nice!

2304
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:46,710
Nice!

2305
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:49,130
Oh, I can see that guy coming...

2306
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:50,210
From a mile away!

2307
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:52,730
Wait.

2308
01:47:53,570 --> 01:47:55,330
Oh, I guess there's nothing that way.

2309
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:56,390
I noticed like...

2310
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:58,250
It looks like there's a little path of leaves, you know?

2311
01:47:59,250 --> 01:47:59,690
Ow!

2312
01:47:59,930 --> 01:48:02,150
Oh my gosh, he's charging at me!

2313
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:06,650
This tree...

2314
01:48:06,650 --> 01:48:08,550
I'm also like listening to the tree singing.

2315
01:48:09,170 --> 01:48:09,790
He's got bars.

2316
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:11,470
Oh!

2317
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:12,010
Oh,

2318
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:17,860
uh...

2319
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:18,340
No, no, no, no!

2320
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:19,220
I gotta goop him up!

2321
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:21,340
There we go.

2322
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,320
I gotta goop him up!

2323
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:26,920
This tree is spittin'.

2324
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:29,220
This level is so fun!

2325
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:30,280
Oh my gosh!

2326
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:33,020
It's so funky!

2327
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:34,060
I love it!

2328
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,440
I mean, this whole game is so funky, but...

2329
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:39,600
I mean, this whole game is so funky, but...

2330
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:40,180
Yeah!

2331
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:40,380
Yeah!

2332
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:52,400
That's so cute!

2333
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:53,400
Oh my gosh.

2334
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:54,720
Oh, hello.

2335
01:48:58,630 --> 01:49:00,930
Ew, everything is so smiley.

2336
01:49:01,810 --> 01:49:04,130
I think you didn't want to jump into his mouth.

2337
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:05,230
I mean...

2338
01:49:07,290 --> 01:49:07,930
You're right.

2339
01:49:08,930 --> 01:49:10,150
Oh, Angry Birds.

2340
01:49:13,270 --> 01:49:13,850
Ah!

2341
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:23,380
Come here.

2342
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:29,880
Collateral damage.

2343
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:34,640
Scoop!

2344
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:40,180
I just robbed that family.

2345
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:41,620
Of all their riches.

2346
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,180
Everybody's so happy!

2347
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:46,780
What is...

2348
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:47,740
What is...

2349
01:49:47,740 --> 01:49:49,660
What is this?

2350
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:52,460
This thing...

2351
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:54,360
This level is very freaky.

2352
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:58,060
No wonder we found that freaky guy here.

2353
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,680
Oh, there's more up here even.

2354
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:01,880
Oh, I almost missed it.

2355
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:04,000
I almost missed it.

2356
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:10,840
Nice.

2357
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:13,360
Nice.

2358
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:18,400
Bleepy!

2359
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:20,000
Got a guy!

2360
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:23,440
Nice, nice, nice.

2361
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:25,460
I wonder who the other character is.

2362
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:26,680
Maybe he's also from that...

2363
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:27,460
Zombie game?

2364
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:34,060
That's a lot of nuts!

2365
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:36,820
How do I get up here?

2366
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:37,440
Okay, hold on.

2367
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:37,520
Come on.

2368
01:50:44,530 --> 01:50:45,830
We did it!

2369
01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:48,430
Oh my gosh, even like the...

2370
01:50:48,430 --> 01:50:51,190
Look, the indent from the balloon.

2371
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:54,010
Wow.

2372
01:50:54,350 --> 01:50:55,770
Such attention to detail.

2373
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:01,700
Smileys!

2374
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:06,180
Smileys!

2375
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:07,780
Alright, here we go.

2376
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:08,620
Let's keep going.

2377
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:12,440
Okay, three more.

2378
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:17,080
Wow!

2379
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:18,120
Oh my gosh!

2380
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:21,700
Ah!

2381
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:26,280
Oh my gosh.

2382
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,920
I'm so bad at this.

2383
01:51:31,870 --> 01:51:32,510
There we go.

2384
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:43,320
Now I wait.

2385
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:48,470
Oh, that was so close.

2386
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:49,630
That was so close.

2387
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:53,790
Woo!

2388
01:51:56,650 --> 01:51:57,890
Oh gosh, little poops.

2389
01:51:57,970 --> 01:51:58,770
What are these things?

2390
01:51:59,310 --> 01:51:59,770
Oh.

2391
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:02,790
There we go.

2392
01:52:06,050 --> 01:52:07,310
These guys are new.

2393
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:07,730
Oh!

2394
01:52:09,370 --> 01:52:10,190
Is he bad?

2395
01:52:11,590 --> 01:52:12,050
Bad.

2396
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:16,260
But he has hard eyes.

2397
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:17,980
Vankobra!

2398
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:19,060
Welcome to the membership.

2399
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:19,580
Thank you!

2400
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:24,120
I don't think I can...

2401
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:24,900
Oh!

2402
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:29,680
What do I do with these guys?

2403
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,380
Oh no, they're platforms.

2404
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:35,940
Oh no.

2405
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:37,960
He loves you.

2406
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:45,600
They do jump out on the beats.

2407
01:52:45,820 --> 01:52:46,980
It's a secret rhythm game.

2408
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:49,320
Yeah!

2409
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:52,500
Check behind if you miss anything.

2410
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:52,940
Did I?

2411
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:56,100
Oh.

2412
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:56,620
Oh.

2413
01:52:56,620 --> 01:52:56,740
Oh.

2414
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:00,660
Thank you.

2415
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:05,380
Oh.

2416
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:06,420
Oh,

2417
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:10,580
wait.

2418
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:11,780
It won't let me slurp him.

2419
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:13,620
Uh...

2420
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:16,520
There we go.

2421
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:26,160
It's...

2422
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:27,020
This one!

2423
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:28,920
It's always this one I feel.

2424
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:30,060
Oh my god!

2425
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:31,220
We found the other person!

2426
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:32,340
Yay!

2427
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:35,420
I missed a bot.

2428
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:38,320
Spirit God.

2429
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:39,580
Spirit God.

2430
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:41,440
You guys, I missed a bot!

2431
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:44,360
Helps anyone having trouble moving.

2432
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:46,760
Helps anyone having trouble moving.

2433
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:47,520
I'm not...

2434
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,280
I'm fine.

2435
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:49,600
Where am I?

2436
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:53,460
I don't need to move up.

2437
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:54,040
I don't need to move up.

2438
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,540
I'm really content.

2439
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:57,800
Here.

2440
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:02,620
I missed one!

2441
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:03,480
I missed one!

2442
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,780
Where did I miss him?

2443
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:09,120
But it's got...

2444
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:10,160
It's between...

2445
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:11,600
Here?

2446
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:13,580
Oh!

2447
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:15,100
Ah!

2448
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:22,780
I see.

2449
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:38,260
He's become...

2450
01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:41,740
Would you love me even if I was a worm?

2451
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:46,340
Would you love me even if I was a worm?

2452
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:47,340
Would you love me even if I was a worm?

2453
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:48,980
Oh no.

2454
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:50,700
It's putting me all the way back over here?

2455
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:52,100
Wait, this sucks.

2456
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:55,180
Wait, I already did this part.

2457
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:57,160
Don't make me do it again.

2458
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:01,020
I'll be a worm for you, girl.

2459
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:06,300
Nice.

2460
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:08,520
Okay.

2461
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:10,160
I'm learned.

2462
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:12,320
Okay,

2463
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:32,200
wait.

2464
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:33,560
How do I get these coins, though?

2465
01:55:34,900 --> 01:55:36,040
Wait, how do I get these coins, though?

2466
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:48,460
Oh my gosh, I thought I was going to die!

2467
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:50,480
Oh, I thought I was going to die!

2468
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:51,600
I'm having a rough day.

2469
01:55:51,700 --> 01:55:54,080
I'm glad you're streaming because your streams always make me so happy!

2470
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:56,040
I hope you're having fun playing.

2471
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:56,380
I am!

2472
01:55:57,340 --> 01:55:57,980
Thanks, Cyberfishing!

2473
01:55:58,040 --> 01:55:59,120
I'm sorry, I'm having a bad day.

2474
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:00,800
I hope it gets better.

2475
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:29,080
It would have sent me back to the last checkpoint.

2476
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:31,200
Yeah, but I would have lost the coins.

2477
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:57,100
Oh, so sweet!

2478
01:56:57,660 --> 01:56:58,920
What's going on in here?

2479
01:56:59,280 --> 01:56:59,880
Honeybee!

2480
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:00,460
Wow!

2481
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:04,380
The blazes are so cute!

2482
01:57:05,900 --> 01:57:07,140
Oh my gosh!

2483
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:10,540
The blazes are so cute!

2484
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:16,040
Blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze.

2485
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:19,200
Blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze!

2486
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:22,880
Why do some of these look kind of mysterious?

2487
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:26,280
Hmm...

2488
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:34,280
Oh, I have no more charge.

2489
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:35,220
Wait, hold on.

2490
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:36,100
Maybe I can go get some more?

2491
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:37,080
Oh wait, no.

2492
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:38,920
I would have to go all the way back down.

2493
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:39,480
Never mind.

2494
01:57:49,950 --> 01:57:51,510
So now we can suck up some honey.

2495
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:53,330
Hello?

2496
01:57:53,330 --> 01:57:53,930
I'll take that.

2497
01:57:53,990 --> 01:57:54,310
Thank you.

2498
01:57:54,930 --> 01:57:55,830
Can I hit the breeze?

2499
01:57:56,710 --> 01:57:57,530
Come here.

2500
01:57:58,890 --> 01:58:00,830
He's like, I'm trying to work here.

2501
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:03,150
Let me live my bee life.

2502
01:58:05,670 --> 01:58:06,270
Cute!

2503
01:58:08,010 --> 01:58:09,530
Oh, there's another one.

2504
01:58:10,790 --> 01:58:12,390
Oh, there's several of them.

2505
01:58:18,930 --> 01:58:19,530
Nice.

2506
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:22,370
Oh, shoot.

2507
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:30,530
This tree is like having his best... his best life.

2508
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:32,950
He was so thirsty.

2509
01:58:33,430 --> 01:58:35,750
And then he got to eat me.

2510
01:58:35,970 --> 01:58:36,210
Ah!

2511
01:58:36,870 --> 01:58:38,090
I'm such a genius!

2512
01:58:41,090 --> 01:58:44,570
And then he got to eat me and he's really happy about it.

2513
01:58:44,690 --> 01:58:45,650
What a freak.

2514
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:56,410
What am I supposed to do?

2515
01:58:57,910 --> 01:58:58,510
Oh!

2516
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:02,680
Oh, I can suck up the cubes!

2517
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:04,820
Ah!

2518
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:06,000
Oh, wait.

2519
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:10,980
Wait.

2520
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:14,600
He gave me a coin, so... definitely want that.

2521
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:20,560
Suck.

2522
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:22,440
Gamer Minto.

2523
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:23,440
Absolutely.

2524
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:25,840
Ah!

2525
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:27,320
Not this freak again!

2526
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:27,400
Yeah!

2527
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:33,160
Suck.

2528
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:33,380
Suck.

2529
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:33,800
Suck.

2530
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:35,160
Suck.

2531
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:35,500
Suck.

2532
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:37,160
Suck.

2533
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:37,500
Suck.

2534
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:38,980
Suck.

2535
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:39,300
Suck.

2536
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:41,080
Suck.

2537
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:41,700
Suck.

2538
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:42,760
Suck.

2539
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:43,300
Suck, suck, suck.

2540
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:46,940
Suck, suck, suck.

2541
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:51,220
Suck, suck, suck.

2542
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:09,880
Suck, suck, suck.

2543
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:31,480
What else could be up here though?

2544
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:34,200
I've gotten like everything in this... right?

2545
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:36,760
Oh, there's one more guy.

2546
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:37,220
Okay.

2547
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:52,860
Suck, suck, suck.

2548
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:54,980
Suck, suck, suck.

2549
02:00:58,560 --> 02:00:59,520
Okay, nice.

2550
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:00,060
Alright.

2551
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:00,960
Onwards.

2552
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:03,920
Assistant.

2553
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:08,580
I don't like this, I don't think.

2554
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:09,700
I don't think I like this.

2555
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:10,320
Wait.

2556
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:12,080
Why can't I just use the platforms?

2557
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:13,480
Why can't I...

2558
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:17,820
Why can't I just use the platforms?

2559
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:19,040
I'm so scared.

2560
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,100
I don't know how to jump.

2561
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:22,780
Wait.

2562
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:44,220
Suck, suck.

2563
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:47,300
Suck...

2564
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:49,520
Okay,

2565
02:02:23,890 --> 02:02:26,030
since I'm here, let's just chat, I guess.

2566
02:02:26,910 --> 02:02:28,290
I had no honey.

2567
02:02:32,070 --> 02:02:33,270
It didn't...

2568
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:35,130
It didn't count, it didn't count.

2569
02:02:36,310 --> 02:02:37,010
Okay, good.

2570
02:02:41,430 --> 02:02:42,370
Suck too hard.

2571
02:02:43,750 --> 02:02:46,730
Alright, so if we die, we gotta remember to come back here, you guys.

2572
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:52,530
Oh my god.

2573
02:02:53,330 --> 02:02:53,810
Wait.

2574
02:02:54,230 --> 02:02:54,950
Okay, nevermind.

2575
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:11,420
Why is this so hard for me?

2576
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:11,900
Yeah.

2577
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:17,900
This depth perception strikes again.

2578
02:03:29,130 --> 02:03:29,810
Okay.

2579
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:32,570
Right into him, I know.

2580
02:03:33,710 --> 02:03:34,770
I ran out of...

2581
02:03:34,770 --> 02:03:36,230
I ran out of super jumping.

2582
02:03:39,790 --> 02:03:40,470
There we

2583
02:03:48,850 --> 02:03:49,970
go.

2584
02:03:50,130 --> 02:03:50,590
Nice.

2585
02:03:52,850 --> 02:04:02,430
He says my jumping skills are great.

2586
02:04:02,430 --> 02:04:02,510
Wait.

2587
02:04:28,890 --> 02:04:30,250
This is the...

2588
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:31,490
This is the true boss.

2589
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:34,570
Okay.

2590
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:46,680
Let's go.

2591
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:48,020
Let's...

2592
02:04:49,970 --> 02:04:51,030
This is the...

2593
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:51,190
Ahh!

2594
02:05:10,990 --> 02:05:13,290
Mr. Depth Perception.

2595
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:14,510
I know!

2596
02:05:20,670 --> 02:05:22,650
My depth perception.

2597
02:05:29,590 --> 02:05:31,870
We love our Cyclops VTuber.

2598
02:05:32,090 --> 02:05:34,490
For all you know, I actually need an eyepatch.

2599
02:05:34,710 --> 02:05:36,610
I actually have an eyepatch on.

2600
02:05:36,890 --> 02:05:40,570
And you're making fun of somebody that has an eyepatch!

2601
02:05:58,060 --> 02:05:59,860
Yeah, and I do it again.

2602
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:01,180
You're so cruel!

2603
02:06:25,210 --> 02:06:26,850
I'm facing the wrong direction.

2604
02:06:27,190 --> 02:06:29,630
Wait, I'm facing the wrong way!

2605
02:06:32,010 --> 02:06:33,930
I'm facing the wrong way!

2606
02:06:37,350 --> 02:06:37,990
Checkpoint!

2607
02:07:05,090 --> 02:07:05,730
Delicious!

2608
02:07:08,730 --> 02:07:10,330
Settle the score.

2609
02:07:14,330 --> 02:07:15,810
What is this?

2610
02:07:15,970 --> 02:07:17,730
He's got a big old seam down his back.

2611
02:07:25,350 --> 02:07:26,150
No, he don't.

2612
02:07:26,150 --> 02:07:27,370
Oh, that's a lot of nuts!

2613
02:07:28,350 --> 02:07:29,110
What's in here?

2614
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:34,770
Oh my gosh!

2615
02:07:35,570 --> 02:07:36,050
Oh!

2616
02:07:38,070 --> 02:07:38,550
Whoa!

2617
02:07:38,850 --> 02:07:46,770
Oh my gosh, that was close.

2618
02:07:49,250 --> 02:07:50,150
I got him!

2619
02:07:51,370 --> 02:07:52,650
I got the last man!

2620
02:07:53,490 --> 02:07:53,970
Yippee!

2621
02:07:54,470 --> 02:07:54,890
Yeah!

2622
02:07:55,990 --> 02:07:57,450
That camo looks familiar.

2623
02:08:00,110 --> 02:08:02,170
Look at the little bears in here.

2624
02:08:02,330 --> 02:08:03,190
Oh, and they're gone!

2625
02:08:03,590 --> 02:08:06,250
Oh my gosh, this game actually is so kind.

2626
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:10,950
This game is actually so kind.

2627
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:18,260
Not a bot left behind.

2628
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:18,700
Nope.

2629
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:19,860
How many...

2630
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:22,080
Oh, and I got all the puzzle pieces.

2631
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:23,820
So this world is cleared, baby.

2632
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:27,640
Oh my gosh, I'm scared of this part.

2633
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:35,860
The coin!

2634
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:43,300
Tamatrio!

2635
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:45,360
Oh shoot!

2636
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:07,720
Okay, okay, I gotta get closer.

2637
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:18,040
Oh, shoot.

2638
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:19,740
I meant to hold it.

2639
02:09:23,950 --> 02:09:25,670
This music is so fun!

2640
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:36,840
Oh my god!

2641
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:45,060
Oh my god!

2642
02:09:45,060 --> 02:09:45,840
I'm scrambling!

2643
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:46,480
It's inside!

2644
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:48,400
I'm scrambling!

2645
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:49,060
It's inside!

2646
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,160
Oh, suck!

2647
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:54,360
Oh my god!

2648
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:56,400
Oh my god!

2649
02:10:05,350 --> 02:10:06,790
I didn't jump fast enough.

2650
02:10:08,830 --> 02:10:10,530
That was violent, right?

2651
02:10:10,850 --> 02:10:12,570
Yeah, that was pretty gross.

2652
02:10:23,430 --> 02:10:24,710
The timing.

2653
02:10:25,790 --> 02:10:27,250
Lobotomize the poor egg.

2654
02:10:30,070 --> 02:10:32,770
Timing on this is tricky for me.

2655
02:10:34,150 --> 02:10:35,530
Oh my gosh!

2656
02:10:38,730 --> 02:10:39,490
It's okay.

2657
02:10:39,750 --> 02:10:45,510
I don't think I... I wouldn't call them poor birds because they're actually quite gross.

2658
02:10:47,610 --> 02:10:48,790
I pressed X!

2659
02:10:48,850 --> 02:10:49,750
I held it!

2660
02:10:49,890 --> 02:10:51,170
I held X!

2661
02:11:07,150 --> 02:11:07,930
Oh my gosh!

2662
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:10,390
This part is so gross!

2663
02:11:14,470 --> 02:11:17,510
Okay, now here's where it gets real hard.

2664
02:11:19,550 --> 02:11:20,570
Oh my gosh!

2665
02:11:20,810 --> 02:11:22,950
There's no save spots anymore either.

2666
02:11:23,990 --> 02:11:24,670
What?

2667
02:11:24,690 --> 02:11:25,110
What?

2668
02:11:25,110 --> 02:11:25,310
What?

2669
02:11:26,110 --> 02:11:26,750
Yeah!

2670
02:11:27,170 --> 02:11:27,810
Timing!

2671
02:11:33,700 --> 02:11:34,340
Nice!

2672
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:40,220
It sucked!

2673
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:43,520
Oh my god!

2674
02:11:54,230 --> 02:11:55,030
There we go!

2675
02:11:55,390 --> 02:11:56,210
Got him!

2676
02:11:58,580 --> 02:11:59,400
Oh, the apples!

2677
02:12:05,890 --> 02:12:11,250
Is there anything special around here?

2678
02:12:11,290 --> 02:12:11,630
Maybe not.

2679
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:17,480
Hahaha!

2680
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:21,140
Oh, we just... We killed the family!

2681
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:33,100
It's a lot of apples.

2682
02:12:33,660 --> 02:12:35,000
Where'd they all come from?

2683
02:12:35,260 --> 02:12:38,720
And we should have that place full complete.

2684
02:12:41,160 --> 02:12:41,480
Yeah!

2685
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:44,160
Nice.

2686
02:12:44,600 --> 02:12:45,260
What's that?

2687
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:47,180
No, no, no.

2688
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:48,160
You.

2689
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:48,960
What's you?

2690
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,500
There's a little world.

2691
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:50,500
Oh!

2692
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:52,720
Special little world?

2693
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:54,060
It's retro.

2694
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:56,320
I don't think I went to the Retro Rampage 1!

2695
02:12:56,600 --> 02:12:57,700
Should we go try it out?

2696
02:12:59,200 --> 02:12:59,920
How do I...?

2697
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:00,240
Go back.

2698
02:13:04,590 --> 02:13:05,030
Retro Rampage 1.

2699
02:13:05,030 --> 02:13:06,510
I plan on super chatting about something else.

2700
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:08,110
Building a Metal Gear Gunpla with K-Sun.

2701
02:13:08,530 --> 02:13:11,350
Just to clarify, Dismint really only have one eye.

2702
02:13:12,290 --> 02:13:12,730
Retro Rampage 1.

2703
02:13:12,730 --> 02:13:12,750
Retro Rampage 1.

2704
02:13:14,650 --> 02:13:15,090
What?

2705
02:13:16,170 --> 02:13:17,170
Retro Rampage 1.

2706
02:13:19,390 --> 02:13:19,830
What?

2707
02:13:20,510 --> 02:13:20,950
Retro Rampage 1.

2708
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:32,880
Retro Rampage 1.

2709
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:33,000
Retro Rampage 1.

2710
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:36,500
So... oh yes, I wanted to go to this one because I think there might be Katamari here, right?

2711
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:40,100
Just try to be careful of rules and stuff, you know?

2712
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:42,600
Regarding mentioning other people.

2713
02:13:43,900 --> 02:13:45,100
Unless I bring them up first.

2714
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:48,520
Hello?

2715
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:51,420
Oh my god!

2716
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:53,240
Wait, what?

2717
02:14:04,180 --> 02:14:04,880
Here we go!

2718
02:14:06,700 --> 02:14:07,140
Okay.

2719
02:14:09,740 --> 02:14:12,020
Oh, why am I going against it?

2720
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:15,540
Oh my gosh, this is why we're rolling!

2721
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:18,040
This is so fun!

2722
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:21,200
It's fun until...

2723
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:23,740
Okay, don't bump into those guys.

2724
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:26,740
Don't bump into those guys, everybody.

2725
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:30,520
I always had a good run too.

2726
02:14:35,790 --> 02:14:36,910
Okay, let them come to me.

2727
02:14:38,870 --> 02:14:39,870
Oh my gosh.

2728
02:14:42,190 --> 02:14:42,690
What?

2729
02:14:43,030 --> 02:14:43,530
Okay.

2730
02:14:43,950 --> 02:14:44,450
What?

2731
02:14:51,500 --> 02:14:52,000
Nice.

2732
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:53,640
Come here.

2733
02:14:54,020 --> 02:14:54,520
Yeah.

2734
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:55,380
Nice.

2735
02:14:57,420 --> 02:14:58,860
I'm... I'm living... I'm...

2736
02:14:59,980 --> 02:15:01,120
This is my calling.

2737
02:15:02,540 --> 02:15:04,040
This is my calling, everybody.

2738
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:08,440
This is my calling!

2739
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:11,580
Yes!

2740
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:17,080
Clank ASMR.

2741
02:15:18,780 --> 02:15:19,620
Who is that?

2742
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:21,260
Actually, who is it?

2743
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:21,760
Oh.

2744
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:25,380
Wait!

2745
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:26,200
Oh!

2746
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:27,160
It's a...

2747
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:29,360
It's a cat!

2748
02:15:29,620 --> 02:15:29,840
Wait!

2749
02:15:29,860 --> 02:15:30,080
Oh!

2750
02:15:30,180 --> 02:15:30,860
What's his name?

2751
02:15:31,060 --> 02:15:31,380
Oh!

2752
02:15:33,140 --> 02:15:33,580
Oh!

2753
02:15:33,820 --> 02:15:34,080
Oh!

2754
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:35,580
Shiro!

2755
02:15:36,460 --> 02:15:36,900
Toro!

2756
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:37,200
Shiro!

2757
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:37,480
Yeah!

2758
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:37,720
Yeah!

2759
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:37,880
Yeah!

2760
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:39,460
Yes!

2761
02:15:39,620 --> 02:15:39,840
Yes!

2762
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:40,060
Yes!

2763
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:40,720
Oh my gosh.

2764
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:41,560
Aspirant.

2765
02:15:41,560 --> 02:15:42,100
Operational cat.

2766
02:15:42,340 --> 02:15:43,640
To purr is human.

2767
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:45,320
He is so cute!

2768
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:46,960
Is that...

2769
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:47,820
Is that all that's there?

2770
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:50,600
Okay.

2771
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:52,580
Off we go!

2772
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,140
That was so easy.

2773
02:15:56,940 --> 02:15:57,860
That was fun though.

2774
02:15:58,780 --> 02:15:59,500
I thought...

2775
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:00,640
I thought 100%.

2776
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:02,140
It would be Katamari.

2777
02:16:02,340 --> 02:16:02,720
Sorry.

2778
02:16:02,740 --> 02:16:03,520
We'll be better in the future.

2779
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:04,120
No worries.

2780
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:04,700
Thank you.

2781
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:06,320
Thanks for apologizing.

2782
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:07,060
I appreciate it.

2783
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:07,700
You didn't have to.

2784
02:16:07,880 --> 02:16:08,560
But I...

2785
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:10,380
I accept your apology.

2786
02:16:10,780 --> 02:16:11,260
Sorry.

2787
02:16:11,260 --> 02:16:11,540
Sorry.

2788
02:16:11,560 --> 02:16:12,700
Not that I was angry or anything.

2789
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,080
Just wanted to kind of...

2790
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:15,660
Bring that up again.

2791
02:16:15,820 --> 02:16:17,900
Because you know sometimes people get excited in Minecraft!

2792
02:16:26,340 --> 02:16:29,380
Is this what you guys are going to do to me when you get a little Lego...

2793
02:16:29,960 --> 02:16:30,760
Lego Minto?

2794
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:36,080
Block game!

2795
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:37,140
Block block game!

2796
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:44,860
I want to destroy everything.

2797
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:46,160
Oh my gosh.

2798
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:46,760
It's so...

2799
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:47,060
Guys.

2800
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:48,500
Guys.

2801
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:49,260
This is...

2802
02:16:49,260 --> 02:16:49,560
This is...

2803
02:16:49,580 --> 02:16:51,500
It's so satisfying.

2804
02:16:52,370 --> 02:16:54,720
This is actually so satisfying.

2805
02:16:59,160 --> 02:16:59,630
Oh.

2806
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:08,920
Oh!

2807
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:10,200
It's so satisfying.

2808
02:17:10,860 --> 02:17:12,240
Oh my god!

2809
02:17:15,780 --> 02:17:17,060
Is that...

2810
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:22,380
Discipline warrior.

2811
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:27,820
Really?

2812
02:17:28,020 --> 02:17:28,480
Was I right?

2813
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:31,660
You must defeat me.

2814
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:43,200
What if we go upside down?

2815
02:17:43,320 --> 02:17:44,040
Okay, we can't.

2816
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,480
We took out a tree in the process?

2817
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:58,640
Okay, we're grabbing some of these little bits while we're...

2818
02:17:59,440 --> 02:18:00,720
These areas, though.

2819
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:01,480
How mysterious.

2820
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:03,560
How mysterious.

2821
02:18:03,820 --> 02:18:04,620
What are we missing here?

2822
02:18:05,360 --> 02:18:06,480
Oh, quite a bit.

2823
02:18:06,620 --> 02:18:07,080
Puzzle piece.

2824
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:08,080
Puzzle piece and a warp?

2825
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:08,620
Okay.

2826
02:18:10,620 --> 02:18:11,540
What's this one?

2827
02:18:12,760 --> 02:18:13,960
Crumble ramble!

2828
02:18:14,220 --> 02:18:15,260
Let's try it out.

2829
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:21,200
Raw you, as boomers say.

2830
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,440
Crumble ramble.

2831
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:25,660
What is this one now?

2832
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:28,560
Oh, shoot.

2833
02:18:29,220 --> 02:18:30,140
Oh my god.

2834
02:18:30,260 --> 02:18:31,340
Oh, this is...

2835
02:18:31,340 --> 02:18:34,600
Wait, this one is so...

2836
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:35,120
What?

2837
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:37,760
This one actually looks so much fun.

2838
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:38,620
It really is.

2839
02:18:39,580 --> 02:18:39,900
Oh.

2840
02:18:45,900 --> 02:18:47,540
What's that level from Fall Guys?

2841
02:18:52,710 --> 02:18:55,650
I'm trying not to waste as much of the board as I can.

2842
02:18:56,650 --> 02:18:57,250
You know?

2843
02:18:58,730 --> 02:18:59,210
I

2844
02:19:06,820 --> 02:19:08,540
don't know why this is getting me so bad now.

2845
02:19:11,780 --> 02:19:12,260
Oh.

2846
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:17,760
Oh, okay.

2847
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:18,740
We got him.

2848
02:19:23,550 --> 02:19:25,170
Monkey see, monkey rescue?

2849
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:27,290
Home run hero!

2850
02:19:27,690 --> 02:19:29,810
Never afraid to take a big swing.

2851
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:31,590
Oh, that was it?

2852
02:19:35,990 --> 02:19:36,470
So...

2853
02:19:36,950 --> 02:19:37,190
Okay.

2854
02:19:39,830 --> 02:19:41,230
That's not power pro, is it?

2855
02:19:41,390 --> 02:19:41,930
I don't think so.

2856
02:19:42,130 --> 02:19:42,850
MLB the show?

2857
02:19:43,590 --> 02:19:45,290
That doesn't seem like power pro.

2858
02:19:47,550 --> 02:19:48,030
Yeah.

2859
02:19:48,150 --> 02:19:48,610
Okay.

2860
02:19:48,670 --> 02:19:57,410
So, literally, besides these stars and then this monkey area, we're clear in this universe.

2861
02:19:59,730 --> 02:20:00,210
Cool.

2862
02:20:01,210 --> 02:20:02,010
Baseball man.

2863
02:20:05,230 --> 02:20:07,650
After I do this... this one?

2864
02:20:08,370 --> 02:20:09,350
This retro?

2865
02:20:10,230 --> 02:20:11,430
I want to...

2866
02:20:11,430 --> 02:20:11,750
Wow!

2867
02:20:13,690 --> 02:20:15,450
I want to do more gacha.

2868
02:20:16,150 --> 02:20:16,770
Wow!

2869
02:20:26,730 --> 02:20:27,710
Oh my god.

2870
02:20:28,870 --> 02:20:31,050
Minecraft, my favorite retro game ever.

2871
02:20:49,930 --> 02:20:50,800
They ambushed me!

2872
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:55,960
Wait, this is kind of freaky.

2873
02:20:56,120 --> 02:20:57,460
Wait, this is actually really...

2874
02:20:57,460 --> 02:20:58,880
What the hell?

2875
02:20:59,260 --> 02:20:59,860
Woah!

2876
02:21:02,860 --> 02:21:04,700
He, like, becomes the rabbit.

2877
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:06,720
Interesting.

2878
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:08,780
What if I do this?

2879
02:21:12,140 --> 02:21:13,880
What if I kill the rabbits first?

2880
02:21:16,480 --> 02:21:17,080
Ah!

2881
02:21:17,180 --> 02:21:17,540
Shoot!

2882
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:22,000
Oh, he still becomes the metal... the metal rabbit!

2883
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:23,580
You see that?

2884
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:34,120
Whoa!

2885
02:21:34,260 --> 02:21:34,860
I don't know what I'm doing here.

2886
02:21:34,860 --> 02:21:36,520
I gotta watch out for the shadows.

2887
02:21:38,700 --> 02:21:39,320
Destroy!

2888
02:22:01,320 --> 02:22:02,440
The blocks!

2889
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:06,780
Oh my god, I have more Street Fighter!

2890
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:11,400
Assured rival.

2891
02:22:11,740 --> 02:22:13,180
Attack him if you dare.

2892
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:15,580
Kenneth!

2893
02:22:15,580 --> 02:22:15,800
Kenneth!

2894
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:20,800
I keep destroying the tree.

2895
02:22:22,740 --> 02:22:23,680
It's Ken.

2896
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:30,180
What is this cheese world over here?

2897
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:34,140
Cheese to meet you.

2898
02:22:34,180 --> 02:22:35,260
Downsized surprise.

2899
02:22:36,220 --> 02:22:40,000
And then we have... Wormy Passage.

2900
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:43,340
Like I said, I wanna go back real quick.

2901
02:22:46,480 --> 02:22:48,000
Real... right fast.

2902
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:52,120
Do some more gacha a little bit, right?

2903
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:54,620
Gacha though.

2904
02:22:54,700 --> 02:22:55,860
Yeah, we're gonna do some more gacha.

2905
02:22:56,020 --> 02:22:59,180
I think we probably have enough coins to finish up this.

2906
02:23:00,020 --> 02:23:03,100
Why doesn't Amaterasu visit me at the... at the...

2907
02:23:04,140 --> 02:23:05,720
At the... at the gate?

2908
02:23:05,900 --> 02:23:06,920
It makes me so sad.

2909
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:08,220
Everybody else says hi to me.

2910
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:10,860
No!

2911
02:23:10,860 --> 02:23:11,620
Just four more!

2912
02:23:13,480 --> 02:23:14,960
Everybody to your positions!

2913
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:17,900
Amaterasu, why?

2914
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:19,320
And also this guy, either.

2915
02:23:21,240 --> 02:23:22,580
Why don't you visit me?

2916
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:23,360
Huh?

2917
02:23:27,880 --> 02:23:28,900
I'm so sorry.

2918
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:33,820
The little squeak!

2919
02:23:34,060 --> 02:23:35,920
Never played PlayStation growing up.

2920
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:36,860
Learning the culture.

2921
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:37,880
Yeah!

2922
02:23:39,940 --> 02:23:41,580
All this history, right?

2923
02:23:42,060 --> 02:23:44,480
The little... so sad.

2924
02:23:47,580 --> 02:23:48,020
Why?

2925
02:23:48,140 --> 02:23:49,120
I wanted to see what happened!

2926
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:50,740
Hey, guys.

2927
02:23:52,140 --> 02:23:53,220
I'm grabbing for ya.

2928
02:23:59,360 --> 02:24:00,220
I'm gonna get ya.

2929
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:01,420
I'm gonna get ya.

2930
02:24:01,540 --> 02:24:02,440
I'm tickling you.

2931
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:04,620
I'm tickling ya.

2932
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:10,540
Dog abuse.

2933
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:10,900
No!

2934
02:24:11,960 --> 02:24:13,660
We got a banana.

2935
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:14,700
Potassium pod.

2936
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:20,400
Oh my god, he's cheesing that he's got this banana.

2937
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:21,420
So good.

2938
02:24:23,640 --> 02:24:24,240
Watermelon!

2939
02:24:25,660 --> 02:24:26,260
Yummy.

2940
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:28,500
Something to share with a new friend.

2941
02:24:33,960 --> 02:24:34,900
Batter's boundary.

2942
02:24:35,260 --> 02:24:37,820
Needs a big swinger to step up to the plate.

2943
02:24:37,820 --> 02:24:38,740
Oh!

2944
02:24:38,860 --> 02:24:39,180
Oh!

2945
02:24:40,580 --> 02:24:41,300
He's old.

2946
02:24:41,400 --> 02:24:41,800
You get it?

2947
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:44,640
Oh.

2948
02:24:45,140 --> 02:24:46,480
Ape catcher!

2949
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:47,860
There's no escaping it.

2950
02:24:50,500 --> 02:24:52,740
The texture on this monkey.

2951
02:24:54,340 --> 02:24:55,060
Oh!

2952
02:24:55,400 --> 02:24:56,380
Wrapping cloth.

2953
02:24:56,840 --> 02:24:57,440
Ah!

2954
02:24:57,800 --> 02:24:58,980
It's so cute!

2955
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:01,260
The gift that keeps on giving.

2956
02:25:03,980 --> 02:25:04,700
And...

2957
02:25:04,700 --> 02:25:07,020
Shape-shifting...

2958
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:08,560
...staff.

2959
02:25:09,940 --> 02:25:10,980
Shape-shifting...

2960
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:13,020
...staff.

2961
02:25:13,960 --> 02:25:14,480
Shape...

2962
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:15,880
...shifting...

2963
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:17,320
...staff.

2964
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:20,400
For shepherds of restless spirits.

2965
02:25:22,780 --> 02:25:24,260
Oh wow, we can't clear it.

2966
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:25,180
Cookie bottles!

2967
02:25:25,640 --> 02:25:27,040
Do they come in banana flavor?

2968
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:30,860
We only have...

2969
02:25:30,860 --> 02:25:32,080
We still have to get more.

2970
02:25:32,780 --> 02:25:33,820
Deeks Drifter.

2971
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,680
This ride is one of a kind.

2972
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:36,960
Oh my god, look how cool he is.

2973
02:25:38,480 --> 02:25:39,120
Wow.

2974
02:25:40,780 --> 02:25:41,600
One more?

2975
02:25:44,400 --> 02:25:45,320
Unsuccessful plant.

2976
02:25:45,660 --> 02:25:47,400
Why won't it grow?

2977
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:50,060
This is so sad.

2978
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:55,160
He's actually very lame.

2979
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:55,420
Oh.

2980
02:25:57,100 --> 02:25:58,880
This is so sad.

2981
02:26:02,550 --> 02:26:03,730
Okay, quit.

2982
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:07,610
Actually, how do you grow a banana tree?

2983
02:26:12,260 --> 02:26:12,900
Huh?

2984
02:26:12,900 --> 02:26:13,280
How do you?

2985
02:26:14,860 --> 02:26:16,620
How do you plant a banana like that?

2986
02:26:17,540 --> 02:26:18,380
Just like that?

2987
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:20,880
So he's just not being patient.

2988
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:23,240
You ask it nicely.

2989
02:26:24,620 --> 02:26:25,760
Give me more money.

2990
02:26:28,700 --> 02:26:29,140
Oh.

2991
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:37,860
You know what?

2992
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:38,580
We'll do this one.

2993
02:26:40,540 --> 02:26:41,700
We can do it real quick.

2994
02:26:46,770 --> 02:26:47,210
Oh.

2995
02:26:47,230 --> 02:26:47,470
Oh.

2996
02:26:47,550 --> 02:26:47,770
Oh.

2997
02:26:47,910 --> 02:26:48,150
Oh.

2998
02:26:48,170 --> 02:26:48,490
Okay.

2999
02:26:49,230 --> 02:26:50,370
Da-da-da-da-da.

3000
02:26:51,670 --> 02:26:52,110
Nana

3001
02:26:58,850 --> 02:26:59,250
that...

3002
02:26:59,250 --> 02:26:59,370
Oh.

3003
02:26:59,370 --> 02:27:00,090
It's cultivated nowadays.

3004
02:27:00,270 --> 02:27:00,750
Don't have seeds.

3005
02:27:01,710 --> 02:27:03,650
Bananas from grocery stores are sterile.

3006
02:27:03,690 --> 02:27:04,890
You have to get a cutting.

3007
02:27:05,130 --> 02:27:05,250
Oh.

3008
02:27:06,110 --> 02:27:07,070
They're sterile?

3009
02:27:07,110 --> 02:27:08,130
They cut off their balls?

3010
02:27:09,030 --> 02:27:09,510
Whoa.

3011
02:27:11,730 --> 02:27:12,570
No way.

3012
02:27:14,710 --> 02:27:15,630
It's so sad.

3013
02:27:18,630 --> 02:27:19,210
All right.

3014
02:27:19,230 --> 02:27:21,770
Look at this monkey waiting for something to do.

3015
02:27:23,870 --> 02:27:24,590
Sorry, guys.

3016
02:27:24,630 --> 02:27:24,990
I'm trying.

3017
02:27:26,150 --> 02:27:29,030
There's going to be like one monkey left without a job.

3018
02:27:29,150 --> 02:27:29,350
Oh.

3019
02:27:30,850 --> 02:27:31,350
What's up?

3020
02:27:31,490 --> 02:27:31,810
Oh.

3021
02:27:32,530 --> 02:27:33,210
What is this?

3022
02:27:34,450 --> 02:27:34,810
Huh.

3023
02:27:39,670 --> 02:27:41,190
Have you ever seen a banana with balls?

3024
02:27:41,310 --> 02:27:42,650
No, because they've all been cut off.

3025
02:27:43,710 --> 02:27:44,070
Duh.

3026
02:27:48,660 --> 02:27:50,760
That's how they get them at the store.

3027
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:52,260
Oh.

3028
02:27:52,320 --> 02:27:52,620
Okay.

3029
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:53,560
We've done this one already.

3030
02:27:53,980 --> 02:27:54,760
Good job, everybody.

3031
02:28:06,230 --> 02:28:07,530
Spyro doesn't greet me either.

3032
02:28:07,690 --> 02:28:08,530
What's up with these guys?

3033
02:28:08,670 --> 02:28:09,410
They're so...

3034
02:28:10,810 --> 02:28:11,530
They're so...

3035
02:28:11,530 --> 02:28:11,830
Um.

3036
02:28:12,710 --> 02:28:13,070
I don't know.

3037
02:28:13,750 --> 02:28:14,110
I don't know.

3038
02:28:14,130 --> 02:28:14,630
Snooty.

3039
02:28:16,370 --> 02:28:17,990
They think they're too good for me.

3040
02:28:18,010 --> 02:28:18,790
They give me a greeting.

3041
02:28:18,950 --> 02:28:19,070
Huh?

3042
02:28:20,210 --> 02:28:20,670
Okay.

3043
02:28:20,810 --> 02:28:21,550
That's fine.

3044
02:28:21,810 --> 02:28:22,230
Whatever.

3045
02:28:22,490 --> 02:28:23,250
I don't care.

3046
02:28:24,550 --> 02:28:25,010
Oh.

3047
02:28:25,090 --> 02:28:25,530
That's so cute.

3048
02:28:28,150 --> 02:28:28,610
Antisocial.

3049
02:28:28,610 --> 02:28:28,850
No.

3050
02:28:30,010 --> 02:28:30,470
Yeah.

3051
02:28:30,490 --> 02:28:31,130
They're snooty.

3052
02:28:32,070 --> 02:28:32,670
All right.

3053
02:28:32,710 --> 02:28:34,210
Let's go out and get some more guys.

3054
02:28:35,510 --> 02:28:36,410
And more money.

3055
02:28:51,070 --> 02:28:51,990
Ten gifted.

3056
02:28:52,790 --> 02:28:53,370
Thank you.

3057
02:28:55,550 --> 02:28:56,210
All right.

3058
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:56,330
Let's go.

3059
02:28:56,350 --> 02:28:56,510
What the octopus?

3060
02:28:57,950 --> 02:28:58,530
What the...

3061
02:28:58,530 --> 02:28:58,750
Wait.

3062
02:28:58,790 --> 02:28:59,490
What the skango?

3063
02:29:02,450 --> 02:29:02,850
Oh...

3064
02:29:04,230 --> 02:29:04,630
Cool.

3065
02:29:12,340 --> 02:29:13,600
What if we try out...

3066
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:13,840
Oh.

3067
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:14,600
Let's try out the cheese.

3068
02:29:16,480 --> 02:29:16,880
Yeah.

3069
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:17,180
I know.

3070
02:29:17,220 --> 02:29:18,240
I've missed a couple of things.

3071
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:18,740
It's all good.

3072
02:29:19,080 --> 02:29:20,260
We'll go back and get them.

3073
02:29:20,700 --> 02:29:21,100
Eventually.

3074
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:23,600
Thank you.

3075
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:24,760
Thank you!

3076
02:29:30,170 --> 02:29:30,970
This music.

3077
02:29:31,450 --> 02:29:31,850
Oh.

3078
02:29:31,850 --> 02:29:32,390
Oh!

3079
02:29:32,450 --> 02:29:33,290
Oh my gosh!

3080
02:29:33,550 --> 02:29:34,070
Sorry.

3081
02:29:39,480 --> 02:29:44,780
Bananas today are grown the way they are because the old kind of bananas that actually had more flavor went...

3082
02:29:44,780 --> 02:29:45,440
That's right!

3083
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:46,540
Wait, I knew that!

3084
02:29:46,700 --> 02:29:52,440
That the old bananas are the... you know like the banana flavoring that is in like candies and stuff?

3085
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:58,240
Yeah, that's why... that's why the banana flavoring is based off of the old bananas.

3086
02:29:59,160 --> 02:30:00,040
I'll be honest.

3087
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:02,300
I like the new banana.

3088
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:04,600
Better, I think.

3089
02:30:06,980 --> 02:30:07,560
Woah!

3090
02:30:07,700 --> 02:30:08,420
We're so tiny!

3091
02:30:14,260 --> 02:30:15,420
We're so small!

3092
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:19,920
The banana plague.

3093
02:30:20,840 --> 02:30:23,340
Yeah, we lost all the other bananas.

3094
02:30:24,100 --> 02:30:25,020
Oh, I see them.

3095
02:30:26,360 --> 02:30:27,240
Oh my gosh!

3096
02:30:27,260 --> 02:30:28,320
I have to parkour up here?

3097
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:30,000
No way!

3098
02:30:34,340 --> 02:30:34,920
Okay.

3099
02:30:35,420 --> 02:30:35,960
Look!

3100
02:30:36,620 --> 02:30:37,180
Oh!

3101
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:39,760
This is so cute!

3102
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:44,600
I

3103
02:31:00,360 --> 02:31:03,160
don't know why I have to be small to do this, but...

3104
02:31:03,160 --> 02:31:04,880
I'm in here with you!

3105
02:31:06,920 --> 02:31:07,480
Oh!

3106
02:31:14,140 --> 02:31:17,820
Very serious discussions of banana herbology in mid chat.

3107
02:31:18,040 --> 02:31:18,900
Yeah, I mean...

3108
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:23,080
Thank you for the three... sorry.

3109
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:24,440
I almost said three hundred.

3110
02:31:25,160 --> 02:31:26,200
For the twenty!

3111
02:31:27,460 --> 02:31:30,350
So much!

3112
02:31:30,650 --> 02:31:31,370
Oops, sorry.

3113
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:41,020
Oh!

3114
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:42,300
Dang it!

3115
02:31:42,800 --> 02:31:44,340
I got my butt zapped.

3116
02:31:57,940 --> 02:31:58,780
Did I get him?

3117
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:02,240
Time to be small!

3118
02:32:04,520 --> 02:32:06,340
Wait, isn't this a guy?

3119
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:07,000
Like...

3120
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:08,520
Isn't...

3121
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:10,300
Wait, what are you?

3122
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:12,200
Oh.

3123
02:32:13,420 --> 02:32:14,360
What are you?

3124
02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:15,940
Are you not one of my robots?

3125
02:32:17,020 --> 02:32:17,500
Anamba.

3126
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:21,020
Oh my god, wait.

3127
02:32:21,100 --> 02:32:21,980
I just noticed the cat.

3128
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:22,600
So cute!

3129
02:32:22,900 --> 02:32:23,720
Can I pet the cat?

3130
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:24,840
Oh, sorry.

3131
02:32:26,540 --> 02:32:27,760
I just tried...

3132
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:28,080
Oh!

3133
02:32:28,460 --> 02:32:29,620
Oh my gosh!

3134
02:32:30,220 --> 02:32:31,600
There's coins everywhere.

3135
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:36,440
Everywhere you wouldn't even expect.

3136
02:32:41,740 --> 02:32:42,220
Whoa!

3137
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:43,540
Ah!

3138
02:32:49,370 --> 02:32:50,670
What are these guys doing?

3139
02:32:51,290 --> 02:32:51,730
Oh!

3140
02:32:52,090 --> 02:32:52,170
Oh!

3141
02:32:52,710 --> 02:32:52,730
Ah!

3142
02:32:56,150 --> 02:32:58,270
This stage has so many small details, right?

3143
02:32:58,790 --> 02:32:59,530
Oh my gosh.

3144
02:32:59,530 --> 02:33:01,090
You guys, if I miss something...

3145
02:33:01,670 --> 02:33:02,370
Call me out.

3146
02:33:02,430 --> 02:33:03,050
Be like...

3147
02:33:03,050 --> 02:33:03,410
Minto!

3148
02:33:03,510 --> 02:33:03,690
Minto!

3149
02:33:04,670 --> 02:33:05,590
Ah, ah...

3150
02:33:05,590 --> 02:33:05,990
Yodel!

3151
02:33:06,170 --> 02:33:06,530
Yodel!

3152
02:33:06,590 --> 02:33:06,830
Yodel!

3153
02:33:09,090 --> 02:33:09,530
Say...

3154
02:33:09,530 --> 02:33:09,810
Yoho!

3155
02:33:09,930 --> 02:33:10,330
Yodel!

3156
02:33:10,410 --> 02:33:10,630
Yodel!

3157
02:33:11,590 --> 02:33:12,030
Yodel!

3158
02:33:12,110 --> 02:33:12,290
Yodel!

3159
02:33:14,330 --> 02:33:16,670
Makes me wonder how much I've already missed over...

3160
02:33:16,670 --> 02:33:19,350
No, the potter plants probably don't have anything underneath them.

3161
02:33:19,350 --> 02:33:20,270
Probably.

3162
02:33:20,430 --> 02:33:21,130
Oh, what's in here?

3163
02:33:23,890 --> 02:33:24,570
Yodel!

3164
02:33:29,270 --> 02:33:29,610
Hmm...

3165
02:33:30,930 --> 02:33:31,610
Oh!

3166
02:33:31,770 --> 02:33:32,310
Just kidding!

3167
02:33:32,950 --> 02:33:33,630
Ah!

3168
02:33:35,340 --> 02:33:37,500
There's probably a bajillion coins here.

3169
02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:39,340
Punch the cheese?

3170
02:33:39,420 --> 02:33:39,760
I did!

3171
02:33:40,520 --> 02:33:40,860
Oh!

3172
02:33:40,940 --> 02:33:41,960
What the...

3173
02:33:45,250 --> 02:33:46,350
Photo spot!

3174
02:33:48,110 --> 02:33:48,790
That's

3175
02:33:54,480 --> 02:33:55,160
so cute!

3176
02:33:55,160 --> 02:33:55,700
Yeah!

3177
02:33:56,340 --> 02:33:58,900
The cats are so cute!

3178
02:33:59,900 --> 02:34:03,140
The reflection on them looks so good, doesn't it?

3179
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:05,060
Like the reflection from their heads.

3180
02:34:05,460 --> 02:34:06,120
Wow!

3181
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:07,780
Looks so good!

3182
02:34:08,870 --> 02:34:09,240
Yeah!

3183
02:34:11,860 --> 02:34:13,300
So cute!

3184
02:34:13,700 --> 02:34:15,100
Worth, worth, worth.

3185
02:34:17,660 --> 02:34:18,400
Oh!

3186
02:34:18,480 --> 02:34:19,100
Hello!

3187
02:34:20,100 --> 02:34:20,840
Ooh!

3188
02:34:22,160 --> 02:34:24,560
I forgot the plot for this the other day.

3189
02:34:24,560 --> 02:34:25,720
Such an unforgettable experience.

3190
02:34:25,980 --> 02:34:26,980
Astro is just the cutest.

3191
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:27,460
Yeah!

3192
02:34:29,320 --> 02:34:30,720
This game is so fun.

3193
02:34:39,740 --> 02:34:40,300
Nice.

3194
02:34:41,260 --> 02:34:41,820
Wee!

3195
02:34:43,400 --> 02:34:43,960
Oh!

3196
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:44,360
Oh!

3197
02:34:47,660 --> 02:34:48,540
Punch him!

3198
02:34:48,820 --> 02:34:49,500
Punch him!

3199
02:34:49,560 --> 02:34:49,860
Punch him!

3200
02:34:50,540 --> 02:34:52,160
More coins under here?

3201
02:34:56,120 --> 02:35:00,180
Yeah, I'm glad though that each level doesn't also have a coin thing.

3202
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:02,760
Hello?

3203
02:35:03,380 --> 02:35:06,600
You know how like... like a coin completion thing.

3204
02:35:06,960 --> 02:35:08,640
Because otherwise I'd be like...

3205
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:13,020
I'd be like it's so much...

3206
02:35:13,020 --> 02:35:13,460
Oh my god!

3207
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:14,140
Oh my god!

3208
02:35:15,580 --> 02:35:16,140
Ah!

3209
02:35:17,820 --> 02:35:18,440
It's not the undies!

3210
02:35:20,980 --> 02:35:22,240
Okay, hold on everybody.

3211
02:35:29,830 --> 02:35:30,630
Very good!

3212
02:35:31,550 --> 02:35:32,110
Wee!

3213
02:35:32,330 --> 02:35:32,890
Oopa!

3214
02:35:32,890 --> 02:35:33,250
Bye!

3215
02:35:36,110 --> 02:35:37,610
We're in somebody's bedroom?

3216
02:35:40,230 --> 02:35:41,310
Are they crying?

3217
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:45,360
What's wrong?

3218
02:35:52,500 --> 02:35:53,100
Oh!

3219
02:35:56,350 --> 02:35:57,550
Home invader.

3220
02:35:57,710 --> 02:35:58,230
I know!

3221
02:35:59,150 --> 02:36:00,130
Under your bed?

3222
02:36:00,470 --> 02:36:01,190
Oh yeah!

3223
02:36:01,330 --> 02:36:02,870
You got rats under your bed, man!

3224
02:36:03,770 --> 02:36:05,290
What if I grow big?

3225
02:36:08,250 --> 02:36:08,830
Nope!

3226
02:36:10,370 --> 02:36:14,120
Can I get under their sheets?

3227
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:15,680
I'm coming in!

3228
02:36:16,260 --> 02:36:17,560
Make room for me though!

3229
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:21,800
What's this?

3230
02:36:24,340 --> 02:36:24,920
Oh!

3231
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:25,700
Oh!

3232
02:36:31,190 --> 02:36:31,480
Cute!

3233
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:34,740
Hello?

3234
02:36:36,100 --> 02:36:36,880
There we go!

3235
02:36:39,460 --> 02:36:40,180
Yeah, I did go underneath.

3236
02:36:40,740 --> 02:36:41,020
Oh!

3237
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:41,320
What's this?

3238
02:36:46,620 --> 02:36:47,140
Wow!

3239
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:53,780
Oh my god!

3240
02:36:53,800 --> 02:36:54,160
So cute!

3241
02:36:59,450 --> 02:37:01,010
I think the clock is broken.

3242
02:37:04,410 --> 02:37:04,930
Yeah!

3243
02:37:07,650 --> 02:37:08,170
Asobi!

3244
02:37:09,130 --> 02:37:10,130
That's what the...

3245
02:37:10,130 --> 02:37:11,170
You see it?

3246
02:37:12,890 --> 02:37:13,890
The numbers.

3247
02:37:13,890 --> 02:37:14,770
What do they mean?

3248
02:37:17,110 --> 02:37:17,690
Oh!

3249
02:37:17,690 --> 02:37:18,430
There's here too!

3250
02:37:20,010 --> 02:37:20,590
Wait.

3251
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:21,070
Right?

3252
02:37:21,550 --> 02:37:22,690
This is a spot.

3253
02:37:22,810 --> 02:37:22,970
Oh!

3254
02:37:22,990 --> 02:37:23,310
Yes!

3255
02:37:29,880 --> 02:37:30,460
Hey!

3256
02:37:31,540 --> 02:37:32,120
What?

3257
02:37:32,200 --> 02:37:35,780
There's so many tiny details in this!

3258
02:37:38,260 --> 02:37:40,300
There's so many tiny details!

3259
02:37:43,460 --> 02:37:44,980
Did I get everything in the room?

3260
02:37:46,660 --> 02:37:47,580
I think so.

3261
02:37:47,700 --> 02:37:48,120
Oh!

3262
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:52,680
Okay.

3263
02:37:52,860 --> 02:37:53,180
Okay.

3264
02:37:53,180 --> 02:37:53,440
Onward!

3265
02:37:56,220 --> 02:37:56,740
Onwards!

3266
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:58,880
It's a horror game all of a sudden.

3267
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:02,480
You can go under the sheets?

3268
02:38:02,740 --> 02:38:03,180
Wait!

3269
02:38:03,260 --> 02:38:03,480
I can?

3270
02:38:13,800 --> 02:38:15,400
How do I get under the sheets?

3271
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:19,280
Oh!

3272
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:22,880
Wait!

3273
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:26,560
Oh my god!

3274
02:38:26,600 --> 02:38:27,580
I almost missed him!

3275
02:38:28,140 --> 02:38:28,900
Thanks guys!

3276
02:38:30,840 --> 02:38:31,880
I have...

3277
02:38:31,880 --> 02:38:31,920
Oh!

3278
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:34,720
I have become the freak in the sheets.

3279
02:38:36,820 --> 02:38:37,920
Mouse in the streets.

3280
02:38:38,420 --> 02:38:39,360
Freak in the sheets.

3281
02:38:41,220 --> 02:38:41,780
Oh my god!

3282
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:42,100
Oh!

3283
02:38:42,120 --> 02:38:42,380
Hello!

3284
02:38:42,540 --> 02:38:43,760
I'm not even touching you.

3285
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:45,020
I was not even looking at you.

3286
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:45,560
Wait!

3287
02:38:45,640 --> 02:38:46,640
There's another freak in the sheets!

3288
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:47,940
I want this grasshopper.

3289
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:52,800
Here we go!

3290
02:38:53,140 --> 02:38:53,500
Who's...

3291
02:38:54,140 --> 02:38:55,120
Who's under here?

3292
02:38:56,320 --> 02:38:56,900
Oh my god!

3293
02:39:03,110 --> 02:39:03,470
Oh!

3294
02:39:03,530 --> 02:39:04,230
There's one more I think?

3295
02:39:04,290 --> 02:39:04,490
Yeah!

3296
02:39:04,490 --> 02:39:04,810
There we go!

3297
02:39:04,870 --> 02:39:05,350
Got it!

3298
02:39:05,410 --> 02:39:05,570
Oh!

3299
02:39:06,690 --> 02:39:07,090
Everything!

3300
02:39:11,530 --> 02:39:12,470
This is the worst!

3301
02:39:16,450 --> 02:39:16,930
That's new.

3302
02:39:20,050 --> 02:39:20,450
Wait!

3303
02:39:20,490 --> 02:39:21,670
We went to this area.

3304
02:39:21,910 --> 02:39:22,230
What is it?

3305
02:39:22,350 --> 02:39:23,310
Why is there an owl here now?

3306
02:39:32,780 --> 02:39:33,180
Oh!

3307
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:33,800
In case you fall.

3308
02:39:33,960 --> 02:39:34,580
You think so?

3309
02:39:37,980 --> 02:39:39,140
I want to test it out.

3310
02:39:40,520 --> 02:39:40,920
Oh!

3311
02:39:44,260 --> 02:39:45,700
It really is what it is.

3312
02:39:46,600 --> 02:39:47,000
Yesha!

3313
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:48,120
Oh!

3314
02:39:49,160 --> 02:39:49,720
It really is what it is.

3315
02:39:51,950 --> 02:39:53,890
This game is actually so kind.

3316
02:39:55,290 --> 02:39:56,690
It gives you...

3317
02:39:56,690 --> 02:39:57,990
It gives you so many...

3318
02:39:57,990 --> 02:39:58,370
Oh my gosh.

3319
02:39:58,730 --> 02:39:59,570
Depth perception.

3320
02:39:59,930 --> 02:40:01,350
It gives you so many...

3321
02:40:03,670 --> 02:40:04,790
Shortcuts and...

3322
02:40:04,790 --> 02:40:05,850
And...

3323
02:40:09,790 --> 02:40:10,350
Checkpoints.

3324
02:40:10,850 --> 02:40:12,730
It just makes it very...

3325
02:40:12,730 --> 02:40:14,630
Do you think I can go in the house?

3326
02:40:15,690 --> 02:40:16,250
No.

3327
02:40:18,150 --> 02:40:19,870
It gives you so many...

3328
02:40:19,870 --> 02:40:20,070
It's like this.

3329
02:40:20,090 --> 02:40:20,510
Chances.

3330
02:40:20,650 --> 02:40:21,270
Hole in the wall.

3331
02:40:22,230 --> 02:40:23,090
That one down there?

3332
02:40:30,540 --> 02:40:31,420
Hold on.

3333
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:33,280
Checking any other holes in the wall.

3334
02:40:34,340 --> 02:40:34,900
This one?

3335
02:40:35,900 --> 02:40:36,340
No.

3336
02:40:38,300 --> 02:40:41,880
I don't see any others.

3337
02:40:43,560 --> 02:40:45,600
Yeah, the game is super duper user-friendly.

3338
02:40:45,700 --> 02:40:45,840
Yeah.

3339
02:40:48,800 --> 02:40:49,460
Not bad.

3340
02:40:49,520 --> 02:40:49,820
It's okay.

3341
02:40:50,260 --> 02:40:54,260
I didn't check so much, so that's why I went back to check.

3342
02:40:55,940 --> 02:40:57,760
Definitely easier than being a calorie mate.

3343
02:41:00,420 --> 02:41:04,660
No, they made it so that it could be enjoyed by literally anybody in this kind of game, you know?

3344
02:41:06,300 --> 02:41:08,420
Like, a baby could play this game.

3345
02:41:09,060 --> 02:41:10,940
I don't mean that in like a bad way, you know?

3346
02:41:11,420 --> 02:41:12,140
Like, it's okay.

3347
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:13,800
It's so sweet.

3348
02:41:14,260 --> 02:41:15,320
It's such a cute game.

3349
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:17,540
I'm glad that anybody can play it.

3350
02:41:20,140 --> 02:41:20,840
I missed one!

3351
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:21,080
Oh!

3352
02:41:23,920 --> 02:41:24,520
Katafari!

3353
02:41:24,700 --> 02:41:26,440
We finally found you!

3354
02:41:41,700 --> 02:41:43,280
They'll make you a star!

3355
02:41:46,180 --> 02:41:47,780
Not on the rolling stage.

3356
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:52,520
That kind of drives me insane, but I respect their decision.

3357
02:41:54,040 --> 02:41:59,180
Kind of drives me insane, but it's fine, I guess.

3358
02:41:59,360 --> 02:41:59,800
Oh!

3359
02:42:02,300 --> 02:42:02,920
What's this?

3360
02:42:05,540 --> 02:42:05,980
Wow!

3361
02:42:06,740 --> 02:42:07,840
Oh my god, so cute.

3362
02:42:13,800 --> 02:42:16,420
Oh wait, I think I need to... There we go.

3363
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:24,420
Go here?

3364
02:42:25,660 --> 02:42:26,600
What do I do with this?

3365
02:42:27,400 --> 02:42:29,240
I have to blow on my controller!

3366
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:29,940
Oh my god.

3367
02:42:30,860 --> 02:42:31,300
I...

3368
02:42:32,260 --> 02:42:33,140
I just...

3369
02:42:33,880 --> 02:42:34,420
I just...

3370
02:42:37,780 --> 02:42:38,220
I just...

3371
02:42:38,220 --> 02:42:38,240
I just...

3372
02:42:38,240 --> 02:42:38,540
I just...

3373
02:42:38,540 --> 02:42:39,720
I just yelled into it instead.

3374
02:42:52,390 --> 02:42:53,530
Do I jump on him?

3375
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:04,040
Oh.

3376
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:04,340
Okay.

3377
02:43:04,420 --> 02:43:05,460
I have to do it as a little baby.

3378
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:07,800
Beep, boop, boop!

3379
02:43:08,360 --> 02:43:09,080
Beep, boop, boop!

3380
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:12,800
Oh my god!

3381
02:43:25,610 --> 02:43:26,910
Go back and check the cat.

3382
02:43:27,070 --> 02:43:29,090
I'm doing this part first.

3383
02:43:31,070 --> 02:43:35,310
This game is actually quite linear, so if you miss a part it's okay.

3384
02:43:37,990 --> 02:43:39,710
I wonder if I can get to the top.

3385
02:43:41,450 --> 02:43:45,530
Well, this actually works too, I think.

3386
02:43:49,670 --> 02:43:50,870
That works.

3387
02:43:54,190 --> 02:43:58,170
Oh my gosh, the squish physics are so cute.

3388
02:44:02,930 --> 02:44:04,370
What is that little disco?

3389
02:44:06,030 --> 02:44:07,090
What is that?

3390
02:44:08,630 --> 02:44:09,110
Ah!

3391
02:44:09,610 --> 02:44:11,270
You son of a...

3392
02:44:12,370 --> 02:44:13,730
You jerk, you!

3393
02:44:22,060 --> 02:44:23,100
I have to go see.

3394
02:44:23,900 --> 02:44:25,460
I have to go see what it is.

3395
02:44:26,200 --> 02:44:27,700
Up a daisy, up a daisy.

3396
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:30,020
Up a daisy, up a daisy.

3397
02:44:32,980 --> 02:44:33,460
Wait,

3398
02:44:46,650 --> 02:44:47,310
should I go on it?

3399
02:44:47,690 --> 02:44:49,690
I think I should, probably.

3400
02:44:49,990 --> 02:44:50,890
Just so I can get it.

3401
02:44:56,050 --> 02:44:57,450
It's okay, we can always come back.

3402
02:45:08,940 --> 02:45:09,800
It's all good.

3403
02:45:10,920 --> 02:45:11,740
We'll get him.

3404
02:45:14,600 --> 02:45:15,640
Oh no.

3405
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:18,380
Box'll bust it up.

3406
02:45:19,220 --> 02:45:20,280
Box'll bust it.

3407
02:45:21,340 --> 02:45:23,000
This one we also didn't complete.

3408
02:45:26,420 --> 02:45:27,500
Nah, he'll manage.

3409
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:29,220
It's fine, it's fine.

3410
02:45:29,660 --> 02:45:30,480
Let's try it.

3411
02:45:33,500 --> 02:45:34,720
Box'll bust him.

3412
02:45:34,900 --> 02:45:35,880
Box'll bust him.

3413
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:40,440
Oh my gosh.

3414
02:45:44,880 --> 02:45:45,440
Yeah!

3415
02:45:46,060 --> 02:45:46,620
Yeah!

3416
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:49,940
Shoo come back for me.

3417
02:45:50,580 --> 02:45:51,820
I'll come back for.

3418
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:53,920
I'll come back for you buddy.

3419
02:45:55,440 --> 02:45:56,000
Choo!

3420
02:45:56,060 --> 02:45:56,800
Thank you!

3421
02:45:58,080 --> 02:45:58,640
Ah!

3422
02:45:58,780 --> 02:45:59,960
Bria, you got it!

3423
02:45:59,980 --> 02:46:00,660
You got the choo!

3424
02:46:03,180 --> 02:46:06,920
Oh my gosh, these levels are so satisfying.

3425
02:46:08,740 --> 02:46:09,380
What's that?

3426
02:46:13,430 --> 02:46:14,490
Is that the moon?

3427
02:46:14,550 --> 02:46:14,930
No.

3428
02:46:15,450 --> 02:46:16,390
What are those?

3429
02:46:20,230 --> 02:46:22,390
These levels are so satisfying.

3430
02:46:41,100 --> 02:46:42,100
They're wisps?

3431
02:46:42,260 --> 02:46:43,320
I don't think so.

3432
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:45,880
I don't think so.

3433
02:46:46,020 --> 02:46:47,480
I want to just destroy everything.

3434
02:46:48,220 --> 02:46:50,800
I want to leave these people with no home.

3435
02:47:02,270 --> 02:47:03,230
Destroy everything!

3436
02:47:04,430 --> 02:47:05,290
Destroy, destroy!

3437
02:47:07,050 --> 02:47:09,730
Okay, before we go that way, let's go up.

3438
02:47:16,720 --> 02:47:19,820
For some reason, I always think that I can't touch those with my hands.

3439
02:47:20,620 --> 02:47:22,540
Oh, what the hell is that?

3440
02:47:24,820 --> 02:47:25,300
What?

3441
02:47:29,640 --> 02:47:30,400
Oh!

3442
02:47:30,400 --> 02:47:31,460
Forgotten mascot!

3443
02:47:32,100 --> 02:47:34,460
Here today, probably gone tomorrow.

3444
02:47:36,440 --> 02:47:37,400
Holy god!

3445
02:47:37,580 --> 02:47:38,120
Oh my god.

3446
02:47:38,300 --> 02:47:39,140
So sad.

3447
02:47:57,660 --> 02:47:58,720
So cute!

3448
02:47:59,260 --> 02:48:01,560
Oh my gosh, this game.

3449
02:48:01,660 --> 02:48:02,880
I can't.

3450
02:48:02,880 --> 02:48:06,600
I can't with how beautiful and cute it is.

3451
02:48:06,640 --> 02:48:07,720
It's just so lovely.

3452
02:48:10,820 --> 02:48:11,200
Oh.

3453
02:48:19,630 --> 02:48:20,510
But we got it.

3454
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:29,680
I didn't realize that the green was from him.

3455
02:48:43,590 --> 02:48:44,310
Take that!

3456
02:48:46,450 --> 02:48:48,110
At least we got the puzzle piece.

3457
02:48:48,490 --> 02:48:49,230
Oh my god.

3458
02:48:53,930 --> 02:48:54,530
Tears!

3459
02:48:56,250 --> 02:48:56,890
Tears!

3460
02:48:56,890 --> 02:48:57,430
Destroy, destroy!

3461
02:48:57,750 --> 02:48:58,730
Leave them with nothing!

3462
02:49:03,230 --> 02:49:04,830
Leave them with nothing!

3463
02:49:06,570 --> 02:49:07,210
Destroy!

3464
02:49:12,090 --> 02:49:13,330
Is that Enderman?

3465
02:49:17,250 --> 02:49:18,070
Come here!

3466
02:49:22,850 --> 02:49:23,850
What is that?

3467
02:49:23,970 --> 02:49:24,630
Puzzle cube.

3468
02:49:25,030 --> 02:49:26,850
Requires a high IQ to solve.

3469
02:49:26,850 --> 02:49:27,670
Oh my god.

3470
02:49:27,810 --> 02:49:28,270
Okay.

3471
02:49:28,450 --> 02:49:29,250
Rick and Morty.

3472
02:49:32,710 --> 02:49:35,310
I don't think there's anything else I can destroy.

3473
02:49:35,610 --> 02:49:36,790
Oh, I see another guy up there.

3474
02:49:40,410 --> 02:49:40,930
Nice.

3475
02:49:42,790 --> 02:49:43,830
Leave them with nothing!

3476
02:49:44,470 --> 02:49:44,810
Oh.

3477
02:49:48,410 --> 02:49:49,710
Who's in there?

3478
02:49:51,350 --> 02:49:52,030
Hold on.

3479
02:49:52,910 --> 02:49:55,350
Before we venture there.

3480
02:49:55,350 --> 02:49:55,370
He's right there?

3481
02:49:57,530 --> 02:49:58,230
Oh, my goodness.

3482
02:50:01,230 --> 02:50:02,290
There's a lot going on here.

3483
02:50:02,350 --> 02:50:02,750
Okay, hold on.

3484
02:50:13,310 --> 02:50:13,670
Wait.

3485
02:50:13,730 --> 02:50:14,910
How do I use this again?

3486
02:50:15,090 --> 02:50:16,690
I think he, like, dashes, right?

3487
02:50:17,350 --> 02:50:17,710
Yeah!

3488
02:50:18,950 --> 02:50:19,310
Yeah!

3489
02:50:23,900 --> 02:50:25,140
There's got to be something up here.

3490
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:28,100
I'm going to find it.

3491
02:50:28,160 --> 02:50:29,040
Whatever is up here.

3492
02:50:30,100 --> 02:50:31,340
Is there a warp in here?

3493
02:50:31,760 --> 02:50:33,100
Okay, there's another puzzle piece.

3494
02:50:34,720 --> 02:50:36,280
This looks breakable.

3495
02:50:37,120 --> 02:50:39,040
Right here.

3496
02:50:45,880 --> 02:50:46,800
Break it all.

3497
02:50:47,020 --> 02:50:47,600
Break it all.

3498
02:50:47,940 --> 02:50:49,620
Give me some to break.

3499
02:50:50,460 --> 02:50:52,280
About this Lego island.

3500
02:50:57,090 --> 02:50:58,910
It's just so addicting, you guys.

3501
02:50:58,970 --> 02:50:59,610
I can't stop.

3502
02:51:00,170 --> 02:51:01,490
It's so satisfying.

3503
02:51:01,690 --> 02:51:02,290
Look at this.

3504
02:51:05,210 --> 02:51:07,230
Look at all these cubes.

3505
02:51:09,490 --> 02:51:14,590
It just feels so good to destroy everything.

3506
02:51:18,890 --> 02:51:20,830
Oh, I left those trees.

3507
02:51:23,110 --> 02:51:23,710
I

3508
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:31,000
don't think I got a single one.

3509
02:51:33,640 --> 02:51:34,620
You know what?

3510
02:51:34,880 --> 02:51:35,780
That's okay.

3511
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,420
We have to go on the way back.

3512
02:51:48,250 --> 02:51:48,770
Whee!

3513
02:51:48,770 --> 02:51:50,850
Ribbon Rider likes all type of music.

3514
02:51:50,950 --> 02:51:52,090
I don't recognize this one either.

3515
02:51:55,330 --> 02:51:55,850
Oh.

3516
02:51:55,850 --> 02:51:56,750
They're still there.

3517
02:51:58,130 --> 02:51:59,470
Wait, did I go down there?

3518
02:52:00,090 --> 02:52:01,050
I did not.

3519
02:52:01,550 --> 02:52:02,870
I see a secret.

3520
02:52:03,670 --> 02:52:06,670
From... from, uh, beyond.

3521
02:52:07,570 --> 02:52:08,090
Here.

3522
02:52:08,730 --> 02:52:09,250
Oh!

3523
02:52:11,830 --> 02:52:12,350
Aha!

3524
02:52:12,350 --> 02:52:13,750
They want me to destroy.

3525
02:52:14,050 --> 02:52:14,510
See?

3526
02:52:14,870 --> 02:52:16,410
They want me to destroy.

3527
02:52:18,450 --> 02:52:19,770
It's part of the game.

3528
02:52:21,330 --> 02:52:21,850
And...

3529
02:52:24,950 --> 02:52:25,950
They say...

3530
02:52:26,750 --> 02:52:27,650
Kill them all.

3531
02:52:28,230 --> 02:52:29,370
I meant Phantom.

3532
02:52:30,370 --> 02:52:31,270
Destroy them.

3533
02:52:31,490 --> 02:52:31,670
See?

3534
02:52:31,750 --> 02:52:32,590
This looks breakable.

3535
02:52:32,710 --> 02:52:32,990
Right here.

3536
02:52:35,730 --> 02:52:36,250
Uh...

3537
02:52:37,720 --> 02:52:38,860
I'm trying.

3538
02:52:39,480 --> 02:52:40,000
Yippee!

3539
02:52:42,380 --> 02:52:43,320
You're too addicted.

3540
02:52:43,540 --> 02:52:43,880
I know.

3541
02:52:43,940 --> 02:52:44,240
I'm sorry.

3542
02:52:46,380 --> 02:52:47,180
Oh, wait.

3543
02:52:50,600 --> 02:52:53,380
And that should... I think that's both puzzle pieces.

3544
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:53,920
Perfect.

3545
02:52:54,200 --> 02:52:56,320
So now we just have one left... one guy left.

3546
02:52:57,100 --> 02:52:58,080
And then...

3547
02:52:58,780 --> 02:53:00,540
That should be it.

3548
02:53:04,420 --> 02:53:05,000
Oh!

3549
02:53:05,060 --> 02:53:07,060
Oh my

3550
02:53:10,440 --> 02:53:10,640
gosh.

3551
02:53:14,940 --> 02:53:15,520
Oh!

3552
02:53:15,520 --> 02:53:16,400
That was so close!

3553
02:53:22,080 --> 02:53:23,240
So... close.

3554
02:53:36,960 --> 02:53:37,900
Nature healed.

3555
02:53:39,380 --> 02:53:39,860
No!

3556
02:53:43,120 --> 02:53:43,600
Save!

3557
02:53:58,060 --> 02:53:59,840
How do you... You don't even have a mouth!

3558
02:54:00,260 --> 02:54:01,740
You don't even have a mouth!

3559
02:54:03,580 --> 02:54:04,240
Oh my god.

3560
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:08,700
There he is.

3561
02:54:11,200 --> 02:54:13,220
I'm gonna go back and do it all over again.

3562
02:54:14,620 --> 02:54:16,420
Little do you guys know that...

3563
02:54:16,420 --> 02:54:17,720
When I'm not streaming...

3564
02:54:17,720 --> 02:54:18,780
Where do you think I'll be?

3565
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:20,300
Destroying the planet.

3566
02:54:22,120 --> 02:54:23,420
This is my safe zone.

3567
02:54:23,780 --> 02:54:25,960
This is my calming area now.

3568
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:27,740
Frustrating stream?

3569
02:54:28,240 --> 02:54:29,540
No, I'm not anymore.

3570
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:32,060
I'll just think about all these little trees.

3571
02:54:34,500 --> 02:54:35,820
Burst into blocks.

3572
02:54:37,120 --> 02:54:38,060
Ah, yeah.

3573
02:54:39,300 --> 02:54:39,940
The

3574
02:54:50,330 --> 02:54:51,270
house is too cute.

3575
02:54:51,730 --> 02:54:53,670
One voxel tree at a time.

3576
02:54:54,590 --> 02:54:55,230
Exactly.

3577
02:54:55,830 --> 02:54:56,410
Oh!

3578
02:54:56,590 --> 02:54:57,170
Oh!

3579
02:54:57,850 --> 02:54:58,330
Oh!

3580
02:54:59,570 --> 02:55:00,150
Wait.

3581
02:55:00,310 --> 02:55:00,490
Oh!

3582
02:55:01,150 --> 02:55:01,730
Haha!

3583
02:55:06,990 --> 02:55:07,470
No!

3584
02:55:15,170 --> 02:55:16,670
Full-starred that one.

3585
02:55:16,790 --> 02:55:18,450
Yeah, gold... gold-crowned it.

3586
02:55:20,010 --> 02:55:22,250
This one, we're missing a puzzle piece.

3587
02:55:22,610 --> 02:55:24,030
I don't feel like doing a run.

3588
02:55:25,910 --> 02:55:27,430
I don't remember how to get here.

3589
02:55:28,130 --> 02:55:30,190
Oh, I go to the... to the...

3590
02:55:31,790 --> 02:55:32,830
The dimension.

3591
02:55:36,850 --> 02:55:37,630
Okie dokie.

3592
02:55:37,670 --> 02:55:39,670
Uh, we were being cheesed.

3593
02:55:40,890 --> 02:55:41,290
Right?

3594
02:55:41,530 --> 02:55:42,110
Yeah, yeah.

3595
02:55:42,230 --> 02:55:43,930
We gotta go back to the cheese world, everybody.

3596
02:55:45,910 --> 02:55:47,630
You missed a few blocks to destroy.

3597
02:55:51,170 --> 02:55:51,790
Thank you!

3598
02:55:52,210 --> 02:55:52,830
Thank you!

3599
02:56:03,050 --> 02:56:03,650
Oh, no.

3600
02:56:03,690 --> 02:56:04,910
I have to get all the coins again.

3601
02:56:05,230 --> 02:56:05,770
Oh, no.

3602
02:56:09,670 --> 02:56:10,130
It's ok.

3603
02:56:11,290 --> 02:56:13,250
I feel like we were pretty far in the...

3604
02:56:13,250 --> 02:56:13,830
I think...

3605
02:56:13,830 --> 02:56:16,710
I think this is the only one that's kind of annoying to...

3606
02:56:16,710 --> 02:56:18,890
do again because...

3607
02:56:20,470 --> 02:56:23,570
I feel we got so far in...

3608
02:56:23,570 --> 02:56:25,010
Like, it was so much.

3609
02:56:27,050 --> 02:56:28,430
What do you mean I don't have to?

3610
02:56:28,950 --> 02:56:30,490
I didn't beat the level, you guys!

3611
02:56:34,090 --> 02:56:36,210
Even if I had gotten that one guy...

3612
02:56:36,210 --> 02:56:37,910
I didn't beat the level.

3613
02:56:38,010 --> 02:56:39,870
There was still another guy that I needed to get.

3614
02:56:42,990 --> 02:56:44,430
The shortcut with the owl.

3615
02:56:45,730 --> 02:56:46,210
Oh.

3616
02:56:46,970 --> 02:56:48,470
I don't think so.

3617
02:56:48,630 --> 02:56:49,770
Because everything is still here.

3618
02:56:49,950 --> 02:56:51,130
Or here again, rather.

3619
02:56:52,130 --> 02:56:52,850
Oh, my god.

3620
02:56:53,370 --> 02:56:54,530
Oh, my god.

3621
02:56:55,130 --> 02:56:56,570
I pressed the wrong button.

3622
02:56:58,510 --> 02:56:58,910
But

3623
02:57:04,220 --> 02:57:05,760
I get more coins.

3624
02:57:05,920 --> 02:57:06,580
So, ok.

3625
02:57:06,700 --> 02:57:06,880
Yeah.

3626
02:57:07,360 --> 02:57:08,340
So, it's kind of like...

3627
02:57:08,340 --> 02:57:08,860
Why not?

3628
02:57:09,140 --> 02:57:10,280
Kind of get them, you know?

3629
02:57:11,380 --> 02:57:12,780
You can just run past everything.

3630
02:57:13,080 --> 02:57:15,420
But I get more gacha stuff.

3631
02:57:16,560 --> 02:57:17,320
So, it's like...

3632
02:57:17,320 --> 02:57:17,720
I don't...

3633
02:57:18,120 --> 02:57:18,820
Why not?

3634
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:19,700
It's just...

3635
02:57:19,700 --> 02:57:20,860
I just gotta run through it real quick.

3636
02:57:20,940 --> 02:57:21,300
You know?

3637
02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:22,000
I don't know.

3638
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:23,920
I just gotta run through it real quick.

3639
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:25,140
Yeah.

3640
02:57:25,220 --> 02:57:25,800
Oh, wait.

3641
02:57:27,180 --> 02:57:28,160
Did I get in here?

3642
02:57:29,180 --> 02:57:31,020
This is where I got the guy.

3643
02:57:31,220 --> 02:57:31,440
Right?

3644
02:57:35,270 --> 02:57:36,130
Gacha brain.

3645
02:57:41,030 --> 02:57:41,570
It's ok.

3646
02:57:41,690 --> 02:57:42,710
We know all their secrets.

3647
02:57:44,190 --> 02:57:47,010
I probably won't get every single one, but...

3648
02:57:49,190 --> 02:57:50,970
I can destroy this even!

3649
02:57:53,610 --> 02:57:54,070
Oops.

3650
02:57:54,090 --> 02:57:54,490
Sorry, cat.

3651
02:57:54,710 --> 02:57:55,290
I'm sorry, cat.

3652
02:57:55,290 --> 02:57:55,330
I'm sorry.

3653
02:57:55,330 --> 02:57:55,670
I'm sorry.

3654
02:58:00,710 --> 02:58:01,150
See you, dog.

3655
02:58:01,150 --> 02:58:01,970
Look, I'm a speedrunner.

3656
02:58:02,850 --> 02:58:04,330
I'm a speedrunner, you guys.

3657
02:58:04,630 --> 02:58:06,310
That was some speedrunning strategy.

3658
02:58:15,690 --> 02:58:16,510
What's this one again?

3659
02:58:18,470 --> 02:58:18,910
Tiny.

3660
02:58:19,190 --> 02:58:19,870
Oh, wait.

3661
02:58:21,230 --> 02:58:22,570
I don't think I did this before.

3662
02:58:26,470 --> 02:58:27,730
I missed this.

3663
02:58:28,590 --> 02:58:30,470
I thought it was just a tiny...

3664
02:58:31,150 --> 02:58:34,250
I thought it was just a tiny coin, but no.

3665
02:58:34,310 --> 02:58:35,110
There's a whole thing in there.

3666
02:58:43,010 --> 02:58:46,170
Min-maxing her runs for coins and her gacha game.

3667
02:58:46,930 --> 02:58:48,490
She's highly experienced.

3668
02:58:49,330 --> 02:58:49,970
Truly.

3669
02:58:51,130 --> 02:58:51,770
See?

3670
02:58:52,030 --> 02:58:53,070
Actually, it was worse.

3671
02:58:57,710 --> 02:58:58,690
It was worse!

3672
02:59:02,690 --> 02:59:04,070
I think I'm gonna sneeze.

3673
02:59:12,270 --> 02:59:12,710
What?

3674
02:59:12,870 --> 02:59:13,210
Okay.

3675
02:59:15,790 --> 02:59:16,810
I see you.

3676
02:59:16,870 --> 02:59:17,090
I see you.

3677
02:59:19,110 --> 02:59:19,850
Grab these.

3678
02:59:22,570 --> 02:59:23,210
Bless you.

3679
02:59:23,250 --> 02:59:23,830
Thank you!

3680
02:59:25,630 --> 02:59:26,070
All the

3681
02:59:30,990 --> 02:59:34,010
vandalism.

3682
02:59:34,110 --> 02:59:36,370
Now that I know I can destroy stuff and get... See?

3683
02:59:36,450 --> 02:59:37,610
These are speedrun strats.

3684
02:59:37,950 --> 02:59:39,770
If you want to get the coins still.

3685
02:59:40,870 --> 02:59:43,150
You gotta destroy the stuff to get it.

3686
02:59:45,750 --> 02:59:48,070
Do you think if I follow that way, I'll be down?

3687
02:59:51,090 --> 02:59:53,090
Do you think it leads to anywhere?

3688
02:59:53,410 --> 02:59:55,650
See how there's like a little groove down there?

3689
03:00:04,100 --> 03:00:07,580
Now this kind of stuff I'm not gonna... You know, I don't need to do that again.

3690
03:00:08,920 --> 03:00:11,160
I like how there's little... It's like, hello!

3691
03:00:17,760 --> 03:00:19,060
Worth checking out.

3692
03:00:22,040 --> 03:00:22,920
Is it though?

3693
03:00:25,540 --> 03:00:26,340
Shut up.

3694
03:00:33,140 --> 03:00:34,040
Grab these.

3695
03:00:34,600 --> 03:00:35,680
Grab these.

3696
03:00:37,720 --> 03:00:38,720
Grab these.

3697
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:40,520
Perfect.

3698
03:00:41,880 --> 03:00:43,420
Looks like it has potential.

3699
03:00:43,580 --> 03:00:43,780
Right!

3700
03:00:45,320 --> 03:00:46,140
Damn it.

3701
03:00:47,180 --> 03:00:47,860
Stop

3702
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:54,620
eating the cheese!

3703
03:00:58,440 --> 03:00:58,780
Um...

3704
03:01:00,520 --> 03:01:04,760
Alright, we're just about back to where we were at before.

3705
03:01:06,480 --> 03:01:06,740
This is great.

3706
03:01:09,440 --> 03:01:10,220
Under the bed?

3707
03:01:10,340 --> 03:01:10,880
Oh, it's okay.

3708
03:01:11,220 --> 03:01:12,200
I'm not gonna get every...

3709
03:01:12,200 --> 03:01:14,020
If I miss a spot, it's okay.

3710
03:01:14,500 --> 03:01:17,380
I'm not gonna be too concerned about it.

3711
03:01:18,180 --> 03:01:19,340
Thanks for the coins!

3712
03:01:20,060 --> 03:01:23,460
I just... I did get to watching...

3713
03:01:23,460 --> 03:01:24,700
Oh, escape from New York!

3714
03:01:25,020 --> 03:01:26,340
Give it a 4 out of 5.

3715
03:01:26,700 --> 03:01:27,140
Nice!

3716
03:01:27,620 --> 03:01:28,660
It's so good, right?

3717
03:01:30,020 --> 03:01:31,780
Escape from New York.

3718
03:01:34,080 --> 03:01:35,040
Snake Plissken.

3719
03:01:47,340 --> 03:01:48,260
There we go.

3720
03:01:48,500 --> 03:01:53,380
Oh, I missed a coin over there.

3721
03:01:53,820 --> 03:01:54,700
But I give up.

3722
03:01:57,780 --> 03:01:58,260
Money!

3723
03:02:00,680 --> 03:02:03,060
A rat broke in and stole my coins.

3724
03:02:03,140 --> 03:02:04,080
And then broke everything.

3725
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:06,800
And also ate my homework.

3726
03:02:06,940 --> 03:02:08,240
Wait, I get to do this part again!

3727
03:02:08,400 --> 03:02:08,520
Okay.

3728
03:02:17,440 --> 03:02:19,600
It just spat all over my controller.

3729
03:02:23,380 --> 03:02:25,640
You guys, the cat is to proceed.

3730
03:02:25,720 --> 03:02:27,060
We gotta get this guy first.

3731
03:02:27,240 --> 03:02:28,840
I don't know why you guys are so like...

3732
03:02:28,840 --> 03:02:29,400
The cat!

3733
03:02:29,480 --> 03:02:29,800
The cat!

3734
03:02:30,040 --> 03:02:31,540
We gotta do this guy first.

3735
03:02:37,180 --> 03:02:39,020
My controller is all broken.

3736
03:02:42,140 --> 03:02:43,520
Wait, do I just...

3737
03:02:47,880 --> 03:02:49,560
Oh, I have to do the same thing as before.

3738
03:02:49,720 --> 03:02:50,960
Where I go in and blow it up.

3739
03:02:51,020 --> 03:02:51,420
Okay, just kidding.

3740
03:02:51,540 --> 03:02:52,600
I don't know why I'm so silly.

3741
03:02:57,440 --> 03:02:57,920
There we go.

3742
03:03:00,800 --> 03:03:02,240
Cute Vtuber playing cute game.

3743
03:03:02,360 --> 03:03:04,020
The stresses of the week are melting away.

3744
03:03:04,300 --> 03:03:05,260
Also spit, Tatsuka.

3745
03:03:07,800 --> 03:03:08,440
I can't...

3746
03:03:08,440 --> 03:03:10,360
I can't blow normally, I think.

3747
03:03:10,360 --> 03:03:10,560
I think...

3748
03:03:11,320 --> 03:03:12,440
Because whenever I...

3749
03:03:12,440 --> 03:03:16,060
Actually, I had someone make fun of me for it before.

3750
03:03:16,380 --> 03:03:18,920
When I was like blowing a dandelion, you know?

3751
03:03:19,080 --> 03:03:20,720
I would go like...

3752
03:03:21,260 --> 03:03:22,920
They'd be like, why don't you do that normally?

3753
03:03:25,540 --> 03:03:26,660
Wait, there was a guy there.

3754
03:03:27,940 --> 03:03:29,900
He's probably upset I'm destroying his home.

3755
03:03:37,770 --> 03:03:38,210
Yeah!

3756
03:03:48,500 --> 03:03:49,500
Anything over here?

3757
03:03:50,860 --> 03:03:51,700
Anything of value?

3758
03:03:52,620 --> 03:03:53,500
All right.

3759
03:03:56,960 --> 03:03:57,400
Shoo!

3760
03:03:58,020 --> 03:03:58,900
And big!

3761
03:04:01,020 --> 03:04:04,340
Wait, is that...

3762
03:04:04,340 --> 03:04:06,960
Oh, I thought that mouse had panties on its head.

3763
03:04:08,600 --> 03:04:10,220
I'd be like, I love this game.

3764
03:04:10,440 --> 03:04:11,220
Oh, just kidding.

3765
03:04:14,320 --> 03:04:16,400
Mouse is just like me, for real, for real.

3766
03:04:19,740 --> 03:04:20,780
Oh, this is like...

3767
03:04:20,780 --> 03:04:21,300
Oh my gosh!

3768
03:04:21,300 --> 03:04:21,620
Oh!

3769
03:04:21,800 --> 03:04:23,240
Depth perception, please!

3770
03:04:23,840 --> 03:04:24,680
This game...

3771
03:04:24,680 --> 03:04:26,680
This is now like true platforming.

3772
03:04:27,760 --> 03:04:28,760
This is...

3773
03:04:37,080 --> 03:04:37,900
There we go.

3774
03:04:38,340 --> 03:04:38,900
Easy.

3775
03:04:39,720 --> 03:04:40,280
Nice.

3776
03:04:59,590 --> 03:05:00,810
There we go.

3777
03:05:00,970 --> 03:05:02,690
This feels so classic, doesn't it?

3778
03:05:04,470 --> 03:05:05,030
Oh!

3779
03:05:05,810 --> 03:05:06,570
Don't get me.

3780
03:05:06,730 --> 03:05:06,830
Ah!

3781
03:05:07,030 --> 03:05:07,750
Don't get me.

3782
03:05:09,730 --> 03:05:10,610
He's yelling.

3783
03:05:10,850 --> 03:05:11,110
Ow!

3784
03:05:11,330 --> 03:05:11,610
Ow!

3785
03:05:11,610 --> 03:05:12,730
I got you!

3786
03:05:13,130 --> 03:05:14,090
I think.

3787
03:05:15,770 --> 03:05:16,530
Far

3788
03:05:23,950 --> 03:05:24,550
rescued!

3789
03:05:27,250 --> 03:05:28,530
Intrepid rodent.

3790
03:05:28,650 --> 03:05:30,750
She's a real page turner.

3791
03:05:31,510 --> 03:05:33,710
Long live the king.

3792
03:05:39,180 --> 03:05:43,260
How much more?

3793
03:05:43,580 --> 03:05:45,180
Okay, we have one more puzzle piece.

3794
03:05:45,800 --> 03:05:46,560
Somewhere.

3795
03:05:50,600 --> 03:05:51,360
Okay.

3796
03:05:52,420 --> 03:05:53,180
Oh!

3797
03:05:53,180 --> 03:05:54,120
Alright.

3798
03:05:54,580 --> 03:05:55,020
Where...

3799
03:05:55,020 --> 03:05:56,520
If I were a puzzle piece...

3800
03:05:57,500 --> 03:05:58,060
Okay.

3801
03:05:58,200 --> 03:05:58,560
Thanks.

3802
03:06:00,860 --> 03:06:03,560
Where would I be if I were a puzzle piece?

3803
03:06:07,440 --> 03:06:08,720
Where would I be?

3804
03:06:10,860 --> 03:06:11,420
Somewhere...

3805
03:06:11,420 --> 03:06:11,740
Oh!

3806
03:06:13,300 --> 03:06:14,480
Where would I be?

3807
03:06:14,980 --> 03:06:15,780
Back down?

3808
03:06:16,560 --> 03:06:17,280
Did I miss?

3809
03:06:20,280 --> 03:06:20,840
Oh!

3810
03:06:20,960 --> 03:06:21,100
Oh!

3811
03:06:21,220 --> 03:06:21,560
Oh!

3812
03:06:24,360 --> 03:06:24,920
Oh!

3813
03:06:24,940 --> 03:06:25,140
Okay.

3814
03:06:25,140 --> 03:06:25,580
Back down below.

3815
03:06:25,860 --> 03:06:26,040
Okay.

3816
03:06:27,340 --> 03:06:27,820
Oh!

3817
03:06:27,900 --> 03:06:28,380
Uh...

3818
03:06:28,380 --> 03:06:29,040
Oh!

3819
03:06:29,420 --> 03:06:29,700
Oh!

3820
03:06:30,080 --> 03:06:30,560
Okay.

3821
03:06:31,360 --> 03:06:31,840
Um...

3822
03:06:31,840 --> 03:06:32,400
Don't grab.

3823
03:06:32,540 --> 03:06:32,860
Don't grab.

3824
03:06:34,020 --> 03:06:34,680
Don't grab.

3825
03:06:39,160 --> 03:06:39,640
Okay.

3826
03:06:39,820 --> 03:06:40,300
Ah!

3827
03:06:41,260 --> 03:06:41,740
Ouch!

3828
03:06:41,820 --> 03:06:42,200
I'll leave.

3829
03:06:43,080 --> 03:06:43,560
Ow!

3830
03:06:43,620 --> 03:06:43,800
Ow!

3831
03:06:43,880 --> 03:06:44,000
Ow!

3832
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:45,480
Um...

3833
03:06:47,100 --> 03:06:48,600
Inside the tower...

3834
03:06:48,600 --> 03:06:50,520
You know, I was thinking that maybe...

3835
03:06:50,520 --> 03:06:51,100
Um...

3836
03:06:51,100 --> 03:06:53,460
Like, in between the cogs, there would be something.

3837
03:06:54,180 --> 03:06:55,700
But I couldn't turn my...

3838
03:06:55,700 --> 03:06:56,760
I was afraid of dying.

3839
03:06:58,600 --> 03:06:59,240
In between...

3840
03:07:08,100 --> 03:07:09,340
Look up from the balcony.

3841
03:07:20,940 --> 03:07:21,540
I see!

3842
03:07:21,620 --> 03:07:21,820
I see!

3843
03:07:21,900 --> 03:07:22,100
I see!

3844
03:07:22,180 --> 03:07:22,920
Oh my god!

3845
03:07:23,820 --> 03:07:24,460
It's so...

3846
03:07:24,460 --> 03:07:25,660
I can't believe I missed it.

3847
03:07:28,400 --> 03:07:29,060
That's so funny.

3848
03:07:36,040 --> 03:07:36,640
Where is it?

3849
03:07:37,360 --> 03:07:38,060
Come on, hand!

3850
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:41,820
Gamers don't look up.

3851
03:07:41,840 --> 03:07:42,580
It's so true!

3852
03:07:43,120 --> 03:07:43,820
It's so true!

3853
03:07:45,440 --> 03:07:46,560
Birdhouse is the end of the level.

3854
03:07:46,620 --> 03:07:47,160
That's what I thought.

3855
03:07:47,280 --> 03:07:48,140
Which is why I was like...

3856
03:07:48,140 --> 03:07:48,440
Wait a second.

3857
03:07:48,780 --> 03:07:49,760
I don't want to go in there yet.

3858
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:50,160
Oh!

3859
03:07:51,340 --> 03:07:52,740
I'm going to have to fight some...

3860
03:07:54,260 --> 03:07:56,820
And we'll have completed this one too.

3861
03:07:56,900 --> 03:07:57,420
100%.

3862
03:07:58,960 --> 03:07:59,480
Oh!

3863
03:07:59,480 --> 03:08:00,000
Oh!

3864
03:08:00,540 --> 03:08:01,060
Oh!

3865
03:08:01,340 --> 03:08:01,860
Oh!

3866
03:08:03,820 --> 03:08:04,340
Oh!

3867
03:08:04,380 --> 03:08:04,900
Oh!

3868
03:08:04,900 --> 03:08:05,200
Oh!

3869
03:08:05,200 --> 03:08:05,720
Oh!

3870
03:08:05,840 --> 03:08:06,360
Oh!

3871
03:08:06,720 --> 03:08:07,680
Why are you...

3872
03:08:07,680 --> 03:08:08,760
Why are you getting hard eyes?

3873
03:08:09,180 --> 03:08:10,040
I'm a little...

3874
03:08:10,040 --> 03:08:10,500
Ow!

3875
03:08:12,620 --> 03:08:13,140
No!

3876
03:08:15,520 --> 03:08:18,180
I have to wait for it to go all the way back around.

3877
03:08:18,360 --> 03:08:18,880
No way!

3878
03:08:24,670 --> 03:08:26,190
Can you just become big?

3879
03:08:29,930 --> 03:08:30,850
Did I get it?

3880
03:08:37,500 --> 03:08:38,760
Did I get it?

3881
03:08:43,100 --> 03:08:43,580
Nope.

3882
03:08:47,460 --> 03:08:51,000
It's like making my controller vibrate so much.

3883
03:08:52,940 --> 03:08:53,920
How was your day, Min?

3884
03:08:54,120 --> 03:08:54,700
It was okay.

3885
03:08:55,380 --> 03:08:56,080
It's alright.

3886
03:08:58,560 --> 03:08:59,120
Oh!

3887
03:08:59,720 --> 03:09:02,340
I don't know if you use Twitter.

3888
03:09:02,460 --> 03:09:05,780
For those who do, you might have saw.

3889
03:09:06,260 --> 03:09:07,120
But actually...

3890
03:09:08,920 --> 03:09:09,740
Oh gosh!

3891
03:09:09,980 --> 03:09:10,560
Dang it!

3892
03:09:10,620 --> 03:09:10,900
Stop!

3893
03:09:12,080 --> 03:09:13,940
I think from there, I just have to jump.

3894
03:09:14,020 --> 03:09:15,020
I think I...

3895
03:09:16,860 --> 03:09:23,820
But my official happy coat is...

3896
03:09:23,820 --> 03:09:24,100
I don't know.

3897
03:09:24,100 --> 03:09:26,580
Like actually, I got a sample of it today.

3898
03:09:26,760 --> 03:09:28,320
It's so soft.

3899
03:09:28,780 --> 03:09:29,640
It's so nice.

3900
03:09:30,380 --> 03:09:30,960
But...

3901
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:32,520
Jump hover.

3902
03:09:32,680 --> 03:09:32,880
Yeah.

3903
03:09:33,700 --> 03:09:34,280
But...

3904
03:09:35,620 --> 03:09:39,380
The pre-orders for it will be up on...

3905
03:09:40,380 --> 03:09:41,520
I think Monday.

3906
03:09:41,800 --> 03:09:42,560
Earth coin!

3907
03:09:42,860 --> 03:09:43,860
Thanks to the 5 gifted!

3908
03:09:45,120 --> 03:09:47,000
Should be up on...

3909
03:09:49,740 --> 03:09:52,080
Up on Monday.

3910
03:09:54,320 --> 03:10:00,240
I, of course, will post the information when it is.

3911
03:10:00,360 --> 03:10:01,060
Oh gosh!

3912
03:10:01,880 --> 03:10:02,520
Okay.

3913
03:10:03,080 --> 03:10:04,900
As soon as I feel like I can.

3914
03:10:07,180 --> 03:10:07,820
Yeah!

3915
03:10:08,780 --> 03:10:09,420
Okay.

3916
03:10:10,960 --> 03:10:12,680
I believe that...

3917
03:10:12,680 --> 03:10:18,080
I was told that they'll probably ship around end of the year.

3918
03:10:19,880 --> 03:10:27,360
As for my other merch that I announced during my anniversary, I still have that in the works.

3919
03:10:28,560 --> 03:10:34,040
Plushies are being produced now and I will be working with a place to...

3920
03:10:34,880 --> 03:10:37,760
As like my store and as fulfillment and stuff like that.

3921
03:10:37,900 --> 03:10:41,340
So it won't be me doing it myself.

3922
03:10:41,800 --> 03:10:43,320
You're welcome, everybody.

3923
03:10:45,080 --> 03:10:48,060
And maybe some other stuff in the works as well.

3924
03:10:49,300 --> 03:10:49,860
So...

3925
03:10:50,660 --> 03:10:51,620
Excited for it.

3926
03:10:53,540 --> 03:10:54,100
Oh!

3927
03:10:54,660 --> 03:10:55,220
Big!

3928
03:10:56,720 --> 03:10:58,580
Wait, there was no boss in this level.

3929
03:11:00,920 --> 03:11:01,740
Seven guys.

3930
03:11:05,610 --> 03:11:06,170
Yeah!

3931
03:11:07,210 --> 03:11:07,770
So...

3932
03:11:07,770 --> 03:11:08,310
Oh!

3933
03:11:08,430 --> 03:11:08,710
Oh!

3934
03:11:08,710 --> 03:11:08,950
Oh!

3935
03:11:08,950 --> 03:11:09,250
Oh!

3936
03:11:09,250 --> 03:11:09,570
Oh!

3937
03:11:10,450 --> 03:11:11,010
Nice!

3938
03:11:13,510 --> 03:11:14,290
So, yeah!

3939
03:11:14,930 --> 03:11:16,650
I'm working on all of that.

3940
03:11:16,810 --> 03:11:17,030
Hmm.

3941
03:11:17,330 --> 03:11:17,510
Hmm.

3942
03:11:17,810 --> 03:11:18,110
Hmm.

3943
03:11:18,110 --> 03:11:18,530
Hmm.

3944
03:11:18,650 --> 03:11:19,210
Hmm.

3945
03:11:19,290 --> 03:11:19,330
Hmm.

3946
03:11:19,590 --> 03:11:19,810
Hmm.

3947
03:11:20,270 --> 03:11:21,070
And yeah!

3948
03:11:22,310 --> 03:11:22,750
Beep!

3949
03:11:22,770 --> 03:11:22,850
Beep!

3950
03:11:22,930 --> 03:11:22,970
Beep!

3951
03:11:23,050 --> 03:11:23,130
Beep!

3952
03:11:23,350 --> 03:11:23,790
Nice!

3953
03:11:26,390 --> 03:11:27,810
So we have this one.

3954
03:11:28,270 --> 03:11:28,990
Oh my gosh!

3955
03:11:29,050 --> 03:11:29,790
Check the meteor!

3956
03:11:32,230 --> 03:11:32,670
Nah!

3957
03:11:33,910 --> 03:11:35,250
Let's go to...

3958
03:11:36,330 --> 03:11:37,210
Wormy Passage!

3959
03:11:38,650 --> 03:11:39,090
Yippee!

3960
03:11:40,170 --> 03:11:43,110
The more you spam something, the more I'm not gonna wanna do it.

3961
03:11:44,550 --> 03:11:45,790
Maybe you're new here.

3962
03:11:45,930 --> 03:11:46,050
Ah!

3963
03:11:46,210 --> 03:11:46,530
Shoot!

3964
03:11:47,810 --> 03:11:48,250
No!

3965
03:11:48,330 --> 03:11:49,070
I wanted to go...

3966
03:11:49,070 --> 03:11:49,430
Hold on.

3967
03:11:49,490 --> 03:11:50,130
I wanna restart.

3968
03:11:51,670 --> 03:11:52,870
I wanna go to that one.

3969
03:11:57,250 --> 03:11:57,690
Oh!

3970
03:11:57,810 --> 03:11:58,110
Oh!

3971
03:11:58,190 --> 03:11:59,210
I don't think I can...

3972
03:11:59,210 --> 03:11:59,650
Never mind.

3973
03:12:03,490 --> 03:12:03,930
Ooh!

3974
03:12:04,330 --> 03:12:04,770
Oh!

3975
03:12:07,110 --> 03:12:07,550
Oh!

3976
03:12:09,070 --> 03:12:09,510
Oh!

3977
03:12:23,120 --> 03:12:24,640
I'm not good at these types of things.

3978
03:12:25,780 --> 03:12:26,220
Wait!

3979
03:12:26,340 --> 03:12:26,560
Ah!

3980
03:12:27,200 --> 03:12:27,860
Got it!

3981
03:12:28,360 --> 03:12:28,800
Oh!

3982
03:12:29,400 --> 03:12:30,420
It's these guys!

3983
03:12:30,940 --> 03:12:31,320
Ja!

3984
03:12:31,380 --> 03:12:31,620
Ja!

3985
03:12:31,700 --> 03:12:31,940
Ja!

3986
03:12:32,020 --> 03:12:32,140
Ja!

3987
03:12:32,600 --> 03:12:33,040
Yeah!

3988
03:12:33,200 --> 03:12:33,620
Take that!

3989
03:12:33,640 --> 03:12:33,800
Hi!

3990
03:12:33,800 --> 03:12:34,580
Little weasels!

3991
03:12:35,880 --> 03:12:36,840
Take that!

3992
03:12:37,440 --> 03:12:38,380
Who's that over there?

3993
03:12:40,540 --> 03:12:41,220
Oh my god!

3994
03:12:43,380 --> 03:12:43,860
Ooh!

3995
03:12:43,860 --> 03:12:44,240
That was close!

3996
03:12:44,640 --> 03:12:45,120
Ow!

3997
03:12:45,360 --> 03:12:45,840
Oh my...

3998
03:12:47,490 --> 03:12:48,930
He ate my hand!

3999
03:13:01,890 --> 03:13:03,250
Why are they flexing?

4000
03:13:04,550 --> 03:13:05,030
Huh?

4001
03:13:06,210 --> 03:13:07,750
Why are they flexing?

4002
03:13:09,070 --> 03:13:10,790
Don't think about eating peanut butter.

4003
03:13:11,950 --> 03:13:14,170
I've never once thought about eating peanut butter before.

4004
03:13:21,220 --> 03:13:21,700
Wait!

4005
03:13:21,800 --> 03:13:22,020
Is this the...

4006
03:13:22,020 --> 03:13:22,980
Life is...

4007
03:13:22,980 --> 03:13:23,160
No.

4008
03:13:23,720 --> 03:13:24,620
I thought this...

4009
03:13:24,620 --> 03:13:24,980
Is this...

4010
03:13:24,980 --> 03:13:25,260
Oh!

4011
03:13:25,300 --> 03:13:25,520
Wait!

4012
03:13:25,540 --> 03:13:26,240
Immune service...

4013
03:13:26,240 --> 03:13:26,540
Is this...

4014
03:13:26,540 --> 03:13:26,680
Oh!

4015
03:13:26,760 --> 03:13:27,320
This is...

4016
03:13:28,120 --> 03:13:30,160
Last of Us?

4017
03:13:30,620 --> 03:13:31,060
Right?

4018
03:13:31,740 --> 03:13:32,180
Ellie...

4019
03:13:32,180 --> 03:13:32,340
Yeah!

4020
03:13:32,380 --> 03:13:33,100
From Last of Us?

4021
03:13:33,280 --> 03:13:34,360
Aspires to be an astronaut.

4022
03:13:39,020 --> 03:13:39,460
Yes!

4023
03:13:39,480 --> 03:13:39,740
Yes!

4024
03:13:39,780 --> 03:13:39,960
Yes!

4025
03:13:39,980 --> 03:13:40,440
I know!

4026
03:13:40,500 --> 03:13:40,780
I know!

4027
03:13:40,820 --> 03:13:41,140
I know!

4028
03:13:41,840 --> 03:13:42,880
Can I climb these?

4029
03:13:51,160 --> 03:13:52,820
I'm gonna punch this guy's teeth in.

4030
03:13:53,140 --> 03:13:54,620
Just like my grandma taught me.

4031
03:13:54,820 --> 03:13:55,100
One!

4032
03:13:55,100 --> 03:13:55,340
Two!

4033
03:13:56,100 --> 03:13:56,540
Three!

4034
03:13:56,580 --> 03:13:56,840
Four!

4035
03:13:57,520 --> 03:13:57,960
Uh...

4036
03:14:00,140 --> 03:14:01,220
I gotta give him the old, like, seven-eight.

4037
03:14:04,520 --> 03:14:04,960
Yahoo!

4038
03:14:05,480 --> 03:14:05,860
Oh!

4039
03:14:12,310 --> 03:14:12,950
Oh, gosh.

4040
03:14:34,710 --> 03:14:35,610
We'll get his butt.

4041
03:14:35,630 --> 03:14:36,170
His butt!

4042
03:14:36,190 --> 03:14:36,590
His butt!

4043
03:14:36,590 --> 03:14:36,990
His butt!

4044
03:14:36,990 --> 03:14:37,390
His butt!

4045
03:14:37,410 --> 03:14:37,810
His butt!

4046
03:14:38,630 --> 03:14:39,070
Yeah!

4047
03:14:39,170 --> 03:14:39,890
I got his butt.

4048
03:14:45,130 --> 03:14:47,670
This is like the most obvious puzzle piece ever.

4049
03:14:52,230 --> 03:14:53,210
Bolt to bits.

4050
03:14:54,090 --> 03:14:54,530
Whoa!

4051
03:14:55,370 --> 03:14:57,650
We are changing the ecosystem.

4052
03:14:59,050 --> 03:14:59,490
Oh!

4053
03:14:59,510 --> 03:15:00,050
Oh,

4054
03:15:03,170 --> 03:15:03,370
my gosh.

4055
03:15:03,430 --> 03:15:04,330
That was so close.

4056
03:15:04,670 --> 03:15:05,090
Yeah!

4057
03:15:08,020 --> 03:15:08,780
I'll take that.

4058
03:15:08,840 --> 03:15:09,120
Checkpoint.

4059
03:15:09,220 --> 03:15:09,640
Thank you.

4060
03:15:09,880 --> 03:15:10,720
But what is this?

4061
03:15:12,880 --> 03:15:14,200
Maybe I shouldn't have taken it.

4062
03:15:17,760 --> 03:15:18,220
Oh!

4063
03:15:19,140 --> 03:15:20,480
I gotta smash him.

4064
03:15:22,080 --> 03:15:23,360
Level music is a bop.

4065
03:15:24,560 --> 03:15:25,180
There we go.

4066
03:15:25,600 --> 03:15:26,480
Got his butt.

4067
03:15:27,780 --> 03:15:30,240
This guy has so many injuries on him.

4068
03:15:30,300 --> 03:15:30,880
Hold on!

4069
03:15:31,620 --> 03:15:32,280
Hold on!

4070
03:15:33,020 --> 03:15:33,480
Gosh!

4071
03:15:33,580 --> 03:15:33,960
You're so close!

4072
03:15:33,960 --> 03:15:34,460
You're so needy!

4073
03:15:34,480 --> 03:15:35,340
Like a cat in heat!

4074
03:15:35,500 --> 03:15:35,720
Stop!

4075
03:15:41,100 --> 03:15:43,800
They sound like Blue from Blue's Clues, you know?

4076
03:16:01,710 --> 03:16:04,710
I don't know why I thought that was...

4077
03:16:05,390 --> 03:16:07,950
Oh, okay.

4078
03:16:08,050 --> 03:16:08,650
I got everything here.

4079
03:16:08,750 --> 03:16:08,910
Cool.

4080
03:16:08,990 --> 03:16:09,090
Cool.

4081
03:16:09,170 --> 03:16:09,310
Cool.

4082
03:16:10,530 --> 03:16:10,970
Okay.

4083
03:16:11,110 --> 03:16:11,510
We got this.

4084
03:16:11,570 --> 03:16:11,910
We got this.

4085
03:16:12,030 --> 03:16:12,310
Look!

4086
03:16:12,830 --> 03:16:13,270
Look!

4087
03:16:14,450 --> 03:16:14,890
Nice.

4088
03:16:16,110 --> 03:16:17,450
They're so wiggly-jiggly.

4089
03:16:18,030 --> 03:16:18,470
Oh!

4090
03:16:18,590 --> 03:16:19,030
Oh!

4091
03:16:21,910 --> 03:16:22,710
What?

4092
03:16:23,250 --> 03:16:25,070
I touched a cactus!

4093
03:16:28,990 --> 03:16:30,210
No way!

4094
03:16:38,550 --> 03:16:39,350
Nice!

4095
03:16:41,190 --> 03:16:41,990
No!

4096
03:16:56,660 --> 03:16:58,080
Best song so far.

4097
03:17:01,780 --> 03:17:02,580
Okay.

4098
03:17:02,980 --> 03:17:03,520
Yeah.

4099
03:17:07,500 --> 03:17:09,120
It's like very chill.

4100
03:17:09,240 --> 03:17:09,920
I do like it.

4101
03:17:10,240 --> 03:17:11,040
Okay.

4102
03:17:11,060 --> 03:17:11,280
Let's go

4103
03:17:22,730 --> 03:17:22,730
to the cactus route today.

4104
03:17:23,170 --> 03:17:23,590
Whoa!

4105
03:17:24,670 --> 03:17:25,090
Whoa!

4106
03:17:26,930 --> 03:17:27,350
Wait.

4107
03:17:27,410 --> 03:17:31,130
Let's go the cactus route first since I think this is the way we're supposed to go.

4108
03:17:35,540 --> 03:17:37,480
This guy has got his cheeks full.

4109
03:17:45,560 --> 03:17:45,980
Wait!

4110
03:17:46,060 --> 03:17:46,420
This is...

4111
03:17:46,420 --> 03:17:47,900
Is this the guy from Last of Us 2?

4112
03:17:50,120 --> 03:17:50,960
Dependable smuggler?

4113
03:17:51,560 --> 03:17:53,120
Tells the occasional white lie?

4114
03:17:55,100 --> 03:17:57,720
Is this also the guy from Last of Us?

4115
03:17:58,020 --> 03:17:58,440
Okay.

4116
03:18:05,160 --> 03:18:05,500
No.

4117
03:18:05,680 --> 03:18:07,400
This part is Joel.

4118
03:18:07,820 --> 03:18:12,800
You know, I've never played or seen Last of Us before.

4119
03:18:13,860 --> 03:18:15,520
How am I supposed to time this part?

4120
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:20,820
He's the second to last one.

4121
03:18:28,440 --> 03:18:29,040
Missed one.

4122
03:18:34,860 --> 03:18:35,480
Oh, I did?

4123
03:18:52,100 --> 03:18:52,620
Oh?

4124
03:19:01,040 --> 03:19:01,880
Oh, I hear someone.

4125
03:19:02,100 --> 03:19:02,280
Oh!

4126
03:19:02,440 --> 03:19:02,960
Oh.

4127
03:19:05,200 --> 03:19:05,880
I got him.

4128
03:19:06,520 --> 03:19:07,120
Thanks, guys.

4129
03:19:07,240 --> 03:19:07,600
Oh, yeah.

4130
03:19:07,620 --> 03:19:07,860
You're right.

4131
03:19:07,900 --> 03:19:08,380
I did miss one.

4132
03:19:09,280 --> 03:19:11,660
I didn't even notice because I was so like...

4133
03:19:11,660 --> 03:19:13,580
I was like, Last of Us.

4134
03:19:15,460 --> 03:19:16,220
Thank you, guys.

4135
03:19:17,680 --> 03:19:18,080
Okay.

4136
03:19:18,120 --> 03:19:18,780
This part...

4137
03:19:18,780 --> 03:19:19,420
I don't know.

4138
03:19:19,440 --> 03:19:19,760
What?

4139
03:19:19,920 --> 03:19:20,280
How...

4140
03:19:20,280 --> 03:19:21,060
Am I supposed to...

4141
03:19:28,640 --> 03:19:29,620
It was so easy.

4142
03:19:41,870 --> 03:19:42,450
There we go.

4143
03:19:43,490 --> 03:19:43,890
Yippee!

4144
03:19:45,030 --> 03:19:45,430
Whoa!

4145
03:19:45,750 --> 03:19:46,130
Whoa!

4146
03:19:46,690 --> 03:19:46,910
Whoa!

4147
03:19:47,570 --> 03:19:47,970
Ow!

4148
03:19:48,070 --> 03:19:48,290
Gross!

4149
03:19:48,790 --> 03:19:49,190
Ow!

4150
03:19:49,390 --> 03:19:49,790
Ow!

4151
03:19:50,190 --> 03:19:50,590
Ow!

4152
03:19:50,590 --> 03:19:51,450
Come here, baby!

4153
03:19:51,750 --> 03:19:52,630
Keep sucking.

4154
03:19:53,290 --> 03:19:55,430
Keep sucking my fingers.

4155
03:19:57,530 --> 03:20:00,030
Maybe I need both fists.

4156
03:20:03,670 --> 03:20:04,750
I like

4157
03:20:08,230 --> 03:20:09,010
their little dances.

4158
03:20:09,310 --> 03:20:10,290
Yeah, I did that.

4159
03:20:11,670 --> 03:20:14,290
That was a little weird, but thanks!

4160
03:20:15,570 --> 03:20:17,390
That's probably how they're feeling right now.

4161
03:20:18,710 --> 03:20:19,730
They're like, Oh!

4162
03:20:21,350 --> 03:20:22,130
Bye, captain.

4163
03:20:23,070 --> 03:20:23,610
Bye!

4164
03:20:24,030 --> 03:20:24,050
Bye!

4165
03:20:24,250 --> 03:20:25,650
Just have to say it like that.

4166
03:20:34,200 --> 03:20:34,920
Coins first.

4167
03:20:35,660 --> 03:20:36,160
Oh, oh, oh!

4168
03:20:36,540 --> 03:20:37,440
Coins first!

4169
03:20:38,840 --> 03:20:39,600
Ha, ha, ha!

4170
03:20:39,760 --> 03:20:40,240
Oh!

4171
03:20:40,600 --> 03:20:41,620
There's a guy in here!

4172
03:20:42,200 --> 03:20:42,680
Hahaha!

4173
03:20:45,080 --> 03:20:45,960
You're welcome!

4174
03:20:51,450 --> 03:20:51,930
Oh!

4175
03:20:52,050 --> 03:20:52,930
I remember this.

4176
03:20:53,150 --> 03:20:53,390
Ah!

4177
03:20:55,210 --> 03:20:55,690
Ha!

4178
03:20:57,750 --> 03:20:58,810
I made it somehow.

4179
03:20:59,110 --> 03:21:00,770
I feel like it's just barely, though.

4180
03:21:01,990 --> 03:21:02,910
I feel like I'm moving on.

4181
03:21:16,470 --> 03:21:17,950
Nice shot, thank you.

4182
03:21:19,790 --> 03:21:20,770
I'm a good gamer.

4183
03:21:23,130 --> 03:21:24,250
You really mean that?

4184
03:21:26,730 --> 03:21:28,030
You really mean that?

4185
03:21:32,680 --> 03:21:34,720
Why is this guy mushroomed out?

4186
03:21:35,720 --> 03:21:37,920
Oh is he a little zombie fungus head?

4187
03:21:38,220 --> 03:21:39,780
Don't give them a chance to grow on you.

4188
03:21:39,900 --> 03:21:42,140
Oh we are infecting all the other robots.

4189
03:21:42,140 --> 03:21:42,340
What?

4190
03:22:01,350 --> 03:22:02,650
I guess we'll die.

4191
03:22:02,990 --> 03:22:03,490
I don't know.

4192
03:22:05,150 --> 03:22:05,930
Oh well.

4193
03:22:11,020 --> 03:22:12,700
Making sure I didn't miss anything.

4194
03:22:14,340 --> 03:22:15,700
What have you done?

4195
03:22:23,680 --> 03:22:29,320
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

4196
03:22:32,200 --> 03:22:32,720
Okay.

4197
03:22:37,720 --> 03:22:38,540
Okay, nice.

4198
03:22:39,880 --> 03:22:41,180
Is there anything else in there?

4199
03:22:43,580 --> 03:22:45,880
I don't think I saw anything else.

4200
03:22:46,540 --> 03:22:48,020
The chambered nautilus.

4201
03:22:48,180 --> 03:22:49,420
Yeah, they're cute, aren't they?

4202
03:22:50,880 --> 03:22:54,360
How many more guys do we have?

4203
03:22:54,420 --> 03:22:54,780
Just the one.

4204
03:22:55,000 --> 03:22:55,160
Okay.

4205
03:22:58,200 --> 03:22:59,320
We have them all y'all.

4206
03:22:59,740 --> 03:23:10,440
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

4207
03:23:10,880 --> 03:23:11,040
Hahaha.

4208
03:23:12,200 --> 03:23:14,580
The AI thinks you're playing The Last of Us.

4209
03:23:16,360 --> 03:23:18,020
I mean, I can understand that.

4210
03:23:18,040 --> 03:23:19,480
We've been talking about it.

4211
03:23:21,880 --> 03:23:23,460
Yeah, get yourself ready.

4212
03:23:24,020 --> 03:23:26,220
Oh shoot, oh shoot, oh shoot.

4213
03:23:26,520 --> 03:23:27,280
Ah, that was close.

4214
03:23:33,740 --> 03:23:36,860
Woo, we killed the man and he blew up.

4215
03:23:36,920 --> 03:23:37,840
It was so beautiful.

4216
03:23:40,880 --> 03:23:42,100
We're missing one though.

4217
03:23:43,700 --> 03:23:45,800
I can't, I cannot continue onward.

4218
03:23:47,980 --> 03:23:48,920
We're missing one.

4219
03:23:50,280 --> 03:23:50,940
Is it you?

4220
03:23:58,020 --> 03:23:58,860
Go forward.

4221
03:23:59,100 --> 03:24:01,660
But, but, but, but our last guy.

4222
03:24:02,320 --> 03:24:03,020
Go ahead?

4223
03:24:03,220 --> 03:24:03,440
Okay.

4224
03:24:04,220 --> 03:24:05,860
Is it because it'll be a big old boss?

4225
03:24:11,730 --> 03:24:13,210
Oh, oh, oh, ahhh!

4226
03:24:21,600 --> 03:24:22,280
Oh, gross.

4227
03:24:25,540 --> 03:24:26,260
Oh my god.

4228
03:24:29,020 --> 03:24:32,000
Oh, it's actually really... Oh, it's so squishy!

4229
03:24:36,560 --> 03:24:37,680
The heartbeat!

4230
03:24:38,140 --> 03:24:39,560
Oh shoot.

4231
03:24:40,500 --> 03:24:41,320
Oh my god.

4232
03:24:52,220 --> 03:24:54,260
Oh my gosh, it's so fast!

4233
03:24:55,560 --> 03:24:56,800
It's so fast!

4234
03:24:57,100 --> 03:24:57,600
Okay, okay.

4235
03:25:16,920 --> 03:25:18,540
I hate these levels.

4236
03:25:18,600 --> 03:25:20,420
They stress me out more than like...

4237
03:25:21,100 --> 03:25:21,700
anything.

4238
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:23,060
Like I know...

4239
03:25:23,060 --> 03:25:25,180
I know everything...

4240
03:25:25,180 --> 03:25:27,600
needs like a time level, you know?

4241
03:25:27,840 --> 03:25:29,060
I get it.

4242
03:25:30,140 --> 03:25:30,740
But...

4243
03:25:36,530 --> 03:25:38,570
I'm not good with these kinds of things!

4244
03:25:43,610 --> 03:25:44,210
Ewww!

4245
03:25:46,150 --> 03:25:46,750
Wait...

4246
03:25:46,750 --> 03:25:48,470
I think I'm supposed to...

4247
03:25:48,470 --> 03:25:48,770
Launch!

4248
03:25:50,250 --> 03:25:51,030
There we go.

4249
03:25:52,270 --> 03:25:52,570
I

4250
03:25:58,160 --> 03:25:59,060
think we also...

4251
03:25:59,140 --> 03:26:00,140
Oh, 100% of this one.

4252
03:26:10,690 --> 03:26:12,030
I love baby games.

4253
03:26:12,150 --> 03:26:12,950
They make me feel good.

4254
03:26:14,430 --> 03:26:16,590
They make me feel like I can accomplish things.

4255
03:26:22,710 --> 03:26:26,970
Alright, now I'm gonna go check out...

4256
03:26:29,210 --> 03:26:31,930
Wait, this is the same meteor I did earlier!

4257
03:26:32,450 --> 03:26:33,950
It didn't even change into anything!

4258
03:26:35,390 --> 03:26:36,630
I literally did this...

4259
03:26:36,630 --> 03:26:37,030
Oh!

4260
03:26:42,490 --> 03:26:43,990
Lost triangle, boy!

4261
03:26:48,620 --> 03:26:50,140
Why did it go from being a...

4262
03:26:52,580 --> 03:26:54,420
From being a circle to a triangle?

4263
03:26:57,200 --> 03:26:58,000
Oh my gosh!

4264
03:26:58,600 --> 03:27:00,100
It's like the paperclip!

4265
03:27:06,270 --> 03:27:06,790
Wow...

4266
03:27:06,790 --> 03:27:08,190
Everything is triangle.

4267
03:27:09,210 --> 03:27:10,430
Are there people here?

4268
03:27:10,610 --> 03:27:11,370
Nothing, no?

4269
03:27:13,070 --> 03:27:14,250
Just a triangle.

4270
03:27:15,090 --> 03:27:16,930
Can you follow the triangle path?

4271
03:27:17,610 --> 03:27:18,210
Okay.

4272
03:27:22,160 --> 03:27:24,280
How Metal Gear Delta of them, yeah.

4273
03:27:24,820 --> 03:27:25,420
Oh!

4274
03:27:29,640 --> 03:27:30,240
Clippy?

4275
03:27:30,380 --> 03:27:31,140
Yeah, yeah, Clippy!

4276
03:27:38,520 --> 03:27:40,340
I'm gonna hit all four of them.

4277
03:27:42,080 --> 03:27:42,900
Never mind.

4278
03:27:43,080 --> 03:27:43,980
They're coming with.

4279
03:27:45,460 --> 03:27:46,060
Clippy!

4280
03:27:46,840 --> 03:27:47,440
Clippy!

4281
03:27:47,620 --> 03:27:47,740
Clippy!

4282
03:27:47,740 --> 03:27:53,120
What are these now?

4283
03:27:53,480 --> 03:27:53,840
What?

4284
03:27:55,400 --> 03:27:57,440
Cut and grind...

4285
03:27:57,440 --> 03:27:58,860
What the...?

4286
03:27:58,860 --> 03:28:06,160
What are these?

4287
03:28:08,560 --> 03:28:10,960
Oh, shit!

4288
03:28:23,680 --> 03:28:25,120
Oh my God!

4289
03:28:25,420 --> 03:28:26,620
Oh...

4290
03:28:26,620 --> 03:28:29,600
Oh, okay!

4291
03:28:29,600 --> 03:28:29,700
Okay.

4292
03:28:40,560 --> 03:28:41,940
This one is kind of tough.

4293
03:28:46,080 --> 03:28:48,100
That was close.

4294
03:29:03,750 --> 03:29:04,650
Rookie cop!

4295
03:29:04,910 --> 03:29:07,430
Worst first day on the job ever!

4296
03:29:10,890 --> 03:29:11,210
Leon!

4297
03:29:11,210 --> 03:29:11,430
Leon!

4298
03:29:16,980 --> 03:29:17,920
Where's Tri, baby?

4299
03:29:21,080 --> 03:29:22,940
Is that the only thing there?

4300
03:29:25,600 --> 03:29:26,800
Yeah, it sure is.

4301
03:29:27,740 --> 03:29:28,940
Is there anything left here?

4302
03:29:29,320 --> 03:29:29,840
Nope.

4303
03:29:30,060 --> 03:29:31,240
Just a bunch of stars.

4304
03:29:33,680 --> 03:29:34,520
Dashing Dillo?

4305
03:29:35,440 --> 03:29:37,220
That one was freaky though.

4306
03:29:37,320 --> 03:29:39,820
I was kind of stressed in that last one.

4307
03:29:39,960 --> 03:29:40,820
I'm not gonna lie.

4308
03:29:41,580 --> 03:29:43,020
I was stressed in there.

4309
03:29:44,340 --> 03:29:44,980
Oh!

4310
03:29:44,980 --> 03:29:45,300
Ow!

4311
03:29:45,440 --> 03:29:46,600
It's the Persona!

4312
03:29:52,890 --> 03:29:53,530
Okay.

4313
03:29:53,770 --> 03:29:55,250
I think we can do this one.

4314
03:29:56,150 --> 03:29:57,210
What the hell?

4315
03:30:00,860 --> 03:30:02,320
Someone died here!

4316
03:30:03,600 --> 03:30:04,240
Oh.

4317
03:30:06,730 --> 03:30:07,950
I lost my Armadillo?

4318
03:30:13,710 --> 03:30:14,730
Leave him.

4319
03:30:15,730 --> 03:30:16,370
Okay.

4320
03:30:20,630 --> 03:30:21,270
Nice.

4321
03:30:31,470 --> 03:30:32,030
Oh,

4322
03:31:04,250 --> 03:31:05,170
wait a second.

4323
03:31:05,270 --> 03:31:06,350
This is too much.

4324
03:31:13,730 --> 03:31:14,370
There's more!

4325
03:31:14,910 --> 03:31:15,770
Oh my god!

4326
03:31:15,810 --> 03:31:17,110
There's another De- Sorry.

4327
03:31:18,070 --> 03:31:18,410
Sorry.

4328
03:31:26,380 --> 03:31:26,940
Yay!

4329
03:31:37,530 --> 03:31:38,490
Adorable shadow!

4330
03:31:38,810 --> 03:31:40,350
Catch them on the midnight channel!

4331
03:31:40,550 --> 03:31:42,250
This is Persona 4, right?

4332
03:31:42,570 --> 03:31:44,030
That's the midnight channel, right?

4333
03:31:44,310 --> 03:31:45,430
Epic Gamer Minto.

4334
03:31:45,570 --> 03:31:46,130
Thank you!

4335
03:31:46,370 --> 03:31:46,830
Teddy!

4336
03:31:46,830 --> 03:31:47,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4337
03:31:52,770 --> 03:31:53,730
True gamer.

4338
03:31:56,050 --> 03:31:57,690
That one stressed me out.

4339
03:31:57,830 --> 03:31:58,810
I think even more.

4340
03:32:01,790 --> 03:32:02,750
My goodness.

4341
03:32:05,650 --> 03:32:06,970
Known as Kuma in Japan.

4342
03:32:08,710 --> 03:32:09,670
Pumpkin Peril!

4343
03:32:10,610 --> 03:32:11,090
Pumpkin!

4344
03:32:13,110 --> 03:32:14,530
These ones are- I don't like them.

4345
03:32:14,670 --> 03:32:15,550
Well, I like them.

4346
03:32:15,550 --> 03:32:17,630
But they're supposed to scare me so much.

4347
03:32:18,870 --> 03:32:19,490
Who's here?

4348
03:32:19,930 --> 03:32:20,330
Oh!

4349
03:32:21,770 --> 03:32:23,250
Other Resident Evil girl?

4350
03:32:23,410 --> 03:32:24,170
I can't remember her name.

4351
03:32:29,520 --> 03:32:29,920
Oh.

4352
03:32:29,920 --> 03:32:30,320
Oh.

4353
03:32:31,340 --> 03:32:33,240
Wait, how am I supposed to defeat these guys again?

4354
03:32:33,320 --> 03:32:33,700
I don't remember.

4355
03:32:34,640 --> 03:32:35,040
Claire!

4356
03:32:36,500 --> 03:32:36,900
God.

4357
03:32:47,470 --> 03:32:47,850
Okay.

4358
03:32:47,970 --> 03:32:49,730
My timing is a little...

4359
03:33:01,160 --> 03:33:01,680
Puncher Leo?

4360
03:33:01,780 --> 03:33:02,380
I just punched him?

4361
03:33:02,460 --> 03:33:02,860
Okay, okay.

4362
03:33:05,040 --> 03:33:06,500
I defeated all the other ones.

4363
03:33:07,120 --> 03:33:09,120
First try for me to reach the top.

4364
03:33:09,120 --> 03:33:09,720
Zero this one.

4365
03:33:11,640 --> 03:33:13,620
I just have to be more patient.

4366
03:33:14,800 --> 03:33:15,920
But I...

4367
03:33:15,920 --> 03:33:17,160
Oh

4368
03:33:23,330 --> 03:33:24,570
my gosh.

4369
03:33:24,630 --> 03:33:25,090
Okay.

4370
03:33:25,790 --> 03:33:27,010
This one's tricky.

4371
03:33:34,800 --> 03:33:36,860
It's even like ice skating.

4372
03:33:37,180 --> 03:33:38,420
So it's like...

4373
03:33:39,150 --> 03:33:40,400
Oh my gosh!

4374
03:33:43,970 --> 03:33:46,420
It's not even just like a normal like you...

4375
03:33:47,020 --> 03:33:48,560
Are there, you know?

4376
03:33:48,580 --> 03:33:49,400
It's like also.

4377
03:33:51,420 --> 03:33:55,980
It's like a skating aspect to...

4378
03:34:00,550 --> 03:34:02,150
What the heck is this?

4379
03:34:03,210 --> 03:34:04,190
Oh my god!

4380
03:34:10,070 --> 03:34:10,610
Ahhh!

4381
03:34:12,190 --> 03:34:13,050
Oh my god.

4382
03:34:13,110 --> 03:34:13,870
This is awful.

4383
03:34:16,930 --> 03:34:18,390
Oh my gosh.

4384
03:34:19,350 --> 03:34:20,470
Give me a break.

4385
03:34:21,670 --> 03:34:23,870
I have to save a heart, girl.

4386
03:34:24,030 --> 03:34:24,410
Save the heart.

4387
03:34:25,310 --> 03:34:29,590
Wait, I have to skate?

4388
03:34:29,830 --> 03:34:30,930
Okay, so that's ice.

4389
03:34:32,210 --> 03:34:37,370
Oh my gosh, and then I have to make sure I'm not on the electric... Oh my god!

4390
03:34:38,070 --> 03:34:39,510
This is so hard!

4391
03:34:40,450 --> 03:34:40,930
Stop!

4392
03:34:42,570 --> 03:34:43,050
Okay.

4393
03:34:45,570 --> 03:34:47,430
Hot babe at the top of the tower.

4394
03:34:47,890 --> 03:34:49,490
Hot babe at the top of the tower.

4395
03:35:17,040 --> 03:35:20,140
The fact that this one doesn't even give you a break because you're dealing with this guy.

4396
03:35:20,560 --> 03:35:23,480
Oh my gosh.

4397
03:35:30,990 --> 03:35:33,690
I thought the hot babe was at the bottom right of my screen.

4398
03:35:39,510 --> 03:35:40,310
Stop it!

4399
03:35:49,910 --> 03:35:50,790
Oh my gosh.

4400
03:36:00,060 --> 03:36:01,140
Okay, we made it.

4401
03:36:15,340 --> 03:36:16,700
Sniped, I know, right?

4402
03:36:25,280 --> 03:36:28,440
This is really... This is how you get used to the game.

4403
03:36:28,940 --> 03:36:29,940
Oh my gosh, wait.

4404
03:36:30,040 --> 03:36:30,760
I can't see anything.

4405
03:36:30,940 --> 03:36:32,520
I can't... My depth perception, you guys.

4406
03:36:33,600 --> 03:36:34,480
My depth perception.

4407
03:36:36,940 --> 03:36:37,740
No, please.

4408
03:36:38,340 --> 03:36:38,740
Please.

4409
03:36:39,040 --> 03:36:39,840
Kill, kill, kill.

4410
03:36:39,980 --> 03:36:40,520
Okay, okay, okay.

4411
03:36:40,940 --> 03:36:41,900
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4412
03:36:44,820 --> 03:36:47,940
We're back to where we were before.

4413
03:36:50,460 --> 03:36:52,400
These triangle levels are no joke.

4414
03:37:02,350 --> 03:37:03,870
What the... No!

4415
03:37:04,430 --> 03:37:05,910
He didn't shoot!

4416
03:37:06,190 --> 03:37:07,390
Oh, what?

4417
03:37:08,110 --> 03:37:09,490
No way.

4418
03:37:10,130 --> 03:37:10,850
No!

4419
03:37:15,750 --> 03:37:20,250
Yeah, he didn't even shoot though.

4420
03:37:20,370 --> 03:37:22,090
I think I ran into him.

4421
03:37:23,070 --> 03:37:25,470
I think I ran into him and that's what happened.

4422
03:37:27,570 --> 03:37:28,290
I think

4423
03:37:32,830 --> 03:37:36,870
I ran into him and that's what happened.

4424
03:37:36,870 --> 03:37:39,290
I think I'm going to ignore the jelly guy, yeah.

4425
03:37:40,290 --> 03:37:41,530
I was a faster.

4426
03:37:41,850 --> 03:37:44,070
I think I'm going to try ignoring the jelly guy, yeah.

4427
03:37:57,400 --> 03:37:58,040
Oh shoot.

4428
03:38:10,880 --> 03:38:13,860
This level is so tricky!

4429
03:38:16,740 --> 03:38:18,960
I'm going to be so good at the game after this.

4430
03:38:32,540 --> 03:38:33,880
There's spikes there!

4431
03:38:43,540 --> 03:38:44,660
I gasped.

4432
03:38:51,200 --> 03:38:55,200
More for XO to compliment the controller buttons.

4433
03:38:55,300 --> 03:38:56,260
Yeah, no, I believe that.

4434
03:38:56,380 --> 03:38:58,420
But I'm also shocked why am I...

4435
03:38:58,420 --> 03:39:04,260
I haven't used the triangle button even once in this challenge.

4436
03:39:09,180 --> 03:39:12,200
So much for celebrating the triangle button.

4437
03:39:12,400 --> 03:39:17,320
But it doesn't even use the triangle... triangle button.

4438
03:39:21,860 --> 03:39:22,460
Got him!

4439
03:39:22,560 --> 03:39:22,860
Okay.

4440
03:39:23,540 --> 03:39:23,980
Joy!

4441
03:39:24,200 --> 03:39:24,900
Thank you!

4442
03:39:26,600 --> 03:39:28,820
Thank you so much for the prank!

4443
03:39:30,600 --> 03:39:31,460
Thank you, thank you.

4444
03:39:33,620 --> 03:39:34,860
I don't think they... okay.

4445
03:39:35,200 --> 03:39:35,900
Ignore him.

4446
03:39:39,680 --> 03:39:41,060
I'm scared of this part!

4447
03:39:41,780 --> 03:39:43,460
I did not like the baby games.

4448
03:39:44,860 --> 03:39:45,300
Damn!

4449
03:39:45,480 --> 03:39:46,960
Thank you so much for the tiny gift attack!

4450
03:39:47,000 --> 03:39:47,320
Thank you!

4451
03:39:49,860 --> 03:39:52,480
What makes you think they're going to make you use the triangle?

4452
03:39:58,910 --> 03:39:59,570
You're right.

4453
03:39:59,710 --> 03:39:59,990
Nothing.

4454
03:40:02,930 --> 03:40:03,650
Good luck!

4455
03:40:03,930 --> 03:40:04,230
Thank you!

4456
03:40:16,480 --> 03:40:19,660
Okay, I'm going to come back to this planet.

4457
03:40:23,820 --> 03:40:25,420
I want to see this one though, real quick.

4458
03:40:26,020 --> 03:40:26,800
I'm curious.

4459
03:40:27,380 --> 03:40:28,440
Fragile Frenzy.

4460
03:40:29,520 --> 03:40:30,780
Let's see what this one's like.

4461
03:40:38,050 --> 03:40:38,550
Oh!

4462
03:40:39,550 --> 03:40:40,710
I guess...

4463
03:40:58,170 --> 03:40:59,170
I want...

4464
03:41:01,290 --> 03:41:01,790
Okay.

4465
03:41:02,810 --> 03:41:03,790
I was greedy.

4466
03:41:09,210 --> 03:41:10,450
I was greedy.

4467
03:41:11,010 --> 03:41:11,890
But it's okay.

4468
03:41:12,290 --> 03:41:13,190
Oh my gosh.

4469
03:41:17,600 --> 03:41:19,020
How am I supposed to do that part?

4470
03:41:19,020 --> 03:41:19,800
Hmm...

4471
03:41:20,320 --> 03:41:20,940
Hold on.

4472
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:21,980
I'm going to test something real quick.

4473
03:41:31,520 --> 03:41:32,720
I'm just going to go for it.

4474
03:41:45,670 --> 03:41:46,630
Don't double jump?

4475
03:41:49,370 --> 03:41:51,290
Do they break with you just stepping on them?

4476
03:41:51,530 --> 03:41:51,970
Oh!

4477
03:41:52,090 --> 03:41:52,770
They don't!

4478
03:41:53,390 --> 03:41:53,870
Oh!

4479
03:41:55,090 --> 03:41:55,570
All

4480
03:42:01,930 --> 03:42:02,350
right!

4481
03:42:08,380 --> 03:42:09,160
Hot mo!

4482
03:42:09,680 --> 03:42:10,620
Thank you for the hot mo!

4483
03:42:11,180 --> 03:42:13,100
We're not talking about this square.

4484
03:42:14,240 --> 03:42:15,200
Or this...

4485
03:42:16,440 --> 03:42:16,920
Circle?

4486
03:42:17,300 --> 03:42:18,360
Or this X?

4487
03:42:18,440 --> 03:42:20,160
We're talking about this triangle!

4488
03:42:22,340 --> 03:42:23,280
Oh my gosh.

4489
03:42:23,340 --> 03:42:25,120
Johnny Bravo, are you into pear shapes?

4490
03:42:26,800 --> 03:42:27,820
Thank you so much!

4491
03:42:29,520 --> 03:42:30,720
Thank you for the hot mo!

4492
03:42:30,720 --> 03:42:31,400
Thank you!

4493
03:42:33,440 --> 03:42:33,920
My

4494
03:42:48,440 --> 03:42:48,600
bad.

4495
03:42:48,720 --> 03:42:50,820
I need to just do what I do at the beginning.

4496
03:42:51,220 --> 03:42:51,920
For these.

4497
03:42:59,610 --> 03:43:00,570
So here...

4498
03:43:00,570 --> 03:43:01,530
I can just... yeah.

4499
03:43:04,900 --> 03:43:06,140
Oh my gosh.

4500
03:43:12,910 --> 03:43:13,590
All right.

4501
03:43:15,630 --> 03:43:16,190
Here.

4502
03:43:17,630 --> 03:43:18,190
Here.

4503
03:43:18,410 --> 03:43:19,550
Doritos shaped woman.

4504
03:43:19,670 --> 03:43:20,030
My beloved.

4505
03:43:22,530 --> 03:43:24,770
Put all the waifu behind the challenge level.

4506
03:43:24,890 --> 03:43:25,110
Right.

4507
03:43:26,650 --> 03:43:27,570
Keep going.

4508
03:43:27,850 --> 03:43:28,310
I'm trying.

4509
03:43:37,970 --> 03:43:39,090
Oh suck.

4510
03:43:53,800 --> 03:43:55,220
I know what I have to do.

4511
03:43:55,220 --> 03:43:56,940
I don't know what to do there, though.

4512
03:43:57,720 --> 03:44:00,400
Do I not get that thing because it falls down?

4513
03:44:00,580 --> 03:44:01,400
I guess that kind of sucks.

4514
03:44:05,580 --> 03:44:08,180
But this one, I guess I can double jump.

4515
03:44:09,600 --> 03:44:12,560
It just is also scary, this level.

4516
03:44:21,250 --> 03:44:23,050
Why would I think otherwise?

4517
03:44:28,650 --> 03:44:29,010
Delta!

4518
03:44:37,680 --> 03:44:38,540
Oh my gosh.

4519
03:44:38,660 --> 03:44:40,180
How am I supposed to get past the poops?

4520
03:44:40,980 --> 03:44:42,220
They're all going to spit on me.

4521
03:44:50,900 --> 03:44:51,260
Okay.

4522
03:44:51,260 --> 03:44:51,960
I'll be honest.

4523
03:44:52,340 --> 03:44:54,220
I don't think I'm in the mood for challenges anymore.

4524
03:44:54,840 --> 03:44:57,240
We got past two of them.

4525
03:44:57,620 --> 03:44:58,500
I think I'm tired.

4526
03:44:59,000 --> 03:45:00,160
I think I'm tired, you guys.

4527
03:45:00,520 --> 03:45:01,400
I'm not going to lie.

4528
03:45:02,880 --> 03:45:05,220
I think we've gone through enough of them.

4529
03:45:07,420 --> 03:45:09,060
I think I've gone through enough of them.

4530
03:45:10,860 --> 03:45:12,640
We can do them next time, maybe.

4531
03:45:14,620 --> 03:45:15,840
Let's try the boss.

4532
03:45:16,900 --> 03:45:17,960
Oh, what was that over there?

4533
03:45:19,400 --> 03:45:20,060
Baby game.

4534
03:45:20,100 --> 03:45:20,640
Yeah, baby game.

4535
03:45:23,480 --> 03:45:24,280
Get this guy.

4536
03:45:27,940 --> 03:45:28,340
Yeah,

4537
03:45:31,800 --> 03:45:32,140
that's right.

4538
03:45:34,560 --> 03:45:36,700
Are we going to face off against that guy again?

4539
03:45:36,840 --> 03:45:37,420
Oh my gosh.

4540
03:45:38,780 --> 03:45:39,540
The Kraken?

4541
03:45:48,320 --> 03:45:50,220
Go back and continue the Redfield bloodline.

4542
03:45:59,590 --> 03:46:00,150
Easy.

4543
03:46:08,370 --> 03:46:10,070
Is there anything up there?

4544
03:46:10,330 --> 03:46:12,790
I know it said that there was two guys in here.

4545
03:46:12,890 --> 03:46:13,330
Wait a second.

4546
03:46:16,190 --> 03:46:17,990
I think there's someone behind here.

4547
03:46:19,290 --> 03:46:20,490
Looks pretty flimsy.

4548
03:46:20,750 --> 03:46:21,530
Never mind.

4549
03:46:21,810 --> 03:46:22,390
I lied.

4550
03:46:23,490 --> 03:46:24,050
Here.

4551
03:46:24,310 --> 03:46:25,370
Looks flimsy.

4552
03:46:25,370 --> 03:46:25,710
Your...

4553
03:46:26,530 --> 03:46:27,090
Your...

4554
03:46:27,850 --> 03:46:28,970
Ship is...

4555
03:46:30,310 --> 03:46:30,710
lacking.

4556
03:46:30,750 --> 03:46:31,610
It's a shipwreck.

4557
03:46:34,470 --> 03:46:35,030
Punchy punch.

4558
03:46:45,820 --> 03:46:48,180
Oh, I guess that's our arena down over there, huh?

4559
03:47:02,390 --> 03:47:03,150
There's some coins.

4560
03:47:03,330 --> 03:47:03,790
I'll take that.

4561
03:47:12,070 --> 03:47:13,270
Don't tell her about the boss.

4562
03:47:13,410 --> 03:47:14,190
No, I know there's...

4563
03:47:14,190 --> 03:47:15,750
I know there's two of them.

4564
03:47:16,910 --> 03:47:18,410
I just don't know where they are.

4565
03:47:19,830 --> 03:47:20,550
Looking around.

4566
03:47:21,330 --> 03:47:22,470
Anything that I could have committed?

4567
03:47:23,330 --> 03:47:24,130
Never mind.

4568
03:47:24,210 --> 03:47:24,790
That's where I came from.

4569
03:47:28,130 --> 03:47:29,290
Boss stages don't have secrets?

4570
03:47:29,490 --> 03:47:29,590
Oh.

4571
03:47:29,630 --> 03:47:29,910
Okay.

4572
03:47:37,430 --> 03:47:38,090
Here we go.

4573
03:47:38,950 --> 03:47:39,350
Oh.

4574
03:47:39,550 --> 03:47:40,730
I have two guys...

4575
03:47:40,730 --> 03:47:42,250
Two spirits following me.

4576
03:47:42,330 --> 03:47:42,930
What does this mean?

4577
03:47:43,410 --> 03:47:43,810
Wait.

4578
03:47:43,850 --> 03:47:44,830
What does this mean, actually?

4579
03:47:48,810 --> 03:47:50,130
Not the tentacles!

4580
03:47:51,430 --> 03:47:53,570
Let's see if I have this with the anime called the tentacles.

4581
03:47:53,690 --> 03:47:53,810
No!

4582
03:47:55,350 --> 03:47:56,150
Baku taku!

4583
03:47:57,350 --> 03:47:57,750
Baku taku!

4584
03:47:58,530 --> 03:47:59,390
Oh my gosh.

4585
03:47:59,590 --> 03:47:59,770
Oh!

4586
03:48:00,530 --> 03:48:00,930
Oh!

4587
03:48:01,150 --> 03:48:01,330
Oh!

4588
03:48:01,930 --> 03:48:02,330
Oh!

4589
03:48:02,510 --> 03:48:02,690
Oh!

4590
03:48:04,410 --> 03:48:05,210
That was fast.

4591
03:48:05,370 --> 03:48:05,550
Okay.

4592
03:48:05,630 --> 03:48:06,130
That's fine.

4593
03:48:08,450 --> 03:48:09,170
Oh my gosh.

4594
03:48:16,070 --> 03:48:16,470
Nice!

4595
03:48:18,170 --> 03:48:20,970
That should take care of him a little bit.

4596
03:48:21,170 --> 03:48:22,850
Why does it sound like an elephant?

4597
03:48:47,110 --> 03:48:47,510
And...

4598
03:48:47,510 --> 03:48:47,930
Latch!

4599
03:48:48,990 --> 03:48:49,390
Never

4600
03:49:14,860 --> 03:49:15,040
mind.

4601
03:49:15,140 --> 03:49:15,840
I don't punch there.

4602
03:49:15,960 --> 03:49:16,280
No!

4603
03:49:18,760 --> 03:49:22,600
I thought because it had the symbol, I thought I would punch there to like...

4604
03:49:22,600 --> 03:49:22,720
Oh!

4605
03:49:25,280 --> 03:49:25,820
That's okay.

4606
03:49:26,860 --> 03:49:27,220
Oh!

4607
03:49:27,240 --> 03:49:28,020
You do punch there!

4608
03:49:28,680 --> 03:49:30,260
Must be two hands then, probably.

4609
03:49:31,420 --> 03:49:32,020
Oh my gosh.

4610
03:49:32,860 --> 03:49:33,220
Okay.

4611
03:49:33,260 --> 03:49:34,740
So you get three lives on me.

4612
03:49:35,380 --> 03:49:35,740
Nice.

4613
03:49:52,420 --> 03:49:52,780
Underneath.

4614
03:50:05,750 --> 03:50:06,110
Oh!

4615
03:50:06,130 --> 03:50:08,970
That's why I have the two things behind me.

4616
03:50:09,050 --> 03:50:09,670
I get it now.

4617
03:50:09,950 --> 03:50:14,120
I thought it was for the two robots that I was going to be rescuing.

4618
03:50:14,280 --> 03:50:14,600
Hahaha.

4619
03:50:16,080 --> 03:50:16,440
Oh!

4620
03:50:17,200 --> 03:50:17,560
Oh!

4621
03:50:18,200 --> 03:50:18,280
Oh!

4622
03:50:18,280 --> 03:50:18,380
Oh!

4623
03:50:18,380 --> 03:50:18,420
Oh!

4624
03:50:18,420 --> 03:50:19,420
That was a little bit...

4625
03:50:19,420 --> 03:50:20,280
Man, you can do it.

4626
03:50:30,290 --> 03:50:30,670
Ouch!

4627
03:50:30,870 --> 03:50:31,130
Ouch!

4628
03:50:31,150 --> 03:50:31,330
Ouch!

4629
03:50:31,330 --> 03:50:31,510
Ouch!

4630
03:50:32,290 --> 03:50:33,730
Those ones are hard to avoid.

4631
03:50:35,590 --> 03:50:35,970
Punch!

4632
03:50:36,350 --> 03:50:36,730
Punch!

4633
03:50:36,810 --> 03:50:37,010
Oh!

4634
03:50:37,090 --> 03:50:37,630
Damn it!

4635
03:50:38,090 --> 03:50:38,470
What?

4636
03:50:38,490 --> 03:50:38,690
What?

4637
03:50:38,770 --> 03:50:38,950
What?

4638
03:50:38,950 --> 03:50:39,110
What?

4639
03:50:39,110 --> 03:50:39,270
What?

4640
03:50:39,830 --> 03:50:41,010
How am I supposed to...

4641
03:50:41,010 --> 03:50:42,230
I don't understand that one at all.

4642
03:50:44,890 --> 03:50:45,470
Oh my gosh.

4643
03:50:45,630 --> 03:50:45,910
Oh!

4644
03:51:02,780 --> 03:51:03,160
Okay.

4645
03:51:03,300 --> 03:51:03,460
Okay.

4646
03:51:03,500 --> 03:51:03,620
Okay.

4647
03:51:04,900 --> 03:51:05,660
Punch harder.

4648
03:51:06,040 --> 03:51:06,420
Yeah.

4649
03:51:06,440 --> 03:51:06,620
Yeah.

4650
03:51:07,460 --> 03:51:07,840
Punch harder.

4651
03:51:18,000 --> 03:51:18,960
I dread.

4652
03:51:21,400 --> 03:51:22,040
Uh...

4653
03:51:22,040 --> 03:51:23,240
I dread.

4654
03:51:27,320 --> 03:51:28,480
Also, don't miss.

4655
03:51:28,680 --> 03:51:28,960
Okay.

4656
03:51:29,820 --> 03:51:30,800
Solid advice.

4657
03:51:49,970 --> 03:51:51,250
Under the ground.

4658
03:52:12,610 --> 03:52:13,250
Okay.

4659
03:52:13,270 --> 03:52:14,830
Now this one is when he...

4660
03:52:15,770 --> 03:52:16,090
Okay.

4661
03:52:16,610 --> 03:52:17,510
Sucks up.

4662
03:52:17,570 --> 03:52:18,170
He sucks.

4663
03:52:26,940 --> 03:52:27,580
Okay.

4664
03:52:27,700 --> 03:52:28,040
Nice!

4665
03:52:48,540 --> 03:52:49,320
Oh, oh, so is he.

4666
03:52:49,700 --> 03:52:52,160
Oh, that's how you probably do it faster, huh?

4667
03:53:01,140 --> 03:53:02,320
And this side.

4668
03:53:02,780 --> 03:53:03,080
Concussion!

4669
03:53:03,200 --> 03:53:03,440
Concussion!

4670
03:53:03,560 --> 03:53:03,920
Concussion!

4671
03:53:03,960 --> 03:53:04,340
Concussion!

4672
03:53:04,360 --> 03:53:04,620
Concussion!

4673
03:53:04,620 --> 03:53:04,660
Concussion!

4674
03:53:17,300 --> 03:53:17,740
Yippee!

4675
03:53:30,740 --> 03:53:31,560
Oh my gosh.

4676
03:53:31,720 --> 03:53:32,400
What's happening?

4677
03:53:45,480 --> 03:53:46,780
This is so much.

4678
03:53:46,780 --> 03:53:47,800
I'm scared!

4679
03:53:48,140 --> 03:53:49,360
I'm scared of this part!

4680
03:53:49,880 --> 03:53:51,880
I don't like the sounds it's making!

4681
03:53:52,100 --> 03:53:52,300
Ouch!

4682
03:53:54,180 --> 03:53:55,480
I don't like the sounds!

4683
03:53:55,560 --> 03:53:56,240
I don't like the sounds!

4684
03:53:56,320 --> 03:53:56,620
Like the...

4685
03:53:57,400 --> 03:53:58,240
It's scary.

4686
03:54:45,360 --> 03:54:45,920
Nasty!

4687
03:54:47,160 --> 03:54:49,420
Oh my god, the music finished so perfectly.

4688
03:54:51,300 --> 03:54:51,860
Hey!

4689
03:55:00,120 --> 03:55:00,960
Summer vacation.

4690
03:55:03,400 --> 03:55:04,020
Um...

4691
03:55:04,020 --> 03:55:05,220
What's that?

4692
03:55:06,020 --> 03:55:07,320
A rescue boat?

4693
03:55:13,130 --> 03:55:15,870
This is a... Oh, it's God of War!

4694
03:55:16,350 --> 03:55:17,730
How hard is your head?

4695
03:55:18,250 --> 03:55:20,330
Really, really, really hard.

4696
03:55:22,270 --> 03:55:23,430
And craters!

4697
03:55:27,100 --> 03:55:28,030
I rescued a baby.

4698
03:55:29,250 --> 03:55:30,910
He's just throwing us around.

4699
03:55:32,150 --> 03:55:33,370
John, God of War.

4700
03:55:33,370 --> 03:55:34,330
Yeah, pretty much.

4701
03:55:34,730 --> 03:55:36,430
Alright, hold on tight, little baby!

4702
03:55:37,210 --> 03:55:37,610
Woohoo!

4703
03:55:40,770 --> 03:55:43,490
I love that you can see us flying and like...

4704
03:55:45,550 --> 03:55:46,210
Wobbling around.

4705
03:55:47,670 --> 03:55:48,070
Yay!

4706
03:55:48,210 --> 03:55:48,710
We did it!

4707
03:55:50,390 --> 03:55:50,790
Nice!

4708
03:55:51,110 --> 03:55:51,870
Nice, nice, nice!

4709
03:55:54,150 --> 03:55:54,770
What is that?

4710
03:55:55,010 --> 03:55:55,150
Oh!

4711
03:55:55,770 --> 03:55:57,010
You guys aren't going home with us?

4712
03:55:59,070 --> 03:55:59,930
What did you... Oh!

4713
03:56:00,250 --> 03:56:01,190
Oh, it's a puzzle piece!

4714
03:56:01,450 --> 03:56:01,850
Come here.

4715
03:56:03,430 --> 03:56:04,010
Got it.

4716
03:56:08,010 --> 03:56:08,650
What is this?

4717
03:56:08,930 --> 03:56:09,670
What's the timer?

4718
03:56:09,930 --> 03:56:10,550
What's the timer?

4719
03:56:11,670 --> 03:56:12,110
Oh!

4720
03:56:16,890 --> 03:56:17,330
Interesting.

4721
03:56:18,170 --> 03:56:19,690
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4722
03:56:20,730 --> 03:56:22,190
So I gotta wait for that guy.

4723
03:56:23,230 --> 03:56:24,810
Hey, why didn't you come home with us?

4724
03:56:25,130 --> 03:56:25,470
Well...

4725
03:56:33,220 --> 03:56:34,760
Let's go back and do some catch-up.

4726
03:56:39,340 --> 03:56:40,600
Dive on in.

4727
03:56:43,240 --> 03:56:45,840
Guys, when do I get the more Metal Gears?

4728
03:56:48,580 --> 03:56:49,720
Gotcha time.

4729
03:56:53,280 --> 03:56:54,840
And I need two!

4730
03:56:55,940 --> 03:56:56,820
Let's go.

4731
03:56:58,820 --> 03:56:59,580
And...

4732
03:56:59,580 --> 03:57:00,540
Yay!

4733
03:57:02,260 --> 03:57:03,440
World three.

4734
03:57:03,760 --> 03:57:04,480
Okay.

4735
03:57:05,420 --> 03:57:06,180
Okay.

4736
03:57:06,980 --> 03:57:07,740
Okay.

4737
03:57:07,740 --> 03:57:08,840
Splash my dash.

4738
03:57:08,920 --> 03:57:10,900
The Dual Speeder Garage is open!

4739
03:57:11,120 --> 03:57:14,660
Get in and give your Dual Speeder a whole new look!

4740
03:57:19,780 --> 03:57:21,800
Oh, this must be outfits!

4741
03:57:22,380 --> 03:57:23,900
Oh my gosh.

4742
03:57:25,380 --> 03:57:26,880
Let's go check out our thing.

4743
03:57:29,940 --> 03:57:30,500
No!

4744
03:57:30,860 --> 03:57:32,140
Oh, I only have two colors.

4745
03:57:32,540 --> 03:57:33,000
Wow!

4746
03:57:35,620 --> 03:57:36,180
Fancy.

4747
03:57:37,020 --> 03:57:38,400
Okay, we gotta get more colors.

4748
03:57:38,860 --> 03:57:40,120
This game is huge.

4749
03:57:40,240 --> 03:57:40,980
I know, right?

4750
03:57:41,060 --> 03:57:41,220
I know.

4751
03:57:41,220 --> 03:57:42,860
I mean, I would hope so.

4752
03:57:43,400 --> 03:57:44,340
I mean, I was...

4753
03:57:44,340 --> 03:57:45,360
Cost of like a...

4754
03:57:45,360 --> 03:57:46,260
You know...

4755
03:57:47,220 --> 03:57:47,880
A game.

4756
03:57:48,300 --> 03:57:49,240
Cost of a game.

4757
03:57:54,550 --> 03:57:55,790
We got our gamer.

4758
03:57:56,730 --> 03:57:57,970
Those must be more colors.

4759
03:57:58,050 --> 03:57:58,650
Oh my god.

4760
03:57:59,390 --> 03:58:00,110
Oh my god.

4761
03:58:00,210 --> 03:58:01,430
Oh my god.

4762
03:58:01,450 --> 03:58:02,010
Oh my god!

4763
03:58:02,290 --> 03:58:03,330
Oh my god!

4764
03:58:03,490 --> 03:58:03,710
Oh my god!

4765
03:58:03,710 --> 03:58:04,190
You guys!

4766
03:58:05,630 --> 03:58:06,910
I don't think we're gonna...

4767
03:58:06,910 --> 03:58:08,190
The Rolex Star!

4768
03:58:09,530 --> 03:58:10,410
So cute!

4769
03:58:11,890 --> 03:58:12,850
Sticks to everything.

4770
03:58:13,090 --> 03:58:13,530
Oh my god!

4771
03:58:13,550 --> 03:58:16,590
I don't think we're gonna be able to pull everything, but...

4772
03:58:27,080 --> 03:58:27,820
Irresistible bait!

4773
03:58:32,240 --> 03:58:34,000
I got scammed twice in a row.

4774
03:58:34,600 --> 03:58:35,100
Wow!

4775
03:58:35,520 --> 03:58:36,760
It's so cute!

4776
03:58:39,840 --> 03:58:41,360
Oh, those are all colors.

4777
03:58:42,460 --> 03:58:44,300
I got an uncomfortable couch.

4778
03:58:45,140 --> 03:58:45,640
Okay.

4779
03:58:47,760 --> 03:58:48,260
Wipeout.

4780
03:58:50,400 --> 03:58:50,900
Oh!

4781
03:58:52,460 --> 03:58:54,480
Travel bag and distracting masonry.

4782
03:58:54,740 --> 03:58:56,180
Helps to avoid unwanted attention.

4783
03:58:56,340 --> 03:58:57,140
It's just a prank.

4784
03:58:57,580 --> 03:59:00,160
You can avoid unwanted attention by...

4785
03:59:01,120 --> 03:59:02,140
By murdering them.

4786
03:59:02,440 --> 03:59:03,720
Couldn't sleep so now I'm here.

4787
03:59:03,760 --> 03:59:04,140
Hi everyone.

4788
03:59:04,300 --> 03:59:04,500
Hello!

4789
03:59:05,960 --> 03:59:06,960
Sorry you can't sleep.

4790
03:59:08,860 --> 03:59:09,300
Oh!

4791
03:59:09,460 --> 03:59:09,900
We...

4792
03:59:09,900 --> 03:59:11,540
I got all the stuff for the apes.

4793
03:59:11,600 --> 03:59:12,040
Let's go.

4794
03:59:19,520 --> 03:59:21,400
You don't look so well off as...

4795
03:59:21,400 --> 03:59:21,460
Oh!

4796
03:59:21,700 --> 03:59:22,800
He's like, excuse me.

4797
03:59:23,440 --> 03:59:24,960
I'm trying to figure out this puzzle.

4798
03:59:27,520 --> 03:59:28,740
It's so cute.

4799
03:59:29,660 --> 03:59:30,200
Hahaha!

4800
03:59:31,520 --> 03:59:32,980
It's so cute!

4801
03:59:33,960 --> 03:59:34,980
Cube washer.

4802
03:59:40,100 --> 03:59:40,760
Stressful.

4803
03:59:42,240 --> 03:59:43,880
Looks kind of like Otakon.

4804
03:59:43,920 --> 03:59:44,300
No!

4805
03:59:45,220 --> 03:59:46,960
Game changing relic.

4806
03:59:47,780 --> 03:59:48,440
Whoa!

4807
03:59:48,820 --> 03:59:49,380
Whoa!

4808
03:59:49,720 --> 03:59:50,560
Oh my gosh!

4809
03:59:50,580 --> 03:59:51,160
It's so funny.

4810
03:59:51,580 --> 03:59:52,840
It's just a little...

4811
03:59:52,840 --> 03:59:54,560
A little decoration.

4812
03:59:56,460 --> 03:59:57,380
Paranormal TV!

4813
03:59:58,700 --> 04:00:00,900
Try not to get too sucked in by it.

4814
04:00:00,900 --> 04:00:03,080
The channel's not working though.

4815
04:00:07,880 --> 04:00:09,480
Jade blade and storybook.

4816
04:00:10,760 --> 04:00:11,940
Which one was this again?

4817
04:00:18,310 --> 04:00:19,050
Survival kit.

4818
04:00:19,270 --> 04:00:19,930
Oh my gosh.

4819
04:00:20,010 --> 04:00:21,370
Ellie looks so sad.

4820
04:00:21,550 --> 04:00:23,050
Make enemies quiver in fear.

4821
04:00:23,150 --> 04:00:24,210
I think she's the one quivering.

4822
04:00:24,890 --> 04:00:25,430
Moss.

4823
04:00:25,770 --> 04:00:26,030
Oh.

4824
04:00:27,110 --> 04:00:27,930
Last one.

4825
04:00:28,150 --> 04:00:28,290
Oh!

4826
04:00:29,770 --> 04:00:30,850
Striking scarlet.

4827
04:00:31,090 --> 04:00:32,910
This color's ultra man.

4828
04:00:33,550 --> 04:00:34,090
Hahaha!

4829
04:00:34,090 --> 04:00:34,650
Ultra man!

4830
04:00:39,860 --> 04:00:41,920
I want the ultra man one, I think.

4831
04:00:43,520 --> 04:00:44,520
Wow, our little...

4832
04:00:45,060 --> 04:00:48,400
Our little planet is becoming so lively, isn't it?

4833
04:00:56,580 --> 04:00:57,860
Little big planet.

4834
04:00:59,240 --> 04:00:59,640
Yeah.

4835
04:01:01,180 --> 04:01:02,820
We can grab some more coins.

4836
04:01:02,880 --> 04:01:04,920
I think we'll be able to do one more if we grab these two.

4837
04:01:09,510 --> 04:01:09,910
Yep.

4838
04:01:09,990 --> 04:01:11,150
Okay, let's go do one more.

4839
04:01:11,330 --> 04:01:11,730
Hmm.

4840
04:01:12,770 --> 04:01:13,570
One more.

4841
04:01:13,610 --> 04:01:13,850
Gotcha!

4842
04:01:14,150 --> 04:01:14,670
Hahaha!

4843
04:01:16,490 --> 04:01:17,650
Punch the katamari.

4844
04:01:17,750 --> 04:01:18,690
Oh, I will.

4845
04:01:19,330 --> 04:01:20,390
No, no, no!

4846
04:01:20,650 --> 04:01:21,890
I'm gonna get the Pepsi!

4847
04:01:23,030 --> 04:01:23,590
Oh!

4848
04:01:23,610 --> 04:01:23,770
Oh!

4849
04:01:25,510 --> 04:01:26,390
Shimmering silver.

4850
04:01:26,670 --> 04:01:27,510
Reflects your star...

4851
04:01:27,510 --> 04:01:27,850
Wow!

4852
04:01:30,190 --> 04:01:31,310
So shimmery.

4853
04:01:33,090 --> 04:01:36,730
My first instinct being a VTuber was like, uh-oh.

4854
04:01:37,730 --> 04:01:38,290
Reflection.

4855
04:01:38,550 --> 04:01:38,970
Hahaha!

4856
04:01:39,410 --> 04:01:39,970
Hahaha!

4857
04:01:40,970 --> 04:01:41,710
That was...

4858
04:01:41,730 --> 04:01:42,830
That was my first instinct.

4859
04:02:11,460 --> 04:02:12,720
Let's go see everybody else.

4860
04:02:14,240 --> 04:02:15,000
Oh my gosh.

4861
04:02:15,020 --> 04:02:16,060
This is kind of awful.

4862
04:02:16,820 --> 04:02:17,220
Oh!

4863
04:02:17,380 --> 04:02:17,800
Hahaha!

4864
04:02:18,180 --> 04:02:18,860
It's cosplay!

4865
04:02:19,780 --> 04:02:20,860
I didn't know I'm mean.

4866
04:02:20,920 --> 04:02:21,100
Oh!

4867
04:02:22,020 --> 04:02:23,280
Remember how I mentioned...

4868
04:02:23,280 --> 04:02:23,460
Ah!

4869
04:02:24,220 --> 04:02:25,060
Killing somebody?

4870
04:02:33,700 --> 04:02:34,180
Don't.

4871
04:02:34,460 --> 04:02:35,700
Everybody's got a little thing.

4872
04:02:36,000 --> 04:02:37,080
Look at all these monkeys.

4873
04:02:37,860 --> 04:02:38,340
Oh!

4874
04:02:38,760 --> 04:02:39,240
Oh!

4875
04:02:39,240 --> 04:02:47,120
I wish that the monkeys weren't all just like... you hit them and they just knock off their head and all.

4876
04:02:49,400 --> 04:02:49,980
So...

4877
04:02:49,980 --> 04:02:51,060
Woo!

4878
04:03:00,860 --> 04:03:01,440
Oh!

4879
04:03:01,460 --> 04:03:01,700
Oh!

4880
04:03:02,360 --> 04:03:02,940
Freaky!

4881
04:03:04,240 --> 04:03:04,820
Wow!

4882
04:03:06,300 --> 04:03:06,880
Oh!

4883
04:03:07,800 --> 04:03:08,460
Oh no!

4884
04:03:08,880 --> 04:03:08,940
Oh!

4885
04:03:09,040 --> 04:03:09,320
Hahaha!

4886
04:03:10,860 --> 04:03:11,940
Out of the park.

4887
04:03:12,740 --> 04:03:14,020
This one's so cute.

4888
04:03:14,840 --> 04:03:15,420
Oh!

4889
04:03:15,980 --> 04:03:16,560
Ah!

4890
04:03:16,560 --> 04:03:16,820
Hahaha!

4891
04:03:23,050 --> 04:03:24,050
So cute!

4892
04:03:27,850 --> 04:03:28,930
Oh no, the butterfly.

4893
04:03:30,610 --> 04:03:35,150
Have we tried all of them now, I believe?

4894
04:03:36,470 --> 04:03:37,970
Gosh, these are so cute.

4895
04:03:38,190 --> 04:03:38,770
I can't!

4896
04:03:42,650 --> 04:03:44,650
No, let's go with the Ultraman one.

4897
04:03:45,710 --> 04:03:46,750
It's so awesome.

4898
04:03:47,330 --> 04:03:49,050
I also really like this one, though.

4899
04:03:54,070 --> 04:03:54,590
Oh!

4900
04:03:55,450 --> 04:03:56,230
Can I really make it?

4901
04:03:56,250 --> 04:03:56,730
I really like this one.

4902
04:03:56,810 --> 04:03:57,190
It's a red one.

4903
04:03:57,570 --> 04:03:58,750
If you break it, you buy it.

4904
04:03:58,830 --> 04:03:59,010
No!

4905
04:03:59,910 --> 04:04:00,770
I didn't break anything!

4906
04:04:03,490 --> 04:04:04,890
It looks like gamer stuff.

4907
04:04:05,070 --> 04:04:05,250
What?

4908
04:04:05,350 --> 04:04:06,870
The... the building?

4909
04:04:09,210 --> 04:04:10,750
I think I got all of them now.

4910
04:04:10,930 --> 04:04:11,430
Oh wait.

4911
04:04:22,250 --> 04:04:23,410
Where did you come from?

4912
04:04:23,510 --> 04:04:23,910
Oh my god.

4913
04:04:25,290 --> 04:04:27,010
Oh, I made her angry!

4914
04:04:32,650 --> 04:04:33,950
Oh, she's chasing the chicken.

4915
04:04:34,110 --> 04:04:35,170
That's what's going on.

4916
04:04:35,250 --> 04:04:35,550
Oh!

4917
04:04:38,150 --> 04:04:38,590
They're

4918
04:04:41,880 --> 04:04:42,660
so cute!

4919
04:04:55,360 --> 04:04:57,180
I'm starting to get sleepy, you guys.

4920
04:04:57,300 --> 04:04:57,720
Oh my gosh!

4921
04:04:57,900 --> 04:04:59,420
It's been four hours!

4922
04:05:01,900 --> 04:05:03,980
Well, we completed a whole world too!

4923
04:05:06,360 --> 04:05:07,940
Maybe... Hold on, let's go back in.

4924
04:05:11,960 --> 04:05:16,860
Maybe... Depending... I don't have any plans to super 100% the game.

4925
04:05:20,020 --> 04:05:25,940
But maybe I guess then about three-ish more streams or so.

4926
04:05:28,000 --> 04:05:33,300
Because then we do one... Maybe I can try and do one world per stream.

4927
04:05:38,520 --> 04:05:38,940
Um...

4928
04:05:40,920 --> 04:05:41,340
So...

4929
04:05:42,240 --> 04:05:44,220
Yeah, we'll see.

4930
04:05:44,360 --> 04:05:46,040
Three... or rather four...

4931
04:05:46,040 --> 04:05:48,180
Three more or four more because maybe I'll...

4932
04:05:48,180 --> 04:05:49,440
I don't know.

4933
04:05:49,480 --> 04:05:52,940
I might have so much fun that I just end up trying to 100% it after all.

4934
04:05:54,120 --> 04:05:58,740
And I need to go back and get some guys from like here.

4935
04:05:59,380 --> 04:06:02,060
I'm missing... I'm missing... or puzzle pieces, I mean.

4936
04:06:02,660 --> 04:06:03,840
Am I... I'm missing...

4937
04:06:04,410 --> 04:06:06,540
Yeah, I'm missing... Actually, I'm missing quite a few from here.

4938
04:06:07,500 --> 04:06:07,920
Yeah, I'm missing...

4939
04:06:07,920 --> 04:06:07,920
Actually, I'm missing quite a few from here.

4940
04:06:07,940 --> 04:06:09,600
Aren't all metal gears?

4941
04:06:11,360 --> 04:06:11,760
Yes.

4942
04:06:13,380 --> 04:06:14,840
What am I... I'm missing...

4943
04:06:16,780 --> 04:06:18,640
Where am I... Oh, I'm missing from the triangle?

4944
04:06:18,960 --> 04:06:20,040
Oh... Oh, in here!

4945
04:06:20,200 --> 04:06:21,500
Oh, I'm missing a ton from here.

4946
04:06:23,540 --> 04:06:25,460
Okay, yeah, I gotta do the bot of war.

4947
04:06:26,780 --> 04:06:28,040
I forgot about this one.

4948
04:06:28,120 --> 04:06:29,400
I was like, wow, I'm missing so many.

4949
04:06:29,600 --> 04:06:31,200
Wait, this is all...

4950
04:06:32,700 --> 04:06:34,420
They're all PlayStation characters.

4951
04:06:36,720 --> 04:06:38,460
You'll want to 100% the whole game.

4952
04:06:39,200 --> 04:06:40,900
She's totally gonna 100% this game.

4953
04:06:45,240 --> 04:06:48,280
I'd want to 100% if it weren't aggravating, which this doesn't look.

4954
04:06:48,380 --> 04:06:50,620
No, no, this game is quite forgiving, honestly.

4955
04:06:51,920 --> 04:06:57,840
And it helps that the... even if the boss battles or some of the battles are a little challenging, they're not very long.

4956
04:06:57,980 --> 04:07:03,460
So it's not like... it's not like a chore to get back to where you were, you know?

4957
04:07:04,120 --> 04:07:04,640
Hmm...

4958
04:07:07,540 --> 04:07:08,580
So, yeah...

4959
04:07:09,480 --> 04:07:11,060
This is so fun!

4960
04:07:11,340 --> 04:07:13,880
I hope you guys are enjoying it so far.

4961
04:07:14,180 --> 04:07:15,480
I so much am.

4962
04:07:16,840 --> 04:07:19,720
I'll probably do some more next week as well.

4963
04:07:21,060 --> 04:07:24,720
And yeah, only the symbol stages seem rage-inducing.

4964
04:07:25,300 --> 04:07:28,140
I got through the first two, not so bad.

4965
04:07:28,300 --> 04:07:30,020
But the next two are gonna be... oof.

4966
04:07:30,240 --> 04:07:32,280
Thanks for the comfy stream on my birthday!

4967
04:07:32,280 --> 04:07:33,900
Bria, happy birthday!

4968
04:07:34,420 --> 04:07:35,660
Thank you to you!

4969
04:07:36,500 --> 04:07:39,240
Happy birthday to you!

4970
04:07:40,120 --> 04:07:42,400
Happy birthday to you!

4971
04:07:42,880 --> 04:07:45,700
Happy birthday dear Bria!

4972
04:07:45,900 --> 04:07:47,380
I hope I sang your name right.

4973
04:07:47,920 --> 04:07:51,000
Happy birthday to you!

4974
04:07:53,040 --> 04:07:54,120
Happy birthday!

4975
04:07:54,880 --> 04:07:57,760
I'm also hungry, so I'm gonna go get a little bit of a snack.

4976
04:07:58,000 --> 04:07:59,880
I didn't really have dinner, so...

4977
04:07:59,880 --> 04:08:01,440
Thank you guys again!

4978
04:08:01,440 --> 04:08:05,460
And yeah, I'll see you guys next time...

4979
04:08:06,480 --> 04:08:07,780
When I play!

4980
04:08:08,060 --> 04:08:09,880
Tomorrow I'm playing Metal Gear Solid 3.

4981
04:08:10,460 --> 04:08:11,320
Continuing that.

4982
04:08:12,820 --> 04:08:13,680
And um...

4983
04:08:14,320 --> 04:08:15,320
I want pizza!

4984
04:08:15,640 --> 04:08:17,640
I wish I could remember that the show wasn't too late for pizza.

4985
04:08:19,480 --> 04:08:19,920
Chill!

4986
04:08:20,480 --> 04:08:21,380
Thanks for the fun stream!

4987
04:08:21,500 --> 04:08:25,260
Honestly, 2024 has been a crazy year for VTubers, so I just wanna say thank you for being Minto.

4988
04:08:26,180 --> 04:08:26,620
Yeah!

4989
04:08:26,620 --> 04:08:28,100
Has been a crazy year, huh?

4990
04:08:29,260 --> 04:08:30,180
TryPrincess, thank you!

4991
04:08:30,180 --> 04:08:30,280
Thank you!

4992
04:08:30,800 --> 04:08:32,620
Has been a really crazy year, huh?

4993
04:08:38,100 --> 04:08:38,580
Yeah...

4994
04:08:40,580 --> 04:08:44,740
But, I can say...

4995
04:08:45,320 --> 04:08:47,140
At least for myself...

4996
04:08:47,140 --> 04:08:47,960
Um...

4997
04:08:48,900 --> 04:08:49,380
I...

4998
04:08:49,380 --> 04:08:53,280
I'm very hopeful about things that I'm doing in the future.

4999
04:08:53,940 --> 04:08:56,220
After so much overtime, I finally made it for a livestream.

5000
04:08:57,020 --> 04:08:57,500
JollyRatRotter!

5001
04:08:59,800 --> 04:09:00,720
Thank you!

5002
04:09:00,720 --> 04:09:03,460
Hope to find John A's combat next time.

5003
04:09:04,400 --> 04:09:05,040
Me too.

5004
04:09:07,580 --> 04:09:08,300
Um...

5005
04:09:08,300 --> 04:09:09,720
Hmm...

5006
04:09:09,720 --> 04:09:10,980
You know...

5007
04:09:12,280 --> 04:09:13,000
Um...

5008
04:09:13,580 --> 04:09:14,700
I hope that...

5009
04:09:15,400 --> 04:09:15,760
Uh...

5010
04:09:15,760 --> 04:09:16,480
You know...

5011
04:09:16,480 --> 04:09:19,380
Despite there having been so many...

5012
04:09:21,200 --> 04:09:23,000
I guess strange?

5013
04:09:23,500 --> 04:09:23,900
Uh...

5014
04:09:23,900 --> 04:09:24,620
So many changes?

5015
04:09:25,520 --> 04:09:26,860
So many changes...

5016
04:09:26,860 --> 04:09:28,420
I was gonna say strange things...

5017
04:09:28,420 --> 04:09:28,920
I mean...

5018
04:09:28,920 --> 04:09:31,140
The whole concept of VTubers is strange.

5019
04:09:31,460 --> 04:09:31,700
But...

5020
04:09:31,700 --> 04:09:35,280
Despite so many changes, I hope that you guys still feel...

5021
04:09:35,280 --> 04:09:35,840
Um...

5022
04:09:35,840 --> 04:09:37,360
Excited about...

5023
04:09:37,360 --> 04:09:39,580
Following VTubers and...

5024
04:09:39,580 --> 04:09:40,280
Um...

5025
04:09:40,280 --> 04:09:40,780
You know...

5026
04:09:40,780 --> 04:09:41,940
I hope that...

5027
04:09:41,940 --> 04:09:43,760
It hasn't really...

5028
04:09:43,760 --> 04:09:44,300
You know...

5029
04:09:45,880 --> 04:09:46,520
When...

5030
04:09:46,520 --> 04:09:47,800
Things like this happen...

5031
04:09:47,800 --> 04:09:49,680
The first thing I think about are just like...

5032
04:09:49,680 --> 04:09:51,160
How the fans...

5033
04:09:51,680 --> 04:09:52,320
Are...

5034
04:09:52,320 --> 04:09:53,200
And if they're okay...

5035
04:09:54,220 --> 04:09:54,860
Cause...

5036
04:09:54,860 --> 04:09:55,780
You know...

5037
04:09:56,660 --> 04:09:57,300
It...

5038
04:09:57,300 --> 04:09:57,900
It is...

5039
04:09:58,860 --> 04:09:59,720
It's not...

5040
04:09:59,720 --> 04:10:00,840
It's not...

5041
04:10:00,840 --> 04:10:02,200
It's not an ideal situation...

5042
04:10:02,200 --> 04:10:02,760
So...

5043
04:10:02,760 --> 04:10:04,420
I just hope that...

5044
04:10:05,100 --> 04:10:06,480
Everybody is okay...

5045
04:10:07,820 --> 04:10:08,320
And...

5046
04:10:08,320 --> 04:10:10,220
Especially in this situation...

5047
04:10:10,220 --> 04:10:11,100
It's a lot of...

5048
04:10:11,100 --> 04:10:11,820
It's a little bit...

5049
04:10:11,820 --> 04:10:13,160
It feels like a little bit of limbo...

5050
04:10:13,900 --> 04:10:14,400
Um...

5051
04:10:14,400 --> 04:10:16,200
Since everybody is kinda confused...

5052
04:10:17,480 --> 04:10:17,980
Um...

5053
04:10:18,580 --> 04:10:20,460
About what's going on...

5054
04:10:22,540 --> 04:10:23,040
Uh...

5055
04:10:23,640 --> 04:10:24,140
But...

5056
04:10:25,120 --> 04:10:25,620
Uh...

5057
04:10:25,620 --> 04:10:27,060
I think from...

5058
04:10:27,060 --> 04:10:27,880
I was watching her stream...

5059
04:10:27,880 --> 04:10:28,500
Earlier...

5060
04:10:29,860 --> 04:10:31,420
It doesn't seem so...

5061
04:10:32,540 --> 04:10:33,020
Negative...

5062
04:10:34,660 --> 04:10:35,380
And uh...

5063
04:10:35,380 --> 04:10:36,800
I think about...

5064
04:10:37,340 --> 04:10:37,820
Um...

5065
04:10:38,900 --> 04:10:39,600
I guess...

5066
04:10:39,600 --> 04:10:40,860
I don't know if it really applies...

5067
04:10:40,860 --> 04:10:41,920
In this situation...

5068
04:10:41,920 --> 04:10:42,660
But...

5069
04:10:43,880 --> 04:10:44,360
Um...

5070
04:10:46,180 --> 04:10:46,660
How...

5071
04:10:47,840 --> 04:10:48,320
Uh...

5072
04:10:48,320 --> 04:10:48,660
Maybe...

5073
04:10:48,660 --> 04:10:49,580
Maybe it doesn't apply...

5074
04:10:49,580 --> 04:10:50,500
Maybe I won't bring it up...

5075
04:10:51,540 --> 04:10:52,740
There was something that...

5076
04:10:52,740 --> 04:10:53,360
An idol...

5077
04:10:53,360 --> 04:10:54,140
Oshii of mine...

5078
04:10:54,140 --> 04:10:55,620
Brought up before...

5079
04:10:55,620 --> 04:10:57,120
But I don't think it really applies here...

5080
04:10:57,120 --> 04:10:57,860
Though...

5081
04:10:57,860 --> 04:10:58,600
I just say it because...

5082
04:10:58,600 --> 04:10:59,880
It was when she announced...

5083
04:10:59,880 --> 04:11:01,060
Her graduation...

5084
04:11:01,060 --> 04:11:01,600
That she kind of...

5085
04:11:01,600 --> 04:11:02,460
Talked about it...

5086
04:11:02,460 --> 04:11:03,220
But...

5087
04:11:03,220 --> 04:11:03,720
Um...

5088
04:11:05,960 --> 04:11:06,600
Uh...

5089
04:11:08,560 --> 04:11:09,500
I just...

5090
04:11:09,500 --> 04:11:10,000
You know...

5091
04:11:10,000 --> 04:11:11,960
Speaking from experience...

5092
04:11:11,960 --> 04:11:13,760
When someone makes...

5093
04:11:13,760 --> 04:11:15,420
A decision like this...

5094
04:11:15,420 --> 04:11:17,480
It's not easy...

5095
04:11:17,480 --> 04:11:19,560
And it's...

5096
04:11:20,340 --> 04:11:21,840
It's honestly like...

5097
04:11:21,840 --> 04:11:22,120
Uh...

5098
04:11:22,120 --> 04:11:22,700
It feels like...

5099
04:11:22,700 --> 04:11:23,680
Uh...

5100
04:11:25,000 --> 04:11:25,640
Um...

5101
04:11:25,640 --> 04:11:27,840
I wouldn't say a last resort...

5102
04:11:27,860 --> 04:11:28,420
But...

5103
04:11:29,420 --> 04:11:30,440
You know...

5104
04:11:30,440 --> 04:11:31,360
It has...

5105
04:11:31,360 --> 04:11:32,000
It's like...

5106
04:11:32,000 --> 04:11:32,500
Okay...

5107
04:11:32,500 --> 04:11:34,540
This is truly what's best for me...

5108
04:11:34,540 --> 04:11:35,040
And so...

5109
04:11:35,040 --> 04:11:36,220
You know...

5110
04:11:36,220 --> 04:11:37,020
Um...

5111
04:11:38,180 --> 04:11:39,160
That's why...

5112
04:11:39,160 --> 04:11:39,580
You know...

5113
04:11:39,580 --> 04:11:41,180
Trust in your Oshii...

5114
04:11:41,180 --> 04:11:42,600
Believe in your Oshii...

5115
04:11:42,600 --> 04:11:43,420
That...

5116
04:11:43,420 --> 04:11:46,160
They're doing what's best for themselves...

5117
04:11:46,160 --> 04:11:47,080
And...

5118
04:11:47,080 --> 04:11:48,060
I know it hurts...

5119
04:11:48,060 --> 04:11:50,020
I know it's really hard...

5120
04:11:50,020 --> 04:11:51,040
Especially to...

5121
04:11:51,840 --> 04:11:52,580
Um...

5122
04:11:52,580 --> 04:11:53,340
Accept...

5123
04:11:53,340 --> 04:11:54,120
As a teammate...

5124
04:11:54,120 --> 04:11:55,060
Your streams helped today...

5125
04:11:55,060 --> 04:11:55,540
Minto...

5126
04:11:55,540 --> 04:11:57,280
I'm glad...

5127
04:11:57,280 --> 04:11:57,840
Thank you...

5128
04:11:57,860 --> 04:11:58,800
Um...

5129
04:11:59,980 --> 04:12:01,080
To be honest...

5130
04:12:01,080 --> 04:12:02,600
I'm just so sad about it...

5131
04:12:03,460 --> 04:12:04,140
Um...

5132
04:12:04,140 --> 04:12:05,420
But...

5133
04:12:05,420 --> 04:12:05,820
Like...

5134
04:12:05,820 --> 04:12:06,640
I don't wanna...

5135
04:12:06,640 --> 04:12:07,180
Um...

5136
04:12:07,180 --> 04:12:07,840
I...

5137
04:12:07,840 --> 04:12:09,080
I can't imagine how...

5138
04:12:09,080 --> 04:12:11,140
The members themselves are feeling...

5139
04:12:11,140 --> 04:12:11,820
So...

5140
04:12:16,000 --> 04:12:16,680
But...

5141
04:12:16,680 --> 04:12:18,480
Right now...

5142
04:12:18,480 --> 04:12:19,540
Right now...

5143
04:12:19,540 --> 04:12:20,920
She needs...

5144
04:12:22,640 --> 04:12:24,120
Support from everybody...

5145
04:12:24,120 --> 04:12:24,740
And...

5146
04:12:24,740 --> 04:12:25,160
I know...

5147
04:12:25,160 --> 04:12:26,860
That everybody is giving that to her...

5148
04:12:26,860 --> 04:12:27,760
And...

5149
04:12:27,760 --> 04:12:28,620
Um...

5150
04:12:28,620 --> 04:12:29,840
Just always one of those reminders...

5151
04:12:29,840 --> 04:12:29,880
Like...

5152
04:12:29,900 --> 04:12:30,420
To...

5153
04:12:30,420 --> 04:12:31,460
Um...

5154
04:12:31,460 --> 04:12:32,260
Cherish...

5155
04:12:32,690 --> 04:12:33,740
The times...

5156
04:12:33,740 --> 04:12:34,840
That are fun...

5157
04:12:34,840 --> 04:12:36,180
The times...

5158
04:12:36,180 --> 04:12:36,600
You know...

5159
04:12:36,600 --> 04:12:37,340
With Hiroshi...

5160
04:12:37,340 --> 04:12:37,680
And...

5161
04:12:37,680 --> 04:12:38,520
Um...

5162
04:12:38,520 --> 04:12:39,800
All those fun memories...

5163
04:12:39,800 --> 04:12:40,860
That you made with her...

5164
04:12:40,860 --> 04:12:41,140
Are...

5165
04:12:41,140 --> 04:12:42,720
Always going to stay...

5166
04:12:42,720 --> 04:12:44,520
And you can always look back...

5167
04:12:44,520 --> 04:12:44,660
And...

5168
04:12:44,660 --> 04:12:46,460
Think how fondly...

5169
04:12:46,460 --> 04:12:47,220
You know...

5170
04:12:47,900 --> 04:12:48,460
Especially...

5171
04:12:48,460 --> 04:12:49,300
With...

5172
04:12:49,570 --> 04:12:50,320
With Myth...

5173
04:12:50,320 --> 04:12:51,640
How much they...

5174
04:12:51,640 --> 04:12:52,780
Um...

5175
04:12:53,640 --> 04:12:54,050
Made...

5176
04:12:54,460 --> 04:12:55,300
Covid...

5177
04:12:55,300 --> 04:12:56,180
So much less...

5178
04:12:56,180 --> 04:12:56,960
Lonely...

5179
04:12:56,960 --> 04:12:59,760
I'm very grateful for that...

5180
04:12:59,760 --> 04:12:59,880
And...

5181
04:13:00,700 --> 04:13:01,080
Uh...

5182
04:13:03,280 --> 04:13:04,860
We got all those...

5183
04:13:04,860 --> 04:13:05,380
We were...

5184
04:13:05,380 --> 04:13:06,240
We were really lucky...

5185
04:13:06,240 --> 04:13:07,020
To have...

5186
04:13:07,020 --> 04:13:07,900
As much time...

5187
04:13:07,900 --> 04:13:09,180
With her...

5188
04:13:09,180 --> 04:13:09,640
As we did...

5189
04:13:09,640 --> 04:13:09,960
So...

5190
04:13:11,020 --> 04:13:11,780
And...

5191
04:13:11,780 --> 04:13:12,360
Uh...

5192
04:13:12,360 --> 04:13:12,740
Hopefully...

5193
04:13:12,740 --> 04:13:13,600
We see her again...

5194
04:13:13,600 --> 04:13:13,980
Somehow...

5195
04:13:14,680 --> 04:13:15,880
In another capacity...

5196
04:13:16,680 --> 04:13:17,440
Whatever...

5197
04:13:17,440 --> 04:13:18,520
She does...

5198
04:13:18,520 --> 04:13:19,500
Uh...

5199
04:13:19,500 --> 04:13:21,140
Since it's kind of vague...

5200
04:13:21,140 --> 04:13:22,640
Yeah...

5201
04:13:26,380 --> 04:13:27,140
And...

5202
04:13:27,140 --> 04:13:28,260
Of course...

5203
04:13:28,260 --> 04:13:29,060
You know...

5204
04:13:29,060 --> 04:13:29,860
You know...

5205
04:13:30,860 --> 04:13:31,820
One thing...

5206
04:13:31,820 --> 04:13:32,640
As well is...

5207
04:13:32,640 --> 04:13:33,880
Things have to change...

5208
04:13:33,880 --> 04:13:35,140
To move forward...

5209
04:13:35,140 --> 04:13:36,160
So...

5210
04:13:36,160 --> 04:13:37,660
We can also look forward to...

5211
04:13:37,660 --> 04:13:40,000
All the fun things that will happen in the future...

5212
04:13:40,000 --> 04:13:42,380
All the fun events that will be happening...

5213
04:13:42,380 --> 04:13:43,540
And...

5214
04:13:43,540 --> 04:13:44,000
Um...

5215
04:13:44,000 --> 04:13:45,320
New people that we'll meet...

5216
04:13:45,320 --> 04:13:46,380
And...

5217
04:13:47,520 --> 04:13:48,540
Everything that...

5218
04:13:48,540 --> 04:13:49,000
That...

5219
04:13:49,000 --> 04:13:50,020
You know...

5220
04:13:50,020 --> 04:13:51,520
Comes with...

5221
04:13:51,520 --> 04:13:53,140
Moving forward and...

5222
04:13:53,140 --> 04:13:54,780
Having things change...

5223
04:13:54,780 --> 04:13:55,420
In our...

5224
04:13:55,420 --> 04:13:56,160
Lives...

5225
04:13:56,160 --> 04:13:57,960
And after lives...

5226
04:13:58,720 --> 04:13:59,320
Yeah...

5227
04:13:59,320 --> 04:13:59,860
So...

5228
04:13:59,880 --> 04:14:00,900
You know...

5229
04:14:03,140 --> 04:14:05,260
I do hate saying goodbyes though...

5230
04:14:06,820 --> 04:14:09,080
It's one of my least favorite things ever...

5231
04:14:14,030 --> 04:14:14,590
And...

5232
04:14:14,590 --> 04:14:15,170
I have...

5233
04:14:15,170 --> 04:14:16,310
I have full...

5234
04:14:16,310 --> 04:14:16,810
Like...

5235
04:14:16,810 --> 04:14:17,210
Uh...

5236
04:14:18,370 --> 04:14:19,190
I guess...

5237
04:14:19,190 --> 04:14:20,230
Faith in her...

5238
04:14:20,230 --> 04:14:21,270
I know that she's...

5239
04:14:21,270 --> 04:14:23,370
Got such a good head on her shoulders...

5240
04:14:23,370 --> 04:14:23,890
She's so...

5241
04:14:23,890 --> 04:14:24,450
Talented...

5242
04:14:24,450 --> 04:14:25,810
She's so...

5243
04:14:25,810 --> 04:14:27,110
So creative...

5244
04:14:27,110 --> 04:14:27,790
So everything...

5245
04:14:27,790 --> 04:14:28,090
You know...

5246
04:14:28,090 --> 04:14:28,770
We all know that...

5247
04:14:28,770 --> 04:14:30,010
These traits about her...

5248
04:14:30,010 --> 04:14:30,330
So...

5249
04:14:30,330 --> 04:14:31,210
Whatever she...

5250
04:14:31,210 --> 04:14:31,230
Is...

5251
04:14:31,250 --> 04:14:32,410
Decides to do...

5252
04:14:32,410 --> 04:14:33,050
Will be...

5253
04:14:33,050 --> 04:14:33,750
Really...

5254
04:14:33,750 --> 04:14:34,470
Really awesome...

5255
04:14:34,470 --> 04:14:34,970
And...

5256
04:14:34,970 --> 04:14:36,470
I hope it all works out for her...

5257
04:14:36,470 --> 04:14:37,090
Cooper!

5258
04:14:37,250 --> 04:14:38,130
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

5259
04:14:39,810 --> 04:14:41,050
It doesn't have to be goodbye...

5260
04:14:41,050 --> 04:14:42,070
It can be a bon voyage...

5261
04:14:42,070 --> 04:14:42,550
Yeah...

5262
04:14:43,350 --> 04:14:43,790
Exactly...

5263
04:14:44,490 --> 04:14:44,930
No...

5264
04:14:44,930 --> 04:14:46,830
VTuber should stay the same forever...

5265
04:14:46,830 --> 04:14:49,310
But if things stay the same forever...

5266
04:14:49,310 --> 04:14:51,390
You can't ever appreciate the things...

5267
04:14:51,390 --> 04:14:52,210
You know?

5268
04:14:53,330 --> 04:14:55,430
But I don't want to say goodbye to yesterday...

5269
04:14:57,110 --> 04:14:58,190
We have to...

5270
04:14:58,190 --> 04:14:59,390
We have to...

5271
04:14:59,390 --> 04:15:00,690
Say bye to things...

5272
04:15:00,690 --> 04:15:01,230
To be able to...

5273
04:15:01,250 --> 04:15:02,130
To appreciate...

5274
04:15:02,130 --> 04:15:03,410
Why we...

5275
04:15:03,410 --> 04:15:04,410
Love those things...

5276
04:15:04,410 --> 04:15:05,050
To begin with...

5277
04:15:05,050 --> 04:15:05,290
You know?

5278
04:15:07,270 --> 04:15:07,730
Otherwise...

5279
04:15:07,730 --> 04:15:10,090
Otherwise if things stay the same forever...

5280
04:15:10,090 --> 04:15:10,570
You'll just...

5281
04:15:10,570 --> 04:15:11,810
Kind of get bored of it...

5282
04:15:11,810 --> 04:15:12,030
Right?

5283
04:15:12,870 --> 04:15:13,330
You'll...

5284
04:15:13,330 --> 04:15:13,970
End up...

5285
04:15:13,970 --> 04:15:14,410
You'll be like...

5286
04:15:14,410 --> 04:15:14,950
This is fun!

5287
04:15:15,050 --> 04:15:15,610
This is fun!

5288
04:15:15,750 --> 04:15:16,170
And...

5289
04:15:17,750 --> 04:15:18,430
You know...

5290
04:15:18,430 --> 04:15:19,490
Eventually you'll be like...

5291
04:15:19,490 --> 04:15:20,050
Oh...

5292
04:15:21,190 --> 04:15:22,130
I don't know...

5293
04:15:25,800 --> 04:15:27,940
I never knew how much fun it was...

5294
04:15:31,440 --> 04:15:32,240
So yeah...

5295
04:15:32,240 --> 04:15:33,360
See you next time!

5296
04:15:33,440 --> 04:15:33,800
Bye!

5297
04:15:33,860 --> 04:15:35,560
Stay strong, teammates!

5298
04:15:38,060 --> 04:15:38,600
And...

5299
04:15:39,240 --> 04:15:40,520
Give her lots of support!

5300
04:15:43,740 --> 04:15:45,280
Thank you, Mr. Sante!

5301
04:15:45,340 --> 04:15:46,280
I needed to hear this!

5302
04:15:46,520 --> 04:15:47,060
Yeah!

5303
04:15:49,620 --> 04:15:51,100
Of course it sucks!

5304
04:15:51,400 --> 04:15:52,180
And you're...

5305
04:15:52,180 --> 04:15:53,540
Totally valid in...

5306
04:15:53,540 --> 04:15:54,640
Feeling sad...

5307
04:15:54,640 --> 04:15:55,620
You know?

5308
04:15:55,700 --> 04:15:57,680
So don't feel like you have to be like...

5309
04:15:57,680 --> 04:15:58,780
So happy positive!

5310
04:15:58,980 --> 04:16:00,420
It's okay to feel your feelings!

5311
04:16:02,800 --> 04:16:03,840
No matter what they say...

5312
04:16:03,860 --> 04:16:05,500
And don't let people discredit that!

5313
04:16:05,600 --> 04:16:06,960
Don't let people say like...

5314
04:16:06,960 --> 04:16:07,620
Oh, you should be...

5315
04:16:07,620 --> 04:16:09,340
Thinking this way or that way...

5316
04:16:12,680 --> 04:16:14,220
You're totally valid in...

5317
04:16:14,220 --> 04:16:14,940
You know...

5318
04:16:14,940 --> 04:16:17,760
Even to people that don't understand VTubers...

5319
04:16:17,760 --> 04:16:18,140
You know?

5320
04:16:18,160 --> 04:16:18,380
Or...

5321
04:16:18,380 --> 04:16:19,440
Understand VTubers...

5322
04:16:19,440 --> 04:16:20,900
To people that don't understand VTubers...

5323
04:16:20,900 --> 04:16:21,080
You know?

5324
04:16:21,120 --> 04:16:22,140
There's always that discussion...

5325
04:16:22,140 --> 04:16:22,540
They're like...

5326
04:16:22,540 --> 04:16:23,860
People could treat...

5327
04:16:23,860 --> 04:16:25,260
I know this isn't a graduation...

5328
04:16:25,260 --> 04:16:25,860
But they're like...

5329
04:16:25,860 --> 04:16:29,420
People treat VTubers leaving their graduations as like they're dying!

5330
04:16:30,260 --> 04:16:30,740
But...

5331
04:16:31,620 --> 04:16:32,200
You know?

5332
04:16:32,320 --> 04:16:32,800
It's...

5333
04:16:33,360 --> 04:16:33,840
It's...

5334
04:16:33,840 --> 04:16:35,080
It's not the same...

5335
04:16:36,020 --> 04:16:36,580
When...

5336
04:16:36,580 --> 04:16:37,920
Someone leaves...

5337
04:16:39,600 --> 04:16:40,160
Uh...

5338
04:16:40,160 --> 04:16:40,520
You're...

5339
04:16:40,520 --> 04:16:41,640
You're leaving...

5340
04:16:41,640 --> 04:16:42,980
They're leaving a whole...

5341
04:16:42,980 --> 04:16:43,760
Like...

5342
04:16:45,320 --> 04:16:47,120
Group of people...

5343
04:16:47,120 --> 04:16:48,040
A whole...

5344
04:16:48,680 --> 04:16:49,240
Uh...

5345
04:16:49,240 --> 04:16:51,960
You don't get those same interactions anymore?

5346
04:16:52,200 --> 04:16:52,700
Like...

5347
04:16:52,700 --> 04:16:53,180
It's...

5348
04:16:55,380 --> 04:16:57,120
It is like a character is dying!

5349
04:16:57,200 --> 04:16:57,400
Yeah!

5350
04:16:58,020 --> 04:16:58,580
Essentially...

5351
04:16:58,580 --> 04:16:59,940
Thank you Mint for being here!

5352
04:16:59,980 --> 04:17:01,980
Anime MYC made me want to start watching you again!

5353
04:17:02,340 --> 04:17:03,720
Sorry I didn't go to the concert!

5354
04:17:03,720 --> 04:17:03,820
I'm sorry!

5355
04:17:06,180 --> 04:17:07,860
Thank you so much!

5356
04:17:07,940 --> 04:17:09,040
Happy to have you here!

5357
04:17:15,320 --> 04:17:16,360
Someone once told me...

5358
04:17:16,360 --> 04:17:17,480
If nothing breaks, nothing moves.

5359
04:17:17,560 --> 04:17:19,120
And it took me a long time to understand it...

5360
04:17:19,120 --> 04:17:20,500
But I think about it a lot nowadays.

5361
04:17:20,720 --> 04:17:20,900
Yeah!

5362
04:17:22,140 --> 04:17:23,060
I think...

5363
04:17:23,060 --> 04:17:23,340
You know...

5364
04:17:24,780 --> 04:17:25,240
As...

5365
04:17:26,060 --> 04:17:26,980
Sad as...

5366
04:17:27,940 --> 04:17:28,740
It is...

5367
04:17:28,740 --> 04:17:29,400
To say...

5368
04:17:29,400 --> 04:17:29,920
You know...

5369
04:17:29,920 --> 04:17:30,820
Goodbye to...

5370
04:17:30,820 --> 04:17:32,000
Certain things...

5371
04:17:33,760 --> 04:17:34,220
Um...

5372
04:17:35,280 --> 04:17:36,820
It's exciting to look forward to...

5373
04:17:36,820 --> 04:17:38,180
What will come next...

5374
04:17:40,600 --> 04:17:41,360
So...

5375
04:17:41,360 --> 04:17:42,480
Hmm...

5376
04:17:42,480 --> 04:17:43,460
And through...

5377
04:17:43,460 --> 04:17:44,960
Through strife...

5378
04:17:44,960 --> 04:17:45,640
Comes innovation!

5379
04:17:46,340 --> 04:17:47,240
You know?

5380
04:17:48,260 --> 04:17:49,020
And...

5381
04:17:49,020 --> 04:17:49,240
Uh...

5382
04:17:49,240 --> 04:17:50,400
Not only giving...

5383
04:17:50,400 --> 04:17:51,340
You know...

5384
04:17:51,340 --> 04:17:52,340
Amelia...

5385
04:17:52,340 --> 04:17:53,100
Her support...

5386
04:17:53,100 --> 04:17:53,800
But also...

5387
04:17:53,800 --> 04:17:54,760
The Myth members...

5388
04:17:54,760 --> 04:17:55,480
All the other...

5389
04:17:55,480 --> 04:17:57,020
Hollow Iyan members...

5390
04:17:57,020 --> 04:17:58,900
I'm sure they're kind of all feeling...

5391
04:17:59,940 --> 04:18:00,700
Um...

5392
04:18:00,700 --> 04:18:02,100
A lot right now...

5393
04:18:02,100 --> 04:18:03,320
So...

5394
04:18:03,320 --> 04:18:04,200
Hmm...

5395
04:18:04,200 --> 04:18:04,900
Let's just...

5396
04:18:04,900 --> 04:18:05,140
Uh...

5397
04:18:05,140 --> 04:18:06,560
All be really supportive...

5398
04:18:06,560 --> 04:18:06,760
And...

5399
04:18:06,760 --> 04:18:06,800
You know...

5400
04:18:06,800 --> 04:18:08,580
All emotions are valid...

5401
04:18:08,580 --> 04:18:09,200
While mourning...

5402
04:18:09,200 --> 04:18:10,200
People go through it...

5403
04:18:10,200 --> 04:18:10,900
In their own ways...

5404
04:18:10,900 --> 04:18:11,640
So don't feel ashamed...

5405
04:18:11,640 --> 04:18:12,460
Of feeling certain ways...

5406
04:18:12,460 --> 04:18:12,900
Exactly!

5407
04:18:13,060 --> 04:18:13,440
Exactly!

5408
04:18:15,840 --> 04:18:16,780
Tough time...

5409
04:18:16,780 --> 04:18:17,660
Never lasts...

5410
04:18:17,660 --> 04:18:19,200
Only tough people...

5411
04:18:19,200 --> 04:18:19,840
Last...

5412
04:18:28,880 --> 04:18:30,480
I can't say that...

5413
04:18:30,480 --> 04:18:30,980
You know...

5414
04:18:30,980 --> 04:18:31,580
My...

5415
04:18:31,580 --> 04:18:32,420
Situation...

5416
04:18:32,420 --> 04:18:33,460
Is the same as hers...

5417
04:18:34,040 --> 04:18:34,560
Obviously...

5418
04:18:34,560 --> 04:18:35,280
By having...

5419
04:18:35,280 --> 04:18:35,540
You know...

5420
04:18:35,540 --> 04:18:36,700
Done similar stuff...

5421
04:18:36,700 --> 04:18:36,780
But...

5422
04:18:37,900 --> 04:18:38,380
It's...

5423
04:18:39,500 --> 04:18:40,780
It's really hard...

5424
04:18:42,320 --> 04:18:44,280
It's like the hardest decision...

5425
04:18:59,650 --> 04:19:01,010
I was feeling...

5426
04:19:01,010 --> 04:19:01,450
You know...

5427
04:19:01,450 --> 04:19:02,990
I couldn't sleep at all last night...

5428
04:19:02,990 --> 04:19:04,270
Really much...

5429
04:19:04,270 --> 04:19:04,950
Because of...

5430
04:19:04,950 --> 04:19:05,990
I saw it...

5431
04:19:05,990 --> 04:19:06,710
Right before I went...

5432
04:19:06,710 --> 04:19:07,390
Like the announcement...

5433
04:19:07,390 --> 04:19:08,250
Right before I went to bed...

5434
04:19:08,250 --> 04:19:09,150
And I was like...

5435
04:19:09,150 --> 04:19:10,510
I was just up...

5436
04:19:10,510 --> 04:19:11,370
You know...

5437
04:19:11,950 --> 04:19:13,650
Just thinking about so many things...

5438
04:19:13,650 --> 04:19:14,650
Like I was like...

5439
04:19:14,650 --> 04:19:16,490
Thinking about all the fans...

5440
04:19:16,490 --> 04:19:17,390
And I was thinking about...

5441
04:19:17,390 --> 04:19:18,230
All the members...

5442
04:19:18,230 --> 04:19:18,810
And I was...

5443
04:19:18,830 --> 04:19:20,130
Thinking about...

5444
04:19:20,950 --> 04:19:22,510
My own situation...

5445
04:19:22,510 --> 04:19:24,330
And I was just feeling...

5446
04:19:24,330 --> 04:19:24,890
Uh...

5447
04:19:26,030 --> 04:19:27,370
Like a deja vu...

5448
04:19:28,830 --> 04:19:29,550
It like...

5449
04:19:29,550 --> 04:19:31,410
Brought so many feelings back to me...

5450
04:19:33,470 --> 04:19:34,510
So I was like...

5451
04:19:34,510 --> 04:19:35,070
Whoa...

5452
04:19:35,850 --> 04:19:36,290
Whoa...

5453
04:19:37,290 --> 04:19:39,490
Not necessarily good feelings...

5454
04:19:39,490 --> 04:19:39,810
You know...

5455
04:19:39,810 --> 04:19:40,590
So it's like...

5456
04:19:40,590 --> 04:19:42,450
I was listening to an archive of one of your karaoke...

5457
04:19:42,450 --> 04:19:43,230
When I beat a boss...

5458
04:19:43,230 --> 04:19:44,390
I was struggling with an Elden Ring...

5459
04:19:44,390 --> 04:19:44,750
Cheers!

5460
04:19:44,810 --> 04:19:45,390
A bito!

5461
04:19:45,590 --> 04:19:46,030
Wow!

5462
04:19:46,250 --> 04:19:47,210
Congrats Lali!

5463
04:19:47,510 --> 04:19:48,130
You know...

5464
04:19:48,130 --> 04:19:48,810
I was like...

5465
04:19:50,690 --> 04:19:51,310
Lali-pop!

5466
04:19:51,570 --> 04:19:52,250
Lali-pop!

5467
04:19:52,410 --> 04:19:52,550
Oh!

5468
04:19:52,950 --> 04:19:54,750
Lali-la-la-la-la-la-la-lali-pop!

5469
04:19:55,050 --> 04:19:55,730
Lali-pop!

5470
04:19:55,730 --> 04:19:55,930
Oh!

5471
04:19:56,230 --> 04:19:57,330
Lali-la-la-la-la-la-la-lali-pop!

5472
04:20:04,190 --> 04:20:04,550
Yeah!

5473
04:20:05,710 --> 04:20:06,070
So...

5474
04:20:06,610 --> 04:20:06,970
Uh...

5475
04:20:09,590 --> 04:20:09,950
Yeah!

5476
04:20:10,370 --> 04:20:12,150
I hope you guys are feeling okay...

5477
04:20:13,950 --> 04:20:14,310
And...

5478
04:20:14,310 --> 04:20:14,950
Yeah...

5479
04:20:22,200 --> 04:20:22,560
Sorry...

5480
04:20:22,560 --> 04:20:24,560
I didn't mean to talk so much about it...

5481
04:20:25,420 --> 04:20:27,240
I didn't mean to talk so much about it...

5482
04:20:27,240 --> 04:20:27,880
Okay!

5483
04:20:28,160 --> 04:20:30,080
Thank you guys for hanging out with me!

5484
04:20:30,180 --> 04:20:30,400
Bye!

5485
04:20:30,980 --> 04:20:32,200
I will see you guys...

5486
04:20:32,200 --> 04:20:33,860
When I see you next...

5487
04:20:34,300 --> 04:20:34,720
Atsumita!

5488
04:20:35,460 --> 04:20:36,500
Have a good day!

5489
04:20:36,500 --> 04:20:37,260
Have a good night!

5490
04:20:38,220 --> 04:20:38,640
Ittarashou!

5491
04:20:39,040 --> 04:20:40,920
I'll see you guys in the main cafe...

5492
04:20:41,560 --> 04:20:42,760
