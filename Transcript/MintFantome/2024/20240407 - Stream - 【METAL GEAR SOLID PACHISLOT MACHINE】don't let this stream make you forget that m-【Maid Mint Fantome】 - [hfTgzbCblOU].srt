1
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,380
I'm Fred no band

2
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:34,020
Invisible band Freaky ghost band Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah Yeah Hello Welcome

3
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,830
Do you see What is next to me?

4
00:02:47,790 --> 00:03:00,470
perceive this it's quite quiet right now because uh it's in
like this uh i call it trailer mode i don't know if it has

5
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:13,450
another fort whatever it's my apache slot yippee oh my gosh
my my stuff is kind of all over the place so attract mode

6
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:22,430
demo mode that sounds like the most sense but i kind of like
attract mode attract mode wait that's real attract mode is a

7
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:35,610
actual phrase i've never heard that before it's just like oh
my gosh thank you it's like uh how to say it's like uh she

8
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:43,670
gives you a little like if she flashes a little ankle like
don't you want to try my wears

9
00:03:49,070 --> 00:04:00,610
me actually this is really strange because because i don't
think before i ever did a hand cam because you know for me

10
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:10,870
it's a little difficult as a ghost but i got some special
gloves thank you i know almost nothing about the patchy slot

11
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:17,070
other than the cut scenes and it playing at a convention
once this is a whole new and unique experience i know I'm so

12
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:28,250
excited um paid actor no no I got some ghost gloves because
usually if you see like if I'm trying to show you my hands

13
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:37,250
on on stream you won't be able to see you know because I'm a
ghost like it's a see-through but I got these like special

14
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:50,670
ghost gloves that kind of hold my ectoplasm in so we'll be
A-OK baby yuppie um also I will need to test some audio

15
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,850
stuff with you guys.

16
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,910
I want your opinions because there are three.

Thank you for the donations, thank you, thank you, thank

18
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,830
Pachinko.

19
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:12,550
There are three sound options that we can get for you guys
hearing the machine itself.

20
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,270
Oh my gosh, I'm so nervous.

21
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,310
Thank you.

22
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,150
Thank you guys for the tono so much.

23
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,090
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

24
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,490
The machine looks so cool.

25
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,610
It's very cool.

26
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,470
Honestly, if anything, it just looks amazing, right?

27
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,490
Like it's just so well and so, so well.

28
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,210
It's so well.

29
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,310
It's so pretty.

30
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,850
It's so good.

31
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,750
It's not good.

32
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,850
It's just, you know.

33
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,330
Even without playing it, this thing's rad.

34
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,530
I know, right?

35
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:54,410
like this the details on it are kind of insane also it's
really cool because let me show you like this hold on i'm

36
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:03,010
waiting for it to light back up i'm sorry about the lighting
um i have it will get better i wanted to make sure you could

37
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:12,790
see uh the the of course the um the slots themselves uh it
was a little tricky i had to go through a couple different

38
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:22,210
cameras um i tried to see if there was a way output the
screen itself but also then you wouldn't be able to see the

39
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:35,330
slots so we kind of had to have it in camera mode like this
I current I got my I got my stop talking about my hand I

40
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:50,070
yeah I what was I saying oh my gosh you guys made me forget
um um what was I saying Oh, I got my GoPro actually to work

41
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,590
as like a webcam and it has the best kind of...

42
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,050
Oh my gosh.

43
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,310
It's so good.

44
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:57,910
Oh my gosh.

45
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,170
I screamed.

46
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,430
Don't scream.

47
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,370
Boo.

48
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,650
Thank you.

49
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,430
Almost too spooky to handle.

50
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,770
Real, real ghost activity.

51
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,010
This is actually...

52
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,770
I tricked you guys.

53
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,190
This is a real phasmophobia stream.

54
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,250
Oh my gosh.

55
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,310
But yeah, so sorry that it is like a camera like this.

56
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:35,370
I wish that I could output, maybe in the future I can find a
way to do it if I become so technically literate.

57
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,670
But again, of course we're wanting to see the slots
themselves too.

58
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:49,730
Also just, I don't know if I can, if there's anything like
legally like, you know, I'm Obviously, this is a gambling

59
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:56,850
machine, but I will not be paying any money as I have this
nifty button right here that...

60
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,430
Oh, oh gosh, it started.

61
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,330
That if I press it, it inputs credits for me.

62
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,510
So I'm also sorry there is a slight flicker.

63
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,030
I know I'm apologizing so much, but I really...

64
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,110
I did my best to, like, put up...

65
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,510
put the optimal setup for your enjoyment.

66
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,870
Also, look at this.

67
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,050
This is one big screen.

68
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,590
Isn't that crazy?

69
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,630
It's one huge screen.

70
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,710
It's so awesome.

71
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:35,730
Yeah!

72
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:46,250
I will be picking up the camera and kind of like zooming in
on little bits too because there's some stuff that like

73
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:56,050
happens in here that you can only really see if um oh my god
the music is so awesome if like you're you know on top of it

74
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:04,970
so if since you can't really see it with the webcam oh you
see you can see him just a little bit this is what it looks

75
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:15,490
like okay my my perspective is a little cropped also for
people who are just like this is pachinko no this is patchy

76
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:24,230
slot because it's not pachinko it won't be like you know
what i mean like it won't be all the little balls falling

77
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:31,370
and being noisy and annoying no it's actually quite quiet
which is i mean you could probably can barely hear it right

78
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:42,630
now which brings me to my next thank you thank you i can't
believe we kidnapped a cute girl to represent you mint no i

79
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:50,630
swear this is a ghostly hand ectoplasm gloves on or
ectoplasm uh what's the word

80
00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:12,230
enhance kubuki chopachinko ASMR no thank you okay so we have
three options for your listening pleasure one is just like

81
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:20,670
how it is now right now there's like no music i will let's
see let's uh let's Let's add some cash money up in here.

82
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,070
You can probably barely hear it.

83
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,830
Barely, barely, barely hear it.

84
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,310
I'm just going to put in a ton.

85
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,690
Yeah, I simp.

86
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:31,750
Okay, we maxed that out.

87
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,170
So, I'll also give you a kind of a rundown of a little bit
of this stuff.

88
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,870
Oh, one thing you can't see is right here.

89
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,190
My hand, hello.

90
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,850
On the side here, this is, it's kind of hard to see because
I have my lights out so you can see the screen better.

91
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:53,090
but this is like a a walkie talkie kind of thing and then on
the side there's like a light up exclamation point it's so

92
00:10:53,090 --> 00:11:03,490
cute anyway okay yeah you can hear it okay so this is a
little button to control a menu the menu kind of changes uh

93
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:10,610
how to say the it changes um

94
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:22,590
you can change there's some points where um the they'll like
say like push button one push button two push button three

95
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:30,610
and someone will be like manna ka megi he daddy and uh you
can change the voice you can change it to like snake or the

96
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:41,010
boss or signant oh my gosh thank you for the ari guadalardo
arigado chum thank you you're the reason why i'm getting

97
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:49,370
into metal gear now so i'm really excited thank you so much
but there's also you can change the mode so there's like

98
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:59,710
advanced mode normal mode and classic mode i honestly i have
no idea the difference they are all difficult i have no idea

99
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:10,990
i have no idea um of course we have our little lever here we
have the payout button right here and of course our our

100
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:23,990
clicky clacky buttons so let's try all right oh my god wow
great start oh my gosh it doesn't just look so good though

101
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:38,390
oh my god snake looks so awesome okay i'm gonna keep going
until something oh okay we got spotted kind of so this is a

102
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:47,230
good point to test the audio i'd say because you can hear
also i can't let this let it run for too long just right now

103
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:53,150
because something kind of cool happens if you let the slots
keep going keep going but this is a good point to test the

104
00:12:53,150 --> 00:13:05,970
audio so so this is the first audio it's really mostly it's
just my regular mic but I do have another mic set up over

105
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:15,770
here so you can hear the game a little bit better but if I
play my mic and this mic at the same obviously there's gonna

106
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:27,850
be an echo in my voice we can't hear the audio I know I know
it's it's not on right now thank you but if I have only this

107
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:38,730
mic on it kind of sounds like an Xbox mic so I'm gonna turn
on this mic now so you can hear how is that it's probably

108
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:45,550
you can hear my voice twice but if it doesn't bother you
guys we can keep it because obviously I want you guys to

109
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,470
hear my voice.

110
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,090
It's loud?

111
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,800
I'm so sorry.

112
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,560
I'm so sorry.

113
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,020
It's kind of spooky.

114
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:08,500
And then if I turn off my mic and I only have...

115
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,540
It's still loud?

116
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,180
It's still loud?

117
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,040
Sorry, sorry.

118
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:22,040
If I only have this mic on, I sound like I'm playing Xbox
Call of Duty.

119
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,240
So which one would you guys prefer?

120
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,800
I'm going to put up a poll actually.

121
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,960
That'll help me the most I think.

122
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,320
So, oh, which mic?

123
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,340
Which?

124
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,820
Mint only?

125
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,900
Mint and Pachinko.

126
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,930
Xbox mic.

127
00:14:51,350 --> 00:15:02,650
um the way i actually it's it's kind of funny it's kind of
funny um how this is actually the webcam mic i intended on

128
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:15,550
having like oh oh see see ah the sorrow comes and he's just
like he says stop the reel stop is from spinning it's so

129
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:25,410
spooky i love it um but uh the this is actually a webcam I
intended on having like a webcam kind of like giving a more

130
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:35,230
close-up image but in the end my webcam was kind of shit so
it it just didn't do a good quality so I'm really sorry but

131
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:45,490
this is the best I could do in what I had yeah that was cool
right it's so cool okay so we we managed to escape now you

132
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:51,930
are going to see all of this a lot this this cut these cut
scenes you are going to see so many times and I bet you are

133
00:15:51,930 --> 00:16:02,010
I bet you we're gonna see a bunny oh never mind oh the tree
was in the way Wow I was wrong I saw a bunny so many times

134
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:10,970
okay we're walking down this is what I mean that not a lot
happens in this game also I see that the result is mint and

135
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:16,650
pachinko double okay so we're gonna keep it like this I'm so
sorry if it's distracting for some of you guys but

136
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,250
Dang, lost the shot.

137
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,330
Yeah, the tree was in the way is what he said.

138
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,050
Yeah, the tree was in the way.

139
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,130
So we're gonna bet, we're gonna do this, we're walking down
the pathway.

140
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,090
A whole lot of nothing is going on.

141
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,010
Gosh, oh my gosh, what is it?

142
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,770
What could it be?

143
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,270
What could it be?

144
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:38,770
What could it be?

145
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,490
It's gonna be, I don't know.

146
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,270
A chance!

147
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,510
Yeah, it's a chance!

148
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,730
Oh my gosh, he gave me a chance, you guys.

149
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,710
Oh, we upgraded to blue!

150
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,590
I have no idea what that means.

151
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,950
Our loot box in Metal Gear, can you imagine?

152
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:01,770
Maybe this.

153
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,030
Oh, pasha!

154
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:03,810
Oh, dang.

155
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,170
Of course the one time, look at that.

156
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,390
Isn't it so cool?

157
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,370
Gosh, it's...

158
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,370
Oh!

159
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,310
Okay, place your bets, everyone.

160
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,430
What do you think we're going to get?

161
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,290
I think we're going to get a fork.

162
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,110
What do you think you're gonna get?

163
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,770
What do you think?

164
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,610
The screen broke.

165
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,830
I know it's so cool, right?

166
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,350
A cigar or ration?

167
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,710
I think we're gonna get a fork But if we get a ration that
would be pretty awesome.

168
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,790
I'll okay.

169
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,250
I don't all the times I've played this I've only I'll give
you guys a clue.

170
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,930
I've only gotten a fork and a ration before.

171
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:44,450
I have never gotten a cigar or an Ammunition box or a key or
the mystery ever so streamer luck.

172
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,410
Come on Streamer luck.

173
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,330
Come on streamers luck.

174
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,050
Oh We got a fork.

175
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:52,970
That's okay.

176
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:54,610
Next time.

177
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:55,750
Sokolov!

178
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:57,510
He's gonna say,

179
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,370
What?

180
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:03,470
Oh my god.

181
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,230
I'm breaking all expectations today.

182
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,810
It's a fork!

183
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,190
Let's go, baby!

184
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,030
We upgraded the gold!

185
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,270
I have no idea what that means.

186
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,330
Oh.

187
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:24,310
Oh my god, are we gonna, oh, wait, now we will see the
bunny, I think.

188
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,030
What?

189
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,450
Oh my god, what is going on?

190
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,330
No way!

191
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:38,490
Oh my god, oh, oh, oh, oh, did you see that glitch?

192
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,210
Thank you for the don't know!

193
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,630
Based on lore, would this ghastly form be akin to venish,
venish?

194
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,150
Ooh, the Venish.

195
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,470
Venom punished steak or big boss.

196
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,690
So I'm absolutely jealous you got your hands on such a
legendary trophy.

197
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,010
I know some people...

198
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,450
Good!

199
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,330
What does that mean?

200
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,090
What does that mean?

201
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:16,790
I know some people have wondered how much this cost me.

202
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,130
Oh!

203
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,070
Yes!

204
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:19,890
Hutton!

205
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,870

209
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,190
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,290
Okay, next.

211
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,250
Good, good.

212
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,650
The music is so cute.

213
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,950
And continue, next.

214
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,210
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

215
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,050
Okay, okay.

216
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,690
Wait, why are we suddenly inside the building?

217
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:10,650
Okay.

218
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,210
Last game!

219
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:13,990
Oh my gosh, why?

220
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,610
It's on fire!

221
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,690
I'll be honest, I have never seen this.

222
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,810
Get him, get him, Asala!

223
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,410
We're gonna do it!

224
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,370
Oh my god, no!

225
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,610
Wait, where's Trump?

226
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,550
We're getting back to his mission already?

227
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,350
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

228
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:33,410
Maybe.

229
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,290
Okay, let's go save Sokolov, I guess.

230
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:40,750
Sokolov, I guess.

231
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,770
Sokolov, real!

232
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,870
Okay, I don't think you can choose a guy, I think it just
kind of...

233
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,250
We're just gonna attack him.

234
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:49,870
Alright.

235
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,870
Ta-ta, ta-ta, ta-ta.

236
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,300
Okay, come on, Snake.

237
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,360
Take his butt down!

238
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,340
Great!

239
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,940
Oh my god, it's so cute.

240
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,240
I love Tiny Paramedic.

241
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,380
She's so precious.

242
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:17,240
Now, hopefully, okay, so if we do all of this well, if we
complete this virtuous mission well, we'll get the actual

243
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,360
cutscenes of the game, which is what I really want to show
you guys.

244
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,320
So, thank you for the dodge.

245
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,800
Thank you!

246
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,800
Okay, took that guy down.

247
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,740
Easy peasy, great.

248
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,240
Come on.

249
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,640
Oh my god!

250
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,260
He's got the knife.

251
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,760
Oh, okay.

252
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,320
Hold on.

253
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:37,840
Let's try again.

254
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,420
Let's try again.

255
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,840
The timing was not right.

256
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,840
Mike desynced.

257
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,340
Oh, I'm so sorry.

258
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,550
I'm doing my best, you guys.

259
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,150
Okay, here we go.

260
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,550
Here we go.

261
00:21:59,630 --> 00:21:59,890
Jump.

262
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,250
Make his butt down.

263
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,800
Oh, not that way.

264
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,380
Get better at gambling.

265
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:22,960
Good.

266
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,780
Okay, we at least made it.

267
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,560
Yes.

268
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,680
Chats it up.

269
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,580
Oh, it's fine.

270
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,580
There is a button here.

271
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,780
I'm not quite sure what it's for.

272
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,440
It does say push, but I don't know ever when to push it.

273
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,700
Oh no!

274
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,700
Oh no!

275
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,620
So loud!

276
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,000
Too!

277
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,300
Thank you!

278
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,600
You've even been to surprise by the patchy slack going off
script.

279
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,680
There's a lot.

280
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,660
Oh, I have to add more credits.

281
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,180
We've already spent this.

282
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,800
It goes up to 50 credits.

283
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,340
And we've already spent them.

284
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,980
Isn't that crazy?

285
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,800
I don't know actually how much.

286
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,220
I don't know actually how much it cost to play this.

287
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,900
Does anyone have any better insight?

288
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,940
Oh, I always fail this, you guys.

289
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,380
I always fail this.

290
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,940
$20 per credit.

291
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,600
Does the Pachinko machine come with some sort of developer
mode that lets you automatically get alternate scenes?

292
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,520
If it does, I don't...

293
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,400
I don't know.

294
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,800
You guys, my luck is coming in real clutch here.

295
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,760
Cutie looks...

296
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,540
Okay.

297
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,940
Come on, Snake.

298
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:44,920
Don't miss.

299
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,740
Oh, damn.

300
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,120
I told you guys.

301
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:55,620
I'm sorry.

302
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,340
I think now we have to go back to the very beginning.

303
00:23:59,740 --> 00:23:59,820
No?

304
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,240
Yeah.

305
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,540
Okay.

306
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:00,840
Yep.

307
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,240
We're back at the very beginning.

308
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,360
Your eyes jump.

309
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,340
Thank you.

310
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,480
There is... So basically...

311
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:26,340
when I came when I was setting up yesterday for this I did
have to like I did have to kind of do some stuff because

312
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:34,480
when I hadn't turned it on in the two months that I was gone
like there's like a thing with the RAM I had to like clear

313
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:44,300
the RAM and like there's like a system key and then I press
a reset button and turn the system key off And it was like

314
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,600
this whole thing.

315
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,840
Oh, oh, sorry.

316
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,120
I still have money.

317
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,160
I still have money.

318
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,480
Oh, it sucks that we went back to the beginning.

319
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,780
I want to hopefully, there's two things I want to show.

320
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,720
First is a boss fight, whichever boss we can get.

321
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,340
And second is the, if we can get big boss mode.

322
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,460
Actually, I do want to show.

323
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,440
There we go.

324
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,540
I do want to show the menu too if I have a chance.

325
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:21,820
Oh!

326
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:22,400
Oh!

327
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:23,700
Oh!

328
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:23,940
Oh!

329
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,720
Oh no no!

330
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
We'll take this guy down.

331
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,700
We'll take him down.

332
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:30,800
Oh!

333
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,300
Nice!

334
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,880
Your soup!

335
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:37,680
Your soup!

336
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,660
So your amount of effort you went through to stream, this is
so funny.

337
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,220
What do you mean?

338
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,500
I paid for Streamlabs Pro to make you look at my Oshi stuff.

339
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,140
Wait, I didn't- I missed it!

340
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,740
Oh, here we go.

341
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,160
So this is the menu that I was talking about earlier.

342
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,860
So this is like the kind of mode.

343
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,500
There's classic, normal, advanced.

344
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,900
We're just on normal.

345
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,320
Yeah.

346
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,560
Oh, no.

347
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,680
Oh, okay.

348
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,840
Just kidding.

349
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,440
I can't show you the other things now.

350
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,200
I can't show you the other.

351
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,400
Well, next time.

352
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:25,940
Oh, oh.

353
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,360
Here we go.

354
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,260
Okay.

355
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,300
This is the, um, say Navi Custom, is the Navigator.

356
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,120
So you can have Major Zero.

357
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:42,580
You can have, oh, I thought there was Siggint, but I think I
remembered Siggint just because he's here.

358
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,920
You can't actually have him talking for you.

359
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,140
But obviously Snake, Asala and the boss.

360
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,400
I think I had it set to the boss, but who do you guys want?

361
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:02,940
I don't think we've heard, we haven't heard, them doing the
yeah but which one do you guys want Ocelot?

362
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,060
Ocelot?

363
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:10,760
I saw Ocelot the most I think he sounds so goofy

364
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:22,040
isn't it just the game just looks so beautiful also little
snake down here will sometimes like be dressed up different

365
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,760
sometimes he'll have his shirt off

366
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,400
Sometimes...

367
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,980
Sometimes he'll be wearing a beret, the tree was in the...

368
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,220
Oh!

369
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,540
We're snow!

370
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,540
I don't know what this is.

371
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,280
I have no idea.

372
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,560
I don't know at all.

373
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,260
I think it helps when you go into like the virtuous mission
and stuff.

374
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:43,580
Oh!

375
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,480

00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,780
Okay, these guys are...

Hold on!

391
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,140
Oh, they're so stupid.

392
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,460
We're just crashed behind a tree.

393
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,320
These guys are idiots.

394
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,560
Oh, it's glitching again.

395
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,520
Okay, interesting, interesting.

396
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,380
Oh.

397
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,020
Um...

398
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,080
Yours.

399
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,200
Oh!

400
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,480
Tiger Stripe!

401
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,780
Okay, nice.

402
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,860
I wonder when we'll see the body.

403
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,460
I have been given the gift of prophecy.

404
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,800
Thank you for the donuts!

405
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Oh, I was going to say earlier, I keep forgetting, um, wait,
former slot mathematician here, you should get more

406
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:14,140
cutscenes if you bet max credits and max, I don't know, oh,
I do max bet every time, and I'll just add all the credits.

407
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:24,600
Oh, we're going to shoot this guy, we're going to shoot this
guy this time, or we're going to throw, um, Something to

408
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,860
distract him.

409
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,020
Oh!

410
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:26,640
Oh!

411
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,300
Oh!

412
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,860
Oh, my gosh!

413
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,660
Streamer, the...

414
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:33,900
Pichu!

415
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,380
Oh.

416
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,660
Oh, okay.

417
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,400
Why does it...

418
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,960
Every time that I try to make the noise, it doesn't work.

419
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:41,800
Um...

420
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,320
This is the one where he beats up the barrel!

421
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,200
Trans!

422
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,880
We got to see Vulcan!

423
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,520
Vulcan looks so good in this game, it's crazy.

424
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,960
Um, sorry, I keep feeling distracted, what I want to say.

425
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,440
Um, people might be wondering how much this cost me.

426
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,720
Usually, I know where I yellow.

427
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:16,620
Usually, I don't like to, you know, I'm not trying to, I
don't want to, like, brag.

428
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,520
I'm not trying to brag or anything.

429
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,700
Do we get to see Rykov?

430
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,040

Oh, come on.

455

We stepped on a stick.

462
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,840
Oh, we are so suspicious.

463
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,380
Who?

464
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,600
Oh my gosh.

465
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,540
It's okay.

466
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,260
Everybody?

467
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,220
Calm down.

468
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,500
I like how we're like non-lethal mode the whole time

469
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:43,500
never thought I would watch slots I like how he calls them
annoying guys this is like men don't do it he's burning the

470
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:51,380
papers oh my gosh oh we're green now we're green I don't
know what that means.

471
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:52,980
They are annoying.

472
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,580
Yeah, they're extremely annoying.

473
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,180
Sagan!

474
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,240
We're red now!

475
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,600
I don't know what that means.

476
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,820
Oh, oh come on, come on, come on.

477
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,400
Come on, come on, come on.

478

Come on!

479
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
Loop boxes.

480
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:13,960
Hate me.

481
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,040
Oh, Sokolov's still burning those papers.

482
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,040
Nanda korewa.

483
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,760
If none of this makes sense to you guys, it doesn't make
sense to me either.

484
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,420
I have no idea how this works.

485
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,640
I have tried looking up like...

486
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,140
Like, if you get this combination, if you get this
combination, but like...

487
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,880
I don't know.

488
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,780
Triple blue seems common.

489
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:43,820
What?

490
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,400
What?

491
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,440
What?

492
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:48,980
What?

493
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,200
Paramedic.

494
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,900
She's looking at her body again, you know?

495
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,840
They don't make walkthroughs for slot machines.

496
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:08,500
This is the walkthrough for anyone else who owns a Metal
Gear Solid Apache slot machine.

497
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,100
We're seeing these guys quite often though.

498
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,920
Just keep putting in credits.

499
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,280
Okay, okay, what do you guys think we're gonna get this
time?

500
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,820
Thank you!

501
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,700
Gotta feed the patchy slot.

502
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,960
Wait, okay.

503
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,600
Which do you guys think we're gonna get?

504
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,660
Fork?

505
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,080
Key?

506
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:29,220
Key?

507
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:29,660
Key!

508
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,900
Oh, ma ma da na.

509
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,040
We gotta ration!

510
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,520
Get you guys.

511
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,320
Oh?

512
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,160
Another chance at the loot box.

513
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:42,800
Please.

514
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,440
I hate this.

515
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Just a box.

516
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,140
It's literally just a box.

517
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,520
There's a tree in the way.

518
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:02,880
Oh.

519
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,060
Ha!

520
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,680
Ten!

521
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,400
Alright guys, come on.

522
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,900
30% camouflage.

523
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,620
That's okay though.

524
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,120
That's okay.

525
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,360
Come on.

526
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,120
I just want to show you guys the box.

527
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:35,900
battle and how unfair it is it is so unfair it's absolute oh
my god he got on his knees for us bring him to his knees

528
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:46,260
snake what does hot 10 mean hot 10 means uh like progress
like uh we can continue forward the development

529
00:37:50,140 --> 00:38:04,060
really don't understand why um okay oh oh okay yeah virtuous
mission okay cool cool cool i really want us to get to like

530
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:12,960
the actual because there when you get to like real virtuous
mission you can um you can see him like doing the the well

531
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:24,280
he doesn't do the flips in this which is actually a sin but
how far have you gotten it's hard to say because sometimes

532
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:34,360
when I do this I'll I'll get to um like I'll get to a boss
fight and it will be Acelot and sometimes I'll get to a boss

533
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:42,800
fight and it'll be the the fear or something I've never seen
the fury and I've never seen the end so if we get to either

534
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:51,140
of them lucky day oh no no you would think that I love this
seven it's so awesome looking in fun.

535
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,360
So you can kind of see it a little bit better.

536
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,640
It's got like big boss art.

537
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,880
It's really cool.

538
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,460
Here's, oh, boss, virtuous mission.

539
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,620
Oh wow, there's playing cutscenes in the back.

540
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,200
I just realized, oh my gosh, I never noticed that.

541
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,280
Are those cutscenes from, those don't look like, they're
remade.

542
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,340
Those look like, yeah, that's from the actual game.

543
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:23,440
What?

544
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,760
That's cool!

545
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,000
Okay, I...

546
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,920
Sorry, hold on.

547
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,180

00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,500
Thank you.

551
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,300
Okay.

552
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,600
We're good, I think.

553
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,560
We're good.

554
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,000
Okay.

555
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,160
I have money.

556
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,240
Don't kick me out.

557
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,280
Good!

558
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,660
It's...

559
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,280
Oh!

560
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,280
Oh!

561
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:12,460
I don't know if it makes a difference if you you can do it
out of order too but I don't know if it makes a difference

562
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:25,180
to make it like a better chance if you do it in order good
okay it's not great but we're getting good not gonna lie

563
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,840
having my arm out like

564
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:36,930
having my arms out floaty but like Having my arm like this
is kind of a workout.

565
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,850
Okay, all right, come on.

566
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:41,930
Take him out.

567
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,150
Never mind.

568
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:50,330
Take him out with a great, good, Tony the Tiger, he's great.

569
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,500
All

570
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,420
right, this is, okay, he's chance two, chance two.

571
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,260
All right, let's try and get stealth maybe.

572
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,940
Oh, three in a row.

573
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,960
Come on.

574
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,680
Tony the tiger buff.

575
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,920
No.

576
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,120
We're back at the beginning.

577
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:48,720
Oh!

578
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,980
Can you see?

579
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,160
Wait, you can't see.

580
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,220
He's got his shirt off.

581
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,580
He's got his shirt off.

582
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,680
I don't know why he's naked now.

583
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,470
He's a naked little man.

584
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,590
It's creepy.

585
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,310
Because he's a naked snake.

586
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,530
No, that solid snake.

587
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,370
No, that solid snake.

588
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,190
I'm surprised we haven't... I haven't had the max.

589
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,570
It won't let me max bet, so...

590
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:41,530
Yeah, I'm eating.

591
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,470
Oh, I love how she calls.

592
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,770
She's like, hey, you eating?

593
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,010
No, that is not so insane.

594
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,490
Oh, alright guys.

595
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,710
We got a ration last time.

596
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,630
What do you think we're gonna get this time?

597
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:12,250
It's not like whenever I stop it if I can be like here and I
stop it and it'll still go to fork So here I'll here.

598
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,790
I'll try like on ammunition

599
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,370
So it's a skill issue.

600
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:27,950
No

601
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:32,910
Okay, that was it.

602
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,850
Oh, it's glitching again That is that's awesome.

603
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:40,290
That's not Something happening, or not something wrong with
the screen.

604
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:41,590
It's part of the game.

605
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:42,690
Is it okay?

606
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,190
Can you even call this a game?

607
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,710
You were saying...

608
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:49,550
Shh, shh.

609
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:50,130
Hush.

610
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:51,290
Hush.

611
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:52,770
Oh.

612
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:53,830
Pshaw!

613
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:54,450
Oh!

614
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:55,830
Yeah!

615
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,090
Pshaw!

616
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:57,750
Okay.

617
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,130
Well, I got one at least.

618
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,550
Oh.

619
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:02,950
Is it just a box?

620
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:04,450
This is a game?

621
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,050
You think so?

622
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,190
It's a pay to win game.

623
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,110
Nothing.

624
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,770
No, that is not a skill issue.

625
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:22,890
Yeah.

626
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:23,730
Cool.

627
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,590
Come on, baby.

628
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,470
We are tiger stripes.

629
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,810
Okay, okay, come on, come on.

630
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,560
Come on, just a box.

631
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,660
Oh, chance?

632
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,120
Oh, Mr. It's a man.

633
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,760
What could it be?

634
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,760
I didn't.

635
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,800
They're looking around for me.

636
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,060
Trying to find me.

637
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,860
Oh, we're back to Sokolov.

638
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,260
It's just a fever dream of scenes.

639
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,900
Like, everything is all over the...

640
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,540
We're back in the woods.

641
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:09,900
What is going on?

642
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,260
Why did Vulcan come out?

643
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,060
We have no idea.

644
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,420
We're back at Sokolov, but he's doing his little thing.

645
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,900
I just don't understand.

646
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,280
It's all over the place.

647
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,780
It actually is.

648
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:31,040
Usually it doesn't take this long to get to, like, a boss or
something.

649
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,580
I think my luck is actually just bad today.

650
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:34,140
Oh!

651
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,600
Okay, we're throwing the...

652
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,620
What is that, magazine?

653
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,220
Okay.

654
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,040
Still just a box.

655
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,200
Someday.

656
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,400
Someday.

657
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:45,760
Oh!

658
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:46,940
Today.

659
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,280
Right now.

660
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,680
Right now!

661
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,720
Oh, never mind.

662
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:57,620
Oh.

663
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,180
You're so...

664
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,480
Just look the other way.

665
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,620
All you have to do is look the opposite direction and you
would have seen...

666
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:07,420
Oh!

667
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,940
Thank you, Asa-Lot, for your direction.

668
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:12,920
Thank you.

669
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:28,550
basically he's saying like I thought I saw him around here
like he was definitely somewhere around here no one here

670
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:40,770
they're idiots 180 IQ not stopping this stream until she
beats the boss this is the stream you guys aren't you so oh

671
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:46,650
sorry Ocelot I was not listening to you I was not I was not
paying attention at all, I'm so sorry.

672
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:47,850
Oh, okay, here we go.

673
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:53,270
Asala is gonna get us the mystery thing because he loves
snakes so much.

674
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:56,910
Alright, Asala.

675
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:03,330
Asala, this, whatever you, whatever you decide for us will
be, will decide your true love, okay?

676
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:04,750
Okay.

677
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,210
Oh, crap!

678
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:09,770
Oh my god.

679
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:13,730
He knows that snake loves to eat.

680
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:15,950
Twil?

681
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:17,390
Wow.

682
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,670
Oh my god, he loves us for real.

683
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:23,190
You are a simp, Ocelot.

684
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:27,230
Didn't think we'd actually say that this is this thing in
action, Pokcham.

685
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:28,630
I know her.

686
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:30,770
Me too.

687
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:31,890
Oh!

688
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:32,890
What?

689
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:43,010
I don't know, Ocelot know, I don't know if like he starts
giving us direction when if he like, if the game feels bad

690
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,450
for us, we're not getting any wins.

691
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,230
And so Ocelot's like, hey, I'm coming in to help you.

692
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,810
Rations taste horrible, though.

693
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:55,210
I think it's better than eating a dead rat in the forest,
I'm just saying.

694
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,410
An uncooked rat.

695
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:02,640
Hmm?

696
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:03,880
What?

697
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,900
Pity poll.

698
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,540
What?

699
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:09,760
What?

700
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:09,980
What?

701
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:12,640
Okay.

702
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:23,130
See?

703
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,010
I was down here and it still went to fork.

704
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,790
I was down here and I went to fork.

705
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:35,310
Rigged.

706
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:36,670
Oh, oh, oh.

707
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,410
Oh, this face.

708
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,850
Snake, oh my God.

709
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:52,120
Oh, no, they're starting to multiply.

710
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,660
Oh no, they're hanging out.

711
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,960
Oh gosh, it's a party.

712
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,000
We were not invited.

713
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,040
Asala, I got the rations because snake is a snack.

714
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,260
So true.

715
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,320
A fork.

716
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,900
Do you think he'll see us behind the tree?

717
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,880
Will we be spotted?

718
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,240
I love that they're just like, yeah, he's definitely here.

719
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,900
Yeah, I definitely think I saw him.

720
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,760
Okay, let's go, sir.

721
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:31,600
Okay.

722
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,000
Snow.

723
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,460
They're just chilling.

724
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,040
You guys, my luck is kind of...

725
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,660
Oh, hi, Sagan.

726
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,700
I'm okay.

727
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:44,660
He's like, how are you doing?

728
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,300
I'm good.

729
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,500
How's your condition?

730
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,140
Our stamina.

731
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:51,700
Oh!

732
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,300
Thank you.

733
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,500
Oh my gosh, paramedics saved us from the jungle.

734
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,760
Finally, we can continue forward.

735
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:01,980
Eventually, we can...

736
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:13,840

Yes, according to Metal Gear Solid 3, there are jungles in
Russia.

00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:02,270
Isn't that the most fascinating?

778
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,860
Not yet.

00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,800
Okay, I think you have to get it in the first try to get
great, right?

00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,120
Just kidding!

782
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,060
I proved myself wrong again.

783
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,020
One last.

784
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,040
One last guy.

785
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,060
Okay.

786
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,020
Alright, here we go.

787
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,270
Alright, isn't it?

788
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:43,710
Come on.

789
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:48,290
The audio fixed.

790
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:49,710
Oh, was it out of sync before?

791
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:51,850
That's so weird.

792
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,340
Eyes!

793
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,140
Is this better now?

794
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,100
Oh, I'm so sorry.

795
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:06,760
I didn't realize.

796
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:11,340
I thought you meant like there was an echo in that, like,
you could hear me twice.

797
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,440
I didn't realize that it was, like, a delayed echo.

798
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,640
It was double for me when I joined.

799
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,780
I'm so sorry.

800
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,300
Oh, my gosh.

801
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,200
It must have been really awful to listen to.

802
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,840
I'm so sorry.

803
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,240
That's so...

804
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,460
Yeah, I'm so sorry about that.

805
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:38,160
It must have been so annoying to listen to me.

806
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:39,690
There's

807
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,870
been two times enjoying my...

808
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,420
Shut up!

809
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,840
I was hoping that I could, like, channel my energy into
that.

810
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,260
Look at Tiny Ocelot.

811
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,740
He's just so goofy looking.

812
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:00,860
Oh!

813
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,700
Okay, okay, okay.

814
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,740
Come on, Snake.

815
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:05,420
Snake.

816
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:06,460
Snake!

817
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,140
Don't miss!

818
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,080
Snake!

819
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:09,480
Snake!

820
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,320
Snake.

821
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,180
Snake, please.

822
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,300
Snake, please.

823
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,200
Oh my god.

824
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:15,800
Please.

825
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,080
Please to God, Snake.

826
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:17,980
We need to continue.

827
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,340
Please, Snake.

828
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,360
I'm begging you.

829
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,020
I'm begging you.

830
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:21,920
I'm on my knees, please.

831
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:22,660
Snake!

832
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,920
Snake, don't miss!

833
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:24,840
Do this!

834
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:57,330
Also, you can't tell, but my credits have not gone down at
all, which is very impressive 12-hour stream let's go it

835
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:06,990
already has been an hour we haven't barely seen any of the
game you know what actually hold on hold on I think let me

836
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:16,990
try changing the game mode next time I have the option to go
to the menu let me let me try changing the game mode because

837
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:20,990
maybe being on normal It's kind of messing some stuff up.

838
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:22,910
Do you own this machine?

839
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,570
Hi Hannah!

840
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:26,750
Yeah, this is my this is my patchy slot machine.

841
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:27,870
It's my baby.

842
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:31,830
Hold on.

843
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:35,390
It's got to light up so we can go to it.

844
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:38,330
Thanks for the donut!

845
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:40,970
Double mint is fine, but this works too.

846
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:48,070
How much time have you spent playing this exactly?

847
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:59,690
less than you'd imagine like I'll like every so often like
you know do it or I usually turn it on when I like if I I

848
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:11,270
say when but it's really if I have company over because it's
kind of like you know it's kind of like what's the word

849
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:20,730
strange thing to have oh no the echoes back Is it better if
I just do this?

850
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:27,950
Thank you, Zero.

851
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:29,450
Is it better if I just do that?

852
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:30,190
It's worse?

853
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:33,490
Wait, way better.

854
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:35,910
What's the echo?

855
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:38,110
You guys are so weird.

856
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:39,990
I think the echo is better than that.

857
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:41,390
Okay.

858
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:43,530
I'll trust Hannah's opinion.

859
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,170
I'll trust Hannah's opinion.

860
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,590
Hold on, I'm paying out.

861
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:52,930
There we go.

862
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:53,170
Okay.

863
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:55,890
Classic mode.

864
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:57,470
Let's change it to classic.

865
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:01,490
And now we will retry.

866
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:03,290
We will retry.

867
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:06,250
Choo!

868
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:11,910
Do you ever just get up in the middle of the night and just
go one more spin?

869
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,510
It's a...

870
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,510
It's a...

871
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:22,870
There are definitely times when I am playing on it, that I'm
just like, okay, I'll end on a win.

872
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:26,950
And as you can tell, that's not easy.

873
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:32,970
I don't even think there's a true way of beating this, you
know?

874
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,950
Like, I don't even know if you can fight the boss.

875
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:43,030
Though I do know you can fight the four bosses, or the four,
like, you can fight the fear, the fury, the end, and the

876
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:43,430
pain.

877
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,610
Look at this.

878
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:46,910
We're

879
00:59:50,730 --> 01:00:02,930
Oh The trees in the way oh my god take him out Have you
changed have you changed the difficulty inside?

880
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:04,610
Is there a way to do that?

881
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:08,630
I'll be honest this thing hasn't really it never came with
an instruction manual.

882
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:17,630
It came with a piece of paper So I Can you die in this if
you can do boss battles and when you die you just go back to

883
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,610
this area It's like the beginning, you know?

884
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:34,240
But yeah, I don't know actually how to, uh, if there's a way
to change the difficulty on the inside.

885
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:35,940
I don't know.

886
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,980
Load the last save.

887
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:40,820
Okay, guys.

888
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,680
I'm guessing key.

889
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:46,140
Key.

890
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:46,760
Key.

891
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,480
I'm gonna press it on ammunition.

892
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,580
Oh, damn.

893
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,680
It's actually really easy.

894
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:56,720
It takes, like, less than a minute.

895
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,060
If you have both keys, I can tell you how.

896
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,680
I do have both keys.

897
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:03,320
I do.

898
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,540
This is the one to open.

899
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,340
And then this is the one for the...

900
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:10,700
For the...

901
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,140
What's it called?

902
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,100
What's it?

903
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:16,940
Hold on.

904
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,420
Something key.

905
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:19,960
I don't remember.

906
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:25,380
Though, I don't want to do it right now, obviously, because
I would have to open this up.

907
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,180
is gonna disturb my setup.

908
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:33,880
But I would love to know how for the future, because...

909
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,060
Oh, never mind.

910
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,140
Why would you tease me?

911
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,420
Oh, snow!

912
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,640
One day.

913
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,300
But I kind of like...

914
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,420
I don't know, maybe I'm...

915
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,000
Oh, oh, snow again!

916
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:53,820
Didn't we...

917
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:54,680
I don't understand.

918
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:55,240
I don't.

919
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,100
I don't understand the mechanics.

920
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,300
I don't get it at all.

921
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:02,240
I don't understand why did we get snow and then we get snow
again?

922
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:03,600
What is the point of the snow?

923
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,580
Why do I get camouflage, but it doesn't do anything?

924
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:07,820
Why do I get camouflage?

925
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:15,760
And then when I go to, when I go to the virtuous mission, my
thing is at zero or question mark.

926
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,040
I don't get it.

927
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,380
It's so confusing.

928
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:19,860
Oh, shibata.

929
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:23,100
Nanda.

930
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:24,320
Nanda.

931
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,700
Hidden modifiers.

932
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,080
It has to be there, right?

933
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

934
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:36,840
You go good now.

935
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,580
Don't move.

936
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,580
Why did X trouble disappear?

937
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:47,620
Please.

938
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:50,620
Please.

939
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,520
Just something happened.

940
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:55,520
Snow!

941
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,160
Oh my god.

942
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,800
Oh, oops.

943
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:06,400
What?

944
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,000
Animals!

945
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:11,620
Animals!

946
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:14,900
Animals!

947
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:21,260
70%!

948

949
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,520
We did it!

950
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,380

952
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,860
We got it!

953
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,940
Oh, what did it do?

954
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:38,900
Who knows?

955
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:40,620
Huh?

956
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,240
The tree.

01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,520

Long time, no sight.

974
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:26,220
There

975
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:30,670
we go.

976
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:32,730
Now I want frosted flakes.

977
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:35,490
Um.

978
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:46,980
I have a distinct memory of frosted flakes from like, you
know how uh, well, at like some great!

979
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,480
At some, uh, like hoes.

980
01:05:49,500 --> 01:06:02,660
and stuff in the United States like when if they have
breakfast you can get like the little cereal boxes yeah the

981
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:13,580
mini boxes yeah I never would I never my mom never got
frosted flakes well she really never got like any kind of

982
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:22,160
like sugary cereals like that for me as a kid there was one
cereal that she would get that like I very lovingly call

983
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:26,080
cardboard O's because they just had no flavor.

984
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:37,460
I think those kind of messed me up for life because my taste
palette has been very directly influenced by cardboard O's.

985
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,620
So Cheerios?

986
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:40,540
No, no, no.

987
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:45,800
They were they were Cheerios from like one of those health
food stores.

988
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:47,800
Okay, come on.

989
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:57,110
Oh my gosh, you guys, I'm not feeling I don't know.

990
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:58,330
I don't know.

991
01:06:58,810 --> 01:06:59,890
I'm feeling nervous.

992
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:01,410
Oh, I'm sweating.

993
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:05,670
Oh, I'm sweating snake, please, please, please, snake,
please God.

994
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:06,470
I'm not gonna look.

995
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:07,010
I'm not gonna look.

996
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:08,190
I'm not gonna look.

997
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:39,720
Open machine, turn switch under small key off, put in small
key and turn.

998
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,580
Turn on switch below key.

999
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:46,480
On back of door, look for red number with button behind
small plastic sliding door.

1000
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:48,240
Push button to change difficulty.

1001
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,520
One through six.

1002
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,160
One hard easy six.

1003
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:53,260
Oh my gosh.

1004
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:58,960
It's so funny because I know exactly what you're talking
about with the buttons and the keys.

1005
01:07:59,180 --> 01:07:59,840
I'm like, oh, okay.

1006
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:01,060
I know where those are.

1007
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:01,720
Yes, yes.

1008
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,920
You guys, this is so pathetic.

1009
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,380
I finally can show you my patchy slot.

1010
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,680
I mean, I mean, oh.

1011
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:34,770
I can show you a patchy slot machine that I've had this for
a while and I've always wanted to show people and it's going

1012
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:35,290
crazy.

1013
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:36,570
Sorry.

1014
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,910
There's also supposed to be a volume control.

1015
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,410
There is.

1016
01:08:42,510 --> 01:08:47,110
Actually, I haven't turned much down because it usually was
very loud.

1017
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:54,550
Anyway, what was I saying?

1018
01:08:57,610 --> 01:09:02,330
But my game, my game is camera shy.

1019
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:05,110
It's getting, what's the word?

1020
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:16,410
um you know when you uh do poorly when people are watching
you and uh what's that word performance anxiety yes

1021
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:27,830
performance anxiety stage fright oh bullets blue ah

1022
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:36,670
i mean you love metal gear so shouldn't you be thrilled for
the excuse to just keep playing it indefinitely.

1023
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:37,670
So true.

1024
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:42,550
Katina!

1025
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:47,110
Oh my gosh, these guys are so stupid.

1026
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:48,030
Snow!

1027
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,110
Come on, animals.

1028
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:56,570
For making out of the jungle with this one.

1029
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:58,550
I don't, you guys, I don't think so.

1030
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:00,610
Oh, oh, chance?

1031
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:04,790
Wait, there, before in the background I said chance, but
this time it didn't.

1032
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:08,590
So maybe the chance is on, the...

1033
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:09,890
No, it's a miss.

1034
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:10,530
I don't know.

1035
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:14,270
What just happened?

1036
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:15,870
Oh.

1037
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,280
What?

1038
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,840
Grozny, I know.

1039
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,060
Oh, we get Sokolov again.

1040
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,260
What?

1041
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,220
This guy.

1042
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:41,460
After choosing difficulty, go back to front and push, knob
down a few times until the red number turns to zero.

1043
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:46,540
Just turn small key back off, and you're done.

1044
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,780
Thank you, Dave.

1045
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,080
I appreciate it.

1046
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,160
We never met, but I'm happy to see you're back.

1047
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:52,820
Thank you.

1048
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,460
I hope you're here to stay.

1049
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:55,860
I'm looking forward to seeing you more often.

1050
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,200
Thank you so much.

1051
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:01,400
Okay.

1052
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,620
What do you think, guys?

1053
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:03,860
What do you think?

1054
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,800
Sokolov is very inquisitive.

1055
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:06,280
Oh, my God.

1056
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:06,580
Yeah.

1057
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:11,320
It drives me like, you're the one burning those papers.

1058
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,960
What do you mean you don't know what's on it?

1059
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:14,060
Fork?

1060
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:14,860
Fork?

1061
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:15,260
Cigar?

1062
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,500
Cigar?

1063
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,240
Cigar?

1064
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:23,920
This is like, what's it called, family feud?

1065
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,600
The board says, Cigar!

1066
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,880
All on fork.

1067
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:37,720
Well, minty fresh Kyle, it's your minty fresh day.

1068
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,480
You better go play the lottery, buddy.

1069
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:44,460
Because who would have thought we got, we would get get fork
again.

1070
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,920
Oh my god, paramedic is so cute.

1071
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:52,580
Even when she's looking at my inside, don't look.

1072
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,260
Don't look at my pelvis.

1073
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,040
You'll see my sciatica.

1074
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:58,920
Or not my sciatica.

1075
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:00,360
You'll see my scoliosis.

1076
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,080
Oh my god, it's paramedic.

1077
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:08,400
She's like, I love that curve of your spine, snake.

1078
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,080
Bullets!

1079
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,460
I can't work every time.

1080
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:22,650
Scoliosis in your pelvis?

1081
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:23,450
No!

1082
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:26,650
Ooh, I like the effect it adds.

1083
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:28,270
Ooh, that is so cool, right?

1084
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:30,490
It's such a nice machine.

1085
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:31,850
It just looks so good.

1086
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:37,870
Unfortunately, mine is a little cracked up in the corner of
the snake.

1087
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:43,030
You can kind of see like the the breakage a little bit.

1088
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:53,800
But if I were to want to get it fixed, I would have to send
the entire thing back.

1089
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,940
And they would have to replace this whole panel.

1090
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:02,500
It would be, it's more of a pain in the ass than I'm willing
to deal with.

1091
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:08,760
So, tiger, tiger, tiger, tiger.

1092
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,720
Are you planning to buy more machines?

1093
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,960
No, I don't need more than one, unless I get what, Metal
Gear Arcade?

1094
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:21,560
I don't know if I'm that crazy, though.

1095
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:23,140
Here's another trick.

1096
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:27,720
There's a hidden set of patterns on the snake that tell you
when to push the buttons to get streaks.

1097
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,100
But you can only see it if you equip the...

1098
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,120
Stop lying to me!

1099
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,200
Don't lie!

1100
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,620
It's ugly.

1101
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,980
It's ugly when you lie on the internet.

1102
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,500
Don't tell lies.

1103
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,000
It makes you go bald.

1104
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:55,620
bald isn't ugly but if you like to have hair then it would
be kind of sad i'm just saying

1105
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:05,780
oh no my hair

1106
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:16,060
is the audio doubled or is it just the room uh yeah
unfortunately there's like some strange audio issues i'm

1107
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:24,420
having what a what a scuff stream to have as my first actual
stream back this is so i'm so sorry

1108
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:39,160
bald like sokolov so i think sokolov's i mean yeah he's a
little bald i think sokolov's bald

1109
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:51,060
it's perfect stream i'm loving it you guys are just saying
that to make me feel better you're just like we can't say

1110
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,330
bad things or else she'll she'll ghost us

1111
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:13,360
oh my god the curve of your spine oh baby i don't know why
it makes him look so old or oh sorry you can't really see it

1112
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:19,980
i guess um like there's it gives him like these weird smile
lines But I guess they're on a skull, huh?

1113
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:22,060
I don't know, I'm a ghost, not a skeleton.

1114
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:26,000
I'm a ghost, not a skeleton.

1115
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,340
Skeleton is old mint.

1116
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:38,400
It would be really fun to...

1117
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:42,780
Oh my gosh, what if we find my grave and we dig me up?

1118
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:43,460
Oh my gosh.

1119
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,660
You guys, what do you think I'm buried with?

1120
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,080
It's kind of embarrassing.

1121
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:54,860
Oh my gosh, what if you dig me up and you find my skeleton?

1122
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,800
Oh my gosh, what if you grave rob me?

1123
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:04,960
What if you open up my grave and I'm just gelatinous?

1124
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:05,980
Decomposing.

1125
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:14,660
I love hearing you have so much fun playing with the slot
machine.

1126
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,880
Eating Mike Tyson's bonnet, thank you!

1127
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:25,600
Let's do it!

1128
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,520
Very wormy.

1129
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:33,420
Oh my gosh, we're never making it out of the Russian job and
goals, you guys.

1130
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,320
I'm afraid to say.

1131
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:40,920
I changed the game mode, but I don't think it changed
anything.

1132
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,100
The legend.

1133
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,360
Thank you guys for all the donations.

1134
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:51,960
I really, really appreciate it.

1135
01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:08,260
man the myth legend uh for those who are like wondering
about um about memberships uh i don't get a monetization

1136
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:19,000
until i post three videos so this is the second one and then
it says i need more watch hours too so um i guess maybe

1137
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:31,160
sometime next week we'll get it hopefully I don't know I
still don't know what to do for memberships kind of I think

1138
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:44,930
uh um oh sorry I was I was thinking so much and I just ended
up pressing buttons uh love you man thank you thank you uh I

1139
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:56,110
um for uh cuz for memberships I I do plan on maybe doing
some streams um I'm gonna put it at like a lower tier though

1140
01:17:56,110 --> 01:18:07,370
because of the podcast and having the Patreon because Matara
and I will be doing some extra streams and games and things

1141
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:24,970
on there so that's a little bit more of my priority so my
memberships will be probably tiered much less but yeah so I

1142
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:32,570
do obviously still play to do stuff with memberships and
then there will be the emotes if you guys want that so less

1143
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:40,470
than five dollars less than five dollars is what i'm
thinking yeah like either two or three dollars so make them

1144
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:48,890
four forty four dollars are you crazy i thought you said
four four makes sense because obviously a spooky number but

1145
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:49,850
not 44.

1146
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:52,430
but yeah

1147
01:18:56,970 --> 01:19:00,410
Four, four, four, what a deal!

1148
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:03,290
No, a simp.

1149
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:06,770
We get out of the jungle when Delta releases.

1150
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:12,310
Yeah, maybe the game, maybe my patchy slot is feeling like a
little insecure.

1151
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:16,590
It's just like, you're gonna abandon me once Delta comes
out.

1152
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:19,150
You're not gonna love this snake anymore.

1153
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:21,170
You're gonna love other snake.

1154
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:23,110
He's gonna be even more high death.

1155
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:25,890
He looks so good though.

1156
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:27,370
Oh my gosh, she looks so awesome.

1157
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:29,330
Oh, you look so good.

1158
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:31,690
Everybody looks so good, except Eva, sorry.

1159
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:36,970
Eva in this, something about her just looks a little off.

1160
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:39,590
Like her hair looks a little wiry.

1161
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,230
Her face just looks a little off.

1162
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:44,010
I don't know what it is, I don't know.

1163
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:45,130
Sorry, Eva.

1164
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:48,910
Grave robbing membership stream.

1165
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:56,910
If we think you up and find your skeleton clutching a
suppressed H and KMK23 being a bag of cursed sad what is

1166
01:19:56,910 --> 01:19:58,210
this a reference to

1167
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:11,490
eva my wife i love eva i think um i'm very excited to see
how she looks in delta because how i and also ocelot looks a

1168
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:22,330
little weird in this too so it's not just her the two of
them look a little weird like hold on hold on hold on hold

1169
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:24,910
on hold on give me the menu hold on i'm gonna pay up.

1170
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:26,170
Not that it matters.

1171
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:27,970
We haven't done anything.

1172
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:28,730
Okay.

1173
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:31,290
Um, because you can see...

1174
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:34,830
No!

1175
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:39,590
Get me out of here!

1176
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:41,270
Okay, never mind.

1177
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:47,910
Um, they have a picture of Asala, which is why I wanted to
bring up the menu.

1178
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:50,190
He just looks a little goofy.

1179
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:01,400
Welcome back!

1180
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:02,020
Thank you!

1181
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:04,580
Thank you so much.

1182
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:05,840
Oh, hello, Sokolov.

1183
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,140
How does the boss look?

1184
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,180
She looks perfect.

1185
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:15,240
Oh my god.

1186
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:16,240
She looks...

1187
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,880
Like, her and Snake?

1188
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,820
I feel like they had the most love put into them.

1189
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,780
I mean, the other bosses look into.

1190
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,160
But, uh, her and...

1191
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,800
Oh, her and Snake looks stupidly good.

1192
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,980
They look So perfect.

1193
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:35,800
I'm going to throw you into that fire.

1194
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,580
If you don't say something else, please.

1195
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,900
I think I'm turning into the Joker.

1196
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:41,380
Oh my god, no, please.

1197
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:42,480
Don't say it.

1198
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,180
Don't say it.

1199
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:44,140
Don't you dare.

1200
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,000
Don't say it.

1201
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,080
Don't say it.

1202
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:47,540
No!

1203
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:59,920
There's an Umineko patchy slot for 250 right now in Nara and
you're making it really hard for me to not hit by.

1204
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,780
That's not a bad price at all.

1205
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:13,480
all i think with this patchy slot i can't i i have never
played any other patchy slot games before um oh that's well

1206
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:20,700
patchy slot is true i have tried like a pachinko machine at
a convention before a long time ago and it was whatever i

1207
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:30,800
don't even remember like what anime series it was if it even
was one but um i feel like a considerable amount of effort

1208
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:41,420
went into wind into this one i don't know there's just a lot
going on and obviously you have like the hd graphic so it

1209
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:55,920
just feels like a lot of love not love maybe that's the
wrong word a lot of something effort effort went into this

1210
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,520
Sorry, I'm trying to choose my words carefully.

1211
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,240
Sorry, I'm just trying to choose my words carefully.

1212
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,940
Oh, go, go, go!

1213
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,300
That's what I'm trying to do.

1214
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:17,420
Please, let me through.

1215
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,500
Oh, my God, finally.

1216
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:21,780
Something has happened.

1217
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:23,280
Oh, my God.

1218
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:24,480
Please.

1219
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:26,460
Please.

1220
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:27,660
Please.

1221
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,500
Let me go somewhere else.

1222
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,600
for once.

1223
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,780
Oh my god, I'm so tired.

1224
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,700
Don't say it.

1225
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,880
Don't say it.

1226
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,840
Don't say it.

1227
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:06,750
This is like probably the worst round we've we've gotten so
far.

1228
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:10,730
If I get the chance, I'm gonna maybe change the game mode
again.

1229
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:11,570
Okay, guys.

1230
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:19,270
This is gonna become a meme on my channel.

1231
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:21,430
Like everybody, something happens.

1232
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:23,030
Nanda, this is.

1233
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:28,670
All right, everybody, place your bets.

1234
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:30,950
Cigar, I really want the cigar.

1235
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:33,490
I don't think I know what he says when he get the cigar.

1236
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:37,490
When you get the fork, he says, like, I don't need this
right now.

1237
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:45,550
H&K MK23 is the Socom pistol from the game.

1238
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:46,990
Are you sure you're a Metal Gear fan?

1239
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:47,890
No, I knew that.

1240
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:54,510
I didn't know what the bag of dirt or whatever they said
was.

1241
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:55,190
I didn't know.

1242
01:24:58,290 --> 01:24:59,170
All right.

1243
01:24:59,510 --> 01:24:59,950
Sikar!

1244
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:01,750
Oh, yeah.

1245
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:03,470
Yeah, he says I don't need it right now.

1246
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:12,110
ration he says like not bad ammunition I don't remember what
he says because I haven't gotten it enough times and cigar

1247
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:25,950
and key I have no idea and then obviously the secret I have
no idea forked get forked again nerd tiger straw you guys

1248
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:34,830
I'm starting to lose hope I'm starting to lose hope please a
lot my love.

1249
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:36,250
Really?

1250
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:39,970
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, another chance.

1251
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:42,250
Chance, chance.

1252
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:46,490
Forked again.

1253
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:51,630
I'm getting forked in the butt here, man.

1254
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:56,670
Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay, come on, come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1255
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:58,510
Come on, come on.

1256
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:00,950
Mama, Nana.

1257
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:05,920
Tigers trying.

1258
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:07,740
Why always fork?

1259
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,000
I think because it's like the worst result.

1260
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,000
Okay, what did that mean?

1261
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:19,020
I don't know.

1262
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,320
I don't know anything that goes on in this.

1263
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:24,960
I literally just push buttons and I pray.

1264
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:27,640
I pray something is going to happen.

1265
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:32,040
Can I get the menu again, please?

1266
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:35,940
Paramedic, please.

1267
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:39,720
Oh!

1268
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:40,240
Oh!

1269
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:42,790
Oh, we haven't gotten this one.

1270
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,360
Oh, now we got caught!

1271
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:47,260
Oh, no!

1272
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:11,000
It's gonna go into caution after this though.

1273
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:12,220
Oh.

1274
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:14,480
Bullets!

1275
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:16,280
Nice, nice, nice.

1276
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:16,980
Nice, nice.

1277
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:20,080
Nope.

1278
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:23,160
Just, uh, just a tree.

1279
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:28,700
Oh, the tree is in the way now.

1280
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,240
That's what I get for...

1281
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,120
For cosplaying a tree, he took offense.

1282
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:39,280
Alright, get out of here, run away, you losers.

1283
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:47,440
Oh my god, the music is so awesome.

1284
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:53,120
Okay, now we're in caution.

1285
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:56,340
What the hell?

1286
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,960
I think the Umaku part is difficult.

1287
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:21,260
He's so thick.

1288
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:22,700
My God.

1289
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:23,880
He is...

1290
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:24,100
He is...

1291
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:24,740
I'm so...

1292
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:30,120
How thick did they have to make this tree to allow him to
stand behind it?

1293
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:31,500
Like this guy.

1294
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:33,760
Look at the size of him.

1295
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:34,900
I can't even...

1296
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:37,320
I can barely fit my fingers.

1297
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,340
His length, like it's crazy!

1298
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:41,620
Oh, dang it!

1299
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:42,900
Oh, I just realized it was on.

1300
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:44,300
Oh, I missed it.

1301
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:45,960
We're still in caution mode.

1302
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:48,720
The music is so awesome, right?

1303
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:52,040
Absolute unit.

1304
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,280
That's what I'm saying.

1305
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:00,530
Snake been eating good.

1306
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:02,790
Fit your fingers where?

1307
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:04,630
Like a...

1308
01:29:05,870 --> 01:29:06,390
To...

1309
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:06,410
To...

1310
01:29:06,410 --> 01:29:07,190
Like a...

1311
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:08,650
Like a ruler, right?

1312
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:12,370
What did I say?

1313
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:13,490
Wait, now I'm scared.

1314
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:15,650
Wait, what did I say?

1315
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:17,850
Does the bottom screen do anything?

1316
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:19,230
No, it's all one screen.

1317
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:24,010
It's just for decoration.

1318
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:35,770
So, um, but when, uh, when we get theater mode, if, if we
get theater mode, if we get theater mode, it will be on the

1319
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:36,370
whole thing.

1320
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:38,250
So that's really awesome.

1321
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:41,210
That's when it shows like the...

1322
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:46,290
It plays Snake Eater and shows like the scenes from the game
while you play.

1323
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:49,450
Cross of my fingers.

1324
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:54,070
Safety!

1325
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:59,830
Yeah, I'm hungry.

1326
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:03,630
Okay, you're not gonna do anything about it.

1327
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:06,530
It's pretty cool you own something like this.

1328
01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:07,550
Thanks.

1329
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:22,010

absolute sense come on streamer look I don't think there is

1334
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:09,110
these winds you know but you make sure you're hydrated too
when you're having a bad day are you more of the type of

1335
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:16,970
ghost to go to the bar and drown your sorrows and booze or
the type to haunt elevators to try to lift your spirits.

1336
01:31:20,390 --> 01:31:20,930
Boo!

1337
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:22,630
Boo!

1338
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:27,760
Increasing the patchy slot luck.

1339
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:29,540
Thank you, thank you, Amelia.

1340
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:30,800
Thank you.

1341
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:31,500
Not that quiet.

1342
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:35,940
Oh my God, how did you predict that?

1343
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,180
Here he is.

1344
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:38,920
He's not gonna say it though.

1345
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,000
Never mind.

1346
01:31:49,390 --> 01:31:55,050
I posted it in a tweet, but I basically said you're just
gonna be getting a lot of this.

1347
01:31:56,330 --> 01:32:00,890
And when the exciting stuff happens, it's fun, but it is a
lot of this.

1348
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:03,490
Can I please get the menu?

1349
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:05,730
Please can I get the menu?

1350
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:08,170
Can I please get the menu?

1351
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:10,330
Please?

1352
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:12,970
Actually, I'm gonna pay out.

1353
01:32:13,290 --> 01:32:13,510
Okay.

1354
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:16,250
Oh wait, I'll do it after this.

1355
01:32:19,190 --> 01:32:22,050
If I go to the menu now...

1356
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:25,130
Okay, let's try...

1357
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:26,030
Wait, what are we on?

1358
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:28,050
I think we're on...

1359
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:30,390
Okay, we're on normal mode.

1360
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:33,210
So let's try classic mode.

1361
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:35,310
Again.

1362
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:36,730
We tried it before.

1363
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:39,250
But let's try it again.

1364
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:40,030
I don't know.

1365
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:41,790
Maybe it'll help a little bit.

1366
01:32:42,330 --> 01:32:43,890
We had a lucky streak at the start.

1367
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:44,570
I know!

1368
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:49,310
It started so strong!

1369
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:56,270
You think that the game would just start to pity me at some
point?

1370
01:32:57,470 --> 01:32:57,910
Snow.

1371
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:01,550
You switched into classic?

1372
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:03,350
Yeah, we were on...

1373
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:05,550
Oh, you were on classic.

1374
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:06,210
Oh, I what?

1375
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:11,430
We started on normal then moved to classic and then...

1376
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:12,390
Now on classic again.

1377
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:14,530
Oh, wait, so I should switch...

1378
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:16,210
I should switch to normal then.

1379
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:20,910
I should switch it to normal then.

1380
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:24,210
Sorry, I thought I was on classic before.

1381
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:26,250
Or normal before.

1382
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:27,890
Try advanced.

1383
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:29,570
What if it's so difficult?

1384
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:38,010
So this is why when, like, some people have asked me, like,
when I say, like, oh, yeah, I have this metal gear.

1385
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:39,030
Pachi slot.

1386
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:43,070
People have asked me before, like, have you beaten it?

1387
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:45,130
Like, and I'm like, no.

1388
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:48,870
This is what I get every time.

1389
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:53,770
This is what I'm dealing with.

1390
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:58,630
Hi Paramount Inc.

1391
01:33:59,610 --> 01:34:00,110
Oh my god.

1392
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:02,450
Look at the curve.

1393
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:04,630
Oh, we're blue now.

1394
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:04,990
Okay.

1395
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:06,030
This is looking good.

1396
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:06,650
Right?

1397
01:34:07,010 --> 01:34:08,010
This is all different.

1398
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:09,190
Oh, not different.

1399
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:10,710
Oh, we got some bullets.

1400
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:11,610
Okay.

1401
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:12,990
This is looking different.

1402
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:13,710
This is looking good.

1403
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:20,410
You keep getting so close.

1404
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:22,250
I feel like it.

1405
01:34:23,150 --> 01:34:24,330
This game hates me.

1406
01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:26,370
Come on, please.

1407
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:30,780
What?

1408
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:38,560
Oh my gosh, okay.

1409
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:44,100
I don't remember what this is.

1410
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,760
And I can't read it.

1411
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:53,640
I can read it, but I don't know what the,

1412
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:58,320
what it means.

1413
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:04,860
Someone Nihongo Jozu more than me can read it.

1414
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:08,660
Someone how, someone how.

1415
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:13,240
Pull out the translator.

1416
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:14,540
It's too blurry?

1417
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:16,680
Oh yeah, you probably can't even see it.

1418
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,260
Oh yeah, because it's highlighted?

1419
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:25,140
There you go.

1420
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:31,520
I hate kanji, sorry.

1421
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:39,180
Navi custom?

1422
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:40,760
No, that's not the one.

1423
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:47,830
Kanji is the enemy.

1424
01:35:48,230 --> 01:35:50,530
It's still too, but wait, no, someone, that's it.

1425
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:52,390
That's good.

1426
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:05,300
Try plugging your controller into the second slot.

1427
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:12,020
Okay, so is it red how I thought it would be red?

1428
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:14,600
But I don't understand what it means.

1429
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:19,660
Okay, I'm just gonna try clicking it.

1430
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:20,680
Oh my gosh, CLI.

1431
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,060
Oh, I clicked the exit button.

1432
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,020
Oh wait, okay, we can see.

1433
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:28,200
Oh!

1434
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:29,220
Oh!

1435
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:42,280
that's right yes it shows you the different okay so if you
get any of these combinations you get to try again and if

1436
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:51,920
you I don't understand what the what the seven or three like
the Q my Samayar I don't really understand what they mean

1437
01:36:51,920 --> 01:37:01,390
like I guess maybe credits I don't really get it I have no
idea the odds yeah But like, I don't know.

1438
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:06,440
Multipliers.

1439
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:07,660
Oh, maybe.

1440
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:11,220
Maybe, maybe.

1441
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:14,720
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

1442
01:37:18,850 --> 01:37:19,510
Okay.

1443
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:20,670
All right.

1444
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:22,370
Okay.

1445
01:37:22,890 --> 01:37:25,030
Oh, we're in the underground this time.

1446
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:26,470
Okay.

1447
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:28,430
Oh.

1448
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:30,730
Okay.

1449
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:36,710
Yeah, just your imagination.

1450
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:39,310
Just your imagination.

1451
01:37:40,210 --> 01:37:42,890
Yeah, yeah, you were wrong at the pier.

1452
01:37:43,210 --> 01:37:43,570
You're wrong.

1453
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:49,660
Are you kidding me?

1454
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:55,300
This is...

1455
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:57,520
This is so cruel.

1456
01:37:58,400 --> 01:37:59,860
This is...

1457
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,980
This is...

1458
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:02,400
Oh!

1459
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:05,360
This is...

1460
01:38:05,860 --> 01:38:07,420
This is painful.

1461
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:09,440
This is painful.

1462
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,480
Why are you guys even watching this?

1463
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:15,800
Why are you watching my pain and my suffering and my losing?

1464
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:25,200
We like pain.

1465
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:35,840
Insanity is doing the same thing over.

1466
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:39,340
and over and over again and never changing.

1467
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:47,380
I am a simp for Metal Gear.

1468
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:55,680
Nanda, this is not even the right quote.

1469
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:56,560
Whatever.

1470
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,180
It doesn't matter.

1471
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:01,900
Isn't this supposed to be pay to win?

1472
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:03,340
Oh, nice, Hank.

1473
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:06,640
cool

1474
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:14,100
Isn't this supposed to be pay to it?

1475
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:19,380
Hornet stride

1476
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:36,700
Very cool Yeah, take him out Okay Oh, oh never mind we are
Got demoted.

1477
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:46,100
Okay guys, cigar, cigar, cigar, cigar, cigar, cigar.

1478
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:49,680
Get forked.

1479
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,900
Fork, fork, fork.

1480
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:57,880
Oh,

1481
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:05,220
we're red now and I don't know why.

1482
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:08,020
Doesn't even matter how hard you try.

1483
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:09,320
Give them my...

1484
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:10,040
Okay.

1485
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:12,120
Okay, okay.

1486
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:13,660
Maybe the game feels bad for me now.

1487
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,140
We're back in the underground.

1488
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:19,660
Our camouflage is 30%, which is not great.

1489
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:26,440
Thank you for the...

1490
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:33,660
The greatest engineer of the USSR's nascent space age
looking at his own blueprints.

1491
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:35,480
That's what I'm saying.

1492
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:36,420
It's your...

1493
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:37,400
They're your papers.

1494
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:38,000
Why?

1495
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,420
Why do you not know what it is?

1496
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:44,300
Okay, all right, come on.

1497
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:45,020
Come on.

1498
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:46,060
Please.

1499
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:47,940
What?

1500
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,920
But I'm going through it all wrong.

1501
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:24,470
If you're a ghost in your pain, does that make it the fact
pain yeah it's literally rigged oh my gosh this is this is

1504
01:41:48,910 --> 01:41:49,230
What?

1505
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:52,070
Why did that guy just fly across the screen?

1506
01:41:55,170 --> 01:41:57,030
I don't know what happened.

1507
01:41:57,930 --> 01:41:58,230
Okay.

1508
01:41:58,590 --> 01:41:58,990
Wait, what?

1509
01:42:00,510 --> 01:42:01,750
One of those annoying guys.

1510
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:05,030
Cigar, cigar, cigar!

1511
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:07,270
GIF worked.

1512
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:11,250
This game is so rigged.

1513
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:15,590
This game is so rigged!

1514
01:42:18,110 --> 01:42:18,550
Nice!

1515
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:24,630
Okay, that's closer to the family guy pose.

1516
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:26,450
Fork and bye.

1517
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:27,890
Oh!

1518
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:34,170
We're progressing maybe.

1519
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:36,710
Where's the jackpot?

1520
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:37,990
I don't know!

1521
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:39,950
I don't!

1522
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:41,430
I don't know!

1523
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:44,330
I don't know anything anymore!

1524
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:46,650
I don't know!

1525
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:59,320
What was that?

1526
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,900
I've never had that before either.

1527
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:05,300
What's going on?

1528
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:07,440
Hi, B.

1529
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:11,020
I was

1530
01:43:16,330 --> 01:43:17,410
so shocked he said something else.

1531
01:43:17,490 --> 01:43:18,290
I don't even know what he said.

1532
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:27,600
Oh my god, we can finally progress.

1533
01:43:30,860 --> 01:43:32,100
He actually remembered.

1534
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:36,640
The progress is none.

1535
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:38,280
Okay, 50% camouflage.

1536
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:40,800
Okay, all right.

1537
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:44,120
Okay.

1538
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:51,960
It's 50-50 chance, you guys.

1539
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:56,040
And honestly, I'll be honest, 50-50 is never on my side.

1540
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:00,020
Please.

1541
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:02,420
Please, I just...

1542
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:04,520
Okay, nice.

1543
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:05,980
Thank you for the don't know.

1544
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,280
Thanks for sharing your brain rot with us.

1545
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:09,300
Thank you!

1546
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:11,700
Okay.

1547
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:16,120
Come on.

1548
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:16,600
What?

1549
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:17,100
What?

1550
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:17,480
What?

1551
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:21,960
What's going on!

1552
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:43,650
Oh, push.

1553
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:44,290
Oh, shit!

1554
01:44:44,430 --> 01:44:45,090
I missed it.

1555
01:44:45,370 --> 01:44:45,610
Sorry.

1556
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:46,310
I didn't mean to curse.

1557
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:47,130
No!

1558
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:48,250
That was too close.

1559
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:49,070
I was too slow.

1560
01:44:49,770 --> 01:44:50,010
Okay.

1561
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:52,010
I have to look at this machine.

1562
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:53,050
I can't look at...

1563
01:44:53,050 --> 01:44:56,710
There's a slight delay when I look at it through the
computer.

1564
01:44:57,570 --> 01:44:57,990
So...

1565
01:44:58,010 --> 01:44:58,910
Okay, goodbye.

1566
01:44:59,230 --> 01:44:59,490
All right.

1567
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:01,510
Come on.

1568
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:02,020
Come on.

1569
01:45:02,770 --> 01:45:03,350
Come on.

1570
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:04,370
Oh god.

1571
01:45:04,710 --> 01:45:05,850
There's a timer here.

1572
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:06,410
I have five.

1573
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:06,890
Five.

1574
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:09,950
It says last game down there.

1575
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:13,430
Do something.

1576
01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:17,170
Yeah!

1577
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:18,530
Me.

1578
01:45:19,870 --> 01:45:20,690
Oh my god.

1579
01:45:21,430 --> 01:45:21,670
Oh my god.

1580
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:22,410
Oh my god.

1581
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:23,790
Nice.

1582
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:24,510
Nice.

1583
01:45:24,970 --> 01:45:25,530
Push, push.

1584
01:45:26,310 --> 01:45:26,810
Oh dang.

1585
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:27,770
Dang, dang, dang.

1586
01:45:28,010 --> 01:45:32,350
We only have two tries left though.

1587
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:33,710
One more?

1588
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:35,030
Uh oh.

1589
01:45:35,890 --> 01:45:36,750
One more?

1590
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:39,010
Oh no.

1591
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:42,230
One, two, three, push!

1592
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:45,370
Suddenly

1593
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:55,580
we're back here.

1594
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:57,540
What just happened?

1595
01:45:58,520 --> 01:45:59,480
What?

1596
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:01,640
The cliffhanger.

1597
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:03,560
What?

1598
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:05,120
What?

1599
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:06,380
What just happened?

1600
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:12,660
I think maybe we lost because we didn't get the helicopter.

1601
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:16,620
This is the Metal Gear experience I remember.

1602
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,040
Hope you have a good time.

1603
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:19,140
Thank you.

1604
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:20,980
Oh.

1605
01:46:26,660 --> 01:46:27,420
Oh.

1606
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:28,960
Oh.

1607
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:30,340
Oh.

1608
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,180
Oh.

1609
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:37,500
Oh, the jungle.

1610
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:50,900
The jungle in the jungle, a mighty jungle, a lion sleeps
tonight.

1611
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:54,780
It's the colonel.

1612
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:55,940
I mean, not the colonel.

1613
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:56,580
It's the major.

1614
01:46:57,640 --> 01:47:00,100
It's, wait, down here, it turned to the major.

1615
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:02,640
Instead of a snake.

1616
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:03,860
Why?

1617
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:05,120
Wait.

1618
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:06,620
I have so good fears.

1619
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:07,400
Oh!

1620
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:11,300
Exclamation point.

1621
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:14,560
Something's...

1622
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,400
Something is going on.

1623
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:17,120
What is going on?

1624
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,040
What is going on?

1625
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:18,440
Me too.

1626
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:19,380
I don't know.

1627
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,060
What the hell?

1628
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:27,260
Chance!

1629
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:31,600
Okay.

1630
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:32,920
Thank you.

1631
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:35,060
Oh, okay.

1632
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:38,960
Wait, what?

1633
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:39,960
What's going on?

1634
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:41,360
What's going on?

1635
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:41,960
What's going on?

1636
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:42,660
Oh, my God, please.

1637
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:43,480
What's going on?

1638
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:45,560
What's going on?

1639
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:46,800
You guys, what's going on?

1640
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:49,420
No, please.

1641
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:52,500
What happened?

1642
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:54,000
No.

1643
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:03,690
Everything is happening all at once.

1644
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:04,520
I'm so...

1645
01:48:07,370 --> 01:48:11,710
In the jungle, the mighty jungle.

1646
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:16,370
The lion sleeps tonight.

1647
01:48:17,730 --> 01:48:18,210
Oh,

1648
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:30,850
five, six, seven, oh, nine.

1649
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:33,250
Hatay!

1650
01:48:35,190 --> 01:48:36,430
Let's go, okay.

1651
01:48:38,130 --> 01:48:38,910
The escape!

1652
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:40,650
Okay, I think we can do this one, though.

1653
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:41,730
We don't need camouflage.

1654
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:43,690
Right?

1655
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:45,250
It's, we're running for our lives.

1656
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:49,950
Okay, chance, chance, chance, chance!

1657
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:50,310
Nice.

1658
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:52,590
Stupid dogs.

1659
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:54,630
Bye-bye!

1660
01:48:57,230 --> 01:48:58,170
Pass a lot.

1661
01:48:58,610 --> 01:49:01,850
If you loved me, you'd let me go.

1662
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:04,490
Oh, again?

1663
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:05,670
Okay, guys.

1664
01:49:06,110 --> 01:49:06,930
Let's survive this time.

1665
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:09,890
Yeah!

1666
01:49:10,830 --> 01:49:11,070
Did

1667
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:19,300
the wrong order on accident?

1668
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,300
Two, thank you!

1669
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:22,040
Okay.

1670
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,020
Okay.

1671
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:25,460
Nice!

1672
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:28,180
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1673
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:29,180
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1674
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:31,760
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1675
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:34,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay, okay.

1676
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:40,460
It's okay.

1677
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:45,160
We've got three chances, I guess, for the, for the, uh, for
the helicopter.

1678
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:46,140
Okay.

1679
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:49,440
I'm sweating, I'm sweating, I'm sweating, I'm sweating.

1680
01:49:52,580 --> 01:49:52,980
Nice.

1681
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:56,060
Yes, yes, yes.

1682
01:49:56,060 --> 01:50:02,180
This is a good thing.

1683
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:03,960
Oh, okay.

1684
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:05,240
Come on, come on.

1685
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,880
Come on.

1686
01:50:08,980 --> 01:50:09,800
Come on.

1687
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:10,060
Come on.

1688
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:17,060
Come on.

1689
01:50:29,330 --> 01:50:31,170
Oh, okay.

1690
01:50:31,850 --> 01:50:32,430
One more.

1691
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:44,600
Cool finger.

1692
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,040

1693
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,240
You guys.

1694
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:00,680
Zero, I can't do anything.

1695
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:01,660
I can't...

1696
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:04,780
No, there is a problem here, Snake!

1697
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:05,240
Please!

1698
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:08,180
We need to...

1699
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:16,660
This game is hard.

1700
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:17,260
I know.

1701
01:51:17,660 --> 01:51:24,980
It really is like so tough when I try to describe to people
like, wow, that was so cool.

1702
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:29,220
When I try to describe to people like, it is not easy.

1703
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:30,500
Get it?

1704
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,580
I mean, it's just me.

1705
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:32,500
I have no idea.

1706
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:33,860
We're stuck in a loop.

1707
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:41,790
Oh, ew.

1708
01:51:42,810 --> 01:51:46,830
Oh, snake thinks about his food.

1709
01:51:47,570 --> 01:51:48,250
Oh, a grenade!

1710
01:51:49,050 --> 01:51:49,250

Joker.

1715
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,780
I think the game is actually feeling bad for me.

1716
01:52:58,220 --> 01:53:01,200
I think the game is actually starting to pity me a little
bit.

1717
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:03,020
No more progress.

1718
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,320

01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:05,620
Come on, come on, come on.

01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:00,600
Isn't it so awesome?

1758
01:55:07,180 --> 01:55:08,060
Thank you, Iba.

1759
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,980
See, she just looks a little off.

1760
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:12,180
I don't know what it is.

1761
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:13,700
There's just something.

1762
01:55:27,190 --> 01:55:28,610
The new eyebrows?

1763
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:29,830
Maybe that's it.

1764
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:31,010
Maybe that's it.

1765
01:55:31,310 --> 01:55:31,490
Maybe.

1766
01:55:34,750 --> 01:55:37,050
Oh, Major Zero.

1767
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:40,150
His neck here is insane.

1768
01:55:42,190 --> 01:55:43,510
But he looks awesome here.

1769
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,560
Here, I'll shut up a little bit.

1770
01:55:55,580 --> 01:55:57,680
So yeah, you guys can hear the audio a little bit better.

1771
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:01,580
But neck, I don't.

1772
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:06,720
The Jinju dirty in Major Zero.

1773
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:13,580
Oh my god, what he says?

1774
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:14,780
He said to the...

1775
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:15,580
I felt that.

1776
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:28,800
Remember the basis of CQC?

1777
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,040
I punched the slot machine.

1778
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:31,680
Strong as goes, thank you!

1779
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:39,960
Thank you, Asilot.

1780
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:45,800
It's so cute, you get like little intros of everybody.

1781
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:56,460
I love the N's Japanese voice.

1782
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:57,740
I love it so much.

1783
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:01,460
He just sounds like the perfect old man.

1784
01:57:03,380 --> 01:57:04,440
He looks so good.

1785
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:05,060
Oh my gosh.

1786
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:07,420
I've never actually have seen his mod.

1787
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:17,160
so much his hair looks like an actual it looks he looks like
a scarecrow like it is it's so stringy sorry if the quality

1788

flashing where's my cat my gay cat boy son patience

1789
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:34,900
hopefully he comes home actually because these are random
too you don't always get the same characters.

1790
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:35,980
Ow!

1791
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:38,360
Yeah!

1792
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:47,300

1794
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:49,740
Oh my god, he looks so good!

1795
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:50,240
Oh, his eyes!

1796
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:52,060
Oh my god, he looks so high, so...

1797
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:53,260
Oh my god, I can't wait for Delta.

1798
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:58,520
This bonus version music of the MGS3 is groovy!

1799
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:00,440
Yeah, it's cool.

1800
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:04,260
I love bonus time!

1801
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:05,080

01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:24,420
Oh my god, he looks so good.

1803
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:26,140
Oh my god, hi.

1804
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:28,480
Oh my god.

1805
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:30,080
Oh my god, sorry.

1806
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:32,740
Oh my god, oh my god.

1807
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:35,860
Nice, maybe.

1808
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:39,120
Oh my gosh, sorry, I was so...

1809
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:41,520
He looks so good!

1810
01:58:41,540 --> 01:58:41,800
Oh!

1811
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:00,800
You guys, we got it!

1812
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:03,800
No!

1813
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:18,800
It only took...

1814
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:19,800
Two hours!

1815
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:21,360
Oh my god.

1816
01:59:25,690 --> 01:59:27,010
Oh my god.

1817
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:28,110
I'm gonna go a little slower.

1818
01:59:28,130 --> 01:59:29,830
so it plays as much as possible.

1819
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:30,770
Oh my god.

1820
01:59:33,590 --> 01:59:38,390
Down here is just like so.

1821
01:59:38,710 --> 01:59:39,290
Ah!

1822
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:46,820
Fuck you!

1823
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:48,440
I'm so sorry.

1824
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:51,940
That guy is my trauma.

1825
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:02,980
Ah, he looks so good!

1826
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:05,260
Oh my god.

1827
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:08,660
This is exactly why I bought this machine.

1828
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:11,300
Oh, I love that.

1829
02:00:13,020 --> 02:00:16,920
Oh, the walking is with the switch between the scenes.

1830
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:18,040
It's so good.

1831
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:21,360
Oh, man.

1832
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:27,100
Someday you go through the rain.

1833
02:00:28,940 --> 02:00:30,140
Someday you'll be...

1834
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:31,400
Sorry, I'm not even looking at chat.

1835
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:33,540
I can't just, I just can't stop looking.

1836
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:38,280
You look so goofy.

1837
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:44,140
Oh, she looks so perfect.

1838
02:00:44,860 --> 02:00:45,800
Oh my god.

1839
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:48,500
Oh gosh, she looks so perfect.

1840
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:54,020
Oh my god, she looks so good.

1841
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:02,600
Tense!

1842
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:10,140
Rank?

1843
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:10,460
Oh!

1844
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:11,800
I don't know what that means.

1845
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:21,850
Rykov looks so cool too.

1846
02:01:26,110 --> 02:01:26,710
Oh,

1847
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:33,050
she looks good there.

1848
02:01:35,450 --> 02:01:38,390
And then I have repeats so that you can get all the...

1849
02:01:39,650 --> 02:01:47,770

get here We can watch it as many times as we want.

1852
02:02:14,170 --> 02:02:17,790
But I have to do this patchy slot part or else it doesn't
continue.

1853
02:02:19,530 --> 02:02:21,830
It'll end up like the music will end up fading.

1854
02:02:24,390 --> 02:02:25,470
It was worth it.

1855
02:02:27,110 --> 02:02:29,250
Oh, what did you do?

1856
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:31,390

Sorry, here you go.

1865
02:03:11,330 --> 02:03:11,950
You can see it.

1866
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:14,130
I shouldn't put my hand on the screen.

1867
02:03:14,430 --> 02:03:15,130
So you can...

1868
02:03:15,130 --> 02:03:16,070
I'm like, look at it!

1869
02:03:16,090 --> 02:03:17,890
Isn't my machine so beautiful?

1871
02:03:19,190 --> 02:03:20,830
Aren't the cutscenes so nice?

1872
02:03:20,970 --> 02:03:23,610
With my hand, like, blocking everything.

1873
02:03:27,510 --> 02:03:29,530
Oh, Snake looks so awesome.

1874
02:03:37,510 --> 02:03:38,310
Mystery!

1875
02:03:40,610 --> 02:03:41,410

Thank you!

1883
02:04:19,070 --> 02:04:20,830
You've surpassed even the bonus.

1884
02:04:21,730 --> 02:04:23,850
We award you the title, Big Bonus.

1885
02:04:24,550 --> 02:04:27,670
I know the big bonus came out of nowhere, you guys.

1886
02:04:27,790 --> 02:04:31,670
We had regular bonus, and then they awarded us Big Bonus!

1887
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:35,430
Maybe the game loves us after all.

1888
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:43,210
I feel like if we weren't watching you, Watching you would
smooch the screen, which is okay, I would too.

1889
02:04:45,790 --> 02:04:46,670
Yeah, maybe.

1890
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:48,230
Maybe.

1891
02:04:52,490 --> 02:04:55,390
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't get over how cute Ryukawa looks.

1892
02:04:57,810 --> 02:05:07,930
Like, if there was a good remake, not a good one, well, if
there was a, like, a new, a re, rather, a remake of MGS2, I

1893
02:05:07,930 --> 02:05:09,590
guess, would Ryden look like that?

1894
02:05:10,430 --> 02:05:12,590
He'd be so cute.

1895
02:05:15,990 --> 02:05:17,870
Yeah, like a Delta remake.

1896
02:05:19,550 --> 02:05:22,230
Not that I, oh, oops, sorry, Osla, I wasn't paying
attention.

1897
02:05:23,910 --> 02:05:29,350
Not that I want that, but it's fun to see how Bryden would
maybe look.

1898
02:05:45,010 --> 02:05:46,570
Okay, we only have 16 left.

1899
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:50,090
Look at our total get.

1900
02:05:50,090 --> 02:05:52,110

It's very good.

1910
02:06:32,910 --> 02:06:33,870
The art is so awesome.

1911
02:06:34,230 --> 02:06:36,270
Oh, oh, oh.

Okay.

02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:37,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1920
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:38,940
Okay, two more, two more.

1921
02:07:38,940 --> 02:07:39,540
Okay.

Okay, here we go.

1928
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:40,340
Oh, you can see it's the whole thing.

1929
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:43,300
It looks

1930
02:08:52,060 --> 02:08:54,060
so good.

1931
02:08:58,380 --> 02:08:59,480
It looks so good.

1932
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:03,100
It just looks so good.

1933
02:09:20,010 --> 02:09:22,130
The thing is, he doesn't flip here.

1934
02:09:22,390 --> 02:09:23,510
It's actually quite disappointing.

1935
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:25,050
But it looks so good.

1936
02:09:25,410 --> 02:09:26,510

It looks way too good.

1942
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:41,810
Oh Like it almost looks like it's not a game.

1943
02:09:41,910 --> 02:09:44,730
It almost looks like real footage sometimes like it's kind
of scary

1944
02:09:48,930 --> 02:09:50,410
Graphics on a slap machine.

1945
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:52,430

02:13:39,050 --> 02:13:39,310
Okay.

1987
02:13:41,070 --> 02:13:41,630
Where are we?

1988
02:13:41,930 --> 02:13:44,870
It's like, you know, like, you know.

1989
02:13:45,670 --> 02:13:45,890
Okay.

1990
02:13:46,150 --> 02:13:46,830
Three bars.

1991
02:13:47,950 --> 02:13:48,170
Right?

1992
02:13:48,610 --> 02:13:49,590
And that's how much damage?

1993
02:13:49,950 --> 02:13:50,110
Okay.

1994
02:13:53,290 --> 02:13:55,410
Oh, this is my life bar.

1995
02:13:55,650 --> 02:13:56,450
I forgot to mention.

1996
02:13:56,910 --> 02:13:58,370
I have four shots.

1997
02:13:59,030 --> 02:14:03,710
So if he hits me four times, we start the whole game over.

1998
02:14:03,810 --> 02:14:18,910
okay and he has three bars do you understand why now I've
never beaten this game before do you understand I've never

1999
02:14:18,910 --> 02:14:28,190
beaten a boss battle ever I don't think there's a way to
heal if there is I have no idea what it is if there's a way

2000
02:14:28,190 --> 02:14:31,790
to heal so um

2001
02:14:35,310 --> 02:14:36,010
Stuck grenade?

2002
02:14:36,110 --> 02:14:36,670

02:14:52,790 --> 02:14:53,730
Why is it even already?

2009
02:14:53,830 --> 02:14:55,770
I think it would have been even better if we got the orange
nest.

2010
02:14:59,710 --> 02:15:02,310
Why does Ocelad's voice fit him so perfectly?

2011
02:15:03,970 --> 02:15:07,990

Rush.

2022
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:26,190
Oh, my god.

2023
02:15:27,070 --> 02:15:28,370
Oh, we're back to even.

2024
02:15:28,750 --> 02:15:28,950
Okay.

2025
02:15:29,710 --> 02:15:29,970
Ooh.

2026
02:15:30,950 --> 02:15:31,510
Okay.

2027
02:15:31,950 --> 02:15:33,790
We're about, we're about...

2028
02:15:33,810 --> 02:15:39,950
a little under 50% or rather a little over 50% for his
health.

2029
02:15:41,610 --> 02:15:43,170
And we still don't have any hits on us.

2030
02:15:43,410 --> 02:15:44,470
So that's a tumbleweed.

2031
02:15:45,150 --> 02:15:45,770
It's not so bad.

2032
02:15:57,220 --> 02:15:57,700
Okay.

2033
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:01,060
Nice.

2034
02:16:01,620 --> 02:16:02,660
Three tumbleweeds.

2035
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:04,840
A thing's going on.

2036
02:16:05,060 --> 02:16:05,360
Oh no.

2037
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:05,700
Oh no.

2038
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:07,000
Also, I don't.

2039
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:07,940
Look at him go.

2040
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:08,520
Look at him go.

2041
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:10,540
Oh my god!

2042
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:12,920
Oh my god!

2043
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:14,640
Uh-oh, uh-oh, okay.

2044
02:16:15,260 --> 02:16:16,920
I don't know how to block attacks.

2045
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:20,600
So...

2046
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:22,240
Oh, oh god.

2047
02:16:24,240 --> 02:16:25,700
Okay, that's one hit.

2048
02:16:30,540 --> 02:16:30,920
Nice.

2049
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:33,260
Uh, 250, oh.

2050
02:16:33,740 --> 02:16:34,260
What does that mean?

2051
02:16:53,100 --> 02:16:54,740
I'm so tense right now.

2052
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:57,900
Truly the dark souls of slot machines.

2053
02:17:08,640 --> 02:17:09,160
Good?

2054
02:17:10,100 --> 02:17:10,540
Come

2055
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:19,960
on, Ocelot.

2056
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:20,700
Come on, Ocelot.

2057
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:23,820
Ghosts are proud creatures.

2058
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:28,460
Oh, no.

2059
02:17:28,640 --> 02:17:30,540
We didn't even attack him once.

2060
02:17:31,100 --> 02:17:32,580
This game is so cruel.

2061
02:17:33,740 --> 02:17:35,460
What's the strategy here?

2062
02:17:37,880 --> 02:17:40,320
I wish I could just pay more money.

2063
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:43,100
Like, I don't know why it...

2064
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:44,040
Why it...

2065
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:54,940
I don't know why you can't like continue the fight you know
why it has to take you back to the very beginning is the

2066
02:17:54,940 --> 02:18:06,180
most painful part but I got to show you the scenes and we
got to a boss fight so I feel very fulfilled in what I was

2067
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:11,820
able to show you guys today even though it took two hours to
get there

2068
02:18:31,900 --> 02:18:39,920
I don't think there's a way to avoid the attacks.

2069
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:41,640
Please,

2070
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:48,240
please, please!

2071
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:53,100
Guys, I think we're in trouble.

2072
02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:56,380
I think we're in trouble.

2073
02:19:00,980 --> 02:19:01,860
Nice?

2074
02:19:02,180 --> 02:19:02,580
Ooh!

2075
02:19:03,500 --> 02:19:03,780
Yes!

2076
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:05,900
That did some big damage.

2077
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:08,300
Big damage.

2078
02:19:09,140 --> 02:19:12,700
Spin to win.

2079
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:18,340

Good damage to win.

2091
02:20:18,630 --> 02:20:19,750
Snake dies.

2092
02:20:21,070 --> 02:20:22,070
Because I'm already dead.

2093
02:20:22,490 --> 02:20:24,550
Your money has no power here.

Sayonara.

2099
02:20:40,510 --> 02:20:46,430
You can see a snake's face in slow-mo.

2100
02:20:47,170 --> 02:20:47,610
Can't remember.

2101
02:20:48,170 --> 02:20:49,490
I don't know.

2102
02:20:49,530 --> 02:20:49,830
Ah.

2103
02:20:53,170 --> 02:20:55,890
Real footage of Minch Phantom gameplay.

2104
02:20:56,970 --> 02:20:58,630
Metal Gear Solid gameplay.

2105
02:21:02,270 --> 02:21:03,110
Haha.

Thanks, Os, a lot.

2107
02:21:07,170 --> 02:21:08,310

2113
02:21:19,470 --> 02:21:20,330
Wait, what do you mean save?

2114
02:21:21,250 --> 02:21:25,650
Oh, and also we're, we have our little, the little, um,
thing on.

2115
02:21:29,270 --> 02:21:31,210
Wait, I was gonna stop it.

2116
02:21:31,370 --> 02:21:37,270
I was gonna stop playing because I feel like we got, but I'm
kind of curious.

2117
02:21:37,450 --> 02:21:38,190
What do you mean save?

2118
02:21:46,110 --> 02:21:48,870
Okay, one last fork for the road, everybody.

2119
02:21:49,730 --> 02:21:51,290
One last fork for the road.

2120
02:21:52,050 --> 02:21:52,090
Ready?

2121
02:21:54,490 --> 02:21:55,930
Say it with me.

2122
02:21:57,750 --> 02:21:58,990
Get full!

2123
02:22:00,270 --> 02:22:00,890

Get...

2125
02:22:13,070 --> 02:22:13,690
Rationed!

2126
02:22:13,690 --> 02:22:13,970
Rationed!

2127
02:22:16,810 --> 02:22:23,990
4 big bonus why are we still here just to suffer every night
i can feel my fork in my cigar even my bullets the progress

2128
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:36,430
i've lost the hours i've lost won't stop nanda codifying big
bonus what a thrill awesome why are we still here oh we got

2129
02:22:36,430 --> 02:22:42,590
it okay everybody's in with me oh sorry i instinctively
pushed it very quickly

2130
02:22:46,690 --> 02:22:47,610
I'm sorry.

2131
02:22:49,350 --> 02:22:52,470
Gosh, Ocelad's just hand-holding the whole time.

2132
02:22:52,630 --> 02:22:54,910
He won't let me press how I want to.

2133
02:22:55,510 --> 02:23:02,270
He's like, come on, right, right, right, right, right,
right.

2134
02:23:02,290 --> 02:23:02,970
Oh, Eva!

2135
02:23:05,310 --> 02:23:06,490
Oh, never mind.

2136
02:23:06,670 --> 02:23:07,550
Eva does not respond.

2137
02:23:10,770 --> 02:23:11,230
Yeah!

2138
02:23:11,230 --> 02:23:11,470
Yeah!

2139
02:23:24,260 --> 02:23:28,720
It's time to get forked!

2140
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:29,420
Yeah!

2141
02:23:32,820 --> 02:23:42,420
And with that, everybody, I think, uh, I think that is all
of the Metal Gear Patchy slot.

2142
02:23:43,660 --> 02:23:48,140
I'm gonna keep chatting after this because I don't want to
end just quite yet.

2143
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:51,200
But, um, what do you guys think?

2144
02:23:52,280 --> 02:24:00,840
What did you guys think?

2145
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:05,440
I have no idea what's happening, but my brain liked the
sounds and colors.

2146
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:06,160
Cool machining.

2147
02:24:06,580 --> 02:24:07,000
Thanks.

2148
02:24:08,040 --> 02:24:09,260
An interesting concept.

2149
02:24:09,780 --> 02:24:18,940
I think having a battle through slots is actually something
only...

2150
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:20,840
the devil could conjure up.

2151
02:24:21,740 --> 02:24:23,300
I think it is so evil.

2152
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:29,820
but other than that, I do like watching Ocelot spin his
guts.

2153
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:35,620
I understood nothing.

2154
02:24:36,220 --> 02:24:36,720
You know what?

2155
02:24:37,380 --> 02:24:44,080
Yeah, you could watch this and be like, this is the most...

2156
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:44,620
Oh my god.

2157
02:24:47,340 --> 02:24:48,940
This is a true...

2158
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:51,080
Truly...

2159
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:52,680
This is Metal Gear Solid 3.

2160
02:24:52,980 --> 02:24:54,840
I don't understand anything that's going on.

2161
02:24:55,340 --> 02:24:57,540
Will you ever do another Apache Slot stream?

2162
02:24:58,140 --> 02:25:00,240
Well, I think...

2163
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:05,600
I think it's...

2164
02:25:07,580 --> 02:25:08,460
What's the word?

2165
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:13,500
I'm gonna be... I think it's gonna be just exactly the same
as here.

2166
02:25:14,220 --> 02:25:17,920
We may be... I mean, there are still some like events that
we haven't gotten before.

2167
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:23,120
will be mostly like the same exact thing.

2168
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:26,880
Yeah, I'll have to check the difficulty later.

2169
02:25:27,500 --> 02:25:27,780
For sure.

2170
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:37,580
About every two to three streams ended with a few games of
Patchy Slot.

2171
02:25:38,380 --> 02:25:43,240
See, that would be difficult because I had to move my Patchy
Slot.

2172
02:25:43,580 --> 02:25:46,680
My Patchy Slot is usually over there in my room.

2173
02:25:47,100 --> 02:25:58,100
And I had to very painstakingly drag it closer to my
computer so that wouldn't really work out because yeah oh I

2174
02:25:58,100 --> 02:26:12,920
can disable the echo mic you're right thank you there we go
so how large is it it's very large and very in charge it's

2175
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:26,260
very heavy yeah it's uh okay so let's see this is my arm and
it this is the top of the machine and it doesn't even go to

2176
02:26:26,260 --> 02:26:41,760
like the middle and it's it's uh hold on let me measure how
thick it is thick uh maybe hold on it's like this this thick

2177
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:47,800
wait it's like

2178
02:26:50,900 --> 02:26:53,580
You can't show these guns on YouTube.

2179
02:26:58,180 --> 02:27:00,420
It is kind of like a refrigerator.

2180
02:27:00,660 --> 02:27:02,960
Yeah, it does kind of feel like a refrigerator.

2181
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:05,400
This is cool, though.

2182
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:07,020
I don't think I've ever seen this before.

2183
02:27:08,200 --> 02:27:09,940
Or if I have, it was a long time ago.

2184
02:27:10,760 --> 02:27:12,200
So, yay.

2185
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:19,560
Is your patchy slot running?

2186
02:27:20,900 --> 02:27:22,940
You better, nanda korewa.

2187
02:27:25,140 --> 02:27:25,280
It.

2188
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:33,900
So, I would say your arm is thin, like squiggly noodles.

2189
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:37,780
What do you mean by that?

2190
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:44,740
What do you mean by that?

2191
02:27:45,940 --> 02:27:47,040
Not the Joker.

2192
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:51,880
One last dance for those post-game Joker, nanda korewa.

2193
02:27:54,860 --> 02:28:02,320
trying to figure out what we all just watched since this is
probably the most folks have seen of the patchy game.

2194
02:28:02,680 --> 02:28:03,320
You think so?

2195
02:28:05,820 --> 02:28:06,760
I don't know.

2196
02:28:07,540 --> 02:28:17,480
I wish I could have shown it off better, but my luck tends
to be poor, so I truly apologize, but it is quite fine.

2197
02:28:17,820 --> 02:28:21,580
It's not something that I could typically sit.

2198
02:28:21,740 --> 02:28:22,660
Well, that's not true.

2199
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:33,880
I think I could typically sit and do it for oh sorry for
like an hour or something hour two if I really wanted to but

2200
02:28:33,880 --> 02:28:46,540
it's like so it's it's maybe not the most super duper
exciting thing right here I'm gonna actually do this

2201
02:28:55,110 --> 02:29:06,150
no I want to go back to well maybe it'll go maybe it will um
I don't know what to call it.

2202
02:29:06,490 --> 02:29:08,490
Wait, there's continue zone right here.

2203
02:29:11,570 --> 02:29:12,950
I don't know what that is.

2204
02:29:17,490 --> 02:29:18,890
I do not know.

2205
02:29:20,790 --> 02:29:21,210
Anyway.

2206
02:29:24,810 --> 02:29:26,970
Sorry if I'm making weird faces.

2207
02:29:28,850 --> 02:29:29,270
Sorry.

2208
02:29:32,050 --> 02:29:32,770
Okay.

2209
02:29:33,670 --> 02:29:35,070
Did you read the manual?

2210
02:29:35,270 --> 02:29:36,570
It didn't come with a manual!

2211
02:29:40,550 --> 02:29:41,930
It didn't come with a manual.

2212
02:29:42,170 --> 02:29:43,010
Okay, give me one second.

2213
02:29:43,190 --> 02:29:46,210
I'm gonna set up my real quick.

2214
02:29:48,330 --> 02:29:49,290
Hold on.

2215
02:30:07,980 --> 02:30:08,940
I'm fine.

2216
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:10,240
Don't worry about me.

2217
02:30:12,400 --> 02:30:16,140
leave it on in the background if if we were

2218
02:30:24,810 --> 02:30:41,370
okay oh what the hell why am i asleep oh hold on oh what's i
get i think i did break something i think i broke my brain

2219
02:30:44,130 --> 02:31:09,460
wait i think i'm i think i'm oh no wait wait hold on Uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh, uh, why, woo, huh, uh, uh, uh, okay, okay.

2220
02:31:11,770 --> 02:31:13,370
I don't know how to work my body.

2221
02:31:15,230 --> 02:31:17,250
I don't know how to work my body, you guys.

2222
02:31:21,070 --> 02:31:23,190
Maybe I should, can you guys hear the machine still?

2223
02:31:23,350 --> 02:31:24,690
I'm gonna put on some music.

2224
02:31:25,290 --> 02:31:25,950
Let's see.

2225
02:31:26,070 --> 02:31:31,690
A little.

2226
02:31:31,870 --> 02:31:33,950
You can hear the birds chirping just a tiny bit.

2227
02:31:59,190 --> 02:31:59,590
Key.

2228
02:32:01,490 --> 02:32:01,890
Do.

2229
02:32:03,650 --> 02:32:04,050
Key.

2230
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:16,640
Very springtime.

2231
02:32:17,280 --> 02:32:19,380
I use this BGM all the time.

2232
02:32:20,140 --> 02:32:22,040
You're a simp.

2233
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:25,540
Thanks for showing off your pouchy slot machine and for all
the work it took to set this up.

2234
02:32:25,740 --> 02:32:26,940
Stream has been really special.

2235
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:30,400
Special is a word for it, isn't it?

2236
02:32:32,740 --> 02:32:34,520
That is a word for it, right?

2237
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:39,460
Maybe you're supposed to ignore the 1, 2, 3 and risk it for
the biscuit.

2238
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:40,080
I don't know.

2239
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:40,780
Why would they tell you?

2240
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:49,220
to one two three then oh snake you good that always seemed
to get you blues or yellows which I think are the lowest

2241
02:32:49,220 --> 02:33:06,340
value spins maybe I don't know what's the fork count at
truly unforkable measures is this your craziest metal gear

2242
02:33:06,340 --> 02:33:13,080
item probably the other thing I kind of wanted to show it
off in the background but but I couldn't fix it in a good

2243
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:16,820
way was my, I have a snake standy, like a life size.

2244
02:33:16,900 --> 02:33:27,560
Well, maybe not life size, but I have like a big snake
standy from when they sold, what was it?

2245
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:31,340
I think it was MGS, I can't remember actually.

2246
02:33:31,580 --> 02:33:37,420
It was one of the advertisements in Europe though.

2247
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:40,540
I think, I'm pretty sure it was MGS too.

2248
02:33:44,960 --> 02:34:03,640
but like what's the what's the oh my gosh my brain is is I
have a lack of ectoplasm happening is the standing bigger

2249
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:05,370
than you no no no no

2250
02:34:10,660 --> 02:34:15,420
I can say that was the best VTuber playing a patchy slot
stream I've ever seen.

2251
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:17,820
You must watch those a lot, truly.

2252
02:34:21,700 --> 02:34:23,160
You must watch those all the time.

2253
02:34:23,380 --> 02:34:24,420
It's a big market.

2254
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:30,440
Everybody out here is saying, VTubers playing patchy slots.

2255
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:34,840
It's the new, the new meta.

2256
02:34:39,940 --> 02:34:42,860
There was some, oh, I'm gonna zoom in a little bit more.

2257
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:55,360
some uh i did want to like um what's the word uh i wanted to
talk some more about like my hashtags and stuff like that i

2258
02:34:55,360 --> 02:35:02,160
know it's kind of probably not the right stream to do that
but um even i was i was like at first i was like i don't

2259
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:16,920
need an art tag whatever but then um i think i need an art
tag i feel really sad leaving my old tags and stuff and then

2260
02:35:16,920 --> 02:35:24,380
i also kind of want to talk about like um fan names sorry
it's like the most random time to talk about this isn't it

2261
02:35:24,380 --> 02:35:29,140
but um oh and if you haven't seen

2262
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:44,600
oh where is it my schedule for well tomorrow tomorrow i'm
playing zoom beanies

2263
02:35:51,920 --> 02:36:04,740
Oh gosh, my voice is, my throat is still healing, so I can't
do high notes right now, but, um, uh, yeah, but, um, on, uh,

2264
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:12,780
Tuesday I'm playing the new Chilazar game, because I'm a
VTuber, you guys, and I have to play it, I have to, I'm so

2265
02:36:12,780 --> 02:36:20,080
sorry, but also, I kind of like those, like, games where
it's, like, find the, anomaly I think those are kind of fun

2266
02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:32,740
it's mandatory I can't say that I'm truly been resummoned
until I play it you know and then Monday is the podcast

2267
02:36:32,740 --> 02:36:40,820
release day so instead of a stream you can listen to the
podcast probably pretty much every Monday I'll have off just

2268
02:36:40,820 --> 02:36:51,080
because that's when we'll be releasing the podcast so um yes
yes yes uh wednesday is when we record the podcast so i'll

2269
02:36:51,080 --> 02:37:05,620
have that day too and uh thursday is facade which is a game
that i've i saw a video on it recently and i was like oh my

2270
02:37:05,620 --> 02:37:13,260
gosh i forgot this existed um there's like this other old
flash game i think on new grounds called I think it was like

2271
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:15,140
The Negotiator or something.

2272
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:19,320
And it always...

2273
02:37:19,320 --> 02:37:20,660
I don't know if it's the same person.

2274
02:37:21,620 --> 02:37:22,480
It's a classic.

2275
02:37:22,660 --> 02:37:23,540
It is, yeah.

2276
02:37:25,600 --> 02:37:27,580
So, The Negotiator.

2277
02:37:27,660 --> 02:37:29,140
Yeah, you guys remember it?

2278
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:29,820
Oh my god.

2279
02:37:30,060 --> 02:37:31,660
I reference it all the time.

2280
02:37:31,960 --> 02:37:33,520
And I don't think people realize...

2281
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:34,140
Anytime...

2282
02:37:34,140 --> 02:37:36,120
Well, like...

2283
02:37:36,120 --> 02:37:39,020
I'll be like, I'm gonna blow this place to hell.

2284
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:42,600
That's what I'm referencing.

2285
02:37:50,220 --> 02:37:59,760

Metal Gear Twin Snakes, let's go.

2302
02:39:36,380 --> 02:39:39,740
I remember spoiled myself by accident one time with this
game.

2303
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:41,660
I can't wait.

2304
02:39:41,780 --> 02:39:43,380
I can't wait to play Twin Snakes.

2305
02:39:44,140 --> 02:39:46,660
And then probably Sunday, I'll do a gorilla stream.

2306
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:54,940
Honestly, I just didn't know what to stream that day, so I
said gorilla stream if I come up with something.

2307
02:39:55,640 --> 02:39:57,380
Maybe it's Tetrio, but I'll be honest, you guys.

2308
02:39:57,560 --> 02:39:59,720
I haven't gotten better at all at Tetris.

2309
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:01,720
I haven't...

2310
02:40:01,720 --> 02:40:02,780
Thank you for all the donuts.

2311
02:40:02,940 --> 02:40:03,400
Thank you, guys.

2312
02:40:03,920 --> 02:40:06,120
I haven't gotten better at all at Tetris.

2313
02:40:06,900 --> 02:40:07,340
I...

2314
02:40:11,800 --> 02:40:14,860
I'm going to get my butt white whooped.

2315
02:40:25,700 --> 02:40:26,980
You're awesome.

2316
02:40:26,980 --> 02:40:26,980
You're

2317
02:40:37,880 --> 02:40:57,120
awesome.

2318
02:41:00,760 --> 02:41:00,840
Thank you.

2319
02:41:02,360 --> 02:41:03,140
Oh gosh.

2320
02:41:04,100 --> 02:41:07,800
Glad to have finally gotten the definitive MGS3 experience.

2321
02:41:08,340 --> 02:41:08,860
Thanks, Mint.

2322
02:41:09,320 --> 02:41:11,260
This stream was definitely more fun than you seem to think.

2323
02:41:11,400 --> 02:41:13,420
I'm glad that you say that, Sam.

2324
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:14,460
Thank you.

2325
02:41:20,680 --> 02:41:21,640
Oh, gosh.

2326
02:41:27,100 --> 02:41:28,060
Oh, gosh.

2327
02:41:28,780 --> 02:41:29,520
Oh, gosh.

2328
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:37,280
Sorry, girl, but there's at least one minute.

2329
02:41:37,300 --> 02:41:37,900
Mint Tomo?

2330
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:38,960
Mint Tomo!

2331
02:41:39,080 --> 02:41:39,900
What is that?

2332
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:43,180
That won't wipe your Inno's top.

2333
02:41:43,840 --> 02:41:44,760
Thanks for all the donuts!

2334
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:45,740
Thank you guys!

2335
02:41:46,500 --> 02:41:48,440
I'm vacuuming your butt for that comment.

2336
02:41:48,540 --> 02:41:48,920
No!

2337
02:41:49,360 --> 02:41:50,460
Don't do it, Jimmy!

2338
02:41:53,360 --> 02:41:56,940
To the heroes of Tetris for the privilege to wipe your butt
and body.

2339
02:42:01,950 --> 02:42:03,790
I don't want you to stop this.

2340
02:42:07,090 --> 02:42:07,630
No!

2341
02:42:12,030 --> 02:42:13,150
Oh man!

2342
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:22,000
Why?

2343
02:42:23,620 --> 02:42:26,900
Why is my brain like this?

2344
02:42:28,940 --> 02:42:29,600
Thank you!

2345
02:42:30,380 --> 02:42:31,680
Mint brain, don't say wiped.

2346
02:42:31,840 --> 02:42:33,200
Don't say wiped, absolutely.

2347
02:42:33,480 --> 02:42:34,500
Do not say wiped.

2348
02:42:34,840 --> 02:42:36,300
Mint mouth, wiped.

2349
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:41,760
Oh, stinky.

2350
02:42:42,820 --> 02:42:43,100
Choo!

2351
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:47,020
Cool piece of Metal Gear franchise you showed off today.

2352
02:42:47,140 --> 02:42:47,640
Thanks for the stream.

2353
02:42:47,740 --> 02:42:48,500
I'm the new being haunted.

2354
02:42:49,280 --> 02:42:49,860
Yay!

2355
02:42:50,760 --> 02:42:56,540
Yeah, all it requires is giving me a little bit of your life
force.

2356
02:42:57,020 --> 02:42:57,360
Is that okay?

2357
02:42:57,700 --> 02:42:58,280
Batayfun.

2358
02:43:04,780 --> 02:43:12,570
I can't believe I got this invested over watching someone
play slots.

2359
02:43:12,750 --> 02:43:15,050
It got a little intense sometimes, for real.

2360
02:43:16,030 --> 02:43:20,050
It got pretty intense in some sections.

2361
02:43:20,050 --> 02:43:24,810
I was feeling the pressure, the actual pressure.

2362
02:43:26,570 --> 02:43:28,770
Unrelated, but I really love your Ace Combat games
collection.

2363
02:43:29,350 --> 02:43:31,750
Thank you non-John Ace Combat.

2364
02:43:33,070 --> 02:43:37,010
I'm so jealous that you have even older Ace Combat, though.

2365
02:43:37,130 --> 02:43:39,150
I only have PS2 era, sadly.

2366
02:43:39,650 --> 02:43:43,230
I've gone to so many used game stores.

2367
02:43:43,990 --> 02:43:49,970
Unfortunately, so many of the ones that I have are in those
like GameStop-esque boxes.

2368
02:43:50,050 --> 02:44:00,910
but um you know i i only played seven and when i did i was
like oh my gosh i think i i think i love this and i i

2369
02:44:00,910 --> 02:44:11,530
struggled a little bit with like following the story so it
almost felt hold on i can't say wait it felt like if i were

2370
02:44:11,530 --> 02:44:16,490
to have played metal gear rising before the rest to the
Metal Gear series.

2371
02:44:16,630 --> 02:44:17,190
You know what I mean?

2372
02:44:17,690 --> 02:44:29,230
So it's like, I really wanted to know more about the, the,
the rest of, uh, the lore.

2373
02:44:30,830 --> 02:44:31,770
that's nuts.

2374
02:44:31,930 --> 02:44:32,470
I know, right?

2375
02:44:32,530 --> 02:44:33,350
Who would do that?

2376
02:44:34,250 --> 02:44:34,830
Go ahead.

2377
02:44:36,350 --> 02:44:38,730
Play the games in release order, idiot.

2378
02:44:42,470 --> 02:44:44,670
So yeah, I've just been kind of collecting them.

2379
02:44:45,190 --> 02:44:48,650
um i haven't played a lot i've played any of them yet so

2380
02:44:52,650 --> 02:45:04,330
excited excited jpeg dog lore yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah seven
is a new story but knowing the well i think it was like i i

2381
02:45:04,330 --> 02:45:12,650
know it all takes place uh what's it called um it takes
place like you know more about like the belkin war and stuff

2382
02:45:12,650 --> 02:45:25,670
like that um like there's obviously there's uh like there's
a lot of lore that didn't feel um like you know uh what was

2383
02:45:25,670 --> 02:45:32,590
it stonehenge and everything like that strange reel yes yes
it all takes place in strange reel yeah yeah yeah it's it's

2384
02:45:32,590 --> 02:45:51,630
from three right that it takes place in strange reel or four
wait i can't remember three or four right it's four wait

2385
02:45:51,630 --> 02:46:03,630
from two i thought one and two were like kind of mostly
separate is that not the case am i misunderstood don't worry

2386
02:46:03,630 --> 02:46:09,630
i still have my membu card if you open memberships back i'll
be joining back thank you

2387
02:46:13,090 --> 02:46:13,610
well.

2388
02:46:17,580 --> 02:46:20,760
Yo, I really enjoyed the stream today.

2389
02:46:21,360 --> 02:46:22,840
Thank you, Mike Tyson's butt.

2390
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:27,120
I hope your butt gets thoroughly wiped in a good way.

2391
02:46:28,040 --> 02:46:29,080
In a good way, right?

2392
02:46:39,460 --> 02:46:46,600
It likes weird games where the stories doesn't make much
sense without context and that focuses on machines is this

2393
02:46:46,600 --> 02:46:58,020
time to pitch armored core i'm scared to play armored core
because it's like dark souls robots and dark souls scares me

2394
02:46:58,020 --> 02:47:07,500
but typically i don't like to back down from a challenge so
hmm hmm hmm hmm

2395
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:23,880
thank you for the stream for sharing the machine i've not
seen such an extensive look at it before and man what could

2396
02:47:23,880 --> 02:47:32,080
have been with the fox engine remake i know when you get the
theater mode sometimes like i said before when um before it

2397
02:47:32,080 --> 02:47:39,640
started playing with the bonus or whatever like sometimes it
will let you choose theater mode or there's there is another

2398
02:47:39,640 --> 02:47:51,440
mode i think the other mode takes you directly into the like
the quote-unquote story part of the game so I think it

2399
02:47:51,440 --> 02:48:06,220
starts you on the helicopter but with this we got both so I
guess it worked out honestly but Yeah, seeing the cutscenes,

2400
02:48:06,260 --> 02:48:07,280
just...

2401
02:48:08,340 --> 02:48:09,240
Oh, hello.

2402
02:48:09,760 --> 02:48:10,440
Monkey!

2403
02:48:12,960 --> 02:48:13,780
Oh,

2404
02:48:17,320 --> 02:48:19,280
ape escape, yeah, we gotta do ape escape.

2405
02:48:19,660 --> 02:48:20,600
Miso gear.

2406
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:22,540
Yeah!

2407
02:48:25,180 --> 02:48:27,280
Yeah, mint is adorable.

2408
02:48:28,040 --> 02:48:28,820
Stop it.

2409
02:48:29,280 --> 02:48:30,400
Stop it.

2410
02:48:31,220 --> 02:48:32,260
Stop it.

2411
02:48:33,260 --> 02:48:44,760
stop come on guys stop it come on come on i mean i mean it's
like i'm amazed like i have to be cute right but like come

2412
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:47,980
on oh

2413
02:48:52,520 --> 02:49:08,340
okay let's talk let's talk fan names in this very okay sorry
i should have done this last stream i just My brain, I'm too

2414
02:49:08,340 --> 02:49:09,740
silly, okay.

2415
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:16,680
And hashtags.

2416
02:49:25,180 --> 02:49:28,260
And I hope that, uh...

2417
02:49:28,260 --> 02:49:39,000
I know that probably if we're, like, older fans, um, I don't
necessarily want to get rid of the name fandom, right?

2418
02:49:43,280 --> 02:49:52,820
I don't want to like throw away everything that we came up
with before but I do think that having something a little

2419
02:49:52,820 --> 02:50:02,920
bit more concrete because you can't say I am a fandom you
have to it's more like I'm part of the fandom you know what

2420
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:15,560
I mean I think boot ties boot ties like bow tie but a boo
tie fandom is good

2421
02:50:19,900 --> 02:50:27,260
boomers boo champs I don't know I haven't really thought of
it at all because I kind of just came in thinking that I

2422
02:50:27,260 --> 02:50:31,740
would have everything the same as before so I'm just like

2423
02:50:39,320 --> 02:50:41,740
I think Boomer's...

2424
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:44,920
Chocominto art?

2425
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:46,120
Wait, that's so cute, actually.

2426
02:50:47,060 --> 02:50:48,040
I think...

2427
02:50:48,040 --> 02:50:51,820
I think Boomer's feels a little too...

2428
02:50:51,820 --> 02:50:55,640
Like, any ghost vtuber could have that, right?

2429
02:50:55,760 --> 02:50:57,300
As their fan name.

2430
02:50:58,600 --> 02:51:00,820
I think we gotta come up with something a little more
specific.

2431
02:51:01,740 --> 02:51:03,520
There was wisps before.

2432
02:51:04,300 --> 02:51:06,120
Like it was Fandom and then...

2433
02:51:06,120 --> 02:51:08,540
If you were in the Fandom, you were a wisp.

2434
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:11,800
But, um...

2435
02:51:14,020 --> 02:51:14,820
Hmm...

2436
02:51:14,820 --> 02:51:15,720
Phantoms?

2437
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:18,220
Phantoms in the Fandom?

2438
02:51:19,420 --> 02:51:20,480
Like this?

2439
02:51:24,080 --> 02:51:24,880
Phantoms?

2440
02:51:25,560 --> 02:51:26,920
Insane in the membrane?

2441
02:51:27,220 --> 02:51:28,440
Phantoms in the Fandom?

2442
02:51:28,620 --> 02:51:29,120
Phantom?

2443
02:51:29,360 --> 02:51:29,400
Phantoms?

2444
02:51:31,740 --> 02:51:32,560
Mint Busters?

2445
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:33,900
That's kind of cute, actually.

2446
02:51:34,080 --> 02:51:34,660
Wait, mint.

2447
02:51:35,540 --> 02:51:35,940
Mint?

2448
02:51:36,180 --> 02:51:37,500
Oh, mint Busters.

2449
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:41,760
Uh.

2450
02:51:44,080 --> 02:51:44,600
Fantomies?

2451
02:51:45,020 --> 02:51:45,800
It's kind of cute, too.

2452
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:51,540
It's pretty cute, too.

2453
02:51:57,170 --> 02:51:57,410
Hmm.

2454
02:52:02,220 --> 02:52:04,640
I'm seeing if I see any others that I really like.

2455
02:52:16,290 --> 02:52:17,150
Thank you for this.

2456
02:52:17,170 --> 02:52:17,930
Oh no.

2457
02:52:20,630 --> 02:52:21,110
Mentos.

2458
02:52:23,770 --> 02:52:24,210
Oh my god.

2459
02:52:24,590 --> 02:52:27,310
This page seems to have some instructions in a forum for the
Metal Gear Pack.

2460
02:52:27,550 --> 02:52:27,930
What?

2461
02:52:28,790 --> 02:52:29,210
Really?

2462
02:52:34,140 --> 02:52:39,560
Since our time was cut short, what are the chances of a
return to trials and tribulations to play the Maid Cafe?

2463
02:52:41,880 --> 02:52:43,760
Wait, that's a DLC, isn't it?

2464
02:52:45,100 --> 02:52:47,080
Um, we'll see.

2465
02:52:47,740 --> 02:52:48,140
We'll see.

2466
02:52:48,140 --> 02:52:50,660
I can't just play the DLC episode.

2467
02:52:50,860 --> 02:52:53,140
I have to play everything all over again.

2468
02:53:06,170 --> 02:53:07,130
Dead cell.

2469
02:53:10,250 --> 02:53:11,870
Oh, dead cell.

2470
02:53:11,970 --> 02:53:13,850
That doesn't even make any sense.

2471
02:53:15,950 --> 02:53:17,290
Like it, I...

2472
02:53:18,690 --> 02:53:20,930
I kind of love it, but...

2473
02:53:20,930 --> 02:53:23,330
I know I want everything to be a Metal Gear reference, you
guys.

2474
02:53:25,250 --> 02:53:27,710
Yeah, but not everything can be a Metal Gear reference.

2475
02:53:30,070 --> 02:53:30,710
Boots?

2476
02:53:31,490 --> 02:53:34,470
I don't get it.

2477
02:53:36,710 --> 02:53:38,150
Oh, like, dudes?

2478
02:53:41,870 --> 02:53:43,850
I'm not feeling it.

2479
02:53:44,050 --> 02:53:44,470
Sorry.

2480
02:53:51,060 --> 02:53:52,920
I highly recommend keeping everything the same.

2481
02:53:55,220 --> 02:53:58,440
with the mods as wasps and us as membus.

2482
02:53:58,560 --> 02:54:00,960
Well, membus is the membership though.

2483
02:54:05,080 --> 02:54:09,680
In the leech room, while watching Mint attempt the boss in
Sonic for the 11th time.

2484
02:54:09,860 --> 02:54:10,660
Okay, shut up, Pune.

2485
02:54:16,100 --> 02:54:27,300
See, and part of me wants to keep things the same as before
two, but like, We have to be honest, things aren't the same,

2486
02:54:27,400 --> 02:54:28,040
you know?

2487
02:54:28,240 --> 02:54:30,480
Things are a little different than they were before.

2488
02:54:32,500 --> 02:54:33,600
Can we just keep whips?

2489
02:54:34,780 --> 02:54:37,220
But you don't want anything, you don't want something
more...

2490
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:38,440
specific?

2491
02:54:45,900 --> 02:54:46,260
To...

2492
02:54:50,090 --> 02:54:50,450
To...

2493
02:54:50,450 --> 02:54:50,750
Me?

2494
02:54:51,790 --> 02:54:53,410
I'm so, I'm so egotistical.

2495
02:54:53,790 --> 02:54:56,110
It has to be related to me, you guys, I'm just kidding.

2496
02:54:59,270 --> 02:55:00,310
Mint Tomo?

2497
02:55:02,510 --> 02:55:04,610
Boo-Boo-Rigade.

2498
02:55:06,910 --> 02:55:07,970
Oh, like, Brigade.

2499
02:55:09,670 --> 02:55:11,130
But Boo-Rigade.

2500
02:55:13,470 --> 02:55:14,610
This is all...

2501
02:55:14,610 --> 02:55:18,490
I think, no matter what I choose, I can't make everybody
happy.

2502
02:55:18,630 --> 02:55:20,690
So I think I just gotta choose what I like the most.

2503
02:55:23,670 --> 02:55:24,190
Because...

2504
02:55:24,190 --> 02:55:25,610
It'll still be.

2505
02:55:26,490 --> 02:55:27,810
Like, if it's...

2506
02:55:27,810 --> 02:55:28,610
You know, it's...

2507
02:55:28,630 --> 02:55:29,430
Hmm.

2508
02:55:31,070 --> 02:55:31,770
Hmm.

2509
02:55:32,250 --> 02:55:33,970
You are awesome.

2510
02:55:35,610 --> 02:55:36,130
Hmm.

2511
02:55:38,930 --> 02:55:39,630
Min...

2512
02:55:40,190 --> 02:55:40,950
Min...

2513
02:55:41,410 --> 02:55:43,950
Min-T-Mintos...

2514
02:55:43,950 --> 02:55:46,130
Min-Mintus...

2515
02:55:47,090 --> 02:55:48,510
S-Sotans.

2516
02:55:49,390 --> 02:55:49,650
Oh!

2517
02:55:50,330 --> 02:55:52,050
Min-Tis-Sotans!

2518
02:55:53,810 --> 02:55:55,610
Like a Minnesotan?

2519
02:55:57,110 --> 02:55:58,610
Like a Minnesotan?

2520
02:55:59,450 --> 02:56:04,390
like the state in the United States of America Minnesota

2521
02:56:08,790 --> 02:56:11,330
that's wild why

2522
02:56:14,630 --> 02:56:25,070
that's actually crazy uh oh I think my chat froze are you
guys still there oh okay it froze on YouTube YouTube has

2523
02:56:25,070 --> 02:56:33,490
been freezing so much for me recently I don't know if you
said this before but our weekend stream always early the

2524
02:56:33,490 --> 02:56:43,250
upcoming weekday streams are a bit too late to catch for me
unfortunately ah ah I didn't say before weekend streams I

2525
02:56:43,250 --> 02:56:54,770
typically do a little bit earlier but also in the weekday
I'll try and do some midday stuff as well so there will be a

2526
02:56:54,770 --> 02:57:04,410
mix of stuff and my schedule is never truly consistent
unfortunately i'm sorry i'm all over the place but uh but

2527
02:57:04,410 --> 02:57:17,530
there will be times that will be good for um eu watchers if
there are any as well so yeah sorry that i don't have a i

2528
02:57:17,530 --> 02:57:28,350
don't think i've ever had really a set time where i'm just
like okay guys every day 7 p.m est catch me here no i'm

2529
02:57:28,370 --> 02:57:29,690
Sometimes, I don't know why.

2530
02:57:30,370 --> 02:57:32,150
Sometimes I'll be like, today's 7.

2531
02:57:33,170 --> 02:57:34,650
But tomorrow is 6.

2532
02:57:35,370 --> 02:57:36,270
I don't know why.

2533
02:57:37,110 --> 02:57:43,190
It's maybe just because I try to do a little bit of variety
for people who are just like, oh, I can't make the 7 p.m.

2534
02:57:43,210 --> 02:57:43,550
times.

2535
02:57:43,670 --> 02:57:45,170
I can only do the 6 p.m.

2536
02:57:45,170 --> 02:57:45,610
times.

2537
02:57:46,250 --> 02:57:48,110
So, yeah.

2538
02:57:50,750 --> 02:57:52,370
I'm fine with whatever you choose.

2539
02:57:52,570 --> 02:57:54,130
Can I get some of that dripping chocolate?

2540
02:58:00,180 --> 02:58:01,460
I feel uncomfortable.

2541
02:58:05,820 --> 02:58:09,540
Hold on, I'm going to try and reset my

2542
02:58:12,920 --> 02:58:15,080
YouTube.

2543
02:58:30,240 --> 02:58:32,180
There we go.

2544
02:58:32,300 --> 02:58:33,040
Thank you.

2545
02:58:33,340 --> 02:58:34,740
You mentioned let's go.

2546
02:58:37,820 --> 02:58:38,460
Okay.

2547
02:58:41,180 --> 02:58:42,360
The fan cheese?

2548
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:44,000
Wait, that's so cute, actually.

2549
02:58:51,170 --> 02:58:57,530
I'm kind of leaning towards phantomies.

2550
02:59:05,090 --> 02:59:05,730
Ugh.

2551
02:59:10,010 --> 02:59:12,330
Because it sounds close enough to fandom.

2552
02:59:21,860 --> 02:59:22,700
Phantomo?

2553
02:59:23,200 --> 02:59:23,700
No.

2554
02:59:27,960 --> 02:59:31,160
I think Phantomis maybe.

2555
02:59:44,020 --> 02:59:49,140
Because it's like Phantomis in the...

2556
02:59:50,120 --> 03:00:02,300
See for me when I say like, hey I'm a wisp, it doesn't feel
to me so much like a like like it just feels like a

2557
03:00:02,300 --> 03:00:20,280
description like you guys are wisps but like you're you're a
phantomy wisp i think right like it's more like i'm i'm my

2558
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:28,520
wisp type is phantomy and memberships are the

2559
03:00:36,260 --> 03:00:53,300
So I think we'll go with phantomies if you guys are okay
with it.

2560
03:00:56,240 --> 03:00:59,980
Phantomies in the fandom.

2561
03:01:05,680 --> 03:01:09,680
For those who still like fandom, of course you can still use
it.

2562
03:01:09,960 --> 03:01:10,880
Of course, of course.

2563
03:01:15,880 --> 03:01:17,780
Okay, it's been decided.

2564
03:01:18,400 --> 03:01:19,880
I lay down the hammer.

2565
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:25,380
Okay.

2566
03:01:26,740 --> 03:01:27,800
I feel so...

2567
03:01:27,800 --> 03:01:29,040
I feel so...

2568
03:01:29,040 --> 03:01:30,280
I don't know.

2569
03:01:30,780 --> 03:01:31,940
I don't know how to feel.

2570
03:01:32,160 --> 03:01:33,320
Like, I feel so...

2571
03:01:33,320 --> 03:01:34,060
What's the word?

2572
03:01:37,120 --> 03:01:37,640
Maybe...

2573
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:46,800
not like it's like almost guilt you know it almost feels
like like a guilt but don't think that you know because

2574
03:01:46,800 --> 03:01:53,540
we're making a few little changes you know there sometimes
this happens to other vtubers as well where they have to

2575
03:01:53,540 --> 03:02:08,040
change their fan names for whatever reason so um will they
be redesigned what the wisp design no no it's Still the

2576
03:02:08,040 --> 03:02:08,720
same.

2577
03:02:18,990 --> 03:02:20,190
I don't mind.

2578
03:02:20,430 --> 03:02:21,590
Okay, thank you, Splagoon.

2579
03:02:27,490 --> 03:02:33,170
I don't know, I just got so many questions from people being
like, what's, what, what do I call myself?

2580
03:02:33,350 --> 03:02:41,290
And like, I think, you know, like I said back then, we came
up with stuff, but it was kind of like multiple things.

2581
03:02:41,370 --> 03:02:45,710
I think we need to settle on some more definitive stuff.

2582
03:02:45,830 --> 03:02:46,450
You know what I mean?

2583
03:02:49,190 --> 03:02:50,250
Something a little, like, I don't know.

2584
03:02:50,370 --> 03:02:53,670
Wisps is still fine, but...

2585
03:02:53,670 --> 03:02:54,270
I don't know.

2586
03:02:55,250 --> 03:02:56,890
Am I overthinking this?

2587
03:02:57,910 --> 03:02:59,550
Am I overthinking this?

2588
03:02:59,970 --> 03:03:01,430
Maybe I'm overthinking this.

2589
03:03:01,530 --> 03:03:02,210
I don't know.

2590
03:03:02,390 --> 03:03:03,030
I don't know.

2591
03:03:03,830 --> 03:03:04,570
Am I...

2592
03:03:04,570 --> 03:03:05,410
Yes?

2593
03:03:11,630 --> 03:03:13,330
Should we just give it as...

2594
03:03:13,910 --> 03:03:15,350
Should we just...

2595
03:03:17,430 --> 03:03:19,670
Then should we just keep it as a whips?

2596
03:03:21,730 --> 03:03:23,370
Whip, whips, whips.

2597
03:03:24,450 --> 03:03:25,410
What do I do?

2598
03:03:34,770 --> 03:03:35,230
Pull?

2599
03:03:35,430 --> 03:03:35,970
Okay, pull.

2600
03:03:36,990 --> 03:03:38,790
I don't want this responsibility.

2601
03:03:42,250 --> 03:03:43,070
Fan name.

2602
03:03:45,590 --> 03:03:45,670
Whips.

2603
03:03:53,590 --> 03:03:55,610
I don't want this responsibility.

2604
03:03:56,890 --> 03:03:57,590
You decide.

2605
03:04:20,320 --> 03:04:23,640
If you don't like the poll result, then you know what answer
you really want.

2606
03:04:23,920 --> 03:04:24,320
That's true.

2607
03:04:24,560 --> 03:04:25,980
That's true.

2608
03:04:35,810 --> 03:04:36,850
You're us.

2609
03:04:38,350 --> 03:04:40,690
I just don't want people mad at me.

2610
03:04:44,470 --> 03:04:49,430
I just don't want people being like, oh no, she's changed
too much.

2611
03:04:50,030 --> 03:04:51,070
I don't know.

2612
03:04:51,370 --> 03:04:52,710
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

2613
03:04:57,070 --> 03:04:58,190
Can't please everyone.

2614
03:04:58,550 --> 03:04:59,310
Yeah, I know.

2615
03:05:01,950 --> 03:05:04,830
I know, I know, I know, I know.

2616
03:05:11,400 --> 03:05:14,420
And I know this is probably not even like that big of a
deal.

2617
03:05:15,340 --> 03:05:16,340
It's just a fandom.

2618
03:05:24,830 --> 03:05:32,990
It was because I get so confused when it's like You have the
wisps, you have the fandom, you have the members, you have

2619
03:05:32,990 --> 03:05:42,330
this, you have that And I'm like, I can't keep up either I
can't keep up either Ugh

2620
03:05:51,470 --> 03:05:51,950
Okay.

2621
03:05:52,790 --> 03:05:55,550
Well, Fantomies seems to have the consensus.

2622
03:05:56,710 --> 03:05:57,410
Not by much.

2623
03:05:57,910 --> 03:05:58,630
I will give it that.

2624
03:05:58,870 --> 03:05:59,610
Not by much.

2625
03:06:00,810 --> 03:06:02,590
And not everybody watching.

2626
03:06:02,790 --> 03:06:02,890
Oh.

2627
03:06:04,250 --> 03:06:05,550
There's more votes coming in.

2628
03:06:06,110 --> 03:06:08,130
I was gonna say not everybody watching is voting.

2629
03:06:08,770 --> 03:06:09,490
Hey guys.

2630
03:06:09,650 --> 03:06:10,210
I'm just kidding.

2631
03:06:10,450 --> 03:06:11,070
You don't have to vote.

2632
03:06:11,210 --> 03:06:11,490
It's okay.

2633
03:06:12,890 --> 03:06:13,010
Oh.

2634
03:06:13,450 --> 03:06:13,870
Oh.

2635
03:06:14,030 --> 03:06:15,230
More votes coming in.

2636
03:06:15,230 --> 03:06:15,770
Thank you.

2637
03:06:16,770 --> 03:06:17,890
I'll just keep it up.

2638
03:06:18,370 --> 03:06:19,550
Well, we'll keep this up.

2639
03:06:19,550 --> 03:06:21,690
And then we can decide hashtags.

2640
03:06:23,410 --> 03:06:27,070
Flip the W and rearrange the letters.

2641
03:06:27,670 --> 03:06:28,930
And you have what we really are.

2642
03:06:29,170 --> 03:06:29,550
Simps.

2643
03:06:29,770 --> 03:06:30,070
Stop.

2644
03:06:31,370 --> 03:06:31,790
No!

2645
03:06:34,310 --> 03:06:35,150
No!

2646
03:06:37,310 --> 03:06:38,150
Okay.

2647
03:06:44,410 --> 03:06:46,770
You're a simp.

2648
03:06:48,350 --> 03:06:48,770
Okay.

2649
03:06:52,500 --> 03:07:04,760
um um okay hashtag so I need an art tag what was that I like
the chocolate mint art that was cute I have to make sure no

2650
03:07:04,760 --> 03:07:13,360
one's using stuff though um I guess we can keep my current
one as like it's still a general tag that's even written as

2651
03:07:13,360 --> 03:07:22,980
that so I can still keep it as that too um toothpaste
toothpaste Why?

2652
03:07:29,160 --> 03:07:30,620
No, we're not.

2653
03:07:30,960 --> 03:07:33,020
Why you guys have to say...

2654
03:07:33,960 --> 03:07:34,840
Fant...

2655
03:07:34,840 --> 03:07:35,920
Mmm.

2656
03:07:39,500 --> 03:07:41,120
Mint paste.

2657
03:07:43,840 --> 03:07:45,740
Simps rise up.

2658
03:07:49,670 --> 03:07:52,130
The will of the wisps is phantomies.

2659
03:07:55,450 --> 03:08:10,790
stop saying fart stop stop it stop saying fart stop it stop
ghost can't even fart you guys this is not even accurate

2660
03:08:11,570 --> 03:08:13,750
stop saying

2661
03:08:17,570 --> 03:08:23,170
stop saying fart please not with that attitude

2662
03:08:26,310 --> 03:08:27,470
Ghosts are all far?

2663
03:08:27,630 --> 03:08:28,790
What are you talking about?

2664
03:08:29,830 --> 03:08:30,950
What is ectoplasm?

2665
03:08:31,110 --> 03:08:32,430
It's like a little more gooey.

2666
03:08:40,850 --> 03:08:41,650
Ghost post?

2667
03:08:41,830 --> 03:08:42,610
Oh my gosh, wait.

2668
03:08:43,630 --> 03:08:44,430
Hashtag ghost.

2669
03:08:44,610 --> 03:08:46,010
But it doesn't have to do with art.

2670
03:08:46,190 --> 03:08:47,130
I think that's the hardest thing.

2671
03:08:47,650 --> 03:08:48,690
It's probably also taken.

2672
03:08:49,630 --> 03:08:50,290
Snake's just been...

2673
03:08:50,290 --> 03:08:51,530
I think Snake is lost.

2674
03:08:51,790 --> 03:08:53,110
I can't find his way through.

2675
03:08:53,170 --> 03:08:54,710
the forest at all

2676
03:09:10,280 --> 03:09:24,380
fan art oh that's kind of cute like that wait that's
actually so cute wait that's wait it's probably taken let's

2677
03:09:24,380 --> 03:09:34,240
check let's check let's check There's like some yaoi parry.

2678
03:09:36,820 --> 03:09:38,400
I don't think I can use this.

2679
03:09:40,220 --> 03:09:42,240
There's like some yaoi parry.

2680
03:09:43,640 --> 03:09:45,620
Oh my god, these get a little graphic.

2681
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:52,580
It's just some guys.

2682
03:09:56,620 --> 03:09:58,100
I don't think I can take...

2683
03:09:58,100 --> 03:09:59,280
I don't think I can use it.

2684
03:10:07,380 --> 03:10:09,540
I know what we'll fix it

2685
03:10:15,360 --> 03:10:27,420
I wonder if this is actually We just do fan fart It works
Wait I have to see if this is taken Yes Yes Yes

2686
03:10:41,600 --> 03:10:42,000
Phantography?

2687
03:10:42,240 --> 03:10:43,480
Wait, that's so cute too.

2688
03:10:44,840 --> 03:10:46,560
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

2689
03:10:50,220 --> 03:10:53,140
I feel like this is probably taken, but we can check.

2690
03:10:54,760 --> 03:10:56,100
It's hard being a ghost.

2691
03:10:58,900 --> 03:11:07,960
Because there's uh so many other ghosts oh this one doesn't
seem to be used very much

2692
03:11:15,400 --> 03:11:20,150
maybe oh with a with an f like that

2693
03:11:24,380 --> 03:11:27,380
mintography you guys are going crazy

2694
03:11:30,400 --> 03:11:35,140
phantom paint this one's a little punny right it's kind of
fun

2695
03:11:38,620 --> 03:11:46,960
yeah this one wait latest this one doesn't seem to be used
at all well a little bit but you know it's hard to find a

2696
03:11:46,960 --> 03:11:56,540
hashtag that's not used at all and you know what this kind
of fits in with the theme of the general hashtag since it's

2697
03:11:58,600 --> 03:12:09,540
which is spirit photography that's what it means in Japanese
mint sightings wait that's so cute too I like that for like

2698
03:12:09,540 --> 03:12:19,740
if you ever like well I don't well if you get like the merch
and you like take a picture of me somewhere but I guess that

2699
03:12:19,740 --> 03:12:26,560
works with the Shinday Shashin too you can probably use the
other hashtag for it.

2700
03:12:34,420 --> 03:12:35,340
NSFW tag!

2701
03:12:40,430 --> 03:12:42,270
I like fan-tography though, I think that's good.

2702
03:12:42,550 --> 03:12:43,510
I think we can go with that.

2703
03:12:44,430 --> 03:12:46,270
I think we'll go with the fan-tography.

2704
03:12:49,590 --> 03:12:50,510
Do I...

2705
03:12:50,510 --> 03:12:53,210
Do I have to...

2706
03:12:58,800 --> 03:12:59,660
Do I have to...

2707
03:12:59,660 --> 03:13:01,200
Why are you so fast with that?

2708
03:13:21,260 --> 03:13:23,760
Maybe it's necessary.

2709
03:13:24,580 --> 03:13:25,360
I don't know.

2710
03:13:28,900 --> 03:13:32,980
So that certain things don't show up in the fan-tography.

2711
03:13:35,960 --> 03:13:37,340
Only fans!

2712
03:13:37,660 --> 03:13:38,500
Oh my god.

2713
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:39,580
Like this?

2714
03:13:42,720 --> 03:13:43,820
Like that?

2715
03:13:50,400 --> 03:13:52,960
I feel like that has to be taken, though, right?

2716
03:13:55,460 --> 03:13:55,840
Yan!

2717
03:13:58,220 --> 03:13:59,740
Please know R18.

2718
03:14:00,280 --> 03:14:01,400
Is this $100 enough?

2719
03:14:01,620 --> 03:14:04,940
At least maybe any R18 is untagged.

2720
03:14:08,880 --> 03:14:10,840
The fact that you donated!

2721
03:14:11,480 --> 03:14:12,680
Akadono for that!

2722
03:14:13,300 --> 03:14:15,160
Also, OnlyFans is definitely taken.

2723
03:14:15,440 --> 03:14:16,200
Do not...

2724
03:14:16,220 --> 03:14:17,580
I don't want to look at it.

2725
03:14:22,320 --> 03:14:28,920
I'm just afraid that if people draw stuff, that they'll put
it in the art tag and then it'll show up mainstream.

2726
03:14:31,040 --> 03:14:32,320
Not safe for mint.

2727
03:14:39,370 --> 03:14:39,890
No!

2728
03:14:45,370 --> 03:14:47,570
I don't think having a tag necessarily...

2729
03:14:47,590 --> 03:14:49,170
necessarily encourages it.

2730
03:14:49,410 --> 03:14:54,590
It's just so that it, if it does show up, it's in its own
place.

2731
03:14:56,710 --> 03:14:57,690
I think.

2732
03:15:01,760 --> 03:15:04,880
I don't, I, I don't know.

2733
03:15:05,940 --> 03:15:06,860
Maybe we don't need it.

2734
03:15:06,980 --> 03:15:07,480
I don't know.

2735
03:15:09,780 --> 03:15:13,580
Not everyone has one, so it's not so necessary.

2736
03:15:14,480 --> 03:15:15,000
I don't know.

2737
03:15:20,560 --> 03:15:21,080
Oh.

2738
03:15:24,240 --> 03:15:27,740
Oh, I think you're in the rain!

2739
03:15:35,880 --> 03:15:37,400
I'll think about this one.

2740
03:15:37,660 --> 03:15:38,820
I will think about this one.

2741
03:15:39,460 --> 03:15:40,240
I'll think about this one.

2742
03:15:41,860 --> 03:15:43,240
I feel weird about it.

2743
03:15:43,740 --> 03:15:44,300
I don't know.

2744
03:15:44,420 --> 03:15:44,640
I don't know.

2745
03:15:45,400 --> 03:15:47,080
I don't know.

2746
03:15:48,160 --> 03:15:50,200
Especially with people just coming in.

2747
03:15:53,940 --> 03:15:59,400
Especially with people just cupping it up like Let's just
get this off the screen real quick

2748
03:16:06,170 --> 03:16:14,510
I think I have the live tag Minto Live And I have the
general tag And I have the art tag I think that's good

2749
03:16:14,510 --> 03:16:22,090
enough I think that's good enough Anything other Like if
it's not art You can put it in the general tag And I think

2750
03:16:22,090 --> 03:16:31,270
it'll be okay Hmm cosplay tag I don't think I need one I
really don't think I need one I think you could put cosplay

2751
03:16:31,270 --> 03:16:39,070
in the general tag because I'll still check it when you have
so many hashtags it's hard to check all of them so yeah

2752
03:16:41,090 --> 03:16:48,830
memes and general tag yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah just put it
all in the general tag unless it's art because for art like

2753
03:16:48,830 --> 03:17:03,490
I like to you know obviously I go through it for for um like
thumbnails and stuff like that so so we'll have art live is

2754
03:17:06,150 --> 03:17:15,170
minto minto live as it has been always

2755
03:17:20,570 --> 03:17:27,610
Boston makes me feel good I think think that is probably
already used so much.

2756
03:17:29,810 --> 03:17:31,410
I do like not save for mint though.

2757
03:17:31,530 --> 03:17:32,790
I think that's really funny.

2758
03:17:36,650 --> 03:17:40,610
My keyboard no do JP copy and paste.

2759
03:17:42,690 --> 03:17:43,550
Copy and paste.

2760
03:17:48,510 --> 03:17:52,610
I think probably you could do it in if you wanted to, but...

2761
03:17:56,310 --> 03:17:58,970
mintolive I wonder.

2762
03:18:02,800 --> 03:18:04,420
The last thing...

2763
03:18:05,020 --> 03:18:05,580
Oh, sorry.

2764
03:18:07,060 --> 03:18:10,680
I was like, you guys, I think I'm stupid.

2765
03:18:14,820 --> 03:18:16,520
Oh, it's mint olive!

2766
03:18:18,580 --> 03:18:27,700
I searched hashtag mintolive, and it I clicked latest and it
was a soap and it said mint and rosemary and I was like mint

2767
03:18:27,700 --> 03:18:43,980
that's me even though I searched even though even though I
searched mint myself first time here and love the MGS3

2768
03:18:43,980 --> 03:18:49,340
gotcha experience thank you thanks for being here

2769
03:18:52,420 --> 03:18:53,180
Oh, man.

2770
03:18:53,420 --> 03:18:57,340
But also, it's mint and rosemary extra virgin olive oil
soap.

2771
03:18:57,880 --> 03:19:01,080
I was like, mint olive is the hashtag.

2772
03:19:01,200 --> 03:19:02,740
Hashtag mint olive.

2773
03:19:04,900 --> 03:19:05,980
That's so funny.

2774
03:19:07,820 --> 03:19:08,640
Mint olive.

2775
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:10,620
But yeah, okay.

2776
03:19:10,860 --> 03:19:12,040
Those can be the hashtags.

2777
03:19:13,580 --> 03:19:14,980
Um, and then.

2778
03:19:16,640 --> 03:19:16,980
Uh.

2779
03:19:17,980 --> 03:19:18,440
Yes.

2780
03:19:22,340 --> 03:19:23,860
Fantomies is still winning, but it's.

2781
03:19:23,880 --> 03:19:26,080
it went down a little

2782
03:19:29,140 --> 03:19:37,460
I still don't know what to do maybe I'll sleep on it I'll
sleep on it and I'll make a tweet about it so that we can we

2783
03:19:37,460 --> 03:19:47,820
can maybe I'll ask Google I'll say I'll give it you know
I'll spin a wheel but I'll make a tweet about all this being

2784
03:19:47,820 --> 03:20:01,710
like here's hashtags it's just these three and here's a fan
name and yeah yeah we'll see

2785
03:20:05,280 --> 03:20:15,760
ask Matara for her opinion as well yeah maybe I will because
uh she I tend to ask her for like her opinion on things a

2786
03:20:15,760 --> 03:20:28,080
lot too anything else you wanted to discuss with us no you
are dismissed class is dismissed no no I just wanted to hang

2787
03:20:28,080 --> 03:20:38,700
out too you know I feel like since I've gotten back I mean
last stream maybe I didn't talk so much it was like me

2788
03:20:38,700 --> 03:20:44,480
answering things and then singing so it was less talking
with Tara Miller

2789
03:20:48,060 --> 03:21:06,340
that's perfect because that means um that means she will die
maybe by my hands after I finish sucking her soul you know

2790
03:21:15,390 --> 03:21:27,350
soul sucker yummy yummy are you big boss venom or Ocelot?

2791
03:21:34,440 --> 03:21:34,920
Ah.

2792
03:21:36,360 --> 03:21:42,100
Well, it was never explicitly said that Ocelot...

2793
03:21:42,100 --> 03:21:42,820
Was it?

2794
03:21:43,040 --> 03:21:44,000
Actually, I can't remember.

2795
03:21:44,560 --> 03:21:46,580
No, I don't think it was explicitly said.

2796
03:21:49,300 --> 03:21:49,780
Right?

2797
03:21:50,180 --> 03:21:55,120
It was explicitly said that Ocelot killed Master Miller?

2798
03:21:56,360 --> 03:21:57,120
Kazuhairo Miller?

2799
03:21:58,880 --> 03:22:01,020
What are we supposed to call your cat these days?

2800
03:22:01,100 --> 03:22:06,140
How do you know I have a Oh my gosh, I'm going to try and
give my cat a friend this month.

2801
03:22:07,620 --> 03:22:08,620
It was never explicit.

2802
03:22:09,120 --> 03:22:09,900
It was explicit.

2803
03:22:10,580 --> 03:22:11,400
It was implied.

2804
03:22:11,660 --> 03:22:18,040
Yeah, I think it was implied, but it was never like, Hi, my
name is Asala and I'm going to go to that house and I'm

2805
03:22:18,040 --> 03:22:19,680
going to murder him in the dark.

2806
03:22:20,280 --> 03:22:29,600
No, it was a little bit like, yeah, we'll see each other
again.

2807
03:22:32,720 --> 03:22:34,860
Um, oh, my cat.

2808
03:22:37,580 --> 03:22:40,460
That guy is stinky.

2809
03:22:41,520 --> 03:22:43,160
Oh, my gosh.

2810
03:22:45,100 --> 03:22:45,900
He...

2811
03:22:45,900 --> 03:22:46,780
Uh, let's see.

2812
03:22:47,680 --> 03:22:48,000
Hmm.

2813
03:22:54,700 --> 03:22:54,940
Hmm.

2814
03:22:55,360 --> 03:22:56,040
Stinky.

2815
03:22:56,840 --> 03:22:59,280
He's very stinky, my cat.

2816
03:22:59,640 --> 03:23:01,160
He's kind of the worst.

2817
03:23:02,940 --> 03:23:03,480
Huff, huff.

2818
03:23:04,220 --> 03:23:05,220
Don't have him.

2819
03:23:05,560 --> 03:23:06,220
He's dark.

2820
03:23:06,240 --> 03:23:10,700
He went outside and he rolled in the dirt today.

2821
03:23:12,260 --> 03:23:13,420
And all the pollen.

2822
03:23:15,320 --> 03:23:17,040
But, oh my gosh, it was kind of crazy.

2823
03:23:17,860 --> 03:23:24,840
Because I had gotten my cat shaved a long time ago now.

2824
03:23:25,400 --> 03:23:30,920
I got him shaved because his hair was getting really long
and matted and stuff like that.

2825
03:23:31,080 --> 03:23:33,880
So it was like forming knots on his chest.

2826
03:23:34,040 --> 03:23:34,860
He couldn't reach it.

2827
03:23:36,240 --> 03:23:50,500
and stuff and so i shaved him and after i shaved him he was
he was like super scraggly for the longest time like his

2828
03:23:50,500 --> 03:24:02,460
hair just was not growing back he uh he had like some
patches grow back but like overall his hair was just like he

2829
03:24:02,460 --> 03:24:07,780
looked like a old grandpa Did he look like a sphinx cat?

2830
03:24:07,900 --> 03:24:09,420
No, because he still had hair growing.

2831
03:24:09,620 --> 03:24:10,940
It just was not a lot.

2832
03:24:11,180 --> 03:24:13,760
It was, like, really ugly and terrible.

2833
03:24:15,920 --> 03:24:18,120
It was, like, it would, like, stick up.

2834
03:24:18,220 --> 03:24:19,260
It was just so bad.

2835
03:24:19,720 --> 03:24:25,120
But when I came back from Japan, he had so much of his hair
grew back.

2836
03:24:25,460 --> 03:24:31,740
I was, like, all it took was me leaving for him to become a
regular cat again.

2837
03:24:31,800 --> 03:24:33,420
And he's, like, really soft now.

2838
03:24:33,580 --> 03:24:34,680
And I'm like, ah.

2839
03:24:36,240 --> 03:24:39,260
I can finally pet you again without feeling disgusting.

2840
03:24:39,680 --> 03:24:40,720
I was stressing him out.

2841
03:24:41,120 --> 03:24:43,080
Probably because every day I'm just like, Grow!

2842
03:24:44,140 --> 03:24:44,140
Grow!

2843
03:24:44,760 --> 03:24:45,040
Grow!

2844
03:24:45,900 --> 03:24:49,520
And he's like, don't put pressure on me.

2845
03:24:50,360 --> 03:24:51,580
Why are you so mean?

2846
03:24:52,160 --> 03:24:54,240
I say it lovingly, okay?

2847
03:24:54,760 --> 03:24:56,200
I say it lovingly.

2848
03:25:03,740 --> 03:25:06,080
He was stressed he would shave him again.

2849
03:25:06,240 --> 03:25:10,180
It might have actually like really freaked him out.

2850
03:25:10,440 --> 03:25:17,440
But I mean, having the knots gone was really important
because that hurts.

2851
03:25:17,560 --> 03:25:18,620
That hurts him.

2852
03:25:19,040 --> 03:25:20,400
So, yeah.

2853
03:25:22,120 --> 03:25:23,680
Hair tonic with the nip.

2854
03:25:27,580 --> 03:25:28,340
Hi, Minto.

2855
03:25:28,940 --> 03:25:29,860
Thank you for the fun stream.

2856
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:34,460
Fun fact, cat nip is in the plant family as mint.

2857
03:25:35,020 --> 03:25:35,420
Really?

2858
03:25:37,840 --> 03:25:40,810
Is that why you guys are so addicted to me?

2859
03:25:45,220 --> 03:25:45,760
Obsessed.

2860
03:25:46,960 --> 03:25:47,970
You guys are obsessed with me.

2861
03:25:52,360 --> 03:25:56,620
The awkward in-between phase applies in for other species.

2862
03:25:58,220 --> 03:26:01,360
Yeah, I felt like he was going through a strange puberty.

2863
03:26:02,600 --> 03:26:03,840
But he's all good now.

2864
03:26:05,320 --> 03:26:05,820
Yeah, yeah.

2865
03:26:06,860 --> 03:26:08,740
Yeah, yeah, he's all good now.

2866
03:26:09,920 --> 03:26:14,960
It's not, his hair's not as fluffy as before, but that's
fine, because if it were, then it would be getting nodded

2867
03:26:14,960 --> 03:26:15,340
again.

2868
03:26:15,780 --> 03:26:18,800
So, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2869
03:26:21,480 --> 03:26:24,620
Maybe we need to add cat ears to the wisp design.

2870
03:26:27,520 --> 03:26:29,240
Maybe we need to, um...

2871
03:26:31,860 --> 03:26:32,340
Yeah.

2872
03:26:32,580 --> 03:26:34,580
You're a simp.

2873
03:26:35,500 --> 03:26:36,140
I hope to see you out.

2874
03:26:36,240 --> 03:26:39,640
I would love to show you my Ace Combat merch with you
though.

2875
03:26:39,720 --> 03:26:40,800
Oh my gosh, yes!

2876
03:26:42,100 --> 03:26:42,420
Wait.

2877
03:26:43,560 --> 03:26:44,280
Do you have a lot?

2878
03:26:44,900 --> 03:26:46,320
It might be a lot to bring, right?

2879
03:26:47,040 --> 03:26:47,400
Okay.

2880
03:26:49,320 --> 03:26:49,680
My...

2881
03:26:51,300 --> 03:26:52,760
Do you have a friend in mind?

2882
03:26:52,980 --> 03:26:53,340
No.

2883
03:26:53,880 --> 03:26:54,620
I do not.

2884
03:26:55,460 --> 03:26:57,860
But basically, like yesterday, I decided it.

2885
03:26:57,940 --> 03:26:59,980
I was like, okay, this month is going to be the month.

2886
03:27:00,460 --> 03:27:02,080
I have to get him a friend this month.

2887
03:27:02,820 --> 03:27:03,520
I don't know why.

2888
03:27:04,600 --> 03:27:05,740
I don't know why.

2889
03:27:06,240 --> 03:27:16,020
like it's I've been trying to get him a friend for a really
long time so I

2890
03:27:21,610 --> 03:27:40,160
think I'm gonna stick with wisps I think I just decided
because I've already said wisps several times now are you

2891
03:27:40,160 --> 03:27:44,600
still thinking about this sorry I'm an overthinker.

2892
03:27:45,440 --> 03:27:45,660
Okay.

2893
03:27:46,320 --> 03:27:46,880
Get out of here.

2894
03:27:47,080 --> 03:27:49,300
I like Fantomies too, but...

2895
03:27:50,900 --> 03:27:51,640
I have an idea.

2896
03:27:52,660 --> 03:27:53,280
I have an idea.

2897
03:27:55,220 --> 03:27:58,300
Actually, I don't know if I'll have my old settings for...

2898
03:28:01,400 --> 03:28:01,840
memberships.

2899
03:28:04,060 --> 03:28:05,380
Greatest anime betrayal.

2900
03:28:11,820 --> 03:28:13,280
Yeah, I think Wisps...

2901
03:28:14,420 --> 03:28:17,180
I can be like, you guys are my little wisps.

2902
03:28:19,580 --> 03:28:21,540
It's simple enough that it's fine.

2903
03:28:22,140 --> 03:28:23,960
Even though it's like just a regular word.

2904
03:28:24,140 --> 03:28:24,520
But that's okay.

2905
03:28:25,700 --> 03:28:26,160
It's okay.

2906
03:28:26,320 --> 03:28:26,580
It's okay.

2907
03:28:27,740 --> 03:28:28,320
Do both?

2908
03:28:28,440 --> 03:28:29,180
No, no, no.

2909
03:28:29,300 --> 03:28:31,640
I think that's why I was so conflicted to begin with.

2910
03:28:31,860 --> 03:28:33,340
Because I already had multiple stuff.

2911
03:28:34,560 --> 03:28:35,520
It's like calling cats.

2912
03:28:35,920 --> 03:28:38,520
Whisp-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s.

2913
03:28:38,520 --> 03:28:39,360
Whisp-s-s-s-s-s.

2914
03:28:41,420 --> 03:28:43,200
Oh my gosh, it's perfect.

2915
03:28:43,300 --> 03:28:45,140
And we can put cat ears on you guys for real!

2916
03:28:49,940 --> 03:28:50,520
Oh my god.

2917
03:28:51,520 --> 03:28:52,420
It's perfect!

2918
03:28:53,740 --> 03:28:55,040
Now I feel so much better.

2919
03:29:01,340 --> 03:29:02,960
Wisps, zps, zps, zps, zps.

2920
03:29:04,440 --> 03:29:05,940
My cat's looking here now.

2921
03:29:06,160 --> 03:29:07,880
Zp, zp, zp, zp, zp, zp, zp, zp, zp.

2922
03:29:10,820 --> 03:29:11,320
No.

2923
03:29:12,200 --> 03:29:12,460
No.

2924
03:29:15,720 --> 03:29:16,940
Yeah, it's perfect.

2925
03:29:17,960 --> 03:29:18,520
So cute.

2926
03:29:28,440 --> 03:29:31,160
For your YouTube kittens.

2927
03:29:32,260 --> 03:29:34,000
Come here, my little YouTube kitten.

2928
03:29:34,760 --> 03:29:35,600
What is that noise?

2929
03:29:36,420 --> 03:29:36,600
What?

2930
03:29:40,200 --> 03:29:41,320
Oh my god.

2931
03:29:41,900 --> 03:29:43,960
Not safe for work, Takami.

2932
03:29:44,520 --> 03:29:45,840
NSF Wisps.

2933
03:29:47,340 --> 03:29:48,900
Wait, that's kind of funny too.

2934
03:29:51,900 --> 03:29:55,940
I'll think about it We'll think about it I'll think about it
I'll think about it

2935
03:30:04,780 --> 03:30:05,780
Hold on

2936
03:30:09,660 --> 03:30:12,140
I just realized I had a message

2937
03:30:27,500 --> 03:30:31,300
Do you know what you're going to make your member icons Or
do you already have one?

2938
03:30:31,480 --> 03:30:39,060
I already have stuff I'm hoping that YouTube will has saved
my old stuff.

2939
03:30:39,200 --> 03:30:40,760
I think I still have it though.

2940
03:30:42,660 --> 03:30:43,840
From before.

2941
03:30:45,220 --> 03:30:47,460
But I'm hoping that they saved it.

2942
03:30:47,680 --> 03:30:52,240
So that like when I turn monetization back on.

2943
03:30:52,380 --> 03:30:53,940
It's all like the same.

2944
03:30:55,640 --> 03:30:58,700
Otherwise it's going to be a little annoying I think.

2945
03:30:59,740 --> 03:31:01,120
I don't trust YouTube.

2946
03:31:01,800 --> 03:31:02,280
You know what?

2947
03:31:02,680 --> 03:31:04,040
I don't know if I do either.

2948
03:31:05,400 --> 03:31:19,000
be wiped if that's the case uh wait like where even is my
okay wait emotes okay i have my emotes i don't know where my

2949

3066
03:39:37,370 --> 03:39:37,730
Ever.

3067
03:39:38,490 --> 03:39:39,810

3073
03:39:52,530 --> 03:39:54,410
This is so long ago.

3074
03:39:54,910 --> 03:39:55,750
Oh my gosh.

3075
03:39:57,570 --> 03:39:58,030
So...

3076
03:39:59,290 --> 03:40:00,330
Yes, of course.

3077
03:40:00,830 --> 03:40:03,150
Okay, so the left is what I drew.

3078
03:40:03,770 --> 03:40:05,570
What kind of outfit I was thinking.

3079
03:40:07,890 --> 03:40:14,910
For those who don't know, Maya actually helped come up with
the way I look now for my second outfit.

3080
03:40:15,670 --> 03:40:18,930
So she actually came up with it.

3081
03:40:20,650 --> 03:40:22,190
So this right here.

3082
03:40:23,130 --> 03:40:25,490
This little guy there is you.

3083
03:40:26,650 --> 03:40:27,790
That one right there.

3084
03:40:28,070 --> 03:40:30,210
That one on my right.

3085
03:40:32,030 --> 03:40:32,510
Yeah.

3086
03:40:33,310 --> 03:40:33,750
So.

3087
03:40:35,050 --> 03:40:37,870
I'm so grateful to Maya because...

3088
03:40:37,890 --> 03:40:46,190
She gave me like so many, like I sent her my ugly, stupid
poopy drawing and she made it look so perfect and cute.

3089
03:40:46,790 --> 03:40:47,850

03:40:48,490 --> 03:40:49,550

03:40:49,690 --> 03:40:51,490
Yeah, we'll add cat ears too.

3092
03:40:51,690 --> 03:40:53,490
So you can be whipspspspspsps.

3093
03:40:55,230 --> 03:40:55,530
Yeah.

3094
03:40:57,190 --> 03:41:00,630
She made everything look so perfect and cute.

3095
03:41:01,150 --> 03:41:05,110
There were so many designs that here I...

3096
03:41:05,110 --> 03:41:06,330
Is it okay if I show...

3097
03:41:06,330 --> 03:41:07,870
I don't know if I ever showed these books.

3101
03:41:38,650 --> 03:41:42,810
these hair styles and dress styles.

3102
03:41:43,730 --> 03:41:49,730
And I think I ultimately settled on 10, as you can tell.

3103
03:41:50,590 --> 03:41:52,370
But there's so many.

3104
03:41:53,510 --> 03:41:55,330
I also really like 6.

3105
03:41:56,210 --> 03:41:57,650
I think it's so cute.

3106
03:41:58,430 --> 03:42:00,490
So, yeah.

3107
03:42:01,670 --> 03:42:04,930
So, so many.

3108
03:42:06,170 --> 03:42:09,950
But definitely, Three, three is really cute.

3109
03:42:10,210 --> 03:42:12,070
Five is really, wait, I think five and...

3110
03:42:12,070 --> 03:42:14,510
Oh no, five and six are just a little different.

3111
03:42:15,330 --> 03:42:16,150
Those are longer.

3112
03:42:16,910 --> 03:42:19,030
But I ended up really loving the wavy hair.

3113
03:42:19,810 --> 03:42:21,050
So, yeah.

3114
03:42:22,270 --> 03:42:23,610
Six had the old hairstyle.

3115
03:42:25,210 --> 03:42:26,390
Uh, a little.

3116
03:42:26,830 --> 03:42:32,130
It's just, uh, it's, yeah, it's my old hairstyle, but with
the twin tails on the sides.

3117
03:42:33,050 --> 03:42:33,390
Mm-mm.

3118
03:42:35,410 --> 03:42:37,870
And, uh, it's kind of similar to this one.

3119
03:42:37,890 --> 03:42:43,310
And then I drew two with like the little hair sticking out.

3120
03:42:45,130 --> 03:42:49,110
And yeah, one day I'll grow my hair out eventually.

3121
03:42:52,050 --> 03:42:54,890
The wavy hair was so last minute, so I'm glad you liked it
the most.

3122
03:42:56,950 --> 03:42:57,910
Thank you.

3123
03:42:59,310 --> 03:43:01,650

the ectoplasm exactly exactly so maybe one day we'll see we

3129
03:44:03,860 --> 03:44:14,140
us Momo already offered ourselves once we could do it again
I know when when Matara said that she was getting Momos to

3130
03:44:14,140 --> 03:44:25,260
sacrifice themselves to summon me I was like wow I'm
feasting my friend Rifticus is I remember Rifticus is

3131
03:44:25,260 --> 03:44:42,040

3134
03:45:13,260 --> 03:45:18,240
But yeah, it still feels very weird to be here.

3135
03:45:19,460 --> 03:45:21,420
It feels very strange.

3136
03:45:22,120 --> 03:45:22,640
But that's okay.

3137
03:45:23,700 --> 03:45:25,560
I'll get used to it, I'm sure.

3138
03:45:27,340 --> 03:45:31,800
And hopefully, hopefully you guys stick around.

3139
03:45:32,280 --> 03:45:35,400
We can all hang out still and, you know, have a good time.

3140
03:45:37,300 --> 03:45:47,760
and hopefully you guys enjoy the podcast and I simp oh wait,

thank you for all the donos I can honestly already imagine

3142
03:45:55,400 --> 03:46:00,820
the fan art you floating in a moonlit night in the middle of
a forest with my cat ears wait, I don't have the cat ears,

3143
03:46:00,900 --> 03:46:06,120
you have the cat ears surrounded by dozens of different
colored glowing whiskers with your own cat ears whiskers Oh,

3144
03:46:07,000 --> 03:46:08,060
with our own cat ears.

3145
03:46:08,600 --> 03:46:09,360
Maybe even tails.

3146
03:46:10,300 --> 03:46:11,640
Like slime rancher.

3147
03:46:15,320 --> 03:46:18,720
The Momo Wisp path seems like it works.

3148
03:46:19,580 --> 03:46:21,600
Tara gets to eat the body and mint the soul.

3149
03:46:23,540 --> 03:46:23,580
Yeah.

3150
03:46:24,380 --> 03:46:27,440
It's a parasocial relationship.

3151
03:46:29,260 --> 03:46:30,780
Cashing in some life force for twin tails.

3152
03:46:33,540 --> 03:46:35,500
Can we get Hime cut twin tails?

3153
03:46:35,660 --> 03:46:36,100
Oh my gosh.

3154
03:46:38,400 --> 03:46:46,200

03:47:40,100 --> 03:47:42,860
My last outfit here or in heaven?

Jump scare.

It's so funny.

3164
03:48:03,280 --> 03:48:04,680
She came out of nowhere.

3165
03:48:05,220 --> 03:48:05,880
Oh my god.

3166
03:48:09,840 --> 03:48:13,060

3170
03:48:50,600 --> 03:48:51,900
Mint 1.0, my beloved.

3171
03:48:55,780 --> 03:48:57,320
Yeah, jump scare.

3172
03:49:02,780 --> 03:49:05,980
She's the old mint, but she's from the past.

3173
03:49:06,360 --> 03:49:09,600
So doesn't that make you the old mint?

3174
03:49:15,080 --> 03:49:15,420
Wait.

3175
03:49:16,540 --> 03:49:18,040
She's the old mint.

3176
03:49:19,880 --> 03:49:20,000
Wait.

3177
03:49:26,960 --> 03:49:27,900
I'm confused.

3178
03:49:32,560 --> 03:49:35,660
I heard someone mentioned my obsession with ponytails.

3179
03:49:36,040 --> 03:49:36,940
Ponytail mint win.

3180
03:49:37,580 --> 03:49:38,020
I don't know.

3181
03:49:38,280 --> 03:49:44,760
I have to first even see if I'm staying and get a new outfit
then.

3182
03:49:45,620 --> 03:49:46,880
If all of that.

3183
03:49:49,040 --> 03:49:50,100
One step at a time.

3184
03:49:51,740 --> 03:50:00,160
one step at a time though if I get a new outfit I already
have an idea

3185
03:50:03,220 --> 03:50:06,560
yeah uh

3186
03:50:11,060 --> 03:50:16,140
anonymous thanks for the donation do you still have that so
I was a French maid who fell in love with the prince and I

3187
03:50:16,140 --> 03:50:22,660
got killed in the 14th century Yeah, my very extravagant
lore.

3188
03:50:23,660 --> 03:50:25,400
My very extravagant lore.

3189
03:50:27,740 --> 03:50:30,300
It's what turned me into a vengeful ghost, you know?

3190
03:50:31,980 --> 03:50:33,240
But, I don't know.

3191
03:50:33,380 --> 03:50:35,080
Maybe I was exaggerating a little bit.

3192
03:50:36,560 --> 03:50:38,640
I couldn't possibly get close with a prince.

3193
03:50:41,020 --> 03:50:41,760
I don't know.

3194
03:50:42,160 --> 03:50:43,360
Is that a light novel?

3195
03:50:44,360 --> 03:50:50,060
I was a French maid and I fell in love with a prince, but I
ended up dying in the 14th century.

3196
03:50:50,240 --> 03:50:58,480
And now I'm a ghost, destined to search the afterlife for
all of eternity.

3197
03:51:00,820 --> 03:51:01,380
Vengeful?

3198
03:51:01,620 --> 03:51:03,220
Yeah, I'm a vengeful ghost.

3199
03:51:05,440 --> 03:51:06,180
I've always have been.

3200
03:51:06,260 --> 03:51:07,660
I've always been a you day.

3201
03:51:10,440 --> 03:51:14,480
I guess we could put the cat ears on if it's for you.

3202
03:51:16,400 --> 03:51:18,080
Put your cat ears on.

3203
03:51:18,520 --> 03:51:19,440
Meow for me, kitten.

3204
03:51:20,240 --> 03:51:22,240
Meow for me kitten.

3205
03:51:33,600 --> 03:51:34,220
Meow.

3206
03:51:35,020 --> 03:51:36,020
Meow.

3207
03:51:36,680 --> 03:51:37,720
Meow.

3208
03:51:40,300 --> 03:51:40,880
Meow.

3209
03:51:41,680 --> 03:51:43,960
I may have missed it, but what is your cat's name?

3210
03:51:54,180 --> 03:51:54,940
Boo taro.

3211
03:52:02,380 --> 03:52:07,740
How do you feel about fan-made or fan-commissioned live 2D
or 3D models?

3212
03:52:08,560 --> 03:52:09,600
If you want to!

3213
03:52:09,840 --> 03:52:10,640
Oh my gosh, though.

3214
03:52:11,000 --> 03:52:11,560
That's like...

3215
03:52:12,160 --> 03:52:13,560
That's like a lot though, isn't it?

3216
03:52:14,360 --> 03:52:14,840
Stinky.

3217
03:52:18,800 --> 03:52:19,280
Butaro.

3218
03:52:20,620 --> 03:52:22,960
That's the first thing that came up in my brain.

3219
03:52:28,080 --> 03:52:29,480
Kind of like, butaiaro!

3220
03:52:30,560 --> 03:52:32,200
Because it's so stinky.

3221
03:52:32,760 --> 03:52:34,360
But he's also Boo Tarot.

3222
03:52:39,060 --> 03:52:40,060
Boo Tarot.

3223
03:52:40,180 --> 03:52:40,960
So, so, so, so.

3224
03:52:43,460 --> 03:52:43,740
Boo.

3225
03:52:44,600 --> 03:52:45,620
Yeah, like boo.

3226
03:52:51,280 --> 03:52:51,580
Yeah.

3227
03:52:53,740 --> 03:52:54,820
Sir stinks a lot.

3228
03:52:55,540 --> 03:52:56,660
Boruto's dad.

3229
03:52:57,080 --> 03:52:58,260
You're a student.

3230
03:53:01,000 --> 03:53:04,440
Don't worry, the game I want isn't on sale yet so I can
spare this.

3231
03:53:06,800 --> 03:53:09,340
Welcome back, Minto Phantom from the Made Mid channel.

3232
03:53:09,440 --> 03:53:10,380
Thanks, Gonzalia!

3233
03:53:11,920 --> 03:53:13,220
It's been a while.

3234
03:53:13,720 --> 03:53:14,140
Hello.

3235
03:53:22,290 --> 03:53:22,810
Yeah.

3236
03:53:26,330 --> 03:53:29,330
Play the Ghostbusters game PS3.

3237
03:53:30,150 --> 03:53:31,050
Why is it any good?

3238
03:53:31,950 --> 03:53:33,170
Is it something you suggest?

3239
03:53:33,750 --> 03:53:35,350
I can't wait for Zoom Beanie's tomorrow.

3240
03:53:35,970 --> 03:53:38,030
Zoom Beanie's was maybe...

3241
03:53:38,030 --> 03:53:44,050
So as a kid, I only played like a handful of those Edgium
Attainment games, right?

3242
03:53:44,770 --> 03:53:46,050
And one was Zoom Beanie's.

3243
03:53:46,170 --> 03:53:46,870
That was my favorite.

3244
03:53:47,290 --> 03:53:50,530
And the other one was Freddy Fish in the Haunted
Schoolhouse.

3245
03:53:51,890 --> 03:53:55,490
Out of like those like Freddy Fish in the...

3246
03:53:55,490 --> 03:53:56,530
There's the car.

3247
03:53:57,230 --> 03:54:00,050
And then there's like that one kid that looks like Danny
Phantom.

3248
03:54:00,690 --> 03:54:03,070
But out of like that whole...

3249
03:54:05,950 --> 03:54:07,670
Edumotainment Cinematic Universe.

3250
03:54:07,970 --> 03:54:14,790
I only owned that one single Freddy Fish haunted
schoolhouse.

3251
03:54:15,390 --> 03:54:16,410
Pajama Sam!

3252
03:54:16,650 --> 03:54:17,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3253
03:54:17,630 --> 03:54:18,130
A Puppet.

3254
03:54:18,390 --> 03:54:20,790
See, I don't know their names because I never owned the
games.

3255
03:54:21,790 --> 03:54:25,250
I only knew Freddy Fish.

3256
03:54:25,570 --> 03:54:30,410
And only because I was interested because it was a game
about a haunted schoolhouse.

3257
03:54:32,270 --> 03:54:33,670
I was like...

3258
03:54:33,750 --> 03:54:35,530
He's just like me!

3259
03:54:36,130 --> 03:54:37,270
I was like, oh my gosh.

3260
03:54:37,990 --> 03:54:40,130
I'm rooting for the ghost, baby.

3261
03:54:42,510 --> 03:54:43,470
But, um...

3262
03:54:43,470 --> 03:54:48,870
Yeah, so I would play that all the time, and I would play
Zumbini's all the time.

3263
03:54:48,970 --> 03:54:50,270
Like, I've played...

3264
03:54:50,270 --> 03:54:55,710
I can probably quote more Zumbini's than I think is healthy.

3265
03:54:57,350 --> 03:54:58,310
Welcome back, boys.

3266
03:54:58,370 --> 03:54:59,130
Thank you for the Akadata.

3267
03:54:59,250 --> 03:54:59,790
Thank you!

3268
03:55:02,110 --> 03:55:03,730
Could you get close to a prince?

3269
03:55:03,750 --> 03:55:07,090
if they were a cute girl, or if they were a hot old man.

3270
03:55:08,550 --> 03:55:08,950
Hi.

3271
03:55:10,450 --> 03:55:10,790
Where?

3272
03:55:11,010 --> 03:55:11,150
What?

3273
03:55:15,310 --> 03:55:19,350
I was saying, like, if I'm a maid, there's not a way I'm
going to get close to a prince.

3274
03:55:20,250 --> 03:55:21,790
They're so princely, you know?

3275
03:55:25,510 --> 03:55:27,030
Sounds like a webtoon, though.

3276
03:55:27,730 --> 03:55:30,150
Sounds like a webtoon, I might even read.

3277
03:55:33,010 --> 03:55:35,310
I used to have the littlest creature games.

3278
03:55:35,690 --> 03:55:36,810
And the Wishbone one.

3279
03:55:37,010 --> 03:55:37,890
I don't know those ones.

3280
03:55:38,550 --> 03:55:41,050
I don't know if you're familiar with either, but Wishbone
was my favorite thing.

3281
03:55:41,190 --> 03:55:43,810
Wishbone was the dog, the detective dog, right?

3282
03:55:44,470 --> 03:55:46,070
I watched it a little bit.

3283
03:55:47,170 --> 03:55:47,690
Fleens.

3284
03:55:48,310 --> 03:55:49,770
You're not fleens.

3285
03:55:50,990 --> 03:55:54,590
Well, whatever you are, make me a pizza.

3286
03:55:57,950 --> 03:55:58,470
Yes!

3287
03:55:59,130 --> 03:56:01,210
Oh my gosh, I love the pizza guy.

3288
03:56:01,450 --> 03:56:04,070

03:57:03,190 --> 03:57:03,530
I know.

3295
03:57:04,830 --> 03:57:06,290
It's actually the freedom.

3296
03:57:08,990 --> 03:57:15,250
It's kind of overwhelming where I'm just like when I was
trying to when I was making like thinking of the schedule

3297
03:57:15,250 --> 03:57:17,210
for for next week.

3298
03:57:17,370 --> 03:57:18,010
I was like.

3299
03:57:21,130 --> 03:57:25,710
Like I don't maybe I shouldn't like just start off with all
the things that I wanted to play.

3300
03:57:26,590 --> 03:57:28,790
But in the end I kind of did that.

3301
03:57:32,190 --> 03:57:40,530
now what changed and heaven you know it's a little bit
strict because you know you got to follow those heavenly

3302
03:57:40,530 --> 03:57:50,050
rules all those you know you got to be a good pure soul so
Zumbini's was not good and pure apparently

3303
03:57:56,950 --> 03:58:07,130
more topping but question do you prefer hot dog or pizza
probably pizza yeah probably pizza

3304
03:58:12,570 --> 03:58:19,050

3305
03:58:22,670 --> 03:58:31,990
and then the narrator he's just like Like, the Zumbinis are
off.

3306
03:58:32,670 --> 03:58:37,190
The Zumbinis are going to the promised land.

3307
03:58:37,730 --> 03:58:41,430
The Zumbinis, I don't, why, why are they going there?

3308
03:58:41,550 --> 03:58:42,260
I don't even know.

3309
03:58:45,450 --> 03:58:47,810
Fatal Frame, Ace Attorney waiting room.

03:58:48,910 --> 03:58:51,730

3311
03:58:52,910 --> 03:58:56,570

I can't even say when it will be out because I have no idea.

3327
04:01:05,460 --> 04:01:07,040
We have a sort of plan.

3328
04:01:08,920 --> 04:01:10,020
This game sounds super familiar.

3329
04:01:10,840 --> 04:01:13,100
Did you know if this game was ever part of a real arcade?

3330
04:01:14,140 --> 04:01:15,300
I don't know.

3331
04:01:16,100 --> 04:01:19,320
Also, speaking of real arcade, please play Granny in
Paradise some days.

3332
04:01:19,580 --> 04:01:21,000
It's about an old lady rescuing her cats.

3333
04:01:21,200 --> 04:01:21,960
It's 10 out of 10.

3334
04:01:22,340 --> 04:01:23,200
I will look into that.

3335
04:01:23,260 --> 04:01:23,680
Thank you.

3336
04:01:25,120 --> 04:01:26,280
You are a simp.

3337
04:01:26,420 --> 04:01:27,340
Thank you, welcome back.

3338
04:01:27,500 --> 04:01:28,100
Thank you.

3339
04:01:28,660 --> 04:01:35,340
Ghostbusters PS3 360M is really good and has all four
original Ghostbusters actors reunited for one last time.

3340
04:01:35,580 --> 04:01:36,300
No way, really?

3341
04:01:37,660 --> 04:01:41,740
So after Ghostbusters 2, it's basically Ghostbusters 3
before we actually got more Ghostbusters.

3342
04:01:41,960 --> 04:01:42,380
What?

3343
04:01:43,300 --> 04:01:45,180
Wait, that's actually so awesome.

3344
04:01:46,140 --> 04:01:47,100
It's really good.

3345
04:01:48,760 --> 04:01:49,980
Hi, Mintel, how's it going?

3346
04:01:50,660 --> 04:01:51,520
I'm good.

3347
04:01:51,900 --> 04:01:52,320
I'm good.

3348
04:01:52,480 --> 04:01:52,920
I'm good.

3349
04:01:54,440 --> 04:01:56,400
Thanks for stopping by.

3350
04:01:57,360 --> 04:01:58,820
Have you played Devil May Cry before?

3351
04:01:59,060 --> 04:01:59,600
I haven't.

3352
04:02:00,300 --> 04:02:01,120
We can play that too.

3353
04:02:04,680 --> 04:02:08,560
Minta, I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm starting to worry
that Snake isn't going to find his way out of the jungle.

3354
04:02:10,020 --> 04:02:11,160
Part of me is worried.

3355
04:02:11,340 --> 04:02:18,880
What if it, like, you know how, like, if you leave a screen
on for so long, like, that image will burn into the screen?

3356
04:02:19,900 --> 04:02:21,280
I'm, like, concerned about that a little.

3357
04:02:21,440 --> 04:02:24,540
I really wanted to get to, like, the...

3358
04:02:26,740 --> 04:02:27,700
I really...

3359
04:02:27,700 --> 04:02:29,320
Oh, we got forked again.

3360
04:02:29,900 --> 04:02:31,260
I really wanted to get to the...

3361
04:02:31,260 --> 04:02:32,200
Oh my god, we got...

3362
04:02:32,200 --> 04:02:32,460
What?

3363
04:02:33,060 --> 04:02:33,140
What?

3364
04:02:34,380 --> 04:02:35,100
Um, again.

3365
04:02:35,960 --> 04:02:37,000
Wow, both in a row.

3366
04:02:37,240 --> 04:02:37,660
That's in...

3367
04:02:38,800 --> 04:02:39,160
Ah!

3368
04:02:42,250 --> 04:02:43,950
Did you see my hand?

3369
04:02:45,770 --> 04:02:46,790
No, you didn't.

3370
04:02:52,400 --> 04:02:53,940
Um, you saw nothing.

3371
04:02:55,020 --> 04:02:55,800
You saw nothing.

3372
04:02:56,760 --> 04:02:57,560
You saw nothing.

3373
04:02:57,560 --> 04:02:57,840
You saw nothing.

3374
04:03:08,490 --> 04:03:09,170
Anyway.

3375
04:03:11,770 --> 04:03:12,570
Shut up, Sokolov!

3376
04:03:12,970 --> 04:03:14,150
This isn't about you!

3377
04:03:18,230 --> 04:03:26,930
She manifested this because I think I got some energy from
Zumbini's.

3378
04:03:27,290 --> 04:03:33,170
So I was able to, you know, partially have a physical form.

3379
04:03:33,270 --> 04:03:36,230
Not physical, but like a, how do you say?

3380
04:03:38,950 --> 04:03:53,170
a uh what is it called oh my gosh i don't even know my own
ghost terminology um yeah corp corporeal an apparition yeah

3381
04:03:53,170 --> 04:03:53,910
yeah yeah

3382
04:03:58,270 --> 04:04:09,470
i wonder how do i get back to demo mode oh i think oh i know
why it's because Because I have all these credits.

3383
04:04:10,730 --> 04:04:12,250
I have to get rid of the credits first.

3384
04:04:13,030 --> 04:04:14,450
But I'm like stuck at 50.

3385
04:04:15,690 --> 04:04:17,490
I see you now.

3386
04:04:17,870 --> 04:04:19,050
I see you now.

3387
04:04:27,730 --> 04:04:29,950
I moved all of my stuff around.

3388
04:04:32,030 --> 04:04:34,730
I'll just do stuff while we're talking.

3389
04:04:35,330 --> 04:04:36,650
Don't mind the background, okay?

3390
04:04:37,190 --> 04:04:37,990
Don't mind the background.

3391
04:04:38,010 --> 04:04:38,430
ground.

3392
04:04:39,770 --> 04:04:40,030
What the?

3393
04:04:41,190 --> 04:04:41,430
Again?

3394
04:04:43,850 --> 04:04:44,870
Okay, hold on.

3395
04:04:45,590 --> 04:04:47,290
Maybe we can beat this one this time.

3396
04:04:50,730 --> 04:04:51,290
Maybe we can beat.

3397
04:04:52,130 --> 04:04:53,790
Maybe I can beat this one this time.

3398
04:04:58,010 --> 04:04:58,570
Nice.

3399
04:05:03,650 --> 04:05:05,070
Oh, Jose.

3400
04:05:19,310 --> 04:05:29,590
What are the chances of getting that I think I'm stuck on
credits forever I think the game just said yeah you know

3401
04:05:29,590 --> 04:05:40,250
what you will get unlimited money you don't have to pay can
you imagine if this happened in the actual thing like in the

3402
04:05:40,250 --> 04:05:52,850
actual arcade if you just could play forever she's so wait
did I come on what are the odds of If it's 50-50, I'm gonna

3403
04:05:52,850 --> 04:05:54,050
pull my hair out.

3404
04:05:54,350 --> 04:05:55,310
It can't be 50-50.

3405
04:05:56,070 --> 04:05:57,190
It has to be more, right?

3406
04:06:07,180 --> 04:06:08,560
Look at him go.

3407
04:06:09,420 --> 04:06:09,640

I can only like understand a little bit.

3431
04:07:46,900 --> 04:07:49,520
I think they want me to continue.

3432
04:07:50,840 --> 04:07:51,280
Advantage.

3433
04:07:51,920 --> 04:07:52,980
Okay, yeah, the rush.

There we go, is that better?

3439
04:08:09,920 --> 04:08:10,180
Great!

3440
04:08:13,200 --> 04:08:14,320
What is happening?

3441
04:08:15,080 --> 04:08:16,320
What is going on?

3442
04:08:17,500 --> 04:08:18,360
What is going on?

3443
04:08:18,520 --> 04:08:19,920
I have a safety zone now!

3444
04:08:21,280 --> 04:08:22,220
Oh my god.

3445
04:08:23,420 --> 04:08:24,300
What is happening?

3446
04:08:25,280 --> 04:08:30,240
Oh, they're getting the save data, so that's what I'm doing
while it's like retrieving the save data.

3447
04:08:30,400 --> 04:08:32,100
I was like, hello, am I gonna go into the bite?

3448
04:08:38,180 --> 04:08:38,880
No way.

3449
04:08:41,840 --> 04:08:44,540
Oh my god.

3450
04:08:45,140 --> 04:08:49,380
Highway to the safety zone.

3451
04:08:50,460 --> 04:09:03,620
Oh my god, we're

3452
04:09:09,020 --> 04:09:11,740
back where we were before.

3453
04:09:13,580 --> 04:09:14,360
Absolutely insane.

3454
04:09:14,840 --> 04:09:17,360
I don't have my stuff set up, so I'm sorry that it keeps
freezing.

3455
04:09:18,380 --> 04:09:18,640
Hold on.

3456
04:09:18,760 --> 04:09:21,900
I'm gonna, like, go down here so it doesn't look as weird,
maybe.

3457
04:09:22,680 --> 04:09:23,520
He has less HP!

3458
04:09:23,720 --> 04:09:23,960
Yeah!

3459
04:09:25,640 --> 04:09:26,640
Oh my gosh.

3460
04:09:28,060 --> 04:09:28,740
Okay, guys.

3461
04:09:29,640 --> 04:09:30,520

3464
04:09:32,920 --> 04:09:34,540
This is how we'll end the stream.

3465
04:09:37,840 --> 04:09:39,720
And we have the safety zone!

3466
04:09:42,880 --> 04:09:43,320
Nice.

3467
04:09:44,720 --> 04:09:45,240
Yes.

3468
04:09:51,020 --> 04:09:52,240
You know what?

3469
04:09:52,320 --> 04:09:52,740
I will.

3470
04:09:59,120 --> 04:09:59,640
Nice.

3471
04:09:59,860 --> 04:10:01,060
Oh, that did a good amount.

3472
04:10:01,960 --> 04:10:03,820
Wait, my safety zone is going down.

3473
04:10:04,820 --> 04:10:05,920
Why is it going down?

3474
04:10:07,040 --> 04:10:07,400
Uh-oh.

3475
04:10:07,680 --> 04:10:08,080
This is...

3476
04:10:10,640 --> 04:10:12,540
Do it, Palpatine boys.

3477
04:10:13,460 --> 04:10:13,980
Palpatine.

3478
04:10:16,000 --> 04:10:16,520
Oh.

3479
04:10:17,520 --> 04:10:19,300
He's like, he talks a lot.

3480
04:10:23,660 --> 04:10:25,520
He's just excited, Snake.

3481
04:10:25,860 --> 04:10:26,780
He's just really excited.

3482
04:10:27,700 --> 04:10:29,480
Oh my gosh, thank you for the Haku-Toro!

3483
04:10:30,980 --> 04:10:32,420
Damn, X, thank you!

3484
04:10:33,640 --> 04:10:34,880
Glad we have cat ears now.

3485
04:10:35,000 --> 04:10:36,440
I think we needed that extra pair of ears.

3486
04:10:36,600 --> 04:10:39,360
I'm so sorry, I feel really bad for real.

3487
04:10:40,220 --> 04:10:41,240
I feel so bad.

3488
04:10:44,920 --> 04:10:46,140
Oh, he's shooting!

3489
04:10:46,520 --> 04:10:48,520
But because we have the safety zone...

3490
04:10:49,740 --> 04:10:50,080
Oh!

3491
04:10:50,980 --> 04:10:51,700
Yes, my God.

3492
04:10:52,380 --> 04:10:53,200
Oh, my God.

3493
04:10:56,380 --> 04:10:58,120
Oh, my God.

3494
04:10:58,640 --> 04:10:59,100
I don't...

3495
04:10:59,920 --> 04:11:02,340
Oh, I hope we get another rush.

3496
04:11:02,640 --> 04:11:03,300
Oh, yes!

3497
04:11:03,660 --> 04:11:04,160
Oh, my God!

3498
04:11:04,280 --> 04:11:04,440
Yes!

3499
04:11:04,540 --> 04:11:05,040
Rush, rush, rush!

3500
04:11:05,860 --> 04:11:06,460
Oh, my God.

3501
04:11:07,960 --> 04:11:08,760
Oh, my God!

3502
04:11:08,900 --> 04:11:09,540
Wait, you guys.

3503
04:11:10,220 --> 04:11:11,780

3504
04:11:11,780 --> 04:11:12,980
No way, no way, no way, no way.

3505
04:11:13,060 --> 04:11:14,000
Oh, I'm getting my hopes up.

3506
04:11:14,060 --> 04:11:14,360
No, no, no.

3507
04:11:14,460 --> 04:11:15,240
I'm not gonna get my hopes up.

3516
04:13:13,660 --> 04:13:15,520
Oh, here they come, the bees!

3517
04:13:17,540 --> 04:13:17,980
Oh!

3518
04:13:18,940 --> 04:13:20,100
He found us.

3519
04:13:22,020 --> 04:13:23,800
Oh my god, thank you for the donation!

3520
04:13:24,300 --> 04:13:25,600
Oh my god!

3521
04:13:26,520 --> 04:13:27,640
Oh my god!

3522
04:13:27,960 --> 04:13:28,320
Awesome!

3523
04:13:28,500 --> 04:13:29,240
Oh my gosh, Pig!

3524
04:13:29,340 --> 04:13:30,280
Thank you for that, Katoya!

3525
04:13:31,260 --> 04:13:35,180
You're really back, I'm out of the country right now, so I
can't watch too often, but here's a donut!

3526
04:13:35,280 --> 04:13:36,280
Thank you!

3527
04:13:37,020 --> 04:13:43,040
It's not as much as I used to do, but it should cover the
three years of membership if you would let that continue.

3528
04:13:43,360 --> 04:13:45,900
Okay, and now it's time to enjoy some of our face.

3529
04:13:45,960 --> 04:13:47,000
Thank you!

3530
04:13:48,100 --> 04:13:49,100
I'm back!

3531
04:13:50,140 --> 04:13:51,100
He's Sashiburi!

3532
04:13:51,820 --> 04:13:52,320
Sorry.

3533
04:13:52,780 --> 04:13:53,360
Oh my gosh.

3534
04:13:55,440 --> 04:13:55,940
Yeah!

3535
04:13:57,140 --> 04:13:57,640
Oh!

3536
04:14:00,560 --> 04:14:02,140
That's what the... It says to push.

3537
04:14:02,420 --> 04:14:04,040
It said push, so I pushed it.

3538
04:14:04,440 --> 04:14:05,200
I paused it.

3539
04:14:08,360 --> 04:14:11,820
I can't believe we clutch that, you guys.

3540
04:14:12,840 --> 04:14:13,900
I cannot believe.

3541
04:14:14,800 --> 04:14:19,800
Wait, so now, are we going to be in the forest, or...

3542
04:14:21,100 --> 04:14:23,000
Oh, my God.

3543
04:14:23,620 --> 04:14:24,760
Oh, my God.

3544
04:14:28,280 --> 04:14:28,980
Oh, my God.

3545
04:14:29,720 --> 04:14:30,840
Oh, my God.

3546
04:14:32,160 --> 04:14:34,080
We're in a new area.

3547
04:14:35,340 --> 04:14:36,240
Oh, my God.

3548
04:14:36,420 --> 04:14:37,300
I'm going to cry.

3549
04:14:39,920 --> 04:14:41,060
We're talking to you.

3554
04:15:39,600 --> 04:15:41,080
I was here!

3555
04:15:42,360 --> 04:15:43,240
Oh, the end!

3556
04:15:43,580 --> 04:15:44,400
Oh my god, wait!

3557
04:15:47,840 --> 04:15:49,560
Are we going to fight the end?

3558
04:15:50,560 --> 04:15:51,120
No way.

3559
04:15:54,720 --> 04:16:00,940
Wait, remember how I said, if you were here, I said earlier
at the beginning of the stream, I've never seen the end,

3560
04:16:01,180 --> 04:16:03,440
I've never seen his fight before in this.

3561
04:16:03,440 --> 04:16:06,240
So I'm like, yo, I wanted to see...

3562
04:16:06,240 --> 04:16:07,340

Nice!

3565
04:16:09,840 --> 04:16:10,380
Good job, Snake.

3566
04:16:11,180 --> 04:16:11,280
Oh!

3567
04:16:16,660 --> 04:16:17,900
What is going on?

3568
04:16:18,100 --> 04:16:19,060
What is actually happening?

3569
04:16:19,340 --> 04:16:20,140
What is going on?

3570
04:16:20,360 --> 04:16:21,400
What is happening?

3571
04:16:21,520 --> 04:16:22,240
What is happening?

3572
04:16:22,920 --> 04:16:23,360
What is happening?

3573
04:16:23,580 --> 04:16:24,580
CQC time?

3574
04:16:25,380 --> 04:16:25,780
Yo!

3575
04:16:26,160 --> 04:16:27,840
Hold on, let me, uh, do this too.

3576
04:16:28,140 --> 04:16:28,800
I'm gonna end the poll.

3577
04:16:34,400 --> 04:16:36,520
Do you think the first part was like the tutorial?

3578
04:16:38,640 --> 04:16:39,160
No.

3579
04:16:40,040 --> 04:16:40,320
No.

3580
04:16:40,320 --> 04:16:41,300
Right!

3581
04:16:42,740 --> 04:16:43,220
Oh?

3582
04:16:45,060 --> 04:16:45,620
Oh?

3583
04:16:45,620 --> 04:16:46,580
Oh, come on.

3584
04:16:47,220 --> 04:16:47,480
What?

3585
04:16:53,560 --> 04:16:54,420
Oh, what?

3586
04:16:54,420 --> 04:16:54,640
Okay.

3587
04:16:56,440 --> 04:16:56,780
Okay.

3588
04:16:59,540 --> 04:17:03,340
I didn't get the boss fight, but, you know, I got 30 Gs.

3589
04:17:04,600 --> 04:17:05,180
Let me fight!

3590
04:17:05,760 --> 04:17:06,440
Okay, wait, wait.

3591
04:17:06,780 --> 04:17:08,200
We have to keep fighting these guys.

3592
04:17:08,340 --> 04:17:09,360
We have to keep CQCing.

3593
04:17:10,660 --> 04:17:12,440
And getting so many Kodakos.

3594
04:17:12,460 --> 04:17:13,400
it calls.

3595
04:17:15,460 --> 04:17:16,100
Thank you!

3596
04:17:16,640 --> 04:17:18,400
You're pretty good.

3597
04:17:19,840 --> 04:17:23,660
Let me fight.

3598
04:17:24,300 --> 04:17:29,260
Let me... Let me fight!

3599
04:17:31,500 --> 04:17:33,220
Let me fight!

3600
04:17:39,320 --> 04:17:42,240
Hello, Sagan.

3601
04:17:44,980 --> 04:17:45,600
I don't like you.

3602
04:17:45,700 --> 04:17:47,420
I don't like paramedic either anymore.

3603
04:17:47,500 --> 04:17:49,840
I don't like any of those guys anymore, but you know.

3604
04:17:51,480 --> 04:17:52,580
Let me fight.

3605
04:17:53,100 --> 04:17:53,320
I went

3606
04:17:56,900 --> 04:17:58,860
from heaven explosion sector.

3607
04:17:59,420 --> 04:18:00,580
Very friendly to ghosts.

3608
04:18:04,760 --> 04:18:06,220
Let me fight.

3609
04:18:08,940 --> 04:18:10,900
Let me fight.

3610
04:18:12,380 --> 04:18:14,300
We're so good at CQC, guys.

3611
04:18:14,460 --> 04:18:15,600
We're still like the best ever.

3612
04:18:18,560 --> 04:18:20,000
We've walked so much.

3613
04:18:22,600 --> 04:18:24,620
Look at it, we keep getting straight walking.

3614
04:18:25,240 --> 04:18:26,600
We're just walking, walking, walking.

3615
04:18:26,740 --> 04:18:27,500
We're a walking crew.

3616
04:18:30,020 --> 04:18:31,100
I'm bloodthirsty.

3617
04:18:32,800 --> 04:18:34,420
I'm just flipping all these guys.

3618
04:18:35,180 --> 04:18:35,820
They never see it.

3619
04:18:36,000 --> 04:18:37,740
Never see it coming!

3620
04:18:48,060 --> 04:18:49,660
Come on, hold on, Paramount.

3621
04:18:50,280 --> 04:18:51,760
Oh, oh, I need a tip.

3622
04:18:52,640 --> 04:18:53,180
To battle.

3623
04:19:00,110 --> 04:19:00,990
Keep going.

3624
04:19:02,390 --> 04:19:03,610
She's got a taste for blood.

3625
04:19:05,830 --> 04:19:07,710
Oh, I did it out of order, but that's okay.

3626
04:19:09,570 --> 04:19:10,370
Is it double audio?

3627
04:19:10,910 --> 04:19:10,910
Yeah.

3628
04:19:11,390 --> 04:19:12,430
Sorry, I do that.

3629
04:19:12,610 --> 04:19:13,690
I have a...

3630
04:19:17,460 --> 04:19:19,300
So sorry that it's a little distracting.

3631
04:19:19,800 --> 04:19:21,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hello.

3632
04:19:22,220 --> 04:19:22,900
Hello, sorrow.

3633
04:19:31,940 --> 04:19:32,380
Cheers!

3634
04:19:34,700 --> 04:19:35,140
No.

3635
04:19:38,080 --> 04:19:41,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't put me back here, please.

3636
04:19:41,700 --> 04:19:42,440
No, God, please.

3637
04:19:43,060 --> 04:19:43,920
Please, God, no.

3638
04:19:45,380 --> 04:19:46,000
Oh, okay.

3639
04:19:50,020 --> 04:19:50,340
Oh.

3640
04:19:54,260 --> 04:19:55,860
I don't know what this means.

3641
04:19:56,000 --> 04:20:00,360
So there's, like, things written here on these buttons on
the walkie-talkie here.

3642
04:20:00,480 --> 04:20:02,860
It says Trans Saver is the first one that's green.

3643
04:20:03,320 --> 04:20:05,860
The second one is Sensor Sotar, but it's red.

3644
04:20:06,180 --> 04:20:07,540
And the third one is Emergency.

3645
04:20:07,560 --> 04:20:08,760
see, but it's green.

3646
04:20:09,660 --> 04:20:09,900
Oh!

3647
04:20:11,960 --> 04:20:13,120
What's going on?

3648
04:20:13,920 --> 04:20:18,740
I can't say I know what it is.

3649
04:20:18,880 --> 04:20:19,240
Oh!

3650
04:20:19,820 --> 04:20:21,000
Big boss time?

3651
04:20:33,100 --> 04:20:33,440
No!

3652
04:20:35,240 --> 04:20:36,900
Oh, wait, he's saying new things now.

3653
04:20:38,760 --> 04:20:39,920
Okay, I think we're still in.

3654
04:20:40,640 --> 04:20:41,540
I think we're still good.

3655
04:20:44,420 --> 04:20:47,800
God, how long do people just sit here and play this to be
able to get to this?

3656
04:20:49,260 --> 04:20:50,060
this far.

3657
04:20:53,380 --> 04:20:54,600
Endless circle of.

3658
04:20:59,170 --> 04:21:01,670
We just gotta keep getting through the woods.

3659
04:21:03,170 --> 04:21:04,850
Back to flipping guys, yeah.

3660
04:21:05,250 --> 04:21:05,970
More tips.

3661
04:21:07,810 --> 04:21:15,810
Yeah, but like, it's like, yeah, I get the, so it's like, I
get it, but it's just like, how do I, it says the tips, like

3662
04:21:15,810 --> 04:21:20,550
the colors are being, like you'll get the better stuff based
on the color, but I'm like, how do I get the colors?

3663
04:21:20,570 --> 04:21:20,910
Huh?

3664
04:21:21,370 --> 04:21:22,450
How do I get the, you know?

3665
04:21:22,810 --> 04:21:25,530
Like they don't, they act like it's not just pure luck.

3666
04:21:26,350 --> 04:21:27,930
And also, this thing is rigged as hell!

3667
04:21:28,350 --> 04:21:30,910
I keep getting the same thing over and over again.

3668
04:21:40,250 --> 04:21:40,650
Like...

3669
04:21:40,650 --> 04:21:41,650
Skill issue.

3670
04:21:42,190 --> 04:21:43,010
Yeah, basically.

3671
04:21:53,460 --> 04:21:57,600
Oh, now we have the sensor, but we don't have the trans- Oh,
wait, the trans...

3672
04:21:57,600 --> 04:21:59,380
The trans saver is blinking.

3673
04:21:59,960 --> 04:22:00,360
Interesting.

3674
04:22:00,620 --> 04:22:03,360
I don't know why it's blinking like that, but now he just
said that- Oh!

3675
04:22:03,580 --> 04:22:05,200
Oh, now we have the sensor too.

3676
04:22:05,560 --> 04:22:07,100
Oh, cool.

3677
04:22:10,820 --> 04:22:11,620
Thank you!

3678
04:22:12,340 --> 04:22:17,240
I usually just lurk, but I can't stay long, so when I wish
you an amazing day, thank you for being a fantastic person

3679
04:22:17,240 --> 04:22:18,640
and for the amazing time, why is it your name?

3680
04:22:18,700 --> 04:22:19,700
Thank you!

3681
04:22:19,900 --> 04:22:22,020
Your- your- your name is so crazy.

3682
04:22:22,400 --> 04:22:25,840
S-L-I-D-3-3-F-E-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B.

3683
04:22:25,840 --> 04:22:26,980
Thank you.

3684
04:22:29,660 --> 04:22:30,060
Fox?

3685
04:22:30,680 --> 04:22:31,080
Fox!

3686
04:22:33,460 --> 04:22:38,740
Oh, I wonder if the transceiver goes red when we're using
the codec.

3687
04:22:39,320 --> 04:22:42,280
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, maybe.

3688
04:22:43,680 --> 04:22:44,500
Okay, please.

3689
04:22:45,260 --> 04:22:45,920
Alright, snake.

3690
04:22:47,260 --> 04:22:47,420
Oh.

3691
04:22:54,920 --> 04:22:56,360
Okay, keep going.

3692
04:23:02,200 --> 04:23:03,480
Gotta head to bed.

3693
04:23:03,560 --> 04:23:04,360
Good night.

3694
04:23:07,790 --> 04:23:08,770
Don't worry.

3695
04:23:09,890 --> 04:23:12,490
I don't want to see if we get to the boss, bad.

3696
04:23:14,070 --> 04:23:16,690
If I lose the next one, then we'll call it quits.

3697
04:23:17,410 --> 04:23:17,610
You know?

3698
04:23:18,230 --> 04:23:20,290
I just want to try one more time.

3699
04:23:27,630 --> 04:23:28,010
Fox.

3700
04:23:30,790 --> 04:23:31,310
Okay.

3701
04:23:31,730 --> 04:23:32,230
Alright guys.

3702
04:23:34,830 --> 04:23:35,250
Two!

3703
04:23:38,330 --> 04:23:38,850
Three!

3704
04:23:53,510 --> 04:23:54,950
First movement!

3705
04:23:55,310 --> 04:23:56,630
Oh my god!

3706
04:24:00,980 --> 04:24:03,100
It's the actual game!

3707
04:24:03,560 --> 04:24:05,300
It's the actual game cutscene!

3708
04:24:06,500 --> 04:24:07,220
Oh my god.

3709
04:24:07,580 --> 04:24:08,580
Oh my god.

3710
04:24:08,840 --> 04:24:09,440
Oh my god.

3711
04:24:09,700 --> 04:24:10,340
Oh my god.

3712
04:24:16,720 --> 04:24:17,280
Oh my god.

3713
04:24:17,560 --> 04:24:18,480
Oh my god.

3714
04:24:19,180 --> 04:24:19,660
Boss.

3715
04:24:23,860 --> 04:24:24,380
Win!

3716
04:24:33,470 --> 04:24:34,930
Can't believe you use your goose.

3717
04:24:34,950 --> 04:24:36,790
skills to grab a hold of luck.

3718
04:24:37,870 --> 04:24:38,590
This is...

3719
04:24:38,590 --> 04:24:39,670
Oh my god, the music?

3720
04:24:43,370 --> 04:24:46,490
Did you know there's actually a soundtrack for the Patchy
Slot.

3721
04:24:49,410 --> 04:24:50,290
So, uh...

3722
04:24:50,290 --> 04:24:54,870
If you like any of the versions of these songs, you can
actually get the CD for it.

3723
04:24:55,110 --> 04:24:56,030
I don't own it yet.

3724
04:24:56,790 --> 04:24:58,930
But after this song... Oh, it's...

3725
04:24:58,930 --> 04:24:59,750
It's so good.

3726
04:24:59,930 --> 04:25:00,570
Maybe I'll get it.

3727
04:25:01,590 --> 04:25:04,670
Okay, so I have... Big Boss time is 8 out of 30.

3728
04:25:04,950 --> 04:25:07,010
Okay, that's what it says.

3729
04:25:07,070 --> 04:25:07,370
Yeah.

3730
04:25:09,690 --> 04:25:10,490
Oh my god.

3731
04:25:11,850 --> 04:25:13,370
Remember the album!

3732
04:25:19,600 --> 04:25:19,620
Ah!

3733
04:25:23,160 --> 04:25:24,320
This is so ISO.

3734
04:25:25,080 --> 04:25:28,780
I don't know what's going on, to be honest, but it's kind of
fun to see the scenes.

3735
04:25:54,790 --> 04:25:55,270
Yo!

3736
04:26:01,240 --> 04:26:02,640
This is so ISO.

3737
04:26:02,800 --> 04:26:03,960
I'm so into this now.

3738
04:26:06,480 --> 04:26:08,920
It's 60s on!

3739
04:26:10,140 --> 04:26:11,190
Big payout.

3740
04:26:11,980 --> 04:26:12,960
Big money, baby!

3741
04:26:25,320 --> 04:26:28,060
Boss plot being like, what are you doing?

3742
04:26:28,720 --> 04:26:30,600
Don't be so crazy!

3743
04:26:32,360 --> 04:26:36,520
It's interesting that these scenes are from...

3744
04:26:36,520 --> 04:26:40,020
I guess they just didn't have maybe...

3745
04:26:40,020 --> 04:26:43,960
I don't know if it's the timing, but they didn't get to...

3746
04:26:49,140 --> 04:26:50,200
Fox engine.

3747
04:26:52,800 --> 04:26:53,660
Okay, we only have three more.

3748
04:26:54,760 --> 04:26:54,780
Oh.

3749
04:27:00,940 --> 04:27:01,640
Thank you!

3750
04:27:02,340 --> 04:27:06,850
I have my... my Hidari from Miki memorized now.

3751
04:27:07,210 --> 04:27:07,210
Thanks.

3752
04:27:07,730 --> 04:27:10,590
Thanks for the Japanese- Japanese-Josu listen!

3753
04:27:14,450 --> 04:27:16,330
And don't forget the manaka.

3754
04:27:17,330 --> 04:27:18,270
Manaka, the manaka.

3755
04:27:19,590 --> 04:27:21,630
I didn't think anyone would get this far.

3756
04:27:21,770 --> 04:27:22,350
Me either!

3757
04:27:22,570 --> 04:27:23,030
Oh my gosh!

3758
04:27:23,450 --> 04:27:23,450
Last?

3759
04:27:23,530 --> 04:27:24,210
Oh my gosh!

3760
04:27:24,690 --> 04:27:27,890
Oh my gosh, look at them.

3761
04:27:28,890 --> 04:27:31,270
They look so good.

3762
04:27:32,370 --> 04:27:33,570
Oh my god.

3763
04:27:35,290 --> 04:27:36,230
Look at them.

3764
04:27:36,470 --> 04:27:37,850
They look so amazing.

3765
04:27:38,570 --> 04:27:41,090
Oh, I've never seen this visual before.

3766
04:27:42,750 --> 04:27:43,910
Oh my gosh.

3767
04:27:44,510 --> 04:27:45,710
Oh my gosh.

3768
04:27:46,210 --> 04:27:47,610
Oh my gosh.

3769
04:27:47,670 --> 04:27:50,330
See the whole like codex set up on it?

3770
04:27:50,330 --> 04:27:51,390
Like this is so cool.

3771
04:27:51,510 --> 04:27:53,770
Oh my gosh, I've never seen this visual before.

3772
04:27:55,010 --> 04:27:58,870
Yo, they look so cute together.

3773
04:28:01,590 --> 04:28:02,150
Wow!

3774
04:28:03,490 --> 04:28:08,850
Oh my god, you can't see, but the exclamation point on the
side here is also lighting up Rainbow.

3775
04:28:12,090 --> 04:28:13,210
Second movement!

3776
04:28:14,170 --> 04:28:14,990
Oh my god!

3777
04:28:15,570 --> 04:28:16,710
Wait, this is awesome.

3778
04:28:19,970 --> 04:28:21,410
Oh my, you guys.

3779
04:28:22,570 --> 04:28:23,330
No way.

3780
04:28:24,130 --> 04:28:25,190
No way.

3781
04:28:25,370 --> 04:28:28,030
But also, why is this also...

3782
04:28:29,470 --> 04:28:32,210
From the... This is also original cutscene!

3783
04:28:33,790 --> 04:28:37,470
I thought I was under the impression that the whole thing
was Fox Engine.

3784
04:28:38,110 --> 04:28:38,990
Solid time?

3785
04:28:39,170 --> 04:28:41,210
Wait, what is this saying at the bottom here?

3786
04:28:42,170 --> 04:28:47,710
Oh my gosh, that's my favorite part about Metal Gear Solid
when he says, It's solid time!

3787
04:28:56,820 --> 04:29:00,920
Do you guys know this song?

3788
04:29:04,850 --> 04:29:06,050
Why is this song?

3789
04:29:14,130 --> 04:29:14,690
Oh, sorry.

3790
04:29:18,610 --> 04:29:22,970
But I was under the impression everything was Fox Engine
made, so...

3791
04:29:22,970 --> 04:29:32,560
This is the most unexpected development imaginable at the
end of this stream.

3792
04:29:38,520 --> 04:29:40,060
No, this doesn't sound like Donna Burke.

3793
04:29:45,350 --> 04:29:46,550
This is amazing!

3794
04:29:57,720 --> 04:29:58,780
Why is this song?

3795
04:30:01,220 --> 04:30:04,060
Okay, I'm definitely buying the soundtrack now.

3796
04:30:06,840 --> 04:30:08,360
I feel like crying.

3797
04:30:08,700 --> 04:30:09,580
It was so beautiful.

3798
04:30:09,760 --> 04:30:10,580
It's so beautiful.

3799
04:30:11,500 --> 04:30:12,580
Oh, we can do this and do it again.

3800
04:30:14,380 --> 04:30:16,520
Because we still have...

3801
04:30:17,080 --> 04:30:18,580
We have 40 out of 60.

3802
04:30:20,220 --> 04:30:23,640
Go ahead and...

3803
04:30:23,640 --> 04:30:24,740
This song goes hard.

3804
04:30:24,820 --> 04:30:25,340
It does!

3805
04:30:26,960 --> 04:30:29,560
I did not expect this to happen at all.

3806
04:30:29,800 --> 04:30:31,160
I'm so shocked.

3807
04:30:31,940 --> 04:30:32,700
This is so...

3808
04:30:32,700 --> 04:30:36,180
I'm so happy this happens for the first time on stream.

3809
04:30:36,640 --> 04:30:37,520
I can't believe.

3810
04:30:39,640 --> 04:30:40,640
Oh my god.

3811
04:30:41,820 --> 04:30:42,120
Sorry.

3812
04:30:42,760 --> 04:30:47,600
I feel like there might be people who will watch this, just
wanting to know more about the patchy slot.

3813
04:30:49,680 --> 04:30:56,640
And we'll just hear my obnoxious, like, screeching, my
Banshee screeching and my...

3814
04:30:56,820 --> 04:30:58,360
Annoying commentary.

3815
04:30:59,480 --> 04:31:00,240
Scissors.

3816
04:31:03,960 --> 04:31:07,320
Okay, I'm gonna be quiet so we can get more of the song.

3817
04:32:02,510 --> 04:32:04,050
I love this.

3818
04:32:04,690 --> 04:32:06,430
It's so good!

3819
04:32:07,050 --> 04:32:08,250
Sasuke got Metal Gear.

3820
04:32:08,870 --> 04:32:14,390
No matter what kind of Metal Gear it is, it has amazing
music.

3821
04:32:14,870 --> 04:32:16,390
Even as Apache Slot.

3822
04:32:18,770 --> 04:32:20,890
I need this song!

3823
04:32:21,690 --> 04:32:21,750
I need this song!

3824
04:32:21,750 --> 04:32:22,630
Oh my gosh.

3825
04:32:29,060 --> 04:32:30,360
Oh my god.

3826
04:32:31,160 --> 04:32:33,340
It's just so worth everything.

3827
04:32:34,440 --> 04:32:35,500
Oh, so thank you for the don't know.

3828
04:32:35,700 --> 04:32:38,580
Don't worry, this is the exact experience is what I was
hoping for tonight.

3829
04:32:41,100 --> 04:32:44,000
Man, the most obscure original Metal Gear song.

3830
04:32:44,780 --> 04:32:46,120
Correct me if I'm wrong.

3831
04:32:46,340 --> 04:32:48,660
Like, I don't recognize this song.

3832
04:32:49,120 --> 04:32:50,360
So, oh, it's over.

3833
04:32:51,320 --> 04:32:56,020
But if it's Apache slot exclusive, that's like insane.

3834
04:32:57,720 --> 04:33:02,160
Title is become the big boss second movement and seems to be
Apache slot original.

3835
04:33:02,560 --> 04:33:03,440
No way.

3836
04:33:04,580 --> 04:33:06,100
Oh my gosh.

3837
04:33:08,360 --> 04:33:09,260
Where are we now?

3838
04:33:09,500 --> 04:33:10,000
Sound force?

3839
04:33:14,860 --> 04:33:16,660
I don't wanna stop now.

3840
04:33:17,040 --> 04:33:18,020
This is like a cutscene.

3841
04:33:20,120 --> 04:33:27,020
Oh my god, I literally, I put my, like, I, I gasped and,
like, put my hand over my mouth.

3842
04:33:27,300 --> 04:33:28,000
Oh my god.

3843
04:33:31,360 --> 04:33:33,920
Oh my god, oh my god,

3844
04:33:37,530 --> 04:33:38,670
oh my god.

3845
04:33:39,550 --> 04:33:48,690
Oh, I just want to hear him say the, like, uh, what, what,
he says, uh, like, uh, oh, he's like, Sene, what he said,

3846
04:33:48,730 --> 04:33:57,450
I'm sorry, my brain is, like, literally melting right now
because I'm like the way he says like the snort like oh I'm

3847
04:33:57,450 --> 04:34:07,870
dying sorry I'm like actually oh my god I can't think oh my
god the bird

3848
04:34:19,100 --> 04:34:36,750
how does this fight work though this is the same as Ocelots
I'm sorry I'm like actually losing Oh my god!

3849
04:34:36,750 --> 04:34:37,130
Oh my god!

3850
04:34:37,230 --> 04:34:39,890
Thank you for the doughnuts, you guys!

3851
04:34:40,270 --> 04:34:43,570
Singer's name is apparently Sa- Sa- how do you say that
though?

3852
04:34:44,930 --> 04:34:48,770
I don't even know Apache Slot Soundtracks were a thing till
now, but like adding it to your collection, Min!

3853
04:34:48,790 --> 04:34:49,690
Thank you, Pinkerton!

3854
04:34:51,670 --> 04:34:55,070
Watching Min picking MGS and Apache slot history with this
stream.

3855
04:34:57,730 --> 04:34:57,930
Okay.

3856
04:34:58,270 --> 04:34:59,490
Oh, here here here here.

3857
04:34:59,990 --> 04:35:00,850
Here here.

3858
04:35:00,950 --> 04:35:01,390
Heavy!

3859
04:35:12,530 --> 04:35:13,990
Oh my god!

3860
04:35:14,070 --> 04:35:15,750
Oh I get goosebumps every time!

3861
04:35:15,990 --> 04:35:16,830
Every time!

3862
04:35:17,170 --> 04:35:18,150
Oh my god!

3863
04:35:23,070 --> 04:35:23,550
Oh!

3864
04:35:23,930 --> 04:35:24,410
Sorry.

3865
04:35:26,710 --> 04:35:27,710
I'm like...

3866
04:35:30,390 --> 04:35:31,750
I'm not reading all this.

3867
04:35:31,850 --> 04:35:32,090
Wait.

3868
04:35:32,310 --> 04:35:33,370
I think I actually...

3869
04:35:33,370 --> 04:35:33,910
Okay, wait.

3870
04:35:35,390 --> 04:35:36,250
Oh, okay.

3871
04:35:36,390 --> 04:35:38,390
It's saying that I can like...

3872
04:35:39,210 --> 04:35:45,790
I can like pause by pressing push and I can skip the movies.

3873
04:35:46,510 --> 04:35:47,370
We're fine, we're fine.

3874
04:35:47,470 --> 04:35:48,630
I don't need, oh, one, okay.

3875
04:35:49,630 --> 04:35:51,570
This is just what to read.

3876
04:35:51,750 --> 04:35:53,830
It says like, while you're waiting, read this or whatever.

3877
04:35:53,970 --> 04:35:57,150
We have one more thing to do until we get the new armor.

3878
04:35:57,610 --> 04:35:59,230
Okay, we're good, we're good, we're good.

3879
04:35:59,490 --> 04:35:59,630
Okay.

3880
04:35:59,970 --> 04:36:01,730
Oh my God, oh my God!

3881
04:36:02,270 --> 04:36:02,970
Oh my God!

3882
04:36:05,710 --> 04:36:07,390
Oh, he's so leafy.

3883
04:36:09,690 --> 04:36:12,270
How do I still have 50 credits?

3884
04:36:13,670 --> 04:36:16,700
Oh my god.

3885
04:36:17,240 --> 04:36:18,740
We're finally at the end fight.

3886
04:36:20,080 --> 04:36:20,660
Oh my gosh.

3887
04:36:23,380 --> 04:36:24,360
It's the end, guys.

3888
04:36:24,520 --> 04:36:25,400
Time to leave.

3889
04:36:30,260 --> 04:36:33,920
Also, I've noticed that there are two more.

3890
04:36:33,960 --> 04:36:36,100
Have you guys seen that there's two more slots?

3891
04:36:37,200 --> 04:36:41,380
I wonder if you can fight the boss and if she's all five.

3892
04:36:42,680 --> 04:36:48,240
I wonder I wonder I wonder Just skip the pain.

3893
04:36:48,400 --> 04:36:55,900
Yeah, that's the that's the funny thing it was I fought the
pain before but like in a Like it just skips around

3894
04:36:55,900 --> 04:37:02,010
sometimes, but the end And the fury I've never done so I'm
thinking

3895
04:37:05,100 --> 04:37:09,540
Oh my god, watch out snake you're just standing there just
as a sitting dog.

3896
04:37:09,760 --> 04:37:13,560
What are we doing there standing man, I'm only Oh, you look
so...

3897
04:37:14,360 --> 04:37:15,880
The bird looks so cute.

3898
04:37:16,300 --> 04:37:17,720
Oh my god, your arm is showing out!

3899
04:37:18,420 --> 04:37:19,600
Snake, don't just stand!

3900
04:37:19,760 --> 04:37:20,460
They're like an idiot!

3901
04:37:21,220 --> 04:37:22,780
This guy's so dumb!

3902
04:37:24,480 --> 04:37:24,720
Ouch!

3903
04:37:25,080 --> 04:37:25,260
Ouch!

3904
04:37:25,580 --> 04:37:25,580
Ouch!

3905
04:37:25,800 --> 04:37:25,800
Ouch!

3906
04:37:26,040 --> 04:37:31,460
I was adjusting and I was like, you know when you're like,
oh, out.

3907
04:37:32,160 --> 04:37:35,860
Like you catch your fingernail and like lift it up.

3908
04:37:36,080 --> 04:37:37,000
Bro is confused.

3909
04:37:37,700 --> 04:37:40,340
He's just... Bro is just as stunned as I am.

3910
04:37:40,460 --> 04:37:42,760
He's just like, I get here?

3911
04:37:43,160 --> 04:37:48,260
He was just like literally an hour ago or two hours ago.

3912
04:37:48,460 --> 04:37:56,220
I was just I was just listening to Sokolov like repeat the
same phrase over and over.

3913
04:37:56,340 --> 04:37:59,400
I was walking through the same forest for two hours.

3914
04:37:59,600 --> 04:38:00,820
How did I get here?

3915
04:38:13,520 --> 04:38:22,540
I don't know how far I want to go with this because I just
noticed the time and I've been streaming a little longer

3916
04:38:22,540 --> 04:38:26,840
than I intended to, which is fine because I'm having so much
fun.

3917
04:38:30,200 --> 04:38:31,480
Snake T posing the end.

3918
04:38:32,520 --> 04:38:33,840
The bottom screen is so cool.

3919
04:38:34,540 --> 04:38:35,360
Also, no more mini-snakes.

3920
04:38:35,500 --> 04:38:36,220
Yeah, you're right!

3921
04:38:36,600 --> 04:38:37,240
He is gone!

3922
04:38:37,440 --> 04:38:40,640
Also, for those who haven't seen, it is one big screen.

3923
04:38:42,120 --> 04:38:45,360
So it just kind of like, in this part, it just kind of like
fades.

3924
04:38:46,000 --> 04:38:47,220
You know, it's just like a fade effect.

3925
04:38:47,340 --> 04:38:50,260
But it's really cool that it's like one big thing.

3926
04:38:54,420 --> 04:38:55,220
Uh-oh.

3927
04:38:56,820 --> 04:38:57,620
Uh-oh.

3928
04:38:58,320 --> 04:38:58,720
Uh-oh.

3929
04:38:58,720 --> 04:38:59,040
Uh-oh.

3930
04:38:59,080 --> 04:39:00,220
Wait, our safety zone!

3931
04:39:00,360 --> 04:39:01,420
Our safety zone!

3932
04:39:06,300 --> 04:39:07,720
Thank you for the suit- Oh, sorry.

3933
04:39:07,920 --> 04:39:08,640
Thank you for the dono.

3934
04:39:11,540 --> 04:39:12,840
Also, do you own the machine?

3935
04:39:12,960 --> 04:39:14,360
I do own this machine, yes.

3936
04:39:14,440 --> 04:39:16,140
This is my own personal machine.

3937
04:39:16,860 --> 04:39:18,940
So I don't have to pay.

3938
04:39:21,980 --> 04:39:35,700
I feel like this fight will take even way longer than Ocelot
so maybe maybe we'll die before I uh before we get to do

3939
04:39:35,700 --> 04:39:42,680
anything um yeah so I don't have to I have like a little
button down here that gives me unlimited uh or not unlimited

3940
04:39:42,680 --> 04:39:50,080
but I can just press it and give me as many credits as I
want as I want so I don't have to spend money on this i

3941
04:39:50,080 --> 04:39:55,680
already spent enough money to to buy it so

3942
04:40:12,420 --> 04:40:18,640
i'm getting really bad luck it's really cool hearing snake
talk so much though

3943
04:40:26,140 --> 04:40:27,260
he's listening

3944
04:40:36,330 --> 04:40:37,370
He's asleep!

3945
04:40:38,430 --> 04:40:38,970
Come on!

3946
04:40:40,350 --> 04:40:40,870
Yes!

3947
04:40:41,230 --> 04:40:41,710
Searching?

3948
04:40:41,710 --> 04:40:42,190
Searching?

3949
04:40:42,270 --> 04:40:43,410
Battle mode searching?

3950
04:40:43,690 --> 04:40:44,870
Oh my god, it's so cool.

3951
04:40:46,230 --> 04:40:48,310
This way, this way.

3952
04:40:52,050 --> 04:40:53,090
Oh no!

3953
04:40:54,430 --> 04:40:56,390
No, no, no, we had it!

3954
04:40:57,430 --> 04:40:58,250
This one's tough.

3955
04:40:59,370 --> 04:41:00,610
But he's not shooting me either.

3956
04:41:00,810 --> 04:41:01,810
But I'm out of the safe zone.

3957
04:41:06,070 --> 04:41:06,870
Uh-oh.

3958
04:41:06,970 --> 04:41:08,110
Uh-oh.

3959
04:41:08,110 --> 04:41:08,230
Uh-oh.

3960
04:41:08,230 --> 04:41:08,930
Thank you for the dono.

3961
04:41:09,050 --> 04:41:13,310
Imagine dropping a save and coming back two weeks later to
see the head defeated, but Apache's lot more?

3962
04:41:13,810 --> 04:41:15,150
I know that'd be crazy, right?

3963
04:41:16,390 --> 04:41:16,930
Uh-oh.

3964
04:41:17,370 --> 04:41:17,970
Uh-oh.

3965
04:41:18,410 --> 04:41:21,650
Oh, Snake, why are you just standing there, you big old
dummy?

3966
04:41:23,110 --> 04:41:24,630
No, Snake, please!

3967
04:41:25,430 --> 04:41:25,910
Uh-oh.

3968
04:41:27,590 --> 04:41:27,990
Oh!

3969
04:41:28,670 --> 04:41:29,470
Oh, God.

3970
04:41:32,730 --> 04:41:33,130
Oh.

3971
04:41:33,130 --> 04:41:33,270
Oh.

3972
04:41:33,370 --> 04:41:33,390
Oh.

3973
04:41:33,390 --> 04:41:33,430
Oh.

3974
04:41:33,930 --> 04:41:34,230
Oh.

3975
04:41:34,250 --> 04:41:37,330
He's so dumb sometimes.

3976
04:41:39,350 --> 04:41:40,190
I don't think...

3977
04:41:40,190 --> 04:41:43,250
Honestly, we might get a save on this, but...

3978
04:41:44,190 --> 04:41:46,690
I feel like we're just gonna end up dying.

3979
04:41:47,090 --> 04:41:51,330
If we die, though, I wonder if it will take us back to the
very beginning?

3980
04:41:51,910 --> 04:41:54,390
Or back to like this area, you know what I mean?

3981
04:41:54,650 --> 04:41:55,190
I wonder.

3982
04:41:55,970 --> 04:41:56,590
I wonder.

3983
04:41:57,590 --> 04:41:58,830
He tanked that.

3984
04:41:58,850 --> 04:41:59,590
Oh, again?

3985
04:41:59,810 --> 04:42:00,330
So soon?

3986
04:42:01,330 --> 04:42:01,690
Oh!

3987
04:42:05,750 --> 04:42:18,790
Hemio Oh my gosh Snake You're not He attacked so soon We
didn't even have a chance Oh Come on Search Search Snake

3988
04:42:18,790 --> 04:42:32,210

does he hit If you roll matches though I don't think there's

3989
04:42:32,210 --> 04:42:34,690
a way to Unless you get like a perk.

3990
04:42:34,850 --> 04:42:35,450
I have no idea.

3991
04:42:36,170 --> 04:42:46,090
I wonder if there's like a very very specific match that
like matchup that you have to get because but it's also

3992
04:42:46,090 --> 04:42:46,730
rigged.

3993
04:42:47,230 --> 04:42:55,370
It's not letting me get anything to avoid it unless it's
this one let's see.

3994
04:42:55,450 --> 04:42:55,870
Never mind.

3995
04:43:08,810 --> 04:43:11,090
Lock on, lock on, lock on.

3996
04:43:12,590 --> 04:43:13,550
Come on, Snake!

3997
04:43:16,990 --> 04:43:17,450
Oh!

3998
04:43:22,350 --> 04:43:23,050
I can't!

3999
04:43:23,170 --> 04:43:23,610
I can't!

4000
04:43:25,230 --> 04:43:25,690
Whoa!

4001
04:43:26,590 --> 04:43:27,590
That does big damage!

4002
04:43:30,130 --> 04:43:30,170
Oh!

4003
04:43:30,890 --> 04:43:31,630
More, more, more!

4004
04:43:31,790 --> 04:43:32,030
More, more!

4005
04:43:35,390 --> 04:43:36,310
Oh!

4006
04:43:38,950 --> 04:43:39,870
Oof.

4007
04:43:41,050 --> 04:43:41,970
Oof.

4008
04:43:42,550 --> 04:43:43,970
Big damage though.

4009
04:43:45,410 --> 04:43:48,330
Uh-oh, is this the end for us?

4010
04:43:48,550 --> 04:43:49,330
Ha, get it?

4011
04:43:49,410 --> 04:43:49,930
The end.

4012
04:43:51,270 --> 04:43:51,790
Is this it?

4013
04:43:53,030 --> 04:43:53,450
Snake.

4014
04:43:57,110 --> 04:43:57,590
Ah!

4015
04:43:59,950 --> 04:44:00,190
Oh!

4016
04:44:01,550 --> 04:44:01,950
Oh!

4017
04:44:02,630 --> 04:44:03,590
You.

4018
04:44:03,910 --> 04:44:04,270
You!

4019
04:44:04,270 --> 04:44:04,410
You!

4020
04:44:04,870 --> 04:44:05,830
You!

4021
04:44:07,950 --> 04:44:08,910
You!

4022
04:44:10,730 --> 04:44:11,690
Slippery!

4023
04:44:12,510 --> 04:44:14,530
You slippery snake, you!

4024
04:44:19,800 --> 04:44:20,680
Good, good.

4025
04:44:26,100 --> 04:44:26,540
Oh,

4026
04:44:32,240 --> 04:44:33,520
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, see the footprints!

4027
04:44:34,340 --> 04:44:38,220
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

4028
04:44:38,240 --> 04:44:40,120
Okay, okay, search, search, search, search, search.

4029
04:44:45,280 --> 04:44:46,160
Oh, no.

4030
04:44:47,140 --> 04:44:48,460
We lost him.

4031
04:44:48,660 --> 04:44:49,040
It's okay.

4032
04:44:49,860 --> 04:44:50,780
ghostly heart.

4033
04:44:51,020 --> 04:45:05,740
I'm my I think my blood pressure right now is kind of insane
because I'm so like like so happy and so like shocked and so

4034
04:45:05,740 --> 04:45:12,860
nervous oh no snake snake

4035
04:45:25,280 --> 04:45:44,450
Okay, here is where we figure out, here is where we learn if
we start over from the very beginning or if the game is a

4036
04:45:44,450 --> 04:45:50,010
little, if the game is a little, uh, what's the word?

4037
04:45:50,590 --> 04:45:52,810
A little kind to us.

4038
04:45:55,930 --> 04:45:58,430
Three week long gambling sequence.

4039
04:46:01,070 --> 04:46:01,810
Oh!

4040
04:46:03,210 --> 04:46:05,010
Jesus, that- and Bogan!

4041
04:46:05,650 --> 04:46:10,290
I didn't even, for some reason, I didn't even consider
fighting him either.

4042
04:46:12,810 --> 04:46:14,410
It did save!

4043
04:46:14,670 --> 04:46:16,190
It did save!

4044
04:46:17,270 --> 04:46:17,730
Yo.

4045
04:46:22,830 --> 04:46:24,670
I think we're back at the beginning.

4046
04:46:26,740 --> 04:46:27,110
Yep.

4047
04:46:28,050 --> 04:46:30,190
We got to get boss time again, I think.

4048
04:46:31,910 --> 04:46:32,850
Okay, are we going to get forked?

4049
04:46:32,890 --> 04:46:34,670
Let's get forked one last time, you guys.

4050
04:46:38,290 --> 04:46:39,090
Get forked!

4051
04:46:39,370 --> 04:46:40,430
Rashed him down.

4052
04:46:45,930 --> 04:46:47,370
Oh, wait, no, no, no.

4053
04:46:47,450 --> 04:46:49,950
I just want to go to him walking around again.

4054
04:46:51,090 --> 04:46:51,890
Okay, there we go.

4055
04:46:53,250 --> 04:46:53,750
All right.

4056
04:46:54,910 --> 04:46:55,710
Alrighty, guys.

4057
04:46:55,850 --> 04:46:58,910
Well, that was an intense run.

4058
04:46:59,130 --> 04:47:00,390
That was kind of insane.

4059
04:47:00,570 --> 04:47:20,170
That was that was a lot that was so much holy cow holy cow I
did I I said that I really wanted to see the end battle and

4060
04:47:20,170 --> 04:47:31,050
I got to and I just wanted to show you guys the theater mode
and I got to I got to show you guys Ocelot battle and I I

4061
04:47:31,050 --> 04:47:35,650
got to show you how cruel it is, and then I got to show you
how we beat it.

4062
04:47:35,710 --> 04:47:36,690
Oh my God.

4063
04:47:45,050 --> 04:47:47,430
That was so intense.

4064
04:47:47,910 --> 04:47:52,290
Secret song too, yes, the song, the original Patchy Slot
song.

4065
04:47:54,050 --> 04:47:56,230
I'm gonna go listen to it after this.

4066
04:47:56,690 --> 04:47:58,750
I'm gonna go listen to it after this.

4067
04:47:58,970 --> 04:48:00,570
Oh, oh.

4068
04:48:01,190 --> 04:48:02,750
Tomorrow is Zumbinis.

4069
04:48:04,610 --> 04:48:05,890
You're a soup.

4070
04:48:06,270 --> 04:48:06,930
Thank you!

4071
04:48:07,250 --> 04:48:13,950
What insane luck for you to be able to beat us a lot, enter
a new area, discover Apache slot exclusive OSD, and face the

4072
04:48:13,950 --> 04:48:15,630
end on your first Apache slot stream.

4073
04:48:15,990 --> 04:48:18,150
This has been so much fun and happy to see you having tons
of fun.

4074
04:48:18,350 --> 04:48:18,850
Thank you, man.

4075
04:48:18,910 --> 04:48:19,450
Thank you!

4076
04:48:20,610 --> 04:48:22,050
Thank you so much.

4077
04:48:24,170 --> 04:48:24,530
Whoa.

4078
04:48:25,650 --> 04:48:26,090
Oh, hold on.

4079
04:48:26,150 --> 04:48:26,870
Let me turn off the echo.

4080
04:48:27,030 --> 04:48:27,190
Sorry.

4081
04:48:27,950 --> 04:48:28,570
There we go.

4082
04:48:34,390 --> 04:48:36,190
I feel so fulfilled right now.

4083
04:48:38,310 --> 04:48:44,050
I can't, how are you supposed to, like, okay, obviously,
obviously, like, it's saved.

4084
04:48:45,490 --> 04:48:55,290
But, how are you supposed to, like, continue and actually
beat it?

4085
04:48:56,530 --> 04:49:00,410
I'm so curious about every inner workings of this machine.

4086
04:49:00,950 --> 04:49:02,990
There's still so much that I don't know.

4087
04:49:03,730 --> 04:49:04,610
It's so fascinating.

4088
04:49:05,010 --> 04:49:05,750
So much fun.

4089
04:49:11,890 --> 04:49:13,330
What a purchase?

4090
04:49:13,750 --> 04:49:15,150
Konami emusement card?

4091
04:49:15,410 --> 04:49:19,310
No, there's nowhere to like tap it.

4092
04:49:20,030 --> 04:49:21,310
Not that I can see.

4093
04:49:22,610 --> 04:49:22,750
Choo!

4094
04:49:23,270 --> 04:49:24,350
What the?

4095
04:49:26,350 --> 04:49:27,970
Pachi Slot was actually so much fun to see.

4096
04:49:28,170 --> 04:49:28,790
Thank you for the stream.

4097
04:49:28,990 --> 04:49:29,290
Welcome back.

4098
04:49:29,430 --> 04:49:30,290
Thank you.

4099
04:49:31,390 --> 04:49:32,530
What's the stream meant?

4100
04:49:32,830 --> 04:49:34,690
Will you be doing it?

4101
04:49:34,730 --> 04:49:35,470
MGS karaoke.

4102
04:49:36,090 --> 04:49:37,750
If so, don't forget to add a new song in.

4103
04:49:38,310 --> 04:49:40,590
like to do an MGS karaoke.

4104
04:49:41,330 --> 04:49:47,970
There's not a ton of songs I can sing, but a while back I
made a mint Minecraft skin.

4105
04:49:48,270 --> 04:49:49,650
Totally not because I wanted to cope.

4106
04:49:51,010 --> 04:49:52,050
Wait, I have a question.

4107
04:49:56,980 --> 04:49:57,760
Is it this one?

4108
04:49:58,380 --> 04:49:59,280
Oh, that's so tiny.

4109
04:50:00,040 --> 04:50:00,740
Is it this one?

4110
04:50:03,140 --> 04:50:05,820
Like a while back, like how long while back?

4111
04:50:06,500 --> 04:50:07,360
This is from

4112
04:50:11,560 --> 04:50:13,120
October 31st, 2020.

4113
04:50:13,480 --> 04:50:14,220
Wow, Halloween.

4114
04:50:17,920 --> 04:50:19,100
It's another one?

4115
04:50:19,280 --> 04:50:19,480
Okay.

4116
04:50:20,420 --> 04:50:21,940
Just posting the tag again here.

4117
04:50:22,540 --> 04:50:23,440
So I can see it.

4118
04:50:26,080 --> 04:50:27,180
I want to play Minecraft.

4119
04:50:28,060 --> 04:50:31,200
But I'm trying to figure out how to.

4120
04:50:34,600 --> 04:50:37,220
Because I want to maybe play.

4121
04:50:37,360 --> 04:50:48,020
in like a Minecraft server with maybe like other wisps but
um well probably membo's like probably you need to be a

4122
04:50:48,020 --> 04:50:58,020
membo to gain access to it but Minecraft doesn't let you um
uh it's part of their like or rather it's against their

4123
04:50:58,020 --> 04:51:07,500
rules to play it like under a paywall so I wouldn't be able
to play Minecraft in members so it's kind of like I don't

4124
04:51:07,500 --> 04:51:08,440
know yet.

4125
04:51:10,180 --> 04:51:12,960
Playing single player, I guess we could always do that too.

4126
04:51:14,720 --> 04:51:17,420
There is, of course, always that.

4127
04:51:19,200 --> 04:51:20,120
Yes, yes, yes.

4128
04:51:24,300 --> 04:51:25,700
Don't we own the server?

4129
04:51:26,000 --> 04:51:26,500
What server?

4130
04:51:27,020 --> 04:51:28,700
The non-existent, there is no server.

4131
04:51:30,060 --> 04:51:32,360
It's completely non-existent.

4132
04:51:33,720 --> 04:51:36,500
I have, I have to, I have to buy Minecraft.

4133
04:51:38,700 --> 04:51:40,840
I have to buy Minecraft, first of all.

4134
04:51:43,540 --> 04:51:45,360
So, I gotta do that first.

4135
04:51:45,720 --> 04:51:46,900
I don't have it yet.

4136
04:51:49,800 --> 04:51:50,160
Yeah, yeah.

4137
04:51:51,520 --> 04:51:52,900
You're a simp.

4138
04:51:53,700 --> 04:51:55,900
Vic Boss, you're pretty good with this patchy slot.

4139
04:51:56,060 --> 04:51:57,160
Thank you!

4140
04:51:58,660 --> 04:52:00,320
Mint love, thank you!

4141
04:52:00,720 --> 04:52:05,300
Generally, I never thought I'd have so much fun watching
someone play patchy slot for five hours.

4142
04:52:05,740 --> 04:52:06,960
Thanks for the stream and welcome back, Mint.

4143
04:52:07,360 --> 04:52:08,620
So much!

4144
04:52:09,280 --> 04:52:10,380
Thank you, thank you.

4145
04:52:10,520 --> 04:52:12,260
Really, really appreciate it.

4146
04:52:13,600 --> 04:52:14,160
Yes, yes.

4147
04:52:17,220 --> 04:52:19,240
A server without a nation.

4148
04:52:22,040 --> 04:52:23,820
Lots of people have Patreon servers.

4149
04:52:24,760 --> 04:52:24,900
Yeah.

4150
04:52:25,280 --> 04:52:26,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4151
04:52:26,940 --> 04:52:31,280
I don't know if Matara would be interested in doing a
Patreon one.

4152
04:52:33,840 --> 04:52:37,340
Because, first of all, the Patreon will only be for...

4153
04:52:37,360 --> 04:52:49,280
the podcast length so once the podcast is up you're a kind
of dead server that wouldn't be so good and so if I am

4154
04:52:49,280 --> 04:53:02,280
staying longer after the the podcast of course it would be
good to have something that I control skin posted on the tag

4155
04:53:02,280 --> 04:53:10,720
thanks for the skin tag I'll see you played with the Ryusei
Nova in a whore.

4156
04:53:10,960 --> 04:53:11,880
That is true.

4157
04:53:12,720 --> 04:53:13,600
That is true.

4158
04:53:14,520 --> 04:53:15,900
I did play once.

4159
04:53:16,240 --> 04:53:17,920
Wait, then do I own it?

4160
04:53:20,540 --> 04:53:21,180
Wait!

4161
04:53:23,320 --> 04:53:24,900
Do I own Minecraft?

4162
04:53:26,440 --> 04:53:27,540
That's so true.

4163
04:53:27,740 --> 04:53:29,040
I did...

4164
04:53:32,920 --> 04:53:34,460
I might have Minecraft.

4165
04:53:35,120 --> 04:53:36,280
I actually...

4166
04:53:36,280 --> 04:53:36,680
Okay.

4167
04:53:36,700 --> 04:53:38,700
Okay, I vaguely remember...

4168
04:53:39,420 --> 04:53:40,980
Wait, uh-oh, I might be in trouble though.

4169
04:53:41,140 --> 04:53:42,880
I vaguely remember...

4170
04:53:42,880 --> 04:53:45,360
Okay, this is all coming back to me right now at this very
moment.

4171
04:53:46,280 --> 04:53:47,700
I kept getting emails...

4172
04:53:48,740 --> 04:53:54,620
In my mint email being like, Hey, don't forget to migrate
your Minecraft over to Microsoft account.

4173
04:53:55,100 --> 04:53:59,340
And I was like, I'll do that later.

4174
04:54:00,580 --> 04:54:01,060
I...

4175
04:54:01,620 --> 04:54:02,100
I...

4176
04:54:02,100 --> 04:54:03,740
I never did it.

4177
04:54:05,880 --> 04:54:06,360
So...

4178
04:54:06,700 --> 04:54:07,540
It's gone now?

4179
04:54:07,720 --> 04:54:08,700
Wait, but...

4180
04:54:09,240 --> 04:54:10,320
But I bought it.

4181
04:54:10,600 --> 04:54:11,280
So...

4182
04:54:11,280 --> 04:54:12,740
If I just remake the account...

4183
04:54:13,740 --> 04:54:14,100
Wait.

4184
04:54:17,660 --> 04:54:20,560
Wait, so I have to buy Minecraft a third time?

4185
04:54:27,420 --> 04:54:28,620
No way.

4186
04:54:32,240 --> 04:54:33,580
No way.

4187
04:54:35,860 --> 04:54:36,540
Okay.

4188
04:54:38,420 --> 04:54:39,840
Okay, I'll buy it.

4189
04:54:44,660 --> 04:54:47,240
I swear so many people own Minecraft multiple times.

4190
04:54:48,780 --> 04:54:49,200
Why?

4191
04:54:49,600 --> 04:54:50,760
I bought it, though.

4192
04:54:50,920 --> 04:54:52,240
I mean, I guess it is my fault.

4193
04:54:52,480 --> 04:54:53,320
They did warn me.

4194
04:54:53,480 --> 04:54:55,560
They did send me a lot of emails.

4195
04:54:58,760 --> 04:54:59,140
Minecraft.

4196
04:54:59,380 --> 04:55:00,220
No, Takis!

4197
04:55:00,480 --> 04:55:00,860
Oh, no.

4198
04:55:01,640 --> 04:55:02,140
Stop!

4199
04:55:03,820 --> 04:55:05,360
No Minecraft funds.

4200
04:55:16,140 --> 04:55:17,060
Thank you.

4201
04:55:17,600 --> 04:55:20,420
Number servers are fairly common and it would be pretty
cool, I think.

4202
04:55:20,580 --> 04:55:20,740
Haha.

4203
04:55:21,240 --> 04:55:22,840
Not that I like Minecraft or anything.

4204
04:55:23,380 --> 04:55:25,540
You forgot to add an extra haha at the end of that.

4205
04:55:26,040 --> 04:55:27,400
Not that I like Minecraft or anything.

4206
04:55:27,780 --> 04:55:27,820
Haha.

4207
04:55:32,300 --> 04:55:36,620
I feel like by now, probably someone took Mint Phantom.

4208
04:55:36,700 --> 04:55:47,440
so what am i i have to come up with a new username i have to
come up with a new username we'll think of something we'd

4209
04:55:47,440 --> 04:55:57,740
love a member server yeah maybe we can do that member server
but i would play um not on members obviously but normal

4210
04:56:08,120 --> 04:56:16,960
mint phantom fps vtuber reel that sounds like a That sounds
like a name that someone who shits themselves would take,

4211
04:56:17,040 --> 04:56:17,410
you know?

4212
04:56:24,990 --> 04:56:27,050
I don't want that kind of image.

4213
04:56:30,170 --> 04:56:30,630
True.

4214
04:56:38,250 --> 04:56:40,370
Anyway, I had a lot of fun today.

4215
04:56:40,530 --> 04:56:41,470
I hope you guys did too.

4216
04:56:41,970 --> 04:56:42,710
Thank you so much.

4217
04:56:42,870 --> 04:56:43,990
I'm sorry that...

4218
04:56:44,070 --> 04:56:57,770
It took five hours to get to the really exciting bits, but I
had so much fun and I hear seething in the universe.

4219
04:56:58,010 --> 04:56:58,230
Do you?

4220
04:56:58,850 --> 04:56:59,990
I'm unbothered.

4221
04:57:04,110 --> 04:57:04,990
Couldn't be me.

4222
04:57:12,190 --> 04:57:14,050
Oh, but yeah, I had so much fun.

4223
04:57:14,070 --> 04:57:19,750
fun um thank you guys for watching and uh see you tomorrow
for zoom bini

4224
04:57:23,850 --> 04:57:34,850
okay you know actually i realized this um yesterday or not
yesterday well yes yesterday but like after um the karaoke

4225
04:57:34,850 --> 04:57:40,510
stream i think because i went from karaoke or from singing
the last song to ending it like you know i used to end my

4226
04:57:40,510 --> 04:57:53,890
streams with playing boston So, but I'm kind of also afraid
of the content, whatever police con, you know, especially

4227
04:57:53,890 --> 04:57:57,550
because I still have a strike on my account.

4228
04:57:58,550 --> 04:58:01,890
But I think maybe, maybe I can do it.

4229
04:58:02,010 --> 04:58:02,330
I don't know.

4230
04:58:02,390 --> 04:58:05,490
I'm kind of afraid of the, yeah, the content ID.

4231
04:58:06,910 --> 04:58:10,830
Because actually my, my bust in cover is even.

4232
04:58:14,070 --> 04:58:22,410
have a strike but it is partially blocked according to it i
don't even know where where is it partially blocked let's

4233
04:58:22,410 --> 04:58:29,740
see where are you blocked

4234
04:58:44,240 --> 04:58:54,200
oh it's been partially blocked in some countries and their
regions yeah but where it doesn't tell me where I have no

4235
04:58:54,200 --> 04:58:54,620
idea.

4236
04:58:56,120 --> 04:58:57,160
Oh well.

4237
04:58:59,040 --> 04:59:00,360
How old of a block?

4238
04:59:00,660 --> 04:59:01,840
Long, long time ago.

4239
04:59:02,700 --> 04:59:12,060
And I never got, I never got like, even in the past when I,
when I would play Bustin, I never got like content ID'd.

4240
04:59:12,140 --> 04:59:19,500
But I feel like maybe YouTube's stuff has changed a little
bit in the past three years.

4241
04:59:20,260 --> 04:59:23,700
I think you're good as long as you don't watch another, We
say video.

4242
04:59:25,980 --> 04:59:26,500
Oh my gosh.

4243
04:59:26,900 --> 04:59:32,100
We talked about that, Matara and I in the latest Patreon, in
the next Patreon episode.

4244
04:59:35,940 --> 04:59:40,520
We looked up some of those spy animals and how terrifying
they are.

4245
04:59:41,640 --> 04:59:42,620
Just singing Acapella.

4246
04:59:43,660 --> 04:59:43,920
Okay.

4247
04:59:48,420 --> 04:59:49,440
I wonder.

4248
04:59:50,380 --> 04:59:51,740
I wonder.

4249
04:59:52,060 --> 04:59:52,480
Okay.

4250
04:59:52,500 --> 04:59:54,780
Wait, do I still have my instrumental of it?

4251
04:59:56,680 --> 04:59:58,040
Maybe somewhere, right?

4252
05:00:00,700 --> 05:00:01,820
Maybe somewhere.

4253
05:00:04,740 --> 05:00:05,680
Oh, wait.

4254
05:00:08,560 --> 05:00:10,120
This is the mix.

4255
05:00:16,100 --> 05:00:17,860
Oh, I do still have it.

4256
05:00:23,490 --> 05:00:24,230
I'll just say.

4257
05:00:24,250 --> 05:00:25,290
Sing it myself!

4258
05:00:29,250 --> 05:00:30,850
Can you hear it?

4259
05:00:31,670 --> 05:00:32,470
Oh, it's kind of quiet.

4260
05:00:32,850 --> 05:00:33,090
Definitely.

4261
05:00:35,190 --> 05:00:36,610
Why is it in one ear?

4262
05:00:38,950 --> 05:00:40,950
It's like so in one ear.

4263
05:00:43,510 --> 05:00:44,130
It's like so in one ear.

4264
05:00:47,830 --> 05:00:51,990
