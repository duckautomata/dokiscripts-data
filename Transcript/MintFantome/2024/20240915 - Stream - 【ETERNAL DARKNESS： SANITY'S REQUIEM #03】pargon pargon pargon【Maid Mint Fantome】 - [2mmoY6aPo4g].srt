1
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,470
I'm not gonna lie, I almost forgot I was streaming for a second.

2
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:11,030
I'm not gonna lie, I just thought I could do this for the whole time.

3
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:21,590
Hello and welcome back after so long to Eternal Darkness!

4
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,130
Oh my goodness, sorry.

5
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,290
I am extra sleepy today.

6
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,290
Mega sleepy.

7
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,230
I was planning on going a long time.

8
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,870
If I wake up, I will go a long time.

9
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,570
If I don't wake up, I'll just go for a medium time.

10
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,950
This isn't part one?

11
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,510
No.

12
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,660
Audio's loud?

13
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,160
I can't tell which one you hear.

14
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,300
Shouldn't be that loud.

15
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,900
Maybe I'm just quiet.

16
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
It's very loud!

17
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,040
It's showing up not even that loud on my side.

18
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,780
What the heck?

19
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,200
I'm quiet?

20
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,380
Is that...

21
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,080
Is that less quiet or less loud?

22
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,780
I'm doing experiments right now.

23
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,500
Wait, is it actually?

24
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,240
I think you guys hear double audio.

25
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,260
What about this?

26
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,430
So weird!

27
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,750
Okay, so like now it's quiet.

28
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,370
So that should be better.

29
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,070
I'm still learning.

30
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,670
This is why I play the OBS.

31
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,610
Instead of using a separate monitor.

32
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,450
Because I can control things better.

33
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,590
Because I can control things better.

34
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,210
Being lovely as always.

35
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:28,770
Thank you!

36
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,110
Hello Minto!

37
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,470
Thank you for streaming at this time.

38
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,170
Thank you for being here at this time!

39
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:34,990
Thank you!

40
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,110
Okay, so that should be better.

41
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,670
Anyway, thank you guys.

42
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,250
Let's ignore that.

43
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,190
It's been a long time since I last played Eternal Darkness.

44
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,610
Like a long time.

45
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,430
Like...

46
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,970
A month at least.

47
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,290
And this game is already pretty wacky.

48
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,330
So I'm quite worried that I've forgotten how to play.

49
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,710
But also...

50
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,570
I can't remember where we left off.

51
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,270
You still play through OBS?

52
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:16,710
No!

53
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,450
That's...

54
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,470
Comprehens...

55
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,370
Listening comprehension!

56
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,630
I said this is why I like to play through OBS instead of a separate monitor.

57
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,270
Because I can control the audio better.

58
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,250
But because I'm playing through a monitor...

59
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,670
I can't control the audio as well!

60
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,910
Gosh!

61
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,170
I'm not playing through OBS!

62
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,650
Indiana Jones stage.

63
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,110
That's right!

64
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:44,910
Oh my gosh!

65
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,250
That's right!

66
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,850
There was that guy that tried to kill me!

67
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,710
And then...

68
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,970
We ended.

69
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,330
Yes!

70
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:51,950
I remember!

71
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,030
You're...

72
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,310
You are Indiana Jones.

73
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:55,830
Yes!

74
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,230
Yes!

75
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:56,530
Yes!

76
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:56,770
Yes!

77
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:56,910
Yes!

78
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,350
I remember!

79
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:57,830
I remember!

80
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,130
I remember!

81
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,050
That guy tried to kill us!

82
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,170
Yes!

83
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:01,430
Yes!

84
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:01,710
Yes!

85
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,930
So you're playing through OBS...

86
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,250
STOP!

87
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,430
Stop it!

88
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:12,970
Stop!

89
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,630
I'm not playing through OBS!

90
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,070
This game belongs in a museum!

91
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:21,990
Oh my gosh!

92
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,950
Ever since I saw...

93
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,550
I went to the zoo in Japan.

94
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,190
And I saw like...

95
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:28,290
Thank you!

96
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,870
Thank you!

97
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,330
Thank you!

98
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,610
I saw like a regular goose.

99
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,870
You know, like a Canadian goose.

100
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,850
I saw it in the zoo.

101
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,630
And I was like, wow!

102
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,670
I see these like...

103
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,450
You know...

104
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,610
Just around town.

105
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,130
And so I was like...

106
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,530
Ever since...

107
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,090
Ever since I saw him...

108
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,010
I was like...

109
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,370
I was making fun of him in the zoo.

110
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,930
I was like, you belong in a museum.

111
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,570
And now I've been saying it for everything.

112
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,430
I'll see something and I'll be like, it belongs in a museum!

113
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:03,230
It's like my catchphrase right now.

114
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,070
Yippee!

115
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,470
A more EU compatible stream!

116
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,570
I just finished Milking Farm, the Minotaur story.

117
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,270
It was interesting, but it wasn't for me.

118
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,470
I kept going because I kept imagining Mint being like...

119
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,410
The whole time I was laughing so much though.

120
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,730
Actually, Matara and I talked about that in the last episode even.

121
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,130
I go into more detail.

122
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,850
It was so long ago.

123
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,690
I can't remember so much of it.

124
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,510
Minto, you look cuter today.

125
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,650
Maybe it's my brain at 1am.

126
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,230
Go to sleep!

127
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,490
That should be me.

128
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,070
I should be asleep right now.

129
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,570
I'm so tired.

130
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,110
I'm so tired!

131
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,510
But that's okay.

132
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,810
Hopefully this game... Hopefully my sanity is restored.

133
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,190
With this.

134
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,690
So yes, we're Dr. Edwin Lindsey.

135
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,630
And we're in 1983 AD.

136
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,710
And we are basically Indiana Jones.

137
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,410
Basically.

138
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:04,970
I think.

139
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:12,870
So let's... I'm going to have to relearn how to do the combat.

140
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,050
But I have confidence.

141
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,910
Are you sure you want to load this game?

142
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,170
Yeah.

143
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,210
Here we go!

144
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,530
The darkness comes.

145
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,870
Oh my gosh.

146
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,670
Paragon, paragon, paragon.

147
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,410
Paragon, paragon, paragon.

148
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,130
There's a big secret in this chapter?

149
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,350
What do you mean by that?

150
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,650
Also, I can't hear it now.

151
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,910
It's so low.

152
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,130
I think maybe just the ambience in that other one was...

153
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,590
Okay.

154
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,610
Maybe that's better.

155
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,590
Sanity riz-stored.

156
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,410
Don't say that.

157
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:57,990
Alright, let's see.

158
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:58,450
Okay.

159
00:10:59,330 --> 00:10:59,990
Oh gosh.

160
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,050
Using a...

161
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,550
Okay, we have a gun!

162
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,910
But we have shotgun shells, but no shotgun.

163
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,150
We have pistol ammo.

164
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,310
We are holding a pistol.

165
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,630
We do have a shotgun!

166
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,310
I'm a liar.

167
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,130
Equip with a shotgun.

168
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,770
And we have a knife.

169
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,850
We have our archaeologist brush.

170
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,330
We've got a torch.

171
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,650
Nice.

172
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,810
Sounds like double audio.

173
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,350
See?

174
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,710
I think there really is double audio.

175
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,830
Wait, so... hold on.

176
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,970
Experiment again.

177
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,250
If I do this, can you hear it?

178
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,330
Can you hear the audio if I... I'm so confused.

179
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,430
You can hear it.

180
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,270
See?

181
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,450
Oh my gosh.

182
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,190
I knew it this whole time.

183
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,150
But then why during Metal Gear you guys couldn't hear it?

184
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,250
I have no idea.

185
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,750
Everything is so confused for me.

186
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,690
Everything is... this whole setup is so confusing for me.

187
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,700
Just a thing with this game?

188
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,520
I don't think so.

189
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,420
But you can still hear it right now, right?

190
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,480
Too busy to watch.

191
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,960
So vodking.

192
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,500
Thanks for... dropping by though.

193
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,320
Thanks for the super chat!

194
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,720
Try...

195
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,020
Oh!

196
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,520
Oh!

197
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:46,700
Ah!

198
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,440
Shut up!

199
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,460
It's kind of loud.

200
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,980
I'm so confused.

201
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,900
How do I get to my... magic?

202
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,600
So we got a shotgun.

203
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,780
That's how I aim.

204
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,560
I hope I don't die.

205
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,430
Examine.

206
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,150
Nice.

207
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,590
Let's just leave.

208
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,090
Can I run?

209
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:21,570
Oh gosh.

210
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,230
How do I run again?

211
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:22,810
Oh my gosh.

212
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,450
How do I do everything?

213
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,550
Lindsay cannot cast spells without the Tome of Eternal Darkness.

214
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:28,650
Oh.

215
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,770
This is how I sneak?

216
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,530
This is how...

217
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:31,750
Ah!

218
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,250
That's how I shoot?

219
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,750
Oh my gosh.

220
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,850
Scared the heck out of me.

221
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:41,810
Oh gosh.

222
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:42,610
Okay.

223
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,830
Maybe there's like a... hold on.

224
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:49,530
Controller.

225
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,150
Okay.

226
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:50,530
Here we go.

227
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,360
Okay.

228
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,520
Okay.

229
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,580
Tome of Tidal Drop.

230
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,680
Okay.

231
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,180
Here we go.

232
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,200
L is to run.

233
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,400
Move character.

234
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,500
Access book.

235
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:08,660
Sneak.

236
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,480
Quick spell.

237
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,760
Attack.

238
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,200
To target an enemy.

239
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:14,460
Okay.

240
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,080
That's what I was doing.

241
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,040
I was holding the R button.

242
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,840
And then release to hold.

243
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,180
Okay.

244
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,000
All right.

245
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,960
Quick spell two through five.

246
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,600
Oh yeah.

247
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,060
That's right.

248
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,440
That's right.

249
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,480
Actually try to leave.

250
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:24,860
It's funny.

251
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,340
Okay.

252
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:25,840
Let's try.

253
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,820
Run.

254
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,140
Lindsay has no intention of leaving the temple yet.

255
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,120
He is determined to get to the artifact before Augustine does.

256
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,340
No one ever crosses Edwin Lindsay.

257
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:43,800
Yeah.

258
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,400
Screw that guy.

259
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,480
So we...

260
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:50,860
Yeah.

261
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,820
That guy literally tried to kill us.

262
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,420
And so we're gonna kick his butt.

263
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,660
I remember this so much.

264
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,260
Statue of a seated goddess.

265
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,740
A bronze bracelet is worn on her wrist.

266
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,200
But where her neck should bear jewelry, there are only worn grooves and flecks of bronze dust.

267
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,940
Sounds so pompous.

268
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,640
I mean, wouldn't you be?

269
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,100
This guy is Edwiana Jones.

270
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:22,920
Okay.

271
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,980
I think there's only that one way we can go.

272
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,740
Ooh.

273
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,980
I'm tired.

274
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,840
My stamina.

275
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,220
All right.

276
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,520
Let's go.

277
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,160
He has such a power walk.

278
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,380
I'm nervous though.

279
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,360
Oh no.

280
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,300
Oh.

281
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,620
Time to get a tome, everybody.

282
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:44,940
Oh.

283
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,820
Step on your faces.

284
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
Step on you.

285
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,960
Step on you.

286
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,500
Step on you.

287
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,760
Elia.

288
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,300
Oh.

289
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,200
I don't even do that.

290
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,800
Who are you?

291
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,480
Pius Augustus.

292
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,500
Oh no.

293
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,020
Pius.

294
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,860
It's all the people that had the book.

295
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,560
The tome.

296
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,420
Karim.

297
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,160
Yes.

298
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,600
I've never even met him.

299
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,260
I've never even noticed this before.

300
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,020
Anthony.

301
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,040
Yeah.

302
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,640
This guy was our simp.

303
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,740
This guy was our simp.

304
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,580
Look it.

305
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,300
He's just like staring at the people on the ground.

306
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,900
He's like, you good?

307
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,040
Oh my gosh.

308
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,400
Here's best character over here.

309
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,100
Yeah.

310
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:31,980
Roivas.

311
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,540
Yeah.

312
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,260
All my homies love Roivas.

313
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,420
It's a little loud.

314
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,580
I don't know.

315
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,260
It's a little...

316
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,140
Can you hear me?

317
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,880
Can you guys shut up for two seconds?

318
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,480
Cradled in what appears to be a leathery hand lies a mysterious book.

319
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,260
Shh.

320
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:51,980
Shh.

321
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,820
It is bound in human skin.

322
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,700
And intricately decorated with shrunken bones.

323
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It beckons in yours to be possessed.

324
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,740
But doesn't claim it.

325
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,260
Yes.

326
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,000
Shut up.

327
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:14,850
Wow.

328
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,410
Oh my gosh.

329
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,110
Oh my gosh.

330
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:18,330
Oh my gosh.

331
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,550
So now we have our Tome of Eternal Darkness.

332
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,330
We're going to check this thing.

333
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:27,250
This is the Tome of Eternal Darkness, where experience, spells, and enchanted items can be stored.

334
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,270
Yes.

335
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,570
Yes.

336
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,990
Yes.

337
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,290
Spell list.

338
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:31,750
Okay.

339
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,770
We have, we have enchant an item, recover, reveal invisible.

340
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,030
This is how we sound when you're five seconds late.

341
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:43,970
I believe it.

342
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,110
If you're a weapon that the devs need.

343
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,150
There's mad descriptions for all the weapons.

344
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:51,910
Pretty detailed.

345
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,970
Wait, like...

346
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,750
Oh, wait.

347
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,070
Hold on.

348
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:58,930
I want to see.

349
00:17:59,090 --> 00:17:59,350
Wait.

350
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,110
Check.

351
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,330
Since 1907, this weapon has been a trusted sidearm to U.S.

352
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:07,850
armed forces.

353
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:18,090
Through two world wars, Korea and Vietnam, the Colt M1911 automatic pistol has proven itself to be a reliable firearm with good quality.

354
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,930
And stopping power.

355
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:20,970
Nice.

356
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:31,710
The unusual L-shape of the Kukri gives the weapon a significant advantage in close quarters.

357
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,410
Close quarters combat.

358
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:43,250
The combination of a cutting edge on the inside curve of the blade and heavy weight of the blade tip gives the Kukri immense chopping power.

359
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,930
The Kukri?

360
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,290
Kukri?

361
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,910
The L weapon.

362
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,710
Um, yeah, L.

363
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:54,850
Okay.

364
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,770
I'm sorry.

365
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,350
I know I'm going to keep checking things.

366
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,310
I just want to make sure I know what I'm doing.

367
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,190
Quick spell number one.

368
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,050
And quick spell...

369
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,250
Okay.

370
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:05,650
Y.

371
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,590
Sneak.

372
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,430
Attack.

373
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,090
Reload is Z.

374
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:11,810
Okay.

375
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,870
And then to target is R.

376
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:16,970
Release and hold.

377
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,170
Yeah.

378
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:18,350
Yeah.

379
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:18,550
Yeah.

380
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:18,730
Okay.

381
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:23,730
Okay.

382
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,870
Okay.

383
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,250
I'm scared!

384
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,250
Sorry my voice is also a little rasper today.

385
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,230
Okay.

386
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,490
Here I go.

387
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:35,910
Ah!

388
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:36,990
Ah!

389
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,410
Here I go!

390
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,070
Here I leave!

391
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,910
They didn't even give me a seconds notice.

392
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:48,610
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,050
Without just being like, by the way, there's demons in here.

394
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,830
What's my spell number one?

395
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:54,250
Hold on.

396
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,710
Spell... oh wait, quick spell.

397
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,590
Oh, I don't have one on why.

398
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,750
Enchant item, recover...

399
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,910
So there is recover sanity.

400
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,390
Which is the bottom one.

401
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,070
Recover health is the left one.

402
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,590
And then recover magic is the...

403
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,290
right one.

404
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,770
Okay, okay, it's all coming back to me.

405
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,550
I believe.

406
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,590
I believe, I believe, I believe.

407
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,750
Spend magic to recover magic.

408
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,370
Yeah, pretty much.

409
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,290
Recover magic is useless though.

410
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,430
Yeah, probably won't use that one.

411
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,570
But, I want to enchant my gun.

412
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,590
Can I enchant my gun?

413
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:48,770
Can I enchant my gun?

414
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,290
Yippee!

415
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,310
Wasn't there...

416
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,210
Though, wasn't there ways to like enchant different colors?

417
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,170
Depending on the guy.

418
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,890
Actually, now I think about it.

419
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,170
Hold on.

420
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,710
No, not check.

421
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,170
Well, yeah.

422
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,410
No, hold on.

423
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,330
Yeah, there was.

424
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:20,850
Wasn't there?

425
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:23,910
Yes!

426
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,310
Oh my gosh, but I only have the one!

427
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,270
I only have the one as a quick spell.

428
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,370
I think those guys just glowed green.

429
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,070
I think those guys just glowed green when I walked in.

430
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,970
Enchant gun equals magic missile.

431
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:39,890
Yeah!

432
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,750
And so, I'm gonna redo it.

433
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,910
Wait, so green beats...

434
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,010
Wait, is it green beats green?

435
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,510
Or is it...

436
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,130
Wait, red?

437
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,530
I should be red?

438
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,570
Okay, gotta use the weakness.

439
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:00,910
Okay.

440
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:01,890
Sorry.

441
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,010
It's all coming back to me.

442
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,270
Slowly.

443
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,530
But surely.

444
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:07,750
Okay.

445
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,610
So, Pokemon.

446
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,530
It's Pokemon.

447
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,090
Sorry, my mind was...

448
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,110
My mind was blue archive.

449
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,970
My mind was blue archive, not Pokemon.

450
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:19,390
Okay.

451
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,030
We're good.

452
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:20,430
We're good.

453
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,130
Okay.

454
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,010
Let's go.

455
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,150
Oh my God!

456
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,590
Finish him!

457
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,610
I think I'm insane.

458
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:45,770
Insane?

459
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,410
Then... Yes, that does use ammo.

460
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,130
Oh, I think my head was blocking it.

461
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,670
But to finish them, it does use ammo.

462
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,130
So, we're gonna have to be careful.

463
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,190
What was reload again?

464
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,050
Reload is Z.

465
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,010
All right.

466
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,010
Seven shots.

467
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,530
We're examining.

468
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,290
Um...

469
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:17,630
Oh.

470
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:18,970
Uh...

471
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,170
Sun...

472
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,350
Hi.

473
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,170
Oh.

474
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,130
This carving represents the growth of the human race.

475
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,610
My bad magic boomstick.

476
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,130
It's rise to intelligence and the development of society.

477
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,570
It foreshadows the decline of humanity.

478
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,630
This is humanity's dusk.

479
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,050
Okay.

480
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,370
Okey-dokey.

481
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,050
Anything over here?

482
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,450
I'm just staring at that guy.

483
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,570
I'm like, don't wake up.

484
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:52,950
Don't get up.

485
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,730
Don't wake up.

486
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:54,970
Don't get up.

487
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,470
Don't wake up.

488
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,330
Don't get up.

489
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:56,810
Don't wake up.

490
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,630
What is that?

491
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,090
Oh.

492
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:02,970
I've...

493
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,290
Oh.

494
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,630
It's these things.

495
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:05,570
Oh.

496
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,050
Oh.

497
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:06,470
I...

498
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:07,330
Oh!

499
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,250
Let's go!

500
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,600
Okay.

501
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:13,880
Easy.

502
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:15,820
Ah!

503
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:16,700
Oh my gosh.

504
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,180
Okay.

505
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,700
Maybe I just run through this.

506
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,240
Ha!

507
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,300
But those things...

508
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,860
I sneak past them, I think.

509
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:39,900
Oh gosh.

510
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,880
I keep clicking stuff.

511
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,920
I keep clicking stuff.

512
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,560
I keep clicking stuff.

513
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,540
I don't know what I'm clicking.

514
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,260
Don't walk on that.

515
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,400
Don't do it.

516
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,020
Ah!

517
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:49,900
I just walked on it.

518
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,940
We're probably okay.

519
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,880
Where does this go?

520
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,240
No where?

521
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:55,780
Okay.

522
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,500
What about here?

523
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,460
Oh!

524
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,540
Displayed upon the pedestal is a metal bracelet.

525
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,440
Oh...

526
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,980
I got a metal bracelet.

527
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,220
Let's see.

528
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,220
I clicked on something else!

529
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:18,820
Oh my gosh.

530
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,380
I'm really bad at this.

531
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,440
Don't click on those.

532
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,380
Yeah, yeah, nice, nice.

533
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,060
Wait, is this a... no.

534
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,980
Okay, that's a wall.

535
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,460
Examine.

536
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,960
A spiderweb.

537
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:44,100
The corner is shrouded with dense cobwebs, casting it into shadow, perhaps even hiding something.

538
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,380
I have... a torch!

539
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,200
Yes!

540
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,260
Okay.

541
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,950
What is it hiding?

542
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,620
Oh, the brush!

543
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,220
I'm an archaeologist, everybody.

544
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,060
Oh my gosh!

545
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,220
What the hell?

546
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,700
How could that be revealed that my torch could not show?

547
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,820
Excuse me!

548
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,200
Oh no, minus one.

549
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,360
My joke wasn't funny.

550
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,680
Hidden behind the strings of cobwebs is a carved stone tablet.

551
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,500
I got a magical codex!

552
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,940
Okay, attach my gun.

553
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,600
Where's my gun?

554
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,400
Maybe I want... actually...

555
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,720
Can't the torch though... isn't the torch kind of OP?

556
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,760
Like, can't I just burn these guys?

557
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,860
Isn't it kind of awesome?

558
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,960
Maybe I should use this instead, not waste my bullets.

559
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:04,900
Oh!

560
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,140
Ah!

561
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,100
Oh!

562
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
Oh, maybe I should have my bullets.

563
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,140
Let's...

564
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,710
And it was green, so maybe I...

565
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,130
And cast...

566
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,030
I cast...

567
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,590
Enchant item!

568
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,530
Friend-shaped?

569
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,430
I don't know about that.

570
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,710
It's now enchanted!

571
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:45,810
Okay.

572
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,710
Let's go.

573
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,510
What do you mean you have a barrier?

574
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,430
What is this?

575
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,410
He's leaving me alone though.

576
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,450
Maybe I just...

577
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,030
A bronze necklace.

578
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,350
Just gonna take that.

579
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,740
Kinda cool.

580
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,560
Oh sorry, I know you guys are like blocking most of him.

581
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,400
And so me too.

582
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,280
I like just...

583
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,980
Oh, there's another necklace!

584
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,900
Behind him.

585
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,540
There you go.

586
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,700
I think I need that though.

587
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,700
He's trapped.

588
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,700
Do I have a spell?

589
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,380
I don't know why I would want to release him, but...

590
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,560
Reveal it...

591
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,400
That...

592
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,700
He belongs in a zoo.

593
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,320
He belongs in a museum.

594
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:02,440
Where's him?

595
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,240
If I go...

596
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,160
If I go over here...

597
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,500
What if I like...

598
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,580
Kind of walk into his aura?

599
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,820
I'm scared.

600
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,120
It's kind of nice being able to see him like so close like this, you know?

601
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,980
He's kind of a mouth breather, but that's okay.

602
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,700
Be brave.

603
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,100
Okay.

604
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,760
Ow!

605
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,640
Oh!

606
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,120
Oh!

607
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,540
Okay.

608
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,100
Okay.

609
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,480
I got it.

610
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:40,900
I got it.

611
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,680
Okay.

612
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:41,900
Okay.

613
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,460
Um...

614
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,660
Maybe I have to go back then.

615
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,000
Maybe I do put it on the...

616
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,560
Oh my gosh.

617
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,040
Be careful.

618
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,180
Please, sir.

619
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,480
I wish I could see for...

620
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,160
Forward.

621
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,740
I wish I could see forward.

622
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,940
I wish I could see in front of me if there's any of those crit...

623
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,580
Little critters.

624
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:00,840
You know?

625
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,900
I can't even hug him.

626
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,300
It's fine.

627
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,640
He probably...

628
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,160
Doesn't...

629
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,900
Would prefer...

630
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,880
Rather not to.

631
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,660
You know?

632
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,440
I don't think I can avoid this one.

633
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,240
Um...

634
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,980
Okay.

635
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,460
Okay, Indy.

636
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,300
Big step.

637
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,040
Big step now, okay?

638
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,480
Big...

639
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,440
Big...

640
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,520
Big...

641
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,740
One big...

642
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,420
Well, you could see it right there.

643
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:29,860
Oh!

644
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,220
Oh my gosh.

645
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,220
What's up?

646
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:32,960
Hold on.

647
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,060
I'm gonna equip the torch real quick.

648
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,380
Yeah, yeah.

649
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:38,940
There we go.

650
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,160
Okay.

651
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,140
All right, Indy.

652
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:40,860
Okay.

653
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,380
I don't remember.

654
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:41,880
What's his...

655
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,120
Edwin.

656
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,380
All right, Edwin.

657
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,580
Okay!

658
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,400
Professional.

659
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,920
Don't wake up.

660
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:50,720
Oh, bye.

661
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,160
We're gonna go put that necklace on.

662
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,340
See if it does anything.

663
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,500
I think it's gonna open one of these doors, right?

664
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:06,590
Yes!

665
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,270
Oh!

666
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:09,890
Oh!

667
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:10,430
Oh!

668
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,050
Oh!

669
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,870
Oh!

670
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,030
We can go one of two ways.

671
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:21,990
We can go...

672
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,890
Which way should we go?

673
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,390
We can go to this area.

674
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,230
How mysterious.

675
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,830
Or we can go back to our friend.

676
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:31,910
Let's see.

677
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,710
I know there's gonna be guys right here.

678
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:35,030
Oh.

679
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,750
Ah!

680
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,470
Examine.

681
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,970
This particular depiction represents the birth of the human race within the universe.

682
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,070
This is humanity.

683
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,770
Humanity is dawn.

684
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:57,970
Okay.

685
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,450
I'm gonna take...

686
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,090
I'm gonna loot.

687
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,190
I'm gonna take that.

688
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,350
Stone statue of the Naga.

689
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,330
Oh!

690
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,430
A snake-headed demon.

691
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,110
Stands guard in the corner of the room.

692
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,970
A raised platform stands before it with a bracelet.

693
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,230
Yeah.

694
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,090
I'm just gonna take that.

695
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:12,410
Yep.

696
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,550
That's fine now.

697
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,310
Oh!

698
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:15,590
No!

699
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,690
I shouldn't have taken that.

700
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,170
Wait!

701
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,130
I shouldn't have...

702
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:23,490
Okay!

703
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,370
Okay!

704
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:24,750
I'm sorry!

705
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,450
I'm sorry!

706
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,050
I'm sorry!

707
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,350
I'm sorry!

708
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:26,510
I'm sorry!

709
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:26,650
I'm sorry!

710
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:30,990
Wait!

711
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,390
Can I fool it?

712
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:36,510
Into...

713
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,570
Can I take...

714
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,750
Maybe I can...

715
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,210
Maybe I can trick the ghost.

716
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,350
Hold on.

717
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,610
This guy is so unfazed.

718
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,130
Take this ugly one.

719
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,290
Yeah.

720
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,030
Idiot.

721
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,730
Take that!

722
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,420
Oh.

723
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:06,680
Oh boy.

724
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,120
Okay.

725
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:07,940
Combat ready.

726
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,180
Oh my gosh.

727
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:09,660
Oh!

728
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,340
Okay.

729
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,720
Let's not activate the traps.

730
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:14,820
Okay.

731
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,200
Just big step.

732
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:18,980
Right here.

733
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,780
There you go.

734
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,280
There you go.

735
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:20,940
Nice, nice, nice.

736
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:21,900
Okay.

737
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,220
Alright.

738
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,660
He's gonna wake up.

739
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,540
Oh, I see him right there.

740
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:25,960
Oh!

741
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

742
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,780
Okay, come here.

743
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,000
Come here.

744
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,140
Come here.

745
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,280
Come here, dummy!

746
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,340
No!

747
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,400
You activated the trap, you asshole!

748
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,660
No!

749
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,480
Ouch!

750
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:40,760
Ouch!

751
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,000
Ouch!

752
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,120
Ouch!

753
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,200
Ouch!

754
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,960
Okay, I'm leaving.

755
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,200
What a jerk!

756
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:49,930
It's fine.

757
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,330
He's dead.

758
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:52,790
Okay.

759
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,530
Is he activated?

760
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,790
What do you think?

761
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,690
Okay.

762
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,190
Okay.

763
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,150
Okay, okay, okay.

764
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,530
Okay, we just have to get them before they get us.

765
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:10,250
Okay.

766
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,090
I see those two.

767
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,070
I don't think...

768
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,130
Okay, here we go.

769
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,870
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

770
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:18,810
Is that a pressure plate?

771
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,090
Just die!

772
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:23,910
I can't tell.

773
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:24,810
Out it is!

774
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,370
It's fine.

775
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,090
Um...

776
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:31,870
Oh.

777
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,730
Can you...

778
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:33,050
Can you...

779
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,030
Can you get this guy?

780
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,250
Can you take him out?

781
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,390
Oh.

782
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,490
I got a rune.

783
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,280
Sapphire!

784
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,220
The torch is kind of OP.

785
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,420
Anyway.

786
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,120
Um...

787
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,800
What's this?

788
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,720
This design depicts humanity's fall into decadence, corruption, and ultimately oblivion.

789
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,240
This is humanity's night.

790
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,700
Our time.

791
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,320
Whoa.

792
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,240
This is humanity's night.

793
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,980
Okay.

794
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,580
Good night!

795
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,700
Humanity's night.

796
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:14,880
Humanity's night.

797
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:15,960
Whoa.

798
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,420
The ceiling is so pretty, even.

799
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,220
Okay.

800
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,520
Hello?

801
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,720
Can I light these?

802
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,160
Oh, examine.

803
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:26,860
Yeah, yeah.

804
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,440
I can, actually.

805
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,920
A collection of unlit candles.

806
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,260
Okay.

807
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,580
I remember the candles.

808
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,580
So, because this is night, we keep them off.

809
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:35,980
Oh.

810
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,540
I wish I could see in front of me.

811
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,680
These camera angles are killing me, man.

812
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,500
Ah!

813
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,620
What the hell?

814
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,480
I didn't even touch anything!

815
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,440
Oh, my health.

816
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:58,880
Okay.

817
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,400
Let's, uh...

818
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,620
Let's use a spell.

819
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:01,980
Um...

820
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,220
Recover.

821
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,200
Oh, I didn't even notice I was getting a little tilted.

822
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,040
I didn't even notice.

823
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,520
I think was I naturally tilted?

824
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,860
I actually kind of play like this sometimes.

825
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,900
How is my sanity, though?

826
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,920
Oh wait, that was my sanity, not my health.

827
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,320
Just kidding.

828
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,820
But still.

829
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,200
Okay, sanity is green.

830
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,520
Magic is blue.

831
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,540
Health is red.

832
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,620
Unduchess your angle.

833
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,200
There was definitely a guy in there, though.

834
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,260
But then also the trap.

835
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,820
Oh, I think he stepped on it.

836
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,600
He's the one that stepped on it and he's activating everything.

837
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,080
Come over here.

838
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,240
Come on.

839
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,780
Come on, just step on it.

840
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,140
Come on.

841
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,960
Just make your way over.

842
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,720
Wait, did he die?

843
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,480
You think he got chopped up?

844
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,460
He just died.

845
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,690
I heard him go...

846
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,430
Okay, awesome.

847
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,570
Watch out for traps.

848
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,110
Watch out for...

849
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,010
Oh, that's one, right?

850
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,730
I can't tell if there's any other guy in here, though.

851
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,670
Don't step on it.

852
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,710
Okay, good, good, good.

853
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,250
I don't hear anybody awakening.

854
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:46,450
I only hear sounds of...

855
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,570
Awaken with the sounds of nature.

856
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,920
Careful.

857
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:56,980
Careful.

858
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,000
Careful.

859
00:37:59,240 --> 00:37:59,600
Okay.

860
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,980
Awesome.

861
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,200
Yippee!

862
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,460
Wow.

863
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,400
Hiding in the shadows, a statue watches over the room.

864
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:18,020
A brief inspection reveals flecks of silver metal marring the statue's wrists and neck, possibly indicating that a decoration used to be there.

865
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,420
We have one of them!

866
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,560
We have the silver bracelet.

867
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,320
Okay.

868
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,420
We just gotta get the necklace which was behind our little friend.

869
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,560
Is this the way?

870
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,660
Okay, not yet.

871
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,880
This looks like a door.

872
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,040
Closed door lying in shadow seals off the passageway.

873
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,480
And this...

874
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,280
We can...

875
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,220
use this.

876
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,350
Shhh!

877
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:49,960
Shhh!

878
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,580
What's this?

879
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,040
A tattered scroll.

880
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,620
Dispel magic.

881
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,820
So we're gonna dispel the magic.

882
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:09,640
Ah ha, so we're gonna dispel the thing that's holding him captive.

883
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,580
Ah ha!

884
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,800
Ha ha ha.

885
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,440
For every magic, there's a counter.

886
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:20,900
I have no idea what's going on.

887
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,640
That which is bound is unbound.

888
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:32,620
Be warned that a more powerful magic than this will endure its ravages.

889
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,580
Free the friend.

890
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,240
Release friend-shaped dude.

891
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,080
Dorito man shall be born.

892
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,090
Nethlek and Radgormor.

893
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,790
Oh god.

894
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,030
Do I have those?

895
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,330
I'll have that one.

896
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,870
I'll have a mystery.

897
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,220
We'll... we'll figure it out.

898
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,720
Easy.

899
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,000
I bet there's going to be...

900
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,300
There's going to be a guy here that wakes up though.

901
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,920
And he's going to activate a button.

902
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,720
He's going to activate something.

903
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,960
There's going to be a guy here.

904
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,040
Oh, there's buttons there.

905
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,320
I'm scared.

906
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,580
Oh my gosh, giant button?

907
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,560
Wait, this is a button, right?

908
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,880
I don't think this is avoidable.

909
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,350
We went in one big circle!

910
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:53,510
Oh my gosh.

911
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:55,330
Okay.

912
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,710
Oh, well, that makes it really easy to get back to then.

913
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:58,170
Okay.

914
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:03,570
He really does kind of look like a green Dorito, doesn't he?

915
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:06,870
Well, now.

916
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,330
Maybe.

917
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,180
I don't remember how to do this.

918
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,050
Area?

919
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:33,450
Okay.

920
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,630
Okay.

921
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,190
Oh...

922
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,700
Choose alignment, then choose runes.

923
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:47,080
So, if it's... if I'm trying to dispel green, would I use green, or would I use red?

924
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,040
Is it still... Pokémon rules here, or?

925
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,040
Oh, wait.

926
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,680
New spell.

927
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:56,960
Okay.

928
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,740
It was this one.

929
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:00,740
This is the second one.

930
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,500
And... let's do the mysterious one.

931
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,540
Ah!

932
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,840
We did it!

933
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,480
Always Pokemon rules.

934
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,340
Okay, always Pokemon rules.

935
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,620
Aha!

936
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,460
Okay.

937
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,460
Now we're gonna do some other stuff real quick.

938
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:25,900
Let's enchant our shotgun.

939
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:31,920
Very cool.

940
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,020
Save.

941
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,760
Yeah, that would be a great idea too, wouldn't it?

942
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,720
Let's save the game.

943
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,460
Let's leave the room.

944
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,080
Save... What do you mean it's... What do you mean?

945
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,400
Is it that... Ah!

946
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,460
Let's leave the room.

947
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,960
What the...

948
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,860
Because of the traps.

949
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,260
ViviCore, thanks for the gift.

950
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,040
Oh,

951
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,320
I just enchanted that even.

952
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,820
I'm gonna have to re-enchant it.

953
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,900
Okay, I do wanna save though.

954
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,220
So we'll go back to the main room.

955
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,380
It's okay.

956
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,060
This one is easier than...

957
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,200
The other one, I think.

958
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,520
To get through.

959
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:49,820
Yeah, yeah.

960
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,140
See, see, see?

961
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,680
Easy peasy.

962
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,350
The darkness is coming?

963
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,130
What do you mean by that?

964
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,190
Okay, this room has to be safe.

965
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,030
Please.

966
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:08,810
Thank you.

967
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:11,710
Thank you.

968
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:14,550
Yes, save and continue.

969
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:16,250
Okay.

970
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:18,670
Alright.

971
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,970
Is it this bozo right here?

972
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:23,970
Well, he's not getting up.

973
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,030
Just leave him.

974
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,030
Let him... Let him rest.

975
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,710
Let him sleep, you know?

976
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:29,990
Okay.

977
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,370
Okay, good steps.

978
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,130
Good steps.

979
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:40,770
Soup.

980
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:41,410
Thank you!

981
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,410
Where's the suspense if Indiana Jones never sets off a trap?

982
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,430
The suspense is right here.

983
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:55,370
It's in... column A, column B.

984
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,410
Oh, it is still enchanted.

985
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:58,690
Awesome.

986
00:44:58,910 --> 00:44:59,190
Okay.

987
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:01,770
Okay.

988
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:03,050
Alright, guys.

989
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:05,330
This room is tiny.

990
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,390
So I'm really... I'm kind of nervous.

991
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,030
This room is really small.

992
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:16,790
Like how am I supposed to... how am I supposed to avoid this guy, you know?

993
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:28,910
Get his ass!

994
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,360
I think we did it.

995
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,720
Yeah!

996
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,940
I love the shotgun.

997
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,180
Um, finish him!

998
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,920
Sanity restored, baby.

999
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,730
Shotgun is awesome.

1000
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,050
The torch is awesome.

1001
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,430
It's just, uh...

1002
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,490
Silver necklace is draped around the center.

1003
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,450
I'm just gonna take that.

1004
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:06,630
Uh, yoink!

1005
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,570
I saw something!

1006
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:10,630
Yeah, though.

1007
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:11,730
Yeah, see?

1008
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:12,310
There's blood!

1009
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,050
I saw this... yeah!

1010
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:15,750
Is this from my sanity being low?

1011
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,870
The walls are bleeding.

1012
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,480
What's this?

1013
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,600
This particular depiction represents the prosperity of humanity and its domination over the world.

1014
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,840
This is humanity's day.

1015
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:33,920
It's my day!

1016
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:39,900
Oh!

1017
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,340
The walls are still bleeding.

1018
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:46,740
Maybe I should do a restore on me?

1019
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,960
Are we okay?

1020
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,100
It's not going away!

1021
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,200
I think the walls are just, um...

1022
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,500
like that.

1023
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,020
It's just normal.

1024
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:04,980
Okay, good.

1025
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:05,940
Wait.

1026
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,020
This big button, I can't avoid it.

1027
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,720
Okay, uh...

1028
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:14,460
Argh!

1029
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:17,480
AHH!

1030
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:27,140
OK.

1031
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:29,780
I'll see you later!

1032
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:36,500
Helpitter!

1033
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:40,920
Hahahaha!

1034
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,120
Oh, oh, oh.

1035
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:41,140
Oh, no.

1036
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:41,240
No, no, no!

1037
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,940
Here it goes.

1038
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:43,120
Ha!

1039
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:43,280
It's mine!

1040
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:43,300
It's mine!

1041
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,220
Oh wait.

1042
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,000
I bestow upon thee silver necklace.

1043
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,140
Nice moves, thanks.

1044
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,100
Thanks very much.

1045
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,860
Alright, ikimashou.

1046
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,520
Don't talk to me.

1047
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:09,940
Anybody else?

1048
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,340
Anybody else want this?

1049
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,780
The music is a little dramatic.

1050
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,460
A little freaky.

1051
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,240
I hear someone walking.

1052
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,240
I hear them.

1053
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,300
You.

1054
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,060
Oh my goodness.

1055
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,040
Whoa!

1056
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,420
Green!

1057
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,980
What is this place?

1058
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,160
Oh my gosh, I really feel like I'm in Indiana Jones right now.

1059
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,560
Yippee!

1060
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,820
It's the one-hit kill.

1061
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,540
It's so funny.

1062
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,720
My sanity is getting lower and lower.

1063
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:51,900
Oh, what is that?

1064
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you?

1065
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you?

1066
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,080
What is that thing?

1067
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,560
I can hear my heartbeat in my ears, which is crazy because I'm a ghost.

1068
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,260
Do you think I can one-hit kill this guy?

1069
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,080
No.

1070
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,360
I think I'm gonna use this.

1071
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:16,880
Ah!

1072
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:19,260
Oh!

1073
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:20,780
Oh, ow!

1074
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,380
It's the thing we fought at the beginning!

1075
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,540
That's right.

1076
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,360
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

1077
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,360
Um...

1078
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,170
It's the thing we fought at the beginning.

1079
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,530
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

1080
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:35,710
No, no, no, no, stop stealing.

1081
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:37,150
Stop stealing from me.

1082
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:39,450
Insanity.

1083
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:39,970
Hold on.

1084
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:42,430
Okay.

1085
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:46,530
I shoot it, and then I have to shoot it again.

1086
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,350
We have magic this time.

1087
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,650
Does that even help?

1088
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,430
Let's, um, enchant it, then.

1089
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,120
Yeah, we gotta wait for him.

1090
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,220
I think he gets close to me, and then I can...

1091
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,820
Yeah, he, like, flashes me.

1092
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:07,680
Right?

1093
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,780
I gotta let him get close.

1094
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,660
And I gotta get the head.

1095
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,460
What?

1096
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,460
What's happening?

1097
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,700
What's happening?

1098
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,860
What are you doing?

1099
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:26,120
Ah!

1100
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:26,980
He's really...

1101
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:27,900
Wait, what's going on?

1102
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,340
Oh, he's summoning things?

1103
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,360
No way.

1104
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,620
Oh my gosh.

1105
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,920
Um, let's get my torch out.

1106
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:44,980
Yeah, you freak.

1107
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:45,860
Okay.

1108
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,200
He's really draining my sanity here.

1109
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:57,900
There we go.

1110
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,260
Finish him.

1111
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,060
And we are not a Dutch angle anymore.

1112
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,040
But I will, um...

1113
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,340
I'm glad I pressed the right one.

1114
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,260
Let's, uh, reload.

1115
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,520
I cry every time she uses shotgun shell to finish anatomy.

1116
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:26,680
You know what I mean?

1117
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,720
Not gonna lie, I do too.

1118
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,240
But...

1119
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,120
Um...

1120
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,120
I guess I could just switch to my pistol, huh?

1121
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,900
Or, I could just, like...

1122
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,000
Can't you, like, kick him too?

1123
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,460
Kick him while they're down?

1124
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:43,300
Whoa.

1125
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,340
Hey, wait, what?

1126
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,180
It was green earlier.

1127
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:47,740
What happened?

1128
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,600
Why is it not green anymore?

1129
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,660
It's more badass with the shotgun.

1130
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,420
This is more wasteful for sure.

1131
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:05,390
Misty.

1132
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,310
It's very, um, Silent Hill in here.

1133
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,320
Let's see if I can save.

1134
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,660
Oh, it will let me.

1135
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,320
It will let me.

1136
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,120
Nice.

1137
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:34,700
Alright.

1138
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:35,880
Let's go.

1139
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,240
Oh!

1140
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:43,600
Ow!

1141
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:43,860
Hey.

1142
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,260
It's just how easy...

1143
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:53,540
I even saw it.

1144
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:58,560
As soon as I stepped on it, I saw it.

1145
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,240
All is well.

1146
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,200
Okay.

1147
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,280
Careful.

1148
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,320
Careful.

1149
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,000
Careful.

1150
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,820
Wait, are these all steps?

1151
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,000
I can't tell.

1152
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,520
It's a little dicey here.

1153
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,000
Oh my gosh.

1154
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,180
I can't tell at all.

1155
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,120
Oh gosh.

1156
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,840
Well, I guess we're about to find out!

1157
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:24,240
Ah!

1158
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,100
Oh, we surely found out.

1159
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,520
What's that sound?

1160
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,740
What's making all that noise?

1161
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,340
Who's working here?

1162
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,820
Oh, I don't know if I like this guy.

1163
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:58,260
A statue of carved granite depicting a ceremonial temple guard.

1164
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,640
It appears to be keeping watch on the seated goddess in the corner of the room.

1165
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,720
Okay, perv.

1166
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,000
A statue of an unknown goddess seated in a classical pose.

1167
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,880
She appears to be carrying something valuable.

1168
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:13,920
Oh, I see.

1169
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:17,820
Yeah...

1170
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:18,960
And...

1171
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:20,640
Yeah...

1172
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,060
And...

1173
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,160
Sounds like something I need to grab.

1174
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:31,520
What did I just do?

1175
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:32,700
Oh, no.

1176
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,740
No, no, no.

1177
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,340
Ah!

1178
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,040
Oh my gosh.

1179
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,920
I'm the goddess in the corner of the room.

1180
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:38,660
Yeah!

1181
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,760
Oh, I see.

1182
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,400
Okay.

1183
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,640
We need to put something here.

1184
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:45,680
Do I have to?

1185
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:45,880
Do I have to grab anything?

1186
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:48,740
Nothing.

1187
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,140
It's because you called him a perv.

1188
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:55,240
He's like, oh, you're calling a perv.

1189
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:56,540
Okay.

1190
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,900
And then this looks like a door.

1191
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,240
Yeah, yeah.

1192
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:02,720
We get it.

1193
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,840
There's a panel recessed slightly into the wall.

1194
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,000
It looks like it can be pressed.

1195
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,960
Should Lindsay press the panel?

1196
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,140
Sure.

1197
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,160
Okay.

1198
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:15,660
Okay.

1199
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:17,620
Okay.

1200
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,520
Press the panel, Lindsay.

1201
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:21,880
Oh.

1202
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,120
I was expecting something to happen.

1203
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,580
Oh, it's timed?

1204
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,140
Wait.

1205
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:31,720
Huh?

1206
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,760
What is going...

1207
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,180
Okay.

1208
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,000
So, that does something.

1209
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,860
And it's also timed.

1210
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,520
Okay.

1211
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,460
Let's go into the next room.

1212
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,580
Oh, no.

1213
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,080
Oh, no.

1214
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,220
How am I supposed to get around this one?

1215
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,460
It's just a whole block.

1216
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,640
How are you supposed to get around it?

1217
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,160
Sneak?

1218
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,740
Sneak over it?

1219
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,340
You don't.

1220
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,040
That's the fun.

1221
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,200
Okay.

1222
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,560
Big step, Lindsay.

1223
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:12,920
Ah!

1224
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:13,740
Oh.

1225
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,560
Poisonous gas, Lindsay.

1226
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,300
Poisonous gas.

1227
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:17,720
Okay.

1228
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,380
I think we have to go the other way.

1229
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:20,260
Right?

1230
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,080
Because I can't get out of here.

1231
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,220
Because it'll probably be another loop.

1232
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,660
And once we activate the poisonous gas, we just run through here, you know?

1233
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,440
Probably.

1234
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:29,920
Most likely.

1235
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,000
That is probably the case.

1236
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:32,400
Okay.

1237
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,280
Easy.

1238
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:34,520
Easy.

1239
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:35,720
Easy.

1240
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:36,780
Easy.

1241
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,700
Easy, Lindsay.

1242
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,200
Easy, Lindsay.

1243
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:40,300
Careful steps.

1244
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:41,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1245
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1246
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:42,660
Okay.

1247
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:47,040
That guy is definitely going to reanimate and probably ruin our time.

1248
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:53,350
He's just not going to make it.

1249
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:53,730
Oh, wait.

1250
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:54,670
There's another steppy there.

1251
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:55,370
Oh, my gosh.

1252
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,430
It's another giant steppy.

1253
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,370
You are just going to ruin our time, aren't you?

1254
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:01,190
There he is.

1255
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:01,790
There he goes.

1256
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:02,370
Come on.

1257
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:05,090
Just do it.

1258
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:06,310
Yeah, yeah.

1259
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:19,290
I don't want to recover my sanity.

1260
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:19,650
Okay.

1261
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:22,530
Okay, you guys have to tell me to stop recovering my sanity so much.

1262
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:23,850
Because I also...

1263
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,510
I want to see the craziness that happens, you know what I mean?

1264
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,890
So this one's unavoidable, so...

1265
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:35,450
Okay, let's just go for it.

1266
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:43,330
If you get too low health, your movement speed slows.

1267
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:46,610
If that happens in a gas room, you're pretty much dead.

1268
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:48,390
Rushing without healing got me killed twice.

1269
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:51,290
Thank you, Rhett, for the warning.

1270
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,340
Oh gosh,

1271
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:31,600
I can't see.

1272
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,400
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1273
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,240
Oh, he's crawling?

1274
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,420
Oh, okay.

1275
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,100
Okay, see, now I can...

1276
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,780
Here, I'll equip this and I'll finish him.

1277
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,380
Right?

1278
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,520
Finish him!

1279
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,200
Yeah!

1280
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,200
What was...

1281
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,440
Ooh, my health is at real bad.

1282
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,540
Hold on, I gotta get to my quick spells.

1283
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,580
Okay, recover health was this one.

1284
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,420
Oh my gosh, it does not recover a lot.

1285
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,360
And we lost a lot...

1286
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:16,960
I think it's just moving around is what gets us to gain more magic.

1287
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,440
Pretty sure.

1288
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,280
So, if we just kinda walk...

1289
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,360
We'll just do a little dance here and there.

1290
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:34,580
And then, we also need to do the dispel magic cast.

1291
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,440
What was it?

1292
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:37,760
Sorry.

1293
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,080
It's red, so it should be blue.

1294
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:40,740
Okay, I was right.

1295
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:46,900
Oh!

1296
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,940
Wait, what is this?

1297
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,180
How did it even...

1298
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:57,500
What...

1299
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,100
What is this?

1300
00:59:59,100 --> 00:59:59,120
What is that?

1301
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,040
Okay.

1302
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:02,740
Cool.

1303
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,100
I haven't even seen that.

1304
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:05,340
Okay.

1305
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,140
We're just gonna run around the room a little bit.

1306
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,460
Actually, we're gonna be an archaeologist for two seconds.

1307
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:13,780
Secret chamber?

1308
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,360
Is that the important secret you guys were talking about?

1309
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:21,600
A dirt-encrusted necklace is hidden behind the cobwebs.

1310
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,920
Found a necklace!

1311
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:26,200
Okay.

1312
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,220
Oh, man.

1313
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,080
Can you imagine being, like, one of the poorest people in the world?

1314
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,160
One of the people that gets, like, the ugly necklace?

1315
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,880
This has the panel!

1316
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:39,660
Okay.

1317
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,220
I don't understand what it does.

1318
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,700
And then it...

1319
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,880
It's very fast, so it's not like I can get to the other rooms.

1320
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,180
I feel, you know?

1321
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,620
Okay, my magic is getting there.

1322
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:01,980
Okay.

1323
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:02,480
Okay.

1324
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,340
Now for our thicker necklace.

1325
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,260
Hopefully that's better, right?

1326
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,240
Yeah, who's the poor sap that got gifted this necklace?

1327
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,780
Everybody else gets diamonds.

1328
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,140
You know, someone's getting the metal bracelet.

1329
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,520
Someone's getting the... whatever this...

1330
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,240
It just says necklace.

1331
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,820
It doesn't even say what it's made out of.

1332
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:31,780
Oh great, I got a necklace made out of gravel!

1333
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:32,720
Thanks.

1334
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:33,780
Good.

1335
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:37,680
Check.

1336
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:40,600
Yeah, what does it say?

1337
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:45,960
This necklace is encrusted with cysts of corroded metal upon its surface.

1338
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,780
It's difficult to tell what it looks like.

1339
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,320
Perhaps it can be cleaned somehow.

1340
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,460
I'm trying to clean it?

1341
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:51,880
Okay.

1342
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,680
I see that guy down there.

1343
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,180
But I also see this right here.

1344
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,160
Is this a... is this poison?

1345
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,000
Here he comes!

1346
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,020
He's gonna activate every trap on the way!

1347
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,600
Maybe he'll die.

1348
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:13,620
Oh my gosh.

1349
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:14,560
Die.

1350
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:15,760
Oh my gosh.

1351
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:16,520
Will we get lucky?

1352
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:17,880
Activate that trap.

1353
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:24,750
We did not get lucky.

1354
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,020
His timing is impeccable.

1355
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:35,640
If he can do it, I can do it.

1356
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,380
Probably.

1357
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:41,980
See ya!

1358
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,560
Just a single...

1359
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:48,980
Okay.

1360
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:50,780
Alright.

1361
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,420
Is this a... is this a booby trap?

1362
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:55,400
Is this a booby trap?

1363
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,580
Oh no no no!

1364
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,740
Oh shoot!

1365
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:02,580
Just run!

1366
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,080
Oh.

1367
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:07,420
Hello.

1368
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:08,820
Ah!

1369
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:09,580
Oh my gosh.

1370
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,280
Everything is bad, you guys.

1371
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,360
Everything is bad.

1372
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,740
Where's my shotgun?

1373
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,020
Oh here it is.

1374
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,220
But I have to...

1375
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,360
I can't tell if I missed or...

1376
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,720
If he just is immune.

1377
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:32,260
Um...

1378
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:38,490
Oh my gosh.

1379
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:39,110
Oh my gosh.

1380
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:41,590
That's right.

1381
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:42,850
And uh... you.

1382
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,090
Oh my god!

1383
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:44,330
No!

1384
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:47,570
This is messed up!

1385
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:48,250
No!

1386
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:51,730
Please turn around.

1387
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,060
Oh my gosh.

1388
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:56,820
I'm stuck on the wall.

1389
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:57,800
Please!

1390
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:58,380
Turn around!

1391
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,140
How can I like, chop off their arms?

1392
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:23,320
Idiot!

1393
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,230
What the fuck?

1394
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:31,410
This is so messed up!

1395
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:33,450
Oh no no no no no!

1396
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,090
Wait wait wait wait wait!

1397
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:36,170
Um...

1398
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,170
Oh no!

1399
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:38,730
Uh...

1400
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:39,810
Uh...

1401
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:43,270
Wait how...

1402
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:44,010
Did you forget?

1403
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,150
Yes I did.

1404
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:45,770
Um...

1405
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:46,490
I did forget.

1406
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:49,230
The red guy's regen?

1407
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:51,150
Okay...

1408
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:51,910
So...

1409
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:52,930
Let's um...

1410
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:58,600
And then...

1411
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:02,740
Enchant...

1412
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,360
Blue...

1413
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,360
I don't wanna waste my bullets.

1414
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,480
Nice.

1415
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,100
And you're back at the end.

1416
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:13,960
Ow!

1417
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:32,870
Ow Ow.

1418
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:34,630
Finish him!

1419
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:35,110
Where?

1420
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:35,490
Oh...

1421
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:35,850
Finish him?

1422
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:36,390
Finish him.

1423
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:37,130
Finish him.

1424
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:38,530
Oh come on!

1425
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:40,530
He's not letting me finish him!

1426
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:44,410
Um...

1427
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:45,590
Uh...

1428
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:46,810
Um...

1429
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,230
I used my gun...

1430
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,470
Finish him!

1431
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:52,590
Finish him!

1432
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:53,610
Finish.

1433
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:54,470
Finish him.

1434
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:56,450
Oh, he's gone.

1435
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:57,290
Just kidding.

1436
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:00,510
Okay, well...

1437
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,410
I guess it's fine.

1438
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:03,190
Whatever.

1439
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:06,810
Whatever!

1440
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,340
Where is this though?

1441
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,840
I don't remember seeing this at all!

1442
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,600
This little... whatever area.

1443
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,860
Where is that?

1444
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:32,880
And then another thing to push.

1445
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:37,960
What a silly game.

1446
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,320
A face!

1447
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,500
What did I just...

1448
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:51,500
What was that?

1449
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:53,720
Oh.

1450
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,360
Okay.

1451
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,840
It just returned.

1452
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:58,760
That's all that was.

1453
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,080
Yeah, the timer.

1454
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:01,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1455
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:03,140
Okay.

1456
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,040
How's my health doing?

1457
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,340
Let's heal again.

1458
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,380
In fact, I'm gonna heal twice.

1459
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,080
Nice!

1460
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,540
Welcome to membership.

1461
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,000
Thank you!

1462
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:22,540
Okay.

1463
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,560
Onwards, I guess?

1464
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,740
I hate these angles, man.

1465
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,800
They're so rude.

1466
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:33,180
Okay.

1467
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,000
Don't do it.

1468
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,040
Yeah, I got you before you could even step there.

1469
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,040
Bozo.

1470
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,020
Oh no, there's like two more down there.

1471
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:48,250
Yeah, idiot.

1472
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:48,890
Oh.

1473
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:52,830
Hiding in the shadows, the statue watches over the room.

1474
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:55,390
Gold flecks of metal mar the statue's wrist and neck.

1475
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:58,710
Possibly indicating that some kind of adornment used to be there.

1476
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:00,650
Okay, we know where the gold bracelet is.

1477
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:02,690
I forgot about my pre-super chat.

1478
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:03,550
Thanks!

1479
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:04,970
Thanks for three months!

1480
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,370
You're awesome, Minto.

1481
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:07,890
Thank you!

1482
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:13,630
Being afraid of angles is a very Lovecraft thing.

1483
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:14,530
Is it really?

1484
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:17,410
I know this game is very inspired, right?

1485
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:18,190
So...

1486
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:24,690
The necklace is perhaps...

1487
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,310
This is perhaps a gold necklace.

1488
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:28,010
But it said metal.

1489
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:30,370
Corroded metal.

1490
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:31,150
So maybe...

1491
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:31,590
I don't know.

1492
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:32,830
If we clean it, who knows?

1493
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:35,430
Paragon, paragon, paragon, paragon.

1494
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,070
So true.

1495
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:38,610
So true, bestie.

1496
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:39,350
Paragon.

1497
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:45,890
Gold is a metal.

1498
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,190
Okay, but it needs to be...

1499
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:50,710
You know, some things just say metal.

1500
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,790
They should say gold metal.

1501
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:58,570
What did you say?

1502
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:00,850
Did you click something?

1503
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:01,730
Did you press something?

1504
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:06,460
What was that?

1505
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,060
I'm just gonna keep going.

1506
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:08,960
Wait, actually...

1507
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,320
I wanted to die first.

1508
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,640
Yeah, there we go.

1509
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,160
Welcome to the membership, thank you.

1510
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:18,940
Alright.

1511
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:26,580
Anybody else?

1512
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:30,400
That's it?

1513
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:32,500
That's it?

1514
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:32,960
Wow, that's a lot.

1515
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:33,180
That's it!

1516
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,240
Torch is so OP.

1517
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,120
I know, I'm obsessed with it.

1518
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,160
You can't finish them with it!

1519
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,960
I guess if I like, did this...

1520
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:43,800
That... oh.

1521
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,320
I was too slow.

1522
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,380
But it's just so OP, right?

1523
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:52,160
Push!

1524
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,380
Still

1525
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,480
don't know what this is supposed to do.

1526
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,220
I'm just pushing all of them.

1527
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,620
What is this?

1528
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,460
There is a small base in...

1529
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:06,760
or font?

1530
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,920
Situated beneath the statue.

1531
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:09,860
Besides that...

1532
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:13,940
Oh, besides that, an orb-shaped button sits on a panel of stone.

1533
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,660
Should Lindsey push the button?

1534
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:17,420
Hold on, Lindsey.

1535
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:18,620
Lindsey, give me a second.

1536
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,660
Lindsey, Lindsey, we're gonna do this spell first.

1537
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,380
Screen.

1538
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,440
The orb!

1539
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:44,520
Oh!

1540
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,020
Did you see that?

1541
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,700
My camera just tilted.

1542
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,860
Okay, hold on though.

1543
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:54,380
Maybe I just passed it and never saw it.

1544
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,800
Now we're back to Dutch Angling.

1545
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:01,060
It was definitely in one of the hallways.

1546
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,420
Just need to find that place now.

1547
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,380
Is it down here?

1548
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,740
Have I been through here?

1549
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,620
I don't know where I've...

1550
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,660
Cotton Eye Joe, where did you come from?

1551
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:19,240
Where did you go?

1552
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,020
That's me right now.

1553
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:22,100
So I'm in here.

1554
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,280
Wait!

1555
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:27,620
See?

1556
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:28,300
There's that...

1557
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,700
There's a door right there.

1558
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,500
There's like a little entrance.

1559
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,100
Maybe that?

1560
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:35,020
Maybe it's that one?

1561
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,890
This is...

1562
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:43,690
This is the next hallway?

1563
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:45,370
Hold on, let's see which one this is.

1564
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:47,650
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1565
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:51,090
Should I press the button first though?

1566
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:53,190
Lindsay!

1567
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:54,970
Should Lindsay push the button?

1568
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:55,850
No.

1569
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,070
I wanna go see first.

1570
01:11:58,610 --> 01:11:59,730
I wanna go see first.

1571
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,460
Wait, that was for the necklace?

1572
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,040
You think so?

1573
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:09,760
Oh, maybe...

1574
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,520
Oh, I think you're right.

1575
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:20,420
No!

1576
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:21,300
Wait!

1577
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,660
Okay, hold on.

1578
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:23,220
Hold on.

1579
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:23,760
Hear me out.

1580
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:24,700
Is there a way to...

1581
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,300
Zoom in?

1582
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:27,780
C-stick.

1583
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:30,300
See?

1584
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:30,680
There!

1585
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:32,980
I think that's it right there.

1586
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,540
I think we were in the right hallway before.

1587
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:37,920
Why is it...

1588
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,360
Why is it inverted all of a sudden?

1589
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:42,780
Yeah, I think it's that one.

1590
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,020
I think it's that one instead.

1591
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,140
Ha ha ha!

1592
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:47,440
Okay, we go back.

1593
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:54,530
Love how calm he is through all of this.

1594
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,730
He walks with such like...

1595
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:57,430
Certainty.

1596
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,650
With such like...

1597
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:01,030
Purpose, you know?

1598
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,690
So maybe I should push the button.

1599
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:06,470
Is there no ammo supply in the game?

1600
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:07,410
I don't think so.

1601
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:08,270
And in fact...

1602
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:09,970
Thanks for bringing that up.

1603
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:10,830
Because...

1604
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:13,890
I would like to reload before we...

1605
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:17,330
Encounter anything else, you know?

1606
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:19,550
So let's reload this gun!

1607
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:21,590
Let's reload...

1608
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:22,890
This gun!

1609
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:27,930
Okay!

1610
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:29,890
Yes!

1611
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:31,510
And let's save.

1612
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:39,130
Okay!

1613
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:41,470
Reload the torch.

1614
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:42,450
So true.

1615
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:50,310
I guess I'll push it.

1616
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:53,550
I'm scared.

1617
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:54,590
Oh!

1618
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:54,990
Oh!

1619
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:56,190
It's just water!

1620
01:13:58,370 --> 01:13:59,510
Oh, it's...

1621
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:00,390
Water.

1622
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:01,770
Ha ha ha!

1623
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:04,790
The water smells like a strong acid.

1624
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:07,330
Strong enough to dissolve metal or flesh.

1625
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:08,670
If Lindsay isn't careful.

1626
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:11,970
Oh!

1627
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:12,670
No, no, no!

1628
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:13,530
Wait, wait, wait!

1629
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:13,930
Lindsay!

1630
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:21,120
Push the button.

1631
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:26,060
Yes!

1632
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:31,840
And...

1633
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:32,620
Clean!

1634
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:33,420
Oh!

1635
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,180
Lindsay has found a gold necklace!

1636
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:41,020
I don't know if we should touch that like so immediately.

1637
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,180
With our bare hands.

1638
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:44,580
Right after it like kind of soaked in the acid.

1639
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:45,480
But you know, whatever.

1640
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,500
I was ready to drink it.

1641
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,020
Resplendent with glowing gems.

1642
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,200
Wow.

1643
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:56,180
Resplendent.

1644
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,050
So in here.

1645
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:04,050
Okay.

1646
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:07,470
Let's do our best not to activate anything.

1647
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:09,650
Careful.

1648
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:12,910
Oh.

1649
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:15,170
This one is kind of unavoidable.

1650
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:15,570
I think.

1651
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:16,830
Um.

1652
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:18,930
Right.

1653
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:24,430
Anyway.

1654
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:30,280
This!

1655
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,000
So, no.

1656
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:34,300
We haven't been in here before then.

1657
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:34,740
Oh.

1658
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:35,040
Okay.

1659
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:38,480
Look at all them skellies.

1660
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:40,820
There appears to be a hole in the wall.

1661
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:43,620
It is large enough for a small dog to pass through.

1662
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,000
Ruff!

1663
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:45,520
Ruff!

1664
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:45,760
Ruff!

1665
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,100
Ruff!

1666
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,340
I don't have that.

1667
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:48,840
Wait.

1668
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,520
What am I supposed to do?

1669
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:53,160
Um.

1670
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:58,170
Just break it down, Lindsey!

1671
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:00,390
Break it down!

1672
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:01,730
Break it down, Lindsey!

1673
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:09,980
Chat, why did you do that?

1674
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,450
I got that dog in me.

1675
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,320
There's a spell called Summon Trapper that you can send a creature in there.

1676
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,440
Get it later in this chapter.

1677
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:29,740
Oh.

1678
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:32,060
Another hot dog.

1679
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:32,720
Oh.

1680
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:34,460
Okay.

1681
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,400
So, we need to go back to that one room.

1682
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,220
Um.

1683
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:43,940
I think it's this one, isn't it?

1684
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:45,720
Yes.

1685
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:50,180
Guys, if we still...

1686
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:55,320
I still am not sure what to do with this.

1687
01:16:59,160 --> 01:16:59,920
What do...

1688
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,280
Is there anything I can put here, or...?

1689
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:02,700
Oh.

1690
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:09,870
Spell 9?

1691
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:11,450
Whatever it is?

1692
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:16,550
Keep a summon.

1693
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:17,490
I don't have a summon.

1694
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:19,470
What do you mean a summon?

1695
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:22,490
I don't have one.

1696
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:27,430
I don't think I got any new runes.

1697
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:28,450
Oh wait!

1698
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:29,230
Summon!

1699
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:34,930
I think we have to summon...

1700
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:37,010
item?

1701
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:38,130
Summon area?

1702
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:48,610
I don't know how to tell you this, but you medically got that dog in you.

1703
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:52,970
But you don't have the rune.

1704
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:53,870
I just have...

1705
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:56,110
I have this.

1706
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:58,690
I don't know if it counts.

1707
01:17:59,230 --> 01:17:59,450
Does it?

1708
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:03,030
I'm just gonna summon...

1709
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,020
No, it doesn't count.

1710
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,260
How do I...

1711
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,980
How do I...

1712
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:26,570
What's it called?

1713
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:31,470
Tear.

1714
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:35,650
Where did we get this one?

1715
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:38,090
Wait, this is the one that we...

1716
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:41,550
Didn't we find this like behind a cobweb or something?

1717
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:46,970
So if I...

1718
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:47,930
New spell.

1719
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:48,950
Okay, hold on.

1720
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:51,350
Tear.

1721
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:55,310
Yeah, it doesn't even show up.

1722
01:18:57,170 --> 01:19:00,050
Yeah, the negative one.

1723
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:01,150
Oh...

1724
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:04,470
How...

1725
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:08,370
How do I turn it from a slab into a rune?

1726
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:15,830
How do I turn it from that into a rune?

1727
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,030
I got the codec, yeah.

1728
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:23,770
Gotta find where the rune is.

1729
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:29,310
The codec explains what it is.

1730
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:32,990
The rune is to use it.

1731
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:35,150
Like the codec gives it...

1732
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:37,250
It gives the name and what it does.

1733
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,450
Got it.

1734
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:39,810
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

1735
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:43,310
Okay, where...

1736
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:45,450
Okay.

1737
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:46,810
We are...

1738
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:47,790
Here.

1739
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:48,610
Oh, let's see.

1740
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:48,850
Okay.

1741
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:49,530
Where have...

1742
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:51,250
Okay, we've been through all these rooms.

1743
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:57,190
Is there...

1744
01:19:58,870 --> 01:19:59,350
What's...

1745
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,070
So yeah, Z button is current.

1746
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:03,890
So...

1747
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:05,270
Where we're at.

1748
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:07,090
X...

1749
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:09,430
Okay, there's no more down.

1750
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:11,870
Is it up?

1751
01:20:12,730 --> 01:20:13,290
Stairs?

1752
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:16,430
Enemies have a rune floating inside them.

1753
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:19,230
Did I miss...

1754
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,310
A guy?

1755
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:24,030
You can solve the bracelet puzzle room you're in right now.

1756
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:25,030
How though?

1757
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:26,230
If I can't summon something.

1758
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,170
Unless it's with this.

1759
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:39,070
Step on the pad and run for the bracelet.

1760
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:41,070
We could try.

1761
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:47,150
Grab it!

1762
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:47,710
Oh.

1763
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:50,610
Maybe we actually can.

1764
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:51,050
Oh.

1765
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:53,270
I thought it was gonna be way faster.

1766
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,280
I got a gold bracelet!

1767
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:05,960
Yay!

1768
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:06,700
I got a gold bracelet!

1769
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:07,600
Oh.

1770
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,060
Hope he doesn't realize.

1771
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:09,820
Okay.

1772
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,500
I think we're good.

1773
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:16,080
There's a level below this.

1774
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:19,100
Oh, it's not showing it when I press X.

1775
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,340
Like, down floor.

1776
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:23,360
So, we must find it, I suppose?

1777
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:26,540
I...

1778
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:29,160
Suppose?

1779
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,020
It keeps looking...

1780
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:33,500
Oh my gosh.

1781
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,280
I keep seeing, like, right here.

1782
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,800
And thinking that it's an entrance.

1783
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,740
Like, a doorway.

1784
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:39,740
It might be.

1785
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:40,800
I can't tell.

1786
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,240
Okay.

1787
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:46,800
Who was it that needed the...

1788
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,560
The stuff?

1789
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,580
Where was it?

1790
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,500
Which room was it?

1791
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,200
There's so many.

1792
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:06,640
Probably opens up.

1793
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:07,020
Yeah.

1794
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:07,340
Probably.

1795
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,240
The right hallway?

1796
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,060
Okay.

1797
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:13,300
Okay.

1798
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:15,300
Let's see.

1799
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:16,680
This one activates the...

1800
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,440
This activates the...

1801
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,200
The...

1802
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:22,580
The...

1803
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:22,980
The...

1804
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,120
What's that word?

1805
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:25,500
The poison gas.

1806
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,120
So, I don't know if I wanna go through this.

1807
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:37,640
Run, Lindsey!

1808
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:38,020
Run!

1809
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:40,360
Lindsey.

1810
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:41,040
Lindsey.

1811
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:41,980
We're in trouble, Lindsey.

1812
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,040
Lindsey, we're in trouble.

1813
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:44,020
Lindsey, we're in trouble.

1814
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:44,460
Lindsey, we're in trouble.

1815
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:44,480
Okay.

1816
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,020
Come on.

1817
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:47,840
Oh my gosh.

1818
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,920
Not this room.

1819
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,780
Are we okay?

1820
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,020
We're fine.

1821
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,740
Sorry, I know I keep opening.

1822
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,040
Okay, so this is...

1823
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,320
We're potentially...

1824
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:19,180
So this is where we got the...

1825
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:19,340
The...

1826
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:23,720
The necklace.

1827
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:25,240
Oh, wait!

1828
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,080
It's right here!

1829
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:26,520
It's right here!

1830
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:30,600
Yes!

1831
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:31,300
Okay, okay.

1832
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:34,640
You'll get... this?

1833
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:42,000
Since the game doesn't tell you and you can only read in a guidebook, the panel disabled traps for 30 seconds.

1834
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:43,280
Right!

1835
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:44,680
Oh my gosh, thank you!

1836
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:47,800
I was like... I was feeling like I was really missing something.

1837
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,200
Thank you!

1838
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:56,520
This game is wild.

1839
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,180
Why don't they tell you?

1840
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:01,900
Remember me, Alex.

1841
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:05,620
How can I forget you, Grandpa?

1842
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,840
Oh my gosh, I forgot we were a girl.

1843
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:08,740
You always meant the most to me.

1844
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:09,980
Ever since...

1845
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,260
Ever since my parents died.

1846
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:16,340
Yes.

1847
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:17,840
Ever since they were killed.

1848
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:20,540
You've been my little girl.

1849
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:21,520
Grandpa.

1850
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:23,680
Yes.

1851
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:24,740
Yes.

1852
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,180
My little girl.

1853
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:30,160
Okay, I was about to say that, but I didn't think he would say that.

1854
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:31,560
This can't be happening.

1855
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:34,320
You good?

1856
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,640
This can't be happening.

1857
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:40,760
I want to save here, but it probably won't let me because of the traps.

1858
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,340
Now it definitely won't let me.

1859
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,400
Because of all the crazy people in here.

1860
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:47,720
What's this?

1861
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:51,740
Oh!

1862
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,340
Oh, I get... that's so cool.

1863
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:01,680
There's a lot of guys down here, though.

1864
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,900
Oh, they're all regenerative.

1865
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:05,540
Oh, they're all red monsters.

1866
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:06,760
No!

1867
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:10,840
That's kind of lame.

1868
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:12,440
Don't like that.

1869
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,260
I hear something coming up.

1870
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:19,260
Something's really squelching in my ear.

1871
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,960
Two and a half hours of my time from becoming a geriatric.

1872
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:24,700
What does that mean?

1873
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:28,760
Let's...

1874
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:33,430
What do I... Okay.

1875
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:36,550
For the big guy downstairs, we're definitely going to want to use the shotgun.

1876
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:39,890
But...

1877
01:25:41,330 --> 01:25:42,990
What do I want to use for the other guys?

1878
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:43,910
Maybe just the...

1879
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:46,090
Maybe we just slice and dice them?

1880
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:48,170
Maybe?

1881
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:48,250
Maybe?

1882
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:51,330
Oh, birthday!

1883
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,970
Happy early birthday!

1884
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:00,130
Handgun for the guys.

1885
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:05,570
Oh my gosh, it gets so dark.

1886
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:07,830
It gets so dark.

1887
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:08,850
I don't like that.

1888
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:09,570
I don't like it.

1889
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:12,510
Blue.

1890
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:13,410
On my gun.

1891
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:21,770
My item is now enchanted.

1892
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:24,170
Oh, we're slightly tilted again.

1893
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:24,850
Oh my gosh.

1894
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:31,290
Oh no, no, no.

1895
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:41,470
Reload!

1896
01:26:42,370 --> 01:26:42,930
Uh...

1897
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:47,270
Why aren't you reloading, you idiot?

1898
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:49,390
What's taking him so long?

1899
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:54,270
It wasn't reloading!

1900
01:26:54,270 --> 01:26:56,850
I was holding down Z, but he wasn't reloading!

1901
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:01,250
Well, that's not good.

1902
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:01,810
Okay.

1903
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:03,850
Come on, reload.

1904
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:05,570
I don't think I can walk and reload.

1905
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:06,490
I think that's the issue.

1906
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:08,670
Okay, we're just going to have to slice and dice...

1907
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:11,370
We're just going to have to slice and dice them.

1908
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:12,910
Finish him!

1909
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:13,310
Finish him!

1910
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:16,670
Oh...

1911
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:22,970
Anybody else coming up here?

1912
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:31,290
What a

1913
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:38,540
jerk!

1914
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:45,980
How's my health?

1915
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:47,580
Okay, we're good on health.

1916
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:48,460
Time to go.

1917
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:52,960
I can't tell if I'm aiming at him or not.

1918
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:53,900
Oh my gosh!

1919
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:54,340
Oh my gosh!

1920
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:54,980
Oh my gosh!

1921
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:55,540
Ouch!

1922
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:55,820
Ouch!

1923
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:56,020
Ouch!

1924
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:56,180
Ouch!

1925
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:58,460
Are you aiming?

1926
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:00,580
Are you hitting him?

1927
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:04,800
Is he going to come up here?

1928
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:10,840
Oh my god.

1929
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:23,180
I think that did it.

1930
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:25,220
Nice!

1931
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:32,910
Finish him!

1932
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:35,370
Oh, little whack!

1933
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:38,150
He just goes...

1934
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:40,790
Yippee!

1935
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:43,350
Now can we save?

1936
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:46,450
Okay, before we save though, I'm going to equip and I'm going to reload.

1937
01:28:48,510 --> 01:28:48,950
Slowpoke.

1938
01:28:49,210 --> 01:28:51,590
I thought you could run and reload at the same time.

1939
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:54,450
Clearly Lindsey is not the brightest bunch.

1940
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:56,930
Okay, there we go.

1941
01:28:58,610 --> 01:28:59,730
Little flick of the wrist.

1942
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:00,330
Yeah, exactly.

1943
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:01,190
Oop.

1944
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:05,490
That means the room is safe.

1945
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:07,210
That means the room is safe.

1946
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:10,610
Oh, let's put our...

1947
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:13,550
One thing about this game...

1948
01:29:14,030 --> 01:29:16,150
I think my only gripe about the game...

1949
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:19,230
Not only, but you know, a bigger gripe about the game is...

1950
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:21,110
So much going into the menu.

1951
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:22,030
You know?

1952
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:22,750
Ah,

1953
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:32,950
what's that?

1954
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:38,210
Yeah, it kinda like takes you out of the game.

1955
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:44,090
I am a little bit, you know, but I'm pretty menu-centric game.

1956
01:29:44,230 --> 01:29:45,510
It is very menu-centric.

1957
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:57,410
These are like even more ancient traps.

1958
01:30:00,890 --> 01:30:01,930
Anything down here?

1959
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,700
I don't mind the menus too much.

1960
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:07,240
Let's go.

1961
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:09,880
I'm glad then.

1962
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:14,700
I think I don't mind it so much but...

1963
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:19,600
What the hell?

1964
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,580
Lindsay, are you okay?

1965
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,400
Lindsay, are you alright?

1966
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,340
Are you alright, friend?

1967
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:40,940
Are you alright, buddy?

1968
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:46,100
Okay, this one, I don't know if we can get past.

1969
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,380
Lindsay, are you okay?

1970
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:52,840
Are you okay?

1971
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:54,120
Are you okay, buddy?

1972
01:30:57,860 --> 01:30:58,180
Okay.

1973
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:03,440
We're fine.

1974
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:04,760
Everything is good.

1975
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:07,620
Oh.

1976
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,160
There's a lot of guys here.

1977
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:09,440
Ah!

1978
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:10,660
Ah!

1979
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:11,800
Ah!

1980
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:12,280
Run!

1981
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:12,780
Run, run!

1982
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,180
Yeah!

1983
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:15,420
Run, run, run!

1984
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:16,320
Oh!

1985
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:17,640
Oh.

1986
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:18,140
Run!

1987
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,140
I love the torch!

1988
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:27,880
Whoa!

1989
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,600
Oh my gosh, I just noticed the thing in the middle.

1990
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,020
Hardcore.

1991
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,020
What about this guy?

1992
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,260
He's not gonna wake up?

1993
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:40,040
Yeah!

1994
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:46,960
It's hard.

1995
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:47,540
He's hiding something.

1996
01:31:56,370 --> 01:32:00,130
We got another stone slab.

1997
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:03,510
It's a magical codex!

1998
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:05,410
Magical.

1999
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:07,050
Magical.

2000
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:08,030
This thing is...

2001
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:09,790
Oh my god, this thing is so metal.

2002
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:11,950
Wow, look at that.

2003
01:32:13,790 --> 01:32:16,290
Also, you just think, why are these like...

2004
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:18,950
Why are these torches lit, you know?

2005
01:32:21,890 --> 01:32:22,950
What the hell?

2006
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:37,390
I'm gonna go in there a little bit.

2007
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:37,470
Okay!

2008
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:39,530
Oh, I know that guy!

2009
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:42,490
That's just like...

2010
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:43,030
Oh!

2011
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:43,810
Yeah, that's...

2012
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:44,770
Oh, yeah!

2013
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:44,970
That's Jeff!

2014
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:46,310
That's Jeff!

2015
01:32:48,690 --> 01:32:49,850
Jeff the God.

2016
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:51,010
Oh, I know that guy.

2017
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:54,570
My creator...

2018
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:55,050
Oh, there's a guy here.

2019
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:56,210
There's like a meteor and everything.

2020
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:57,450
What is going on?

2021
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:02,110
This thing is so... Oh, look at all of them bowing before him!

2022
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:10,150
This creature is really just like some prehistoric something or other crawled out from the ocean.

2023
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:13,610
And they're like, whoa!

2024
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:17,310
We love you, Jeff!

2025
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:23,440
Paragon.

2026
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:23,920
Manterbok.

2027
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:24,480
Jeff.

2028
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,240
I hate when it pops.

2029
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:33,320
I came in through that way, so we're going this way.

2030
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:36,980
Can I save?

2031
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:38,620
Sorry, I know I'm save scumming.

2032
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,420
Oh, we cannot.

2033
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,180
I think it's this guy's fault.

2034
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:46,420
It's this bozo's fault right here.

2035
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:48,640
He won't even wake up, but he says it's too dangerous.

2036
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:55,270
The darkness is coming!

2037
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:56,110
The darkness is coming!

2038
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:09,270
Anybody here?

2039
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:12,970
Anybody here?

2040
01:34:15,330 --> 01:34:16,670
Anybody here?

2041
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:19,450
Anybody here?

2042
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:24,670
We're fine.

2043
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:27,650
I almost missed these ones.

2044
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:30,450
Shuffle.

2045
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:30,850
Shuffle.

2046
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:31,490
Shuffle.

2047
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:32,290
Do the Lindsay shuffle.

2048
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:36,350
Your human tongues cannot pronounce my name, so you can call me Jeff.

2049
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:40,850
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

2050
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:50,200
I hate.

2051
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:51,320
I hate.

2052
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:53,780
I have a big hatred.

2053
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:58,040
I hate.

2054
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:01,160
I don't know.

2055
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:02,240
I think they're going to hit me.

2056
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:04,960
I don't think I'm going to...

2057
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,540
My items are now enchanted!

2058
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,740
Uh, aim.

2059
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,000
Oh my gosh, run.

2060
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:19,860
Run!

2061
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:27,210
Who's crying?

2062
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:29,490
My baby is crying!

2063
01:35:32,110 --> 01:35:32,670
Reload!

2064
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:32,990
Reload!

2065
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:34,150
Good job.

2066
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:34,470
Good job.

2067
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:54,280
Execute him!

2068
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:56,020
Um, oh, I should reload.

2069
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:58,920
I'm going to equip this and finish him.

2070
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:03,700
Oh, I think it was my sanity was too low.

2071
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:06,580
That was the sound.

2072
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,600
Oh, whack!

2073
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,460
A little whack there.

2074
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:16,420
A little whack.

2075
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:18,520
Yippee!

2076
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:29,090
I should probably start using my sword more than the gun.

2077
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:30,610
Yeah.

2078
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:31,370
Yeah.

2079
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:35,010
Um, I should start using my sword more than the gun.

2080
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:37,350
Seventeenth is my birthday.

2081
01:36:37,350 --> 01:36:38,170
Can I have a happy birthday?

2082
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:39,670
Sayo!

2083
01:36:39,870 --> 01:36:41,170
Happy early birthday!

2084
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:42,930
Thank you for five months.

2085
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:43,450
Thank you!

2086
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:46,110
Happy birthday to you.

2087
01:36:46,270 --> 01:36:48,130
Happy birthday to you.

2088
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:50,450
Happy birthday, dear Sayo.

2089
01:36:51,550 --> 01:36:53,830
Happy birthday to you.

2090
01:36:56,410 --> 01:36:57,370
Happy birthday.

2091
01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:00,170
Um, let's see.

2092
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:00,890
Okay, my torch.

2093
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:04,950
Gosh, I feel like this chapter is pretty long.

2094
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,400
Oh my gosh.

2095
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:12,960
Stop trying to get me.

2096
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:18,300
There was that one guy.

2097
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:19,920
We did not finish him.

2098
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,420
So we'll have to remember that when we go back through that.

2099
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:23,280
Oh, shoot!

2100
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:25,140
When we go back through the hallway!

2101
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:27,240
Oh, no!

2102
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:29,300
Oh, no, no, no!

2103
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:32,520
Oh, gosh!

2104
01:37:32,860 --> 01:37:33,200
Lindsay!

2105
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:34,960
Lindsay, just run!

2106
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:39,400
Why does it last the whole entire time?

2107
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:40,420
It's so messed up.

2108
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,180
Oh my god, run!

2109
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:43,100
This way!

2110
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,260
Oh, I got the rune!

2111
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:52,920
Minus one!

2112
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:53,480
Minus one!

2113
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:54,260
Oh, we got the rune!

2114
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:54,880
We got the rune!

2115
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:56,480
Is there one more?

2116
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:57,000
Yeah.

2117
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,720
We finally got it.

2118
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:06,560
Yippee.

2119
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:10,280
Now we can summon things?

2120
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:20,780
A damaged engraving on the wall depicts a skeletal demon befriending the ancient Khmer people.

2121
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:24,420
To Lindsay's eye, the demon looks exactly like Paul...

2122
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:25,020
I'm sorry.

2123
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:31,900
Paul Augustine's...

2124
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,280
Augustine's undisguised self.

2125
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:37,060
It's not Jeff, it's Paul!

2126
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,800
Wait, we've seen this, though.

2127
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:42,980
I remember this, actually.

2128
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:46,500
From when we saw this mural before, I'm pretty sure.

2129
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,640
Looks just like Paul.

2130
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:53,840
That guy with his eyes closed, like, aw, man.

2131
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:58,000
I don't know.

2132
01:38:58,020 --> 01:38:59,640
That doesn't really look like befriending.

2133
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:01,000
He's destroying your buildings.

2134
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:03,460
Oh.

2135
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:08,300
Oh my gosh, that guy was still alive.

2136
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:14,560
How's our health?

2137
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:16,260
Ooh, our sanity is quite low.

2138
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:20,180
I will not accept to take your love.

2139
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:26,360
I will not accept to take your love.

2140
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:27,940
Perfect.

2141
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:33,080
I should probably get my sanity up a little bit.

2142
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,620
I don't think I can save in here.

2143
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:36,900
Nope, I didn't think so.

2144
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:42,440
I know I wanted low sanity, but I'm also scared of dying.

2145
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,880
I'm also scared of dying, you guys!

2146
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,920
I can't save in that past room because of the traps.

2147
01:39:54,980 --> 01:39:55,960
Or in here.

2148
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:06,690
What's gonna happen?

2149
01:40:06,890 --> 01:40:08,010
Is it gonna be the gas?

2150
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:15,760
It's probably gas.

2151
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:18,040
It's probably gas.

2152
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:19,360
Why can't I cartwheel?

2153
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:20,760
Just a big step, Lindsey.

2154
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:27,140
Sorry, Lindsey.

2155
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:28,120
I asked you of one...

2156
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:31,340
I asked you of one thing, okay?

2157
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:33,000
He's losing it.

2158
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:47,000
Get away from me.

2159
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:50,120
This is probably gas.

2160
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:59,120
If you proceed too far, the small dog secret is permanent.

2161
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,860
We should go back upstairs.

2162
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:03,460
Wait, where are we anyway?

2163
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:07,280
Can I loop around?

2164
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,820
Back to the staircase?

2165
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:12,600
If I go through this door down here?

2166
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:18,160
Or should I loop all... Oh wait!

2167
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:19,100
Oh, I can't!

2168
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:19,700
That's right!

2169
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:20,360
It's closed off!

2170
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,640
Okay, let's go back.

2171
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:24,920
We'll go back, we'll go back.

2172
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:27,360
Oh shoot!

2173
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:31,480
We're fine.

2174
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:32,580
You're good.

2175
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:33,440
All good, Lindsey.

2176
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:35,700
Okay.

2177
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,040
This way.

2178
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:40,540
Okay.

2179
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:42,920
Thanks for reminding me.

2180
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:46,700
I thought I would be able to do the loop like the other areas, but...

2181
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:51,620
I thought I would be able to do the loop like the other areas, but...

2182
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,040
Clearly that's not the case.

2183
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:54,600
What's this now?

2184
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:56,380
Just a wall.

2185
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:02,280
A late 50th birthday!

2186
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:04,080
A late 50th birthday!

2187
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:04,740
William, happy birthday!

2188
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:07,640
Sorry it's late.

2189
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,940
Happy birthday...

2190
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:11,640
To you...

2191
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:12,900
Ouch!

2192
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:15,700
Happy birthday...

2193
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:18,120
To you...

2194
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:19,620
Get away from me.

2195
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:21,420
Happy...

2196
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,640
Birthday, dear William...

2197
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:28,180
Happy birthday...

2198
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:28,680
Happy birthday...

2199
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:29,980
To you...

2200
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:30,960
To you...

2201
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:35,220
Sorry, the way he goes down the stairs...

2202
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:35,560
Look at this.

2203
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:41,650
Okay.

2204
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:42,750
Head back.

2205
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:46,750
This room has a guy in it.

2206
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:47,570
Doesn't it?

2207
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:48,370
Yes.

2208
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:52,070
You son of a bitch.

2209
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:52,870
You son of a bitch.

2210
01:42:53,970 --> 01:42:55,050
Oh, he's not affected.

2211
01:42:56,850 --> 01:42:57,750
Wait a second!

2212
01:42:58,330 --> 01:42:58,850
No!

2213
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:00,250
No!

2214
01:43:02,150 --> 01:43:03,410
Why do you all come back?

2215
01:43:04,590 --> 01:43:05,110
Oh.

2216
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:06,750
They're a figment of my imagination!

2217
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:11,280
Their imagination!

2218
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:12,240
Imagination!

2219
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:13,400
My sanity!

2220
01:43:16,820 --> 01:43:19,000
I can't tell if they can actually hurt me though.

2221
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,340
I wonder if I can save in here now.

2222
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:25,320
I wonder if I can save in here now.

2223
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:25,580
Oops.

2224
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:28,140
Oh, hell yeah!

2225
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:30,000
The

2226
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:38,680
ones that were dead before also were risen, I think.

2227
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:40,680
I could do it.

2228
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:40,980
Alright.

2229
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:43,100
Okay, so...

2230
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:45,820
You equip.

2231
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,980
And I enchant.

2232
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:49,860
You...

2233
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:51,200
Blue...

2234
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,420
Green is a weakness of blue?

2235
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:16,140
Oh my gosh!

2236
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,920
That's my gun.

2237
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:21,080
Hello?

2238
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:22,340
Wait, what just happened?

2239
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:24,720
Oh.

2240
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:26,960
I did the wrong thing.

2241
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:35,370
I think I enchanted.

2242
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:39,940
The wrong thing.

2243
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:46,880
It even showed up on the screen.

2244
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:49,700
It auto-equips whatever you enchant.

2245
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:52,880
It showed up on the screen and I was just like...

2246
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:53,300
La la la!

2247
01:44:57,770 --> 01:44:58,630
Oh, come on!

2248
01:45:00,990 --> 01:45:01,710
I can't!

2249
01:45:02,890 --> 01:45:04,510
Don't let him hit me!

2250
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:05,810
Help me!

2251
01:45:08,290 --> 01:45:09,050
Is he dead?

2252
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:10,470
Did I do it?

2253
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:12,830
Oh.

2254
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:19,980
Oh my gosh.

2255
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,120
They're all shooting and everything.

2256
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:24,660
Okay.

2257
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:26,000
Okay.

2258
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:28,980
I had a great idea.

2259
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:29,900
I'm watching at work right now.

2260
01:45:29,980 --> 01:45:31,400
So I'm writing this off as a work expense.

2261
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:32,040
Free money!

2262
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:34,380
Free money!

2263
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:40,940
Thanks for watching!

2264
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:42,840
Even though you're so busy.

2265
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:45,960
Thanks guys for being here.

2266
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:49,720
I know this game isn't the most popular one either but...

2267
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:51,980
I really am liking it so much.

2268
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:53,600
It's so weird.

2269
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:56,320
Okay.

2270
01:45:58,520 --> 01:45:59,100
Okay.

2271
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:00,020
Yes.

2272
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:00,500
Alright.

2273
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:01,260
Into here.

2274
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:04,900
And then...

2275
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:08,630
Oh.

2276
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:09,880
Oh.

2277
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:10,600
Oh.

2278
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:11,020
Oh.

2279
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:11,980
Oh!

2280
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:14,280
Oh gosh!

2281
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:15,300
I was hoping that wouldn't happen.

2282
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:20,700
Oh gosh!

2283
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:28,440
Wait, I don't know what that just did.

2284
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:29,960
Maybe the same thing.

2285
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:33,600
Okay, through here.

2286
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:34,720
Alright, let's go.

2287
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:38,040
I also have to learn the spell, don't I?

2288
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,640
Okay, so new spell...

2289
01:46:46,290 --> 01:46:47,390
Oh, summon?

2290
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:49,510
Summon...

2291
01:46:50,290 --> 01:46:51,370
Uh...

2292
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:54,010
Item?

2293
01:46:56,150 --> 01:46:57,490
No.

2294
01:47:01,130 --> 01:47:02,470
Summon...

2295
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:05,230
Project?

2296
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:07,950
Creature?

2297
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:13,630
Spell 6.

2298
01:47:15,630 --> 01:47:18,050
If I summon this thing, is it on my side?

2299
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:22,940
Oh my god.

2300
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:24,220
Do you guys see that fly?

2301
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:25,940
I can't...

2302
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:31,340
It's supposed to look like there's a fly on my monitor.

2303
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,420
But it's part of the game!

2304
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,320
So if I...

2305
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:38,580
It doesn't matter if I...

2306
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:43,040
If I...

2307
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,920
Do with the red one if I...

2308
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:45,520
You know, or...

2309
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:47,920
Blue or green...

2310
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,480
Does it all cast...

2311
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:51,200
Does it all summon something different?

2312
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:52,500
Oh!

2313
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:56,100
Oh my god, there's bugs all over my screen!

2314
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:57,160
Oh, they're gone now.

2315
01:48:02,450 --> 01:48:04,230
My sanity is...

2316
01:48:07,450 --> 01:48:08,710
A little crazy.

2317
01:48:12,130 --> 01:48:12,850
Wait a second.

2318
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:14,830
Before we do that...

2319
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:16,010
This looks like...

2320
01:48:16,010 --> 01:48:17,670
Okay, it looked like it was lighting up.

2321
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:19,710
Okay.

2322
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:23,610
Now we find...

2323
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:24,770
But now we go back.

2324
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:26,810
Okay, so we go down...

2325
01:48:27,370 --> 01:48:28,230
And over.

2326
01:48:28,490 --> 01:48:28,730
Okay.

2327
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:32,030
Got it, got it, got it.

2328
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:44,270
I can't go...

2329
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:45,870
Wrong way.

2330
01:48:49,390 --> 01:48:50,670
Wrong way.

2331
01:48:50,730 --> 01:48:51,950
It's hard to tell sometimes.

2332
01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:56,190
What's that sound?

2333
01:48:57,950 --> 01:48:59,150
What's squelching?

2334
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:05,890
The ceiling is bleeding?

2335
01:49:17,170 --> 01:49:19,110
It's freaking me out a little bit.

2336
01:49:19,790 --> 01:49:21,730
How low is my sanity anyway?

2337
01:49:21,890 --> 01:49:22,830
It's pretty...

2338
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:23,990
It's pretty low.

2339
01:49:28,570 --> 01:49:30,110
It's pretty low.

2340
01:49:31,450 --> 01:49:32,070
It's pretty low.

2341
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:33,310
So if I press this button...

2342
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:34,150
What is he staring at?

2343
01:49:34,930 --> 01:49:35,790
I can't.

2344
01:49:37,450 --> 01:49:39,550
It'll stop the traps for 30 seconds.

2345
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:39,890
It'll stop the traps for 30 seconds.

2346
01:49:43,150 --> 01:49:44,250
Oh, gross.

2347
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:51,020
Just checking to make sure this is the right hallway.

2348
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:52,400
It absolutely is.

2349
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:54,600
Maybe I should have tested the...

2350
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:59,020
Okay, so that was a lie.

2351
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:03,960
It absolutely did not stop the traps for 30 seconds.

2352
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:06,080
That was a lie.

2353
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:12,620
Again.

2354
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:14,200
I was slow?

2355
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:17,100
I feel like 30 seconds is a pretty long time.

2356
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:17,660
I don't know.

2357
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:21,540
There's blood squelching out of your TV.

2358
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:25,920
No!

2359
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:26,980
Okay.

2360
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:30,720
I'm gonna just try this one.

2361
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:36,380
I summoned...

2362
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:42,100
After a trapper has been summoned, press A to trap the enemy.

2363
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:45,320
When it is targeted using R.

2364
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:49,540
Press...

2365
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:50,880
What the hell is that?

2366
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:55,180
What button is that?

2367
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:57,320
To release control of the trapper.

2368
01:50:58,180 --> 01:50:59,420
Oh, the start button.

2369
01:50:59,760 --> 01:50:59,960
Okay.

2370
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:07,400
Trappers cannot open doors nor pick up items.

2371
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:28,740
What is this gonna do?

2372
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:31,220
Whoa!

2373
01:51:43,190 --> 01:51:44,830
What is this though?

2374
01:51:48,590 --> 01:51:49,070
No!

2375
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:49,550
No!

2376
01:51:49,550 --> 01:51:50,450
I can't get it though!

2377
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:58,980
I'm just a little guy.

2378
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,220
I'm just a little guy.

2379
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:04,920
I'm just a little guy.

2380
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:07,820
See ya.

2381
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:13,140
Release control!

2382
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,180
And he's activating traps.

2383
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:18,280
Wait.

2384
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:21,700
So he's not my friend though now, is he?

2385
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:23,700
He's foe?

2386
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:29,760
Oh my god.

2387
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:30,520
So I have to kill him?

2388
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:32,040
Oh my god.

2389
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:39,180
Ah!

2390
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:40,260
Ah!

2391
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:43,060
Oh my gosh.

2392
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:43,560
Ah!

2393
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:49,480
He's activating all the traps!

2394
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:52,320
He's activating all the traps!

2395
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:54,260
He's activating all the traps!

2396
01:52:57,880 --> 01:52:58,520
Se...

2397
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:04,420
Secreted inside this alcove, a rune awaits its energy silently corroding the air about it.

2398
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:07,780
Magical rune.

2399
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:13,520
Why didn't you guys at least warn me?

2400
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:14,580
What's gonna happen?

2401
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:16,400
No!

2402
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:17,640
Oh no.

2403
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:24,650
Can I do anything with it?

2404
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:25,630
Oh!

2405
01:53:25,630 --> 01:53:28,450
Oh wow, it's like a whole ass new rune!

2406
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:32,770
Protect?

2407
01:53:32,770 --> 01:53:33,630
Summon the...

2408
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:53,500
Protect.

2409
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:54,600
Protect... me.

2410
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,280
No, didn't work.

2411
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:01,760
Okay, let's just take this guy out first, I guess.

2412
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:06,780
Two... okay, he was... green.

2413
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:11,180
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

2414
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:14,020
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

2415
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,660
Warning, when you pick up rune, big guy comes out.

2416
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:21,620
New rune, protect item.

2417
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:25,960
Let's see it.

2418
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:27,800
I wanna see, I wanna see a new spell.

2419
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:31,780
Protect... item.

2420
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:38,880
No... didn't work.

2421
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,480
Oh, it didn't work.

2422
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:47,560
Oh, project!

2423
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:50,340
Can't read?

2424
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:59,040
What does it do, though?

2425
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:05,210
I don't know what it does, though.

2426
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:18,640
Enchant item with purple.

2427
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:21,900
Oh...

2428
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,740
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

2429
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:31,400
I guess I'll try it.

2430
01:55:40,990 --> 01:55:41,590
Um...

2431
01:55:43,030 --> 01:55:43,630
Please!

2432
01:55:44,630 --> 01:55:46,190
Please aim for this guy, please!

2433
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:48,990
Please!

2434
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:50,630
Why aren't you aiming?

2435
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:54,430
Oh my God.

2436
01:55:55,190 --> 01:55:55,770
Oh my God!

2437
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:56,990
Oh my God!

2438
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:57,710
Why aren't you aiming?

2439
01:56:00,650 --> 01:56:00,970
Aaaaah!

2440
01:56:03,090 --> 01:56:03,670
Oh my God.

2441
01:56:04,490 --> 01:56:05,210
I'm gonna die.

2442
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:06,230
I'm gonna die for real.

2443
01:56:07,150 --> 01:56:08,250
I'm gonna die, you guys.

2444
01:56:11,510 --> 01:56:11,830
Oh!

2445
01:56:16,610 --> 01:56:17,690
I lived!

2446
01:56:19,130 --> 01:56:24,410
How did I live?

2447
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:33,640
But there's another guy in there.

2448
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:38,200
I also like blasted that... the little thing.

2449
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:39,380
I think it's dead.

2450
01:56:44,750 --> 01:56:48,070
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

2451
01:56:58,280 --> 01:56:59,400
Are you...

2452
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:04,840
Why do you have recordings of you on the toilet, sir?

2453
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:11,520
Try to detect invisible with purple.

2454
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:13,020
Oh...

2455
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:16,080
Hold on, I'm getting my magic back up real quick.

2456
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:18,880
We're gonna heal real quick before we go take on that other dude.

2457
01:57:23,170 --> 01:57:26,790
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

2458
01:57:29,350 --> 01:57:30,650
Try to heal with purple?

2459
01:57:31,890 --> 01:57:33,590
I'm scared, I don't even know what it does!

2460
01:57:34,770 --> 01:57:36,270
I don't even know what it does!

2461
01:57:36,370 --> 01:57:37,070
Wait, what was the...

2462
01:57:37,070 --> 01:57:38,770
Oh, what's the spell for healing?

2463
01:57:40,610 --> 01:57:41,010
Recover...

2464
01:57:42,650 --> 01:57:43,450
Is a...

2465
01:57:43,930 --> 01:57:44,330
Narrow...

2466
01:57:44,330 --> 01:57:45,870
Calf and Sand Talk.

2467
01:57:46,490 --> 01:57:47,010
Okay.

2468
01:57:49,690 --> 01:57:50,210
With...

2469
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:52,850
Narrow Calf and...

2470
01:57:55,030 --> 01:57:56,030
Sand Talk.

2471
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:03,990
You don't have to recreate it?

2472
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:05,710
Oh, I like to do it!

2473
01:58:06,990 --> 01:58:07,810
Wait, so...

2474
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:08,270
Hold on.

2475
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:09,210
Oh, wait, not enchant.

2476
01:58:09,410 --> 01:58:09,930
Recover...

2477
01:58:09,930 --> 01:58:10,910
Cast...

2478
01:58:18,260 --> 01:58:18,880
Calf and Sand Talk.

2479
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,160
It got...

2480
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:19,940
It did both!

2481
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:21,560
No way.

2482
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:24,120
Mad Rock!

2483
01:58:24,740 --> 01:58:26,040
It did both!

2484
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:28,220
Oh, it did all three?

2485
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:35,860
It's cracked.

2486
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:41,300
Wait, maybe I should put that as my quick spell then, right?

2487
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:47,560
How do I do it again?

2488
01:58:47,860 --> 01:58:48,860
I'm trying to...

2489
01:58:48,860 --> 01:58:49,740
I'm pressing D-pad.

2490
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:52,320
Let's see.

2491
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:52,620
Okay.

2492
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:53,760
Spell list.

2493
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:54,420
Recover.

2494
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:55,680
Oh, assign, assign.

2495
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:57,780
You to there.

2496
01:58:57,980 --> 01:58:58,580
There we go!

2497
01:58:58,760 --> 01:58:59,020
Okay.

2498
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:00,780
We'll do the top one.

2499
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:01,560
We'll do the top one.

2500
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:02,080
Nice!

2501
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:04,840
Wait, what was that one anyway?

2502
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:08,280
Actually, I don't remember.

2503
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:18,760
I know he's in there.

2504
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:23,860
Oh, wow!

2505
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:25,540
It did a lot too!

2506
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:26,780
Holy cow!

2507
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:30,480
Okay, I still gotta get my magic up though so I can re-enchant.

2508
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:36,230
Oh, it was just enchant blue?

2509
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:36,670
Okay, okay.

2510
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:38,330
Yeah!

2511
01:59:38,510 --> 01:59:39,590
Every button is healing.

2512
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:41,550
I'll change them later, now that we have this.

2513
01:59:45,350 --> 01:59:45,750
Sorry!

2514
01:59:49,670 --> 01:59:50,530
I wasn't ready!

2515
01:59:50,610 --> 01:59:51,290
Hold on!

2516
01:59:51,410 --> 01:59:51,810
I'm not ready!

2517
01:59:52,890 --> 01:59:53,930
I'm not ready!

2518
01:59:54,050 --> 01:59:54,450
I'm not ready!

2519
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:04,380
Oh!

2520
02:00:08,740 --> 02:00:09,700
He's green.

2521
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:12,600
I did the wrong one.

2522
02:00:20,470 --> 02:00:21,310
Use purple?

2523
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:22,310
Is it really that strong?

2524
02:00:25,610 --> 02:00:26,750
Purple beats all!

2525
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:29,290
So that's what it's for!

2526
02:00:35,210 --> 02:00:36,890
So I should just purple everything then.

2527
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:44,840
Let's do here.

2528
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:48,980
Wait, why did I get rid of the top one?

2529
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:49,820
Can I only have one?

2530
02:00:50,180 --> 02:00:50,520
What?

2531
02:00:50,860 --> 02:00:51,560
That's so weird.

2532
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:55,620
Weird?

2533
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:58,100
Wait, recover, assign.

2534
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:01,120
I'll do... There we go.

2535
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:02,540
Okay, I'll just do it on Y then.

2536
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:05,340
I'll just have to remember to push it.

2537
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:09,600
I'll just have to remember to push it.

2538
02:01:10,390 --> 02:01:11,960
Okay, okay.

2539
02:01:18,150 --> 02:01:18,540
Yo!

2540
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:25,390
It's now enchanted.

2541
02:01:26,110 --> 02:01:27,090
Here I go!

2542
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:32,140
Yeah!

2543
02:01:35,490 --> 02:01:36,200
Oh shoot!

2544
02:01:38,380 --> 02:01:39,160
Reload?

2545
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:40,280
What was re...

2546
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:40,580
Oh Z!

2547
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:47,720
I only have four bullets left!

2548
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:55,180
Guys, I think this might be a mistake.

2549
02:01:57,340 --> 02:01:58,720
Okay, hold on.

2550
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:01,680
Yeah, these are... I don't think I should use this.

2551
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:02,340
Okay, hold on.

2552
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:05,980
I think I'm just gonna run for it.

2553
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:08,060
I'm gonna...

2554
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:12,860
I'm gonna... because he's all the way... I have to shoot him.

2555
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:13,680
That's the issue.

2556
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:15,400
I think I'm just gonna run for it.

2557
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:20,960
I think... because I should save it for like a final boss.

2558
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:21,920
Right?

2559
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:23,680
I think I should just...

2560
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:32,220
I think I could just run and grab it and do this and then grab whatever's in there and then run out.

2561
02:02:32,420 --> 02:02:35,940
Because he's like on his own little island, I won't be able to like run over and attack him.

2562
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:37,560
I don't need to kill him.

2563
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:38,460
Yeah, yeah, okay.

2564
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:43,880
Here we go.

2565
02:02:56,630 --> 02:02:57,310
Here we go.

2566
02:02:57,310 --> 02:02:57,650
Pick it up!

2567
02:02:57,710 --> 02:02:57,870
Pick it up!

2568
02:02:57,910 --> 02:02:58,190
Pick it up!

2569
02:02:59,430 --> 02:03:00,010
Pick it up!

2570
02:03:00,110 --> 02:03:00,330
Pick it up!

2571
02:03:00,410 --> 02:03:00,690
Pick it up!

2572
02:03:00,890 --> 02:03:01,230
Okay.

2573
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:08,590
Okay!

2574
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:11,090
Yay!

2575
02:03:14,910 --> 02:03:15,750
Oh my gosh.

2576
02:03:16,130 --> 02:03:17,050
Get me out of here.

2577
02:03:17,190 --> 02:03:17,990
How do I get out of here?

2578
02:03:18,170 --> 02:03:18,410
Alright.

2579
02:03:20,010 --> 02:03:20,350
Okay.

2580
02:03:20,350 --> 02:03:20,690
Yippee!

2581
02:03:21,070 --> 02:03:22,530
Let's go back down.

2582
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:22,930
Downstairs.

2583
02:03:23,450 --> 02:03:24,850
And continue onwards.

2584
02:03:24,890 --> 02:03:26,810
I can't even remember what we were doing.

2585
02:03:26,990 --> 02:03:27,530
Oh, shoot.

2586
02:03:32,290 --> 02:03:33,070
Oh, come on.

2587
02:03:35,470 --> 02:03:36,690
Here we go.

2588
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:40,130
Okay.

2589
02:03:40,130 --> 02:03:41,430
Okay, we got the purple!

2590
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:45,090
Gonna save... here.

2591
02:03:47,170 --> 02:03:49,650
Gosh, this... this chapter is so long.

2592
02:03:49,770 --> 02:03:51,570
I know I'm slow, but like...

2593
02:03:51,570 --> 02:03:53,450
This chapter feels mega long.

2594
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:01,160
Yay!

2595
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:02,140
Thank you!

2596
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:04,940
Thanks for five months!

2597
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:09,320
Okay.

2598
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,340
It's here.

2599
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:12,660
Here?

2600
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:15,680
Yeah.

2601
02:04:20,770 --> 02:04:21,170
Okay.

2602
02:04:22,130 --> 02:04:23,670
Run, Lindsay!

2603
02:04:23,830 --> 02:04:24,310
Run!

2604
02:04:25,710 --> 02:04:26,970
Where are we going?

2605
02:04:27,690 --> 02:04:28,090
Okay.

2606
02:04:28,290 --> 02:04:29,850
We have to go through the loop.

2607
02:04:30,290 --> 02:04:31,770
We didn't get to the end of the hallway.

2608
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:33,430
Okay.

2609
02:04:34,390 --> 02:04:34,790
Alright.

2610
02:04:35,210 --> 02:04:35,570
Alright.

2611
02:04:37,110 --> 02:04:37,990
Oh, come on.

2612
02:04:39,290 --> 02:04:39,690
Ah!

2613
02:04:40,110 --> 02:04:40,510
Gosh!

2614
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:41,150
Just run!

2615
02:04:51,630 --> 02:04:52,430
No worries.

2616
02:04:52,630 --> 02:04:53,650
Get away from me.

2617
02:04:54,230 --> 02:04:54,850
Oh my gosh.

2618
02:04:54,930 --> 02:04:55,390
Oh, just go!

2619
02:04:55,450 --> 02:04:56,030
Just go for it!

2620
02:04:56,970 --> 02:04:57,730
I'm going...

2621
02:04:57,730 --> 02:04:58,710
Just go for it!

2622
02:05:01,610 --> 02:05:03,750
I'm a master at dodging.

2623
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:04,930
No worries, everybody.

2624
02:05:05,230 --> 02:05:06,030
We're all good.

2625
02:05:06,810 --> 02:05:07,490
Oh.

2626
02:05:10,490 --> 02:05:11,170
Wow!

2627
02:05:11,510 --> 02:05:14,690
That takes a lot of magic.

2628
02:05:14,790 --> 02:05:15,430
Good to know.

2629
02:05:16,190 --> 02:05:17,770
Yeah, Lindsay's a champ.

2630
02:05:17,910 --> 02:05:18,850
He just takes it.

2631
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:23,190
He really just like... eats those blades.

2632
02:05:23,630 --> 02:05:24,710
He's like...

2633
02:05:27,190 --> 02:05:29,050
Can't stop me now.

2634
02:05:30,550 --> 02:05:31,290
That's him.

2635
02:05:31,470 --> 02:05:32,950
He's really once... What's that guy?

2636
02:05:33,110 --> 02:05:34,130
Jeremy or whatever?

2637
02:05:34,490 --> 02:05:35,710
He's really...

2638
02:05:37,270 --> 02:05:39,610
He's just like... If you wrong me...

2639
02:05:40,290 --> 02:05:42,090
You're gonna get Lindsay'd.

2640
02:05:47,590 --> 02:05:48,830
No, not Jeff.

2641
02:05:49,130 --> 02:05:50,350
That's the name I made up.

2642
02:05:54,570 --> 02:05:55,230
Oh, gosh.

2643
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:03,000
Okay.

2644
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:04,520
Oh.

2645
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:06,080
Okay.

2646
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:09,840
Onwards.

2647
02:06:13,220 --> 02:06:13,740
Rude.

2648
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:15,160
So rude.

2649
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:19,140
How did the people who lived here get through this?

2650
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:24,560
They clearly knew how to use their legs and take big steps.

2651
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:25,680
Or something.

2652
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:29,100
Lindsay's the problem.

2653
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:31,120
This is gonna open up, isn't it?

2654
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:34,220
To another staircase or something, maybe?

2655
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:36,600
There's a reason they all died?

2656
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:38,440
No!

2657
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:41,440
Okay.

2658
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,060
This one activates wood.

2659
02:06:50,420 --> 02:06:51,540
Run, Lindsay, run.

2660
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:54,820
Okay.

2661
02:06:55,220 --> 02:06:56,460
I can't forget English.

2662
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:57,740
How far we've gotten.

2663
02:06:57,780 --> 02:06:58,660
How many hallways.

2664
02:06:58,660 --> 02:06:59,380
We've been through.

2665
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:00,160
How many everything.

2666
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,620
So now...

2667
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:04,840
Yes.

2668
02:07:04,940 --> 02:07:05,120
Okay.

2669
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:09,060
What's this gonna activate, you think?

2670
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:10,620
What's this one?

2671
02:07:15,380 --> 02:07:16,160
Okie dokie.

2672
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:20,460
And then this one activates a bunch of stuff, doesn't it?

2673
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:23,020
Shoo.

2674
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:24,740
Shoo.

2675
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:25,660
Shoo.

2676
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:26,580
Shoo.

2677
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:27,500
Shoo.

2678
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:28,400
Shoo.

2679
02:07:28,820 --> 02:07:29,280
Shoo.

2680
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:31,280
Phew.

2681
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:33,880
What's this one gonna activate?

2682
02:07:36,140 --> 02:07:37,900
Oh, come on.

2683
02:07:48,180 --> 02:07:49,840
What's this one gonna activate?

2684
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:53,900
I think they got faster.

2685
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:57,200
I died.

2686
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:57,220
I died.

2687
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:06,880
You!

2688
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:08,640
Activate...

2689
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:09,480
This!

2690
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:18,100
My blade is now enchanted and run.

2691
02:08:20,620 --> 02:08:21,840
I was not close enough.

2692
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:22,400
Oh my gosh.

2693
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:23,440
There's so many guys in here.

2694
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:27,180
Oh my gosh.

2695
02:08:27,180 --> 02:08:27,180
There's so many guys in here.

2696
02:08:27,180 --> 02:08:27,380
Oh my gosh.

2697
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:28,060
There's so many.

2698
02:08:28,140 --> 02:08:28,340
Ew.

2699
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:29,620
It's just squelching everywhere.

2700
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:32,420
It's just only squelch.

2701
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:36,420
It's just squelching.

2702
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:38,000
Non-stop squelching.

2703
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:38,560
Get in a line.

2704
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:40,140
Get in a line.

2705
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:40,700
Get in a line.

2706
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:43,040
Get in a line.

2707
02:08:43,140 --> 02:08:43,600
Get in a line.

2708
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:47,380
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

2709
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:49,420
Oh.

2710
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:51,380
What's...

2711
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:51,960
What's happening?

2712
02:08:52,660 --> 02:08:53,660
What's going on with them?

2713
02:08:54,260 --> 02:08:54,660
Ah!

2714
02:08:55,340 --> 02:08:56,140
What are they doing?

2715
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:56,140
What are you doing?

2716
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:57,460
No, no, no, no!

2717
02:08:57,620 --> 02:08:58,320
What are you doing?

2718
02:08:58,500 --> 02:08:59,560
No, no, no, no!

2719
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,060
What just happened?

2720
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:06,020
Oh, the blue ones explode.

2721
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:08,640
I don't think I got hurt though.

2722
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:14,260
Hold on, I'm not ready yet.

2723
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:16,740
My camera is shaking and it's annoying.

2724
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:23,660
Okay, let's recover sanity because my camera is annoying me.

2725
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:28,140
Yeah, I saw the scroll.

2726
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:28,680
Don't worry.

2727
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:31,360
Squelches menacingly.

2728
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:34,680
It's still... it's still...

2729
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:39,500
Come on, Lindsey.

2730
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:40,020
Get it together.

2731
02:09:40,140 --> 02:09:40,820
Get it together, man.

2732
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:42,300
We're fine.

2733
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:46,760
Okay, we're fine now.

2734
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:50,720
Okay, let's grab this.

2735
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:52,020
Wait.

2736
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:55,640
A scroll of paper sits upon a ledge circling the...

2737
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:58,560
The dais at the center of the room.

2738
02:09:59,580 --> 02:10:00,800
Oh, I have to pick it up.

2739
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:04,460
They can sink and all explode at once.

2740
02:10:05,480 --> 02:10:08,260
It's a big enough blast to kill you anywhere in the room?

2741
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:09,600
That's what got me.

2742
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:10,000
No way.

2743
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:11,560
Deus.

2744
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:14,920
Summon trapper.

2745
02:10:15,120 --> 02:10:15,460
Oh.

2746
02:10:17,220 --> 02:10:17,820
Okay, good.

2747
02:10:17,900 --> 02:10:20,840
I thought that was going to activate like a trap in this room.

2748
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:22,580
Wouldn't be the first time.

2749
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:30,400
Yeah, the spell I learned myself.

2750
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:32,000
Uh-huh.

2751
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,800
I'm already smarter than you, game...

2752
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:34,360
Oh, come on.

2753
02:10:36,940 --> 02:10:38,360
The shaking is annoying.

2754
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:41,480
My sanity is not even that low.

2755
02:10:41,580 --> 02:10:42,560
Why am I so...

2756
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,820
Why am I so wiggly?

2757
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:46,540
Why am I so wiggly?

2758
02:10:51,450 --> 02:10:53,970
You are sad, Zelda.

2759
02:10:54,710 --> 02:10:55,730
You are sad, Zelda.

2760
02:10:55,730 --> 02:10:58,030
You are sad, Zelda.

2761
02:10:58,030 --> 02:10:58,290
You are sad, Zelda.

2762
02:10:58,290 --> 02:10:58,410
Huh.

2763
02:10:59,410 --> 02:11:01,330
I don't think that's a sanity effect.

2764
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:07,710
Lindsay finds this mural frighteningly familiar.

2765
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:10,810
It is the scene he saw in the Tome of Eternal Darkness.

2766
02:11:11,150 --> 02:11:16,030
The fertility god must be Manturok, and this temple must be its tomb.

2767
02:11:18,850 --> 02:11:19,490
Yes!

2768
02:11:21,090 --> 02:11:21,730
Yes!

2769
02:11:21,730 --> 02:11:23,670
So we were here!

2770
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:26,310
We were here!

2771
02:11:28,290 --> 02:11:28,930
Guys, remember?

2772
02:11:30,390 --> 02:11:31,270
Purple text.

2773
02:11:31,570 --> 02:11:32,810
Yeah, purple text.

2774
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:41,240
Interesting.

2775
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:45,700
Yeah, I don't know.

2776
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:48,460
I didn't really get fertility, but...

2777
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:51,400
You know.

2778
02:11:53,620 --> 02:11:56,560
That... whatever floats your boat, you know?

2779
02:11:58,560 --> 02:11:59,460
Oh, that's a tree.

2780
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:01,720
I was like, how was I able to save when there's a body in here?

2781
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:03,820
Alright, onward.

2782
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:11,300
If the fertility goddess needs a Manturok, I will be that man.

2783
02:12:13,780 --> 02:12:14,860
Wait, this is...

2784
02:12:14,860 --> 02:12:17,040
Wait, isn't this where Manturok is?

2785
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:18,800
Yes!

2786
02:12:19,420 --> 02:12:21,160
Wait, what's gonna be down here?

2787
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:26,200
Oh.

2788
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:29,100
He's still down here.

2789
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:32,100
Hello!

2790
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:33,980
Hey!

2791
02:12:34,140 --> 02:12:34,980
Don't mind me!

2792
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:37,840
Hi!

2793
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:48,040
You've been... how long has it been?

2794
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:51,300
Hi!

2795
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:53,960
Oh my gosh!

2796
02:12:54,140 --> 02:12:57,000
Are you looking for a goddess of fertility?

2797
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:02,680
The power of Mantarok is not easily controlled.

2798
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:05,500
What makes you think I want to control it?

2799
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:09,200
Arrogant man.

2800
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:11,060
Kill him!

2801
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:11,640
What?

2802
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:13,860
Make sure you succeed this time.

2803
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:14,540
Oh, come on.

2804
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:21,840
Mantarok's on my side.

2805
02:13:24,660 --> 02:13:25,320
Yeah.

2806
02:13:26,160 --> 02:13:27,480
Get rocked.

2807
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:32,040
No!

2808
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:33,880
I have a torch.

2809
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:36,700
The darkness is not coming.

2810
02:13:37,660 --> 02:13:40,040
This guy is so calm right now.

2811
02:13:40,220 --> 02:13:41,120
Holy cow.

2812
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:49,320
Thank you for opening that up for me.

2813
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:53,620
Is Mantarok on my side?

2814
02:13:57,790 --> 02:13:58,430
Hot lady.

2815
02:14:04,290 --> 02:14:04,610
Okay.

2816
02:14:06,090 --> 02:14:07,510
Wait, can I... Oh, dang it.

2817
02:14:07,530 --> 02:14:09,450
I was going to see if I could walk on top of Mantarok.

2818
02:14:10,130 --> 02:14:10,670
Wait, hold on.

2819
02:14:10,810 --> 02:14:13,590
I want to also... There was like another statue on this side too though, right?

2820
02:14:14,410 --> 02:14:14,910
Oops, sorry.

2821
02:14:14,950 --> 02:14:16,410
I'm walking on top of you a little bit.

2822
02:14:18,830 --> 02:14:19,150
Oh.

2823
02:14:22,690 --> 02:14:24,550
What happened to you, my goddess?

2824
02:14:26,490 --> 02:14:27,370
Oh my god.

2825
02:14:27,370 --> 02:14:30,090
What happened to you?

2826
02:14:30,850 --> 02:14:32,350
She's all legs.

2827
02:14:35,170 --> 02:14:37,090
She's all legs.

2828
02:14:37,610 --> 02:14:38,870
The feet goddess.

2829
02:14:39,190 --> 02:14:42,150
I mean, when I say goddess of fertility, I'm just saying.

2830
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:54,100
Oh my gosh!

2831
02:14:54,480 --> 02:15:01,080
Do not touch the heart, flesh, and bone, lest you become like me, a dead, rotted husk.

2832
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:05,060
I have waited many centuries for you.

2833
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:08,820
It was not easy hiding from the Dark Ones as they searched for me.

2834
02:15:08,980 --> 02:15:13,640
At first they passed by, not thinking that the heart was inside my dead body.

2835
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:16,200
But I was forced to find refuge here.

2836
02:15:16,740 --> 02:15:23,160
You must seal the heart, so it never contacts your flesh, and take it to the Gathering of Light.

2837
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:26,980
A museum!

2838
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:28,440
It belongs in a museum!

2839
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:31,780
Or the world shall fall under a rain of eternal darkness.

2840
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:33,800
Eternal darkness.

2841
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:34,700
She said the thing.

2842
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:40,040
The veil of reality can only be pulled back so far, Myrtle.

2843
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:43,140
Take your stand and fight the darkness.

2844
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:48,460
She's gone.

2845
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:51,860
She's gone.

2846
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:53,160
Okay.

2847
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:54,400
Don't touch it.

2848
02:15:55,460 --> 02:15:57,020
It's gotta be sealed.

2849
02:15:57,020 --> 02:15:57,740
Oh no!

2850
02:15:58,020 --> 02:15:58,120
Oh!

2851
02:16:01,580 --> 02:16:02,200
That's it?

2852
02:16:03,740 --> 02:16:05,000
Is that my grandpa?

2853
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:06,280
Wait a second.

2854
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:07,720
That's my grandpa!

2855
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:10,620
Where is he putting it?

2856
02:16:11,420 --> 02:16:13,040
Oh, now we're gonna know where it's at.

2857
02:16:16,420 --> 02:16:17,320
It's behind!

2858
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:23,800
I see!

2859
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:24,440
Oh!

2860
02:16:24,580 --> 02:16:25,580
We finished the chapter!

2861
02:16:25,580 --> 02:16:28,380
Wait, there wasn't even a boss fight!

2862
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:29,840
We did it!

2863
02:16:33,020 --> 02:16:34,300
Grandpa's a little freaky.

2864
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:40,240
No one would ever check that book.

2865
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:41,600
Clearly.

2866
02:16:43,540 --> 02:16:44,840
My little girl.

2867
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:46,860
My little girl.

2868
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:48,740
Oh, why was it green?

2869
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:54,600
Let's restore my... I'm scared most of... actually...

2870
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:56,800
No, I won't restore my sanity.

2871
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:58,240
We're a little tilted, but...

2872
02:16:58,740 --> 02:17:02,340
I'm mostly scared of sanity in here because I feel safe in this area.

2873
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:06,960
But I know I shouldn't feel safe in this area because, you know...

2874
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:10,800
The boss is the purple spell.

2875
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:11,400
Truly.

2876
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:13,260
Save?

2877
02:17:13,520 --> 02:17:15,800
I think it saves automatically, but I will save...

2878
02:17:17,700 --> 02:17:19,180
Oh, it didn't save.

2879
02:17:21,620 --> 02:17:22,880
Hey, save fellas!

2880
02:17:23,060 --> 02:17:25,040
Did someone mention the door to darkness?

2881
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:28,140
Did someone mention the eternal darkness?

2882
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:29,180
Haha!

2883
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:30,480
Pukwa Mickey!

2884
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:33,320
No auto-saves.

2885
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:35,100
Okay.

2886
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:41,220
I say I feel safe here, but it's also so freaky in here.

2887
02:17:41,460 --> 02:17:42,780
Actually, I don't know where I feel.

2888
02:17:42,860 --> 02:17:44,220
I feel... I miss my torch.

2889
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:48,980
I miss my torch and I miss my shotgun.

2890
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:50,980
Actually, I feel very naked right now.

2891
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:52,920
I don't feel safe at all.

2892
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:53,920
Ah!

2893
02:17:54,760 --> 02:17:55,520
Ah!

2894
02:17:57,560 --> 02:17:59,140
Okay, grandpa...

2895
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:01,880
Grandpa?

2896
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:04,440
Huh?

2897
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:08,940
I know... I know where I sent...

2898
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:12,760
Oh?

2899
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:14,520
Grandpa?

2900
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:18,140
Can that hurt us?

2901
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:19,760
Um...

2902
02:18:20,580 --> 02:18:21,440
What is it doing?

2903
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:22,920
Oh, it's gone.

2904
02:18:23,160 --> 02:18:24,380
Oh, it was here the whole time.

2905
02:18:24,680 --> 02:18:27,860
No one would check this book that's sideways.

2906
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:30,080
Edwin H.

2907
02:18:30,260 --> 02:18:30,500
Lindsay!

2908
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:35,420
The demon in the Khmer.

2909
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:45,900
Alex discovers a pulp novel written by one Dr. Edwin Lindsay amongst the books on the shelf.

2910
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:51,420
This is where the tomb of eternal darkness indicated that something of value was hidden behind the shelf.

2911
02:18:51,420 --> 02:18:52,340
This book.

2912
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:54,140
Should Alex look behind the book?

2913
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:55,100
Yes.

2914
02:18:56,940 --> 02:18:57,500
Ah!

2915
02:18:57,860 --> 02:18:59,420
It's just chilling there.

2916
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:00,000
Oh my gosh.

2917
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:02,960
With the book removed, a secret cache is revealed.

2918
02:19:03,260 --> 02:19:05,700
Inside is the heart of Mantarok.

2919
02:19:05,900 --> 02:19:07,500
It's just been chilling here this whole time.

2920
02:19:07,960 --> 02:19:11,180
Encased in glass to protect the world from its corrosive energies.

2921
02:19:11,460 --> 02:19:14,200
Should Alex claim the heart of Mantarok?

2922
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:17,040
Um...

2923
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:17,960
Sure.

2924
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:20,040
I'm sure.

2925
02:19:20,840 --> 02:19:21,400
It's a secret.

2926
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:24,840
And then...

2927
02:19:24,840 --> 02:19:25,120
I guess.

2928
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:29,020
What in the beauty and the beast.

2929
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:31,240
Oh my gosh.

2930
02:19:43,830 --> 02:19:47,730
I don't like this, I don't like this, I don't like this, I don't like this, I don't like this..

2931
02:19:56,970 --> 02:19:59,090
These are very... these are really creepy.

2932
02:20:07,110 --> 02:20:10,530
I'm also kind of getting tired of the Dutch angle, I'm not gonna lie.

2933
02:20:12,950 --> 02:20:14,170
Keep it low, you coward!

2934
02:20:14,290 --> 02:20:14,890
Yeah, I'm a coward!

2935
02:20:17,770 --> 02:20:18,490
It's scary!

2936
02:20:18,770 --> 02:20:19,170
It's scary!

2937
02:20:20,330 --> 02:20:21,250
Is the book gone?

2938
02:20:23,270 --> 02:20:25,790
I guess that was just my sanity.

2939
02:20:26,930 --> 02:20:28,310
So now we have...

2940
02:20:30,070 --> 02:20:30,510
this.

2941
02:20:42,270 --> 02:20:44,290
But my sanity effects... okay.

2942
02:20:44,870 --> 02:20:46,970
I'll let my sanity go back down, you guys.

2943
02:20:47,070 --> 02:20:47,770
I'll bring them back.

2944
02:20:48,010 --> 02:20:49,370
I was just scared, okay?

2945
02:20:49,890 --> 02:20:50,850
I was scared.

2946
02:20:51,250 --> 02:20:53,390
There was somebody walking and freaking me out.

2947
02:20:54,010 --> 02:20:55,510
So what do I do with this thing now?

2948
02:20:57,970 --> 02:20:59,690
I'm gonna codec my grandpa.

2949
02:21:00,310 --> 02:21:00,910
Grandpa!

2950
02:21:02,970 --> 02:21:05,970
So I have to use it to find...

2951
02:21:07,290 --> 02:21:08,870
the next chapter.

2952
02:21:24,970 --> 02:21:29,390
Let's go back this way, see if anything else changes.

2953
02:21:29,930 --> 02:21:32,310
There's still... I think it's this room.

2954
02:21:33,290 --> 02:21:35,570
Yeah, this room is...

2955
02:21:37,010 --> 02:21:38,290
a mystery...

2956
02:21:39,370 --> 02:21:40,250
for me.

2957
02:21:40,950 --> 02:21:42,950
There's so many levers and...

2958
02:21:46,630 --> 02:21:47,270
everything.

2959
02:21:53,110 --> 02:21:56,470
I did learn a new spell, that is true, but...

2960
02:21:57,150 --> 02:21:58,910
I don't think that this...

2961
02:21:58,910 --> 02:22:02,290
I have a feeling, I have an inkling that the spell doesn't...

2962
02:22:03,790 --> 02:22:04,190
isn't...

2963
02:22:05,630 --> 02:22:06,530
what's gonna help.

2964
02:22:06,930 --> 02:22:07,330
Because...

2965
02:22:07,330 --> 02:22:08,470
that seemed...

2966
02:22:09,030 --> 02:22:09,430
optional.

2967
02:22:10,330 --> 02:22:10,870
You know?

2968
02:22:14,820 --> 02:22:19,140
I feel like it seemed optional, because...

2969
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:20,420
What?

2970
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:20,900
What other?

2971
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:21,520
Wait, hold on.

2972
02:22:21,800 --> 02:22:23,200
We have Manta Rock, but what else?

2973
02:22:23,300 --> 02:22:23,760
Wait, hold on.

2974
02:22:24,440 --> 02:22:25,420
We have the summon?

2975
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:28,080
We can summon a... something?

2976
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:29,300
We can summon a trapper?

2977
02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:32,800
And we also have the dispel one.

2978
02:22:33,320 --> 02:22:33,720
Okay.

2979
02:22:34,700 --> 02:22:35,740
Which one was that?

2980
02:22:36,220 --> 02:22:36,940
Dispel magic?

2981
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:39,820
That one's new too.

2982
02:22:40,780 --> 02:22:41,740
Wasn't there...

2983
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:43,940
a seal somewhere?

2984
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:47,160
I got rid of the one in here.

2985
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:52,940
The second floor window!

2986
02:22:53,160 --> 02:22:53,840
Yes, thank you!

2987
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:54,620
That's where it was!

2988
02:22:54,940 --> 02:22:55,840
Yes, yes, yes!

2989
02:22:56,880 --> 02:22:57,720
Okay, okay, okay.

2990
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:02,520
Summoning other colors?

2991
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:03,860
Yeah, I wanna see if...

2992
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:05,680
Not just a trapper, but...

2993
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:07,240
Yeah, the window over here.

2994
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:08,860
That horse.

2995
02:23:13,540 --> 02:23:14,140
This...

2996
02:23:14,140 --> 02:23:14,880
Yes!

2997
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:20,520
Red!

2998
02:23:33,060 --> 02:23:34,040
Goodbye, wall.

2999
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:43,780
As the magical window fades away, the piece of parchment that the maiden was holding is left behind, floating in mid-air.

3000
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:44,140
It's like...

3001
02:23:44,140 --> 02:23:46,520
It appears to be a chapter page.

3002
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:48,560
Take it?

3003
02:23:48,660 --> 02:23:48,840
Yeah.

3004
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:50,520
Heresy!

3005
02:24:02,150 --> 02:24:02,910
Heresy!

3006
02:24:02,950 --> 02:24:03,390
Heresy!

3007
02:24:03,530 --> 02:24:03,930
Heresy!

3008
02:24:08,530 --> 02:24:11,390
And this guy's like in my basement.

3009
02:24:12,790 --> 02:24:13,550
So...

3010
02:24:13,550 --> 02:24:13,850
So...

3011
02:24:13,850 --> 02:24:14,610
So...

3012
02:24:15,010 --> 02:24:15,390
So...

3013
02:24:16,090 --> 02:24:16,470
So...

3014
02:24:17,170 --> 02:24:17,550
So...

3015
02:24:18,070 --> 02:24:18,450
So...

3016
02:24:19,190 --> 02:24:19,890
So...

3017
02:24:19,890 --> 02:24:20,070
You are...

3018
02:24:30,970 --> 02:24:32,000
Not in my basement.

3019
02:24:35,380 --> 02:24:36,220
Me too.

3020
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:39,980
I am not your food today.

3021
02:24:40,300 --> 02:24:41,800
I am your master.

3022
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:42,160
Oh!

3023
02:24:42,340 --> 02:24:45,500
Your task is to guard the artifact before you.

3024
02:24:46,040 --> 02:24:48,200
Let no one touch it.

3025
02:24:54,220 --> 02:24:54,840
Oh...

3026
02:24:57,140 --> 02:24:59,560
Oh, he part-gone too hard, you guys.

3027
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:02,180
Oh, this is our chance!

3028
02:25:02,420 --> 02:25:02,880
We can leave!

3029
02:25:03,980 --> 02:25:05,080
What are you looking at?

3030
02:25:06,480 --> 02:25:06,960
Just...

3031
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:07,940
Just jump!

3032
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:08,980
Let's get out of here!

3033
02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:12,440
Who cares what's going on?

3034
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:13,040
Wait.

3035
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:14,020
Also this.

3036
02:25:18,190 --> 02:25:19,550
We know there's a room here.

3037
02:25:20,650 --> 02:25:21,790
Do we have...

3038
02:25:21,790 --> 02:25:23,510
We have the summon thing.

3039
02:25:23,630 --> 02:25:24,130
Will it work?

3040
02:25:24,490 --> 02:25:25,610
Reveal invisible, maybe?

3041
02:25:38,890 --> 02:25:39,370
Oh.

3042
02:25:40,170 --> 02:25:40,290
We got shot.

3043
02:25:41,490 --> 02:25:43,210
We went in that room in the past.

3044
02:25:43,310 --> 02:25:43,610
I remember.

3045
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:52,460
Oh, with Venture Rocket makes me invisible?

3046
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:53,560
Wait.

3047
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:53,800
Really?

3048
02:25:57,050 --> 02:25:58,030
I'm see-through.

3049
02:26:00,630 --> 02:26:01,770
For how long?

3050
02:26:02,810 --> 02:26:03,330
Wait.

3051
02:26:03,390 --> 02:26:03,990
For how long?

3052
02:26:15,320 --> 02:26:15,840
Hello?

3053
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:18,180
I'm a ghost?

3054
02:26:19,180 --> 02:26:19,860
For real?

3055
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:23,280
I'm actually a ghost?

3056
02:26:25,660 --> 02:26:26,100
Alright.

3057
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:26,640
Oh.

3058
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:28,240
I guess I didn't have to come back in here.

3059
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:31,600
It just feels proper to read the chapter in here, you know?

3060
02:26:37,700 --> 02:26:38,940
Journal of M.

3061
02:26:39,180 --> 02:26:40,440
Roivas P...

3062
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:40,800
Oh, wait.

3063
02:26:41,220 --> 02:26:41,900
Wrong one.

3064
02:26:47,780 --> 02:26:50,420
Like, when you hover over the page, it's like...

3065
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:54,380
Should Alex read it now?

3066
02:26:55,020 --> 02:26:55,460
No.

3067
02:26:55,460 --> 02:26:57,340
What it says?

3068
02:27:00,360 --> 02:27:01,760
What is it?

3069
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:02,300
Oh, oh.

3070
02:27:10,700 --> 02:27:13,500
Poor boy.

3071
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:16,200
Oh.

3072
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:23,460
Poor boy.

3073
02:27:24,100 --> 02:27:24,800
Oh.

3074
02:27:41,220 --> 02:27:41,700
1485.

3075
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:43,260
Wait, we went back in time.

3076
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:44,480
Well,

3077
02:27:47,700 --> 02:27:49,040
they did say the Inquisition, but...

3078
02:27:50,020 --> 02:27:51,940
Oh, you don't look okay.

3079
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:56,820
I didn't realize we were going to go so back in time, I guess.

3080
02:28:02,380 --> 02:28:02,780
Okay.

3081
02:28:15,340 --> 02:28:16,600
Guy's not looking so good.

3082
02:28:20,020 --> 02:28:20,420
Brother?

3083
02:28:25,860 --> 02:28:27,820
Oh, you're giving me a back massage?

3084
02:28:28,100 --> 02:28:28,700
What is this?

3085
02:28:29,620 --> 02:28:32,200
Amiens appears to be a peaceful hamlet.

3086
02:28:32,540 --> 02:28:34,300
It appears to be.

3087
02:28:34,620 --> 02:28:41,940
But deviancy is secreted in the most deceptive places, which I believe is the case with Amiens.

3088
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:44,660
Then I wish you luck in your search.

3089
02:28:45,140 --> 02:28:48,480
The Inquisition does not need luck, Brother Luther.

3090
02:28:49,020 --> 02:28:52,120
Faith and purity are our guides.

3091
02:28:55,220 --> 02:28:55,620
Oh...

3092
02:29:00,730 --> 02:29:02,290
Okay, I was just trying to be nice.

3093
02:29:02,330 --> 02:29:03,430
You don't have to be a jerk about it.

3094
02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:08,150
I have a meditation rod.

3095
02:29:08,270 --> 02:29:09,430
What the heck does this do?

3096
02:29:10,010 --> 02:29:15,410
The priest's meditation rod is a small staff used as a focus for meditative powers.

3097
02:29:16,030 --> 02:29:16,590
Oh, sorry.

3098
02:29:16,670 --> 02:29:16,850
Prayer.

3099
02:29:18,930 --> 02:29:22,830
Using it will allow Paul to meditate and regain some lost sanity.

3100
02:29:24,170 --> 02:29:27,070
I don't think Paul is going to wield a gun, is he?

3101
02:29:29,950 --> 02:29:30,750
I

3102
02:29:36,530 --> 02:29:38,450
have a feeling Paul is...

3103
02:29:50,160 --> 02:29:50,960
Whoa.

3104
02:29:51,460 --> 02:29:53,480
Wait, where was all the singing coming from?

3105
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:57,180
Okay, spooky.

3106
02:29:59,700 --> 02:30:01,120
Crunchy PBJ!

3107
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:03,880
Thank you so much!

3108
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:05,820
Thank you!

3109
02:30:07,380 --> 02:30:09,780
For the love of God!

3110
02:30:10,060 --> 02:30:10,860
Guards!

3111
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:11,620
Help!

3112
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:13,060
Come quickly!

3113
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:16,880
Uh-oh.

3114
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:20,460
They're looking mighty suspicious.

3115
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:21,340
A murder!

3116
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:22,760
A murder most foul!

3117
02:30:23,060 --> 02:30:24,380
What heresy is this?

3118
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:27,440
I... I found him lying here.

3119
02:30:27,580 --> 02:30:28,040
Heresy!

3120
02:30:28,220 --> 02:30:28,660
Heresy!

3121
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:30,600
I called the guards.

3122
02:30:32,100 --> 02:30:34,300
Is this our first suspect?

3123
02:30:34,660 --> 02:30:35,260
What?

3124
02:30:35,340 --> 02:30:36,420
Make sure no one touches the body.

3125
02:30:36,420 --> 02:30:37,040
I just got here!

3126
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:39,380
He must be examined for signs of devilry.

3127
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:40,320
Devilry.

3128
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:42,000
As for this man...

3129
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:42,340
Oh.

3130
02:30:42,340 --> 02:30:44,460
Make sure he doesn't leave the cathedral.

3131
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:46,600
I will question him later.

3132
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:47,020
I'm sorry.

3133
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:47,420
What?

3134
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:49,700
Says the guy that literally looks like a snake.

3135
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:50,340
Hold up, Tom.

3136
02:30:50,340 --> 02:30:51,720
Or it might bring my wrath upon thee.

3137
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:55,140
Who is to say that you did not commit this murder?

3138
02:30:55,540 --> 02:31:01,380
If you trust in the Almighty, and you are indeed innocent, then you will have nothing to fear.

3139
02:31:01,820 --> 02:31:02,580
Can you speak up?

3140
02:31:08,900 --> 02:31:10,000
Are they gonna...

3141
02:31:10,600 --> 02:31:12,300
Wait, they literally locked me away.

3142
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:14,660
What is this?

3143
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:16,980
I didn't get to go upstairs.

3144
02:31:18,820 --> 02:31:20,980
The painting captures Paul's attention.

3145
02:31:21,300 --> 02:31:23,720
A small emerald disguised as part of the painting.

3146
02:31:24,100 --> 02:31:28,000
Glints in the candlelight, as though it has some value beyond being a precious gem.

3147
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:29,940
Paul!

3148
02:31:31,740 --> 02:31:32,740
That's devilish!

3149
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:34,600
You're gonna steal from the church?

3150
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:37,540
This is one of the best chapters in the game.

3151
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:38,500
I'm excited.

3152
02:31:39,780 --> 02:31:40,280
Paul!

3153
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:41,140
Paul!

3154
02:31:41,140 --> 02:31:41,320
Paul!

3155
02:31:41,320 --> 02:31:41,400
Paul!

3156
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:41,420
Paul!

3157
02:31:41,420 --> 02:31:41,620
Paul!

3158
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:43,340
Very good.

3159
02:31:43,340 --> 02:31:43,540
Joink!

3160
02:31:51,850 --> 02:31:54,450
Are you here to pass sentence on me?

3161
02:31:54,610 --> 02:31:54,890
No.

3162
02:31:55,590 --> 02:31:57,310
I'm here to free you.

3163
02:31:57,550 --> 02:32:00,030
You are in incredible danger.

3164
02:32:00,430 --> 02:32:03,710
This cathedral used to be a place of peace.

3165
02:32:04,130 --> 02:32:04,590
What happened?

3166
02:32:04,790 --> 02:32:07,550
Now many strange things happen here.

3167
02:32:07,750 --> 02:32:08,170
Oh, yeah.

3168
02:32:08,490 --> 02:32:11,070
I don't want you to end up like the others.

3169
02:32:11,270 --> 02:32:12,150
What do you mean?

3170
02:32:12,470 --> 02:32:13,550
The look on his face is so funny.

3171
02:32:13,570 --> 02:32:16,290
The body you found was Brother Andrew.

3172
02:32:16,570 --> 02:32:18,390
And he was killed.

3173
02:32:18,390 --> 02:32:18,450
You're the one who killed him!

3174
02:32:31,730 --> 02:32:33,250
A secret.

3175
02:32:33,930 --> 02:32:33,950
Yeah.

3176
02:32:50,050 --> 02:32:51,290
So true.

3177
02:32:56,490 --> 02:33:03,790
Oh my gosh, it's Slender.

3178
02:33:05,230 --> 02:33:11,970
I have to collect the seven pages.

3179
02:33:13,090 --> 02:33:14,050
Okay.

3180
02:33:19,410 --> 02:33:19,890
Okay.

3181
02:33:20,030 --> 02:33:21,650
Is this a sneaking mission?

3182
02:33:26,010 --> 02:33:26,970
Is this...

3183
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:35,360
Am I gonna have to sneak past the guys?

3184
02:33:35,740 --> 02:33:36,340
What's this one?

3185
02:33:37,320 --> 02:33:38,880
Oh, I can barely even see it.

3186
02:33:50,140 --> 02:33:50,820
Sorry.

3187
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:53,000
Is this the face of a holy man?

3188
02:33:55,940 --> 02:33:56,780
What's this?

3189
02:33:57,020 --> 02:33:59,020
A framed fragment of written verse.

3190
02:33:59,240 --> 02:34:08,160
It is in Latin and makes references mostly to diabolical entities and how man is dominated by them if he strays from the rights of protection.

3191
02:34:09,980 --> 02:34:10,900
I'm scared.

3192
02:34:15,400 --> 02:34:17,220
You old foxhound.

3193
02:34:17,720 --> 02:34:18,200
Oh!

3194
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:21,060
Oh my gosh.

3195
02:34:21,400 --> 02:34:21,760
Devil.

3196
02:34:22,100 --> 02:34:22,580
Devilish.

3197
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:23,480
Devilry.

3198
02:34:23,580 --> 02:34:24,060
Devilry.

3199
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:25,400
Devilry.

3200
02:34:25,400 --> 02:34:25,880
Devilry.

3201
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:26,340
Devilry.

3202
02:34:30,120 --> 02:34:30,600
Wait.

3203
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:34,920
Who is this?

3204
02:34:35,140 --> 02:34:35,500
Oh, wait.

3205
02:34:35,560 --> 02:34:36,680
That's Augustus.

3206
02:34:37,720 --> 02:34:38,680
We're missing...

3207
02:34:39,860 --> 02:34:41,020
Why isn't he here?

3208
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:42,500
Oh, he hasn't happened yet.

3209
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:47,120
Okay.

3210
02:34:47,180 --> 02:34:47,900
Thank you.

3211
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:48,500
Take the tome.

3212
02:34:48,500 --> 02:34:48,740
Yeah.

3213
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:49,080
Yeah.

3214
02:34:49,100 --> 02:34:49,420
Shut up.

3215
02:34:50,340 --> 02:34:50,520
Be quiet.

3216
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,180
Okay.

3217
02:34:59,480 --> 02:35:01,680
That was pretty devilish.

3218
02:35:01,820 --> 02:35:02,280
Wait.

3219
02:35:02,320 --> 02:35:03,080
I want to see the emerald.

3220
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:07,340
Flex the light inside it perfectly.

3221
02:35:10,400 --> 02:35:11,180
Oh my gosh.

3222
02:35:11,260 --> 02:35:13,060
Sorry if I start yawning a lot, you guys.

3223
02:35:15,960 --> 02:35:18,920
Probably what's going to keep me um...

3224
02:35:21,100 --> 02:35:21,640
uh...

3225
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:23,680
from doing such a long stream today.

3226
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:27,140
I was really planning on going super long today, but I'm so tired.

3227
02:35:27,240 --> 02:35:27,840
I'm so sorry.

3228
02:35:28,040 --> 02:35:29,280
But I still want to beat this chapter.

3229
02:35:29,940 --> 02:35:34,320
Paul cannot leave the cathedral until his name is cleared and the real murderer has been uncovered.

3230
02:35:34,680 --> 02:35:37,040
To run away now would be an admission of his guilt.

3231
02:35:38,660 --> 02:35:39,540
I mean...

3232
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:42,780
So I'm just going to go to the bell tower?

3233
02:35:44,700 --> 02:35:45,260
Let's go.

3234
02:35:46,520 --> 02:35:48,220
I have nothing with me though.

3235
02:35:48,380 --> 02:35:49,320
I'm so scared.

3236
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:54,660
If I have the Tome of Eternal Darkness, that means the demons can get me.

3237
02:35:59,980 --> 02:36:01,880
I have nothing to protect myself.

3238
02:36:09,100 --> 02:36:10,560
This chapter is pretty long.

3239
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:10,920
That's okay.

3240
02:36:19,440 --> 02:36:21,480
I have nothing to protect myself.

3241
02:36:24,380 --> 02:36:26,720
How am I supposed to...

3242
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:27,680
Wow.

3243
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:29,920
Wow.

3244
02:36:30,720 --> 02:36:33,230
Don't do it!

3245
02:36:40,490 --> 02:36:41,130
Dodge.

3246
02:36:41,650 --> 02:36:42,690
Yeah, pretty much.

3247
02:36:43,010 --> 02:36:44,870
I'm just going to have to run around him.

3248
02:36:45,590 --> 02:36:45,670
Ah!

3249
02:36:52,880 --> 02:36:53,840
Yeah, yeah.

3250
02:36:54,960 --> 02:36:56,100
Don't get stuck.

3251
02:36:56,440 --> 02:36:56,740
Okay.

3252
02:37:03,220 --> 02:37:04,500
Okay, um...

3253
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:12,340
I guess we're going up.

3254
02:37:16,660 --> 02:37:19,240
Oh, Maximilian Roivis' statue is from...

3255
02:37:19,240 --> 02:37:20,680
is there?

3256
02:37:20,820 --> 02:37:21,680
And he's from 1760.

3257
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:22,680
Yeah, that's right!

3258
02:37:23,540 --> 02:37:26,480
It's not a matter of when in history that causes the statue.

3259
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:27,000
Oh.

3260
02:37:30,300 --> 02:37:30,840
Interesting.

3261
02:37:31,220 --> 02:37:32,060
Is it a...

3262
02:37:32,920 --> 02:37:34,620
Is it death?

3263
02:37:35,100 --> 02:37:36,280
Well, I mean...

3264
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:41,840
Because if the grandpa was alive...

3265
02:37:42,900 --> 02:37:43,340
Then...

3266
02:37:44,620 --> 02:37:45,060
Um...

3267
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:47,480
Then...

3268
02:37:50,040 --> 02:37:50,480
Well...

3269
02:37:50,480 --> 02:37:51,840
I guess he didn't use the toe.

3270
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:52,900
Well, I don't know.

3271
02:37:52,980 --> 02:37:53,460
But like...

3272
02:37:53,460 --> 02:37:54,200
You know what I mean.

3273
02:37:54,280 --> 02:37:55,340
The grandpa was alive.

3274
02:37:55,620 --> 02:37:56,780
And we knew our grandpa.

3275
02:37:57,140 --> 02:37:59,200
And that guy gave us the heart.

3276
02:37:59,540 --> 02:38:01,600
So Lindsey must have...

3277
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:03,000
Could still be alive.

3278
02:38:04,740 --> 02:38:05,180
Maybe.

3279
02:38:05,440 --> 02:38:05,860
I don't know.

3280
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:09,080
Okay.

3281
02:38:09,080 --> 02:38:11,080
We're just gonna keep going up.

3282
02:38:12,060 --> 02:38:12,780
Let's go.

3283
02:38:12,980 --> 02:38:13,860
Let's climb!

3284
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:16,860
Let's climb, brother!

3285
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:20,760
This is the...

3286
02:38:20,760 --> 02:38:21,760
bell tower, right?

3287
02:38:23,320 --> 02:38:23,960
Um...

3288
02:38:23,960 --> 02:38:24,960
Hello?

3289
02:38:25,800 --> 02:38:26,980
What is this room?

3290
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:31,020
Never mind.

3291
02:38:31,340 --> 02:38:32,040
This is...

3292
02:38:32,760 --> 02:38:33,400
What?

3293
02:38:35,080 --> 02:38:35,720
Huh?

3294
02:38:43,060 --> 02:38:43,700
Okay.

3295
02:38:45,900 --> 02:38:46,500
See ya!

3296
02:38:48,340 --> 02:38:48,760
No.

3297
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:50,160
Grandpa is not a statue.

3298
02:38:51,900 --> 02:38:52,320
Um...

3299
02:38:52,320 --> 02:38:52,920
I don't know.

3300
02:38:54,280 --> 02:38:55,340
Did I go through here?

3301
02:38:55,580 --> 02:38:56,700
Or this is where I came from.

3302
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:00,140
Ring the bell!

3303
02:39:00,260 --> 02:39:00,300
Ring the bell!

3304
02:39:00,300 --> 02:39:01,340
It didn't give me an option to.

3305
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:04,180
Okay.

3306
02:39:04,180 --> 02:39:04,640
We're dancing.

3307
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:07,360
I'm just gonna walk away.

3308
02:39:07,660 --> 02:39:08,060
I'm just gonna walk away.

3309
02:39:08,980 --> 02:39:09,400
Alright.

3310
02:39:09,520 --> 02:39:10,000
See ya!

3311
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:12,980
See ya, dummy!

3312
02:39:13,180 --> 02:39:13,320
See ya, dummy!

3313
02:39:23,610 --> 02:39:24,170
We...

3314
02:39:24,170 --> 02:39:24,810
We...

3315
02:39:24,810 --> 02:39:27,010
We can go into the main area.

3316
02:39:27,830 --> 02:39:28,330
I suppose.

3317
02:39:31,990 --> 02:39:32,550
Okay.

3318
02:39:36,120 --> 02:39:38,220
I came from that door over there.

3319
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:40,240
I came from that door over there.

3320
02:39:40,240 --> 02:39:40,300
I came from that door over there.

3321
02:39:42,980 --> 02:39:46,380
I feel like this guy is just walking around a little too freely.

3322
02:39:46,620 --> 02:39:47,480
I feel like this guy is just walking around a little too freely.

3323
02:39:47,480 --> 02:39:52,780
For someone who's afraid of like, you know, For someone who's afraid of like, you know, being marked as the culprit.

3324
02:39:52,780 --> 02:39:54,520
I feel like this guy is...

3325
02:39:55,580 --> 02:39:57,060
Just kind of like...

3326
02:39:57,060 --> 02:39:58,820
A little too nonchalant...

3327
02:39:58,820 --> 02:40:00,080
About just kind of...

3328
02:40:00,650 --> 02:40:01,500
Chillin' around...

3329
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:02,640
This church.

3330
02:40:05,220 --> 02:40:06,620
Oh, there's a door over here.

3331
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:09,900
What's this?

3332
02:40:10,940 --> 02:40:11,640
Oh!

3333
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:17,520
Oh, you got a torch!

3334
02:40:20,800 --> 02:40:22,140
All is well.

3335
02:40:23,400 --> 02:40:24,920
Ha ha ha ha!

3336
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:33,000
Oh.

3337
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:36,160
A heavy wooden chest sits up against the room's wall.

3338
02:40:36,300 --> 02:40:37,560
It appears to be old and worn.

3339
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:38,320
Yeah.

3340
02:40:40,060 --> 02:40:41,180
A crossbow?

3341
02:40:45,340 --> 02:40:45,900
Okay.

3342
02:40:47,720 --> 02:40:48,960
Okay, okay, okay!

3343
02:40:53,320 --> 02:40:56,720
The rack carries robes and cloaks for ceremonial use.

3344
02:40:58,140 --> 02:40:58,960
As per...

3345
02:40:58,980 --> 02:41:01,280
Paul draws the robes back, something tumbles from inside.

3346
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:02,940
A podium key!

3347
02:41:05,060 --> 02:41:06,380
Dang, this room is...

3348
02:41:06,980 --> 02:41:07,300
Stacked.

3349
02:41:07,420 --> 02:41:07,540
Oh!

3350
02:41:08,020 --> 02:41:09,240
Mori Calliope.

3351
02:41:10,700 --> 02:41:14,200
A woodcut depicting the effects of a plague.

3352
02:41:14,420 --> 02:41:19,160
The spirit of death incarnate casts final judgment over a wealth of victims.

3353
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:28,060
The people in the background kind of look like how, you know, in renaissance paintings they draw cats.

3354
02:41:28,980 --> 02:41:29,740
That's what they remind me of.

3355
02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:31,920
Check the other one.

3356
02:41:32,080 --> 02:41:32,560
What other one?

3357
02:41:32,680 --> 02:41:33,040
Oh, this one?

3358
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:36,160
Oh!

3359
02:41:36,400 --> 02:41:37,940
Oh, what's going on here?

3360
02:41:38,760 --> 02:41:41,760
A woodcut shows an act of blasphemy!

3361
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:51,960
A host of demons prey upon humans like they were playthings, disemboweled by mocking demons, eaten or tortured by other carnal deviant acts.

3362
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:09,480
I can't tell what's going on though.

3363
02:42:12,360 --> 02:42:15,380
Why would you hang that up in the church?

3364
02:42:16,600 --> 02:42:17,400
Why would you hang that up in the church?

3365
02:42:21,560 --> 02:42:22,360
Why?

3366
02:42:23,240 --> 02:42:26,700
Why is that hung up here?

3367
02:42:31,900 --> 02:42:32,800
We can play!

3368
02:42:32,920 --> 02:42:34,820
What are you looking at?

3369
02:42:37,880 --> 02:42:40,880
Characters in old games like stare at...

3370
02:42:42,900 --> 02:42:43,840
at things.

3371
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:45,380
You know, it freaks me out.

3372
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:50,740
Playing the organ is a daunting challenge for someone like Paul who has no musical talent.

3373
02:42:51,020 --> 02:42:54,080
Paul could probably play the organ if there was some music to play.

3374
02:42:55,540 --> 02:42:57,600
Paul, don't sell yourself short!

3375
02:42:58,440 --> 02:42:59,300
What do you mean?

3376
02:42:59,900 --> 02:43:03,420
Sneaking around a giant building, avoiding the guards, discovering a conspiracy.

3377
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:08,440
But this time it's Cole Campbell.

3378
02:43:09,420 --> 02:43:10,340
What a twist!

3379
02:43:11,100 --> 02:43:14,500
The altar is bereft of holy adornment.

3380
02:43:14,620 --> 02:43:17,940
No crucifix, no bible, no sacrament of any kind.

3381
02:43:18,180 --> 02:43:19,780
Paul is disturbed by this sight.

3382
02:43:19,980 --> 02:43:21,800
What faith does the order practice?

3383
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:24,800
What is this?

3384
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:26,200
Oh, is this a basement?

3385
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:28,300
Oh!

3386
02:43:29,640 --> 02:43:32,560
He said we should go to the Bell Tower?

3387
02:43:36,400 --> 02:43:38,560
I think that implies going up.

3388
02:43:38,760 --> 02:43:39,720
Oh, what's this over here?

3389
02:43:40,580 --> 02:43:42,340
Paul is voiced by Paul Eide...

3390
02:43:42,340 --> 02:43:43,520
What?!

3391
02:43:43,520 --> 02:43:44,340
No way!

3392
02:43:45,060 --> 02:43:46,020
No he's not!

3393
02:43:46,680 --> 02:43:48,000
I got some bolts!

3394
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:56,780
The cathedral's tabernacle is fashioned from age.

3395
02:43:57,540 --> 02:43:58,640
Varnished mahogany.

3396
02:43:58,960 --> 02:44:03,160
Its doors are closed and there doesn't appear to be any way of opening them in many.

3397
02:44:05,700 --> 02:44:06,300
Colonel!

3398
02:44:06,660 --> 02:44:08,140
I couldn't hear it at all.

3399
02:44:09,800 --> 02:44:11,640
Alright Paul, I'm gonna need you to speak.

3400
02:44:14,520 --> 02:44:17,340
We're gonna get his sanity real low so he can say something.

3401
02:44:17,540 --> 02:44:20,680
Oh, Paul notes that the door to the old tower is locked.

3402
02:44:20,820 --> 02:44:22,300
Perhaps the custodian might have the key.

3403
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,100
So this is the podium key.

3404
02:44:26,380 --> 02:44:29,440
What does a podium key go to?

3405
02:44:31,140 --> 02:44:35,100
For the podium and the cathedral apes?

3406
02:44:36,360 --> 02:44:36,820
Apes?

3407
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:38,840
A podium?

3408
02:44:39,280 --> 02:44:43,100
Yeah, but I'm just checking where it is.

3409
02:44:50,780 --> 02:44:52,880
The custodian is Cam Clark!

3410
02:44:54,340 --> 02:45:03,900
I mean, I know that this is Silicon Knights, but we've had other Metal Gear people in the game earlier.

3411
02:45:07,720 --> 02:45:09,240
Maybe I should go downstairs.

3412
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:14,300
Okay, let's go downstairs.

3413
02:45:19,980 --> 02:45:20,640
Okay,

3414
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:23,800
let's go downstairs.

3415
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:24,260
Spooky.

3416
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:26,580
Freaky.

3417
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:28,860
What's down here?

3418
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:32,840
Oh, crossbow.

3419
02:45:35,720 --> 02:45:37,680
The sound is so funny.

3420
02:45:37,880 --> 02:45:41,100
The personal effects of a priest are scattered across the shelves.

3421
02:45:41,300 --> 02:45:45,740
Rosary beads and crucifix and a variety of other small holy items.

3422
02:45:45,960 --> 02:45:48,620
Paul believes they must have been Brother Andrews.

3423
02:45:49,260 --> 02:45:51,020
Okay, what makes you think that?

3424
02:45:52,460 --> 02:45:54,720
A desk bears a leather-bound book.

3425
02:45:57,120 --> 02:46:00,000
Book of Reliquaries.

3426
02:46:01,720 --> 02:46:05,900
It's weird to hear Cam Clark say brethren.

3427
02:46:06,360 --> 02:46:08,160
Different accent than usual, right?

3428
02:46:10,440 --> 02:46:11,240
What's this?

3429
02:46:12,820 --> 02:46:13,460
Oh.

3430
02:46:14,220 --> 02:46:15,240
No comment.

3431
02:46:18,420 --> 02:46:19,060
Okay.

3432
02:46:22,380 --> 02:46:23,020
Nice.

3433
02:46:23,740 --> 02:46:25,940
Can this book also be picked up?

3434
02:46:26,920 --> 02:46:27,560
No.

3435
02:46:27,560 --> 02:46:27,940
Okay.

3436
02:46:31,880 --> 02:46:32,740
Clam Clark.

3437
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:34,640
Clam Clark.

3438
02:46:37,670 --> 02:46:39,150
I don't even like clams.

3439
02:46:39,430 --> 02:46:39,810
Ooh.

3440
02:46:42,570 --> 02:46:43,510
What's this down here?

3441
02:46:45,370 --> 02:46:46,130
What is this?

3442
02:46:46,350 --> 02:46:46,570
Oh.

3443
02:46:46,810 --> 02:46:51,250
The bellows mechanism supplies the organ upstairs with air.

3444
02:46:51,370 --> 02:46:55,750
It requires an expert hand and attention to keep it in working order.

3445
02:46:56,350 --> 02:46:56,830
What?

3446
02:46:57,230 --> 02:46:59,070
I wonder if this is kind of accurate.

3447
02:46:59,410 --> 02:47:00,030
What's this?

3448
02:47:02,170 --> 02:47:07,330
Near the organ, a steel base is mounted on the back wall by means of a display armature.

3449
02:47:09,350 --> 02:47:10,130
Holy cow!

3450
02:47:10,190 --> 02:47:11,050
We got a mace!

3451
02:47:12,550 --> 02:47:16,050
I mean, I'm still gonna just kind of hold on to the...

3452
02:47:18,430 --> 02:47:21,430
I'm still gonna hold on to our torch is number one, I'm just gonna say.

3453
02:47:21,890 --> 02:47:22,250
But...

3454
02:47:31,770 --> 02:47:32,130
Oh...

3455
02:47:32,130 --> 02:47:33,110
No, it's a trapper!

3456
02:47:37,310 --> 02:47:37,670
Um...

3457
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:39,390
How do I kill these things again?

3458
02:47:43,830 --> 02:47:45,110
Sounds like there's more than one.

3459
02:47:45,350 --> 02:47:46,130
I can't tell though.

3460
02:48:02,700 --> 02:48:03,520
Did I kill it?

3461
02:48:03,560 --> 02:48:03,740
Wow!

3462
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:04,240
One shot!

3463
02:48:18,940 --> 02:48:19,800
Okay, reload.

3464
02:48:20,660 --> 02:48:22,360
I have to remember to do that.

3465
02:48:26,890 --> 02:48:27,470
Okay.

3466
02:48:29,050 --> 02:48:30,490
I think we got him.

3467
02:48:34,670 --> 02:48:35,370
That's it?

3468
02:48:37,010 --> 02:48:37,590
Ooh!

3469
02:48:37,830 --> 02:48:38,870
These camera angles!

3470
02:48:40,110 --> 02:48:41,270
What am I examining?

3471
02:48:41,990 --> 02:48:43,890
A wine cask used for...

3472
02:48:43,890 --> 02:48:44,070
Why?

3473
02:48:44,130 --> 02:48:44,730
Who knocked?

3474
02:48:44,730 --> 02:48:45,490
We'll just...

3475
02:48:45,490 --> 02:48:47,490
Used for maturing wine.

3476
02:48:47,710 --> 02:48:54,910
The wine inside this one must be very strong for it seeps through the cask, filling the air with a heady aroma.

3477
02:48:57,710 --> 02:48:59,190
How about this one?

3478
02:49:00,030 --> 02:49:00,890
Boom, boom, boom.

3479
02:49:03,630 --> 02:49:05,290
I'm just knocking on the barrels.

3480
02:49:10,120 --> 02:49:10,680
Okay.

3481
02:49:12,160 --> 02:49:14,020
Is there something on one of the...

3482
02:49:14,020 --> 02:49:16,200
Is there something I must find?

3483
02:49:16,720 --> 02:49:18,840
In one of these heady aromas?

3484
02:49:24,970 --> 02:49:25,550
Oh!

3485
02:49:25,710 --> 02:49:25,990
Oh!

3486
02:49:27,210 --> 02:49:30,090
Knocking on this cask results in a hollow thud.

3487
02:49:30,150 --> 02:49:31,030
It is empty!

3488
02:49:31,190 --> 02:49:35,190
But why, when all the others are full of maturing wine?

3489
02:49:35,830 --> 02:49:36,410
Yes.

3490
02:49:37,010 --> 02:49:37,590
Turned!

3491
02:49:37,630 --> 02:49:38,210
Turn!

3492
02:49:50,960 --> 02:49:53,640
Hold on before I get too far.

3493
02:49:56,040 --> 02:49:56,520
Um...

3494
02:49:56,520 --> 02:49:58,340
I don't think we've saved at all.

3495
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:00,900
There we go.

3496
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:01,780
Paul Luther!

3497
02:50:09,800 --> 02:50:10,760
I don't...

3498
02:50:10,760 --> 02:50:11,140
Oh!

3499
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:14,160
Paul...

3500
02:50:14,160 --> 02:50:15,060
I don't think we're ready...

3501
02:50:15,060 --> 02:50:15,700
I don't think we're...

3502
02:50:15,700 --> 02:50:16,940
You know Paul.

3503
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:21,360
Let's go back to the bell tower.

3504
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:23,080
See if I missed anything there.

3505
02:50:23,640 --> 02:50:24,420
Once more.

3506
02:50:25,900 --> 02:50:26,900
You know...

3507
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:29,200
Could be something.

3508
02:50:30,460 --> 02:50:31,740
Blue guy...

3509
02:50:31,740 --> 02:50:34,040
Okay, so I have to enchant...

3510
02:50:35,300 --> 02:50:37,220
Yeah, like where's the podium exactly?

3511
02:50:38,140 --> 02:50:39,640
There's stuff that we...

3512
02:50:41,160 --> 02:50:42,440
are looking for.

3513
02:50:42,980 --> 02:50:43,860
Real quick.

3514
02:50:54,780 --> 02:50:56,540
My sanity isn't that low.

3515
02:50:59,020 --> 02:51:00,380
What the hell was that?

3516
02:51:02,680 --> 02:51:03,840
My sanity isn't that low.

3517
02:51:08,420 --> 02:51:09,260
What did that...

3518
02:51:09,260 --> 02:51:09,920
What did that mean?

3519
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:12,460
I'm confused.

3520
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:14,300
What was that trying to...

3521
02:51:15,580 --> 02:51:16,060
Ambiance?

3522
02:51:16,140 --> 02:51:17,200
I don't think so.

3523
02:51:17,280 --> 02:51:19,440
Because we haven't heard that at all before even once.

3524
02:51:27,090 --> 02:51:27,570
What?

3525
02:51:32,130 --> 02:51:34,610
Maybe it's telling me to go to the clock tower.

3526
02:51:41,150 --> 02:51:43,170
Maybe it's telling me to go to the clock tower.

3527
02:51:48,450 --> 02:51:48,930
Hey!

3528
02:51:52,670 --> 02:51:53,150
Hey!

3529
02:51:53,950 --> 02:51:54,270
Hey!

3530
02:51:57,850 --> 02:51:58,970
What are you looking at?

3531
02:51:59,550 --> 02:52:00,250
All these?

3532
02:52:00,730 --> 02:52:00,870
All these?

3533
02:52:03,350 --> 02:52:04,770
Just waiting for it to die?

3534
02:52:11,270 --> 02:52:12,270
I hear you!

3535
02:52:17,530 --> 02:52:18,010
What?

3536
02:52:18,650 --> 02:52:20,010
What are you...

3537
02:52:22,050 --> 02:52:24,270
It actually kind of makes me like a little...

3538
02:52:25,470 --> 02:52:26,470
Little like...

3539
02:52:26,470 --> 02:52:27,350
You know that...

3540
02:52:27,350 --> 02:52:29,570
Pit you get in your stomach when you...

3541
02:52:29,570 --> 02:52:30,950
Are going down on a ride?

3542
02:52:31,760 --> 02:52:32,770
Like a roller coaster?

3543
02:52:42,680 --> 02:52:44,520
My sanity isn't that low.

3544
02:52:48,300 --> 02:52:50,320
I think Paul is very susceptible.

3545
02:52:52,640 --> 02:52:53,180
Perhaps.

3546
02:52:58,360 --> 02:52:58,800
Okay.

3547
02:52:58,960 --> 02:52:59,140
Oh!

3548
02:52:59,220 --> 02:52:59,560
Wait!

3549
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:02,600
Paul is nervous about ringing the bell.

3550
02:53:02,660 --> 02:53:03,660
Fearing his own capture.

3551
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:07,200
It is the custodian's...

3552
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:09,200
Task to ring the bell at appropriate times.

3553
02:53:09,500 --> 02:53:10,500
Perhaps he will...

3554
02:53:10,500 --> 02:53:11,720
Be by later to ring it.

3555
02:53:12,060 --> 02:53:14,120
Should Paul ring the bell anyway?

3556
02:53:19,340 --> 02:53:19,780
Yes?

3557
02:53:27,580 --> 02:53:29,060
I saved not too long ago.

3558
02:53:29,140 --> 02:53:29,460
It's okay.

3559
02:53:30,360 --> 02:53:31,540
Oh my god!

3560
02:53:43,700 --> 02:53:45,400
Ah, brother Luther.

3561
02:53:45,760 --> 02:53:47,400
Not a moment too soon.

3562
02:53:47,860 --> 02:53:49,640
As you have noticed...

3563
02:53:49,640 --> 02:53:50,440
This is Camp Clark?

3564
02:53:50,660 --> 02:53:52,260
Great things inhabit this place.

3565
02:53:52,800 --> 02:53:54,120
Shambling corpses.

3566
02:53:54,420 --> 02:53:54,780
Yeah.

3567
02:53:54,940 --> 02:53:58,020
There is darkness at work here.

3568
02:53:58,240 --> 02:54:00,680
In the midst of the Inquisition.

3569
02:54:00,880 --> 02:54:01,640
Okay, I hear it.

3570
02:54:01,660 --> 02:54:03,480
I suspect it is worse than that.

3571
02:54:03,520 --> 02:54:04,860
I hear Colonel.

3572
02:54:05,960 --> 02:54:08,280
Brother Andrew knew this also.

3573
02:54:08,640 --> 02:54:10,180
And paid the price.

3574
02:54:10,280 --> 02:54:12,820
Why are you telling me this?

3575
02:54:13,140 --> 02:54:16,380
Perhaps you can think of where Andrew started.

3576
02:54:16,860 --> 02:54:18,160
Take this key.

3577
02:54:18,380 --> 02:54:20,460
It unlocks the old tower.

3578
02:54:20,880 --> 02:54:24,260
It has been sealed off since the Inquisition arrived.

3579
02:54:24,720 --> 02:54:28,280
I intend to uncover the truth behind this.

3580
02:54:28,580 --> 02:54:34,140
If you manage to uncover the source of darkness, return here.

3581
02:54:34,360 --> 02:54:37,220
And I will do everything I can to help.

3582
02:54:37,860 --> 02:54:39,720
Till then, brother.

3583
02:54:39,780 --> 02:54:40,260
I will be waiting for you.

3584
02:54:40,280 --> 02:54:40,760
Brother?

3585
02:54:41,140 --> 02:54:42,500
May your faith protect you.

3586
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:44,420
And my torch.

3587
02:54:46,040 --> 02:54:47,460
Old tower key.

3588
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:48,600
Yes.

3589
02:54:50,860 --> 02:54:51,460
Okay.

3590
02:54:52,800 --> 02:55:00,160
The custodian shakes his head and informs Paul that he doesn't have enough evidence to make an accusation against Augustine.

3591
02:55:01,060 --> 02:55:01,660
Augustine.

3592
02:55:01,880 --> 02:55:04,220
There must be something else to find.

3593
02:55:04,480 --> 02:55:04,680
Okay.

3594
02:55:06,340 --> 02:55:06,940
Okay.

3595
02:55:06,960 --> 02:55:07,320
See you.

3596
02:55:10,280 --> 02:55:10,980
Cool.

3597
02:55:18,750 --> 02:55:20,030
Okay.

3598
02:55:23,410 --> 02:55:25,430
The old tower.

3599
02:55:26,630 --> 02:55:27,690
Clock tower.

3600
02:55:29,670 --> 02:55:32,230
All these...

3601
02:55:32,570 --> 02:55:34,430
Spooky games having...

3602
02:55:35,110 --> 02:55:36,710
Having...

3603
02:55:36,710 --> 02:55:38,430
Towers in them.

3604
02:55:40,690 --> 02:55:41,970
Okay.

3605
02:55:43,290 --> 02:55:45,590
I just saved recently but...

3606
02:55:46,170 --> 02:55:46,950
Save again.

3607
02:55:47,570 --> 02:55:50,130
So that we can...

3608
02:55:50,130 --> 02:55:50,650
Okay.

3609
02:55:52,150 --> 02:55:54,230
Isn't Paul's voice the same as Campbell's?

3610
02:55:54,830 --> 02:55:55,690
Like Colonel?

3611
02:55:56,890 --> 02:55:57,450
Like...

3612
02:55:57,450 --> 02:55:58,650
Metal Gear Solid Colonel?

3613
02:55:58,790 --> 02:55:58,930
Yeah.

3614
02:55:59,750 --> 02:56:00,630
Paul Eiding?

3615
02:56:01,610 --> 02:56:03,930
Paul Eiding is the voice actor's name.

3616
02:56:03,990 --> 02:56:05,830
But the character in this game is also named Paul.

3617
02:56:09,650 --> 02:56:11,550
But where does this key...

3618
02:56:11,970 --> 02:56:12,530
Wait.

3619
02:56:12,810 --> 02:56:13,870
It says...

3620
02:56:14,810 --> 02:56:16,810
In the cathedral...

3621
02:56:16,810 --> 02:56:17,690
What is that?

3622
02:56:17,790 --> 02:56:18,930
I don't even know what that room is.

3623
02:56:20,530 --> 02:56:21,610
And it doesn't...

3624
02:56:21,610 --> 02:56:24,090
It doesn't give a name or anything.

3625
02:56:26,350 --> 02:56:27,190
In here?

3626
02:56:32,600 --> 02:56:33,800
It's not to this, right?

3627
02:56:33,980 --> 02:56:34,900
Oh wait.

3628
02:56:35,620 --> 02:56:36,180
Oh!

3629
02:56:36,200 --> 02:56:41,060
A single podium and lectern provides a platform for a priest giving a sermon to his congregation.

3630
02:56:41,440 --> 02:56:42,080
There's a drawer!

3631
02:56:43,340 --> 02:56:43,680
Open.

3632
02:56:45,260 --> 02:56:45,480
Wow!

3633
02:56:47,280 --> 02:56:49,040
I didn't realize that this was a podium.

3634
02:56:55,660 --> 02:56:58,140
A diary page lies inside the open drawer.

3635
02:56:58,320 --> 02:56:58,640
Yes!

3636
02:57:00,520 --> 02:57:01,000
Okay.

3637
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:03,300
This is the evidence we're supposed to find though, right?

3638
02:57:03,560 --> 02:57:04,860
We got a diary page!

3639
02:57:05,140 --> 02:57:06,860
A diary of Brother Andrew.

3640
02:57:07,040 --> 02:57:07,640
Page 1.

3641
02:57:08,140 --> 02:57:10,320
I have finally arrived at...

3642
02:57:13,400 --> 02:57:14,040
Amiens.

3643
02:57:15,140 --> 02:57:19,500
And my pilgrimage to see the hand of Jude draws to a close.

3644
02:57:19,820 --> 02:57:23,280
I cannot wait to lay eyes upon the sacred relic.

3645
02:57:23,380 --> 02:57:27,440
My journey here has been arduous.

3646
02:57:27,580 --> 02:57:31,700
And it shall be good to relax for a while in this peaceful village.

3647
02:57:33,160 --> 02:57:33,800
Amiens...

3648
02:57:34,620 --> 02:57:35,260
Aliens.

3649
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:37,340
Aliens is full of good people.

3650
02:57:37,340 --> 02:57:41,280
Strong in their faith and their rule in our world.

3651
02:57:41,520 --> 02:57:46,720
If the blight of witchcraft is present in this world, then I doubt it is in aliens.

3652
02:57:49,840 --> 02:57:50,560
Okay.

3653
02:57:51,220 --> 02:57:53,840
That is not the tea we need.

3654
02:57:54,420 --> 02:58:03,000
We need the evidence of them committing terrible crimes.

3655
02:58:03,860 --> 02:58:04,880
Devilish crimes.

3656
02:58:04,880 --> 02:58:05,240
Devilish crimes.

3657
02:58:05,940 --> 02:58:06,520
Devilish crimes.

3658
02:58:07,100 --> 02:58:08,260
Devilish crimes.

3659
02:58:10,380 --> 02:58:11,060
Let's go!

3660
02:58:16,200 --> 02:58:18,540
Oh no, not these things again!

3661
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:20,780
Oh no, no, no.

3662
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:21,840
Oh, uh...

3663
02:58:39,170 --> 02:58:39,750
Um...

3664
02:58:42,710 --> 02:58:43,290
Ah!

3665
02:58:46,200 --> 02:58:47,120
Oh shoot!

3666
02:58:49,270 --> 02:58:50,680
Oh gosh, I forgot this thing!

3667
02:58:50,820 --> 02:58:51,700
How do I...

3668
02:58:53,270 --> 02:58:53,560
Ah!

3669
02:59:10,330 --> 02:59:11,570
I think we got it.

3670
02:59:11,730 --> 02:59:12,410
Finish him!

3671
02:59:13,870 --> 02:59:14,730
Holy cow.

3672
02:59:15,010 --> 02:59:15,950
Oh my god, my sanity.

3673
02:59:16,470 --> 02:59:18,590
It ate all my sanity in one go.

3674
02:59:19,790 --> 02:59:21,190
Our health is okay.

3675
02:59:21,410 --> 02:59:22,110
Not bad.

3676
02:59:22,310 --> 02:59:23,010
Could be worse.

3677
02:59:27,850 --> 02:59:28,590
We're fine.

3678
02:59:28,850 --> 02:59:29,650
Just a little...

3679
02:59:29,650 --> 02:59:30,770
A little funky.

3680
02:59:30,990 --> 02:59:31,950
Feeling okay, Paul?

3681
02:59:33,430 --> 02:59:34,650
It's probably fine.

3682
02:59:34,910 --> 02:59:36,110
I hate those...

3683
02:59:42,610 --> 02:59:44,250
I forgot all about...

3684
02:59:44,250 --> 02:59:46,350
I forgot all about...

3685
02:59:46,350 --> 02:59:46,350
Wait!

3686
02:59:46,750 --> 02:59:47,870
It's this place!

3687
02:59:48,330 --> 02:59:49,810
Oh my god.

3688
02:59:50,110 --> 02:59:53,390
The scroll of aged paper sits on the dusty altar top.

3689
02:59:53,610 --> 02:59:54,890
Seems to have been discarded.

3690
02:59:56,390 --> 02:59:57,810
We've been here before!

3691
02:59:58,350 --> 02:59:59,030
Shields?

3692
03:00:00,370 --> 03:00:01,210
What's that?

3693
03:00:02,210 --> 03:00:02,890
Oh!

3694
03:00:02,950 --> 03:00:03,550
Oh!

3695
03:00:03,550 --> 03:00:04,150
Oh!

3696
03:00:04,410 --> 03:00:04,950
Ah!

3697
03:00:08,670 --> 03:00:09,650
Thank you.

3698
03:00:11,170 --> 03:00:11,710
Yeah,

3699
03:00:15,730 --> 03:00:16,970
I remember this guy...

3700
03:00:16,970 --> 03:00:19,490
was in there and...

3701
03:00:21,450 --> 03:00:23,150
There was like a body in there...

3702
03:00:23,150 --> 03:00:25,190
and we tried to go in here to warn...

3703
03:00:25,190 --> 03:00:27,510
the guy...

3704
03:00:27,510 --> 03:00:28,370
Oh my god.

3705
03:00:28,430 --> 03:00:28,690
Ah!

3706
03:00:29,370 --> 03:00:30,150
Turn around!

3707
03:00:30,370 --> 03:00:31,910
I thought

3708
03:00:38,660 --> 03:00:39,220
that was real!

3709
03:00:39,220 --> 03:00:41,240
I thought that was real for real!

3710
03:00:42,100 --> 03:00:43,420
Oh my gosh.

3711
03:00:43,480 --> 03:00:44,460
The game got me good.

3712
03:00:47,560 --> 03:00:49,180
The game got me good.

3713
03:00:49,300 --> 03:00:49,620
I was like...

3714
03:00:49,620 --> 03:00:51,360
They literally one-hit me.

3715
03:00:53,420 --> 03:00:53,900
Oh.

3716
03:00:55,360 --> 03:00:55,840
Ah!

3717
03:00:56,920 --> 03:00:57,400
Happening!

3718
03:01:01,880 --> 03:01:02,540
No, no!

3719
03:01:02,560 --> 03:01:03,360
I'm on your side!

3720
03:01:03,480 --> 03:01:04,020
I'm on your side!

3721
03:01:06,420 --> 03:01:07,300
He's yellow.

3722
03:01:08,080 --> 03:01:08,560
Uh...

3723
03:01:11,600 --> 03:01:12,480
Um...

3724
03:01:14,440 --> 03:01:15,320
Um...

3725
03:01:17,260 --> 03:01:18,140
Um...

3726
03:01:18,140 --> 03:01:19,520
I'm on your side!

3727
03:01:21,120 --> 03:01:22,000
Ah!

3728
03:01:22,880 --> 03:01:23,320
Ah!

3729
03:01:23,660 --> 03:01:26,220
I guess I'll just mace him to death.

3730
03:01:26,380 --> 03:01:27,440
Well, I mean...

3731
03:01:27,440 --> 03:01:30,820
To whatever after that.

3732
03:01:34,880 --> 03:01:35,760
Oh!

3733
03:01:40,820 --> 03:01:41,260
Oh!

3734
03:02:06,060 --> 03:02:07,280
Are you okay?

3735
03:02:09,880 --> 03:02:10,460
Oh, shoot.

3736
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:12,400
Uh...

3737
03:02:14,900 --> 03:02:16,140
I don't think I can kill him.

3738
03:02:17,700 --> 03:02:18,640
I think I should leave.

3739
03:02:20,780 --> 03:02:22,360
I don't think I can kill him.

3740
03:02:22,640 --> 03:02:23,040
Yet.

3741
03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:23,600
Maybe.

3742
03:02:24,740 --> 03:02:26,120
Maybe I can't kill him...

3743
03:02:26,120 --> 03:02:27,400
I can right now?

3744
03:02:28,700 --> 03:02:29,220
I can?

3745
03:02:29,400 --> 03:02:29,920
Oh god.

3746
03:02:54,520 --> 03:02:55,440
Oh, that other guy.

3747
03:02:55,500 --> 03:02:56,280
We didn't care about him.

3748
03:02:56,360 --> 03:02:57,160
We're not gonna pray for him.

3749
03:02:57,280 --> 03:02:57,960
But this guy will...

3750
03:02:59,100 --> 03:02:59,660
Oh...

3751
03:03:02,860 --> 03:03:03,900
Oh my gosh.

3752
03:03:04,040 --> 03:03:05,180
We were brothers.

3753
03:03:17,440 --> 03:03:18,920
Oh, there he goes!

3754
03:03:19,200 --> 03:03:20,120
Goodbye, Anthony.

3755
03:03:24,830 --> 03:03:26,090
What else is in here?

3756
03:03:26,470 --> 03:03:27,190
What's this?

3757
03:03:27,530 --> 03:03:29,730
He's just been chilling in here this whole time?

3758
03:03:33,350 --> 03:03:34,010
That's it?

3759
03:03:34,130 --> 03:03:34,650
There's nothing...

3760
03:03:34,650 --> 03:03:34,850
They...

3761
03:03:34,850 --> 03:03:37,530
They just locked you in here?

3762
03:03:38,510 --> 03:03:39,430
Poor guy!

3763
03:03:45,380 --> 03:03:46,840
Yep, that's all that's in there.

3764
03:03:46,920 --> 03:03:51,880
Okey dokey!

3765
03:03:53,880 --> 03:03:54,600
Um...

3766
03:03:54,600 --> 03:03:57,160
And we were... I remember...

3767
03:03:57,880 --> 03:03:58,600
Uh...

3768
03:03:58,600 --> 03:03:59,900
Upstairs...

3769
03:04:01,940 --> 03:04:03,300
There was...

3770
03:04:03,300 --> 03:04:04,880
That hidden room...

3771
03:04:04,880 --> 03:04:05,780
Remember in here?

3772
03:04:07,760 --> 03:04:08,700
Oh shit.

3773
03:04:09,320 --> 03:04:09,880
Ah!

3774
03:04:11,200 --> 03:04:11,760
Ugh!

3775
03:04:12,020 --> 03:04:15,460
I hate these... I hate these guys so much.

3776
03:04:15,500 --> 03:04:15,860
Sorry.

3777
03:04:45,030 --> 03:04:46,530
I'm trying to take out his other arm.

3778
03:04:47,930 --> 03:04:48,490
Yeah!

3779
03:04:48,830 --> 03:04:49,630
Finish him!

3780
03:04:49,730 --> 03:04:50,550
Finish him!

3781
03:04:50,690 --> 03:04:51,250
Yeah!

3782
03:04:54,170 --> 03:04:55,690
Yeah, they're so...

3783
03:04:56,270 --> 03:04:56,830
Annoying.

3784
03:04:57,310 --> 03:04:58,010
What's this?

3785
03:04:58,910 --> 03:04:59,710
She music!

3786
03:05:00,750 --> 03:05:01,310
Wonder...

3787
03:05:01,310 --> 03:05:02,830
One wonders what it sounds like.

3788
03:05:04,150 --> 03:05:05,890
A... B... Y...

3789
03:05:07,490 --> 03:05:09,310
X... B... Y...

3790
03:05:09,310 --> 03:05:11,150
A... B...

3791
03:05:11,150 --> 03:05:11,150
Y...

3792
03:05:11,450 --> 03:05:12,090
Oh no.

3793
03:05:12,290 --> 03:05:13,630
Am I actually gonna have to play?

3794
03:05:13,990 --> 03:05:16,070
Hey, where's the secret hole?

3795
03:05:16,870 --> 03:05:20,970
Laying on an abandoned easel is a sheet of tattered paper covered with Oh!

3796
03:05:25,110 --> 03:05:25,870
Yippee!

3797
03:05:27,490 --> 03:05:28,250
Oh!

3798
03:05:29,670 --> 03:05:30,610
You okay?

3799
03:05:30,610 --> 03:05:32,210
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.

3800
03:05:32,390 --> 03:05:33,650
I'm just gonna read the diary.

3801
03:05:37,770 --> 03:05:39,970
Diary of Brother Andrew, page 2.

3802
03:05:40,370 --> 03:05:42,410
I suppose it is an understandable...

3803
03:05:42,410 --> 03:05:47,350
Oh, it is understandable that they will not show me the hand of Jude on such little notice.

3804
03:05:47,570 --> 03:05:50,890
But I must confess that the preparations they make are most unusual.

3805
03:05:51,470 --> 03:05:58,470
No acts of consecration, no daily prayer or worship are demonstrated by this strange order.

3806
03:05:58,470 --> 03:06:04,790
One wonders if they are holy at all, let alone being under the auspices...

3807
03:06:06,570 --> 03:06:07,290
auspices...

3808
03:06:07,290 --> 03:06:07,730
auspices...

3809
03:06:08,450 --> 03:06:10,230
of the Grand Inquisition.

3810
03:06:10,650 --> 03:06:13,990
Perhaps it is my naivety...

3811
03:06:13,990 --> 03:06:16,430
my naivety...

3812
03:06:18,830 --> 03:06:20,710
of our faith.

3813
03:06:20,950 --> 03:06:26,390
There are many practices associated with it, and they differ greatly from region to region.

3814
03:06:27,210 --> 03:06:31,210
Perhaps one of our aliens is merely more eccentric than others.

3815
03:06:37,420 --> 03:06:42,300
A bewildering array of books and tombs, sorted neatly onto this set of shelves.

3816
03:06:42,560 --> 03:06:48,840
Mostly books of a religious nature, awaiting scholars such as Paul to peruse their contents.

3817
03:06:49,160 --> 03:06:49,940
Oh my gosh!

3818
03:06:50,120 --> 03:06:50,600
Paul!

3819
03:06:50,860 --> 03:06:51,520
You're a scholar!

3820
03:06:55,480 --> 03:06:55,840
Hmm...

3821
03:06:58,640 --> 03:06:59,460
Wait, what was that?

3822
03:07:02,620 --> 03:07:03,920
He's a scholar...

3823
03:07:07,200 --> 03:07:09,480
You guys, I was gonna say...

3824
03:07:10,720 --> 03:07:13,760
that I would play for a long time, but I'm fading so fast.

3825
03:07:14,020 --> 03:07:15,720
Oh my gosh, it's only 5pm for me.

3826
03:07:16,320 --> 03:07:17,960
I can't wait for me to go to bed.

3827
03:07:18,440 --> 03:07:19,480
Can't wait till bedtime.

3828
03:07:22,680 --> 03:07:23,880
I'm so sleepy.

3829
03:07:24,680 --> 03:07:26,780
Sorry if I'm a little less energetic.

3830
03:07:27,060 --> 03:07:27,620
I'm so sleepy.

3831
03:07:30,280 --> 03:07:30,840
Hmm...

3832
03:07:31,520 --> 03:07:32,760
Fighting the jet hag.

3833
03:07:34,100 --> 03:07:36,300
Was there any arrows in here?

3834
03:07:36,660 --> 03:07:37,220
Wait...

3835
03:07:41,660 --> 03:07:42,840
Was there anything...

3836
03:07:43,240 --> 03:07:44,400
Wait, what was even here?

3837
03:07:48,100 --> 03:07:49,840
There wasn't even anything...

3838
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:50,500
Did I miss something?

3839
03:07:51,260 --> 03:07:51,820
Hahaha...

3840
03:07:51,820 --> 03:07:53,040
Oh, I was tiny?

3841
03:07:56,880 --> 03:07:58,000
It's average...

3842
03:07:58,000 --> 03:07:59,220
Average Sunday.

3843
03:08:01,960 --> 03:08:02,520
Okay...

3844
03:08:03,340 --> 03:08:06,260
So we have two pages of the diary.

3845
03:08:06,440 --> 03:08:08,380
Let's go do the sheet music, I suppose.

3846
03:08:12,720 --> 03:08:13,280
Scary!

3847
03:08:16,920 --> 03:08:18,020
How's our sanity?

3848
03:08:18,240 --> 03:08:18,980
It's pretty low.

3849
03:08:20,500 --> 03:08:21,020
Doing fine.

3850
03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:21,960
What are you looking at?

3851
03:08:22,700 --> 03:08:24,060
What are you looking at?

3852
03:08:24,240 --> 03:08:24,720
What's here?

3853
03:08:26,300 --> 03:08:26,760
Oh!

3854
03:08:28,600 --> 03:08:30,640
Why is he looking up at the wall like that?

3855
03:08:35,230 --> 03:08:36,270
He's not okay.

3856
03:08:37,070 --> 03:08:37,530
Hahaha...

3857
03:08:39,350 --> 03:08:40,190
Alright, Paul.

3858
03:08:40,470 --> 03:08:41,210
Don't worry about it.

3859
03:08:45,320 --> 03:08:46,440
You're a-okay.

3860
03:08:51,300 --> 03:08:51,760
Oh...

3861
03:08:53,720 --> 03:08:54,180
Um...

3862
03:08:54,720 --> 03:08:56,220
Oh, should Paul play the organ?

3863
03:08:57,640 --> 03:08:58,100
Yes.

3864
03:08:59,680 --> 03:09:00,140
Okay.

3865
03:09:15,270 --> 03:09:15,730
Oh...

3866
03:09:23,220 --> 03:09:23,680
Oh...

3867
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:24,000
Oh...

3868
03:09:27,450 --> 03:09:28,350
What is that?

3869
03:09:30,010 --> 03:09:31,090
What is that for real?

3870
03:09:31,870 --> 03:09:32,490
What is that for real?

3871
03:09:34,530 --> 03:09:36,050
That's the first time we've heard that, I think.

3872
03:09:37,870 --> 03:09:38,330
Hahaha...

3873
03:09:38,890 --> 03:09:39,350
Hahaha...

3874
03:09:40,550 --> 03:09:42,890
The tabernacle is almost empty.

3875
03:09:43,150 --> 03:09:48,390
There are none of the things that should be there, such as holy water and other ritualistic items.

3876
03:09:48,630 --> 03:09:51,670
Only a circle of power laying on the lower shelf.

3877
03:09:53,670 --> 03:09:54,310
Oh...

3878
03:09:54,310 --> 03:09:56,510
Oh man, we're powerful!

3879
03:09:59,030 --> 03:10:00,550
Circle of power...

3880
03:10:02,930 --> 03:10:03,570
Oh!

3881
03:10:03,570 --> 03:10:03,810
Oh!

3882
03:10:04,350 --> 03:10:04,630
Oh!

3883
03:10:07,610 --> 03:10:10,870
Paul has acquired a five-point circle of power!

3884
03:10:11,310 --> 03:10:13,370
Oh my gosh, they even have an exclamation point.

3885
03:10:13,550 --> 03:10:14,050
They're like, yeah!

3886
03:10:15,470 --> 03:10:20,370
Now, each of the three-point spells can be powered up by using the power rune!

3887
03:10:25,400 --> 03:10:27,140
I still don't know what this one is.

3888
03:10:27,320 --> 03:10:28,160
I just have it.

3889
03:10:28,980 --> 03:10:30,600
I missed the translation.

3890
03:10:30,680 --> 03:10:31,560
I can't remember.

3891
03:10:31,780 --> 03:10:32,180
Paragon!

3892
03:10:32,280 --> 03:10:32,660
Paragon!

3893
03:10:32,740 --> 03:10:33,160
Paragon!

3894
03:10:36,810 --> 03:10:38,790
I don't have a power-up, though.

3895
03:10:39,090 --> 03:10:39,330
Do I?

3896
03:10:48,920 --> 03:10:50,560
So, what do I do?

3897
03:10:51,400 --> 03:10:52,240
New spell?

3898
03:10:52,500 --> 03:10:53,300
Oh my gosh!

3899
03:10:54,960 --> 03:10:56,880
What do I even create?

3900
03:10:58,940 --> 03:11:00,240
What do I even create?

3901
03:11:02,540 --> 03:11:04,460
We don't have Paragon yet.

3902
03:11:04,580 --> 03:11:05,900
No, we don't have Paragon yet.

3903
03:11:10,200 --> 03:11:11,120
I don't...

3904
03:11:14,700 --> 03:11:14,760
...

3905
03:11:14,760 --> 03:11:15,620
...

3906
03:11:23,340 --> 03:11:24,060
Um.

3907
03:11:24,060 --> 03:11:24,780
Summon...

3908
03:11:25,340 --> 03:11:25,740
...

3909
03:11:25,740 --> 03:11:28,320
... creature...

3910
03:11:28,320 --> 03:11:31,040
... item...

3911
03:11:31,040 --> 03:11:32,400
... and also...

3912
03:11:32,400 --> 03:11:33,600
... myself!

3913
03:11:34,100 --> 03:11:34,700
...

3914
03:11:37,340 --> 03:11:38,060
Oh.

3915
03:11:38,160 --> 03:11:39,080
Tried shield first.

3916
03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:39,900
Oh, that's true!

3917
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:40,980
I haven't done shield.

3918
03:11:41,320 --> 03:11:41,980
...

3919
03:11:41,980 --> 03:11:42,440
...

3920
03:11:44,100 --> 03:11:46,080
Where is that shield...

3921
03:11:46,080 --> 03:11:46,920
...

3922
03:11:51,620 --> 03:11:52,420
Wait, wait.

3923
03:11:57,380 --> 03:11:58,800
People are saying shield is golden.

3924
03:11:59,840 --> 03:12:00,580
Where is it?

3925
03:12:04,960 --> 03:12:06,140
What was... wait, hold on.

3926
03:12:06,180 --> 03:12:06,680
Spell list?

3927
03:12:08,580 --> 03:12:10,360
I already have it, actually.

3928
03:12:10,480 --> 03:12:11,280
Now that I think about it.

3929
03:12:11,340 --> 03:12:11,500
Yeah.

3930
03:12:12,440 --> 03:12:14,300
I already... I don't have to discover it.

3931
03:12:14,380 --> 03:12:14,620
Sorry.

3932
03:12:14,860 --> 03:12:19,820
Oh gosh, my brain is moving at like 2 bpm right now.

3933
03:12:21,180 --> 03:12:23,600
Tattered scroll aligned with curious writing and diagrams.

3934
03:12:23,740 --> 03:12:28,700
It reads, from all manner of magic you will be protected when encased in this...

3935
03:12:31,920 --> 03:12:32,520
Geass?

3936
03:12:32,520 --> 03:12:33,680
What you call me?

3937
03:12:34,440 --> 03:12:36,940
The alignments can help but never hinder.

3938
03:12:37,060 --> 03:12:40,200
For within the well conjured magic comes greater protection.

3939
03:12:49,360 --> 03:12:50,380
Code Geass.

3940
03:12:51,700 --> 03:12:53,180
Two brains per minute?

3941
03:12:53,380 --> 03:12:53,560
Yeah.

3942
03:12:54,140 --> 03:12:54,960
Oh gosh.

3943
03:12:55,820 --> 03:12:56,960
Yeah, two brains per minute.

3944
03:13:00,180 --> 03:13:00,980
So... Alright.

3945
03:13:01,120 --> 03:13:02,020
We have...

3946
03:13:04,400 --> 03:13:04,800
Two...

3947
03:13:06,380 --> 03:13:06,780
Gemi's?

3948
03:13:06,940 --> 03:13:09,500
I think we gotta go back downstairs and fight that guy.

3949
03:13:11,980 --> 03:13:12,380
No!

3950
03:13:12,380 --> 03:13:15,960
When you finish the game, you should look at footage of the N64 version.

3951
03:13:16,140 --> 03:13:18,820
Paul supposedly has a weapon too advanced for the time period?

3952
03:13:21,100 --> 03:13:21,600
Let's go.

3953
03:13:22,600 --> 03:13:24,460
Go back to the first room for a sanity effect.

3954
03:13:26,380 --> 03:13:26,900
Hey...

3955
03:13:26,900 --> 03:13:28,580
Oh... like the room we started out in?

3956
03:13:33,070 --> 03:13:34,750
Did they give Paul a gun?

3957
03:13:34,910 --> 03:13:35,270
For real?

3958
03:13:36,350 --> 03:13:36,370
...

3959
03:13:40,380 --> 03:13:41,940
Ew, what's squelchy in here?

3960
03:13:42,660 --> 03:13:42,740
...

3961
03:13:42,740 --> 03:13:43,660
Oh my god.

3962
03:13:44,060 --> 03:13:44,420
...

3963
03:13:49,890 --> 03:13:50,930
What's squelching?

3964
03:13:51,290 --> 03:13:51,750
...

3965
03:13:54,330 --> 03:13:54,850
Oh!

3966
03:13:55,070 --> 03:13:55,470
...

3967
03:13:55,470 --> 03:13:56,370
...

3968
03:13:57,890 --> 03:13:58,970
Ceiling's leaking again?

3969
03:13:59,210 --> 03:13:59,590
...

3970
03:13:59,590 --> 03:13:59,790
...

3971
03:14:07,540 --> 03:14:08,960
It's like taking a bite.

3972
03:14:15,850 --> 03:14:18,050
It's like taking a bite of an apple or something.

3973
03:14:18,150 --> 03:14:19,850
The random screams are so funny.

3974
03:14:23,250 --> 03:14:24,590
Oh, there's blood here too.

3975
03:14:25,950 --> 03:14:27,290
We're still squelching a little.

3976
03:14:27,750 --> 03:14:30,230
Okay, I think I gotta go downstairs and fight that guy.

3977
03:14:30,670 --> 03:14:31,070
No!

3978
03:14:33,670 --> 03:14:34,850
I don't want to!

3979
03:14:35,270 --> 03:14:36,250
I don't want to!

3980
03:14:36,310 --> 03:14:36,850
I don't want to!

3981
03:14:38,530 --> 03:14:38,930
No!

3982
03:14:52,040 --> 03:14:52,560
Okay.

3983
03:14:52,560 --> 03:14:56,780
It was... not here.

3984
03:14:59,440 --> 03:15:00,700
Invisibility on him?

3985
03:15:01,320 --> 03:15:02,260
We can try.

3986
03:15:03,900 --> 03:15:04,520
Let's see.

3987
03:15:04,580 --> 03:15:06,000
We have so much stuff now.

3988
03:15:06,120 --> 03:15:10,200
I'm thinking I'll probably put up the shield and then crossbow him.

3989
03:15:10,220 --> 03:15:10,460
How many?

3990
03:15:12,860 --> 03:15:15,780
I have 13, but crossbow?

3991
03:15:15,920 --> 03:15:16,280
I don't know.

3992
03:15:16,320 --> 03:15:18,140
Actually, I feel like I should mace him.

3993
03:15:18,420 --> 03:15:19,160
I don't know.

3994
03:15:19,280 --> 03:15:22,340
Well, the crossbow is good, but it's slow, you know, to reload.

3995
03:15:27,280 --> 03:15:29,020
Purple barrier and enchanted mace.

3996
03:15:29,160 --> 03:15:29,320
Oh!

3997
03:15:33,340 --> 03:15:34,620
So true, actually.

3998
03:15:38,580 --> 03:15:39,700
That actually might be good.

3999
03:15:39,920 --> 03:15:40,740
It was blue.

4000
03:15:40,820 --> 03:15:46,220
The guy was blue, so it should be green.

4001
03:15:46,220 --> 03:15:46,620
Okay.

4002
03:15:49,700 --> 03:15:50,280
Hold on.

4003
03:15:50,320 --> 03:15:51,240
Let me make sure where...

4004
03:15:52,820 --> 03:15:54,000
It's this room, right?

4005
03:15:54,660 --> 03:15:55,800
I'm just gonna double check.

4006
03:15:57,080 --> 03:15:58,900
No, it's this room down here.

4007
03:15:58,960 --> 03:15:59,440
Okay, good, good.

4008
03:16:00,100 --> 03:16:01,440
It's this room down here.

4009
03:16:01,800 --> 03:16:04,660
Oh, don't just run in there, Paul.

4010
03:16:04,840 --> 03:16:05,680
Gosh, I'm not ready.

4011
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:06,960
I'm not ready, Paul.

4012
03:16:08,640 --> 03:16:09,920
First, I want to...

4013
03:16:13,620 --> 03:16:14,060
Wait.

4014
03:16:14,060 --> 03:16:15,040
First, I want to...

4015
03:16:15,940 --> 03:16:16,820
Miracle stand.

4016
03:16:17,420 --> 03:16:18,240
Miracle stand.

4017
03:16:18,660 --> 03:16:18,680
Miracle stand.

4018
03:16:19,980 --> 03:16:21,720
Mostly did that for our health.

4019
03:16:22,550 --> 03:16:23,140
Uh-oh.

4020
03:16:23,140 --> 03:16:23,720
Stinky.

4021
03:16:28,120 --> 03:16:28,860
Stinky.

4022
03:16:30,530 --> 03:16:34,120
And I'm gonna... Or I'm gonna enchant and then I'm gonna save.

4023
03:16:36,130 --> 03:16:37,660
Order of operations here.

4024
03:16:37,800 --> 03:16:41,240
So, shield, cast, purple.

4025
03:16:47,450 --> 03:16:47,820
Okay.

4026
03:16:47,940 --> 03:16:52,540
And then, spell, enchant, cast.

4027
03:16:53,380 --> 03:16:56,020
On to you, my mace.

4028
03:17:03,440 --> 03:17:07,640
And then, save the game.

4029
03:17:11,770 --> 03:17:12,490
Yes, indeed.

4030
03:17:13,250 --> 03:17:15,550
I think I'm gonna save over this one too, just in case.

4031
03:17:16,930 --> 03:17:25,830
I'm paranoid now after I had like my memory... or not my memory card, but I had my like game freeze on me yesterday for Metal Gear Solid.

4032
03:17:26,210 --> 03:17:27,870
So... Okay, let's go.

4033
03:17:35,270 --> 03:17:37,110
Oh, uh, he's still hurting me.

4034
03:17:37,170 --> 03:17:37,770
Isn't he?

4035
03:17:38,230 --> 03:17:40,710
Oh, my shield is, uh...

4036
03:17:40,710 --> 03:17:41,190
Ah!

4037
03:17:41,590 --> 03:17:42,590
My shield's gone.

4038
03:17:42,890 --> 03:17:44,510
Um, that's not good.

4039
03:17:45,290 --> 03:17:47,710
Um, that didn't last very long, did it?

4040
03:17:47,870 --> 03:17:49,770
Um, can I make another shield?

4041
03:17:53,430 --> 03:17:54,570
That was so fast.

4042
03:18:00,630 --> 03:18:01,170
Okay, Paul!

4043
03:18:01,350 --> 03:18:02,090
Let's go for it!

4044
03:18:09,600 --> 03:18:10,880
Paul, I think we're gonna die, Paul!

4045
03:18:11,280 --> 03:18:12,880
Oh, he's zapping my energy.

4046
03:18:14,080 --> 03:18:15,940
Oh, he's zapping my magic, that's what's happening.

4047
03:18:16,440 --> 03:18:18,180
Paul, I don't think we're gonna make it, but that's okay.

4048
03:18:19,280 --> 03:18:20,220
You do your best, Paul.

4049
03:18:21,280 --> 03:18:21,600
Um...

4050
03:18:27,750 --> 03:18:29,630
I'm gonna go in with a crossbow.

4051
03:18:30,310 --> 03:18:30,630
Hahaha!

4052
03:18:34,350 --> 03:18:36,590
The only useful shield is red for health.

4053
03:18:36,750 --> 03:18:39,510
Otherwise, you lose shield points every time an enemy sees you.

4054
03:18:40,170 --> 03:18:40,530
Wait, really?

4055
03:18:40,890 --> 03:18:43,010
Paul has perished at the hands of the eternal darkness!

4056
03:18:43,410 --> 03:18:48,070
With no one to stop their diabolical plans, humanity will surely be annihilated!

4057
03:18:49,690 --> 03:18:50,790
Bum bum bum!

4058
03:18:57,340 --> 03:18:58,780
Alright, let's do...

4059
03:19:00,180 --> 03:19:01,060
Crossbow instead.

4060
03:19:03,460 --> 03:19:05,860
It's fine, because I saved right before.

4061
03:19:05,940 --> 03:19:06,340
It's fine, because I saved right before.

4062
03:19:06,340 --> 03:19:06,520
Hahaha!

4063
03:19:08,680 --> 03:19:09,680
I don't...

4064
03:19:09,680 --> 03:19:11,240
Maybe I don't understand the shield.

4065
03:19:12,120 --> 03:19:13,560
The darkness comes!

4066
03:19:14,560 --> 03:19:15,680
I'm so scared.

4067
03:19:19,450 --> 03:19:20,130
Okay.

4068
03:19:26,240 --> 03:19:28,560
But I also should enchant it, maybe?

4069
03:19:54,780 --> 03:19:55,120
Reload.

4070
03:19:56,800 --> 03:19:57,640
Let's just zap him.

4071
03:19:59,660 --> 03:20:00,340
Reload!

4072
03:20:00,360 --> 03:20:00,760
Hahaha!

4073
03:20:06,500 --> 03:20:06,880
Oh!

4074
03:20:06,960 --> 03:20:07,940
I was so close.

4075
03:20:09,760 --> 03:20:10,260
Oh!

4076
03:20:10,280 --> 03:20:11,760
I tried to reload.

4077
03:20:13,680 --> 03:20:14,180
Reload!

4078
03:20:14,620 --> 03:20:15,340
Oh my gosh!

4079
03:20:15,500 --> 03:20:16,360
Run, Paul, run!

4080
03:20:19,900 --> 03:20:20,400
Reload!

4081
03:20:20,400 --> 03:20:20,720
I'm...

4082
03:20:22,100 --> 03:20:23,100
Now reload.

4083
03:20:24,320 --> 03:20:24,820
Reload!

4084
03:20:25,600 --> 03:20:26,440
Oh my gosh.

4085
03:20:26,940 --> 03:20:28,140
This is a little silly.

4086
03:20:28,300 --> 03:20:29,520
I think I'm gonna like...

4087
03:20:29,520 --> 03:20:30,400
Wait!

4088
03:20:30,500 --> 03:20:31,200
What the...

4089
03:20:33,500 --> 03:20:34,000
Huh?

4090
03:20:34,920 --> 03:20:35,420
What?

4091
03:20:50,420 --> 03:20:51,680
The purple poisons?

4092
03:20:54,540 --> 03:20:54,980
Oh!

4093
03:20:55,660 --> 03:20:56,100
Oh!

4094
03:20:56,100 --> 03:20:57,260
Oh my gosh, I only have nine left.

4095
03:20:57,820 --> 03:20:58,520
Oh no!

4096
03:20:58,680 --> 03:20:58,960
Okay.

4097
03:20:59,960 --> 03:21:01,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

4098
03:21:01,960 --> 03:21:02,640
Okay, there we go.

4099
03:21:02,820 --> 03:21:02,900
Haha!

4100
03:21:07,080 --> 03:21:07,520
Yippee!

4101
03:21:07,660 --> 03:21:09,000
We did it!

4102
03:21:09,200 --> 03:21:14,580
You're losing two points of shield per attack from blue horror because it would do health and magic damage.

4103
03:21:15,120 --> 03:21:16,520
Purple protected against bullets.

4104
03:21:17,980 --> 03:21:18,940
I see.

4105
03:21:21,800 --> 03:21:26,460
Hidden in the alcoves of this mausoleum lie the remains of departed monks.

4106
03:21:26,700 --> 03:21:33,600
Some have turned to dust while others have grotesquely withered, leaving husks of bone and leathery skin.

4107
03:21:34,540 --> 03:21:35,100
Okay.

4108
03:21:36,200 --> 03:21:38,080
Why you gotta be so rude to them?

4109
03:21:39,140 --> 03:21:40,400
Is there anybody in here?

4110
03:21:40,680 --> 03:21:41,240
No?

4111
03:21:43,600 --> 03:21:44,160
Okay.

4112
03:21:44,160 --> 03:21:45,840
Let's get this thing.

4113
03:21:45,900 --> 03:21:46,700
Whatever this is.

4114
03:21:47,520 --> 03:21:47,620
Oh!

4115
03:21:48,140 --> 03:21:49,340
This should be...

4116
03:21:49,340 --> 03:21:55,040
The pedestal has three small indentations adorning its top, arranged in a circular formation.

4117
03:21:55,940 --> 03:21:58,640
Each socket appears to be waiting for something.

4118
03:21:58,860 --> 03:22:01,640
I think we have all three.

4119
03:22:02,960 --> 03:22:03,600
Use...

4120
03:22:03,960 --> 03:22:04,280
...

4121
03:22:04,280 --> 03:22:05,220
...

4122
03:22:08,080 --> 03:22:08,720
...

4123
03:22:08,720 --> 03:22:09,140
...

4124
03:22:09,140 --> 03:22:09,300
...

4125
03:22:24,960 --> 03:22:25,560
Okay.

4126
03:22:25,800 --> 03:22:26,460
The music?

4127
03:22:26,600 --> 03:22:27,140
Chill out.

4128
03:22:36,030 --> 03:22:36,810
Here we go.

4129
03:22:43,620 --> 03:22:44,440
Oh my god!

4130
03:22:44,460 --> 03:22:44,880
Tiny guy!

4131
03:22:47,500 --> 03:22:48,440
So tiny!

4132
03:22:52,780 --> 03:22:54,040
You are so small!

4133
03:22:54,460 --> 03:22:56,840
You are so small, little guy!

4134
03:22:59,120 --> 03:23:00,760
Nothing can stop my torch!

4135
03:23:03,920 --> 03:23:05,980
I like to wait until they are dead-dead though.

4136
03:23:06,180 --> 03:23:06,980
Just so that...

4137
03:23:06,980 --> 03:23:09,900
Just in case they try to respawn in this room or something.

4138
03:23:10,100 --> 03:23:10,420
I don't know.

4139
03:23:12,420 --> 03:23:13,880
Yeah, laugh at the small guy.

4140
03:23:14,020 --> 03:23:15,220
Laugh at how small he is.

4141
03:23:15,420 --> 03:23:16,040
Oh my gosh.

4142
03:23:17,100 --> 03:23:18,520
Oh, you're a big guy!

4143
03:23:21,860 --> 03:23:22,540
Doesn't matter!

4144
03:23:31,240 --> 03:23:31,640
Yeah!

4145
03:23:32,900 --> 03:23:33,300
Yeah!

4146
03:23:48,350 --> 03:23:49,510
Is that guy looking at me?

4147
03:23:50,770 --> 03:23:51,530
Oh my god!

4148
03:23:52,190 --> 03:23:53,470
That guy is looking at me!

4149
03:23:54,550 --> 03:23:54,950
Eww!

4150
03:23:55,730 --> 03:23:56,130
Eww!

4151
03:23:56,330 --> 03:23:56,670
Eww!

4152
03:23:56,810 --> 03:23:56,870
Eww!

4153
03:23:59,150 --> 03:24:00,550
What rune did we just get?

4154
03:24:05,500 --> 03:24:05,900
Mystery.

4155
03:24:07,860 --> 03:24:08,900
I think this is the one.

4156
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:09,780
Or... yeah.

4157
03:24:11,140 --> 03:24:12,320
This is the one we just got, right?

4158
03:24:14,840 --> 03:24:15,640
Stop staring!

4159
03:24:21,560 --> 03:24:22,640
Nothing else in here.

4160
03:24:22,720 --> 03:24:22,820
Right?

4161
03:24:23,420 --> 03:24:24,620
Okay, on for it.

4162
03:24:27,540 --> 03:24:29,120
My sanity is so low.

4163
03:24:36,340 --> 03:24:37,140
No, Paul!

4164
03:24:37,180 --> 03:24:37,780
You have to shut up!

4165
03:24:39,360 --> 03:24:40,460
Oh my god, here he comes!

4166
03:24:40,600 --> 03:24:41,100
There he comes!

4167
03:24:41,520 --> 03:24:44,940
Can I light this?

4168
03:24:45,540 --> 03:24:46,000
No.

4169
03:24:48,240 --> 03:24:49,120
Anybody else?

4170
03:24:50,680 --> 03:24:51,860
Anybody else down here?

4171
03:24:53,040 --> 03:24:54,380
Pretty spooky in here.

4172
03:24:58,020 --> 03:24:59,180
Oh my god.

4173
03:25:00,240 --> 03:25:01,100
Wait a second.

4174
03:25:16,420 --> 03:25:18,320
Refill my sanity before going in there.

4175
03:25:18,880 --> 03:25:20,360
Yeah, we might need to...

4176
03:25:21,260 --> 03:25:23,020
We might need to...

4177
03:25:25,560 --> 03:25:26,080
Okay.

4178
03:25:30,230 --> 03:25:32,990
Let's get you up to speed there, buddy.

4179
03:25:33,370 --> 03:25:34,230
Okay, wait.

4180
03:25:34,230 --> 03:25:34,870
Oh...

4181
03:25:35,310 --> 03:25:35,750
Oh...

4182
03:25:37,790 --> 03:25:39,030
Yeah, if I take any...

4183
03:25:39,030 --> 03:25:40,930
Yeah, if I take any sanity damage, it'll...

4184
03:25:40,930 --> 03:25:42,010
Yeah, actually kill me.

4185
03:25:42,310 --> 03:25:43,770
Like, it'll actually take my health.

4186
03:25:45,650 --> 03:25:46,530
Oh, um...

4187
03:25:47,430 --> 03:25:48,190
Oh, shit.

4188
03:25:59,610 --> 03:26:01,630
We're just gonna have to run around and...

4189
03:26:01,630 --> 03:26:03,530
We're just gonna have to run around and...

4190
03:26:04,150 --> 03:26:04,670
We're just gonna have to run around and...

4191
03:26:04,930 --> 03:26:06,210
But there's like so many...

4192
03:26:06,210 --> 03:26:08,690
There were at least two guys in there, right?

4193
03:26:11,450 --> 03:26:11,910
Okay.

4194
03:26:12,910 --> 03:26:13,370
Alright.

4195
03:26:16,470 --> 03:26:18,130
Try making a five star shield.

4196
03:26:18,790 --> 03:26:19,250
Try making a five star shield.

4197
03:26:19,250 --> 03:26:21,290
Wait, I'm gonna run around first and then I'll save again.

4198
03:26:24,570 --> 03:26:26,110
Wait, I'm gonna run around first and then I'll save again.

4199
03:26:26,110 --> 03:26:28,510
Oh yeah, my rod!

4200
03:26:28,690 --> 03:26:28,830
Oh yeah, my rod!

4201
03:26:28,830 --> 03:26:30,070
I forgot about my rod!

4202
03:26:30,070 --> 03:26:30,190
My rod!

4203
03:26:34,370 --> 03:26:35,910
You okay, buddy?

4204
03:26:36,050 --> 03:26:36,750
Don't throw up.

4205
03:26:37,830 --> 03:26:38,490
Don't throw up.

4206
03:26:39,050 --> 03:26:39,890
You're okay.

4207
03:26:42,230 --> 03:26:42,870
Um...

4208
03:26:51,860 --> 03:26:53,060
So, protect?

4209
03:26:57,200 --> 03:26:57,840
Self?

4210
03:27:12,250 --> 03:27:13,950
Then the last rune twice.

4211
03:27:14,390 --> 03:27:14,690
Oh.

4212
03:27:21,010 --> 03:27:22,310
Shield spell.

4213
03:27:22,690 --> 03:27:23,010
Shield spell.

4214
03:27:29,500 --> 03:27:31,340
Five point spell.

4215
03:27:33,160 --> 03:27:34,420
Paragon, paragon!

4216
03:27:35,540 --> 03:27:36,740
Oh my gosh.

4217
03:27:38,760 --> 03:27:39,520
Looks...

4218
03:27:39,520 --> 03:27:43,020
Looks like we don't have that many spells left, really.

4219
03:27:43,420 --> 03:27:44,040
Looks like we don't have that many spells left, really.

4220
03:27:44,040 --> 03:27:44,900
Paragon, paragon.

4221
03:27:47,220 --> 03:27:48,420
Paragon, paragon.

4222
03:27:49,120 --> 03:27:50,280
Paragon, paragon.

4223
03:27:50,620 --> 03:27:52,680
So, if I do everything...

4224
03:27:53,480 --> 03:27:55,760
with paragon, paragon at the end...

4225
03:27:55,760 --> 03:27:57,500
Is it gonna be, like, super powerful?

4226
03:27:59,380 --> 03:28:00,580
And Terbok...

4227
03:28:00,580 --> 03:28:00,880
Mag...

4228
03:28:01,440 --> 03:28:01,900
Or more.

4229
03:28:03,960 --> 03:28:05,160
Oh, new spell.

4230
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:08,600
and...

4231
03:28:08,600 --> 03:28:09,400
And Terok.

4232
03:28:11,620 --> 03:28:13,120
Oh, and Terbok...

4233
03:28:14,260 --> 03:28:14,860
Macklemore.

4234
03:28:17,080 --> 03:28:18,060
Where are you?

4235
03:28:21,260 --> 03:28:22,060
Oh, there.

4236
03:28:22,740 --> 03:28:23,740
Paragon, paragon.

4237
03:28:32,240 --> 03:28:33,560
Oh my god!

4238
03:28:34,620 --> 03:28:35,960
Oh my god!

4239
03:28:45,670 --> 03:28:46,710
Oh gosh!

4240
03:28:46,950 --> 03:28:47,870
I'm sorry, guys.

4241
03:28:47,990 --> 03:28:51,350
I'm really fading fast, but I want to keep playing.

4242
03:28:51,770 --> 03:28:54,210
And I also don't want to go to sleep so early.

4243
03:28:57,070 --> 03:28:59,490
I don't want to have to go through all of these, though.

4244
03:28:59,590 --> 03:29:01,290
It's kind of a pain in the butt, isn't it?

4245
03:29:03,350 --> 03:29:04,310
Recover is...

4246
03:29:06,890 --> 03:29:08,630
Narrow Coth and Sontac.

4247
03:29:10,350 --> 03:29:11,310
Narrow Coth...

4248
03:29:15,770 --> 03:29:16,730
Narrow Coth...

4249
03:29:18,370 --> 03:29:19,330
And Sontac.

4250
03:29:22,350 --> 03:29:22,830
Sontac...

4251
03:29:23,650 --> 03:29:24,130
Bargon!

4252
03:29:24,230 --> 03:29:24,610
Bargon!

4253
03:29:37,000 --> 03:29:37,440
Yeah!

4254
03:29:39,520 --> 03:29:40,940
That one was really clear.

4255
03:29:41,060 --> 03:29:43,640
Sometimes you can't really tell what they're saying, but that one was like...

4256
03:29:44,540 --> 03:29:45,560
Clear as day.

4257
03:29:45,900 --> 03:29:46,340
Oh!

4258
03:29:47,020 --> 03:29:48,280
If I... Okay.

4259
03:29:49,120 --> 03:29:51,380
Is it a Trapper every time?

4260
03:29:54,180 --> 03:29:55,600
Even with these other...

4261
03:29:57,320 --> 03:29:57,760
Spells?

4262
03:29:59,140 --> 03:30:00,540
The blue one and the green one?

4263
03:30:01,380 --> 03:30:01,820
I don't know.

4264
03:30:08,950 --> 03:30:10,510
So it is a Trapper every time.

4265
03:30:14,310 --> 03:30:15,570
But maybe...

4266
03:30:16,170 --> 03:30:17,850
With the five... Let's see.

4267
03:30:17,930 --> 03:30:18,230
Check.

4268
03:30:19,390 --> 03:30:20,110
Uh...

4269
03:30:20,110 --> 03:30:23,610
Tear and Airtac.

4270
03:30:29,440 --> 03:30:30,160
Tear...

4271
03:30:32,360 --> 03:30:33,080
Airtac.

4272
03:30:36,100 --> 03:30:36,820
Bargon!

4273
03:30:36,920 --> 03:30:37,300
Bargon!

4274
03:30:38,700 --> 03:30:39,420
Bargon!

4275
03:30:39,800 --> 03:30:40,520
Bargon!

4276
03:30:40,820 --> 03:30:41,180
Bargon!

4277
03:30:44,360 --> 03:30:45,660
Now what do we have?

4278
03:30:47,040 --> 03:30:47,800
Spell eight?

4279
03:30:48,500 --> 03:30:49,020
Oh!

4280
03:30:49,920 --> 03:30:51,740
I want to cast it.

4281
03:30:52,140 --> 03:30:53,640
I want to cast it, but...

4282
03:30:54,350 --> 03:30:55,600
What is it?

4283
03:30:55,660 --> 03:30:56,620
I'm scared.

4284
03:31:00,530 --> 03:31:02,230
Will it help me in battle?

4285
03:31:06,340 --> 03:31:07,260
Let's try it.

4286
03:31:17,330 --> 03:31:18,800
I summoned a man!

4287
03:31:19,260 --> 03:31:20,480
Oh no way!

4288
03:31:20,480 --> 03:31:21,980
I shouldn't have picked red!

4289
03:31:22,420 --> 03:31:23,860
Oh no!

4290
03:31:24,140 --> 03:31:25,480
I'm going to have to kill him afterwards!

4291
03:31:25,940 --> 03:31:27,400
Press A to attack enemies.

4292
03:31:28,060 --> 03:31:29,860
Attacks can be targeted using R.

4293
03:31:30,320 --> 03:31:33,040
Attack an enemy's head to perform a gnaw attack.

4294
03:31:35,460 --> 03:31:36,500
Press L...

4295
03:31:37,780 --> 03:31:39,000
Okay, so run.

4296
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:42,040
Zombies can open doors, but not pick up items.

4297
03:31:44,100 --> 03:31:44,920
Here I go.

4298
03:31:46,900 --> 03:31:48,640
They're not going to suspect it's me.

4299
03:31:53,320 --> 03:31:54,460
I think they're fighting.

4300
03:31:57,920 --> 03:31:59,020
The girls are fighting.

4301
03:31:59,200 --> 03:31:59,380
Hey!

4302
03:32:00,300 --> 03:32:01,300
I'm just a zombie.

4303
03:32:02,560 --> 03:32:02,980
Hey!

4304
03:32:04,420 --> 03:32:05,240
Don't mind me.

4305
03:32:06,120 --> 03:32:06,940
I'm a zombie.

4306
03:32:07,020 --> 03:32:09,200
I also don't know how to go upstairs apparently.

4307
03:32:09,540 --> 03:32:09,660
Oh!

4308
03:32:09,680 --> 03:32:10,300
Yes I do.

4309
03:32:10,420 --> 03:32:10,600
Ah!

4310
03:32:10,900 --> 03:32:11,520
Hold on!

4311
03:32:11,640 --> 03:32:11,960
Hold on!

4312
03:32:11,960 --> 03:32:12,260
Hold on!

4313
03:32:12,720 --> 03:32:13,140
Gosh!

4314
03:32:13,840 --> 03:32:14,500
Hold on!

4315
03:32:16,300 --> 03:32:16,720
Oh!

4316
03:32:16,940 --> 03:32:18,200
He won't let me get close to him.

4317
03:32:18,320 --> 03:32:18,620
Oh!

4318
03:32:23,730 --> 03:32:24,250
Uh...

4319
03:32:28,350 --> 03:32:28,870
Uh...

4320
03:32:28,870 --> 03:32:29,570
If I...

4321
03:32:34,490 --> 03:32:35,010
Hmm...

4322
03:32:36,470 --> 03:32:36,990
Uh...

4323
03:32:38,610 --> 03:32:39,130
Uh...

4324
03:32:39,130 --> 03:32:39,730
Uh...

4325
03:32:39,730 --> 03:32:39,910
Uh...

4326
03:32:41,290 --> 03:32:41,810
Uh...

4327
03:32:41,810 --> 03:32:45,530
But now I have to deal with this zombie.

4328
03:32:53,720 --> 03:32:55,300
Now I have to deal with this guy.

4329
03:32:56,720 --> 03:32:57,860
Where else can we go?

4330
03:32:59,000 --> 03:32:59,520
Look!

4331
03:32:59,520 --> 03:33:00,340
That doesn't seem like a door.

4332
03:33:01,220 --> 03:33:04,080
Okay, so now we know that there's just the red guys left though.

4333
03:33:04,860 --> 03:33:06,060
So we're gonna have to...

4334
03:33:06,820 --> 03:33:08,320
Let the big guy kill you.

4335
03:33:08,400 --> 03:33:09,740
No, he's only draining my sanity.

4336
03:33:09,940 --> 03:33:11,360
He's not killing me.

4337
03:33:19,680 --> 03:33:21,600
He's only draining... does... maybe...

4338
03:33:32,200 --> 03:33:33,080
Oh, shoot!

4339
03:33:33,300 --> 03:33:34,000
I got a hit in!

4340
03:33:39,180 --> 03:33:40,060
My zombie!

4341
03:33:51,240 --> 03:33:53,740
Dang, he took a good amount of sanity too.

4342
03:33:54,720 --> 03:33:56,880
We got in a single hit, everybody.

4343
03:33:57,300 --> 03:33:57,800
Let's go.

4344
03:33:58,100 --> 03:33:58,420
Yeah, you got in a single hit.

4345
03:33:58,440 --> 03:33:59,480
Oh, he really did do his job.

4346
03:33:59,900 --> 03:34:01,360
I'm actually quite proud of him.

4347
03:34:03,120 --> 03:34:04,800
So for this guy...

4348
03:34:05,490 --> 03:34:07,900
Mr. Red...

4349
03:34:08,410 --> 03:34:09,820
I'm scared of using the mace.

4350
03:34:09,880 --> 03:34:10,880
I feel like I'm not gonna...

4351
03:34:10,880 --> 03:34:13,040
I feel like I'm not gonna...

4352
03:34:21,960 --> 03:34:23,560
Let's see if I...

4353
03:34:29,240 --> 03:34:30,060
Enchant item.

4354
03:34:32,560 --> 03:34:34,040
We're gonna enchant our mace.

4355
03:34:35,200 --> 03:34:36,660
Okay, we've got the mace.

4356
03:34:37,440 --> 03:34:38,480
It's almost the last one.

4357
03:34:38,700 --> 03:34:39,100
Good.

4358
03:34:43,680 --> 03:34:43,820
I think I can actually get this one.

4359
03:34:43,820 --> 03:34:45,640
Okay, and then I'm gonna also...

4360
03:34:45,640 --> 03:34:46,320
Oh, I don't have enough.

4361
03:34:46,700 --> 03:34:47,500
As a shield.

4362
03:34:48,320 --> 03:34:49,140
If I die.

4363
03:34:49,560 --> 03:34:53,360
Then I will come back and do it all over again.

4364
03:35:00,980 --> 03:35:01,380
Oh.

4365
03:35:08,190 --> 03:35:09,550
I'm not doing a very good job at it.

4366
03:35:11,830 --> 03:35:12,230
Hmm.

4367
03:35:12,910 --> 03:35:14,270
I'm trying to hit him, but I'm not...

4368
03:35:14,270 --> 03:35:14,490
Ah!

4369
03:35:16,410 --> 03:35:17,650
Maybe I can hold out?

4370
03:35:17,970 --> 03:35:19,750
And he can poison to death.

4371
03:35:23,750 --> 03:35:24,110
Ow!

4372
03:35:24,110 --> 03:35:25,170
Oh, don't die, Paul!

4373
03:35:25,630 --> 03:35:25,990
Paul!

4374
03:35:26,470 --> 03:35:27,510
Paul, just let him...

4375
03:35:27,510 --> 03:35:29,410
Oh gosh, Paul, I think we're done, Zo.

4376
03:35:29,430 --> 03:35:29,670
Wait.

4377
03:35:35,130 --> 03:35:35,850
Oh, Paul.

4378
03:35:36,130 --> 03:35:36,590
Oh, Paul.

4379
03:35:36,650 --> 03:35:37,270
I think we're dead.

4380
03:35:37,470 --> 03:35:38,330
I think we're dead.

4381
03:35:38,450 --> 03:35:41,410
Oh my god.

4382
03:35:41,890 --> 03:35:42,490
Oh my god.

4383
03:35:42,530 --> 03:35:43,330
Just let him...

4384
03:35:43,330 --> 03:35:44,610
Oh, he's slow, he's slow.

4385
03:35:55,330 --> 03:35:56,290
Dang it.

4386
03:35:58,630 --> 03:35:59,110
Paul...

4387
03:36:01,470 --> 03:36:01,950
Paul!

4388
03:36:06,000 --> 03:36:06,620
It's okay.

4389
03:36:07,000 --> 03:36:07,760
It's all good.

4390
03:36:12,600 --> 03:36:13,360
Let's see.

4391
03:36:15,020 --> 03:36:16,300
This is the one, yeah.

4392
03:36:18,960 --> 03:36:19,440
Paul!

4393
03:36:19,940 --> 03:36:22,920
This is what happens when Colonel is on his mission.

4394
03:36:24,040 --> 03:36:26,520
And accidentally... accidentally dies.

4395
03:36:27,860 --> 03:36:28,300
So...

4396
03:36:31,520 --> 03:36:33,700
Let's get my magic up a little.

4397
03:36:33,960 --> 03:36:35,400
Just gonna run up and down the stairs.

4398
03:36:37,820 --> 03:36:39,360
How do we want to approach this?

4399
03:36:39,420 --> 03:36:40,460
This is like so tricky.

4400
03:36:40,700 --> 03:36:43,880
Before we had our shotguns, it was really nice.

4401
03:36:45,280 --> 03:36:47,560
Now all we have is Paul's wit.

4402
03:36:47,560 --> 03:36:48,980
Or his might.

4403
03:36:51,580 --> 03:36:52,580
Come on, Paul.

4404
03:36:52,820 --> 03:36:55,460
We need you to really... you know...

4405
03:36:57,620 --> 03:36:59,000
80s training montage.

4406
03:37:02,860 --> 03:37:05,220
This is Paul's idol training.

4407
03:37:05,600 --> 03:37:08,200
He's training to become Love Live.

4408
03:37:09,860 --> 03:37:11,520
Oh my god, he doesn't sound so good.

4409
03:37:15,700 --> 03:37:16,320
Okay.

4410
03:37:28,940 --> 03:37:30,100
Almost

4411
03:37:33,380 --> 03:37:34,540
there.

4412
03:37:37,380 --> 03:37:41,020
I will also do a spell...

4413
03:37:41,160 --> 03:37:41,740
Wait.

4414
03:37:41,860 --> 03:37:43,020
Recover.

4415
03:37:46,800 --> 03:37:48,200
Recover.

4416
03:37:49,420 --> 03:37:50,500
Recover.

4417
03:37:51,860 --> 03:37:53,140
Recover.

4418
03:37:53,140 --> 03:37:53,880
Recover.

4419
03:37:53,880 --> 03:37:53,980
Recover.

4420
03:37:53,980 --> 03:37:54,020
Recover.

4421
03:37:54,660 --> 03:37:55,360
Recover.

4422
03:37:55,360 --> 03:37:55,720
Recover.

4423
03:37:55,720 --> 03:37:55,900
Recover.

4424
03:37:56,580 --> 03:37:57,980
Recover.

4425
03:38:04,600 --> 03:38:05,300
Recover.

4426
03:38:06,000 --> 03:38:06,860
Recover.

4427
03:38:07,940 --> 03:38:08,140
Recover.

4428
03:38:09,100 --> 03:38:10,500
Recover.

4429
03:38:11,180 --> 03:38:12,580
Recover.

4430
03:38:12,580 --> 03:38:15,440
Just evil church things, you know?

4431
03:38:15,480 --> 03:38:15,760
Whatever.

4432
03:38:16,300 --> 03:38:17,640
Love me some Paragon.

4433
03:38:17,900 --> 03:38:18,440
Hell yeah.

4434
03:38:18,620 --> 03:38:20,080
Can I get a Paragon in the chat?

4435
03:38:23,000 --> 03:38:24,500
Can we all say...

4436
03:38:25,220 --> 03:38:25,740
Paragon!

4437
03:38:26,780 --> 03:38:27,300
Paragon!

4438
03:38:32,650 --> 03:38:34,030
I hope one day...

4439
03:38:35,050 --> 03:38:37,170
if it hasn't happened already...

4440
03:38:37,170 --> 03:38:39,130
that somebody plays this game at...

4441
03:38:40,710 --> 03:38:41,750
at AGDQ...

4442
03:38:41,750 --> 03:38:43,650
and then instead of, can I get a hype...

4443
03:38:43,650 --> 03:38:44,690
can I get a Paragon?

4444
03:38:45,090 --> 03:38:47,730
Everyone's just like, Paragon, Paragon...

4445
03:38:47,730 --> 03:38:48,370
Paragon...

4446
03:38:50,430 --> 03:38:51,450
Okay, alright.

4447
03:38:51,590 --> 03:38:52,450
Our magic is full.

4448
03:38:53,130 --> 03:38:54,550
Our sanity is full.

4449
03:38:54,590 --> 03:38:55,290
Our health is full.

4450
03:39:00,060 --> 03:39:00,960
It has been.

4451
03:39:01,800 --> 03:39:02,780
There was a...

4452
03:39:02,780 --> 03:39:03,440
speedrun of it.

4453
03:39:14,760 --> 03:39:15,660
Um, okay.

4454
03:39:18,460 --> 03:39:20,140
Now I can at least shield.

4455
03:39:20,320 --> 03:39:21,700
I can shield and mace.

4456
03:39:23,200 --> 03:39:24,120
So let's...

4457
03:39:24,640 --> 03:39:25,100
do that.

4458
03:39:26,740 --> 03:39:28,860
Uh, the game is bleeding...

4459
03:39:28,860 --> 03:39:29,040
again.

4460
03:39:29,220 --> 03:39:29,600
Sorry.

4461
03:39:30,460 --> 03:39:32,580
Let Paragons be Paragons.

4462
03:39:35,000 --> 03:39:36,680
Um, enchant item...

4463
03:39:36,680 --> 03:39:37,480
cast...

4464
03:39:38,780 --> 03:39:40,120
purple to mace.

4465
03:39:41,180 --> 03:39:41,740
I...

4466
03:39:42,800 --> 03:39:44,760
wanna try mace one more time.

4467
03:39:46,640 --> 03:39:49,080
Actually, before I do that, I'm gonna save...

4468
03:39:50,900 --> 03:39:52,440
so that we have all my...

4469
03:39:52,440 --> 03:39:53,900
stuff maxed, you know?

4470
03:39:57,120 --> 03:39:58,720
The speedrun is interesting...

4471
03:39:58,720 --> 03:40:00,360
but it loses a lot because it revolves around...

4472
03:40:00,360 --> 03:40:02,080
managing your sanity to make sure there are no...

4473
03:40:02,640 --> 03:40:04,080
time waste of events.

4474
03:40:04,840 --> 03:40:05,380
Ahhhh...

4475
03:40:05,380 --> 03:40:07,140
That makes sense though.

4476
03:40:07,780 --> 03:40:08,720
That does make sense.

4477
03:40:08,940 --> 03:40:10,680
I keep closing out of the menu.

4478
03:40:11,200 --> 03:40:11,740
Okay.

4479
03:40:12,360 --> 03:40:12,900
Mace!

4480
03:40:25,350 --> 03:40:26,160
And also...

4481
03:40:27,160 --> 03:40:27,700
shield.

4482
03:40:31,580 --> 03:40:32,120
Oh!

4483
03:40:33,580 --> 03:40:34,420
Noooo!

4484
03:40:36,120 --> 03:40:39,860
I accidentally touched my...

4485
03:40:39,860 --> 03:40:41,260
My finger...

4486
03:40:41,260 --> 03:40:42,640
slipped!

4487
03:40:43,440 --> 03:40:46,540
My finger slipped.

4488
03:40:49,260 --> 03:40:50,660
Ahhhh!

4489
03:40:51,740 --> 03:40:53,140
Noooo!

4490
03:40:53,220 --> 03:40:55,100
My finger slipped on my controller.

4491
03:40:55,760 --> 03:40:56,600
Hmm...

4492
03:40:57,580 --> 03:40:59,120
Um...

4493
03:40:59,120 --> 03:40:59,880
Load save.

4494
03:41:01,060 --> 03:41:02,140
Should be okay.

4495
03:41:04,240 --> 03:41:04,960
Um...

4496
03:41:06,840 --> 03:41:07,560
Ohhhh...

4497
03:41:09,080 --> 03:41:09,440
Um...

4498
03:41:09,800 --> 03:41:10,560
Load save.

4499
03:41:10,940 --> 03:41:11,180
Hahaha!

4500
03:41:16,370 --> 03:41:17,090
Yippee!

4501
03:41:17,330 --> 03:41:18,770
The dark just comes!

4502
03:41:19,790 --> 03:41:20,210
Hahaha!

4503
03:41:21,950 --> 03:41:23,350
Blue recover spell.

4504
03:41:23,490 --> 03:41:26,230
But okay, shouldn't it be purple so that I can be...

4505
03:41:26,230 --> 03:41:27,850
protected against everything?

4506
03:41:28,970 --> 03:41:31,270
Why should I do a blue recover spell?

4507
03:41:31,970 --> 03:41:34,250
I know he's blue, but...

4508
03:41:34,250 --> 03:41:38,980
Why should I do a blue recover spell?

4509
03:41:38,980 --> 03:41:39,540
Why should I do a blue recover spell?

4510
03:41:39,540 --> 03:41:39,960
Oh, recover.

4511
03:41:40,400 --> 03:41:41,280
Not shield.

4512
03:41:41,540 --> 03:41:41,880
Ohhhh!

4513
03:41:48,930 --> 03:41:50,590
Well, not... I don't need an owl.

4514
03:41:50,950 --> 03:41:51,530
Um...

4515
03:41:52,290 --> 03:41:52,970
Okay.

4516
03:41:55,010 --> 03:41:56,110
Alright, shield.

4517
03:41:56,810 --> 03:41:56,970
Alright, shield.

4518
03:41:58,410 --> 03:42:00,210
Alright, shield.

4519
03:42:00,710 --> 03:42:01,990
Sleepy as yod.

4520
03:42:02,450 --> 03:42:02,790
I'm...

4521
03:42:03,930 --> 03:42:06,310
I'm telling you, when I'm tired...

4522
03:42:06,310 --> 03:42:08,670
I'm so tired today.

4523
03:42:11,110 --> 03:42:13,910
But I'm trying to get through it.

4524
03:42:14,030 --> 03:42:14,150
But I'm trying to get through it.

4525
03:42:14,150 --> 03:42:14,250
But I'm trying to get through it.

4526
03:42:14,250 --> 03:42:14,590
Okay.

4527
03:42:15,250 --> 03:42:15,850
Mace.

4528
03:42:21,550 --> 03:42:23,570
So sorry if I'm a little, uh...

4529
03:42:23,570 --> 03:42:24,530
So sorry if I'm a little, uh...

4530
03:42:24,530 --> 03:42:25,830
Extra, you know...

4531
03:42:25,830 --> 03:42:26,330
Extra, you know...

4532
03:42:27,570 --> 03:42:28,170
Dummy.

4533
03:42:29,390 --> 03:42:29,990
Dummy.

4534
03:42:44,140 --> 03:42:45,500
My spell is gone!

4535
03:42:45,560 --> 03:42:46,520
Or my shield is gone!

4536
03:42:49,400 --> 03:42:50,000
Oh!

4537
03:42:51,020 --> 03:42:51,620
Oh!

4538
03:42:52,020 --> 03:42:52,540
Oh!

4539
03:42:52,540 --> 03:42:52,680
Yippee!

4540
03:42:53,040 --> 03:42:54,180
Oh my gosh, Paul!

4541
03:42:54,420 --> 03:42:55,140
You did it!

4542
03:42:56,400 --> 03:42:59,020
I got... I got some crossbow bolts.

4543
03:43:00,640 --> 03:43:01,240
Yeah!

4544
03:43:01,500 --> 03:43:02,080
Yeah!

4545
03:43:02,360 --> 03:43:02,720
Yeah!

4546
03:43:04,500 --> 03:43:05,840
Good job, Paul!

4547
03:43:05,940 --> 03:43:06,840
Good job, Paul!

4548
03:43:08,400 --> 03:43:09,360
What is this?

4549
03:43:10,060 --> 03:43:10,520
Oh!

4550
03:43:10,660 --> 03:43:11,740
Oh, it's a piggy bank.

4551
03:43:12,540 --> 03:43:14,380
An effigy of a monk...

4552
03:43:14,380 --> 03:43:16,600
reclining on the sacrificial altar.

4553
03:43:16,800 --> 03:43:18,260
A deep groove...

4554
03:43:18,260 --> 03:43:19,460
bisects...

4555
03:43:20,340 --> 03:43:20,940
bisects...

4556
03:43:20,940 --> 03:43:22,540
its chest.

4557
03:43:26,760 --> 03:43:27,960
Uh...

4558
03:43:29,820 --> 03:43:30,420
Bisects...

4559
03:43:31,020 --> 03:43:31,860
bisects...

4560
03:43:31,860 --> 03:43:32,120
bisects...

4561
03:43:32,120 --> 03:43:33,060
bisects...

4562
03:43:33,060 --> 03:43:33,880
bisects...

4563
03:43:33,880 --> 03:43:34,480
bisects...

4564
03:43:41,400 --> 03:43:45,060
You know what I was saying!

4565
03:43:48,100 --> 03:43:50,960
You know what I was saying!

4566
03:43:50,960 --> 03:43:54,260
This face looks almost exactly like the custodian!

4567
03:43:54,420 --> 03:43:54,460
This face looks almost exactly like the custodian!

4568
03:43:54,460 --> 03:43:56,260
The inscription reads...

4569
03:43:56,260 --> 03:44:03,380
Only when thy friend is sacrificed, when his cries fill the air, will the great doors be opened to thee.

4570
03:44:03,520 --> 03:44:05,760
Do I have to sacrifice the custodian?

4571
03:44:07,640 --> 03:44:08,620
No way.

4572
03:44:09,500 --> 03:44:10,640
That's my buddy.

4573
03:44:15,360 --> 03:44:16,700
What is growling?

4574
03:44:17,880 --> 03:44:18,860
Excuse me?

4575
03:44:19,120 --> 03:44:19,140
Excuse me?

4576
03:44:20,960 --> 03:44:21,200
The door is locked?

4577
03:44:25,160 --> 03:44:26,680
There's something in that box!

4578
03:44:26,820 --> 03:44:27,660
What about this one?

4579
03:44:31,080 --> 03:44:33,780
Oh, Mantarok Enchantment makes a growling sound when you hit!

4580
03:44:34,200 --> 03:44:35,000
Oh my gosh!

4581
03:44:35,240 --> 03:44:36,100
That's so funny!

4582
03:44:37,100 --> 03:44:38,440
It's about to be...

4583
03:44:39,040 --> 03:44:40,660
Oh wait, I was gonna hit save.

4584
03:44:40,780 --> 03:44:40,980
Sorry.

4585
03:44:44,420 --> 03:44:45,180
Save's coming!

4586
03:44:45,180 --> 03:44:45,380
Coming!

4587
03:44:47,700 --> 03:44:48,380
Oh!

4588
03:44:48,380 --> 03:44:48,600
Ah!

4589
03:44:50,000 --> 03:44:50,680
Ah!

4590
03:44:50,880 --> 03:44:51,160
Ah!

4591
03:44:51,520 --> 03:44:51,800
Ah!

4592
03:44:51,920 --> 03:44:52,380
Ah!

4593
03:45:02,300 --> 03:45:03,920
I hit him!

4594
03:45:04,020 --> 03:45:05,760
He was like...

4595
03:45:08,660 --> 03:45:11,880
A 10 don't know for a 10 out of 10.

4596
03:45:12,000 --> 03:45:13,620
Oh, Paige!

4597
03:45:20,880 --> 03:45:21,860
Thank you!

4598
03:45:22,800 --> 03:45:23,200
Why?

4599
03:45:24,360 --> 03:45:25,100
What happened?

4600
03:45:27,680 --> 03:45:29,060
Why are we being nice, huh?

4601
03:45:29,620 --> 03:45:30,840
Why are we being nice to Minto?

4602
03:45:40,650 --> 03:45:41,050
Okay.

4603
03:45:43,310 --> 03:45:44,790
Oh shoot, it's these guys.

4604
03:45:44,990 --> 03:45:45,350
Dang it!

4605
03:45:47,450 --> 03:45:48,650
Hold on, let's go enchant.

4606
03:45:48,790 --> 03:45:49,510
Let's go enchant!

4607
03:45:51,810 --> 03:45:52,330
Thank you!

4608
03:45:57,620 --> 03:46:02,340
Enchant My Messa!

4609
03:46:05,800 --> 03:46:08,520
It kinda sounds like they're saying Pekora Paragon.

4610
03:46:08,740 --> 03:46:09,980
Okay!

4611
03:46:11,520 --> 03:46:13,720
Here I go!

4612
03:46:13,820 --> 03:46:14,900
So...

4613
03:46:14,900 --> 03:46:15,180
Bow!

4614
03:46:16,100 --> 03:46:16,800
Bow!

4615
03:46:22,700 --> 03:46:25,180
Take that!

4616
03:46:25,180 --> 03:46:25,360
Yeah!

4617
03:46:34,260 --> 03:46:35,760
You don't get your head back.

4618
03:46:36,000 --> 03:46:36,620
No head!

4619
03:46:37,380 --> 03:46:38,020
Yeah!

4620
03:46:46,940 --> 03:46:53,040
As further proof of the heresy within this dark cathedral, a table bears arcane documents.

4621
03:46:53,780 --> 03:47:00,180
Diagrams and sigils pertaining to demonic craft are scattered across the recently used table.

4622
03:47:00,780 --> 03:47:02,720
Heresy, heresy, heresy, heresy!

4623
03:47:02,920 --> 03:47:04,180
Oh my gosh, we got crossbows.

4624
03:47:05,220 --> 03:47:05,860
Wow!

4625
03:47:09,660 --> 03:47:10,180
Um...

4626
03:47:13,400 --> 03:47:13,920
Uh...

4627
03:47:14,660 --> 03:47:16,620
Yeah, we have all the evidence we need, I think.

4628
03:47:17,100 --> 03:47:20,060
Arcane documents and treatments of the demonic arts.

4629
03:47:20,260 --> 03:47:23,980
Paul daren't touch them for fear of the taint of evil.

4630
03:47:25,800 --> 03:47:27,880
I'm also afraid of the evil taint.

4631
03:47:31,660 --> 03:47:32,180
What?

4632
03:47:32,240 --> 03:47:33,660
This is a door, isn't it?

4633
03:47:33,940 --> 03:47:37,640
Da... The shelf appears to be recessed into the wall.

4634
03:47:38,260 --> 03:47:40,900
Not quite as flush as the others in the room.

4635
03:47:41,000 --> 03:47:42,320
Almost as if it could slide inward.

4636
03:47:42,740 --> 03:47:43,300
Yes.

4637
03:47:48,760 --> 03:47:49,480
I'm scared.

4638
03:47:50,440 --> 03:47:51,480
Oh, um...

4639
03:47:53,120 --> 03:47:55,500
I shouldn't be... I have...

4640
03:47:55,500 --> 03:47:57,260
my torch!

4641
03:48:03,140 --> 03:48:05,160
I was just hitting the wall.

4642
03:48:05,260 --> 03:48:06,860
Could've been better.

4643
03:48:06,860 --> 03:48:07,900
Thank you so much for the $50,000!

4644
03:48:08,040 --> 03:48:08,600
Thank you!

4645
03:48:09,620 --> 03:48:10,900
Thank you so much!

4646
03:48:15,600 --> 03:48:16,280
Okay.

4647
03:48:17,460 --> 03:48:18,140
Onward.

4648
03:48:23,980 --> 03:48:27,320
I remember this area, kind of.

4649
03:48:28,060 --> 03:48:29,760
I don't remember what I...

4650
03:48:29,760 --> 03:48:33,200
Like, I remember each room as like...

4651
03:48:34,300 --> 03:48:35,840
We continue onward.

4652
03:48:35,860 --> 03:48:36,180
You know?

4653
03:48:43,010 --> 03:48:43,610
Okay.

4654
03:48:43,710 --> 03:48:45,290
Those are my footsteps.

4655
03:48:46,030 --> 03:48:47,330
Oh my gosh!

4656
03:48:47,510 --> 03:48:48,550
This looks like... What?

4657
03:48:51,130 --> 03:48:53,070
Tucked into a niche within the wall!

4658
03:48:53,110 --> 03:48:53,670
A stone tablet!

4659
03:48:55,230 --> 03:48:55,830
Awww...

4660
03:48:55,830 --> 03:48:56,910
Paragon!

4661
03:48:58,730 --> 03:48:59,330
Yeah!

4662
03:49:00,110 --> 03:49:05,170
By adding Paragon runes to a spell, it can be powered up, intensifying its effects!

4663
03:49:05,170 --> 03:49:05,910
Yeah!

4664
03:49:06,990 --> 03:49:07,330
Paragon!

4665
03:49:08,930 --> 03:49:09,670
Let's go!

4666
03:49:11,530 --> 03:49:13,210
This seems to be...

4667
03:49:14,930 --> 03:49:15,870
Holy texts.

4668
03:49:17,330 --> 03:49:20,630
A torn diary page has been placed on the shrine.

4669
03:49:21,110 --> 03:49:24,870
It says Paragon, Paragon, Paragon, Paragon, Paragon, over and over again.

4670
03:49:25,710 --> 03:49:27,330
I've got the diary page!

4671
03:49:30,090 --> 03:49:31,370
Now what does it say?

4672
03:49:32,770 --> 03:49:33,630
For real.

4673
03:49:33,750 --> 03:49:34,390
Page 3.

4674
03:49:36,050 --> 03:49:38,290
The diary of Brother Andrew.

4675
03:49:38,490 --> 03:49:39,430
Page 3.

4676
03:49:40,170 --> 03:49:41,970
I would give my life for Paragon.

4677
03:49:42,090 --> 03:49:42,950
Don't do that!

4678
03:49:44,210 --> 03:49:45,310
Don't do it!

4679
03:49:46,790 --> 03:49:47,850
Funky Nighty!

4680
03:49:47,870 --> 03:49:48,450
Welcome to membership!

4681
03:49:48,650 --> 03:49:49,530
Thank you so much!

4682
03:49:50,370 --> 03:49:53,150
With a shudder, my heart turned to ice.

4683
03:49:53,410 --> 03:49:58,630
I came to the brutal realization that the entire Order were heretics!

4684
03:49:58,630 --> 03:50:02,330
And that I was in incredible jeopardy.

4685
03:50:02,510 --> 03:50:09,270
Who knows how long they had kept their dark secret, masquerading as custodians of the Hand of Jude.

4686
03:50:10,410 --> 03:50:14,350
When in fact, they guarded a damnable relic.

4687
03:50:14,370 --> 03:50:16,950
The essence of the unholy...

4688
03:50:16,950 --> 03:50:18,250
...

4689
03:50:18,250 --> 03:50:18,590
...

4690
03:50:20,400 --> 03:50:20,750
...

4691
03:50:20,750 --> 03:50:21,710
...

4692
03:50:21,710 --> 03:50:21,750
...

4693
03:50:29,090 --> 03:50:29,970
Use IT!

4694
03:50:35,990 --> 03:50:40,010
Whenever you see IT capitalized, I think of IT.

4695
03:50:43,470 --> 03:50:48,130
Use IT to lure potential victims to their hideous sacrifice.

4696
03:50:48,590 --> 03:50:49,670
I felt sick.

4697
03:50:49,910 --> 03:50:53,570
And despite my faith, I felt intense fear and hopelessness.

4698
03:50:53,770 --> 03:50:57,450
I know that I must escape this place before they suspect my knowledge.

4699
03:50:57,630 --> 03:51:01,870
I must warn the world and notify the real inquisition of their presence.

4700
03:51:03,170 --> 03:51:04,210
Knowing death...

4701
03:51:04,210 --> 03:51:05,850
Yeah, Paul does not know what a computer is.

4702
03:51:10,370 --> 03:51:15,070
Knowing death is just around the corner and fearing every moment, I commit these words to paper.

4703
03:51:16,410 --> 03:51:18,250
Augustine will find this book.

4704
03:51:18,410 --> 03:51:25,750
I will remove certain pages and hide them, so that all who may follow might discover the truth before it is too late.

4705
03:51:26,590 --> 03:51:27,150
...

4706
03:51:28,450 --> 03:51:31,270
I think we've got all the evidence we need, baby.

4707
03:51:32,110 --> 03:51:32,390
...

4708
03:51:33,910 --> 03:51:36,190
I think it's time to go back to the bell tower.

4709
03:51:36,890 --> 03:51:38,130
And talk with...

4710
03:51:38,910 --> 03:51:40,030
the custodian.

4711
03:51:40,790 --> 03:51:41,350
...

4712
03:51:41,350 --> 03:51:45,830
Which sounds like a secret boss, you know?

4713
03:51:45,910 --> 03:51:46,930
The custodian.

4714
03:51:48,130 --> 03:51:48,690
...

4715
03:51:50,210 --> 03:51:51,230
Let's keep going.

4716
03:51:52,430 --> 03:51:52,990
Alrighty.

4717
03:51:53,910 --> 03:51:57,010
Oh, but I think we have to sacrifice our friend, don't we?

4718
03:51:58,670 --> 03:51:59,150
Custodian!

4719
03:51:59,970 --> 03:52:01,990
It doesn't look anything like him.

4720
03:52:02,070 --> 03:52:03,050
It says it looks like him.

4721
03:52:03,130 --> 03:52:06,450
I don't know about that.

4722
03:52:09,150 --> 03:52:13,290
I think a custodian is much more handsome.

4723
03:52:14,230 --> 03:52:15,030
I don't know.

4724
03:52:16,350 --> 03:52:17,350
I don't know.

4725
03:52:21,850 --> 03:52:23,170
Oh, he's still looking at me.

4726
03:52:23,170 --> 03:52:25,030
Is my sanity that low?

4727
03:52:26,790 --> 03:52:27,150
...

4728
03:52:27,150 --> 03:52:28,270
...

4729
03:52:29,170 --> 03:52:29,510
...

4730
03:52:33,770 --> 03:52:34,690
Oh, wait.

4731
03:52:34,950 --> 03:52:37,230
Let me replace that with, um...

4732
03:52:38,730 --> 03:52:41,230
with the five star one.

4733
03:52:42,970 --> 03:52:43,650
Recover.

4734
03:52:43,650 --> 03:52:44,330
Assign.

4735
03:52:44,390 --> 03:52:45,250
Five star.

4736
03:52:46,330 --> 03:52:46,890
To you.

4737
03:52:47,070 --> 03:52:47,910
Oh, to you.

4738
03:52:48,370 --> 03:52:48,910
There we go.

4739
03:52:49,070 --> 03:52:49,450
Okay.

4740
03:52:53,110 --> 03:52:53,790
Oh.

4741
03:52:53,790 --> 03:52:55,330
Now we're normal!

4742
03:52:55,670 --> 03:52:55,910
Yeah!

4743
03:52:56,150 --> 03:52:57,190
We're normal!

4744
03:52:58,710 --> 03:52:59,250
...

4745
03:52:59,650 --> 03:52:59,990
...

4746
03:53:00,790 --> 03:53:01,470
...

4747
03:53:02,890 --> 03:53:04,810
Unless it's just, you know...

4748
03:53:04,810 --> 03:53:06,450
I mean, we're in a fantastical world.

4749
03:53:06,630 --> 03:53:11,830
I would assume that sometimes statues stare at you.

4750
03:53:11,930 --> 03:53:12,970
I think it's just normal.

4751
03:53:14,250 --> 03:53:18,770
Camera angles, please.

4752
03:53:19,910 --> 03:53:20,590
...

4753
03:53:20,590 --> 03:53:20,610
Alright.

4754
03:53:21,830 --> 03:53:23,130
Go back upstairs.

4755
03:53:24,710 --> 03:53:25,390
...

4756
03:53:26,790 --> 03:53:27,510
You lost interest!

4757
03:53:29,170 --> 03:53:32,830
I think the statue realized I'm out of his league.

4758
03:53:33,730 --> 03:53:34,070
...

4759
03:53:34,990 --> 03:53:36,790
It's not a matter of losing interest.

4760
03:53:36,890 --> 03:53:37,870
He's very much interested.

4761
03:53:38,090 --> 03:53:39,290
He's just like, Oh, gosh.

4762
03:53:40,530 --> 03:53:41,730
I don't think I can...

4763
03:53:41,730 --> 03:53:43,230
I don't think I'm worthy.

4764
03:53:43,890 --> 03:53:44,950
Did I go in here?

4765
03:53:45,930 --> 03:53:47,110
Yes, I did go in there.

4766
03:53:47,250 --> 03:53:47,750
Just kidding.

4767
03:53:48,550 --> 03:53:48,990
...

4768
03:53:50,830 --> 03:53:52,030
And then we...

4769
03:53:53,230 --> 03:53:54,230
Oh, sorry, Paul.

4770
03:53:54,610 --> 03:53:56,970
Making you... I'm really putting you to work.

4771
03:53:57,250 --> 03:53:57,610
...

4772
03:53:59,970 --> 03:54:01,530
Sorry, I'm checking the map real quick.

4773
03:54:02,410 --> 03:54:02,770
...

4774
03:54:03,270 --> 03:54:05,030
The bell tower...

4775
03:54:05,030 --> 03:54:05,490
...

4776
03:54:08,470 --> 03:54:09,530
Didn't lead anywhere.

4777
03:54:09,670 --> 03:54:10,650
Yeah, we just gotta go back.

4778
03:54:11,110 --> 03:54:11,470
...

4779
03:54:15,610 --> 03:54:15,970
...

4780
03:54:18,250 --> 03:54:20,130
Yeah, Paul's got some crazy stamina.

4781
03:54:20,270 --> 03:54:20,830
Yeah, he does.

4782
03:54:21,350 --> 03:54:22,010
Oh, my bad.

4783
03:54:22,570 --> 03:54:22,930
...

4784
03:54:22,930 --> 03:54:23,030
...

4785
03:54:26,590 --> 03:54:28,030
This way...

4786
03:54:28,030 --> 03:54:31,590
Friend, I have three pages of diary.

4787
03:54:31,950 --> 03:54:32,350
...

4788
03:54:32,350 --> 03:54:33,210
...

4789
03:54:33,210 --> 03:54:38,190
And they're all going to prove that...

4790
03:54:38,930 --> 03:54:39,450
...

4791
03:54:39,450 --> 03:54:40,890
...

4792
03:54:40,890 --> 03:54:41,090
...

4793
03:54:41,090 --> 03:54:41,550
...

4794
03:54:41,550 --> 03:54:41,710
...

4795
03:54:41,710 --> 03:54:42,650
...

4796
03:55:06,720 --> 03:55:10,960
Thanks, girl.

4797
03:55:24,380 --> 03:55:27,180
It's okay.

4798
03:55:27,540 --> 03:55:30,820
Mm-hmm!

4799
03:55:41,360 --> 03:55:41,920
Murdered!

4800
03:55:45,480 --> 03:55:46,460
Oh, my God!

4801
03:55:46,520 --> 03:55:47,080
It was a trap!

4802
03:55:49,520 --> 03:55:50,080
Ah!

4803
03:55:53,900 --> 03:55:54,460
No...

4804
03:55:58,180 --> 03:55:59,300
What the...

4805
03:56:02,620 --> 03:56:03,780
What does that... what?

4806
03:56:04,820 --> 03:56:06,080
They want you to do it?

4807
03:56:07,420 --> 03:56:08,240
Oh, my gosh.

4808
03:56:08,460 --> 03:56:09,360
They gave you a weapon.

4809
03:56:09,460 --> 03:56:09,740
Fight back!

4810
03:56:12,020 --> 03:56:15,020
Can you speak up?

4811
03:56:15,020 --> 03:56:19,200
Please, take this thing away from me.

4812
03:56:19,360 --> 03:56:22,260
Its very sight troubles me to no end.

4813
03:56:23,780 --> 03:56:29,400
May your faith protect thee, Brother Luther, for that's all you have.

4814
03:56:33,700 --> 03:56:35,540
I have a feeling...

4815
03:56:36,820 --> 03:56:38,180
Okay, we're stomping away.

4816
03:56:40,580 --> 03:56:41,700
What's going on?

4817
03:56:42,380 --> 03:56:43,000
Oh, my gosh!

4818
03:56:43,120 --> 03:56:43,820
Custodian, watch out!

4819
03:56:46,880 --> 03:56:48,940
Paul has been given a sacrificial knife.

4820
03:56:51,020 --> 03:56:51,380
Wait.

4821
03:56:52,680 --> 03:56:54,180
If I go back, what's gonna happen?

4822
03:56:57,100 --> 03:56:57,780
Oh, he's gone.

4823
03:57:03,720 --> 03:57:04,080
Okay.

4824
03:57:04,680 --> 03:57:09,260
I have a feeling that if we use it, like we stick it in the statue, you know?

4825
03:57:10,080 --> 03:57:15,420
And it's going to kill him in real life, you know?

4826
03:57:17,800 --> 03:57:20,440
I don't think Custodian is a bad guy, right?

4827
03:57:24,120 --> 03:57:25,300
He's not a bad guy.

4828
03:57:25,500 --> 03:57:26,200
He's on our...

4829
03:57:32,260 --> 03:57:33,220
Where'd you come from?

4830
03:57:39,660 --> 03:57:40,600
I don't know.

4831
03:57:42,140 --> 03:57:43,600
Trust Master Miller.

4832
03:57:43,860 --> 03:57:44,200
Oh, yeah.

4833
03:57:44,240 --> 03:57:45,440
He is voiced by Cam Clark.

4834
03:57:45,900 --> 03:57:47,460
He's literally voiced by Liquid.

4835
03:57:51,020 --> 03:57:51,920
Oh, my gosh.

4836
03:57:52,000 --> 03:57:52,980
We got fresh meat.

4837
03:57:55,360 --> 03:57:56,700
What are you staring at?

4838
03:57:58,360 --> 03:58:00,320
Oh, I hate these.

4839
03:58:07,830 --> 03:58:10,270
Can I use this as like a weapon?

4840
03:58:11,950 --> 03:58:13,490
Ornate long-bladed knife.

4841
03:58:13,630 --> 03:58:14,090
Used to...

4842
03:58:14,090 --> 03:58:15,710
Used to sacrifice humans.

4843
03:58:15,950 --> 03:58:18,030
For Paul to even pick it up is repulsive.

4844
03:58:18,310 --> 03:58:21,210
For the sense of evil it emits is intense.

4845
03:58:21,590 --> 03:58:22,510
And unnerving.

4846
03:58:22,550 --> 03:58:25,970
The souls this blade has taken live on within its metal.

4847
03:58:28,050 --> 03:58:29,610
Sounds like I should be using it.

4848
03:58:31,110 --> 03:58:32,390
Try the green shield.

4849
03:58:32,710 --> 03:58:33,790
Oh, okay.

4850
03:58:36,530 --> 03:58:37,090
Shield.

4851
03:58:39,250 --> 03:58:39,810
So...

4852
03:58:41,370 --> 03:58:44,930
So, if I cast a spell upon myself...

4853
03:58:45,630 --> 03:58:47,090
Am I casting it...

4854
03:58:49,050 --> 03:58:51,710
of the same thing that the creature is?

4855
03:58:51,810 --> 03:58:53,150
So, it would be green to green?

4856
03:58:53,850 --> 03:58:56,310
Like, I'm casting a spell of green against green?

4857
03:58:57,130 --> 03:58:58,430
Is that how it works?

4858
03:58:58,530 --> 03:59:00,330
For the shield, at least?

4859
03:59:03,270 --> 03:59:04,570
Or do I do the opposite?

4860
03:59:05,290 --> 03:59:06,290
I cannot tell.

4861
03:59:09,070 --> 03:59:10,110
I cannot tell.

4862
03:59:19,790 --> 03:59:21,610
Green message for green woman.

4863
03:59:23,950 --> 03:59:25,730
Shield protects the same color...

4864
03:59:25,730 --> 03:59:26,170
bar.

4865
03:59:26,750 --> 03:59:27,790
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

4866
03:59:27,870 --> 03:59:28,230
Thank you.

4867
03:59:28,490 --> 03:59:29,470
That's all I need to know.

4868
03:59:30,990 --> 03:59:31,890
Bar, bar.

4869
03:59:45,770 --> 03:59:46,590
Yeah!

4870
03:59:46,870 --> 03:59:47,710
Get it, Paul!

4871
03:59:48,130 --> 03:59:48,970
Get him, Paul!

4872
03:59:50,330 --> 03:59:51,150
Yeah!

4873
03:59:51,450 --> 03:59:52,910
The way he just like...

4874
03:59:54,100 --> 03:59:56,250
Flails his arm, his whole body out.

4875
03:59:57,980 --> 04:00:01,050
Now I'm officially a geriatric.

4876
04:00:01,980 --> 04:00:03,710
Happy birthday, Gilnick!

4877
04:00:08,120 --> 04:00:08,690
Oh, wait.

4878
04:00:09,410 --> 04:00:12,560
Happy birthday to you.

4879
04:00:14,490 --> 04:00:17,150
Happy birthday to you.

4880
04:00:18,330 --> 04:00:21,330
Happy birthday, dear Gilnick.

4881
04:00:23,430 --> 04:00:26,630
Happy birthday to you.

4882
04:00:30,050 --> 04:00:31,590
You're very old.

4883
04:00:31,790 --> 04:00:32,350
No, I'm just kidding.

4884
04:00:32,570 --> 04:00:33,270
You're still young.

4885
04:00:33,330 --> 04:00:34,070
Don't worry.

4886
04:00:35,390 --> 04:00:36,050
Oh, wait.

4887
04:00:36,130 --> 04:00:36,630
Um...

4888
04:00:37,150 --> 04:00:37,430
Okay.

4889
04:00:38,110 --> 04:00:39,450
Yes, we're going back into the basement.

4890
04:00:45,650 --> 04:00:46,690
Who's in here?

4891
04:00:47,570 --> 04:00:48,210
Anybody?

4892
04:00:50,010 --> 04:00:50,650
Anyone?

4893
04:00:51,970 --> 04:00:53,030
Anybody in here?

4894
04:00:53,930 --> 04:00:54,570
Anyone?

4895
04:00:54,790 --> 04:00:55,630
Anybody in here?

4896
04:00:56,650 --> 04:00:57,290
Anybody?

4897
04:00:57,510 --> 04:00:58,450
Anybody in?

4898
04:01:02,500 --> 04:01:03,640
I hear something.

4899
04:01:05,360 --> 04:01:06,440
Maybe I don't.

4900
04:01:07,580 --> 04:01:08,220
Um...

4901
04:01:09,860 --> 04:01:11,560
Let's go down.

4902
04:01:14,690 --> 04:01:16,030
So now we take the stairs.

4903
04:01:16,030 --> 04:01:18,410
We take the knife to that statue we saw earlier, right?

4904
04:01:19,630 --> 04:01:20,470
The one...

4905
04:01:21,950 --> 04:01:24,670
That has the little slot in it.

4906
04:01:25,430 --> 04:01:27,170
The one that yearns for the knife.

4907
04:01:28,470 --> 04:01:29,110
Oh my gosh.

4908
04:01:40,180 --> 04:01:40,860
Oh, look.

4909
04:01:40,940 --> 04:01:43,540
We have just like one little swirly now.

4910
04:01:43,780 --> 04:01:44,940
Oh, I see how it works.

4911
04:01:45,000 --> 04:01:45,820
So it was like...

4912
04:01:46,980 --> 04:01:48,120
It was three.

4913
04:01:50,940 --> 04:01:51,820
Now it's...

4914
04:01:51,820 --> 04:01:52,780
Or it was five.

4915
04:01:53,620 --> 04:01:54,180
Before...

4916
04:01:54,180 --> 04:01:55,400
The other shield was three.

4917
04:01:55,600 --> 04:01:56,700
I see how it works.

4918
04:01:58,140 --> 04:01:59,780
Just one little guy left.

4919
04:02:11,700 --> 04:02:12,260
Actually...

4920
04:02:22,110 --> 04:02:23,430
How do I sneak again?

4921
04:02:23,550 --> 04:02:23,850
Sorry.

4922
04:02:23,930 --> 04:02:24,810
I'm going to check the controller.

4923
04:02:25,470 --> 04:02:26,030
Uh...

4924
04:02:26,030 --> 04:02:27,610
Sneak is X.

4925
04:02:28,010 --> 04:02:28,470
Okay.

4926
04:02:29,390 --> 04:02:29,950
X.

4927
04:02:31,130 --> 04:02:31,690
Yes.

4928
04:02:39,130 --> 04:02:39,850
That's better.

4929
04:02:39,870 --> 04:02:40,210
Thanks.

4930
04:02:40,210 --> 04:02:41,310
Thanks for the 20 gifted.

4931
04:02:41,870 --> 04:02:42,730
I feel like...

4932
04:02:42,730 --> 04:02:43,250
You know...

4933
04:02:43,250 --> 04:02:47,470
It's just easier probably to handle them like that.

4934
04:02:51,930 --> 04:02:52,670
Okay.

4935
04:02:59,730 --> 04:03:00,470
Alright.

4936
04:03:00,690 --> 04:03:01,350
To the statue.

4937
04:03:04,030 --> 04:03:05,510
Which is...

4938
04:03:06,270 --> 04:03:07,010
Ouch.

4939
04:03:07,530 --> 04:03:08,270
Ouch.

4940
04:03:12,600 --> 04:03:13,340
Ouch.

4941
04:03:16,740 --> 04:03:17,480
Ouch.

4942
04:03:22,230 --> 04:03:22,790
Hayden!

4943
04:03:22,970 --> 04:03:24,010
Thanks for the five gifted!

4944
04:03:24,390 --> 04:03:24,990
Thank you!

4945
04:03:26,450 --> 04:03:27,390
We're still okay.

4946
04:03:27,530 --> 04:03:27,890
We're still okay.

4947
04:03:28,750 --> 04:03:29,310
Alright.

4948
04:03:29,390 --> 04:03:29,950
Dissolve.

4949
04:03:30,030 --> 04:03:30,470
Dissolve.

4950
04:03:30,490 --> 04:03:30,930
Dissolve.

4951
04:03:31,030 --> 04:03:31,590
Dissolve.

4952
04:03:32,790 --> 04:03:34,330
What is your aim?

4953
04:03:35,090 --> 04:03:35,650
Um...

4954
04:03:36,230 --> 04:03:37,170
It's not me.

4955
04:03:37,430 --> 04:03:37,950
It's...

4956
04:03:37,950 --> 04:03:38,910
It's Paul.

4957
04:03:40,850 --> 04:03:43,150
You're insulting an old man right now.

4958
04:03:44,750 --> 04:03:46,050
He needs glasses.

4959
04:03:46,270 --> 04:03:46,550
Okay?

4960
04:03:47,370 --> 04:03:48,630
It's not his fault.

4961
04:03:48,770 --> 04:03:48,950
Okay.

4962
04:03:48,970 --> 04:03:50,200
Oh gosh.

4963
04:03:51,070 --> 04:03:51,610
Okay.

4964
04:03:51,630 --> 04:03:52,670
But this is the room we need to be in.

4965
04:03:55,130 --> 04:03:56,210
Do I...

4966
04:03:56,210 --> 04:03:57,230
Enchant?

4967
04:04:05,360 --> 04:04:05,900
Yeah.

4968
04:04:06,200 --> 04:04:07,460
We can...

4969
04:04:09,860 --> 04:04:10,400
Enchant.

4970
04:04:11,480 --> 04:04:12,140
Oh wait.

4971
04:04:12,260 --> 04:04:13,100
It would be...

4972
04:04:13,100 --> 04:04:14,160
Fire.

4973
04:04:20,780 --> 04:04:22,380
Oh I guess I could have done purple.

4974
04:04:22,600 --> 04:04:23,440
I'm so stupid.

4975
04:04:23,620 --> 04:04:24,160
I'm so stupid.

4976
04:04:25,100 --> 04:04:25,700
Whatever.

4977
04:04:25,880 --> 04:04:26,560
It's fine.

4978
04:04:34,440 --> 04:04:35,940
Holy... Holy cow!

4979
04:04:36,360 --> 04:04:38,360
Oh my gosh, we obliterated him!

4980
04:04:39,820 --> 04:04:41,220
We obliterated him!

4981
04:04:41,260 --> 04:04:41,720
That's crazy!

4982
04:04:42,440 --> 04:04:44,100
Oh, direct counter is stronger.

4983
04:04:44,360 --> 04:04:44,980
Okay, okay, okay.

4984
04:04:46,500 --> 04:04:47,100
Dang.

4985
04:04:48,140 --> 04:04:48,740
Okay!

4986
04:04:50,120 --> 04:04:50,720
Custodian!

4987
04:04:51,660 --> 04:04:53,720
I must sacrifice my friend!

4988
04:05:03,430 --> 04:05:04,090
Are

4989
04:05:07,380 --> 04:05:08,280
you okay?

4990
04:05:08,780 --> 04:05:11,220
The monk in the effigy has been sacrificed!

4991
04:05:11,700 --> 04:05:15,240
A dagger protrudes from a deep groove within his chest.

4992
04:05:15,460 --> 04:05:19,240
The echoes of his scream still reverberate in Paul's ears.

4993
04:05:28,470 --> 04:05:30,140
Do you guys think he's okay?

4994
04:05:32,900 --> 04:05:33,500
Oops.

4995
04:05:48,320 --> 04:05:49,520
It's like...

4996
04:05:57,890 --> 04:05:58,790
What is this?

4997
04:06:07,260 --> 04:06:10,280
Paul's progress forward is blocked by a corrosive spell.

4998
04:06:10,500 --> 04:06:13,000
Obviously someone wants to keep intruders at bay.

4999
04:06:13,160 --> 04:06:16,040
And this lethal magic is just a way to do it.

5000
04:06:17,820 --> 04:06:20,240
I have a spell for that!

5001
04:06:24,800 --> 04:06:25,760
Dispel magic!

5002
04:06:26,140 --> 04:06:28,880
But I think I need a five one, so let's...

5003
04:06:29,960 --> 04:06:30,040
Check.

5004
04:06:31,040 --> 04:06:31,680
Um...

5005
04:06:31,680 --> 04:06:34,400
Nethlek Redgormor.

5006
04:06:34,840 --> 04:06:35,480
Okay.

5007
04:06:38,140 --> 04:06:38,780
Um...

5008
04:06:42,480 --> 04:06:43,120
Reth...lek...

5009
04:06:45,820 --> 04:06:46,460
Reth...

5010
04:06:46,460 --> 04:06:47,640
Reth...

5011
04:06:47,640 --> 04:06:48,580
Wait.

5012
04:06:49,580 --> 04:06:51,700
Is it one of the question mark ones?

5013
04:06:51,840 --> 04:06:52,100
Uh-oh.

5014
04:06:54,820 --> 04:06:55,460
Redgormor?

5015
04:06:59,220 --> 04:07:00,060
He's red?

5016
04:07:01,060 --> 04:07:01,960
Well, it's fine.

5017
04:07:02,080 --> 04:07:03,500
As long as I learn it, I can still...

5018
04:07:03,500 --> 04:07:04,000
Is it this one?

5019
04:07:04,420 --> 04:07:05,020
Let's try it.

5020
04:07:07,260 --> 04:07:07,740
Oh, wait.

5021
04:07:07,800 --> 04:07:08,160
No, no, no!

5022
04:07:16,240 --> 04:07:18,180
It doesn't matter which one I learn, you guys.

5023
04:07:20,060 --> 04:07:21,000
Because it's still...

5024
04:07:21,000 --> 04:07:21,520
Oh, there we go.

5025
04:07:21,820 --> 04:07:22,180
Um...

5026
04:07:22,640 --> 04:07:23,800
I can still use it.

5027
04:07:23,860 --> 04:07:24,560
Dispel magic.

5028
04:07:24,760 --> 04:07:25,120
Cast.

5029
04:07:26,160 --> 04:07:26,520
Red.

5030
04:07:27,300 --> 04:07:27,660
Red.

5031
04:07:28,360 --> 04:07:28,720
Red.

5032
04:07:28,740 --> 04:07:29,100
Red.

5033
04:07:29,580 --> 04:07:29,940
Red.

5034
04:07:29,940 --> 04:07:30,520
Watcha doing out here.

5035
04:07:33,680 --> 04:07:34,940
Uh-oh.

5036
04:07:34,940 --> 04:07:36,040
What a pain in the ass.

5037
04:07:37,780 --> 04:07:38,460
Ah...

5038
04:07:39,880 --> 04:07:43,260
All good.

5039
04:07:44,180 --> 04:07:45,600
And I'll continue.

5040
04:07:46,720 --> 04:07:48,060
So there shouldn't be anything else.

5041
04:07:48,120 --> 04:07:48,540
I mean...

5042
04:07:48,540 --> 04:07:51,720
That spell was so hard to get through.

5043
04:07:51,800 --> 04:07:53,880
They wouldn't need any other protective measures.

5044
04:07:54,160 --> 04:07:54,980
You know?

5045
04:07:56,960 --> 04:07:58,740
But that's a person.

5046
04:08:01,280 --> 04:08:01,960
Ahhhh!

5047
04:08:04,080 --> 04:08:11,240
Lying in a pool of his own blood is the Custodian, Paul's only ally in his fight against the darkness.

5048
04:08:11,540 --> 04:08:16,980
His soul no doubt lingers, fused to the altar on which his life has been taken.

5049
04:08:20,800 --> 04:08:23,740
Watching over his own rapidly cooling corpse.

5050
04:08:24,180 --> 04:08:29,080
Feeling all hope escape him, Paul's situation is suddenly a thousand times more desperate than before.

5051
04:08:29,080 --> 04:08:33,640
Now he is alone, alone against the darkness.

5052
04:08:37,040 --> 04:08:40,880
You are a clever man, Brother Luther.

5053
04:08:42,060 --> 04:08:46,020
Wanting answers to clarify your new position as fugitive.

5054
04:08:46,880 --> 04:08:49,800
You seek them out, and this is what you find.

5055
04:08:53,880 --> 04:08:57,720
Tell me, what does a man such as yourself think?

5056
04:08:59,080 --> 04:09:01,480
When he finds a viper's nest of heresy.

5057
04:09:01,640 --> 04:09:03,780
When he finds the very source of corruption.

5058
04:09:05,180 --> 04:09:07,340
I think of irony.

5059
04:09:08,900 --> 04:09:15,240
Irony of what you, masquerading as a member of the Inquisition, stand for.

5060
04:09:15,740 --> 04:09:19,320
And that you stand for evil.

5061
04:09:19,700 --> 04:09:26,960
Evil is merely a perspective which no longer concerns me, Luther.

5062
04:09:26,960 --> 04:09:32,040
You will be executed in the most painful manner imaginable.

5063
04:09:32,040 --> 04:09:33,860
How does anyone look at this guy and think he's okay?

5064
04:09:34,440 --> 04:09:35,920
After you have broken your frail body.

5065
04:09:36,160 --> 04:09:37,140
And mine.

5066
04:09:37,460 --> 04:09:38,520
No, don't mind break me.

5067
04:09:38,520 --> 04:09:39,880
In the name of our true Lord.

5068
04:09:40,900 --> 04:09:41,460
Xelaton!

5069
04:09:42,060 --> 04:09:42,620
Xelaton!

5070
04:09:43,120 --> 04:09:44,580
Come, my children.

5071
04:09:45,120 --> 04:09:45,580
Uh oh.

5072
04:09:45,780 --> 04:09:47,720
Feast on this morsel.

5073
04:09:48,000 --> 04:09:48,580
Uh oh, wait.

5074
04:09:48,660 --> 04:09:51,380
And let us return to our preparation.

5075
04:09:51,820 --> 04:09:52,280
Oh wait, no.

5076
04:09:52,380 --> 04:09:53,060
Don't do that.

5077
04:09:55,840 --> 04:09:56,440
Ew.

5078
04:09:57,520 --> 04:09:58,120
Oh.

5079
04:09:59,200 --> 04:09:59,800
Oh.

5080
04:10:00,580 --> 04:10:04,360
We have to send in the worst ones.

5081
04:10:06,620 --> 04:10:07,260
Oh, okay.

5082
04:10:07,560 --> 04:10:09,280
They're just...

5083
04:10:09,880 --> 04:10:12,260
Oh, why do you have to send in the worst guys?

5084
04:10:12,640 --> 04:10:14,040
I hate these guys.

5085
04:10:14,200 --> 04:10:15,700
Oh, our thing is still...

5086
04:10:15,700 --> 04:10:18,300
Uh, hopefully it stays, um...

5087
04:10:19,300 --> 04:10:20,100
What's the word?

5088
04:10:20,320 --> 04:10:20,920
Enchanted?

5089
04:10:26,060 --> 04:10:26,900
Ow!

5090
04:10:33,560 --> 04:10:34,840
No, no, no!

5091
04:10:36,820 --> 04:10:37,660
Oh.

5092
04:10:41,640 --> 04:10:42,280
Finish him!

5093
04:10:42,960 --> 04:10:43,800
Oh.

5094
04:10:43,820 --> 04:10:44,240
Ow!

5095
04:10:44,420 --> 04:10:45,080
Oh my god, again?

5096
04:10:45,420 --> 04:10:46,660
Get off of me!

5097
04:10:49,780 --> 04:10:51,540
I can not reach...

5098
04:10:52,480 --> 04:10:53,320
Oh!

5099
04:10:55,160 --> 04:10:56,260
Oh, we got him, we got him.

5100
04:10:56,540 --> 04:10:57,800
Finish him!

5101
04:11:02,960 --> 04:11:04,120
Yeah, take that.

5102
04:11:07,320 --> 04:11:09,160
Oh, Custodian, I'm so sorry.

5103
04:11:09,880 --> 04:11:11,400
I knew it was going to happen.

5104
04:11:11,740 --> 04:11:13,160
I still did it.

5105
04:11:13,240 --> 04:11:13,940
It's my fault.

5106
04:11:17,200 --> 04:11:18,380
It's okay, I'll get revenge.

5107
04:11:21,100 --> 04:11:22,980
Can I save in here?

5108
04:11:23,560 --> 04:11:26,700
I know I just saved, but... you know me.

5109
04:11:27,940 --> 04:11:29,400
I'm a save queen.

5110
04:11:31,620 --> 04:11:32,700
Yeah, now what?

5111
04:11:32,900 --> 04:11:36,920
I actually feel like that should have been the end of the chapter.

5112
04:11:37,180 --> 04:11:40,240
But now I'm just like...

5113
04:11:40,780 --> 04:11:45,100
So we... our friend that was going to help us is gone.

5114
04:11:46,420 --> 04:11:46,940
And...

5115
04:11:49,760 --> 04:11:51,180
Oh, there's this door!

5116
04:11:51,340 --> 04:11:51,800
Of course.

5117
04:11:52,160 --> 04:11:53,140
Oh, my sassy.

5118
04:11:57,060 --> 04:11:58,360
We just go on in there.

5119
04:12:01,240 --> 04:12:02,820
I'm following with you!

5120
04:12:03,040 --> 04:12:04,280
Friendly right behind you!

5121
04:12:05,700 --> 04:12:06,540
He's fast.

5122
04:12:07,600 --> 04:12:08,460
What did you do?

5123
04:12:08,500 --> 04:12:09,020
Run in there?

5124
04:12:10,140 --> 04:12:11,020
What's the rush?

5125
04:12:11,280 --> 04:12:11,800
What's the hurry?

5126
04:12:15,740 --> 04:12:17,180
Where did he go?

5127
04:12:20,340 --> 04:12:20,860
Okay.

5128
04:12:26,460 --> 04:12:29,320
Why do these look like the hallways of like the...

5129
04:12:29,860 --> 04:12:33,420
Those look like the stairs and then the hallways of like the ancient temple.

5130
04:12:37,920 --> 04:12:38,440
Oh!

5131
04:12:38,440 --> 04:12:39,920
That's a mysterious door.

5132
04:12:41,460 --> 04:12:44,920
This door is decorated more than most within the catacombs.

5133
04:12:45,080 --> 04:12:51,340
Sensing an immense evil behind this door, Paul wonders if the ceremony the monk had mentioned earlier is taking place behind it.

5134
04:12:51,440 --> 04:12:54,120
Should Paul enter and put an end to the heresy?

5135
04:12:54,120 --> 04:12:54,720
Okay.

5136
04:12:56,420 --> 04:12:57,300
Yes, but...

5137
04:12:58,400 --> 04:12:59,620
In like two seconds.

5138
04:12:59,740 --> 04:13:00,420
Okay, hold on, Paul.

5139
04:13:00,680 --> 04:13:01,440
Hold on, Paul.

5140
04:13:01,520 --> 04:13:02,000
We got some...

5141
04:13:02,000 --> 04:13:02,560
We got some...

5142
04:13:03,820 --> 04:13:05,240
We have some things...

5143
04:13:05,240 --> 04:13:06,580
Some matters to handle first.

5144
04:13:12,480 --> 04:13:12,920
Yeah!

5145
04:13:13,860 --> 04:13:16,580
Nobody heard that from inside the room.

5146
04:13:16,880 --> 04:13:18,180
Also, it was so loud.

5147
04:13:18,320 --> 04:13:18,680
Hold on.

5148
04:13:18,720 --> 04:13:19,260
I'm so sorry.

5149
04:13:20,420 --> 04:13:23,460
I turned it up a little bit because the audio was a little loud.

5150
04:13:23,820 --> 04:13:25,620
I mean, a little low and then...

5151
04:13:26,740 --> 04:13:29,600
The audio balancing in this game is...

5152
04:13:31,060 --> 04:13:33,960
A little less than it would be desired, but you know.

5153
04:13:34,880 --> 04:13:36,280
Actually, I am gonna save.

5154
04:13:37,360 --> 04:13:38,080
And see.

5155
04:13:39,340 --> 04:13:40,400
And then just go in.

5156
04:13:40,620 --> 04:13:43,220
And if I die, which I probably will...

5157
04:13:43,220 --> 04:13:45,720
I can just see what I need to like enchant and stuff.

5158
04:13:47,560 --> 04:13:48,360
Once I'm done.

5159
04:13:49,340 --> 04:13:49,980
You know?

5160
04:13:56,260 --> 04:13:56,740
Whoa!

5161
04:13:57,140 --> 04:13:57,900
Kingdom Hearts!

5162
04:14:00,180 --> 04:14:00,980
Oh, that's...

5163
04:14:00,980 --> 04:14:01,980
Oh, that...

5164
04:14:04,440 --> 04:14:04,920
Paul...

5165
04:14:04,920 --> 04:14:07,440
If your name is Paul, you're so lucky right now.

5166
04:14:09,240 --> 04:14:10,000
I forgot.

5167
04:14:13,800 --> 04:14:16,440
If your name is Luther right now, you're so lucky.

5168
04:14:17,460 --> 04:14:20,980
I forgot that there's this big thing in here that we're gonna have to fight.

5169
04:14:21,080 --> 04:14:22,060
Okay, so this is...

5170
04:14:22,060 --> 04:14:23,380
Going to be a battle.

5171
04:14:25,400 --> 04:14:26,660
Okay, so this is a...

5172
04:14:26,660 --> 04:14:28,100
This is quite a battle, isn't it?

5173
04:14:28,200 --> 04:14:28,460
Okay.

5174
04:14:29,740 --> 04:14:30,780
Oh my gosh.

5175
04:14:31,580 --> 04:14:33,460
Shout out to all the Pauls today.

5176
04:14:35,900 --> 04:14:36,420
One

5177
04:14:55,830 --> 04:14:58,910
that seeks to do combat with me.

5178
04:14:59,770 --> 04:15:00,290
Ooh!

5179
04:15:01,230 --> 04:15:05,090
Your task, my liege and greater guardian, is to guard this place.

5180
04:15:05,710 --> 04:15:07,890
Do not worry about this worm.

5181
04:15:08,410 --> 04:15:08,930
Worm?

5182
04:15:08,930 --> 04:15:09,350
Oh!

5183
04:15:09,390 --> 04:15:11,670
It is my yelps in terror at the sight of your mightiness.

5184
04:15:12,130 --> 04:15:13,390
We will dispose of you.

5185
04:15:13,450 --> 04:15:14,930
We will give him our souls.

5186
04:15:19,130 --> 04:15:20,150
Uh-oh!

5187
04:15:20,490 --> 04:15:21,630
Oh my god, no!

5188
04:15:21,770 --> 04:15:22,110
Oh!

5189
04:15:27,110 --> 04:15:32,990
If I am to guard this place, then I will do it as I see fit.

5190
04:15:33,470 --> 04:15:34,790
Be gone.

5191
04:15:35,190 --> 04:15:36,390
Leave me.

5192
04:15:36,690 --> 04:15:41,090
And I will guard this artifact as you have instructed.

5193
04:15:44,670 --> 04:15:45,350
Paul!

5194
04:15:45,350 --> 04:15:45,950
Paul!

5195
04:15:47,590 --> 04:15:48,030
Wait!

5196
04:15:49,490 --> 04:15:50,050
That's it?

5197
04:15:50,230 --> 04:15:50,850
Oh my gosh!

5198
04:15:50,970 --> 04:15:51,950
So I don't have to...

5199
04:15:54,450 --> 04:15:54,890
Oh...

5200
04:15:56,550 --> 04:15:56,990
Paul...

5201
04:15:58,630 --> 04:16:00,350
Oh my god!

5202
04:16:01,750 --> 04:16:04,550
So that's probably going to be the big baddie boss, huh?

5203
04:16:05,150 --> 04:16:05,590
Maybe.

5204
04:16:05,710 --> 04:16:06,630
At least one of them.

5205
04:16:07,110 --> 04:16:08,710
We found a note from Edward.

5206
04:16:08,950 --> 04:16:11,630
I was going in so prepared to fight, Subset!

5207
04:16:13,370 --> 04:16:14,270
That's so funny.

5208
04:16:14,670 --> 04:16:15,110
Oh my god!

5209
04:16:15,110 --> 04:16:15,290
Oh my god!

5210
04:16:15,330 --> 04:16:15,470
Oh my god!

5211
04:16:15,970 --> 04:16:17,670
What does our note from Edward say?

5212
04:16:18,890 --> 04:16:24,470
The note reads, My dearest Alex, I'm glad that you have followed my paper trail thus far.

5213
04:16:24,650 --> 04:16:26,270
I knew I could depend on you.

5214
04:16:26,390 --> 04:16:28,470
This will be the hardest part of your journey.

5215
04:16:28,590 --> 04:16:35,550
Look for the 88 keys to continue your journey into the past.

5216
04:16:35,810 --> 04:16:38,370
Your loving grandfather, Edward.

5217
04:16:39,850 --> 04:16:41,910
Are they on like a key ring?

5218
04:16:43,530 --> 04:16:45,030
Are they all...

5219
04:16:45,030 --> 04:16:45,630
Are they...

5220
04:16:45,970 --> 04:16:49,130
Grandpa, you're leaving out some really crucial information here.

5221
04:16:49,250 --> 04:16:50,730
Are they all in one spot?

5222
04:16:51,530 --> 04:16:52,130
Like...

5223
04:16:53,570 --> 04:16:54,910
Grandpa, you're...

5224
04:16:56,990 --> 04:16:59,070
Oh my gosh, my sanity is so low.

5225
04:17:05,590 --> 04:17:07,130
Oh, let me save too.

5226
04:17:12,710 --> 04:17:13,830
Oh, goodbye Paul.

5227
04:17:16,070 --> 04:17:17,270
Alright, um...

5228
04:17:17,270 --> 04:17:19,430
I want to find this.

5229
04:17:21,710 --> 04:17:22,330
Um...

5230
04:17:22,330 --> 04:17:23,410
Wow.

5231
04:17:23,650 --> 04:17:26,050
The way her hips move is so awesome.

5232
04:17:26,510 --> 04:17:28,130
I don't think I ever noticed before.

5233
04:17:30,570 --> 04:17:33,330
Minto's mind was blown when the boss fake out.

5234
04:17:33,470 --> 04:17:35,290
Kind of like Paul's.

5235
04:17:35,950 --> 04:17:39,410
You will find his keys in one piece.

5236
04:17:42,850 --> 04:17:43,470
Oh...

5237
04:17:45,990 --> 04:17:47,050
The keys.

5238
04:17:47,050 --> 04:17:47,570
Geez.

5239
04:17:48,290 --> 04:17:49,670
Are they in this?

5240
04:17:49,770 --> 04:17:50,310
Is it this?

5241
04:17:50,950 --> 04:17:53,830
Okay, what new stuff did we... have we...

5242
04:17:56,250 --> 04:17:58,210
What new spells have we learned?

5243
04:17:59,370 --> 04:18:00,250
Five star.

5244
04:18:03,150 --> 04:18:04,710
Enchant item, recover.

5245
04:18:05,830 --> 04:18:06,570
Reveal invisible.

5246
04:18:07,170 --> 04:18:08,450
Yeah, we got Paragon.

5247
04:18:08,730 --> 04:18:09,730
Summon trapper.

5248
04:18:10,990 --> 04:18:12,630
This one is summon zombie.

5249
04:18:12,990 --> 04:18:14,910
This one is mystery.

5250
04:18:15,030 --> 04:18:16,350
I don't remember what this one is.

5251
04:18:17,050 --> 04:18:17,450
Shield.

5252
04:18:19,230 --> 04:18:19,910
Damage field.

5253
04:18:21,070 --> 04:18:21,630
What do I

5254
04:18:32,410 --> 04:18:33,610
have to do with this thing?

5255
04:18:43,640 --> 04:18:44,600
Nothing moves.

5256
04:18:44,700 --> 04:18:48,420
I think I need that... another piece before I can do this.

5257
04:18:49,380 --> 04:18:49,860
Maybe.

5258
04:18:50,080 --> 04:18:50,660
I can't tell.

5259
04:18:55,300 --> 04:18:56,940
Wasn't there someone else without a head?

5260
04:19:03,600 --> 04:19:05,100
What are these pieces on the ground?

5261
04:19:07,220 --> 04:19:07,880
Pick up?

5262
04:19:08,360 --> 04:19:08,840
Oh!

5263
04:19:09,160 --> 04:19:09,640
Ammunition!

5264
04:19:09,940 --> 04:19:10,360
Uh oh.

5265
04:19:10,480 --> 04:19:12,240
This can't be happening!

5266
04:19:14,120 --> 04:19:16,140
I was gonna say, uh oh.

5267
04:19:16,220 --> 04:19:18,080
If I need ammunition, that means I'm fighting.

5268
04:19:18,420 --> 04:19:19,060
What is this?

5269
04:19:20,500 --> 04:19:21,180
Grandpa!

5270
04:19:24,100 --> 04:19:25,780
Grandpa, quit using the fireplace!

5271
04:19:26,300 --> 04:19:28,480
Grandpa really likes the...

5272
04:19:30,340 --> 04:19:31,600
Oh gosh!

5273
04:19:31,840 --> 04:19:34,640
I got 99 problems and 88 more keys.

5274
04:19:36,520 --> 04:19:39,820
My sanity is still low and I'm getting scary things.

5275
04:19:39,820 --> 04:19:40,740
It's freaking me out.

5276
04:19:42,860 --> 04:19:43,880
88 keys.

5277
04:19:44,940 --> 04:19:45,980
88 keys.

5278
04:19:47,500 --> 04:19:49,320
It's not upstairs or...

5279
04:19:50,780 --> 04:19:51,300
Um...

5280
04:19:59,100 --> 04:19:59,920
Oh my gosh.

5281
04:20:01,640 --> 04:20:02,160
Um...

5282
04:20:02,160 --> 04:20:04,040
Then you have these doors.

5283
04:20:04,160 --> 04:20:05,040
Let's check them out.

5284
04:20:09,880 --> 04:20:10,400
Uh...

5285
04:20:10,400 --> 04:20:12,060
It's been a while since I've looked in here.

5286
04:20:13,240 --> 04:20:13,760
So...

5287
04:20:13,760 --> 04:20:14,180
Okay.

5288
04:20:14,200 --> 04:20:15,620
There was like the phone and everything.

5289
04:20:15,740 --> 04:20:15,960
Okay.

5290
04:20:15,960 --> 04:20:16,060
Yeah.

5291
04:20:18,220 --> 04:20:18,700
Um...

5292
04:20:19,580 --> 04:20:20,700
Here's one key.

5293
04:20:22,380 --> 04:20:22,860
Oh!

5294
04:20:23,840 --> 04:20:24,720
It's too dark.

5295
04:20:24,780 --> 04:20:24,900
Oh!

5296
04:20:24,960 --> 04:20:25,380
The circuit.

5297
04:20:27,660 --> 04:20:28,140
Oh...

5298
04:20:30,980 --> 04:20:31,460
Circuit?

5299
04:20:31,740 --> 04:20:32,540
Where would the circuit be?

5300
04:20:33,640 --> 04:20:34,120
Okay.

5301
04:20:34,120 --> 04:20:35,180
I don't think it's over there.

5302
04:20:35,320 --> 04:20:35,900
We already thought.

5303
04:20:37,800 --> 04:20:38,800
Are there trash?

5304
04:20:39,300 --> 04:20:40,540
Are people trying to spoil?

5305
04:20:41,480 --> 04:20:41,980
It's okay.

5306
04:20:42,060 --> 04:20:43,300
I might ask for a hint later.

5307
04:20:43,700 --> 04:20:44,500
Oh yeah.

5308
04:20:44,560 --> 04:20:45,480
Our sanity is low.

5309
04:20:45,940 --> 04:20:46,420
Okay.

5310
04:20:47,020 --> 04:20:47,500
Okay.

5311
04:20:49,240 --> 04:20:49,680
Oh!

5312
04:20:49,820 --> 04:20:52,840
I remember the sanity of the thing in this one with the bathroom.

5313
04:20:52,980 --> 04:20:53,620
It freaked me out.

5314
04:20:58,020 --> 04:20:58,460
Um...

5315
04:21:02,060 --> 04:21:02,760
You're okay.

5316
04:21:07,270 --> 04:21:08,410
Kind of giving it out.

5317
04:21:08,470 --> 04:21:08,730
What?

5318
04:21:08,830 --> 04:21:09,410
The answer?

5319
04:21:09,550 --> 04:21:10,290
Or the keys?

5320
04:21:10,450 --> 04:21:11,370
Because everyone's giving me...

5321
04:21:11,370 --> 04:21:13,430
I've gotten like three keys now from people in chat.

5322
04:21:15,630 --> 04:21:16,450
We're so close.

5323
04:21:21,270 --> 04:21:21,710
Um...

5324
04:21:21,710 --> 04:21:22,150
Okay.

5325
04:21:22,150 --> 04:21:22,350
Okay.

5326
04:21:22,350 --> 04:21:22,390
Okay.

5327
04:21:24,170 --> 04:21:24,530
What?

5328
04:21:25,010 --> 04:21:25,150
What?

5329
04:21:25,750 --> 04:21:27,330
Do I need to do the circuit downstairs?

5330
04:21:31,310 --> 04:21:34,210
Why do they always knock on the doors that I'm going to?

5331
04:21:35,490 --> 04:21:36,790
I think we should use the...

5332
04:21:38,310 --> 04:21:39,050
What's that sound?

5333
04:21:42,860 --> 04:21:44,360
You guys are blocking it but...

5334
04:21:44,360 --> 04:21:45,360
Do you see him in the corner?

5335
04:21:47,320 --> 04:21:48,220
Oh my god!

5336
04:21:48,240 --> 04:21:49,200
That scared the hell out of me.

5337
04:21:50,500 --> 04:21:51,120
Oh my god!

5338
04:21:51,200 --> 04:21:51,660
Oh my god!

5339
04:21:51,680 --> 04:21:51,880
Oh my god!

5340
04:21:51,880 --> 04:21:52,300
Oh my god!

5341
04:21:52,340 --> 04:21:52,680
Ah!

5342
04:21:57,260 --> 04:21:57,980
The darkness.

5343
04:21:58,120 --> 04:21:58,140
He's here.

5344
04:22:01,720 --> 04:22:03,180
That scared me.

5345
04:22:04,560 --> 04:22:07,480
Look at her just looking up like, that was weird.

5346
04:22:18,120 --> 04:22:19,240
Oh yeah,

5347
04:22:24,240 --> 04:22:25,340
because he played the organ.

5348
04:22:25,580 --> 04:22:27,340
Her hands are drawn to the keys.

5349
04:22:27,340 --> 04:22:29,660
Oh, almost of their own accord.

5350
04:22:29,900 --> 04:22:31,420
Should Alex play the piano?

5351
04:22:34,160 --> 04:22:35,740
We're playing the...

5352
04:22:36,340 --> 04:22:37,520
the same song!

5353
04:22:39,880 --> 04:22:40,560
Was

5354
04:22:50,560 --> 04:22:51,600
that a monkey?

5355
04:22:53,720 --> 04:22:54,840
Piano keys!

5356
04:22:55,140 --> 04:22:56,580
I should have played...

5357
04:22:57,880 --> 04:23:01,000
I should have played Undertale.

5358
04:23:01,100 --> 04:23:02,420
Sans Undertale instead.

5359
04:23:03,480 --> 04:23:04,500
Chapter page!

5360
04:23:05,420 --> 04:23:07,280
Alex has found a chapter page entitled...

5361
04:23:07,340 --> 04:23:08,860
The Forbidden City!

5362
04:23:11,520 --> 04:23:12,240
Oh,

5363
04:23:17,820 --> 04:23:18,640
we're back!

5364
04:23:18,780 --> 04:23:19,460
Oh my gosh.

5365
04:23:23,140 --> 04:23:25,000
Who are you?

5366
04:23:26,060 --> 04:23:28,440
I am your lord and conqueror.

5367
04:23:28,840 --> 04:23:32,580
What manner of forsaken being are you?

5368
04:23:33,420 --> 04:23:34,140
So...

5369
04:23:34,760 --> 04:23:36,880
you can see me in my true form.

5370
04:23:37,220 --> 04:23:40,880
You are a gifted man.

5371
04:23:41,300 --> 04:23:42,620
Take this one...

5372
04:23:42,620 --> 04:23:44,620
and use him as the foundation for the pillar.

5373
04:23:45,620 --> 04:23:46,780
He is special.

5374
04:23:47,360 --> 04:23:48,300
He is special?

5375
04:23:48,460 --> 04:23:49,760
And you will be given a special place...

5376
04:23:49,760 --> 04:23:50,900
among the suffering.

5377
04:23:52,900 --> 04:23:53,540
Okay.

5378
04:24:00,080 --> 04:24:00,940
Not the pillar.

5379
04:24:02,080 --> 04:24:03,960
Oh god, right, the pillar.

5380
04:24:04,860 --> 04:24:05,740
Uh-oh.

5381
04:24:06,380 --> 04:24:08,000
Is next chapter...

5382
04:24:08,000 --> 04:24:09,220
kind of special?

5383
04:24:11,520 --> 04:24:14,100
Is next chapter something...

5384
04:24:14,100 --> 04:24:15,800
I should be really looking forward to?

5385
04:24:15,800 --> 04:24:17,140
No, no, no.

5386
04:24:17,280 --> 04:24:18,220
No, no, no.

5387
04:24:18,280 --> 04:24:18,920
No, no, no.

5388
04:24:20,460 --> 04:24:23,650
No, no, no.

5389
04:24:23,650 --> 04:24:24,290
The pillar.

5390
04:24:26,550 --> 04:24:27,850
It's gonna be pillar man.

5391
04:24:30,390 --> 04:24:31,110
It's great.

5392
04:24:31,230 --> 04:24:31,630
IMO?

5393
04:24:31,730 --> 04:24:32,030
Okay.

5394
04:24:32,210 --> 04:24:33,030
I'll believe you.

5395
04:24:33,330 --> 04:24:35,630
But I will save that for...

5396
04:24:36,730 --> 04:24:37,210
next...

5397
04:24:37,810 --> 04:24:38,050
week!

5398
04:24:44,750 --> 04:24:45,770
I'm so sorry.

5399
04:24:45,850 --> 04:24:47,450
I was so sleepy today, you guys.

5400
04:24:47,530 --> 04:24:48,010
I was so sleepy.

5401
04:24:48,010 --> 04:24:50,970
How many... Wait, so that was... Oh, we got through two chapters.

5402
04:24:51,950 --> 04:24:52,670
No, sorry.

5403
04:24:53,490 --> 04:24:53,970
Yes.

5404
04:24:54,350 --> 04:24:55,150
Two chapters.

5405
04:24:56,570 --> 04:24:57,590
We... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5406
04:24:57,630 --> 04:24:58,350
We got through two chapters.

5407
04:24:59,370 --> 04:25:02,830
So, how many more is that after?

5408
04:25:02,890 --> 04:25:05,130
Like three or four chapters?

5409
04:25:05,290 --> 04:25:06,830
Next chapter is kind of slow and tedious.

5410
04:25:07,390 --> 04:25:07,870
Okay.

5411
04:25:09,690 --> 04:25:10,710
I'll do my best.

5412
04:25:11,170 --> 04:25:17,010
Maybe we'll see Mint use the Icemon key in the next Blued stream.

5413
04:25:18,170 --> 04:25:20,110
The Icemon... Icemon key.

5414
04:25:21,850 --> 04:25:22,870
Three left, I think.

5415
04:25:23,050 --> 04:25:24,550
I can't... I'll have to check.

5416
04:25:28,380 --> 04:25:29,340
Thanks, Dry Princess!

5417
04:25:30,020 --> 04:25:32,100
Great job getting past two long chapters.

5418
04:25:32,200 --> 04:25:32,880
Have a great rest.

5419
04:25:32,920 --> 04:25:33,660
Paragon, paragon.

5420
04:25:34,080 --> 04:25:35,640
You'll probably finish next stream.

5421
04:25:35,660 --> 04:25:36,000
Don't worry.

5422
04:25:36,320 --> 04:25:37,160
Yeah, we'll see.

5423
04:25:37,260 --> 04:25:37,580
We'll see.

5424
04:25:40,240 --> 04:25:40,700
Five.

5425
04:25:41,260 --> 04:25:42,600
Wait, I think...

5426
04:25:43,190 --> 04:25:45,180
I can't remember how many chapters I'm on.

5427
04:25:45,280 --> 04:25:45,840
I wish I would...

5428
04:25:45,840 --> 04:25:47,440
Wait, does it say in the menu?

5429
04:25:49,860 --> 04:25:51,220
Ooh, who's running around?

5430
04:25:53,160 --> 04:25:54,120
Kind of freaky.

5431
04:25:54,400 --> 04:25:55,420
Oh, that's a lamp.

5432
04:25:55,580 --> 04:25:56,040
Never mind.

5433
04:25:58,220 --> 04:25:59,960
Just says chapter page.

5434
04:26:00,260 --> 04:26:00,540
Check.

5435
04:26:01,400 --> 04:26:03,740
Just says chapter... Yeah.

5436
04:26:04,720 --> 04:26:05,420
Doesn't say.

5437
04:26:05,560 --> 04:26:07,940
Thanks for being... Thanks for the awesome stream.

5438
04:26:08,380 --> 04:26:10,560
Mint, been great watching you play this.

5439
04:26:10,620 --> 04:26:11,140
Thank you!

5440
04:26:11,320 --> 04:26:12,680
I'm having so much fun.

5441
04:26:12,780 --> 04:26:12,960
This...

5442
04:26:12,960 --> 04:26:15,020
This story is so fascinating.

5443
04:26:15,160 --> 04:26:16,620
The gameplay is so...

5444
04:26:17,200 --> 04:26:17,880
Oh my gosh.

5445
04:26:17,920 --> 04:26:18,860
Oh, the sanity effects?

5446
04:26:19,860 --> 04:26:20,980
Get me every time still.

5447
04:26:21,200 --> 04:26:22,820
Like, most of them at least.

5448
04:26:22,880 --> 04:26:23,500
They're so crazy.

5449
04:26:26,080 --> 04:26:27,540
Like the... What was the one?

5450
04:26:29,780 --> 04:26:30,180
The...

5451
04:26:31,700 --> 04:26:33,340
There was one that really got me.

5452
04:26:33,340 --> 04:26:34,880
I can't remember earlier, but yeah.

5453
04:26:35,460 --> 04:26:36,280
Thank you for the stream.

5454
04:26:36,320 --> 04:26:37,520
I had a blast watching you live tonight.

5455
04:26:37,720 --> 04:26:38,540
Rest well and see you soon.

5456
04:26:38,660 --> 04:26:39,300
Thank you, Tanuki!

5457
04:26:41,820 --> 04:26:43,440
You still haven't seen the worst one?

5458
04:26:46,400 --> 04:26:47,760
The blue screen was great.

5459
04:26:47,840 --> 04:26:49,140
The blue screen was really funny.

5460
04:26:49,860 --> 04:26:53,660
Especially because I'm playing it on my computer.

5461
04:26:53,800 --> 04:26:56,940
So feels more like I'm actually getting a blue screen.

5462
04:26:57,320 --> 04:26:58,420
The flies?

5463
04:26:58,620 --> 04:27:00,860
The flies that were on my computer screen?

5464
04:27:01,260 --> 04:27:02,340
were really cool.

5465
04:27:04,140 --> 04:27:07,400
Yeah, I'm going to try and keep my sanity lower.

5466
04:27:09,120 --> 04:27:12,900
So that I can, like, experience more freaky things.

5467
04:27:14,080 --> 04:27:16,820
And if not, maybe I'll like... look up a...

5468
04:27:17,640 --> 04:27:18,660
Eternal dark...

5469
04:27:18,660 --> 04:27:19,560
Like once I'm done with the game.

5470
04:27:19,560 --> 04:27:24,980
I'll look up an Eternal Darkness Sanity Effects video, if one of those exists.

5471
04:27:31,500 --> 04:27:34,820
I was like, what is making all that noise?

5472
04:27:35,080 --> 04:27:37,820
It's the page, it's the chapter, it's so noisy.

5473
04:27:38,280 --> 04:27:39,460
Thanks for the early stream today!

5474
04:27:39,680 --> 04:27:41,080
Any stream plans for tomorrow?

5475
04:27:41,240 --> 04:27:41,480
Oh yes!

5476
04:27:42,240 --> 04:27:43,880
I do have stream plans for tomorrow.

5477
04:27:44,420 --> 04:27:48,380
I believe I'm streaming all this coming week, every day.

5478
04:27:50,760 --> 04:27:53,200
And so, I will...

5479
04:27:54,020 --> 04:27:55,420
Sorry, I'm checking my phone real quick.

5480
04:27:55,680 --> 04:28:00,620
I will have a schedule up tonight, hopefully.

5481
04:28:00,740 --> 04:28:01,820
As long as I don't fall asleep.

5482
04:28:01,960 --> 04:28:03,640
And if not, I'll have it up tomorrow morning.

5483
04:28:07,220 --> 04:28:08,440
You must have missed it.

5484
04:28:08,480 --> 04:28:10,120
Was afraid to ask if this was the demo.

5485
04:28:10,820 --> 04:28:11,480
Demo of the game?

5486
04:28:13,040 --> 04:28:13,540
No, no.

5487
04:28:13,580 --> 04:28:15,760
I'm quite far into the game, I think.

5488
04:28:19,940 --> 04:28:23,660
But yeah, I want to finish this up before I go to Japan.

5489
04:28:23,840 --> 04:28:25,560
So hopefully, you know, next week.

5490
04:28:27,300 --> 04:28:28,720
Hopefully in one more stream.

5491
04:28:29,100 --> 04:28:31,560
If you guys think maybe one more stream.

5492
04:28:31,660 --> 04:28:32,980
If not, we'll see.

5493
04:28:35,740 --> 04:28:37,420
Every day, hopefully you don't get burnt out.

5494
04:28:37,560 --> 04:28:39,180
No, no, I feel good.

5495
04:28:40,660 --> 04:28:47,600
And because I'm going to Japan next week too, I want to make sure I stream every day since I'll be gone for a couple of days.

5496
04:28:50,160 --> 04:28:50,780
Yeah, yeah.

5497
04:28:52,520 --> 04:28:56,400
No, next weekend more Eternal Darkness and Metal Gear Solid 3.

5498
04:28:56,540 --> 04:28:58,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5499
04:28:58,600 --> 04:29:03,620
I got to play as much of Metal Gear Solid 3 before TGS.

5500
04:29:04,580 --> 04:29:08,720
So I can have a very good impression of like, Oh, this was different.

5501
04:29:08,900 --> 04:29:09,820
This was the same.

5502
04:29:09,920 --> 04:29:10,880
This felt different.

5503
04:29:11,020 --> 04:29:11,840
This was different.

5504
04:29:11,960 --> 04:29:12,840
This was the same.

5505
04:29:12,900 --> 04:29:15,260
You know, I have to give a very accurate report.

5506
04:29:16,080 --> 04:29:17,300
My book report.

5507
04:29:18,500 --> 04:29:19,600
My game report.

5508
04:29:20,180 --> 04:29:22,300
But I have some other stuff.

5509
04:29:22,480 --> 04:29:24,780
I have fun stuff.

5510
04:29:24,920 --> 04:29:28,180
I am, I think, in a collab this coming week as well.

5511
04:29:28,200 --> 04:29:29,040
I believe on Tuesday.

5512
04:29:33,080 --> 04:29:35,540
With a bunch of people.

5513
04:29:36,120 --> 04:29:38,140
Some people that I've never collabed with before.

5514
04:29:38,540 --> 04:29:39,980
So I'm excited about that.

5515
04:29:41,300 --> 04:29:41,820
And...

5516
04:29:43,400 --> 04:29:44,660
So I'm in a collab.

5517
04:29:45,800 --> 04:29:47,260
Doing Pico Park 2.

5518
04:29:50,320 --> 04:29:56,380
And I have been putting together some other fun collab stuff.

5519
04:29:56,500 --> 04:29:58,240
For once I'm back as well.

5520
04:29:59,580 --> 04:30:01,660
So... and then of course my birthday.

5521
04:30:03,000 --> 04:30:04,280
And... yeah.

5522
04:30:05,300 --> 04:30:06,020
My birthday.

5523
04:30:06,200 --> 04:30:08,980
I have an announcement on my birthday.

5524
04:30:09,420 --> 04:30:12,980
So I think you guys might want to come.

5525
04:30:13,200 --> 04:30:17,200
If you hadn't already thought about it.

5526
04:30:17,200 --> 04:30:18,440
But it's also going to be a fun stream.

5527
04:30:18,560 --> 04:30:18,840
I think.

5528
04:30:18,860 --> 04:30:20,700
Because I'm cooking a little bit.

5529
04:30:22,300 --> 04:30:23,180
And... yeah.

5530
04:30:25,380 --> 04:30:26,980
And I'm very excited.

5531
04:30:27,620 --> 04:30:28,060
Yeah.

5532
04:30:30,140 --> 04:30:31,280
Leafly October 5th.

5533
04:30:31,380 --> 04:30:31,680
I know.

5534
04:30:31,800 --> 04:30:33,040
There's so much going on.

5535
04:30:33,880 --> 04:30:34,900
So much happening.

5536
04:30:35,040 --> 04:30:35,580
So much happening.

5537
04:30:40,040 --> 04:30:40,480
So...

5538
04:30:41,700 --> 04:30:42,560
I know.

5539
04:30:42,620 --> 04:30:45,780
I think part of the reason why I haven't been sleeping very well is...

5540
04:30:45,780 --> 04:30:47,200
I'll like go to take a nap.

5541
04:30:47,320 --> 04:30:48,260
And then my mind will...

5542
04:30:48,260 --> 04:30:49,540
You know like when you take a shower.

5543
04:30:49,640 --> 04:30:51,880
And you get like all your good ideas in the shower.

5544
04:30:52,060 --> 04:30:53,160
It's kind of like that for me.

5545
04:30:53,380 --> 04:30:54,680
But I'm like about to fall asleep.

5546
04:30:54,840 --> 04:30:55,500
And I'm like oh my god.

5547
04:30:55,820 --> 04:30:56,720
I just had an idea.

5548
04:30:56,880 --> 04:30:58,740
And I like have to get on my phone and write it down.

5549
04:30:59,460 --> 04:30:59,780
So...

5550
04:31:00,800 --> 04:31:04,520
To me my mind has just been racing and racing and racing at what...

5551
04:31:06,020 --> 04:31:07,280
At what all I can do.

5552
04:31:07,460 --> 04:31:09,720
And stuff that I've been trying to plan.

5553
04:31:09,860 --> 04:31:11,040
And hopefully it all works out.

5554
04:31:11,080 --> 04:31:12,040
And it all works good.

5555
04:31:12,440 --> 04:31:12,760
But...

5556
04:31:14,420 --> 04:31:14,740
Yeah.

5557
04:31:14,740 --> 04:31:14,960
Hopefully.

5558
04:31:15,460 --> 04:31:16,000
Hopefully.

5559
04:31:17,700 --> 04:31:19,700
It's a bit of a lot.

5560
04:31:19,760 --> 04:31:22,600
As in my one man army.

5561
04:31:23,760 --> 04:31:24,440
But...

5562
04:31:25,540 --> 04:31:26,360
I'm excited.

5563
04:31:26,500 --> 04:31:27,520
I'm excited to finish this game.

5564
04:31:27,700 --> 04:31:28,640
Excited for...

5565
04:31:29,420 --> 04:31:30,240
Hold on.

5566
04:31:36,460 --> 04:31:37,140
Sorry.

5567
04:31:40,860 --> 04:31:41,540
Sorry.

5568
04:31:47,880 --> 04:31:49,680
I just sneezed too.

5569
04:31:49,880 --> 04:31:50,320
Stop.

5570
04:31:51,060 --> 04:31:52,200
You are Minto.

5571
04:31:55,740 --> 04:31:56,300
Sorry.

5572
04:31:57,180 --> 04:31:58,660
I sneezed like an old man.

5573
04:32:00,420 --> 04:32:02,520
I don't have like a cute sneeze.

5574
04:32:02,820 --> 04:32:04,180
I sneeze like an old man.

5575
04:32:04,380 --> 04:32:04,780
I'm like...

5576
04:32:09,240 --> 04:32:09,800
Yeah.

5577
04:32:12,580 --> 04:32:13,140
So...

5578
04:32:14,820 --> 04:32:15,380
Okay.

5579
04:32:15,860 --> 04:32:17,620
Thank you guys for hanging out with me.

5580
04:32:17,620 --> 04:32:17,860
Thank you guys for hanging out with me today.

5581
04:32:18,440 --> 04:32:18,840
And...

5582
04:32:18,840 --> 04:32:21,000
I'm so glad that we can play more Eternal Darkness.

5583
04:32:21,140 --> 04:32:21,880
Again, I'm so sorry.

5584
04:32:21,940 --> 04:32:23,200
It took me so long to get back to this.

5585
04:32:23,880 --> 04:32:24,280
But...

5586
04:32:24,280 --> 04:32:25,820
I'm glad to be back in.

5587
04:32:25,880 --> 04:32:26,480
I'm really...

5588
04:32:26,480 --> 04:32:26,860
I...

5589
04:32:27,540 --> 04:32:28,340
You know...

5590
04:32:28,340 --> 04:32:32,960
The first time I was like so confused that I was like what's going on to be kind of invested.

5591
04:32:33,140 --> 04:32:34,420
But now I'm like really...

5592
04:32:34,420 --> 04:32:35,520
I feel really, really in.

5593
04:32:35,640 --> 04:32:36,320
So I'm like...

5594
04:32:36,320 --> 04:32:36,880
Okay.

5595
04:32:36,980 --> 04:32:37,380
I'm...

5596
04:32:38,480 --> 04:32:40,500
Excited to see how the ending is.

5597
04:32:40,520 --> 04:32:41,280
How this turns out.

5598
04:32:41,420 --> 04:32:41,820
How...

5599
04:32:42,660 --> 04:32:44,100
We escape the darkness.

5600
04:32:46,100 --> 04:32:47,600
And how we make it non-existent.

5601
04:32:47,600 --> 04:32:47,860
Not eternal.

5602
04:32:48,600 --> 04:32:49,120
Only...

5603
04:32:49,120 --> 04:32:49,840
Like...

5604
04:32:49,840 --> 04:32:51,020
Maybe like a...

5605
04:32:51,020 --> 04:32:52,140
Bi-annual darkness.

5606
04:32:52,460 --> 04:32:52,720
You know?

5607
04:32:55,520 --> 04:32:59,120
You're an old man for other reasons but you sneeze like a pure maiden.

5608
04:33:04,100 --> 04:33:04,620
Huh?

5609
04:33:08,260 --> 04:33:09,280
What other ways?

5610
04:33:09,360 --> 04:33:09,900
I'm Oji-san.

5611
04:33:10,080 --> 04:33:10,860
I'm just like...

5612
04:33:10,860 --> 04:33:11,800
You know...

5613
04:33:11,800 --> 04:33:12,400
I really...

5614
04:33:12,400 --> 04:33:13,260
I really...

5615
04:33:15,000 --> 04:33:18,780
Connect with Hoshino from Blue Archive when she called herself Oji-san.

5616
04:33:18,900 --> 04:33:19,440
And I'm just like...

5617
04:33:19,440 --> 04:33:19,640
Yeah.

5618
04:33:20,060 --> 04:33:20,580
And...

5619
04:33:20,600 --> 04:33:21,140
Yeah, me too.

5620
04:33:22,960 --> 04:33:23,480
Okay!

5621
04:33:25,220 --> 04:33:26,560
Thank you guys...

5622
04:33:26,560 --> 04:33:28,060
For hanging out.

5623
04:33:28,240 --> 04:33:29,500
I will see you guys...

5624
04:33:29,500 --> 04:33:30,080
Tomorrow.

5625
04:33:30,400 --> 04:33:32,820
And if I don't see you tomorrow, I'll see you whenever I can see you.

5626
04:33:33,500 --> 04:33:34,020
And...

5627
04:33:34,020 --> 04:33:35,660
Thank you guys so much.

5628
04:33:36,040 --> 04:33:36,560
And...

5629
04:33:36,560 --> 04:33:36,940
Paragon!

5630
04:33:37,080 --> 04:33:37,500
Paragon!

5631
04:33:37,700 --> 04:33:38,120
Paragon!

5632
04:33:38,120 --> 04:33:38,500
Paragon!

5633
04:33:38,620 --> 04:33:39,040
Paragon!

5634
04:33:41,680 --> 04:33:43,060
Aso-minto-gon!

5635
04:33:43,320 --> 04:33:44,060
Aso-minto!

5636
04:33:44,560 --> 04:33:45,320
Bye-bye!

5637
04:33:45,460 --> 04:33:46,320
Thank you!

5638
04:33:47,000 --> 04:33:47,540
Thank you!

5639
04:33:47,560 --> 04:33:47,840
Thank you!

5640
04:33:47,960 --> 04:33:48,640
Bye-bye!

5641
04:33:48,780 --> 04:33:49,180
Bye-bye!

5642
04:33:49,220 --> 04:33:49,480

5643
04:33:49,480 --> 04:33:49,640
