00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:41,150
Welcome back to Outer Wilds Echoes of the Eye!

2
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,450
The Eye!

3
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,660
Oh my goodness.

4
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,300
Time to get comfy and lurk in this lovely stream.

5
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,040
Hi Mint, hello!

6
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,880
Parasocial.

7
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,920
Yeah, how else to ghost?

8
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,700
Thanks.

9
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,420
Yeah, welcome back to Outer Wilds Echoes of the Eye.

10
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,420
Not just a single echo, multiple echoes.

11
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,980
I'm a little scatterbrained because I had so much going on today.

12
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,360
But I'm excited to continue this.

13
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,320
This is part two out of probably three.

14
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,400
I think today will be a little bit shorter of a stream because...

15
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,480
I've talked a lot today actually.

16
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,440
So...

17
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,840
Even before this, my throat was feeling a little...

18
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,580
A little...

19
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,260
Not hurty.

20
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,100
A little sore.

21
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,040
So...

22
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,000
Will it be uploaded to YouTube?

23
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,580
The stream?

24
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,720
The stream?

25
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,420
The stream?

26
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,300
Vocal cords a little strained?

27
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:14,800
Yes.

28
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,560
You could say a little strained, a little parasite-y.

29
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,800
Vocal parasites.

30
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,260
But um...

31
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,580
I'm thinking maybe like three hours.

32
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,240
And then we'll finish it up next week.

33
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,080
In a part three.

34
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,820
YouTube content on YouTube?

35
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,880
Of course not!

36
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,800
Did you find the egg?

37
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,940
The egg.

38
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
You guys, the egg that...

39
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,000
Yesterday I thought I saw an egg.

40
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,620
The egg of the universe.

41
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,660
Might be four streams?

42
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,940
No, I think I'm gonna endurance it next week.

43
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,040
Yeah.

44
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,880
I'm gonna endurance it.

45
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,960
So, don't worry about it.

46
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,200
Um, the egg...

47
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,260
Was an egg!

48
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,820
It was a real egg.

49
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,720
It existed.

50
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,280
It was on the screen.

51
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,000
It was a real egg.

52
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,940
It was an egg!

53
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,420
It was an egg!

54
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,180
It's gonna be really endurance-y though.

55
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,640
We'll see!

56
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
I looked it up!

57
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,740
Why did...

58
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,460
Oh my goodness.

59
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,400
My chair.

60
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,320
Why did it say that the DLC is like 10 hours then?

61
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,840
Everyone's making it seem like it's a 50 hour DLC.

62
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,160
Everyone's making it seem like it's a 50 hour DLC.

63
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,020
Echoes of the eyes.

64
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's resume our expedition.

65
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,760
Depends on the person.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,100
Smart!

67
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,640
Right!

68
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,620
Oh, let's wake up.

69
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,880
Good morning!

70
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,540
So, I'm trying to think...

71
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,740
There was one place in particular from yesterday that I really want to go to today.

72
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,180
It's the one location that I keep missing.

73
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,400
Hold on.

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,080
Oh!

75
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,600
Let's view the ship logs a little bit first.

76
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,900
As a recap.

77
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,660
The Stranger.

78
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,980
We found the Stranger!

79
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,640
It's an artificial ring world hidden within some sort of cloaking field.

80
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,020
Real...

81
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,380
Mint words.

82
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,400
Not Wikipedia copy-pasted.

83
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,160
It is not Hearthian or Gnomian.

84
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,200
Yeah.

85
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,440
And...

86
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,020
We made a very large deal.

87
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:57,980
Jeffrey!

88
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,120
That's okay.

89
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,560
It's worth...

90
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
My money's worth, right?

91
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,840
We went to the radio tower to find it.

92
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,460
Was it the reservoir?

93
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:07,900
Oh!

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,420
Look at this.

95
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,820
An enormous reservoir with wooden piers and buildings on both shores.

96
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:19,240
I found a room with a burned control interface and a projection that seems to indicate a broken connection between the Stranger and another craft.

97
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,600
I found a projection showing the Stranger's current trajectory and the Sun's predicted supernova radius.

98
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,800
That's right!

99
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,560
It was moving away from the Sun!

100
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,320
I saw a building marked with a unique symbol.

101
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,000
I think this is the one that I wanted to go to.

102
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,240
Recessed into one of the canyon walls, but the bridge that used to lead to it has rotted away.

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,440
Oh.

104
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,700
I found several ornate metal artifacts inside a workshop surrounded by ghost objects.

105
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:49,700
Yes!

106
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,160
We went in there!

107
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,460
Okay.

108
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,880
But this cliffside building is what is...

109
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,320
There's more to explore here in the reservoir.

110
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,740
Oh.

111
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,860
Well that's just like...

112
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,360
Yeah.

113
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,260
Yeah.

114
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,520
What's...

115
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,440
Oh no.

116
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,220
That's all the old stuff.

117
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,540
Okay.

118
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,580
But no egg to... There was an egg!

119
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,620
They just haven't said it yet.

120
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,240
Uh.

121
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:15,780
Map?

122
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,520
...

123
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,620
Where are you?

124
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,620
This isn't it.

125
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,760
Uh.

126
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,280
Hold on.

127
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,660
Uh.

128
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,620
View the log again.

129
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,360
There we go.

130
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,080
Mark it on...

131
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,300
Okay.

132
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,720
There we go.

133
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,900
Have fun playing!

134
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,540
It's my birthday today!

135
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,340
Mr. Albusy!

136
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,960
Happy birthday!

137
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,140
Happy birthday to you!

138
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,900
Happy birthday to you!

139
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,920
Happy...

140
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,540
Why isn't it letting me autopilot?

141
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,700
Happy birthday Mr. Albusy!

142
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,160
Happy birthday to you!

143
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,220
Oh cause I'm not locked on it.

144
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,460
Oh.

145
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,260
Here I come!

146
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,140
I'm coming in hot!

147
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,880
Stranger!

148
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,560
Hello?

149
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,640
Um.

150
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,600
Can you stop moving for like two seconds?

151
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:29,920
Uh.

152
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,230
Oh.

153
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:35,590
Nope.

154
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,070
That's up.

155
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:36,790
I need to go up.

156
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,490
I need to go up.

157
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,350
I'm matching the velocity!

158
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,450
I'm matching the velocity!

159
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,450
And we also found some secret... Oh wait.

160
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,050
Am I upside down?

161
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:46,710
Again?

162
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,330
How does this keep happening to me?

163
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,270
Just roll.

164
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,810
Perfect landing!

165
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,550
We found some secret ways to get in.

166
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,610
I wonder if there's any other secret ways then, you know?

167
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,450
No?

168
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:06,930
Okay.

169
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,230
It's actually a great landing.

170
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,430
I know!

171
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,130
That's what I'm saying!

172
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,930
I always land perfectly.

173
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,270
On two feet.

174
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:16,930
I'm like a cat.

175
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,390
I can't see anything!

176
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,630
Oh my goodness.

177
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,770
Okay.

178
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,170
Turns out indeed does show during intended directvp.

179
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,050
Oh!

180
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,690
It is!

181
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,010
Oh!

182
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,610
We missed it!

183
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,230
Thanks for the info though, Nan.

184
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,610
Thank you.

185
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,750
What?

186
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,850
Stop!

187
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:41,830
Stop!

188
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:42,930
Stop!

189
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:43,970
Stop!

190
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:44,130
Stop!

191
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,050
Oh!

192
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,890
Oh, we're here!

193
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,690
Oh, we went inside this one!

194
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,690
I didn't even realize.

195
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,370
Okay.

196
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,050
Um...

197
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,690
Let's rotate this.

198
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,010
Alrighty.

199
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,870
On the road again.

200
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,690
Sorry about the lock on...

201
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:05,890
No!

202
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,490
It wasn't you!

203
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:06,910
It was me!

204
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,410
It was me!

205
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,950
It was me!

206
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:09,330
It was me!

207
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,710
It was me!

208
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,230
Jeffrey, don't apologize.

209
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,750
You have nothing to apologize for, buddy.

210
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,410
Look!

211
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,630
This one is not the one that I wanted to go to.

212
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,430
I believe.

213
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,410
This one...

214
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,150
No.

215
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,410
I think it's further up the road.

216
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,370
Woo!

217
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,790
Makes my stomach drop a little bit.

218
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:38,990
My stummy.

219
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,950
Yeah.

220
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,750
I've been around here for quite a bit.

221
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:44,990
Oh!

222
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:47,870
Oh!

223
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:49,750
Wee!

224
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,270
This part is so fun.

225
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:52,670
Okay.

226
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,550
It's past here too.

227
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,050
I love the music here.

228
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,190
I also...

229
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,330
I've noticed that there's like a back side to this.

230
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,530
A behind.

231
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,510
Tower's got a big ol' behind.

232
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,970
No.

233
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:11,350
Oh!

234
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,490
Be careful!

235
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:12,890
Be careful!

236
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,890
We gotta hurry before everything starts breaking apart.

237
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:19,690
Here!

238
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,110
There!

239
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,770
That's the one!

240
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,250
That's the one!

241
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,710
That's the one, right?

242
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,810
I believe.

243
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,030
Oh god!

244
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,630
Oh god!

245
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,000
Maybe not this one.

246
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,260
Actually, maybe I'm a liar.

247
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,720
I'm a liar.

248
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,820
But there is that up there!

249
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,380
Wait a second.

250
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,120
Oh!

251
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,420
Yes!

252
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:43,700
No!

253
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,280
This is the one!

254
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,780
This is the one!

255
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,640
I'm not a liar.

256
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,000
I've never lied.

257
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,460
I've never lied!

258
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,480
But the gap...

259
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,560
That's right.

260
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,800
There's a big ol' gap.

261
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,660
What if we...

262
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:16,840
Ouch!

263
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,100
We're fine!

264
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,240
I thought it was Minecraft rules.

265
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,040
But if I land in the water, I'll be okay.

266
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,320
Come on!

267
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,720
Move!

268
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,800
Maybe I can propel myself up here.

269
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,620
A little bit.

270
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,280
Okay.

271
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:43,820
Nice.

272
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,040
And whoop!

273
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,000
Nice!

274
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,700
Whoop!

275
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,600
Nice!

276
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,080
Whoop!

277
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,860
Vitals are low, but does it really matter Who needs bones?

278
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,240
Not me.

279
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,860
I'm a ghost.

280
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,240
Um...

281
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,380
Hmm...

282
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,040
Hmm...

283
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,500
Whoop!

284
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,690
Uh-oh.

285
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,290
Guys...

286
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,090
Guys...

287
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,010
Uh-oh.

288
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,250
Oh, like there's a way up here.

289
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,210
I heard it though.

290
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,370
I hear that.

291
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,360
Where is that coming from?

292
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,360
Hmm... I guess we'll continue onward.

293
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,700
Push!

294
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,660
Push!

295
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,260
Push!

296
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,720
Come!

297
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,320
Come!

298
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:56,520
Come!

299
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,840
Hmm... This game is scary.

300
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,100
Hahaha!

301
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,020
It's a little eerie, right?

302
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:06,860
Wowee!

303
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,380
I mean, we...

304
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,760
We saw some pretty freaky stuff before.

305
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,220
Oh, I thought that was a door right there.

306
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,220
Um...

307
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,500
Could there be another way?

308
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,540
What's over here actually?

309
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,140
Because...

310
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,640
I think there's only one way to get through here, right?

311
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,140
Like, where does this lead to?

312
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,080
Where am I crazy?

313
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,380
Go!

314
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:37,820
Go!

315
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,160
Go!

316
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,040
Power through!

317
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,440
Power!

318
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:42,880
Power!

319
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,200
Power!

320
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,040
Oh...

321
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,380
It's not strong enough.

322
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,720
Hmm...

323
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,180
But how do we get over through there?

324
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,320
Right?

325
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,640
That might be our way.

326
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,280
What's over here?

327
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,500
Hmm...

328
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,100
You might be crazy.

329
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,060
Hahaha!

330
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,220
I might be crazy.

331
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,310
So that's...

332
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,190
Cause...

333
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,340
Oh, I see it right there.

334
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,260
We have to go on this side and then very quickly go through here.

335
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,380
Because there's all this stuff...

336
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,340
I don't think I've been to those, right?

337
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,080
Those buildings over there.

338
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,560
Hmm...

339
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,160
I don't think so.

340
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,340
What if I just...

341
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,340
Hahaha!

342
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,900
Where does it land?

343
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,810
Is it in the water?

344
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,050
I think it's in the water.

345
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,010
Ha!

346
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,110
Oh!

347
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,580
Nice!

348
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,140
Hahaha!

349
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,660
I can't tell at all if I've been here or not.

350
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,320
Hahaha!

351
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,860
I can't tell even a little bit.

352
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,240
Aww...

353
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,880
This might have been a waste of a run.

354
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,180
But maybe not a total...

355
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,420
Maybe not a waste is dramatic to say, right?

356
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,520
Maybe...

357
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,880
Cause we learned...

358
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,200
Well, nothing.

359
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,260
Hahaha!

360
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,340
I learned that I will try to get to these buildings there.

361
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,180
Can I climb through the trees like a monkey?

362
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,260
Speaking of monkeys...

363
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,780
You guys...

364
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,040
Uh oh.

365
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,660
I'm gonna die.

366
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,260
Oh!

367
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,240
I lived!

368
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,060
Speaking of monkeys...

369
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,940
I have a new high score in Bloons.

370
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,720
Which is like...

371
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,700
A hundred and...

372
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,600
Eighty something.

373
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,540
Hahaha!

374
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,880
No monkey!

375
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,540
No monkey!

376
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,120
No monkey!

377
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,980
I think I'm gonna meditate.

378
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,680
Thank you for always being yourself, Mint.

379
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,820
Is that a good thing?

380
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,920
Thanks, Dylan.

381
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,780
Mm-hmm.

382
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,080
Actually, no.

383
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,700
I think I lied.

384
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,280
I think not 180.

385
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
I think it was 178.

386
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,960
I think it was 178.

387
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,000
But that's also closer.

388
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,420
To... 200.

389
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,200
She lied?

390
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,160
I don't lie!

391
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,100
I don't lie!

392
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,400
I've never lied.

393
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:38,980
I've never lied.

394
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,240
I've never lied.

395
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,300
What about Ice Monkey, though?

396
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,620
He's a given.

397
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,880
Yeah-wee!

398
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:52,840
Goo!

399
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,160
Okay.

400
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,200
So we're going to go down that one.

401
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,200
And we're going to go on the right side.

402
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,800
And we're gonna keep to the right.

403
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,940
Keep to the right.

404
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,500
Keep to the right.

405
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,000
Keep to the right.

406
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,500
Keep to the right.

407
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:09,960
Keep to the right.

408
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,500
Keep to the right.

409
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,320
When she lies, her nose gets smaller.

410
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,580
Reverse Pinocchio.

411
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,360
Is it gonna send us inside?

412
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,420
No.

413
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,660
There we go.

414
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,660
Comin' in.

415
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,800
Comin' in easy.

416
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,860
Comin' in easy.

417
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,760
Am I upside down again?

418
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,960
I think I am.

419
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,180
Why am I always upside down?

420
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,800
Here I am!

421
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,560
Here I am!

422
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,180
Do a flip!

423
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,560
I wonder...

424
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,660
Let's see.

425
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,040
Nice landing.

426
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,060
I think I'm a professional now, for real.

427
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,540
Oh!

428
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,280
It is!

429
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,600
It is!

430
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:08,900
It is!

431
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,160
It is!

432
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,180
It is this one.

433
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,920
Oh, but it's not here.

434
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,140
Oh, man.

435
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,400
Ah!

436
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,100
Awesome!

437
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,940
Here we go!

438
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,040
Here we go!

439
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,960
She's a professional now.

440
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,580
I know!

441
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,280
I know!

442
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,720
I know!

443
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:31,980
I know!

444
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,820
I know!

445
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,180
This spooky little house.

446
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,040
He almost repeated the elevator.

447
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:40,660
He almost repeated the elevator.

448
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,260
Where was this house at, though?

449
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,440
Actually...

450
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,100
I can't quite remember.

451
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,700
Oh, no!

452
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:50,980
Wait!

453
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,300
We're at the damn...

454
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,720
Oh...

455
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,360
Oh, shucks.

456
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,680
We need to go all...

457
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,100
You know what?

458
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,780
That's fine.

459
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,600
Cowabunga!

460
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:10,780
Easy.

461
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,730
So, maybe it wasn't the most effective way.

462
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,330
But that's fine.

463
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:26,850
Give me in!

464
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,350
Give me in!

465
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,850
Here we go!

466
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,730
On the road again!

467
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,130
What was that about?

468
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,250
This not being Minecraft?

469
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:37,930
It wasn't!

470
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,870
I very much jumped into a deep...

471
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,550
pit of water.

472
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,190
Okay, not yet.

473
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,710
It's past there.

474
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,090
Okay.

475
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,570
Oh, I...

476
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,250
I see it!

477
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,810
Oh, goodness!

478
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,890
It's really tough to get all the way over there.

479
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,250
Okay.

480
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,670
We'll do our best.

481
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,010
Maybe if we, like, propel ourselves from over here.

482
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,170
Okay.

483
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,150
This way.

484
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,310
Over yonder.

485
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,070
Over yonder.

486
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,200
Okay, we got this.

487
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,640
We got this.

488
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,820
Just stick to the right.

489
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,220
Stick to the right.

490
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,880
Stick to the right.

491
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,420
There it is.

492
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,980
The hidden passageway.

493
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:25,960
Nice!

494
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,380
Okay.

495
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,680
Nice, nice, nice.

496
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:31,900
Okay.

497
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,220
We're gonna learn more things!

498
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,060
We're gonna learn so much over here.

499
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,220
We're gonna learn all the knowledge in the world over here.

500
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,600
We're gonna learn all the knowledge in the world over here.

501
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:41,880
To the right!

502
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,300
To the right!

503
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,840
There we go!

504
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,580
Nice!

505
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,800
Straight in the middle there.

506
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,240
Straight in the middle there.

507
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,200
So many eggs on the screen right now.

508
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:01,740
Stop!

509
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,200
Stop this!

510
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,240
Stop this humiliation, please!

511
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,450
Stop this humiliation, please!

512
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,710
What do we have over here?

513
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,250
An elevator.

514
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,450
Come down!

515
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,670
Oh, it's broken.

516
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,290
Just kidding.

517
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,490
Don't fall through.

518
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,430
But we have to find a way to get up there.

519
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,890
Okay, that's...

520
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,370
Question number one.

521
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,110
Don't get crushed again.

522
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,570
We have a thing here.

523
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,770
In an ancient language.

524
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,580
This game be wild.

525
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,680
Yeah, it's so awesome though.

526
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,000
There we go.

527
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,420
Oh my goodness.

528
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,440
New places are so exciting to explore!

529
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,600
So exciting!

530
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,180
So exciting!

531
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,480
Cups!

532
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,160
And such.

533
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,460
Minto gear solid 5.

534
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,180
The phantom egg.

535
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,180
Oh, that's where we just came from.

536
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,920
Okay.

537
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,170
Oh!

538
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,550
Time to go see more culty activities!

539
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,650
This one.

540
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,290
Wow!

541
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,170
There we go.

542
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,510
This way.

543
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,890
There better not be some dead guys down here.

544
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,630
Or else I'm really gonna start thinking that this is a cult!

545
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,170
I'm really...

546
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,410
I'm really...

547
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,590
I'm serious this time.

548
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,190
Uh oh.

549
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,590
Uh oh.

550
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:00,670
Wait!

551
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,170
Were they always wearing necklaces?

552
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,170
Or am I just now noticing that for the first time?

553
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,540
We have to figure out what's going on here.

554
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,020
We're on definitely a time limit.

555
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,680
I mean, I've always been on a time limit.

556
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,120
But we gotta know what that sound is.

557
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,100
We gotta figure it out.

558
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:34,880
Kulto.

559
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,780
What necklaces?

560
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,820
You didn't see them?

561
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,840
Oh, is this another...

562
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,720
Nice.

563
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,690
I have the artifact!

564
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,270
I wonder if I combine this...

565
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,930
With something.

566
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,150
I must combine it.

567
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:58,990
Uh oh, wait.

568
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,250
I need to get a...

569
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,430
Pick it up.

570
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,990
I need to go find a lantern, but I don't know where to get one.

571
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,090
...

572
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:08,790
Oh...!

573
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:16,570
JoJo и JoJo & Komaro Happy birthday to you...

574
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,770
Happy birthday!

575
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,830
Happy birthday to you!

576
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,670
Happy birthday dear Chojo-ko!

577
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,450
Happy birthday to you!

578
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,650
Happy birthday!

579
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,570
Oh, the cult room.

580
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,290
You're so right.

581
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,510
Let's go get a lantern.

582
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,050
I had like 50 in the creepo room.

583
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,310
You're right.

584
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,390
There's a lot over here.

585
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,330
This is exciting.

586
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,810
There's so much going on over here.

587
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:14,170
Now, can I combine the lantern with the artifact?

588
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,550
No question.

589
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,310
In fact, I'm gonna go grab it real quick.

590
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,890
We're gonna bring you upstairs.

591
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,230
You're mine.

592
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:21,970
Conceal?

593
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:22,990
Wait, what does that mean?

594
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,250
Oh, focus?

595
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,470
Interesting...

596
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:35,370
Interesting...

597
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:38,730
Didn't, um...

598
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:40,990
Sorry, hold on.

599
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:41,350
I'm thinking.

600
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,050
Didn't we, um...

601
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,790
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know.

602
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,590
Well, now they know.

603
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:54,650
Um...

604
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,750
There was like one thing that we lit up that, um...

605
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,390
That showed like secret passageways and stuff.

606
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,590
Remember, it showed like the secret, uh...

607
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,830
The secret, um...

608
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,850
Cave.

609
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,470
So I wonder...

610
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,610
If that is what that does.

611
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,590
Hmm.

612
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:15,490
Okay.

613
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,690
We're looking at this, this thing again.

614
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,290
So scary.

615
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:20,850
Oh gosh.

616
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:26,760
Again!

617
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,660
Okay, he lights it up.

618
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,760
The third one!

619
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,280
The third eye.

620
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,700
Okay, so the top one was the first eye.

621
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,220
The second one is the second eye.

622
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,200
And the third one is the third eye.

623
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:46,780
Okay.

624
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,260
Why did I leave it on that one again?

625
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,780
It's so scary.

626
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,390
Jeffrey, are you guys okay?

627
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,650
Why is this game...

628
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,810
Why is this DLC so much scarier than...

629
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,050
Than everything else?

630
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,500
Yes.

631
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,240
That's the thing.

632
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:10,800
That's the artifact.

633
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,080
Your guy is kind of giving Portrait of God vibes.

634
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,700
Don't say that!

635
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,000
It'll scare me so much!

636
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:17,840
Stop!

637
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,560
Nano!

638
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,620
What's wrong with you?

639
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,470
Just go back!

640
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:32,610
excited It's over slaughtered.

641
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:32,770
Damn it!

642
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,150
I'm gonna go death Oh, man.

643
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,250
Oh, my God.

644
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:35,370
He sees me!

645
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,050
Why is this guy's voice so코 wasn't supposed to give me a chance to see him getting worse?

646
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,950
Then, how dare you prof dismiss the Pope really?

647
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,130
Hey, bro!

648
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:45,190
Huh?

649
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,050
What I'll do?

650
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,830
Oh, my God!

651
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,490
I didn't reduce my gauge.

652
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,190
He's scratched out.

653
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,590
He's blinking.

654
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,270
Vtuber.

655
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,190
No, we hate those planets.

656
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,710
We're watching our own planet instead.

657
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:07,790
Our planet rocks.

658
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,190
Yeah, our planet's so cool.

659
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,910
Our planet's the best planet.

660
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,230
They're crying.

661
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,450
They missed their planet.

662
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,730
That's so sad.

663
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,590
Woo, our planet!

664
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,230
Our planet.

665
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,050
Oh god, why did we leave our planet?

666
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,250
It's just, who's taking this video of them crying about their planet?

667
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,350
I have a feeling I used the artifact on these slides.

668
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,050
I'm scared!

669
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:51,510
I'm scared!

670
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:51,770
I'm scared!

671
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,490
There's so many of them!

672
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,050
Oh, the room!

673
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,550
It's the room where they...

674
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,170
Where they...

675
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,890
Wait, can I light it with the...

676
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,570
They're crying because their oshi is late to stream.

677
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,950
No, who would cry over that?

678
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,110
Who would cry over that?

679
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,750
Hello?

680
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,510
Hello?

681
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,090
They're looking at me.

682
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,950
Good night.

683
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,200
And it lights up.

684
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,140
And they fall asleep.

685
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,220
They're asleep.

686
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,140
Okay.

687
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,040
Eepy baby.

688
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,280
So this guy...

689
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,040
If we take it into that room, what will happen?

690
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,060
Artifact does not fit.

691
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Oh, wait.

692
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,600
I'm a little afraid to see what happens.

693
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,220
Time to nap!

694
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,320
What if I go into the room that had the one ...

695
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,880
The one bed that was opened for me?

696
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,520
I'm scared!

697
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,060
I'm scared!

698
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,400
I'm scared!

699
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:25,780
I'm scared!

700
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,160
I'm scared!

701
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,120
I'm scared!

702
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,520
I'm scared!

703
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,660
I'm scared... I'm scared.

704
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:28,660
I was scared!

705
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:28,980
I was scared!

706
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,180
I'm so scared!

707
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,980
Sit on fire!

708
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,340
Light on fire!

709
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,340
Eat a marshmallow first.

710
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,050
Perfect!

711
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,370
Mmm, yummy!

712
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,770
Anyway...

713
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,270
Yeah, all of theirs are lit.

714
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,710
This guy...

715
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,230
When the melatonin hits!

716
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,970
This guy too!

717
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,090
Dang!

718
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,110
Are there...

719
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,690
Are there spoilers?

720
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,130
I will not look.

721
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,850
I see you guys posting some...

722
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,370
What just happened?

723
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,870
Don't touch the fire so much, I guess.

724
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,910
Maybe I got a little too close.

725
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,410
I like that you guys do the four eyes smileys for this game.

726
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,390
Minto, what if you died?

727
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,670
Be careful out there.

728
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,210
Okay.

729
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,550
Let's continue onward for now.

730
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:38,970
Now...

731
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,420
Hmm...

732
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,260
This is an elevator.

733
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,860
No, no, no.

734
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,120
Up.

735
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,320
It does not go up.

736
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,740
It only goes down.

737
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,260
Hey, go down.

738
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,480
Go down!

739
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,310
Is this not where I...

740
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:12,750
Oh!

741
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,590
This is the elevator!

742
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,390
Okay, never mind.

743
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,410
Go up!

744
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,950
Go up, elevator!

745
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:19,710
Go up!

746
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,410
Yeah, this is the broken one.

747
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:27,150
Good to know.

748
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,530
This leads to nowhere.

749
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,480
I don't know how much time we have...

750
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,880
left.

751
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,260
Are those the... that's the...

752
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,100
Oh, the reels are all burned up though.

753
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,660
It's all burned up.

754
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,100
Oh!

755
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,120
Uh...

756
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,230
Am I...

757
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,290
I was gonna say, am I in trouble?

758
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,110
Do we have to come back here when it's...

759
00:34:59,110 --> 00:34:59,410
Um...

760
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,630
When that happens?

761
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:03,270
Uh-oh.

762
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,050
Wait, no.

763
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,270
It won't flood here, will it?

764
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,950
Am I in trouble?

765
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,810
Uh-oh.

766
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:12,530
Uh...

767
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,650
Am I in trouble?

768
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,510
Hahaha!

769
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,550
Um...

770
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,440
Any rush of water?

771
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:22,740
Any rush of water?

772
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:22,820
Oh!

773
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,740
Here it comes!

774
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:26,880
Yeah!

775
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,800
I'll hide right here.

776
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,390
I hear it, I hear it, I hear it.

777
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:37,690
I hear it, I hear it, I hear it.

778
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,810
You're in so much trouble, little miss.

779
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:41,230
You're in so much trouble, little miss.

780
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:46,370
Oh!

781
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,870
I wonder if it floods in here though.

782
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,710
Dang, it doesn't.

783
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,180
That's me!

784
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,400
Okay.

785
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,540
Hmm...

786
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,080
Bye-bye bridge.

787
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,340
Oh no!

788
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,760
We didn't get to go to that side!

789
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:09,880
Hahaha!

790
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,840
Oh man!

791
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,620
Um...

792
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,720
Uh...

793
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,120
It also took the entire house down.

794
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:19,780
Hahaha!

795
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,760
But we have this house to go into.

796
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:21,920
Still?

797
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,220
Still?

798
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,700
The entrance doesn't have radiation.

799
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,520
What do you mean?

800
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,540
I wonder if I do picture mode.

801
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,820
I wonder if I do picture mode.

802
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:35,940
I wonder if I do picture mode.

803
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,220
Oh gosh.

804
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,580
That's like really close though.

805
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,120
That's like really close though.

806
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,520
Yeah.

807
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:48,980
Oh!

808
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,740
I don't think I can go any further.

809
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,640
I don't think so.

810
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,920
For now.

811
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,000
For now.

812
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,420
For now.

813
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
Does this eat?

814
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,020
Wait.

815
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,440
It's the same color.

816
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,440
Focus.

817
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,970
I don't want to die though.

818
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,670
When we're at the end...

819
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,390
When we're towards the end, I'll come back and try it.

820
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,570
I think.

821
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,090
We'll just leave it there for now.

822
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,850
I want to look inside this place real quick.

823
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:40,310
Oi!

824
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:42,750
Oi!

825
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,290
Oh!

826
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,350
If I can.

827
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,130
Wow!

828
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,810
Nice place you got here.

829
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,130
Why is it locked?

830
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,310
What are you hiding?

831
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:53,770
Huh?

832
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,810
An axe!

833
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,720
What are you hiding?

834
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,220
Do it after the music starts.

835
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:08,560
Yeah.

836
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,300
Something like that.

837
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,220
There's a whole lot of...

838
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,380
Nothing.

839
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,300
There's a whole lot of nothing in here.

840
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,700
There's a whole lot of nothing in here.

841
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,100
Just kidding!

842
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,640
Oh my god.

843
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,100
I'm so scared.

844
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:33,900
Wait!

845
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,060
That's a thing right there!

846
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:36,880
That's a...

847
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,820
That's a reel!

848
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,980
I'm so scared of seeing somebody.

849
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,000
Right there!

850
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,200
We need that.

851
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,040
Yeah.

852
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,900
A slide reel.

853
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,120
I wonder if I can get the door from up here.

854
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,340
Like, you know, with the light.

855
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,720
Maybe here.

856
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,500
Launch!

857
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,640
Oh!

858
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,680
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

859
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,000
Okay.

860
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,800
Take it back!

861
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,560
Too slow.

862
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,020
Okay.

863
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:13,620
Launch!

864
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:15,760
No!

865
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,140
Launch!

866
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,640
Take it back!

867
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:18,960
Launch!

868
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,160
Take it back!

869
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,500
Launch!

870
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,900
Take it back!

871
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,260
Yippee!

872
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,060
I told you guys I'm so smart!

873
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,660
Minto tensai.

874
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,840
I know.

875
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,200
I know I am.

876
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,680
Oh, this is a new picture.

877
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,220
They're playing... Oh my gosh.

878
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,640
They're literally playing 4D chess.

879
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,180
Minto tensai.

880
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,820
Minto tensai.

881
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,360
Minto tensai.

882
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,600
Minto tensai.

883
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,620
Minto tensai.

884
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,200
The...

885
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,860
projection room was...

886
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,000
over here.

887
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:05,300
over here.

888
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,640
That honestly took me way longer to figure out.

889
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,500
Oh, it depends on the person.

890
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,880
How long it'll take you.

891
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,400
I have my moments of strokes of genius, okay?

892
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,360
Thank you.

893
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,880
Drop.

894
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,900
Thank you.

895
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,360
Insert.

896
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,200
Incoming four hours for one puzzle.

897
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
That's why I'm saying there's strokes of genius.

898
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,680
What is this?

899
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,840
It's something.

900
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,680
It's a gate?

901
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,180
Why is the music so scary?

902
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,480
I'm trying to tell what's that at the bottom.

903
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,680
There's so many of these.

904
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,200
There's nine of them.

905
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,520
Minto matter.

906
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,560
I can't read it.

907
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,140
Okay, something bad happened to it.

908
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,800
I just got chills down my spine.

909
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,240
The music is so eerie.

910
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,140
It makes me quite afraid.

911
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,780
I'm observing each slide, each little individual pixel.

912
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:22,340
Okay, it's scaring me, so I'm gonna just let that be.

913
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,980
We got the ship log updated, at least.

914
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,600
Is that an egg?

915
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,260
Yes!

916
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,560
How'd you know?

917
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,520
How'd you know?

918
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,940
How much time do you think we have left?

919
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,360
There's also... that's... oh!

920
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,540
Oh, that's the... that's another artifact.

921
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,520
The little lantern symbol.

922
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,040
Do you think I can make it?

923
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:52,720
Hmm...

924
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,660
You think I can make it?

925
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,940
You can totally make it.

926
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,780
Do it.

927
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,760
For science.

928
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,900
But what about this guy?

929
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,480
This is our first time finding an artifact that we can pick up.

930
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,400
What if I bring the real in here, though?

931
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,890
Because it's the real room.

932
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,970
For real homies only.

933
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:21,410
Hold on.

934
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,350
I'm gonna go get the real.

935
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,670
And see what happens.

936
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,630
Because it's the real room.

937
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,070
The room of reals.

938
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:34,530
Like this one.

939
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:35,790
We'll just pick up this one.

940
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,830
Wait, this one already was all burnt up.

941
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:38,270
Wasn't it?

942
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,290
We'll take this one.

943
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,270
What would that accomplish, though?

944
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,590
It could... I think we have to burn it.

945
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:50,090
So then once we use the artifact, we can see new things on the real.

946
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:53,230
On the slides that... because this one had no burns on it, right?

947
00:43:54,410 --> 00:44:00,510
So I think it would... it will reveal more stuff when we use the artifact.

948
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,660
Uh-oh.

949
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,820
Oh, it's time!

950
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,620
It's time!

951
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,160
It's time!

952
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,860
It's time!

953
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,420
It's time!

954
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,240
It's time!

955
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,120
It's time!

956
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,240
Drop!

957
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:34,980
Wait, uh...

958
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,480
Okay, I need to get it a little closer.

959
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:38,980
Drop!

960
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,940
Okay, that didn't do anything.

961
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,200
Drop!

962
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,280
Oh, I died.

963
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,520
I died.

964
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,680
Okay, well, we know that didn't do anything.

965
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,420
You dropped dead.

966
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,060
Wait, there's more to explore in that area, though.

967
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,340
Bam!

968
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:20,580
Bam!

969
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:21,320
Bam!

970
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,140
Bam!

971
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:23,340
Bam!

972
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:24,680
Bam!

973
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,460
Oh, you know what I watched recently, um, on the plane?

974
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,820
I watched, um...

975
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,680
I talked about it before on stream.

976
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,800
But I've been thinking about it quite a bit.

977
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,680
It was uh...

978
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:46,000
All you need is kill, but what's... I can't remember the English name.

979
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:47,800
Um...

980
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:49,520
Uh...

981
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:50,380
Uh...

982
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,320
Not Top Gun.

983
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,080
Not this time.

984
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,320
Edge of Tomorrow!

985
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,040
Yes!

986
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:55,580
Yes!

987
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:59,200
And every time in this game when you're like...

988
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,140
It reminds me of when he wakes up in Edge of Tomorrow.

989
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,700
I really liked that movie.

990
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,440
I really liked it.

991
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,420
Live, die, repeat.

992
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,800
I love time travel.

993
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,940
I love time travel.

994
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,800
I love things where you have to die and relive the same day.

995
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:15,660
Groundhog's Day.

996
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,160
You're playing the My Tom Cruise.

997
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,380
An enormous reservoir with wooden pi...

998
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,340
Oh, wait, that's the same thing.

999
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,580
Hole breach.

1000
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,440
Oh, I found a slide reel in the hidden gorge...

1001
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,460
that showed an explosion blowing a hole in the side...

1002
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,180
of the stranger.

1003
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,140
Yeah, that's totally what that showed.

1004
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,680
Does that mean we should enter from there?

1005
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,240
Instead of entering...

1006
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,900
See, okay, that bottom part down there, I was like...

1007
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,700
Oh, that kind of looks like the entrance I've been going in every time.

1008
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,540
I see.

1009
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,400
I did recognize it.

1010
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,540
That's why I was looking at it.

1011
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,440
It looks like the part where I've been entering...

1012
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,840
from entering the stranger.

1013
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,680
A narrow gorge along the rightmost branch of the river.

1014
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,540
There are dwellings built into both cliff faces high above.

1015
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,540
Several reels...

1016
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:29,560
A slide reel that shows the stranger's inhabitants...

1017
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,860
congregating around a strange green fire.

1018
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,580
Several slides have been burned and cannot be viewed.

1019
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,640
Oh, a slide reel from the hidden gorge showed...

1020
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,200
a glowing symbol and the chains appear around a strange...

1021
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,140
fault.

1022
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,460
Ooh, scary.

1023
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,340
Don't forget to read the lines.

1024
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:50,980
Oh, you're right!

1025
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,420
There are line things too, aren't there?

1026
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,080
Oh, whoops.

1027
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,480
A slide reel from the hidden gorge shows a glowing symbol...

1028
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,900
and chains appear around a strange vault.

1029
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,760
A slide reel from the cinder aisles shows a glowing...

1030
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,280
someone!

1031
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,620
Chains appear around...

1032
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,980
It's just the same thing over and over again.

1033
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:11,700
Wait, what?

1034
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,060
A slide reel from the river lowlands showed a strange...

1035
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,720
strange vault being closed and sealed with chains...

1036
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,560
and a glowing symbol.

1037
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,460
I like, yeah, I really do like that it shows the reels...

1038
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,080
because then I don't have to go back and find them all over again.

1039
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,780
The reservoir, there's more to explore here.

1040
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,340
Oh, in the, okay, the reservoir.

1041
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,820
Yes, because there's that house that we haven't been able to go into.

1042
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,920
I wonder if I can figure, there was the doors that were locked?

1043
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,020
I wonder if it's similar to the puzzle I just did...

1044
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,880
with the light, like, shooting my, like, my little scout in there.

1045
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,640
Okay.

1046
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,410
Solid Mint!

1047
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:58,090
That's me!

1048
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:05,210
I played this DLC and it did not have that feature.

1049
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,130
Yay for quality of life updates!

1050
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:10,710
Yippee!

1051
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,770
Getting the reels to play back in the ship vlog was an unusually hard problem to solve...

1052
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:17,910
for later DLC patches.

1053
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:23,630
I want to try...

1054
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,490
real quick though.

1055
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:27,790
I do want to go back to that one spot, but I want to try and...

1056
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:31,490
find...

1057
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:33,730
the explosion part.

1058
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:34,670
The part that...

1059
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,150
blew up, right?

1060
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,270
It was...

1061
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,010
Wait, if I'm looking at it upside down...

1062
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:43,470
Okay, hold on.

1063
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:46,130
It's on, it's up here, right?

1064
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:55,390
It's like...

1065
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,520
Eep, eep, eep, eep, eep, eep!

1066
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,480
Oh, over here.

1067
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,000
I'm getting all...

1068
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,320
topsy-turvied.

1069
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,100
Oopsie.

1070
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,460
We're fine.

1071
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,640
Everything's okay.

1072
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,380
This side.

1073
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,600
We're okay.

1074
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,440
Gosh, stranger.

1075
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,840
I can't move...

1076
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,500
to the right.

1077
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,940
I can't.

1078
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,740
I can only move...

1079
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,680
I can only move a little bit forward.

1080
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:47,560
Oh.

1081
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,480
No.

1082
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,680
Eeeep.

1083
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,440
You know what?

1084
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,100
I'm just gonna land right here.

1085
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,240
Let's go look at the log real quick.

1086
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,340
Eeeep.

1087
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,340
Eeeep.

1088
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,000
Eeeep.

1089
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,580
Eeeep.

1090
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,100
Eeeep.

1091
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:08,360
Eeeep.

1092
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:15,420
Eeeep.

1093
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:16,580
Okay...

1094
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,460
Okay, it's the very outmost...

1095
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,240
And it's...

1096
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,560
Oh my gosh, it goes so fast.

1097
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,600
It goes so fast.

1098
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,200
I need to see the whole thing!

1099
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,500
Ship's a little roughed up.

1100
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,720
It's okay, we can fix it!

1101
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,500
Okay.

1102
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,640
I think I got it.

1103
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:43,540
Oh!

1104
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:43,840
Oh!

1105
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,300
Goodbye ship!

1106
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:50,780
Over...

1107
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,700
This one.

1108
00:51:59,240 --> 00:51:59,840
Maybe.

1109
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,700
Do I have a flashlight on or what?

1110
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,460
Why do I have a flashlight?

1111
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,220
This is fine.

1112
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:16,330
This one?

1113
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:16,970
Ouch.

1114
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,040
Um...

1115
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,240
Where did my ship go anyway?

1116
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,940
All the way over there.

1117
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,040
It's that one up there, is it not?

1118
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:37,960
No.

1119
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,320
Up, up, up, up.

1120
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,480
Girl is so lost.

1121
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,360
No.

1122
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,040
I'm not.

1123
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:46,780
It's this one.

1124
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:52,510
It's this one.

1125
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:54,650
In the corner.

1126
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,130
Don't, don't run into it.

1127
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,270
Right here.

1128
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:04,190
But my flashlight is not working for some reason.

1129
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:10,510
Um...

1130
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:11,110
Wait!

1131
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:11,730
What just happened?

1132
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:12,110
Huh?

1133
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,660
What just happened?

1134
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,200
Did I go too fast?

1135
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,220
I was coming in a little hot.

1136
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:36,240
I came in... a little hot.

1137
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,080
Sometimes it's really hard to tell how fast you're going.

1138
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,420
When you feel like you're just going so slow.

1139
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,980
Okay, one more time.

1140
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,040
Oh, wait.

1141
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:48,320
No.

1142
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:53,390
Okay.

1143
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:55,290
A tad hot.

1144
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:56,830
We got it this time though.

1145
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,380
Remind us not to accept rides from you.

1146
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:06,720
Look!

1147
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,380
It's harder.

1148
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,660
It's harder to tell when you're not...

1149
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,750
Using your actual body.

1150
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,320
I think I would know how fast I was going if I was using my real body.

1151
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:21,600
My spirit.

1152
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:24,580
Okay.

1153
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:28,960
Okay.

1154
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:31,920
Let's see.

1155
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,900
If we're looking at it...

1156
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,660
So it's that one over there, right?

1157
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:40,680
Perhaps.

1158
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,980
Perhaps it's this one.

1159
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,100
Perhaps.

1160
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:55,310
I'm gonna land slowly.

1161
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,280
Keep the velocity matched.

1162
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,040
Land slow.

1163
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,860
Can I even land actually?

1164
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,540
I don't even know.

1165
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,180
Oh...

1166
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:12,600
Yeah!

1167
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:14,740
Perfect!

1168
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,300
It's that one right there, right?

1169
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,600
I think so.

1170
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:20,660
Please be it.

1171
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,980
Did I find it?

1172
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,380
Wait.

1173
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,860
What's going on?

1174
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,600
What just happened?

1175
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,100
I didn't find it.

1176
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,500
Now...

1177
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,480
Oh, shoot.

1178
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,380
I think I'm lost again.

1179
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:40,820
You guys...

1180
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,520
That was really weird.

1181
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,520
And my flashlight has stopped working again.

1182
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,040
What's happening?

1183
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,420
Why can't I move?

1184
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:56,960
I'm trapped.

1185
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:57,820
Okay.

1186
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,420
There we go.

1187
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:05,030
Ouch.

1188
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:07,990
I can't...

1189
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,050
You scout for me.

1190
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:10,430
You scout for me.

1191
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:11,650
You scout for me.

1192
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:13,470
That's a good plan.

1193
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:14,610
You guys are so smart.

1194
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,730
I don't know why my flashlight has stopped working though.

1195
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,650
I can't even find it.

1196
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:21,870
I'm so confused.

1197
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:23,310
It's...

1198
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:24,010
Here?

1199
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:32,170
Maybe.

1200
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:36,990
I made it.

1201
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:37,370
I lived.

1202
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:38,270
I lived.

1203
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:38,570
I lived.

1204
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:38,910
I lived.

1205
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:39,110
I lived.

1206
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:40,470
I lived.

1207
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:40,510
I lived.

1208
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,650
I

1209
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:44,840
lived.

1210
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,000
I lived.

1211
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:46,160
I lived.

1212
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:46,220
I lived.

1213
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,500
But I don't see the hole.

1214
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,460
I don't even...

1215
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,620
Why am I sideways?

1216
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,660
How do I fix myself?

1217
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:56,520
Oh, road...

1218
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,080
Wait.

1219
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,400
How do I fix myself, you guys?

1220
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,880
I'm sideways and I don't know how to get up.

1221
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:02,920
Outer edge.

1222
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:03,360
Okay.

1223
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,360
I'm sideways.

1224
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,060
Oh.

1225
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,000
Over here.

1226
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,600
I'm sideways.

1227
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,520
I keep...

1228
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,160
I'm trying.

1229
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,280
I'm trying.

1230
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:15,360
I'm trying.

1231
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,200
I'm trying.

1232
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,600
Go, scout.

1233
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:19,860
Go.

1234
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,110
Why am I being pushed away so far?

1235
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,940
Help me.

1236
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,960
I'm afraid you're unfixable.

1237
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:39,820
Shut up.

1238
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,240
How do I get in there?

1239
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,960
50% fuel remaining.

1240
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:54,360
Oh.

1241
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:54,900
This is so...

1242
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,400
I made such a mistake.

1243
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,900
I'm trying to go down.

1244
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,620
But I come in too high.

1245
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,000
Okay.

1246
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:02,400
Okay.

1247
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:02,720
Here we go.

1248
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:03,760
Oh.

1249
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:04,960
Wrong down.

1250
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:05,820
I'm stuck.

1251
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,940
This thing is so...

1252
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:09,980
Oh, no.

1253
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,420
I didn't mean to take the scout back.

1254
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,040
I'm trapped in a hole.

1255
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:19,980
Why is this thing so large?

1256
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:21,880
Oh, my God.

1257
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,340
Ouch.

1258
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,400
Hole.

1259
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:24,900
I'm stuck.

1260
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,040
Oh, no.

1261
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:32,510
I'm inside.

1262
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,920
Oh.

1263
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:46,830
Got it.

1264
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,730
Leave.

1265
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:01,550
I don't like that.

1266
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:03,490
Oh.

1267
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:05,730
Okay.

1268
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,450
No, pick up.

1269
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:11,270
What's this?

1270
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:14,170
It's a working thing.

1271
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:15,730
Let's open this.

1272
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:16,090
I think.

1273
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:17,250
Wait.

1274
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:18,590
Huh?

1275
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:20,430
Close the door.

1276
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,010
It's gonna show me secrets.

1277
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:24,090
Oh, my bad.

1278
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:24,670
Wait.

1279
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:27,570
Close the door.

1280
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:29,470
Close the door.

1281
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:32,890
It's gonna show me secrets.

1282
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:37,290
I think my scout is ruining it.

1283
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:40,630
There's no secrets.

1284
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,900
No secrets.

1285
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:46,900
No secrets.

1286
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,500
Okay, interesting.

1287
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,600
Hello?

1288
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:01,440
Oh?

1289
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,000
Where are we?

1290
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:06,540
Actually.

1291
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:11,770
Uh-oh.

1292
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:13,070
The light thing just happened.

1293
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:13,390
Ah!

1294
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,470
Where are we?

1295
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,210
Oh, new picture.

1296
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:20,050
Nice.

1297
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:23,430
Cute little hmm.

1298
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:30,630
There are secrets somewhere... There to be discovered.

1299
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:41,220
Oh!

1300
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:42,180
Stop.

1301
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:42,620
Stop.

1302
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,580
I keep grabbing that.

1303
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:44,580
Put it away!

1304
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:45,420
Put it away!

1305
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:45,940
Oh!

1306
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,480
Oh grab it.

1307
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,200
Sit down.

1308
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,260
Lock yourself in.

1309
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,000
Look at the fire.

1310
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,080
Close your eyes.

1311
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,750
Become one with the fire.

1312
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:06,170
Okay!

1313
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:12,410
I guess I'll do that!

1314
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:16,330
Sounds good!

1315
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:19,610
Oh, okay, I see now.

1316
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:23,510
So, this part was damaged, but what happened in here?

1317
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,130
There must have... there was an explosion!

1318
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:27,730
So now we know what this room is for.

1319
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:32,470
What happened in here?

1320
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:34,610
What caused the explosion, you know?

1321
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:37,730
Maybe it's a toilet.

1322
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:47,350
For some reason I thought... wait, was one of these fires lit or am I crazy?

1323
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:54,510
I think I'm crazy.

1324
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:57,730
Oh, I'm getting absorbed again.

1325
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:58,970
Let me leave!

1326
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:01,550
Let me leave!

1327
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,110
Okay, there we go.

1328
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,250
I'm trying to grab the artifact.

1329
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:07,530
I don't think it really matters.

1330
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,400
What about the other one?

1331
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:19,700
Side-reel.

1332
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,800
Okay, we're definitely gonna have to come back here because I...

1333
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,040
I took too much time getting in here because I was lost, okay?

1334
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:28,960
What about this one?

1335
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,640
A regular lantern!

1336
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:38,180
And you sit down... and you close the door...

1337
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:43,240
And then... you close your eyes... and you see... the fuzzies.

1338
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:47,380
It also works with a regular lantern, I guess?

1339
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,000
Okay.

1340
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:52,000
Interesting.

1341
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,520
There's the regular one.

1342
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,240
Okay.

1343
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,780
Let's head out.

1344
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,860
Oh, just a window.

1345
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:10,060
That's what an idiot would say.

1346
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:11,240
Just a blank?

1347
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:12,140
No.

1348
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,760
Nothing is ever just a blank.

1349
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:17,740
Where are we?

1350
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:23,880
We

1351
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:33,850
made it to the other side!

1352
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,330
And the bridge is intact!

1353
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:41,410
Yippee!

1354
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:46,550
There's like shortcuts everywhere.

1355
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:50,850
Okay.

1356
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:54,210
I was thinking I should've taken the boat in there but...

1357
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:57,670
Actually, it's good that I didn't.

1358
01:03:57,850 --> 01:03:58,390
Okay, cool.

1359
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:59,070
Let's go in here.

1360
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:03,830
We need to hurry because we need to go to the other side.

1361
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,410
In fact, I'm gonna drop this here.

1362
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:11,490
And I'm gonna go get a lantern right now before this bridge disappears.

1363
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:14,410
Let's go get it.

1364
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:15,590
Run!

1365
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:15,930
Run.

1366
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:16,150
Run.

1367
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:16,430
Run.

1368
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:16,750
Run.

1369
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:17,090
Run.

1370
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:17,510
Run.

1371
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:19,350
Run.

1372
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:19,350
Run.

1373
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:19,450
Run.

1374
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:19,450
Run.

1375
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:19,450
Run.

1376
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:19,450
Rub.

1377
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:20,910
Run.

1378
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:21,230
Run.

1379
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:21,430
Run.

1380
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:21,630
Run.

1381
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:21,790
Run.

1382
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:21,910
Run.

1383
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:21,990
Run.

1384
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:22,090
Run.

1385
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:22,170
Run.

1386
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:23,370
Do you think you're fine on time?

1387
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:24,090
I don't think so.

1388
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:27,450
It's actually close-ish.

1389
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:33,010
Because the electricity thing happened, which we still don't know...

1390
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:34,990
I don't know what that is.

1391
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:37,850
Still not sure.

1392
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,240
Is this always there?

1393
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,820
She has no confidence.

1394
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,000
Have confidence.

1395
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,620
Yeah, gotta listen for the damn break.

1396
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:03,610
Okay.

1397
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:05,450
Hmm?

1398
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:07,090
Okay.

1399
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:09,650
Lamp.

1400
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:11,070
Grab.

1401
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:12,310
Grab it.

1402
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:13,890
Firmly grasp it.

1403
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:15,410
Show your friends.

1404
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:17,990
Lock yourself in the room.

1405
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:19,510
Look.

1406
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,890
Be a little voyeur and observe.

1407
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:24,570
Fall asleep.

1408
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:26,570
Melatonin.

1409
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:29,910
Wake up really quickly.

1410
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:31,070
Speed nap.

1411
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:32,510
Never mind.

1412
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:34,570
Oh.

1413
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:35,810
Use the artifact.

1414
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:39,410
Do the same thing.

1415
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:40,810
Fall asleep.

1416
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,130
Speed run.

1417
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,960
I can see like lanterns very slightly.

1418
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:52,420
Like the lamps.

1419
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:01,190
Something's going on in there.

1420
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:03,070
Oh!

1421
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:03,990
Is that the explosion?

1422
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:08,070
Trees?

1423
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:13,150
It's so hard to tell what's going on.

1424
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:18,110
Oh.

1425
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:21,050
Grab this thing.

1426
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:23,170
Observe.

1427
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:24,450
Speed nap.

1428
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:35,040
Yes.

1429
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,440
This is the thing.

1430
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:41,160
It can't be a lantern or a circle.

1431
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,020
It must be... that.

1432
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:49,060
Okay.

1433
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:49,700
Interesting.

1434
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,180
So this... these ones here.

1435
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,720
The one with the little... spikies.

1436
01:06:59,280 --> 01:06:59,920
Okay.

1437
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:02,780
Hi cutie.

1438
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:03,360
I hope you're doing well.

1439
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,160
Dust call my wife!

1440
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,500
I hope you're doing well too.

1441
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,360
Hahaha.

1442
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,620
We have to fall asleep in a room.

1443
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,840
We have to fall asleep in a room.

1444
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,260
With the artifact.

1445
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:27,860
Do we have to grab the artifact and go into that one room made for one?

1446
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,070
Where was it?

1447
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:34,110
It's at the very beginning though, right?

1448
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:43,110
I don't think... I definitely don't think I have time for it now but we'll try.

1449
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:46,230
Grab you.

1450
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:48,250
Here we go.

1451
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,400
It was...

1452
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,560
Try the room nearer to you?

1453
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,220
I needed like a chair to fall asleep in though, right?

1454
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,820
I think... actually no.

1455
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,600
I don't think I took this in there, did I?

1456
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,060
Now that I think about it.

1457
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:14,740
Oh my god.

1458
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,640
Cult party!

1459
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,400
Hey guys!

1460
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:20,740
Hey guys!

1461
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,620
Everybody ready to slumber!

1462
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:59,060
Oh god!

1463
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:00,760
I'm scared!

1464
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:07,490
I thought we were buddies!

1465
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,450
I thought we were buddies to slumber!

1466
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,200
Yeah!

1467
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:23,460
Hahaha!

1468
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,740
What are we screaming at?

1469
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,100
Cult slumber party!

1470
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:30,120
Officially welcome to the DLC part 2!

1471
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,040
Ah!

1472
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:31,680
Jeffrey!

1473
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:32,340
I'm scared!

1474
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,680
I can't even use my... I just realized I can't even use my thing.

1475
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,700
I can't use my suit.

1476
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:51,960
Oh my god.

1477
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:57,720
Oh, I'm lighting up the...

1478
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,220
There's like little candles.

1479
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:01,180
I'm lighting them up.

1480
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:03,100
What?

1481
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:04,360
Wow!

1482
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:05,920
I'm on their planet!

1483
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:08,880
What?

1484
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:11,420
I think?

1485
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,760
It's really dark.

1486
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:15,860
I can't see anything.

1487
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:16,860
That's why I keep focusing.

1488
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:18,160
Because I can't see anything.

1489
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,000
Thing.

1490
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:20,560
Okay.

1491
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:23,860
Light up.

1492
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:25,120
Okay.

1493
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:32,390
Light up, light up.

1494
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:36,210
This is...

1495
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:38,270
Oh!

1496
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:42,850
There's nothing dangerous in here!

1497
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:44,010
Wow!

1498
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:52,610
At least I didn't draw on your face and sharpie him.

1499
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:57,750
I think it's so cool because I never used the doze off thing.

1500
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:58,790
But then I was like...

1501
01:10:58,790 --> 01:10:59,470
Wait a second.

1502
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:00,770
I can doze off here?

1503
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:01,570
For real?

1504
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:06,710
I can doze off here?

1505
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:09,250
That's what they... They keep telling me to fall asleep.

1506
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:10,570
And that's what I did and it worked!

1507
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:13,050
What?

1508
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:15,190
Where is everybody?

1509
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:16,930
Oh.

1510
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:23,010
They're... They're musical creatures.

1511
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:26,330
Developers cooked.

1512
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:26,930
I know!

1513
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:31,830
Because in like the main game, it just feels like a way to kind of like pass time if you need.

1514
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:34,890
If you need it.

1515
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:38,110
If like you want to like have things go faster.

1516
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,490
But...

1517
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:45,730
It's actually like a mechanic here.

1518
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:46,750
It's so cool.

1519
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:47,550
Okay.

1520
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:48,250
I'll go downstairs.

1521
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,960
I'll search down here first.

1522
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:04,720
Yes?

1523
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,820
I just heard a door open.

1524
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,040
I'm scared.

1525
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,020
Guys, are there jump scares in this?

1526
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:34,480
Be honest.

1527
01:12:56,890 --> 01:12:57,970
Freaking out a little bit.

1528
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:00,930
Oh, that's a tree.

1529
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:02,170
It's not there.

1530
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,690
I don't remember jump scares.

1531
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,050
I do remember regular scares.

1532
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,910
There is a setting for reduced fright.

1533
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:18,770
There is!

1534
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:21,250
There is actually a setting for that.

1535
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:22,710
I

1536
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:35,010
got grabby grabbed.

1537
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:36,230
Wait.

1538
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:36,630
Oh.

1539
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:42,030
I guess... I guess I saw everything there that I wanted to see.

1540
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:09,490
This place... I don't think we're alone, you guys.

1541
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:12,730
He's... He's watching VTubers.

1542
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:25,850
I'm a little afraid.

1543
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:29,750
I'm a little afraid.

1544
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:32,390
Oh, God.

1545
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:37,010
Wait.

1546
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:39,110
I could meditate until next loop.

1547
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:40,650
So there's still loops then.

1548
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:42,110
Are there?

1549
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:46,030
They're family.

1550
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:46,110
Family.

1551
01:14:58,340 --> 01:14:59,680
Will they actually kill me?

1552
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:14,250
What is that?

1553
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:19,460
Oh, God.

1554
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:20,140
I'm so scared.

1555
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:26,530
There's something in here.

1556
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:28,070
But I can't go in.

1557
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:29,150
Oh, wait.

1558
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:30,850
Is this...

1559
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:36,980
No way!

1560
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:40,780
The loop music!

1561
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,400
It's so faint.

1562
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:53,300
What?

1563
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,700
It's... It's him below.

1564
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:05,220
I think it's this guy.

1565
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,500
How do I get in there?

1566
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,040
I'm trying to go say hi to him.

1567
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:15,420
I don't know how.

1568
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,200
They play music.

1569
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:18,020
They can't be bad.

1570
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:21,460
Right?

1571
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,040
Wait.

1572
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:24,780
Is this where I came from?

1573
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:26,940
I'm a little confused.

1574
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:27,980
I'm getting a little lost.

1575
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:38,690
So we are still technically...

1576
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:40,470
Gosh.

1577
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:42,730
Do these people not believe in light?

1578
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:47,970
How are you supposed to see all the time?

1579
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:57,640
This is... Okay.

1580
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:58,880
Okay.

1581
01:16:58,920 --> 01:16:59,280
That's...

1582
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:04,880
It's nighttime.

1583
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:05,620
So!

1584
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,580
Looks like, uh...

1585
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,320
Like a creature that's like...

1586
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,520
Bleh, bleh, bleh.

1587
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,180
Bleh, bleh, bleh.

1588
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,000
Okay.

1589
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,660
We are going to die any second.

1590
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:22,060
There it is.

1591
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:34,330
Okay.

1592
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:37,830
What the...

1593
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:39,750
I was doing like...

1594
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:39,770
It's a monster.

1595
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:59,610
So I'm guessing also, if I do this at a separate little area, like a separate cult area, I will awaken in a different spot.

1596
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:00,770
So let's try.

1597
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:05,690
You really figured out a lot that loop.

1598
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:07,250
Yeah we did, for real.

1599
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,690
And then there should be more to explore, right?

1600
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:14,970
Damaged laboratory.

1601
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:21,510
I feel like we got so much more than it's actually showing.

1602
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:24,730
A laboratory with three test chambers.

1603
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:30,610
A second chamber is badly damaged and can be entered through a hole breach in the side of the stranger.

1604
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:38,810
I saw a vision-like recording of someone picking up an artifact and going to sleep in front of a green fire.

1605
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:43,930
The rest of the vision was distorted and difficult to make out, but a flame seemed to appear inside that artifact.

1606
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:47,350
I found a slide reel.

1607
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:48,650
Oh, whoops, my bad.

1608
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:54,430
That shows three experiments conducted with three different artifacts.

1609
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:56,790
The third experiment appears to have been a success.

1610
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:00,070
And here.

1611
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:03,650
A massive canyon that stretches into the distance.

1612
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:07,850
A candlelit lodge is built into the far cliff face.

1613
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:09,930
There's more to explore here.

1614
01:19:10,230 --> 01:19:12,630
But also, there's more to explore here.

1615
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:14,190
At the reservoir.

1616
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:16,110
So maybe we should go back here.

1617
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:19,530
In fact, I think that's where we...

1618
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:26,180
I think...

1619
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,040
There was another, um...

1620
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,800
Cult place there.

1621
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:32,340
So...

1622
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:39,670
That's a pretty good place to start.

1623
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:41,210
I agree, I agree.

1624
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:44,150
Oh my gosh, this DLC is crazy!

1625
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:50,690
I was like... I was like, it's a little eerie, but like, I'm not seeing what's so scary about it.

1626
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:52,210
Now I'm terrified!

1627
01:19:53,850 --> 01:19:54,810
Thanks a lot.

1628
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:57,070
Team.

1629
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:02,440
Thanks a lot, team.

1630
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,100
Oh, we're coming in hot.

1631
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:09,890
Eeeep!

1632
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,390
The roll never...

1633
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:16,330
Oh!

1634
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:31,980
Oopsie.

1635
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,260
Oopsie.

1636
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:41,380
Oh god.

1637
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:44,720
Sorry, I didn't mean to kill you...

1638
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:46,840
Through suffocation.

1639
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:51,900
Whoopsie!

1640
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,020
Oh no!

1641
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:58,020
Thank you for membership.

1642
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:07,530
There we go.

1643
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:10,550
I'm playing along.

1644
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:11,510
Did the same thing.

1645
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:20,040
Have I ever used the eject function on the ship cockpit?

1646
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,040
I haven't.

1647
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:23,540
I don't think so.

1648
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,460
Here we go!

1649
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:31,120
Welcome to the ship, thank you!

1650
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:33,020
Bravery duck, thank you!

1651
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,160
I believe that Mint will find the egg.

1652
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:38,580
I think so too.

1653
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:40,560
Ooh!

1654
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,920
Coming in a little hot.

1655
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:45,380
Alright, we're gonna roll, everybody.

1656
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:46,960
Roll!

1657
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:48,400
Roll!

1658
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:51,320
Perfect.

1659
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,240
There we go!

1660
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,580
I like watching my shadow over here.

1661
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:05,440
Everything is so big and so small at the same time.

1662
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:08,560
Everything is so big and so small at the same time.

1663
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:16,540
Okay, cool.

1664
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:18,360
This is where we need to be.

1665
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:19,840
This is the ravine.

1666
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:24,360
And we're going down.

1667
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,720
Going down the bayou.

1668
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,320
Going down the bayou.

1669
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:36,230
Taking it all the way.

1670
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:41,470
You guys, stop saying there's an egg.

1671
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:42,490
Only I can see them.

1672
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:42,910
Okay?

1673
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:48,190
Anyone who says that they see an egg is a liar.

1674
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:51,090
The egg is only through Minto vision.

1675
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,000
This one.

1676
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:02,250
Now...

1677
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:05,090
Is the guy...

1678
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:08,990
Is the guy that we're seeing...

1679
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,190
in the other world...

1680
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:15,370
Is he the one that didn't go to sleep?

1681
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:21,410
Uh-oh.

1682
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:22,810
I have to go find an artifact.

1683
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:25,610
So that's what I'm on the way to look for.

1684
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:28,330
Artifacts!

1685
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:31,050
Um...

1686
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:34,030
Maybe...

1687
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:36,730
It was in here.

1688
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:39,350
Artifact.

1689
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:42,150
That's a real...

1690
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:44,950
Oh...

1691
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:47,290
He hatched from the egg.

1692
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:48,470
Hahaha.

1693
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:49,790
Ah...

1694
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,350
I see an egg head in the bottom right.

1695
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:58,650
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

1696
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:00,850
Ay-ay-ay-ay.

1697
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:06,130
Was there an artifact around here?

1698
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:06,690
Or...

1699
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:10,390
Are we gonna have to go searching a little bit?

1700
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:15,110
What did you not explore here while it was dry?

1701
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:17,070
That's a great question.

1702
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:18,250
Um...

1703
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:19,070
I don't remember.

1704
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:19,870
Hahaha.

1705
01:24:21,210 --> 01:24:21,750
Um...

1706
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:25,170
Up here, perhaps?

1707
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:31,690
No.

1708
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,530
This just leads to...

1709
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:35,110
A boat.

1710
01:24:38,930 --> 01:24:40,070
It's there dancing.

1711
01:24:43,190 --> 01:24:43,870
Hi, Mint.

1712
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:44,410
First time here.

1713
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:44,830
Hello!

1714
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:46,910
Thanks for dropping by.

1715
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:48,890
Hello.

1716
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:49,250
Hello.

1717
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:49,610
Hello.

1718
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:53,150
Um...

1719
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:54,090
We're playing Spooky Games.

1720
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:54,470
Uh...

1721
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:56,270
I'm a little frightened.

1722
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:57,630
Right now, I'm fine.

1723
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,380
I have seen the artifact!

1724
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:04,160
You are so correct.

1725
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,080
I do remember.

1726
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:10,200
We have to return to the egg location.

1727
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:13,480
It was under the water.

1728
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:15,460
I...

1729
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:16,480
Or no, it wasn't.

1730
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:18,040
Murphy, thanks for the tank gift.

1731
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:18,360
Hehe.

1732
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:19,180
Thank you.

1733
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,540
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1734
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:24,960
Um...

1735
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:25,500
If I go down here...

1736
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:27,300
Minecraft logic!

1737
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:28,040
Minecraft logic!

1738
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:28,740
Minecraft logic!

1739
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:30,820
We're fine.

1740
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:32,340
Everything's good.

1741
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,160
Uh...

1742
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:39,640
Uh...

1743
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:42,440
Maybe not the best location for that.

1744
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:44,380
Um...

1745
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:46,480
Whoa!

1746
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:47,740
Oh my god, my eyes!

1747
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:56,660
Wait a second.

1748
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,000
Um...

1749
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,880
Maybe I can go there?

1750
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:03,780
Okay.

1751
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:05,640
What?

1752
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,020
Okay, we're safe.

1753
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:12,940
There it is.

1754
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:14,020
Oh no!

1755
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,410
It's like...

1756
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:21,970
Oh, just kidding.

1757
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:22,690
There it is.

1758
01:26:24,190 --> 01:26:24,910
Okay, bye.

1759
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:28,810
Just kidding.

1760
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:33,170
Everything's fine.

1761
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:35,950
Egg.

1762
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:36,450
Egg.

1763
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:36,690
Egg.

1764
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:37,430
Did you see it?

1765
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:37,990
Oh!

1766
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:38,450
Hello?

1767
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:39,130
Hello?

1768
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:42,750
Did you see it?

1769
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:50,060
There's more to explore here.

1770
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:52,640
But I feel like I mean...

1771
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:54,620
Not in...

1772
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,280
This creepy area way, right?

1773
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:06,930
Wait, this isn't the one.

1774
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:10,670
This isn't the one that's missing a guy.

1775
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:12,650
Okay, interesting.

1776
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:13,550
I don't know.

1777
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:13,870
Where...

1778
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:15,370
Which one was that then?

1779
01:27:17,530 --> 01:27:18,710
Time to doze off.

1780
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:26,700
Time to wake up!

1781
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,880
It was at the other tower.

1782
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,860
They won't even let me roast a marshmallow here.

1783
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:40,840
Okay, focus.

1784
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,120
Also, why do I need to conceal sometimes?

1785
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:46,880
I don't like that.

1786
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:48,300
I don't like that at all.

1787
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,280
Is there stealth in this?

1788
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:50,880
Be honest.

1789
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:52,140
Oh, no.

1790
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:54,620
Give it to me now!

1791
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:55,800
Give it to me straight!

1792
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:00,120
If there is, I'm gonna cry.

1793
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,700
Oh, there we are in a different location.

1794
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:15,520
What did I miss?

1795
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,620
Did she redact or redact yet?

1796
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:19,740
Probably one of those.

1797
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:27,220
There is actually sneaking in this?

1798
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,060
Oh my gosh.

1799
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:31,280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1800
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,300
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1801
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,840
My least favorite thing ever is...

1802
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:40,580
is horror game sneaking.

1803
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,020
It's actually one of my least favorite things.

1804
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:47,160
Oh, no, no, no.

1805
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:51,860
Oh, no, no, no.

1806
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,920
I have bad news.

1807
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,620
Popping in to say hi before I get sucked into a black hole of work.

1808
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:03,100
Music.

1809
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:06,260
Thanks for the super chat!

1810
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:13,350
I hear whistling.

1811
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:24,660
It's coming from this way though.

1812
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,200
I can't help but be silent because I'm so scared.

1813
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,560
I'm so scared.

1814
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:50,640
Is it breathing?

1815
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:54,200
Do I hear breathing?

1816
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:01,070
Okay, let's just keep going.

1817
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:05,680
I'm so scared.

1818
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:05,860
I'm so scared.

1819
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:08,400
I'm so scared.

1820
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:19,320
Let's just follow the lights.

1821
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:35,990
I'm scared.

1822
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:48,070
I'm scared.

1823
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:48,990
I'm scared.

1824
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:49,410
I'm scared.

1825
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:51,410
Why are these guys evil though?

1826
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:57,540
Why are these guys going to want to kill me?

1827
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:02,480
How do I get up there?

1828
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,400
Guess we're going down.

1829
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:10,200
Who says they're evil?

1830
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:13,420
Well, then what's going to kill me?

1831
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:16,860
It's all in your head.

1832
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:20,300
You ever think how cute it is that she's always bringing her over here?

1833
01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:29,930
My tummy's starting to hurt.

1834
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:42,450
My tummy's starting to hurt.

1835
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:44,190
Extinguish.

1836
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:53,010
Okay.

1837
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:08,230
Why can't I extinguish them?

1838
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:09,970
Why?

1839
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:10,330
Why can't I extinguish them?

1840
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:12,210
What's over there?

1841
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:19,260
Did you guys hear that?

1842
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,290
Did you guys hear that?

1843
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:30,070
There's something walking in the water.

1844
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:41,760
Wait, how do I get back up?

1845
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:42,760
Uh oh.

1846
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:46,760
Wait, I don't know how to get back up.

1847
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:50,260
Monster.

1848
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:54,180
Monster, can you show me how to get up there?

1849
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:57,460
Hello?

1850
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:57,540
Hello?

1851
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,200
Don't say hello back.

1852
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:08,790
I think that was the dam breaking.

1853
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:17,310
What just happened?

1854
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:19,310
Huh?

1855
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:21,470
Huh?

1856
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:23,010
Oh my god, I'm trapped.

1857
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:25,090
In a bell.

1858
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:26,570
Where am I trapped?

1859
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:27,150
Oh gosh.

1860
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:32,830
I don't think I can get out from there.

1861
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:33,490
Oh.

1862
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:37,490
Get me out of here.

1863
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:38,150
There's bodies.

1864
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:44,460
Oh.

1865
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:45,500
Oh.

1866
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,240
Oy oy oy oy oy oy.

1867
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,680
Did I get caught?

1868
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:53,720
Oh my god.

1869
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:54,400
Did I get caught?

1870
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,180
You do not recognize the bodies in the water.

1871
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:04,300
You

1872
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:12,750
do not recognize the bodies in the water.

1873
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:13,310
Now what?

1874
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:17,190
Now what?

1875
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:17,870
Now what?

1876
01:34:18,470 --> 01:34:19,070
Now what?

1877
01:34:19,090 --> 01:34:22,270
I'm expecting to get jumpscared from Mint getting jumpscared.

1878
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:25,610
I'm sorry.

1879
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:27,770
It's just what happens, you know.

1880
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:29,530
I scream, you scream.

1881
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:30,810
Oh wait.

1882
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:32,250
Wait.

1883
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:34,610
I think my fire went out.

1884
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:38,430
I think my fire...

1885
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:39,510
I think the water...

1886
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:41,450
Wait, but I didn't walk in the water, did I?

1887
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:44,010
Hmm.

1888
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:46,130
Hmm.

1889
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:48,790
The water in here.

1890
01:34:50,150 --> 01:34:52,150
The water in here.

1891
01:34:53,370 --> 01:34:54,130
Ah.

1892
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:54,510
The water in here.

1893
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:57,210
The water walked into you.

1894
01:34:57,690 --> 01:34:57,710
The water walked into you.

1895
01:34:57,710 --> 01:34:58,010
The water walked into you.

1896
01:34:58,370 --> 01:34:59,670
Did it like...

1897
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:02,890
Did exterminating this fire cut it out or something?

1898
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:04,630
Ah.

1899
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:05,910
Ah.

1900
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:09,510
I see.

1901
01:35:13,030 --> 01:35:14,390
So maybe...

1902
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:16,230
The tower...

1903
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:18,390
I need a boat.

1904
01:35:19,690 --> 01:35:20,350
Come here!

1905
01:35:21,650 --> 01:35:23,390
Maybe the tower...

1906
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:27,890
Will be free of...

1907
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:31,830
Excuse me.

1908
01:35:32,790 --> 01:35:33,670
I'm hopping in.

1909
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:33,970
Oh.

1910
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:34,930
Let me in.

1911
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:35,550
Let me in, please.

1912
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:36,450
Thank you.

1913
01:35:37,770 --> 01:35:38,210
Okay.

1914
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:40,810
The tower there.

1915
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:43,250
That's the one that was missing the person though, right?

1916
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:46,050
Don't play this carefree music...

1917
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:47,130
As if you didn't just...

1918
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:49,210
Scare the shit out of me before.

1919
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:51,630
Don't just act like this is some...

1920
01:35:51,630 --> 01:35:53,330
Funky river boat ride.

1921
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:55,890
Don't act like everything's normal.

1922
01:35:56,690 --> 01:35:57,970
Don't be like this.

1923
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:00,170
It's like...

1924
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:00,750
La la la.

1925
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:01,750
So whimsical.

1926
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:04,750
Here.

1927
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:07,810
Wait.

1928
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:08,490
How do I get up there?

1929
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:16,520
And then we have to do it...

1930
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,980
Before the tower falls.

1931
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:19,140
It falls down.

1932
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:19,920
I remember.

1933
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,500
We don't have much time then, I think.

1934
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,620
I don't think we have much time.

1935
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:26,300
Jump.

1936
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,480
It falls

1937
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:40,990
right at the end of the cycle?

1938
01:36:41,230 --> 01:36:41,410
Okay.

1939
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,140
There.

1940
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:55,890
I'm too scared for this.

1941
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,710
I'm too much of a baby.

1942
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:09,430
I'm too much of a baby.

1943
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:11,330
Where are we now is the better question.

1944
01:37:14,010 --> 01:37:15,210
Where are we now is the better question.

1945
01:37:18,690 --> 01:37:19,290
Hello?

1946
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:29,540
If you're gonna kill me, just do it now.

1947
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:30,160
If you're gonna kill me, just do it now.

1948
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,360
Pull me out of my misery.

1949
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:32,640
Sorry.

1950
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:41,620
You guys, there's actually Stealth in this?

1951
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,480
Don't lie to me.

1952
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:46,380
Please, be honest.

1953
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:50,420
Be honest.

1954
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:52,080
I'm too scared.

1955
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:54,000
Hello?

1956
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:57,340
I don't like the whistling.

1957
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:01,620
You play Metal Gear, I'm sure you're fine.

1958
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:02,740
I don't...

1959
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:04,260
Like Stealth!

1960
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:07,450
I'm...

1961
01:38:08,770 --> 01:38:10,970
I've said that since the beginning.

1962
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:12,090
I've always said that.

1963
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:17,590
What's this music?

1964
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,240
What's going on?

1965
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,820
What is going on?

1966
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:32,080
Maybe I should go down.

1967
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:37,890
Hmm.

1968
01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:38,530
Okay.

1969
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:40,090
They're on to you?

1970
01:38:40,190 --> 01:38:40,530
Stop!

1971
01:38:40,890 --> 01:38:41,930
Oh wait, I can't go down.

1972
01:38:42,490 --> 01:38:43,450
I just realized.

1973
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:48,370
Can I see it from here?

1974
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,600
I can't.

1975
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:57,180
Nothing here.

1976
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:01,440
Ah!

1977
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:02,680
No!

1978
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:03,680
Ah!

1979
01:40:11,230 --> 01:40:11,890
Oh, gosh.

1980
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:13,230
Oh, gosh.

1981
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:14,270
Oh, gosh.

1982
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:15,910
Oh, gosh.

1983
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:22,880
Get me out of here.

1984
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,900
Get me out of here.

1985
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,800
There we go.

1986
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:28,100
Ah.

1987
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:30,420
Oh.

1988
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:37,780
What did you do this time?

1989
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:39,140
Nothing!

1990
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:40,320
It wasn't me!

1991
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:42,320
Ah.

1992
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:45,720
We didn't get to explore very much there.

1993
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:48,940
We learned so much.

1994
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:53,340
I guess we did learn that if you...

1995
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:55,140
If...

1996
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:56,920
If the water...

1997
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,460
If the fire goes out in this world...

1998
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,140
Then it goes out...

1999
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:03,800
Uh...

2000
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:06,960
It goes out in...

2001
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:09,640
Then we get forcefully removed.

2002
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:13,840
Okay.

2003
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:15,960
So next loop...

2004
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:18,860
We'll come to this tower.

2005
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:23,590
Okay.

2006
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:26,050
Next loop, we'll come to this tower.

2007
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:30,590
I'm so scared, though.

2008
01:41:31,070 --> 01:41:31,870
I'm so scared, though.

2009
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:32,470
I'm too scared.

2010
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:32,970
I'm too scared.

2011
01:41:38,370 --> 01:41:39,670
Brain is bigger.

2012
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:41,850
Do something cool before it's over.

2013
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:44,370
Yeah!

2014
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:48,530
Yeah!

2015
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:50,150
Um...

2016
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:52,550
Yeah!

2017
01:41:53,310 --> 01:41:53,490
Yeah!

2018
01:41:58,530 --> 01:41:59,770
Nice jump.

2019
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:01,790
Nice egg.

2020
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:02,350
Nice egg.

2021
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:12,460
Whee!

2022
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:15,840
Are we good?

2023
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:19,240
Are we good?

2024
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:19,360
Are we good?

2025
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:19,620
There it is.

2026
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:23,520
I know I can meditate, but I like listening to the music.

2027
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:30,980
I just gleeked all over the place.

2028
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:31,760
I just gleeked all over the place.

2029
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,020
Nasty!

2030
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:38,380
I am feeling a bit better today, though.

2031
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:38,960
So...

2032
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:40,260
I think that's good.

2033
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:49,690
Maybe I'm getting better.

2034
01:42:50,090 --> 01:42:50,650
Huh?

2035
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:51,930
Yeah.

2036
01:42:52,110 --> 01:42:52,970
I gleeked.

2037
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:53,850
Restart!

2038
01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:54,730
Welcome to membership.

2039
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:55,550
Thank you!

2040
01:42:56,430 --> 01:42:58,910
Can't I just stay here, Slate?

2041
01:42:58,990 --> 01:43:00,170
The world!

2042
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:03,130
The universe is too terrifying!

2043
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:08,470
I don't like it anymore!

2044
01:43:09,670 --> 01:43:10,750
Meat is fries.

2045
01:43:11,210 --> 01:43:12,030
Minced thighs.

2046
01:43:12,950 --> 01:43:14,290
Hot dog surprise.

2047
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:15,490
Thank you!

2048
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,300
I can gleek on command?

2049
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:24,480
On demand?

2050
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,220
All these people are demanding me to gleek!

2051
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,600
Do you gleek ectoplasm?

2052
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:31,420
Just a little bit, yeah.

2053
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:36,140
Ooh, she's got bars.

2054
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:40,840
Alex, welcome to membership.

2055
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:41,520
Thank you!

2056
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,700
I can't stop yawning, though.

2057
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:45,480
I think because I...

2058
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:47,620
I woke up early.

2059
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,720
It was a busy day today for me.

2060
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:52,060
Oh, shoot!

2061
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:53,860
I forgot to check, though.

2062
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:55,300
Um...

2063
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:56,480
Okay, hold on.

2064
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:57,960
Once we get inside...

2065
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:58,840
Oh my goodness.

2066
01:43:59,020 --> 01:43:59,540
Coming in hot!

2067
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:00,060
Coming in hot!

2068
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:04,820
And roll...

2069
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:07,520
Nice.

2070
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,280
There's one thing I forgot to check, though.

2071
01:44:11,860 --> 01:44:12,260
Here.

2072
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:15,920
Interesting.

2073
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:17,960
Mint, can you gleek, please?

2074
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:18,920
I can't do it on command!

2075
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:25,620
A secluded village nestled within a cave.

2076
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:28,740
A candlelit tower sits atop a nearby island.

2077
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:39,320
I can't tell what anything is because everything is so dark.

2078
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,720
A dense forest along the banks of a river.

2079
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:44,680
Okay.

2080
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:49,380
This is the one that I couldn't get back up on the, um...

2081
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:51,960
What's it called?

2082
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:54,840
The bridge after we did it.

2083
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:56,940
How am I supposed to...

2084
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:57,960
Maybe I'm supposed to jump.

2085
01:44:58,020 --> 01:44:58,480
I don't know.

2086
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:04,280
Okay.

2087
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:15,600
And we still have this cliffside building that we couldn't make it to.

2088
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,080
The bridge, yeah, had rotted off.

2089
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:18,320
So we have to go away.

2090
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:21,640
And wherever this sealed vault is...

2091
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:23,340
And...

2092
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,940
The reservoir still says there's more to explore here.

2093
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:29,720
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

2094
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:31,760
Um...

2095
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:32,480
What?

2096
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:34,240
More is there to explore in the reservoir?

2097
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:34,920
Oh, the reservoir!

2098
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:35,720
Just kidding.

2099
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,920
I keep thinking of the, um...

2100
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:41,240
The first area that we came out of.

2101
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:46,540
Hello, universe.

2102
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:48,440
Ahhh!

2103
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:51,020
Let's go.

2104
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:51,780
Take me back.

2105
01:46:07,470 --> 01:46:08,870
I'm so sorry, everybody.

2106
01:46:12,490 --> 01:46:14,010
Too much universe.

2107
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:16,110
Yeah, that's the reservoir.

2108
01:46:16,270 --> 01:46:18,370
I keep thinking this is the reservoir right here.

2109
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:21,470
Okay.

2110
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:23,670
To the tower!

2111
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:30,440
Because we'll have the most amount of time to explore.

2112
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:32,020
There.

2113
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:33,040
So I want to go back.

2114
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:36,840
What did you think?

2115
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:37,580
I didn't think I...

2116
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:39,460
I didn't think it was going to force me off.

2117
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:44,420
I thought maybe I would just be looking at the universe.

2118
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:47,620
I thought maybe.

2119
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:52,100
Stop judging me, everybody.

2120
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:52,380
Okay.

2121
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,320
Look at all these eggs.

2122
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:55,900
Wow.

2123
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:10,120
Nice.

2124
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:20,310
There's one around here, but I forget which house it's in.

2125
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:22,070
What do you mean, one around here?

2126
01:47:22,450 --> 01:47:23,110
An egg?

2127
01:47:24,890 --> 01:47:25,330
Oh!

2128
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:26,190
The artifact!

2129
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:27,950
Um...

2130
01:47:29,770 --> 01:47:30,210
Yes.

2131
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:31,030
We must find one.

2132
01:47:31,310 --> 01:47:31,750
Shoot.

2133
01:47:35,290 --> 01:47:35,730
Uh...

2134
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:39,510
I thought an egg.

2135
01:47:40,170 --> 01:47:41,310
I thought an egg.

2136
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:45,350
I've only got egg on the brain, everybody.

2137
01:47:48,430 --> 01:47:48,950
Um...

2138
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:50,130
We can find it, though.

2139
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:51,430
Yeah, see?

2140
01:47:51,830 --> 01:47:54,050
This guy with his antler broken off.

2141
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:00,760
Do you think he's the one that, um...

2142
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:07,760
Do you think he's the one that's stalking the knight?

2143
01:48:12,190 --> 01:48:13,170
I have to watch out.

2144
01:48:13,810 --> 01:48:15,150
My throat is starting to hurt.

2145
01:48:15,290 --> 01:48:15,590
Oh, no.

2146
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:32,590
They said you abandoned us.

2147
01:48:33,610 --> 01:48:35,110
So they crossed out his picture.

2148
01:48:35,230 --> 01:48:36,510
He's not worthy any longer.

2149
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:44,460
Is there...

2150
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:45,700
Is there one around here?

2151
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:45,980
Oh.

2152
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:48,180
I'm really glad I tuned into the stream.

2153
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:53,600
I didn't realize they made DLC for Eggos of the eye.

2154
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:55,820
Eggos.

2155
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:10,120
Um...

2156
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:13,300
You can backseat if you want to tell me because nobody knows where it's at.

2157
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:15,680
Just so we can progress.

2158
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:22,250
Is that a baby?

2159
01:49:25,070 --> 01:49:25,590
Small.

2160
01:49:28,410 --> 01:49:28,930
Small.

2161
01:49:31,310 --> 01:49:32,230
There's no...

2162
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:33,170
There's none here?

2163
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:36,150
I don't think there's any artifacts here.

2164
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:36,610
Oh, no!

2165
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:41,430
The one in the ghost matter building upstream.

2166
01:49:42,550 --> 01:49:43,590
Oh, no!

2167
01:49:49,790 --> 01:49:50,510
Oh, shoot.

2168
01:49:51,310 --> 01:49:53,010
So we came all this way for nothing.

2169
01:49:53,690 --> 01:49:57,590
Okay, so now we know the order of operations must be...

2170
01:49:58,210 --> 01:49:59,330
Grab artifact.

2171
01:50:02,090 --> 01:50:03,110
Head to tower.

2172
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:06,330
The minty.

2173
01:50:07,570 --> 01:50:08,150
Eggos.

2174
01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:13,830
I wonder if I can...

2175
01:50:15,990 --> 01:50:17,290
Upstream or in the canyon?

2176
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:17,410
Canyon.

2177
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:20,110
If I go upstream, how do I get back here?

2178
01:50:24,110 --> 01:50:24,630
Wait.

2179
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:27,170
Was there anything else over here?

2180
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:29,930
I don't think so, right?

2181
01:50:30,910 --> 01:50:31,570
Come on.

2182
01:50:31,890 --> 01:50:32,890
You can make it.

2183
01:50:39,620 --> 01:50:44,620
We weren't traveling fast enough for the music to believe we were playing the game.

2184
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:47,020
It's a loop.

2185
01:50:47,740 --> 01:50:48,260
Oh.

2186
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:49,680
Well, yeah, but...

2187
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:50,800
Oh.

2188
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:56,560
It was here, right?

2189
01:50:58,040 --> 01:50:58,620
Oh, wait.

2190
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:02,220
Wait, I'm confused again.

2191
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:03,800
What is that thing?

2192
01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:05,560
What is destroying the power?

2193
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:09,360
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

2194
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:11,660
Please, please, please, please, please.

2195
01:51:19,190 --> 01:51:20,930
I think I went to the wrong place.

2196
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:22,050
Oh, shoot.

2197
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:22,130
Shoot.

2198
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:30,860
I'm a little lost, I think.

2199
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:34,840
I think I'm a little lost.

2200
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:47,800
Yes, hold it.

2201
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:48,480
Yes.

2202
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:54,860
Actually, I do want to see this place again.

2203
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:57,680
Because...

2204
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:02,120
This is where...

2205
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:05,960
This is where...

2206
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:08,920
I wonder if we can use the scout here.

2207
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:13,560
Go over the dam and grab it.

2208
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:14,720
Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to.

2209
01:52:21,050 --> 01:52:22,710
Because it says there's more to explore in here.

2210
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:26,030
But can we...

2211
01:52:26,930 --> 01:52:28,630
Is there like a mirror or something?

2212
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:43,740
Maybe here?

2213
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:45,060
No.

2214
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:50,740
I'm gonna go out on the lake a bit next time you come through the transition from one theme to the other.

2215
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:51,940
It's my favorite bit of sound.

2216
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:56,200
You're like, hey, can you just not play the game for a second?

2217
01:52:58,840 --> 01:52:59,500
Oh, wait, here!

2218
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:02,380
Maybe.

2219
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:09,940
Uh...

2220
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:14,980
Wait a second, does that mean I have to go in under the water?

2221
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:29,160
Ah ha!

2222
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:37,080
Okay!

2223
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:40,040
Good stuff.

2224
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:42,960
There we go.

2225
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:46,640
Okay, we finally made it in here!

2226
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:47,160
Yippee!

2227
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:50,900
Huh?

2228
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,360
Wait, there was a lantern here?

2229
01:53:58,940 --> 01:53:59,800
Oh, sorry.

2230
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:02,780
Oh!

2231
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
It's inside!

2232
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:05,040
Oh my gosh!

2233
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:08,460
It's inside that bell tower thingy!

2234
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,080
The seal!

2235
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:14,620
The safe!

2236
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:16,260
Good info!

2237
01:54:16,540 --> 01:54:17,880
We got some actual good info here.

2238
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:24,640
Come on!

2239
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:25,480
Don't be so picky.

2240
01:54:29,420 --> 01:54:29,980
Okay.

2241
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:32,320
What is this?

2242
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:34,080
That?

2243
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:35,440
Is it?

2244
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:40,240
There was a way to lift it, perhaps?

2245
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:41,960
Control it in some way?

2246
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:44,820
Okay.

2247
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:47,080
Okay!

2248
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:48,260
That was a good...

2249
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:49,920
That was a pretty big find, I'd say.

2250
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:54,160
Hmm.

2251
01:55:01,050 --> 01:55:03,790
Which maybe we wait for it to drain.

2252
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:09,800
Or?

2253
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:11,000
Not.

2254
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:12,860
Oh!

2255
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:14,580
Maybe we should wait for it to drain.

2256
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:15,540
Or?

2257
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:16,580
Not.

2258
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:20,970
Oh!

2259
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:28,610
If I had an artifact here!

2260
01:55:28,930 --> 01:55:30,730
Oh, shoot.

2261
01:55:31,730 --> 01:55:32,370
Okay.

2262
01:55:33,450 --> 01:55:34,650
If I had...

2263
01:55:34,650 --> 01:55:39,110
If I had an artifact here...

2264
01:55:42,360 --> 01:55:44,520
This is where we will doze off next.

2265
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:47,100
Oh!

2266
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:47,900
Oh!

2267
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:49,420
And it's safe from water!

2268
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:49,960
You're right!

2269
01:55:57,930 --> 01:55:58,410
Hazard.

2270
01:55:59,390 --> 01:56:01,330
It is made of ghost matter.

2271
01:56:03,110 --> 01:56:05,230
It is made of ghost matter, actually.

2272
01:56:05,610 --> 01:56:06,150
It is made of ghost matter, actually.

2273
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:07,090
No wonder it looks like it.

2274
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:08,730
Okay.

2275
01:56:09,590 --> 01:56:10,170
What's up?

2276
01:56:10,230 --> 01:56:11,630
Thank you for the podcast.

2277
01:56:11,730 --> 01:56:14,250
It's been really helping me through my work day.

2278
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:14,930
Thank you, Don!

2279
01:56:14,930 --> 01:56:16,570
Thank you.

2280
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:18,470
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

2281
01:56:18,530 --> 01:56:19,170
Thank you for listening.

2282
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:24,130
Okay.

2283
01:56:24,710 --> 01:56:25,330
Um...

2284
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:29,630
Uh...

2285
01:56:29,630 --> 01:56:30,070
Uh...

2286
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:32,370
Guys, you'll have to remind me.

2287
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:34,990
How do I...

2288
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:35,510
How do I...

2289
01:56:35,510 --> 01:56:36,430
get up?

2290
01:56:38,110 --> 01:56:43,370
You have to remind me where another artifact was.

2291
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:45,790
There wasn't one over here, right?

2292
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:47,990
I think we have to wait for the dam to break.

2293
01:56:48,990 --> 01:56:49,430
Well...

2294
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:57,520
There was one by the egg.

2295
01:56:58,080 --> 01:56:58,520
Yes!

2296
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:00,440
Yes.

2297
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:06,560
Maybe I shouldn't wait.

2298
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:07,580
Maybe I should just go.

2299
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:11,120
I think I'm gonna fly down.

2300
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:19,400
I think I'm just gonna fly down.

2301
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:21,500
Oh!

2302
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:22,200
Nevermind!

2303
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:24,720
Hahaha!

2304
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:26,660
Uh...

2305
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:28,120
Here we go!

2306
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:31,060
Kaboosh!

2307
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:38,300
Look at it lowering.

2308
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,140
So cool!

2309
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:43,560
So, so cool.

2310
01:57:43,940 --> 01:57:53,200
So I'm guessing whatever powers off or whatever happens here is what causes the um... wait.

2311
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:55,020
It's here, right?

2312
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:59,040
Where is the ghost matter place?

2313
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:01,940
Ghost matter!

2314
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:03,560
Ghost matter!

2315
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:03,980
Where's the matter?

2316
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:15,350
Oh, there it is!

2317
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:17,070
Okay, nice.

2318
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:27,190
Um, I'm guessing whatever explodes or like messes with the power is what causes the um...

2319
01:58:29,370 --> 01:58:30,790
the dam to break.

2320
01:58:31,390 --> 01:58:33,310
That's my hypothesis.

2321
01:58:34,170 --> 01:58:38,670
Also, so the ghost matter is nullified by water.

2322
01:58:40,210 --> 01:58:43,890
So that one makes sense why the fire is also...

2323
01:58:44,730 --> 01:58:45,210
Hi!

2324
01:58:49,770 --> 01:58:50,730
Can I...

2325
01:58:50,730 --> 01:58:52,490
Do I have to loop all... I think I have to loop.

2326
01:58:52,790 --> 01:58:53,410
Let's go.

2327
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:54,430
Let's go quickly.

2328
01:58:54,930 --> 01:59:00,430
I haven't watched much because I still want to play the game myself, but I hope you're doing well.

2329
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:03,090
Stop by and send some love and support.

2330
01:59:03,210 --> 01:59:03,830
Thank you, Kinky!

2331
01:59:05,010 --> 01:59:06,310
It's getting crazy.

2332
01:59:06,450 --> 01:59:07,690
Oh, oh, that's a tree.

2333
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:10,730
I thought it was just a bush.

2334
01:59:14,290 --> 01:59:17,530
Is it normal fire or nullified by water though?

2335
01:59:18,510 --> 01:59:21,630
Oh, we didn't know what the ghost matter was before.

2336
01:59:23,630 --> 01:59:24,270
So...

2337
01:59:24,270 --> 01:59:26,030
You know...

2338
01:59:29,170 --> 01:59:29,990
You know...

2339
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:30,810
It's...

2340
01:59:32,690 --> 01:59:33,970
You know...

2341
01:59:38,670 --> 01:59:40,030
So it's a ghost fire.

2342
01:59:40,250 --> 01:59:40,350
So it's a ghost fire.

2343
01:59:40,550 --> 01:59:41,690
A will-o-wisp.

2344
01:59:43,390 --> 01:59:44,870
I'm starting to get kind of hungry.

2345
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:45,390
I'm starting to get kind of hungry.

2346
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:54,160
Over...

2347
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:55,420
Over...

2348
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:55,740
Okay.

2349
01:59:59,470 --> 02:00:01,770
Now here's where it's tricky because the...

2350
02:00:02,890 --> 02:00:05,110
The current seems a little strong here.

2351
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:13,580
Oh my god, we're going to doze off in here?

2352
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:17,080
And it's not going to be some terrifying thing?

2353
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:19,200
The creepy guys, right?

2354
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:21,680
It's going to be normal probably.

2355
02:00:22,700 --> 02:00:23,760
It's going to be great.

2356
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:26,040
It's going to be less scary than the other ones.

2357
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:28,760
Because the guys disappear in the other ones.

2358
02:01:00,630 --> 02:01:01,490
Matara gone.

2359
02:01:12,710 --> 02:01:13,610
There's an elevator.

2360
02:01:14,830 --> 02:01:15,350
Okay.

2361
02:01:18,390 --> 02:01:20,050
Okay, I guess we got to go down.

2362
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:39,760
A hole.

2363
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:43,100
Aha.

2364
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:44,360
Wait.

2365
02:01:45,660 --> 02:01:47,060
Those are the locks?

2366
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:51,380
Those are the locks.

2367
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:52,080
Those are the locks.

2368
02:01:56,830 --> 02:01:57,990
For Matara.

2369
02:01:58,490 --> 02:01:59,730
We're going to lock her up.

2370
02:02:02,510 --> 02:02:03,630
Use interface.

2371
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:06,010
Oh no, I don't know the password.

2372
02:02:10,270 --> 02:02:11,690
Oh, I don't know the password.

2373
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:12,270
Okay.

2374
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:16,540
That's...

2375
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:18,640
Oh, there she is.

2376
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:19,680
Hi.

2377
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:22,300
Secret language.

2378
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:24,280
Rotate.

2379
02:02:36,170 --> 02:02:36,730
Oh.

2380
02:02:38,010 --> 02:02:38,570
There?

2381
02:02:40,910 --> 02:02:41,410
What's there?

2382
02:02:44,250 --> 02:02:46,470
I'm having visions, you guys.

2383
02:02:47,650 --> 02:02:49,770
I'm having some crazy visions.

2384
02:02:50,190 --> 02:02:50,750
There?

2385
02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:54,070
Take that.

2386
02:02:57,410 --> 02:02:58,050
Aha.

2387
02:03:02,170 --> 02:03:02,810
Okay.

2388
02:03:02,910 --> 02:03:03,950
In the tower.

2389
02:03:04,430 --> 02:03:05,330
Fall asleep.

2390
02:03:05,590 --> 02:03:05,930
Good night.

2391
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:12,840
Aha.

2392
02:03:16,340 --> 02:03:17,120
Wait, what?

2393
02:03:23,610 --> 02:03:24,290
What?

2394
02:03:25,630 --> 02:03:26,930
What did that mean?

2395
02:03:27,230 --> 02:03:28,470
Where are the subtitles?

2396
02:03:29,610 --> 02:03:31,330
Mr. Meaty Cougar.

2397
02:03:31,770 --> 02:03:32,730
Welcome to Mavishif.

2398
02:03:32,730 --> 02:03:33,170
Thank you.

2399
02:03:33,370 --> 02:03:35,530
I got stuck on this for like two hours.

2400
02:03:37,570 --> 02:03:38,250
That...

2401
02:03:39,010 --> 02:03:40,610
was a little confusing.

2402
02:03:52,260 --> 02:03:53,040
Wee-woo.

2403
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:56,280
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye.

2404
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:00,420
I was busy there.

2405
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:01,260
Excuse you.

2406
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:03,040
I was working on stuff.

2407
02:04:09,020 --> 02:04:09,900
I'll just go back.

2408
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:11,920
Who are you to stop me, huh?

2409
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:14,260
Yeah, that's right.

2410
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:15,340
I'm just gonna go back.

2411
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:21,920
Oh.

2412
02:04:22,580 --> 02:04:23,060
Good.

2413
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:23,600
Yeah.

2414
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:25,240
We're fine.

2415
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:27,640
Let me actually wake you up.

2416
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:40,650
All right.

2417
02:04:41,330 --> 02:04:42,670
Maybe if I can seal my...

2418
02:04:43,070 --> 02:04:44,170
my flame instead.

2419
02:04:50,860 --> 02:04:53,420
I'm not sure...

2420
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:55,920
Oh, the candles are still lit and everything.

2421
02:04:57,580 --> 02:04:59,540
I guess they stay that way...

2422
02:04:59,540 --> 02:05:00,820
for the cycle.

2423
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:03,920
How do we get...

2424
02:05:04,220 --> 02:05:05,920
the codes for these?

2425
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:11,920
Hello?

2426
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:14,660
Oh.

2427
02:05:19,690 --> 02:05:21,070
It's time, everybody.

2428
02:05:23,630 --> 02:05:24,750
I believe.

2429
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:25,750
It's time.

2430
02:05:42,210 --> 02:05:42,770
Run!

2431
02:05:42,950 --> 02:05:43,170
Run!

2432
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:43,790
Just go!

2433
02:05:43,910 --> 02:05:44,290
Just run!

2434
02:05:47,870 --> 02:05:48,430
Oh!

2435
02:05:53,430 --> 02:05:54,370
So cool!

2436
02:05:54,810 --> 02:05:56,830
It goes to the normal music now.

2437
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,420
No, we'll listen to the music.

2438
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:12,460
And then I'll die.

2439
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:16,800
Bling!

2440
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:17,320
Bling!

2441
02:06:18,820 --> 02:06:19,540
Bling!

2442
02:06:19,540 --> 02:06:19,880
Bling!

2443
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:20,520
Bling!

2444
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:23,260
Marshmallow at the end of the world.

2445
02:06:25,060 --> 02:06:25,920
You know it.

2446
02:06:27,060 --> 02:06:28,380
And cooked...

2447
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:29,320
to...

2448
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:30,200
perfection.

2449
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:36,040
Actually, I prefer mine burnt.

2450
02:06:36,820 --> 02:06:37,440
Ow!

2451
02:06:50,260 --> 02:06:52,360
Eat ten burnt marshmallows!

2452
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:54,200
Mmm, carcinogens...

2453
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:56,020
is the...

2454
02:06:58,200 --> 02:06:59,180
is the...

2455
02:06:59,180 --> 02:06:59,600
is the achievement.

2456
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:19,680
Huh?

2457
02:07:23,380 --> 02:07:24,060
Oh.

2458
02:07:27,830 --> 02:07:29,010
That was weird.

2459
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:32,530
I meditated...

2460
02:07:32,530 --> 02:07:34,010
and I woke up in...

2461
02:07:34,890 --> 02:07:36,190
the other world.

2462
02:07:38,870 --> 02:07:40,470
Because you slept at the fire.

2463
02:07:40,730 --> 02:07:42,110
I meditated at the fire.

2464
02:07:45,690 --> 02:07:46,750
Wait, can I do that?

2465
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:48,270
Instead of just looping?

2466
02:07:48,290 --> 02:07:49,510
I mean, instead of dozing off?

2467
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:09,060
Very cool.

2468
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:11,460
It's a nice little touch, right?

2469
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:17,600
Submerged structure.

2470
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:18,900
Subterranean...

2471
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:21,340
Subterranean animism.

2472
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:23,380
Subterranean lake.

2473
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:25,780
A large metal structure...

2474
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:26,640
is suspended by chains.

2475
02:08:26,840 --> 02:08:28,400
It can be entered by swimming from below.

2476
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:31,440
A sealed vault illuminated by green fire...

2477
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:32,660
inside the structure.

2478
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:35,620
I discovered a vast...

2479
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:37,400
subterranean lake beneath the...

2480
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:38,100
submerged structure.

2481
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:41,580
The sealed vault is resting on the shore of the lake.

2482
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:45,720
There are three interfaces, each marked with one of the three symbols...

2483
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:46,240
from the vault.

2484
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:49,300
I rotated the mechanism in front of the vault, causing it to...

2485
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:51,120
strain against the chains holding it shut.

2486
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:53,440
Moments later, rays of green light...

2487
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:54,900
spilled out of the vault.

2488
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:56,800
We're just gonna totally ignore the...

2489
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,160
the hallucinations.

2490
02:08:58,220 --> 02:08:58,740
I got it.

2491
02:08:58,940 --> 02:08:59,700
I got it.

2492
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:00,220
I got you.

2493
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:03,760
Oh.

2494
02:09:04,460 --> 02:09:05,920
I found a strange vault...

2495
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:08,660
wrapped in chains and marked with three glowing symbols.

2496
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,840
Slide reel from river lowlands...

2497
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:12,080
showed... oh yes.

2498
02:09:12,640 --> 02:09:13,600
Oh, wait wait wait.

2499
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:18,920
Slide reel from the hidden gorge showed a glowing symbol...

2500
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:20,380
and chains appear around...

2501
02:09:20,380 --> 02:09:21,400
a strange vault.

2502
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:23,080
Okay.

2503
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:30,700
The light coming out from the vault...

2504
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:31,660
showed a vision...

2505
02:09:31,660 --> 02:09:32,280
Oh, here it is.

2506
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:33,160
Here's our vision.

2507
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:36,860
A vision of climbing a spiral staircase...

2508
02:09:36,860 --> 02:09:38,400
to a room near the top of a tower.

2509
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:41,080
One of the stranger's inhabitants...

2510
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:43,180
pointed at a mural of an identical tower...

2511
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:44,560
beneath a ringed planet.

2512
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:47,420
Then picked up an artifact...

2513
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:49,560
and carried it downstairs to a room with a green fire.

2514
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:50,880
Sometime later...

2515
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:53,220
two of the lamps in the mural room turned off...

2516
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,660
plunging the mural into darkness...

2517
02:09:55,660 --> 02:09:57,240
and revealing a secret passage.

2518
02:09:59,260 --> 02:10:00,480
The passage led...

2519
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:01,920
to three wooden containers...

2520
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,640
each marked with a glowing vault seal.

2521
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:06,140
Okay.

2522
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:09,220
So...

2523
02:10:11,260 --> 02:10:12,300
What I'm...

2524
02:10:12,980 --> 02:10:14,560
Can I just move the...

2525
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:16,340
the glowing?

2526
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:19,240
Let's go back to that tower...

2527
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:19,740
and check it out.

2528
02:10:27,270 --> 02:10:28,770
Seems like some people are...

2529
02:10:28,770 --> 02:10:30,950
saying that they are getting stuck on this part.

2530
02:10:31,330 --> 02:10:31,670
Hahaha.

2531
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:32,810
We'll see about that.

2532
02:10:32,830 --> 02:10:33,490
Let's see if we can figure it out.

2533
02:10:40,740 --> 02:10:41,780
Cause it's...

2534
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:42,820
I have to go?

2535
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:43,560
Wait.

2536
02:10:49,450 --> 02:10:50,290
If I...

2537
02:10:51,210 --> 02:10:53,490
go down with the artifact...

2538
02:10:53,490 --> 02:10:54,390
do I have to fall asleep?

2539
02:10:55,970 --> 02:10:57,250
I'm not quite sure.

2540
02:10:58,330 --> 02:10:59,310
We'll experiment.

2541
02:11:01,910 --> 02:11:03,090
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2542
02:11:04,210 --> 02:11:04,750
Velocity.

2543
02:11:06,850 --> 02:11:08,310
Coming in hot, coming in hot.

2544
02:11:11,130 --> 02:11:13,290
Eating Mike Tyson's ass.

2545
02:11:13,770 --> 02:11:14,750
Thanks for two months.

2546
02:11:15,130 --> 02:11:16,710
And thanks for the five...

2547
02:11:16,710 --> 02:11:17,230
gifted.

2548
02:11:19,050 --> 02:11:20,450
He's eating ass.

2549
02:11:20,830 --> 02:11:21,710
He's eating ass.

2550
02:11:23,970 --> 02:11:25,030
Will it always...

2551
02:11:25,030 --> 02:11:26,210
be Mike Tyson's ass?

2552
02:11:26,410 --> 02:11:26,870
Or...

2553
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,360
Is that just what you prefer?

2554
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:46,020
It will forever be MTA.

2555
02:11:46,740 --> 02:11:47,380
Hahaha.

2556
02:11:48,060 --> 02:11:48,700
Okay.

2557
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:49,440
Um...

2558
02:11:53,990 --> 02:11:55,270
We'll just use the raft.

2559
02:12:03,430 --> 02:12:04,650
Go over here.

2560
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:09,630
In fact, I'll just...

2561
02:12:09,630 --> 02:12:09,950
dock.

2562
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:14,600
I'm getting quite good at that.

2563
02:12:14,860 --> 02:12:16,300
It will always be...

2564
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:17,060
Mike Tyson.

2565
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:17,800
Hahaha.

2566
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:21,880
Understandable.

2567
02:12:26,220 --> 02:12:26,860
Minecraft.

2568
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:28,280
Physics.

2569
02:12:41,410 --> 02:12:42,050
Oh!

2570
02:12:42,470 --> 02:12:42,910
Ouch.

2571
02:12:43,590 --> 02:12:44,510
We're fine.

2572
02:12:44,830 --> 02:12:45,550
Oink.

2573
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:52,440
Grab that.

2574
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:54,440
See ya.

2575
02:12:56,660 --> 02:12:58,540
Important game breaking spoilers.

2576
02:12:59,020 --> 02:12:59,740
Mince cute.

2577
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:07,060
Oh, how do I...

2578
02:13:07,060 --> 02:13:07,940
get back up to my boat?

2579
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:09,120
Oh, just kidding.

2580
02:13:20,980 --> 02:13:22,160
Okie dokie.

2581
02:13:22,360 --> 02:13:23,760
Let's ignore that spoiler.

2582
02:13:24,700 --> 02:13:26,200
Mods, ban the spoiler.

2583
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:29,100
Ban the person...

2584
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:29,480
that spoils.

2585
02:13:33,740 --> 02:13:34,340
Um...

2586
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:35,820
We're going back to the tower.

2587
02:13:36,700 --> 02:13:38,320
The tower to the tower.

2588
02:13:42,140 --> 02:13:42,740
Hahaha.

2589
02:13:45,790 --> 02:13:46,690
Over here.

2590
02:13:49,770 --> 02:13:51,750
This is where we were trying to do before.

2591
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:52,530
Wasn't it?

2592
02:13:57,890 --> 02:13:58,490
Okay.

2593
02:14:02,930 --> 02:14:03,930
Here we go.

2594
02:14:05,550 --> 02:14:06,510
I don't remember.

2595
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:07,610
What was in this cave?

2596
02:14:09,070 --> 02:14:10,830
Actually can't quite remember.

2597
02:14:34,350 --> 02:14:35,150
Oh, that's right.

2598
02:14:35,190 --> 02:14:35,810
The secret stairs.

2599
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:43,800
Can I like...

2600
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:47,440
Wee!

2601
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:48,820
Okay.

2602
02:14:48,940 --> 02:14:49,660
We're just gonna...

2603
02:14:49,660 --> 02:14:51,760
We're just gonna brute force it here.

2604
02:14:55,990 --> 02:14:56,510
Nice.

2605
02:14:57,550 --> 02:14:58,070
Hahaha.

2606
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:01,230
Alright.

2607
02:15:01,310 --> 02:15:01,490
Nice.

2608
02:15:06,730 --> 02:15:10,190
So basically, he goes and looks at the picture.

2609
02:15:11,970 --> 02:15:13,350
He says, Nice picture.

2610
02:15:14,390 --> 02:15:16,810
And then he goes down and lights the fire.

2611
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:19,370
And then he...

2612
02:15:21,750 --> 02:15:23,210
goes back up.

2613
02:15:23,730 --> 02:15:24,530
And then he...

2614
02:15:24,530 --> 02:15:28,110
Do you think calling Minto cute as a spoiler is like saying Romeo and Juliet?

2615
02:15:28,490 --> 02:15:28,770
Do you think calling Minto cute as a spoiler is like saying Romeo and Juliet?

2616
02:15:29,110 --> 02:15:30,170
Is it tragic?

2617
02:15:30,730 --> 02:15:32,390
Being a tragedy is a spoiler?

2618
02:15:32,490 --> 02:15:32,670
No.

2619
02:15:32,810 --> 02:15:33,730
What do you mean?

2620
02:15:36,150 --> 02:15:37,110
I saw this one.

2621
02:15:37,250 --> 02:15:38,110
Yes, yes, yes.

2622
02:15:39,870 --> 02:15:41,810
Okay, so we need these to go out.

2623
02:15:42,270 --> 02:15:42,670
Eventually.

2624
02:15:44,410 --> 02:15:45,890
Okay, so I'm looking at it.

2625
02:15:46,470 --> 02:15:46,870
Wow.

2626
02:15:48,190 --> 02:15:48,890
I'm looking.

2627
02:15:49,010 --> 02:15:49,630
I'm viewing.

2628
02:15:49,890 --> 02:15:50,270
Okay.

2629
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:55,020
What's up here?

2630
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:01,760
The top of the world.

2631
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:02,600
Oh, that's right!

2632
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:03,000
Here!

2633
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:13,880
This is the one spot we haven't gone to.

2634
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:14,560
I think.

2635
02:16:19,070 --> 02:16:19,470
Oh.

2636
02:16:19,530 --> 02:16:20,590
I think I can just jump.

2637
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:23,430
I think it's fine.

2638
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:31,000
Let's go over here.

2639
02:16:44,380 --> 02:16:46,380
It sounds like it's coming from over here.

2640
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:48,520
Like the sound.

2641
02:16:52,140 --> 02:16:53,880
But this thing doesn't stop spinning.

2642
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:57,260
Does it?

2643
02:16:59,020 --> 02:17:00,200
No, I don't think so.

2644
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:03,660
It's the egg.

2645
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:05,000
Enough with the egg!

2646
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:10,680
No, it's still spinning.

2647
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:20,980
Hmm.

2648
02:17:26,220 --> 02:17:26,840
I

2649
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:32,950
feel like I'm not doing this correctly.

2650
02:17:33,250 --> 02:17:35,210
But I'm still... there's an attempt.

2651
02:17:40,340 --> 02:17:41,120
Come on.

2652
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:42,100
Use your legs.

2653
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:42,580
Come on.

2654
02:17:54,260 --> 02:17:55,580
Do I doze off?

2655
02:18:05,520 --> 02:18:06,080
Oh!

2656
02:18:13,160 --> 02:18:14,660
I hate being here.

2657
02:18:18,230 --> 02:18:20,050
I can't extinguish it.

2658
02:18:21,890 --> 02:18:23,710
Oh lordy, I hate being here.

2659
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:38,800
I hate this so much.

2660
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:43,800
So...

2661
02:18:44,540 --> 02:18:45,780
This is the tower.

2662
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:52,420
We have to get back some...

2663
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:53,640
Wait, can I just...

2664
02:18:55,380 --> 02:18:56,900
Can I just wake up?

2665
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:06,240
And then I go back up, right?

2666
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,660
So then we go...

2667
02:19:22,660 --> 02:19:23,240
Wait!

2668
02:19:27,740 --> 02:19:28,260
Okay...

2669
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:36,640
Let's see if this worked.

2670
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,300
Maybe?

2671
02:19:39,360 --> 02:19:40,500
I'm not sure.

2672
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:49,180
Oh, wrong way.

2673
02:19:50,020 --> 02:19:52,480
My eyes become wide when I'm focusing.

2674
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:54,100
It's cause I'm scared.

2675
02:19:55,720 --> 02:19:56,620
Stop it.

2676
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:01,980
Sorry they have big buggy eyes.

2677
02:20:06,660 --> 02:20:07,380
No!

2678
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:11,700
It didn't work.

2679
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:27,080
Hmm.

2680
02:20:31,020 --> 02:20:31,800
Destroy it.

2681
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:37,360
Destroy!

2682
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:39,040
Destroy!

2683
02:20:39,780 --> 02:20:40,280
Launch!

2684
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:41,700
Launch!

2685
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:44,540
Hmm...

2686
02:20:57,150 --> 02:20:58,890
This one took me a while.

2687
02:21:01,010 --> 02:21:04,390
These are different types of lamps, so I don't think they break in the water.

2688
02:21:05,950 --> 02:21:09,210
I mean, they should when the whole tower comes down, but you know.

2689
02:21:10,510 --> 02:21:11,010
Hmm...

2690
02:21:36,260 --> 02:21:38,560
Do I have to spend more time in there or something?

2691
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:39,540
Or...

2692
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:43,580
Maybe the more lights... Well, no.

2693
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:47,760
I was gonna say the more lights I light up in there, the ones turn off out here.

2694
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:55,820
Does the tower on the other side have a room like this too?

2695
02:21:57,640 --> 02:22:00,220
I don't think I could access it if it does.

2696
02:22:03,060 --> 02:22:03,500
Hmm...

2697
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:07,020
But I think the...

2698
02:22:07,020 --> 02:22:07,360
Oops.

2699
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:10,720
It's this door that opens though, right?

2700
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:13,660
Because it's... this is the one that it showed.

2701
02:22:14,260 --> 02:22:19,400
It said that the lanterns turned off in here and then the door opened up in here.

2702
02:22:34,530 --> 02:22:37,310
True, but it did show the guy carrying the artifact out.

2703
02:22:38,470 --> 02:22:40,050
What, like it was lit up?

2704
02:22:42,070 --> 02:22:43,010
I can't remember.

2705
02:22:52,850 --> 02:22:54,190
It gets me every time.

2706
02:22:54,190 --> 02:22:54,890
Hehehe.

2707
02:22:57,530 --> 02:22:57,930
Aaaaaah!

2708
02:23:01,780 --> 02:23:03,460
I wish I could see the logs.

2709
02:23:06,040 --> 02:23:06,440
Ohoho.

2710
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:08,380
I wish I could see the logs.

2711
02:23:26,330 --> 02:23:26,730
Hmm...

2712
02:23:28,550 --> 02:23:29,350
Big yawn.

2713
02:23:30,250 --> 02:23:30,910
Oh, my EP.

2714
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:39,300
Also, my throat's starting to hurt a little bit.

2715
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:40,620
Not a little bit, a lot of it.

2716
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:47,300
Check the reel.

2717
02:23:48,420 --> 02:23:48,820
Check the reel?

2718
02:23:48,820 --> 02:23:49,620
The one that I just left?

2719
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:57,290
The one that I just left?

2720
02:23:57,290 --> 02:24:00,390
It'd be convenient in here, especially since it's tough to get back to the ship.

2721
02:24:00,490 --> 02:24:01,890
Yeah, I think that's the only thing.

2722
02:24:03,610 --> 02:24:04,010
Um...

2723
02:24:04,850 --> 02:24:06,350
If I have to meditate, that's okay.

2724
02:24:08,730 --> 02:24:09,130
Oops.

2725
02:24:11,610 --> 02:24:12,510
What was in here?

2726
02:24:12,750 --> 02:24:12,970
What was in here?

2727
02:24:13,510 --> 02:24:14,010
Can't remember.

2728
02:24:22,840 --> 02:24:23,700
You've seen the reel.

2729
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:24,380
Yeah, I know.

2730
02:24:25,620 --> 02:24:25,980
But...

2731
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:28,000
I have to, like, look at it again.

2732
02:24:28,260 --> 02:24:28,980
Oh yeah, okay.

2733
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:30,760
Ah...

2734
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:33,440
I could go get it and look at it here.

2735
02:24:34,480 --> 02:24:35,540
Try and figure it out.

2736
02:24:36,400 --> 02:24:37,080
Let's just do that.

2737
02:24:40,060 --> 02:24:40,860
Is it this one?

2738
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:41,880
Wait, is it this reel?

2739
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:44,240
I don't think it is, right?

2740
02:24:44,420 --> 02:24:45,300
It's not this one, right?

2741
02:24:49,650 --> 02:24:51,550
This one just shows, um...

2742
02:24:52,290 --> 02:24:53,730
I think that one showed...

2743
02:24:55,430 --> 02:24:57,150
Okay, I think we need to look at the other one.

2744
02:25:00,190 --> 02:25:06,370
Because that one, if I remember correctly, it shows how to get into the secret room in here.

2745
02:25:07,570 --> 02:25:09,350
By getting rid of the lanterns.

2746
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:18,180
Yeah, that one showed the trick with the paintings.

2747
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:20,760
Yeah, so there's no point going back into there.

2748
02:25:23,140 --> 02:25:23,540
Um...

2749
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:24,760
Wow!

2750
02:25:27,020 --> 02:25:28,300
Okay, I'm surprised I made that.

2751
02:25:36,340 --> 02:25:38,300
I don't like the music in here at all.

2752
02:25:41,260 --> 02:25:42,520
I'm just like you guys!

2753
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:46,020
That means you should leave me alone!

2754
02:25:48,580 --> 02:25:50,320
That means you should leave me alone!

2755
02:25:53,360 --> 02:25:53,780
Hmm...

2756
02:25:54,260 --> 02:25:56,160
Oh, wake up.

2757
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:06,240
Let's see.

2758
02:26:11,740 --> 02:26:14,120
I can't fly around so much.

2759
02:26:17,180 --> 02:26:17,860
I can't fly around so much.

2760
02:26:17,860 --> 02:26:18,240
So...

2761
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:18,560
So...

2762
02:26:21,720 --> 02:26:24,460
I can't drop into the water probably.

2763
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:25,680
I can't drop into the water probably.

2764
02:26:27,220 --> 02:26:28,520
I don't see...

2765
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:28,820
I don't see...

2766
02:26:28,820 --> 02:26:29,160
Let's see.

2767
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:30,760
Maybe we can see from here.

2768
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:37,760
I don't see any like hidden...

2769
02:26:38,660 --> 02:26:39,720
Wait a minute...

2770
02:26:39,720 --> 02:26:39,940
Wait!

2771
02:26:43,700 --> 02:26:45,160
Wait just a darn second!

2772
02:26:47,460 --> 02:26:48,860
That one over there?

2773
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:50,040
That one over there?

2774
02:26:53,340 --> 02:26:54,860
How am I supposed to get there though?

2775
02:27:01,050 --> 02:27:01,530
Hmm...

2776
02:27:02,330 --> 02:27:03,510
You think I can jump?

2777
02:27:06,170 --> 02:27:07,670
You think I can make it if I jump?

2778
02:27:10,870 --> 02:27:13,450
There's no weird parkour needed except for one achievement.

2779
02:27:13,910 --> 02:27:13,990
There's no weird parkour needed except for one achievement.

2780
02:27:16,970 --> 02:27:18,410
One way to find out.

2781
02:27:19,290 --> 02:27:20,010
Oh gosh.

2782
02:27:23,150 --> 02:27:24,810
No, but those scrawny legs!

2783
02:27:27,250 --> 02:27:28,210
Do a double jump.

2784
02:27:28,250 --> 02:27:29,810
Yeah, I don't have a jetpack.

2785
02:27:35,550 --> 02:27:36,850
Do I have to...

2786
02:27:41,070 --> 02:27:44,890
I don't think if I get it over there, I won't be able to jump up onto the...

2787
02:27:44,890 --> 02:27:46,990
I don't know how to pull myself up, you know?

2788
02:27:48,550 --> 02:27:48,910
I...

2789
02:27:48,910 --> 02:27:50,270
I am so sad.

2790
02:27:53,430 --> 02:27:55,170
I don't know how to use my arms.

2791
02:27:55,230 --> 02:27:56,670
Except for holding things apparently.

2792
02:27:59,990 --> 02:28:00,410
Okay.

2793
02:28:02,430 --> 02:28:02,850
Maybe...

2794
02:28:06,210 --> 02:28:06,990
There's a staircase.

2795
02:28:09,470 --> 02:28:10,750
Let's explore a little bit more.

2796
02:28:10,890 --> 02:28:12,150
Wait, this is where...

2797
02:28:12,890 --> 02:28:14,990
Isn't it in there where the guy is walking around?

2798
02:28:20,270 --> 02:28:21,170
Or am I crazy?

2799
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:23,230
Let's go the other way then.

2800
02:28:29,110 --> 02:28:32,410
If there's someone walking around on the other side, we'll just...

2801
02:28:33,510 --> 02:28:34,870
go this way then.

2802
02:28:35,810 --> 02:28:36,590
There's an elevator.

2803
02:28:38,710 --> 02:28:39,990
I want to get down there too.

2804
02:28:42,870 --> 02:28:44,770
Time to explore just a little bit.

2805
02:28:45,770 --> 02:28:46,690
Even though I'm terrified.

2806
02:29:43,340 --> 02:29:44,580
I don't like it.

2807
02:29:44,660 --> 02:29:45,200
I don't like it.

2808
02:29:49,320 --> 02:29:50,060
Wait a second!

2809
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:50,440
Wait a second!

2810
02:29:50,440 --> 02:29:51,320
Can I make it?

2811
02:29:52,100 --> 02:29:52,680
Dang it.

2812
02:29:56,100 --> 02:29:57,100
Where am I?

2813
02:29:58,260 --> 02:29:58,700
Oh.

2814
02:30:02,060 --> 02:30:02,640
Oh gosh.

2815
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:05,340
There we go.

2816
02:30:07,280 --> 02:30:08,160
Good morning.

2817
02:30:08,400 --> 02:30:09,500
Good morning.

2818
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:15,320
Okay, we'll have to watch the thing again.

2819
02:30:17,140 --> 02:30:18,960
You can't make it.

2820
02:30:21,340 --> 02:30:21,980
Sorry.

2821
02:30:22,140 --> 02:30:24,580
No music this time.

2822
02:30:37,660 --> 02:30:40,300
But even if I do make it at that point...

2823
02:30:44,020 --> 02:30:45,780
There's actually a couple seconds...

2824
02:30:45,780 --> 02:30:46,480
before...

2825
02:30:47,740 --> 02:30:49,340
There's like a little bit...

2826
02:30:49,340 --> 02:30:51,060
before we pass away.

2827
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:54,560
Maybe...

2828
02:30:58,440 --> 02:31:00,720
Before the loop consumes us?

2829
02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:03,100
Before the loop consumes us?

2830
02:31:03,440 --> 02:31:04,080
Hm.

2831
02:31:09,220 --> 02:31:09,980
Hm.

2832
02:31:15,490 --> 02:31:17,210
Which one was it?

2833
02:31:21,690 --> 02:31:22,450
No.

2834
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:27,040
No.

2835
02:31:28,780 --> 02:31:29,120
No.

2836
02:31:41,950 --> 02:31:42,330
No.

2837
02:31:43,070 --> 02:31:43,830
Sss.

2838
02:31:44,330 --> 02:31:45,090
Sssssssssss.

2839
02:31:50,010 --> 02:31:52,350
Was it this one?

2840
02:31:52,850 --> 02:31:53,530
No...

2841
02:31:54,190 --> 02:31:56,070
No...

2842
02:31:56,070 --> 02:31:58,250
No...

2843
02:31:58,250 --> 02:31:59,650
No...

2844
02:32:01,490 --> 02:32:02,190
No...

2845
02:32:07,420 --> 02:32:08,780
No...

2846
02:32:08,780 --> 02:32:09,760
No...

2847
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:11,280
Where is it?

2848
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:13,580
Uh oh...

2849
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:17,780
Where is my vision?

2850
02:32:21,220 --> 02:32:22,200
It's not this one, right?

2851
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:24,640
No...

2852
02:32:25,140 --> 02:32:26,320
Did you see it?

2853
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:27,680
Wait, huh?

2854
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:30,340
Where is the thing?

2855
02:32:34,100 --> 02:32:35,280
Is it on a line?

2856
02:32:35,460 --> 02:32:35,800
Oh, maybe.

2857
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,400
Unless it's at the end of this one, is what I'm checking too.

2858
02:32:40,120 --> 02:32:42,080
Let's see if it...

2859
02:32:42,080 --> 02:32:43,480
Okay, there's loops.

2860
02:32:43,780 --> 02:32:44,640
Oh, the hidden vault?

2861
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:46,640
Yeah, yeah.

2862
02:32:48,300 --> 02:32:50,140
Ah, okay.

2863
02:32:53,080 --> 02:32:54,000
Hello.

2864
02:32:55,300 --> 02:32:56,820
Points to tower.

2865
02:32:57,540 --> 02:32:59,440
Go up the tower.

2866
02:33:03,360 --> 02:33:04,280
Hello.

2867
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:05,200
Point...

2868
02:33:08,420 --> 02:33:09,340
Artifact.

2869
02:33:10,620 --> 02:33:12,020
Back downstairs.

2870
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:16,920
In here.

2871
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:17,980
Snooze.

2872
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:20,780
Wake back up.

2873
02:33:27,400 --> 02:33:28,880
Those two turn off.

2874
02:33:30,340 --> 02:33:31,560
Then we can enter.

2875
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:31,940
Huh?

2876
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:44,660
Oh, oops.

2877
02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:45,120
My bad.

2878
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:46,780
Yeah!

2879
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:50,700
That's what I did though, but...

2880
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:56,200
He doesn't show back up with the artifact.

2881
02:33:57,600 --> 02:33:58,820
Like I thought he did.

2882
02:33:59,900 --> 02:34:00,960
Ikea directions.

2883
02:34:01,360 --> 02:34:01,680
Hahaha.

2884
02:34:08,480 --> 02:34:09,980
Maybe it's missing something.

2885
02:34:13,260 --> 02:34:13,700
Maybe.

2886
02:34:13,900 --> 02:34:15,980
Is it okay if I go to the little ghostly's room real quick?

2887
02:34:16,140 --> 02:34:17,500
You guys just keep watching this.

2888
02:34:18,260 --> 02:34:22,060
And I'm gonna go to the bathroom and I'm also gonna grab a little bit of a snack.

2889
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:24,280
Because my tummy is hungry.

2890
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:26,400
So give me one second.

2891
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:26,860
Here.

2892
02:34:29,820 --> 02:34:30,260
Uh...

2893
02:34:32,700 --> 02:34:33,620
I'll be right back.

2894
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:34,520
Hahaha.

2895
02:34:34,520 --> 02:34:35,820
I'll be right back.

2896
02:34:35,860 --> 02:34:37,420
Give me like five minutes maybe.

2897
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:39,860
Sorry, sorry.

2898
02:34:40,060 --> 02:34:40,600
I'll be right back.

2899
02:41:12,280 --> 02:41:12,980
I'm back.

2900
02:41:13,860 --> 02:41:16,840
I have pies with me because she was really sad.

2901
02:41:18,340 --> 02:41:19,700
I have her with me.

2902
02:41:20,140 --> 02:41:20,620
Right?

2903
02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:22,080
Yeah.

2904
02:41:22,580 --> 02:41:24,920
You wanted in here so badly.

2905
02:41:25,940 --> 02:41:26,940
You're a banana.

2906
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:29,160
Welcome back.

2907
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:29,820
Thank you!

2908
02:41:32,440 --> 02:41:32,920
Okay.

2909
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:35,220
I have a snack.

2910
02:41:39,380 --> 02:41:42,620
Butter shoyu stick potato.

2911
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,250
Butter shoyu stick potato.

2912
02:41:54,190 --> 02:41:56,070
I'll have some actual dinner afterwards.

2913
02:41:57,370 --> 02:41:58,030
Yeah.

2914
02:41:59,130 --> 02:42:03,300
And I have my gamer chopsticks.

2915
02:42:13,980 --> 02:42:15,520
Have we figured anything out?

2916
02:42:16,980 --> 02:42:19,500
You guys said watch it real closely.

2917
02:42:21,080 --> 02:42:22,280
And um...

2918
02:42:23,700 --> 02:42:24,300
Yep.

2919
02:42:25,300 --> 02:42:25,900
Hahaha.

2920
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:28,700
Um...

2921
02:42:29,640 --> 02:42:32,300
Do I have to stand in like that corner of the room?

2922
02:42:42,790 --> 02:42:44,290
It's giving me visions.

2923
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:50,840
Mm...

2924
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:51,960
Yum yum yum yum yum.

2925
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:53,880
I'm

2926
02:43:02,070 --> 02:43:02,650
looking.

2927
02:43:11,150 --> 02:43:11,970
What are you looking for?

2928
02:43:11,970 --> 02:43:12,210
What are you doing?

2929
02:43:13,690 --> 02:43:14,530
Stop it!

2930
02:43:15,290 --> 02:43:15,810
Stop!

2931
02:43:15,830 --> 02:43:19,070
Stop, don't... oh my god.

2932
02:43:20,310 --> 02:43:21,730
She knocked the...

2933
02:43:23,730 --> 02:43:25,210
The top of... oh my god.

2934
02:43:26,190 --> 02:43:27,690
Stop it, you bad girl.

2935
02:43:28,510 --> 02:43:29,170
Stop it.

2936
02:43:32,650 --> 02:43:34,990
She might get into some stuff, so...

2937
02:43:34,990 --> 02:43:36,450
You wanna lay in my chair?

2938
02:43:37,230 --> 02:43:41,610
You wanna go plop over there?

2939
02:43:41,610 --> 02:43:43,430
Are you gonna plop?

2940
02:43:43,630 --> 02:43:44,750
She plopped.

2941
02:43:47,280 --> 02:43:55,370
I tore off the corner of the bag and she knocked it off and started like...

2942
02:43:55,370 --> 02:43:56,250
licking it.

2943
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:03,780
I don't know what to do here.

2944
02:44:07,660 --> 02:44:09,860
I have no idea.

2945
02:44:17,580 --> 02:44:17,940
Oh!

2946
02:44:18,280 --> 02:44:19,700
I had to turn off my fishing.

2947
02:44:20,540 --> 02:44:21,200
Sorry, my bad.

2948
02:44:26,120 --> 02:44:27,220
I have no idea.

2949
02:44:28,420 --> 02:44:29,040
I'm stuck.

2950
02:44:29,220 --> 02:44:29,840
I'm a little stuck.

2951
02:44:35,950 --> 02:44:38,210
I can explore and then come back to the puzzle?

2952
02:44:38,750 --> 02:44:41,630
Yeah, but that means I have to go into scary areas again.

2953
02:44:42,690 --> 02:44:44,130
I don't know if I wanna do that.

2954
02:44:52,070 --> 02:44:52,410
And roll.

2955
02:44:57,050 --> 02:44:57,830
Perfection.

2956
02:45:05,750 --> 02:45:08,350
You cannot avoid the scary.

2957
02:45:14,370 --> 02:45:16,210
Are you sure?

2958
02:45:16,810 --> 02:45:17,950
Welcome back, boss.

2959
02:45:18,090 --> 02:45:18,730
Thank you.

2960
02:45:18,730 --> 02:45:18,790
Thank you.

2961
02:45:22,870 --> 02:45:25,010
I always am just a little bit off.

2962
02:45:29,710 --> 02:45:30,210
Alright.

2963
02:45:30,290 --> 02:45:31,330
What's a scary area?

2964
02:45:34,970 --> 02:45:36,370
Oh, my ship.

2965
02:45:37,370 --> 02:45:38,610
Okay, hold on.

2966
02:45:39,610 --> 02:45:40,810
I didn't even notice that.

2967
02:45:40,950 --> 02:45:43,610
What the?

2968
02:45:47,620 --> 02:45:48,300
Hold on.

2969
02:45:52,410 --> 02:45:52,910
Oh.

2970
02:45:52,910 --> 02:45:54,330
Orlando, Idaho.

2971
02:45:54,530 --> 02:45:55,390
What are you talking about?

2972
02:45:59,130 --> 02:45:59,610
Okay.

2973
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:03,620
Ship log.

2974
02:46:04,720 --> 02:46:05,340
Let's see.

2975
02:46:08,060 --> 02:46:08,920
Endless Canyon.

2976
02:46:11,560 --> 02:46:12,960
Candlelit Lodge is built.

2977
02:46:13,080 --> 02:46:14,400
Okay, that was...

2978
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:17,180
I have to remember how to get to these places.

2979
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:20,400
I have to remember how to...

2980
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:23,240
You can explore the one cave with the ghost matter again.

2981
02:46:25,320 --> 02:46:26,040
Oh, yeah.

2982
02:46:28,180 --> 02:46:28,920
I can.

2983
02:46:29,800 --> 02:46:31,060
Do that place.

2984
02:46:31,900 --> 02:46:32,380
Risotto.

2985
02:46:32,440 --> 02:46:33,420
Thanks for two months.

2986
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:34,060
Thank you.

2987
02:46:35,320 --> 02:46:36,020
Oh, my god.

2988
02:46:36,040 --> 02:46:37,260
Pies is going kind of crazy.

2989
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:41,160
Starlit cave.

2990
02:46:45,560 --> 02:46:47,340
I don't remember which one is which.

2991
02:46:47,480 --> 02:46:49,340
I guess we have to explore all three of them.

2992
02:46:50,420 --> 02:46:53,340
I guess all of them have something going on.

2993
02:46:53,940 --> 02:46:54,420
I guess all of them have something going on.

2994
02:46:54,420 --> 02:47:02,930
The light coming out of the vault gave me a vision of climbing a spiral staircase to a room near the top of the tower.

2995
02:47:03,090 --> 02:47:11,750
One of the strangers inhabitants pointed at the mural beneath a ringed planet, then picked up an artifact and carried it downstairs to a room with a green fire.

2996
02:47:12,670 --> 02:47:17,910
Sometime later, two of the lamps in the mural room turned off, blending the mural into darkness and revealing a secret passage.

2997
02:47:21,630 --> 02:47:22,590
Do I have to like...

2998
02:47:22,590 --> 02:47:26,150
Is it so specific that I have to like put the artifact there and...

2999
02:47:26,150 --> 02:47:27,510
I don't know.

3000
02:47:39,170 --> 02:47:41,330
The lodge was the place with the hidden canyon?

3001
02:47:44,270 --> 02:47:45,570
I haven't been there.

3002
02:47:45,910 --> 02:47:46,370
Oh, yes.

3003
02:47:47,570 --> 02:47:48,050
Yes.

3004
02:47:48,050 --> 02:47:48,530
Yes.

3005
02:47:48,570 --> 02:47:51,130
We found out the way to get there through the hole.

3006
02:47:51,670 --> 02:47:52,350
That's right.

3007
02:47:52,450 --> 02:47:52,870
You're right.

3008
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,920
I recommend exploring the dark places for more info.

3009
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:03,840
I recommend exploring the dark places for more info.

3010
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:03,880
Okay.

3011
02:48:08,520 --> 02:48:08,960
Okay.

3012
02:48:11,540 --> 02:48:13,200
We'll just go to the first one then.

3013
02:48:15,340 --> 02:48:16,700
We'll just go to the one...

3014
02:48:17,340 --> 02:48:18,440
right here at the very beginning.

3015
02:48:38,100 --> 02:48:40,180
I feel like I'm not going to sleep tonight.

3016
02:48:45,940 --> 02:48:47,520
We'll go to this one here.

3017
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:50,780
Damn this whimsy music.

3018
02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:53,700
Screw you.

3019
02:49:18,090 --> 02:49:18,770
Grab.

3020
02:49:18,770 --> 02:49:19,810
Grab and go.

3021
02:49:21,170 --> 02:49:21,850
Speedrun.

3022
02:49:24,250 --> 02:49:25,690
Sending my energy.

3023
02:49:27,570 --> 02:49:28,430
Thank you.

3024
02:49:28,630 --> 02:49:29,830
I need it.

3025
02:49:32,030 --> 02:49:33,610
I'm wobbling it up.

3026
02:49:34,670 --> 02:49:35,790
I'm a hungry ghost.

3027
02:49:36,670 --> 02:49:37,150
Okay.

3028
02:49:37,210 --> 02:49:38,890
We'll just go here first.

3029
02:49:50,870 --> 02:49:53,070
So maybe if they see me...

3030
02:49:53,550 --> 02:49:55,010
They just wake me up.

3031
02:49:55,070 --> 02:49:55,390
Maybe.

3032
02:49:58,450 --> 02:49:58,930
Right.

3033
02:49:59,170 --> 02:50:01,350
You guys aren't going to do anything bad to me.

3034
02:50:01,390 --> 02:50:01,550
Right?

3035
02:50:02,030 --> 02:50:03,250
Just going to wake me up.

3036
02:50:03,790 --> 02:50:05,370
Bet you wish you touched fish.

3037
02:50:09,670 --> 02:50:10,630
Shut up.

3038
02:50:10,710 --> 02:50:11,010
Shut up.

3039
02:50:13,530 --> 02:50:14,250
Okay.

3040
02:50:14,930 --> 02:50:16,590
We're back in a place.

3041
02:50:23,670 --> 02:50:25,070
Is this the DLC version?

3042
02:50:25,350 --> 02:50:25,790
It is.

3043
02:50:27,510 --> 02:50:30,030
This is Outer Wilds DLC.

3044
02:50:30,790 --> 02:50:32,350
It's very scary.

3045
02:50:38,500 --> 02:50:39,220
Yeah.

3046
02:50:39,220 --> 02:50:40,300
There's this door here.

3047
02:50:41,660 --> 02:50:42,260
Somebody's house.

3048
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:44,560
Oh yes.

3049
02:50:44,600 --> 02:50:47,220
This is where this person just gazes.

3050
02:50:52,690 --> 02:50:53,890
Into the...

3051
02:50:54,950 --> 02:50:55,750
Yup.

3052
02:50:56,250 --> 02:50:56,650
Yup.

3053
02:50:58,230 --> 02:51:00,930
Totally normal noise is happening right now.

3054
02:51:03,370 --> 02:51:05,070
Everything is pretty normal.

3055
02:51:09,320 --> 02:51:10,780
Wake me up.

3056
02:51:10,840 --> 02:51:12,480
Wake me up and...

3057
02:51:13,320 --> 02:51:14,980
I can't wake up.

3058
02:51:15,380 --> 02:51:18,320
Wake me up and save me.

3059
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:22,540
Huh.

3060
02:51:22,840 --> 02:51:23,220
Wait.

3061
02:51:23,500 --> 02:51:24,040
Extinguish.

3062
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:27,120
Oh.

3063
02:51:28,760 --> 02:51:29,300
Interesting.

3064
02:51:29,900 --> 02:51:31,660
What happens if I go there now?

3065
02:51:36,950 --> 02:51:38,110
Is the door open?

3066
02:51:42,790 --> 02:51:43,870
Oh god.

3067
02:51:46,030 --> 02:51:47,290
I'm just a maid.

3068
02:51:53,790 --> 02:51:54,830
I'm just a maid.

3069
02:51:54,870 --> 02:51:55,990
I'm here to clean your room.

3070
02:51:56,050 --> 02:51:56,230
Help!

3071
02:52:01,020 --> 02:52:02,660
Nothing more, nothing less.

3072
02:52:04,200 --> 02:52:06,020
Just regular maid...

3073
02:52:06,020 --> 02:52:07,960
maid activities.

3074
02:52:08,320 --> 02:52:09,200
Of course.

3075
02:52:12,850 --> 02:52:14,190
What the hell is that?

3076
02:52:15,930 --> 02:52:16,770
Oh.

3077
02:52:18,830 --> 02:52:19,670
Hello.

3078
02:52:34,910 --> 02:52:36,450
Let's go really quickly.

3079
02:52:41,270 --> 02:52:43,550
My controller is vibrating.

3080
02:53:09,100 --> 02:53:11,200
Wait, isn't that the tower I need to go to?

3081
02:53:22,540 --> 02:53:23,420
They're idols.

3082
02:53:23,760 --> 02:53:24,600
Yeah, they were singing.

3083
02:53:26,900 --> 02:53:27,340
Tiger.

3084
02:53:27,580 --> 02:53:27,860
Fire.

3085
02:53:28,280 --> 02:53:28,720
Cyber.

3086
02:53:29,540 --> 02:53:29,980
Fiber.

3087
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:30,280
Diver.

3088
02:53:30,380 --> 02:53:30,600
Viber.

3089
02:53:30,680 --> 02:53:31,000
Jar Jar.

3090
02:53:33,580 --> 02:53:34,020
Look,

3091
02:53:38,160 --> 02:53:38,860
I'm a I'm a fan.

3092
02:53:39,080 --> 02:53:40,160
I'm a big fan of you guys.

3093
02:53:43,180 --> 02:53:44,060
Huge fan.

3094
02:53:46,740 --> 02:53:48,000
That's... yeah, that's...

3095
02:53:50,160 --> 02:53:51,540
But it's not open.

3096
02:53:51,760 --> 02:53:52,940
Good thing we didn't go down there.

3097
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:55,240
Why are we going into another cave?

3098
02:54:10,490 --> 02:54:12,570
I'm just... I'm just taking...

3099
02:54:12,570 --> 02:54:15,350
Taking it easy.

3100
02:54:17,130 --> 02:54:19,170
Taking it easy.

3101
02:54:19,170 --> 02:54:19,950
Taking it easy.

3102
02:54:25,960 --> 02:54:26,540
Oh.

3103
02:54:26,720 --> 02:54:28,140
I think this is our stop.

3104
02:54:34,940 --> 02:54:35,520
Ah.

3105
02:54:39,360 --> 02:54:41,140
Taking it easy.

3106
02:54:42,980 --> 02:54:44,780
Taking it easy.

3107
02:54:45,340 --> 02:54:47,100
I want to see where this goes to.

3108
02:54:57,860 --> 02:55:00,380
I'm just seeing where it takes us, you guys.

3109
02:55:02,480 --> 02:55:03,420
Life is...

3110
02:55:03,640 --> 02:55:07,560
Sometimes about not the destination, but the journey.

3111
02:55:12,520 --> 02:55:13,600
What's this one?

3112
02:55:14,280 --> 02:55:14,760
Wait.

3113
02:55:16,740 --> 02:55:18,460
What is this?

3114
02:55:20,680 --> 02:55:21,400
Hmm.

3115
02:55:23,440 --> 02:55:24,520
I'm intrigued.

3116
02:55:25,080 --> 02:55:26,200
By the staircase.

3117
02:55:27,660 --> 02:55:28,380
Oh.

3118
02:55:28,500 --> 02:55:31,140
Look, we can even summon a new bow.

3119
02:55:31,280 --> 02:55:31,920
It's fine.

3120
02:55:47,440 --> 02:55:48,560
A rock.

3121
02:55:52,160 --> 02:55:53,140
Let's grabby grab.

3122
02:55:55,480 --> 02:55:56,000
Okay.

3123
02:55:56,060 --> 02:55:57,700
I think I gotta get grabbed by this guy.

3124
02:55:58,940 --> 02:55:59,460
Wew!

3125
02:56:01,160 --> 02:56:01,680
Okay.

3126
02:56:07,530 --> 02:56:13,150
This is where they all just sit and stare at what's going on in here.

3127
02:56:15,850 --> 02:56:17,430
Little creepy voyeurs.

3128
02:56:17,470 --> 02:56:18,110
That's what they are.

3129
02:56:18,970 --> 02:56:20,870
What do I... What's my vision?

3130
02:56:24,680 --> 02:56:25,200
Okay.

3131
02:56:26,020 --> 02:56:27,040
I'm gonna grab one too.

3132
02:56:34,640 --> 02:56:35,120
Okay.

3133
02:56:40,060 --> 02:56:40,820
I did that.

3134
02:56:54,810 --> 02:56:55,710
They took it.

3135
02:57:00,420 --> 02:57:00,900
Okay.

3136
02:57:04,710 --> 02:57:05,510
What's it mean?

3137
02:57:07,550 --> 02:57:08,830
So this is where...

3138
02:57:09,490 --> 02:57:14,090
Yes, this is where I would respawn.

3139
02:57:14,410 --> 02:57:15,250
Yes, yes, yes.

3140
02:57:15,830 --> 02:57:18,730
Or like when I go... when I do this part.

3141
02:57:19,030 --> 02:57:19,310
Okay.

3142
02:57:19,790 --> 02:57:21,370
Yeah, they were carrying something.

3143
02:57:30,730 --> 02:57:32,250
They took it downstairs.

3144
02:57:42,300 --> 02:57:45,260
It's interesting though because when I leave this...

3145
02:57:47,480 --> 02:57:49,200
I am not in this place.

3146
02:57:49,200 --> 02:57:49,980
Speedy fire!

3147
02:57:50,480 --> 02:57:51,480
Thanks for the farm gift!

3148
02:57:52,100 --> 02:57:52,920
Thank you!

3149
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:56,000
Huh.

3150
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,140
Oh yes, I went underground, right?

3151
02:58:06,320 --> 02:58:06,860
I went...

3152
02:58:06,860 --> 02:58:08,320
It was like the subterranean...

3153
02:58:08,320 --> 02:58:09,280
No, that's not the lake.

3154
02:58:09,720 --> 02:58:11,560
That's not the subterranean lake, is it?

3155
02:58:14,200 --> 02:58:15,480
Can I see it though?

3156
02:58:25,910 --> 02:58:26,390
Faster.

3157
02:58:26,390 --> 02:58:26,650
Faster.

3158
02:58:29,150 --> 02:58:31,510
Maybe we can go to that one platform I missed.

3159
02:58:34,190 --> 02:58:34,990
I'm scared.

3160
02:58:38,340 --> 02:58:39,460
This is...

3161
02:58:40,220 --> 02:58:40,880
a place!

3162
02:58:43,060 --> 02:58:44,360
Is this where...

3163
02:58:45,960 --> 02:58:46,940
we started?

3164
02:58:56,250 --> 02:58:57,190
I think so.

3165
02:59:00,430 --> 02:59:01,030
Yeah.

3166
02:59:02,610 --> 02:59:04,250
Yeah, this is where we started.

3167
02:59:05,850 --> 02:59:06,650
I'm not gonna stop.

3168
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:17,120
And we'll hear them singing again.

3169
02:59:17,780 --> 02:59:18,620
I think.

3170
02:59:22,140 --> 02:59:24,460
Doing their weird culty whatever.

3171
02:59:29,680 --> 02:59:31,520
Weird culty whatever going on in there.

3172
02:59:34,320 --> 02:59:34,920
Tiger!

3173
02:59:35,200 --> 02:59:35,660
Fire!

3174
02:59:35,960 --> 02:59:36,480
Cyber!

3175
02:59:36,840 --> 02:59:37,260
Fire!

3176
02:59:43,910 --> 02:59:45,450
Wait, did it mean to...

3177
02:59:51,640 --> 02:59:52,240
Wait.

3178
02:59:54,500 --> 02:59:55,540
Did it yell before?

3179
02:59:55,760 --> 02:59:56,500
I can't remember.

3180
02:59:58,800 --> 02:59:59,280
Huh.

3181
03:00:00,680 --> 03:00:01,660
Did it...

3182
03:00:03,040 --> 03:00:04,400
Did it yell before?

3183
03:00:04,640 --> 03:00:06,140
Did it do that scream before?

3184
03:00:13,790 --> 03:00:14,430
Huh.

3185
03:00:19,740 --> 03:00:20,380
Huh.

3186
03:00:25,670 --> 03:00:27,010
Maybe let's find a boat.

3187
03:00:31,390 --> 03:00:32,670
There's one down there.

3188
03:00:37,970 --> 03:00:40,670
Or maybe it saw me and then that's why it yelled.

3189
03:00:40,810 --> 03:00:40,930
Or maybe it saw me and then that's why it yelled.

3190
03:00:40,930 --> 03:00:41,950
I spooked it maybe.

3191
03:00:46,870 --> 03:00:47,550
A boat?

3192
03:00:48,030 --> 03:00:48,070
A boat?

3193
03:00:50,290 --> 03:00:51,370
Any boats around?

3194
03:00:51,890 --> 03:00:51,910
Any boats around?

3195
03:00:52,990 --> 03:00:55,190
I feel like we were in there for such a long time.

3196
03:00:55,450 --> 03:00:55,470
I feel like we were in there for such a long time.

3197
03:00:56,430 --> 03:00:56,870
Before...

3198
03:00:58,110 --> 03:00:59,410
Before the dam broke.

3199
03:01:04,090 --> 03:01:05,230
Ah, an alien!

3200
03:01:05,710 --> 03:01:06,530
Says the alien.

3201
03:01:07,350 --> 03:01:08,870
No, they say... Ah, ghost!

3202
03:01:09,110 --> 03:01:09,270
I'm stuck.

3203
03:01:11,270 --> 03:01:13,330
I'm just waiting for this boat to come on by.

3204
03:01:29,020 --> 03:01:29,460
Boat?

3205
03:01:30,260 --> 03:01:31,320
Where the hell did it go?

3206
03:01:33,780 --> 03:01:34,620
Is it stuck?

3207
03:01:37,580 --> 03:01:39,240
Maybe this helps push it.

3208
03:01:41,480 --> 03:01:41,920
Hello!

3209
03:01:47,200 --> 03:01:48,520
This is so like...

3210
03:01:49,260 --> 03:01:50,740
Oh my god, there's the boat!

3211
03:01:50,960 --> 03:01:51,900
Are you kidding me?

3212
03:01:51,900 --> 03:01:52,460
Hahaha!

3213
03:01:54,460 --> 03:01:55,920
It's upside down!

3214
03:01:58,680 --> 03:02:00,080
Ah, this is fine.

3215
03:02:00,340 --> 03:02:01,200
We'll just ride this.

3216
03:02:03,100 --> 03:02:04,040
Here we go.

3217
03:02:09,800 --> 03:02:10,720
There we go.

3218
03:02:11,780 --> 03:02:13,020
Even better.

3219
03:02:13,900 --> 03:02:14,520
Um...

3220
03:02:14,520 --> 03:02:16,840
This reminds me of when like I took the...

3221
03:02:16,840 --> 03:02:17,960
You know, the river...

3222
03:02:17,960 --> 03:02:19,260
The river Styx.

3223
03:02:20,960 --> 03:02:21,980
Sanzu no Kawa.

3224
03:02:23,750 --> 03:02:24,480
Good times.

3225
03:02:35,670 --> 03:02:36,290
Okay.

3226
03:02:36,290 --> 03:02:36,910
Nice.

3227
03:02:40,050 --> 03:02:40,670
Yeah!

3228
03:02:45,990 --> 03:02:46,610
And...

3229
03:02:47,530 --> 03:02:48,150
Nice.

3230
03:02:54,930 --> 03:02:56,870
Time to go back into the creepy world.

3231
03:02:57,210 --> 03:02:58,790
But I liked being on the boat.

3232
03:02:58,790 --> 03:03:00,170
I felt pretty safe there.

3233
03:03:00,230 --> 03:03:00,810
Not gonna lie.

3234
03:03:02,570 --> 03:03:04,810
I didn't mind so much being on the boat.

3235
03:03:04,990 --> 03:03:05,110
Oops.

3236
03:03:05,230 --> 03:03:06,530
I always go the wrong direction.

3237
03:03:07,170 --> 03:03:08,490
I kinda liked it.

3238
03:03:08,630 --> 03:03:10,070
I kinda felt safe and...

3239
03:03:10,630 --> 03:03:12,170
Like it was kinda chill, you know?

3240
03:03:13,130 --> 03:03:13,870
Anyways, guys.

3241
03:03:15,950 --> 03:03:17,210
See you never, I hope.

3242
03:03:18,710 --> 03:03:20,210
See you never, I hope!

3243
03:03:24,660 --> 03:03:25,100
Oh.

3244
03:03:25,100 --> 03:03:25,820
Uh, here.

3245
03:03:37,490 --> 03:03:40,890
But this area has the guy walking around, doesn't it?

3246
03:03:42,530 --> 03:03:43,050
Yeah.

3247
03:03:43,110 --> 03:03:46,090
I think this is the area where he's walking around upstairs.

3248
03:03:47,850 --> 03:03:49,270
Where's the boat at?

3249
03:03:50,330 --> 03:03:51,430
Where's the boat?

3250
03:04:00,350 --> 03:04:02,190
Okay, there was some guy walking up there.

3251
03:04:02,770 --> 03:04:04,290
Someone walking up here too.

3252
03:04:05,030 --> 03:04:05,810
Pretty sure.

3253
03:04:37,380 --> 03:04:39,300
Will he see me if I walk out here?

3254
03:04:39,420 --> 03:04:39,920
I don't know.

3255
03:04:43,080 --> 03:04:43,600
I don't know.

3256
03:04:45,760 --> 03:04:46,840
There's no windows.

3257
03:04:47,080 --> 03:04:47,560
Maybe not.

3258
03:04:52,890 --> 03:04:54,770
I can get grabby-grabbed.

3259
03:04:55,650 --> 03:04:56,210
Or...

3260
03:04:56,870 --> 03:04:57,810
What's down here?

3261
03:05:00,470 --> 03:05:01,590
Oh god!

3262
03:05:03,630 --> 03:05:06,030
I didn't mean to get grabby-grabbed!

3263
03:05:06,130 --> 03:05:07,110
It really scared me.

3264
03:05:08,750 --> 03:05:10,370
Oh my god.

3265
03:05:13,230 --> 03:05:14,670
Wait, am I on the second floor now?

3266
03:05:20,720 --> 03:05:21,700
Wait, am I on the second floor now?

3267
03:05:21,720 --> 03:05:21,800
On the third floor?

3268
03:05:47,630 --> 03:05:51,350
But if I grabby-grab over there, I will not be grabby-grabbing back, because there's nothing here!

3269
03:05:53,250 --> 03:05:54,610
Let's go back to the other side.

3270
03:05:58,880 --> 03:06:00,780
Guys, this is too spooky for me.

3271
03:06:08,340 --> 03:06:08,740
Okay.

3272
03:06:10,580 --> 03:06:11,640
I wanted to go...

3273
03:06:11,640 --> 03:06:12,000
Oh wait.

3274
03:06:14,420 --> 03:06:15,660
I have to drop down.

3275
03:06:16,600 --> 03:06:18,080
If I drop down, will I...

3276
03:06:18,080 --> 03:06:18,500
Wait.

3277
03:06:18,620 --> 03:06:19,200
Oh, here we go.

3278
03:06:19,300 --> 03:06:20,700
I was gonna say, will I be okay?

3279
03:06:24,400 --> 03:06:26,100
I can't read!

3280
03:06:45,070 --> 03:06:45,810
Wee woo!

3281
03:06:46,190 --> 03:06:46,530
Wee woo!

3282
03:06:47,950 --> 03:06:48,590
Well...

3283
03:06:53,680 --> 03:06:54,320
That...

3284
03:06:54,320 --> 03:06:55,280
Now we know.

3285
03:06:57,660 --> 03:06:58,300
Maybe...

3286
03:06:58,300 --> 03:07:01,280
I have to go through there without any light.

3287
03:07:02,120 --> 03:07:03,080
I think.

3288
03:07:11,450 --> 03:07:13,330
She got out without dying.

3289
03:07:13,650 --> 03:07:14,290
Stop!

3290
03:07:14,450 --> 03:07:15,790
You guys are making me so scared!

3291
03:07:23,710 --> 03:07:24,870
I'm really so scared!

3292
03:07:38,820 --> 03:07:40,440
Well, let's just drop some.

3293
03:07:45,290 --> 03:07:47,610
You progress five meters each loop.

3294
03:07:47,850 --> 03:07:49,270
That doesn't seem very much.

3295
03:07:56,060 --> 03:07:59,040
I'm not really finding anything in the other world.

3296
03:07:59,540 --> 03:08:01,160
I mean, I'm trying.

3297
03:08:01,420 --> 03:08:02,560
I am looking around.

3298
03:08:03,280 --> 03:08:06,080
But I am not finding so much.

3299
03:08:06,300 --> 03:08:06,660
Oh, whoops.

3300
03:08:06,780 --> 03:08:08,440
That's totally not even related.

3301
03:08:11,380 --> 03:08:11,820
Hmm...

3302
03:08:14,020 --> 03:08:14,680
You're close.

3303
03:08:14,700 --> 03:08:15,680
You just need to figure something.

3304
03:08:15,940 --> 03:08:16,220
Okay.

3305
03:08:18,120 --> 03:08:20,480
Figuring out one thing at a time does help.

3306
03:08:22,900 --> 03:08:23,980
You found the boat.

3307
03:08:24,100 --> 03:08:25,700
Last loop in the area with the bell.

3308
03:08:25,760 --> 03:08:26,120
This one.

3309
03:08:27,840 --> 03:08:28,280
True.

3310
03:08:29,980 --> 03:08:31,560
How did I get to the boat?

3311
03:08:34,220 --> 03:08:34,800
Oh, wait.

3312
03:08:34,860 --> 03:08:35,360
No, I remember.

3313
03:08:35,500 --> 03:08:37,240
That was just the normal path that we took.

3314
03:08:37,360 --> 03:08:38,260
Let's just go back there.

3315
03:08:38,500 --> 03:08:40,320
The boat kind of leads us to everywhere.

3316
03:08:40,560 --> 03:08:43,380
It seems pretty nice, actually.

3317
03:08:44,880 --> 03:08:47,020
And I know you guys are trying to scare me.

3318
03:08:47,080 --> 03:08:49,920
You guys are like, She doesn't know about the boat.

3319
03:08:51,180 --> 03:08:52,360
She doesn't know.

3320
03:08:53,060 --> 03:08:53,500
Well...

3321
03:08:56,040 --> 03:08:56,480
Um...

3322
03:09:00,450 --> 03:09:00,890
Whatever.

3323
03:09:02,850 --> 03:09:03,870
She doesn't know.

3324
03:09:03,890 --> 03:09:04,050
No.

3325
03:09:04,790 --> 03:09:06,550
She doesn't know the boat.

3326
03:09:08,810 --> 03:09:10,290
But we can go back to the bell.

3327
03:09:11,610 --> 03:09:12,570
Or rather...

3328
03:09:12,570 --> 03:09:13,050
Wait.

3329
03:09:13,250 --> 03:09:15,310
We're trying to figure out the bell on...

3330
03:09:17,670 --> 03:09:18,630
On, uh...

3331
03:09:19,690 --> 03:09:21,070
From the outside, right?

3332
03:09:21,310 --> 03:09:21,630
Or...

3333
03:09:21,630 --> 03:09:22,430
Oh my goodness.

3334
03:09:22,990 --> 03:09:24,250
I'm forgetting how to play.

3335
03:09:24,370 --> 03:09:25,250
I'm forgetting how to drive!

3336
03:09:27,490 --> 03:09:28,210
Matching velocity.

3337
03:09:29,190 --> 03:09:30,330
And doing a roll.

3338
03:09:36,560 --> 03:09:37,040
Perfect.

3339
03:09:38,520 --> 03:09:40,160
Don't forget my suit!

3340
03:09:43,360 --> 03:09:43,840
Alright,

3341
03:09:58,700 --> 03:09:59,020
let's...

3342
03:09:59,020 --> 03:10:01,640
I'm getting kind of good at speedrunning this, I think.

3343
03:10:05,220 --> 03:10:06,780
Getting a little good at it.

3344
03:10:06,920 --> 03:10:08,080
Getting a little good at it.

3345
03:10:15,880 --> 03:10:18,220
And I've always been good at driving this boat.

3346
03:10:18,960 --> 03:10:19,440
Okay.

3347
03:10:29,630 --> 03:10:30,930
Let's grab our artifact.

3348
03:10:37,030 --> 03:10:37,990
And let's...

3349
03:10:38,190 --> 03:10:39,930
Oh!

3350
03:10:40,750 --> 03:10:41,750
Whoopsie.

3351
03:10:42,370 --> 03:10:43,370
Let's...

3352
03:10:43,370 --> 03:10:45,350
Let's fly up.

3353
03:10:45,950 --> 03:10:47,230
Let's grab our...

3354
03:10:47,230 --> 03:10:49,190
Our artifact.

3355
03:10:51,170 --> 03:10:52,170
And...

3356
03:10:52,170 --> 03:10:52,390
Drop.

3357
03:10:52,710 --> 03:10:53,670
Okay.

3358
03:10:55,420 --> 03:10:56,360
Okay.

3359
03:10:56,760 --> 03:10:56,900
Okay.

3360
03:10:56,900 --> 03:10:57,340
Okay.

3361
03:10:57,340 --> 03:10:57,720
Okay.

3362
03:10:57,720 --> 03:10:58,260
Okay.

3363
03:10:58,260 --> 03:10:58,760
Okay.

3364
03:10:58,760 --> 03:10:59,360
Okay.

3365
03:10:59,440 --> 03:10:59,840
Okay.

3366
03:11:07,690 --> 03:11:08,190
Okay.

3367
03:11:08,550 --> 03:11:08,550
Okay.

3368
03:11:08,550 --> 03:11:08,550
Okay.

3369
03:11:09,630 --> 03:11:10,130
This

3370
03:11:16,780 --> 03:11:17,780
is...

3371
03:11:17,780 --> 03:11:18,980
The boat.

3372
03:11:19,660 --> 03:11:21,020
Actually, hold on.

3373
03:11:22,760 --> 03:11:23,060
Nevermind.

3374
03:11:23,360 --> 03:11:26,800
I was gonna say, does the picture represent where I'm going?

3375
03:11:26,980 --> 03:11:27,920
But I don't think so.

3376
03:11:30,960 --> 03:11:31,440
Oh.

3377
03:11:31,940 --> 03:11:33,380
It's not dark enough.

3378
03:11:33,520 --> 03:11:33,900
There we go.

3379
03:11:48,390 --> 03:11:49,850
I should have eaten it.

3380
03:11:51,350 --> 03:11:53,030
I should have had it anyway.

3381
03:11:53,670 --> 03:11:54,630
Good morning!

3382
03:11:55,670 --> 03:11:56,150
Nobody.

3383
03:11:57,970 --> 03:11:58,930
Good boy.

3384
03:12:00,430 --> 03:12:01,110
I mean...

3385
03:12:01,110 --> 03:12:01,490
Oh boy.

3386
03:12:07,860 --> 03:12:10,200
I am not trying to call...

3387
03:12:10,200 --> 03:12:11,060
I am not trying to call...

3388
03:12:11,060 --> 03:12:12,520
The aliens a good boy.

3389
03:12:12,840 --> 03:12:13,020
The aliens a good boy.

3390
03:12:18,340 --> 03:12:19,900
That was a mistake.

3391
03:12:41,100 --> 03:12:41,700
Meow.

3392
03:12:44,680 --> 03:12:47,660
I wish they would pre-put that line back into...

3393
03:12:47,660 --> 03:12:48,060
I wish they would pre-put that line back into...

3394
03:12:49,580 --> 03:12:50,180
Sonic.

3395
03:12:50,180 --> 03:12:50,400
Sonic.

3396
03:12:54,700 --> 03:12:55,220
Uh...

3397
03:12:55,220 --> 03:12:56,160
Meow.

3398
03:13:02,260 --> 03:13:02,780
Alright.

3399
03:13:02,860 --> 03:13:03,400
Come on, boat.

3400
03:13:07,790 --> 03:13:08,550
What is that?

3401
03:13:18,630 --> 03:13:19,150
There's...

3402
03:13:20,450 --> 03:13:21,550
Someone over there.

3403
03:13:30,550 --> 03:13:31,850
Or was that my...

3404
03:13:31,850 --> 03:13:33,290
That wasn't my cursor, was it?

3405
03:13:35,690 --> 03:13:36,210
Wait.

3406
03:13:36,770 --> 03:13:39,430
Was that the little dot in the middle?

3407
03:13:41,890 --> 03:13:43,030
Was that the little dot in the middle?

3408
03:13:44,410 --> 03:13:44,810
Wait.

3409
03:13:46,030 --> 03:13:46,830
Was that...

3410
03:13:49,070 --> 03:13:49,790
Was that the...

3411
03:13:51,430 --> 03:13:52,230
Was that the...

3412
03:13:52,230 --> 03:13:52,930
It was something, right?

3413
03:13:55,070 --> 03:13:55,670
There it is.

3414
03:13:55,750 --> 03:13:55,950
Yeah.

3415
03:13:56,110 --> 03:13:57,050
It's not my dot at all.

3416
03:14:01,650 --> 03:14:02,290
It is.

3417
03:14:02,310 --> 03:14:02,650
It is.

3418
03:14:02,650 --> 03:14:03,250
It was walking.

3419
03:14:03,350 --> 03:14:03,750
It was walking.

3420
03:14:03,810 --> 03:14:04,310
I saw it.

3421
03:14:13,490 --> 03:14:14,970
It wasn't me going crazy.

3422
03:14:19,670 --> 03:14:21,970
So there is something walking around in here.

3423
03:14:22,450 --> 03:14:22,850
So there is something walking around in here.

3424
03:14:24,230 --> 03:14:24,950
Oh.

3425
03:14:25,910 --> 03:14:26,630
No.

3426
03:14:26,890 --> 03:14:27,330
No.

3427
03:14:27,490 --> 03:14:27,890
No.

3428
03:14:27,910 --> 03:14:28,610
No.

3429
03:14:28,790 --> 03:14:29,270
No.

3430
03:14:29,270 --> 03:14:29,770
No.

3431
03:14:29,770 --> 03:14:30,250
No.

3432
03:14:30,250 --> 03:14:30,610
No.

3433
03:14:30,610 --> 03:14:30,970
No.

3434
03:14:30,970 --> 03:14:31,110
No.

3435
03:14:33,090 --> 03:14:34,530
Oh, golly.

3436
03:14:50,530 --> 03:14:51,690
Taking it slow.

3437
03:14:52,030 --> 03:14:52,050
Taking it slow.

3438
03:14:58,840 --> 03:15:00,180
Anywhere to get off?

3439
03:15:00,400 --> 03:15:01,120
Or...

3440
03:15:02,800 --> 03:15:03,520
No?

3441
03:15:04,560 --> 03:15:05,280
Nowhere...

3442
03:15:06,780 --> 03:15:08,400
My controller just...

3443
03:15:08,400 --> 03:15:09,060
vibrated.

3444
03:15:15,420 --> 03:15:16,420
Nowhere to get off.

3445
03:15:16,980 --> 03:15:17,460
Okay.

3446
03:15:19,400 --> 03:15:21,420
Oh, gosh.

3447
03:15:22,140 --> 03:15:23,200
Act like you belong.

3448
03:15:25,480 --> 03:15:25,960
Yeah.

3449
03:15:29,560 --> 03:15:30,560
Oh, this one.

3450
03:15:30,700 --> 03:15:32,100
This one I wanted to get off...

3451
03:15:32,100 --> 03:15:33,060
on before too.

3452
03:15:42,400 --> 03:15:43,600
Let's see what happens here.

3453
03:15:46,940 --> 03:15:48,040
I think just another...

3454
03:15:48,660 --> 03:15:49,820
I think this will call...

3455
03:15:49,820 --> 03:15:51,140
probably just another boat, right?

3456
03:15:51,320 --> 03:15:51,760
But...

3457
03:15:53,860 --> 03:15:54,400
What?

3458
03:15:58,050 --> 03:15:59,830
There's also an elevator here.

3459
03:16:06,390 --> 03:16:06,750
Hi!

3460
03:16:10,340 --> 03:16:11,940
Just calls another boat.

3461
03:16:12,480 --> 03:16:13,200
Okay.

3462
03:16:13,980 --> 03:16:15,140
That's what I figured.

3463
03:16:17,480 --> 03:16:18,200
So...

3464
03:16:18,200 --> 03:16:19,540
Basically...

3465
03:16:19,540 --> 03:16:22,260
We will come down from up there...

3466
03:16:22,260 --> 03:16:23,380
at some point.

3467
03:16:24,240 --> 03:16:24,960
Okay.

3468
03:16:29,260 --> 03:16:30,420
Ms. Frizzle...

3469
03:16:30,420 --> 03:16:31,880
I don't like this field trip.

3470
03:16:33,280 --> 03:16:34,640
I don't like it.

3471
03:16:34,640 --> 03:16:37,840
This game is so scary.

3472
03:16:38,220 --> 03:16:38,900
This game is so scary.

3473
03:16:38,900 --> 03:16:39,740
It's so dark.

3474
03:16:40,880 --> 03:16:42,840
And I even turned the brightness up.

3475
03:16:46,670 --> 03:16:47,750
So here.

3476
03:16:49,270 --> 03:16:50,610
This secret.

3477
03:16:51,010 --> 03:16:51,190
This secret.

3478
03:16:51,730 --> 03:16:53,710
They carried that thing down.

3479
03:16:59,700 --> 03:17:01,300
There's no one here though, right?

3480
03:17:02,540 --> 03:17:03,220
There's no one here though, right?

3481
03:17:03,840 --> 03:17:04,520
Yeah.

3482
03:17:05,140 --> 03:17:06,520
There's no one here though, right?

3483
03:17:10,960 --> 03:17:11,680
I think.

3484
03:17:23,990 --> 03:17:25,670
This calls another boat, right?

3485
03:17:26,490 --> 03:17:27,010
Yeah.

3486
03:17:27,010 --> 03:17:27,290
Okay.

3487
03:17:31,900 --> 03:17:32,420
Hmm.

3488
03:17:35,140 --> 03:17:37,500
I like how the chains go into non-existence.

3489
03:17:37,580 --> 03:17:37,960
I like that.

3490
03:17:38,020 --> 03:17:38,180
Yeah.

3491
03:17:38,260 --> 03:17:39,460
I noticed that earlier too.

3492
03:17:40,340 --> 03:17:41,520
It's just kind of...

3493
03:17:42,060 --> 03:17:42,780
You know.

3494
03:17:43,280 --> 03:17:45,080
It's by the power of...

3495
03:17:45,080 --> 03:17:46,600
God and anime.

3496
03:17:46,980 --> 03:17:48,040
Holding up this.

3497
03:17:49,040 --> 03:17:51,400
What if I shine it on your planet, huh?

3498
03:17:52,020 --> 03:17:52,760
What if I shine it on your planet, huh?

3499
03:17:52,760 --> 03:17:53,480
Really bright, huh?

3500
03:17:53,700 --> 03:17:54,660
You don't like that, huh?

3501
03:18:03,760 --> 03:18:05,120
So this is where...

3502
03:18:05,120 --> 03:18:06,960
We teleport into.

3503
03:18:07,300 --> 03:18:07,400
We teleport into.

3504
03:18:15,990 --> 03:18:17,790
And this is the visions.

3505
03:18:30,190 --> 03:18:31,390
They kidnap.

3506
03:18:31,690 --> 03:18:36,410
They de-thorax Matara.

3507
03:18:36,770 --> 03:18:37,750
Essentially.

3508
03:18:43,430 --> 03:18:44,030
Hold on.

3509
03:18:44,090 --> 03:18:44,910
While this is going on.

3510
03:18:45,050 --> 03:18:46,150
I'm gonna check on Pies.

3511
03:19:14,710 --> 03:19:16,330
She has wrapped herself.

3512
03:19:17,150 --> 03:19:18,030
In a blanket.

3513
03:19:20,770 --> 03:19:22,590
She has wrapped herself in a blanket.

3514
03:19:23,090 --> 03:19:24,730
She seems okay.

3515
03:19:25,090 --> 03:19:26,430
She seems like she's doing alright.

3516
03:19:33,380 --> 03:19:34,120
Let's see.

3517
03:19:35,760 --> 03:19:37,640
There's like a parkour maybe.

3518
03:19:38,100 --> 03:19:40,080
Is there anything even down here though?

3519
03:19:43,720 --> 03:19:45,320
Maybe here.

3520
03:19:46,240 --> 03:19:47,040
Parkour.

3521
03:19:52,600 --> 03:19:53,600
We're fine.

3522
03:20:01,990 --> 03:20:03,090
Dang it.

3523
03:20:20,560 --> 03:20:21,500
Give you one second.

3524
03:20:21,840 --> 03:20:24,340
Oh shoot.

3525
03:20:34,720 --> 03:20:36,720
I feel like I'm gonna be trapped here for a while.

3526
03:20:36,940 --> 03:20:40,500
I feel like I might have to cook on this a little bit.

3527
03:20:41,920 --> 03:20:43,240
I might have to...

3528
03:20:46,300 --> 03:20:47,920
I might have to...

3529
03:20:47,920 --> 03:20:49,560
I might have to...

3530
03:20:49,560 --> 03:20:49,600
I might have to...

3531
03:20:49,600 --> 03:20:49,620
I might have to...

3532
03:20:49,620 --> 03:20:50,740
think about this a little bit.

3533
03:20:52,260 --> 03:20:55,120
I did say I wanted today's stream to be only three hours.

3534
03:20:55,200 --> 03:20:55,780
But I feel like...

3535
03:20:55,780 --> 03:20:56,780
I mean we learned a lot.

3536
03:20:56,920 --> 03:20:57,680
But also I feel like...

3537
03:20:58,140 --> 03:21:01,300
I mean we

3538
03:21:04,780 --> 03:21:05,140
learned a lot.

3539
03:21:05,360 --> 03:21:06,820
You've got everything in dream 4.

3540
03:21:06,920 --> 03:21:08,720
Now try dream 2, 3, or 1.

3541
03:21:09,460 --> 03:21:09,940
You've got everything in dream 4.

3542
03:21:09,940 --> 03:21:09,940
Now try dream 2, 3, or 1.

3543
03:21:09,940 --> 03:21:10,440
Wait this is 4?

3544
03:21:13,500 --> 03:21:14,660
2, 3, or 1.

3545
03:21:18,080 --> 03:21:19,080
There's that one.

3546
03:21:20,680 --> 03:21:21,160
And...

3547
03:21:21,680 --> 03:21:22,860
Was there one over here?

3548
03:21:25,260 --> 03:21:26,960
There's this house right here.

3549
03:21:29,020 --> 03:21:31,000
That we have to enter through the other way.

3550
03:21:35,960 --> 03:21:37,180
And uh...

3551
03:21:37,180 --> 03:21:39,920
Don't think there was anyone here either.

3552
03:21:41,280 --> 03:21:41,960
And

3553
03:21:54,270 --> 03:21:54,950
uh...

3554
03:21:54,950 --> 03:21:55,350
There it goes.

3555
03:21:56,250 --> 03:21:56,290
There it goes.

3556
03:21:56,850 --> 03:21:57,890
Destroying everything.

3557
03:21:58,830 --> 03:22:00,250
Oh, am I in trouble?

3558
03:22:00,570 --> 03:22:02,610
Oh, am I in trouble?

3559
03:22:02,610 --> 03:22:03,390
No, we're okay!

3560
03:22:04,190 --> 03:22:06,770
That was so giddy giddy.

3561
03:22:07,050 --> 03:22:07,070
That was so giddy giddy.

3562
03:22:08,990 --> 03:22:11,210
That was really close actually.

3563
03:22:14,110 --> 03:22:14,750
We're alright!

3564
03:22:15,530 --> 03:22:15,590
We're alright!

3565
03:22:17,330 --> 03:22:18,430
Giddy giddy safe.

3566
03:22:19,090 --> 03:22:19,510
Giddy giddy safe.

3567
03:22:21,630 --> 03:22:22,050
Hmm...

3568
03:22:24,330 --> 03:22:25,670
I'm gonna try...

3569
03:22:25,670 --> 03:22:25,710
I'm gonna try...

3570
03:22:27,410 --> 03:22:30,430
Well that part's all gonna be destroyed in just a second, isn't it?

3571
03:22:30,530 --> 03:22:30,570
Well that part's all gonna be destroyed in just a second, isn't it?

3572
03:22:31,130 --> 03:22:32,650
We're gonna watch it all get...

3573
03:22:32,650 --> 03:22:33,390
Yep, there it goes!

3574
03:22:33,710 --> 03:22:34,470
There it goes!

3575
03:22:35,710 --> 03:22:37,250
But I think we can still go in there.

3576
03:22:42,780 --> 03:22:45,120
So there's a couple things that we need to figure out.

3577
03:22:45,480 --> 03:22:47,080
One is the...

3578
03:22:47,080 --> 03:22:49,280
The ghost matter cave.

3579
03:22:49,820 --> 03:22:50,880
What's the matter?

3580
03:22:51,100 --> 03:22:52,660
What's the ghost matter cave?

3581
03:22:54,220 --> 03:22:55,100
Oh my gosh.

3582
03:22:55,100 --> 03:22:56,340
Have you guys heard of...

3583
03:22:57,000 --> 03:22:58,360
Have you heard of the matter baby?

3584
03:23:03,320 --> 03:23:04,820
Have you heard of the matter baby?

3585
03:23:09,820 --> 03:23:11,140
What's the matter baby?

3586
03:23:12,460 --> 03:23:13,300
I don't know.

3587
03:23:13,320 --> 03:23:14,300
What's the matter with you?

3588
03:23:19,980 --> 03:23:21,600
The matter baby!

3589
03:23:28,640 --> 03:23:30,340
What's the matter baby?

3590
03:23:41,570 --> 03:23:43,590
The ghost matter baby.

3591
03:23:43,950 --> 03:23:43,970
The ghost matter baby.

3592
03:23:46,050 --> 03:23:47,990
This way, this way, this way...

3593
03:23:47,990 --> 03:23:48,210
This way, this way, this way...

3594
03:23:49,930 --> 03:23:50,890
Push, push, push!

3595
03:23:51,150 --> 03:23:51,770
Nice, nice, nice.

3596
03:24:02,220 --> 03:24:02,920
Artifact, you okay?

3597
03:24:03,260 --> 03:24:03,600
Yep.

3598
03:24:03,900 --> 03:24:04,480
All good.

3599
03:24:07,500 --> 03:24:07,940
Anyway...

3600
03:24:10,760 --> 03:24:12,240
I actually can't remember...

3601
03:24:13,540 --> 03:24:14,460
Which way it was.

3602
03:24:16,700 --> 03:24:17,520
I think it's...

3603
03:24:17,520 --> 03:24:18,700
That one up there maybe?

3604
03:24:20,100 --> 03:24:21,460
No, that's the projector room.

3605
03:24:23,540 --> 03:24:24,220
Up here maybe?

3606
03:24:34,170 --> 03:24:35,450
I think we can't...

3607
03:24:37,170 --> 03:24:38,110
Get up there.

3608
03:24:38,230 --> 03:24:39,870
No wait, that's uh...

3609
03:24:42,930 --> 03:24:43,870
Is there no...

3610
03:24:43,870 --> 03:24:45,370
Sleepy guys in this area?

3611
03:24:46,710 --> 03:24:47,190
Sleepy...

3612
03:24:47,850 --> 03:24:48,330
Sleepy...

3613
03:24:49,350 --> 03:24:51,370
Deer bird people in your area?

3614
03:24:55,450 --> 03:24:57,550
You can jump the bridge for sure from the top.

3615
03:24:57,730 --> 03:24:59,090
But can we get to the top?

3616
03:24:59,210 --> 03:25:02,710
The real question.

3617
03:25:02,710 --> 03:25:03,590
What?

3618
03:25:05,590 --> 03:25:08,570
I think I thought I was going somewhere but I...

3619
03:25:10,970 --> 03:25:11,950
Went the wrong...

3620
03:25:12,810 --> 03:25:13,730
Oh wait!

3621
03:25:14,250 --> 03:25:15,430
This is the cave...

3622
03:25:15,430 --> 03:25:17,730
This is a cave.

3623
03:25:19,190 --> 03:25:20,290
What was in here again?

3624
03:25:21,550 --> 03:25:22,490
Oh gosh.

3625
03:25:22,830 --> 03:25:25,190
Okay, I feel like I need to start taking notes or something.

3626
03:25:27,970 --> 03:25:29,330
It's a little overwhelming.

3627
03:25:30,050 --> 03:25:31,390
It's a lot of infor...

3628
03:25:31,390 --> 03:25:32,690
Oh, it's up there!

3629
03:25:32,930 --> 03:25:33,850
There it is!

3630
03:25:34,250 --> 03:25:35,010
Okay, okay, okay.

3631
03:25:45,240 --> 03:25:46,480
If we can get to the top.

3632
03:25:51,260 --> 03:25:52,960
Oh wait, this way, this way, this way.

3633
03:25:53,300 --> 03:25:54,240
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

3634
03:25:54,700 --> 03:25:55,500
Come on, come on!

3635
03:25:56,300 --> 03:25:57,660
I don't know if I can make that!

3636
03:25:58,280 --> 03:25:58,600
No!

3637
03:26:00,220 --> 03:26:00,540
No!

3638
03:26:09,950 --> 03:26:11,370
The river's too strong.

3639
03:26:15,840 --> 03:26:17,720
You know what, since we're here, let's go to the bell.

3640
03:26:18,500 --> 03:26:19,940
Oh my god, I thought that was a...

3641
03:26:19,940 --> 03:26:21,560
dancing egg again.

3642
03:26:22,860 --> 03:26:24,840
I thought there was an egg on my screen.

3643
03:26:28,460 --> 03:26:29,720
What are you up to currently?

3644
03:26:30,380 --> 03:26:31,160
I don't know.

3645
03:26:31,720 --> 03:26:33,100
I've never played this game.

3646
03:26:33,300 --> 03:26:34,720
Or this DLC before.

3647
03:26:35,160 --> 03:26:36,280
I have no idea.

3648
03:26:37,480 --> 03:26:39,600
What I'm up to, what I'm down to.

3649
03:26:40,360 --> 03:26:41,420
Down to clown.

3650
03:26:41,880 --> 03:26:43,300
That's what I'm always down to.

3651
03:26:44,840 --> 03:26:46,580
Always down to clown, baby.

3652
03:26:57,690 --> 03:26:58,470
Good morning!

3653
03:27:06,160 --> 03:27:07,640
Then they took it downstairs.

3654
03:27:17,550 --> 03:27:20,170
I don't see any doors or anything around here though.

3655
03:27:25,390 --> 03:27:28,390
We must also go downstairs.

3656
03:27:44,830 --> 03:27:46,370
We can't go through there.

3657
03:27:48,590 --> 03:27:50,170
We have to...

3658
03:27:50,170 --> 03:27:51,290
What is that?

3659
03:27:51,410 --> 03:27:52,770
We have to seal that up somehow.

3660
03:27:54,610 --> 03:27:55,470
I imagine.

3661
03:28:16,280 --> 03:28:16,840
Unless...

3662
03:28:16,840 --> 03:28:17,680
Do we...

3663
03:28:17,680 --> 03:28:23,890
Does it like seal up when...

3664
03:28:24,910 --> 03:28:27,730
When like the things fall or whatever, I wonder.

3665
03:28:29,870 --> 03:28:31,690
I'm gonna seal it up with...

3666
03:28:33,270 --> 03:28:33,790
I'm gonna seal it up with...

3667
03:28:33,790 --> 03:28:34,610
Gosh, what's that stuff?

3668
03:28:34,910 --> 03:28:35,130
Gosh, what's that stuff?

3669
03:28:35,390 --> 03:28:37,830
A guy like slams it on the ground?

3670
03:28:38,130 --> 03:28:38,830
Or on the...

3671
03:28:40,950 --> 03:28:42,370
Not flex tape.

3672
03:28:42,630 --> 03:28:43,650
Maybe it is flex tape.

3673
03:28:44,490 --> 03:28:45,670
Oh, it is flex tape!

3674
03:28:45,790 --> 03:28:46,730
Yeah, we're gonna...

3675
03:28:46,730 --> 03:28:48,510
With the flex tape.

3676
03:28:50,590 --> 03:28:51,110
Plants...

3677
03:28:52,510 --> 03:28:54,290
It's really peaceful over here.

3678
03:28:54,650 --> 03:28:55,010
It's really peaceful over here.

3679
03:29:05,140 --> 03:29:06,200
There's also a boat.

3680
03:29:09,340 --> 03:29:14,140
I wonder if I have to wait for like...

3681
03:29:33,080 --> 03:29:40,360
I wonder if I have to wait for like...

3682
03:29:40,360 --> 03:29:40,380
Oh!

3683
03:29:45,320 --> 03:29:47,660
Do they scream when the tower falls?

3684
03:29:50,180 --> 03:29:50,900
Interesting.

3685
03:29:54,600 --> 03:29:56,340
But nothing covers it up.

3686
03:29:56,740 --> 03:29:57,100
Oh!

3687
03:29:57,240 --> 03:29:57,740
Oh!

3688
03:29:57,780 --> 03:29:58,380
Oh!

3689
03:29:58,380 --> 03:29:59,620
Goodness gracious.

3690
03:30:00,020 --> 03:30:00,800
I'm sorry.

3691
03:30:06,640 --> 03:30:08,080
Have you ever heard of...

3692
03:30:08,080 --> 03:30:08,780
Have you ever heard of...

3693
03:30:08,780 --> 03:30:09,320
Good dog?

3694
03:30:10,440 --> 03:30:11,060
What's that?

3695
03:30:14,780 --> 03:30:16,960
Can I conceal it and go into the water?

3696
03:30:18,780 --> 03:30:19,900
Can I conceal it and go into the water?

3697
03:30:19,900 --> 03:30:20,720
Actually, let's try it.

3698
03:30:20,740 --> 03:30:21,780
Since we're about to die anyway.

3699
03:30:26,560 --> 03:30:27,120
Nope.

3700
03:30:28,960 --> 03:30:30,880
I guess worth a shot.

3701
03:30:31,880 --> 03:30:31,940
I guess worth a shot.

3702
03:30:39,700 --> 03:30:41,160
Oh, what's good, dog?

3703
03:30:44,720 --> 03:30:45,780
What's good, dog?

3704
03:30:50,160 --> 03:30:51,800
You're cooking though, in any case.

3705
03:30:51,920 --> 03:30:52,400
I'm trying.

3706
03:30:52,640 --> 03:30:53,080
I'm trying.

3707
03:30:54,440 --> 03:30:55,220
I'm trying.

3708
03:30:55,400 --> 03:30:55,760
I'm trying.

3709
03:30:57,860 --> 03:30:59,580
I think I'm gonna have to cook.

3710
03:30:59,760 --> 03:31:00,940
I think I'm gonna have to...

3711
03:31:01,600 --> 03:31:02,820
Let this one...

3712
03:31:03,820 --> 03:31:05,740
Sit in my brain for...

3713
03:31:05,740 --> 03:31:06,740
Until next time.

3714
03:31:07,800 --> 03:31:08,620
I think.

3715
03:31:15,560 --> 03:31:16,120
Marinate.

3716
03:31:17,360 --> 03:31:19,120
We'll continue next week.

3717
03:31:19,740 --> 03:31:21,120
We'll finish it next week.

3718
03:31:23,240 --> 03:31:23,800
Hmm.

3719
03:31:24,000 --> 03:31:24,640
You're close.

3720
03:31:25,380 --> 03:31:27,580
I don't even know what I'm close to though.

3721
03:31:30,140 --> 03:31:32,480
I don't even know what I'm close to though.

3722
03:31:32,480 --> 03:31:32,740
I don't even know what I'm close to though.

3723
03:31:32,740 --> 03:31:33,620
I've got to figure stuff out.

3724
03:31:35,240 --> 03:31:35,800
Okay.

3725
03:31:36,280 --> 03:31:37,940
So I am still missing something.

3726
03:31:38,940 --> 03:31:39,740
I mean...

3727
03:31:40,540 --> 03:31:42,780
I figured, but...

3728
03:31:44,420 --> 03:31:46,760
One place we also need to go back to...

3729
03:31:46,760 --> 03:31:48,740
Is that one place that...

3730
03:31:48,740 --> 03:31:50,380
Had the guy watching TV.

3731
03:31:52,480 --> 03:31:53,040
Yeah.

3732
03:31:54,060 --> 03:31:55,480
Close to like five things.

3733
03:31:57,320 --> 03:31:59,740
I don't even know what I'm close to.

3734
03:32:02,040 --> 03:32:02,720
I don't even know what I'm close to.

3735
03:32:02,720 --> 03:32:03,100
I wish...

3736
03:32:03,100 --> 03:32:05,540
I miss when my biggest mystery was...

3737
03:32:05,540 --> 03:32:08,160
What was firing out of that cannon.

3738
03:32:10,780 --> 03:32:12,100
I wish when that...

3739
03:32:12,100 --> 03:32:12,820
I wish...

3740
03:32:12,820 --> 03:32:13,540
I miss...

3741
03:32:14,420 --> 03:32:17,920
I miss when that was the biggest mystery.

3742
03:32:26,830 --> 03:32:28,650
But I'll go through some of this stuff.

3743
03:32:30,150 --> 03:32:31,410
And figure it out.

3744
03:32:31,550 --> 03:32:32,650
Or try to figure it out.

3745
03:32:33,230 --> 03:32:34,150
I will cook.

3746
03:32:36,770 --> 03:32:37,050
Until...

3747
03:32:38,510 --> 03:32:41,110
Until I can cook no longer.

3748
03:32:41,270 --> 03:32:43,050
Until it is burnt, fried...

3749
03:32:43,050 --> 03:32:46,150
Until it is burnt, fried...

3750
03:32:46,150 --> 03:32:47,010
Unrecognizable.

3751
03:32:51,480 --> 03:32:52,980
The arrows give you info.

3752
03:32:54,340 --> 03:32:54,900
Yeah.

3753
03:32:57,120 --> 03:32:57,680
Projection.

3754
03:32:57,700 --> 03:33:01,000
It reveals a cave entrance at the base of a rocky island with a tall tower.

3755
03:33:01,380 --> 03:33:01,420
It reveals a cave entrance at the base of a rocky island with a tall tower.

3756
03:33:01,420 --> 03:33:01,800
Yeah.

3757
03:33:01,900 --> 03:33:02,640
I went there.

3758
03:33:02,800 --> 03:33:03,640
I saw that.

3759
03:33:03,840 --> 03:33:04,920
I totally did that.

3760
03:33:05,340 --> 03:33:07,700
I can't figure out this dang tower!

3761
03:33:09,840 --> 03:33:10,280
You!

3762
03:33:10,280 --> 03:33:11,600
You stinkin' tower.

3763
03:33:12,200 --> 03:33:13,700
The hidden vault seals.

3764
03:33:17,440 --> 03:33:19,300
Why can't they just show me the code?

3765
03:33:19,460 --> 03:33:20,900
They wrote their password on the wall.

3766
03:33:21,080 --> 03:33:22,960
Why can't they show me also the password?

3767
03:33:24,760 --> 03:33:26,600
In their projection as well.

3768
03:33:26,820 --> 03:33:28,060
In the visions, huh?

3769
03:33:28,460 --> 03:33:29,960
Why can't they show me there too?

3770
03:33:31,960 --> 03:33:33,320
You're making plenty of progress.

3771
03:33:33,380 --> 03:33:33,960
Just keep going.

3772
03:33:34,400 --> 03:33:35,100
I will.

3773
03:33:35,220 --> 03:33:36,200
I will next week.

3774
03:33:36,200 --> 03:33:36,660
Mhm.

3775
03:33:37,800 --> 03:33:38,220
Yeah.

3776
03:33:43,820 --> 03:33:46,000
It's really fantastic watching you play through this game.

3777
03:33:46,080 --> 03:33:47,740
Your enthusiasm and energy are top tier!

3778
03:33:47,820 --> 03:33:48,680
You'll figure it out soon.

3779
03:33:48,760 --> 03:33:49,240
Thank you!

3780
03:33:50,020 --> 03:33:50,440
Ah!

3781
03:33:50,980 --> 03:33:55,060
I want to keep going, but I do need to get some good sleep tonight.

3782
03:33:55,520 --> 03:33:56,620
That's what I will be doing.

3783
03:33:56,760 --> 03:33:58,360
I will be cutting it off here.

3784
03:33:58,480 --> 03:34:02,400
I even went a little bit over what I was planning on.

3785
03:34:05,160 --> 03:34:10,500
Oh, how naive I was to think that I would solve this in two streams.

3786
03:34:10,820 --> 03:34:11,620
But that's okay.

3787
03:34:11,840 --> 03:34:13,340
It is what it is.

3788
03:34:14,360 --> 03:34:16,600
I also have some work that I have to do.

3789
03:34:17,140 --> 03:34:19,640
So I'm going to go do that before I go to sleep.

3790
03:34:19,860 --> 03:34:21,720
Thank you guys for joining me again today!

3791
03:34:22,260 --> 03:34:23,680
I hope you guys...

3792
03:34:23,680 --> 03:34:25,800
Your brains are hurting as much as mine is.

3793
03:34:27,520 --> 03:34:29,560
We learned so much though.

3794
03:34:29,620 --> 03:34:31,340
Like a crazy amount.

3795
03:34:31,920 --> 03:34:32,380
We learned so much though.

3796
03:34:32,400 --> 03:34:42,780
It was very interesting to It was very interesting to go into the spooky world and finally get the spookiness of the DLC.

3797
03:34:43,100 --> 03:34:44,040
Thanks for streaming!

3798
03:34:44,220 --> 03:34:45,080
It always makes me smile.

3799
03:34:45,220 --> 03:34:45,680
Thank you!

3800
03:34:46,040 --> 03:34:47,440
Have a good rest and well soon.

3801
03:34:47,560 --> 03:34:48,480

03:34:50,820 --> 03:34:51,720
Thank you for your hard work!

3804
03:34:54,920 --> 03:34:56,400
Thank you for your hard work!

3805
03:34:56,440 --> 03:35:00,240
And tomorrow is chill.

3806
03:35:00,580 --> 03:35:01,720
Tomorrow is fun.

3807
03:35:02,760 --> 03:35:06,000
No brain hurty game of deal or no deal.

3808
03:35:06,260 --> 03:35:07,840
So, otsuminto everybody!

3809
03:35:08,600 --> 03:35:09,360
Thank you!

3810
03:35:09,580 --> 03:35:10,720
I would stick around more.

3811
03:35:10,820 --> 03:35:12,780
Luckily this tea is helping my throat a whole lot.

3812
03:35:12,980 --> 03:35:15,840
But I'm going to go rest my voice now.

3813
03:35:16,340 --> 03:35:18,060
I had double streams today too.

3814
03:35:18,380 --> 03:35:18,780
So...

3815
03:35:20,900 --> 03:35:21,920
It's been a busy day.

3816
03:35:22,580 --> 03:35:23,060
Otsuminto!

3817
03:35:23,280 --> 03:35:24,420
Have a good night everybody!

3818
03:35:24,920 --> 03:35:26,380
Thank you for helping me out!

3819
03:35:26,540 --> 03:35:28,900
We'll solve more mysteries next time.

3820
03:35:29,580 --> 03:35:30,440
Bye bye!

3821
03:35:31,720 --> 03:35:31,940
Wait...

3822
03:35:33,680 --> 03:35:35,480
Okay, pause is still in the blanket.

3823
03:35:36,300 --> 03:35:37,040
Bye bye!

3824
03:35:37,280 --> 03:35:37,740
Bye bye!
