1
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:31,390
I am once again eating my dinner.

2
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,650
Hello everybody, I'm back.

3
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,330
Oh, hi everybody.

4
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,370
Oh, hi, oh, oh,

5
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,330
oh, oh.

6
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,430
We may be made in this, but we're made full.

7
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,410
Thank you guys.

8
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,270
Thank you.

9
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,690
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

10
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,010
What am I eating today?

11
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,710
I'm eating chicken and rice once again.

12
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,450
And once again, eating chicken and rice.

13
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,070
Hold on.

14
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:15,990
Hold on.

15
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,450
I meant I found four kittens in a storm drain near my house.

16
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,390
What do they...

17
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,810
What do...

18
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,410
Oh, what do?

19
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,050
They look healthy and are so, so, so cute.

20
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,130
Keep.

21
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,750
Four kittens, that's a lot, though.

22
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,830
That's a lot.

23
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,090
Chicken is appropriate considering the game.

24
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,670
So true, we went to the chicken kitchen, didn't we?

25
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,050
Chicken kitchen, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken,
chicken.

26
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:56,850
No.

27
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,490
Sounds healthy.

28
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,610
Unless it's karage.

29
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,550
It's not karage.

30
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,910
I'm kind of healthy sometimes.

31
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,410
I'm kind of healthy.

32
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,810
Howdy, howdy.

33
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,690
Hope you're well.

34
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,750
Detect the phantoms.

35
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,090
Wait, getting news.

36
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,550
This may not be the point.

37
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,530
Thanks to the Super Chat!

38
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,710
I wonder what this buy and send button does.

39
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,910
You might want to check your bank account.

40
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,690
I think that'll answer it.

41
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:29,790
I think.

42
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:30,910
Maybe.

43
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,090
Mmm, karage.

44
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,250
Now I'm thinking about karage.

45
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,610
Bye, chicken.

46
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,410
Mmm.

47
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,350
Yummy!

48
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,150
Welcome back to Ghost Trick.

49
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,930
I kind of want to just get into it today, if that's okay.

50
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:59,090
I kind of want to just dive right on in so we can start
doing some ghost tricks and tips and tricks.

51
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,770
What was I going to say though?

52
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,370
Oh, I was going to do a recap.

53
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,150
Thank you, thank you.

54
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,430
Thank you!

55
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,650
Uh...

56
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:13,950
Uh...

57
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,630
Did you hear that?

58
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,650
Maid, Momo and Midori are going to be playable.

59
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,010
What?!

60
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,150
They're gonna be playable!

61
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,150
Have fun ghost drinking!

62
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,150
I did not hear that.

63
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,950
Maid Momo and Midori!

64
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,450
I will get them both.

65
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:34,730
Goodbye.

66
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,930
Goodbye, jemmies.

67
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,190
Yay!

68
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,990

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,670

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,180
Recap!

74
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,980
Sorry, I have to, like, lean over to get my food.

75
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,180
Because of the way my desk is.

76
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,960
Where did we...

77
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,220
I know where we left off on.

78
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,700
But I'm trying to think of what...

79
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,220
Okay, so...

80
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,040
Oh, we started with the execution.

81
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,100
And we had to turn the power off.

82
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,700
And we had to get our...

83
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,740
Get the Chadman...

84
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,920
in a very stealthy sequence.

85
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,580
Omji, the bank just charged me.

86
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,760
Lamau, Lamau, Lamau, get charged, get charged, get charged.

87
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,620
Chad Jowd.

88
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,060
Yes, Detective Jowd.

89
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,520
And we watched a guy gulp down a bunch of pills.

90
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,600
Yes, that happened too.

91
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,340
Yes, yes, yes.

92
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,000
So we got him through the jail.

93
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,360
He jailbreak, baby.

94
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,240
But then he got caught.

95
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,060
It was all for nothing.

96
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,720
He got caught by Elvis Detective.

97
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,220
Did Lynn die again?

98
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,300
I don't think she did.

99
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,400
I don't think she did.

100
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,200
I just finished catching up to your previous Ghost Trick
streams.

101
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,060
I'm right on time.

102
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,680
Let's go!

103
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,520
Thank you so much for watching them.

104
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,080
I really appreciate it.

105
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,300
Thank you.

106
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,940
Silly boy, welcome to membership.

107
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:05,680
And so then, after that, happened And after we got him out,
Lynn went to the commissioner guy to say, stop his

108
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,340
execution.

109
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,160
But we realized the reason he's going through with the
execution, maybe Cortex with a five-gifted thingies of it,

110
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:19,320
the reason he's going through with the execution is because
his daughter has been kidnapped by the hot blue lady.

111
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,740
Yippee!

112
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,760
Yeah!

113
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,320
Blue lady!

114
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:38,820
so um we ended off on um but actually the daughter wasn't
kidnapped if she was just a hot lady um as a ghost what's it

115
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,380
feel like when you encounter offuda or she day

116
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:57,860
as a ghost i feel nothing every day i feel nothing

117
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,090
what was i gonna say oh

118
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:29,100
and oh yeah we're now checking out the hot blue lady so i'm
excited for this part so we're challenges oh wait just

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:39,640

how's the audio i think the main menu is a little quiet but

120
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,440
um yes see the auto save we're at 12 10 a.m

121
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,580
Oh yeah, we did save the Commissioner's life by giving him
his meds.

122
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,160
He went...

123
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,740
He...

124
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,280
He...

125
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,720
He...

126
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,220
He...

127
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,620
He...

128
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:57,820
He...

129
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,020
He was used to that.

130
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,240
He was...

131
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,600
Yeah.

132
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,780
Um, but yeah, let's go back into the auto save.

133
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,480
Let's just get right into it, baby.

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,700
I wonder if I should turn DVR off for this.

135
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,880
So people coming in can just kind of watch.

136
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,160
10 a.m.

137
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,580
The justice minister's daughter has been abducted.

138
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:29,580
The kidnappers demand the execution of the death row
prisoner Zhao to be carried out tonight.

139
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,700
Yes, this is a good recap.

140
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,580
She's so high.

141
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,380
Oh, oh, ma'am.

142
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,180
Even your silhouette.

143
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,340
Look at the way she just just power sits.

144
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,140
I've never seen a power sit before like that.

145
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,640
Lynn says the execution is a mistake and I believe her.

146
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:56,580
So I'm paying the kidnappers hideout a visit to see what I
can find out about the abduction yeah that's a practice sit

147
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:06,240
I want to be that chair I want to be that chair wanna be
that chair wanna be that chair wanna be that chair Mike

148
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:23,980
Tyson thanks for the vibe gifted what took you so long who's
here Oh, my goodness.

149
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,380
Your instinct was right, Beauty, my dear.

150
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,740
No, not this guy.

151
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,440
They had that restaurant surrounded.

152
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,780
It took me forever to shake them.

153
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,280
And now my poor bike is ready for the scrap heap.

154
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,140
Not Shaggy.

155
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,880
Forgot about the voice.

156
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,260
It fits him, though, doesn't it?

157
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,480
Ugh.

158
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,100
Whoa!

159
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:02,500
Next time, maybe you should st- Oh no, I can't be hot.

160
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,400
I can't do it.

161
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,380
Next time, maybe you should make it a tricycle so you don't
hurt yourself.

162
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,040
Ouch, that hurts, beauty.

163
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,580
But that's okay.

164
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,820
That's what I love about you.

165
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,480
I can't unhear Shaggy.

166
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:34,020
I'm doing the voice I'm doing the voice And I can't unhear

00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,960
See that beauty?

170
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,380
Uh, maybe that's better.

171
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,460
There's a smile blooming on your face too, my dear.

172
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,060
I bought, played, and finished this after your second
stream.

173
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,440
All the characters were voiced in my head as you had voiced
them.

174
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,340
Thanks, I think.

175
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,660
You are truly minto.

176
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,660
Minto-minded.

177
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,780
Minto-minded, minto-minded.

178
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,400
Thank you so much.

179
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,220
Yes, a rye smile.

180
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,230
I'm going out for a breath of fresh air.

181
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,870
You're on guard duty.

182
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,490
All right.

183
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,450
I'll dream of you until you return.

184
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,190
Why don't you open the trunk for our guest?

185
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,810
I will, beauty.

186
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,210
I was just taking a little breather.

187
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,830
So when I asked for sultry Minto a while back, this was it.

188
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,470
Oh!

189
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,610
Also, I am gonna turn up the sounds just a little bit.

190
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,170
Maybe like that.

191
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,410
Sorry, I just don't want it being... I know I do this every
time.

192
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:19,910
Jaho!

193
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:20,770
Thanks for the gifting!

194
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,960
Alright, little lady.

195
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,340
Let me open that trunk for you.

196
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,240
Oh.

197
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:35,880
Okay.

198
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,840
Oh, is he actually going to fall asleep?

199
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,360
Beauty.

200
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,040
Oh, wait.

201
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,680
There was a birthday party here.

202
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,840
Look, because there's, like, streamers, and then there's a
birthday cake.

203
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,600
Looks like the Justice Minister's daughter really has been
kidnapped.

204
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,540
Something else is bothering me, too.

205
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,620
Wait, if we go back to their house, though, I don't think
I've ever been to this room before.

206
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,980
But something about it is giving me a strange sense of deja
vu.

207
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:17,220
this before yes this is just like the room in the that that
Lynn got killed in I'll let you guess which one trick time

208
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:26,700
trick time trick time taking something oh okay I want to
bring something up that someone uh one big streamer on am I

209
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:37,820
too big here I'll make myself small sorry am I too big um so
last time I played I got I saw like a comment from someone

210
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:49,200
that said that they were kind of sad that I was skipping
some of the funniest dialogue because because I was trying

211
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:58,580
not to get hints for the puzzles and while I understand that
you know sometimes I there might be stuff that I miss in

212
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:07,840
general you know I'll be I'll do better about you know what
i won't care so much about the hint stuff so so much this

213
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:21,680
time um if anything not big enough thank you for the first
ever super time thank you thanks to vegetable ghosts but um

214
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:30,240
so but also i i you know and sometimes in games like this
there might be stuff that i miss so um that's just kind of

215
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:41,000
the nature of these types of games maybe dialogue so um some
of the funny dialogue is in the word bubbles yeah so um i'll

216
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:53,420
do my best to um to to hit them but sometimes i might forget
so yeah sorry if i do okay that's all i wanted to talk about

217
00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:01,660
since i got reminded because of the bubble taking something
precious to manipulate others So that's what kidnapping is.

218
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,440
I guess.

219
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,320
But doesn't the kid need to be involved?

220
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,820
The dirty tricks those without...

221
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,080
Wait.

222
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,720
The dirty tricks those without the powers of the dead.

223
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:14,620
Oh.

224
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:15,860
Oh!

225
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,400
The dirty tricks those without the powers of the dead come
up with.

226
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,040
My goodness.

227
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,340
I cannot comprehend this.

228
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,460
Deposit in Mint Bank TM.

229
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:28,820
Thank you.

230
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,400
DING!

231
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,220
Deposited.

232
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,440
However, if I take that precious thing back...

233
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,380
Marissa, oh my god.

234
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,180
Sissel stole the precious thing.

235
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,660
Kirai.

236
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,680
Kirai.

237
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:52,180
If I take that precious thing back, their power vanishes,
doesn't it?

238
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,400
So true.

239
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,220
Look at this.

240
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,760
Look at this bozo sleeping on the job.

241
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,980
Now then.

242
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,660
Time to see Jahat.

Oh, okay.

248
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,460
I can't go trick.

249
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay, never mind.

250
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,120

Swing!

254
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,140
Oh.

255
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,980
It doesn't do so much.

256
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,060
Oh.

257
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,400
Okay.

258
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,870
Swing!

259
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,630
Why does it go so far to the left but not to the right?

260
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,990
Okay, there was one other thing we can do, which is this.

261
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:10,810
Burn dry.

262
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,370
Oh!

263
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,630
It's on fire!

264
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:13,250
Oh!

265
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,150
Oh my god!

266
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,030
Oh, we just... Oh, we just caused a fire.

267
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,830
Wait.

268
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,270
Oh!

269
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,250
But that's gonna drop then.

270
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,190
I knew it!

271
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,010
Here I thought we were gonna be setting the place on fire.

272
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,130
But, uh...

273
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,410
Okay, now we swing here.

274
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,440
Let's spin faster.

275
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,280
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.

276
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,140
Oh, interesting.

277
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,840
Oh, my bad.

278
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,520
Hold on.

279
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,740
Let's see.

280
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,580
What did that say?

281
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,100
The ball.

282
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:03,920
A ball.

283
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,440
All that rolls off a table.

284
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,640
I've already seen something like this once already tonight.

285
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,280
It's true.

286
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,280
I wonder if this ball does anything.

287
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:26,660
Now we're here, here, lower the shade, move the sconce,
suspend the shelf, I mean, mantle the clock.

288
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,760
Let's move down.

289
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,280
Lower the shade.

290
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,060
Oh.

291
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,740
I'm under his...

292
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,300
Oh, darn.

293
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,240
I can't reach my destination from here.

294
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,740
Oh.

295
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,720
Okay.

296
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:49,960
Thank you.

297
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,800
What if we rock and the clock falls?

298
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:57,940
No.

299
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,680
The shelf is suspended by very thin cords.

300
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,920
They look like they're about...

301
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,400
to break.

302
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,660
I bet it'd be quite a spectacle if that if something can
break it oh wait if something can break it kind of makes me

303
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,300
want to break it.

304
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,880
Oh my gosh Cicil why are you such a why are you such a
troublemaker huh?

305
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,180
That just huh?

306
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,780
This is one of those things you light with fire isn't it?

307
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,800
Do we need to really set this place on fire?

308
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,660
As long as there's light in the room Is something like this
really necessary?

309
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,360
But if something can be lit, it kind of makes you want to
light it.

310
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,580
I need another core to reach the trunk and open it.

311
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,580
I wonder if I can create a new core.

312
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,060
So we need to burn this.

313
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,680
We need to set things on fire, baby.

314
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,980
He is truly a menace.

315
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,140
Doll.

316
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,920
Let's go back to where we were.

317
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,500
before.

318
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,900
Oh, I'm already feeling myself getting so hungry.

319
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,640
Wait.

320
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:09,440
Oh, wait.

321
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,040
Yeah, we can uh...

322
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,260
Oh, wait.

323
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,100
We can...

324
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,500
We can go back this way.

325
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,260
Like so.

326
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:20,700
Okay.

327
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,860
Easy peasy.

328
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:22,820
Hmm.

329
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,520
Now, if I open the door...

330
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,540
Oh!

331
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,490
I was gonna possess the ball.

332
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:35,730
Hmm.

333
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,270
Food check.

334
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,310
I have my food.

335
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,590

Hmm.

341
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,760

Hearing you sing Final Fantasy songs, warms my JRPG loving
heart.

359
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,730
Do you have a favorite Final Fantasy game?

360
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,550
I'll be honest, I haven't played so many Final Fantasy
games.

361
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,410
So I probably like my first one, which was...

362
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,970
Well, actually I played Final Fantasy XII first.

363
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:12,590
But I really like Final Fantasy X and XII.

364
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:14,570
Hmm.

365
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,640
Let's see what happens if we spin this.

366
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,780
It's going to go up.

367
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,900
And then it goes back down.

368
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,840
Okay, but I can't do anything while it's doing that.

369
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:38,780
Okay.

370
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,200
Cool.

371
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,700
Maybe.

372
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,660
Maybe we have this firecracker.

373
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,520
Okay, you know what?

374
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,500
Let's just go.

375
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,600
Party popper.

376
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,060
Fire!

377
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:06,600
I was gonna say maybe if I was gonna say maybe would get
something stuck either on the spinner or on the fan Nice

378
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:17,180
Okay 6 9 and 12 are my favorites Oh and then I've also I've
played a little bit of 7 But I know I've watched

379
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:23,800
Playthroughs of 7 so Just my imagination That's all he has
to say.

380
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,360
If he was any more laid back, he'd fall right off that
crate.

381
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,520
But look at that streamer going, go, go spinning round and
round.

382
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,960
Now how can I make use of that?

383
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,940
Yes, yes, yes.

384
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,360
Where am I?

385
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,460
Oh, I'm on the party popper.

386
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,820
Maybe we get it tied up here.

387
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,560
Get tied up!

388
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,040
it reach?

389
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,880
Not enough for the fire.

390
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,540
I think I'm just gonna have to set the place on fire.

391
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:07,460
Fire!

392
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:08,960
Oh!

393
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,370
That leads, just my imagination.

394
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,590
That leads straight up to the fire.

395
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,950
Fire, fire.

396
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,010
Light the fire.

397
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,410
What an amazingly simple fellow.

398
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,970
This room, on the other hand, is starting to look amazingly
festive.

399
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,150
The question is, how can I use it to my advantage?

400
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,370
Okay.

401
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,150
Okay.

402
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:39,770
If I bring this up now, what does it do?

403
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,590
It's all tied up.

404
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,150
Interesting, okay.

405
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,160
I'm still confused what to do with the spinning guy, though.

406
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm actually kind of stumped.

407
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,630
Hmm.

408
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,490
Yeah, there's a candle on the doll too.

409
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,990
Yes, I have noticed that.

410
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,690
I have noted that, yes.

411
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,250
I think does the string...

412
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,110
Hold on, let's see.

413
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,830
Does it reach...

414
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,010
No, it doesn't...

415
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,190
I was like, maybe if that catches on fire and then spins
over to her...

416
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,210
Hmm.

417
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,690
We've done...

418
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,350
Let's raise it...

419
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,630
The fire again, maybe.

420
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:05,990
Shoo!

421
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,390
Ghost!

422
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,870
And back this way.

423
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:11,490
Oh, dang.

424
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,850
And this way.

425
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,130
And this way, this way, this way, this way.

426
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,910
Burn brighter.

427
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,450
Not.

428
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,990
Doesn't reach.

429
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,950
When the flame gets really big like this, for some reason I
get the urge to burn something.

430
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,630
Unfortunately, everything is just out of the flame's reach.

431
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,190
Yeah.

432
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,430
There's nothing else I can interact with except the door.

433
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,510
Oh, come on.

434
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,870
Oh, come on.

435
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,620
Oh, maybe it's been faster.

436
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:57,920
That's right.

437
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:58,640
Ah!

438
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,000
Oh!

439
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:00,380
Oh!

440
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,440
Okay.

441
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,540
That's right.

442
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:02,960
Ah!

443
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,020
Okay, there we go.

444
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,740
There we go.

445
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,180
Burn!

446
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:05,520
Burn!

447
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,160
Burn!

448
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,100
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn!

449
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,940
Oh my god.

450
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,220
Oh my god, it's on fire.

451
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,180
Oh, I figured it out.

452
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:18,680
Good luck.

453
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,860
I figured it out too.

454
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,400
Wait.

455
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,380
Okay, so that's on fire now.

456
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:32,660
And now we need to raise this to be on fire as well.

457
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,260
I figured it out too.

458
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,360
Spin!

459
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,540
What about the ball, though?

460
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:53,570
Nice!

461
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,110
Oh!

462
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,110
Just your imagination.

463
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,050
Yep.

464
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,070
Ten-sai.

465
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,530
Thank you, thank you.

466
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,870
And we're in, baby.

467
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,890
That's the daughter!

468
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,350
Wait, she's just chilling.

469
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,970
What in the...

470
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,490
What's going on here?

471
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,790
Whose footprints are these?

472
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,090
This little lady is.

473
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,030
Her, I thought it was the girl in the bed.

474
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,490
Is this little lady really a daughter of the justice
minister?

475
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,080
Oh, just my imagination.

476
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,040
It was not...

477
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,160
Oh.

478
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,620
Uh.

479
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,440
They caught the wrong girl.

480
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,200
What's with the fun book and juice?

481
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,460
Oh.

482
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,440
Like I said, always keep a smile on a lady's face.

483
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,400
I wanted to treat our guest well.

484
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,500
How about treating me well?

485
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,100
Ooh!

486
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,420
Oh my gosh, Shaggy.

487
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,300
Are you telling you're not treating my girl well?

488
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,960
Should have been me.

489
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,100
I'll treat you well.

490
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,720
I'll treat you well, Madam Blue.

491
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,120
Mm-hmm.

492
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,720
I volunteer.

493
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,860
I volunteer.

494
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,380
Mmm.

495
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,740
I'd like some bread and milk, please.

496
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,960
Not your sir.

497
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,120
Oh,

498
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,610
no, am I shaggy?

499
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,770
Why did I know what he was going to say?

500
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,120
Oh, no.

501
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,400
I don't know.

502
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,120
You're a maid, that's why?

503
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,540
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

504
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,480
That's all, that's all, that's all.

505
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,480
It's only because I'm a maid, everybody.

506
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,080
It's only because I'm a maid.

507
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:28,600
made everybody oh no at your service my dear me back in a
flash you better skedaddle out of there I better see you I

509
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:45,780

been... kidnapped?

510
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,480
Oh...

511
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,880
Oh...

512
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,360
No cry, little dear.

513
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,360
There's nothing to be afraid of.

514
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,900
The surroundings are miserable and filthy, I know, but we
just ask for a little patience.

515
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,960
Don't say those awful things about this house.

516
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,320
Hmm...

517
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,100
This house is...

518
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,380
Where I used to live.

519
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,400
So what does...

520
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,180
What does the guy from the...

521
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,680
How does the guy...

522
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,400
From the junkyard...

523
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,620
Know...

524
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,240
What her room looks like?

525
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,460
Zoinks.

526
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:35,940
What?

527
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,340
Nani?

528
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,940
I apologize, little lady.

529
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,900
I'm the one who's miserable and filthy.

530
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:46,880
Forgive me.

531
00:34:50,880 --> 00:35:10,740
Wait, so I think my theory last time was that was that Lynn
killed the mom but now I'm thinking it was accidentally her.

532
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:11,760
What's her name?

533
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:21,580
Now I'm thinking is that maybe it's her But Lynn still knows
the truth about Detective Jowd.

534
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,020
Camilla, Camilla, yeah, yeah, yeah, Camilla, Camilla.

535
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,780
DL6 Incident.

536
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:35,480
Ah, that would be on, that would be, that would be on brand
for this, for this creator.

537
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,880
What's the meaning of this beauty?

538
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,040
Why here at this little, at this girl's old house?

539
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,020
Don't ask me.

540
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,860
It was the other party in our deal who chose this location.

541
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,340
Oh, oh, I see.

542
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,180
It's been empty for five years, and apparently nobody ever
comes here.

543
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,220
But never mind that.

544
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,260
What about my bread and milk?

545
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,800
Oh, oh, of course.

546
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,300
Skedaddle now, Shaggy.

547
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,940
Now you be a good girl while I'm gone.

548
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,500
Oh my god, look at him tiptoe.

549
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,540
Hurry up!

550
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,580
Go get the bread and milk!

551
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,560
Let the ladies speak.

552
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,460
You just read your book and drink your juice.

553
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,580
You'll never know the truth.

554
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,060
There's not a parrot in sight.

555
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,900
I want to go home.

556
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,240
Not quite yet.

557
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,320
Hmm.

558
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:38,780
Hmm.

559
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,960
This dilapidated place was Camilla's old house?

560
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,700
What's going on here?

561
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,740
Trick time.

562
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,640
Alright, Camilla.

563
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,180
Camilla...

564
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,960
Wait, what?

565
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,680
What in the world?

566
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,400
Why does the little lady have a core of the dead?

567
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,040
I was gonna say, she never died before.

568
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,400
When I helped her out at Lynn's apartment...

569
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,580
Wait, no, she did die technically, though, right?

570
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,260
Because...

571
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,560
Um...

572
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,220
Wait, actually, I'm not sure.

573
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:08,800
Wait.

574
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:09,700
No.

575
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,220
Because he killed the dog and then her.

576
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,020
But we never talked to her.

577
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:19,000
it was her dog oh you're right

578
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:28,520
maybe I just assumed that she was going to die but it was
actually her going to get kidnapped

579
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:40,290
when I helped her out Lynn's apartment she didn't have one
so that must mean

580
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:49,510
she must have died sometime after that Once again, the
incident.

581
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,770
Wait, what incident?

582
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:55,130
And it also means somebody else must have saved her.

583
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:57,670
Wait, what?

584
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,850
I'd better ask her what happened.

585
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,510
Unless something that we fixed saved her, right?

586
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,430
That could happen.

587
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,810
What's the book she's reading?

588
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,370
A book.

589
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,910
I wonder what the little lady is reading tonight.

590
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:16,750
story maybe?

591
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,870
Although she's already getting quite a bit of excitement for
one day.

592
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,690
Look at her sipping, she's so cute.

593
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,310
Somewhere along the way, Camilla must have died.

594
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,750
What could have happened to her?

595
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,090
I better ask her.

596
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:31,930
Could it be?

597
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,950
There's somebody else with the powers of the dead besides
me!

598
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,510
Okay, let's get inside her brain.

599
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,530
Who's there?

600
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,150
Oh, wait a minute.

601
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,850
Is that Wait, Missile!

602
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,570
Missile!

603
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,950
I'm sorry, I'm not Missile.

604
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,170
My name's Cecil.

605
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,270
Did Missile save her?

606
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:57,910
No way.

607
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:58,990
Cecil?

608
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,610
My name is Camilla.

609
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,710
Yeah, where is Missile actually?

610
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,030
Camilla.

611
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,370
So it is her.

612
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,170
I knew it.

613
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,270
What happened to me?

614
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,610
What is this place?

615
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,810
I can hardly tell the poor little thing.

616
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,970
Oh, I can hardly tell the poor little thing.

617
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,250
This is the land of the dead.

618
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,490
The land of the dead?

619
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,750
Does that mean...

620
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,990
Oh, she could hear her thoughts.

621
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,530
Does that mean I'm dead?

622
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:28,730
Darn!

623
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,710
I forgot there are no secrets in the ghost world!

624
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,470
You can relax.

625
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,410
You're not dead.

626
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,270
But this isn't the first time you've been here, apparently.

627
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:39,590
Really?

628
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,770
I don't remember.

629
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,190
There are no thoughts here.

630
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:44,530
Wait a minute.

631
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:45,910
Maybe I do remember.

632
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,490
Sort of.

633
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:48,850
Wha!

634
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,050
May

635
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,260
I have a birthday song?

636
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,100
My wish this year is to go to Mint's Meet and Greet.

637
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,320
Thank you!

638
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,420
Of course I can sing you.

639
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:07,760
Hold on.

640
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,060
For some reason, it's so loud for me, but it's not so loud
for you.

641
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,780
I will sing you happy birthday.

642
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,440
Hold on, let me...

643
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,640
Let me hold on first.

644
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,400
Happy birthday to you.

645
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:30,080
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear

646
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:50,860
Happy birthday to you I hope your birthday wish comes true
Also I saw someone say that the game is loud?

647
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:51,880
It is?

648
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,000
How about here?

649
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,360
How about here?

650
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,160
Maybe I do remember, sort of.

651
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,420
It's fine?

652
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,880
You do?

653
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,700
It looks like she doesn't remember being saved very well.

654
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,420
Oh, sound good before?

655
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:16,660
Like there?

656
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,660
Hmm, so there's some other dead person out there with
special powers, eh?

657
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,260
Anyway, I don't want to press her if she doesn't remember
dying.

What am I going to do?

671
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,190
Lynn's going to be so mad.

672
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:46,750
Aw.

673
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,090
She's not going to be mad that you got kidnapped.

674
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,430
Well, she's going to be mad that you got kidnapped.

675
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,870
Yeah, she's going to be mad.

676
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,460
She is?

677
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,100
How come?

678
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:03,500
Uh-uh.

679
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,280
Uh-oh.

680
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,840
Because I left it there.

681
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,400
It's probably the music box.

682
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,200
Vanilla look, the membership.

683
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,500
Mm-hmm.

684
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,680
The music box in the park.

685
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,060
This is the music box that, um...

686
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,080
That, uh...

687
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,120
Detective Jowd said that we needed to look into.

688
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,580
That's right, the music box!

689
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,180
Oh, let's ask her.

690
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,160
That music box was hidden in the apartment.

691
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,380
I finally found it with a little bit of luck and courage.

692
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,380
and me.

693
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,840
Actually, just me.

694
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,760
Guess where it was?

695
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,200
I don't know.

696
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:40,740
Where?

697
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,640
I'll pretend I don't...

698
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,800
She can still hear our thoughts.

699
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,540
I'll pretend I don't know.

700
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,500
You know.

701
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:51,900
Tala!

702
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:52,780
Welcome to membership.

703
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,140
You don't have to humor me.

704
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,020
Oops.

705
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,280
So what happened to the music box?

706
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,560
I hid it in the bushes at the park just before it happened.

707
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,440
Just before...

708
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,960
Oh, just before you were kidnapped, huh?

709
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,920
I didn't want the bad man to take it, so I hid it.

710
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,530
I bet it's still there in the park.

711
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:18,350
You did well.

712
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,670
So the music box is in the park.

713
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:21,950
I'd better let Lynn know.

714
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:24,370
Alright, let's ask about Camilla.

715
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,610
This is your old house?

716
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,890
Yep, this is where we lived until five years ago.

717
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:31,990
But now I live with Lynn and Missal.

718
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,770
Lynn is like a big sister to you, isn't she?

719
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,370
Yep, she's a detective, you know.

720
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:38,550
She's a hero.

721
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,210
She is, huh?

722
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,990
Why are you so surprised by that?

723
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,870
By the way, about your father.

724
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:48,930
Is he the justice minister?

725
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,090
My father is... gone.

726
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:55,990
Gone.

727
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:57,470
Maybe he passed away?

728
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:59,630
No, that's not it.

729
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:00,810
My dad...

730
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:02,330
His detective Zhao.

731
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:04,930
He's going to die!

732
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:06,630
And it's all because of me!

733
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,390
What do you mean because of me?

734
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:12,770
Why would you say that?

735
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:14,810
Oh my god, was I right?

736
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:20,150
It's called an ex- Uh-oh.

737
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,030
Uh-oh.

738
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:24,430
It's called an execution.

739
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,570
My dad is a detective.

740
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,210
No way!

741
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,950
Don't tell me your father is Detective Jowd!

742
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,050
That's right.

743
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,770
I so called it.

744
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,650
What in the world?

745
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:50,610
5 years ago something really bad happened Like a scary dream
But it wasn't a dream 5 years ago That murder case

746
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:18,440

guy In the park In the junkyard Was he recreating how How

747
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,880
The mom died?

748
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:24,690
You know?

749
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,390
Oh, maybe.

750
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,930
Or something...

751
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:37,450
Um...

752
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,030
What are you cooking?

753
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,910
Five years ago, that murder case.

754
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:48,490
Incident five years ago.

755
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:58,450
that was my mom's birthday that day my mom and dad were
working and I was home by myself and then I had an idea I

And then it set on fire and everything died.

761
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,870
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

762
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,070
Oh my god.

763
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:57,690
Wait.

764
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,390
Oh my god.

765
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:02,710
Why?

766
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,790
What was the point of all the rest of it?

767
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,610
Why did you set this up?

768
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:11,110
What did you think was going to happen?

769
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:19,890
What was that noise?

770
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,900
I still can't believe it happened.

771
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,740
It wasn't supposed to work like that!

772
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,780
So someone messed with it.

773
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,500
Someone tampered with her contraption.

774
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,080
Hmm, I know that contraption.

775
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,400
Yes, it's exactly what I said, and I know how it was
supposed to work.

776
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,200
Wait, how is it supposed to work?

777
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,600
Wait, I know how it was supposed to work?

778
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,560
It was supposed to...

779
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,300
The poppers.

780
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,780
Yeah, it was supposed to do the poppers.

781
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,300
That's right.

782
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,140
Party poppers and a cake and a birthday message.

783
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,120
Yes, yes, now I remember.

784
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:05,660
Now I remember.

785
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,380
Camilla lost her mom to a TikTok challenge.

786
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,600
Don't say it like that.

787
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,260
Mint hasn't played the game before.

788
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,100
That means she made it.

789
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,560
I haven't seen the creator of Ghost Trick and Mint in the
same room before.

790
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,400
Yes, we redirected the Cupid.

791
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,000
That's right.

792
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,420
That's right.

793
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,420
But also, why was the gun loaded?

794
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,500
My dad told me not to tell anybody.

795
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,460
Just leave it to me, he said.

796
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,920
Aww, poor girl.

797
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,860
My dad wanted to be executed.

798
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,500
He asked them for it.

799
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,280
Okay, name welcome to membership.

800
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,220
But I wanted to tell everybody it was my fault.

801
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,600
My dad said, what I saw was a bad dream.

802
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,640
He told me to forget it.

803
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,880
So unbelievably tragic.

804
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,180
Miracle.

805
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,020
Who doesn't have a loaded gun on their wall?

806
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,200
So true.

807
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,180
I can't believe it.

808
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,980
This little lady is Detective Jowd's daughter.

809
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,110
Girl, your contraption is absolutely killing it.

810
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:17,550
I can't tell her.

811
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:18,490
I just can't tell her.

812
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,950
I can't tell her why she was kidnapped.

813
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:22,950
ZK, thanks for the 10 gifts.

814
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:23,530
Thank you.

815
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,230
Why was I kidnapped?

816
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:36,190

what took you so Wait, sorry, what took you so long?

822
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:34,620
I traveled in the entire town in search of the finest bread
and milk for you, my dear.

823
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,740
But it's late, and all the shops are closed.

824
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,460
We're leaving this place right now.

825
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,720
I don't know, I can't get her voice right anymore.

826
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:45,700
What?

827
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,840
But he's not here yet.

828
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,240
If we couldn't meet at the restaurant, weren't we supposed
to meet here?

829
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,100
Yes, and he is the one who chose this location.

830
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,240
I don't like this one bit.

831
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,080
I can never unhear Shaggy.

832
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:04,160
I think I'm leaning more into the Shaggy since I can't stop
it.

833
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,200
It's just happening.

834
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,580
Let Shaggy take over, okay?

835
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,900
Let, let, kind of sounds like Shaggy from Skiba.

836
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,100
Just let the Shaggy take over, okay?

837
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,040
We have to run around doing all this extra work for the sake
of his deal.

838
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,220
Be quiet.

839
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,560
It can't be held.

840
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,320
This place is too dangerous.

841
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,520
I told you, my sixth sense is very strong.

842
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,920
Oh, she senses me.

843
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,960
As you wish me, UD.

844
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,400
I feel it.

845
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,840
I sense something here in this room.

846
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,120
It's me.

847
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,320
It's me.

848
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,860
Is somebody there?

849
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,180
Can you hear me?

850
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,620
She's talking to me!

851
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,120
She's talking to me!

852
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,040
She's talking to me, you guys.

853
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,340
She's talking to me, straight to me, straight to me.

854
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,260
I can sense your presence, you know.

855
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,660
The next time I sense you, this child will...

856
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,600
This child will die.

857
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:14,300
Remember that.

858
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,620
Oh my god.

859
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,040
Okay.

860
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,560
I'm just obsessed with you.

861
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,220
All right.

862
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,080
We're leaving.

863
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:30,470
Pardon me, little lady.

864
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:34,990
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

865
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:39,390
Oh, recently discovered VTubers and I love your streams.

866
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:40,390
Really?

867
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,770
Thank you so much.

868
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:42,730
Thanks, do guy.

869
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,070
Thanks for the super chat.

870
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:46,410
Like soinks mint.

871
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:47,850
We gotta get out of here.

872
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:51,370
Okay.

873
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,350
All of a sudden I'm left behind alone.

874
00:53:56,350 --> 00:54:00,890
Alone in the room that stole that little lady's smile away
five years ago.

875
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:05,530
The little lady is gone now, leaving me with only a few new
facts.

876
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:09,430
A few very heavy, very sad facts.

877
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,550
Does Lynn know about all this?

878
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:14,470
Bro, raggy.

879
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:17,710
One other thing stands out in my mind.

880
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,470
I can sense your presence.

881
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,470
The sum of that kidnapper's final words.

882
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:26,130
Do those two know?

883
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:30,530
Do the kidnappers know about the powers of the dead?

884
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:33,350
Would you spare the girl for a scooby snack?

885
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,700
Bada, bada, bada, bada, bada.

886
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,720
Yay!

887
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,120
Cleared the 1225 challenge.

888
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:47,860
It's crazy that all of this happens in just like 15 minutes.

889
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,560
Oh my gosh, Camilla is so cute!

890
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,460
Continue playing.

891
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,340
Of course.

892
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,940
I don't know what chapter we're on now.

893
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:58,540
Oh!

894
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,100
Chapter 12.

895
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,120
Yeah.

896
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:04,880
40 minutes late.

897
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,880
Now I feel so lost.

898
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,780
I can catch you up.

899
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:10,640
Here.

900
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,300
Read this.

901
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,180
Hold on.

902
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,980
Hold on.

903
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,520
I'm going to eat.

904
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,420
You read it.

905
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,800
Someone read it out loud.

906
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:37,790
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

907
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:40,590
Boop, boop.

908
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,160
Welcome to why you're stuck here.

909
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,540
All your earthly possessions now belong to Vita Wars.

910
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,580
You've missed your chance to run.

911
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,050
Thanks for your super tie.

912
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:05,510
I'm glad, am I glad she's trapped in there?

913
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:06,570
And that we're trapped out there?

914
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,010
And that she's the daughter?

915
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:09,250
And that we're trapped out there?

916
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,030
And that we're in there?

917
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:14,450
I just remembered we're out here.

918
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:16,870
Where's Miss Camilla?

919
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:21,790
Thank you.

920
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,150
What do you call a ghost ad?

921
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:26,730
A transparent.

922
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:30,570
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

923
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:31,090
Get it?

924
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:32,310
Because he's transparent.

925
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:33,530
He's a ghost.

926
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:37,270
Looks like the kidnappers made a big mistake.

927
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:38,350
The girl in the trunk.

928
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:39,530
Oh, thank you.

929
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,290
You literally said a super chat?

930
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,170
You said a super chat?

931
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:46,830
Oh, fuck.

932
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:51,030
of what's on the screen.

933
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:53,150
Okay, I'll read it.

934
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:57,730
It looks like the kidnappers made a big mistake.

935
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:58,690
Now I can't.

936
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,190
You said to read it out loud.

937
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:03,350
Okay, sorry, hold on.

938
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:03,990
Let me take a sip.

939
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:08,460
Okay.

940
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,860
It looks like the kidnappers made a big mistake.

941
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,840
The girl in the trunk was Detective Jowd's daughter,
Camilla.

942
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,560
Not the minister's daughter.

943
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,500
Dun, dun, dun.

944
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,140
Oh, what is going on here?

945
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,060
What are you guys doing?

946
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,340
When I got back to the Justice Minister's office, things
were getting even more out of hand.

947
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,820
The devastated man was being grilled by the fiery detective
lady.

948
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,020
D-D-B-B!

949
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,900
Thanks for the money.

950
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,440
Oh, that's what she's doing.

951
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,640
She's going off on him.

952
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,040
I told Lynn what I found out about the kidnapping.

953
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,100
That it wasn't the Justice Minister's daughter who had been
abducted.

954
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,480
That the kidnappers had been holed up in...

955
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,240
and Camilla's old house, and that they sensed my presence
and were already gone.

956
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,540
This is a good recap of what just happened.

957
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,360
I hope this caught you up.

958
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,440
But Camilla, why do they have Camilla?

959
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,480
Her father isn't the stupid old justice minister?

960
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,920
I think the stupid old part is a little uncalled for.

961
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,000
Looks like the kidnappers made a mistake somehow.

962
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:18,980
The poor girl kidnapped for the ransom of her own father's
execution.

963
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,480
That is actually...

964
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,280
I did not think about that.

965
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,680
That's actually really messed up.

966
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,980
That's actually so messed up.

967
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,740
I missed the last stream.

968
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,960
How long did it take Min to get past the minister's puzzle?

969
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:34,940
I don't remember.

970
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,900
I think about each chapter has taken me like an hour or so.

971
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:40,880
Or a little longer.

972
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,320
I also talk.

973
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,940
But this is really messed up.

974
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,620
It's just too much!

975
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,960
It's a cruel twist of fate.

976
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:49,680
I agree.

977
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:51,480
That just ain't wrong.

978
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:59,320
and then there are those other twists too like the
kidnappers winding up and and winding up in and using

979
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:08,100
Camilla's old house as their hideout there's no way it could
be just a coincidence and them sensing my presence they seem

980
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:17,060
to know about the powers of the dead I just don't understand
any of it I think you're generally decently quick yay thank

981
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:23,120
you I told you before detective I want you to stand back.

982
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:25,180
Bang!

983
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,580
Minus 1 HP, minus 1 HP, minus 1 HP.

984
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,500
Who cares about distance at a time like this?

985
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:33,080
Look, Mr. Minister.

986
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,420
It wasn't your daughter that was kidnapped.

987
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,820
Don't try to pretend you didn't hear what we were saying.

988
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:40,860
Ah!

989
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,560
How can you bel- how can I believe in you?

990
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,860
I'm a realist.

991
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:47,700
Please!

992
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:48,640
Minus 1 HP.

993
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,360
If you don't believe what we said see for yourself.

994
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,600
Just call home and... I tried calling a hundred times.

995
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:57,900
My wife won't answer.

996
00:59:59,460 --> 00:59:59,980
She won't?

997
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,100
It's complicated.

998
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:07,020
Oh, why does life have to be such a complicated thing?

999
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,920
I don't remember the voice I gave him before.

1000
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:14,500
And I feel like I remember Lynn being British, but I think
that was just a Mandela effect.

1001
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:19,620
But if she doesn't have it, doesn't answer, doesn't that
mean everything's normal?

1002
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:30,200
prove it and everyone knows ghosts aren't real why would you
say that what what why would you say that

1003
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:48,460
excuse you and i'm being watched i can't have the police go
check for me besides if the execution isn't carried out

1004
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:56,980
tonight the hostage will be killed what difference does it
make that it's not my daughter i guess that's kind of true

1005
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,840
Woo-wee!

1006
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,580
That's quite a pickle, Mr. Minister.

1007
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,200
Quite a pickle.

1008
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:03,880
Oh, my God.

1009
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,780
Here comes the Elvis guy.

1010
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,560
I forgot his name.

1011
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:13,740
Miss me, baby.

1012
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,840
Oh, Inspector Cabanella.

1013
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,060
I thought it was like a pasta.

1014
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,880
I was like Carbonaro, but it didn't seem right.

1015
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,560
He's so cool.

1016
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,720
Ooh, ooh.

1017
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:33,900
Oh, I have a little rapport for you, Mr. Minister.

1018
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:38,800
Oh, my goodness.

1019
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,460
If you guys don't bow that deep when you greet me.

1020
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:47,170
Hmm.

1021
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:51,670
The escaped prisoner has been apprehended.

1022
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:54,590
I thought you might like to see him, so here he is.

1023
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:55,870
Wait, he's here?

1024
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:57,490
Oh.

1025
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:59,470
Come on in.

1026
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:02,610
Oh my god, he's just here!

1027
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:04,550
Detective Jowd?

1028
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:09,870
Detective Jowd, I'm so sorry, I tried.

1029
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:14,390
I'm a nerd, you think I could bend like that?

1030
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:18,530
Start, start, start stretching.

1031
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:22,310
Wilson Channel, welcome to membership, thank you!

1032
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:26,290
I know that you're innocent, I just can't prove it.

1033
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,710
I'm so sorry.

1034
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:43,390
Lynn please don't apologize to me the reason I don't give
him a voice is I think he's just too cool for I can't do it

1035
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:51,830
justice you know the beautiful love between a teacher and
student it brings a tear to my eye

1036
01:02:55,350 --> 01:03:04,550
trick time oh what are they saying you knew didn't you
inspector Carbonara but The execution was tonight.

1037
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:07,910
It's the Giga Chen.

1038
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,410
Give him snake voice.

1039
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:14,530
I was planning to doggies up for the meet and greet, but
alas.

1040
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:15,590
Ah, man.

1041
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:16,410
It's okay.

1042
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:17,090
I'm the maid.

1043
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:18,390
I have to be bowing to you.

1044
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:19,750
You guys don't bow to me.

1045
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:22,370
I bow to you guys.

1046
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,220
Even if you're just wisps.

1047
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,740
You're all Goshujin-sama and Ojo-sama wisps.

1048
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,280
Sorry, I was chewing.

1049
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:57,700
I don't believe I had any obligation to tell you.

1050
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:58,840
What a jerk.

1051
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,380
And you're fine with this?

1052
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,300
I mean, you know as well as I do.

1053
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:07,560
Detective Jowd could never have done such a thing.

1054
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,500
No, come on, baby.

1055
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:14,920
I know no such thing.

1056
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:15,820
Huh?

1057
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,660
I know two things.

1058
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,580
Every time it elongates his words, I want to, like, say it
like a sheep.

1059
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,840
Two things to be true, and two things only.

1060
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:34,520
One, he was given the death penalty, and two, he tried to
escape.

1061
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:37,740
What else could I do but haul him in, baby?

1062
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:40,900
But he's an innocent man!

1063
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,420
If that's the case, why did you bring him here?

1064
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,340
Whatever do you mean, young lady?

1065
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,080
He escaped from prison, right?

1066
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,760
So why didn't you just take him back to the prison?

1067
01:04:55,080 --> 01:05:08,320
you only brought him here to brag about your accomplishment
isn't that right inspector oh Elvis sheep with all these

1068
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:16,540
cool character voices have you ever considered being a
dungeon master I don't I've never ever once had the thought

1069
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:24,380
for your own selfish reasons oh yes call them out call them
out this Guy's a jerk.

1070
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,320
So are all those rumors about you true?

1071
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,500
That the only thing you care about is a spotless record?

1072
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:35,380
Is that more important to you than saving a friend?

1073
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:37,400
Shots.

1074
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,980
Everybody has certain principles they care and to go back
on.

1075
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,320
Including me.

1076
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,940
You'll understand that someday, baby.

1077
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,940
I don't like him.

1078
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:55,840
That's enough, Lin.

1079
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:56,980
Oh.

1080
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,740
Talk to, like, a snake, right?

1081
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,240
But Detective Jowd!

1082
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,400
I'm a death...

1083
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,280
It doesn't fit him.

1084
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,420
I'm a death row in me.

1085
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,480
Who escaped from prison.

1086
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,000
It just doesn't fit him at all.

1087
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,540
This is how it should be.

1088
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:17,700
But...

1089
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,820
The instant fold.

1090
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:25,860
Oh, my ghost!

1091
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,520
Oh, I don't want to talk to you.

1092
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:46,970
oh my god we can talk to everybody here it's kind of crazy
you know we'll start with the we'll start with this guy my

1093
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:54,950
poor amelie is she all right actually the girl who was
kidnapped is named camilla why is a dream talking to me in

1094
01:06:54,950 --> 01:07:04,410
my head again wait a minute amelie wait they all can
communicate they can all go into the death area together

1095
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:05,630
Interesting.

1096
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:08,530
Could that be the Amelie next door?

1097
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,170
Yes, I think so.

1098
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:14,810
Wow, I didn't know the justice minister lived next door.

1099
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,070
No, not me.

1100
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:17,790
My wife.

1101
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:19,650
It's complicated.

1102
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:24,310
Yeah, I bet it would be pretty hard to admit she...

1103
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:27,050
Wait, there's no secrets in the ghost world, Sissel!

1104
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,010
Ghost Skype.

1105
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:31,970
Oh.

1106
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:34,650
Sissel.

1107
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:36,870
He never learns.

1108
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:37,650
Actually, you know what?

1109
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:39,050
Let everybody know.

1110
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,120
The minister's wife ran away on him.

1111
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:54,000
Why was she so happy about that?

1112
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:01,930
Yo, is this Professor Layton versus Ace Attorney?

1113
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:04,510
Yes.

1114
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:08,670
Maybe they grew apart.

1115
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:09,890
What, with him being so busy?

1116
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:11,770
Yeah, I bet you're right.

1117
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:16,750
Please stop gossiping about me inside my own head!

1118
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:26,250
According to what I heard, Amelie was supposed to go to some
sort of lesson tonight.

1119
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:30,010
Those horrible kidnappers!

1120
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:31,870
They were lying in wait for her!

1121
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:34,630
But Amelie didn't go out after all.

1122
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:35,710
She couldn't.

1123
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:37,970
She had a fever.

1124
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:39,450
Huh.

1125
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:42,390
And so the kidnappers grabbed Camilla by mistake.

1126
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,170
mistake instead?

1127
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:44,510
Apparently.

1128
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:47,430
Emily and Camilla are about the same age.

1129
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:51,210
The kidnappers must have gotten the two of them mixed up.

1130
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:54,990
It's my fault.

1131
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:59,490
If I hadn't asked Camilla to do that errand for me, this
never would have happened.

1132
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:01,290
Oh, right.

1133
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:03,230
You asked her to bring the music box.

1134
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:04,830
Camilla.

1135
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:07,490
Aw, it's not your fault.

1136
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:09,150
It's not your fault.

1137
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,490
Alright, let's go talk to Jowd.

1138
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,970
Mr. Ghost, do we meet again?

1139
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:16,110
I hear something happen.

1140
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:17,470
Something about it kidnapping.

1141
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:18,610
It's your daughter!

1142
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:23,750
Some kidnappers are saying they abducted the Justice
Minister's daughter.

1143
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:26,110
That's terrible.

1144
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:27,430
What's their demand?

1145
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:33,290
The carrying out of your execution tonight.

1146
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:35,350
Ha ha ha!

1147
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:38,030
I had no idea I was so hated.

1148
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:40,730
But the Minister doesn't have to worry.

1149
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:52,630
die and it's all over very simple no what about your
daughter it's not that simple why not because it isn't

1150
01:09:52,630 --> 01:10:03,510
really the minister's daughter who got kidnapped it's
camilla you just spat food all over if you could choose to

1151
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:11,750
someone's life with wait choose to what with ghost trick but
in exchange they could hear what you think when you talk to

1152
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,710
them What would you do, Ghost Maid?

1153
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,770
What, like, save someone's life with the ghost trick?

1154
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:20,990
Um...

1155
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,680
Yeah, save.

1156
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:41,950
But, like, what if the death is, like, really interesting?

1157
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:43,710
Really creative.

1158
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:45,110
Kind of, like, the death contraption.

1159
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:48,530
Can we hear your thoughts?

1160
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:50,590
What would you want to hear, huh?

1161
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:57,470
What would you... What do you think that I think, in my
head, that I don't say out loud.

1162
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:59,310
99% of the time.

1163
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:04,730
What do you think that I'm thinking about, Snake?

1164
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:06,590
Lude thoughts.

1165
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:09,790
Exactly my point.

1166
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:13,650
What do you think that I'm thinking about that I do not say
90...

1167
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:14,190
You know what?

1168
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:14,590
I'll even...

1169
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:15,330
I might drop it a little.

1170
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:17,090
95% of the time.

1171
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,910
I have nothing to lose, man, with a young daughter.

1172
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:23,870
I know, right?

1173
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:28,940
Hmm.

1174
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,160
Nerd stuff.

1175
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,960
You know deep down that you're actually cute.

1176
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:37,520
I wish.

1177
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:40,020
I wish I could agree with you there.

1178
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:47,600
I wish I could agree with you there.

1179
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:54,760
Anyway.

1180
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,100
Camilla.

1181
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:58,740
I checked it out for myself.

1182
01:11:59,240 --> 01:11:59,740
I'm positive.

1183
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:01,560
No, it can't be.

1184
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,840
By the way, Camilla told me something interesting.

1185
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,280
She said the one who killed her mother five years ago...

1186
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,900
...was Camilla herself!

1187
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:14,280
What?

1188
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,520
What are you talking about?

1189
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,380
Don't listen to him!

1190
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,440
I'm the one who shot her!

1191
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,920
I'm the one who shot Alma!

1192
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:25,460
And when I'm executed tonight, that will be the end of it.

1193
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:28,220
Camilla won't have to suffer anymore after tonight.

1194
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:30,120
She's suffering because...

1195
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,420
Camilla, she was a baby!

1196
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,140
What do you think she's going to get the death penalty?

1197
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,260
This guy is so backwards.

1198
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:41,740
For a capable detective, you say some incredibly misguided
things.

1199
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,400
Yeah, her dad is going to die, and that means her dad and
her mom are going to be dead.

1200
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,400
How is that going to end her suffering?

1201
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,900
This guy is so stupid.

1202
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,770
You dying isn't going to end that girl's suffering.

1203
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:06,890
It'll just bring her new suffering.

1204
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:14,390
the only person's pain this execution is going to ease is
yours

1205
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:33,220
do you think the lamp was the mom the lamp at the very
beginning but also facts sisal facts do you think the lamp

1206
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:42,500
do you think the mom is what protected is what protected
Camilla from dying before mmm

1207
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,240
That's what I was thinking.

1208
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,180
Great minds.

1209
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:52,180
Great minds.

1210
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:54,740
But I'm just cooking.

1211
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,640
No confirming or denying.

1212
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,720
We're cooking together, everybody.

1213
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:00,560
Is it true?

1214
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:01,940
What Camilla said?

1215
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,720
Why don't you tell us what you know?

1216
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,160
The murder five years ago.

1217
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,260
To be honest, I still don't understand what happened that
day.

1218
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,020
It was my wife's almost birthday.

1219
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,740
The lamp is me.

1220
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:19,760
I'm the game.

1221
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:22,980
I believe you being quake.

1222
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:23,820
Sorry.

1223
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:24,880
Being quake.

1224
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:28,900
We came home from work.

1225
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,160
And she went in first.

1226
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:31,340
Oh yeah, that's true.

1227
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:33,020
She did die a long time ago.

1228
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:35,140
And he said that...

1229
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,500
Or the lamp said that...

1230
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,460
You only get...

1231
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:42,400
But what if that's not actually the case?

1232
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,900
What if that's not actually the case?

1233
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,100
What if the lamp lied?

1234
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:55,520
What if the lamp lied so that we would solve the case
tonight?

1235
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:57,120
So that we would have a motive?

1236
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:01,420
Because the lamp seemed to know a lot.

1237
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,920
But if they were only around for a little bit of time, they
wouldn't know so much.

1238
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,960
What if the lamp is the mom trying to save the dad?

1239
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:17,940
Because she knows that it wasn't him.

1240
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,820
Why would a lamp lie?

1241
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:33,060
I looked for the shooter, but there was nobody to be found.

1242
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,680
There was nobody there besides Alma and Camilla.

1243
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:37,060
Just the two of them.

1244
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,120
So the little lady's mother died right in front of her.

1245
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,140
So sad.

1246
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:44,940
That's so horrible.

1247
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,600
Camilla told me about it.

1248
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:51,760
She was crying.

1249
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:55,840
Lamp has grandpa voice, though.

1250
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:56,960
You're so right.

1251
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:58,620
What was I thinking?

1252
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,260
The lamps of Grandpa.

1253
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,560
I have a big question, though.

1254
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:05,480
Who is Cicel?

1255
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,100
I know, we still don't know.

1256
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,940
But we gotta get to the music box, and then we'll figure it
all out.

1257
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:15,380
She said the contraption she made did something it wasn't
supposed to.

1258
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:17,280
Made an impossible move.

1259
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,820
An impossible move.

1260
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:25,540
I love, I love, you know what, maybe Cicel needs the snake
voice, since he talks like snake.

1261
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,540
The powers of the dead.

1262
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,200
It's been five years since then.

1263
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,820
I stopped thinking about it.

1264
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,140
I shot Alma.

1265
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,720
There's no other explanation.

1266
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,880
That's what I'd convince everyone of.

1267
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:38,960
Even me.

1268
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:44,560
But tonight, you showed up and gave me an explanation I
never would have thought of before.

1269
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:47,120
The powers of the dead, right?

1270
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:53,320
That day in that room, powers that I didn't understand were
at work.

1271
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:56,080
And if that's the case, it clears up...

1272
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:09,300
all the mysteries so a ghost that doesn't save lives but
kills lives oh my god an

1273
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:27,320
evil ghost maybe not all there are a couple of other people
who know about those powers her is somebody there can you

1274
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:38,400
hear me I can sense your presence you know the kidnappers
the kidnappers knew wait the kidnappers who abducted camilla

1275
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:48,480
knew about those powers this is no ordinary kidnapping it
looks like my wife's case isn't coming to an end after all

1276
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:59,260
i'm the only one who thought it was yeah liquid sizzle
detective out there's still time before dawn a little anyway

1277
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:11,280
how about you see this case through to the end before you
die I only know one other ghost mint what have you been up

1278
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,420
to on the side well

1279
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:35,400
you know a little here a little kind of like you know a
little uh this and that right and left up and down hmm that

1280
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:49,640
sock that went missing last week on the dark web being sold
uh you know that cake you were saving but disappeared all of

1281
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:58,000
a sudden hmm yeah you ate it but i possess you when you're
dead.

1282
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,220
Officer, there's ghosts right here.

1283
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,200
No, no, no!

1284
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:04,580
I'm innocent.

1285
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:07,700
No, no, no, no.

1286
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,380
I'm innocent, I promise.

1287
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,660
I didn't do a thing.

1288
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,320
I didn't miss this.

1289
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,280
It wasn't me.

1290
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,040
It wasn't me.

1291
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:22,840
An impossible move.

1292
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:27,200
Camilla was a quiet little girl, but she was good with her
hands.

1293
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:30,820
She was a little genius.

1294
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,860
She's a little genius.

1295
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,900
At making elaborate toys and contraptions.

1296
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,540
But there were two very strange points about that
contraption.

1297
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,880
No, don't put me next to the police!

1298
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,740
The first was, of course, the firing of that gun.

1299
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:52,020
Right.

1300
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:55,260
That was an antique gun I had on display for years.

1301
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,960
So it wasn't part of the little lady's original design.

1302
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,260
Of course it wasn't!

1303
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:07,100
It was supposed to be a surprise for her mother's birthday!

1304
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,920
And the other strange point was the movement of that cupid.

1305
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:13,540
Cupid.

1306
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,400
Yeah, the poppers were supposed to go up.

1307
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:28,260
It was supposed to shoot its arrow without turning around.

1308
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,080
Why did it turn around?

1309
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:36,990
Just like that.

1310
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:46,690
Maybe, maybe we avoid having contraptions with using fire,
you know, and that girl's name, Albert Einstein.

1311
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:54,010
Somebody made a change to the contraptions design and then
manipulated it.

1312
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:58,870
I don't know what to say.

1313
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:02,750
I didn't have time to think things through then.

1314
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:05,530
All I knew was I had to protect Camilla.

1315
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:09,530
I made a small adjustment to the scene and turned to myself.

1316
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:10,110
off it.

1317
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:13,390
Adjustment to the scene.

1318
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:15,970
What kind of an adjustment?

1319
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:17,970
The gun, of course.

1320
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:19,450
The gun, eh?

1321
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:20,810
Come to think of it.

1322
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:24,210
Oh yeah, it was missing.

1323
01:21:27,610 --> 01:21:28,990
There was no gun there.

1324
01:21:29,170 --> 01:21:30,590
Just a picture hanging on the wall.

1325
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:32,430
Of course not.

1326
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:35,730
Because I secretly switched the gun out of that frame with
the picture.

1327
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:37,350
Oh.

1328
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:42,330
I didn't believe what she told me about her contraption.

1329
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:43,670
Why did you believe her?

1330
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:45,750
But one thing was for certain.

1331
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:49,090
That gun was still smoking.

1332
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:52,270
So that gun really did you, Alma.

1333
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:55,370
I hid the gun before I went to the police.

1334
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,030
You hid it?

1335
01:21:57,490 --> 01:22:01,230
I put it in a wooden box and gave it to a certain detective.

1336
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:03,590
Me?

1337
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:05,530
Or her?

1338
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:07,170
Wait, is it in the music box?

1339
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:09,750
You mean...

1340
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:09,990
Ah!

1341
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,180
Still thinks it's a music box!

1342
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,980
So that's... Oh my gosh, you just gave her a gun.

1343
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:18,720
Dang.

1344
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,320
So that's what was in the box, huh?

1345
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:25,820
I got a different murder weapon ready to give to the police.

1346
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,360
My own pistol.

1347
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,000
And I did a few other... But...

1348
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:32,200
No, that doesn't make any sense.

1349
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:38,080
If you give your own pistol to the police, the bullets
wouldn't match up.

1350
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,980
You said it was an antique gun.

1351
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,920
That's the evidence that you need!

1352
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,420
The bullets wouldn't match up!

1353
01:22:52,220 --> 01:23:01,400
keep reading read his line oh and i did a few other things
to make it look good i won't go into the details when i was

1354
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:07,740
all done i turned myself in oh he said that it matched oh he
did wait Huh?

1355
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,760
Maybe he shot the corpse?

1356
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,920
Oh, we did a few other things.

1357
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:25,750
That's... what...

1358
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:26,590
That's...

1359
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:36,550
That...

1360
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:37,310
How could you?

1361
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,990
Like, even if someone...

1362
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:48,530
Even if someone were dead...

1363
01:23:48,530 --> 01:23:52,530
If they were, like, my husband or wife, I wouldn't be able
to reshoot them at all.

1364
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:53,430
What?

1365
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:53,750
What?

1366
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:09,930
oh my god so anyway I started blasting oh my god when I was
all done I turned myself in

1367
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:26,370
wow that that's that's a lot damn I thought I was on to
something too I was just like damn it detective Jowd why'd

1368
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:34,670
you have to be so thorough I was like just go find the
bullet it'll be fine Damn it!

1369
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,610
Detective Jowd is what you told us just now true.

1370
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:51,060
Yes, of course.

1371
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:56,020
In that case, there's still time!

1372
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:57,900
Still time.

1373
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:01,620
Time to solve the case that started five years ago.

1374
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,960
You didn't do it, Detective Jowd.

1375
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:08,280
Camilla didn't do it either.

1376
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:13,940
So the true perpetrator is still out there, and I'm going to
prove it.

1377
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,300
For Camilla's sake!

1378
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:18,100
Whoa.

1379
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:24,570
That sounds wonderful.

1380
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:28,950
Yeah!

1381
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:31,190
He's on our side now!

1382
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:34,290
Thank you, Detective Jowd.

1383
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:38,490
Lynn, where is that music box now?

1384
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:40,570
In Temsik Park.

1385
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:41,530
Camilla left it there.

1386
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:43,610
Wait, don't just yell this out to everybody.

1387
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:45,270
We don't know who we can trust.

1388
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:48,050
That gun is important evidence.

1389
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:49,370
You'd better go pick it up.

1390
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:51,570
Don't just tell everybody!

1391
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:53,410
Yes, sir.

1392
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:54,810
I'll go right now.

1393
01:25:57,330 --> 01:25:59,350
Cicel, take care of Detective Jowd.

1394
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:03,370
And do something about the kidnapping so we can get the
minister on our side.

1395
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:08,170
And yet again, I say, easy enough for you to say.

1396
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:20,210
uh is he is that anybody are they not going to be like oh
what what was that what it's going on deal me the deal mr

1397
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:29,670
death row and mate a little change in plans my daughter has
been kidnapped i can't just go off to die without doing

1398
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:41,010
something but you're in our custody don't forget it back at
the prison everybody's you with a special seat just for you,

1399
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:41,230
Rebbe.

1400
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:46,410
Then I guess we'd better prove my innocence on the double.

1401
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:48,470
On the double, is it?

1402
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:51,390
You sound so determined, my old friend.

1403
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:52,970
Hmm.

1404
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:55,490
I want to save Camilla.

1405
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:57,110
In more ways than one.

1406
01:26:58,010 --> 01:26:58,330
Yeah!

1407
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:00,350
And that's all there is to it.

1408
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:02,150
Didn't the chair blow up?

1409
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:02,670
It did.

1410
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:03,890
The chair did blow up.

1411
01:27:03,970 --> 01:27:05,190
So what are they going to do now?

1412
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:07,490
Oh my god.

1413
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:08,810
They're going to put...

1414
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:22,070
the chicken I see my old friend in more ways than what what
say you mr.

1415
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:25,550
minister maybe have your decision please please mr.

1416
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:33,070
minister should the execution be carried out tonight as
planned or should we hold off and wait for this important

1417
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:40,510
evidence to come in oh it's not your daughter The order
still stands.

1418
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:42,310
This guy sucks.

1419
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:44,410
We should have never saved him.

1420
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:48,170
Poison chicken.

1421
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:51,730
Bring the prisoner back immediately and resume its
enforcement.

1422
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:54,810
No!

1423
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,280
As you wish your excellent save.

1424
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:02,600
Oh, my guide.

1425
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:04,660
Please don't bow down to me.

1426
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,040
And especially not that low.

1427
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:12,310
In that case, can I...

1428
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:15,230
have one of your booze?

1429
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:17,090
Boy!

1430
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:45,020
Arrange for a prison van to pick him up.

1431
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:48,440
Oh my goodness, I always have boo on the mind.

1432
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:50,380
Would you be so kind?

1433
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:51,480
Yes sir!

1434
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,720
Hoop, hoop, hoop.

1435
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:58,490
Where did that come from?

1436
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:01,750
Are you just gonna stare at me?

1437
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:02,810
What are you obsessed with me?

1438
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:05,630
The van should take about 10 minutes, I'm guessing.

1439
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:08,010
Your escape tonight was brilliant.

1440
01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:13,770
Will you show me another miracle in these last few minutes
of yours, Mr. Deathrow inmate?

1441
01:29:16,570 --> 01:29:19,510
Q Amelia, thanks for a month, VTuber.

1442
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:21,670
Thank you!

1443
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:23,630
Let's see.

1444
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:26,110
We gotta show a miracle, huh?

1445
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:33,530
glad to see Detective Jowd all fired up now I feel like I'm
under the gun here even if Lynn does come through with the

1446
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:40,690
proof of Jowd's innocence it will be meaningless if Jowd or
Camilla dies I've got to do something about that kidnapping

1447
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:52,610
somehow maybe I should ask for some advice from the capable
detective here or we spear him or we spear him let's go get

1448
01:29:52,610 --> 01:29:58,850
inside this guy's head um excuse me Mr. Minister I'm gonna
haunt you until the day you die.

1449
01:29:59,390 --> 01:30:01,430
I can't hear you, la la la la.

1450
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:06,430
I'm sure you've heard everything we've been saying.

1451
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:09,570
Are you telling me you don't believe any of it?

1452
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:12,210
Let me speak plainly.

1453
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:13,230
I don't trust you.

1454
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:15,770
But there's somebody else whom I trust even less.

1455
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:16,850
Oh yeah?

1456
01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:17,830
Who's that?

1457
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:19,290
Me!

1458
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:21,450
I can't explain your existence.

1459
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:22,790
It's not normal.

1460
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:24,830
But I'm pretty abnormal myself.

1461
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,650
are a figment of my imagination.

1462
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:28,570
A delusion.

1463
01:30:29,570 --> 01:30:30,190
Oh my god.

1464
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:31,610
The voices.

1465
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:34,470
Would you listen to a delusion?

1466
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:38,630
To be honest, I have no idea what you're talking about.

1467
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:42,330
I got the bit about you not trusting me, though.

1468
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:53,140
Most likely, the minister won't stop the execution.

1469
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:54,720
The voices.

1470
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,320
The Lulu is the Salulu.

1471
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:57,860
The Salulu.

1472
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:07,240
not as long as there's any small chance his daughter is the
one who was kidnapped but she isn't the one I'm sure of it

1473
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:18,180
well it would be great if we could prove that to the
minister prove it how we have to get them to call we have to

1474
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:26,260
get the wife to call him I doubt his wife is ever going to
answer that phone if we call from here if we call from here

1475
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:28,980
right But a telephone works in both directions.

1476
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:30,560
Yes, yes, yes.

1477
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:32,620
What are you saying?

1478
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:36,780
What I'm saying is only family members can solve a family
problem.

1479
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:38,600
Hey, Mr. Ghost?

1480
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:40,260
Yes.

1481
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,640
I have to admit, I don't like depending on others.

1482
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:47,260
But you're the only one who can change the situation.

1483
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,200
Gee, detective.

1484
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:53,200
For these past five years, Camilla is the only thing that
kept me going.

1485
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:55,940
I can't go meekly to the chair now.

1486
01:31:57,220 --> 01:32:09,220
I hate to ask this but would you mind saving me I'll try the
key to getting the justice minister to stop the execution is

1487
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:18,100
his wife and daughter but is there a way oh my gosh we're
going back to the lady wait can I no it won't let me go

1488
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:29,560
anywhere else okay time to can I knock this off spray little
water pitcher just saved the justice minister's life he

1489
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:35,440
drank all the water so now it's empty I think he should get
it refilled you never know when another fit may visit so

1490
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:42,980
true hanging around here won't change anything I've got ten
minutes before the prison van shows up I could just do

1491
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:50,440
something about the kidnapping in those ten minutes I guess
the telephone lines are my only hope okay let's make it the

1492
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:55,640
best ten minutes of our lives baby ladies red

1493
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:01,060
Stay hydrated, everyone.

1494
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:12,230
Just as I thought.

1495
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,660
This little girl is safe in her bed.

1496
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:24,940
She's so cute.

1497
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:26,420
She reminds me of...

1498
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:27,200
Did I say this last time?

1499
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,500
She reminds me of Beatrice from Re-Zero.

1500
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:30,620
Murder.

1501
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:31,700
Execution.

1502
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:32,560
Jail break.

1503
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:33,120
Betrayal.

1504
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:33,580
And now kill.

1505
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:34,080
Kidnapping.

1506
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:38,640
This last link in this long chain of a sad fate lit a fire
in Jowd's heart.

1507
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:39,340
I did.

1508
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:46,200
And the chance to turn it all around is right here in this
room.

1509
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:50,600
You guys, if you ever think...

1510
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:56,840
If you ever think I'm not sincere, I always think the same
things.

1511
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:11,250
I always think the same things over and over again.

1512
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,420
I love this music so much

1513
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:37,460
I'm getting a strange premonition Everything that happened
so far tonight Has related back to me in some way And I bet

1514
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:48,740
this mistaken Written abduction does too I'm so curious who
Sissel is Oh that was the end of the chapter Oh,

1515
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:49,200
interesting.

1516
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:51,080
We just got this illustration now.

1517
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:54,600
Even though Cabanella tall and lovely.

1518
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:01,740
Well, one of those words describes him as definitely not
tall.

1519
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:03,660
Okay.

1520
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:05,800
Continue playing.

1521
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:06,240
Yeah.

1522
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,760
It's only been an hour and a half.

1523
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,660
That was a shorter chapter, wasn't it?

1524
01:35:18,210 --> 01:35:20,630
I visited the novelist's apartment again.

1525
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:31,640
I'm hoping to be able to do something about this mistaken
identity kidnapping as long as there's any possibility that

1526
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:38,460
it could be his own daughter who was kidnapped I doubt the
justice minister will call off the execution tonight I'm

1527
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:41,700
studying so keep me company me though I'll be here

1528
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:54,800
the key to dispelling the minister's doubts is not now in
bed coughing and I need to use this key and i need to use

1529
01:35:54,800 --> 01:36:05,830
this key before that prison van arrives to pick up our death
row inmate oh my god there she's back she's back baby

1530
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:21,290
this poor girl she's so sick my darling angel oh just listen
to that cough you naughty thing did you leave your nice warm

1531
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:33,450
bed to go out into the night to play a daughter after my own
heart but I must confess I didn't even notice you were gone

1532
01:36:33,450 --> 01:36:46,160
that's that's not anything to brag about I didn't go out to
play I went to buy Papa a birthday present he said he wanted

1533
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:53,620
a new lighter okay but that's no reason to go out this late
at night.

1534
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:57,760
But my fever finally went down.

1535
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,620
I could barely move before that.

1536
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:07,940
But look what it brought you.

1537
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:10,000
Your fever is worse now than ever.

1538
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,980
Here is to the feverish passion of my darling angel.

1539
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:15,740
Ding!

1540
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:18,640
31st, bam!

1541
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:19,960
Welcome to my membership, thank you.

1542
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,020
Mama.

1543
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:22,440
Yes, darling.

1544
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:27,340
Let's call Papa and wish him a happy birthday, even though
it's already past midnight.

1545
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:29,120
Hmm.

1546
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:32,580
Not tonight, Amelie.

1547
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:34,720
Okay.

1548
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:36,620
I hate you!

1549
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:39,020
Mint coughing, baby.

1550
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:40,520
Shut up!

1551
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:41,520
Shut up!

1552
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:42,540
Shut up, nanoplasm!

1553
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:43,060
Shut up!

1554
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:43,680
Shut up!

1555
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:49,300
I had the lady's voice stuck in my head all day after the
last time you did it.

1556
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:49,740
OMG.

1557
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,500
It looks like this little girl was safe all along.

1558
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:58,980
I already knew that, but I'm still relieved.

1559
01:37:59,180 --> 01:37:59,720
All the same.

1560
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:02,560
What did I do?

1561
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,900
Don't turn my coughs into baby coughs.

1562
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:13,060
Don't turn my coughs into baby cough, baby cough, listening
files.

1563
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:16,400
You!

1564
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:21,960
There's another lucky development, too.

1565
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:25,460
Emily wants to call her father.

1566
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:29,140
I can make use of that feeling somehow.

1567
01:38:30,580 --> 01:38:32,980
That would surely bring the Justice Minister around.

1568
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:34,520
Wait, so that's a lighter right there?

1569
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:41,220
Do we have to just light the shelf on fire and have it move
the phone closer to her?

1570
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:42,960
Trick time.

1571
01:38:47,110 --> 01:38:48,010
Light it.

1572
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,160
Oh, easy.

1573
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:56,680
More arson.

1574
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:58,000
The phone.

1575
01:38:59,580 --> 01:38:59,980
Oh, oh.

1576
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:01,980
Don't look it.

1577
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:02,740
Oh, don't look it.

1578
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:02,960
Look.

1579
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:04,860
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1580
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:08,720
Hurry up.

1581
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:09,080
Call.

1582
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:14,540
Amelie, I told you you couldn't call him tonight.

1583
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:16,420
Why not?

1584
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:18,580
Listen to me, Amelie.

1585
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,700
Your father is about to make a big mistake.

1586
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,060
I want him to reconsider.

1587
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:25,100
Ooh.

1588
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:27,960
What do you know about it, Mama?

1589
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:30,840
He's the one who's the justice minister, you know.

1590
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:34,100
All you do is write weird novels.

1591
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:56,360
what what do you mean weird how dare you disparage my
romantic expressions now you've really made me angry you

1592
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,520
really have oh my god

1593
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:12,310
what's wrong with her what happened to her hair How dare you
expect me to forgive such an insult?

1594
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:18,890
It's called Hentai and it's an art.

1595
01:40:20,570 --> 01:40:22,070
I knew it wouldn't be so easy.

1596
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:24,730
No!

1597
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:31,050
She's working on milk farm too.

1598
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:32,610
Let her cook then!

1599
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:34,290
There.

1600
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:36,590
I'll be keeping my eye on you now.

1601
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:39,030
So you won't do anything else mischievous.

1602
01:40:40,030 --> 01:40:41,610
Like calling your father.

1603
01:40:43,150 --> 01:40:44,130
I hate you!

1604
01:40:44,590 --> 01:40:46,590
I can hear you, you know.

1605
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:51,430
Ah, hum, hum.

1606
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:52,630
What a pair.

1607
01:40:53,370 --> 01:41:00,030
I don't know what this family's issues are, but I do know I
have to do something about this lady so Emily can call.

1608
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:02,730
Fire!

1609
01:41:03,830 --> 01:41:04,390
Fire!

1610
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:05,890
Set it on fire!

1611
01:41:07,970 --> 01:41:09,790
Okay, we have the waste basket.

1612
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:13,690
Oh, let's see.

1613
01:41:15,150 --> 01:41:18,170
Oh, are we going to start an electrical fire?

1614
01:41:22,230 --> 01:41:24,330
Let's start an electrical fire.

1615
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:29,370
Let's see.

1616
01:41:29,810 --> 01:41:31,030
What happens if I do this?

1617
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:37,740
Two, two what?

1618
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:41,380
Swing hard.

1619
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:42,260
Two weak.

1620
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:46,120
Look at him go.

1621
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,340
Well, I don't know what it's supposed to do, though.

1622
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,600
Poor little guy.

1623
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:56,940
What does she say here?

1624
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:58,940
She coughs.

1625
01:42:02,540 --> 01:42:04,840
Mama, what is Papa about to do?

1626
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:07,780
Never mind.

1627
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:09,960
Nothing you need to know right now, Amalie.

1628
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,020
Why is everything always such a big secret?

1629
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:14,960
I'm part of this family, too, you know.

1630
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,840
It's not something for children's ears.

1631
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:19,360
You'll understand someday.

1632
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:22,120
I don't want to know someday.

1633
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:23,300
I want to know now.

1634
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:25,320
It's not fair.

1635
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:27,600
You just don't want to tell me.

1636
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:30,900
I just want to wish Papa a happy birthday.

1637
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:32,760
Not tonight.

1638
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:36,220
If it was up to me, I'd let her call him.

1639
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:37,540
Thanks, Sissel.

1640
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:40,160
How nice.

1641
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:42,420
Hmm.

1642
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,500
If he swings harder...

1643
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:48,800
I don't know, let's see.

1644
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:51,020
Let's go back up here.

1645
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:53,040
We turn this.

1646
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:54,520
Hoist.

1647
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:57,440
Turn that.

1648
01:42:58,420 --> 01:42:59,720
Examine the dictionary.

1649
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:02,300
The lady's dictionary.

1650
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:04,680
Wasn't this on her desk before?

1651
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:06,040
The poor thing.

1652
01:43:06,340 --> 01:43:08,480
Destined to never be returned to the bookshelves.

1653
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:15,780
Hoist.

1654
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:18,240
Hmm.

1655
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:19,820
Hmm.

1656
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,340
We turn this valve.

1657
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:26,620
Oh, make it chime.

1658
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:29,760
Ping-bong!

1659
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:31,580
Oh!

1660
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:35,680
Well, well, having a good time.

1661
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:37,260
Are we, little rodent?

1662
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:37,960
Woo!

1663
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,060
Yes, mommy.

1664
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:44,140
Sweet dreams!

1665
01:43:44,860 --> 01:43:45,100
Ow!

1666
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:47,700
This poor guy...

1667
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:47,940
Wait.

1668
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:52,620
Fancy the vintage, my whiskered friend.

1669
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:53,920
Ding!

1670
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:56,680
Oh!

1671
01:43:57,740 --> 01:44:01,680
But it moved over the lamp.

1672
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:02,740
Or not the lamp.

1673
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:04,080
The um...

1674
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:04,680
The chandelier.

1675
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:05,820
The sconce?

1676
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:06,860
The sconce.

1677
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,860
She's more powerful than I thought.

1678
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:13,340
It looks like she tipped the wall.

1679
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,040
Oh, candelabra.

1680
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,580
The candelabra to one side too.

1681
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:20,520
Hmm, the angle of those candles.

1682
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:25,040
I get the feeling I've seen something very similar to that
quite recently.

1683
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:27,420
Yes, we have.

1684
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:37,350
I better not put out the lamp right now.

1685
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:40,490
It will only pour oil on the flames of anger in this lady's
heart.

1686
01:44:41,470 --> 01:44:45,950
If I want to give Amelia a chance to use the telephone, I
have to think of a way to keep her mother out of the way.

1687
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:55,630
So we turn the rat to the other side and we get her to turn
around.

1688
01:44:57,030 --> 01:45:10,950
turn turn turn there we go oh oh my god this poor rat no
this poor rat oh oh heaven's a blackout at a critical time

1689
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:21,470
like this of course dim lights suit my story of love very
well but i myself am not very fond of the dark is the rat

1690
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:32,340
okay This chandelier just narrowly missed the back of my
head.

1691
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:36,340
I love the thrill of romance, but I don't need these kinds
of thrills.

1692
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,100
Thank you.

1693
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:42,580
I forgot that she lights it with her ass.

1694
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:03,530
Oh, she's going to drink that.

1695
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:06,910
Ah, what a wonderful atmosphere.

1696
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:12,570
Perfect for a clandestine meeting in the dusky twilight.

1697
01:46:14,470 --> 01:46:15,590
Trick time.

1698
01:46:19,590 --> 01:46:22,370
I don't exactly know how this situation came about.

1699
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:24,970
But I think I owe that rat an apology.

1700
01:46:26,070 --> 01:46:27,330
The rat seems to be unconscious.

1701
01:46:28,030 --> 01:46:31,670
But now that the room has changed into this, maybe I can use
it somehow.

1702
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:33,230
Yes.

1703
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:36,570
So the rat...

1704
01:46:39,430 --> 01:46:41,870
If I crank this...

1705
01:46:41,870 --> 01:46:42,110
Oh!

1706
01:46:42,190 --> 01:46:42,750
My goodness.

1707
01:46:42,910 --> 01:46:47,930
What a naughty chandelier.

1708
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:50,710
Sorry, ma'am.

1709
01:46:52,010 --> 01:46:53,390
Sorry, I'm so naughty.

1710
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:53,950
I'm naughty.

1711
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:55,470
I'm a naughty chandelier.

1712
01:46:57,870 --> 01:47:00,330
If the rat died, you'd have to go back in time to save it.

1713
01:47:00,530 --> 01:47:00,910
You're right.

1714
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:09,220
Do I open this?

1715
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:12,760
It doesn't do anything.

1716
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,620
I can't tell if I'm being timed here or not.

1717
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:26,800
You know?

1718
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:31,080
Swing harder?

1719
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:34,140
No.

1720
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:43,680
Burn brighter!

1721
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:46,780
Whoa!

1722
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:49,460
Wow.

1723
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:58,860
We need to get something to swing on the clock, maybe.

1724
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:08,600
Or...

1725
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:13,180
If I lower it...

1726
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:13,700
The

1727
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,940
music is relaxing.

1728
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,580
It is kind of making me sleepy.

1729
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:21,360
I'm not gonna lie.

1730
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:22,660
Why turn this again?

1731
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:26,060
It doesn't do anything.

1732
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,700
The lights are out, so it doesn't really matter anyway.

1733
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:31,700
Um...

1734
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:37,020
Nothing there.

1735
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:42,500
Something related to the dictionary?

1736
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:43,440
Let's try it.

1737
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:46,960
The lady's dictionary.

1738
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:48,360
Wasn't this on the disc before?

1739
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:49,200
Yep, nope.

1740
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:52,500
And I can't reach anything over on the other side.

1741
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:54,600
I don't think they have anything to do with it this time.

1742
01:49:05,470 --> 01:49:06,790
Can I get her hair?

1743
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:08,730
When she leans back!

1744
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:09,950
Oh, dang.

1745
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:14,880
That was close.

1746
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:22,050
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1747
01:49:25,090 --> 01:49:26,030
Drop it!

1748
01:49:26,710 --> 01:49:26,970
Drop it!

1749
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:28,130
Whoa!

1750
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:33,810
Such insolence!

1751
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:38,750
Okay, a little bit more.

1752
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:44,140
That was close too.

1753
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,880
I want to see what Cicel says about it.

1754
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:56,060
Twice she managed to dodge like that.

1755
01:49:56,540 --> 01:49:58,260
Who knew she was such a dodging champion?

1756
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:00,120
I'm starting to get annoyed.

1757
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:01,380
Let me try that again.

1758
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:02,480
I'll get her this time.

1759
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:09,440
She's too good.

1760
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:10,960
She is.

1761
01:50:17,030 --> 01:50:18,310
Walk, walk, walk.

1762
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:27,760
Help me!

1763
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:29,000
Oh,

1764
01:50:36,180 --> 01:50:36,540
oh, oh.

1765
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:38,580
I'm sorry, Mama.

1766
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:39,600
I'm too dizzy.

1767
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:40,840
I can't get up.

1768
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:43,700
I'm afraid I can't help you right now.

1769
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:49,320
Here?

1770
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:51,540
It's to the weakness of my darling angel.

1771
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:52,780
Ding!

1772
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:59,620
That chandelier is on there tighter than her wedding band.

1773
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,940
She won't be able to escape on her own.

1774
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:04,380
Crank?

1775
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:08,840
Oh my god, this is kind of messed up.

1776
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:10,880
What is going on here?

1777
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:12,260
Emily, look.

1778
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:13,400
Do you see this?

1779
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:14,700
Help me, please.

1780
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:17,640
Sorry.

1781
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:18,640
I'm too sick.

1782
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:19,900
I can't get out of bed.

1783
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:21,160
What is going on?

1784
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:22,420
My head is...

1785
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:22,520
What?

1786
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:23,000
Oh, no.

1787
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:23,880
She doesn't have his other accent.

1788
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:24,940
My head is spinning.

1789
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:28,160
So I guess I'll just have to stay up there spinning too.

1790
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:31,260
Um...

1791
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:32,340
Um...

1792
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:32,720
Oh.

1793
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:36,480
Looks like this lady won't be going anywhere for a while.

1794
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:38,660
Now the little girl can call her father.

1795
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:41,580
Yeah, but we still have to get her to reach the phone.

1796
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:43,400
The only trouble is she can't reach it.

1797
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,560
Guess I'll just have to deliver it to her.

1798
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:47,840
Wait.

1799
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:49,520
That's right.

1800
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:50,700
The angle of those candles.

1801
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:53,420
I saw something very similar just recently, didn't I?

1802
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,260
Yeah, yeah.

1803
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:57,480
So if I burn brighter...

1804
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:00,820
Excuse me, ma'am.

1805
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:03,400
Oh my god!

1806
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:06,560
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1807
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:11,400
And then...

1808
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:11,840
Wait.

1809
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:14,240
Swing harder.

1810
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:16,220
Swing harder!

1811
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:17,640
Swing harder!

1812
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:18,540
Oh!

1813
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:19,900
It got the ride.

1814
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:22,080
Oh, there we go.

1815
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:23,740
I had a feeling that I might be the rat.

1816
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:28,340
Now I really owe that poor rat an apology.

1817
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:30,660
This might be a really good chance for me, too.

1818
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:32,080
I have to get that phone to Ameli.

1819
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:34,620
Okay, swing harder, swing harder.

1820
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:37,740
Oh my god.

1821
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:38,660
This is chaos.

1822
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:40,280
This is absolute chaos.

1823
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:43,100
Arson, arson, arson, arson.

1824
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:47,560
There we go.

1825
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:49,300
Mama!

1826
01:52:52,110 --> 01:52:53,110
What in the world?

1827
01:52:53,130 --> 01:52:54,270

1828
01:53:02,550 --> 01:53:12,710

Hello, Papa.

1833
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:01,490
Oh, Millie.

1834
01:54:01,890 --> 01:54:03,450
You know what's kind of messed up about this situation?

1835
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:06,130
Is...

1836
01:54:07,050 --> 01:54:09,730
You know, it's kind of like what he said.

1837
01:54:11,770 --> 01:54:14,130
Even if it's not his daughter that's been kidnapped.

1838
01:54:15,030 --> 01:54:17,370
There's still a daughter, or still someone that...

1839
01:54:17,370 --> 01:54:19,370
It's still a young girl that has been kidnapped.

1840
01:54:20,810 --> 01:54:21,250
That...

1841
01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:29,710
the the the ransom is the death of the guy but he's just
like well it's not my daughter so I guess it doesn't matter

I don't know how this keeps happening

1847
01:55:48,900 --> 01:56:02,100
She's reading the script No Oh my god Yo I thought this was

You're awesome.

Oh, you need to stop doing this.

1852
01:56:17,740 --> 01:56:18,520
It's not funny anymore.

1853
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:19,040
I'm scared.

1854
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:20,260
I'm scared too.

1855
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:23,120
Maybe this is the ghost trick all along.

1856
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:25,780
Okay, so we'll come back.

1857
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:26,600
Thank you and hybrid.

1858
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:27,460
Welcome back.

1859
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:28,100
Stop reading.

1860
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:28,760
I'm not reading.

1861
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:31,240
I'm a real Ace Attorney fan.

1862
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:32,740
It's true.

1863
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:37,900
Oh, man.

1864
01:56:38,860 --> 01:56:40,320
Ghost to ghost communication.

1865
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:42,220
Okay.

1866
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:47,200
Oh, my stubborn mother is kind of tied up at the moment.

1867
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:50,520
Get me down.

1868
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:54,120
She needs to be taught a lesson for causing us so much
trouble.

1869
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,160
Angelic descent, welcome to Mambusha.

1870
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:00,540
Mint, are you the lamp?

1871
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:05,420
No, Amelie.

1872
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:07,000
Is it you?

1873
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:07,800
Are you the baddie?

1874
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:10,400
I'm the one who is wrong.

1875
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:12,640
Hey, what's in the sand?

1876
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:13,720
Is that the script?

1877
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:20,680
You could have lived if you played this game within four
minutes of your own death, and you're right!

1878
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:22,480
Huh?

1879
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:25,040
Could you tell your mother I'm sorry?

1880
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:28,300
What do you have to be sorry about?

1881
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:30,400
Can I have the lottery numbers?

1882
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:35,440
If you're a shoe Takumi, can we have another Edgeworth game?

1883
01:57:38,240 --> 01:57:40,960
I was just about to make a terrible mistake.

1884
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:43,260
right now.

1885
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:43,600
Oh!

1886
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:45,860
Oh my god, his face all of a sudden.

1887
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:47,640
Oh, he's actually kind of handsome.

1888
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:50,480
Oh, okay.

1889
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:52,640
You're still young.

1890
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:54,920
There's a lot I can't tell you right now.

1891
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,640
The job of Justice Minister is very complicated, you see.

1892
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:01,480
Yeah, he lost all of his wrinkles instantly.

1893
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:03,540
Okay.

1894
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:08,640
But just remember, you're always the most important thing to
your mother and me.

1895
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:13,960
Did you do something naughty to your mother.

1896
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:15,920
If you did, I want you to apologize.

1897
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,460
I don't think I did anything.

1898
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:20,520
But okay, I'll apologize.

1899
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:22,500
That's a good girl.

1900
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:24,120
Okay, Papa.

1901
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:24,980
Have a good night.

1902
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:25,920
I love you.

1903
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:28,040
I love you too, Amelie.

1904
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:29,380
Have a good night, sweetheart.

1905
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:31,860
Then that was that.

1906
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:36,740
Maybe you should call the police.

1907
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:39,400
Uh, Mama?

1908
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:41,780
I'm sorry.

1909
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:44,980
My goodness, why are the change.

1910
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:47,900
I guess I was wrong about you.

1911
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:49,200
I didn't understand.

1912
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:51,340
Oh, Amelie.

1913
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:53,820
Yeah, and the fire department.

1914
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:57,680
I thought all you ever did was write these weird novels.

1915
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,200
That makes me a little sad.

1916
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:03,760
Papa said the job of Justice Minister was complicated.

1917
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:08,380
Yes, your father's job is very, very complicated and
difficult.

1918
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:11,440
That's why I couldn't talk to you about most of it.

1919
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:23,040
you're right i couldn't i shouldn't treat you like such a
little girl anymore you're growing up after all and i

1920
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:32,100
promise to stop calling your novels weird and try actually
read oh no no no no no don't read them what oh uh maybe you

1921
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:41,140
better wait until you're a little older for that oh okay so
amily if you're feeling a little more charitable towards

1922
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:46,420
your old mama do you think you could let me down You know, I
would love to do that.

1923
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:49,860
But I'm just feeling too dizzy and sick right now.

1924
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:52,660
Oh.

1925
01:59:57,080 --> 02:00:01,040
Tonight, on this holiest of nights, my deadline.

1926
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:05,200
It looks like the only thing pressing on me will be this
chandelier.

1927
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,660
Here's the Papa and Mama's darling angel.

1928
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:09,520
Ding.

1929
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:15,540
That thing is so...

1930
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:16,460
It's so...

1931
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:17,220
What's the word?

1932
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:25,460
so sturdy it's holding her up so well all of a sudden
everybody is getting along again it's such an abrupt change

1933
02:00:25,460 --> 02:00:34,480
I can't understand it is this what family is all about in
any case the situation has changed dramatically now I just

1934
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:41,980
hope the mysteries of me can be cleared up as quickly as the
furrows of on the ministers bro I wish I was that chandelier

1935
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:49,160
pun pun you keep you keep you keep dreaming you know never
let go of that dream.

1936
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:55,640
Think about how you want to be the chandelier in this very
moment and never let go of that feeling.

1937
02:00:56,800 --> 02:01:08,880
Thank God if only if only I were the chandelier tightly
tightly grasping a grown woman's waist her bosom too big to

1938
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:21,700
fit through her butt her bottom too big as well just keep
about that as your dream just keep thinking about it and

1939
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:27,300
never let go because that is what dreams are made of

1940
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:38,100
I don't know where Camilla is at least now the justice
minister's doubts are dispelled I think I'll go back to his

1941
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:44,160
office where everybody is waiting for the prison van oh
don't tell me we got there and he already got picked up

1942
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:53,260
never let go of the bosom or the bottom Be the chandelier.

1943
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:55,480
I'll toast to that.

1944
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:02,660
Top and bottom's big because they're filled with our dreams.

1945
02:02:03,320 --> 02:02:04,600
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

1946
02:02:06,180 --> 02:02:07,480
Mint, I'm stuck in my dreams.

1947
02:02:09,420 --> 02:02:09,880
Dream.

1948
02:02:10,140 --> 02:02:10,840
Keep dreaming.

1949
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:12,560
Don't let go of the dreams.

1950
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:14,020
Just keep living.

1951
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:16,100
Live and dream.

1952
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:19,700
The minister's family now has their smiles and harmony back.

1953
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:21,300
But Camilla is still in the hands of the Lord.

1954
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:22,100
of the kidnappers.

1955
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:24,940
I decided to go back to the Justice Minister's office.

1956
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:26,920
Oisha.

1957
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:30,700
the Minister's brow is still just as furrowed as ever.

1958
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:36,840
Quite unlike a father who had just learned his daughter is
safe, he seems to still be in the depths of despair.

1959
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:41,400
That atmosphere in this room is very different now.

1960
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:44,020
It seems to have an air of unfocused anxiety.

1961
02:02:44,580 --> 02:02:46,960
I get the feeling something big is about to happen.

1962
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:56,940
I just found out that my daughter is safe.

1963
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:00,240
I'd like to express my gratitude.

1964
02:03:01,580 --> 02:03:01,960
Thank you.

1965
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:03,560
Thank you for my daughter's sake.

1966
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:04,400
And for mine.

1967
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:07,240
Oh, ha, who?

1968
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:10,420
No need to thank us, Mr. Minister.

1969
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:11,460
It was nothing.

1970
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:13,240
You didn't do anything.

1971
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:15,580
What did he do?

1972
02:03:17,580 --> 02:03:18,660
Well, one question.

1973
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:21,000
I can't help but notice.

1974
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:22,580
Your daughter is safe.

1975
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:26,280
And yet you still look unhappy.

1976
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:39,660
a little smile for us ah of course there is still the matter
of the other kidnapping victim but is that really the only

1977
02:03:39,660 --> 02:03:41,460
thing that troubles you mr minister

1978
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:58,800
oh please let me think in peace until the prison van arrives
what no no no come on man I wonder if Lynn is back at the

1979
02:03:58,800 --> 02:03:59,340
park yet.

1980
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:01,900
Until we get her report, I guess we'll just have to wait
here.

1981
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:04,060
This continued distress of the ministers.

1982
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:08,460
Is there really something more to it, like the inspector in
white said?

1983
02:04:08,780 --> 02:04:10,060
Yeah, let's see what he says now.

1984
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:13,040
Oh, because also, he's...

1985
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:16,600
Is he, like, probably, like, getting blackmailed by the blue
people or something, you know?

1986
02:04:25,070 --> 02:04:25,790
Hold on.

1987
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:33,480
Hello, Justice Minister.

1988
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:38,000
How about you finally admit I do exist?

1989
02:04:39,740 --> 02:04:40,820
That thank you I expressed.

1990
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:42,540
That was meant for you.

1991
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:46,480
You're a ghost, aren't you?

1992
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:49,700
And you have the power to control and manipulate people,
don't you?

1993
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:52,180
No, I don't have that kind of power.

1994
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:53,820
I can't control you.

1995
02:04:56,120 --> 02:04:56,600
Ghost?

1996
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:01,560
We've actually known you, you know, for quite a while now.

1997
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:06,300
They were the powers of the dead, of ghosts.

1998
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:07,360
Known.

1999
02:05:07,720 --> 02:05:08,620
Wait, known about what?

2000
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:15,040
We knew about the existence of somebody who could control
others.

2001
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:16,980
A manipulator.

2002
02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:19,280
What's this?

2003
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:23,460
That's why your execution order caused me so much anguish,
Detective Jowd.

2004
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:25,320
Mr. Minister.

2005
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:28,340
Why don't you just tell us everything you know?

2006
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:30,040
Is that why they're in the special prison?

2007
02:05:31,700 --> 02:05:33,460
Is everybody in the special prison?

2008
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:36,180
affected by these manipulating cases?

2009
02:05:38,900 --> 02:05:41,480
So they might be innocent, but like...

2010
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:45,100
They were manipulated?

2011
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:46,580
Hmm.

2012
02:05:52,670 --> 02:05:54,010
I suppose I should.

2013
02:05:56,150 --> 02:05:56,710
QMalia!

2014
02:05:56,950 --> 02:05:57,630
Thanks for the five gifted.

2015
02:05:57,990 --> 02:05:58,290
Thank you!

2016
02:05:59,150 --> 02:06:00,650
You need to hear it all.

2017
02:06:01,210 --> 02:06:03,610
All about the huge mistake this foolish man made.

2018
02:06:05,450 --> 02:06:05,830
Manipulator.

2019
02:06:07,130 --> 02:06:11,670
There are some cases in this country right now that are
under a top-secret investigation!

2020
02:06:13,150 --> 02:06:15,190
Of course you wouldn't have known about them, Detective
Jaur.

2021
02:06:15,950 --> 02:06:19,330
Right, they don't share too much top-secret information with
the inmates in prison.

2022
02:06:21,110 --> 02:06:24,370
There are three prisoners, including you and the special
prison you've just escaped from.

2023
02:06:25,210 --> 02:06:27,130
All three cases have certain points in common.

2024
02:06:28,090 --> 02:06:28,910
They do, do they?

2025
02:06:29,250 --> 02:06:30,070
Tell us more.

2026
02:06:32,450 --> 02:06:33,530
I knew it!

2027
02:06:33,670 --> 02:06:37,190
The rock singer who leaked national secrets in his lyrics
during a TV broadcast.

2028
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:47,380
The curry-loving fellow who took the chief commissioner
hostage at the Metro Police Department.

2029
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:52,640
Neither of these men had a motive for their crime, and both
of their crimes were impossible.

2030
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:56,000
Impossible.

2031
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:57,760
Impossible.

2032
02:06:58,460 --> 02:07:01,740
The curry lover had no way of knowing how to infiltrate the
commissioner's office.

2033
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:05,100
And the rock singer had no way of knowing the national
secrets he leaked.

2034
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:06,920
Sausage head.

2035
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:10,780
The special investigation unit?

2036
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:13,600
submitted an investigative report to me on them.

2037
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:17,620
It concluded that these men's criminal acts were not of
their own volition.

2038
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:21,080
But how could that be?

2039
02:07:23,260 --> 02:07:28,000
The theory the unit came up with was the existence of a
manipulator.

2040
02:07:30,180 --> 02:07:31,380
A manipulator, huh?

2041
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:34,860
Ghost that saves lives and ghost that kills wives.

2042
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:41,480
That's when the special prison was established as a facility
to research that theory.

2043
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:44,520
It would make sense then why she has the sixth sense, right?

2044
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:51,300
Because if they're working with the bad ghost, if they're
working with a bad ghost, she would have the ability to

2045
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:53,360
sense ghosts, you know?

2046
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:11,860
Sorry, I was chewing.

2047
02:08:13,780 --> 02:08:14,120
Um.

2048
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:20,780
That's when the special prison was established as a facility
to research that theory.

2049
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:23,600
Jowd's case.

2050
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:26,260
work.

2051
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:30,060
These past several years, Inspector Cabanela has been
studying these cases.

2052
02:08:31,180 --> 02:08:32,140
He has, has he?

2053
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:36,380
Manipulating somebody into committing a criminal act.

2054
02:08:37,060 --> 02:08:39,820
According to the inspector, hmm?

2055
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:43,180
Wow, Joshua!

2056
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:45,840
Firmly grasped the ghost.

2057
02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:47,800
Thank you for the outcome so far!

2058
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:48,780
Thank you!

2059
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:49,840
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2060
02:08:52,340 --> 02:08:53,420
Thank you so much.

2061
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:54,400
I really appreciate it.

2062
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:59,300
of its kind was a locked room murder involving our nation's
best detective.

2063
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:03,720
Are you saying I was somehow manipulated?

2064
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:07,260
Or are you trying to say I was manipulated somehow into
shooting Alma?

2065
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:13,140
I appreciate the theory, but unfortunately, I don't recall
being controlled by anybody.

2066
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:17,440
It's just not possible to manipulate another's behavior like
that.

2067
02:09:18,860 --> 02:09:21,440
My powers certainly don't work on living creatures.

2068
02:09:23,220 --> 02:09:25,720
That's what I thought when I first heard the theory, too.

2069
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:30,440
However, I was seriously mistaken, and it proved to be a big
mistake.

2070
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:32,560
What?

2071
02:09:33,860 --> 02:09:36,580
Okay, the minister's mistake.

2072
02:09:39,020 --> 02:09:40,520
You mentioned a mistake.

2073
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:42,000
Could you tell us about it?

2074
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:45,880
I suppose everybody here has the right to know.

2075
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:47,220
All right, fine.

2076
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:47,960
I'll speak out.

2077
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:53,780
Can you just Inspector Cavanella is like sitting in this
room in silence while they're probably all like...

2078
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:59,480
locked in in this conversation in their brain.

2079
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:04,300
All right, fine.

2080
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:07,300
I'll speak out loud so that Inspector Cabanela can hear this
too.

2081
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:09,680
Oh, interesting, okay.

2082
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:11,660
Everyone's using codecs.

2083
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:13,940
It's the go, it's the godeck.

2084
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:16,800
It's the ghost codeck.

2085
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:21,560
There's something I'd like the two of you to hear.

2086
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:25,140
It's about a mistake I made.

2087
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:33,940
Inspector Cabanilla, when you first made that report about a
manipulator, I'm afraid I didn't believe it at all.

2088
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:36,040
Impossible, I thought.

2089
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:40,460
Perfectly understandable, Mr. Minister.

2090
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:42,400
But I was wrong.

2091
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,440
That kind of power does exist.

2092
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:46,360
And I...

2093
02:10:47,260 --> 02:10:49,980
I learned the truth of that firsthand.

2094
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:54,120
What's this?

2095
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:59,380
A month ago, I signed the order to carry out Detective
Jowd's execution.

2096
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:03,980
However, that act wasn't of my own volition.

2097
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:07,840
I was being controlled.

2098
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:09,560
What?

2099
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:13,480
You never told me about this, Mr. Minister?

2100
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:25,680
What's going on?

2101
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:26,700
This document?

2102
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:28,180
What am I doing?

2103
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:31,840
No, I mustn't sign it.

2104
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:34,280
Oh, oh.

2105
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:35,280
Oh!

2106
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:36,100
Oh!

2107
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:36,740
Oh!

2108
02:11:39,730 --> 02:11:40,750
Why is he clapping?

2109
02:11:44,310 --> 02:11:45,190
What's going on?

2110
02:11:45,270 --> 02:11:46,110
Wait, did he sign it?

2111
02:11:46,290 --> 02:11:46,970
Oh no!

2112
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:49,850
Wait, don't deliver that document!

2113
02:11:52,850 --> 02:11:54,530
Oh, I guess she just doesn't listen to you.

2114
02:11:57,530 --> 02:11:58,830
That's when it started.

2115
02:11:59,530 --> 02:12:02,210
That's when all of my fear, despair, and suffering began.

2116
02:12:02,350 --> 02:12:03,750
Oh my god, he must be so paranoid.

2117
02:12:06,990 --> 02:12:07,430
Oh.

2118
02:12:08,210 --> 02:12:11,230
Fear, fear, despair, and suffering.

2119
02:12:15,770 --> 02:12:20,210
At the time, it didn't even cross my mind that I had been
manipulated.

2120
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:24,130
And my memory of the event was only hazy at best.

2121
02:12:25,090 --> 02:12:28,110
So the memory of being manipulated doesn't clearly remain,
eh?

2122
02:12:29,190 --> 02:12:32,470
Signing execution orders is part of a justice minister's
job.

2123
02:12:33,350 --> 02:12:36,970
At the time, I just thought my psyche was rebelling against
the task.

2124
02:12:38,370 --> 02:12:46,630
through this arm I live but the next day it dawned on me I
remembered Inspector Cabanilla's report on the existence of

2125
02:12:46,630 --> 02:12:57,670
a manipulator oh as the Minister of Justice I couldn't admit
what had happened to me I only signed the execution order

2126
02:12:57,670 --> 02:13:06,290
because I was being controlled oh sorry there's something
like that got out this nation's judicial system would

2127
02:13:06,290 --> 02:13:10,970
crumble besides I had no evidence to present that I had
actually been controlled.

2128
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:15,730
One month haunting.

2129
02:13:15,890 --> 02:13:16,750
Thank you.

2130
02:13:18,110 --> 02:13:20,590
So in the end, I couldn't admit to anybody what had
happened.

2131
02:13:22,070 --> 02:13:23,070
Hmm, I suppose.

2132
02:13:23,830 --> 02:13:25,590
But it sounds like a bit of an excuse.

2133
02:13:26,710 --> 02:13:28,790
You should have at least told us, Mr. Minister.

2134
02:13:30,450 --> 02:13:31,530
Noat, thank you.

2135
02:13:31,690 --> 02:13:35,190
Sounds awfully familiar to the tale of someone eating cake
with no memory of it, huh?

2136
02:13:39,550 --> 02:13:39,990
Uh...

2137
02:13:41,930 --> 02:13:42,370
Um...

2138
02:13:42,870 --> 02:13:43,310
Anyway.

2139
02:13:45,070 --> 02:13:45,950
Next question.

2140
02:13:48,610 --> 02:13:49,430
Psycho Mantis.

2141
02:13:49,730 --> 02:13:50,610
Oh my gosh, Joshua.

2142
02:13:50,830 --> 02:13:51,750
Thank you for the ping.

2143
02:13:52,530 --> 02:13:53,050
Thank you.

2144
02:13:53,190 --> 02:13:53,530
Cool guy.

2145
02:13:53,630 --> 02:13:53,950
Welcome back.

2146
02:13:54,050 --> 02:13:54,490
Thank you.

2147
02:13:55,610 --> 02:13:56,050
Yes.

2148
02:13:56,270 --> 02:13:57,050
Yes, I know.

2149
02:13:57,190 --> 02:13:57,750
I should have.

2150
02:13:58,230 --> 02:14:00,430
I was running away from the problem.

2151
02:14:02,630 --> 02:14:03,510
Psycho Mantis.

2152
02:14:04,650 --> 02:14:05,350
His wife.

2153
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:11,510
And then my wife found out I was worried about something
well if you go around with an expression like that I guess

2154
02:14:11,510 --> 02:14:22,090
it's bound to happen I explained it to her she was dead set
against the way I was handling it oh she has whoa if you

2155
02:14:22,090 --> 02:14:30,770
don't withdraw that order and tell everybody the truth
immediately I'm moving out oh she's a she's a feisty woman

2156
02:14:30,770 --> 02:14:38,050
and then with the kidnapping tonight with it thrust under my
nose like that I could make no longer deny my mistake

2157
02:14:42,230 --> 02:14:42,870
What's this?

2158
02:14:43,070 --> 02:14:44,710
Some mysterious force has my wallet.

2159
02:14:47,170 --> 02:14:48,290
Evan, welcome back.

2160
02:14:48,410 --> 02:14:49,430
Send out mistakes with Supertet.

2161
02:14:50,050 --> 02:14:52,650
This manipulator comes upon us from somewhere unseen.

2162
02:14:53,770 --> 02:14:55,870
That's why I've been keeping my distance from everybody.

2163
02:14:57,530 --> 02:14:59,470
So that's why you've been telling people to stay back.

2164
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:06,320
So there's somebody else besides me with the powers of the
dead.

2165
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:07,540
I'm fine with that.

2166
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:10,400
After all, I already knew about a certain desk lamp.

2167
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:11,340
Yeah.

2168
02:15:11,860 --> 02:15:12,340
Yeah.

2169
02:15:12,360 --> 02:15:16,580
What I'm not fine with is the fact that person can control
and manipulate living creatures.

2170
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:18,740
That's certainly not something I can do.

2171
02:15:22,120 --> 02:15:24,680
Apparently, different ghosts get different ghost tricks.

2172
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:28,840
See, I just don't have the correct ghost trick, you guys.

2173
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:33,720
I just don't have the correct ghost trick.

2174
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:35,940
It's...

2175
02:15:35,940 --> 02:15:36,780
It could have been me.

2176
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:40,180
But I never imagined that tonight.

2177
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:50,900
I would find out where this kind of power comes from where
it comes from ghosts inspector cabanella this manipulator is

2178
02:15:50,900 --> 02:16:02,080
a ghost a departed spirit a specter a spirit as a matter of
fact there's a ghost talking to us right now oh what what

2179
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:13,600
did you say ciao don't tell me you can hear this ghost too
uh i'd say the only person who can't hear him is you Spirit,

2180
02:16:14,440 --> 02:16:15,640
ghost, gods, and heaven.

2181
02:16:18,340 --> 02:16:21,540
Excuse me, Mr. Minister, I suddenly have some urgent
business to attend to.

2182
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,540
That's kind of sussy, isn't it?

2183
02:16:26,640 --> 02:16:28,640
I'm being manipulated to send the Supa.

2184
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:30,760
I can't control my actions.

2185
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:32,680
To Chonky, no!

2186
02:16:37,380 --> 02:16:40,740
I recommend you think long and hard before making your final
decisions.

2187
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:44,740
There you go, it's trotting away.

2188
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:46,860
He didn't even, he didn't even dance.

2189
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:49,600
Is that Lynn?

2190
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:51,160
Hmm.

2191
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:54,280
Well, I'm eating.

2192
02:16:54,420 --> 02:16:54,840
This is Lynn.

2193
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:55,540
I'm at the park.

2194
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:57,840
Oh, Lynn.

2195
02:17:03,440 --> 02:17:03,880
Uh-oh.

2196
02:17:04,040 --> 02:17:05,700
Lynn's about to get kidnapped, isn't she?

2197
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:10,280
Lynn's about to get kidnapped.

2198
02:17:11,180 --> 02:17:12,720
We've been waiting for to hear from you.

2199
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:14,240
Have you found the evidence?

2200
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:20,780
Well, the situation in here is, It's kind of difficult to
explain.

2201
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:23,580
Cicel, if you're there, come to the park immediately.

2202
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:24,880
Uh-oh.

2203
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:27,780
Well, somebody died.

2204
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:35,240
It looks like your help is needed, Cicel.

2205
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:37,020
This is a normal super chat.

2206
02:17:37,240 --> 02:17:38,540
I am not being manipulated.

2207
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:43,300
That's something someone being manipulated wouldn't say.

2208
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:47,080
Someone being manipulated would say I'm being manipulated.

2209
02:17:48,940 --> 02:17:50,840
You're definitely not being manipulated.

2210
02:17:53,220 --> 02:17:54,400
Yeah, I guess so, huh?

2211
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:57,560
Let's go to the park!

2212
02:18:00,420 --> 02:18:00,940
Park.

2213
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:03,740
Yippee!

2214
02:18:04,380 --> 02:18:05,440
I'm being manipulated.

2215
02:18:05,780 --> 02:18:06,840
I'm being manipulated.

2216
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:11,780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2217
02:18:12,380 --> 02:18:13,880
I think the Chonky is onto something.

2218
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:16,160
Your ghost trick is making us send mint-colored Supas.

2219
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:17,280
Help!

2220
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:21,880
Lynn calls and I oblige.

2221
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:27,500
I take off towards Temsika Park, a place where clearly
something big is taking place.

2222
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:32,840
Skye, please, thank you for that question, bro.

2223
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:34,440
I am in full control of myself.

2224
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:37,760
All my faculties are working without issue nor impediment.

2225
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:39,920
The bank will not decline the payment request.

2226
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:42,320
I will remember exactly what I've done with no regret.

2227
02:18:42,660 --> 02:18:45,300
There is no negative influence on my person at this moment.

2228
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:46,620
I'm not blinking.

2229
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:48,860
Thank you for that question, bro.

2230
02:18:48,940 --> 02:18:52,000
That totally was not manipulated out of you.

2231
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:54,260
Thank you.

2232
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:56,820
The guards don't say anything.

2233
02:18:56,980 --> 02:18:58,220
They've been there all along for everything.

2234
02:18:58,420 --> 02:18:58,960
Are they deaf?

2235
02:18:59,380 --> 02:19:00,280
You know what?

2236
02:19:00,300 --> 02:19:01,140
Don't worry about them.

2237
02:19:01,740 --> 02:19:04,520
It's like the guards at, you know, the palace and stuff.

2238
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:07,820
They're not allowed to, they're not allowed to, you know,
interact.

2239
02:19:09,160 --> 02:19:11,160
It's like a person on a nature documentary.

2240
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:14,760
You just watch from the distance.

2241
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:15,880
Fukuro, thanks for the 550.

2242
02:19:16,540 --> 02:19:17,380
Stupid shark.

2243
02:19:17,740 --> 02:19:18,580
It's happening here too.

2244
02:19:18,940 --> 02:19:19,640
Thank you.

2245
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:22,620
There must be a manipulator on every turn.

2246
02:19:23,440 --> 02:19:24,840
Every time I turn on my gacha.

2247
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:26,600
Oh, probably.

2248
02:19:26,880 --> 02:19:27,740
Oh my gosh, say that!

2249
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:30,040
Am I...

2250
02:19:30,660 --> 02:19:31,220
Many...

2251
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:31,860
Pull...

2252
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:32,320
Layden?

2253
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:33,960
No, no.

2254
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:34,960
I guess it works.

2255
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:36,480
Man, gotcha, or something.

2256
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:40,660
Man, many, many pull...

2257
02:19:40,660 --> 02:19:40,980
Layden.

2258
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:42,420
I don't know that word.

2259
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:43,560
Strange.

2260
02:19:43,860 --> 02:19:44,420
Too strange.

2261
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:45,440
I'm sorry.

2262
02:19:45,940 --> 02:19:46,220
Sorry.

2263
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:48,920
I think I've missed so many words since I've been...

2264
02:19:48,940 --> 02:19:49,220
dead?

2265
02:19:49,740 --> 02:19:51,500
You know, my memory is kind of, you know.

2266
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:53,540
Hayden, thanks for the five gifted!

2267
02:19:55,140 --> 02:19:57,200
Alright, let's go to Temsik Park, everybody.

2268
02:19:59,620 --> 02:20:00,500
The manipulator.

2269
02:20:00,780 --> 02:20:03,300
The person whose very existence sheds new light on
everything.

2270
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:05,020
Detective Jowd's crime.

2271
02:20:05,320 --> 02:20:08,040
The execution orders, and even my own death.

2272
02:20:09,980 --> 02:20:10,580
Could it be?

2273
02:20:10,900 --> 02:20:13,400
Could Lynn have been manipulated into shooting me?

2274
02:20:15,940 --> 02:20:16,420
Oh!

2275
02:20:16,420 --> 02:20:18,660
I completely forgot that was an element!

2276
02:20:18,940 --> 02:20:21,080
Oh my gosh!

2277
02:20:22,340 --> 02:20:23,160
Boy, oh my gosh.

2278
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:24,740
Thank you guys for all the super chats.

2279
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:25,500
Thank you!

2280
02:20:28,020 --> 02:20:29,120
Thank you guys.

2281
02:20:31,300 --> 02:20:33,400
That song was called To Nothingness?

2282
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:35,060
How many, what chapter are we on?

2283
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:35,980
I can't remember.

2284
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:37,180
It was 13 now?

2285
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:38,560
14!

2286
02:20:39,300 --> 02:20:41,020
14 out of...

2287
02:20:43,380 --> 02:20:43,900
Um...

2288
02:20:43,900 --> 02:20:45,160
Out of 18, right?

2289
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:48,900
I wonder if I should just power through today.

2290
02:20:48,940 --> 02:20:52,880
I wonder if I should just power it through today.

2291
02:20:57,850 --> 02:20:59,950
Was this sending a message while resisting?

2292
02:21:00,130 --> 02:21:01,110
I'm being manipulated.

2293
02:21:01,810 --> 02:21:02,810
No, no, no.

2294
02:21:02,970 --> 02:21:04,510
You wanted to send that.

2295
02:21:06,410 --> 02:21:07,430
Nice progress.

2296
02:21:12,550 --> 02:21:14,590
Don't you have something big tomorrow?

2297
02:21:16,510 --> 02:21:16,890
Do I?

2298
02:21:18,830 --> 02:21:19,910
I don't think so.

2299
02:21:22,270 --> 02:21:23,550
Let me check my calendar.

2300
02:21:26,750 --> 02:21:28,510
Oh, I don't know what I just did.

2301
02:21:30,110 --> 02:21:30,630
Uh, no.

2302
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:32,990
Wait, tomorrow's Wednesday.

2303
02:21:35,490 --> 02:21:36,670
The rest is long.

2304
02:21:37,250 --> 02:21:37,670
Hmm.

2305
02:21:39,070 --> 02:21:45,050
If I do four more chapters, one hour each about, there'll be
four more hours.

2306
02:21:45,410 --> 02:21:46,050
Time is it?

2307
02:21:46,270 --> 02:21:47,930
Hmm, might be into the middle of the night.

2308
02:21:50,250 --> 02:21:50,770
Hmm.

2309
02:21:50,790 --> 02:21:53,050
After this chapter is the best stopping point.

2310
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:54,970
I'm not being manipulated.

2311
02:21:55,310 --> 02:21:55,530
Ah!

2312
02:21:58,030 --> 02:22:00,190
Wait until after this chapter if you want to decide to
finish.

2313
02:22:00,330 --> 02:22:02,070
The upcoming puzzle is probably the hardest in the game.

2314
02:22:02,850 --> 02:22:03,030
Okay.

2315
02:22:03,650 --> 02:22:03,910
All right.

2316
02:22:04,010 --> 02:22:04,490
Cool, cool, cool.

2317
02:22:04,650 --> 02:22:06,810
Then we'll decide for this puzzle after.

2318
02:22:08,630 --> 02:22:08,830
Okay.

2319
02:22:10,950 --> 02:22:11,690
Ghosted notes?

2320
02:22:11,890 --> 02:22:13,210
What's the...

2321
02:22:13,210 --> 02:22:13,490
Boo!

2322
02:22:16,330 --> 02:22:16,730
Boo!

2323
02:22:17,310 --> 02:22:19,070
What kind of stationary does a ghost use?

2324
02:22:19,850 --> 02:22:20,630
Ghosted notes!

2325
02:22:21,910 --> 02:22:25,710
Okay, maybe we'll do this chapter and then we'll save it for
tomorrow.

2326
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:27,890
I could probably finish it tomorrow, then.

2327
02:22:28,530 --> 02:22:29,170
Temsik Park.

2328
02:22:29,530 --> 02:22:31,710
The site of the little lady Camilla's abduction tonight.

2329
02:22:32,390 --> 02:22:35,430
And the place where an important piece of evidence, the
music box was hidden.

2330
02:22:41,270 --> 02:22:42,970
Oh, wow, we're on the whole other side.

2331
02:22:43,310 --> 02:22:46,170
I wonder why our lady detective is looking so dejected.

2332
02:22:46,710 --> 02:22:47,750
At least she isn't dead.

2333
02:22:48,230 --> 02:22:49,230
But what did she find?

2334
02:22:51,070 --> 02:22:51,510
Hmm.

2335
02:22:53,010 --> 02:22:53,450
Okay.

2336
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:06,480
Oh, it's the chicken, it's the kitchen, chicken, chicken
kitchen man.

2337
02:23:07,300 --> 02:23:07,970
What's he doing here?

2338
02:23:12,070 --> 02:23:16,330
Let me spend a moment's time with you, la-la-la.

2339
02:23:16,830 --> 02:23:21,870
The world will not end if the food delivery is a little
late, la-la-la.

2340
02:23:22,430 --> 02:23:23,170
A little late.

2341
02:23:23,250 --> 02:23:24,650
It's already ice cold.

2342
02:23:25,250 --> 02:23:26,670
Oh my god, this guy sucks.

2343
02:23:28,370 --> 02:23:29,090
Oh,

2344
02:23:32,330 --> 02:23:34,230
you have to wait for him to get closer to us.

2345
02:23:35,050 --> 02:23:35,910
There we go.

2346
02:23:38,290 --> 02:23:38,950
Swing harder.

2347
02:23:39,250 --> 02:23:39,930
Swing harder.

2348
02:23:43,770 --> 02:23:44,490
Basketball.

2349
02:23:44,490 --> 02:23:45,070
Basketball.

2350
02:23:45,150 --> 02:23:46,250
Oh, there's a basketball in there.

2351
02:23:46,710 --> 02:23:46,850
Lobe.

2352
02:23:47,490 --> 02:23:47,910
Boot.

2353
02:23:48,730 --> 02:23:49,250
Leaflet.

2354
02:23:49,790 --> 02:23:50,330
Leaflet.

2355
02:23:51,090 --> 02:23:51,790
Love letter.

2356
02:23:55,240 --> 02:23:55,740
Ow.

2357
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:56,300
Oh.

2358
02:24:00,260 --> 02:24:02,380
Leaflet, umbrella.

2359
02:24:04,420 --> 02:24:06,160
Da-da-da-da.

2360
02:24:09,970 --> 02:24:10,450
Rugby.

2361
02:24:14,250 --> 02:24:14,730
Um...

2362
02:24:14,730 --> 02:24:15,190
Spin?

2363
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:23,120
Baseball.

2364
02:24:23,980 --> 02:24:24,960
Wait, there we go.

2365
02:24:25,480 --> 02:24:25,960
Seesaw.

2366
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:29,500
Ooh, I got this thing spinning pretty fast.

2367
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:31,420
I didn't even put much effort into it.

2368
02:24:31,900 --> 02:24:34,380
There's quite a bit of power and speed for a piece of
playground equipment.

2369
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:38,860
I can just imagine all the poor kids who get sent flying all
over the park.

2370
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:40,620
That's what I'm thinking.

2371
02:24:41,780 --> 02:24:43,160
Hello, I'm here!

2372
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:45,100
Oof!

2373
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:46,460
Wait!

2374
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:47,240
Oh, I saw it!

2375
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:48,280
I saw a dead person!

2376
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:49,800
I saw a dead person!

2377
02:24:50,360 --> 02:24:51,460
Oh, they were on the far left!

2378
02:24:52,940 --> 02:24:54,060
Oh, there you are, Sissel.

2379
02:24:55,140 --> 02:24:59,200
From your dejected expression, I gather, you didn't find
what you were looking for.

2380
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:02,100
Right, I can't find the music box anywhere.

2381
02:25:02,980 --> 02:25:04,620
But I found something else instead.

2382
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:05,980
Something horrible.

2383
02:25:07,100 --> 02:25:07,240
Horrible.

2384
02:25:07,540 --> 02:25:07,960
What is it?

2385
02:25:07,980 --> 02:25:09,080
A dead body!

2386
02:25:11,980 --> 02:25:12,460
Oh!

2387
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:14,860
There in the grass.

2388
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:16,960
You'd better see for yourself.

2389
02:25:22,190 --> 02:25:23,690
Looks like a dead body.

2390
02:25:26,370 --> 02:25:28,410
I nearly died when I saw it.

2391
02:25:28,890 --> 02:25:32,330
And I suppose now that we found it, we can't just leave it
there, can we?

2392
02:25:35,790 --> 02:25:37,070
Nope, I suppose not.

2393
02:25:38,790 --> 02:25:43,550
Oh, oh, oh, mascot.

2394
02:25:45,830 --> 02:25:47,530
All right, let's make connection.

2395
02:25:50,930 --> 02:25:51,470
Stop reading ahead.

2396
02:25:51,590 --> 02:25:52,190
What do you mean?

2397
02:25:53,210 --> 02:25:54,170
Oh, it's this guy.

2398
02:25:54,330 --> 02:25:55,150
I forgot about him.

2399
02:25:55,690 --> 02:25:58,510
Stop the park from being turned into a housing site.

2400
02:25:58,930 --> 02:25:59,890
Protect the park.

2401
02:26:00,050 --> 02:26:01,390
The rock of the gods.

2402
02:26:02,350 --> 02:26:02,970
You there.

2403
02:26:04,010 --> 02:26:05,250
You're talking to me, aren't you?

2404
02:26:07,810 --> 02:26:08,330
for you.

2405
02:26:08,870 --> 02:26:11,030
Leafless, I know you'll be very interested in.

2406
02:26:12,250 --> 02:26:15,070
I urge you to pursue or peruse it thoroughly.

2407
02:26:15,810 --> 02:26:17,290
Examine it in detail.

2408
02:26:18,550 --> 02:26:19,850
Never mind that right now.

2409
02:26:20,190 --> 02:26:21,350
Do you remember your name?

2410
02:26:22,390 --> 02:26:23,210
My name.

2411
02:26:24,070 --> 02:26:25,070
My name.

2412
02:26:27,730 --> 02:26:32,410
What does my name matter when there are more important
things to worry about?

2413
02:26:32,970 --> 02:26:34,290
She speaks for the rocks.

2414
02:26:35,170 --> 02:26:35,730
Okay.

2415
02:26:36,610 --> 02:26:45,290
Come now and study these trucks with me my brother come and
learn about the rock of the gods with me the night is no

2416
02:26:45,290 --> 02:26:54,410
longer young as a matter of fact daybreak is approaching but
we are young it only just turned 12 look I don't have time

2417
02:26:54,410 --> 02:27:03,870
to get involved in your way of life but I am interested
about your way of death so let's go back back to four

2418
02:27:03,870 --> 02:27:10,510
minutes before your death oh my god it's been a since we've
since we've done a like this whole stream we haven't we

2419
02:27:10,510 --> 02:27:29,440
haven't gone back in time I think he got crushed by the by
the gods wait this is a long time ago and so I made up my

2420
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:36,940
mind I resolved to live here in the park and defend it okay
and what does that have to do with this rock of the gods you

2421
02:27:36,940 --> 02:27:40,700
mentioned Yeah, 825pm.

2422
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:44,220
You still don't appear to understand.

2423
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:47,080
No wonder this one is probably hard.

2424
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:51,960
It's written quite clearly in the fourth leaflet.

2425
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:53,220
In great detail.

2426
02:27:54,160 --> 02:27:55,760
Excuse me, but I have to use the restroom.

2427
02:27:58,840 --> 02:28:01,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2428
02:28:04,510 --> 02:28:05,910
Oh, this is when she gets kidnapped.

2429
02:28:08,590 --> 02:28:09,430
I'm coming!

2430
02:28:11,450 --> 02:28:12,330
Just one!

2431
02:28:13,750 --> 02:28:15,690
I'll be right there!

2432
02:28:17,670 --> 02:28:17,770
Oh!

2433
02:28:19,690 --> 02:28:21,550
I'm looking in the door at me!

2434
02:28:36,100 --> 02:28:37,360
Oh, oh, he took it!

2435
02:28:37,820 --> 02:28:42,540
Yes, my dear, I'll ever so gently nap her and come right
back to your side.

2436
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:44,680
Dang it, Shaggy.

2437
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:46,440
It's all your fault.

2438
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:48,960
Oh, he's gonna, like, hit the lever, isn't he?

2439
02:28:49,740 --> 02:28:51,100
Good evening, young lady.

2440
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:52,420
Won't you come with me?

2441
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:53,680
Ew!

2442
02:28:54,040 --> 02:28:54,740
Oh my god, sorry.

2443
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:55,640
Oh!

2444
02:28:56,940 --> 02:28:57,380
Shaggy!

2445
02:28:59,140 --> 02:28:59,860
Oh my god.

2446
02:28:59,980 --> 02:29:00,240
Oh my god.

2447
02:29:00,460 --> 02:29:00,460
Wait.

2448
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:01,440
That guy... Wait.

2449
02:29:01,540 --> 02:29:03,620
The hippie is actually wearing Shaggy's clothes.

2450
02:29:04,920 --> 02:29:05,740
Oh, guys.

2451
02:29:05,820 --> 02:29:06,560
What do I do?

2452
02:29:06,660 --> 02:29:07,260
What should I do?

2453
02:29:07,380 --> 02:29:08,140
I have to do something.

2454
02:29:10,040 --> 02:29:10,260
Oh!

2455
02:29:10,840 --> 02:29:11,280
Oh!

2456
02:29:24,930 --> 02:29:26,490
Is this where she died?

2457
02:29:31,770 --> 02:29:32,610
Oh my god.

2458
02:29:32,750 --> 02:29:32,990
Wait.

2459
02:29:33,410 --> 02:29:34,910
We have to ghost trick.

2460
02:29:36,590 --> 02:29:51,830
We have to ghost trick to stop someone else's ghost trick no
way what in the world just happened oh that's Mino Mino Mino

2461
02:29:51,830 --> 02:29:59,370
the mascot the symbol of Temsik Park forget about the name
of that big creepy lump above concrete talking about the way

2462
02:29:59,370 --> 02:30:05,930
it changed direction did you see that yes yes I did and we
witnessed it with our eyes.

2463
02:30:06,150 --> 02:30:07,430
The power of the rock of the gods.

2464
02:30:08,790 --> 02:30:10,030
That was the power of the gods.

2465
02:30:10,330 --> 02:30:12,230
The power of the gods saved that little girl.

2466
02:30:13,230 --> 02:30:16,730
And then that same power very deliberately crushed you
instead?

2467
02:30:18,250 --> 02:30:19,950
You gotta ghost the ghost trick.

2468
02:30:21,150 --> 02:30:22,110
Yes, yes precisely.

2469
02:30:22,730 --> 02:30:24,490
That is called the mischief of the gods.

2470
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:28,010
This is how Shaggy's parents met.

2471
02:30:32,050 --> 02:30:32,530
What?

2472
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:48,600
It couldn't have been a ghost trick.

2473
02:30:48,700 --> 02:30:52,560
No ghost trick could change the direction of something that
heavy in mid-air.

2474
02:30:55,860 --> 02:30:56,420
But wait a minute.

2475
02:30:57,400 --> 02:30:59,860
What if there was somebody with much greater powers than me?

2476
02:31:17,630 --> 02:31:19,850
There's another flame besides mine!

2477
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:24,790
Oh, is that the flame of a god, is it?

2478
02:31:25,790 --> 02:31:26,650
But hold on.

2479
02:31:28,390 --> 02:31:30,270
Your spirit is a flame, too, isn't it?

2480
02:31:31,050 --> 02:31:31,710
Yeah, so?

2481
02:31:32,530 --> 02:31:34,410
Oh, pardon me, but are you a god?

2482
02:31:34,470 --> 02:31:35,790
I knew he was gonna ask that.

2483
02:31:36,590 --> 02:31:37,690
Because I read the script.

2484
02:31:38,430 --> 02:31:40,970
I sincerely doubt it.

2485
02:31:41,290 --> 02:31:41,730
Brother!

2486
02:31:42,770 --> 02:31:46,330
The last minute that big lump of concrete made a huge swing
to one side.

2487
02:31:47,270 --> 02:31:48,570
That was probably that Flame's doing.

2488
02:31:49,570 --> 02:31:50,350
Who could it be?

2489
02:31:50,930 --> 02:31:52,190
It's not Missile, is it?

2490
02:31:52,690 --> 02:31:55,970
I definitely believe it's either a god or somebody
god-related.

2491
02:31:57,250 --> 02:31:59,090
Maybe I'd better try talking to this person.

2492
02:32:02,370 --> 02:32:03,210
Here we go.

2493
02:32:05,770 --> 02:32:06,730
What the?

2494
02:32:07,530 --> 02:32:09,410
This person with much greater powers than me.

2495
02:32:09,950 --> 02:32:10,630
It's...

2496
02:32:10,630 --> 02:32:11,030
Missile?

2497
02:32:12,010 --> 02:32:12,370
You?

2498
02:32:13,710 --> 02:32:14,290
Hey!

2499
02:32:19,690 --> 02:32:20,370
Sizzle!

2500
02:32:21,730 --> 02:32:23,090
It's Missile!

2501
02:32:25,050 --> 02:32:27,050
Wait, does that mean Missile's dead?

2502
02:32:28,130 --> 02:32:28,630
Uh oh.

2503
02:32:29,350 --> 02:32:30,830
Wait, does that mean Missile's dead?

2504
02:32:32,010 --> 02:32:33,810
Oh my, it's...

2505
02:32:33,810 --> 02:32:34,410
Missile!

2506
02:32:35,630 --> 02:32:37,230
You look well for being dead.

2507
02:32:37,830 --> 02:32:38,690
Did you see?

2508
02:32:39,010 --> 02:32:39,990
Did you see what I did?

2509
02:32:40,730 --> 02:32:41,210
I did it!

2510
02:32:41,390 --> 02:32:43,190
I tried really hard and I did it!

2511
02:32:43,450 --> 02:32:44,690
I saved Miss Camilla!

2512
02:32:45,750 --> 02:32:46,770
What is done?

2513
02:32:47,490 --> 02:32:49,590
Are you telling me I was done in by a puppy dog?

2514
02:32:50,590 --> 02:32:51,890
Missile, what's going on?

2515
02:32:52,110 --> 02:32:53,390
How did you get the powers of the dead?

2516
02:32:54,850 --> 02:32:56,550
Yeah, I'm glad you asked!

2517
02:32:58,590 --> 02:33:00,610
After Miss Camilla went out and you left?

2518
02:33:01,850 --> 02:33:03,350
Run, run, run, Missile!

2519
02:33:04,350 --> 02:33:06,170
Yeah, Missile's back, Missile!

2520
02:33:08,110 --> 02:33:12,230
Misso, Misso, I worked like crazy to make my own path and I
did it!

2521
02:33:15,750 --> 02:33:16,510
Misso, oh!

2522
02:33:17,690 --> 02:33:18,490
Smart dog.

2523
02:33:19,650 --> 02:33:20,250
Smart dog.

2524
02:33:20,770 --> 02:33:23,770
And then I followed Miss Camilla out into the big wide
world!

2525
02:33:31,050 --> 02:33:32,130
Oh my god, this is where it happened.

2526
02:33:33,330 --> 02:33:35,970
And then, here at this park, I found her alas!

2527
02:33:36,530 --> 02:33:37,910
Yes, you guessed it, I barked!

2528
02:33:38,090 --> 02:33:40,190
You bet I did, and I went running after her too!

2529
02:33:55,050 --> 02:33:58,610
And then I guess I died.

2530
02:34:00,670 --> 02:34:01,230
Missile.

2531
02:34:04,610 --> 02:34:05,730
Missile.

2532
02:34:06,910 --> 02:34:08,030
Missile.

2533
02:34:08,750 --> 02:34:09,310
Missile.

2534
02:34:10,150 --> 02:34:10,710
Missile.

2535
02:34:11,270 --> 02:34:12,190
Missile.

2536
02:34:12,770 --> 02:34:16,370
And then I was unconscious for a little while.

2537
02:34:17,730 --> 02:34:19,090
Shaggy killed Missile.

2538
02:34:22,050 --> 02:34:29,550
then when i came to it was all over poor poor miss camilla
crushed underneath that big scary lump

2539
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:46,160
oh what am i doing i'm so sorry little lady please forgive
me shaggy you must pay take me instead miss camilla

2540
02:34:50,340 --> 02:35:02,420
i had to rescue miss camilla it was up to me i cried out
from the depths of my heart and then oh I can't tell you how

2541
02:35:02,420 --> 02:35:10,480
surprised I was but I bet you understand right better than
probably anybody else could and then I remembered what you

2542
02:35:10,480 --> 02:35:18,140
did for me how you saved me so you went back right back to
four minutes before my wait that means Camilla and Missal

2543
02:35:18,140 --> 02:35:27,000
are able to communicate with each other Shaggy I hope...

2544
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,100
I hope... I hope you never...

2545
02:35:29,100 --> 02:35:32,000
I hope the blue lady never smiles at you ever again.

2546
02:35:33,460 --> 02:35:34,340
You went back, right?

2547
02:35:34,340 --> 02:35:34,500
Right?

2548
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:36,860
Back to four minutes before the little lady's death.

2549
02:35:37,740 --> 02:35:38,960
You bet I did!

2550
02:35:41,360 --> 02:35:43,140
Yeah, and that's why Camilla has a core.

2551
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:44,420
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

2552
02:35:49,880 --> 02:35:53,180
Yes, my knee are all over so gently, nab her, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

2553
02:35:53,460 --> 02:35:54,340
We've heard this before.

2554
02:35:55,260 --> 02:35:56,400
Then he says, come with me!

2555
02:35:59,100 --> 02:35:59,460
Awful.

2556
02:35:59,700 --> 02:36:00,360
I hate you, Shaggy.

2557
02:36:00,740 --> 02:36:01,480
I hate you, Shaggy.

2558
02:36:01,940 --> 02:36:03,080
I hate you, Shaggy.

2559
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:10,640
Now's my chance.

2560
02:36:11,260 --> 02:36:12,580
I thought I saw the core.

2561
02:36:13,140 --> 02:36:14,140
Oh, now's my chance, I thought.

2562
02:36:14,280 --> 02:36:14,980
I saw the core.

2563
02:36:15,720 --> 02:36:16,000
I don't know.

2564
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:16,980
It looks pretty far.

2565
02:36:17,640 --> 02:36:19,720
I stretched out my paw towards the core.

2566
02:36:20,500 --> 02:36:20,840
Oh, wow.

2567
02:36:20,900 --> 02:36:21,960
I felt that moment.

2568
02:36:22,760 --> 02:36:24,760
I'd love for you to be able to feel it, too.

2569
02:36:25,480 --> 02:36:26,120
Go ahead, Sissel.

2570
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:27,780
Go ahead and try it for yourself.

2571
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:30,180
Whoa!

2572
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:33,000
I can't believe it.

2573
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:37,200
How you... how could you connect over such a great distance?

2574
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:40,460
Well, they don't call me Missle for nothing.

2575
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:47,040
And so, then you manipulated that Mino thing and threw it
aside.

2576
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:49,180
Right on top of my head.

2577
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:52,200
Well, uh, no, actually.

2578
02:36:53,100 --> 02:36:53,300
Hmm?

2579
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:56,860
I can't manipulate things like you can, Sissel.

2580
02:36:57,300 --> 02:36:58,300
You can't?

2581
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:00,120
How did you...

2582
02:37:00,120 --> 02:37:01,360
I don't know what to...

2583
02:37:01,360 --> 02:37:02,320
I didn't know what to do.

2584
02:37:02,740 --> 02:37:05,200
Then I happened to see something out of the corner of my
eye.

2585
02:37:06,480 --> 02:37:07,900
And it had a core too!

2586
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:12,640
A single leaf hanging from the tree.

2587
02:37:13,640 --> 02:37:17,980
So is Missile's ghost powers like...

2588
02:37:17,980 --> 02:37:20,060
Able to manipulate...

2589
02:37:20,060 --> 02:37:20,980
Like connect a thing.

2590
02:37:21,100 --> 02:37:22,460
So it kind of like swung.

2591
02:37:22,900 --> 02:37:23,640
Like his...

2592
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:25,540
His power is this...

2593
02:37:25,540 --> 02:37:27,100
He like...

2594
02:37:27,100 --> 02:37:27,920
Swapping.

2595
02:37:28,080 --> 02:37:28,900
Oh, maybe swapping.

2596
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:30,380
Oh, I don't know.

2597
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:30,820
Let's see.

2598
02:37:31,340 --> 02:37:33,260
I thought he, like, had it swing over there.

2599
02:37:34,660 --> 02:37:36,000
I tried reaching out to the leaf.

2600
02:37:40,200 --> 02:37:40,800
What in the world?

2601
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:43,140
I can't manipulate things.

2602
02:37:43,580 --> 02:37:44,000
But apparently...

2603
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,540
Oh, he swapped them.

2604
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:48,920
As long as the two things have the same shape that...

2605
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:49,740
Oh.

2606
02:37:50,260 --> 02:37:52,700
That is so specific.

2607
02:37:54,380 --> 02:37:56,200
Swap things with the same shape.

2608
02:37:57,100 --> 02:37:58,220
Go ahead and try it.

2609
02:37:58,320 --> 02:37:58,960
First swap.

2610
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:04,160
So now...

2611
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:05,040
That's incredible!

2612
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:09,460
Oh my gosh, this late into the game they're introducing a
new game mechanic.

2613
02:38:09,620 --> 02:38:10,920
No wonder this puzzle is so difficult.

2614
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:13,940
So that's how you saved your mistress, is it?

2615
02:38:14,820 --> 02:38:17,080
And that's how I became caught up in this, is it?

2616
02:38:18,100 --> 02:38:19,100
I'm very sorry.

2617
02:38:20,200 --> 02:38:21,720
My powers were too meager.

2618
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:23,240
Meager.

2619
02:38:24,060 --> 02:38:25,960
Because you see, I saw one more...

2620
02:38:27,500 --> 02:38:27,960
Oh!

2621
02:38:28,480 --> 02:38:28,940
Oh!

2622
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:32,000
I happen to notice one more core.

2623
02:38:32,920 --> 02:38:36,780
There was something with the exact same shape stuck in the
branches of a tree.

2624
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:38,320
You're right.

2625
02:38:38,620 --> 02:38:39,600
It's the rugby ball.

2626
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:42,040
Mino could be swapped again with that.

2627
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:46,480
Then disaster wouldn't have to rain down on my head.

2628
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,080
But what is that thing?

2629
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:51,740
It's too big to be a leaf.

2630
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:55,480
Whatever it is, I'd much prefer it on my head than Mino.

2631
02:38:57,500 --> 02:39:00,020
So why didn't you swap them, Mr. It's too far.

2632
02:39:00,280 --> 02:39:01,240
I couldn't.

2633
02:39:01,240 --> 02:39:04,300
I could stretch out my paw a little further than you can,
Sissel.

2634
02:39:05,420 --> 02:39:05,860
Aww.

2635
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:09,340
But this was just too far for me.

2636
02:39:09,440 --> 02:39:10,360
I couldn't reach.

2637
02:39:14,160 --> 02:39:14,840
Da-dang.

2638
02:39:19,770 --> 02:39:22,510
No, it's not a beehive with the rugby ball.

2639
02:39:22,930 --> 02:39:23,510
Oh, sorry.

2640
02:39:24,730 --> 02:39:27,190
I must admit, it's a fascinating spectacle of a death.

2641
02:39:27,530 --> 02:39:28,770
If I do say so myself.

2642
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:35,860
Oh well.

2643
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:40,180
I kept retrying over and over, seeing if there was anything
I could do.

2644
02:39:41,080 --> 02:39:42,840
But there's something you can do now.

2645
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:43,500
Hmm?

2646
02:39:44,340 --> 02:39:45,820
If we work together, you and me.

2647
02:39:46,600 --> 02:39:47,660
Cecil, you think so?

2648
02:39:49,620 --> 02:39:52,100
Wait, but then, but can we...

2649
02:39:52,100 --> 02:39:53,820
Can we save Missile?

2650
02:39:54,700 --> 02:39:57,460
I don't plan on letting anybody die in front of me tonight.

2651
02:39:58,640 --> 02:39:59,800
Do you think you could help me?

2652
02:40:00,540 --> 02:40:01,460
Of course!

2653
02:40:02,780 --> 02:40:03,240
Naturally!

2654
02:40:04,700 --> 02:40:12,440
to drop that mino thing in a different spot okay let's try
it let's go back again to four minutes before wait we have

2655
02:40:12,440 --> 02:40:30,640
to save miss i swear if she goes back if we go back to the
present she's alive and everything and oh wait though no

2656
02:40:32,680 --> 02:40:40,540
because she'll have already been kidnapped but if if
missal's just there lying in that in that pool in that poor

2657
02:40:40,540 --> 02:40:41,060
ditch.

2658
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:42,700
I'll be so sad.

2659
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:44,240
Let's get started.

2660
02:40:45,860 --> 02:40:48,200
Four minutes from now, you'll swap Mina with the leaf.

2661
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:50,660
And then you'll have to swap Mina with something else.

2662
02:40:52,400 --> 02:40:53,760
Something with the same shape.

2663
02:40:54,760 --> 02:40:56,220
Oh, I believe that's a rugby ball.

2664
02:40:57,080 --> 02:40:58,280
Okay, a rugby ball, huh?

2665
02:40:58,820 --> 02:41:01,600
But with the rugby ball, where it is now, Missile can't
reach it.

2666
02:41:01,980 --> 02:41:03,800
So that means we have to move it closer somehow.

2667
02:41:04,540 --> 02:41:07,280
Looks like you and I will have to work together on that one,
Missile.

2668
02:41:10,100 --> 02:41:14,400
Whenever you want to use my swap trick, just press Z-R.

2669
02:41:14,780 --> 02:41:16,340
Okay, Z-R.

2670
02:41:18,280 --> 02:41:19,900
That way, you'll be able to control me.

2671
02:41:20,760 --> 02:41:25,340
And then if you press Z-R, control will come back to me.

2672
02:41:25,800 --> 02:41:27,360
Okay, let's try it.

2673
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:29,700
Together we can stop Mino from hurting anybody.

2674
02:41:31,220 --> 02:41:32,240
Trick time.

2675
02:41:34,880 --> 02:41:35,780
Alright, Missile.

2676
02:41:36,120 --> 02:41:37,480
Your powers are the key this time.

2677
02:41:38,100 --> 02:41:38,940
Okay, I'm ready.

2678
02:41:39,160 --> 02:41:41,220
I can swap anything that has the same shape.

2679
02:41:41,700 --> 02:41:43,080
Just call on me if you want to...

2680
02:41:43,080 --> 02:41:44,200
If you find anything, you want to try.

2681
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:47,880
Best thing to do is try and find a bunch of things and see
how it goes.

2682
02:41:49,280 --> 02:41:50,080
Use the R.

2683
02:41:50,240 --> 02:41:51,440
Alright, let's head back.

2684
02:41:54,160 --> 02:41:54,520
Open.

2685
02:42:07,470 --> 02:42:07,830
Uh...

2686
02:42:08,330 --> 02:42:08,930
Oh, wait.

2687
02:42:09,170 --> 02:42:09,770
Oh, there we go.

2688
02:42:10,230 --> 02:42:13,390
Oh, here he comes, here he comes.

2689
02:42:13,690 --> 02:42:13,990
Uh-oh.

2690
02:42:14,830 --> 02:42:15,910
Time is passing.

2691
02:42:16,210 --> 02:42:17,430
Oh, no, wait.

2692
02:42:18,810 --> 02:42:19,170
Um...

2693
02:42:19,270 --> 02:42:21,050
Wait, so can I swap the...

2694
02:42:21,050 --> 02:42:22,370
Let's see, Z-R.

2695
02:42:24,730 --> 02:42:27,090
Oh, and he can move further, too.

2696
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:27,990
Yo!

2697
02:42:28,850 --> 02:42:30,050
That's so crazy.

2698
02:42:31,890 --> 02:42:32,270
Okay.

2699
02:42:33,670 --> 02:42:37,130
Maybe swap the basketball and that.

2700
02:42:37,930 --> 02:42:39,990
Oh, wait, but I'm in the baseball.

2701
02:42:40,330 --> 02:42:41,210
They're the same shape.

2702
02:42:42,510 --> 02:42:45,650
I think we need to...

2703
02:42:46,650 --> 02:42:48,210
Wait, how do I swap them?

2704
02:42:55,360 --> 02:43:03,560
Oh wait, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Swap What
does that do anything?

2705
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:09,580
Because I'm still here That didn't really help me Hold

2706
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:25,900
on Oh now it's too heavy Maybe because of the swap I made I
guess the little ball is about all the way I can handle Okay

2707
02:43:26,780 --> 02:43:33,600
Let's go ghost ZR Swap them back Let's swap the, uh...

2708
02:43:37,400 --> 02:43:39,880
Let's swap the, um...

2709
02:43:39,880 --> 02:43:40,420
Tire?

2710
02:43:41,540 --> 02:43:42,320
Oh my god.

2711
02:43:43,940 --> 02:43:46,260
Oh wait, uh, we'll stay here.

2712
02:43:46,420 --> 02:43:47,040
Z-R.

2713
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:50,700
Oh wait, no.

2714
02:43:51,360 --> 02:43:51,720
Oh wait.

2715
02:43:54,180 --> 02:43:54,640
Hmm.

2716
02:43:54,640 --> 02:43:55,900
Okay, let's just see what else there.

2717
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,080
Oh my god, he's just there.

2718
02:43:58,460 --> 02:43:59,720
There's also the love letter.

2719
02:44:05,740 --> 02:44:07,300
Look at this funny flattened

2720
02:44:12,060 --> 02:44:14,180
It's the same shape as that horrible Mino!

2721
02:44:14,860 --> 02:44:15,980
That's too far to swap from him.

2722
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:18,460
Even this ball is starting to look horrible to me.

2723
02:44:19,520 --> 02:44:20,720
You have to find a way to get it closer.

2724
02:44:21,420 --> 02:44:22,540
Knock it down from the tree, I say.

2725
02:44:23,060 --> 02:44:24,640
There must be something we can do.

2726
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:28,180
Time is passing.

2727
02:44:29,160 --> 02:44:32,740
And then he flies all his things around.

2728
02:44:33,500 --> 02:44:34,020
Oh man.

2729
02:44:35,180 --> 02:44:36,360
This is so tricky.

2730
02:44:37,640 --> 02:44:38,000
Hmm.

2731
02:44:40,580 --> 02:44:42,100
You're in the Seesaw, aren't you?

2732
02:44:44,460 --> 02:44:45,500
Uh, yes.

2733
02:45:05,270 --> 02:45:06,810
Okay, I can reach this.

2734
02:45:07,250 --> 02:45:08,230
So what if I do this?

2735
02:45:09,290 --> 02:45:16,730
Swap, and then, swap, and then, swap.

2736
02:45:17,770 --> 02:45:19,270
Okay, that should be it.

2737
02:45:19,270 --> 02:45:20,030
That should be it.

2738
02:45:21,350 --> 02:45:24,630
Now we, uh, oh, we need the Seesaw to move back.

2739
02:45:25,850 --> 02:45:26,710
Oh my gosh, please.

2740
02:45:26,870 --> 02:45:27,150
Move.

2741
02:45:27,430 --> 02:45:27,990
There we go.

2742
02:45:28,690 --> 02:45:29,430
And we go...

2743
02:45:29,430 --> 02:45:29,990
Oh, there we go.

2744
02:45:31,030 --> 02:45:31,290
No!

2745
02:45:31,590 --> 02:45:31,910
Ah!

2746
02:45:32,270 --> 02:45:33,690
Oh, oh, oh!

2747
02:45:34,210 --> 02:45:34,570
Okay.

2748
02:45:37,530 --> 02:45:37,890
Maybe...

2749
02:45:37,890 --> 02:45:40,430
Oh, maybe we have it so he doesn't...

2750
02:45:41,870 --> 02:45:43,730
What do you think of my lightning fast pace?

2751
02:45:46,850 --> 02:45:48,270
I wish he wouldn't knock it off.

2752
02:45:48,330 --> 02:45:49,350
I wish he would knock it off.

2753
02:45:49,410 --> 02:45:50,050
That's what I think.

2754
02:45:50,150 --> 02:45:51,850
We don't have time to prepare.

2755
02:45:52,330 --> 02:45:54,430
I think we're going to have to find a way to stop him from
running.

2756
02:45:56,370 --> 02:45:56,730
So...

2757
02:45:58,250 --> 02:46:00,310
Maybe we stop him from using the thing.

2758
02:46:00,550 --> 02:46:02,150
The seesaw, the swing, those things!

2759
02:46:02,870 --> 02:46:03,330
Precisely.

2760
02:46:03,570 --> 02:46:06,050
Except there are one more piece of equipment, to be exact.

2761
02:46:06,770 --> 02:46:08,050
Stop him with the equipment, eh?

2762
02:46:08,430 --> 02:46:09,890
Maybe I should rethink things here.

2763
02:46:10,470 --> 02:46:11,010
Well, hold on.

2764
02:46:11,110 --> 02:46:12,730
I'm still trying to...

2765
02:46:13,390 --> 02:46:14,710
Get over here.

2766
02:46:18,820 --> 02:46:19,280
Talk.

2767
02:46:19,560 --> 02:46:20,360
Why am I talking?

2768
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:22,100
Oh no!

2769
02:46:22,300 --> 02:46:22,480
Wait!

2770
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:23,220
Oh, I forgot.

2771
02:46:23,280 --> 02:46:24,240
Missile was in the baseball!

2772
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:26,200
This is so confusing.

2773
02:46:28,100 --> 02:46:29,200
ball is still in the tree.

2774
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:30,280
I know.

2775
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:32,360
There isn't much more time.

2776
02:46:34,380 --> 02:46:38,580
I wonder if maybe the... Well, I don't think knocking the...

2777
02:46:39,220 --> 02:46:43,880
I don't think knocking the rugby ball with, like, a
basketball.

2778
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:45,760
I don't think getting it on the ground is helpful.

2779
02:46:48,180 --> 02:46:50,180
I have to find a way somehow.

2780
02:46:51,600 --> 02:46:51,820
Okay.

2781
02:46:52,180 --> 02:46:53,060
You move there.

2782
02:46:54,060 --> 02:46:54,920
You move there.

2783
02:46:59,490 --> 02:47:06,370
Oh, I'm still too short okay and

2784
02:47:12,730 --> 02:47:20,590
the swing we can't make it oh this one's really hard okay um

2785
02:47:24,110 --> 02:47:34,210
i feel like we need the tire oh the tire needs to go either
in here to make it too heavy for him to spin around or on

2786
02:47:34,210 --> 02:47:48,790
here to make it so he can he can't lift up hmm but it's also
timing because we need him to be on the swing so that we can

2787
02:47:48,790 --> 02:47:58,490
well do we need to connect to the swing maybe we don't oh
this one's tricky oh the balls are very important for the

2788
02:47:58,490 --> 02:48:02,730
puzzle yeah I can tell I've gathered that much

2789
02:48:28,750 --> 02:48:30,630
hmm hmm

2790
02:48:36,220 --> 02:48:39,680
Because, do I stop him from getting over here, like they
said?

2791
02:48:40,080 --> 02:48:42,800
Or do I get the rugby ball out of the tree?

2792
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:48,420
Is the question.

2793
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:55,860
Hmm.

2794
02:48:56,400 --> 02:48:57,780
I think you missed your chance at this point.

2795
02:48:57,960 --> 02:48:58,400
I agree.

2796
02:48:59,660 --> 02:49:00,220
I agree.

2797
02:49:00,640 --> 02:49:02,040
No, I think so, too.

2798
02:49:04,880 --> 02:49:08,300
But, I think I'm still trying to cook a little bit.

2799
02:49:09,380 --> 02:49:11,280
I'm trying to...

2800
02:49:11,300 --> 02:49:14,260
I think it's probably easier to just do though, you know?

2801
02:49:16,700 --> 02:49:19,200
Because I can't even get over here!

2802
02:49:24,490 --> 02:49:26,630
So I think it has to be...

2803
02:49:28,790 --> 02:49:29,830
Oh, unless...

2804
02:49:29,830 --> 02:49:32,150
Okay, I'm possessing a ball.

2805
02:49:33,250 --> 02:49:34,090
Well, hmm.

2806
02:49:38,380 --> 02:49:43,160
I have to be able to possess a ball, I think, to be able
to...

2807
02:49:43,980 --> 02:49:45,880
When it gets launched in the air...

2808
02:49:47,020 --> 02:49:47,620
Right?

2809
02:49:48,920 --> 02:49:52,060
I think I have to possess something.

2810
02:49:52,360 --> 02:49:53,420
Maybe the basketball.

2811
02:49:54,180 --> 02:49:55,440
Okay, I'm just gonna restart.

2812
02:49:57,020 --> 02:49:58,080
I'm just gonna restart.

2813
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:03,780
And we'll try swapping the balls a little bit.

2814
02:50:05,240 --> 02:50:06,440
Oh man.

2815
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:06,960
Okay.

2816
02:50:07,840 --> 02:50:08,200
Let's go.

2817
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:13,560
Open.

2818
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:14,600
Sesame.

2819
02:50:17,420 --> 02:50:18,020
Okay.

2820
02:50:18,160 --> 02:50:18,360
Okay.

2821
02:50:18,380 --> 02:50:29,820
if I may backseat for a moment I would advise simply solving
the puzzle oh thank you you're so right you are so right

2822
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:45,300
where does a tire go oh we have to stop him from running but
I think he'll still try to spin so let's put the tire oh oh

2823
02:50:45,300 --> 02:50:57,120
no let's let's stay in the lid okay let's swap the tire okay
the baseball will swap these and then the tire I'm gonna

2824
02:50:57,120 --> 02:51:15,420
swap hello why can't I swap it oh oh I'm silly there we go

2825
02:51:15,420 --> 02:51:27,920

attempt this oh and now you get out of there we're just

2826
02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:40,680

2828
02:51:58,830 --> 02:52:21,790

2829
02:52:21,790 --> 02:52:22,230
Okay.

2830
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:30,460
No, no, no.

2831
02:52:31,340 --> 02:52:32,280
No, no, no.

2832
02:52:35,380 --> 02:52:36,160
There we go, there we go.

2833
02:52:36,560 --> 02:52:36,720
Swap.

2834
02:52:37,260 --> 02:52:37,700
Okay.

2835
02:52:38,200 --> 02:52:38,540
CR.

2836
02:52:39,800 --> 02:52:40,260
There we go.

2837
02:52:40,900 --> 02:52:41,760
Okay, okay, okay, yeah.

2838
02:52:44,200 --> 02:52:45,420
Here you come already.

2839
02:52:46,260 --> 02:52:48,220
I swore to myself not to repeat my mistakes.

2840
02:52:49,080 --> 02:52:49,280
Mistakes?

2841
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:52,000
When somebody is in trouble, you should lend them a hand.

2842
02:52:52,380 --> 02:52:53,920
Otherwise, you'll definitely regret it.

2843
02:52:54,380 --> 02:52:58,380
And now the recklessness of youth has taken over, giving me
lightning-fast speed.

2844
02:52:59,340 --> 02:53:05,260
I've been thinking If we could stop this man from running
Maybe he wouldn't get squished It won't be easy to stop me

2845
02:53:05,260 --> 02:53:09,400
once the recklessness of youth has taken over Stop him, eh?

2846
02:53:09,540 --> 02:53:13,420
Okay, so maybe now things are heavy enough Right?

2847
02:53:16,160 --> 02:53:19,820
Okay, he's not going so fast I think

2848
02:53:23,300 --> 02:53:34,840
Oh no, no, I thought I would be able to Oh Oh, I thought I'd
be able to move while I was launched, but I couldn't move.

2849
02:53:35,100 --> 02:53:35,980
Now I'm stuck.

2850
02:53:40,780 --> 02:53:41,940
Uh, okay.

2851
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:44,080
Well, there was an attempt.

2852
02:53:49,780 --> 02:53:51,160
There was an attempt.

2853
02:54:00,300 --> 02:54:01,800
Time to throw in the trowel.

2854
02:54:03,820 --> 02:54:04,400
Yes.

2855
02:54:05,780 --> 02:54:06,820
Okay, let's retry.

2856
02:54:09,180 --> 02:54:09,760
Okay.

2857
02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:24,200
Hmm...

2858
02:54:24,200 --> 02:54:24,760
Okay.

2859
02:54:30,140 --> 02:54:33,460
Maybe the tire needs to be on here then.

2860
02:54:48,400 --> 02:54:48,920
There.

2861
02:54:49,220 --> 02:54:49,860
Oh, no.

2862
02:54:50,900 --> 02:54:51,320
No!

2863
02:54:52,340 --> 02:54:52,860
No!

2864
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:54,500
Oh my goodness.

2865
02:54:58,840 --> 02:54:58,880
What?

2866
02:54:59,100 --> 02:54:59,520
Why?

2867
02:55:08,110 --> 02:55:11,350
Remember that your goal is to swap the statue with the ball,
not to stop him.

2868
02:55:11,970 --> 02:55:22,370
that I just need I think when the baseball gets launched
like it just sucks when I get launched I can't I can't ghost

2869
02:55:22,370 --> 02:55:32,630
trick so when I'm in the air I can't get up there you know
and we can't do anything with the with the balloon I'm

2870
02:55:32,630 --> 02:55:37,250
trying to think of any other shapes that are similar but
like the umbrella even when folded is not similar to

2871
02:55:37,250 --> 02:55:38,390
anything else.

2872
02:55:40,990 --> 02:55:42,590
And we can't reach that.

2873
02:55:47,050 --> 02:55:48,630
No, please, stop.

2874
02:55:49,050 --> 02:55:49,430
No.

2875
02:55:50,350 --> 02:55:51,290
Please, let me...

2876
02:55:51,290 --> 02:55:52,570
You know what, Sissel, get out of the way.

2877
02:55:53,210 --> 02:55:54,110
You go here.

2878
02:55:55,450 --> 02:55:55,690
Wait.

2879
02:55:55,950 --> 02:55:56,910
Yeah, you go here.

2880
02:55:59,990 --> 02:56:00,710
Oh, my God.

2881
02:56:01,010 --> 02:56:02,370
I'm going to become the Joker.

2882
02:56:02,770 --> 02:56:03,630
I'm going to become the Joker.

2883
02:56:04,010 --> 02:56:04,490
Please.

2884
02:56:05,710 --> 02:56:19,630

2885
02:56:34,250 --> 02:56:41,010
oh thank god holy moly

2886
02:56:44,510 --> 02:56:46,690
oh yeah we have to wait

2887
02:56:50,190 --> 02:56:51,390
No, no, no.

2888
02:56:53,070 --> 02:56:54,370
Put you here.

2889
02:56:55,610 --> 02:56:57,470
We're just gonna readjust a few things.

2890
02:56:59,110 --> 02:56:59,590
Maybe...

2891
02:57:00,570 --> 02:57:03,790
Maybe because it spins so fast, we put the ball in there.

2892
02:57:04,350 --> 02:57:06,090
The baseball might launch.

2893
02:57:06,690 --> 02:57:09,610
Maybe it will launch from the globe.

2894
02:57:11,250 --> 02:57:12,270
He'll spin really fast.

2895
02:57:12,390 --> 02:57:23,930
It will launch from the globe, and maybe it will hit the
rugby ball, from there who knows but with the tire here oh

2896
02:57:28,180 --> 02:57:37,660
wait i think i realized i need to well let's uh i think i

2897
02:57:37,660 --> 02:57:42,600

02:57:47,710 --> 02:57:53,850
order of operations wait um oh yeah oh

2899
02:57:57,770 --> 02:58:02,330
Can you spin the climbing frame fast when he's on it?

2900
02:58:03,630 --> 02:58:06,910
Oh, oh yeah, we can try, right?

2901
02:58:08,690 --> 02:58:09,130
Hold on.

2902
02:58:09,830 --> 02:58:11,130
The order of operation, wait.

2903
02:58:11,970 --> 02:58:13,610
My brain hurts.

2904
02:58:13,970 --> 02:58:14,210
Oh.

2905
02:58:17,610 --> 02:58:20,050
Because I want the ball.

2906
02:58:20,290 --> 02:58:21,050
Oh, okay, hold on.

2907
02:58:21,370 --> 02:58:22,950
Okay, let's switch these back again.

2908
02:58:24,010 --> 02:58:25,370
No, please.

2909
02:58:25,550 --> 02:58:26,110
No, please.

2910
02:58:26,910 --> 02:58:27,190
Okay.

2911
02:58:27,850 --> 02:58:28,730
There we go.

2912
02:58:29,230 --> 02:58:29,230
Switch.

2913
02:58:29,790 --> 02:58:31,070
Even though it took me so long.

2914
02:58:32,150 --> 02:58:33,670
It's like to switch it before.

2915
02:58:34,910 --> 02:58:35,230
Cancel.

2916
02:58:36,950 --> 02:58:37,550
Cancel.

2917
02:58:40,130 --> 02:58:41,210
Go there.

2918
02:58:46,720 --> 02:58:47,120
Oh, oops.

2919
02:58:47,300 --> 02:58:47,780
There we go.

2920
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:51,240
Oh.

2921
02:58:51,620 --> 02:58:53,860
My brain is hurting a little bit.

2922
02:58:55,700 --> 02:58:55,900
Okay.

2923
02:58:56,040 --> 02:58:57,040
Basketball here.

2924
02:59:01,340 --> 02:59:02,540
And now...

2925
02:59:04,560 --> 02:59:05,180
Switch.

2926
02:59:05,720 --> 02:59:05,720
Okay.

2927
02:59:06,120 --> 02:59:07,260
So let's try this.

2928
02:59:10,740 --> 02:59:11,980
And then...

2929
02:59:11,980 --> 02:59:12,420
Hope.

2930
02:59:21,570 --> 02:59:23,610
Wait, but how do I...

2931
02:59:23,610 --> 02:59:24,690
Oh, no.

2932
02:59:26,590 --> 02:59:28,170
It's too heavy to move.

2933
02:59:29,070 --> 02:59:30,750
I can't get over there.

2934
02:59:34,520 --> 02:59:37,500
Okay, we're gonna have to be the fastest in the West.

2935
02:59:39,060 --> 02:59:41,020
We're gonna have to be the fastest in the West.

2936
02:59:41,140 --> 02:59:41,340
Oh, wait.

2937
02:59:51,770 --> 02:59:52,210
Ghost.

2938
02:59:53,090 --> 02:59:53,510
Ball.

2939
02:59:59,780 --> 03:00:01,920
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move,
move, move.

2940
03:00:03,700 --> 03:00:03,900
Um.

2941
03:00:07,530 --> 03:00:07,970
Um.

2942
03:00:15,390 --> 03:00:15,830
Okay.

2943
03:00:16,670 --> 03:00:18,010
This one took me a while.

2944
03:00:18,390 --> 03:00:18,930
Ah, people.

2945
03:00:19,070 --> 03:00:19,490
Oh, my God.

2946
03:00:19,570 --> 03:00:20,430
He's already on it.

2947
03:00:22,450 --> 03:00:24,030
He's already on it.

2948
03:00:31,600 --> 03:00:32,560
Oh, I still can't.

2949
03:00:32,700 --> 03:00:33,700
Okay, hold on.

2950
03:00:37,260 --> 03:00:38,560
Uh, shoot, shoot, shoot.

2951
03:00:38,900 --> 03:00:45,020
There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go, there we
go, there we go, there we go, there we go.

2952
03:00:45,280 --> 03:00:45,640
Okay.

2953
03:00:48,140 --> 03:00:48,500
Spin!

2954
03:00:48,980 --> 03:00:49,220
Spin!

2955
03:00:49,600 --> 03:00:49,840
Spin!

2956
03:00:50,040 --> 03:00:50,500
Spin it!

2957
03:00:50,700 --> 03:00:51,040
Spin!

2958
03:00:51,360 --> 03:00:51,600
Spin!

2959
03:00:54,580 --> 03:00:55,900
Wow, I didn't see this coming.

2960
03:00:56,060 --> 03:00:56,220
Okay.

2961
03:00:58,060 --> 03:01:00,760
Don't you know about the first thing about the globe, the
globe climber?

2962
03:01:01,480 --> 03:01:01,780
Huh?

2963
03:01:02,700 --> 03:01:05,680
little children treat it with respect with the respect it
deserves.

2964
03:01:06,060 --> 03:01:08,880
They know that unless you spin it gently, there's no
stopping it.

2965
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:10,880
Yeah, it does look pretty dangerous.

2966
03:01:12,080 --> 03:01:14,840
Looks like I'm just destined to fly through the air like
this for a while.

2967
03:01:15,500 --> 03:01:15,860
Hmm.

2968
03:01:16,140 --> 03:01:17,580
This just might buy us some time.

2969
03:01:18,280 --> 03:01:20,880
Maybe he'll just keep spinning around like that for a whole
four minutes.

2970
03:01:21,640 --> 03:01:23,640
I'm sorry, but I don't think I would stand it for that long.

2971
03:01:24,480 --> 03:01:26,800
But anyway, at least we stopped him from running for a
while.

2972
03:01:27,380 --> 03:01:29,520
Let's see what we can do while we have our chance.

2973
03:01:31,740 --> 03:01:32,100
Okay.

2974
03:01:34,060 --> 03:01:35,540
Wait, there's two boots?

2975
03:01:40,300 --> 03:01:41,520
Look at that, there's two boots.

2976
03:01:43,640 --> 03:01:44,300
Okay, great.

2977
03:01:45,540 --> 03:01:47,120
Now, um...

2978
03:01:50,200 --> 03:01:51,440
Now we...

2979
03:01:52,380 --> 03:01:53,000
Uh...

2980
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:53,880
You

2981
03:01:59,280 --> 03:02:01,800
go there.

2982
03:02:03,580 --> 03:02:03,820
Oh!

2983
03:02:06,020 --> 03:02:08,880
Oh my gosh, I can barely...

2984
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:10,200
There we go.

2985
03:02:10,520 --> 03:02:12,580
Okay, we made it!

2986
03:02:14,900 --> 03:02:17,600
All right, wrestle this, just like before.

2987
03:02:19,720 --> 03:02:23,360
Now we can get up here, and we'll close the umbrella.

2988
03:02:26,240 --> 03:02:31,120
And now, that was so close.

2989
03:02:31,800 --> 03:02:33,620
If it hit the ball, it would have knocked it down.

2990
03:02:34,920 --> 03:02:36,740
Is that all this umbrella can be used for?

2991
03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:38,600
For knocking the rugby ball down?

2992
03:02:40,520 --> 03:02:41,300
about my powers.

2993
03:02:42,200 --> 03:02:43,920
Don't forget about my recklessness of youth.

2994
03:02:46,240 --> 03:02:47,020
Open it up.

2995
03:02:52,460 --> 03:02:53,220
Uh-oh.

2996
03:02:53,880 --> 03:02:54,460
Uh-oh.

2997
03:02:54,600 --> 03:02:55,840
Time is passing!

2998
03:02:57,160 --> 03:02:58,260
Did you see the seesaw?

2999
03:02:58,780 --> 03:03:00,720
I guess the tire's too heavy to get that much height.

3000
03:03:03,460 --> 03:03:05,520
I wouldn't have been surprised if it launched me into the
air.

3001
03:03:06,160 --> 03:03:08,260
The tire does have quite a bit of weight to it.

3002
03:03:08,640 --> 03:03:10,560
No matter how heavy it is, I can still swap it.

3003
03:03:15,480 --> 03:03:17,960
Wait, so So, maybe it shouldn't have been the tire.

3004
03:03:20,920 --> 03:03:24,860
Maybe we need him to jump into the air and flip the
umbrella.

3005
03:03:30,420 --> 03:03:31,260
Or something.

3006
03:03:31,920 --> 03:03:32,120
Ah!

3007
03:03:33,620 --> 03:03:33,920
Ah!

3008
03:03:35,500 --> 03:03:36,100
Ah!

3009
03:03:47,420 --> 03:03:50,020
Can he go into the rugby and drop manually?

3010
03:03:50,280 --> 03:03:51,240
No unfortunately.

3011
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:56,240
Unfortunately we cannot.

3012
03:03:59,760 --> 03:04:02,880
I think I have to restart, though.

3013
03:04:07,400 --> 03:04:10,040
It took so long to get here, though.

3014
03:04:12,480 --> 03:04:14,040
Basketball did a perfect arc before.

3015
03:04:14,380 --> 03:04:15,480
Now did it.

3016
03:04:16,100 --> 03:04:16,780
The B-ball.

3017
03:04:20,040 --> 03:04:20,460
Okay.

3018
03:04:22,360 --> 03:04:22,660
Okay.

3019
03:04:22,660 --> 03:04:24,720
So we need to move the...

3020
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:26,480
We need to move...

3021
03:04:27,300 --> 03:04:27,900
The...

3022
03:04:27,900 --> 03:04:28,320
The...

3023
03:04:29,080 --> 03:04:30,780
baseball wait no

3024
03:04:39,310 --> 03:04:49,010
but we still need the baseball in here so we're just
swapping the baseball and the basketball then is that it we

3025
03:04:49,010 --> 03:04:50,630
don't have to worry about the tire

3026
03:04:59,040 --> 03:05:01,540
boo thank you

3027
03:05:04,580 --> 03:05:23,200
I think I have to reset I know I think I've already missed
my chance I think I think if by the time he's there, it's

3028
03:05:23,200 --> 03:05:24,560
not completed.

3029
03:05:24,880 --> 03:05:25,620
It's not good.

3030
03:05:26,660 --> 03:05:29,100
I think, uh...

3031
03:05:32,290 --> 03:05:33,810
I think I'm...

3032
03:05:33,810 --> 03:05:34,870
I think I'm not good.

3033
03:05:35,770 --> 03:05:36,010
Right?

3034
03:05:39,180 --> 03:05:40,980
You have everything you need?

3035
03:05:41,120 --> 03:05:41,980
It's just execution.

3036
03:05:44,700 --> 03:05:46,200
I mean, I always had everything I needed.

3037
03:05:51,940 --> 03:05:52,460
Okay.

3038
03:05:54,400 --> 03:05:54,920
Okay.

3039
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:56,000
I'm gonna just retry.

3040
03:05:56,440 --> 03:06:08,320
retry with what we know now so okay and here we're the super
chat i don't know what it said though all right here we go

3041
03:06:08,320 --> 03:06:25,740
oh oh oh whoopsie whoopsie okay here we go la la la la la
move the seesaw into the seabow CISO go back down.

3042
03:06:26,900 --> 03:06:27,820
Here he comes.

3043
03:06:28,060 --> 03:06:28,460
Oh my gosh.

3044
03:06:28,720 --> 03:06:28,960
Already?

3045
03:06:30,280 --> 03:06:30,760
Okay.

3046
03:06:47,320 --> 03:06:48,060
Oh, wait.

3047
03:06:48,520 --> 03:06:51,120
Actually, you go here.

3048
03:06:52,440 --> 03:06:52,960
There.

3049
03:06:54,200 --> 03:06:57,060
Just a little bit of moving around a little bit.

3050
03:06:58,220 --> 03:06:58,740
Swap.

3051
03:06:59,820 --> 03:07:04,740
And now we wait for him to spin so we can get on...

3052
03:07:07,560 --> 03:07:08,780
so we can get on.

3053
03:07:14,280 --> 03:07:16,360
Oh, oh, oh, there we go.

3054
03:07:16,660 --> 03:07:18,760
Oh, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

3055
03:07:19,240 --> 03:07:21,100
Oh, no, no, no, no.

3056
03:07:21,100 --> 03:07:23,100
Oh, my gosh, I'm pressing all the wrong buttons now.

3057
03:07:23,580 --> 03:07:23,880
Okay.

3058
03:07:25,120 --> 03:07:27,200
Now we spirit...

3059
03:07:27,200 --> 03:07:29,980
Spirits, spits, spits, spits, spits, spits, spits, spits,
spits, spits, spits, spits, spits, spits, spits, spits,

3060
03:07:29,980 --> 03:07:30,540
spits, spits, spits.

3061
03:07:37,350 --> 03:07:37,830
Ressel!

3062
03:07:40,950 --> 03:07:42,730
Now the question is, do I need to...

3063
03:07:42,750 --> 03:07:53,290
umbrella opener closed i'm not quite sure at this part i'm
gonna try with it open i don't know why oh whoops my bad

3064
03:07:53,290 --> 03:08:00,470
okay okay now i'm gonna wait

3065
03:08:04,370 --> 03:08:18,620
oh what did that just do i so did not see that coming oh i
never thought the umbrella would catch the boss Did you see

3066
03:08:18,620 --> 03:08:18,840
that?

3067
03:08:18,900 --> 03:08:20,160
The tree branch shook a little.

3068
03:08:20,940 --> 03:08:22,220
I think I saw it shake too.

3069
03:08:23,060 --> 03:08:24,360
If only it shook a little more.

3070
03:08:25,400 --> 03:08:29,860
It would knock that terrible rugby ball down from this
terrible tree.

3071
03:08:31,040 --> 03:08:33,080
Maybe it just needs a little more weight.

3072
03:08:36,800 --> 03:08:38,000
Sure we can do this.

3073
03:08:38,100 --> 03:08:39,200
We just have to put our heads together.

3074
03:08:39,420 --> 03:08:43,700
Okay, well I'm doing all the thinking right now, Missile, so
I could really appreciate it if you're just like...

3075
03:08:44,920 --> 03:08:46,700
Everything looks good so far.

3076
03:08:46,780 --> 03:08:48,020
We just need one more up.

3077
03:08:48,720 --> 03:08:49,480
The tire.

3078
03:08:50,700 --> 03:08:51,960
Wait, do I have to restart?

3079
03:08:57,660 --> 03:08:58,020
Oh!

3080
03:09:09,470 --> 03:09:09,630
Oh!

3081
03:09:09,850 --> 03:09:10,130
Wait!

3082
03:09:10,270 --> 03:09:10,870
I get it!

3083
03:09:10,930 --> 03:09:11,190
I get it!

3084
03:09:11,290 --> 03:09:11,430
I get

3085
03:09:26,140 --> 03:09:26,260
it!

3086
03:09:26,280 --> 03:09:26,540
I get it!

3087
03:09:26,820 --> 03:09:27,800
What do you think, Missal?

3088
03:09:29,400 --> 03:09:29,760
Okay.

3089
03:09:30,220 --> 03:09:31,220
I think you can do it.

3090
03:09:31,540 --> 03:09:32,380
Put the ball there.

3091
03:09:32,660 --> 03:09:33,740
I think I can do it!

3092
03:09:34,900 --> 03:09:37,540
In just a few seconds, you'll swap Mino with the leaf.

3093
03:09:38,060 --> 03:09:41,700
And then from there, you can swap Mino with one... Mino, one
more time!

3094
03:09:42,260 --> 03:09:43,460
The final moment is near, Missal.

3095
03:09:43,560 --> 03:09:43,960
Are you ready?

3096
03:09:47,220 --> 03:09:48,470
Okay, don't mess it up.

3097
03:09:50,040 --> 03:09:51,560
I'm going ghost!

3098
03:09:55,540 --> 03:09:58,800
Okay, I have to wait for it to start falling, don't I?

3099
03:10:00,280 --> 03:10:01,440
Yeah, I can't reach it.

3100
03:10:01,540 --> 03:10:02,900
I have to wait for it to start falling.

3101
03:10:03,200 --> 03:10:04,220
Okay, here we go.

3102
03:10:12,530 --> 03:10:14,810
Please don't make me have to do all this over again.

3103
03:10:22,450 --> 03:10:22,830
Please!

3104
03:10:23,750 --> 03:10:23,890
Ah!

3105
03:10:23,910 --> 03:10:24,110
Ah!

3106
03:10:24,450 --> 03:10:25,170
Oh, there we go.

3107
03:10:25,430 --> 03:10:25,430
Okay.

3108
03:10:25,850 --> 03:10:28,290
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3109
03:10:29,670 --> 03:10:30,630
Watch me, Sissel!

3110
03:10:31,070 --> 03:10:31,610
Here I go!

3111
03:10:31,870 --> 03:10:32,670
Oh, it did it for me.

3112
03:10:32,810 --> 03:10:33,430
That's so nice.

3113
03:10:33,770 --> 03:10:34,630
The finishing touches.

3114
03:10:34,750 --> 03:10:35,630
You can do it, Missile.

3115
03:10:35,930 --> 03:10:37,270
Swap Mino with that ball.

3116
03:10:40,530 --> 03:10:40,970
Swap.

3117
03:10:43,470 --> 03:10:44,230
Oh, okay.

3118
03:10:45,730 --> 03:10:47,470
I didn't have to time anything at all.

3119
03:10:47,950 --> 03:10:48,330
Nice.

3120
03:10:49,550 --> 03:10:49,930
Woo-hoo!

3121
03:10:53,670 --> 03:10:54,390
How's that?

3122
03:10:55,410 --> 03:10:57,110
My head has been spared.

3123
03:10:58,170 --> 03:10:59,890
Surely that was a try worthy of the gods.

3124
03:11:00,930 --> 03:11:02,450
Now Mino is right where he belongs.

3125
03:11:03,390 --> 03:11:05,210
Okay, we did it again, didn't we?

3126
03:11:07,350 --> 03:11:07,910
Didn't we?

3127
03:11:08,050 --> 03:11:11,450
Yeah, he's still in the same position.

3128
03:11:12,930 --> 03:11:14,730
Nobody has to die.

3129
03:11:15,430 --> 03:11:16,010
Missile.

3130
03:11:16,370 --> 03:11:17,750
Good job, Missile and Mint.

3131
03:11:18,050 --> 03:11:19,170
Nice, Missile.

3132
03:11:24,480 --> 03:11:25,840
Missile and Minto.

3133
03:11:27,360 --> 03:11:30,760
Except for one brave little Huh?

3134
03:11:31,840 --> 03:11:33,820
I'm talking about you, Missou.

3135
03:11:34,960 --> 03:11:35,480
Oh, me?

3136
03:11:35,900 --> 03:11:36,720
I guess you're right.

3137
03:11:36,840 --> 03:11:37,900
I'm still dead, aren't I?

3138
03:11:38,960 --> 03:11:41,020
So now let's go back and save your life.

3139
03:11:43,460 --> 03:11:43,900
Wait a minute.

3140
03:11:44,700 --> 03:11:45,740
What is it?

3141
03:11:46,540 --> 03:11:47,740
Now that I think about it.

3142
03:11:48,380 --> 03:11:50,180
I think I want to stay dead a little longer.

3143
03:11:50,340 --> 03:11:50,820
Oh, okay.

3144
03:11:51,820 --> 03:11:52,020
What?

3145
03:11:52,740 --> 03:11:55,640
When I was alive, I couldn't even help Miss Camilla when she
was in trouble.

3146
03:11:56,380 --> 03:11:57,860
I want to be able to protect Miss Camilla.

3147
03:11:59,280 --> 03:12:02,260
that any of these powers I have now.

3148
03:12:05,180 --> 03:12:05,660
I see.

3149
03:12:07,360 --> 03:12:08,160
Perfectly understandable.

3150
03:12:09,140 --> 03:12:10,500
Even I wish I had powers like that.

3151
03:12:11,320 --> 03:12:12,280
Hey, we just saved you.

3152
03:12:12,440 --> 03:12:13,580
Don't wish your life away already.

3153
03:12:15,640 --> 03:12:16,560
Of course, you're right.

3154
03:12:16,860 --> 03:12:17,940
You're such a good boy.

3155
03:12:18,580 --> 03:12:20,200
Okay, Miss Alvin, you're away.

3156
03:12:22,140 --> 03:12:26,940
By the way, Mr. Reckless Youth, there's a certain detective
who needs that music box you found.

3157
03:12:30,160 --> 03:12:32,300
Oh, he's such a good boy, no.

3158
03:12:38,840 --> 03:12:41,620
When we get back to the present time, could you give it to
her?

3159
03:12:42,700 --> 03:12:44,160
Certainly, you have my word.

3160
03:12:48,500 --> 03:12:49,980
Let's go back to the present.

3161
03:12:59,310 --> 03:13:01,270
Okay, oh my god, he's still there.

3162
03:13:02,610 --> 03:13:04,830
And so Camilla ended up in the hands of the kidnappers.

3163
03:13:05,290 --> 03:13:06,770
We weren't able to change that part.

3164
03:13:08,530 --> 03:13:15,270
Wait, but we don't want her to have the the music box oh no

3165
03:13:15,270 --> 03:13:21,950

3166
03:13:25,110 --> 03:13:33,130
Lynn listen to my story without saying anything I'm sorry I
wish there was something else I could have done no he did

3167
03:13:33,130 --> 03:13:36,270

3168
03:13:37,010 --> 03:13:38,550
After all, she has me!

3169
03:13:41,730 --> 03:13:42,350
Missal!

3170
03:13:44,830 --> 03:13:45,450
Missal?

3171
03:13:45,870 --> 03:13:46,650
Are you in there?

3172
03:13:50,080 --> 03:13:51,180
Miss Lynn!

3173
03:13:51,360 --> 03:13:53,080
Leave Miss Camilla to me!

3174
03:13:54,060 --> 03:14:00,760
I know I don't look much like much, look like, much right
now, but I'm sure I can help her!

3175
03:14:02,600 --> 03:14:03,220
Missal.

3176
03:14:05,420 --> 03:14:06,040
Oh.

3177
03:14:07,380 --> 03:14:08,020
Missile!

3178
03:14:09,940 --> 03:14:10,580
Missile!

3179
03:14:13,380 --> 03:14:14,480
Oh no!

3180
03:14:19,620 --> 03:14:21,420
I'm gonna leave it up to Missile!

3181
03:14:21,480 --> 03:14:22,560
What are you talking about?

3182
03:14:25,720 --> 03:14:26,360
He's...

3183
03:14:29,370 --> 03:14:30,690
Oh my god.

3184
03:14:31,590 --> 03:14:34,390
It kind of looks like Missile is being left up to the wind.

3185
03:14:35,950 --> 03:14:36,110
Oh!

3186
03:14:36,550 --> 03:14:37,550
He's alive!

3187
03:14:39,490 --> 03:14:40,130
Oh!

3188
03:14:42,650 --> 03:14:43,290
Oh!

3189
03:14:44,990 --> 03:14:45,780
to give to you.

3190
03:14:47,830 --> 03:14:48,070
Da-da!

3191
03:14:48,350 --> 03:14:49,550
No, not.

3192
03:14:49,870 --> 03:14:52,170
Stop the park from being turned into a housing site.

3193
03:14:52,550 --> 03:14:53,230
Protect the park.

3194
03:14:53,370 --> 03:14:54,290
The rock of the gods.

3195
03:14:55,370 --> 03:14:56,670
Aren't you forgetting your promise?

3196
03:14:58,390 --> 03:15:00,130
Oh, pardon me, pardon me.

3197
03:15:02,010 --> 03:15:03,650
He's going on an adventure.

3198
03:15:04,390 --> 03:15:04,970
My apologies.

3199
03:15:05,290 --> 03:15:06,010
This is for you.

3200
03:15:07,470 --> 03:15:07,650
Oh.

3201
03:15:08,970 --> 03:15:10,690
Gonna need some more water soon.

3202
03:15:13,270 --> 03:15:14,970
You kept the music box safe, didn't you?

3203
03:15:14,990 --> 03:15:15,990
Thank you.

3204
03:15:18,530 --> 03:15:19,110
Not at all.

3205
03:15:19,310 --> 03:15:21,070
I was only doing with the Rock of the Gods.

3206
03:15:23,090 --> 03:15:24,990
Would have wanted...

3207
03:15:25,850 --> 03:15:27,210
Does he have a concussion or something?

3208
03:15:27,590 --> 03:15:28,750
What's wrong with him?

3209
03:15:29,550 --> 03:15:30,430
Mega Pocket.

3210
03:15:30,910 --> 03:15:31,310
What's the matter?

3211
03:15:31,430 --> 03:15:32,230
Cat got your tongue?

3212
03:15:32,590 --> 03:15:34,010
I think he thinks she's really pretty.

3213
03:15:35,470 --> 03:15:37,570
He's mesmerized by my beauty.

3214
03:15:41,750 --> 03:15:44,510
Hey, the cat's not allowed to get your tongue.

3215
03:15:48,080 --> 03:15:49,340
This is averted.

3216
03:15:49,980 --> 03:15:50,780
Evade, evade.

3217
03:15:53,620 --> 03:15:55,380
Excuse me, but are you?

3218
03:15:56,940 --> 03:15:57,860
No, it couldn't be.

3219
03:15:59,540 --> 03:16:00,340
Have we met before?

3220
03:16:01,480 --> 03:16:01,980
Aren't you?

3221
03:16:03,280 --> 03:16:06,260
That little girl from that time.

3222
03:16:08,100 --> 03:16:08,880
I'll never forget it.

3223
03:16:09,020 --> 03:16:10,540
It was 10 years ago in this park.

3224
03:16:11,680 --> 03:16:12,060
Shaggy!

3225
03:16:12,840 --> 03:16:13,760
Shaggy too.

3226
03:16:14,480 --> 03:16:15,820
Are you talking about...

3227
03:16:26,110 --> 03:16:29,090
Here in this park, the gods surely control fate.

3228
03:16:29,630 --> 03:16:30,930
Today, ten years from that day.

3229
03:16:31,750 --> 03:16:32,610
We meet once again.

3230
03:16:34,310 --> 03:16:36,750
If that isn't the power of the gods, then what else is it?

3231
03:16:38,230 --> 03:16:39,410
It could just be coincident.

3232
03:16:39,710 --> 03:16:40,750
He is lore.

3233
03:16:40,930 --> 03:16:41,830
I can't believe it.

3234
03:16:42,450 --> 03:16:44,310
But apparently, you know our lady detective here.

3235
03:16:45,470 --> 03:16:46,550
Could you tell us about it?

3236
03:16:46,770 --> 03:16:47,830
What happened ten years ago?

3237
03:16:49,070 --> 03:16:49,850
Yes, yes, of course.

3238
03:16:49,970 --> 03:16:51,590
I was actually about to do just that.

3239
03:16:53,590 --> 03:16:54,230
Rock of the gods.

3240
03:16:55,450 --> 03:16:57,490
What about this rock of the gods you keep mentioning?

3241
03:16:58,130 --> 03:16:58,630
Don't you know?

3242
03:16:58,710 --> 03:17:00,070
It's right there in front of us.

3243
03:17:00,650 --> 03:17:01,150
Me, no?

3244
03:17:03,450 --> 03:17:04,370
Oh, no, this place.

3245
03:17:06,970 --> 03:17:07,090
Oh!

3246
03:17:09,610 --> 03:17:09,990
Missile!

3247
03:17:11,850 --> 03:17:12,230
Aw!

3248
03:17:22,330 --> 03:17:22,930
Wait a minute.

3249
03:17:24,330 --> 03:17:26,470
You say gods, but do you mean dogs?

3250
03:17:27,230 --> 03:17:28,050
Of course not.

3251
03:17:28,310 --> 03:17:28,610
silly.

3252
03:17:29,310 --> 03:17:30,930
This is no time for ridiculous word games.

3253
03:17:31,990 --> 03:17:33,770
You are standing just above the Rock of the Gods.

3254
03:17:35,010 --> 03:17:37,270
Wait, you are standing just above the Rock of the Gods now.

3255
03:17:38,190 --> 03:17:39,490
Take a good look at that monument.

3256
03:17:40,830 --> 03:17:41,270
Monument?

3257
03:17:44,350 --> 03:17:45,450
Rock of the Gods.

3258
03:17:45,590 --> 03:17:46,490
Temsick Park.

3259
03:17:48,350 --> 03:17:51,050
The Rock of the... This took a turn that I did not expect at
all.

3260
03:17:51,450 --> 03:17:53,930
I mean, we've been dealing with...

3261
03:17:56,130 --> 03:18:03,270
We've been dealing with ghosts and all sorts of supernatural
stuff, but I did not, I don't know.

3262
03:18:05,610 --> 03:18:08,570
I don't, I did not expect something like this.

3263
03:18:09,250 --> 03:18:10,890
The rock is buried in the ground right there.

3264
03:18:11,050 --> 03:18:13,030
It's been there these 10 years.

3265
03:18:16,410 --> 03:18:19,510
Ever since that day, it flew down from the heavens and
showed us a miracle.

3266
03:18:21,430 --> 03:18:22,150
A miracle?

3267
03:18:27,660 --> 03:18:39,320
So this rock you've been talking about is a meteorite
precisely it's not a it's not a rock wait it's the opposite

3268
03:18:39,320 --> 03:18:50,700
it's not a boulder it's a rock it's a rock it dropped from
the sky on that day 10 years ago yes of course surely you

3269
03:18:50,700 --> 03:18:52,700
know all about it me

3270
03:18:58,020 --> 03:19:05,960
wait so did the mirror did the mirror the rock like strike
the guy so so the detective didn't actually shoot and kill

3271
03:19:05,960 --> 03:19:06,780
the person

3272
03:19:10,680 --> 03:19:19,180
that day i just happened to be passing through this park i
had no idea that day would change my destiny the sun was

3273
03:19:19,180 --> 03:19:22,960
going down and through the gloom i heard the scream of a
little girl

3274
03:19:28,780 --> 03:19:32,120
now just calm down and drop that weapon Stay back.

3275
03:19:32,220 --> 03:19:34,220
If you come any closer, I'll shoot her.

3276
03:19:36,740 --> 03:19:37,480
Oh my god.

3277
03:19:42,220 --> 03:19:44,500
That's not Cabanela, is it?

3278
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:45,300
No.

3279
03:19:46,480 --> 03:19:48,220
No, no, because the guy died.

3280
03:19:48,620 --> 03:19:49,800
But look at that stance.

3281
03:19:50,840 --> 03:19:53,420
It looks very skinny and tall.

3282
03:19:56,920 --> 03:20:00,860
I peeked out fearfully from the bushes and saw some shadowy
figures.

3283
03:20:02,720 --> 03:20:04,640
I didn't see the face of the criminal clearing.

3284
03:20:05,280 --> 03:20:07,840
I knew I should do something to help, but I couldn't move.

3285
03:20:10,600 --> 03:20:12,280
The tension was so thick, it was painful.

3286
03:20:13,080 --> 03:20:14,640
Just when I couldn't stand it any longer.

3287
03:20:15,460 --> 03:20:16,160
That's when it happened.

3288
03:20:16,540 --> 03:20:18,300
The sky suddenly burned bluish-white.

3289
03:20:20,200 --> 03:20:20,620
Whoa!

3290
03:20:24,060 --> 03:20:26,320
I came crashing down on him.

3291
03:20:30,160 --> 03:20:31,620
When it crashed into the ground,

3292
03:20:34,660 --> 03:20:37,420
The meteorite gave off a shower of beautiful fragments.

3293
03:20:38,880 --> 03:20:41,420
This is how we get the ghost trick.

3294
03:20:42,360 --> 03:20:53,900
If you die where the meteorite has been, has little pieces,
that's why missiles are more powerful than ours.

3295
03:21:02,620 --> 03:21:07,260
That's why, because missile died right next to me, the
biggest chunk of the meteorite.

3296
03:21:07,280 --> 03:21:22,440
right and maybe the guy that died by the meteor is the
manipulator stellar stellar the meteorite gave up shower of

3297
03:21:22,440 --> 03:21:28,060
beautiful fragments oh my god it's just like oh my gosh you
know what it is it's just like the shikon jewel from enu

3298
03:21:28,060 --> 03:21:34,980
yasha and then i saw it one of those beautiful fragments
pierced into the criminal's back

3299
03:21:40,370 --> 03:21:49,650
he's the manipulator he's got the power of the rock the
judgment of the gods was brought down on the park that day

3300
03:21:54,000 --> 03:22:05,280
ten years ago the little girl that was you was saved by the
rock of the gods why I can't believe it the rock of the gods

3301
03:22:05,280 --> 03:22:10,760
was given the name Temsik and still today it lies sleeping
deep in the parks Earth.

3302
03:22:13,520 --> 03:22:14,240
So...

3303
03:22:14,240 --> 03:22:16,380
Where we died, there was a fragment.

3304
03:22:19,920 --> 03:22:21,080
Maybe not a fragment.

3305
03:22:22,100 --> 03:22:23,540
Maybe what that guy!

3306
03:22:24,200 --> 03:22:25,820
The scientist in the park!

3307
03:22:25,940 --> 03:22:26,820
Wasn't he studying?

3308
03:22:27,700 --> 03:22:31,100
Wasn't he studying the, um, the rocks?

3309
03:22:34,920 --> 03:22:39,280
He was studying the rocks in the, in his little lab.

3310
03:22:45,160 --> 03:22:47,100
Maybe that's why we have the powers.

3311
03:22:49,440 --> 03:22:49,700
Temsic.

3312
03:22:51,040 --> 03:22:52,600
I never knew about this Temsic.

3313
03:22:55,240 --> 03:22:57,580
I always thought Detective Jowd was the one who saved me.

3314
03:22:58,580 --> 03:22:59,580
You were very young then.

3315
03:23:00,220 --> 03:23:02,660
And you passed out from the shock of being taken hostage.

3316
03:23:03,060 --> 03:23:04,200
Of course you wouldn't remember.

3317
03:23:05,940 --> 03:23:06,680
But that's funny.

3318
03:23:07,160 --> 03:23:09,680
A huge incident like that should have caused quite a stir.

3319
03:23:10,780 --> 03:23:12,180
It's strange you've never heard of it, Lynn.

3320
03:23:13,660 --> 03:23:19,440
isn't it now I think about it I remember I didn't want to
think about what happened I avoided the news and it never

3321
03:23:19,440 --> 03:23:28,900
came back to this park again that's why I didn't know
anything about it the meteorite was named Tamsik after the

3322
03:23:29,440 --> 03:23:35,860
after the name of this park that it fell in and then the
rock of the gods was forgotten now an awful thing is

3323
03:23:35,860 --> 03:23:41,260
happening they're talking about turning the park into a
housing site I'll never forget the miracle I witnessed that

3324
03:23:41,260 --> 03:23:51,800
day park and i'm trying to appeal to the people protect the
park protect the rock of the gods that is my mission what's

3325
03:23:51,800 --> 03:23:56,300
a kismet i keep seeing people saying that what is that i see

3326
03:24:00,060 --> 03:24:11,420
the real mystery is how old is this guy i was thinking that
too oh it means fate oh i see i see i'm taking you with me

3327
03:24:11,420 --> 03:24:23,670
missile So 10 years ago, the little girl that was Lynn
wasn't aware of the meteorite.

3328
03:24:24,570 --> 03:24:25,070
I get that.

3329
03:24:25,230 --> 03:24:29,210
But Detective Jowd, on the other hand, there's no way he
didn't know about this Temsik thing.

3330
03:24:30,050 --> 03:24:34,650
And if he knew, then the man died, I took his life.

3331
03:24:36,950 --> 03:24:38,870
What was that confession of his all about?

3332
03:24:39,330 --> 03:24:41,710
I think Detective Jowd is just stupid.

3333
03:24:44,330 --> 03:24:45,950
I think Kismet means Jaeger.

3334
03:24:47,550 --> 03:24:50,750
Jowd hunters is real name

3335
03:24:55,160 --> 03:25:05,700
If kismet equals fate Temsik equals reversed fate I like
that Oh that's so big brain Because we're reversing their

3336
03:25:05,700 --> 03:25:20,020
fates That's so cool Yeah um Detective Jowd like what the
hell Why are you always like I killed this guy.

3337
03:25:20,500 --> 03:25:21,320
No, you didn't.

3338
03:25:21,780 --> 03:25:24,340
And also, oh yeah, I killed the wife.

3339
03:25:24,800 --> 03:25:25,800
No, you didn't!

3340
03:25:26,320 --> 03:25:30,160
What is the point of being the hero in this situation?

3341
03:25:31,660 --> 03:25:33,400
What was that confession of his all about?

3342
03:25:36,420 --> 03:25:43,160
The rocks of the gods that fell from the sky 10 years ago
changed the destinies of many people's lives.

3343
03:25:46,380 --> 03:25:47,340
Fakura, thank you.

3344
03:25:48,920 --> 03:25:51,180
Please don't build houses on the meteorite.

3345
03:25:51,320 --> 03:25:53,200
The town will become very bizarre.

3346
03:25:53,680 --> 03:25:54,200
It's true.

3347
03:26:00,460 --> 03:26:03,180
Like the ripples on a pond when a pebble is dropped in.

3348
03:26:04,500 --> 03:26:06,780
With every answer I get, I learn about a new mystery.

3349
03:26:07,320 --> 03:26:09,660
Will I be able to break the chain of mysteries before dawn?

3350
03:26:12,360 --> 03:26:13,920
The biggest thing...

3351
03:26:15,220 --> 03:26:16,920
The biggest thing is...

3352
03:26:18,920 --> 03:26:20,300
I still don't know who Cicil is.

3353
03:26:20,760 --> 03:26:25,180
I tried cooking before, and I was way off, I think, so
I'm...

3354
03:26:25,880 --> 03:26:27,020
I'm still... I'm still...

3355
03:26:27,660 --> 03:26:30,020
You know, I'm trying not to think too much about it.

3356
03:26:30,580 --> 03:26:32,300
Trying to just see how it plays out.

3357
03:26:34,580 --> 03:26:38,920
Anyway, now that we have the evidence we need, we decided to
meet up again at the minister's office.

3358
03:26:39,440 --> 03:26:42,040
Besides, there are a few things I wanted to ask Detective
Jowd.

3359
03:26:45,600 --> 03:26:47,620
We are way off to find out who we are.

3360
03:26:53,660 --> 03:26:54,960
We're here, oh my gosh.

3361
03:26:55,560 --> 03:26:57,400
We found the music box, Detective Jowd.

3362
03:26:58,360 --> 03:26:59,000
Good job, Lin.

3363
03:26:59,260 --> 03:27:00,120
I knew you would.

3364
03:27:02,360 --> 03:27:05,400
Once everything has been resolved, I had wanted you to give
this to him.

3365
03:27:07,140 --> 03:27:07,460
Him?

3366
03:27:07,700 --> 03:27:09,160
You mean Inspector Cabanella, right?

3367
03:27:10,100 --> 03:27:12,260
I don't suppose he'll ever forgive me.

3368
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:13,820
Detective Jowd.

3369
03:27:15,060 --> 03:27:16,640
Now then, let's get this thing open.

3370
03:27:16,960 --> 03:27:18,640
There's a certain knack to doing it, you know.

3371
03:27:19,900 --> 03:27:20,280
Okay.

3372
03:27:22,280 --> 03:27:24,220
Oh, you just gotta pull it open.

3373
03:27:25,140 --> 03:27:26,000
Calls out a knack.

3374
03:27:26,580 --> 03:27:28,200
More like brute strength to me.

3375
03:27:31,340 --> 03:27:32,460
Oh, my...

3376
03:27:36,510 --> 03:27:38,590
It was the hammer space.

3377
03:27:40,310 --> 03:27:42,030
It's the hammer space.

3378
03:27:43,550 --> 03:27:44,110
Real.

3379
03:27:46,370 --> 03:27:47,330
You should...

3380
03:27:47,330 --> 03:27:49,530
You should find scorch marks on the grip.

3381
03:27:50,750 --> 03:27:51,390
Scorch marks.

3382
03:27:52,070 --> 03:27:54,990
When Camilla built her contraption, she used a special kind
of string.

3383
03:27:56,090 --> 03:27:57,670
Yeah, don't look down the barrel.

3384
03:27:57,890 --> 03:27:58,650
What's wrong with you?

3385
03:27:59,390 --> 03:28:00,710
It's a kind of magician's use.

3386
03:28:00,950 --> 03:28:02,950
It burns up in an instant and disappears.

3387
03:28:04,590 --> 03:28:06,330
Why would little Camilla use something like that?

3388
03:28:07,250 --> 03:28:07,810
I don't know.

3389
03:28:08,290 --> 03:28:09,870
Maybe because she's a detective's daughter.

3390
03:28:11,870 --> 03:28:13,750
Not leaving any evidence behind and all that.

3391
03:28:15,710 --> 03:28:18,310
In the case report, there was mentions of some scorch marks.

3392
03:28:20,510 --> 03:28:21,050
On what?

3393
03:28:24,380 --> 03:28:25,540
Oh, on the walls.

3394
03:28:25,820 --> 03:28:26,320
I'm supposed...

3395
03:28:26,320 --> 03:28:26,900
I'm guessing.

3396
03:28:27,720 --> 03:28:30,220
When it happened, Camilla was watching from her hiding
space.

3397
03:28:30,840 --> 03:28:31,720
Revolver jowled.

3398
03:28:31,840 --> 03:28:32,860
Revolver jowled.

3399
03:28:33,600 --> 03:28:38,400
She saw the flame run to the gun, something she naturally
didn't include in her design.

3400
03:28:44,520 --> 03:28:48,080
I took the gun out of the frame and replaced it with a
picture.

3401
03:28:48,840 --> 03:28:52,760
If you remove the picture, you should find scorch marks
behind it on the frame, too.

3402
03:28:53,680 --> 03:28:55,680
And those marks should match up with the ones on the gun.

3403
03:28:56,940 --> 03:28:59,580
In other words, it proves the control.

3404
03:28:59,600 --> 03:29:01,780
Attraction existed there in that room that day.

3405
03:29:02,920 --> 03:29:03,480
Hmm.

3406
03:29:05,940 --> 03:29:08,780
And it didn't work the way your little girl intended, is
that right?

3407
03:29:09,680 --> 03:29:10,100
Exactly.

3408
03:29:10,540 --> 03:29:12,680
Some cowardly culprit modified the design.

3409
03:29:14,560 --> 03:29:16,820
But that angle was never brought up in court.

3410
03:29:17,620 --> 03:29:21,620
And so as justice minister, I must call off the execution at
this point.

3411
03:29:22,680 --> 03:29:23,240
Yippee!

3412
03:29:24,680 --> 03:29:26,360
I knew I was right.

3413
03:29:29,600 --> 03:29:30,420
Detective Jowd.

3414
03:29:30,600 --> 03:29:32,040
Now we can finally prove that.

3415
03:29:34,560 --> 03:29:35,260
Thank goodness.

3416
03:29:39,400 --> 03:29:39,900
Thank you, Lynn.

3417
03:29:41,180 --> 03:29:45,240
In those eyes of yours, I see the eyes of that little girl
from ten years ago.

3418
03:29:58,530 --> 03:29:58,890
Cicel.

3419
03:30:00,530 --> 03:30:06,590
If you hadn't come to my cell tonight, I would be gone by
now without ever having known any of this.

3420
03:30:08,310 --> 03:30:09,550
This is what I deserve.

3421
03:30:10,570 --> 03:30:12,310
I told myself these past five years.

3422
03:30:14,810 --> 03:30:15,870
Well, things are different now.

3423
03:30:16,670 --> 03:30:18,490
Thanks to you, my eyes have finally been opened.

3424
03:30:19,490 --> 03:30:19,870
Tonight.

3425
03:30:20,910 --> 03:30:24,210
I've come into contact with a lot of people's lives and got
involved in their fates.

3426
03:30:24,350 --> 03:30:26,530
Yeah, don't I deserve to know who I am now?

3427
03:30:27,130 --> 03:30:30,150
The only reason I was doing that was to regain my own lost
memory.

3428
03:30:31,110 --> 03:30:32,270
But things are different now.

3429
03:30:32,970 --> 03:30:34,490
We're connected to each other somehow.

3430
03:30:34,650 --> 03:30:35,550
I just know it.

3431
03:30:37,130 --> 03:30:39,350
That's why I need to ask you a few more questions.

3432
03:30:40,570 --> 03:30:42,010
to find the truth about us.

3433
03:30:44,390 --> 03:30:46,470
Yeah, we gotta investigate the real mystery now.

3434
03:30:47,390 --> 03:30:47,710
Fair enough.

3435
03:30:48,070 --> 03:30:48,650
Fire away.

3436
03:30:48,790 --> 03:30:49,070
Sorry.

3437
03:30:49,750 --> 03:30:52,010
I'm, like, so invested in this now.

3438
03:30:52,450 --> 03:30:53,630
Let's check out the manipulator.

3439
03:30:55,610 --> 03:30:56,670
Hold on, I'm taking a sippy.

3440
03:30:56,770 --> 03:30:58,030
My throat is getting so dry.

3441
03:31:00,470 --> 03:31:00,830
Okay.

3442
03:31:01,410 --> 03:31:05,490
Yeah, I think I will stop after this just because my throat
is, like, I've been talking so much today.

3443
03:31:07,770 --> 03:31:09,850
Sissel told me all about it, Detective Jowd.

3444
03:31:10,650 --> 03:31:19,670
the manipulator yes and it looks like this manipulator
really did a number on the minister too please don't pick on

3445
03:31:19,670 --> 03:31:22,310
the minister if he dies again i'm the one who has to save
him

3446
03:31:25,970 --> 03:31:34,230
sisal do you think do you think that's what happened to me
too what are you talking about lynn yeah i think so don't

3447
03:31:34,230 --> 03:31:36,710
tell me you were manipulated too

3448
03:31:40,160 --> 03:31:42,540
there was always a part of me that just couldn't believe
believe it.

3449
03:31:44,920 --> 03:31:46,480
That image of the one who shot me.

3450
03:31:51,680 --> 03:31:54,200
But now I see the possibility of a new explanation.

3451
03:31:58,100 --> 03:32:00,660
But who is it?

3452
03:32:01,080 --> 03:32:02,220
And why did they do it?

3453
03:32:03,380 --> 03:32:03,740
Hmm.

3454
03:32:04,900 --> 03:32:05,820
Camilla's contraption.

3455
03:32:07,640 --> 03:32:10,420
That contraption was a birthday surprise for Camilla's
mother, wasn't it?

3456
03:32:10,900 --> 03:32:11,600
That's right.

3457
03:32:12,420 --> 03:32:20,780
something's been bothering me about it I feel like I know
that device from somewhere oh she finally realized no

3458
03:32:20,780 --> 03:32:29,500
surprise there you lost your life once once tonight because
of that machine right I knew it see detective Jowd oh I'm

3459
03:32:29,500 --> 03:32:36,580
afraid I don't see detective Jowd is a great detective if he
walks up to a crime scene and says he did it technically he

3460
03:32:36,580 --> 03:32:46,460
solved it and he gets the credit that's He has a spotless
record.

3461
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:48,060
It was me.

3462
03:32:51,300 --> 03:32:51,900
Flashback.

3463
03:32:52,180 --> 03:32:53,600
I told Detective Jowd about it.

3464
03:32:57,100 --> 03:33:00,800
Told him about seeing the exact same contraption tonight in
a completely different place.

3465
03:33:08,200 --> 03:33:09,880
That's very strange indeed.

3466
03:33:11,480 --> 03:33:12,880
I was like thinking for a second.

3467
03:33:13,060 --> 03:33:15,280
I was like, why would she think to know this?

3468
03:33:15,380 --> 03:33:16,580
Or rather...

3469
03:33:16,600 --> 03:33:17,500
Why did they do it?

3470
03:33:17,540 --> 03:33:18,700
They were doing a little silly.

3471
03:33:20,620 --> 03:33:25,080
Rather, I was thinking why does the... why did the scientist
guy know about it?

3472
03:33:28,080 --> 03:33:28,520
I'm...

3473
03:33:28,520 --> 03:33:30,360
You know...

3474
03:33:30,360 --> 03:33:36,760
Part of me is just like is he a bad guy and told her how to
make it and then knew how to manipulate it?

3475
03:33:38,840 --> 03:33:39,280
Um...

3476
03:33:39,280 --> 03:33:41,240
So that it would be...

3477
03:33:41,940 --> 03:33:43,940
It would be...

3478
03:33:43,940 --> 03:33:44,400
lethal?

3479
03:33:46,740 --> 03:33:47,180
Hmm.

3480
03:33:48,140 --> 03:33:50,040
Yeah, or the scientist was investigating.

3481
03:33:50,420 --> 03:33:53,540
Obviously, like, that's, you know, the other half.

3482
03:33:56,200 --> 03:33:56,640
But...

3483
03:33:56,640 --> 03:33:56,960
Hmm.

3484
03:33:57,920 --> 03:33:59,360
That's very strange indeed.

3485
03:34:00,720 --> 03:34:02,180
A junkyard on the edge of town.

3486
03:34:02,380 --> 03:34:03,560
I've never even heard of the place.

3487
03:34:04,480 --> 03:34:07,640
And what's more, I've never told a single soul about that
contraption.

3488
03:34:08,700 --> 03:34:09,360
You haven't?

3489
03:34:10,660 --> 03:34:12,120
Hmm, that old pigeon guy.

3490
03:34:12,620 --> 03:34:13,600
Who in the world is he?

3491
03:34:13,720 --> 03:34:14,040
Yeah!

3492
03:34:15,960 --> 03:34:16,400
Tomsek.

3493
03:34:17,060 --> 03:34:19,460
Detective Jowd, you must have heard this name before.

3494
03:34:20,140 --> 03:34:20,580
Temsik.

3495
03:34:21,560 --> 03:34:23,580
The meteorite that fell in the park ten years ago.

3496
03:34:24,080 --> 03:34:24,780
You were there.

3497
03:34:26,900 --> 03:34:28,660
So you found out about that, did you?

3498
03:34:29,000 --> 03:34:31,960
I heard that meteorite saved little Lynn's life.

3499
03:34:32,100 --> 03:34:33,020
And then you took the credit!

3500
03:34:34,080 --> 03:34:34,600
That's right.

3501
03:34:35,100 --> 03:34:36,900
I couldn't do anything to help Lynn that day.

3502
03:34:38,020 --> 03:34:39,320
But in that case, I don't get it.

3503
03:34:40,060 --> 03:34:43,500
If it's true, doesn't it mean you didn't steal somebody's
life away?

3504
03:34:45,400 --> 03:34:46,580
What are you talking about?

3505
03:34:47,200 --> 03:34:49,420
Detective Jowd, you told me that 10 years ago.

3506
03:34:50,220 --> 03:34:53,460
The person who killed the perpetrator in the park was you.

3507
03:34:54,780 --> 03:34:55,300
What?

3508
03:34:55,600 --> 03:34:55,740
What?

3509
03:34:55,800 --> 03:34:56,800
It was the meteorite!

3510
03:34:58,060 --> 03:34:59,760
Yeah, you weirdo.

3511
03:35:01,040 --> 03:35:02,420
I wasn't lying.

3512
03:35:03,240 --> 03:35:06,620
Also, this is totally unrelated, but it's been bothering me
for so long.

3513
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:17,100
Every time I see this portrait of Detective Jowd standing
right here with the text blocking him, his shirt reminds me

3514
03:35:17,100 --> 03:35:18,100
of Osumatsu-san.

3515
03:35:19,500 --> 03:35:20,500
He reminds me of...

3516
03:35:20,500 --> 03:35:21,180
Not Karamatsu.

3517
03:35:22,400 --> 03:35:23,720
With the pink one.

3518
03:35:24,340 --> 03:35:26,800
It makes me think of it every time.

3519
03:35:27,140 --> 03:35:29,100
And it distracts me so much.

3520
03:35:29,600 --> 03:35:30,900
What's the pink one's name?

3521
03:35:32,140 --> 03:35:32,320
Ah.

3522
03:35:34,420 --> 03:35:35,020
Ah.

3523
03:35:35,400 --> 03:35:36,580
Gosh, I can't remember.

3524
03:35:37,480 --> 03:35:38,180
To do Mats!

3525
03:35:40,520 --> 03:35:41,860
To do Mats!

3526
03:35:42,080 --> 03:35:43,760
I think of him every time.

3527
03:35:43,860 --> 03:35:45,460
He has a little design.

3528
03:35:46,520 --> 03:35:47,820
On Toti!

3529
03:35:52,330 --> 03:35:53,850
It's so funny.

3530
03:35:55,130 --> 03:35:58,230
If anybody's wondering, I was a Ju Shimatsu girl.

3531
03:35:58,910 --> 03:36:00,230
I wasn't lying.

3532
03:36:00,750 --> 03:36:02,170
I stole that man's life away.

3533
03:36:02,510 --> 03:36:03,510
No question about it.

3534
03:36:03,750 --> 03:36:05,550
It was entirely my fault.

3535
03:36:08,310 --> 03:36:11,310
I was just about to shoot him.

3536
03:36:13,490 --> 03:36:17,910
Ichimatsu was the sad guy, wasn't he?

3537
03:36:20,590 --> 03:36:24,030
I would have shot him in the next instant if the meteorite
hadn't come.

3538
03:36:25,710 --> 03:36:28,310
At that point, I was already a murderer.

3539
03:36:29,910 --> 03:36:31,770
That's not how that works.

3540
03:36:32,910 --> 03:36:33,910
That's not true.

3541
03:36:34,230 --> 03:36:35,670
You were trying to save me.

3542
03:36:36,250 --> 03:36:39,330
Lynn, I'm sorry, but I don't think that's really it.

3543
03:36:40,330 --> 03:36:40,430
Huh?

3544
03:36:43,150 --> 03:36:45,750
The truth about 10 years ago...

3545
03:36:46,310 --> 03:36:46,810
Uh-oh.

3546
03:36:47,050 --> 03:36:48,730
On that day, 10 years ago, a different...

3547
03:36:48,750 --> 03:36:50,870
happened in another place.

3548
03:36:51,690 --> 03:36:52,190
Another place?

3549
03:36:53,650 --> 03:36:56,490
Yes, in the police headquarters interrogation room.

3550
03:36:58,010 --> 03:36:59,490
This guy just can't stop lying.

3551
03:37:01,650 --> 03:37:02,790
The worst sort of incident.

3552
03:37:03,290 --> 03:37:05,070
A suspect who was being questioned escaped.

3553
03:37:05,990 --> 03:37:07,270
Wow, I didn't know about that.

3554
03:37:09,110 --> 03:37:12,350
I happened to be there in the detective division, so I
joined the chase.

3555
03:37:13,450 --> 03:37:14,910
Fortunately, or I guess unfortunately.

3556
03:37:15,950 --> 03:37:18,350
I was able to track him down alone in the park.

3557
03:37:20,210 --> 03:37:21,430
Hold it right there.

3558
03:37:23,490 --> 03:37:24,630
I fired a warning shot.

3559
03:37:24,970 --> 03:37:26,190
I wanted to catch him bad.

3560
03:37:27,150 --> 03:37:28,710
That warning shot made him panic.

3561
03:37:32,450 --> 03:37:38,070
At the time, I was a young and green detective, brandishing
my sense of justice like a sword.

3562
03:37:39,270 --> 03:37:41,250
I made him panic and got you involved, Lin.

3563
03:37:41,610 --> 03:37:42,610
It was all my fault.

3564
03:37:46,830 --> 03:37:47,790
Detective Jowd.

3565
03:37:48,950 --> 03:37:50,370
All I could see was my target.

3566
03:37:51,170 --> 03:37:51,850
see you.

3567
03:37:52,910 --> 03:38:01,130
I'm so sorry, So he didn't really have her interest in best,
her safety in mind is what he's trying to say.

3568
03:38:02,610 --> 03:38:04,390
My sword is a tool of justice.

3569
03:38:05,430 --> 03:38:08,530
Well, you know what they say about that sword.

3570
03:38:10,870 --> 03:38:12,770
So the man who grabbed me died that day.

3571
03:38:13,950 --> 03:38:15,130
These last ten years.

3572
03:38:15,690 --> 03:38:17,070
I've never forgotten his face.

3573
03:38:17,870 --> 03:38:22,150
And then a few years after that, when my wife Alma died in
such a mysterious way.

3574
03:38:23,590 --> 03:38:24,350
I thought it was fate.

3575
03:38:24,550 --> 03:38:26,190
My punishment was for what I'd done.

3576
03:38:27,930 --> 03:38:32,570
I mean, that would make sense why the manipulator went after
Zhao's wife.

3577
03:38:33,190 --> 03:38:34,170
He's just like...

3578
03:38:36,430 --> 03:38:37,490
Revenge, baby.

3579
03:38:38,570 --> 03:38:39,170
Revenge!

3580
03:38:45,540 --> 03:38:46,400
Cha-cha.

3581
03:38:46,920 --> 03:38:48,440
I've painted pictures in my cell.

3582
03:38:48,680 --> 03:38:50,460
Nothing but portraits of people's faces.

3583
03:38:51,520 --> 03:38:53,780
Sa- 13.

3584
03:38:54,180 --> 03:38:54,660
Welcome to membership.

3585
03:38:54,780 --> 03:38:55,260
Thank you.

3586
03:38:57,060 --> 03:39:00,700
All the faces of the many people I met in my life and didn't
want to forget.

3587
03:39:02,880 --> 03:39:03,480
Revengeance.

3588
03:39:06,020 --> 03:39:09,260
And tonight, it was our face.

3589
03:39:09,400 --> 03:39:09,860
It was Cicel.

3590
03:39:10,640 --> 03:39:12,240
I finished my last portrait.

3591
03:39:12,660 --> 03:39:14,460
The final face I wanted to remember.

3592
03:39:22,080 --> 03:39:23,580
The final face.

3593
03:39:25,420 --> 03:39:27,720
The face of the man in the park that day.

3594
03:39:27,900 --> 03:39:28,020
Huh?

3595
03:39:32,580 --> 03:39:34,480
Wait, just one minute!

3596
03:39:35,640 --> 03:39:36,200
That can't be!

3597
03:39:36,640 --> 03:39:37,660
I saw that painting!

3598
03:39:38,900 --> 03:39:40,480
I saw the face you painted tonight!

3599
03:39:44,080 --> 03:39:44,580
What?

3600
03:39:46,840 --> 03:39:48,560
It was my face!

3601
03:39:50,600 --> 03:39:53,660
Are you telling me I was the man in the park that time?

3602
03:39:57,910 --> 03:40:08,510
right that face of yours is the face I saw 10 years ago the
face of the man whose life I stole of the man who was

3603
03:40:08,510 --> 03:40:20,970
pronounced dead at the scene but but hold on detective Jowd
I can't be true I just met Cicel for the first time tonight

3604
03:40:20,970 --> 03:40:26,350
did Someone reverse our fate?

3605
03:40:27,230 --> 03:40:27,470
Somehow.

3606
03:40:28,310 --> 03:40:28,530
Maybe.

3607
03:40:30,110 --> 03:40:32,630
Did he think we were dead, but then someone revert- Huh?

3608
03:40:35,050 --> 03:40:37,230
And he died right in front of me!

3609
03:40:39,310 --> 03:40:44,870
By the way, the name that I know the man in the park that
day by isn't Cicil.

3610
03:40:45,850 --> 03:40:46,190
What?

3611
03:40:47,250 --> 03:40:51,150
From the first minute I laid eyes on you tonight, I've been
wondering.

3612
03:40:51,890 --> 03:40:53,570
Who in the world is this guy?

3613
03:40:56,370 --> 03:40:56,930
Mr.

3614
03:41:03,820 --> 03:41:04,200
Minister.

3615
03:41:05,060 --> 03:41:06,740
Inspector Cabanela, where are you?

3616
03:41:07,100 --> 03:41:08,660
Oh, he's at the Pigeon Man.

3617
03:41:10,240 --> 03:41:11,620
Just be quiet and listen.

3618
03:41:12,040 --> 03:41:13,160
This is our demand!

3619
03:41:15,420 --> 03:41:16,880
You double-crosser, you!

3620
03:41:17,060 --> 03:41:17,680
I knew it!

3621
03:41:18,200 --> 03:41:18,700
Demand?

3622
03:41:19,100 --> 03:41:20,380
Our demand hasn't changed.

3623
03:41:20,540 --> 03:41:21,880
The execution must be enough.

3624
03:41:22,160 --> 03:41:23,440
Unless he's being manipulated.

3625
03:41:24,300 --> 03:41:26,980
Once we've confirmed it's been carried out, we'll release
the hostage.

3626
03:41:28,940 --> 03:41:37,100
about inspector Cabanela and you know it wasn't my daughter
who was abducted does it really matter who the hostage is a

3627
03:41:37,100 --> 03:41:45,000
laugh is a laugh even if it's the daughter of a death row
prisoner once the criminal gets the punishment he deserves

3628
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:50,920
the hostage will go free carry out the execution immediately
and wait for our call

3629
03:41:54,500 --> 03:41:56,920
what is it mr.

3630
03:41:56,980 --> 03:42:04,320
minister you look paler than ever I think he's What in the
world?

3631
03:42:05,000 --> 03:42:06,100
What is going on?

3632
03:42:06,200 --> 03:42:07,180
Inspector Cabanela!

3633
03:42:08,460 --> 03:42:10,160
Oh my god, what is going on?

3634
03:42:10,400 --> 03:42:17,680
And for real, the rock of the gods that fell from the sky 10
years ago twisted the fate of many people and started a

3635
03:42:17,680 --> 03:42:18,980
chain of tragic events.

3636
03:42:21,200 --> 03:42:23,540
And even now, the chain continues to grow even longer.

3637
03:42:24,180 --> 03:42:25,980
Inspector Cabanela's call proved that to us.

3638
03:42:29,360 --> 03:42:30,000
What the hell?

3639
03:42:32,520 --> 03:42:34,940
The greatest mystery of all has risen to the surface.

3640
03:42:35,540 --> 03:42:37,720
Who is this me I've been chasing all night?

3641
03:42:39,360 --> 03:42:41,280
The music is so awesome.

3642
03:42:41,700 --> 03:42:43,580
Who am I?

3643
03:42:43,720 --> 03:42:44,280
I'm Minto!

3644
03:42:46,140 --> 03:42:48,460
I'm even further from knowing than when I started.

3645
03:42:54,330 --> 03:42:56,090
Who am I?

3646
03:42:58,170 --> 03:43:00,470
Wow, it's 2.55 a.m.

3647
03:43:00,470 --> 03:43:01,290
Oh my goodness.

3648
03:43:02,870 --> 03:43:03,950
The link's past.

3649
03:43:04,730 --> 03:43:05,490
Save the data.

3650
03:43:07,970 --> 03:43:09,010
Stop the playing.

3651
03:43:17,050 --> 03:43:17,490
Wow.

3652
03:43:22,490 --> 03:43:22,930
Wow.

3653
03:43:23,570 --> 03:43:28,490
I think, yeah, I think we'll finish it tomorrow.

3654
03:43:29,990 --> 03:43:30,430
We stopped.

3655
03:43:30,550 --> 03:43:31,610
We have three more.

3656
03:43:32,810 --> 03:43:33,670
16, 17, and 18.

3657
03:43:34,790 --> 03:43:35,310
Oh, no, wait.

3658
03:43:35,570 --> 03:43:36,710
We left on 14, right?

3659
03:43:36,830 --> 03:43:37,330
Hold on.

3660
03:43:40,490 --> 03:43:42,330
15, 16, 17, 18, wait.

3661
03:43:43,930 --> 03:43:45,710
15, 16, 17, 18.

3662
03:43:45,930 --> 03:43:48,170
Okay, so four, one, two, three, four.

3663
03:43:48,510 --> 03:43:48,730
Four more.

3664
03:43:51,350 --> 03:43:52,130
Four more.

3665
03:43:53,670 --> 03:43:54,150
Four more.

3666
03:43:55,870 --> 03:43:59,710
And that'll be part five, which I think is a good, like,
uh...

3667
03:43:59,710 --> 03:44:01,050
You're upstream.

3668
03:44:01,230 --> 03:44:02,210
A good...

3669
03:44:03,810 --> 03:44:04,670
Uh, number.

3670
03:44:05,370 --> 03:44:07,730
You wouldn't have been able to stop if you got any further.

3671
03:44:07,830 --> 03:44:08,650
I don't think so either.

3672
03:44:09,210 --> 03:44:12,790
We haven't seen the blue guy and his henchmen from the
beginning in a long time.

3673

being kind of silly.

03:46:15,160 --> 03:46:17,680
It always gets delayed after a certain amount of time.

3700
03:46:17,940 --> 03:46:18,200
Uh-oh.

3721
03:46:58,930 --> 03:47:06,530

3723
03:47:16,650 --> 03:47:25,510

top gun collab with umabusebe

3724
03:47:42,220 --> 03:47:51,980

3727
03:48:30,380 --> 03:48:37,180
wait it's two years and a week ago Oh my god, you're right.

3728
03:48:37,300 --> 03:48:37,960
It says 2022.

3729
03:48:42,760 --> 03:48:44,380
Why did nobody ever tell me?

3730
03:48:45,740 --> 03:48:49,160
This page is probably going to wonder why I retweeted their
thing.

3731
03:48:52,840 --> 03:48:56,100
I guess it would make sense when the movie came out, right?

3732
03:48:56,600 --> 03:48:58,100
Because it wouldn't make sense.

3733
03:48:59,320 --> 03:49:03,240
It wouldn't make sense if it was now.

3734
03:49:03,380 --> 03:49:04,440
I was like...

3735
03:49:07,560 --> 03:49:12,720
It wouldn't make sense if it's like, I was like, why is it,
why is Top Gun doing a thing now?

3736
03:49:13,660 --> 03:49:13,980
Right?

3737
03:49:15,060 --> 03:49:16,360
Movie's a little old now.

3738
03:49:16,580 --> 03:49:18,080
It's still new in my heart.

3739
03:49:19,380 --> 03:49:21,020
I think that's why I didn't even question it.

3740
03:49:21,160 --> 03:49:23,280
I was like, I just watched it yesterday.

3741
03:49:30,120 --> 03:49:30,840
